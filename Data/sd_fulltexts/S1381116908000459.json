Graphical abstract Among metal ion-exchanged montmorillonite (M n+-mont) and various Fe3+ catalysts, Fe3+-mont was most effective for the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride. Using probe molecules sensitive to Lewis acid, IR and microcalorimetric experiments were conducted for characterizing acidity of each catalyst, and the relationship between the acidity and catalytic activity is discussed. Catalytic activity of 14 types of metal ion-exchanged montmorillonite K-10 clay (M n+-mont) is tested for the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride at room temperature. The activity increases with an increase in the charge/radius ratio of exchanged cation. The activity of Fe3+-mont is the highest and is higher than those of other Fe3+ catalysts, FeCl3·6H2O and FeCl3/SiO2, conventional acid catalysts, Al2O3 and HZSM5, and homogeneous Lewis acid, Sc(OTf)3. Fe3+-mont exhibits a high turnover numbers (TON=49,500) and can be recycled without a loss in activity. Acidity of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 was characterized by IR spectroscopy using three probe molecules: pyridine, acetonitrile and acetone. These catalysts dominantly act as Lewis acid, and the Lewis acid strength changes in the order of Fe3+-mont>Yb3+-mont>FeCl3/SiO2, as suggested by acetone adsorption microcalorimety. From the relationship between the activity and the acidic character, factors affecting the catalytic activity for the acetylation are discussed. Keywords Acetylation Montmorillonite K-10 clay FTIR Microcalorimety 1 Introduction The acetylation of alcohols is a fundamental process in organic chemistry and provides a cheap and efficient means for protecting OH groups during oxidation, peptide coupling and glycosidation reactions. A variety of procedures follow the transesterification methodology, routinely performed under homogeneous catalysis with acetic acid or acetyl chloride and anhydride in the presence of a convenient basic (amine, DMAP) or acidic (toluene-p-sulfonic acid) catalyst [1,2]. Recently, transition metal- or lanthanide complexes-based Lewis acids, such as Sc(OTf)3, Sn(OTf)2, and Cu(OTf)2, have been developed as chemoselective and active catalysts for the acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride under mild reaction conditions [3–5]. When industrially applied, however, homogeneous catalysts generally bear the problems of catalyst–product separation and wasted inorganics which are hardly reused. Immobilization of Lewis acid on inorganic supports or use of heterogeneous acid catalysts [6–8] can overcome these problems. Acidic clays are widely used as catalysts in organic syntheses [7–18]. Their acid-properties and, thus, their catalytic performance depend on the exchanged cations. Water molecules in the hydration sphere of metal cations can dissociate to produce acidic protons (Brønsted acids). When the coordination of an organic compound to the metal cation is accompanied by expulsion of the water coordinating to the metal cation, the metal cation is electron pair accepters and can potentially act as Lewis acid catalyst [11,12,17]. Thus, the clay the proton of which is exchanged for a metal cation with high hydration enthalpy, such as Fe3+, can be a solid acid exhibiting both Brønsted and Lewis acidity, depending on the nature of the reactant molecule. The strength of Lewis acid sites can be increased by changing the exchangeable cation, and many workers have reported that Fe3+-exchanged clays exhibit the strongest Lewis acid sites [12–17]. On the other hand, acid activated clays, montmorillonite K-10 and KSF, have been reported as a remarkable catalyst for acetylation of various alcohols and phenols with acetic anhydride [8]. Knowing the fact that acid activated clays are not stable in the H+-exchanged form and their auto-transformation results in the gradual dissolution of metal ions, such as Al3+ and Fe3+, from the lattice which take the place of H+ ions in cation exchange sites [18], one hypothesizes that catalytic activity of K-10 and KSF clays for acetylation reaction could originate from the auto-exchanged cations. In this study, we show the effect of exchanged cations in montmorillonite K-10 on acid-properties and catalytic performance for acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride as a test reaction. For Fe3+-exchanged montmorillonite K-10 (Fe3+-mont) as the most active catalyst, catalytic behavior as well as the recycling characteristics is presented to exemplify the effectiveness of this catalytic system. Using probe molecules sensitive to Lewis acid, acetonitrile [19–22] and acetone [23–25], IR and microcalorimetric experiments are conducted for characterizing acidity of each catalyst, and relationship between the acidity and the catalytic activity is discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Montmorillonite K-10 clay purchased from Aldrich has surface area (S BET) of 220m2 g−1 and the following chemical composition (average value): SiO2 (73.0%), Al2O3 (14.0%), Fe2O3 (2.7%), CaO (0.2%), MgO (1.1%), Na2O (0.6%), K2O (1.9%) [26]. The basal (001) reflection was not observed in the XRD pattern of K-10, which confirms the delamination of the layered structure of the montmorillonite as reported in the literature [11]. Amorphous silica (JRC-SIO-8, a reference catalyst of the Catalysis Society of Japan, S BET =303m2 g−1), Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-8, surface area=148m2 g−1), and HZSM5 zeolite (JRC-Z5-25H, SiO2/Al2O3 =25) were supplied from the Catalysis Society of Japan. Ion-exchanged K-10 clay samples (M n+-mont) were prepared by treating the support with aqueous solution of metal salts for 3h at ca. 300K, followed by centrifuging and washing with deionized water, and by drying in vacuo at 300K. The metal content in each sample was determined by ICP analysis and listed in Table 1 . FeCl3·6H2O supported on silica gel (FeCl3/SiO2, Fe=0.1mmolg−1) was prepared by mixing the supports with aqueous solution of FeCl3·6H2O, followed by a complete removal of the solvent at 353K. FTIR measurement of adsorbed base molecules on various solid acids was performed with JASCO FT/IR-620. The sample was pressed into ca. 0.03g of self-supporting wafers and mounted into a quartz IR cell with CaF2 windows, and the sample was evacuated under vacuum at 423K for 1h. A base molecule, pyridine (15Torr), CD3CN (10Torr) or acetone (30Torr), was dosed on the evacuated samples from the gas phase through a vacuum manifold directly connected to the cell, followed by evacuation at a fixed temperature for 0.5h. Then, a difference spectrum was recorded at room temperature. CD3CN was used instead of CH3CN to avoid the well-known spectroscopic complication due to Fermi resonance between the ν(CN) vibration and the combination mode δ(CH3)+ν(CC) [19–22]. Microcalorimetric measurement of acetone adsorption was performed at 323K using a calorimeter (Tokyo Rikou Co., HAC-450G) connected to a volumetric glass line (308K) with on-line injection system for pulsing acetone gas. Before the adsorption experiments the sample (0.1g) was pretreated under vacuum for 1h at 423K. 2.2 Catalytic test The acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride (Scheme 1 ) was carried out by stirring the reaction mixture containing cyclohexanol (5mmol), acetic anhydride (6mmol), CH2Cl2 (1cm3) and catalysts (typically, 0.05mol% of metal cation with respect to cyclohexanol) at room temperature in air (in the presence of moisture). The solid catalysts were used without any pretreatment. Progress of the reaction was monitored by GC analysis of aliquots using n-decane as internal standard. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic tests on acetylation For the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride was tested by montmorillonite K-10 the proton of which is exchanged for 14 types of metal cations listed in Table 1. Each catalyst showed a high yield of acetylation product (above 92%) and cyclohexanol conversion (100%) after 24h except for Mn2+ (74% yield) and Na+ (5% yield) catalysts (results not shown). No by-products, such as cyclohexene, were observed by GC analysis. The inactive nature of Na+-mont means that the catalytically active sites in M n+-mont catalysts must be the exchanged cations. Fig. 1A shows the time course of the acetylation reaction with selected M n+-mont catalysts. The results show that the reaction rates depend strongly on the type of metal cation and changes in the order Fe3+ >Yb3+ >Zn2+ >Pb2+ >Ni2+ >Na+. The rate per gram of catalyst and the intrinsic rate per metal center, i.e. turnover frequency (TOF) are summarized in Table 1. After each experiment, the percentage of metal cations leached out from the solid catalyst to the solution was determined by ICP analysis of the filtrate after the reaction in Table 1. The results show that excellent to moderate resistivity of M n+-mont catalysts against metal leaching (0–1.8% leaching). Together with a significant influence of metal cation on the reaction rate, it is shown that the acetylation activity of M n+-mont catalysts originates from metal cations supported on the clay. Rate per gram of catalyst and the intrinsic rate per metal center (TOF) were plotted as a function of the ratio of charge and ionic radius [27–29], e/r, and the electronegativity of cations [30] in Fig. 2 . Although there are some deviations from the curves, there are general tendencies for TOF and the reaction rate per gram of catalyst to increase with increase in the e/r value and the electronegativity of cations. The ratio e/r is an approximate measure for the Lewis acidity of metal cations [28,29], and the electronegativity of cation has been used as a parameter of electron-withdrawing ability of metal cation. Hence, it is suggested that higher Lewis acidity results in a higher reaction rate. To investigate the effect of clay support, the catalytic activity of Fe3+-mont was compared with those of FeCl3·6H2O (a homogeneous catalyst), FeCl3/SiO2 and conventional acids (Table 2 ). With conventional Brønsted acid (HZSM5 zeolite) and Lewis acid (Al2O3) no or only low yields (7%) were obtained. Among Fe catalysts, the yield and rate per Fe (TOF) depended strongly on the support and increased in the order of Fe3+-mont≫FeCl3/SiO2 >FeCl3·6H2O. Reusability of the Fe3+-mont catalyst was tested. After the first run, the catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by a simple centrifugation and can be recycled at least four times with almost quantitative yields kept without any reactivation-treatment. The initial rate did not markedly decrease in the catalyst recycle tests (TOF=5600 and 4300h−1 for cycles 1 and 5, respectively). It is noteworthy that the heterogeneous catalyst, Fe3+-mont, showed higher TOF than Sc(OTf)3, one of the most effective homogeneous catalyst for this reaction [3]. Fig. 1B shows the time course of the acetylation of cyclohexanol over Fe3+-mont with a low catalyst concentration (Fe=0.002mol%). A complete conversion of cyclohexanol, 99% yield of the product (99% selectivity), and a high TON (49,500) were attained, indicating the high activity and durability of Fe3+-mont. 3.2 IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on various catalysts in the ring-stretching region are shown in Fig. 3 . Samples were first evacuated at 423K for 0.5h. All spectra of adsorbed species are background subtracted and are obtained after contact with pyridine vapor (15Torr) at 300K for 0.5h and successive evacuation at 473K for 0.5h. According to the literature of pyridine adsorption on montmorillonite K-10 clay [11,14,15] and metal oxides [19,21,22,31], the bands are assigned in the following way. Pyridinium ion (PyH+) produced by the reaction of pyridine with Brønsted acid site shows bands near 1537 and 1637cm−1. Coordinatively bound pyridine on Lewis acid site shows bands at 1450 and 1610cm−1. Physisorbed or hydrogen-bonded pyridine shows bands at 1440 and 1597cm−1. The band around 1490cm−1 is common to vibrations due to PyH+ and coordinatively bound pyridine. Bands assignable to coordinatively bound pyridine were observed for Fe3+-mont (1450 and 1610cm−1), Yb3+-mont (1445 and 1602cm−1) and FeCl3/SiO2 (1450 and 1618cm−1). These bands are stable to outgassing at 473K. This indicates that these bands are not assignable to hydrogen-bonded pyridine on metal oxides, which is known to be unstable to outgassing at temperature as low as 370K [30]. The above assignment is also supported by comparison with IR experiments of pyridine dosed on Al2O3 (a solid characterized by strong Lewis acid sites), where bands at 1610 and 1450cm−1 were observed. In the spectra of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2, the intensity of the band due to PyH+ (1540cm−1) was very weak. From these results, it is found that acid sites of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 are predominantly Lewis acidic in nature. This means that the metal cation acts as electron pair accepters and can potentially act as Lewis acid catalyst. 3.3 IR spectra of adsorbed CD3CN Fig. 4 shows IR spectra in the CN stretching region obtained after acetonitrile-d3 (CD3CN) adsorption on various catalysts pre-evacuated at 423K for 0.5h. All spectra were obtained after contact with CD3CN vapor (10Torr) at 300K for 0.5h and successive evacuation at a certain temperature for 0.5h. Acetonitrile is sensitive to Lewis acid strength; electron withdrawal from the nitrogen lone pair upon coordination leads to an increase in the ν(CN) frequency [21]. Based on the previous band assignments for CD3CN adsorbed on Al2O3 and zeolites [19–21], bands at 2315–2340, 2300, 2273 and 2250cm−1 are attributed to interaction of the nitrile group with Al3+ Lewis acid sites, strong Brønsted acid sites on zeolite, SiOH groups, and the asymmetric stretching vibration of physisorbed CD3CN, respectively. Bonino et al. [22] reported IR study of CD3CN adsorbed on TS-1 catalyst and assigned the band at 2302cm−1 to a direct interaction of CN with Ti(IV) which acts as a medium-strength Lewis site. As shown in Fig. 4, bands at 2304 and 2272cm−1 were observed in the spectra for Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2. For Fe3+-mont and Yb3+-mont, an additional shoulder band was observed at 2330cm−1. Taking into account the result of pyridine adsorption IR (Fig. 3), which indicate that these three solids are Lewis acidic in nature, the bands at 2304 and 2330cm−1 can be attributed to interaction of the CN group with Lewis acid sites with medium and strong acid strength, respectively. The band at 2272cm−1 is assigned to interaction of the CN group with SiOH groups. Outgassing the samples at higher temperature causes an intensity decrease in the bands due to CD3CN coordinated to M n+ (2330, 2304cm−1) and SiOH groups (2272cm−1). The band intensity at 2304cm−1 is plotted as a function of outgassing temperature in Fig. 5 . After outgassing at 473K, the band at 2304cm−1 completely disappeared for FeCl3/SiO2, whereas this band was still observed for M n+-mont, indicating the high Lewis acid strength of M n+-mont compared to FeCl3/SiO2. From desorption experiments of Fe3+-mont and Yb3+-mont at increasing temperatures, it clearly appears that coordinated species characterized by the band at 2330cm−1 were more strongly adsorbed than those corresponding to the band at 2304cm−1, since the intensity of the latter preferentially decreased with temperature. This supports the above band assignment: CD3CN species with higher wavenumber (2330cm−1) is coordinated to Lewis acid sites with higher acid strength than those coordinated to medium-strength Lewis sites (2304cm−1). The higher thermal stability of coordinated species on Fe3+-mont than those on FeCl3/SiO2 as well as the presence of coordinated species with higher wavenumber (2330cm−1) indicate that Lewis acid strength of Fe3+ on the clay is higher than that on SiO2. Fig. 6 (solid line) shows the spectrum obtained after CD3CN adsorption on Fe3+-mont pre-evacuated at 300K for 0.5h. A band due to CD3CN coordinated to medium-strength Lewis acid site (2304cm−1) and a shoulder band due to CD3CN on strong Lewis acid site (2330cm−1) were observed, and the band intensity was not lower than that for Fe3+-mont pre-evacuated at 423K (dashed line). In parallel, a negative band at 1625cm−1 due to adsorbed water was observed. These results indicate that water molecule coordinated to Fe3+ Lewis acid sites was replaced by CD3CN, and Fe3+ species on the clay potentially act as Lewis acid catalyst even in the presence of water in the first coordination sphere. Several authors reported that CD3CN adsorption on Al2O3 dehydrated at high temperature (typically above 873K) resulted in the formation of CD3CN bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ Lewis sites (2315–2340cm−1) [20,21]. The IR spectrum measured after CD3CN adsorption on Al2O3, which was pre-evacuated at 423K, showed a band at 2262cm−1 due to H-bonded species (Fig. 4). Outgassing at 373K led to desorption of all the H-bonded species. Taking into account the results in Fig. 3, it is shown that the surface of Al2O3 partially dehydrated at low temperature (423K) has Lewis acidity toward strong base, pyridine, but does not have Lewis acidity toward weak base, CD3CN. On the other hand, the hydrated metal cation in Fe3+-mont shows Lewis acidity toward weak base, CD3CN, because coordination of CD3CN to the metal cation is accompanied by expulsion of the water coordinating to the metal cation. 3.4 Acetone adsorption experiments Fig. 7 presents IR spectra of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 taken after their exposure to acetone (30Torr) for 0.5h and successive evacuation at certain temperature for 0.5h. Previous IR studies of acetone adsorption on metal oxides [23–25] have established that at room temperature acetone molecule is irreversibly adsorbed on coordinatively unsaturated M n+ Lewis acid sites (CH3)2CO→M n+), which shows ν(CO) bands around 1678–1702cm−1. It is also known that physisorbed acetone shows a ν(CO) band at 1710–1715cm−1 [23–25]. In the spectrum of Fe3+-mont, bands at 1696cm−1 with shoulder bands at 1712, 1702 and 1682cm−1 were observed. A band at 1696cm−1 was also observed for FeCl3/SiO2. Thus, a band at 1696cm−1 and shoulder bands at 1702 and 1682cm−1 are assigned to acetone coordinated to Lewis acid sites. A shoulder band at 1712cm−1 is assigned to physisorbed acetone. For all samples evacuated at 300K, ν(CO) band around 1607cm−1 assignable to mesityl oxide on Lewis acid site [23,24] was negligible, confirming that coordinated acetone does not undergo aldolcondensation-type reaction. The spectrum of acetone adsorbed on Yb3+-mont showed basically the same feature as that on Fe3+-mont. Desorption experiments at increasing temperatures were performed to investigate the stability of adsorbed acetone. The band intensity at 1696cm−1 is plotted as a function of outgassing temperature in Fig. 5. For FeCl3/SiO2, the band completely disappeared after outgassing at 373K, and for Yb3+-mont the band disappeared at 473K. However, it was still observed for Fe3+-mont even after evacuation at 473K. This indicates that acetone coordinated on Fe3+-mont are more strongly adsorbed than Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 because of the higher Lewis acid strength of Fe3+-mont. From acetone adsorption IR results, it is shown that Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 are predominantly Lewis acidic toward a weak base acetone, and the Lewis acid strength changes in the order of Fe3+-mont>Yb3+-mont>FeCl3/SiO2. This is in agreement with that obtained using CD3CN as a probe molecule. We have carried out an acetone adsorption microcalorimetric experiment at 323K to obtain more reliable information on Lewis acid strength of Fe3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2. Fig. 8 compares the curves of the differential heat of acetone adsorption on Fe3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2. Li and Shen reported that acetone adsorption on Lewis acid sites on Al2O3, pre-evacuated at 673K, produced initial heats of 115kJmol−1 assignable to acetone adsorption on strong Lewis acid site of Al2O3 [32]. Fe3+-mont showed the initial heat of adsorption of 119kJmol−1 and a gradual drop in the heat. This indicates that Fe3+-mont has strong Lewis acid sites, and Lewis acid sites in Fe3+-mont are not homogeneous in terms of the acid strength, which is in good agreement with the presence of the ν(CO) bands at several wavenumbers for Fe3+-mont (Fig. 7). FeCl3/SiO2 showed lower initial heat of adsorption (95kJmol−1). This indicates that Lewis acid strength of Fe3+-mont is higher than that of FeCl3/SiO2, which is in good agreement with IR experiments for CD3CN and acetone adsorption (Fig. 5). 3.5 Relationship between Lewis acidity and catalytic activity From IR results of pyridine adsorption, it is found that acid sites of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 are predominantly Lewis acidic in nature. The metal cation acts as electron pair accepter and can potentially act as Lewis acid catalyst. This conclusion was supported by IR results for adsorption of CD3CN and acetone. As shown in Table 2, HZSM5, a typical Brønsted acid catalyst, gave a lower yield of acetylation products than Fe3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 (Lewis acids), indicating that Lewis acid site is responsible for the higher activity for acetylation of cyclohexanol. Relative Lewis acid strength of these catalysts is estimated from the stability of adsorbed CD3CN and acetone at elevated temperatures under evacuation (Fig. 5), being found to increase in the order of Fe3+-mont>Yb3+-mont>FeCl3/SiO2. This is further supported by the result of acetone adsorption microcalorimety. Catalytic test of M n+-mont for the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride showed that the activity increased with the charge/radius ratio of exchanged cation (Fig. 3). Taking into account the result that M n+-mont showed low level of leaching (Table 1) and FeCl3·6H2O dissolved in the reaction mixture (homogeneous catalyst) showed low catalytic activity, it is clear that the acetylation activity of M n+-mont catalysts originates from metal cations supported on the clay, and the metal cation with higher Lewis acidity gives higher reaction rates. Although we do not have any proof of the mechanism, we assume that the reaction is initiated by coordination of Ac2O or cyclohexanol to the metal cation (Lewis acid) site. The metal cations with higher Lewis acid strength polarize carbon oxygen bond in the coordinated species, which should result in the higher catalytic activity. For the Lewis acid catalysis of the cation exchanged clay a fundamental question arises: why the activity of metal cations can be enhanced by loading them onto the clay, though the answer is not clarified in the literature. Fe3+-mont was more active than FeCl3/SiO2 and FeCl3·6H2O under the same reaction conditions (Table 2). The higher Lewis acid strength of Fe3+-mont than FeCl3/SiO2, as evidenced by microcalorimetric and IR experiments of acetone adsorption, should be responsible for the higher activity of the former catalyst. On the silicate sheet of clay, the negative charge can be dispersed over many oxygen atoms. The lower partial charge of the clay anion sheet than Cl− ion may lead to higher exchangeability of the Fe3+ cation in the clay and consequently to the higher Lewis acid strength. The catalytic and characterization results in this study demonstrate clear difference between the clay exchanged Lewis acid, Fe3+-mont, and a conventional solid Lewis acid, Al2O3. IR result for CD3CN adsorption on the hydrated Fe3+-mont (Fig. 5) showed that water molecules coordinated to Fe3+ sites were replaced by CD3CN. This implies that the Fe3+ cation on the clay act as Lewis acid site even in the presence of water in the first coordination sphere. On the other hand, Al2O3 partially dehydrated at low temperature (423K) acts as Lewis acid toward strong base, pyridine, but does not act as Lewis acid toward weak base, CD3CN. As shown in Table 2, the acetylation reaction was not catalyzed by Al2O3. From a comparison of these catalytic results with the acidic character, it is proposed that Ac2O or cyclohexanol as a weak base can coordinate to the Fe3+ cation on the hydrated Fe3+-mont, while the weak base cannot compete with stronger base such as OH− and water, which is strongly coordinated to an Al3+ cation on hydrated Al2O3. 4 Conclusion Among 14 types of metal ion-exchanged montmorillonite K-10 clay (M n+-mont), Fe3+-mont is most effective for the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride at room temperature. Fe3+-mont provides a clean and convenient alternative for the acetylation reaction, because the reaction proceeds smoothly in the presence of moisture, producing acetylation products in high yields using the heterogeneous catalyst with reusable and a non-polluting nature that offers easy handling and ready work-up. From the relationship between the activity and the acidic character of Fe3+-mont and reference catalysts, the following conclusion is reached. Lewis acid catalysts are more suitable for acetylation than typical Brønsted acid, HZSM5 zeolite. The order of Lewis acid strength, Fe3+-mont>Yb3+-mont>FeCl3/SiO2, is consistent with the order of catalytic activity, indicating that Lewis acid strength is an important factor affecting the activity. Unlike conventional heterogeneous Lewis acid, Al2O3, the Fe3+ cation in Fe3+-mont act as Lewis acid for weak base, CD3CN, even in the presence of water in the first coordination sphere, which should account for the moisture-tolerant and highly effective Lewis acid catalysis of Fe3+-mont.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic activity of 14 types of metal ion-exchanged montmorillonite K-10 clay (M n+-mont) is tested for the acetylation of cyclohexanol with acetic anhydride at room temperature. The activity increases with an increase in the charge/radius ratio of exchanged cation. The activity of Fe3+-mont is the highest and is higher than those of other Fe3+ catalysts, FeCl3·6H2O and FeCl3/SiO2, conventional acid catalysts, Al2O3 and HZSM5, and homogeneous Lewis acid, Sc(OTf)3. Fe3+-mont exhibits a high turnover numbers (TON=49,500) and can be recycled without a loss in activity. Acidity of Fe3+-mont, Yb3+-mont and FeCl3/SiO2 was characterized by IR spectroscopy using three probe molecules: pyridine, acetonitrile and acetone. These catalysts dominantly act as Lewis acid, and the Lewis acid strength changes in the order of Fe3+-mont>Yb3+-mont>FeCl3/SiO2, as suggested by acetone adsorption microcalorimety. From the relationship between the activity and the acidic character, factors affecting the catalytic activity for the acetylation are discussed.",
