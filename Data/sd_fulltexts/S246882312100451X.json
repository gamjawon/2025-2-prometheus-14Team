The block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]), prepared by this method, acts as a \"nano bridge\" and achieves Ni loading on TiO2 with the help of sol-gel method + thermal reduction. The atomic loading of Ni on TiO2 is achieved through strong covalent bonding, metallic bonding and the natural physical intertwining effect of silane coupling agent. Interestingly, it was unexpectedly found that the TiC stable structure generated by this process, the ionization of part of the block polyelectrolyte after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the loading process of Ni all can promote the formation of oxygen vacancy Ov, which facilitates the charge transfer and hydrogen precipitation reaction. It has superior photocatalytic ability and cheaper cost compared to the conventional impregnation dispersion method. These findings provide a new idea to modify the manipulated photocatalysts by defect engineering to achieve efficient photocatalytic efficiency and capability. 1. Introduction Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is an efficient and versatile method for the synthesis of various block copolymers with high solids content and controlled morphology [1]. Two main relevant pa- rameters, namely block ratio and concentration, have been widely used to tune the morphology of copolymers [2]. In principle, PISA can be performed in any solvent provided that amphiphilic block copolymers can be generated by chain extension of soluble stabilizer blocks, which self-assemble in situ after reaching a critical length of growing nucleated blocks. However, the synthesis of block copolymers by aqueous PISA [3-5], particularly by aqueous dispersion polymerization, is attractive for several reasons: (1) the use of water represents a green chemical process; (2) free radical polymerization typically has a higher polymerization rate [6,7]; and (3) PISA morphology control is easier thermodynamically for aqueous dispersions than for emulsion poly- merization. Although much work has been reported on PISA via aqueous dispersion polymerization, only a few monomers are suitable for the formulations used in aqueous dispersion polymerization. Therefore, there is a great need to expand the library of monomers suitable for aqueous dispersion polymerization to further advance the field of aqueous dispersion polymerization [3,8,9]. Semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted significant attention for their promising applications in addressing global energy and envi- ronmental challenges. Due to the lack of active sites on the surface of semiconductor photocatalysts, co-catalysts are often employed to accelerate the redox reaction of water. Simultaneously reducing the particle size of the co-catalyst is an effective strategy to achieve * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: mnbvcxzxh@163.com (B. Zhang), 1125412583@qq.com (G.

To date, several approaches have emerged to develop photocatalysts, however, most of them are only applicable to noble metals such as Pt and require somewhat harsh reaction conditions and the semiconductors are easily destroyed. For this reason, the syn- thesis of co-catalysts using non-precious metals is highly desirable, but challenging [13,14]. Based on the above challenges, we used inexpensive 3-methacrylox- ypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS, an inexpensive silane coupling agent) as the main monomer for the RAFT reaction, 4-cyano-4-(ethylthiocarbo- nylthio)pentanoic acid as the CTA targeting different degrees of poly- merization (DP), 2-methacryloxypropyltrimethylammonium (providing the model cationic monomer) and hexafluor potassium phosphate (providing model anionic monomers) as RAFT block monomers, monomers suitable for aqueous dispersion must have a delicate balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions, which can be ach- ieved by modular ionic monomers with easily adjustable structures [7, 9]. The polyelectrolytes formed by [META+] and [PF6 âˆ’ ] act as nucle- ating blocks combined with neutral stabilizer blocks by aqueous dispersion polymerization. This combination of neutral block poly- electrolytes with high chemical differences is expected to provide high Flory-Huggins interaction parameters Ï‡, thus facilitating the PISA pro- cess [6]. The block copolymers generated by this method act as a \"bridge\" between the co-catalyst Ni and the photocatalyst TiO2, resulting in a uniform and stable dispersion of Ni on TiO2 through the formation of stable covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds and physical intertwining effects. Fortunately, the strong Ni-O bonds formed effectively prevented the aggregation of Ni atoms and the damage of the TiO2 nanostructure. The obtained photocatalysts exhibit more efficient H2 precipitation ac- tivity compared to Ni-modified TiO2 prepared by conventional impregnation methods. In addition to the atomic Ni co-catalyst, the efficient performance is attributed to both the formation of TiC stable structure by partial Ti and C on the block copolymer during the thermal reduction in the premise of sol-gel method, the ionization of partial block polyelectrolyte after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the loading process of Ni can promote the formation of oxygen vacancy Ov [11,12]. which not only facilitates charge transfer but also hydrogen precipitation reactions. These findings open up new possibilities for the design of efficient and inexpensive photoassisted catalysts. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), 4-cyano-4-(ethyl- thiocarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid (CTA reagent), 2,2â€²-azobis(2- methylpropylmethane) dihydrochloride (V-50, 97%), DMF, azo diiso- butyronitrile (initiator AIBN), [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammo- nium chloride, 2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (80 %wt of aqueous solution) and potassium hexafluorophosphate (99.98%), commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (20~30 nm, anatase), tetra- butyl titanate, anhydrous ethanol, methanol, NaOH, Ni(OH)2 powder, PVP, epichlorohydrin, sodium tripolyphosphate. All reagents were analytically pure and were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Re- agent Group. 4-cyano-4-(ethylthiocarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid was synthesized as previously reported (Shen, W.; Qiu, Q.; Wang, Y.; Miao, M.; Li, B.; Zhang, T.; Cao, A.; An, Z. Macromol. Rapid Commun. 2010, 31, 1444-1448.). MPS was passed through a column of Al2O3 to remove the inhibitor prior to use. AIBN was recrystallized from meth- anol twice. 2.2. Synthesis of PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 â€“ ]) 2.2.1. Synthesis of PMPS PMPS-MPS with DP values of 22 and 31 were synthesized in DMF, and a scheme for the synthesis of PMPS31 was given as follows: MPS (14.9Â±0.1 g, 60.0 mmol) and 4-cyano-4-(ethylthiocarbonothioylthio) pentanoic acid (0.40 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (60.0 mL) and purged with nitrogen at 0â—¦C for 30 min. An appropriate amount of AIBN solution (500uL, containing 24.6 mg of AIBN, 0.15 mmol) was added to the reaction device via a microinjector, followed by the reac- tion at a constant temperature of 70â—¦C for 5 h; then the polymerization reaction was stopped under ice bath conditions [14]. 1H NMR analysis indicated that the monomer conversion was 78%. PMPS was purified via dialysis (MWCO 7kg/mol) against H2O and was isolated via lyophili- zation for one week. PMPS-MPSs were characterized via 1H NMR and GPC.PMPS22:Mn,theory=11.3 kg/mol, Mn,NMR=14.7 kg/mol, Mn, GPC=12.0 kg/mol, Ä�=1.35; PMPS31:Mn,theory=15.7 kg/mol, Mn, NMR=16.7 kg/mol, Mn,GPC=17.6 kg/mol, Ä�=1.20. 1H NMR spectrum and GPC trace of PMPS22 after purification: 1H NMR spectrum and GPC trace of PMPS31 after purification: 2.2.2. Synthesis of block polyelectrolytes [META+][PF6 âˆ’ ] [2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (17.3 g, 83.1 mmol) and potassium hexafluorophosphate (15.3 g, 83.1 mmol) were dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The precipitate was then filtered and washed with cold water. The precipitate was lyophilized under low pressure for 3 days, and the resulting white solid was [META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]. 1H (A), 13C (B) and 19F (C) spectra of [META+][PF6 â€“ ] in DMSO-d6: 2.2.3. Induced assembly of PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) Aqueous dispersion copolymerization of RAFT of [META+][PF6-] was carried out at 80â—¦C with a stirring rate of 500 rpm and a solid content of 5-8% w/v, using PMPS-based macro-CTA at this stage. In a typical experiment, PMPS31 (0.11 g. 0.0070 mmol), followed by 5 mL of deionized water and [META+][PF6 âˆ’ ] (0.067 g, 0.21 mmol), and degassed with N2 in an ice water bath for 30 min. Afterwards, the re- action was transferred to a preheated oil bath at 80â—¦C, and after the temperature stabilization, the V-50 solution (degassed state) was injected through a microinjector, and then the reaction was continued under the protection of N2 for 10 h [15]. The final conversion was close to 80%. Based on the conversion of the monomers, the average degree of polymerization was calculated for each block. Thus the obtained B. Zhang et al.

Zhang et al. RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 4 an atomic distribution of Ni, it is abbreviated as Ni-a/TiO2. we chose commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (20-30 nm, anatase) as the sample for the model photocatalyst, using Ni(OH)2 as precursor of Ni and reacted in the environment of NaOH for a certain time, after which the Na4NiO3 (easily hydrolyzed salt) was obtained by evaporative crystallization. Then, 0.1 g of nano-TiO2, 0.5 g of Na4NiO3 and 0.2 g of dried nano- morphic block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) were dispersed together in 35 mL of alcohol and 1.0 mL of tetrabutyl titanate under vigorous stirring, after which 2.0 mL of ethanol-H2O solution was added dropwise to the mixed solution, then 5.5 mL of PVP solution with a mass concentration of 10.4 g/L as metal protectant [14,17] for 8.0 h. To the obtained sol-gel mixture, epichlorohydrin solution (0.3% of solids) was added and the reaction was continued for 1.0 h. After that, the product was slowly added to sodium tripolyphosphate to form the encapsulated microsphere form. The product was then dried at 80â—¦C for 12 h. After drying, it was washed several times using deionized water and dried again, and thermally reduced at 773 K for 5.0 h. 2.4. synthesis of Ni-n/TiO2 For a better comparison with the present study, the nano-state distributed Ni-n/TiO2 was prepared using the conventional impregna- tion method [18,19,22], where Na4NiO3 and TiO2 were dispersed into 50 mL of ethanol by sonication for 2 h, after which the ethanol was removed by rotary evaporator and the dried product was passed through a 5% N2 stream for a period of time at 573 K. The product was collected and named as Ni-n/TiO2. 2.4. Characterization Methods Morphology was studied by SEM analysis (S-400, Hitachi Corpora- tion, Japan) and HRTEM analysis (Tecnai G2 F20 U, USA). Structural resolution and conformational determination were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy (Bruker AV500). Chemical composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spec- trometer (EDS, S-4800, Hitachi Corporation, Japan). X-ray diffractom- eter (D/MAX-TTR, Japan) was used to analyze the crystal structure. By N2 surface area analyzer (ASAP, USA) at 77K adsorption to determine material surface area and porous properties. Functional groups were analyzed by FTIR spectrometer (EQINOX55, Germany). The chemical state of the materials was observed by X-ray electron spectroscopy (Ultra XPS). Observation of fine structure by X-ray absorption spectrometry (XANES). 2.5. Photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation reaction A 50 mg sample was dispersed in 100 mL of 10 vol% aqueous methanol by sonication under 300 w xenon lamp irradiation, and to eliminate the thermal effect of the xenon lamp, a cooling water circu- lation system was carried out around the reactor during the reaction. The generated gas was taken to GC and analyzed by argon [21]. 2.6. Electrochemical measurement process 20 mg of sample and 20 mg of iodine were dispersed by sonication in 30 mL of anhydrous acetone and the electrophoretic deposition reaction was carried out between FTO films (between FTO and Ti flakes) while applying a bias pressure of 30 V. Afterwards, the sample powder was applied to Ti flakes with an area of about 1 cm2. After drying, the sample was calcined at 573 K for half an hour and cooled naturally under a 5% N2 flow. B. Zhang et al. RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 5 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of RAFT water dispersion polymerization 3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as the main monomer for RAFT dispersion polymerization. The polymerization was carried out in a DMF-containing RAFT solution (free radical initiator V- 50), followed by a secondary water dispersion self-polymerization re- action at 80â—¦C and 5% w/v solids with the participation of block poly- merization of the model cationic monomer [META+] and anionic monomer [PF6 âˆ’ ], and was parameterized by the average degree of polymerization (DP), which was very fast and about 90% conversion was achieved within one hour. A linear kinetic plot of Ln([M]0/[M]) versus time was obtained (Fig. 1A), indicating that a well-controlled RAFT polymerization was achieved [6,7]. Surprisingly, the solution turned turbid within 2.5 min, corresponding to the conversion(3.0%) and the block copolymer composition of PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) at this time, implying that it is a highly asymmetric block copolymer with a small mass fraction of hydrophobic blocks (5.7%). The results indicate that this neutral polyelectrolyte block copolymer has an excellent in situ self-assembly capability. Samples removed during the polymerization process were performed by transmission electron mi- croscopy (TEM), and Fig. 1 (B, C, D) explain the morphological transi- tion from spheres (30% conv.) to short worms (46% conv.) to fused worms (52% conv.) and finally to percolated networks (as in Fig. 2). And relatively long worms (average 246 nm) with uniform diameter (38 nm) were observed at DP=50, further increase in DP would lead to entan- glement and fusion of worms. The morphological transitions observed over monomer conversion during a single polymerization encouraged us to conduct a systematic investigation of PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 â€“]) morphologies by tar- geting various DPs and solids. Subsequently, to demonstrate the applicability of the model ionic monomer method to the generic properties of monomers for aqueous PISA, the polyelectrolyte block 2-[(Acryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammo- nium hexafluorophosphate P([AETA+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) with [AETA+] as the cationic model monomer was prepared, and the anionic model monomer P[META+][BF4 âˆ’ ] with [BF4 âˆ’ ] as the anionic model monomer was also prepared. But their solubility was found to be somewhat different [4] compared to [META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]. The solubility of the block copolymer can be controlled by adjusting the ionic monomers. The RAFT water-dispersion polymerization of both of the above mentioned was found to have a worm phase under the same conditions (as shown in Fig. 3, detailed information can be found in the supporting information S1-S4). 3.2. Morphology and microstructure characterization PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) obtained by RAFT polymerization with Na4NiO3 and TiO2 under sol-gel treatment ensures the Ni- PMPS- MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ])- TiO2 (referred to as Ni-a/ TiO2), where PMPS- MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) acts as a \"nano bridge\"), and its crystal struc- ture, morphology and light trapping properties are basically unchanged. Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. 4(A) that no Ni or NiOx nanoparticles are observed in Ni-a/ TiO2, which indicates that the Ni co-catalyst shows atomic dispersion on TiO2 under the action of PMPS-MPS-P ([META+] [PF6 âˆ’ ]) as a \"nano-bridge\". Meanwhile, the presence of Ni atoms on TiO2 can be seen in the EDS pattern in Fig. 4(B), indicating the presence of highly dispersed [20,22] Ni atoms on the TiO2 surface. The EXAFS spectrum of Fig. 4(C) exhibits the dominant Ni-O coordination (O pro- vided by -OCH3 and C=O on the copolymer PMPS-MPS-P([META+] [PF6 âˆ’ ]), hydrogen capture by -CH3 during the 773 K thermal reduction phase to generate methane, and possible addition reactions and breakage of C=O) with a peak of 2.07 Ã…, while the main peak of NiO particles formed by a small portion of ionized Ni reaches 3.01 Ã…, which belongs to Ni-Ni coordination [13],17]. Therefore, after the sol-gel re- action and after washing and drying, Ni remains on the TiO2 surface due to the strong Ni-O bond and the \"bridge\" - PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) (C and D). Based on the above analysis and conclusion, the Ni co-catalyst on TiO2 prepared by this method, Ni is basically uniformly distributed in atomic form (Ni-a/TiO2). Meanwhile, as a comparison, Ni co-catalysts were also loaded on TiO2 by conventional impregnation method followed by the same thermal reduction treatment [23], marked as Ni-NPs on the figure, as shown in the following Fig. 5A. A distinct nanostate of Ni was also observed in the 5 nm HRTEM image(marked in red circles in Fig. 5.B), which abbreviated as Ni-n/TiO2. The FT-IR spectral results were shown in Fig. 6A. For bare TiO2, the absorption between 500 and 750 cmâˆ’ 1 was the characteristic peak of TiO2, corresponding to Ti-O-Ti bonding, Ti-O bending and Ti-O stretching. For Ni-a/TiO2, PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]), which was the \"intermediate bridge\", the peaks at 3442 cmâˆ’ 1, 2927 cmâˆ’ 1, 1635 cmâˆ’ 1, 1549 cmâˆ’ 1, 1319 cmâˆ’ 1 and the peaks at 1070 cmâˆ’ 1 were desig- nated as O-H, C-H stretching vibration [23â€“25], acyloxy band I, acyloxy band II, C-H (mixed), and C-O-C. Two small peaks appeared at 1000-1250 cmâˆ’ 1, which was the absorption characteristic peaks of Ti-C. Meanwhile, compared with the characteristic peaks of TiO2, the in- tensity of the peaks on Ni-a/TiO2 is partially changed, which was attributed to the stable structure of TiC formed by Ti and C on C-Si (or other sources of carbon on PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ])) due to the thermal reduction treatment after the sol-gel method, and the other small part of Ti forms Ti-Ti bonds or interacts with some groups. These were not observed in Ni-n/TiO2, further indicating that the atomic form of Ni-a/TiO2 formed by RAFT copolymerization had a more stable [17] morphological structure compared to the nano-state Ni-n/TiO2 formed by the conventional impregnation method. Fig. 6B shows that they exhibit superparamagnetic behavior with magnetization saturation values of 2.21 and 0.66 emÎ¼gâˆ’ 1, respectively. Ensuring the structural integrity of the semiconductor is a prerequisite in the loading of Ni co-catalysts on TiO2. From Fig. 6C, it can be learned that the semi- conductor structure will change from anatase to rutile when the thermal reduction process exceeds 773 K. Therefore, the temperature should be controlled below 773 K [15,16]. At this temperature, the crystal struc- ture and light absorption properties will not be affected. the binding energy of 854.63 eV indicates that the Ni atom in Ni-TiO2 was in the Ni2+ state [25,28] (Fig. 6D), and after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K, the binding energy was transferred to 854.13 eV (Ni-a/TiO2), which was still higher than the NiO state, and this result agreed with the XANES results. As shown in Fig. 7. the XPS pattern, Ti, O, C, and N peaks can be observed at the binding energies of Ti 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and N 1s. The high- resolution Ti 2p region can be decomposed into two peaks (Fig. 7B) with Fig. 1. Kinetic results (A) and TEM micrographs (B-D) of the RAFT polymeri- zation process using PMPS31 and P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) at 80â—¦C, 5% w/v solids and molar ratio [PMPS31]/[monomer]/[V-50] = 1:100:0.1. B. Zhang et al. RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 6 binding energies of 458.9 eV (Ti2p 3/2) and 464.6 eV (Ti2p 1/2), respectively, indicating the existence of other morphologies besides the TiO2 morphology, which may be the TiC structure formed [26,27] during the 773 K thermal reduction process, as well as a small peak, which may be the TiCxOy generated at the same stage. Fig. 7C showed the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s with three peaks at 284.8, 286.4 Fig. 2.

RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 7 and 288.2 eV, indicating the existence of three different carbon chemical environments. The binding energy of 284.8 eV is probably the C-O/C=O bond, which was derived from the polyelectrolyte block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) generated by RAFT water dispersion polymerization, and the binding energies of 286.4 eV and 288.2 eV correspond to the C-H and CO-Ti bonds, respectively, with the inter- section of a small deconvolution peak, confirming the formation of TiC [16,19,22,24]. As shown in Fig. 7D, the high-resolution O 1s spectra showed two peaks at 530.3eV and 532.0eV, corresponding to the strong Ti-O bond and the oxygen species adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy (used to balance the oxygen vacancy Ov), respectively. The strong peak at 532.0eV implies that the amount of Ov is very enormous and contributes to the photocatalytic activity, and considering the low content of Ni, the oxygen vacancy Ov here should be mainly from the TiO2. The oxygen vacancy defect equation O=1/2O2+Vo [21,28] shows that the ionization of part of the block polyelectrolyte P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K also participates in the for- mation of part of the Ov. The main source of N 1s corresponds to the N-H bond in the block model cation [META+], which also stabilizes the the structure of semiconductor TiO2 (the spectrum of N 1s is not shown here). To further confirm the TiC structure formed by partial Ti with C on the block copolymer during the thermal reduction in the premise of sol- gel method, a search by high magnification SEM electron microscopy was performed. The generated TiC branches can be clearly seen in Fig. 8A to consist of a two-dimensional layered structure that can pro- vide a very large number of active sites [21,29], implying that the photocatalytic efficiency can be further enhanced. The cross-sectional image in Fig. 8B further demonstrates the three-dimensional structure of the interconnected branch, which is composed of two-dimensional Fig. 5.

B. Zhang et al. RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 8 TiC nanosheets (Fig. 8C), and Ti and C are in a uniformly dispersed state (Fig. 8D). The Ti2p core-level spectrum in Fig. 8E shows that the pre- pared Ni-a/TiO2 has essentially the same energy spectrum morphology compared to the standard-grade TiC nanosheets, with the characteristic peaks of the Ti-C bonds slightly shifted toward higher binding energies, which may be related to the formation of covalent bonds and the \"nano-bridge\" polyelectrolyte block P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) electronic in- teractions. A similar situation is observed in the C1s mapping (Fig. 8F). This facilitates the formation of more oxygen vacancies Ov on the TiO2 surface [29,30] [31], which plays a role in the photocatalytic efficiency [32,33]. As can be seen from the TOF-SIMS ion spectra at the top of Fig. 9, the ionic fragments of (NiO)2Si+ and (NiO)(TiO)2 Si+ form intensity peaks at mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 178 and 231, respectively, from the pos- itive spectrum of Ni-a/TiO2, indicating that the strong Ni-O bond plays a large role [30,37] in the loading linkage of Ni and TiO2. Among them, the organic part of PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6âˆ’ ]) is also detected at m/z=58 and m/z=85 in the negative spectra. A weak peak of O-Si-O-- Si-O- was also detected at m/z=104, representing a slight condensation of the siloxane fraction. These findings suggest that the thermal reduc- tion process at 773 K did cause ionization and other reactions in the \"nano-bridges\", and these phenomena could cause some of the oxygen on the TiO2 and \"nano-bridges\" to break away [32] from their original or- bits, thus creating more oxygen vacancies Ov. As can be seen from the bottom left half of Fig. 9 (AC and BD), the surface area and pore volume of bare TiO2 do not change much compared to the prepared Ni-a/TiO2, indicating the existence of stable textural properties[22,23] of the semiconductor TiO2 during the preparation process, which is important for the photocatalytic ability. The EDS spectra of Ni-a/TiO2 was shown in Fig. 9 (E~I), which shows the presence of these elements in the synthesized Ni-a/TiO2, while (H) shows the presence of various color elements such as C, H, O, and Si between Ni and TiO2 (some elements are shown in Fig.S5), confirming the existence and role of the \"nano-bridge \"PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) is present and active. 3.3. Hydrogen evolution reaction performance and mechanism During the study, the final synthesized Ni- PMPS-MPS-P([META+] [PF6 âˆ’ ])- TiO2 (Ni-a/TiO2) photocatalyst exhibited excellent H2 precip- itation activity, reflecting the excellent catalytic ability of the atomic Ni co-catalyst. And Ni-a/TiO2 exhibited the highest H2 precipitation rate at a thermal reduction temperature of 773 K (Fig. 10 A). In addition, the phase change of TiO2 occurs above 773 K. As shown in Fig. 10B, increasing the loading of nickel from 0.25 wt.% to 0.46 wt.% increases the H2 precipitation rate. Continuing to increase the loading leads to a significant decrease in activity, which may be related to the near satu- ration of the surface active site [34]. As shown in Fig. 10C, no significant photocatalyst deactivation was observed during successive H2 precipi- tation [38], and no change in the aggregation state or chemical state of the Ni atoms was observed, indicating the excellent durability of the atomic Ni-a/TiO2 connected by the block copolymer synthesized by RAFT as a bridge. In Fig. 10D, the Ni- PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ])- TiO2 (Ni-a/TiO2) prepared in this study has superior photocatalytic ability compared with the nano-state Ni-n/TiO2 and Pt-TiO2 photo- catalysts prepared by the conventional method [33]. As shown in Fig. 11 A and B, no change in the aggregated state or chemical state of Ni atoms was observed before and after the reaction, indicating the excellent durability of the Ni-a/TiO2 photocatalyst. Ov can significantly increase the electrical conductivity of the metal oxide semiconductor and act as the active site [35] for the catalytic reaction, thus improving the photocatalytic performance. The slopes of the Mott Schottky (MS) curves in Fig. 11C are 5.01 and 1.02, corresponding to the electron density ratios of TiO2 and Ni-a/TiO2, respectively. The high electron density not only promotes the dissociation process, but also facilitates the diffusion of charge carriers, both of which can promote the photocatalytic activity. In Fig. 11D, we investigated the ability of Ni-a/TiO2 to catalyze HER [34,35]. The free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Î”G^) [39]was calculated and the ideal value should be close to 0 volts. Moreover, it seems that Ov was involved in the HER process, probably because H prefers to interact with Ni and also with the adjacent Ov. Therefore, the optimal Ov value plays an important role in maxi- mizing the photocatalytic activity. From the previous, it is known that Fig. 7. (A) High-resolution XPS patterns of Ti 2p, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s of Ni-a/TiO2, (B) Ti 2p (C) C 1s (D) O 1s. B. Zhang et al. RETRACTED Molecular Catalysis 513 (2021) 111834 9 Ni-a/TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic efficiency [38] when the Ni loading is 0.46 wt%, which is the optimal Ov value at this time. In other words, the Ni co-catalyst and Ov play a synergistic role in the photo- catalytic property of Ni-a/TiO2. From the fitted Cdl curves shown in Fig. 12A, it can be seen that the electrochemical double-layer capacitance Cdl of Ni-a/TiO2 is 1.772 mF/ cm2, which is higher than that of Ni-n/TiO2 prepared by the conven- tional method [36,37] (0.528 mF/cm2), indicating that the Ni-a/TiO2 prepared in this study has a larger electrochemically active surface area, which in turn can further increase the HER performance (actually stimulating more Ov to participate in HER). In addition, the TiC formed by Ni-a/TiO2 under thermal reduction conditions has excellent electrical conductivity and promotes continuous electron transfer between the electrode and water molecules. As shown in the stability test and chro- noamperometry curve of Ni-a/TiO2 in Fig. 12B, the lost current density is negligible after 10,000 cycles in the range of -0.21v~0.11v, indicating that Ni-n/TiO2 has good stability. During the photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation reaction, the onset potential and current of Na-a/TiO2 are higher than those of bare TiO2, confirming the excellent ability [28] of Ni-a/TiO2 in participating in the photocatalytic process (Fig. 12C). Accordingly, we speculate that Ov is more likely to be formed stably when Ni-a/TiO2 is used as a photocatalyst. For this purpose, further density flooding theory (DFT) calculations were performed and it was found that the Ov formation energy on bare TiO2 was 5.46 eV, while that on Ni-a/TiO2 was 4.0 eV (as shown in the molecular model in Fig. 12D). The results are in agreement with our speculation that the presence of highly dispersed co-catalyst Ni on TiO2 with the help of \"nano-bridges\" PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ]) can significantly reduce the Ov forma- tion energy, whcih also explains the formation of Ov [33] on Ni-a/TiO2 rather than on bare TiO2 during the sol-gel method + thermal reduction treatment and the fact that the concentration of Ov can be increased within a certain range by increasing the Ni content. 4. Conclusion In summary, a modular approach using ionic monomers was devel- oped and enabled easy adjustment of monomer/polymer solubility, which is expected to facilitate the identification of monomers suitable for formation by aqueous dispersion polymerization. By this method, \"nano-bridge\"â€”PMPS-MPS-P([META+][PF6 â€“]) with block poly- electrolytes were synthesized. The Ni co-catalyst (Ni- PMPS-MPS-P ([META+][PF6 âˆ’ ])-TiO2) distributed in atomic form was obtained by sol- gel method + thermal reduction treatment, and the stable distribution of Ni on TiO2 was achieved by strong covalent bonding, metallic bonding and the natural physical intertwining effect of silane coupling agent, etc. Interestingly, it was unexpectedly found that the TiC stable structure generated by this process, the ionization of partially blocked poly- electrolytes after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the Fig. 8.

The H2 precipitation efficiency of the prepared composites is better than that of Ni-n/TiO2 prepared by the conventional method, which has a cheap advantage over the noble metal photocatalyst Pt/TiO2. These findings provide a new idea to modify manipulated photocatalysts by defect engineering to achieve efficient photocatalytic efficiency and capability.
