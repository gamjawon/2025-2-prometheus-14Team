Prasad, N.V. Thakkar* Inorganic Chemistry Division, The Institute of Science, Bombay 400032, India Received 30 November 1993; accepted 3 March 1994 Abstract The role of cobalt(II) and its complexes with 1-phenyl 1-hydrazonyl 2-oximinopropanedione (HPHOPD) as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has been investigated by measuring evolution of oxygen at different time intervals in the temperature range 35-60 C. Enhanced activity is observed with Co(PHOPD)2 used as heterogeneous catalyst and with cobalt: HPHOPD (1:1) complex heterogenized by adsorption on alumina, while in case of solutions of cobalt(II) chloride and cobalt: HPHOPD (1:1), used as homogeneous catalysts, the activity is comparatively low and negligible respectively. The reaction rate, in general, is found to increase with increase in temperature and quantity of the catalyst. Various thermodynamic parameters have been calculated. The adduct formation with a heterocyclic base like pyridine, 3-methyl pyridine, chloro pyridine or quinoline is found to inhibit the catalytic activity of Co(PHOPD)2. The probable reaction mechanisms have been suggested for Co(PHOPD)2 and alumina-Con-HPHOPD as catalysts. Key words: Cobalt; Decomposition; Hydrogen peroxide 1. Introduction In recent years, there have been reports that many complexes of transition metals are more effective catalysts than their aquo metal ions in catalysing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [ 1 ] . The heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts is an area of intense current interest. When complexes are affixed to various supports [ 2-5 ] , enhanced catalytic activity has been observed; these complexes are found to be mainly of neutral ligands. Our literature survey reveals that complexes of anionic ligands have not been studied at length. This paper reports a sequential *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thakkar/Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 9-20 study of various catalytic forms, i.e., homogeneous catalyst, heterogenized homogeneous catalyst and heterogeneous catalyst using cobalt(II) and its complexes with a monoanionic bidentate ligand, 1-phenyl 1-hydrazonyl 2-oximinopropanedione (HPHOPD). The heterogeneous Co (PHOPD) 2 is neutral. The present work thus deals with the study of solutions of Co\" chloride and cobalt: HPHOPD ( l : l ) as homogeneous catalysts, Co (PHOPD) 2 as heterogeneous catalyst and cobalt: HPHOPD (1 :1) heterogenized on alumina support in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The effect on the catalytic properties of Co (PHOPD)2 on adduct formation with heterocyclic bases such as pyridine (Py), 3-methyl pyridine (3-Me-Py), chloropyridine (CI-Py) or quinoline (Q) has also been studied. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials All the chemicals used were of analytical grade. HPHOPD was prepared by the reported procedure [ 6 ] . 2.2. Preparation of the catalyst A solution of cobalt (II)-HPHOPD was prepared by mixing equimolar (0.1 M) quantities of cobalt nitrate (20 ml) in water and HPHOPD (20 ml) in alcohol. A weighed quantity (5 g) of alumina, processed for the purpose [ 7 ] , was kept in contact with a measured volume (40 ml) of the above solution in a glass stoppered bottle at room temperature for 24 h with intermittent shaking. It was finally filtered, washed with distilled water and alcohol for complete removal of the adhering complex and dried at 100 C for about 2 h. The concentration of cobalt in the heterogenized catalyst was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer using a cobalt hollow cathode lamp. The complex Co (PHOPD) 2 was prepared by the reported procedure [ 6 ] . The adducts of Co (PHOPD)2 with Py, 3-Me-Py, CI-Py and Q were prepared by dissolving Co(PHOPD)2 in a minimum quantity of the base (Py/3-Me-Py/ClPy/Q) and evaporating the solution at room temperature. The solid obtained on evaporation was dried at 100 C. The desired concentration of hydrogen peroxide was obtained by successive dilution from the stock solution which was standardized by titration against a standard KMn04 solution [ 8 ] from time to time. 2.3. Kinetic measurements A weighed quantity of the catalyst was shaken with 10.0 ml hydrogen peroxide (5 vol.) in a closed reaction vessel kept in a thermostated water bath and the volume R.V.

Experiments were carried out at three different temperatures in the range 35-60 C. The effect of varying the amount of catalyst used was studied at a constant concentration of hydrogen peroxide at 55 C. The specific reaction rates k were evaluated from the plot of log (a-x) against time t, (Fig. 1), where a and x are the volumes of oxygen evolved after completion of decomposition and at any time t respectively. The activation energy, E, was calculated from the Arrhenius plots. The changes in entropy of activation, 4S#, enthalpy of activation, 4H#, and free energy of activation, 4G # , have also been calculated (Table 1) . 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Cobalt(11) chloride as homogeneous catalyst and Co(PHOPD)2 as heterogeneous catalyst The results of the present study indicate that cobalt(II) ion in the form of its chloride solution shows a very low catalytic activity with respect to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. However in the presence of Co(PHOPD)z in the heterogeneous phase, the catalytic disproportionation is enhanced considerably, as is easily inferred from Fig. 1. It follows that complexation and heterogenisation of Co\" has an enhanced effect on the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, especially at higher temperatures. This inference is consistent with the specific reaction rates observed at three different temperatures (Table 1) . It is observed that under identical experimental conditions, the rate of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition is determined by the nature of the complex. The order of reaction with respect to the amount of the catalyst was determined from the slope of the linear plots of log k against log [amount of catalyst] as seen in Fig. 2, and were found to be 0.256 for COC12 and 1.04 for Co(PHOPD)2. In the case of Co', chloride in homogeneous medium, a small amount of Co\" ions is initially oxidized to Co3+ ions, which may be responsible for the radical generation and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, as thoroughly explained by Baxendale [10]. The complex Co (PHOPD)2 [I] is suggested to have an octahedral geometry on the basis of magnetic and spectral properties [ 6 ] , the 5th and 6th coordination sites being satisfied by linkage to -NHZ groups of the ligand moieties from the neighbouring molecules. As the complex is high-spin, it has two electrons in the eg orbitals and hence the USE is not very high. The reaction is therefore expected to be relatively faster. It may be noted that the Co I\" complex of isonitrosoacetophenone [ 11 ] , Co (INAP) 3, known to be a low-spin octahedral complex with very high LFSE, does not show any catalytic activity with respect to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

However, in the case of Co (PHOPD)2, the results depicted in Table 1 indicate that higher k values are found associated with higher E values. This suggests that the reaction rate is governed by the entropy of activation [ 12 ] . It has also been stated [ 13 ] that when a system passes into a transition state, accompanied by a great increase in entropy, then not withstanding the great activation energy, the reaction will proceed at a high rate. 14 R. V Prasad 1~! V. Thakkar /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 92 (1994) 9-20 The large positive enthalpies and entropies of activation are highly suggestive of an Id activation mode [ 14 ] , also supported by high activation energies [ 14 ] . Further, for Co (PHOPD) 2, ad ' system in a weak octahedral ligand field, the change in activation energy, dEa, in forming an intermediate is only -1.14. Thus, there is not much loss of USE in the formation of the intermediate, implying a fast reaction rate by that particular path. The studies carried out with adducts of Co(PHOPD)2 with heterocyclic bases like pyridine, 3-methyl pyridine, chloropyridine and quinoline, used as heterogeneous catalysts in the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, revealed that the otherwise very active Co (PHOPD) 2 showed no activity at all. Thus the adduct formation totally inhibits the catalytic activity of Co(PHOPD)2.

On the basis of above observations, a mechanism proposed for the decomposition of H202 catalysed by Co (PHOPD) 2 is depicted in Scheme 1. 3.2. Cobalt: HPHOPD (1:1) complexes as catalysts In a series of experiments where decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was studied using Co\": HPHOPD (1:1) solution in homogeneous medium the catalytic effect was observed to be very poor. This is evident from the fact that when 10 ml of CoII : HPHOPD (1:1) solution (0.1 M) was kept in contact with 10 ml (- 5 vol) hydrogen peroxide at 55 C, the volume of oxygen was found to be only 0.2 ml in 7 min. On the other hand it was 11.7 ml in 7 min when 0.5 g of the catalyst (CoI'HPHOPD: 4.5 X 10-3 g) was used under similar conditions. In contrast, on heterogenization of the catalyst, i.e., with Co\": HPHOPD (1:1) adsorbed on alumina, much higher catalytic activity is observed.

Plot of 1/k against 1/[Co(PHOPD)Z]. log (a-x) against time (Fig. 3) is a straight line indicating that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the catalyst proceeds in a first order manner. Keeping the quantity of catalyst constant (0.5 g containing Cot'-HPHOPD: 4.5 X 10-3 g), the concentration of hydrogen peroxide also being constant (5 vol), when the temperature is varied in the range 35-60 C, the value of k is found to increase ((0.6 to 4.8) X 10- 2 min -') with increase in temperature (Table 2) . The plot of log k against log (Cots-HPHOPD) shows a linear trend (Fig. 4) with a slope of 1.2, indicating that the order of the disproportion reaction with respect to quantity of catalyst is almost unity. The energy of activation calculated from the Arrhenius plot in the temperature range 35-60 C is found to be 72.35 kJ/mol, (Table 2). It is known [ 15 ] that alumina duly processed [ 7 ] acts as a catalyst in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. When experiments were carried out with alumina under identical conditions, the volume of oxygen evolved was found to be negligible. Experiments carried out using alumina, treated with a solution of HPHOPD, revealed almost no activity at all. This shows that both the CottHPHOPD in solution and alumina have little or no activity in the decomposition of 18 R. V Prasad, N.

However, activity increases considerably when the complex is formed on the surface of alumina through the interaction of hydrogen peroxide and CO-HPHOPD which is responsible for the fast H202 decomposition reaction. The plot of k -' against [ Co (PHOPD) 2 ] -' ( Fig. 5 ) and similarly plot of k -' against [Co\"-HPHOPD (adsorbed on alumina) ] -' (Fig. 6) passing through the origin with a sharp break in linearity is indicative of the formation of an intermediate complex involving catalyst-H202 species [ 16]; at a certain concentration of the intermediate complex, the rate of the reaction increases sharply. This is observed in the case of Co (PHOPD)2 and alumina-Co\"-HPHOPD, but it is not observed in case of cobalt chloride. This is further supported by the fact that the colour of the surface adsorbed complex was observed to change from light green to a very light brown, the moment it came into contact with hydrogen peroxide. The colour persists as long as any residual hydrogen peroxide remains undecomposed. On the other hand, either when CO-HPHOPD solution is used as a homogeneous catalyst or when alumina is used as a heterogeneous catalyst, no colour change is observed. This is further indicative of the formation of the active complex. R. V. Prasad N.V.

They found that in the first step, H202 is coordinated with the catalyst and in the next step it is deprotonated. Thus, from the above observations the rate law for Co (PHOPD)2 and alumina Coll-HPHOPD may be written as d[OZ] /dt=k[catalyst] [H202]2 (4) Since the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is in large excess compared to the quantity of Coll-HPHOPD present on the surface, it may be considered to be constant [ 19 ] . Thus Eq. 4 may be reduced to: d[02] /dt=k[catalyst] (5) From Eq. 5, one could infer that the decomposition process would be affected by variation in the quantity of catalyst present on the surface. This is in agreement with the experimental results; an increasing k value has been observed on increasing the quantity of the catalyst in the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide.

Thakkar ∗ Inorganic Chemistry Division, The Institute of Science, Bombay 400032, India * Corresponding author The role of cobalt(II) and its complexes with 1-phenyl 1-hydrazonyl 2-oximinopropanedione (HPHOPD) as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide has been investigated by measuring evolution of oxygen at different time intervals in the temperature range 35–60°C. Enhanced activity is observed with Co(PHOPD)2 used as heterogeneous catalyst and with cobalt:HPHOPD (1:1) complex heterogenized by adsorption on alumina, while in case of solutions of cobalt(II) chloride and cobalt:HPHOPD (1:1), used as homogeneous catalysts, the activity is comparatively low and negligible respectively. The reaction rate, in general, is found to increase with increase in temperature and quantity of the catalyst. Various thermodynamic parameters have been calculated. The adduct formation with a heterocyclic base like pyridine, 3-methyl pyridine, chloro pyridine or quinoline is found to inhibit the catalytic activity of Co(PHOPD)2. The probable reaction mechanisms have been suggested for Co(PHOPD)2 and alumina-CoII-HPHOPD as catalysts. Keywords Cobalt Decomposition Hydrogen peroxide References [1] N. Gupta P.C. Nigam Ind. J.
