Graphical abstract Confinement of clathrate hydrate enables an energy efficient, cyclic and carbon neutral storage concept in which CO2, generated by E-methane conversion, replaces E-methane by direct exchange. Keywords Long duration energy storage Green methane Carbon neutrality Confined clathrate hydrates CH4/CO2 exchange Direct gas exchange 1 Challenges circular methane energy systems In recent decades, methane-based energy systems have rapidly gained traction across the globe because of the increasing availability of low-cost methane production capacity. However, fossil methane production and combustion lead to large greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change [1]. In future energy systems, fossil energy production will be replaced by an increasing amount of renewable electricity. Given the intermittency of renewable power generation, chemical energy can play an important role as a reliable source of dispatchable power. Owing to their high energy density and low self-discharge, molecules such as H2 and CH4 can be used for long duration energy storage (LDES), complementary to shorter duration storage technologies such as electrochemical batteries [2,3]. As a result, circular methane-based power-to-gas applications have been proposed frequently in the configuration of future zero emission energy systems [4,5]. An important drawback of circular carbon-based energy applications is the need for expensive infrastructure for the handling of CO2. Especially carbon capture and gas storage escalate project costs. For stationary storage of CH4 and CO2, underground gas storage in empty gas fields, aquifers or salt caverns can be a low-cost option for the longer term storage of gasses at grid-scale [3]. However, for smaller decentralized applications, storage needs to be done in expensive storage tanks. To date, CH4 and CO2 storage relies on compression and liquefaction. Drawbacks of compression are the stringent safety regulations and the expensive pressure vessels. Storage tank costs are dominated by material costs and are proportional to operating pressures. Liquefaction faces high cost associated with the liquefaction process step and gas losses through boil-off [6]. Adsorbent materials can be used to lower the operating pressure, but increase materials cost. Many adsorbent materials have been proposed for storing CH4 and CO2, including zeolites, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) [6], carbon fibers and nanotubes, and activated carbon [7,8]. A common problem with gas storage through adsorption is related to heat management. During filling of a tank, heat released through exothermic adsorption raises the bed temperature, thereby lowering storage capacity. Conversely, during the gas delivery from the vessel, the endothermic nature of desorption lowers bed temperature, which can dramatically impact working capacities and gas release kinetics [7,9]. Heat input is thus often required to release the stored gas from the adsorbed state at relevant discharge rates [7]. This not only decreases the energy efficiency, the need for heating infrastructure also limits flexible deployment. One way to cope with this problem is to thermally couple CO2 adsorption and CH4 desorption. This can be done by heat exchange between the CO2 and CH4 storage vessels. In this perspective, we want to propose an innovative adsorption-based storage concept, integrating CH4 and CO2 storage in the same storage vessel. First we discuss the origin of the concept and the foreseen challenges. As a stepping stone towards practical implementation of the concept, we provide initial experimental proof-of-concept. Next we explain our view on the concept’s application potential, supported by a first modelling effort. 2 CO2 for CH4 exchange in clathrate adsorbent Here we propose a convenient adsorption-driven gas storage concept for decentralized use, employing the same adsorbent bed for both CO2 and CH4. Compared to CH4, CO2 is generally more strongly adsorbed because of its stronger van der Waals interactions with the adsorbent, and its quadrupole moment generating attractive forces towards polar adsorbents surfaces [10]. CO2 entering a CH4-saturated adsorption column will favorably compete for the adsorption sites causing an exchange of CH4 by CO2. As CO2 interacts more strongly with the adsorbent, the adsorption enthalpy can be used to desorb neighboring CH4 molecules. While conceptually attractive, the right choice of adsorbent for this concept is critical. In order to design a predictable and controlled process, adsorption enthalpies must be consistent when progressively exchanging gases, while CH4 and CO2 adsorption enthalpies cannot be excessively different. A crystalline adsorbent could possess such characteristics. Being a crystalline structure known for storing CH4 and CO2, clathrate hydrates could be a suitable candidate for the exchange concept. Clathrate hydrates, also referred to as gas hydrates, are ice-like structures with molecular cages in which molecules like CO2 and CH4 are encapsulated in individual water cages [11]. Gas hydrates encapsulating CH4 occur naturally in permafrost and below the seafloor [12]. Interestingly, CO2 injection in this natural methane ice has been proposed to recover fossil CH4 gas. Vast bodies of theoretical and experimental research concerning the exchange of CH4 by CO2 in natural conditions exist in literature. CH4 recovery from natural hydrates has been tested and confirmed in laboratory experiments, as well as field experiments [13–15]. Challenges remain for commercial implementation, but lab-scale experiments for CO2/CH4 exchange in gas hydrate systems have shown recovery of up to 90% of initially present CH4. Some of the problems encountered in experiments mimicking natural hydrate exploitation were mass transfer problems, slowing down the progress of the replacement reaction. Following contact between CO2 and CH4 hydrate, quick replacement of the outer shell is found, after which further transport of CO2 and CH4 into the clathrate particles is limited by diffusion through the CO2 hydrate shell [16–18]. Overall, most challenges are related to poor permeability of the hydrate system, low CO2/hydrate interphase area or intermixing of CO2/CH4 gas phases. Applying the exchange concept in a controlled process environment, rather than at fixed natural conditions, presents opportunities to optimize the concept outside of natural bounds and convert it into a viable above-ground storage application. In order to be useful in such a storage concept, clathrate formation must be fast and predictable. However, as CH4 hydrate formation in natural sediments can take multiple days to complete, alternative promotors are needed. The introduction of tailor-made synthetic porous materials, called “nanoreactors”, is a known method to alleviate formation conditions and kinetics [19–21]. By optimizing pore structure and surface chemistry, the hydrate nucleation process can be promoted. The introduction of pore volume catalyzes hydrate formation by providing more gas/liquid interphase and the internal surface chemistry can act as a template for hydrate nucleation [19]. Mesoporous materials with moderate hydrophobicity typically show optimal performance as they comprise suitable pore dimensions for hydrate growth and provide a good balance between surface/water interaction, while still allowing sufficient internal water hydrogen bonding [19]. Beckwée et al. showed that when CH4 hydrates are formed in periodic mesoporous organosilica materials (PMO), hydrates are formed within minutes at 2 MPa and 273 K [22]. Additionally, with a void fraction of up to 95%, the presence of hollow ring PMO promoter material has very low impact on storage capacity of the hydrate (Table S2). The permeability of the system can be significantly increased through the presence of gas channels between hydrate formations [22], while at the same time increasing the gas/hydrate interphase. Additionally, when a storage tank can be operated at conditions where CO2 is at least partially liquefied, through buoyancy effects, one can avoid excessive CO2 dilution of the gaseous CH4 product [12]. Expanding the existing research of gas exchange in natural hydrates to a new energy-efficient storage technology thus seems very appealing. Concerning the coupling of adsorption and desorption enthalpy of both gases, strong indications exist that this indeed happens in natural hydrate systems under certain conditions. Although, to date, no consensus exists about the exact hydrate molecular exchange mechanism, Mu et al. confirmed the absence of considerable endo- or exothermic phenomena and existence of unstructured water during the exchange [23]. Additionally, a recent study revealed that by stabilizing CH4 clathrate in a porous matrix, filling and emptying can be achieved without melting and recrystallizing the clathrate [24]. That is, clathrate hydrates structures can load and unload gases without the need for complete reformation and breakdown of the structure. This suggests that the exchange process can take place without active heat management. To the best of our knowledge, Casco et al. have performed the only research using nanoconfined clathrates in a circular power-to-methane concept [25] . In their experimental work, CH4 hydrate was formed inside the nanopores of activated carbon at 275 K and 5 MPa. CH4 pressure was then lowered to 0.1 MPa while simultaneously cooling down the system to 203 K. Upon exposure to 0.2 MPa of CO2 gas, no changes occurred. Subsequently heating the system to 229 K induced a minute-fast breakdown of the clathrate, followed by conversion of the resulting stacking disordered ice Isd or hexagonal ice Ih into CO2 clathrate hydrate. While no direct exchange was achieved under the conditions evaluated by Casco et al. (203–269 K and 0.1–1.5 MPa CO2 pressure), the work highlighted that nanoconfinement of gas hydrates could lead to interesting applications in gas storage and transport [25]. Stabilization of the CH4 hydrate phase at higher temperature and lower pressure could indeed pave the way for interesting applications. Beckwée et al. recently reported on the application of a new type of periodic mesoporous organosilica nanotubes, coined HR-PMO, as host material promoting methane hydrate stabilization. Even at high water loadings, i.e., > 5 g water/ g material, HR-PMO was capable of stabilizing CH4 hydrate up to 273 K at 3.5 MPa [22]. In such conditions, direct exchange of CH4 clathrate into CO2 clathrate could become possible, opening up new experimental windows of opportunity for high temperature and high pressure CO2 exchange. 3 Proof of concept To validate the feasibility of this concept, an exploratory direct exchange experiment was performed using in-situ static 13C NMR spectroscopy to monitor the system. In the experiment, HR-PMO supported CH4 hydrate was synthesized according to the protocol described by Beckwée et al. [22]. In short, the HR-PMO was first hydrated with ultra-pure water (milli-Q) to a loading of 5.5 g water/g HR-PMO. Approximately 300 mg of this hydrated material was then packed in a custom 5 mm high-pressure NMR cell, built according to the design of Houlleberghs et al. [26]. Subsequently, the cell was pressurized with 13C-enriched CH4 gas (99% 13C) to 7 MPa and transferred to the NMR spectrometer where the system was monitored in-situ with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy while equilibrating it for 12 h at 273 K. Following this initial equilibration and while still monitoring the system using NMR, the CH4 gas pressure was reduced to 0.5 MPa. Keeping the system isothermal at 273 K, the pressure was subsequently raised to 3.5 MPa using 13C-enriched CO2 (∼50% 13C) and the evolution of the system was followed as function of time using in-situ quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 1 summarizes the evolution of the 13C NMR spectra and their components (color coded) throughout the different steps of the procedure. Before exposure to CO2 gas (blue spectrum), the system exclusively contains confined sI CH4 clathrate hydrate (green resonance) and gaseous CH4 (pink resonance) [24]. Exposure of CH4 hydrate to CO2 gas at 3.5 MPa (time = 0) results in the immediate appearance of an additional 13C NMR signal at 127.82 ppm (orange resonance), associated with gaseous CO2. Already after 1 h, a broad feature emerges centered around 127.94 ppm (black resonance), displaying a Pake-like axial pattern. This resonance is assigned to the presence of CO2 molecules in the large (51262) oblate cages of sI clathrate hydrates [27,28]. At the same time, a more narrow signal appears at 128.15 ppm (cyan resonance), corresponding to CO2 in the small (512) quasi-spherical cavities [27]. Interestingly, the temporal decrease in signal intensity assigned to enclathrated CH4 (green spheres) is paralleled by a simultaneous increase of the 13C NMR signal associated with CO2 in the large cages (black dots) of sI, hinting at the direct exchange of CH4 for CO2, rather than a clathrate decomposition-recrystallization mechanism. The left pane in Fig. 1 depicts the evolution of area of all resonances as function of time. The 13C signal of CO2 molecules in small clathrate cages (cyan spheres) slightly decreases over time, in agreement with previous literature reports documenting a marked affinity of CO2 molecules for the larger 51262 cages of sI in combination with CH4 [29]. Due to the relatively high CO2 pressure, the area of the gaseous CO2 resonance (orange spheres) only slightly decreases as result of the exchange of CO2 for CH4 in the clathrate. As the exchange progresses, the area of the resonance associated with enclathrated CH4 decreases (green resonance, green spheres) while the area associated with gaseous CH4 (pink resonance, pink spheres) increases accordingly. The final spectral component at 130.17 ppm (purple resonance) is very sharp, almost liquid-like in nature, and is therefore assigned to the presence of a small fraction of liquid CO2. The potential availability of empty micropores, promoting capillary condensation from the gaseous phase, along with experimental conditions which are very close to the boiling point of CO2 at 3.5 MPa, i.e., 273 K, further justifies this assignment. As pointed out earlier, compatibility of the process with both gaseous and liquid CO2 opens up perspectives for real-world applications, as CO2 can be condensed and concentrated in the lower half of the reactor by optimizing operational pressure and temperature conditions, promoting bottom-up vacation of CH4 from the clathrate cages and avoiding excessive contamination of the CH4 gas stream with CO2. A quantitative assessment of the exchange rate and final exchange capacity of the presented system is beyond the scope of this perspective article. Follow-up experiments coupled with quantitative gas chromatography analysis of effluent gas streams will provide far more accurate data in the future. Nevertheless, this series of experiments clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the CH4/CO2 exchange mechanism underlying the proposed storage concept. 4 Application potential The introduced clathrate-based adsorption technology could have a wide span of applications in carbon neutral energy systems. As an illustration of the implementation potential of the CH4/CO2 storage tank, a carbon–neutral power-to-gas energy supply system is shown in Fig. 2 . Essential facilities such as hospitals and emergency services, critical industry and datacenters, require a reliable, non-interruptible power supply. Today, this function is fulfilled by a combination of battery powered UPS systems (short-term) and diesel-engine generated electricity (longer term), but our concept could provide an alternative. At the larger scale, the concept can provide sustainable firm power generation to island grids. Island grids are self-sustaining grids that are not connected to a larger grid because of their remoteness. Presently, such grids are mostly sustained using distributed oil-based generators, but island grid operators are actively looking for sustainable alternatives that can supplement intermittent renewables [30]. In addition to the need for dispatchable power generation for essential services or island grids, the 2022 energy crisis and rising energy procurement costs have sparked interest from small consumers (households) for grid independence [31]. Methane hydrate storage tanks can be delivered by truck and in combination with solid oxide fuel cells, they can offer a sustainable alternative to diesel generators [32,33]. After heat exchange between fuel cell feed (CH4) and flue gasses (CO2) and water condensation from the flue gas, CO2 can be stored into the storage tank. The CH4 delivery truck returns the CO2-filled tanks to a centralized methanization plant, where excess renewable energy can be used to close the cycle by electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4. Successful implementation of the exchange concept in a power supply chain could lead to large cost reductions with respect to other carbon–neutral alternatives. Using a gas hydrate system, improved with an exchange concept at the customers’ site, would simplify the supply chain and lower costs. Considering costs related to the storage tanks, both CapEx and OpEx expenditures for the operation are expected to be lowered. Fig. 3 shows storage tank cost estimations (CapEx) for systems using gas hydrate, both with (indicated by asterisk) and without the gas swapping approach. Technologies using high pressure gas compression of CH4 at 18 MPa and H2 at 112 MPa are added to provide a frame of reference. All storage tanks are dimensioned to store 1 MWh (Lower Heating Value) of energy in a volume of 570 l. Carbon capture from combustion processes at the small to medium scale is unpractical and not efficient. In order to enable more convenient carbon capture at these scales, and to avoid emission of activated nitrogen compounds, it is assumed that all technologies in Fig. 3 are combined with fuel cell technology. The physical separation of the anode and cathode compartments in fuel cells ensures CO2 flue gas is not diluted with nitrogen compounds, while the lower operating temperature avoids excessive NO x production. Fuel cell CapEx is not taken into account. Clathrate tanks are fit with an insulation jacket to minimize heat loss. A complete cost assessment should include operational expenditures such as cooling and compression costs in addition to CapEx costs. OpEx costs are, however, highly dependent on the specific use case (i.e., short vs. long term storage) and difficult to generalize. Consequently, the cost comparison between storage technologies was focused on CapEx costs. Details on the calculations and assumptions made for CapEx estimations can be found in the Supplementary Information. As a frame of reference, however, the OpEx costs for one specific use case were outlined in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1), together with a description of a specific use case and the assumptions made to define the case. Clearly, gas hydrate systems can be more cost-efficient than compressed methane storage at 18 MPa. Driven by lower operating pressures, gas hydrate systems with separate CO2 storage have the potential to be up to 59% cheaper than compression vessels storing CH4 at comparable volumetric densities. Using the gas exchange concept proposed in this work, the potential advantage of clathrate technology increases to 65%. Because of inherent compressibility difficulties associated with H2 compression, cost reductions compared to H2 storage are up to 93% (although fuel cell costs would be lower, as no carbon capture is needed). Fig. 4 details the differences between both gas hydrate systems more visibly. These results indicate that gas hydrate technology both with and without the exchange concept could become a cost-competitive alternative to compressed CH4 and compressed hydrogen storage. However, adding the exchange concept lowers CapEx estimations by 15%. And more importantly, the exchange concept strongly simplifies the balance of plant, which is an important factor in smaller-scale decentralized applications. 5 Conclusion Low-cost gas storage is one of the main hurdles keeping long duration decentralized power reserves from practical implementation. Relative to H2-based systems, CH4-based systems can store energy at more favorable conditions. However, the need for a separate CO2 cycle leads to less compact and more complicated applications. In this work, a novel storage concept is proposed based on CH4 and CO2 storage in the same pressure vessel. Utilizing the higher affinity of many adsorbents towards CO2, an exchange concept can be envisaged where CO2 gradually replaces CH4 on the adsorbent. Clathrate hydrates are an attractive adsorbent-like material class that can be used for this concept. Interestingly, hundreds of papers have explored the exchange of fossil CH4 for CO2 in natural clathrate hydrates. No longer bound by fixed natural conditions, a sustainable alternative exchange concept can be optimized in a controlled process environment, using dedicated tailor-made porous substrates. While the formation of large volumes of natural clathrate hydrates can take months, studies have shown that clathrates stabilized in synthetic porous materials, like PMOs, can reach minute-fast formation kinetics [22,24]. Building upon these observations, we provided the first experimental evidence for a gradual CH4/CO2 clathrate exchange in PMO material. We are confident that adapted storage vessel design and continued effort in customized porous material synthesis can lead to conversions surpassing current results in natural hydrate exploitation. Gas hydrate storage applications can tackle two of the most important challenges in conventional adsorption materials: material cost and heat management. Instead of serving as adsorption medium, low amounts of porous material are used to catalyze the formation of a water-based adsorbent at favorable conditions. Assuming successful implementation in decentralized energy reserve applications, our concept can be up to 65% more cost-efficient than conventional compressed CH4 storage. Given the importance of energy storage research going forward in the energy transitioning, and the large number of research groups that have an advanced understanding of the exchange concept (in the context of natural gas hydrate exploitation), we believe there is an opportunity for swift progress in an application without all the controversy associated with fossil energy recovery.
