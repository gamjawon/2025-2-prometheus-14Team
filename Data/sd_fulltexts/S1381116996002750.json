Baumgarten *, A. Fiebes, A. Stumpe, F. Ronkel, J.W. Schultze Institut f Physikalische Chemie and Elektrochemie der Uniuersit Dseldorf Uniuersitsstra 1, D-40225 Dseldorf Germany Received 4 December 1995; accepted 27 June 1996 Abstract In the following the synthesis of a new platinum supported catalyst founded upon the title copolymer is described. Adsorption of hexachloroplatinic acid through an ion exchange process followed by reduction in hydrogen leads to a catalyst which is useful in various heterogeneous gas phase reactions. Using several copolymers in different monomer proportions, it is demonstrated that a polymer carrier of composition 90% acrylamide and 10% quaternary compound is the most active one. On the basis of results obtained by use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy the presence of Nand ptZ+ species on the surface of the carrier is proved. It is shown that both species are influenced by amide and quaternary groups of the support. Taking the catalytic activity of samples which differ in the Ptand ptZ+ content into consideration, it is demonstrated that platinum in the zerovalent state is active in the reactions. Keywords: Polymer anchored catalysts; Platinum catalysts; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1. Introduction Since the first investigations of Akamatsu et al [ 1 ], deposition of transition metal atoms, e.g. platinum, on polymer surfaces with amide groups has received wide attention. Particularly, the use of supported nylon carriers in the hydrogenation of benzene has been investigated intensively [2-5]. In all examinations the authors found a quite different reaction behavior in comparison to catalysts based on oxide, e.g. aluminum oxide. Corresponding author.

PII S1381-1169(96)00275-0 In most of the studies it was suggested that platinum influenced by a nitrogen functionality acts as the active species. Nevertheless the oxidation state of the active sites is discussed controversial in the literature. Harrison and Rase supposed that a monatomic dispersion of metallic platinum is the reason for catalytic activity [6]. In opposition to this statement, many authors assume that platinum in a positive oxidation state is active in the reactions [2,4,5,7]. The research of Teichner et al. is in contradiction to this. They support the existence of metallic platinum, but not atomically dispersed [3]. During the intensive research on nylon carriers, various attempts were made to improve the 470 E. Baumgarten et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 469-477 low activity of the supported catalysts. The carrier materials were changed in order to obtain an ordered distribution of the platinum on the surface of the support. Using polyacrylamide, polyacrylnitrile, polyacrylamideoxime and several ion exchange resins, no improvement of catalytic activity was reached [2]. This may be caused by the fact that most of the chosen polymers were not soluble in the solvents used for the preparation of the catalyst. Therefore a homogeneous dispersion of the active compound on the polymer is not very probable. The fact that most of the applied polymers have more adsorption sites than necessary to anchor the metallic precursor also seems to be disadvantageous for a regular distribution of the metal compound. Taking this into consideration, a cationic, water soluble polyelectrolyte is used to anchor the metal salt in this study. We will show that this polyelectrolyte will be capable not only of ion exchange (quaternary ammonium group) but also of complexation (amide group). The work along this direction was successful in so far as the cationic group enables a definite anchoring of the metal salt. After complexation of the precursor through an amide group of the same copolymer unit, this preparation leads to a homogeneous dispersion of the active compound. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials The polymer carriers investigated were statistical copolymers of acrylamide (Aam) and 3(acryloylamino)propyltrimethylammoniumchloride (TCA) in different monomer proportions. They were synthesized by radical polymerization from aqueous solution at Chemische Fabrik Stockhausen (Krefeld, Germany). The structural formulae of the polyelectrolyte is listed in Scheme 1. The average molecular weights of the carriers (Mw: _ 106) were measured by a static and a dynamic method using gel permeation chromatography and low angle light scattering [8]. The polymers were purified by ultrafiltration using a Minitian system with four polysulfon plates (10000 nm). Hexachloroplatinic acid (H 2 ptC16 - 6H 20, purity > 99%, Degussa) as supporting material, and the reagents for the catalytic reaction (see Table 1 Catalytic activity in several reactions of poly-{acrylamide-co-[3-(acryloylamino)propyltrimethylammoniumchloride]} in the proportion 90% Aam and 10%a TCA Substrate Pressure (hPa) Catalyst (mg) Flow (ml/min) Temp. a () Yield (%) Hexene Cyclohexene Benzene Nitrobenzene Chlorobenzene Products (%) 117 60 58 12 56 20 50 20 50 50 50 50 10 10 10 120 160 160 140 160 75 15 5 72 10 12 92 6 50 18 hexane t-hexene c-hexene cyclohexane benzene cyclohexane aniline benzene benzene cyclohexane Acetaldehyde 560 50 10 160 Crotonaldehyde 60 50 10 160 4 butyraldehyde Mesityloxide 53 50 10 160 - - Benzaldehyde 33 50 10 160 4 cyclohexylcarbald.

Preparation of the catalysts Loading of the polymers with hexachloroplatinic acid was carried out according to the general procedure outlined below. 200 mg of the polymer was dissolved in 30-50 ml water. After complete dissolution, an aqueous solution of the platinum salt (platinum content 6 mg ^, 3% platinum on the carrier) was added. This step was followed by stirring the solution for 20 h. During this time, the ion exchange of Cl- against ptC162- reached equilibrium. The polymers thus loaded were precipitated by adding 200 ml of a solution of calcium chloride in methanol. Subsequently, the catalyst was washed with methanol and dried at room temperature under reduced pressure. Finally the loaded polymer was reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere for two hours at 180. Without this last preparation step, the catalysts were not active in any reaction. 2.3. Catalytic reaction experiments The catalytic reaction experiments were carried out in a flow microreactor connected to a gas chromatograph. The reactor consisted of a glass tube (length: 28 cm, diameter: 0.7 cm), which was heated by an oven coupled with a thermoregulator. The liquid reactant was held in a thermostated evaporator and vaporized into a stream of dried and deoxygenated hydrogen gas which bubbled through the reactant. Usually 471 20-50 mg of the catalyst powder was placed in the reactor and held in place by means of a porous glass frit. A flow rate of 10-50 ml/min was used. In a typical catalysis experiment the product stream was sampled periodically for the online GC analysis. Products were separated using a dimethylpolysiloxan column. As gas chromatograph, a Sigma 4 from Perkin Elmer, equipped with a flame ionization detector, was used. 2.4. Characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy All X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained from a VG-Instruments ESCALAB 5 (Mg(K a ) radiation ( E = 1253.6 eV)). The lowest binding energy component of the C 1 s signal was assigned to be 285.0 eV for charging reference. Using polymers prepared by the procedure described above, problems arose, caused by the low platinum content and the porosity of the carrier. Therefore the preparation process was modified and the platinum content increased up to 11 %. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the polymer-metal solution was coated as a thin film on a gold sheet. After evaporation of the solvent in an oven, the samples were analyzed. To ensure a high dispersion of the metal a polymer in the proportion 20% acrylamide and 80% quaternary compound was used as carrier. 2.5. Characterization by FTIR-spectroscopy In order to confirm the results of the XPS investigations, the absorption frequencies of platinum bound CO have been investigated. The studies were carried out in the range 1000-4000 cm-'. For the measurements the loaded polymer was coated as a thin film on a silicon disk. To cover the polymer-bonded platinum with CO the polymer film was reduced in a carbon monoxide atmosphere at 180. For these experiments we used a Bio-Rad FTS-40 spectrometer and an effective resolution of 0.5 cm-'. 472 3. Results and discussion 3.1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Fig. 1 shows platinum spectra for platinum foil (a), polymer loaded with hexachloroplatinic acid before reduction (b) and after reduction with hydrogen for 6 h (c) and 12 h (d). The spectrum of the platinum foil (a) was recorded for reference. The spectrum (a) consists of two peaks separated by 3.35 eV. The higher binding energy peak is caused by Pt 4f5/2 electrons, the lower binding energy peak by Pt 4f7/2 electrons. The area ratio Pt 4f7/2:Pt 4f5/2 is 1.27. As it is the case for the platinum foil, spectrum (b) for the polymer loaded with hexachloroplatinic acid shows two clearly separated peaks with similar separation and area ratios, Platinuf) 8 Pt (0) Pt (4+) Pt (z+) Pt (2+) e7 eg 7, 73 75 77 Binding En~ IsVJ Fig. 1.

These peaks are assigned to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 peaks for Pt4+. No reduction of the platinum took place during the loading process. After reduction of the loaded polymer with hydrogen, the shape of the platinum peaks changes dramatically (spectra c and d). One broad peak is obtained. This peak can be deconvoluted into Ptand Pt2+ peaks as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The amount of Ptincreases with reduction time. But even after 12 h reduction with hydrogen, Pt2+ species are still present. This is probably caused by the fact that the polymer foil used in XPS analysis is difficult to reduce in comparison to the porous material employed in catalytic experiments. Fig. 2(A-D) shows the element regions of C (1 s), N (1 s), O (1 s) and Cl (2p) for the pure polymer (a), the polymer loaded with hexachloroplatinic acid (b) and the polymer with hexachloroplatinic acid after reduction with hydrogen for 6 h (c). The carbon is peak is deconvoluted into five peaks for the species indicated in Scheme 1. Only small changes in the peak shape and area E. Baumgarten et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 469-477 ratios can be recognized between the three spectra (Fig. 2A; Table 3). The loading of the polymer with hexachloroplatinic acid and the reduction of the polymer do not influence the C 1 s XPS signal. So the polymer itself is not altered during the preparation process and no reduction of the C=O groups of the polymer took place. In contrast to platinum catalysts supported by polyamide-6 [7], a significant change can be seen in the nitrogen spectra (Fig. 2B; Table 3). The N 1 s signal for the pure polymer consists of two peaks. One for the amide groups (399.9 eV), and one for the quaternary ammonia group (402.7 eV). When hexachloroplatinic acid is loaded onto the polymer, the overall peak shape of the N 1 s signal changes and the spectrum cannot be deconvoluted using two peaks only. A third peak at 400.8 eV is necessary to fit the signal. We believe this third peak is due to pt4+ binding to amide and (or) quaternary groups. About 15% of the nitrogen functions are affected by platinum. Taking the amount of platinum which is loaded onto the polymer into consideration, a stabilization of the platinum through two quaternary and one (or more) amide group seems to be possible. The platinum complex remains stable even after reduction to Pt\" and Ptas changes in the XPS signal are only minor. 473 The O Is (Fig. 2C, Table 3) signal is broad in all cases. It probably consists of two peaks. One for the C=O group and one from residual water, since the polymer is hygroscopic. The signal does not change during the loading and reduction processes. This can be due to the reason that the C=O group is not affected by the platinum. For the chlorine signal of the pure polymer (labeled peak 1 in Fig. 2D) one can see the Cl 2p1/2 peak as a shoulder of the Cl 2P3/2 peak. Peak deconvolution gives a separation of 1.6 eV and an area ratio Cl 2P3/2:C1 2p,/2 of 1.95. After loading the polymer with hexachloroplatinic acid additional peaks from the ptC126 (peak 2) can be seen. The spectrum changes to a broad asymmetric peak. As a conclusion of the above XPS-data, the following statements can be made: 1. After loading of the polymer with H 2 PtCl6 at room temperature, only Pt\" species are present on the polymer. A partial or complete reduction of the platinum during the loading or drying process (as reported for drying at 150 [7]) does not occur. 2. The platinum binds to amide and quaternary groups of the polymer as can be seen from the change in the N 1 s XPS signal. 3. After reduction, Pt2+ and Ptspecies are present.

Since the catalytic activity in the different reactions (see below) is also increased with reduction time, Ptis supposed to be the catalytic active species. 4. The polymer backbone remains unchanged throughout the preparation process (loading with H 2 PtC16 and reduction with H 2 ) 3.2. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The FTIR investigations of adsorbed CO on the supported polymer corroborate the statements made in the discussion of the XPS-data. Additionally we were able to show that the active species is the same for all monomer proportions of the carrier. When carrying out these measurements, we first detected a CO-vibration at 2100 cm-'. During the reduction this peak decreased and a new band at 2034 cm-' appeared which increased by further reduction with carbon monoxide. At the end of the process we found two peaks. A very small one at 2100 cm-' and a strong one at 2034 cm-1. For the first peak we assume the existence of a pt2+ species, for the second a Ptspecies. In comparison with literature data of 2070 cm-1 for the CO-vibration of carbonyl which is bonded to zerovalent platinum dispersed on aluminum oxide [9], this position seems to be surprising. Nevertheless, this significant shift towards lower wavenumbers can be explained by an electron transfer to the metal, probably from amide groups to the platinum. 3.3. Catalytic reaction A short synopsis of the catalytic behavior of the new catalyst system is given in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1. Fig. 3 shows a typical temperature characteristic of the catalyst illustrated by conversion of 1-hexene.

The content of 2-hexene was unexpectedly high since the reaction was earned out under a pure hydrogen atmosphere. The cis/trans ratio of 0.4 found at 180 was close to the value of 0.34 calculated for the thermodynamic equilibrium. In comparison to this behavior, we did not find any isomerization activity for platinum dispersed on alumina. Therefore we assume a different adsorption capacity for our type of catalyst. One possible explanation is the influence of related amide groups which changes the electronic state of platinum just as in the case of the nylon earners. During our experimental work, we also found a dependence of catalytic activity on copolymer 476 100,00 90,00 eo,0o 70,00 60,00 30,00 40,00 30,00 20,00 10,00 0,00- E.

The results of these investigations are shown in Fig. 4. One notes that the supported polymers of composition 90/ 10 and 70/30 are the catalysts with the highest activities. The high activity of the 90/ 10 copolymer in comparison with the others suggests that the active compound is better dispersed in the case of this polymer. Scanning electron microscopy measurements [10] also confirm this. This is probably caused by a definite bonding of PtCl6- through an ion exchange mechanism followed by a stabilization through amide groups of the same copolymer unit. The low activity of both homopolymers emphasizes the speculation that a homogeneous dispersion cannot be obtained if there are more adsorption sites for the precursor complex than necessary. In order to examine the catalytic efficiency in more detail, several other reactions were stud- ied. The results are summarized in Table 1. The findings show a good agreement with the properties reported for other catalysts based on nitrogen containing polymer carriers [ 1,11 ]. Remarkable is the high activity in hydrogenation of C=C double bonds, reduction of nitrobenzene and hydrodehalogenation. Another important feature is that the carbonyl function of aldehydes and ketones cannot be reduced. Nevertheless some differences were found in comparison to the catalytic behavior of nylon carriers reported by Sermon [4]. In the hydrogenation of benzene, we found no cyclohexene and, in the reaction of cyclohexene, we found a simultaneous disproportionation to benzene and cyclohexane. Finally the catalytic behavior of the polymer foils used in XPS analysis were investigated in an attempt to clarify the nature of the active species. In comparison to the porous material used in the catalytic measurements, the foils showed a significantly lower activity. Since catalytic activity is also increased with Ptcontent, the metal is supposed to be the catalytic active compound. The lower catalytic activity of the foils can then be explained by a lower number of accessible catalytic sites due to lower porosity and incomplete reduction of HZPtCIb. Taking all catalytic measurements and the results of the characterization into consideration, it is likely that the active species in our catalyst is similar to that in the catalysts based on nylon carriers. A possible structure for the Polymaxh. =O CHa~4I 31V--CHi o Cl H=Z CI, 'CHa -Mj`kV,--CH? Scheme 2. E. Baumgarten et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 469-477 stabilization of the metal is listed in Scheme 2. References It seems to be proved that the high activity of our system is caused by a better dispersion of the active compound. 4. Conclusion The new copolymer based catalyst shows some similarity with the ones based on nylon carriers, but has a remarkably higher activity, which can be attributed to a higher dispersion of the active compound. This might be caused by a definite bonding of ptC12- through an ion ex change process followed by the stabilization through amide groups. With a high probability, platinum in the zerovalent state, influenced by related nitrogen functionalities, acts as the ac tive species. But a catalytic activity of Pt2+ cannot be ruled out completely. 477 [1] A. Akamatsu, Y. Azumi and S. Akobori, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 34 (1961) 1067. [2] P. Dini, D. Dones, S. Montelatici and N.

In the following the synthesis of a new platinum supported catalyst founded upon the title copolymer is described. Adsorption of hexachloroplatinic acid through an ion exchange process followed by reduction in hydrogen leads to a catalyst which is useful in various heterogeneous gas phase reactions. Using several copolymers in different monomer proportions, it is demonstrated that a polymer carrier of composition 90% acrylamide and 10% quaternary compound is the most active one. On the basis of results obtained by use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy the presence of Pt0 and Pt2+ species on the surface of the carrier is proved. It is shown that both species are influenced by amide and quaternary groups of the support. Taking the catalytic activity of samples which differ in the Pt0 and Pt2+ content into consideration, it is demonstrated that platinum in the zerovalent state is active in the reactions.
