Luft * University of Darmstadt, Institute for Chemical Engineering, Petersenstr. 20, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany Received 20 July 1994; accepted 7 August 1995 Abstract The copolymerization of etSiylene and linear 1-olefins under high pressure and high temperature was examined using a metallocene/methylaluminoxane system. The reactivity ratios of copolymerization as well as the physical properties of the resulting copolymers were determined. The polymerization was performed in a continuously operated stirred autoclave at 150 MPa and in the temperature range between 393 K and 493 K. A ratio of 22000 mol Al/mol Zr was applied base upon a metallocene concentration of 6 X 10\"3 mol-ppm. 1. Introduction The main aim of this research work was to eval- uate the behavior of uifferent linear 1-olefins in the copolymerization with eihyiene using a metal- locene/methylaluminoxane catalyst system under high pressure. The comonomers were 1 \"bute, 1-hexene and 1-decene besides propene, which was used earlier [ 1 ]. For this purpose the produc- tivity and the reactivity ratios should be consid- ered. Furthermore the physical properties of the resulting copolymers like average molecular weights, density, melting temperature and their dependency on the polymerization conditions, especially on the concentration of the comonomer in the feed, should be compared. * Corresponding author. 1 For Part I see r.

Experimental The continuously operated pilot unit used for polymerization was described earlier together with the experimental technique [ 11. The liquid comonomers hexcne and 1-decene were fed by means of the high pressure membrane pump which was used also to meter condensed propene and 1-bute. The polymerization tests were performed at a pressure of 150 MPa, with temperatures in t^e range of 393 to 493 K and a residence time of 240 s. Again the same silyl-bridged b(tetra1 dromdenyl)zirconocene was used in a concentration of 0.006 mol-ppm in the feed gas [11. Cocatalyst was methylaiummoxane ( MAO). The ratio ofcocatalyst to catalyst metal was 22000 mol Al/mol Zr. The concentration of the comon- omer in the feed was varied up to 100 mol%. 88 C. Bergmann et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Cheifiictil 105 (1996) 87-91 3. Results The copolymerization diagram for the different comonomers is shown in Fig. 1. In the diagram the molar ratio of ethylene to comonomer in the polymer is plotted versus the ratio of the compo- nents in the reactor. For this purpose the concentrations of ethylene and comonomer in the reactor were first calculated from the feed rates of all components and the composition of the polymer by means of a total mass balance. In the range of concentrations which were investigated the ratio of comonomer to ethylene incorporated into the polymer increased linearly with the ratio of the components present in the reactor. The highest rate of incor- poration oftlie comonomer was obtained with pro- pene. At a ratio of 0.5 mol propene to mol ethylene in the reactor the ratio of propene to ethylene in the copolymer was 0.04. It decreased to around 0.01 when 1 -bute was the comonomer. Lower incorporation ratios were found when 1-hexene or 1-decene were used as the comonomer. From the composition of the copolymer and the ratio of comonomer to monomer in the reactor the reactivity ratios were determined using the meth- ods of Finemann and Ross 12] as well as that of Kissin and Bohm [ 3,4]. The reactivity ratios eval- uated are collected in Table 1, in which 1 stands for '.hylenp and ^ for the comonomer. The reac- t;r, ratio r, was found in the range of 12.43 (propene) to 80.02 (1-decene) whereas ^ decreased from 0.08 with propene to 0.01 with 1- decene. The other results will be discussed from a chem- ical engineer's point of view. Therefore in the following diagrams all results were plotted versus the comonomer concentration in the feed. When the concentration of the comonomer in the reactor is considered the curves are shifted to the right and to the left when the amount of comonomer incorporated into the polymer is considered. The shift is more steep with 1-decene and less steep with propene. With each comonomer around 20 polymeriza- tion tests were performed.

D == 1 - decene. with the behaviour of propene the productivity of the catalyst used in the copolymerization with the other comonomers decreased also with increasing comonomer concentration in the feed. The pro- ductivity decreased in the order propene, 1- butene, 1-hexene to 1-decene. The average molecular weights Mn and M^, measured by means of GPC at 135 in 1,2,4- trichlorobenzene using styre polymers as ref- erences, showed a steep decrease up to a comonomer concentration of 10 to 20 mol% in the feed and remained then nearly constant at higher comonomer concentrations as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The lowest values ofMn were measured on sam- ples with 1 -decene. They increased when 1-bute and propene were used. The highest number average molecular weights were obtained with 1- hexene. The weight average molecular weights of the copolymers prepared with different comonomers are compared in Fig. 4. M^ decreased with increasing concentration of the comonomer in the feed. Again the lowest values ofMw resulted with 1-decene whereas the copolymers with 1-hexene were found with the highest weight average molecular weights. The density of the copolymers decreased with the comonomer concentration in the feed as shown m Fig. 5. The density of tue ethykrie homopoly- mer was 0.965 g/cm3, whereas the density of the propene homopolymer was only 0.885 g/cm3. The homopolymer formed using 1 -decene showed the lowest density. The melting temperatures of the various copol- ymers are plotted in Fig. 6 again versus the con- centrations of the comonomer in the feed together with the melting temperature of the homopoly- mers. The ethylene homopolymer showed the highest melting temperature of 132. When pro- pene was added to the ethylene feed the melting temperature decreased. With the propene homo- polymer a melting temperature of 100 was observed. The lowest melting temperature showed the homopoiymer of i-decene. 90 C.

Also the crystallanitv of the copolymers decreased with increasing concentration of the comonomer in the feed as presented in Fig. 7. The ethylene homopolymer showed the highest crys- tallinity. The lowest crystallinity was found for the homopolymer of 1-decene. 4. Conclusion The most interesting result is the good ability of the metallocene/MAO system in the copoly- merization of ethylene not only with propene but also with l-olefins of higher chain length. Up to a ratio of 0.04 mol propene / mol ethylene could be incorporated into the polymer at a ratio of 0.5 mol propene / mol ethyiene present in the reactor. At the same ratio of comonomer to ethylene in the reactor the ratio of comonomer to monomer in the copolymer was in the range of 0.01. The high performance of the zirconocene cat- alyst became obvious when its productivity was considered. The productivity was 4500 kg PE/ g Zr in the homopolymerization of ethylene. It decreased only to half this value when the feed gas contained 20 mol% propene. At the same level of 1-decene the productivity was reasonable high and was around 500 kg PE/ g Zr. The lower reactivity in the polymerization with 1 -olefins of greater chain length can be attrib- uted to steric effects. All physical properties of the copolymers depend on the comonomer and its concentration in the feed gas. As it is known from the polym- erization with heterogeneous Ziegler catalysts under low pressure the density of the copolymers prepared with metallocenes can be controlled by the addition of l-olefins. The decrease of the average molecular weight with increasing concentration of the comonomer in the feed results from lower reactivity of the comonomer especially of 1 -decene and the higher rate of chain transfer to these comonomers which give rise of termination of the growing chains. Concerning the polydispersity, which can be calculated from the weight average molecular weight and the ns'mbcr average molecular weight all polymer samples showed a small polydispers- ity in the range from 2 tu 3, so it can be concluded that only one active site is present under the high pressure/high temperature conditions using this type of metallocene/MAO catalyst system. Incorporation of propene, 1-bute etc. led to the formation of short side chains in the copolymer which hinder the close arrangement of polymer chains and decrease the density. Copolymers with a density in the range of 0.965 lu 0.85 g/cin3 can be prepared using this type of catalyst system depending on the comonomer which was used. For the same reason the melting temperature is lowered using higher comonomer concentrations in the feed. C.
