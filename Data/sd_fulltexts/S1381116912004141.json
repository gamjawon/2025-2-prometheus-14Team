Graphical abstract Highlights ► New Zr complexes bearing indolyl-pyridylamido ligands have been synthesized. ► The complexes catalyze the polymerization of ethylene and propene. ► High molecular weight linear PEs and highly isotactic PPs were obtained. ► The size of the substituents on the ligands plays a critical role in the catalysis. New zirconium complexes bearing indolyl-pyridylamido ligands [−NNN−] have been synthesized and used as catalysts in ethylene and propene polymerization in the presence of AliBu2H/MAO as cocatalytic system. Complexes 1 and 2, bearing ligands with a different steric hindrance on the carbon bridging the pyridine and the aniline moieties, exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for ethylene and propene polymerization, affording ultrahigh molecular weight polymers with monomodal molecular weight distributions. Moreover, the presence of the 2-isopropyl phenyl substituent on the bridging carbon (complex 2) resulted in higher stereoselectivity and regioselectivity providing a polypropylene sample with an [mmmm] content up to 96% and 1.3% of regioinversion. On the other hand, the change of the substituents of the aniline moiety (complex 3) gave a zirconium complex which resulted completely inactive both in the ethylene and propene polymerization. Keywords Zirconium Olefin polymerization Isospecific catalysts Homogeneous catalysis Propene 1 Introduction Recent research in the field of olefin polymerization has been focused on a variety of polydentate ligand frameworks based on nitrogen and/or oxygen and/or sulfur donors, resulting in the discovery of catalysts displaying excellent performance and peculiar features, such as living polymerization at high temperature and chain shuttling between two different active species, allowing the synthesis of novel macromolecular architectures [1]. One of the most successful class of stereoselective catalysts recently introduced is based on arylpyridylamido Hf(IV) complexes, discovered and optimized by researchers at Dow and Symyx using high throughput screening technologies and currently used in commercial production of some polypropylene-based resins [2]. The excellent performance of these catalysts for the production of highly isotactic, high molecular weight polypropylene at high temperature in solution processes depends on in situ arylcyclometallation reactions, changing a [NN] monoanionic ligand into a [CNN] dianionic tridentate one and, possibly, by further ligand modifications, such as monomer insertion into a HfCaryl bond [2,3]. In this respect, we have previously reported penta-coordinate group 4 metal complexes bearing dianionic pyrrolylpyridylamido [−NNN−] tridentate ligands [4] (Chart 1 , complexes I) which resulted in stereospecific catalysts, producing high molecular weight polypropylenes (M w up to 106 g/mol) with high isotacticity ([mmmm] up to 95%), and high melting temperatures (T m >150°C). The same class of ligands were used for the synthesis of group 3 and aluminum complexes active in the ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters. [5] We report here the synthesis of some related Zr(IV) complexes bearing tridentate [−NNN−] ligands, in which the pyrrolide group was replaced by the bulkier and more electron donating indolyde group (Chart 1, complexes II), and their use as precatalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propene. 2 Experimental 2.1 General procedures All manipulations of air- and/or water-sensitive compounds were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk or glovebox techniques. All solvents, purchased from Carlo Erba, were refluxed over sodium/benzophenone or calcium hydride (CaH2) and then distilled under nitrogen atmosphere before use. 1-Bromo-2-isopropylbenzene was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used as received. Solid MAO (10wt% solution in toluene) was obtained by distilling off the volatile materials under reduced pressure and excess of trimethylaluminum was removed by washing the resulting solid with dry hexane, and drying under vacuum the obtained white powder. Ethylene and propene were purchased from SON and used without further purification. N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-indole-2-boronic acid [6] and 4,6-dimethyl-2-(2-phenylethyl)aniline [7] were prepared by literatures procedures. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 400MHz and 100.6MHz, respectively. 13C NMR spectra of polymers were recorded on a Bruker AM-250 spectrometer operating at 62.5MHz in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 (C2D2Cl4) at 100°C and referenced vs hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS). Molecular weights (M n and M w) and polydispersity indexes (PDI) of polymers were determined by high-temperature GPC using a Waters GPC-V200 RI detector. The measurements were recorded at 135°C using 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a solvent and Styragel columns (range 103–106 Å). Every value was the average of two independent measurements. Polymers melting points (T m) were measured by differential scanning calorimetry using a TA Instruments DSC 2920 in nitrogen flow with a heating and cooling rate of 10°C/min.

Under nitrogen atmosphere, the required equivalents of AliBu2H were added to a solution of the precatalyst in toluene (2mL) and then stirred for 10min at room temperature. The reactor vessels were charged sequentially with toluene, dried MAO and a solution of the precatalyst in toluene. The stirred mixture was thermostated at the required temperature and then the monomer gas feed was started. After the prescribed time, the polymerization mixture was poured into acidified ethanol. The polymers were filtered, washed with ethanol, and dried in vacuum oven at 40°C overnight. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of proligands and complexes Indolyl-pyridylamine proligands H 2 L 1 and H 2 L 2 were synthesized via the Suzuky-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction [4a,8] of 6-bromo-2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde with N-Boc-indole-2-boronic acid (Boc=tert-butyloxycarbonyl), affording tert-butyl 2-(6-formylpyridine-2-yl)-1H-indole-1-carboxylate (A) as yellow solid in 86% yield (see Scheme 1 ). A condensation reaction between A and 2,6-diisopropylaniline gave the indolylpyridylimine compound B as light yellow solid (yield: 78%); subsequent reduction with NaBH3CN or, alternatively, alkylation with 2-iPrC6H4Li, gave indolyl-pyridylamine proligands (yields: 85% for H 2 L 1 , 88% for H 2 L 2 , respectively). H 2 L 3 was synthesized via the condensation reaction of 4,6-dimethyl-2-(2-phenylethyl)aniline with 6-bromo-2-pyridine-carboxaldehyde and subsequent Suzuky-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with N-Boc-indole-2-boronic acid [4a], affording B as a yellow solid (71% yield). After reduction with NaBH3CN and Boc removal by silica gel 60, H 2 L 3 was obtained in 40% yield. All the compounds were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Complexes 1–3 were synthesized in benzene by treatment of the corresponding proligands with one equivalent of tetrakis(dimethylamido)-zirconium(IV) at room temperature, and isolated as light-yellow solids in high yield (70% for 1, 91% for 2, 78% for 3, respectively). 1H NMR analysis of complex 1 indicated a “time-averaged” Cs-symmetry in solution, as suggested, e.g., by the presence of one singlet for the CH 2Namido methylene protons at 4.89ppm and of one sharp singlet for the ZrNMe 2 amido protons. In contrast, the 1H NMR spectra of complexes 2 and 3 suggested a C1-symmetry in solution. For complex 2, three septets were observed for the methine protons of isopropyl groups and two sharp singlets for the ZrNMe2 protons (2.65 and 3.00ppm). In the spectrum of complex 3 the two protons of the methylene bridge appear as an AB pattern, and two sharp singlets for ZrNMe 2 (2.85 and 2.70ppm) were observed. The 1H NMR spectrum of complex 3 showed the presence of two species at a ratio of ca. 9:1. A plausible explanation is the coexistence of two rotational diasteroisomers due to the hindered rotation around the CN bond of the 4,6-dimethyl-2-(2-phenylethyl)anilido moiety [9]. 3.2 Ethylene and propene polymerization Indolylpyridylamido complexes 1–3 were tested as precatalysts for ethylene polymerization in combination with AliBu2H as alkylating agent (in view of the well-known difficult alkylation of dimethylamido group 4 complexes by MAO alone) [10] and MAO as ionizing activator. As explored in previous papers [4] this is the most efficient cocatalytic system for this class of complexes. The main polymerization data are summarized in Table 1 , where the results previously reported [4] for the analogous pyrrolylpyridylamido zirconium complexes (see Chart 1) are also displayed for comparison. Complexes 1 and 2 were active ethylene polymerization catalysts (runs 1 and 2), producing highly linear polyethylenes (T m: 135–136°C). As previously observed [4], the introduction of a bulky substituent on the carbon bridging the pyridyl and the anilido moieties resulted in a more active catalyst (a 2-fold increase is observed). In comparison with the corresponding pyrrolylpyridylamido zirconium catalysts (runs 4 and 5), the activities of 1 and 2 are comparable. GPC analysis of the polyethylene samples produced by 1 and 2 revealed ultra high molecular weights (710kg/mol for 1; 1900kg/mol for 2) and slightly broad molecular weight distributions, in line with the results achieved by the pyrrolylpyridylamido catalysts. On the contrary, complex 3, bearing a substituted 4,6-dimethyl-2-(2-phenylethyl)anilido moiety, was inactive for ethylene polymerization (run 3). A similar finding was reported by Coates et al. [3], for an arylpyridylamido hafnium catalyst bearing a ligand with two 4-tert-butylphenyl group in the ortho positions of the anilido moiety, and tentatively explained suggesting a possible η6-binding of the 4-tert-butylphenyl group to the cationic hafnium center precluding monomer binding. Complexes 1–3 were then tested for propene polymerization after activation with AliBu2H/MAO under 6 atm monomer pressure. The main polymerization data are summarized in Table 2 , where the results previously reported [4] for the analogous pyrrolylpyridylamido complexes (runs 11–13) are also displayed for comparison. The unsubstituted catalyst 1 promoted polymerization of propene, producing isotactic polypropylene ([mmmm]=86%) with rather low MW and quite narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI=1.2). Interestingly, the performance in terms of both activity and stereoselectivity are significantly better than the corresponding unsubstituted pyrrolylpyridylamido Zr(IV) catalyst Ia (run 6 vs run 11). Also in the case of Cs-symmetric complex 1, the polymer microstructure is that expected for an “enantiomorphic sites” mechanism of steric control, as previously observed for Ia and for a Cs-symmetric arylpyridylamido Hf complex [3]. In the latter case, a modification of the catalyst structure by propene insertion into a Hf-aryl bond resulting in a C1-symmetric active species was suggested. The same mechanism would be unlikely for complexes 1 and I-a, for which different hypotheses have been suggested [4a]. The isopropylphenyl-substituted C1-symmetric indolylpyridylamido zirconium catalyst 2 also showed better performance than the corresponding pyrrolylpyridylamido zirconium catalyst I-b (run 8 vs run 12). In both cases, the introduction of a bulky substituent on the carbon bridging the pyridine and the aniline moieties resulted in higher stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. Polymerization at higher temperature (run 7) resulted in a 4 to 5-fold decrease of activity of unsubstituted catalyst 1. However, only a slight decrease of activity was observed for polymerization at 75°C using substituted catalyst 2 (run 9), while a greater loss of activity was observed for the corresponding pyrrolyl catalyst I-b (run 13). The features of the polypropylene sample derived from catalyst 2 at high temperature (run 9), in terms of molecular weight (>100kg/mol), melting point (143°C) and narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI=1.7), are comparable to those of the polymers obtained by the highly optimized metallocene catalysts (M w =95kg/mol, T m =142°C, PDI=2, polymerization performance at 90°C) [1a]. For all the polypropylene samples, some regiodefects, deriving from head-to-head or tail-to-tail misinsertions, were detected by NMR analysis [11,12]. As previously observed for arylpyridylamido [2c] and other “post-metallocene” [4,11b] catalysts, regioinverted units with vicinal methyls in threo configuration in the Fischer projection were exclusively present, indicating that primary (1,2) and secondary (2,1) monomer insertion occur with the same enantioface selectivity. In the 13C NMR spectrum of the low molecular weight polypropylene sample produced by catalyst 1, additional low intensity resonances were detected (Fig. S4 in the supporting information). According to the literatures [13], low intensity resonances at 45.4, 23.7, 21.8, 20.5ppm are attributable to isobutyl end groups, while resonances at 37.6, 28.4, 17.9, 12.4ppm are attributable to n-propyl end groups, reasonably arising from two consecutive primary (1,2) propene insertions into Zrhydrogen bonds, generated from the reaction of amido Zr(IV) complexes with AliBu2H. An alternative path producing n-propyl end groups would involve termination by hydrolysis of a growing chain after a 2,1 insertion of propene into a Zr-primary growing chain. For the related Cs-symmetric pyrrolylpyridylamido Zr(IV) complex Ia, a deuterium labeling experiment ruled out the latter path [4a]. The ratio between n-propyl and isobutyl end-groups is about 1:2. The proposed catalytic cycle for the polymerization of propene promoted by complexes 1 and 2 is shown in Scheme 2 . As observed for ethylene polymerization, complex 3 was substantially inactive also for the polymerization of propene. 4 Conclusions We have reported the synthesis and characterization of three new zirconium complexes bearing dianionic indolyl-pyridylamido [−NNN−] tridentate ligands. All complexes have been tested as catalysts for ethylene and propene polymerization after activation with AliBu2H/MAO. Complexes 1 and 2 were able to catalyze the ethylene polymerization under mild conditions (25°C and 1atm of monomer pressure), yielding ultrahigh-molecular-weight PE's (M w up to 1900kg/mol). They also promote polymerization of propene, producing isotactic polypropylene ([mmmm] up to 96%) with narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI=1.2). 13C NMR analysis of the obtained polypropylenes revealed a microstructure in agreement with the “enantiomorphic sites” mechanism of the stereoselective propagation. The analysis of the chain end groups suggests that 1,2 insertion is the main regiochemistry of propagation. The analysis of the regioinverted units in the polymer chains indicate that primary and secondary monomer insertions occur with the same enantioface selectivity. Both catalysts show, in the propene polymerization, higher activity and stereoselectivity than the corresponding pyrrolyl-pyridylamido Zr(IV) catalysts suggesting that the bulkier and more electron donating indolide group has a beneficial effect on the performance of this class of complexes. On the other hand, complex 3 bearing the substituted 4,6-dimethyl-2-(2-phenylethyl) anilido moiety was inactive for both ethylene and propene polymerization. A plausible explanation is the η6-binding of the phenyl group to the cationic zirconium center which may preclude monomer binding [3] although steric effects cannot be excluded. These results confirm that the effects of variation of structural parameters on reactivity and stereoselectivity are difficult to predict also for the members of a single class of catalysts.

Complexes 1 and 2, bearing ligands with a different steric hindrance on the carbon bridging the pyridine and the aniline moieties, exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for ethylene and propene polymerization, affording ultrahigh molecular weight polymers with monomodal molecular weight distributions. Moreover, the presence of the 2-isopropyl phenyl substituent on the bridging carbon (complex 2) resulted in higher stereoselectivity and regioselectivity providing a polypropylene sample with an [mmmm] content up to 96% and 1.3% of regioinversion. On the other hand, the change of the substituents of the aniline moiety (complex 3) gave a zirconium complex which resulted completely inactive both in the ethylene and propene polymerization.",
