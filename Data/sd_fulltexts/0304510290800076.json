PART m. IN SITU STUDIES OF SUPPORTED AND BULK CATALYSTS UNDER REACTION AND REDOX CONDITIONS JAMES H. WILSON III*, CHARLES G. HILL, JB.** and JAMES A. DUMESIC Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, 1415 Johnson Drive, Madison, WI 53706 (U.SA.) (Received February 21,1990; accepted March 5,1990) Summary Raman spectra of both supported and unsupported Fe/Mo/0 catalysts of the type used for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde were obtained while this reaction was proceeding over the catalyst surface. No changes in band locations or relative peak intensities associated with these mixed metal oxides were detected in the presence of reactant and product species. Moreover, no spectral features which could be attributed to adsorbed species could be detected under reaction conditions. Band intensities in the Raman spectra were related to the extent to which the catalysts were reduced; fully oxidized catalysts were stronger Raman scatterers than partially reduced catalysts. Although differences in color were noted between fresh and used catalysts, the Raman and Mossbauer spectra of these catalysts were identical. Calcination of used catalysts in an oxygen environment at 500 C was sufficient to restore partially reduced catalysts to their original fully oxidized states. Introduction Iron molybdates are industrially significant mixed metal oxide catalysts which are used by chemical manufacturers to effect partial oxidation reactions. Fe/Mo/0 catalyst systems are widely employed for the production of formaldehyde from methanol. Typically, a methanol-lean mixture of methanol and air is fed to a reactor operating near 350 C. Yields of over 90% based on the methanol fed can be obtained. While many scientific studies of these and other metal oxide catalysts have been carried out by researchers in catalysis, investigations of the fundamental chemical, physical and catalytic properties of the metal oxides used to effect partial oxidation reactions have not been nearly as plentiful as the corresponding studies of metallic *Present address: Westvaco, Laurel, MD. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 334 catalysts. Not surprisingly, the major thrust of industrial research has been toward the development and optimization of commercial catalysts. The accumulation of practical knowledge concerning selective oxidation reactions over mixed metal oxide catalysts has far outdistanced a basic understanding of the molecular phenomena involved in reactions over these materials. Consequently, a research program was initiated to investigate the effects of variations in the preparation procedure on the properties of the finished catalyst. Companion papers describe the results of studies involving the use of Raman spectroscopy to probe the events occurring in the genesis of both unsupported (bulk) catalysts [1] and catalysts supported on silica and alumina [2]. These papers also review the literature relevant to the present research effort. The present paper focuses on the results of a series of studies in which Raman spectroscopy was used to obtain in situ spectra of both supported and unsupported catalysts under reaction and redox conditions.

All spectra were recorded at a resolution of 5cm~1 (365 micron slit width, 20 mm slit height) and a step size of 1.5 cm\"1 per datum. The collection time and the number of scans were adjusted as appropriate to obtain quality spectra. Materials The catalysts were prepared using techniques described in companion papers [1, 2]. All reagents employed were chemically pure grade or better. In situ sample cells and reactors The flow reactor system shown in Fig. 1 was constructed to permit in situ collection of Raman spectra under steady state reaction conditions and to allow simultaneous kinetic studies. A flow system rather than a batch system was required because of the high rate of the oxidation reaction relative to the rate at which typical Raman spectra can be obtained. The special cell designed for use with the rotating lens assembly of the Raman spectrometer system is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The design permits a Raman spectrum of a catalyst sample to be collected while gas is passed through it. The cell is constructed of quartz to allow it to be heated above 500 C by the 400 watt nichrome wire heater which uses a Variac 5b 12 10 5o Fig. 2.

A thermocouple well is included so the temperature in this cell can also be controlled with an Omega temperature controller. Using this cell, one can simultaneously obtain both kinetic and spectral data. Because of the low flow rates required, methanol was introduced into the system through a saturator. Several research groups have previously utilized this method of introducing methanol [7-9]. The methanol concentra- tion in the feed was adjusted by varying the temperature of the vaporizer bath and/or adjusting the flow rate through the bypass line around the saturator. A Haake F3-K refrigerated constant temperature bath was used to control the saturator temperature. All lines down-stream from the saturator were heated with heating tape to prevent condensation of methanol. For the experiments reported here, the feed stream consisted of 5% methanol, 22% oxygen and 73% helium. Results and discussion In situ studies of bulk (unsupported) catalysts In an effort to elucidate the changes that occur on the surface of Fe Mo 0 catalysts during the partial oxidation of methanol, in situ Raman spectra of a bulk Fe/Mo/0 catalyst were collected under reaction conditions. The reaction was carried out at 275 C in the Raman flow cell shown in Fig. 2. Chromatographic analysis of the effluent stream indicated that the primary products were formaldehyde and water, but that traces of dimethyl ether, methyl formate and methylal were also present. Figure 3 contains spectra of the catalyst collected under various conditions. Spectrum A is that of the catalyst at 20 C in air before exposure to reaction conditions. Spectrum B pertains to the same catalyst heated to 275 C in air, and spectrum C to the catalyst under reaction conditions. Comparison of spectra B and A indicates that, on heating the absolute Raman intensity of the spectrum decreased by a factor of four and the relative intensity of the shoulder at 370 cm\"1 decreased somewhat. No other significant changes in the spectrum were detected. Spectrum C is characteristic of the bulk catalyst under reaction conditions. As evidenced by comparison of spectra B and C, the band locations and relative peak intensities in the Raman spectrum of a heated catalyst sample did not change when the catalyst was placed under reaction conditions. This result might lead one to conclude that the catalyst does not change when it is placed under reaction conditions. However, it is more likely that there were changes occurring on the catalyst surface that could not be detected by Raman spectroscopy. The bulk catalysts have a strong Raman spectrum which would tend to mask any weak scattered light signals resulting from vibrational transitions of catalyst/reactant surface species. Raman spectra for the catalyst under reaction conditions contained no 337 800 400 RAMAN SHIFT (cm1) Fig. 3. Raman spectra of an unsupported iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst.

Moreover, the spectra collected under reaction conditions did not contain any peaks characteristic of formaldehyde. The Raman spectra of bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts under reaction conditions did not appear to contain any bands which would be characteristic of surface species. At a given temperature, the intensities of the Raman spectra of Fe/Mo/0 catalysts seem to be related to the extent to which the catalysts are reduced. In general, a fully oxidized catalyst is a stronger Raman scatterer than a reduced catalyst. Small changes in the alignment of a sample placed in a Raman spectrometer can cause large changes in the scattered light intensity. Therefore, only large changes in the absolute Raman scattering intensity of a sample can generally be interpreted as being significant. However, since spectra B and C were collected from the sample without realignment of the Raman spectrometer, it is possible to compare in a meaningful manner the absolute intensities of the two spectra. Spectrum C has an intensity which is only 60% of that of spectrum B. This result leads one to the conclusion that the catalyst is partially reduced under actual reaction conditions. 338 After 4 h use in the flow reactor cell, the color of the catalyst sample had changed from pale yellow-green to blue-green. This color change was indicative of a chemical change in the solid catalyst. However, the Raman spectrum of this used catalyst (collected at 20 C in air) was identical to the spectrum of the fresh unused catalyst under the same conditions. In earlier experiments it was discovered that two iron oxides (FeO and FegOa) are very weak Raman scatterers and do not produce any significant Raman bands. Therefore, the possibility that the color change was caused by some change in the environment of the iron atoms to which the Raman spectrum was not sensitive was considered. In order to test this hypothesis, Mossbauer spectra of the samples were collected. The Mossbauer spectra of the used and fresh catalysts were identical. Both had only a single peak, indicating the presence of Fe\"^3 in an octahedral environment. It is possible that the bulk of the catalyst was unaltered and that the color change was due to some surface phenomena to which neither Raman nor Mossbauer spectra are sensitive. However, catalyst samples which varied in bulk properties (e.g. the ratio of molybdenum to iron) also had identical Mossbauer spectra. Mossbauer spectra of catalysts with Mo/Fe atomic ratios ranging from 1 to 3 indicated that the iron was present only as Fe'1\"3 in an octahedral environment. Iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1 are black in color, while catalysts with a ratio of 3 are pale yellow. Raman spectra of catalyst samples with Mo/Fe ratios from 1 to 1.5 all displayed the same band locations and relative peak intensities. These spectra are characteristic of Fea(Mo04)3. The Raman spectra of catalysts with Mo/Fe atomic ratios less than 1.5 differed only in their absolute Raman intensities. As the Mo/Fe ratio was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 the Raman intensity decreased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. This decrease could be due, in part, to the black color of the sample with a Mo/Fe ratio of one. Catalysts with a Mo/Fe ratio less than 1.5 have an excess of iron with respect to that needed for the formation of stoichiometric Fe2(Mo04)3. It is thought that the 'excess' iron forms an Fe^Oa phase in the solid catalyst. As noted above, iron oxide is a very weak Raman scatterer and does not add a significant contribution to the Raman spectrum. Therefore, one would expect catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios less than 1.5 to have similar spectra. The dilution of the Raman-active Fea(Mo04)3 by FegOs in catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios less than 1.5 undoubtedly contributes to the reduction in the Raman intensity of their spectra. Catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios greater than the 1.5 ratio required for the formation of stoichiometric FegCMoO^a had additional peaks, which are attributed to the formation of a MoOa phase in the solid catalyst. The relative intensities of these MoOa peaks increased as the amount of 'excess' Mo was increased. In situ studies of supported catalysts Fe/Mo/0 catalysts supported on silica gel were prepared in an attempt to improve the probability of observing catalyst surface features using 339 Raman spectroscopy. The rationale behind this experiment was that the strong Raman signal from the bulk catalysts made it impossible to see surface features on the bulk catalysts. It was hoped that supporting the catalyst on a weak Raman scatterer like silica gel would virtually eliminate the bulk phase, leaving only surface species to contribute to the spectrum. In situ Raman spectra of an Fe/Mo/0 catalyst supported on silica gel were collected under reaction conditions similar to those used for the bulk catalyst. The reaction was carried out at 275 C in the Raman flow cell shown in Fig. 2. As with the bulk catalysts, the observed products were primarily formaldehyde and water, but traces of dimethyl ether, methyl formate and methylal were also present in the product stream. Figure 4 contains Raman spectra of the catalyst obtained under various conditions. Spectrum A is that of the catalyst at 20 C in air before the reaction was carried out. Spectrum B pertains to the same catalyst heated to 275 C in air, and spectrum C to the same catalyst under reaction conditions. Comparison of spectra A and B in Fig. 4 indicates that, as the catalyst was heated, a fluorescence background developed. This fluorescence did not 800 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm1) Fig. 4.

There is not yet complete agreement on the source of fluorescence. Klaassen [10] has reviewed many of the investigations of this phenomenon. Comparison of spectra A and B reveals that, upon heating, the Raman signal strength decreased. This behavior is similar to that observed for the bulk catalyst. As with the bulk catalyst, heating the supported catalyst in air did not cause shifts or changes in the relative peak intensities of the Raman bands in the spectrum. Spectrum C in Fig. 4 indicates that there are no apparent changes in the spectrum when the supported catalyst is placed under reaction conditions. This Raman spectrum does not contain any bands which can be attributed to surface species involved as participants or intermediates in the partial oxidation reaction. In situ Raman studies of redox processes involving an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst Some form of FegdMoC^a, either a normal ferric molybdate [11] or an iron-deficient ferric molybdate [12], is thought to be the active component of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. The oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde over Fe/Mo/0 catalysts occurs through a redox mechanism in which lattice oxygen is extracted from the catalyst [9]. Methanol has been found to reduce ferric molybdate to ferrous molybdate at temperatures above 230 C [13]. Therefore, information about ferrous as well as ferric molybdate is of interest. It is also important to obtain information about the interactions of the oxidized catalyst with methanol and the reduced catalyst with oxygen. Consequently, a series of in situ studies of unsupported Fe/Mo/0 catalysts was undertaken. A sample of an unsupported catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7 was placed in a batch reactor cell connected to a vacuum rack. At room temperature (24 C) the sample was exposed to air, evacuated, and finally exposed to 100 torr of methanol. In situ Raman spectra of the sample under each atmosphere were collected. No changes in the Raman spectrum or the physical appearance of the catalyst were found for these three conditions. The fact that the Raman spectrum of the catalyst did not change when methanol was introduced indicates that methanol does not interact strongly with this catalyst at room temperature. The two spectra denoted by the letter A in Figs. 5 and 6 are characteristic of the sample at room temperature. Figures 5 and 6 display the same sequence of spectra on different scales. In Fig. 5 the spectra are all plotted using the same absolute intensity scale. In Fig. 6 the scales of the weaker spectra are greatly enlarged in order to reveal spectral details. After the three aforementioned room temperature spectra were col- lected, the sample was heated to 113 C under 200 torr of oxygen and another spectrum was collected. The absolute intensity of the Raman scattering from the sample under oxygen at 113 C was approximately half that of the room temperature specrum, but the spectrum of the sample was otherwise 341 B __ ^ Fig. 5. /n site Raman spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst heated in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres.

The sample was then evacuated and 100 torr of methanol was introduced with the catalyst temperature held constant at 113 C. The in situ Raman spectrum collected under these conditions is indicated by the letter B in Figs. 5 and 6. Comparison of spectra B and A (collected with the catalyst exposed to air at 24 C) reveals that there are no changes in the peak locations or relative band intensities resulting from the exposure of the catalyst to a methanol atmosphere at 113 C. However, there was a three-fold reduction in the absolute intensity of the spectrum collected at 113 C under a methanol atmosphere, relative to that of the spectrum recorded (but not shown in Figs. 5 and 6) at the same temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. The absolute Raman scattering intensity of a sample can vary by as much as 50% due to small changes in the alignment of a sample. However, small changes in absolute intensities can be significant if the spectra are collected from a single sample under different conditions without realign- ment. At a given temperature, the intensities of the Raman spectra of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts are thought to be related to the extent to which the catalysts are reduced. A fully oxidized catalyst is a stronger Raman scatterer than a reduced catalyst. Therefore, the reduction in the intensity of the Raman spectrum which was detected when 100 torr of methanol was introduced at 113 C is believed to be an indication that the sample was slightly reduced by methanol at this temperature. No change in the physical appearance of the catalyst was detected. The catalyst sample was then heated to 300 C under 360 torr of oxygen. Spectrum C in Figs 5 and 6 indicates that this change in conditions caused a small reduction in the relative intensity of the 992 cm\"1 peak. Increases in the intensity of this band have been associated with increases in the MoOa content of the catalyst. Since other peaks which are associated with the presence of molybdenum trioxide have not undergone a similar reduction in relative intensity, the slight reduction in the relative intensity of this peak does not necessarily indicate a corresponding reduction in the molybdenum trioxide concentration. The absolute intensity of the Raman spectrum collected at 300 C under 360 torr of oxygen was similar in magnitude to that of the spectrum collected at 113 C under 200 torr of oxygen and was three times greater than that of the spectrum collected at 113 C under 100 torr of methanol. The intensities of Raman spectra of catalyst samples usually decrease with increasing temperature. Hence, this result indicates that the catalyst sample was probably fully reoxidized by the exposure to oxygen at 300 C. The catalyst sample was then evacuated while maintaining the temperature at 300 C. Spectrum D in Figs. 5 and 6 is that of the sample under vacuum at 300 C. There were no significant changes in the band locations or relative peak intensities caused by evacuation of the sample. However, the intensity of the Raman signal decreased by an order of magnitude. The drastic reduction in intensity indicates that a greater reduction of the sample was caused by evacuation at 300 C than was caused 343 by exposure to methanol at 113 C. After spectrum D was collected, 100 torr of methanol was introduced to the sample chamber. As a result of this exposure to methanol, the catalyst turned from a pale green-yellow color to a solid black. The Raman spectrum of this sample is labeled by the letter E in Figs. 5 and 6. As shown in these spectra, the intensity of the Raman scattering from this reduced catalyst was obscured by the background noise level in the instrument. Highly colored samples are known to produce poor Raman spectra. However, the loss of signal strength could also be due to the reduced form of the catalyst being a poor Raman scatterer. Next, the sample cell was evacuated and 200 torr of oxygen was introduced. The sample remained black in color. However, the spectrum labeled F in Fig. 6 indicates that the Raman spectrum of the catalyst changed upon introduction of oxygen. Although the spectrum is not that of a fully oxidized catalyst, it does have bands at 816 and 782cm\"1 which are characteristic of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. The absolute intensity of Spectrum F is only 19% of that of the spectrum of the fully oxidized catalyst under oxygen at 300 C. Spectrum G in Figs. 5 and 6 characterizes the reduced and reoxidized catalyst after it had cooled to room temperature and had been exposed to air. The sharp bands in spectrum G can be all attributed to MoOa. Iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts usually have a Mo/Fe atom ratio greater than the ratio of 1.5, which corresponds to that of stoichiometric FeztMoO^s. It is believed that any molybdenum present in excess of that needed to form Fe2(MoC>4)3 forms a MoOa phase in the solid catalyst. Spectrum G indicates that the MoOs phase in the catalyst is more readily reoxidized than is the Fez(Mo04)3 phase. If the aforementioned treatment of this sample had preferentially reoxidized FeaCMoO^a rather than MoOa, one would expect a spectrum similar to Spectrum A, which is that of the fully oxidized catalyst. The reduced and reoxidized catalyst sample was removed from the in situ Raman cell and placed in a calcining oven at 500 C. After 8 h at 500 C the sample was removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature. The original pale yellow-green color of the catalyst sample was restored by the calcination treatment. Spectrum H in Figs. 5 and 6 was collected after this calcination treatment, and is identical to spectrum A (the spectrum of the catalyst sample before it was subjected to a reduction and reoxidation cycle). Since the catalyst sample was successfully restored to its original conditions, the reduction process to which the catalyst sample was subjected can be viewed as reversible. Effect of reduction and reoxidation on the Roman spectrum in the region from 1000 to 2000cm -i The Raman spectrum of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst in the region from 50-2200 cm\"1 is shown in Fig. 7. Spectrum B in Fig. 7 is actually spectrum A replotted with the intensity scale enlarged 66 times. After a cursory inspection of spectrum A in Fig. 7, one might conclude that there were no spectral features above 1000 cm~1. However, inspection of spectrum 344 1000 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 7.

(A) at room temperature in air; (B) same spectrum with intensity scale enlarged by a factor of 66. Sample cell: rotating lens with in situ reactor cell. B reveals that some very weak bands are present in the high wavenumber region. The strong bands in the wavenumber region below 1000 cm\"1 arise from the fundamental vibrational modes of the catalyst. The region above 1000 cm\"1 contains bands which are characteristic of overtone and combina- tion transitions. For example, the last overtone peak at 1984 cm~1 appears at exactly twice the wavenumber shift of the last fundamental peak at 992 cm~1. There were no bands found above the overtone peak at 1984 cm~1. Figure 8 depicts the high wavenumber region of some of the Raman spectra displayed in Figs. 5 and 6. Spectrum A in Fig. 8 shows the high wavenumber region for the fresh catalyst in air at room temperature. As was the case for the fundamental region of the spectrum, exposure of the sample to oxygen, vacuum or methanol at room temperature (or at 113 C) did not result in any changes in the band locations or relative peak intensities in the overtone region. Changes in the absolute Raman intensity similar to those observed in the low wavenumber region were also observed in the high wavenumber region. Spectrum C in Fig. 8 is that of the sample under 360 torr of oxygen at 300 C. Under these conditions it was no longer possible to resolve the broad band centered at 1935 cm~1 into two peaks. As the temperature is increased, the intensity of the Raman spectrum of a bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst decreases. The ability to resolve the spectral features into separate peaks is also slightly reduced when the sample is heated. These effects have also been reported for the Raman spectra of bismuth molybdate catalysts [4]. Spectrum H in Fig. 8 is the high wavenumber region and corresponds to 345 Fig. 8.

Sample Cell: rotating lens with ire situ reactor cell. spectrum H in Figs. 5 and 6. Spectrum H was recorded after the sample, which was subjected to in situ reduction and reoxidation cycles, was removed from the Raman instrument, calcined at 500 C for 8h and cooled to room temperature. Comparison of spectrum A, which characterizes the fresh catalyst prior to the in situ reduction/reoxidation treatments, with spectrum H reveals that there are no significant differences between these spectra. These spectra cover only the wavenumber region from 1000 to 2200cm\"1. However, the same result was found for the wavenumber region from 50 to 1100 cm\"1 in Figs. 5 and 6. Thus, it appears that the calcination treatment restores the catalyst to its original condition. Spectrum D in Fig. 8 depicts the overtone region of the sample under vacuum at 300 C. Upon evacuation at temperatures greater than 200 C, the sample gives a characteristic overtone spectrum which is greatly reduced in intensity and which contains a broad band centered at 1580 cm\"1. Spectrum E corresponds to that of the catalyst sample under 100 torr of methanol at 300 C. Under these conditions both the characteristic fundamental and overtone bands disappeared, leaving only the broad band at 1580cm\"1. 346 Several speculative assignments of the 1580 cm\"1 band are possible. One reasonable hypothesis is that it is associated with some form of graphitic carbon, perhaps deposited by pyrolytic decomposition of methanol. Tuinstra and Koenig [14, 15] have reported that the Raman spectrum of a graphite single crystal consists of a single sharp line at 1575cm\"1. Coal [16, 17] and other forms of carbon [15, 18-19] have also been reported as giving rise to Raman spectra with broad features near 1580 cm~1. Several researchers have attributed this band to the graphitic forms of carbon. Complete reduction of a catalyst with methanol There are three forms of ferrous molybdate: a low-temperature, low pressure form (a-FeMo04), a high-temperature, low pressue form (fS- FeMoC>4), and a high-pressure form (FeMo04-II) [20, 21]. Both the a and ft forms have been found in the reduced phase of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. Burriesci et al. [22] reported that if a methanol atmosphere is initially contacted with the catalyst at room temperature and then the whole system is heated to 310 C, a-FeMo04 is obtained. If, on the other hand, the system is heated to 310 C and then methanol is introduced, ^3-FeMo04 is obtained. Both of these procedures for producing ferrous molybdate were tried in this laboratory. A sample of a catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.5 was placed in the in situ Raman flow cell. The sample was then exposed to a flowing stream of pure helium and heated to 305 C. Once thermal equilibrium was reached, 4% methanol by volume was added to the helium stream. Raman spectra were collected before the sample was heated, before methanol was introduced, and after methanol was introduced. The results were similar to those described for the in situ batch reactor experiment discussed above. As in the case of the spectra shown in Fig. 5, the absolute intensity of the Raman spectrum decreased upon heating, but the spectrum was otherwise unchanged. Intro- duction of methanol at temperatures around 300 C results in the disap- pearance of the Raman bands which are characteristic of Fea(Mo04)3 and MoOa. The sample was held overnight at 305 C under the flowing mixture of methanol and helium. This flow was maintained while the sample was cooled to room temperature. Spectrum C in Fig. 9 pertains to this sample at room temperature. Except for a 5 temperature difference (305 C instead of 310 C) the procedure outlined by Burriesci et al. [22] was followed. Therefore, this reduced catalyst should have been /?-FeMo04. Another sample of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst was placed in the Raman flow cell. This time the sample was placed under helium-methanol flow before being heated to 305 C. The sample was left at 305 C for 3.5 h. Then the sample was cooled to room temperature while the helium methanol flow was maintained. According to Burriesci et al. [22], this sample should have formed af-FeMo04. Spectrum D in Fig. 9 is the Raman spectrum of this reduced catalyst at room temperature. The spectra of the reduced catalysts were very weak. A fully oxidized catalyst typically has a spectrum with a maximum intensity from 20 000 to 347 16001200800400 6 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 9.

The spectra of these reduced catalyst samples had a maximum peak to trough signal level of only 40 photon counts per second. The photomultiplier tube in the Raman spectrometer is rated as having a noise level of less than 30 photon counts per second. Therefore, the Raman scattering from these samples was just barely stronger than the noise level in the photomultiplier tube. The narrow sharp peak appearing at 1557 cm\"1 in spectra C and D is a non-lasing plasma line from the argon ion laser. All of the sharp lines which appear below 360 cm\"1 in these spectra are also plasma lines. A narrow band interference filter is used to remove the plasma lines from the incident laser beam. For most Raman spectra, the filter does an adequate job of removing the plasma lines. However, the filtered plasma lines are still comparable in magnitude to the Raman scattered light from very weak Raman scatterers like these reduced catalyst samples. The filter is less effective near the exciting line; therefore, this problem becomes worse below 360 cm\"1. A comparison of spectra C and D reveals that the only significant 348 difference between them is that spectrum D has a peak at 782 cm~1 which is greater in magnitude than that of spectrum C. Spectrum A in Fig. 9 characterizes the catalyst before it was reduced. Spectrum B is spectrum A plotted at 77 times the scale of spectrum A. The most intense peak in the fresh fully oxidized catalyst appears at 782cm\"1. The sample depicted in spectrum D was exposed to a reducing atmosphere for 3.5 h while the sample depicted in spectrum C was exposed to a reducing atmosphere overnight (approximately 10 h). Therefore, it is conceivable that the more intense peak at 782 cm\"1 in spectrum D is a result of incomplete reduction of the sample. The oxidized catalyst has a Raman signal strength which is 1000 times greater than that of the reduced catalyst. Thus a very small fraction of oxidized catalyst left in the reduced sample would have a signal strength comparable to that of the reduced catalyst. An alternative explanation for the difference between spectra C and D was also considered. The sample in spectrum D was supposed to be (y-FeMo04 while that in spectrum C was supposed to be ^-FeMo04. Therefore, the difference between the two spectra could be a result of two different crystal structures. This latter explanation was considered unlikely. Raman spectra of these compounds were not found in the literature. In order to ascertain whether two different phases of FeMoC>4 were formed, Mossbauer spectra of these samples were collected. The Mossbauer spectra of the two reduced catalyst samples and that of a fully oxidized sample are presented in Fig. 10. Spectrum A is that of the fully oxidized catalyst. It displays a single well-defined absorption line with an isomer shift of 0.43 mm s~1 which is characteristic of high spin ferric ions in octahedral coordination. Spectrum C is that of the sample which was exposed to methanol before heating while spectrum B is that of the sample which was heated before exposure to methanol. Recall that, if the prepara- tion procedure ofBurriesci et al. [22] is employed, the sample in spectrum C was expected to be o-FeMo04, while the sample in spectrum B was expected to be /?-FeMo04. Neither of the two Mossbauer spectra are characteristic of a pure phase of FeMo04. Therefore, we are unable to replicate the results of Burriesci et al. [22]. o'-FeMo04 is characterized at room temperature by a Mossbauer spectrum containing only one quadroupole doublet, while the spectrum of ^-FeMo04 contains four absorption lines. Sleight et al. [20] have reported an isomer shift of 0.86 mm S\"1 and a quadrupole splitting of 1.52 mm s~1 for ar-FeMo04. They also reported the following parameters for the two doublets of ^-FeMoOl: an isomer shift of 0.9 mm s~1 and a quadrupole splitting of 2.6mms~1; an isomer shift of l.Omms\"1 and a quadrupole splitting of 0.9 nuns\"1. An attempt was made to fit the Mossbauer spectra in Fig. 10 with Lorentzian lineshapes using a least squares fitting program. It was assumed that only various forms of iron molybdate [a-FeMo04, j8-FeMoC>4 and Fe2(Mo04)s] could be present. Therefore, the parameters reported by Sleight et al. were used as initial guesses for the fitting program. Both spectra of the 349 VELOCITI (an/a) Pig. i0.

(A) folly oxidized Fe^MoO^a; (B) sample A reduced by heating to 310 C, then introducing C^OH; (C) sample A reduced by introducing CHgOH, then heating to 310 C. The spectra were collected at room temperature in air. The source was \"Co in an iron matrix. Metallic iron foil was used for calibration of the zero velocity. reduced samples could be fit by addition of the singlet which is characteristic of Fea(Mo04)3 to the four absorption lines of fi-FeMoO^. It was possible to also add the doublet which characterizes o'-FeMo04 without an adverse affect on the fit. The presence of the high pressure modification (FeMo04-II) was considered unlikely. Therefore, no attempt was made to fit lines which are characteristic of FeMo04-II. The spectra could not be fit by addition of the absorption band of Fe^MoO^s to the doublet of a a-feMoO^. Nor could the spectra be fit by lines characteristic of a-FeMo04 and ^-FeMo04 alone. Therefore, one can conclude that the reduced samples must have contained ^-FeMo04 and Fe2(MoC>4)3. No definite conclusion can be drawn with regard to the presence or absence of a-FeMo04. There is a small shoulder at - 0.58 mm s~1 in spectrum C of Fig. 10. This line is not accounted for by the presence of any of the aforementioned iron molybdate compounds. Therefore, about 1% of the sample in spectrum C remains unidentified. 350 It remains to be determined why the attempts to manufacture a- and fS-FeMoO^ by the procedure described by Burriesci et al. [22] were unsuc- cessful. The Mossbauer spectra of reduced catalysts which Burriesci et al. published were collected at elevated temperatures. Carbucicchio and Trifiro [13] have found that \"the changes which occur within the catalyst that interacted at high temperature with methanol are not influenced by decreas- ing the temperature to room temperature\". Based on their results, cooling the reduced catalyst to room temperature should not alter the Mossbauer spectra of the reduced samples. The temperature which Burriesci et al. specified was 5 C higher than that used in this laboratory (310 C instead of 305 C). The lower tempera- ture could affect the production of/?-FeMo04 which was shown to be present in the reduced samples from this laboratory. However, Burriesci et al. completely reduced FegCMoO^a to (y-FeMo04 at temperatures as low as 270 C. Therefore, the lower temperature should not have inhibited the production of a-FeMo04. The presence of (y-FeMo04 was not confirmed in the reduced samples from this laboratory. Burriesci et al. reported that they achieved complete reduction of Fez(Mo04)3 to a- or /?-FeMo04 after about 2 h of treatment. The samples prepared in this laboratory were treated for a minimum of 3.5 h. Therefore, the length of the treatment should have been sufficient for complete oxidation. The Mossbauer spectra of the reduced catalysts produced in this laboratory provided evidence for the presence of Fe2(Mo04)3. It is clear that these samples were either never fully reduced or were partially reoxidized. Reoxidation of FeMo04 to Fe2(Mo04)3 occurs only at temperatures above 180 C [22]. The samples in question were cooled under a flowing mixture of methanol and helium. Therefore, there should have been no contact of the samples with oxygen while at elevated temperatures. Although tests perfor- med during the experiments indicated that there were no leaks in the flow system, the possibility remains that oxygen from the atmosphere could have leaked into the flow system. Conclusions Hainan spectra of both bulk and supported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts were collected in situ under reaction conditions. Catalyst samples having Mo/Fe atomic ratios of 1.7 and 3.0 were employed in a fixed bed reactor. No changes in band locations or relative peak intensities were detected in Raman spectra of the catalysts obtained under reaction condi- tions. Moreover, no spectral features which would indicate the presence of methanol, formaldehyde or any adsorbed surface species were observed. When methanol was present in the feed stream, there was a reduction of approximately 40% in the absolute intensity of the Raman spectrum. At a given temperature the intensities of the Raman spectra ofFe/Mo/0 catalysts 351 were related to the extent to which the catalysts were reduced. Since a fully oxidized catalyst is a stronger Raman scatterer than a partially reduced catalyst, the reduction in intensity was viewed as evidence for partial reduction of the catalyst under reaction conditions. Catalysts which had been used in the reactor were found to have changed color from a pale yellow-green to a blue-green. This color change is indicative of a chemical change in the solid catalyst. However, the Raman and Mossbauer spectra of used catalysts were identical to those of the fresh unused catalysts. Experiments were also performed in which catalyst samples were reduced by exposure to methanol in the absence of oxygen. Raman spectra collected ire situ during a reduction experiment indicated that methanol does not interact strongly with the catalyst at room temperature. At 110 C a decrease in the absolute intensity of the catalyst spectrum upon introduction of methanol was taken as an indication that the sample was slightly reduced by the methanol. At 300 C evacuation of the sample resulted in a much larger decrease in the absolute intensity of the catalyst spectrum. This result indicated that a greater reduction of the catalyst sample had occurred. When 100 ton\" of methanol was introduced at 300 C, the sample turned from a pale green-yellow color to solid black. The Raman scattering from this reduced catalyst was so weak that it was obscured by the background noise level in the instrument. The growth of Fez(Mo04)3 bands in the ire situ Raman spectra upon the introduction of 200 ton\" of oxygen indicated that the introduction of oxygen at 300 C caused a partial reoxidation of the sample. The spectrum of the sample after it had been cooled to room temperature was dominated by bands characteristic of MoOg. This result indicated that the MoC>3 phase in the catalyst is more readily reoxidized than the FegCMoO^a phase. The catalyst was restored to its original fully oxidized condition by calcination at 500 C.
