Gadgil, R. Sasikala and S.K. Kulahreshtha* Chemistry Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Bombay-400 085 (India) (Received April 6,1993; accepted August 26,1993 ) Abstract Oxidation of CO over the surface of Sn02 and Pd/Sn02 catalysts has been investigated with a view to understand the role of Pd metal particles which are known to improve the catalytic activity. The reaction occurs through the incorporation of lattice oxygen and an oxidized surface of the catalyst facilitates the CO oxidation. For Pd/Sn02 significant CO oxidation occurs even at room temperature as monitored by CO pulse injection technique. Disproportionation of CO into COZ and carbon has been observed in the region 350 K 5 TS 425 K. From l'9Sn Mosabauer investigations the existence of Sn2+ species in the support matrix has been observed and its extent is affected by Pd incorporation. The effect of oxygen and/or hydrogen pretreatment of Pd/Sn02 catalyst at different temperatures on its catalytic activity has been discussed. Key words: carbon monoxide; oxidation; palladium; atannia; supported catalyst Introduction Low temperature catalytic oxidation of CO has attracted the attention of a large number of research workers because of its significance in closed-cycle COZ lasers and environmental pollution control processes as is apparent from the number of review articles [ 1-8 ] published during the past few years and a variety of reaction mechanisms proposed by different authors. Generally the oxides having variable oxidation state of metal ions, with and without impregnation of noble metal (such as Pd, Pt, Au, etc.), have been found to be active catalysts for this reaction. For oxides, without impregnation of noble metal, CO oxidation occurs through redox mechanism and lattice oxygen incorporation takes place during CO oxidation and the reduced surface of metal oxide is rejuvenated by taking oxygen from the feed mixture. For noble metal incorporated oxide catalysts, the CO oxidation occurs at relatively lower temperatures and a variety of suggestions have been made to explain this enhancement in catalytic activity at relatively lower temperatures, such as: (i) the activation of both CO and oxygen over the metal surface and spillover of these activated *Corresponding author.

Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 species to the support oxide [9]; (ii) the energy released during the chemisorption of CO and oxygen over the metal sites may give rise to localized temperature increase and thereby enhance the catalytic activity as reported for Pd supported on non-reducible oxides like Si02, A1203, MgO, etc. [ 10, 11 ] ; (iii) disproportionation of CO to carbon andC02on particles of metal [ 12-15 ]; (iv) recombination of chemisorbed CO and atomic oxygen over the surface of the metal [ 16-18 ]; and (v) the reaction of chemisorbed atomic or molecular oxygen with the CO molecules present in the gas phase [ 19-21 ] . Pd/Sn02and Pt/Sn02are interesting catalyst systems for CO oxidation because of the synergistic effect [22-24]. The order of the reaction and the apparent activation energy for CO oxidation over Pd/Sn02catalyst have been found to be quite different from those observed for polycrystalline Pd (or Pd/ Si02and Pd/A1203) and Sn02individually. Bond et al. [ 9 ] suggested that the spillover of both CO and atomic oxygen from metal sites to the support Sn02 is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. These authors also suggested that -2% Pd concentration is sufficient to cover the entire surface of Sn02. In contrast Sheintuch et al. [ 23 ] in a recent study suggested that the spillover of only CO is responsible for the synergistic effects and oxygen spillover is not consistent with their observations. Matolin et al. [ 25 ] on the other hand, have provided evidence for the partial disproportionation of CO on the surface of unsupported Pd and the formation of surface carbon as an intermediate species during the steady state CO oxidation process. The role of surface hydroxyl species during CO oxidation also has been emphasized by some authors [26, 27 ] . On the basis of microcalorimetry measurements Gangal et al. [ 28 ] have suggested that lattice oxygen plays an important role at all temperatures of reaction and the localized heat produced in the vicinity of metal sites due to chemisorption of the gases enhances the yield of Mover Pt/Sn02catalyst. Thus there is some controversy about the mechanism of CO oxidation over Pt or Pd/Sn02and further investigations are desirable. In the present communication we report the CO oxidation results on Sn02 and Pd/Sn02 catalyst samples which provide direct evidence for the lattice oxygen incorporation during CO oxidation over both Sn02and Pd/Sn02and the disproportionation of CO over the metal surface of Pd/Sn02catalyst even at less than 375 K. Experimental Sn02gel was prepared by precipitating hydrous tin oxide from SnC14 solution at 275 K using aqueous ammonia. The precipitated gel was washed and centrifuged repeatedly and finally dried at room temperature. The material thus obtained was redispersed in water to break large granules, filtered and again dried at room temperature followed by heating at 475 K. The powder Xray diffraction pattern of the sample was found to be characteristic of tetra- M.M. Gadgil et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 299 gonal rutile structure with very broad diffraction peaks due to poor crystallinity. The 40-80 mesh fraction of Sn02 particles having a surface area of -150 m2 g-1 was used to impregnate 2% (by weight) palladium on its surface using PdC12 solution. The impregnated sample was dried at - 425 K. The impregnated palladium chloride was reduced to palladium metal by heating in flowing hydrogen gas at 375 K for 2 h in-situ before the CO oxidation experiments. The catalytic reaction was carried out using pulse injection method after giving the desired pretreatment to 0.5 g catalyst placed in the tubular stainless steel reactor with 0.4 mm i.d. The effluent gases were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Porapak Q column using thermal conductivity detector. One of the following pretreatments was carried out on the catalyst: (i) heating at 625 K for 2 h in helium flow; (ii) heating at 625 K for 2 h in oxygen flow, followed by heating in helium at 625 K for 2 h to remove the adsorbed oxygen; or (iii) heating in hydrogen flow at 525 K for 2 h, followed by heating in helium at 625 K for 2 h to remove the chemisorbed hydrogen from metal surface. After such pretreatments, the catalyst sample was cooled to room temperature in helium stream. The CO oxidation reaction was carried out at variable temperatures by injecting 100A pulse of either CO or (CO+O2) (1:1) gas mixture under helium flow of 30 ml min-1. The catalyst samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XO) and 11aSn Mosabauer spectroscopy to monitor the changes in crystallinity and oxidation state of Sn during the catalytic reaction. 11sSn Mossbauer spectra were recorded in an in situ cell at room temperature after different pretreatments. The source used was Ba11sSn03 and the absorber contained approximately 0.5 mg 11sSn/cm2. These spectra were fitted by least squares using Lorentzian line shape to get the values of various Mosabauer parameters and to infer about the nature of the catalyst. Results Figure 1 shows the results of CO oxidation over the surface of plain Sn02 catalyst after treating it in helium or oxygen at 625 K for 2 h when 100 #l pulses of either CO or (CO + OZ) had been injected over the surface of the catalyst at variable temperatures. From this figure, three important inferences can be drawn: (i) There is no adsorption or chemisorption of unreacted CO over the surface of Sn02 catalyst at reaction temperature (450 K::9 TS 775 K) as can be seen from Fig. 1 (b, b', c and c' ). (ii) The lattice oxygen is being used for CO oxidation as is apparent from complete conversion of CO to CO2 (Fig. 1 (b and c) ). (iii) Pretreatment of the catalyst by oxygen or addition of oxygen to the reaction gas mixture facilitates the oxidation of CO to CO2 over the surface of Sn02 as can be seen from the \"lit-off 'temperature of the reaction in Fig. 1 (a,bandc).

The yields of unreacted CO corresponding to (b) and (c) are shown in (b') and (c' ). catalyst after different types of pretreatments have been given to the catalyst. One of the important features of these curves is that in the region 350-425 K there is a clear discontinuity and decrease in the yield of COZ with increasing temperature of reaction, when pulses of CO or (CO + OZ) have been injected over Pd/Sn02 catalyst pretreated either in helium or oxygen followed by heating in helium. Such a clear discontinuity in the yield of C02 has not been reported earlier for Pd/Sn02 or Pt/Sn02 catalyst. Further, at lower temperatures, the total amount of COZ and unreacted CO eluted is not commensurate with the amount of CO injected over the catalyst as can be seen from Fig. 2 (b, b', c and c' ). Pd/Sn02 catalyst was found to work at much lower temperature as compared to what has been observed for Sn02. From the comparison of Fig. 2 (b, b', and c, c') it is observed that the oxygen pretreatment not only improved the yield of COZ but also the evolved unreacted CO was found to be more than that observed for the Pd/Sn02 catalyst heated in helium alone. Figure 2 (d) shows the percentage yield of COZ when 100#1 pulses of (CO + OZ ) mixture were injected over the Pd/Sn02 catalyst which has been first heated in oxygen at 625 K for 2 h followed by sequential heating in hydrogen (at 525 M.M.

Fig. 2 (e and e') show the percentage yield of C02 and unreacted CO over the same catalyst as in Fig. 2 (d) when only CO pulses were injected over the catalyst. Thus the behaviour of hydrogen treated catalyst sample is quite different from that observed for helium or oxygen pretreated catalyst. This observation is quite surprising as the hydrogen pretreatment is expected to generate clean Pd metal surface over which the chemisorption and disproportionation of CO should be enhanced and the discontinuity observed in the yield of COZ (viz. Fig. 2 (a, b and c) ), should have been more pronounced. Like plain Sn02, here also lattice oxygen is being incorporated during CO oxidation as can be seen from Fig. 2 (e) where only CO pulses have been injected over the reduced catalyst and complete conversion of CO to C02 has been observed. Similarly the presence of oxygen in the reactant gas mixture or an oxidized surface of Pd/Sn0z catalyst is found to facilitate the CO oxidation. As the hydrogen pretreated Pd/Sn02 catalyst behaved in a different manner for CO oxidation, detailed experiments were carried out for Pd/Sn02 cat- 302 MM. Gadgil et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 alyst after heating it in hydrogen at different temperatures between 375 to 525 K for a fixed duration of two hours. Figure 3 shows the results of percentage yield of C02 and unreacted CO when 100 ,u1 pulses of CO have been injected at variable temperatures. A clear discontinuity in the yield of C02 is observed for the catalyst sample pretreated in hydrogen at different temperatures. Further, the temperature region of the observed discontinuity in COZ yield is almost unaffected by hydrogen reduction of the catalyst at different temperatures. Heating Pd/Sn02 catalyst at higher temperature in hydrogen was found to slightly reduce the catalytic activity. Analysis of these data suggest that at lower temperatures there is imbalance in the amount of CO injected and eluted CO and C02. These results are different from what has been shown in Fig. 2 (e and e') . The possible reason for this could be the oxygen pretreatment given to the catalyst sample of Fig. 2 (d and e). In order to ascertain the role of oxygen pretreatment, Pd/Sn02 was first heated in oxygen (625 K, 2 h) followed by heating in helium at the same temperature for 2 h and cooled to room temperature and its catalytic activity was measured (Fig. 4(a)). The same catalyst was further heated in hydrogen (525 K, 2 h) and helium (625 K, 2 h) and cooled to room temperature in helium.

Comparison of these two curves shows that the oxygen pretreatment followed by hydrogen pretreatment significantly affects catalytic behaviour. The results of Fig. 4 (b ) are quite similar to what has been reported in Fig. 2 ( e ) under identical conditions. The results of repeated pretreatments in oxygen and hydrogen were found to be quite reproducible as can be seen from Fig. 4 where the results of the yield of C02 and the amount of unreacted CO are plotted. In order to further substantiate these observations, a fresh catalyst sample generated by heating in hydrogen at 375 K for 2 h was pretreated sequentially with oxygen and hydrogen similarly to that described above and the results of its catalytic activity for CO oxidation are plotted in Fig. 4 ( e ) which are qualitatively similar to what is observed in Fig. 4(b) and (d) where the hydrogen pretreatment was carried out at 525 K. In order to ascertain the formation of active carbon over the surface of Pd/Sn02 catalyst due to CO disproportionation at lower temperature, another set of experiments were carried out from 300 K to 475 K, in which after each CO pulse injection and subsequent to the elution of unreacted CO and product 304 MM Gadgil et al. / J. MOL Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 CO2, 80 y1 pulses of oxygen were injected and the yield of COZ was monitored. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 5, which clearly establishes the formation of COZ between 375 K and 425 K and beyond this temperature the formation of COZ could not be seen after the injection of oxygen pulses. Figure 6 shows the 11aSn Mossbauer spectra of the catalyst samples with and without Pd metal impregnation pretreated under reducing conditions by heating the samples in flowing hydrogen or CO for three hours each at 475 K. The unresolved quadrupole doublet shown in Fig. 6 (a) corresponds to Sn02 gel and is characterized by an isomeric shift 8=0.0 mm s-1 and quadrupole splitting dEq= 0.69 mm s-1. These values are in good agreement with what has been reported earlier for Sn02 catalyst samples [ 29 ] . Heating this sample in a reducing atmosphere of CO or hydrogen at 475 K for 3 h has resulted in the formation of Sn2+ species characterized by 8=1.9 mm s-1 and dEq=3.0 mm s-1 which are characteristic of Sn0 [30] present on the surface of these samples. From this figure, it is also clear that Pd incorporation has facilitated the reaction of Sn02 and the amount of Sn2+ formed is more than that observed for plain Sn02- In contrast, the Mtissbauer spectra of the sample heated in the 100 90 70 ~- W sol W a 50 z W U a 40 W a 30I 20 ~- 10- 0 275 375 475 TEMPERATURE, K 575 675 Fig. 5.

(CO+OZ) mixture, did not show the formation of Sn2+ species as can be seen from Fig. 6 (d) . It may be mentioned that the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of these reduced samples did not show any change because of their surface nature. Discussion CO oxidation over Sn02 A number of reducible oxides have been used for CO oxidation due to the presence of labile oxygen and Sn02 is one such system for which a number of experiments have already been reported. From the results presented in this study it is clear that when a pulse of ( CO + OZ) is injected over the surface of Sn02, the CO oxidation initiates at - 475 K and is almost complete by - 650 K (viz. Fig. 1(a) ). In contrast, when only CO pulse has been injected, the CO oxidation although complete, occurs at a relatively higher temperature. A preoxidized surface of Sn02 is found to facilitate CO oxidation. These results suggest that CO oxidation occurs through lattice oxygen abstraction and oxygen present in the feed mixture is used for the oxidation of the reduced catalyst surface. Thus the reaction involves two steps and oxygen withdrawal from the catalyst appears to be the rate determining step as suggested by Boreskov [ 6 ] . Mtisabauer studies carried out on Sn02 sample used for continuous flow experiments conducted with CO gas, showed the presence of Sn2+ which was absent for the sample treated with WO +Oz) gas (Fig. 6(b) and (d) ). This provides direct evidence for the mechanism suggested. Since the oxidation of M.M. Gadgil et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 307 of oxygen in the feed mixture or subsequent injection of oxygen transforms the carbon into COZ at slightly higher temperatures (Fig. 5 (b ), and 350 K < T< 450 K). The C02 formed on injection of the oxygen pulse is only due to reaction of carbon with oxygen and not due to the reaction of chemisorbed CO and oxygen. This is supported by the fact that the (CO + 02) mixture when injected over Pd/Sn02 catalyst, produces finite C02 even at room temperature, thereby suggesting that the chemisorbed CO, if any, would have produced C02 on oxygen injection at room temperature. Since we observed COz formation only above 350 K, confirms the deposition of carbon on palladium sites and the disproportionation mechanism. At higher temperatures, the direct reaction of CO with lattice oxygen of Sn02, becomes operative and is the most prominent mode of CO oxidation. As a result, the COZ yield shows a sharp increase above 450 K. This is further supported from the appearance of Sn2+ species in the Mossbauer spectra of Sn02 and Pd/Sn02 catalyst samples which were treated in CO at this temperature ( - 475 K) for 3 h. Further, the observation of enhanced Sn2+ for Pd containing catalyst as compared to Sn02, provides clear evidence for the spillover of activated CO from Pd centers to the support oxide and its subsequent reaction with lattice oxygen to produce Sn2+ species. The presence of oxygen in the reactant gas mixture rejuvenates the oxygen-depleted catalyst. The addition of oxygen to the CO pulse or the pretreatment of the catalyst with oxygen did not prevent the disproportionation of CO over the Pd surface, as can be seen from Fig. 2(a) and (c) where the decrease in COZ yield is still seen although its magnitude is less than that in Fig. 2(b). This implies that the chemisorption of CO over Pd sites is preferential compared to oxygen. The pretreatment of Pd/Sn02 catalyst in hydrogen at different temperatures did not affect the observed decrease in COZ yield at - 350 K to 375 K as can be seen from Figs. 3 and 5. The yield of C02 in the high temperature region is not significantly affected by hydrogen pretreatment of the catalyst sample at 375 K 5 T5 525 K because of the availability of lattice oxygen by partial reduction of Sn02. However, when Pd/Sn02 was pretreated in hydrogen at 625 K, there was no yield of CO, as the Sn02 is completely reduced to metallic state and forms an alloy with Pd metal. The observed reduction in the catalytic activity of Pd/Sn02, after the sequential pretreatment in oxygen and hydrogen, compared to that observed for the hydrogen and oxygen treatment alone, is an important result and can be understood in terms of blockages of Pd sites due to the formation of -OH species at the Pd sites and in its vicinity which affects the CO adsorption and its spillover. During oxygen pretreatment of the catalyst, NO., species are formed on the surface which, owing to partial reduction in subsequent hydrogen treatment, produce -OH species at Pd centers. In conclusion, we would like to mention that in the present communication, we have reported the results of CO oxidation over the surface of Pd/Sn02 which clearly establish the spillover of activated CO from Pd centers to the support and abstraction of lattice oxygen for CO oxidation. The results have 308 M.M. Gadgil et al. / J. Mot. Catal. 87 (1994) 297-310 also provided clear evidence for CO disproportionation over Pd surface to produce COZ and active carbon. A comparison of the Mossbauer spectra of Pd/ Sn02and Sn02samples treated in CO, provided direct evidence for the reduction of Sn02 support due to the reaction of the spilled over activated carbon monoxide with lattice oxygen. The reduced activity for Pd/Sn02catalyst sample when sequentially heated in oxygen and hydrogen, is understood in terms of the blockage of Pd sites by -OH species formed during partial reduction of PdOx species.

(+91-22)5560750 Oxidation of CO over the surface of SnO2 and Pd/SnO2 catalysts has been investigated with a view to understand the role of Pd metal particles which are known to improve the catalytic activity. The reaction occurs through the incorporation of lattice oxygen and an oxidized surface of the catalyst facilitates the CO oxidation. For Pd/SnO2 significant CO oxidation occurs even at room temperature as monitored by CO pulse injection technique. Disproportionation of CO into CO2 and carbon has been observed in the region 350 K ⩽T⩽ 425 K. From 119Sn Mössbauer investigations the existence of Sn2+ species in the support matrix has been observed and its extent is affected by Pd incorporation. The effect of oxygen and/or hydrogen pretreatment of Pd/SnO2 catalyst at different temperatures on its catalytic activity has been discussed.
