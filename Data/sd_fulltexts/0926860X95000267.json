As the amount of surface modifiers increased in the reactor, the rate of hydrogenation decreased over Pd/SiO2 and Rh/SiO2. The activity of Pt/SiO2 could also be lowered with quinoline; however, it remained constant for cyclohexene hydrogenation or decreased just slightly for l-hexene even when excess CC14 was supplied. The inhibition by CC14 was substantial for palladium and rhodium; nevertheless, complete deactivation did not occur. Quinoline effectively deactivated the palladium and rhodium catalysts in cyclohexene hydrogenation, but residual activity for 1-hexene hydrogenation was above 50% for each of the catalysts used.

Introduction Studying the reactivity- and selectivity-influencing properties of surface modi- fiers is crucial as far as industrial catalysis is concerned. Sulfur-, nitrogen- and/or halogen-containing compounds are generally constituents of the, mostly petroleum- based, industrial feedstocks and it is often impossible or too expensive to get rid of them. They may have beneficial as well as detrimental effects on the performance of the catalysts. Knowledge of the underlying principles of the rate- and selectivity- E-mail palinko@chem.u-szeged.hu, tel.

In this work we report on the effects of co- or preadsorbed quinoline or CCIa in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of 1-hexene or cyclohexene over silica-supported Pt, Pd and Rh catalysts. In the following two paragraphs, the presently available information on the interactions of these modifiers with metallic surfaces is summarized briefly. 1.1. Carbon tetrachloride on metal surfaces The interactions of halogens and halocarbons with metals attract considerable interest (for a review, see [ 1 ] ). In catalysis halogens are considered as inhibitors (see, e.g. [2] ). Although there are numerous papers concerning the behavior of chlorine over metal surfaces, CC14 is rarely considered as surface modifier. Mostly, the CC14-Fe(110) system of tribological importance was studied [3-5]. Here, irreversible dissociative adsorption was found at 300 K in an UHV system and dissociation was increased by defect sites [4,5]. Ni(110) also dissociated CCl4 at 300 K and chlorine atoms adsorbed in five-coordinated sites, in the channels of the (110) surface [ 6 ]. Adsorbed and presumably dissociated CCl4 decreased the activ- ity of Cu/AleO3 in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. However, it exerted a beneficial effect on the selectivity towards crotylalcohol formation (hydrogenation of the carbonyl group) [ 7 ]. Dissociation occurred over platinum surfaces as well and adsorbed CCl4 poisoned the Pt-catalyzed high-temperature oxidation and hydrogenation of graphite [8]. It also suppressed hydrogenolysis activity of a Pt/AI203 reforming catalyst, due to carbon lay-down which decreased hydrogen chemisorption [ 9]. It is important to note that chlorine atoms remained on the surface even in the presence of hydrogen and at elevated (673 K) temper- ature. Weiss et al. [ 10] found, however, that hydrodechlorination proceeded even at ambient temperature (with a very low rate, though) when a CC14-H2 mixture was adsorbed over Pt/A1203 catalyst. They concluded that the adsorption of CCl4 was dissociative and assumed a mechanism in which adsorbed chlorine combined with adsorbed hydrogen. They supposed that HC1, thus formed, desorbed easily. Adsorbed CC13 reacted with adsorbed hydrogen and desorbed as chloroform. A similar mechanism was assumed for the CC14-H2-Pd/pumice system between 353- 383 K and 10-50 atm hydrogen pressure range [ 11,12]. 1.2. Quinoline over metal surfaces Hydrodenitrogenation of quinoline is thoroughly studied (for a recent review, see [ 13 ] ) and it is known that it requires a relatively high temperature and pressures above atmospheric. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure the compound is stable; none of the tings are hydrogenated over transition metal surfaces. The lowest temperature presently known for C-N bond cleavage in quinoline is 473 K I. P~link6 /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 39~t9 41 at atmospheric pressure over 40% Pt/SiO2 [ 14]. Here, the N-containing ring was hydrogenated first, then C-N hydrogenolysis occurred. As an additive, it is known to improve the selectivity in certain reactions, e.g., in semihydrogenation of triple bond [ 15], or in the Rosenmund reaction [ 16,17]. In the Pd-catalyzed semihydro- genation of acetylenes, it is believed [18] that the high selectivity is due to a reduced rate of alkene hydrogenation, while semihydrogenation of the triple bond is largely unaffected. On the other hand, quinoline may rearrange the surface of the palladium catalyst, creating new sites, appropriate for semihydrogenation of either acetylenes [ 19 ] or acid chlorides. In the Rosenmund reaction, the poison molecule may act through breaking up large ensembles necessary for alcohol formation and, of course, it is also an HC1 binding agent. The remaining (unpoisoned) ensembles, however, may be adequate for semi-hydrogenation leading to aldehyde [20]. It is clear, that N-containing compounds in general, and quinoline in particular, have a detrimental effect on metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. Unfortunately, how- ever, almost nothing is known about the mode (s) of adsorption of quinoline. Only a single paper [21] presents an experimental result concerning quinoline adsorp- tion: in Ag sol it was adsorbed 'stand up' on the surface of the metal as determined by SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy). Even speculations are rare [22]. Three different adsorption modes were assumed over a 50% Ni-NiO/SiO2- A1203 catalyst (i) bonding through the lone-pair of nitrogen, (ii) bonding through the ~--sextet of the other ring and (iii) bonding through the lone-pair of nitrogen and at the adjacent carbon, after dissociation of the hydrogen atom. In spite of occasionally conflicting reports (for a review, see [ 23 ] ), this latter model, a tilted ~-pyridil-like adsorption seems to be the most probable, considering the majority of experimental results concerning the adsorption of pyridine, an analogous mole- cule, over a variety of transition metal surfaces around 300 K [24-28]. 2. Experimental Cyclohexene and 1 -hexene were purchased from Aldrich and were of Gold Label quality. The alkenes were gas chromatographically pure and were passed through a column filled with freshly activated basic alumina (Camag) under inert (Ar) atmosphere before the reactions. CC14 was an Aldrich product as well and was used without further purification. The catalysts were made with impregnation or ion-exchange methods. Charac- teristic data are to be found in Table 1. Hydrogenation reactions (actually D2 was used) were carried out in the liquid phase at 298 K. 500/~1 of the alkene was used without solvent. The D2 pressure was kept 101.3 kPa throughout the reaction. Diffusion limitations were avoided by using small amounts of catalysts (5 or 10 mg) and a high stirring rate (2000 rpm). For poisoning, we used 0.1% and 0.01% solutions of CC14 or quinoline in n- heptane. (Occasionally, pure CC14 was used.) The solutions were kept under inert 42 L Pcilink6 /Applied (k~ml~sis A: General 126 (1995) 39-49 Table 1 Characterization data on the catalysts Catalyst Loading/% % exp. atoms Pt/SiO~ 3.0 9d Rh/SiO~ 3.0 13d Pd/SiO2 3.0\" 5c 0.46 65c 0.083b 81~ 0.65b 94~ a Cab-O-Sil support (BDH product), impregnation. b Davison silica, ion-exchange. \" CO chemisorption ( 1:l stoichiometry was assumed), flow system, room temperature. a H2 chemisorption ( l:l adsorption stoichiometry was assumed), static system, room temperature. atmosphere (Ar). Poisoning experiments were done essentially in two ways: (i) injecting a certain amount of modifier dissolved in n-heptane onto the catalyst before hydrogenation (preadsorption), (ii) quenching the hydrogenation at first and then injecting the poison into the reactor (sequential adsorption). The two methods gave identical results for cyclohexene. Only the preadsorption method was used for 1-hexene. To probe the strength of the adsorption of the poison, experiments were per- formed with both modifiers in cyclohexene hydrogenation using the 0.65% Pd/ SiO2 catalyst. The experiments were performed with the sequential adsorption method. The only difference was that the catalyst was diluted with 10 mg of the support. The hydrogenation reactions were followed by deuterium uptake, initial rates were determined and turnover frequency data (TOF) were calculated. For more details concerning the apparatus and procedure, see [ 29,30]. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristic features in the hydrogenation reactions of l-hexene and cyclohexene The first step of our experimental work was the determination of the turnover rate in the alkene hydrogenation reactions (Table 2). A very close agreement was found with Boudart's data concerning cyclohexene hydrogenation over platinum [ 31 ] and palladium [ 32] catalysts in the liquid phase. The turnover rate over our low-dispersion Rh/SiO2 was lower than those over their high-dispersion Rh/AI203 catalysts [33]. The hydrogenation was a zero-order reaction in the alkene over each catalyst up to more than 60% conversion, in complete accordance with the observation of Boudart and co-workers [31-33]. The hydrogen pressure was kept constant throughout the experiments.

For 1-hexene, initial rates were determined, because isomeri- zation occurs over palladium [34] and the non-terminal alkenes hydrogenate slower. Indeed, deuterium uptake decreased appreciably after a short initial period. A similar effect was found for rhodium, but over platinum no decrease in rate was observed in complete accordance what was expected. It is to be remarked that the hydrogenation of both alkenes showed mild structure sensitivity over palladium catalysts, with an apparent maximum in hydrogenation rate near 60% dispersion. 3.2. Effects of carbon tetrachloride on the hydrogenation reactions of the alkenes The effect of Gel4 on the hydrogenation reactions of the alkenes over Pt, Pd and Rh catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. Over palladium and rhodium catalysts, a fast almost linear decrease was observed first, then the poisoning plot curved and a residual hydrogenation activity remained even in the presence of excess CC14. Over Rh/SiO2, however, the residual activity in 1-hexene hydrogenation was appreciable just as over the low-dispersion 3.0% Pd/SiO2. This means that the chlorine tolerance of rhodium seems to be higher than that of the high-dispersion palladium catalysts. It is striking, however, that CC14 did not influence the hydrogenation activity of Pt/SiO2 for cyclohexene at all and just slightly for 1-hexene (overall rate decrease in this case was less than 10%). For cyclohexene there was no rate decrease even in huge excess of CC14, when the apparent CC14 coverage (no. of CC14 molecules/ no. of exposed platinum atoms) was above 40. 3.3. Effects of quinoline on the hydrogenation reactions of the alkenes The effects of quinoline on the hydrogenation reactions are displayed in Fig. 2. Some general trends could be observed, but interestingly, sometimes substantial differences were also found. 44 1. P6link6 / Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 39~49 1 a | I .

Pdlmk6 /Applied Camh'sis A: General 126 (1995) 39~49 In general, quinoline addition decreased the hydrogenation rate of both alkenes over each catalyst. Hydrogenation activity was not eliminated even in the presence of excess quinoline. Except one case (cyclohexene over Rh/SiO2), initially, the rate decreased rapidly as the apparent coverage grew; later on, this decrease slowed down considerably. As an important difference, the residual activity of the catalysts for l-hexene hydrogenation was above 50% over each catalyst, even in excess quinoline. For cyclohexene, although the initial deactivation rate was slower, the residual activity was about 10% of the original over the platinum and the palladium catalysts. The behavior of Rh/SiO2 in cyclohexene hydrogenation was very different, since a slight rate increase preceded a very slow deactivation with rising quinoline cover- age. 4. Discussion 4.1. Carbon tetrachloride and quinoline as deactivators Carbon tetrachloride Literature results suggest that CC14 decomposes upon adsorption and actually CC13 and C1 remain chemisorbed on the surface [ 3 ]. The initial decrease is possibly due to the adsorption over highly active sites, i.e. strong chemisorption occurs. The strength of the attachment is indicated by the observation that dilution of catalysts with pure support does not influence the first, steeply decreasing part of the poi- soning curve. Later on, adsorption may become reversible over the less active sites and there are still uncovered surface atoms where hydrogenation proceeds even in excess CCl4. It is important to note that hydrogen does not remove the rate-decreas- ing adsorbed species (probably chlorine or CC13) from the surface of the palladium or rhodium catalysts. Quinoline As concerns the surface modifying effects of quinoline, received wisdom, sum- marized in the first section of the paper, and experimental results obtained show that quinoline adsorbs on the metals and does not react itself (neither C-N hydro- genolysis nor ring hydrogenation occur). Quinoline, even in excess, does not cover the metal surface with equally strongly chemisorbed moieties. At the steeply decreasing part of the poisoning curve, the most active sites are covered, strong adsorption occurs, since dilution with the support does not alter this part of the curve. However, adsorption over the weaker sites is influenced in that a larger amount of modifier is necessary to reach the same deactivation level. All these mean that after the initial deactivation quinoline adsorbs on the support too. The weakly held quinoline is displaced by the alkenes and hydrogenation proceeds over this part of the surface. The higher residual activity in the hydrogenation of 1- L Pdlink6/Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) 39~19 47 hexene suggests that 1-hexene adsorbs more strongly than cyclohexene and thus, displacement occurs at lower quinoline coverage. As concerns the adsorption of quinoline, based on analogies [22-28], it is suggested that the lone pair of the N atom is involved in the adsorption and perhaps a-carbon of the N-containing ring is also adsorbed (a sort of dissociative adsorp- tion), which would make a chemisorbed quinoline tilted to the surface with some angle, i.e., quinoline stands up over the surface. It is important to note that the activity of Rh/SiO2 catalyst in cyclohexene hydrogenation is not seriously affected. The special N-tolerance of rhodium might be a reasonable explanation; nevertheless, it must be discarded, as 1-hexene hydro- genation is slowed down by quinoline in much the same way as over palladium and platinum catalysts. 4.2. Carbon tetrachloride over Pt/Si02 The reason why CC14 does not influence the hydrogenation activity of Pt/SiO2 is not clear yet. It is known that platinum dissociates and chemisorbs C12 [35] as well as CC14 [ 10] at room temperature. On one hand, it is possible that adsorbed hydrogen removes adsorbed chlorine or CC13. On the other hand, however, the adsorbed species from CC14 are not removed even by a high-temperature ( 1107 K) hydrogen treatment over Pt/graphite [8]. We found that adsorbed moieties from CCl4 are not or just partially removed by hydrogen over palladium and rhodium catalysts as well. Our experimental findings favor an explanation which assumes the desorption of adsorbed species by hydrogen. Since adsorbed chlorine resulting from high-temperature CC14 cleavage is not desorbed by hydrogen, in spite of contradicting results from Weiss et al. [ 10], we must assume that CC14 does not dissociate over Pt/SiO2 and its adsorption is weaker than that of hydrogen. This dramatic difference between platinum and the other metals deserves atten- tion. 4.3. A comparison of the poisoning efficiency of CCI4 and quinoline Based on the early works of Maxted and his co-workers (for a review, see [36] ), the effectiveness of poisoning (toxicity) can be evaluated using the following (a slightly modified) equation: TOF/TOFo = 1 - c~0 where TOF is the actual turnover frequency, TOFo is the turnover frequency in the unpoisoned state, a is the slope of the upper straight line (the steeply decreasing part of the poisoning curve), 0 is the apparent coverage by the poison molecules. The unit of a is no. of surface atoms/no, of poison molecules, which means the number of surface atoms deactivated by one poison molecule (Table 3). 48 l.

I 0.65 0.56 0.79 0.46 2.4 Data in the table reveal that both additives are relatively weak deactivators in cyclohexene hydrogenation. Carbon tetrachloride strongly influences the hydro- genation of 1-hexene over Rh/SiO2 and the highly dispersed Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Carbon tetrachloride deactivates about one surface atom in cyclohexene hydrogen- ation, but more than one in the similar reaction of 1-hexene. Deactivation of 1- hexene hydrogenation upon the adsorption of either additive seems to be structure sensitive over Pd/SiO2 catalysts, but not when cyclohexene is hydrogenated.

Quinoline and carbon tetrachloride István Pálinkó 1 Department of Organic Chemistry, József Attila University, Dóm tér 8, Szeged, H-6720, Hungary 1 tel. (+36-62) 311622X3595, fax. (+36-62) 321523. Hydrogenation of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was studied over silica-supported Pt, Pd and Rh catalysts in the liquid phase, in the presence of quinoline or carbon tetrachloride at room temperature. As the amount of surface modifiers increased in the reactor, the rate of hydrogenation decreased over Pd SiO 2 and Rh SiO 2 . The activity of Pt SiO 2 could also be lowered with quinoline; however, it remained constant for cyclohexene hydrogenation or decreased just slightly for 1-hexene even when excess CCl4 was supplied. The inhibition by CCl4 was substantial for palladium and rhodium; nevertheless, complete deactivation did not occur. Quinoline effectively deactivated the palladium and rhodium catalysts in cyclohexene hydrogenation, but residual activity for 1-hexene hydrogenation was above 50% for each of the catalysts used.
