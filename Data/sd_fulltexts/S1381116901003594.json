Tel.: +91-20-589-3300x2163; fax: +91-20-589-3041/3355 Direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2 over powdered PdO-containing fluorinated or sulfated Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, ThO2, Y2O3, Ga2O3 catalysts with or without pre-reduction by hydrazine, using a pure water or 0.02M H2SO4 as reaction medium and a gaseous feed consisting of 1.7vol.% H2 in O2, in a magnetically stirred glass reactor at 22°C and atmospheric pressure has been investigated. The catalysts have been characterized for their surface area and also by CO chemisorption. The performance of the catalysts in the decomposition of H2O2 at 22°C has also been studied. The results showed a strong influence of catalyst reduction, fluorination (or chlorination) or sulfatation of the catalyst support and the acidity of reaction medium on both the conversion and H2O2 selectivity in the direct oxidation of H2. An acidic medium is essential for achieving both the high conversion and high selectivity in the H2 oxidation. The reduced catalysts showed much lower H2O2 selectivity in the H2 oxidation process and much higher H2O2 decomposition activity. The water in the H2 to H2O2 oxidation over the above catalysts is formed in parallel and/or consecutive reactions, depending upon the catalyst used. Keywords Oxidation of H2 to H2O2 Supported palladium catalysts Fluorinated palladium catalyst Sulfated palladium catalyst Decomposition of H2O2 1 Introduction Hydrogen peroxide is an environ-friendly strong oxidizing agent. Hence, its demand for domestic/industrial wastewater treatment, water disinfection, catalytic oxidation processes and other industrial applications has been increasing day-by-day. The presently practiced anthraquinone process [1] for the production of H2O2 has several other limitations; the cost of H2O2 produced by this process is not low enough to use it for producing bulk chemicals and/or for wastewater treatment. It is, therefore, of great practical interest to produce H2O2 more economically by a novel process, which is also environmentally clean, such as that based on the direct oxidation of H2. Direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2 over different Pd-containing catalysts has been disclosed in several patents [2,3]. But the information on this process in the published papers is scarce [2–4]. Very recently, we have suggested the use of a novel composite Pd-membrane catalyst for the non-hazardous direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2 [2]. Earlier, Fu et al. [4] have carried out liquid-phase oxidation of H2 to H2O2 in an acidic medium over Pd/fluorinated carbon catalyst at high pressures (0.5–2.3MPa) at −10 to 25°C; the maximum H2O2 selectivity reported was 8.7% (at 41% H2 conversion) even in the presence of a H2O2 stabilizer. They have observed that the H2O2 decomposition to water and oxygen occurs in a consecutive reaction on the same catalyst; the higher the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst, the lower is the H2O2 selectivity in the H2 oxidation process. The flammability or explosive range for the concentration of H2 in O2 is very wide (4–94% H2 in O2). Hence, the direct H2 oxidation process is highly hazardous one. However, it can be made non-hazardous by operating it with the H2 concentrations (in O2) far away from the explosion range. This work was undertaken with the objective of studying the performance of different supported Pd or PdO catalysts (such as Pd or PdO supported on alumina, zirconia, ceria, thoria, yttria and gallia, with or without their modification by fluorination, chlorination or sulfatation) in the direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2 using a mixed H2/O2 feed (1.7vol.% H2 in O2, which is far away from the explosion range) and also in the decomposition of H2O2, in a stirred slurry reactor. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The PdO-containing catalysts (Table 1 ) were prepared by impregnating PdCl2 from its HCl solution on γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, Y2O3 or ThO2, fluorinated γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, Ga2O3, Y2O3, ThO2 or CeO2, and sulfated ZrO2 or Ga2O3 by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. After impregnation, the wet catalyst mass was dried at 100°C for 4h and then calcined under static air in muffle furnace at 500°C for 3h. The presence of PdO phase in the catalyst was confirmed by XRD. Fluorination (or chlorination) or sulfatation was carried out by impregnating the respective support with ammonium fluoride (or chloride) or H2SO4 (equivalent to 5wt.% F, Cl or S on the support) from its aqueous solution followed by drying on hot water bath and calcining in muffle furnace at 500°C for 3h. The PdO-containing catalysts were reduced by treating them with an ammonical hydrazine solution on hot water bath for 2h followed by washing, filtration and drying at 100°C in an air oven. The presence of metallic Pd phase in the reduced catalysts was confirmed by XRD. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The surface area of the catalysts was measured by the single-point BET method, using a Monosorb Surface Area Analyser (Quantachrome, USA). Chemisorption of CO on the catalyst, after its reduction by H2 at 500°C, was measured at 40°C using a GC pulse technique [5]. 2.3 Catalytic reactions The direct oxidation of hydrogen to hydrogen peroxide reaction over the catalysts was carried out in a magnetically stirred glass reactor (capacity=250 cm 3) containing 0.5g catalyst and 150cm3 aqueous 0.02M sulfuric acid solution as a reaction medium by bubbling continuously a hydrogen and oxygen mixture (1.7vol.% H2) at a flow rate of 11.5cm−3 min−1 through the liquid reaction medium under vigorous stirring at 22°C and atmospheric pressure (0.95atm) for a period of 3h. The concentration of hydrogen in the effluent gases, after removing water vapors from them by condensation at 0°C, was measured by an online hydrogen analyzer. After the reaction, the catalyst from the reaction mixture was removed by filtration and the filtered reaction mixture was analyzed for the hydrogen peroxide formed in the reaction by iodometric titration method. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide over the catalysts was carried out in the magnetically stirred reactor containing 0.2g catalyst and 150cm3 acidic (0.02M sulfuric acid) solution containing 0.2% (w/v) H2O2. The amount of O2 liberated in the decomposition was measured as a function of time using a constant pressure gas collector [6]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalysts characterization The catalysts have been characterized for their surface area, CO chemisorption (at 40°C) on reduced catalyst, and relative acidity (measured in terms of the amount of NaOH required to neutralize the acid sites on the catalyst). The surface properties of the catalysts are given in Table 1. The results show that the surface area, CO chemisorption and the relative acidity are strongly influenced by the fluorination, chlorination or sulfatation of the supports (except ThO2) used in the catalyst. In general, the acidity is increased markedly due to the halogenation or the sulfatation of the support. 3.2 Effect of reaction medium Results showing the effect of acidity of the aqueous reaction medium on the performance of the different supported PdO catalysts in the H2 to H2O2 oxidation process are presented in Table 2 . The results show strong influence of the acidity of the aqueous reaction medium on both the conversion and selectivity in the process. All the catalysts show much higher activity (H2 conversion) and H2O2 selectivity when acidic medium (0.02M H2SO4) used in the process as compared to the pure water as the reaction medium. This is consistent with our earlier observation that the H2O2 decomposition activity of Pd/carbon catalyst decreases markedly with increasing the concentration of H2SO4 in the aqueous reaction medium [7]. In the earlier studies using Pd supported on phosphate viologen phosphonate catalyst using aqueous H2SO4 as the reaction medium, there was no significant production of H2O2 in the H2 oxidation, even at much higher pressure [3]. The H2O2 selectivity observed for the present catalysts using 0.02M H2SO4 or even water as the reaction medium is much higher than that observed earlier for Pd/fluorinated carbon catalyst using an acidic medium [4]. 3.3 Effect of catalyst reduction Results in Table 3 show the effect of reduction of the supported PdO catalysts (by hydrazine) on their performance in both the H2 to H2O2 oxidation and H2O2 decomposition reactions at 22°C. The kinetic data for the H2O2 decomposition (at 22°C) over the catalysts, with or without pre-reduction (by hydrazine) are presented in Fig. 1 . The H2O2 decomposition data could be fitted well to first-order rate law: ln[1/(1−x)]=k a t, where x is the fractional decomposition of H2O2, k a the first-order rate constant and t the time. The pre-reduced catalysts (Pd0-containing catalysts) showed much lower H2O2 selectivity and also lower activity (except for Pd/CeO2) in the H2 oxidation but much higher H2O2 decomposition activity. The decrease in the H2O2 selectivity is because of the increased H2O2 decomposition activity of the corresponding catalyst after its reduction. These comparative results clearly show that the catalysts in their oxidized form are more selective and even more active in the oxidation of H2 to H2O2 but less active in the H2O2 decomposition. 3.4 Comparison of supported PdO catalysts The PdO-containing catalysts are compared in Figs. 2 and 3 for their performance both in the H2 oxidation and H2O2 decomposition reactions (at 22°C), using 0.02M H2SO4 as the reaction medium. From the comparison, following important observations for the catalyst with different supports can be made. Al2O3-supported PdO catalysts. Fluorination (or chlorination) has a small effect on the H2 conversion activity but a very large effect on the H2O2 selectivity; the later is increased drastically by the fluorination or chlorination of the γ-alumina. However, the H2O2 decomposition (in 3h) over these catalysts is very small when compared to the H2 conversion. This shows that the formation of H2O2 and water in the H2 oxidation over these catalysts occurs essentially in the parallel reactions: (1) Because of the very poor activity of the catalysts for H2O2 decomposition, the possibility of water formation in the H2 oxidation in the consecutive reaction (2) H 2 → O 2 H 2 O 2 → −0.5O 2 H 2 O is small. The higher H2O2 selectivity and the lower H2O2 decomposition activity of the fluorinated or chlorinated Al2O3-containing catalyst may be due to its increased acidity (protonic acidity) resulting from the halogenation of Al2O3 [8]. ZrO2-supported PdO catalysts. In this case also, the H2O2 selectivity is increased drastically after the fluorination or sulfatation of the support. However, unlike the alumina-supported PdO catalysts, the ZrO2-supported PdO catalysts also have high H2O2 decomposition activity, which is decreased after fluorination or sulfatation due to the increased acidity. Hence, the formation of H2O2 and water in the H2 oxidation over these catalysts is expected also by the consecutive reaction (reaction 2). CeO2-, Y2O3- and ThO2-supported PdO catalysts. In these cases, the fluorination of support results in an increase in the H2 conversion but a decrease in both the H2O2 selectivity and the H2O2 decomposition activity of the catalyst (Fig. 3). The H2O2 decomposition activity of PdO/fluorinated CeO2 (or ThO2) catalyst is very low and hence the formation of H2O2 and H2O over the catalyst is expected mainly by the parallel reactions (reaction 1). However, the H2O2 decomposition activity of the PdO/ThO2, PdO/CeO2 and PdO/Y2O3 is quite high. Hence, over these catalysts, the formation of water in the H2 oxidation is expected mainly by the consecutive reaction (reaction 2). PdO/fluorinated (or sulfated) Ga2O3 catalysts. These catalysts showed high H2 conversion activity but very poor selectivity for H2O2 and also poor H2O2 decomposition activity, indicating formation of H2O2 and H2O in the H2 oxidation mainly by the parallel reactions (reaction 1). When compared for the H2O2 yield [conversion (%)×selectivity (%)/100] obtained in the H2 oxidation process, the catalysts showed the following order (Figs. 2 and 3): PdO/ThO 2>PdO/fluorinatedγ-Al 2 O 3>PdO/fluorinatedCeO 2>PdO/chlorinatedγ-Al 2 O 3>PdO/CeO 2 >PdO/fluorinatedZrO 2≥PdO/sulfatedZrO 2>PdO/fluorinatedY 2 O 3>PdO/fluorinatedThO 2 >PdO/fluorinatedGa 2 O 3≥PdO/sulfatedGa 2 O 3>PdO/Y 2 O 3>PdO/γ-Al 2 O 3≥PdO/ZrO 2 . The H2O2 yields obtained over the PdO supported on ThO2 (13.3%), fluorinated γ-Al2O3 (12.7%) or CeO2 (12.5%), chlorinated γ-Al2O3 (12.3%), CeO2 (11.8%), fluorinated or sulfated ZrO2 (11.4%), and fluorinated Y2O3 (7.4%) catalysts are much higher than that (3.6%) reported earlier over the Pd/fluorinated carbon catalyst. 4 Conclusions From the above studies on the direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2 and H2O2 decomposition reactions over the different fluorinated or sulfated Al2O3-, ZrO2-, CeO2-, Y2O3-, ThO2- and Ga2O3-supported PdO or Pd catalysts, the following important conclusions have been drawn. 1. The modification by fluorination or sulfatation of Al2O3 or ZrO2 support causes a drastic increase in the H2O2 selectivity of the catalyst but that of CeO2, Y2O3 and ThO2 results in a decrease in the selectivity and an increase in the H2 conversion activity of the catalyst in the H2 oxidation. The PdO/ThO2, PdO/fluorinated/chlorinated or sulfated Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, and PdO/CeO2 are promising catalysts for the direct oxidation of H2 to H2O2. 2. The water in the H2 oxidation over the supported PdO catalysts is formed in the parallel and/or consecutive reaction, depending upon the support used in the catalyst. It is formed mostly by the parallel reaction over the fluorinated (or chlorinated) Al2O3, CeO2 and Ga2O3 and sulfated Ga2O3-supported PdO catalysts but by the consecutive reaction over the ZrO2-, CeO2-, Y2O3- and ThO2-supported PdO catalysts. 3. The catalysts after the reduction of their PdO to Pd0 (by hydrazine) showed much lower selectivity in the oxidation of H2 to H2O2 and much higher H2O2 decomposition activity. 4. Both the activity and H2O2 selectivity (in the H2 oxidation) of the catalysts depend strongly on the acidity of the aqueous reaction medium; the selectivity is much higher when the reaction medium is acidic.
