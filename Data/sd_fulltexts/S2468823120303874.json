Graphical abstract Palladium catalysts immobilized on DNA (Pd/DNA) were applied for the first time in the carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, at 1 atm of CO. Different alkynones were obtained with a high yield in DMF. In the presence of water, the selectivity completely changed and diaryl alkynes, typical Sonogashira products, were selectively formed. In addition to Pd/DNA, soluble palladium species also participated in the catalytic process. The stability of the catalytic system increased after the addition of DNA excess. Keywords Palladium Nanoparticles DNA Carbonylative Sonogashira coupling Introduction Carbonylative Sonogashira reaction presents the most straightforward synthetic procedure leading to alkynones, via coupling of terminal alkynes with aryl or vinyl halides and CO [1–3]. The reaction has a high potential in organic synthesis, enabling preparation of biologically active molecules. Alkynones can be used in the synthesis of furanones, pyrroles or pyrazoles [4]. The first example of carbonylative Sonogashira coupling with Pd catalyst was reported in 1981 [5]. Similarly as in Sonogashira coupling, in this reaction palladium catalyst can be used in the presence of Cu co-catalyst [1–3]. However, Cu-free systems have been also reported [1–3]. Alkynones can be obtained using CO gas, or, alternatively, with other CO donors, such as Mo(CO)6 or formic acid [6–8]. These modified procedures enabled avoid toxic CO and simplified experimental methodology. Different soluble palladium compounds have been tested in carbonylative Sonogashira reaction with good or excellent results [9–15]. However immobilization of the catalyst on the solid support made it possible its reuse in subsequent catalytic runs. Moreover, efficient separation of the catalyst resulted in preparation of palladium – free product suitable for further applications, for example in pharmaceuticals production [16,17]. Only a few heterogenized catalysts for carbonylative Sonogashira coupling have been presented [18–27]. In these systems ZrMOF-BIPY [23], K10 clay [27], MCM-41 [20], Fe3O4 [19,24] or Sihopex® [26] metal scavengers have been used as supports. However DNA biopolymer was not used for this purpose yet. Due to its functionalization with different functional groups, DNA can coordinate to metal ions and metal nanoparticles [28–30]. The special structure and non-toxicity of DNA have encouraged researchers to test it as a support for palladium immobilization. Thus, Pd/DNA has been tested as a catalyst in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling [31–34], hydrogenation [35], imination [36] and Sonogashira reactions [37]. Recently, for the first time, we applied Pd/DNA in the aminocarbonylation and hydroxycarbonylation, using CO gas or Mo(CO)6 and high yield of products was obtained [38]. These results evidenced the ability of Pd/DNA to activate CO under mild conditions. In this paper, we would like to report the first example of the application of Pd/DNA catalyst in the carbonylative Sonogashira reaction. In the absence of CO, the same system was also employed for Sonogashira coupling to produce diphenylacetylenes. Experimental All the chemicals and solvents were used as received, without purification. Preparation of Pd/DNA K1: Catalyst K1 was prepared according to the method we described in our previous works [33,38], using fish sperm DNA (CAS:438545-06-3). K2: Catalyst K2 was prepared according to the method we described in our previous works [33,38], using low molecular weight fish sperm DNA (CAS:100403-24-5). K3: 50 mg of DNA (CAS:100403-24-5) was dissolved in 5 mL of water. To this solution 32 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 5 mL of water were added. The resulted mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 21 h. Then, 28.5 u L of hydrazine hydrate, NH2NH2.H2O, (50–60 %) was added and stirring was continued for 3 h. The mixture changed in color from brown to black. The catalyst K3 was separated by centrifugation, washed with acetone and air dried. (Pd content determined by ICP: 3.57 mmol/g) Carbonylative Sonogashira coupling To a 50 mL Schlenk flask were added aryl iodide (1 mmol), alkyne (1.2 mmol), Et3N (3 mmol), Pd/DNA (containing 0.01 mmol of Pd) and 3 mL of DMF. The flask was cooled in liquid nitrogen, evacuated and connected with CO balloon. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h at 80 °C. After that time, the flask was cooled down to ambient temperature and 5 mL of H2O was added. The products were separated by extraction, using 3 × 7 mL of Et2O, and analyzed by GC-FID with an internal standard (mesitylene, 0.076 mL). The crude product, obtained after evaporation of solvent, was purified by column chromatography on silica gel and characterized by GC–MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Procedures for Pd/DNA recycling Method 1. After the first run, the flask was cooled down and 5 mL of H2O was added. Organic products were separated by extraction with 3 × 7 mL of Et2O. The remaining phase, containing the catalyst, was evaporated using a rotary vacuum evaporator. To the as obtained reused catalyst, iodobenzene (1 mmol), phenylacetylene (1.2 mmol), Et3N (3 mmol), and 3 mL of DMF were added. Then, the flask was cooled in liquid nitrogen, evacuated and connected with CO balloon. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h at 80 °C and the products were analyzed by GC-FID. Method 2. After the first run, the flask was cooled down to ambient temperature, and 200 μL sample was taken for GC-FID analysis. Afterward, the next portion of substrates was added to the flask (iodobenzene, 1 mmol; phenylacetylene, 1.2 mmol; Et3N, 3 mmol) and the heating was continued for 6 h at 80 °C. Method 3. The reaction was performed according to the general procedure with addition of 10 mg of low molecular weight DNA (CAS:100403-24-5). Results and discussion Catalyst characterization The catalyst K1, obtained at room temperature, was characterized in the previous studies [33,38]. It contained a mixture of Pd(II) and Pd(0) in the ratio ca. 4:1 according to XPS. The Pd(0) nanoparticles size distribution was relatively wide, from 3 to 25 nm, with a maximum ca. 13−15 nm. The similar results were obtained for K2 catalyst, immobilized on the DNA polymer of low molecular weight. The relatively broad size distribution of nanoparticles was observed with the diameter 10–21 nm and maximum at ca. 13–15 nm and (Fig. 1 ). The XRD patterns, presented in Fig. 2 , shown well-defined peaks assigned to crystallized Pd(0). The average diameter of Pd(0) nanoparticles calculated from the Debye-Scherrer equation was 11 and 9 nm for catalysts K1 and K2 respectively. Smaller nanoparticles, ca. 4 nm in diameter, have been found in the K3 catalyst, obtained by reduction with hydrazine hydrate hydroxide (Fig. 2). Analysis of the FT-IR spectra of DNA and K2 indicated shifts of some peaks. The mode associated with the nucleobases at 1694 cm−1 in DNA (ν(CC), ν(CO), and ν(CN)) shifted to 1637 cm−1 after coordination of Pd. In contrast, symmetric stretching peak of PO2 − at 1062 cm−1 did not obviously change. Small shift of asymmetric PO2- stretch from 1227 to 1232 cm-1 was noted. The NH deformation shifted from 1420 to 1410 cm−1 These FT-IR data indicated that Pd coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of nucleobases, rather than to phosphate (Fig. 3 ). In agreement with this assumption the chemical shifts of 31P signal in 31P CP/MAS NMR for K2 and for DNA were almost the same, indicating that Pd did not bind to the P atoms (Fig. 1 ESI). Pd/DNA catalyzed carbonylative Sonogashira coupling The coupling of iodobenzene with phenylacetylene was studied under CO (balloon pressure) with catalyst K1 (Scheme 1 ). Different solvents and bases were tested in order to find the best conditions for high yield of alkynone 1a (Table 1 ). In reactions carried out with inorganic bases, the desired product (1a) was obtained with lower yield than with Et3N base (Table 1). When reactions conducted with Et3N in toluene or dioxane the selectivity was very good, but the highest yield of 1a was 59 % and 64 % after 15 h or 24 h respectively (Table 1). The reaction was faster in DMF and produced 67 % of 1a in 6 h. Further increase in the yield of 1a to 83 % was achieved after increase of the catalyst amount to 2 mol%. The use of a mixed solvent systems with water as the second solvent, resulted in a decrease of reaction selectivity for 1a (Table 1, entries 15–20). However, the addition of water increased the yield of diphenylacetylene, 2a. In fact, it became the only product in the dioxane/H2O mixture in the presence of KOH base (Table 1, entry 20). Similarly, 2a was obtained with high yield, 73 %, in water with Et3N base. The change of the reaction selectivity in the presence of water, from 1a to 2a, can be explained by competition of water with CO for the place in the palladium environment. The high affinity of DNA to water can play an important role in this case. As a result carbonylative coupling switched to the Sonogashira coupling. Reactions of iodobenzene with phenylacetylene in CO atmosphere were conducted next with various Pd catalysts for comparison (Table 2 ). The results obtained for K1 and K2 catalysts were similar, however they were achieved with different amount of Pd. In the case of K2 1 mol% of catalyst produced 87 % of 1a, while 83 % were formed with 2 mol% of K1 under the same conditions. The morphology of Pd(0) nanoparticles was similar in both catalysts, in particular in both cases relatively big nanoparticles were identified by TEM. It can be therefore assumed that the difference in a DNA molecular structure played an important role. Thus, a DNA support influence on the access and activation of substrates on the active Pd centers. A positive effect of DNA was also noted in a reaction catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 (Table 2, entry 6). In this reaction the yield of 1a increased from 56 % to 63 % after addition of DNA. It can be assumed that DNA stabilized the in situ formed Pd nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation and deactivation. Unfortunately, the pre-reduced K3 catalyst was even less active than Pd(OAc)2, despite of the presence of Pd nanoparticles smaller than in K1 and K2 (Table 2). Moderate results were also noted for commercial catalyst, Pd/C, containing mostly Pd(0). These results showed that pre-reduction of palladium did not increase the yield of alkynone and better results were obtained using Pd(0)/Pd(II) composite immobilized on DNA. The substrate scope was next studied with catalyst K2 using substituted phenylacetylenes and aryl iodides (Table 3 , 1a-1f). The highest yield was obtained in the coupling of iodobenzene and 1-iodonaphthalene (Table 3, 1b). The lowest yield was noted for p-iodotoluene (1c) and o-methoxy iodobenzene (1f), due to the steric hindrance of substrates. Among the tested phenylacetylene derivatives, the best result was obtained with 1-ethynyl-methylbenzene (1h). The yield of 1c was lower than that 1e pointing to the beneficial effect of the stronger donor group (OMe). However, when the substituents were in ortho position, the yields of 1d and 1f differed less. The presence of OMe group in the ortho position of the phenylacetylene ring only slightly reduced the yield of alkynone (1j, 1k), while significantly lower yield was obtained for the ortho-substituted iodobenzene substrate (1f). In general, the Pd/DNA catalyst shown good or very good efficiency in the formation of alkynones under low CO pressure. However, in the experiments with aryl bromides and aliphatic alkynes, no conversion was achieved. Carbonylative Sonogashira coupling was also performed with good results using Mo(CO)6 instead of CO gas. Thus, the desired product (1a) was obtained in 75 % yield in 3 h with catalyst K2 (Scheme 2 ). However, in most experiments with Mo(CO)6 the reaction selectivity was lower than with CO gas and some amount of 2a was formed (see ESI for more detail). Attempts of K2 recycling Attempts to isolate the K2 catalyst after catalytic reaction by centrifugation failed and therefore three different methods were used for the K2 recycling. In the first method, the new substrates were added to the dried catalyst after removal of the organic products formed in the first reaction. It was found that in the second run the yield dropped to 60 % and it remined almost the same in the third run. However, during the fourth run, a considerable decrease in activity was observed and the yield of 1a was only 8% (Fig. 4 ). In the second method, the new portion of substrates was added to the reaction solution without catalyst separation. The yield of 1a decreased stepwise from 93 % to 54 % in the third run. The third method was similar to the second one, but the difference consisted in the presence of additional DNA. Using this strategy it was possible to stabilize longer the higher catalytic activity. Although the second reaction produced 61 % of 1a, it increased to 80–83 % in the third and fourth run (Fig. 4). Thus, it can be assumed that DNA stabilized the catalytically active palladium, most probably leached from DNA. In order to get more information about the studied system the TEM analysis of K2 was performed after the fourth run. The average diameter of Pd NPs slightly decreased, with the maximum at ca. 3–4 nm (Figs. 5,6 ). This can indicate some dissolution of palladium and its leaching to the solution. A hot filtration test confirmed this assumption. In 2 h after the reaction had begun the Pd/DNA was separated by filtration through Celite. Next, filtrate was heated for 4 h at 80 °C under the CO balloon. While after 2 h the yield of the desired ketone was 15 %, it increased to 33 % in the end of this experiment. Thus, Pd species present in the reaction solution were catalytically active. Moreover, the ICP-MS confirmed the presence of 0.306 ppm palladium in the reaction solution after filtration. These results indicated that the soluble palladium forms participated in the catalytic reaction, in addition to Pd/DNA. Sonogashira coupling with Pd/DNA Considering the preliminary results obtained during the optimization of carbonylative Sonogahira coupling, we used Pd/DNA (K1-K3) catalysts for the synthesis of diphenylacetylene (Scheme 3 , Table 4 ). Interestingly, Pd/DNA (K1-K3) catalysts catalyzed well the Sonogashira reaction in an aqueous medium, with KOH as a base. Almost the same yield was obtained in all three cases. Thus, not like in the case of carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, the pre-reduction of palladium did not influence on the reaction course. Catalytic activity of the studied Pd/DNA catalysts was similar to that reported earlier [37]. However, in the studied systems shorter time (3 h versus 24 h) was sufficient to form diphenylacetylene in high yield. Moreover, a cheaper base, KOH, was used instead of Cs2CO3. Conclusions Pd/DNA catalysts catalyzed efficiently formation of alkynones under carbonylative Sonogashira conditions. The best results were obtained in DMF, under 1 atm of CO with Et3N as a base. The yield of product was significantly higher that with Pd/C or Pd(OAc)2 under the same conditions. The kind of DNA polymer influenced the reaction course and better results were obtained using low molecular weight DNA. The stability of the catalyst increased in the presence of DNA excess. This can be explained by the bonding of the leached palladium to the polymer and limitation of palladium nanoparticles aggregation. The Pd/DNA catalysts changed their selectivity at the presence of water and formed a Sonogashira product with a high yield. This effect can be related to the competition of water molecules with CO for the place in the palladium environment and non-effective CO activation. Advantageously, the Sonogashira coupling in our conditions was faster than that reported earlier [37]. CRediT authorship contribution statement M.
