Catalytic activity of several inorganic solid bases and an organic amine was compared for the reaction. The results show that potassium carbonate and triethylamine both exhibit high activity. The catalytic system of K 2 CO 3 -N(Et) 3 has higher propylene carbonate yield than that of either K 2 CO 3 or N(Et) 3 itself. Under the optimal reaction conditions, 98% o-chloropropanol conversion and 95% propylene carbonate selectivity were obtained on K 2 CO 3 -N(Et) 3 . Key words: carbon dioxide; o-chloropropanol; triethylamine; potassium carbonate; propylene carbonate Propylene carbonate (PC) has been used as an electrolyte in lithium batteries and an aprotic polar solvent in degreasing, paint stripping, and cleaning applications [1]. PC is also an important organic chemical intermediate [2]. The main use of PC is by its transesterification with methanol to form dimethyl carbonate and the corresponding propylene glycol [3–5]. Several methods for preparing PC have been studied, such as the phosgenation technique, carbonate transesterification, reaction of urea with propylene glycol [6], reaction of CO 2 with propylene glycol [7–9], and reaction of CO 2 with propylene oxide [10]. The reaction of CO 2 with propylene oxide is the main method used in industry, especially in China, where over 90% of PC is produced by it; however, propylene oxide needs to be produced from o-chloropropanol: In this work, a new route for the synthesis of propylene carbonate was studied. o-Chloropropanol was used as the raw material to react with CO 2 : o-Chloropropanol was prepared by putting anhydrous hy- drogen chloride into propylene glycerol. The contents of 1-chloro-2-propanol and 2-chloro-1-propanol were 75% and 20%, respectively. The reaction was carried out in a stainless autoclave reactor with an inner volume of 250 ml. A typical procedure was as follows. o-Chloropropanol, triethylamine, and carbonate salts were added to the autoclave equipped with a stirrer and temperature control device. The autoclave was sealed and flushed with CO 2 to flush out the air. The initial pressure was adjusted to 2.0 MPa at 373.15 K. After reaction for 3 h, the vessel was cooled to room temperature. The prod- ucts were analyzed by GC GC-112A with a PEG column 30 m u 0.32 mm u 0.5 μm and FID. Further identification was performed using GC-MS HP 6890/5973 . Several carbonate salts and triethylamine were investigated. The results are summarized in Table 1, which shows that the activity of potassium carbonate was higher than sodium car- ZHOU Xi et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 7–8 bonate. The activity of the alkali earth metal carbonates was much lower than the alkali metal carbonates even though the volume of the former was twice that of the alkali metal car- bonate (Entries 2–5). In addition, triethylamine also has high activity (Entry 8). This result shows that the catalytic activity increased with the basicity of the catalyst. Their activity is in the order of N(Et) 3 # K 2 CO 3 ! Na 2 CO 3 ! MgCO 3 ! CaCO 3 . These alkalis including the carbonate salts and organic amine were used as both catalysts and neutralization reagents in this reaction. The amount of alkali has a great effect on the PC yield. When the amount of alkali was lower than the equivalent of o-chloropropanol, all of the alkali was neutralized by HCl such that there was no alkali to catalyze the reaction. Thus, the conversion of o-chloropropanol was not high. The conversion of o-chloropropanol increased when the amount of alkali was increased, but the selectivity to PC decreased when the amount of alkali was too high (Entries 6–9). Also, it was observed that the conversion of 2-chloro-1-propanol was lower than that of 1-chloro-2-propanol when the amount of alkali was not enough (Entry 9). In other words, the reactivity of 1-chloro- 2-propanol was higher than that of 2-chloro-1-propanol. This may depend on the location of chlorine in the molecule. It is worth noting that when the ratio of K 2 CO 3 to o-chloropropanol was 0.5 or 1, the conversion of o-chloro- propanol was almost the same, but the selectivity for PC was quite different (Entries 1 and 2). The reason may be that when the ratio of K 2 CO 3 to o-chloropropanol was 0.5, K 2 CO 3 was used as a diacid base to neutralize HCl and produce H 2 O. Then PC hydrolysis occurred producing propylene glycol, and the selectivity for PC was low. When the ratio of K 2 CO 3 to o-chloropropanol was 1, K 2 CO 3 was used as a monoacid base, and no water was produced. Then, the selectivity to PC in- creased to 91%. In addition, Table 1 also shows that adding a little K 2 CO 3 in N(Et) 3 or a little N(Et) 3 in K 2 CO 3 gave a higher activity and selectivity than was obtained with either individually (Entries 10 and 11). The possible reason is that K 2 CO 3 and N(Et) 3 have a synergetic catalytic effect. Propylene oxide was not found in the product when triethylamine was used as the catalyst. There is a little of it when potassium carbonate was used as the catalyst. There may be different reaction mechanisms. This needs further research. In summary, a new route to synthesize PC was demonstrated. Compared with the method that uses propylene oxide, this route uses a more upstream raw material and give a higher yield under mild reaction conditions. It is a feasible method for the transformation of CO 2 . K 2 CO 3 and N(Et) 3 are efficient catalysts for the synthesis of PC from CO 2 and o-chloropro- panol. The catalytic system of K 2 CO 3 -N(Et) 3 showed a higher catalytic activity and selectivity than that of either K 2 CO 3 or N(Et) 3 alone. References [1] Sakakura T, Choi J-C, Yasuda H.
