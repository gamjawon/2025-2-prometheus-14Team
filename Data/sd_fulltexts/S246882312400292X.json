Herein, we represent detailed investigations on the support effects of Ag catalysts for dimethyl glycolate (DMO) semi-hydrogenation to methyl glycolate (MG), where G6 silica with amorphous mesopores, SBA-15 with parallel mesopores and silica nanospheres (MSNS) with center-radial ones were employed as the supports. The hydrogenation activity decreases in the order of Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 > Ag/G6 while the MG selectivity in the order of Ag/G6 > Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 at the same reaction conditions, indicating remarkable support effects on both activity and selectivity. Structural characterizations, temperature programmed experiments and in-situ FTIR of DMO adsorption experiments demonstrate that the weak confinement effect of G6 leads to the larger sized Ag nanoparticles and weakened activation of DMO and H2, which contributes to low hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the ordered mesoporous SBA-15 and MSNS deliver well confinement effects for Ag nanoparticles and the activation of DMO and H2, but the distinct pore structures result in different activation and diffusion behaviors. Finally, DMO conversion and MG yield are well correlated with the competitive adsorption of H2 versus DMO on Ag catalysts, indicating such competitivity as a descriptor for DMO semi-hydrogenation over Ag catalysts.

Introduction Methyl glycolate (MG), known as an important platform chemical, has been widely used for the synthesis of value-added chemicals such as biodegradable polyglycolic acid, medicament and other chemicals owing to the coexistence of ester and hydroxyl groups [1,2]. Semi-hydrogenation of dimethyl glycolate (DMO), derived from coal-based syngas, is emerging as promising route for the production of MG due to the high economic efficiency and environment-benign characteristics [3,4]. However, the semi-hydrogenation of DMO to MG is challenging because of the competitive reaction pathways, such as the over-hydrogenation to ethylene glycol (EG), the thermodynamic constant of which is two orders of magnitude larger than that of semi-hydrogenation to MG [5,6]. Thus, kinetics control based on highly efficient catalysts is significant for overcome the thermodynamical disadvantages the DMO hydrogenation to MG. Along this line, intensive efforts have been made to design and optimize the catalysts for DMO semi-hydrogenation to MG [7–9]. For instance, Ding and co-authors reported P modified Co/SiO2 catalyst for DMO semi-hydrogenation to MG, which exhibited 94.6 % of DMO conversion and 88.1 % of MG selectivity at low LHSV and high H2/DMO condition [10]. Yao et al. synthesized stable Cu sub-nanometric cluster catalysts via a low-temperature atomic diffusion process among which Cu3 clusters exhibited remarkable catalytic performance in semi-hydrogenation of DMO to MG [11]. Among these reported catalysts, the Ag/SiO2 catalysts outperformed others in the term of high MG yield owing to its weak hydrogenolysis activity of DMO, which effectively inhibits the over-hydrogenation to EG [12]. However, the weak affinity of Ag to H2 limits the hydrogenation activity, and thus high Ag loading is necessary for desirable DMO conversion [13,14], which would increase the cost of catalysts and the possibility of Ag sintering. To tackle these issues, numerous strategies have been propounded for boosting the catalytic performance of Ag catalyst in DMO semi-hydrogenation to MG, such as introducing second metal as promoter to regulate the electronic properties of Ag in order to enhance the activation of reactants [8,15]. Recently, mesoporous silicas with high surface area and tunable pore structures have been shown to be promising as the support for Ag catalysts, where the dispersion and size of Ag nanoparticles can be well controlled benefitting from the confinement of mesoporous structures [16–19]. Notably, the support has a great influence on the catalytic performance of the metal sites through electronic interaction spatial confinement [20–24]. Systematical investigations on support effects in Ag-catalyzed DMO semi-hydrogenation would bring more insights for guiding the design of high-performance catalysts. Herein, G6 silica with amorphous mesopores, SBA-15 with parallel mesopores and silica nanospheres (MSNS) with center-radial ones were employed as the supports for Ag catalysts here to examine the support effects on DMO semi-hydrogenation. Systematic characterization techniques were utilized to identify the distinct structures of supports and the corresponding active structures of Ag catalysts, i.e., Ag/G6, Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS. The structure characterizations results show that the ordered mesopores structures of SBA-15 and MSNS render spatial confinement and thus result in smaller sized Ag nanoparticles in comparison with G6. The hydrogenation activity decreases in the order of Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 > Ag/G6 while the MG selectivity in the order of Ag/G6 > Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 at the same reaction conditions, indicating remarkable support effects on both activity and selectivity. To gain mechanistic insights into the support effects, systematical temperature programmed experiments, including temperature programmed desorption of H2 and DMO (H2-TPD and DMO-TPD), and in-situ FTIR of DMO adsorption experiments were then conducted to study the activation and adsorption of reactants over these catalysts. The temperature programmed desorption of MG (MG-TPD) and temperature programmed surface reaction of MG (MG-TPSR) were also performed to reveal the adsorption/desorption behaviors of MG over these Ag catalysts to address the distinct MG selectivities. Moreover, linear correlations were established for the competitive adsorption of H2 versus DMO on Ag catalysts with DMO conversion and MG yield, indicating the competitivity of H2 versus DMO as an important descriptor to dominate DMO semi-hydrogenation to MG over Ag catalysts. Experimental sections Materials and synthesis The commercial SBA-15 and G6 silica were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (China) and Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd (Japan), respectively. Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), triethanolamine (TEA), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) with the purity of analytical reagent were purchased from Aladdin. The MSNS support with average size of ca. 90 nm was synthesized as described in previous studies [9,25]. Silica supported Ag catalysts with a nominal loading of 3.0 wt.% were prepared by impregnation method. Typically, each support was firstly calcined in 500 °C for 4 h to remove any impurities and then dried at 120 °C for 2 h before impregnation. Afterwards, a certain amount of AgNO3 solution with determined mass of AgNO3 was added onto the support dropwise under contiguous stirring and the mixture was then aged at room temperature in a dark place for 24 h. Finally, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 400 °C for 4 h under static air. The obtained catalysts were named as Ag/G6, Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS, respectively. Characterizations of the materials Unless specifically stated, all samples were pre-reduced at 350 °C with 50 mL min−1 of H2 at 1 °C min−1 heating rate for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature in H2 atmosphere before characterization. The actual Ag loadings were determined with ion-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an Agilent 5100 spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a NOVA Nano SEM450 microscope (FEI, USA) with an operating voltage of 3 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-filed scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained with Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin equipped with a digitally processed STEM imaging system. N2 physisorption measurements were carried out on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 20 kV and 20 mA with a scanning speed of 2 °/min. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were obtained on Lambda 950 UV–vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as reference. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis experiment for used catalysts was performed in O2 atmosphere on PerkinElmer Pyris 1 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 150 °C, holing at 150 °C for 10 min, and then continued heating from 150 to 850 °C. The H2-TPR experiment was conducted to determine the reducibility and metal-support interaction of catalysts on Micrometrics Autochem II 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In a typical run, about 100 mg of unreduced sample was loaded in the quartz U-type reactor and dried at 150 °C for 2 h under 50 mL min−1 of Ar flow and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the sample was reduced with 10 % v/v H2/Ar with 50 mL min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C and the consumption of H2 was recorded by the TCD. The H2-TPD experiment was carried out in a homemade FTIR-MS-TPA system equipped with mass spectrum (SRD200M PRO, TILON). Briefly, about 50 mg of fresh catalyst, placed in the middle U-type quartz tube, was reduced by 10 % v/v H2/Ar with 50 mL min−1 at 300 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the gas was switched to 30 mL min−1 of Ar until the baseline of mass spectrum (MS) signal was stabilized, and the temperature was raised from room temperature to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, during which the desorption species were monitored by the MS. The in-situ DMO-FTIR test was performed on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer in a transmission FTIR cell, which was equipped with CaF2 windows. Typically, about 25 mg of catalyst was pressed into a self-supported wafer (diameter ca. 13 mm) and then was reduced with 30 mL min−1 of 10 % v/v H2/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min to remove any impurities. Afterwards, the cell temperature was cooled to 220 °C with 30 mL min−1 of Ar and the background spectra was recorded. The DMO/methanol solution (5 wt.%) was pumped in preheater and vaporized at 180 °C and the gaseous DMO was then introduced into the cell with 30 mL min−1 of Ar until a saturated adsorption was achieved, followed with purging with Ar for another 30 min to remove the weakly adsorbed species. Finally, the FTIR spectra were recorded with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 and via the accumulation of 32 scans. DMO-TPD, MG-TPD and MG-TPSR tests were both conducted on FTIR-MS-TPA system equipped with mass spectrum (SRD200M PRO, TILON). In a typical run for DMO-TPD, 50 mg of catalyst was loaded in the middle U-type quartz tube and reduced with 50 mL min−1 of 10 % v/v H2/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min followed by switching the gas to Ar flow with 30 mL min−1 for 30 min, and then the sample was cooled to 200 °C in Ar atmosphere. Afterwards, the DMO/methanol solution (5 wt.%) was pumped to preheater, which was set at 180 °C in advance, and the vaporized DMO was carried by 30 mL min−1 of Ar onto the surface of catalyst until a saturated adsorption was achieved, followed with purging with Ar until the signal of MS was steady. Finally, the temperature was increased from 200 to 900 °C with 30 mL min−1 of Ar and the signal of desorbed species was collected and analyzed by MS. The experimental procedure of MG-TPD was similar to DMO-TPD except for introducing of MG onto the surface of catalyst by bubbling MG with 30 mL min−1 of Ar at 100 °C. The experimental steps of MG-TPSR were also similar to MG-TPD, in which the Ar gas was switched into 30 mL min−1 of 10 % v/v H2/Ar after saturated adsorption of MG was achieved and the temperature was increased from 100 to 850 °C. Catalytic evaluation The catalytic performances for DMO semi-hydrogenation were performed in a stainless fixed-bed tubular continuous flow reactor (10 mm inner diameter and 550 mm length) equipped with a computer-controlled auto-sampling system, and the detailed descriptions could be found in our previous works [9,12]. The reaction system was maintained for 2–3 h at every condition to ensure steady state was achieved before changing to next test condition. Then the values of DMO conversion and products selectivities at each steady state were calculated as follows: Conversion ( % ) = DMO ( inlet ) − DMO ( outlet ) DMO ( inlet ) × 10 0 % Selectivity ( % ) = MG ( outlet ) or EG ( outlet ) DMO ( inlet ) − DMO ( outlet ) × 100 % Results and discussion The morphologies of the SiO2 supports, i.e., MSNS, SBA-15 and G6, were first systematically characterized by SEM and TEM measurements. As depicted in Fig. S1 and Fig. 1 a, the synthesized MSNS features with nanospheres with a diameter of ca. 90 nm and center-radial mesopores of ca. 6 nm in pore size. Typical parallel channels with > 1000 nm in pore length are obviously seen in Fig. S2 and Fig. 1b, which are the representative characteristics of SBA-15 [26], while irregular porous characteristics are observed for the G6 silica (Fig. S3 and Fig. 1c). The morphologies of prepared Ag/SiO2 catalysts, i.e., Ag/MSNS, Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6, and the corresponding size of supported Ag particles were further resorted by TEM measurements. As seen in Fig. 1d, the Ag nanoparticles are mainly confined in the mesoporous channels in Ag/MSNS catalysts with a unform size distribution. The histogram of size distributions in Fig. 1g further demonstrates the uniform distribution of Ag nanoparticles in Ag/MSNS, and average size of Ag nanoparticles is around 3.7 nm. Similarly, as exhibited in Fig. 1e, the Ag nanoparticles in Ag/SBA-15 are also uniformly distributed within the parallel channels of SBA-15 with average size of 3.9 nm (Fig. 1h). However, on the Ag/G6 catalyst, a large quantity of Ag nanoparticles with much bigger size are clearly seen in HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1f), and the average size of Ag nanoparticles is around 6.2 nm (Fig. 1i). Considering the similar Ag loadings and the same synthesis procedure for fabricating these Ag/SiO2 catalysts, the different size of Ag nanoparticles could be caused by the distinct morphologies and pore structures of MSNS, SBA-15 and G6. The similar dispersion of Ag could be attributed to the similarly high surface area of SBA-15 and MSNS than G6 (Table S1) and the similarly strong metal-support interaction. N2-physisorption measurements were then employed to investigate the pore structures of MSNS, SBA-15, G6 and the corresponding supported Ag catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the adsorption–desorption isotherms of SBA-15 exhibit the typical type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop, and those of G6 shows type V isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop, suggesting the different pore size distributions [27]. However, the adsorption–desorption isotherms of MSNS show a combination of type II and type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of center diverging wedge-shaped slit pore structure [25]. It is noteworthy that the hysteresis loops of the Ag catalysts all shift to the position of lower relative pressure as compared to their corresponding supports, implying the decreased pore size after the deposition of Ag nanoparticles [28]. In addition, the similar type of adsorption–desorption isotherms between supports and Ag catalysts indicates that the deposition of Ag nanoparticles causes negligible influences on the morphologies and pore structures of MSNS, SBA-15 and G6. The determined pore volume and surface areas of these Ag catalysts are smaller than their corresponding supports (Table S1), and the pore diameters all decreases after the deposition of Ag impregnation (Fig. 2b), which both evidence the anchoring of Ag nanoparticles inside the pore of supports. These characterization results indeed confirm the distinct morphologies and pore structures among MSNS, SBA-15 and G6 and corresponding supported Ag catalysts. XRD and UV–vis DRS tests were conducted to further explore the morphologies and microstructures of the Ag catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, the XRD pattern of Ag/G6 shows two intense diffraction peaks at 38.2° and 44.3°, which are assigned to the diffraction of (111) and (200) planes of metallic Ag (JCPDS No. 04–0783) [29], respectively. In contrast, the diffraction peaks of Ag are hardly seen in the patterns of Ag/MSNS and Ag/SBA-15, suggesting the smaller sizes of Ag particles on both catalysts, which is also in agreement with the TEM results (Fig. 1). The different sizes of Ag particles were further confirmed by the UV–vis DRS spectra in Fig. 2d. The peak at 413 nm observed on the spectrum of Ag/G6 is assigned to the surface plasmon resonance peak of metallic Ag [30,31], which blue-shifts to 380 nm on the spectra of both Ag/MSNS and Ag/SBA-15, demonstrating smaller sized Ag nanoparticles on Ag/MSNS and Ag/SBA-15 [32]. These results evidence that MSNS and SBA-15 are more beneficial for stabilizing the Ag nanoparticles in the channels than G6 silica owing to the confinement effects of ordered mesoporous structures. The catalytic performances of Ag/MSNS, Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6 catalysts for DMO hydrogenation were comparatively investigated at the reaction temperature of 220 °C, pressure of 2.0 MPa and H2/DMO ratio of 100 under different LHSVs. DMO conversion over the Ag/G6 catalyst decreases gradually from 64.7 % to 16.7 % with increasing the LHSV from 0.25 to 1.5 h−1, while that over the Ag/MSNS catalyst maintains at ∼100 % at the full range of LHSV (Fig. 3 a), indicating superior hydrogenation activity of Ag/MSNS to Ag/G6. The Ag/SBA-15 shows similar DMO conversion to Ag/MSNS at low LHSV, i.e., 0.25 and 0.5 h−1, at which the DMO conversion is 97.4 % and 96.9 %, respectively. However, when the LHSV increases to 0.75 h−1, DMO conversion decreases quickly over Ag/SBA-15, which demonstrates lower hydrogenation activity of Ag/SBA-15 than Ag/MSNS. Moreover, the MG and EG selectivities were also compared under these different LHSV conditions in Fig. 3b-c. Due to the weak hydrogenation activity of Ag/G6, the selectivity to EG from the over-hydrogenation of DMO is much low, and the selectivity to MG is relatively high. The MG selectivity over Ag/MSNS and Ag/SBA-15 both gradually increase with the increasing LHSV since the decreasing residence time that alleviates the over-hydrogenation of DMO to EG. Notably, the MG selectivity of Ag/MSNS is higher than that of Ag/SBA-15 at the same LHSV, although the hydrogenation activity of Ag/SBA-15 is inferior to that of Ag/MSNS, which implies that the pore structures could associate with the catalysis process. The MG yields over these catalysts at different LHSVs are further compared in Fig. 3d. Clearly, the Ag/MSNS exhibits much higher MG yield than the Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6. Moreover, the MG yield over the Ag/MSNS increases with the LHSVs owing to the simultaneously increased hydrogenation activity and MG selectivity at higher LHSV. At the LHSV of 1.5 h−1, the full DMO conversion and 97 % of MG selectivity over Ag/MSNS give rise to the highest MG yield up to 97 %. In contrast, the MG yields over Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6 decrease gradually with increasing LHSV due to the quick decreasing DMO conversion with the increasing LHSV. Furthermore, the long-term stability tests were also conducted at LHSV of 0.75 h−1 for the Ag catalysts to address the difference in catalytic stability caused by the support effects. As shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S4, the DMO conversion and MG selectivity over Ag/MSNS remain at 99.3 % and ∼90 % during the 100-h test, respectively, indicating a high stability of Ag/MSNS. However, the DMO conversions decrease gradually with the time on stream from 88.9 % to 85.1 % over Ag/SBA-15 and from 52 % to 48 % over Ag/G6, respectively (Fig. 3e). Due to the gradually reduced hydrogenation activity as evidenced by the decreased DMO conversion with time on stream the selectivity to MG increases and that to EG decreases with time on stream over the Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6 (Figs. S5 and S6). The thermogravimetric (TG) analyses under O2 atmosphere were subsequently performed for the used catalysts after long-term stability tests to investigate the possible coke-deposition. As depicted in Fig. S7, the total weight loss of the spent Ag/MSNS is 8.77 %, which is lower than those of the spent Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6 (Figs. S8 and S9). These indicate the less coke deposition on Ag/MSNS than those on Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/G6, agreeing well with the observed higher stability with Ag/MSNS. As shown in Fig. S10, the average size of Ag nanoparticles in used Ag/G6 increased to 16.2 nm from 6.2 nm on the fresh Ag/G6, indicating the weak confinement of G6 for the Ag nanoparticles. As previously revealed, the catalytic performance of Ag catalyst for DMO semi-hydrogenation is highly depended on the size of Ag nanoparticles, and the activity decreases with the increasing Ag particle size in the range of ≥ 5.3 nm [12]. Therefore, the gradually decreased activity of Ag/G6 catalyst observed in stability test can be attributed to the increased size of Ag nanoparticles during reaction process. To unveil the effects of supports on the catalytic performances for DMO hydrogenation on these Ag catalysts, multiple characterization experiments were conducted to investigate the activation and adsorption of reactants. Firstly, the H2-TPR experiments were employed to explore the reducibility of Ag species and metal-support interaction. As depicted in Fig. 4 a, the maximum reduction temperature in the H2-TPR profile of Ag/G6 is located at 268 °C, which is attributed to the reduction of Ag+ species to metallic Ag [33]. In contrast, the reduction peak shifts to much higher temperature over Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS, suggesting stronger interactions between Ag species and support in Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS than that in Ag/G6 [34–36]. The different metal-support interactions among these Ag catalysts could be induced by the distinct confinement effects of the mesoporous channels [37]. Notably, the Ag species in Ag/SBA-15 show two reduction peaks at 268 and 346 °C, respectively. The former reduction peak, similar to that observed with the profile of Ag/G6, can be assigned to the reduction of Ag species located at outside or shallow channel of SBA-15 with weak metal-support interaction, while the latter one at 346 °C is owing to the reduction of Ag species well confined in the channels of SBA-15 with strong metal-support interaction [17,18]. However, the profile of Ag/MSNS shows only one reduction peak concentrated at 358 °C, implying the well dispersion of Ag nanoparticles confined in the center-radial mesopores of MSNS with the similarly strong metal-support interaction. The H2-TPR results demonstrate that different morphologies of mesoporous channel lead to distinct confinement effects, resulting in different metal-support interaction as well as size distributions of Ag nanoparticles. H2-TPD experiments were then performed to analyze the adsorption and activation of hydrogen on these Ag catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4b, the H2-TPD profiles of Ag/G6 and Ag/SBA-15 both exhibit two desorption signals at 115 and 153 °C, where the first peak is ascribed to the desorption of H2 adsorbed on Ag nanoparticles [35] and the latter one is ascribed to the desorption of H2 adsorbed on the interface between Ag and silica support [38]. In contrast, the two desorption peaks shift to higher temperature, i.e., 123 and 172 °C, in the profile of Ag/MSNS, suggesting the stronger adsorption of H2 on Ag/MSNS. Notably, the desorption of hydrogen spillover from active sites to the support in the high-temperature range (400–800 °C) varies notably among these catalysts [39–41]. Specifically, the desorption of such hydrogen species occurs at 522 °C for Ag/G6, which is increased to 544 and 570 °C for Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Table S2, the peak areas of spillovered hydrogen decrease in the order of Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 > Ag/G6, which is in good accordance with the decreasing order of activity of these catalysts (Fig. 3), indicating that spillovered hydrogen is vital to the hydrogenation of DMO. Furthermore, the total area of H2 desorption peak for Ag/SBA-15 is much smaller than those for Ag/G6 and Ag/MSNS (Table S2). Our previous work well showed that the diffusion process in the longer channels of SBA-15 is not favorable, which leads to that the Ag sites inside the pores of SBA-15 are difficult to be accessible for H2 molecules [9]. Thus, the smaller area of H2 desorption peak for Ag/SBA-15 can be attributed to the unfavorable accessibility of Ag sites for H2 in the long channels of SBA-15. In-situ FTIR spectra of DMO adsorption provide information on the activation of DMO over catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4c, the peaks at 1772 and 1748 cm−1 are attributed to stretching vibration of C=O in ester moiety of DMO and stretching vibration of C=O bond in ester moiety of dissociated DMO species on Ag/G6, i.e., CH3OC(O)-C(O)-, respectively [7,42], while the peaks at 1462 and 1436 cm−1 are attributed to the CH3 deformation [43,44]. In contrast, the characteristic peaks associated with C=O bond vibrations in the spectrum of Ag/MSNS red-shift from 1772 to 1748 cm−1 to 1770 and 1743 cm−1, respectively, together with increases in the peak intensities, indicating the stronger chemisorption of DMO over Ag/MSNS. In the spectrum of Ag/SBA-15, the C=O bond vibrations are observed at 1770 and 1747 cm−1 and the intensity of peak at 1747 cm−1 is clearly weaker than that seen with the Ag/MSNS, pointing to the weaker activation of DMO than that over Ag/MSNS. DMO-TPD experiments were further carried out to gain more details on the adsorption of DMO (Fig. 4d). A wide desorption peak concentrated at 585 °C is clearly observed on TPD profile of Ag/G6, but the desorption peak shifts to 660 °C in the profile of Ag/MSNS, further indicating the stronger chemisorption of DMO on Ag/MSNS than that on Ag/G6. Interestingly, the TPD profile of Ag/SBA-15 demonstrates two peaks at 530 and 665 °C, where the former one can be assigned to the desorption of weakly-adsorbed DMO on the Ag nanoparticles with weak metal-support interaction and the latter one to that of much stronger chemisorption of DMO on Ag nanoparticles anchored inside the channel of SBA-15. However, Ag species anchored in channels of SBA-15 would lead to higher diffusion barrier for DMO to access Ag active sites, which was quantitatively evidenced by the much smaller total peak area of DMO-TPD profile of Ag/SBA-15 than those of Ag/MSNS and Ag/G6 (Table S2). Notably, the desorption of DMO and H2 is occurred at similar temperature regions (Fig. 4b-d), pointing to the possible presence of competitive-adsorption of DMO and H2, which was also shown by theoretical calculations on adsorption of DMO and H2 on Ag catalysts in our previous works [45]. To unravel the underlying relationship between activation/adsorption of reactants and catalytic performance in DMO semi-hydrogenation, the correlation between DMO conversion and the competitive-adsorption of H2 versus DMO was subsequently explored. The peak areas of the desorption peaks in the DMO-TPD and H2-TPD profiles were calculated (Table S2), and then the ratio of H2-TPD peaks to that of DMO-TPD, named as AH/ADMO, was obtained for these Ag catalysts. DMO conversion obtained on these Ag catalysts is plotted against the AH/ADMO in Fig. 5 a to show the relationship between the activity and the competitive-adsorption of H2 versus DMO. Clearly, a good linear correlation is seen for these Ag catalysts, and the DMO conversion increases with the increasing AH/ADMO, indicating that the high AH/ADMO is more favorable for the DMO conversion. In addition, the MG yield is also plotted with the AH/ADMO in Fig. 5b, where the MG yield also linearly increases with the AH/ADMO. This is in good accordance with the normally high molar H2/DMO ratio used in the performance test to ensure high DMO conversion and MG yield, which is mainly due to the weakness of H2 in the competitive-adsorption between DMO and H2 on Ag catalysts [45,46]. MG-TPD tests were conducted to investigate the adsorption of MG in these Ag catalysts to address the difference in MG selectivity. As seen in Fig. 5c, the desorption profile of MG from Ag/G6 can be deconvoluted into three peaks, where the first two peaks are assigned to the desorption of methoxyl group (CH3O*) and moiety species from the dissociative adsorption of MG, respectively [11]. Moreover, the desorption peak at 673 °C could be resulted from the ionization of desorbed species from the decomposition of MG in mass spectrometer. Furthermore, a shift from 386 to 420 °C is seen in the desorption of CH3O* over Ag/MSNS while the total area for desorption of MG of Ag/MSNS is much larger in comparison with that of Ag/G6 (Table S3), indicating the stronger adsorption of MG over Ag/MSNS. However, the desorption temperatures of both CH3O* and moiety of chemisorbed MG further shift to higher temperatures over Ag/SBA-15, suggesting the stronger adsorption of MG on Ag/SBA-15 than that on Ag/MSNS. Notably, the total area of MG desorption of Ag/SBA-15 is also smaller than Ag/MSNS (Table S3), which evidences the less of MG adsorbed on Ag/SBA-15, probably due to the presence of diffusion barrier of MG in Ag/SBA-15. The strong adsorption of MG and diffusion barrier for MG are beneficial for the over-hydrogenation of MG to EG on Ag/SBA-15. MG-TPSR experiments were further performed to understand the support effects on MG selectivity over these catalysts. As reported in previous studies [11,42], the over-hydrogenation of MG to EG occurs with the dissociative adsorption of MG to form CH3O* that can be hydrogenated. Therefore, tracing the signal of CH3O* during the TPSR process is beneficial for distinguishing the hydrogenation ability of chemisorbed MG over these Ag catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the MG-TPSR profile of Ag/G6 shows the desorption of H2O and CH4 resulted from the hydrogenation of CH3O*, and the desorption temperature of formed H2O and CH4 are centric at 366 and 456 °C, respectively. In contrast, the desorption peaks of H2O and CH4 shift to higher temperature for Ag/MSNS and Ag/SBA-15. Moreover, the peak areas of H2O desorption increase in the order of Ag/G6 < Ag/MSNS < Ag/SBA-15, in good accordance with the increasing order of EG selectivity of these catalysts (Fig. 3c). These MG-TPD and MG-TPSR results clearly demonstrate that the morphologies of supports affect the product distributions via changing the activation of both reactants and targeted MG molecules. Conclusions In summary, we have presented mechanistic insights into support effects on the DMO hydrogenation over Ag catalysts supported on G6, SBA-15 and MSNS. As reveal by the structure characterizations, the ordered mesopores structures of SBA-15 and MSNS render spatial confinement and thus results in smaller sized Ag nanoparticles in comparison with G6. The hydrogenation activity decreases in the order of Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 > Ag/G6 while the MG selectivity in the order of Ag/G6 > Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 at the same reaction conditions, indicating remarkable support effects on both activity and selectivity. Temperature programmed experiments, including H2-TPD and DMO-TPD, and in-situ FTIR of DMO adsorption experiments were employed to demonstrate the effects of supports on activation and diffusion of reactants. It is found that the weak confinement effect of G6 leads to the larger sized Ag nanoparticles and weakened activation of DMO and H2 on Ag/G6, which contributes to low hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the ordered mesoporous structures of SBA-15 and MSNS deliver well confinement effects for Ag nanoparticles, but the distinct pore structures of Ag/SBA-15 and Ag/MSNS result in different activation and diffusion behaviors for both reactants and targeted MG. Specifically, the strong adsorption and high diffusion barrier of MG in Ag/SBA-15 favor the over-hydrogenation of DMO to EG. Finally, linear correlations have been established for the competitive adsorption of H2 versus DMO on Ag catalysts with DMO conversion and MG yield, indicating the competitivity of H2 versus DMO as an important descriptor to dominate DMO semi-hydrogenation to MG over Ag catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Support materials play vital roles in heterogenous catalysis via the so-called support effects, and understanding on the support effects is beneficial for the design of high-performance catalysts. Herein, we represent detailed investigations on the support effects of Ag catalysts for dimethyl glycolate (DMO) semi-hydrogenation to methyl glycolate (MG), where G6 silica with amorphous mesopores, SBA-15 with parallel mesopores and silica nanospheres (MSNS) with center-radial ones were employed as the supports. The hydrogenation activity decreases in the order of Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 > Ag/G6 while the MG selectivity in the order of Ag/G6 > Ag/MSNS > Ag/SBA-15 at the same reaction conditions, indicating remarkable support effects on both activity and selectivity. Structural characterizations, temperature programmed experiments and in-situ FTIR of DMO adsorption experiments demonstrate that the weak confinement effect of G6 leads to the larger sized Ag nanoparticles and weakened activation of DMO and H2, which contributes to low hydrogenation activity. In contrast, the ordered mesoporous SBA-15 and MSNS deliver well confinement effects for Ag nanoparticles and the activation of DMO and H2, but the distinct pore structures result in different activation and diffusion behaviors. Finally, DMO conversion and MG yield are well correlated with the competitive adsorption of H2 versus DMO on Ag catalysts, indicating such competitivity as a descriptor for DMO semi-hydrogenation over Ag catalysts.",
