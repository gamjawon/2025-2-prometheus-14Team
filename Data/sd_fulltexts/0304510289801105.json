B. LAPINA, A. V. SIMAKOV, V. M. MASTIKHIN, S. A. VENIAMINOV and A. A. SHUBIN Institute of Catalysis, Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk 630 090 (U.S.S.R.) (Received January 20, 1988; accepted September 26, 1988) Summary Vanadium-magnesium supported catalysts and model compounds (magnesium vanadates) have been studied with use of \"V NMR. It has been established that on the catalyst surface there exist isolated tetrahedral and octahedral vanadium species, their associated forms and magnesium ortho- vanadate. Their relative concentrations were determined by both the surface concentration of vanadium and the nature of modifying agents (such as S042\"). The influence of CO; and H^O adsorption and catalyst reduction with butene-1 on the vanadium coordination state has been studied. Introduction Vanadium-magnesium catalysts are widely used in the oxidative de- hydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1, 2]. The nature and the structure of the active form of these catalysts have been studied by means of various physical methods [3-5]. In particular, such phases as VO, Vz04, V203 have not been found by X-ray, IR and Raman spectroscopies. The V^ phase appears at vanadium contents higher than 20 wt.%. According to the electron micro- scopy data, the active phase at low vanadium content is highly distributed. At higher vanadium content (from 10 wt.% V) the magnesium orthovanadate Mg3(V04)2 phase is found by X-ray. According to IR and Raman spectra, there are tetrahedral, octahedral and square pyramidal coordinated vanadium species. According to the ESR data [3, 6], there are two types of tetravalent vanadium (isolated and associated) ions in the catalyst. \"V NMR provides valuable information about the structure of the local vanadium coordination [7, 8], allowing quantitative estimation of the content of the observed forms. The aim of the present work is to characterize the above vanadium forms by means of \"V NMR, and to elucidate their relative concentrations, ratios and interaction with the reaction products. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 56 Experimental Magnesium vanadates were prepared by melting a mixture of MgO and V^Os in stoichiometric ratio under specific temperature conditions by the method described in [9]. Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of MgO with an aqueous solution of NH4VC>3 followed by drying and calcination [10]. The vanadium content in the samples was varied from 0.5 to 10 wt.%. \"V NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker CXP-300 spectrometer in a magnetic field of 7.04 T at 78.86 MHz in the frequency range 100 - 200 kHz with a radio frequency pulse duration of 1 ^is and with a pulse repeti- tion rate of 0.1 -10 Hz. The used scan accumulation number was from 103 to 105. The chemical shift in the \"V NMR spectra was measured relative to the VOC13 signal. We used the sample magic-angle spinning method (MAS) at frequency 4 - 5 kHz in plastic rotors. MAS spectra of outgassed samples and samples after adsorption treatment were obtained by using sealed sample tubes placed in the rotors, as in [II], at frequencies of 2 - 3 kHz. ESR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ER-200 D X-band spectrom- eter with 100 kHz modulation at 298 and 77 K. Adsorption of CO^ and H^O was carried out in an ordinary vacuum installation at room temperature. Results and discussion To study the vanadium state in catalysts, it is necessary to obtain \"V NMR spectra of all compounds which can exist in the V^Os-MgO system. Spectra of the individual magnesium vanadates were recorded. Four magnesium vanadates (orthovanadate Mg3(V04)2, pyrovanadates o^-Mg^V\\0i and metavanadate Mg(V03)2) are stable at room temperature in the V^Os-MgO system. The orthovanadate is composed of the isolated nearly tetrahedral species V04 with an average V 0 distance of 1.729 A [12]. In pyrovanadates, the tetrahedral species VC>4 are linked by the tops, forming V^C^2\" fragments with nonequivalent vanadium atoms [13]. a- and (3-Mg2V207 differ in various distortions of the tetrahedral species. In metavanadate, the vanadium atom has a strongly distorted octahedral environment with respect to oxygen [14]. \"V NMR spectra of some of the magnesium vanadates were given in [15]. Spectra were recorded at low frequency (16 MHz), which leads to values of the quadrupole interaction parameters rather than to the compo- nent values of the chemical shift tensor, which, as shown in [8], more correctly reflect the local environment of the vanadium nucleus. The spectra obtained at high frequency (79 MHz in our case) are not complicated by quadrupole effects, which allows us to obtain data on the nuclei magnetic shielding tensor. The difference in the structure of the local environment of vanadium atoms in individual vanadates leads to various \"V NMR spectra 57 (Table 1, Fig. 1). The \"V NMR spectrum of orthovanadate is nearly isotro- pic, with the chemical shift 6 = 557 ppm (relative to VOCI^ see Fig. la). In the case of pyrovanadates, \"V NMR spectra consist of two different lines due to nonequal vanadium atoms (see Fig. Ib, c). Metavanadate has a spectrum with three-dimensional anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor (Fig. Id), one of the tensor components strongly differing from the other two. With the sample magic-angle spinning, it is possible to determine the isotropic chemical shift values of all vanadium atoms, including non- equivalent ones. These values and the main values of the chemical shift tensor are listed in Table 1. Thus, individual magnesium vanadates have their characteristic \"V NMR spectra, which allows these data to be used in the analysis of surface species in catalysts. In the ESR spectra recorded at 77 K of the catalysts treated in 0; at 773 K, a signal with parameters g^ = 1.95, A n = 170 G is observed which was attributed to V(IV) in distorted tetrahedral oxygen environment as in [5]. The amount of tetravalent vanadium observed does not exceed 2 - 5% of the total vanadium content. \"V NMR spectra of the catalysts with various vanadium content are illustrated in Fig. 2. The catalyst samples were outgassed before recording the spectra. The method of sample magic-angle spinning was used to separate the individual lines. Analysis of these spectra allows one to conclude that the catalyst spectra consist of the following lines (the computer-simulated lines are presented in Fig. 3.): Line A. A narrow isotropic line with a chemical shift of ~ 480 ppm is observed at low vanadium concentration. Its intensity decreases as the vana- dium content increases (see Figs. 2, 3, 4). This line is characterized by the large value of the spin-lattice relaxation time. Line B has an axial anisotropy of the chemical shift, with parameters 5^ = 340 ppm, 5n = 900 ppm. This line is observed in all the spectra recorded without sample spinning. Due to the large line width this line is not narrowed under sample spinning, and because of the relatively low line intensity this line is not observed in the MAS spectra. This line broadens with increasing vanadium content. Line C is characterized by a width of ~15 kHz and isotropic chemical shift of ~ 570 ppm. It appears in the spectra as the vanadium content rises above 2 wt.%, and predominates at 3 wt.% V. Line D. The line width is about 15 kHz and the line isotropic chemical shift is equal to 580 ppm. The chemical shift anisotropy is nearly axial and is characterized by 5^= 510 ppm, 6n = 720 ppm. This line predominates at 5 - 7 wt.%. Line E. Its chemical shift is equal to 557 ppm and its width is ~7 kHz. This line appears at 5 wt.% V and predominates as the vanadium content increases. Line E can be attributed to the ortho- vanadate phase, since its parameters coincide with those for Mg3(V04)2. 58 TABLE 1 Parameters of the \"V NMR chemical shift tensor of magnesium vanadates8 Compound Note -83 -5i -5 AS 1*0 Mg3(V04)2 557 557 557 557 0 a-MgzV^ VI 510 570 585 555 75 V2 570 580 700 617 130 ^Mg2V,07 VI 460 560 680 560 220 V2 590 660 700 650 110 a-Mg(V03)2 310 470 950 576 640 e^Qq h-1 = 6.79 MHz \"Accuracy of measurements: 5i, 63 ( 30 ppm); ^( 10 ppm); A5= 3 6i ( 60 ppm); 5i,(,( 3 ppm from MAS).

MAS spectra obtained by the MAS method are given below. Parameters of lines A - D differ from those for all known magnesium vanadates. The attribution of lines A - D was made on the basis of literature data [8, 11]. It was shown in those papers that three-dimensional anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor is typical for vanadium in a tetrahedral oxygen environment. The line with axial anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor is observed for vanadium in a distorted octahedral oxygen coordination. The anisotropy value (A8 = 8n 8^ for axial symmetry; A 8 = 83 81 for the fully asymmetrical 8-tensor) characterizes the structure distortion. Line A, which is observed at low vanadium content, can be compared to the vanadium ions in nearly tetrahedral oxygen environments. The value of dipole-dipole interaction as seen from the width of line A (Fig. 3) does not exceed 1 kHz, which indicates that the vanadium atoms are isolated from each other (for vanadium in VzOs this value is equal to 3 kHz [16]). Line B having an axial anisotropy of the chemical shift tensor refers to vanadium in a distorted octahedral environment with respect to oxygen. It is also characterized by the small value of the dipole-dipole interaction (see Fig. 3). 60 OF =1KHz A,, <5^ --340pp.m. da '-900 ppm OF SKHz A, -440ppm ^..STOppm, d,.-700ppni col.cul.ated A+BtC OF .

In all cases e^qQ h~1 = 0, t? = 0. DF = dipole line width. Line C, with a chemical shift of about 570 ppm, can be attributed to vanadium in the tetrahedral oxygen environment. Line D (with axial anis- otropy of the chemical shift tensor) can be referred to vanadium in the dis- torted octahedral environment with respect to oxygen. The value of dipole- dipole interaction for the two lines C and D is higher than for lines A and B, and is equal to 2 - 3 kHz (Fig. 3). This indicates that the distance V V is shorter than that for lines A and B. Based on this fact, it is possible to con- clude that vanadium atoms seem to associate. The H^O and CO^ adsorption (Figs. 6, 7) leads to a change in the intensity of lines (A - D) and in the chemical shift values. Therefore, lines A - D can be attributed to vanadium surface species. The dependence of the relative content of the above species on the vanadium content in the catalysts as obtained from NMR spectra is repre- sented in Fig. 4. The estimated error is about 20%. Thus, on the catalyst surface there exist various pentavalent vanadium species which differ in the structure of their local environment. At low vanadium content, V(V) forms isolated tetrahedral (line A) and octahedral (line B) surface complexes, which form associated surface species as the vanadium content increases. In these associated species, vanadium may exist in both tetrahedral (line C) and octahedral (line D) environments.

Dependence of the relative content of observed vanadium forms on the vanadium content in catalysts. 1,2= tetrahedral and octahedral isolated species; 3,4= tetrahedral and octahedral associated species; 5 = magnesium orthovanadate. Values of relative contents represented here were estimated from the spectra, with estimated error ~20%. the local vanadium environment in isolated species differs from that in asso- ciated ones. This is indicated by the difference in their chemical shift values. For tetrahedral ions the association leads to distortion, but for the octa- hedral ones it results in a more symmetrical oxygen environment. Further increase in the vanadium content leads to the formation of Mg3(VC>4)2, which predominates at high vanadium concentrations. The value of the surface vanadium concentration affects the ratio of various vanadium forms. A decrease in surface area at constant vanadium content leads to an increase in the amount of associated species. To increase the activity and to stabilize the catalyst, Cd, K, Mg sulfates were added. The \"V NMR spectra of catalysts (2.6 wt.% V) containing various amounts of admixtures are illustrated in Fig. 5. The addition of sul- fates markedly decreases the amount of isolated tetrahedral vanadium spe- cies, which results in a decrease in the 480 ppm line intensity. Simulta- neously such an addition increases the amount of octahedral vanadium, which is indicated by the broad line intensity increase in the signal base (Fig. 5-3). It was mentioned above that components of the reaction media (H^O, CO;) also affect the state of surface vanadium. Adsorption of water (Fig. 6) at 298 K (water coverage is equal to 100% of monolayer; the catalyst 2.6 and 2.06 wt.% V) results in the disappearance of line A and shifting of line C to a lower field. The MAS spectra analysis for the catalyst (2.6 wt.% V) indi- cates that the adsorbed water is coordinated by vanadium surface complexes, with the formation of vanadium states having a higher coordination number 62 -480 0 -500 -1000 p.p.m., 5 Fig. 5. \"V NMR spectra (frequency 78.86 MHz, pulse duration 1 JUS, relaxation delay 0.1 -1 s) of the catalysts (catalyst specific area -60 - 70 m g\"1, vanadium content is about 2.6 wt.%) containing sulfates of K, Cd, Mg.

This process leads, in one case, to water coordina- tion by isolated tetrahedral species with the formation of distorted octa- hedral complexes, which is indicated by disappearance of the 480 ppm line (see Fig. 6, spectrum MAS-1). In another case, water is coordinated by the surface vanadium complexes in the second coordination sphere of the V- atom. This results in an increase of the V 0 bond length, which is likely to be due to hydrogen bonding of water with oxygen in the first coordination 63 sphere of the V-atom. This process is reflected in the 570 ppm line shift to lower 550 ppm field (see spectra MAS-1, 3 Fig. 6). COz introduction on the outgassed sample (Fig. 7, spectra 1, MAS-1) results in a change in the spectrum (Fig. 7, spectra 2, MAS-2, CO; is about 60% of monolayer). The signal intensity decreases. As a result of CO; adsorption, significant line broadening and line shift to lower field are observed ( 570 ppm -> 560 ppm). Surface vanadium complexes with CO; seem to be formed. The observed changes in the local vanadium environment which occur after CO; and HyO adsorption are reversible. Sample outgassing at 773 K leads again to the initial spectra.

As can be seen from Fig. 8, the reduction changes significantly the line shape and shows more clearly the line from Mg3(VC>4)2. One can expect that the most active vanadium forms are the first to react (i.e. disappear from the \"V NMR spectra). Therefore, in contrast with [3], magnesium orthovanadate is thought to react more slowly than surface clusters (dashed line). Conclusion Thus, the existence of a large number of vanadium coordination states on the catalyst surface was established by means of \"V NMR. Their relative concentrations are determined by both the vanadium surface concentration (as can be seen in Fig. 4) and the nature of modifying agents (such as SC^2\", Fig. 5). Firstly, the isolated tetrahedral and octahedral surface vanadium species appear at low vanadium content. At the range of 3 - 7 wt.% V, asso- ciated vanadium forms predominate. The phase of Mg3(V04); appears at 5 wt.% V and predominates at higher vanadium concentration. The different behavior of various vanadium forms on adsorption of CO; and H^O and reduction with butene-1 allows one to conclude that different vanadium forms are characterized by different activities in reaction (for example CO oxidation or butene oxidation). The influence of the reaction products (such as CO;, H;0) on the vanadium coordination state allows us to conclude that reaction conditions change the catalyst state and, therefore, its activity.

Appendix m this paper chemical shifts for the \"V nucleus are represented without any corrections on the second order quadrupole shift, because the exact values of the quadrupole interaction parameter (e^qQ h~1) are un- known. Figure 9 shows a simulated MAS \"V NMR spectrum. It is seen that for the e^Q h~1 = 5 MHz the second order quadrupole shift is equal to 9.7 ppm to the higher field. This shift is proportional to (e'gQ h\"1)2 and there- 65 p.p.m. 50 0 -50 -100p.p.m.,S' Fig. 9.

According to [17], for metavanadates LiV03 and NaV03 the quadrupole parameter is equal to 2.37 MHz and 3.94 MHz, respectively. However, for orthovanadates LiaVOs and VSa^VOy this value is equal to 1.5 MHz and 1.05 MHz, respect- ively. Thus, we can expect that for the catalyst species which are comparable with orthovanadate-type compounds, the quadrupole parameter is less than 5 MHz. Hence, the second order quadrupole correction is of the order 0.4 - 3 ppm. References 1 R. N. Volkov, V. P. Panova, I. P. Belomestnykh, G. V. Shakhnovitch and G. V.

Lapina A.V. Simakov V.M. Mastikhin S.A. Veniaminov A.A. Shubin Institute of Catalysis, Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk 630 090 U.S.S.R. Vanadium-magnesium supported catalysts and model compounds (magnesium vanadates) have been studied with use of 51V NMR. It has been established that on the catalyst surface there exist isolated tetrahedral and octahedral vanadium species, their associated forms and magnesium orthovanadate. Their relative concentrations were determined by both the surface concentration of vanadium and the nature of modifying agents (such as SO4 2−). The influence of CO2 and H2O adsorption and catalyst reduction with butene-1 on the vanadium coordination state has been studied. References 1 R.N. Volkov V.P. Panova I.P. Belomestnykh G.V.
