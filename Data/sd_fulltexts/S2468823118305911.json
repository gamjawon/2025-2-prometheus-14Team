Graphical abstract The effect of the support (ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2) of Rh (1 wt%) catalysts for the hydrogenation of m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB) in liquid phase was studied. The catalysts were reduced at 300 °C and characterized by EDS, TPR, TEM, N2 Adsorption, H2 chemisorption, XPS and Pyr-FTIR. Occurrence of partially reduced Rh species and metallic Rh is different among catalysts as evidenced by XPS. A typical SMSI effect was observed in Rh/TiO2 catalyst according to comparison of Hydrogen chemisorption and TEM results. Kinetic analysis of the m-DNB hydrogenation showed that the first step hydrogenation rate (m-DNB to m-NA, kinetic constant k 1) is faster than the second one (m-NA to m-PDA, kinetic constant k 2) and this depending on the catalyst. m-DNB preferentially adsorbs on electron deficient sites provided by Rhn+ species present in Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/TiO2 catalysts and depending on the relative amount of this sites the m-DNB is partially hydrogenated to m-NA. A direct correlation of k 2/k 1 ratio with the amount of Rh° was found. Keywords m-dinitrobenzene Electron deficient sites Hydrogenation Rhodium 1 Introduction The catalytic hydrogenation of substituted aromatic nitro compounds is a method for the production of substituted anilines which represent important intermediates in the manufacture of numerous organic molecules and are primarily used in the synthesis of substituted aromatic amines [1]. With conventional metal supported catalysts, the hydrogenation of this type of compounds is considered a structure-insensitive reaction [2,3], but is strongly affected by the type of support employed [2,4,5]. A clear example on this respect is the behavior of Pt supported on TiO2 or Al2O3 catalysts which is radically different in the hydrogenation of m-nitrostyrene [2]. On Pt/TiO2 catalyst the NO group is preferentially hydrogenated due to adsorption on the decorated Pt surface, while on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogenation of both, the CC group and nitro group of m-nitrostyrene takes place [2]. The hydrogenation of substituted aromatic nitrobenzenes also is highly dependent on the substituent group, i.e. the reaction in the presence of electron-withdrawing ring substituents increases the hydrogenation rate; on the contrary with donating substrates the hydrogenation reaction is not favored [6]. Thus, the hydrogenation of m-dinitrobenzene in conventional catalysts led to preferential hydrogenation of -NO2 groups; while, in the hydrogenation of m-nitrostyrene, the hydrogenation of the CC group is preferential. In the case of m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB) the exclusive formation of m-nitroaniline (m-NA) (partial reduction) is observed instead of m-phenylendiamine (m-PDA) (total reduction) [4,5,7]; not only a control of selectivity is observed but also the undesirable formation of compounds as hydroxylamine is avoided. On the contrary, supported metal catalysts as Ni [8], Pt [9], Ir [6], Ru [10], and, Pd [11] in m-DNB hydrogenation led to m-PDA, and efforts to direct the reaction to m-NA have been undertaken through metal cation additives [10,12] or modification of the nature of the active site through the well-known SMSI effect [4]. Rh is of great interest due to its high hydrogenation capacity, so it is possible to develop a very active and selective catalyst that overcomes its high cost. On the other hand, catalytic performance of Rh for the hydrogenation of m-DNB has been scarce published, compared to other nitroaromatic compounds like nitroacetophenone [13], nitrostyrene [14] and nitroarenes [15]. Only, the photocatalytic reduction of m-DNB on Rh/TiO2 has been reported and it produces m-NA as a major product [16]. The influence of the support to achieve the preferential hydrogenation to m-NA or m-PDA should be also considered [4,5,17], principally due to differences of m-DNB adsorption on active catalytic sites with distinct electronic density. In this work, the effect of ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 as support of Rh catalysts was explored due to possible differences in the type of metal site obtained. TiO2 is well recognized by its strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect which occurs at low reduction temperatures [18–20] 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All reactive grade solvents and reagents were purchased from different companies and used without further purification; m-DNB (Merck, 975%), m-NA (Aldrich, 98%), m-PDA (Merck, 99%). acetone (J. T. Baker, 99%) and ethanol (J. T. Baker, 99%). The precursors used were rhodium (III) acetylacetonate (Aldrich, 97%), Zirconium(IV) oxynitrate hydrate (Aldrich, 99.9%), and SiO2 (Grace Davison), TiO2 (Evonik, Aeroxide P-25), Al2O3 (Alúmina S.A), as supports were commercial available. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Tetragonal ZrO2 was prepared dissolving 66.06 g of ZrO(NO3)2 and 60 g of CO(NH3)2 in 90 mL H2O and then added to 900 mL of H2O. Subsequently, 30 mL of an aqueous NH3.H2O solution was added dropwise and the mixture was refluxed for 5 h. The obtained solid was washed for 3 times with hot deionized H2O in the centrifuge, dried in a rotary evaporator at 100 °C for 12 h and finally crushed. The supports (ZrO2, Al2O3 and TiO2) were sieved to mesh size 100 (150 μm) and subsequently calcined at 400 °C for 4 h using a heating ramp of 5 °C/min. Catalysts with a nominal 1 wt% Rh content were prepared by impregnation of each support with the appropriate amount of rhodium (III) acetylacetonate precursor. In a typical experiment, 2.97 g of support and 0.1203 g of rhodium (III) acetylacetonate in acetone, were mixed and stirred at 150 rpm for 40 min at room temperature [21]. The resulting solid was dried at 50 °C under vacuum and then calcined at 400 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C/min in air flow of 50 mL /min. The materials were labelled as Rh/TiO2, Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/ZrO2. 2.3 Characterization methods Rh content in the samples was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using an Oxford-ISIS detector coupled to a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-5900-LV). The average metal loading was reported in grams of metal per gram of sample after analysis of 25 different areas of each sample. Surface area was determined by N2 adsorption at −196 °C in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. The calcined samples were previously degassed at 200 °C. Rh dispersion was determined by H2 adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 chemisorption analyzer at 35 °C in the pressure range of 0.0001 to 0.5 MPa. For these experiments, the catalysts were reduced in-situ at 300 °C under hydrogen flow for 2 h. Then, the samples were evacuated at the reduction temperature for 30 min and cooled to 35 °C. At this temperature, the catalysts were further evacuated for 2 h followed by analysis. Rh dispersion was determined using the dual isotherm method to estimate total and reversible chemisorption uptakes. The H/Rh molar ratio was assumed as equal to 1.5 [22]. Particle size distribution and average particle size was determined by transmission electron microscopy in a JEM 2010 F analytical microscope equipped with HAADF detector. At least 150 particles were measured to obtain the mean particle size < ds > defined as, d s = Σ n i d i 3 / Σ n i d i 2 , n i corresponding to the number of particles with a diameter d i . The reduction properties of the catalysts were studied by temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (TPR-H2) using an ISRI RIG-100 unit. The calcined sample was reduced using a 5%H2/N2 gas mixture flow (30 mL/min) and a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 600 °C. The H2O produced by the reduction was removed before arriving the TCD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific Spectrometer Escalab XI 250, equipped with an aluminum anode (1486.8 eV) and monochromator system X-ray analyzer coupled with a power step 25 eV and a step size of 0.05 eV. The pressure in the analysis chamber was 6.3 × 10−9 MPa. To correct the charging effect of the sample in the X-ray spectrum, all binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s line at 284.6 eV. The XPS spectra were analyzed using Avantage software. The nature of the acid sites was studied by pyridine adsorption followed by FTIR (Pyr-FTIR). Infrared spectra were collected using a Nicolet Thermo iS50 equipment and in-situ adsorption of pyridine was carried out in a diffuse reflectance cell (Harrick, Praying Mantis). The samples were reduced at 300 °C under hydrogen flow (50 mL/min) for 1 h and then gradually cooled down to 50 °C in helium flow (30 mL/min). A reference spectrum of the solid was collected. Then pyridine adsorption took place for 1 h. After adsorption, pyridine was gradually removed by evacuation with an helium flow (30 mL/min) at 373 °C and the spectrum was recorded. Spectra were collected from 120 scans with a resolution of 2 cm−1. 2.4 Catalytic experiments The catalytic hydrogenation of m-DNB (Fig. 1 ) in liquid phase was carried out in a batch type reactor at 50 °C and a pressure of H2 of 200 psi. The catalyst was reduced ex-situ at 300 °C in H2 flow (30 mL/min) and loaded carefully in the reactor already containing 40 mL of m-DNB solution in ethanol 0.02 M purged with helium. The reactor was then sealed and H2 was loaded to the desired pressure. Typically, 0.2 g of catalyst was used, and the reaction was monitored for 3 h. The reaction progress was followed by gas chromatography in a Varian 3800 equipment using a RTX-5 column working with the following heating program: 80 °C for 1 min, then 10 °C/min up to 300 °C and finally hold time of 3 min. The CG injector and FID detector temperatures were 250 and 300 °C, respectively. Under these conditions the elution time was 15.8 min, 16.6 min and 13.5 min for m-DNB, m-NA and m-PDA, respectively. 3 Results and discussion Table 1 displays results about the Rh content as determined by EDS, the dispersion (D) expressed as H/Rh molar ratio as obtained from H2-chemisorption isotherms and the mean particle size (ds) obtained by TEM. As observed the nominal Rh loading (1 wt%) was obtained in catalysts supported on TiO2 and Al2O3, while a slightly lower content (0.8 wt%) was observed in the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst. This difference could be related to sampling for collecting the EDS spectra. As pH of the impregnating solution is close to the PZC of ZrO2 (pH = 5) it is expected a better interaction of the precursor with the surface of TiO2 and Al2O3 than with ZrO2. Heterogeneity of the resulting distribution is also confirmed by TEM. Regarding metal dispersion determined by H2-chemisorption, Rh/ZrO2 shows the lowest one which results in the highest particle size value as confirmed by TEM measurements. A very good agreement between results of particle size obtained by TEM and Hydrogen chemisorption is observed for Rh/ZrO2 and Rh/Al2O3 samples. Fig. 2 shows typical TEM images and the corresponding particle size distribution histograms of Rh catalysts reduced at 300 °C. The particle size histogram of Rh/ZrO2 shows a broader distribution compared to that of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/TiO2, which is in line with the above. For Rh/TiO2 it is important to note that the average particle size is 1.2 nm, about half the one obtained by H2 chemisorption (Table 1). This result suggests that a partial coverage of the Rh particles by TiOx species (SMSI effect) could be affecting the Hydrogen chemisorption and finally the dispersion values [4]. It is interesting to note that the available surface area of the support (Table 1), correlates well with the resulting particle size of Rh in the case of Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/ZrO2, i.e. a higher available surface area leads in principle to a lower metal particle size, however, when comparing Rh/TiO2 sample, which support presents the lowest surface area, particle size of Rh is smaller. Thus, interaction of the metal precursor with the titania surface results in a more homogeneous particle size distribution. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H2) of calcined rhodium catalysts is presented in Fig. 3 . For all catalysts, reduction of Rh2O3 is evidenced by a much or less broad peak at a temperature around 50 °C. This signal is attributed to the reduction of well dispersed Rh2O3 particles [22,23]. In the case of Rh/ZrO2, a broader reduction peak was observed along with an uptake beyond 100 °C which probably corresponds to reduction of larger Rh2O3 particles present in the sample as was revealed by TEM results. Quantitative analysis of the hydrogen consumption showed in the case of Rh/TiO2 sample, a reduction higher than 100%. This may be linked to a partial reduction of the support (TiO2-x species with x < 2). For Rh/ZrO2 a 100% reduction of Rh was observed while for Rh/Al2O3 only 79% reduction of the metal was attained. To determine the oxidation state of Rh and the relative amount of the Rh species at the surface of the catalysts reduced at 300 °C, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used. Fig. 4 displays the XPS spectra collected in the region of Rh 3d core levels characterized by the two spin orbit components doublet, Rh 3d5/2 and Rh 3d3/2. For Rh/TiO2 and Rh/Al2O3 catalysts, Rh 3d5/2 peak can be decomposed in two components, the first one in the range 306.5–307 eV and the second one in the range 308.5–309 eV [24]. The first component is attributable to metallic rhodium (Rh°), while the second one is attributable to positively charged rhodium species; Rh3+ (Rh2O3) for Rh/Al2O3 [24,25] or Rhδ+ in the case of Rh/TiO2 [25]. In the case of Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, only the component at 307 eV is observed, which is attributed to Rh° species [26]. Complete reduction of Rh is in agreement with TPR results. While for Rh/Al2O3, the presence of oxidized species (30% of Rh3+) indicating incomplete reduction of Rh2O3, is also in line with the TPR results, the occurrence of a non-negligible amount of oxidized species (20% of Rh3+) in Rh/TiO2 sample apparently is not. Reduction peak in TPR profile of Rh/TiO2 catalyst may be associated to both, reduction of Rh and the titania support. To prove this, the Ti 2p3/2 core level was decomposed (Fig. 4d) showing peaks at 457.2 and 459 eV assigned to Ti4+ and Ti3+ species, respectively. The signal of Ti3+ has been reported by other authors to confirm the SMSI effect [18–20]. The nature of the acid sites on the surface of the catalysts was determined by Pyr-FTIR analysis (Fig. 5 ). All catalyst, showed bands related to Lewis acid sites and the position of the signals depends of the oxide used as support. As it is observed for Rh/ZrO2, the bands at 1444 cm−1 and 1606 cm−1 were also reported by Hertl [27]. In Rh/Al2O3 sample, the bands appear at 1450 cm−1 and 1616 cm−1 [28]. However, for this catalyst a band at 1592 cm−1 indicates that physisorbed pyridine was not removed completely. On the other hand, Rh/TiO2 showed four bands (1444, 1490, 1575 and, 1606 cm−1), which are well established for Lewis acid sites in anatase TiO2 [29]. The order of surface acidity of the catalysts established using the intensity of the peaks is the following; Rh/ZrO2 < Rh/Al2O3 < Rh/TiO2. 3.1 Catalytic activity Fig. 6 shows the evolution of reactant and products as a function of reaction time for each catalyst. All samples exhibited similar results. Hydrogenation of m-DNB to m-PDA is a consecutive reaction, where the hydrogenation of one of the two nitro groups leads to m-NA which subsequently hydrogenates to m-PDA. In all catalysts, m-DNB is consumed before 3 h reaction. m-phenylhydroxylamine (m-HA) formation as a byproduct was not observed, indicating the conditions of H2-pressure are sufficient to inhibit the coupling of m-PDA on the surface of the catalyst [30]. To evaluate the catalytic activity in the overall reaction, kinetic constant (k) was calculated for both hydrogenation steps, first m-DNB to m-NA (k 1) and second, m-NA to m-PDA (k 2), assuming these steps to be consecutive and obeying a pseudo-first order kinetics, as follows: The equations representing the concentration of the three components as a function of time, are: (1) -d[m-DNB]/dt = k 1[m-DNB] (2) d[m-NA]/dt= k 1[m-DNB] - k 2[m-NA] (3) d[m-PDA]/dt = k 2[m-NA] Integration of the above equations results in the following: (4) [ m D N B ] = [ m D N B ] 0 e - k 1 t (5) m N A = k 1 m D N B 0 k 2 - k 1 e - k 1 t - e - k 2 t (6) m P D A = m D N B 0 1 + k 1 k 2 - k 1 e - k 1 t + k 1 k 2 - k 1 e - k 2 t The value of k 1 can be calculated from the plot -Ln[m-DNB]/[m-DNB]0 versus reaction time at low conversion. Fig. 7 depicts the consumption of m-DNB (-Ln (CA/CA0)) versus reaction time (t) for each of the catalysts. The slope of this straight line represents the reaction rate constant (k1 ). The second reaction rate constant (k 2) cannot be calculated directly, but the highest mole fraction reached by m-NA is represented by the maximum concentration obtained from Eq. (8): (7) t(max) = ln(k1/k2)/(k1 – k2) (8) [m-NA]max = [m-DNB]0 (k1/k2)(k 2/ k 2 – k 1 ) Since k 1 constant is known, then from [m-NA]max and tmax, the value of the k2 constant can be calculated. Table 2 summarizes the values of k 1 and k 2 constants, the former being higher than the latter. k 1 value for the transformation of m-DNB to m-NA, follows the order: Rh/Al2O3 > Rh/TiO2 > Rh/ZrO2 and this trend is not preserved for the reaction of m-NA to m-PDA. However, as the values of k 2 show, the hydrogenation rate of the second nitro-group is much slower than the reduction of the first one for Rh/Al2O3 and in lesser extent for Rh/ZrO2. To explain the results showed in Table 2, several results should be taken into account: i) Rh° is only present at the surface of Rh/ZrO2, ii) a mixture of Rh° and Rh electron deficient sites is present at the surface of Rh/TiO2 and Rh/Al2O3, iii) Occurrence of electron deficient sites (Rhn+) is higher in Rh/Al2O3. m-DNB adsorbs preferentially on electron deficient sites due to the electronegativity of the –NO2 groups, and these sites are provided by Rh3+ species on the surface of the catalysts supported on alumina and titania. The activation of nitro groups occurs indistinctly due to symmetry plane of m-DNB. In the literature, the selectivity to m-NA is attributed generally to the high adsorption strength of the nitro group [31]. An excess of Rh° species favors the formation of m-PDA. Thus, a stronger adsorption of m-DNB on the surface of the catalyst could be responsible for the high and low values of, respectively, k 1 and k 2, i.e. a preferential hydrogenation of m-DNB to m-NA in the catalytic system. In the first step of the reaction the activation of NO2 groups of m-DNB is necessary, thus, it should follow the order: Rh/Al2O3 > Rh/TiO2 > Rh/ZrO2, but then Rh° is necessary to m-PDA formation. To prove this, the k2/k1 ratio linked to formation of m-PDA was correlated with Rh° species determined by XPS (Fig. 8 ). As observed a direct correlation of k 2/k 1 ratio with the amount of Rh° is obtained and, as expected, selectivity to m-NA increases as the occurrence of metallic Rh increases. On the other hand, correlation of k 2/k 1 ratio with particle size or surface acidity was not observed. 4 Conclusion Rh supported on Al2O3, ZrO2 and TiO2 was studied as catalyst for liquid phase hydrogenation of m-DNB. The nature of the surface metal sites in Rh catalysts depends on the support linked this with the reduction degree of the metallic phase. The landscape of active sites at the surface (Rh° and Rhn+) modifies the selectivity obtained in the hydrogenation of m-DNB. An adequate ratio of Rh°/Rhn+ species controls hydrogenation rate of m-DNB to m-NA reaction (partial hydrogenation) and of the subsequent m-NA to m-PDA reaction. A stronger adsorption of m-DNB to activate the nitro group on electron deficient Rh sites seems to be responsible for the preferential hydrogenation of m-DNB to m-NA, which correlates well with the kinetic results showing the following order for kinetic constant k1 (m-DNB to m-NA): Rh/Al2O3 > Rh/TiO2 > Rh/ZrO2. On the other hand, the presence of Rh° is necessary to m-PDA formation as evidenced by the linear correlation of the kinetic rate constants ratio (k1/k2) with the amount of Rh° at the surface of the catalyst. A correlation of acidity of the catalysts and the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of m-dinitrobenzene (m-DNB) was not found.
