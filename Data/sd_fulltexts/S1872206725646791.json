Herein, we report P- and S- doped Ni single-atom catalysts, i.e. symmetric Ni1/PN4 and asymmetric Ni1/SN3C can exhibit high catalytic activity of CO2 reduction with stable potential windows. It is revealed that the key intermediate *COOH in CO2 electroreduction is stabilized by heteroatom doping, which stems from the upward shift of the axial dz 2 orbital of the active metal Ni atom. Furthermore, we investigate the potential-dependent free energetics and dynamic properties at the electrochemical interface on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with a full explicit solvent model. Based on the potential-dependent microkinetic model, we predict that S-atom doped Ni SAC shifts the onset potential of CO2 electroreduction from –0.88 to –0.80 V vs. RHE, exhibiting better activity. Overall, this work provides an in-depth understanding of structure-activity relationships and atomic-level electrochemical interfaces of catalytic systems, and offers insights into the rational design of heteroatom-doped catalysts for targeted catalysis. Graphical Abstract The coordination environment of Ni single-atom catalysts was regulated by heteroatom doping, which reduced the electron filling of the (dz 2-π*)* antibonding orbitals, stabilized the key intermediate *COOH for CO2 electroreduction, and promoted the electrocatalytic activity. Keywords Ni single-atom catalyst Heteroatom doping CO2 electroreduction Ab initio molecular dynamics 1 Introduction Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is considered as a promising approach to alleviate environmental issues and energy crisis [ 1–5 ], hence, developing efficient eCO2RR catalysts is particularly imperative. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated metal atoms dispersed on supports frequently exhibit unexpected catalytic activity owing to their unique central metal chemical environment and tunable active site electronic properties [ 6–8 ]. Currently, numerous studies on SACs, especially supported on nitrogen-doped carbon materials, have been performed for CO2 electroreduction [ 9–12 ]. For instance, Gu et al. [ 13 ] anchored iron atoms in pyrrole nitrogen-doped carbon supports, and the dispersed single-atom Fe sites can efficiently catalyze the electroreduction of CO2 to CO at an overpotential as low as 80 mV, and partial current density reaches 94 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 340 mV. The superior catalytic performances are attributed to the Fe active sites maintaining the +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, which provides faster CO2 adsorption and weaker CO adsorption compared to the conventional Fe2+ sites. Wang et al. [ 14 ] designed a series of Co-N x (x = 2, 3, 4) SACs with different numbers of nitrogen coordination sites for CO2 electroreduction. Among them, the Co-N2 catalyst presents the highest activity with a current density of 18.1 mA/cm2 at –0.63 V vs. RHE, which was about 7.3 and 23.3 times higher than that of CoN3 and CoN4 catalysts. The Co sites with low N coordination numbers allow electrons to be transferred more quickly from the catalyst surface to the reactant, facilitating the conversion of CO2 molecules into adsorbed CO2 – intermediates on the metal centers. This work illustrates the importance of regulating the coordination environment in the design of high-performance CO2 electroreduction catalysts. The performance of relevant 3d metal SACs with M-N-C structures for eCO2RR to CO is summarized in Table S1. By comparison, Ni SACs have attracted more interest due to their excellent catalytic activity and selectivity. Ju et al. [ 15 ] explored the catalytic performance of different transition metals M-N-C (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) SACs. Thereinto, the Ni-N-C catalyst displays a maximum CO faradaic efficiency of 85% at –0.78 V vs. RHE, which is significantly higher than the other transition metal catalysts. Notably, the outstanding activity of Ni-N-C catalyst at the potential below –0.75 V vs. RHE is comparable to that of Au- and Ag-based catalysts. Similarly, Hu et al. [ 16 ] discovered that the selectivity of TM-N-C catalysts to CO is generally ordered by Ni > Fe » Co, and the activity follows Ni, Fe » Co. Surprisingly, Li et al. [ 17 ] constructed exclusive Ni-N4 sites through a topo-chemical transformation strategy, achieving high Faradaic efficiency over 90% for CO in the potential range from –0.5 to –0.9 V and giving a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 99% at –0.81 V vs. RHE with a current density of 28.6 mA/cm2. Different from other TM-N-C structures, Ni-N-C structure due to the chemical inertness of the active site, i.e., dz 2 orbital is occupied by two electrons, usually exhibits excellent activity and selectivity of eCO2RR to CO only at relatively higher overpotentials [ 18 ]. Nevertheless, it was experimentally demonstrated that rationally tuning the electronic structure of the active center could promote the electrocatalytic performance, and regulating the local coordination environment by heteroatoms doping was considered a powerful strategy [ 19–21 ]. Chen et al. [ 22 ] fabricated the Fe1-NSC SAC with sulfur doping in the second shell layer of the FeN4 structure, and disclosed that sulfur doping induces an obvious proton-feeding effect by accelerating the hydrolysis dissociation, which reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *COOH and thus improves the eCO2RR performance. Pei et al. [ 23 ] synthesized a series of Co-S x N4–x (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) SACs by thermally replacing coordinated N with S, and revealed a volcano relationship between the number of S-atom coordination and the eCO2RR performance. The Co-S1N3 catalyst is located at the apex of the volcano, benefiting from the asymmetric site that can well balance the binding energies of COOH* and CO* intermediates. In addition, Yang et al. [ 24 ] reported an A-Ni-NSG SAC with the monovalent Ni(I) atomic center in the d 9 electronic configuration prepared by adding a sulfur precursor. The A-Ni-NSG catalyst exhibits extremely high intrinsic CO2 reduction activity, reaching a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 97% and high turnover frequency of 14800 h–1 at a mild overpotential of 0.61 V, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than TOFs of cobalt protoporphyrin and noble metal catalysts. This experimental evidence intuitively revealed that heteroatom modification has a crucial effect on catalytic performance. Although there have been some experimental reports on the introduction of heteroatom modification on N-doped graphene supports, the exact site of introduced heteroatom is elusive and controversial, which makes some experimental and theoretical results contradictory [ 24,25 ]. Besides, the calculation method based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model ignores solvation effects as well as the role of hydrogen bonding networks, and does not consider the kinetics of the reaction [ 26–29 ]. Herein, we tuned the electronic structure of the Ni1/N4C catalyst by using P or S modification through theoretical insights to improve the performance of eCO2RR. A combination of costly constrained molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations and thermodynamic integral (TI) was used to investigate the potential-dependent free energy profile of the screened heteroatom-doped Ni SAC with the full explicit solvent model. A potential-dependent hydrogen bond network-assisted hydrogenation reaction mechanism was revealed. In addition, we attempted to estimate the reaction rate of the heteroatom-doped Ni SAC by employing microkinetic simulations and compared it with the Ni1/N4C catalyst. 2 Computational methods All static calculations are implemented using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [ 30,31 ]. The exchange correlation potential was treated with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [ 32 ]. The valence electrons were described by a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the CP2K/Quickstep package [ 33 ]. The electronic structure calculations were described by DFT with the spin-polarized PBE functional and mixed double-ζ Gaussian and plane-wave (GPW) basis sets [ 34 ]. The cut-off of 400 Rydberg was used to define the planewave cut-off for the finest level of the multi-grid, and the cut-off for the grid to map Gaussians in real space (relative cut-off energy) was set to 60 Rydberg. The core electrons are represented by the Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials [ 35 ]. The van der Waals interactions were considered using the DFT-D3 correction method in all the calculations [ 36 ]. The system temperature was set to 300 K by the canonical ensemble (NVT) employing Nose-Hoover thermostats [ 37,38 ]. The atomic mass of all hydrogen atoms was set to 2.0 with the time step of 1 fs. The AIMD simulation model with full explicit water solvent is shown in Fig. S1, and the collective variables used as reaction coordinates in the constrained MD method are shown in Fig. S2. More computation details can be found in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Heteroatom doped Ni SAC The doping mode of heteroatom directly affects the electronic structure of the catalyst and, thus, the catalytic performance. In this work, the introduced heteroatom such as P and S, is considered to replace two atoms in the N-doped graphene since the atomic radii of the P (1.10 Å) and S (1.03 Å) atoms are significantly larger than those of the C (0.77 Å) and N (0.74 Å) atoms, and this type of doping has also been reported experimentally [ 23 ]. There are three different substitution sites within the first shell layer of the central metal Ni atom as shown in Fig. 1(a) . Accordingly, we calculated the formation energies of these three doping configurations for P (Fig. 1(b)) and S (Fig. 1(c)) atoms respectively. The results show that the symmetric Ni1/PN4 structure formed by the P atom replacing two C atoms is the most stable, while the S atom prefers to substitute one N atom and one five-membered ring C atom to form the asymmetric Ni1/SN3C structure. We are more concerned about the stability of the catalyst under operative conditions, especially the effect of the reaction electrode potential and the pH of the solvent environment. Therefore, we employed the Pourbaix diagram derived by constructing a thermodynamic cycle to evaluate the state of catalysts and considered the formation of possible adsorbates involving aqueous solvent dissociation at the metal site, including *H and *OH intermediates [ 39 ]. The calculation details of the Pourbaix diagram are attached in Supplementary Information. For the Ni1/PN4 catalyst, it can maintain a clean state within a wide potential window and pH range as demonstrated in Fig. 1(d). The metal sites of the Ni1/PN4 catalyst are expected to be covered by *H species at electrode potentials below –1.66 V (at pH = 7) and by *OH species at electrode potentials above +0.74 V (at pH = 7). Besides, the Ni atoms can leach out from the Ni1/PN4 catalyst to form the free Ni2+ ions or Ni(OH)2 precipitates when the oxidation potential is higher than +1.34 V. Similarly, for the Ni1/SN3C catalyst (Fig. 1(e)), it also has a suitable electrochemical operating window. Only when the applied potential is below –1.37 V (at pH = 7), the active sites of the catalyst favor the adsorption of *H species. Moreover, Ni atoms do not leach out from the Ni1/SN3C catalyst until applied potentials is higher than +0.28 V. However, the applied potential for electrochemical CO2 reduction is the reduction potential and it is mainly performed under alkaline conditions experimentally, thus, both Ni1/PN4 and Ni1/SN3C catalysts are sufficiently stable under operative conditions. Since CO2 adsorption on the Ni-N4C catalyst can occur prior to the onset potential [ 40 ], and proton transfer to form *COOH is experimentally and theoretically considered to be the rate-determining step in the CO2 electroreduction [ 17,40–42 ], we analyze the electronic structure of the key intermediate, *COOH, on the catalyst. When the intermediate *COOH is adsorbed on the TM1/N4C catalyst, the dominant interactions occur in the frontier orbitals between the axial dz 2 orbital of Ni atom and the π* orbital of *COOH intermediate, which results in a bonding (dz 2-π*) orbital and an antibonding (dz 2-π*)* orbital. Different from the dz 2 orbital of the d 6 metal Fe atom (Fig. S3), which is occupied with only one electron, the dz2 orbital of the d 8 metal Ni atom is fully filled with two electrons, therefore, not only is the bonding (dz 2-π*) orbital filled with electrons, but the antibonding (dz2 -π*)* orbital is also partially occupied, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b) . This well explains that the electron-coupled proton transfer to form *COOH intermediate on the Ni1/N4C catalyst is difficult, so that the catalyst is active only at high overpotential. For the symmetric Ni1/PN4 catalyst, the P atom is coordinated with the N atom rather than directly with the metal Ni atom. It can be seen that the d orbitals of the Ni atom are shifted upwards as a whole after P-atom doping, where the energy level of the dz 2 orbital rises from –1.20 to –1.04 eV (Fig. S4). While for the asymmetric Ni1/SN3C catalyst, the S atom is directly coordinated with the Ni atom, rendering the coordination field of the metal Ni center to change significantly. The dz 2 orbital of the Ni atom is split, with the corresponding energy levels of –0.97 and –1.21 eV. Importantly, the electronegativity of the S atom (2.58) is less than that of the N atom (3.04), allowing the Ni atom of the Ni1/SN3C catalyst to exhibit stronger metallicity. We refer the valence states of Ni SACs to NiO bulk with divalent Ni2+, as shown in Table S2. As expected, P-atom doping does not change the valence state of Ni atom, while Ni atom is partially reduced after S-atom doping, showing a lower oxidation state. It is worth noting that the Ni atoms of Ni SACs are not bivalent cations, but Ni σ+ (1 < σ < 2) cations, which are even closer to being monovalent. This is consistent with the characterization results reported in the experiment [ 24 ]. The inherent variation of electronic structure has a great impact on its chemical properties, and the density of states (DOS) and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) [ 43,44 ] clearly present the effect induced by heteroatom doping, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Due to the upward shift of the dz 2 orbitals of Ni atoms, the bonding (dz 2-π*) and antibonding (dz 2-π*)* orbitals of the interactions also rise, resulting in more antibonding (dz 2-π*) orbital components being located above the Fermi energy level. The integral COHP (ICOHP) of the Ni-C pair is shifted negatively to –1.91 eV for P-atom doping and –2.01 eV for S-atom doping from the original –1.66 eV. As a result, the adsorption of the intermediate *COOH is enhanced by heteroatom doping. Owing to the lower oxidation state for the active center of the asymmetric Ni1/SN3C catalyst, relatively more electrons are available for the adsorbed *COOH, as shown in Fig. S5. In addition, we calculated the performances of CO2 electroreduction on Ni SACs based on CHE method (Fig. 2(e)). The adsorption free energies of the key intermediate *COOH on heteroatom-doped Ni SACs decrease remarkably, especially from 1.33 to 0.78 eV for the S-doped catalyst, suggesting that its catalytic activity was improved. In contrast, the catalyst with S atom replacing only one coordinate N atom, which is the model speculated by some experiments [ 24 ], has no significant change in the adsorption of *COOH (from 1.33 to 1.30 eV) and *CO (from 0.75 to 0.72 eV) intermediates (Fig. S6). Consequently, it can been preliminarily demonstrated that the heteroatom-doped Ni SACs present better performance for CO2 electroreduction. 3.2 Free energy profiles of CO2RR To explore CO2 electroreduction at the electrochemical interface in realistic reaction environments, we adopted a fully explicit solvent model for the Ni1/SN3C catalyst to further investigate the effect of electrode potentials. Firstly, the free energy profiles of CO2 adsorption at different applied potentials are constructed, as shown in Fig. 3(a) . And the statistical mean forces of constrained MD simulations for the CO2 adsorption are shown in Fig. S7. It can be seen that the free energy of CO2 adsorption is significantly dependent on the applied potential, with the reaction switching from endothermic to exothermic when the applied potential shifts to more negative; meanwhile, the free energy barrier is also decreased. As the applied potential is –0.72 V vs. RHE, the adsorption free energy and the barrier are close, 0.30 and 0.31 eV, respectively, indicating that the CO2 adsorption is thermodynamically not favorable at this potential. When the applied potential drops to –1.12 V vs. RHE, the adsorption free energy and barrier decrease to –0.39 and 0.09 eV, respectively, suggesting that CO2 can be spontaneously and stably adsorbed on the active site. In addition, the adsorption behavior of CO2 on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst at different applied potentials was analyzed. When the applied potential shifts from –0.72 to –1.12 V vs. RHE, the position of the transition state is gradually elongated from the Ni-C bond length of 2.20 to 2.40 Å and then to 2.70 Å, indicating that the position of the transition state is approaching to the initial state from near the final state, thus, that a lower potential can start the activation of CO2 from a longer distance. Similarly, the net Bader charge of adsorbed CO2 also progressively increased from –0.53 to –0.83 and then to –1.10|e| (Fig. 3(b)), which illustrates that it is not essential to transfer a full electron in the first electron transfer step, and that perhaps a partial charge is transferred in the subsequent proton transfer step. On the contrary, the net Bader charge of the metal Ni atom is almost unchanged, remaining at around +0.76|e|, which is consistent with our previous results [ 45,46 ]. This reveals that the Ni atom in the active center is merely an electron transferor, diverting electrons from the graphite electrode to the CO2 molecule. To better understand the process of CO2 adsorption and activation, we further statistically analyze the final 2 ps AIMD trajectories. Fig. 3(c) displays the fluctuation of the O–C–O bond angle of the adsorbed CO2 molecule at different applied potentials. It can be observed that the lower the applied potential, the more bend of the adsorbed CO2 is, with trajectory-averaged O–C–O bond angles of 139.5°, 130.8°, and 121.3°, respectively. The net charge variation and bond angle variation of the adsorbed CO2 manifest the gradual evolution of the CO2 molecule from partial reduction to complete reduction at different applied potentials. Moreover, since CO2 adsorption is a remarkable electron transfer step, the polar aqueous solvent surrounding it is inclined to form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms in the adsorbed CO2. Consequently, the effect of the aqueous solvent environment on the system at different applied potentials was also tracked. Here, the geometrical criterion for determining the formation of hydrogen bonds consists of two parts, which are the distance between the H atoms in surrounding water molecules and the O atoms in *CO2 is less than 2.2 Å and the bond angle of ∠O–O–H formed between the O atoms in *CO2 and the O–H bonds in water molecules is less than 20°. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the number of hydrogen bonds is strongly driven by the applied potential, which stems from the different degrees of polarization of adsorbed CO2 at different applied potentials. The statistical average number of hydrogen bonds is 1.67, 2.84, and 4.36, respectively, as the applied potential shifts to more negative. It is worth noting that more hydrogen bonds are likely to facilitate subsequent proton transfer since the hydrogen protons in the proton transfer step are derived from water molecules under neutral or alkaline conditions. Having analyzed the electron transfer step of CO2 adsorption, we further investigated the protonation of the adsorbed CO2 to form the *COOH intermediate, as shown in Fig. 4(a) . Given that the proton transfer step involves both the breaking and generation of chemical bonds, here we defined a combined collective variable (Fig. S2). Besides, the statistical mean forces of constrained MD simulations for the *COOH formation are given in Fig. S8. With the applied potential shifting from –0.76 to –0.93 V vs. RHE, the protonation process is consistently endothermic, and the reaction free energy decreases from 0.34 to 0.18 eV; meanwhile, the free energy barrier decreases from 0.41 to 0.29 eV. Compared to CO2 adsorption, the protonation process is thermodynamically and kinetically more difficult. Nevertheless, the conversion of adsorbed CO2 to *COOH intermediate on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst is relatively more facile than the Ni1/N4C catalyst from our previous work [ 46 ]. Interestingly, the net Bader charges of the *COOH intermediate are –0.43 and –0.58 |e|, respectively, rather than being approximately electrically neutral (Fig. 4(b)), suggesting that the proton transfer process is coupled with partial electron transfer. In general, the rate-determining step for the electroreduction of CO2 is either the electron transfer step [ 45,47 ], the proton transfer step [ 41,46 ], or the proton-coupled electron transfer step [ 40,48 ], which are all included in the first electron-proton transfer step, and thus the first electron-proton transfer step (* + CO2 + H2O + e– → *COOH + OH–) is usually deemed as the rate-determining step for eCO2RR to CO, which has been analyzed by decoupling here. To confirm the view, the free energy profile of *COOH intermediate splitting to produce adsorbed *CO was explored (Fig. 4(c)). And the corresponding mean forces for the constrained MD simulations are shown in Fig. S9. It can be seen that the process of *CO formation is a remarkable exothermic reaction, which is thermodynamically favorable. Besides, the kinetic energy barrier of the reaction is also lower than that of the first proton transfer process. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the first electron-proton transfer step, specifically the proton transfer step, as a rate-determining step. Similarly, the net Bader charge of adsorbed *CO is dependent on the applied potential. More electrons are transferred from the graphite electrode to the adsorbate at low potentials. Whereas the net Bader charge of the metal Ni atom remains constant (Fig. 4(d)). We achieved the free energy profiles and dynamic properties of CO2 electroreduction at different applied potentials on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst by cMD simulations and thermodynamic integrals under the full explicit solvent model, which could not be obtained under the simple gas-phase or implicit solvent models. This is essential for us to accurately understand and describe the CO2 electroreduction process. Furthermore, the dependence of the reaction free energy and kinetic energy barrier on the electrode potential will be discussed in detail in the later section. 3.3 Potential-dependent kinetics for CO2RR To intuitively manifest the effect of S-atom doping on the performance of eCO2RR, we compared the Ni1/SN3C catalyst with the Ni1/N4C catalyst from our previous work [ 46 ]. Here we discuss only the first proton-electron transfer step, which is considered to contain the rate-determining step in the whole reaction. The reaction free energy diagrams of CO2RR on Ni1/N4C and Ni1/SN3C catalysts are shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b) , consisting of steps with similar electrode potentials. S-atom doping has little effect on the CO2 adsorption process, which is mainly dependent on the electrode potential of the reaction. However, the subsequent hydrogenation of adsorbed CO2 to *COOH intermediate, which is the dominant factor in the reaction rate, is significantly facilitated kinetically and thermodynamically by S-atom doping. Notably, the kinetic energy barrier of the proton transfer step on both Ni SACs is slightly higher than the reaction free energy by about 0.1 eV, suggesting a dependence between the energy barrier and the free energy. Therefore, it is feasible to employ the binding energy of the key intermediate *COOH and the metal site to evaluate the doping of heteroatoms, as mentioned above. In a word, S-atom doped Ni single-atom catalyst improves the catalytic activity of CO2RR by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate. We have further analyzed the electronic structure of catalysts with adsorbed intermediates. COHP calculations (Fig. 5(c)) revealed that the (dz 2-π*)* orbitals formed in the frontier orbitals after CO2 adsorption on Ni1/N4C and Ni1/SN3C catalysts are almost both located above the Fermi level at a potential of about –0.72 V vs. RHE, and thus the electrons fall back into the catalysts. As mentioned above, the Bader charge of adsorbed CO2 is only –0.53 |e| at this potential. Therefore, the effect of S doping on the adsorption free energy of CO2 is insignificant. When the adsorbed CO2 obtains one negative charge (at –1.12 V vs. RHE), the adsorption free energy of CO2 on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst is –0.39 eV, which is lower than that of –0.25 eV on the Ni1/N4C catalyst [ 46 ]. In contrast, for the adsorbed intermediate *COOH, the electrons have been completely transferred, and the (dz 2-π*)* orbital is also partially filled with electrons. Nevertheless, S-atom doping resulted in a higher position of the antibonding orbitals and relatively fewer electrons being filled. Bader charge (Table S3) and DOS calculations (Fig. S10) showed that the numbers of electrons in the dz 2 orbitals and the *COOH intermediates on Ni1/SN3C catalysts were both less than those on Ni1/N4C catalysts. On the other hand, selectivity is also not negligible when discussing CO2RR performance. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the major competitive reaction for CO2RR in aqueous solvent [ 3,49 ]. We thus explored the free energy profiles of the Volmer reaction (* + H2O + e– → *H + OH–) in HER on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst under alkaline conditions (Fig. S11). We noted that the free energy barrier of the Volmer reaction is above 1.30 eV when the electrode potential is –0.75 V vs. RHE, and even when the electrode potential drops to –1.22 V vs. RHE, the free energy barrier exceeds 0.85 eV, which is dramatically higher than that of the CO2 adsorption process. Therefore, it can be concluded that CO2RR is significantly more favorable than HER on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst, which agrees with the results of the high selectivity of Ni SACs in most experiments [ 17,50–52 ]. It should be noted that the continuation of cMD simulations along the reaction coordinate at an electrode potential of –1.22 V is accompanied by the occurrence of the Heyrovsky reaction to produce H2, so we cut off the reaction coordinate for qualitative analysis here. In addition, we investigated and compared the reaction rates of CO2 electroreduction on Ni1/SN3C and Ni1/N4C catalysts by employing the potential-dependent microkinetic model. The relationship between the reaction free energy (ΔG) and the energy barrier (ΔG ≠) with the electrode potential (U) was fitted as shown in Fig. S12. Therein, the slope denotes the magnitude of the thermodynamic and kinetic dependence on the electrode potential, which is mainly contributed by charge transfer and solvation effects. Based on the fitted linear relationship, we can obtain the reaction free energies at continuous different potentials. Next, a microkinetic model is developed to derive the partial current density of CO as a function of the applied potential. Computational details of the microkinetic model are given in the Supporting Information. Experimentally, the applied potential corresponding to the current density reaching 10 mA/cm2 is defined as the onset potential of CO2RR [ 53 ]. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the predicted onset potential of the Ni1/N4C catalyst is –0.88 V vs. RHE. Encouragingly, the Ni1/SN3C catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity than the Ni1/N4C catalyst, with a predicted onset potential of –0.80 V vs. RHE. As a result, the potential-dependent microkinetic quantitatively demonstrated the effect of S-atom doping on CO2 electroreduction, which inspires us to believe that the catalytic activity can be effectively improved by precise manipulation of heteroatom doping. 4 Conclusions In view of the excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance on the Ni SAC only under the condition of high overpotential, we proposed a strategy of heteroatom P and S doping and screened out Ni1/PN4 and Ni1/SN3C catalysts with thermodynamic stability under operative conditions. By regulating the axial dz 2 orbital location of the active center Ni atom, the formed antibonding (dz 2-π*)* orbital is shifted upward, which in turn stabilizes the key intermediate *COOH in CO2 electroreduction. Furthermore, the free energy profiles of CO2 electroreduction on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst at different potentials were investigated by using a full explicit solvent model. We decoupled the first electron-proton transfer step for detailed analysis, in which the proton transfer step is regarded as the rate-determining step of the whole reaction. The potential-dependent H–bond network assisted hydrogenation reaction mechanism was revealed. The potential-dependent microkinetic model was implemented to estimate the CO2 electroreduction reaction rate, and the predicted onset potentials of Ni1/N4C and Ni1/SN3C catalysts were –0.88 and –0.80 V vs. RHE, respectively, demonstrating better activity after S-atom doping. In summary, we elucidated the regulatory effect of heteroatom doping on the electronic structure of the metal active center and explored the free energetics and dynamic properties at the electrochemical interface, which provides insights for the design of high-performance catalysts oriented to multiple electrocatalytic reactions.

        "dc:description": "The Ni single-atom catalyst dispersed on nitrogen doped graphene support has attracted much interest due to the high selectivity in electro-catalyzing CO2 reduction to CO, yet the chemical inertness of the metal center renders it to exhibit electrochemical activity only under high overpotentials. Herein, we report P- and S- doped Ni single-atom catalysts, i.e. symmetric Ni1/PN4 and asymmetric Ni1/SN3C can exhibit high catalytic activity of CO2 reduction with stable potential windows. It is revealed that the key intermediate *COOH in CO2 electroreduction is stabilized by heteroatom doping, which stems from the upward shift of the axial dz 2 orbital of the active metal Ni atom. Furthermore, we investigate the potential-dependent free energetics and dynamic properties at the electrochemical interface on the Ni1/SN3C catalyst using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with a full explicit solvent model. Based on the potential-dependent microkinetic model, we predict that S-atom doped Ni SAC shifts the onset potential of CO2 electroreduction from –0.88 to –0.80 V vs. RHE, exhibiting better activity. Overall, this work provides an in-depth understanding of structure-activity relationships and atomic-level electrochemical interfaces of catalytic systems, and offers insights into the rational design of heteroatom-doped catalysts for targeted catalysis.",
