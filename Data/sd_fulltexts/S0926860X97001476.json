Box 11 O, 116023 Dalian, China Received 14 January 1997; received in revised form 10 April 1997; accepted 10 April 1997 Abstract Unsupported Fe, Co and Ni catalysts are active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) at low temperature. A conversion of 1% is achieved at 585,438 and 487 K, respectively. The selectivity towards ethylene is found to be ca. 60% at low conversion. As the reaction temperature increases, the selectivity remains nearly constant for Ni whilst it decreases for Fe and Co. This behaviour has been explained by comparing the catalytic properties of Co and Ni towards ethane and ethylene oxidation. The ODHE intrinsic activity sequence (Co>Ni>Fe) is similar to that observed for the homomolecular exchange of oxygen, confirming that these catalysts are in an oxidized state in the course of the ODHE reaction. The study of the reduction and oxidation of unsupported and silica-supported nickel catalysts using magnetic methods has shown that the catalytic activity is not related to the ease of the NiZ+-Nitransition. TAP experiments carried out over Ni have revealed that the oxygen species involved in the reaction are irreversibly held by the catalyst at 573 K (possibly O-) from which a reaction mechanism is proposed. Furthermore, this series of experiments have shown that ethane is irreversibly adsorbed and that CO, originates from a parallel-consecutive scheme. ~) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The conversion of light alkanes to their correspond- ing olefins can be carried out through thermal crack- ing, catalytic dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydro- genation. The latter reaction has a number of advan- tages since complete conversion can be reached at low temperatures and high pressures. Furthermore, in the latter case, there is no need for supplying large amount of heat and due to the presence of oxygen, deactivation *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ,~, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, alkane reaction with oxygen over all known catalysts results also in the formation of carbon oxides, thermo- dynamically much more favoured, decreasing the selectivity towards olefins and limiting the potential of ODH reactions for applications [1,2]. From this viewpoint, research aimed at finding new catalysts achieving good performances at low temperatures, appears desirable. Attempts at running the oxidative coupling of methane at low temperatures have been made over group VIII metals: some significant results were 228 Y Schuurman et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 227-235 obtained with palladium at 600 K [3-5] whilst nickel was found to be very unselective [5]. This situation led us to examine to what extent such metals could also be utilized to carry out the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE), a reaction which demonstrates deep analogy with the former one [6,7]. Preliminary experi- ments [8] indicated that Pd leads mainly to total oxidation whilst Ni, surprisingly is active and selective at moderate temperatures (500-600 K). The high potentials of nickel-based catalysts have recently been confirmed: over Ni/AI203 catalysts, yields as high as 25% corresponding to a selectivity towards ethylene of 83% have been observed at 773 K [9]. In this work, we extend this study to other group VIII metals such as iron and cobalt and we address the question of the nature of active sites and mechanism, already tackled in another paper [ 10], in the light of new data obtained from a study of the oxygen-nickel system by magnet- ism and of the oxygen/ethane reactivity over nickel using the TAP technique (Temporal Analysis of Products). 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts at atmospheric pressure with a reacting mixture com- posed of ethane, oxygen (or ethylene in some com- plementary experiments) and helium (8, 3.1 and 90.2 kPa, respectively). The total flow rate was 3.6 1/h and the weight of catalyst was 0.1 g. The analysis was carried out by on-line gas chromatogra- phy (FID and TCD detectors). Magnetic measure- ments were carried out to calculate the amount of ferromagnetic zerovalent nickel [10] using the Weiss extraction method in fields up to 21 kOe (2.1 T) at room temperature. The saturation magnetization, Ms, was obtained from a plot of magnetization M, as a function of the reciprocal field strength, 1/H, and extrapolation at 1/H=O. The amount of ferromagnetic nickel present in the sample was calculated from its comparison with the specific saturation magnetization of bulk nickel. The fraction of ferromagnetic metal nickel, F, thus obtained, was studied in various redu- cing and oxidizing conditions to assess the role of the Ni2+-Ni transition ease. Reduction was carried out in flowing hydrogen (3.6 l/h) by linearly raising the temperature at 2 K/min to the selected temperature and maintaining the system at this temperature. The total time of reduction was 15 h. The oxidation pro- cedure involved the contact with air of the reduced sample for 15 min at increasing temperatures. Owing to the good results obtained with unsup- ported nickel [8], only unsupported group VIII metals were considered as a first step. Unsupported iron was obtained from the precipitation of Fe(OH)2 by adding ammonia (185 ml of a 28 wt% NH3 solution in 815 ml H20) to a solution of FeSO4 (278 g of FeSO4.7HeO into 1000ml H20) at 310 K and pH=8.5-8. The precipitate was washed and centrifugated six times, and finally dried. Unsupported cobalt was prepared by adding 26 ml of a 28 wt% NH3 solution to a solution of 200 ml containing 62.6 g of Co(NO3)2.6H20 at 295 K under argon to avoid Co2+ oxidation. The precipitate of Co(OH)2 was washed, centrifugated four times and dried at 353 K. Platinum and palladium blacks were provided by Engelhard. The Ni/SiO2 catalyst was obtained using the ammonia method [ 10]. 2.2. Reactor and characterization techniques As described in more detail elsewhere [10], the reaction was carried out in a quartz fixed-bed reactor 2.3. Transient experiments Transient pulse experiments over Ni(OH)2 were performed in a TAP-2 reactor. A TAP experiment consists of introducing narrow gas pulses of reactants in a microreactor which is evacuated continuously. The response of this pulse is detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer at the reactor exit. The shape of the response reflects diffusion, adsorption, desorption and reaction of the reactants and products. The principle of the TAP experiment and its applications are exten- sively described by Gleaves et al. [11]. The commercial TAP-2 reactor contains four high- speed pulse valves, a microreactor, a liquid nitrogen trapped vacuum system, and a quadrupole mass spec- trometer located directly underneath the reactor exit. The microreactor measures 25.4 mm in length and 4.1 mm in diameter. A heating element is wrapped around the reactor and is controlled by a temperature controller which reads the output of the thermocouple located in the catalyst bed. Y Schuurman et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 227-235 229 For this study 95 mg of Ni(OH)2 with a particle size of 0.2-0.3 mm was placed in the centre of the reactor between two layers of 0.2-0.3 mm size quartz parti- cles. This way an uniform temperature profile along the catalyst bed is assured. The reactor was heated under a flow of He of 30 ml/min at a heating rate of YC/min to 300. The reactor was kept at 300 under a flow of He of 30 ml/min for 1 h. The He flow rate was then doubled and pulses of ethane/argon were introduced in the helium flow. The transient responses obtained at the reactor exit give information on the reaction mechanism. Kinetic parameters can be obtained by fitting the transient response to a mathematical model based on a reaction sequence. The ethane and ethylene responses were modelled according to the following procedure. The pulse intensities were kept sufficiently small to ensure Knudsen flow. In the Knudsen flow mode the colli- sions between molecules in the gas phase are negli- gible. This excludes gas phase reactions and eliminates the term for convective transport and hence simplifies the model. The Knudsen diffusivities for ethane and ethylene in the different zones were calculated from the argon response obtained in different experiments. The ethane and ethylene responses were modelled by trying different reaction mechanisms with only the kinetic constants as fitting parameters. The main differences between the different mechanisms consid- ered were: A reversible versus an irreversible disso- ciative ethane adsorption, and a parallel versus a consecutive CO2 production. The method to solve the partial differential equations which describe the transport and reaction through the TAP reactor are described by Svoboda et al. [12]. For more details on the set of partial differential equations that describe the transport of gas through the microreactor, the reader is referred to Ref. [13]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Specificity of group VIII metals The temperatures corresponding to a conversion of 1% of ethane are found to be 438, 483, 487, 508 and 585 K for unsupported Co, Pd, Ni, Pt and Fe catalysts, respectively. Unsupported Pd and Pt lead mainly to deep oxidation into CO2 and H20. Trace amounts of methane are observed over Pt and some ethylene is formed with Pd (the selectivity towards ethylene is found to be 2% at 670 K), confirming, in the latter case, the results obtained over Pd/SiO2 catalysts [8]. In contrast to noble metals, unsupported Fe, Co and Ni catalysts demonstrate good selectivity towards ethy- lene, as shown in Fig. 1. Methane, C3+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates are not detected in the reaction products. Together with ethylene, CO2 is formed over Co and Ni catalysts whilst Fe gives a mixture of CO+CO2; the molar ratio CO/(CO+CO2) increases continuously from 50% to 63% as temperature increases from 543 to 703 K (further experiments are under way to better understand the specific beha- viour of iron towards the formation of carbon oxides). For the case of Co and Fe catalysts, the selectivity towards ethylene decreases as temperature and con- version increases. This behaviour contrasts with that of Ni, for which the selectivity does not vary to a large extent when T increases. The difference of behaviour between nickel and cobalt could be the reflection of the difference of reactivity towards ethylene. Fig. 2 compares the cata- lytic properties of unsupported cobalt and nickel catalysts towards ethane and ethylene oxidation. As can be seen, the corresponding curves obtained over cobalt are more or less superimposed, indicating that the reaction constants for ethane and ethylene oxida- tion, kI and kn, respectively, are nearly equal: This strongly suggests that over cobalt ethylene is subse- quently oxidized into degradation products, explain- ing why the selectivity towards ethylene decreases as temperature increases. In contrast, the difference of reactivity between ethane and ethylene observed over nickel (kli<k[) suggests that the consecutive reaction (dashed arrow) is less important than over the cobalt catalyst.

The BET surface areas of unsupported cobalt, nickel and iron catalysts after reaction are found to be 115, 160 and 17 me~g, respectively. The intrinsic activity (per unit area) thus calculated leads to the following sequence: Co > Ni > Fe (2) The latter sequence is the same as that reported by Boreskov [14] for several reactions, such as oxidation of hydrogen, oxidation of methane, nitrogen oxide decomposition and homomolecular exchange of oxygen (1602 _~_18 02 ~ 2160180) at 673 K. In the latter case, where only gaseous oxygen is present, catalysts are likely to be in an oxidized state. Based on the sequence analogy, it can be inferred that the situation is similar for cobalt, nickel and iron catalysts in the course of the ODHE reaction and that they are oxidized in working con- ditions. This confirms previous conclusions reached for unsupported and silica-supported nickel cata- lysts on the basis of infrared spectroscopy, magnetic and BET surface area measurements [10]. In the following part of this study, devoted to the question of mechanism and active sites, we focus on nickel, the most attractive candidate for this reaction. More spe- cifically, we examine whether the active species involved in ethylene formation is 02- (study of the oxygen-nickel system by magnetic methods), gas- phase 02 or electrophilic species such as O2 and O (study of the ODHE over Ni using transient pulses). 3.2. Study of the oxygen-nickel system by magnetic method The ODHE reaction over nickel catalysts might be related to the ease of the Mn+-Mtransition, which also corresponds to a high oxygen mobility in the oxide lattice [15]. This occurrence would correspond to the following equations: C2H6 + Ni2+ + 02. -~ CH2=CH2 + H20 + [] I (3) Ni CH2=CH2 + 02 + [] --) C2H4 + Ni2+ 02\" I Ni (4) where [] denotes an anionic vacancy. This possibility has led us to compare the redox properties of unsupported and silica-supported nickel catalysts which demonstrate very different catalytic activities [8,10] as illustrated by Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the molar fraction of reduced nickel (degree of reduc- tion) as a function of the reduction temperature. As can be seen, during the first reduction of the supported catalyst silica play an inhibiting role which probably arises from the formation of two-dimensional basic nickel silicates, Nix(OH)y(SizO5)z, which are less easily reducible than Ni(OH)2 or NiO [16-18]. After complete oxidation of the reduced Ni/SiO2 in air at 623 K (Fig. 4), a second reduction was carried out. The latter one occurs at a much lower temperature and the reduction curve thus obtained is near that corre- sponding to the unsupported catalyst, showing that the inhibiting role of silica is decreased and that NiO is likely to be formed after oxidation in air. Fig. 5 illustrates the oxidation process. As can be seen the oxidation of silica-supported nickel catalysts reduced at 873 K proceeds at low temperatures. The temperatures corresponding to F=50% are found to be 323 and 523 K for supported and unsupported nickel catalysts, respectively. The easier oxidation of Ni/ SiO2 catalyst may result from its better dispersion: as a matter of fact, the nickel particle size is found to be 4.9 nm by magnetic methods, which, assuming a cubo-octahedral shape, corresponds to a dispersion of 25%, whilst the BET surface area of the reduced unsupported nickel is equal to 10 mJg (dispersion, 1.5% assuming an average surface area of 0.065 nm2 for one nickel atom). To check the validity of this assumption, the Ni/SiO2 catalyst has been reduced at 1200 K; the resulting nickel particle size has increased to 12.3 nm (dispersion, 10%). Fig. 5 shows that the corresponding oxidation curve is very near to that obtained for reduced unsupported nickel. This series of experiments has thus demonstrated that the ease of the Ni2+-Nitransition is nearly the same for unsup- ported and supported nickel catalysts, as tar as the latter solid has already been reduced. 232 Y.

Y. Schuurman et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 227-235 233 In contrast, catalytic activities are very different (Fig. 3): The reaction temperatures at 10% ethane conversion are found to be 537 and 693 K for unsup- ported and silica-supported catalyst after pre-reduc- tion and oxidation at 873 K, respectively. It is difficult to compare activities on a unit area basis (intrinsic activities) since the surface area of the nickel-contain- ing phase of silica-supported catalysts is not known; however, some crude approximations can be pro- posed: The nickel phase may be spread over the silica support, i.e. 200 m2/g of catalyst. Conversely it can be speculated that nickel oxide particles are agglomer- ated into spheres corresponding to those observed in the reduced state (diameter, 4.9 nm, according to magnetic measurements). The specific surface area of NiO is found to be 92 m2/g of NiO and 18 m2/g of catalyst since the loading is approximately 20%. In other words the nickel surface of Ni/SiO2 catalysts which is comprised between ca. 20 and 200 m2/g of catalyst, is equivalent to that of the unsupported catalysts (ca. 200 m2/g of catalyst) or one order of magnitude smaller. Now if one compares ethane con- versions at 575 K over unsupported and pre-reduced, subsequently oxidized supported catalysts which demonstrate similar redox properties, two orders of magnitude are observed. This shows that the intrinsic activity of unsupported nickel is, at least, one order of magnitude higher than that of the supported catalyst, strongly suggesting that the ODHE reaction over nickel oxides is not directly related to the ease of the Ni2+-Nitransition, and that the mechanism which is illustrated by Eqs. (3) and (4) can be ruled out. However satisfying this reasoning may be, it cannot be overlooked that this conclusion was reached by comparing catalytic data, which are essentially related to surface phenomena, with the redox proper- ties of bulk nickel. Further arguments are needed to assess more definitely the validity of this conclusion. 3.3. Study of the ODHE reaction over Ni using transient pulses duced in the flow. For these conditions ethylene was observed. Subsequently the flow was stopped. Re- oxidation of the catalyst was carried out by rapidly pulsing oxygen under vacuum conditions and pulses of ethane/argon were introduced. Ethylene formation was again observed. Continuing pulses of ethane resulted in a decreasing ethylene formation. The initial ethylene level could be restored after oxidizing the catalyst by oxygen pulses. It can therefore be concluded from this series of experiments that the oxygen species involved in the reaction mechanism is not the gas phase dioxygen molecule: It is irreversibly held by the catalyst at 300. If one excludes 02- lattice species as sug- gested above, a plausible candidate is O- which is more stable than Oz- [9,19] and which has already been proposed as active species for the ODHE over OCM catalysts [20]. The following reaction mechan- ism may be proposed: C2H6 + O- ---+ C2H5 + OH (5) C2H5 + O ---* C2H4 q- OH- (6) 2OH ~ H20 + 02- + [] (7) 02 Jr- [] q-2 ~ 20- (8) where [] denotes an oxygen vacancy. The transient responses of ethane, ethylene and argon from an ethane/argon pulse at vacuum condi- tions are shown in Fig. 6. This figure shows that the ethane response exits well before the inert argon gas and showing a more narrow response, indicating a conversion of ethane. The ethylene pulse exits after the ethane pulse, typical for a product response, but the response is rather narrow, indicating a consecutive reaction. These observations were confirmed by fitting the responses to a model based on the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1. In this scheme, which is equivalent to (1), stars denote adsorbed species. A good fit between calculated curves and experi- mental points is achieved assuming that the desorption After the unsupported nickel catalyst was heated to 300 under a flow of helium as described in Sec- tion 2, neither ethylene nor carbon dioxide was formed on ethane pulse. Next a mixture of helium (45 ml/min) and oxygen (15 ml/min) was passed over the catalyst.

The response of ethylene as shown in Fig. 6 (full lines) can only be obtained if an instantaneous surface reaction of the ethane surface intermediate is assumed, followed by desorption and readsorption of ethylene and a con- secutive surface reaction of the adsorbed ethylene to an adsorbed precursor of CO2 in equilibrium with CO2. This confirms that an important fraction of CO2 results from the subsequent oxidation of ethylene although the reaction constant kn is substantially smaller than k~, the reaction constant of ethane oxida- tion. 4. Conclusion increases, it remains nearly constant for nickel whilst it decreases for Co and Fe, making Ni-based catalysts the most attractive candidate for this reaction. This behaviour has been explained on the basis of the difference between ethane and ethylene reactivities. Further evidence for the oxidized state of nickel in working conditions have been provided. TAP experi- ments strongly suggest that the ODHE reaction over nickel involves a parallel-consecutive scheme for CO2 formation and that ethane is irreversibly adsorbed. The occurrence of a redox mechanism, based on the ease of the NiZ+-Nitransition has been ruled out. The oxy- gen species involved in the reaction is irreversibly held by the catalyst and it is suggested that O- would abstract hydrogen atoms from the ethane molecule to give ethylene. This study has therefore demonstrated that in con- trast to Pt and Pd which lead to deep oxidation, unsupported Fe, Co and Ni give interesting results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at low temperature. The selectivity towards ethylene is found to be ca. 60% at low conversion for Fe and Ni.

Low temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over catalysts based on group VIII metals Y. Schuurman a V. Ducarme a T. Chen b W. Li b C. Mirodatos a G.A.

Box 110, 116023 Dalian, China * Corresponding author. Unsupported Fe, Co and Ni catalysts are active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) at low temperature. A conversion of 1% is achieved at 585, 438 and 487 K, respectively. The selectivity towards ethylene is found to be ca. 60% at low conversion. As the reaction temperature increases, the selectivity remains nearly constant for Ni whilst it decreases for Fe and Co. This behaviour has been explained by comparing the catalytic properties of Co and Ni towards ethane and ethylene oxidation. The ODHE intrinsic activity sequence (Co>Ni>Fe) is similar to that observed for the homomolecular exchange of oxygen, confirming that these catalysts are in an oxidized state in the course of the ODHE reaction. The study of the reduction and oxidation of unsupported and silica-supported nickel catalysts using magnetic methods has shown that the catalytic activity is not related to the ease of the Ni2+ Ni0 transition. TAP experiments carried out over Ni have revealed that the oxygen species involved in the reaction are irreversibly held by the catalyst at 573 K (possibly O−) from which a reaction mechanism is proposed. Furthermore, this series of experiments have shown that ethane is irreversibly adsorbed and that CO2 originates from a parallel-consecutive scheme.
