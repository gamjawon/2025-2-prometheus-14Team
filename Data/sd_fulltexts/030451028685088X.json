R. RICHARDS, H. H. KUNG and W. M. H. SACHTLER* Ipatieff Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60201 (U. S. A.) (Received September 25,1985; accepted February 3,1986) Summary Ni/SiOa catalysts, which have been 'modified* with (J2,i2)-(+)-tartaric acid (TA) are used for the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl aceto- acetate to (.R)-( )-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate. Auger Electron Emission spec- troscopy has been employed to assess the uniformity of the modification through the catalyst pellet. Conditions have been identified to achieve high uniformity. The traction of the metal surface left bare after modification is estimated by the rates of 1-hexene hydrogenation at low temperature before and after modification. Even when this fraction is very low, the enantioselectivity in the absence of co-modifiers remains near 50%. It is suggested that this value reflects the intrinsic selectivity of the asymmetric sites. Higher selectivities achieved by adding a co-modifier are due to an enhanced intrinsic selectivity of such sites, not to a blockage of bare nickel. Introduction The ability of tartaric acid-modified nickel to produce an optically active product when catalyzing the hydrogenation of a prochiral reactant, has been known for quite some time [1]. This unique ability is induced by the asymmetry of the optically active tartaric acid modifier. The test reaction that has been used by several groups is the hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate (MAA) to methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB). A number of variables have been investigated in terms of their effect on the degree of enantioselectivity. Varying the concentration of tartaric acid in the modifying solution over a wide range has been shown to have little effect [2]. Similarly, extending the time of modification has little effect [2]; after approximately 30 min at 0 C no farther increase in enantioselectivity is achieved. These data suggest that the coverage of the nickel surface is *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-8102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 330 virtually complete at very low tartaric acid concentration and in a relatively short time. An increase in the temperature of modification, over the range 0 to 100 C, results in an increase in enantioselectivity [1]. Apparently, the modification is more efficient at higher temperatures, although it also leaches away more nickel. The dependence of the enantioselectivity on the pH of the modification solution is somewhat puzzling. There is good evidence that pH 5 results in the highest enantioselectivity [I], but some authors report a broad maximum from pH 5 to pH 9 [3] or even a second maximum at pH 10 [4]. It has been proposed that the pH controls either the mode of adsorption, or the degree of coverage, or both. The enantioselec- tivity depends, for a given catalyst modification, on the reaction tempera- ture, and is the highest at 55 to 60 C [5]. While much research has been done on this system, a complete under- standing of it has not yet been attained. In order to explain the varying degrees of enantioselectivity, two types of sites have been assumed to be present on the catalyst: selective and non-selective. Selective sites are associated with the tartaric acid modifier and produce an optically active product, while the non-selective sites are assumed to be unmodified nickel sites and produce a racemic mixture. This classification does not exclude further differentiation of sites in sub-groups; i.e., the intrinsic selectivity as understood in this paper might be an average value for several types of coexisting selective sites. Given the presence of the two types of sites, the ultimate selectivity is then limited by: (1) the concentration of the selective sites, (2) the turnover frequency on each site, and (3) the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites. The increase of the enantioselectivity caused by addition of alkali halides [6] could then be due either to poisoning of non-selective sites [7] or to an enhancement of the intrinsic selectivity of selective sites [8,9]. The latter model necessarily implies an intrinsic selectivity less than 100% in the absence of alkali halides. Research in this paper is aimed at maximizing the surface concentration of selective sites and identifying their intrinsic selectivity. Selectivities have been measured for the gas phase hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate to methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate using a Ni/SiOz catalyst modified with (.R,.R')-tartaric acid. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) has been employed to measure the overall coverage of the catalyst with modifier, gearing our experimental procedure to obtain homogeneous modification over the catalyst pellet. The hydrogenation of 1-hexene at low temperature has been used to estimate the fraction of the metal surface that was left bare after modification. Experimental The Ni/SiO^ catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the silica with a nickel nitrate solution. The silica used was a large pore (~60 nm) sample, kindly supplied by Koninklijke/Shell Laboratorium Amsterdam, in ~2 mm 331 spheres. The impregnated catalysts were dried at 70 C overnight and calcined in helium at 350 C for 1 h. Prior to modification, the catalysts were reduced at 400 C in flowing hydrogen (100 ml min\"1) for 16 h. Modifica- tion of the catalyst was done with 100 ml of an aqueous solution of tartaric acid (0.01 - 5.0 wt.%) adjusted to pH 5.0 with NaOH. Modification was performed at either room temperature (~25 C) or 100 C, and the length of modification time was also varied. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in flowing hydrogen (100 ml min\"1) which was bubbled through a saturator at room temperature containing the methyl acetoacetate. The reaction was carried out between 55 and 60 C, and liquid products were condensed for analysis. The reaction was run for 8 -12 h to allow a steady state to be reached before the sample was collected for analysis. Product analysis was performed by gas-liquid chromatography. A 3 m column of 10% Carbowax terephthalic acid on Chromosorb W/AW was used for MAA/MHB, and a 50 m capillary column of crosslinked methyl silicone was used for hexene/hexane. The optical rotation of the MHB was measured using a Cary-60 spectropolarimeter at 589 nm, the sodium D line. AES analyses were performed with a Physical Electronics 590A Scanning Auger Microprobe. The base pressure in the spectrometer was usually in the upper 10~9 torr range. An electron beam current of 0.5 to 1.1 JUA, a beam energy of 2 keV, a beam size of ~ 2 /xm and a modulation amplitude of 6 eV were used when the AES spectra were recorded. The hydrogenation of 1-hexene was carried out at 55, 0 and 14 C (ethylene glycol-dry ice slush bath) and a hydrogen flow of 140 ml min~1. The hydrogen was bubbled through a saturator containing 1-hexene at 0 or 14 C. Results and discussion Since it is the treatment with tartaric acid which transforms the Ni/ SiO-i into an enantioselective catalyst, it was felt desirable to determine the amount of tartaric acid adsorbed and to examine whether its surface concen- tration could be correlated to the enantioselectivity. Several authors have measured and correlated the amount of tartaric acid adsorbed with varying pH [10], but the coverage at optimum pH is not known with certainty. Preliminary work had indicated a linear correlation between the C/Ni AES peak intensity ratio and enantioselectivity [II], but the degree of experimental uncertainty and a large carbon background made the data inconclusive. Also in the present work, the information value of AES data is limited due to the impossibility of cleaning the modified catalysts by typical UHV techniques, without destroying tine tartrate. A large carbon background is therefore usually present. Figure 1 shows the results for samples, modified at pH = 5. Enantioselectivities of 40 - 45% were obtained, but once a critical concentration of the modifier was present, the enantioselectivity remained approximately constant. 332 50- 40- 30- 20- 10- 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 C/Ni Fig. 1. Relationship of tartaric acid coverage (C/Ni) to enantioselectivity. The AES data provide, however, relevant information on the concentra- tion gradient of the tartrate overlayer in the catalyst pellets. Whereas for non-crushed catalysts only the exterior of the pellet contributed to the AES signal, the interior of the pellet was exposed by crushing. For catalysts modified in the traditional way, the data in Table 1 show that the C/Ni ratio of the exterior is significantly greater than that of the interior, the former approaching the value of bulk nickel tartrate. Evidently the interior of these pellets was poorly modified or perhaps unmodified. This conclusion was con- firmed by comparing the selectivities obtained before and after crushing the pellets. In order to avoid contamination during crushing, we crushed the catalysts in methanol after proving that contamination by methanol has an insignificant influence on the selectivity (38% before, 34% after immersion in methanol). We found that crushing reduced the selectivity from, typically, TABLE 1 AES analysis of Ni/SiOz catalysts Sample Modification8 Crushed C/Nib TA (wt.%) Time (h) 1 , . 0.51 2 - - + 1.15 3 2 2 2.0 4 2 2 + 0.80 5 3 2 1.4 6 3 2 + 0.90 7 2 1.5 0.70 NiTA^HC - - - 1.6 \"Modification done with 100 ml of solution, pH 5 at 100 C. bAuger peaks: C, 270 eV; Ni, 848 eV. cNickel tartrate. 333 34 to 11%. This confirms earlier results of Bostelaar [19] for similar prepa- rations. He reported selectivities of 37% before, but 13% after crushing. A more uniform modification of the catalyst pellets was achieved by reducing the external pressure temporarily to 25 torr during modification, in order to remove gas plugs from catalyst pores. For these catalysts, the decrease in selectivity due to crushing in methanol was much smaller than for the poorly modified samples, e.g. 38.6% before and 28.1% after crushing. Although in these samples the interior of the catalysts was much better modified, the selectivity of these catalysts was not higher than for the poorly modified samples before crushing. We therefore conclude that in the hydro- genation of MAA under the conditions used by us, the interior of the pellet is hardly utilized, i.e. the reaction is pore diffusion-controlled. This conclu- sion is consistent with earlier results by Woerde et al. [12]. A much more important conclusion is, however, that also the well-modified parts of these catalysts give rise to moderate selectivities. This suggests that the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites is significantly lower than 100%. This conclusion, if correct, would imply that it is princi- pally impossible to achieve much higher selectivities merely by completely converting all non-selective sites (i.e. bare Ni surface atoms) into selective sites (i.e. Ni tartrate complexes). In order to check this important conclu- sion, we decided to do experiments which can quantify which fraction of the nickel surface is left bare after careful modification of our catalyst. For this purpose, we used the hydrogenation of 1-hexene to probe the surface for unmodified sites. The hydrogenation was carried out on both modified and unmodified catalysts, and the ratio of the 1-hexene conver- sions under identical conditions conversion on modified Ni x = conversion on unmodified Ni is characteristic of the fraction of Ni sites not covered by tartrate. A linear relation l=x +9 TA where 0TA stands for the fraction covered with tartrate, will be valid only for a homogeneous surface and 1-hexene conversion rates in the kinetic regime, where conversion and rate constant are linearly related. However, the quantity (1 x) remains a useful yardstick also outside this regime, as it provides a lower limit to the true fraction of the surface covered by tartaric acid or tartrate. In particular, in the limiting case x 0, of predominant interest in the present context, one may conclude that the surface is virtually completely covered with tartrate adsorption complexes. These experiments were carried out as follows. An unmodified catalyst was first used for 1-hexene hydrogenation. Following the hydrogenation on this catalyst, the catalyst was reduced again at 400 C in flowing hydrogen for 16 h to remove any hydrocarbonaceous residues. After cooling to room 334 temperature, the sample was modified with various concentrations of tartaric acid, and following the drying of the catalyst, the 1-hexene hydrogenation was performed again. Modification of the catalyst for these experiments was done at a lower temperature (25 C) than usual to minimize the leaching of nickel from the catalyst. After the second 1-hexene hydrogenation, the catalyst was used for MAA hydrogenation to determine its enantioselec- tivity. Results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2. The most salient result of this study is that a very large portion of the surface has become inactive for hydrogenation of 1-hexene after modification; evidently most of the nickel surface is covered with tartrate. However, as can be seen in Fig. 2, even at high coverages (>90%) the enantioselectivity is still significantly below 100%. These results would support the model of virtually complete coverage by selective sites of intrinsic enantioselectivity near 40%. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Fig. 2. Relationship of enantioselectivity and tartaric acid coverage as measured by 1-hexene hydrogenation (x = henene conv. mod./hexene conv. unmod.), Whereas adsorbed tartaric acid evidently poisons the surface for the hydrogenation of hexene, its effect on the rate of hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate is quite different. To demonstrate this, we measured the conver- sion of MAA following the 1-hexene hydrogenation, both before and after modification. Typical results are shown in Table 2. They agree with the literature, where it has been reported that modified catalysts are as active or more active for the hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate than unmodified catalysts [9, 13]. The MAA conversion does not decrease, which shows that tartaric acid is not acting as a universal surface poison, but that it forms sites for the hydrogenation of MAA. This supports our model [14] that chemi- sorption of tartaric acid is of the corrosive type and the nickel tartrate surface complexes are the sites for methyl acetoacetate adsorption, while hydrogenation makes use of the spillover of H atoms from the nickel surface, below or near the nickel tartrate, where dihydrogen is dissociatively adsorbed. 5' * / 10 c- a> cc 00 T-I CO (1) M CO 00 d 0 e c & ~^- <D N o i-l Oi C~ 0 (0 ^ 00 S fi 0 0 ^,)s9 & d C 0 0 (N IM (M 2 i !

Ni atoms in these complexes might act as active sites for hydrogenation in a way similar to the Ni atoms in the tartrate complexes in the case of the modified catalysts. The sizes of Ni MAA chelate and nickel tartrate complexes are somewhat different, and so are the activation energies for hydrogenation of MAA on them. Bostelaar found AJf* = 57 4 kJ moF1 and AS* = -110 J mol\"1 K~1 for unmodified, but AJ^t = 46 3 kJ moF1 and AS* = 140 J mol~1 K~1 for modified nickel catalysts [9]. The hydrogenation of 1-hexene on transition metals is a much more facile reaction than the hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate on chelate- covered nickel. The extrapolated turnover frequencies at equal temperature are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher. Therefore, we have studied the hydro- genation of 1-hexene at significantly lower temperatures and higher partial pressures of the unsaturated molecules than is feasible for MAA. Although it cannot be excluded that Ni chelate complexes might also be able to catalyze the hydrogenation of 1-hexene at a rate similar to the hydrogenation of MAA, this possibility is of no significance in the context of the present work, because such a reaction rate is several orders of magnitude lower than that on the 'bare' Ni sites and therefore negligible. In this context, 'bare nickel' is to be understood as being a Ni surface covered only with those CH^ complexes which are characteristic of the steady state of olefin hydrogenation on Ni metal. Since we are now able to estimate the surface coverage of tartrate and to measure the enantioselectivity independently, it is of interest to see how these two parameters are related. Figure 2 shows that enantioselectivity first increases with tartrate coverage, as expected. At higher coverages, however, it passes through a maximum and decreases to a value as low as 16%, from the maximum of 38%, when the severity of modification is increased (by using up to 5 wt.% tartaric acid). A possible explanation for this decrease in enantioselectivity would be the formation of multilayers of nickel tartrate on the catalyst surface. This is supported by the AES results, which show that in a region of constant enantioselectivity, the C/Ni ratio increases and approaches the value of bulk nickel tartrate. No selectivity maximum has been found with those samples which had been modified with either 2 or 3 wt.% tartaric acid solutions. The resulting coverage will be smaller than for samples modified with more concentrated solutions and corresponds to x values where Fig. 2 has a rather broad maximum. The decrease in enantio- selectivity at high concentrations became apparent only after modifying with a 5 wt.% solution. The low coverage point (ES = 7%) in Fig. 2 was obtained with a 0.013 wt.% solution. It is seen that large differences in concentration are required to cause significant changes in enantioselectivity. Further differences in enantioselectivity under similar modifier con- centrations between samples used for the AES experiments and those of the 337 1-hexene hydrogenation experiments could be attributed to the modification temperature. The catalysts used in the Auger experiments were modified at 100 C, those in the 1-hexene experiments at 25 C. As mentioned earlier, it is generally found that higher modification temperatures lead to higher enan- tioselectivities. Hoek [11] reports that Ni/SiOz catalysts modified with nickel tartrate had a measurable enantioselectivity, but that it was lower than that of catalysts modified with tartaric acid. This could indicate that surface nickel tartrate which was identified by IR [16] is not identical with bulk nickel tartrate, possibly in terms of orientation or mode of adsorption on the surface. The discovery that a fully modified catalyst has an intrinsic selectivity of 40 - 60%, at any rate much less than 100%, leads to possible explanations for other effects. The role of alkali halides as selectivity promoters has been much debated [6-9], and a number of possible explanations have been proposed, including: (1) more tartaric acids deposited onto the catalyst by shifting the equilibrium defined by the solubility products [11]; (2) non- selective (unmodified) sites are selectively blocked [7]; (3) the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites is changed [8, 9]. Since the present 1-hexene hydrogenation experiments show that catalysts can be obtained with nearly complete coverage by tartaric acid, it does not seem that the first two explanations can account for most of the observed alkali halide promoter effect (although residual unmodified sites present would possibly adsorb alkali halides). Our present results show that the third explanation is quite probable. The alkali ion could be associated with the oxygen atoms of the tartrate ligands giving them a more rigid structure, and a more well-defined template leading to a higher enantioselectivity [17].

Ni/SiO2 catalysts, which have been ‘modified’ with (R,R)-(+)-tartaric acid (TA) are used for the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate to (R)-(−)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate. Auger Electron Emission spectroscopy has been employed to assess the uniformity of the modification through the catalyst pellet. Conditions have been identified to achieve high uniformity. The fraction of the metal surface left bare after modification is estimated by the rates of 1-hexene hydrogenation at low temperature before and after modification. Even when this fraction is very low, the enantioselectivity in the absence of co-modifiers remains near 50%. It is suggested that this value reflects the intrinsic selectivity of the asymmetric sites. Higher selectivities achieved by adding a co-modifier are due to an enhanced intrinsic selectivity of such sites, not to a blockage of bare nickel. References 1 Y. Izumi M. Imaida H. Fukawa S.

Auger Electron Emission spectroscopy has been employed to assess the uniformity of the modification through the catalyst pellet. Conditions have been identified to achieve high uniformity. The fraction of the metal surface left bare after modification is estimated by the rates of 1-hexene hydrogenation at low temperature before and after modification. Even when this fraction is very low, the enantioselectivity in the absence of co-modifiers remains near 50%. It is suggested that this value reflects the intrinsic selectivity of the asymmetric sites. Higher selectivities achieved by adding a co-modifier are due to an enhanced intrinsic selectivity of such sites, not to a blockage of bare nickel.",
