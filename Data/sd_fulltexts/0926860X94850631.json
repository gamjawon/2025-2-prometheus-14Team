Introduction Transition metal chalcogenides have attracted scientific interest because of their peculiar structure and properties, and wide range of opportunities for application: batteries, super- conductors, catalysts, etc. [ 1 ]. Sulfur-containing chalcogenides of some transition metals (Mo, W) are the most widely used and effective hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts [2]. To increase the activity of those classical catalysts, promoters like cobalt and nickel are used, as well as so-called second promoters (phosphorus, fluorine) [ 3 ]. Parallel with this, a lively discussion about the nature of the active sites, the role of the promoter, and the reaction mechanism is going on [ 3-5]. The aim of the present work is to study the NIPS3 chalcogenide which has not been utilized, until now, for this reaction. The catalytic activity of NIPS3, supported on 'y-AI203, was compared with that of commercial CoMo/A1203 and NiMo/A1203 catalysts. Its hydro- genation and isomerization activity was also followed. Based on the presented data and on *Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 35-92)724901, fax. ( + 35-92)756116, e-mail BANCHEM@BGEARN.BITNET. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental 2.1. Sample preparation Polycrystalline NIPS3 was prepared by annealing a mixture of powdered nickel, sulfur, and red phosphorus in an evacuated quartz tube. That mixture was thoroughly ground beforehand in an agate mortar [6]. Heating was carried out at 700for 120 h followed by cooling to ambient temperature at 5h-~ [2]. Phase purity was monitored through X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ) [ 7 ]. The specific surface area of the powdered product was about 2 m2 --I g The catalyst was prepared by mechanical mixing of 10 wt.-% NIPS3 with 90 wt.-% 3,_ A1203, BET area about 220 m2 g ~, in a Pulverisat 5 planetary mill supplied by Fritch. Throughout the text this sample is denoted as NIPS3/A1203. Commercial CoMo/A1203 and CoNi/ALO3 catalysts were also studied for comparative purposes. The former catalyst contained4 wt.-% CoO and 13 wt.-% MOO3, whereas the latter contained 3 wt.-% NiO and 15 wt.-% MoO3, in both cases supported on T-A1203. 70 60 50 0 3 0 Fig. 1.

Preliminary sample treatment and activation L 99 The samples were dried at 120 for 1 h in argon flow and heated to 400 in a stream of hydrogen. This temperature was kept for 2 h. Sulfidation was performed at 400 in a hydrogen-hydrogen sulfide mixture (9:1). Preliminary reduction led to a slight decrease in activity, but the catalyst attained the steady state faster. 2.3. Catalytic activity Thiophene hydrodesulfurization was conducted in a stainless-steel flow-circulating sys- tem (recycle reactor). The reactor was loaded with 1 g of catalyst of 0.2-0.6 mm pellet size. Analysis of the reaction products was made on a gas chromatograph connected to the apparatus via a six-way valve. The analytical methods and apparatus are described elsewhere [8]. All the experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure in the 250-420 range and with a hydrogen-thiophene gas ratio of 10:1. Catalytic activity measurements were performed only after attaining a steady composition of the mixture at the reactor outlet. The catalytic activity was measured by the rate of thiophene hydrodesulfurization, that is, moles of thiophene (mol,ru) converted over one gram atom of metal (gaM) in the catalyst per hour (h) : molvHga~ ' h- ~. In the case of CoMo/Al203 and NiMo/A1203 we considered the sum of Co + Mo or Ni + Mo. The hydrogenation activity was expressed by the amount of butane (%) in the mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons (reaction products): butane, 1- butene, trans-2-butene, and cis-2-butene. The isomerization activity of the investigated catalysts was monitored through the concentration trans:cis ratio of 2-butene (Ct ........ /C,.g,). 3. Results Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the catalytic activity of the three NIPS3/ r\" I,O3, CoMo/AI203 and NiMo/AI203 samples in thiophene hydrodesulfurization. The reaction rates over these catalysts are comparable, demonstrating in general a linear depend- ence on temperature. Hydrogenation activity data on the investigated catalysts, acquired by monitoring butane content in the hydrocarbon mixture, are presented in Fig. 3. The following order of activities was observed: NiMo/A1203 > NiPSs/A1203 > CoMo/AI203. Fig. 4 shows results of the isomerization activity of the samples studied, expressed as the concentration trans : cis ratio of 2-butene in the hydrocarbon part of products. In this case the order of activities was: NiPS3/AI203 > NiMo/AI203 > CoMo/AI203. LIO0 A. Andreev et al. / Appl. Catal.

Discussion The CoMo/A1203 and NiMo/AI203 commercial catalysts, used in this study, are among the most active in thiophene hydrodesulfurization. That is why comparing their activity with that of the NiPS3/A1203 sample (Fig. 2) leads to the conclusion that NIPS3 has a high activity in thiophene HDS. Data on the hydrogenation and isomerization activity (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively) corroborated that those samples are comparable. It should be noted, however, that part of the metal in the NiMo/AI203 and CoMo/A1203 samples is \"lost\" as small quantities of non-sulfided species (alunlinates). On the other hand, the preparation procedure for NiPS3/A1203 (mechanical mixing) led to a lower nickel dispersion in com- parison with the dispersion of the active components in the other samples. The promoting effect of phosphorus on the HDS activity of Mo/A1203 and Ni (Co)Mo/ A1203 has been discussed in the patent literature for a long time [9-12] but its role in these catalytic systems was considered in the scientific literature only during the past years [ 13- 18]. The influence of phosphorus has mostly been explained by a change of the dispersion of the active components [ 13-15 ] and/or by an increase of the Ni2 + / Oh/ions [ 16,17 ] that participate in the formation of the catalytically active phase. The possibility that phosphorus promotes the formation of the active Ni-Mo II type structures has also been discussed [ 18]. Results of the formation of Ni(thio)-phosphate structures (species) in P-Ni/C and P-Ni- Mo/C catalysts, which exhibit considerable hydrodenitrogenation activity, are of interest, too [ 19]. The high activity in thiophene hydrodesulfurization demonstrated by the NiPS3-based sample suggests another explanation of the promoting effect of phosphorus on the activity of the NiMo/AI203 catalysts. Under reaction conditions and in the presence of highly dispersed active components in the supported samples, a highly dispersed phase of NIPS3 or its surface analogue might be formed which exhibits a high and specific HDS activity. Preliminary data [20] showed that COPS3 manifested a high HDS activity as well and, by LI02 A. Andreev et al. / Appl. Catal. A 108 (1994) L97-LI05 analogy, a connection with the promoting effect of phosphorus on the CoMo/A1203 catalysts can be made. Bearing in mind the high catalytic activity of NIPS3, we can now consider the mechanism of thiophene catalytic hydrodesulfurization. In particular, the matter in hand is about the possibility for the occurrence of the HDS reaction according to the so-called \"intercalation mechanism\" [21-23]. In this case, however, we do not consider a possible intercalation of promoting ions (Ni, Co) in MoS2, which, according to EXAFS data, is difficult to realize in the studied catalytic systems [24,25]. The bulk NIPS3 compound has a pronounced capacity to form various intercalation compounds [6]. Such properties are also represen- tative of transition metal sulfides which are bearers of catalytic activity (e.g. MoS2 [26] ). The intercalation mechanism can relate the NIPS3 activity to the catalytically active sulfides which are formed in the NiMo/AI203 and CoMo/A1203 catalysts under operating condi- tions. Regarding the discussion in the literature about the mechanism of thiophene hydrode- sulfurization, we would like to stress the following. (i) According to the so-called \"Solid State Model\", thiophene HDS can be represented as a many electron redox process [3]: C4H4S + [7 + 2H+ +4e- \"-) C4H6 q-S2 2H2 --' 4H + + 4e S2 +2H+~[]+H2S, where [] is a S2 vacancy in the sulfide lattice. Some results in the literature [27] indicate a close relationship between the density of S2 vacancies and catalytic activity. (ii) A key feature in the HDS mechanism is hydrogen activation. In our opinion this point has not been satisfactorily explained in the literature. According to the \"Remote Control Mechanism\" [2], hydrogen, intercalated in MoS2, takes part in the reaction. Other authors [28] presumed hydrogen intercalation in MoS2 as well. Experimental data [ 29,30] show that hydrogen occupies sites in the van der Waals gap of MoS2 crystals. In aqueous solution the intercalated hydrogen can attain a H~+5 [MoS2]- stoichiometry [26]. (iii) Concerning the structure of the active phase of HDS catalysts, many authors [2- 4,28] emphasize the importance of the \"edge sites\", that is the sites exposed at the edge of the stacking layers in MoS2 crystals. Novel studies [28] confirmed the importance of those sites for thiophene hydrodesulfurization over CoMo/A1203. According to Topsoe and Topsoe [29] the promoter effect of the cobalt on MoS2 is not due to separate Co9S8 crystallites but to cobalt ions in contact with MoS2 ( \"Co-Mo-S phase\" ). In this case the promoter atoms are located at the edge of MoS2 and the catalytic properties of the Co(Ni) edge atoms are strongly influenced by the MoS2 \"support\" [4,29]. The high dispersion [ 31,32 ] and defectiveness of the MoS2 phase is related to the high catalytic activity owing to a relative increase in number of the \"edge sites\". Based on the above-mentioned results from the literature and on the present study, we propose a mechanism of thiophene hydrodesulfurization over NIPS3 (Fig. 5). Dissociation of dihydrogen occurs after adsorption on edge nickel atoms at the entrance of the van der Waals gap. Hydrogen activation takes place through intercalation in MoS2, A.

Mechanism of thiophene hydrodesulfurization over NIPS3. that is by proton permeation in the van der Waals gap and by stabilizing the electron charge in the 2p-band of sulfur [26,30]: H+ [MoS2] ~H+ [MoS2] - The protonized hydrogen atom possesses high mobility and reactivity and interacts with Sz to give H2S. The highly mobile electron in the 2p-band interacts with the adsorbed thiophene molecule and activates it by occupation of antibonding levels. Further, upon interaction with protons, the thiophene species is decomposed. Intercalation-deintercalation is a redox process which creates mobile electrons and active protons that favour the occur- rence of the complex multielectronic HDS process. There is a unique possibility for efficient use in the catalytic process of \"localized\" and \"collectivized\" states in the sulfide lattice. The diagram shown in Fig. 5 applies also to the HDS process over the CoMo/A1203 and NiMo/A1203 catalysts. Hydrogen intercalates in MoS2 which, according to the concept of the Co-Mo-S and Ni-Mo-S phases [4], contains Co2+ or Ni2+ ions at edge sites. This diagram unifies the HDS mechanism for the three NiPS2/A1203, NiMo/A1203 and CoMo/ AI203 systems. The mechanism discussed above is related to transition metal sulfides whose structure enables the formation of intercalation compounds, like: MoS2, WSz, ReS2 (layered structure), PtS (cooperite structure), PdS, PdS2 (layers), CrzS3 (NiAs structure), TiS2, PtS2 (CdI2 structure), etc. Reference data on the HDS activity of transition metal sulfides of various structure show the following tendency [ 32-34]: LI04 A.

Likely, the facilitated electron transfer in the crystal lattice is a favourable factor in this case. The hydrogenating ability of the investigated catalytic systems can also be interpreted by the presence of active intercalated hydrogen. The edge sites are suitable for alkene adsorption during hydrogenation or isomerization. Compared to the activity in HDS, transition metal sulfides have shown similar behaviour in butene hydrogenation [32]. Sulfides having metallic character also exhibit high catalytic activity, followed by sulfides that possess intercalating properties: PtS (PtS2), WS2, ReS2, MoS2 and PdS.

        "dc:description": "NiPS3 exhibits a high catalytic activity in thiophene hydrodesulfurization, as well as a hydrogenation and isomerization activity. The promoting effect of phosphorus on nickel-molybdenum hydrodesul-furization catalysts can be explained by the formation of highly dispersed NiPS3 under the reaction conditions. The mechanism of thiophene hydrodesulfurization over NiPS3 is discussed in relation to the pronounced ability of that substance to form intercalation compounds. A key step of the mechanism is the activation of hydrogen by intercalation in the van der Waals gap.",
