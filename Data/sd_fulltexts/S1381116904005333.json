Graphical abstract Liquid phase esterification of phenylacetic acid with phenol and substituted phenols has been investigated over montmorillonite clay exchanged with H+ – Al3+ – and aluminium polyhydroxy oligomer cations. Among the catalysts studied, Al3+—montmorillonite dried at 100°C showed 67% conversion, while the same catalyst dried at 200°C showed reduced conversion of 36%. Al3+—montmorillonite dried at 400°C and montmorillonite exchanged with aluminium polyhydroxy oligomer cations dried at 100°C and calcined at 500°C failed to bring about the reaction. Effects of mole ratio of reactants, reaction period and catalyst amount on yield of the ester and catalyst regeneration are also investigated. Esterification of phenylacetic acid with phenol, cresols, nitrophenols and resorcinol has been carried out in the presence of montmorillonite clay exchanged with H+-ions, Al3+-ions and polyhydroxy oligomer cations of Al. Na+-montmorillonite (raw clay) was inactive, H+- and Al3+-montmorillonites, dried at 100°C, showed 52 and 67% conversions to ester, respectively, upon refluxing the phenylacetic acid (20mmol) and p-cresol (40mmol) for 6h. While Al3+-montmorillonite dried at 200°C showed a conversion of 36% the same catalyst when dried at 400°C showed no conversion. Montmorillonite exchanged with aluminium polyhydroxy oligomers dried at 100°C and calcined at 500°C to get pillared clay (d 001=17.5Å) failed to bring about the esterification. Effect of concentration of reactants, amount of catalyst and the reaction time on the yield of p-cresyl phenylacetate has been investigated. The esterification of phenylacetic acid with phenol and substituted phenols like m-cresol, o-cresol, p-nitro phenol and o-nitro phenol showed reduced yield due to steric factors. The activity of the clay catalyst after regeneration has also been studied. Keywords Al3+-montmorillonite Esterification p-Cresyl phenylacetate Regeneration of catalyst 1 Introduction Conventional Brønsted acids such as H2SO4, HF and HCl have many drawbacks when used as catalysts. These include harmful and high corrosive nature, difficulty in handling and work up procedure and their disposal. In order to overcome these drawbacks, several environmentally benign heterogeneous solid acid catalysts such as zeolites [1], metal oxides [2] and clays [3] are in usage. In particular, the clay catalysts have received considerable attention in different organic syntheses because of their environmental compatibility, low cost, high selectivity, reusability and operational simplicity. Among smectite clays, montmorillonite, in natural and exchanged forms, possesses both Lewis and Brønsted acidity that enables it to function as an efficient catalyst in organic transformations with excellent product-, regio- and stereo-selectivity [4]. Smectite clays and their derivatives show catalytic activity in esterification reaction of alkenes and carboxylic acids [5]. Aluminium-exchanged montmorillonite clays have been found to be very effective acid catalysts for reactions such as dimerisation of ethylene oxide to dioxygen heterocycles [6], for α,ω-dicarboxylic acids to cyclic anhydrides [7] and ether synthesis [8]. Organic esters are very important class of chemicals having applications in the production of cosmetics, perfumes, flavors, pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, solvents and intermediates. Varieties of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed to synthesize industrially important esters. Zeolites in different forms have been studied in esterification reactions such as reactions between simple alcohols and carboxylic acids [9], amyl alcohol and acetic acid [10] and oleic acid and oleyl alcohol in the formation of jojoba oil analog [11]. Filtrol-24, Amberlyst-15, sulfated zirconia and heteropolyacids have been used as catalysts in the synthesis of phenethyl acetate and cyclohexyl acetate [12]. Lipase has also been used as a catalyst in the synthesis of esters of cresols, but here the reaction times are very high [13]. However, to our knowledge no systematic study has been reported on the synthesis of the esters of phenylacetic acid using montmorillonite clay catalyst. In the present work an attempt is made to investigate the esterification reaction of phenylacetic acid with different substituted phenols using Al3+-montmorillonite. The p-cresyl phenylacetates have many industrial applications in perfumes such as lily, narcissus, hyacinth, and jasmine and in floral soaps [14]. 2 Experimental 2.1 Clay materials The clay mineral used in this work is a smectite rich white montmorillonite GK-129 (Na-GK, provided by Ceramic Technological Institute, Bangalore, India). The clay fraction containing less than 2μm was used for the study. The composition of the white montmorillonite was found by XRF to be 67.2% SiO2, 15.2% Al2O3, 1.9% Fe2O3, 3.2% MgO, 1.92% CaO, 2.58% Na2O, 0.09% K2O and LOI 7.91% with cation exchange capacity of 0.8mequiv./gclay. 2.2 Catalyst preparation and characterisation The montmorillonite clay was subjected to exchange by stirring overnight, 5g of clay sample separately with 0.5M (200mL) solutions of aluminium chloride (pH 3.5) and hydrochloric acid (pH 0.88), to get Al3+and H+-montmorillonite clay catalysts. The clay was then centrifuged and washed with distilled water repeatedly until the washings showed negative test for chloride ions. The clay sample was then dried at 100°C for 2h and ground to pass through a mesh size 100. The exchangeable Al3+ was estimated following the procedure adopted by Selvaraj et al. [15] and was found to be equivalent to cation exchange capacity. The preparative procedure for pillared clay is described elsewhere [15]. The catalyst was activated at 100°C for 30min prior to the study of its catalytic activity. The XRD patterns of the clay samples were recorded on Siemens D5005 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source between 2θ values 3° and 45°. Thermal analysis of clay samples was carried out using Polymer Laboratory make STA 1500 thermogravimetric analyzer between the temperature range of 30–750°C at heating rate of 15°Cmin−1. BET surface area of clay samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption method at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Quantachrome NOVA 1000 surface area analyzer. Prior to the analysis, the clay samples were degassed for 2h at 100°C. 2.3 Catalytic study The liquid phase esterification reaction of phenylacetic acid with phenol and substituted phenols was carried out in 100mL round-bottom flask fitted with Dean-Stark trap for water removal and a reflux condenser. Test reactions were conducted by refluxing 20mmol of phenylacetic acid, 40mmol of p-cresol and 2g of different catalysts using 30mL of toluene as a solvent for different time intervals (Table 1 ). After the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration. The filtrate was washed with 5% sodium hydroxide solution in a separating funnel to remove unreacted starting compounds. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The product was extracted with diethyl ether and checked by TLC and melting point and characterised using IR (Nicolet AVATAR 320 FT-IR) and 1H NMR (Brüker-AMX 400) spectra. The effect of reaction time, mole ratio of reactants and amount of catalyst on yield of the ester was also investigated. Further, esterification of phenylacetic acid was carried out with m- and o-cresols, resorcinol, phenol and p- and o-nitro phenols. 2.4 Catalyst regeneration The clay was separated from the reaction mixture by filtration, dried to evaporate the organic solvent and washed two times with distilled water. The resulting clay was dried at 100°C for 1h, ground to a fine powder and used again to study its activity for the esterification reaction. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of material Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of montmorillonite exchanged with both simple aluminium cations and polyhydroxy oligomer cations of aluminium. The raw montmorillonite clay shows basal spacing equal to 14.7Å (Fig. 1a) and the Al3+-montmorillonite dried at 100 and 200°C showed a similar XRD pattern with basal spacing equal to 15.5Å (Fig. 1b). The variation in basal spacing of Al3+-montmorillonite is due to replacement of cations such as Na+ in interlayer of clay by aqua ions of aluminium. The same Al3+-montmorillonite calcined at 400°C (Fig. 1c) showed a collapse of c-axis characteristic of smectites. Montmorillonite clay pillared with aluminium hydroxy oligomers (Fig. 1d) showed characteristic intense peak, corresponding to a basal spacing of 17.5Å. TGA plots for montmorillonite exchanged with both simple and polyhydroxy oligomer cations of aluminium are presented in Fig. 2 . The TGA plot of Al3+-montmorillonite (Fig. 2a) shows maximum weight loss below 200°C and reasonable loss between 200 and 400°C and the weight remained almost constant on further thermal treatment. Montmorillonite clay exchanged with polyhydroxy oligomer cations of aluminium (Fig. 2b) shows gradual weight loss till 650°C and the weight remained almost constant on further thermal treatment. Similar observations have been made by Occelli et al. [16]. The TGA observation shows that the hydrated water molecule is loosely coordinated in Al3+-montmorillonite and strongly coordinated in pillared material. Fig. 3 shows the adsorption–desorption curves of nitrogen gas at liquid nitrogen temperature for aluminium pillared clay catalyst. The hysteresis loop shown by pillared clay belongs to H3 type under the IUPAC classification indicating slit shaped pores [17]. The surface area of pillared clay catalyst was found to be 201m2 g−1. 3.2 Effect of different catalysts on esterification Table 1 gives the effect of different catalysts on the esterification of phenylacetic acid with p-cresol (1:2) using 2g of each catalyst. Raw montmorillonite in the Na+-form failed to catalyse the esterification reaction even after refluxing for 16h. This may be due to low electronegativity of Na+-ions to polarize the water molecules to donate proton. H+-montmorillonite is observed to be active showing a yield of 52% after refluxing for 12h. Al3+-montmorillonite dried at 100°C showed a yield of 67% after refluxing for 6h whereas the same clay dried at 200°C showed a reduced yield of 36% and a negligible yield when calcined at 400°C even after refluxing for 12h. The activity of Al3+-montmorillonite is due to the presence of highly electronegative and polar Al3+-ions, which generates Brønsted acidity [18]. Montmorillonite pillared with aluminium hydroxy oligomers dried at 100°C and the same clay calcined at 500°C to form oxide pillars did not show any activity even after refluxing for 12h. The mechanism of esterification is shown in Scheme 1 . Esterification reaction between carboxylic acid and alcohol is catalysed by Brønsted acids through the formation of conjugated acid ion i.e., oxonium ion (2) as given in Scheme 1. Addition of alcohol to the oxonium ion forms an intermediate adduct (3) which on loss of proton and water leads to formation of ester (4). The Brønsted acid site required for esterification is available from the dissociation of water molecule coordinated to the interlamellar metal ion (Scheme 2 ). Al3+-montmorillonite possesses hydration sphere that provides strong Brønsted acid site by dissociation of water molecule (Scheme 2) at the interlayer [19]. The loss of hydration sphere on calcining at 200 and 400°C (Scheme 3 ) makes the clay ineffective. Hence it is not surprising that Al3+-montmorillonite loses its ability to catalyse esterification after removal of water on drying at high temperature (Table 1). The inactivity of clays exchanged with aluminium hydroxy oligomers dried at 100°C for esterification reaction may be due to nonavailability of proton dissociated from the strongly coordinated hydration sphere. Also the failure of the calcined pillared clay to catalyse the esterification may be attributed to the conversion of Brønsted acid sites in to Lewis ones [16]. 3.3 Effect of molar ratio on esterification Table 2 gives the effect of molar ratio of phenylacetic acid to p-cresol on yield of the ester. The ratio of concentration of phenylacetic acid to p-cresol was varied between 20 and 80mmol to get 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 4:1, 3:1 and 2:1 molar ratios, respectively. The reactions were carried out for 6h in the presence of 2g of Al3+-montmorillonite catalyst. The yield of the ester increased with increase in the concentration of p-cresol and reached a maximum of 74% when phenylacetic acid to p-cresol ratio was 1:4. Similarly the yield of the ester increased with increase in the concentration of phenylacetic acid and reached a maximum of 77% when phenylacetic acid to p-cresol ratio was 3:1. However the slight increase in the yield of ester with increase in the concentration of phenylacetic acid or p-cresol can be attributed to shifting of equilibrium towards ester formation. The higher yield of the ester at higher concentrations of phenylacetic acid shows that the acid has more influence on the reaction. 3.4 Effect of catalyst amount on esterification Fig. 4 gives the effect of varying the amount of Al3+-montmorillonite catalyst on the yield of ester. The amount of Al3+-montmorillonite catalyst was increased from 0.5 to 3g. It was observed that the yield of ester increased with increase in catalyst amount and was maximum when 2.5g of the catalyst was used. The increase in the yield of the ester with the catalyst amount is apparently due to increase in the acid sites available for esterification reaction. The yield of the ester was found to decrease with further increase in the catalyst amount from 2.5 to 3g. This is attributed to the increase in adsorption of desired product on the excess active sites perhaps resulting in the formation of unwanted byproducts. 3.5 Effect of reaction time on esterification Fig. 5 gives the effect of reaction time on the ester yield for 20mmol of phenylacetic acid, 80mmol of p-cresol and 2g of Al3+-montmorillonite. The yield of the ester increased with increase in reaction time from 2 to 12h and there was no considerable increase in the yield of the ester when the reaction time was 18h. The reaction was found to follow second order rate equation (Table 3 ). Rate = 8.14 × 10 − 7 L mo l − 1 s − 1 [ phenylacetic acid ] [ p -cresol ] 3.6 Esterification of phenylacetic acid with different substituted phenols Table 4 gives the esterification of phenylacetic acid with various substituted phenols using 2g of clay catalyst. Among the cresols, p-cresol showed the highest yield whereas the ortho isomer showed negligible conversion possibly due to steric factors. Looking at the results of esterification with nitrophenols, it is clear that the nitro group has negative effect on the rate of reaction because, its electron withdrawing property reduces the nucleophilic character of phenol. It is not clear why resorcinol does not undergo esterification. However, it is quite likely that it gets protonated and hence rendered less nucleophilic. The activity of regenerated clay catalyst was also investigated after washing the spent catalyst with distilled water and drying it at 100°C. The yield of the ester per unit weight of the regenerated catalyst was found to be nearly the same as that obtained using fresh catalyst. The results remained essentially unchanged even after regenerating the clay catalyst five times. 4 Conclusion Al3+-montmorillonite is found to be active in bringing about the synthesis of phenylacetates, which have applications in the perfume industry. Interlamellar water attached to aluminium ions provides strong Brønsted acid sites to catalyse the esterification. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the catalyst loses its activity upon dehydration, which converts the Brønsted acid sites to Lewis ones and supports the mechanism proposed. The method suggested here is superior to the conventional procedures that make use of concentrated H2SO4 in respect of selectivity, as well as the ecofriendly and reusable nature of the catalyst. The results indicate that less acidic phenols with no substituent in the ortho position give good yields. Mere washing of the spent catalyst with distilled water regenerates the acid sites required for esterification.
