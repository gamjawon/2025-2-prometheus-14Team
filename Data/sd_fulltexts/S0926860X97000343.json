The method is based on the surface reaction taking place between tin tetraethyl and unreduced platinum or adsorbed oxygen. The formation of ethylene in the above reaction indicates that supported platinum catalyst contains either unreduced platinum or adsorbed oxygen. Keywords: Pt/A1203 catalyst; Re-reduction; Tin tetraethyl; Surface reactions I. Introduction Supported platinum catalysts are widely used in different fields of organic chemistry [ 1 ]. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts depends on the mode of re-reduction of the catalysts prior to their use [2]. The extent of re-reduction is strongly influenced by its temperature and duration. We consider that during the re- reduction process the reduction of ionic forms of platinum and the removal of chemisorbed forms of oxygen is the main surface reaction. It is worth mentioning that no convenient method is known to determine the efficiency of the re-reduction process. As far as the conditions for re-reduction are often chosen by subjective * Corresponding author.

Pll S0926-860X(97)00034-3 L2 J.L MargiO~alvi et aL /Applied Catalys& A: General 154 (1997) L1-L6 factors, there is no doubt that full reduction of platinum has not always been achieved. It is not excluded either that unusual activity and selectivity data can be attributed to the uncertainties related to the extent of re-reduction of platinum. The oxidation state of platinum in supported Pt catalysts can be determined by sophisticated spectroscopic techniques [3-5], however, none of the above methods can be routinely used to determine whether or not the platinum is fully reduced. In this contribution a new method is described to determine the efficiency of re- reduction of different supported platinum catalysts. The method is based on a new surface reaction taking place between Sn(C2Hs)4 and unreduced forms of Pt or adsorbed oxygen. 2. Surface chemistry The reaction of tin tetraalkyls with hydrogen adsorbed on transition metals is widely used to prepare supported bimetallic catalysts with metal-metal interaction or to obtain anchored organometallic moieties on transition metals [6--9]. It has been shown that the introduction of tin tetraethyl into Pt takes place in a two step anchoring process [6,7]: xPtHa + Sn(C2Hs)4 ~ Ptx-Sn(C2Hs)(4_x) + xC2H6 (1) Ptx-Sn(C2H5)(a_x) + y/2H2 ~ Ptx-Sn + (4 -x)C2H6 (2) In reaction (1) the presence of adsorbed hydrogen is the driving force to obtain the anchored organometallic complex (I). The exclusive formation of saturated hydrocarbons in reaction (1) indicates that the tin anchoring reaction is selective. Upon using reactions (1) and (2) catalysts with Sn-Pt interactions can be prepared. The amount of tin anchored depends on the size of the alkyl group and the stoichiometry of reaction (1). The latter was strongly influenced by the metal content and could be controlled by both the duration and the temperature of surface reaction (1) and the concentration of Sn(CzHs)4. In this paper we should like to demonstrate that the presence of either unreduced platinum or adsorbed oxygen strongly alters the above reaction scheme. In the absence of oxygen and after complete reduction of platinum the formation of ethylene is almost negligible, however in the presence of either unreduced forms of platinum or adsorbed oxygen the amount of ethylene formed increases. We propose that in the presence of adsorbed oxygen over platinum the following surface reaction can take place: PtOz -]- zSn(C2Hs)4 ---+ Pt-[Sn(CzHs)z]z + 2zCzH4 + zH20 (3) The above reaction, i.e. exclusive formation of ethylene, was evidenced if PtO2 was treated with Sn(C2Hs)4 in benzene solvent at 50. Similar reaction can also take place in the presence of unreduced forms of platinum in supported catalysts. J.L Margitfalvi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) LI-L6 L3 The formation of ethylene from tin tetraethyl indicates that the tin organic compound is involved in an oxidation-reduction type reaction. It should also be mentioned that tin tetra-alkyls are good reducing agents [ 10]. Consequently, the formation of ethylene in reaction (3) can be considered as an evidence for the presence of unreduced platinum or adsorbed oxygen and surface reaction (3) can be used for qualitative characterization of the state of supported platinum catalysts prior to its use. 3. Experimental Different supported platinum catalysts (Pt load: 0.3-5.0 wt%, dispersion (H/ Pt)=0.25-0.90) were used. The catalysts were re-reduced in a hydrogen atmo- sphere at different temperatures and cooled down to room temperature in pure hydrogen. The reaction of Sn(C2Hs)4 leading to the formation of ethane and ethylene was investigated in an argon atmosphere at 50 in deoxygenated solvents (10 cm3) using a 75 cm3 stirred glass reactor, the amount of catalyst was 1 g. The solvents (benzene, n-hexane and toluene) did not alter the character of reactions (1) and (3). The reaction products were determined by GC analysis. This reproducibility of the kinetic curves of the C2H6 and C2H4 formation was within 5%. No attempt was done to find the optimum conditions or the exact stoichio- metry of surface reactions (1) and (3). Further details of experimental conditions are given in figure captions. 4. Results and discussion The results obtained upon variation of the conditions of the re-reduction of a Pt/ A1203 catalyst (Pt content--5 wt%, H/Pt=0.25) are given in Fig. I(A) and (B). As emerges from these results the formation of ethylene is always observed if the temperature of re-reduction is low or the duration of re-reduction is short. However, no C2H4 formation was observed up to 120 min if the re-reduction was complete. The above catalyst required 2 h treatment in a pure hydrogen atmosphere at 400 to achieve complete re-reduction. Similar results were observed upon using a 0.5 wt% Pt/A1203 catalysts (H/Pt=0.56), however, the optimum condition was slightly different (500 and 2 h). Silica supported Pt catalysts required lower temperature and shorter time for complete re-reduction. The results given in Fig. 2 show that the re-reduction of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst at 300 is complete after 1 h treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere, however, 30 min is not sufficient for full re-reduction of platinum. The above results indicate that both the temperature and the duration of re-reduction are very important experimental variables to obtain fully reduced platinum catalysts. L4 J.L.

Margitfalvi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) L1-L6 ethylene was also observed if the platinum catalyst after its re-reduction was contacted with oxygen at room temperature. The method is sensitive: the addition of 1 cm3 oxygen into the gas phase above the solvent resulted in 30% decrease in the initial rate of surface reaction (1) and after 90 min of reaction time 7% of the formed C2 hydrocarbons was ethylene. These results indicate that the new method described is simple and sensitive. Further studies are in progress to optimize reaction conditions for both reactions (1) and (3). Quantitative information about the extent of reduction of different supported platinum catalysts can be expected if the exact stoichiometry of reactions (1) and (3) is determined for each catalyst.
