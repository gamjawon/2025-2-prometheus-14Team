Photocatalytic oxidation has been confirmed as a promising manner to control and treat low-concentration NO, during which the generation of hazardous intermediate NO2 is unavoidable, causing more severe health concerns and environmental pollution issues than NO itself. In this research, the photocatalytic removal of NO was studied over novel Bi4O5I2/CuFe2O4 (BCF) binary composites that were constructed by a straightforward solvothermal route. CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and Bi4O5I2 nanosheets were coexisted in composites and merged into heterojunction structures with compatible morphologies. Under visible light, these resultant composites exhibited reinforced photocatalytic NO removal efficiency in comparison to bare components. Specifically, the best sample BCF3, defined as the composite with the mass percent of CuFe2O4 to Bi4O5I2 as 3%, presented the toxic intermediate NO2 as 21 ppb (part per billion) and the largest photocatalytic NO removal of 44% that referred to the ratio of removal to initial concentration of NO. NO removal and NO2 generation of BCF3 improved 1.5 times and reduced by half in only 5 min compared to that of pristine Bi4O5I2, which could be attributed to the strengthened visible light harvesting, efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers through intimate interfaces, and the availability of sufficient reactive radicals. Through entrapping experiments and band structure estimation, a Z-scheme model was put forward for the photocatalysis mechanism of these robust n-p heterojunction composites.

Introduction Acid rain, photochemical smog, ozone depletion, and regional suspended solid particles are several environmental issues generally caused by nitric oxide (NO), a typical detrimental air pollution gas [1–3]. Basically, wet absorption and thermal catalytic reduction are two common methods to minimize NO emissions that normally feature with high concentrations and flows [4]. Alternatively, the photocatalytic technology is particularly effective for low concentrations and flows of NO by using solar energy under mild conditions [5]. During photocatalytic processes, NO2 is inevitably produced by oxidants and further induces undesirable harms to humans because of its high toxicity relative to NO [6,7]. As a result, it is imperative to design and develop effective photocatalytic systems possessing strengthened NO removal together with the inhibition of NO2 production [8–10]. In general, bismuth oxyhalides have unique lamellar morphologies, appropriate band structures, and excellent electrical and optical properties, enabling them to be potentially applied in fields such as healing drugs, pigments, catalysts, and gas sensors [11]. However, the drawback of rapid recomplexation of generated carriers continues to hinder their applications in practical environmental pollution control [12]. Recent reports have proven that the oxygen-rich counterparts outperform bismuth oxyhalides in terms of photocatalytic performance, owing to the reinforced visible-light absorption and improved separation efficiencies of charge carriers [13]. Among oxygen-rich bismuth oxyiodide, Bi4O5I2 has gained the greatest attention and been explored in photocatalytic evaluations because of its well-maintained lamellar structure and relatively positive valence band (VB) position [14]. While, the photocatalytic activity of pristine Bi4O5I2 is still far from adequate. Therefore, more efforts are required to be implemented to combat this problem, such as the morphological control [15,16], heterojunctions construction with other semiconductors [14,17], carbonaceous materials decoration [18,19], and ions doping [20,21]. As per the previous studies, the heterojunction construction has been considered an efficient alternative method to improve photocatalytic performance because the combination of two semiconductors with different Fermi levels (Ef ) tends to broaden the optical absorption range and leads to charge spatial redistribution at interface due to the resultant built-in electric field [22]. A typical type-II model mechanism benefits carriers redistribution on different components, and these carriers usually possess weakened redox potentials, which can be effectively ameliorated by establishing a Z-scheme model in both phases with suitable band structures [23], ensuring the stronger redox capability of residual carriers. As a metal oxide with an inverse spinel structure, copper ferrate (CuFe2O4) has piqued the extensive interests in many fields, such as gas sensors, CO2 decomposition, NOx removal [24], negative electrodes of lithium-ion batteries, and hydrogen production [25]. It has been discovered to be a promising photocatalyst due to the easy production of carriers by the narrow band gap (∼2.0 eV), formation of abundant reactive species by both oxidation states (Cu2+/Cu+), as well as the magnetic property [26]. Recently, layered CuFe2O4-based bismuth oxyhalide heterojunctions were typically fabricated for efficient H2 evolution under visible light [27] and novel CuFe2O4/Bi12O17Cl2 p-n heterojunctions were also constructed for photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A [28]. Therefore, it is desirable to combine Bi4O5I2 with the component CuFe2O4 to create composites with well-matched band structures and accordingly enhanced photocatalytic performance during NO removal processes. To the best of our knowledge, few publications have demonstrated the photocatalytic NO elimination over Bi4O5I2-based systems [29,30]. Herein, for the first time Bi4O5I2/CuFe2O4 n-p heterojunction composites were fabricated in a facile manner and systematically characterized by various analyses for photocatalytic NO removal. These composites were subjected to photocatalytic NO removal under visible light and a structure-effect relationship was established. The improved photocatalytic performance was explored through analyzing physiochemical properties and a possible photocatalysis mechanism was finally proposed. This work highlights a feasible strategy for NO2-inhibited NO removal by Bi4O5I2/CuFe2O4 heterojunctions and provides insights into the rational design of hetero-structured photocatalysts towards deep oxidation of NO, avoiding the NO2 intermediate generation. Materials and methods Materials syntheses All reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. without further purification. Pristine CuFe2O4 was prepared by a sol-gel calcination route based on the citrate complex [31]. Composites Bi4O5I2/CuFe2O4 were prepared through a following protocol. Typically, 6 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 12 mmol KI in 140 mL ethylene glycol were mechanically stirred until they were entirely dissolved. Afterward, a 7.8 mL NaOH aqueous solution with a concentration of 2 M was gently added dropwise. CuFe2O4 with variable dosages was added to the reaction system and stirred for 100 min before being placed into the autoclave and kept in a drying oven at 150 °C for 12 h. Following that, the precipitate was rinsed three times with water and ethanol for each before drying overnight at 60 °C. As-synthesized samples were designated as BCF1, BCF3, and BCF5, according to the mass percent of CuFe2O4 verse theoretically produced Bi4O5I2. Typical characterization and analyses were put in the Supplementary Materials for brevity. Photocatalytic NO removal Photocatalytic NO removal at ppb level was tested in a reactor at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. A 500 W xenon lamp (CEL-LAX500, AuLight, China) with two cut-off filters (420∼780 nm) was mounted horizontally above the reactor as a light source. The distance from the upper surface of reactor to the lamp was fixed as 20 cm and the radiation flux of lamp was measured as 1376 mW/cm2 through a light optical power meter (CEL-NP2000, AuLight, China). 0.15 g sample was evenly coated on a glass dish with a diameter of 10 cm and the glass dish was set at center of the reactor. Moreover, the initial concentration of NO was fixed at 500 ppb. Specific operations were almost the same as in previous report [6] except for parameters described as above. To confirm the major active species in photocatalytic reactions, entrapment experiments were conducted using different scavengers. Respectively, the reagents KI (0.2 g), tert‑butanol (TBA, 0.2 mM), p-benzoquinone (PBQ, 0.2 g), or K2Cr2O7 (0.2 g) were introduced to capture holes (h +), hydroxyl radicals (·OH), superoxide radicals (·O2 −), or electrons (e −), respectively. Experimental procedure was completely consistent with the aforementioned photocatalytic process by using the composite BCF3 as a catalyst. In order to explore the structural stability and reusability of composite BCF3, repeated experiments were carried out by using a procedure similar to photocatalytic NO removal without any washing treatment for the catalyst. Results and discussion Analyses of phase composition and morphological structure The phase composition, crystallinity, and purity of samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1A . Diffraction peaks of CuFe2O4 at 18.3º, 29.9º, 35.8º, 43.7º, 53.9º, 57.8º, and 62.1º are consistent with the crystal planes (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) in the tetragonally distorted inverse spinel CuFe2O4 (PDF#34–0425) [28,32]. Diffraction peaks of Bi4O5I2 are located at 28.8º, 31.3º, 37.0º, 42.1º, 45.1º, 49.3º, and 54.4º, corresponding to crystal planes (411), (020), (404), (323), (422), (006), and (811), which are in good accordance with the pure monoclinic Bi4O5I2 phase (JCSD NO.41–2590) [33]. The characteristic peaks of composites scarcely vary when different contents of CuFe2O4 are introduced, which may be due to the low content of CuFe2O4 at small particle sizes [34]. The absence of other feature peaks in these samples confirms the high purity without the formation of other substances. More evidence for the existence of both components in heterojunctions could be confirmed by the UV–visible diffuse reflection (UV–Vis DRS) spectra associated with their optical properties and band structures [35,36], as shown in Fig. 1B. Bi4O5I2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and partial visible light with an absorption edge of around 560 nm, whereas CuFe2O4 absorbs in the entire light region because of the narrow bandgap [37]. All binary composites have UV–Vis DRS spectra that are distributed between those of Bi4O5I2 and CuFe2O4, indicating that the composites are indeed composed of two components. When compared to bare Bi4O5I2, the absorption edges of composites in the visible region gradually redshift as the CuFe2O4 content increases. Bandgap energies (Eg ) of semiconductor-based materials can usually be calculated by the formula αhν = A(hν - E g) n /2, Where α, h, ν, and A are respectively the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, optical frequency, and constant [38]. In addition, the value n depends on the nature of the electronic transfer. According to previous reports [28,39], Bi4O5I2 is of an indirect transition and CuFe2O4 is of a direct transition, so the corresponding values of n are respectively selected as 4 and 1, which can be further confirmed in Figure S1 by the method described in the Supplementary materials. From the intersection points of tangents from (αhν) 2/n verse hν curves and the X axis, the values E g of CuFe2O4 and Bi4O5I2 are approximately 1.50 and 2.35 eV in Figs. 1C and D, which are quite close to the stated values [17,40]. Similarly, values E g of composites BCF1, BCF3, and BCF5 are determined to be 2.32, 2.26, and 2.22 eV in Figure S2, revealing the gradual shrinkage of E g by the incorporation of CuFe2O4 with a narrow bandgap, which accelerates the formation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs to some extent owing to the lower bandgap and thus fosters the photocatalytic redox ability of BCF heterojunctions, which can be demonstrated by the degradation efficiency of NO in Fig. 4A. Moreover, the microstructure and morphologies of Bi4O5I2, CuFe2O4, and composite BCF3 were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. As shown in Fig. 2A , bare Bi4O5I2 exhibits 3D aggregations that consist of numerous nanosheets with a thickness of around 20 nm in Figure S3A, whereas the SEM image of CuFe2O4 in Fig. 2B manifests a substantial amount of uniform spherical nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 35 nm, as illustrated in Figures S3B and S3C. However, after combining two components, both distinctive morphologies of nanosheets marked by the red square frame and nanoparticles marked by red arrows can be identified in composite BCF3 in Fig. 2C, directly confirming the coexistence of Bi4O5I2 and CuFe2O4 in the produced composite, as expected. More notably, these CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were scattered across the Bi4O5I2 surface or intercalated into nanosheets, signifying the formation of heterojunction domains at boundaries in compatible morphologies. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) images of composite BCF3 were measured on a specific area in the SEM image. The findings validate the presence of two predicted components as composite BCF3 is found to be comprised of five elements Bi, I, Fe, O, and Cu in a uniform manner across the selected region in Fig. 2D. Moreover, through the atomic percent of relevant elements in EDS spectrum in Figure S4, the mass percent of CuFe2O4 verse Bi4O5I2 in composite BCF3 was computed as 2.7% that is quite close to the theoretical value 3%, demonstrating the reliability and rationality of such synthetic procedure. In addition, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the composite sample BCF3 in Fig. 2E indicated that interfaces consist of numerous nanosheets from Bi4O5I2 and spherical nanoparticles from CuFe2O4, as highlighted with the red circle. It is worth noting that the sample BCF3 was sonicated in ethanol for 10 min before testing so that its microstructure and morphology can be clearly observed. The diameter of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles in Fig. 2E is consistent with the size in the corresponding SEM image in Fig. 2B and the TEM image of CuFe2O4 is shown for comparison in the inset of Fig. 2E. Fig. 2F is a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of composite BCF3 portraying two distinct lattice fringes with lattice spacings of 0.31 and 0.171 nm, which correspond to crystal planes (−4–11) of Bi4O5I2 and (311) of CuFe2O4, respectively. This discovery implies that the two components coexist and are in intimate contact to form heterojunction structures, by which the migration and spatial separation of photo-generated carriers are ensured and ultimately result in effectively improved photocatalytic efficiencies. The chemical element composition and valence states of both components and the composite BCF3 were subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. In the survey spectrum in Fig. 3A , significant signals of elements Bi, O, and I and feeble signals of elements Fe and Cu, respectively, originate from Bi4O5I2 and CuFe2O4, further indicating the successful construction of binary composite with CuFe2O4 at low content. Signals at 159.1 and 164.4 eV of the high-resolution Bi 4f spectrum in Fig. 3B can be attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 orbitals in Bi4O5I2 [41]. Additionally, the I 3d spectrum in Fig. 3C includes both signals centered at 619.1 and 630.6 eV, which can be assigned to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 orbitals in Bi4O5I2 [41]. Moreover, in Fig. 3D peaks at 724.5 and 722.9 eV correspond to the typical Fe 2p1/2 orbitals and peaks located at 710.8 and 712.9 eV correspond to the Fe 2p3/2 orbitals, revealing the presence of Fe3+and Fe2+ in CuFe2O4 [40]. The peak at 719.5 eV attributes to the shake-up satellite signal, also indicating the co-existence of Fe3+and Fe2+ species. Merely two faint peaks appear at 709.2 and 723.1 eV in composite BCF3 because of the small content of CuFe2O4. Clearly, several peaks are present in CuFe2O4 in Fig. 3E: peaks at 933.25 and 953.7 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 [42], peak at 941.3 eV for Cu2+ [43], and two vibrating satellites at 943.7 and 962.2 eV for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 from the open 3d9 shell of Cu2+ [44]. Similarly, several faint signals of Cu species are observed in the composite. As shown in Fig. 3F, both peaks at 529.9 and 532.0 eV in Bi4O5I2 belong to the Bi-O bonds and hydroxyl‑containing substances on the surface [15,17], peaks at 529.8 and 531.2 eV in CuFe2O4 are attributed to oxygen in lattices and the surface hydroxyl moieties, respectively [28,45,46]. In the composite BCF3, two peaks at 529.7 and 531.3 eV correspond to the Bi-O bonds and adsorbed hydroxyl‑containing substances [15]. As to the composite BCF3, the measured atomic percentage of Cu is around 3.3% in the XPS spectra, slightly larger than the experimental value of 3%, revealing the distribution of CuFe2O4 only on the surface of Bi4O5I2. Obviously, binding energies of Bi 4f and I 3d in the composite BCF3 slightly move upfield in comparison to those in Bi4O5I2 and binding energies of Fe 2p and Cu 2p conversely shift downfield in comparison to those in CuFe2O4, implying the transfer of electrons from Bi4O5I2 to CuFe2O4. Photocatalytic NO removal Photocatalytic capabilities of the as-prepared catalyst were evaluated by the oxidation of NO under visible light in Fig. 4A, in which each reported value was the average of at least three parallel tests with relevant error bars for sake of repeatability and reproducibility. During processes, the formation of intermediate NO2 serves as a critical assessment criterion as well. As shown in Fig. 4A, the absence of a change in the NO concentration indicates the inefficiencies of bare CuFe2O4 either in dark or under visible light. Although there is no difference in removing NO for either Bi4O5I2 or BCF series in dark, the NO concentration decreases significantly in visible light, suggesting the effectively photocatalytic nature of these samples. Notably, the photocatalytic capacities of BCF series are evidently higher than that of Bi4O5I2, confirming the positive role of heterojunction structures. The composite BCF3 exhibits the optimal NO removal around 44%, which is approximately 1.25 times that of Bi4O5I2. Photocatalytic NOx removal by different samples in Figure S5A describes a similar variation trend to NO removal in Fig. 4A. In addition, the composite BCF3 can inhibit the generation of hazardous intermediate NO2 to 21 ppb that is only half that of Bi4O5I2 (40 ppb), as indicated in Fig. 4B. The NO conversion to nitrite/nitrate (NO2 −/NO3 −) species was evaluated through the recoding of FT-IR spectra of the best candidate BCF3 before and after reactions. As seen in Figure S5B, two weak signals at 1176 and 1046 cm−1 corresponding to NO2 − and NO3 − species [7] are obviously observed in the curve after reaction instead of before reaction, confirming the photocatalytic production of NO2 −/NO3 − species from NO under visible light. The comparison of reaction conditions, NOx removal, and NO2 generation of previous reports by bismuth-based photocatalysts and our system is summarized in Table S1, unveiling the comparability and superiority of our system. From the industrial and commercial application perspectives, the recyclability and structural stability of catalysts are essential features to consider [47,48]. As a result, the composite BCF3 with the best catalytic performance was typically chosen to evaluate photocatalytic NO removal for five successive cycles. As depicted in Fig. 4C, the photocatalytic outcome of NO removal can be well conserved even up to the fifth cycle, though the NO2 generation slightly increases. In addition, the similarity of XRD patterns before and after the fifth cycle identifies the good stability of crystallinity and phase composition in Fig. 4D. The above results conclude the sufficient robust nature of as-prepared composites during photocatalytic NO removal processes. The redistribution and spatial separation of charge carriers in relevant samples were investigated by electrochemical analyses and photoluminescence (PL) spectra [49]. In Fig. 4E, the transient photocurrent response of the composite BCF3 is significantly boosted compared with those of CuFe2O4 and Bi4O5I2, suggesting the accelerated migration rate of photo-generated carriers and thus the superior photocatalytic NO removal. Moreover, from the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. 4F, composite BCF3 possesses the smallest semicircular arc diameter in the Nyquist diagram, implying the smallest interfacial resistance to electronic transition and the best charge transfer among tested samples [50]. PL spectra of Bi4O5I2 and composite BCF3 were further recorded to discover the separation efficiency of charge carriers. As represented in Figure S6, the intensity of PL band of Bi4O5I2 is significantly stronger than that of composite BCF3, revealing the effective suppression of carriers recombination by the integration of CuFe2O4. In short, introducing an adequate quantity of CuFe2O4 can effectively prevent the complexation of charge carriers, prolong the electron`s lifetime, and greatly improve NO removal activity. The fundamental reason for such phenomena is mainly attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption substantiated by the color change and UV–Vis DRS findings in Fig. 1B, efficient migration and spatial separation of charge carriers in Figures 4E, 4F, and S6, and strengthened reactive species generation in following Figs. 5C and 5D through produced heterojunction structures in Fig. 2F with compatible morphologies in Fig. 2C. Overall, the favorable physiochemical properties of as-synthesized composites induce the enhancement of NO removal and suppression of NO2 formation. Nevertheless, such system requires further modifications to pursue more reinforced photocatalytic performance. Photocatalysis mechanism reckoning Reactive species quenching experiments were carried out to elucidate the predominant active species during the photocatalytic removal of NO. Herein, PBQ, KI, TBA, or K2Cr2O7 were applied as quenchers of ·O2 −, holes, ·OH, and electrons, respectively. As shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, NO removal efficiencies are inhibited in the presence of PBQ and KI by Bi4O5I2 and composite BCF3, indicating the pivotal roles of ·O2 − radicals and holes in both systems [51,52]. The key roles of ·O2 − radicals in both systems are also confirmed by the strong inhibitory effect of adding K2Cr2O7. As a matter of fact, holes in composite BCF3 do not play as significant roles as ·O2 − since there is still around 5% NO removal despite the minor disparity. Nevertheless, the addition of TBA causes a negligible effect on the catalytic behavior of Bi4O5I2, but slightly inhibits the photocatalytic ability of composite BCF3, indicating the participation of radicals ·OH in the redox reaction in composite BCF3 instead of Bi4O5I2. NO2 generation in both systems with different quenching reagents was recorded and is shown in Figure S7, illustrating the radicals ·OH facilitate the formation of NO2 instead of NO2 −/NO3 − species. To further verify the generation of active radicals ·OH and ·O2 − during the photocatalytic process, DMPO-trapped ESR spectra of both Bi4O5I2 and BCF3 were undertaken. As shown in Fig. 5C, the multiple signals of DMPO-·O2 − adducts can be observed in both systems under visible light, which is in good accordance with quenching experiments. Besides, the intensity of signals in composite BCF3 is much stronger than that in Bi4O5I2, indicating the boosted generation of radicals ·O2 − because of the sufficient electrons provided by efficient heterojunction structures. A similar phenomenon is observable for the quadruple signals of DMPO-·OH adducts in both systems. From Fig. 5D, abundant radicals ·OH in composite BCF3 may be derived from two pathways of holes and radicals ·O2 − and participate in photocatalytic NO removal reactions [53,54], as illustrated by the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The flat band potentials (Vfb ) of semiconductors can be intuitively achieved from Mott-Schottky analyses, by which band structures can be estimated to understand photocatalysis mechanisms. According to Figure S8, the Vfb of CuFe2O4 is about 0.35 V versus SCE (0.59 V versus NHE), and CuFe2O4 is a p-type semiconductor according to the negative slope of the curve of 1/2C2 versus potential [55]. Meanwhile, the valence band top (EVB ) of p-type semiconductors is approximately 0.1–0.2 V below the Vfb . Therefore, if the voltage difference between EVB and Vfb is set to 0.2 V, the EVB of CuFe2O4 is calculated as 0.39 V versus NHE, which is close to that reported [56]. Considering the value Eg , the conduction band bottom (ECB ) of CuFe2O4 is computed as −1.11 V versus NHE. Moreover, the corresponding ECB and EVB of n-type Bi4O5I2 are about −0.16 and 2.19 V versus NHE [41]. A viable photocatalysis mechanism graphically describing the generation and migration of charge carriers with subsequent redox reactions is deduced in the light of experimental and analytic results in Fig. 6 . As stated, the n-type Bi4O5I2 and p-type CuFe2O4 own the respective values Ef close to positions of conduction band (CB) and VB. The integration of both components balances values Ef by transferring electrons from Bi4O5I2 to CuFe2O4, as verified by XPS spectra. However, a type-II mode is unreasonable since electrons and holes collected on CB of Bi4O5I2 and VB of CuFe2O4 are insufficient to produce radicals ·O2 − and ·OH because of the weak redox potentials, which contrasts with entrapping experiments and ESR results [57]. Instead, a Z-scheme mode is credible to be estimated, by which electrons and holes accumulate on CB of CuFe2O4 and VB of Bi4O5I2 because of the recombination and consumption of carriers from adjacent CB of Bi4O5I2 and VB of CuFe2O4. These charge carriers with more powerful redox capacities may directly react with substrates or indirectly react with substrates through the generated radicals ·O2 − and ·OH. Accordingly, photocatalytic NO removal and selectivity for NO2 −/NO3 − species are ameliorated by the strengthened visible light absorption, the improved generation and separation of interface carriers, and the boosted formation of reactive species by these heterojunction structures with compatible morphologies. These robust BCF series ought to be subjected to further modifications for the sake of excellent physiochemical properties and photocatalytic output of NO removal considering atmospheric environmental protection. Conclusion In conclusion, for the first time p-type CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were successfully anchored on surface of n-type Bi4O5I2 nanosheets with the uniform dispersion to form n-p heterojunction composites. These composites owned enhanced visible-light harvesting capability, improved migration and segregation efficiency of charge carriers, and bolstered formation of plentiful active species, giving rise to the enhanced photocatalytic activity for NO removal with substantially low intermediate NO2 generation. Among them, the sample BCF3 optimized the catalytic NO removal (44%) and NO2 inhibition (21 ppb) within 15 min and the degradation efficiency was retained well after five cycles. In addition, a possible Z-scheme photocatalysis mechanism was speculated according to entrapping experiments and band structures estimation.

        "dc:description": "Photocatalytic oxidation has been confirmed as a promising manner to control and treat low-concentration NO, during which the generation of hazardous intermediate NO2 is unavoidable, causing more severe health concerns and environmental pollution issues than NO itself. In this research, the photocatalytic removal of NO was studied over novel Bi4O5I2/CuFe2O4 (BCF) binary composites that were constructed by a straightforward solvothermal route. CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and Bi4O5I2 nanosheets were coexisted in composites and merged into heterojunction structures with compatible morphologies. Under visible light, these resultant composites exhibited reinforced photocatalytic NO removal efficiency in comparison to bare components. Specifically, the best sample BCF3, defined as the composite with the mass percent of CuFe2O4 to Bi4O5I2 as 3%, presented the toxic intermediate NO2 as 21 ppb (part per billion) and the largest photocatalytic NO removal of 44% that referred to the ratio of removal to initial concentration of NO. NO removal and NO2 generation of BCF3 improved 1.5 times and reduced by half in only 5 min compared to that of pristine Bi4O5I2, which could be attributed to the strengthened visible light harvesting, efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers through intimate interfaces, and the availability of sufficient reactive radicals. Through entrapping experiments and band structure estimation, a Z-scheme model was put forward for the photocatalysis mechanism of these robust n-p heterojunction composites.",
