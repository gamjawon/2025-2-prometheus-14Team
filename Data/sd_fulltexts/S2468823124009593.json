The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is an important chemical process for hydrogen production and purification. The Ni-based catalyst is considered as a potential substitute for Fe and Cu-based catalysts. However, the origin of support-dependent catalytic behavior of WGS reaction over supported Ni catalysts was not well understood. Herein, a series of Ni-based catalysts with the reducible and irreducible oxides as supports were synthesized and evaluated in the WGS reaction. The catalytic activity followed the sequence: Ni/CeO2 >Ni/ZrO2 >Ni/Al2O3 >Ni/TiO2 >Ni/SiO2. WGS reaction over Ni-based catalysts proceeded via redox mechanism with the CO adsorption/activation as the rate-determining step. Combined with the ex/in-situ characterizations, it was concluded that the strength of support-dependent electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) was identified as the performance descriptor for WGS reaction. The stronger EMSI for Ni/CeO2 accelerated the surface electron enrichment of Ni nanoparticles which strengthened CO adsorption and promoted CO oxidation with the interfacial oxygen species.

Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced from stream reforming of hydrocarbons and coal gasification [3]. However, the H2-rich reforming gas derived from fossil fuels contains impurities such as CO, CO2 and N2, which need to be further purified. The water-gas shift reaction (WGS, CO + H2O ↔ CO2 + H2, ΔH o = −41.2 kJ·mol-1) is an indispensable process for hydrogen production and CO removal for industrial applications [4]. In consideration of reversibility and exothermicity, the industrial WGS process is firstly conducted at high-temperature (HT, 350–450 °C) and then followed by a low-temperature operation (LT, 190–250 °C). Such a two-stage process could overcome the low thermodynamic equilibrium at high temperatures and slow kinetics at low temperatures. However, the two-stage WGS reactor cannot meet the requirements of portable and mobile small-scale fuel processor due to the large volume and high cost, which cast a shadow for industrial applications. Recently, single-stage WGS reaction at medium temperature (MT) has attracted widespread attention from the industrial and academic communities due to fast kinetics and high thermodynamic equilibrium [5]. The MT-WGS reaction has been widely explored over Co [6,7], Ni [8–11] and Pt-based catalysts [5], among which the Ni-based catalyst is one of the most promising MT-WGS catalysts owing to the excellent catalytic performance and low cost. Previous studies on the nickel-based catalysts focused on the CO/CO2 methanation and hydrocarbons/alcohol reforming reaction [12–15]. Recently, it was reported that the supported Ni catalysts with the precisely tailored structures could also efficiently catalyze the WGS reaction at medium temperature [8]. Thus, various strategies have been developed to construct the high-efficiency Ni-based catalysts via the optimization of geometric and electronic properties, including the formation of Ni-M alloys, the doping of alkali metals and the modification of supports [8–11]. By modulating the surface properties of Ni nanoparticles, the CO adsorption and H2O dissociation have been successfully enhanced which led to a significant increase in catalytic performance. Although great progress has been achieved in terms of the catalyst design and reaction mechanism study, the controllable construction of high-efficiency Ni-based catalysts is still challenging due to the structural complexity of supported Ni catalysts and lack of experimental descriptors. It is widely recognized that WGS reaction proceeds in a bifunctional manner, in which CO adsorbs on the metal sites and H2O is dissociated on the oxygen vacancies of supports or metal-support interface, followed by the catalytic CO oxidation with the active oxygen species at the metal-support interface [9,11]. Therefore, the metal-support interface plays a key role in tuning the catalytic activity and selectivity which is closely related to the intrinsic properties of active metals and supports. In recent years, some studies demonstrated that the reducibility of supports is a key performance descriptor of the supported catalysts for WGS reaction [16–19]. It is generally concluded that the reducible supports (e.g. TiO2, CeO2, ZrO2) could enhance the metal dispersion and formation of defective sites in comparison with the irreducible supports (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3), contributing to the superior catalytic performance. Nevertheless, it was also observed that the Au nanoparticles loaded on the irreducible and reducible supports with comparable particle size still exhibited a significant difference in the intrinsic activity, suggesting the complexity of support-dependent catalytic behavior [16,17]. Notably, other properties of supports except for the reducibility could also affect the reactivity, which has not been fully explained. At present, there is no consensus on the support effects. In terms of Ni-based catalysts, the nature of supports influences not only the catalytic activity but also the side reaction of methanation during WGS reaction [8]. However, the structure-activity relationship of the nickel-catalyzed water-gas shift reaction is still ambiguous. In the other hand, it has been reported that the supports could also influence the reaction pathways of WGS reaction. The redox mechanism was only realized on Pt/TiO2 while WGS reaction over Pt/CeO2 involved a combination of redox and associative pathway. The catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 catalyst modified by CeO2 was significantly enhanced with the mixed reaction mechanism [20]. In the case of Ni-based catalysts, the reaction pathways on the pristine metallic Ni surface have been widely investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting that the carboxyl and redox mechanisms are more energetically favorable [21,22]. However, it remains unclear and controversial for the supported Ni catalysts due to the structural complexity. Hence, it is very essential to systematically investigate the origin of support effects in the Ni-catalyzed WGS process. Herein, this work aims to elucidate the support effects on reaction mechanism and catalytic performance in the Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction. CeO2, TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 were selected as supports. A series of supported Ni catalysts were prepared via deposition-precipitation method and evaluated in the WGS condition. In-situ DRIFTS and TPSR were employed to clarify the reaction pathways on the different supported Ni catalysts. Furthermore, the origin of support-dependent catalytic behavior was revealed by the combination of kinetic data, surface electronic and redox properties and the dynamic behavior of surface reaction. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals (AR grade) were used as received without further purification. Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (AR, 99.9 %), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, 98 %) and NaOH (AR, 97 %) were purchased from Energy Chemical Co., Ltd. ZrO2 (monoclinic phase, ∼40 nm, 99.0 %), Al2O3 (γ phase, ∼10 nm, 99.99 %), SiO2 (∼200 m2·g-1, 7–40 nm, 99.8 %), TiO2 (rutile, ∼25 nm, 99.8 %) and urea (≥99.0 %) were purchased from Macklin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 2.2 Catalyst preparation With the exception of CeO2, other oxides were bought and used as the supports. Noteworthily, CeO2 nanorods were prepared by previous method [23]. Typically, 5 mL of 0.8 M Ce(NO3)3 and 75 mL of 6.4 M NaOH solution were mixed under vigorous stirring. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 24 h The obtained precipitates were washed with distilled water and ethanol alternatively for three times and then dried overnight at 60 °C. The catalysts of Ni nanoparticles anchored on different supports were synthesized via deposition-precipitation method. Specifically, 1 g of supports and 2 g of urea were ultrasonically dispersed in 90 mL deionized water. 10 mL of Ni(NO3)2 solution (Ni amount: 30 mg) was added into the above suspension of dispersed metal oxides. Then, the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 h at 90 °C. Subsequently, the mixed suspension was centrifuged and washed by deionized water for three times. The obtained precipitate was further dried at 70 °C for 12 h 2.3 Catalyst characterization Microstructure images of the reduced catalysts were obtained on the Hitachi HT7800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the reduced catalysts were acquired on the Rigaku Powder X-ray diffractometer with the Cu Kα radiation. The specific surface areas of Ni-based catalysts were measured by nitrogen physisorption based on the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the reduced catalysts were collected on the Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray source. The actual Ni loadings of catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Aglient 5110). H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. Before test, 50 mg of fresh catalysts was pretreated at 200 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere and cooled down to 50 °C. Then, the catalyst was reduced in the flow of 10 % H2/Ar (50 mL min-1) by a temperature-programmed procedure with a ramping rate of 10 °C·min-1. CO temperature-programmed desorption (CO-TPD) experiment was also carried out. Typically, 100 mg of catalysts was firstly reduced with the mixture of 10 % H2/Ar at 350 °C for 30 min followed by purging for 30 min in a He flow. The gas was switched to 5 % CO/Ar and stabilized for 30 min at 50 °C. Then, the excessive gaseous CO or physiosorped CO was purged by an Ar flow for 60 min. Afterwards, CO-TPD was performed at ramp rate of 10 °C min-1. The Ni dispersions of catalysts were determined by CO chemisorption. Specifically, 50 mg of catalysts was reduced at 350 °C with the 10 % H2/Ar mixture and cooled down to 40 °C in an Ar atmosphere. Then, a certain amount of CO was pulsed into reactor until the saturated adsorption. Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) was performed to monitor the dynamic behavior of reactants and products. In a typical test, the reduced catalyst was exposed to the gas mixture of CO/H2O/Ar (∼ 50 mL min-1) at 50 °C and then the catalyst bed was heated from 50 °C to 350 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min-1. The signals of H2 (m/z = 2) and CO2 (m/z = 44) were detected by mass spectroscopy (MS, Hiden Analytical HA-085–172). In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was conducted on the Nicolet IS 50 spectrometer to monitor the main intermediates during WGS reaction. Prior to measurement, the catalyst was pretreated in the 10 % H2/Ar atmosphere at 350 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, the background spectra were collected under an Ar atmosphere. Then, the reactant gases were introduced into reactor which was heated from 50 °C to 350 °C at ramp rate of 10 °C min-1. The IR spectra were collected from 50 °C to 350 °C at 50 °C intervals. Besides, the IR spectra were continuously collected to monitor the dynamic behavior of surface species at 250 °C when the gas mixture of CO/H2O/Ar was switched to H2O/Ar. 2.4 Catalytic evaluation and kinetics measurement WGS reaction over Ni-based catalysts was evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8.0 mm. Typically, 50 mg of catalysts was diluted with 250 mg of quartz sand (80–120 mesh) and then loaded into the reactor. Before measurement, the catalysts were reduced at 350 °C for 30 min in the flow of 10 % H2/Ar (50 mL min-1). The gaseous mixture, consisting of 2 % CO and ∼6 % H2O (N2 balance), was introduced into reactor with a flow rate of 50 mL min-1. The water vapor was obtained by bubbling the 2 % CO/N2 through the water reservoir at 37 °C and inlet lines heated to prevent condensation before the reactor. The data were acquired at each 25 °C interval in a steady state. The outlet concentrations of reactants and products were measured by an online gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity (TCD) and flame ionization detectors (FID). CO and CO2 were analyzed by TCD and CH4 was analyzed by FID. CO conversion (XCO ) and CH4 selectivity (SCH4 ) were calculated as follow: X co = C O inlet − C O outl et C O inlet × 100 % C O i n l e t and C O o u t l e t represent the inlet and outlet concentrations of CO, respectively. S CH 4 = C H 4 outl et C O 2 outl et + C H 4 outl et × 100 % CO2 outlet and CO4 outlet refer to the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the effluent gas, respectively. k CO = X CO × f CO 22.4 × m Ni × 1000 kCO is the specific rate of CO conversion (mmol·gNi -1·h-1). fCO is the volumetric flow rate of CO (L·h-1). m Ni is the mass of Ni in the used catalysts. The reaction orders of CO over various Ni catalysts were mainly measured at 275 °C. The H/D kinetic isotope effect was used to determine the role of H2O activation on catalytic activity of various Ni catalysts. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 WGS reaction performance The catalytic performance of WGS reaction over different Ni catalysts was evaluated and shown in Fig. 1 . The Ni/CeO2 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity with CO conversion of 85.1 % at 300 °C (Fig. 1a). By contrast, other Ni catalysts with different supports delivered lower CO conversion (< 20 %) at the same conditions, indicating the critical role of support properties. The Ni-weighted normalized reaction rates at 300 °C were further calculated and summarized in Table 1 . The Ni/CeO2 catalyst gave a remarkable CO conversion rate of 1644.35 mmol·gNi -1·h-1 at 300 °C which is several times higher than those of other supported Ni catalysts. It should be noted that Ni/ZrO2 is less active than Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/TiO2 below 300 °C. However, the catalytic activity of Ni/ZrO2 significantly increased when reaction temperature was above 300 °C. In terms of selectivity, methanation was completely suppressed for all Ni catalysts below 300 °C and the CH4 selectivity was still lower than 6 % even at 350 °C (Fig. S1). The long-term stability test demonstrated that the CO conversion of Ni/CeO2 catalyst almost remained unchanged during 50 h on steam at 300 °C, suggesting that Ni/CeO2 exhibited excellent thermal resistance and chemical stability (Fig. 1b). The kinetic data were firstly measured to investigate the effects of support on Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction. Previous studies have demonstrated that H2O activation is more difficult kinetically due to a high dissociation energy barrier [6,7,24]. Hence, the H/D kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was measured to investigate the roles of H2O activation on the catalytic performance. Four catalysts exhibited the similar H/D KIE value of ∼1.5, implying a normal secondary isotope effect (Table 1) [7]. The results demonstrated that the OH cleavage of H2O did not act as the rate-determining step of WGS reaction for four catalysts. The positive CO reaction orders of 0.14 ∼ 0.49 were obtained for four catalysts, indicating the weak CO adsorption and low CO surface coverage on the surface of various Ni catalysts which was further supported by the CO-DRIFTS results (Table 1) [6]. As shown in Fig. S2, the characteristic peaks of gaseous CO at ∼2115 cm-1 and ∼2170 cm-1 were only observed and rapidly disappeared within 5 min after the cutting-off of CO, suggesting the weak adsorption of CO on the Ni sites [7]. Therefore, it was preliminarily speculated that the elementary steps of CO adsorption and activation could be the rate-determining step of WGS reaction over different supported Ni catalysts. 3.2 Structural characterization To further understand the support effects on the Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction, the physicochemical properties of supported Ni catalysts were characterized. ICP-OES results demonstrated that the actual loadings are ∼ 3.0 wt% which is close to the nominal loading (Table 1). The basic structural properties were characterized by TEM, XRD and N2 physisorption techniques. The Ni nanoparticles on various supports were obviously observed from TEM images (Fig. S3). The average sizes of Ni nanoparticles were 3.4 nm, 6.1 nm, 4.3 nm, 5.2 nm and 2.5 nm for the Ni/CeO2, Ni/ZrO2, Ni/Al2O3, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding Ni dispersions measured by CO pulse chemisorption were 29.8 %, 10.7 %, 7.2 %, 10.1 % and 5.9 %, respectively (Table 1). The measured surface dispersions of Ni nanoparticles on different supports did not exactly match their sizes mainly due to the weaker CO adsorption which was verified by the CO-DRIFTS and positive CO reaction orders. However, it can still be concluded based on the TEM results that large specific surface area of supports can contribute to the dispersion of Ni species. No signals of Ni or NiOx species were observed on the supported Ni catalysts from XRD patterns due to the low Ni loading (Fig. S3f). Overall, the catalytic activity is not correlated to the sizes or surface areas of supported Ni catalysts, indicating that these factors are not decisive for the Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction. The support-dependent reaction mechanism was further discussed to understand the differences of supported Ni catalysts in WGS reaction. 3.3 Reaction mechanism The WGS reaction over Ni-based catalysts proceeds via either redox or associative pathways with the different rate-determining steps which is heavily dependent on the surface/interface structures of catalysts. Therefore, in-situ DRIFTS was performed to monitor the dynamic behavior of surface species under reaction condition. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S4, the surface carbonates were dominated on the surface of Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/TiO2 while the surface carbonates and formats coexisted for the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2 catalysts. Specifically, the IR bands at 800–1000 cm-1, 1388 cm-1 and 1488 cm-1 were attributed to different CO vibration modes of polydentate carbonate [25,26]. The peak at 1419∼1450 cm-1 was assigned to the bridged carbonate or bicarbonate species [27,28]. The signals of bidentate carbonates were also detected which are located at ∼1290 cm-1, 1325 cm-1 and ∼1550 cm-1, respectively [25,26,29]. Notably, the strength of most of IR peaks increased with increasing the reaction temperature, demonstrating that the carbonates accumulated on the surface of catalysts. However, the intensity of formats (ca. 2830 cm-1 and 2940 cm-1) firstly increased below 300 °C and then decreased when the reaction temperature further increased [25,26]. Consequently, the formats were speculated a potential reaction intermediate. To further verify this hypothesis, the dynamic behavior of surface species was monitored after the cutting-off of CO in the reactant gases. It can be found that the signals of gaseous CO at 2117 cm-1 and 2176 cm-1 disappeared rapidly within 5 min while the characteristicpeaks of carbonates and formats almost remained unchanged over various supported Ni catalysts, indicating that surface carbonates and formats were spectators and WGS reaction did not occur via associative mechanism (Fig. 2). The isothermal surface reaction was further conducted to analyze the reaction pathways. The dynamic evolution of CO2 and H2 was continuously monitored by on-line mass spectroscopy under the simulated reactant gases. As shown in Fig. 3 , the mass signals of CO2 and H2 appeared after exposure to the gas mixture of CO/H2O/Ar. The CO2 signal exhibited a steep rise at first,followed by a slow decrease to a steady-state plateau while the H2 signal gradually increased and reached a steady state with the prolonging of reaction time. Noteworthily, CO2 was firstly produced and followed by the H2 formation for four catalysts, suggesting that CO firstly reacted with lattice oxygen of supports to create oxygen vacancies and then H2O was dissociated to the active oxygen species (e.g. OH*, O*) to fill the oxygen vacancies. In contrast to the simultaneous appearance of CO2 and H2 via the associative mechanism, the time delay between CO2 and H2 indicated that WGS reaction over various Ni catalysts proceeds via the redox mechanism [30,31]. In the other hand, it was noticed that the time gaps of Ni/CeO2, Ni/ZrO2, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/TiO2 were about 0.9 min, 1.2 min, 4.7 min and 7.0 min, respectively. The reaction of CO with oxygen species could determine the time gaps which may be closely relevant to the redox or electronic properties of catalysts. 3.4 Surface properties of catalysts H2-TPR experiments were performed to study the redox properties of catalysts. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst exhibited three main reduction peaks (Fig. 4 a). The low-temperature peak centered at ∼250 °C with a shoulder at ∼160 °C was attributed to the reduction of NiOx and surface oxygen species adjacent to Ni nanoparticles due to H-spillover process [32,33]. The reduction peak at∼375 °C was assigned to the surface reduction of CeO2 far from Ni nanoparticles and the bulk oxygen reduction occurred above 650 °C. The low-temperature peaks shifted to ∼ 265 °C, 325 °C and 396 °C for Ni/ZrO2, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/Al2O3, respectively. The results indicated that it became more difficult to reduce the NiOx species and the interfacial oxygen species along with the weaker electron transfer from the supports to Ni nanoparticles. In other words, the electronic interaction between Ni and CeO2 is stronger than those of other Ni catalysts. The Ni 2p XPS spectra were measured to investigate the electronic metal-support interaction of various supported Ni catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4b, two types of Ni species were observed for Ni/ZrO2, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/Al2O3. The peaks at 852.9 eV and 855.5 eV with a satellite peak at 861.0 eV were attributed to metallic Ni and Ni2+ species, respectively [33,34]. However, the Ni 2p XPS of Ni/CeO2 can be deconvoluted to three kinds of Ni species. Apart from the signals of metallic Ni (852.9 eV) and Ni2+(856.0 eV), a new peak at 854.4 eV appeared and was assigned to the Niδ+ interacting with CeO2 which was an indicator of different Ni-oxides interaction [33]. The calculated Ni0 ratios from the deconvoluted XPS were 12.2 %, 21.9 %,14.8 % and 1.8 % for Ni/CeO2, Ni/ZrO2, Ni/TiO2 and Ni/Al2O3, respectively. This order was negatively correlated to the reduction temperature of LT peak of catalysts except Ni/CeO2, that is, the higher ratios of Ni0 species were obtained due to stronger electron transfer from the supports to Ni nanoparticles when the catalyst was reduced more easily. It should be noted that the rapid oxidation of Ni nanoparticles could result in the lower Ni0 ratio of Ni/CeO2 owing to high oxophilicity of Ni and the excellent redox properties of CeO2 when exposed to air [35,36]. It has been reported that the electron-rich Ni nanoparticles can strengthen CO adsorption and further promote the oxidation of CO with the interfacial oxygen species [37,38]. Moreover, CO-TPD was also conducted to verify this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 4c, Ni/CeO2 exhibited multiple desorption peaks, centered at 88 °C, 194 °C and 527 °C, respectively. The first desorption peak shifted to 113 °C for Ni/ZrO2 with a weak desorption peak above 300 °C. Two desorption signals at 258 °C and 459 °C were detected for Ni/TiO2. Only one desorption peak at 334 °C was observed for Ni/Al2O3. Previous study has demonstrated that the desorption signals were actually attributed to the CO2 desorption from the oxidation of CO with different surface oxygen species [6]. The shift of desorption signals to lower temperature indicated that CO was more easily oxidized by surface oxygen species due to the stronger CO adsorption on the electron-rich Ni nanoparticles. Therefore, Ni/CeO2 can easily catalyze the oxidation of CO with active oxygen species due to the enhanced CO adsorption, resulting in the high activity of WGS reaction. Temperature-programmed surface reaction was used to monitor the catalytically dynamic behavior of CO2 and H2 during WGS process. It can be discovered that CO2 was produced in advance of H2 formation for all catalysts with increasing the reaction temperature, suggesting that the oxygen vacancies were firstly created by the reaction of CO with interfacial oxygen species, followed by H2O dissociation on the defective sites (Fig. 5 ). However, all catalysts exhibited higher hydrogen production rate than that of CO2 formation except for Ni/TiO2 when the reaction temperature was higher than 250 °C. This phenomenon is consistent to the H/D isotope experiments, indicating that H2O activation is not the rate-determining step at high temperature. The oxidation–reduction process during WGS reaction was rapidly recycled on the Ni/CeO2 catalyst due to the synergy of electron-rich Ni nanoparticles and abundant interfacial defective sites, resulting in the more significant signals of CO2 and H2 for Ni/CeO2. Although Ni/TiO2 had stronger absorption of CO than that of Ni/Al2O3, Ni/TiO2 exhibited a lower activity due to its weak ability to activate OH bond of water. Consequently, there was insufficient active oxygen species to participate in the CO oxidation. Ni/ZrO2 showed a significant increase of catalytic activity above 300 °C owing to the sufficient supply of oxygen species from H2O dissociation. As shown in Fig. 5b, it should be noted that the light-off temperatures of CO oxidation basically coincided with the results of H2-TPR, CO-TPD and Ni0 ratios, confirming again that stronger EMSI could promote CO adsorption and then enhance the catalytic activity of Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction. 3.5 Regulation of EMSI for WGS reaction The effects of EMSI on Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction were not fully understood in consideration of the complexity of support properties. Therefore, the electronic metal-support interaction of Ni/CeO2 was further tailored by changing the pretreatment temperature and the obtained catalysts were labeled as Ni/CeO2-T (T represents the reduction temperature). The surface properties of Ni/CeO2 catalysts were characterized and summarized in Table 2 . The average size of Ni nanoparticles exhibited a sluggish growth from 3.3 nm to 4.0 nm along with the decrease of Ni dispersion from 31.4 % to 28.7 % when the pretreatment temperature was increased from 300 °C to 400 °C (Fig. S5). XPS was further performed to investigate the surface electronic structures of Ni/CeO2-T catalysts (Table 2 and Fig. S6). It can be found that the ratios of Ni0 increased from 9.2 % to 16.6 % with increasing the reducing temperature, indicating that stronger electronic metal-support interaction existed in the Ni/CeO2–400 catalyst. Compared to the Ni/CeO2–300 and Ni/CeO2–350 catalysts, the Ni 3p XPS peak of the Ni/CeO2–400 catalyst shifted to a lower binding energy, suggesting again that more electrons were transferred from CeO2 to Ni after reduction at higher temperature (Fig. S6b). The Ce 3d and O 1 s XPS spectra were deconvoluted to analyze the concentration of surface defects [33,34]. Surface Ce3+ concentrations were 21.3 %, 22.8 % and 25.2 % for the Ni/CeO2–300, Ni/CeO2–350 and Ni/CeO2–400 catalysts, respectively. The corresponding concentrations of surface oxygen vacancy were 44.0 %, 49.5 and 52.5 %, respectively. This confirmed that the pre-reduction at higher temperature improved the reduction degree of Ni/CeO2 catalyst and induced stronger electronic metal-support interaction. The EMSI effects of Ni/CeO2 catalysts on the WGS reaction were further evaluated and shown in Fig. 6 . Although the average size of Ni/CeO2–400 catalyst was larger, it still exhibited a higher CO conversion at the same condition, compared to its counterparts of Ni/CeO2–300 and Ni/CeO2–350 catalysts (Fig. 6a). Typically, the Ni-weighted normalized rates of CO conversion at 300 °C were 1389.61 mmol·gNi -1·h-1, 1644.35 mmol·gNi -1·h-1 and 1832.23 mmol·gNi -1·h-1 for the Ni/CeO2–300, Ni/CeO2–350 and Ni/CeO2–400 catalysts, respectively (Table 2). Meanwhile, the CH4 selectivity of Ni/CeO2 catalysts gradually grew from 0.8 % to 4.3 % at 300 °C (Fig. S7). The Ni-normalized specific rates of CO conversion were linearly correlated with the ratios of Ni0, indicating that strong electronic metal-support interaction of Ni/CeO2 strengthened CO adsorption and oxidation at the interfacial sites (Fig. 6b). In the other hand, the H/D isotope experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of oxygen vacancies on H2O activation. The KIE values showed a slight decrease from 1.53 to 1.28, suggesting that the abundant interfacial Ov sites can accelerate the H2O activation and more active oxygen species from H2O dissociation can participate in the CO oxidation. The dynamic evolution of CO2 and H2 produced from WGS process was further monitored by on-line mass spectroscopy (Fig. 7 ). It can be revealed that the signal of CO2 from CO oxidation shifted from 68 °C to 56 °C with the increase of electron density of Ni nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the signal of H2 from H2O dissociation also displayed a similar trend of low-temperature shift. As a comparison, the CO+H2O-TPSR was also performed on the pure CeO2. The signals of CO2 and H2 on pure CeO2 were significantly weaker than those of Ni/CeO2 (Fig. S8), suggesting that the metal-support interface is highly active for the CO oxidation and H2O dissociation. The TPSR results demonstrated again that the pretreatments at higher temperature can induce stronger interfacial electronic metal-support interaction and create more interfacial defect sites, resulting in the acceleration of two half-reactions of CO oxidation and H2O dissociation in the WGS process. Noteworthily, the enhanced catalytic activity of Ni/CeO2–400 catalyst should be mainly attributed to the stronger CO adsorption and activation on the electron-rich Ni sites instead of the facile H2O dissociation due to the normal secondary H/D isotope effect. 4 Conclusions In summary, the origin of support-dependent catalytic behavior of WGS reaction over the Ni catalysts was revealed systematically by the combination of ex/in-situ experimental results. The catalytic activity of various Ni catalysts above 300 °C followed the order: Ni/CeO2 > Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/TiO2 > Ni/SiO2. It was discovered by in-situ DRIFTS and TPSR experiments that the reaction was operated through the redox mechanism on all catalysts. All catalyst showed a positive reaction order of CO and low H/D KIE values, indicating that the CO adsorption/oxidation could act as the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Based on the H2-TPR, XPS and CO-TPD results, it could be concluded that the support-dependent electronic metal-support interaction was identified as the key descriptor of Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction. A linear relationship between the CO conversion and the Ni0 ratios from the Ni/CeO2 catalysts pretreated at different temperatures further demonstrated that strong electronic metal-support interaction induced the electron enrichment of Ni nanoparticles, accelerated the CO conversion and finally improved the catalytic activity of WGS reaction. This work illuminates the nature of the support effects and highlights the key role of electronic metal-support interaction on the tunning the Ni-catalyzed WGS reaction, providing a simple and efficient descriptor for the design of high-efficiency Ni-based WGS catalyst.

        "dc:description": "The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is an important chemical process for hydrogen production and purification. The Ni-based catalyst is considered as a potential substitute for Fe and Cu-based catalysts. However, the origin of support-dependent catalytic behavior of WGS reaction over supported Ni catalysts was not well understood. Herein, a series of Ni-based catalysts with the reducible and irreducible oxides as supports were synthesized and evaluated in the WGS reaction. The catalytic activity followed the sequence: Ni/CeO2 >Ni/ZrO2 >Ni/Al2O3 >Ni/TiO2 >Ni/SiO2. WGS reaction over Ni-based catalysts proceeded via redox mechanism with the CO adsorption/activation as the rate-determining step. Combined with the ex/in-situ characterizations, it was concluded that the strength of support-dependent electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) was identified as the performance descriptor for WGS reaction. The stronger EMSI for Ni/CeO2 accelerated the surface electron enrichment of Ni nanoparticles which strengthened CO adsorption and promoted CO oxidation with the interfacial oxygen species.",
