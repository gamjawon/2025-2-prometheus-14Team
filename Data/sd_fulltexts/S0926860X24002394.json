Heterogeneous oxide couplers represent a type of emerging composite materials with inherently outstanding interface properties for electrocatalytic applications. In this study, we fabricate a Ru-Co nano-oxide coupler that enables internal electron transfer between Ru and Co elements. The catalyst exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance compared to commercial RuO2, with mere 260 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. The exchange current density (i0) for RuO2/Co3O4 is enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to commercial RuO2. Electrochemical characterizations and computational analysis reveal that the coupling of Co3O4 and RuO2 enhances the surface's capability for water dissociation on the interface Ru sites, thereby initiating OER. The exceptional performance of RuO2/Co3O4 enables water splitting via a single-cell AA battery configuration that utilizes a RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup. This accomplishment underscores the potential of RuO2/Co3O4 for effective and sustainable electrochemical water splitting applications. Graphical Abstract Coupling RuO2 with strip-like Co3O4 has induced the formation of more surface oxygen-containing species by accelerating water dissociation and thus results in the proceeding of fast OER.

Electrochemical water splitting is consisted of two half-reactions, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER process takes place at the anode, however, normally has intrinsic more sluggish kinetics because it involves a more intricate 4-proton-coupled electron transfer process compared to the 2e-transfer HER process [3,4]. Consequently, the anodic OER demands a higher energy input and a larger overpotential during water electrolysis compared to the cathodic HER [5], consequently limiting the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. At present, noble metal-based catalysts, such as Ru- and Ir-based materials, are considered among the most efficient OER electrocatalysts, particularly Ru due to its less scarcity and lower price [6–8]. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to further reducing the cost of noble metal-based catalysts and promoting the performance for boosting their practical application. A widely adopted strategy towards enhancing performance involves tailoring the surface atomic/electronic configuration and local electrochemical environment of noble metals to maximize their OER activity. Noble metal-coupled transition metal compounds, such as oxides [9–14], chalcogenides [15], and hydro(oxy)oxides [16,17], stand out an effective candidates for this goal. Transition metals like Fe/Co/Ni-based materials showcase promising electrocatalytic activities for OER independently due to their moderate chemical bond strengths with OER intermediates [18–22]. Among these transition metals, Co oxides, known for their high electrical conductivity, have garnered significant attention as OER catalysts in alkaline media [9,11,23]. However, their performance has been not sufficient yet for practical application, due to either the insufficient intrinsic activity or low exposure of surface active centers, or both [19,24,25]. The use of composite oxides (coupling with noble metals, e.g., Ru) may be feasible and promising to address this issue [26,27]. This is based on the fact that the Ru oxide (RuO2) is one of the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts due to the optimal adsorption free energy with OER intermediates like *OOH [28], and also the excellent ability for H2O dissociation [29].The coupling of Co oxide with Ru oxide may accelerate the charge transfer rate via tuning interface active sites during OER, towards the promotion of surface intermediate formation and reaction, resulting in high OER performance [30,31]. Recently, the OER performance of RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst has been examined in highly acidic [32] and neutral media [33], the interface synergistic effect of Co3O4/RuO2 complex has been preliminarily revealed to act in the high OER activity [34]. Since the Co3O4/RuO2 is more stable in alkaline medium than neutral and acidic media, the detailed mechanism for alkaline OER on RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst is worth to be further in-depth understood for guiding the design of such kind of composite catalyst. This investigation utilized the potential of Co oxide to augment the electrocatalytic activity of OER on a Ru oxide surface, achieved through the development of a Ru-Co nano-oxide coupler catalyst. The RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst showcased high OER activity compared to the commercially available RuO2. Impressively, RuO2/Co3O4 displayed an overpotential of merely 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Physicochemical and computational analyses revealed that the coupling Co3O4 with RuO2 could not only trigger the generation of an increased number of surface oxygen-containing species by catalyzing water dissociation, but also balance the energy barrier change during OER processes to maximize the overall performance. The performance of this material was further explored through a RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup for overall water splitting, affirming its viability for practical applications. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and reagents Commercially available materials were utilized in this study. Pt/C (20 wt%Pt, Johnson Matthey), Ru (IV) oxide (Alfa Aesar), potassium hydroxide (≥85%), cobalt nitrate (98.5%), ethanol (99.7%), ruthenium trichloride (≥35%Ru), concentrated hydrochloric acid (≥37%), and Nafion solution (5 wt%, Dupont) were purchased and directly used. Nickel foam, acquired from commercial sources, was treated with a 3 M HCl solution and acetone to eliminate surface oxides and organic contaminants prior to use. Carbon paper, obtained from commercial sources, was used as received. Electrochemical tests were conducted using O2 (≥99.999%) as the test gas. 2.2 Synthesis of RuO2/Co3O4 To synthesize RuO2/Co3O4, a standard procedure was applied. Initially, 0.5 g cobalt nitrate and a specific amount of ruthenium trichloride (atomic ratio of RuCo = 0.08:1) were dissolved in 50 mL ethanol under ultrasonic agitation, forming a homogeneous solution. This solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined container sealed within a hydrothermal reactor. The system was heated to 150 °C and maintained at this temperature for 6 h. Following the solvothermal reaction, the resultant mixture was filtered, rinsed with ethanol and deionized water, and subsequently dried at 60 °C overnight to yield a mixed metal powder. This powder was then positioned in a porcelain boat and introduced into a tube furnace, where it underwent heat treatment at 300 °C under the air flow of ca. 50 sccm for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting material was identified as RuO2/Co3O4. The RuO2/Co3O4 samples prepared via controlling the Ru:Co ratios (0.02:1; 0.04:1; 0.16:1) were also obtained for comparison. Additionally, Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 samples were synthesized using analogous solvothermal methods. The former was produced through solvothermal reaction alone, while the latter involved both solvothermal reaction and subsequent heating treatment. Notably, the synthesis of these materials was performed without the addition of ruthenium trichloride. For the purpose of condition optimization, samples encompassing different Ru atomic ratios and heating treatment temperatures were also synthesized and subjected to electrochemical testing. 2.3 Materials characterization The nanostructure and atomic configurations of the synthesized electrocatalysts were characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F). For determining elemental distribution of Ru, Co, and O, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was employed. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.154 nm) on an X-ray powder diffractometer (Philip Xhilip Pro MPP), at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Kratos-Axis spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.71 eV) under high vacuum condition at 3×10−10 mbar. X-ray radiation was generated at 15 kV and 10 mA. Prior to measurement, in-lens electron and low-energy Ar+ sources were utilized to neutralize the charge on the electrocatalysts. C-correction had been done using the standard binding energy of 284.8 eV. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Raman spectrometer (Ramos S120, Ostec-ArtTool, LLC, Moscow) equipped with a 50× long working distance objective and a 532 nm excitation wavelength. Raman shift calibration was done using a silicon standard sample (520.7 cm−1) to ensure measurement accuracy. The quantification of Ru and Co within the catalyst was accomplished utilizing an Ultima2 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Jobin Yvon). 2.4 Electrochemical measurements An electrochemical workstation (CH Instrument Inc.) connected to a three-electrode electrolytic cell with an anion-exchange membrane was utilized for performing the electrochemical experiments. The electrolyte was a 1 M KOH solution saturated with O2. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (in a KCl solution) and the counter electrode was a graphite rod. The working electrode employed a catalyst-coated glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a diameter of 4.0 mm. In the preparation of the working electrode, 10 mg of the catalyst (either the prepared materials or commercial RuO2) was mixed with a solution containing 50 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution and 950 μL of isopropanol. This mixture underwent ultrasonic treatment for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 4 μL of the resulting ink was pipetted and spread on the polished surface of the GC electrode, followed by drying under an infrared lamp. The catalyst loading on the electrode was maintained at 32 μg cm−2. Steady-state polarization curves for the electrocatalysts were obtained through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at the scan rate of 0.01 V s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using a potential amplitude of 0.005 V and a frequency range of 100,000 to 0.01 Hz. To assess the anode stability of the electrocatalysts during OER, chronopotentiometry was conducted. All potentials mentioned were converted to standard potentials vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the formula: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197. The electrical double-layer capacitor (Cdl) and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) were also assessed through CV tests conducted in non-Faraday regions at different scan rates. The cathodic/anodic currents were plotted against the scan rate, and linear fitting provided the slope. The average of the absolute cathodic/anodic slopes was employed to determine Cdl using the formula: Cdl = (|jc| + ja)/(2 v) = Δj/(2 v) [35], where v is the scan rate and jc/ja represents the cathodic/anodic current. ECSA was then calculated using the equation: ECSA = Cdl/Cs, with Cs denoting the standard capacitance for a flat electrode (1 cm−2). A typical value of 40 μF cm−2 was applied in this context. Electrochemical activities determined by LSV curves were analysed at temperatures of 273.15, 288.15, 298.15, and 313.15 K to ascertain the apparent activation energy (Ea). The KOH electrolyte temperature was regulated by immersing the electrolytic cell in a thermostatic water bath for an hour. The Ea was calculated using the formula: ∂log i/∂(1/T) = -Ea/2.303 R [36], wherein T is the absolute temperature (in K) and R signifies the universal gas constant. The i values were acquired within the potential range of 1.6–1.7 V vs. RHE. For the evaluation of overall water splitting performance, a custom-made two-electrode apparatus was employed. Nickel foam coated with RuO2/Co3O4 or RuO2 electrocatalyst served as the anode, while Pt/C electrocatalyst-coated carbon cloth was employed as the cathode. A 1 M KOH solution was served as the electrolyte. The electrocatalyst ink of RuO2/Co3O4, RuO2, or Pt/C was applied to the substrate (1 cm2) at a mass loading of 1 mg cm−2 to fabricate the electrodes. LSV curves were obtained in the electrolyser employing the RuO2/Co3O4||Pt/C or RuO2||Pt/C setup to compare the overall water splitting performance. Practical application of overall water splitting was demonstrated using an AA battery (Nanfu CO., LTD.). 2.5 Computational method Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Quantum Espresso (QE) software employing the pseudopotential plane wave (PPW) method [37,38]. The exchange-correlation energies were described using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. To represent the ionic cores and include valence electrons, we utilized the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials [39,40], employing a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV for all relaxation processes. The Brillouin-zone sampling was conducted using Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grids of special points with the separation of 0.04 Å−1. To ensure accurate results, we set the convergence criteria at 10−5 eV for energy and 0.02 eV/Å for force calculations. For both geometry optimization and electronic self-consistency, we employed k-point meshes cantered at the Gamma point. Additionally, in all structural simulations, we included a 20 Å vacuum region to minimize interactions between adjacent image cells. A semiempirical DFT-D3 force-field approach was used to include the physical van der Waals (vdW) interaction in our calculations. The supercell sizes were set to 2×2×2 for RuO2 model and 1×1×1 for Co3O4 model. After that, we cut (111) surface for RuO2 and (311) surface for Co3O4, respectively. On this basis, a third adsorption bulk is obtained by coupling these two structural surfaces together. In addition to this, we have established the structure of coupling amorphous RuO2 and amorphous CoOOH. Then we performed structural optimization and calculated the OER performance of these four structures. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis of RuO2/Co3O4 material followed the procedure depicted in Fig. 1a. Cobalt nitrate and ruthenium chloride were employed as the cobalt and ruthenium sources, respectively. The synthesis involved a solvothermal reaction and a subsequent heat treatment process. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images are illustrated in Fig. 1b and S1, revealing the presence of strip-like structures of the sample. The presence of abundant nanopores offers advantages in electrocatalysis, as these pores facilitate mass transport for both reactants and products. High-magnification TEM (Fig. 1c) unveiled interplanar crystal spacings measuring 2.46 and 2.79 Å, corresponding to the (311) and (111) planes of Co3O4. Fig. 1d showcases a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image comprising multiple diffraction rings, signifying the presence of polycrystalline metal compounds. The diffraction rings were matched to the lattice planes of CoCl2 (110), as well as Co3O4 (220), (311), (400), (440), and (511), closely according with the following XRD analysis. Furthermore, Fig. 1e illustrates elemental mapping, providing additional confirmation of the uniform distribution of Co, Ru, and O on the RuO2/Co3O4 material surface. Due to its lower Ru content compared to Co, the EDS signal for Ru is relatively weak. Quantitative analysis by ICP-OES method revealed that the Co and Ru contents in the optimized RuO2/Co3O4 material were 60.3 wt% and 2.9 wt%, respectively. Therefore, the real ratio of Ru:Co in the RuO2/Co3O4 material is 0.028:1. Overall, the RuO2/Co3O4 material was effectively synthesized using solvothermal and heat treatment processes, and it presents as a strip-like structure. The as-prepared materials at each synthesis stage were characterized by XRD analysis. The results depicted in Fig. 2a and S2 (Supporting Information) revealed that during the initial alcohol-thermal step, the Co(OH)2 precursor was acquired, exhibiting the distinctive α-Co(OH)2 phase (PDF: 46–0605). This was discernible from the presence of crystal faces (001), (002), and (100) at 2θ values of 10.5°, 25.1°, and 33.8°, respectively. Notably, certain small peaks linked to Co3O4 were also discernible in the sample, suggesting the co-presence of a minor Co3O4 quantity due to the elevated solvothermal temperature. Following heating at higher temperatures, only peaks corresponding to Co3O4 (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) crystal faces were observed at 2θ values of 19.0°, 31.3°, 36.8°, 44.8°, 59.3°, and 65.2°, respectively. This result indicated the transformation of most α-Co(OH)2 phase into pure Co3O4 phase (PDF: 42–1467) after heating treatment. Introduction of ruthenium trichloride in the synthesis revealed a new RuO2 phase at 32.1°, aligned with the (111) crystal plane (PDF: 50–1428), consistent with SAED analysis. Notably, the presence of CoCl2•H2O (PDF: 25–0242) in the RuO2/Co3O4 material was evident through the appearance of the (110) crystal face at 16.1°, a likely outcome of ion recombination between Co2+ ions from cobalt nitrate and Cl- ions from ruthenium trichloride. Thus, the low ruthenium trichloride content did not result in the corresponding peak (refer to Figure S2), potentially due to it was shielded by other species. Elevated-temperature treatment (e.g., 400 °C) facilitated the conversion of CoCl2 into Co3O4, indicated by the disappearance of the (110) crystal face and the augmentation of peaks linked to Co3O4 in Figure S2. In essence, the main constituents in RuO2/Co3O4, Co3O4, and Co(OH)2 are RuO2/Co3O4, Co3O4, and Co(OH)2/Co3O4, respectively. To reveal the interaction between RuO2 and Co3O4 in the RuO2/Co3O4 sample, Raman spectra were conducted, as depicted in Fig. 2b. Five characteristic peaks were discerned, located at 192.7, 478.8, 519.6, 617.7, and 687.3 cm−1, corresponding to the F2 g, Eg, F2 g, F2 g, and A1 g vibrational modes of Co3O4, respectively. In comparison to the Co3O4 sample, the RuO2/Co3O4 material did not exhibit distinct new characteristic peaks for RuO2, likely due to the limited Ru content. However, the band around 805 cm−1 observed in the Co3O4 sample, indicative of (O-M-O) vibration [41], become less noticeable in the RuO2/Co3O4 sample, suggesting possible damage of this bond structure. XPS was utilized to investigate the elemental composition and valence states of the RuO2/Co3O4 and Co3O4 samples. As depicted in Fig. 2c, apart from the observed O, C, and Co signals in the Co3O4 sample, the XPS survey spectra reveal the presence of the Ru signal on the surface of the RuO2/Co3O4 sample. Impressively, there are no supplementary XPS signals indicative of impurities, underscoring the high purity of the prepared materials. High-resolution Co 2p spectra were deconvoluted into six sub-peaks for both samples, corresponding to the spin orbitals of Co 2p1/2 (Co2+ at 796.3 eV, Co3+ at 794.8 eV) and Co 2p3/2 (Co2+ at 781.1 eV, Co3+ at 779.6 eV), along with two satellite peaks (786.5 eV and 804.6 eV) [42,43], as demonstrated in Fig. 2d and e. The atomic percentage of Co3+ and Co2+ was 2.8% and 97.2% for RuO2/Co3O4, while for Co3O4, the percentages were 41.7% and 58.3%, respectively. Thus, the main component in the RuO2/Co3O4 material was Co2+ species. Notably, the addition of Ru led to a decline in the Co3+ species, indicating electronic interaction between Co and Ru species. This interaction might involve electron transfer from low-valence Ru to Co3+ species. This is further backed by the high-resolution Ru 3p XPS spectrum of RuO2/Co3O4 (Fig. 2f), where well-defined peaks at 486.6 and 464.5 eV correspond to 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 signals for Ru4+. Therefore, Ru4+ is the main species in the RuO2/Co3O4 sample and Ru0 species exists, denoting a partial charge transfer from Ru to Co. In the O 1 s XPS spectra of both samples (Fig. 2g and h), three deconvoluted peaks were identified: M-O bond (M: Ru or Co) at 530.3 eV, hydroxyl oxygen species at 531.8 eV, and H2Oad at 533.4 eV [44]. In the RuO2/Co3O4 sample, the atomic percentage of M-O, hydroxyl oxygen, and H2Oad species was 39.4%, 56.5%, and 4.1% respectively, while for Co3O4, it was 55.2%, 44.1%, and 0.6%, as illustrated in Fig. 2i. The OER performance was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Initial assessments were conducted on RuO2/Co3O4 samples treated at different temperatures, as illustrated in Figure S3. Notably, the RuO2/Co3O4-300 catalyst exhibited superior OER activity, characterized by a low onset potential of 1.43 V vs. RHE and low overpotentials across all current densities (e.g., 260 mV @ 10 mA cm−2). The composition ratios of Ru and Co were also optimized (Figure S4), with the most effective Ru:Co ratio in the synthesis determined as 0.08:1. Both excessively high and low Ru content led to the decreases in OER activity. While Ru sites are generally considered highly active sites in comparison to Co. Enhanced OER activity is usually correlated with increased Ru content. However, excessive Ru content didn't consistently yield positive effects on OER activity in this study. The promotion effect of Ru is evident in the RuO2/Co3O4-300 catalyst, which had significantly higher OER current compared to Co3O4 and Co(OH)2 catalysts ( Fig. 3a). The RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst's OER performance even surpasses commercial RuO2 and is on par with other advanced Ru-based OER electrocatalysts (Table S1). The Tafel plots (Fig. 3b) illuminate the relationship between overpotential and current under steady state conditions. The slopes for RuO2/Co3O4, Co3O4, Co(OH)2, and RuO2 samples were 140, 121, 158, and 109 mV dec−1, respectively. The higher slope of RuO2/Co3O4 compared to Co3O4 is probably arisen from its lower onset potential for OER. The exchange current density (i0), a measure of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity [3], was derived from the extended Tafel curve to the overpotential point at 0 V. Despite the Tafel slope of RuO2/Co3O4 is slightly higher than RuO2, the i0 values for the two catalysts were 2.5×10−10 and 1×10−13 mA cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, i0 of RuO2/Co3O4 is three orders of magnitude greater than that of commercial RuO2, likely due to its lower onset potential for OER. Consequently, RuO2/Co3O4 shows superior intrinsic activity for OER compared to RuO2. These findings render RuO2/Co3O4 as a promising electrocatalyst for OER applications. Electrochemical stability is another vital performance parameter, assessed through chronopotentiometry at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h. This data, illustrated in Fig. 3c, reveals varying degrees of performance degradation induced by the oxidative conditions, as evidenced by the increase in potentials. Notably, for the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst, the potential increase to only 1.6 V after 24 h’s test. In contrast, the corresponding potential for the Co3O4, Co(OH)2, and commercial RuO2 catalysts jumped to the value higher than 2.0 V within 6.2, 3.3, and 5.6 h, respectively. Evidently, these outcomes underscore the superior electrocatalytic durability and stability of the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst relative to other Co-based catalysts and commercial RuO2. The better stability after the addition of Ru may be due to the enhanced O2 desorption capability. This phenomenon was also observed in heterogeneous Fe oxide/Co oxide coupler [35]. Additionally, the presence of Co, which potentially prevents excessive oxidation of Ru oxide into soluble RuO4 - species, a phenomenon not observed with pure RuO2 catalysts [30,45]. The investigation into the structural and compositional changes following the stability test was carried out through XRD and XPS analyses. As depicted in Figure S5, the XRD pattern of the RuO2/Co3O4 sample post stability test displays notable changes. The disappearance of the (110) crystal plane associated with CoCl2•H2O and the (111) crystal plane related to the RuO2 phase suggests their transformation into other species or amorphous structures. While most peaks attributed to Co3O4 are retained, their intensity diminishes, indicating the presence of the Co3O4 phase and potential partial conversion into other species and/or amorphous phases. XPS spectra (Figure S6) acquired after the stability test reveal negative shifts in binding energy for the Ru 3p and Co 2p regions, suggesting possible phase changes accompanied by the generation of new surface species, such as CoOOH [43]. Moreover, the atomic percentage of hydroxyl oxygen species reduced to 32.9%, accompanied by an increased M-O ratio. Notably, the overall oxygen content increased from 39.3% to 43% post stability test, implying oxygen integration and binding with metals during OER. Several surface component/structure-related electrochemical analyses were performed to unveil the origin of the amplified OER performance on the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst. First, we probed the surface composition and bonding species via a 3600-s open circuit potential (OCP) test. It is widely recognized that the generation of oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface can trigger a positive OCP shift [46]. These species, encompassing *OH and *O entities, are pivotal intermediates during OER. A greater abundance of these species indicates a more facile initiation of OER via water dissociation, consequently augmenting OER activity. The results in Fig. 3d show that Co-based materials subjected to heating treatment (RuO2/Co3O4 and Co3O4 samples) exhibit notably higher OCP values compared to the Co(OH)2 sample. Given that heating treatment transforms Co(OH)2 into Co3O4, it's reasonable to infer that Co3O4 promotes water dissociation. Furthermore, the addition of Ru seems to bolster this water dissociation capacity, suggesting the malleable electronic structure of Co by Ru – a trend consonant with XPS findings. Notably, the RuO2/Co3O4 prepared here demonstrates the highest OCP at 0.08 V vs. RHE, implying an easier generation of oxygen-containing species on its surface, possibly due to the coupling between Co3O4 and RuO2. This agrees well with a prior study where Co-Ir coupler displayed a stronger surface binding energy with water molecules, facilitating water dissociation into *OH [47]. Consequently, the heightened water dissociation on the RuO2/Co3O4 surface likely supports its accelerated OER kinetics. Second, the charge transfer efficiency during the OER process was assessed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As illustrated in Fig. 3e, the x-intercept yielded the information about the series resistance, encompassing electrode wiring and electrolyte resistance, which amounted to 7 Ω for all three electrocatalysts. Notably, all three electrocatalysts exhibited a short circular arc at 1.523 V within the high-frequency range in the EIS plots, indicative of the electron transfer step during OER. By employing an equivalent circuit [6,9,15], the fitting parameters were extracted and presented in Table S2. Evidently, the RuO2/Co3O4 electrocatalyst exhibited the lowest Rct of 2.29 Ω. Hence, the incorporation of Ru results in an augmented charge-transfer capability, consequently enhancing OER kinetics for the Co3O4 electrocatalyst. Thirdly, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the prepared catalysts was assessed by determining the surface Cdl through CV curves at varying scan rates within non-Faraday regions. As depicted in Figure S7 and S8, the average of cathodic and anodic slopes was employed to calculate Cdl, resulting in values of 0.0068, 0.0055, 0.034, 0.0122, and 0.0062 mF for Co(OH)2, Co3O4, RuO2/Co3O4-200, RuO2/Co3O4-300, and RuO2/Co3O4-400, respectively. Thus, ECSA derived from Cdl was determined as 4.25, 3.44, 21.25, 7.63, and 3.87 cm2 mg−1 for Co(OH)2, Co3O4, RuO2/Co3O4-200, RuO2/Co3O4-300, and RuO2/Co3O4-400, respectively. Evidently, an elevation in temperature during the heating treatment of the RuO2/Co3O4 material corresponded to a reduction in ECSA. Additionally, the inclusion of Ru in the materials induced a slight ECSA increase, likely attributed to the enhanced nucleation and/or nanoparticle downsizing during synthesis. A larger ECSA generally offers a greater number of active sites for OER. However, when compare the catalysts’ activity normalized to the corresponding ECSA, the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst still showed the highest HER activity, with the lowest overpotential of ca. 310 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Therefore, the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst has the highest intrinsic activity, attributing to the formation of highly active sites. Lastly, the activation energy associated with OER was determined through temperature-dependent LSV curves. Illustrated in Fig. 3f and S10, elevating the temperature of the catalyst-coated GC electrode from 273.15 to 313.15 K led to a increase in current across the LSV curves at identical potentials, indicative of heightened electrocatalytic activity across all examined electrocatalysts. Consequently, Arrhenius plots were derived from the correlation between temperature and current for each assessed sample. These plots were then linearly fitted to determine the slope, allowing the calculation of activation energy via the equation: ∂log i/∂(1/T) = -Ea/2.303 R. Consequently, the apparent activation energy values were determined as 20.2, 33.5, and 40.8 kJ mol−1 for RuO2/Co3O4, Co(OH)2, and Co3O4 electrocatalysts, respectively. Notably, the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst exhibited the lowest activation energy among the samples, implying the most favorable thermodynamic processes during OER. We further investigated the potential rate-determining steps and reaction barriers for the OER using various intermediates in an alkaline environment on individual catalysts, namely Co3O4, RuO2, and the hybrid RuO2/Co3O4, as well as RuO2/CoOOH materials. The determination of these steps was based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Fig. 4 and S11 illustrate the adsorption configurations of intermediates and the corresponding free energy (ΔG) diagrams. Our findings reveal that over RuO2 material, the rate-determining step is the formation of *O from *OH on Ru sites, with energy barrier of 0.74 eV. In the case of and Co3O4, RuO2/Co3O4, and RuO2/CoOOH, the rate-determining step changes to the dissociation of water to generate *OH on Ru sites, with an energy barriers of 1.45, 0.44, and 0.35 eV, respectively. The energy barrier for the rate-determining step on Co3O4, is notably higher compared to the other catalysts. The coupling of RuO2 with Co components enhances water dissociation on the RuO2/Co3O4 and RuO2/CoOOH materials, as supported by OCP analysis. Although individual RuO2 exhibits superior water dissociation ability, the synergy between RuO2 and Co components balances each reaction barrier for the OER steps, resulting in lower energy barriers for the rate-determining step. The phenomenon related to the optimization of intermediate adsorption had also been observed in the Ru/Co3O3-x material [11]. This effect can be attributed to optimal electron redistribution that improves intermediate adsorption. Comparatively, the RuO2/CoOOH species emerge as the primary active centers in the catalyst during OER testing, displaying the lowest OER reaction barrier, consistent with electrochemical test results. Due to the outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance exhibited by the RuO2/Co3O4 material, we extended its practical application by constructing a two-electrode water splitting setup using a RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode, which was compared to a setup utilizing a RuO2 anode || Pt/C cathode. Overall water splitting performance was evaluated through LSV tests, with the resulting curves displayed in Figure S12. Notably, the onset voltage and the voltage at 10 mA cm−2 were measured as 1.42 and 1.52 V, respectively, for the RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup. These values were both lower in comparison to the RuO2 anode || Pt/C cathode system, underscoring the superior performance of the RuO2/Co3O4 material as an anode in the context of overall water splitting. Furthermore, based on the ultra-low voltage for overall water splitting, we employed a standard single-cell AA battery with a voltage of 1.5 V to power the RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup. As depicted in the photograph within Figure S13, a substantial production of hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles was observed on both electrodes following 5 min of electrocatalysis. This demonstration highlights how the robust OER activity of the RuO2/Co3O4 anode serves as a foundation for its practical application in water electrolysis. 4 Conclusions In this research, we fabricated a Ru-Co nano-oxide coupler featuring an augmented capacity for water dissociation at the surface, thereby facilitating efficient OER. The optimal RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst demonstrated remarkable OER activity surpassing that of the commercial benchmark, RuO2, with a mere 260 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Additionally, the stability of the RuO2/Co3O4 catalyst outperformed commercial RuO2. Impressively, the exchange current (i0) for RuO2/Co3O4 was elevated by three orders of magnitude in contrast to commercial RuO2, further underscored by an apparent activation energy of merely 20.2 kJ mol−1 during OER. Mechanistic investigations have elucidated that the coupling of Co3O4 and RuO2 facilitated the dissociation of surface-bound water, thereby promoting the initiation of OER. This process was balanced by other OER steps to minimizing the energy barrier change for optimally enhancing surface intermediate adsorption and catalytic reactions, consequently elevating OER performance. This pronounced OER activity has paved the way for overall water splitting within the RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup, propelled solely by a standard single-cell AA battery.

        "dc:description": "Heterogeneous oxide couplers represent a type of emerging composite materials with inherently outstanding interface properties for electrocatalytic applications. In this study, we fabricate a Ru-Co nano-oxide coupler that enables internal electron transfer between Ru and Co elements. The catalyst exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance compared to commercial RuO2, with mere 260 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2. The exchange current density (i0) for RuO2/Co3O4 is enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to commercial RuO2. Electrochemical characterizations and computational analysis reveal that the coupling of Co3O4 and RuO2 enhances the surface's capability for water dissociation on the interface Ru sites, thereby initiating OER. The exceptional performance of RuO2/Co3O4 enables water splitting via a single-cell AA battery configuration that utilizes a RuO2/Co3O4 anode || Pt/C cathode setup. This accomplishment underscores the potential of RuO2/Co3O4 for effective and sustainable electrochemical water splitting applications.",
