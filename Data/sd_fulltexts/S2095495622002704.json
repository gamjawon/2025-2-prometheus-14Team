Graphic abstract Dual-insurance strategy with the aid of polypyrrole endows the EGaSn to keep conductive and adhesive features, which effectively prevents their detachment behavior and makes the final self-healing anodes exhibit superior electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries. The gallium-based liquid metal as one of the self-healing materials has gained wide attention, especially in the energy storage system. However, volume expansion with the “liquid–solid-liquid” transformation process still leads to un-controlled electrode failure, which stimulates the irreversibility of liquid metal and hinders their self-healing effect as the anode for lithium-ion batteries. Herein, the polypyrrole (PPy) with highly conductive and adhesive features is first introduced to fasten the liquid metal nanoparticles (gallium-tin alloy, EGaSn) in the integrated electrode and applied as the anode for lithium-ion batteries. A tightly PPy wrapped EGaSn nanoparticles structure is formed during the in-situ polymerization synthesis process, which effectively avoids the detachment of solid alloyed products. Based on the features of PPy, polyacrylic acid is added to facilitate strengthening the integrity of the electrode by constructing the hydrogen bond. The “dual-insurance” design endows the EGaSn to exhibit superior electrochemical kinetics and an astonishing self-healing effect. As a result, the customized anode displays superior cycling stability (499.8 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1) and rate capability (350 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1). This work enriches the electrode engineering technology of liquid metal nanoparticles and opens up a new way to customize the self-healing anode for lithium-ion batteries. Keywords Liquid metal Self-healing Polypyrrole Li-ion battery Stability 1 Introduction With the rapid advance in electronic technology, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density and power density have become the basic requirement for next-generation energy storage systems [1–3]. Among the main components of the current commercial LIBs, the general graphite anode has severely limited the energy density of the battery due to its weak hold ability that only contains one lithium-ion by every six carbon atoms [4]. Fortunately, alloy-based anodes (e.g., silicon, germanium, tin, and antimony) exhibit high specific capacity by alloying with multiple lithium ions (e.g., silicon with 4 and tin with 4.4), which boasts higher energy density as the strongest candidate [5–7]. However, during the electrochemical process, these alloys all undergo a large volume expansion, such as Si displays about 300% volume expansion when converted to fully lithiated Li15Si4. Huge volume changes accompanied by un-avoid stress boost the powdered electrode structure, which destroys the integrity of the electrode and stability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) resulting in poor battery performance [8,9]. Nanoarchitecture design is the mainstream method to efficiently alleviate the above issues, but limited areal capacity and extremely expensive/time-consuming processes cannot solve these problems fundamentally [10]. The gallium-based alloy has obtained an ardent interest in many fields, such as energy storage, catalysis, and biomedicine, as one type of alloy that is liquid at room temperature [11–13]. The fluidity and metallic conductivity of gallium-based alloy provide a research possibility for the exploration of self-healing electrodes for LIBs, such as gallium (Ga), gallium-indium alloy (EGaIn), and gallium-tin alloy (EGaSn) [14–16]. Similar to other ordinary alloy anodes, Ga also experiences a certain degree of volume expansion (about 170%) with the obvious “liquid-solid” transformation [17]. Interestingly, this phase transformation is reversible and the subsequent “solid-liquid” process can heal the cracks caused by the volume expansion. This discovery prompts Ga-based alloys to be used as an emerging self-healing additive, such as a healing agent for silicon and lithium titanate [18–22]. In addition, the preparation of nanoparticles of Ga-based alloys can be realized by a simple few minutes of sonication processing, which perfectly solves the expensive synthetic cost problems of current alloy materials [23]. However, the certain volume expansion still leads to un-controlled electro-delamination of solid products during the phase transition process. And liquid flow also exacerbates the instability of the SEI layer, which seriously restricts the self-healing effect of liquid metal in the repeated electrochemical cycling. Therefore, the effective confine of liquid metal is crucial for the perfect self-healing anode. Recently, many strategies have been conducted to solve these problems. By introducing a carbon-based material (e.g., carbon sphere [14], carbon nanotube/graphene [15], and carbon fiber [24]) to increase electrode conductivity and buffer the volume expansion stress. This method is the prevailing means, but without considering the continuous formation of the SEI film. Another strategy is to construct the adhesive network by adding an efficient binder (e.g., polyethylene oxide [25]) to restrict the flow of liquid metal and inhibit the new surface formation. The two strategies have narrowly improved the self-healing effect and battery performance. Polypyrrole (PPy) as the prominent conductive polymer has been applied in energy storage systems owing to its high conductivity, super stability, strong adhesion, and reversible redox capacity [26]. Based on the reported strategies, the combination of conductivity and adhesion will offer a reinforced protective strategy for liquid metal. Moreover, the design of the core-shell structure promotes the liquid metal to maintain its natural feature with predominant stability and easier surface reprocessing. Motivated by the “dual-insurance” strategy, the PPy-confined liquid metal (EGaSn@PPy) composite is succinctly synthesized by the chemical oxidative polymerization method. The detailed microstructure characterization of overall synthesis steps indicates that PPy has successfully coated onto the surface of EGaSn. The electronic transfer between EGaSn and PPy increases the interfacial stability, which endows the composites with higher integrity. Furthermore, more stable electrode integrity is designed with the assistance of the hydrogen bond between PPy and polyacrylic acid (PAA) [27]. Thus, the unique anode exhibits splendid cycle stability and rate performance with higher redox kinetics. This work provides a new electrode structure design strategy with the self-healing liquid metal anode for the lithium storage systems. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of pure EGaSn nanoparticles EGaSn alloy was prepared by melting with an 88:12 weight ratio of Ga and Sn. The melting point is 20.5 °C. The pure EGaSn nanoparticles were prepared by a sonication step. First, 200 mg EGaSn bulk was added into a conical centrifuge tube (50 mL) with 20 mL of deionized (DI) water. Second, the mixture was sonicated by a sonicator (Sonics Vibracell VC505) with 60% amplitude and 2 s/3 s interval for 20 min. In the final, the obtained solution was collected. It is worth noting that the sonication process is conducted in cooled water with a constant temperature of 5 °C. 2.2 Preparation of SDBS-assisted EGaSn nanoparticles Considering that the liquid EGaSn nanoparticles tend to re-fusion, we added sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS, AR, Aladdin) as a surfactant into 20 mL DI water. Then, 200 mg EGaSn was dropped into the functionalized solution. The solution was subjected to incessant sonication for 20 min at the same parameters. The resulted suspension (denoted as S-EGaSn) was collected. 2.3 Preparation of EGaSn@PPy composite The EGaSn@PPy composite was synthesized by the chemical oxidative polymerization method. First, the collected suspension (S-EGaSn) was transferred quickly to a three-necked flask. Then, 40 μL pyrrole monomer (Py, AR, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd) was added and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 20 mg iron trichloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added to the mixture. After a period of reaction time, the product was filtrated and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h. Note that the entire polymerization process is carried out at 5 °C in an argon atmosphere. 2.4 Materials characterization The microstructure and morphologies of these materials were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 450), and the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM, JEOL ARM-200F) with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The particle size distribution was investigated by the dynamic light scatterometer (DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZS). The crystal structures were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2550 V). The chemical composition and microstructure were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, IR Affinity-1). The liquid feature was evaluated by the “force-position” curve, which was obtained from the atomic force microscope (AFM, NTEGRA Spectra) [28]. 2.5 Electrochemical measurement The active composites (80 wt%, EGaSn or EGaSn@PPy), conductive additive-super P (10 wt%, MA-EN-CO-01, TIMCAL), and binder-PAA (10 wt%, Viscosity: 4000 ± 2000 mPa·S, Canrd) were mechanically mixed in DI water to form the electrode slurry. Coated the slurry onto the copper (Cu) foil and dried. Meanwhile, the active material loading was controlled at around 1.2 mg cm−2. The electrolyte (LB-266) for the electrochemical test was purchased from DoDoChem. The specific electrolyte composition is 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate (1:1:1 in volume) with 1.0 wt% vinylene carbonate. CR2016 cell was chosen and assembled in a glovebox filled with Ar for electrochemical tests, in which lithium foil (0.5 mm thickness, Canrd) acted as the counter electrode, and Celgard 2300 polypropylene film was used as the separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and rate performance were tested by the Land CT2001A battery testing system at different current densities between 0.01 and 2.0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (0.01 Hz–10 MHz) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (0.01–2.0 V, 0.02 mV s−1) were measured on a Solartron 1470E electrochemical workstation. All tests were conducted at room temperature. Besides, the cycled working electrode after being washed with solvent was used to study the electrode stability and self-healing effect by the observation of morphologies changes. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Materials preparation and characterization During the lithiation stage, liquid metal will occur “liquid-solid” phase transformation with volume expansion, making them prone to occur cracks. Since lithiation stages start from the outermost layer of the liquid metal particles [17]. The inner liquid core is squeezed out from the external cracks, resulting in partial separation of liquid alloy from a whole particle (Fig. 1 a). Then, the separated liquid part is also been solidified to form the alloyed product. Subsequently, these solid products will begin to recover to liquid during the de-lithiation process. Meanwhile, the small solid products on the outside of the particle will also return to liquid as long as it has a good electrical connection. Even so, the detachment still causes the rupture of the SEI layer, which will continuously consume lithium ions and induce irreversible loss of capacity. The worse situation is that these solid particles lost electrical connection, which would deteriorate the electrode more severely. Finally, the self-healing range of liquid metal electrodes gradually shrinks until these particles are fully in failure (Fig. 1a). Moreover, this phenomenon will be exacerbated as the particle size increases and the lithiation rate increases. To address this dilemma, a “dual insurance” electrode structure with conductive and adhesive features is designed for liquid metal nanoparticles (Fig. 1b). When the EGaSn nanoparticles are alloyed with lithium ions, the PPy layer will buffer their volume expansion. Meanwhile, the conductivity of PPy can prevent electrically detachment of solid products and the adhesion of PPy can avoid the new surface exposure. In addition, convincing the types of PPy surface functional groups, the hydrogen bond is designed in the final electrode by the addition of PAA, which can effectively enhance the integrity of the electrode and reduce the irreversible capacity depletion. Benefiting from the structural design, stable EGaSn nanoparticles can be maintained without offsetting their unique conductive and self-healing features, which can not only keep their reversibility but also prevent the powdering failure of the electrode. Therefore, the EGaSn@PPy enables a fast reaction kinetic, high reversibility, and good healing effect, which are favorable for excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The EGaSn@PPy composite was synthesized in two steps including (1) SDBS-assisted sonication of EGaSn alloy to obtain the nanoparticles dispersion and (2) in-situ polymerization of Py monomers onto EGaSn nanoparticles. The insets of Fig. 2 (a) are the real-time graphs in the experiment. The bulk metal is nearly restricted to the bottom end of the tube. After sonication, the uniform grey dispersion is obtained without precipitation. Finally, the black flocculent suspension indicates the successful synthesis of the EGaSn@PPy composite. This preparation procedure exhibits three advantages. First, instead of usual glass bottles, the choice of the conical tube is very important for the ultrasonic dispersion of liquid metal. The EGaSn appears as spherical particles in the water due to its huge surface tension. When the bulk is subjected to a huge impact force, its fluidity and surface tension will promote the displacement of the liquid metal in the plane, which increases the inhomogeneity of nanoparticles and reduce the efficiency of sonication. The conical tube can restrict the mobility of metal during the sonication process to promote the uniform production of nanoparticles. Second, SDBS as the stabilizer and surfactant can stabilize the EGaSn nanoparticles in water throughout the entire surface modification process. Meanwhile, it acts as the dopant of PPy synthesis to improve the conductivity of composites [29]. Third, the whole synthetic process is conducted under a neutral water environment, which prevents the possible oxidation and consumption of liquid metal in an aggressive environment (e.g., an acidic or alkaline environment) [30]. As such, environmental friendliness facilitates the large-scale promotion of this method. Based on these sufficient theories, the classic reactant ratio parameters were chosen to prepare the EGaSn@PPy composite (detailed parameters are shown in the experiment section). Considering that liquid metal is easily oxidized in the aqueous solution, the effect of reaction time on the uniformity of the final composite was studied and observed by SEM (Fig. S1). The results show that PPy uniformly encapsulates the particles when the reaction time is 1 h. Thus, the final experimental parameters of the EGaSn@PPy composite are determined. To further confirm the successful synthesis of the EGaSn@PPy composite, their microscopic morphologies and phase compositions were characterized. As a comparison, the pure EGaSn nanoparticles and S-EGaSn nanoparticles were also characterized. It is worth noting that the composition of the oxidation layer on gallium-based eutectic alloys is determined by the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the corresponding metal oxide [31]. The ΔG of gallium oxide (Ga2O3, −998.3 kJ mol−1) is more negative than that of tin oxide (SnO, ΔG = −251.9 kJ mol−1) and tin dioxide (SnO2, ΔG = −515.8 kJ mol−1). According to the lowest energy principle, the main component of the oxide film on the EGaSn is Ga2O3 theoretically. From the images of Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S2, the large Ga2O3 sheets and obvious smearing caused by the liquid metal rupture can be observed. No diffraction rings or spots are found from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image, indicating that these nanoparticles are amorphous [32]. The corresponding EDS maps of Ga and Sn elements show no phase separation occurred in the pure EGaSn nanoparticles [33]. The enlargement of gray boxed particles demonstrates a thick Ga2O3 layer (≈5.4 nm). These results represent the instability of pure EGaSn nanoparticles. The TEM image in Fig. 2(c) shows the successful preparation of EGaSn liquid metal nanoparticles with the aid of SDBS. The relevant SAED pattern displays an amorphous ring, which demonstrates the disorderly nature of EGaSn nanoparticles. Compared with pure EGaSn particles, the size distribution of S-EGaSn nanoparticles is more uniform with a smooth surface (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3). Similarly, the Ga and Sn elements are evenly dispersed without composition segregation. The shell thickness of Ga2O3 is about 4.2 nm from the enlarged TEM image. These results fully show the irreplaceable role of SDBS in the nanoparticle preparation process. Combined with the sheer force generated by ultrasonic cavitation, SDBS is adsorbed on the surface of EGaSn nanoparticles, which promotes the formation of stable dispersion with narrow particle size distribution and prevents the further oxidization of EGaSn. The microscopic morphology of the EGaSn@PPy composite shows a conductive and adhesive network structure (Fig. 2d and Fig. S4). The inset SAED pattern and HR-TEM images (Fig. S5) imply the invariance of EGaSn characteristics with a liquid state after the polymerization process [33]. The yellow arrow marks the obvious shape of the network frame in the constituency. The existence of the network structure will cause the widening of the size distribution range and average diameter of the EGaSn@PPy composite, which has also been confirmed by the next hydrodynamic size test. In the prepared composite, the Ga, Sn, N, and C elements are distributed uniformly. The signals of Ga and Sn purely exist in the region of nanoparticles, but C and N elements appear throughout the network. The element distribution once again proves the successful construction of the conductive and adhesive network in the EGaSn@PPy composite. To obtain the particle size distribution in suspension, the hydrodynamic diameter was tested by DLS. The profile of the size distribution diagram (Fig. 2e) illustrates that (1) the SDBS effectively reduces the size of particles and (2) the coexistence of the nano-scale and the micron-scale structure in the EGaSn@PPy. The size distribution and polydispersity index (PDI) of EGaSn nanoparticle dispersion with different surface conditions are summarized in Fig. 2(f). With the aid of SDBS, the average diameter of EGaSn nanoparticles is reduced from 382.1 to 143.5 nm. In addition, the reduced PDI value (from 0.412 to 0.070) indicates the narrowing of the size distribution range. After polymerization, the average diameter and PDI value of the composite increase to 218.8 nm and 0.363, respectively. These results fully indicate that the addition of SDBS can promote the downsizing of EGaSn nanoparticles under a high concentration (10 mg mL−1). Meanwhile, the successful polymerization expands the size distribution range of composites, indicating the formation of the PPy network. The chemical composition and microstructure of the composite were characterized to verify the successful preparation of EGaSn@PPy. The XRD patterns of the EGaSn and EGaSn@PPy are shown in Fig. 3 (a). A droplet of EGaSn was dropped onto the glass sheet to conduct the XRD test. Then, the two broad peaks at 35° and 43° are assigned to EGaSn [14]. After polymerization, a new broad peak at 22° is formed, which is related to the PPy [34]. The FT-IR result of the EGaSn@PPy is displayed in Fig. 3(b). In the spectrum, typical peaks of PPy can be noticed. The above TEM and XRD characterization results collectively certificated that the PPy coating layer has been successfully constructed. In addition, the chemical composition and chemical state of the complex have further been investigated by an in-depth XPS measurement. The representative peaks of EGaSn and PPy are observed in the survey spectrum of EGaSn@PPy (Fig. 3c) [35,36]. The N 1s region displays four characterization peaks including 397.29 eV (–N= ), 398.52 eV (–NH–), 400.59 eV (–NH+–), and 395.12 eV (metallic Ga peak), in line with the reported binding energies of PPy (Fig. 3d). Ga 3d and Sn 4d spectrum is fitted with six parts including the Ga0 at 18.76 eV, the Ga3 + at 21.16 eV, the Sn0 4d 5/2 at 23.65 eV, the Sn0 4d 3/2 at 25.10 eV, the Sn2 + 4d 5/2 at 25.55 eV, and the Sn4 + 4d 5/2 at 26.71 eV (Fig. 3e) [37]. The clear intensity difference shows that the oxide layer on the EGaSn mainly consists of Ga2O3. Ga 2p spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3(f), is divided into two typical peaks containing Ga 2p 3/2 (1119.15 eV for Ga3 + and 1117.82 eV for Ga0) and Ga 2p 1/2 (1146.03 eV for Ga3 + and 1144.22 eV for Ga0). In addition, the high-resolution C 1s fine spectrum is displayed in Fig. 3(g), which is composed of four peaks appearing at 284.80 eV (C=C), 285.42 eV (C–C), 286.02 eV (C–N), and 288.62 eV (C=O). The obvious C=C and C–N signals indicate that the PPy has been detected. As a result, the four representative in-depth XPS results reveal the existence of EGaSn and PPy in the composite. To confirm the liquid feature of EGaSn nanoparticles after sonication, the force-position curve is tested and analyzed. According to the curve, we can infer the contact relationship between the AFM tip and the material [28,38]. Meanwhile, we can also judge the deformation behavior of the sample. Considering the fluidity of liquid metal, a softer AFM tip was chosen (Si: 3.5 N m−1). Fig. 3(h) shows the force-position curve of EGaSn during the entire process of the tip approach and retraction. Inset diagrams illustrate the contact relationship between the tip and the sample. It is worth noting that the positive force in this curve is assigned to the repulsive force between the liquid metal and the tip, while the negative force indicates that their relationship is attractive. Based on this principle, the whole process can be summarized as approach (i), point-contact (ii), immersion (iii), extension, retraction (iv), pull-off, and fully departure. In the first stage, the force is constant at zero indicating that there is no contact between the sample and the tip. Subsequently, the first inflection point of force appears at the position of 710.11 nm, which shows that the probe is in contact with the sample. As the tip approaches, the force increases linearly. Then, at 465.15 nm, the force maintains constant even if the increased displacement. This phenomenon implies that the repulsive force and attractive force are equal between the tip and the sample. Moreover, this constant force also demonstrates that the liquid property of the EGaSn accompanied the tip being completely immersed in the sample. After the temporary stay, the conventional linear growth trend appears again, which shows that the tip has touched the Si substrate (the force-position of Si is shown in Fig. S6a). During the retracting process, the force-position curve does not coincide with the approach curve at all due to the existence of attractive force and viscosity of liquid metal. The first inflection point appears at 514.48 nm, indicating that the tip has begun to separate from the sample. As the distance increases, the attractive force between the AFM tip and the sample gradually decreases until completely departed from the sample. The huge viscous effect and attractive force once again prove the liquid properties of EGaSn. On the contrary, this obvious contact process is not observed in the PPy (Fig. S6b) and EGaSn@PPy composite, which indicates that the PPy coating increases the stiffness and mechanical properties of the surface. Therefore, it can be inferred from the tested curve (Fig. 3i) that the composite only undergoes several typical steps including approach (i), point-contact (ii), extension, retraction (iii), and departure. Besides, the cantilever is not immersed in liquid metal at all. In summary, these characterization results have fully verified that the EGaSn@PPy is synthesized. 3.2 Electrochemical performance As a stable protective layer self-assembled on the surface of liquid metal, PPy has superior advantages with high conductivity and strong adhesion ability, which is crucial for the electrode cycling process. Meanwhile, based on the structural characteristics of PPy, PAA has been used as the binder to facilitate the formation of a hydrogen bond, which further increases the integrity of the prepared electrode. Based on these design concepts, the EGaSn nanoparticles confined in the adhesive and conductive network structure can fully demonstrate the advantages of the electrode with self-healing, high conductivity, and high capacity (Fig. 4 a). The as-prepared composite was coated onto the Cu current collector to prepare a conceptual electrode (Fig. 4b). And a series of comprehensive electrochemical tests were conducted to evaluate its performance. The CV curve is shown in Fig. 4(c). In the cathodic scan process, the peak at 1.07 V corresponds to the formation of the SEI layer. Subsequent peaks at 0.69 and 0.4 V are related to the alloying reaction of Sn. Other peaks (0.65 and 0.55 V) are associated with Ga. In the anodic scan process, the peaks at 0.43, 0.75, and 0.92 V are relevant to the de-alloying reaction of Ga. Other oxidation peaks (0.68 and 0.89 V) are assigned to the Sn. To further confirm the Li-ion storage mechanism of EGaSn@PPy during electrochemical processes, ex-situ XRD tests were performed on EGaSn@PPy electrodes at different discharge/charge states, and the results are shown in Fig. S7. In the original XRD patterns, the peak at 30°–35° corresponds to the liquid state of EGaSn. As the discharge process proceeds, the alloying degree strengthens with the contents of lithium increase in EGaSn. A new peak at 48.6° appeared, which confirms the existence of Li2Ga7 alloy (JCPDS card No. 09-0043). As the voltage decreases, the new phases of LiGa and Li2Ga were formed at 25.2° and 22.7°, respectively (JCPDS cards No. 36-0934 and No. 31-0539) [14]. During the electrochemical charging process, the peak position of Li2Ga gradually disappeared and transformed into Li2Ga7, followed by EGaSn, indicating that the active material in the electrode returned to a liquid state after complete de-lithiation. Li x Sn phase was not detected in the XRD spectrum test results, which may be ascribed to that content of Sn is far below the detection limit. Besides, the electrochemical redox peaks in the CV curve indicated that Sn was also involved in the whole electrochemical alloying process. In summary, the EGaSn@PPy electrode undergoes a reversible “liquid-solid-liquid” transition process during the electrochemical process, and both Ga and Sn participate in the alloying process during the electrochemical cycle, which also keeps consistent with the reported literature [15]. The cycling performances of EGaSn@PPy and pure EGaSn anodes were evaluated at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 4d). After 100 cycles, the capacity of the EGaSn@PPy anode keeps 590.6 mAh g−1, which is higher than the pure EGaSn anode. The capacity of EGaSn occurs persistent attenuation from the 20th cycle. After 100 cycles, the capacity has reduced to 14.7 mAh g−1. The intuitive comparison results of the capacity difference between EGaSn@PPy and pure EGaSn anodes during the overall process are displayed in Fig. 4(e). Without the customized electrode design, the EGaSn anode exhibits a lower initial capacity and drastic decline after 20 cycles. The pure EGaSn electrode without any surface treatment is easy to fuse during the preparation of the slurry to form large particles, as shown in Fig. S8. Therefore, during the alloying stages, the EGaSn anode exhibits larger internal resistance and longer diffusion paths of lithium ions, incurring a lower utilization rate of active materials at the same current density [39]. Besides, the sudden failure of the electrode manifests that the lack of protection for EGaSn makes the new-formed nanoparticles pulverized and electro-detached. The initial capacity decay of EGaSn@PPy is due to the particles refinement and electrode activation [40]. After 20 cycles, the capacity of the EGaSn@PPy anode is nearly constant, which is related to the dispersed distribution of the formed secondary particles in the PPy coating layer after the initial volume expansion [41]. These results further illustrate the importance of the design of the conductive adhesion layer for the improvement of the stability and electrochemical performance of the liquid metal electrode. To evaluate the self-healing property of composite, the rate capability and long-term cycling performance were measured as the key characterization. The EGaSn@PPy anode exhibits excellent discharge capacities of 773, 675, 607, 462, and 350 mAh g−1 under the regularly changing current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4f). The pure EGaSn electrode exhibits specific capacities of 704, 386, 219, 121, and 55 mAh g−1 at the corresponding current densities as before. Afterward, as the current density falls to 0.1 A g−1, the discharge capacity of the EGaSn@PPy anode recovers to 705 mAh g−1, but the pure EGaSn anode only returns to 90 mAh g−1. The superior improvement is beneficial from the perfect realization of liquid metal features under the assistance of electrode design. The long-term cycling performance of the EGaSn@PPy anode was tested at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 4g). The anode exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 754.2 mAh g−1 with the Coulombic efficiency reach to 89.6%. After 500 cycles, the stable capacity of the anode is 499.8 mAh g−1 and the Coulombic efficiency maintains at 99.6%. The capacity decay in the first 60 cycles is mainly related to the rapid expansion and redispersion of liquid metal under the high current density. These excellent performances demonstrate this electrode design can effectively improve the electrochemical cycling performance and rate capability of the EGaSn. 3.3 Electrochemical reaction mechanism To further clarify the electrochemical mechanism and explore the detailed reason for improved electrochemical performance, the reaction kinetics of EGaSn and EGaSn@PPy anodes were evaluated by their impedance and the qualitative comparison of lithium-ion diffusion coefficient ( D Li + ). The Nyquist plots of EGaSn and EGaSn@PPy are shown in Fig. 5 (a and b), including the initial state, and the fully charged state after the 50th and 100th cycles. All plots are composed of a semicircle at a medium frequency and a straight line at low frequency, which represent the inherent resistance of the full battery (R s), the charge transfer resistance (R ct), and the Warburg resistance (Z w) [42]. Fig. S9 displays the equivalent circuit model. After appropriate fitting (Fig. S10), these exhaustive R ct values are summarized in Fig. 5(c). The comparison of the R ct shows that the impedance of two anodes at the 50th cycle is much higher than the initial state. This result signifies the elevated impedance after the electrochemical activation with the thickness of SEI film [43]. As the cycles raise, the impedance of EGaSn@PPy contains at nearly 130 Ω, but the EGaSn begins to enlarge. The obvious difference demonstrates that the EGaSn@PPy behaves with excellent stability and higher reaction kinetics benefiting from the integrated “dual-insurance” design. While the worse resistance increase of EGaSn is caused by the thicker SEI layer, which is related to the continuous exposure of new active materials surfaces and detachment of liquid metal. In addition, the overall impedance values of EGaSn@PPy are lower than EGaSn, exhibiting that the EGaSn@PPy has the better internal contact due to the effective structural design. More convincing, the D Li + of two anodes at the different states are qualitatively compared by Eq. (1). (1) D Li + = R 2 T 2 / 2 n 4 A 2 F 4 C 0 2 σ 2 (2) Z ' = R s + R ct + σ ω - 1 / 2 (3) ω = 2 π f In which R refers to the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n represents the electron number, A is the electrode surface area, F denotes the Faraday constant, C 0 refers to the concentration of Li-ion in the electrode, σ denotes the Warburg Factor, ω represents the angular frequency, and f is the frequency. Except for σ, the values of other parameters are already known and determined. As a result, the D Li + of two anodes can be qualitatively compared by the values of σ. To obtain their values, the linear fitting plots based on Eq. (2) are drawn and displayed in Fig. 5(d–f). Upon cycling, the slop of EGaSn and EGaSn@PPy anodes undergo an obvious decrease from 3471.86 to 381.04 Ω cm2 s−1/2, and from 699.84 to 77.32 Ω cm2 s−1/2, respectively. After 100 cycles, the EGaSn displays an increasing slop than the previous 50 cycles, representing the improved difficulty in lithium-ion diffusion with lower electron/ion conductivity. In contrast, the EGaSn@PPy exhibits a continuous reduction of slop. Correspondingly, the D Li + of EGaSn@PPy is positively correlated with the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction. As a result, the EGaSn@PPy behaves with enhanced kinetics, which is ascribed to the effective “dual-insurance” structure design. To further verify the superiority of the composite structure design in self-healing effect, the microscopic morphologies of cycled EGaSn and EGaSn@PPy anodes were observed by SEM. Obvious ruptures are observed in the cycled EGaSn electrode (the inset of Fig. S11). Simultaneously, many sub-liquid-metal (sub-LM) particles and delaminated active materials are formed on the electrode. These phenomena indicate that EGaSn without the surface protective layer tends to divide into many small particles caused by the volume expansion, leading to the deactivation of active materials and the destruction of the electrode. By contrast, the surface of the EGaSn@PPy anode is smooth and has no cracks. Moreover, the confined sub-LM particles are formed in the network (Fig. S12). Therefore, the outstanding electrochemical performance of the EGaSn@PPy anode is attributed to the stability of the designed conductive networks and the self-healing feature of EGaSn. First, the coating of PPy is the effective protection layer of EGaSn, which leads to the preservation of the self-healing and metallic features of EGaSn particles. Second, the conductive and adhesive network structure with the aid of PAA can not only accelerate the electron and ion transfer but also keep the favorable electrode integration during the repeated electrochemical process. Finally, the “dual-insurance” design ensures the EGaSn@PPy displays a promising electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries. 4 Conclusions In summary, a novel “dual-insurance” strategy is proposed to improve the self-healing effect of EGaSn as an anode for LIBs. The polypyrrole is first introduced onto the surface of the EGaSn nanoparticles by the traditional chemical oxidative polymerization method. Comprehensive measurements have revealed the detailed changes and the liquid properties of EGaSn during the synthetic process, which has also verified the successful preparation of the EGaSn@PPy composite. The PPy protection layer not only enables EGaSn to maintain its inherent self-healing effect but also endows the final electrode to keep superb integrity with high conductivity. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of electrode structural design, the EGaSn@PPy anode exhibits enhanced redox kinetics and a promising reversible capacity of 499.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1.

        "dc:description": "The gallium-based liquid metal as one of the self-healing materials has gained wide attention, especially in the energy storage system. However, volume expansion with the “liquid–solid-liquid” transformation process still leads to un-controlled electrode failure, which stimulates the irreversibility of liquid metal and hinders their self-healing effect as the anode for lithium-ion batteries. Herein, the polypyrrole (PPy) with highly conductive and adhesive features is first introduced to fasten the liquid metal nanoparticles (gallium-tin alloy, EGaSn) in the integrated electrode and applied as the anode for lithium-ion batteries. A tightly PPy wrapped EGaSn nanoparticles structure is formed during the in-situ polymerization synthesis process, which effectively avoids the detachment of solid alloyed products. Based on the features of PPy, polyacrylic acid is added to facilitate strengthening the integrity of the electrode by constructing the hydrogen bond. The “dual-insurance” design endows the EGaSn to exhibit superior electrochemical kinetics and an astonishing self-healing effect. As a result, the customized anode displays superior cycling stability (499.8 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1) and rate capability (350 mAh g−1 at 2.0 A g−1). This work enriches the electrode engineering technology of liquid metal nanoparticles and opens up a new way to customize the self-healing anode for lithium-ion batteries.",
