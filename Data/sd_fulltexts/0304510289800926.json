LAWRENCE*, PAUL A. SERMON Dept. of Chemistry, Brunei University, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH (U.K.) and IRENE FEINSTEIN-JAFFE** Dept. of Materials Research, Weismann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76000 (Israel) (Received April 13,1988; accepted December 5, 1988) Summary Three distinct types of active sites are proposed to account for the observed catalytic activity of the hexagonal and tetragonal structural modi- fications of rhodium(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride polymers in olefin hydrogenation reactions. The role of cooperative effects between adjacent rhodium centres in these catalysts is examined. Introduction The metal-ligand bond in rhodium(I) isocyanide complexes is a sum- mation of (i) a carbon to metal o-bond and (ii) a metal to carbon Tr-bond [l],e.g.: CH^Clz 4R-N^Ct + ^[Rh(CO)2Cl]2 ^ [R-N^CJ^Rh-'Cl-+ 2COt When the stereorigid, bifunctional ligand 4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl is used in the above reaction scheme, stable organometallic polymers are precipitated from solution as granular solids that contain one-dimensional chains of aligned rhodium(I) ions [2]. Tetragonal and hexagonal structural modifica- tions of this polymer have been prepared to date [3, 4] (Fig. l(a) and l(b)). Good overlap of metal d-orbitals with the ir* antibonding orbitals on the ligands in this complex extends electronic conjugation throughout the * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; present address: Develop- ment Dept., Johnson Matthey pic, Jeffries Road, Enfield, ENS 7PW (U.K.). **Present address: Israel Atomic Energy Commission, Soreq Nuclear Research Centre, Chemistry Division, Dept. of Radiopharmaceuticals, Yavne 70600 (Israel). 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 118 (a) (b) Fig. 1.

In addition to this type of electronic overlap, extended rhodium-rhodium interactions between adjacent metal centres have also been identified in the rhodium complexes here, conferring unusual anisotropic electrical and magnetic properties on this type of material [6, 7]. One problem associated with the study of these materials is how closely this one-dimensional interaction between adjacent rhodium ions resembles the three-dimensional interaction between atoms in the metallic state. Pauling's theory of the metallic state requires that 8.28 of a metal's outer orbital electrons are to be used in bonding, leaving 0.72 orbitals empty for unsynchronised resonances, which confer metallic properties on the material [8]. Unfortunately there are few reports in the literature on the application of Pauling's theory [9,10] to one-dimensional metals, but there is no reason why the theory cannot be extended to cover this type of material [11]. For the 4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl complexes of rhodium here, each of the four isocyanide ligands is able to act as a two-electron donor to a rhodium ion. In addition, if allowances are made for resonance hybridisation in the four metal-ligand bonds and for a percentage of covalent character in the Rh\"*\" Cl~ bond, it is entirely feasible that Pauling's critical figure of 8.28 orbitals can be attained [11]. Thus the rhodium-rhodium interactions here must have a percentage of metallic character. This result is important, because solid-state interactions of this kind may play a major role in defining the catalytic activity of these materials. In the present work, both hexagonal and tetragonal polymeric modi- fications of rhodium(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride have been examined for catalytic activity in cyclohexene dehydrogenation and alcohol decomposition reactions, and the results of these trials are evaluated in terms of existing theories of catalyst surface sites. 119 Results and discussion Unit cell dimensions determined from powder X-ray diffractometry for the rhodium polymers used here were: a = b = 30.16 A and c = 3.54 A for the hexagonal modification and a=b=15.15 A and c = 3.40 A for the tetragonal modification. Measurements of electrical resistivity showed the hexagonal and tetragonal modifications of the rhodium polymer to be semiconducting, with values of 1 X 107 Ohm cm and 5 X 105 Ohm cm respectively [6]. As the powder resistivity measured for the uncoordinated pure ligand is some 102 to 104 times greater than the resistivity found in the rhodium-containing polymers (resistivity of 4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl = 5.3 X 109 Ohm cm), the lower resistivities measured for the two polymers can only be attributed to: (i) back donation of electrons from the Rh(I) ions to the conjugated bridging ligand system, or (ii) interactions between orbitals on adjacent rhodium ions (4d^ 5p^, 5s) situated 3.54 A apart in the hexagonal polymer and 3.40 A apart in the tetragonal polymer. Results of IR and EPR spectroscopy reported in an earlier paper [6] have shown that in the solid state of both forms of polymer the net overall movement of electrons is away from the ligands towards the metal ions. This leaves proposal (ii) (i.e. partial metallic character in extended rhodium-rhodium interactions) as being the likely cause of the good elec- trical conductivity found in these materials. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for the tetragonal and hexagonal modifications of rhodium bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride are given in Fig. 2 and show initial uptakes of hydrogen at 196 and 344 C respectively, followed by decomposition at higher temperatures. 400 600 800 1000 T/K Fig. 2. TPR profiles of ( ) tetragonal and ( ) hexagonal Rh(I) bis-4,4'-diiso- cyanobiphenyl chloride polymers. 120 The first peak in the reduction profiles of both polymers is symmetrical and corresponds to the adsorption of 2.5 mol hydrogen per mol polymer (hexagonal or tetragonal). The observed ratio of 2.5 H;:! polymer unit, from TPR, is illustrated by the following reaction scheme and is thought to correspond to an initial oxidative addition of hydrogen onto Rh(I) centres (B) followed by loss of HC1, reduction of the isocyanide linkages (see Table 3) and breakdown of the polymer structure.

The proposal that hydrogen uptake occurs on the isocyanide carbons rather than on nitrogens is in agreement with reported work by Butler et al. [12] and Treichel et al. [13]. Reaction intermediate C, containing Rh(IV), would result from the simultaneous reduction of all four isocyanide linkages and is unlikely to be stable. The presence of Rh(I) and Rh(0) in D, the reac- tion product, has been confirmed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopic measurements (see Table 3). An observed colour change, from green (hexagonal) or brown (tetragonal) to black in the treated material, D, coupled with a sudden rise in electrical resistivity, is attributed to a break- down of the metal-metal chains and loss of conjugation in the ligands. Mercury porosimetric analysis carried out on the two modifications of the rhodium polymer used here showed both materials to possess an exten- sive mesopore structure with a modal pore radius of 16.4 nm. BET analysis confirmed the results of mercury porosimetry, and in addition revealed a 121 TABLE 1 Results of chemisorptio n experiments us ing rhodium aryl diis< scyanide polymers Sample T (K) Gas used Max. uptake (mol gas/mol sample) rhodium polymer 293 CO 0.038 (hexagonal) 293 293 333 N21 IT-2^2C^H^ 0.000 0.024 0.750 rhodium polymer 293 CO 0.355 (tetragonal) 293 CiH4 0.011 293 N2 0.000 333 C;2H4 0.507 3% Rh/SiO, 293 293 293 COi\"3C2H4 1.05 2.40 1.20 zeolite-like micropore structure within the materials at a pore radius of 1-2 nm. Values obtained for the internal and external surface areas of the two polymers from BET analysis were as follows: Hexagonal rhodium polymer total surface area = 151.2 m2 g~1, external surface area = 117.5 m2 g~1; Tetragonal rhodium polymer total surface area = 153.9 m2 g~1, external surface area = 130.0 m2 g~1. The values for BET external surface area do not include a contribution from the micropore structure; the values for the total surface area include the internal surface area of the micropores. The presence of a pore structure at a pore radius of 16.4 nm is puzzling, and as yet can only be accounted for in terms of periodic rearrangements of the unit cell stacking. Results obtained from experimental measurement of the chemisorption of N3, Hz, CO and CyH^ onto degassed samples of the rhodium polymers are given in Table 1. Prior to chemisorption, samples of the polymer were outgassed at 150 C and 10~5 mmHg for 20 h to remove any water and terminal ligand linkages from the surface of the polymer. ^^\\ __^Kh^ ^ \\^ ^ liinilll = columnar metal chain = bridging diisocyanide linkages L = external surface terminating diisocyanide ligand bonded only at one end. 122 TABLE 2 Apparent turnover numbers for cyclohexene hydrogenation Sample Apparent turnover number (mol CeHio (mol Rh)\"1 s-1) 20 C 90 C rhodium polymer (hexagonal) 5.7 X10-3 1.1 X10-2 rhodium polymer (tetragonal) 2.6 X ICT3 (Rh(CN-C(,H4-CH3)4)C104 a (^(^-(CH^e-NC^CIO^ 0.00 5.33 X 10~4 0.00 5.33 X 10-4 3% Rh/SiOz 0.371 1.102 Surface area not determined. A 3% rhodium-on-silica catalyst was also used in these trials to examine the availability of surface rhodium centres. From Table 1 it is seen that the values obtained for chemisorption on the rhodium polymers all fall short of monolayer coverage (if 100% of all of the Rh(I) ions were available), which indicates there are at the very least two different types of surface rhodium centres present on these materials. The two structural forms of rhodium bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride polymer showed moderate activity in alcohol decomposition and olefin hydrogenation trials carried out in this investigation. Apparent turn- over numbers for a number of rhodium-containing catalyst systems for the cyclohexene reaction, determined at 20 and 90 C, calculated for the total number of rhodium atoms or ions present, are given in Table 2. At temperatures in excess of 90 C, the rhodium polymers (hexagonal and tetragonal) lost all activity and became inert to further pretreatment. X-ray photoelectron spectra of samples of the deactivated catalysts showed a shift in the rhodium peaks to a lower binding energy, indicating that reduction had taken place. It has already been shown that at temperatures in excess of 95 C cyclohexene begins to dehydrogenate to benzene over metals, instead of undergoing hydrogenation [14]. It is thought that at tem- peratures in excess of 90 C cyclohexene dehydrogenation acts to release hydrogen at active sites on the catalyst surface, which then binds to the rhodium centres. Recent work on the temperature of the active sites on inert supports [14] has shown that, in cyclohexene dehydrogenation, the active metal sites on a catalyst surface are at a much higher temperature than the bulk temperature of the support. It is feasible that for the rhodium organometallic polymers here temperatures of 250 C could be generated for short periods at reaction centres, which would make the formation of 123 hydrides possible. However, at present, the exact deactivation mechanism of these catalysts remains unclear. Samples of the hexagonal rhodium polymer held in the cyclohexene reactor but exposed to ci's-pent-2-ene vapour gave no hydrogenation activity, but did show a time-dependent catalytic activity for isomerization to trans-pent-2-ene; however, the turnover numbers were too low to be measured with any degree of accuracy (less than 1 X 10~3). A mechanistic scheme of catalytic activity in olefin hydrogenation/isomerisation reactions by which these polymers might operate has been proposed by Jaffe and Efraty [5]. Both forms of rhodium bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride were found to be active in methanol decomposition, with the tetragonal form being identified as the more active of the two (at 600 K, 1 X 10~3 mol Hz (g catalyst)\"1 min~1). Hydrogen was identified as the major reaction product together with carbon monoxide. When the reaction was repeated with iso- propanol instead of methanol the hexagonal polymer showed negligible activity, but the tetragonal polymer gave moderate conversion to acetone at 150 C and at higher temperatures showed some selectivity to propene formation. Siegel et al. [15] identified three types of coordinatively unsaturated sites on metal surfaces, classified as 3M, ^ and ^ centres. Augustine and Warner [16], from a study of the known mechanisms of several organo- metallic catalysts, attributed 3^! sites as being responsible for hydrogenation in hydrocarbon reactions, ^ sites as being responsible for isomerisation in the same sort of reaction, and 'M sites as being inactive. Augustine and Warners' approach is especially suited for application to the polymeric catalysts here, as these materials closely resemble to organometallic catalysts upon which their assignments were based [17]. From the results of the experimental work reported here, there is evidence to suggest that there are several different rhodium sites present on the surface of the polymers (i.e. less than 100% coverage of available sites in Ha chemisorption, different reaction products from alcohol decomposition, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene but selective isomerisation of pent-2-ene). Using simple geometric models of the structures of the two polymers (Figs. l(a) and l(b)), it is possible to identify three catalytically active sites that correspond to the three sites described by Siegel et al. [15]. These active sites are thought to be (i) chain-end rhodium sites ^M); (ii) in-chain rhodium sites ('^'M); and (iii) rhodium sites on the (001) face of the material (^) (see Fig. 3). Apparent turnover numbers for the cyclo- hexene hydrogenation reaction (Table 2), based on the total number of Rh(I) ions present, show the activity of the hexagonal rhodium polymer to be roughly one hundred times less than the activity of 3% rhodium-on- silica in this reaction. In addition, chemisorption data (Table 1) show that approximately 100% of the rhodium atoms in the 3% rhodium-on-silica catalyst are accessible for hydrogenation; therefore if such centres are solely responsible for hydrogenation here, then less than 1% of the rhodium 124 Fig. 3. Active sites in Rh(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride polymers; (a) 001 face edge Rh site, potential ^ site (possibly even *M site); (b) external face, internal Rh ion in a potential ^ site; (c) internal face, internal Rh atom, potential ^ site. contained in the hexagonal form of the rhodium polymer is active in cyclo- hexene hydrogenation. This result agrees with a previously reported theo- retical model of the active sites present in these polymers [5]. As the majority of Rh(I) ions in the matrices of both polymer modifica- tions occupy 'M sites, cooperative effects between adjacent ^ sites might be expected here to result in high turnover numbers for olefin isomerization reactions. (A cooperative effect in this instance would be the transfer of an activated atom or molecule from one rhodium centre to the next nearest rhodium centre 3.40 A or 3.52 A away, for the tetragonal and hexagonal structural modifications respectively.) However, turnover numbers measured for the cis-pent-2-ene isomerization reactions are low. This result can only be rationalised if cooperative effects between ^ sites are absent in these polymers. The cyclohexene hydrogenation turnover numbers mea- sured for the two Rh(I) complexes [Rh(CN (CH2)6 NC)2]C104 and [Rh(CN C6H4 CH3)4]C104, where steric factors completely rule out the possibility of cooperative effects are, however, significantly lower than the values measured for the rhodium polymers. Given this, it is possible that the higher apparent turnover numbers measured for the rhodium polymers may result in part from cooperative effects between ^ and ^M centres and/or adjacent 2^! centres. Bond [18] gives the order of chemisorption affinity for various gases on Group VIII metals as being: C>2 > C2H:4 > CO > H2 > C02 > N2. However, for both modifications of the rhodium polymer here the observed order of affinity was found to be: C2H4 > H2 > CO > N2 02 0.0. 125 TABLES X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of Rh(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride polymers Sample Binding energy (eV) Comments 3d5/2 3d3/2 hexagonal modification 309.2 314.0 \\ confirms the presence tetragonal modification 309.6 314.3 j of Rh( I) in these materials polymer after exposure 309.9 313.8 (two doublets observed to hydrogen at 340 C 307.7 312.2 \\ attributed to Rh(I) and (Rh(0) rhodium metal 307.8 312.4 comparative value The order C2H4> CO is common to both series, indicating that both rhodium metal and Rh(I) in these complexes have good affinity for unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds (the observation that Hz > CO is best explained by the fact that a higher proportion of the polymer internal surface area is accessible to the small H; molecule). However, it is the apparent low affinity of Rh(I) in these polymers for oxygen which is intriguing, as Rh(I) ions in other chemical systems have been shown to possess good oxygen affinities [19]. It is hard to define the precise oxidation state of metals contained in aryl diisocyanide polymers [6]. From Table 3, the binding energies of the 3d5/2 and Sda/z peaks are not the same for both structural forms of the rhodium polymer here, and indicate that the rhodium ions contained in the tetragonal polymer are slightly more oxidised than the rhodium ions contained in the hexagonal polymer. Possibly variations in the surface electrical charges found on these complexes at the rhodium centres serve in some way to inhibit the chemisorption of molecular oxygen. These findings may have implications for the use of this class of organometallic polymers as fuel cell electrodes [20]. This represents an exciting area for further work. Conclusions Using a simple model, three distinct types of surface sites have been proposed to account for the observed catalytic activity of the tetragonal and hexagonal structural modifications of rhodium(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobi- phenyl chloride polymers. Results of electrical conductivity measurements show both forms of polymer to be semiconducting, with electrical con- ductivity arising from extended rhodium-rhodium interactions in the solid state as predicted by application of Pauling's valence bond theory to these materials. Results of olefin hydrogenation and alcohol decomposition experi- 126 ments have failed to show any evidence of cooperative effects between adjacent ^ rhodium sites, but cooperative effects between adjacent ^M sites and also between adjacent ^ and ^ sites are thought to be likely. Co- operative effects of this kind would account for the observed activity of these polymers in cyclohexene hydrogenation reactions. However, the mechanisms by which cooperative effects of this type might take place in these polymers remains to be determined. Experimental The hexagonal and tetragonal structural modifications of rhodium bis- 4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride were prepared according to literature methods [3,4], as were the complexes [Rh(CN C6H4 CH3)4]C104 [21] and [Rh(CN (CH2)6 NC)2]C104 [21]. Samples of 3% (by mass) rhodium metal supported on silica were prepared by reduction (200 C, 3 h in H;) of silica impregnated with an aqueous solution of Rh(III) chloride. Analysis of surface area and porosity on the polymers was done by mercury porosimetry (Carlo Erba Porosimeter 2000) and BET N3 adsorption (Carlo Erba Sorpto- matic 1800). Measurements of electrical conductivity were made on samples using a low-pressure conductivity cell fitted with aluminium disc electrodes [22]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kratos ES300 with Al radiation at 1468.6 eV) was used to determine the binding energies and oxidation states of rhodium ions in the complexes prepared. Evaluations of catalytic activity were done using equipment described in the literature [14] using partial pressures of cyclohexene of 25 mmHg and cis-pent-2-ene of 150 mmHg. Measurements of the activity of catalysts in alcohol decomposition reactions were done with a saturated vapour of methanol or isopropanol at 0 C which was passed through a catalyst sample (0.1 g in a silica reactor held in a furnace temperature-programmed from 20 to 500 C at 5 C min\"1). Before reaction, samples were pretreated for 20 min at 150 C in dry ni- trogen. Acknowledgements S. A.

Three distinct types of active sites are proposed to account for the observed catalytic activity of the hexagonal and tetragonal structural modifications of rhodium(I) bis-4,4'-diisocyanobiphenyl chloride polymers in olefin hydrogenation reactions. The role of cooperative effects between adjacent rhodium centres in these catalysts is examined. References 1 W. Gordy L. Pauling J. Am. Chem. Soc. 64 1942 2952 2 A. Efraty I. Feinstein L.
