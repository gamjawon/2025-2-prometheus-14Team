Electrocatalysis is essential in the conversion of chemicals to electrical energy. The search for high-performance electrocatalysts is particularly important in the context of numerous renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, capable of addressing energy and environmental concerns. Electrocatalysis is used in advanced renewable energy conversion and storage technologies, such as carbon dioxide and water electrolyzers, fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc. For instance, the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a green technology that can convert intermittent renewable energy sources (such as solar energy and wind energy) into fuels and valuable chemicals. Similarly, water electrocatalysis produces green and renewable fuel (hydrogen), which will not cause harm to environment. The recent decade has witnessed new ideas, materials, methods, and applications fueling its rapid growth. Although tremendous progress has been made in electrolysis for energy and the environment, these energy technologies still face the major problem of service level and long-term durability in practical conditions, which hinders commercialization and further implementation in large-scale application. The concept of electrocatalysis for sustainable energy envisions the opportunity to highlight current achievements of electrocatalytic materials and methods for energy and environmental technologies. Atomic-scale study of electrocatalytic activities, monitoring degradation pathways, and determining eventual solutions are critical for long-lasting systems. This issue includes the below listed and associated topics: i) Structural and interfacial engineering of well-defined electrocatalysts for optimized electrochemical CO2RR, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) etc. ii) geometric and composition changes of Pt alloys and their significance towards durable PEM fuel cells. iii) reaction mechanism studies for triggering active sites and enhancing electrocatalytic performance. iv) N-doped carbon materials integrated with PGM free catalyst for water splitting. This special issue includes 15 publications by scientists and researchers, including six review papers, eight research papers, and one communication paper. As guest editors, we would like to thank all contributors for their outstanding contributions. We also appreciate the editorial staffs of Chin. J. Catal. for their great support and efforts on this special issue. We hope this collection will serve the electrocatalysis community and contribute to the development of sustainable future.",
