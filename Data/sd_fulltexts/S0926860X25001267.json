VMOF derived VOx/Al2O3 millimeter spherical catalysts were prepared using MIL-100(V) as precursor by gum arabic-assisted sol-gel and N2-air dual calcination method, and the effects of preparation method and V loading of catalyst on the properties of VOx/Al2O3 and propane dehydrogenation performance were investigated systematically. The as-prepared spherical catalyst exhibited a watermelon-seed-like structure with VMOF derived VOx as seeds, and isolated VOx species with good dispersion could be achieved even at a higher vanadium loading owing to the isolation effects of organic ligands of MOF and alumina support. The hierarchical porous structure with mesopores of alumina and micro-scale rod-like pores left by the decomposition of MIL-100(V) through N2-air dual calcination could be created. Besides, weaker interaction between VOx derived from MOF and alumina is beneficial for increasing the amount of reducible isolated species and decreasing strong acid site amount. 7.4VOx/Al2O3 presented the highest catalytic performance with propane conversion of 30.8 %/28.2 % (initial/final) and propylene selectivity of 91.6 %/94.7 % (initial/final) within 5.25 h reaction due to the good dispersion of VOx species, hierarchical porous structure and moderate amount of surface acid sites. The high stability and excellent reaction-regeneration cycle performance of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 offered a great potential for the industrial application of vanadium-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as a process specialized in the production of propylene, is considered to be one of the cleanest and most efficient methods and has been widely researched and developed in recent years [1,2]. Honeywell UOP's Oleflex process and ABB Lummus' Catofin process have been commercialized, using Pt-based and Cr-based catalysts, respectively [3]. However, Pt is expensive, and Cr can cause serious pollution to the environment, both of which pose certain economic and environmental problems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop economically and environmentally friendly alternative catalysts. Non-precious metal oxides, such as supported VOx, CoOx, ZnOx, SnOx, NiOx, GaOx, etc., have shown considerable catalytic activity and propylene selectivity for PDH reactions [4,5]. Especially for VOx based catalysts, the propylene yield and selectivity can reach over 20 % and 90 %, respectively, and they have better regeneration cycle stability, which makes VOx based catalysts one of the most promising catalysts to replace Pt-based and Cr-based catalysts [6]. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the activity is greatly affected by the support properties, vanadium species dispersion and chemical state. Depending on the support type, V loading, catalyst preparation methods and conditions, the VOx species can exist in the form of V5 +, V4+, V3+, isolated VOx, oligomeric VOx, crystalline V2O5, and so on [7,8]. The active sites for propane dehydrogenation in V-based catalysts are still controversial, whereas the prevailing views are that VOx species with V3+ and V4+ are the main active sites. Liu et al. [9] demonstrated by means of in situ IR that oligomeric V3+ and V4+ are the sites with the highest propane dehydrogenation activity, especially V3+ possessing better activity than V4+, while V5+ has no dehydrogenation activity. The vanadium loading and catalyst preparation method can significantly affect the chemical state of V species and the content of V3+ species as main active site in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and thus influence the catalytic activity in PDH. Lack of stability is a crucial problem for V-based catalysts that remains to be solved. The “active site isolation” strategies by separating active sites or anchoring the active species on the support have been proved to be effective ways for improving catalyst stability and selectivity [7–10]. In recent years, the catalyst preparation with “active site isolation” using metal-organic framework (MOF) materials as precursors has attracted much attention. MOF is a porous material formed by self-assembly of inorganic metal nodes and organic ligands, whose metal nodes are separated by the ligands, which provides a natural basis for obtaining highly dispersed metal active centers. At the same time, the framework structure can inhibit the migration of active centers, and the cavity formed also provides a favorable channel for the diffusion of reactants and products. However, the thermal and water stability of MOF materials is poor, especially under the high temperature reaction conditions such as PDH, which is easy to cause the collapse of the pore structure, thus destroying the catalyst structure. Nevertheless, the carbon coated material obtained by pyrolysis carbonization of MOF under vacuum or inert atmosphere can greatly retain the structure of the original MOF material, which guides the direction of the structural design of new PDH catalysts. Wang et al. [11] obtained isolated cobalt oxide sites (CoOx@NC/S-1) within the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer by volatilizing a Zn/Co bimetallic zeolite imidazolium skeleton (ZIF) loaded on silicalite-1 zeolite and removing the Zn species along with pyrolysis carbonization followed by oxidation in air at 300 °C. The results showed that the addition of Zn species acted as a \"fencing\" effect, increasing the distance between neighboring CoOx, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species at the nanoscale, and the catalyst presented excellent PDH performance. Hu et al. [12] presented direct evidence for the construction of isolated Co-motifs within the purely siliceous MFI zeolite. The isolated Co-based active motifs with the distorted tetrahedral structure were homogeneously embedded into the specific sites of MFI zeolites, collectively participating in promoting propane activation and dehydrogenation and leading to the highly efficient conversion. Sarazen et al. [13] pyrolyzed iron-containing metal-organic skeletons under N2 atmosphere to form FeC catalysts for the PDH reaction, and the selectivity of propylene could be stabilized at about 80 % for more than 48 hours. It is noteworthy that carbon-based catalysts cannot be regenerated by high-temperature calcination after carbon deposition deactivation, which limits their application in industrial processes. Therefore, the carbon needs to be removed from MOF derived carbon-based catalysts by aerobic high-temperature calcination, while the dispersed active sites may undergo secondary aggregation without the separation of supports. Introducing MOF into supports is expected to solve this problem. In addition, powder catalysts cannot be directly used in industrial applications. Millimeter sized catalysts, such as spherical, strip-shaped, anisotropic, etc., are necessary for catalysts to fit the reaction environment. Especially, the moving bed reactor for PDH requires the use of spherical catalysts with high roundness, good strength, and low surface wear. Therefore, the powder form of MOF derived catalysts limits their large-scale applications, and MOF shaping has become an important research topic. In our previous work, millimeter-size γ-Al2O3 beads (1.8 mm) were prepared by alginate assisted sol-gel method [14], and were used as supports modified by in situ growth of layered double hydrotalcites and acid etching, which could promote the dispersion of active components and improve the performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [15,16]. Moreover, MOF derived catalysts are mainly used in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, while their application in the field of thermal catalysis is still in the exploratory stage. It has been reported that Zr-based MOF loading VOx could be used as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation at relatively low reaction temperatures [17]. In view of the analysis above, if the VMOF material is introduced during the shaping process of spherical alumina support, the \"watermelon seed-like\" structure will be formed, in which VMOF as seeds will be dispersed in millimeter-size gel beads containing alumina gel and polysaccharide shaping excipient. After carbonization and aerobic calcination of for these gel beads, VMOF derived VOx/Al2O3 millimeter spherical catalysts can be obtained. Herein, inspired by the analysis above, MIL-100 (V) [18] was synthesized in this study, and a highly stable spherical vanadium-based catalyst was successfully synthesized using MIL-100(V) as the precursor by gum arabic-assisted sol-gel method and N2-air two-step calcination. VMOF derived VOx/Al2O3 millimeter spherical catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, TEM, XPS, H2-TPD, NH3-TPD, Raman spectra, UV–vis spectra and TG, and the effects of preparation method and V loading on the properties of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts and propane dehydrogenation performance were studied. Considering the consistency of preparation method, hybrid catalyst (VOx/Al2O3-H) as control catalyst was prepared by replacing MIL-100(V) powder with NH4VO3 in gum arabic-assisted sol-gel method. Compared to the VOx/Al2O3-H catalysts, VOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by impregnating spherical alumina beads with NH4VO3 solution presented a very low catalytic activity and stability, and the conversion of propane decreased from 25 % to 10 % within 5 h. This result was in agreement with the report by Wang et. al. that the catalysts synthesized by the one-pot method (adding Al(NO3)3 solution into NH4VO3 solution) exhibited higher catalytic performance and stability than those prepared by the impregnation method [19]. The catalyst preparation method used in this article can also be considered as a one-pot method. Therefore, impregnated catalysts were not selected as control catalysts in this work. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of VOx/Al2O3 millimeter sized spherical catalysts The VOx/Al2O3 millimeter sized spherical catalyst was prepared by gum arabic-assisted sol-gel and N2-air two-step calcination method, as presented in Scheme 1. In a typical process, 2 ml of 2 wt% nitric acid solution and 9 ml deionized water were added to 5 g of Pseudo-boehmite powder (PB) and stirred for 1 h to get an acidic aluminum sol, and then the pH of the sol was adjusted to 7 by adding aqueous ammonia to obtain aluminum gel. After that, 17 g of 3 wt% gum arabic solution, and xg MIL-100(V) powder (x = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 or 2.0 g) were added to aluminum gel prepared above and mixed evenly by a high-speed homogenizer to obtain a suspension solution. The suspension solution was dropped into an oil-water column (upper white oil and below 0.2 M aluminum nitrate solution) with a syringe, and spherical wet beads were formed instantaneously due to the chelating reaction between Al3+ and gum arabic. After being aged for 30 min in 0.2 M aluminum nitrate solution, the spherical wet beads were filtered out and dried at 45 °C for 24 h to obtain the uncalcined sample, which was labeled as VMOF/AlOOH. The VMOF/AlOOH sample was calcined at 450 ℃ for 2 h under a nitrogen flow rate of 15 ml/min using a tube furnace, with a heating rate of 2 ℃/min, to obtain the carbonized sample labeled as V@C/Al2O3. The carbonized sample was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined in an air atmosphere to remove carbon at 600 ℃ for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 ℃/min to get the VOx-based catalyst, which was marked as yVOx/Al2O3, y is the vanadium content in the catalyst measured by ICP-OES, which is 2.5 wt%, 5.7 wt%, 7.4 wt%, 9.2 wt% and 10.8 wt%, corresponding to the MIL-100(V) powder addition amount of 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 g, respectively. Correspondingly, the uncalcined samples and carbonized samples were labeled as yVMOF/AlOOH and yV@C/Al2O3, respectively. The yVOx/Al2O3 spherical catalysts after one reaction cycle were denoted as yVOx/Al2O3-used. The catalysts after regeneration were denoted as yVOx/Al2O3-regn, while n refers to the regeneration times. Specifically, the used catalysts were sequentially purged with a nitrogen flow rate of 10 ml/min at 600 ℃ for 30 min, and then calcined under an air flow rate of 10 ml/min at 600 ℃ for 30 min. After that, these oxidized catalysts were cooled down to ambient temperature in 10 ml/min of nitrogen atmosphere to get regenerated catalysts. In addition, the 7.4VMOF/AlOOH sample calcined directly in an air atmosphere was named 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600. By replacing MIL-100(V) with NH4VO3, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H catalyst was prepared as a control sample, where 7.2 refers to the loading of V wt%. 7.4VOx/Al2O3 reduced with a hydrogen flow rate of 25 ml/min for 1 h at 600°C was labeled as 7.4VOx/Al2O3-H2, while the reduced 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H was named 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H-H2. The preparation of MIL-100(V) and alumina spherical beads was shown in S1.2 and S1.3 in detail, and XRD pattern of MIL-100(V) was presented in Fig. S1. 2.2 Catalysts characterization and test The details were shown in the Supplementary Material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and structure of samples As shown in Scheme 1, the VMOF/AlOOH catalyst is yellow-green spherical beads with a diameter of ∼1.7 mm, which is the same as the color of MIL-100(V). After pyrolysis carbonization of VMOF/AlOOH in N2 atmosphere at 450 °C, the MIL-100(V) particles were transformed into metal oxides wrapped by carbon materials, and black V@C/Al2O3 beads were obtained. After the calcination in an air atmosphere at 600 °C, the millimeter-sized spherical catalyst VOx/Al2O3 is prepared, which presents a golden-yellow appearance with a particle size of ∼1.6 mm. Notably, the sample prepared at each step shows a “watermelon seed-like” structure, where VMOF, V@C and VOx as seeds are isolated by alumina. This is in favor of improving the dispersion of VOx and decreasing the interaction between VOx and alumina. In addition, pyrolysis carbonization of VMOF and the following removal of carbon will generate micrometer sized macropores, making the formation of a hierarchical porous structure in spherical alumina, which is characterized by macropores with extending mesoporous channels. The good dispersion of V and hierarchical porous structure can enhance the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. SEM images of samples are shown in Fig. 1. MIL-100(V) displays a typical nanorods structure (NRs) of 1–3 μm length, which is consistent with the report in the literature [18]. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 1 that VMOF is embedded in boehmite flakes in the VMOF/AlOOH sample. After the carbonization under N2 flow, MIL-100(V) is converted to V@C with significant shrinkage in size (1–2 μm), which is trapped in Al2O3. V@C/Al2O3 is further calcined in an air atmosphere to remove the carbon species in the sample, leaving rod-like pores with 1–2 μm length in yVOx/Al2O3, as shown in Fig. 1d-f. With the increase of MIL-100(V) content, the amount of rod-like pores also increases. In addition, the rod-like pore size of 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 without carbonization process is much larger due to the collapse of pore structure and dehydration shrinkage of AlOOH during high temperature calcination. In contrast to the samples above, the blank supports (Al2O3 spherical beads) and hybrid catalysts (7.2VOx/Al2O3-H) exhibit morphologies of tightly packed particles, and no macropore can be observed. In order to further investigate the distribution of vanadium element within the catalyst, SEM EDS mapping tests are performed. As shown in Fig. S2, vanadium is distributed uniformly in support, and no large particle VOx can be detected, indicating the well dispersion of V species. The V concentration on the pore walls left by MOF decomposition in 7.4VOx/Al2O3 is higher than that of other position, showing V distributed on the pore walls. The V appearing at the other place of alumina can be due to the fracture of VMOF into smaller particle or destroy of MOF structure during the preparation. These SEM and EDS mapping results further confirm the watermelon seed-like structure and hierarchical pore structure of the catalyst as shown in Scheme 1. The crushing strength and roundness of the samples were tested, and the results are shown in Table S1. Spherical catalysts with a crushing strength of more than 25 N are generally considered to meet the requirements for fixed bed. Meanwhile, the higher roundness of the spherical catalyst, the more favorable increase in mass transfer efficiency and reaction performance. It can be seen from Table S1 that with the increase of MIL-100(V) content, the roundness and the crushing strength of the spherical catalyst decrease continuously. When the content of vanadium reaches 9.2 wt%, the crushing strength of the catalyst is less than 25 N/Bead and cannot meet the industrial requirements. Compared to 7.4 VOx/Al2O3, 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 has lower crushing strength due to its larger rod-like pores. Moreover, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H exhibits rather low crushing strength because the strong interaction between NH4VO3 and PB weakens the interaction between AlOOH particles. XRD results of the samples are shown in Fig. S3. For 7.4VMOF/AlOOH sample, characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to the (020), (120), (031) and (200) planes of pseudo-boehmite (PDF#21–1307) are detected, but no VMOF phase can be found. This can be due to the low content and high dispersion of VMOF. 7.4V@C/Al2O3 and yVOx/Al2O3 samples only show diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 37.60°, 45.86° and 67.03°, which can be ascribed to (311), (400) and (440) planes of γ-alumina (PDF#00–29–0063). No VOx species can be detected due to the relatively low loading amount and high dispersion. The specific surface area and pore structure of the samples were determined through N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. As shown in Fig. S4a, all V-based catalysts exhibit the characteristics of type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops, confirming the presence of abundant mesoporous structure. The hysteresis loops begin to appear at a high relative pressure (P/P0), illustrating a larger pore size of catalyst. Based on N2 adsorption-desorption data, the mesopore size distribution of samples was calculated using the BJH method and shown in Fig. S4b. It can be seen clearly that all VOx/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit two peaks at around 4 nm and 12 nm, and the peak intensity at around 4 nm increases gradually and peak at 12 nm becomes narrow with the increase of V loading from 2.5 % to 10.8 %, demonstrating the increase of small pores around 4 nm and the narrower distribution of larger pores around 12 nm. This phenomenon can be related to the increasing volatile gases produced by the decomposition of ligands and carbon combustion, which can help to create more small pores. Compared with 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H shows almost the same pore size distribution curve due to the similar preparation method, illustrating the similar pore structure between these two catalysts in the nanometer range. However, for 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 catalyst, the first peak becomes obviously strong and shifts towards small size direction, and the second peak weakens significantly, which suggests that the larger pores are transformed to smaller pores due to the collapse and blockage of the pore structure. This can be because direct calcination in air at 600 ℃ causes the quick removal of ligands and leaves a cavity in alumina, leading to the shrinkage of boehmite and the collapse of the cavity. When firstly calcined under N2 flow, VMOF only decomposes partly, and cavity can not be formed. At this stage, dehydration and shrinkage of PB processes have been completed, and PB is converted into γ-Al2O3, while the second calcination in air at 600 ℃ can not lead to the collapse of the cavity. The BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of these samples, calculated from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, are summarized in Table 1. The specific surface area of the synthesized MIL-100(V) is very low, consistent with that reported in the previous paper [18]. For yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts, the specific surface areas are close to 130 m2/g, while 7.4VOx/Al2O3 possesses larger pore volume. The carbonization and combustion of MOF could increase the pore volume of catalysts. However, the pore blocking caused by the increase of VOx is dominant for the catalysts with higher V content (9.2 wt% and 10.8 wt%), leading to the decline of pore volume. Correspondingly, the average pore size of the catalyst reduces as the VOx amount increases, agreeing with pore size distribution curves. 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H shows much smaller pore volume when compared to 7.4VOx/Al2O3 due to the lack of contribution from MOF carbonization and combustion. Furthermore, 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 possesses relatively smaller pore size, but larger specific surface area due to the transformation of larger pores to smaller pores during the rapid dehydration and shrinkage of boehmite in air at 600 ℃. 3.2 Chemical state of vanadium species The surface V densities were calculated by combining the V loading and the specific surface area of catalysts, which were listed in the last column of Table 1. According to the previous paper [20], the isolated VOx species will be predominant at a V surface density below 1.2 V/nm2, polymerized VOx coexists with monovanadates at V surface densities of 1.2–4.4 V/nm2, V2O5 forms at a surface VOx density beyond 4.4 V/nm2, and bulk V2O5 nanoparticles originate at VOx density > 8 V/nm2. Based on the data above, highly dispersed monovanadates are considered to be predominant in 2.5VOx/Al2O3. When the vanadium content reaches 5.7 wt% and 7.4 wt%, the V2O5 nanoparticles gradually appear. Further increasing of vanadium content to 9.2 wt% and 10.8 wt% promotes the formation of bulk V2O5 crystals. Since alumina exhibits very weak Raman peaks in the range of 1100 ∼ 100 cm−1, the existence form of VOx can be identified by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of all the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2a. Generally, Raman bands at ∼1020 cm−1 and ∼942 cm−1 are characteristic of isolated monovanadate species in tetrahedral coordination and oligomerization species V-O-V, respectively [21]. The presence of bulk V2O5 crystallites can be characterized by Raman bands at 994, 700, 530, 488, 408, 307, 285, 194, and 144 cm−1 [21]. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that no significant Raman band appears in 2.5VOx/Al2O3, indicating that 2.5VOx/Al2O3 presents highly dispersed monovanadate, which is consistent with the analysis of vanadium density. As the vanadium content of yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts grows, the intensity of Raman peaks increases. Raman peaks for bulk V2O5 crystallites are enhanced due to the increase of surface V densities. However, Raman bands at 1020 cm−1 remain for catalysts with high V loading, including 9.2VOx/Al2O3 (8.28 V/nm2) and 10.8VOx/Al2O3 (9.57 V/nm2), which are different from the result of Wu et al. [20] that Raman band at 1020 cm−1 becomes very weak for catalysts with vanadium density higher than 8 V/nm2. Furthermore, Chen et al. [22] reported that Raman band at 1020 cm−1 decreased gradually as the V loading increased from 3 wt% to 10 wt%. Whereas Raman band at 1020 cm−1 for yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts becomes more apparent with the increasing V content from 2.5 wt% to 10.8 wt%, illustrating that the isolated monovanadate species increase gradually with the increase of V loading in spite of the formation of V2O5 crystallites. Moreover, no Raman band at 1020 cm–1 for 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H can be found. The results indicate that the separation effects of MOF organic ligands and the support alumina improve the dispersion of vanadium species and more isolated species could be maintained in catalysts with higher vanadium content. In addition, 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 and 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H present a new Raman band at ∼905 cm−1, which corresponds to the characteristic vibration of V-O-Al bond [20]. It was demonstrated that there is relatively stronger chemical interaction between VOx and the alumina support for 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 and 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H samples, which promotes the formation of the AlVO4 phase. Furthermore, the VOx species on different catalysts were characterized by UV–vis DRS, as presented in Fig. 2b. The absorbance band at 200–280 nm is attributed to isolated vanadium species and low-polymerized VOx species with tetrahedral coordination. The absorbance band between 280 and 410 nm corresponds to high-polymerized VOx species with tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. Besides, the absorbance band at 410–540 nm is ascribed to highly polymerized VOx species (V2O5-like species) with octahedral coordination [23,24]. The 2.5VOx/Al2O3 sample only presents a very weak absorbance band at 240 nm, indicating that it predominantly contains highly dispersed monomeric VOx species. With the increase of vanadium amount, the absorbance band at 410 nm becomes more intense and shifts towards the long wavelength direction, demonstrating the formation of highly polymerized VOx species. It is worth mentioning that the absorbance band for the catalyst at 200–280 nm is enhanced even at a relatively high loading of vanadium, showing the increasing amount of isolated VOx species, which is consistent with results from Raman spectroscopy. In comparison with 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst has a much stronger absorbance band at 200–280 nm, indicating more isolated VOx species. Besides, no band above 540 nm, which is related to the characterization of the d-d transitions of V4+ and V3+, can be observed, illustrating the absence of these species in the catalysts with oxidation state [23,25]. The bandgap energies (Eg) of catalysts were shown in Table S2. These values were calculated by Tauc plot method to estimate the polymerization degree of the VOx species [26]. As the content of vanadium increases, the Eg values of the yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts gradually decrease, indicating an increase in VOx species polymerization [27]. In comparison with 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 with relatively high Eg value shows a better dispersion of VOx. In order to further explore the valence distribution of surface VOx species, XPS spectra measurements were carried out on fresh catalysts, reduced catalysts and used catalysts. The results are shown in Fig. S5 and Table 2. As shown in Table 2, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 possesses higher V4+ content compared to other yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts and 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H, leading to more V3+ species of the corresponding reduced samples. In addition, the binding energy of 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H is higher than that of 7.4VOx/Al2O3, suggesting that the interaction between the VOx species and alumina supports is stronger, which corresponds perfectly to the results of Raman spectroscopy. Consequently, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H-H2 contains a lower amount of surface V4+ and V3+ species when compared to 7.4VOx/Al2O3-H2 sample. This is due to the fact that stronger interaction between the VOx species and alumina support makes VOx species difficult to be reduced. According to the previous paper [9], both V4+ and V3+ are considered as active valence states for propane dehydrogenation, while V3+ is more active for propane dehydrogenation than other vanadium sites. Given this, the 7.4VOx/Al2O3-H2 catalyst containing a higher amount of V4+ and V3+ species can effectively improve the propane conversion and the stability of the catalyst. Furthermore, the amount of V3+ species for 7.4VOx/Al2O3-H2 catalyst decreases from 45.27 % to 23.33 % after the reaction, but that for 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H-H2 is reduced, from 38.23 % to 14.18 % after use, and 7.4VOx/Al2O3-H2 catalyst exhibits the lower declination of V3+ amount and higher ultimate V3+ content than 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H-H2, indicating that 7.4VOx/Al2O3 has a higher catalytic activity and stability. It is worth noting that the isolated species amount of 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 is similar to that of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 according to the results of Raman spectra and UV–vis DRS, while the former may have a higher amount of isolated species based on its lower surface V density and relatively stronger intensity of the Raman band at 1020 cm−1. However, the relatively strong interaction between VOx and the alumina support for 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 will influence the reducibility and surface acidity of catalysts. 3.3 Reducibility and surface acidity of samples In order to determine the reducibility of samples, all catalysts were tested by H2-TPR, and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. With the increase of vanadium amount in yVOx/Al2O3 samples, the reduction peak area in the range of 450–550°C grows obviously. For the catalysts with high vanadium amount at 9.2 wt% and 10.8 wt%, the reduction peak shifts to a higher temperature and a new reduction peak at 580°C appears. According to previous reports, the reduction peak at a range of 450–550 °C can be attributed to the reduction of isolated VOx species, and the reduction peak appearing at 580°C suggests the formation of less reducible highly polymerized VOx species [22]. The results above indicate that both isolated VOx and highly polymerized VOx species increase with the increase of vanadium amount from 2.5 wt% to 10.8 wt%. Compared to 7.4VOx/Al2O3, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H possesses the main reduction peak with higher temperature and a lower area due to the stronger interaction between VOx species and alumina support and lower amount of isolated VOx species. Although the amount of isolated species of 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 is higher than that of 7.4VOx/Al2O3, the stronger interaction between VOx species and alumina support leads to a relatively lower reducible VOx amount for 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600, which can worsen its catalytic activity. The results of peak fitting of NH3-TPD for all samples are shown in Fig. S6 and Table 3. The NH3 desorption peak temperature represents the acid intensity of the acidic sites on the catalyst surface, and its area can qualitatively indicate the number of acidic sites. Specifically, the peaks below 200 ◦C (peak I), in the range of 200–350 ◦C (peak II), and over 350 ◦C (peak III) belong to weak acid, medium strong acid and strong acid sites, respectively [28]. As shown in Table 3, with the increase of vanadium loading, the ratio of strong acid sites decreases, while the ratio of both medium strong acid sites and weak acid sites rises, suggesting that VOx species preferentially interact with the strong acidic sites in alumina [29]. It has been widely accepted that the weak acid sites are the active sites for PDH, but the side reactions including cracking, isomerization and polymerization, mainly occurs on strong acid sites, resulting in the carbon deposition and catalyst deactivation [30]. In addition, the total acid amount of yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts increases when the vanadium content increases from 2.5 % to 9.2 %, indicating more weak and medium strong acidic sites may be generated from the interaction between VOx and alumina support. Compared to the total acid amount of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, that of 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H and 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 are relatively higher. As vanadium content increases to 10.8 wt%, the total acid amount of the catalyst decreases, which may be attributed to the formation of amphoteric V2O5 crystals [22]. Apart from this, the increment of strong acidic sites of 10.8VOx/Al2O3 can be attributed to the re-exposure of strong acidic sites on the surface of alumina support due to the formation of multilayered V2O5 crystals. The amount increase in strong acid sites can be favorable for the adsorption of propane, but detrimental to the desorption of propylene at the same time, which enhances deeper side reactions and leading to a lower propylene selectivity and stability. 3.4 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of these catalysts was investigated by propane direct dehydrogenation reaction, and the reaction results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3. It can be seen clearly that the V loading and preparation method have significant influence on the propane conversion and propylene selectivity. With the increase of V loading, both propane conversion and propylene selectivity over VOx/Al2O3 catalyst increase firstly and then decrease, and 7.4VOx/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity. According to the results of Raman spectra, UV–vis DRS and H2-TPR, both isolated VOx and highly polymerized VOx species increase with the increase of vanadium amount from 2.5 wt% to 10.8 wt%, while V2O5-like species dominate for the catalysts with vanadium loading at 9.2 wt% and 10.8 wt%. Thus, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst possesses more isolated species and fewer V2O5-like species, which makes 7.4VOx/Al2O3 possess the highest catalytic activity. Furthermore, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 contains more V4+ than other yVOx/Al2O3 catalysts (XPS) and a moderate amount of total acid and strong acid sites (NH3-TPD), which are all beneficial for the enhancement of the catalyst activity and selectivity. Compared to 7.4VOx/Al2O3, 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H presents a lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity due to smaller amount of isolated VOx and larger aggregated VOx particles. The isolated species content in 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 is higher than that of 7.4VOx/Al2O3, but the amount of reducible isolated species is less than that of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 due to the stronger interaction between VOx species and the alumina support as revealed by the H2-TPR test. More importantly, this interaction can not only reduce the amount of reducible isolated species, but also enhance the amount of total acid and strong acid sites, which decreases the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. As reported previously, the higher the electron density is, the lower the binding energy is, and the weaker the interaction between vanadium and alumina support is [31,32]. Compared with 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 possesses a lower binding energy of VOx, weaker interaction between vanadium and alumina support, and higher electron density, which can promote the desorption of propylene product, thus improving the selectivity and stability of the catalyst. During the 5.25 h reaction period, the conversion of propane decreased by 1.2 %, 2.9 %, 2.6 %, 5.0 % and 6.1 % for 2.5VOx/Al2O3, 5.7VOx/Al2O3, 7.4VOx/Al2O3, 9.2VOx/Al2O3 and 10.8VOx/Al2O3, respectively, indicating that the catalyst stability decreases with the increase of vanadium content. This change trend is consistent with the TG test of spent catalysts in Fig. 3b, which shows that the weight loss of 2.5VOx/Al2O3-uesd, 5.7VOx/Al2O3-used, 7.4VOx/Al2O3-used, 9.2VOx/Al2O3-used and 10.8VOx/Al2O3-used is 3.23 %, 4.09 %, 4.73 %, 4.81 % and 5.37 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that the catalyst with a higher proportion of isolated species has good stability, which was consistent agreement with the research of Chen et al. [22]. Similarly, the catalyst stability of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 with more isolated species is higher than that of 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H with the declination of propane conversion of 10 % and a carbon deposition amount of 13.4 % within 5.25 h. Moreover, 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 also shows inferior catalytic stability, for which the conversion of propane decreases by 6.7 % and the carbon deposition amount is increased to 5.82 % within 5.25 h. Apart from the chemical state and dispersion of V, the unique pore structure of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 can contribute greatly to the improvement of catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. The hierarchical pore structures of VMOF derived VOx/Al2O3 catalysts have the distinguishing feature of micro-scale rod-like pores from MOF decomposition surrounded by nanoscale mesopore from alumina particle accumulation, and especially the active VOx species mainly distribute on the micro-scale pore walls. These can facilitate the accessibility of reactants to active sites, and the diffusion of products from catalyst pores, and improve the catalyst stability and the capacity of anti-carbon deposition. In our previous work, Pt-Sn-La/Al2O3 catalysts with large pore size exhibited much higher catalytic stability and lower coke deposition amount when compared to those with small pore size [15]. In addition, more strong acid sites for 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H and 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600 are another important factor for more carbon deposition and inferior catalyst stability. To determine the industrial value of VMOF derived catalysts, the long-term stability of 45.25 h over the 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst was tested, which is shown in Fig. 4d. Specifically, the conversion of propane only decreases by 12.5 % in 45.25 h (from 30.8 % to 18.3 %), while the selectivity of propylene keeps climbing up from 91.5 % to 95.5 % in the first 13.75 h, and then remains at 95.5 % for 31.5 h. In addition, consecutive propane dehydrogenation-oxidation carbon removal cycles over 7.4VOx/Al2O3 were carried out to further evaluate the stability and regeneration performance, and the variation of the activity and selectivity throughout the four cycles was presented in Fig. 4e. In order to obtain a better comparison of the performance in different cycles, the initial and final conversion, selectivity and yield for each cycle were calculated and shown in Table S3. It can be observed that the initial propane conversion decreases slightly from 30.8 % (first cycle) to 30.4 % (fourth cycle), final propane conversion after 6.25 h reaction decreases slowly from 28.0 % (first cycle) to 27.4 % (fourth cycle), and initial selectivity of propane increases from 91.6 % (first cycle) to 93.0 % (fourth cycle). These results demonstrate that the initial activity of catalyst can be completely recovered and remains robust, indicating superior cycle stability of the 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Compared with previous studies (Table S4), the VMOF derived VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in this work offer competitive advantages by high activity, selectivity and reaction-regeneration cycle stability. 4 Conclusion In this work, a series of spherical vanadium-based catalysts were synthesized using MIL-100(V) as the precursor by gum arabic-assisted sol-gel and N2-air dual calcination method. Specifically, VMOF derived catalysts preserved a certain amount of isolated VOx species even at a high vanadium loading content due to the separation of MOF organic ligands and the support of alumina. Furthermore, hierarchical porous VOx/Al2O3 catalyst was obtained. AlOOH was calcined at 600℃ to obtain mesoporous alumina. MIL-100(V) as “watermelon seeds” within VMOF/AlOOH was carbonized and removed by N2-air dual calcination, leaving micro-scale rod-like pores within VOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Moreover, compared to 7.2VOx/Al2O3-H and 7.4VOx/Al2O3-600, the interaction between VOx and alumina of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 was weak owing to the separation of MOF organic ligands and N2-air dual calcination, leading to the increase in the amount of V3+and reducible isolated species and the decrease in the amount of total acid and strong acid sites, which was beneficial for improving propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability of 7.4VOx/Al2O3. 7.4VOx/Al2O3 showed the highest catalyst activity with propane conversion of initial/ final 30.8 %/28.2 % and propylene selectivity of 91.6 %/94.7 % with a reaction time of 5.25 h. The high stability and excellent regeneration performance of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 have been demonstrated by the fact that the conversion of propane decreases from 30.8 % to 18.3 % in 45.25 h and four cycles of reaction. Compared with other reported catalysts, 7.4VOx/Al2O3 catalyst developed in this work has the potential for industrial application.

The as-prepared spherical catalyst exhibited a watermelon-seed-like structure with VMOF derived VOx as seeds, and isolated VOx species with good dispersion could be achieved even at a higher vanadium loading owing to the isolation effects of organic ligands of MOF and alumina support. The hierarchical porous structure with mesopores of alumina and micro-scale rod-like pores left by the decomposition of MIL-100(V) through N2-air dual calcination could be created. Besides, weaker interaction between VOx derived from MOF and alumina is beneficial for increasing the amount of reducible isolated species and decreasing strong acid site amount. 7.4VOx/Al2O3 presented the highest catalytic performance with propane conversion of 30.8 %/28.2 % (initial/final) and propylene selectivity of 91.6 %/94.7 % (initial/final) within 5.25 h reaction due to the good dispersion of VOx species, hierarchical porous structure and moderate amount of surface acid sites. The high stability and excellent reaction-regeneration cycle performance of 7.4VOx/Al2O3 offered a great potential for the industrial application of vanadium-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.",
