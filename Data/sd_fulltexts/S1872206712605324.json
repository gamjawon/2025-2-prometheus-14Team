Introduction Aryl nitriles are important building blocks of numerous pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, herbicides, natural products, and dyes [1,2]. They are also valuable intermediates in organic synthesis and can be easily transformed into a range of heteroâ€� cycles. In addition, nitriles are versatile intermediates in synâ€� thetic organic chemistry, since they can be easily converted into compounds with other functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amides, amines, and aldehydes [3]. NaCN and KCN are generally used as the cyanating agents for cyanation of alkyl halides [4]. However, the extremely poisonous nature of these cyanide salts seriously restricts their application from the enâ€� vironmental perspective. Recently, several methods for the cyanation of alkyl halides using trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) as the cyanating agent, which is less poisonous, have been developed [5â€“7]. Unfortunately, the use of Me3SiCN is inconvenient as it is expensive, sensitive to moisture, and easily liberates highly poisonous hydrogen cyanide. Recently, an atâ€� tractive improvement was made by Beller and coworkers [8,9]. Nontoxic, inexpensive, and easily handled K4[Fe(CN)6] was, for the first time, introduced as a cyanide source in cyanation reacâ€� tions [8â€“10]. Further modifications of the protocol were reâ€� ported for Pdâ€� and Cuâ€�catalyzed cyanation of aryl halides with K4[Fe(CN)6] [11â€“21]. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the preparation of heterogeneous Pd catalysts based on nanomeâ€� terâ€�scale Pd species [22,23]. Pd nanoparticles (PNPs) on a suitâ€� able support are recoverable, ligandâ€�free, green catalytic sysâ€� tems with improved catalytic properties [24â€“31]. In heterogeâ€� neous PNP systems, the catalytic properties are improved as a result of the high surfaceâ€�toâ€�volume ratio, and consequently the large fraction of metal atoms at the surface, and also by strong synergistic interactions between the PNPs and the support [22â€“31]. Usually, PNP catalysts are prepared from a Pd salt, on a substrate or stabilizer, in the presence of a reducing agent * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 Khodabakhsh NIKNAM et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 718â€“722 [32,33]. Steric, electrostatic, and electrosteric factors are reâ€� sponsible for stabilization of the PNPs during their synthesis. In this paper, we describe the preparation of immobilized PNPs on piperazineâ€�modified silica (PNPâ€�SBNPP) using a threeâ€�step process. First, activated silica was reacted with 3â€�chloropropyltrimethoxysilane in refluxing toluene to produce 3â€�chloropropylsilica (3â€�CPS) [34,35]. Second, 3â€�CPS was treated with piperazine to generate the corresponding substrate [35]. Finally, palladium acetate was reduced on the SBNPP substrate using absolute ethanol as the reducing agent (Scheme 1) [36,37]. The piperazines grafted on the silica surface can act as nitrogen ligands to stabilize PNPs, as previously reported for other nitrogen ligands [38â€“40]. 2. Experimental 2.1. General Chemicals were purchased from Fluka, Merck, and Aldrich Chemical companies. Infrared spectra were run on a Shimadzu IRâ€�435 spectrometer. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were run on Bruker Avance (500 MHz) and Bruker Ultrashield (400 MHz) spectrometers. Tetramethylsilane was used as the standard and chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm). Melting points were recorded on an SMP1 melting point appaâ€� ratus in open capillary tubes and are uncorrected. The reaction progress was followed by thinâ€�layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel SILG/UV 254 plates. 3â€�CPS was prepared using a previously reported procedure [34]. 2.2. Catalyst preparation 2.2.1. Preparation of SBNPP To a magnetically stirred mixture of 3â€�CPS (3 g) in toluene (110 ml), piperazine (1.3 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated at 60â€“70 Â°C in the presence of triethylamine as a proton abstractor, under continuous stirring in a dry nitrogen atmosphere for 48 h. The mixture was filtered and washed with dichloromethane (10 ml Ã— 3) and ethanol (10 ml Ã— 3). After drying in an oven at 80 Â°C, SBNPP was obtained as a white powder (3.4 g) [34,35]. 2.2.2. Preparation of PNPâ€�SBNPP To a mixture of SBNPP (1 g) in absolute ethanol (10 ml), palladium acetate (0.15 g, 0.67 mmol) was added, and the mixâ€� ture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol (10 ml Ã— 3). After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 Â°C, PNPâ€�SBNPP was obtained as a dark solid (1.1 g). 2.3. General procedure for cyanation reactions A mixture of K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.3 mmol), aryl halide (1 mmol), Na2CO3 (2.5 mmol), PNPâ€�SBNPP (0.05 g, 2.81 mol%), and diâ€� methylformamide (DMF; 2 ml) was stirred at 120 Â°C for the specified time. The reaction was followed using TLC. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the residue was washed with dichloromethane (10 ml Ã— 3) to separate the catalyst. Water (50 ml) was added to the organic phase and the dichloroâ€� methane was extracted from the water. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the organic solvent gave the products. For further purification, if needed, the products were passed through a short column of silica gel using nâ€�hexane as the eluent. All the products are known compounds and were compared with authentic samples. 3.

A histogram showing the size distribution of the PNPs on the SBNPP substrate is shown in Fig. 2, based on the data obtained from the TEM images. The average size of PNPs in the Pdâ€�SBNPP catalyst was 20 nm (Fig. 2). The microscopic features of the catalyst were observed usâ€� ing scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. 3). In this figure, we can see the morphology of the silica substrate. It can be seen that PNPs with a near spherical morphology are well immobiâ€� lized on the SBNPP substrate. The Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. 4 shows the crystalline structure of the PNPâ€�SBNPP catalyst. The XRD patâ€� tern of the PNPâ€�SBNPP catalyst also shows PNPs on the silica surface. The strongest peaks of the XRD pattern correspond to SiO2, and the other peaks are indexed as the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the PNPs [28,30]. Figure 5 shows the Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of the Pd(3d) envelope, confirming the presence of metallic Pd particles. XPS Pd(3d5/2) and Pd(3d3/2) peaks were observed at binding energies of 335 and 340.1 eV, respectively. These binding energies are similar to those reported in the literature for Pd metal [30,41]. To confirm the Pd content, the supported catalyst was treated with concentrated HCl and HNO3 to digest the Pd speâ€� cies and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomâ€� ic emission spectroscopy. The Pd content of PNPâ€�SBNPP was determined to be Î´ = 60.0 (60.0 mg/L = 6.0%, w/w). The reaction of iodobenzene with K4[Fe(CN)6] was studied as a model reaction and the catalytic loading of PNPâ€�SBNPP and the reaction conditions were screened. The optimized condiâ€� tions were aryl halide (1 mmol), K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.3 mmol), Na2CO3 (2.5 mmol), and PNPâ€�SBNPP (0.05 g, 2.81 mol%) in 2 ml of DMF solvent at 120 Â°C (Scheme 2). The system was extended to the reaction of K4[Fe(CN)6] with other aryl halides (Table 1). The cyanation of iodobenzene with K4[Fe(CN)6] provided the nitrile in 85% yield (Table 1, entry 2). Bromoâ€� and chloroâ€�benzene treated with K4[Fe(CN)6] respectively provided benzonitrile in 70% and 51% yields (Taâ€� ble 1, entries 4 and 5). 3â€�Bromopyridine and 3â€�chloropyridine were also successfully cyanated, providing a useful way of inâ€� troducing a cyanide group on a pyridine ring (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Cyanation of aryl halides in the presence of different functionalities such as hydroxyl, amine, and carbonyl was also achieved using the present catalytic system (Table 1, entries 6, 10â€“12). The possibility of recycling the catalyst was examined using the reaction of iodobenzene with K4[Fe(CN)6] under the optiâ€� 5 10152025303540 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 F r e q u e n c y ( % ) Particle size (nm) Â Fig. 2.

The recycled catalyst could be reused four times without any treatment (Fig. 6). 4. Conclusions In conclusion, this work shows that PNPs can be stabilized efficiently by a SBNPP substrate. These materials can be preâ€� pared, using a simple procedure, from commercially available and relatively cheap starting materials. The PNPâ€�SBNPP cataâ€� lyst efficiently catalyzed the cyanation reactions of aryl halides, with good to high yields. This catalyst could also be recovered and reused several times without noticeable loss of activity.

Article Silica-functionalized N-propylpiperazine for immobilization of palladium nanoparticles as efficient heterogeneous catalyst for cyanation reactions Khodabakhsh NIKNAM * Abdollah DERIS Farhad PANAHI Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Persian Gulf University, Bushehr 75169, Iran Department of Chemistry Faculty of Sciences Persian Gulf University Bushehr 75169 Iran * Corresponding author. Tel: +98-771-4541494; Fax: +98-771-4545188 An efficient heterogeneous Pd catalytic system has been developed, based on immobilization of Pd nanoparticles (PNPs) on a silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine (SBNPP) substrate. The SBNPP substrate effectively stabilizes the PNPs and improves their stability against aggregation. The catalytic activity of this catalyst was investigated in the cyanation of aryl halides with K4[Fe(CN)6] as the cyanide source. The catalyst could be recycled several times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. Graphical abstract A simple and efficient procedure for the cyanation of aryl halides with K4[Fe(CN)6] in the presence of Pd nanoparticles on silica-bonded N-propylpiperazine (PNP-SBNPP) is described. This heterogeneous catalyst could be recycled several times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity.
