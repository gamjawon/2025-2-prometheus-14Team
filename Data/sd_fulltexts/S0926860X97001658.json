Keywords: Methane combustion; Palladium/alumina; Hot isostatic pressing 1. Introduction Catalytic combustion is a useful method to suppress NOx emission [1-3]. Supported palladium catalysts are widely known to be active for methane combus- tion. However, one of the major problems of this catalyst system is the decrease of the catalytic activity caused by the decomposition of the active component PdO into Pd metal at the high combustion temperature [4-7]. The stabilities of supported PdO against reduc- tion depend on its states on the catalyst supports [4,8- 10]. Therefore, it is important to obtain stabilized PdO species which does not decompose even at the high *Corresponding author.

[5] have reported that a drop in catalytic activity at the high temperature range could be avoided by use of Mn-substituted hexaaluminate as a catalyst support. Stabilization of PdO by addition of rare earth elements has been also reported [11]. We have tried to apply HIP technique to the catalyst preparation in order to get stable palladium oxide species. Hot isostatic pressing is a method by which a workpiece is processed under the simultaneous application of high pressure and high temperature using gas as the pressure medium. This work presents the effect of HIP treatment on the catalytic activity for methane combustion in relation with some physical characteristics of catalysts. 150 K. Furuta et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 149-157 2. Experimental Supported catalysts were prepared by impregnating 6-A1203 (Showa Alminum) with an ethanol solution of Pd(CsH702)2 (Mitsuwa Chemicals). After drying, the catalyst precursors were precalcined in air at 773 K for 4 h. With the HIPed catalysts, the precalcined cata- lysts were hot isostatically pressed at 1373 K at the pressure region of 1.0-98.1 MPa (5% 02+95% Ar) using a Ultra-High Pressure HIP Equipment of Kobelco. The schematic view of the HIP equipment was shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, with non- HIPed catalyst, the precalcined catalysts were cal- cined in air at 1373 K for 4 h. The Pd loading was 0.5 wt%. The CH4 combustion reaction was carried out with a flow type fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pres- sure. A mixed gas consisting of 0.5% CH4 in air was fed to catalyst bed at SV=50000 h-1. The reaction effluent was analyzed with a gas chromatograph after the reaction for 14 min at the prescribed tem- perature. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out in air by heating the samples at a rate of 20rain- 1 in order to evaluate the stability of palladium oxide species on supports. The X-ray diffraction spectra were obtained on a Mac Science diffractmeter using CuKa radiation to analyze the crystalline phases of palladium oxide species. The dispersion of Pd was measured by means of CO adsorption in which, prior to CO adsorption measurement, samples were reduced in a hydrogen stream at 393 K for 15 rain. The X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded at room temperature on a V.G. Scientific ESCALAB 200-X spectrometer. The bind- ing energy of C ls=284.6 eV was taken as reference. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of oxy- gen was measured in a flow system (Altamira Instru- ments, AMI-1). Prior to the measurement, the sample was treated in an oxygen stream (30 ml/min) at 1073 K for 30 min.

Desorbed gas was analyzed with a quadrupole mass spectrometer MMC-200 of Ulvac Japan. 1243 K. On the other hand, the non-HIPed catalyst decomposed at a lower temperature of 1083-1123 K. From these results, it was clarified that HIP treatment for PdOhS-A1203 catalyst stabilized PdO and sup- pressed the decomposition of palladium oxide. 3. Results 3.3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis 3.1. Catalytic activity for CH4 combustion The catalytic activity for CH4 combustion over HIPed 0.5 wt% PdO/tS-Al203 catalysts were measured as a function of temperature. The influence of HIP pressure on the catalytic activity is shown in Fig. 2. In cases of raising the reaction temperature, every cata- lyst showed more than 90% methane conversion at the high temperature range (973-1173 K). However, in the cases of cooling down, the catalytic activity depended on HIP pressure. The catalyst calcined at atmospheric pressure, in other words, the non-HIPed catalyst, showed a remarkable drop in catalytic activ- ity at 1023 K. The catalytic activity at 1023 K increased with increasing HIP pressure. A catalyst treated at high pressure, such as 98.1 MPa, showed no drop in catalytic activity at the temperature of 1023 K. 3.2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA ) In order to examine the thermal stabilities of sup- ported PdO, thermogravimetric analyses were carried out. With the HIPed catalyst, the weight loss due to PdO decomposition started at 1113 K and continued to The influence of HIP pressure on the crystal struc- ture of palladium oxides was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the full width at half maximum of PdO(1 0 1) and PdO(002) dif- fraction peak of 0.5 wt% PdO/g-A1203 catalysts decreased with increasing HIP pressure. However, the intensity of PdO(1 0 1) and PdO(0 0 2) diffraction peak was weak and the diffraction peaks overlapped. Then, to clarify this phenomenon, the X-ray diffrac- tion patterns of the high loading specimen (2 wt% PdO/tS-A1203) was measured. The X-ray diffraction peak due to PdO, split into two peaks, was observed for the HIPed specimen (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the PdO peaks of the non-HIPed specimen (Fig. 4b) are broader than that of the HIPed one. The reasons why the width of an X-ray diffraction peak are broad are thought to include the facts that the crystallinity of PdO is low and/or that the crystallite size is small in the non-HIPed catalyst. In the non-HIPed specimen, a shoulder peak appeared at around 40which can be assigned to Pd metal. This result shows that the palladium oxide species on the non-HIPed specimen were partly reduced. 100 80\" Z g 60- '~_ c 40\" o L.)

Particle size of PdO The average particle size of PdO estimated by the amount of chemisorbed CO on the reduced catalyst is shown in Table 1. The average Pd particle size of the HIPed catalyst was smaller than that of the non-HIPed catalyst, though its surface area was smaller than that of the non-HIPed catalyst. This result suggests that the PdO X-ray diffraction peak of HIPed catalyst being narrower than the non-HIPed one was not due to the particle growth, but the higher crystallinity. In other words, PdO particles in the non-HIPed catalyst are presumed to involve a large number of lattice defects. 3.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis Binding energies of Pd 3d5/2 are shown in Table 2. The Pd 3d5/2 binding energy of HIPed catalyst was higher than that of bulk PdO (337.1 eV). It is thought that this shift of binding energy was caused by the formation of fine PdO particles [12]. On the other hand, the Pd 3d5/2 binding energy of non-HIPed catalyst was lower than that of bulk PdO. This shift of the binding energy suggests that the palladium oxide on non-HIPed catalyst was partly reduced. 3.6. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of oxygen The TPD profiles of alumina-supported palladium oxide catalysts, PdO powder and alumina supports are shown in Fig. 5. Several peaks due to decomposition of palladium oxide species were observed with the supported catalysts, on comparing with the profile of alumina supports. On HIPed alumina support, oxygen desorption occurred above 1073 K. On the other hand, there K.

When the alumina support was calcined at 773 K, oxygen des- orption was observed. Therefore, the peak appeared above 1073 K is not peculiar to a HIPed specimen. It is thought that this peak is due to a desorption of surface hydroxyl groups. For the HIPed samples, even if hydroxyl groups desorb from the surface of the cata- lyst, they adsorb again during cooling down, because the chamber of HIP equipment is closed up during HIP treatment. For the non-HIPed specimen, when the calcination temperature is low, the hydroxyl groups do not desorb completely. The peak at highest temperature region for HIPed PdO//%A1203 is broader than that of HIPed A1203. 154 K.

On the other hand, in the case of inert gas, the speci- men HIPed at 98.1 MPa showed almost the same catalytic activity as the non-HIPed catalyst. This result indicates that oxygen pressure during calcination is of critical importance for stability of PdO. 4. Discussion Comparing these two TPD profiles, we can clarify that decomposition of palladium oxide species also occurred above 1073 K on HIPed PdO/6-A1203. Therefore, it is assumed that in HIPed catalyst two types of stable palladium oxide species (peak A and B in Fig. 5) are formed. On the other hand, palladium oxide species in non-HIPed catalyst decomposed by 1023 K. Furthermore a shoulder peak was observed at lower temperature (peak C in Fig. 5). 3. 7. Effect of oxygen pressure of HIP treatment on the catalytic activity The effect of oxygen pressure and inert gas in HIP treatment was examined. As shown in Fig. 6, the The model of palladium oxide species shown in Fig. 7 is proposed to explain the effect of HIP treat- ment on the catalytic activity. From the equation of formation energy of PdO [13], it is estimated that under the HIP condition, 5% 02, 98 MPa, namely, 4.9 MPa of the oxygen pressure, the decomposition of PdO does not occur at a temperature about 1373 K. The crystallinity of stabilized PdO is maintained through cooling down to room temperature. Further- more, Pdn+ species at unoccupied (by A13+) sites on A1203 surface [14] may be formed to affect the stability of palladium oxide species. On the other hand, in the case of catalyst treated at 1373 K under the lower pressure (<49 MPa), PdO decomposes to Pd metal, and then Pd particles aggregate into large particles. In this case, it is thought that Pdn+ species \"-2. e- HIPed non-HIPed catalyst PdO powder i i i I - i , , , i , , , i , , , i , 273 (b) HIPed AI203 nm non-HIPed AIz03 _l A | i i I i i | I i , , . i . . , i . 473 673 873 1073 1273 273 473 673 873 1073 1273 Temperature [K] Temperature [K] Fig. 5.

The Pd particles are reoxidized to PdO during cooling down. The crystallinity of reoxidized PdO is low, because the oxidation bring Pd particles into smaller pieces [4] and/or the oxidation of Pd does not proceed to the inner part of the particles. At the reaction temperature of 1173 K, PdO in non- HIPed catalyst decomposes to Pd. Palladium oxide species in HIPed catalyst, by contrast, is hard to decompose (corresponding to peak A and B in Fig. 5). It is thought that this difference in PdO stability is due to the crystallinity of PdO and Pdn+ species stabilized at unoccupied (by A13-) site on A1203 surface. It can be expected that the PdO par- ticles with many lattice defects decompose easily (peak C in Fig. 5). On the other hand, Pd\"+ species at unoccupied (by AI3+) sites on A1203 surface may affect the stability of palladium oxide. Despite the differences in PdO state, CH4 conversion reached 100% at 1173 K in all catalysts, because in this temperature region the thermal reaction is more domi- nant than the catalytic one. Each catalyst, except the catalyst HIP treated with high pressure gas of oxygen, shows decrease in CH4 conversion with lowering in reaction temperature and shows a minimum conversion at 1023 K in the case of cooling down the reaction temperature. The weight of the thermal reaction decreases with decreasing in temperature and the catalytic reaction gradually becomes dominant, so the CH4 conversion depends on the catalytic activity, namely the amounts of active palladium oxide species in the catalysts.

Fig. 5(b), the HIPed sample had surface hydroxyl groups. Then, surface hydroxyl groups in the HIPed catalyst may also affect the catalytic activity at the temperature region of 973 and 1173 K. However, the catalyst HIPed in argon atmosphere, which had many surface hydroxyl groups in the same manner as the catalyst HIPed in oxygen atmosphere, showed a drop in catalytic activity at the reaction temperature region of 973 and 1173 K. Therefore, it is concluded that the surface hydroxyl group does not have much effect on catalytic activity. Non-HIPed catalysts have little amount of active palladium oxide species above 978 K. Then, these catalysts show very low activity for the CH4 combus- tion reaction. On the other hand, HIPed catalysts have high catalytic activity because of the presence of stabilized and active palladium oxide species on the catalyst support. As metallic Pd is reoxidized into the active palla- dium oxide species at temperature below 1023 K, so the catalytic activity increases with decreasing tem- perature down to 973 K. K. Furuta et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 149-157 157 5. Conclusions It was found that HIP treatment of PdO/g-A1203 is quite effective to suppress the drop in catalytic activity at the reaction temperature region of 973 and 1173 K. This effect can be explained by the formation of stabilized palladium oxide species by the HIP treat- ment using oxygen. The stability of palladium oxide species in HIPed catalyst seems to be attributed to crystallinity and high dispersion.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic properties of PdO/δ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) have been investigated. The HIP treated catalysts (HIPed catalysts) showed higher catalytic activity for the oxidation of methane in the temperature range 973-1173 K than the catalysts calcined in atmosphere (non-HIPed catalysts). These catalysts were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, CO adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen. It was found that the palladium oxide stable against reduction was formed by the HIP treatment, and that oxygen in the HIP atmosphere played an important role for the formation of the stabilized palladium oxide species. The temperature dependence of catalytic activity was explained in connection with the palladium oxide species on the support.",
