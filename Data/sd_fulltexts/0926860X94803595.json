Zdrazil* Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Rozvojova 135, 165 02 Prague 6 Suchdol, Czech Republic Received 27 January 1994, revised 10 May 1994, accepted 12 May 1994 Abstract Active carbon supported molybdena catalysts (15% M003) were prepared by new slurry impregnation method (SIM) using carbon of various origin and particle size. The support was refluxed with the slurry of powdered M003 in water. A low solubility of M003 was sufficient for transport of M003 from the powder via the solution to the surface of the support. Calcination was left out because no other chemicals beside M003 and water were used in the impregnation. The catalysts were presulfided and tested in hydrodesulfurization of thiophene at 1.6 MPa and 300-400. Their activity was four times higher than that of a commercial molybdena on alumina catalyst and about the same as the activity of a carbon supported catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method (CIM) using ammonium heptamolybdate. The advantage of the new SIM over CIM method is: (i) all molybdena species are deposited by adsorption; precipitation during drying is negligible, (ii) oxidative degradation of the carbon support cannot occur during preparation because calcination is left out; ammonium sulfide is not formed during presulfidation of the uncalcined catalysts.

Zdrazil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [ 4-8 ] and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [ 9-12 ] , more resistant to coking [ 1,6,9] and their HDS activity is less inhibited by parallel HDN [ 11,13]. Separation of metals from spent catalysts can easily be achieved by incineration of the carbon support. However, some other properties of carbon supported catalysts are unconvenient for industrial application: microporosity, poor mechanical properties and low packing density [2,3,9], strong adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [ 14] and possible long-term instability under severe hydrotreating conditions. Another disadvantage is susceptibility of carbon supports to oxidation. In the usual preparation of alumina supported catalysts, molybdenum is introduced by impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate which is decomposed to supported molybdenum(VI) oxide by calcination in air at about 300-500. The obtained oxidic precursor is then sulfided. Carbon supported catalysts cannot be calcined in such a way because transition metal ions catalyze oxidation of carbon supports in the range of temperatures 300-500. For this reason, carbon supported catalysts were treated in one of the following ways in the literature. (i) The catalyst was calcined in air at a low temperature of about 250. This was applied to graphitized carriers [ 15,16 ] which are more resistant to oxidation than active carbons. (ii) Catalyst was calcined in inert gas at temperature of about 400-600 [ 16,17 ] . The disadvantage is that molybdenum(VI) might partially be reduced by ammonia in the absence of oxygen; reduction before sulfidation is harmful for activity of the catalyst [18]. (iii) The calcination step was left out and the deposited ammonium heptamolybdate was decomposed during in-situ sulfidation in catalytic reactor. This is the most frequently used procedure, see e.g. refs. [ 6,9,11,18-21 ] . The disadvantage is that ammonium sulfide is released which can cause plugging problems in downstream part of the apparatus. We have recently reported that molybdena can be supported on alumina by refluxing the carrier with aqueous slurry of M003 in water [ 22 ] . The low solubility of M003 (0.1 and 2.19 of M003 per 100 ml of water at 18 and 70, respectively [ 23 ] ) is sufficient for a gradual transport of molybdenum species from solid M003 via the solution to the adsorbed phase on the alumina surface. The calcination step is left out because no other chemicals beside M003 and water are used in the impregnation. This method can be called slurry impregnation method (SIM). The purpose of the present work is to show that the SIM method can also be used to support M003 on active carbon. Leaving the calcination step out is especially advantageneous for carbon supports because oxidative degradation of them would occur during calcination in air. The activity of Mo/C catalysts prepared by the SIM method was tested in HDS of thiophene and was compared with the activity of samples prepared by conventional impregnation with a solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and also with the activity of a commercial Mo/alumina catalyst. M. Zdraiil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 287 2. Experimental 2.1. Supports The active carbon Norit RX3 Extra (Norit N.V., Netherlands) is named here C(N); the BET surface area, pore volume and volume of micOpores were 1280 m2 g-', 1.04 cml g-', and 0.48 cm3 g-', respectively. The active carbon GA-1 (Slovenske Wobne zavody, l-Inu9fa, Slovakia) is named here C(G); the texture properties were 1100 m2 g-', 0.75 cm3 g-', and 0.49 cm3 g-', respectively. It was refluxed several times with water (total volume 501 per 100 g of the support) to remove alkali, and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator (90-100, 4-6 kPa). 2.2. Catalysts The acronyms SIM and CIM designate the slurry impregnation method using a slurry of Mo03 in water and the classical impregnation method using a solution of ammonium heptamolybdate, respectively. The catalysts were named according to the following example: SIM- ISMo03/C(N) is the catalyst with a nominal content of 15% of Mo03 and 85% of the active carbon Norit, and prepared by the slurry impregnation method. The catalysts prepared and tested are summarized in Table 1. The commercial catalyst was included as the reference point of activity. In the SIM preparation, the slurry of carrier and M003 (p.a., Fluka) in water was refluxed. The boiling intensity was kept minimal in order to avoid attrition of support particles. After disappearance of the white powder of M003, the impregnated particles were separated from the slightly turbid liquid. The liquid was dried and the obtained powder was weighed. The purpose was to check that the amount of unadsorbed molybdenum species was negligible. This powder was not analyzed but it was assumed that it was formed mostly by fine particles of the support mixed with a smaller amount of M003. The catalysts prepared by the SIM method were not calcined.

Zdraiil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 Catalyst SIM-15Mo03/C(N) The support (3.4 g) was refluxed with water (150 ml) for 0.5 h to remove dust particles. The turbid liquid was decanted and the M003 slurry (0.62 g, as obtained) in water (25 ml) was added to the wet support. It was refluxed for 5 days, with standing at room temperature overnight, until all M003 had disappeared (the greater part disappeared in three days). The extrudates were separated by pincette and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator (90-100, 4-6 kPa) for 0.5 h. The turbid liquid remaining after separation of the extrudates was dried and 0.01 g of black powder was obtained. Catalyst SIM-15Mo03/C(G) The support (1 g) was mixed with M003 (0.18 g, ground in agate mortar) and water (20 ml). The mixture was heated for 1 h at 90, left standing for 3 h and again heated for 1 h at 90. Almost all the white powder of M003 disappeared. The mixture was left standing at room temperature with occasional shaking for two weeks in order to allow an adsorption equilibrium to establish inside the pore texture of the support. All the white powder of M003 disappeared. The slightly turbid liquid was poured off and dried, and 0.01 g of dark grey powder was obtained. The catalyst was dried in a rotary evaporator (0.5 h, 90-100, 4-6 kPa). Catalyst CIM-13Mo03/C(G) The support (20 g) was mixed with a solution of (NH4) oM07024 . 4H20 (3.35 g) in water (50 ml). The water was removed in rotary evaporator until the solid was just wet. It was heated in this wet form for 1 h at 80 and then dried. The catalyst was calcined in a stream of nitrogen; the temperature was increased linearly for 1 h to 400 and kept at this value for another 1 h. 2.3. Catalytic activity The model reaction was the HDS of thiophene. The integral conversion data were obtained in a fixed bed flow reactor with I.D. 2 mm. The catalysts were tested as 0.16-0.32 mm particles. The total pressure was 1.6 MPa, the initial pressure of thiophene (TH) was 40 kPa, the feed rate F(TH) was 0.6 mmol h-', and the hydrogen flow was 1.5 mol h-'. The catalyst charge was always 0.01 g and it was diluted in ratio 1:3 with corundum (low surface a-alumina) of the same particle size. The catalyst was in-situ presulfided with a H2S/H2 mixture (1:10) at atmospheric pressure and 400 for 2 h. The conversion of TH, x(TH), was sequentially determined at several temperatures from 400 to 300. The conversion was defined as x(TH) = (nTH) -n(TH)) /nTH), where nand n are the initial and final number of moles, respectively. The test lasted about 9 h, and no deactivation of the catalyst was observed. M. Zdrajil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 289 2.4. Surface area BET surface area and pore size distribution were measured by adsorption of nitrogen at -78 using a Digisorb 2600 V4.02 (Micromeritics) instrument. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Surface area The effect of SIM impregnation on surface area of the carbon carrier was measured for the catalyst SIM-15Mo03/C(N) and the results are presented in Table 2. The data for the conventional catalyst ClM-13Mo03/C(G) and literature data on Co-Mo and Ni-Mo catalysts are also included for comparison (literature data on Mo/C catalyst are not available). The deposition of Mo and Co(Ni) salts by conventional impregnation resulted in a strong decrease of surface area when comparing dried catalysts with the corresponding supports. This can be explained by filling and plugging of the micropores by the supported salts.

A high surface area was achieved in the SIM impregnation without calcination of catalysts. The decrease of surface area for the dried SIM sample as compared with the support alone was small, only about 20%, which is comparable to the decrease observed for calcined CIM sample. The small effect of SIM impregnation on surface area of active carbon can be taken as an indirect evidence that M003 deposited by the SIM method is predominantly adsorbed as a monolayer on the walls of the pores and that microcrystals which might plug the micropores are practically absent. This conclusion is further supported by the observed very small difference between pore size distribution of the active carbon carrier and the corresponding SIM catalyst. 3.2. Catalytic activity The conversion data are presented in Fig. 1. The relative activities of the catalysts were evaluated by the procedure used in our previous papers dealing with other catalysts [4,11,22]. It was checked previously that under the limiting conditions of our test at fixed pressure of hydrogen and fixed initial concentration of TH, the dependence x(TH) -f(W/F(TH)) follows in the range of x(TH) from 0.01 to 0.90 the pseudo-first order rate equation with the apparent rate constant k. All catalysts were tested at the same fixed space time W/F(TH) and at several temperatures. Eq. (1) can be written for each temperature: M. Zdrazil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 291 ln(1-x(TH,j))= k(~ ln(1-x(TH,r)), (1) where j and r denote the j-th and the reference catalyst, respectively. The commercial M003/alumina catalyst BASF M-8-30 was chosen as the reference catalyst in the present work. Straight lines were obtained by plotting the conversions x(TH) at various temperatures according to Eq. (1) . It means that the apparent activation energies of the samples tested were the same. The ratios k(j) l k(r) were obtained from the straight lines according to Eq. (1) . These parameters are independent of temperature and characterize the relative activity of the catalysts over the whole range of temperatures measured, 300-400. The values are shown in Table 1. It is seen in Table 1 that the carbon supported catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation using ammonium heptamolybdate was about four times more active than the conventional alumina supported catalyst. Such a strong positive effect of the active carbon support on activity of sulfide catalysts as compared with alumina support is well known in the literature [ 4-8 ] . The activity of the Mo/C catalysts prepared by the new slurry impregnation method was about the same as the activity of the Mo/C sample prepared by the conventional impregnation. In terms of activity, the SIM method does not seem to be especially advantageneous over the CIM method. However, the important advantage of the SIM method is that the calcination step is left out and ammonium sulfide is not formed during presulfidation. No other chemicals beside M003 and water are introduced into the carrier in the slung impregnation method. In this respect, thermal spreading of M003 [ 24-27 ] and vapour-phase deposition of Mo02 (OH) 2 [ 28 ] used previously by other authors for alumina-supported catalysts are similar methods. However, both these methods are not applicable to active carbon catalysts because they use severe conditions, i.e. high temperatures of 45000 in wet air. Oxidative degradation of active carbon would occur under such a treatment. The SIM method represents a new interesting alternative to prepare the catalyst using only M003 and water under mild conditions which are not harmful to the active carbon carrier. In conventional impregnation with well soluble compounds, one part of the deposited species is adsorbed and the other part is precipitated during drying. The ratio of them depends on the impregnation technique used (incipient wetness, equilibrium adsorption, etc.). Adsorption is usually performed at room temperature and the redistribution of deposited species occurs at the higher temperature of drying, e.g. [ 29 ] . The adsorbed species are commonly considered to be more desirable than the precipitated phase because it is assumed that adsorbed species are transformed to a highly dispersed active phase in the finished catalyst. All molybdenum species deposited by the new SIM method are adsorbed species. The molybdenum content of the liquid in the pores during drying is very small and it can be assumed that the precipitation during drying is negligible. It can also be 292 M. Zdrazil /Applied Catalysis A: General 115 (1994) 285-293 expected that redistribution during drying is minimal because the temperature of drying is the same as that of adsorption. The mechanism of adsorption of molybdenum species on alumina was interpreted as the reaction of molybdate anions with surface hydroxyls (e.g. [25,30,31] ) and adsorption on unsaturated A13 + sites [ 31 ] . The mechanism of adsorption on carbon carriers is much less understood, as it is connected with the complex surface chemistry of carbons (surface properties of carbon [ 32 ] , adsorption of molybdate species on carbon [33,34] ). Some of the surface functional groups involved in adsorption decompose at calcination temperature (e.g. carbonyls) and this might cause sintering of the active phase [ 34] . Calcination is left out in the SIM preparation and the chance to preserve a high dispersion of the active phase in the finished catalyst is higher. The general theoretical background of the SIM method is discussed in more detail in the previous paper on alumina supported catalysts [22] . The most important conclusion is that chemical potential and not concentration of the molybdenum species in the impregnation solution determines the amount adsorbed in equilibrium. The high loading achievable with the SIM method indicates that the chemical potential of M003 dissolved in pure water (without addition of ammonia or any other chemicals) is high even when the concentration of the solution is very low. The SO impregnation is relatively slow and this might be disadvantageneous for impregnation of larger support particles. However, the experiment with the sample SO-15Mo03/C(N) showed that extrudates of a diameter of about 3 mm can be impregnated in such a way. The high activity observed with the crushed catalyst seems to indicate that impregnation was not limited to surface layers of extrudates but that molybdenum species penetrated into the interior mass. It is concluded that the slurry impregnation method is a simple, clean and effective method to deposit molybdena on active carbon: no other chemicals beside M003 and water are used, the temperature is much lower than in thermal spreading of M003 or in vapour deposition of Mo02(OH)2, high loadings are achievable, all deposited species are adsorbed, calcination is left out and ammonium sulfide is not produced during activation, and the activity of the catalysts is at least comparable to catalysts prepared by conventional impregnation using ammonium heptamolybdate.

Active carbon supported molybdena catalysts (15% MoO3) were prepared by new slurry impregnation method ( SIM ) using carbon of various origin and particle size. The support was refluxed with the slurry of powdered MoO3 in water. A low solubility of MoO3 was sufficient for transport of MoO3 from the powder via the solution to the surface of the support. Calcination was left out because no other chemicals beside MoO3 and water were used in the impregnation. The catalysts were presulfided and tested in hydrodesulfurization of thiophene at 1.6 MPa and 300–400°C. Their activity was four times higher than that of a commercial molybdena on alumina catalyst and about the same as the activity of a carbon supported catalyst prepared by the conventional impregnation method (CIM) using ammonium heptamolybdate. The advantage of the new SIM over CIM method is: (i) all molybdena species are deposited by adsorption; precipitation during drying is negligible, (ii) oxidative degradation of the carbon support cannot occur during preparation because calcination is left out; ammonium sulfide is not formed during presulfidation of the uncalcined catalysts.
