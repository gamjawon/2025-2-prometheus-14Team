Under identical operating conditions, the Co/SiO2 catalyst is considerably more active for ethanol conversion than the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, in spite of the lower measured metal surface area. The higher activity of the Co/SiO2 catalyst combined with its higher selectivity towards the industrially desired lower amines (MEA and DEA) make the metal a promising catalyst. Selectivity to individual ethylamine products (i.e. mono-, di- and triethylamine) is kinetically controlled and a function of the operating parameters as well as of the metal catalyst employed. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and hydrogen chemisorption have been used to characterize the physico-chemical differences between the catalysts used in this study. Keywords: Cobalt: Ethanol amination; Nickel 1. Introduction Ethylamines find considerable industrial application, especially as reactants in the synthesis of industrial chemical intermediates and end products. Monoethylam- ine is used in the synthesis of herbicides, corrosion inhibitors and wash and wear agents for fabrics, diethylamine is used in the synthesis of rubber processing chem- icals, pharmaceuticals and epoxy curing agents and triethylamine is used in the production of textile treating chemicals, insecticides and antibiotics [1,2]. Mon- oethylamine is manufactured in the largest quantities by the organic synthesis industry. * Corresponding author. E-mail gs@chemeng.uct.ac.za, tel.

Sewell et al. / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 125 (1995) 99- l 12 Among several methods which have been proposed for the synthesis of ethyla- mines [2], the reductive amination of ethanol has gained considerable importance [3]. Although a number of supported metals have been applied for the reductive amination of alcohols [2], nickel and cobalt appear to be the preferred catalysts for industrial application [ 1,4-7 ]. The reductive amination of ethanol using cobalt has been studied using supports such as alumina [ 1,4], kieselguhr [ 1 ], silica and zeolite Y [6] whilst the performance of nickel has been investigated using supports such as silica [4], alumina and kieselguhr [ 1 ]. A silica supported nickel-rhenium catalysts has also been shown to be an efficient catalyst for the amination of ethanol using ammonia [7]. The product from this commercial process typically comprises an equilibrium controlled distribution of ethylamines, the ratios of which can be altered by adjust- ing the feed ratio or the reaction temperature [8]. No study, however, has yet been presented which compares the performance of cobalt and nickel catalysts over a range of operating conditions. This paper presents the results of a study comparing the performance of silica- supported cobalt (Co/SiO2) and nickel (Ni/SiO2) catalysts for the amination of ethanol. In particular, the effect of varying space velocity, hydrogen pressure, ammonia pressure and reaction temperature are reported. Physico-chemical char- acterization of the catalysts was used as a basis for comparison of the observed differences in catalytic performance. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts used in this study were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of silica gel (May and Baker) using an aqueous solution of the corresponding metal nitrate. The concentrations of the impregnating solutions were adjusted so as to give metal loadings of 10 wt.-% after activation of the catalyst. The support employed was silica gel with a measured N2 BET surface area of 725 m2/g. The metal salts used, viz. Co(NO3)2 \"6H20 and Ni(NO3)2' 6H20, were analytical grade reagents (99% minimum purity) and were supplied by Merck. Following impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 100 for a period of 16 h before storage in a desiccator. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Reduction behaviours of the catalysts were obtained using a temperature pro- grammed reduction (TPR) apparatus constructed of stainless steel valves and fittings and containing a quartz microreactor. Prior to reduction, the catalyst ( ~ 0.15 g) was calcined in 60 ml(NTP)/min air at 500 for 3 h in order to decompose G. Sewell et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 99-112 101 the nitrate precursor. Reduction was performed in a 60 ml(NTP)/min 5% H2/N2 stream as the temperature was raised linearly from 100 to 1000 at 10/min. Before entry into the thermal conductivity detector (TCD), the reductant stream was fed through a 3A molecular sieve trap to remove water formed by metal oxide reduction. 60 ml (NTP)/min of nitrogen was used as a TCD reference stream and hydrogen consumptions were recorded as differences in thermal conductivity between the two streams. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) studies were performed in the same apparatus as used for temperature programmed reduction. The procedure involved calcination of the catalyst sample ( = 0.15 g) in 60 mI(NTP)/min air at 500 for 3 h followed by reduction in 60 ml(NTP)/min 5% Hz/N2 at 500 for 3 h (i.e. the procedure used to activate the catalysts used for reaction studies). After reduc- tion, the catalyst sample was cooled to 50. Temperature programmed oxidation of the reduced catalyst was performed in a 30 ml/min 2% O2/He stream as the temperature was raised linearly from 50 to 1000 at 10/rain. 30 mI(NTP)/min helium was used as the TCD reference stream and oxygen consumptions were recorded as differences in thermal conductivity between the two streams. Metal surface area determinations were performed in a conventional Pyrex glass volumetric adsorption apparatus using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 chemisorption apparatus. The procedure involved precalcination of the catalyst sample ( ~ 0.5 g) in 60 mI(NTP)/min air at 500 for 3 h followed by reduction in 60 ml(NTP)/ rain hydrogen at 500 for 3 h. The reduced catalyst was cooled to 400 and evacuated until the pressure was less than 1 10 3 torr. The reduced catalyst samples were then cooled under vacuum and the hydrogen adsorption isotherms were measured between 300 and 450 torr at 100 for the Co/SiO2 catalyst [9] and at 25 for the Ni/SiO2 catalyst [ 10]. 2.3. Ethanol amination The gas phase amination of ethanol was studied in an atmospheric, continuous flow reactor with on-line gas chromatographic detection of reaction products (Fig. 1 ). Sampling of reactant and product gases was performed using a six-way valve and the samples were analyzed using a Varian Model 3700 gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detector. The separation was achieved using a 4 m 3 mm ID glass column packed with 60/80 mesh Carbopack B/4% Carbowax 20M/0.8% KOH. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard allowing mass balances to be determined to within 5%. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst precursor (2.00 g) was calcined in 100 ml (NTP)/min air at 500 for 3 h and then cooled to 100 before reduction. The reduction was performed in 100 ml(NTP)/min of a 20% H2/N2 gas mixture at 500 for 3 h. After cooling in nitrogen to 100, the reactor was switched to bypass and the feed delivery system was stabilized. Once the feed delivery system had been stabilized, the feed stream was directed downwards through the catalyst 102 G. Sewell et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 125 ( / 995) 99 112 N~ / .

REACTOR ':TIC) (F,) bed and the temperature was increased at 10/min up to the required operating temperature. At this stage, the catalyst was stabilized for 24 h after which negligible change in activity was observed. The influence of space velocity on reductive amination was investigated at ethanol space velocities between 0.1 and 2 g/(goat h). The temperature was 180 and the EtOH:NH3:H2 molar ratio was 1:2:10. To investigate the influence of hydrogen partial pressure on the reaction, the hydrogen pressure was systematically reduced to zero at a temperature of 180, an ethanol weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.5 g/(gcat h) and an EtOH:NH3 molar ratio of 1:2. The ammonia and ethanol partial pressures were kept constant by adjusting the total flow rate to 300 ml/min using nitrogen diluent. The influence of the ammonia partial pressure on catalyst performance was investigated between NH3:EtOH molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 4:1. The temperature was 180, the ethanol WHSV was 0.25 g/(g~at h) and the EtOH:H2 molar ratio was 10. The total flow rate was adjusted to 300 mI(NTP)/min using nitrogen diluent in order to ensure constant ethanol and hydrogen partial pressures. The effect of temperature was studied in the range 140 to 200 at an ethanol WHSV of 0.25 g/(gc~, h) and an EtOH:NH3:H2 molar ratio of 1:2:10. The total flow rate was adjusted to 300 ml(NTP)/min using nitrogen. The conversion on a molar basis is defined as: Conversion (%) = (1 -nEtOHout/nEtoHin) X 100 Product selectivities have been calculated from the peak areas (Areai) corrected for different response factors (RFi) and normalized to moles of product using the molecular masses (Mi) of the different compounds.

Temperature programmed reduction Reduction behaviours of both the supported as well as the unsupported oxides of nickel and cobalt were investigated using temperature programmed reduction. Both supported catalysts exhibited large extents of metal support interaction which influenced metal reducibility. This factor is of considerable importance in this study since only metal reducible by 500 is available for reductive amination. A maxi- mum reduction temperature of 500 was chosen in order to minimize sintering whilst still obtaining a high extent of reduction. The TPR spectrum of the Co/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 2) showed both the low tem- perature reduction of Co304 at 350 as well as the reduction of various cobalt- silicate species [ 11-13] at higher temperatures. Measurement of the hydrogen consumption during temperature programmed reduction of the Co/SiO2 catalyst to 1000 showed that 1.14 mmol of hydrogen was required to reduce 1 mmol of cobalt (assuming complete reduction up to 1000). It thus appears that the cobalt is present as a mixture of divalent and trivalent cobalt species. To determine the extent of reduction of the Co/SiO2 catalyst, temperature programmed oxidation of the activated catalyst (calcined and reduced at 500) was performed. The oxygen consumption corresponding to oxidation of reduced cobalt metal showed that only 35% of the cobalt had been reduced by 500 (assuming oxidation of reduced cobalt to Co304). Since complete reduction of an unsupported bulk cobalt oxide occurs by 500, it is clear that metal-support interactions decrease the reducibility of silica supported cobalt. Temperature programmed reduction of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 3) shows a broad single reduction step similar to the reduction of bulk NiO. The increase in 104 G.

Measurement of the hydrogen consumption during temperature programmed reduction of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst to 1000 showed that 0.97 mmol of hydrogen were required to reduce 1 mmol of nickel (assuming complete reduction up to 1000). The extent of reduc- tion as determined by temperature programmed oxidation showed that 74% of the nickel had been reduced by 500. Since unsupported nickel oxide is reduced completely by 500, it is again evident that the metal-support interaction reduces the ease of nickel oxide reduction. 3.2. Hydrogen chemisorption The results of the chemisorption measurements (Table 1 ) indicate that the Ni/ SiO2 catalyst has a metal surface area of 6.6 m2/gcat compared to a metal surface area of 2.1 m2/gc,t for the Co/SiOz catalyst. The higher metal surface area of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst is due to a greater extent of reduction (as shown from the TPO results) and a higher metal dispersion. The lower metal dispersion obtained for the Co/SiO2 catalyst is surprising since increasing metal-support interaction is expected to stabilize smaller metal crystallites.

Reductive amination of ethanol Influence of space velocity The influence of space velocity on the activity and selectivity of the Co/SiO2 and the Ni/SiO2 catalysts was studied at 180 and a EtOH:NH3:H2 molar ratio of 1:2:10. Figs. 4 and 5 show the conversion and selectivity for reductive amination of the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts at ethanol space velocities ranging between 0.1 and 2 g/(gc,t h). As expected, increasing the reactant residence time results in an increase in ethanol conversion for both the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts.

Sewell et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 99-I 12 SiO2 catalyst is more active for the reductive amination of ethanol than the Ni/ SiO2 catalyst. Taking into account that the amount of reduced metal as well as the metal dispersion is higher for the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, it is evident that the turnover number of the supported nickel catalyst is lower than that of the supported cobalt catalyst. The reductive amination of alcohols has been proposed to be a set of reversible series reactions [ 3,18,19 ] as illustrated below (R=H, alkyl ). RCH2OH ~ RCH=O + H2 (l) RCH=O + NH3 ~ RCH=NH + H20 (2) RCH=NH + H2 ~ RCH2NH2 (3) RCH=O + RCH2NH2 ~ RCH=NCH2R + H20 (4) RCH=NCHzR + H2 ~ (RCH~_)2NH (5) RCH=O + (RCH2) 2NH + H2 ~ (RCH2) 3N 4- H20 (6) The initial step in the amination process involves the reversible dehydrogenation of the alcohol to give the intermediate aldehyde. This dehydrogenation involves the abstraction of an a-hydrogen from the alcohol and has been found to be the rate determining step for the amination of ethanol with ammonia [20] as well as the amination of octanol using monomethylamine [ 3,18 ]. Condensation of the alde- hyde with ammonia (or a product amine) forms an intermediate imine which may be hydrogenated to form the product alkylamine. It can therefore be concluded that the overall rate of ethanol dehydrogenation (Reaction 1) occurs more rapidly on the Co/SiO2 catalyst as compared to the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Attempts to observe the postulated ethanal intermediate in this study were unsuccessful. The monoethylamine (MEA) selectivity decreases and the diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA) selectivities increase with increasing ethanol conversion for both the Co/SiO2 and the Ni/SiO2 catalysts. This observation is in agreement with the series nature of the reductive amination reaction. At high ethanol conver- sions (i.e. low ethanol space velocity), the ethylamine selectivities approach the thermodynamically predicted values (MEA:DEA:TEA = 17:50:33 ). Comparison of the individual ethylamine selectivities at identical conversions of ethanol shows that the MEA selectivity is lower and the DEA and TEA selectivities are higher when using the Ni/SiO2 catalyst as opposed to the Co/SiO2 catalyst. In a reversible series reaction where the first step is the slowest in the sequence, a decrease in the rate of the first step allows more time for the products formed in the sequential processes to reach equilibrium (at identical conversions of the first species). This data supports the previous observation that the rate of dehydroge- nation of ethanol is slower on the Ni/SiO2 catalyst in comparison to the Co/SiO2 catalyst. G.

Sewell et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 99-112 Decreasing the partial pressure of hydrogen results in a large decrease in ethanol conversion for the Co/SiO2 catalyst whereas the ethanol conversion for the Ni/ SiO2 catalyst decreases only slightly. The large decrease in ethanol conversion observed when using the Co/SiO2 catalyst may be ascribed to cobalt nitride for- mation (Reaction 7) [ 12,19] since increasing the hydrogen partial pressure to its initial value results in almost total restoration of the initial catalytic activity. Although nickel can also react with ammonia to form nickel nitride (Reaction 8), it has been reported that only a small hydrogen pressure is required to prevent nitride formation [ 18,21,22]. The slight decline in activity observed for the Ni/ SiO2 catalyst as the hydrogen pressure is reduced is probably due to the deposition of carbonaceous material, as returning the hydrogen pressure to its original value does not result in complete restoration of the catalytic activity. 3Co + NH3 ~ Co3N + 1.5H2 (7) 3Ni+NH3 ~ Ni3N+ 1.5H2 (8) Decreasing the hydrogen partial pressure results in a large decrease in the selec- tivity to ethylamine product, principally due to the formation of diethylether byprod- uct. Although the mechanism of formation of diethylether is uncertain, it might be due to an acid catalysed condensation of ethanol by support silanol groups. MEA content increases whilst DEA and TEA contents decrease within the fraction of ethylamines with decreasing partial pressures of hydrogen. It thus appears that hydrogen is required for the sequential conversion of MEA to DEA and TEA. This is consistent with the postulated reaction mechanism where the imine intermediate must first be hydrogenated to form the amine before further reaction can occur. The higher MEA selectivities obtained when using the Co/SiO2 catalyst can thus pos- sibly be ascribed to the lower hydrogenation activity of cobalt as compared to nickel. Influence of ammonia partial pressure The influence of ammonia partial pressure on the activity and selectivity of the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts was studied at 180, an ethanol WHSV of 0.25 g/(g~t h) and a EtOH:H2 molar ratio of 1:10. The total flow rate was adjusted to 300 ml(NTP)/min using nitrogen in order to keep the partial pressures of the other reactants constant. Figs 8 and 9 show the conversion and selectivity obtained using the Co/SiO2 and the Ni/SiO2 catalysts as the ammonia partial pressure is varied between 1.4 and 5.6 kPa. Increasing the partial pressure of ammonia resulted in a decrease in conversion for both the Co/SiOz and the Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Since the slowest step during the amination of ethanol appears to be the dehydrogenation of ethanol (i.e. not involv- ing ammonia), the decrease in ethanol conversion might be due to increased cobalt and nickel nitride formation with increasing ammonia partial pressure. Alterna- tively, the decrease in ethanol conversion could be due to competitive adsorption of ammonia. The greater decrease in ethanol conversion obtained when using the G.

Co/SiO2 catalyst is in agreement with the greater decrease in ethanol conversion obtained when decreasing the hydrogen partial pressure. Cobalt and nickel nitride are inactive for reductive amination [21,22]. Increasing the partial pressure of ammonia results in an increase in MEA selec- tivity and a decrease in DEA and TEA selectivities for both catalysts. Although the reaction products are not at equilibrium, the changes in ethylamine selectivity with changes in the ammonia to ethanol molar ratio follow thermodynamic predictions.

Figs. 10 and 11 show the conversion and selectivity of the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts between temperatures of 140 and 200. Over the entire temperature range investigated in this study, the Co/SiO2 catalyst is more active than the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. For both of the catalysts, the selectivity to DEA and TEA increases and the selectivity to MEA decreases with increasing temperature. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show an increase in MEA selectivity, a decrease in TEA selectivity and a nearly constant DEA selectivity as 100- 75- .g 50: 8 >o 8 o Ethanol MEA C~ Cther __~ % Temperature (C) Fig. 11.

Sewell et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 99-112 I I l the temperature is increased from 140-200, however. Since reductive amination is a series reaction, this implies that the reaction is largely kinetically controlled under the conditions employed in this study. 4. Conclusions Silica-supported cobalt has been shown to be a more active catalyst for the amination of ethanol using ammonia than a silica-supported nickel catalyst, in spite of a lower active metal surface area caused by the formation of inactive metal- support compounds. It can therefore be concluded that the net overall rate of ethanol dehydrogenation, which has been shown to be the slowest step during ethanol amination [20], is greater when using a cobalt catalyst than a nickel catalyst. Under the conditions used in this study, the cobalt catalyst also had a higher yield of the industrially desired less substituted amines (MEA and DEA) and produced little unwanted byproduct, thus making the metal a promising amination catalyst. With the nickel catalyst, a further extent of the series substitution of monoethylamine was observed. The actual product composition can be adjusted by changing the reaction parameters to obtain the desired product spectrum.

Tel. (+27-21) 6502518, fax (+27-21) 6503775 The amination of ethanol has been studied using silica-supported cobalt and nickel catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Under identical operating conditions, the Co/SiO2 catalyst is considerably more active for ethanol conversion than the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, in spite of the lower measured metal surface area. The higher activity of the Co/SiO2 catalyst combined with its higher selectivity towards the industrially desired lower amines (MEA and DEA) make the metal a promising catalyst. Selectivity to individual ethylamine products (i.e. mono-, di- and triethylamine) is kinetically controlled and a function of the operating parameters as well as of the metal catalyst employed. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and hydrogen chemisorption have been used to characterize the physico-chemical differences between the catalysts used in this study.
