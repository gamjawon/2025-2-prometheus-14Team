Trimm * School of Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry, University of New South Wales, Sydney 2052, Australia Received 10 August 1995; accepted 10 October 1995 Abstract The autothermal conversion of methane to hydrogen has been studied as a function of the configurations of an oxidation and a steam reforming catalyst. It was necessary to pre-heat the bed to ca. 590 K when methane oxidation was initiated over a supported platinum catalyst: the heat and steam produced by oxidation facilitated steam reforming of methane over a supported nickel catalyst. A two bed system was found to be inferior in performance to one bed containing two mixed catalysts. Optimal performance (60%-65% conversion of methane with 80%-85% selectiv- ity to hydrogen) was obtained when both catalysts were located on the same support. Improved heat transfer is responsible for the better performance. Keywords: Methane conversion; Hydrogen; Nickel/alumina; Platinum/alumina I. Introduction Desired operating temperatures in a catalyst bed may be achieved by external heating or by combusting part of the feedstock within the reactor [1,2]. The so-called autothermic systems involve exothermic combustion of fuels such as methane [2-4] or methanol [1,5] to provide both heat and steam to facilitate endothermic steam reforming in the same reactor. Both small [1] and large [2] scale autothermic systems have been developed for industrial applications. The overall reaction sequence involves catalytic oxidation 3 CHaOH + ~-O2 = CO2 + 2H20 AH = - 677kJ/mol (1) CH4 + 202 = CO2 + 2H20 AH = -802.3 kJ/mol (2) * Corresponding author. Fax.

In the case of methanol, a supported platinum catalyst can initiate oxidation at low (ca. 273 K) temperatures in order to heat the bed to 473 K, when methanol steam reforming becomes significant [5]. For methane, oxidation is initiated only at about 590 K [6] and pre-heating of the bed is essential. This may be achieved by external heating or by combustion of product hydrogen from a previous run. Steam reforming becomes significant at temperatures in excess of ca. 650 K [2,7]. In order to avoid catalyst coking during steam reforming, it is necessary to maintain a steam:carbon ratio of about 3 [7]. On the basis of Eqs. 1-5, it can be calculated that ca. 60% of feed methane would have to be oxidised to produce sufficient steam. Thus, it is desirable to feed additional water to the reactor, in order to decrease the load on methane oxidation and to increase the amount of methane available to be steam reformed to hydrogen. Different arrangements of the two catalysts in the reactor may be expected to affect overall performance by affecting mass and heat transfer in the system. Jiang et al. [5] used a dual bed flow reactor to study the autothermic steam reforming of methanol. Water added to the feed was found to enhance heat transfer between beds. The Hot Spot reactor, developed by Johnson Matthey [ 1 ], also uses two beds but arranged concentrically. An intimate mixture of pellets of the two catalysts and the two active catalyst components deposited on the same support are also possibilities. The present studies were carried out to quantify the advantages to be gained by different arrangements of catalysts used for the autothermic steam reforming of methane to produce hydrogen. A platinum based system was used to promote oxidation, while a nickel based catalyst favoured steam reforming [6]. 2. Experimental The catalytic oxidation of methane was studied using a stainless steel tubular reactor (40 cm 1.3 cm diameter) fitted with a central thermowell. The catalyst(s) were packed between a-alumina pellets in the constant temperature zone of an electric furnace (necessary for pre-treatment of the catalysts). Flow rates of gases to the reactor were controlled using Brooks 5850E mass flow controllers. Water was pumped using a ISCO LC-2600 syringe pump. Exit L. Ma, D.L.

Gases were separated using a 1.8 m CTR-1 column in series with 0.26 Poropak N at 303 K before thermal conductivity analysis in a Shimatzu 8A gas chromatograph. Catalysts were prepared in the laboratory. ,/-alumina was calcined at 1273 K for 4 h to produce mainly 6-alumina (130 m2g- ~) which was crushed and sieved to 250-425 /xm size. Magnesia was also crushed and sieved to the same size. Catalysts were prepared by impregnation. The required amount of nickel nitrate or chloroplatinic acid was weighed and dissolved in distilled water. The resulting solution was adjusted to a volume ca. 2 the pore volume of the support and the support was added. After gentle stirring for 3 h, the slurry was heated to 330-340 K until dry and to 393 K overnight. The catalysts were then calcined in air (773 K Pt:873 K Ni) for 4 h. After loading in the reactor, the catalysts were reduced in hydrogen before their first use (873 K:4 h). The composite catalyst was prepared in the same way. Nickel nitrate was first impregnated and the system calcined (873 K:4 h). Chloroplatinic acid was then impregnated and the catalyst re-calcined (773 K:4 h). The catalyst characteristics are reported in Table 1. In two catalyst systems, 0.2 g Pt/A1203 and 0.3 g Ni/MgO were used: in single catalyst systems, 0.5 g catalyst was used. The appropriate catalyst combination was loaded into the reactor and the catalysts were reduced. The reactor was cooled and appropriate heat up experi- ments (see below) initiated. Once the system stabilised, bed temperatures and product gases were analysed. 3. Results and discussion The catalytic oxidation of methane has been found to become significant at temperatures between 590 and 720 K, depending on the methane:oxygen ratio [5]. The spontaneous oxidation of methanol and of hydrogen over the supported Pt catalyst in order to heat the bed to these temperatures was examined.

Initial experiments were carried out with a two bed system, with Pt/A1203 packed upstream of the Ni/MgO catalyst. Reduction was carried out in hydro- gen (773 K:4 h) and the system was cooled. Hydrogen and air were then admitted to the reactor until the temperature stabilised at about 588 K, when methane (210 ml min-1) replaced hydrogen into the reactor. Both oxidation and steam reforming were initiated and the temperature rose to ca. 800 K. Water (ca. 9 ml h-l) was then pumped into the reactor. After stabilisation, the amounts of air and water were adjusted to achieve the desired bed temperature and extent of steam reforming. Results are summarised in Table 2. It is clear that the conversion of methane and the production of hydrogen were both low. Variation in the steam:carbon ratio gave only small variations in conversion, the efficiency to hydrogen increasing and the maximum temperature decreasing with increasing steam:carbon ratios (runs 2, 3, 4). It would appear that the main function of steam is to increase heat transfer from the oxidation bed to the steam reforming catalyst. At the same steam:carbon ratio, decrease in the methane:oxygen ratio led to the conversion of more methane, to higher bed temperatures and to higher hydrogen selectivities (runs 4, 5, 7, 8). Results obtained using the dual bed system were then compared with a single bed containing the same amounts of both catalysts mixed together. Results are summarised in Table 3. It is very clear that mixing the catalysts produces much higher methane conversions (ca. 38%-92%) with improved selectivities to hydrogen. Thus, for 100 80 e, o e~ 60 4 20 0 650 t. .S S +,, J t.

The bed temperature is significantly higher than in the case of the dual bed, and this is reflected in improved steam reforming and in higher qualities of carbon monoxide. However, too much oxygen in the feed leads to high bed tempera- tures but to reduced hydrogen production efficiencies as a result of the low amounts of methane remaining after combustion (runs 15, 16, 17). Final comparisons were made with a reactor containing steam reforming catalyst impregnated with platinum. The amounts present corresponded to 0.5 g of Pt0.2Ni25/&A1203. Results are summarised in Table 4. It is seen that methane conversions and yields of hydrogen are slightly higher compared to the mixed bed system but that bed temperatures are lower. Thus, it would seem that -- as would be expected -- heat and mass transfer is improved when both catalysts are on the same support. Less carbon monoxide reflects the increased importance of the water gas shift reaction at lower bed temperatures. The importance of bed temperature to the conversion of methane is seen in Fig. 1. The balance between exothermic combustion and endothermic stream reforming is also clear. This is emphasised by a plot of the efficiency of hydrogen production vs methane conversion for all three reactor configurations (Fig. 2). At low conversions, most methane is oxidised to produce the desired bed temperature. At high conversions, the extent of endothermic steam reform- ing requires the supply of more heat via the oxidation of methane. The optimum balance lies at ca. 60%-65% overall conversion, producing 80%-85% conver- sion of feedstock to hydrogen. It is clear from Fig. 2 that all three reactor configurations are related in performance. The essential difference lies in the transfer of mass and heat in the L. Ma, D.L. Trimm / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 265-273 273 systems. The results indicate that, for the present studies, heat transfer is the dominant factor. The optimal loading of oxidation catalyst requires further study. Where oxygen is available, sufficient platinum is required to promote methane oxida- tion. The present level of ca. 0.2% was chosen by analogy with vehicle exhaust catalysts [8]. Once oxygen is exhausted, the platinum has an insignificant role in providing steam reforming at lower temperatures [6]. As a result, a two zone catalyst bed containing Pt-Ni/support near the fuel-air injection port and Ni/support elsewhere may be preferred [1]. It should be remembered, however, that slow catalyst sintering may require the first zone to be larger than first indicated. 4. Conclusions The autothermic conversion of methane to hydrogen occurs readily once the catalyst bed is heated to ca. 590 K, when methane oxidation becomes signifi- cant. Heat transfer between the oxidation catalyst and the steam reforming catalyst limits conversion in a two bed system. Much improved performance is achieved when the two catalysts are mixed together in one bed. Optimal performance is achieved when both catalyst functions are available on the same support. The arrangement facilitates heat transfer between exothermic oxidation and endother- mic steam reforming. In the present studies, optimal conditions involved the conversion of 60%-65% methane with 80%-85% selectivity to hydrogen. The optimal loading of the oxidation catalyst needs to be explored further.
