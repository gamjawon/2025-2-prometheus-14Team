The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid solution is a significant challenge for non-precious metal electrocatalysts based on the transition metals although they have shown good OER performance in alkaline solution. In this study, we synthesized the electrocatalysts containing two or three Co species (Co, CoO and Co3O4) nanoparticles on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) nanosheets which were prepared by a facile and low-cost synthesis where Co(NO3)2•6H2O and glucose were pyrolyzed in the presence of sodium chloride template. The Co3O4-dominated catalyst as-prepared, Co3O4/PGC, is OER active in acid solution (1.74 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2). We identified the OER active sites in the catalyst to be the Co3O4 nanoparticles rather than carbon-coated Co. Through comparative studies of the varied catalysts, we also proved that Co3O4 is catalytically more active than Co and CoO. The Co3O4/PGC catalyst, however, lost almost of all its activity after 100 voltammetric cycles in the 1.2–1.8 V voltage window. When the catalyst stability was examined potentiostatically at different potentials, the catalyst showed good stability at 1.4 V. The stability study also revealed the mechanism of the catalyst instability in acid was caused by Co3O4 reduction below 1.4 V and by Co3O4 oxidation above 1.4 V. 1.4 V is therefore a unique potential where Co3O4 nanoparticles are neither oxidized nor reduced to be susceptible to acid dissolution. Graphical abstract Co3O4 is more active than Co and CoO which co-existed in the catalyst. The catalyst instability in acid was caused by Co3O4 reduction below 1.4 V and by Co3O4 oxidation above 1.4 V. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Non-precious metal Active sites Oxygen evolution reaction Acid Stability 1 Introduction Electrochemical water-splitting and rechargeable aqueous metal-air batteries are components of clean energy technologies [1–4]. A key element in these applications, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is however kinetically challenged; necessitating the use of effective oxygen electrocatalysts [5–8]. Cost considerations for large installations logically rule out the use of precious metal-based OER catalysts such as IrO x and RuO x , which have the best OER catalytic performance [9–12]. In alkaline solution, the oxide and hydroxides of earth abundant transition metals (Co, Fe, Ni and Mn) and metal-free heteroatom-doped nanocarbon materials have shown activities close to those of IrO x and RuO x [13–22]. However, for OER in acid solution, which has theoretically higher voltage efficiency [23] and higher energy density [24,25], very few nanocarbon and transition metal oxide/hydroxide catalysts have adequate acid-proof properties and oxidation resistance to sustain a prolonged operation in acid solution under a high anodic potential. Recently, spinel Co3O4 has drawn substantial interest as an OER electrocatalyst because of its relatively low cost, high catalytic activity and good corrosion stability in the alkaline solution [26,27]. Since Co3O4 is known to be insoluble in non-oxidizing acids at room temperature [28], the possibility that Co3O4 may also be useful for OER catalysis in acid is there. The evaluation of Co3O4 as an OER electrocatalyst in acid, especially its catalytic activity, stability and active sites; is however missing in the literature. This is our effort to fill the knowledge gap by providing a systematic study of the activity and stability of Co3O4 for OER catalysis in acid. We synthesized spinel Co3O4-dominated as nanoparticles supported on porous graphitic carbon nanosheets (PGC) using a facile low-cost synthesis where Co(NO3)2•6H2O and glucose were co-pyrolyzed in the presence of sodium chloride template. The activity and stability of the Co3O4/PGC catalyst prepared as such for OER in acid were measured by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry and Tafel analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy were used to probe the structure of the likely active sites of the catalyst. We also provide a working hypothesis which rationalizes some interesting observations in the catalyst stability study under the OER condition. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The benchmarking 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst was supplied by Premetek Co (Wilmington, DE). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was used as the universal solvent. 2.2 Sample preparation For the preparation of the Co3O4/PGC catalyst, Co(NO3)2•6H2O (1.16 g), glucose (2 g), and sodium chloride (1.5 g) were dissolved in 10 mL deionized water. The mixture was oven dried at 60 °C for 48 h to form a composite powder. The dry powder was heated at 750 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under an Ar atmosphere and then annealed in air at 250 °C for 6 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, the powder was washed with deionized water to dissolve the sodium chloride; leaving only solid Co3O4/PGC behind. The following compounds were also prepared for use as the controls in comparative studies: (1) PGC by leaving out Co(NO3)2•6H2O in the synthesis; (2) Co/PGC by leaving out the annealing step in air at 250 °C for 6 h; and (3) Co3O4/GC (carbon without salt) by leaving out NaCl in the synthesis. The material phases in the catalyst/experimental controls were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using a Cu K α radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) and scanning the 2θ angle from 10° to 80° at 2° s−1. A FEI Titan 80–300 probe aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) operating at 200 keV was used for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer, with binding energy correction by referencing the C 1s peak of adventitious carbon to 284.5 eV. A Quadrasorb SI Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer was used to estimate the catalyst gross surface area from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms by applying the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) procedure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu DTG-60H spectrometer in flowing nitrogen (50 cm3/min) from 100 to 600 °C at the ramp rate of 10 °C/min. The OER activities of the catalysts were measured by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method on an automated Autolab type III potentiostat/galvanostat. The standard three-electrode configuration was used where a Ag/AgCl electrode in 3.0 M KCl (0.220 V vs. the Normal Hydrogen Electrode, NHE) and a Pt foil served, respectively, as the reference electrode and the counter electrode. All measured potentials were converted to the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) scale. The potentials versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to the RHE scale via the Nernest equation: E RHE = E Ag / AgCl + 0.059 pH + E Θ Ag / AgCl where E RHE is the converted potential versus RHE, E Ag/AgCl is the experiment potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and E Θ Ag/AgCl is the standard potential at 25 °C (0.220 V). Electrochemical measurements were taken from a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 1600 rpm and room temperature (ca. 25 °C). The catalyst loadings were 0.9 mg cm−2 for non-precious metal catalysts and 0.1 mgIr cm−2 for the 20 wt% Ir/C reference catalyst. Catalyst inks were prepared by dispersing the solid catalyst in a 1 mL ethanol-water (1/1 v/v) mixture with 100 µL of 5 wt% commercial Nafion solution ultrasonically for 30 min. The catalyst ink was then drop-cast onto a glassy-carbon disk electrode to the desired loading. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured in the 1.2–1.8 V (vs. RHE) potential window at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) shows the reaction sequence in the catalyst preparation. The sodium chloride particles were coated with a mixture of glucose and cobalt nitrate after 24 h of stir homogenization. Heat treatment at 750 °C in Ar converted the glucose/cobalt nitrate mixture into Co nanoparticles supported on graphitic carbon; and the ensuing heat treatment in air at 250 °C for 6 h transformed the cobalt to Co3O4. After washing away the sodium chloride template with water, Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on porous graphitic carbon nanosheets, or Co3O4/PGC, were obtained. The low-magnification TEM image of Co3O4/PGC in Fig. 2 (a) shows the porous carbon nanosheets and the dark 40–50 nm Co-based particles in them. A close examination of the carbon nanosheets by high-resolution TEM (Fig. S1) found them to be well-graphitized. BET measurements indicated a gross surface area of 233 m2/g and the preponderance of ~2.9 nm mesopores. The distribution of the oxidation state, size and form of presence of cobalt in Co3O4/PGC were analyzed by combining TGA, XPS, XRD and TEM. The Co content in Co3O4/PGC was 40.6 wt% according to TGA analysis (Fig. S2). The Co 2p spectrum of Co3O4/PGC (Fig. 1b) shows spin-orbit splitting characteristic of the 2p 1/2, 2p 3/2 states with two peaks at 795.7 and 780.6 eV [29]. The relatively peak widths of 2p 1/2 to 2p 3/2, the 15.1 eV peak separation, and weak satellite structures on the high binding energy side of the 2p 3/2 and 2p l/2 peaks; all suggest the co-existence of Co(II) and Co(III) in the surface [30]. On the whole the Co 2p spectrum agrees well with the XPS spectrum of Co3O4 [31,32]. XRD analysis of Co3O4/PGC (Fig. 1c) however detected crystalline phases of both Co3O4 and Co. HRTEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were then used to further analyze the Co species in Co3O4/PGC. HRTEM revealed two types of cobalt particles-those with a ~10 nm thick compact graphitic shell (Fig. 2b) and those without it. The EELS maps in Fig. 3 (a) identified the former to be carbon-encapsulated metallic Co and the latter to be Co oxide particles. The presence of the thick graphitic shell on carbon-encapsulated cobalt particles could have shielded the cobalt core from detection by XPS. In short there were two types of cobalt-based particles in Co3O4/PGC - the graphitic carbon-coated Co and exposed Co3O4 particles on porous carbon nanosheets. Fig. 1(d) compares the linear sweep voltammograms of Co3O4/PGC and Ir/C for OER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The 1.74 V needed by Co3O4/PGC to deliver 10 mA cm−2 of current density is large by comparison with the reference Ir/C catalyst (1.58 V @ 10 mA cm−2, or a difference of +160 mV). It is nonetheless a good performance on par with the non-precious metal and metal-free catalysts for OER in acid reported to date [33,34]. In order to identify the OER active sites in Co3O4/PGC, Co-free PGC, Co/PGC without the heat treatment in air; and Co3O4/GC without the NaCl template; were also prepared. Fig. 1(d) shows that the current density from PGC was practically zero, and hence the graphite carbon nanosheets did not contribute to the measured catalytic activity of Co3O4/PGC in acid. This leaves behind Co3O4 or graphitic carbon-encapsulated Co particles as the potential OER-active components in Co3O4/PGC. From the TEM and HRTEM images of Co3O4/PGC after 100 cycles of potential scans between 1.2 and 1.8 V in acid in Fig. 3(b,c), the exposed Co3O4 particles were completely obliterated but the Co particles with the compact graphitic carbon shell remained intact. Since the Co3O4/PGC catalyst at this time had lost all its OER activity (Fig. 4 a), the graphitic carbon-coated Co particles are stable but not an OER active component. By the process of elimination, the exposed Co3O4 particles are the OER-active component in Co3O4. In addition, Fig. 1(d) shows that an as-synthesized Co/PGC is also less OER-active than Co3O4/PG. XRD (Fig. S3) however detected the presence of not only Co, but also crystalline CoO and Co3O4 phases in the as-prepared Co/PGC. The Co3O4 contents of Co3O4/PGC and Co/PGC were however difficult to quantify experimentally. It is nonetheless reasonable to assume that it would be higher in Co3O4/PGC due to the deliberate oxidation of the Co/PGC precursor at high temperature. Since Co3O4/PGC with the higher Co3O4 content was more OER-active than Co/PGC, it can be deduced that the intrinsic activity of Co3O4 for OER catalysis in acid is higher than those of Co or CoO. This should derive from the higher valence cobalt ion corresponding to higher OER catalytic activity. The role of sodium chloride in the synthesis could also be identified by the comparatively lower catalytic activity of Co3O4/GC relative to Co3O4/PGC in Fig. 1(d). Fig. S4 shows that Co3O4/GC is rather heterogeneous in structure. There are large clusters of bulk-carbon. These material aspects resulted in a low BET area agglomerated Co-based particles and the support is non-porous of 28 m2/g for Co3O4/GC (233 m2/g for Co3O4/PGC). Therefore, sodium chloride templated the growth of porous graphitic carbon nanosheets with high surface area and consequently the uniform distribution of Co-based particles on the surface of the carbon nanosheets. Table 1 summarizes the most pertinent kinetic parameters (exchange current density (i 0) and Tafel slope) of Co3O4/PGC and the reference Ir/C catalyst extracted from Fig. S5. The Tafel slope and exchange current density of OER on Co3O4/PGC in acid are comparable to those of Ir/C (215 mV dec−1 vs. 152 mV dec−1; and 4.3×10− 5 A cm−2 vs 8.1×10− 5 A cm−2). The stability of Co3O4/PGC was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (rotating disk electrode, RDE) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the 1.2–1.8 V potential region (Fig. 4a). Since the catalyst had almost lost all its OER activity after 100 cycles, it can be concluded that the exposed Co3O4 nanoparticles in Co3O4/PGC are not oxidatively stable in the 1.2–1.8 V voltage window to sustain a prolonged operation. The instability of Co3O4 in acid was then examined potentiostatically at its open potential (~0.2 V) and at applied potentials of 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 V. Fig. 4(b) shows the LSV curves of Co3O4/PGC after 2 h at 0.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 V respectively. It was found that the OER catalytic activity Co3O4/PGC after 2 h at 1.4 V had not deviated from the initial activity while the catalytic activities after 2 h at the other five potentials (including the low potentials of 0.2 and 1.3 V) decreased significantly. This suggests that the OER-active Co3O4 nanoparticles in Co3O4/PGC are only stable at 1.4 V. At potentials below 1.4 V (0.2, 1.3 V), LSV measured the catalytic activity of Co3O4/PGC after 2 h at 1.3 V to be higher than after 2 h at 0.2 V. This reveals that Co3O4 reduction by the following reactions was the likely cause for catalyst instability below 1.4 V (Scheme 1 ). By comparison Co3O4/PGC was even more unstable after 2 h above 1.4 V (1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 V) that below 1.4 V. Most notably the current density after 2 h at 1.7 V was practically zero. The instability could be caused by the following oxidation reactions which proceeded at a faster reaction rate than the reduction reactions mentioned above. These oxidation reactions are shown in Scheme 1. Consequently, Co3O4 is usable as an OER catalyst in acid if the applied potential can be maintained at 1.4 V, which appears to be the potential where both the reduction and oxidation reactions of Co3O4 would only proceed minimally. 4 Conclusions In summary, we prepared Co3O4-dominated nanoparticles on porous graphitic carbon nanosheets by pyrolyzing Co(NO3)2•6H2O and glucose in the presence of sodium chloride template. The resulting composite showed adequate activity as a non-precious metal catalyst for OER in acid solution, but did not have long-term stability in the potential range of 1.2–1.8 V. Through the process of elimination based on the results of control experiments, we confirmed the exposed Co3O4 nanoparticles to be the only OER-contributing component in the catalyst. We also showed that Co3O4 is more active than Co and CoO for OER catalysis in acid. The cause for catalyst instability was identified to be the reduction/oxidation of Co3O4 nanoparticles below/above 1.4 V respectively. Co3O4/C is therefore useable as an OER catalyst if its potential can be stabilized at 1.4 V. In the future study, we try to solve the problem by the two ways: (1) the Co3O4 stability threshold can be raised to the potential required to support a current density of 10 mA cm−2 through surface modifications or other means; (2) the catalytic activity of Co3O4 at 1.4 V can be improved by the increasing of the active sites and the changing of the catalyst structure. Co3O4 may then be considered as a non-precious metal catalyst for OER in acid.

In this study, we synthesized the electrocatalysts containing two or three Co species (Co, CoO and Co3O4) nanoparticles on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) nanosheets which were prepared by a facile and low-cost synthesis where Co(NO3)2•6H2O and glucose were pyrolyzed in the presence of sodium chloride template. The Co3O4-dominated catalyst as-prepared, Co3O4/PGC, is OER active in acid solution (1.74 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2). We identified the OER active sites in the catalyst to be the Co3O4 nanoparticles rather than carbon-coated Co. Through comparative studies of the varied catalysts, we also proved that Co3O4 is catalytically more active than Co and CoO. The Co3O4/PGC catalyst, however, lost almost of all its activity after 100 voltammetric cycles in the 1.2–1.8 V voltage window. When the catalyst stability was examined potentiostatically at different potentials, the catalyst showed good stability at 1.4 V. The stability study also revealed the mechanism of the catalyst instability in acid was caused by Co3O4 reduction below 1.4 V and by Co3O4 oxidation above 1.4 V. 1.4 V is therefore a unique potential where Co3O4 nanoparticles are neither oxidized nor reduced to be susceptible to acid dissolution.",
