Iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles were prepared via heating an oxalate precursor in air at 500°C. The precursor was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and its thermal behavior was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The as-prepared iron molybdate was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique (BET), and its catalytic performance was tested. Fe2(MoO4)3 exhibits a very high efficiency in the catalytic reduction of the nitro group to the amine group in the ortho-, meta-, and paranitrophenol isomers. The reduction was monitored using UV visible absorption measurements. Graphical abstract Keywords Iron molybdate Nanoparticles Catalysis Nitrophenol 1 Introduction Iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 is probably the most studied molybdenum containing mixed oxide. Iron molybdate has important industrial applications as a catalyst in formaldehyde synthesis from the oxidation of methanol or in the oxidation of the propylene to produce the propylene oxide [1–7]. The reports encountered on iron molybdate also deal with its application as a cathode for a rechargeable sodium ion battery or for H2S gas sensing [8–10]. Iron molybdate has also attracted interest as a precursor to the formation of alloys [11,12] and as an electrocatalyst for the evolution of O2 in alkaline solution [13]. Several synthesis methods were proposed for the production of iron molybdate, including microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis [14], precipitation [15], the solvothermal method [16] and the hydrothermal method [17]. However, in all of the cited examples the synthesis involves the use of solutions, making these synthesis methods more costly as several steps are necessary including filtration. In addition, several factors other than the temperature are subject to control such as the pH or concentration of the solutions. All of this makes these synthesis methods expensive and more difficult to apply in an industrial application. In this work, we studied the catalytic performance of iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles in the reduction of the nitrophenol isomers to their corresponding aminophenol isomers. Iron molybdate was synthesized at a relatively low temperature using a simple and cost-effective new method where only one step is needed to obtain the final product and the key parameter to control is the temperature. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The iron molybdate catalyst was prepared in two steps. First, an oxalate precursor was obtained by the solid state reaction of a well-ground mixture of iron nitrate Fe(NO3)3,9H2O, ammonium molybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24,4H2O and oxalic acid H2C2O4,2H2O in the molar ratio 2/0.43/10 [18]. This mixture was then heated on a hotplate at 160°C. The oxalic acid plays two roles here: as a reducing agent of nitrate anions and molybdenum and as a complexing ligand of iron and molybdenum. Both the evolving orange/brownish gas corresponding to NO2 formation and the change of color of the molybdenum complex from white to dark blue is proof of the reduction reactions that occurred in the mixture during heating. The second step consists of the thermal decomposition of the oxalate precursor under static air in a tubular furnace open from both sides at 500°C for 2h to obtain the final oxide [19,20]. 2.2 Characterization Thermal analyses of the precursor were conducted via simultaneous TGA DTA using a SDT Q 600 instrument. The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Shimadzu X-ray diffractometer 6000 equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation (1.5406Å) source and a Ni filter. The patterns were recorded in the range of 10° to 80° in 2θ. The particle size was calculated assuming that the particles are spherical using the relation DXRD =0.9 λ/(B cosθ), where λ is the Cu-Kα wavelength, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) expressed in radians, and θ is the Bragg angle. The adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. The particle size was determined using the equation DBET =6000/d·S, where d is the density and S is the specific surface area. An infrared spectroscopy study was conducted using a Shimadzu 8400S apparatus, and the variation of the nitrophenol isomer (2-NP, 3-NP and 4-NP) concentrations during the catalytic transformation to aminophenol isomers was measured using a Varian Cary 100 UV–visible spectrophotometer. 2.3 General procedure for the reduction of nitrophenol isomers The catalytic performance of iron molybdate was tested in the reduction reaction of the nitrophenol isomers to aminophenol isomers. In a typical test, 40ml of an aqueous solution of sodium tetrahydroborate NaBH4 2×10−2 M was poured into 40ml of an aqueous solution of the nitrophenol isomer 10−2 M under continuous stirring at ambient temperature. The solution color immediately turns a strong yellow color, with an absorption peak located at 415nm, 393nm, and 401nm for 2-NP, 3-NP, and 4-NP, respectively. This change in color is due to the formation of the nitrophenolate ion. The catalyst (0.1g) is then added to the mixture while stirring. The yellow color of the solution vanished gradually due to the action of the catalyst. The reaction was monitored via UV visible spectroscopy measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Complex precursor characterizations To identify the result of the solid state reaction between oxalic acid and the mixture of Fe(NO3)3,9H2O and ammonium molybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24,4H2O, we first recorded the FTIR spectrum of the obtained complex (Fig. 1 ). Note that the spectrum is similar to previous studies of oxalate complexes [21–24]. The FTIR spectrum reveals the presence of a large band in the range of 1750–1600cm−1. The deconvolution of this band shows bands at 1709cm−1 and 1678cm−1, which can be assigned to the CO vibration of the oxalate group [23,24] and a band at 1624cm−1 corresponding to δ(H2O) [22]. The 1400cm−1 band provides another piece of evidence of the existence of the C–O stretch [24]. The 1316cm−1 region can be assigned to υ(C–O) and δ(OCO) [24]. Moreover, the 914cm−1 and 955cm−1 bands are due to the MoO stretch [24]. This result confirms the existence of a hydrated oxalate complex containing a MoO unit. Thermal analyses were conducted on the obtained precursor. Fig. 2 depicts the thermal curves obtained in dynamic air for this complex. A continuous and slow loss occurs for temperatures up to 141°C due to water molecules that can exist in the initial complex, corresponding to 5% in weight. The presence of water was confirmed by the IR spectroscopy studies described above. Next, a rapid and strongly exothermic loss centered at 203°C occurs, corresponding to the decomposition of the complex. A final small loss is obtained at 350°C. The total weight loss observed is 49% up to 375°C; no weight loss is observed beyond this temperature. This complex is subsequently thermally decomposed in air at a chosen temperature of 500°C to obtain the resulting oxide phase. 3.2 Iron molybdate characterizations 3.2.1 X-ray diffraction A solid sample is obtained from the decomposition of the oxalate precursor. The XRD pattern of this sample is shown in Fig. 3 . The XRD pattern is in accordance with the J.C.P.D.S. file number 83-1701, corresponding to the mixed oxide Fe2(MoO4)3 that crystallizes in the monoclinic system in space group P21/a with the parameters a=15.707(7) Å, b=9.231(3) Å, and c=18.204(6) Å and β=125.250(2)°. All of the peaks were indexed. The obtained 2 theta values are 14.37° (200), 15.86° (012), 20.09° (312), 21.03° (311), 22.36° (214), 23.54° (202), 24.37° (220), 25.60° (212), 26.28° (122), 27.18° (411), 28.07° (224), 28.48° (400), 28.97° (124), 30.73° (222), 31.43° (024), 31.98° (032), 34.64° (420), 35.79° (234), 36.15° (214), 36.44° (134), 37.05° (402), 38.15° (616), 40.75° (611), 41.57° (042), 41.97° (622), and 42.73° (035). The first two peaks were used to calculate the crystallite size DXRD. In both cases, the crystallite size was found to be 45nm. 3.2.2 Specific surface area measurement The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller adsorption desorption of the liquid nitrogen technique was used to estimate the specific surface area of the iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 prepared by this new method. The obtained value from this study is SBET =8.0295m2/g. Taking the value of the iron molybdate density d=3.645, the particle size DBET was calculated and found to be 205nm. 3.2.3 Transmission electron microscopy Fig. 4(a) and (b) shows micrographs of the prepared Fe2(MoO4)3. The sample consists of significantly agglomerated spherical particles with the dimension of approximately 200nm. The agglomerates are on the order of 4 to 5μm. The observation in the transmission electron is in accordance with the results from BET at particle size of approximately 200nm. However, this size value is not confirmed by the X-ray diffraction analysis. The smaller value (45nm) from the XRD analysis can be explained by the fact that XRD determines the crystallite size and not the particle size. Agglomeration of the crystallites results in the formation of particles of greater size. As a result, from the BET technique, there will be a lower adsorption of nitrogen molecules in the case of an agglomerated powder. In XRD, the crystallite size is measured, even if it is agglomerated into larger particles because the crystallites are separately crystallized. 3.3 Reduction of nitrophenol isomers The successfully prepared iron molybdate was tested in the reduction of three nitrophenol isomers in the presence of NaBH4. The results are presented in Fig. 5(a), (b), and (c). Iron molybdate was found to be very efficient as a catalyst. At the starting point, when we added NaBH4, a strong coloration of the solution due to the formation of the phenolate anions was observed. This formation corresponds to the deprotonation of the nitrophenol isomers. No reduction was observed with the action of NaBH4 alone during a period of several days. However, a rapid reaction, in which the solution becomes decolorated in all of the cases, is observed after the nanocatalyst is added. The higher peaks of absorption disappear, giving rise to new peaks located at 347nm, 328nm and 317nm for the 2-NP, 3-NP and 4-NP, respectively. These new peaks were assigned to the presence of the respective aminophenol (AP) isomers. The reactions were completed within 12min, 4min, and 9min for 2-NP, 3-NP, and 4-NP, respectively, at room temperature. This result illustrates the high catalytic efficiency of the prepared iron molybdate nanocatalyst. The important results obtained in the catalytic test indicate that this nanocatalyst is a potential candidate for the reduction of the nitro function. The kinetics of these reactions were also studied (Fig. 5-d). We consider the reduction reaction as a pseudo-first-order reaction as the NaBH4 is taken in very large concentration excess. A suggested mechanism for this reduction can be presumed as follows. In the presence of the iron molybdate nanoparticle catalyst (FeMoNPs) the BH4 − is dissociated to form FeMoNPs-H and FeMoNPs-BH3 − as reactive intermediates (Eq. (1)) [25]. Subsequently, the nitrophenol isomers are reduced by these intermediates (Eqs. (2) and (3)). In this reduction reaction six electrons are involved in the transformation of the nitrophenol isomers (NPi) to the corresponding aminophenol (APi). (1) 2 FeMoNPs + B H 4 − ↔ FeMoNPs − H + FeMoNPs − B H 3 − (2) 6 FeMoNPs − H + N P i → A P i + 6 FeMoNPs + 6 H + (3) 6 FeMoNPs − B H 3 − + N P i → A P i + 6 FeMoNPs + 6 B H 3 The plot of the ln(C/C0) versus time is a linear curve. The pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant was calculated from the slope to be 2.67×10−3 s−1, 7.11×10−3 s−1 and 5.38×10−3 s−1 for the reduction of 2-NP, 3-NP and 4-NP, respectively. Note that we obtain rate constants of similar order of magnitude compared to those of previous works [26,27]. However, in our case, we use very concentrated nitrophenol solutions in the presence of lower quantities of the nanocatalyst. Thus, our nanocatalyst exhibits very high activity for the reduction of the nitrophenol. 4 Conclusion The monoclinic variety of iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles was successfully synthesized using a new method. The efficiency of the as-synthesized nanocatalyst was tested in the reduction of the three nitrophenol isomers 2-NP, 3-NP and 4-NP. This nanocatalyst was found to be very efficient in the reduction of all of the nitrophenol isomers, with very high rate reaction values and the ability to reduce very concentrated solutions. These properties make this iron molybdate an excellent catalyst candidate for the reduction of the nitro group to an amine. References [1] M.P. House A.F. Carley M. Bowker J.
