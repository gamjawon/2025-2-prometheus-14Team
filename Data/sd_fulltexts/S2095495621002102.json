Graphic abstract Interfacial engineering established smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst, greatly improves the reaction kinetics, suppresses the shuttling effect and eventually promotes the utilization of sulfur in Li-S batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next-generation energy storage systems because of their high energy density. While the low utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics would lead to degradation of electrochemical performance and thus hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a double-shelled TiO2-graphene heterostructure (H-TiO2/rGO) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) and highly exposed active plane as advanced host material in Li-S batteries is designed. This rational structure not only provides sufficient active sites and lower bandgap for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also builds smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, which greatly reduces interfacial energy barrier and promotes the utilization of sulfur through suppressing the devastating shuttling effect. Combining the synergetic merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing the of LiPSs, the electrode (S-TiO2/rGO-1) exhibits superior rate performance and long lifespan (1000 cycles at 1C, 0.023% capacity loss per cycle) with high columbic efficiency. This work paves an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries and provides a new sight to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices. Keywords Oxygen vacancy TiO2 Heterostructure Li-S batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh g−1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) [1], along with low cost, environment friendly and abundance of sulfur. However, there are still obstacles hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Typically, the complex lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion and multistep electron transfer leads to sluggish reaction kinetics and weak cycle lifetime. Therefore, more and more efforts have been devoted to Li-S field nowadays, including construction of various kind of host materials (such as conductive polymer, carbon-based materials and metal oxide, etc.) [2–4], electrolyte additive and separator modification [5–8]. In particular, polar host materials with catalytic function to accelerate conversion of LiPSs have been intensively studied considered the steady interaction with polar LiPSs. Meanwhile, rationalizing electrocatalytic processes in Li-S chemistry to synergize the entrapment and conversion of LiPSs is of paramount significance [9–11]. However, well designed electrocatalyst with abundant active center, facilitating conversion of LiPSs and promoting the utilization of sulfur, is still required [8]. There are several strategies are verified to be effective to improve the active of catalyst from the view of electronic structure, such as surface defective engineering, nano-engineering and heterostructures [12]. Oxygen vacancies (OVs), one of the most common defects of materials, play a key role in catalyst. The formation of OVs with abundant localized electrons not only directly affects the adsorption characteristics of reactant molecules, but also suppresses the recombination of charge carriers because of the strong electron and/or hole trapping ability of surface OVs [13]. Moreover, the imbalanced charge distribution emerging around the oxygen vacancies could induce a local built-in electric field, which will accelerate the ions’ migration rate by Coulomb forces and thus have benefits for high-rate performance [14,15]. Studies have shown that the introduction of oxygen vacancies will lead to the formation of defect energy levels and effectively minimize the band gap of host materials, endow catalyst fast charge transfer from substrates to adsorbates [16]. When considering the active of catalyst, high surface area and high active surface is attractive for effective conversion of sulfur species. Double-shelled structure would supply enlarged surface area for tight interaction with LiPSs and abundant reactive sites for fast mobility of ion and electron [17,18]. Furthermore, it is reported that supporting reactive particles on electron-enriched substances to form heterojunctions can strongly influence the activity of catalysts through effective electron flow at the heterojunction interface [19–22]. Nevertheless, the current situation is that the promotion of active sites is still deficient for fast catalysis of sulfur species. In order to explore catalyst with enhanced sulfur redox kinetics, interface-engineering design become more and more critical. It is reported that heterostructures would construct smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalysts, which can efficiently reduce electron/ion-transfer barriers, resulting in improved sulfur utilization and stable operation of Li-S batteries [23]. In addition, lattice matching may be related to the consistent orientation of component and have effect on the construction of interface. However, the research on heterostructure catalysts is still in the early stage, and the most suitable crystal texture coupled between components is not considered yet. Therefore, it is imperative to study relevant materials and synthetic design to establish host material with highly active surface and smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries [24]. Here we report a strategy to synthesize defective TiO2/rGO heterostructure with highly exposed of (001) plane (H-TiO2/rGO) as host for lithium-sulfur batteries. This double shelled structure not only maximizes active surface area to anchor and catalyze sulfur species, but also confines sulfur species in cathode area. Results show that OVs and/or heterostructures would alter electronic structure of catalyst and significantly narrow bandgap, facilitating electron transfer for fast conversion of LiPSs. Moreover, it is found that TiO2 exposes high percentage of active (001) plane, matches well with (001) plane of graphene oxide, which is vital to build smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of catalyst to lower interfacial energy barrier and accelerate the kinetics of Li2S deposition. The synergetic merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing fast transformation of LiPSs yield favorable kinetics and lower the reaction energy barriers of surface catalysis [25]. Impressively, endows electrode superior rate performance and long lifespan (1000 cycles at 1C, 0.023% capacity loss per cycle) with high columbic efficiency. This work paves an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries and to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 microspheres TiO2 microspheres were synthesized according to our previously work [26]. Typically, 1.2 mL of KCl solution (0.4 mM) added into 300 mL of ethanol. 5.4 mL TBOT (tetrabutyl titanate) dropped into the above solution under vigorous stirring until the solution become turbid, then aged for 3.5 h and collected by configuration and washed with ethanol and distilled water for several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ℃ overnight. 2.2 Synthesis of double shelled TiO2@rGO composites Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was fabricated according to the modified Hummers method and the hollow TiO2@rGO microspheres were fabricated as our previous reference [27]. Typically, the as-prepared TiO2 microspheres were dispersed in 50 mL rGO dispersion with ethanol as solvent and stirred for 24 h to finish the encapsulation process. 1 mmol HCl (12 M) was added using as etching regent and then transferred into an 80 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed with ethanol and deionized water several times, dried at 60 °C in a vacuum overnight to obtain the H-TiO2@rGO-1 microspheres. Similarly, H-TiO2@rGO-0.5 and H-TiO2@rGO-2 microspheres were fabricated when the HCl dosage was 0.5 mmol and 2 mmol. 2.3 Synthesis of S-TiO2@rGO composites The S-TiO2@rGO composites were synthesized via a melt-diffusion method. Hollow TiO2@rGO composites and sulfur power were mixed with a mass ratio of 4:1 and sealed in Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel under Ar atmosphere, then heated at 155 °C for 12 h in oven. 2.4 Materials characterization The phase structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD-D/max2200pc, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). FT-IR spectra analysis was carried out on the Bruker TENSOR27 equipment. The morphology was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and field emission transmission electron microscope equips energy dispersive spectrometer (TEM, EDS, FEI Tecnai G2 F20). X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) spectra were recorded on MK-II X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with a multichannel detector. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out using Mettler Toledo TG/DSC3 + in the range of 30–550 ℃ with a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in N2 flow. The EPR spectra were collected by Benchtop Micro-EPR and UV–Vis plots collected by Agilent Cary 5000. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical performance was evaluated using CR2032 coin cells assembled in an argon-filled glove box. The working electrodes were composed of 80 wt% as-synthesized active material, 10 wt% carbon black as conductive additive and 10 wt% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as conductive. The mixed slurry applied on Al foil and dried at 60 ℃ for 12 h. The electrolyte was 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and 0.1 M lithium nitrate (LiNO3) dissolved in a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 vol %). Celgard 2400 membrane as separator. The mass loading on the electrode was about 1.5 mg cm−2. Batteries then tested by a galvanostatic charge–discharge testing system (LAND CT2001A, China) at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement were carried out from 1.60 to 2.80 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV S-1 or at different scan rates. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured within a frequency range of 100 KHz to 10 MHz. Both CV and EIS were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The electrolyte/sulfur ratio was 15 μL mg−1 for typical cathodes and 10 μL mg−1 for cathodes with higher sulfur loading. 3 Results and discussion The preparation process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 (a). H-TiO2/rGO with different dosage of hydrochloric acid were prepared as reference. The synthesis steps for H-TiO2/rGO double-shelled microspheres are mainly as follows: Firstly, amorphous TiO2 microspheres were fabricated by hydrolysis of TBOT. Secondly, graphene oxide was uniformly coated on TiO2 microsphere through electronic interaction. Thirdly, TiO2/GO as precursor was etched and reduced by hydrochloric acid under the assistant of ethanol to construct double-shelled H-TiO2/rGO microspheres [28]. Obviously, the surface of amorphous TiO2 microsphere (Fig. 1b) and TiO2/rGO is smooth (Fig. 1c), while the double-shelled H-TiO2/rGO (Fig. 1d) was composed with a large number of TiO2 nanoparticles. Synchronously, the surface became rough after etching for double-shelled H-TiO2/rGO microspheres. In contrast to H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and H-TiO2/rGO-2 (Fig. S1, SEM images, seen in supporting information), H-TiO2/rGO-1 microspheres reveal double-shelled architecture as shown in Fig. 1e. This double-shelled structure would supply sufficient inner volume for high sulfur loading and enough active surface with abundant active sites for fast conversion of LiPSs. In this process, GO was reduced to rGO, and abundant oxygen vacancies were also introduced into TiO2. Additionally, in the process of etching, amorphous TiO2 was transferred to anatase phase. The high resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 1f clearly exhibits that (001) plane of TiO2 is highly exposed, the tortuous lattice fringe reveals that rGO nanosheets have successfully combined with TiO2 microspheres. Generally, the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 is supposed to be preferred in order to minimize surface energy of crystal. However, (001) plane is usually considered as active and is more suitable with (001) active plane of 2D carbon substrate usually exposes [29,30]. Along this line, interface design and optimization on catalysts towards LiPSs regulation can serve as an effective strategy [23]. Therefore, H-TiO2/rGO heterostructures with suitable plane of (001) would be vital to design and construct smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs, which enabled by catalysts accelerating redox reaction of sulfur and boosting performance of Li-S batteries. Energy dispersive X-ray mapping (Fig. 1g) implies that the element of Ti, O and C are evenly dispersed in H-TiO2/rGO, rGO nanosheets are also tightly integrate with TiO2 microspheres. This close interconnection between TiO2 and rGO shell is believed to be helpful as conductive skeleton to greatly shorten pathways of electron and avoid phase separation during cycling [26]. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 1h implies the polycrystalline structure of H-TiO2/rGO. The TEM images of S-TiO2/rGO-1 shown in Fig. S2 also shows that sulfur has successfully loaded in the host TiO2/rGO nanospheres. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of H-TiO2/rGO shown in Fig. 2 a are well index to TiO2 (JPCDS No.21–1272), indicates that TiO2 was transformed from amorphous to anatase in the process of etching. The (004) diffraction peak at 37.8° is corresponding to the highly active TiO2 (001) crystal plane, it would be broader and lower if (001) plane is highly exposed, which also suggests the higher surface activity of anatase TiO2 [31,32]. It is obvious that H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 exhibits sharper (004) peak, while the peak become lower and broader for H-TiO2/rGO-1 and H-TiO2/rGO-2, verifying the improved reduction of ethanol with assistant of hydrochloric acid. Raman spectra of H-TiO2/rGO shown in Fig. 2b exhibit characteristic peak of TiO2 at 144.7 cm−1 Eg(1), 397.0 cm−1 B1g(1), 515.6 cm−1 A1g/B1g(2) and 637.3 cm−1 Eg(2) [33]. It is worthy nothing that the peak at 144.7 cm−1 would become boarder and slightly move to higher wavenumber when the hydrochloric acid increases. The band shift may be due to the existence of surface defects in H-TiO2/rGO results from reduction of ethanol with assistant of hydrochloric acid [19]. More hydrochloric acid, more reduction of TiO2 and more defects in H-TiO2/rGO nanospheres. Moreover, the ratio of D and G band slightly increases when hydrochloric acid increases, verifying that the dosage of hydrochloric acid affects the reduction ability of ethanol [34]. BET curves of H-TiO2/rGO-1 were shown in Fig. S3 and the value of surface area and pore volume were listed in Table S1, indicating that H-TiO2/rGO-1 exhibits high surface area with abundant active sites. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed to confirm OVs and electron configuration of H-TiO2/rGO. As shown in Fig. 2c, a distinct peak near a g-factor of 2.02, indicating the presence of abundant superoxide radical adsorption due to Ti3+ exists in H-TiO2/rGO [35]. Similarly, more OVs forms when hydrochloric acid increases. It is noteworthy that the peak would disappear when Li2S6 was added, implying the adsorption of Li2S6 by H-TiO2/rGO via electron donation from Ti3+ as shown in Fig. S4 [36]. In order to confirm the band structure of H-TiO2/rGO influenced by surface OVs, the UV–Vis was conducted (Fig. S5) and the Kubelka-Munk plots shown in Fig. 2d suggest that the bandgap of H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 is 3.06 eV, lower than that of pure TiO2 (3.2 eV) [37], and further decreases to 2.82 eV for H-TiO2/rGO-1 when the OVs increase. While it increases to 3.26 eV for H-TiO2/rGO-2, which may combined with XPS valence band spectra for analysis. As shown in Fig. S6, VB maximum (VBM) edge of H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 is 3.21 eV, while it decreases to 1.39 eV and 2.06 eV for H-TiO2/rGO-1 and H-TiO2/rGO-2, respectively. This blue shift ascribes to band bending induced by charge transfer at the H-TiO2/rGO interface until their work function reaches equilibrium [8,19,38]. Therefore, the electron donating ability of TiO2 is enhancing, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Based on this, the band diagram of H-TiO2/rGO thus concluded as shown in Fig. S7. In order to determine the change on the surface and the role played by surface defect states on the carrier transport, XPS was carried out and shown in Fig. 2e. The full spectra shown in Fig. S8 indicate that both H-TiO2/rGO-0.5, H-TiO2/rGO-1 and H-TiO2/rGO-2 contain C, O and Ti element, the detailed contents were recorded in Table S2. The content of Ti reduced with increased reduction, which may attribute to more particles coated by graphene were generated during the etching. For H-TiO2/rGO-0.5, binding energy of 459.09 eV and 464.76 eV corresponding to Ti 2p 3/2 and Ti 2p 1/2, respectively. The other shoulder peak at 457.65 eV implies the presence of substiochiometric oxidation state of Ti3+ [39]. In addition, the Ti4+ peak shifts to higher binding energy as hydrochloric acid increases, implying electron cloud density around Ti4+ decreases owing to the reduction of TiO2 and formation of more OVs. The calculated ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ (Fig. S9) obviously exhibits the content of oxygen vacancies increases when the increased hydrochloric acid improves reduction effect of ethanol. The altered electron structure will remarkably improve the electrocatalytic activity of H-TiO2/rGO owing to the high carrier mobility of electron and/or hole. Visualized adsorption test of H-TiO2/rGO-0.5, H-TiO2/rGO-1, H-TiO2/rGO-2 shown in Fig. S10 clearly demonstrates that H-TiO2/rGO-1 has stronger absorption with Li2S6 than H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and H-TiO2/rGO-2. In order to explore the interaction between H-TiO2/rGO-1 and LiPSs. The S 2p spectrum of pristine Li2S6 in Fig. S11 shows six characteristic peaks, the peak located at 161.72 eV and 163.42 eV can be attributed to terminal (S-1 T) and bridging sulfur (S0 B), respectively [40]. High resolution of S 2p spectra of H-TiO2/rGO-1-Li2S6 after visualized adsorption test were shown in Fig. 2f. The peak shift to higher binding energy located at 162.2 eV and 164.47 eV can be attributed to S-1 T-Ti and S0 B-Ti, respectively. This shift indicates lower electron cloud density around S center as a result of the formation of bridging bonds between sulfur and Ti atoms [41,42]. Furthermore, the peak at 161.35 eV corresponds to Ti-S bond [17]. Analogously, compared with H-TiO2/rGO-1, the lower binding energy of Ti 2p of H-TiO2/rGO-1-Li2S6 (Fig. 2g) demonstrates the increased electron cloud density around the metal Ti atom, further confirming the presence of Ti-S bonds. Synergistically demonstrates robust polysulfides chemisorption capacity of TiO2 with intense polarity and active surface with smooth heterojunction abundant OVs. In addition, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that the sulfur content of the S-TiO2/rGO-0.5, S-TiO2/rGO-1 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 composites to be ≈76.2% 75.8% and 77.6% (Fig. S12). In order to verify the synergistic effect of defect and heterostructures enabling electrocatalyst evolution for LiPSs, diffusion of Li-ion can serve as an alternative parameter to uncover the redox reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3 a-c, CV curves were collected with different scan rates from 0.1-1.0 mV S-1. All CV curves show two distinct cathodic peaks relating to reduction to Li2S/Li2S2 (R1 and R2) and an anodic peak corresponds to generation of S8 (O1). According to the Randles-Sevcik equation (1), ip = 2.69 × 105 n 3/2 AC 0 D 1/2 (1) Where ip is the peak current, n is the number of electron transfer, A is the area of electrode, C 0 is the concentration of Li+, V is the scan rate during CV measurement. D represents the diffusion coefficient of Li+, manifests the viscosity of electrolyte and catalyze effect of LiPSs conversion. Fig. 3g reveals the calculated diffusion of Li-ion in H-TiO2/rGO, it clearly shows that H-TiO2/rGO-1 composites own higher D-value both in reduction and oxidation process, demonstrating the synergistically catalytic conversion for LiPSs of defect and heterostructures. H-TiO2/rGO were assembled as symmetric cells to further evaluate the polysulfides redox reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3h, the EIS spectra of H-TiO2/rGO-1 delivers lower Rct compared to that of H-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and H-TiO2/rGO-2, indicating favorable charge transfer at the H-TiO2/rGO-1-polysulfides interface [43]. CV tests were also carried out to further illuminate the enhanced redox reaction kinetics of H-TiO2/rGO-1. Analogously, H-TiO2/rGO-1 composites occupy much more area in the range of 1.6–2.8 V as shown in Fig. 3i, suggesting that the H-TiO2/rGO-1 composites effectively shorten pathways of electron transfer and accelerate conversion of polysulfides. A 2035 cell was assembled with S-TiO2/rGO-0.5, S-TiO2/rGO-1 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 as cathode to digest the role of synergetic absorption and conversion in Li-S batteries. Fig. 4 a presents the CV profile of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5, S-TiO2/rGO-1 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 at a scan rate of 0.1 mV S-1. It is obvious that S-TiO2/rGO-1 composites own lower oxidation potential and higher reduction potential than that of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2, demonstrating lower polarization of S-TiO2/rGO-1 [2,44]. This lower potential during cycling verifying that S-TiO2/rGO-1 composites facilitate evolution of electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. Fig. 4b displays initial charge–discharge of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5, S-TiO2/rGO-1 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 at 0.2C. The discharge capacity of S-TiO2/rGO-1 during the first plateau can be 350.6 mAh g−1, which is higher than S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 with 249.7 mAh g−1 and 310.0 mAh g−1, respectively. This increased capacity demonstrating the improved absorption and interaction between polysulfides and S-TiO2/rGO-1. The distinct valley between two plateaus represents the Li2S nucleation point, the overpotential between the tangential line of potential plateau and Li2S nucleation point is a significant parameter to evaluate Li2S nucleation kinetics [43,45]. From this perspective, S-TiO2/rGO-1 exhibits lower overpotential of 24 mV, while S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 presents an overpotential of 34 mV and 32 mV, respectively. The lower overpotential suggests faster kinetics of Li2S deposition due to the lower interfacial energy barrier originally from smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, which is vital to promote the utilization of sulfur and suppress shuttling effect [46]. It is noteworthy that the initial potential of S-TiO2/rGO-1 (1.74 V) is also lower than that of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 (1.77 V) and S-TiO2/rGO-2 (2.17 V), indicating more polysulfides could be produced and contribute to capacity. Moreover, S-TiO2/rGO-1 displays longer active time and high active energy of Li2S, further confirming that more polysulfides generated to delivery higher capacity [45]. The Rct of S-TiO2/rGO-1 is distinctly smaller than that of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 according to the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. S13, demonstrating favorable electron transfer kinetics on the S-TiO2/rGO-1 surface. When cycled with the current density of 0.2C, S-TiO2/rGO-1composites deliver a higher capacity with steady tendency. As shown in Fig. 4c, S-TiO2/rGO-1composites present high rate response and good reversibility. The average discharge capacity can reach 1204, 1102, 863, 733 and 670 mAh g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C and 3C, respectively. The capacity can recover when the current density come back to 0.2C even the cells went through high current densities. This superior rate performance can be derived from rational design of host material and synergetic adsorption-conversion endows cathode high stability and durability. As shown in Fig. 4d, the S-TiO2/rGO-1 electrode exhibits high capacity with slight capacity fading. The charge–discharge voltage profiles of S-TiO2/rGO-1 in Fig. S14 also depict steady cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity of S-TiO2/rGO-1 is 1230 mAh g−1 and decreases to 1113 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention of 90.5% and low capacity loss of 0.095% per cycle. By contrast, although S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2composites exhibit steady capacity during cycling, the capacity retention is 73.1% and 73.6%, respectively (Fig. S15). There are two distinct discharge plateaus and one charge plateau, compared with S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-2, S-TiO2/rGO-1 electrode shows a lower potential gap than that of others, confirming the lower internal resistance and smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries [8,47]. Analogously, S-TiO2/rGO-1cathode presents distinct multistep discharge profiles and still observed even in high current density (Fig. S16), indicating good reversibility of S-TiO2/rGO-1. Based on merits of effective adsorption-conversion for polysulfides, we expect S-TiO2/rGO-1 to possess high utilization of sulfur to deliver high capacity and long lifespan. Fig. 4e depicts long cycling performance of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5, S-TiO2/rGO-1 and S-TiO2/rGO-2 in the high current density of 1C. The capacity of S-TiO2/rGO-1 becomes stable since about five cycles with a discharge capacity of 852 mAh g−1 and 657 mAh g−1 in the 1000 cycles, only 0.023% capacity loss per cycle. While the capacity loss of S-TiO2/rGO-0.5 and S-TiO2/rGO-1can be 0.052% and 0.049%, respectively. This high capacity retention suggests that S-TiO2/rGO-1 own efficient polysulfides absorption and conversion due to the highly active surface of host material and low electron transfer barrier on the S-TiO2/rGO-1-polysulfides interface. Compared with previous reported results, S-TiO2/rGO-1cell also exhibits a low capacity decay and long-cycle stability, as shown in Table S3. Fig. 4e shows that S-TiO2/rGO-1 electrode maintains a steady and high coulombic efficiency near 100%, indicating effectivity of S-TiO2/rGO-1 in suppressing shuttling and improving utilization of polysulfides as host material in Li-S batteries. Besides, H-TiO2/rGO-1 electrode exhibits stability and integrity as host material during cycling in lithium-sulfur batteries. As shown in Fig. S17, SEM images of H-TiO2/rGO-1 after cycling obviously reveal that H-TiO2/rGO-1can still maintain sphere structure after 100 cycles at 0.2C and even after 1000 cycles at 1C. The high areal loading of sulfur is a key parameter to evaluate the energy density of practical Li-S batteries. Therefore, H-TiO2/rGO-1 with sulfur mass loading of 3, 5 and 7 mg cm−1 were fabricated and assembled as cells. As shown in Fig. S18, a remarkable area capacity of 5.5 mAh cm−2 was observed when the mass loading was 3 mg cm−2. When the mass loading increases to 5 mg cm−2 and 7 mg cm−2, the capacity increases to 4.8 and 4.0 mAh cm−2, respectively. It can be seen clearly that even experienced high mass loading, the electrode also delivers stability and durability with high capacity retention, verifying the merit of synergistical polysulfides absorption and conversion of H-TiO2/rGO-1 [48]. 4 Conclusion In summary, we have designed a double-shelled TiO2-graphene heterostructure (H-TiO2/rGO-1) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) and highly active plane as advanced host material in Li-S batteries. As cathode host material, the double-shelled structure verified to be valid in providing sufficient surface area and volume for adsorption as well as high sulfur loading. Highly exposed plane and abundant OVs not only provide active sites for polysulfides absorption and catalyzing, but also greatly narrow the bandgap of electrode, enhancing redox reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries. Furthermore, this rational heterostructure design established smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, greatly reduces ions/electrons transfer barrier, suppresses the devastating shuttling effect and eventually promotes the utilization of sulfur. Combining the merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing of LiPSs, S-TiO2/rGO-1 composites exhibit superior rate performance and long lifespan with high columbic efficiency. Moreover, S-TiO2/rGO-1 composites also exhibit high areal capacity even in the high mass loading. This work may offer an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries area.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next-generation energy storage systems because of their high energy density. While the low utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics would lead to degradation of electrochemical performance and thus hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a double-shelled TiO2-graphene heterostructure (H-TiO2/rGO) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) and highly exposed active plane as advanced host material in Li-S batteries is designed. This rational structure not only provides sufficient active sites and lower bandgap for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also builds smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, which greatly reduces interfacial energy barrier and promotes the utilization of sulfur through suppressing the devastating shuttling effect. Combining the synergetic merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing the of LiPSs, the electrode (S-TiO2/rGO-1) exhibits superior rate performance and long lifespan (1000 cycles at 1C, 0.023% capacity loss per cycle) with high columbic efficiency. This work paves an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries and provides a new sight to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices.",
