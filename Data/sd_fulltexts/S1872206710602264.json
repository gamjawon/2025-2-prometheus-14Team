Molybdenum oxide nanoparticles were supported on HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 by incipient wetness impregnation (MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 ). High-resolution transmis- sion electron microscopy characterization demonstrated the formation of È–-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystallites with a mean diameter of 1â€“3 nm within the HAP matrix. The molybdenum oxide dispersed on the surface of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 showed good catalytic activities for the epoxidation of various olefins with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. The magnetism of MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 provided a convenient route for the separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture by a magnet. The catalyst was recycled at least five times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. Key words: hydroxyapatite; epoxidation; tert-butyl hydroperoxide; supported molybdenum catalyst; magnetic separation Olefin epoxidation is an important reaction because epox- ides are very useful intermediates in the organic synthesis of fine chemicals [1]. Molybdenum (VI) solid catalysts are widely used for the epoxidation of olefins [2â€“8]. However, the cata- lysts can only be recycled by tedious procedures using filtra- tion and centrifugation, which inevitably leads to the loss of catalyst in the separation processes. Recently, magnetic nanoparticles of iron oxides have received growing attention due to their unique properties and potential application in various fields, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, magnetically assisted drug delivery, hyper- thermia, magnetic separation of biomolecules, and isolation and recycling of catalysts [9â€“12]. Magnetic separation is a convenient method for separating magnetic solid catalysts for recycling. However, bare nanoparticles of iron oxides tend to aggregate into large clusters and lose their single-domain and magnetic nanostructures. Therefore, a suitable passive material such as a polymer, carbon, or silica has to be coated on the surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and improve their chemical stability [13â€“15]. Hydroxyapatites (HAPs) with the molecular formula of Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 are of considerable interest for their structural stability, ionic substitution, and adsorption capacity [16]. The hexagonal apatite structure is composed of Ca 2+ sites sur- rounded by tetrahedral PO 4 3â€“ units. OH â€“ ions occupy columns parallel to the hexagonal structure. HAP has these unique ad- vantages as a catalyst support: (1) a high ion-exchange ability and adsorption capacity, which are good for immobilizing active species; (2) a nonporous structure to avoid the problem of mass transfer limitation; and (3) weak acid-base properties that reduce side reactions induced by the support itself. HAP-encapsulated magnetic nanocrystallites as the catalyst support for olefin oxidation, alcohol oxidation, and dehaloge- nation reactions have been reported [17â€“19]. In this paper, we report the fabrication of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles dispersed on a hydroxyapatite shell that was coated on magnetic iron oxides particles. This was a highly active and magnetically recyclable catalyst for the epoxidation of alkene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1166â€“1172 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The synthesis procedure is represented in Scheme 1. HAP-encapsulated È–-Fe 2 O 3 (HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 ) was prepared ac- cording to a previously reported method [18]. The detailed procedure was as follows. FeCl 2 Â·4H 2 O (1.85 mmol) and FeCl 3 Â·6H 2 O (3.7 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (30 ml) under an Ar atmosphere at room temperature. The resulting solution was added to a 25 wt% NH 4 OH solution (10 ml) under vigorous mechanical stirring (300 r/min). A black precipitate of Fe 3 O 4 was produced. In order to get small and uniform Fe 3 O 4 particles, the drop rate of NH 4 OH was controlled precisely by a constant dropper. The drop time was 10 min. After 15 min, 100 ml of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 Â·4H 2 O (33.7 mmol, 0.5 mol/L) and (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 (20 mmol, 3.0 mol/L) solutions with their pH adjusted to 11 were added dropwise to the precipitate over 30 min under mechanical stirring. The resulting milky solution was heated to 90 o C. After 2 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and aged overnight. The dark brown precipitate formed was filtered, washed repeatedly with deionized water until the water was neutral, and then air dried under vacuum at room tem- perature. The synthesized sample was calcined at 300 o C for 3 h. The color of the powder changed from deep black to red- dish-brown after calcination, indicating the transformation of the magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) cores to hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). The MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The required amount of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 Â· 4H 2 O was dissolved in distilled water. HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 (1.0 g) was added into the stirred solution at 80 o C, and the water was completely evaporated. The MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was obtained after the solid material was calcined at 550 o C for 3 h in air. 1.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a PANalytical Xâ€™pert Pro diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG ESCALAB 210 spectrometer. All binding energies were calibrated using the C 2p peak at 285.0 eV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope. High- resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs were obtained with a JEM-2010 electron microscope. BET surface area measure- ments were performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 in- strument at liquid nitrogen temperature. Magnetic properties were characterized by a VSM by Lakeshore 7304. The mag- netism of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 was investigated using a supercon- ducting quantum interface device magnetometer. 1.3 Catalytic tests The activity of the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was tested with the epoxidation of olefin. In a typical experiment, a mix- ture of substrate (5 mmol), TBHP (70 wt%, 5 mmol), and 25 mg of MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 in 6 ml chloroform was introduced into a 50 ml glass reactor with vigorous stirring. The reaction was maintained for 8 h to get a high conversion. Qualitative analysis was conducted with a HP 6890/5973 GCMS with Chemstation and the NIST mass spectral database. Quantita- tive analysis was conducted with an Agilent 6820 GC equipped with an FID. The reusability of the catalyst was tested as follows. After the reaction, a bar magnet was used to keep the MoO x /HAP- È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst on the side wall of the reactor while the reac- tion solution was removed. The catalyst was washed repeatedly with chloroform. Alkene, chloroform, and TBHP were then added to start the next run. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization results 2.1.1 Textural, chemical, and physical properties Figure 1 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples. All samples showed a Type IV isotherm with a Type H2 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of well-developed mesoporosity in all the samples. Table 1 summarizes the physicochemical parameters of the catalysts. As compared with HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , the BET surface area and specific pore volume of MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 were obviously smaller while the pore diameter was increased. This was because molybdenum oxide particles have blocked some of the pores when they were deposited, which suggested that (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 MoO x NH 4 OH Fe 3 O 4 HAP Calcination FeCl 2 + FeCl 3 1) CaP 2) È–-Fe 2 O 3 HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 HAP È–-Fe 2 O 3 MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 Scheme 1. Synthesis of MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 . YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1166â€“1172 molybdenum oxide can be easily fixed on the surface of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 by conventional incipient wetness impregnation. It should be noted that the changes in BET surface area, spe- cific pore volume, and pore diameter increased abruptly when the Mo loading exceeded 20 wt%, which was attributed to the agglomeration of molybdenum oxide. 2.1.2 XRD The powder XRD patterns of HAP, HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , Mo/HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , and MoO 3 samples are shown in Fig. 2. Seven well-resolved diffraction peaks of pure HAP (2È™ = 25.9 o , 31.8 o , 32.9 o , 34.1 o , 39.8 o , 46.7 o , and 49.5 o ) were clearly ob- served with HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 and all the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts, confirming the formation of the HAP phase. The diffraction peaks of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 were weak, which was probably due to the small size of the particles [18]. As com- pared with pure È–-Fe 2 O 3 [20,21], HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 exhibited clear diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 30.2 o , 35.7 o , and 43.6 o , which were assigned to the (220), (311), and (400) reflections of È–-Fe 2 O 3 , respectively. Other iron oxide phases such as Ä®-Fe 2 O 3 (2È™ = 24.1 o , 33.1 o , 35.6 o , 40.8 o , 54.1 o , and 63.9 o ) were not detected. The diffraction line of MoO 3 was absent in the diffractograms of the catalysts with Mo content lower than 30 wt%. It is worth noting that two new diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 18.5 o and 28.7 o appeared with all the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts, which were not seen with HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 and MoO 3 . The appearance of these two new peaks indicated that molybdenum oxide phases that were different from MoO 3 were formed on the surface of the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts. As compared with the fresh catalyst, there was no change in the characteristic diffraction peaks of the spent MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst after six recy- cles, indicating the high stability of the catalyst. 2.1.3 XPS XPS binding energies and intensities of the surface elements provide information on the chemical states and relative quan- tities of the surface compounds. Figure 3 shows the Mo 3d spectra of the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts as a function of molybdenum content. Assignment of the Mo on the supports was possible using the spectra of pure MoO 3 as reference. The Mo binding energies in MoO 3 (E b (Mo 3d 5/2 ) = 233.1 eV, E b (Mo 3d 3/2 ) = 236.2 eV) were similar to that of the MoO x /HAP- È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts. As compared with pure MoO 3 , the Mo binding energies of all the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts with different Mo loadings were shifted to lower binding energies, indicating that there was electron transfer from the support to the Mo species on the surface of the catalysts. This result also confirmed that there existed chemical interactions between Mo and the HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 support, which was consistent with the XRD result.

XRD patterns of HAP, HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , and MoO 3 . YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1166â€“1172 HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was 232.5 eV, which agreed with that of MoO 4 2 reported previously [22]. Therefore, the main Mo peak of this catalyst was explained by the presence of a mixture of MoO 3 and MoO 4 2 . In addition, as seen from Fig. 3, the XPS signal intensity of Mo 3d increased with Mo content. 2.1.4 HRTEM Figure 4 shows the HRTEM images. Figure 4(a) showed a clear image that È–-Fe 2 O 3 was coated with a layer HAP. The È–-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystallites were uniformly distributed within the host HAP matrix with diameters of 1 3 nm, which were smaller than those in the results reported by Mori et al. [18]. The micrograph of 20 wt% MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 is shown in Fig. 4(b). Dark amorphous nano-particles of molybdenum oxide with a size distribution of 20 50 nm existed on the sur- face of HAP, which was consistent with the XRD result. The diffraction pattern (the inset in Fig. 4(a)) exhibited atomic lattice fringes corresponding to the (220), (311), and (400) planes of È–-Fe 2 O 3 , which was in good agreement with those obtained from XRD described earlier [23]. 2.1.5 Magnetic hysteresis loop Figure 5 shows the magnetic hysteresis loop of HAP- È–-Fe 2 O 3 . As shown in Fig. 5, the isothermal magnetization curve of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 displayed a rapid increase with in- creasing applied magnetic field, with a saturation magnetiza- tion (M s ) value of 7 emu/g. Taken into consideration the È–-Fe 2 O 3 content in the sample (12 wt%), the M s value of 58 emu/g for È–-Fe 2 O 3 encapsulated in the mesoporous tita- nium-silica shell was smaller than the theoretical M s value of 76 emu/g for bulk È–-Fe 2 O 3 [24], which can be explained by the size effect degradation of the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanocrystallites [25]. 2.2 Catalytic test The catalytic activities of the various catalysts for the ep- oxidation of cyclohexene under different reaction conditions are shown in Table 2. In the absence of a catalyst (entry 1), cyclohexene gave only 27.1% conversion and no epoxide was found. Since the carrier of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 gave a similar result to that with no catalyst, the carrier was not active (entry 2). MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 gave very high conversion and epoxide selectivity, which indicated that molybdenum oxide was the active component and confirmed the existence of molybdenum oxide on the surface of MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 .

Magnetic hysteresis loop of HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 . YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1166â€“1172 with different molybdenum content were tested (entries 3â€“6). When the molybdenum content increased from 5 wt% to 20 wt%, the cyclohexene conversion and epoxide selectivity in- creased gradually. However, when the molybdenum content was > 20 wt%, the epoxide selectivity decreased, which was probably due to the increase of side reactions caused by the agglomeration of molybdenum oxide. 20 wt% MoO x /HAP- È–-Fe 2 O 3 showed 90.8% cyclohexene conversion and 98.7% epoxide selectivity, which were higher than those reported previously for this reaction using Mo-based catalysts [2â€“6]. Taking into account the cyclohexene conversion as well as the epoxide selectivity, 20 wt% MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 was the best for the epoxidation of cyclohexene. Various solvents were examined to find the appropriate conditions for the reaction (entries 5, 7â€“9). The performance of this catalyst was significantly solvent dependent, with CHCl 3 giving the best result. The temperature dependence of cyclohexene epoxidation was also investigated (entries 5, 10, and 11). Cyclohexene conversion and epoxide selectivity strongly depended on the reaction temperature, which was consistent with the results in a previous report [26]. When the reaction was performed at 30 o C, the conversion of cyclohexene and selectivity for epoxide were very low. As the temperature increased, both the conver- sion of cyclohexene and selectivity for epoxide increased. A cyclohexene conversion of 90.8% and epoxide selectivity of 98.7% were obtained at 70 o C. The present catalyst afforded a simple way for separating the catalyst from the reaction mixture due to the heterogeneous nature and magnetic properties of the catalyst. This is shown in Fig. 6. The catalyst was easily recoverable by using an external permanent magnet. We also investigated the recycling of the catalyst. It was successfully recycled and reused six times in the epoxidation of cyclohexene with no significant loss of activity, as shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the conversion of cyclohexene and selectivity to epoxide were almost unchanged after six reaction cycles. ICP analysis of the filtrate confirmed that the metal contents in it were negligible (Mo < 5 È�g/L, Fe < 3 È�g/L). To extend the scope of the catalyst, the MoO x /HAP-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was applied for the oxidation of a wide range of cyclic and linear alkenes with TBHP under the optimized conditions.

This catalyst showed several attractive features for practical appli- cations. First, È–-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystallites were dispersed within the HAP matrix. Second, the magnetic core was protected by hydroxyapatite, which makes its use under harsh reaction conditions possible. Third, the magnetic core allowed the easy recovery and recycling of the catalyst with no significant loss of catalytic activity. This magnetic nanocomposite catalyst should find applications in many other industrially important catalytic processes. References 1 Lane B S, Burgess K.

Tel: +86-931-4968068 Hydroxyapatite-encapsulated magnetic γ-Fe2O3 (HAP-γ-Fe2O3) was synthesized and used as catalyst support. Molybdenum oxide nanoparticles were supported on HAP-γ-Fe2O3 by incipient wetness impregnation (MoO x /HAP-γ-Fe2O3). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterization demonstrated the formation of γ-Fe2O3 nanocrystallites with a mean diameter of 1–3 nm within the HAP matrix. The molybdenum oxide dispersed on the surface of HAP-γ-Fe2O3 showed good catalytic activities for the epoxidation of various olefins with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. The magnetism of MoO x /HAP-γ-Fe2O3 provided a convenient route for the separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture by a magnet. The catalyst was recycled at least five times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity.
