The electronic properties and surface dis- tribution of Co in the catalyst were significantly changed by incorporation of the additives. The particle size of the cobalt species was re- duced, which strengthened the interaction between the cobalt particles and the silica support and decreased the reducibility of the catalyst. As a consequence, both ethyl lactate conversion and 1,2-propanediol selectivity decreased upon incorporation of the additives. Ethyl lactate conversion was related less to the size and surface area of the catalyst particles than to the distribution of the cobalt species and the re- ducibility of the catalyst. Key words: cobalt; metal additive; structure; ethyl lactate; hydrogenation Lactic acid, an important biomass-derived platform mole- cule, has been commercially produced by fermentation of renewable resources, such as sugars, starches, and xylose [1]. Much effort has been directed toward transforming lactic acid into high-value chemicals [1â€“9]. In particular, the selective hydrogenolysis of lactic acid to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO), an important feedstock for the manufacture of polymers and pharmaceuticals, is a promising and environmentally benign alternative to the traditional petroleum-based process for the production of 1,2-PDO [2â€“7]. Previous reports on the hydro- genation of lactic acid have indicated that Ru- and Cu-based catalysts are significantly more active, however, severe reac- tion conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure) are gen- erally required with these catalysts [2,6]. Pd-based catalysts have also been evaluated for this important reaction, but they require a relatively high temperature (>300 o C) for reasonable activity [10]. In view of the severe reaction conditions required for the direct hydrogenolysis of lactic acid, as well as the lower reac- tivity of lactic acid relative to that of lactate, producing 1,2-PDO by hydrogenolysis of lactate is advisable. From the standpoint of molecular structure with a reactive hydroxyl group, high reaction temperature is undesirable for the hydro- genolysis of lactate because of the potential for side reactions such as polymerization, dehydration, and transesterification, which decrease the 1,2-PDO selectivity [2,6]. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop active catalysts with the research of the influence of the support, the preparation methods, the nature of the active phases, and the use of metal additives. Bimetallic catalysts are of particular interest because they exhibit better selectivity, higher stability, fewer side reactions, and greater potential for reactivation than monometallic cata- lysts. Luo et al. [4,5,11] have extensively studied Ru-based catalysts with various metal additives prepared by a chemical reduction method for the hydrogenation of lactate. These in- vestigators found that various RuM/B (M = metal) bimetallic catalysts exhibit different activities and selectivities owing to differences in electron transfer between B and metallic Ru and differences in H 2 adsorption behavior resulting from incorpo- ration of the additives. Luo et al. proposed a catalytic mecha- XUE Jingjing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1642â€“1649 nism based on the synergy between metallic Ru and oxidic additives during the hydrogenolysis. Cobalt-based catalysts with various supports and metal ad- ditives are the most used catalysts for hydrogenation reactions in a variety of systems. Copper, zinc, tin, iron, and noble metals have already been studied as promoters for cobalt-based cata- lysts [12,13,17,28,35]. The addition of relatively small amounts of noble metals greatly enhances the performance of cobalt-based catalysts by increasing their reducibility [12,13]. Recently, vapor-phase hydrogenolysis of a lactate ester to 1,2-PDO over a Co/SiO 2 catalyst prepared by impregnation was systematically investigated [14], and a linear relationship between hydrogenolysis activity and the percentage of the bulk-like Co 3 O 4 in the catalyst was observed. In our previous work, we found that the method used to prepare the Co/SiO 2 catalyst significantly affects the liquid-phase hydrogenolysis of lactate to 1,2-PDO, owing to variations in the cobalt species formed [15]. The significant catalytic activities were in corre- lation with different cobalt species based on the inherent dif- ferent chemical phenomena during contrary preparation pro- cedures from the Co OH Co olation and Si O Co oxolation molecular mechanisms. In the present work, we investigated the effect of metal ad- ditives on Co-based catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethyl lactate. A series of CoM/SiO 2 bimetallic catalysts were pre- pared by a co-precipitation method. The catalyst structures were characterized by means of various chemical and physical techniques, including N 2 adsorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), tempera- ture-programmed reduction (TPR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the resulting information was used to correlate the microstructures of the solid catalysts with their performance in the catalytic hydrogenolysis of ethyl lactate. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The monometallic Co/SiO 2 catalyst was prepared by a pre- cipitation-gel method as follows. An aqueous solution of NaOH (4 mol/L) was added dropwise to a solution of Co(NO 3 ) 2 (0.55 mol/L) at a constant rate under vigorous stirring. A cal- culated amount of colloidal aqueous silica solution (SiO 2 , 40.0 wt%, pH = 9.0â€“9.5, Guangzhou Renmin Chemical Plant, Guangzhou, China) was added dropwise to the resulting pre- cipitate to form a gel, which was allowed to age at 80 Â°C for 4 h. The resulting slurry of the gel was filtered, and the gel was thoroughly washed with hot distilled water, dried at 120 Â°C overnight, and calcined at 450 Â°C under air for 3 h. The bimetallic catalysts CoM/SiO 2 (M = Zn, Fe, Cu, or Sn) were prepared in a manner similar to that described for the monometallic catalyst except that solutions containing the desired concentrations of Co(NO 3 ) 2 and the corresponding metal salt of the metal additive used. The precursors for the Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn metal additives were Zn(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O, Fe(NO 3 ) 3 Â·9H 2 O, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 Â·3H 2 O, and SnCl 2 Â·2H 2 O (analytical purity), respectively. The metallic cobalt loadings, determined by X-ray fluores- cence spectroscopy (XFS, PANalytical Magix PW 2403), were 19.6 wt%, 17.6 wt%, 18.0 wt%, 18.5 wt%, and 16.9 wt% for Co/SiO 2 , CoZn/SiO 2 , CoFe/SiO 2 , CoCu/SiO 2 , and CoSn/SiO 2 , respectively. The metal additive content was determined to be 3 wt% for all the CoM/SiO 2 catalysts. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained on a PANalytical Xâ€™pert Pro diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu K D radiation with a scanning angle (2È™) of 15Â°â€“80Â°, a scanning speed of 2Â°/min, and a voltage and current of 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The average Co 3 O 4 particle sizes were calculated from the most intense Co 3 O 4 line (2È™ = 36.8Â°), using the Scherrer formula. XPS spectra were obtained with a VG ESCALAB 210 spectrometer equipped with a Mg K D X-ray radiation source (hÈž = 1253.6 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The spectra were recorded in the constant pass energy mode with a value of 20 eV, and all binding energies (BEs) were calibrated using the Si 2p peak at 103.4 eV as the reference. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the cata- lysts were measured on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 in- strument at liquid nitrogen temperature. Both the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the samples were measured. TPR experiments were conducted with an instrument con- structed in our laboratory. A sample of catalyst precursor (20 mg) was pretreated in a He flow (50 ml/min) at 200 Â°C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. Then a reducing gas composed of 5% H 2 /Ar was introduced at a flow rate of 50 ml/min, with a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min from ambient tem- perature to 850 Â°C. H 2 consumption was continuously moni- tored with a thermal conductivity detector. TEM images were obtained with a JEM2010 electron mi- croscope at 200 kV. Catalyst powders were suspended in al- cohol with ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min, and then the re- sulting solution was dropped on a carbon film on a copper grid. 1.3 Catalytic hydrogenolysis Discontinuous hydrogenolysis of ethyl lactate was carried out in a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave at a stirring speed of 400 r/min. Unless otherwise stated, Co/SiO 2 and CoM/SiO 2 prereduced in a H 2 stream at 350 Â°C for 3 h were used. The hydrogenolysis reaction was carried out under the following standard conditions: 160 Â°C, 6.0 MPa of initial H 2 pressure, 2 g of ethyl lactate, 18 g of ethanol solvent, 1 g of reduced catalyst, XUE Jingjing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1642â€“1649 reaction time 10 h. After the reactor was purged, it was heated to the reaction temperature, and the H 2 pressure was increased to about 8.0 MPa and maintained at that pressure during the reaction. The liquid-phase products were analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a SE-54 capillary column (50 m Ã— 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector. The major liquid products included 1,2-PDO, 1-propanol, methanol, and ethyl propionate. Conversions and selectivities were calculated on the basis of a carbon described by Miyazawa et al. [16]. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 XRD analysis In the diffraction patterns of all the catalysts (Fig. 1), the broad and diffuse pattern clearly observed at around 2È™ = 21.7Â° was attributed to amorphous silica. In all the diffractograms, the catalyst precursor showed diffraction lines at 36.8, 44.8, 59.3, and 65.2Â°, indicating that cobalt was present mainly in the form of Co 3 O 4 spinel structure after calcination at 450 Â°C. However, these diffraction lines broadened and decreased in intensity upon incorporation of the additives, suggesting that the Co 3 O 4 particle size was smaller in the bimetallic catalysts than in the monometallic catalyst (Table 1). The Co 3 O 4 parti- cles in the CoCu/SiO 2 and CoSn/SiO 2 catalysts were much smaller than those in CoZn/SiO 2 and CoFe/SiO 2 . Interestingly, no diffraction lines pertaining to the Zn, Fe, Sn, and Cu in the bimetallic catalysts were observed, due to small particle sizes near or below the limitation for the XRD detectability [17,18] or the formation of oxide solid solution between cobalt and additive species [19,20,21]. 2.2 XPS analysis We used XPS spectra to investigate the surface composition and chemical states of the catalyst precursors (Fig. 2, Table 2). Considering the Co 2p photoelectron spectra for the catalyst precursors, the Co 3 O 4 spinel structure has already been proved to present on the catalyst surface from the typical Co 2p spec- trum [15,22]. The electronic properties of cobalt were changed by the incorporation of the additives: the Co 2p 3/2 peaks for all the bimetallic catalysts appeared at higher BE than the peaks for the monometallic catalyst (Fig. 2). The curve-fitting results for the Co peaks showed that the BE of the Co 2p 3/2 peak was shifted slightly positively by 0.4â€“0.5 eV upon addition of Zn, Fe, or Cu and shifted sharply by 0.8 eV upon the addition of Sn. These observations are contrary to previously reported results showing a decrease in the BEs of the Co 2p 3/2 peaks of doped catalysts, a decrease that was attributed to the formation of mixed spinel Co 1-x 2+ M 2+ x [Co 3+ ] 2 O 4 [23]. The increase that we observed in the BE of the Co 2p 3/2 main peak in the bimetallic catalysts may have been related to a decrease in the electron 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Co 3 O 4 SiO 2 (5) (4) (3) (2) I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (1) Fig. 1.

The relative intensity of the shake-up satellite structures centered at around 787 and 804 eV was also observed for all the bimetallic catalysts. All these XPS features were derived from Co 2+ ions interacting with the support as cobalt(II) silicate [15,24,25] and were responsible for the H 2 -TPR profiles at high temperature, as will be described later. This revealed that Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn in Co-containing cata- lysts accelerated the formation of cobalt(II) silicate. On the basis of our results and previously reported results for similar cobalt-based catalysts [15,17,26], we propose that both Co 3 O 4 and cobalt phyllosilicate were present on the surface of the bimetallic catalysts. The absence of cobalt phyllosilicate dif- fraction peaks from the XRD patterns may have been due to the amorphous structure of this species. BE values obtained from curve-fitting of the XPS peaks of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn indicated that all the additives were in an oxidized state in the bimetallic catalysts (Table 3). XPS intensity rations of the metal cations in the supported metal oxide to those in the oxide support can provide important information about the dispersion and crystallite size of sup- ported particles [27]. The Co/Si ratios in the bimetallic cata- lysts were lower than those in the monometallic catalyst, in- dicating that some of the cobalt particles may have been su- perficially coated by the additives. Both the strong interaction between cobalt and silica and the lower Co/Si ratio may have been responsible for the poor lactate hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalysts, as will be discussed below. 2.3 BET surface area and N 2 adsorption Incorporation of additives substantially affected the textural properties of the supported catalysts (Table 1). The specific surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore diameters of the bimetallic catalysts were clearly higher than those of the monometallic catalyst. The addition of Sn, Cu, and Fe sig- nificantly increased the specific surface area of the catalysts by ~30% and all the values were approximately 170 m 2 /g. It has been reported that increases in the specific surface area of bimetallic catalysts relative to that of monometallic catalysts may be due to the formation of cobalt phyllosilicate [28], as indicated by XPS. The pore volumes of the catalysts were increased by the addition of Sn and Fe, and the incorporation of Cu greatly increased the average pore diameter from 10.4 to 38.3 nm. 2.4 H 2 -TPR analysis TPR is widely used to study the reducibility of supported cobalt catalysts. Many variables, including Co particle size, support interaction, and reduction gas composition, are known to influence the reduction behavior and thus the locations of the TPR peaks of cobalt catalysts [29]. Knowing the species formed in the catalyst precursors makes the TPR profiles of such samples easier to interpret. The reduction profile of the monometallic catalyst exhibited two peaks close to each other, a low peak at 296 Â°C and a more intense prominent peak at 335 Â°C, indicating that two consecutive steps were involved in the reduction of Co 3 O 4 spinel (Fig. 3) [15,30]. The TPR profiles of the bimetallic samples were completely distinct from the pro- file of the monometallic sample. The presence of more than two reduction peaks in the former profiles indicated the exis- tence of more than one cobalt oxide species in the bimetallic systems. These peaks could be attributed to cobalt in various oxidation states and to various interactions of cobalt with the support surface. Taken together with the XRD results, the TPR profiles suggest that cobalt with low dispersion and large par- ticle sizes was reduced at low temperature. These reduction peaks in the TPR profiles were attributed to the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ and the reduction of Co 2+ to Co, respectively. From the TPR profiles, we can see that the onset reduction temperatures of Co 3 O 4 spinel for all the bimetallic catalysts were higher than the temperature for the monometallic catalyst. This result is consistent with previous reports indicating that the onset reduction temperatures of cobalt catalysts shift to lower temperatures with the incorporation of Cu and Zn [17, 28]. In contrast, the peak reduction temperatures of Co 3 O 4 spinel increased from 296 Â°C for the monometallic catalyst to 335, 339, 304, and 328 Â°C upon the addition of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn, respectively. The higher onset reduction temperature here could be ascribed to the decreased particle size of Co 3 O 4 , which is consistent with the report that small particles that interact strongly with the support are much more difficult to reduce than weakly interacting large particles [29].

This change may be due to reduction in the particle sizes of the CoCu/SiO 2 and CoSn/SiO 2 catalysts (Table 3), which is consistent with previous results indicating that the reduction of a supported Co 3 O 4 phase with small particle sizes occurs in a single step [31â€“34]. This possibility is also consistent with the XRD results, which indicated that the particle sizes of CoCu/SiO 2 and CoSn/SiO 2 were only 7.0 and 6.0 nm, respec- tively. The TPR profiles of the CoZn/SiO 2 and CoFe/SiO 2 catalysts were characterized by an intense peak at around 337 Â°C with a small shoulder peak at around 382 Â°C and two addi- tional small shoulders at 379 and 384 Â°C; the latter two shoulders were likely due to the reduction of small particles of CoO (arising from the first reduction of Co 3 O 4 ) and/or cobalt species strongly interacting with the silica support. Furthermore, high-temperature reduction peaks (>650 Â°C) characteristic of cobalt species interacting strongly with silica were also observed for all the bimetallic catalysts. These peaks may have been related to the reduction of the cobalt phyl- losilicate phase, as indicated by XPS. The incorporation of additives seems to have accelerated the formation of this phase, with this plot becoming much more obvious. Zn has been found to weaken the interaction between cobalt and titania as a result of the formation a â€œsandwich layerâ€� between the cobalt and the support [28,35]. Cu-containing bimetallic systems are reported to show markedly increased reducibility by sup- pressing of the formation of the CoAl 2 O 4 phase [17]. The main cobalt species formed in the calcination of the CoZn/SiO 2 , CoFe/SiO 2 , and CoSn/SiO 2 catalysts was the cobalt phyl- losilicate phase (Fig. 3). In contrast, Co 3 O 4 spinel was the main constituent of the CoCu sample, together with a small amount of cobalt phyllosilicate. On the whole, the TPR results were in good agreement with the XRD and XPS results. Undoubtedly, the presence of additives strongly affected the nature of the cobalt species in the catalysts by modifying their interaction with the material support as well as their reduction degree, leading to different TPR profiles. More importantly, the data also suggest that the catalyst surface was more similar to cobalt than to the additives. 2.5 TEM analysis Structural information about the cobalt catalysts was ob- tained by means of TEM analysis, which complimented the results obtained from the analytical methods described above. The TEM features of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were substantially different (Fig. 4). The monometallic catalyst exhibited small spherical particles (5â€“20 nm) that were evenly distributed on the surface of the support and showed good crystallinity [15]. In contrast, we observed two kinds of mi- crostructures in the bimetallic catalysts, spherical particles and a lamellar structure consisting of claylike lines, which probably indicates that both Co 3 O 4 and cobalt phyllosilicate were present Co CoFe CoSn CoCu Fig. 4. TEM images of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. XUE Jingjing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1642â€“1649 [36â€“38]. Thus, the TEM observations supported the results obtained by means of XRD, XPS, and TPR. 2.6 Catalytic hydrogenation We evaluated the activity of the Co/SiO 2 and CoM/SiO 2 catalysts for liquid-phase hydrogenation of ethyl lactate (Table 4). When the reaction was carried out over the monometallic catalyst, lactate conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity were high (90.4% and 95.8%, respectively). Incorporation of Zn, Fe, Cu, or Sn deactivated the catalyst, especially in the cases of Fe and Sn. The ethyl lactate conversions with CoFe/SiO 2 and CoSn/SiO 2 decreased sharply relative to the conversion with the monometallic catalyst (from 90.4% to 9.0% and 0.6%, respectively). In contrast, the conversions with CoCu/SiO 2 and CoZn/SiO 2 decreased only to 71.6% and 50.9%, respectively. As is well known, the activity of a metal catalyst is directly related to the reducibility of the catalyst, as well as to the number of active surface atoms, which is affected by the degree of metal dispersion and the strength of the metal-support in- teraction. Our findings indicate that the hydrogenation activity of the tested cobalt catalysts depended strongly on their re- ducibility. Cobalt metal is reported to be the active phase for lactate hydrogenation [13]. From the TPR characterizations we know that although the onset reduction temperatures for the bimetallic catalysts are lower than that of the mono-cobalt catalyst, however, owing to the formation of cobalt species that interacted strongly with the support, probably cobalt phyllosilicate, a large proportion of the cobalt species in the bimetallic catalysts could not be reduced to metallic cobalt under the prereduction conditions (350 Â°C for 10 h). As a re- sult, less of the cobalt species was converted to the catalytically active species after the pre-activation procedure. Thus, insuf- ficient prereduction of the bimetallic catalysts was likely the main reason for their poor activity. In addition, the surface coverage of the active cobalt species by the metal additives (inferred from XPS results) may have decreased the activity of the bimetallic catalysts somewhat. The selectivity of the reaction for ethyl propionate in- creased at the expense of 1,2-PDO selectivity when the metal additives were incorporated into the catalysts. This was espe- cially true for the Fe-doped catalyst, which showed an ethyl propionate selectivity that was twice the 1,2-PDO selectivity. The selectivity for 1-propanol was increased by the incorpora- tion of Fe or Sn. Also of interest is the fact that even though the conversions of ethyl lactate obtained with the CoZn/SiO 2 and CoSn/SiO 2 catalysts differed substantially (Table 4), the 1,2-PDO and ethyl propionate selectivities of the two catalysts were similar. These observations suggest that although the catalyst activity was dominated by cobalt, the selectivity was influenced by the presence of the additives. On the basis of the product distribution, we propose the following reaction pathway for the liquid-phase hydrogenoly- sis of ethyl lactate (Scheme 1). According to the literature, 1,2-PDO is formed mainly via direct hydrogenation of ethyl lactate over the catalysts rather than by a stepwise process (e.g., the hydrolysis of ethyl lactate followed by hydrogenation of lactic acid), as indicated by the lower amounts of lactic acid in the product distribution over a wide range of conversion per- centages [4,5,11]. Because ethyl lactate has a reactive hydroxyl group, hydrogenation and dehydration reactions are competi- tive during the liquid-phase hydrogenation of ethyl lactate. The product distribution suggests that the dehydration of ethyl lactate to ethyl propionate was preferred when CoFe/SiO 2 was used as the catalyst. 3 Conclusions We studied the effect of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Sn additives on the structure and catalytic performance of a Co/SiO 2 catalyst. Analytical results showed that the bimetallic catalysts had higher dispersion and BET surface areas than the monometallic catalyst. Incorporation of additives decreased the size of the Table 4 Effect of additives on the performance of Co/SiO 2 in the liq- uid-phase hydrogenation of ethyl lactate Selectivity (%) Catalyst X/% 1,2-PDO Ethyl propionate 1-Propanal Methanol CoZn 50.9 73.6 13.7 12.3 0.3 CoFe 9.0 30.3 65.6 2.4 1.7 CoCu 71.6 86.5 3.0 9.9 0.7 CoSn 0.6 69.3 11.0 5.9 13.8 Co 90.4 95.8 0.4 3.1 0.7 Reaction conditions: catalyst 1 g, ethyl lactate 2 g, ethanol 18 g, tem- perature 160 o C, H 2 pressure 8.0 MPa, reaction time 10 h.

The results of catalytic hydrogenation of biomass-derived ethyl lactate to 1,2-PDO showed that incor- poration of the metal additives profoundly inhibited the cata- lyst activity, especially when Fe or Sn was incorporated. In addition, the incorporation of the additives did not improve the selectivity for 1,2-PDO. The poorer activity of the bimetallic catalysts likely resulted from insufficient prereduction owing to the formation of a difficult-to-reduce cobalt phyllosilicate species. Our findings suggest that although metal and non-metal additives are widely used to improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts, the formation of diffi- cult-to-reduce species needs to be considered.

The electronic properties and surface distribution of Co in the catalyst were significantly changed by incorporation of the additives. The particle size of the cobalt species was reduced, which strengthened the interaction between the cobalt particles and the silica support and decreased the reducibility of the catalyst. As a consequence, both ethyl lactate conversion and 1,2-propanediol selectivity decreased upon incorporation of the additives. Ethyl lactate conversion was related less to the size and surface area of the catalyst particles than to the distribution of the cobalt species and the reducibility of the catalyst. 摘要 通过考察 Co/SiO2 催化剂中活性组分的结构变化及其催化乳酸酯液相氢化反应结果, 来研究第二金属添加物对催化剂结构及其催化性能的影响. 结果表明, 随着金属添加物的加入双金属催化剂中金属 Co 的表面电子性质以及分散度不断变化, 而 Co 物种颗粒粒径不断减小, 因此 Co 物种和载体 SiO2 间相互作用不断增强, 从而降低 Co 还原度. 乳酸酯氢化反应结果表明, 催化剂中活性组分的颗粒大小及其比表面积以及 Co 物种的还原度和分散度均影响其氢化反应的活性.
