Graphical abstract A thermal-induced phase segregation strategy is applied to simultaneously master material operando strain and reconstruction effects for the improved oxygen-evolving electrocatalysis. Material strain and reconstruction effects are critical for catalysis reactions, but current insights into operando strain effects during reaction and means to master catalyst reconstruction are still lacking. Here, we propose a facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to simultaneously master material operando strain and reconstruction effects for enhanced oxygen-evolving reaction (OER). Specifically, self-assembled and controllable layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel can be generated from pristine Li2Co2O4 spinel via Li and O volatilization under different temperatures, realizing controllable proportions of two phases by calcination temperature. Combined operando and ex-situ characterizations reveal that obvious tensile strain along (003) plane appears on layered Li x CoO2 phase during OER, while low-valence Co3O4 phase transforms into high-valence CoOOH x , realizing simultaneous operando strain and reconstruction effects. Further experimental and computational investigations demonstrate that both strained Li x CoO2 phase and reconstructed CoOOH x compound contribute to the beneficial adsorption of important OH− reactants, while respective roles in activity and stability are uncovered by exploring their lattice-oxygen participation mechanism. This work not only reveals material operando strain effects during OER, but also inaugurates a new thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to artificially master material operando strain and reconstruction effects, which will enlighten rational material design for many potential reactions and applications. Keywords Operando strain Structural reconstruction Phase-segregation strategy Operando synergistic effects Oxygen-evolving reaction 1 Introduction Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key for many sustainable energy applications, such as low-temperature water electrolysis, high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis, and metal-air batteries [1–3]. Designing and developing efficient, stable, and scalable OER electrocatalysts plays a vital role in the commercialization of the above applications. Taking low-temperature water electrolysis as an example, ∼80% of its total cost origins from the electricity consumption, where active and robust OER electrocatalysts can effectively reduce the electricity consumption [4,5]. In addition, understanding and mastering material operando behaviors is instrumental for the rational design and development of new promising catalyst candidates since many catalyst variations may occur during OER, such as ion leaching, structural strain, and reconstruction [6–8]. However, how to effectively and precisely master catalyst operando behaviors during OER is a critical but challenging scientific issue. Tuning catalyst structural strain and modulating material reconstruction behaviors are two most important phase-engineering strategies for catalysis reactions [6,9]. In terms of OER, pristine strain effects (i.e., tensile strain, compressive strain, and torsion strain) have been introduced into OER electrocatalysts as reported in the cases of Ag-doped Na0.7CoO2 [10], ball-milled NiFe hydroxide [11], and chemical-reduced Ba5Co4.17Fe0.83O14− x [12]. The introduction of pristine strain properties can well optimize the adsorption/desorption of OER reactants and intermediates to facilitate OER processes and improve OER performance. Whereas, whether the pristine strains can be maintained under OER and the real operando strain effects are still unknown. In addition, material structural reconstruction behaviors during OER have been widely reported in recent years, where amorphous hydroxides are usually formed [6,7]. Moderate material structural reconstruction can increase material surface active areas, generate new active phases, and create active boundaries to enhance OER performance [6,7]. However, excessive structural reconstruction can lead to the collapse and loss of active phases and further degrade OER stability and activity [13,14]. Therefore, controlling material reconstruction behaviors is core for catalyst OER performance. Three approaches have been developed in literatures to modulate material OER reconstruction behaviors: (i) doping dissoluble elements into raw materials (e.g., S, P, Se, and Al) [6,15–18]; (ii) introducing unstable phase into multi-phase compounds (e.g., unstable Ruddlesden-Popper phase) [8,19]; (iii) constructing pristine crystalline-amorphous combinations [20,21]. Although some attainments have been achieved via the above methods, new and facile methodologies should be further explored to effectively and precisely master material structural reconstruction. Herein, to simultaneously master beneficial operando strain and reconstruction effects for enhanced OER electrocatalysis, we propose a facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy. As a proof-of-concept, due to the volatilization of Li and O elements under different temperatures, pristine Li2Co2O4 spinel can transform into major layered LiCoO2 phase with relatively lower formation energy and Co3O4 spinel phase. With increasing calcination temperature, more Co3O4 spinel phase can be generated, realizing controllable phase content. Combined operando Raman, ex-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) before and after OER reveal that layered LiCoO2 phase is stretched along (003) plane accompanied with Li+ leaching during OER to form stretched Li x CoO2 active phase, while low-valence Co3O4 spinel phase facilely suffers from OER oxidation currents to transform into high-valence CoOOH x active phase. The regenerated Li x CoO2 and CoOOHx active phases exert beneficial operando strain and reconstruction effects for boosting OER performance, respectively. Specifically, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra further demonstrate that strained Li x CoO2 phase and reconstructed CoOOH x phase both help optimize the adsorption of important OH− reactants to accelerate OER processes. Moreover, we find that excessive reconstruction of Co3O4 phase worsens material OER stability. The detailed roles of strain and reconstruction effects in activity and stability are clearly demonstrated by uncovering material lattice-oxygen participation mechanism. This phase-segregation methodology for mastering material operando strain and reconstruction effects is expected to offer an important guidance for other energy and environmental systems. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis All the samples in this work were prepared via the sol-gel method [22,23]. Stoichiometric amounts of lithium acetate and cobaltous acetate were dissolved. Then, citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were added as the complexing agents with the molar ration of 1:2:1 for total metal ions/CA/EDTA. With continuous stirring, the mixed solutions were evaporated under ∼90 °C to form the gel. Next, the gel was heated under ∼250 °C for 5 h to generate the solid precursor. The precursor was further sintered at different temperatures for 10 h to obtain the powders. Other samples were synthesized similarly, where iron acetate was also used for the preparation of LiCo0.8Fe0.2O2 sample. 2.2 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a lab Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with a wavelength of 1.5418 Å, followed by the XRD refinement via the TOPAS software. Scan electron microscopy (SEM) mapping was performed on an S4800 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi). Raman results were obtained by an HR800 microspectrometer (Jobin Yvon). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) results were achieved on an iCAP 7400 instrument (ThermoFisher). FTIR data were collected from a NicoletNexus-470 spectrophotometer (Thermo). HRTEM images were taken on a microscope of JEM 2100F (Jeol). The hard XAS spectra were acquired at BL TLS 17C of the NSRRC in Taiwan, China (project no. 2023-1-192-1). 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The OER measurements were conducted on an SP300 workstation by using a three-electrode rotating disk electrode configuration (Pine), where glassy carbon electrodes (GCE), graphite rod, and reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The ink preparation and OER tests followed traditional protocols [12,22]. For the ink preparation, 10 mg sample powder, 10 mg carbon black, and 100 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%) were dispersed in 1.0 mL absolute ethanol via sonication. The sample loading on the working electrodes was 0.232 mg cm− 2 oxide. All OER measurements of the electrodes were conducted in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with a rotating speed of 1600 r min−1. 2.4 Computational methods All spin-polarized DFT calculations in this study were conducted via the Vienna Ab initio simulation package with the projector-augmented wave method [24,25]. The exchange-correlation function was handled using the generalized gradient approximation formulated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [26,27]. Effective U values of 3.5 eV [22,28] and 3.3 eV [29] were used for Co3O4 spinel and other compounds under the Hubbard U model, respectively. The van der Waals interactions were described with the DFT-D3 method in Grimme’s scheme [30]. The energy cutoff was set to 500 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled with Gamma centered Monkhorst-Pack mesh sampling (3 × 3 × 1 for all surface structures and 5 × 5 × 5 for all bulk structures) for geometry relaxation. A vacuum spacing of ∼15 Å was applied for all slabbed models. The bottom layers of the structure were kept frozen at the lattice position. All structures with a dynamic magnetic moment were fully relaxed until the average residual forces were <0.02 eV Å−1, and the total energies were converged to <1 × 10−6 eV. The Gibbs free energy calculation is operated using computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) mode [31]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermal-induced phase segregation Here, we proposed a facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to master material operando strain and reconstruction effects for enhanced OER electrocatalysis. We first synthesized Li2Co2O4 spinel in air at 350 °C (denoted as LCO-350) through traditional sol-gel method [22,23]. Then, LCO-350 spinel powders were further calcinated under higher temperatures to trigger phase-segregation processes. Specifically, layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase were generated under higher calcination temperatures (Fig. 1 a), where the samples at 550 and 1000 °C were denoted as LCO-550 and LCO-1000, respectively. XRD patterns and XRD refinement results show that LCO-350 spinel adopts a pure Fd-3m space group (Fig. 1b and Table S1), while LCO-550 and LCO-1000 are multi-phase composites composed of layered LiCoO2 phase with R-3m space group and Co3O4 spinel phase with Fd-3m space group (Fig. 1c and d and Table S1). Although both LCO-350 and Co3O4 are spinel structures with Fd-3m space group, the main characteristic XRD peak of Co3O4 is located at ∼36.7°, which is not overlapped with any XRD peak of Li2Co2O4 spinel and layered LiCoO2 structure in line with literature [32]. This makes XRD refinement quite precise to determine the percentage content of each phase (Table S1). It is worth noting that with increasing calcination temperatures, the proportion of Co3O4 spinel phase increases from ∼10.7 wt% in LCO-550 to ∼21.4 wt% in LCO-1000, realizing controllable phase content. The uniform mixed phases in LCO-550 composite are further confirmed by the HRTEM images with fast Fourier transformed (FFT) patterns. Around the interface between layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 phase, respective characteristic lattice spacing of 2.46 Å for the (311) plane of Co3O4 phase and 2.05 Å for the (104) plane of LiCoO2 phase can be observed (Fig. S1a). Also, the pure LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 phase are both identified in LCO-550 composite by FFT analysis (Fig. S1b and c), verifying the phase segregation in LCO-550 composite. Due to the higher calcination temperatures from LCO-350 spinel to LCO-550 composite and further to LCO-1000 composite, material particle gradually agglomerates to larger size (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 1(e–g) and Fig. S3, the elements in LCO-550 composite are homogeneously dispersed, implying the fine distribution of the two phases in composites. Besides, according to the elemental mapping of LCO-350 spinel and LCO-1000 composite, their elemental distributions are also homogeneous (Fig. S4), revealing the fine elemental distribution via the liquid-phase synthesis method [22,23,33]. Through this facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy, we can well control the phase content in this system. Next, we attempt to understand the underlying mechanism of this phase-segregation phenomenon. We conducted XRD spectra, Raman spectra, and formation energy (E form) calculations for our purpose. As presented in Fig. 2 (a), the biggest difference between LCO-350 spinel and layered LiCoO2 in XRD spectra lies at 2θ = ∼65.8°, where LCO-350 spinel shows a single peak while layered LiCoO2 possesses a totally split double peak as widely reported [32,34,35]. We observed that layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase (main characteristic XRD peak at ∼36.7°, not overlapped with any XRD peak of Li2Co2O4 spinel and layered LiCoO2 structure in line with literature) [32] were formed when calcinating in air from 400 to 1000 °C, where 475 °C is the critical point (Fig. 2a). Moreover, according to the enlarged XRD patterns, totally split double peaks at ∼65.8° are observed for LCO-550 and LCO-1000 composites as compared with other composites calcinated under other temperatures (Fig. S5), demonstrating the complete transformation from Li2Co2O4 spinel phase to layered LiCoO2 phase over 550 °C besides Co3O4 phase. From Raman plots in Fig. 2(b), we also found that the characteristic broad signals of LCO-350 spinel at ∼443.6, ∼477.2, ∼582.9, and ∼602.6 cm−1 gradually turn into the characteristic sharp peaks of layered LiCoO2 phase at ∼487.0 and ∼596.0 cm−1 [36]. The main characteristic Raman signal of Co3O4 at ∼680 cm−1 can also be observed for samples calcinated under 475–1000 °C (Fig. 2b), which accords well with the XRD results. As illustrated in Fig. 2(c), we revealed the underlying mechanism of this phase-segregation phenomenon. Li and O elements tend to volatilize from the lattice of LCO-350 spinel (E form = −0.9490 eV) under higher calcination temperatures [37,38], which induces the formation of layered LiCoO2 phase with relative lower formation energy (E form = −0.9502 eV), accompanied with the generation of Co3O4 spinel phase in line with the reported findings [39]. This phase-segregation process can be briefly described as: Li2Co2O4 − xLi+ − yO2− → LiCoO2 + nCo3O4. The evidence of easier Li volatilization under higher temperature can be further supported by our ICP-MS results, where LCO-1000 composite possesses lower Li content than LCO-550 composite (Fig. S6). The easier O volatilization under higher temperature will be verified by our analysis of hard XAS spectra below. 3.2 OER performance Then, we measured the OER activity and stability of representative samples, namely LCO-350 spinel, LCO-550, and LCO-1000 composites. Traditional OER measurements were conducted on GCE in 0.1 M KOH under room temperature [14,22]. As revealed in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. S7, LCO-550 composite exhibits a better OER activity than LCO-350 spinel, LCO-1000 composite, and pure Co3O4 spinel, which means the moderate proportion between layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase in composite contributes to the optimum OER activity. Besides, the Tafel slope of LCO-550 composite (105 mV dec−1) is smaller than that of LCO-350 spinel (112 mV dec−1) and LCO-1000 composite (116 mV dec−1) as shown in Fig. S8, revealing the fast OER kinetics of LCO-550 composite [40–42]. It is worth noting that the OER performance of LCO-550 composite is comparable to that of most reported pure Co-based oxides (Table S2). To further compare with the mostly reported Co/Fe-based oxides, we also measured the OER performance of Fe-doped LCO-550 composite (namely LiCo0.8Fe0.2O2), where its overpotential at 10 mA cm− 2 disk (305 mV) in 0.1 M KOH is still smaller than that of the Co/Fe-based oxides reported in many literatures (Fig. S9 and Table S2). In terms of the OER stability, the overpotentials of three samples are all reduced at the beginning of chronopotentiometric curves (Fig. 3b), which may be ascribed to the beneficial Li+ leaching effects to trigger OH− adsorption [34]. The initial Li+ leaching effects lead to the close potential of LCO-550 and LCO-1000 composites at the beginning of the OER stability [34]. Then, the potential of LCO-350 spinel continues to drop, implying that the Li+ leaching effects still dominate its OER stability in line with literature [34]. The OER stability of LCO-550 composite becomes steady, while that of LCO-1000 composite turns worse. To accelerate the Li+ leaching effects and investigate the OER stability at a high current density, we measured the OER stability of our samples at 100 mA cm− 2 disk for 40 h in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. S10). It can be found that LCO-550 composite still shows the best OER stability, while the OER stability of LCO-1000 composite quickly becomes worse within only ∼10 h. After Li+ leaching, the OER stability of LCO-350 spinel also turns stable. The origins of the OER activity and stability for our samples will be further illustrated below. 3.3 Structural reconstruction effects Herein, to explain the difference of material OER activity and stability, we compared the structural reconstruction effects of three samples via hard XAS spectra (including Co-K X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and Co-K extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)). It has been well acknowledged that Co-K XANES and EXAFS spectra are sensitive to material Co valence state and Co local structure, respectively [14,22,28]. In terms of Co-K XANES spectrum, it has been reported that a higher energy position at normalized absorption of 0.7–0.8 means a higher Co valence state in measured samples [12,22,28]. By comparing the detailed photon energies at normalized absorption of 0.7–0.8 of Co-K XANES spectra for samples and references, we can determine the detailed Co valence in our samples [22,43,44]. As displayed in Fig. 4 (a), the spectral energy position at normalized absorption of 0.7–0.8 shifts to higher energies from LCO-1000 composite to LCO-550 composite and further to LCO-350 spinel, revealing the Co valence order of LCO-350 (3.0+ ) > LCO-550 (2.9+ ) > LCO-1000 (2.7+ ). This result also verifies that with increasing calcination temperatures, the lattice oxygen is volatilized from the structure of LCO-350 spinel due to the thermal reduction (Fig. 2c), leading to a lower Co valence state in composites. After OER, the Co-K XANES spectra of three samples all shift to higher energy positions as compared with those before OER, demonstrating the increased Co valence of three samples after OER. It can also be observed that the increased Co valence of LCO-1000 composite is the largest while that of LCO-350 spinel is the smallest. This can be ascribed to the lowest Co valence in LCO-1000 composite, where the lower Co valence tends to suffer from OER oxidation currents as reported previously [8,45,46]. The low-valence Co species come from the Co3O4 phase in our system, which means LCO-1000 composite with the most content of Co3O4 phase may suffer the largest structural reconstruction (as demonstrated below). To compare the variations of material local structures before and after OER, we further analyzed the Co-K EXAFS spectra. As exhibited in Fig. 4(b), the peak signals at ∼1.52 and ∼2.46 Å are identified as the Co–O and edge-sharing Co–Co shells, respectively [14,28,47]. For the Co–O shell, the shell intensity of LCO-350 spinel is higher than that of LCO-550 composite, while that of LCO-1000 composite is the lowest. This implies that the Co–O coordination number of LCO-350 spinel is the largest, while that of LCO-1000 composite is the smallest, further supporting the easier lattice-oxygen volatilization from oxides under higher temperatures in line with literatures [38,48]. The higher Co–O coordination number indicates the more lattice O sites and higher Co valence state due to the requirement of charge balance [12,22], which accords well with the results of Co-K XANES. After OER, the enhanced intensity of Co–O shell can be ascribed to the increased Co valence (namely increased lattice O sites) and the adsorption of foreign OH− reactants [14,45]. We can find that the magnitude of enhanced Co–O shell follows the order of LCO-1000 ≈ LCO-550 > LCO-350. To identify the specific origins of the Co–O enhancement for LCO-1000 and LCO-550 composites, we further performed the FTIR measurements. The FTIR spectra of samples after OER show that the intensity of characteristic OH− signal at ∼3441.6 cm−1 [2,12] for LCO-550 composite is relatively larger than that for LCO-1000 composite, and that for LCO-350 spinel is the lowest (Fig. 4c). This finding proves that the adsorption of foreign OH− reactants dominates the enhancement of Co–O shell for LCO-550 composite, while that for LCO-1000 composite is largely affected by its increased Co valence. To directly compare material structural reconstruction, we further analyzed the information of edge-sharing Co–Co shell in the Co-K EXAFS spectra. It has been well acknowledged that the enhancement of edge-sharing Co–Co shell during/after OER is identified as the formation of amorphous edge-sharing hydroxides [45,47]. After OER, the magnitude of the enhancement of edge-sharing Co–Co shell for LCO-1000 composite is the largest, followed by LCO-550 composite, and that for LCO-350 spinel is the smallest (Fig. 4b). This demonstrates that LCO-1000 composite with the lowest Co valence suffers from the largest structural reconstruction to form edge-sharing hydroxides, while the structural reconstruction on LCO-350 spinel with the highest Co valence is the smallest. Under the severe structural reconstruction, large numbers of amorphous edge-sharing hydroxides will be formed on LCO-1000 composite and then continuously collapse into the electrolyte, sacrificing its OER stability and activity. LCO-550 composite with suitable Co valence exhibits the moderate structural reconstruction benefitting from the optimal reconstruction effects, which can explain its best OER activity and stability in this system. LCO-350 spinel with the smallest structural reconstruction can also maintain its OER stability but gain limited reconstruction merits to achieve a better activity. Above results also prove that with increasing calcination temperatures, material Co valence becomes lower and structural reconstruction turns more severe in line with literatures [8,45,46], thus realizing facile control of material structural reconstruction effects by our thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy. In Fig. 4(d), we clearly show the relationship between material structural reconstruction effects and their OER performance of three samples. However, the detailed roles of the layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase in the best sample LCO-550 composite are still unclear, which will be further investigated below. 3.4 Operando strain effects To figure out the specific roles of the layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase in LCO-550 composite, we combined operando Raman spectra and ex-situ HRTEM images. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), operando Raman peaks of LCO-550 composite shift to lower positions with increasing OER potentials, showing the enhanced tensile strain on LCO-550 composite during OER [11,12]. Compared with the HRTEM image of LCO-550 composite before OER, the (003) plane of the layered LiCoO2 phase in LCO-550 composite after OER is stretched by ∼3.2% (Fig. 5b and c) [49,50], further corroborating the existence of the tensile strain on LCO-550 composite during/after OER. It is worth mentioning that strained layered LiCoO2 phase still maintains crystalline structure after OER in line with prior findings [10,51]. The appearance of amorphous structure on LCO-550 composite after OER (Fig. 5c) can be attributed to the structural reconstruction of low-valence Co3O4 spinel phase into amorphous high-valence CoOOH x , which can also be supported by many previous observations [52–54]. These can be further verified by the XRD pattern after OER. Compared with the XRD pattern of pristine LCO-550 composite, the (003) peak signal of layered LiCoO2 phase shifts to a much lower degree after OER (Fig. S11), demonstrating obvious expansion along (003) plane, namely the tensile strain [11,12]. Besides, the crystalline structural signals of layered LiCoO2 phase still remain, which accords well with the reported findings on such layered structures [10,51]. For Co3O4 phase, its characteristic peak at ∼36.7° disappears after OER (Fig. S11), supporting its facile amorphization into CoOOH x in line with literatures [52–54]. Therefore, now we can clearly unravel the specific roles of the layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase in LCO-550 composite during/after OER (Fig. 5d). The layered LiCoO2 phase is stretched along the (003) plane accompanied with Li+ leaching to form strained layered Li x CoO2 active phase, triggering beneficial operando strain effects to induce more OH− adsorption. As for Co3O4 spinel phase (E form = −0.1571 eV), it suffers from OER oxidation functions to transform into high-valence CoOOH x active phase with relatively lower formation energy of −0.4893 eV, exerting the reconstruction effects to trigger OH− adsorption. The unique synergistic operando strain and reconstruction effects endow LCO-550 composite with the best OH− adsorption capability and the optimal OER performance in this system. 3.5 Mechanism investigations To further study the OH− adsorption on pristine phases and reconstructed phases in LCO-550 composite, we conducted DFT calculations. As illustrated in Fig. 6 (a and b), the adsorption of OH− reactants plays a vital role in two major OER mechanisms, namely the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM, steps 1 and 3) and the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM, steps 1 and 4) [1,55,56]. Thus, the beneficial OH− adsorption can help accelerate the OER processes and further improve the OER performance. We calculated the OH− adsorption energies (E OH−) on pristine layered LiCoO2, stretched Li x CoO2, pristine Co3O4 spinel, and reconstructed CoOOH x phase (Fig. 6c–f). Compared to pristine layered LiCoO2 phase (E OH− = −3.5008 eV), the OH− adsorption on stretched Li x CoO2 active phase with a lower EOH− of −5.8497 eV is easier (Fig. 6c and d). Also, the reconstructed CoOOH x active phase exhibits a lower E OH− (E OH− = −2.4970 eV) than pristine Co3O4 spinel (E OH− = −2.3121 eV) as displayed in Fig. 6(e and f), demonstrating the more beneficial OH− adsorption on reconstructed CoOOH x active phase. The generated active phases on LCO-550 composite during/after OER exert synergistic operando strain and reconstruction effects to endow it with the optimal OH− adsorption capability and the enhanced OER performance. To further analyze the detailed roles of the strain effects on layered Li x CoO2 active phase and the reconstruction effects on CoOOH x active phase in the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, we conducted more OER mechanism investigations by combining experiments and calculations. Firstly, we need to experimentally identify the possible OER mechanism on our sample. It has been widely acknowledged that the LOM mechanism can be reflected by material pH-dependent OER activity, where the OER activity of catalysts following the LOM mechanism is greatly improved with the increasing pH values of the solutions [19,22,28,56]. As shown in Fig. 6(g), the OER activity of LCO-550 composite is obviously enhanced in 1.0 M KOH as compared with that in 0.1 M KOH, implying its favorable LOM mechanism. Moreover, we also confirmed material LOM mechanism by measuring the OER activity in 1.0 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide solutions (TMAOH), where the TMA+ cations tend to interact with material negative lattice oxygen (OL) sites due to the charge requirement [57]. Compared with the OER activity in 1.0 M KOH, the performance of LCO-550 composite in 1.0 M TMAOH significantly declines, verifying the important role of lattice-oxygen participation on LCO-550 composite for OER [57]. Then, we calculated the detailed LOM pathways on the layered Li x CoO2 active phase with strain effects and the CoOOH x active phase with reconstruction effects. As revealed in Fig. 6(h), the LOM pathway of CoOOH x is hindered by the first step, namely the deprotonation from material OLH sites with a high energy barrier of 0.6953 eV. For stretched Li x CoO2, its first step of deprotonation from OH− species adsorbed on one Co site is thermodynamically spontaneous (−0.7808 eV), endowing its relatively easier LOM pathway until the fourth step. In the fourth step, deprotonation from the OLH sites between two Co sites on stretched Li x CoO2 is rather difficult (energy barrier of 2.1476 eV), harder than the first deprotonation step of CoOOH x . At this time, the LOM routine of CoOOH x is more favorable. Overall, the energy barrier of the rate-determining step on CoOOH x (0.6953 eV) is lower than that on stretched Li x CoO2 (2.1476 eV), which means material lattice-oxygen participation is more severe on CoOOH x with reconstruction effect and stretched Li x CoO2 is relatively more stable. Material lattice-oxygen participation (namely LOM pathway) for OER is a double-edged sword, where moderate lattice-oxygen participation is beneficial for the improvement of OER activity while excessive lattice-oxygen participation leads to the collapse and loss of active phases and further degrades OER stability and activity [58]. Therefore, a balance between the strain effects on stable Li x CoO2 active phase and the reconstruction effects on CoOOH x active phase is critical, where the best LCO-550 composite exerts the optimal synergistic strain and reconstruction effects. In our system, LCO-1000 composite with the most content of Co3O4 phase suffers from excessive structural reconstruction and material lattice-oxygen participation (trigged by CoOOH x transformed from initial Co3O4), resulting in its worst OER activity and stability (Fig. 3a and b and Fig. S10). With the moderate proportions of Co3O4 phase and LiCoO2 phase, LCO-550 composite not only benefits from the merits of moderate structural reconstruction and material lattice-oxygen participation to improve the OER activity, but also gains from the relatively stable stretched Li x CoO2 active phase to maintain its optimal OER activity and stability (Figs. 3a, b and 5a, b, Figs. S10 and S11). With the smallest structural reconstruction (Fig. 4b), LCO-350 spinel can also maintain its OER stability (Fig. S10) but gain limited reconstruction advantages, resulting in a moderate OER activity in this system (Fig. 3a). 4 Conclusions In summary, for the first time, we report a facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to simultaneously master material operando strain and reconstruction effects. Various structural characterizations successfully reveal the possible phase-segregation processes from LCO-350 spinel to LCO-550 and LCO-1000 composites. The layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel phase in LCO-550 composite with the best OER performance in this system exert beneficial operando tensile-strain and reconstruction effects, respectively. These unique operando synergistic effects endow LCO-550 composite with the optimum OH− adsorption capability and OER performance. Besides, we also build the relationship between material structural reconstruction effects and their OER performance for this system. It is worth noting that this thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy is also applicable for many other important oxide systems considering the facile volatilization of alkaline-earth/rare-earth and O elements under high temperatures [37–39,48], including simple oxides [38,48], layered oxides [39], perovskite oxides [59], and spinel oxides [38], which are very important functional materials for electrolysis, batteries, fuel cells, thermochemical water-splitting cycle, environmentology, and physics. We believe this work will motivate the energy and environmental communities to focus more on mastering material dynamic structural-evolution effects by facile and effective phase-segregation strategy.

        "dc:description": "Material strain and reconstruction effects are critical for catalysis reactions, but current insights into operando strain effects during reaction and means to master catalyst reconstruction are still lacking. Here, we propose a facile thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to simultaneously master material operando strain and reconstruction effects for enhanced oxygen-evolving reaction (OER). Specifically, self-assembled and controllable layered LiCoO2 phase and Co3O4 spinel can be generated from pristine Li2Co2O4 spinel via Li and O volatilization under different temperatures, realizing controllable proportions of two phases by calcination temperature. Combined operando and ex-situ characterizations reveal that obvious tensile strain along (003) plane appears on layered Li x CoO2 phase during OER, while low-valence Co3O4 phase transforms into high-valence CoOOH x , realizing simultaneous operando strain and reconstruction effects. Further experimental and computational investigations demonstrate that both strained Li x CoO2 phase and reconstructed CoOOH x compound contribute to the beneficial adsorption of important OH− reactants, while respective roles in activity and stability are uncovered by exploring their lattice-oxygen participation mechanism. This work not only reveals material operando strain effects during OER, but also inaugurates a new thermal-induced phase-segregation strategy to artificially master material operando strain and reconstruction effects, which will enlighten rational material design for many potential reactions and applications.",
