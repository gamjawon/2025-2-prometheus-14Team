Interfacultaw Reactor lnstltuut, Delft Unwerstty of Technology, Mekelweg 15, 2629 JB Delft, The Netherlands Received 30 May 1996; accepted 30 May 1996 Abstract The interaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with an alumina-supported iron catalyst has been studied at temperatures ranging from 300 to 523 K and at a pressure of 103 kPa. The species produced and adsorbed on the catalyst surface have been examined by infrared spectroscopy, while the chemical state of the iron within the catalyst was investigated by magnetization measurements and M~Sssbauer spectroscopy. At 300 K the main type of adsorbed species on the iron particle surface appeared to be molecular carbon monoxide and formate groups. The amount of the latter species increases considerably at elevated reaction temperatures up to 473 K. Changes in the infrared absorption bands of CO, and in the magnetization and MiSssbauer data indicate that under the applied conditions the surface properties of the iron particles are affected by the synthesis gas, but that the bulk remains metallic. The increased Fischer-Tropsch activity at more elevated temperatures, viz. 473 and 523 K, is accompanied by significant changes in the in situ recorded infrared spectra. The formation of hydrocarbons is evident from the well developed absorption bands in the 3000-2800 cm- 1 range, due to (a)symmetric stretching vibrations of CH and CH3 groups. Assignment of the various absorption bands in the 1700-1200 cm-l wavenum- ber range is speculative due to (partial) coincidence of the bands and the gradual change in chemical composition of the catalyst particles. At higher temperatures the bulk of the iron particles reacts rapidly to a mixture of carbides. Initially the unstable e-Fe2C is formed which reacts to e'-Fe2.2C upon prolonged periods of time of reaction and/or increased reaction temperatures. These carbides appeared to be thermally unstable: upon heating in helium they are converted into a mixture of x-FesC2 and metallic Fe. Interaction of the reduced iron catalysts with ethylene or methane at 523 K gives rise to absorption bands at 1555, 1345 and 1050 cm-~, which are * Corresponding author. t Previously submitted on 30 November 1994 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Among the large number of studies devoted to the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide on iron catalysts, only a few deal with infrared spectroscopic investigation of surface species [1-5]. Analogous studies have been performed with ruthenium [6-10], nickel [ 11 ], and rhodium catalysts [ 12,13]. Compounds, such as hydrocarbons, formates and carboxylates are reported to be present at the catalyst surface, but not all species mentioned are considered to be reaction intermediates. In general, interpretation of the obtained spectroscopic results is greatly hampered by the complex nature of the catalyst system. Firstly, since adsorption induces changes in the vibration modes and vibration energies of a compound, data obtained from spectra of pure gaseous or liquid compounds cannot simply be applied to identify adsorbed species. In particular group vibrations of small organic molecules can be expected to change upon chemisorption. With supported catalysts, surface species can be located on both the metal particles and the support and thus exhibit different vibration character- istics. Secondly, during the catalytic reaction the chemical composition of the catalyst (surface) can be modified and can thus cause a shift of absorption bands. Finally, interpretation of the spectroscopic data can be crossed by the intrinsic catalytic activity of the support. Therefore, adsorption of reference compounds and performing appropriate reactions on pure support materials, metal films, and single crystals can be of great assistance in the interpretation of the results. It has been demonstrated that a Fe/A1203 catalyst prepared by deposition- precipitation of an iron cyanide complex exhibits interesting properties with respect to its interaction with hydrogen and carbon monoxide [14]. Admission of 1.33 kPa CO at 300 K to the reduced catalyst was observed to lead to a number of differently adsorbed CO species, and the formation of formate, carbonate, and hydrocarbon species at the catalyst surface. It is expected that under well established Fischer-Tropsch synthesis conditions the production of (oxygenated) hydrocarbons by the above catalyst will be enhanced. Therefore, the present study focuses on the interaction of the reduced iron catalyst with synthesis gas at 103 kPa and at temperatures ranging from 300 to 548 K. The surface species and bulk composition of the catalyst are in situ characterised by infrared spectroscopy, and magnetization measurements and Mtissbauer spectroscopy, respectively. This systematic approach facilitates a detailed observation of the surface species and the chemical composition of the catalyst in different stages of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction. E. Boellaard et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 231 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization The iron catalyst, which has a metal loading of 20 wt.-%, was prepared by means of homogeneous deposition-precipitation of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) with ferrous chloride onto a y-alumina support. Before being used as a catalyst, the cyanide precursor was converted to an oxidic precursor by an oxidation treatment and subsequently reduced. The general features of the preparation method have been described more extensively in [15], while details on the preparation, oxidation and reduction of the Fe/A1203 catalyst are reported in [14]. To elucidate the chemical composition of the bulk phases of the catalyst, before, during, as well as after the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction, samples were in situ characterized by means of magnetic methods and MiSssbauer spectroscopy, while infrared spectroscopic investigations were performed to get information about the surface of the catalyst particles and the adsorbed species after the reaction. 2.2. Magnetic measurements Fischer-Tropsch synthesis experiments were performed with an in situ reduced oxidic sample of 200 mg. The reduction process comprised isothermal reaction periods of 58 ks at successively 473, 548, 623, and 723 K [14]. The reduced catalyst was heated with 250 mK/s from room temperature to the desired synthesis temperature in a flow of 1.00 ml/s synthesis gas of a H 2-to-CO ratio of 2.0. During the isothermal stage of the process, the magneti- zation was measured at 0.39 MA m-~ every 0.18 ks using a modified Weiss-ex- traction method [14]. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction was performed for 3.6 ks at 300, 373, 423, 473 and 523 K. After the final synthesis sequence, the catalyst was cooled down to room temperature, and the synthesis gas was replaced by helium. After flushing for 1.80 ks the magnetization was measured as a function of the magnetic field strength at 300 K. Additionally, the temperature depen- dency of the magnetization was measured at a fixed magnetic field strength of 0.39 MA m-1 to perform a thermomagnetic analysis (TMA). After a second magnetization-versus-magnetic field strength measurement at 300 K the helium was replaced by an argon-10 vol.-% hydrogen mixture and a second TMA was measured. The series was concluded with a magnetization-versus-magnetic field strength measurement at 300 K. Before being used, the helium (HoekLoos, 99.9990%) and argon-10 vol.-% hydrogen gas mixtures (HoekLoos, 99.9990%) were purified over a Oxisorb Gas Purifier (Messer Griessheim GmbH), while the hydrogen-33 vol.-% carbon monoxide gas mixture (HoekLoos, 99.9990 resp. 99.997%) was used without 232 E. Boellaard et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 further purification. To prevent formation of volatile iron or nickel carbonyl, the carbon monoxide was contacted with aluminium, brass and copper metals only. For that reason a new type pressure regulator was developed in collaboration with HoekLoos, which is suitable for manipulating high-purity carbon monox- ide(-containing gas mixtures). The semi two-stage pressure regulator is now also commercially available [16]. 2.3. MiSssbauer spectroscopy Mtissbauer measurements were performed in situ, using the previously de- scribed equipment and procedures [14]. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis experiments were performed with an oxidic precursor of 200 mg, which was previously reduced following the above mentioned procedure. The reduced catalyst was subsequently heated within 1.8 ks to the desired reaction temperature in a flow of 1.00 ml/s synthesis gas of a H2-to-CO ratio of 2.0. The CO-hydrogenation reaction was performed for periods of time of 3.6 or 10.8 ks at successively 300, 373, 423, 473, 523, and 548 K. After each isothermal stage the catalyst was cooled down to 300 K and a M~Sssbauer spectrum was recorded. Argon, hydrogen and carbon monoxide were supplied by HoekLoos and purified over BASF Catalysts R 3-11 and molecular sieve Linde 4A. 2.4. Infrared spectroscopy The ground cyanide precursor was pressed at 32 MPa to a self-supporting wafer (0 15 mm, 55 mg) and placed in a quartz cell in which in situ treatment of the wafer could be performed [14]. For thermal treatment the wafer was placed in the furnace section of the cell. After an oxidation and subsequent reduction treatment [14] infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed according to the following procedure: after cooling down to room temperature, the argon-10 vol.-% hydrogen flow was stopped and the gas phase was removed by evacuating the system for 1.8 ks down to a pressure of 0.13 mPa. Subsequently, the first (reference) spectrum was recorded. For studying the effect of carbide formation on the carbon monoxide chemisorption properties of the iron catalyst, and in order to obtain information on surface species formed during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the sample was exposed to 101.3 kPa high-purity hydrogen-33 vol.-% carbon monoxide (HoekLoos, 99.9990 resp. 99.997%), and if required kept at a high temperature in a flow of the above gas mixture, for 0.3 ks. After replacing the sample in the infrared beam, a spectrum was recorded at room temperature. The synthesis was continued for additional periods of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.8 ks. This synthesis sequence was subsequently performed at 300 (without sample displacement), 373, 423, 473, and 523 K. Desorption of surface species was studied by recording spectra after evacuation of the cell. Infrared absorption spectra of species bonded to the E. Boellaard et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 233 catalyst surface were obtained by computer substraction of the reference spec- trum from the transmission spectrum of interest. To facilitate peak identification, a reference Fischer-Tropsch synthesis exper- iment was performed with a wafer of only the A1203 support. In addition, the reaction of methane and ethylene with the reduced iron catalyst had been studied at 523 K. Due to interference of strong gas phase absorptions, the spectra were recorded after evacuation of the system and, consequently, the spectra provide only information on the irreversibly adsorbed species. 3. Results The reduction process of the oxidic precursor appeared to be reproducible. The magnetization-versus-time curves measured in this study did not deviate significantly from the results of a previous study. After the last reduction step at 723 K, the sample was exposed to synthesis gas at successively increasing temperatures. The observed changes in the magnetization of the catalyst sample during these Fischer-Tropsch syntheses are illustrated in Fig. 1. Admission of the hydrogen-carbon monoxide gas flow to the reduced catalyst at 300 K resulted instantly in a small, but significant drop of the magnetization. At 374 and 425 K a small decrease of the magnetization with time was observed. At 472 and 523 K this decrease was much more pronounced. After 3.6 ks of reaction time at 523 K, the magnetization still declined. 11000 I00~ -4 9OO0 6 7 < 8000 N Z 7000 6000 5000 3OO K ................... 373K \"1,,,oo,,, 423 K 473 K '''',, 523K I I I i 1 2 3 4 TIME / ks Fig. 1.

Thermomagnetic analysis of a Fe2Fe catalyst after FTS at 523 K. Measurements performed in helium and subsequently in hydrogen. In order to identify the ultimately formed phase(s) and to determine the thermal stability and reactivity, the TMA measurements, presented in Fig. 2, were subsequently performed. At the left-hand side the measurement in helium, and at the right-hand side that in hydrogen is shown. Upon heating in helium, the magnetization curve of the spent catalyst exhibited a complicated behaviour. The large decrease of the magnetization in the temperature range of 300 to 665 K evidences a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic transition. The corresponding transition temperature, the Curie temperature (To), is about 645 K. Further heating resulted in two successive sequences of increasing and decreasing magnetization. The increase of the magnetization at increasing temperature indicates that a compound of a low magnetic moment/Curie temperature is being converted to one of a higher magnetic moment/Curie temperature. The decrease in magnetization in the temperature range of 700-775 K points again to a magnetic transition. The transition temperature, however, cannot be estimated accurately, since the observed course of the decline in magnetization was most likely influenced by a non-steady-state process, which caused an increase of the magnetization. Above 775 K the rise in magnetization became dominant. Information about the magnetic phases formed during heating can be derived from the cooling branch of the TMA-helium curve. Firstly, the clear hysteresis between the heating and cooling branch of the magnetization curve underlines the occurrence of thermally induced phase conversions. In the cooling branch two magnetic transitions are encountered. The corresponding Curie temperature of about 530 K can easily be derived from the measured E.

During heating in hydrogen after the TMA-He experiment, the heating branch of the TMA-H2 curve and the cooling branch of the TMA-He curve coincided precisely up to 650 K, but at higher temperatures the magnetization declined at a lower rate in a flow of hydrogen. As a result the two branches of the TMA-H2 curve exhibited hysteresis upon cooling down to room temperature. The phase with the transition temperature of 530 K is still present, although to a slightly smaller extent. The overall magnetization at 300 K has increased by the treatment in hydrogen. M~issbauer spectra of the reduced and in situ treated catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. The results of the computer analyses are given in Table 1. The first change in the bulk composition of the catalyst due to interaction with synthesis gas was observed after 3.6 ks exposure at 473 K. At higher temperatures the spectral contribution of the metallic iron sextuplet decreased in favour of a set of new sextuplets and doublets. Retrieval of the various components in the obtained spectra is guided by the rather well developed sextuplets. Due to the dynamic character of the catalyst during the initial stage of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, the phases are poorly defined and, consequently, the line widths are 236 E.

The fit of the central part of the spectra by means of doublets, however, is less reliable due to coincidence of the contributions of several of the phases present. The relative contributions of the spectral components changed with the reaction temperature and the time, as shown in Table 1. The sextuplet with HF = 242 kOe and the doublet with IS = 0.96 and QS = 0.70 mm/s completely disappeared and only a sextuplet with HF = 170 kOe and two doublets with low intensities remained after synthesis gas reaction at 548 K. The analogous experimental set-up employed for infrared spectroscopic inves- tigation of the surface species produced during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, resulted in the spectra shown in Figs. 4-6. Exposure of the in situ reduced iron catalyst to synthesis gas at room temperature gave rise to a series absorption bands at 2769, 2679, 2033, 1987, 1915, 1799, 1751, 1650, 1600, 1564, 1350, 1325 and 1048 cm-~. The resolution in the 2050-2250 cm-~ spectral range suffered from a system artefact: due to the relatively high gas pressure, the difference in optical path length between sample and reference beam resulted in a negative absorption band of gas phase carbon monoxide. The effect was even more pronounced when the furnace compartment, which was located just above the optical path, was at high temperature. Upon synthesis at 373 K, the intensity of all bands continuously rose, although the bands peaking at 1799 and 1751 cm- ~ tended to saturate. No new bands were observed. At 423 K the changes in the 2100-1700 cm- 1 range are marginal, except for a significant decrease of the 1987 cm- ~ band. Synthesis at 473 K, Fig. 5, caused pronounced changes of the 238 E.

Since the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis experiments performed gave rise to a number of adsorbed intermediate and product species, and because the reaction was accompanied with a change of the catalyst composition, assignment of the observed infrared absorption bands to specific adsorbate species and adsorption sites, requires accurate reference data. Therefore some reference systems have been studied in an attempt to distinguish the various C-O, C-H and C-C vibrations. The relevant spectra are reproduced in Fig. 7. Exposure of a reduced iron catalyst to a flow of ethylene at 523 K resulted in the formation of irreversibly adsorbed species, which gave rise to absorption bands at 2160, 1555, 1345, and 1050 cm-~. The intensity of these bands increased with a prolonged reaction period of time. Upon subsequent reaction with hydrogen the 2158 cm-1 band immediately disappeared, whereas the intensity of the other bands gradually declined. The same bands, except for that at 2160 cm-~, were found upon exposure of a reduced catalyst to methane at 523 K. After 10.8 ks of reaction with methane at 523 K, the catalyst is still capable of adsorption of carbon monoxide: admission of 13.3 kPa CO for 3.6 ks 240 E.

Infrared spectrum of a y-alumina support after FTS at 523 K for 3.6 ks. resulted in the formation of two additional bands at 1985 and 1890 cm-1, respectively. The bands at 1555 and 1345 cm-1 increased in intensity, while also a new band became visible at 1595 cm-1. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction was also performed over a bare y-alumina support, which had previously been reduced at 723 K. After reaction at temperatures increasing from 423 K, absorption bands at 3007, 2912, 1598, 1395, and 1383 cm-1 were exhibited. The intensity of the bands gradually increased with reaction period of time and temperature. The spectrum of Fig. 8 was recorded after 3.6 ks reaction at 523 K. The presented spectrum resembled the spectrum that was obtained after adsorption of formic acid on an alumina support. 4. Discussion Admission of 133 kPa synthesis gas to the reduced iron catalyst appeared to affect both the surface and bulk properties of the metallic phase, as revealed by magnetic, Mt~ssbauer, and infrared spectroscopic measurements. The extent of interaction strongly depends on the temperature. Switching from argon-hydro- gen to carbon monoxide-hydrogen gas at 300 K is accompanied by an instanta- neous drop of the magnetization by only 0.8%, as shown in Fig. 1. This effect is attributed to the interaction of CO with the surface atoms of the metal particles. E. Boellaard et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 241 As observed by infrared spectroscopy, admission of CO leads to the presence of a number of adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. Dissociation of carbon monoxide and penetration of the resulting carbon and oxygen atoms into the metal surface are likely to destroy the ferromagnetic coupling of the surface atoms to the other metal atoms of the metal particles. The rate at which the magnetization falls at temperatures up to 423 K is low as compared to the rate at 473 and 523 K. This suggests that the penetration of carbon and oxygen atoms into the lattice of the iron particles at this temperature is restricted to the outermost surface layers. Conversion of the bulk of the particles proceeds only at temperatures equal or higher than 473 K. The observed changes of the magnetization indicate the formation of bulk compounds which have a much lower magnetic moment than metallic iron. In this system where iron is reacting with CO the formation of at least six ferromagnetic carbides has to be consid- ered: 0-Fe3C (Tc = 485 _ 8 K), x-FesC2 (To = 530 _ 10 K), Fe7C3 (T~ = 523 + 3 K), e'-F%.2C (T~=653_10 K), e-Fe2C (T~ = 723 ___10 K) and Fe~C. Furthermore, Fe304 and metallic Fe with a Curie temperature of 853 + 15 and 1043 K, respectively, may play a role. Identification of the iron compounds formed during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is facilitated by the observed magnetic transition temperatures in the TMA-He experiment. The magnetic transition at 645 K in the TMA-He experiment points to the presence of a large amount of e'-Fe2.2C in the used catalyst. The magnetization drop in the temperature range 700-775 K indicates that the catalyst also contains some e-Fe2C. From the cooling branch of the TMA-He curve it became apparent that the initially present phases have been thermally decomposed into a mixture of metallic Fe and x-FesC2 and/or Fe7C3 carbide. The latter carbides could not be distinguished by their Curie temperatures. The increase of the magnetization in the temperature range 650-700 K has to be attributed to the formation of a compound of a Curie temperature exceeding 650 K. Considering the history of the catalyst, the presence of Fe304, e-Fe2C and metallic Fe are only possible. Since the cooling branch of the TMA-He curve excluded the presence of Fe304 due to the extrapolated Curie temperature above 850 K, the involvement of this stable oxide is not likely. Therefore e-Fe2C and metallic Fe remained. The latter phase was surely formed in the temperature range of 760-875 K within the heating branch of the TMA-He curve. The increase of the magnetization upon heating the catalyst in hydrogen at temperatures up to 850 K indicated an increase of the fraction metallic iron in the sample. Metallic iron may be formed by hydrogenation of carbon out of the moderately stable x-FesC2 carbide. The fact that exposure of the catalyst to synthesis gas at temperatures up to 423 K causes no significant changes in the recorded M~Sssbauer spectra supports the above interpretation of the magnetic data that the effects on the iron atoms are restricted to the surface atoms of the supported iron particles. Changes in the bulk composition became firstly evident after reaction at 473 K. At this temperature the metallic iron has almost completely reacted. Based on the 242 E. Boellaard et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 different reaction periods of time and the temperature dependence of the spectral components, the newly developed sextuplets and doublets represent at least two different, magnetically ordered iron carbides. The sextuplet with HF = 170 kOe is assigned to the e'-Fe2.2C. In conjunction with the magnetic data, the sextuplet with HF = 242 kOe is assigned to e-FezC carbide. The e-carbide appeared to be unstable under synthesis gas at at temperatures up to 548 K. interrelated: the fact that after 523 K, whereas the e'-carbide is stable, at least The occurrence of these two carbides may be 14.4 ks Fischer-Tropsch reaction at 548 K all e-Fe2C has been converted to e'-Fe2.2C, suggests that the former carbide is a precursor of the latter. Since e-FezC is already present in the early stage of the reaction, the observed increase of the magnetization between 650 and 700 K in the TMA-He experiment has to be ascribed to the decomposition of an iron carbide to metallic Fe and carbon. As is evident from the cooling branch of the TMA-He curve, the x-F%C2 carbide is readily formed by thermal decomposi- tion of the hexagonal carbides e-Fe2C and e'-Fe2.2C. From the MiSssbauer spectra it is obvious that the chemical stability of the iron carbides increases in the order e-Fe2C < e'-Fe2.2C < x-FesC2, whereas the TMA measurements indicate that the thermal stability of these carbides in- creases in the order e'-Fe2.2C < e-FezC < x-FesC2. Note that the formation of the chemically most stable iron carbide is preceded by the unstable carbides. After exposure of the reduced catalyst to synthesis gas at 300 K the surface of the iron particles was covered by a number of different species. The recorded infrared spectra show close resemblance with the spectra recorded after exposure of only 1.33 kPa CO to the reduced iron catalyst. As was discussed before [14], the nature of these species is both linearly (2033 and 1987 cm-1) and bridged (1915, 1799 and 1751 cm-j) bonded carbon monoxide, formate (2769, 2679, 1600 and 1352 cm-~), some carbonate (1650 and 1337 cm-1), and hydrocarbon fragments (2950 and 2160 cm-~). Upon reaction at 373 and 423 K the band assigned to linearly adsorbed CO declines in favour of the band due to bridged-bonded CO species. The changes taking place in the surface of the iron particles under experimental conditions are apparent from the nature of the CO adsorption sites and the effect on the magnetic properties. Interpretation of the other infrared absorption bands is greatly hampered by the irregular trends in the intensity of possibly related bands. The intensity increase of the bands at 2769 and 2679 cm-J is not proportional to that of the 1600-1350 cm-~ bands, suggesting that these sets of bands are not strictly related. Raising the tempera- ture at which the catalyst is exposed to carbon monoxide-hydrogen from room temperature to 373 K increases the number of adsorbed formate species consid- erably. The new band at 1564 cm-1 may be accompanied by the band which coalesces with the 1352 cm-l formate band. Based on the close resemblance with the bands recorded after reaction with methane and ethylene, the bands at 1564 and 1352 cm-~ may be due to bending vibrations of CH fragments adsorbed on the surface of the iron particles. Reaction at more elevated E. Boellaard et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996)229-245 243 temperatures, viz. 473 and especially 523 K, indeed result in the formation of hydrocarbons as proved by the characteristic asymmetric and symmetric CH stretching vibrations of methyl -CH3 (2960 and 2876 cm-~) and methylene -CH2- groups (2925 and 2855 cm-l). The bands at 1576 and 1410 cm-~, which also develop during reaction at 523 K, may be due to CH bending modes of the hydrocarbons. The change of the adsorbent from metallic to carbidic iron may account for the shift in wavenumber. During reaction at 473 K the formate bands at 2771 and 2681 cm-1 rise in intensity, whereas at 523 K they decline. Formation of these small oxygenates is apparently not favourable at 523 K. The previously formed and adsorbed formate species may be desorbed or decom- posed. Reaction of methane and ethylene with the reduced iron catalyst at 523 K resulted in the formation of irreversibly adsorbed species, the infrared spectra of which share bands at 1555, 1345 and 1050 cm-1. Since the reactants only contained C and H atoms, the observed absorption bands have to be assigned to species made up of these atoms. The fragments CH4 and CHzCH2 have in common CHx species. Therefore, it is suggested that the observed absorption bands represent bending modes of CHx species adsorbed on the surface of the iron particles. To exhibit asymmetric and symmetric bending modes at 1555 and 1345 cm-~, the value of x is 2 or 3, respectively. It has been demonstrated for Co, Rh, and Ru surfaces that the average value of x depends on the temperature at which the interaction proceeds [17]. The band at 2160 cm-1, which was observed with ethylene only, may be associated with a species containing a carbon-to-carbon bond. This species appeared to be highly reactive towards hydrogen. Since C2H4 is generally considered to be the primary product in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the nature of the species may be a species, such as CH~=CHy where x and y are 0, 1, or 2. On Rh, the reaction path for carbon-to-carbon bond formation with the lowest activation energy is the recombination of a carbon atom with a mobile -CH2 fragment forming a vinylidene surface species [15]. The surface of the catalyst after reaction with methane is still capable to adsorb CO in the linear and bridged-bonded modes. In contrast to reaction with synthesis gas at the same temperature, the reaction with methane gave much less disturbance of the surface properties of the iron catalyst. Infrared spectra recorded after exposure of a bare alumina support to synthe- sis gas at temperatures up from 423 K exhibit absorption bands which were also found after adsorption of formic acid. The spectrum did not change upon evacuation of the system. Therefore, the bands at 3007, 2912, 1598, and 1393-1383 cm-~ represent different vibration modes of formate species ad- sorbed on A1203. Performing the Fischer-Tropsch reaction over an iron-loaded alumina support gave rise to an analogous set of absorption bands at signifi- cantly different wavenumbers. The energy shift is ascribed to a different interaction between the formate and the metal. Although formate can be also 244 E. Boellaard et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 229-245 formed at active sites on the alumina support at temperatures up from 423 K, all characteristic absorption bands were not observed with the iron catalyst. 5. Conclusions Interaction of an alumina-supported iron catalyst with 103 kPa synthesis gas at temperatures in the range of 300 to 423 K results in the formation of formate species as revealed by infrared spectroscopy. From analogously performed experiments with the pure alumina support, which gives also rise to adsorbed formate species, it was concluded that with the iron catalyst the formate was exclusively formed and adsorbed on the surface of the iron particles. Magnetiza- tion measurements and M~Sssbauer spectroscopy indicate that under these reac- tion conditions the bulk of the catalyst remains metallic, whereas the ferromag- netic coupling of the iron atoms in the surface layer has changed by the adsorbed species. The infrared absorption bands assigned to molecularly ad- sorbed CO indicates changes in adsorption geometry from linearly to bridged- bonded. At a more elevated reaction temperature, 473 K, the bulk of the iron particles rapidly reacts to a mixture of carbides. Initially the unstable e-Fe2C is formed, which is converted at prolonged reaction periods of time and/or increased reaction temperature to e'-Fe2.2C. These carbides appeared to be thermally unstable: upon heating in helium they are converted to a mixture of x-F%C2 and metallic Fe. The increased Fischer-Tropsch activity at elevated temperature is accompanied by significant changes in the in situ recorded infrared spectra. The formation of hydrocarbons is evident from well developed absorption bands in the 3000-2800 cm-1 range, due to (a)symmetric stretching vibrations of CH2 and CH3 groups. Assignment of the various absorption bands in the 1700-1200 cm-J wavenumber range is speculative due to (partial) coincidence of the bands and the gradual change in chemical composition of the catalyst particles. Interaction of the reduced iron catalyst with ethylene or methane at 523 K gives rise to absorption bands at 1555, 1345 and 1050 cm-~, which are assigned to CHx adspecies. Upon reaction with ethylene also a band at 2160 cm-1 was observed, which was assigned to an ethylidyne species. References [1] G. Blyholder and L.D. Neff, J. Phys. Chem., 66 (1962) 1664. [2] V.

The interaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with an alumina-supported iron catalyst has been studied at temperatures ranging from 300 to 523 K and at a pressure of 103 kPa. The species produced and adsorbed on the catalyst surface have been examined by infrared spectroscopy, while the chemical state of the iron within the catalyst was investigated by magnetization measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy. At 300 K the main type of adsorbed species on the iron particle surface appeared to be molecular carbon monoxide and formate groups. The amount of the latter species increases considerably at elevated reaction temperatures up to 473 K. Changes in the infrared absorption bands of CO, and in the magnetization and Mössbauer data indicate that under the applied conditions the surface properties of the iron particles are affected by the synthesis gas, but that the bulk remains metallic.
