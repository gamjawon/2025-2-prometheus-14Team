Use of Citric Acid in Synthesizing a Highly Dispersed Copper Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenolysis Ming-Hoong LOOI*, Shuk-Tong LEE, Sharifah Bee ABD-HAMID Combinatorial Technology and Catalysis Research Centre, Institute of Postgraduate Studies, University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Abstract: A highly dispersed Cu catalyst supported on silica was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method with citric acid. The synthesis was studied by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and temperature programmed reduction by comparing with a ref- erence prepared without citric acid. The catalyst precursor obtained after impregnation was X-ray amorphous. The precursor was readily transformed to crystalline CuO upon calcination. The CuO particles were of uniform size in a highly dispersed state and can be reduced to Cu at a lower temperature. The activity of the Cu catalyst obtained was an order of magnitude higher than that of the reference for the hy- drogenolysis of methyl laurate to dodecanol. Key words: incipient wetness impregnation; highly dispersed; copper; supported catalyst; citric acid; hydrogenolysis The hydrogenolysis of fatty acid methyl esters to fatty al- cohols is an important step in producing oleochemicals from vegetable oils [1–3]. Fatty alcohols are the next largest basic oleochemical after fatty acids [2]. They are used primarily as raw materials for the synthesis of surfactants and lubricants [2,4]. A typical industrial process involves the use of slurry or fixed-bed hydrogenation reactors at pressure ranging from 25 to 35 MPa and temperature from 250 to 300 ºC [5,6]. The catalysts of choice for the highly selective conversion of esters to alcohols usually contain copper as the active component and has other elements as promoters [6–9]. In particular, many studies of ester hydrogenolysis were based on the use and continuous modification of the classical Cu-Cr catalyst [10–17]. Cu-based catalysts are selective in the hydrogenation of car- bon-oxygen bonds but remain relatively inactive in car- bon-carbon bond hydrogenolysis. Cu alone is generally not active enough for hydrogenolysis [10,18,19]. The present in- dustrial goal is the production of longer chain fatty alcohols (C 12 –C 18 ) from the hydrogenation of oleochemical derivatives and this needs the developing of an improved Cu-based Cr-free catalyst [6,20]. A Cu-based catalyst promoted with Zn is deemed the most promising at present. The role of Zn in Cu-based catalysts for ester hydrogenolysis is unclear and still under debate. The general understanding of the hydrogena- tion/hydrogenolysis reaction is that the increase in activity with Cu-Zn catalysts is due to either the enhancement of finely dispersed copper particles by the Zn-containing phase (mor- phology model) [16,21–32] or from the synergistic effects on copper metal crystallites by zinc oxide particles (alloy model) [10,19,33–42]. According to the first view, a Cu catalyst without an additional promoting element may be made active for hydrogenolysis if the Cu particles were suitably dispersed on a support. This paper describes a way to synthesize a highly dispersed unpromoted copper catalyst on mesoporous silica using citric acid as dispersing agent. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Cu catalyst was prepared by the following procedure. Cu salt solution was prepared in stock (0.5 g/ml) from Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O salt (Alfa Aesar, 98%–102%). Citric acid (Fluka, 99%) was added in the molar ratio of 1:1 with respect to the metal. The extreme acidic solutions were adjusted to pH 7 by ammonium hydroxide (J.T. Baker, 28%–35% NH 3 ). An adequate amount of the homogeneous solution was then in- troduced slowly into 5 g of silica CS2050 (PQ Corp.) by a Ming-Hoong LOOI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 566–570 micro-pipette to achieve the nominal metal loading of 30 wt%. The sample was shaken throughout the impregnation process and this was continued for 30 min more to ensure a homoge- neous solution in the support. This sample was designated CA30. The impregnated materials were dried in an air oven at 110 ºC for 16 h with a heating rate of 5 ºC/min. The sample was then calcined in a static oven (atmospheric condition) at 450 ºC for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 ºC/min. The calcined material was then reduced under a purified hydrogen flow in a glass reactor heated from ambient to 350 ºC with a ramp of 5 ºC/min and held at 350 ºC for 2 h. The reduced catalyst was cooled to ambient temperature under nitrogen and sealed in a bulb. For comparison, a second sample, NA30, was prepared in the same way as the first but without citric acid. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The specific surface area was determined from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured at � 96 ºC using a Thermo-Finnigan Sorptomatic 1990 by the BET method. The pore distribution was obtained by the BJH method. The sam- ples were degassed for 12 h at 120 ºC before measurement. Copper loadings were confirmed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with a Bruker A4 Explorer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance diffracto- meter (Bragg-Brentano geometry, Cu K . radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA, graphite secondary monochromator, scintillation counter). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experi- ments of the calcined samples were carried out in 5% H 2 /N 2 at a flow rate of 90 ml/min using a ThermoQuest TPDRO 1100 apparatus. The temperature was linearly raised from 30 to 1000 ºC at a rate of 5 ºC/min and the H 2 consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. Surface morphologies of the samples were observed using a Philips Quanta FEG 200 scan- ning electron microscope (SEM). 1.3 Catalyst testing The catalyst was tested for the hydrogenation of methyl laurate in a high pressure batch reactor (standard split-seal design, Parr Autoclaves). The sealed catalyst bulb was mounted onto the reactor. The reactor vessel was filled with 40 ml of methyl laurate. The reaction was conducted at 250 ºC and 10 MPa of H 2 . The reaction was initiated when the sealed bulb was broken by the stirrer. The H 2 pressure was kept constant by replenishing the hydrogen consumed. At the end of the 4 h reaction, the reaction product was collected, filtered, and ana- lyzed by a calibrated GC using tetradecane (Aldrich) as internal standard. The GC was equipped with a Varian capillary CP-wax 52 CB column (30 m with an internal diameter of 0.32 mm and a film thickness of 0.25 m) and a flame ionization detector (FID). 2 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of the catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 1. For dried CA30, not much information with respect to the possible presence of crystalline phases was revealed. Only a broad hump associated with the silica support was seen. In contrast, dried NA30 showed the presence of crystalline mate- rials even before a high temperature treatment. Two crystalline phases were identified. The main diffraction peaks at 12.9°, 25.9°, 33.8°, 36.7°, and 43.8° were attributed to the presence of gerhardtite (Cu 4 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 6 , JCPDS 74-1749). The prominent twin peaks at 35.7° and 38.7° along with smaller diffraction peaks at 43.8°, 58.1°, and 75.2° were attributed to tenorite (CuO, JCPDS 45-0937). This shows that the simple act of adding citric acid resulted in different formation mechanisms in the two samples. Dried CA30 probably comprised thin film of copper citrate covering the support which resulted in only partial loss of surface area and pore volume as shown in Table 1. On the other hand, the loss of surface area and pore volume in dried NA30 was much more extensive and can be attributed to the precipitation of crystalline tenorite and gerhardtite that block nitrogen access to internal pores. TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 2. For calcined NA30, the main peak was observed at 320 ºC with a shoulder at 350 ºC. A minor peak was also observed at 240 ºC. These multiple re- duction peaks were due to the heterogeneously formed CuO particles existing as large and dense aggregates as seen in SEM (Fig. 3), with sizes typically in the range of 10–20 m. The compact forms offered a strong transport hindrance to oxygen migration through the thick layers of already reduced material and resulted in the apparent delays in reduction. For calcined Fig. 1.

Ming-Hoong LOOI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 566–570 CA30, the reduction occurred at a lower temperature (260 ºC) with the onset at 150 ºC. A calculation based on hydrogen consumption showed that CA30 can be reduced up to 96% as compared to 81% for NA30. The easier reduction of CA30 is in agreement with the SEM observation that the CuO particles of CA30 were smaller (typically < 50 nm), more uniform and better dispersed on the support than that of NA30. Hence, CA30 is more easily reduced because of the higher surface to volume ratio which facilitated the gas solid reaction. The results of the hydrogenolysis of methyl laurate to do- decanol by reduced CA30 and NA30 catalysts are reported in Table 2. The reaction results show that CA30 is a far superior catalyst to NA30, which was barely active. Dodecanol selec- tivity of 79% at 29% methyl laurate conversion under a rela- tively mild reaction condition was achieved. The intrinsic activity calculated was found to be the same for both catalysts. This implies that the reaction rate was directly correlated with the coverage of available Cu particles on the support. The extraordinary performance of CA30 compared to NA30 was therefore attributed to the use of citric acid that gave a high dispersion of Cu. The residue activity of NA30 is probably connected with the minor reduction peak preceding the main reduction event which, by inference to the reduction peak of CA30, has the correct range for methyl laurate hydrogenolysis.

Ming-Hoong LOOI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(6): 566–570 Therefore the low conversion of methyl laurate with NA30 was attributed to the low Cu exposure due to the formation of large aggregates such that only one third of the available Cu particles have the correct structure. 3 Conclusions This paper reports the beneficial effect of citric acid in pro- ducing a highly dispersed silica-supported Cu catalyst. Citric acid chelated with the Cu ion in the metal salt solution and formed a Cu-citrate thin film on the silica support upon drying, so that Cu ions were kept isolated from each other and ag- glomeration was minimized. A highly dispersed catalyst was obtained after the decomposition of the citrate anion during calcination. This preparation demonstrated that an active catalyst for hydrogenolysis can be obtained without the use of an additional promoting element by suitably dispersing Cu particles onto a support. The silica supported Cu catalyst pre- pared in this work was active for methyl laurate hydrogenoly- sis. References [1] Basiron Y, Amiruddin M N, Abdullah R.

The synthesis was studied by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and temperature programmed reduction by comparing with a reference prepared without citric acid. The catalyst precursor obtained after impregnation was X-ray amorphous. The precursor was readily transformed to crystalline CuO upon calcination. The CuO particles were of uniform size in a highly dispersed state and can be reduced to Cu at a lower temperature. The activity of the Cu catalyst obtained was an order of magnitude higher than that of the reference for the hydrogenolysis of methyl laurate to dodecanol.",
