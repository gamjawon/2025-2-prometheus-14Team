Graphical abstract The bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) material with a strong electric field as intercalation of lithium-sulfur battery to effectively catalyze the transformation of polysulfide and inhibit shuttle effect. The shuttle effect of polysulfides is a major challenge for the commercialization of lithium-sulfur battery. The systematic modification of separators has the potential to solve these problems by enhancing the adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Herein, strong internal electric field bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) nanoflowers decorated conductive carbon (DC + BOC) is proposed to be systematically modified on separator. This intermediate layer not only possesses a strong affinity for polysulfides, but also promotes the conversion of polysulfides and induces the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, thereby improving the rate performance and cycling stability of the battery. As expected, the modified membrane achieved a high specific capacity of 713 mA h g−1 at 5 C. At 1 C, high reversibility of 719 mA h g−1 was achieved after 550 cycles with only 0.044% decay per cycle. More importantly, under the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2, the area specific capacity remained at 4.1 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles, and the attenuation rate per cycle was only 0.056%. This work provides a new strategy to overcome the shuttle effect of polysulfide, and shows great potential in the application of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Keywords Interlayer Strong built-in electric field Catalytic Shuttle effect Lithium−sulfur battery 1 Introduction Under the growing demand for high energy density storage, lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) exhibits high theoretical energy density (2500 W h kg−1), and high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1) have become one of the potential batteries [1–6]. Although it meets the needs of current social development, the commercialization of LSB is very sluggish because the working principle of LSB is more complicated than that of lithium-ion batteries. Among them, in addition to the solid-phase S8 and Li2S, LSB will also generate intermediate polysulfides that dissolve in the electrolyte during the electrochemical reaction [7–10]. These polysulfides cause shuttle effect, resulting in irreversible loss of sulfur, corrosion of the lithium surface and rapid decay of battery life [11–16]. In recent years, an efficient “outside” cathode design strategy has been developed to block the shuttle path by modifying or coating the separator with a barrier layer [17–20]. For example, Manthiram group took the lead in inserting a carbon material interlayer between the separator and cathode to improve the cycling performance of LSB [21,22]. Along this line, various derived carbon-based materials have been studied to modify the separator [23–29]. The carbon coating effectively adsorb polysulfides in the early stage of battery cycling. However, during long-term charge-discharge cycling, the adsorbed polysulfides cannot be further converted and utilized over time, and due to the weak interaction between the non-polar carbon materials and polar polysulfide, the adsorbed polysulfide will fall off [30–32]. Recently, metal-based catalysts have been widely used for separator modification due to their strong affinity for polysulfides and rapid catalytic conversion, which can effectively avoid excessive adsorption of polysulfides and reduce the blockage of adsorption sites [33–39]. Based on this, the ideal performance was obtained by simply compounding metal compound with carbon materials. For example, Zhang et al. developed a Ni nanoparticle embedded in silicon dioxide (Ni/SiO2) nanosheet spheres that was mixed with graphene and then coated on the separator as a highly efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) barrier layer. The LiPSs is anchored by the affinity of SiO2 and Ni atoms for LiPSs. The rapid conversion between LiPSs and Li2S2/Li2S is achieved through abundant Ni catalytic sites [40]. Therefore, the composite of carbon materials and metal-based catalysts have dual functions of capturing and further converting polysulfides during battery applications, implying that this method is a feasible solution to restrain polysulfide shuttle effect. Bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) with “Aurivillius” oxide structure is one of the representatives in bismuth-based compound semiconductors. Bi2O2CO3 (BOC) exhibits a typical “Sillén” structure, i.e., the (Bi2O2)2+ and (CO3)2− atomic layer are alternately arranged, forming a highly asymmetric structure, which is obviously beneficial to the formation of special two-dimensional planar BOC sheets [41]. Furthermore, due to the unique crystal structure, a strong built-in electric field exists between the (Bi2O2)2+ and the (CO3)2− atomic layer [41–43]. The internal electric field induces macroscopic charges on BOC surface, resulting in a large number of polar molecules from the external environment being chemically adsorbed on the surface to shield these surface charges [44]. Considering that polysulfide is also heteropolar, we speculate that BOC materials with strong electric field inside rely on enhanced polysulfide capture strategy to solve the shuttle effect. To prove this hypothesis, we reasonably designed and constructed BOC materials with flower-like structure, and used BOC nanoflowers mixed with conductive carbon (DC) as the barrier layer of sulfur cathode in LSB. Due to the strong electric field inside the BOC nanoflowers, the shuttle effect of the isomeric polysulfides is effectively inhibited. Meanwhile, the barrier layer exhibits a strong catalytic effect on polysulfides. As expected, a high reversibility of 719 mA h g−1 with coulomb efficiency of 99% after 550 cycles at 1 C, and the capacity attenuation rate of 0.0438% per cycle. In addition, when the sulfur loading is 5.1 mg cm−2, the areal capacity of 4.1 mA h cm−2 can be still obtained after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. Therefore, the BOC material with a strong electric field shows a strong application potential in solving the slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur battery. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Bi2O2CO3 materials BOC was prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. Firstly, dissolve Na2CO3 in a mixed solution of deionized water and ethylene glycol and stir for 30 min, then add bismuth citrate and continue stirring for another 30 min, then transfer to a Teflon-lined stainles steel autoclave, heat to 160 °C, and react for 24 h. After the reaction, the solid was washed with water and ethanol for many times and centrifuged. Finally placed in a 60 °C vacuum oven for drying. 2.2 Synthesis of modified separator In a typical procedure, DC, BOC and polyvinyliden fluoride (PVDF) were uniformly mixed in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solution at a ratio of 8:1:1 and coated on one side of polypropylene membrane (PP Celgard 2500). Finally, DC + BOC/PP was vacuum dried at 60 °C for 10 h. The other functionalized separators were performed in the same steps. 2.3 Characterization methods The crystallographic structure of the material was tested by X‐ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology of the material was obtained by scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 650 fileds emission (FE)‐SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was measured by an ASAP2020 HD88 instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Dimond PE analytical system from 40 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. Using a liquid ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (UV-1800) to analysis and test of polysulfides at the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis was performed on Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha. 2.4 Electrochemical performance measurements CV measurements were collected using the electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) with the scan frequency range from 10−2 HZ to 105 HZ. Obtain galvanostatic charge-discharge curves and cycle performance on a LAND test system (LAND-CT2001A). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Composition and morphology A typical process for the preparation of flower-like BOC by a simple hydrothermal method is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The detailed synthesis process is shown in the experimental section. After hydrothermal reaction, the target of gray powder was obtained. The morphology and structure of BOC were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), XRD and Raman. The typical SEM image of Fig. 1(b and c) shows that the morphology of BOC is a three-dimensional flower-like nanosphere structure formed by self-assembly of ultra-thin nanosheets (ca. 5 nm), with the particle size of about 800 nm. The TEM image also confirms the microsphere structure of BOC (Fig. S1). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows a set of lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.295 nm, corresponding to the (013) crystal plane of the orthogonal BOC (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, obvious lattice defects can be observed. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of prepared BOC is shown in Fig. S2. BET surface analysis result shows that its specific surface area is 40.6 m2 g−1, which is a typical IV-type curve and an obvious H3-type isotherm under high relative pressure, which is related to the existence of mesopores and macropores [45]. Fig. 1(e) depicts the XRD pattern of the prepared BOC. All diffraction peaks are indexed by the standard data of tetragonal phase BOC structure (JCPDS no. 41-1488), and no other impurity phases were found, indicating that the pure tetragonal phase BOC had been obtained [46,47]. The results are consistent with high resolution TEM. Note that the internal strong electric field due to the BOC asymmetric structure can induce non-overlapping charges in the cell center of a single dielectric transistor to form an electric dipole moment. The XRD data are refined and analyzed by Rietveld method to obtain detailed structure information (Table S1). These BOCs with I4/mm space group do not show electrical properties when the lattice parameters c/a = 3.1. The lattice parameter c/a ratio of the synthesized BOC nanoflowers is 3.6, which indicates that the synthesized BOC nanoflowers are elongated along the Z direction, thus inducing spontaneous polarization [41]. Unfortunately, changing the hydrothermal reaction temperature can adjust the morphology of BOC (Fig. S3). Interestingly, controlling the hydrothermal reaction time affect the degree of BOC defects (Fig. S4). The XRD data of BOC obtained at different reaction times were refined and analyzed by Rietveld method to obtain detailed structural information (Table S2 and S3). The fitting results show that the crystallinity of BOC decreases with the shortening of reaction time, which leads to the increase of defects. Furthermore, Raman spectra further verified that there was a strong electric field inside the synthesized BOC. The mixture of Raman scattering characteristics of symmetric and asymmetric crystal structures can be observed around 75, 161, 360, 666 and 1069 cm−1 (Fig. 1f). The Raman scattering band of A1 at 161 cm−1, B1, E are at 360 cm−1, E, A1 are at 666 cm−1 and E, A1 are at 1069 cm−1, which is attributed to the spontaneous polarization of BOC nanoflowers with strong electric field inside [43,48]. This is mainly due to a large number of defects in BOC lattice, which destroyed the electric field balance between layers in the crystal. In addition, the existence of strong electric field in BOC was further verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The structure model of BOC is constructed (Fig. S5), and the differential charge density of (Bi2O3)2+ and (CO3)2− layers in BOC structure is calculated. As shown in Fig. 1(g), there is an electric field distribution (Bader charge is 1.83 e) between the (CO3)2− and (Bi2O3)2+ layers, indicating that an electric field is formed between the two layers, which is consistent with the results of XRD and Raman analysis. The electric field generated by strong internal electric field in BOC possesses a good adsorption effect on both liquid Li2S n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and solid Li2S2/Li2S. As shown in Fig. 1(h), the adsorption mode of liquid lithium polysulfide on BOC. The (Bi2O3)2+ layer adsorbs polysulfide to form monodentate Bi-S bond, while a single Li atom in Li2Sn is bonded by two surface O atoms in (CO3)2− layer. Compared with the soluble Li2S n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8), two Li atoms in the solid Li2S2/Li2S are simultaneously adsorbed in a bidentate mode (Fig. 1i). This bidentate adsorption modes will cause the binding energy of Li2S2/Li2S to be significantly higher than that of soluble Li2S n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) [49]. 3.2 Catalytic performance analysis The role of BOC in inhibiting the shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur battery was explored by constructing a BOC and DC composite interlayer (named DC + BOC). It can be seen from the SEM cross-section that the thickness of the coating on the modified separator is about ∼15.5 μm, and the side view illustrates that the BOC + DC coating layer only covers one side of PP (Fig. S6). Besides that, the BOC + DC composite intercalation exhibits strong adhesion with the PP separators, and maintains high stability after repeated bending and wrinkling without mechanical delamination (Fig. S7). More importantly, the mass of the composite intercalation was only increased by 5% compared to that of the pure PP separator, indicating that the energy density of the battery was not significantly reduced. The sulfur cathode of lithium-sulfur battery was prepared by coating 70% elemental sulfur in hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH) by melting method (Fig. S8). The strong internal electric field of BOC nanoflowers is the key to realize the embedding of polar polysulfide to improve Li-S battery (Fig. 2 a). Fig. 2(b) compares the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of cells assembled with various interlayers and PP at a voltage range of 1.7–2.7 V under a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1. For the discharge, there are two distinguishable reduction peaks, which represent the transformation of solid elemental sulfur into long-chain soluble Li2S n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and further reduction of insoluble Li2S2 or Li2S. The two obvious oxidation peaks also can be observed, which correspond to the reverse reaction of the reduction reaction [40,50]. Compared with other batteries, the CV curves of the DC + BOC/PP battery not only shows that the reduction peak shifts to a higher voltage, and the oxidation peak shifts to a lower voltage, and the peak current also increases. These results all indicate that BOC can improve the utilization of sulfur, increase the kinetics of redox reactions, and inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Furthermore, the catalytic effect of BOC was further confirmed by comparing the Tafel slopes, and the Tafel plots also reflected the electron transfer rate [51]. As depicted in Fig. 2(c–e), the DC + BOC/PP cell has the minimum Tafel slope at S8 to Li2S n with a slope of 94.7 mV dec−1 and Li2S n to Li2S with a slope of 43.3 mV dec−1. When Li2S was converted to Li2S n , the Tafel slope is still only 57.7 mV dec−1, which is the smallest compared to other batteries. These results all suggest that BOC can effectively promote the redox reaction of sulfur species, whether it is solid-liquid conversion or liquid-solid conversion [51]. Next, the symmetric battery was assembled to further confirm the electrocatalytic activity and reversibility of BOC for lithium polysulfide [52]. In the course of the experiment, the catalytic effect of BOC electrodes with different ratios was mainly studied by CV. In the symmetric battery with 0.1 M Li2S6 as the electrolyte, symmetric electrodes with different contents of BOC and DC mixture exhibit different CV peak currents. The peak current of the symmetrical redox reaction increases significantly after adding BOC compared with the symmetrical battery with pure DC electrode (Fig. 2f). This result indicates that BOC exhibits the effect of catalyzing the conversion of lithium polysulfide. In addition, an interesting phenomenon worth noting was that the lower the mass ratio of BOC to DC, the more favorable it was to catalyze the redox reaction of lithium polysulfide. This is mainly due to the BOC possess a strong electric field inside, which only needs a small amount to effectively adsorb and convert polysulfides, and excessive BOC will reduce the charge mass and charge transfer (Fig. S9). When the content of BOC is only 10%, the new oxidation peak and reduction peak appear at 0.41 and −0.41 V respectively. Moreover, the two obvious redox peaks observed were ascribed to the multistep lithium polysulfide conversion reactions [53]. Meanwhile, based on the BOC content of 10% (Fig. S10), these oxidation-reduction peaks still exist on the CV curves at different scanning rates, indicating that BOC still exhibits a good catalytic conversion effect at high current density [54]. In addition to comparing electrodes with different BOC content to CV to study symmetric coin cells, we also use the same method to test asymmetric coin cells. Lithium metal and sulfur-free 10% BOC electrodes were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. When using conventional electrolyte, the BOC-based electrode did not appear any obvious redox peaks during multiple cycles of scanning (Fig. 2g). In sharp contrast, when 0.1 M Li2S6 was used as electrolyte, the BOC-based electrode showed various obvious redox peaks in multiple scanning cycles at the same scanning speed. These peaks can be attributed to the redox reaction of polysulfide. All the results suggest that BOC can accelerate the conversion of polysulfide and improve the efficiency of sulfur utilization. In addition, BOC and DC will not provide too much capacity for lithium intercalation and deintercalation under the normal charging and discharging voltage of the battery. In order to further evaluate the superiority of BOC in the deep transformation of polysulfides and the inhibition of shuttle effect. The experimental verification of Li2S deposition by constant voltage chronoamperometry (Fig. 2h and i) was performed on BOC-based and BOC-free materials [55]. The result shows that BOC effectively shorten the nucleation time of Li2S. The Li2S precipitation capacity of the BOC battery analyzed by calculation was 198.2 mA h g−1, which was greater than the precipitation capacity (173.3 mA h g−1) of the battery without BOC. The experimental results of Li2S deposition further prove that BOC significantly promote the conversion of lithium polysulfide to Li2S. 3.3 Theoretical calculation The sulfur reduction reaction basically includes the transformation of solid phase S8 into soluble Li2S n (4 ≤ n ≤ 8), and then into solid Li2S2/Li2S [49]. To this end, we simulated the adsorption structures of ring S8 and Li2S n (1 ≤ n ≤ 8) on BOC (013) and DC by DFT, to further verify that BOC effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics of polysulfides. As shown in Fig. 3 (a and b), the annular S8 is parallel to the surfaces of BOC and DC, with a distance of 0.32 and 0.36 nm, respectively. However, the SS bond in S8 exhibits the same length (≈0.21 nm) before and after adsorbing the two materials, which indicates that there is a weak physical adsorption between S8 and the two materials. Compared with DC, the Li2S n (1 ≤ n ≤ 8) adsorbed on BOC is slightly deformed. This is mainly due to the formation of chemical bonds between Li+ and S n 2− with O, Bi atoms in the (CO3)2− and (Bi2O3)2+ layers, respectively. This is also the important evidence that BOC effectively adsorb polysulfide and inhibit shuttle effect. For heterogeneous catalysis, the firmly anchoring of the reactant polysulfides at the active sites is a prerequisite for the catalytic reaction [56]. From Fig. 3(c), the binding energies of various polysulfides on the BOC surface calculated based on DFT are much stronger than on DC. Moreover, we further constructed the reaction pathway by considering the polysulfide intermediates of *S8, *Li2S8, *Li2S6, *Li2S4, *Li2S2 and *Li2S to evaluate the catalytic performance of BOC (Fig. 3d). Compared with DC, BOC greatly reduced the energy barrier for polysulfide conversion, implying that BOC accelerate the catalytic conversion of polysulfide. The above analysis shows that BOC with strong internal electric field increase the adsorption and accelerate the oxidation-reduction reaction of polysulfides, thus effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect. 3.4 Electrochemical performance The CV test was used to preliminarily evaluate the electrochemical reversibility of DC + BOC/PP between the potential range 1.7–2.7 V under a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1. Fig. 4 (a) shows the DC + BOC/PP exhibits a typical CV curve, with two reduction peaks at 2.33 V and 2.03 V, and two oxidation peaks also can be observed [57]. The CV curves almost completely overlap from the beginning of the second cycle, suggesting that the cell has excellent electrochemical reversibility and cycle stability. Fig. 4(b) presents the rate performance of batteries assembled with various separators. As expected, the DC + BOC/PP reaches higher reversible capacities, which are 1457, 1165, 1005, 906, 807 and 713 mA h g−1 corresponding to the current density gradually increases from 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 to 5 C (Table S4). In addition, when the current density returns to 0.2 C, most of the original capacity could be retained, implying excellent rate performance and durable sulfur electrochemistry. Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S11 record the charge and discharge curves of the cells at different current rates. Compared with other separators, the DC + BOC/PP possesses a smaller polarization potential, and there are still two obvious discharge platforms when the current density is 5 C, suggesting BOC effectively promote the conversion of polysulfides and increase the utilization rate of sulfur. In addition, the defects will change the electric field in BOC crystal, thus affecting the adsorption and catalytic activity of polysulfide. The electrochemical performance is not the best when the defect is the largest (Fig. S12), which is mainly due to the excessive defects of polysulfide adsorption energy is too high for the subsequent reaction, thereby reducing the polysulfide reaction kinetics. In order to further analyze the effects of various interlayers on charge transfer and ion diffusion, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under open circuit voltage (OCV) was tested. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the DC + BOC/PP exhibits a minimum charge transfer resistance (R ct) among the three samples. These results imply that the BOC accelerates the charge transfer and improves the redox reaction kinetics. The long cyclability of batteries with different separators were further tested and compared. As shown in Fig. 4(e), after 550 cycles at a current rate of 1 C, the DC + BOC/PP cell witnessed a smooth discharge capacity of 719 mA h g−1 (Table S5). The capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.044%, the average coulomb efficiency is stable at about 99%, and there is less polarization (Fig. S13). This result is obviously better than most literature reports (Table S6). By comparison, it was found that DC/PP and PP batteries exhibits lower discharge capacity and capacity retention rate. Interestingly, BOC with a strong internal electric field modified the separator to effectively adsorb polysulfides and accelerate the catalytic conversion of polysulfides, thereby inducing the formation of a stable SEI layer to reduce the corrosion on the surface of the lithium foil (see supporting information Fig. S14 for a detailed analysis). More importantly, BOC before and after the cycle was characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS and XRD. The results shows that BOC was still hierarchical three-dimensional flower-like nanosphere structure before and after the cycle, indicating that BOC exhibits good stability in the catalytic conversion of polysulfides (see Fig. S15 for detailed analysis). In addition, batteries with high sulfur loadings were also assembled considering practical applications and research on high energy density lithium-sulfur batteries [58,59]. When the sulfur loading is 5.1 mg cm−2, the DC + BOC/PP cell exhibits better areal capacities than commercial Li-ion batteries after 200 cycles [60]. Notably, the initial capacity of 4.5 mA h cm−2 was achieved at 0.1 C, and the area specific capacity remained at 4.1 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles with only 0.056% attenuation per cycle. These electrochemical performance results favorably confirm the significant superiority of BOC for increasing redox kinetics, improving sulfur utilization and inhibiting lithium dendrite growth, with a stable structure. The capture effect of the prepared intercalation to polysulfides and its interaction were investigated visually by combining the adsorption experiment of Li2S6, the ultraviolet-visible spectrum (UV-vis) and the XPS. Add equal amounts of DC + BOC and DC to the glass bottle containing Li2S6 solution, let stand for a while, and observe the color change of the supernatant. As expected, the DC + BOC sample supernatant had become colorless after 24 h, while the DC sample only lightened from tawny (inset Fig. 5 a). This phenomenon directly proves that BOC exhibits a strong chemical affinity for polysulfides. This is consistent with the UV-vis spectra data, with a prominent absorption peak at 261 nm in the upper solution of the DC sample, attributed to Li2S6. In comparison, there is a weak absorption peak at 261 nm in the supernatant of the DC + BOC sample, suggesting that most of the soluble Li2S6 has been absorbed [61]. In addition, the underlying interaction mode between Li2S6 and BOC was further investigated via XPS test. Fig. 5(b) shows the Bi 4f spectra of BOC as pristine and after adsorption Li2S6. There are two obvious peaks at 164.5 and 159.2 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f 7/2 [47], respectively. Compared with pure BOC, after adsorption of Li2S6, two new peaks appeared at 163.9 and 158.7 eV, corresponding to Bi–S bond [33,47]. Similarly, after adsorption of Li2S6, a strong Bi–S bond also appeared in S 2p spectrum (Fig. 5c), which was consistent with the results of DFT analysis. These results all indicate that Bi2+ in BOC exhibits a strong chemical affinity with S atoms in polysulfides. At the same time, in the Li 1s spectrum, a stronger Li–S bond was shown under the action of BOC (Fig. 5d), indicating that the introduction of BOC accelerated the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S. The above analysis shows that BOC exhibits strong adsorption capacity and rapid catalytic conversion to polysulfide, and then effectively inhibits the shuttle effect of polysulfide. 4 Conclusions We demonstrated the preparation of BOC with highly asymmetric structure, which can effectively adsorb polysulfide by using its strong electric field, and Bi metal center shows excellent catalytic activity to accelerate the oxidation-reduction reaction of sulfur substances. As expected, the battery assembled with DC + BCO/PP as separator exhibits obvious promotion in sulfur utilization, reaction kinetics, and capacity retention rate. Such cell displays a discharge capacity of 713 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 C, a high reversibility of 719 mA h g−1 with Coulomb efficiency of 99% after 550 cycles at 1 C. In addition, when the sulfur loading is 5.1 mg cm−2, the areal capacity of 4.1 mA h cm−2 can be still obtained after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. This work provides a possible route for bismuth-based photocatalytic materials to capture and catalyze polysulfides in LSBs. Simultaneously, it also provides a new idea for more photocatalytic materials to be applied to LSBs. This work introduced in this paper provides a new polysulfide capture strategy to overcome polysulfide shuttle, thereby improve the life of LSBs, although the basic understanding of polysulfide capture mechanism through internal strong electric field with Aurivillius oxide structure is still unclear. In addition, due to its simple operation, low cost and easy seamless coupling with the current commercial battery manufacturing process, this method shows great potential in the application of high-performance LSBs.

        "dc:description": "The shuttle effect of polysulfides is a major challenge for the commercialization of lithium-sulfur battery. The systematic modification of separators has the potential to solve these problems by enhancing the adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Herein, strong internal electric field bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) nanoflowers decorated conductive carbon (DC + BOC) is proposed to be systematically modified on separator. This intermediate layer not only possesses a strong affinity for polysulfides, but also promotes the conversion of polysulfides and induces the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, thereby improving the rate performance and cycling stability of the battery. As expected, the modified membrane achieved a high specific capacity of 713 mA h g−1 at 5 C. At 1 C, high reversibility of 719 mA h g−1 was achieved after 550 cycles with only 0.044% decay per cycle. More importantly, under the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2, the area specific capacity remained at 4.1 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles, and the attenuation rate per cycle was only 0.056%. This work provides a new strategy to overcome the shuttle effect of polysulfide, and shows great potential in the application of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.",
