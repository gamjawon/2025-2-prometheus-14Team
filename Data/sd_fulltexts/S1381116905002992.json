Graphical abstract Polyvinyl chloride–polyethylene–polyamine supported palladium complexes are efficient catalysts for Heck reaction of acrylic acid with aryl iodides in air at the low temperature (50°C) using 0.125mol% of the catalysts. Effect of amount of the catalyst indicates that the Heck reaction acrylic acid with iodobenzene can be carried out with tiny amount of the catalyst (0.02%) at 90°C. The complexes have high thermal stability and can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and reused many times. Two kinds of polyvinyl chloride–polyethylene–polyamine supported palladium complexes were synthesized and characterized by XPS, TG, DTA, TEM, etc. These complexes are efficient catalysts for Heck reaction of acrylic acid with aryl iodides in air at the low temperature (50°C) using 0.125mol% of the catalysts. Effect of amount of the catalyst indicates that the Heck reaction acrylic acid with iodobenzene can be carried out with tiny amount of the catalyst (0.02%) at 90°C. The complexes have high thermal stability and can be easily recovered and reused. Yields of making cinnamic acid were even high as 68.3 and 78.0% respectively for Heck reaction of acrylic acid with iodobenzene by using the two complexes that were recovered for 12 times. Keywords Polyvinyl chloride Polyethylene–polyamine Palladium Supported catalyst Heck reaction 1 Introduction The palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction [1] has received considerable attention in recent years [2], as it offers a versatile method for the generation of new CC bonds in organic synthesis. The reaction is normally carried out with a palladium catalyst (PdCl2) about 1mol% of reactant, a phosphine ligand, and a base in homogeneous mode of operation. However, the reaction suffers from severe problems related with the separation, recovery and the instability of the homogeneous catalysts at high temperatures, which have so far precluded its widespread industrial application. These problems can be overcome, however, by the use of heterogeneous catalysts, made up of supported palladium complex. These complexes include polymer supported palladium catalysts, palladium on carbon [3], palladium-supported metal oxides [4], clays [5], zeolites [6], and molecular sieves [7]. Polymer-supported metal complexes having high activity and selectivity are currently attracting great interest because they can be easily separated and recovered. Andersson et al. [8] reported that polystyrene-supported phosphine palladium complex with a Pd/P of 1/1 showed very high activity in the arylation of methyl acrylate and styrene with iodobenzene. They found that the catalyst was more efficient than Pd/C, Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(OAc)2/2PPh3, or Pd(PPh3)4, but noticeable deactivation of catalyst during repeated use was detected. Schwarz et al. [9] found that polymer-supported carbene palladium complexes were air stable and recyclable catalysts for Heck reaction. Uozumi and Kimura [10] studied Heck reaction of various aryl halides with alkenes proceeding in water in the presence of a palladium complex of a PS-PEG resin supported triarylphosphine ligand. Organosilicon polymer supported palladium catalysts for Heck reactions have also been reported recently [11]. Buchmeiser and Wurst [12] have made efforts in the same field as polymer supported catalysts for Heck reactions. All these catalysts show good catalytic activity for the Heck reaction, but the preparations of the catalyst supports involve many steps. Polyvinyl chloride modified by functional group can be prepared via displacement reaction directly without chloromethylation and makes its inexpensive and practical support for heterogeneous catalyst. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of these two kinds of polyvinyl chloride–polyethylene–polyamine supported palladium complexes and the application of these complexes in Heck arylation of alkenes that can afford excellent yield and high trans-selectivity. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Acrylic acid, styrene and DMF were distilled before use. 4-Iodoanise (98%), 1-iodo-4-nitrobenzene (98%), 4-iodotoluene (98%), and 1-iodo-4-chlorobenzene (98%) were obtained from Lancaster company and were used as received. All other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received. 2.2 Measurements X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured on an AXISULTRA spectrometer (Kratos, Company England) using mono-Al Kα radiation. The C 1s photoelectron line was used for energy calibration and the C 1s binding energy was taken to be 284.8eV. The thermal analysis was performed on an EXSTAR6000 (Seiko Company, Japan) thermal analysis system at a heating rate of 10°C/min, and in air atmosphere. TEM images were obtained on a JEM100-CXIITEM instrument (JEOL Company, Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 100kV. 2.3 Preparation of the catalysts Polyvinyl chloride–ethylenediamine (abbreviated as PVC–EN) and polyvinyl chloride–diethylenetriamine (abbreviated as PVC–DTA) were prepared according to the procedure in literature [13]. Polyvinyl chloride (2.0g) was added to ethylenediamine (20mL) in a round-bottomed flask, then, 4mL of H2O was added, the mixture was stirred at 60°C in the air for 8h. After being cooled to room temperature, and the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with plenty of H2O and then dried at 80°C in the air for 12h to give 2.2g of brown PVC–EN. PVC–DTA (2.3g) was prepared according to the same procedure. To a solution of PVC–EN (2.0g) in acetone (50mL), PdCl2 (0.3g) was added. The mixture was stirred at 60°C in the air for 72h. After being cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with acetone (3× 20mL) and H2O (3× 20mL) and then dried at 100°C in vacuum for 6h to give 2.2g of puce polyvinyl chloride–ethylenediamine supported palladium complex (abbreviated as PVC–EN–Pd). Another puce complex, polyvinyl chloride–diethylenetriamine supported palladium complex (abbreviated as PVC–DTA–Pd) (2.2g) was prepared according to the same procedure (Scheme 1 ). 2.4 Catalytic reactions 2.4.1 Typical procedure for the Heck arylation of aryl halides with acrylic acid PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd complex (0.1mol%), acrylic acid (6.0mmol), aryl halides (5mmol), tributylamine (12.0mmol) and DMF (1mL) were taken in a round-bottomed flask and stirred at 90°C in the air for 3h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, H2O (25mL) and Na2CO3 (1.0g) were added. After stirring for 10min, PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd complex was separated by filtration. The filtrate was treated with 3N HCl (5mL). The precipitate was filtered, washed with H2O (2× 15mL) and dried in the air to give trans-cinnamic acid. 2.4.2 Typical procedure for the Heck arylation of aryl halides with styrene PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd complex (0.1mol%), styrene (6.0mmol), aryl halides (5mmol), tributylamine (6.0mmol) and DMF (1mL) were taken in a round-bottomed flask and stirred at 90°C in the air for 3h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and dissolved in Et2O (30mL). PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd complex was recovered from the mixture by filtration, and was washed with distilled H2O (2× 15mL), EtOH (2× 15mL) and Et2O (2× 15mL). The filtrate was treated with 3N HCl (2× 15mL), brine (3× 15mL) and dried over MgSO4. The solid product was obtained by recrystallization from Et2O to give trans-stilbene. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts XPS is used to study not only the coordination of macromolecular ligands and metal ions but also the chemical state of palladium presenting in the supported catalysts. The binding energies of Pd, PdCl2, PVC–EN, PVC–DTA, PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd obtained in the XPS analysis are summarized in Table 1 . The binding energies of Pd 3d5/2 of PVC–EN–Pd are 335.5 and 337.7, which suggests the existence of two different chemical state of Palladium, Pd0 and Pd2+. It can be seen that the binding energies of N 1s of PVC–EN–Pd also have two different data (339.4, 401.5) and the data are higher than those of PVC–DTA, which indicates the lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen transfers and the electron cloud density at nitrogen atom decreases. These results are probably due to the coordination of N with Pd0 or pd2+. The same outcomes almost can be obtained by analyzing the binding energies of PVC–DTA and PVC–DTA–Pd. Thermal stability of the catalyst has great effect on its catalytic activity and recyclability because Heck reaction is usually carried out under high temperature conditions. Figs. 1 and 2 show the TG and DTA curves of PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd respectively at atmospheric conditions. TG analysis show that PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd are stable up to 200 and 250°C respectively. DTA analysis of PVC–EN–Pd shows a strong exothermic peak at 400°C, corresponding to the oxidation of the polymer carrier, and a similar strong exothermic peak is found at 425°C for PVC–DTA–Pd. Figs. 3 and 4 show TEM images of PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd. TEM confirms that Pd particles have uniform distribution in both of the catalysts. The average size of the Pd particles is 10nm (PVC–EN–Pd) and 15nm (PVC–DTA–Pd) respectively. Thermal analysis and TEM analysis indicate that both PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd meet the basic qualifications as an efficient supported catalyst. 3.2 Heck arylation Most homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed Heck reactions were studied under inert conditions. However if PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd catalyst is used in Heck reaction, almost no catalytic activity difference was observed no matter they are carried out in the inert atmosphere or in the air (Table 2 , entry1–4). Such nature of the catalysts makes them convenient in industrial applications. The temperature that was required for Heck reaction is correlated with the catalyst adopted. The Heck reaction catalyzed by supported palladium complex is usually carried out at 100°C [8,11 e.g.,14]. However, high temperature is one of the important problems to restrict its widespread application. The influence of temperature on catalytic property of PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd was investigated by using Heck arylation of acrylic acid with iodobenzene. It can be seen from Table 2 that the reaction temperature has the same effect on the catalytic performance of these two catalysts. In the presence of PVC–EN–Pd or PVC–DTA–Pd, the Heck reaction can be carried out efficiently at low temperature (50°C) but the yield is not very high. The yield of the product increases while reaction time is reduced to 3h and the temperature arises from 50 to 90°C. As result, excellent yields could be obtained at 90–100°C with short reaction time (3h) in the air. It is a key issue to note that the amount of palladium catalyst plays an important role in the product yields. The arylation of acrylic acid with iodobenzene was studied with the amount of catalyst ranging from 0.02 to 0.5% (Table 3 ). It was found that the arylation could be carried out efficiently even with tiny amount of the catalyst (0.02%) at 90°C, the yield of the cinnamic acid was 75.7% (PVC–EN–Pd) and 76.0% (PVC–DTA–Pd). Increasing the amount of palladium catalyst gave higher yield and shorter reaction time until the amount of the catalyst increased to 0.1%. In order to reduce the cost, several groups [15] had focused on using low Pd-loading catalyst in Heck reaction. Reetz et al. [15b] reported the reaction of styrene with bromobenzene using only 0.0009mol% of Pd(OAc)2 (130°C), and the conversion turned out to be 85% after 96h. The low palladium concentration usually led to a long period of reaction, which was consistent with our experimental result. de Vries et al. [15c] concluded that the appropriate palladium concentration is between 0.01 and 0.1mol%. However, most of these catalytic systems are homogeneous and suffer from the problems related with the separation and recovery of the catalysts. PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd were evaluated in Heck arylation (Scheme 2 ) of aryl halide with acrylic acid or styrene using DMF as a solvent and tributylamine as base under atmospheric conditions. The aryl olefins were obtained with yields ranging from good to excellence (Table 4 ). IR and 1H NMR spectra of all products were conformed. It can be seen from the table that the Heck arylations of acrylic acid or styrene with aryl iodides can be efficiently carried out at 90°C to afford the trans-product in high yield, and cis-product was not observed. Neither electron-donating group nor electron-withdrawing group on aryl iodides has much effect on the yield of products. In presence of a catalytic amount of PPh3, the arylations of aryl bromides with acrylic acid or styrene can also be carried out at higher temperature (120°C) for longer time (5h). The results are similar to Cai's researches [11g], but the amount of the catalyst of 0.1mol% is much less than those of 0.6mol% reported by Cai et al. The catalysts were recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration after the arylation, washed with H2O, CH3CH2OH and CH3CH2OCH2CH3, then dried in air. Recyclabilities of the PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd were examined for the reaction of iodobenzene with acrylic acid. It can be seen from Table 5 that the catalytic activities of PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd are almost unchanged after seven times of recovery, and the difference between the catalytic activities of these two catalysts is not obvious. In the subsequent cycles, the catalytic activity of these two catalysts decrease observably, with PVC–EN–Pd decreasing faster than PVC–DTA–Pd, which probably attributed to the fact that PVC–EN–Pd has higher thermal stability than PVC–DTA–Pd. 4 Conclusions In summary, PVC–EN–Pd and PVC–DTA–Pd have been prepared easily by using inexpensive supports and exhibit high activity toward the Heck reaction of aryl iodides with olefins without inert atmosphere. Small amounts of catalysts (0.1%) and low temperature are required to perform the Heck reaction on aryl iodides. These catalysts can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and reused many times. The results show that these new supported palladium catalysts are very effective for Heck reaction under gentle conditions, such as low temperature without inert atmosphere, and should be considered as effective heterogeneous catalysts for Heck reaction.
