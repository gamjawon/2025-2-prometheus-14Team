We have studied the hydrogen storage at room temperature and high pressure on nickel catalysts impregnated on an amorphous commercial activated carbon. The catalysts were studied by means of the BET method, XRD, metal surface area and temperature programmed desorption. It was shown that the catalysts could store significant amounts of hydrogen at room temperature and high pressure (up to 0.53% at 30 bars against 0.1% for the activated carbon). Various factors influencing the level of hydrogen uptake were examined and discussed. The hydrogen spillover would be the driving force for the hydrogen storage. Two mechanisms of hydrogen uptake are proposed. Keywords Hydrogen Storage Metal Catalysts Activated carbon 1 Introduction Hydrogen storage has attracted considerable attention because of its potential application in high energy-density rechargeable batteries and hydrogen-powered vehicles [1–3]. In recent years, there has been considerable experimental and theoretical interest in the use of nano-structured carbon materials, especially in the form of tubes [4–7] fibers [8,9] and mechanically milled graphite [10] as potential hydrogen sorbents. The results of these studies show that high storage concentrations of hydrogen can be achieved. However, claims of hydrogen storage capacity higher than the US Department of Energy of 6.5% by weight have not been reproducible by other groups [7,11]. On the other hand, an important feature of the hydrogen storage is the use of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) in the synthesis of the carbonaceous materials which, in addition, cannot be completely removed during the purification process [12]. The nature of the factors that influence the level of hydrogen storage is still disputed. In the case of carbon nanofibers, it has been suggested that the presence of defects in the surface structure may dissociate hydrogen, which then intercalates in the graphene planes [12–14]. The pre-treatment in neutral, oxidative or reductive atmosphere may modify the structural properties of the carbon material in many ways: purification by removal of the adsorbed species [15], opening of the carbon structure [16], increased graphitization [17], activation of the solid [12]. Changes were also observed in the carbon material structure after exposure to high-pressure hydrogen [18]. As a result, the structural modifications induce important changes in the hydrogen storage of the materials treated [12,15–17]. Metals used as catalysts for the preparation of carbonaceous materials for hydrogen storage may play a role in the hydrogen uptake [19–23]. The real effect of monometallic nickel on the level of hydrogen storage has not still received much attention, although, it has been recently reported implications of hydrogen spillover from NiMgO oxide onto carbon nanotubes for hydrogen storage [12]. More generally, the effect of residual metals in hydrogen uptake has been largely unstudied and uncharacterized. This prompted us to study nickel catalysts supported on an amorphous commercial active carbon as materials for hydrogen storage. Activated carbon is a cheap material as compared to nano-structured synthetic carbon materials. Nickel is a metal widely used in the industry. We explored several factors determining the level of storage: nature of the metal precursor, metal loading, catalyst pre-treatment and support catalyst dilution. Conventional impregnation method, using nickel acetate or nitrate as precursors, was used for catalyst preparation. The catalysts were characterized by the BET method, XRD, metal surface area and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). 2 Experimental Activated carbon and Ni(CH3COO)2 ·4H2O (⩾99.0%) or Ni(NO3)2 ·6H2O (⩾99.0%) were purchased from Merck and Fluka, respectively. A fraction of 40 mesh activated carbon was used as a support. The catalyst precursor was prepared by classical impregnation of activated carbon with the appropriate nickel salt. The impregnated solid was dried in air at 383K overnight. The catalysts were denoted as xNi/AC–A(N), where AC refers to the active carbon support, A or N to the acetate or nitrate precursor, respectively, and x to the nickel content. The textural parameters of the materials were determined by N2 sorption at 77K, using an automatic Thermoquest Sorptomatic 1990 apparatus. Specific surface area and specific pore volume were determined according to BET method. Dubibin–Radushkevich method was used to determine the micropore volume. XRD patterns I(θ) were recorded at a classical θ/2θ diffractometer using CuKα radiation. Chemisorption and thermal treatment experiments were carried out as described in [24]. High-pressure hydrogen uptakes were assessed with a specially designed volumetric adsorption/desorption system. The unit consisted of a 4.13mL sample cell module connected to a reservoir; the standard reservoir volume used was 164mL. Pressure was measured with a pressure gauge. Materials for construction of the sample cell module, including valves and fittings, were chosen such that the vessel could be heated to 773K using an external source to outgas or activate the samples. The volume of the system, both with and without samples, was calibrated by attaching a reservoir with known volume to the sorption reservoir. Room temperature desorption was measured by allowing the gas in the sample cell to expand into the desorption reservoir for a series of measurements. Desorption measurements from each separate pressure expansion were summed to determine the total amount of hydrogen released. Initial sample mass for the high-pressure experiments was 400mg. Before starting the sorption, the sample was purged in vacuum for 1h at 473K. It was then activated for 3h at 623, 773 or 873K in hydrogen or 10min at 623K in air with a flow rate of 100mLmin−1. After the hydrogen pretreatment, the sample was swept with a helium flow (100mLmin−1) for 2h at 673K, then cooled to room temperature under the helium flow. After the air pretreatment, it was directly cooled to room temperature then swept with a helium flow (100 mLmin−1) for 2h. After the purging, the system was saturated in hydrogen for 16h at the desired pressure (20 or 30 bars). 3 Results 3.1 Textural and structural properties The textural and structural properties of the materials were determined after a pre-treatment under H2 at 623K for 3h. The activated carbon used has a BET surface area of 1073m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.596mLg−1 comprising 64% of micropores. The wet impregnation method causes the changes in the texture of the final materials. Low nickel loading (1wt%) almost does not change the specific surface area or pore volume. In contrast, larger Ni loading (5 or 10wt%) causes a significantly reduction of the specific surface area and total pore volume which decrease to 487m2 g−1 and 0.264mLg−1, respectively – but not that of micropores contribution. Pore blockage has been reported for Ni and Co activated charcoal supported catalysts after different treatment [25]. The blockage was related to the presence of different Ni or Co compounds during the catalyst preparation. The XRD spectrum of the activated carbon shows an amorphous structure. XRD patterns for the catalysts with 1 and 5wt% Ni did not show peaks due to the sensitivity of the technique which does not allow to detect low metal contents (⩽5%) or small metal particles (⩽5nm). The XRD pattern of the 10Ni/AC–A catalyst showed two large reflection signals (as illustrated in Fig. 1 ) at 44.59 (111) and 51.90° (200) 2Θ, characteristic of metallic nickel with a cfc structure. In the XRD spectrum of 10Ni/AC–N, the signals of Ni° are also present but their intensity are much lower. The kind of the nickel precursor determinates the particle size growth. 3.2 Metal surface area by H2-adsorption at atmospheric pressure The catalyst metal surface area was determined by H2-adsorption at room temperature and pressure after reduction of the samples at 623K/3h/H2. The hydrogen uptake is nil with the activated carbon. It changes with the nature of the precursor, the nickel content and the pre-treatment temperature. The metal surface area was calculated assuming a dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the nickel phase (Table 1 ). The acetate precursor gives lower metal surface areas (0.6–2.7m2 g−1) than the nitrate precursor (13.3–17.1m2 g−1), in good accordance with the XRD study, which showed that the kind of the nickel precursor determinates the metal dispersion. On the other hand, the metal area passes through a minimum or a maximum according to the nature of the precursor. The obtained results suggest that several factors may control the metal surface area of the catalysts. The larger metal area for the Ni/AC–N catalysts than for Ni/AC–A catalysts may be ascribed to a better reducibility of the nitrate as compared to the acetate precursor. For the higher nickel contents, the carbon frame surface area decreased and probably gave rise to new interactions with or encapsulation of the metal phase. Carbon deposit may also have occurred for all the catalysts during the reduction process and decreased the number of accessible nickel atoms [25]. It is worth to note that calculations show that the maximum hydrogen uptake is at most of 0.007wt% and is observed for 10%Ni/AC–N. This amount is negligible as compared to the hydrogen uptake at high pressures as shown below. 3.3 Heat treatments experiments The activated carbon alone or the catalysts were gradually heated under argon after a hydrogen treatment at 623K. Only hydrogen evolved at the outlet of the reactor. Hydrogen exhibits a main peak of desorption starting from 1000K for all the materials and a minor one at lower temperatures (around 760–780K) in the presence of the metal phase only. The high temperature peak is due to the heat decomposition of carbon functionalities without the help of the supported metal whereas the minor peak is ascribed to the action of the hydrogen molecules of the previous reduction treatment at 623K and retained on the catalyst [26]. For the low temperature peak, the amounts are maximum 326μmol g cat - 1 (Table 1). This is less than 0.1wt%. If one expresses the corresponding H/Ni (mol/mol) ratios, it could be seen that the hydrogen desorption process is influenced by the nature of the precursor and, to a greater extent, by the nickel content. The highest (3.2–3.83) and lowest (0.2–0.6) H/Ni ratios are obtained with the low (1%) and high (⩾5%) Ni percentage, respectively. This strikingly follows the decrease of the surface area or pore volume. Moreover, the H/Ni ratio for 1% Ni exceeds 1, the stoichiometric ratio expected if the hydrogen is totally adsorbed on the metal phase only. This indicates that part of the hydrogen, if not all, is strongly retained on the activated carbon support [26]. The hydrogen uptake or the H/Ni ratio varies in the same direction as the pore volume. 3.4 High-pressure hydrogen uptake studies at room temperature We have examined several factors influencing the hydrogen storage at room temperature on the Ni/AC catalysts or support: hydrogen pressure, nature of the nickel precursor or nickel content, pre-treatment temperature. The results obtained are reported in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 2 . In the absence of metal, the active carbon adsorbs small quantities of hydrogen: 0.1wt% at 20 bars (Fig. 2). This amount is not changed when the hydrogen pressure was increased to 30 bars. In contrast, in the presence of nickel, the amount of hydrogen stored sharply increases (Fig. 2). At 20 bars the hydrogen uptake is 0.29wt% for 1%Ni/AC–N, that is 3 times that of the pure active carbon. It increases to 0.53% at 30 bars. Another feature of the study is the decrease of the hydrogen uptake with the increase of the nickel content (Fig. 2): for example, it decreases from 0.53 to 0.48 or 0.40wt% when the nickel content increases from 1% to 5% or 10% in the case of the Ni/AC–N catalysts. The variation of the hydrogen uptake is more striking when it is expressed as the H/Ni ratio. Indeed, this ratio is of 23.4–30.9 and around 2.0 for 1%Ni and 10%Ni, respectively. It is much higher than 1 as a result of important incorporation of hydrogen on the support surface. Its variation is rather related to the carbon texture than to the metal dispersion. Indeed, the metal surface area of the nitrate catalysts is almost not changed whereas the specific area and pore volume dramatically decreases with the increase in the metal content (Table 1). The hydrogen uptake or the H/Ni ratio varies in the same direction as the pore volume. There is also no correlation of the hydrogen uptake with the metal dispersion for the Ni/AC–A catalysts but with the pore volume (Table 1). These catalysts are as active as the Ni/AC–N catalysts in the hydrogen storage at 20 bars, as shown in Fig. 2. However, in contrast, their capability decreases when the pressure of hydrogen increases to 30 bars. At this pressure and for the nickel content of 1%, the hydrogen uptake is of about 0.40% against 0.50% for the nitrate precursor catalyst. The kind of precursor influences the hydrogen uptake. The uptake is also influenced by the temperature of the pre-treatment as shown for the 1%Ni content catalysts. The results obtained show that the effect is significant at 30 bars, notably for the nitrate catalyst as reported in Table 2. The uptake decreases with increasing pre-treatment temperature under a hydrogen flow. The changes are best illustrated when the hydrogen uptake is expressed by the H/Ni ratio. For 1Ni/AC–N this ratio decreases from 31.0 to 26.3 or 19.7 when this temperature is increased from 623 to 773 or 873K. The total decrease is of 30%. The effect of mechanical mixture of the catalyst and support was studied with various AC/(AC+catalyst) percentages (wt%). The results for 1Ni/AC–A+AC mixtures are presented in Fig. 3 . The dilution of the catalyst by the support increases the H/Ni ratio for the prepared mixtures up to a maximum. This maximum (H/Ni=21) was found for the 1:4 mixture. Remarkably, for all the mixtures, the H/Ni ratio is ≫1. This strongly confirms the intervention of the support in the hydrogen uptake. At room temperatures, thermodynamic experiments and calculations showed that only at pressures of 50,000 bars, the H/Ni ratios will reach values closer to 1, which is where the phase transition of nickel hydride takes place [27,28]. This means that, under the most favorable experimental conditions we used, equilibrium H/M ratios in Ni will still be a quite small value (≪0.01). 4 Discussion The present results clearly show that nickel catalysts supported on amorphous activated carbon could significantly improves the hydrogen storage at room temperature as compared to the support, provided the pressure used is high enough to observe the phenomena. This hydrogen is desorbable under moderate conditions, namely room temperature and pressure. It should correspond to hydrogen species loosely chemisorbed to the material surface. Small amounts of hydrogen (<700ppm wt.) extractable at high temperatures were also evidenced. These results pose the problem of the location and mechanism of the adsorption of the hydrogen uptake for the materials used. The present results unambiguously show the central role of the metal in the hydrogen uptake for a metal-doped activated carbon. The uptake level is restricted by the pore volume level. In the presence of nickel, the pore volume decreases at high metal contents (5 or 10%Ni wt.). For a given nickel content the hydrogen uptake only slightly changes with the nature of the metal precursor because the specific area is almost not changed. The uptake change a little with the temperature of the pre-treatment as probably a result of structural changes in the carbon frame. The excess of hydrogen uptake by the catalysts (up to 0.53% wt.) as compared to that of the activated carbon (0.1wt%) can be attributed to a hydrogen adsorption process through a spillover mechanism [22,29], namely the dissociation of hydrogen on the metal phase then migration onto the support. The H atoms would be stabilized on the graphite lattice [14]. This mechanism works for all catalysts whatever the nature of the metal precursor, the metal content or the temperature of pre-treatment. This is confirmed by the study of the catalyst+active carbon mixtures. It was shown that the hydrogen uptake increases with the dilution to a maximum then decreases (Fig. 3). This is typically the behavior of the spiltover hydrogen species formed [29]. The hydrogen migration process is controlled by a distance factor. Dilution is believed to increase the number of H species stabilized by the active carbon by increasing the available surface area and, in the mean time, lowering the recombination rate of these species in molecular hydrogen. At a certain point, the additional surface area of the dilutent brings no further benefit to the hydrogen uptake. On the other hand, the spillover effect may be restricted by textural factors in the carbon skeleton: the migration of the H atoms is probably inhibited when the mouth of the pores is narrowed or blocked as in case of the 5 or 10%Ni catalysts. The hydrogen storage of these catalysts dramatically decreases with decreasing specific area and pore volume. This is not due to the decrease of the metal dispersion (Table 1). The H2-TPD study shows that residual hydrogen desorbs at high temperatures (750–780K). We above concluded that this hydrogen, at least partly, is located on and tightly bonded to the carbon support or at the metal-support interface. Moreover, it is generally believed that the high temperature hydrogen results from the reverse spillover process, that is the migration of H atoms from the support onto the metal phase where they recombine then desorb [29]. One may conclude that the hydrogen molecules desorbing at room temperature (Fig. 2) more likely result from the direct recombination of H atoms on the carbon surface. This supposes that the carbon acceptor sites would be of lower energy than the metal sites. The loose bonding between the H-spiltover species and the carbon surface allows a facile recombination in molecular hydrogen. Accordingly, a possible mechanism of hydrogen storage and desorption could be written as follows: H 2 ( g ) ⇔ M 2 H M ⇔ AC 2 H C ⇔ H 2 ( g ) where M and AC denote metal and carbon sites, respectively and HM and HC hydrogen atoms adsorbed on a metal or a carbon site, respectively. Interestingly, the amount of the hydrogen stored is parallel to the amount of the high temperature hydrogen (Tables 1 and 2). This could mean that the spiltover species play a more specific role in the hydrogen storage, probably a surface structural effect. Indeed, it has been emphasized that spiltover species may modify the electronic properties of an oxide support and create new sites for the adsorption of hydrogen molecules from the gas phase [30]. This could be the case of a carbon support. The corresponding mechanism of hydrogen storage and desorption would be written as follows: H 2 ( g ) ⇔ M 2 H M ⇔ AC 2 S C ⇔ H 2 ( g ) where SC are carbon sites created by the hydrogen spiltover species. The other symbols are similar to that described above. It is worth noting that spiltover hydrogen species linked to a carbon type support were found very active in catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Thus, in case of Pt/active carbon, a kinetic study showed that benzene would be substantially and directly hydrogenated to cyclohexane on the carbon support [31]. The comparison of the performances of the Ni/AC materials studied with that published in the literature is not obvious. In effect, the different materials and conditions of observation of the hydrogen uptake are a serious obstacle for this comparison. Nevertheless, selected literature data show that these performances are in fairly good accordance with previous studies in similar conditions (Table 3 ). The conditions of hydrogen uptake has not still been optimized for the Ni/AC catalysts. Calculations show that the amounts of hydrogen adsorbed at most represent 1% of monolayer (Table 3). Improvements in metal dispersion or use of higher pressure may improve the hydrogen storage. 5 Conclusion The present results clearly show that nickel catalysts supported on active carbon could store significant amounts of hydrogen at room temperature and high pressure (up to 0.53% at 30 bars against 0.1% for the activated carbon). These performances are in fairly good accordance with published results and may be improved in the near future. The study shows that the hydrogen storage depends on the metal precursor nature or metal content and on the temperature of the pre-treatment. Three main features arise from the results obtained. First, the hydrogen stored is loosely linked to the catalyst surface: the desorption is operated at room temperature and pressure. Second, the hydrogen spillover is mainly responsible of the formation of the hydrogen reservoir: e.g., the amounts of hydrogen stored increases by physically diluting the catalyst on the activated carbon. Third, the pore volume modulates the level of the hydrogen reservoir: the hydrogen reservoir volume decreases with decreasing pore volume. The discussion of the results shows that, at room temperature and high pressure, the hydrogen spiltover species are most probably stored on the activated carbon. The weak adsorption strength of these species allows an easy recombination and a direct desorption from the support at room pressure and temperature. Moreover, a close examination of the amounts of the hydrogen spiltover species incorporated in the catalyst, during the heat pre-treatment under a hydrogen flow at 623K, strongly suggests that these species may have created new acceptor sites on the carbon support. On these carbon sites, at room temperature and high pressure, the hydrogen directly adsorbs from the gas phase. The H-adspecies formed may easily desorb at room temperature and pressure. To summarize the hydrogen reservoir may originate from two sources: (i) hydrogen spiltover species adsorbed on the carbon support via the nickel phase; (ii) hydrogen species directly adsorbed from the gas phase onto carbon active sites generated by the H2 pre-treatment.
