D-lOll5 Berlin, Germany Received 15 January 1996; accepted 29 January 1996 Abstract Isotopic transient experiments in vacuum of the ammoxidation of toluene were carried out, applying the temporal-analysis-of-products reactor (TAP) using o~-(14NH4)z[(VO)3(P207)2] as catalyst and ISNH3-containing ammoxidation feed gas. The study revealed the participation of ammonium ions in the N-insertion step during benzonitrile formation. The benzonitrile formed during the ammoxidation pulses is composed of the 14N- and 15N-product. The share of the ~SN-benzonitrile increased with pulse number.

Introduction The heterogeneously catalyzed ammoxidation of methylaromatics and hetero- cyclic compounds to their corresponding nitriles is an industrially important reaction; the products are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of several dyestuffs, pesticides and pharmaceuticals (e.g. [1]). Recently, vanadium phos- phorus oxides (VPO) were found to be highly active and selective in the formation of substituted benzonitriles from their corresponding toluenes [2-4].

Martin et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) Ll I-L16 The catalysts were obtained by a structural transformation of VPO precursor compounds (e.g. a-VPO52 H20, /3-VPO5 and several V(IV)-containing VPO phases) under ammoxidation conditions, i.e., the precursors interact and react with the feed gas, generating ammonium ion-containing VPO phases. For example, VOHPO41/2 H20 is well-known as precursor compound for the formation of (VO)2P207, being the catalyst of the n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [e.g. [5]], but it is transformed under ammoxidation reaction condi- tions mainly to ot-(NH4)z[(VO)3(P207)2] [6]. The transformation produces also a XRD-amorphous vanadium-rich phase, probably a mixed valent vanadium oxide [6]. ot-(NH4)2[(VO)3(P207)2] is isostructural to a-Kz[(VO)3(P207)2] [6], having a tunnel structure that contains the cations [7]. Furthermore, it is known that ammonia reacts with (VO)2P207 catalysts in a redox process, generating nitrogen, water and an amorphous V(III)-containing material [8]. The redox process is not limited to the catalyst surface, but it also proceeds in deeper layers of the bulk up to a total destruction of the crystalline structure. A nucleophilic attack of ammonia (ammonolysis) and/or an hydroly- sis of V-O-P and/or P-O-P links generate Br0nsted acid sites, indicated by a significant increase of the intensity of the ammonium ion band during the IR spectroscopic followed interaction of (VO)zP207 and ammonia at elevated temperatures [8,9]. These ammonium ions and/or amido groups that could be formed by an ammonolysis were supposed to be involved into the N-insertion step in the toluene to benzonitrile reaction cycle, proceeding on VPO catalysts as revealed by IR spectroscopy and described in detail in Ref. [9]. The understanding of the reaction steps of the ammoxidation reaction is still under debate due to a different surface chemistry on catalysts of different composition or structures. Thus, the knowledge of N-insertion species/sites is not unambiguous always and the nature of these species and/or sites seem to depend on the used catalysts. Murakami et al. [10] and Niwa et al. [11] observed ammonium ions as surface species on V2Os/alumina used as catalyst, whereas Otamiri and Andersson [12] suggested V = NH as well as V-NHOH species on V20~, being the N-insertion species. Azimov et al. [13] used V/Sb/Bi/oxide catalysts and proposed also imido species. Busca et al. [14] showed by IR spectroscopy on V205 catalysts the reaction of intermediately formed benzalde- hyde and adsorbed ammonia (coordinatively bound), forming the nitrile. Mat- suura [15] proposed for the N-insertion step on (VO)2P207 the participation of ammonium ions (BrCnsted sites) as well as coordinatively bound ammonia (Lewis sites) due to a break of P-O-P links of the pyrophosphate units. Recently, Ramis et al. [16] reported on the appearance of amido groups during the interaction of VzOs/titania and ammonia at elevated temperatures. The present study deals with the role of ammonium ions as a potential source of N-insertion species in the toluene to benzonitrile formation mechanism on VPO catalysts. If ammonium ions are involved in the nitrile formation process, the benzonitrile obtained, using ~SN-ammonia-containing feed pulses and a A. Martin et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) L l l - L16 L I3 14N-ammonium ion-containing VPO catalyst (e.g. ff-(NH4)2[(VO)3(P207)2]) should contain a significant share of the ~4N-product. Furthermore, one should observe an increasing ~SN/~4N-benzonitrile ratio with rising pulse number. Therefore, in this communication results are reported of the interaction of 15N-ammonia and a synthesized ot-(14NH4)2[(VO)3(P2OT)2] catalyst during toluene ammoxidation in which a transient pulse technique in vacuum was applied, using the temporal-analysis-of-products reactor (TAP). 2. Experimental a-(14NH4)2[(VO)3(P207)2] was synthesized by heating a mixture of V205 (55 mmol), (NH4)2HPO4 (880 mmol) and a small amount of inoculating crystals at 598 K for 2.5 hours under air [17]. A light green powder was obtained after elution the as-synthesized material with distilled water and dried in air. The material was pelletized and applied as split after crushing (fraction 300-600 gm). The principle of the TAP reactor system has been described in detail elsewhere [18,19]. The operating conditions were as follows: ca. 10~5-1017 feed molecules per pulse (produced by high-speed beam valves) enter a microcat- alytic fixed-bed reactor (at 10-4 Pa) filled with 250 mg of the a- (14NH4)2[(VO)3(P207)2] catalyst packed between two layers of quartz sand. The response signals for the desorbed compounds at the reactor outlet were analyzed by a high time resolution quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Pulse experiments were interrupted by continuous flow regime to increase the amount of feed molecules, interacting with the catalyst. The following feed composition was applied: Toluene:~SNH3:O2= 1:4:6. Neon was used as dilution gas (Toluene:Ne = 1:29). The catalyst was heated (heating rate /3--20 K/rain) under high vacuum up to 793 K and kept for 1 hour at this temperature before carrying out the experiments. The QMS detection was performed in a multi-ion detection (MID) mode, i.e., the transient responses for ~aN-containing benzoni- trile (amu 103) and ~SN-containing benzonitrile (amu 104) were recorded simultaneously. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 1 depicts the transient formation of 14N/15N-benzonitrile (amu 103 and 104) as recorded by accumulating the response signals of 10 feed pulses. It should be noted here that JaN-benzonitrile possesses a M + 1 peak (amu 104) that amounts to 8.4% of the amu 103 (M) peak. Thus, 8.4% of the amu 103 peak area were substracted from the amu 104 peak area in calculating the 14N/15N- benzonitrile ratio. As shown in Fig. la almost only ~4N-benzonitrile was formed L 14 A.

Therefore, the detected amu 104 peak must be mainly attributed to the M + 1 peak of ~4N-benzonitrile. Fig. lb demonstrates a distinct increase in ainu 104 in a second pulse series after an intermediate continuous flow, reflecting now the formation of ]SN-benzonitrile to a greater extent. Ca. 22% of the formed benzonitrile contains 15N. A.

The calculated share of ~SN-benzonitrile in a third and a fourth experiment amounts to 43 and 64%, respectively. The result of the experiments proves the presence of ~4N-nitrogen in the reaction product. This indicates that ammonium ions should be involved in the N-insertion step during the ammoxidation of toluene on the applied a- (14NH4)2[(VO)3(P207)2] catalyst at least. In the beginning of the transient experiments ~4N-benzonitrile was exclusively formed because only HN-am- monium ions of the catalyst surface were available. This fact shows also a rather unlikely reaction of gas phase ammonia with the aromatic intermediates, i.e., a Rideal-Eley mechanism as proposed earlier by Andersson [20] for the interac- tion of ammonia and a 3-picoline intermediate should be excluded. After that, ammonium ion vacancies could be occupied by 15N-ammonia, forming 15N-am- monium ions. In addition, ~SN-ammonium ions were produced upon the interac- tion of JSN-ammonia of the feed with intermediately generated free OH sites of the catalyst (by break of V-O-P and/or P-O-P links [8]) and, hence, increasingly involved in the ammoxidation to produce ~SN-benzonitrile. Further- more, the production of ~4N-benzonitrile did not drop to zero immediately after some pulses as expected by the reaction of only surface HN-ammonium ions. Rather, the results reveal that not only surface ammonium ions react but also ammonium ions of deeper layers. Moreover, as pointed out recently also other VPO precursor materials or catalysts that interact and react with the ammoxidation feed are able to form ammonium ions [2,8,15]. These ammonium ions should also be able to intervene in the ammoxidation mechanism on VPO catalysts.
