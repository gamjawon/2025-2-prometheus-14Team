Graphical abstract The utilization of sustainable lignocellulosic biomass for the production of high-value products could potentially solve the intensive reliance on fossil fuels. 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), obtained from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation, is a significant precursor for biomass converted high-value chemicals. Nowadays, the rational design of pre-catalysts via electrochemical self-reconstruction provides an opportunity to design efficient catalysts for electrooxidation process. In this study, we developed a pre-catalyst consisting of nanoscale cubic NiFePBA anchored on Ni(OH)2. After electrochemical reconstruction, it demonstrated superior HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) performance. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical self-reconstruction process converts nanoscale cubic NiFePBA into nanosheeted metal oxyhydroxide, resulting in the formation of an oxygen defect-rich heterostructure with Ni(OH)2. This reconstruction process also enhance the electrochemically active surface area, thereby increasing the number of active sites. The combined effect of increased active sites and oxygen defects significantly enhances the HMF adsorption and the HMFOR activity. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveals that the reconstructed NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits accelerated reaction kinetics and reduced reaction potential during the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. The NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R catalyst exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high current density of 50 mA·cm–2 at a relatively low potential of 1.43 V vs. RHE. This performance is characterized by a remarkable 99.1 % conversion of HMF, 98.5 % selectivity for FDCA, and a Faradaic efficiency of 94.2 %. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high-performance HMFOR electrocatalysts.

In comparison to the traditional thermocatalytic oxidation approach, electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF presents several advantages, including reduced energy demands, milder operational conditions, and the elimination of the need for precious metal catalysts. Furthermore, the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) can be integrated with electrochemical CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution processes, thereby enhancing energy efficiency [7–10]. Typically, HMFOR occurs under conditions of elevated anodic oxidation potentials and highly alkaline environments, which often lead to structural and compositional changes in many catalysts. Thus, it presents a significant challenge in the catalytic design for electrooxidation of HMF. Recent studies have identified pre-catalysts that undergo self-reconstruction as a highly effective electrocatalysts [11,12], providing a promising opportunity to design efficient catalysts for electrooxidation process. The materials before reconstruction are considered merely as “pre-catalysts”, and those have reconstructed are deemed “true catalysts”. This distinction arises because reconstructed materials demonstrated enhanced performance relative to catalysts synthesized through conventional methods [13,14]. A Prussian Blue Analogue (PBA) is composed of functional organic ligands and metal centers/clusters. Its unique structure provides the metal centers with high tunability, enabling them to offer active sites in electrochemical reactions. In PBA materials, cyanide (CN–) coordinates with metal ions, allowing ions to exchange within the material, which results in good conductivity. PBAs are widely applied in fields such as electrochemical catalysis and energy storage. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized a NiCoPBA pre-catalyst, which was successfully transformed into Ni(OH)2 through a reconstruction process in an alkaline medium, leading to the formation of abundant cationic defects, which underwent deprotonation and rapidly converted into a NiOOH substance [15]. Similarly, Fan and co-workers developed cuprous sulfide nanosheets (Cu2S NSs) as pre-catalysts, which were subsequently transformed into copper oxide nanorods (CuO-SO2 NRs) through a reconstruction process [16]. Wu and Yang have proposed a self-limiting surface reconstruction technique to synthesize a NiOOH layer on NiMo3S4. This process has been shown to potentially induce self-modification of Mo atoms and sulfate oxygen anions within the NiOOH matrix [17]. Therefore, the strategic design of pre-catalysts emerges as a promising approach for achieving efficient HMFOR. Nonetheless, fully leveraging reconstruction to develop superior HMFOR electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst through electro-deposition and anion exchange techniques, serves as a model “pre-catalyst”, which undergoes a self-reconstruction process following an electrochemical activation, resulting in formation of numerous oxygen defects and active sites. As expected, the reconstructed NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R (where R denotes reconstruction) exhibits remarkable HMFOR activity, requiring only 1.35 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA·cm−2. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the oxidation products reveals a remarkable HMF conversion of 99.1 %, with a selectivity to FDCA of 98.5 % and a Faradaic efficiency of 94.2 %. Notably, the catalytic performance remained nearly constant after five cycles. This study substantially enhances our understanding of the impact of self-reconstruction catalysts on HMFOR performance and provides rational design strategy for electrooxidation catalyst. 2 Experiments and methods 2.1 Material synthesis Synthesis of Ni(OH)2: Firstly, the nickel foam substrate (NF, 20 mm × 25 mm) was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in acetone, 1.5 M hydrochloric acid solution, and deionized water (DI water) for 15 min each. Following this, the obtained nickel foam (NF), platinum foil, and Ag/AgCl were employed as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Then the Ni(OH)2 was subsequently deposited onto the NF by applying a potential of −1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 600 s in a 0.15 M solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O prepared with DI water. The obtained Ni(OH)2/NF sample was then washed with DI water and dried at a temperature of 60 °C overnight. The synthesis of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 was conducted via ion-exchange method, by immersing Ni(OH)2/NF in a 30 mmol K3[Fe(CN)6] solution at ambient temperature for a duration of 4 days. Subsequently, the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 was extracted, thoroughly rinsed with DI water, and subjected to drying at 60 °C. 2.2 Characterization methods The chemical composition of the prepared materials was analyzed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a Cu Kα radiation source. Raman spectroscopy was carried out using an InVia spectrometer from Renishaw, UK, equipped with a 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted utilizing a ThermoFisherScientific K-Alpha model spectrometer to determine the elemental valence states and elemental composition of the synthesized materials. The binding energy calibration was performed using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as a reference standard. The morphology, structural characteristics, and elemental distribution of the synthesized materials were examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6610LV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30). Elemental contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Thermo Scientific iCAP PRO X). 2.3 Electrochemical experiments All electrochemical experiments were performed at ambient temperature using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The experimental setup employed a three-electrode configuration, consisting of a working electrode (NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R), a counter electrode (Pt foil), and a reference electrode (Hg/HgO), all housed within an H-type cell. The self-reconstruction process was evaluated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, conducted over a potential range of 1.4 to 1.8 V for 3000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1. Polarization curves were acquired at room temperature using linear sweep voltammetry, covering a potential range from 1.0 to 1.9 V at a scan rate of 5 mV·s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed employing a three-electrode setup, scanning a frequency range from 104 to 10−1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the Nernst equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + 0.095 V + 0.059 × pH. The current density for each electrode during the polarization studies of HMF oxidation was normalized based on the calculated electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values. The specific capacitance was determined to be 60 μF·cm−2, and the ECSA of the catalyst was calculated using the equation: E C S A ( c m 2 ) = C d l ( m F ) C s ( m F / c m 2 ) × 100 % 2.4 Products analysis The product was subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1260 system equipped with a 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm Supersil AQ-C18 column and a UV–visible detector. Specifically, a volume of 100 µL was extracted from the working electrode compartment of the H-type cell and subsequently diluted with DI water to achieve a final volume of 5 mL. The eluent was composed of 70 % ammonium formate and 30 % methanol, with a flow rate maintained at 0.6 mL·min−1. The UV detector was calibrated to a wavelength of 265 nm. Quantitative analysis of the product was performed by utilizing the external standard method. Conversion, selectivity, and Faraday efficiency were calculated as follows: H M F c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = m o l o f H M F c o n s u m e d m o l o f i n i t i a l H M F × 100 % F D C A y i e l d ( % ) = m o l o f F D C A f o r m e d m o l o f i n i t i a l H M F × 100 % F a r a d a i c e f f i c i e n c y ( % ) = m o l o f F D C A f o r m e d × F × 6 t o t a l c h a r g e p a s s e d × 100 % C a r b o n b a l a n c e ( % ) = m o l o f s u m o f o r g a n i c m a t t e r a f t e r t h e r e a c t i o n m o l o f i n i t i a l H M F × 100 % where F represents the Faraday constant (96,485 C·mol−1). 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Catalysts characterization analysis Fig. 1 a presents a schematic representation of the synthesis and subsequent reconstruction of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2. Initially, Ni(OH)2 was synthesized via electrochemical deposition onto a three-dimensional macroporous conductive Ni foam (NF) substrate. The deposited Ni(OH)2 manifested as irregular nanoparticles and nanosheets ( Fig. S1 a). Subsequently, NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 was produced through an anion exchange method. In this process, free Ni2+ ions interact with [Fe(CN)6]3−, leading to the formation of regular nanocubes of Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 (referred to as NiFePBA) on the Ni(OH)2 surface. The specific equations governing the process are as follows: Ni(OH)2 → Ni2+ + 2OH–, 3Ni2+ + 2Fe(CN)6 3−→ Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 (NiFePBA). Notably, the synthesized nanocubes exhibited an average particle size ranging from 140 to 160 nm, which is much smaller than that of Prussian Blue catalysts prepared via hydrothermal methods, which typically exceed 500 nm [18,19]. This size discrepancy can be attributed to the gradual release of Ni2+ ions, which impedes the crystal growth of NiFePBA. Literature reports suggest that smaller particle sizes enhance the contact surface area between the electrode and the electrolyte, thereby accelerating the rate of reconstruction [20]. Figs. 1 b and S1 b present the SEM and TEM images of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2, which clearly demonstrate that the NiFePBA nanocubes are well adhered to Ni(OH)2. As depicted in Fig. 1 c , the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images reveal the heterojunction region of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2, indicating the presence of two distinct phases on either side of the interface. The lattice fringes in the upper region exhibit spacings of 0.199 nm and 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (0 1 2) and (0 1 5) interplanar spacings of Ni(OH)2, respectively. In contrast, the lattice fringes in the lower region display spacings of 0.244 nm, which align with the (4 2 2) interplanar spacing of NiFePBA. The Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of Ni, Fe, O, and N elements, as depicted in Fig. 1 d . These results suggest that the NiFePBA nanocubes have been successfully anchored onto the Ni(OH)2 substrate. Fig. S1 c shows the SEM images of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R, which exhibits microspheres characteristic of NiOOH. Furthermore, the TEM image of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R (Fig. 1 e ) provides a more detailed depiction of the morphological transformation of the cubic NiFePBA. As illustrated in Fig. 1 f , HRTEM images of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R electrodes demonstrate the retention of a heterogeneous structure. The lattice in the right region exhibits planar spacing of 0.229 nm and 0.205 nm, which correspond to the (1 0 4) and (101) planes of NiOOH. In contrast, the left region displays lattice fringes with planar intervals of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (0 1 5) planes of Ni(OH)2. The EDS mapping of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R reveals a uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, O, and N elements, as depicted in Fig. 1 g. To further elucidate the impact of material reconstruction on elemental composition, detailed analyses were conducted using combination characterization of EDS analysis and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). ICP-OES results ( Table S1 ) exhibit that the Ni/Fe ratio of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 was 1.35:1. After reconstruction, this ratio in NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R altered to 15:1, aligning closely with the EDS analysis results ( Figs. S2 and S3 ). These observations suggest that the reconstruction process facilitated the migration and loss of Fe and CN groups, accompanied by an increasing of the Ni and O content. This alteration is likely associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies and the active metal oxyhydroxide NiOOH. To investigate the reconstruction mechanism of the catalyst, LSV curves of the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 samples with different activation cycles (0, 500, 1500, and 3000 cycles) were initially measured ( Fig. S4 ). The results indicate that the current density of the samples increases gradually with the number of activation cycles. Subsequently, we performed physical characterization on the electrodes with different activation cycles (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6-7 ). Fig. 2 a presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of various materials. The characteristic peaks observed at 33.4°, 38.7°, and 60.0° are attributed to the (1 0 1), (0 1 5), and (1 1 0) planes of α-Ni(OH)2, as referenced by PDF # 38–0715 [21,22]. It is noteworthy that Ni(OH)2 exists in two polymorphic forms, with α-Ni(OH)2 exhibiting superior electrochemical performance compared to β-Ni(OH)2 [23–25]. Additionally, the characteristic peaks at 17.7°, 25.1°, and 35.8° in the XRD spectrum of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 are associated with the (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (4 0 0) planes of NiFePBA, according to PDF # 75–0037. This confirms the presence of both α-Ni(OH)2 and NiFePBA, thereby verifying the successful synthesis of the target sample [26]. Furthermore, the XRD spectrum of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R (the sample after 3000 activation cycles) closely resembles that of Ni(OH)2, suggesting that the structure of NiFePBA may be transformed after reconstruction. Figs. 2 b and S5 present the Raman spectra for various samples. Following the anion exchange reaction on Ni(OH)2, distinct peaks at 2098, 2136, and 2185 cm−1 were observed, indicative of the vibrations of the −C≡N− group in NiFePBA. The notable disappearance of these three peaks after reconstruction indicates the removal of the [Fe(CN)6]3− groups. The emergence of new peaks at 470 and 562 cm−1 subsequent to the reconstruction suggests the presence of FeNi−OOH and FeNi−O, respectively [27]. Figs. 2 c-f and S6 show the XPS spectra of the samples with different activation cycles. Fig. 2 c and Fig. S6 a illustrate the Ni 2p spectra of the samples, revealing three distinct sets of peaks. Satellite peaks are identified at 861.6 and 879.9 eV, while Ni2+ peaks appear at 856.0 and 873.6 eV, and Ni3+ peaks are observed at 857.4 and 875.5 eV, respectively. With the increase in the number of activation cycles, the content of high valent nickel in the samples gradually increases. Notably, the signal intensity for Ni3+ species at 857.4 and 875.5 eV exhibits a significant increase after reconstruction, suggesting an elevated concentration of NiOOH species. Fig. 2 d and Fig. S6 b presents the Fe 2p spectra, where the Fe3+/Fe2+ percentage of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R (53.3 %: 46.7 %) is quite higher than that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 (19 %: 81 %), which is ascribed to the generation of FeOOH substances [28–30]. The presence of high-valent metal ions within the heterostructure enhances the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates under alkaline conditions, expedites charge transfer kinetics, and promotes the rapid formation of metal hydroxide oxides [31]. As depicted in Fig. 2 e and Fig. S6 c, the O 1s spectra of the samples reveal three distinct peaks at 530.8, 531.7, and 532.85 eV, which correspond to oxygen atoms bound to metals (O1), defect sites with low oxygen coordination (O2), and hydroxyl species or surface-adsorbed oxygen (O3), respectively [32–35]. Table S2 presents the calculated proportions of oxygen species in various catalysts after different electrochemical active cycles. It is evident that the content of oxygen defects (O2) shows a progressive increase from 35.2 % to 52.7 % from the initial state to after 3000 cycles (NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R). This increase in oxygen vacancies enhances the electron density and the number of active sites around the Ni center, thereby improving the material's adsorption capacity for HMF and its catalytic activity towards HMFOR [36]. Additionally, Fig. 2 f and Fig. S6 d presents a comparative analysis of the N 1s spectra for the samples before and after reconstruction. The inconspicuous peak of the N element in the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R sample confirms the elimination of [Fe(CN)6]3− groups subsequent to reconstruction, which is consistent with the results obtained from Raman spectroscopy. The findings presented above indicate that the reconstruction of the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 material results in alternations to both its composition and structure: (1) The [Fe(CN)6]3− groups are removed, accompanied by the leaching of some high-valent metal ions, (2) The NiFePBA is transformed into corresponding metal oxyhydroxides, potentially serving as the active component to enhance HMFOR, and (3) The reconstructed sample exhibits by a high concentration of oxygen vacancies. 3.2 Electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF and EIS analysis The catalytic performance for HMFOR was assessed utilizing a three-electrode setup within an H-type cell. Fig. 3 a depicts the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for both NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 and NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R in a solution of 1.0 M KOH and 10 mM HMF. In the absence of HMF, the LSV curve for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 reaches a peak at 1.50 V, signifying the oxidation of Ni2+ to form high-valent Ni3+ species at this potential. The observed increase in current density beyond 1.58 V is attributed to the onset of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Upon the addition of 10 mmol of HMF to the electrolyte, the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R electrode achieves a current density of 50 mA·cm−1 at a potential of 1.43 V, demonstrating a significantly enhanced performance compared to the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 electrode, which requires 1.47 V. The results suggest that HMFOR exhibits a lower oxidation potential compared to OER, while NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R demonstrates superior efficiency for HMFOR relative to NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2. This improved performance is ascribed to the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies and the exposure of a large number of active sites as a result of the reconstruction process. The LSV plots presented in Fig. 3 b illustrate the performance of four catalysts under 10 mM HMF conditions. Notably, NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits superior HMFOR activity compared to Ni(OH)2, NiFePBA, and NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2. Furthermore, the current density and FE of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R at 1.47 V is significantly higher than that of the other materials (Fig. 3 c ). As shown in Fig. 3 d , we analyzed steady-state current–potential data from CA to compare Tafel slopes between control samples ( Fig. S7 ). The Tafel slopes for HMFOR of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R measured at 275 mV·dec−1, which are lower than those observed for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 (285 mV·dec−1), NiFePBA (332 mV·dec−1), and Ni(OH)2 (365 mV·dec−1). This indicates superior electron transfer kinetics at the interface between HMF molecules and NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R, thereby significantly enhancing the electrocatalyst activity [37]. Additionally, the electrochemical surface area was evaluated by determining the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) using cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates ( Fig. S8 ). As depicted in Fig. 3 e , the Cdl of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R is the highest, measuring 2.73 mF·cm−2, followed by Ni(OH)2 at 1.95 mF·cm−2, NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 at 1.83 mF·cm−2, NiFePBA and at 1.33 mF·cm−2. This indicates that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R possesses the highest electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), suggesting enhanced exposure of active sites. In addition, we normalized the material current density by ECSA to investigate whether the apparent enhancement of the activity of the material was intrinsic or mainly due to the increase of surface active sites. According to the results of Fig. S9 , after ECSA normalization, the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R sample does not exhibit the highest current density among the tested samples. This suggests that the observed enhancement in activity is primarily due to an increase in electrochemically active surface sites. This increase may result from structural changes induced by reconstruction, which expand the surface area and expose more active sites, thereby boosting the current density of the material. Fig. 3 f illustrates the variation in open-circuit potential (OCP) of the Helmholtz layer absorber, which was analyzed to assess the adsorption behavior of HMF on the catalyst. The adsorption of HMF on the electrode surface enhances the accumulation of surface charge, hence influencing the potential difference between the electrode and the electrolyte. A greater drop in OCP indicates a larger adsorption capacity of HMF on the electrode surface. Upon introduction of 50 mM HMF into the electrolyte, the decrease of OCP for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R is 81 mV, which is remarkably larger than that of 29 mV for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2, 24 mV for Ni(OH)2, and 28 mV for NiFePBA, suggesting that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits enhanced surface adsorption properties towards substrate HMF. This enhanced adsorption capacity is attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies. Chronoamperometric electrolysis of HMF was conducted within an H-type cell (refer to Fig. S10 ). Fig. S11 illustrates the relationship between current density, power consumption, and time during the HMFOR process, showing that with increasing time and charge, the current density progressively diminishes as a result of HMF consumption. When the reaction reaches the end and HMF is nearly completely consumed, the current density drops below 10 mA·cm−2. Fig. S12 presents data on HMF conversion, FDCA yield, and faradaic efficiency (FE) at various applied voltages for the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R. Higher conversion of HMF and yield of FDCA are achieved at potentials of 1.47 V and below, with the optimum performance observed at 1.47 V. Beyond this potential, the OER competes with the HMFOR, resulting in reduced conversion and yield. Fig. S13 and S14 demonstrates the HMF conversion, FDCA yield, faradaic efficiency (FE) and Carbon balance of Ni(OH)2 and NiFePBA materials at different voltages. The electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA can proceed via two distinct pathways due to the presence of hydroxyl and aldehyde functional groups on HMF (Fig. 4 a ). Specifically, the aldehyde group can be selectively oxidized to produce 5-hydroxymethylfurfural-2-carboxylic acid (HMFCA), while the hydroxyl group can be oxidized to yield 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). These two intermediates undergo further oxidation to yield 5-formyl-2-furoic Acid (FFCA) and ultimately FDCA. As illustrated in Fig. 4 b , the electrocatalytic HMFOR activity of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R was initially assessed at a potential of 1.47 V. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to collect the resulting electrolytes at regular intervals, enabling a quantitative evaluation of the concentrations of HMF and its oxidation products. Fig. S15 and S16 present the retention times of HMF and its oxidation products in liquid chromatography, along with the standard calibration curves. In the H-type cell, complete oxidization of HMF is achieved after surpassing 180 C, resulting in an FDCA yield of up to 98.5 %. The final electrolyte solution is rendered colorless, contrasting with the initial yellow hue of the HMF solution. Fig. 4 c depicts the variations in the concentrations of HMF and its oxidized intermediates/products at different charge levels. The NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R catalyst exhibits a conversion of 99.1 %, selectivity of 98.5 %, and FE of 94.2 %, demonstrating superior HMFOR electrocatalytic activity compared to other reported Ni-based and Co-based catalysts ( Table S3 ). As shown in Fig. 4 d , the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R catalyst demonstrates exceptional durability, as evidenced by the absence of significant reductions in conversion, yield, and FE after five consecutive electrolysis cycles. Furthermore, the material still exhibits excellent stability in the chronopotentiometry experiment and preparation reproducibility tests ( Fig. S17 and Table S4 ). To further investigate the reasons behind its remarkable performance, we conducted kinetic studies by monitoring the changes in reactant concentration over time. The analysis revealed a linear relationship between ln(C0/C) and reaction time (t), indicating that the oxidation of HMF follows a first-order reaction mechanism ( Fig. S18 a-c). Therefore, the reaction rate constant can be used to quantitatively describe the reaction kinetics. All experiments were performed at a constant potential of 1.47 V. As shown in Fig. S18 d, we found that the reaction rate constants for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R are higher than those for NiFePBA and Ni(OH)2 in all three reactants. This indicates that the reaction kinetics of the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R are faster. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) serves as a valuable technique for examining the electrical properties of electrochemical systems, enabling the investigation of the relationship between HMFOR activity and catalytic kinetics. The equivalent circuit model can be elucidated through the analysis of Nyquist plots ( Fig. S19 ). R S denotes the solution resistance, while CPE1 and CPE2 represent the double-layer capacitance and dielectric properties, respectively. The symbols R ct and R p correspond to the interfacial charge transfer resistance, and the resistance of the electrode film, respectively [38]. Fig. 5 a presents a comparison of the Nyquist plots for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R, NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2, NiFePBA, and Ni(OH)2 at a potential of 1.35 V. It is evident that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance compared to the other three materials, suggesting that the exposure of more metal oxyhydroxide active sites during the self-reconstruction process enhances charge transfer kinetics [39]. It is noteworthy that the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R system with the presence of 50 mM HMF demonstrates a lower charge transfer resistance compared to the system without HMF at a potential of 1.35 V, indicating enhanced catalytic performance in the HMFOR (illustrated in Fig. 5 b ). To further elucidate the interfacial kinetics, electron transfer, and mass transfer relationships in electrochemical reactions at varying potentials, in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. This approach was utilized to explore these interactions and elucidate the structure–activity relationship, as depicted in Figs. 5 c, d, and S20 . Fig. 5 c and 5d present the Bode phase diagrams of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R in 1 M KOH, both in the presence and absence of HMF. The low-frequency region (10−1–101 Hz) corresponds to the non-uniform charge distribution resulting from oxide formation on the electrode surface [40,41], whereas the high-frequency region (101–105 Hz) is associated with oxidation processes occurring within the electrode. As depicted in Fig. 5 c, a distinct transition peak emerges in the low-frequency region at 1.50 V, signifying that OER occurs at potentials exceeding 1.5 V. This observation is consistent with the LSV curve for OER of NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R. Upon the introduction of 50 mM HMF, this initial peak remains observable. Significantly, a novel transition peak emerges at 1.3 V, indicating that HMFOR occurs at 1.3 V, with a range from 1.3 V to 1.5 V (illustrated in Fig. 5 d ). This observation aligns with the LSV curve (with HMF) for NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the phase plots with those of the other three materials ( Fig. S20 ) reveals that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits the smallest phase angle in the low-frequency regions within the potential range where HMFOR occurs. This finding indicates that the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R electrocatalyst possesses superior kinetics for HMFOR. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a Prussian blue analog pre-catalyst (NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2) utilizing a straightforward electro-deposition and anion exchange technique. Then the pre-catalyst undergoes self-reconstruction to produce NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R, which has an alteration in its chemical composition and structure. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that after undergoing a self-reconstruction process, the NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exposes more active sites and the O 1s XPS spectra provide direct evidence that the self-reconstruction leads to an increase in oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity of HMFOR. The results of in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R has faster reaction kinetics and lower reaction potentials in HMFOR. Kinetic experiments indicate that the heterogeneous structure of the material promotes the reaction rate of HMFOR. Ultimately, the reconstructed NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2 (denoted as NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R) demonstrates remarkable HMFOR performance, achieving a conversion rate of 99.1 %, selectivity of 98.5 %, and a Faradaic efficiency of 94.2 %. This study explores a pre-catalyst for HMFOR capable of self-reconstruction, offering significant insights for the design of pre-catalysts aimed at enhancing value-added biomass conversion.

        "dc:description": "The utilization of sustainable lignocellulosic biomass for the production of high-value products could potentially solve the intensive reliance on fossil fuels. 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), obtained from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation, is a significant precursor for biomass converted high-value chemicals. Nowadays, the rational design of pre-catalysts via electrochemical self-reconstruction provides an opportunity to design efficient catalysts for electrooxidation process. In this study, we developed a pre-catalyst consisting of nanoscale cubic NiFePBA anchored on Ni(OH)2. After electrochemical reconstruction, it demonstrated superior HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) performance. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical self-reconstruction process converts nanoscale cubic NiFePBA into nanosheeted metal oxyhydroxide, resulting in the formation of an oxygen defect-rich heterostructure with Ni(OH)2. This reconstruction process also enhance the electrochemically active surface area, thereby increasing the number of active sites. The combined effect of increased active sites and oxygen defects significantly enhances the HMF adsorption and the HMFOR activity. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveals that the reconstructed NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R exhibits accelerated reaction kinetics and reduced reaction potential during the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF. The NiFePBA/Ni(OH)2-R catalyst exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high current density of 50 mA·cm–2 at a relatively low potential of 1.43 V vs. RHE. This performance is characterized by a remarkable 99.1 % conversion of HMF, 98.5 % selectivity for FDCA, and a Faradaic efficiency of 94.2 %. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high-performance HMFOR electrocatalysts.",
