Bond * , Joop C. Slaa Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge. UBS 3PH. UK Received 14 May 1995; accepted 23 August 1995 Abstract The addition of Ge as Ge\"Bu4 to H-covered Ru/A1203 (RuECI) leads after in situ reduction at high temperature (HTR1; 758 K) to decreases in HZ chemisorption capacity and even more marked falls in activity for hydrogenolysis of propane and of n-butane. Changes in product selectivities are slight, and all Ge-containing samples exhibit similar characteristics to the parent RuECI, which is very highly dispersed. Although loss of activity is chiefly due to encapsulation of the Ruo particles by amorphous GeO,, species, these affect neighbouring active sites by decreasing the equilibrium constant for alkane dehydrogenation to the reactive species. This conclusion follows from determinations of the rate-dependence on Hz pressure and mathematical modelling of the results. Similar behaviour is shown by the less well-dispersed RuEC3, where activity loss and selectivity changes are partly due to encapsulation by GeOx of smaller particles: some evidence for selective blocking of Ru atoms in low coordination number sites by Sn species formed analogously is however obtained. H2 pressure-dependence of the rate of n-butane hydrogolysis was determined at four different temperatures with a GeOx modified RuEC3, whence a true activation energy (50 kJ mol-') and an enthalpy change for the alkane dehydrogenation step were obtained. Oxidation and low-temperature reduction (O/LTR) of catalysts previously subjected to HTRI led to very large increases in rate, and to changes in product selectivites, that suggested the creation of large, essentially pure, Ru particles; the modifier could not be wholly re-united with them by a second HTR. Ru/A1203 catalysts of the NI series, prepared from inorganic precursors, showed greater dispersion in the presence of the modifier, the catalytic behaviour being in harmony with this observation.

All rights reserved SSD11381-1169(95)00245-6 supported Ru catalysts, to some of which an element of Group 14 (Ge, Sn or Pb) had been either added subsequently or had been incorporated as a compound in the preparation [1]. We have already reported the effects on rates of alkane hydrogenolysis of various pretreatments to the pure Ru catalysts [2] and on the kinetics of hydrogenolysis of the lower alkanes on some 136 G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 of these catalysts [3]; other colleagues have described the hydrogenolysis of 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane on pure Ru catalysts and some of their bimetallic counterparts [4]. This paper concerns the hydrogenolysis of propane and of n-butane on bimetallic Ru catalysts; with these simpler alkanes it may be possible to understand more fully how the modifying element changes the structure of the active centre. We also now have the benefit of further EXAFS measurements [5] to aid the interpretation of our results. The theoretical basis of these studies has been developed in earlier publications [1,6]. Briefly it is believed, from the products of hydrogenolysing 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane, which are either isobutane or methane + 2,2,3trimethylbutane, that on Ru particles of a sufficient size Ge atoms formed from a tetra-alkylgermane are randomly distributed over the metal surface, showing no preference for any particular class of surface site: the average size of Ru atom ensembles therefore becomes smaller. The larger atoms of Sn and Pb, formed analogously, seem however to show a preference for blocking sites containing Ru atoms of low coordination number, such as may be found at edges and corners, as the resulting catalytic behaviour simulates that of large particles [6] on which larger active centres comprising high coordination number atoms may be found. The validity of these models has been confirmed by quantum chemical calculations [7]. The purpose of the present work was to see whether the hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes responded similarly to the presumed differences in surface structure produced by the modifying atoms. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The chemical and physical properties of the catalysts principally used in this work have been described in detail in an earlier publication [ 1 ]: the quantities that are needful to know in order to understand the results reported here are reproduced for convenience in Table 1. Briefly, the RuEC series was prepared using Ru(acac)3, and the Group 14 element was added by reaction of a tetra-alkyl compound with the reduced Ru/A1203. RuNIl was made with Ru(NO)(N03)3, and the modified versions by co-impregnation with a solution containing this salt and a salt of the Group 14 element. The RuAB37 series had been prepared at Montpellier some time ago, by essentially the same method as that used for the RuEC series; their characteristics and behaviour in catalysed reactions of alkanes have been described before [6,8]. The (H/Ru)tot value for RuAB37 is 0.91 [2] and, on the basis that (H/Ru)tot is 1.28 0.09 times (H/Ru);m [2], the corresponding values for the modified catalysts are as shown in Table 1.

G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 2.2. Pretreatment and reaction conditions Each sample of catalyst was first reduced in flowing H2 (40 cm 3 min-1) for 13 h at 753 K (HTR1). In certain cases the stability of the modified catalysts under the oxidising conditions used previously [2] was examined by applying (to the same sample as that used to test activity after HTR1) an oxidation (air, 623 K, 1 h) followed by reduction overnight at 433 K (O/LTR). Further, after activity testing, the same sample was again reduced overnight at 753 K (HTR2), and its behaviour studied. Further details of the procedure used were provided earlier [2]. Reactions were conducted in a continuous-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Two types of experiment are reported. (1) In thermal cycling the temperature was raised in steps of about 10 K over at least 100 K, a sample being removed for analysis towards the end of each 20 min isothermal period (stage 1), the temperature then being lowered back to the starting temperature in similar steps (stage 2) [2]. (2) For determination of the isothermal H 2 kinetics, the reaction pulse method [3] was used, in which known flows of H2, alkane and N2 were passed over the catalyst for only 1 min, towards the end of which time a sample was taken for analysis: the alkane flow was then stopped, and the H2-N2 mixture then passed for 19 min in order to restore the surface. Various H 2 concentrations ( - 0.02-0.8 atm) were obtained by altering the H 2 flow-rate, and the N2 flow-rate sympathetically in order to keep the total flow constant; they were changed randomly, and standard values (usually H2: alkane 137 = 10:1) were interposed frequently to check for deactivation. Corrected rates were obtained by interpolation as described before [3]; they are expressed as mmol alkane reacted per g Ru per h. 2.3. Treatment of results Product selectivities are given as the number of molecules of product formed for each alkane molecule reacted: thus for propane S,+2S2=3 and for n-butane SI +2S2+3S3=4 It is unnecessary to cite values of S,. Application of the Kempling-Anderson formalism [2,3] converts these molar selectivities into selectivity parameters, which for n-butane comprise F (defining the probability of central bond fission), and T2 and T, which give the chances that adsorbed C2 and C3 species respectively will be converted into gaseous ethane or propane, rather than suffer further cracking. The equations that relate selectivities to these parameters are (S2/T2)+S3= 1 +F S3/(1 -F) = T, cannot be solved, so it is necessary to assume that T2 is the value of S2 found in the reaction of propane under the corresponding conditions. Alternatively, where the propane reaction has not been performed, we assume T2 to be unity (an approximate but not precise assumption): values of F and T3 so derived are denoted by primes, and are italicised in the table of results.

Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 A full description of the modelling procedure and its underlying philosophy has been given previously [3]; the reaction scheme and the derived rate expression ES5B are shown in Scheme 1. 3. Results 3.1. Effects of the modifying element on HZ chemisorption H2 chemisorption isotherms have been measured for all catalysts used in this work, and the results published [1]; we have also explained [2] our reasons for preferring to use the total amount adsorbed, viz. (H/Ru)tot, rather than the amount irreversibly adsorbed, as a means of estimating the free Ru surface. Semi-quantitative comments on particle size distributions as observed by TEM have also been made [ 1 ]. The chief purpose of these measurements is to count the number of uncovered Ru atoms and hence to estimate turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the catalysed reactions per surface Ru atom Ru, We do not know a priori the efficiency with which the modifiers mask the surface of the Ru particles [9], and so the values of (H/Ru)tot must be used to give this information. There are however a number of possible complications that need to be noted; these include (i) the slow attainment of equilibrium [ 1 ], (ii) possible interference by impurities (e.g. Cl [10], C), (iii) the compound nature of the chemisorbed state of H [ 11 ], (iv) the lack of certain knowledge of the H: Rus stoichiometry, especially at high dispersion, and (v) the unknown influence of the modifier, including the possibility of spillover onto it. Even in the absence of a modifier, it is meaningless to use the results of H2 chemisorption to estimate a mean particle size when there is evidence (as there is from TEM in a number of cases [1]) of bimodal particle size distributions. Equally one cannot use (H/Ru)tot values in the presence of a modifier to estimate mean size, even if there is no suggestion from TEM of bimodality. Notwithstanding all these uncertainties, we propose to use (H/Ru),o, measurements to give the number of free Rus atoms, and to interpret derived conclusions with appropriate caution. With the RuECl series, (H/Ru),ot falls as the Ge concentration is increased, but less than proportionately (Table 1 and Fig. 1), while at approximately equal surface concentrations of modifier Sn is more, and Pb is less, effective than Ge in lowering (H/Ru)to, (Fig. 1). Each Ge atom therefore initially prevents the chemisorption of about 1.5H atoms, although subsequent additions are less effective. Each Sn atom blocks about two H atoms, and each Pb atom about one. The less well dispersed RuEC3 [1] behaves differently (Table 1), each Ge atom blocking only about one H atom, while each Sn atom is somewhat less effective. The same trend is also seen with the apparently well dispersed RuAB37 [6] (Table 1 and Fig. 1), where each Ge atom initially stops the chemisorption of about two H atoms. 3.2. Effects of modifiers on hydrogenolysis rates and selectivity parameters at constant temperature Hydrogenolysis rates for both n-butane at 433 K (Table 2) and for propane at 473 K (Table 3) are suppressed as the, Ge concentration in the RuECl series is increased, much more quickly than the (H/Ru),ot decreases. Thus the TOFs also decrease, in the manner shown in Fig. 2, where the values relative to that for the unmodified RuECI are used. The selectivity parameters F and T3 both decrease with increasing Ge concentration (Table 2) and thus also with (H/Ru)~o. (Fig. 3): the effect is however only marked with RuEC 1 Ge3. There are only very slight changes in S2 for the propane reaction (Table 3). The situation with RuECl modified by Sn G.C. Bond, J.C.

In the latter case, the slight reduction in (H/Ru)1ot (Table I) scarcely affects hydrogenolysis rates (Table 2 and 3): if RuECIGeI RuEC1Ge2 RuECIGe3 RuEC1Sn1 RuECIPbI 139 anything they are slightly faster, and TOFs higher than for RuECI itself (Fig. 2). Product selectivities are also virtually unchanged. With Sri the rates have been lowered by about onethird, although the TOR are not much changed; a slight decrease in the values of F (Table 2) is however noted. With the RuEC3 series, the inclusion of Sn lowers the rates of hydrogenolysis by a factor of about 35, and the TOFs by a slightly smaller factor (Tables 2 and 3). Ge is somewhat less effective in lowering rates and TOFs, and both systems the selectivity parameters F and T., are reduced: their values are all much smaller than for any of the RuECl series (Fig. 3).

In the RuNI series, Sn is markedly less effective in lowering the rate than is Ge; however, inclusion of any of the modifiers in any concentration in the preparation (made by co-impregnation) appears to result in smaller Ru particles, since the (H/Ru)tot ratio is raised.

The effect of Sn is to raise both F' and T.' quite considerably, to about the values shown by RuAB37: this supports the view than Ru NIlSn1 shows the behaviour of quite small Ruparticles (H/Ru = 0.8), only slightly modified if at all by Sn. With RuNIlGe3 the selectivity parameters are moved to a much smaller extent in the same direction, and the rate is lowered about six-fold. 3.3. Effect of temperature on rates and product selectivities As has been shown in our earlier publication [2], the state of the surface is even more fully revealed by examining the temperature coefficients of the selectivities parameters. For example, with RuEC 1 after HTR 1, selectivities were almost temperature-independent, and in a second paper [3] this behaviour was shown to correlate with a lack of dependence on H 2 pressures, except at the lowest values. These effects were ascribed to a high enthalpy of adsorption. With the less well-dispersed RuEC3, selectivities were both temperature- and HZ pressure-dependent, because on the larger particles present in these catalysts the H 2 adsorption enthalpy was lower [2,3]. All the bimetallic catalysts of the RuECI series show the same small variation of selectivities with temperature as RuECl itself; indeed with RuECIGe3 (Fig. 4) the temperature coefficients are even smaller. There is no indication with either the RuEC3 or the RuAB37 series that the modifier produces much change in the temperature dependence of the selectivities: however in the RuNIl series it tends to decrease in the sequence (Fig. 5).

The arrow in (B) indicates the temperature at which conversion reaches 10%. Stage 1 activation energies for the n-butane reaction (Table 2) are slightly lowered by inclusion of Ge, and markedly so for the propane reaction (Table 3): values for both reactions are usually 120-127 kJ mol - I . For all catalysts in the n-butane reaction the stage 2 activation energies are raised, to about 145 kJ mol-I, similar increases being noted in the propane reaction, but only with the Ge-containing samples. Effects of this kind are also seen with the RuNII series (Table 2), but not for either reaction with the RuEC3 series, for which, as we have already seen, there is comparatively little deactivation between stages 1 and 2. 3.4.

The curves in this figure and in Fig. 7 are constructed using equation ESSB and the constants shown in Table 6. rates, and have modelled the results by means of the equation termed ESSB [12] which is based on a plausible mechanism which invokes a partially dehydrogenated form of the alkane as the reactive intermediate (see Scheme 1). We have carried out such measurements with propane and with n-butane on RuEC 1 Ge 1 at 427 K (see Fig. 6 for the n-butane results; corresponding results for RuECI [3] are shown for comparison), and with n-butane on RuEC3Ge at four temperatures between 379 and 410 K (see Fig. 7 for the results at 379 and 410 K, and the corresponding results for RuEC3 at 379 K). All measurements were preceded by the HTRI treatment. The constants for the equation ESSB derived from these results by the optimisation 0 oz o-a os o~ hh pressure/ atm 00 Fig. 7.

The curves drawn in Figs. 6 and 7 are obtained by use of these constants, and give a visual impression of the goodness of fit. While a meaningful assessment of the effect of the modifier cannot be made in the case of propane, because results at the same temperature are not available, some discussion of the results obtained with n-butane is in order. Comparison of the values of the constants obtained with RuEC 1 and RuEC 1 Ge 1 at - 427 K, and with RuEC3 and RuEC3Ge at 379 K, both suggest that the observed decreases in rate under the standard conditions (Table 2) are due not only to a lowering of k, by a factor of 4-6 (which is not unexpected) but also to an 8-fold depression of KA, and a halving of KH: values of x or a are comparatively unaffected. We may also compare the computed constants for the reactions of propane and of n-butane on RuEC 1 Ge 1 at 427 K (Table 6). The value of k, is somewhat larger for n-butane, and KA is about 12 times greater: this suggests that a smaller fraction of the adsorbed propane is dehydrogenated to the reactive form than is the case with n-butane, and this is in line with the larger number of H atoms that have to be removed to achieve it (viz. ^- 4.7 compared to It is not easy to decide exactly what significance to attach to the constants shown in Table 6. Of course the computation procedure yields very precise values, since it takes no account of experimental error in the measured points, and this in itself is a limiting factor. Standard deviations are also readily computed, but are not of great use for purposes of comparison, since their values depend on the range of values of the rates. The apparent close similarity between the shapes of the kinetic curves for RuEC I and RuECIGel (Fig. 6) is misleading, because the analysis shows (Table 6) an eight-fold difference in KA and a more than two-fold difference in KH. Experience based on the consequences G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa/Journal of'Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 to the values of the equilibrium constants of making small arbitrary changes to the coordinates of the experimental points teaches that they have a disproportionate effect, and that therefore differences in KA and KH of less than a factor of two should not be heeded. Note however that kl is simply a scaling factor, and its value is quite reliable. The reliability of the computed constants is much greater if the position of the maximum is clearly defined by the experimental points, but unfortunately this is not so here because the maxima lie at very low HZ pressures (Figs. 6 and 7). It should also be greater where as with RuEC3Gel the extent of deactivation during the measurements is minimal. Analysis of the results obtained by measuring the rate dependence on HZ pressure at various temperatures with RuEC3Gel (see also Table 6) provides a further insight. The Arrhenius plot of k, (see Fig. 8) yields a true activation energy of 50.3 kJ mol-1, while the Van't Hoff isochore plot of KA (see also Fig. 8) gives a - 4HA of - 93.5 kJ mot-', only a little higher than that [3] for RuEC3 itself ( - 84.3 kJ mol -' [3]). The observed lowering of KA is therefore chiefly to be associated with the entropy changes accompanying the dehydrogenation process. The Van't Hoff plot for KH passes through a gentle maximum, as was observed before with unmodified Ru catalysts after HTR1 [3]: -dHH must therefore be close to zero when the surface is substantially covered by H atoms. The changes in the form of the H 2 order curves with temperature (Fig. 7) indicates that 140 12( 601 0 0~1 003 04 08 Hi pressure ! atm 143 40 35 3-0 2-5 Y 20 Y -x 15 10 0 5'~ 0 r(max) - k, KM O K~ i t i 24 2-5 26 10 I T(K) ~o-s to -O Fig. 8. Arrhenius plots for the rate constant k, and for the maximum observed rates rmax, and Van't Hoff plots for the equilibrium constants KA and KH obtained with RuEC3Ge after HTR 1. the apparent activation energy has to be a function of the H 2 pressure at which the rate is measured. This has been shown previously in the case of RuECI [3] and of Pt/A1203 [13], and is also true for RuEC3Ge in the present work (see Fig. 9A). In order to negate the effects of changing relative concentrations of reactive species with temperature, an Arrhenius plot may be constructed using the rate at the maximum for each temperature, where OH equals OA, A being the dehydrogenated alkane.

Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 activation energy of about 62 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 8), but it is probably less reliable than that derived from kl because the fastest rates observed (which are those used for this plot) are less than the maximum rates. This is because the H 2 pressure could not be lowered sufficiently to cover the rate maximum at the lower temperatures. These Arrhenius parameters display a convincing compensation effect (see Fig. 9B), which encourages speculation [3,13,14] that such effects may often arise from comparing rates on different catalysts at various rather than constant concentrations of reactant species. Effects of H 2 pressure on selectivities are much as expected. With RuECIGel they hardly alter, the same behaviour having been shown by the parent RuECI [3]; with RuEC3Gel they respond sensitively to changing Hz pressure, as was the case also with RuEC3 [3]. Values of F' are not markedly temperature-dependent. 3.5. The effect of oxidation and re-reduction In our earlier work [2] we have noted that conversion of the metal in a pre-reduced Ru/A120.catalyst to the oxide, followed by its reduction under mild conditions (viz. the O/LTR treatment), led to much increased rates and turnover frequencies. The effect appeared to be partially explicable not only by the substantial increase in particle size accompanying this treatment, but also perhaps by the formation of a rougher (i.e. more defective) surface and/or the presence of unreduced Ru\"+ ions [2]; such ions are known to be present in the highly dispersed RuECl even after HTR [5]. We shall be reporting the results of EXAFS and further catalytic studies on catalysts subjected to O/LTR in due course. The role of these latter factors is shown by the fact after HTR2 the rates for this catalyst are lowered to about the values found after HTR1, although the TOFs are higher, because HTR2 does not cause any further major increase in particle size [2]. It therefore seemed desirable to explore the effect of these further treatments on the bimetallic catalysts; this is shown by the results for the catalysts RuEC 1 Ge3, RuNI l Sn, RuAB37Ge and RuAB37Sn in Table 4: corresponding results for the unmodified catalysts are reproduced for ease of reference. The results show that the O/LTR treatment leads to some very marked, indeed startling, increases in activity (compare Tables 2 and 4). For the pure Ru/A1203 catalysts the factors, based on rates at 433 K, are about five; this effect has been ascribed [2] to an increase in TOF in consequence of the growth in particle Table 4 Kinetic parameters for n-butane hydrogenolysis over various Ru-containing bimetallic catalysts after pretreatment O/LTR Catalyst Temp. range E In A rh SZ S3 F' T3 (K) (kJ mol- 1) RuEC 1 374-438 122 40.96 1216 0.714 0.427 0.142 0.499 373-426 120 40.61 1350 0.707 0.430 0.137 0.500 RuEC1Ge3 376-417 124 42.64 3454 0.711 0.382 0.153 0.454 417-376 129 43.73 2783 0.736 0.404 0.140 0.471 RuNI1 378-431 118 40.54 2065 0.775 0.436 0.212 0.555 428-375 116 39.48 1522 0.746 0.443 0.188 0.546 RuNIISnI 378-410 139 46.80 3620 0.765 0.382 0.148 0.450 408-376 123 42.12 2570 0.742 0.395 0.138 0.460 RuAB37 383-433 110 38.3 2205 0.720 0.440 0.160 0.524 RuAB37Ge 373-435 114 39.3 2150 0.720 0.465 0.185 0.571 RuAB37Sn 373-434 111 38.7 2661 0.735 0.433 0.168 0.520 a Rate rh, TOF and selectivity at 433 K; rh and A in mmol gRu h-1. G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular size that this treatment causes. However for the modified RuNII the factor is about 15, for the modified RuAB37 about 50-70, but for RuECIGe3 it is of the order of 5000! It is quite evident that the oxidative treatment has removed the inhibiting species (GeOx, Snx+) from the surface of the Ru particles, and that the ensuing mild reduction has not restored them. The resulting Ruparticles are therefore more or less clean, and show the same kind of high activities as the pure Ru catalysts after the same treatment. However, while in the RuAB37 series the rates after O/LTR are all very similar (Table 3), for the RuEC 1 and RuNI series the rates shown by the bimetallic catalysts are some two-and-a-half times greater than those of the corresponding pure Ru/A120 3's. The effect is especially marked between RuECl and RuEClGe3 (Table 4). Unfortunately we were unable to determine the H/Ru ratios after the O/LTR treatment, so we cannot calculate TOFs. Stage 1 activation energies are about the same as those found after HTR1 (they are somewhat lower in the RuAB37 series), but do not show the consistent elevation in the less active stage 2 that characterises the HTR1 treatment (Table 2). Further confirmation that activity following O/LTR is essentially due to unmodified (or Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 145 only slightly modified) Ru particles comes from the selectivity parameters (Table 4). Differences from the values given by the pure Ru/A1203's are comparatively minor, although where the activity of the `modified' catalyst is greater there is a lowering of the values of T,, and, in the case of RuNI l Sn 1, of F' as well: these changes are in the sense expected for an increase in particle size [8]. It is then of interest to see whether, or to what extent, modification may be re-instituted on the Ru surface by a further high-temperature reduction (HTR2: see Table 5). Rates for the modified catalysts are lower than those found after O/LTR, consistent with the behaviour of pure Ru/A1203's [2], but generally higher than after HTR 1. Detailed inspection of the rates leads us to conclude that in the RuNI series there is no restoration of the modifying species (although the value of T3 is lower for the Sn-containing sample), some limited restoration in the RuAB37 series, and perhaps somewhat more in the case of RuECIGe3. On the whole, however, the modifications observed after HTRI, whatever their cause, are far from fully replaced by HTR2, and any oxidative treatment above room temperature is therefore best avoided.

Discussion G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 4.1. Structure and activity of RuECl series bimetallic catalysts We consider first the structure and properties of Ge-containing catalysts of the RuECI series following HTR1 (Scheme 2). We recall that RuEC 1 itself is shown by a number of tests (H 2 chemisorption (Table 1), TEM, EXAFS [1,5]) to have extremely small metallic particles, probably containing only a dozen or so atoms, its catalytic properties being characterised by high values of both T3 (- 1.0) and F (^- 0.75), and a lack of marked dependence of product selectivities on both temperature [2] and HZ pressure [3]. This behaviour was attributed to strong chemisorption of H atoms, and may be denoted by the term small particle behaviour (SPB). It is inevitable that Ru particles as small as those present in RuECl after HTR1 cannot display the variety of types of site available in larger particles, and that the discrimination that the -M m RuECl ~~ RuEC1Ge1 RuEC1Ge3 M. M~ RuEC1Sn1 Obscured Ru atom Ru atom able only to chemisorb H Ru atom active for hydrogenolysis Group 14 elements may then show between different classes of site on larger particles will not be possible with those having only a few atoms. Materials containing such particles are however catalytically active, although TOFs for hydrogenolysis of propane and of n-butane (Tables 2 and 3) are 10-30 times lower for RuECl than for RuEC3. However the larger particles in RuEC3 show quite different product selectivities (T,= 0.5, F = 0.3) and much more marked variation with temperature and HZ pressure [2,3], probably because the H atoms are more weakly chemisorbed. This may be called large particle behaviour (LPB). We conclude that most if not all of the small particles in RuECl are catalytically active, and that activity is not simply due to a few large and very active particles. Although the addition of Ge or other modifiers to RuECl is unlikely to confirm the hypotheses described in the Introduction based on earlier work with larger particles [6], the EXAFS studies on the Ge-containing catalyst of the RuECl series [5,15] reveal useful information.

Slaa /Journal of Molecular They provide no evidence for Ru-Ge bonding in the samples investigated, with the possible exception of RuECIGe3. Nevertheless it is quite certain that the capability of the small particles in RuECl to chemisorb Hz and especially to hydrogenolyse alkanes is lowered progressively as the Ge content is raised (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 1). The EXAFS evidence suggests [15] that the Ge is present as an amorphous oxide, not as crystalline Ge02, and that therefore the Ge atoms formed in the initial reaction of the Ge alkyl with the reduced Ru surface were oxidised on exposure to the air, and that even the stringent HTR1 conditions failed to reduce them back to Ge The Ru particles are therefore probably either partially or completely covered by oxo-germanium species (GeOX) in which Ru-O-Ge but not Ru-Ge bonds are present (Scheme 2, A-C). Each very small Ru particle may comprise only a single active centre, or two or three at the very most, so that partial obscuration by GeOx may inactivate it completely for hydrogenolysis, although H 2 chemisorption might still be possible. This would explain the apparent trend of decreasing TOF with increasing Ge concentration (Fig. 2). This model also interprets other features of the reactions catalysed by the RuECl series. (i) There is no progressive decrease in F and T3 with the Ge-containing RuECl series (Table 2, Fig. 3), most of which show essentially SPB. Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 147 (ii) Only in the case of RuEC 1 Ge3 is there some suggestion of a decrease in the selectivity parameters, and of some formation of Ru-Ge bonds: the residual low activity might however be partly due to a few uncoated larger particles. (iii) There is no progressive change in activation energy with Ge content, except in the propane reaction where (Table 3) it is lowered by the first Ge addition. (iv) The quite marked deactivation between stages 1 and 2, which is a feature of the partially-coated catalysts, and which is more noticeable with n-butane than with propane (Tables 2 and 3), implies that a very slight `carbon deposition' may complete the deactivation of particles already partly covered: the increase in activation energy in stage 2 could reflect an alteration in the H chemisorption strength induced by multiply-bonded carbon species on particles retaining their activity. The dangers of relying simply on results obtained at a fixed H2: alkane ratio are however well illustrated by the results in Table 6, which show that the inclusion of Ge in RuECl causes a substantial decrease in KA and a smaller one in KH, as well as the decrease in k, which would be expected on the above model. This result suggests that GeOX species on or adjacent to Ru particles exert some influence particularly on the alkane dehydrogenation equilibria and to a lesser extent on KH. Values of kl are depressed (by factors of 4-6) more than propor- Table 6 Optimum values of the constants of the rate expression ES5B obtained through the effect of Hz pressure variation on rates of hydrogenolysis Catalyst Ali:e T (K) k, KA KH X RuEC1 C3H8 418 80.0 17.1 24.8 3.32 2.34 RuEC1 Ge1 C3Hg 427 11.7 0.49 7.1 3.26 2.37 RuEC 1 n-C4 H ,0 428 153.6 47.3 23.2 7.32 1.34 RuEC1Ge1 n-C,H,o 427 24.5 6.2 10.1 7.08 1.46 RuEC3 n-C4H,o 379 37.2 9.9 16.2 7.62 1.19 RuEC3Ge1 n-C41-110 379 10.7 1.2 7.7 7.04 1.48 RuEC3Gel n-C4H,o 388 13.3 3.0 8.6 6.91 1.55 RuEC3Ge1 n-C4H,o 399 23.3 6.3 12.0 7.74 1.13 RuEC3Ge1 n-C4H,o 410 31.0 11.9 11.3 7.40 1.30 148 G.C.

Note that the difference in temperature between the two data-sets for propane is not large enough to account for the changes in the equilibrium constants. Concerning the KA values, we conclude that a smaller fraction of the chemisorbed alkane is able to undergo dehydrogenation to the reactive species, but that the same species are reactive both on RuECI and on RuECIGel, as witnessed by the constant values of F and T, (Table 2 and Fig. 3). We should also note that RuEC 1 Ge 1 suffered a 60% loss in activity during measurement of the H 2 kinetics, which took place over three days, and required frequent use of standard conditions (10:1 H2: alkane) in order to correct for this. The detailed method, with typical results, has already been described for RuECI [2]. This deactivation, at fixed temperature, has an imperceptible effect on selectivity parameters (Figs. 3 and 6B), perhaps because the catalysts is partially carbided throughout. Thus the inclusion of Ge, and the variation of H 2 concentration, both affect the number of reactive centres, but not their composition as indicated by the values of F and T3. The form of the dependence of rate on H 2 pressure as interpreted by the reaction network in Scheme 1 and the derived equation ES5B means that below the maximum the rate is governed by [H * ] and above the maximum by [C,,Hx ], which is turn is limited by the availability of vacant sites needed to receive the H atoms sloughed off the alkane. The lack of change of selectivities with H2 pressure in the case of RuEC 1 Gel , observed with both propane and butane, is characteristic of SPB, while the variations observed with RuEC3Ge1, which closely resemble those shown by the parent, epitomise LPB [3]. There is little to add concerning the Sn and Pb additions, which have little effect either on rates or selectivities (Tables 1 and 2, Figs. 1-3). Sn has a minor effect on rates, and increases the deactivation between stages 1 and 2, so there may be some partial interaction in this case. The essential features of SPB are however retained. 4.2. Structure and activity of the RuEC3, RuAB37 and RuNl series Our interpretation of the effect of adding Ge and Sn to RuEC3 (Table 2 and Fig. 3) is based on the observations that the unmodified catalyst has a bimodal particle size distribution [ 1 ] and that EXAFS results [5] show no evidence of Ru-Ge bonding, although as with RuEC 1 some Ru-O-Ge bonding is not excluded. Although we cannot quantify the relative amounts of large and small particles from the TEM results [1], we may suppose that the large ones are responsible for the greater part of the activity since their intrinsic activity is greater. The observed reductions in rate and decreases in F and T3 (Table 2) may therefore be due to two factors: (i) complete encapsulation of the small particle fraction, plus in the case of Sn (ii) the possible extra effect of decorating low coordination number Ruatoms, as the prior literature [6] suggests. We note that Sn depresses the rate more than Ge in this case (Scheme 2, E-G). Concerning the RuAB37 series (Table 2), discussion is more difficult because propane hydrogenolysis has not been carried out, and we have only F' and Tj values. These do not change greatly on Ge addition, although the rate is much decreased. The Ruparticles in the parent catalyst are quite small (Table 1), and so it seems likely that the Ge (probably as amorphous GeOx) coats them completely or at least partially, so that residual activity is due to some 5% which remain active but little altered. Behaviour is thus similar to that of the RuECl series, and once again there is a very marked activity loss (- 95%) while the H/Ru ratio falls by less than 50%. Addition of Sn has however a much greater effect on F' and T3 in the direction of LPB. This is probably not due to selective site blocking because the particles are too small; remaining possibilities include (i) activity due to a few large uncovered (or selec- G.C. Bond, J.C. Slaa /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 135-149 tively covered) particles, and (ii) a restructuring of the Ru + Sn to give some large ensembles of Ru atoms. Finally we consider the NI series, in which we have observed [ 1 ] the unusual effect of the modifiers causing the Rudispersions to be greater than for the parent RuNI l (Table 1); the mechanism of this effect is not yet clear, but the values of F' and T,' confirm the trend towards SPB, shown more markedly in the case of Sn than with Ge. The modifiers do however cause the rates to decrease (Table 2), so the faster rates that might have been expected are not observed in consequence of the encapsulation of some Ruparticles. The O/LTR treatment leads to much increased rates in each case (Table 4) and to alterations in selectivity parameters that are consistent with a change to LPB. Rates are substantially decreased by HTR2, but F' and T~ still point to LPB (Table 5).[9] Acknowledgements The gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Union through Contract No. SC 1 CT91-0681.

Fax: (+44–1895)256844 The addition of Ge as GenBu4 to H-covered Ru Al2O3 (RuEC1) leads after in situ reduction at high temperature (HTR1; 758 K) to decreases in H2 chemisorption capacity and even more marked falls in activity for hydrogenolysis of propane and of n-butane. Changes in product selectivities are slight, and all Ge-containing samples exhibit similar characteristics to the parent RuEC1, which is very highly dispersed. Although loss of activity is chiefly due to encapsulation of the Ru0 particles by amorphous GeO x species, these affect neighbouring active sites by decreasing the equilibrium constant for alkane dehydrogenation to the reactive species. This conclusion follows from determinations of the rate-dependence on H2 pressure and mathematical modelling of the results. Similar behaviour is shown by the less well-dispersed RuEC3, where activity loss and selectivity changes are partly due to encapsulation by GeO x of smaller particles: some evidence for selective blocking of Ru atoms in low coordination number sites by Sn species formed analogously is however obtained. H2 pressure-dependence of the rate of n-butane hydrogenolysis was determined at four different temperatures with a GeO x -modified RuEC3, whence a true activation energy (50 kJ mol−1) and an enthalpy change for the alkane dehydrogenation step were obtained. Oxidation and low-temperature reduction ( O LTR ) of catalysts previously subjected to HTR1 led to very large increases in rate, and to changes in product selectivites, that suggested the creation of large, essentially pure, Ru particles; the modifier could not be wholly re-united with them by a second HTR. Ru Al2O3 catalysts of the NI series, prepared from inorganic precursors, showed greater dispersion in the presence of the modifier, the catalytic behaviour being in harmony with this observation.
