In each case, isomerization of the double bond to the more highly-substituted vinylene carbon occurs without rearrangement of the carbon skeleton. The rate of isomerization is very dependent on the position of the double bond, but within a homologous series, independent of the length of the carbon chain. With unsubstituted vinylenes, the equilibrium trans/cis product ratios are ca. 3.8, but 50% lower with alkyl-substituted homologues. With each alkene, the dominant reaction is co-metathesis with the resulting isomer. Homo-metathesis occurs only with the 2-methyl-2-alkenes and 3-methyl-2-pentene. Introduction Re207-Ala03 has been shown to be a catalyst of high activity and selectivity for the metathesis of a variety of olefins. We have shown, for example, that CsNOa-ReaC^-AlaOa is a very active catalyst for the metathe- sis of ra-alkenes [1,2], o',(u-dienes [3,4] and 1,4-alkadienes [5,6] with selectivitities of >94%. When used to catalyze the metathesis of methyl-1- alkenes containing six to eight carbon atoms, all underwent homo-metathesis with high selectivity. However, 2-methyl-l-hexene (2-Me-l-Cg'), exhibited an unexpected behavior. In this case, the catalyst promoted isomerization to 2-Me-2-Ce' and subsequent co-metathesis [7]. The metathesis of methyl-substituted vinylenes has received relatively little attention. Doyle reports that 3-Me-2-C5' is homo-metathesized over (re-Bu4)N[Mo(CO)6Cl]-MeAlCl2 [8], while a West German patent describes the homo-metathesis of 2-Me-l-C4' over WCXOPl^-AlCla-EtaAl [9]. An intermediate in the synthesis of musk perfume, 3,3-dimethyl-l-butene (3,3-DMe-l-C4'), is obtained by co-metathesis of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-C6' with ethylene over a WOa SiOa MgO catalyst [10]. On the other hand, McGinnis et al. report that Ph2C=W(CO)5 fails to catalyze the metathesis of 2-Me-l- 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 210 ' and 2-Me-l-C7' [11]. Even less attention has been paid to the role of reactant isomerization. If isomerization of the reactant did occur, in some cases, it may not be evident because of the symmetry of the reaction products. For example, co-metathesis of isobutene and 2-butene occurs over ReaOy-AIgOa [12] and WOa-SiOg [13,14], but isobutene yields the same product regardless of whether isomerization occurs or not. Experiments in this laboratory have shown that 2-Me-l-Ce' undergoes rapid isomerization to 2-Me-2-Ce'. The isomer then undergoes co-metathesis with the starting reagent [7]. To determine whether the isomerization of 2-Me-l-Ce' is unique, the behavior of 2-Me-l-C4', 2-Me-l-C5', 2-Me-l-Ce', 2-Me-2-C5', 2-Me-2-Cg', 2-ethyl-l-hexene (2-Et-l-Cg'), and 3-Me-2-Cg' have been examined in a continuous-flow system at atmospheric pressure over a CsN03-Re207-Al203 catalyst. Experimental Catalyst The CsNOs RegO^-AlzOa catalyst was prepared by previously described procedures [1,3]. The weight percent of Cs was calculated to be 1%, while the weight percent of Re207 was determined, after calcination at 550 C, to be 17.5% by atomic absorption spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. Reagents Chlorobenzene, used as the solvent, and toluene or o-xylene, used as internal standards, were purified by rectification over PgOs. Most of the alkyl-substituted vinylenes were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co, except 2-Me-l-C5' and 2-Me-l-Cg' which were obtained from Aldrich, and 2-Et-l-Cg' which was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. All alkyl- vinylenes were dried over 5 A molecular sieves, but used without further purification since GC analysis confirmed a purity of >99% for each. Experimental procedure The reactions were carried out in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure in a single path, continuous-flow, tubular Pyrex glass reactor with a fixed catalyst bed. In each experiment, the system was degassed and dried under vacuum. The catalyst (250 mg, 60-100 mesh) was then activated in situ at 550 C for 1.5 h in a stream of dry nitrogen (99.999%). A thermocouple placed at the center of the catalyst bed monitored its temperature. In a typical run, the reactant concentration was 1 mol%, and the feed was pumped across the catalyst bed at a rate of4mlh~1. Unless otherwise specified, W/F was 6.5 g-cat h mol~1. The effluent from the reactor was collected in a trap maintained at -60 C, and periodically analyzed on a Shimadzu Model 9A gas chroma- tograph equipped with a 50 m OV-1 chemically bonded capillary column and an FID. Volatile gases produced during a run were collected at room 211 temperature using a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton) and analyzed on a Shimadzu Model 6A gas chromatograph equipped with a 4 m Chemipack NOT column and an FID. Reaction products were identified by comparing their GC retention times and GC/MS (JEOL JMS-DX3000) fragmentation patterns with those of known compounds. In those cases where the known materials were not available, the reaction products were converted to saturated hydrocarbons under 1 atm of Hg over 5% Pt/C. The saturated analogues were then identified by comparing their retention times and/or fragmentation patterns with those of known alkanes. The % yield of isomerization is taken to be (I + C + 2H) x 100/A, where I is the number of moles of isomer remaining, C the number of moles of co-metathesis products formed, H the number of moles of homo-metathesis product formed, and A the number of moles of reactant used. Using the same notation, the percent conversion is taken to be (2C + 2H) x 100/A. The isomer ratio is taken to be the moles of isomer remaining relative to the amount of starting material remaining. Results and discussion Reactions of 2-methyl-l-alkenes With the 2-Me-l-alkenes, 2-Me-l-Cn' (re =4, 5,6), the major reaction product derives from co-metathesis of the original alkene and its isomer. For example, 2-Me-l-Ce' yields 5-Me-4-Cg', while 2-Me-l-C5' and 2-Me-l-C4' yield 4-Me-3-C7' and 3-Me-2-C5', respectively. At lower temperatures, the selec- tivity of co-metathesis product is >90%. Figure 1, which is representative of each 2-Me-l-Cn', shows that the % conversion and product distribution are independent of the time on stream. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, however, they are very dependent on reaction temperature. At low temperature, TIME ON STREAM (min.) TEMPERATURE I'c) Fig. 1.

Increasing the temperature increases the fraction of alkene undergoing isomerization and increases the rate of homo-metathesis of the isomer. Figure 4, which applies to 2-Me-l-Cg', summarizes the different reaction pathways for each of the 2-Me-l-Cn'. With each alkene, analysis of the gas phase reveals isobutene as the sole gaseous product, and at each temperature, the mass balance is >98%. The conversion of each alkene initially increases with increasing temperature, although that for 2-Me-l-Cg' becomes independent of tempera- ture above 40 C (Fig. 2). The selectivity of co-metathesis is >90% at the lower temperatures. As the temperature is raised, however, conversion to the major co-metathesis product, 5-Me-4-C9', declines, while selectivity to the homo-metathesis products, 4-Cg' and 2,3-DMe-2-C4' increases. In spite of the abundance of 2-Me-2-Ce' at the higher temperatures, the relatively small extent of 2-Me-2-Ce' homo-metathesis is thought to reflect the steric hindrance encountered in forming the metallacyclobutane intermediate. A small amount of the co-metathesis product, 2,3-DMe-2-C7' and products of high molecular weight are detected at high temperatures. The latter are c=c + c-c-c-c-c=c-c-c-c-c c C=C-C + C-C-C-C-CsC-C-C-C c c c-c=c-c-c-c-c + c=c-c-c-c c c-c=c-c + c-c-c-c=c-c-c-c c-c=c-c-c-c <! c Fig. 4.

Rearrangement of the carbon skeleton and isomerization of 2-Me-l-Ce' to 2-Me-3-C6' are not observed. Similar results occur with 2-Me-l-C5' (Fig. 4) and 2-Me-l-C4', although the absolute product ratios are somewhat different. With each alkene, the changes in product distribution are thought to reflect the yield of isomeriza- tion, i.e. the extent of conversion of 2-Me-l-Cn' to 2-Me-2-Cn'. As found with the 2-Me-l-Cg' and 2-Me-l-Ce' analogues, isomerization of 2-Me-l-C4' depends on temperature; the 2-Me-2-C4'/2-Me-l-C4' isomer ratio increases from 0.3 at 0 C to 0.8 at 25 C. The conversion of the starting alkene to metathesis products increases from 32% at 0 C to 41% at 25 C. At 0 C, the co-metathesis product 3-Me-2-C5' is the sole reaction product, while at 25 C 2,3-DMe-2-C5' and 2,3-DMe-2-C4' are formed in 2% and 4% yield, respec- tively. The former derives from the co-metathesis, while the latter product derives from the homo-metathesis of the 2-Me-2-C4' isomer. Reactions of 2-methyl-2-alkenes Under identical conditions, the behavior of 2-Me-2-alkenes, 2-Me-2-Cn' (re = 5, 6) is similar to that of the 2-Me-l-Cn' analogues. Figure 5 illustrates the temperature dependence for 2-Me-2-Cg', and is representative of the behavior found with 2-Me-2-Cs'. In general, the plot resembles those for the 2-Me-l-Ce', except that both the conversion and the selectivities are different. The conversion, about 10% at 20 C, is significantly lower. On the other hand, the selectivity of the homo-metathesis products is higher, while that for the co-metathesis products is lower. The previous experiments with the 2-Me-l- Cn' analogues show that the co-metathesis products are the result of a rapid isomerization of 2-Me-l-Cn' to the 2-Me-2-Cn' isomer. However, analyses of the reaction mixtures that result when 2-Me-2-Ce' is flowed over the catalyst show that isomerization of 2-Me-2-Ce' to 2-Me-3-Ce' does not occur, and the 2-Me-l-C6'/2-Me-2-C6' ratio is always <0.1. This indicates that the 2-Me-2- Ce' to 2-Me-l-Ce' isomerization is slow. As soon as the isomer is formed, however, co-metathesis occurs, yielding 5-Me-4-C9'. Homo-metathesis also 20 40 60 BO TEMPERATURE Cc> Fig. 5. Effects of reaction temperature on metathesis of 2-methyl-2-hexene; W/F=6.5g- cathmol\"1. 214 occurs, yielding 4-Cg' and 2,3-DMe-2-C4'. Increasing the temperature in- creases the selectivity of homo-metathesis products, but decreases that for co-metathesis product. At higher temperatures, a small amount of the co-metathesis product, 2,3-DMe-2-C7' (4% at 70 C) is formed as well as products of high molecular weight (1 2%). Similar results occur with 2-Me-2-C5'. At 25 C, for example, the selectivity of the co-metathesis product, 4-Me-3-C7', is 75%, while that for the homo-metathesis products, 2,3-DMe-2-C4' and 3-Ce', is 9%. Small amounts of co-metathesis product, 2,3-DMe-2-Ce' (ca. 2%) and products of high molecu- lar weight (ca. 2%) are also formed. The isomer ratio (2-Me-l-Cs72-Me-2- Cg') is 0.028. Reactions of 3-methyl-2-pentene With 3-methyl-2-pentene (3-Me-2-C5') the conversion increases from 12% at 25 C to 35% at 50 C, but at each temperature the conversion is lower than those for the 2-Me-l-C5' and 2-Me-2-C5'. Isomerization of the reactant to 2-Et-l-C4' occurs, but there is no indication of isomerization to 3-Me-l-Cg'. Analysis of the reaction mixture shows 2-Et-l-C4' in 5% yield at 25 C and 16% yield at 50 C. Co-metathesis of the 2-Et-l-C4' isomer and the starting material leads to principally 3-Et-2-Cs' with trace amounts of 3-Me-4-Et-3- Ce'. The selectivity for 3-Et-2-C6' is 80% at 40 C and increases to 85% at 50 C. Homo-metathesis of 3-Me-2-C5' yielding 3,4-DMe-3-Ce' occurs with a selectivity of 21% at 40 C, but decreases to 15% at 50 C. Relatively little 2-Et-l-C4' remains in the reaction mixtures, suggesting that co-metathesis occurs as soon as the isomer is formed. Consequently, the low conversion is due to the slow rate of isomerization of the double bond from the 2-position to the 1-position. Figure 6 summarizes the different reaction pathways for 3-Me-2-C5'. Fig. 6. Reaction routes of reaction products in metathesis of 3-methyl-2-pentene. 215 Reactions of 2-ethyl-l-hexene To determine the effect of the alkyi substituent, the catalyzed reactions of 2-Et-l-Ce' were examined under equivalent conditions. As found with the other alkenes, the conversion increases with increasing temperature (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 8, isomerization to 3-Me-2-C7' and 3-Me-3-C7' occurs, but at no temperatures are products detected indicative of either homo-metathesis of the original alkene or its isomeric analogues. Instead, cometathesis of the starting material and its isomers occurs (Figs. 7 and 8). With each reactant, i.e. 2-Et-l-Ce' and its isomers 3-Me-2-C7' and 3-Me-3-C7', however, co- metathesis products are limited to the formation of the least substituted alkene. As the temperature increases, the selectivities of 3-Et-2-C7' and 2-Me-l-Cg' decrease, while those of 5-Et-4-C9' and 5-Me-4-Cg' increase. At higher temperatures, the selectivity of 5-Me-4-C9' increases substantially, while the selectivity of 2-Me-l-Cg' decreases more than that of 3-Et-2-C7'. This suggests that isomerization of 2-Me-l-Ce' to 2-Me-2-Ce' occurs and the latter co-metathesizes with 3-Me-2-C7' to form 5-Me-4-C9'. The rate of isomerization appears to be independent of the size of side chain, since the rate of isomerization of 2-Et-l-Cg' to 3-Me-2-C7' or 3-Me-3-C7' is the same (Fig. 9). However, 3-Me-2-C7' appears to be more reactive than 3-Me-3-C7' since a larger quantity of the latter is detected in the reaction mixtures. Stereoselectivity of the reaction products In the catalyzed metathesis of butene and pentene, previous studies have shown that the initial trans/cis, (t/c)o, ratio depends on the alkene and the catalyst [2, 7, 15 19]. In each case, the t/c ratio increases with increasing conversion and approaches the thermodynamic ratio, (f/c)eq. On the other hand, data concerning the Stereoselectivity of liquid products or products derived from alkyl-substituted vinylenes are limited. With a CsNOa-ReaO^-AlgOa catalyst, previous studies in this laboratory have shown that the (t/c)eq ratio for homo-metathesis products of ra-alkenes [2] and methyl-1-alkenes [7] ranges from 3.1 to 4.5 (trans 76-82%).

Figure 10 depicts the four possible metallacyclobutane intermediates in the metathesis reactions [13]. Without alkyi substituents, the relative stabilities of the intermediates based on steric crowding is II>I>IV>III [2,7]. In the case of the methyl-substituted vinylenes, where the H on C2 is replaced by a methyl group, the cis configuration of I minimizes the steric crowding. On the other hand, replacing the H on C2 with a methyl group in the (raras configuration of II results in significantly more steric crowding with axial substituent (R) on Cl. The increased crowding and accompanying instability of the intermediate is thought to be the reason for the lower (t/c)eq ratio relative to those obtained with the unsubstituted alkenes. 217 40 20 0 20 40 TEMPERATURE Co Fig. 9.

Structure and double bond isomerization ofalkenes With each of the substituted alkenes examined in these experiments isomerization of the double bond occurs without rearrangement of the carbon skeleton. Isomerization occurs only when two alkyi groups are attached to the vinylene carbon. The rate of isomerization increases with increasing temperature, and the relative rates are dependent on the molecular structure of the alkene (Fig. 11). Within the homologous series 2-Me-l-Cn' or 2-Me-2-Cn', the rate of isomerization is independent of the length of the carbon chain. On the other hand, shifting the double bond to the 2-position reduces the rate of isomerization by a factor of five. The occurrence of isomerization without concurrent skeletal rear- rangement may reflect the availability of different active sites on the catalyst TABLE 1 (t/c)eq of reaction prod lucts Substrate Main product /< ) , 2-Me-l-Ce' 5-Me-4-C9' 1.7 2-Me-l-Cs' 4-Me-3-C7' 1.5 2-Me-l-C4' 3-Me-2-C5' 2.2 2-Me-2-Ce' 5-Me-4-C9' 1.7 2-Me-2-Cg' 4-Me-3-C7' 1.7 H R Fig. 10.

Although the surface area of the support and the mole percent of Rea07 suggest that the surface is principally Re207, it is quite possible that the Re207 aggregates and the catalyst surface consists of both RegOv and AlgOa. Classically strong Bronsted acid sites are generally considered essential for skeletal rearrangement. Since isomerization of these alkenes occurs without skeletal rearrangement, it is possible that the addition of CsNOg to a RegO^-AlaOs catalyst poisons the strong Bronsted acid sites [20-22]. On the other hand, isomerization occurs at the Lewis acid sites which are unaffected by a small addition of CsNOs. Nevertheless, since all of the alkyl-substituted vinylenes examined in these experiments undergo isomerization, the substituent is a major determinant of the nature of the isomerization and its rate. Further experiments are needed to detail the nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanisms at these sites. Acknowledgement We are grateful to Dr. H. D.

In each case, isomerization of the double bond to the more highly-substituted vinylene carbon occurs without rearrangement of the carbon skeleton. The rate of isomerization is very dependent on the position of the double bond, but within a homologous series, independent of the length of the carbon chain. With unsubstituted vinylenes, the equilibrium trans/cis product ratios are ca. 3.8, but 50% lower with alkyl-substituted homologues. With each alkene, the dominant reaction is co-metathesis with the resulting isomer. Homo-metathesis occurs only with the 2-methyl-2-alkenes and 3-methyl-2-pentene. References 1 T. Kawai Y.
