Graphical abstract A novel Ni/MMT-AE catalyst showed outstanding activity and stability in dioctyl phthalate (DOP) hydrogenation to di(2-ethylhexyl) hexahydro-phthalate (DEHHP). Several Ni/Montmorillonite (MMT) catalysts were prepared and evaluated in the hydrogenation of dioctyl phthalate to di(2-ethylhexyl) hexahydro-phthalate, an environmentally friendly plasticizer. Notably, a Ni/MMT-AE catalyst, which was prepared by the ammonia evaporation method, showed excellent activity and stability. It could be steadily used ten times under harsh reaction conditions, comparable to most of the noble metal catalysts. TEM results revealed that the active nickel species were highly dispersed on the surface of the MMT support with average particle sizes of 4.1 nm in the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst, resulting in its high activity. XPS and TPR results demonstrated the strong interaction between nickel and the MMT support, which could effectively inhibit the agglomeration and loss of the active nickel species during the reaction, accounting for its outstanding stability. Keywords Hydrogenation Dioctyl phthalate Nickel Ammonia evaporation method Stability Introduction Plasticizers are indispensable additives in the polymer processing industry, which can markedly improve the processability, flexibility, and fluidity of polymers [1,2]. During the processing, heating, transporting, and packaging of foods, phthalate (PAEs) plasticizers, which are the most widely used plasticizers in the polymer packaging, can easily penetrate and then enter human body. They may induce diseases through oxidative damage-mediated mechanisms due to the presence of phenyl groups and have been confirmed to bring more possibility of obesity, cancer and other problems due to the attack of the endocrine system [3–7]. Therefore, an environmentally friendly plasticizer, cyclohexane-dicarboxylate esters (CHDE), has attracted more attention in recent years [8–10]. It has been allowed in some plastics industry, including medical devices, toys and food packaging, in many countries to replace the traditional and harmful phthalates [11,12]. Catalytic hydrogenation of phthalates is the most important and efficient method to synthesize CHDE (Scheme 1 ). Considering the benzyl ring in phthalic acid esters has two moderate electron-withdrawing ester groups, its hydrogenation usually performs under harsh reaction conditions over noble metal catalysts [13–15]. For instance, Lende et al. reported that the complete hydrogenation of dioctyl phthalate (DOP) to di(2-ethylhexyl) hexahydro-phthalate (DEHHP) could be significantly improved over a Rh/Al-modified mesoporous silica foam catalyst [16]. Xu et al. found the micropore size of support played an important role in the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of DOP over Ru/AC catalysts [1]. Whereas, the high price and limited resources of the noble metals restrict their industrial applications. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop highly efficient and low-cost catalysts for phthalate hydrogenation. Nickel-based catalysts have received extensive attention in hydrogenation, [17,18] dehydrogenation [19,20] and methane reforming reactions [21,22] due to their good catalytic performance and low cost. However, there are scant reports on the hydrogenation of phthalates over nickel-based catalysts, which are mainly attributed to the harsh reaction conditions arising from the electron-deficient aromatic ring in phthalates. Zhao et al. reported that a 60 %Ni/Al2O3-B catalyst showed good activity in the hydrogenation of DOP to DEHHP, mainly due to the highly dispersed nickel, but lack of the stability result [23]. Generally, the stability of the nickel-based catalysts was not as good as the noble metal catalysts under harsh reaction conditions due to the aggregation and leaching of the Ni species [24]. Therefore, fabrication a stable nickel-based catalyst for the hydrogenation of phthalates is still a great challenge. On the other hand, montmorillonite (MMT) is a kind of natural aluminosilicate, which is composed of two layers of silica tetrahedral with a layer of aluminum octahedron [25,26]. It has several advantages such as low price, good mass-transfer efficiency, chemical and heat stability, and strong electrostatic force with metal nanoclusters due to its special structure [27]. Therefore, MMT has been applied in the construction of novel nanocomposites for broad applications, such as adsorption and catalysis [28]. However, there is no report the hydrogenation of phthalates over MMT supported catalysts. In a continuation of our research on nickel-based catalysts [24,29,30], we prepared a series of MMT supported nickel-based catalysts by different methods and applied them in the hydrogenation of DOP, the most widely used phthalate plasticizer [1]. Notably, a catalyst prepared by an ammonia evaporation method (Ni/MMT-AE) showed excellent catalytic performance, which can be recycled ten times under harsh reaction conditions, comparable to most of the noble metal catalysts. To clarify the inherent reason between the structure and catalytic performance of the Ni/MMT catalysts, the relationship between preparation methods and performance was studied and clarified. Experimental Chemicals and reagents All chemicals are analytical degree and used without further purifications. Montmorillonite was purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. DOP, n-hexane and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Factory. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate was purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Sodium borohydride was purchased from Fuchen Reagent Co., Ltd. Ammonia water and anhydrous ethanol were purchased from Tianjin East China Reagent Factory. Ultrapure Ar (99.999 %) and 10 vol% H2/Ar were purchased from Baoding Zhuoda Gas Co., Ltd. Preparation of catalysts Pretreatment of support To remove water and other impurities adsorbed in the pores of MMT, 10.0 g of MMT was heated to 450 °C with a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min and maintained for 2 h. Preparation of Ni/MMT-AE In a typical run, 0.99 g of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 34 mL of deionized water under stirring, followed by the addition of 1.0 g of MMT. Then, 25 % aqueous ammonia was dropwise added to adjust the pH value of the suspension to 11−12. Subsequently, the suspension was stirred at 40 °C for 4 h and the temperature of oil bath was then heated to 80 °C to evaporate ammonia until the pH of the suspension dropped to 7. The obtained suspension was filtered and washed with deionized water for several times, followed by three times of washing with ethanol and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained solid was calcined at 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C for 2 h with the heating rate of 1.5 °C/min, respectively. The resulting metal oxide was reduced at 450 °C for 2 h under H2 atmosphere (Scheme 2 ). The obtained catalysts are denoted as Ni/MMT-AE-X (X represents the calcination temperature). Preparation of Ni/MMT-DP In a typical run, 0.99 g of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 34 mL of deionized water under stirring, followed by the addition of 1.0 g of MMT. Then, 1.0 M NaOH solution was dropwise added to adjust the pH value of the suspension to 11−12. Subsequently, the suspension was stirred at 40 °C for 4 h and then aged for 8 h. After that, the suspension was filtered, washed with deionized water to pH = 7–8, followed by three times of washing with ethanol and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The resulting solid was heated to 300 °C with a ramp rate of 1.5 °C/min in a muffle furnace and maintained for 2 h. The resulting solid was then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at 450 °C for 2 h and the obtained catalyst is denoted as Ni/MMT-DP. Preparation of Ni/MMT-B In a typical run, 0.99 g of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 1.0 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL beaker. Then, 1.0 g of MMT was added into the above nitrate solution under stirring and dried at 80 °C overnight. After that, 0.1 g of the dried precursor was dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water. NaBH4 solution was then dropwise added into this mixed solution under stirring in an ice water bath. After standing for 5 min, the black precipitate was filtered and then washed with deionized water to pH = 7–8, followed by three times of washing with ethanol. The obtained catalyst is denoted as Ni/MMT-B. Characterization of catalysts X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD) were obtained on a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume and pore size distributions were obtained from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at -196 °C using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 specific surface and pore analyzer. The pore volume and pore size distributions were calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Jeol Jem-2100 F transmission electron microscope. H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) was collected on a PHI 1600 spectrometer using a Mg Kα source. Catalyst activity tests DOP hydrogenation was performed in a 100 mL stainless-steel autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an electric heating system. In a typical run, 2.7 g of DOP, 0.1 g of catalyst, and 60 mL of n-hexane were added into the autoclave. The autoclave was filled with H2, followed by evacuation, three times to exclude the residual air. Then, it was pressured to 5.0 MPa with H2 and heated to 150 °C. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded 1 h with a stirring speed of 500 rpm. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and analyzed by an Agilent 7820 A gas chromatograph (GC). The structure of products was confirmed by a Thermo Trace 1300 gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Results and discussion Characterization of catalysts The physicochemical properties of different Ni/MMT catalysts were first evaluated and the results are shown in Table 1 . Obviously, the Ni content in the Ni/MMT-B catalyst (13.53 %) is much lower than those of Ni/MMT-DP and Ni/MMT-AE (both 18.18 %), which can be ascribed to the leaching of the active Ni species during preparation. Notably, the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst showed the largest BET surface area, pore volume, H2-chemisorption value, metallic surface area and metal dispersion, suggesting that the active nickel species of the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst were highly dispersed on the MMT support. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the Ni/MMT-AE catalysts prepared by different calcination temperatures (Table S1) showed that the catalyst calcined at 300 °C displayed the largest hydrogen adsorption, metal surface area and metal dispersion, although the catalyst calcined at 500 °C showed the largest BET surface area (90 m2 g−1). N2 adsorption-desorption and pore size distributions of catalysts prepared by different methods and calcination temperatures are showed in Figs. 1 and S1. The results indicated that all catalysts exhibited isotherm of type IV. There was a hysteresis loop in the relative pressure region of 0.4–1.0, indicating that adsorption mainly occurred in the mesoporous region. Moreover, the hysteresis loop in the isotherms (Fig. 1 a, c and Fig.S1 a, b, c, d) was H3 type, suggesting that the pore structures in these catalysts were flat slit, cracks and wedge-shaped structures composed of flake granular material [31]. These structures conform to the natural structure of MMT and are benefit for mass transfer during the hydrogenation process. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the catalysts prepared by different methods. As for the calcined samples (Fig. 2 a), the typical diffraction peaks of MMT appeared at about 2θ = 6.7°, 21.1 °,22.3°, 35.7° and 61.8°, indicating that the MMT structure did not change after nickel loading and calcination. The weak and wide diffraction peak at 2θ = 43.7° was attributed to NiO [29,32], demonstrating that the nickel species have been uniformly distributed on the MMT support with small particle sizes. The others peak of Ni/MMT-B was distributed to the crystallization of metal salts. After the samples were reduced (Fig. 2 b), the peaks of MMT were unchanged. A new diffraction peak appeared at 2θ = 44.5°, together with the disappearance of the diffraction peak at 2θ = 43.7°, indicated the reduction of NiO to Ni in the Ni/MMT-AE and Ni/MMT-DP catalysts [29]. However, there was no diffraction peak related to Ni could be detected in the spectrum of Ni/MMT-B. The nickel species in this sample are suggested to be in an amorphous state [33]. Then, the effect of calcination temperatures was studied (Fig. S2). The diffraction peak at 2θ = 11.3° was attributed to Ni (OH)2 in the calcined Ni/MMT-AE-200 (Fig. S2 a), indicating that the nickel species in the calcined Ni/MMT-AE-200 was mainly present in hydroxide state. In contrast, the catalysts calcined at higher temperatures showed diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 43.7°, which can be attributed to NiO. Furthermore, typical diffraction peak of metallic Ni appeared at 2θ = 44.5° in all reduced catalysts (Fig. S2 b). Notably, the catalyst calcined at 300 °C had the smallest metallic Ni particle size among the catalysts studied, indicating higher Ni dispersion in this catalyst and accounting for its highest activity. TEM images of the fresh catalysts are exhibited in Fig. 3 . Obviously, the Ni nanoparticles in the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst were uniformly dispersed on the MMT support (Fig. 3a) and the particle size was in the range of 1−10 nm with an average particle diameter of 4.1 nm (Fig. 3b). For the Ni/MMT-DP catalyst, the Ni nanoparticles showed uneven shape with an average particle diameter of 5.1 nm, together with certain aggregation (Fig. 3d). The Ni nanoparticles were also unevenly distributed in the Ni/MMT-B catalyst, which agglomerated to bulk on the MMT support (Fig. 3e). The average particle diameter of Ni nanoparticles in the Ni/MMT-B catalyst was 14.8 nm (Fig. 3f), much larger than that of the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the used catalysts. Notably, the Ni nanoparticles in the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst still remained uniformly dispersed and the average particle diameter was kept to be 4.2 nm even after 10 runs (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the Ni nanoparticles obviously agglomerated with an average particle diameter of 22 nm in the Ni/MMT-DP catalyst after 10 runs (Fig. 4d). The Ni nanoparticles also increased to 18 nm in the Ni/MMT-B catalyst after 5 cycles (Fig. 4f). The above results suggested that the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst had not only the uniformly dispersed and smallest, but also the most stable Ni nanoparticles, mainly attributed to the special ammonia evaporation process, in which ammonia and Ni could form a uniformly dispersed and stable complex during the preparation, thereby preventing the reaction of the tiny Ni particles with OH− to form large Ni clusters [34]. H2-TPR profiles of the Ni/MMT-AE and Ni/MMT-DP catalysts are shown in Fig. 5 . According to the previous report [35–38], the reduction peaks between 200–400 °C could be ascribed to the reduction of free NiO with weak interaction between support. The reduction peaks appearing in the temperature range of 400–650 °C can be ascribed to the reduction of NiO that had strong interaction with support. Obviously, the Ni/MMT-DP showed three reduction peaks at 228, 314 and 388 °C, respectively, indicating that the Ni species in this catalyst were mainly from bulk NiO, which had weak interaction with support. As for Ni/MMT-AE, there were three reduction peaks at 353, 438 and 633 °C, respectively. The little peaks at 353 °C was ascribed to the reduction of the bulk NiO. The peaks at 438 and 633 °C were ascribed to the reduction of NiO that had strong interaction with MMT. The larger amounts of the latter kind of NiO would be helpful for protecting the Ni species from aggregation and leaching during the reduction and reaction process, and in turn improve the catalyst’s stability. XPS analysis is helpful to clarify the chemical states of metals and the interaction between metal and support. Thus, XPS spectra of the Ni/MMT-AE and Ni/MMT-DP catalysts were tested to further understanding these issues. As can be seen, there were two states of Ni 2 p3/2 spectra in both catalysts (Fig. 6 ). According to the literature [39,40], the binding energies of Ni and NiO are about 852 and 855 eV in the Ni 2 p3/2 spectra, respectively. Thus, the peaks at 852.96 and 852.63 eV were attributed to the metallic Ni on the surface of the MMT support [41], and the peaks at 855.98 and 856.04 eV were ascribed to the NiO species of the catalysts [42]. Some NiO were mainly due to the oxidation of the catalyst surface during the sample transfer before the XPS characterization [43,44]. It was obvious that the binding energy of metallic Ni in Ni/MMT-AE was higher than that in Ni/MMT-DP, indicating the stronger interaction between the Ni species and the MMT support in Ni/MMT-AE than in Ni/MMT-DP [45,46]. Combined with the H2-TPR results, we can demonstrate that the ammonia evaporation method can enhance the interaction between the active Ni spices and the MMT support, which can effectively suppress the agglomeration and loss of the active Ni spices during reaction, thereby improve the stability of the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst. Catalytic performance The influence of preparation methods on the catalytic performance of Ni/MMT catalysts was first examined (Table 2 ). The conversion of DOP was only 59 % over the Ni/MMT-B catalyst prepared by a chemical reduction method. In contrast, the conversions of DOP were both 99 % over the Ni/MMT-DP catalyst prepared by a deposition-precipitation method and the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst prepared by an ammonia evaporation method, demonstrating their excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, the selectivity for HEHHP were all 99 % for these catalysts. Considering stability was an important feature for industrial catalysts [47], the stabilities of these catalysts were then investigated (Fig. 7 ). Obviously, the stability of the Ni/MMT-B catalyst was very poor as the conversion of DOP sharply dropped to 10 % only after five runs (Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, the stability of the Ni/MMT-DP catalyst was still not good enough with the conversion of DOP dropping to around 60 % after ten runs (Fig. 7b). In contrast, the stability of the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst was perfectly good and the conversion of DOP kept over 90 % after ten runs (Fig. 7c), which was higher than all nickel-based catalysts and also comparable to most of noble metal catalysts in phthalate hydrogenation (Table S2). Moreover, the effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst was also tested (Fig. 7d). It was found that the catalyst calcined at 300 °C showed the best stability among the catalysts studied. Thus, 300 °C was selected as the best calcination temperature. Conclusions Preparation methods and calcination temperature were proven to play a crucial role on the catalytic performance of the Ni/MMT catalysts in DOP hydrogenation. A Ni/MMT-AE catalyst showed excellent activity and stability, which could be steadily recycled ten times under harsh reaction conditions. Moreover, compared to the catalysts prepared by the deposition precipitation and chemical reduction method, the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst had the largest BET surface area, H2-chemisorption value, metallic surface area and metal dispersion. XPS and TPR results demonstrated that the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst had stronger interaction between the Ni species and the MMT support, which could suppress the agglomeration and loss of the Ni species during the reaction, accounting for its good stability. The advantages of simple preparation method, low cost, excellent activity and good stability make this catalyst a good candidate for industrial hydrogenations under harsh reaction conditions.

        "dc:description": "Several Ni/Montmorillonite (MMT) catalysts were prepared and evaluated in the hydrogenation of dioctyl phthalate to di(2-ethylhexyl) hexahydro-phthalate, an environmentally friendly plasticizer. Notably, a Ni/MMT-AE catalyst, which was prepared by the ammonia evaporation method, showed excellent activity and stability. It could be steadily used ten times under harsh reaction conditions, comparable to most of the noble metal catalysts. TEM results revealed that the active nickel species were highly dispersed on the surface of the MMT support with average particle sizes of 4.1 nm in the Ni/MMT-AE catalyst, resulting in its high activity. XPS and TPR results demonstrated the strong interaction between nickel and the MMT support, which could effectively inhibit the agglomeration and loss of the active nickel species during the reaction, accounting for its outstanding stability.",
