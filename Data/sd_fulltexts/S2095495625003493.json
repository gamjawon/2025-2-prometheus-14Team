Graphical abstract The Cl-doped Ni2P with moderate affinity for LiPSs delivers the best conversion kinetics on sulfur reduction and Li2S oxidation. Heteroatom doping has emerged as a powerful strategy to optimize the catalytic and adsorption abilities of electrocatalysts by regulating the electronic structure, thereby enabling the development of efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the correlation between the properties of doped atoms and adsorption-catalytic ability, as well as the interconnection between adsorption strength and catalytic activity, remains underexplored. Herein, we employed halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) with different electronegativities to dope nickel phosphide (Ni2P), aiming to modulate the adsorption properties toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). We systematically explored the relationship between the electronegativity of the doping atoms and the adsorption strength, followed by exploring the connection between adsorption and catalytic capabilities. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that doping halogen atoms effectively strengthens d-p orbital hybridization between Ni atoms and S atoms, thereby enhancing LiPSs anchoring and conversion. Specifically, the chemical adsorption capability is enhanced as the electronegativity of the doped atoms increases. Moreover, the catalytic activity presents a volcano-like trend with the enhancement of adsorption performance, wherein the activity initially increases and subsequently diminishes. Therefore, Cl-doped Ni2P with moderate chemisorption ability exhibits optimal redox kinetics in bidirectional sulfur conversion. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with Cl-Ni2P-separators deliver a high-rate capacity of 790 mAh g−1 at 5 C and achieve a remarkable areal capacity of 7.36 mAh cm−2 under practical conditions (sulfur loading: 7.10 mg cm−2; electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio: 5 μL mg−1). This work uncovers the significance of achieving a balance between adsorption and catalytic capabilities, offering insights into designing efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries. Keywords Doping halogen atoms Nickel phosphide Electronegativity Adsorption Catalytic ability Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur batteries are conferred with a prominent theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh g−1, ascribable to the multielectron conversion mechanism of sulfur species [1–4]. In parallel, the active material sulfur demonstrates the virtues of low cost, environmental-friendliness, and natural abundance, making it promising as the next-generation rechargeable battery [5–8]. Nevertheless, the insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S, the substantial volume expansion, sluggish redox kinetics, and severe shuttle effect are the core issues that affect the cycling and rate performance of the battery and ultimately pose obstacles to the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries [9–15]. To alleviate the above issues, extensive research has focused on developing sulfur host or separator-modified materials to boost charge transfer, accommodate volume variation, enhance chemisorption, and accelerate sulfur conversion dynamics [16–18]. At present, transition metal compounds (TMCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent chemisorption and rapid redox conversion capabilities, which are superior to the weak physical interactions between carbon-based materials and LiPSs [19–22]. Recently, the doping of heteroatoms into TMCs has been shown to enhance catalytic and adsorption capabilities through the modulation of electronic structures [23–27]. For instance, Wang et al. elucidated that the incorporation of N atoms into CoSe2 shifts the Co 3d band towards the Fermi level, thereby weakening the S–S bonds in Li2S4 and the Li–S bonds in Li2S. This modification significantly promotes sulfur conversion and Li2S oxidation [28]. In addition, Li et al. revealed that doping B atoms into Ni2P induces electron transfer to P and introduces a certain degree of disorder around Ni atoms, ultimately enhancing the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs [29]. Despite extensive research efforts, the correlation between the properties of doped atoms and adsorption-catalytic activity still requires further investigation to deepen the understanding of catalyst design principles. In addition, although recent studies mainly focused on strengthening adsorption or catalytic activity [30–33], insufficient attention has been paid to the relationship between the adsorption and catalytic abilities with respect to sulfur species. From the perspective of traditional catalysis, the excessive adsorption effect of electrocatalysts leads to the passivation of the electrocatalysts and affects the desorption of reactant molecules, thereby depressing the rate of the electrochemical conversion [6,34,35]. Therefore, catalyst design requires balanced optimization of adsorption and catalytic properties to drive efficient sulfur conversion reactions. In this work, we introduce halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) with different electronegativities into Ni2P to achieve gradient modulation of adsorption ability and explore the relationship between the electronegativity of doped atoms and the adsorption of sulfur species. Subsequently, the effect of chemisorption strength on catalytic conversion is investigated. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that doping halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) reduces the electron density around Ni atoms, thereby enhancing the anchoring and conversion of LiPSs. The chemical adsorption capability increases with the rise in electronegativity of the doped atoms. Additionally, the catalytic ability towards LiPSs initially rises and then declines as the adsorption capacity strengthens. Thus, doping Cl atoms into Ni2P shows moderate chemical affinity, which exhibits optimal conversion kinetics for LiPSs reduction and Li2S decomposition. As a result, the resultant cells with Cl-Ni2P-separator deliver superior rate performance (790 mAh g−1 at 5 C) and exhibit a high areal capacity of 7.36 mAh cm−2 with a sulfur loading of 7.10 mg cm−2 and an electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5 μL mg−1. This research elucidates the significance of balancing adsorption and catalytic abilities, giving insights into designing efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries. 2 Results and discussion The synthetic procedure for Cl-Ni2P hollow microspheres is delivered in Fig. 1 (a). Specifically, the nickel nitrate hexahydrate, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (serving as the organic ligand), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (acting as structure directing and dispersant agent) were used to synthesize Ni-MOF by the solvothermal method and then annealed under an air atmosphere for obtaining black NiO. After that, NiO and NH4Cl were heated in a tube furnace for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, and then the resulting product was phosphorized to attain Cl-Ni2P. The synthesis of F-Ni2P and Br-Ni2P follows a similar procedure to that of Cl-Ni2P, with the only difference being the replacement of NH4Cl with NH4F and NH4Br, respectively. Combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, and Br-Ni2P inherit the hollow microspheres structure of Ni2P with the diameter of 1 μm (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1). Specifically, compared with the smooth surface of Ni2P microspheres, the surface of F-Ni2P exhibits some small particles, while the surface of Cl-Ni2P and Br-Ni2P forms nanosheets. The existence of particles or nanosheets may supply more catalytic active sites for sulfur conversion. Meanwhile, the hollow structure can physically impede the diffusion of LiPSs [36]. In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P present lattice spacings of 0.221 nm associated with the (111) plane of hexagonal Ni2P (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2). The elemental mapping images of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, and Br-Ni2P reveal the uniform distribution of Ni, P, and halogen (F, Cl, and Br) atoms, respectively, indicating the successful doping of F, Cl, and Br atoms (Fig. 1d–f). In addition, the homogeneous distribution of Ni and P atoms can be detected in Ni2P (Fig. S3). The crystallographic structure of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P is investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests (Fig. S4). The identical diffraction peaks assigned to the hexagonal Ni2P phase can be detected from the four samples, indicating that the crystal structure can be maintained after introducing F, Cl, and Br atoms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to identify the chemical states and elemental compositions of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P. The specific XPS results are listed in Table S1. The XPS spectrum of Ni 2p for Ni2P exhibits two characteristic peaks corresponding to Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 and satellite peaks (Fig. 2 a). The peaks centered at 852.9 and 870 eV are attributed to the Ni–P bonds, while those located at 856.6 and 874.2 eV are ascribed to Ni–O bonds. In addition, Ni satellite peaks are located at 861.0 and 879.1 eV. Furthermore, P 2p 3/2 and P 2p 1/2 peaks are manifested at 129.1 and 130.2 eV in the XPS spectrum of P 2p of Ni2P, respectively, which can be attributed to the P–Ni bonds. The peak centered at 133.9 eV corresponds to the P–O bond, arising from surface oxidation (Fig. S5). After introducing F, Cl, and Br atoms, the Ni 2p and P 2p peaks shift to higher binding energies compared with those of Ni2P, suggesting that the electron tends to escape from Ni and P atoms due to the high electronegativity of halogen atoms. In addition, the Ni 2p and P 2p peaks of F-Ni2P shift more positively compared with those of Cl-Ni2P and Br-Ni2P due to the stronger electronegativity of F atom. The XPS spectra of F 1s, Cl 2p, and Br 3d are investigated as delivered in Fig. 2(b). F 1s spectrum shows a peak located at 686.4 eV, which belongs to Ni–F bond [37]. Cl 2p spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks of Cl 2p 3/2 (199.1 eV) and Cl 2p 1/2 (200.7 eV), indicating the generation of Ni–Cl bonds [38]. Br 3d spectrum is divided into Br 3d 5/2 (66.8 eV) and Br 3d 3/2 (69.0 eV) peak, which is ascribed to Ni–Br bonds [39]. The above results indicate that F, Cl, and Br atoms are doped successfully in Ni2P. The adsorption behavior of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P toward LiPSs was verified by the Li2S6 adsorption experiment (Fig. S6). Compared with the yellow-color Li2S6 solution with Ni2P, the solution containing F-Ni2P turns pellucid, the solution with Cl-Ni2P is close to colorless, and the solution with Br-Ni2P exhibits a light yellow. In addition, a similar result can be detected by ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra. The Li2S6 solution containing F-Ni2P presents the lowest adsorption intensity, and the peak intensities of Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P increase progressively. The above phenomena indicate the chemical adsorption ability to LiPSs is enhanced with the increase of electronegativity of doped atoms. The chemical states of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P after adsorbing Li2S6 were investigated using XPS analysis (Fig. 2c and Fig. S7), and the specific data are presented in Table S2. After interacting with Li2S6, a negative shift of Ni 2p and P 2p peaks of four samples indicates the increased electron density in the Ni and P atoms, which is caused by the electron transfer from Li2S6 to Ni2P during the chemical anchoring of Li2S6 on Ni2P-based materials. Furthermore, compared with Ni 2p and P 2p peaks of Ni2P-Li2S6, the corresponding peaks for F-Ni2P-Li2S6, Cl-Ni2P-Li2S6, and Br-Ni2P-Li2S6 shift more negatively, validating the reinforced chemical adsorption ability by introducing the halogen atoms. Moreover, the magnitude of the negative shift of the peak follows the trend: F-Ni2P-Li2S6 > Cl-Ni2P-Li2S6 > Br-Ni2P-Li2S6. The electrocatalytic ability for LiPSs conversion also plays a vital role in enhancing performance, so a series of reaction kinetics tests were performed. Above all, the symmetric cells with F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P are fabricated to conduct cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 3 a). The symmetric cells with F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, and Br-Ni2P deliver a higher current response compared with those with Ni2P, illustrating the accelerated liquid-liquid phase conversion kinetics by doping halogen atoms. Particularly, the symmetric cell with Cl-Ni2P exhibits the highest peak current, revealing the excellent ability toward LiPSs conversion. In addition, the catalytic ability of liquid-solid and solid-liquid phase conversions was also evaluated. In Li2S nucleation tests, F-Ni2P (660 s, 331.4 mAh g−1), Cl-Ni2P (540 s, 405.4 mAh g−1), and Br-Ni2P (580 s, 285.7 mAh g−1) exhibit earlier nucleation times and higher capacities compared with Ni2P (1070 s, 181.0 mAh g−1), validating the facilitated Li2S precipitation due to the introduction of halogen atoms in Ni2P (Fig. 3b–e). Notably, the quickest response time and the highest capacity can be detected by Cl-Ni2P compared with F-Ni2P and Br-Ni2P, indicating the superior ability of Cl-Ni2P for Li2S nucleation [40–42]. In addition, the Li2S decomposition curve of Cl-Ni2P delivers the quickest current response and the largest decomposition capacity (645 s, 604.7 mAh g−1) compared with that of F-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P, verifying the remarkable ability of Cl-Ni2P in Li2S oxidation (Fig. S8) [43,44]. Therefore, the introduction of the Cl atom in Ni2P exhibits optimal catalytic conversion ability on the nucleation and decomposition of Li2S, thereby promoting the bidirectional sulfur conversion between Li2S and LiPSs. To verify the effect of doping halogen atoms with different electronegativities in Ni2P for Li-S batteries, a series of electrochemical performance tests were conducted in the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, Cl-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator. These separators were fabricated by coating different samples on the Celgard separator, and the thickness of the modified layer is 8.3 μm (Fig. S9). CV measurements were implemented to evaluate the influence of the cells with F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P separators on sulfur conversion kinetics (Fig. 3f). Two cathodic peaks centered at 2.35 and 2.00 V are ascribed to the formation of soluble LiPSs and Li2S from S8, respectively. During the charge process, the anodic peaks located at 2.35 and 2.42 V are credited to the transformation of Li2S to soluble LiPSs and S8, respectively. The highest peak response current and the lowest polarization can be detected in the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator compared with the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator. Additionally, the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator also exhibits the smallest Tafel slopes (Fig. S10), testifying faster redox kinetics for sulfur conversion due to the introduction of Cl atom in Ni2P. Subsequently, CV tests at different scan rates (Fig. S11) were performed to calculate the Li-ion diffusion coefficient ( D L i + ) by Randles-Sevick equation. The fitted plots of A, C1, and C2 peaks and corresponding D L i + values are presented in Fig. S12 and Table S3. The values of D L i + for the cells with Cl-Ni2P-separator are the highest compared with those of the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator, revealing the promoted Li+ diffusion and redox dynamics of sulfur conversion due to doping Cl atoms in Ni2P. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the reinforcement of Cl-Ni2P on different sulfur conversion steps. The EIS plot and corresponding data under open-circuit voltage are delivered in Fig. 3(g) and Table S4. At high-frequency regions, the intercept and semicircle are ascribed to the ohmic resistance (R s) and charge transfer resistance (R ct) [45], respectively. The lowest R ct value is attained by the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator compared with that of the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator, elucidating the rapid electron transfer on Cl-Ni2P. Subsequently, the activation energies (E a) at different voltages were calculated by the Arrhenius equation due to the linear relationship between temperature and the natural logarithm of the reciprocal of R ct. EIS profiles of the cells with F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P separator are illustrated in Figs. S13–S16 and the corresponding fitting curves are posted in Fig. 3(h) and Fig. S17. During the discharge processes, the E a value gradually increases in tandem with the generation of short-chain LiPSs and Li2S. In contrast, the E a value decreases as Li2S is oxidized to sulfur during charge processes, revealing that the formation of Li2S is a rate-controlling step during the entire discharge/charge processes (Fig. 3i). Specifically, the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator presents the smallest E a value at different discharge/charge voltages compared with the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator, validating the superior catalytic ability for the conversion processes of various sulfur species. To further evaluate the influence of doping Cl atoms in Ni2P on rate and long-cycling performance, electrochemical tests were carried out. The cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator delivers the enhanced rate ability compared with the other cells, delivering higher capacities of 1502, 1193, 1099, 992, 901, and 771 mAh g−1 at 0.2–5 C, respectively (Fig. 4 a). Note that, a capacity of 511 mAh g−1 is presented for the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator at 10 C, while the rate capability of the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator is inferior, delivering a capacity of 404, 331, and 258 mAh g−1, respectively. Subsequently, a capacity of 939 mAh g−1 is achieved with the current density back to 2 C, elucidating the outstanding reversibility of sulfur conversion. Additionally, the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the cells with Cl-Ni2P-separator (Fig. 4b) deliver the flatter plateaus and the corresponding potential gap (between the charge and discharge plateaus) (Fig. 4c) is the lowest compared with those of the cells with the F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator (Fig. S18), revealing the facilitated redox dynamic. In addition, the polarization during charge and discharge processes is evaluated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement (Fig. S19) [46–48]. Compared with the cells with the F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator, the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator exhibits the smallest polarization at different charge/discharge stages, signifying the promoted redox dynamics of sulfur conversion due to the introduction of Cl atoms in Ni2P. Subsequently, the cycling performance of the cells with F-Ni2P-separator, Cl-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator was performed at different current densities. A high capacity of 1038 mAh g−1 and a lower capacity fading rate of 0.064% are attained by the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator after 500 cycles at 2 C compared with the cells with F-Ni2P-separator (940 mAh g−1, 0.078%), Br-Ni2P-separator (932 mAh g−1, 0.088%), and Ni2P-separator (761 mAh g−1, 0.12%), indicating promoted cycling stability by doping Cl atoms in Ni2P (Fig. 4d). Besides, the GCD curves of the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator exhibit the lowest potential gap, indicating the excellent sulfur conversion dynamics (Fig. S20). The long-term cycling tests at ultra-high rates of 5 C (Fig. S21) and 10 C (Fig. S22) are implemented. The cells with Cl-Ni2P-separator exhibit 790 and 517 mAh g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively, and the corresponding capacity decay is as low as 0.06% and 0.04%, indicating the superior long-term cycling stability and high-rate ability. The shuttle current tests were performed to explore the ability to inhibit shuttle effect of the cell with F-Ni2P-separator, Br-Ni2P-separator, Cl-Ni2P-separator, and Ni2P-separator (Fig. S23). The smallest value of shuttle current is detected by the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator compared with those of other cells, revealing the strengthened anchoring ability for LiPSs and enhanced sulfur conversion by doping Cl atoms. In addition, the surface morphology of the lithium anode was explored by SEM (Fig. S24) after cycling. The lithium metal obtained by the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator delivers a smoother surface and lower content of sulfur deposition, revealing the promoted ability to restrain the shuttle effect and alleviate the corrosion for the lithium anode. In situ Raman spectra are implemented to estimate the influence of using Cl-Ni2P-separator and Ni2P-separator on alleviating the shuttle effect and sulfur conversion kinetics. At the initial stage of the discharge process of the cell with Ni2P-separator, the peaks located at 219 and 475 cm−1 belong to the signal of S8/S8 2− (Fig. S25). Subsequently, two peaks centered at 400 and 455 cm−1 are gradually detected, which are ascribed to the S6 2−/S4 2− and S4 2−/S3 2− [20,49,50]. The peak intensity of S6 2−/S4 2− and S4 2−/S3 2− gradually decreased during the charge process. During the charge/discharge processes, the presence of prominent LiPSs signals suggests a severe shuttle effect, wherein the continuous migration of soluble LiPSs across the electrolyte leads to irreversible loss of active sulfur species. In contrast, faint characteristic peaks of S8/S8 2−, S6 2−/S4 2−, and S4 2−/S3 2− are gradually detected at the initial discharge stage in the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator, indicating the dissolution of a small amount of LiPSs in the electrolyte. Notably, as the discharge depth increases, the intensity of these signals gradually decreases and becomes almost undetectable during subsequent charging, suggesting a low concentration of dissolved LiPSs in the electrolyte. The above results indicate that the superior adsorption and bidirectional catalytic ability of Cl-Ni2P mitigate the LiPSs shuttle effect during cycling, thereby enhancing sulfur utilization (Fig. 4e–g). The Li-S cells with high sulfur loading and low electrolyte content are important strategies to meet the requirements of the practical applications. The cells with Cl-Ni2P-separator were fabricated with an E/S ratio of 7 μL mg−1 and sulfur loading of 2.61, 4.06, and 5.37 mg cm−2, which exhibit an area capacity of 3.48, 4.45, and 5.85 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 C, respectively (Fig. S26). Subsequently, the higher sulfur loading of 7.10 mg cm−2 and less content of electrolyte (E/S ratio of 5 μL mg−1) are applied in the cell with Cl-Ni2P-separator (Fig. 4h). The battery delivers a high capacity of 7.36 mAh cm−2 and achieves 90 stable cycles at 0.1 C, elucidating the outstanding ability of inhibiting the LiPSs shuttle and facilitating sulfur conversion dynamics by introducing the Cl atoms. To further investigate the influence of doping halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) with different electronegativities in Ni2P on the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, the DFT simulations were implemented. The halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) substituted the phosphorus atoms in Ni2P to attain the configuration of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, and Br-Ni2P. The charge density difference in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) views indicates that the electron density of Ni decreases while the electron density around halogen atoms increases with the enhancement of electronegativity (Fig. S27). Bader charge analysis indicated that Ni-1 and Ni-2 atoms in F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, and Br-Ni2P lost 0.19/0.18, 0.09/0.07, and 0.04/0.02 electrons, respectively, consistent with XPS results. This electron depletion around Ni atoms can optimize the adsorption strength and catalytic activity towards LiPSs [51]. Subsequently, the binding energies between S8/LiPSs and different substrates were investigated, and the optimization models of S8/LiPSs on the surface of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P are illustrated in Figs. S28–S31. Specifically, the incorporation of halogen atoms in Ni2P can enhance the binding energies for sulfur species. The binding energies of sulfur species exhibit a positive correlation with the increasing electronegativity of the doped atoms. F-Ni2P exhibits the strongest chemisorption for LiPSs, Cl-Ni2P delivers moderate binding energy with sulfur species, and Br-Ni2P shows the weakest chemical affinity for LiPSs (Fig. 5 a). The charge density difference plots point out the charge exchange between F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P and LiPSs and elucidate the formation of Ni–S and P–Li bonds (Fig. S32). Subsequently, the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population method (pCOHP) was performed to investigate the bonding and antibonding properties of Ni–S and S–S bonds [52]. Specifically, from Ni2P to Br-Ni2P, then to Cl-Ni2P, and finally to F-Ni2P, the integrated-COHP (iCOHP) of Ni–S bonds between different substrates and Li2S4 becomes more negative, while the iCOHP of S–S bonds shifts towards positive values. The above results indicate the increased bonding strength of Ni–S bonds and the weakened S–S bonds (Fig. 5b, c and Fig. S33), which is beneficial to enhancing chemical anchoring for sulfur species [52,53]. Subsequently, the mechanism of the enhancement of chemisorption ability due to the introduction of halogen atoms with different electronegativities is explored by analyzing the partial density of states (DOS) of Ni 3d orbitals. The d-band center of Ni atoms in F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P is located at −1.414, −1.420, −1.425, and −1.444 eV, respectively. The above results validate that the d-band center of Ni 3d orbitals gradually approaches the Fermi level as the electronegativity of the doped atoms increases, which enhances the interaction with sulfur species (Fig. 5d) [54,55]. Generally, the adsorption strength of electrocatalysts towards molecules will affect their catalytic conversion ability [19,34,44]. Thus, the effect of doping halogen atoms in Ni2P on the catalytic activity of sulfur conversion was investigated. The gap of the d-p band center (the gap between the d-band center of Ni 3d orbital and p-band center of P 2p orbital) was calculated and Cl-Ni2P possesses the smallest gap compared with F-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P, which is beneficial to promoting the charge transfer and sulfur conversion kinetics [56,57]. Additionally, the Gibbs free energies of different sulfur species on F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P are investigated (Fig. 5e). The conversion processes from S8* to Li2S6* exhibit the negative value of Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG), indicating that these conversion steps are spontaneous [58]. The positive ΔG values detected in the reduction processes from Li2S6* and Li2S* elucidate an unspontaneous reaction. The smallest ΔG value of Cl-Ni2P can be achieved compared with F-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P, indicating that sulfur reduction conversion is thermodynamically favorable on the surface of Cl-Ni2P. Notably, the ΔG value is the largest for the conversion process from Li2S2* to Li2S*, demonstrating that this process is a rate-limiting step [59,60]. The Cl-Ni2P delivers the lowest ΔG value compared with F-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P, validating the facilitated Li2S reduction. During the charge process, the decomposition of Li2S is considered a rate-limiting step, which can also exert a significant impact on electrochemical performance. Thus, the decomposition barrier of Li2S on the surface of F-Ni2P, Cl-Ni2P, Br-Ni2P, and Ni2P was investigated. Specifically, the energy barrier of Li2S on Cl-Ni2P (0.22 eV) is lower than that on F-Ni2P (0.30 eV), Br-Ni2P (0.35 eV), and Ni2P (0.65 eV), indicating that doping Cl atoms in Ni2P can more effectively promote the Li2S decomposition (Fig. 5f–i) [61]. Additionally, the Li+ diffusion behavior was further investigated to reveal the potential of doping different electronegativity atoms on redox dynamics of LiPSs (Fig. S34). The lowest Li+ diffusion energy barrier of 0.24 eV is achieved on the surface of Cl-Ni2P compared with that of F-Ni2P (0.26 eV), Br-Ni2P (0.27 eV), and Ni2P (0.36 eV), indicating the fastest Li+ diffusion behavior, which favors the enhancement of sulfur redox kinetics [54]. The above results indicate that the introduction of Cl atoms into Ni2P exhibits moderate adsorption ability and effectively enhances the kinetics for both the sulfur reduction and Li2S oxidation reaction. In contrast, doping Br atoms in Ni2P shows weak chemisorption, which exhibits slow conversion kinetics and leads to severe shuttle of LiPSs. Doping F atoms in Ni2P delivers strong adsorption for LiPSs, which leads to inhibition of the desorption of LiPSs and passivation of the catalytic active sites, thereby slowing down LiPSs conversion (Fig. 5j). Overall, the catalytic ability for sulfur conversion is initially enhanced and then decreases with the improvement of adsorption strength. 3 Conclusions In summary, we adopt the method of doping halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) with different electronegativities into Ni2P to regulate the adsorption performance and explore the relationship between the electronegativity of doping atoms and adsorption properties, and subsequently investigate the relationship between adsorption and catalytic ability. DFT calculations and experimental characterizations disclose that introducing F, Cl, and Br atoms into Ni2P progressively reduces the electron density of Ni atoms as the electronegativity of halogen rises. This modulation of electron density fortifies the d-p orbital hybridization between Ni atoms and sulfur, thereby enhancing the chemical anchoring towards sulfur species. Specifically, the chemical affinity toward LiPSs rises in tandem with the increasing electronegativity of the doped halogen atoms. Furthermore, the catalytic activity exhibits a volcano-shaped trend, initially increasing and subsequently diminishing as the adsorption performance is enhanced. Thus, Cl-doped Ni2P with moderate chemisorption for LiPSs delivers the best conversion kinetics on the reduction of sulfur species and the oxidation of Li2S. As a result, the cells equipped with the Cl-Ni2P-separator manifest superior specific capacities of 790 and 517 mAh g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively. Moreover, the cells can endure stable cycling for 1000 cycles at 10 C, with a capacity fading rate of merely 0.04%. In addition, a high areal capacity of 7.36 mAh cm−2 is achieved with high sulfur loading (7.10 mg cm−2) and lean electrolyte usage (E/S = 5 μL mg−1). This work reveals the influence of the electronegativity of doped atoms on adsorption strength and underscores the importance of balancing adsorption and catalytic capabilities simultaneously, providing a view for the sensible design of highly efficient electrocatalysts in Li-S batteries.

        "dc:description": "Heteroatom doping has emerged as a powerful strategy to optimize the catalytic and adsorption abilities of electrocatalysts by regulating the electronic structure, thereby enabling the development of efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the correlation between the properties of doped atoms and adsorption-catalytic ability, as well as the interconnection between adsorption strength and catalytic activity, remains underexplored. Herein, we employed halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) with different electronegativities to dope nickel phosphide (Ni2P), aiming to modulate the adsorption properties toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). We systematically explored the relationship between the electronegativity of the doping atoms and the adsorption strength, followed by exploring the connection between adsorption and catalytic capabilities. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that doping halogen atoms effectively strengthens d-p orbital hybridization between Ni atoms and S atoms, thereby enhancing LiPSs anchoring and conversion. Specifically, the chemical adsorption capability is enhanced as the electronegativity of the doped atoms increases. Moreover, the catalytic activity presents a volcano-like trend with the enhancement of adsorption performance, wherein the activity initially increases and subsequently diminishes. Therefore, Cl-doped Ni2P with moderate chemisorption ability exhibits optimal redox kinetics in bidirectional sulfur conversion. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with Cl-Ni2P-separators deliver a high-rate capacity of 790 mAh g−1 at 5 C and achieve a remarkable areal capacity of 7.36 mAh cm−2 under practical conditions (sulfur loading: 7.10 mg cm−2; electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio: 5 μL mg−1). This work uncovers the significance of achieving a balance between adsorption and catalytic capabilities, offering insights into designing efficient electrocatalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries.",
