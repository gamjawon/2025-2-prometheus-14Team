Edreva-Kardjieva* Institute of Kinetics and Catalysis, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1040 Sofia (Bulgaria) Michael A. Vuurman Department of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Johannes C. Mol Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (Netherlands) Abstract The question whether rhenium is the only element to form just one type of structure on A1203 and MgO in the oxide form of the olefin metathesis catalyst precursor remains open. A contribution to the elucidation of this problem was obtained using samples of Re20,/A1,03, calcined in air and then washed with cold, hot and boiling water, and studied using diffuse reflectance and laser Raman spectroscopy. The bands in both spectra did not change position after washing, but decreased in intensity. If F(Rr,) at i. = 250 run and at = 300 nn is examined as a function of Re content, two straight lines passing through the origin are obtained. This was taken as an indication that only one type of isolated species exists on the carrier surface. The Raman spectra supported this conclusion, revealing that the spectra are due to isolated monomeric Re04 tetrahedra. The Raman spectra of Re201/Mgo indicate that, on this support, rhenium also forms only distorted Re04 structures after calcination in air. Introduction In a previous study [1], based mainly on the results of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the idea was advanced that NH,Re04 after impregnation on A1203 and calcining in air formed a polymeric monolayer of surface aluminium mesoperrhenate (`AlRe05') over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. Identical diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded for other metal oxide supports such as Mg0 [2], Zr02 and Ga203 [3] after NH,Re04 or HRe04 impregnation and calcining. Other authors, using different physical methods, identified Re04 tetrahedra bound to the *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 C 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 298 carrier surface [4-8]. Some of them propose the presence of a dimeric structure such as Re20, at high concentrations [5]; other authors, even at low concentrations [8]. The question of whether rhenium represents a unique case in forming only one type of structure on Al203 and MgO in the oxide form of the precursor for olefin metathesis catalysts remains open. We feel that a contribution to the elucidation of this problem may be obtained from the study of Re20,/Al,O, samples, calcined in air and then washed with H20. This procedure was followed by diffuse reflectance (DR) and laser Raman spectroscopy. Laser Raman spectroscopy was also used to study Re20,/MgO samples of various rhenium loadings. Experimental The samples containing 0.5-20 wt.% Re207 were obtained by the standard procedure of impregnation of y-A1203 (Al-USSR, 210 m2 g-1) [3]. The rinse-water treatments were carried out as follows: 0.200 g aliquots from the same batch of the calcined catalyst were washed until the absorbance (A) of the rinse water at ~ = 220 nm decreased to A = 0.1-0.15. After each wash, the samples were dried and calcined again at 823 K for 2 h and their DR spectra were recorded. Special attention was paid to the rapid collection of spectra after calcining, because the intensity of the bands is sensitive to atmospheric moisture. The spectrometer used was a Beckman 5270 employing y-A1203 as a reference. The rhenium content on the surface, calculated as Re207, was determined according to [3]. The sample containing 13 wt.% Re207/MgO was prepared according to [2]. Mg(Re04)2, equivalent to 92.3 wt.% Re207/MgO1 was obtained by mixing MgC03 (Reachim, p.a.) and HRe04 (Re metallic, Fluka). Its structure was confirmed by IR and X-ray analysis [9]. A sample intended to be magnesium mesoperrhenate, Mg3(Re05)2, equivalent to 80 wt. % Re207/ MgO, was synthesized by mixing water solutions of Mg(N03)2-9H20 (Reachim, p.a.) and NH,Re04 (Fluka, puriss.). After drying at 383 K for 6 h, the sample was heated at 873 K for 4 h. The diffractogram shows strongly amorphous Mg(Re04)2. The laser Raman spectra were recorded in the 90 configuration using a Jobin Yvon HG 2S Ramanor spectrometer. The emission of a Spectra Physics 17 argon-ion laser at 514.5 nm was used as the exciting radiation. The laser power was 100-400 mW and the spectral slit width was 10 cm-1. The powdered samples were pressed into 13-mm-diameter wafers and cooled to ~t 113 K in a special sample holder to avoid any laser-induced heating effects. The error in the determination of the peak frequencies was estimated to be + 2 cm-1. 299 Results The DR spectra of samples with various Re20, loadings are presented in Fig. 1. Two bands centered at 250 and 300 nm are observed; their intensities increase with Re content. The spectrum of the nominal 20 wt.% Re20,/A'203 sample coincides with the spectrum of the 18 wt.% Re20,/AI,03 sample. However, subsequent chemical analysis of these catalysts indicated that the concentrations were 18.1 and 17.8 wt.% Re20. respectively. Chemical analysis of the other samples with a Re207 content above 5 wt.% showed that after calcining in air, minor deviations from the initial Re loading are observed (1-3.3%) (see Fig. 1 caption). The spectrum of the support A1203 against the reference A1203 is presented in curve (a) of Fig. 1. The identical shape of the bands allows us to compare their intensities using peak heights at 250 nm and 300 nm instead of integrated band intensities. Peak height values in absorption units were transformed via the Kubelka-Munk function, F(Rx ), and the values obtained were plotted against the real Re loading on the surface, expressed as Re atoms nm-z. Two straight lines passing through the origin, but with different slopes, were obtained (Fig. 2). After water treatment, the intensities of the bands diminished for the 1 wt.% and 18 wt.% Re207/A'203 samples.

In the spectra of the rinse water, bands at .? = 206 nm (E = 6060) and = 220 nm (E = 3610) were observed, typical of Re04 in aqueous solution [11]. Fine structure of the bands due to the association of Re04 with H20 molecules was also observed. Following the absorption values (A) at 220 nm,~the amount of extracted Re (calculated as Re207) was estimated, using Bouguer-Lambert-Beer's law: A = acl (l = 1 cm) at ~ = const. The results showed that after cold-water treatment, about 35o/0 of the initial Re207 loading had dissolved. Further treatment with hot water increased the percentage to 61%, and after treatment with boiling water it was 83o/0. DR spectra revealed that after drying and calcining of the treated samples the bands at 250 and 300 nm had not changed their positions but had decreased in intensity compared with the initial sample (Fig. 3). The F(R,y) values at 250 and 300 nm versus the number of Re atoms nm-2 are shown in Fig. 2. These values are close to the respective straight lines of the F(R,) versus Re loading dependence with the calcined samples. Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of the 13 wt.% (12.6 wt.%) Re207/ A1203 catalyst. Only three bands, at 974, 930 and 335 cm-1, are observed for both the calcined and hot-water-washed samples. The latter sample exhibits lower intensities for all three peaks. The Raman spectrum of 13 wt.% Re207/MgO shows the same three vibrational bands at 977, 928 and 338 cm-1 as rhenium oxide on A1203 (Fig. 5(a)).

Discussion According to Bouguer-Lambert-Beer's law, a linear dependence of the intensity of an absorption band on the concentration means that the absorbing species are isolated and do not undergo changes with changing concentration. If they interact among themselves, deviation from linearity is observed. If the curve intercepts the ordinate, this means that there is another species of constant concentration that absorbs at the same wavelengths for all measurements. According to the Kubelka-Munk theory [12]: F{Rx) r(1-Rx)2-_K 2Rx S where F{Rx} is the Kubelka-Munk function, RO is the diffuse reflectance of an infinitely thick sample, K is the absorption coefficient and S is the scattering coefficient. When S is constant, F(Rx ) values represent the 303 true absorption spectrum of the solid by means of reflectance measurements. Then, by analogy with Bouguer-Lambert-Beer's law, this equation may be written F(R,) ;z~ K ;-- c. As one can see in Fig. 1, A1203 has a low, but measurable, absorbance, which does not alter the spectra of Re207/A1203. The linear dependence of F(R,) on the Re loading, seen in Fig. 2, shows that even at high concentrations, rhenium(VII) species do not interact among themselves (e.g., by association) to a measurable extent. The maximum capacity for accommodation of Re ions seems to be close to 18.1 wt.% Re207 (13.9 wt.% Re), which corresponds to 2.5 Re atoms nm-2. In [7] the maximum Re loading on A1,03 (180 m2 g-1) is 13 wt.% Re, which means 2.6 Re atoms nm-2. According to [ 13] this means the coverage realized is a monolayer one. The F(R,) value uersus 17.8 Re atoms nm-Z lies a little below the straight line (Fig. 2(a)), which most probably is due to the fact that the relative error of DR measurements increases exponentially outside the 0.2 ~<, R, <_ 0.7 interval [14]. For A = 0.88 (Fig. 1(g)) R, =0.132, and the relative error dF(R,)/R, is about 7% (Fig. 2(a)). The decrease in band intensity (Fig. 3) with washing demonstrates that different amounts of rhenium are dissolved after treatment with cold and hot water. The bands do not change their positions and the linearity between F(R,) and Re concentration persists (Fig. 2). This indicates that the Re(VII) species deposited on the surface do not undergo the chemical changes with washing that might have been expected. The three bands recorded in the Raman spectra (Fig. 4(a), (b)) are typical of the presence of Re04 in aqueous solution: 974 cm-1 (vl symmetric stretch of the Re04 group), 916 cm-1 (v3 antisymmetric stretch of the Re04 group) and 335 cm-1 (v2 symmetric and v4 antisymmetric bending modes of the Re04 group), as first reported by Kerhof et al. [4]. Bands characteristic of -Re-O-Re- linkages at around 800, 450 and below 200 cm-1, which exist in Re207 [15] or would have existed in the supposed surface aluminium mesoperrhenate structure [3] were not recorded either for -Re03 [15] or for -Re05 groups [16]. O O -O \\Re-O \\Re- i o i o O O O O A1 A1 All these findings indicate that under oxidative conditions Re(VII) anchors on the A1203 surface only as Re04 species. As the spectral measurements are performed at ambient conditions, the adspecies are hydrated by the atmospheric moisture. The bands observed in DR spectra at 250 and 300 nm evidently arise from Re04. As in [6], these bands are assigned to a2 --+ 5e and 4e --* 5e charge-transfer transitions, respectively, by analogy with the absorption-band assignment of ke04 in conc. H2S04 304 solution [17]. (The highest-energy band below 250 nm due to the tl --). 3t2 transition cannot be registered with enough certainty by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, unlike in the spectra of Re04 in acid solutions [ 17, 18].) Both processes, the protonation of Re04 in acid solutions and its anchoring on A1203, provoke the same distortion of Td to C3 , causing the appearance of a new band in the 280-300 nm region. The great similarity between the diffuse reflectance spectra of the calcined samples of Re, 07/A1203 and Re, 0,/MgO suggests that a mesoperrhenate structure is formed on Mg0 [2]. However, investigations by Gazzoli et al. [19] on dried and calcined Re207/MgO samples by means of in situ Raman spectroscopy indicated vibrations of Re04 moieties only. Our spectra (Fig. 5(a), (c)) are similar to those obtained for hydrated Re207/MgO and Mg(Re04)2 under ambient conditions [19]. In addition, the spectrum of the supposed magnesium mesoperrhenate, `Mg3(ReOS)2', is identical with that of Mg(Re04)1 (Fig. 5(b), (c)). The shoulder at 974 cm-1 may be tentatively assigned to unreacted NH4Re04 (VI, 976 cm-1) [6], but the presence of NH,Re04 after the prolonged heating at 873 K is less probable than the presence of Re04 anchored on the free Mg0 surface. Conclusion Under ambient conditions of oxidative precatalysis, only one type of Re(VII) oxo-structure exists, namely isolated hydrated Re04 tetrahedra, more or less distorted because of the grafting to the carrier surface. The analogy between the oxy-anion protonation and anchoring to the surface of A1203 and MgO, both leading to lowering of the new symmetry of the oxy-anions and hence to the appearance of new bands, proved to be a more realistic interpretation than a mesoperrhenate structure.

        "dc:description": "The question whether rhenium is the only element to form just one type of structure on Al2O3 and MgO in the oxide form of the olefin metathesis catalyst precursor remains open. A contribution to the elucidation of this problem was obtained using samples of Re2O7/Al2O3, calcined in air and then washed with cold, hot and boiling water, and studied using diffuse reflectance and laser Raman spectroscopy. The bands in both spectra did not change position after washing, but decreased in intensity. If F(R ∞) at λ = 250 nm and at λ = 300 nm is examined as a function of Re content, two straight lines passing through the origin are obtained. This was taken as an indication that only one type of isolated species exists on the carrier surface. The Raman spectra supported this conclusion, revealing that the spectra are due to isolated monomeric ReO4 tetrahedra. The Raman spectra of Re2O7/MgO indicate that, on this support, rhenium also forms only distorted ReO4 structures after calcination in air.",
