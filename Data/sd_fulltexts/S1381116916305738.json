Graphical abstract The effect of composition of the chlorine-containing precursors of ruthenium and heat treatment conditions on the preparation of catalysts supported on carbon composite Sibunit for the ammonia synthesis was studied. The activity of Ru-Ba/Sibunit samples was shown to depend on ruthenium dispersion and residual chlorine content in the catalyst. The removal of outer-sphere chloride ions from ammonia complexes of ruthenium via ionic exchange and the replacement of hydrogen reduction of the Ru precursor by calcination in an inert atmosphere prevent sintering and agglomeration of the active component particles, thus enhancing the catalyst activity. Keywords Ammonia synthesis Supported ruthenium catalysts Barium promoter Sibunit 1 Introduction Molecular nitrogen fixation with the formation of ammonia is among the key industrial processes. Ammonia is commonly produced by the Haber-Bosch process, which is carried out at high pressures (20–30MPA) and temperatures (620–820K) [1]. Commercial catalysts for the process are represented by iron promoted with K2O, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO and other additives [2]. Ammonia production requires high equipment expenditures, which raise the cost of the final product. Along with this, it is known that ruthenium is one of the most active catalysts for low-temperature synthesis of ammonia: its activity is five times higher as compared to iron at the same temperature and half as much pressure [3]. The use of carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts promoted with compounds of alkali (K, Cs) [4,5], alkaline earth (Ba) [6,7] or rare earth (Sm) [8] elements makes it possible to considerably decrease the process temperature (620–690K) and pressure (6–8MPa) [1]. The preparation of a supported ruthenium catalyst for low-temperature ammonia synthesis is a complicated multistep process in which the resulting activity of the sample is affected by various factors, in particular, the catalyst composition, type of promoter, structural and textural properties of the support, features of ruthenium precursors and a promoter, temperature and duration of heat treatments. Such factors commonly exert an effect on the size of particles and their resistance to sintering [9]. In a number of papers was stated that the ammonia synthesis on ruthenium-based catalysts is a structure-sensitive reaction [2,10]. The structure sensitivity is related with the presence of the ensembles of fifth ruthenium atoms (B5 sites), which are believed to be the active sites of the reaction. The quantity of these sites strongly depends on size and morphology of ruthenium particles [3]. In addition, it is known that chloride ions, which remain after decomposition and reduction of the active component, decrease the catalyst activity in ammonia synthesis. Catalysts are activated most often by a reducing heat treatment, so its duration, temperature mode and gas mixture composition also produce significant effects on the formation of catalyst particles, methanation of the carbon substrate and removal of chlorine ions [6]. This study aimed to reveal the effect of heat treatment condition and composition of chlorine-containing precursors of ruthenium during its deposition and fixation on the activity of Ru-Ba/Sibunit catalysts in ammonia synthesis. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of ruthenium precursor Complexes of divalent ruthenium [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр and [Ru(NH3)nClm](OH)р (n=5–6; m=0–1; p=1–2) were used as the precursors [11]. The ammonia-chloride complex [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр was obtained by boiling of ruthenium (IV) hydroxochloride (0.5g, reagent grade, «Reakhim») and hydroxylamine sulfate (0.71g, p.a., «Omskreaktiv») with carbamide (1.2g, p.a. «Omskreaktiv») and water (15ml) for 3h. To decrease the content of chlorine, the resulting ruthenium complex was passed through AB-17-8 anionite (ion exchange resin based on styrene with 8% divinylbenzene) in the OH form, as described in [11]. After obtaining a strongly colored solution of [Ru(NH3)nClm](OH)р, the column was washed with water. 2.2 Catalysts synthesis A mesoporous carbon composite Sibunit [12] with SBET =300m2/g was used as the support. The 0.4–0.8mm fraction was preliminarily washed with distilled water to remove carbon dust and dried at 120°С in air for 3h. To prepare the supported ruthenium catalyst, Sibunit was impregnated with an aqueous solution of the ruthenium complex, dried at 120°С in air for 3h, and then reduced in hydrogen (purity=99.98%) or calcined in flowing argon (initial purity 99.997%, additional cleaning from oxygen content was performed by passing Ar through copper shavings at 300°С) at 450°С for 4h at a heating/cooling rate of 10°C/min. The synthesized catalyst 4%Ru/Sibunit was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Ba(CH3COO)2 (p.a., «Omskreaktiv») assuming the molar ratio Ba: Ru=2.5 and dried at 120°С in air for 3h; this was followed by activation of the catalyst, first in flowing Ar at 350°С for 2h, and then in flowing H2 at 350°С for 2h at a heating/cooling rate of 5°C/min. Both the barium-free 4%Ru/Sibunit samples and the 4%Ru–13.7%Ba/Sibunit catalysts were examined (Table 1 ). 2.3 Determination of dispersion from CO chemisorption Ruthenium dispersion in 4%Ru/Sibunit catalysts was estimated using pulse chemisorption of CO. The study was performed on an AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics) analyzer. CO chemisorption was carried out after reduction of the samples with a 10%H2/Ar (puriss.) mixture by heating to 450°С and holding at this temperature for 60min, with subsequent purging with helium at 450°C for 30min and cooling the sample to room temperature. A 10 vol.% CO/He mixture (puriss.) was fed in pulses at equal time intervals into a flow of inert carrier gas (helium). The dispersion and particle size values were calculated according protocol described in [13] with regard to linear chemisorption of CO on ruthenium (the stoichiometric coefficient CO: Ru=1:1) [13,14]. 2.4 Electron microscopy A transmission electron microscopy study of the samples was performed using a JEM-2100 (JEOL) electron microscope (accelerating voltage 200kV and lattice resolution 0.145nm) with an INСA-250 (Oxford Instruments) energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Alcohol suspensions of the samples were subjected to ultrasonic dispersion (UZDN-2T) followed by deposition onto the holey carbon film supported on a copper grid. When measuring diameter of the particles, linear dimensions were calibrated against the crystal lattice of gold particles. Therewith, the measurement error for the linear dimensions on electron microscopy images did not exceed 0.02nm. The particle size distribution was obtained by measuring 150–200 particles in each case. The surface morphology and composition of the samples were examined on a JSM-6610LV (JEOL) scanning electron microscope equipped with an INCAx-Act (Oxford Instruments) spectrometer for X-ray microanalysis. 2.5 X-ray diffraction analysis X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out with a Bruker D8 Advance (Germany) powder X-ray diffractometer using a monochromatic Cu Kα source (a wavelength of 0.15418nm). The following measurement modes were employed: scanning step 0.05°, signal accumulation time 2s, voltage and filament current 40kV and 40mA, respectively, and 2θ scanning range 10–80°. The obtained diffraction patterns were interpreted using the powder diffraction database ICDD PDF-2, 2006. 2.6 XAFS spectroscopy Synchrotron radiation measurements were performed at the Structural Materials Science experimental station of the synchrotron radiation source Sibir-2 at the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute” [15]. The X-ray beam with an energy resolution ΔE/E ≈ 2 ·10−4 was monochromatized using a (220) silicon single crystal channel-cut monochromator. The Ru K-edge XAFS absorption spectra were recorded in a transmission mode using two ionization chambers that were filled with Ar and attached to Keithley picoammeters. The spectra were processed using IFEFFIT (Athena, Artemis, FEFF 6) software package [16,17]. The Fourier transforms of EXAFS oscillations were taken in a range of k =2.0÷ 12.5Å−1 with the weight coefficient k3 and approximated in a range of R=1.0÷3.0Å. 2.7 Catalytic testing The activity of 4%Ru–13.7%Ba/Sibunit catalysts in low-temperature synthesis of ammonia was measured in a fixed-bed flow reactor under a 7atm pressure of the gas mixture H2:N2 (3:1) (N2 purity=99.9991%) at a temperature of 350°С. Contact time was 1.3s, and volume of the loaded catalyst, 2cm3. Prior to catalytic measurements, the samples were purged with flowing hydrogen (40ml/min) at 350°C for 12h. Gas mixture at the reactor outlet was analyzed titrimetrically. To this end, 25ml of a 0.1 Н sulfuric acid solution prepared from analytical standard («Omskreaktiv») was placed in a bubbling flask to absorb ammonia at the reactor outlet. The gas mixture evolved at a flow rate of 42±3ml/min was bubbled for 60min; after that, an aliquot was taken from the solution and titrated against a solution of NaOH (analytical standard, «Omskreaktiv») with methyl red. The amount of NaOH consumed for titration was used to calculate the volume flow rate of NH3 (ml/min) and the volumetric concentration of NH3 at the reactor outlet (vol.%). The catalytic activity was expressed in terms of ammonia amount formed per gram of catalyst per unit time (ml NH3 gcat −1 h−1) and relative percents from equilibrium yield (5.33 vol.%) at current conditions. Data of equilibrium yields were obtained from [18]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 CO chemisorption The dispersion and average size of ruthenium particles were determined from CO chemisorption data for 4%Ru/Sibunit catalysts. The determination was made for non-modified samples since the presence of barium compounds in the catalyst substantially underrates the dispersion of supported metal [1]. According to Table 2 , the calculated average diameter of ruthenium particles in the catalysts synthesized from the [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр complex is greater than in the case of catalysts obtained from [Ru(NH3)nClm](OH)р. Dispersion of the RuCl-H2 sample treated in hydrogen is much lower than the values for other samples. Treatment in an inert medium makes it possible to produce catalysts with a smaller particle size of the active component. It should be taken into account that the calculations were made with the stoichiometric coefficient equal to unity, which corresponds to the linear sorption of CO molecule on ruthenium atom [3]. At the same time, the results obtained can be complicated by the dependence of the sorption stoichiometry of carbon monoxide on the ruthenium dispersion and support type [19]. The second reason is a possible suppression of CO chemisorption by chlorine ions [3,20]; however, as reported in [21], the presence of carbon strongly decreases this effect. 3.2 Electron microscopy To reveal the morphology of ruthenium particles and surface composition, 4%Ru/Sibunit catalysts were studied using transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). According to TEM data, the major part of the active component in the RuCl-H2 catalyst is present as large (50–60nm) conglomerates (Fig. 1 a). In addition, some part of ruthenium in the catalyst remains as small isolated particles (5–8nm). Unlike the first sample, no conglomerates are observed in other studied catalysts (Fig. 1b–d), and the active component forms small roundish particles. In case of RuCl-H2 the average particle size is not determined due to difficulties of measuring the particle diameter in conglomerates. The average particle diameters for RuCl-Ar, Ru-H2 and Ru-Ar are 1.8, 3.1, and 1.8nm, respectively. The TEM data agree with the changes in particle sizes that were calculated from CO chemisorption data. A significant difference in determining the size of particles between TEM and chemisorption data can be attributed to the different stoichiometry of CO sorption on ruthenium or inaccessibility of small metal particles for chemisorption. Thus, a substantial difference between samples consists in the predominant formation of ruthenium conglomerates in the first sample. It should be noted that the annealing in argon provides a more dispersed particles of ruthenium with a narrower size distribution. The scanning electron microscopy study did not reveal significant differences in the morphology of ruthenium particles. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis of several regions of the catalysts showed the ruthenium content to be ca. 4wt.%, which is close to the calculated value. EDX did not detect chlorine in RuCl-H2, Ru-Н2 and Ru-Ar samples, while in the RuCl-Ar catalyst its content reaches ∼0.5wt.%. A possible reason of this difference is that decomposition of the [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр complex due to calcination in argon gives a compound with the composition close to RuClх (x∼2–3); therewith, chloride ions are removed incompletely during heat treatment. 3.3 X-ray diffraction analysis of 4%Ru-13.7%Ba/Sibunit catalysts Fig. 2 displays the difference spectra of samples RuBaCl-H2, RuBaCl-Ar, RuBa-H2, and RuBa-Ar (nos. 5–8, see Table 1), which were obtained by subtraction of Sibunit peaks from the initial diffraction patterns. All the studied catalysts gave no peaks corresponding to ruthenium. This can be related to high dispersion of the active component and high structural disorder of ruthenium caused by its interaction with the support. For the catalyst synthesized from [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр and reduced in hydrogen, the absence of ruthenium peaks can also be attributed to small sizes of the particles constituting the conglomerate. The reflections attributed to the orthorhombic modification of BaCO3 are present on the diffraction patterns of all the studied samples (Fig. 2). In addition, RuBaCl-H2 and RuBa-H2 catalysts reduced in hydrogen contain ca. 10–20% of a less stable rhombohedral modification of barium carbonate. It is known that barium acetate, which is used as the promoter precursor, decomposes into BaCO3 and acetone upon heating to 450–470°C [22]; however, in a reducing atmosphere this process occurs at lower temperatures. According to the literature, the phase transition of BaCO3 from orthorhombic to rhombohedral modification takes place at ∼800°C. Nevertheless, in the case of metallic ruthenium and reducing medium, this process may start already at 350°C. It should be noted that, although the barium carbonate has a high decomposition temperature (>1100°C, [23]), during a long-term reductive heat treatment of the catalyst, produced BaCO3 can decompose at lower temperatures. Thus, the study of ruthenium-barium systems supported on activated carbon [24] showed that thermolysis of Ba(NO3)2 gives the intermediate BaCO3 phase that decomposes at ≥370°С with the formation of barium oxide, which is the active modifier of ruthenium in ammonia synthesis. 3.4 EXAFS spectroscopy Fig. 3 displays the Ru K-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra for a series of Ru-Ba/Sibunit samples. The Fourier transforms of EXAFS spectra for all the samples have two typical maxima. The first one (R∼2.2Å) has the same position as the peak of the RuRu first coordination sphere, which is most pronounced in the Fourier transform of the ruthenium foil spectrum. The second Ru-L peak is caused by photoelectron scattering on the ligand that is located closer to Ru atoms than metal – on the oxygen atoms (the Ru-O peak on the radial distribution curve for RuO2 has a similar position) or on the carbon atoms that cannot be distinguished from them by EXAFS. The intensity of the Ru-L peak has close values for all the samples (except RuBaCl-H2 on which the intensity is somewhat lower), whereas the intensity of the RuRu peak strongly varies with the sample, which shows up as changes in respective coordination numbers. The simulated structural parameters obtained from EXAFS data for all four samples are listed in Table 3 . Metallic Ru has a hexagonal structure with two close but nonequivalent metal–metal distances, so the RuRu peak was described by two independent scattering pathways with different interatomic distances; Debye factors for both RuRu scattering pathways were taken equal to each other in order to decrease the number of variable parameters, and the ratio of coordination numbers was fixed as 1:2. The “N” column shows the sum of RuRu coordination numbers for both scattering paths. The RuRu distances slightly differ from those for the standard, and low values of Debye factors indicate a high ordering of the produced metal. The RuL peak was described under the assumption that RuC bonds are formed upon interaction with the support; nevertheless, the presence of the surface oxide phase in these samples cannot be ruled out. Ruthenium carbide has a tetragonal structure, but lattice parameters a and c differ by less than 2% [25], so the interaction of photoelectrons with carbon atoms from the Ru local environment in the carbide can be efficiently described by one RuC scattering pathway with interatomic distance R∼2.2Å. In the case of ruthenium oxide, which also has a tetragonal structure, one Ru-O scattering pathway is insufficient: the EXAFS model for RuO2 standard includes two scattering pathways of RuO: R∼1.9 and 2.0Å. It should be noted that the Ru-L distances obtained by simulation, in their turn, are closer to those for RuO2 (∼2.02–2.04Å) than for RuC, but coordination numbers are close to the bulk value for ruthenium carbide N0 =6 (except the RuBaCl-H2 sample). The RuRu coordination numbers successively increase in the series RuBa-Ar<RuBaCl-Ar<RuBa-H2 <RuBaCl-H2, which correlates with changes in the particle size according to CO chemisorption data. Thus, changes in coordination numbers are related to changes in the dispersion rather than in the amount of zerovalent Ru, which slightly differs for all the samples except, probably, the RuBaCl-H2 sample reduced in hydrogen, on which the coordination number of RuL is also lower as compared to other samples. According to XANES data, ruthenium in Ru-Ba/Sibunit samples are present as finely dispersed particles with a certain amount of the oxidized phase; as the fraction of this phase increases, the spectrum changes its shape and the absorption edge shifts toward high energies. The contribution of the oxidized state, which is estimated using approximation of XANES data by a linear combination of the spectra of Ru and RuO2 standards, increases in the series RuBaCl-H2 <RuBa-H2 <RuBaCl-Ar<RuBa-Ar, which correlates with changes in coordination numbers for the first coordination sphere of Ru in EXAFS spectra and can be related either to a greater fraction of the oxidized active component or to the electron deficiency of very small ruthenium particles. 3.5 Catalytic performance Activity in the ammonia synthesis was assessed for barium-modified catalysts because Ru/Sibunit samples without a promoter were virtually inactive. According to the data obtained (Table 4 ), most active are the samples synthesized from a precursor without outer-sphere chlorine, [Ru(NH3)nClm](OH)р; therewith, the best activity in this series was observed for the catalyst that was synthesized with the replacement of ruthenium reduction step by calcination in argon. Samples obtained from [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр were less active; the lowest activity in ammonia synthesis was observed for the catalyst that was synthesized from [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр and reduced in hydrogen at the step of ruthenium fixation on the support. Best activity of RuBa-Ar may be ascribed to optimal Ru particle diameter (1.8nm), because it is known that maximum number of B5 sites was found in the range of crystal sizes between 1 and 3nm [26,27]. B5 site consists of five ruthenium atoms in a specified three-dimensional arrangement which exposing a three-fold hollow site and a step edge close together, as shown in Fig. 4 [27]. The competitive adsorption of hydrogen and nitrogen is an effect which is known to occur on the surface of ruthenium catalysts. However, in case of ammonia synthesis over ruthenium-based catalysts, adsorption of hydrogen generally overrides the adsorption of nitrogen: the most of active ruthenium sites are strongly associated with hydrogen. The catalyst is therefore not capable to dissociative adsorption of N2: breaking the triple bond of nitrogen is the limiting step of reaction, so the catalytic activity is reduced [2]. Several possible mechanisms of the detrimental effect of chloride ions on the activity of ruthenium catalysts are reported in the literature. First, due to its high electronegativity, the chloride ion is able to shift electron density from a promoter (barium or alkaline cations) to itself, thus decreasing electron density on ruthenium atoms, which inhibits the cleavage of the NN triple bond. Second, the presence of chlorine enhances hydrogen sorption with respect to nitrogen at the active sites (B5) [28]. According to [28], electronegative chlorine atoms have ability to adsorb on high-coordination sites and suppress electron donation to incoming H2 molecules at adjacent lower coordination centers; thereby, hydrogen chemisorption on these low-coordination sites becomes activated. As a result, B5 sites become inaccessible to dissociative adsorption of N2 [2,6]. Thus, the RuBaCl-Ar catalyst, which was synthesized from [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр and calcined in argon at the step of active component deposition, is low active because the residual chlorine that remains in 4%Ru/Sibunit samples after calcination (according to elemental analysis by SEM) can be removed not completely by subsequent heat treatments and remains in the final catalyst. In addition, noteworthy is the possible sintering of the particles, which were obtained from chloride precursors, during heat treatment of the catalyst. According to CO chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy data for 4%Ru/Sibunit, in our case the lowest activity of the RuBaCl-H2 sample may be caused by the low dispersion of ruthenium due to formation of conglomerates. A similar effect was observed earlier for the catalysts promoted with potassium and supported on Sibunit, in which dipyridyl complexes of ruthenium were employed as the ruthenium precursors [29]. The cited study showed that the replacement of [Ru(dipy)3]Cl2 by the [Ru(dipy)3](OH)2 complex decreased ∼3-fold the average size of ruthenium particles and substantially increased the rate of ammonia synthesis. In [30], Ru(NH3)5Cl3 was chosen as a ruthenium precursor for the catalysts supported on graphitized activated carbon. It was found that its optimal reduction temperature is 400°C, while higher temperatures facilitate sintering of the particles. The literature gives quite contradictory data about the effect of chloride ions on the process of ruthenium sintering. According to [31], in the case of alumina-supported catalysts, a noticeable sintering of ruthenium particles do not occur in the reducing atmosphere and in the presence of chlorine ions. A possible reason is a stronger interaction of the active component with alumina (with respect to carbon materials). Therewith, some authors indicate a coarsening of Ru particles upon reduction of ruthenium from the chloride-containing precursor of ruthenium [32,33]. The authors of [34] suppose that in the case of Ir/Al2O3 system, upon deposition of iridium from H2IrCl6 and its subsequent reduction in hydrogen, sintering of the particles occurs due to formation of compounds of the Ir(OH)2Cl2 type, which can migrate over the catalyst surface. In the presence of atomic hydrogen these chlorine-containing intermediates add to metal crystallites and sharply increase their size. It was assumed [33] that such a mechanism is typical also of the supported ruthenium. For the catalysts on carbon supports, where functional groups are absent nearly completely, the sintering effect may be more pronounced. Another assumption may be as follows: the catalyst with residual amount of chlorine can adsorb hydrogen more strongly [28]. It is known that at the temperatures over 400°C in hydrogen with presence of ruthenium the methanation of carbon support can occur [35]. As mentioned in [6], the increasing of dechlorination temperature from 400 to 500°C leads to significant increase of average Ru particle size. Authors [6] supposed that methanation could accelerate the metal sintering by destroying the carbon support between Ru particles. Strong adsorption of hydrogen can be responsible for increasing the rate of Sibunit destruction with subsequent sintering of ruthenium. 4 Conclusions The effect of composition of the active component precursor and heat treatment conditions (changes in the composition of gas medium) at the step of its fixation on the support surface in the synthesis of barium-promoted catalysts for low-temperature synthesis of ammonia was studied. It was shown that the catalytic activity of Ru-Ba/Sibunit significantly depends on the dispersion of active component and the residual content of chlorine. According to physicochemical studies, the low activity of the catalyst synthesized from [Ru(NH3)nClm]Clр with subsequent heat treatment in hydrogen is related to sintering and agglomeration of ruthenium particles upon reduction of the complex. The removal of the outer-sphere chloride ions from the complex with the use of anion-exchange column increases the catalyst activity. The replacement of hydrogen reduction of the active component precursor by calcination in argon increases the dispersion of Ru, thus preventing its sintering. A combination of the indicated methods makes it possible to obtain the most active catalyst for low-temperature synthesis of ammonia.
