(Received February 19, 1982) Summary A coordinatively unsaturated bivalent chromium ion chemically fixed on an alumina surface was prepared by reduction of the surface Cr(F1I)ally! complex which was synthesized by the reaction between Cr(r13-C3H5)3 and surface OH groups of alumina. The Cr(II) structure with three vacant coordination positions showed a much higher activity for catalytic propene hydrogenation in the temperature range 195-285 K than the isolated Cr(III) species and conventional impregnation chromium catalysts obtained by reduction of alumna-supported Cr(VI) ions. The reaction mechanism over the active fixed Cr(IF) catalyst was explained on the basis of the welldefined active structure, the number of coordinatively unsaturated sites, kinetics and hydrogen isotope effects. Introduction The surface properties of chromium ions supported on inorganic oxides, such as structure, composition, coordination unsaturation, chemical nature, etc., have received extensive attention in relation tA3 their catalytic as well as physicochemical properties [1 - 14) . However, far fewer studies have been devoted to the catalysis of bivalent chromium, particularly alumina-supported Cr(II) ions, because of their difficult_ormation from hexavalent chromium at alumina surfaces [15 - 29) . A conventional impregnation method using aqueous solutions of inorganic ions such as Cr03 has evident disadvantages for the preparation of alumina-supported Cr(II) species. Ballard [211, a=nd Yermakov and Zakharov [221 have demonstrated the formation of surface Or-allyl complexes on silica or alumina by using Cr(i?3-C3Hs)s. We have also reported the design of well-defined structures at hiorganic support surfaces using Mo(rlkC3H5) [231, Mo2(rl3 C3.EI5)4 [24) , Cr(t/3-C~5)3 [25) or ~r2(r13-C~5)4 [2oI as starting materials. The allyl Ei304-5102/82/0000-0000/SEi2.75 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 94 ligands of the surface compounds of chemically fixed chromium were easily eliminated to leave Cr(II) species at the support surface. In the present paper we report the high activity of coordinat:vely unsaturated bivalent chromium species chemically fixed on an alumina surface for the catalytic hydrogenation of propene at low temperatures, and a reaction mechanism is presented. Experimental Preparation of fixed Crcatalyst The fixed Cr catalyst was synt' !sized on the basis of the facile reaction between Cr(rl3 'C3H5)3 and surface OH groups of an active alumina (Nishio Industry, oxidized at 823 K for 1.5 h and evacuated for 1 h, surface area = 190 m2 g 1) -employed as a support, via following steps [25] C3HSC1 + Mg(4.5 times excess) 250 I~ 10.5 h C3H]MgCl diethyl ether 243 K L5 h 195 K 20 h233 K 3 C3HSMgC1 ~ CrC13 ----~ --~ ) Cr('R3-CaHs)3 diethyl ether pentane iAl-0H 273 K '- Al-O,, 860 K 'Al-O, Cr(.13 -C3Hs)3 + ~' , ,,Cr -C~IS \"I Cr Al-OH pentane ' A.-O HZ Al-O (A1z03) (1) (2) AIM chloride of guaranteed grade (Wako Pure Chemicals) was distilled under dry argon and then refluxed over 5 A molecular sieve, followed by distillation in a flow of high purity argon (99.9995 o). Diethyl ether and pentane (GR grade) were purified by reflux over Na wire and distillation under high purity argon. Mg (99.9990) and CrC13 (9990) (Mitsuwa Kagaku Ltd.) were used without further purification. The synthesis was performed in a specially devised Pyrex glass apparatus under vacuum (1 X 10-5 torr) or in a flow of high purity Ar at atmospheric pressure. The C-C stretching peak of Cr(713-C3H5)3 (deposited on KSr disk) was observed at 1520 cm ~, indicating a ,r-allyl type [27] . The surface complex (1) formed by the fixing reaction .vas washed 4 times with purified pentane under vacuum in order to remove the residual free Cr complex. After fixing chromium onto alumina, the pentane used as a solvent for the Cr(r 3-C3H5)3 complex was evacuated at room temperature for 1 h. The complex-type catalyst (1) was sealed in U-shaped glass tubes with two breakseals and kept in the dark until required for use. The sample (1) was further evacuated at 350 K for 1 h and then converted to the grey-colored bivalent chromium species (2) by reduction with HZ (60 torr) at 860 K in situ in a closed circulating system with a liquid N, trap before propene hydrogenation. The amount of chromium fixed on the support was determined from the initial (before fixation) and the final (after fixation) concentration of 95 Cr(r 3-C3H5)3 in pentane by a known FeS04 KMn04 titration methodSome Cr remaining in the pentane was also analyzed by gravimetry as Cr,03 after oxidizing the Cr(773-C3H5)3 complex with air. Preparation o an impregnation Cr catalyst A supported Cr(VI) catalyst (0.91 wt.% as Cr/A1203) was made by a conventional impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Cr03, followed by drying at 393 K for 6 h and calcination at 773 K for 2 h. The catalyst was further oxidized with 0., (60 torr) in a closed circulating system with a liquid Nz trap- The reduced catalyst employed for propene hydrogenation was obtained by reducing the impregnation Cr(VI) catalyst with H2 (60 torr) at 863 K for 2 h followed by evacuation for 1 h in a closed circulating system with a liquid NZ trap which was placed as close as possible to the catalyst. The oxidation state of chromium in the catalyst was f 2.15 on average, according to the amount of H2 uptake in the reduction. The impregnation catalyst referred to used for propene hydrogenation is this reduced catalyst unless otherwise stated. Reaction procedures The hydrogenation and deuterogenation of propene over the fixed and impregnation catalysts were carried out in a conventional closed circulating system (dead volume: 178 cm 3) using 0.15 - 0.25 g catalyst in the temperature range 195 - 285 K. After the hydrogenation reaction, the fixed catalyst was treated with H2 (60 torr) for 2 h at room temperature in the same circulating system with a liquid NZ trap. Thus the reaction was repeated without contacting oxygen. On the other hand, the impregnation catalyst after reaction was oxidized with 02 at 843 K for 1.5 h followed by evacuation for 1 h, and then reduced with H., at 863 K for 2 h followed by evacuation for 1 h before the next run. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a 2 m column of 40% DMF/All-03 at 273 K. Results and Discussion Formation of fixed Crtfl) catalyst The fixed chromium catalyst was prepared by taking advantage of the facile reaction between surface OH groups of alumina and Cr(Tl3-C3,_103 Fn pentane solution under strictly oxygen-free conditions. The number of surface OH groups of the A1203 used was controlled to 2.2 OH/nm= (190 m2 g 1) by heat-treatment; the OH quantity was determined by measuring the amount of ethane evolved by the reaction between the OH groups and excess AI(CZHS)3 [281. The fixing reaction between Cr(rt3-C3H5)3 and the OH groups was rapid and complete within 15 min at 2 7 3 K. The quantity of Cr chemically fixed on A1203 was found to be 0.91 wt-% as Cr/ A1203 by chemical analysis. The surface complex (1) was very sensitive to oxygen and moisture but thermally stable up to 350 K in vacuum. Complex (1) 96 was evacuated at 350 K for 1 h, and then H2 (60 torr) was admitted to reductively eliminate the allyl ligands of (1) to form the fixed Cr(II) catalyst (2). The temperature was increased to 860 K (heating rate: 10 K miry 1); this temperature was maintained for 1 h. C1 - Cc hydrocarbons (C2 - C3: main species, C1: very small, C4: small) were evolved during the hydrogenlysis of the ligands. Small amounts of carbon remained after the ligand decomposition (C/Cr < 8% in atomic ratio); these were analyzed as C02 by oxidizing with 02 at 773 K. The number of allyl ligands on a Cr ion in the surface compound (1) was calculated from the equation, (i E4 1 C; + C02)/3. The value is given in Table 1, which indicates that structure (1) had one allyl ligand per Cr atom; that is, two allyl ligands of C:r(713C3H5)3 were lost by reaction with two OH groups. In fact the alumina surface with 2.2 OH/nm2 was suggested by simulation to contain many paired OH groups. The Al-O-A1 bond was much less reactive toward Cr(713-C3H5)3 under tile present conditions. The distance between two nearestneighbor chromium ions was estimated to be 1.3 nm assuming an ideal distribution of chromium on the support surface. This value clearly indicates that there is no direct interaction between two chromium species. The diamagnetic (no ESR peak) fixed Cr(II) catalyst (2) deri-red from the isolated Cr(III) species (1) showed absorption peaks at 610 and 800 nm in its UV diffuse reflectance spectrum which may be assigned to SE - sAl and SE - SE, respectively, for a trigonal conformation of dc ion [29] ; as described hereinafter the Cr(II) ion had three vacant coordination sites. The fixed Cr(II) species was converted to the monochromate structure ~Al--O- ~O) Al-0- with a CT band (Cr6+=O~ -y Crs+-O- ) at 38 7 nm AO j (lAl ~ 1TZ [30] ) by oxidizing with OZ at 773 K. The stoichiometries in the reactions with 02 or H2, Cr(II) ~ 02,773K Cr(VI), on the basis of the definite H2,863K Cr quantity are given in Table 1. The stoichiometric uptake of OZ also demonstrates the bivalent level of chromium. Again, Table 1 suggests the atomic distribution (100% dispersion) of chromium ions with an error of 6 o. These results establish the atomic distribution of defiinite Cr structures (1) and (2) when the OH nlunber of the support surface was controlled before use. The molecular design of well-defined surface structures based on the reaction between AIIO(T73-C3HS)4 or ltio2(r 3-C3Hs)4 and the controlled OH groups of alumina has been demonstrated [23, 24] although the reaction pattern between Cr(7?3-C3HS)3 and an alumina surface or the structure of the surface compound produced, should depend upon the population, distribution or oxidation properties of surface OH groups, the chemical nature of the metal complexes used, the fixing temperatures, etc. [21 - 26). A comprehensive survey of surface design of Cr(I) o Cr(VI) structures using Cr(t?3C3H3)3 and Cr2(773-C3H5)4 will be reported in a separate paper [31). 9 7 'FABLE 1 Stoichiometric behavior in the reduction and oxidation of fixed Ct catalyst Chemical analysis of Cr 0_S1 wt., o (Cr/Ai203) Number of C3-ligand/Cr in the surface complex 1.0 Hi uptake/Cr in the step, ~: Cr6 \\ O -> ~, Cr2~ 2.041 _O OZ uptake/Gr in the step, ' Gt=` Gr6 ::O 0.99 ~O The UV diffuse reflectance spectrum of the impregnation catalyst showed a complex spectrum at 443, 583(sh), 653, 717 and 820 nm in addition to CT absorption below 300 nm, suggesting the more heterogeneous nature of Cr ions. The oxidation state of chromium was +2.15 on average, according to the 142 uptake in reduction of Cr(VI) ions. Number of coordinatiuely unsaturated sites ors a Cr 'Lore The adsorption of dinitrogen on the Cr(II) structure (2) produced from (1) was investigated in the temperature range 1 70 - 184 K_ The saturation mass of adsorption was calculated to be 2.6 molecules of NZ per Cr(II) ion from the plots 1/N\"(ad) us. 1/PN, assuming a Lang.uir isotherm taking into account the adsorption on the support; the Langmuir plots showed a linear relation between them in the pressure range 9 - 200 torn The heat of adsorption for the fixed Cr(II) ion was found to be 23 t 9 M mot-', using a Van't Hoff isotherm, indicating a weak adsorption. The amount of N2 adsorbed at saturation on the impregnation catalyst was 0.9 molecules per Cr ion. The heat of adsorption obtained for the impregnation catalyst was 16 kJ mol t with a large error (t12 M mol l) because of poorer fitting of the adsorption to the Langmuir isotherm. These values are listed in `Fable 2_ Krauss [ 171 estimated the coordination unsaturation of supported Cr(II) ions on the basis of NZ adsorption measured by manometry. Thus the majority of the fixed Cr(II) ions appeared to have three vacant coordination positions, assuming that one vacant site is available for the adsorption of one NZ molecule. I3ioxygen was irreversibly adsorbed on the fixed catalyst (2), where 2.3 molecules of QZ per Gr(II) ion were adsorbed at 200 torr of 02 and 183 K taking into account the adsorption on the support. The amount of 02 adsorbed on the impregnation catalyst under similar conditions was 0.95 Q,/Cr. Atanasova et al. [181, and Kellerman and Klier f 291 observed the reversible adsorption of dioxygen on zeoliteentrapped Ci(II) ions. In contrast to the Cr(II) ion 'Located in the zeolite cavity, the Cr(II) structure (2) atomically distributed on the A1203 surface was very sensitive to dioxygen and irreversibly oxidized. It has been demonstrated in many reactions that coordinatively unsaturated sites of catalysts 98 TABLE 2 Number of vacant coordination sites and effective reaction sites for C3H6 per Cr ion of catalyst Ad species T (K) Content Fixed catalyst Impreg. catalyst N2 170 - 184 N2/Gr2 2.6 0.9 Keqb 0.020 0.030 11uc 23 t9 16-12 C'H6 240e5d propane/Grf 1_1 0.88 aValues calculated' -`nom the saturation mass of NZ adsorption. bEquilibrium constant of adsorption (tor< <) at 176 K.

The fixed Cr(II) site was found to have high coordinative unsaturation. Hydrogenation of propene catalyzed by fixed and impregnation Cr catalysts The hydrogenation of propene with HZ over the grey-colored, fixed Cr(II) catalyst (2) (0.15 g, Cr/A1203 = 0.91 wt.%) at 257 K was completed within 3 min, the reaction rate being too fast to be convenient for kinetic studies. The deuterium addition was slower than the hydrogen addition by a factor of 1.33 at 257 K. Hence propene hydrogenation with I?, instead of H= over both the fixed and impregnation catalysts was studied in the temperature range 199 - 283 K. The deuterogenation on the fixed Cr(II) catalyst (2) was still rapid and completed at 6 min at 238 K. It war. found from Fig. 1 that structure (2) had a much higher activity than the conven tional impregr!ation catalyst. The activation energy was calculated to be 15 kJ inol-1 as shown in Fig. 2, while it was 23 M mol-1 for the impregna tion catalyst. The activity of the surface Cr(III) complex (1) with an allyl group was very low (curve 4 of Fig. 1). When (1) was evacuated at 370 K for 1 h before use as a catalyst, the activity increased to the level of.curve 3 of Fig. t. This treated complex-catalyst gave the same activation energy as (2). A small portion of species (1) may have decomposed to (2) during the evacuation. In any case, the isolated Cr(111) species (1) is unlikely to have a significant activity compared with tile active Cr(II) species. Khodakov et al. [36] also report the inactivity of isolated Cr(III) ions in ethylene hydrogenation. The impregnation catalyst showed the maximum activity (3.5 time- tine activity of the Cr ((2.15) catalyst) when the Cr(VI) catalyst was mildly reduced at 673 K, the Cr oxidation state then being just 99 2 t.0 j t.0 0 h n 1 G O - o ) 0. 2 ~ 'a.S o c~ 0 n 0 0- 3 0 0 4 4 5 Reaction Time/min ,.

Accordingly, the following order for catalytic activity was concluded under the present conditions: fixed Cr(IF) species (2) > impregnated Cr(just below +3) ion > Lmpregnated Cr(+2.15) ion > isolated Cr(III) species. Cr(1I) ions entrapped in zeolite cavities [Z8] and MgQsupported Cr(II) ions obtained by severe reduction [I5] were claimed to be inactive for ethylene hydrogenation. The most active Cr structure arnong A1203-supported catalysts for propene hydrogenation at low temperatures and low Cr loadings was the highly coordinatively unsaturated Cr(II) structure. Figure 3 shows the dependencies of the initial rates of propane formation upon the partial pressures of DZ over the fixed and impregnation catalysts. The linear relation between them on the fixed catalyst (2) was found, while the rates for the impregnation catalyst increased with pressure, depicting a curve. The initial rates for the fixed catalyst smoothly reached the maximum value as the pressure increased, but for the impregnation catalyst there was a clear break in the curve.

The rates opropane formation increased linearly with an increase in the amounts of C3H6 adsorbed (C3H6(ad)) as shown in Fig. 5. Again, in Fig. 5 the amounts of C3H6Dz formed by the reaction C3Hs(ad) f Dz C3H6D2, were plotted against increasing amounts of C3H6(ad). Propene adsorbed on Cr(II) sites rapidly reacted with D2, whereas the reaction of propene adsorbed on the residual surface of A1z03 was slow under the reaction conditions. Therefore, the number of propene molecules which coordinated to and reacted on a Cr(II) ion was easily estimated. Propane, at 1.1 molecules per Cr(II) ion, was formed at saturation of C3E'6(ad) as shown in Table 2. Figure 5 and Table 2 suggest that one C3H6 molecule occupied one coordination position on a G:(11) ion at worlang states. Propane (C3H6Dz) formation by the reaction, 2 D(ad) t CAr -> C3HsDz, is depicted in Fig. 6. The amount of deutervim in tie pressure range 10 200 torn was very small and the D(ad) was desorbed by evacuation for IO min.

The fact that the B2 adsorption was very small and weak implies ff2(Dz) and K3(Dz) << 1, where (Dz) represents the partial pressure of D2Then the initial rate (ro) is teen ay the following equation, neglecting the backward reaction front (2) to (a), _ k5't26(KtK3 - $.ZK4) x (Cr(Il))(C3H6)(D2) (k_5 + k6) (I + K1(C3H6)) D H C H3 D,, C f\"' H2 i m5) ~rr (C3Hs)(Bz) f Kt(C3H6) 102 where (Gi(11)) and (C3H6) represent the a-mount of the Cr(I1_) ion (2) contained in the catalyst and the partial pressure of C3H6, respectively, and k is equal to kszo(K1K3 + K2K4)/(k-s + k6). The rate equation accounts well for the results of Figs. 3 and 4, where the initial rate of propane formation on the fixed catalyst was proportional to D2 pressure and the reciprocal of the rates had a good linear relation with the reciprocal of the C3H6 pressure, coinciding with the rate equation. The reaction appears to proceed mainly through the steps, (2) -* (3) ---- (5), as in homogeneous catalysis [37] . The hydrogenation would thus proceed via a half-hydrogenated intermediate (6) of either normal or isopropyl type. The n-propyl species must be preferred to the isopropyl species, since the hydrogenation of 1-butene took place more rapidly than the hydrogenation of cis-2-butene on the same fixed Cr(II) catalyst; the latter proceeds via sec-butyl intermediate. If the transition state of the rate-determining step includes the breaking of the Cr-hydride bond, the kinetic isotope effect (primary effect) of 0.71 would be expected. The hydrogenation of C3H6 with D, was slower by a factor of 0.75 than the reaction with H2 at 257 K. When H2, HD and D2 mixtures with various compositions (not in equilibrium) were used instead of H2 or DZ alone, hydrogen molecular identity in products was maintained. The mechanism gives a good explanation for a paired addition of dihydrogen. Burwell et a1. [32] have demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated Cr\"-02- pairs at a Cr,03 surface function as active sites. It has also been claimed [39] that on usual oxide catalysts, including Cr31_02- pair sites, dihydrogen is heterolytically dissociated. Propene hydrogenation over the fixed Cr(II) structure with no active oxygen atom appears to proceed by a different reaction mechanism. The structure (2), with three available sites, is analogous to the structure C over inorganic oxides postulated by Siegel [38] ; dihydrogen would be oxidatively dissociated on the vacant coordination positions of Cr(II). In conclusion, the fixed Cr(II) catalyst with three vacant coordination sites on a Cr(1I) ion, which was produced by reduction of the surface CI(IIl)-allyl complex (1), showed high activity for the catalytic hydrogenation of propene at low temperatures. The active Cr(II) structure (2) after an unfavorable environmental change by repeated oxidation and reduction treatments showed a considerable decrease in both the number of coordinatively unsaturated sites and the catalytic activity. This nay be why the active Cr(II) species could not be created by the usual impregnation method which requires a redox treatment for catalyst activation. The paired Cr(II)Cr(II) structure which was prepared using Cr2(713-C3H5)4 was not rearranged notably by the redox t:-eatments. References 1 C. P. Poole Jr. and D. S_ MacIver, Ads.

Iwasawa Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National University, Tokiwadai, Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama 240, Japan A coordinatively unsaturated bivalent chromium ion chemically fixed on an alumina surface was prepared by reduction of the surfaces Cr(III)-allyl complex which was synthesized by the reaction between Cr(η3-C3H5)3 and surface OH groups of alumina. The Cr(II) structure with three vacant coordination positions showed a much higher activity for catalytic propene hydrogenation in the temperature range 195–285 K than the isolated Cr(III) species and conventional impregnation chromium catalysts obtained by reduction of alumina-supported Cr(VI) ions. The reaction mechanism over the active fixed Cr(II) catalyst was explained on the basis of the well-defined active structure, the number of coordinatively unsaturated sites, kinetics and hydrogen isotope effects.
