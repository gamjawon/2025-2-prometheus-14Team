Carbon monoxide is a versatile building block for organic synthesis in the current chemical industry. In particular, hydroformylation of olefins with carbon monoxide and hydrogen is one of the most important applica- tions [1]. As is widely recognized, isocyanides are isoelectronic to carbon monoxide. Hence they form similar coordination compounds and often exhibit similar reactivities [2]. However, the reaction of olefins with iso- cyanides and hydrogen leading to the formation of aldimines, namely hydroiminoformylation, seems to have never been explored. We now report the first examples of hydroiminoformylation of olefins taking place in the presence of ruthenium carbonyl complexes. A benzene (5 ml) solution of styrene (10 mmol), cyclohexylisocyanide (2.5 mmol) and Ru3(CO)i2 (0.017 mmol) was treated with hydrogen (50 atm at room temperature) at 150 C for 12 h. GLC analysis of the resulting mixture showed the formation of iv-(2-phenylpropylidene)cyclohexyl- amine (la) in 30.4% based on the charged amount of the isocyanide (eqn. (1)). Ethylbenzene was formed in only 2.8% (based on styrene), though [Ru] CH=CH, / \\ [Ru3 + <. )-NC * H; (1) *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L6 Ru 3( CO) i2 has been known to catalyze undesired hydrogenation of olefins under the hydroformylation conditions [3]. Kugelrohr distillation of the reaction mixture (80 - 90 C/0.2 torr) afforded 83 mg of analytically pure sample, the structure of which was fully supported by spectroscopy*. Pent-1-ene also reacted similarly under the identical conditions to give JV-(2-methylpentylidene)cyclohexylamine (Ib, 3.0%), A^-hexylidene- cyclohexylamine (2b, 13.6%), ^V-(2-methylpentyl)cyclohexylamine (3b, 0.1%), and JV-hexylcyclohexylamine (4b, 2.8%) as shown in eqn. (2)**. ^^ . <Q^c . H, -^ ^ . /\\/\\^ (2) Ib 2b 3b ^^ 4b In contrast with the styrene reaction, hydrogenation of 1-pentene exten- sively proceeded. In addition, jV-methylcyclohexylamine was also formed in 16% yield (based on the isocyanide charged) presumably through hy- drogenation of the isocyanide. There are several papers reporting homo- geneous hydrogenation of isocyanide [4]. However, pentene reactions by the present procedure were usually more or less accompanied by precipita- tion of insoluble species. At the moment, we cannot unequivocally decide whether the hydrogenation of the isocyanide was homogeneously or heter- ogeneously catalyzed. It is interesting to note that the present reaction bears a seeming resemblance in regioselectivity to hydroformylation.

L7 formation of la in the reaction of styrene stems from preferential attack of ruthenium species on the inner olefinic carbon followed by migratory insertion of isocyanide in the resulting alkylruthenium complex. This is very similar to the preferential formation of the branched aldehyde usually encountered in hydroformylation of styrene catalyzed by ruthenium [5] or other catalysts [6]. Likewise, the regioisomeric ratio in the reaction of pentene is also similar to that reported for ruthenium-catalyzed hydro- formylation of 1-pentene [5]. In pentene reactions, [(PPh3)2N][HRu3(CO)n] (the total yield of Ib, 2b, 3b, and 4b = 18.4%) and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (the total yield = 10.4%) could also be used as the catalyst, the latter being slightly less active. Typical hydroformylation catalysts such as Rh4(CO)i2, Co2(CO)s and HRh(CO)- (PPti3)3 showed very little activity, the total yield being less than 0.1%. Fe3(CO)i2, RuCl2(PPh3)3 and HPt(SnCl3)(PPh3)2 were totally inactive. In any event, the catalyst performance in the present reactions is still low as compared with hydroformylation. This may be associated with isocyanides being stronger o-donors, which hinder the generation of a vacant coordina- tion site required for the occurrence of the reaction. Search for more effi- cient catalysis is under way. References 1 B. Cornils, in J. Falbe (ed.), New Syntheses with Carbon Monoxide, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1980, p.l. 2 E. Singleton and H. E.
