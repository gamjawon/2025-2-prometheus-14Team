In this study, carbon materials with ordered mesoporous structures (OMC) were used as supports for metal palladium (Pd). Using the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction as a probe reaction, a series of Pd/C catalysts supported on traditional carbon materials, such as graphene (G), carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon black (XC-72), and activated carbon (AC), were compared. Theoretical calculation predicted the promotion effect of defective carbon carrier on the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The electrocatalytic methanol oxidation performance of the Pd/OMC catalyst is significantly enhanced, with its methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity increasing by 1.9, 1.7, 1.5, and 1.4 times compared to Pd nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts supported on G, CNT, XC-72, and AC, respectively. Raman spectroscopy combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results revealed that the superior electrocatalytic performance of Pd/OMC was attributed to its higher intrinsic defect density, which enhanced the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). This interaction facilitated electron transfer from Pd NPs to the support, and the electron-deficient Pd NPs further boosted the electrocatalytic reaction performance.

Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), as green and efficient energy conversion devices, are crucial for achieving carbon neutrality goals. However, the large-scale commercialization of DMFCs still faces significant challenges [2]. Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are considered the most effective catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) [3,4]. In previous studies [5–8], researchers have focused on improving MOR performance by: (1) constructing PtM alloys with special morphologies (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru); (2) loading Pt onto functionalized carbon supports (C = CNTs, RGO, NC); (3) designing Pt single-atom catalysts, etc. However, issues such as high cost, poor resistance to CO poisoning, and slow kinetics have not been effectively addressed, underscoring the urgent need to develop cost-effective, highly active, and stable non-Pt-based MOR catalysts. As a crucial component of supported catalysts, the support plays an essential role in the reaction. A good support can enhance the adsorption of metal nanoparticles (NPs), regulate the metal-support interaction, and facilitate mass transport. Carbon materials, widely used as catalyst supports in electrocatalysis, include common supports such as XC-72 [9], AC [10], mesoporous carbon (MC) [11], CNT [12], carbon nanofibers (CNF) [13], and G [14]. An ideal electrocatalyst support should have the following characteristics: (1) resistance to corrosion in acidic and basic environments; (2) suitable pore structure to promote reactant mass transport and accelerate reaction kinetics; (3) high surface area and abundant defect sites to facilitate metal nanoparticle loading and effectively tune their electronic structure. Previous studies have reported that the pore structure and pore size of the support significantly influence the catalytic activity of the electrocatalysts [15,16]. Unfortunately, common electrocatalysts used for MOR, such as AC and XC-72, are microporous materials. The abundant micropores largely restrict the adsorption and mass transport of reactants to the active sites, thereby reducing the catalytic activity [17–19]. While macroporous materials have excellent mass transport properties, they lack micropores, leading to lower surface area and fewer defects, making them less suitable for metal loading. In mesoporous carbons, ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has a large surface area, interconnected pores, good conductivity, and confinement effects, which reduce mass transport resistance and enhance reactant binding to active sites, thus improving reaction activity [20,21]. Therefore, OMC with three-dimensional interconnected carbon nanostructures, narrow pore size distribution, and high surface area has emerged as an ideal electrocatalyst support material. Previous studies have mainly focused on surface modification of carbon materials, such as surface functionalization and heteroatom doping, while neglecting the impact of the pore structure of carbon supports on MOR activity. Typically, OMCs prepared by soft-template methods have thicker pore walls, smaller surface area, and lower pore volume [22]. In contrast, OMC prepared by hard-template methods involves infiltrating the carbon source into the channels of a hard template, followed by carbonization and template removal, which results in carbon materials with a structure opposite to that of the template. The hard-template method preserves the ordered structure of OMC at high temperatures. The resulting OMC possesses a large surface area, controllable pore sizes, and shapes. Importantly, intrinsic defects in the carbon support are known to play a crucial role in enhancing methanol electrooxidation performance. The exposure of OMC’s ordered pore structures also increases the number of inherent defect sites, suggesting that OMC could provide high electrocatalytic performance for MOR. Therefore, in this section, SBA-15 was used as a hard template, sucrose as a carbon source, and concentrated sulfuric acid as a dehydrating agent. OMC materials with mesoporous structures were prepared using a nanocasting method, and Pd/OMC electrocatalysts were synthesized via a sodium borohydride reduction method. These catalysts were compared with a series of commercial carbon supports with different physicochemical properties, such as graphene (G), which has a graphite-like planar structure, activated carbon (AC) with an amorphous microporous structure, carbon nanotubes (CNT) with a graphite layer and mesoporous structure, and XC-72 with an amorphous structure containing mesoporous and macroporous components. First, theoretical calculations were used to predict the key role of defected carbon atoms in promoting methanol adsorption and activation, anchoring Pd NPs, and enhancing metal-support interactions. Subsequently, experimental studies showed that, compared to other commercial carbon supports, OMC with an ordered mesoporous structure exhibited the highest methanol electrooxidation activity and CO poisoning resistance. This enhancement was primarily attributed to its higher defect density, which effectively tuned the electronic structure of Pd NPs, promoting the adsorption and activation of reactants and carbonaceous intermediates, thereby improving the reaction activity. In addition, the reaction pathway of methanol on the Pd/OMC surface was investigated using Attenuated Total Reflectance-InfrarRed (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. It was found that defected carbon atoms not only enhanced electrocatalytic activity but also improved selectivity toward the non-CO pathway. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials All reagents were utilized as received, without additional purification. Palladium chloride (PdCl₂, purity ≥59.5 % Pd basis), Nafion solution (Nafion, purity ≥5 %), Pluronic P123 triblock copolymer (EO20-PO70-EO20, Mn ∼ 5800, purity ≥99 %), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, purity ≥98 %) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol (EG, purity ≥98 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, purity ≥98 %), potassium hydroxide (KOH, purity ≥98 %), methanol (CH₃OH, purity ≥98 %), HCl (purity ≥37 %), and H₂SO₄ (purity ≥98.3 %) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. respectively. Deionized water was used throughout all experiments. All commercial carbon supports (AC, CNT, XC-72, and G) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. All carbon materials (OMC, CNT, AC, XC-72, and G) were dried at 100 °C for 24 h prior to Pd deposition to remove adsorbed moisture and ensure consistent catalyst synthesis conditions. 2.2 Synthesis of SBA-15 SBA-15 silica was synthesized and utilized as a hard template for OMC preparation, following the protocol by Zhao et al. [23]. A solution of 4.0 g of P123 in 30.0 g of ultrapure water and 120.0 g of 2.0 M HCl was prepared, to which 8.5 g of TEOS was added. The mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 24 h, then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100 °C for an additional 24 h. The resulting product was filtered, washed with ultrapure water and ethanol, and dried at 100 °C for 10 h. Finally, the surfactant was removed by calcining the product at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain SBA-15. 2.3 Synthesis of OMC OMC was prepared according to the method we reported before [24]. As shown in Figure S1 the OMC was synthesized by impregnating 1.0 g of SBA-15 with a solution containing 1.25 g of sucrose and 0.14 g of H₂SO₄ in 5 mL of water. This mixture was dried at 100 °C for 6 h, followed by drying at 160 °C for another 6 h. Subsequently, the product was treated with another solution of 0.8 g sucrose and 0.09 g H₂SO₄ and subjected to the same heating steps. The final material was carbonized in a tube furnace at 900 °C under a N₂ atmosphere at a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min. The silica template was removed by washing the carbon product with 2.0 M NaOH at 80 °C three times, followed by filtration and washing with deionized water and ethanol. The product was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and labeled as OMC. 2.4 Synthesis of Pd/OMC Pd/OMC catalysts were prepared via hydrothermal reduction [20]. Typically, 20.0 mg of OMC was dispersed in 30.0 mL of ethylene glycol via ultrasonication. Subsequently, 2.0 mL of H₂PdCl₆ solution (2.0 mgPd · mL⁻¹) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 24 h. The pH was adjusted to 10.0 with 2.0 M NaOH, and the suspension was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 4 h. After natural cooling, the product was washed with deionized water to a neutral pH and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The resulting catalysts were labeled Pd/OMC. 3 Result and discussion Before the experiment, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the impact of intrinsic defects in the carbon support on the formation energy of Pd NPs, the methanol adsorption energy on Pd NPs, and the effect of defects on the electronic structure of Pd NPs. As shown in Figs. 1 and S2, we constructed catalysts with Pd NPs anchored on defect sites of carbon atoms and on pristine graphite carbon, denoted as Pd/Gedge and Pd/G, respectively. Our study found that the formation energy of Pd NPs on defect sites in carbon was −6.14 eV, significantly lower than the formation energy on graphite carbon (−4.96 eV). Moreover, the adsorption energy of methanol, the reactant in electrocatalytic methanol oxidation, was also lower on defected carbon compared to graphite carbon (Fig. 1c). These results strongly indicate that intrinsic defects in the carbon support not only promote the nucleation and anchoring of Pd NPs, providing more active sites for the electrocatalytic reaction, but also greatly enhance the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby ensuring improved reaction activity. Furthermore, the differential charge density (Figure S3) shows that, in the defected carbon model, electrons transfer from Pd NPs to the carbon support. Bader charge analysis reveals that compared to Pd/G (0.09 e⁻), Pd/Gedge (1.13 e⁻) transfers more electrons to the carbon atoms. These findings suggest that edge defects enhance the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) between OMC and Pd NPs, facilitating electron transfer from Pd NPs to the carbon support. This, in turn, modulates the electronic structure and d-band center of Pd NPs. The electron-deficient Pd NPs promote the adsorption and activation of reactants during methanol electrooxidation, significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. For the analysis of the carbon support structure, the prepared carbon supports were first characterized by BET to evaluate their physical properties. As shown in Figure S4, the pore size distribution is presented in the inset of the figure S4. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of activated carbon (AC) follows a Type I curve, which shows a rapid increase in adsorption at low relative pressures (P/P₀ < 0.01), indicating the predominance of micropores. The large number of micropores gives AC a high specific surface area, as shown in Table S1. As the relative pressure increases further, the adsorption level becomes relatively flat. In contrast, XC-72, G, CNT, and OMC all exhibit Type IV isotherms FigureS3 b-e. At low relative pressures (P/P₀ < 0.01), a rapid increase in adsorption is observed, indicating the presence of micropores. When the relative pressure increases, the curve flattens. The adsorption and desorption curves do not coincide but form a hysteresis loop, which indicates the presence of mesopores. As shown in Figure S3c and d, when the relative pressure is high, the curve shows a distinct upward trend, confirming the presence of macropores. Comparing the four carbon supports with mesoporous/macroporous structures, OMC exhibits a significantly higher adsorption amount than the other three materials, indicating that OMC has a higher specific surface area Table S1. This demonstrates that the OMC prepared via the hard-template method not only effectively preserves the ordered pore structure of the template but also yields carbon materials with a higher specific surface area. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to analyze the phase structure of a series of carbon materials. As shown in Figure S4a, AC exhibits two distinct diffraction peaks around 21° and 44°, corresponding to the C(002) and C(100) planes, respectively. Notably, the C (002) diffraction peaks of XC-72, G, and CNT shift significantly to higher angles, with increased peak intensity. Additionally, compared to AC and OMC, the peaks of G and CNT are narrower, indicating a higher degree of graphitization [25]. Therefore, OMC and AC exhibit lower graphitization levels (and higher defect densities), while CNT, G, and XC-72 have higher graphitization (and lower defect densities). Small-angle XRD was also used to characterize the prepared OMC, as shown in Figure S4b. A strong peak below 1° corresponding to the (100) crystal plane of the ordered structure indicates that the prepared OMC possesses a two-dimensional hexagonal ordered mesoporous structure [26]. The phase structure of Pd NPs supported on a series of carbon materials was analyzed, as shown in Figure S5c. The XRD patterns of all catalysts show three distinct peaks at 40.1°, 46.7°, and 68.1°, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of face-centered cubic Pd [27]. Notably, among the series of catalysts, the Pd/OMC catalyst exhibits the lowest peak intensity and broader peaks for Pd species. This suggests that Pd NPs supported on OMC have the smallest particle size and the highest dispersion. This is primarily attributed to the high surface area and uniform pore structure of OMC, which facilitates the dispersion and anchoring of Pd NPs [28]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to further analyze the surface defect density of the carbon materials. The defect density was evaluated based on the ratio of peak areas of the D and G bands (AD/AG) in the Raman spectra [29], as shown in Fig. 2 . The defect density follows the trend: OMC > AC > XC-72 > CNT > G. The XPS spectra of the carbon supports are shown in Fig. 3 . The C1s XPS spectrum was deconvoluted into three components: sp² (284.79 eV) C, sp³ (285.1 eV) C, and CO (285.99 eV). The defect density of the carbon supports was evaluated using the sp²/(sp³ + sp²) ratio, with the peak areas and corresponding values presented in Table S2. The trend of the sp²/(sp³ + sp²) ratio is consistent with that of the AD/AG ratio obtained from Raman spectra. This also corroborates the XRD results, indicating that OMC and AC have higher defect densities, while XC-72, CNT, and G exhibit lower defect densities. Previous studies have shown that inherent defects on the carbon surface enhance the metal-support interaction, which not only facilitates the anchoring of metal NPs but also modifies the electronic structure of the NPs, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance [30]. Therefore, we hypothesize that Pd NPs supported on OMC and AC will exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity. To further elucidate the mechanism by which surface defects on carbon supports enhance metal-support interactions, we performed deconvolution analysis of the Pd 3d spectra for a series of Pd/C catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3b, for Pd/AC, the binding energies are located at 334.83 eV (3d₅/₂) and 340.19 eV (3d₃/₂), corresponding to the Pd⁰ species; while the binding energies at 335.22 eV (3d₅/₂) and 341.38 eV (3d₃/₂) correspond to the characteristic peaks of Pd²⁺. Furthermore, we observed that the peak positions shift with changes in the catalyst support. Notably, as the defect density of carbon increases in the Pd/C catalysts, the Pd 3d binding energies shift to higher values. Compared to Pd/G, which has the lowest defect density, the Pd 3d₅/₂ peak binding energies for Pd/AC and Pd/OMC shift by 0.31 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. This shift indicates that the intrinsic defects in the carbon support enhance the metal-support interaction, promoting electron transfer from Pd NPs to the carbon support. Previous studies have shown that electron transfer from Pd NPs to the support generates a strong electric field on the electron-rich support, which, on one hand, facilitates the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby enhancing reaction activity; on the other hand, the generated electric field increases the local OH⁻ concentration around Pd, accelerating the oxidation of CO* and improving catalyst stability [24,31]. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Pd/OMC electrocatalyst are displayed in Fig. 4 (a–g). As can be observed, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) are predominantly deposited at the edge sites of the carbon support (Fig. 4, d–g). Statistical analysis of the particle size distribution reveals that the average diameter of Pd NPs anchored on Pd/OMC-900 is approximately 5.8 nm (Fig. 4b). A magnified view of the edge region in Fig. 4b is presented in Fig. 4c for further analysis. Although OMC consists of amorphous carbon lacking long-range crystallographic order, short-range nominal interlayer spacing with an average value of 0.39 nm is identified, which is larger than the interlayer distance of graphene (0.34 nm). This observation suggests that the edge defects in OMC primarily originate from the expansion of carbon lattices induced by elevated calcination temperatures. Furthermore, lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm are measured, corresponding to the (111) plane of Pd NPs, consistent with XRD results. These findings demonstrate that Pd NPs are uniformly anchored near the edge defects of OMC, which may enhance the EMSI between OMC and Pd NPs. This interaction could modulate the electronic structure and d-band center of Pd NPs, thereby improving their catalytic performance. To further confirm the role of the carbon support in promoting the dispersion of Pd NPs, we performed TEM characterization. As shown in Figure S6, Pd NPs are evenly distributed on AC, CNT, G, and OMC. However, significant agglomeration of Pd NPs is observed on AC, G, and CNT. The particle size distribution histogram reveals that Pd NPs supported on G have the largest size (∼20 nm). This is partly attributed to the limited pore structure and surface area of G, which are insufficient to provide effective adsorption sites for Pd NPs. Additionally, the limited defect density on its surface hinders the nucleation and anchoring of Pd NPs. Although Pd NPs on XC-72 have the smallest size (∼5.83 nm), their dispersion is relatively poor. In contrast, Pd NPs supported on OMC exhibit excellent dispersion with small particle size. This maximizes the utilization of active sites and significantly enhances reaction activity. Moreover, when the metal nanoparticle size is large, the support's anchoring ability weakens, making it prone to leaching during the reaction, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. When the support is consistent, its anchoring ability for smaller metal nanoparticles is stronger, which contributes to the long-term stability of the electrocatalyst [32]. The electrocatalytic performance of a series of Pd/C catalysts was evaluated in a three-electrode system. First, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV·s⁻¹ in 1.0 M KOH solution saturated with N₂ (Fig. 5 a). Integration of the hydrogen desorption region in the CV curve yielded the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts [33], with the resulting data presented in Table S3. ECSA refers to the active surface area of the electrode that can participate in electrochemical reactions, which reflects the number of active sites involved in the electrocatalytic process. As shown in Table S3, the ECSA of the Pd/C catalysts follows the order: Pd/OMC > Pd/AC > Pd/G > Pd/XC-72 > Pd/CNT. This is because the ordered mesoporous structure of OMC significantly optimizes the number of active sites, thus enhancing reaction activity. CV testing in N₂-saturated 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M CH₃OH was also conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV·s⁻¹, and the reaction activity of all electrocatalysts was normalized by mass. The results are shown in Fig. 5b and Table S3. Notably, ICP-OES results reveal that among the series of Pd/C catalysts, Pd/OMC exhibits the highest Pd loading (18.43 wt %), attributable to the large specific surface area and ordered pore structure of OMC, which provide abundant anchoring sites for Pd species (Table S4). The Pd/OMC catalyst demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation. Additionally, as summarized in Table S5, a comparative analysis of the alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) performance between the synthesized Pd/OMC and other carbon-supported electrocatalysts reveals that Pd/OMC exhibits superior catalytic activity. This finding underscores the critical role of the ordered mesoporous carbon architecture in enhancing MOR efficiency. Pd/OMC exhibited a more negative onset potential (Fig. 5c), suggesting enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) kinetics. This improvement is mainly ascribed to its ordered mesoporous structure, which significantly promotes mass transport during the electrochemical process. Furthermore, we conducted linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements on three catalysts with comparable performance: Pd/OMC, Pd/CNT, and Pd/AC. The corresponding Tafel slopes derived from these measurements (Figure S7) provide additional evidence for the enhanced reaction kinetics of Pd/OMC. The stability of the Pd/C catalysts was evaluated using chronopotentiometry (Fig. 5d). Initially, all samples exhibited a sharp drop in current density, which then stabilized over time. This decrease is mainly due to the chemical adsorption of carbonaceous intermediates on the catalyst surface during the reaction, leading to catalyst poisoning [34]. Furthermore, the consumption of methanol at the catalyst surface decreases the methanol concentration, further reducing catalyst activity [35,36]. More importantly, as the reaction progresses, the defect density on the carbon support decreases, leading to insufficient anchoring of active sites, which further diminishes reaction activity. Therefore, Pd NPs supported on G and CNT, which exhibit higher graphitization, show better stability, but their electrocatalytic activity is lower. Thus, balancing the degree of graphitization and defect density in catalysts to achieve both high activity and good stability remains a major challenge. To further evaluate the electron transfer kinetics of the Pd/C catalysts, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5e) reveal semicircular arcs, where the diameter corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode-electrolyte interface. A smaller arc diameter indicates faster electron transfer kinetics, which is critical for enhancing electrocatalytic reactions. Among the tested catalysts, Pd/G and Pd/CNT exhibited significantly smaller Rct values compared to Pd/AC and Pd/XC-72. This reduced charge transfer resistance can be attributed to their higher degree of graphitization, which improves electrical conductivity and facilitates efficient electron transport during the catalytic process. Graphitized carbon materials possess a well-ordered sp2-hybridized carbon network, enabling delocalized π-electrons to move freely, thereby lowering interfacial resistance. To investigate the rapid deactivation of the Pd/OMC catalyst, we assessed the CO poisoning resistance of Pd/G and Pd/OMC using CO stripping voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 4f and g, Pd/OMC exhibits a more negative CO oxidation potential (−0.368 V) compared to the more stable Pd/G catalyst (−0.321 V), indicating that Pd/OMC has a stronger ability to oxidize CO. Therefore, we infer that the primary cause of the rapid deactivation of Pd/OMC is the instability of OMC, which is amorphous carbon. This structural instability leads to the loss of defect sites during prolonged reaction processes, causing Pd NPs to agglomerate and leach. To improve the long-term stability of the carbon support, a common approach is to increase its graphitization degree, enhancing the support's resistance to corrosion under long-term operational conditions. However, this approach inevitably results in the loss of some defects, leading to a decrease in activity. Intrinsic defects on the carbon support surface play a crucial role in improving both the activity and stability of electrocatalysts. On the one hand, inherent defects can effectively tune the electronic structure of metal nanoparticles, improving the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, thereby enhancing activity. On the other hand, inherent defects anchor metal particles, preventing the dissolution or leaching of active sites during long-term reactions. Inherent defects are typically quantified using the AD/AG ratio from Raman spectroscopy and the sp³/sp²+sp³ ratio from XPS. Correlating these values with the catalyst's activity, as shown in Fig. 5h and i, reveals a strong correlation between the electrocatalyst’s activity and these two values. Therefore, further enhancing the intrinsic defect density on the OMC surface to improve reaction activity while enhancing stability is a feasible route. Further analyses (Fig. S6) revealed that Pd/OMC displayed a smaller impedance arc diameter and a more negative Tafel slope, indicative of faster electron transfer and improved reaction kinetics. Furthermore, accelerated durability testing (ADT) was performed on the Pd/OMC electrocatalyst, as shown in Figure S8, which retained 68 % of its initial activity after 500 CV cycles, demonstrating superior stability in alkaline media. ATR-IR measurements were performed, as shown in Fig. 6 . Infrared signals were recorded in an N₂-saturated 1.0 M CH₃OH + 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at various applied potentials. Fig. 5a and b show the initiation of methanol electro-oxidation at potentials above −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl. A stretching vibration of C = O in the intermediate CH₂O* was observed at approximately 1730 cm⁻¹, associated with methanol dehydrogenation [37–39]. Notably, the presence of adsorbed CO species (CO*) was observed on the surface of the Pd/G catalyst. The strong adsorption of CO on Pd is one of the main causes of catalyst deactivation [40]. Excitingly, no CO species linearly bonded to Pd were observed on the Pd/OMC surface. Furthermore, one intense peaks at 1618 cm⁻¹ were observed, corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of O = C O in HCOOH*, indicating the formation of formate intermediates [31,41]. These observations suggest that the MOR pathway on the Pd/OMC surface favors the formate pathway, effectively avoiding catalyst deactivation due to CO poisoning. Our previous study have systematically elucidated the distinct MOR pathways mediated by defective carbon and graphitic carbon substrates [20]. For the Pd-G system, the rate-limiting step is identified as H₂C(OH)O* → HCOOH* (energy barrier: 1.86 eV), whereas for Pd-Gₑdge, the methanol deprotonation step (CH₃OH → CH₂OH, 1.52 eV) constitutes the kinetic bottleneck. In the competitive CO pathway, formaldehyde dehydrogenation to CHO* is thermodynamically unfavorable on Pd-Gₑdge but relatively favorable on Pd-G, with the Gibbs free energy of this pathway exceeding that of the formate route via H₂C(OH)O*. These results suggest that carbon defect sites preferentially promote the formate pathway, consistent with the absence of CO* signals in FT-IR spectra. Prior studies on Pd-based catalysts have demonstrated that while surface CO* species may form, their subsequent conversion to CO₂* in the presence of COOH* intermediates enhanced long-term catalytic stability. Our findings reveal that Pd-Gₑdge thermodynamically favors H₂C(OH)O* deprotonation to HCOO*, while the formation of CHO*—and consequently CO*—is energetically disfavored compared to HCOO*. 4 Conclusion In this study, we first prepared the ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) support using a nanocasting method and synthesized the electrocatalyst (Pd/OMC) using a simple chemical reduction method. After comparing with a series of commercial carbon supports, we found that OMC not only facilitates mass transport during the reaction and enhances reaction kinetics, but also effectively tunes the electronic structure of Pd NPs through its surface-rich intrinsic defects, promoting electron transfer from Pd NPs to the support. The results of DFT calculation combined with ATR-IR spectroscopy show that, the electron-deficient Pd NPs likely enhance the reaction performance by promoting the adsorption and activation of reactants and carbonaceous intermediates, as well as facilitating CO oxidation. However, because OMC is amorphous carbon, its structural instability during prolonged reactions leads to significant loss of active sites, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation. Therefore, addressing the \"trade-off\" relationship between defects and graphitization degree (activity and stability) in electrocatalysts presents a major challenge. To further improve the stability of the electrocatalyst, two strategies should be pursued: (1) increase the graphitization degree of the carbon support to maximize stability while minimizing activity loss; and (2) engineer defects in the support to further enhance the defect density, strengthen the anchoring of active sites, and improve electrocatalytic performance.

        "dc:description": "In this study, carbon materials with ordered mesoporous structures (OMC) were used as supports for metal palladium (Pd). Using the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction as a probe reaction, a series of Pd/C catalysts supported on traditional carbon materials, such as graphene (G), carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon black (XC-72), and activated carbon (AC), were compared. Theoretical calculation predicted the promotion effect of defective carbon carrier on the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The electrocatalytic methanol oxidation performance of the Pd/OMC catalyst is significantly enhanced, with its methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity increasing by 1.9, 1.7, 1.5, and 1.4 times compared to Pd nanoparticles (NPs) catalysts supported on G, CNT, XC-72, and AC, respectively. Raman spectroscopy combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results revealed that the superior electrocatalytic performance of Pd/OMC was attributed to its higher intrinsic defect density, which enhanced the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). This interaction facilitated electron transfer from Pd NPs to the support, and the electron-deficient Pd NPs further boosted the electrocatalytic reaction performance.",
