Graphical abstract Highly-dispersed nickel-based catalysts (NiMgAlO-op) were prepared from NiMgAl layered double hydroxide precursors with various Ni/Mg/Al molar ratios via a one pot method. The obtained catalyst with a Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25 was highly active and selective for benzylamine (90.6%) in benzonitrile hydrogenation, mainly owing to the well dispersed Ni nanoparticles and its proper acid-base property. Notably, it showed good stability with negligible loss of activity for up to 10 runs. H2-TPD and TEM results indicated that the Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were well dispersed on support with extremely small size (about 3.3 nm), accounting for its excellent catalytic activity. In addition, the strong metal-support interaction in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, as confirmed by H2-TPR and XPS, can inhibit the leaching or aggregation of the small Ni nanoparticles during benzonitrile hydrogenation and account for its good stability, with no appreciable aggregation being observed after recycling. Keywords Hydrogenation Benzonitrile Nickel Layered double hydroxide Stability 1 Introduction As we know, excellent stability is one of the essential requirements for industrial catalysts. Thus, many researchers have attempted to promote the catalyst stability [1,2]. Loading the active species on some supports is believed to be a good method to improve the stability of catalysts. However, conventional supported catalysts prepared by the impregnation method usually face two problems: poor distribution of the active species on support and weak interaction between the active species and support [3,4]. These problems usually result in aggregation of the active species and decrease the catalytic efficiency during reactions. During the catalysts preparation, addition of some polymers (e.g. polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol) can endow the catalysts a better stability due to the increased stabilization of the active species and the suppression of aggregation by polymers [5–7]. Another approach is the sol-immobilization method, which needs to synthesize sols by some ligand molecules or surfactants. This method could minimize the formation of large nanoparticles and realize a homogeneous distribution of the catalytic species [4,8]. Yet, addition of polymers and the synthesis of sols could markedly increase the cost of catalysts. Moreover, once the active species have been deposited on supports, the presence of polymers or sol ligand molecules usually influences detrimentally on their catalytic performance [9,10]. The common methods for the removal of polymers and sol ligand molecules are thermal and oxidative treatments, which could extensively change the size and morphology of the active species, and thus decrease their catalytic performance [9,11]. Therefore, it is desirable to prepare stable supported catalysts without polymers and sols. In recent years, selective hydrogenation of nitriles has aroused special attention as an important method to produce primary amines because of its green and atom-economic intrinsic character [12–14]. Some noble metal (e.g. Rh, Pd and Pt) catalysts have shown good catalytic performance in nitrile hydrogenation [13,15,16], but the high costs of noble metals go against their further industrial applications. Alternatively, some nickel-based catalysts, especially Raney Ni and Ni-Co multi-metal catalysts, could be used in the hydrogenation of nitriles [17–20], as well as in the transformation of alcohols to primary amines or nitriles [21–23]. However, Raney Ni shows low mechanical strength and poor regeneration capability, although it has good catalytic activity and selectivity [24]. Moreover, Ni-Co multi-metal catalysts increase the cost of nickel-based catalysts as Co is more expensive than Ni [20]. In addition, selectivity control is an important issue in the hydrogenation of nitriles [14,25]. Introducing some additives, such as CH3COOH and NH3, are common techniques to improve the selectivity of primary amine [26]. But the homogeneous systems are not environmentally friendly, because the additives are hard to be separated from the products and recycled, which is a serious drawback for industrial applications. Nickel nanoparticles deposited on different supports were also investigated in the hydrogenation of nitriles and their selectivity to primary amines were still not very high (˜80%, Table S1). Thus, considering the scant reports on the high selectivity to primary amine (> 90%)and good stability of nickel-based catalysts [27–29], it is crucial to prepare stable nickel-based catalysts with good selectivity to primary amine for nitrile hydrogenation without using any additives. Increasing the interactions between the active species and supports is believed as one of the most effective ways to increase the stability of supported catalysts [30,31]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have a key structural feature that the M2+ and M3+ cations are homogeneously distributed on the layers [4]. Introducing catalytically metal nanoparticles (e.g. Ru, Ni and Cu) into the layers of LDHs has led to the development of new approaches to fabricate highly-dispersed supported catalysts [32–34]. Stable supported metal catalysts can be obtained from the LDH precursors after subsequent calcination and reduction. For example, Tomishige and co-workers prepared supported Ni-Fe/MgAl mixed metal oxide catalyst from the LDH precursor, in which the active Ni-Fe alloy interacted strongly with the support [35]. The strong interaction suppresses the migration or sintering of the metal nanoparticles during the reaction and thus achieves an outstanding stability of the catalyst [36]. Recently, we have fabricated two nickel-based core–shell catalysts from LDHs, which can be tuned by an interesting “water switch” and afford benzylamine and N-benzylidenebenzylamine, respectively [37]. However, the low selectivity for benzylamine and poor stability are serious drawbacks for their industrial applications. In a continuing attempt to achieve a higher selectivity and better stability, we herein developed some novel supported catalysts (NiMgAlO-op) with highly-dispersed Ni nanoparticles via a one pot method, which showed excellent catalytic performance in benzonitrile hydrogenation. Notably, their alkalinities increased with the increase of Mg content, resulting in a high selectivity for benzylamine while the Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio being 1:0.75:0.25. Furthermore, NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op revealed good stability in benzonitrile hydrogenation, much better than the impregnation catalyst Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and other nickel-based catalysts reported in the literatures (Table S1). The correlations between the structures and different catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts in benzonitrile selective hydrogenation were clarified. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Nickel nitrate hexahydrate and urea were supplied by Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Factory. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate were purchased from Tianjin Fu Chen Chemical Reagent Factory. Benzonitrile was supplied by Jiaxing Jiaya Reagents Co., Ltd. 10 vol% H2/Ar, CO2 and ultrapure Ar (99.999%) were purchased from Baoding Zhuoda Gas Co. Ltd. These chemicals were used as received without any pre-treatment. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts NiMgAlO-op catalysts were derived from layered double hydroxide precursors with various Ni:Mg:Al molar ratios by an urea hydrolysis method [38], as shown in Scheme 1 . In a typical run, nitrates of Ni2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ ([Ni2+]:[Mg2+]:[Al3+] = 1:0.75:0.25) were dissolved in 200 mL of H2O, followed by the addition of urea ([urea]:[NO3 −] = 4) with stirring under ambient conditions. The mixed solution was heated to boiling for 5 h before cooling down. The obtained green solid was isolated, washed by using deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 333 K for 6 h. For convenience, the resulted NiMgAl-LDH precursor was denoted as NiMg0.75Al0.25-LDH. Other NiMgAl-LDH precursors were fabricated using the same method by changing the Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio. After calcination of the NiMgAl-LDH precursors at 773 K in muffle furnace for 2 h, the catalysts were produced in hydrogen flow at 723 K for 2 h. The resulted catalysts were labeled as NiAlO-op, NiMg0.5Al0.5O-op, NiMg0.67Al0.33O-op, NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and NiMg0.8Al0.2O-op, respectively. The impregnation catalyst Ni/MgAlO-imp was used as reference sample [39]. The MgAl-LDH support ([Mg2+]:[Al3+] = 0.75:0.25) was prepared by the same method of the NiMgAlO-op catalysts. The obtained Mg0.75Al0.25-LDH was impregnated in a Ni(NO3)2·6H2O solution ([Ni2+]:[Mg2++Al3+] = 1) under sonication for 30 min. Then it was kept at 333 K for 6 h. Finally, the catalyst was produced by the same calcination and reduction process as above. The obtained catalyst was denoted as Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp. 2.3 Characterization Inductively coupled plasma analysis was carried out to identify the Ni/Mg/Al mole ratios of catalysts using an Agilent 7700 × spectrometer (ICP-OES). In-situ FTIR was performed by using Nicolet iS10 spectrometer coupled with a flexible infrared fiber-optic probe. Bruker D8 diffractometer was applied to acquire the wide-angle and small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts using Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 100 mA. The morphologies of the catalysts were acquired on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope. The nitrogen physisorption was carried out in liquid nitrogen to obtain the surface areas, pore sizes, and pore volumes of the nickel-based catalysts using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 apparatus. H2-pulse chemisorption was measured by a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 to determine the surface area and dispersion of the active metal nanoparticles. Before tests, catalysts were reduced under H2 flow at 723 K for 2 h and pretreatment in Ar flow at 473 K for 1 h. This Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument was also used to record the H2-chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (H2-TPD) and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to record the binding energies of Ni using a PHI 1600 spectrometer. Before XPS measurement, the fresh catalyst was stored in ethanol to avoid oxidization by air and it was filtered to get dry sample for XPS measurement. C1s peak of the adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV was used to correct the binding energies. 2.4 Catalytic tests Benzonitrile selective hydrogenation was carried out in a 50 mL Parr 4848 stainless steel autoclave. An electric heating system was used to control the requisite temperature and the stirring speed was tuned by a mechanical stirrer. First of all, 1.0 mL benzonitrile, 0.1 g catalyst, and 30 mL methanol were sequentially added. Then, the residual air was expelled from the autoclave by filling and evacuating three times with H2. H2 was charged into the autoclave to achieve 4.0 MPa after the autoclave was heated to 373 K. Hydrogenation then performed for 2 h with vigorous stirring. After the autoclave was cooled down, gas chromatography was applied to analyze the reaction solution using a 30 m HP-5 capillary column. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to verify the structures of reaction products on an Agilent 5975C spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening of catalysts As can be seen, Ni, Mg and Al molar ratios of the obtained nickel-based catalysts are close to their actual values (Table 1 ). Selective hydrogenation of benzonitrile was then used to evaluate their catalytic performances. It was found that all of the catalysts derived from layered double hydroxide precursors showed high activity for benzonitrile selective hydrogenation. However, the selectivity for benzylamine was only 79.7% for NiAlO-op. Considering the influence of acid-base properties [4], a variety of catalysts with various Mg contents were fabricated and compared. As can be seen, the selectivity for benzylamine first increased and then slightly decreased with the increase of Mg content, and a catalyst with a Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25 showed the best selectivity for benzylamine (90.6%). The effects of H2 pressures and reaction temperatures on the catalytic performances of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were also evaluated (Table S2). Obviously, the conversion of benzonitrile and the selectivity for benzylamine were both optimal under 4.0 MPa H2 pressure and 373 K reaction temperature. As we know, some additives have been employed to promote the yield of primary amine [26], but these additives have some serious drawbacks, such as not environmentally friendly and difficulty in separation. In this work, the optimal selectivity for primary amine was much higher than all the nickel-based catalysts (without addition of any additive) and only a little lower than those with some additives and some noble-metal catalysts (Table S1). In contrast, the selectivity for benzylamine was only 52.1% over the impregnation catalyst Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp, although the conversion of benzonitrile (96.7%) was similar to that of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. The TOF values of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp were 4954 and 1263 h−1, respectively, suggesting that NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op has better catalytic activity. Notably, the TOF value of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op was obviously higher than those of the nickel-based catalysts reported in the literatures and even slightly higher than a noble metal catalyst Pd/MCM-41 (4151 h−1) (Table S1). To investigate the interaction between benzonitrile and the catalyst, in situ FTIR spectroscopy has been carried out (Fig. 1 ) [40–43]. Considering that the original catalytic tests were performed with more solvent, we increased benzonitrile content to improve the IR signal intensity. Generally, the characteristic FTIR vibrations at 2220–2260 and 1650–1580 cm−1 are the CN bond for nitriles and NH bond for primary amines, respectively. As can be seen (Fig. 1), benzonitrile was converted over NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, together with the formation of benzylamine. Furthermore, the benzonitrile conversion rate was similar to the benzylamine formation rate, suggesting that most of benzonitrile was converted to benzylamine and the formation of by-products, mainly from the condensation between the imine intermediate and benzylamine, was markedly suppressed over NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, in line with the catalytic results (Table 1). Considering stability is an essential feature for industrial catalysts, the stabilities of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp were evaluated (Fig. 2 ). As can be seen, NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op showed excellent catalytic stability in benzonitrile hydrogenation with negligible loss of conversion and only 0.9% drop of benzylamine selectivity within 10 runs. In contrast, Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp showed poor stability with the conversion of benzonitrile being drastically dropped from 96.7% to 40.4% only within 5 runs, together with 17.8% drop of benzylamine selectivity. Thus, NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op was regarded as the optimal catalyst. Generally, the catalytic performance of supported catalysts could be influenced by several factors, such as particle size, active species dispersion, nature of support, and the interaction between the active species and the support [4]. Therefore, certain characterizations were carried out to reveal the underlying causes for the different performances of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp in benzonitrile selective hydrogenation. 3.2 Characterization of catalysts Wide-angle XRD patterns of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and their precursors are shown in Fig. 3 , Fig. S1, and Fig. S2. Obviously, all the LDH precursors revealed characteristic peaks of LDH at 2θ = 11.3°, 22.7°, 34.5°, 38.8°, 46.3°, 60.1° and 61.8° (Fig. S1) [44], suggesting the formation of the LDH materials. The disappearance of the LDH peaks in the calcined samples (Fig. S2), accompanied by the emergence of the characteristic peaks of NiO and mixed metallic oxides (NiAl2O4 and MgNiO2), indicated the transformation of LDH to the corresponding metallic oxides during calcination. Furthermore, all the reduced samples showed characteristic peaks at 2θ = 44.3°, 51.8° and 76.4° (Fig. 3), which belong to Ni0 [45], demonstrating the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0. Notably, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni0 in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp are much sharper than those in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, suggesting larger particle size of Ni0 in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp [46]. Furthermore, for Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, the diffraction peaks at 43.5° and 62.5° were still retained while they were reduced at 873 K, but almost disappeared while they were reduced at 1123 K (Fig. S3). It indicated that these two diffraction peaks at 43.5° and 62.5° belonged to MgNiO2 instead of NiO, because MgNiO2 was difficult to be reduced below 1000 K [47,48]. On the other hand, small-angle XRD patterns of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp both had a sharp diffraction peak at about 2θ = 0.38° (Fig. 3, inset), suggesting their long range ordered structures [49]. According to the previous literatures [26,50], nitrile hydrogenation yields primary amine in two steps: nitrile is first hydrogenated to primary imine, a partially hydrogenated intermediate with high reactivity, and then to primary amine. An imine could react with a primary amine to yield a Schiff base intermediate, which would afford a secondary amine after further hydrogenation. The transamination between primary amine and imine is a key process to form secondary amine and a NH3 molecule is produced during this step (Scheme S1). Thus, the surface acid sites of catalysts would be mainly responsible for the transamination reaction to secondary amine. On the other hand, imine intermediates and primary amines are both basic species and tend to interact with acidic sites than basic sites [50]. Therefore, adjusting the acid-base property of the catalyst will significantly affect the selectivity of primary amine [15]. Thus, by introducing Mg with different contents, the intrinsic acid-base properties of the catalysts were modified to tune the selectivity of primary amine. The basicity of these catalysts was then evaluated by CO2-TPD (Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). According to the CO2-TPD profiles (Fig. 4), there are weak, moderate and strong basic sites in the nickel-based catalysts. The CO2 adsorption capacity of catalyst is in connection with the amount of basic sites and specific surface area [51]. As can be seen in Table 2, NiAlO-op had the lowest basicity than the other one pot catalysts probably due to the acidic nature of aluminum [52]. With the increase of the Mg content, the weak basicity of catalysts increased. The moderate and strong basicity of catalysts also changed and showed the highest value for NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. In contrast, the specific surface area decreased with the increase of Mg/Al ratio [51]. Thus, in combination with the change of Mg content and surface area, the total basicity of the one pot catalysts were first increased and then decreased, in line with the previous report [51]. Compared with NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp has much smaller surface area (Table S3), which results in its lower basicity, although they have similar Mg/Al ratio. The high basicity of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op will suppress the unwanted condensation reaction between benzylimine and benzylamine [37], and in turn improve the selectivity for benzylamine. Moreover, the basic property may restrain the adsorption of basic imine intermediates and primary amines to prevent coke deposition on catalysts during nitrile hydrogenation, resulting in good stability [53]. Ni loadings, H2-chemisorptions, metal dispersions, metallic surface areas and TOF values of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp are shown in Table 3 . Apparently, the Ni loading of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op only dropped from 48.4% to 46.0% after 10 runs (0.24% per run); whereas the Ni loading of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp dropped from 54.1% to 42.0% within 5 runs (2.42% per run), indicating that the one pot method favors the immobilization of the active Ni species in brucite-like layers and suppresses their loss during benzonitrile hydrogenation, accounting for the good stability of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. Furthermore, NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op revealed markedly larger H2-chemisorption, metal dispersion, metallic surface area and TOF value than Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp, suggesting NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op having more active sites and higher activity. It also showed larger surface area and pore volume than Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp (Table S3), owing to its efficient preparation method and well dispersed active species, in good agreement with its higher activity. Notably, these physicochemical properties of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op only slightly changed after 10 runs, whereas the BET surface area (Table S3), H2-chemisorption, metal dispersion and metallic surface area of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp markedly decreased after only 5 runs, further demonstrating the good stability of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. In addition, both NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp showed standard IV isotherms and H3-type hysteresis loops (Fig. S4) [55], demonstrating these two catalysts having a mesoporous structure and in line with the small-angle XRD result (Fig. 3, inset). Generally, the desorption peak areas in H2-TPD are in consistent with the amounts of active sites for hydrogenation [56]. Thus, H2-TPD was carried out to evaluate the hydrogenation ability of NiAlO-op, NiMgAlO-op and Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp (Fig. 5 ). As can be seen, all one pot nickel-based catalysts showed one main desorption peak at about 350–450 K. With the increase of the Mg content, the desorption temperature was decreased slightly. NiMg0.8Al0.2O-op had two desorption peaks at 360 and 401 K, suggesting two active sites [49]. NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op had the largest desorption peak at 391 K among all the one pot catalysts studied, together with a weak desorption peak at around 904 K (Fig. 5d), indicating the appearance of abundant and uniform active sites at Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25. In contrast, Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp showed two small desorption peaks at approximately 430 and 858 K (Fig. 5f). Notably, the desorption peaks of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were much larger than those of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp, demonstrating the existence of more active sites in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. Furthermore, the largest desorption peak of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op emerged at a lower temperature than that of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp, indicating the adsorption of hydrogen on well dispersed Ni nanoparticles [57]. Therefore, the abundant active sites and high Ni dispersion of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op resulted in its excellent catalytic activity and in line with the H2-chemisorption and metal dispersion results (Table 3). TEM images of the fresh and used catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 . As can be seen, all Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were well dispersed with an average size of 3.3 nm (Fig. 6a). While Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp showed poor dispersion of the Ni particles with a much bigger particle size of 14.7 nm (Fig. 6c), in line with the wide-angle XRD (Fig. 3) and the metal dispersion results (Table 3). The small size and high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op lead to its high catalytic activity. Furthermore, the Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op-Used were also homogeneously dispersed with an average size of 3.7 nm after 10 runs (Fig. 6b), indicating that NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op kept stable during hydrogenation and in consistent with the stability result (Fig. 2). Arising from the structural characteristic of LDH and the one pot preparation method [4,36], the strong metal-support interaction can restrain the migration of Ni nanoparticles during hydrogenation. However, the Ni nanoparticles in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp markedly aggregated with the average particle size being increased from 14.7 to 22.7 nm after only 5 runs (Fig. 6d), suggesting that the active Ni species interacted weakly with the support. As well known, strong metal-support interaction is crucial to stabilize small nanoparticles. Then the interaction between the Ni nanoparticles and the support was explored by H2-TPR. TPR profiles of the one pot and impregnation catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 . Generally, the reduction peak of bulk NiO or free NiO is below 673 K [57], whereas the reduction peak of NiO, which interacts strongly with supports, moves to a markedly higher reduction temperature [57,58]. As for the one pot catalysts, their reduction peaks changed with the increase of the Mg content and the highest reduction temperature (868 K) was achieved at a Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25 (Fig. 7d), indicating that NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op has stronger interaction than catalysts with other Ni:Mg:Al molar ratios. In contrast, Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp had two reduction peaks at 694 and 1001 K (Fig. 7f). The peak at 694 K was ascribed to the reduction of the bulk NiO, which interacted weakly with the support [59]. The high temperature reduction peak at 1001 K was assigned to the reduction of spinel-like phase (NiAl2O4 and MgNiO2 spinels), which was difficult to be reduced during the catalyst preparation process [47,48]. As can be seen, one large reduction peak at 868 K was observed for NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op (Fig. 7d), owing to the reduction of the well dispersed NiO, which interacted strongly with the support [60]. The strong interaction between metal and support could suppress migration and aggregation of Ni nanoparticles and lead to good catalytic stability of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op. Whereas, in the case of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp, only the NiO that interacted weakly with the support can be reduced during the catalyst preparation, which was easy to aggregate during benzonitrile hydrogenation, resulting in its poor stability. XPS spectra of Ni 2p3/2 in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op are shown in Fig. 8 . In general, the binding energies of metallic Ni and NiO are about 852.4 ± 0.4 and 854.0 ± 0.4 eV, respectively [61–63]. The Ni 2p3/2 spectra of the reduced Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op presented three states of nickel: metallic Ni, simple metal oxide and spinel phase, as also confirmed by the XRD results. Notably, NiO was mainly formed by the oxidation of metallic Ni upon air exposure before XPS analysis [64]. The peaks at 855.88 (Fig. 8a) and 856.12 eV (Fig. 8b) were assigned to Ni2+ ions within spinel structure, such as NiAl2O4 and MgNiO2 [65]. Obviously, the binding energies of Ni (852.53 eV), NiO (854.78 eV) and spinel nickel (856.12 eV) in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were all higher than those in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp (852.21, 854.28 and 855.88 eV, respectively). Furthermore, the binding energy shift between Ni nanoparticles of Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp and NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op was 0.32 eV, much larger than the binding energy shift caused by particle size effect (0.12 eV) [66,67]. Thus, it was demonstrated that the Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op interacted more strongly with the support than those in Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp [56,68], in consistent with the H2-TPR results. This can confine the nanoparticle migration and weaken surface energy to improve its catalytic stability during the hydrogenation process. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a well-dispersed and stable nickel-based catalyst NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op was successfully prepared in this work. It showed excellent catalytic activity, selectivity and stability in benzonitrile selective hydrogenation, much better than the impregnation catalyst Ni/Mg0.75Al0.25O-imp. As for the NiMgAlO-op catalysts, their basicity and their selectivity for benzylamine increased with the increase of Mg content and reached 90.6% with a molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25. The small Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were well dispersed, accounting for its good activity. XPS and H2-TPR results demonstrated the presence of strong metal-support interaction in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, which suppresses the leaching or aggregation of the small Ni nanoparticles in benzonitrile hydrogenation, resulting in outstanding stability. Notably, the facile preparation method and superior catalytic performance of NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op make it a good candidate for large-scale industrial applications.

        "dc:description": "Highly-dispersed nickel-based catalysts (NiMgAlO-op) were prepared from NiMgAl layered double hydroxide precursors with various Ni/Mg/Al molar ratios via a one pot method. The obtained catalyst with a Ni:Mg:Al molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25 was highly active and selective for benzylamine (90.6%) in benzonitrile hydrogenation, mainly owing to the well dispersed Ni nanoparticles and its proper acid-base property. Notably, it showed good stability with negligible loss of activity for up to 10 runs. H2-TPD and TEM results indicated that the Ni nanoparticles in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op were well dispersed on support with extremely small size (about 3.3 nm), accounting for its excellent catalytic activity. In addition, the strong metal-support interaction in NiMg0.75Al0.25O-op, as confirmed by H2-TPR and XPS, can inhibit the leaching or aggregation of the small Ni nanoparticles during benzonitrile hydrogenation and account for its good stability, with no appreciable aggregation being observed after recycling.",
