Curie, 4 Place Jussieu 75252, Paris Cedex 05 (France) (Received June 19,1989; accepted October 2,1989) Summary Molybdenum hexacarbonyl was admitted onto chromia-silica catalysts prepared both by reduction in CO, which produces Cr(II)-rich samples, and by reduction in hydrogen, which produces Cr( III)-rich samples. Cr(II) OC MoCCOs and Cr(III) OC Mo(CO)5 adducts are formed whose infrared spectral features, particularly the stretching mode of the 0-bonded CO entity, depend on the charge of the cation and on its coordination. Mo(CO)6 species physisorbed on the support are also observed. These results are compared with previous results relative to molybdenum/silica catalysts. Introduction There are several reasons for interest in the study of metal carbonyl adsorption on oxides. One is the growing need for development of new techniques for the preparation of properly tailored catalysts containing well-dispersed metals and small metal clusters. Decarbonylation of metal carbonyls anchored on the surface of various supports may offer convenient routes to this goal, as indicated by the pioneering work of Howe et al. [1,2], Yermakov et al. [3], Brenner et al. [4], Ugo et al. [5] and Gugliehninotti et al. [G, 7]. A second reason is that immobilized carbonyls are very useful in the investigation of ligand substitution reactions [8] and catalytic reactions [9,10]. *Presented as a contributed paper at the 6th Int.

In these cases, complex distributions of metal sites are produced, which are very often investigated by the IR spectra of adsorbed CO. It was repeatedly found that some of the thus-formed surface species are polycar- bonyls whose structure is identical to the structure of the species produced when molecular polycarbonyl vapor is directly admitted onto the same support. One of the first observations of this kind was the formation of nickel tetracarbonyl when CO is admitted onto reduced Ni dispersed on MgO [11,12]. Similarly, it was found that Mo(CO)g was one of the most typical products obtained by CO adsorption on reduced Mo/SiOg catalysts. Such species were produced by erosion of small Mo metal particles and then anchored to coexisting Mo^ cations [13]. Relevant aspects of this system could not be fully understood due to the complexity of the metal surface phase. In fact, different Mo^ (5 ^ n & 3) cations were present, each produc- ing monocarbonyls whose IR absorptions were in the same region as the bands of the Mo(CO)e formed at the expense of the Mo particles. As a result, the overall IR spectrum of CO on Mo/SiOa was extremely complex. This prompted us to study the IR spectrum of Mo(CO)g adsorbed onto a simpler and better-characterized system, such as reduced chromia silica, where chromium is present essentially in the form of divalent cations Cr(II) [14]. Various families of such ions, however, have been recognized, having different coordination and, consequently, differing Lewis acidity. As the relative populations of the various types of chromium sites can be easily modified by proper pretreatment [14], this system offers the opportunity of testing the dependence of the IR spectrum of adsorbed Mo(CO)e on the acidity of the anchoring chromium site. Interestingly, these hetero-adduct surface species may also be regarded as precursors of bimetallic (Cr Mo) entities. Experimental The chromia-silica catalyst (Cr loading 0.5wt.%) was prepared by impregnation as reported in [15]. Two different activation procedures were adopted. S Sample The standard activation procedure for reduced samples [15] was: (a) outgassing 1 h at 1073 K (final pressure \"lO\"6 torr; 1 torr = 133 KNm~2); (b) oxidation (40 torr Oa) at 823 K for 30min; (c) reduction (40 torr CO) at 623 K for 30 min and (d) outgassing at 473 K for 30 min. These S samples are pale blue. 73 H Sample Somewhat different samples are obtained when Ha (150 ton\"; 873 K for 1 h) is used as the reducing agent in step (c) instead of CO. These H samples are pale green. The grafted Mo/SiOg catalyst (Mo loading 0.3wt.%) was prepared as reported in [13]. The activation steps were: (a) oxidation (200 ton\" Oa) for 2 h at 873 K and outgassing for 30 min at the same temperature; (b) reduction (200 ton\" Hg) at 873 K for 9 h and outgassing for 30min at the same temperature. Self-supporting pellets of the catalysts were placed into IR cells, which were permanently connected to vacuum lines (P 10~6 torr) and allowed all thermal treatments and adsorption-desorption experiments to be carried out in situ. The IR spectra in the 2250-1700 cm\"1 range are reported in the absorbance scale after subtraction of the background spectra of the pellets. The spectra were obtained with Perkin Elmer 580 B and Bruker IFS 113V instruments. High purity gases (Matheson) were used with no further purification except liquid nitrogen trapping. Mo(CO)g was obtained from Strem Chemicals. Results CO can provide detailed information on the coordination and oxidation states of the cations exposed on chromia-silica catalysts [14]. For this reason, after the reducing pretreatments and before adsorption of Mo(CO)e, the samples were tested by running IR spectra in the presence of 40 ton\" CO. The CO was then desorbed at 473 K and, finally, increasing doses of Mo(CO)s vapours were admitted onto the clean surface of the chromia silica catalysts. Mo(CO)e adsorption on chromia-silica (S sample) The inset in Fig. 1 shows the well-known [14] spectrum of CO adsorbed on a chromia-silica sample prereduced in CO. The most intense band is at 2183cm\"1, accompanied by a shoulder at 2177cm\"1 and a peak at 2191 cm~1. A weak and broader band is observed at 2101 cm~1. Curves a-e show that upon Mo(CO)e adsorption several bands appear, their intensities increasing with coverage. The spectra are dominated by a sharp peak at 2020 cm~1. A similar sharp, though weaker, peak appears at 1991 cm\"1. Other much weaker components are found at 2191, 2129, 2102 and 2056 cm~1. A complex absorption is at lower frequencies, with a broad maximum at 1841 cm~1, a heavy shoulder at 1813 cm\"! and a very weak and heavily overlapped one at \"1850-60 cm\"1. When carbon monoxide is admitted (Fig. 2) onto a sample with preadsorbed Mo(CO)e, the bands at 2020, 2056, 2129cm\"1 and the adsorp- tion at 1800-1900 cm~1 are much diminished, whereas the peak at 74 2200 2100 2000 1700 2200 2100 2000 1900 1800 ,1700 cm-1 1900 1800 cm-1 Fig. 1.

IR spectra of chromia-silica prereduced in CO (S Sample blue), (a): after adsorption of Mo(CO)g (the same as Fig. Ie); (b): following admission of CO (40 torr) on preadsorbed Mo(CO)g. Removal of CO by pumping off at beam temperature restored spectrum (a) and the cycle could be repeated indefinitely. 1991 cm\"1 becomes the most intense. At the same time, the bands due to CO adsorbed on chromium ions appear at high frequencies. These effects are completely reversible, as the spectrum in Fig. 2a is restored by mere evacuation of CO. Readmission of CO produces curve b, and the cycle may be repeated. Mo(CO)e adsorption on chromia-silica (H sample) Figure 3 compares the spectra of chromia-silica prereduced in CO (S sample blue, curve a) with the spectra of chromia-silica prereduced in hydrogen (H Sample green, curve b). The main differences may be summarized as follows: (1) CO adsorbed on the H sample produces a much simpler spectrum 75 2200 2100 2000 1900 1800 1700 ;0.03 005 2200 2100 2000 1900 1800 1700 crrr Fig. 3.

(2) The spectrum ofMo(CO)6 adsorbed on the H sample (Fig. 3b) shows one peak at 1855 cm~1 whereas the S sample shows three components (Fig. 3a) in the low frequency range; only very minor differences, if any, are observed in the high frequency bands ofMo(CO)e. The effect of adsorption of CO on the H sample with preadsorbed Mo(CO)6 is identical to that observed on the S sample (Fig. 2b), and will not be described further. Mo(CO)e adsorbed on Mo/SiOs sample Figure 4 compares the spectrum ofMo(CO)e adsorbed on chromia-silica (S sample, curve a) and the spectrum of Mo(CO)e adsorbed on a thermally reduced silica-supported molybdenum catalyst (curve b) [13]. It will be 76 noticed that the overall structures of the spectra are the same, but the low-frequency absorption in curve b ( 1775cm\"1) is at lower frequency than in curve a, whereas the high frequency ones are shifted in the opposite direction. Discussion The experiments in Figs. 1-3 indicate that the adsorption of Mo(CO)g on the various samples produces several sets of correlated bands, showing that somewhat dinerent multicarbonyl species are stabilized on the surfaces. Only two weak bands observed in Fig. 1 (curves a-e) at 2191 and 2102 cm\"1 are correlated neither with each other nor with other absorptions. Being in the same region as the bands produced by CO adsorption (Fig. 1, inset), they can be readily assigned to carbonyl species formed on anchored chromium ions. Their presence shows that some Mo(CO)e decomposes on the surface of chromia silica. The intensities of the 2191 and 2102 cm\"! bands, although increasing from curve a to e, are extremely weak, proving that the extent of dissociation at room temperature is very small. For this reason and because it is not linked to the main phenomena described in the following, the decomposition ofMo(CO)e will not be discussed further in this report. Structure of adsorbed species It is well documented [6-8, 13, 16-19] that the interaction of polycar- bonyls with the surfaces of oxides essentially produces two families of adsorbed species, which will be conventionally referred to as physisorbed (readily removed by mere pumping off at room temperature) and chemi- sorbed (mostly irreversible at room temperature). Chemisorbed -OC Mo(CO)s species Polycarbonyls may be chemisorbed via o-bonds between the basic oxygen [20] of a CO group and acidic metal cations (supported Cr and Mo ions in this case) of oxides to produce, with molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Me\"\"1\" OC Mo(CO)5 structures. The bridged CO exhibits the stretching mode in the 1700-1900 cm\"1 region and is no longer coupled to the remaining carbonyls, which constitute a vibrationally separate Mo(CO)6 entity showing C^y symmetry [17,20]. Four normal modes (2Ai, Bg and E) of the pentacarbonyl fragment are associated with vibrations in the high frequency region [16 20]. Only 2Ai and E modes are IR active, but the Bg mode is also most often observed in the IR spectra [21]. The dominant band is always associated with the E mode (at 2020 cm\"1 in Fig. 1), and the weak low frequency Ai band generally appears as a shoulder of (and often overshadowed by) such an intense companion. In Fig. 1, the high frequency Ai mode and the Bg mode are at 2129 and 2056 cm\"1 respectively. Similar bands due to chemisorbed species in Figs. 3 and 4 are easily recognizable and are listed in Table 1. 77 TABLE 1 Infrared bands (cm\"1) of adsorbed molybdenum hexacarbonyl\" OC Mo (00)5 Mo(CO)6 entity chemisorbed on 04,, symmetry 0-bonded CO (Ai)i 2129 2129 2129 2132 (Bg) (E) Cr(II)A CrdDa Cr(III) Mo54^ 2056 2020 1813 2056 2020 1841 2056 2020 1855 2088 2032 1775 The (Ai)z mode of the Mo(CO)5 entity is not resolved [17]. The T^ mode of Mo(CO)e physisorbed on SiOz is at 1990 cm\"1. Physisorbed Mo(CO)e Mo(CO)e may also interact very weakly with the support, preserving, though with a very slight distortion, octahedral symmetry. The band at 1991 cm\"1 in Figs. 1 4 is due to the Tiu CO stretching mode, the only IR-active one in the free molecule [16 20]. Due to the feeble perturbation induced by physisorption on the silica surface, the Aig and Eg modes become slightly active. In solution such weak bands are observed at 2112-2118 and 2018-2010 cm-1 [21]. Displacement of chemisorbed OC Mo(CO)s by CO The sets of bands due to chemisorbed and physisorbed Mo(CO)s are easily distinguishable thanks to the experiment recorded in Fig. 2. In fact, when CO is admitted onto preadsorbed hexacarbonyl, the bands of the chemisorbed species (1800-1900, 2020, 2056 and 2129cm-1 in curve a) are almost completely suppressed in favour of the bands due to the physisorbed species whose intensity greatly increases (1991 cm-1, in curve b). Interest- ingly, in Fig. 2b a weak absorption appears at ==2120 cm-1 together with a component at 2015 cm-1, which are certainly due to the somewhat distorted octahedral physisorbed species. The transformation of the OC Mo(CO)5 chemisorbed species into Mo(CO)e physisorbed ones when carbon monoxide is admitted in the cell is accompanied by the appearance of the bands of adsorbed CO. This proves that CO removes OC Mo(CO)5 from the chromium cations and takes its place, while the polycarbonyl is accommodated on the silica support. When CO is pumped off, the acidic Cr*\"1\" sites become available again for the chemisorption and the cycle may be repeated. Such a displacement mechan- ism is identical with that observed on Mo/SiOg catalysts and described in detail in [13]. Nature and structure of adsorbing sites The stretching frequency of the CO group o-bonded to surface cations in a [ OC M(CO)g] chemisorbed species is very sensitive to the acidic 78 characteristics of the adsorbing sites. Consequently, any heterogeneity among the chromium ions exposed on a chromia-silica catalyst is expected to be revealed by the appearance of a number of bands in the low-frequency range. The presence of three components at =\"1860 cm\"1 (weak shoulder), 1841 cm\"1 (peak) and 1813 cm\"1 (heavy shoulder) in the broad and complex absorption at low frequencies in Fig. 1 definitely indicates that three slightly different chemisorbed species exist on the surface of a standard chromia silica catalyst prereduced in CO. To discuss the nature of the related adsorbing sites, these results must be compared with information from the adsorption of carbon monoxide on the same catalyst. CO adsorbed on Cr2^ sites (blue S sample) Thanks to the increasing interest in chromia silica systems, theories on the nature of chromium ions exposed on such samples are subjected to continuous improvement [14-15,22-26]. The average oxidation number of chromium exposed on the surface of an S sample is 2.1, showing that by far the vast majority of the cations are present as Cr(II) [14]. This justifies the blue colour of the sample prereduced in CO. The deviation from the ideal value of 2.0 is due to a very small fraction of Cr(III). On the basis of IR spectra of adsorbed CO as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, it has been recently proposed [14] that three types of Cr(II) ions (labelled A, B and C, coordinated to two, three and four oxygen ligands respectively) are exposed on an S sample. Only Cr(II)A and CrdDa appear to be able to adsorb CO at room temperature to give tricarbonyl (peak at 2184 and shoulder at 2178cm\"1) and monocarbonyl (shoulder at 2191cm\"1) species respectively. In this model, no band of adsorbed CO can be associated with Cr(II)c and Cr(III). CO adsorbed on Cr34\" sites (green H sample) Being comparatively inactive in ethylene polymerization, the sample prereduced in hydrogen has never been studied in detail. However it was shown that, in agreement with the observed green colour, the average oxidation number of chromium on such a sample was close to 3 [24,27] and, consequently, the band at 2191 cm~1 in the spectrum of carbon monoxide adsorbed on the H sample (Fig. 3, inset) can be assigned to CO on Cr3'1' ions. This peak is found at the same position as the high frequency component in the spectrum of CO adsorbed on the blue sample (Fig. 1, inset). A thorough comparison of the spectra of CO adsorbed on different samples is outside the scope of this report and will be dealt with in a future paper [28]. We merely note here that the stretching frequency of a CO molecule bonded to a transition metal ion is a complicated function of: (a) the polarizing power of the sites and, consequently, the strength of the o-bond involving the lone pair on the carbon atom (Lewis acidity); and (b) the availability of d-electrons, determining the extent of back- donation onto the antibonding JI orbital of the CO molecule. 79 Both factors depend not only on the oxidation state but also on the coordination of the ions, and it is therefore conceivable that CO molecules adsorbed on Cr(II) and Cr(III) show bands in the same region. Notably, CO adsorbed by Cr3\"1' ions on a-Cr^Oy samples was reported to absorb at 2170-2185 cm-1 [29,30]. -OC Mo(CO)s adsorbed ore Cr(II) and Cr(III) sites The role of w-back donation in the stabilization of 0-bonded CO is negligible as compared with C-bonded carbonyls [20] and, consequently, the formation of a Me\"\"1'- OC Mo(CO)5 adduct depends primarily on the acidic characteristics of the adsorbing centres, as determined by the acceptor strength an the steric bulk of the Lewis acid sites. The results of Fig. 3 lead to the following conclusions: (a) the two main components at low frequencies (peak at 1841 cm\"1 and strong shoulder at 1813 cm~1) in spectrum a (blue sample) are certainly associated with two families of Cr(II) sites differing in coordination; such sites might well be the Cr(II)A and Cr(II)B ions having two and three oxygen ligands [14]; (b) the peak at 1855cm-1 in spectrum b (green sample) is very likely associated with adducts formed on Cr(III) sites, which are abundant on the catalyst reduced in hydrogen. Of the two types of Cr(II) sites, those showing the lowest coordination are expected to induce the largest low-frequency shift in the stretching frequency of the 0-bonded CO. The component at 1813 cm~1 might, therefore, be associated with Cr(II)A OC Mo(CO)5 complexes and that at 1841 cm-1 with Cr(II)B OC Mo(CO)5 complexes. As for the Cr(III) OC Mo(CO)5 complexes, it is surprising that, although the larger positive charge of Cr(III) ions should produce a larger polarizing strength, the shift of the CO stretching frequency is lower than observed in the case of Cr(II). However, it should be considered that the larger effect due to the larger charge might well be compensated by the opposite effects of a higher coordination. It is worth noting here that Cr(III) cations require at least three oxygen ligands, and that the experimental conditions during the preparation of a green sample surely favour the formation of highly shielded surface sites, due to the continuous production of water upon reduction in hydrogen [22-24]. Finally, the question might be raised whether the very weak shoulder at 1850 1860 cm~1 observed in the case of a blue sample (Fig. 3a) is due to a third type of divalent site, such as CrdDc, or to the small amount of Cr(III) sites produced even when reducing in carbon monoxide. In both cases, Mo(CO)e should exhibit surface sites which are not revealed by CO adsorption at ambient temperature [14]. This topic will be discussed in a future report [28]. OC Mo (C0)s adsorbed on Mo (V) sites It has been shown above that the frequency of the 0-bonded CO in 80 carbonyl is extremely sensitive to changes in the charge and/or the coordination of chromium ions (Figs. 1-3). The same would be expected for a Mo/SiOg catalyst, which, after reduction in hydrogen, exposes metal particles and molybdenum cations in oxidation states ranging from 3+ to 5+ [13]. The spectrum of Mo(CO)e adsorbed on a molybdenum catalyst is much simpler in the low frequency range than the parallel spectrum on chromia- silica. In fact only one band is observed in Fig. 4b at 1775 cm~1 assignable to the stretching mode of 0-bonded CO in Mo^ OC Mo(CO)s, showing that only one type of molybdenum cation can stabilize OC Mo(CO)s adducts. On the basis of the analysis of CO adsorption, it was suggested that such sites were Mo5^ cations [13]. A comparison of the spectra in Fig. 4 supports the above hypothesis. Considering that the radius of Mo6\"1' (0.63 A) is smaller than the radius of Cr(II) (0.73-82 A) and similar to that of Cr(III) (0.62 A) [31], Mo6\"^ is expected to be a stronger acid due to the larger charge and to induce a consistently greater low-frequency shift of the 0-bonded CO, as indeed observed in Fig. 4. Conclusions Metal carbonyls are shown to be useful probes for the characterization of acidic metal cations on silica-supported catalysts. Molybdenum hexacar- bonyl procedures: (a) physisorbed Mo(CO)e species on the silica support, whose spectral features are similar to those of the free molecule; (b) chemisorbed OC Mo(CO)s species, where the stretching fre- quency of the 0-bonded CO entity is extremely sensitive to oxidation state and coordination of the metal centres. The presence of at least two types of Cr(II) ions and of Cr(III) ions is revealed on chromia silica catalysts prepared in different ways. It is confirmed that the sites adsorbing Mo(CO)e on a molybdenum silica catalyst are highly charged metal cations (Mo64\"). References 1 K. F. Howe, Inorg. Chem., 15 (1976) 486. 2 J. R. Andersen, P.

Curie, 4 Place Jussieu 75252, Paris Cédex 05 France Molybdenum hexacarbonyl was admitted onto chromia-silica catalysts prepared both by reduction in CO, which produces Cr(II)-rich samples, and by reduction in hydrogen, which produces Cr(III)-rich samples. Cr(II)⋯OC—Mo(CO)5 and Cr(III)⋯OC—Mo(CO)5 adducts are formed whose infrared spectral features, particularly the stretching mode of the O-bonded CO entity, depend on the charge of the cation and on its coordination. Mo(CO)6 species physisorbed on the support are also observed. These results are compared with previous results relative to molybdenum/silica catalysts. References 1 R.F. Howe Inorg.
