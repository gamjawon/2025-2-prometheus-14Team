Mono-dispersive hierarchical NiO and Ni/C microspheres were synthesized through a precursor method. The uniform coordination precursor microspheres were easily obtained by treating nickel acetate in methanol under solvothermal conditions. After the precursor was calcined in the air or nitrogen, two kinds of Ni-based nanostructures, NiO and Ni/C can be obtained, respectively. Both the Ni-based nanostructures are uniform mono-dispersive microspheres as the parent precursor and have hierarchical structures assembled by NiO and Ni nanoparticles.

Keywords Hierarchical NiO microspheres Ni/C nanostructures Ammonium perchlorate combustion 1 Introduction In the past decades, assembling nano building blocks into hierarchical structures on a large scale has attracted more and more interests of chemists and materials scientists due to their potential applications in many fields, such as catalysis, photonic crystals, optoelectronic devices, and so on. Until now, several hierarchical structures including hierarchically structured Ni(OH)2 hollow-spheres and two-/three-dimensional metal–polymer amphiphile structures have been obtained based on different mechanisms [1–3]. However, it is still a big challenge for materials scientists to control the morphology and the assembly mode of original building units and the assembly of nanostructures should be continuously researched for novel properties and potential applications. Nanosized metal nickel (Ni), a magnetic material, has received extensive attentions due to its intriguing properties and promising applications in magnetic sensors, memory devices, catalysts and galvano-magnetic materials. As a conductive metal, it has been widely used in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCS) and telecommunication devices. The synthesis of nickel nanoparticles with controlled size and morphology has been of scientific and technological interests [4–6]. Until now, several different synthetic methods, such as vapor phase method, spray pyrolysis, micro-emulsion, polyol process and electrochemical reduction have been developed for the synthesis of Ni nanostructures [7–10]. For example, Duan et. al. reported the fabrication of hierarchical Ni nanoring and hollow sphere arrays based on ordered through-pore template and electrodeposition [11]. Chain-like Ni architectures assembled by urchin-like hierarchical nanostructures were obtained by a simple hydrothermal reduction process without the use of any templates or surfactants [12]. Nickel oxide (NiO), a transparent p-type semiconductor oxide, is also a prosperous material because of the particular catalytic, anomalous electronic and magnetic properties and a variety of applications in many fields such as catalysis, sensors, battery cathodes, electro-chromic films, and fuel cell electrodes [13–18]. Up to now, nickel oxide with different nano/micro-structures has been reported [19,20]. Hierarchical NiO polyhedrons were synthesized from hierarchical concave Ni(OH)2 polyhedron achieved with the assistance of hydrazine molecules [21]. Hollow NiO microspheres were obtained by thermal decomposition of Ni(OH)2 microspheres fabricated in a strong alkaline solution of glycine [22]. Zhang group reported a template-free synthetic approach for generating NiO nano/micro spherical superstructures with hierarchical meso- and macro-porosity involving thermal decomposition of β-Ni(OH)2, obtained via refluxing an alkaline solution with Ni(NH3) x 2+ at 97°C [23]. Although many efforts have been made and some successes have been achieved, the synthesis of nickel and nickel oxide nanomaterials with controllable shape and size, especially with hierarchical structures, continues to be a major target for the materials scientists. In the study presented here, we reported a facile route to synthesize mono-dispersive hierarchical NiO and Ni/C microspheres with good catalytic abilities by calcining a nickel coordination precursor in different atmospheres. The coordination precursor was prepared through a very simple and convenient route by dispersing nickel acetate in solvent methanol, followed by treatment under solvothermal conditions for a short time. The whole process (as shown in Scheme 1 ) only uses two chemicals and very easy to control without using any templates or surfactants. After the precursor was calcined in different atmospheres, two kinds of Ni-based nanostructures, NiO and Ni/C microspheres with uniform size can be obtained, respectively. These hierarchical nickel-based microspheres are composed of NiO or Ni nanoparticles and demonstrated to be good catalysts for the propellant combustion of ammonium perchlorate (AP). 2 Experimental For the synthesis of the precursor, 0.1g of nickel acetate (NiAc2·2H2O) was dispersed in 20mL of methanol under stirring, and then the solution was transferred into a 50mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and kept under static conditions in an oven at 200°C for 4h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the precursor was collected, washed with distilled water and ethanol for three times and dried at 30°C in the air. Then the precursor was calcined in the air or N2 to form NiO or Ni/C nanostructures, respectively. For the synthesis of NiO nanostructures, the precursor was calcined at 450°C for 2h in the air. For the synthesis of Ni/C nanostructures, the precursor was calcined at 300°C for 10min in N2 atmosphere. 2.1 Characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a SHIMADZU XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer at Cu Kα radiation with 40kV beam voltage and 30mA beam current. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electronic microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured on a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200kV. The catalytic roles of Ni-based microspheres in the thermal decomposition of AP were studied by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) using STA 449°C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 20°Cmin−1 in N2 atmosphere over the temperature range of 20–500°C. The mass percentage of Ni-based nanostructures to AP in the mixture is mixed at 2%. 3 Results and discussions Fig. 1a shows XRD pattern of the obtained precursor. The pattern displays some diffraction peaks, but these peaks can't be indexed to simple Ni compounds such as NiAc2, NiO or Ni. The intense diffraction peak at around 10° indicates that the precursor might be a coordination of Ni and organic component in the reaction system. Fig. 1b displays IR pattern of the precursor, showing the adsorption peaks of ―OH, ―C―O and ―CH3. This result confirms the existence of organic component in the precursor. Inductively coupled plasma analysis (ICP) and element analysis were carried out to speculate about the Ni:organic component stoichiometry. From ICP analysis, the weight percentage of Ni in the precursor was determined to be 52.6%. From element analysis, the percentages of C and H in the precursor are 18.1 and 3.34%, respectively, and the percentage of O can be calculated to be 25.96%. Based on these data, the precursor is speculated to be Ni(CH3O)2. Fig. 2a and b displays SEM images of as-prepared precursor. It can be clearly seen that the precursor are dispersive spheres, which are very uniform and have an average diameter of about 2μm. As the SEM image (Fig. 2b) with a higher magnification shown, these spheres are composed of many curly sheets, which are several nanometers in thickness, to form a hierarchically micro-spherical structures. TEM images (Fig. 2c and d) also confirm that the precursor is dispersive microspheres with a diameter of 2μm. The edge of the microsphere clearly shows that the microspheres are composed of nanosheets with a thickness of several nanometers. These precursor microspheres are obtained by solvothermal treatment of NiAc2 and methanol. As NiAc2 is inorganic compound and methanol is organic solution, it is reasonable that the formed precursor would intend to accumulate to form sphere morphology in order to decrease the surface energy. After the precursor was calcined in the air at 450°C for 2h, NiO nanostructures can be synthesized. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the obtained product. All diffraction peaks can be indexed to cubic NiO (JCPDS card No. 78-0429) and no peaks rising from impurities can be detected, indicating that NiO crystals with high purity have been obtained. By using the Scherrer diffraction formula (d = kλ / βcosθ), the size of the NiO nanocrystals is calculated to be 20nm. Fig. 4a and b show SEM images of the NiO nanostructures. It can be seen that the sample still consists of microspheres with uniform size as the parent precursor. The NiO microspheres have an average diameter of about 2μm, maintaining the morphology and the size of the precursor microspheres. An SEM image with a relative high magnification (Fig. 4c) shows that the obtained NiO microspheres are also composed of nanosheets. But unlike the precursor microspheres, the nanosheets do not have smooth surfaces and are composed of many nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are less than 50nm in diameter and connect to each other to form the nanosheets, which are assembled to form the hierarchical structure of NiO microspheres. The dispersive NiO microspheres are very loose. There are many pores among the small NiO nanoparticles and N2 adsorption measurement shows they have a BET specific surface area of 12.91m2/g and a pore volume of 88.96mm3/g, which would make them great candidates for potential applications in catalysis. When the precursor was calcined in nitrogen at 300°C for 10min, another nickel-based nanostructure, Ni/C composite can be obtained. Fig. 3b shows the XRD pattern of the sample and all the strong diffraction peaks can be indexed to cubic nickel (JCPDS card No. 04-0850). The crystal size can be calculated to be 30nm by the Scherrer diffraction formula. The broad peak at about 20–30 ° indicates the existence of amorphous compound. As the precursor was prepared by solvothermal-treating of NiAc2 in methanol, there are only Ni, C, H, and O in the system and after the calcination of precursor in N2, the only amorphous compound can be left is C, which would be from the carbonization of organic molecules (methanol). At 300°C in N2, the presence of carbon would reduce Ni2+ to form Ni crystals. TG-DTA analyses of the precursor in N2 and the air have been done to determine the content of C in the Ni/C microspheres. As shown in Fig. 1c, the mass percentages of Ni/C and NiO after calcination are 59.1% and 66.2%, respectively. The C% in the Ni/C can be calculated as follows: Ni @ C + O2 → NiO + CO Ni → NiO 59.1 % 66.2 % 58.7 74.7 X 66.2 X = 66.2 × 58.7 / 74.7 = 52.0 % Y = 59.1 - 52.0 = 7.1 % C % in Ni @ C = 7.1 / 59.1 = 12.0 % So the carbon content in the Ni/C composite is calculated to be 12.0%. Fig. 4d–f shows SEM images of the obtained Ni nanostructures with different magnifications, displaying that the Ni nanostructures also remain the morphology and the size of the precursor and are microspheres composed of Ni nanoparticles. Compared to the NiO structures, in which NiO nanocrystals form nanosheets first and then assemble to form the hierarchical microspheres, these Ni nanoparticles connect to each other to form the microspheres directly. The Ni/C microspheres also have many pores and the specific surface area of and the pore volume are measured to be 9.65m2/g and 18.74mm3/g, respectively. As an important oxidizer and energetic material in solid rocket propellant, ammonium perchlorate (AP) is believed to play a key role in the performance of solid rocket propellants. Usually, pure AP has two decomposition temperatures at 350 and 460°C and most of the AP decomposes at the high temperature. Because decomposition of AP at high temperature is complex and dangerous, different methods have been investigated to make AP decompose at lower temperatures and many metal and metal oxide nanomaterials have been used as catalysts to decrease the decomposition temperature of AP [24]. There are four points, including efficient heat transfer, high surface area, the coordination ability, and the reactivity of metal with the decomposition products of AP, which are believed to be key reasons for the better catalytic performance of nanosized powders [25]. NiO and Ni/C microstructures are compounds of transitional metal Ni, which has good coordination ability to AP, and have high surface areas and pore volumes, which make us believe that they would have good catalytic abilities for the thermal decomposition of AP. Herein, we mixed the obtained samples with AP and studied the catalytic properties by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC curves of pure AP and the mixtures of AP with the samples are showed in Fig. 5 and the AP decomposition parameters are shown in Table 1 . Every curve in Fig. 5 has an endothermic peak at 245°C, which is caused by the crystal transformation of AP from orthorhombic to cubic phase [26]. There are two exothermic peaks at 367 and 460°Cfor pure AP, corresponding to the low-temperature decomposition (LTD) and the high-temperature decomposition (HTD), respectively. In the low-temperature decomposition step, the exothermic peak at 367°C is attributed to the partial decomposition of AP and formation of some intermediate NH3 and HClO4 by dissociation and sublimation, while in HTD step, the exothermic peak at about 460°C is caused by the complete decomposition to volatile products [26]. The high-temperature decomposition (HTD) peak is higher than the low-temperature one (LTD), which means the high-temperature decomposition is dominant as 88.4% weight loss happens at this stage. When the sample powders were used as catalysts for the decomposition of AP, the curves also have two exothermic peaks. However, these two exothermic peaks both shift to lower temperatures and more weight losses happen at low-temperature decomposition stage. In particular, for NiO microspheres, there only is a potty HTD peak and 72.0% weight loss take place at 329°Cindicating the good catalysis ability of hierarchical NiO microspheres for the AP decomposition. NiO microspheres have better catalytic performances than Ni/C microspheres, which might be due to its higher surface area and larger pore volume. After the catalytic experiments, XRD and SEM characterizations of the samples were carried out. Fig. 6 shows XRD patterns and SEM images of the samples after the catalytic tests. Both the XRD patterns can be indexed to be NiO, which means that NiO microspheres are still NiO, but the Ni/C microspheres has been changed to NiO. This is because that AP is an oxidizer and energetic material, which can lead to the oxidation of Ni to NiO. From the SEM images, the NiO samples still have spherical morphologies and composed of many NiO nanoparticles. However compared to the SEM images before the catalytic tests, the NiO nanoparticles after the catalytic tests have a larger size. During the tests, the decomposition of AP gives out huge heat which would lead to the growth of NiO nanoparticles. 4 Conclusions In summary, two kinds of mono-dispersive hierarchical nickel-based nanostructures were synthesized by a simple precursor method. The precursor microspheres can be easily obtained by simply treating NiAc2 in methanol under solvothermal conditions. The whole process only needs 2 chemicals, without any templates and surfactants. The Ni-based nanostructures show significant catalytic abilities for AP decomposition.
