Liu, G.D. Lei, W.M.H. Sachtler * V.N. lpatieff Laboratory, Center fi~r Catalysis and Surface Science, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA Received 25 September 1995; revised 20 November 1995; accepted 20 November 1995 Abstract Isomerization of small alkanes is compared over two bifunctional catalysts with similar concentrations of metal and acid sites and similar strengths of Brcnsted acid sites. The catalytic performance and the kinetic parameters are significantly different for Pt/H-Mor and Pt/ZrO2-SOa catalysts. Under conditions where n-butane isomerization is rapid over Pt/ZrOz-SO4, it is undetectable over Pt/H-Mor. The apparent activation energy of n-pentane isomerization is significantly higher over the zeolite based catalyst. These differences can be rationalized in terms of different pore geometries: in the one-dimensional pore system of mordenite the rates of monomolecular reactions are single file diffusion controlled; as a result, bimolecular processes such as isomerization via intermediate dimer formation are all but impossible. Likewise, hydride ion transfer, which is the chain propagation step in alkane reactions via carbenium ions, is sterically inhibited in micropores and replaced by a process involving Pt-proton adducts.

Introduction Since the invention of 'catalytic reforming' and 'platforming', isomerization of n-alkanes to branched alkanes has become a large-scale industrial process. Lower reaction temperatures yield a greater proportion of branched alkanes at thermodynamic equilibrium. Chlorided platinum/alumina catalysts, which can be considered to be superacids, are used at low temperatures (400-460 K). However, these catalysts are very sensitive to poisons such as water or aromat- \" Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 1-708) 4915263, fax.

Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 167-177 ics. The environmental problems with the regeneration of theses catalysts have also revived interest in halogen-free isomerization catalysts. Bifunctional cata- lysts, in particular Pt/H-Mordenite, are halogen-free alternatives currently employed though they are less active, requiring a temperature above 520 K. The mechanism for skeletal isomerization of small alkanes has been studied extensively in liquid superacids and is found to proceed via a protonated cyclopropane intermediate [1,2]. For C5+ hydrocarbons, this path avoids the energetically prohibitive stage of a primary carbenium ion. In the case of butane, however, opening of the protonated methylcyclopropane ring to a carbocation with iso-C4 structure inevitably leads to a primary carbenium ion. Therefore, skeletal isomerization of butane was reported to be negligible under conditions where C5+ hydrocarbons swiftly isomerized in strong liquid acids. Likewise, over the solid catalyst Pt/A1203-SiO2 the isomerization rate of n-butane at 573 K was found to be much slower than that of n-pentane [3]. Hsu et al. reported that ZrO2-SO4-based catalysts, and in particular Fe, Mn-ZrO2-SO4, were superactive for n-butane isomerization [4]. Adeeva et al. showed that the acid sites of these catalysts are not stronger than the Br~nsted sites in acid zeolites or the Lewis sites in y-alumina [5]. By using isotopically labelled n-butane and kinetic analysis it was further shown that over unpromoted ZrO2-SO4, Fe, Mn promoted ZrO2-SO4, and Pt/ZrO2-SO4 (Pt-SZ) catalysts the isomerization of n-butane to i-butane is a bimolecular process, involving intermediate formation of butene and an adsorbed C8 entity [6,7]. In contrast, the isomerization of n-pentane over the same catalyst appears to mainly use a monomolecular pathway with only a small contribution of a parallel bimolecular mechanism [8]. These findings reveal a strong similarity of the basic chemistry that determines acid catalyzed alkane reactions in liquid acids and over solid acid catalysts. An unsolved problem is, however, the striking difference in catalytic performance between the bifunctional solid catalyst Pt-SZ and zeolite based catalysts, such as Pt/H-mordenite (PtHMor) with roughly the same numbers of acid and exposed Pt sites and similar acid strength of the Brc~nsted acid sites. In the present study, the catalytic isomerization of n-pentane and n-butane over Pt/H-Mordenite (PtHMor) is studied under the same conditions and in the same reactor that was used for similar work with Pt-SZ, with the objective to identify and rationalize the differences in the kinetics and the reaction mecha- nism over these solid acid catalysts. 2. Experimental The preparation of the Pt-SZ catalysts was as previously reported [7]. PtHMor samples were prepared by ion exchange of ammonium mordenite (LZ-M-8, UOP, lot# 13744-24, Si/A1 = 8) with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4CIe. ICP H. Liu et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 167-177 169 analysis showed that the Pt-SZ catalyst contained 0.38 wt.-% Pt and 1.8 wt.-% S. The PtHMor catalyst contained 0.45 wt.-% Pt. The catalytic data were collected in a microflow reactor at 11 bar total pressure as described in Ref. [7]. The partial pressures of H2 and the alkanes were adjusted by controlling the flow rates of the feed components. In one series of experiments over Pt-SZ, the partial pressure of one feed component was varied at a constant overall flow rate while the partial pressures of the other reactants were kept constant by adapting the helium make-up. The reaction orders in hydrogen and n-pentane or n-butane were then determined from the resultant changes in the conversion and produc- tion rates. The effluent was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography with a 50 m 0.2 mm capillary column of PONA (Hewlett-Packard) attached to a FID detector. The production rates of hydrocarbons were normalized to mole num- bers of n-pentane or n-butane per gram catalyst per second (mol (gcat)-! S-1). The reactant and products of methane, ethane, propane, butane, i-pentane, n-pentane, and hexane were assigned as Cl, C2, C3, C4, i-Cs, n-C5, and C6, respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic tests of n-pentane and n-butane isomerization over Pt/H- mordenite Fig. 1 shows the reaction rates for the products of n-pentane isomerization over PtHMor at 479 K. At a hydrogen pressure of 2.2 bar, activity and selectivity remain constant with time on stream for the duration of the 15 h test. The i-pentane selectivity is 97%. No hexanes were observed. For n-butane reaction over the PtHMor catalyst, no activity was observed below 500 K; conversion and selectivities at 544 K are shown in Fig. 2. The selectivity to i-butane is low, viz. 9.5%; the predominant products are C2 and C3. Only a very small amount of pentane was observed. This behavior is strongly in contrast to that of Pt-SZ where n-butane conversion at 479 K is 3.45%, with a selectivity to i-butane of 94.8%. For n-pentane isomerization over PtHMor and Pt-SZ the relevant parameters are compiled in Table 1. The isomerization rate of n-pentane is considerable both over Pt-SZ and PtHMor, with the latter catalyst being more active. The cracking rate is roughly five times higher over Pt-SZ than over PtHMor. No C6 product was observed over the PtHMor catalyst. 3.2. Temperature effects An Arrhenius plot for n-pentane isomerization over PtHMor over a wide range of reaction temperatures is found to significantly deviate from linearity. Over Pt-SZ, however, perfectly linear Arrhenius plots are obtained, both for n-pentane and for n-butane; the corresponding activation energies are much 170 H.

The orders in hydrogen are generally more negative at higher H2/n-C5 ratios. The rates of n-pentane conversion and product formation increase with an increase in the n-pentane pressure. All lines in the In rate vs. In p(n-C5) graph are linear and have positive slopes, except for the formation of butane, which is independent of the n-pentane pressure within experimental error. The rate of n-pentane conversion has an order in n-pentane of + 0.53; the formation rates of i-pentane, butane, and (C~ + C2 + C3), have orders in n-pentane of +0.54, 0, and + 0.23, respectively. The orders in n-pentane change little with the H Jn-C5 ratio; only the order in butane formation becomes -0.61 at high H2/n-C5. 4. Discussion 4.1. Single-file diffusion over Pt / H-mordenite The most striking result of this work is the huge difference of these catalysts in the isomerization of butane. The Pt-SZ catalyst is very active, PtHMor is virtually inactive under the same conditions. In contrast, the isomerization rates of n-pentane over these catalysts are quite comparable; the conversions differ by 174 H. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 167-177 less than a factor of two. As the isomerization of n-butane includes a bimolecu- lar step, whereas n-pentane isomerizes via a monomolecular mechanism, it appears that a decisive difference between the two catalysts is their different propensity to catalyze b/molecular reactions. Both catalysts contain comparable numbers of acid and metal sites; also the strength of the acid sites is comparable [5]. The results, therefore, suggest that the different pore geometry is a key factor. Mordenite has a system of one-dimensional micropores, whereas SZ has a wide distribution of pore sizes. Under conditions of pressure and temperature where physisorption is significant, single file diffusion is expected for PtHMor, but not for Pt-SZ. For a mathematical analysis of the effects of single file diffusion on the rate of catalytic reactions we refer to papers by K~irger et al. [9,10]. Their recently published model calculations also include the effect of this diffusion type on the apparent activation energy [10]. The effect of single-file diffusion on the kinetic parameters of catalytic processes is strikingly different from that of ordinary diffusion control, as described by the Thiele modulus and by Wheeler's formula. At low temperatures, when physisorption in such pores is high, only the few sites near the pore mouths contribute effectively to the observed reaction rate. At higher temperatures, when physisorption is less important, the much more numerous sites in the interior of the pores fully contribute to the reaction rate registered outside the pores. Consequently, there is a temperature regime in which the observed reaction rate increases more steeply with temperature than it would if the number of contributing sites were constant. In other words, the apparent activation energy is higher than the intrinsic activation energy of the chemical process. In previous work we found this to be true of neopentane conversion on Pd/KL catalysts [11]. In this case, the one-dimensional micro- pores of the L zeolite led to single-file diffusion, with an apparent activation energy substantially higher than the intrinsic activation energy [ 11 ]. In contrast, the same reaction over Pd/NaY with a three-dimensional pore system displayed a lower than intrinsic activation energy, in agreement with the classical pore diffusion model. Related work on Pt/mordenite has shown that the transforma- tion, by local destruction of the zeolite framework, of a one-dimensional pore system into a three-dimensional pore system results in a marked increase of the observed reaction rate [12,13]. Physisorption of alkanes on zeolites, including H-mordenite has been mea- sured by Eberly [ 14]. This author reports for n-hexane in H-mordenite a value of - 65.7 kJ/mol for the enthalpy of adsorption. Carvill calculated from Eberly's data that at 240 and 40 Torr partial pressure of n-hexane, 385 molecules are adsorbed per/xm of channel length [ 15]. In the present work n-pentane has been used, with a slightly lower heat of adsorption, at a higher pressure (55 Torr) and a lower temperature (typically 205) than in the example used by Carvill. We estimate that crowding of physisorbed molecules in the channels will be slightly higher, i.e. the average distance between physisorbed molecules in H-mordenite H. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 167-177 175 will be roughly 2.5 nm. This matches the conditions for which single file diffusion applies. The opening of the main channel in mordenite is 6.5 7.0 ,~2 wide, whereas the minimum kinetic diameters for n-butane and i-butane are 4.3 and 5.0 respectively [16]. In such one-dimensional pores two-way traffic is difficult or impossible; transport of molecules through the channels resembles the 'string of pearls' situation described by KS_rger et al. [9]. For this geometry a higher than intrinsic activation energy is predicted at low temperatures; at higher tempera- tures, when the physisorption is small, the activation energy will approach the intrinsic value. It therefore seems plausible to attribute the exceptionally high apparent activation energy over PtHMor in the low temperature regime to the limitation by single file diffusion in the one-dimensional mordenite channels. The higher rate of n-pentane isomerization over Pt-SZ is thus caused, at least partially, by the more favorable geometry of this catalysts system. 4.2. Effect of pore geometry on isomerization mechanism of n-butane For n-butane isomerization over Pt-SZ a bimolecular pathway is used, involving an adsorbed C8 intermediate. The huge difference in catalytic activity between Pt-SZ and PtHMor indicates that PtHMor is unable to catalyze this bimolecular reaction. In previous research, Iglesia and Baumgartner argued that the high performance and stability of Pt/KL catalysts for C6 aromatization is due to the very low chance for bimolecular reactions in one-dimensional micropores [17]. This is a consequence of the general principle that bimolecular encounters are extremely unlikely in one-dimensional pores [18]. Since butanes and pentanes have the same minimum kinetic diameters, the geometric con- straints which force pentane isomerization to be single file diffusion controlled will also prevent butane molecules from passing each other in one-dimensional mordenite channels. As the inter-molecular route requires that a butene molecule interacts with an adjacent C4 carbenium ion, this process would suffer greatly from the geometrical constraints in PtHMor. It is interesting to note that in the case of n-pentane isomerization over Pt-SZ the main reaction is monomolecular, but that the minor contribution of a bimolecular mechanism is indicated by the formation of hexane as a byproduct. This suggests that with Pt-SZ a pathway exists in which C5 is dimerized to C10 intermediates. In contrast, this reaction pathway appears to be impossible with PtHMor under the same conditions: no hexane formation was observed. This lends further credence to the view that under the conditions studied the peculiar geometry of the one-dimensional pores in mordenite suppresses the bimolecular pathway. 4.3. Isomerization on Pt-proton adducts Although the rates per gram catalyst of n-pentane isomerization differ less than a factor of two between PtHMor and Pt-SZ, their kinetic parameters in 176 H. Liu et al.//Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 167-177 Table 2 reveal a rather dramatic difference between these catalysts. Acid catalyzed reactions of alkanes are known to be chain reactions in which hydride ion transfer is an important step. In the case of Pt-SZ it is likely that hydride ion transfer occurs when an alkane molecule impinges to an adsorbed carbenium ion. This bi-molecular process of the Eley-Rideal type enables every alkane molecule to be temporarily in the state of an adsorbed carbenium ion. Such a process will, however, be very difficult inside the micropores of mordenite. It thus appears plausible that on PtHMor adsorbed carbenium ions are formed in a different way, viz. via dissociative adsorption of n-pentane on Pt metal clusters, or as suggested in other work of the present group, dissociative adsorption on Pt-proton adducts. In view of those results, which we shall not repeat here, it is most likely that isomerization will take place on Pt-proton adducts which thus act as 'collapsed bifunctional sites' [19,20]: n- CsHI2 + H Pto ~ n- CsH~]- Ptn + H2 (1) n - CsH~]- Pt, ---> i- CsH~]- Ptn (2) i- CsH~-1- Pt, + H2 ~ i- C5H12 + H+- Pt, (3) The concentration of these CsH~]-ions will be proportional to the ratio (Pc n,2/PH ); accordingly, the reaction orders over PtHMor are negative (0 > n >~ - 1) i~a H2 and positive (0 < n < 1) in pentane, but over Pt-SZ they are near zero in H 2 and > 1 in pentane. The predictions of this model agree with the observed kinetic parameters. 5. Conclusions The remarkable differences in isomerization rate of n-butane between PtH- Mor and Pt-SZ and the significant differences in kinetic parameters for the isomerization of n-pentane indicate that the reaction mechanisms are fundamen- tally different over these catalysts. Whereas the numbers of metal and acid sites are comparable and the strength of the acid sites is similar in these bifunctional catalysts, the microgeometry is significantly different. It has been shown that the observed differences in catalysis and kinetic parameters can be rationalized in terms of geometric factors. The high apparent activation energy and the pre- dicted break in the Arrhenius plot at a temperature where physisorption of n-pentane becomes small, indicate that over PtHMor t single-file diffusion controls n-pentane isomerization. Additional kinetic data suggest that the pre- vailing pentane isomerization mechanism is intra-molecular and that a Pt-pro- ton adduct is the catalytic site for this bifunctional reaction. For butane isomerization, the geometrical constraints of one-dimensional channels in mor- denite suppress the dimerization step. Therefore, PtHMor is virtually inactive for n-butane isomerization, whereas Pt-SZ with acid sites of comparable strength is a highly active and stable catalyst. H.

The catalytic performance and the kinetic parameters are significantly different for Pt/H-Mor and Pt/ZrO2 SO4 catalysts.

The apparent activation energy of n-pentane isomerization is significantly higher over the zeolite based catalyst. These differences can be rationalized in terms of different pore geometries: in the one-dimensional pore system of mordenite the rates of monomolecular reactions aresingle file diffusion controlled; as a result, bimolecular processes such as isomerization via intermediate dimer formation are all but impossible. Likewise, hydride ion transfer, which is the chain propagation step in alkane reactions via carbenium ions, is sterically inhibited in micropores and replaced by a process involving Pt-proton adducts.
