DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60296-3 ARTICLE Hydrothermal Synthesis of Porous Ag 2 S Sensitized TiO 2 Catalysts and Their Photocatalytic Activities in the Visible Light Range ZHU Lei, MENG Zeda, TRISHA Ghosh, OH Won-Chun* Department of Advanced Materials Science & Engineering, Hanseo University, Chungnam 356-706, Korea Abstract: Porous Ag 2 S sensitized TiO 2 catalysts were synthesized by the hydrothermal process. The crystallization and porous structure of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocatalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and N 2 adsorption. The Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites were mainly composed of anatase TiO 2 and acanthite Ag 2 S. The absorption edge wavelengths of TiO 2 and the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite prepared with 3 mmol Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O were 400 and 800 nm, respectively, that is, the absorption edge of the composite had a pronounced red shift. The photocatalytic activity under visible light was investigated by the degradation of methylene blue with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic activities under visible light of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 photocatalysts were much higher than that of TiO 2 . Key words: silver sulfide; titanium dioxide; visible light; photocatalytic activity; methylene blue The treatment of industrial wastewaters to remove organic pollutants is a very important aspect of environmental tech- nology. Heterogeneous photocatalysis as an advanced oxida- tion technique has been developed for it [1,2]. Nanocrystalline semiconductors are used as photocatalysts to initiate interfacial redox reactions because of their unique physicochemical properties resulting from their nanosized dimensions and large surface/volume ratios. The most common semiconductors for waste degradation are TiO 2 , ZnO, and CdS [3]. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) has the advantages of high activity, good stability, and low cost, and it is fairly harmless to humans. However, the main drawback of TiO 2 is its relatively large band gap (anatase: 3.2 eV, rutile: 3.0 eV). As a consequence, TiO 2 shows photocatalytic activity only in the near-ultraviolet region and can harvest only a small fraction (< 5%) of incident solar radiation [4]. Therefore, modifying TiO 2 photocatalysts to enhance light absorption and photocatalytic activity under visible light has been a main research direction in recent years. The development of a visible light-responsive photocatalyst based on TiO 2 coupled with a visible light sensitizer is an im- portant goal. Metals [5], non-metallic elements [6], and ad- sorbed dyes [7] have been used as sensitizers. However, these have shortcomings. For instance, transition metals easily be- come the recombination centers of photoelectron-hole pairs, and the photosensitizers easily fall off. In contrast, compound formation with a semiconductor [8] is considered an effective method. With nanoscale coupled semiconductors, it can be expected that the TiO 2 photocatalytic activity will be signifi- cantly improved by the enhancement of charge separation and minimization or inhibition of charge-carrier recombination [9,10]. Ag 2 S is useful for this because it is a direct, narrow band gap semiconductor [11] with good chemical stability and excellent optical limiting properties, and its optical responses to nanosecond laser pulses at 532 nm are much stronger than those of [60] fullerene and chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine [12]. It has been used in optical and electronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, photoconductors, and infrared (IR) detec- tors [13,14], and as a superionic conductor [15,16]. It is also used as a photosensitizer for photographic purposes [17]. However, there has been no report on the utilization of a porous Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocatalyst system for environmental purification under visible light irradiation. In this work, visible light-driven Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocatalysts for degradation of organic dyes were obtained ZHU Lei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 254â€“260 by a conventional hydrothermal preparation method. The Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites exhibited new characteristics and properties that were different from those of bulk Ag 2 S and TiO 2 . The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites was assessed by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation and compared with that of pure anatase TiO 2 . 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the photocatalysts 1.1.1 Preparation of Ag 2 S nanoparticles The Ag 2 S nanoparticles were prepared by a precipitation process using AgNO 3 (Duksan Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., Korea) and Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O (Duksan Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., Korea) as precursors. AgNO 3 (1.02 g) was dissolved in 100 ml distilled water, and then 0.003 mol Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O solution was added dropwise into the above solution with sonication at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was vigorous stirred for 6 h, and then the mixture was rinsed and centrifugated with acetone and distilled water several times. After filtration and drying under vacuum at 80 o C, Ag 2 S was obtained as a black powder. 1.1.2 Preparation of porous Ag 2 S/TiO 2 nanocomposite Porous Ag 2 S sensitized TiO 2 nanocomposites were prepared with different molar concentrations of Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O (2, 3, and 4 mmol) by a hydrothermal reaction. The schematic diagram of the synthesis process comprising two parts is shown in Fig. 1. Into 25 ml distilled water containing 0.5 g of titanium oxide, a measured amount of silver nitrate powder was added and ul- trasonicated (using a 750 W, Ultrasonic Processor VCX 750, Korea) for 20 min. The Na 2 S solution was prepared separately and added dropwise to the solution, which was then stirred for at least 8 h at 80 o C. The above solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave that was then sealed. The contents were then heated at 140 o C for 10 h. After the tem- perature of the mixture was brought down to room temperature, the mixture was filtered using Whatman filter paper and washed with distilled water and ethanol five times. Finally, it was dried under vacuum at 100 o C. By using different molar concentrations of Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O, three composite photocatalysts were obtained, and they were denoted a-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 , b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 , and c-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 . The titanium oxide nanopowder (TiO 2 , < 25 nm, 99.7%) with the anatase structure that was used as a control sample was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, USA. 1.2 Characterization of the photocatalysts The morphology of the photocatalysts were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5200 JOEL, Japan) at 3.0 keV equipped with an energy dispersive analysis system of X-ray analysis (EDX). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2010, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used to examine the size distribution of the photocatalysts. The crystallographic structures of the compos- ite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XD-D1, Japan) at room temperature with Cu K radiation ( = 0.154056 nm) and a graphite monochro- mator, which was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. To analyze light absorption by the photocatalysts, UV-Vis diffuse reflec- tance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a scan UV-Vis spec- trophotometer (Neosys-2000) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly. BaSO 4 was used with wavelengths in the 300â€“800 nm range. The BET surface area of the photocatalysts was determined by nitrogen adsorption at â€“196 o C using a BET analyzer (Monosorb, USA). All the samples were degassed at 350 o C before the measurement. The UV-Vis spectra for the MB solution degraded by TiO 2 and the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocatalysts under UV-Vis light irradiation were recorded using a UV-Vis (Optizen Pop Mecasys Co., Ltd., Korea) spec- trometer. 1.3 Photocatalytic activities In the photocatalytic test performed at room temperature, 0.03 g Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite was added into 50 ml of 2.0 Ã— 10 â€“5 mol/L MB (analytical grade, Samchun Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., Korea) solution that was first kept in the dark for 2 h to ensure the adsorption/desorption equilibrium of the organic dye. Commercial anatase TiO 2 was adopted as the reference with which to compare the photocatalytic activity. For irradiation, a visible light lamp (8 W, > 420 nm, KLD-08L LED lamp) was used at the distance of 100 mm from the solution in a darkness AgNO 3 0.5 g TiO 2 Ultrasonication after 30 min Stirring Na 2 S drop wise 8 h filtering washing 100 o C drying sample Fig. 1. Schematic of the synthesis of the porous Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites. ZHU Lei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 254â€“260 box. The first MB sample was taken at the end of the dark adsorption period (just before the light was turned on) and was treated as the starting point (t = 0) of the reaction where the concentration of the MB solution was c 0 . The suspension was irradiated with visible light under magnetic stirring. Samples were then withdrawn regularly from the reactor at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min. These were immediately centrifuged to remove any suspended solid before analysis. The concentration of MB solution (c) during the photocatalytic degradation reac- tion was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the solu- tion samples with the UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Optizen POP) at max = 665 nm [18] using a calibration curve. No reaction byproducts absorb at this wavelength. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization results The typical microscopic surface structure and morphology of the Ag 2 S nanoparticles and Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites were investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2(a) is a typical SEM image from the microscopic rod-shaped Ag 2 S nanoparticles. These were large scale uniform micro-rods with an average diameter of 1.5 nm. A high magnification SEM image is shown in Fig. 2(b), which showed that the porous Ag 2 S nanoparticles had a smooth surface and did not tend to ag- glomerate. This was attributed to that only crystal particles whose size is very small can easily agglomerate due to the weak attractive forces of the surface. Figure 2 (c) and (d) show typical SEM images from a porous Ag 2 S sensitized TiO 2 composite. The average size of the particles is in the nano- scale range. The particles were compact, uniform, and had no cracks and no abnormality, which can be attributed to the growth and densification of porous Ag 2 S particles on TiO 2 in the composite. For a more detailed and higher magnification, the surface nanostructure and particle sizes of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites were examined by TEM. As shown in Fig. 3, the TEM images revealed that unlike TiO 2 , Ag 2 S/TiO 2 displayed well dispersed nanoparticles with an average size of 15â€“20 nm and particle agglomeration was effectively inhibited by the introduction of the porous Ag 2 S nanoparticles. A few black dots can be ob- served in these images that corresponded to deposited Ag 2 S nanoparticles. The presence of a distinct junction between the two crystal phases further confirmed the strong interaction between Ag 2 S and TiO 2 in Ag 2 S/TiO 2 . The surface area is a very important parameter for the effi- ciency of a photocatalyst. This was evaluated for TiO 2 and b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 . The BET surface areas, total pore volumes, and average pore diameters are listed in Table 1. Compared with pure TiO 2 , the surface area, pore volume, and the average pore diameter of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 photocatalysts were increased. The reason was that the plentiful micropores of Ag 2 S were distrib- uted on the outer surface of the TiO 2 . No inside pores of TiO 2 were filled and only parts of the outside pores of TiO 2 were covered. In addition, the small clusters of Ag 2 S particles on the (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 2. SEM images of different samples. (a, b) Ag 2 S; (c, b) Ag 2 S/TiO 2 . 20 nm Fig. 3. TEM micrographs of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite. ZHU Lei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 254â€“260 external surface of TiO 2 had formed some mesopores and macropores. Therefore, Ag 2 S loaded on the TiO 2 did not change the microstructure of the original TiO 2 , and on the contrary its surface area and pore volume were increased. The pore size distribution curves calculated from the nitrogen ad- sorption isotherms by the Barrtee-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method and the corresponding isotherm of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 sample is shown in Fig. 4. The Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites gave Type I isotherms characterized by a plateau that was nearly horizontal to the p/p 0 axis in the middle region, with increas- ing adsorbed volume in the low relative pressure region. The data showed that by using Ag 2 S as a modifier material, the pore size distribution of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites was im- proved. The crystal phase structures of the Ag 2 S, anatase TiO 2 , and Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocatalysts were characterized by XRD measurements (Fig. 5). The TiO 2 in the photocatalysts was the anatase phase, while the Ag 2 S was predominantly the crystalline phases of acanthite. For these three samples, the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), and (204) crystal planes were from the anatase TiO 2 phase while the (111), (112), (121), (103), (031), (200), (213), and (134) crystal planes were from the acanthite Ag 2 S phase [19]. The cell constants were calculated to be a = 0.42261 nm, b = 0.69238 nm, and c = 0.78547 nm (JCPDS 14-0072). No impurity phase was detected. The broadening of these diffraction peaks indicated that the sample was nanosized. The crystalline size of the sample was esti- mated to be 15 nm from the Scherrer equation. These nanocomposite particles were further characterized by EDX, which showed the expected peaks for Ag and S, as well as the peak of Ti due to TiO 2 . Impurity elements such as Na and C also existed, which might be from the experimental process. The contents of the main elements were much more than those of the impurity elements. This indicated that a b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite with high purity has been successfully synthesized in this study. The elemental compositions of Ti, O, Ag, S, and impurity in the b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite photocata- lysts are 50.89%, 35.42%, 8.85%, 4.43%, and 0.41%, respec- tively. UV-Vis reflectance analysis was carried out on the various systems of interest. The measurements were converted to ab- sorbance spectra using the Kubelka-Munk method. Figure 6 shows the UV-Vis diffused reflectance spectra of TiO 2 and b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 . As expected, the spectrum from TiO 2 showed that TiO 2 absorbs mainly ultraviolet light with wavelengths below 400 nm. After the introduction of Ag 2 S, the absorption edge was shifted towards the visible region. The b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 sample exhibited its fundamental absorption edge at 800 nm. The diffuse reflectance spectra of b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 were trans- formed by performing the Kubelka-Munk transformation of the Table 1 Microstructure of TiO 2 and b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite Sample BET surface area (m 2 /g) Total pore volume (cm 3 /g) Average pore diameter (nm) TiO 2 24.78 0.0132 2.1289 b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 112.74 0.2096 7.4367 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 V o l u m e a d s o r b e d ( c m 3 / g ) p/p 0 0 10 20 80 100 0.00 0.02 0.04 ( d V / d D ) / ( c m 3 / ( g n m ) ) Pore diameter (nm) Fig. 4.

ZHU Lei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 254â€“260 measured reflectance by K = (1â€“R) 2 /2R = F(R) where K is the transformed reflectance, R is the reflectance (%), and F(R) is the Kubelka-Munk function [20]. The band gap E g and absorption coefficient are related as hv = A(hvâ€“E g ) 1/2 where , v, E g , and A are the absorption coefficient, light fre- quency, band gap, and a constant, respectively. If the com- pound scatters in a perfectly diffuse manner, K becomes equal to 2 . In this case, we can use the following expression: [F(R)hv] 2 = A(hvâ€“E g ) The estimated E g value was 1.95 eV for the b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 sample. This value was red shifted from the typical E g of TiO 2 (3.2 eV). This result suggested the possibility of using this material as a photocatalyst for degradation processes with lower energetic requirements than TiO 2 . 2.2 Adsorption and photo-decolorization process Since a photo-oxidation reaction takes place at the catalyst surface, the adsorption characteristics of the system are im- portant for the photocatalytic process. The adsorption of MB on the nanocomposite surface was tested using suspensions of MB and Ag 2 S/TiO 2 under dark conditions. The dye adsorbs onto the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composite and after the first two hours, a clear decrease in the MB solution concentration can be seen (Fig. 7(a) for time zero). After this period, adsorp- tion-desorption equilibrium was achieved and no more de- crease in the MB concentration occurred. The ability of the semiconductor phases (Ag 2 S and TiO 2 ) to adsorb MB was also tested using Ag 2 S and TiO 2 particles. The MB adsorbed per- centage was higher for the materials containing Ag 2 S than pure TiO 2 . The adsorbed percentage of MB in the presence of b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 was the highest of the samples. These results are in agreement with other works, and suggest that MB photo- decomposition occur with the dye adsorbed on the catalyst surface [21]. The photocatalytic efficiency of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 materials on the decolorization of MB solution was tested over 150 min (Fig. 7(a)). The intensity of the absorption peaks corresponding to MB gradually diminished with increasing irradiation time. Figure 7(a) also shows the change in the concentration of MB with different irradiation time in the presence of different photocatalysts. The pure TiO 2 had almost no photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of MB solution. The MB solution also degraded only a little on the introducing of Ag 2 S particles. However, the MB molecules were well degraded in the presence of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites. The degradation efficiency of MB under visible light followed the order: b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 > a-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 > c-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 > Ag 2 S > TiO 2 . Clearly, the addition of Ag 2 S in the b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 nanocompo- site should be of an appropriate amount. The photocatalytic activity of b-Ag 2 S/TiO 2 was the best, which was attributed to that the introduction of larger amounts of Ag 2 S onto the TiO 2 surface resulted in most of the surface being covered, thus the performance for MB decolorization was not as good (Fig.7(b)). The enhanced activity was attributed to the improved optical absorption and the heterostructure, which favored the separa- tion of photo-induced electron-hole pairs in the photosensitized titanium dioxide photocatalysts [22â€“26]. The scheme of the excitation and charge transfer process between Ag 2 S and TiO 2 under visible light irradiation is shown in Fig. 8. Under the irradiation by a visible lamp, electrons in Ag 2 S and holes in TiO 2 are generated and migrated to the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2 and valence band (VB) of Ag 2 S, respectively (corre- sponding to Eq.

For each new cycle, the sample was collected and vacuum dried at 100 C for 5 h keeping the other reaction conditions constant. As shown in Fig. 9, after five cycles the decolorization rate decreased only 8%, from 60% to 52%. The slight decrease indicated that the photocatalytic activity of the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 nanocomposites was reproducible. The reduction in the degradation efficiency during the cycles can be ex- plained by the formation of byproducts and their accumulation in the cavities and on the active surface sites of the photo- catalysts. The result was probably due to the decrease of the surface area for both photon absorption and MB adsorption. 3 Conclusions A hydrothermal method with the precipitation reaction of AgNO 3 and Na 2 SÂ·5H 2 O was used to prepare Ag 2 S sensitized TiO 2 composite photocatalysts. The composites were com- posed of an anatase phase and an acanthite Ag 2 S phase. The absorption edge of Ag 2 S/TiO 2 in the UV-Vis absorbance spectra had a pronounced red shift. The Ag 2 S/TiO 2 nanocom- posites had a high surface area, excellent structure, and good optical properties. The visible light photodegradation rates of MB with the Ag 2 S/TiO 2 composites were markedly higher than that of TiO 2 , which was due to the excellent effects of the Ag 2 S semiconductor.

Tel: +82-41-660-1337; Fax: +82-41-688-3352 Porous Ag2S sensitized TiO2 catalysts were synthesized by the hydrothermal process. The crystallization and porous structure of the Ag2S/TiO2 composite photocatalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption. The Ag2S/TiO2 composites were mainly composed of anatase TiO2 and acanthite Ag2S. The absorption edge wavelengths of TiO2 and the Ag2S/TiO2 composite prepared with 3 mmol Na2S·5H2O were 400 and 800 nm, respectively, that is, the absorption edge of the composite had a pronounced red shift. The photocatalytic activity under visible light was investigated by the degradation of methylene blue with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic activities under visible light of the Ag2S/TiO2 photocatalysts were much higher than that of TiO2. Graphical abstract The hydrothermal synthesis and visible light photocatalytic activity of Ag2S/TiO2 catalysts fabricated with Ag2S as photosensitizer are reported. The improved catalytic activity was due to the excellent electrical properties of the Ag2S semiconductor that was well dispersed.
