DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60141-2 Effect of Silylation of SBA-15 on Its Supported Cobalt Catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis SHAN Yuanyuan, LIEW Kongyong, LI Jinlin* Key Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials Science of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China Abstract: Cobalt catalysts supported on unsilylated and silylated SBA-15 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and charac- terized by elemental analysis, N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, H 2 tempera- ture-programmed desorption, and oxygen titration. Their catalytic properties for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor. The results show that the interaction between cobalt and the support was decreased, and the reducibility of the cobalt oxide species was more facile on the silylated Co/SBA-15 catalyst. With increasing (CH 3 ) 3 SiCl loading, the surface coverage of the trimethylsilyl group increased, and the cobalt cluster size was larger. The higher activity of the silylated 10%Co/SBA-15 catalysts was ascribed to its improved reducibility. The increase in selectivity for C 5+ hydrocarbons was attributed to the increase in cobalt cluster size. Key words: silylation; SBA-15; cobalt-based catalyst; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; trimethylsilyl group Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is used to convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen into transportation fuels and chemi- cals [1]. The synthetic fuels produced by FTS have high mo- lecular weights and are straight chain hydrocarbons that can be used as blending stock for transportation fuels derived from crude oil [2]. Cobalt-based FTS catalysts have been widely studied because of their high conversion, high selectivity for heavy hydrocarbons, low water-gas shift activity, and com- paratively low price [3]. In principle, the FTS activity of supported cobalt is pro- portional to the number of surface Co 0 sites on the reduced catalysts. Cobalt dispersion and reducibility are believed to be the important parameters that affect the number of surface cobalt sites, and thus the overall catalytic performance [4,5]. Typically, the reducibility of supported cobalt oxide can be made more facile by the addition of small amounts of noble metals and transition metals, such as Pt [6], Re [7], Ru [8], and Zr [9]. Some advanced methods that can improve the reduci- bility of supported cobalt catalysts have been developed re- cently [10,11]. Cobalt is usually supported on conventional supports such as Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , SiO 2 , and ZrO 2 for the FTS reaction [12–14]. SBA-15 is a highly ordered mesoporous molecular sieve with a narrow pore size distribution of 3–30 nm and large surface area (600–1000 m 2 /g) [15]. SBA-15 has thicker pore walls and higher hydrothermal stability than other silica-based mesoporous materials such as MCM-41. These features make it suitable for use as a support material [16]. It has been sug- gested that surface silanol groups (SiOH) on siliceous materials can interact with cobalt oxides [17,18]. The resulting com- pounds were difficult to reduce at low temperatures. Kim et al. [10] studied the performance of catalysts supported on SBA-15 silylated by (CH 3 ) 3 SiSi(CH 3 ) 3 (HMDS) and found that the silylation enhanced the reducibility of cobalt oxides and in- creased the FTS activity. Martínez et al. [19] synthesized cobalt metal nanoparticles in the core of reverse micelles and sup- ported the nanoparticles on ITQ-2 silylated by HMDS. They found that this preparation approach did not have the disper- sion-reducibility dependence of very small cobalt particles, and these modified carriers led to increased metal dispersion and consequently increased activity. In the present work, we studied silylated SBA-15-supported cobalt catalysts for FTS. The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by SHAN Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1091–1095 elemental analysis, N 2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), H 2 temperature-programmed desorption (H 2 -TPD), and oxygen titration. The effect of the silylation of SBA-15 on the activity and selectivity of the FTS reaction was investigated. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation SBA-15 was synthesized according to a reported procedure [15]. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of P123 (EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 , M AV = 5800, AR, Aldrich) was stirred with 350 ml of 2 mol/L HCl solution at 35 ºC until completely dissolved. This was followed by the dropwise addition of 22.5 g of TEOS (tetraethylortho- silicate, AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd). After stirring at 35 ºC for 24 h, the mixture was charged into a polytetrafluoroethylene bottle and then heated at 100 ºC for 24 h. The precipitate was thoroughly washed with deionized wa- ter, dried at room temperature, and then calcined in air at 550 ºC for 6 h. The procedure for the silylation of SBA-15 was as follows [20]. The synthesized SBA-15 was evacuated at 120 ºC for 6 h to remove the residual water. The SBA-15 (2 g) was dispersed in anhydrous toluene (160 ml). Then (CH 3 ) 3 SiCl (TMCS, AR, Alfa Aesar) was added slowly under stirring. Each mixture was stirred at 80 ºC for 24 h under N 2 atmosphere. The samples were then filtered and washed with toluene and ethanol. Three different amounts of silylation were performed by adding 2, 10, and 20 ml of TMCS into the suspension. The cobalt catalysts supported on silylated and unsilylated SBA-15 (10% cobalt) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using an ethanol solution of cobalt nitrate. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 120 ºC for 12 h and calcined in a flow of air at 450 ºC for 5 h. The samples were named 10%Co/SBA-15-SX with X = 1, 5, and 10, where X denotes the amount (ml) of TMCS added per gram of SBA-15. 1.2 Support and catalyst characterization The carbon contents of the silylated samples were deter- mined with a Vario EL III elemental analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The surface coverage of the trimethylsilyl group was calculated using the equation: surface coverage = (1/3×n c ×N×A TMS ×(10 –9 ) 2 )/A catal , where n c is the mole number of carbon on the surface of support, N is Avogadro’s Number, A TMS is the area of trimethylsilyl group per molecule [21], and A catal is the surface area of catalyst. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at –196 ºC using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 analyzer. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed at 200 ºC for 6 h. The surface area was calculated from the BET equation, and the pore size distribution and pore volumes were determined from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the Bar- rett-Joyner-Halenda method. Small-angle and wide-angle XRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D8 power diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu K . radiation ( = 0.154056 nm). The scan ranges were 0.5°–4° and 20°–80° with 0.002° and 0.016° steps, respectively. Crys- tallite phases were determined by comparing the diffraction patterns with those in the standard JCPDS powder diffraction file. H 2 -TPR experiments were performed with a Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit with a TCD. About 0.04 g of the calcined cata- lyst was placed in a U-shaped tubular quartz reactor and purged with 30 ml/min Ar at 150 ºC for 1 h to remove water, and then cooled to 50 ºC. Then 10%H 2 -90%Ar was introduced to the catalyst at a flow rate of 30 ml/min while the temperature was increased at a rate of 10 ºC/min from 50 to 800 ºC and held at 800 ºC for 0.5 h. H 2 -TPD was also performed using the Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. The catalyst (0.15 g) was reduced by H 2 at 450 ºC for 12 h and cooled under H 2 flow to 100 ºC. The sample was held at 100 ºC for 1 h under Ar flow to remove weakly bonded physisorbed species. The temperature was increased slowly to 450 ºC, and the catalyst was held at this temperature under flowing argon to desorb the remaining chemisorbed H 2 until the TCD signal returned to the baseline. Oxygen pulse reoxidation was also performed with the Zeton Altamira AMI-200 unit. After the H 2 -TPD, the sample was reoxidized at 450 ºC by oxygen pulses into a helium carrier. After oxidation of the cobalt metal particles was completed, the number of moles of oxygen consumed and the percentage reduction were calculated assuming that Co 0 was reoxidized completely to Co 3 O 4 . The calculation of the dispersion and average cluster size assumed that the Co:H stoichiometry was 1:1. The cobalt metal cluster size was estimated assuming spherical cobalt cluster morphology [22]. The uncorrected cluster size and dispersion were calculated based on the total cobalt contained in the sample, and the corrected cluster size and dispersion were reported by reduction percentage. The formula for the calcula- tion has been described previously [23]. 1.3 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction The performance of the catalysts for FTS was tested in a fixed-bed reactor (i.d. = 12 mm). The sample (0.4 g) diluted with 5.0 g of carborundum was placed in the reactor. Prior to the catalytic measurements, the catalysts were reduced at 450 ºC and atmospheric pressure by a flow of high purity H 2 through the reactor at 6 NL/(h·g). After 10 h reduction, the reactor temperature was decreased to 100 ºC under H 2 flow. Synthesis gas with CO/H 2 =1:2 at 8 SL/(h·g) was then intro- SHAN Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1091–1095 duced, and the pressure was increased slowly to 1.5 MPa. The temperature was increased to 215 ºC over 20 h, and the reaction was carried out at 215 ºC. The products were collected in a heated trap (100 ºC) and a cold trap (–2 ºC) in sequence. The outlet gases were analyzed online with an Agilent 300 GC. Activity was reported as CO conversion (X(CO)). C 5+ selec- tivity was calculated by subtracting the amount of C 1 –C 4 hy- drocarbons in the product gas mixture from the total mass balance. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure of the support and catalyst The carbon content and surface coverage of the trimethyl- silyl group are reported in Table 1. It can be seen that the sur- face coverage of the trimethylsilyl group on the silylated catalysts increased with increasing TMCS loading. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for SBA-15 and the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The pure-silica SBA-15 sample displayed a typical IV isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop. There was a sharp increase in the adsorbed amount of N 2 in the relative pressure range p/p 0 = 0.6–0.8. This is characteristic of highly ordered mesoporous materials. For all the Co/SBA-15 catalysts, the N 2 adsorption isotherms were similar to that of the original SBA-15. These indicate that the parent mesopor- ous structure was maintained after silylation and cobalt load- ing. The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter are given in Table 1. The BET surface area and pore volume of SBA-15 decreased after silylation and then de- creased further after cobalt impregnation, which can be attrib- uted to the entry of organic groups and cobalt species into the pores of the support, respectively. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the SBA-15 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that all the patterns had three well-resolved peaks at 2 values between 0.9° and 2°, which can be indexed as the (100), (110), and (200) diffraction planes due to the 2-D hexagonal structure of the original SBA-15. However, compared with the intensity of the (100) diffraction peak of SBA-15, those of the catalysts con- taining cobalt decreased. This could be caused by a partial collapse of the periodic mesoporous structure during cobalt Table 1 N 2 adsorption-desorption data of SBA-15 and 10%Co/SBA-15 catalysts Sample Amont of TMCS a (ml/g) C content (%) Surface coverage (%) A BET /(m 2 /g) V BJH /(cm 3 /g) d BJH /nm SBA-15 — — — 844.1 1.286 6.5 10%Co/SBA-15 — 661.8 1.060 6.5 10%Co/SBA-15-S1 1 1.171 14.93 624.5 0.9635 6.2 10%Co/SBA-15-S5 5 1.434 20.81 548.6 0.9034 6.5 10%Co/SBA-15-S10 10 1.472 23.47 499.3 0.8918 6.5 a Amount of TMCS added per gram of SBA-15. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (3) (2) (1) Vol u me adsorbed p/p 0 (4) (5) Fig. 1.

SHAN Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1091–1095 loading. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the diffraction peaks at 31.2°, 36.8°, 44.8°, 59.4°, and 65.3° corresponded to the face-cen- tered cubic spinel of crystalline Co 3 O 4 (JCPDS PDF No. 42-1467). It is noteworthy that Co 3 O 4 was the primary crystal- line cobalt species present after impregnation and calcination. 2.2 Catalyst reducibility Figure 3 shows the TPR profiles of the unsilylated and silylated Co/SBA-15 catalysts. The TPR profiles show three main reduction peaks centered at 305, 442, and 626 ºC. Ac- cording to the in-situ XRD data in our previous study [24], the low temperature reduction region at 216–323 ºC can be attrib- uted to the reduction of Co 3 O 4 to CoO. The second peak at 323–550 ºC corresponded to the subsequent reduction of CoO to Co 0 . For the unsilylated Co/SBA-15 catalyst, the broad peak at 550–740 ºC can be assigned to the reduction of barely re- ducible cobalt silicate (Co 2 SiO 4 ) formed by a strong interaction between cobalt and the support [25]. After silylation of the SBA-15 surface, the high temperature reduction peak intensity decreased, indicating that the strong interaction between the cobalt species and surface SiOH groups decreased. Kim et al. [10] reported that the intensity of the peak at above 570 ºC increased with the loading of HMDS, while in the present study, the peak intensity at above 550 ºC decreased. The results of H 2 -TPD and O 2 titration are given in Table 2. With increased TMCS loading, the corrected cobalt dispersion decreased, the catalyst reducibility increased, and the corrected cobalt cluster size increased. The reason is probably because the silylation reagent TMCS has reacted with the hydroxyl groups prior to the impregnation of cobalt. This decreased the concentration of the surface SiOH groups, which resulted in a decrease in the interaction between the cobalt species and SBA-15. The decreased interaction led to more facile reduci- bility and reduced the cobalt metal particle size. 2.3 Fischer-Tropsch synthesis activity The catalyst activity and selectivity for FTS are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the activity and selectivity of the catalysts were sensitive to the surface of the silica support. With increasing TMCS loading, the CO conversion increased, methane selectivity decreased, and C 5+ hydrocarbon selectivity had a similar trend to the CO conversion. It has been suggested that the cobalt catalyst activity for FTS was strongly dependent on catalyst reducibility. Khodakov et al. [11] found that the higher reducibility of larger cobalt par- ticles formed in wider pore SBA-15 support led to a higher FTS reaction rate than could be obtained with the smaller pore MCM-41 support.

SHAN Yuanyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(11): 1091–1095 activity of Ru-promoted Co/Al 2 O 3 decreased with catalysts calcined at a high temperature due to a decrease in the number of surface active sites for less reducible catalysts. In the present work, the reducibility of the catalysts increased, and this led to an increase in the FTS reaction activity with the silylated SBA-15-supported cobalt catalysts. This is in agreement with the conclusions of Khodakov et al. [11] and Belambe et al. [26]. The higher C 5+ selectivity and lower CH 4 selectivity for the silylated cobalt catalysts were due to the larger cobalt par- ticle size, which is consistent with the results of Co/ -Al 2 O 3 catalysts [27]. 3 Conclusions Cobalt catalysts supported on SBA-15 silylated by TMCS and their Fischer-Tropsch synthesis activity and selectivity were investigated. The structure of the original support was retained in the silylated SBA-15. Compared with the unsily- lated cobalt catalyst, the silylated catalyst exhibited lower dispersion, higher reducibility, and larger cobalt cluster size. Improved catalysts with higher CO conversion and better C 5+ hydrocarbon selectivity for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were obtained. References 1 Schulz H. Appl Catal, 1999, 186: 3 2 Dai X P, Yu Ch Ch.

RESEARCH PAPER Effect of Silylation of SBA-15 on Its Supported Cobalt Catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Yuanyuan SHAN Kongyong LIEW Jinlin LI * Key Laboratory of Catalysis and Materials Science of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Ministry of Education, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-27-67843016; Fax: +86-27-67842752 Cobalt catalysts supported on unsilylated and silylated SBA-15 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and characterized by elemental analysis, N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, H2 temperature-programmed desorption, and oxygen titration. Their catalytic properties for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis were evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor. The results show that the interaction between cobalt and the support was decreased, and the reducibility of the cobalt oxide species was more facile on the silylated Co/SBA-15 catalyst. With increasing (CH3)3SiCl loading, the surface coverage of the trimethylsilyl group increased, and the cobalt cluster size was larger. The higher activity of the silylated 10%Co/SBA-15 catalysts was ascribed to its improved reducibility. The increase in selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons was attributed to the increase in cobalt cluster size.
