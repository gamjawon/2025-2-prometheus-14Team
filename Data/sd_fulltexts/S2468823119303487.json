Graphical abstract A highly active and robust catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles highly dispersed on zeolite H-beta was developed for transforming furfural into 3-acetyl-1-propanol (3-AP) in good yield (81%)under mild conditions (80 °C, 1 MPa H2). Both the support nature and the preparation methods had significant impacts on the dispersion of Ru, eventually on the yield of 3-AP. Ion-exchange method proved best for obtaining the highly active and selective catalyst for this reaction. Moreover, the catalyst can be regenerated easily by calcination and reduction. This catalyst was further explored for the one-pot conversion of xylose and xylan to 3-AP with a yield of 46% and 31%, respectively, thus opening a new feasible pathway from biomass to valuable fine chemicals. Keywords Biomass Furfural 3-acetyl-1-propanol Carbohydrates Ru-based bifunctional catalysts 1 Introduction Furfural is an important bulk chemical directly produced from biomass. [1,2] The rich chemistry of furfural molecule makes it a good platform for producing various renewable chemicals and fuels. [3–5] For example, through aldol condensation with acetone, levulic acid or other biomass-derived ketones followed by hydrodeoxygenation, C8-C16 alkanes could be produced and potentially used as renewable liquid fuels. [6,7] On the other hand, furfural could also be used for producing fine chemicals which are not easily accessible through traditional fossil feedstocks. For example, through ring-opening and hydrogenation, furfural could be transformed into C5-diols including 1,2-pentanediol, [8–10] 1,4-pentanediol [11] and 1,5-pentanediol, [12,13] which have wide applications in the fields of polymer and cosmetics. In our previous work, [11] we have developed a new pathway for the cascade transformation of furfural to 1,4-pentanediol, in which Ru/CMK-3 was employed as the catalyst and pressurized CO2 in water as the reaction medium. By cooperation between the hydrogenation active site Ru and the acid site which were provided by both the dissolved CO2 and the surface functional group of CMK-3, excellent yield (90%) of 1,4-pentenediol was achieved. Moreover, it was found that this cascade reaction followed a distinctive reaction pathway, that is, furfural was first transformed into 3-acetyl-1-propanol (3-AP), which was further hydrogenated into 1,4-pentanediol. This unique pathway provides a new possibility for the production of 3-AP from furfural via developing novel robust catalysts. 3-AP is an interesting bridge fragment for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, especially for the production of chloroquine, which is one of the most effective medications for both prevention and treatment of malaria [14]. Chloroquine is mainly produced by the condensation of 7-chloroquinoline group and 2-amino-5-diethylaminopentane, where 3-AP is the key fragment to produce 2-amino-5-diethylaminopentane by amination. Currently, 3-AP is synthesized via several processes including hydration of alkynes, selective hydrogenation of carboxylic acids as well as selective oxidation of diols. These processes, however, suffer from the low product yield and high separation cost due to the employment of homogeneous catalysts [15–19]. In this contribution, we report a bifunctional Ru/H-beta catalyst which allows furfural to be selectively converted to 3-AP with a high yield. The effect of Ru particle size as well as the cooperation between solid acid sites and metal hydrogenation capability was also discussed. Finally, we extend this method to the one-pot conversion of xylan and xylose into 3-AP. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials NaY, H-ZSM-5 and H-beta were purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Co. CeO2 was purchased from Sinopharm chemical reagent. SiO2, and Nb2O5 was purchased by Aladdin. Ammonia aqueous was purchased from Damao chemical reagent. Furfural, furfuryl alcohol (FA), cyclopentanone (CPO), cyclopentanol (CPI), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 3-Acetyl-1-propanol (3-AP) were purchased from Aladdin. Xylan was purchased from TCI. D-(+)-xylose was purchased from ACROS Organic. 1,4-pentanediol (1,4-PD) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water was homemade by a Millipore Autopure system. All the reagents were used as received without further purification. Helium (99.99%), hydrogen (99.99%) and carbon dioxide (99.99%) were purchased from Dalian Special Gases Company. 2.2 Catalyst preparation All the oxides supported Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnating the oxides with an aqueous solution of metal salt (RuCl3·H2O). After impregnation, the samples were left at room temperature for 12 h, then dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h, followed by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. Before reaction tests, the samples were reduced in H2 flow at 250 °C for 1 h. Zeolites supported Ru catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange method. Firstly, the zeolites were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h and then transformed into NH4-type by adding the calcined support into 25 ml of 25 wt% NH3·H2O solution and stirring for 22 h. The NH4-zeolites were collected by filtration, washing with hot water and drying at 110 °C for 8 h. The calculated amount of RuCl3 aqueous solution was mixed with 50 ml water for 5 min, then the NH4-zeolites were added into the solution and stirred at 80 °C to evaporate water until drying. The resulting samples were dried at 110 °C for 4 h, followed by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h. The resultant catalysts are denoted as Ru/H-beta-IE. Before the reaction tests, the catalysts were reduced in H2 flow at 250 °C for 1 h. For comparison, the catalyst prepared by impregnation is denoted as Ru/H-beta-IM. 2.3 Catalyst characterization High-angle annual dark-field scan transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analyses were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 F microscope operated at 200 kV. The abreaction-corrected HAADF-STEM images were obtained on a JEM ARM microscope. For all microscopy analysis, the samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and then a drop of the solution was put on copper grid. Temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 equipped with a TCD detector. Prior to the H2-TPR experiment, 100 mg of the sample was loaded into a U-shape quartz reactor and heated at 200 °C under Ar flow (30 mL min−1) for 0.5 h to remove any adsorbed species. Then, after cooling to 50 °C, the flowing gas was switched to 10% H2/Ar flow, and the catalyst was heated to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. During the H2-TPR, the H2 consumption was tracked using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a SDT Q600 instrument with the QSeries software. The experiment was carried out from room temperature to 600 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min under continuous flow of air (100 mL/min). 2.4 Activity evaluation All the reactions were conducted in a 50 mL Parr batch reactor. In a typical experiment, 50 mg catalyst was added to a mixture of H2O (5 mL) and furfural (100 mg, 1.04 mmol). This solution was loaded into the autoclave and the autoclave was flushed with H2 for 3 times. Next, the autoclave was pressurized with H2 to 5 bar. The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C under stirring and held at that temperature for 10 h. After the reaction, the liquid and the solid catalyst were separated by centrifugation, and the liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), with n-pentanol as the internal standard, on an Agilent 7890B equipped with a FID detector (270 °C) and an HP-INNOWAX column (30 m x0.32 mm, 0.5 μm). For the one-pot conversion of xylan (or xylose) into 3-AP, 100 mg xylan or xylose and 5 g water were put into the autoclave and flushed with CO2 for three times. The mixture was heated under CO2 (40 bar) for 10 h at 150 °C. At the end of the reaction the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the pressure was released. Then to this solution was added Ru/H-beta-IE-250 (50 mg). Next, the vessel was pressurized with H2 (10 bar). The mixture was stirred and heated at 80 °C for 10 h. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was recovered by centrifugation, and then analyzed by GC. The conversion of xylan or xylose was determined by analysis of the reaction mixture by HPLC. Note that the molecular weight of xylan was defined as 132n (n represents the degree of polymerization) The yield of furfural was calculated using the following equations: - From xylan Yield of furfural % = n furfural / (m xylan /m anhydropentose) *100 Where: n furfural is the mole of furfural produced. m xylan is the weight of xylan introduced in the reactor. m anhydropentose is the molecular weight of anhydropentose (132 g/mol). The yield of 3-AP was calculated using the following equations: - From furfural Yield of 3-AP% from furfural = n 3-AP/ n furfural *100 Where: n 3-AP is the mole of 3-AP produced. n furfural is the mole of furfural introduced in the reactor. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Support effect Based on the reaction pathway of furfural to 3-AP, both acid sites and metallic sites are indispensable. [11] Therefore, without the catalyst or the presence of Ru, the reaction could not proceed (entry 1–2). First, we investigated the effect of support. As shown in Table 1 , the catalytic performance of Ru nanoparticles was strongly dependent on the support nature. When acidic zeolites (HZSM-5 and H-beta) were used as the supports, the catalysts gave moderate activity and 3-AP selectivity (entry 3–4). In contrast, neither basic or neutral supports could afford 3-AP, instead, furfural alcohol (FA) turned out to be the major product (entry 5–8). It was interesting to note that when acidic oxide Nb2O5 was employed as the support, FA was also the dominant product (entry 9). These results indicate that the acidic zeolite supported Ru catalysts are unique in converting furfural to 3-AP, possibly due to the good balance between acid sites and metallic sites. Considering that the simple impregnation method may lead to poor dispersion of Ru on the zeolite surface, we subsequently used ion-exchange method to prepare the beta-supported Ru catalysts (Ru/H-beta-IE) in order to improve the Ru dispersion. As shown in Table 1 (entry 10–11), the as-prepared catalysts indeed showed enhanced furfural conversion and 3-AP selectivity after pre-reduction at 150–250 °C. HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 1 ) of the Ru/H-beta catalysts prepared with different methods clearly show that the ion-exchange method gave rise to highly and uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles with an average particle size of 1.28 nm; whereas the impregnation method led to non-uniform particles from very large aggregates (tens of nanometers) to finely dispersed nanoparticles. This result clearly corroborates the critical role of metal dispersion in determining the high activity and selectivity. To collect more information on the role of Ru, the influence of pre-reduction treatment was also studied for Ru/H-beta-IE catalysts (Table 1, entries 10–12). Evidently, the un-reduced Ru/H-beta-IE negatively influenced the rate of the hydrogenation step and in this case, an acid-catalyzed reaction occurred dominantly leading to the conversion of furfural to the undesirable side products; no production of 3-AP was observed. In contrast, Ru/H-beta-IE reduced at 150 °C and 250 °C exhibited similar selectivities to 3-AP. Moreover, the Ru/H-beta-IE-250 was significantly more active than Ru/H-beta-IE-150. This result suggested that the Ru/H-beta-IE-250 catalyst had a higher H2 activation ability than Ru/H-beta-IE-150. To prove this point, we conducted H2-TPR experiments. As shown in Fig.2 , the H2-TPR profile of Ru/H-beta-IE presented one major peak centered at 150 °C and a minor peak 525 °C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of RuO2 that was weakly and strongly interacting with the support, respectively. Based on the difference between the actual and theoretical consumptions of H2 (Table 2 ), the reduction degree of the Ru species at 150 °C and 250 °C were calculated to be 43% and 93%, respectively. This result is in good agreement with previous studies. [20] Clearly, the Ru/H-beta-IE-250 catalyst included a much higher percentage of Ru0 than the Ru/H-beta-IE-150 catalyst, which rendered it a higher activity than the latter. 3.2 Effect of reaction parameters Fig. 3 illustrates the furfural conversion and product selectivity as a function of temperature and H2 pressure. The 3-AP selectivity was 13% at complete furfural conversion after 20 h of reaction at 100 °C, and the major side products that competed with 3-AP were 1,4-pentanediol and THFA, which could be produced from further hydrogenation of 3-AP and directly from the over-hydrogenation of furfural. In contrast, a decrease of temperature from 100 to 80 °C gave rise to a 3-AP selectivity as high as 74%. Further decreasing the reaction temperature resulted in a decline of the 3-AP selectivity. The hydrogen pressure dependence of the furfural conversion was similar to the temperature dependence; the selectivity of 3-AP reached a maximum value when the hydrogen pressure was increased to 1 MPa, and then dropped dramatically to less than 10% at the H2 pressure of 2 MPa due to further hydrogenation to 1,4-pentanediol. Under optimal reaction conditions (80 °C, 1 MPa H2), the yield of 3-AP could reach 81% with the full conversion of furfural. 3.3 Reaction pathway On the basis of our experiments, a plausible reaction mechanism is provided in Fig. 4 . First, furfural was unconverted at all in the absence of Ru, which implied that the first step was the hydrogenation of furfural to FA. Then, levulinic acid (LA) was almost stoichiometrically converted to γ-valerolactone (GVL) under identical reaction conditions, which precluded the possibility that LA was the intermediate to 3-AP. Third, it was earlier reported that the aqueous phase rearrangement of 2-furylcarbinols could be achieved under mild reaction conditions. [21,22] Taking these control experiments together and combining our earlier studies on the 1,4-pentanediol synthesis from furfural, [11] we propose that the reaction pathway for the formation 3-AP from furfural involve the following three steps: 1) the hydrogenation of furfural to FA followed by 2) ring-opening/rearrangement of FA and finally 3) the subsequent hydrogenation to 3-AP. 3.4 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the best performance Ru/H-beta-IE-250 catalyst at different reaction times was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5 , in both cases, the percentage of furfural conversion and 3-AP selectivity decreased markedly in the second run. This deactivation was partially caused by the agglomeration of Ru particles. As shown in Fig. 6 , the HAADF-STEM images of the used catalyst revealed that the metal particles had a slight growth from 1.27 nm (fresh) to 2.47 nm (used). In addition to particle growth, humins formation from the thermal polymerization of furfural is another possible reason for activity decline. As shown in Fig. 7 , there was an obvious weight loss in the TGA profile of the reused catalyst. Fortunately, the deactivated catalyst could be regenerated by calcination and reduction; both the conversion and selectivity were recovered completely after the regeneration, indicating that Ru could be re-dispersed and humins could be removed by a simple calcination followed by reduction. 3.5 One-pot conversion of carbohydrates into 3-AP To demonstrate the utility of the Ru/H-beta-IE catalyst in the context of biomass-derived substrates, we evaluated the direct conversion of xylose to 3-AP in a single reactor. Under our optimized conditions (50 mg catalyst and 10 bar hydrogen), no 3-AP was detected although the conversion of xylose was complete. Hence, we investigated the direct conversion of xylose to 3-AP in a single reactor but in a sequential manner. Because the pKa of carbonic acid is enough to catalyze the dehydration of carbohydrates, [23,24] xylose was first heated in water at 150 °C under 40 bar CO2, resulting in the formation of furfural with maximum yield of 61%. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the CO2 was released, the Ru/H-beta-IE and H2 were introduced into the reactor without intermediate purification of the aqueous phase containing furfural. In this manner, furfural was converted into 3-AP in 75% yield (i.e., 46% yield from xylose; Fig. 8 ). The feasibility of directly converting xylan (a natural biopolymer of xylose) into 3-AP was also investigated. After heating xylan in the CO2/H2O system at 150 °C and 40 bar, furfural was produced with 44% yield. Then introduction of Ru/H-beta-IE and H2 into the reactor led to the production of 3-AP with 70% yield based on furfural (corresponding to 31% yield based on xylan) after heating the reactor at 150 °C for 10 h (Fig. 8). These results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first report for the production of 3-AP from carbohydrates under mild reaction conditions. 4 Conclusion We have demonstrated that the bifunctional Ru/H-beta prepared through ion-exchange method was a highly efficient catalyst for the one-pot conversion of furfural to valuable 3-AP. The highest 3-AP yield could reach 81%. The excellent catalytic performance could be attributed to the cooperation between hydrogenation and ring-opening/dehydration functions of the catalyst, as a result of the highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles on the H-beta zeolite. In addition, by a two-step approach in a single reactor, xylose (or xylan) was converted to 3-AP in 46% yield (or 31% yield), thus providing a new and simple way from biomass to valuable chemicals.
