Graphical abstract We introduced the newly-designed bowl-shaped B36 cluster supported single atom catalysts in which the atomic transition metal (TM) can be captured by the electron-deficient hexagonal hole of B36. Among all tested TM@B36 candidates (TM = Ti-Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ir), the Ni@B36 is screened out as a promising catalyst for the 4e− water formation process with an extremely low overpotential of 0.29 V. Keywords First-principles Calculation Oxygen reduction reaction Single-atom catalysts Boron cluster 1 Introduction The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and other electrochemical energy storage devices [1–5]. However, those applications are limited by the utilization of noble metal-based catalysts to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the ORR [6–9]. Up to date, great efforts have been devoted to developing highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the ORR process. Among the alternatives being investigated, the oxides and nitrides of transition metals have been proposed as eligible catalysts or supports due to their excellent stability and electrocatalytic activity [10–12]. However, such catalysts still suffered from low atom efficiency and hindered the construction of structure-activity relationship. On the other hand, single-atom catalysts (SACs), with isolated metal atoms embedded on substrates, have emerged as rising stars in the fields of catalysts, because of the ideal atom economy and tunable electronic properties [13–18]. However, due to the reduced metal particle size and rapid increase in the free energy of the metal surface, agglomeration is likely to occur during preparation and reaction to form clusters, resulting in catalyst deactivation [19]. Thus, finding appropriate supports are in demand to stabilize the atomically dispersed metals. Currently, the metal oxides and two-dimensional non-metal materials (e.g. graphene, silicene, germanene, borophene, and phosphorene, et al.) have been investigated as feasible supports to anchor single atoms [20–33]. Among them, because of the unique geometry and inherent electron-deficient nature, the boron-based nanomaterials (e.g. nanosheets, cages, and clusters) are believed as ideal materials to capture metal atoms and the corresponding SACs have been overall water splitting [34–37], N2 fixation [38,39], CO2 electroreduction [40], et al. In particular, a bowl-like B36 cluster (Fig. 1 ), which has been captured in experiments by Piazza and co-workers [41], has attracted our attention because such a finite sized structure possesses not only unsaturated edge sites but an interior hexagonal hole for anchoring metal atoms. Our previous study demonstrated that the gold atom is preferred to reside in the corner site of B36 and the B36Au can promote a highly active and selective CO2 reduction process to produce formic acid [42]. On the other hand, despite the hexagonal hole of B36 has been proved as a localized electron-poor region and the size of vacancy is feasible for metal doping, studies on the hexagonal hole-supported SACs are still rare. It is of great interest to understand the impact of the interior 6-membmered ring on metal binding and to explore the resultant catalytic performance. Based on those considerations, herein we investigated the binding of transition metals (TMs) on different sites of the bowl-shaped B36 and designed a series of TM-doped-B36 (TM@B36) complexes in which the metal can locate on the center hexagonal hole of B36. Furthermore, we screened out feasible SACs to promote the ORR and elucidated the catalytic mechanisms. In brief, the results suggested that, among a total of twelve candidates (Ti-Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ir doped B36), Ni@B36 can effectively catalyze the reduction of O2 to produce H2O through a 4e− pathway, with a high thermal stability and a low overpotential of 0.29 V. Therefore, we proposed that the B36 supported atomic Ni is a promising catalyst for the ORR process. 2 Computational methods The spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were performed in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [43,44], with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) approach [44,45]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was adopted to describe the interactions among electrons [46]. Empirical DFT-D3 corrections were used to treat the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction [47]. The Brillouin zone was sampled by single gamma-point Monkhorst-Pack meshes for geometry optimization until the maximal residual force was converged to 0.02 eV Å−1. The kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was employed for plane wave expansion and the electronic SCF convergence criterion was set to 10−5 eV. The Gaussian smearing was adopted and the width of the smearing was set to 0.01 eV. All the cluster systems were placed in a cell with lattice parameters of 25 × 25 × 25 Å to avoid the interactions between the two periodic images. The Bader charge population was performed to analyze the charge transfer [48]. Apart from geometrical optimizations, an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations was employed for the most representative catalyst Ni@B36 by utilizing canonical ensemble with a Nosé thermostat and the SMASS was set to be zero. The binding energy (Eb ) is defined as Eb = E(TM@B36) - E(TM) - E(B36), where E(TM) is the energy of a single TM atom. The adsorption energies of adsorbates are calculated by E(ads) = E(total) - E(substrate) - E(adsorbate), where E(adsorbate) indicates the energies of the adsorbate species. The free energy change (ΔG) of each elemental step for the ORR was computed using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model [49]. According to this model, the free energy of H+ + e− is equal to half the chemical potential of H2 molecule and ΔG is calculated by ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE -TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH Where ΔE is the reaction electronic energy directly gained by DFT calculations, ΔEZPE is the zero-point energy correction, TΔS represents the change of entropy at 298.15 K. ΔG U is the free energy related to the electrode potential (U) and ΔG pH = kBT × ln10 × pH, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Here, pH = 0 is set and the value of ΔEZPE -TΔS is set to be 0.4, 0.05 and 0.35 eV for *OOH, *O, and *OH intermediates, respectively, according to previous publications [49–51]. Note that, to evaluate the availability of those thermodynamic corrections of intermediates from literatures, taking the Ni@B36 as an example, we compared the values from literatures and our own frequency calculations. As collected in Table S1 of supporting information (SI), we found the values of ΔEZPE -TΔS of *OOH, *O and *OH from literatures/our own calculations are 0.40/0.38, 0.05/0.03, and 0.35/0.32 eV, respectively. Obviously, such tiny difference in energy implies that the error can be neglected. Therefore, to reduce computational cost, the thermodynamic data in literatures were utilized for all catalytic systems in the present study. In addition, considering the ORR takes place in an aqueous solution, here we evaluated the solvent effect on the Gibbs free energy of the representative Ni@B36-catalytic ORR process. The code of VASPsol was used with a dielectric constant of 78.54 to simulate the H2O solvent environment. As listed in Table S2 of SI, we found the energy difference of ΔG with and without solvent correction is unremarkable (within 0.04 eV) and accordingly, to reduce computational cost, the solvent effect was not taken into account for discussions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening TM@B36 as ORR electrocatalyst Fig. 1 shows the optimized structure of the pristine B36 and the calculated BB bond lengths are in good agreement with a previous study [41]. For the TM@B36 model, three possible binding models (the corner site and the centers of convex and concave faces) were taken into consideration, as shown in Figure S1 of SI. Our results demonstrated that, for all the tested systems, the atomic metals tend to reside in the hub of central hexagonal hole from the convex site to form η6 complexes (Table S3 of SI), which is very different from the case of Au@B36 where the atomic Au prefers to bind in the corner site to form a η1 configuration [42]. Notably, the binding energies of the considered metals are in the range from −2.30 to −6.37 eV, suggesting the formation of TM@B36 is favorable thermodynamically, as shown in Fig. 2 . The strong binding can be attributed to the charge transfer between TM atoms and the B36 substrate on the basis of the Bader charge analysis, as listed in Table S4 of SI. For the representative Ni@B36 which shows excellent catalytic performance as discussed below, the stability was further confirmed by the first-principles molecular dynamics calculations (AIMD), which indicates that the atomic structure of Ni@B36 is maintained through 10 ps simulations at 500 K and the diffusion of atomic Ni to its neighboring site is difficult (Fig. S2 of SI). Next we managed to screen out feasible TM@B36 for the ORR process. It is well known that the adsorption of intermediates *OOH, *O, and *OH along the ORR process (ΔG*OOH, ΔG*O, and ΔG*OH) are of great significance to judge the activity of catalysts. Thus, we calculated the adsorption energy for each species based on the most stable configuration to roughly evaluate the catalytic performance of TM@B36. As displayed in Fig. 3 , linear relationships of ΔG*OOH - ΔG*OH and ΔG*O - ΔG*OH can be clearly detected, indicating that a catalyst with a strong binding of O could also be expected to possess strong interactions of the *OH and *OOH intermediates along the ORR process. Therefore, a desirable catalyst for ORR should have a similar adsorption capacity for the *OOH and *OH species compared with the well-established Pt (111) catalyst [52]. Obviously, Ni@B36 is in the most adjacent position to Pt (111) in Fig. 3. Thus, we deduced Ni@B36 would hold relative high catalytic performance for ORR among these designed catalysts. Moreover, we calculated the free energy change of each elementary step for the ORR along the 4e− pathway and the overpotential was evaluated as well. According to the linear relationship as mentioned, the catalytic activity for the ORR can be assessed as a function of ΔG *O-*OH . This is further confirmed based on the volcano curve [53,54], as shown in Fig. 4 . From the volcano plot, Ni@B36 is found to be the best candidate for the ORR with the minimum overpotential of 0.29 V, which is even lower than that on Pt (111) (0.48 V). Taking advantage of the excellent activity, the ORR mechanisms on Ni@B36 and the catalytic origins would be investigated in detail. 3.2 O2 adsorption First of all, effective O2 adsorption is important to facilitate the subsequent electrochemical steps of the ORR process. Two possible configurations for the adsorption of O2 on Ni atom, namely the end-on and the side-on configurations, as shown in Fig. 5 a, were taken into account. We found that the O2 molecule favors the end-on configuration on Ni@B36 with a more negative adsorption energy of −0.63 eV. For comparison, the side-on configuration displays an adsorption energy of −0.46 eV. According to the Bader charge population analysis, the O2 extracts 0.33 electrons from the catalyst, which would occupy the half-filled 2π* orbitals of O2, resulting in the extension of the OO bond to 1.27 Å from the initial 1.21 Å. Such electron injections from Ni to O2 is essential for the activation of oxygen along the ORR process and can be attributed to the quasi-neutral state of the atomic Ni (+0.12 e, Table S4 of SI) on B36. To gain a deeper understanding on the interaction between the adsorbed O2 and Ni@B36, we analyzed the partial density of states (PDOS) (Fig. 5b), the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) [55–57] (Fig. 5c), and the charge density difference between O2 and Ni@B36 (Fig. 5d). As shown in Fig. 5b, significant hybridization between the Ni 4d and O 2p states near the Fermi level can be detected. This overlap certainly causes charge transfer, which is of great importance to activate the O2, as depicted in Fig. 5d. Overall, the above results suggested strong interactions between the adsorbed O2 and catalyst, which is expected to promote the subsequent electrochemical process. 3.3 Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction Next we focused on the ORR mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 6 , the adsorbed O2 molecule is hydrogenated by interacting with one proton-electron couple and forms an *OOH species adsorbed on the Ni site. The hydrogen binds to the distal O site with a OH bond length of 0.97 Å and the OO bond is further stretched to 1.43 Å. This elementary step is downhill in the free energy profile by 0.94 eV, indicating the formation of *OOH species on Ni@B36 is favorable in energy. Then, the second proton-electron pair would attack the formed *OOH species. In this step, both the two oxygen of *OOH can react with the (H++ e−) pair and the ORR can further proceed two pathways, that is, the 4e− and 2e− routes to generate H2O and H2O2, respectively. In our study, both the reduction pathways were taken into consideration, as shown in Fig. 6. For the 4e− reaction, the (H+ + e−) attacks the distal O atom of the *OOH group, with a water molecule released. The Gibbs free energy decreases by 1.45 eV. Note that, apart from water formation, we also calculated another dissociation mechanism, that is, the formation of a 2e− intermediate with two *OH. Energetically, the free energy change of the reaction *OOH + H+ + e- → 2*OH is -1.22 eV which is less negative and therefore the water formation is more favorable. After the formation of the first H2O molecule, the adsorbed O attaches to the Ni atom, with a Ni-O bond length of 1.70 Å, can be further hydrogenated by another (H+ + e−) couple to form the *OH intermediate. The Ni-O bond is elongated to 1.81 Å and the ΔG of *O reduction to *OH is downhill by 1.47 eV. In the following step, the *OH species is hydrogenated to generate the second H2O by reacting with another proton-electron pair and the ΔG for this step is -1.07 eV. Finally, the second formed H2O molecule is desorbed from the catalyst surface and the entire catalytic cycle is completed. Considering the whole process is spin-polarized, we calculated the spin value of each intermediate along the ORR process and collected in Table S5 of SI. For the 2e− reduction, a H2O2 molecule is produced from the hydrogenation of *OOH and the ΔG of *OOH + e− + H+ → H2O2 is −0.43 eV, which is much less favorable than that in the 4e− pathway (*OOH + e− + H+ → *O + H2O, ΔG =−1.45 eV). By comparing the 4e− and 2e− reactions, it can be concluded that the Ni@B36 catalytic 4e− route toward H2O rather than H2O2 formation is more preferred. To further understand the ORR catalytic performance of Ni@B36 in practice, we discussed the influence of electrode potential (U) on the oxygen reduction reaction. It can be seen from Fig. 7 , though all the ORR steps are downhill at U = 0 V, some steps become uphill with the potential increasing. Motivated, when the U is higher than 0.43 V, the whole 2e− process is uphill in the free energy profile, indicating this path is prohibited energetically. In contrast, all steps of the 4e− process are still exothermic by at least 0.51 V. The limiting potential of the 4e− pathway is 0.94 V. when U is higher than 0.94 V, the potential-determining step of O2 to *OOH would be endothermic. While at U = 0.94 V, the *OOH→HOOH in the 2e− pathway is uphill by a positive ΔG of 0.51 eV, indicating the unfavorable 2e− process is completely overwhelmed by the 4e− pathway. As can be seen, the high selectivity of 4e− pathway occurs on the single Ni atom anchored on the B36 cluster, which is a big advantage for the fuel cell. 4 Conclusion To summarize, we investigated the binding nature between B36 and transition metals and designed a series of TM@B36 SACs in which the atomic metal can be trapped in the central hexagonal hole of B36. Based on that, we studied the mechanisms of TM@B36-promoted ORR processes in theory, suggesting that the Ni@B36 is an eligible catalyst for ORR with a low overpotential and high selectivity toward the formation of water. Since the inherent hexagonal hole is a common structural motif in the nano-boron family (clusters, cages, and sheets), we expect that similar strategies to fabricate SACs can be applied in more boron-based materials for more catalytic reactions.
