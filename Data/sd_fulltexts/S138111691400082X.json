Graphical abstract The catalyst materials are synthesized using carbon-supported cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as the base material modified by pyridine (Py), 2-acid pyridine (AP) and 2-methyl pyridine (MP) (defined as Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C, respectively). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by these catalysts in alkaline solution is investigated by electrochemical methods to quantitatively understand the ORR kinetics. The results show that modification of Py, AP and MP as co-N-precursors can significantly improve the catalytic ORR activity of CoPc/C, and the activity is varied with the order of MP>AP>Py. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) study is conducted in order to examine the surface composition and the possible ORR active sites. The catalytic activities of these catalysts are also validated using an alkaline fuel cell performance, demonstrating these catalysts are promising for fuel cell applications. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Cobalt phthalocyanine Nitrogen modification Membrane-electrode assembly Alkaline membrane fuel cell 1 Introduction It is commonly recognized that polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells would become the effective powers for automotive and stationary applications due to their high energy efficiency and low/zero emissions [1]. In PEM fuel cells, the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been identified as the kinetically dominating reaction when compared to the anode hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Due to the reaction kinetics of O2 electroreduction is much slower than that of H2 oxidation, a much larger cathode overpotential (or polarization) than that of HOR is normally observed, resulting in lower fuel cell performance that that expected even using electrocatalysts to accelerate the ORR process [1–4]. Currently, the feasible and practical ORR catalysts are Pt or Pt alloys-based ones. However, the high the high cost and limited availability of the Pt-based catalysts have been identified as the major barriers in PEM fuel cell commercialization [5,6]. Therefore, developing alternative ORR catalysts such as non-Pt-based or non-noble metal catalysts is the major effort in current PEM fuel cell research and development. Actually, PEM fuel cells can be classified as two categories, one is the acidic PEM fuel cells, and the other is the alkaline PEM fuel cells. Normally, the former is more popular than the later. However, recently the alkaline PEM fuel cells research has recently attracted a noticeable attention due to their distinct advantages when operating in an alkaline environment [7–9]. One of the most advantages when compared to acidic PEM fuel cell is the fast fuel cell reaction kinetics under alkaline conditions, allowing many cost-effective catalysts to be used for cathode ORR [10]. For example, some inexpensive, non-noble metal catalysts such as transition metals, macrocyclic complexes and transition metal chelates with simple nitrogen-containing ligands can be explored for cathode oxygen reduction reaction [10–14]. Regarding non-noble metal catalysts, non-precious cobalt (Co)-based complex materials in alkaline media have been extensively explored for ORR, including Co-phthalocyanine (CoPc), cobalt-fullerene, binary Co–Fe nitrogen containing chelate, Co-polypyrrole, and other cobalt macrocycles [15–17]. Among these Co-based catalyst materials, CoPc complexes have been widely studied because of their high conjugate structure and good chemical stability [18–20]. In particular, they have demonstrated some ORR activity and stability even in their as-prepared form (the molecular form) [6,21,22]. However, the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the macrocycle catalysts are considerably lower than those of Pt-based catalysts, further improvements in both their catalytic activity and stability for ORR are definitely necessary [6]. In addition, as these nitrogen-containing ligands have complex structures, thus their high cost is not avoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the performances of the catalysts by modifying with different materials including more common, simple, and cost-effective nitrogen source and metal [14,15,23]. Most recently, Ding et al. [24] reported on the electrochemical performances of carbon supported CoPc catalyst (CoPc/C) modified with the first-row transition metal elements, M (where M=Fe, Co, Ni, V) as the co-added metal precursors. It was found that the 5wt% of Fe added CoPc catalyst could give improved catalytic ORR activity both in acid and alkaline electrolytes due to the synergistic effect between co-added Fe and CoPc [24]. In this paper the possibility of constituting new electrocatalysts with the modification using N-rich ligand complexes, such as pyridine (Py), 2-acid pyridine (AP) and 2-methyl pyridine (MP) to carbon-supported cobalt phthalocyanine (defined as Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C, respectively) are presented. The activities of these as-prepared catalysts toward ORR were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linera sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. RDE theory and the kinetic parameters such as Tafel slopes were analyzed to address the possible ORR mechanisms. For fundamental understanding, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect surface structure changes and shed some light on the nature of the active centers of the catalyst. At last, these catalysts were employed for the fabrication of MEAs as alternative cathode materials to Pt/C in alkaline H2/O2 fuel cell using Tokuyama A201 membrane. Considering that the manufacturing of the catalysts requires a simple and low cow cost mixture of Py, HP, MP and CoPc on carbon, they would be very attractive for practical applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and catalyst preparation All carbon-supported CoPc/C catalysts modified by pyridine, 2-methyl pyridine, and 2-acid pyridine were prepared via a combined solvent-impregnation and milling procedure at room temperature. The carbon support used in this study was Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (Cabot Corporation, S BET =236.8m2 g−1). Pyridine (Py), 2-acid pyridine (AP) and 2-methyl pyridine (MP) were all analytically pure and used as the co-added N-precursors for CoPc modifications. In order to disperse the catalyst on the surface of Vulcan XC-72R, a mixture of CoPc and carbon black in 20ml methanol was prepared and carefully milled in a mortar for at least 2h, then vacuum dried at 40°C for 1h. During the process, a desired amount of Py, AP or MP was added to the mixture. For a convenient comparison, all catalysts were kept to be 40wt%, i.e., 40wt% N-CoPc catalyst+60wt% Vulcan XC-72 carbon, where the N (N=Py, AP or MP) and the mass ratio of N and CoPc was kept in a 50%:50%. Thus the catalysts studied in this work were designated as 220%Py–20%CoPc/C, 20%AP–20%CoPc/C and 20%MP–20%CoPc/C, respectively. For a better comparison, two baseline samples of carbon supported pure 40%CoPc and 40%Py were also prepared under the same conditions described above. All the above catalysts were all presented as initial loading, and the final loading was not ascertained. 2.2 Physical characterization X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out with a Kratos AXIS UltraDLD electron spectrometer to determine the surface composition with Al K X-ray anode source (hv =1486.6eV) at 250W and 14.0kV. 2.3 Electrode preparation and testing For working electrode preparation, a pre-cleaned rotating disk electrode (RDE) (glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 6.0mm corresponding to a geometric surface area of 0.25cm2, purchased from Pine Instruments) was coated with catalyst to form the catalyst layer. The catalyst ink was prepared by ultrasonically mixing 4.0mg catalyst with 2.0ml of isopropyl alcohol. Then 10μl portion of such ink was then deposited onto the glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode. After dried at room temperature, one drop of methanol/Nafion® solution (50:1wt%) was deposited to adhere the catalyst on GC electrode. The overall loading of the catalyst was 2.8×10−5 gcm−2 for the apparent electrode area of the GC disk (0.25cm2). Therefore, the current densities reported here are all using the geometric area of the carbon electrode. RDE (Pine, 5908 Triangle Drive, Raleigh, NC) measurements were performed in a standard three compartment electrochemical cell at 25°C. A Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. All measured potentials were converted into the values referring to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Electrochemical experiments were carried out in 0.1M KOH solution. For ORR activity measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted between −0.4 and 0.8V at 50mVs−1 in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH solution, and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted between −0.35 and 0.2V at 5mVs−1 in O2-saturated KOH solution at various rotating speeds. The electrolyte was saturated with oxygen for at least 30min before each ORR electrochemical measurement. 2.4 Electrode fabrication and H2/O2 single-cell performance measurements For single cell testing, the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated with commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst (Pt/C) as anode catalyst and Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C or MP-CoPc/C on cathode sides of the Tokuyama polymer membrane (A201 membrane, Tokuyama Corporation, Japan). The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing 40% Pt/C (Johnson Matthey) with a solution of 5wt% Nafion (DuPont) and isopropanol, and then sonicated for 4h to get a homogeneous solution, where the ratio of Pt/C catalyst to Nafion was 3:1. The catalyst ink was sprayed onto the carbon paper (Toray TGP-H-090) to deposit a catalyst layer with a Pt loading of 0.5mgcm−2 for the anode and the Py(AP, MP)-CoPc loading of 1.5mgcm−2 for the cathode. Then three drops of alkaline ionomer, Tokuyama AS-4, were loaded on the catalyst layers. The MEA was fabricated by hot-pressing the sandwich composed of catalyzed anode and cathode carbon papers with A201 membrane in between at a pressure of 10MPa at 70°C for 3min. The MEA was then assembled in a H2/O2 fuel cell with an active area of 4cm2. Pure H2 and O2 were supplied to enter the anode and cathode channels at a flow rate of 100 and 60mlmin−1, respectively, through a humidifier maintained at 25°C under ambient pressure. Polarization curves were obtained using a fuel cell evaluation system (GE/FC1-100). 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Electrochemical activity of CoPc/C catalyst modified with Py, AP and MP toward ORR There has been a general agreement in the literature that heat-treatment can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of the macrocyclic complex catalysts such as phthalocyanine and porphyrins complexes, where the CoPc and FePc complexes are popular non-noble metal catalysts due to their reasonable activity and remarkable selectivity toward ORR in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. On the other hand, they have also demonstrated some ORR activity and stability even in their as-prepared form, i.e., in molecular form [6,21,22]. Fig. 1 shows CV response of O2-saturated 0.1M KOH on three catalysts coated GCs, i.e., 20%Py–20%CoPc/C, 20%AP–20%CoPc/C and 20%MP–20%CoPc/C, respectively. For a comparison, the CV response of pure 40%Py and 40%CoPc are also presented in the figure. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the oxygen reduction peaks can be observed for all of the tested catalyst samples, suggesting that these catalysts all have ORR activity even in their molecular form. Comparatively, the CV of Py/C showed very small oxygen reduction peak (Fig. 1(a)), while CoPc/C showed the obvious oxygen reduction peak position at −0.046V with a peak current of −1.08mAcm−2 (Fig. 1(b)). After modification of CoPc/C with Py, AP or MP as the co-N-precursors, Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C all showed higher ORR activities than that of pure CoPc/C if both their onset potentials and the peak potentials are compared. The oxygen reduction peaks for Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C are at −0.04V, −0.02V and −0.0V which are 6mV, 26mV and 46mV more positive shifts, respectively, when compared to pure CoPc/C. Also, the peak current of Py-Co/C and MP-Co/C are both higher than that of pure CoPc/C except for AP-CoPc/C. Besides, the CV shapes for these three electrodes are very different, indicating that electronic state and local environment of Co atoms in Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C are different from those in CoPc/C. For further clarifying the effect of Py, AP and MP modification on the catalysts’ ORR activity, a comparison of the LSV data on oxygen reduction recorded on GC electrodes modified with different catalyst materials are presented in Fig. 2 . As a typical candidate, the LSV voltammetric curve of Py/C is also added for comparison purposes. From Fig. 2(a), it can be clearly seen that the onset potential of O2 reduction on Py/C is substantially more negative, suggesting almost no active for the ORR. However, the catalytic activity of CoPc/C is greatly improved by addition of Py as co-N-precursor. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the ORR onset potential of Py-CoPc/C catalyst was positively shifted by 210mV compared to that of Py/C catalyst, and even 30mV more positive shift when compared to those of CoPc/C. The ORR half-wave potential, E 1/2, of Py-CoPc/C catalyst is also positively shifted by 150mV and 10mV when compared to those of Py/C and pure CoPc/C, respectively. In order to investigate more details about these non-precious catalysts, similarly, we use AP and MP to replace Py and their ORR activity was examined. Several important electrochemical parameters for the ORR on the different electrodes are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts are both higher active as compared to CoPc/C toward ORR according to their onset potentials (Fig. 2(a) and Table 1). Here, the catalytic activity CoPc/C can be greatly improved with 20%AP and 20%MP loadings which are demonstrated by the observed positive shift of more than 60mV of onset potential compared to that of pure CoPc/C. The same trend can also be observed in E 1/2 values, which are increased from −0.04 for pure CoPc/C to −0.02V and 0.00V for AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C, respectively. The different oxygen reduction behavior on Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts can be found as follows: at the foot of the polarization curves both AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalyst show a higher reduction current than Py-CoPc/C, but at more negative potentials the Py-CoPc/C modified electrode becomes more active. These observations indicate that the ORR activity of CoPc/C catalyst can be greatly improved after the modification with Py, AP and MP as co-N-precursors, and the catalyst activity is entirely determined by the structure of these N-precursors. This ORR enhancement may be attributed to the strong synergistic effect between Py, AP, or MP with CoPc/C, although Py/C, AP/C and MP/C show less electrocatalytic activity for the ORR as Fig. 1(a) showed. It is reported that CoPc on the carbon surface has one possible active site that is central metal ion Co2+ [25]. Adsorption of O2 is formed via the coordinate bond between the O atom of O2 and Co2+. Due to the strong coordination bond, the desorption of the resultant and unreacted O2 from the catalyst becomes very difficult, thus the lower of CoPc/C activity to oxygen reduction. However, when N-donor molecules (N-precursors) are added, the Co of the CoPc complex undergoes axial co-ordination with N-donor molecules [26]. Since N atoms are located in the out ring of the molecules, they could provide more sites for O2 adsorption. The chemisorption of O2 on CoPc can form through π–π interaction between the delocalized π electrons of O2 and delocalized π electrons of N-donors [27]. Therefore, it is easy for both the adsorption of O2 and the desorption of resultant and un-reacted O2 from the catalyst, leading to the improved ORR catalytic activity of the catalyst. Obviously, in this work the axial co-ordination are formed between Co of the CoPc complex with Py, AP or MP as N-donor molecules, thus the improved ORR catalytic activity of CoPc/C as observed above. Tafel plot would be interesting to see how the Tafel slope changes with different catalyst electrodes. This could reflect a change in mechanism if differences are found. Fig. 2(b) presents the mass-corrected Tafel plots of log j k (mAcm−2) vs. the electrode potential E for the ORR on the Py/C, CoPc/C, Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts, respectively, in an O2-saturated 0.1M KOH. These Tafel curves were deduced from the polarization curves of Fig. 2(a) with a rotation rate of 1500rpm. In general, Tafel slopes for all the tested catalyst samples can be divided into two parts: one is in low current density region (E >−0.0V), the other is in high current density region (E <−0.1V). The activity difference of CoPc/C after modifications with Py, AP and MP as co-N-precursors can be clearly identified from Tafel plot in the low current density region. As shown in Table 1, the Tafel slopes for Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts are calculated to be 71, 70.2 and 68.8mVdec−1, respectively, which are all lower than that of pure CoPc/C catalyst with a Tafel slope of 78mVdec−1 and pure Py/C catalyst with a Tafel slope of 101.4mVdec−1. These data clearly indicate that the ORR mechanism strongly depends on the materials investigated in this work, that is, the structure of the co-added N-precursor appeared as a crucial factor for the ORR activity, as also put in evidence by the different number of electrons involved in the ORR, which will be discussed thoroughly below. 3.2 Kinetic study of the ORR on CoPc/C catalyst modified with Py, AP and MP To further clarifying the mechanism of Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts toward ORR, the rotating-disk electrode (RDE) measurements on these electrodes were further performed at various rotation rates in 0.1M KOH. As discussed above, the ORR activity of Py-CoPc/C and AP-CoPc/C electrode is similar to the MP-CoPc/C electrode, therefore, we only give RDE steady-state polarization curves for the ORR on MP-CoPc/C catalyst as representative. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the limiting current density increased with increasing rotation rate due to forced oxygen diffusion from solution to the electrode surface, while the onset potential for ORR remains unchanged on the same catalyst. The catalysts measured in 0.1M KOH shows a relatively well-defined diffusion-limiting current plateau in the potential range of −0.35 to −0.1V, which suggests that the distribution of active sites is uniform [11]. Rotating the electrode at different rates accounts for the mass transfer effect of oxygen diffusion so that the pure kinetic current can be calculated to provide a true measure of catalyst performance at a given potential. If assuming the ORR reaction order is one for the catalysts, the Kouteckye–Levich (K–L) equation thus can be written as [28]: (1) j k = j j d j d − j (2) j d = B ω 1 / 2 (3) B = 0.2 n F S C O 2 D O 2 2 / 3 ν − 1 / 6 where j is the measured current density, j k and j d are the kinetic and diffusion-limited current densities, respectively. n represents the number of apparent electrons transferred per oxygen molecule, B is the Levich slope, ω is the electrode rotation rate, F is Faraday constant, S is the electrode surface area, D O is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in different electrolytes, ν is the kinetic viscosity and C O is the bulk concentration of oxygen. It is known that the electrochemical reduction of oxygen is a multi electron reaction that has two main possible pathways: one involving gain of 2e− to produce H2O2, and the other, a direct 4e− pathway to produce water. To obtain maximum energy capacity, it is highly desirable to reduce oxygen via the 4e− pathway. According to the K–L equation and the results of Fig. 3(b)–(d), the K–L plots of j −1 vs. ω −1/2 at fixed three potentials (−0.35, −0.30 and −0.25V) can be obtained. The transferred apparent electron number, n, per oxygen molecule on Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C electrodes are calculated to be an average value of 2.36, 2.40 and 2.42, respectively. These values are much better than that, where n is determined to be 1.96 for pure CoPc/C electrode in this work (the plot was not provided), which is in a well agreement with what was reported elsewhere [21,29]. Therefore, it can be seen that although the oxygen reduction catalyzed on Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C electrodes are still 2e− reduction process, the selectivity for the ORR on these three electrodes is greatly improved. In other words, the production of amount of H2O2 is hindered to some extent on CoPc/C electrode after modifications with of Py, AP and MP, respectively, in which the addition of MP as co-N-precursor provides the best ORR performance. 3.3 The active sites study of CoPc/C catalyst modified with Py, AP and MP XPS analyses were conducted (Fig. 4 )to obtain the information on the chemical states of element N in Py-CoPc/C, PA-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts. As widely reported in literatures [30,31], the XPS peaks of N 1s at 398.6±0.3, 399.4± 0.3, 400.5±0.3, 401.3±0.3 and 403.3±0.3eV can be assigned to the pyridinic-N, pyridinic-N–H, pyrrolic-N and/or NOx species (caused by oxidation from air exposure), graphitic-N and pyridine-N-oxide, respectively. Among these peaks of N 1s, pyridinic-N and graphitic-N play critical roles in determining the electrocatalytic ORR activity and stability of macrocycles [33–34]. By contrast, the pyridinic-N–H, pyrrolic-N and pyridine-N-oxide seem useless in improving the ORR activity of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the N 1s band for Py-CoPc/C catalyst can be converted into three peaks (marked NI, NII and NIII), corresponding to pyridinic-N (398.7eV), pyridinic-N–H (399.4eV) and graphitic-N (401.5eV), respectively. To our interesting, the N 1s peaks at 398.7eV and 401.5eV, which can be attributed to pyridinic-N and graphitic-N for the catalyst samples, are not the same as reported elsewhere, where instead ethylenediamine (EDA) [32,35], 2,3,5,6-tetra(2-pyridyl)pyrazine [33], and phthalocyanine [36] were used as the N-donors in their molecular forms, but similar to the results as Qiao et al. reported [37,38]. These data suggests that after functionalized by Py, possible interactions may occur between the N of Py and CoPc, accompanied by an electron transfer from the Co-atoms to N-atoms to form pyridinic and graphitic Co–N species. At present, the details for this interaction is not very clear and needs further investigation. The same situations were observed for AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts. It is noted that when Py was replaced by AP and MP for CoPc/C modifications, the pyridinic-N band increased and became significantly sharper at MP-CoPc/C catalyst, suggesting that MP-CoPc/C catalyst should give higher activity than the Py-CoPc/C and AP-CoPc/C catalysts. This is indeed the situation observed as discussed above. 3.4 Single cell performance To validate these catalysts, Fig. 5 shows the power performance of MEAs fabricated with Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C cathode electrocatalysts using humidified H2 and O2 gases at room temperature in a single alkaline PEM fuel cell. In order to compare the performance of these non-noble metal catalysts, the MEA with pure CoPc/C catalyst was also evaluated at the same measuring conditions. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the CoPc/C catalyst showed a power density of 8.6 mWcm−2 with open circuit voltage (OCV) around 0.61V. However, for Py-CoPc/C catalyst under the same conditions, a maximum power density of 20mWcm−2 is achieved, which is two times higher than that of CoPc/C. The OCV value is also increased to 0.86V. For MEAs with AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C, the power density can be further increased to 21.7mWcm−2 with OCV values around 0.87V. Compared to Py-CoPc/C catalyst with a maximum current density of 81mAcm−2, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C give the maximum current densities of 73mAcm−2 and 75mAcm−2, which is in a well agreement with the ORR results obtained above. It should be mentioned that the MEA fabrication conditions are not optimized. The poor chemical compatibility between the ionomer used (Nafion® ionomer) in the electrodes and the quaternary ammonium-type composite membrane (Tokuyama@ membrane, # A201) is likely to cause the high contact resistances and poor MEA lamination. However, these initial results are very promising, which provides more useful information especially for the design of novel N-doped catalysts with high performances. 4 Conclusions Carbon-supported non-noble metal electrocatalysts namely N-CoPc/C (N=Py, AP and MP as the co-added N-precursor) were synthesized with 40% loading (20%N+20%CoPc) through a simple solvent-impregnation and milling procedure. These non-noble metal catalysts were evaluated toward the ORR using RDE technique in 0.1M KOH. It was found that ORR catalytic activity of CoPc/C was significantly improved after modifications with Py, AP and MP. XPS analysis indicated that both pyridinic-N and graphitic-N structure were existed in Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C catalysts, where the pyridinic-N structure may be dominantly responsible for the enhanced ORR activity. MP-CoPc/C showed the most amount of pyridinic-N, thus leading to the most active ORR catalyst. Membrane electrode assemblies were fabricated using the catalysts-based catalyst layers and Tokuyama@ alkaline membrane Tokuyama@ membrane (# A201). The H2/O2 fuel cell performance of the MEAs with Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C cathode gave the power densities around 21.7mWcm−2 at room temperature, which was more than 2-fold of pure CoPc/C. Further work is in progress to optimize the operating conditions to improve the performance, such as using quaternary ammonium-type ionomer for electrode fabrication, optimization of the catalyst loading, hot pressing procedures (temperature and pressure) and operating at elevated temperatures.

        "dc:description": "The catalyst materials are synthesized using carbon-supported cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as the base material modified by pyridine (Py), 2-acid pyridine (AP) and 2-methyl pyridine (MP) (defined as Py-CoPc/C, AP-CoPc/C and MP-CoPc/C, respectively). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by these catalysts in alkaline solution is investigated by electrochemical methods to quantitatively understand the ORR kinetics. The results show that modification of Py, AP and MP as co-N-precursors can significantly improve the catalytic ORR activity of CoPc/C, and the activity is varied with the order of MP>AP>Py. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) study is conducted in order to examine the surface composition and the possible ORR active sites. The catalytic activities of these catalysts are also validated using an alkaline fuel cell performance, demonstrating these catalysts are promising for fuel cell applications.",
