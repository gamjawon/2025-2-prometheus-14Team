In general, the oxide and nitride catalysts produce more condensation of 2-octylamine to higher molecular weight products, mostly containing nitrogen, than elimination to produce octenes and ammonia. Alcohols and amines give significantly different octene isomer distributions; however, the distribution from each reactant is similar for the nitride and oxide catalysts. Key words: nitrides; hydrodenitrogenation; octylamine conversion; oxides; 1. Introduction Denitrogenation is becoming a more important consideration for the upgrading of petroleum to transportation fuels. While hydrodesulfurization has been the subject of much study for many years, hydrodenitrogenation has received much less attention. The work done to date indicates that the most likely mechanism for hydrodenitrogenation is through hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis to produce a saturated alkyl or cycloalkyl amine. The amine then undergoes elimination of ammonia as the reaction that removes nitrogen to form the hydrocarbon. It is therefore of interest to consider the reactions that a saturated amine undergoes over potential hydrotreating catalysts and their support material. The conversion of amines over solid catalysts is complicated because of the possibility of several elimination reactions. As shown below, amines form an alkene by deamination and by condensation to produce secondary (RZNH) and tertiary R3N amines [ 1 ] . Deami- *Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 1-606) 2570251, fax.

Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)11-27 nation can be considered irreversible under the reaction conditions used, but the substituted amines may undergo further reactions: RNHz -> NH3 + alkene (1 a) 2RNH2 - R2 NH + NH3 (1 b ) 3RNH2 - R3 N + 2NH3 (1 c ) R2 NH - RNH + alkene (2 ) R3 N - RZ NH + alkene (3 ) Only a few materials have been used as catalysts for the deamination of amines. Brey and Cobbledick [ 2 ] studied the conversion of 1-butylamine over alumina. They postulated that N-butylidenebutylamine was formed by the dehydrogenation of dibutylamine, a product (RZNH) shown in the above reaction scheme, and butyronitrile was formed by the dehydrogenation of butylamine or decomposition of N-butylidenebutylamine. These authors did not find tributylamine in the products. However, their study was carried out before the development of gas chromatography so that they used infrared spectroscopy for the analysis of their products; it is possible that this product was present but was overlooked. With an alumina catalyst, the decomposition rate of dicyclohexylamine was found to decrease rapidly with increasing conversion, whereas the rate of cyclohexylamine conversion increases with increasing conversion [ 3 ] . The intermediate product, N-cyclohexylidenecyclohexylamine, decomposed rapidly to an alkene and the cyclohexylideneimine. In this study, a cyclic intermediate was postulated to explain the increase in reactivity of amines with secondary alkyl groups. For the deamination of alkylamines to alkenes over alumina, it has been found that Langmuir-Hinshelwood adsorption, assuming a surface reaction on a single center as the rate-determining step, was applicable in most cases. Thus, Pasek et al. [3] found that cyclohexylamine conversion followed zero order kinetics whereas dicyclohexylamine conversion followed first order kinetics. Later it was found that the conversion of both ethylamine and diethylamine to produce an alkene and disproportionation of diethylamine over y-alumina followed zero order kinetics. The reaction rate for triethylamine was independent of partial pressure only at higher pressures [4] . In a study of the condensation of aniline to diphenylamine, it was determined that the reaction rate was first order [ 5 ] . For the deamination of triethylamine and diisopropylamine on y-alumina, the superposition of two simultaneous processes was suggested; one was zero order and the other was first order [ 6] . In a study of the effect of weakly basic aniline on the deamination and the disproportionation of diethylamine and diisopropylamine over y-alumina, Hogan and Pagek [7] obtained an equation that involved the assumption of Langmuir dependence of adsorption of both amines separately on the acidic and basic sites. Catry and Jungers [8] determined that the condensation of primary to secondary amines follows second order kinetics whereas conversion of a series of amines follows first order kinetics. Recently, Volpe and Boudart [9] have prepared M02N and WZN with surface areas as high as 220 and 91 m2/g, respectively, by temperature-programmed reactions between the corresponding oxides and ammonia. Oyama et al. [ 10] summarized some of the factors involved in the preparation of early transition-metal carbides and nitrides. Oyama et al. J.H. Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)11-27 13 [ 10] found that the M02N catalyst was as active for hydrodenitrogenation as a commercial sulfided Ni-Mo/A1203 catalyst. Following the procedures outlined by the above authors, Lee et al. [ 11,12] were able to prepare high surface area nitrides of Mo, W, and V and these were utilized for the conversion of 2-octanol. These materials are also receiving attention for the conversion of N, S and/or O heterocompounds (e.g., [ 13-15] ). The elimination of nitrogen with the Co-Mo-alumina catalyst is postulated to occur in three steps, as illustrated by the reactions shown below for quinoline: -- coo r - O-C-C-C (4) NHZ C-C-C ~C-C-C IOL: NH2 NHZ ( ) ~/''' c-c-c c-c-c L JVNH= ~0 . NH' (6) VThe first step involves the hydrogenation of the nitrogen containing ring and the hydrogenolysis (or pyrolysis plus hydrogenation) of the ring carbon/nitrogen bond to produce a substituted aniline. The second step involves the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring of the nitrogen containing compound (for a single ring compound this would be the first step). In the third step, it is proposed that a proton supplied by the support adds to the amine group, giving the singly or multiply substituted ammonium ion, and this is followed by a Hoffmann type elimination to produce ammonia and the carbenium ion [ 16,17]. The carbenium ion loses a proton to produce an alkene which is subsequently hydrogenated. It was therefore of interest to compare a group of metal oxide and metal nitride catalysts for the deamination of an amine (reaction 6) and this manuscript reports results of such a study. 2. Experimental The source or preparation of the metal oxide and nitride catalysts has been described [ 11,12] . The oxide catalysts were prepared by precipitation by the addition of ammonium hydroxide or nitric acid to produce the metal hydroxide or hydrous metal oxide. As an example, an iron oxide sample was prepared by precipitation from a nitrate solution (1 M) by rapidly adding an excess of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The gel was collected, washed by repeated redispersion-filtration cycles (about 10 times), dried at 120 and then calcined in air at 300 for 5 h. The surface areas of the catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The general preparative procedure for the metal nitride was to treat the metal oxide with ammonia at a particular heating rate [9,10]. To prepare the iron nitride, a modification of this approach was used. The a-Fe203 produced as described above was packed into a quartz tube between quartz wool. The sample was reduced in hydrogen at 425 for 18 h and then nitrided in an ammonia flow (about 800 h') at 350 for 6 h. The nitride that was produced was identified from the X-ray diffraction pattern as ~-Fe2N. The reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure in an integral fixed-bed plug-flow reactor with the catalyst, supported on quartz wool, placed at the middle of the reactor. Pyrex glass beads placed above the catalyst served as a preheater. The catalyst was pretreated in situ at 400-500 for 16 h in a flow of gas - nitrogen for the nitride catalysts and oxygen 14 J.K Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General Ill (1994)11-27 Table 1 Surface areas of the oxide and nitride catalysts before and after use for the conversion of 2-octylantine Catalyst Surface area Initial After use in conversion of 2-octylamine (m2/ (M2/g) g) M02N 152 134 WZN 55 42 VN 52 48 Fe2N 3.6 4.6 Moo, 6.4 5.4 WO3 11 11 Vzos 4.8 35 Fe203 64 21 for the oxide catalysts. Following the pretreatment, the reactor was cooled to the reaction temperature when the pretreatment gas flow was replaced by a flow of the reactant, except when oxygen was used as the pretreatment gas, nitrogen gas was allowed to flow into the reactor for at least 5 min before the reactant feed was initiated. Runs were made at atmospheric pressure without carrier gas. The products were collected during the intervals between the points shown in the figures and were analyzed (area-%) using a DB-5 fused silica capillary column (5% phenyl, and 95% methyl silicone; 0.32 mm I.D., 60 m long). Specific compounds were identified by the injection of standards and/or by analysis using gas chromatography /mass spectrometry. When a series of runs was made with the same catalyst to vary the reaction conditions, the system was purged with nitrogen gas between each run. The reactor was cooled to room temperature in flowing nitrogen before removing the catalyst. The catalyst was stored under nitrogen until portions of the sample were used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) and surface area (BET method) measurements and for elemental analysis. C, N and H were determined using standard instruments for the analysis of these elements. The metal content was obtained by dissolving the material in acid or by fusing with an alkali and then dissolving the resulting mass before determining the metal content using inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. Oxygen was determined by difference. 3. Results Conversion data for 2-octylamine at 360 was obtained for a series of oxide and nitride catalysts (Table 2). To investigate the possibility of the occurrence of gas-phase reactions due to thermal reactions, reactor walls or the preheater material, experiments were carried out without a catalyst. In the temperature ranges studied (up to 350) with the alcohols, the amount of products other than the reactant were too small to detect. For blank runs with 2-octylamine at 360, about 2 wt.-% di-2-octylamine was obtained as the only measurable J.H.

Reproducibility was checked experimentally by repeat runs with different portions of a catalyst. Repeat conversions were reproducible within 1 to 2% (i.e., 20 2%) . Mass balance was determined by adding an internal standard for selected runs. The products that were obtained are defined in scheme 1. In addition to the major products identified in the reaction scheme, a number of other products were formed, usually in a smaller amount than the major products. A typical gas chromatogram of the products from the conversion of 2-octylamine are shown in Fig. 1 for the run using the iron oxide catalyst. The initial grouping of peaks correspond to, in order of increasing retention times: A, 1-octene, n-octane, trans-2-octene, and cis-2-octene; B, 1- and 2-nonene; C, CA 3C(=NH)CH3, unidentified compound, and 2-octylamine; D, octylidene octylamine (C6H13C(CH3)=NCH(CH3)C6H13 (or a di-2octylamine which elutes at a slightly longer time for other runs); D', an isomer of octylidene octylamine (this peak elutes shortly after the di-2-octylamine peak); E, octene dimers; F, a group of peaks eluting after the group of peaks corresponding to octene dimers, and tentatively identified as methyl substituted octene dimers; and G, a group of peaks tentatively identified as octene trimers containing a methyl group (or alternatively a C=NH group). Preliminary studies with 2-octylamine using WZN at temperatures of about 300 showed little conversion at space velocities (LHSV) in the range 0.1 to 1.0 h'. The conversion of 2-octylamine is therefore much slower than the dehydration of 2-octanol (Table 3 [ 19] ); thus, a temperature of 360 and a lower space velocity were required to obtain suitable conversion with the nitride catalyst. In contrast to the other metal nitride catalysts, VN was not highly selective for the dehydration reaction. The formation of 2-octanone parallels that of n-octane. If the 2- 16 J.H.

However, it appears that this is the case since the ratio decreases at the higher flow rates. The selectivity for this catalyst appears to be quite complex since the dehydration selectivity appears to increase with conversion; this implies that the hydrogen transfer is a higher order reaction than dehydration is (Fig. 3). This suggests that much of the hydrogen transfer is a bimolecular reaction where hydrogen transfer occurs from an adsorbed 2-octanol as it converts to 2octanone and an adsorbed octene before it desorbs from the surface. As the alcohol partial pressure decreases with increasing conversion, the surface coverage will decrease so that the probability of an alcohol being adsorbed at a site adjacent to the octene as it is formed will decrease with conversion [ 11,12] . The dependence of the dehydration selectivity with 2-octanol conversion is shown in Fig. 4, and again reflects the dependence of dehydration selectivity upon conversion. For the conversion of 2-octylamine with the tungsten nitride catalyst, about half of the product was di-2-octylamine; elimination of ammonia to produce a mixture of octenes and n-octane accounted for about 15%a of the conversion (Fig. 5). n-Octane was not a primary J.H.

Similar to the conversion of 2-octanol, the major octene product was cis-2-octene (Table 2). The W03 catalyst, following pretreatment with oxygen at 500, was more selective for deamination than the nitride catalyst was. About the same amount of octenes and di-2octylamine were formed (Fig. 6). The octene distribution was essentially identical to the one obtained for the conversion of 2-octylamine with WZN. Just as with the conversion of 2-octanol, the catalyst was altered by a chemical reaction during the course of the run; however, this change did not have much of an impact upon the activity or the selectivity for 2-octylamine conversion. During the reaction the catalyst became blue, and presumably formed a reduced oxide. The XRD pattern following the run was different from that of the initial material. The XRD pattern for the used catalyst could not be matched to any pattern in the reference powder diffraction file. The color of the used catalyst suggests that a \"blue oxide of tungsten\" was formed, and the chemical analysis was consistent with this. The chemical composition was approximately WOz,7, and the solid contained an insignificant amount of C, H, and N. The product distribution from the conversion of 2-octylamine with VN was different from that obtained with WZN with respect to the relative amounts of octene and secondary amine (Fig. 7), with the deamination products dominating.

Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)11-27 23 accounted for about 80% of the n-octane plus octene products. The octene products differed slightly from those obtained with W2N; however, 1-octene was again the dominant product with somewhat more of the cis-2-octene being formed than traps-2-octene with the vanadium nitride catalyst. With this catalyst the major products were higher molecular weight components; of these the major compound was octylidene octylamine. Thus, rather than obtaining the di-2-octylamine, the dehydrogenated form of this compound was obtained. The catalytic behavior of VZOS resembled VN for the conversion of 2-octylamine. With the oxide catalyst the total conversion increased with time (Fig. 8). The major fraction of the deamination products was n-octane, and the octene distribution was essentially the same as those produced with the VN catalyst. The starting catalytic material changed during the reaction. The used catalyst appeared less crystalline than the starting V205, and the increase in the surface area was consistent with this (Table 1). The XRD pattern could be characterized as V203. The chemical analysis of the used catalyst indicated that it reacted with the hydrocarbon products since the chemical analysis data was consistent with an empirical formula of approximately VCO_4HO.402.R. The catalyst must therefore have much of the CHs species as coke on the catalyst. M02N was also active for the conversion of 2-octylamine; during the run the product selectivity changed even though the activity based on 2-octylamine conversion remained constant. With time-on-stream the fraction of the higher carbon number compounds increased, and the n-octane/octene fraction decreased (Fig. 9). With this catalyst n-octane was a minor product compared to the octenes; initially 1-octene accounted for about 60% 100 90 80 70 o 60 0 a 50 o 40 30 20 10 o- 0 e 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Time, Hr Fig. 10.

Lee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)11-27 of the octenes and this gradually increased so that after 6 h 1-octene accounted for more than 80% of the octene isomers. In agreement with the small amount of n-octane, the dimer product was di-2-octylamine rather than octylidene octylamine. The M003 catalyst was active for the conversion of 2-octylamine; however, with this catalyst little deamination occurred so that the major product was the secondary amine, di2-octylamine. This catalyst produced only about 10% of products other than n-octane/ octene and di-2-octylamine; this was a smaller amount of other products than was produced by either the VN or W2N catalyst. As with V205, the M003 underwent reduction during the reaction. It was not possible to match the XRD pattern of the used catalyst with any of the compounds that we found in the literature. As with Vz05, carbon and hydrogen were incorporated into the catalyst (presumably as coke) during usage so that the chemical analysis of the used catalyst corresponded to an empirical formula of MOCo.,Ho.302.0. Thus, the XRD data showed that for the WZN, M02N and VN catalysts, the bulk nitrides did not undergo sufficient change during the conversion of 2-octylamine to cause a detectable difference between the X-ray patterns of the fresh and used catalyst. This was not the case with the oxide catalysts, all of which underwent reduction. It appeared that the tungsten oxide catalyst was only reduced to the blue oxide but that both the vanadium and molybdenum oxide catalysts incorporated both carbon and hydrogen (presumably as coke) as well an undergoing reduction. The Fe2N catalyst was less active for the conversion of 2-octylamine than the above three nitride catalysts. Di-2-octylamine accounted for more than 75% of the total products (Fig. 10). Initially about equal amounts of the 1- and the two 2-octene isomers were formed; however the 1-octene fraction increased with time so that after three hours 1-octene 1-OCTENE M00,~ ------- Q9LM \", Fb03,. . k FIy2N'' __________ ______ ,x_______ ______ Fig. 11.

Gee et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General]] 1 (1994)11-27 25 accounted for about 50% of the octenes and remained constant during the remainder of the run. The iron nitride catalyst was not stable under the reaction conditions. Following use, the XRD pattern of the catalyst had peaks at 20 up to 59that agreed with those of orthorhombic Fe3C;there were additional peaks above 59that were not identified. According to elemental analysis, the empirical formula of the used catalyst was FeCo.380o.t2; the atomic ratio of Fe to C is very close to 3:1 as expected for Fe3C that was identified by XRD. The Fe203 catalyst was more active for the conversion of 2-octylamine than Fe2N was. However, the oxide produced less than 5% of n-octane and octenes; about equal amounts of di-2-octylamine and products with a molecular weight greater than the secondary amine were formed. 1-Octene accounted for about 80% of the octene isomers, and was constant during the run. The XRD pattern indicated that the iron oxide catalyst was reduced to Fe304 and iron metal during use; in addition, a very small amount of a third unidentified compound may have been formed during the course of the reaction. The metal nitride and oxide catalysts exhibit similar alkene selectivities for the elimination reactions for 2-octylamine (Fig. 11) . The pattern shown in Fig. 11 is similar to one that was obtained for some of the metal oxide catalysts for the conversion of 2-octanol [ 18]. Those oxides that gave the pattern shown in Fig. 12 were postulated to do so because of their base strength with the stronger bases being more selective for the formation of 1octene. However, tungsten and molybdenum oxides did not fit this pattern. In fact, for the conversion of 2-octanol, the metal oxides and the nitrides give similar selectivities (Fig. 12) that differ significantly from those shown in Fig. 11 for 2-octylamine.

One factor appears to reside in the solid and is essentially the same for both the oxide and nitride. The other factor resides in the reactant and there are significant differences for elimination from the alcohol and the amine. Thus, it appears that there are two general elimination pathways as illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. For the alcohol conversion, it was postulated that the size of the metal ion and the basicity of the catalyst determined the selectivity [ 19] ; for those catalysts with small metal ions the alkene selectivity fit into the pattern shown in Fig. 12 while those catalysts with larger metal ions where basicity dominated the selectivity fit the pattern shown in Fig. 11. However, the present data show that the size and/or basicity of the leaving group also must have an impact on the alkene selectivity. Thus, for the alcohol both the metal nitride and oxide give the pattern shown in Fig. 12 where the selectivity is proposed to be dominated by ionic size, and thereby the orientation of the coordinatively unsaturated site. However, for 2-octylamine there is a significant shift in selectivity from that observed for the alcohol. 4. Summary The present results make it appear that the loss of ammonia through an elimination reaction (reaction 6) during the hydrodenitrogenation reaction utilizing metal nitride catalysts is not very likely. First, while there is elimination to form an alkene, the reaction is not very rapid at 360 and, more importantly, has the potential to produce higher molecular weight compounds that contain nitrogen. In fact, the formation of the secondary amine is the dominant reaction with most of the metal nitride or oxide catalysts employed in this study. It is realized that the secondary amine formation should be a bimolecular reaction and that elimination of ammonia is a unimolecular reaction following zero order kinetics at higher concentrations, but first order at low concentrations. Even so, it would appear that the elimination of nitrogen through a hydrogenolysis reaction is a more likely reaction pathway than by the elimination of ammonia catalyzed by the support, especially in the case of the metal nitride catalysts. The metal nitride and oxide catalysts of W, Mo, V, and Fe have similar characteristics for the conversion of 2-octylamine. Under the conditions used in this study, many of the catalysts are more selective for the formation of higher molecular weight compounds that contain nitrogen than for the elimination of ammonia to effect the last step of a hydrodenitrogenation reaction.
