DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60122-9 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene over Mesoporous Ni-Based Catalysts LI Jianhui, LI Rengui, WANG Caicai, HUANG Chuanjing*, WENG Weizheng, WAN Huilin# State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, China Abstract: Mesoporous nickel oxide was prepared using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the template and urea as the hydrolysis agent. The method was extended successfully to the synthesis of a mesoporous multicomponent Ni-based catalyst, NiMgO. The mesostructured catalysts were compared with a nanosized NiO catalyst prepared by a sol-gel process. These catalysts were used for oxidative dehydro- genation of ethane to ethylene. The meso-NiO showed higher ethylene selectivity than the nano-NiO at the same ethane conversion. The temperature range for the reaction on meso-NiO was larger, which gave a higher ethylene yield. The catalytic performance of meso-NiO was improved by Mg modification. On meso-NiMgO, a 56.6% ethane conversion with 30.1% ethylene yield was obtained at 450 ÂºC, C2H6:O2:N2 = 1:1:4, and GHSV = 18000 ml/(gÂ·h). This ethylene yield was much higher than the best obtained with nano-NiO (15.9%) or meso-NiO (22.5%). Key words: nickel-based catalyst; mesoporous material; magnesium; ethane; oxidative dehydrogenation; ethyleneÇ‚ Ethylene is an important feedstock in the petrochemical industry. It is currently produced mainly by the steam cracking of naphtha or ethane. The steam cracking, however, is operated at a high temperature, consumes much energy, and has a low selectivity to ethylene and unavoidable coke formation. Therefore, the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethylene has received much attention because it is an exothermic reaction that can be carried out at a low temperature with high conversion and selectivity. Recently, good catalytic performance by Ni-based catalysts have been reported [1â€“5]. Nano-sized NiO showed a better catalytic behavior at a low temperature as compared with a larger NiO catalyst [2]. Na- kamura et al. [5] demonstrated that a high surface area MgO used as the support for NiO can effectively suppress the re- duction of nickel oxide, which greatly improves the catalytic performance. However, the reaction temperature used was quite high (600 ÂºC). In recent years, mesoporous materials have attracted a lot of attention because of their high surface area, narrow pore size distribution, and large pore volume. A mesostructured material constructed using metal oxide nanoparticles as a building block is nanosized and has mesoporous properties, and is expected to show a unique catalytic behavior [6]. Banerjee et al. [7] first synthesized mesoporous NiO using an anionic surfactant as the template and urea as the hydrolyzing agent. Xing et al. [8] prepared nickel oxide by this method and found that its mesoporous structure was due to a nanoparticle assembly. Many studies have been reported for mesostructured NiO that discussed its synthesis, characterization, and applications in electrochemistry [7â€“11]. However, few studies have been done on the use of meso-NiO in catalysis. In this work, mesoporous NiO was prepared by Banerjeeâ€™s method [7], and the method was extended to the synthesis of mesoporous NiMgO. ODE reaction results over these catalysts are reported. The mesoporous NiO was prepared similarly to the literature procedure [7,8]. Typically, NiCl2Â·6H2O, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), urea, and distilled water in a mole ratio of 1:2:30:60 were mixed, stirred at 40 ÂºC, and then transferred to an oven LI Jianhui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(8): 714â€“716 and heated at 80 ÂºC for 20 h. The resulting precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol several times, dried at 60 ÂºC overnight, and calcined at 400 ÂºC with a heating rate of 1 ÂºC/min. For the Mg-modified sample, MgCl2Â·6H2O was added to NiCl2Â·6H2O to give a Ni:Mg = 10:1 molar ratio, which was then mixed with SDS, urea, and dis- tilled water. The other steps were the same as described above. These catalysts were denoted meso-NiO and meso-NiMgO, respectively. For comparison, nanosized NiO, denoted nano- NiO, was prepared by a sol-gel process [2]. Ni(NO3)2Â·6H2O and citric acid were diluted, mixed, dried by heating, and fi- nally calcined at 400 ÂºC in a muffle oven. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on an automated Micromeritics TriStar 3000 apparatus. Temperature- programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed using a TCD detector with a 5% H2/Ar mixture at 20 ml/min. The heating rate was 10 ÂºC/min. The ODE reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. For each test, 0.1 g of catalyst mixed with an equal amount of quartz particles was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor (5 mm i.d.). The feed gas with a molar composition of C2H6:O2:N2 = 1:1:4 had a space velocity of 18000 ml/(gÂ·h). The products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-960) equipped with a Porapak Q column and a 5A molecular sieve column. The N2 adsorption-desorption measurement results are pre- sented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. From Table 1 it can be seen that the surface area of meso-NiO was much larger than that of nano-NiO. Compared to meso-NiO, meso-NiMgO showed decreases in surface area and pore volume and an increase in pore size. The isotherms in Fig. 1 showed hysteresis loops for these two samples, which clearly indicates the presence of a mesoporous structure in both samples. This indicates that the homogeneous precipitation using a surfactant as a struc- ture-directing agent, used to synthesize mesoporous NiO [7,8], can be extended to the synthesis of a multicomponent mesostructured nickel-based catalyst. The H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. Both the nano- and meso-NiO samples showed one reduction peak at 316 and 330 oC, respectively, that can be ascribed to the reduction of Ni2+ to metallic nickel. The peak from meso-NiO was shifted to a higher temperature, which was probably be- cause the oxide nanoparticles were aggregated into a mesoporous structure. In contrast to the pure NiO samples, meso-NiMgO showed two reduction peaks at 330 and 394 oC. The first peak was likely from a small amount of Ni species similar to that in meso-NiO, while the second peak can be ascribed to the reduction of Mg-modified meso-NiO or a (Ni,Mg)O solid solution. The higher temperature peak was larger, indicating that a majority of the Ni species had inter- acted with the Mg species and became less reducible. XRD results for all the samples showed the diffraction peaks of NiO, but no phase with Mg was detected for meso-NiMgO, which indicated that the Mg species was highly dispersed. The results of the ODE reaction over the various catalysts are given in Table 2. On nano-NiO, ethane conversion in- creased rapidly with reaction temperature, and the maximum ethylene yield of 15.9% was obtained at 350 ÂºC. However, when the temperature reached 400 ÂºC, a large amount of methane was produced, which led to a big drop in ethylene selectivity. The XRD results showed that this sample was partially reduced to nickel metal at 400 ÂºC, which can be the reason for the change in catalytic performance. Meso-NiO gave a higher ethylene selectivity at the same ethane conver- sion than nano-NiO.

At 450 ÂºC, the ethylene selectivity was still high (51.5%), and the ethylene yield was 22.5%, which was much higher than the maximum value obtained with nano-NiO. The catalytic per- formance of meso-NiO was further improved by Mg modifi- cation. For meso-NiMgO, although a slightly lower activity was observed at a low temperature, probably due to its smaller surface area and lower reducibility than meso-NiO, the ethyl- ene selectivity, except that at 300 ÂºC, was increased and the maximum ethylene yield obtained at 450 ÂºC was also enhanced by a large amount. The difference in the structure of the meso- and nano-NiO catalysts can be the cause for their different catalytic per- formance. The mesoporous structure had a large surface area and abundant mesopores for efficient molecular transport by diffusion in the channels during the ODE reaction, which suppressed the consecutive oxidation of ethylene to CO and CO2 and increased the selectivity for ethane to ethylene. Among the catalysts studied, meso-NiMgO showed the best catalytic performance for the ODE reaction. This can be at- tributed to the Mg promoter that decreased the surface acidity and facilitated the desorption of ethylene. On the other hand, the H2-TPR and reaction results suggested a relationship be- tween the reactivity of the lattice oxygen and the ODE per- formance of the catalysts. The lattice oxygen of nano-NiO was more active, and it was easier to reduce. Thus, although ethane conversion increased rapidly with temperature, ethylene se- lectivity sharply decreased due to the reduction of NiO. In contrast, the lattice oxygen was less active on the mesostruc- tured samples, especially the Mg-modified catalyst. As a result, the ethane conversions were lower than that of nano-NiO at the same temperature, but the ethylene selectivities were notably enhanced, and a good ODE result was obtained at a higher temperature. Generally, the ODE performance of Ni-based catalysts is affected by many factors, which include the surface oxygen species and Ni valence state and vacancies [3,4,12,13]. These are related to the catalyst structure and preparation [14], and detailed characterization and further studies on these are underway. References 1 Zhang X J, Liu J X, Jing Y, Xie Y Ch.
