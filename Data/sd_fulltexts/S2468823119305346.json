Graphical abstract Mesoporous aluminosilica is a unique structure for catalysis due to Lewis acidity of aluminum. Here, we design a new catalyst by merging periodic mesoporous organosilica with aluminosilica into its structure instead of mere silica. The employed organosilica bridge in this synthesis is a thiourea based organosiloxane precursor which has a unique feature in supporting catalytically active cations. Therefore, we support Cu2+ ions through these thiourea bridges to generate a catalytically active species along with aluminosilica structure (Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU). Combining alminosilica with Cu2+ ions led to a synergistic catalytic activity in the aqueous oxidation of dibenzothiophene. Furthermore, the addition of Al3+ as a precursor during the synthesis of PMO causes an enhancement in the mesoporosity and surface area and led to the formation of mesoporous nanofibers. The proposed green bifunctional catalyst is easily recoverable and reusable for several consecutive cycles. Keywords Mesoporous aluminosilica Periodic mesoporous organosilica Green oxidation Dibenzothiophene Introduction Pioneering researches in hybrid organic-inorganic mesoporous materials late in the nineties led to the discovery of periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials [1,2]. Owing to their unique properties, they rapidly became popular in various fields. In these materials, the organosilica part plays a unique role in engineering the nature and characteristics of the pore walls depending on the application that is supposed to be employed. Therefore, there is a major difference between the post-modified mesopores and PMOs [3–5]. The organic part in PMOs can play as a ligand for supporting metal ions, and furthermore; it can be effective in the growth and stabilization of nanoparticles [6]. These types of PMOs can be widely used in catalysis. Hence, several types of organosiloxane have been developed for catalytic purposes. Imidazolium, phenylene, and vinylene based organic parts have played a major role in the development of PMOs as catalyst [3]. Sometimes, in addition to these ligands, we can further enhance the catalytic performance by adding extra features like acidic centers [7–10]. On the other hand, mesoporous aluminosilicate materials are another promising type of catalyst which is employed in a wide variety of reactions owing to Lewis acidity of Al3+ in aluminosilica network [11,12]. Bearing in mind that merging the potential catalytic activity of mesoporous aluminosilicas and mesoporous organosilicas can provide a unique combinatory material with synergistic features in the catalysis. Herein, for the first time, we employed aluminosilica structure for synthesis of periodic mesoporous organosilica instead of bare silica. We called this new structure, periodic mesoporous organo-aluminosilica material (Al/Si-PMO), and employed this new atomic and molecular assembly for supporting Cu2+ ions to fabricate a new catalyst. Therefore, this approach encourages designing a PMO based on the combination and convergence of several catalytically active functions. We employed it in the oxidization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) under aqueous conditions and room temperature. DBT is a naturally occurring tricyclic heterocyclic compound found in petroleum industry as an impurity in crude oil [13,14]. Besides the fact that DBT is a contaminant in oil processing, it is highly toxic organic compound to organisms, environment, and aquatic life through its long-term effects, it is assumed as a contaminant to nature and its removal and degradation is a necessary action in the petrochemical processes [15,16]. As a result, the oxidation of DBT is a major challenge in the industry, and so far, many research themes have been proposed for the oxidation of this organic contaminant [17–19]. The main effort in this area is to propose a green and recyclable catalyst with high performance and sustainable efficiency [20–25]. Among them, modified mesoporous materials carrying transition metals or acidity play an important role in oxidation processes [26,27]. Here, we have carefully examined the oxidation possibility of DBT through our proposed catalyst at room temperature under aqueous conditions in relatively high yield. We also showed that this material acts as a bifunctional synergic catalyst in which the catalytic activity of mesoporous aluminosilica is boosted by embedding the Cu2+ ions to the system. This part is playing as a cooperative role in the catalyst’s performance (Scheme 1 ). Experimental section Materials and methods All starting materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck companies. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were performed applying a Hitachi S-8000 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). TEM (Transmission electron microscope) and TEM-elemental mapping images were performed using a JEM-2100 F with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) spectrums were obtained by a Shimadzu IR-460 spectrometer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a Netzsch-TG 209 F1. BET, BJH, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were run by a Quantachrome BELSORP Mini Autosorb at 77 K. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was employed to show the amount of supported Cu2+. 13C and 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL Delta 75 and 300 MHz spectrometers, respectively. Low-angle XRD analysis was performed using a Rigaku NANO-Viewer (Cu Kα). Synthesis of Cu@Al/Si-TU-PMO Synthesis of BTEPT was achieved according to our previously reported method [28]. Accordingly, 2 mmol of BTEPT starting from the reaction of CS2 and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) (molar ratio is 1:2, respectively) was obtained and immediately used for the next step. In the next step, a triblock copolymer P123, as a structure-directing agent, (2 g) was dissolved in HCl(aq) (2 M, 75 mL), and then, the solution mixture was heated up to 40 °C and was kept at the same temperature for 4 h. Afterward, 0.63 g Al2(SO4)3.16H2O (1 mmol) was added to the mixture and stirred for a few minutes. Furthermore, as-synthesized BTEPT from previous step was mixed with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) with molar ratio of 1:8, respectively, and added dropwise to the solution and continued to stir for 24 h at 40 °C. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was transferred to a polypropylene bottle and kept at 100 °C in an oven for 20 h. Then, a pale yellow solid was obtained by centrifugation and washing with distilled water (20 mL). To extract the template, the obtained solid was then transferred to a Soxhelt kept at reflux conditions within 3 days with methanol. The final product from this step was named Al/Si-PMO-TU. In the final step, CuCl2.2H2O (0.1 g, 0.74 mmol) after dissolving in distilled water (5 mL) was added to the dispersion of Al/Si-PMO-TU (0.1 g) in EtOH (20 mL) and allowed to stir for 12 h at room temperature. Finally, the obtained solid was washed with EtOH (30 mL) and centrifuged and repeated for 3 times to wash loosely bonded copper ions from the surface. The obtained solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 60 °C. according to AAS, the supported amount of Cu2+ on the surface was 0.9 wt% and according to ICP-MS analysis of Al/Si-PMO-TU, the doped content of Al in the material was 1.1 wt%. Ultimately, the obtained solid from this step was named Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU. Catalytic test procedure In a general method, DBT (1 mmol) was added to the dispersion of Cu@Al/Si-PMO (50 mg) in H2O (0.6 mL) and then, H2O2 (1.5 mmol, 30 wt%) was added to the dispersion and allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was separated from the mixture and analysed by GC and GC-mass. The solid obtained from centrifugation was then washed with EtOH (5 mL) and centrifuged three times and reused for the next cycles to study the recyclability of the catalyst. Calculation settings Density functional calculations were performed based on augmented plane wave pseudopotentials [29] with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [30,31] as implemented in the VASP code [32]. For the electronic setting, a fine Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid with a spacing of 0.05 Å−1 and a 500 eV cut-off energy was used. Full geometry optimization was then carried out on the equilibrated structure, with convergence criteria for the energy and forces of 10−6 eV and 10−2 eV/Å, respectively. Further details and the justification of these settings can be found elsewhere in the literature [33,34]. Result and discussion Synthesis and characterization of the Cu@Al/Si-PMO In the present project, we first decided to insert the aluminium ion to the structure of thiourea based PMO to see its effect on the nanoarchitecture of this PMO. Then, we used the aluminosilica structure to improve the catalytic activity as aluminosilica on its own is catalytic. We then tried to apply a synergistic catalytic feature by supporting a further catalytically active transition metal ion. Given the fact that copper ions can have good coordination with thiourea based ligands [35], we further grafted Cu2+ species to the surface of Al/Si-PMO-TU through thiourea bridges. To see the efficiency of our proposed catalyst, we used Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU in the catalytic oxidation of dibenzothiophene under aqueous conditions. Scheme 1 shows a brief synthesis procedure of Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU. Based on our observations, the obtained morphology after adding the Al3+ ions was nanofiber-like (∼100 nm) based on TEM and SEM images, which shows that Al3+ ions have affected the final structure of target PMO. However, the pore diameter of Al/Si-PMO-TU was identical to the aluminium-less type PMO. Furthermore, according to SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2a–d), supporting the copper (II) ions did not have a major effect either on the structure or the morphology of the Al/Si-PMO-TU. On the other hand, inserting Al3+ into the structure of the PMO led to enhancement of the microporosity and surface area compared to Al3+-free version of thiourea based PMO [28]. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm patterns obtained from Al/Si-PMO-TU shows an ordered mesoporous structure (type IV) for both Al/Si-PMO-TU and Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU with higher surface area compared to pure SBA-15 and aluminium-less type PMO-TU (Fig. 1a ) [28,34,36]. This enhancement in the surface area can be due to the insertion of aluminium ions into the structure of the PMO. The surface area of Al/Si-PMO-TU was ca. 1030 m2. g−1. After copper supporting, the surface area was still high, with a small decrease. This mesoporous organosilica also indicates significant some microporosity as well. Decreasing the microporosity also shows that the copper ions have occupied a part of the micropores. BJH plots showed that the Al/Si-PMO has an average pore size of 6.3 nm, and Cu@Al/Si-PMO has an average pore size of 6.4 nm (Fig. 1b). The porosity study of the PMO’s was also studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, as shown in Fig. 1d. A peak at 2θ = 0.90 for Al/Si-PMO-TU can be indicative of a mesoporous structure with d value of 9.8 nm. Furthermore, after grafting Cu2+, the related peak with a slight shift in the position to 2θ = 0.88 (d =10 nm) with a small decrease in the intensity which shows that the mesoporosity has majorly retained. The ratio of the organic moiety of Al/Si-PMO-TU to aluminosilica was determined by TGA. The weight loss of Al/Si-PMO-TU was ca. 22.1 wt%, which can be attributed to the organic motif of the PMO, dialkylthiourea. However, a small decrease in the weight loss of Cu(II) supported PMO (17.1 wt%) can be due to the presence of Cu(II) ions (Fig. 1c). FTIR spectrums of in comparison to Al/Si-PMO-TU and Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU parallel peaks (Fig. 3 ) for each of them are strong evidence that the framework of (triethoxysilyl)propyl)thiourea (BTEPT) was highly conserved in the course of synthesis. A peak at 1551 cm−1 indicated CS bond stretching in thiourea. NH stretching revealed itself as a broad peak at 3250 cm−1, and two close peaks around 1100 cm−1 comply with SiOSi bonds. Solid state 29Si-NMR spectrum of Al/Si-PMO-TU was obtained for further examination of the structure and chemical composition (Fig. 4 ). We confirmed the successful loading of organosilica synthesis by the presence of T peaks in the 29Si-NMR spectrum. We also could confirm that all organosilica components were well co-assembled with silica (originated from hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS) by the exclusive appearance of T3 peak. This T3 peak shows that all organosilicon atoms are fully connected other OSi groups. The ratio of Q2, Q3, and Q4 peaks shows that surface silanols are predominantly originating from silica source (not organosilica). Furthermore, the ratio of T to Q indicates that molar ratio of silica to organosilica is 22.7:77.3, respectively. Based on the 29Si-NMR and the ICP results of Al/Si-PMO-TU, the chemical formula of Al/Si-PMO-TU, can be ascribed as Si1.23Al0.46O2.46C1.36H3.88N0.45S0.23. Theoretical study of Al/Si-PMO To investigate the acidic and reactivity of the aluminosilica through examining its electronic structure, we constructed a simple representative model for DFT calculations. The model presented in Fig. 5 a, comprised of 22 atomic layers of α-SiO2 structure cleaved at [001] direction, which is the most stable facet [37]. The lateral dimension of this structure was made out of 1u×3v supercell. Then two Al ions were substituted for Si. To maintain the charge balance, an oxygen vacancy was created to account for the holes created by 2 Al3+ being substituted for two Si4+. After geometry optimisation, we found the AlO bonds at the surface were 1.72 Å slightly longer than the Si–O which were 1.68 Å which accounts for Al3+ larger ionic radius. The fully optimised structure in POSCAR format is presented in the ESI. The first hint for intrinsic acidity at a surface can be spotted from the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of different ions at the surface [38]. By close inspection of Fig. 5b, we realise that the electrostatic potential near the surface Al ions is −48.0 eV which is 25.9 eV higher than that of Si being at −73.9 eV. Detailed visualisation is provided in Fig. S2. Furthermore, the partial density of state of the surface Al and Si ions, shown in Fig. 5c, demonstrates that the surface Al has easily accessible states right above the Fermi level, while Si’s empty states are further away from the Fermi level at ∼1.6 eV. This electronic structure indicates that when a nucleophilic molecule interacts with this surface, Al’s empty states will accept the electrons at minimum energy penalty associated with shifting the Fermi level. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, drawn for the energy range of −1 < E < 0 in Fig. 5d, show these empty orbitals are localised right above surface Al ion further cementing the notion of Al being electrophilic or Lewis acid centres in aluminosilica. Fig. 5d also shows the absence of any such available orbitals at Si centres establishing that the anticipated acidity originates exclusively from Al centres. The iso-surface of the electronic localisation function (η), which is a topological measure of the probability of finding an electron at a particular point [39], presented in Fig. 5f, shows that there is a large probability of finding the surface Si’s electron above the surface. However, η above Al is zero. As a result, the availability of empty orbitals at accessible energy range (LUMO) and lack of electron localisation above the surface (η = 0) combined with more positive electrostatic potential at surface Al atoms render these centres electrophilic with Lewis acid functionality. Catalytic properties of Cu@Al/Si-PMO system Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the Cu@Al-PMO-TU was tested by employing it in the deep oxidation of the DBT to dibenzothiophene dioxide (DBT-O2) via dibenzothiophene oxide (DBT-O) as an intermediate (Scheme 2 ). This chemical compound is usually oxidized by a transitional metal catalyst in the presence of an oxidant [40]. Here, we employed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as green and echo-friendly oxidant and tested it under the aqueous condition at room temperature for 2 h. Afterward, the reaction showed complete conversion towards its corresponding sulfone oxidation product while no significant sulfoxide left to be observed under the mentioned conditions. We also tested the catalytic activity of Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU under aerobic conditions and found that the catalytic activity was minor. We tried to find out the catalytic roles of aluminosilica and copper on DBT oxidation by testing the different catalysts under the identical conditions. Therefore, CuCl2, Al/Si-PMO-TU, and Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU were separately tested in the reaction (Fig. 6 ). Based on this comparison, we found that CuCl2 and Al/Si-PMO-TU does not have significant catalytic activities, but the Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU. These tests showed that copper-thiourea complex with aluminosilica structure generates a synergistic catalytic capability as sole PMO-TU and sole Al-SBA-15 do not have this level of catalytic activity. On the other hand, testing Cu@PMO-TU in the oxidation reaction and comparing it with previous catalysts shows that copper (II) ions in the complex formed with thiourea are more active than its salt form and aluminosilica form. This shows that the major role of catalysis is owing to aluminosilica structure. Moreover, it shows that copper is more active when it accompanies aluminosilica. We studied the kinetics of Al/Si-PMO-TU and Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU in the aqueous oxidation of DBT. This study showed that the Cu contained PMO has higher activity from the early minutes of the reaction starts. Finally, this catalyst was recovered after the catalytic oxidation and reused for several runs, which showed very small decreases in each catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the catalyst was separated from the solution in the primary moments of the reaction, and the supernatant was analysed by AAS to measure the amount of leached copper ions. However, no detectable copper ion was found in the reaction solution. This also shows that the reaction had occurred on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 7 a). Moreover, studying the activity of the catalyst in the early moments of the reaction start shows the recyclability of the catalyst (Fig. 7b). In this regard, Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU was reused in six consecutive cycles, and the results of each cycle in the first 30 min of the reaction prove that the catalyst is sustainable and stable in the reaction media. In the final step, we compared the catalytic parameters of DBT oxidation under different conditions, which are previously published, with the reaction conditions of our proposed catalyst (Cu@Al/Si-PMO) and showed them in Table 1 . This comparison shows that our catalyst is more active and greener than all other cases pointed out in the plot. Conclusions In conclusion, a new catalyst was obtained by merging the thiourea-based PMO with aluminosilica structure, and then, the catalytic feature was synergised by supporting copper(II) ions onto the internal pore surface of the Al/Si-PMO-TU. Aluminosilica structure was found to be an active agent that causes a synergistic effect in the catalytic activity in deep oxidation of DBT to DBT-O2. It was also found that thiourea based organosilioxane plays a critical role both in boosting the catalytic activity and its supporting capability onto the surface and preserving its leaching from the surface.

        "dc:description": "Mesoporous aluminosilica is a unique structure for catalysis due to Lewis acidity of aluminum. Here, we design a new catalyst by merging periodic mesoporous organosilica with aluminosilica into its structure instead of mere silica. The employed organosilica bridge in this synthesis is a thiourea based organosiloxane precursor which has a unique feature in supporting catalytically active cations. Therefore, we support Cu2+ ions through these thiourea bridges to generate a catalytically active species along with aluminosilica structure (Cu@Al/Si-PMO-TU). Combining alminosilica with Cu2+ ions led to a synergistic catalytic activity in the aqueous oxidation of dibenzothiophene. Furthermore, the addition of Al3+ as a precursor during the synthesis of PMO causes an enhancement in the mesoporosity and surface area and led to the formation of mesoporous nanofibers. The proposed green bifunctional catalyst is easily recoverable and reusable for several consecutive cycles.",
