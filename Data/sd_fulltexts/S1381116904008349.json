Graphical abstract The results of TPR and 18O-isotope exchange experiments of Pd/TiO2-ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate that the excellent activity of Pd/TiZr2 is due to its high oxygen mobility and moderate reducibility. TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide supported palladium catalysts were prepared and evaluated for the catalytic combustion of methane at low temperature. Although XRD patterns of TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxides show individual anatase TiO2 and monoclinic ZrO2 peaks without shift, the combination of TiO2 and ZrO2 obviously favors the catalytic performance. Catalyst Pd/TiZr2 has activity much higher than Pd/TiO2, even higher than Pd/ZrO2, which is one of the most active catalysts for methane combustion. The results of TPR and 18O-isotope exchange experiments demonstrate that the excellent activity of Pd/TiZr2 is due to its high oxygen mobility and moderate reducibility, which is in accordance with our previous work. XPS results indicate that the dispersion of Pd has little influence on the catalytic activity. Keywords Methane combustion Palladium TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide Reducibility Oxygen mobility 1 Introduction Catalytic total oxidation of methane is an effective way to use methane as an environment-friendly fuel [1–4]. Among the catalysts investigated, supported palladium showed the highest activity for this reaction [5,6], especially ZrO2-supported catalysts [7–14]. Great efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the reaction mechanism and the metal–support interaction in order to get a deep understanding of the reason for high activity [7–21]. It is generally accepted that the catalytic performance is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, but the key factors influencing the catalytic activity are still in debate. Ciuparu et al. [17–20] found that the support contributed significantly to the oxygen pool of the PdO phase available for the methane combustion and the stabilizing effect of the support for PdO may be related to the oxygen transfer from the support to the PdO particles. Our recent work [22] on Pd/TiO2/Al2O3 system proved that the reducibility and oxygen mobility of PdO were two factors directly related to the overall catalytic activity of palladium catalysts. A moderate reducibility and high oxygen mobility will lead to high methane combustion activity. In order to increase the activity of supported palladium catalyst, various kinds of modified ZrO2 have been investigated as supports [23–27]. However, among these catalysts ZrO2 was mostly used as additives, and to our knowledge no palladium catalysts supported on modified ZrO2 have been reported to be superior to Pd/ZrO2 until now. On the other hand, titania modification of KIT-1 mesoporous materials [28] or alumina [22,29] supports could improve the methane combustion activity of palladium. Kang et al. [28] reported that titania chemically bonded with the skeleton of mesoporous materials interacted with the co-loaded palladium and suppressed the decomposition of palladium oxide, which was the more active phase in the methane combustion compared to palladium, and consequently leaded to the improvement of the catalytic performance. Our previous work [22] showed that the addition of titania into alumina enhanced the reduction as well as the oxygen mobility of palladium oxide, hence generated the catalysts with higher activity for low temperature catalytic combustion of methane. In the present paper, palladium catalysts with titania–zirconia complex oxides as supports were prepared and tested for catalytic total oxidation of methane at low temperature. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed 18O-isotope exchange techniques were employed to investigate the reducibility and oxygen mobility. The results show that Pd/TiZr2 have a moderate reducibility and higher oxygen exchange activity compared to other catalysts, which make it one of the most active catalysts for methane total oxidation at low temperature. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxide was prepared by coprecipitation method. Ti(C4H9O)4 and C2H5OH were mixed with volume ratio of 1:4. Then the mixture solution and Zr(NO3)4 solution were dropped simultaneously into 5molL−1 NH3·H2O at room temperature. Afterwards, the precipitate was then vacuum filtered and dried at 120°C followed by calcinations at 500°C in air for 8h. Catalysts of 2wt.% Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 were prepared by impregnation method using palladium nitrate as precursor. The catalysts were dried at 120°C overnight and calcined in air at 500°C for 4h. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests Activity evaluation was carried out in a U-shaped fixed-bed microreactor (i.d.=10mm) with a continuous flow at atmospheric pressure. The catalysts were pressed to pellets, and then crushed and sieved to 40–60mesh. The catalyst (120mg) was put in the microreactor and pretreated in flowing air at 500°C for 1h then cooled down to room temperature before the catalytic test. A K-type thermocouple was fixed to the middle of the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature and to control the furnace temperature. The feed gas was 1% CH4 in air. The total feed flow rate was 66mLmin−1, corresponding to a gas hourly mass velocity (GHMV) of 33,000mLh−1 g−1. The reactants and products were analyzed with an on-line SQ-206 gas chromatogram equipped with hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID). A methanator of nickel catalyst was used to convert CO2 and CO to CH4 for FID analysis. A four-meter long Porapak Q column was employed to separate CH4, CO and CO2. The peaks of CH4, CO and CO2 were collected with a computer and the conversion of methane was calculated automatically. Methane conversion was measured from 275 to 500°C at an interval of 25°C. Each reaction temperature was kept stable for 30min before analyzing the effluent gas. The temperatures corresponding to 10, 50, and 90% methane conversion, T 10%, T 50%, and T 90%, were obtained from the temperature dependent plot of methane conversion. 2.3 Characterization techniques Surface area was determined by using BET method based on N2 adsorption with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 Analyzer. The samples were degassed in vacuum (10−3 Pa) for 2h at 300°C prior to adsorption measurements. Phase composition of the catalysts was determined with a Rigaku D/MAX-200 X-ray powder diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40kV and 100mA. Surface composition of the samples was measured by using a Kratos Axis Ultra System with monochromatic Al Kα X-rays (1486.71eV) operated at 15kV and 15mA (emission current) in a chamber pressure of approximately 10−8 Pa. Energy step 1 and 160eV pass energy were used for survey scan; energy step 0.1 and 20eV pass energy were used for element scan. The reducibility of the catalysts was measured with fixed-bed reactor. About 16mg of 40–60mesh catalyst was put in a U-shape reactor and kept at −15°C for some time, then a gas stream of 5% H2 in Ar was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 30mLmin−1. H2-TPR profile was recorded when the temperature was raised from −10 to 50°C at a constant rate of 2°Cmin−1. The rate of hydrogen consumption during the reduction was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Oxygen mobility of the catalysts was investigated using a temperature-programmed 18O-isotope exchange method [22,30]. The measurements were carried out in a quartz reactor with an on-line-coupled quadruple mass spectrometer QMG421 I (Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH). For each test, about 300mg of catalyst was introduced into the reactor and pretreated at 450°C for 4.5h in air. After cooling down to 100°C, a gas mixture of Ar, 16O2, and 18O2 with a pressure ratio of 4:1:1 and a total pressure of 100Pa were introduced into the reaction system. All measurements were performed in the temperature range 100–700°C with a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1. Between the gas phase 16O2 and 18O2 and the catalyst, several processes such as oxygen uptake/release, homogeneous gas phase 18O-isotope exchange, partial heterogeneous 18O-isotope exchange and complete heterogeneous 18O-isotope exchange may take place separately or simultaneously depending on the nature of the compound and/or the temperature range investigated. The temperature dependence of the ionic currents (IC) of 16O2, 18O2, and 16O18O provide the information about the isotope exchange reaction. In order to differentiate between simultaneous processes, four different coefficients, s, c, y and v , are derived from the measured ionic currents [31–33]. s represents the oxygen partial pressure of the gas phase standardized by the oxygen partial pressure at the beginning of the measurement. It changes only when oxygen uptake/release occurs. c expresses the proportion of 18O relative to the total oxygen content in the gas phase. It decreases when oxygen is released, and partial or complete heterogeneous exchange processes take place. y describes the deviation of the actual partial pressure from the equilibrium partial pressure of the mixed isotope 16O18O. A decrease in y shows the occurrence of the partial heterogeneous or homogeneous 18O isotope exchange, while an increase in y indicates the release of 16O2. v represents the fraction of 18O in the gas phase that originates from the 16O18O molecules. It increases when any of the three types of 18O isotope exchange processes takes place. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Activity evaluation The results of the catalytic tests for catalysts Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 are shown in Table 1 . Pd/TiO2 has the lowest activity. The addition of ZrO2 enhances the catalytic activity for methane combustion; all Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 show higher activities than Pd/TiO2. When atomic ratio of Zr:Ti is lower than 2:3, the activities of catalysts increase with the increasing content of ZrO2, among which T 90% of the best catalyst Pd/TiZr2 is lower than that of Pd/TiO2 more than 80°C, even lower than that of Pd/ZrO2, which is one of the most active catalysts for methane combustion. But when Zr:Ti>2:3, the activities of Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 decrease, coming close to that of Pd/ZrO2. In order to understand the behavior of different catalysts, XRD, XPS, TPR and 18O-isotope exchange techniques were used to characterize selected catalysts. 3.2 XRD and XPS measurement XRD was employed to identify the bulk phase compositions of all the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1 , Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2 display intensive and sharp peaks characteristic of anatase TiO2 and monoclinic ZrO2, respectively. XRD patterns of all the Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 catalysts have both the peaks of anatase TiO2 and monoclinic ZrO2 without any shift of peak positions, indicating that there is no interaction between TiO2 and ZrO2. The peak of PdO (2θ =33.6°) with the highest intensity is located at the same position with the peak of ZrO2, so the characteristic peaks of PdO cannot be found in the XRD patterns of catalysts containing ZrO2. From the XRD pattern of Pd/TiO2, it can be seen that palladium exists in the state of PdO. The specific surface area and surface atom ratio of all catalysts are listed in Table 1. As is well known, surface atom ratio is closely related to the dispersion. The greater the surface atom ratio, the higher the dispersion. In the literatures, there are some confused reports about the relationship of the palladium dispersion and the activity of catalyst. Fujimoto et al. [8] and Muller et al. [36] reported a higher activity of larger PdO particles, but Widjaja et al. [37,38] demonstrated that the excellent activity of Pd/Al2O3–36NiO was due to the improved dispersion of PdO. Different from these opinions, our previous paper [22] suggested that the dispersion of palladium had little effect on the activity. The results herein approve the conclusion. For example, Pd/ZrO2 has the highest surface ratio of Pd, but its activity is not the best; while the activity of Pd/TiZr1 is close to Pd/ZrO2, but the surface Pd ratios of the two samples differ greatly. Therefore, it seems that the dispersion of palladium is not the decisive factor of the activity, which means the characters of supports and the metal–support interaction must be taken into account in this reaction. 3.3 H2-TPR measurements The reducibility of supported palladium oxide is an important factor influencing its catalytic performance [22]. Temperature-programmed reduction technique was used to study the reducibility of catalysts. The TPR profiles of catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 . For all samples investigated, there is a large peak below 30°C corresponding to the reduction of PdO. To be noted, the supports themselves show no reduction peak in this temperature range. The reduction temperatures of the Pd/TiO2–ZrO2 catalysts are ranged from 5°C of Pd/TiO2 to 17°C of Pd/ZrO2, and the PdO reduction peaks shift to the lower temperature side with the increasing content of titania. 3.4 Temperature-programmed 18O-isotope exchange Oxygen isotope exchange is a common method to study the uptake/release properties of oxygen and the participation of oxygen from the catalyst in oxidation reactions [22,30–35]. Temperature-programmed 18O-isotope exchange measurements were carried out to investigate the oxygen mobility of selected catalysts. The samples selected are Pd/TiZr2 with the highest activity for methane combustion; Pd/TiZr3 and Pd supported on the single oxide Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2. The results of 18O-isotope exchange and the temperature dependence of the four coefficients of Pd/TiZr2 are presented in Fig. 3 . When the temperature is below 405°C, all the ionic currents of 16O2, 18O2, and 16O18O as well as the four coefficients are constant. At above 405°C, 18O2 begins to decrease and continues up to 700°C. At the same time, the 16O2 and the coefficients, s and v , increase with temperature from 405 to 700°C, while the coefficient c decreases. But the rates of increase or decrease are different dependent on the temperature range. The y coefficient first decreases with reaction temperature demonstrating partial heterogeneous isotope exchange and reaches a minimum at 517°C, and then it increases. When the temperature exceeds 606°C, oxygen releases at a much higher rate, indicating the bulk decomposition of palladium oxide. According to the variation of the ionic currents and the coefficients, the reaction process can be divided into three regions. The first region, between 405 and 517°C, a decrease in 18O2 ionic current is accompanied by increasing 16O18O and 16O2 ionic currents. The coefficients v and s increase, while coefficients c and y decrease. From these results, it can be deduced that both partial heterogeneous isotope exchange (PHE) and oxygen release take place in this temperature range, PHE predominating over the oxygen release. In the second region 517–606°C, 18O2 and 16O2 remain decreasing and increasing, respectively, while 16O18O turns to go down after reaching a maximum. The corresponding coefficients, s, v , and c, show variations similar to those in the first region, but y changes to increase. Complete heterogeneous isotope exchange (CHE), desorption and partial heterogeneous isotope exchange (PHE) take place in this temperature range, with CHE and desorption predominating over PHE. In the third region, between 606 and 700°C, 18O2 continues to decrease with a rapid increase in 16O2, and 16O18O also increases. The coefficients v and s also increase at a much higher rate than in the first and second regions. The decrease in coefficient c slows down, and the coefficient y increases slowly. Therefore, PHE and oxygen release as predominant process take place at an increased rate in this temperature range, CHE occurs simultaneously. Similarly, the four coefficients of other samples can be obtained from the ionic currents of 16O2, 18O2, and 16O18O (Figs. 4–6 ). Compared with Pd/TiZr2, they show more or less the same behavior in isotope exchange reaction, except for different temperature regions. The processes taking place on each sample during temperature programmed 18O-isotope exchange measurements are summarized in Table 2 . Pd/TiZr2 displays the lowest onset temperature for 18O-isotope exchange, indicating the highest oxygen mobility. The oxygen mobility of Pd/TiO2 is the lowest, while Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiZr3 have moderate oxygen mobility. Our previous paper proved that the reducibility and oxygen-exchange activity of PdO were two factors directly related to the overall catalytic activity of palladium catalysts. A moderate reducibility and high oxygen mobility will lead to high methane conversion activity. The reducibility of Pd/TiZr2 is between that of Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, but its oxygen mobility is much higher. Therefore, Pd/TiZr2 shows excellent catalytic activity for methane combustion at low temperature. Although Pd/ZrO2 shows higher oxygen mobility than Pd/TiZr3, its lowest reducibility is an unfavorable factor in catalytic methane combustion. Therefore, Pd/ZrO2 and Pd/TiZr3 have close catalytic activity for methane combustion. Pd/TiO2 has highest reducibility and lowest oxygen mobility, both of which are harmful to methane combustion and lead to its lowest activity for methane combustion. 4 Conclusions Catalysts of Pd supported on TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxides show very high activity for methane total oxidation at low temperature. Among them, Pd/TiZr2 with the highest activity shows a T 90% of 405°C at a gas hourly mass velocity (GHMV) of 33,000mLh−1 g−1. It is about 80°C lower than that of Pd/TiO2, and even lower than that of Pd/ZrO2 which is one of the catalysts with highest activity for methane total oxidation at low temperature. The 18O-isotope exchange measurements demonstrated that both partial and complete heterogeneous exchanges, as well as oxygen release, were observed for the selected catalysts. Compared with Pd/TiO2 and Pd/ZrO2, Pd/TiZr2 has higher activity for oxygen exchange reaction and lower temperature for bulk palladium oxide decomposition. The excellent activity of Pd/TiZr2 is due to its high oxygen mobility and moderate reducibility. XPS results indicate that the dispersion of Pd has little influence on the catalytic activity.
