DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60098-4 Steam Reforming of Dimethyl Ether over Coupled ZSM-5 and Cu-Zn-Based Catalysts FENG Dongmei, ZUO Yizan, WANG Dezheng, WANG Jinfu* Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Reaction Engineering and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China Abstract: Dimethyl ether (DME) steam reforming (SR) is one possible source of hydrogen for fuel cells. The synergistic effect of catalyst coupling for the DME SR process and the coupling of reaction-heat transfer was studied. A DME hydrolysis catalyst comprising ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) and a series of methanol steam reforming catalysts (a series of Cu-Zn-based catalysts and a commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst) were used for DME SR. The evaluation of catalytic activity was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and N 2 adsorption. The activity and selectivity were influenced by the catalyst composition and copper content, and also the content of Al and Zr. A Cu:Zn molar ratio of 60:30 together with Al and Zr gave the best dispersion of Cu crystals and the highest low-temperature catalytic activity, with a DME conversion of 72% at 260 °C and a space velocity of 4 922 ml/(g·h). Key words: dimethyl ether; steam reforming; hydrogen production; acid catalyst; copper catalyst Fuel cells are clean and highly efficient power generators for stationary and mobile use [1–3], and the interest in hydrogen production for fuel cell applications is steadily increasing. When hydrogen is used as an energy source, it produces no CO, CO 2 or SO 2 , nor NO x . A hydrogen fuel processor can be ad- vantageous because of its energy efficiency and can lower greenhouse gas emission compared to the direct combustion of hydrocarbons. However, the direct use of hydrogen for fuel cell applications is hindered by problems of storage, safety, refu- eling, etc. As an alternative, there are several economical ways for on-board hydrogen generation from hydrocarbon sources such as gasoline, natural gas, and methanol. Each of these raw materials has both advantages and drawbacks. Although the infrastructure is well established for gasoline and natural gas, their reforming temperatures are high (> 800 °C for gasoline and > 600 °C for natural gas), which require stable catalysts, refractory reactors, and much energy. Methanol steam re- forming (SR) is easy and requires only low temperatures (150– 300 °C), but the cost of methanol as an energy source is rela- tively high; moreover it is biologically toxic in nature. Recently, dimethyl ether (DME) catalytic SR to produce hydrogen has sparked considerable interest in the use of DME as a storable form of hydrogen. The synthesis of DME from syngas has been reported by many researchers [4–9], and DME synthesis can be more economical than methanol synthesis [10] because DME is now used as an aerosol propellant for spray cans to substitute chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy the ozone layer, and it can be an alternative fuel for diesel engines. In particular, DME derived from regenerable resources, e.g. biomass, will help contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. DME is relatively inert and has near-zero smoke and less engine noise compared with traditional diesel fuels. The physical properties of DME are similar to those of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) such that it can be handled and trans- ported through the same LPG devices. DME as a hydrogen source is sulfur-free and activated at relatively low tempera- tures (under 300 °C). A low-temperature operation reduces heat loss and insulation, thus improving the power density of the entire system. These make DME SR a promising source of hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles. An integrated system of DME SR to produce hydrogen usually includes three reactions in the reactor, DME hydrolysis (reaction 1), methanol SR (reaction 2), and water gas shift (reaction 3) as follows: FENG Dongmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(3): 223–229 CH 3 OCH 3 + H 2 O = 2CH 3 OH �H r 0 = +36.6 kJ/mol (1) CH 3 OH + H 2 O = CO 2 + 3H 2 �H r 0 = +49.1 kJ/mol (2) CO + H 2 O = CO 2 + H 2 �H r 0 = –41.17 kJ/mol (3) Overall DME SR can be represented as: CH 3 OCH 3 + 3H 2 O = 2CO 2 + 6H 2 �H r 0 = +135.0 kJ/mol (4) It is generally known that DME hydrolysis takes place on an acid catalyst and MeOH SR proceeds on metal catalysts, e.g. Cu- and Pt-based catalysts. The hydrolysis of DME is limited by a low equilibrium value (the equilibrium conversion of DME at 200 °C is 15%), and a high DME conversion cannot be attained by only the hydrolysis of DME. However, the equi- librium conversion of methanol, reaction (2), at these tem- peratures is high. Therefore, when methanol from DME hy- drolysis is rapidly eliminated by reaction (2), reaction (4) is accelerated and a high conversion of DME (reaction (3)) can be obtained. As discussed in the paper, in addition to the acid amount, the catalyst type, acid type, and acid strength play important roles in the hydrolysis and SR activity [11–16]. Recently, the major differences in DME SR research are in the method of catalyst preparation with attention given to the use of a zeolite or alumina in the catalyst studies [17–24]. The thermodynamics of DME SR processes has also been pub- lished [25,26]. A DME SR was performed in a membrane reactor using a stainless steel-supported Knudsen membrane or -alumina-silica steel composite membrane reactor combined with a water-gas shift reaction to achieve three important aims simultaneously, such as DME conversion improvement, high hydrogen recovery, and CO elimination [27,28]. The solid acid catalysts used for methanol dehydration to DME can also be used for the hydrolysis of DME to methanol because it is the reverse reaction. ZSM-5 zeolite has a larger number of Brønsted acid sites and is an excellent catalyst for DME hydrolysis that can be used at a lower temperature (below 300 °C). Thus, the acid catalyst used in this study was ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 25. Cu-based catalysts, such as the traditional Cu-Zn-Al methanol synthesis catalyst, are known to be active for hy- drogen production by methanol SR. There are few reports on catalyst morphology control, which is also an important aspect for a high performance catalyst. Recently, we found that the catalyst performance can be enhanced by the control of the catalyst structure [29,30]. For example, by using a well con- trolled co-precipitation procedure, a Cu-Zn-Al catalyst with a fibrous structure with high activity and thermal stability for both CO and CO 2 hydrogenation was developed [31]. In this paper, we report on the use of these Cu-Zn-based catalysts prepared by the novel co-precipitation method in DME SR. DME SR was performed over physical mixtures of Cu-Zn-based catalysts + ZSM-5 catalyst and commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst + ZSM-5 catalyst. The synergistic effect in the DME SR process of the coupling of reaction-reaction and reaction-heat transfer was studied. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The ZSM-5 catalyst was purchased from the Catalyst Plant of Nankai University, China. The commercial Cu-Zn-Al cata- lyst (denoted Cu-Zn-Al(c)) was purchased from Nanjing Chemical Industry Company, China. The Cu-Zn-based cata- lysts (Cu-Zn, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Zn-Zr, and Cu-Zn-Al-Zr) were prepared by a novel co-precipitation procedure [29,30]. The Cu-Zn-based catalysts were prepared using the corresponding nitrates as the metal sources and sodium carbonate as the pre- cipitant. The corresponding nitrate and sodium carbonate so- lutions were 1 mol/ml. The precipitate was prepared at a pH value of about 7, washed, dried overnight at 100 °C, and cal- cined at 350 °C for 4 h to yield Cu-Zn-based catalysts. The bifunctional catalysts with the solid acid ZSM-5 active for the conversion of DME to methanol by hydrolysis and the Cu-Zn-based catalysts active for methanol SR were prepared by co-precipitation. The mixture ratio of ZSM-5 and Cu-Zn- based catalysts was fixed at one-to-one by weight. Five physical mixtures of Cu-Zn/ZSM-5, Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5, Cu- Zn-Zr/ZSM-5, Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5, and Cu-Zn-Al(c)/ZSM-5 were obtained. The prepared catalyst of 1 g was ground into a fine powder (60–80 mesh), mixed with 2 g of inert quartz, and placed in the reactor as a fixed bed. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and N 2 adsorption. An SEM analysis of the catalysts before reaction was conducted on a HRSEM, JSM 7401F. XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance diffracto- meter using nickel-filtered Cu K . radiation. The patterns were recorded for 10º < 2 < 70º. The BET surface area was obtained using a high resolution BET equipment described in the lit- erature [32,33]. 1.2 Catalyst activity evaluation Catalytic activity test experiments were carried out in a continuous flow, isothermal, fixed-bed reactor. The reactant H 2 O/DME feed ratio was fixed at 3.5, that is, with excess steam in order to lower the CO concentration by inducing the wa- ter-gas shift reaction in the reformer. The product stream composition was measured online using a gas chromatograph equipped with two TCD detectors. A Porapak T column was used for the separation of DME, MeOH, and H 2 O, and a TDX-01 column was used for the separation of H 2 , CO, and CO 2 . All tests were conducted in a reaction temperature range of 220–260 °C at atmospheric pressure with 1 g catalyst. The reactor (20 mm i.d.) was made of stainless steel and a space velocity of 4922 ml/(g·h) was used. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced with a H 2 /N 2 mixture by raising the FENG Dongmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(3): 223–229 temperature slowly to the reaction temperature over 10 h. The first sample of the effluent was taken 2 h after steady reaction conditions were established, and then samples were taken every 40 min. The final result shown is an average of five data points. DME conversion X, hydrogen yield Y, and CO 2 selectivity S were defined as follows: DME,in DME,out DME DME,in 100% FF X F u (5) 2 2 2 CO CO CO CO 100% F S FF u (6) where F DME , F CO , and F CO2 were the molar flow rates of DME, CO, and CO 2 , respectively. In and out denote the inlet and outlet molar flow rates, respectively. The hydrogen yield, a parameter used for the activity, was defined as the ratio of the molar amount of DME converted to hydrogen to the total molar amount of DME fed to the reactor. This was calculated by the following formula: 2 2 2 H DME,in H DME,in H 100% T F F Y FF � � u u � � (7) where F H2 was the effluent molar flow rate of H 2 . 61)( 2 HinDME, T FF was the theoretical molar ratio of DME feed and H 2 produced. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization The composition and specific surface area of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. As a reference catalyst, a commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst that is used in many plants in China for Table 1 Composition and BET surface area of the Cu-Zn-based catalysts Composition (mol %) Catalyst Cu Zn Al Zr Surface area (m 2 /g) Cu-Zn 66.67 33.33 0 0 54.8 Cu-Zn-Al 60.00 30.00 10.00 0 85.5 Cu-Zn-Zr 60.00 30.00 0 10.00 85.7 Cu-Zn-Al(c) * – – – – 33.6 Cu-Zn-Al-Zr 60.00 30.00 5.00 5.00 87.7 ZSM-5 – – – – 365.4 producing methanol from synthesis gas was used. The highest surface area was found for ZSM-5 (365.4 m 2 /g), while the commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst had the lowest surface area (33.6 m 2 /g). The BET surface area of the Cu-Zn-Al catalyst was 85.5 m 2 /g, as was that of the Cu-Zn-Zr catalyst. The BET surface area of the fresh Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst was 87.7 m 2 /g (Table 1). The surface area was larger with added Al and Zr content in the catalyst. Figure 1 shows SEM images of the catalysts. The commer- cial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst comprised irregular particles. The ap- pearances of our Cu-Zn-based catalysts were quite different, and these existed as regular one-dimensional nanomaterial agglomerates. The Al/Zr ratio had a clear influence on the morphology. The Cu-Zn catalyst had a cylindrical structure and the Cu-Zn-Al catalyst had a long fiber structure, while the Cu-Zn-Zr catalyst had both cylindrical and fiber structures. The Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst had both small grains and a film structure that was mainly a copper spinel with a one-dimensional fibrous structure. The fiber diameters were uniformly distributed and resulted in an increased catalyst surface area, which indicated that Cu-Zn-Al-Zr was potentially the best catalyst. Fig. 1.

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of our Cu-Zn-based cata- lysts and commercial Cu-Zn-Al after calcination. The XRD pattern of the commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst was different from those of our Cu-Zn-based catalysts. In the XRD patterns of the Cu-Zn, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Zn-Zr, and Cu-Zn- Al-Zr cata- lysts, there were weak peaks that can be assigned to CuO, which was the main component of these catalysts. These ap- peared at 2 = 35.5° and 38.6°. The CuO peaks overlapped the ZnO peaks at 2 = 36°. There were no peaks that can be as- signed to Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 , indicating that Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 ex- isted in an amorphous or microcrystalline state. As can be seen from the figure, our Cu-Zn series catalysts compared to the commercial catalyst had better dispersion, a smaller grain, and some miscellaneous peaks. The Cu-Zn-Zr and commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalysts had peaks at 2 = 31.8°, 34.3°, 36.2°, 47.4°, 62.8°, and 67.8°, which are the characteristics of ZnO diffrac- tion. A peak at 26.5° in the XRD pattern of the commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst was assigned to (Cu,Zn) 6 AlOH) 16 CO 3 · 4H 2 O, (which was a complex salt formed by the preparation method. In our previous paper [34], the width of the diffraction lines of CuO phases in the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst was wide. Under the same conditions, the copper diffraction peaks of the Cu-Zn catalyst was rather narrow and sharp, indicating that the particle size of CuO in the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst was smaller than those in the other Cu-Zn-based catalysts. The XRD and SEM analyses showed that the introduction of Al and Zr improved copper dispersion and distribution, promoted the spread of copper, and formed relatively small particles of copper. The special nano-fibrous structure resulted in a cop- per-based catalyst with a high surface area, which would also benefit the catalyst in activity and selectivity. 2.2 Effect of Cu-based compositions and temperature on DME SR The DME SR experiments were conducted with steam in excess of stoichiometry (H 2 O/DME molar ratio = 3.5) to ensure complete DME conversion and suppress CO formation by the reverse water-gas shift reaction CO 2 + H 2 = H 2 O + CO. The catalytic activities of the Cu-Zn-based/ZSM-5 catalysts for DME SR are summarized in Table 2. In all the reactions, the product gas contained H 2 and CO 2 as the major components, together with a small amount of CO. No other products, such as formic acid, methyl formate, and methane, were observed over any of the catalysts tested. From Table 2, it can be seen that the DME conversion and hydrogen production increased with increasing temperature and the preparation method has a significant influence on the performance of the catalysts. The Cu-Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst showed the lowest activity. With adding Al and/or Zr compo- nents to Cu-Zn, the activity increased significantly especially at higher temperatures. The conversion of DME and the hy- drogen yield over Cu-Zn-Zr/ZSM-5 were lower than those over Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5, indicating that the preparation method and fibrous morphology influenced the catalytic activity. The Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 catalyst showed a higher BET surface area and had a higher activity than Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5 and Cu-Zn-Zr/ZSM-5. The SEM observation of Cu-Zn-Al-Zr re- vealed the presence of a fibrous structure as shown in Fig. 1 and discussed above. Thus, it is likely that highly dispersed fibers were formed due to the addition of the Al and Zr com- ponents, and this resulted in the high activity and selectivity for DME SR obtained as shown in Table 2. These results strongly suggested that the dispersion of the Cu metal species affected the catalytic activity and selectivity, Table 2 Activity and selectivity of the Cu-Zn-based/ZSM-5 catalysts for DME SR at different reaction temperatures X(DME) / % Y(H 2 ) / % S(CO 2 ) / % Catalyst 220 °C 240 °C 260 °C 220 °C 240 °C 260 °C 220 °C 240 °C 260 °C Cu-Zn/ZSM-5 28.5 30.4 35.4 13.2 17.5 16.2 100 100.0 97.5 Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5 32.0 47.9 59.9 20.1 25.0 51.0 100 98.5 96.5 Cu-Zn-Zr/ZSM-5 29.1 42.2 55.8 17.1 25.4 49.0 100 98.1 96.2 Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 35.4 52.1 72.8 16.8 35.6 65.8 100 100.0 97.0 Cu-Zn-Al(c)/ZSM-5 20.4 34.2 48.1 7.7 21.2 35.0 100 100.0 96.0 FENG Dongmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(3): 223–229 and the aggregation of Cu species was inhibited by the addition of Al or Zr species to the Cu-Zn system. A better dispersion of Cu-Zn-Al crystallites was obtained with the proper addition of the Zr element. A key factor was that the catalyst existed in a more suitable (fibrous) morphology. These data clearly dem- onstrated that the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 catalyst was the best catalyst for the hydrogen production from DME SR. Compared to the commercial catalyst, the Cu-Zn-based catalysts produce significantly less CO at identical conversion levels. At 260 °C, the commercial catalyst gave 48% DME conversion and a CO 2 selectivity of 96%, where as the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 catalyst gave a DME conversion of 73% and a CO 2 selectivity of 97%. Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5 and Cu-Zn-Zr/ ZSM-5 had almost similar CO 2 selectivity. During DME SR over the Cu-Zn-based/ZSM-5 catalysts, CO is formed as a consecutive product by the water-gas shift reaction (reaction (3)), indicating that the reaction pathway of CO formation was the same for the Cu-based catalysts independent of their components and synthesis method. These results underlined that reactions (1) and (2) were the main reactions and CO formation was due to reverse water-gas shift and resulted in a decreased CO 2 selectivity. 2.3 Synergistic effect in DME SR It is generally believed that DME SR occurs as a combina- tion of the hydrolysis of DME (reaction (1)) and SR of methanol (reaction (2)). DME hydrolysis is reversible and thermodynamics limited. The reaction equilibrium was calcu- lated by the Gibbs free energy minimization method. The experimental DME conversion obtained in the reaction over the solid acid ZSM-5 and the calculated hydrolysis equilibrium were studied in our paper [34]. The high conversion over ZSM-5 in the low temperature range of 200 to 300 °C is due to the strong acid strength, whereas no activity was observed at temperatures below 150 °C. The hydrolysis of DME was lim- ited by the low equilibrium value (the conversion of DME at 250 °C was 18.5%) and it can be considered the rate limiting step of overall DME SR. The catalytic activity of Cu-Zn-Al-Zr for methanol SR was high under our conditions at 160 to 270 °C [35]. Because the hydrogen produced from DME is from the methanol SR that followed DME hydrolysis, both reactions were equally im- portant. The Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst has a high low-temperature activity and good selectivity for methanol SR. Although methanol SR was not the rate limiting reaction, its presence was highly significant because it rapidly removed the methanol from the hydrolysis of DME and increased the driving force of the hydrolysis reaction, which improved the DME conversion. The more active methanol SR, Cu-based catalyst gave the more active combined Cu-based + ZSM bifunctional DME SR catalyst. This indicated that the synergy of the coupled DME hydrolysis reaction and methanol SR reaction was prominent. Fig. 3. Reaction pathways for DME SR. A synergy of reaction-heat transfer was also present. Due to the synergy effects, a high one-pass DME conversion could be obtained and energy consumption was also less. Thus, hydro- gen production by DME SR is feasible with an effective bi- functional catalyst. A complete conversion of DME with very little CO produced can be obtained at about 260 °C. Agrell et al. [36] proposed a reaction sequence for the partial oxidation reaction over microemulsion catalysts consisting of consecutive methanol combustion and steam reforming, fol- lowed by decomposition when all oxygen has been consumed. We believe that the active site for DME hydrolysis to methanol is on the solid acid and the active site for methanol SR to hy- drogen production is on the Cu-Zn crystallites. Figure 3 shows the reaction network for DME SR. In the presence of water, reverse water-gas shift may contribute to the formation of CO as a consecutive product. The decomposition-water gas shift sequence has been suggested to be the reaction route for methanol SR over Cu catalysts [37–39]. CO formation can be suppressed by keeping the H 2 O/DME ratio in excess of stoichiometry, ensuring complete DME conversion and a low CO content. 2.4 Effect of reaction time on DME SR Figure 4 shows the dimethyl ether conversion as a function of reaction time for the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 catalyst. From Fig. 4. Effect of reaction time on DME SR over the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ ZSM-5 catalyst. Catalyst, 1 g; n(DME)/n(H 2 O) = 1/3.5; temperature, 240 °C. FENG Dongmei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(3): 223–229 Fig. 4, it can be seen that this bifunctional catalyst has good stability over 80 h, during which the DME conversion was almost constant. However, the reaction temperature had to be limited to less than 270 °C to avoid deactivation of the cop- per-based catalyst by Cu sintering. 3 Conclusions Five bifunctional catalysts with various compositions, Cu-Zn/ZSM-5, Cu-Zn-Al/ZSM-5, Cu-Zn-Zr/ZSM-5, Cu-Zn- Al-Zr/ZSM-5, and Cu-Zn-Al(c)/ZSM-5, were tested for DME SR. The choice of promoter and catalyst composition greatly influence DME conversion, H 2 yield, and selectivity to CO 2 . The highest conversion was obtained with Cu-Zn- Al-Zr/ZSM-5. The high activity of this catalyst was due to its preparation by the homogeneous precipitation method that gave highly dispersed Cu metal particles. A comparative study of DME hydrolysis over ZSM-5 and methanol SR over the Cu-Zn-Al-Zr catalyst was carried out. The bifunctional Cu-Zn-Al-Zr/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited high performance at low temperatures (220–260 °C) for DME SR. References 1 Isono T, Suzuki S, Kaneko M, Akiyama Y, Miyake Y, Yonezu I.

Research Paper Steam Reforming of Dimethyl Ether over Coupled ZSM-5 and Cu-Zn-Based Catalysts FENG Dongmei ZUO Yizan WANG Dezheng WANG Jinfu * Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Reaction Engineering and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-10-62797490; Fax: +86-10-62772051 Dimethyl ether (DME) steam reforming (SR) is one possible source of hydrogen for fuel cells. The synergistic effect of catalyst coupling for the DME SR process and the coupling of reaction-heat transfer was studied. A DME hydrolysis catalyst comprising ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25) and a series of methanol steam reforming catalysts (a series of Cu-Zn-based catalysts and a commercial Cu-Zn-Al catalyst) were used for DME SR. The evaluation of catalytic activity was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and N2 adsorption. The activity and selectivity were influenced by the catalyst composition and copper content, and also the content of Al and Zr. A Cu:Zn molar ratio of 60:30 together with Al and Zr gave the best dispersion of Cu crystals and the highest low-temperature catalytic activity, with a DME conversion of 72% at 260 °C and a space velocity of 4 922 ml/(g·h).
