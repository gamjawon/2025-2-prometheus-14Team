The structure properties of the catalyst were studied by means of XRD and the adsorption of N2. Acidity properties of the catalyst were tested by Hammett indicator method and Py-IR spectra. The reaction of esterification of n-pentanol with benzoic acid on catalyst was investigated as well. SO4 2−/TiO2/Al-pillared clay (ST/Al-PILC) superacid catalyst was prepared by loading active component SO4 2−/TiO2 on Al-pillared clay. The texture structure properties of the catalyst were studied by means of X-ray powder diffraction and the adsorption of N2. Acidity properties of the catalyst were tested by Hammett indicator method and FT-IR spectra of absorbed pyridine technique. The characterization results indicated that Al-PILC carrier could inhibit the formation of anatase TiO2 and the transformation of anatase TiO2 into rutile TiO2. ST/Al-PILC catalyst possesses both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, and the number of acid sites on ST/Al-PILC is much larger than that on Al-PILC carrier, but its acid strength is lower than that of ST. Experimental results show that ST/Al-PILC is an effective catalyst for esterification of n-pentanol with benzoic acid. Keywords Solid superacid Sulfated titania Al-pillared clay Catalyst Characterization 1 Introduction Pillared clays, a peculiar type of porous and high surface area solid material, have attracted considerable attention for application as catalysts, catalytic supports, and sorbents. They are prepared by intercalating polycations into the interlayer region of expandable clay materials. After calcination, the polycations were converted into robust metal oxide pillars, expanding the layers of the clay. Pillared clays can be used for many acid-catalyzed reactions [1–3], but they are less efficient for those reactions need strong acidity catalyst, which limits their application. Some attempts at improving and controlling the acidity of pillared clays have been done such as changing the type of the host matrix [4], varying the identity of the pillar [5] and introducing sulfate ion to the pillared clays [6,7]. Hence, we have attempted to enhance the acidity by loading SO4 2−/TiO2 on Al-pillared clay. SO4 2−/M x O y solid superacid (M x O y are usually some transition metal oxides such as ZrO2, TiO2, Fe2O3 and so on) is a new type of catalyst, it has some advantages such as its high acid strength, no corrosion for the reactor, and free from pollution. So it has been extensively used in many organic catalytic reactions of esterification, isomerization of n-alkanes, polymerization, acylation and so on. However, SO4 2−/M x O y also has some disadvantages such as hard to adjust its acidity and small in surface area. Recently, Liao et al. [8] and Lopez et al. [9] reported that it is helpful to add some new component to SO4 2−/M x O y , and a more effective way is to support SO4 2−/M x O y on the porous materials with high surface area [10–12]. In this paper, solid superacid catalyst (ST/Al-PILC) was prepared, its physical properties were studied by X-ray powder diffraction and the adsorption of N2. Acidity properties of the catalyst were tested by Hammett indicator method and FT-IR spectra technique. Catalytic activity of the catalyst was investigated by the esterification of pentanol with benzoic acid. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Bentonite was obtained from Ningmin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and its chemical composition is given in Table 1 . Other reagents used in this work were all A.R. 2.2 Preparation of ST/Al-PILC 2.2.1 Preparation of Al-PILC Ningming bentonite was purified by use of the sedimentation technique and converted to Na-bentonite by ion exchange reaction. Al-pillared clay was prepared by microwave irradiation method [13]. The Al-polyoxocation pillaring solution was prepared by drop-wise addition of 0.25M NaOH to 0.2M AlCl3 under vigorous stirring, with a molar ratio OH−/Al3+=2 and treated with microwave radiation for 10min. A concentration of 10% (by mass) clay suspension was prepared by adding Na-bentonite to the distilled water. Then Al-polyoxocation solution was slowly added to the clay suspension and stirred for 3h at 353K. The ratio of Al/clay was 5mmol of aluminum per gram of clay. The Al-pillared clay was separated by filtration and washed until chloride free, then was dried in an oven at 383K and calcined at 573K. 2.2.2 Preparation of ST/Al-PILC Al-PILC was impregnated with an aqueous solution containing the requisite quantities TiCl4 for 1h, then 28% (by mass) ammonia solution was added to the suspension until pH 8–9 under vigorous stirring. The solid was separated by filtration and washed until chloride free, dried at 383K and ground to 100–120 mesh. The powder was impregnated with a certain concentration of (NH4)2SO4 solution for 8h, followed by filtration, drying, and calcination in air at different temperatures for 3h. 2.2.3 Preparation of ST TiCl4 was gradually added to distilled water, then 28% (by mass) ammonia solution was added until pH 8–9 under vigorous stirring. The solid in the solution was separated by filtration and washed until chloride free, dried at 383K and ground to 100–120 mesh. The powder was impregnated with 1.0M (NH4)2SO4 solution for 8h, followed by filtration, drying, and calcination at 773K for 3h. 2.3 Sample characterization X-ray powder patterns had been recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX 2500V diffractometer, with a copper tube as radiation source (λ=1.54178Å) and operating at 40kV and 120mA, its profiles were recorded at 2° (2θ) per minute. The pore structures of samples were characterized on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 gas adsorption analyzer by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at liquid N2 temperature. Before measurements, the samples were degassed at 473K for 2h under vacuum. The average pore diameter was calculated using the BJH method based on the desorption isotherm, and surface area was calculated by using the BET method adsorption isotherm. The maximum acid strength of samples characterized by a Hammett indicator method. The sample was pretreated by being evacuated at 423K for 30min, then cooled to room temperature and contacted to the vapor of the Hammett indicator. The acidic strength was determined by observing the color change of the indicator adsorbed on the surface of the sample. The indicators used in this work were p-nitrofluorobenzene (H0=−12.44) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (H0=−13.75), the solvent used was n-heptane. FT-IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine on the sample were obtained by using a Spectrum 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers. The wafers were mounted in an infrared vacuum cell and degassed at 523K for 2h under vacuum (1×10−2 Pa). Then cooled to 383K and exposed to pyridine vapor for 15min, desorption was performed by evacuation at 523K. The sulfur content in the catalysts was detected by using a chemical method. Dehydrated Na2CO3 and ZnO were used as fusing agents, and the sulfate was turned into BaSO4 and determined by a gravimetric method. 2.4 Catalytic testing The esterification of n-pentanol with benzoic acid was used as a model reaction to test for the catalytic activity. The reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure and refluxing temperature in three-neck flask equipment with condenser and water separator, heated by a controlled electrical oven. The molar ratio of benzoic acid:n-pentanol was 1:3, the weight of a catalyst used was 8wt.% of benzoic acid. When the reactant system was heated to the reaction temperature, the catalyst was added into the system. The conversion of benzoic acid was measured by the final and initial acid value of the reaction mixture. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The acid strength of catalyst The acid strengths of the samples determined with the Hammett indicators are listed in Table 2 . From the table it can be seen that all ST/Al-PILC catalysts show lower acid strength than ST, although some of them also have superacidity. The acid strength decreases with the decrease in the loading of TiO2. When the loading of TiO2 is less than 29.5wt.%, the samples have no superacidity. In the following work, 29.5wt.% was chosen as the loading of TiO2 on the Al-PILC. 3.2 The Lewis and Brönsted acidity of catalyst FT-IR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine (Py-IR) were used to distinguish the Lewis and Brönsted acid sites on the sample. Fig. 1 displays the Py-IR spectra of ST/Al-PILC and Al-PILC. In the region 1400–1700cm−1, three peaks due to CC stretching vibrations of pyridine are observed. The peak at 1447–1449cm−1 was assigned to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, the peak at 1544–1545cm−1 is characteristic of pyridine adsorbed on Brönsted, while the peak at 1490cm−1 appears commonly for pyridine adsorbed on both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites. From the Py-IR spectra we can see that the number of acid sites on ST/Al-PILC is much larger than that on Al-PILC carrier. 3.3 The texture structure of catalyst The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of samples calcined at different temperatures for 3h are shown in Fig. 2 . The results revealed that TiO2 is in an amorphous state when the sample was calcined at 573K, the formation of anatase TiO2 started beyond 673K, all the diffraction peaks (2θ=25.3°,37.9°,48.0°,55.0°) of anatase TiO2 appeared when calcination temperature is up to 773K, and no lines due to rutile TiO2 were observed even when the calcination temperature is as high as up to 973K. According to literature [14], for SO4 2−/TiO2 superacid, the formation of anatase TiO2 starts beyond 573K, and some apparent diffraction peaks of rutile TiO2 were observed after calcination at 948K. Hence, it can be proposed that Al-PILC carrier inhibited the formation of anatase TiO2 and the phase transition from anatase to rutile crystalline form. The X-ray patterns of samples also indicated that the support Al-PILC has interacted with ST when calcined at higher temperatures, because some diffraction peaks of Al-PILC disappeared or changed. 3.4 The surface area and the average pore diameter The average pore diameter and the BET surface area of samples are given in Table 3 . As can be noted from this table, there is a decrease in the average pore diameter and surface area of the sample after loading. This may be partly due to some of the TiO2 particles entering into the pores of Al-PILC and partially plugging the pores. 3.5 The sulfur content of the catalysts Fig. 3 depicts the effect of (NH4)2SO4 solution concentration on the SO4 2− loading of the samples. From Fig. 3 it can be seen that the SO4 2− loading increased linearly with the (NH4)2SO4 solution concentration when [(NH4)2SO4]<1.0M and changed insignificantly when [(NH4)2SO4]>1.0M. This may be due to the SO4 2− loading approached maximum as [(NH4)2SO4]=1.0M. 3.6 The catalytic properties of catalyst The effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity was shown in the Fig. 4 . The results show that the catalytic activity of ST/Al-PILC calcined at 773–873K is higher than that at other temperature, and climax appeared at 823K. In the case of ST, when the thermal treating temperature reaches over 823K, its activity usually drops significantly because of the loss of sulfur absorbed on the surface. It is known that the generation of super acid sites in the system of SO4 2−/M x O y solid superacid is necessarily promoted by the sulfur of the metal oxides [15], the more acid sites formed, the higher catalytic activity exhibited. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that Al-PILC carrier can effectively retard the loss of sulfur during the calcination and enhance the thermal stability of catalyst. Fig. 5 shows the influences of the concentrations of the (NH4)2SO4 impregnating solution on the catalytic activity of ST/Al-PILC (calcined at 823K), the conversion of benzoic acid increases with the increase of the SO4 2− concentration in the low concentration range and reaches the maximum when [SO4 2−]=1.0M. After that it decreases with the increase of [SO4 2−]. This may be explained that it is unfavorable for forming sulfur complexes when SO4 2− concentration is low, and excessive SO4 2− on the catalyst surface forms inactive sulfate species, which cover the active sites. 4 Conclusions Al-PILC supported SO4 2−/TiO2 (ST/Al-PILC) catalyst for esterification was prepared, and its acid strength is lower than that of ST. Py-IR spectra showed that ST/Al-PILC catalyst possesses both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites, and the number of acid sites on ST/Al-PILC is much larger than that on Al-PILC carrier. The X-ray patterns indicated that Al-PILC carrier can inhibit the formation of anatase TiO2 and the transformation of anatase TiO2 into rutile TiO2. ST/Al-PILC calcined at 823K and impregnated with 1.0M (NH4)2SO4 solution exhibited the best catalytic activity for esterification of n-pentanol with benzoic acid.
