The structure and catalytic properties of BiCeVMoO catalysts with different composition for selective oxidation of propane have been investigated. It has been shown that bismuth may be substituted by a low amount of cerium while the Scheelite structure of BiVMoO remains unchanging. With the increasing of Ce (Ce/(Ce+Bi)>0.15), new phases of CeVO4 and Ce2(MoO4)3 formed. The cerium which probably entered into the lattice of BiVMoO promotes the forming of acrolein, and the selectivity to acrolein increased to a maximum at Ce/(Ce+Bi) atomic ratio=0.15 (45mol% at ∼30mol% propane conversion). Further increasing Ce content results in further oxidation of propylene and acrolein to CO x due to the strong oxidative ability of catalysts. The proper amount of introduced cerium, which probably occupied the lattice sites of Bi3+ enhanced the oxidative ability of catalysts moderately by increasing the activity and the amount of surface active oxygen species. Graphical abstract Incorporation a low amount of Ce into the lattice of BiVMoO improved the catalytic performance for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein remarkably. The role of additive Ce in the reaction has been investigated. Keywords BiCeVMoO composite oxides catalyst Propane Selective oxidation Acrolein 1 Introduction Direct oxidation of propane to acrolein could be an interesting alternative to propylene oxidation, and it has attracted much attention for a long time world widely. Bi–Mo-based catalysts have been heavily studied for the selective oxidation (ammoxidation) of propylene to acrolein (acrylonitrile). The scheme of the reaction has been established [1–4] and the role of Bi and Mo are proposed [5–7]. It has been revealed that incorporating V into BiMoO enhanced the activity and selectivity of catalyst for direct oxidation of propane [8–11], the promotion effects are investigated and discussed [5,12]. Our previous work have shown that the V in tetrahedral BiVO4 can be substituted by Mo and forming the tetrahedral MoO species which has moderate catalytic activity for selective oxidation of propane [13]. Cerium has a strong capability as an oxygen carrier [14], low amount of Cerium can accelerate the circulation of reduction–oxidation of catalyst [15], Sleight concluded that Ce can been incorporated into Sheelite structure of ABO4 and occupied the A position [12]. It is inferred that catalysts containing cerium might exhibit different catalytic properties for the selective oxidation of propane. In this study, we try to incorporate Ce into BiVMoO (Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4) catalyst in an effort to further improve the performance of catalysts for the partial oxidation of propane and try to elucidate the role of Ce in the reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalysts preparation The composite oxides catalysts of BiCeVMoO were prepared by evaporating a complex of desired metal ions solution of citric acid and oxalic acid at 60°C, Ce3+ was added into Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 according to the (Ce+Bi)/V/Mo=0.85/0.55/0.45 of molar ratio and Bi3+ was substituted by Ce3+ step by step. All samples were dried overnight in air at 110°C and then treated in dry air at 600°C for 6h. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests The catalytic experiments were performed in a fixed bed continuous flow stainless steel tubular reactor (20mm i.d.) under atmospheric pressure, 0.5g of catalyst diluted by 2g 20–40 mesh quartz was packed and tested over a temperature range of 480–500°C. A gas mixture was feed at a ratio of V(C3H8):V(O2):V(N2)=45:56:10 with GHSV of 1800h−1 (no inner and outer diffusion effects were observed under this condition). Post-reaction gases were analyzed online by GC to determine the propane conversion and product distribution. 2.3 Test of propene oxidation by lattice oxygen Molecular oxygen oxidation of propylene were conducted at 500°C with a feed of pure propylene into a U-shape stainless steel tubular reactor (2mm inner diameter, 30mg catalyst), pure He (after deoxygenated) flowed at a rate of 40ml/min and carried the propylene to the reactor via a 6-way valve, before the reaction were carried, the samples were preheated at 500°C with He flowing for 5h to remove the possible adsorbed surface oxygen. The pulse amount of propylene was 1.65μmol and the products were analyzed on-line by GC. 2.4 Catalytic characterization XRD patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu-3A diffractometer using a radiation source of nickel-filtered Cu Kα (λ =0.15418nm) operating at 35kV and 15mA. FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a RFS-100 FT-Laser Raman spectrometer (Bruker) with an InGaAs detector cooled by liquid nitrogen, Raman excitation at 1064nm provided by Nd-YAG laser resource was used for excitation, the laser power applied on samples was 100mW and the wave number accuracy was 4cm−1. For TPR measurement, 30mg catalysts samples were charged in a U-shape quartz tubular reactor and were heated linearly at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 under a flowing H2–Ar mixture (6.0% H2 by volume) of 35mlmin−1. The consumption of hydrogen was detected by an on-line GC. 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of catalysts with various Ce fractions are shown in Fig. 1 . In the Sheelite type structure of Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 mixed oxides, Bi3+ is octahedral by oxygen [12] while V5+ and Mo6+ are tetrahedral [12,13] by four coordinated oxygen atoms. For the samples with Ce/(Ce+Bi) atomic ratio ≤0.15, XRD patterns showed no evident difference from the pattern of Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4, no obvious information associated with Ce were observed under the experiment conditions. For samples with Ce/(Ce+Bi)>0.25, the profiles showed typical crystallites diffraction peaks of CeVO4 and Ce2(MoO4)3, and with the increasing of Ce contents, crystallites peaks intensity of CeVO4 kept increasing. XRD could not detect the crystallites of CeO2 and CeVO4 in the mechanical mixture of CeO2 +Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 and CeVO4+Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 with Ce/(Ce+Bi)=0.15 neither, so more sensitive methods were needed for studying the present state of Ce with low contents in BiCeVMoO. The FT-Raman spectra of BiCeVMoO catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 , Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 sample exhibited two Raman bands at 887 and 820cm−1 which could be assigned to the vibration of tetrahedral MoO and VO species, respectively [16,17]. The spectra of BiCeVMoO samples with Ce/(Ce+Bi)≤0.15 showed no obvious difference from the spectrum of Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4, but the spectra of mechanical mixture of CeO2 +Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 and CeVO4 +Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 with Ce/(Ce+Bi) atomic ratio 0.15 showed Raman bands at 464.3 and 861.7cm−1, respectively which are characteristic Raman features for crystalline CeO2 and CeVO4 [18] (p′ and p″ in Fig. 2A). These results suggest that low amount of additive Ce into CeBiVMoO catalysts (with Ce/(Ce+Bi)≤0.15) may be incorporated into the Sheelite structure of BiVMoO and occupied the position of crystal Bi [12]. When the composition of BiCeVMoO catalysts varied to Ce/(Ce+Bi)>0.25, the spectra exhibited a Raman band at 861.7cm−1, which is the characteristic Raman band for CeVO4 [18], and the intensity of the peak kept increasing with the increase of Ce content, indicates the crystal CeVO4 formation in BiCeVMoO mixed oxides, this was consistent with the results by XRD. The catalytic results obtained during the oxidation of propane on BiCeVMoO catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . Under about 30mol% of propane conversion, the selectivity of cracking products varied not much but the selectivity of propene and acrolein associated closely with the Ce content in catalysts. With the increase of Ce contents, complete oxidation products CO x (CO and CO2) changed not much incipiently but propylene selectivity decreased gradually, while acrolein selectivity kept increasing. When the composition of catalyst reached the vicinity of Ce/(Ce+Bi) atomic ratio of 0.15, acrolein selectivity attained maximum (about 45mol%). After this, with the further elevation of Ce/(Ce+Bi) molar ratios, propylene selectivity kept almost constant but acrolein selectivity decreased gradually while complete oxidation products CO x increased sharply. Published data showed that propylene is the probable intermediate products during the selective oxidation of propane to acrolein [8,10], our reactivity studies indicates that proper addition of Ce into BiVMoO mixed oxides catalysts improved the performance of converting propane to acrolein via propylene, but exceeding Ce caused over oxidation of propylene on the catalysts. For investigating the role of low amount of additive Ce, we studied the oxidative ability of metal cations and the selective propylene oxidation activity of lattice oxygen species in catalysts. Shown in Fig. 4 are H2–TPR profiles of the BiCeVMoO catalysts with Ce/(Ce+Bi)≤0.15. Two peaks around 740 and 797°C were observed for sample without Ce (curve a in Fig. 4, Ce/(Ce+Bi)=0.00), after partial substitution of Ce for Bi, peak around 740°C kept constant while the peak at higher temperature (peak at 797°C) shifted obviously to the lower temperature, this indicates that Ce doped catalysts are more easily to be reduced and the lattice oxygen combined with metal cations are more active. For revealing the activity of lattice oxygen in BiCeVMoO catalysts, the catalysts were performed with pulse of propylene. Shown in Fig. 5 are the total acrolein yields by pulse of propylene (1.65μmol/pulse) to almost complete deactivation of catalysts, and estimated amount of lattice oxygen capable of selectively oxidizing propylene to acrolein (represented by LOC). It can be found that with the substitution of Ce for Bi into Bi0.85V0.55Mo0.45O4 catalyst, acrolein yield and LOC enhanced gradually, indicating that after the partial substitution of Ce for Bi, the amount of lattice oxygen which can participate in propylene selective oxidation increased, because the lattice oxygen species are the main active species for partial oxidation of propane to acrolein via propylene [13], so this low amount of introduced Ce get rise to the yield of acrolein. The partial oxidation of propane follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism [14], after partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein, the consumed lattice oxygen are compensated by gas-phase oxygen, probably the additive Ce can accelerate the reoxidation process in the reduction–oxidation cycle of catalysts. Shown in Fig. 6 are the temperature programmed re-oxidation profiles of catalysts after oxidation of propylene by lattice oxygen. To the catalyst without Ce, its TPO profile exhibited two oxygen consumption peaks around 403 and 481°C, respectively, compared to the complementary detecting of CO2 by mass spectroscopy to the exist gas of TPO of catalyst (shown in Fig. 7 ), these two peaks could be assigned to the contribution of oxygen consumption by the combustion of carbon deposit on the surface of catalyst. To the samples with additive Ce, TPO profiles showed oxygen consumption peaks in the range <300°C, and the intensity of the peaks increased remarkably with the increase of Ce contents; this suggests that for the presence of Ce in catalysts, the lost lattice oxygen by oxidation of propylene can be regenerated in lower temperature, and simultaneously, the oxygen consumption peaks shifted obviously toward more lower temperature position with the increase of Ce contents, indicating the Ce can promote the regeneration of active lattice oxygen species. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, it is reasonable to infer that proper amount of Ce may be incorporated into crystal lattice of the Sheelite structure of Bi–V–Mo–O, occupies the crystal lattice position of substituted Bi without obvious changing of the crystal structure of the catalysts. When the Ce content exceed a certain amount, i.e. Ce/(Ce+Bi)>0.25, the structure of catalyst can not hold and new crystalline CeVO4 as well as Ce2(MoO4)3 formed, oxidative ability is strong that the desired product acrolein were easily to be over oxidized to CO x . Ce doped catalysts has a improved catalytic activity for selective oxidation of propane to acrolein for the proper amount of Ce in the samples. Ce in the crystal structure of BiCeVMoO can promote the selective oxidation activity of the lattice oxygen species in catalysts, enhance the amount of lattice oxygen which can participate in propylene selective oxidation and simultaneously can accelerate the regeneration of active oxygen species.

It has been shown that bismuth may be substituted by a low amount of cerium while the Scheelite structure of BiVMoO remains unchanging. With the increasing of Ce (Ce/(Ce+Bi)>0.15), new phases of CeVO4 and Ce2(MoO4)3 formed. The cerium which probably entered into the lattice of BiVMoO promotes the forming of acrolein, and the selectivity to acrolein increased to a maximum at Ce/(Ce+Bi) atomic ratio=0.15 (45mol% at ∼30mol% propane conversion). Further increasing Ce content results in further oxidation of propylene and acrolein to CO x due to the strong oxidative ability of catalysts. The proper amount of introduced cerium, which probably occupied the lattice sites of Bi3+ enhanced the oxidative ability of catalysts moderately by increasing the activity and the amount of surface active oxygen species.",
