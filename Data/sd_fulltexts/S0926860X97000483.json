China Received 20 May 1996; received in revised form 22 November 1996; accepted 7 January 1997 Abstract The effects of COS in synthesis gas on the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis over a commercial Fe-Cu-K catalyst in a fixed- bed reactor under 2.31 MPa and at 524 K were investigated. Activity of catalyst decreased rapidly within the first few hours, and then slowly when COS in the syngas was in the range of 51.4-245.6 ppm, while the activity changed little during 72 h when the COS concentration was 4.8 ppm. Prepoisoning of the catalyst was more serious than poisoning in situ. The sulfur resistance of larger catalyst particles was stronger than that of smaller particles and the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was faster on smaller pellets. A deactivation model in a fixed-bed reactor for F-T synthesis was developed in this paper. Deactivation rate constants obtained from nonlinear regression with the model decrease with the increase of COS concentration, suggesting that the deactivation of catalyst is faster at lower COS concentrations than at higher COS concentrations. The calculated results from the model fitted well with the experimental data. The selectivities of methane and gaseous C2-C4 hydrocarbons increased when the catalyst was poisoned by COS. The C~ content in product decreased significantly with increase of sulfur fed to the catalyst. The alkene to alkane ratio in gaseous hydrocarbons decreased over the poisoned catalyst, but C7--C4 in total C2--C4 hydrocarbons changed only slightly. XPS, XRD and TEM studies showed that sulfide compounds were formed on the poisoned catalysts, but the structures were different with variation of COS concentrations, due to the formation of monolayer or mutilayer sulfides on catalysts. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The sulfur poisoning of an iron catalyst for ammo- nia synthesis was observed about 80 years ago [1]. In 1935, a practical upper limit of sulfur concentration, 1 to 2 mg S m 3 of synthesis gas for F-T synthesis was reported [2], and most commercial applications of this *Corresponding author.

It is well known that the sulfur poisoning of iron catalysts is one of the most serious deactivation problems in commercial production of substitute natural gas from coal [3,4]. Only a few ppm of H2S may reduce catalyst activity in a few hours and the catalyst life is reduced to a few weeks or even a few days [5-9]. The commercial Fe-Cu-K catalyst prepared by the Institute of Coal Chemistry (ICC) for a demonstration 0926-860X/97/$17.00 (C, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00048-3 138 Z-T. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 137-151 plant has been proved to be very active in F-T synth- esis [10]. In order to estimate the catalyst life in sulfur- containing synthesis gas, and to provide data for reactor design, it is necessary to study the effect of sulfur on this catalyst and to develop a deactivation model. Sulfur poisoning experiments are difficult to per- form because the sulfur compounds are easily absorbed by the materials of the reaction system, and special gas cylinders are therefore required for the storing mixtures of synthesis gas with sulfur- containing component. The reaction system for sulfur poisoning tests should be made of stainless-steel in contact with the gas stream throughout. Anderson and coworkers [11,12] studied the effect of sulfur com- pounds on the fused catalyst in F-T synthesis and found that the poisoning on the fused iron catalyst decreased in the following order: SO2>H2S> CzH5SH>COS. Hydrogen sulfide in synthesis gas is easier to be removed than carbonyl sulfide (COS), and COS is more stable in reaction systems, so we selec- tively studied the effect of COS on F-T synthesis. In this paper, we investigated the effects of poison- ing methods (prepoisoning and poisoning in situ), COS concentrations in feed, and catalyst particle size on F-T synthesis in a fixed-bed reactor over the commercial catalyst, and also develop a deactivation model for COS poisoning. The deactivation rate expression is based on the intrinsic kinetic models of F-T synthesis. The effects of COS on the activity, the selectivity and the product distribution for F-T synthesis were also discussed. The deactivation beha- vior for different COS concentrations was explained by XPS, XRD, and TEM. 2. Experimental The composition of Fe203-CuO-K20 catalyst was 100Fe/0.3Cu/0.5K20, the BET surface area of catalyst was 155 m2 g-l, the pore volume 0.35 cm3 g-l, and the average pore diameter 80 ,~. The samples were reduced in situ under the pressure of 0.5 MPa with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1500 at 523 K for 32 h in H2/CO=2.1 syngas before tests. The reactor was made of stainless-steel tube 12 mm i.d. and 430ram in length. The reactor center was equipped with a 3 mm i.d. thermocouple. The gas feed flow rate and the reaction temperature were controlled by a Teledyne-Hastings Mass Flow meter (Hastings) and a DTC-10 temperature controller (ICC), respectively. The products formed in F-T synthesis first passed through a middle pressure trap to condense high carbon number waxes (Cj6-C5o) products, then passed through an ice-salt cooled trap to collect liquid products, such as water and oil (C4- C25). The exit gas finally passed through a wet flow meter, and was stored in a storage trap. The catalysts employed here were 8-10 ml. The poisoning tests were carried out in H2/CO containing COS concentrations of 4.8, 51.4, 162.7 and 245.6 ppm. The relative activity of poisoned catalyst was defined as the activity of the poisoned catalyst divided by the activity of the unpoisoned catalyst at the start of poisoning. In a previous paper [13], we studied the effects of catalyst diffusion on F-T synthesis. It is found that the external diffusion effect could be neglected when the GHSV is greater than 1800 h-~, and the intra-particle diffusion could be ignored while the catalyst particle size was reduced to 0.3 mm (60 mesh), and hence, we employed the catalyst particle size of 80 to 100 mesh and the GHSV values greater than 1800 h- l during the deactivation kinetic tests. An SP-2305 gas chromatograph equipped with a column of 5 A zeolite molecular sieve was used to analyze Ha, CO, CH4, and N2 in syngas and in gaseous products. The COS content was analyzed by GC-7A gas chromatograph using a column filled with GDX- 103. The gaseous hydrocarbon products formed in F-T synthesis were analyzed by model 102 gas chromato- graph filled with an octadecane column. The GC-9A gas chromatograph was used to analyze the composi- tion of oil (C4-C25), and the waxes after pretreatment. The organic oxygenates formed in water phase were analyzed by model 103 gas chromatograph. The con- tent of CO2 was analyzed by Orsat apparatus on line. The analysis conditions are summarized in Table 1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) ana- lysis of samples was investigated on a PHI 5300 ESCA SYSTEM spectroscopy using Mg K~ (1253.6eV) radiation. The spectrometer was run in fixed retarding ratio (FRR) mode at a pass energy of 71.55 eV and with target power of 250 W (12.5 kV x 20 mA). Spec- tra were recorded at pressures below 1.0x 10-6 Pa. All sample binding energies were referred to carbon (ls) Z.-T.

XRD was carried out on a Rigaku Dmax-rA dif- fractometer, operating at 40 kV, 50 mA, using a Cu target and graphite monochromator. The range of scanning was 20:40-80\". TEM was tested on an H-600 scanning transmission electron microscopy. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of COS concentration of 4,8 ppm on catalyst activi~,for F-T synthesis The relative activity of Fe-Cu-K catalyst poisoned by COS of 4.8 ppm (6.9 mg S m 3) in syngas at 524 K and under 2.31 MPa is given in Table 2. The relative activity increased within the first few hours, then changed a little within 72 h, suggesting that an upper limit for COS of 6.9 mg S m- 3 in syngas may be allowable for the catalyst tested. The upper limit for total sulfur of 1 to 2 mg S m -~ in syngas for F-T synthesis was reported by Fischer [2]. The difference resulted from the used catalysts and the kind of sulfur. Fischer used a fused iron catalyst, with a surface area of 14.5 m2 g-l, but here we used a precipitated cata- lyst with surface area of 155 m2g i Anderson [41 investigated the effect of various sulfide compounds on the F-T synthesis over fused catalysts, and found that the poisoning by sulfide compounds decreased in the following order: SO2>H2S>C2HsSH>COS. The catalyst activity changed a little in containing COS of 6.9 mg S m-~ (4.8 ppm) synthesis gas within 72 h poisoning test for F-T synthesis over Fe-Cu-K cata- lyst studied in this paper. This suggests that the resistance of Fe-Cu-K catalyst to sulfur is much greater than that of the fused catalyst reported by Fischer. However, the difference is that the resistance Table 2 The changes of activity poisoned by sulfur concentration of 6.9 mg S m as COS Test no. CO+H2 conv.

Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 161 (1997) 137-151 to sulfur of 1 to 2 mg S m-3 refers to the resistance of the fused catalyst to total sulfur not only to COS. On the other hand, the catalyst surface areas are quite different. The surface area of the fused catalyst only has 1/10 of the coprecipitated catalyst, so the resis- tance to sulfur of Fe-Cu-K catalyst is much higher than the fused catalyst. The 6.9 mg S m 3 in the synthesis gas may not be suitable for the upper limit for F-T synthesis in industry, because it refers to resistance to COS not to the total sulfur. As total sulfur consists of COS, H2S, and SO2 in synthesis gas by gasifying coal, and the poisoning by H2S and SO2 is much greater than COS, the upper limit for total sulfur should be less than 6.9 mg S m-3. 3.2. Effect of poisoning method on F-T synthesis The prepoisoning referred to the absorbed amount of sulfur by the catalyst before being tested in F-T synthesis. The poisoning in situ was carried out in sulfur-containing syngas during F-T synthesis. The results of poisoning in situ and prepoisoning of Fe- Cu-K catalyst are shown in Fig. 1. The effects of the poisoning methods on product distribution are listed in Table 3. In both processes, the relative activity decreased with the increase of sulfur fed to catalyst, and decreased to 0.5 when 2.41 and 3.92 mg of sulfur per gram of catalyst had been fed to catalyst by prepoisoning and poisoning in situ, respectively. 1.0 0.8 0.6 .~ .,,..a < \"...~ e'J \"~ 0.4 poisoning in situ o prepoisoning 0.2 J ! !

Fig. 1 also shows that prepoison- ing of reduced Fe-Cu-K catalyst was more serious than poisoning in synthesis gas phase. These results are in agreement with Karn's results [8]. Karn studied the effects of H2S on steel lathe turning L2201 and fused iron D3001 catalysts by different poisoning methods. It is reported that poisoning by H2S in the gas phase was more serious than prepoisoning by immersing the pretreated catalyst in a solution of sulfur compound in heptane for reduced catalyst D3001. It is found that the difference resulted from the fact that by the time of beginning of the gas phase poisoning, the surface area had already decreased from 14.8 to 1.0 square meter per gram of iron because of oxidation during synthesis. However, for the acti- vated steel turning catalyst, prepoisoning became more serious than gas phase poisoning, and the surface area of steel turning catalyst remained essentially constant during poisoning. Karn found that the activity of fused iron catalyst decreased to half when 0.16 to 0.22 mg of sulfur per gram of iron, corresponding to 0.24 to 0.33 mg sulfur per gram of catalyst had been introduced, which was much smaller than that of the precipitated Fe-Cu-K catalyst studied here, i.e. the commercial coprecipitated catalyst was much more sulfur resisting. The H2/CO usage ratio increased when the catalyst was poisoned by COS in both processes, but the rate of increase was different at the same sulfur content. The H2/CO usage ratio was larger on catalyst poisoned in situ than that prepoisoned. The selectivity of methane increased greatly when the catalyst was poisoned by COS. The selectivity of C2-C4 hydrocarbons was also increased over poisoned catalyst for F-T synthesis. However, the extent of increase was different in 142 Z-T. Liu et aL/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 137-151 different processes. The yields of C+ and C~- decreased significantly over poisoned catalysts. The C~- weight percentage in products decreased when catalysts were poisoned, indicating that the hydrocar- bon product distribution shifts toward the lighter hydrocarbons (Ct-C4). The alkene to alkane ratio formed in gaseous hydrocarbon products decreased over poisoned catalyst. The ratio of CO2/H20 formation increased in pre- poisoning, but decreased in poisoning in situ. There is a net conversion of hydrogen to water besides the synthesis of hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon monoxide, l(m + 2n)H2 + nCO ~ CnHm 4- nH20 (1) It is generally recognized that water is the initial oxygen-containing product and the dominant factor contributing to the usage ratio of H2/CO is the sec- ondary water-gas shift (WGS) reaction H20 + CO f CO2 + H2 (2) For each mole of water not taking part in the shift to CO2, one more mole of water is consumed, and then the usage ratio of H2/CO is less than the inlet ratio in synthesis gas. The H2/CO usage ratio increased in poisoned catalyst, and almost reached the ratio in the feed gas. This suggests that the water-gas shift reac- tion is suppressed over poisoned catalyst. The CO2/ H20 ratio in product decreased in poisoning in situ, but increased in prepoisoning process, showing that the water-gas shift reaction was more serious on the prepoisoned catalyst, so H2/CO usage ratios in the prepoisoning were smaller than that of poisoning in situ as shown in Table 3. 3.3. Effect of catalyst pellet size on F-T synthesis over poisoned catalyst The effect of panicle size on the poisoned catalyst is presented in Fig. 2. Increasing the external surface area of catalyst by decreasing particle size from 20 to I00 mesh, the relative activity decreased rapidly. The relative activity of 80 to 100 mesh and 20 to 40 mesh catalyst decreased to 0.5 when 4.00 or 5.54 mg of sulfur per gram of catalyst had been fed to the catalysts, respectively. When the sulfur fed to catalyst was greater than 12.4 mg per gram of catalyst, the relative activity was less than 0.2, but the relative 1.O 0.8 7, 0.6 ~' 0.4 0.2 80-100 mesh 0 20-40 mesh 0.01 !

The relative activity of different catalyst pellet size versus sulfur fed to catalyst. activity of 80 to 100 mesh catalyst was lower than that of 20 to 40 mesh catalyst. It is reported [8,14] that catalyst oxidizes extensively during the early pan of synthesis tests to leave only a thin layer of porous, active material near the outside of the particle. The poisoning of the internal surface is more difficult for larger panicles, so the activity decreases slower than that of smaller panicles at the same sulfur fed to catalyst. This suggests that the poisoning reaction is so fast that the diffusion limitations prevail in espe- cially larger catalyst particles. To explain the activity observed for different size catalysts, it may be postu- lated that the thickness of active layer increases with the increase of pore diameter, i.e., with decrease of surface area of the same kind of catalyst. The atomic concentration distributions of reduced catalyst from the surface to the bulk are listed in Table 4.

The source of carbon in catalyst can be ascribed to metallic carbide, CO0 , CO and graphite carbon. The H2/CO usage ratio and CO2/H20 ratio in product of different catalysts poisoned by H2/CO containing 232.4 mg S m-3 as COS in F-T synthesis are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Both H2/CO usage ratio and CO2/H20 ratio decreased with increase of sulfur fed to catalyst for 20 to 40 mesh catalyst. However, the H2/CO usage ratio for 80 to 100 mesh catalyst increased within the first few hours when poisoned by COS, then decreased as the sulfur fed to catalyst increased. The CO2/H20 ratio decreased at the begin- ning of poisoning, then increased with increase of sulfur fed to catalyst. This indicates that the water-gas shift reaction is more active on smaller pellet size catalyst. o 20-40 mesh .2\"0~mesh 0 4 8 12 Sulfur fed to catalyst, mg S g\"! Fig. 3.

The selectivity to methane increased significantly over poisoned catalyst. The C~ content in hydrocarbons decreased greatly in a few hours, but changed a little until the relative activity decreased to less than 0.2. The C2-C4 gaseous hydrocarbons content formed in product also increased when the catalyst was poi- soned. However, the content of alkene in C2-C4 hydrocarbons changed only slightly during the poi- soning process. The C~- yields decreased greatly over poisoned catalyst. The poisoned catalyst produced more gaseous hydrocarbons, less wax and gasoline than that of the unpoisoned catalyst. 3.4. Catalytic tests and kinetic modeling 3.4.1. Deactivation rate equations Several researchers have studied the sulfur deacti- vation rates and the parameters that influence these rates [15-23]. Anderson et al. proposed an empirical rate equation [24] -ln(1 - Y)= (A/G)exp(-E/RT), (3) where Y is the fraction of H2+CO reacted; G, the hourly space velocity; A is a constant; and the activa- tion energy E has a value of 19 kcal molr 144 Z.-T.

Wentreck et al. [7] developed a model for H2S poisoning of alumina-supported nickel and ruthenium catalysts in fixed beds, based on the deactivation rate equation expressed as follows: ds r~ =di = KdnB, (4) where rd is the rate of deactivation, Kd the deactivation rate constant, n the concentration of HzS and B the density of sulfur adsorption sites. Bartholomew et al. [ 17,25] modified this model to allow for activity-time behavior da rd = --~ = Kdna, (5) where a is the normalized activity (specific activity at any time t divided by flesh activity) based on the assumption that a=S/So, where So is the initial site density for sulfur adsorption. In this paper, we develop a model with an activity function which relates to the sulfur amount absorbed on the catalyst. The activity function is expressed as Wp ~l = 1 Wsp' (6) where Wse is the saturation sulfur amount adsorbed on catalyst; and Wr~ the adsorbed sulfur on catalyst at any time. The deactivation rate should be proportional to the activity function as well as the sulfur concentration in the bulk mixture d~/ Rd -- dt -- kpllCp, (7) where Co (mmol cm-3) is the sulfur concentration in syngas; and kp (cm3 mmo1-1 s-1) is the deactivation rate constant. From Eqs. (6) and (7), we obtain dT1 1 dWv (8) dt Wsp dt In the case of one independent variable (time), a simple relation may be reached = ~o ef-~cp dr. (9) Z-T. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 137-151 145 3.5. Discrimination of integral experimental data It is well known that the deactivation problem can be expressed by a proper set of PDE's. However, on the basis of the purpose of this work, analyzing the experimental data from a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor, a method directly combining the numerical treatment and the model itself is chosen here so as to avoid too much computational efforts, which are not allowed on a PC computer in our case. The mass balance of sulfur in a fixed-bed reactor can be carried out on the basis of the change of the sulfur amounts in the bulk flow and on the catalyst. For this purpose, we define the sulfur flow rate in the bulk flow as mp (mmol s 1). Therefore, we have mp(Z, t) = F(z, t)fp(Z, t), (10) where F is the volume rate of bulk flow (cm3 s i). Using the lumping approach developed by Liu et al. [ 13] Fo F(z,t)=~M(z,t), M(z,t) =MQX(z,t). (11) Fig. 5 shows that sulfur flows entering and existing the reactor bed. On the basis of Fig. 5, the sulfur balance of the fixed bed at certain time can be easily written as dWp dmp]t- dt Pc dVRI,= -Wsekp~lCpPc dVRIr, (12) where Pc is the bulk density of the catalyst bed (g cm 3). From Eqs. (10) and (11), we have dmp],= F dCp],+Cp dF],, (13) Fo Fo dFl,= ~dMl,= -~GQdXI,. (14) Substituting Eqs. (13) and (14) into Eq. (12), and rearranging it leads to dCp Mf QCp dX d(V~-Fo) ,= ~ [. ~ d(V~F Defining the space time T as WSPpckp1ICp I \" (15) VR r = --.

(17)-(19), the CO conversion X under deactivation conditions can be calculated, if the q can be properly determined on the basis of the operation time (t) and sulfur balances under poisoning condi- tions. 3.6.

If the t direction is divided into a proper number of intervals, then integrating Eq.

It is clear that rl('ri,tj) can be easily determined if the Cp(~-i,tj) has been calculated from Eqs. (17)-(19) des- cribed above, leading to an approximate simplification from PDE's to ODE's. ~/(7-,tj) can be calculated by using Eqs. (22) and (23). The mass balance Eqs. (17)- (19) can be integrated by using standard integrating procedure like the fourth-order Runge-Kutta-Gill algorithm used in the work. The parameters, kp and Ws~ are here regressed by using Marquardt nonlinear regression method over the ~ calculation and integra- tion programs, using the object function as following: Fob = Z(Xexp - Xcal)/Xexp. (24) 3.7. Poisoning experimental and simulation of deactivation rate model Poisoning results of reduced catalyst containing different COS concentration at 524 K and under 2.31 MPa are shown in Fig. 6. The relative activity of catalyst decreased rapidly within the first few hours, and finally decreased at a slow rate. The relative activity almost diminished to zero when 8.04, 15.82, or 20.85 mg of sulfur per gram catalyst had been introduced for 51.4, 162.7 and 245.6ppm as COS in syngas, respectively. The deactivation rate decreases with increase of COS concentrations. The CO conversion calculated from deactivation rate model based on the deactivation experimental data (Table 6) and the CO conversion obtained in experi- ments fitted well as shown in Table 7. 1.00 b 0.60 ~ 0.40 eL 0.20 (A) '-~ 0.00 I - J ~'~ , 0 5 I0 15 20 25 Sulfer fed to catalyst, mg S g-t Fig. 6.

The experimental values are 8.04, 15.82 and 20.85 mg S g-l, the devia- tions are 7.5%, 4.9% and 1.3%, respectively, which indicates that the deactivation model is suitable for our studied process. The deactivation rate constants calculated from deactivation model are listed in Table 8. The deacti- vation rate constant decreases with increase of COS concentration, this being in agreement with the experi- mental phenomena as shown in Fig. 6. 3.8.

However, the contents of n-alkane and iso- alkane increased when catalyst was poisoned by COS. This trend indicates that the sulfur may adsorb on the hydrogenation active sites of catalyst at first, so the secondary hydrogenation activity relatively increased as compared with unpoisoned catalyst. The increase of organic oxygenate formed in water also identified this point. 3.9. Characterization of catalyst 3.9.1. Sulfur balance In the poisoning of COS concentration of 162.7 ppm for F-T synthesis over pretreated Fe- Cu-K catalyst, the catalyst bed was divided into three equal sections and the catalyst of each part was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectro- meter (Atomscan 16, Thermo Jarrell Ash) at the end of the test. The data in Table 10 indicate that the uppermost layers of catalyst completely absorb the sulfur during poisoning process, and the sulfur ana- lysis of poisoned catalyst showed the high enrichment of sulfur in the upper part of the catalyst was exam- ined. The protective action on the subsequent catalyst layers is one of the advantages of a fixed-bed reactor. The total sulfur fed to catalyst calculated from the amount of COS in feed gas was 15,82 mg S g-~, which corresponds to the amount of sulfur obtained by chemical analysis of 15,02 mg S g--J. 3.10. XPS, XRD and TEM tests The catalyst deactivation rates may result from the formation of either a sulfur of different structure and stoichiometry at lower COS concentration (51.4 ppm) 148 Z.-T.

The BE of 710.9 eV for Fe2P3/2 and the BE of 161.9 eV for S2p correspond to FeS, while the BE of 706.6 eV for Fezt%.2 and 168.1 eV for S2p ascribed to FeS2. The sulfur exists mainly in the form of FeS on catalyst 2, but exists largely in FeS2 on catalyst 3. It is well known that Fe304 and FeO are active phases for F-T synthesis [10]. However, the Fel_xS also has activity for F-T synthesis. FeS2 formed in higher COS concentration may convert to Fe~_xS during F-T synthesis, and the vacant space of iron 150 Z.-T. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 161 (1997) 137-151 is active for F-T synthesis [26]. The reasons for decrease of catalyst activity can be ascribed to the sulfur chemisorption on metal surface which either prevents or modifies the adsorption characteristics of other reactant molecules, in many regards it resembles the behavior of the additive in bimetallic catalysts [27,28]. Sulfur adsorption on a metal surface causes two types of poisoning: blockage of catalytic site (geometric effect) and changes in catalytic activity of the metal due to the influence of neighboring sulfur atoms (electronic effect). The geometric effect plays an important role over the entire sulfur coverage range and dominates in high-sulfur-coverage regions [29,30], while the electronic effect is considered to be operative only at low sulfur coverages [31,32]. The sulfur compounds formed during poisoning processes may affect the activity of catalyst, so the deactivation rates are different with variety of COS concentrations as shown in Fig. 6. The sulfur poisoning of catalyst can be described as follows: 3Fe203 + H2 ~ 2Fe304 + H20 (26) (2 - x)Fe304 + 4(2 - x)Hz + 9S 3FeS2 + 3Fel_xS + 4(2 - x)H20 (27) (1 - x)FeS2 + (1 - 2x)H2 ~ Fel_xS + (1 - 2x)H2S (28) Fe304 + 4H2 + 3S --+ 3FeS + 4H20 (29) 4.

Fax.: +86 28 5216676 The effects of COS in synthesis gas on the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis over a commercial FeCuK catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor under 2.31 MPa and at 524 K were investigated. Activity of catalyst decreased rapidly within the first few hours, and then slowly when COS in the syngas was in the range of 51.4–245.6 ppm, while the activity changed little during 72 h when the COS concentration was 4.8 ppm. Prepoisoning of the catalyst was more serious than poisoning in situ. The sulfur resistance of larger catalyst particles was stronger than that of smaller particles and the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction was faster on smaller pellets. A deactivation model in a fixed-bed reactor for F-T synthesis was developed in this paper. Deactivation rate constants obtained from nonlinear regression with the model decrease with the increase of COS concentration, suggesting that the deactivation of catalyst is faster at lower COS concentrations than at higher COS concentrations. The calculated results from the model fitted well with the experimental data. The selectivities of methane and gaseous C2–C4 hydrocarbons increased when the catalyst was poisoned by COS. The C5 + content in product decreased significantly with increase of sulfur fed to the catalyst. The alkene to alkane ratio in gaseous hydrocarbons decreased over the poisoned catalyst, but C2 =–C4 = in total C2–C4 hydrocarbons changed only slightly. XPS, XRD and TEM studies studies showed that sulfide compounds were formed on the poisoned catalysts, but the structures were different with variation of COS concentrations, due to the formation of monolayer or mutilayer sulfides on catalysts.
