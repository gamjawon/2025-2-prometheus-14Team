Polyaromatic compounds that carry several side residues of d-glucose, d-galactose, and d-mannose were synthesized from hydroquinone β-glucoside (arbutin) through two successive enzymatic reactions: glycosylation of the glucose residue in arbutin, followed by oxidative polymerization of the hydroquinone moieties. In the first step, Bacillus macerans cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, B. circulans β-galactosidase, and jack bean α-mannosidase were used to obtain glycosylation products in yields of 56.0, 29.5, and 25.2%, respectively, where the main products were a series of α-1,4-linked glucosyl/maltooligosyl arbutin, β-1,4-linked galactosyl arbutin, and α-1,6-linked mannosyl arbutin, respectively. In the second step, horseradish peroxidase was used and the enzyme efficiently polymerized glycosyl arbutin(s) together with the remaining arbutin using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. The water-soluble products, glycosyl poly(arbutin)s, showed approximate molecular weight distribution of 0.5–25kDa which was estimated by gel permeation chromatography calibrated with maltooligosaccharides and pullulan markers. There were no differences in the phenolic main chain structures of glycosyl poly(arbutin)s and poly(arbutin), where the binding of neighboring hydroquinone moieties occurred at ortho-positions. Glycosyl poly(arbutin)s containing α-linked mannose and β-linked galactose residues exhibited increased absorbability to immobilized concanavalin A and castor bean lectin (RCA120), respectively. Keywords Arbutin Glycosylation Polymerization Peroxidase Lectin 1 Introduction Peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of various aromatic compounds using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an electron acceptor (oxidant) [1–7]. The enzyme has been applied to remove unfavorable aromatic compounds from wastewater by converting them into insoluble precipitates [5]. The enzyme has also been attracting interest as a catalyst for the synthesis of polyaromatic compounds [1–4,6,7] because of the novel structures of products, mild reaction conditions, and avoidance of poisonous organic solvents, compared to conventional polymerization processes. Recently, Wang et al. reported the polymerization of 4-hydroxyphenyl β-d-glucoside (hydroquinone β-glucoside, arbutin, Arb) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP), where the binding of adjacent hydroquinone moieties occurred at ortho-positions [6]. However, the authors subsequently removed the glucose (Glc) residues of the product, poly(Arb), by acid hydrolysis to obtain poly(hydroquinone), a redox-active polymer with possible applications for batteries, sensors, and antioxidants. As far as we know, however, no attention has been paid to poly(Arb), a water-soluble polymer retaining Glc residues, which may cause biological responses when the glycosyl structures are appropriately modified. This report deals with the synthesis of the glycosylated derivatives of poly(Arb)s, which have several additional d-Glc, d-galactose (Gal), and d-mannose (Man) residues on poly(Arb). Introducing these glycosyl residues influences their binding affinity to lectins. The synthetic methodology involves two successive enzymatic reactions (Fig. 1 ): glycosylation of the Glc residues of Arb with glycosylating enzymes, and the co-polymerization of Arb and several resulting glycosyl Arb with HRP. These syntheses were carried out in a one-pot system, and therefore, troublesome isolation of the glycosylated products was avoidable and Arb was sufficiently utilized for the polymer synthesis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Arb, lactose (Lac), d-mannose (Man), and methyl α-mannoside (Me-Man) were purchased from Nakalai Tesque Co. (Tokyo). α-Cyclodextrin (α-CD) and maltooligosaccharides were supplied by the Bio Research Corporation of Yokohama (Yokohama). Concanavalin A (ConA)–sepharose and castor bean lectin (RCA120)–agarose were commercial products of Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo). Pullulan for molecular weight markers were purchased from Showa Denko Co. (Tokyo). The other chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. 2.2 Enzymes HRP and jack bean α-mannosidase (α-Mase, EC 3.2.1.25) were purchased from Toyobo Co. (Kyoto) and Sigma Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively. Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) from Bacillus macerans and β-galactosidase (β-Gase, EC 3.2.1.23) from B. circulans were supplied by Amano Enzyme Inc. (Nagoya) and Daiwa Kasei Co. (Shiga), respectively. 2.3 HPLC High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed under two conditions using a Shimadzu LC-10AD (Shimadzu, Kyoto) equipped with a Shimadzu RID-10A refractive index detector (RI) and a SPD-10AV UV–vis detector (UV): (1) condition (A) for sugar analysis; column, Polyspher CH-Pb (Showa Denko, Tokyo); temperature, 80°C; solvent, H2O; flow rate, 0.4ml/min. (2) Condition (B) for gel permeation chromatography (GPC); column, Shodex OHpak SB-802.5HQ (fractionation range for proteins, less than 50kDa; exclusion limit of pullulan, 10kDa; Showa Denko Co.); temperature, 40°C; solvent, 25mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1M NaCl; flow rate, 0.7ml/min. The composition of glycosylation mixtures was measured under condition (B) using distilled water as a solvent. 2.4 Spectrometry 2.4.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at 75MHz (13C) or at 300MHz (1H) with a JEOL AL-300 FT NMR spectrometer (Tokyo). Glycosyl Arb(s) were dissolved in D2O, and acetone (δ 31.4ppm) was added as a shift reference. Deglycosylated polymers for 1H and 13C NMR analyses were prepared as described in Section 2.9 and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. 2.4.2 Mass spectrometry Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) was performed using Voyager™ (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA). α-Cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid was used as a matrix. 2.4.3 Infrared spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was measured with a Shimadzu FTIR-8300 spectrometer. Deglycosylated polymers in KBr pellets were used for the measurement. 2.5 Enzymatic glycosylation of Arb 2.5.1 α-Glycosylation with CGTase A reaction mixture (2.0ml) containing 250mg Arb, 250mg α-CD, 25mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0), and B. macerans CGTase [8,9] (25U/ml) was incubated at 40°C for 24h. After incubation, the mixture was boiled for 10min to stop the reaction, filled up to 5.0ml with water, filtered, and the resulting solution was used for HRP-catalyzed polymerization as described in Section 2.7 or for product isolation as described in Section 2.6. 2.5.2 β-Galactosylation with β-Gase A reaction mixture (0.5ml) containing 250mg Arb, 250mg Lac, 25mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0), and B. circulans β-Gase [10] (10U/ml) was incubated at 40°C for 4h. After the incubation, the mixture was treated similarly to that described in Section 2.5.1. 2.5.3 α-Mannosylation with α-Mase A reaction mixture (about 0.3ml) containing 250mg Arb, 1500mg Man, 0.4ml of 25mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0), and jack bean α-Mase [11] (0.1ml, 1.75U) was incubated at 55°C for 48h. After the reaction, the mixture was treated similarly to that described in Section 2.5.1. 2.6 Isolation of glycosyl Arb(s) 2.6.1 α-Glycosylation product The glycosylation mixture appropriately diluted with water (about 5.0ml) was loaded onto a column of Bio-Gel P-2 (2.5cm×93cm, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) equilibrated with 5.0% (v/v) ethanol. The elution was performed at 20ml/h, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Saccharides in the fractions were monitored using the phenol–sulfuric acid method, ultraviolet adsorption at 260nm, and thin-layer chromatography. The fractions were separated into three parts that contained each of products B1–B3 in Fig. 2B. Products B2 and B3 were subjected to re-chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2. The preparations, thus, obtained were evaporated and lyophilized. Product B1 (isolated yield, 76mg) and product B2 (32mg) appeared as single peaks in HPLC analysis under condition (B). The preparation of product B3 (17mg) contained small amounts of other saccharides (purity judged by peak area, 86%). 2.6.2 β-Galactosylation product Abundant products C1 and C3 in Fig. 2C were purified almost similarly to that described in Section 2.6.1 except that Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography was repeated twice for each. Product C1 was accompanying with a shoulder in HPLC analysis under condition (B) (isolated yield, 37mg; purity, 90%). Product C3 (15mg) eluted as a single peak of unsymmetrical shape. 2.6.3 α-Mannosylation product Abundant product D2 in Fig. 2D was purified almost similarly to that described in Section 2.6.1. Product D2 (isolated yield, 21mg) eluted as a single peak in HPLC under condition (B). 2.7 Polymerization with HRP The glycosylation mixtures obtained as described in Section 2.5 were diluted appropriately with water (3.0ml, 50mg as Arb/ml, 0.551mmol). To the solutions were added HRP (250μg, 1.67μg per mg of Arb) and then 6% (2.36M) H2O2 solution drop by drop (20μl each at 5-min intervals) to become 1.5mol equivalent to the glycosides (about 0.83mmol). The mixtures were incubated at 20°C for 4h with gentle stirring. 2.8 Separation of glycosyl poly(Arb)s After polymerization, the mixtures were put onto a column (1.0cm×14cm) of ODS-AQ (Organo Co., Tokyo) equilibrated with water. After washing with water, the polymers were eluted with 25% ethanol, collected, evaporated, and dialyzed exhaustively against distilled water in dialysis tubes (with a molecular weight cut-off of 12kDa, Japan Medical Science Co., Osaka). After exhaustive dialysis, the samples were lyophilized and stocked at −20°C. 2.9 Acid hydrolysis of poly(Arb) and glycosyl poly(Arb)s The reaction mixtures (0.4ml) containing the polymers (absorbance at 260nm, A 260, 460–490) and 2.0M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were boiled for 2h. The black precipitates were washed with water several times using centrifugation. The supernatant solutions were combined, evaporated, and lyophilized. The samples were dissolved in water (0.4ml), filtered, and subjected to the HPLC analysis performed under condition (A) to determine the sugar components. The precipitates, deglycosylated polymers, were dried well under reduced pressure and used for IR and NMR analyses as described in Section 2.4. 2.10 Adsorption of glycosyl poly(Arb)s to immobilized lectin Columns (1.0cm×1.5cm) of ConA–sepharose and RCA120–agarose were equilibrated with 25mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1M NaCl. Poly(Arb) and glycosyl poly(Arb)s (about 75μg) dissolved in the buffer (10–20μl) were loaded onto the columns at 15°C. After washing the gels with the buffer (5.0ml), sequential elution was carried out with either 2mM and then 20mM Me-Man in the buffer (for ConA) or 2mM and then 10mM Lac (for RCA120). The polymers were measured with A 260. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Enzymatic glycosylation of Arb 3.1.1 α-Glycosylation by B. macerans CGTase The Glc residue in Arb was effectively transglycosylated by B. macerans CGTase [8] as reported by Sugimoto et al. [9]. As shown in Fig. 2B-(1), CGTase gave several transfer products (peaks B1–B3, etc.). The total yield of transfer products was 56.0% from the reduction in Arb. Products B1–B3, which were separated by gel filtration, gave molecular ion peaks ([M+Na]+) at m/z 457, 619, and 782 in MALDI–TOF-MS, indicating that they were glucosyl, glucobiosyl, and glucotriosyl Arb(s) (Glc-Arb–Glc3-Arb), respectively. The following ratios were quantified according to the UV adsorption intensities on the HPLC analysis: Arb (44.0%), Glc-Arb (24.4%), Glc2-Arb (13.8%), Glc3-Arb (7.9%), and larger transfer products (9.9%). Glc-Arb, the simplest and the most abundant product, was confirmed to be 4-O-α-glucosyl Arb [9] with 13C NMR (Table 1 ), and the more elongated products were reasonably estimated to be α-1,4-linked maltooligosyl Arb(s) according to the well-known action of CGTases [8,9]. 3.1.2 β-Galactosylation by B. circulans β-Gase Four products (C1–C4) were detected in the transgalactosylation of Arb as shown in Fig. 2C-(1). A total transfer yield of 29.5% was estimated based on the reduction in Arb. Abundant products C1 and C3 were suggested to be galactosyl Arb (Gal-Arb) and further glycosylated Arb with two Gal residues (galactobiosyl Arb or di-galactosyl Arb collectively abbreviated as Gal2-Arb) from the molecular ion peaks at m/z 457 and 619 detected by TOF-MS, respectively. 13C NMR analysis indicated that product C1 contained two glycosides, 4-O-β-galactosyl Arb and 3-O-β-galactosyl Arb. The major glycoside was identified as 4-O-β-galactosyl Arb principally because of the carbon signal assignable to 4′ (79.4ppm), which shifted to the downfield region (8.8ppm) compared with the corresponding signal of Arb at 70.6ppm (Table 1). Smaller peaks were assigned to the minor glycoside, 3-O-β-galactosyl Arb. This gave a peak at 85.5ppm, which was assignable to the shifted signal of 3′ carbon (data not shown). Byproduct C2 with unidentified linkage(s) seemed to be another galactosyl Arb from its elution position in HPLC. In summary, the composition of the products was: Arb (70.5%), Gal-Arb (product C1, 15.0%; C2, 0.9%), Gal2-Arb (product C3, 12.3%), and product C4, (1.3%). 3.1.3 α-Mannosylation by jack bean α-Mase Jack bean α-Mase [11] mannosylated 25.2% of Arb in the condensation (reverse hydrolysis) reaction of Man and Arb. Main product D2 (Fig. 2D-(1)) was identified to be 6-O-α-mannosyl Arb (Man-Arb) from TOF-MS ([M+Na]+ at m/z 457) and 13C NMR analyses (Table 1), where the carbon signal assignable to 6′ (67.8ppm) had a downfield shift value of 6.0ppm from the corresponding 6′ signal of Arb (61.8ppm). Byproducts D1 and D3 were considered to be another mannosyl Arb and further glycosylated Arb with two Man residues (mannobiosyl Arb or di-mannosyl Arb collectively abbreviated as Man2-Arb), respectively, from the elution positions on HPLC. The reaction mixture consisted of Arb (74.8%), Man-Arb (product D1, 5.0%; D2, 17.0%), and Man2-Arb (product D3, 3.2%). 3.2 Polymerization of Arb and glycosyl Arb(s) with HRP The HRP-catalyzed polymerization was performed in a one-pot system after enzymatic glycosylation of Arb. After the addition of HRP to the glycosylation mixtures, the oxidant (H2O2) solution was added drop-wise to prevent the inactivation of HRP. A red–brown color developed with the progress of the reactions. Fig. 2 shows the GPC chromatogram for the reaction mixtures. The reaction occurred efficiently: Arb and glycosyl Arb(s) disappeared completely to form polymerized products (retention time, 9–14min). The polymerization was also specific for phenolic glycosides: although the mixtures contained Arb and glycosyl Arb(s) as well as substrates and hydrolysis products, etc., the phenolic glycosides were selectively polymerized and the usual saccharides such as Glc, Gal, Lac, and Man remained unchanged. In this report, poly(Arb) derivatives with additional side residues of Glc, Gal, and Man are abbreviated as Glc n -poly(Arb), Gal n -poly(Arb), and Man n -poly(Arb), respectively, and these polymers are collectively referred as glycosyl poly(Arb)s. 3.3 Properties of glycosyl poly(Arb)s 3.3.1 Purification Poly(Arb) and glycosyl poly(Arb)s were retained in dialysis tubes (12kDa cut-off), and smaller saccharides were diffused out. The polymers were also adsorbed to the ODS resin. After washing with water, the polymers were eluted with ethanol solutions. Alternatively, they are separable as precipitates in the presence of ethanol (50–66%, v/v). In this study, the polymers were purified by ODS chromatography followed by dialysis as described in Section 2.8. 3.3.2 Glcosyl side chain residues The sugar compositions of glycosyl poly(Arb)s and poly(Arb) were determined after hydrolysis with TFA (Table 2 ). The results prove that glycosylated Arb(s) (monomers) are incorporated into the polymers; Glc n -poly(Arb) showed a 2.5-times higher Glc/A 260 ratio, which represented the frequency of Glc residue to the phenolic backbone, than the other polymers, indicating the former contained additional Glc residues. It was also confirmed that Gal and Man residues exist in the respective glycosyl poly(Arb)s. The percentages of Gal/Glc (38.9%) and Man/Glc (31.3%) were somewhat larger than the respective glycosylation yields (29.5% and 25.2%) because of the existence of the glycosyl Arb(s) with multiple residues such as Gal2-Arb and Man2-Arb. The average structures of the polymers are shown in Fig. 3 . Since HRP-catalyzed polymerization occurred efficiently, the frequency of the side residues could be estimated from the ratios of glycosyl Arb(s) to free Arb. The glycosylation yields in the reactions of CGTase (56.0%), β-Gase (29.5%), and α-Mase (25.2%) implied that the polymerized products possessed approximately 5–6, 3, and 2–3 of the introduced glycosyl residues in every 10 Arb backbone units, respectively. Similarly, it was roughly estimated that Glc n -poly(Arb) contained Glc-Arb–Glc3-Arb at a ratio of 3:2:1, and that Gal n -poly(Arb) contained Gal-Arb and Gal2-Arb at a ratio of 2:1. In Man n -poly(Arb), Man-Arb was the predominant constituent. We assume that the glycosyl residues are randomly distributed in the polymerized products since HRP does not appear to strictly recognize Arb or glycosyl Arb(s) as substrates, which is evidenced by the fact that Glc-Arb, Glc2-Arb, Glc3-Arb, Gal-Arb, and Man-Arb showed almost the same decreasing rates as Arb during polymerization (data not shown). 3.3.3 Phenolic backbone structure Poly(Arb) and glycosyl poly(Arb)s were hydrolyzed with TFA to remove glycosyl residues for the elucidation of the polymer backbone structure. The deglycosylated polymers derived from glycosyl poly(Arb) gave almost the same 13C NMR spectra as that from poly(Arb) [6]: broad and splitting carbon peaks were observed at δ 16–124ppm assignable to C-2, -3, -5, and -6, and at δ 143–154ppm assignable to C-1 and -4 of hydroquinone moiety. In 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 4 ), broad signals ascribable to aromatic proton and phenolic hydroxyl proton were observed at around δ 6.7ppm and δ 8.7–9.3ppm, respectively, which were coincidental with the previous data of poly(hydroquinone) [6,7] obtained from HRP-catalyzed synthesis. Splitting of the latter peak may be due to two phenol groups in hydroquinone moiety. The signal area of the aromatic proton was almost twice larger than that of the phenolic hydroxyl proton, which may be attributable to inaccurate integration of the spreading signals. There were also no significant differences in the IR spectra of the deglycosylated polymers. Following typical adsorptions suggested the polymers were constructed of similar phenolic main chains; at 3350cm−1 due to the O–H linkage, at 1601 and 1507cm−1 due to the CC linkage in aromatic ring, and at 1198cm−1 due to the C (aromatic)-OH linkage. From these results, we concluded that glycosyl poly(Arb)s had the same hydroquinone backbone structure as poly(Arb) [6,7], which was reported to have linkages at the ortho-positions among adjacent hydroquinone moieties (Fig. 1). 3.3.4 Molecular weight Fig. 5 shows the GPC chromatogram of the polymers in HPLC analysis. Poly(Arb) and three glycosyl poly(Arb)s eluted in an almost same retention time range of 9–14min, which corresponded to an approximate molecular weight distribution of 0.5–25kDa, when maltooligosaccharides and pullulan were used as marker substances. The peak top positions of the glycosylated polymers were also similar and their molecular weight value was estimated to be approximately 3.2kDa, which corresponded to a polymerization degree of about 12. Shoulder and small peak were observed in a higher molecular weight region of around 12–24kDa. The molecular size of poly(hydroquinone), which was derived from poly(Arb), was reported to be 1.6–3.2kDa, which was estimated by GPC calibrated with polyethylene glycol markers [6]. The apparent molecular weight elucidated for the most abundant glycosyl polymer species (3.2kDa), therefore, was considered to be reasonable, when the presence of sugar residues in the polymers and the difference in the marker substances used were taken into account. The polymers, however, did not diffuse through a dialysis membrane with a cut-off size of 12kDa as described in Section 3.3.1. This may be attributable to the particular molecular shape or aggregate formation of the polymers. Detailed molecular sizes and structural properties especially in aqueous solutions, therefore, remains a topic to be studied. 3.3.5 UV adsorption spectra Glycosyl Arb(s) showed the same UV-spectrum as Arb, and an adsorption maximum was observed at around 280nm. The spectra of poly(Arb) and glycosyl poly(Arb)s were also the same and showed a broad, gentle adsorption peak at around 300nm (data not shown). The solution of the polymers was reddish brown, although no obvious adsorption maximums were observed in the visible region. 3.4 Adsorption to immobilized lectins Lectins are proteins that react reversibly with specific sugar residues. Concanavalin A (Con A) from the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) binds molecules that contain α-d-mannopyranosyl, α-d-glucopyranosyl, and sterically related residues [12]. RCA120 from the castor bean (Recinus communis) specifically recognizes β-d-galactopyranosyl residue [13]. This study evaluates the interactions of the polymers with these two lectins in terms of absorbability to immobilized lectins (Fig. 6 ). Most Man n -poly(Arb) was adsorbed to the immobilized Con A gel under the experimental conditions and eluted with Me-Man, whereas about 50–70% of poly(Arb) and other glycosyl poly(Arb)s showed no absorbability. Man n -poly(Arb) separated into two fractions, one eluted with 2.0mM and the other with 20mM Me-Man. The density and/or length of the glycosyl residues seemed to cause these different behaviors. Gal n -poly(Arb) was adsorbed almost entirely to immobilized RCA120 and eluted with the Lac solution, whereas the other polymers showed no interactions. These behaviors coincided with the binding specificity of RCA120 lectin [13]. 4 Conclusions The methodology presented here provides a one-pot synthesis of polymers constructed from the hydroquinone backbone and Glc side residue, some of which carry additional glycosyl residues. This synthetic strategy involves two enzymatic reactions. First, the Glc residue of Arb is glycosylated by appropriate enzymes. The introduced linkages depend on the regio- and stereo-selectivity of the glycosylating enzymes used. In addition to the CGTase, β-Gase, and α-Mase used in this report, other glycosydases and glycosyltransferases may be similarly applicable to give more variations for the side chains. Glycosyl Arb and the remaining Arb were subjected to the second polymerization step. The oxidative polymerization by HRP proceeded efficiently, and thus the frequency of the introduced side residues can be controlled by the glycosylation yields in the first step. Furthermore, when a certain glycosyl Arb is isolated and used as a monomer, a polymer with a uniformed side chain structure is expected to be synthesized similarly. The resulting glycosyl poly(Arb)s are regarded as kinds of so-called artificial glycoconjugate polymer or glycopolymer that mimic biological glycoconjugate molecules [14]. Artificial glycopolymers constructed from the main chains of polypeptides, polysaccharides or vinyl polymers with glycosyl side chains have shown wide applicability in cell biology because of their affinity with certain cells or lectin-like proteins [14]. Furthermore, the potential application of some glycopolymers are considered in the medical field, for example, for use as materials for tissue cell culture, as inhibitors for binding of viruses or bacteria to cells, or as neutralization agents for bacterial toxins. From the viewpoint of application, therefore, glycosyl pol(Arb)s with binding affinity to lectins may have similar potential usefulness. References [1] J.S. Dordick M.A. Marletta A.M.

In the first step, Bacillus macerans cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, B. circulans β-galactosidase, and jack bean α-mannosidase were used to obtain glycosylation products in yields of 56.0, 29.5, and 25.2%, respectively, where the main products were a series of α-1,4-linked glucosyl/maltooligosyl arbutin, β-1,4-linked galactosyl arbutin, and α-1,6-linked mannosyl arbutin, respectively. In the second step, horseradish peroxidase was used and the enzyme efficiently polymerized glycosyl arbutin(s) together with the remaining arbutin using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. The water-soluble products, glycosyl poly(arbutin)s, showed approximate molecular weight distribution of 0.5–25kDa which was estimated by gel permeation chromatography calibrated with maltooligosaccharides and pullulan markers. There were no differences in the phenolic main chain structures of glycosyl poly(arbutin)s and poly(arbutin), where the binding of neighboring hydroquinone moieties occurred at ortho-positions. Glycosyl poly(arbutin)s containing α-linked mannose and β-linked galactose residues exhibited increased absorbability to immobilized concanavalin A and castor bean lectin (RCA120), respectively.",
