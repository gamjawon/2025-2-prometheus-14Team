Chun, M. Shirai, K. Tomishige, K. Asakura, Y. Iwasawa * Department of Chemistr),, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan Abstract A chamber for observation in situ of polarized total-reflection fluorescence extended X-ray absorption fine structure (PTRF- XAFS) spectra was constructed, which makes it possible to measure the PTRF-XAFS spectra in situ under preparation, treatment, and reaction conditions from high vacuum( 1 10 9 Pa) to high pressure( 1 X 105 Pa) and from low temperature( 100 K) to high temperature( 800 K). The PTRF-XAFS technique can provide information on asymmetric or anisotropic structure of active metal and metal-oxide sites supported on single crystal substrates as models for supported catalysts, by measuring bondings of supported species in two or three different directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface independently. Typical EXAFS and XANES spectra for Cu2+/a-SiO2 (000l), CoOx/o!-Al203 (0001), [Pt]a/ff-Al203 (0001), and V2Os/ZrO2 (100) taken by the PTRF-XAFS chamber are discussed in relation to their catalytic properties.

Introduction Structures of metal and metal-oxide sites at support surfaces which show catalytic perform- ance may be asymmetric or anisotropic, reflecting asymmetric or anisotropic structures of support surfaces and asymmetric or anisotropic interaction mode at the interface between metal or metal oxide and support. Their structures may also change asymmetrically or anisotropically during treat- ment of catalysts under vacuum, H2, or 02, or under catalytic reaction conditions.

All rights reserved SSD11381-1 169(95)00163-8 reaction mechanisms, detailed information is needed on the structure and dynamic change of active sites in two-three different directions. This sort of molecular-level information may provide a way to improve conventional catalysis to more efficient performance and also a way to develop new selective catalytic systems [ 1-3 ]. EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine struc- ture) and XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) have been well recognized to be a pow- erful technique to characterize catalytic materials [4,5 ]. In the case of powder samples such as typ- ical heterogeneous catalysts, the structures deter- mined by the above XAFS (X-ray absorption fine structure) technique in a traditional transmission mode are averaged structures in every direction of a sample, which prevents the structures at catalyst 56 W.-J. Chun et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 55-65 surfaces being precisely characterized. When flat substrates such as single crystals, polished glasses and amorphous substrates, and so on, are employed as supports, however, characterization of metal and metal-oxide sites on them can be achieved separately in two different bond direc- tions parallel and normal to the surface by polar- ized X-rays stemming from synchrotron radiation. EXAFS oscillation x(k) is given by Eq. (1) based on a single scattering theory [ 6,7 ]. x(k) =ENi*A*(k) sin(2kR~+qbi(k)) (1) A*(k) = Fi(k) exp( - 2o-2k2) exp( - 2Ri/ Ai( k ) )/kR2 (2) where Ni*, Ri and o'i( k ) represent effective coor- dination number of the ith shell, interatomic dis- tance and phase shift function. Fi(k), qbi and Ai stand for amplitude function, Debye-Waller fac- tor and mean free path of photoelectron. Effective coordination number (Ni*) of K-edge XAFS spectra has a cosine square dependence on the angle (0j) between polarization direction of the electric-field vector of the incident X-ray and direction of bonding or direction of the unoccu- pied bound state orbital (Eq. (3)) [ 8 ]. In the case of Lxn-edge spectra, Ni* is expressed by Eq. (4) [8]. For K-edge spectra, N* = 3 Ecos2 0j (3) For LnI-edge spectra, N* = 0.7N~ + 0.9Ecos20j (4) Thus, when the polarization of the incident X-ray is normal to the surface (p-polarization), the X- ray absorber's neighbors which lie along lines parallel to the surface do not contribute to XAFS signals. These bonds are observable when s-polar- ized X-rays parallel to the surface are used. Con- versely, the bonds normal to the surface are detectable by p-polarized XAFS. The problem in applying conventional XAFS spectroscopy performed in a transmission mode to single crystal or flat amorphous samples is a low concentration of surface species. Although a fluorescent detection method of XAFS spectra can be used for dilute samples, the strong elastic scat- tering from the bulk hinders detection of the flu- orescence from the surface metal sites in a hard X-ray region, one way to enhance the signal to background ratio (S/B) is to use the total-reflec- tion method. When X-rays strike the sample with a glancing angle less than the critical angle, total- reflection of the incident X-ray occurs where the penetration depth of X-ray into the bulk is less than 3 nm and the elastic scattering X-ray from the bulk is remarkably reduced [9-12]. Thus, total-reflection fluorescence XAFS technique can be applied to surface species below monolayer [13,14]. In the present paper we report development of an instrument which makes it possible to carry out preparation in situ of samples and measurement in situ of polarized total-reflection fluorescence XAFS (PTRF-XAFS) under reaction conditions. In addition to the adjustment of total-reflection conditions, the sample orientation relative to the polarized X-ray can be variable in the PTRF- XAFS chamber without exposure to air. By using the PTRF-XAFS apparatus, we also report the characterization of metal and metal-oxide sites supported on single crystals in Cu2+/a-SiO2 (0001) [15], CoOx/a-A1203 (0001) [16--19], [Pt]Ja-A1203 (0001) [17], and V2Os/ZrO2 (100) [201. 2. In situ PTRF-XAFS chamber Design of the apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 1 [17,21]. Metallic and metal-oxide species are deposited on a flat substrate by metal evaporation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of metal- organic precursors. In order to prevent the depo- sition of the evaporated metals or metal organics on the Be windows, the chamber is separated into two parts by a gate valve. The sample is prepared in the upper part where an evaporation source and a quartz crystal thickness monitor are present. When XAFS spectra are measured, the sample is moved down to the lower part by a long flexible W.-J. Chun et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 5545 57 H I()[ K Fig. I.

The lower part has three Be windows (thick- ness: 25 /~m, purity: 99.8%, Electrofusion Cor- poration) for incident, reflected, and fluorescent X-rays. Be foils are fixed at the ports with a struc- ture adhesive material. The diameter of the Be windows for the fluorescent X-ray is 50 mm in diameter and it is possible to bring the Be window close to the sample with a linear motion drive. Thus, we can detect 50% of 4 sr of total-fluores- cence X-ray when the sample surface is set parallel to the fluorescence window. Reaction gases can be introduced into the chamber through a leak valve. We adopted the XYZ and rotary tables on which the whole chamber is mounted to adjust total- reflection conditions. The XYZ and rotary tables are driven by stepping motors controlled with a personal computer. The XYZ and rotary tables are composed of four parts. The top is a rotation table which can rotate with a precision of 0.02 mrad. The second one is a Z-table composed of three vertical jacks which are positioned in an equilat- eral triangle; one in the front and the other two at the back in Fig. 1. The sample center is put over the mass center of this triangle. The two bottom tables are X- and Y-tables. Total-reflection condi- tions for s-polarization with respect to the surface (E//surface) are adjusted by use of the three ver- 58 W.-J.

When the sample is tilted by the three vertical jacks, the X-table is moved by a calculated amount to set the X-ray beam to irra- diate the same position of the sample. The angle resolution for p-polarization is 0.02 mrad and that for s-polarization is also 0.02 mrad. The sample holder is fixed to a cylinder which is connected to two bearing rotors. The cylinder can be rotated by 100 deg and the sample orientation relative to the polarized X-ray can be altered from the parallel arrangement to the perpendicular one [ 21 ]. The sample can be heated up to 873 K from backside using a Ta resistive heating sheet. An a- A1203 sheet (7016X0.5 mm3 or 70)< 16X 1 mm3, purity: 99.8%, Degussa, Japan) is mounted between the sample and the Ta sheet which has a large thermal conductivity and at the same time is a good electric insulator. The temperature of the sample is measured by a thermocouple fixed to W.-J.

The sample can also be cooled to 100 K by liquid N2 which is flowed through a tube attached to the sample holder. The cooling of the sample is due to reduction of the Debye-Waller factor of EXAFS oscillation, if necessary. The PTRF-XAFS apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 3, where a photograph of the equipment is also shown. By using the PTRF-XAFS equipment, one can perform measurement in situ of the struc- tures of metallic and metal-oxide sites supported on flat inorganic support surfaces (single crystals or amorphous substrates) under a variety of treat- ment and reaction conditions. 3. PTRF-XAFS measurements Factory using a sagittal focussing Si ( 111 ) double crystal monochromator in the National Labora- tory for High Energy Physics (KEK-PF) as shown in Fig. 3 (Proposal No. 92-032, 92G-174, 89-146 and 90-142, and 85-011, respectively). Higher harmonics was removed by a total-reflec- tion mirror between the monochromator and the X-ray monitor. The incident and reflected X-ray beams on the sample surface were monitored by N2-filled ionization chambers. The fluorescent X- ray was detected by a NaI scintillation counter. The X-ray Bragg diffraction peaks form the crys- talline substrate could be removed by placing small pieces of Pb sheets, when necessary, in front of the window of a scintillation counter at a posi- tion where the Bragg diffraction begins to appear. Pt Lm-edge, V K-edge, Co K-edge and Cu K- edge XAFS spectra for the samples described below were measured at BL-TC, BL-7C, BL-14A, and BL-14A stations, respectively, of the Photon 4.

The cata- lytic performance of the samples is also reported. 4.1. Platinum clusters on ol-Al20~ (0001) Fig. 4 shows the Fourier transforms of k2- weighted EXAFS oscillations of the supported Pt4 clusters for s- and p-polarizations over the k region 30-90 nm-t [22]. The supported cluster sample was prepared by a drop-wise impregnation method using CH2C12 solution of Pt4 (CH3COO) 8 followed by evacuation for desiccation. In con- trast to the Fourier transform of the EXAFS data for Pt4(CH3COO)8 (Pt-Pt: 0.251 nm, Pt-O: 0.217 nm and 0.201 nm) which shows a Pt-Pt peak around 0.24 nm besides a Pt-O peak around 0.18 nm (phase shift uncorrected), no peak due to Pt-Pt bond was observed with both polariza- tions in Fig. 4. The EXAFS data clearly demon- strate that Pt-Pt bonding was cleaved upon supporting of the Pt4 cluster on the alumina [ 17]. On the other hand, Pt-O bonds were observed in s- and p-polarized EXAFS data and the coordi- nation number of the bonds was determined by a curve fitting method to be 3.5 and 3.2 for s- and p-polarization, respectively. From the model cal- culation based on the unreconstructed ce-A1203 (0001) surface structure, we can conclude that Pt atoms were located on the three-fold hollow sites composed of the topmost oxygen atoms of the surface. The sample was reduced with H2 at 393 K. The observed Pt Lm-edge XAFS spectra in both polar- izations are shown in Fig. 5. The Fourier trans- forms of k2-weighted EXAFS data are also shown in Fig. 5. A peak around 0.24 nm corresponding to Pt-Pt was observed more strongly in s-polari- zation than in p-polarization. The Pt-Pt bond dis- tance was determined to be 0.271 nm by the curve fitting analysis. Effective coordination numbers (N * ) were also determined as 6 and 3 for s- and p-polarizations, respectively. Although the abso- lute value of N* is hardly obtained because of the narrow k range available, the ratio of the Np to Ns in two polarized directions can give more reli- able estimation for the orientation of Pt clusters. The ratio Np/N~ is nearly 0.5, which suggests that Pt clusters must lie parallel to the ot-A1203 (0001) plane. We calculated the ratios Np/N~ assuming several Pt cluster models. If Pt clusters had a dou- ble-layer structure parallel to the substrate plane, the ratio would become as large as 0.9. If Pt clus- ters had a symmetric structure like sphere, the ratio would be 1.0, where there is no difference with s- and p-polarizations. Only one atomic-layer model, which gives the ratio to be 0.6, can explain the experimental value [22].

The surface structure transformations are illustrated in Fig. 6. 4.2. Copper oxide on a-quartz (0001) The samples were prepared as follows [15]. After an a-quartz (0001 ) substrate was treated at 393 K for 2 h in air, Cu(DPM)2 vapor (DPM: dipyvaloylmethanate) was deposited on the quartz surface for 4 h by CVD at 373 K for the vaporization and at 473 K for the deposition in a 0.201 n~ 0.267 nm 0.267 nm ~Cu Q 0 Fig. 7. Three possible sites for the location of Cu atoms on a-quartz (0001). flow of dried air (20 cm3/min). Then the sample was calcined at 673 K for 2 h. The treatment of the sample at 673 K may transform a-quartz (0001 ) to the/3-type at least at the surface layers, which has a more ordered structure. The ratio of Cu atom to surface oxygen atom on the quartz substrate was estimated to be 0.4 by an ICP anal- ysis of the solution sample obtained by leaching the Cu ions at the surface. The Fourier transform of s- and p-polarized EXAFS spectra showed one peak between 0.1- 0.2 nm which is straightforwardly assigned to Cu- O bond. The detailed analysis was conducted by a curve fitting method, demonstrating the exis- tence of Cu-O bonds at 0.201 nm. No Cu-Cu bonding was observed in both s- and p-polariza- tions, indicating that Cu atoms were supported on a-quartz (0001) in a monomer form [ 15]. The Ni* 's of Cu-O were determined to be 3.2 and 3.7 for s- and p-polarization, respectively, by the curve-fitting analysis (Np/N~ = 1.2). There are three possible locations of Cu atoms on the a- quartz (0001) ; that is, 'atop', 'bridge', and 'three- fold hollow' sites as shown in Fig. 7. The N~*'s for these arrangements can be calculated by Eqs. (5-7). The electric-field vector is N* / 3 = cos2a ( atop site) (5) N*/3 = 2 cos2a cos2fl + 2 sinZce sin2/3 cos2 ~b (bridge site) (6) N*/3 = 3 cos2a cos2/3 + 1.5 sin2a sin2/3 (three - fold hollow site) (7) 62 W.-J.

For the bridge sites, cos24, was integrated in every direction because of equivalent positions. For the atop sites, only the EXAFS oscillation for the bonds normal to the surface can be observed, while there is no oscillation parallel to the surface. Assuming the ideal surface structure with the O-O distance of 0.267 nm for the quartz [ 24] and using the Cu-O bond length (0.201 nm) deter- mined by the EXAFS analysis, we found the agreement of the experimental results only with the Cu atoms being located on the three-fold hol- low sites [ 15]. 2C -'- 1C . .6 2o \"0 E < b)\" 1 2 0 34 56 R / lO-lnm Fig. 8.

Cobalt oxides on a-Ale03 (0001) The samples were prepared by CVD using Co2(CO)8 as precursor which was deposited on a-A1203 (0001) for 2 h at room temperature, fol- lowed by evacuation at 313 K under vacuum to remove excess cobalt carbonyls (sample A). Then the sample (A) was exposed to 02 at 300 K for 5 h and further oxidized in air at 873 K for 1 h to form the spinel-like sample (B) [ 19]. Co2 (CO) 8 + ot-A1203 (0001 ) ---> CoOx/a-A1203 (0001) ( Sample A) [ CO304 ] n/ct-A1203 (0001 ) ( Sample B) It was found that the sample (B) showed an extremely high activity for CO oxidation at 273 K as compared to a usual impregnation Co304/ A1203 catalyst and to a Pt/AlzO3 catalyst [ 17,19 ]. The catalytic activity was so high that we could not follow the reaction rate. The sample (A) showed similar activity to that of the impregnation catalyst. The arrangement of surface oxygen atoms on surface is hexagonal [24]. Similarly to the case of Cu ions on a-quartz (0001), assuming an ideal surface with O-O distance of 0.275 nm and using the Co-O bond length of 0.208 nm determined by the EXAFS analysis, we compared the observed ratio Np/Ns to the calculated ones for the location models and concluded that Co atoms occupy the three-fold hollow sites far from A1 atoms on the alumina. Such a selective adsorption may be due to a repulsive Coulomb interaction between A1 atoms and Co atoms [ 19]. Oxidation of sample (A) at 873 K changed the EXAFS Fourier transform drastically, demon- strating the transformation of monomer structure to spinel structure in sample (B) as shown in Fig. 8. The Fourier transforms of the Co K-edge EXAFS data for the sample (B) in both polari- zations in Fig. 8 resemble that for Co304 bulk spinel. The bond distances for 1st shell (Co-O), 2nd shell (Co(oct)-Co(oct)), 3rd shell (Co(oct)-Co(tet) + Co(tet)--Co(tet)), and 4th shell (Co(oct)-Co(oct)) were determined to be 0.193, 0.286, 0.341, and 0.496 nm, respectively, by a curve fitting analysis [ 17-19]. However, the N/*' s of the second and third peaks in Fig. 8 were different with s- and p-polarizations, suggesting asymmetric growth of spinel structure on a-A1203 (0001 ). Therefore, we tried the calculation of the ratio Np/N~ in the second and third peaks for the several structural-model cases in which Co304 spinel (001), (110) and ( 111 ) planes grew par- allel to the substrate (0001) plane. In each case, two kinds of layers are placed alternately. For the (001) plane, one layer consists of oxygen atoms and octahedral Co atoms (model-001A) and the W.-J.

Co304 spinel structure in 0.9 nm dimension with the (001 ) plane parallel to ot-Al203 (0001 ) and an interface model (filled circles: Co atoms; shaded circles: O atoms of CO304 (001) plane; open circles: surface O atoms of ~-A1203 (0001) ). other layer consists of tetrahedral Co atoms (model-001B). In case of the (110) plane, one layer consists of oxygen atoms and tetrahedral and octahedral Co atoms (110A), and the other layers consists of octahedral Co atoms and oxygen atoms (ll0B). For the (111) plane one layer is com- posed of oxygen atoms and octahedral Co atoms (111A), and the other layer is composed of tet- rahedral Co atoms (111B). The expected ratios N~/N~ were calculated for different layer num- bers with these planes. It was found that the (001 A) model with seven layers well reproduced the observed data for sample (B) [ 19]. No other models fit the observed ratio. The spinel structure of Co oxide with seven layers on a-A1203 (0001) is illustrated in Fig. 9. The preferential growth of a close-packed (001) plane parallel to c~-A1203 (0001) surface may be due to the repulsion between the surface oxygen atoms of a-A1203 (0001) and the inter- face oxygen atoms of CO304 (001) being less than the repulsion for other planes. 4.4. Vanadium oxides on Zr02 (100) A Y203-stabilized ZrO2 (100) was calcined at 673 K for 2 h in air to remove volatile residual. The ZrOz (100) plane is a stable surface and its top layer is composed of oxygen atoms [25]. VO(OC2H5)3 was deposited on the ZrOz (100) by means of an impregnation method using an ethanol solution of VO (OC2H5) 3. The obtained samples were calcined at 823 K for 1 h in air. The 0.5 monolayer and 1.0 monolayer of vanadium oxide were supported on ZrO2 (100) surface, where a monolayer is defined to be the amount of V atoms equal to the amount of surface oxygen atoms. The sample was put into the PTRF-XAFS chamber and fixed on the sample holder above described for observation in situ of the PTRF- XANES. Before the PTRF-XANES measure- ment, the sample was heated at 373 K for 1 h in situ in vacuum. To study the dissociative adsorp- tion of V=O bonds with NH3, NH3 gas of 133 Pa was admitted to the sample at 423 K in the chamber. The XANES spectra of one-monolayer vana- dium oxides on ZrO2 (100) surface are shown in Fig. 10(a and b). The pre-edge peak (ls~3d transition) was observed at 5467 eV for both spec- tra in s- and p-polarizations. The presence of the strong pre-edge peak in XANES suggests that vanadium atoms are located in a tetrahedral sym- metry [26]. If the V205 (010) plane is exposed on ZrO2 (100), the pre-edge peak intensity of the p-polarized XANES spectrum would show max- imum and the intensity of the s-polarized one should show zero. In the XANES spectra of Fig. 10, the s-polarized pre-edge peak intensity was about half of the corresponding p-polarized 64 W.-J.

In situ polarized total-reflection fluorescence XANES spectra of 1.0 monolayer vanadium oxide on ZrO2 (100) in vacuum (a, b) and after NH3 adsorption for 30 min at 423 K (c, d) and for 2 h at 423 K (e, f). one. The angle between ZrO2 (100) surface and V=O bond direction is not 90 In the s-polariza- tion spectra, the peak intensity should be inte- grated by the term cosZ0 in every direction at the surface, where 0 is the angle between the V=O bonds and the polarized direction of the incident X-ray in surface plane. It means that the peak intensity of the s-polarization spectrum is half the peak intensity of the p-polarization spectrum if the angle between the V=O bond and the polarization vector is the same in s- and p-polarization. This result may be explained by the arrangement of the V--O bonds of vanadium oxides which are inclined to the ZrO2 (100) surface by about 45 [20]. The 45tilted V=O arrangement was observed with both the 0.5 and 1.0 monolayer vanadium oxides on ZrO2 (100). Upon NH3 adsorption at 423 K, the pre-edge peak intensities of both s- and p-polarization spec- tra decreased in a similar way and became zero. The decrease of the pre-edge peak intensity is referred to the structural change from V=O to V- OH by the reaction with NH3, where the vanadium oxide changes from tetrahedral structure to octa- hedral structure [20]. The similar decrease in the peak intensity of both polarizations may reflect a uniform orientation of the V--O bonds on ZrO2 (100). All of the tilted V=O bonds on ZrO2 (100) were active for the reaction with NH3 at 423 K as shown in Fig. 10 [20]. References [1] Y. lwasawa, Catal. Today, 18 (1993) 21. [2] Y. Iwasawa, Adv.

Fax: (+81-3)58006892 A chamber for observation in situ of polarized total-reflection fluorescence extended X-ray absorption fine structure (PTRF-XAFS) spectra was constructed, which makes it possible to measure the PTRF-XAFS spectra in situ under preparation, treatment, and reaction conditions from high vacuum (1 × 10−9 Pa) to high pressure (1 × 105 Pa) and from low temperature (100 K) to high temperature (800 K). The PTRF-XAFS technique can provide information on asymmetric or anisotropic structure of active metal and metal-oxide sites supported on single crystal substrates as models for supported catalysts, by measuring bondings of supported species in two or three different directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface independently.
