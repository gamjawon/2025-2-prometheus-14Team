Graphical abstract The tetraarylphosphonium supported chiral imidazolidinone catalyzes the enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of nitrones and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to provide isoxazolidine aldehydes in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Most importantly, the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone catalyst can be readily recovered and recycled for further transformations at least four cycles without observing significant decrease in yield and stereoselectivity. Keywords Tetraarylphosphonium Imidazolidinone 1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions Recyclable Organocatalyst 1 Introduction In the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of organocatalysts in asymmetric synthesis [1–5]. Among them, MacMillan's imidazolidinone catalyst has emerged as one of the most efficient organocatalysts for a variety of highly enantioselective reactions involving α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [6–10]. However, the recovery and recycling of the catalyst are still the issues that need to be addressed in this area. To solve this problem, recently several modified methods which allowed the recycling of the imidazolidinone catalyst by immobilizing MacMillan's catalyst onto ionic liquid, polymer, fluorous tag, or silica gel have been developed [11–24]. In a preliminary communication, we have reported the immobilization of chiral imidazolidinones on tetraarylphosphonium salts to afford the supported catalysts 1a–c (Fig. 1 ) for the enantioselective Diels–Alder reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with dienes [25]. In continuation of our efforts in exploring the synthetic utility of the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone in organic synthesis as well as developing practical organic transformations, herein we describe the extended application of the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone catalyst 1a–c to the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with nitrones. 2 Experimental 2.1 General remarks Reactions were monitored by TLC using precoated plates of silica gel HF254 (0.5mm, Yantai, China). Column chromatography was performed with a silicagel column (200–300 mesh, Yantai, China). NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity Inova 600 spectrometer (1H at 600MHz and 13C at 150MHz) or WIPM 400 spectrometer (1H at 400MHz and 13C at 100MHz). IR spectra were recorded on an IR-spectrum one (PE) spectrometer. HPLC were performed with Dionex UltiMate 3000 and equipped with a chiral column (Chiralcel OJ-RH, Daicel) using CH3OH/H2O as an eluent. A UV detector (UVD-3000) was used for the peak detection. 2.2 General procedure for the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions To a solution of the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone catalyst 1a (438mg, 0.6mmol) in CH3NO2 (30mL) and H2O (27μL) was added HBF4 (40μL, 0.6mmol) and N-benzyl-C-phenyl nitrone (633mg, 3mmol). After cooling the solution to 0°C, E-crotonaldehyde (2.5mL, 30mmol) was added, and then the mixture was stirred for 36h at this temperature. The resulting solution was then evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in the minimum amount of CH2Cl2 (2mL) and poured in Et2O (25mL), and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane/EtOAc, 50:1, v/v) to afford the desired products, in which the endo/exo ratio was determined by 1H NMR. The precipitate in the sand-core funnel was dried under vacuum and reused in further reactions as the recovered catalyst. The recovered catalyst was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which showed unchanged after each recovery.

Then we sought to establish optimal reaction conditions that would furnish the isoxazolidine aldehyde products 2 and 3 in good yield and excellent enantioselectivity. As illustrated in Table 1 , the choice of solvent is found to have a significant impact on the outcome of the reaction, not only in terms of yield, but also involve the enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 1–8). The reactions were carried out in the presence of 20mol% 1a/HBF4 combinations in different solvent system at 4–25°C for 24h. Among the solvents examined, CH3NO2/H2O provided the best result (entry 8, 82% yield, 94/6 endo/exo, endo 88% ee). Therefore, CH3NO2/H2O was chosen as the solvent system to further optimize the reaction conditions by screening different acids as reaction co-catalysts. Seven types of protic acids were screened as the reaction co-catalysts (Table 1, entries 8–14). Among the protic acids examined, it was found that better endo/exo selectivities (94/6, 91/9, 93/7) were obtained when HBF4, HClO4 and HPF6 used as reaction co-catalysts (entries 8, 12 and 13). In contrast, relatively high yield and excellent endo ee were produced when HBF4 was selected (entry 8, 82% and 88%). Thus, HBF4 was chosen as the optimal reaction co-catalyst in further reactions. Next, the effects of reaction temperature and time, universally crucial factors, in the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was investigated (Table 1, entries 8, 15–19). It is manifest that 0°C and 36h is the best temperature and time for the reaction, which resulted in 89% yield, 94/6 endo/exo and 94% endo ee. Furthermore, the influence of the catalyst loading in the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was also examined under the condition of 0°C for 36h (Table 1, entries 17, 22 and 23). The best amount of catalyst used was 20mol%, as higher or lower catalyst loadings seemed to be detrimental either for yield or stereoselectivity. So the optimal reaction condition of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with 1a as catalyst is CH3NO2/H2O as solvent system, HBF4 as co-catalyst, 0°C for 36h and 20mol% catalyst amount. With the optimized reaction condition in hand, the tetraarylphosphonium supported chiral imidazolidin-4-ones 1b and 1c were also evaluated for the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to compare with the use of 1a (entries 20 and 21). The chemical yields by the use of the catalysts 1b and 1c were comparable to 1a, but the diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity were lower. So the catalyst 1a is the best one among them. Overall, the target products 2 and 3 were obtained in 89% yield, 94/6 endo/exo and 94% endo ee by 1a, which is comparable to the result obtained from the use of non-supported imidazolidinone [10]. For instance, the same excellent endo enantioselectivity of 94% was obtained by employing either Macmillan's imidazolidinone catalyst or the tetraaryphosphonium supported catalyst. 3.2 Recycling and reuse of catalyst 1a Isolation of the products by simple precipitation and filtration was quite easy when using the tetraaryphosphonium supported chiral imidazolidinone catalyst. Catalyst recycling experiments could also be readily performed. As shown in Table 1 (entries 17, 24–26), no significant decrease in catalytic activity is observed when the tetraaryphosphonium supported catalyst 1a was recovered and reused in further reactions. Excellent diastereoselectivity (90/10) and enantioselectivity (92% endo ee) of the corresponding products were obtained even in the 4th cycle, making catalyst 1a synthetically efficient and useful (entry 26). 3.3 Scope of catalyst 1a The scope of the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions between α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and various nitrones catalyzed by 1a was investigated (Table 2 ). The reaction appears quite general with respect to the nitrone structure (entries 1–5, 72–88% yield, 90/10 to 94/6 endo/exo, 85–97% endo ee). Changes in the structure of the dipolarophile were also well tolerated; E-crotonaldehyde, E-2-hexenal and acrolein provided isoxazolidine aldehydes in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (entries 1, 6 and 7). 4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have developed an efficient method for the enantioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions by using the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone catalyst, providing the desired products in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. It is worth mentioning that the tetraarylphosphonium supported imidazolidinone catalyst can be readily recovered and recycled for further transformations at least four cycles without observing significant decrease in yield and stereoselectivity.
