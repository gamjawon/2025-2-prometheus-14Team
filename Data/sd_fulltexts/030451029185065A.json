P. Lau*, C. Y. Ren, M. T. Chu and C. H. Yeung Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic, Hung Horn, Kowloon (Hong Kong) (Received February 13, 1990; accepted October 19, 1990) Abstract Ru3(CO)i2/phosphine and Ru3(CO)ia/phosphite are effective catalytic systems for the selective hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated aldehydes. Selectivity varies with the P/ Ru:3(CO)i2 ratio. With a low P/Ru3(CO)i2 ratio of one, the olefinic functions of the a,ss- unsaturated aldehydes are preferentially reduced; increasing the ratio leads to the selective hydrogenation of the carbonyl groups, giving the a,/3-unsaturated alcohols as the pre- dominant products. Introduction Selective reduction of o;,ss-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been attracting much interest for some time [1]. While catalytic hydrogenation of u',/3-unsaturated aldehydes to give saturated aldehydes is readily achieved using both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems [2], highly selective hydrogenation to yield the unsaturated alcohols has been less frequently reported [3]. Recently we reported that RusCCCOig/phosphine or /phosphite systems are very active in catalyzing the linear dimerization of methyl acrylate and cyclotrimerization of methyl propiolate [4]. We have become interested in studying other catalytic activities of these systems. Here we present the results of our work aimed at utilizing these Ru3(CO)i2/phosphine or /phosphite systems for the homogeneous selective hydrogenation of o;,ss-unsaturated aldehydes (eqn. 1).

But addition of phosphine or phosphite generates very effective catalytic systems for the reaction (Tables 1 and 2). Selectivity of the hydrogenation reaction depends on the P/Ru3(CO)i2 ratio. In all runs with P/Ru3(CO)i2 ratio equal to one (except run 6, Table 2), the carbon-carbon double bond is more rapidly reduced to give the saturated aldehyde as the major product. On increasing the P/Ru3(CO)i2 ratio, reduction of the olefinic function is suppressed, and the carbonyl group is selectively reduced to yield the unsaturated alcohol as the predominant product. Similar dependency of selectivity on the phos- phine/complex ratio was also observed in the indium phosphine systems [3c]. The influence of reaction temperature on the activity of the Ru3(CO)ia/ 15 PPha system in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was studied. At temperatures below 90 C, yields of products were low, but at 90 C there was a dramatic increase in catalytic activity. Further increase in temperature led to gradual improvement of the total conversion. The optimal temperature was found to be 110 C. The sudden increase in activity at 90 C seems to indicate that the cluster may have undergone transformation at this temperature to generate the active species. Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl is known to react with hydrogen at 110 C and 150 atm [5] or in refluxing n-octane at atmospheric pressure [6] to yield the dodecacarbonyl tetrahydrido tetra- ruthenium(I), H4Ru4(CO)i2. This tetranuclear cluster and some of its phosphine- substituted derivatives such as H4Ru4(CO)i2-j/(PPh3)y (t/=2-4); H4Ru4(CO)8(PBun3)4 and H4Ru4(CO)3[(-)-DIOP]2 were found to be active hydrogenation catalysts. After the hydrogenation of cyclohexanone with H4Ru4(CO)iz at 160 C and 100 atm H2, the ruthenium cluster was recovered TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde\" Run Catalytic system % Conversion1' Unsat.

We suspect that under our reaction conditions, H4Ru4(CO)i2 or its phosphine or phosphite derivatives may have first been formed and act as active catalyst(s) or catalytic precursor(s) for the selective hydrogenation of the a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes. As a comparison with Ru3(CO)i2/15PPh3 (run 5, Table 2), the catalytic activity of H4Ru4(CO)i2/20PPh3 (run 10, Table 2) m the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was studied. It was found that under identical reaction conditions, the tetranuclear cluster phosphine system was far less active than Ru3(CO)i2/15PPh.3. An overall conversion of 15% was achieved, while the yield of the unsaturated alcohol was only 10%. Also, the color of the solution mixture after the hydrogenation reaction was golden yellow, which was quite different from the orange color of the Ru3(CO)ia/ loPPhs system. The tetraphosphine-substituted derivative of dodecacarbonyl tetrahydrido tetrarutheiuum(T), H4Ru4(CO)g(PBu\"3)4, which can be easily prepared by reacting H4Ru4(CO)ia with excess PBu\"3 at elevated temperature, is an active catalyst for the selective reduction of 0',/3-unsaturated aldehydes to a.ss-unsaturated alcohols m a hydrogen transfer reaction [8]. The activity of this cluster for the selective reduction of cinnamaldehyde in hydrogenation reaction has been studied, and the result of this reaction (run 11, Table 2) is compared with that of the reaction catalyzed by Ru3(CO)i2/18PBu\"3 (run 3, Table 2). It is found that the activity of H4Ru4(CO)8(PBu\"3)4 is slightly lower than that of Ru3(CO)i2/18PBu3.

'Based on cinnamaldehyde used. 290 were removed after catalysis, and extraction of the oily residues with hexane gave an orange-yellow solution for the H4Ru4(CO)3CPBu\"g)4 system, while a yellow solution was obtained in the case of RuaCCCOia/lSPBuV Infrared measurements of both solutions show strong absorptions in the terminal carbonyl region, however the positions and appearance of the absorptions in the two spectra are very different. The spectrum of the H4Ru4CCO)8CPBu\"3)4 system gives eight sharp and well resolved peaks, but that of Ru3(CO)i2/ 18PBu\"3 consists of three relatively sharp peaks and a very broad one. It is obvious that much more work is needed in order to determine the active species in the two catalyst systems. The catalytic activities of carbonyl-free ruthenium complexes have also been studied. It was found that RuCIs SHaO/SPPha (run 12, Table 2) is more active towards the reduction of the oleunic function than the carbonyl group. But pretreatment of RuCla-SHgO with Zn/MeOH m the presence of PPhg generates an active system which shows high selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to give cinnamal alcohol as the major product. Zinc and alcohol have been used for many years in the reduction of transition metal salts. Reaction of RuClg SHgO with Zn/MeOH m the presence of PPhg probably generates a ruthenium phosphine complex in a lower oxidation state. Studies with RuCIa SHgO indicate that carbonyl-free ruthenium phosphine complexes can be very active catalysts for selective hydrogenation of 0',/3-unsaturated aldehydes, and these complexes certainly deserve further investigations. The effect of hydrogen pressure on activity was studied using the Ru3(CO)i2/15PPh3 system and with cinnamaldehyde as the substrate. It was found that under atmospheric pressure of Hg, a total conversion of only 4% was achieved. At 10 atm, conversion jumped to 72% and at 30 atm or above, the total conversion was basically constant at ~85%. Experimental Reagent grade toluene and mesitylene were distilled over sodium ben- zophenone under nitrogen. Cinnamaldehyde (Merck) was vacuum distilled and crotonaldehyde (Merck) was distilled before use. Triphenylphosphine (Aldrich) was recrystallized from ethanol, tributylphosphine (Aldrich) was distilled under vacuum before use. High purity hydrogen (Hong Kong Oxygen) was used directly. Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl and ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate were obtained commercially (Aldrich) and were used directly; H4Ru4(CO)i2 [6] and H4Ru4(CO)s(PBu\"3)4 [5] were prepared by reported procedures. Hydrogenation reaction All reactions were carried out in a 100 ml stainless steel autoclave. In a typical run, 25 mg of the ruthenium complex, 20 ml solvent, 3 ml substrate and the appropriate amount of phosphine or phosphite were mixed in the autoclave. After flushing with Hg two or three times, the system was heated 291 at 110 C under 30 atm of hydrogen. At the end of the desired time, the reactor was cooled rapidly and the reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography on a Perkin Elmer Sigma 3B apparatus equipped with a FID. A 25 m x 0.32 mm OV-1 capillary column was used for the hydrogenation products of cinnamaldehyde and a 50 m X 0.32 mm OV-17 capillary column was used for that of crotonaldehyde.
