State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering Beijing University of Chemical Technology Beijing 100029 PR China Graphical abstract For efficient oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of fuel oils with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), a poly(ionic liquid)s based nano core-shell catalyst SiO2@V-PIL was prepared by reacting poly vinylimidazole (PVIM) with peroxovanadic acid on nano-particles of SiO2. The structure and composition of SiO2@V-PIL, V-PIL/SiO2 and V-PIL were studied through TEM, SEM, XRD and other methods. Compared to micron-sized V-PIL and V-PIL/SiO2, the core-shell Nano catalyst can significantly enhance the oxidation rate of the sulfides. The catalytic difference may arise from their specific surface exposure and active center distribution. Dibenzothiophene (DBT) can be oxidized completely within 60 min under appropriate conditions, and 99 % of catalytic performance can be retained after 5 recycled uses. The Nano core-shell structuring might be used as a viable and universal way to significantly upgrade the catalytic activity of the composite catalysts.

Presently, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is widely used in industry [4,5], which needs harsh conditions and is confronted with great challenges to meet the ever-upgrading standard of ultra-low fuel oils [6]. Oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is a feasible alternative deep desulfurization approaches for its mild operation conditions, and low capital and running cost [7–12]. Regarding the oxidants for the ODS process, H2O2 is used widely due to its cheapness, easy accessibility, and greenness of the resultant byproduct of H2O [13,14]. To enhance the oil-water heterogeneous reaction, extractive oxidative desulfurization (EODS) has attracted much attention [15,16]. The mass ratio of extractant to oil is about 20 %–50 %, which may reduce the productivity, and introduce cross contamination. From a sustainable point of view, non-aqueous oxidant is a better choice [17]. O2 and O3 are green radical oxidant [18–21], but their reactivity is low, since the free radical transfer in oil is much lower than that in water and acetonitrile. For aerobic ODS process, the development of efficient catalysts is crucial. For this, Li and Zhu et al. has done a series of work, and found some excellent catalysts, e.g. Pt/h-BN [22] and ionic liquid based catalyst [C4VIM]5PMo10V2O40 [23]. These ODS processes usually need longer reaction time, say 5 h to achieve 99 % removal of DBT from model oil. In contrast, the oleophilic oxidant like cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is more viable for its homogeneous reaction nature [17]. But the byproduct of TBHP is too volatile to be compatible with diesel oil. In contrast, CHP is a cheap and bulk chemical [24], and its byproduct will not deteriorate the oil quality, because 2-phenyl-2-propanol may be used as an oil component with high value of octane number. Poly(ionic liquid)s, PILs, refer to a subclass of polyelectrolytes or ionic polymers connected through an ionic polymeric backbone [25–28], which poses some unique properties of ionic liquids [29], e.g. the polar environment for organic reactions. Further, porous PILs show higher surface area and porosity, designable spatial architecture and mechanical stability [30–32]. The PILs-based catalysts were usually made in amorphous micron form, e.g. the micron-sized PILs-based catalysts HPW-PIL and V-PIL for fuel oil ODS [17,33]. But Nano-sized PILs catalysts with core-shell structure was seldom reported, which may greatly enhance the specific area, optimize the active center distribution, and improve the catalysis of the composite catalysts [34–36]. Besides, using cheap SiO2 nanosphere as the core helps to enhance the usability of the key catalyst and reduce the overall cost. Herein, we designed and prepared a Nano core-shell SiO2@V-PIL catalyst, and identified their structure via various characterization methods. An ultrafast ODS process was developed by using SiO2@V-PIL catalyst and CHP oxidant, and the optimal reaction condition was explored. The as-prepared SiO2@V-PIL shows a higher specific surface, better exposure of the catalytic active sites, and thus better catalysis than V-PIL/SiO2 and V-PIL. DBT can be oxidized completely within 60 min, and 99 % of catalytic performance can be retained after 5 recycled uses. The core-shell Nano structure was proved to be a general method to significantly enhance the catalysis of PILs-based catalysts. 2 Experimental section All chemicals were used without further treatment. The PVIM and V-PIL were prepared following the method described elsewhere [17], and their structure was referred to the same reference. SiO2 nanosphere was prepared as follows. 40 mL of ammonia, 80 mL of deionized water, and 40 mL of ethanol were mixed in a flask, marked as solution A. 20 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of TEOS were mixed in a flask, and marked as solution B. Solution B was added dropwise into solution A, and then kept stirring for 8 h at room temperature. Finally, the SiO2 nanosphere was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, and reserved after drying at 353 K under reduced pressure. To prepare SiO2@V-PIL, CTAB was firstly dissolved in 200 mL ethanol solution of 0.5 g PVIM, marked as solution C, to which the as-prepared SiO2 nanosphere was added and ultrasonically treated for 30 min. 0.5 g V2O5 was added in 50 mL deionized water with 2 mL 30 wt.% H2O2, and stirred 30 min to get transparent peroxovanadic acid solution, noted as solution D. Then, solution D was added dropwise into solution C, and kept stirring for 4 h at room temperature. Finally, the core-shell structured SiO2@V-PIL Nano catalyst was achieved after separating, washing and drying. And the catalyst with 70 wt.% of V-PIL dopant amount was named SiO2@V-PIL-70. The ODS experiments were similar to our published work [3]. For a typical experiment, 30 g of model oil with 500 ppm S, and a certain amount of CHP and SiO2@V-PIL catalyst were mixed and treated ultrasonically for 2 min, and then stirred magnetically at specified temperature. After ODS, 1 mL of oil sample was taken out and its DBT content was measured triply by HPLC. [3] The HPLC was recorded by a Shimadzu 10A-VP with UV–vis detector and C-18 column using 1 mL/min mobile phase (Vmethanol/Vwater = 9/1), and the test wavelength of DBT and other S-compounds are 310 nm and 260 nm, respectively. The real diesel was obtained by adding specified amount of DBT to a colorless transparent oil being pretreated with anhydrous AlCl3 in advance, and its total S-content was measured by a S-N analyzer. The XRD patterns, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and TEM images were recorded by the methods as described elsewhere [3]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst structure and characteristics The pristine particles of the SiO2 are about 20 nm, being agglomerated loosely, as shown from the TEM images in Fig. S1. The as-prepared SiO2@V-PIL is much more spherical (Fig. 1 a,b) than the nanosized SiO2 precursor, with about 300 nm in diameter. As shown from the XRD patterns (Fig. 1c), the uncalcined SiO2 is virtually amorphous. The refraction peaks of V2O5 in SiO2@V-PIL, V-PIL/SiO2 and V-PIL are virtually disappeared due to its vanishing crystal structure, and transformation to various polyoxovanadate species via hydrolysis and peroxidation [37,38]. Here, the formation of core-shell structure is driven by a special acid-base interaction, or self-assembly process. In fact, as an anhydride of polysilicic acid, there exists abundant acidic hydroxyl groups on the surface of SiO2 particles. The dissolved PVIM, as a moderate base, will favorably adsorbed and hocked on the surface of SiO2 via acid-base interaction, forming a thin alkaline film of PVIM. When peroxy-vanadic acid solution is added slowly to the above suspension, it will favorably approach to the surface of SiO2 due to the strong acid-base affinity, and in situ form the V-PIL film instantly with high cross-linkage, ionicity and porosity [39]. Besides, the N atom of PVIM can also complex with polyoxovanadate with multiple coordination sites [40,41], forming coordinated cross-linkage. In short, the nanospheres of SiO2 act as the cores for the core-shell structure formation via sequential specific acid-base interactions among SiO2, PVIM, and peroxy-vanadic acid. As shown in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 1d), absorption bands of water impurity appear at 1619–1639 and 3414−3446 cm−1 for PVIM, V-PIL and SiO2@V-PIL. The characteristic peaks of PVIM at 1500, 1230 and 1285 cm−1 are assigned to stretching vibration of imidazole ring(CC and CN), CH and CN (ring), respectively. [42] Some characteristic peaks of PVIM disappear in the SiO2@V-PIL, V-PIL/SiO2 and V-PIL due to its protonation by polyoxovanadic acid. [40] And for SiO2@V-PIL, V-PIL/SiO2 and SiO2, the absorption band at 1000–1100 cm−1 is characteristic for the stretching vibration of SiO. Fig. 2 shows the TEM, TEM-EDX and TEM-mapping of the catalysts. The core-shell structure of SiO2 @ V-PIL is justified clearly by the TEM and TEM-EDX results (Fig. 2 a–c), where Si and O elements are distributed in the core of 350 nm, and C, N and V are distributed in the outer shell of about 50 nm. For clarity, the distribution of all elements was provided separately in Fig S2. As such, the catalytic active sites (peroxovanadate) are uniformly exposed on the surface of the SiO2 particles. In contrast, the catalytic active sites of V-PIL/SiO2, a physical slurry mixture of V-PIL and nano SiO2 particles, are distributed randomly (Fig. 2d). The V-PIL/SiO2 is a micron-sized amorphous precipitate (Fig. 2e), and the constituent components are distributed randomly and separated clearly (Fig. 2f). Similarly, V-PIL is a porous aggregates (Fig. 2 g,h) with amorphous structure. 3.2 ODS kinetics study As shown in Fig. 3 , the ODS process follows a pseudo first-order kinetic model. The catalyst structure, temperature, catalyst amount, and V-PIL doping amount have notable influence on the ODS rate. The rate constant is increased greatly from 0.0225 min−1 to 0.0585 min−1 with the increasing V-PIL ratio in SiO2@V-PIL catalyst (Fig. 3a). The rate constants of SiO2@V-PIL, V-PIL/SiO2 and V-PIL are 0.0225 min−1, 0.00864 min−1 and 0.00288 min−1, respectively, under fixed V-PIL usage and the same other conditions. The catalytic activity of SiO2@V-PIL is roughly threefold that of V-PIL/SiO2, and an order of magnitude higher than the neat V-PIL. The results suggest that the core-shell structure of the catalysts is crucial, which helps to form a Nano-scale spherical catalyst with much smaller aggregate size and higher specific surface area, higher accessibility of the catalytic sites, and faster mass transfer for the ODS reaction. In comparison with other vanadate-based catalysts, SiO2@V-PIL has higher ODS performance for DBT model oil, as shown as Table S1. 3.3 Other influence factors for the catalytic oxidation of DBT Neat SiO2 nanoparticles show negligible catalytic activity (Fig. 4 a). They just provide cores for the gradual formation of core-shell catalyst SiO2@V-PIL. The catalytic activity of SiO2@V-PIL increases with the increasing dopant amount of V-PIL(Fig. 4a), e.g., the desulfurization ratio at 120 min is increased from 76 % to 100 % as V-PIL increased from 30 wt.% to 70 wt.%. Note worthily, the catalytic activity of SiO2@V-PIL is much superior to the highly crosslinked amorphous V-PIL as manifested by its higher desulfurization ratio at specified conditions and lower V-PL usage. This highlights the determinant role of the core-shell structure on the catalytic activity of SiO2@V-PIL. Thus, SiO2@V-PIL-70 with 70 wt.% of V-PIL content is used hereinafter. The oxidation rate of DBT increases with the increasing catalyst usage(Fig. 4b), and the desulfurization ratio at 90 min increases drastically from 48 % to 98 % as SiO2@V-PIL-70 usage increased from 0.3 g to 0.9 g. However, 0.6 g catalyst may be a feasible usage considering the marginal enhancing effect thereafter and negative effect for the catalytic decomposition of CHP oxidant. The oxidant usage has a profound influence on operating cost and ODS rate. The desulfurization rate at 90 min increases drastically from 40 % to 100 % as the mole ratio of CHP/DBT (O/S, in mole ratio) increases from 2 to 8(Fig. 5 a). Note that at stoichiometric ratio of O/S = 2, only 40 % of desulfurization can be achieved, due to the catalytic decomposition of CHP, and excessive amount of oxidant is necessary to achieve a deep desulfurization. For the present ODS system, temperature has marginal influence on the desulfurization ratio (Fig. 5b), and the desulfurization rate only increases slightly with temperature from 50 to 80 °C. This suggests that the reaction can be carried out under mild conditions, and the heterogeneous reaction rate is mainly dependent on the concentration of catalytic sites and their accessibility or usability. Thus, the core-shell structured SiO2@V-PIL is much superior to its bulk porous precursor V-PIL. The oxidation rate of different thiophenic sulfurs follows the order DBT > 4,6-DMDBT > BT (Fig. 6 a), which is common for all ODS processes and opposite to their HDS reactivity. Further, DBT in real diesel can also be oxidized completely within 3 h under mild conditions. To evaluate the applicability of the catalyst SiO2@V-PIL for other oxidants, comparative experiments were done for H2O2 and O2 under fixed other conditions. As shown in Fig. 6b, the ODS performance of CHP is much better than other oxidants, which suggests that SiO2@V-PIL catalyst is specific to CHP oxidant, and nearly ineffective for H2O2 and O2. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the desulfurization rate remains 99.5 % after 5 cycles reuses without any treatment for the catalyst SiO2@V-PIL, indicating excellent reusability and negligible loss of catalysis. This result is also supported by the fact that the XRD patterns of SiO2@V-PIL were virtually unchanged after five recycled uses. The excellent catalytic activity and reusability highlight the potential application of the present ODS process with CHP oxidant and core-shell catalyst SiO2@V-PIL. 4 Conclusion We have designed and prepared a poly(ionic liquid)s based core-shell nano catalyst SiO2@V-PIL by using SiO2 nano particles as the hard core and highly cross-linked V-PIL as the porous shell with 50 nm thickness. The catalytic activity of SiO2@V-PIL is much higher than the corresponding physical mixture V-PIL/SiO2 and the neat porous V-PIL for the ODS process with CHP as oxidant. The core-shell structure played a dominant role in dispersing the catalytic sites uniformly on the surface of SiO2, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the active sites and promoting the mass transfer, and thus increasing the specific catalysis. The present ODS system is effective and efficient for the removal of thiophenic sulfurs in oil, and 99 % desulfurization ratio is achievable for DBT in real diesel within 90 min under mild conditions. The structuring of a core-shell catalyst may be a viable way for greatly improving the catalytic activity of other PILs based catalysts.
