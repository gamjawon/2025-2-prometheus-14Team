Graphical abstract Lamellar WSSe grown in situ on peanut shell-derived carbon (PSDC/WSSe) is elaborately designed as a highly stable SIB anode with a fast kinetic. WS2, a two-dimensional layered material, is promising as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anode due to its large interlamellar spacing and high sodium storage capacity. However, its low electronic conductivity and high Na+ adsorption energy hinder reaction kinetics. Here we demonstrate that substituting Se for part of the S in WS2 reduces interlayer Na+ adsorption and increases electronic conductivity. Based on this finding, lamellar WSSe, grown in situ on peanut shell-derived carbon (PSDC/WSSe), is elaborately designed as a highly stable SIB anode with a fast kinetic. PSDC/WSSe with carbon matrix and Se substitution simultaneously provides fast electron transport channels and lowered Na+ transport barriers (0.22 eV). The PSDC/WSSe anode offers a considerable reversible sodium storage capacity (288.0 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1) and a fast kinetic reaction. A SIB full-cell using a PSDC/WSSe anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode achieves a 215.4 Wh kg−1 high energy density, and successfully powers LEDs. This work offers new strategies to lower sodium ion transportation barrier in two-dimensional layered materials. Keywords Sodium-ion batteries Two-dimensional materials WSSe WS2 Peanut shell-derived carbon 1 Introduction Due to their abundant sodium reserves and high safety (capable of discharging to 0 V), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gaining increasing prominence and are progressively being utilized in electric power systems [1–3]. Compared to the thriving development of cathode and electrolyte materials, the exploitation of advanced anode materials for SIBs, which is equally important, is still in its infancy [4–6]. To date, only hard carbon (HC) anodes have been used commercially, but they are limited by unsatisfactory sodium storage capacities (the majority less than 300 mAh g−1) [7,8]. Therefore, a priority target for the industrialization of SIBs is the development of advanced anodes [9,10]. Na+ ions have a larger radius than Li+ ions (1.02 Å of Na+ vs. 0.76 Å of Li+), meaning that their diffusion kinetics in the anode material are more sluggish. The insertion/de-insertion of Na+ ions during charging/discharging process is accompanied by dramatic volume variations in the anodes, which in turn causes stress accumulation that can damage the structural integrity of the active material and shorten the cycling lifespan of the electrodes [6]. Numerous promising anode materials, such as carbon materials, metal oxides/sulfides, alloys, etc., have been extensively reported [5]. Among them, tungsten disulfide (WS2), a classic member of the transition metal sulfides (TMSs) family, features relatively large interlayer spacing (∼6.2 Å) and labile van der Waals interactions across the S–W–S layers. Such graphite-like structure facilitates higher Na+ storage (432 mAh g−1 theoretical sodium storage capacity) through embedding processes [11]. Therefore, WS2 is highlighted as a promising candidate for investigation as a suitable host for Na+ [12]. However, the large adsorption energy of Na+ in the S–W–S interlayer increases the transport barrier of Na+ within the crystal, significantly reducing the kinetic properties of SIBs [13]. Moreover, the inadequate conductivity of the WS2 anode results in elevated charge transfer resistance and diminished ion diffusion coefficients, causing considerable capacity loss and structural degradation [14]. Various strategies, including nanosizing [15], atom doping [16], and composite carbonaceous materials [17], have been exploited to address the above issues. For example, a carbon-coated WS2 nanotubes (NTs-WS2@C) composite was reported to enhance its sodium storage properties by combining nanosized and carbon materials and provided a sodium storage capacity of 115 mAh g−1 at a current density of 600 mA g−1 [7]. Moreover, a nickel-doped WS2 composite with a multidimensional migration channel structure was employed as an anode for SIBs, exhibiting a sodium storage capacity of ∼250 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and only cycling <150 cycles [10]. Although the above strategies can effectively enhance the sodium storage behavior of WS2, the cycling stability and lifespan of WS2 at high current density are still unsatisfactory. Additionally, the interaction mechanism of Na+ ions in the S–W–S interlayer and its sodium storage kinetics remain ambiguous. Therefore, simultaneously improving the cycling stability and kinetic behavior of WS2 anodes at high current densities (>1 A g−1) remains a significant challenge. Here, we justify that replacing S–W–S with S–W–Se can significantly reduce the transport barrier of Na+ between the layers (from 0.39 eV to 0.22 eV in Fig. 1 a and Figs S1, S2). When Na+ is inserted into the interlayer, the electrons tend to exhibit more active properties in S–W–Se than in S–W–S (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3), which is beneficial in accelerating electronic transport. Based on this finding, lamellar WSSe, grown in situ on peanut shell-derived carbon (PSDC/WSSe), is elaborately designed as a highly stable SIB anode with a fast kinetic (Fig. S4). PSDC/WSSe with carbon matrix and Se substitution simultaneously provides fast electron transport channels and lowered Na+ transport barriers. The PSDC/WSSe anode displays an outstanding capacity of 288.0 mAh g−1 through 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 and fast kinetic behavior. When combined with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes, as-coupled SIBs full-cell ensures a superior energy density of 215.4 Wh kg−1, which illuminates the light-emitting diodes (LEDs). 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemical reagent WCl6, (AR: 99.9%), Se powder (AR: ≥99.99%), C2H5NS (AR: 99%), and C3H7NO (AR: 99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai McLean Biochemical Technology Co. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Notably, all reagents are used directly without further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of PSDC Peanut shells from nature are thoroughly washed with deionized water to remove their surface dirt, then dried and ground into a powder. The dried peanut-shell powder was placed into an alumina crucible and heated to 300 °C under an Ar atmosphere at an elevated rate of 2 °C min−1 for 2 h. Subsequently, it was heated from 300 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h, and finally cooled naturally to room temperature to obtain the peanut shell-derived carbon (PSDC). 2.3 Synthesis of PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe A homogeneous mixture was prepared by combining 0.10 g of PSDC, 2 mmol of WCl6 (0.79 g), 20 mmol of C2H5NS (1.50 g), and 30 mL of C3H7NO. The obtained turbid liquid reacted at 180 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the products were washed alternately with ethanol and deionized water more than three times and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The PSDC/WS2 powder was obtained. The dried PSDC/WS2 powder and Se powder were placed separately in a mass ratio of 4:1, wherein the Se powder was placed at the air inlet. Then, the samples were heated to 800 °C under a mixed Ar/H2 (95:5) atmosphere for 5 h at a rate of 5 °C min−1, and naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain PSDC/WSSe nanosheet composites. 2.4 Material characterisation The morphological features and lattice information of PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe were probed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Regulus 8100) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The crystallographic information, phase composition, and chemical state of the material were determined by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD, Miniflex 600Smart Lab 9 kW), Raman spectroscopy (Raman, Renishaw-invia, Excitation wavelength: 532 nm), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+). Brunauer–Emmett–Tellern (BET, ASAP 2460) tests were used to analyze the specific surface area and pore size of the materials based on N2 isothermal adsorption and desorption. The weight ratio between WSSe and carbon materials was explored by using thermogravimetric analysis (TG, Rigaku TG-DTA8122). Electron paramagnetic resonance devices (EPR, Bruker EMX PLUS) were utilized to determine the structural properties of the samples. 2.5 Electrode preparation A homogeneous slurry was formed by dissolving 80 wt% of anode active mass (PSDC/WSSe, PSDC/WS2, and PSDC), 10 wt% Super P, and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP, AR, >99.0%), followed by milling. Subsequently, the slurry was uniformly coated onto the copper (Cu) foil a scraper, and vacuum dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The dried Cu foil was tailored into 10 mm diameter discs, in which the active mass was controlled to be ∼1.5 mg cm−2. The preparation of the NVP cathode is similar to that of the PSDC/WSSe anode, except that the active material is NVP powder, and the collector is aluminum (Al) foil. Notably, the active mass loading of the cathode and anode is controlled precisely by controlling the height of the scraper. 2.6 Electrochemical testing The CR2032 type coin cell was assembled by employing PSDC/WSSe (PSDC/WS2 or PSDC) as cathode, Na metal as an anode, Whatman glass fibre (GF/D) as a separator, and 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in dimethyl ether (DME) as electrolyte, respectively. The assembly process was conducted in a glove box filled with Ar (<0.1 ppm H2O and O2). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were evaluated using an CHI760E electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles and rate performance of SIB half-cells were performed on a LAND-CT2011A battery test system with the voltage range set to 0.01–3.0 V. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test was conducted at 0.1 A g−1 activated for 5 cycles, followed by a test at 0.05 A g−1 with a discharge time of 10 min and a relaxation time of 2 h. The SIB full-cell is assembled similarly to the half-cell, employing NVP as the cathode, PSDC/WSSe as the anode, GF/D as a separator, and 1 M NaPF6 in DME as the electrolyte, respectively. The negative/positive (N/P) ratio was set as 1.2. The capacity of the full-cell is highly dependent on the cathode, anode, and electrolyte system, calculated by the NVP cathode. The SIB full-cells were evaluated in the voltages ranging of 1.5–3.8 V. 2.7 Theoretical calculation All the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The exchange–correlation function was treated by the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (GGA-PBE) functional. The plane wave cutoff energies were set to 500 eV. The DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme was adopted to describe the van der Waals interactions. The structure optimization was based on an energy tolerance of 1 × 10−6 eV and a force tolerance of 0.02 eV Å−1. The structure of double-layer WS2 and WSSe was constructed by a 3 × 3 supercell with a 15 Å vacuum space to prevent interactions between adjacent surfaces. The Brillouin zones were sampled with a k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method was used to evaluate the transition state and activation energy for one Na atom migrating from one hollow site in WS2 and WSSe to another hollow site. The corresponding adsorption energy (ΔE a) for sodium ions is calculated by adding a single Na+ in each model and then relaxing the optimized geometry structures again, according to Eq. (1). (1) Δ E a = E tot - E Na - E str where E tot is the total energy of the compound, E Na is the energy per atom in pure Na metal, and E str is the energy of each structure. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Material design We have simulated the migration barriers of Na+ in WS2 and WSSe, respectively (Fig. 1a and Figs S1, S2). When part of the S in WS2 is replaced by Se, WSSe exhibits a low Na+ migration barrier of 0.22 eV. Compared to S atoms, Se atoms have a larger radius, which is beneficial for broadening the interlayer distances of WS2 and reducing the adsorption of Na+ by S atoms [18]. Additionally, we inserted a Na+ in the lamellar structures WS2 and WSSe, respectively, to clarify the charge distribution (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3). Compared to WS2, Na+ shows superior electron transport in WSSe. DFT calculations demonstrate that the conversion of S–W–S to S–W–Se simultaneously reduces the Na+ transport barrier and enhances the electronic conductivity. Based on the above studies, we elaborately designed a PSDC matrix to grow in situ WSSe nanosheets (PSDC/WSSe), which is further employed as a SIB anode to stably store Na+ (Fig. S5). The S:Se ratio in the PSDC/WSSe can be identified as ∼1:1 (Fig. 1d and Fig. S6). PSDC with superior electrical conductivity significantly avoids nanomaterial agglomeration and increases electronic conductivity [19]. Moreover, sufficient space between the WSSe nanosheets can promote electrolyte penetration and accommodate the volume change of the material (Figs. S7–S9). Notably, the atomic structure of WS2 is altered through the selenization process (Fig. 1c). The selenated WSSe exhibits a large interlayer distance of ∼7.36 Å, which is higher than that reported for WS2 (6.2 Å) [11], and thus can advantageously store Na+ (Fig. S10). To explore the defect structure of PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were conducted (Fig. S12). Compared to PSDC/WS2, PSDC/WSSe exhibits a stronger EPR signal (g = 2.003) [20], suggesting that the replacement of S in WS2 by Se creates abundant anionic defects, which increases its reactive sites and electrical properties, thereby promoting rapid carrier transport. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy techniques were employed to detect the crystalline information and composition of the sample. The different diffraction peaks in PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe indicate the successful replacement of part of S by Se (Fig. S13). The composition and bonding energy of the PSDC/WSSe can be probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). W, S, Se, and C element were detected in PSDC/WSSe (Fig. S16), which is consistent with their SEM element mapping (Fig. S11). In the W 4f refined spectrum (Fig. 1e), two sharp peaks presented at 31.6 eV and 33.7 eV are related to the chemical environments of 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W4+ [17], respectively, while the peak observed at 32.1 eV is contributed by the WC bond, which corresponds to the CW bond in the refined spectra of C 1s. The introduction of Se changes the electron distribution within the material, especially the electronegativity and valence electron structure differences between W and the surrounding elements. This enhances the interaction between W and C atoms. In addition, Se-induced lattice defects or dislocations provide additional active sites that contribute to the formation of WC bonds, resulting in a more stable structure between the WSSe nanosheets and PSDC. Compared with PSDC/WS2, W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 characteristic peaks within PSDC/WSSe are shifted towards lower binding energies (∼0.30 eV), which is caused by the S atoms being partially replaced by Se atoms, resulting in decreased WS bond energy. The S 2p characteristic peaks of PSDC/WSSe showed a negative shift due to the doping of Se atoms (161.9/163.1 eV shifted to 161.6/162.8 eV in Fig. 1f). The fine spectra of Se 3p (160.4 and166.1 eV) and Se 3d (54.9 and 55.7 eV) show Se signals, indicating the successful Se seeding in PSDC/WSSe (Fig. 1f and Fig. S16c) [21]. 3.2 Electrochemical cycling To evaluate the superiority of the PSDC/WSSe, SIB half-cells were assembled. Fig. 2 a depicts the CV curve of PSDC/WSSe under a sweep speed of 0.2 mV s−1. A pair of reduction peaks is discernible at 0.60 and 0.36 V in the initial cathodic scan, indicating that Na+ entered the PSDC/WSSe and yielded the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A sharp oxidation peak (1.80 V) and an inconspicuous peak (2.11 V) are detected in the first anodic scan, showing that a conversion reaction and Na+ detachment had occurred [22]. In the second cathodic scan, the electrode showed two reduction peaks at 1.44 and 0.85 V, indicating that a reversible conversion reaction occurred. Subsequently, the CV profiles of the second and third scans exhibited a high degree of overlap, indicating that PSDC/WSSe displays excellent electrochemical stability. The voltage plateau in the GCD curve of PSDC/WSSe matches the redox peak of the CV curve (Fig. 2b). The discharge curve shows the presence of a pair of peaks at 1.50 V and 0.85 V, which correspond with reduction peaks. In turn, the plateaus observed in the charge curve at 1.39 and 1.71 V are attributed to oxidation peaks. Besides, PSDC/WSSe with 84.64% ICE displayed a ∼679.0 mAh g−1 capacity, which was higher than PSDC/WS2 (77.99%) and PSDC (58.06%) and far exceeded that of commercial HC (typically <350 mAh g−1). This is ascribed to the incorporation of selenium atoms, which augment the layer spacing of WS2 and facilitate the embedding and delocalization of sodium ions, thereby reducing the irreversible capacity loss. Concurrently, the introduction of selenium atoms enhances the overall electrical conductivity of the material, thereby reducing resistive loss during the initial charge/discharge cycle and improving the ICE. Fig. 2c shows the Na+ storage stability of PSDC, PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe for 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Although the capacity of PSDC/WSSe still decays in the first 20 cycles due to the irreversible sodium loss that accompanies the first charge/discharge process, such as electrolyte decomposition to form the solid electrolyte interfacial phase (SEI) layer. While the formation of the SEI layer gradually stabilizes the system, it nevertheless results in the consumption of some sodium ions and electrolyte. However, PSDC/WSSe shows superior cycling stability and Na+ storage capacity in comparison to PSDC and PSDC/WS2. Following 100 cycles, PSDC/ WSSe was observed to have a specific capacity of ∼356.0 mAh g−1, while PSDC/WS2 and PSDC are only 242.9 and 164.0 mAh g−1, respectively. Fig. 2d shows PSDC, PSDC/WS2, and PSDC/WSSe electrodes rate performance at 0.05–2.0 A g−1. Compared to PSDC/WS2 and PSDC, PSDC/WSSe presents excellent Na+ storage capacity and recoverability. Even when confronted with a shock of 2.0 A g−1 high current density, PSDC/WSSe demonstrates a sustained capacity of 226.1 mAh g−1, whereas PSDC/WS2 and PSDC have only 129.1 and 83.9 mAh g−1. The GCD curves of PSDC/WSSe with various current densities are shown in Fig. 2e. Similar charging and discharging platforms demonstrated that Na+ undergoes stable conversion reactions in the PSDC/WSSe structure. To evaluate the endurance of the PSDC/WSSe, the material was examined at 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 2f). PSDC/WSSe presents exceptional longevity and high capacity. After 1000 cycles, PSDC/WSSe can be retained a capacity of 288.0 mAh g−1, which is superior to PSDC/WS2 (197.5 mAh g−1) and PSDC (113.6 mAh g−1). In comparison to previous research on WS2 (or WSe2)-based anodes, our work shows considerable competitiveness (Fig. 2g) [23–30]. 3.3 SEI detection We attributed these stable cycles to the morphological advantages and the generated favorable SEI enriched with inorganic components. Fig. 3 a is a SEM image of PSDC/WSSe after 1000 cycles. PSDC/WSSe can maintain the nanosheet morphology integrity, indicating its ability to withstand high current densities. Following the cycling process, analysis revealed a homogeneous distribution of C, W, Se, S, and Na elements in PSDC/WSSe (Fig. 3b), illustrating that its structure remains intact and can store Na+. To probe the Na+ diffusion capacity of the samples after cycling, we evaluated the impedance information of PSDC, PSDC/WS2, and PSDC/WSSe after 1000 cycles (Fig. 3c). Compared to PSDC, PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe have small semicircular diameters, indicating that WS2 or WSSe construction significantly reduces the Na+ embedding barrier. After Se-doped, PSDC/WSSe exhibits a smaller electrochemical impedance and faster Na+ transport than PSDC/WS2. As a bridge connecting the electrolyte to the anode, the properties of the SEI, such as composition, homogeneity, and thickness, greatly influence the cell kinetics [31]. Fig. 3d shows the interfacial morphology of PSDC/WSSe after cycling. A uniform SEI layer of about 7.5 nm thick is observed, which is conducive to the homogeneous passage of the Na+ flux. Stabilized generation of SEI can effectively inhibit the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte [32]. Meanwhile, a thin SEI reduces the excessive depletion of Na+ in the electrolyte, thus improving the ICE of PSDC/WSSe [33]. Additionally, the composition and content information of SEI were examined using XPS deep etching. Fig. 3e shows the C 1s, O 1s, and F 1s refinement spectra of PSDC/WSSe after cycling at different etching depths. Prior to sputtering (0 nm), the C 1s peaks situated at 284.8 eV, 287.1 eV, 288.1 eV, and 289.4 eV are attributed to CC/CH, CS, CO, and CO3, respectively, while the O 1s peaks at 531.5 eV, 536.6 eV are attributed to CO and Na KLL. Besides, the O 1s peak at 531.5 eV is analyzed as NaO, and the F 1s peaks at 684.5 eV and 687.7 eV are Na–F and PF. The detected bonds can be well-matched to Na2CO3, Na2O, and NaF [34,35]. Therefore, SEI with predominantly inorganic components were generated on the PSDC/WSSe surface after cycling. With increasing sputtering depth (10 nm and 20 nm), the organic content of the SEI on the PSDC/WSSe anode progressively decreases and, in turn, the inorganic material gradually increases, especially NaF (Fig. 3f). The inorganic component-rich SEI promotes the uniform distribution of the Na+ flux and improves the interfacial stability, thereby increasing the cycling stability and durability of the PSDC/WSSe anodes [36,37]. 3.4 Kinetic analysis The kinetic performance of the SIB was analyzed through capacitive and diffusive behavior. The CV curves of the PSDC/WSSe at scan rates from 0.4 to 2.0 mV s−1 are illustrated in Fig. 4 a. The similar profiles of the CV at various speeds indicate that similar conversion reactions occur, justifying the structural stability of PSDC/WSSe. To clarify whether the electrode material is controlled by diffusive or pseudocapacitive behavior, the peak values were calculated at various scan rates. The following equation is used to relate peak values to scan rates. (2) i = a ν b (3) log i = b log ν + log a In the equations, the symbol i is the peak current (mA), the variable ν denotes the voltage sweep rate (mV s−1), and the constants a and b are obtained from experiments. In theory, a and b-value of approximately 0.50 suggests that the electrode material is diffusion-dominated for sodium storage, while a and b-value of ∼1 exhibits pseudocapacitor-controlled sodium storage [38]. The values of the b-value for the oxidation and reduction peaks are 0.51 and 0.55 (Fig. S21a), respectively, meaning that PSDC/WSSe is affected by a combination of diffusion and pseudocapacitance. A scan rate of 2.0 mV s−1 was employed to calculate the pseudocapacitance contribution, which was found to constitute 56% of the total charge (Fig. S21b). The pseudocapacitance contribution primarily arises from the increased layer spacing and surface adsorption of the PSDC/WSSe, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. The pseudocapacitance dominance of PSDC/WSSe increases incrementally as the scan rate rises, with pseudocapacitance contributions of 36%, 46%, 52%, 54%, and 56% at 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.6, and 2.0 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 4b). The pseudocapacitive behavior facilitates accelerated sodium ion transport and enhances the cell reaction kinetics. To investigate the SIB reaction barrier, we performed Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests. Fig. 4c is the EIS curves of PSDC, PSDC/WS2, and PSDC/WSSe. It consists of a circular portion in the upper frequency range and a linear portion in the lower frequency range. The higher frequency range is governed by the charge transfer process, whereas the lower frequency range is largely influenced the diffusion of reactants or products of the electrode reaction. This reflects the interfacial charge transport resistance and the Warburg diffusion impedance of the electrode, respectively [39]. The impedance values of PSDC (246.0 Ω) and PSDC/WS2 (96.8 Ω) are higher than those of PSDC/WSSe (25.6 Ω) (Fig. S22). The low interfacial impedance of PSDC/WSSe indicates that the Na+ transport barrier is tremendously lowered at the interface and the bulk phase, which is ascribed a result of the formation both of a thin, stabilized inorganic-rich SEI and the introduction of Se atoms to improve the electronic conductivity. An illustrative equation exemplifying the nexus among the Warburg coefficient (σ w), the Na+ diffusion coefficient (D Na +), and other relevant variables is provided below. (4) W o = R s + R ct + σ w ω - 1 / 2 (5) D Na + = R 2 T 2 2 S 2 n 4 F 4 C 2 σ w 2 In the equation, the terms R, T, S, n, F, and C represent the following: the gas constant, the room temperature, the surface area of the active mass, electrons number, the Faraday constant, and the Na+ concentration in the electrode, respectively. The slope connecting Z′ and ω −1/2 in the lower frequency range represents σ w, where a smaller σ w indicates a larger D Na +. The PSDC/WSSe has the lowest slope in comparison to both the PSDC and PSDC/WS2, indicating that it has the fastest Na+ transport (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the D Na + of electrode material is refined by utilizing the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Fig. 4e, f show the GITT profiles of PSDC/WS2 and PSDC/WSSe, and their corresponding D Na +. During the discharge process, the D Na + of PSDC/WSSe is 2.61 × 10−11–1.78 × 10−12, while the D Na + of PSDC/WS2 is 1.71 × 10−11–1.80 × 10−13. Compared to PSDC/WS2, the sodium ion diffusion coefficient in PSDC/WSSe is observed to be higher, indicating that the expanded interlayer spacing and increased active sites have a positive impact on the Na+ transport capacity. The fast SIB kinetics have been attributed to the following reasons (Fig. 4g): (1) the PSDC acts as a carbon substrate providing fast electron transport channels; (2) WSSe nanosheets facilitate rapid electrolyte entry channels and Na+ contact sites; (3) Se doping enhances the electron transport within the bulk phase. 3.5 Assessment of practical application To gauge the potential of PSDC/WSSe for practical applications, an NVP cathode and a PSDC/WSSe anode were employed to couple the SIB full-cell. NVP cathodes were characterized and electrochemically evaluated in Figs S32–34. Fig. 5 a describes the mechanism of the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell’s charging and discharging operations. In the charging process, Na+ are detached from the cathode of the NVP, passed to the anode side in the electrolyte, where they enter the PSDC/WSSe for the conversion reaction. Concurrently, electrons enter the anode by way of an external circuit. Notably, the discharge process is the opposite of the charging process. Fig. 5b depicts the GCD curves for the Na|NVP half-cell, the Na|PSDC/WSSe half-cell, and the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell. The Na|NVP and Na|PSDC/WSSe half-cells can be operated at high (2.7–3.8 V) and low (0.01–3.0 V) voltages, respectively, enabling the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell to have a suitable supply voltage range from 1.5 V to 3.8 V. Fig. 5c is the CV curves of the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell at 0.2 mV s−1. The four peaks identified at 2.54, 3.77, 3.04, and 3.36 V are observed to exhibit a correlation with the insertion of Na+ into the PSDC/WSSe anode and SEI formation. Conversely, the peak identified at 3.51 V is linked to the extraction of Na+ from NVP cathode, which corresponds to the CV curve of NVP (Fig. S35) [40]. In the outset of the anodic scan, the peak detected at 3.29 V is Na+ detachment from the PSDC/WSSe anode and insertion into the NVP cathode. Subsequently, the CV scans of the second and third experiments exhibited a high degree of overlap, indicating that the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell has superior electrochemical stability. Fig. 5d exhibits PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell cyclic performance at 0.5 A g−1. The reversible capacity was found to be 100 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating that PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell has excellent Na+ storage capacity. The PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell with ∼99% stable CE exhibits superior cycling stability. The PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell displayed a high sodium storage capacity in the initial cycles, which is mainly attributed to the fact that the anode side captures many Na+ from the electrolyte. Subsequently, the sodium storage capacity of the PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cell is determined by the reversible Na+ in the battery system. To demonstrate the commercial utilization potential of PSDC/WSSe, we employ two PSDC/WSSe|NVP full-cells to light up a decorative lamp consisting of LEDs (Fig. 5e). 4 Conclusions In this study, we employed DFT calculations to verify the replacement of S–W–S by S–W–Se in WS2, which can dramatically reduce the Na+ adsorption energy barriers in its interlayers from 0.39 eV to 0.22 eV. When simulating Na+ insertion into the intercalation, electrons tend to show more favorable electron transport capacity in S–W–Se than in S–W–S. Moreover, PSDC/WSSe was carefully designed to perform as a SIB anode, which minimized Na+ transport resistance and maximum electron transport capacity. Electrochemically, The PSDC/WSSe anode was cyclized for one thousand cycles at 1.0 A g−1, showing a superior sodium storage capacity of 288.0 mAh g−1 and fast kinetic behavior. The coupled PSDC/WSSe|NVP SIB full-cell shows superior energy density (215.4 Wh kg−1) and is capable of stably servicing 100 cycles. Additionally, it can successfully light up the LEDs, demonstrating excellent real-world application potential. This work provides novel solutions for the design of two-dimensional layered materials with enhanced electronic conductivity and reduced ion transport energy barriers.

        "dc:description": "WS2, a two-dimensional layered material, is promising as sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anode due to its large interlamellar spacing and high sodium storage capacity. However, its low electronic conductivity and high Na+ adsorption energy hinder reaction kinetics. Here we demonstrate that substituting Se for part of the S in WS2 reduces interlayer Na+ adsorption and increases electronic conductivity. Based on this finding, lamellar WSSe, grown in situ on peanut shell-derived carbon (PSDC/WSSe), is elaborately designed as a highly stable SIB anode with a fast kinetic. PSDC/WSSe with carbon matrix and Se substitution simultaneously provides fast electron transport channels and lowered Na+ transport barriers (0.22 eV). The PSDC/WSSe anode offers a considerable reversible sodium storage capacity (288.0 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1) and a fast kinetic reaction. A SIB full-cell using a PSDC/WSSe anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode achieves a 215.4 Wh kg−1 high energy density, and successfully powers LEDs. This work offers new strategies to lower sodium ion transportation barrier in two-dimensional layered materials.",
