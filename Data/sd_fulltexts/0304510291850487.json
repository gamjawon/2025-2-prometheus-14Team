A. Cabello, J. M. Campelo*, A. Garcia, D. Luna and J. M. Marinas Organic Chemistry Department, Cordoba University, E-14004 Cordoba (Spain) (Received June 18, 1990; revised February 4, 1991) Abstract The liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of benzylidene ketones, in the p-XCBH4CH=CHCOR form (E isomers; X=H, Me, MeO, Cl; R=Me, Et, n-Pr, i-Pr, t-Bu, n-Pe, Ph) was carried out using a sepiolite-supported rhodium catalyst (1 wt.% Rh) in methanol solvent under low hydrogen pressure (0.55 MPa) and at room temperature (298 K). The reactions were selective with respect to the formation of the conjugate reduction product (p-XCBH4CHZCHZCOR) although a very slight amount of benzyl ketone (hydrogenolysis of the C-Cl bond) is found in p-chlorobenzylidene ketones. The influence of both X and R substituents was analyzed by the Pavelich-Taft equation and both conjugative and steric effects of X and R groups were found to simultaneously influence the reaction process. A cis-concerted mechanism, including a transition state with some partially developed charge, is assumed for the hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones over Rh/ sepiolite catalysts. Here, the concerted character of the hydrogenation is considered as a reaction taking place in a single step on a rhodium surface site with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation. Introduction The catalytic hydrogenation of polyfunctional molecules is interesting in many respects. Hydrogenation is the main application of heterogeneous catalysis in organic chemistry and in the industrial production of the so-called` `fine chemicals'. The selectivity of the catalyst towards different functional groups furnishes valuable information about the catalyst itself, and the successive steps of the reaction mechanism. In recent papers, we have shown that 1 wt.% Rh/sepiolites are highly selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of the double bond of olefins bearing a variety of organic functions [ 1-8], with neither C-N nor C-O bond hydrogenolysis, and without carbonyl group hydrogenation. Only allyl alcohols yielded the side reaction product corresponding to the isomerization of the double bond to form carbonyl compounds [3, 6] and, in the case of cinnamyl alcohols, the hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bond, yielding 1-phenylpropene and n-propylbenzene, is also found [8]. On the other hand, the influence of the olefinic substrate structure on reactivity is of great interest with respect to the mechanistic study of alkene 0304-5l02O1/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 218 hydrogenation on supported metal catalysts [9, 10]. Thus, previous results with respect to the chemoselective hydrogenation of p-substituted benzylidene ketones on Rh/AlP04 catalyst have shown that the reaction process is influenced by the simultaneous action of both enthalpic (coijugative) and steric effects of the p-substituent as well as by the resonance (coWugative) contribution of the COR group onto the olefinic bond [5]. Taking into account that in a previous paper Rh/sepiolite catalysts exhibited higher hydrogenation rates (per gram of supported rhodium) than Rh/AlP04 and Rh/AIP04-Si02 catalysts and that natural sepiolite fibrous clay is a support less expensive and more easily available than AIP04 or AlP04--SiOz, we have studied the behaviour of the olefinic substrate on Rh/sepiolite catalysts. Thus, in the present paper we examined the liquid-phase chemoselective hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon double bond of several E-benzylidene ketones by using a rhodium (1 wt.%) catalyst supported on a natural Spanish sepiolite clay support that was calcined for 3 h at 573 K [ 11 ] previous to rhodium impregnation. The sepiolite thus treated retained its fibrous morphology, which is also maintained after rhodium impregnation and reduction due to the mild experimental conditions used in the preparation of the supported rhodium catalyst. Experimental General methods Infrared spectra were obtained on a FT-IR Bomem MB-100 spectrophotometer. 'H NMR spectra were obtained on a Brucker (200 MHz) instrument. Mass spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 5992 instrument. GLC analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 instrument equipped with a stainless-steel column (1 m long and 0.3 mm o.d.) packed with 1090 U.C. on Chromosorb W 60/80. Peak areas were measured by a HewlettPackard HP3396A electronic digital integrator. Materials All E-benzylidene ketones were prepared through Claisen-Schmidt condensation by reacting the corresponding aldehydes with several methyl alkyl ketones, using activated barium hydroxide as the catalyst according to a procedure previously described [ 12 ]. They were purified by either double distillation or recrystallization before use, and the purity was verified by GLC and 'H NMR. Methanol, used as the hydrogenation solvent, was spectroscopic grade and used without further purification. Catalyst The sepiolite, originally from Vallecas-Madrid (Spain), was provided by Tolsa S.A. The chemical analysis of the natural parent sepiolite (85 wt.%) 219 was Si02 62.0ss'o; Mg0 23.9%; A1203 1.7%; Fe203 0.5%; Ca0 0.5ss'o; K20 0.6% and Na20 0.3%; weight loss from 293 to 1273 K, 10.590. These oxides are part of the clay structure; none of them is free. The presence of smectite, quartz and dolomite as significant impurities was detected. This sepiolite support, designated Pansil (PS), was calcined at 573 K for 3 h in a muffle furnace and stored in a desiccator (SBET=197 m2 g-') previous to rhodium impregnation. The rhodium supported on sepiolite catalyst was prepared by impregnation of the calcined sepiolite with an aqueous solution of RhC13 - 3H20 (Merck, p.a.), to yield a nominal 1 wt.% Rh, using the incipient wetness method. The slurry was stirred for 24 h, the water was then evaporated in a rotary vacuum evaporator and the solid was dried at 393 K for 24 h and stored in a desiccator. The impregnated support was reduced in flowing hydrogen (100 ml m -n-', 99.99990, HZO < 3 ppm) at 473 K for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature maintaining the same hydrogen stream. The sepiolitesupported rhodium catalyst was freshly prepared previous to any benzylidene ketone hydrogenation run. Hydrogenation apparatus and general procedure All experiments were conducted with a Parr Instrument 3911 hydrogenator at an initial hydrogen pressure of 0.55 MPa and at 298 K. The temperature was controlled by pumping water from a thermostatic bath through the vessel jacket, with a precision of 0.5 K. The compound to be reduced (5 mmol) and methanol (50 ml) were placed in the hydrogenation vessel (250 ml) and then the freshly reduced catalyst (200 mg) was added. The vessel was connected to the hydrogenator, flushed twice with hydrogen, pressurized at 0.55 MPa, and shaken until absorption of 1 equiv of hydrogen. The progress of hydrogenation was then followed by recording the hydrogen uptake vs. time, at constant volume. Catalytic activity is determined as the initial rate of hydrogenation, from the slope of the linear hydrogen pressure decrease vs. reaction time, remaining linear up to 60ss'o--7Oss6 conversion. After filtration and elimination of methanol by rotary vacuum evaporation, the hydrogenation products were purified by crystallization or silica column chromatography and were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic properties ('H NMR and FT-IR spectra) with those described in the literature [5]. Results and discussion Diffusion control and reaction kinetics The hydrogenation reactions were carried out under conditions in which overall reaction rates were not influenced by diffusion. Thus, the effect of the external diffusion was checked by lowering the shaking regime from 300 220 to 100 min-'. The hydrogenation rates were independent of the agitation speed above 200 min-'. In addition, to avoid the potential interference of internal diffusion, the catalyst was sieved down to 0.149 mm, thereby excluding the possible influence of hydrogen diffusion on the hydrogenation rate. Internal diffusion was found to operate when the particle size was greater than 0.21 mm. Furthermore, the hydrogen uptake rate, r, in the hydrogenation of Ebenzylideneacetone was found to be linearly related to the weight, w, of the catalyst used. The plot of r-' vs. w-' was also linear, and from the inverse of the interception at origin [ 13 ], a hydrogen transfer rate higher than (30-50 orders of magnitude) any hydrogenation rate was obtained. Thus, we conclude that the kinetic data, in the range of the operating variables, are free from transport influences. Under the present reaction conditions at 298 K, the hydrogenation rates for all substrates studied were first order in initial hydrogen pressure (0.4-0.7 MPa) and zero order in the concentration of E-benzylidene ketone (0.1-3.0 M). These results could be accounted for by assuming a strong adsorption of the substrate on the catalyst surface, which seemed to be almost completely covered by it, while hydrogen was weakly adsorbed and its surface coverage low. Thus, the bond formation between substrate and rhodium metal site must precede hydrogen activation, this being the rate-determining step, as is generally accepted in these cases [14-16]. Therefore, the effect of the substrate structure on the hydrogenation rate must be interpreted in terms of the stability of the rhodium-olefin species. Thus, hydrogenation could be assumed to be proportional to the rate at which hydrogen reaches the available rhodium active sites. Accordingly, the kinetic equation for the hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones on the Rh/sepiolite catalyst can be written as: r= do /dt =k -pHZ where pHz is the initial hydrogen pressure and k the reaction rate constant. On the other hand, our previous work involving the liquid-phase hydrogenation of numerous olefins bearing different functional groups in the a position [1-8] and different alcohols as solvents showed that the protic character of the alcohol plays an important role. Thus, the highest reaction rates were obtained with methanol and for this reason it was used for the hydrogenations described here. Because the reaction rate increases with the protic character of the alcoholic solvent, it can be concluded that the process takes place through intermediates with some polar character and that the solvent is able to assist this separation of charge in the transition state. Hydrogenation reaction rates To determine the hydrogenation activity of the 1 wt.% Rh/sepiolite catalyst, the initial rates of hydrogenation, ro, were obtained from the slopes 221 of the initially linear hydrogen-decrease vs. reaction-time curves. The results for all substrates studied, based on at least three repeated measurements of the hydrogenation run (6-8ss'o error), are collected in Table 1. In all cases, the conjugate reduction products were obtained with total selectivity, and no unsaturated or saturated alcohols were detected. Only very slight amounts of benzyl ketones were obtained when p-chlorobenzylidene ketones were hydrogenated, but these were never higher than 4 wt.% of the hydrogenation product. Moreover, variations in initial rates for Rh/sepiolite catalyst samples derived from independent impregnations and/or initial reductions were not TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones over Rh/sepiolite (1 wt.% Rh) catalyst p-X-CBH4CH=CHCOR ro x 10' r8 (mol min') (mol min-' g\"-') X R H Me 3.72 0.19 H Et 3.17 0.16 H n-Pr 2.99 0.15 H i-Pr 2.96 0.15 H n-Bu 3.47 0.17 H t-Bu 1.98 0.10 H n-Pe 3.18 0.16 H Ph 1.51 0.08 C1 Me 5.61 0.28 C1 Et 5.38 0.27 Cl n-Pr 4.24 0.21 C1 i-Pr 4.42 0.22 Cl n-Bu 4.63 0.23 Cl t-Bu 3.42 0.17 Cl n-Pe 4.92 0.25 Ci Ph 1.96 0.10 Me0 Me 5.13 0.26 Me0 Et 4.82 0.24 Meo n-Pr 3.46 0.17 Meo i-Pr 4.44 0.22 Meo n-Bu 3.44 0.17 MeO t-Bu 2.69 0.13 MeO n-Pe 3.31 0.16 Me0 Ph 1.66 0.08 Me Me 5.39 0.27 Me Et 4.92 0.25 Me n-Pr 4.46 0.22 Me i-Pr 4.25 0.21 Me n-Bu 4.92 0.25 Me t-Bu 2.94 0.15 Me n-Pe 3.48 0.17 Me Ph 1.76 0.09 222 observed either. Thus the Rh/sepiolite catalyst is very promising for selective hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds and, in addition, the reactions may be carried out easily and rapidly. The work-up is reduced to a mere filtration and evaporation of the solvent. Also, Rh/sepiolite catalysts may be used several times without loss of catalytic activity. In this context, a series of reactions was carried out with E-benzylideneacetone and the catalyst preserved almost 10090 initial activity for another batch of substrate after the former sample had been completely converted into saturated ketone. Table 2 lists the results, illustrating that no loss of catalytic activity is seen after . six successive uses. On the other hand, from Table 1 it can be seen that the hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones is sensitive to the substituents in the carbonyl group, indicating a 1,4-adsorption state with subsequent isomerization of enol. Moreover, the rate decreases when sterically hindered E-benzylidene ketones were hydrogenated. This again suggests that the adsorption of substrate on the rhodium surface site takes place prior to hydrogen activation, and can be interpreted in terms of stability and reactivity of the rhodium-olefin species [ 14 ]. Efect of the nature of X and R on the hydrogenation rate The influence of structure on reactivity is a topic of current interest in the study of the mechanism of alkene hydrogenation on supported metal catalysts in order to ascertain how the polar and/or steric effects of the substituent modify the adsorptivity of the unsaturated compound or the reactivity of the adsorbed species [9, 10]. Moreover, the determination of the influence that substituents exert on the rate of a reaction is usually discussed within the context of the linear free-energy relationship (LEER), the Hammett, Taft and Pavelich-Taft equations [ 17-19 J which are the most frequently used in organic chemistry. Thus, we have studied the role of X and R groups on the reactivity of E-benzylidene ketone hydrogenation on the Rh/sepiolite catalyst by applying the Pavelich-Taft equation, that jointly includes the polar and steric effects, TABLE 2 Recyclability of Rh/sepiolite catalyst in the hydrogenation of E-benzylideneacetone' Run ra x 10' (mol min-') initial run (fresh catalyst) 3.72 1st recycle 3.70 2nd recycle 3.80 3rd recycle 3.65 4th recycle 3.70 5th recycle 3.67 '5 mmol E-benzylideneacetone in 50 ml of methanol at 298 K, 300 min-' and 0.55 MPa of initial hydrogen pressure. 223 for several parameters taken from literature [20-24], such as: 0'P, ~TR, OH, (r9, (7I, o''`, Ee, etc. Nature of X On testing the Pavelich-Taft equation [ 19 ] for the effect of the p-X group on the hydrogenation of each E-benzylidene ketone series, a reasonably good fit was obtained for the equation: log (k/ko)=pzoR+&Eg where ko is the reaction rate for X = Me, k is the rate for the other X groups, aR and E9 are the substituent parameters (which are characteristic of the corjugative and steric effects of the X groups, respectively), and pr and ax are the corresponding reaction constants. The results shown in Table 3 were obtained by least-squares multiple regression. Thus, the major role of the X group is of a coWugative and steric nature modifying the adsorption strength between the substrate and the catalyst surface and, thereby, the hydrogenation rate. The results collected in Table 3~show that, in all the cases investigated, the 5x constant, which measures the susceptibility of the reaction to the steric effects, has a negative value, i.e., the reaction rate seemed to be helped by bulky substituents in the pares position of the aromatic ring. Notwithstanding, when R is the phenyl group, the hydrogenation reaction is scarcely susceptible to steric effects in the X group; this, together with the low hydrogenation rates obtained, indicates the hindrance that the phenyl group exerts on the adsorption of the C=C bond of E-benzylideneacetophenones onto the catalyst surface independently of the nature of the X group. On the other hand, the contribution of the resonance on the substituent effect provides a clear indication of the relative importance of reaction enthalpy, since resonance-interacting substituents were found to be enthalpycontrolled and the resonance interaction is only important for electronreleasing groups [21, 22]. Thus the major contribution of enthalpy to the changes in the standard free energy of the reaction is found.

These functional groups can affect the olefinic bond hydrogenation by electronic and/or steric effects modifying the electronic density of the C=C bond and/or blocking the reaction centre. As in the previous case, we have jointly examined both coWugative and steric effects of the R group on relative reactivities by applying the Pavelich-Taft equation [ 19 ]: log (k/k,) =OoR+OEg where ko is the reaction rate for R = Me, k is the rate for the other R groups, oR is the cor~ugative parameter of the R group, E$ is the steric parameter of the R group and pR and O are the corresponding reaction constants. The results summarized in Table 4 were obtained by least-squares multiple regression. A very good fit is obtained in all cases and, furthermore, the regression coefficient is statistically significant at levels over lg'o. Thus structure-activity relationships are well described by multiple regression. As can be seen, the O constant, which measures the susceptibility of the reaction to steric effects in the R group, has a positive value in all the cases, so that the reaction rate is decreased by bulky substituents. Nevertheless, the main influence on the reaction rate is the cor~ugative contribution of the R substituent to the carbonyl group conjugate to the C=C, especially when there is an electron-releasing group in the para-position of the aromatic ring. This fact reflects the activating effect of the electron-releasing group by direct resonance interaction with a substituent R acting as electron donor on a cationic centre. This, together with the sensitivity to solvent polarity, allows us to consider a transition state with some partially developed charges and whose relative stability is determined by the extension of the conjugation between the X and R groups and the olefinic bond. Moreover, the low values of p obtained also account for a concerted mechanism and, in this sense, the Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) model also makes it possible to interpret the existence the small p values in concerted reactions [25, 26]. On the basis of these results, we suggest a cis-concerted mechanism (Fig. 1) for the hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones over Rh/sepiolite TABLE 4 Reaction constants, O and O, and regression coefcients, RT, of the plot log (k/ko) vs. O and E.

Mechanism of the liquid-phase hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones over Rh/sepiolite catalyst. catalyst where the rate-determining step is II in FIg. 1. The concerted character of the hydrogenation is considered as a concerted reaction taking place in a single step. This is different from a concerted synchronous reaction where all the bond-breaking and bond-making processes take place simultaneously [27, 28]. In this mechanism, the active sites on the rhodium surface are regarded as a surface complex [29, 30] with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation where it is possible to adsorb two hydrogens and a molecule of olefin (E-benzylidene ketone) at the same time. The transfer of the two hydrogens to the double bond through a concerted process, in which the interaction with the catalyst removes the symmetry restrictions imposed by the Hoffmann-Woodward rules [31 ], leads directly to p-substituted benzyl ketone formation. Here we have the three classical steps postulated by Horiuti and Polanyi [ 16 ] but, however, in this case we exclude the intermediate half-hydrogenated state which is also considered to be the limiting step in reactions at relatively low hydrogen pressures [32, 33]. Besides, we think that a concerted evolution of the transition state explains the usual cis-addition, noon-reversible character and absence of the double bond isomerization better than does the classically postulated half-hydrogenated species. Whether or not the new bonds in the concerted mechanism do form simultaneously is an open question (the limit could be the half-hydrogenated state). Moreover, this kind of active site, i.e. with three degrees of coordinative 226 unsaturation, in which the simultaneous adsorption of hydrogen and alkene substrate is obtained, can explain the involvement of the two hydrogen atoms in the rate-determining step. Also, it accounts for a different number of rhodium surface atoms that are able to act as active sites for each hydrogen pressure (first order in hydrogen). Conclusions The Rh/sepiolite catalyst is found to be a very efficient catalyst for the regioselective 1,4-hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones into saturated ones without any secondary products. Furthermore, the hydrogenation of Ebenzylidene ketones over Rh /sepiolite catalyst is influence d by the simultaneous action of both coWugative and steric effects in X and R groups. This occurs through a transition state with some partially developed charge and whose relative stability is determined by the extension of the resonance between the X and R groups and the olefinic bond. A cis-concerted mechanism taking place in a single step on a rhodium site with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation is suggested. On that site the alkene and two hydrogen atoms can adsorb at the same time.

Cabello J.M. Campelo ∗ A. Garcia D. Luna J.M. Marinas Organic Chemistry Department, Cordoba University, E-14004 Cordoba Spain The liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of benzylidene ketones, in the p-XC6H4-CHCHCOR form (E isomers; XH, Me, MeO, Cl; RMe, Et, n-Pr, i-Pr, t-Bu, n-Pe, Ph) was carried out using a sepiolite-supported rhodium catalyst (1 wt.% Rh) in methanol solvent under low hydrogen pressure (0.55 MPa) and at room temperature (298 K). The reactions were selective with respect to the formation of the conjugate reduction product (p-XC6H4CH2CH2COR) although a very slight amount of benzyl ketone (hydrogenolysis of the CCl bond) is found in p-chlorobenzylidene ketones. The influence of both X and R substituents was analyzed by the Pavelich-Taft equation and both conjugative and steric effects of X and R groups were found to simultaneously influence the reaction process. A cis-concerted mechanism, including a transition state with some partially developed charge, is assumed for the hydrogenation of E-benzylidene ketones over Rh/ sepiolite catalysts. Here, the concerted character of the hydrogenation is considered as a reaction taking place in a single step on a rhodium surface site with three degrees of coordinative unsaturation.
