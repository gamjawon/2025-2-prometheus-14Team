Introduction Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine is an active catalyst for water-gas shift reaction [ 14] as well as for hydroformylation [5,6]. Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine supported on a silica carrier has a tendency like rhodium with tertiary amines [ 7-15 ] or the industrial HCo(CO) 3PBu3 catalyst [ 16 ] to selectively convert olefins and synthesis gas to alcohols. In this paper we describe how Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine supported on various inorganic carriers can be used as 1-hexene hydroformylation catalysts. *Corresponding author; fax.

Experimental 2.1. Reagents All of the substrates, gases and solvents were of commercial origin. Ru3(CO),2 was purchased from Aldrich or Johnson Matthey and 2,2'-bipyridine from Aldrich. Akzo Chemie supplied the Silica f22 carrier and PQ Corporation the CS 1231, 1030X and 1040 silica carriers. W.R. Grace AB supplied the Silica gel 360, silica alumina, silica titania and silica magnesia carriers. Zeofinn Oy supplied the Zeolex aluminium silicate, Zeothix, Zeofree, Zeodent and Zeozyl silicas and Hubesorb calcium silicate. All the materials were handled in oxygen-free conditions [ 17 ] . 2.2. Analysis of carriers Surface areas of the carriers were determined by a Micromeritics, rapid surface area analyzer, Model 2200. Surface compositions of carriers were analyzed by ESCA (XPS) (Surface Science Instruments electron spectrometer, X-probe, Model 101) 2.3. Modification of silica carrier Silica f22 was modified with TiC14 or with SnC14 [ 18 ] . 2.4. Preparation of catalysts A typical catalyst was prepared by mixing 0.192 g Ru3(CO),2, 0.146 g 2,2'biPyridine and 6.0 g silicon dioxide in THF or in CH2C12 for 16 h. The solvent was evaporated. The impregnated catalyst was activated at 100 C under nitrogen in 17 h, whereby the colour of the catalyst turned dark blue. Ruthenium contents of catalysts were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy in a helium atmosphere (Siemens SRS 303 spectrometer). The Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst was also prepared as in a water-gas shift reaction [ 1-4] . 0.130 g Ru3(CO),2 and 0.098 g 2,2'-bipyridine were impregnated on 4.0 g of silica gel in CHZC12 for 2 h. The solution was evaporated by evacuation, and the catalyst mixture was rinsed with nitrogen for 2 h and activated at 100 C for 48 h. After the activation period carbon monoxide and water-gas (fed at 140-150 C) were conducted over the catalyst. The water-gas shift reaction was maintained for 48 h, and then the catalyst was used in hydroformylation. A catalyst was also prepared in a glass reaction flask by activating 0.066 g Ru3(CO),Z and 0.049 g 2,2'-bipyridine at 100 C without solvent. A dark blue complex was formed on the glass surface. The solvent (THF) could be present during the activation, when the dark blue active complex was precipitated. G. Alvila et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 335-342 337 2.5. Ruthenium dissolution tests In a typical dissolution test the activated catalyst (1.0 g) and 3-methyl- l-butanol (isoamyl alcohol) (50 ml) were magnetically stirred under nitrogen. The samples for ruthenium analysis were taken after 1.5 h at room temperature, after 1, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 h at 130 C, and after 21 h at room temperature. The solid catalyst was separated from solution, dried and the ruthenium content was analyzed. 2.6. Hydroformylation reaction Hydroformylation reactions were carried out in a high-pressure autoclave (Berghof 75 ml). 1-Hexene (8 mmol), toluene (5 ml), benzene (0.2 ml as internal standard), 0.5 g catalyst and 50 bar CO/H2 were charged into the autoclave, which was warmed up to 150 C. The reaction was maintained for 17 h and the autoclave was cooled in liquid nitrogen and depressurized. The organic solution and the catalyst were separated. 2.7. Analysis of hydroformylation solutions The organic components of hydroformylation solutions were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (Carlo Erba 4130) . The products were characterized by IR (Nicolet 20SXC) and NMR spectroscopy (Broker AM-250) . The ruthenium content of the hydroformylation solutions was analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer 2380 equipped with a hollow cathode ruthenium-platinum lamp). Methyl isobutyl ketone was the solvent for standards and samples. Another method of ruthenium analysis was ICPES (ARL ICP 3520B) . Xylene was the solvent and the operating wavelength was 240.272 nm. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine supported on various inorganic carriers as 1hexene hydroformylation catalysts Ru3(CO),2 and 2,2'-bipyridine supported on various inorganic carriers were active in the hydroformylation of I-hexene (Table 1) . The best yields of oxygenates were obtained with Silica f22 (maximum 97%) and with silica magnesia (57% ) carriers. Silica alumina and silica titania were the only totally inert carriers of Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine catalysts in oxygenate formation. The amount of dissolved ruthenium seemed to increase with the yield of oxygenates. More than 100 ppm of ruthenium dissolved from Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine/CS 1040 silica into the hydroformylation solution with the 6% alcohol content.

The Ru3(CO),z/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst supported on the silica f22 carrier and activated in a water-gas shift reaction also showed moderate activity in hydroformylation. Again, ruthenium dissolved especially in the alcohol product. 3.2. Dissolution of Ru3(CO),212,2'-bipyridine from inorganic carriers In the hydroformylation tests the bond between the Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine complex and the carrier was broken and hundreds of ppm's of ruthenium from the product were detected after the hydroformylation reaction. For a better understanding of the stability of the catalyst, so-called dissolution tests were carried out (Table 2). Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine was dissolved in 1-hexene, toluene, octanal, octanol or 3-methyl- l-butanol. The ruthenium content of the catalyst varied with the carrier. The ruthenium percentages determined were 0.8-1.4% by weight, when the theoretical maximum content of ruthenium was 1.4 wt.%. There was a clear indication that the catalyst from Hubesorb, CS 1231 or CS 1040 carriers did not dissolve in 1-hexene or toluene. Even after refluxing, the ruthenium contents of the solutions were below the detection limit, 10 ppm. On the other hand, octanal, octanol and 3-methyl-lbutanol, typical hydroformylation products, proved to be good solvents for the ruthenium from the catalysts, and maximum ruthenium contents of test solutions were 30-292 ppm. It is notable that only trace amounts of the ruthenium complex were dissolved from CS carriers. Silica f22 was stable when the solvent was aldehyde, but even 70 ppm of ruthenium was dissolved into octanol. Ruthenium's dissolution differences from various carrier materials are not related to the chemical composition or the surface structure. Much more ruthenium, as much as 400 ppm, was dissolved from Ru3(CO),Z/2,2'-bipyridine on the glass surface than from the catalysts supported on the inorganic carriers. 3.3. Testing of homogeneity and heterogeneity of Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst The Ru3(CO),2/2,2'-bipyridine catalyst is active but unstable in the hydroformylation reaction. The main question is whether the dissolved ruthenium is necessary for good oxygenate yields or whether the formation of oxygenates caused ruthenium to dissolve. In order to answer this question a three-part series of experiments was carried out. First, the catalyst was prepared without the carrier in THF, 3-methyl- 1-butanol, CHZC12 or hexane. A solid dark blue precipitate was separated, and a liquid phase was used as the catalyst in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. \"The liquid catalyst\" converted 6-34% of 1-hexene to internal hexenes. No oxygenates were produced with the catalysts prepared in THF and 3-methyl- l-butanol, and only 5-6% with the catalysts prepared in CHZC12 or hexane.

L. Alvila et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 97 (/994) 335-342 341 the catalyst mixture of the dark blue precipitate and the liquid phase (the unseparated catalyst) produced about a 50% yield of oxygenates. The hydroformylation tests indicated that it is possible to prepare an active catalyst in a solvent, but the catalyst is an extremely fine suspension in the solvent. Careful filtration removed the active component from the liquid phase. Second, the catalyst was prepared on a silica f22 carrier and then washed with 3-methyl-l-butanol. Both the washed RU3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine/ silica f22 and the alcohol solution were used as hydroformylation catalysts. Alcohol had ability to dissolve the active Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine complex, because the oxygenate yields were 30% even when the alcohol solution was a catalyst. However, when using the washed Ru3(CO)1z/2,2'-bipyridine/silica f22 catalyst, the best oxygenate yields were 95-97%. The conclusion was that the solid carrier was necessary for good oxygenate yields, because without the carrier the activity of the system was essentially lower. Third, the standard hydroformylation reaction was carried out with Ru3 (CO) 12 / 2,2'-bipyridine/silica f22 catalyst. The liquid product was separated from the solid catalyst. The reaction was continued by addition of 1-hexene both on the previouslyused solid catalyst and into the separated liquid phase. The catalyst on the carrier was still active in the second hydroformylation reaction producing 30% yields of alcohols. Looking at the first step, the liquid phase catalyst could not improve the oxygenate yields. 4. Conclusions Ru3(CO)12/2,2'-bipyridine supported on various inorganic carriers showed activity in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. However, ruthenium was dissolved from carriers in hydroformylation reactions. According to the special dissolution tests differences between various solvents and carrier materials were shown. Oxygenates, aldehydes and alcohols, were good solvents for the Ru3(CO) I2/2,2'-bipyridine complex. The amount of ruthenium in hydroformylation products depended almost linearly on the yield of oxygenates. The active catalyst proved to be heterogeneous, but partly in suspension in the reaction product. References [1] Finn. Pat. 69620 (1986), US Pat. 4 699 775 (1987), Can. Pat. 1 248 933 (1989) to T.
