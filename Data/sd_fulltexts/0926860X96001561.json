As a reference material, a PdzsZr75 amorphous alloy was used. The oxidation of the amorphous precursors led, in some cases, to highly active catalysts for the deep oxidation of methane. The chemical and morphological changes occurring during activation by oxidation in air were followed by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and BET surface area measurements. Component X had a strong influence on these changes and consequently on the final activity of the materials. The thermoanalytical studies revealed marked differences in the crystallization and oxidation behavior of the alloys. The BET surface area of the precursor alloys was < 0.1 m2/g and increased, depending on component X, to 1.1-34.1 m2/g upon oxidation (activation) of the samples. XRD indicated the presence of PdO and poorly crystalline monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 in all activated samples. Kinetic studies were carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor at temperatures of 400-1000 K and atmospheric pressure using a reactant mixture with a ratio CH4:Oz = 1:4. The alloy precursors showed no significant activity mainly due to their low surface area. The activity of the activated (oxidized) alloys depended strongly on component X and decreased in the order Pd > Ni > Cu > Co > Mn > Cr. Catalysts derived from Pd25Zr75 and Ni10Pd~sZr75 showed relatively good catalytic stability even after ageing for 15 h at 1000 K under reaction atmosphere, whereas the other catalysts showed strong deactivation at higher temperatures. Reduction of the catalysts by hydrogen with subsequent reoxidation of the reduced components by the reaction atmosphere in most cases led to more active catalysts.

Miiller et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 145 (1996) 335-349 1. Introduction The principal advantage of both catalytic combustion and catalytically stabi- lized combustion of hydrocarbons is their low pollutant emissions [1-7]. Palla- dium based catalysts have been reported to be among the most active catalyst materials for the deep oxidation of methane [1,3,6-8] and are therefore exten- sively investigated [9-23]. However, only few articles deal with the effect of additives of other metals or metal oxides on the behavior of supported palladium catalysts for the combustion of methane [7,16]. A major advantage of the use of glassy metals as catalyst precursors resides in the possibility of choosing a variety of compositions and of obtaining an intimate mixing of the constituents on atomic level. Furthermore, no disturbing residuals due to the use of salts as precursors are present in the catalyst after preparation. Several studies report problems which arise due to the use of salts as precursors, resulting in chlorine or nitric residuals affecting the behavior of the catalyst [13,15,20]. Glassy metals in the as-prepared state usually exhibit low catalytic activity because of their low intrinsic surface areas. In most catalytic applications of glassy metals, their pretreatment was found to be crucial to obtain high catalytic activity [24]. The surfaces of the glassy metals thereby undergo drastic chemical and structural changes. For PdzsZr75 it has been shown that exposition to oxidative conditions leads to the oxidation of the amorphous alloy, resulting in intimately mixed palladium phases (Pd and PdO) and zirconia [25]. Controlled oxidation is necessary to guarantee desired properties of the final catalyst. Furthermore, reduction of previously oxidized catalysts has been reported to increase the catalytic activity of supported palladium [9,18,21 ]. Considering the oxidation state of the components in the catalysts after reduction and subsequent catalytic testing under reaction atmosphere, the ratio between metallic palladium and palladium oxide, present after exposing the reduced materials to an oxida- tive reaction atmosphere, is of special interest. The objective of the present work was to elucidate the potential of ternary amorphous alloys with the composition X~oPdlsZr75 (X -- Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni) as catalyst precursors for the total oxidation of methane. Special emphasis was devoted to the influence of the ternary component on the structural and catalytic properties and on the stability of the catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst precursors The amorphous alloys used as catalyst precursors were prepared from the pre-mixed melt of the pure constituents by rapid quenching using the technique C.A. MUller et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 335-349 337 of melt spinning. The resulting ribbons were ground into flakes of 100-200 Ixm size in the case of MnloPdlsZr75 and of 200-400 Ixm size for the other alloys. The as-prepared amorphous alloys with the nominal composition PdlsZr75X ~0 (X = Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni) and the resulting catalysts are described through- out the work by using the chemical symbol of the ternary component (X). The reference alloy PdzsZr75 is referred to as Pd. 2.2. Physico-chemical characterization X-ray analysis was carried out on a Siemens D5000 powder X-ray diffrac- tometer in a step mode (step size 0.01and 0.3 s) using Ni-filtered CuKa radiation (35 mA, 45 kV). The patterns obtained were compared with JCPDS data files (JCPDS Mineral Powder Diffraction Data Files, Park Lane, Pennsylva- nia). Thermoanalytical investigations (DTA/TG) were carried out at atmospheric pressure on a Netzsch STA 409 thermoanalyzer equipped with PtRhl0/Pt thermocouples and Pt crucibles. Samples were heated at 10 K/min under Ar (30 cm3/min) to follow the crystallization of the glassy metals and under H2 to investigate the reduction behavior of the oxidized samples. The oxidation of the alloys was studied under flowing air (30 cm3/min) using a heating rate of 5 K/min. As a reference, a-A1203 was used. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. Prior to measurements, the samples were degassed in vacuum at 423 K for 1 h. The surface areas (SBE~) were calculated in a relative pressure range P/Po between 0.05 and 0.25, assuming a cross-sec- tional area of 0.162 nm2 for the nitrogen molecule. 2.3. Catalytic tests Kinetic measurements were carried out in a continuous fixed-bed microreac- tor operated at atmospheric pressure using a mass spectrometer (Balzers GAM 400) for gas analysis. Details of the apparatus have been reported elsewhere [23]. Comparative catalytic tests were performed using an amount of oxidized catalyst obtained from 0.25 g amorphous alloy under a reactant flow rate of 300 cm3 (STP)/min in the temperature range 400-1000 K. The reaction gas mixture, premixed from pure gases without further purification, consisted of 1% CH4 (99.995%) and 4% 02 (99.999%) in a helium balance (99.998%). Catalysts were investigated after activation in air (oxidation) as well as after subsequent reduction in hydrogen. Prior to kinetic tests, the catalysts were conditioned in the reaction gas mixture for 1 h at 800 K and then quenched to room temperature (air activated samples only). After increasing the temperature in steps of ca. 50 K from 400 to 1000 K (initial activity test), the samples were kept on stream at 1000 K for 15 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature, 338 C.A.

Methane conversions were calculated on the basis of a carbon balance including CO2 and CH4. The carbon balance showed a maximum deviation of 2%. Previous studies [23] indicated, that no carbon monoxide is produced under the experimental conditions applied. Reduction of the activated alloys was performed by heating the samples under a hydrogen-helium stream (total flow 300 cm3/min, 95% He, 5% H2) to 573-773 K (Table 1) and maintaining the temperature for 1 h under a stream of 50% H2 in He (total flow rate 36 cm3/min). Subsequently, the samples were heated under helium at the same temperature for 1 h to decompose possibly formed palladium hydride (285 cm3/min He). 3. Results 3.1. Thermal behavior of the amorphous precursors The influence of the ternary component on the crystallization and oxidation behavior of the amorphous alloys was studied using thermoanalytical methods and X-ray diffraction. X-ray analysis of the glassy metal alloys indicated some crystallinity for the samples Mn, Cu and Cr, whereas the other samples were X-ray amorphous.

XRD patterns (CuK ct) of the amorphous precursors after crystallization in Ar (Fig. !). The crystallization behavior of the amorphous precursors in argon, as exam- ined by DTA, is shown in Fig. 1. Crystallization, indicated by characteristic exothennic events in the temperature range 600-910 K, occurs in two dis- cernible steps for all alloys except Co, where three peaks can be distinguished. The endothermic peak centered at 1025 K for Cr is attributed to the eutectoidic transformation in the system Pd-Zr, which occurs for PdlZr2 and oL-Zr at 1028 K [26]. The heat of crystallization for all alloys except Cr are presented in Table 1. After crystallization, all samples contain a mixture of PdlZr2 and oL-Zr, as evidenced by XRD (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 depicts the oxidation behavior of the amorphous alloys in air, as monitored by TG and DTA. The oxidation of the reference material Pd occurs in two steps, leading to the formation of zirconia and palladium oxide. Complete oxidation is accomplished at ca. 870 K. The weight loss around 1073 K is due to the endothermic decomposition of PdO into metallic palladium and oxygen. A similar oxidation behavior is observed for Cu, Ni, and Co, with the onset temperature of oxidation increasing in the order Pd < Cu < Ni < Co. The oxida- tion behavior of Mn and Cr is distinctively different. No weight loss due to PdO decomposition is observed because the last part of the total oxidation of the alloy and the decomposition of palladium oxide occur in the same temperature range. The rather high oxidation temperature of Cr is probably caused by the passivation of the starting alloy by a surface Cr203-1ayer, resulting in complete oxidation only at high temperatures. The temperature used for the activation (oxidation) of the amorphous alloys was chosen based on the results of the thermoanalytical investigation of the crystallization and oxidation behavior. In order to obtain catalytically active materials with suitable textural and structural properties, sintering phenomena have to be avoided. This can be achieved by carrying out the activation under conditions where the oxidation rate is considerably higher than the crystalliza- tion rate. Note that the oxidation rate of amorphous metal alloys is generally higher than that of the corresponding crystalline materials [24,27]. C.A.

Bulk structure of alloys after oxidation in air The transformation of the amorphous precursors to the catalytically active materials was achieved by exposing the alloys to air at different temperatures (Table 1). The resulting catalysts are additionally labelled by the activation temperature. Fig. 4 depicts the XRD patterns of the activated samples. The catalysts consist of a mixture of poorly crystalline tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia, and palladium oxide. A minor amount of metallic palladium was found for Cr-973, indicating incomplete oxidation (Fig. 4). For comparison, the main reflections of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, PdO, and Pd are indicated in Fig. 4. The amount of tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2) depends on the activation temperature, with higher temperatures favoring the monoclinic modification (m-ZrO2), as well as on the stabilizing effect of the ternary component. The largest fraction of t-ZrO2 is found for Co, whereas Cr contains predominantly m-ZrO2. Due to the low concentration and the high dispersion of the ternary component no clearly discernible reflections of the third component are visible. 342 C.A.

Note the different degree of crystallinity of monoclinic zirconia. The chemical and bulk structural changes in the amorphous alloys occurring during activation in air are accompanied by significant changes in the textural properties. The BET surface areas of the samples (precursor alloys < 0.1 m2/g) increased to 1.1-34.1 m2/g for the activated samples (Table 1). The observed great variation in SBEv after activation can be attributed to the different activation temperatures, ranging from 673 to 973 K, and to the varying stabilization effect of the ternary component onto zirconia. 3.3. Catalytic behavior of alloys activated in air Fig. 5 shows methane conversions as a function of temperature for the various catalysts. Depending on the sample composition, more or less pro- nounced deactivation was observed for the air-activated samples at higher temperatures. Therefore, the initial activities of the samples are compared with the activities of the catalysts after 15 h methane oxidation at 1000 K. The overall activity of the air-activated samples is characterized by the temperature necessary to reach 50% CH4 conversion, Tx(50) (Table 1). During initial catalytic testing, Pd-623 converted 50% methane at the lowest temperature, 634 K, whereas 868 K was needed for the least active catalyst, Cr-973. The activity of the alloy-derived catalysts decreases in the order Pd-623 > Ni-673 > Cu-623 > Co-873 > Mn-723 > Cr-973. Deactivation with Pd-623 and Ni-673 is only observed for temperatures around 1000 K and is attributed to the decomposition of palladium oxide [19,21,28]. The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that Pd-623, Ni-673 and Cr-973 are the most stable catalysts. The slight loss in activity is attributed to sintering, as indicated by the respective BET surface areas listed in Table 1. Cu-623, Co-873 and Mn-723 exhibit lower activity (Fig. 5) with the onset of methane conversion being at significantly higher temperatures than found for Pd-623. The activity of these samples was markedly affected by deactivation at tempera- C,A.

The measurements after long term treatment for Co-873 and Mn-723 are characterized by a strong decrease in catalytic activity, whereas methane conversion was less affected for Cu-623. Note that complete conver- sion of methane was not obtained up to 1000 K with these catalysts. Comparing the initial activity, Cr-973 was found to be the least active catalyst, but in contrast to the other samples the activity increased slightly after 15 h on stream at 1000 K. The BET surface areas of the catalysts subjected to catalytic testing after 15 h on stream at 1000 K are compared to those before initial activity test in Table 1. After high temperature exposure, a substantial loss of surface area is found for Cu-623, Ni-673, and Co-873, resulting in S~ET values between 1 and 2 m2 g-~, whereas a less pronounced decrease in SBET was observed for Pd-623. The initially small surface areas of Mn-723 and Cr-973 (1.1 and 1.7 m2 g-~) remained almost constant during long term exposure at 1000 K and subsequent additional testing. 344 C.A.

XRD patterns (CuK~) of the catalysts after 15 h on stream at 1000 K and catalytic testing. The XRD patterns of the catalysts after long term exposure (15 h catalytic testing and additional catalytic tests followed by quenching from high tempera- tures) are shown in Fig. 6. Most striking changes compared to the XRD patterns for the samples before kinetic measurements (Fig. 4) are the higher degree of crystallinity for the monoclinic zirconia and the appearance of metallic palla- dium in the patterns of Cr-973 and Ni-673. The PdO peak of Cu-623 centered at 33.92(9 is slightly shifted towards higher 2(9 values. The reason for this shift is not clear, because no Pd-O-Cu phase is described in the corresponding phase diagram reported in the literature [29]. 3.4. Catalytic activity of reduced catalysts As mentioned in the introduction, it has been reported that the methane combustion activity of supported palladium catalysts increases when catalysts are reduced with hydrogen before use [9,18,21]. In order to study the influence of pre-reduction on the catalytic behavior, the catalysts activated in air were reduced before catalytic testing in situ in a flow of 50% H2/He for 1 h at the temperatures indicated in Table 1. Reduction temperatures were chosen on the basis of preliminary TPR experiments to warrant complete reduction of PdO to Pd. XRD analysis of the samples after reduction (Fig. 7) shows the presence of zirconia phases and metallic palladium for Pd-623, Mn-723 and Cr-973. With Ni-673, Cu-623 and Co-873 the characteristic reflection of metallic palladium at 2/9= 40.1(JCDPS file 5-681) is slightly shifted towards higher 2(9 values. The formation of intermetallic compounds of the component X (X = Co, Cu and Ni) with palladium is possible [26] and probably explains the shifted peaks. No indication for the presence of palladium oxide and the ternary components is seen by XRD for all samples. After in-situ reduction and subsequent decomposition of the palladium hy- drides in helium, the samples were exposed to the reaction gas mixture at room C.A.

A strong exothermicity was observed for all catalysts caused by the partial reoxidation of the palladium component. Measured activities as a func- tion of temperature are depicted in Fig. 8. A significant increase in activity for the reduced catalysts, as compared to the samples tested after oxidation, was observed at lower temperatures for Pd-623, Cu-623, Ni-673 and Cr-973, whereas the activity remained virtually unchanged for Co-873 and Mn-723. Analogous to the oxidized catalysts, full conversion was only measured for Pd-623 and Ni-673. With reduced Cr-973, methane conversion started at markedly lower temperature, as compared to the oxidized catalyst, but the conversion leveled off at higher temperature to reach a plateau at ca. 53% conversion. The increased activity of Cr-973 at lower temperatures is also reflected by the temperature corresponding to 50% CH4 conversion, T~}~b) (Table 1), which increases in the order Pd < Ni < Cu = Cr < Co < Mn. The pre-reduced catalysts showed more pronounced deactivation at elevated temperatures as compared to the corre- sponding unreduced samples. The XRD patterns of the reduced catalysts after catalytic testing are presented in Fig. 9. A distinct PdO peak is visible for all catalysts, whereas reflections due to metallic palladium are only found for Cr-973. This confirmed that metallic palladium, exposed to the reaction atmosphere, undergoes oxidation, as already indicated by the observed strong exothermicity when exposing the reduced catalysts to the reacting gases at room temperature. 4. Discussion Due to the intrinsically low surface areas of the amorphous materials ( < 0.1 m2 g-~), virtually no activity for methane oxidation is observed without pretreatment of the catalyst precursors. High catalytic activity was gained by oxidation of the alloys in air, resulting in drastic changes of the bulk and surface C.A. Miiller et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 335-349 347 structure of the materials. The temperature of oxidation was found to depend strongly on the ternary component with Cr requiring temperatures exceeding 900 K. With all alloys oxidation in air led to the formation of palladium oxide and zirconia, as evidenced by XRD. No indication for oxides of the ternary component was found by X-ray analysis due to low concentration combined with high dispersion of the ternary component. However, from the known oxidation behavior of these metals, it is clear that stable oxides must have been formed under the oxidation conditions used. In the case of Cr, Ni, and Cu, the stable oxides at temperatures of oxidation are Cr203, NiO, and CuO, respec- tively. Oxidation of Co results in CoO and Co304, from which Co304 is unstable and decomposes to CoO and oxygen at temperatures above 1023 K [30-34]. The oxidation of Mn above 673 K yields MnO, Mn304, and Mn203 [35-41]. The zirconium constituent is transformed into a mixture of poorly crystalline tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia with the latter being predominant for all samples, as indicated by XRD. Activation was accompanied by an increase in surface area which varied within a wide range depending on the precursor alloy. As regards the catalytic behavior of the catalysts, Pd-623 and Ni-673 exhib- ited both high activity. Furthermore, also the thermal stability of the catalysts was superior compared to the others (Figs. 5 and 8). In contrast with the other ternary catalysts, pronounced deactivation occurred at elevated temperatures. The catalytic activity of the ternary catalysts during initial testing decreased in the order Ni-673 > Cu-623 > Co-873 > Mn-723 > Cr-973. It is interesting to compare this activity sequence with the one expected for the corresponding pure metal oxides reported in the literature. Whereas Co304 was consistently shown to exhibit highest activity among the various oxides tested [8,42,43], no clear picture emerges for the activity patterns of NiO, CuO, MnOx and Cr203 [8]. Usually, MnO2 or Mn203 is judged to be more active than NiO. Cr203 varies to be among the most or among the least active catalysts, depending on the conditions used. Specific catalytic activities at high excess of 02 are reported in [43], giving a decreasing activity of the metal oxide in the order Co304 > NiO > MnO2 > Cr203 > CuO. This sequence is different to that observed for the catalysts prepared from the ternary alloys containing these metal oxides, which suggests that the overall catalytic activity cannot be considered as the sum of the specific activities of palladium oxide and the oxide of the ternary metal component. The importance of the ternary metal (X) seems therefore mainly to reside in its influence on the structural and morphological properties of the final catalyst and less in its intrinsic catalytic activity. The overall activity of the catalysts is strongly dependent on the BET surface area of the catalysts. A higher BET surface area seems to be indicative of higher Pd dispersion in as-prepared catalysts. The catalysts with the highest BET surface areas after activation by oxidation and before catalytic testing exhibit highest catalytic activity (Pd, Ni, Cu and Mn, see Table 1). The BET surface 348 C.A. Miiller et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 335-349 area of Pd-623 is smaller than the area of Cu-623, but Pd-623 is more active, which is attributed to its higher palladium content. The catalytic behavior of Ni-673 is striking, both activity and stability resemble that of Pd-623. The BET surface area of Pd before catalytic testing (24.4 m2 g-1) decreases only by a factor of three to 8.0 m2 g-l, whereas the surface areas of the ternary catalysts decrease more drastically to 1-2 m2 g-l, indicating pronounced sintering. Despite the extreme loss of surface area (from 22.0 m2 g-l tO 1.2 m2 g-1) during long term exposure to 1000 K, the activity of Ni-673 decreased to a similar degree as that of Pd-623. This is an indication that the behavior of Ni-673 cannot be explained based on textural properties alone. XPS measure- ments have been carried out with Ni-673 after reduction and catalytic testing. This catalyst showed a significant enrichment of Ni on the surface, whereas the Pd surface concentration decreased. An enhancement of the catalytic activity can therefore not be explained by a higher amount of palladium exposed after reduction. In any case, the catalytic results clearly indicate, that the more expensive palladium can be substituted by a certain amount of nickel without substantial loss in catalytic activity and stability. It has been shown that reduction subsequent to activation in air offers a possibility to increase the activity of all catalysts, except Mn-723 and Co-873. However, the pre-reduced catalysts seem to be less stable. The reduction results in metallic palladium, which is rapidly oxidized in the reacting gas atmosphere, even at room temperature. Thus, enhanced conversion cannot be attributed to metallic palladium existing after reduction. The strong deactivation in the temperature region, where decomposition of palladium oxide occurs, indicates that this phase is the most active component of the catalysts. 5. Conclusions Active catalysts for the deep oxidation of methane have been prepared from ternary amorphous alloys with the composition XloPdlsZr75 (X = Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni) and Pd25Zr75 by oxidation of the materials under air. The transfor- mation of the precursor alloys to the final catalysts was accompanied by a drastic gain in surface area and porosity and a concomitant increase in catalytic activity. The activity in the combustion of a feed containing 1% CH4 and 4% 02 in a He balance decreased in the order Pd-623 > Ni-673 > Cu-623 > Co-873 > Mn-723 > Cr-973. High thermal stability was found for Pd and Ni, whereas the other catalysts showed pronounced deactivation at higher temperatures. Pre-reduction of the air-activated catalysts by hydrogen resulted in a significant increase in catalytic activity for all samples, except Mn-723 and Co-873. XRD measurements revealed that metallic palladium was reoxidized under reaction conditions. The possibility of replacing part of palladium by less expensive Ni C.A. Miiller et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 335-349 349 without a significant loss in catalytic activity and thermal stability offers an interesting perspective for this type of methane oxidation catalysts.

Tel.: (+41-1) 6323153; fax: (+41-1) 6321163 Catalysts for the combustion of methane have been prepared by controlled oxidation of various ternary amorphous alloys with the composition X10Pd15Zr75 (X = Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni). As a reference material, a Pd25Zr75 amorphous alloy was used. The oxidation of the amorphous precursors led, in some cases, to highly active catalysts for the deep oxidation of methane. The chemical and morphological changes occurring during activation by oxidation in air were followed by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and BET surface area measurements. Component X had a strong influence on these changes and consequently on the final activity of the materials. The thermoanalytical studies revealed marked differences in the crystallization and oxidation behavior of the alloys. The BET surface area of the precursor alloys was <0.1 m2/g and increased, depending on component X, to 1.1–34.1 m2/g upon oxidation (activation) of the samples. XRD indicated the presence of PdO and poorly crystalline monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 in all activated samples. Kinetic studies were carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor at temperatures of 400–1000 K and atmospheric pressure using a reactant mixture with a ratio CH4:O2= 1:4. The alloy precursors showed no significant activity mainly due to their low surface area. The activity of the activated (oxidized) alloys depended strongly on component X and decreased in the order Pd > Ni > Cu > Co > Mn > Cr. Catalysts derived from Pd25Zr75 and Ni10Pd15Zr75 showed relatively good catalytic stability even after ageing for 15 h at 1000 K under reaction atmosphere, whereas the other catalysts showed strong deactivation at higher temperatures. Reduction of the catalysts by hydrogen with subsequent reoxidation of the reduced components by the reaction atmosphere in most cases led to more active catalysts.
