RAVINDRANATHAN THAMPI* and MICHAEL GRATZEL Institut de Chimie Physique, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne (Switzerland) (Received June 13,1989; accepted October 23,1989) Summary Palladium oxide supported on TiOg, AlgOa, LagOs, NbgOs and SiOg served as water oxidation catalysts. The following test reaction was employed: 2H30+4Ce4+ oetaly8t 4Ce3++02+4H+ TiOa- and AlgOa-supported catalysts functioned most efficiently. It has been shown that palladium oxide (4.4%) supported on TiOa is very stable, no degradation being observed after 20 turnovers. The reaction was shown to be first order with respect to Ce44\". Introduction The study of Og and Cig evolution on metal oxides has drawn wide attention because of its industrial and technological applications (1). A decade ago photochemists began to show renewed interest in these materials as possible catalysts for photo-oxidation of water to store light energy [2 7]. This is achieved by a combination of the following photo-redox process: A+D^A-+D+ (1) where D is a photoactive donor and A the electron acceptor. This is followed by a catalytic step, where a hydrogen evolution catalyst is generally used: A- + H^O catatyrt eHa + OH- + A (2) However, to render this process cyclic, D4' should be converted back to D by the simultaneous oxidation of water. A second catalyst is therefore necessary to assist oxygen evolution from water. D+ + ^0 ca^ H\" + iOa + D (3) *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 32 Several metal oxides such as RuOa, IrOa, RhgOs, MngOa, MnOg etc., can serve as catalysts for reaction (3) [8, 9]. RuOg, although widely studied and most efficient of all, has the drawback of being corroded to RuC>4, leading to irreversible destruction of the catalyst. Several modifications have been suggested to improve the life of this material, such as dispersing it over supports like TiOg with further pretreatments [7]. In this paper we report our observations that palladium oxide can also be a very stable and efficient oxygen evolution catalyst when supported on a suitable oxide support. To our knowledge this oxide has not previously been studied as an oxygen evolution catalyst for water cleavage reactions, and has attracted only little attention as an electrocatalyst for Og or Cig evolution during industrial electrolysis [1,10]. Various oxide supports, such as AlgOa, TiOg, Zr02, LagOs, SiOg, NbzOa, etc., have been employed during this study. A well-established reaction involving water oxidation by Ce4\"1\" in dil. HgSO^ has been used as a test reaction [E (Ce^/Ce3\"1\") = 1.44 V]: 2H2U + 4Ce4+ Mtaly8t 4Ce3+ + Oa + 4H+ (4) Experimental Loading of palladium oxide on supports such as AlaOa, TiOg, ZrOg, SiOg, LagOg and NhgOs (all oxide supports were supplied by Degussa A.G., F.R.G.) was carried out by hydrolysis deposition techniques. Required amounts of PdCL 2H20 (supplied by K and K Labs., U.S.A.) were dissolved in 100ml HC1 (0.1 M). The oxide support was added to the solution after raising the solution temperature to 70 C. Under constant stirring at this temperature, the pH of the solution was slowly raised to 10.6 by adding O.lMNaOH solution over a period of 5-6 h. The suspension was allowed to evaporate to dryness. The resulting powder was heated to 170 C for 18 h, followed by heating at 370 C for another 18 h. NaCl formed during the neutralisation stage was removed by dialysis over 4 days using de-ionised water. After dialysis, the powder was dried and stored. This procedure was followed because catalysts prepared in this way have a more or less homogeneous particle size distribution [11,12]. Pure PdO was supplied by Fluka, Switzerland. A Pyrex glass cell was used for the experiment, having an inlet and an outlet for bubbling He to purge out dissolved air in the solution. The cell also has a side arm in which the catalyst was kept during He purge. After 30 min of gas purge, the catalyst in the side arm was mixed with the solution. Corrections were applied for any traces of residual air remaining in the cell or on the catalyst surface by measuring the quantity of N3 in the gas phase. Gas samples were withdrawn periodically through a septum and analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped with molecular sieve 5 A column under He carrier gas. 33 For each experiment, 50 mg catalyst and 20ml 00(804)2 solution in 0.5 M HgSC^ were used. All the experiments were carried out in darkness to prevent possible photoexcitation of TiOg support. Percentage dispersion of loaded palladium oxide was estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and also by Hg chemisorption technique after reducing it to Pd. Elemental analysis was carried out to check the metal loading and impurities. Results and discussion The influence of supports was studied by loading 4.4% palladium oxide on the following supports: TiOa (P25), AlgOs, SiOa, ZrOg, NbgOa and La^Os- The amount of Og detected in gas phase is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of time. The data indicates that TiOg and AlgOa are the best supports, whereas SiOz is poor in terms of catalytic activity. AlgOg and TiOz-supported catalysts showed similar rates of reaction. The supports are graded in the following order based on their activity: TiOg = AlgOa > LaaOa > NbgOa > ZrOa > SiOg. All the catalysts were subjected to elemental analysis to exclude any interference from impurities present. The levels of C and Cl~ were always below 0.3%. The C impurity was oxidised during the Oa evolution reaction, producing COg. The level of COa detected m the gas phase was always below 35 /il (1.47 jumol) corresponding to 2.5% of the total Og evolved. Therefore, 1.47 (imol of Oa may be added to all the values presented in the data to get the exact amount of Os produced during the reaction. However, this correction was not made in the data presented, since it was not significant. TIME (h) Pig. 1.

The dispersion of metal oxide on different supports was measured by Hg chemisorption in order to identify its effect on catalytic activity. TiOg- supported catalysts showed a dispersion ofca. 13-14%, whereas on AlgOa the dispersion is ca. 32%. On other supports the dispersion ranged from 13-25% (see discussion below). Based on palladium oxide dispersions, the amount of Oz evolved per mole of Pd exposed was calculated. While on AlgOa-supported catalyst the amount of Og evolved was ~2.3molh~1 (molPd)\"1, on TiOg- supported catalyst this value was 5.9 mol h\"1 mol (Pd)~1. The activity of supported catalysts then fall in the following order: TiOz > Al-sOy > LagOa > ?203 > ZrOz > SiOg. Therefore for all detailed investigations, a TiOz- supported catalyst was used. Since TiOa is photoactive, this material is a better choice for any practical device designed to split water photochemically. Pure PdO and TiOg were used as blanks and no significant Og evolution was noticed during 24 h. The dependence of Oa evolution on palladium oxide loading on TiOg is shown in Fig. 2. The initial rate of Og evolution was 14.1, 15.8 and 20.1 Jumol h\"1 for 2.2%, 4.4% and 7.3% palladium oxide respectively. At 4.4% palladium oxide loading, TiOg would have a 45% monolayer if these particles are dispersed homogeneously and uniformly (BET surface area ofTiOg (P25) is 55 ^^, the radius of Pd^ is 0.5 A and of O2\" is 1.4 A). Loading palladium oxide beyond 4.4% should increase the rate of reaction until the TiOg is covered with a complete monolayer (requiring ca. 9.8% palladium oxide loading). The fact that palladium oxide loading beyond 4.4% continues to increase the rate of reaction does not however provide evidence for a uniform layer of the noble metal oxide. In practice, these oxides seldom 35 spread uniformly on a support to give a monolayer deposition, but tend to form individual particles having a not very high dispersion. As mentioned earlier, the percentage dispersion of palladium oxide on TiOg was between 13-16%. Unfortunately the hydrogen chemisorption technique is not a reliable method to evaluate the dispersion ofPd on a support. Pd is well known for its Ha absorption capability. Therefore during the catalyst pretreatment and the subsequent adsorbing cycles, Pd absorbs considerable quantities of hydrogen. Such experiments should avoid conditions where hydrogen absorption is undesirably large [13-15]. The conditions often require high temperature treatments and low pressure hydrogen absorption cycles. High temperature treatments change the catalytic properties and surface characteristics of the material under study. Hence a better technique for the determination of percentage dispersion ofPd is transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM showed Pd particles with 20 5 A diameter. If a spherical geometry is assumed for Pd particles, this diameter corresponds to ca. 40% metal dispersion. The oxidation states of palladium on these catalysts were determined by XPS [16]. 90% of the Pd atoms were in the +2 oxidation state and 10% in the +4 oxidation state. Therefore the TiOa-supported catalyst may be termed as PdQr/TiOa for the rest of the discussion. The dependence of rate of Oa evolution on the Ce44^ concentration was studied using a 4.4% PdO^/TiOg catalyst. The data is presented in Fig. 3. An increase in the Ce'1\"4 concentration increased the Og evolution rate systemati- cally. A plot of log initial rate us. log [Ce44\"] gave a straight line with slope 1.1, suggesting the reaction is first order with respect to Ce4\"1\" (Fig. 4). 0 5. 0) 10 (0 . 0. eu 0 TIME (h) Fig. 3.

The stoichiometry of the catalytic reaction (eqn. (4)) was checked to establish that the oxygen evolution occurs solely from a single reaction. The UV absorption maximum at 320 nm was used to monitor the Ce4'1\" concentra- tion in the solution before and after the reaction (at 320 nm, e = 5580 M~1 cm\"1). The amount of Og remaining adsorbed on the catalyst surface was also measured separately by stirring 50 mg catalyst for 24 h in a cell containing 20 ml 0.5 M HgSO^ and known amounts of gaseous oxygen. Typically when 50 mg catalyst was allowed to stand in 20 ml of 2.14 x 10~2 M Ce4\"^ solution in 0.5 M HgSO^ for several hours, 15.1/imol of oxygen was evolved. At this oxygen partial pressure the amount of adsorbed Oa would be 0.74^mol. Therefore the total Og produced is equal to 15.84 fzmol. The amount of Ce4\"1' consumed was 64 /imol, in good agreement with reaction stoichiometry of eqn. (4). The % yield of oxygen is calculated as: ,, ^ / >, ^ ^ number of moles Og produced in 24 h , .. % yield of Oa in 24 h = , ^ x 400 number of moles of Ce Typically, for 20 ml of 0.025 M Ce^ solution and 50 mg 4.4% PdO^/TiOa catalyst, a yield of 21% was obtained (24 h). The lifetime of RuOg-based catalysts is generally small [7,17] unless they are suitably pretreated [18]. To check the stability of PdO^/TiOa catalyst, we repeated several reaction cycles on the same catalyst sample, each time introducing fresh Ce4\"1\" solution. The used catalyst was centrifuged and washed five times in triply distilled water before adding fresh Ce4\"^ solution. Approximately 3-5% of catalyst was lost in handling. In spite of this unavoidable loss of catalyst material, the system produced similar amounts of Og on successive runs, showing good stability. The data is 37 TIME (h) Pig. 5.

( ) first run, (A) second run, (13) third run. presented in Fig. 5 for three successive runs. However, at the end of each run and when only 40-50% of Ce4\"*\" had been consumed, the rate of Og evolution had slowed down considerably, as shown in Fig. 1. From the total amount of Og produced after 24 h, an estimate of Ce^ consumed by each catalyst was obtained. This suggests that the rate of reaction decreases probably due to the inhibitive action of Ce3\"1\". A set of experiments was carried out by adding initially known concentrations of Ce3\"'\" to the solution. The amounts of Oz produced for two such Ce^ concentrations are plotted in Fig. 6. Addition of 5 x 10~3 mol Ce34^ to 1 x 10~1 mol Ce4\"1\" slowed the initial rate of reaction by a factor of 13.5 (from 20.2 to 1.5 jumol h~1). For an equimolar mixture of Ce^ and Ce3\"1', the initial rate was only 0.12 /imol h~1. This experiment proves the inhibitive role of Ce34\" on the catalytic activity. However, as shown in this study, continuous recycling of the catalyst is possible by washing out the Ce3\"*\" from the catalyst surface. In a recent paper Mills and Giddings [19] have also shown the inhibitive action exhibited by Ce3\"'\" on RuOg (hydrate) catalysts during water oxidation. The driving force for water oxidation by Ce4\"1\" decreases with increasing Ce3\"'\" concentration according to the Nemst equation: AG (eV) = 4(1.23 -1.44 - 0.059 logtCe^VCCe3^) (5) This might also contribute to the decrease in the water oxidation rate induced by Ce3\"'\". In Fig. 4, for each cycle approximately 40 /imol Oa was produced. In four cycles a minimum turnover number (TN) of 20 is thus achieved if we assume 38 10 15 20 25 TIME (h) Fig. 6.

Since the catalyst was still active after four cycles, this TN can safely be considered as the minimum possible. Conclusion This study shows that palladium oxide when loaded on TiOg, AlgOa, LagOa, NbgOs, etc. serves as a water oxidation catalyst. Unsupported PdO did not show any significant catalytic activity. A palladium oxide supported on TiOg (P25) catalyst was shown to be stable over several successive test runs. This is important, because alternative working catalysts based on RuOg are known to be unstable due to irreversible oxidation to RUU4. Acknowledgements We wish to thank Mr S.

The following test reaction was employed: TiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts functioned most efficiently. It has been shown that palladium oxide (4.4%) supported on TiO2 is very stable, no degradation being observed after 20 turnovers. The reaction was shown to be first order with respect to Ce4+.",
