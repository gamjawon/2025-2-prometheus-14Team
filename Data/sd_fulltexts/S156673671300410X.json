Tel.: +86 22 23503824 (O); fax: +86 22 23502458. By means of spin polarized density functional theory with the GGA+U framework, the reaction mechanism of CH3OH oxidation on the Co3O4 (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces has been investigated. Adsorption situation and a part of reaction cycle for CH3OH oxidation are clarified. Our results indicated that: i) U value can affect the calculated energetic result significantly; ii) CH3OH can adsorb with surface lattice oxygen atom (O2f/O3f) to form CoO bond directly, and the adsorption of CH3OH and its decomposition products on (110)-B is more stable than on (111)-B, which means CH3OH prefers Co3+ better than Co2+; iii) on the (110)-B surface, CH3OH can form CO2, H2O and adsorbed H atom. But on the (111)-B surface, CH3OH can just form formaldehyde (CH2O) and adsorbed H atom, this means oxidative capacity of (110)-B (Co3+) is higher than (111)-B (Co2+). The possible reasons corresponding to the high oxidative of (110)-B come from both Co3+ and O2f: Co3+ tends to bind adsorbed species for further decomposition and O2f tends to bind more hydrogenation atom involved in methanol due to its low-coordinates number compared to that of O3f.

It also plays an important role in the fuel battery. So the study for the oxidation of methanol is of great significance. For decades, a lot of studies focused on the transition metals and metal oxides catalyzed methanol reactions from both experimental and theoretical aspects have been performed [1–9]. Greeley et al. [1] performed a density functional theory (DFT) calculations of methanol decomposition on Pt(111), in which they reported that the methanol decomposition on Pt(111) proceeding via the following three reaction paths: starting from the OH bond scission, and through a series of dehydrogenation to form CO; the CH bond scission occurring firstly, followed by the OH bond scission forming formaldehyde, and dehydrogenation to produce CO; the CH bond scission followed by the second CH bond scission, and the sequential OH/CH bond scission forming CO. The third path plays a leading role under the normal situation, which indicates that for the number of hydrogen and the bond is relatively high, and the different way of bond scission or hydrogen decomposition will lead to different reaction routes. By the research of Mei et al. [7] on the methanol oxidation on stoichiometric CeO2(110) surface, it was found that the OH bond scission is favorable among the CO, CH and OH bonds (namely OH>CO>CH), which is different from the thermodynamic stability for the respective steps (i.e., CH>OH>CO). Due to the unique surface redox and magnetic properties of Co3O4 [10,11], it has been widely used in many heterogeneous reactions such as CO oxidation [12,13], N2O decomposition [14,15], ammonia oxidation [16,17] and hydrogenation oxidation [18,19]. Interestingly, many studies found that the oxidation reaction mechanism strongly depends on the oxidation state of cobalt. Xie et al. [13] found that the Co3O4 nanorods which expose four (110) surface planes that are rich in Co3+ sites had higher reactivity compared to the conventional nanoparticle which exposes mainly the (001) and (111) planes and which contain only inactive Co2+ sites. In the process of ammonia oxidation by cobalt oxide, it was found that its catalytic site is Co3O4 [16]. When Co3O4/CeO2 and Co3O4/CeO2–ZrO2 act as the catalysts in the oxidation of methane, the experimental results showed that the thermal stability of Co3O4/CeO2 and Co3O4/CeO2–ZrO2 stabilizing effect due to the presence of ceria or ceria–zirconia against Co3O4 decomposition into CoO [18]. Similarly, the recent experimental results of Zafeiratos et al. [20] show that the product distribution of methanol oxidation on Co3O4 depends on the oxidation state of cobalt, that is, methanol total oxidation to CO2 and H2O on Co3O4, and partial oxidation to CH2O on CoO. In our previous work [21], we used the DFT calculations to investigate the reaction kinetics of CO oxidation on Co3O4, and the possible reason why (110)-B shows high reactivity than that of (111)-B was gained, i.e. both Co3+ and two coordinates of oxygen atom involved in Co3O4(110)-B contribute to the high catalytic activity towards the CO oxidation. Considering that the Co3O4(110)-B is composed of Co3+ and (111)-B is composed of Co2+ (see Fig. 1 ), so we use (110)-B to model Co3O4 and (111)-B to model CoO in the present work, and to explore the detailed reaction mechanism of methanol oxidation catalyzed by Co3+ and Co2+ by using the DFT calculations. 2 Calculation method and models This study uses the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [22,23] to perform the periodic, self-consistent DFT calculation of methanol oxidation on Co3O4 surface. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [24] was used to calculate the electronic structures. The inner cores were described by the project-augment wave (PAW) scheme [25,26]. The electronic wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis which the kinetic cut-off energy was 400eV. The transition states (TSs) were located by the method of the nudged elastic band (NEB) [27]. In this work, all of the calculations are applied by spin polarization. It is necessary to consider Coulomb (U) and exchange (J) interactions because of the highly correlated electronic states of the cobalt oxide. By considering on-site Coulomb (U) and exchange (J) interactions, the effect of 3d electron correlation can be recovered. In the case of the GGA+U method, the scheme proposed by Dudarev et al. [28] was adopted. Wang et al. [29] studied many oxidation reaction on 3d transition metal oxides with U–J=2.0eV originating from a fit to experimental oxidation energies of cobalt oxides and band gaps. In the present work, we also studied how the (U–J) value affects the adsorption energy of the CH3OH and methoxy (CH3O) on the (110)-B surface. According to the influence of (U–J) on the adsorption energy, and the magnitude of U–J=2.0eV was chosen (see later for detail discussion). The optimized Co3O4 lattice constant is 8.124Å, which is close to the experimental data (i.e. 8.154Å) [30]. A periodic slab model is used to describe the surface. The slab can be obtained by cleaving the bulk in the (110) and (111) directions. The size of the (110) surface unit cell is p(1×1) and it contains five atomic layers. The two uppermost layers are allowed to relax in the process of optimization. For the (111) surface, a p(1×1) unit cell was used. Different from the (110) surface, the (111) surface is unable to be distinguished by the form of layers. In order to make the results reliable, parameter selection is conducted. We chose several values for a parameter and compared their results. Compared the vacuum heights between slabs of 13 and 18Å, the energy difference is found to be no more than 0.02eV. So the vacuum height of 13Å is sufficiently large to exclude the effects from neighboring slab interactions. In the case of the (110) surface, 2×3×1mesh of K-points in the surface Brillouin zone is used. For the (111) surface, the results of adsorption energy on the conditions of 3×3×1mesh and 4×4×1mesh of K-points were compared, and the difference is no more than 0.02eV, so the 3×3×1mesh of K-points in the surface Brillouin zone is enough and suitable for the (111) surface. We used the following formulas to calculate the adsorption energy (E ads) and the activation energy (E a): E ads = E A/M − E A − E M and E a = E TS − E IS, where E A, E M, E A/M, E TS and E IS mean the calculated energy of the adsorbate, substrate, adsorption system, TS and initial state (IS), respectively. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Adsorption of CH3OH and its decomposition species on Co3O4 (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces In this section, we first study the adsorption properties of possible species involved in methanol oxidation on Co3O4, and the calculated adsorption energies as well as the adsorption configurations are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . CH3OH: The adsorption of CH3OH on Co3O4 (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces are investigated in order to determine the most stable IS for the CH3OH adsorption configuration. For the adsorption of methanol on Co3O4 (110)-B, the molecular CH3OH prefers to adsorb on the Co atom with its oxygen atom, and the hydroxyl (-OH) of CH3OH can be close to either O3f or O2f, so there are two ways of adsorption type on (110)-B. In order to distinguish these two adsorption types, these two different adsorption sites are labeled as “OHO3f type” and “OHO2f type”, respectively. On the (110)-B surface, the adsorption of CH3OH is a little more stable in the OHO3f type (−0.63eV) than the OHO2f type (−0.60eV), and thus both the OHO3f type and OHO2f type were taken into account as the stable IS for CH3OH adsorption on (110)-B surface in the following reaction path investigation. On the (111)-B surface, the adsorption energy of CH3OH is −0.54eV, which is a smaller than the OHO2f type of (110)-B. Compared to the (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces, the order of CH3OH adsorption energy in these three cases is (110)-B (OHO3f type)>(110)-B (OHO2f type)>(111)-B. The CoO bond lengths for (110)-B (OHO3f type), (110)-B (OHO2f type) and (111)-B are 2.00, 1.97, and 2.10Å, respectively. The adsorption energy of methanol is relatively weak indicated that the adsorbed methanol is an unstable precursor for further decomposition, which can be easily desorbed at higher temperature. CH3O: For the dissociation of CH3OH on Co3O4, the experimental results confirmed that the methoxy (CH3O) is the dominant dissociated species at the initial stage [5]. Methoxy prefers to adsorb on atop Co site through its oxygen atom and one OCo bond formed accordingly. The CoO bond lengths for (110)-B (OHO3f type), (110)-B (OHO2f type) and (111)-B are 1.77, 1.78, and 1.80Å, respectively. The adsorption energy of methoxy on (110)-B in the OHO3f (−1.83eV) and OHO2f (−1.85eV) type are almost identical, and it is more stable than the adsorption energy of methoxy on (111)-B (-1.69eV). Compared to the adsorption of CH3OH, the adsorption energy of methoxy becomes larger, and the OCo bond length becomes shorter, so it can be supposed that the adsorption of methoxy is stronger than CH3OH. Since the adsorption energy of methoxy is much higher than that of methanol, suggesting that methoxy is stably adsorbed on the surface for further decomposition. It should be noticed that the previous DFT study indicated that the preference adsorption site of methoxy on metals is the FCC site through oxygen atom, in which the CO axis of high symmetry (C 3V) is perpendicular to the metal surface with the methyl group directed away from the surface [1–5], which differs from our present adsorption model that the CO axis is closer to the surface. To clarify whether such configuration is stable as compared to the present adsorption type, an extra calculation based on the configuration where the CO axis in a perpendicular way bound to the metal surface is performed. However, it was found that it is not stable and the CO axis is closer to the substrate surface. The possible reason may due to the existence of surface oxygen atom leading to the interaction between hydrogen atom of methyl and oxygen atom. CH2O: Methoxy (CH3O) decomposes one hydrogen atom and becomes formaldehyde (CH2O). Our calculations indicate that formaldehyde with its oxygen atom binds to atop site of Co on Co3O4, and the CO bond closer to the Co3O4. The adsorption of formaldehyde on (110)-B in the OHO3f type (−0.59eV) is more stable than the OHO2f type (−0.47eV). On the (111)-B surface, the adsorption of formaldehyde (−0.45eV) is similar to the (110)-B of the OHO2f type. The CoO bond lengths for (110)-B (OHO3f type), (110)-B (OHO2f type) and (111)-B are 2.00, 2.01, and 2.07Å separately. Compared to the adsorption of CH3OH, the adsorption energy becomes even smaller and the OCo bond length becomes longer, so the adsorption of formaldehyde is the weakest among methanol, methoxy and formaldehyde. To better understand the possible reason why (110)-B binds methanol more strongly than that of (111)-B, we carried out a charge analysis based on the Bader charge scheme. The calculation result indicated that the net Bader charge of CH3OH is +0.09 and +0.05 e for (110)-B and (111)-B, respectively, indicated more electrons transfer from CH3OH to (110)-B, and thus a relatively higher adsorption energy would be expected on (110-B). Similar case occurred for the adsorption of CH2O (i.e., +0.05 e on (110)-B and 0.01 e on (111)-B). However, for the case of CH3O, the CH3O species is negative charged, and the related charge is −0.32 and −0.38 e on (110)-B and (111)-B, respectively. 3.1.1 The effect of U–J value on the adsorption energy How does U–J value influence the calculation energetics? The variations of CH3OH and CH3O adsorption energy with the change of U–J are shown in Fig. 3. Six points are taken in the range from 0.00 to 5.00eV in U value, and J value is taken to be 0.1∗ U. In Fig. 3 one can know that the CH3OH adsorption energy strongly depends on the value of U–J. In the range of 0.90 to 2.70eV of U–J value, it is found that the absolute values or the trend of the CH3OH adsorption energy keep stable relatively. For the case of CH3O, when U–J value is in the range of 0.00 to 2.70eV, the adsorption energy keeps relative stable. So we consider the choice of U–J value should locate in this range. According to some experiences of previous literature, the U–J is set to be a reasonable value of 2.00eV in this work (Fig. 3 ). 3.2 CH3OH oxidation on Co3O4 (110)-B surface After getting the most stable adsorption configurations for the each species related to methanol decomposition on Co3O4, the possible reaction routes were explored based on the NEB method, and we therefore construct a best route for the oxidation on Co3O4(110)-B surface. The energy profiles and some key configurations are shown by Figs. 4 and 5 . Detailed comparison of the CH3OH oxidation route on (110)-B is discussed in the following. 3.2.1 Methanol decomposes two hydrogen atoms and forms formaldehyde: CH3OH=CH2O+2H As we aforementioned, there are two adsorption types of CH3OH, which are OHO3f and OHO2f type. We discuss the reactions starting from these two ISs. 3.2.1.1 Starting from the adsorption type of OHO2f In the adsorption way of the OHO2f type, there are two cases for the first decomposition hydrogen atom of CH3OH onto the lattice oxygen, and they are called to be (A) and (B). The first (A) is the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl (OH) decomposes onto the O2f site [CH3OH(Co3+ ) = CH3O(Co3+ ) + H(O2f )], and the activation energy of this process is 0.29eV. When the second hydrogen atom involved in methoxy (CH3O) decomposes onto the O3f site [CH3O(Co3+ ) = CH2O(Co3+ ) + H(O3f )], the activation energy (ca. 0.97eV) is too large for the reaction proceeding. The second (B) is the hydrogen atom of methyl (the α-H of CH3OH) that decomposes onto the O3f site.Along with the decomposition of the hydrogen atom of methyl, it is found that the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl is also decomposed onto the O2f site simultaneously [CH3OH(Co3+ ) = CH2O(Co3+ ) + H(O3f ) + H(O2f )], and the activation energy (>1.00eV) is much larger than the case of the first (A) way. So both (A) and (B) cannot take place efficiently and we ignore the mechanism of the OH O2f type. 3.2.1.2 Starting from the adsorption type of OHO3f Different from the case of OHO2f type, the adsorption type of OHO3f can ensure a better progress than the OHO2f type. Same as the case of OHO2f type, the first decomposition hydrogen atom of CH3OH onto the lattice oxygen in the OHO3f type can be also divided into two cases: (A) and (B). The case of (B) is that the hydrogen atom of the methyl (the α-H of CH3OH) decomposes onto the O2f site [CH3OH(Co3+ ) = CH2OH(Co3+ ) + H(O2f )], the activation energy (1.20eV) is too large. However, in the case of (A), the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl (OH) decomposes onto the O3f site [CH3OH(Co3+ ) = CH3O(Co3+ ) + H(O3f )], and the activation energy (0.22eV) is a little lower than the case of the OHO2f type (0.29eV) (see A-1→A-2(TS)→A-3 in Figs. 4 and 5). As the second hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atom of methoxy (CH3O) decomposes onto the O2f site [CH3O(Co3+ ) = CH2O(Co3+ ) + H(O2f )], the activation energy is 0.51eV, which is lower than the decomposition of the second hydrogen atom processes of the OHO2f type (see A-3→A-4(TS)→A-5 in Figs. 4 and 5). So the (A) case of OHO3f type is the best way at the beginning of the reaction route. 3.2.2 The following steps of the decomposition of formaldehyde starting from the OHO3f type According to the above comparison, the whole reaction route starts from the adsorption type of OHO3f is more reasonable. After the decomposition of the first and second hydrogen discussed above, the third hydrogen atom which is the hydrogen atom of formaldehyde (CH2O) decomposes onto the O2f site, and the previous hydrogen atom adsorbed on the O2f site migrates to the neighbor O2f site. These two processes happen simultaneously [CH2O(Co 3+ ) + O2f − Hpre + O2f = CHO(Co 3+ ) + O2f − H + O2f − Hpre ], and the activation energy is 0.97eV (see A-5→A-6(TS)→A-7 in Figs. 4 and 5). Due to the migration of hydrogen atom, O2f still plays a key role in the processes of the oxidation essentially, not the O2f Hpre. After the decomposition of the third hydrogen atom and the formyl (CHO) formed. Since the OCo bond length is rather long (2.16Å), the formyl is not stable at this configuration and will rotate clockwise in the view of A-7→A-8 as seen in Fig. 5 and to form a CCo bond. The bond length is 1.93Å. This process is exothermic (−1.37eV) and no activation energy is found. After the formation of the CCo bond, the hydrogen atom of the formyl (CHO) becomes close to the O2f site. Another way of rotation is the counterclockwise rotation in the view of A-7 of Fig. 5 and the hydrogen atom of the formyl (CHO) becomes close to the O3f site. Although this process is exothermic, the rotation angle is bigger than the clockwise way, and the subsequent reaction is not as efficient as the clockwise way. So the following discussion is based on the configuration of the clockwise rotation. In order to form CO, the only one hydrogen atom of formyl (CHO) continues to decompose onto the O2f site. Then there are two hydrogen atoms adsorb on one O2f atom and it becomes an adsorbed water H2(O2f ) [CHO(Co3+ ) + H(O2f ) = CO(Co3+ ) + H2(O2f )]. The activation energy of this process is 0.84eV (see A-8→A-9(TS)→A-10). The H2O(2f) needs 0.68eV to desorb from the surface, followed by the formation of an O2f vacancy (V2f ) [H2(O2f) = H2O + V2f] (see A-10→A-11(TS)→A-12). One O2 molecule can be absorbed and fill the vacancy [V2f + O2 = O(O2f)]. This reaction is exothermic (−1.28eV) (see A-12→A-13). The generated configuration is not conducive for the formation of CO2, so the two oxygen atoms migrate to a reasonable configuration (activation energy: 0.58eV) (see A-13→A-14(TS)→A-15). The nearest oxygen atom reacts with the CO and forms CO2 (activation energy: 1.03eV) [CO(Co3+ ) + O(O2f) = CO2 ]. The reaction is exothermic (−3.31eV) (see A-15→A-16(TS)→A-17). So on (110)-B surface, CH3OH can be completely oxidized to CO2, H2O and adsorbed hydrogen atom, and the RDS (rate-determining step) is the formation of CO2 (energy barrier is 1.03eV). 3.3 CH3OH oxidation on Co3O4 (111)-B surface Similar to the situation of methanol oxidation on (110)-B, there are also two cases: (A) and (B), for the first decomposition hydrogen atom of CH3OH onto the lattice oxygen. Case (B) is the hydrogen atom of methyl (the α-H of CH3OH) onto the lattice oxygen (O3f) [CH3OH(Co2+ ) = CH2OH(Co2+ ) + H(O3f )], the activation energy is found to be very high (1.16eV). If the first decomposed hydrogen atom is the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl (OH) by case (A) [CH3OH(Co2+ ) = CH3O(Co2+ ) + H(O3f )], the activation energy is rather small (0.20eV) (see B-1→B-2(TS)→B-3 in Figs. 6 and 7 ). So the reasonable first decomposed hydrogen atom should be the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl (OH) by case (A). Considering the result of the two cases of OHO2f and OHO3f type on (110)-B surface, the first hydrogen atom decomposed from the CH3OH all tends to be the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl (OH) on both (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces. This may probably due to the closer of OH bond to the surface oxygen atom (either O3f or O2f) compared to that of CH. The second hydrogen atom can decompose onto the lattice oxygen (O3f), and forms adsorbed formaldehyde (CH2O) [CH3O(Co2+ ) = CH2O(Co2+ ) + H(O3f )]. The activation energy is rather large (1.37eV) (see B-3→B-4(TS)→B-5 in Figs. 6 and 7). Once formaldehyde formed, it can further decompose to produce CHO. However, we notice that this process is a strong endothermic process (as high as 0.70eV), and the associated energy barrier is 1.78eV (see B-5→B-6(TS)→B-7). So it is reasonable to conclude that the methanol oxidation on Co3O4(111)-B surface would stop at the formation of CH2O, and it agrees with the results of Sakong et al. [4]. The RDS is CH3O that decomposes to CH2O (activation energy is 1.37eV). 3.4 The comparison of Co3O4(110)-B and (111)-B surfaces The results discussed above show that the oxidation of CH3OH depends on the surface structure of Co3O4. For the adsorption of species, the stability of CH3OH, CH3O and CH2O on (110)-B surface is higher than on (111)-B surface, so the adsorption ability of Co3+ is better than Co2+. The strong adsorption ability of Co3+ on (110)-B surface can stabilize each species forming during the reaction processes, which conduces to the deepening of the reaction. For (110)-B surface, CH3OH can be completely oxidized to CO2, H2O and adsorbed hydrogen atom, while on (111)-B surface CH3OH can be partially oxidized to CH2O and adsorbed hydrogen atom. This indicates that the oxidative capacity of (110)-B surface which contains only Co3+ is stronger than (111)-B surface which contains only Co2+. Our results agree well with the conclusion of Zafeiratos et al. [20] that the oxidative capacity relates to the oxidation state of Co: Co3O4 which contains Co3+ and Co2+ can completely oxidize CH3OH to H2O and CO2, while CoO which only contains Co2+ can partially oxidize CH3OH to CH2O. Besides, the coordination number of the O2f on (110)-B surface is lower than O3f, and it binds with Co more weakly. So O2f can bind with two hydrogen atoms to form water, which can desorb from the surface easily. Therefore, the presence of O2f on (110)-B surface is one another reason for higher oxidative capacity of (110)-B than (111)-B surface. O2f and Co3+ are both the active sites which contribute to the oxidative capacity for methanol oxidation on Co3O4 surface. The formatted CHO on (110)-B surface can become more stable by the rotation of configuration, and the energy of the system becomes lower, which will be conducive to the further reaction. The activation energy for the RDS of the route on (110)-B surface is 1.03eV, which is lower than on (111)-B (1.37eV). So for CH3OH oxidation on Co3O4 surface, the activity of Co3+ is higher than Co2+, and (110)-B surface has a better activity than (111)-B surface in the view of both oxidative capacity and reaction barrier. 3.5 Methanol coverage on the reaction energetic of methanol decomposition on Co3O4(110)-B It is important to study the coverage effect on the reaction energetic of methanol decomposition, and here we study the situation of two methanol molecules adsorbed on (110)-B surface (denoted as high methanol coverages here). First we give the results of methanol adsorption properties at high methanol coverages. On (110)-B surface, when two CH3OH co-adsorbed, the adsorption of CH3OH is found to be −0.68eV, close to the case where only one CH3OH molecule adsorbed on (110) surface (−0.63eV). The reason is clear due to the relatively open of (110)-B surface and the long distance between the two Co3+ atoms (~4.99Å): on the one hand, the hydrogen bond between two CH3OH molecules cannot be formed efficiently; on the other hand, the repulsive interaction of two CH3OH molecules is small. This is different from the situation of methanol adsorption on Pt(111) [2]. Since the small distance between Pt–Pt (~2.82Å), and a hydrogen bond even formed at the relatively low coverage (i.e. 1/4 ML). After getting the stable adsorption configuration of two methanol molecules, then the reaction network from CH3OH to CO was built (see Figs. 8 and 9 ), in which one CH3OH molecule acts as the reactant, and the other CH3OH molecule act as spectator. As the weaker interaction between CH3OH molecules, the calculated energetic at high CH3OH coverages is close to that at low coverages (i.e. one CH3OH molecule on Co3O4(110)-B surface), indicating a little effect of CH3OH coverage on the calculation results. 4 Conclusions The results of the calculation show that the selection of U value is very important, it should be controlled in a reasonable range, and an excessive U value will cause a deviated calculation result. Methanol and its decomposed species adsorbed on Co3+ of (110)-B surface and Co2+ of (111)-B surface, forming OCo bond, and the adsorption on (110)-B surface is more stable than on (111)-B surface, which means the adsorption on Co3+ is more stable than on Co2+. The oxidation extent of (110)-B surface is higher than (111)-B surface: on (110)-B surface, methanol can be oxidized to CO2, H2O and adsorbed hydrogen atom. But on (111)-B surface, methanol can only be oxidized to CH2O and adsorbed hydrogen atom. On both (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces, there are different reaction routes for the oxidation of CH3OH, and both of the two surfaces exist a most favorable route starting from the OH bond scission. The overall activation energy on (110)-B surface is lower than on (111)-B surface. Therefore, the activity of (110)-B surface which contains Co3+ and O2f is better than (111)-B which contains Co2+. Both Co3+ and O2f are the active sites for CH3OH oxidation on Co3O4 surface. Moreover, it was found that the methanol coverage has a little effect on the reaction energetic due to the relatively open of (110)-B surface.

        "dc:description": "By means of spin polarized density functional theory with the GGA+U framework, the reaction mechanism of CH3OH oxidation on the Co3O4 (110)-B and (111)-B surfaces has been investigated. Adsorption situation and a part of reaction cycle for CH3OH oxidation are clarified. Our results indicated that: i) U value can affect the calculated energetic result significantly; ii) CH3OH can adsorb with surface lattice oxygen atom (O2f/O3f) to form CoO bond directly, and the adsorption of CH3OH and its decomposition products on (110)-B is more stable than on (111)-B, which means CH3OH prefers Co3+ better than Co2+; iii) on the (110)-B surface, CH3OH can form CO2, H2O and adsorbed H atom. But on the (111)-B surface, CH3OH can just form formaldehyde (CH2O) and adsorbed H atom, this means oxidative capacity of (110)-B (Co3+) is higher than (111)-B (Co2+). The possible reasons corresponding to the high oxidative of (110)-B come from both Co3+ and O2f: Co3+ tends to bind adsorbed species for further decomposition and O2f tends to bind more hydrogenation atom involved in methanol due to its low-coordinates number compared to that of O3f.",
