Graphical abstract The internal donors in supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts form several types of complexes on surface of MgCl2 support. A part of the internal donors is removed from the catalysts at interaction of the catalysts with AlEt3 cocatalyst. IR spectroscopy of diffuse reflection (DRIFTS) was used to study the interaction of the support EB/MgCl2 and the catalysts TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 (where EB—ethyl benzoate) with AlEt3 cocatalyst. DRIFT spectra of the EB adsorbed on the surface of MgCl2 support (before (A) and after (B) interaction with AlEt3) demonstrating effect of AlEt3 on the distribution of EB complexes on MgCl2 surface. The interaction of AlEt3 cocatalyst with the internal donor (ethyl benzoate–EB) in the supported Ziegler–Natta (TiCl4/EB/MgCl2) catalysts and the EB/MgCl2 support was studied by DRIFT spectroscopy. For EB/MgCl2 samples, it was shown that AlEt3 firstly removed the more weak surface complexes of EB from the MgCl2 surface and competed with EB at adsorbtion for releasing sites of the MgCl2 surface. EB, as the external donor, keeps constant the initial content and distribution of surface complexes of EB at the interaction of the AlEt3/EB mixture with the EB/MgCl2 support. At the interaction of AlEt3 with the TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 catalysts one type of surface complexes of EB is mainly removed. A part of removed EB adsorbs again on the catalyst surface in the form of complexes with aluminum-containing compounds. At the interaction of the catalyst with the AlEt3/EB mixture the EB content in the catalyst changes slightly, but the distribution of different surface complexes of EB in the catalyst changes noticeably compared to that in the initial catalyst. EB, as the external donor, adsorbs both on surface MgCl2 sites released at the removal of the internal donor and on aluminum-containing compounds adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Keywords Ziegler–Natta catalysts Internal donor MgCl2 support DRIFT spectroscopy 1 Introduction The introduction of the Lewis bases (“internal donors”) into supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts greatly influences the performance of these catalysts in propene polymerization, especially the stereospecificity of the catalysts [1]. The internal donor (ID) in catalysts of the TiCl4/ID/MgCl2 composition provides high stereospecificity above 95% at short polymerization time [2,3]. However, with the increase of polymerization time a part of the internal donor is removed from the catalysts as the result of the interaction of the catalysts with cocatalyst (aluminum trialkyl) [2–8]. The removal of a part of the internal donor from the catalysts is accompanied by drastic decrease of stereospecificity of the catalysts. A decrease of stereospecificity of the catalysts results in a decrease of yield of isotactic polymer and in an increase of portion of atactic polymer [2]. A part of the internal donor remains in the catalysts and, possibly, owing to that the stereospecificity of the catalysts exceed the stereospecificity of the catalyst with the composition of TiCl4/MgCl2, which does not contain the internal donor initially [3]. To keep high stereospecificity of the catalysts, external donors are introduced in polymerization medium. The external donors adsorb on the surface of the catalysts, for example [1,9], and thereby keep high stereospecificity of the catalysts. We have earlier shown that surface complexes formed at the interaction of carbonyl groups of the internal donors with highly dispersed support MgCl2 in samples ID/MgCl2 and TiCl4/ID/MgCl2 catalysts (where ID=ethyl benzoate or di-n-butyl phthalate) can be characterized by IR spectroscopy of diffuse reflection (DRIFTS) by position of absorbtion bands of carbonyl groups in IR spectra [10]. It was found that the internal donors form several types of complexes with low-coordinated Mg ions on the support surface. A part of these complexes was removed by TiCl4 at preparation of the catalysts, with TiCl4 having adsorbed on the support surface instead of removed donors. The use of DRIFT spectroscopy allowed us to determine what surface sites were occupied by main part of adsorbed TiCl4 [10]. In the present work we used DRIFTS to study the interaction of the support EB/MgCl2 and the TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 catalysts with AlEt3 cocatalyst. Two types of the catalysts were investigated: (i) the catalyst prepared by the interaction of TiCl4 and EB with highly dispersed MgCl2; (ii) the catalyst prepared by the interaction of TiCl4 and EB with Mg(OEt)2. In the last the formation of the support (MgCl2) takes place during the catalyst preparation via chlorination of Mg(OEt)2 by TiCl4. The first catalyst is, to a greater extent, a model catalyst. While the second one, by the way of preparation, corresponds to modern supported catalysts. The use of these two catalysts allows us to extend the data for model samples to real catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Heptane, n-butylchloride, chlorobenzene (PhCl), EB were used after dehydration over molecular sieves. All the preparation and manipulation with samples were performed under argon atmosphere. Argon gas was additionally dried with molecular sieves and a Drierite gas drying unit with anhydrous calcium sulfate. 2.2 Support The highly dispersed MgCl2 support was prepared via interaction of magnesium metal powder with C4H9Cl (molar ratio C4H9Cl/Mg=3) in heptane at 98°C with subsequent washing with heptane. The resulting MgCl2 support contained ca. 5wt.% of organic residue and had a surface area of ca. 100m2/g. 2.3 Preparation of samples The EB/MgCl2 sample (3.6wt.% or 250μmol of EB per gram of MgCl2) was prepared by adding EB to a suspension of MgCl2 (EB/MgCl2 =0.1) in PhCl (25ml/g of MgCl2) at 105°C and keeping the reaction mixture at this temperature for 1h. The resulted sample was washed once with PhCl at 105°C and twice with heptane. Titanium–magnesium catalyst (I) with a composition of TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 (0.77wt.% of Ti (170μmol/g MgCl2), 1.5wt.% of EB (105μmol/g MgCl2)) was prepared via treatment of the highly dispersed MgCl2 support with a mixture of TiCl4/PhCl (1:1vol., Ti/Mg=10) in the presence of EB (EB/Mg=0.1) at 105°C for 1h and followed by two treatments with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture at 105°C for 0.5h. Titanium–magnesium catalyst (II) with a composition of TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 (2.4wt.% of Ti (615μmol/g MgCl2), 9.2wt.% of EB (755μmol/g MgCl2)) was prepared via treatment of Mg(OEt)2 (Aldrich grade) with a mixture of TiCl4/PhCl (1:1vol., Ti/Mg=10) in the presence of EB (EB/Mg=0.3) at 105°C for 1h and followed by one treatment with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture in the presence of EB (EB/Mg=0.2) at 105°C for 0.5h and one treatment with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture at 105°C for 0.5h. All the catalysts were washed once with PhCl and three times with heptane. 2.4 Treatment of the samples with AlEt3 The EB/MgCl2 sample was treated with AlEt3 in heptane at [AlEt3]=7.5mmol/l and Al/EB molar ratio of 7.5 for 0.5h at 50°C and followed by two washings with heptane. The catalyst (I) was treated with AlEt3 in heptane at [AlEt3]=7.5mmol/l and Al/Ti molar ratio of 7.5 for 0.5h at 50°C and followed by two washings with heptane. The catalyst (II) was treated with AlEt3 in heptane at [AlEt3]=7.5mmol/l and Al/Ti molar ratio of 20 for 0.5h at 50°C in the presence or absence of the external donor (EB at AlEt3/EB=3) and followed by two washings with heptane. 2.5 Chemical analysis Titanium and aluminum content in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The content of EB was determined by reverse phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography. 2.6 DRIFT spectroscopy The DRIFT spectra of dried samples were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400 spectrometer equipped with a dry nitrogen chamber and sealed cells with CaF2 windows. All spectra were recorded with a nominal resolution of 4cm−1. 3 Results and discussion Using the set of the EB/MgCl2 samples differed by EB content in a number of cases more than 50 times and for TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 catalyst we have earlier proposed the positions of ν(CO) of carbonyl groups of EB in its individual complexes on the surface of highly dispersed MgCl2: 1645, 1675 and 1695cm−1 [10]. All the experimental spectra of carbonyl groups were well described by the number of Gaussian functions with the mentioned set of ν(CO) frequencies. Quite recently it was asserted in [11] that bands of ν(CO) of esters observed in IR spectra of titanium–magnesium catalyst with bands position close to 1650cm−1 have been arisen from complexes of esters and TiCl4 only. Simultaneously, if these bands are present in IR spectra of ester/MgCl2 samples, they are the result of contamination of these samples by water [11]. This assertion forced us to make short preface and additional contribution to our present work. To avoid ambiguity at the interpretation of the data of our present work, we firstly discuss the origin of low-frequency bands observed in IR spectra in the range of ν(CO) bands. Fig. 1 shows the examples of DRIFT spectra of highly dispersed MgCl2. Sometimes traces of water can be present in the sample. The water has the following appearance in the spectra (Fig. 1A): the band at 1613cm−1 arising from δ(HOH) of adsorbed H2O, corresponding overtones at 3200cm−1, ν(OH) of H2O and hydroxyls in the range of 3200–3700cm−1. The band of δ(HOH) at 1613cm−1 is well described by Gaussian function. Fig. 1A and B shows the changes of DRIFT spectrum at washing of the MgCl2 with heptane from which not all water had been removed by drying. At this case the drastic increase of δ(HOH) is observed (Fig. 1B). The band position shifts slightly from 1613 to 1618cm−1. The shape of the band does not change. The intensities of ν(OH) in the range of 3200–3700cm−1 increase proportionally to the increase of the intensity of δ(HOH). So, the presence of H2O does not produce additional bands around 1650cm−1, which were orally mentioned in [11]. Fig. 2 shows the example of appearance of δ(HOH) band in the spectra of titanium–magnesium catalysts containing esters as the internal donors. It is seen that a weak band of δ(HOH) at 1613cm−1 is present near to the duplet of phenyl ring (Fig. 2B) as compared with a catalyst without marked demonstration of H2O (Fig. 2A). On the whole, the same influence of H2O on IR spectra of supported titanium–magnesium catalysts was shown a long time ago [12]. So, the bands at ca. 1650cm−1 present in IR spectra of esters adsorbed on the surface of MgCl2 belong unambiguously to ν(CO) bands of esters in complexes of esters and MgCl2. 3.1 Interaction of the EB-containing support with AlEt3 It was firstly studied the interaction of AlEt3 with the EB/MgCl2 sample obtained by the treatment of highly dispersed MgCl2 with EB in chlorobenzene medium. The state of EB in such a sample has been earlier studied by DRIFT spectroscopy [10]. Fig. 3A shows the DRIFT spectrum of the EB/MgCl2 sample (Table 1 , sample 1) in the range of the ν(CO). It has been earlier shown via computer-assisted deconvolution of the DRIFT spectrum of such sample that EB forms several types of surface complexes [10]. These complexes (Table 1, sample 1) correspond to complexes of EB with surface-exposed Mg ions in different chlorine coordination, for example, with 3, 4 or 5 chlorine atoms at Mg ion (complexes Q3, Q4 and Q5, correspondingly). It is believed that more strong complexes Q3 and Q4 correspond to ν(CO) in the range of low frequencies (1645 and 1675cm−1) [10]. It is possible also that EB is able to form at one of the MgCl2 faces complexes of different stehiometry with respect to surface-exposed Mg ions. About half the complexes of EB (46%) are in the form of Q4 complexes and 20% of EB are in the form of more weak (Q5) and more strong (Q3) complexes (sample 1, Table 1). At the interaction of the EB/MgCl2 sample with AlEt3 the half of EB (130μmol/g) is removed and surface complexes of AlEt3 (120μmol/g) are formed (Table 1, sample 2). As Table 1 shows, the total amount of surface EB and Al compounds does not practically change. Note, that in the absence of EB the interaction of AlEt3 with similar MgCl2 support resulted in formation of surface complexes of AlEt3 in close to EB quantities (250μmol/g) [13]. So, at the interaction with EB/MgCl2 sample AlEt3 occupies coordination sites at MgCl2 surface available after removal of a part of EB. As the data of Table 1 (samples 1 and 2) and Fig. 3 show, these sites mainly appear owing to the removal of Q5 complexes and loosely coordinated EB characterized by ν(CO) above 1700cm−1. As the result, sample 2 contains EB in the form of Q3 and Q4 complexes only (sample 2, Fig. 3B). Sample 3 obtained at the interaction of sample 1 with AlEt3/EB mixture (EB as the external donor at AlEt3/EB=3) contains the same quantity of EB practically as sample 1. Adsorbtion of AlEt3 is small in this case. DRIFT spectra of samples 3 and 1 are very similar (Fig. 4 ), and, as the data of Table 1 show (sample 3), the distribution of different EB complexes does not change practically compared to sample 1. So, it is possible to believe, if the removal of EB from the MgCl2 surface takes place, then EB from the solution occupies its places and keeps the initial distribution of EB complexes on the MgCl2 surface. Data obtained after the interaction of MgCl2 support with the mixture of AlEt3 and EB (AlEt3/EB=3) (sample 4) show that the formation of MgCl2 complexes with EB is more preferable than with AlEt3, in spite of threefold excess of AlEt3 with respect to EB. As Fig. 4 and the data of Table 1 (sample 4) show, the portion of more strong complexes Q3 increases in sample 4 compared to samples 1–3. Thus, the data obtained show that AlEt3 can remove considerable part of more weak complexes of EB from the MgCl2 surface and does not remove EB, from formal point of view, with the use of AlEt3/EB mixture (AlEt3/EB=3). 3.2 Interaction of catalysts with AlEt3 The data on the EB and Ti content and the distribution of different complexes of EB in catalyst (I) are shown in Table 1 (sample 5). DRIFT spectrum of this catalyst is presented in Fig. 5 . In spite of great excess of TiCl4 at the catalyst preparation (TiCl4/EB=100), considerable amounts of EB complexes (105μmol/g) form on the MgCl2 surface besides the adsorbtion of TiCl4. These complexes are formed as the complexes Q3 and Q4 with more acidic sites of the MgCl2 surface. The rest adsorbtion sites of MgCl2 are obviously occupied by TiCl4. The sum of EB and TiCl4 in catalyst (I) (275μmol/g) is close to the content of adsorbtion sites of the initial MgCl2 support with respect to EB adsorbtion (250μmol/g, sample 1). When interacting with AlEt3 (sample 6), the content of EB in catalyst (I) decreases (by three times). The content of titanium decreases to a lesser extent (by 15% only). At the same time, considerable amounts of aluminum-containing compounds adsorb on the catalyst surface. The total number of surface species (EB, titanium and aluminum compounds) markedly exceeds the sum of EB and TiCl4 in the initial catalyst (I). This can indicate on the formation of additional sites in catalyst (I) available for adsorbtion of aluminum compounds, for example, surface compounds of titanium. Probably, aluminum compounds adsorb both MgCl2 and titanium chlorides. The interaction of the catalyst (I) with AlEt3 changes the spectrum of ν(CO) of EB (Fig. 5). The main part of EB is in the form of complexes Q3 in sample 6, unlike the initial sample 5. Qualitative changes of the spectrum in the region of absorbtion bands of phenyl ring are observed too (Fig. 5); the new band appears at ca. 1573cm−1. We suppose that the appearance of this band points to the formation of EB complexes with AlEt2Cl. Indeed, AlEt2Cl, as a product of AlEt3 interaction with TiCl4, is the main surface compound of alumina in the catalysts [15], and a part of AlEt2Cl present on the catalyst surface can adsorb electron-donor compounds [13]. According to the literature data [14], a low-frequency band at ca. 1580cm−1 appears at the formation of EB complexes with AlEt2Cl. At that, the ν(CO) band of EB appears at ca. 1644cm−1. This is close to the ν(CO) frequency (ca. 1645cm−1) of EB in Q3 complexes on MgCl2 surface. So, a part of Q3 complexes contains EB complexes with AlEt2Cl. Apparently, a part of EB removed from the MgCl2 surface of catalyst (I) can adsorb again on new more acidic sites of the catalyst and produce the EB complexes with ν(CO) corresponding to Q3 complexes. The data on the interaction of AlEt3 with catalyst (II) are presented in Table 1 (samples 7–9) and Figs. 6 and 7 . The amount of EB and TiCl4 is significantly higher in catalyst (II) than in catalyst (I) (Table 1, samples 7 and 5). This is a result of that the surface area of catalyst (II) prepared from Mg(OEt)2 is essentially higher (about 300m2/g) than the surface area of catalyst (I) prepared with the use of the MgCl2 support of relatively low surface area (about 100m2/g). Besides, the ratio EB/TiCl4 is markedly higher in catalyst (II) than that in catalyst (I) (1.2 instead of 0.6, correspondingly). The differences of the chemical composition and surface area of catalysts (I) and (II) does not influence the distribution of surface complexes of EB practically. The main part of surface complexes of EB is in the form of complexes Q4 (72%) in catalyst (II) as in catalyst (I). It means that EB in the presence of TiCl4 interacts with one type of surface-exposed Mg ions mainly. At the same time, the set of different types of surface complexes of EB is similar for both the catalysts and the MgCl2 support used in the study. That is, at formation of MgCl2 during the preparation of catalyst (II), the same set of lateral faces of MgCl2 is formed as for the MgCl2 support. Indeed, as it was recently shown in [16], the presence of EB at the formation of MgCl2 from Mg-containing support resulted in the formation of two basic types of lateral faces of MgCl2 characterizing by different low-coordinated surface-exposed Mg ions. The formation of the (110) face with 4-coordinated Mg ions in the presence of EB indicates the directional interaction of EB with this face of MgCl2. That submits completely to our data on predominant formation of one type of EB complexes (Q4) in the catalysts. At the interaction of catalyst (II) with AlEt3, about half EB is removed; the titanium content decreases too, and surface complexes of aluminum compounds are formed (sample 8). The total number of surface species (EB, titanium and aluminum compounds) is equal to the sum of EB and TiCl4 in the initial catalyst (II), in contrast to that in catalyst (I). As the data of DRIFT spectroscopy show (Fig. 6), the portion of more strong EB complexes (Q3) increases markedly after the treatment of catalyst (II) by AlEt3. The total amount of these complexes increases too as compared with the initial catalyst (Table 1, samples 7 and 8). The reason seems to be the formation of new EB complexes with new adsorbtion sites (AlEt2Cl) on the catalyst surface. In favour of that, similarly to the case of sample 6, the fact of appearance in DRIFT spectrum of band at 1573cm−1 indicates. This band, as before for sample 6, can be assigned to the complexes of EB with AlEt2Cl formed in catalyst (II). Note, the amount of Q3 complexes does not increase at the treatment of catalyst (I) by AlEt3 (sample 6). We suppose that it is due to higher AlEt3/EB ratio (2 times) at the treatment of catalyst (I) with AlEt3 (as a result of constant AlEt3/Ti ratio for both catalysts, but different EB/Ti ratios). So, in the case of catalyst (I), a removal of different EB complexes from the catalyst surface seems to proceeds to a greater extent than that with catalyst (II). The interaction of catalyst (II) with AlEt3 in the presence of EB as the external donor (AlEt3/EB=3) results in the minor decrease of the EB amount in the catalyst (sample 9 compared to sample 7). The EB amount is higher and the aluminum amount is lower in sample 9 than those in sample 8 prepared by the interaction of catalyst (II) with alone AlEt3. The tendency of change of the EB and aluminum amount in samples 8 and 9 corresponds to that in samples 2 and 3 obtained by the interaction of sample 1 (EB/MgCl2) with alone AlEt3 or AlEt3/EB mixture, correspondingly. The distribution of the EB complexes in sample 9 changes markedly compared to catalyst (II), that has not happened earlier at the interaction of sample 1 with the AlEt3/EB mixture (sample 3). The changes happened with sample 9, as compared with the initial catalyst (II), indicate that chlorine-containing aluminum compounds formed at the interaction of catalyst (II) with AlEt3 participate noticeably in the distribution of different complexes of EB. In the case of sample 9, the marked decrease of the amount of the Q4 complexes and the increase of the amount of the Q5 and Q3 complexes are observed (Fig. 7, Table 1). The amount of more strong complexes of EB (Q3) increases as in sample 8. At that a part of these complexes, as it was noted for sample 8, is probably in the form of EB complexes with chlorine-containing aluminum compounds. That is indicated by the presence of absorbtion band at 1573cm−1 in DRIFT spectrum (Fig. 7). 4 Conclusion For EB/MgCl2 samples, it was shown that AlEt3 cocatalyst firstly removed the more weak complexes of EB (Q5 and weakly bound EB) from the MgCl2 surface (ca. 50% of EB) and bound with the released surface sites of MgCl2. The addition of EB as the external donor to AlEt3 keeps constant the initial content and the distribution of surface complexes of EB at the interaction of the EB/MgCl2 sample with the AlEt3/EB mixture. The interaction of AlEt3 with the TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 catalysts results mainly in the removal of the Q4 complexes of EB, a part of the removed EB adsorbing again on catalyst surface, probably, in the form of complexes with aluminum compounds. At the interaction of the AlEt3/EB mixture with the TiCl4/EB/MgCl2 catalyst the total amount of EB changes slightly, but the ratio between different types of surface EB complexes changes noticeably with increasing the portions of weak (Q5) and more strong (Q3) complexes of EB. EB as the external donor adsorbs both on the sites released at the removal of the internal donor and aluminum-containing compounds adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The model catalyst prepared with the use of highly dispersed MgCl2 and the real catalyst prepared with the use of Mg(OEt)2 show similar changes of their composition at the interaction with AlEt3 cocatalyst. For both the catalysts, AlEt3 cocatalyst mainly removes one type of surface complexes of EB, and a part of removed EB adsorbs again on the surface of the catalysts. So, the data obtained for the model catalyst and highly dispersed MgCl2 support directly demonstrate the processes taking place on the surface of real supported catalysts at their interaction with cocatalyst and an external donor.
