Graphical abstract The potential of Fe-doped penta-graphene (Fe–PG) as a catalyst for reduction of NO by CO is investigated by a Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. The results of adsorption energy, charge transfer and partial density of states (PDOS) indicate that the adsorption of NO on the surface is stronger than that of CO. The direct dissociation of NO is barely possible to occur because the dissociation of NO has a very high activation energy of 5.38 eV. The structure of adsorbed (NO)2 dimers is discovered on the surface, which initiates the reaction described by the dimer mechanism. (NO)2 dimers dissociate into a N2O molecule and an Oads atom over a relatively small activation energy of 0.74 eV. Then the desorbed N2O molecule decomposes into a N2 molecule and an Oads atom on the surface or reacts with an upcoming CO molecule with small activation energies of 0.41 eV and 0.39 eV. The remaining surface Oads atoms are then reduced by CO to produce a CO2 with a small activation energy (0.44 eV). Attributed to the stable physical properties of penta-graphene, the cost-effectiveness of Fe, and relatively small energy barrier via the dimer mechanism, Fe–PG could be a promising catalyst for the reduction of NO by CO. Keywords NO catalytic reduction CO Penta-graphene DFT calculation Fe-doped 1 Introduction Using carbon monoxide (CO) as an alternative reducing agent of NH3 for selective catalytic NOx reduction (SCR) is straightforward and economical, since CO commonly exists in the exhaust gas as an unburnt pollutant from hydrocarbon or other fossil-fuel firing. Normally, the catalysts, which promote CO and NO reaction at the exhaust gas condition, are made of noble metals like Pt and Rh or transitional metals such as Ce, Mn, Cu, and Fe [1–6]. Noble metals are costly, while transitional metals often induce performance instability or low metal usage efficiency. Thus, alternative cost-effective catalysts with stable, high efficiency performance are demanding. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs), such as carbon-doped boron nitride nanosheets [7] and Si-doped boron nitride nanosheets [8] in which non-noble-metal single atoms are doped into the substrates at the atomic level, are found to be highly-active for NO removal in the presence of CO. These catalysts encouragingly possess the features of efficient metal usage, good stability, and low cost. The reported studies all used regular graphene with six-membered rings as the substrate. Theoretical calculations [9–12] showed graphene manifests great catalytic activity for CO oxidation and NO reduction. Besides the regular graphene, penta-graphene (PG), one of the allotropes of carbon, is also used to fabricate a catalyst substrate. PG consists of pentagon carbons with 3 and 4-coordinated sites and can be exfoliated from T12-carbon [12]. Molecular simulations proved that PG with mono-vacancy, di-vacancy and the Stone-Wales-like defects can also stay stable [13]. Compared to regular graphene with zero bandgap, PG has an intrinsic bandgap of ∼3.25 eV [14]. Due to its tunable properties via doping and hydrogenation, PG has been used for applications in catalysis, nanoelectronics and sensors [12,15–17]. Even Fe-doped PG (Fe–PG) was found to be highly active for catalytic CO oxidation [18]. Besides, PG is mechanically and dynamically stable even under a temperature up to 1000 K, and possesses excellent strength even comparable to regular graphene [12]. Adsorption behavior of small molecules indicates that metal-doped PG may enhance the interaction of molecules and substrate in the interface [19,20]. Given NO has a larger adsorption energy than CO on PG [21], surface reaction is expected to prevail as NO is present in the reactants. Together with its alterable properties and enhanced thermal and mechanical stabilities, PG could be a promising substrate. Consequently, in this paper, the potential of Fe-doped PG as a catalyst for NO reduction by CO is investigated using the DFT theoretical calculation. The adsorption configurations, electronic structures, and the reaction mechanism are revealed. The results could also provide insight for the design and development of single atom catalysts for the catalytic reduction of NO. 2 Model and method Calculations are carried out using the DMol3 or CASTEP module in Materials Studio (MS) software [22–24]. The exchange-correlation interactions are described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [25]. The double-numerical basis with polarization functions (DNP) is employed. Grimme’s scheme for DFT-D correction is adopted for the exchange-correlation energy function [26]. The real-space global orbital cutoff radius is set as 4.6 Å and spin polarization was allowed. The Brillouin-zone is integrated with 3 × 3 × 1 k-point sampling using the Monkhorst-Pack method and SCF tolerance is set to 1 × 10−6 Ha. The convergence criteria for energy, force and displacement are 1 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha/Å and 0.005 Å, respectively. To avoid the interaction between two PG layers, a vacuum layer of 30 Å is created. The charge transfer behavior and density difference calculations are performed using the CASTEP module. Other calculations including optimization, searching and confirmation of the transition state are performed using the DMol3 module. The transition state (TS) is located by using liner synchronous transit (LST)/quadratic synchronous transit (QST). The vibrational frequency calculation is performed on the obtained TS structure to ensure that it has only one imaginary frequency corresponding to the reaction coordinate. The adsorption energy (E ads) is calculated by E ads = E M-PG+gas – E M-PG – E gas [18], where E M-PG+gas, E M-PG, and E gas represent the total energies of the adsorbed configuration, the metal-doped PG, and the isolated gas molecule, respectively. A larger negative value of E ads indicates more energetically favorable adsorption. A primitive cell with six carbon atoms is optimized to build a 3 × 3 PG supercell, as shown in Fig. 1 . The six carbon atoms are divided into two kinds, two sp 3 hybridized carbon atoms and four sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms, denoted as C1 and C2 respectively. The configuration is optimized to verify the reasonability of the structure and the computations. The calculated lattice parameters of the primitive cell are a = b = 3.58 Å and the bond lengths of CC and CC are 1.34 Å and 1.54 Å, respectively, close to those reported by the previous studies [12,13,27]. The calculated band gap is 2.29 eV, falling in the range of 2.21–2.36 eV calculated by different DFT functionals [28]. Fe–PG is obtained by replacing one carbon atom in the 3 × 3 supercell. Previous studies [18,20] and our calculation demonstrate that the adsorption process on C2 cite-replaced PG is more rigorous. Therefore, hereafter, if no specification is given, Fe–PG is referred to that with the configuration of C2 cite-replacement, as shown in Fig. 1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Selection of desirable metal-doped PG catalysts The selection of desirable metal-doped PG catalysts are done first. Seven metal-doped PG catalysts including Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr and Al are considered. To examine the stability of these catalysts, their binding energies (E b) are calculated. E b is a useful parameter to check the binding intensity of the doped metal and the substrate, which is defined as E b = E M-PG – E PG – E M, where E M-PG, E PG and E M are the total energies of the metal-doped PG, the single-vacancy defective PG and the isolated metal, respectively. At the same, the average E b per atom (E b-average) is also shown in Table 1 . As we can see, the E b-average of these catalysts are between −7.02 to −6.96 eV, which is similar to that of the pristine PG (−7.07 eV), indicating that the doping of these metals doesn’t destruct the internal stability of the substrate. Besides, Fe- and Co-doped PG have the lowest E b, indicating that the interaction strength between Fe/Co and the single-vacancy PG is more stable compared with other metals. The adsorption ability is also important for the selection of catalysts. Fig. 2 shows the calculated E ads’s of Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr and Al-doped PGs. Except Al and Cu-doped ones, the other metal-doped PGs has a smaller E ads for NO adsorption than that for CO adsorption, indicating that on these catalysts the adsorption of NO is more vigorous than the adsorption of CO. The results are consistent with the results in Table 2 , in which the adsorption energies of NO and CO on various SACs reported in the literature are given. It can be seen that for the Ni-BNNT, both NO and CO have a large E ads (−3.5 eV and −2.78 eV). Therefore, they can be chemically adsorbed to result in a gas poison on the surface of Ni-BNNT. While for Si-BNNS and Ti-porphyrin, which have been verified to be good catalysts, they have appropriate E ads of NO and small E ads of CO. As for the present cases, the difference of E ads of NO and CO is large for Fe, Mn and Co-doped PG with moderate E ads’s of NO/CO. Fe, Mn and Co exhibit strong interaction with the gas molecules. Considering its merits of low cost, rich resources and stability, Fe–PG is chosen as a main potential catalyst to be studied. 3.2 Adsorption behavior of CO and NO over Fe–PG The adsorption of gas molecule is an initial and critical process of heterogeneous catalytic reaction. Table 3 shows the calculated E ads’s of C1 and C2 cite-replaced PGs, with comparison of those of pure PG. The results reconfirmed that Fe-doping enhances the adsorption process and the adsorption with C2 cite-replacement is obviously more rigorous. Adsorption configurations of single CO, NO, and double NO on Fe–PG are illustrated in Fig. 3 . For NO molecules, the N-down configuration (Fig. 3a) has a high E ads (E ads = −2.32 eV), 1.47 eV higher than the O-down configuration (Fig. 3c), while the configuration of parallel NO (Fig. 3b) has a moderate E ads (E ads = −1.74 eV). For the N-down configuration, NO molecule atom is almost vertical to Fe–PG surface with the distance of 1.71 Å between N and Fe atoms. At the same time, the N–O bond is elongated from 1.16 Å in the isolated form to 1.18 Å in the adsorbed form. As for CO molecules, the C-down configuration (Fig. 3d) has a relatively higher E ads of −1.63 eV, 1.3 eV higher than that of the O-down configuration (Fig. 3e). For the more stable C-down configuration of CO on Fe–PG, the C–O bond is prolonged from 1.14 Å in the isolated form to 1.16 Å in the adsorbed form, larger than the O-down bond. The adsorption configurations of two NO molecules are shown in Fig. 3f–h. Fig. 3f illustrates a (NO)2 dimer structure in which two NO molecules form a ring with a N–N covalent bond and NO is adsorbed on an Fe atom of Fe–PG via two O atoms. The distances of two formed Fe–O bonds are almost the same and the N–N bond distance is 1.26 Å. The structure has a high E ads of −3.05 eV, which means that (NO)2 is strongly chemisorbed over Fe–PG. The structure is similar to that of metal-based or metal-free catalysts during the reduction of NO [31,32]. Fig. 3g demonstrates an almost parallel adsorption configuration of two NO molecules with an relatively small E ads of −2.67 eV, only slightly lower than that of a single NO (E ads = −2.32 eV). This means that the adsorption of the second NO is rather weak. The third configuration as shown in Fig. 3h displays that two NO molecules are both adsorbed on Fe–PG via their N atom with a large E ads of −3.74 eV. The two N–Fe bond distances are almost equal. The Fe atom of Fe–PG is extruded from the PG sheet severely compared with other structures. Fig. 4 further shows the electron density differences (EDD) and corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) of the most favorable configurations of NO and CO adsorbed on Fe–PG. The strong hybridization between NO-2p and Fe-3d with new emerging peaks around the Fermi energy indicates the formation of chemical bonds, demonstrating that the adsorbed NO is activated by Fe–PG. The charge transfer can be obtained by Mulliken population analysis. The results show that 0.23 |e| is transferred from Fe–PG to the 2π* orbitals of the NO molecule and Fe loses 0.11 |e|. The obtained EDD plot (Fig. 4a) shows a remarkable electron accumulation between the N atom of NO and Fe atom of Fe–PG, which also verifies the forming of chemical bonds between NO and Fe. With regard to CO, the Mulliken analysis indicates that Fe loses 0.08 |e| and CO gains 0.17 |e|. Similar to NO, most electrons accumulate in the vicinity of the Fe–CO interface. The PDOS of CO also shows moderate hybridization between Fe-3d and CO-2p, but less remarkably than that of NO. Comparing the adsorption energy, charge transfer and the overlap of PDOS, one can see that the interaction between NO and Fe–PG is stronger than that of CO and Fe–PG, indicating that the adsorption of NO occurs first. 3.3 Discussion on the direct dissociation of NO According to the previous studies, the mechanisms of NO reduction by CO mainly include two pathways. One is the direct dissociation of NO and the other is the dissociation of (NO)2 dimer, which is also called dimer mechanism [8]. The mechanism of NO dissociation starts from the most stable NO pre-adsorption since E ads of NO is −2.32 eV, which is larger than that of CO. The potential energy profile is illustrated in Fig. 5 . As the reaction R1 shows, the absorbed NO molecule dissociated into Nads and Oads atoms on the Fe–PG surface through a transition state TS1 with a large energy barrier of 5.38 eV. The structure FS1 is relatively stable. The process of IS1 to FS1 is exothermic by 0.12 eV. According to previous studies [7,8,33–35], the activation energies of the dissociation reaction of NO on the catalyst surface range between 0.63–5.38 eV. Thus, NO reduction on Fe–PG through the direct dissociation of NO is not favored both kinetically and thermodynamically. (R1) N O a d s → N a d s + O a d s 3.4 Discussion on the dimer mechanism for NO reduction Fig. 6 depicts the possible reaction pathways of NO reduction by CO through the dimer mechanism. The reaction begins with the adsorption of (NO)2 dimer structure (IS2) as shown in Fig. 3f. Then the N2O molecule and Oads species are generated through the transition state TS2 by breaking one of the N–O bonds (R2). As evident, one of the Fe–O bonds in TS2 is elongated from 1.85 Å to 2.16 Å, and the other is shortened from 1.86 Å to 1.67 Å, compared with the original reactant IS2. This process only needs to overcome a relatively small activation energy of 0.74 eV. Meanwhile, the reaction R2 is exothermic by 0.4 eV, indicating a good stability of the products. The generated N2O from reaction R2 then decomposes into a N2 molecule and an Oads atom through reaction R3 by overcoming a small energy barrier of 0.41 eV. It is obvious that the N–O bond in the transition state TS3 gets longer than that of IS3 and the Fe–O bond is shortened, indicating the upcoming break-down of the N–O bond, and thus the generation of N2 and Oads. The reaction energy of reaction R3 is calculated to be −1.69 eV, indicating the stability of the products. The N2 can easily desorb from the surface. In addition, as reaction R4 showed, the N-down adsorbed N2O molecule (IS4) could react with an upcoming CO molecule by breaking the N–O bond, generating CO2 and N2(ads) molecules. The E ads of N2 is −0.87 eV, and this energy can be provided by the large exothermic reaction of reaction R4 (−3.4 eV). The remaining Oads atom from the preceding reaction R2 and R3 could be removed by CO by overcoming a small energy barrier of 0.44 eV. A CO molecule approaches the surface Oads within the distance between C atom and Oads of 1.76 Å as shown in the transition state TS5. The bond distance between O atom of the formed CO2 (FS5) and the surface Fe atom is 2.2 Å and the calculated E ads of CO2 molecule on the surface is −0.48 eV. Thus, the CO2 molecule is weakly adsorbed on the surface, and it can easily escape. The reaction of Oads removal by CO (R5) is strongly exothermic by 1.78 eV, indicating that the reaction can be easily completed at room temperature.

The compared catalysts include Ti-porphyrin, Rh7 + cluster, Au–CeO2 (1 1 0), Si-BNNs, Pd/Ni-BNNs, and Au (3 2 1). They are reported to have good performance in NOx reduction in the presence of CO. It can be seen that the dissociation reaction of NO molecules on the surface of Fe–PG has a much higher activation energy than other reactions, indicating that it is barely possible to happen. For the main reactions described by the dimer mechanism, their energy barriers on Fe–PG are close to or even smaller than those on the noble metal catalysts. For example, the energy barrier of reaction R5, a key step to remove the Oads atom from the surface of catalysts, is 0.44 eV on Fe–PG, much lower than that on Rh7 + of 0.77 eV. Besides, the energy barrier for the rate-determining step (R2) of the dimer mechanism on Fe–PG, namely the dissociation of the (NO)2 dimer into N2O and Oads, is only 0.74 eV. This value is also much lower than that of the rate-determining step of other catalysts such as Au–CeO2 (1 1 0). The results illustrate that Fe–PG could have better catalytic performance than the compared catalysts and could be a promising catalyst for the reduction of NO by CO. 4 Conclusions The potential of Fe-doped penta-graphene (Fe–PG) as a catalyst for reduction of NO by CO is investigated by a Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. The adsorption behavior of small molecules like NO and CO indicates that Fe–PG enhances the interaction of molecules and substrate in the interface compared with pure PG. The calculated adsorption energy, charge transfer, and PDOS show that the interaction between NO and the surface is stronger than that of CO. The direct dissociation of NO is barely possible to proceed due to a high energy barrier of 5.38 eV. The structure of adsorbed (NO)2 dimers is discovered on the surface, which is the starting step of dimer mechanism. The reaction pathways analysis explores that the (NO)2 dimer could be dissociated into a N2O molecule and an Oads atom over a relatively small activation energy of 0.74 eV. The desorbed N2O molecule decomposes into a N2 molecule and an Oads atom on the surface or react with an upcoming CO molecule with small activation energies of 0.41 eV and 0.39 eV. The remaining Oads atoms are then reduced by a CO molecule to produce a CO2 molecule with a small activation energy (0.44 eV). These reactions via the dimer mechanism are both kinetically and thermodynamically favored. Attributed to the stable physical properties of penta-graphene, the cost-effective of Fe, and relatively small energy barrier via dimer mechanism, Fe–PG could be a promising catalyst for the reduction of NO by CO.

        "dc:description": "The potential of Fe-doped penta-graphene (Fe–PG) as a catalyst for reduction of NO by CO is investigated by a Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. The results of adsorption energy, charge transfer and partial density of states (PDOS) indicate that the adsorption of NO on the surface is stronger than that of CO. The direct dissociation of NO is barely possible to occur because the dissociation of NO has a very high activation energy of 5.38 eV. The structure of adsorbed (NO)2 dimers is discovered on the surface, which initiates the reaction described by the dimer mechanism. (NO)2 dimers dissociate into a N2O molecule and an Oads atom over a relatively small activation energy of 0.74 eV. Then the desorbed N2O molecule decomposes into a N2 molecule and an Oads atom on the surface or reacts with an upcoming CO molecule with small activation energies of 0.41 eV and 0.39 eV. The remaining surface Oads atoms are then reduced by CO to produce a CO2 with a small activation energy (0.44 eV). Attributed to the stable physical properties of penta-graphene, the cost-effectiveness of Fe, and relatively small energy barrier via the dimer mechanism, Fe–PG could be a promising catalyst for the reduction of NO by CO.",
