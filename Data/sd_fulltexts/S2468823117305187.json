Graphical abstract CeO2 as catalysts for imine synthesis was synthesized from three different inorganic precursors (Ce(OH)4, Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O) in ethylene glycol (EG) as solvothermal solvent. The influences of some parameters were investigated, such as the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), H2O as co-solvent, and CH3COOH or NaOH as mineralizer (exclusive for Ce(NO3)3 as the precursor). The different precursors influenced the coordination of EG with cerium, crystalline, surface structure and also the catalytic ability for imine synthesis. The highest imine conversion rate was obtained when CeO2 was synthesized from Ce(NO3)3 +PVP+CH3COOH +EG. The mechanism was investigated by carefully checking the structures of the synthesized CeO2, such as XRD, morphology, surface area, XPS and so on, and figured out that the high catalytic activity of the best CeO2 sample was much more related with the high proportion of surface oxygen vacancies than the surface area and the Ce3+ ratio. Keywords Ceria catalyst Precursor influences Ethylene glycol Imine synthesis Surface oxygen vacancy 1 Introduction CeO2 is a well-known catalytic material due to its high oxygen storage and release capacity related to the Ce3+-Ce4+ redox cycle·CeO2 based materials have been widely used as CO oxidation catalyst (e.g [1,2]), NOx reduction catalyst ([3–5]), photocatalyst ([6,7]) and also very recently as catalyst for imine synthesis ([8–11]). Two properties are very important for CeO2 as a catalyst: (a) a high Ce3+ proportion, and (b) a high surface area, providing more reaction sites. Thus, much effort has been spent on these two aspects, and varying the ceria precursor is one possibility ([2,12]). Qi et al. proved that the use of Ce(NO3)3 or (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 as precursor can influence the content of Ce3+ in the synthesized CeO2 and the catalytic ability for CO oxidation [13], and Ce(NO3)3 yielded CeO2 with a higher Ce3+ proportion. We previously used cerium tert-butoxide (Ce(O t Bu)4) as precursor and synthesized CeO2 with very high surface area (up to 277m2/g) [14]. and with graphene-like residues [15]. During previous syntheses, solvothermal processing proved to be a convenient and efficient way to get CeO2 with high surface area. Ethylene glycol (EG) has been used as solvent on many occasions (e.g [16–18]) because of its high boiling point. Previous reports also indicated that Ce(OH)4 can form Ce(EG)2 under certain condition [19,20], and cerium glycolate was already used as precursor to synthesize CeO2 [21–23]. Recently, EG was used as chelating agent for Ce(NO3)3 and influenced the synthesized CeO2-(ZrO2)-Al2O3 composite materials [17]. It was hardly investigated how different cerium salts influence the properties of CeO2 prepared under solvothermal condition in EG, and how the structural changes would influence the catalytic activity in imine synthesis (firstly reported in 2015 by M. Tamura et al. [8]). Imine is an important intermediate in the synthesis of various biological, agricultural, and pharmaceutical compounds. The use of CeO2 as catalyst is more easily to separate than the conventional catalyst such as KOH, NaOH, and DABCO [8], and it can be used at low temperature. There are also some literatures using oxides (eg. MnOx) based catalysts [24–27]. for imine synthesis, which were also easy to separate. But they functioned mostly at above 100°C, and at low temperature the conversion of imine was very low [8]. This research focuses on the preparation and characterization of CeO2 from different cerium precursors in EG system, and the imine synthesis was used to check the catalytic ability of the synthesized CeO2. Three different inorganic cerium compounds (Ce(OH)4, Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O) were used as starting materials in solvothermal syntheses with EG as solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as surfactant to stabilize small CeO2 particles and thus provide high surface areas. For Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O, the effects of H2O and different mineralizer were also investigated. The properties of the synthesized CeO2 were checked by IR, TGA, XRD, XPS and BET. The materials were used as catalyst for imine synthesis at low temperatures (room temperature, 25°C), and the imine formation rate was used to characterize the catalytic ability of CeO2. Finally, the parameters influencing the CeO2 catalytic activity were analyzed and the mechanism of CeO2 during imine formation was proposed. 2 Experimental section 2.1 CeO2 synthesis All chemicals were AR grade from adamas reagent Co., and used as received. Ce(OH)4, Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O were used as precursors. Ethylene glycol was used as solvent, while PVP (k 10–15) was used as surfactant. In a typical synthesis, the ceria precursor (5mmol) was dissolved in 50mL of ethylene glycol (EG). Then 1.5g of PVP was added and the mixture stirred for 30min. To the samples prepared from Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O as the precursor, a mineralizer was added. The solution was then transferred into an autoclave with Teflon inline (100mL). The autoclave was sealed and kept at 190°C for 6h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the suspension was centrifuged at 9500rpm and the solid residue washed three times with ethanol. The obtained powders were dried in vacuum at 60°C for at least 12h. Part of the samples were calcined at 500°C for 1h (heating rate: 2°C/min). The starting mixtures of the different samples are listed in Table 1 . 2.2 CeO2 characterization The surface groups of CeO2 were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum one spectrometer. The XRD patterns were recorded with a Shimadzu (Japan) D/Max-2500 diffractometer using monochromatized, nickel-filtered CuKα radiation. The morphology of the CeO2 samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-8000, Japan) in a secondary electron scattering mode at 5kV. Thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was performed on a NETZSCH STA2500 from room temperature to 800°C in air with 10°C/min ramping rate. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to determine the particle size, by using PSS Nicomp 380 at 25C with the measurement angle of 173 (back scatter). Samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol for 15min and then left standing 2min for balancing. Mean diameters were obtained from three measurements. N2 adsorption/desorption was measured at 77K by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. All samples were degassed at 120°C for at least 5h before testing. The specific surface area was obtained by the BET method, and the pore size distribution was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 xi (England) using AlKα radiation (1486.6eV). Binding energies were calculated with respect to C(1s) at 284.8eV. Binding energies were measured with a precision of ±0.05eV. Before XPS test, all samples were calcined at 500°C for 1h in the air to clean the surface. Then the samples were kept in glove box (H2O<1ppm) until XPS test. The Ce:O ratio was calibrated by using a standard CeO2 from Sigma-Aldrich. XPS data were analyzed using XPSPEAK 4.1 software, and all the fitted peaks were of a Gaussian-Lorentzian shape. The relative standard deviation Σχ2 were below 10. 2.3 Catalytic experiments The catalytic test was modified based on the design of Tamura [8]. Benzyl alcohol (10mmol) and aniline (20mmol) were put in a reaction tube under air without solvent. Then 50mg CeO2 was added and stirred vigorously at 500rpm at room temperature (ca. 25°C). For conversion detection, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the liquids were transferred to new vials. The products were diluted in ethanol and analyzed by using a Shimadzu GC2014 plus equipped with an Rxi-5ms capillary column and a flame ionization detector. In order to compare with the other researches, the reaction rates were used to characterize the catalytic ability, by calculating the imine formation amount per hour per catalyst amount (mmolh−1 g−1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization of CeO2 catalysts The influence of different precursors can be seen firstly from the color of the solvothermally treated solution (Fig. 1 right). Samples 1 and 2 with light brown color were prepared from Ce(OH)4, without and with PVP, respectively. Yellowish-white sample 3 was synthesized from Ce(COOCH3)3. Ce(NO3)3 was used as precursor for samples 4–6, but with different solvent and mineralizer, exhibiting very different colors: black (CH3COOH), brown (H2O+CH3COOH) and white (H2O+NaOH). After the samples had been centrifuged and dried overnight, IR spectra were taken to characterize their surface (Fig. 1 left). All samples had bands at 2849 and 2925cm−1, corresponding to CH2 and CH3 vibrations, caused by residual PVP and EG. Sample 6 showed the weakest signals at these two positions. Furthermore, the samples prepared without external H2O (samples 1–4) exhibited a sharp peak at 1085cm−1, which corresponds to CO vibrations. This information proved that EG is coordinated to Ce through CeOC bonds. H2O accelerates the breaking of these bonds through hydrolysis reactions. Carbon-containing groups on the surface of CeO2 result in vibrations at 1607 and 1654cm−1. This is similar as in a previous study using ethanol as solvent [14]. Coordination of EG can be further proven by TG-DTA analysis (Fig. 2 ). Except sample 6, all samples gave large weight loss and heat release at ca. 250°C. The weight loss was almost the same when external H2O was not involved during the synthesis and was in the range of 30–40% for samples 1–4. When external H2O was added to the solvothermal solvent, the intensity of heat release peak decreased dramatically, from ca. 30W/g to only 2–4W/g, and the weight loss of sample 5 and 6 was also reduced to only 11% and 9%, respectively. These results prove the coordination of EG to Ce, and that H2O can break the bonds between Ce and EG, resulting in less carbon-containing residues. The as-prepared and calcined samples were also characterized by XRD (Fig. 3 ). The diffraction peak intensities were different for as-prepared samples from different precursors (Fig. 3 left). Furthermore, samples from Ce(OH)4 consisted only of CeO2 as the crystalline phase (PDF No: 34-0394), while the use of Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O yielded additionally Ce2O3 as crystalline phase. For Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O as the precursor, the intensity of the diffraction peaks increased slightly by the addition of H2O, and enhanced greatly when NaOH was used as mineralizer instead of CH3COOH. After calcination at 500°C for 1h (Fig. 3 right), all samples were pure CeO2, only the crystalline particle sizes varied in the range of 7.2–9.7nm. The images of the synthesized CeO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4 . When there was no external H2O in the solvothermal solvent, only sample 3 with Ce(COOCH3)3 as the precursor resulted in large particles, which were about 150–300nm in diameter. Samples 1&2 had small particles of 10–20nm in diameter, and 30–40nm for sample 4. These sizes are larger than the crystalline particle sizes in Fig. 3, but much smaller than the DLS particle size in Table 1. This suggested that the particles in SEM images are agglomerations of small crystalline particle (7.2–9.7nm) and can further aggregate in ethanol. The agglomeration of particles may reduce the surface area and the total surface oxygen vacancies. When H2O was added to the Ce(NO3)3 system using PVP as surfactant (sample 5) large particles of 400nm in diameter were obtained, in agreement with the DLS measurements. The formation of large spheres was because of PVP surfactant, reaching a critical micelle concentration when both H2O and CH3COOH existed. Taking the crystalline particle sizes in Fig. 3 into account, the material must also be agglomerated. Use of NaOH as mineralizer, and PVP as surfactant (sample 6) resulted in small particles of 10–20nm in diameter. All samples calcined at 500°C for 1h were characterized by XP spectra (Fig. 5 ) and N2 sorption, the results were summarized in Table 2 . For XPS test, all the samples were pre-treated in the air at 500°C for 1h to clean the surface including H2O. Then they were kept in glove boxes before XPS test. The H2O of the glove box is <1ppm. As the catalytic ability of CeO2 is closely related to the Ce3+ proportion, the Ce 3d region of XP spectra is shown in Fig. 5 left. The Ce 3d region contains five doublets (v denotes Ce 3d5/2, u denotes Ce 3d3/2). v0, v′, u0, u′ belong to Ce3+ species, whereas v, v″, v‴, u, u‴ and u‴ belong to Ce4+ species [28]. To calculate the Ce3+/(Ce3+ +Ce4+) ratio (abbreviated “Ce3+ ratio”), the peak area of the u0 (v0) and u′ (v′) relative to the area of the entire Ce 3d region was determined [13]. All the synthesized CeO2 samples possessed much higher Ce3+ ratios than commercial CeO2 (5%). Except sample 1 with a relatively low Ce3+ ratio (ca. 11.5%), all the other samples had a Ce3+ ratio of about 20%, suggesting that the use of EG and PVP was beneficial for increasing the Ce3+ ratio. The ceria precursor had almost no influence on the Ce3+ ratio. The amount of oxygen vacancies on CeO2 surface can be deducted by the O1 s results. It has been reported that H2O prefers to stay on the lattice oxygen on the surface, and the surface oxygen vacancies on CeO2 (111) surface suppressed the formation and adsorption of H2O by surface hydroxyl as proposed both experimentally and theoretically [29–34]. As all the samples in this experiment were calcined in the air at 500°C for 1h and kept in glove boxes before XPS test. The detected H2O signal was from the transformation of surface hydroxyl or chemisorbed H2O. Thus the amount of H2O on the surface can be used to express the number of surface oxygen vacancies. The less H2O exists, the higher amount is the surface oxygen vacancy. When focusing on the O 1 s XP spectra (Fig. 5 right), the region can be fitted to three peaks: (1) 533.1eV, corresponding to H2O physically/chemically adsorbed on the CeO2 surface; (2) 531.4eV, assigned to OH* chemically absorbed on the CeO2 surface; (3) 529.3eV, belonging to CeO2. By calculating the area of each peak, the O% of H2O for the synthesized samples are: sample 1 (10.8%)>sample 6 (4.2%)>sample 3 (1.2%)>sample 2 (1.0%)>sample 5 (0.7%)>sample 4 (0.3%), indicating that sample 4 had the most oxygen vacancies on the surface. The surface oxygen vacancies can also be proven by the O/Ce ratio (Table 2). Basically, the higher the Ce3+ ratio is, the lower is the O/Ce ratio. In Table 2 the reverse trends is found. For example, when sample 4 is compared with sample 3, the Ce3+ ratio of sample 4 is 20.1%, lower than 21.5% of sample 3. In principle, the O/Ce ratio of sample 4 should be somewhat higher than that of sample 3. But the detected O/Ce ratio was 1.93 for sample 4 and 2.01 for sample 3. This is probably due to the penetration depth (about 10nm) of XPS, which is a surface analysis method. Considering that the crystallite sizes of all samples were in the range of 7.2–9.7nm (Fig. 3), the detection can penetrate one whole crystalline particle and reach the surface of another crystalline particle. Thus the kind of surface atom can theoretically influence the O/Ce ratio, and it can be used as a reference to evaluate the relative amount of surface oxygen vacancies. By subtracting the influence of Ce3+ on the O/Ce ratio (O/Ce-1.5Ce3+%, named as terminal O/Ce), the lower terminal O/Ce ratio indicates less oxygen as surface-terminating atom. The sequence of terminal O/Ce ratio is sample 1 (2.79)>sample 6 (1.75)>sample 3 (1.69)>sample 2 (1.68)>sample 5 (1.66)>sample 4 (1.63), in the same sequence of O% (H2O) in Fig. 5 right. This proved that sample 4 had the lowest O proportion as terminal atoms and most oxygen vacancies on the surface. When Ce(NO3)3 was used as precursor, adding of H2O or NaOH as mineralizer increased the proportion of terminal O atoms, suggesting that the amount of surface oxygen vacancies decreased. The Na content was also checked by XPS, and there was almost no Na residue. The reason for the very high O/Ce ratio of sample 1 is not clear; perhaps the absence of PVP had some influence. All N2 adsorption – desorption isotherms (Fig. S1) belong to IUPAC type IV classification [35], indicating that the synthesized CeO2 samples were mesoporous. In the absence of H2O, the highest surface area of 175.8m2/g belonged to CeO2 from Ce(NO3)3, and the lowest of 128m2/g to that from Ce(OH)4. The use of PVP did not increase the surface area for Ce(OH)4 as precursor, but can increase the Ce3+ ratio. The N2 adsorption – desorption results indicated that the ceria precursor can influence the surface area. For Ce(NO3)3, addition of H2O decreased the surface area (from 175.8m2/g to 87.2m2/g) of CeO2, which may not only be related to the hydrolysis of CeOC bonds (as indicated in TGA results), but also influenced by the change of CeO2 morphology (with H2O, the sample consisted of large spheres of 400nm in diameter, rather than 30–40nm small particles in the pure EG system). The change of mineralizer can also influence the surface area, but has almost no influence on the Ce3+ ratio. 3.2 Catalytic test of CeO2 All samples were used as catalysts for imine synthesis, as summarized in Fig. 6 . An amount of 10mmol of benzyl alcohol and 20mmol of aniline were put in a test tube, using 50mg CeO2 as the catalyst (Fig. 6(a)). The experiments were carried out at room temperature (ca. 25°C) in natural light for at least 3h. The reaction rate is used to express the catalytic ability of CeO2, by calculating the imine formation per catalyst amount per hour using the conversion below 20%. The reaction rate sequence was sample 4 (1.61mmolh−1 g−1)> sample 5 (1.51mmolh−1 g−1)>sample 3 (0.35 mmolh−1 g−1)>sample 2 (0.23mmolh−1 g−1)>sample 6 (0.22 mmolh−1 g−1)>sample 1 (0.05mmolh−1 g−1). The highest reaction rate 1.61mmolh−1 g−1 belongs to sample 4, much higher than the reported 0.46mmolh−1 g−1 [8]. The used CeO2 were collected and heated at 500°C for 1h, and re-used for imine synthesis again. The reaction rates were almost the same as those of fresh CeO2. The adsorption influence of catalyst was also studied by using the best sample 4 (Fig. 6(b)). When the catalyst amount changed from 25mg to 50mg and to 100mg, the reaction rate increased from 0.58mmolh−1 g−1 to 1.6mmolh−1 g−1 and then to 1.88mmolh−1 g−1. This may be because the prepared CeO2 was of mesoporous structure, and can adsorb the reactant or intermediate, blocking the active sites of CeO2 catalyst. The desorbing of adsorbate probably needed a while to reach a balance. Thus more CeO2 loading can provide more active sites and the adsoring-desorbing can reach a faster balance. The influences of temperature were also studied by using the best sample (No. 4). Three different temperatures (25°C, 50°C, and 70°C) were used and calculated the reaction rates (Fig. 6(c)). When the temperature rise from 25°C to 50°C, the reaction rate increased from 1.6mmolh−1 g−1–4.9mmolh−1 g−1, increasing to more than 3 times. Further increase the temperature to 70°C, the reaction rate only improved slightly to 5.61mmolh−1 g−1. 3.3 Catalytic mechanism of CeO2 as imine catalyst Compared with the reaction without catalyst (sample 0, 0.01mmolh−1 g−1), the use of CeO2 prepared from Ce(NO3)3 can improve the conversion greatly (sample 4, 1.6mmolh−1 g−1). It is clear for sample 4 because of the high surface area and relatively high Ce3+ ratio. But for sample 5, the results are difficult to explain just from conventional surface area and Ce3+ ratio parameters. It had a lower surface area (87.2m2/g) and a smaller Ce3+ ratio (19.7%) than those of sample 3 (132.9m2/g, 21.5%), but a rather higher reaction rate of 1.51mmolh−1 g−1 compared with 0.35mmolh−1 g−1 of sample 3. This is perhaps related to the amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface. In Table 2 and Fig. 5, the amount of surface oxygen vacancies was evaluated from the O% of H2O by XPS fitting and from the terminal O/Ce ratio after removing the influence of the Ce3+ stoichiometry. The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies was the almost same sequence (except sample 2 and 3) as the imine formation rate: sample 4>sample 5>sample 2>sample 3>sample 6>sample 1 (the reaction rate of sample 3 was 0.35mmolh−1 g−1, a little bit higher than 0.23mmolh−1 g−1 of sample 2, which may be because sample 3 was with a higher surface area.). Thus, the conversion is probably greatly related with the amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface. It’s well known that CeO2 is very easy to lose O to form oxygen vacancies, and oxygen vacancies of CeO2 can react with O2 to form active oxygen atom O*. This may happen similar during imine synthesis. It has been proved that O2 is necessary during imine synthesis by using CeO2 as catalyst [8]. The oxygen vacancies of CeO2 can generate active oxygen atom O* (Eq. (1)), and O* can react with benzyl alcohol to form benzaldehyde and OH* radical (Eq. (2)). The OH* radical will attack aniline to form H2O and an intermediate (Eq. (3)), which will react fast with benzaldehyde to form imine (Eq. (4)). As the bulk oxygen vacancies are not easily to get access to O2 and the reactant or intermediate, and at low temperature the migration of bulk oxygen vacancies is not fast, the amount of surface oxygen vacancies is more important. This has also been proved in toluene oxidation by using CeO2 as catalyst [36]. Thus, the more oxygen vacancies (less O atoms) on the surface are, the higher is the CeO2 catalytic ability for imine synthesis, as sketched in Fig. 7 . (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 4 Conclusions CeO2 was synthesized from three different inorganic precursors (Ce(OH)4, Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O) and used as catalyst for imine synthesis. The results indicated that Ce(NO3)3 was the best precursor to obtain the most effective CeO2 catalyst. The use of pure EG as solvent and CH3COOH as mineralizer were beneficial to enhance the catalytic ability, comparing with EG+H2O as solvent and NaOH as mineralizer. The relative amount of surface oxygen vacancies was evaluated from the O% of H2O in O 1 s peak fitting and the O/Ce ratio subtracting 1.5 Ce3+%. It was found that the sample from Ce(NO3)3 +EG+PVP+CH3COOH had relatively more surface oxygen vacancies than the other samples. This is probably the reason of high catalytic ability besides high surface area and high Ce3+ ratio. Acknowledgments Thanks to Dr. H. Li for the kind assistance of XPS analysis.

        "dc:description": "CeO2 as catalysts for imine synthesis was synthesized from three different inorganic precursors (Ce(OH)4, Ce(COOCH3)3∙5H2O and Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O) in ethylene glycol (EG) as solvothermal solvent. The influences of some parameters were investigated, such as the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), H2O as co-solvent, and CH3COOH or NaOH as mineralizer (exclusive for Ce(NO3)3 as the precursor). The different precursors influenced the coordination of EG with cerium, crystalline, surface structure and also the catalytic ability for imine synthesis. The highest imine conversion rate was obtained when CeO2 was synthesized from Ce(NO3)3 +PVP+CH3COOH +EG. The mechanism was investigated by carefully checking the structures of the synthesized CeO2, such as XRD, morphology, surface area, XPS and so on, and figured out that the high catalytic activity of the best CeO2 sample was much more related with the high proportion of surface oxygen vacancies than the surface area and the Ce3+ ratio.",
