Introduction Ruthenium complexes have been shown to act as efficient homogeneous catalysts for the regioselective Markovnikov-type addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes to produce enol esters in high yields [Ij. The latter constitute excellent acylation reagents of amines and alco- hols [2,3] under very mild conditions, with re- lease of a volatile ketone as the only by-product (Eq. 1). The overall process could be used for the large scale synthesis of activated enol di- esters, potential polymer precursors on reaction with diamines or diols, if the recovery of the ruthenium catalyst could be achieved, even if efficient ruthenium catalysts are not that very expensive. v o OH [Ru]cat R\\/0 HYR' Y\"Y (a) (b) \"Y 0 v 0 Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/S15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Lavasin' fi ill. /Joiiriuil of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 10811996) 29-34 To be of practical use a recyclable polymer- linked catalyst has to fill several criteria: (i) the clean synthesis of the supported catalyst to avoid the presence of polymeric impurities, (ii) the weak decrease of catalytic activity induced by the polymeric matrix, (iii) an efficient technique of catalyst recovery, and (iv) the retention of activity after several recycles. The anchoring of an homogeneous catalyst to a polymeric support is a general approach to obtain supported catalyst [4,5]. However, as the fixation of a catalytic species to a polymer is never complete, the presence of some remaining free macromolecules leads to a decrease of the catalyst activity. The polymerization of a monomeric catalyst [6] is an alternative to gen- erate a supported catalyst with some key advan- tages such as the control of the concentration in metal fragment or the nature of the polymer matrix (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar...) by using adapted organic comonomers. The homogeneous catalyst [Ru( fi- O^CHXCO^PPh:^ A has appeared to be one of the most efficient catalyst for the generation of enol esters (Eq. 1 (a)) and for the catalytic synthesis of dioxolanones by addition of man- delic acid to terminal alkynes [7]. As catalyst A was lost during the purification steps we at- tempted to anchor this catalyst on a polymeric phosphine leading to a soluble catalyst at reac- tion temperature, thus homogeneous, but insolu- ble at room temperature to favor the recovery. We report here (i) the synthesis of a new binuclear ruthenium catalyst [Ru( fi- O^CH)(CO)^[PPh^PE)]]^ 3 containing a diphenylphosphinated polyethylene ligand PPh^PE^PPh^CH^CH^CH^CH-,, (ii) the catalytic properties of 3, soluble in toluene at 100, towards the synthesis of a dioxolanone and enol diesters at 100, and (iii) the easy recycling of catalyst 3 and retention of its effi- ciency after six recycles. 2. Results and discussion The polymeric phosphines 1 have been pre- pared by anionic polymerization of ethyiene followed by quenching with chlorodiphenylphosphine [8j.

A white precipitate appeared and, after 30 h, the resulting lithiated polyethylene oligomers were quenched with CIPPh^ in excess (32 mmol), After purification a white powder (7 g) of la was obtained (Scheme 1). The 31? NMR spectrum of la, in toluene-dg at 100, showed only a singlet at 5= -13.9 ppm corresponding to a diphenyl phosphinated polyethylene (no signal at 8 ~ 36 ppm corre- sponding to phosphine oxide was observed [8]). The loading of Ph^P end groups was estimated by 'H NMR spectroscopy. A sample of phos- phine la in the presence of a weighed amount of ferrocene, in toluene-dg at 100, allowed the determination, via integration, of the Ph^P/FetCsHg)^ ratio, and consequently that 1 g of phosphine la contains approximately 0.4 mmol of Ph^P groups. This measurement is consistent with an average molecular mass M^ = 2300, corresponding to the formula CH^CH^CH^CH^PPha, and elemental anal- ysis. As in living ethylene polymerization the length of the chain increases with the reaction time under constant pressure of ethylene, a polyethylene phosphine Ib containing a shorter polyethylene chain was prepared analogously to la, but the quenching with CIPPh^ was per- formed after 17 h at room temperature. Ib was obtained (7.6 g) and identified as CH^CH^CH^CH^oPPhz (M^-1600, 0.63 mmol of Ph^P groups per gram of polymer). The preparation of a complex similar to [Ru( ^-O^CHXCO^PPhJz but with a long hy- drocarbon chain containing phosphine Ib was attempted via a modified procedure of that lead- ing to [Ru(Ja-02CH)(CO)2PPh,]2 [9]. [Ru( fi- O^CHXCO^],, 2 [9] (1.5 mmol of Ru atoms), polymeric phosphine Ib (1.5 mmol of PPh^ groups) in methylcyclohexane were stirred at 100 in a homogeneous solution for 3 h. The nitration at room temperature and washing of the solid with diethyl ether led to the isolation of a yellow powder identified as complex 3 (95% yield) (Scheme 1). The infrared spectrum of 3 showed absorptions at v (cm ~') = 2026 (m), 1983 (w), 1954 (m) for carbonyl ligands and at 1595 cm\"' for the ^(.-formate bridging ligand [9]. The -^'P NMR spectrum of 3 (toiuene-dg, 100) showed only one singlet at S = 1! .96 ppm consistent with a coordinated phosphine ligand. No signal for the uncoordi- nated phosphine Ib (5= 3.9 ppm) was ob- served. The NMR and the elemental analysis of 3 was in agreement with the coordination of one phosphine to each ruthenium atom [Ru( fi- O.CHXCOV.PPh^CH^CH^soCH^CH,)^. 3. Catalytic properties of polymeric catalyst 3 The catalytic efficiency of 3 was compared to that of [Ru( /A-O^CHXCO^PPh:,^ A in the synthesis of dioxolanone 7 from the cc-hydroxy carboxylic acid 4 and hex-1-yne 5 [7] (Eq. 2). This reaction was difficult to perform and among a variety of ruthenium catalysts, only the latter complex A and an alkenyl-ruthenium precursor [10] were shown to be efficient.

Lwastrv ct dl. /Journal of Molecular Cauily.w A: Chemical 108 <i9y6) 29- ^4 The solution became homogeneous and was stirred for 20 h. After cooling at 25, the catalyst 3 was separated by filtration from the solution. The purification of the crude product by vacuum transfer gave 83% of pure diox- olanone 7 and both the enol ester intermediate 6 and the starting carboxylic acid were absent. Complex 3 thus provides a similar activity as A (84% of 7 for 20 h at 100 [7]) but with a lower diastereoselectivity (cis/irons ^ 5/1 (3) and 9/1 (A)). This lower diastereoselectivity in the metal-assisted intramolecular cyclization (6 -> 7) with supported catalyst 3 could be due to a different steric hindrance induced by the pres- ence of the polyethylene chain. 4. One-step catalytic synthesis of activated e.iol diesters The ruthenium containing oligomer 3 was used as a catalyst to activate terminal alkynes towards the addition of carboxylic diacids 8-10 and produce new enol diesters 11-15 according to Eq. 3. + 2 R- S-W : -(CH;)4- 8,11,12 ; -(CH:,)2- 9,13,14; | 11 -15 10,15 In a typical procedure a carboxylic diacid (10 mmol) and 2 equivalents of terminal alkyne were mixed with catalyst 3 (0.36 g, 0.1 mmol) (3) in 20 ml of toluene. The heterogeneous mixture at room temperature became totally homoge- neous at 100.

The recovered catalyst can be reused for another similar experiment. The solvent was removed from the solution and the crude product was purified by distillation. No carboxylic diacid was detected indicating its complete transformation and, as revealed by electronic microscopy analysis of the residue, no ruthenium was left after filtration of the catalyst at room temperature. Thus catalytic addition of adipic 8, succinic 9 and phthalic 10 acids to hex-1-yne and prop-1- yne were investigated and led to the selective formation of diesters 11-15 in 53-94% yieid. The results are reported in Table 1. In experi- ments 4 and 5 (Table 1) the lower yields in enol diesters 14 and 15 were obtained because suc- cinic and phthalic anhydride were formed in 20% and 33%, respectively as secondary prod- ucts. The latter likely resulted from the in- tramolecular reaction of one carboxylic group with one enol ester group of the intermediate with elimination of ketone. All enol diesters 11-15 were fully character- ized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic data. Only derivatives resulting from the Markovnikov addition of the carboxylate were isolated, as indicated by gas chromatography analysis and 'H NMR spectroscopy (C=CH^ at 5~4.6ppm)or'3CNMR(C=CH2 at 6~ 101 ppm and C=CH2 at 5 ~ 156 ppm). Only traces of Z or E compounds resulting from the addi- tion at the C, carbon of terminal acetylenic substrates were detected. This means that the addition of the carboxylate is highly selectively oriented at the C^ carbon of the alkyne by catalyst 3. 5. Recycling of polymeric catalyst 3 The separation of the catalyst 3 from the reaction products is easily achieved by simple filtration. The recycling of 3 is also efficient as the retention of activity of catalyst 3 was ob- served after several catalytic reactions and re- coveries. For example, experiment 1 (Table 1) was performed seven times without significant loss of yield or selectivity in the formation of 11. No darkening of the solution of recovered 3, corresponding to the formation of colloidal Ru(0), was observed after repeated uses. In- frared indicated no significant changes of cata- lyst 3 after six recycles. Moreover, it is possible to use the same recovered catalyst 3 for different catalytic reac- tions. For example no modification of activity was detected during the two following se- quences: run 2 --run 3 -run 2 -> run 3 run 2 -> run 4 -> run 4, and run 1 run 5 -run 5 -^ run 1. These experiments show the possi- bility to work with different carboxylic diacids (aliphatic or aromatic) and different terminal alkynes with only one sample of catalyst 3. In other words, the same sample of catalyst 3 (0.36 g, 0.1 mmol) was able to produce 55 mmol of diesters 12-14 in the seven reactions along the first sequence. 6. Conclusion These results show that the catalytic proper- ties of the ruthenium fragment are not perturbed by the presence of the polymeric ligand in [ R u ( SJL O^CHXCO^PPh ,(CH ^CH 2),,CH ^CH 3)]:, which offers a direct access to enol diesters. The retention of activity, regioselectivity and stability of the catalyst over several cycles al- lows a large scale, cheap access to enol diesters which can be used as activated diesters.
