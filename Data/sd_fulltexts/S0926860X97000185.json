It includes the studies on the phase composition of the catalyst and its transformations under the influence of the changes in redox potential of the gas phase in catalytic reactor, kinetics of the process as well as its molecular mechanism. Keywords: Vanadia-molybdena catalyst; Benzene oxidation; Maleic anhydride; Cation segregation: Active sites 1. Introduction Vapor phase catalytic oxidation of benzene on vanadia-molybdena catalysts was commercialized in 1930s and after the Second World War was supplying the economy with increasingly large amounts of maleic anhydride, an important feedstock for the production of polyesters, paints and varnishes. In the last few decades catalytic oxidation of Ca hydrocarbons, an alternative route to maleic anhydride, using also vanadia-based catalysts became more attractive both from economic and ecological reasons. The writing of the present review is justified by the fact that the physical chemistry of vanadia-molybdena catalyst, the kinetics and mechanism of catalytic benzene oxidation were studied in numerous laboratories thus giving a vast knowledge of this catalytic system which became a model system for the studies of relations between the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, its phase composition, transformations in the course of catalytic reaction and its catalytic activity and selectivity. The importance of the V2Os-MoO3 catalyst for the oxidation of other hydrocarbons should also be stressed. * Corresponding author.

V205-Mo03 system In the vanadia-molybdena catalysts several phases were identified exhibiting different V205fMoO3 molecular ratio and different average oxidation number of cations. Their appearance distinctly depends on the redox potential of surround- ings. Both oxides, vanadia and molybdena, containing cations in their highest oxidation state exhibit evident similarities in their structures. In both cases crystal lattice is built of [MO6] octahedra joined by common corners in such a way that stoichiometry is preserved. Both cations can be easily reduced but owing to its lower reduction potential it is vanadium which is preferentially reduced. Reduction is most frequently accompanied by the formation of shear structures (V,O2,_ 1 and M0,O3,_1 series of oxides). These similarities (and also the close similarity of ionic radii) enable the formation of substitutional solid solutions as well as an intermediate compound, the structure of which may be interpreted as the shear structure of ReO3 lattice with different oxidation states of cations. Fig. 1 shows VEO5-MoO3 phase diagram as proposed in [1] and [2]. The liquidus and solidus curves were obtained on the basis of thermal analysis of the samples prepared by the fusion of appropriate amounts of V205 and MoO3 and they correspond to the equilibria reached at the constant oxygen pressure equal to that in the atmospheric air. In the diagram a vast region of solid solution of MoO3 in V205 (phase a) is seen and an intermediate compound (phase /3) congruently 7 I-- 750 650 611 550 450 350 @ @ I I 20 40 /'5+ MoO3 [ I 60 80 100 [mo[. % MOO3] Fig. l.

Structure of the layers parallel to the (0 0 1) plane in V205 crystal lattice [5]. fusing and forming two eutectic subsystems (one with a phase and one with MOO3). Let us discuss at first the structure of V205. X-ray investigations [3,4] show that o four V-O bonds in one plane are of similar length (1.79-2.02 A), one is much shorter (1.59 A) and hence much stronger. It is considered to be V=O double bond. o The sixth O-V bond is the weakest one being 2.79 A long. (Fig. 2) [5]. This is why the structure of V205 may be most conveniently described as the structure built of [VOs] square pyramids. The pyramids are joined by the common comers or edges thus forming layers, shown in Fig. 2, parallel to the (0 0 1) plane. The apices of the pyramids (V=O) are partly directed above and partly below the layers. The neighboring layers are situated in such a way that the doubly bonded oxygen atoms from one layer occupy positions below square bases of pyramids in the next layer thus completing the coordination number of vanadium atoms to six. It should be observed that in such a structure there exist empty channels directed perpendi- cularly to (0 0 1) and also (0 1 0) planes formed by fourfold oxygen rings in particular layers. Direction of one of the channels is marked by the arrow in Fig. 2. As it will be shown later the channels may be treated as the potential routes of cation diffusion in the V205 lattice. The solubility limit of MoO3 in solid V205 is about 30 mol% at the eutectic temperature 611 and decreases with the decreasing temperature. At 350 it is situated between 10 and 15 mol% MOO3. Molybdena is forming substitutional 226 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 solution in which preservation of the metal to oxygen atomic ratio 2 : 5 must be related to giving off an appropriate amount of oxygen (which is observed in fact during solidification of the oxide melt) and partial reduction of cations (which was also analytically confirmed). Munch and Pierron [6] assumed that it is V4+ which is a well-known species in vanadium chemistry while Mo5+ oxide is rather dubious. The presence of V4+ and the absence of Mo5+ was confirmed by the EPR measurements [7]. The formation of the solid solution can be, therefore, expressed by the equation 2MOO3 ~ 2Mov + 50o + 102 + 2e- (2.1) in which Krtger-Vink symbols are used. Solid solutions, the composition of which may be expressed as (Vl_xMox)2Os, with x<0.2, are orthorhombic similar to pure V205 (a phase) but at higher x they are monoclinic (phase a' ) [8]. In the orthorhombic structure all metal ions within ReO3-type slabs are displaced in the same direction while in the monoclinic one they are pairwise shifted in the opposite directions. The existence of an intermediate compound (phase/3) in the vanadia-molybdena system was first reported by Magneli and Blomberg [9]. They stated that it was the only phase present in the samples obtained at 650-700 containing 44-57 mol% MoO3. In the sample with 36 mol% MoO3 besides phase /3 also phase a was present, while in the sample with 70 mol% MoO3 besides /3 also MoO3 was detected. The authors claim that the composition of the com- pound is likely to correspond to 50 mol% MoO3 i.e. to V2MoOs. Eick and Kihlborg [10] determined the X-ray structure of the sample of this latter composition which was obtained by prolonged heating of an equimolar mixture of V205 and MoO3 in evacuated gold tube for one day at 630. They have shown that the investigated structure consists of ReO3-type slabs infinitely long in two dimensions but only three octahedra thick. These slabs are connected by edge sharing between component octahedra. The ideal arrangement is considerably distorted, mainly by displacements of the metal atoms from the centers of the octahedra. Vanadium and molybdenum atoms are distributed almost, but not quite, statistically over the two non-equivalent positions. On the basis of the structure - as the authors concluded - a homogeneity range V2-xMOl+xO8 where x>0, is expected for this phase. It should be here observed that increasing the number of Mo atoms over Mo/V ratio equal to 0.5 necessitates reduction of an appropriate number of V5+ to V4+. Munch and Pierron [6] investigated a series of vanadia-molybdena mixtures heated at 600 for two weeks or fused at 900 and stated that the sample with V2Os/MoO3 molar ratio 3/4 (57.14 mol% MOO3) exhibited X-ray reflections corresponding to the V2MoO8 (phase /3) sample of Eick and Kihlborg [10]. The deviations from this composition resulted in the additional appearance of the diffraction lines either of MoO3 or phase a. Hence, they concluded that the composition of intermediate compound is rather V9Mo604o than V2MoO8. Similar A. Biela~ski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 227 results were obtained by Bielariski et al. [1] who observed at this composition a maximum on the liquidus curve (Fig. 1) indicating congruent fusion. On the other hand Strupler and Morette [11] when studying the same phase diagram obtained very fiat maximum in the liquidus curve in the composition region between about 35 and 60 mol% MoO3 and assumed that it corresponded to the equimolar ratio of both oxides forming V2MoO8 compound. Also Volkov et al. [12] situated max- imum of the liquidus curve at 1 : 1 molar ratio. Jarrnan et al. [ 13,14] were trying to solve the controversy between both formulas. According to them the/3 phase always exhibits cations/anions ratio corresponding to the formula M308 but the Mo/V ratio does change according to the calcination temperature. The Mo-rich phase limit is (Vo.sMoo.5)308 (0.67 mol% MOO3) in which one third of V atoms is reduced to V4+. Pure fl phase of the composition (Vo.52Mo0.48)308 (63.4 mol% MOO3) was obtained by the authors by heating at 500 the products of NH4VO3nt-(NHa)6Mo7024 mixture decomposition. The air oxidation in such non-equilibrated system occurs: 0.5 + y (V0.sMo0.5)308 ~ (V0.5+yMo0.5_y)308 + 6yMoO3 (2.2) 0.5 At 600 y=0.1 and V9Mo604o is obtained. It should be here noticed that Strupler and Morette [ 11 ] observed different behavior of the samples obtained by fusion and those obtained by sintering and attributed this to the loss of oxygen during solidification of the melt. The portion of the phase diagram corresponding to the higher content of molybdena than in V9Mo604o represents a typical two component phase diagram with eutectics between phase/3 and orthorhombic MOO3, which does not incor- porate vanadium oxide in its crystal lattice. However, it should be mentioned that Khulbe et al. [15] when investigating samples obtained by the calcination of ammonium vanadate and molybdate mixture at 500 found in the X-ray diagrams of the samples containing 2-20 wt% V205 the reflexes of an unknown phase. Later Andrushkevich et al. [ 16] identified in the samples with 87.5-90 mol% MoO3 (also obtained by sintering ammonium vanadate and molybdate mixture) a compound the X-ray pattern of which is almost identical with that of monoclinic Mo4011. The shift in the maximum positions in the XRD pattern and the intensity variations as compared to Mo4011 were attributed to the substitution of one fourth of Mo atoms by V ones. The fact that chemical analysis has shown more than 90% of V atoms reduced to V4+ justified the formula VMo3Ot 1. This compound has been shown to be the main compound in the most active and selective V2Os-MoO3 catalyst for acrolein oxidation [ 17,18]. Molybdenum trioxide, the second main component of V205-MoO3 system, exhibits a layer structure in which slightly deformed [MOO6] octahedra are joined in such a way that in each octahedron three oxygen atoms are common to three different octahedra as it is seen in the section of the layer along bc plane as shown in the upper part of Fig. 3. In the direction perpendicular to the sheet of paper (axis 228 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 Fig. 3. Structure of MOO3: (a) composite layers of [MOO6] octahedra - section perpendicular to the direction of axis a; (b) (0 1 0) plane - 1. position of O atom singly coordinated at the surface, 2. doubly coordinated O atom, 3. triply coordinated O atom [5]. a) each octahedron shares two oxygen atoms with two neighboring octahedra, one before and one on the other side of the sheet. One oxygen atom is coordinated to only one Mo atom forming the shortest metal-oxygen bond (double Mo=O bond). The neighboring layers are kept together by weak intermolecular forces. The (0 1 0) plane to which the layers are parallel is the cleavage plane in MoO3 crystals. The exposed layer forming the (0 1 0) surface in the crystals is shown in the lower part of Fig. 3. It is seen that there are three different positions of O atoms on the surface. In position 1 singly coordinated terminal O atom is situated. Oxygen in position 2 exhibits coordination number two being common for two octahedra. In position 3 coordination number increases to three. It should be observed that in MoO3 structure there are no such channels perpendicular to the layers as those present in V/Os. The magnetic, optical, and electrical properties of VaO5-MoO3 were investi- gated in [7,19-24]. 3. The interaction of V2Os-MOO3 surface with oxygen and benzene Owing to the very fast diffusion into and from the bulk of V205, MoO3 as well as V2Os-MoO3 at temperatures at which catalytic oxidation of benzene occurs the discrimination between the chemisorbed and the lattice oxygen is very difficult. The study of oxygen chemisorbed species was, therefore, possible only at much A. Bielatlski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 229 lower temperatures. The EPR investigations of oxygen chemisorption on pre- reduced supported MoO3 and V205 were undertaken by several investigators [25,26]. According to Shvets et al. [27,28] 02 was the only species forming on partly reduced V205/SIO2 during oxygen chemisorption at -196. Over temperature range -78 to 300 the formation of O- together with 02 ion radical was observed. The adsorbed O- and 02 species were stabilized on 51V4+ ions as it was indicated by the hyperfine structure of EPR signals. According to Yoshida et al. [29] the intensity ratio of the O- and 02 signals does increase with the reduction degree of the V205/SIO2 catalyst. Similar results were obtained with supported MoO3 catalysts. Stability of O2 ions adsorbed on MoO3/SiO2 was reported by Krylov et al. [30] and also by Maksimovskaya [31]. Che et al. [32] observed the formation at 77 and 300 K of ions localized on 95Mo5+ in MoO3/SiO2. However, in the case of MoO3/A1203 on heating from 77 to 300 K another EPR signal also appeared, the hyperfine structure of which indicated the presence of 02 ions stabilized on A13+. Chemisorption of NO on MoO3/SiO2 results in the decomposition of the adsorbed molecules and the formation of O- ions at the catalyst surface [33-35]. Fricke [35] investigated oxygen chemisorption on monolayer V-Mo-O/SiO2 prereduced catalysts (MoN atom ratio 1.7 to 6.6) and observed at room tempera- ture simultaneous formation of 02 (51V) and 02 (96Mo). Both signals decayed at these conditions. However, the O2(Mo) EPR signal initially much stronger than that of O2(V) decayed definitely faster and after some 30-40 min became less intense than the latter decaying only slowly. All the above experiments were carried out using the catalysts in which the reduced V and Mo ions were dispersed in the matrix of the support and there were no interactions between them. Quite different results were obtained with even slightly prereduced unsupported V205 [36,37], MoO3 [38] and V2Os-MoO3 [39,40]. In this case the concentration of reduced cations was much higher and owing to the high availability of electrons oxygen was chemisorbed in the form of diamagnetic 02- ions which is equivalent to the incorporation of oxygen into the external layers of crystallites and no ion radicals, O- and O~-, were detected on the surface. In the samples of V205 in which reduction degree was of the order of 7% the concentration of V4+ as calculated on the basis of chemical analysis was always higher than that determined from the intensity of EPR signals of V4+. This justified the conclusion that besides V4+ ions detectable by EPR there were also present non-Kramers V3+ ions which do not give EPR signals. This conclusion was confirmed by the fact that the intensity of V4+ EPR signal passed over maximum in the course of chemisorption of oxygen at temperatures up to 200, thus showing a two-step oxidation V3+ __.+ V4+ ..._+ V5+ 230 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 in which only the surface or near-to-surface V ions participate. Above 300 the reoxidation of the samples is very fast and the observed signal intensity decreases monotonically to a value corresponding to a very low degree of reduction. It was argued that at these conditions oxidation takes place not only in the surface layers but also in the bulk of V205 crystallites and that diffusion in the solid is the rate determining step of the whole process. Very much similar results were obtained also with slightly reduced V205-MoO3 (3.4-28.0 mol% MOO3, surface area about 50 mE/g) [38,39]. However, on the chemisorption of oxygen two maxima of V4+ EPR signal intensity were observed, thus indicating two different types of paramagnetic centers differing by their rate of oxidation. It was assumed by the authors that the more active center is V3+ ion stabilized by an oxygen vacancy and the less active is V3+ stabilized by Mo6+ ion. The most complicated results were obtained in the case of prereduced non- supported MoO3 in which besides EPR detectable Mo5+ also non-Kramers Mo4+ ions were present but the existence of Mo3+ ions could not be excluded. Owing to some differences in the EPR signals the authors could discriminate four Mo5+ centers of different symmetry. Their different accessibility for oxygen was explained by their localization at the surface or in the bulk of the MoO3 crystallites and also by their different stabilization [38]. Adsorption of oxygen on the V205 samples which were previously standardized by evacuation and oxidation in 02 cycles at 500 was studied by Rey et al. [41]. Adsorption isotherms obtained at temperatures 100-450 exhibited typical shape of the Langmuir isotherm but the saturation corresponded to quite small coverage. The maximal coverage was reached at 250 and was equal to 0=0.015. The final coverage obtained for particular isotherms as plotted against temperature gave a curve with two maxima, at 250 and 350. According to the inter- pretation given by the authors the former was connected with the oxidation of the superficial V4+ ions created during the high temperature evacuation and the latter with the diffusion controlled oxidation of bulk V4+ ones. These results correlate with TPD experiments carried out by Dziembaj [42] who, after a similar training of the samples, has observed oxygen desorption peak at about 170 and also the evolution of oxygen above 400, the intensity of which strongly increased with temperature thus indicating gradual transformation of V205 into V6013. All these experiments show unusually high lability of oxygen in V205 and VEO5-MoO3. This lability was most effectively documented by the investigations of oxygen isotopic exchange in these systems. Novakova [43] listed the data characterizing the isotopic exchange in 18 different solid oxides. Three oxides V205 (investigated at 400-550), MoO3 (600-750) and WO3 (700-800) occupy quite unique position in her Table. While in none of the other oxides the number of oxygen layers in the solid in which the exchange takes place is higher than 10 (average, 3-6 layers) in the above three oxides practically the whole oxygen in the solid can be exchanged. This specific property is explained by the A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 231 ability of the three oxides to undergo easily reduction accompanied by the formation of crystallographic shear defects and in consequence forming lower oxides of Magneli series (as Vn+lO2n+l or MonOan_l). AS it has been shown by Boreskov [44] on the basis of kinetic experiments two mechanisms of hetero- molecular oxygen exchange (exchange with the participation of O atoms both from gas and solid phase) exist. In one of them only one O atom of the solid oxide participates in the exchange of 02 molecule from gas phase (rate constant k~) and in the second one two oxide oxygen atoms participate in the exchange of one O2 molecule from gas phase (rate constant k2). In the former case dissociation of adsorbed O2 molecule is necessary while in the latter the formation of a transition complex composed of four atoms must be assumed or the incorporation of oxygen molecule from gas phase into the solid at the site of two neighboring surface oxygen vacancies with the simultaneous desorption of O2 molecule from another site at the surface. According to [43] both mechanisms can operate in the case of V205, MoO3 and WO3. However, the results obtained in an extensive study of oxygen isotopic exchange on VeOs-MoO3 system carried out by a French-Russian team [45] using two different experimental methods (static and circulating gas methods) led to the conclusion that at temperatures 450-525 the second exchange mechanism involving two surface oxide oxygen atoms is the only mechanism of heteromolecular exchange in these catalysts. Another important conclusion reached by the authors was the state- ment that at the above conditions the rate of oxygen diffusion in the solid was much higher than the rate of heteromolecular isotopic exchange. The activation energy of the exchange which was 45 kcal/mol for V205 and 51 kcal/mol for MoO3 was the highest and equal to 82 kcal/mol in the case of the sample containing 33.3 mol% MoO3. The samples of similar composition also exhibited distinct maximum in the selectivity of the catalytic oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride. The information concerning the adsorption of benzene on V205-MoO3 samples is definitely scarce. Jones et al. [46] studied benzene adsorption on alumina- supported V205 and V2Os-MoO3 catalysts at 288-381 K, i.e. at the conditions which are not very much interesting from the catalytic point of view. The authors determined the differential adsorption heats, which decreased from the values of the order of 60 kcal/mol for small coverage to a value corresponding to the vaporization heat of benzene at coverage higher than a monolayer. Belokopytov [47,48] studied thermoprogrammed desorption of benzene adsorbed at room temperature on a V205-MoO3 catalyst. Two TPD peaks were observed: a strong one at 422 K and a much weaker one at 516 K. The desorption in the former case followed the first-order law, which indicated that it was a monomole- cular process and benzene adsorption occurred without any dissociation. The reaction order determined for the second peak was two and hence desorption involved two adsorbed species. The authors suggested that these were C6H5\" radical and proton. 232 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 4. Cation segregation in V-Mo-O catalysts The phase diagram shown in Fig. 1 [2] allows to determine equilibrium compo- sition of the preparation with given V/Mo ratio at given temperature and under oxygen partial pressure in air. It is obvious that equilibrium phase composition of the preparation of given V/Mo ratio at given temperature would change with change of oxygen partial pressure in surroundings. To determine univocally equilibrium phase composition of any V-Mo-O preparation at given temperature and under given oxygen partial pressure a three-dimensional phase diagram, containing also axis of oxygen partial pressure, would be needed. From such diagram it would be possible to determine the phase changes occurring in V-Mo- O preparation, under the influence of oxidation and reduction processes. Unfortu- nately, such diagram has not been published yet. Nevertheless, it is possible to anticipate some changes in equilibrium phase composition of V-Mo--O preparation if we remember that: (i) oxidation of an oxide can only occur if partial pressure of oxygen in oxide surroundings is higher than equilibrium oxygen pressure, (ii) oxide reduction may occur if oxygen partial pressure in surroundings is lower than equilibrium oxygen pressure. Thus, the slow cooling of oxide under fixed oxygen partial pressure in surround- ings can cause its oxidation. On the contrary, oxide heating under constant oxygen partial pressure should result in its reduction. As redox processes concern mainly vanadium ions [7] one can claim that the lower the partial pressure of oxygen in surroundings is, the lower is the degree of oxidation of vanadium ions at given temperature. Annealing of pure vanadia or molybdena at temperature above Tamman temperature under oxygen pressure equal to or lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in air may result in formation of lower vanadium oxides, e.g. V409 [49], V307 [50], V6013 [51], V204 [52-54] or lower molybdenum oxides, e.g. MO5014 [55], Mo17047 [56]. Annealing of V2Os+MoO3 mixture with Mo : V<6 : 9 in reducing conditions (relatively high temperature and/or relatively low oxygen partial pressure) may cause formation of substitutional solid solution of MoO3 in V205 [2] 6+ 5+ 4+ (Mox V2_2xV~ )205, with the same amounts of V4+ and Mo6+ ions. Oxidation of such solid solution due to the increase of oxygen partial pressure and/or the decrease of temperature should result in diminishing of the content of V4+ and, thus, Mo6+ ions. As can be noticed in Fig. 1, with the decreasing temperature solubility of MoO3 in V205 decreases and/~ phase must be separated [2]. It is obvious that oxidation accompanying cooling of solid solution participates in observed cation segregation leading to the formation of the phases impoverished and enriched in molybdenum with respect to maternal one [2]. Melting of the mixture of MoO3 and V205 with Mo : V=0.67, and its subsequent rapid cooling results in the formation of intermediate compound, V9Mo604o A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 233 4+ 5+ 6+ [V V8 Mo6 040] with each ninth vanadium atom in the IV oxidation state. During the oxidation some V4+ ions turn into V5+ and some Mo6+ atoms have to be given off as MOO3. According to Khulbe [15] the latter is thought to include in the form of solid solution no more than 2 tool% of V205. Commercial V-Mo-O catalysts are usually obtained by decomposition of the mixture of the vanadium and molybdenum salts and promoters at re- latively low temperatures (320-350) in air [57,58]. The metastable systems formed in these conditions contain Na-bronze crystals - non-active in benzene oxidation, and X-ray amorphous MoO3-V205 solid solution (o~ and c~' phases) and VzOs-MoO3 intermediate compound (/3 phase), both active in selective benzene oxidation to maleic anhydride [57]. In conditions of catalytic reaction the catalyst undergoes reduction [58]. Bronze was found to be stable in these conditions [57] and c~, o/ and /3 phases were found to be reduced [58]. The reduction was found to result in the profound changes in the phase composition of the crystals of the active phases, suggesting reduction-induced cation segregation [58]. Loss of molybdenum observed at the reaction conditions [58] was ascribed to sublimation of molybdena which was thought to be formed due to cation segregation in catalyst crystallites. The molybdena sublimation was claimed to be enhanced by water vapor produced in the oxidation of benzene [59]. Several papers were devoted to the segregation phenomena induced by redox processes in V-Mo-O system [60-70]. The published results concern the following points: (i) Position of the zone enriched or impoverished in molybdenum in crystals of c~ and/3 phases subjected to oxidation or reduction [60-62]. (ii) Changes of the position of the zones enriched in molybdenum under the influence of the changes in redox potential of the gas phase [63]. (iii) Mechanism of cation diffusion in c~ and/3 phases [64,65]. (iv) Epitaxial relations between phases in multiphase crystals (hybrid crystals) formed during oxidation or reduction of a and/3 phase crystallites [63-70]. (v) Role of segregation in the formation of the active surface in V-Mo-O catalysts [57,58]. Let us discuss separately particular problems. (i) X-ray microprobe was used to monitor the changes in the chemical composi- tion of the next-to-surface layers in the crystals of o~ [60] and /3 [62] phases. Crystals were obtained by melting the mixture of vanadia and molybdena with proper V : Mo ratio, and cooling the melt with the rate of 2.5/min to 773 K, and next quenching to room temperature by removing from the furnace. Microanalysis was carried out in the same strictly fixed areas (of ca. 2 mm depth) of freshly prepared, oxidized and reduced samples. Oxidation and reduction of the samples were performed by their heating at 723 K in air atmosphere or in vacuum, respectively. The results of analyses are presented in Table 1. They show that oxidation causes an impoverishment and reduction an enrichment in molybdenum of the subsurface layers of the crystals of both phases. This also means that the 234 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 Table 1 X-ray microprobe point analysis of MoO3-V205 samples [60,62] Samplea Site NMJNv Fresh sample After oxidation After reduction A B 1 0.036 0.025 0.064 2 0.049 0.028 0.062 3 0.047 0.024 0.060 1 0.700 0.650 0.700 2 0.720 0.640 0.740 3 0.740 0.650 0.780 aSample A: 10 mol% MOO3-90 mol% V205; Sample B: 57 mol% MOO3-43 mol% V205. oxidation results in enrichment and the reduction in impoverishment in Mo of the deeper layers. The segregation, induced by reduction or oxidation, indicates that cation diffusion is involved in redox processes, although in earlier papers only the anion diffusion was considered to be responsible for them [43,71-76]. As cations migrate toward the surface during the oxidation and in opposite direction during the reduction, the enrichment of the surface in vanadium in the course of oxidation and in molybdenum in the course of reduction was taken as a proof of predominant migration of vanadium ions. The gradient of (Vo)/O ratio was considered as the driving force of cation as well as anion diffusion in t~ and fl phase crystals [60,63]. The surface segregation of vanadium and molybdenum was also studied by XPS method [61 ]. The results concerning much thinner surface layers fully confirmed the previous results. (ii) The oxidation or reduction-induced changes in the chemical composition of particular areas of catalyst crystals were found to cause the appearance of new phases enriched or impoverished in molybdenum [63-70]. The changes of the redox potential of the gas phase were found to result in the changes in positions of these phases in crystals. Such processes were studied for MoO3-V205 solid solution using X-ray powder diffraction [63]. The sample containing 7 mol% MOO3, obtained by melting, was used for the investigation. The content of/3 phase was determined as the ratio of intensities (heights) of (2 0 0) /3 and (2 0 1)a maxima. The sample was first oxidized at 723 K until constant content of/3 phase was achieved. Subsequently it was reduced for 28 h and next oxidized for the same time. Plot of the h(2 o 0)~/h(2 o 1)c~ ratio against time of thermal treatment (oxidation or reduction) was presented in Fig. 4. The increase of the content of/3 phase during oxidation was ascribed to its formation in the bulk of crystals. Initial decrease and subsequent increase of/3 phase content during the reduction was considered as caused by disappearance of/3 phase in bulk due to decrease of molybdenum concentration and then its appearance in surface layers becoming impoverished in A.

The initial vanishing of the/3 phase and then its appearance during the oxidation following the reduction was ascribed to disappearance of/3 phase in surface layers and its next appearance in the bulk of crystals. Thus, it was shown that/3 phase is \"moving\" along c~-/3 hybrid crystals in the direction opposite to that of vanadium diffusion. While vanadium cations migrate toward higher oxygen redox potential the fl phase is moving toward lower one. (iii) Comparison of XRD patterns of the samples of previously melted catalysts (0-54 mol% MOO3) stored as powder in nitrogen for several months with those of the same catalysts additionally stored in air for two years revealed that phase composition of the catalysts undergoes profound changes during their storage in air [64]. As an illustration the changes in the (0 0 1)/3/(0 0 1)o< and (1 0 0)/3/(0 0 1)c~ intensity ratios for the catalysts containing 10 and 30 mol% MoO3 are presented in Table 2. The occurrence of the cation segregation at temperature as low as room temperature shows that the activation energy of cation diffusion is definitely low. The crystal structures of c~ and/3 phases reveal the most probable paths of cation diffusion. In both structures interstitial cavities with diameter of ca. 2.2 A joined by windows of diameter ca. 0.8 ,~ form interstitial channels in [0 1 0] and [0 0 1] directions [64]. Hence, it was expected that cations occupying interstitial positions easily diffuse either directly through these channels or indirectly by a concerted movement through neighboring cation positions. To confirm the cation diffusion along the channels the influence of electrical field directed parallel or perpendi- cular to channels on the rate of cation diffusion was investigated [65]. Electric field was imposed between electron beam entering the crystals in the [0 0 1] direction, and a silver electrode in contact with the (1 0 0) or (0 1 0) faces of the crystals. Electron beam was used simultaneously as a probe for chemical analysis. The results presented in Fig. 5 show that electrical field imposed in [ 1 0 0] direction 236 A. Bielahski, M.

On the contrary, imposing the field in [0 1 0] direction causes a continuous increase of the vanadium concentration in the analyzed areas of/3 phase. In c~ phase vanadium concentration A. Bielahskg M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 237 first increases and then decreases below the initial value. The initial increase of V concentration in a phase and its continuous increase in/3 one were ascribed to the enhancement the vanadium cation diffusion along [0 1 0] interstitial channels by electrical field. On the other hand, the lack of the changes in vanadium concentra- tion under the influence of electrical field imposed in [1 0 0] direction was interpreted as lack of easy cation diffusion in this direction. Posthukhov's [77] and Pantony's [78] investigation of the changes of electrical conductivity and non-stoichiometry in the function of oxygen pressure showed the presence of V4+ interstitial ions in molten V205. The near infrared spectroscopy [79-81] and EPR [79] results showing the presence of undefined one-electron donors in interstitial positions of V205 crystals could now be considered as evidence of the presence of V4+ interstitial ions. The 15-line EPR spectra obtained by Kazansky [82] and Dyrek [83] for polycrystalline samples of diluted solution of MoO3 in V205 are very similar to those assigned by Clows [79] to one-electron donors in interstitial positions. It should be mentioned here that cation segregation induced by redox processes in multicomponent oxide system was first suggested by Hauffe [84] and then Whittingham [85]. It was subject of intensive studies in ceramic oxide systems with the cation vacancy diffusion [86-91] in the 1980s. Cation segregation induced by reduction was also observed in many oxide systems playing the role of the catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation [92-97]. Recently Najbar et al. have under- taken systematical study of the cation segregation induced by redox processes in V205-WO3 [98,99] and V2Os-Sb203 [100] catalysts. (iv) The moving of/3 phase inside c~-/3 hybrid crystals [63] shows that easy diffusion of cations occurs also across the phase boundary. This strongly suggests the presence of the epitaxial or topotactic relation between both contacting phases, which ensures the prolongation into/3 phase of the interstitial channels running in one. The existence of the epitaxial relations can be predicted taking into account the similarity in dimensions of coordination polyhedra in both phases in x and y directions: x=3.84, y=3.56 ,~ for phase c~ [8]; and x=3.88, y=3.61 ,~ for phase L~ [10]. Geometrical considerations lead to the conclusion that the best crystal- lographic fit exists between (0 0 1) faces of both phases. The prolonged room temperature oxidation of a phase results in the formation of the /3 phase with {0 0 l} planes parallel to the best developed (0 0 1)ct surface (Table 2). On the contrary, room temperature oxidation of the sample containing 30 mol% MoO3 results in the formation of hybrids mostly with {h 0 0}/3//{0 0 1 }a. It was shown in several papers [64,67-69] that the change in the orientation of/3 phase is connected with formation of orthorhombic MoO3 top layer. In this case multilayer hybrids are formed with the phase orientation: {0 k O}MoO3//{h 0 0}/3//{0 0 1 }/3//(0 0 1)c~ [69]. The values of linear lattice misfit between consecutive phases of such hybrids calculated similarly as it was done by Vejux and Courtine [101] are presented in Table 3. The examples of crystallographic matching between (0 1 0)MOO3 and (1 0 0)/3 (a), (1 0 0)/3 and (0 0 1)/3 (b) are shown in Fig. 6. The hybrid crystals of 238 A. Bielahski, M.

Dependence of the ratio of the effective a.c. resistance (R~ff=Rc+Rb) of mildly reduced and then oxidized to the effective resistance of mildly reduced catalysts on MoO3 content [64]. the phase orientation: {0 1 0}MOO3//{ 1 0 0}/3 in top layers were expected to be resistant against oxidation. The migration of the anion vacancies in the [0 1 0]MOO3 direction must be strongly hindered by the gaps between two octahedra slabs in MOO3, and cation migration have to be hindered by the lack of the interstitial channels in molybdena as well as in/3 phase in this direction. The comparison of the electrical conductivity of the mildly reduced powdered catalysts with that of the same catalysts stored at room temperature in air atmosphere for two years was used to appreciate evolution of the catalysts during the storage [64]. A plot of the ratio of effective a.c. electrical resistance of oxidized and reduced catalysts, defined as (Rc+Rb)o/(Rc-FRb)r (o -oxidized, r - reduced, c - contact, b - bulk) against catalyst composition is shown in Fig. 7. The higher stability observed for the catalysts containing 30 mol% or more MoO3 than for those containing 20 mol% or less MoO3 was ascribed to the presence of molybdena in top layer of hybrids formed during the reduction of the former one. (v) In the conditions of industrial reactor a and/3 phases, active in selective benzene oxidation, undergo reduction accompanied by cation segregation causing the enrichment of their surface layers in molybdenum. The segregation may lead to the formation of molybdena as the top layer on some hybrid crystals, which evaporates slowly and the catalyst gets impoverished in molybdenum [58]. The extent of such impoverishment is illustrated by the data in Table 4. They concern corundum-supported industrial catalyst containing 30 mol% MoO3, which has been working for 16 months in the upper part of an industrial reactor.

The mild reduction of the crystals of catalyst containing 30 mol% MoO3 was expected to cause the formation of some hybrid crystals with MoO3 top layers. Hence, high catalyst selectivity was ascribed to (0 1 0) MoO3 surface which due to the way of the formation contained some vanadium atoms. As the used catalyst contained ca. 18 mol% MoO3 the hybrid crystals with a and/or b top layers exposing (0 0 1) surfaces have been expected to be predominantly formed due to mild reduction. It was concluded, that (0 1 0)MOO3 surface contain- ing some vanadium cations shows exceptionally high selectivity and rather low activity while, (0 0 1)a~ and/or (0 0 1)fl surfaces show higher activity but lower selectivity to MA. This problem will be discussed in details in Section 7. The initial increase of selectivity and the decrease of total activity of the freshly prepared A1203-supported catalyst containing 30 mol% MOO3, observed by Waugh et al. [102] (Table 5), may also be interpreted as a result of cation segregation induced by the catalyst reduction. The increasing contribution of the vanadium doped (010) molybdena (va+/MoO3) face in total catalyst surface area can be considered as responsible for the changes in catalyst performance. 5. Oxidation of benzene on V205-MoO3 catalysts 5.1. Reaction products and reaction pattern The main products of vapor phase catalytic oxidation of benzene on vanadia- molybdena catalysts are maleic anhydride, carbon oxides CO and CO2, as well as water vapor. Benzoquinone was detected by some authors in the amounts generally not exceeding 2-3% of converted benzene [103-105]. Ahmad [104] observed, in addition, also small amount of phenol besides maleic anhydride and benzoquinone. In this case high surface area V2Os-MoO3 silica-supported catalyst was used and the very low apparent activation energy (Ea=5--6 kcal/mol) indicated that reaction was diffusion controlled. The highest number of secondary products, however as 242 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 traces only, was reported by Krylova et al. [106] who extracted them from an aqueous solution of technical maleic anhydride and identified mass- spectroscopically, p-Benzoquinone, 2-piron, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, phthalic anhydride, anthraquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone and pyrocatequine carbonate were detected. The reaction pattern as proposed by different authors has different forms depending on the number of products taken into account and the assumed participation of parallel and consecutive reactions. It is generally accepted that benzene is oxidized on two parallel routes, one of them is a direct degradation to carbon oxides and the other one is selective oxidation to maleic anhydride. This conclusion is strongly supported by the experiment carried out by Inglot [ 107] who introduced at 450 pulses of benzene on V2Os-MoO3 (30% MOO3) catalyst previously standardized in air at the same temperature. Only in the 10 initial pulses maleic anhydride could be detected and the subsequent production of CO and CO2 slowly increased indicating a gradual activation of the surface. These results indicate that certain amount of chemisorbed loosely bonded oxygen is necessary for the selective oxidation of benzene and also that on the deoxygenated surface only complete degradation of benzene to carbon oxides takes place. This latter process seems to be connected with the bulk reduction of the solid. The simplest reaction scheme was proposed by Hammar [108] who assumed two parallel paths: complete degradation and selective oxidation to maleic anhydride. The latter may be either desorbed or degraded to carbon oxides (Scheme 1). C4H2Os C6H6 k~ ~ CO+CO2+H20 Scheme 1. C6H6 C4H203 ' CO+CO2+H20 C6H402 Scheme 2. A. BielahskL M.

The ratio of rate constants kl : k2 : k3 as determined at 420 was equal to 1 : 0.53 : 0.08. However, the authors considered Scheme 2 to be equivalent to the \"rake scheme\" (Scheme 3). Reaction 1 of Scheme 2 corresponds in Scheme 3 to the fraction of benzoqui- none (Q), the molecules belonging to which were oxidized without desorption, while reactions 3 and 6 correspond to the transformations of benzoquinone which after desorption were readsorbed. This mechanism was also supported by Beydoun et al. [ 105] who observed maxima of the reaction yields of both quinone and maleic anhydride plotted against contact time. Quinone was oxidized to maleic anhydride with selectivity as high as 90% while benzene only in 60%. This result gives also the confirmation of the existence of the direct path of complete oxidation of benzene. The most ample reaction scheme (Scheme 4) was proposed by Ahmad et al. [104,109] Assuming zero-order reaction with respect to oxygen present in an excess and first-order of the reaction of the particular organic reagents the authors evaluated rate constants kl-k9. For VzOs-MoO3 catalyst the apparent activation energies were - as already said - as low as 4-6 kcal/mol (with the exception of reaction 8 for which Ea----17.3 kcal/mol). The Ea values for VeO5~fr203 catalyst were still lower C6H6 kl ' C6HsOH k2 4' ks C6H402 k3 $ k6 ks C4H203 , k4 4, k7 k9 , CO + CO2 + HzO 4 Scheme 4. 244 A. Bielafiski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 (2-6 kcal/mol). Such values clearly indicate that the reactions were diffusion controlled i.e. occurred within the narrow pores of silica-supported catalysts. The problem of the reaction intermediates was also tackled by Inglot who studied on a V2Os-MoO3 (30 mol%) carborundum-supported catalyst the oxida- tion of benzene [110], maleic anhydride [111], phenol [112] and p-benzoquinone [ 113]. He found that in the used conditions the reaction route of selective oxidation of benzene via phenol as intermediate can play only a minor role (1-3%). On the other hand, the analysis of kinetic data led to the conclusion that p-benzoquinone may be the main intermediate in the benzene transformation into maleic anhydride. 5.2. Kinetics of catalytic benzene oxidation Mars and van Krevelen [114] discussed in their now classical paper the catalytic oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons as comprising two independent steps. In one of them hydrocarbon from gas phase reacts with oxygenated surface of the catalyst thus giving oxidation product or products and reduced catalyst surface which is reoxidized by oxygen from gas phase in the second step. The rate of the first step Vr was assumed to be proportional to the hydrocarbon partial pressure PH and to the fraction of surface covered with active oxygen, O, Vr = klPHO. (5.1) The rate of reoxidation v02 was assumed to be proportional to the nth power of oxygen partial pressure P02 and to the fraction of the surface not covered by the active oxygen, Vo2 = kzp~2 (1 - tO). (5.2) At the steady state of catalytic reaction both rates are equal and if/3 molecules of oxygen are needed to oxidize one molecule of hydrocarbon we can write /3klPHtO = k2p~92 (1 - tO) (5.3) and hence tO = k2p~2. (5.4) /3klpH + kzp~2 The substitution of Eq. (5.4) into Eq. (5.1) gives us the overall rate of the process: = -- + -- (5.5) vr 1 klPH2 k2p~:\" The validity of this equation with n=l for the oxidation of benzene was confirmed by the experiments carried out by Mars and van Krevelen. It should be mentioned that this type of equation was also valid in the case of oxidation of A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 245 naphthalene and anthracene and that in all three cases the value of rate constant of reoxidation step k2 was identical. Mars and van Krevelen did not specify which kind of active oxygen participates in the catalytic reaction: chemisorbed or lattice oxygen. However, they believed that it is the doubly bonded oxygen in V=O vanadyl surface groups. They also observed that in the steady state of reaction a certain degree of surface reduction must always be present. Otherwise the process will be stopped. This has been confirmed by Bielafiski and Inglot [115] who studied the effect of catalysts' reduction on their activity and selectivity in benzene oxidation. It has been shown that non-supported V205 catalyst (obtained by fusion of the oxide) reached its highest activity and selectivity when its composition was approaching that of VaO4. Similarly V205-MoO3 catalysts increased their activity and selectivity parallel to the reduction of V5+ to V4+. The kinetic equations expressing the results obtained by different authors collected by Inglot [116] and supplemented with the information concerning the type of reactor used are given in Table 6. It is seen that the authors working with differential or integral constant flow reactors obtained good fit of the experimental results using the equations of the same shape as that proposed by Mars and Van Krevelen. Ioffe and Lyubarski [117] used a circulating flow reactor in which the dependence of the kinetics on maleic anhydride partial pressure could be inves- tigated. In their conditions reaction order with respect to oxygen was 2 at oxygen concentration in the gas phase lower than 4x 10-4 mol/dm3 and zero at oxygen concentrations higher than this value. As it is also seen from Table 6 the rate of benzene oxidation was inversely proportional to 0.78 power of maleic anhydride concentration and the concentration of benzene appeared twice in the experimental kinetic equations raised to the power of 0.78 and 0.71. Generally one can state [116] that in vast pressure region Mars and van Krevelen equation or an analogical one with Po2 raised to 1/2 power is preferred. For low benzene pressures and oxygen pressure about 21 kPa benzene catalytic oxidation can be regarded as a reaction of first-order with respect to benzene and zeroth-order with respect to oxygen. 5.3. The effect of catalyst composition on its activity and selectivity Both the activity and selectivity of vanadia-molybdena catalysts in benzene oxidation depend on the number of factors: phase and chemical composition of the catalyst, the degree of its reduction, the presence of promoters, the support, the method of preparation and pretreatment etc. No clear-cut discrimination between the particular effects can be done at present. However some correlation may be proposed. Generally, the activity and selectivity of undoped and fully oxygenated V205 is poor and a certain degree of reduction is necessary to activate it. Such reduced catalyst represents frequently a mixture of lower oxides which is active and usually non-selective. The pristine lower oxides of both series VnO2n and VnOzn-I are 246 A. Bielahski, M.

Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 active without any pretreatment [126] and the highest activity was obtained in the case of V204 [ 126,127] although in the series VnOzn-a a second weaker maximum of activity was observed for Vat7 [127]. The selectivity of vanadium oxides could be strongly improved by doping them with MOO3. The enhancement of selectivity by molybdena introduced into vanadia depends on the concentration of the dopant. In the case of supported V2Os-MoO3 or non- supported but obtained by the decomposition of appropriate mixture of ammonium salts a fiat maximum of activity and selectivity was obtained at 25-40 mol% MoO3 [103,128-130] which roughly corresponds to the solubility limit of MoO3 in solid V205 (phase ~). In the case of fused bulk V205-MoO3 catalysts two effects overlap: the reduction of V5+ to V4+ and the change in concentration of molybdena. In more weakly reduced catalysts the first effect predominated and the activity was determined by the actual concentration of V4+ in the solid. However, after prolonged reduction maximum of activity and selectivity at about 30 mol% MoO3 was observed [ 131 ]. It should be noticed that in most of industrial catalysts V2Os/MoO3 molar ratio is similar. The industrial catalysts for benzene oxidation to maleic anhydride contain according to patent literature V205 and MoO3 but also the oxides of P, Ag, Na, Li, K, Ti, B, Ta and Sn acting as promoters [132]. However, the number of papers reporting physico-chemical studies of the effect of third component in vanadia- molybdena catalysts is limited. The effect of P205 additives to the carborundum-supported catalyst containing 30 mol% MoO3 was investigated by Inglot [133]. In this study the activity in benzene conversion decreased parallel to the increasing concentration of P205 but the selectivity passed over maximum at about 3-4 mol% Pets. A linear correlation was observed between the selectivity and apparent activation energy of benzene conversion. In a later paper the same author [ 134] indicated the possibility of such correlation if two parallel reactions the sum of which gives the total conversion differ by their particular rate constants and activation energies. The enhancement of selectivity by the 1 mol% additive to the fused catalyst containing 28.5 mol% MoO3 was also reported in [135]. The sample contained a certain amount of glass. After a year devitrification was observed and also distinct drop in activity and selectivity. The effect of additives of silver oxide was studied using vanadia-molybdena catalysts obtained either by fusion [136,137] or by the calcination of samples prepared by evaporation from hydrochloric acid solution [ 138] or evaporation from oxalic acid solutions [139]. In all above cases V2Os/MoO3 molar ratio was close to 7 : 3. The predominant phase was a phase, besides which in some cases also/3 phase appeared. In the samples with AgzO concentration as low as 1% no any additional phase was present which indicates solid solution formation. However, at somewhat higher content of silver either AgVMoO6 (bronze) or Ag2M04013 phase was detected depending on the applied procedure of synthesis. Silver did not affect visibly the activity of the catalysts but at low content distinctly improved the A. Biela~ski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 249 selectivity. On the other hand in the presence of silver containing new phases the selectivity was much worse than in the case of undoped catalyst. This effect was attributed to the high activity of such compounds in the catalytic oxidation of maleic anhydride to the carbon oxides [140]. The effect of very small amounts of silver was studied in [141]. In this investigation vanadia-molybdena catalysts obtained by the fusion of oxides were rendered more selective by impregnating them with small amounts of AgNO3 solution and subsequently calcining at 700 K. Selectivity enhancement was the strongest (from 27.3% to 49.5% at practically unchanged activity) when catalyst containing 28.5 mol% MoO3 was doped with 5.9 10-2 mol Ag per 1 g of catalyst. This optimal concentration corresponded to 1 Ag atom per 1000 (V+Mo) atoms. The XPS spectrum of such catalyst did not contain peak characteristic of silver. This indicated that Ag atoms were mostly incorporated into the subsur- face layers or were present at the surface in the form of small number of aggre- gates which might be missed during XPS experiments. However, subsequent scanning microscope and electron probe examination did not uncover any silver aggregates. The effect of sodium containing additives is not unambiguously cleared. The addition of 0.89 mol% of Na20 to the fused V2Os-MoO3 catalyst resulted in a distinct reduction of the catalytic activity [136]. At 9.4 mol% Na20 the predo- minant phase was Na-V-Mo-O bronze and the catalyst became still less active and selective. On the other hand some effective industrial catalysts were reported to contain Na20. The study of such catalyst was already mentioned in Section 2. The selectivity of benzene oxidation depends also on the temperature. Chrzaszcz et al. [ 132] described the behavior of an industrial catalyst. When temperature was raised its selectivity passed over a fiat maximum and subsequently with further increase of temperature gradually decreased. The same authors studied also the effect of catalyst bed length (0.3-3 m) using a constant flow reactor of the same size and heating conditions as a unit tube in the industrial reactor. In the initial section of the tube about 1 m long 90% of benzene was converted to yield ~60% of maleic anhydride. Over the remaining section of the tube the overall conversion of benzene and maleic anhydride yield increased to 98% and 74%, respectively, but only small increase in the production of carbon oxides (from 20% to 24%) was observed. 6. Molecular mechanism of the catalytic benzene oxidation The first hypothetical molecular reaction scheme of benzene oxidation was proposed by Dolgov [142]. It comprised the reactions shown in Scheme 5. Germain [143] considered hydrogen abstraction in para positions to be the first step in the transformation of benzene molecule. Subsequently oxygen addition to the resulting radical would occur. 250 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 OH OH O O O O 7.1 Scheme 5. On the other hand, Dmuchovsky [121] suggested that formation of peroxy intermediates, (~) and ~]~, by addition of molecular oxygen to the benzene ring, is the rate limiting step in selective benzene oxidation. This suggestion was strongly supported by Petts and Waugh [102]. They oxidized quinone, benzene and hydroquinone on V2Os-MoO3/A1203 catalyst containing 30 mol% MoO3 and found that the selectivity to maleic anhydride was equal to 3-5%, 60% and 60%, respectively. The same selectivity to MA in benzene and hydroquinone and small one in quinone oxidation was taken as confirmation that hydroquinone, and not quinone, is an intermediate in selec- tive benzene oxidation to MA. The logical consequence of this finding was accepting peroxidic adduct as the first product of oxygen attack on the benzene molecule. Petts and Waugh [102] also suggested that quinone is an intermediate in non-selective benzene oxidation and proposed a scheme of reactions (Scheme 6). Quantum-chemical calculations [144-146] fully supported the formation of peroxide adduct as one of the possible results of electrophilic attack of oxygen on benzene molecule. However, they showed that different products can be formed depending on the direction of the approach and mutual orientation of the reacting OH OH O\" (a)lO~ o (8) 0 O~ ~. 7.2 Scheme 6.

Pathways of the reaction of the oxygen molecule with benzene [145]. molecules, as well as on the mode of oxygen activation. If the oxygen molecule with the axis lying in the plane of benzene ring and being parallel to the side of the ring (Fig. 9 I) approaches this side the peroxide intermediate can be formed which then rearranges into o-hydroquinone. On the other hand, if oxygen molecule with axis perpendicular to benzene ring approaches the side of benzene molecule (Fig. 9 II) the cleavage of C-C bonds in rings occurs and two carbon atoms are pulled away by 02 molecule to form C202H2 fragment. C202H2 fragment as well as C4H4 one formed by the rest of benzene ring are expected to be highly active intermediates of the total oxidation. When oxygen molecule with the axis parallel to the diagonal of the ring approaches benzene molecule along the reaction pathway perpendicular to the ring and passing through its center (Fig. 9 III), O-O bridge is formed between 1,4 carbon atoms. The rearrangement by insertion of oxygen into C-H bonds leads to p-hydroquinone formation, which in agreement with Scheme 6 can convert to maleic anhydride by second electrophilic attack of oxygen molecule, or to quinone and next to total oxidation products by interaction with adsorbed O- species or lattice 02- ions. Non-activated oxygen molecule, approaching the benzene ring along the reaction path in the plane of the ring, is forced to become oriented perpendicularly to the ring plane being energetically the most favorable because the SOMOs of 02 molecule overlap with HOMO and LUMO of benzene [ 146]. While, for the activated 02 molecule with stretched O-O bond the position parallel to ring seems to be favorable. 252 A. Biela~ski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 7. Active sites in benzene oxidation On the basis of structural considerations Tarama et al. [147] suggested that double bonded oxygen atoms in V=O groups of V205 are responsible for selective benzene oxidation. As shown in Fig. 2 such atoms are exposed and easily accessible on the (0 0 1) face, generally best developed in V205 crystals. Although V=O bond is the shortest and hence the strongest of all vanadium-oxygen bonds in V205, this O atom was considered, apparently for geometric reason, to be the most reactive one. Tarama's hypothesis was accepted in many later papers. Trifiro and Pasquon [148,149] generalized this suggestion assuming that the presence of double bonded oxygen at the surface of vanadia, molybdena, vanadates and molybdates is necessary for the selective oxidation of different hydrocarbons. Weiss et al. [150] proposed a mechanism of selective benzene oxidation in which C6H6 molecules are adsorbed in the first stage of reaction on the double bonded oxygen atoms. Moriata et al. [151] as well as Grussenmeyer [152] assumed that the strength of M=O double bond is an important factor controlling the activity of the V205 and MoO3 catalysts in benzene oxidation. Bielafiski and Inglot [153] investigating IR spectra of V205 and V2Os-MoO3 catalysts obtained by the fusion of the oxides claimed that the fresh catalysts exhibiting a distinct peak at 1025 cm-1 characteristic for the V=O group showed only weak catalytic activity and were non-selective. In contrast, the same catalysts when reduced in benzene vapors and not exhibiting 1025 cm-1 peak were active. Witko et al. [ 154] studied, by quantum chemical calculations, the activity of the sites present on (0 0 1) V205 surface with respect to hydrogen adsorption and OH desorption. They stated that hydrogen is bonded quite strongly to the vanadyl sites and rather weakly to the bridging oxygen atoms. Such results, according to the authors, indicate that nucleophilic oxidation occurs rather on bridging oxygen sites. The comparative studies of the adsorption at 623 K of benzene (B), toluene (T), pyridine (P), and 3-methyl pyridine (MP) on polycrystalline V205 samples [155] show that benzene is practically not adsorbed at 623 K as compared to the other hydrocarbons (Table 7). Belokopytov [47] did not find either adsorbed benzene at temperature higher than 516 K at the surface of vanadia-molybdena catalysts. Lucas et al. [156] found that the amount of the adsorbed benzene molecules on the surface of catalyst containing 30 mol% MoO3 was very low and did not exceed 4 1011 cm-2, independent of temperature. It seems, therefore, that selective benzene oxidation occurs due to interaction between molecular species of adsorbed oxygen and benzene molecules adsorbed on peculiar places of catalyst Table 7 Concentrations (mol/cm2) of adsorbed benzene (B), toluene (T), pyridine (P), and 3-methylpyfidine (NIP) on V205 [155] Temp.

The species of adsorbed oxygen seem to be responsible for the catalyst selectivity and activity. As it was shown by Anderson [155], terminal oxygen atoms on (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) surfaces of V205 (and probably also the analogous ones on (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) of c~~ and ,/3 as well as on (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) of MOO3) forming strongly bonded OH groups are useless in benzene oxidation. Therefore (0 0 1)o~, (0 0 1)c~, (0 0 1)/3 and (0 1 0) MoO3 faces can only be taken into account in discussion of benzene oxidation over V205-MoO3 catalysts. The distribution of double bonded oxygen atoms on these faces is considered by Najbar et al. [157] as a factor determining the adsorbed oxygen species. In Fig. 10 the illustration of orthorhombic structure of V205 [3], monoclinic stmcture of ~ phase [8], and monoclinic structure of/3 phase [ 10] are shown. As can be seen, the best developed (0 0 1) surface of V205 and of a' phase are composed of the double slabs of square pyramids formed by edge sharing, with apices above or below the surface. In V205 structure the pyramids with apices in one direction formed double bands (Fig. 10 (a)). While, in cd phase chains of pyramids with apices above the surface are joined by comers with chains with apices below the surface (Fig. 10 (b)). It is obvious that only cations inside square pyramids with apices below the surface can serve as adsorption sites. Thus, the bands of pyramids with apices below the surface in V205 correspond to rows of the active sites, that favor the dissociative oxygen adsorption. On the other hand, the dissociative adsorption on the single row of adsorption sites of c~' phase may only be expected if the axis of oxygen molecule approaching the surface is parallel to [0 1 0]a' direction. The 02 molecules with another orientation would be expected to form O~ species. The structures of/3 phase and MoO3 can be considered as built from MO6 octahedra. The first is visualized in Fig. 10 (c) and the second one in Fig. 3. At the (0 0 1) surface of/3 phase crystals cations are either octahedrally or pentahedrally coordinated. The conditions for non-dissociative and dissociative oxygen adsorption, as compared to the above two cases, are intermediate. There are not potential oxygen adsorption sites on the best developed (0 1 0) surface of MoO3 (Fig. 3). All metal atoms are doubly bonded with surface oxygen atoms. Thus, selective benzene oxidation should not be expected over stoichiometric MOO3. This explains poor selectivity in benzene oxidation over MoO3 catalysts, observed by Laugier [158], Gmssenmeyer [152] and Najbar et al. [157]. On the other hand, in agreement with Gmssenmeyer's suggestion [152] V atoms may incorporate in (0 1 0) MoO3 surface without deep lattice reconstruction, necessary for the bulk V205-MoO3 solid solution formation, as it is shown in Fig. 11. Incorporation of vanadium in the form of V4+ ions (V4+/tMoO3) is equivalent with the formation of adsorption sites similar to those in V205, c~, a~ and/3 phases (see Fig. 10) [ 157]. The presence of isolated V4+ adsorption sites creates exceptionally favorable conditions for molecular but not dissociative oxygen adsorption. Thus, the high selectivity in oxidation of benzene may be expected over molybdena catalyst containing small amount of vanadia. In reality a maximum of selectivity was observed by Najbar et al. [157] for the supported catalyst containing 5 mol% 254 A. Bielahski, M.

Dependence of benzene conversion and selectivity to maleic anhydride on composition of corrundium supported catalyst [157]: (+) conversion, (*) selectivity. phases according to their hypothetical selectivity, anticipated from the above consideration of the structure of the basal faces, can be written as V4+/MoO3 > ctI > fl > o~ = V205 > MOO3. Comparison of Fig. 1 and Fig. 12 allows to propose experimental sequence of the faces according to decreasing selectivity: V4+/MoO3 > oz ~ o/~ fl > V205 > MOO3. Both sequences are very much similar. The best selectivity in both cases is exhibited by molybdena catalyst containing as small an amount of vanadia as 5 mol%, and the poorest by undoped molybdena. Some differences in the positions of c~, c~p and fl phases may be explained by the fact that in the working catalyst which is partially reduced segregation of cations and formation of new phases at 256 A. Bielahski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 the surface occur. In the catalyst containing 10 mol% MoO3 the surface can be in reality covered with c/phase richer in molybdenum, and in catalysts containing 34-45 mol% MoO3 /3 phase may be predominant on catalyst surface. While, segregation in the catalysts containing 60 mol% and more MoO3 may only result in V4MoO3 top layer formation. Increase of the selectivity with the increase of molybdena content up to 95 mol% and simultaneous decrease of benzene con- version was ascribed to decreasing concentration of V4+ sites resulting in decrease of the surface capability for dissociative 02 adsorption. In agreement with Lucas et al. [159], small constant amount (6xl012 molecule/cm2) of MA is strongly adsorbed (at 340-350 AHads= 104.2 kJ/mol) on catalyst surface in a large range of temperature and its desorption (Edes= 170--181 10/mol) is thought to be the rate determining step of selective oxidation. The V4concentration on (0 1 0) V4+/ MoO3 surface seems to be optimal in catalyst containing 95 mol% MOO3. In this case most of the adsorbed benzene molecules are converted to MA. Due to long residence time of these molecules on the active sites, benzene conversion is the lowest. The increase of benzene conversion and decrease of the selectivity to MA with the further increase of the Mo content in catalyst was ascribed to insufficient amount of 02 ions for MA formation and thus to increase of the amount of the free sites for benzene adsorption due to quick desorption of the products of total benzene oxidation undergoing easy desorption. The lattice oxygen, most probably bridging one [154], is thought to take part in non-selective oxidation over catalysts with the highest molybdenum content. 8. Conclusions Depending on V : Mo ratio and redox potential of gas phase several different phases appear in the V-Mo-O system. The V2Os-MoO3 catalyst for selective benzene oxidation to maleic anhydride is composed of MoO3-V205 solid solution (c~ or o/phases) and V205-MoO3 intermediate compound (/3 phase). Due to high mobility of oxygen ions and easy diffusion of vanadium cations along the interstitial channels, c~, c~I and/3 phases undergo deep evolution under the influence of the changes in redox potential. The formation of the new phases enriched or impoverished in vanadium occurs as a result of oxidation or reduction- induced cation segregation in the pristine phases. In reducing atmosphere the phases enriched in molybdenum are formed in the top layers of the crystals. In the working catalyst such segregation process frequently leads to molybdena forma- tion at the surface of the catalyst crystals. Due to distinct volatility of this oxide at elevated temperature the catalyst gradually loses molybdenum which is accom- panied by the decrease of the selectivity to maleic anhydride. Thus, the chemical and phase compositions of the working catalyst differ from those of the catalyst freshly prepared. Catalyst activation is always connected with certain degree of its reduction. A. Biela/tski, M. Najbar/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 223-261 257 The general reaction pattern of the catalytic benzene oxidation comprises two main parallel or parallel-consecutive reaction routes leading to selective oxidation to maleic anhydride or complete benzene degradation to carbon oxides and water vapor. However, depending on the conditions different authors indicated the possibility of the formation of small amounts of benzoquinone and phenol. The kinetics of catalytic benzene oxidation has been found in most cases to conform with kinetic equations derived from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism assuming two steps: the oxidation of benzene accompanied by the reduction of the catalyst and the reoxidation of the latter. The earlier suggestion that the doubly bonded oxygen in the surface vanadyl groups V=O in a and a~ phases is the species active in the selective oxidation of benzene was not confirmed either by experimental or by theoretical research. Dmochovsky's idea that the first step in the activation of benzene molecule is the formation of the peroxy species containing 0-O bridge between 1,4 carbon atoms in the aromatic ring, developed more recently by Petts and Waugh, has found a strong support in the quantum-chemical calculations of the possible reaction paths. Such mechanism needs at least transient formation of O~ species at the catalyst surface. According to Anderson terminal oxygen atoms on side surfaces of the catalyst crystals, forming strongly bonded OH groups, are useless in benzene oxidation. Thus, the best developed (001)a, (001)a~, (001)/3 and (010) V4+/MoO3 surfaces are considered to be active in this process. The distribution of double bonded oxygen atoms on active surfaces is discussed as a factor determining the mode of oxygen adsorption. The formation of O2 species is considered to be more probable, while less probable is the dissociation of the adsorbed oxygen molecules. Thus, the single adsorption sites on (010) faces of V4+/MoO3 are taken as most suitable for molecular species formation. O~ species are expected to occur more frequently on the basal face of a~ phase with single rows of adsorption sites than on ~ and/3 ones with higher concentration of adsorption sites. The double bonded oxygen atoms on basal faces of a, c~~,/3 and molybdena hamper benzene molecules in approaching adsorption sites. Thus, benzene adsorption is thought to take place at the crystal corners or edges. Long residence time of maleic anhydride on the catalyst surface causes that highly selective catalyst, exposing (010) vS+/MoO3 face, shows extremely low activity in benzene oxidation. The predominance of molecular species in oxygen adsorbed on (001)c~' face causes that the catalyst composed of hybrid crystals exposing this face shows relatively high selectivity with simultaneous reasonably high activity.
