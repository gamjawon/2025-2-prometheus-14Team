Influence of Cerium on the Stability of Copper-Based Oxychlorination Catalyst CHEN Zhitao, HAN Minghan*, WANG Dezheng, WEI Fei Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Reaction Engineering and Technology, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China Abstract: The influence of the presence of cerium in the copper-based catalyst for HCl oxychlorination was investigated by ICP-AES and XRD characterization. Cerium chloride was transformed to cerium oxide at the beginning of the reaction, which supplied oxygen for the reaction. The catalyst was deactivated during a 300 h duration test. This was because 86% of the cerium had reacted with the carrier to form an inert phase. CeO 2 crystallites also grew during the reaction, which also led to the deactivation of the copper-based catalyst. Key words: oxychlorination; cerium; oxygen storage; deactivation � The catalytic oxidation of hydrogen chlorine to produce chlorine was first discovered by Deacon in 1868 [1], which gave the possibility to treat large amounts of the by-product HCl from many chlorination processes. However, the method did not achieve wide industrial use because the catalyst was easily deactivated. A copper-based catalyst is commonly used in the oxychlorination process. It often includes the compounds of alkali metals like K, Na, and rare earth metals like La [2,3] and Ce as co-catalysts. The deactivation of the copper-based catalyst is mainly due to the volatilization of main active metal chloride [4]. The catalytic activity and thermal stability can be improved by adding Na or K [5] chloride. Liu et al. [6] found that the addition of KCl inhibited the interaction between copper chloride and the carrier in the process of ethane oxy- chlorination. Moreover, it promoted the transformation from Cu 2+ to Cu + to improve the catalytic performance. A previous research has reported that the oxychlorination of HCl was controlled by the oxygen partial pressure [7]. Cerium oxide is a commonly used oxygen storage material [8]. When introduced into the copper-based catalyst, it increased the concentration of superficial oxygen on the catalyst and accelerated the reaction rate. The influence of cerium on the stability of the cop- per-based catalyst has not been reported. The present study investigated the effect of cerium content on the catalytic activity and detected its change in the catalyst before and after the reaction. The focus is on the stability of the catalyst in order to study the deactivation mechanism. The catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation of -Al 2 O 3 . The raw active ingredients were pure CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O, KCl, and CeCl 3 ·7H 2 O. The active ingredients were dissolved in deionized water by heating and mixing, and the mixture was then dried and ground. The impregnated catalyst contained 10% copper, with an equal molar ratio of copper and potassium. The average diameter of the catalyst pellets was 50 m. A quartz tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm was used as the reactor to test the catalyst activity. The HCl conversion was calculated by titrating the total amount of Cl 2 in the exit stream. Cl 2 reacted with KI in water to generate iodine, which can be determined by standard analytical titration using sodium thi- osulfate. The element contents of the catalyst were determined by ICP-AES (VISTA-MPX, Varian). The catalyst samples were dissolved in nitric acid in a WX-4000 microwave digestion system (Shanghai EU), in which only part of the samples could be dissolved. The comparative samples were dissolved in nitric acid first, and the undissolved part was treated with boric acid and sodium carbonate at 920 °C in a platinum crucible until the residual material was dissolved completely. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 Advanced Instrument using a Ni filter and Cu K . radiation. CHEN Zhitao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(10): 951–953 The influence of cerium content on HCl conversion is shown in Fig. 1. The catalytic activity was clearly improved. When the cerium content was increased from 0 to 1.35%, the conversion of HCl increased from 40% to 65%. The XRD spectra of the catalysts before and after the reaction in Fig. 2 showed that the intensity of KCuCl 3 peaks nearly disappeared after the reaction, which might attribute to the destruction of its crystal and/or its high dispersion on the carrier. Cerium chloride that existed with different amounts of water ligands, e.g. CeCl 3 ·6H 2 O was transformed to cerium oxide within 1 h. The crystal structure of cerium oxide is the fluorite structure [9]. There was an equi- librium between its oxide oxygen and the oxygen atmosphere, which made it possible to deposit and supply active oxygen to it during the reaction. Fukui et al. [10] had observed the surface oxygen atoms of cerium oxide by non-contact atomic force microscopy and showed that the surface was terminated by oxygen. The fluorite structure was stable although some oxy- gen atoms were lost to generate defects on the surface of the crystal, which was beneficial for the adsorption and release of oxygen. Therefore, added cerium promoted the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface. The adsorbed oxygen acceler- ated the process of Cu + oxidation to Cu 2+ , which was the rate-determining step of this reaction. Thus, the activity was much increased. To evaluate the stability and understand the deactivation of the copper catalyst, a continuous reaction of more than 300 h duration was carried out. The HCl conversion profile showed three stages, which is presented in Fig. 3. The HCl conversion was about 75% during the first 100 h stage (I), and then the catalytic activity declined rapidly in stage II to an HCl con- version of 50% in 50 h. In the third stage (III), the deactivation rate became slower, with the HCl conversion decreasing from 50% to 40% in 150 h. Many metal chlorides have high vapor pressures and are easily sublimated at high temperatures. To see if this is the cause of deactivation, the contents of the metal elements on the fresh catalyst and the catalyst used for 300 h were measured by ICP-AES. The results are shown in Table 1. The copper and potassium contents showed almost no change after the reac- tion, and the Cu/K mole ratio was still 1. On the other hand, the content of cerium that could be dissolved by nitric acid after the 300 h reaction was only 0.39%. However, the total cerium content (including that dissolved by boric acid and sodium carbonate) was only slightly changed. Obviously, the forms of Cu and K existence in the used catalyst were the same as in the fresh catalyst because they could be dissolved by nitric acid and detected by ICP-AES. After the reaction, 86% of the ce- rium could not be dissolved by nitric acid in the microwave digestion system, while the total cerium content did not change. It is probable that cerium oxide had combined with the carrier to form an inert phase that could not be dissolved by Fig. 1. Influence of cerium content on catalytic activity of Cu-based catalyst. Reaction conditions: Cu = 10%, Cu/K molar ratio = 1, 400 °C, 0.11 MPa, HCl/O 2 molar ratio = 1.5, HCl WHSV = 1.25 h 1 . Fig. 2. XRD spectra of fresh and used catalysts used for different times. (1) Fresh; (2) No Ce, 7.5 h; (3) 1 h; (4) 300 h. Fig. 3. Stability of the catalyst during long-term operation. Reaction conditions: 400 °C, 0.11 MPa, HCl/O 2 molar ratio = 1, HCl WHSV = 0.97 h 1 . CHEN Zhitao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(10): 951–953 nitric acid. The cerium on the catalyst that can be dissolved by nitric acid after the 300 h reaction decreased from 2.70% to 0.39%, as the HCl conversion decreased by 25% in the same period. The residual activity is about equal to that due to a catalyst that had added to it a 0.39% amount of cerium. In other words, the cerium dissolvable by nitric acid had a great influ- ence on the catalytic activity. Cerium that combined with the carrier to form an inert phase cannot be dissolved by nitric acid, so that it cannot supply oxygen in the reaction and does not contribute to the catalytic activity. In addition, cerium chloride with water ligands in the cata- lyst transformed to cerium oxide quickly under the reaction conditions as shown in Fig. 2. As the reaction proceeded, the peaks of the fluorite phase increased in intensity, which indi- cated the growth in particle size of the fluorite phase. Then, its dispersion on the catalyst decreased, which decreased the ad- sorption and transfer of the oxygen on the catalyst. Thus the catalyst activity declined. In conclusion, the main role of cerium oxide added to a copper-based oxychlorination catalyst is to supply oxygen during the process of producing chlorine from HCl by catalytic oxidation. The catalytic activity increased with the cerium content. The added cerium slowly reacted with the carrier to form an inert phase, which caused a deactivation of the cata- lyst. The particle size of the fluorite phase grew as the reaction proceeded. In order to improve the stability of the copper-based oxychlorination catalyst, the formation of the inert phase by CeO 2 and the carrier must be prevented, and the crystal size growth of the fluorite phase must be restrained.
