T. WENG, P. RUIZ, B. DELMON Unite de Catalyse et Chimie des Materiaux Divises, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Place Croix du Sud 1, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium) and D.DUPREZ Laboratoire de Chimie IV, Catalyse en Chimie Organique CNRS, Av. Recteur Pineau, 86022, Poitiers Cedex (France) (Received June 13,1988; accepted January 11,1989) Summary Mechanical mixtures of Mo^Oy and ^O-labelled (as 25%) a-Sb204 and the pure oxides are contacted with propene in the absence of molecular oxygen. a-Sb204 alone is totally inactive. Acrolein, CO and CO; are formed on Mo03 and the mixtures. The oxidation products are ^0 labelled when a-Sb204 is present, proving that a migration of oxygen from a-Sb204 to Mo03 takes place. The mobile (spillover) oxygen species brings about two effects: (i) direct reaction with propene and (ii) increased rate of incorpora- tion of Mo03 lattice oxygen. This second effect corresponds to a remote control mechanism, namely the creation and/or regeneration of reaction sites by spillover oxygen. Introduction The existence of spillover phenomena is now widely accepted. How- ever, the extent to which these phenomena have a bearing on catalytic processes is still poorly appreciated. The only exception is coke formation and coke removal in catalytic reforming and similar reactions, where spill- over hydrogen has been shown to play a predominant role. The laboratory in Louvain-la-Neuve has recently discovered very intense cooperative phe- nomena between separated phases in catalytic reactions involving oxygen: selective oxidation of isobutene to methacrolein [1-4] and oxygen-aided dehydration of N-ethyl formamide [5, 6]. These results led to the proposal of a remote control mechanism, namely creation or modification of active sites on a given phase by the action of spillover oxygen emitted by a second (separate) phase. The core of the explanation of the remote control being oxygen mobility, it is necessary to find direct evidence of spillover in the catalytic mixtures used in the above-mentioned experiments. The results reported in this publication aim at providing such proof. 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 350 The migration of oxygen species has been postulated by several authors, especially in the case of metal catalysts. Ekstrom et al. found that the oxida- tion of UF4 was greatly enhanced when in contact with a catalyst, namely Pt supported on J-A\\^O^. The explanation was that activated oxygen species produced by Pt^-Al^Oa migrated to the surface of UF4 [7]. Ducarme and Vedrine observed that the oxygen ions of alumina were more labile when situated around Pt crystallites, an observation which may be related to spillover phenomena [8]. The migration of oxygen species has also been proposed by Bond et al. [9] to explain the enhancement of CO oxidation on SnO; due to the presence of Pt. By comparing the effects of Rh, Pt and Pd on the rate of ^O exchange with ^0 of the support (A^t^), Abderrahim and Duprez have been able to establish the kinetic parameters affecting oxygen diffusion on a catalyst surface [10]. Parera et al. have explained the enhancement of the reoxidation of coke deposited on reforming catalysts by the spillover oxygen produced by Pt [11]. Very recently, Baumgarten and Schuck proved that the oxidation of benzoic acid (coke) deposited on alumina can be greatly enhanced by catalysts such as Pt/A^Oa [12], though there was no direct contact between benzoic acid and the catalyst. They explained this enhancement by the migration of activated oxygen from the catalyst to benzoic acid. All these studies deal with oxygen spillover pro- duced by metals. By contrast, some doubts have been expressed with respect to the occurrence of oxygen migration on an oxide surface [13]. Our essential findings concerning the remote control of active sites and the role of spillover oxygen in selective oxidation and oxygen-aided dehydration are based on the case of a few representative mixtures of sepa- rately prepared powders, especially Mo03-a-Sb204 [1, 2] and SnOz-a- 8^04 [14]. In both reactions, a-Sb204 is completely inactive catalytically, but when in contact with other oxides, it considerably enhances the ca- talytic activity of these other oxides. When dealing with spillover phenomenon, it is convenient to distinguish the roles of the two phases, namely the donor D, emitting the spillover species and the acceptor A. In order to prove that an effect is due to the migration of a spillover species from D to A, the first point to verify is that the oxides, D and A, are really separated (i.e. that no mutual contamination takes place between these oxides). The mechanical mixture of Mo03 and a-Sb204 constitutes an excellent system in that respect because extensive characterization rules out the possibility of mutual contamination, as shown in Table 1. One might argue that some intermediate phase forms under the reaction conditions but is separated out upon cooling and/or exposure to air. However in such a case, some changes, in structure and/or texture, should take place for either of the two oxides and/or both of them because of the alternation of formation and decomposition of the mixed species. Post-reaction characterization results do not indicate any such change. Actually, all available evidence shows that the mechanical mixtures are constituted of two separated (non-contaminated) phases. This conclusion is considerably strengthened by results obtained with catalysts prepared by other methods: coprecipitation, solid state reaction 351 TABLE 1 Summary of physico-chemical characterization results for Mo03-a-Sb204 mechanical mixtures in both oxidation of isobutene and oxygen-aided dehydration of N-ethyl for- mamide. Results obtained with samples before and after reaction Methods Results BET 2.0 m2 g~1 for mechanical mixtures and pure oxides [1, 2,15] XRD only the lines characteristic of MoC>3 and a-Sb^C^ are observed for all mechanical mixtures [1, 2,15] AEM only the Mo signal is observed on MoC>3 particles and only the Sb signal on a-Sb204 particles for all samples [2,15] XPS surface composition measured by XPS is proportional to that in bulk [15]; Mo/Sb ratios remain constant after test [2,15] ISS surface composition is the same as that in bulk; Mo/Sb ratios remain cons- tant after test [2,15] and impregnation. In all these cases, a spontaneous decontamination (or segregation) of the samples occurs during catalysis at 400 - 500 C to form two separate oxide phases, Mo03 and a-SbzC^ [2, 15]. Far from exhibiting any tendency to mutual contamination, the oxides have a strong tendency to separate and become decontaminated. The existence of a migration of oxygen was inferred from the catalytic activity results, and thus corresponded only to indirect proof. Other results obtained in Louvain-la-Neuve constitute more direct arguments in favour of a spillover of oxygen. One set of experiments involved Mo03 reduced by Ha. One portion of the reduced sample was mechanically mixed with o;-Sb204. Comparison of the pure and mixed Mo03 samples showed a higher reoxida- tion rate (measured gravimetrically) for the mixed sample [15]: o:-Sb204 favours the incorporation of oxygen into reduced Mo03. In a similar com- parative experiment, coke was deposited on Mo03. Again, the portion of Mo03 mixed with o:-Sb204 reacted more rapidly with oxygen and the re- moval of coke was accelerated [15]. Neither literature nor our results give precise indications concerning the mechanism of surface migration of oxygen. It is known that the mobility of ions at the surface is high. It presumably takes place by jumps between adjacent anion positions, with electrons or holes moving in the boundary 'skin' of the solid, to compensate for the ion charge movement. Mo03 and SnO^ are known to be n-type semiconductors [16, 17]: in that case, elec- trons move in a direction opposite to the surface O2\" or 0~. We did not find data concerning the electronic properties of 0-8^04. A junction, in the electronic sense, forms at the places where the oxides come into contact, allowing electrons or holes to cross the boundary between the oxide phases, while the oxygen ions spill over from one surface to the other. The migrating species is very likely O2\": this is the species identified by surface potential measurements on Bi203, Bi2Mo30i2 and Mo03 at the temperatures corres- ponding to our experiments [18]. 352 In the present work, we attempted to demonstrate still more directly, using labelled oxygen (^O), that oxygen initially contained in a-Sb204 (the donor D) migrated onto M003 (the acceptor A). The experiment was inspired by the success of experiments using ^O for elucidating mechanisms in selective oxidation reactions [19 - 22]. For that purpose, a-Sb204 was labelled with ^O. In order to obtain unequivocal results, it was necessary to avoid the presence of any source of oxygen, in particular gaseous molecular oxygen O;. There is an elegant way to detect \"0 having migrated onto MoC>3. It is known, indeed, that oxygen of the Mo03 lattice can be incorporated in a hydrocarbon radical if no molecular oxygen is present in the gas phase [23]. We thus prepared mix- tures of labelled a-Sb204 with non-labelled Mo03, contacted them with propene and measured the labelled products (acrolein, CO and CO;). The results were compared with those obtained with the isolated oxides (labelled a-Sb204 and non-labelled Mo03). If ^O is incorporated in the products, this constitutes proof of the migration of oxygen from a-Sb204 to Mo03. In addition, we reasoned that a prereduced Mo03 could less easily incorporate its own ^0 into the products, and consequently that the proportion of oxygen coming from a-Sb204 would be larger. We thus performed an exper- iment with a mixture of a-Sb204 and prereduced Mol603. Experimental Catalyst preparation a-Sb204 was obtained by calcination of Sb203 (p.a. Merck) in air at 500 C for 20 h. Mo03 was prepared by calcining (1^4)^07024-4H20 (p.a. Merck) in air at 500 C for 20 h. Two kinds of ^0 containing Sb204 were prepared. The first one was obtained by partial reduction of a-Sb204 at 450 C with pure H2, followed by reoxidation with pure ^0^ (>99%, CEA France) at the same tempera- ture. In this way, a-Sb204 was enriched with ^0 at its surface. We designated it as Sb21804 (I). However, the isotopic labelling of the products obtained with the corresponding catalyst was very low, due to the low overall content in ^0 of a-Sb204. Some 'scrambling' effect [20, 21] possibly further im- paired the results. The second sample was obtained by calcining Sb203 in 1802 at 500 C for 20 h. The sample prepared by this method was desig- nated as Sb21804 (II). The overall ^0 content of Sb21804 (II) was about 25%. But ^0 concentration at the surface was higher. ISS (Ion-Scattering Spec- troscopy) measurements indicated that ^0 surface concentration was about 30% [24]. Another Sb21804 sample, denoted 'not fully oxidized', was prepared by calcining Sb203 in ^O^ at 500 C for 6 h. 'Reduced Mo03' was obtained by the reduction of Mo03 with pure H2 at 450 C for 3 h. 353 The phase identification was done with an X-ray diffraction spectrom- eter (Kristalloflex 805 Siemens). Only the 0-80204 phase was obtained for Sb;1^ (I) and Sb^^ (II). However, we observed traces of Sb^Oy for 'not fully oxidized' Sb;1^. Unless indicated otherwise, the mechanical mixtures were obtained by cogrinding the powders in an agate mortar. Our previous characterization results had shown that this preparation method did not bring about any structural modification and no mutual contamination took place [1, 2,15]. The composition of the mixtures was defined by their mass ratio R^'- Mo03 mass ii^ Mo03 mass + 8^04 mass Henceforth, the mechanical mixtures of Mo03 and Sb21804 will be expressed by the symbols ^M.^ and \"Mx for the first and the second series respectively, where x corresponds to -Rni- For instance, 'Mio is the mixture containing 10% MoOa and 90% Sb;1^ (I). Catalytic oxidation ofpropene The catalytic oxidation of propene was carried out in the absence of gaseous oxygen. The reaction took place in a recirculation reactor (Fig. 1). The reactor was fabricated out of Pyrex tubing with an internal diameter of ca. 2 mm. 600 mg of catalyst was used in each run. Before the experiment, the catalyst was outgassed at 400 C for ca. 30 min. At that time, the pres- sure in the system was usually less than 10~5 torr. Thereafter, about 0.18 mmol propene (60 mbar in the system) was passed over the heated catalyst. to MS I -02 r-\"-, ^ ^ vacuum -=\"T3 0 4?

Recirculation reactor adapted to CyH-s oxidation. The reactant and products were analyzed by an 'on-line' mass spectrom- eter (AEI MS-20) which allowed for the monitoring of the desired masses versus reaction time. In our reaction, acrolein, CO and COa are the observed products. Since no gaseous oxygen was used in the reaction, carbonaceous products (coke) were also deposited on the catalyst. The reaction yield was 354 calculated according to the sum of the MS peaks characteristic of each product with the normalization of the carbon balance, but taking into account only the products detected by MS (without considering coke). A synergy was observed, namely the product yields obtained with the mixtures were higher than the sum of those obtained with quantities of isolated oxides equal to those present in the mixtures. The magnitude of the synergy is expressed as: Y-[RmYlw+^-Rm)Yo] synergy = ^m ^loo4\" (1 ~^m)Yo (1) where Y, Vioc and YQ represent the acrolein yields of the mechanical mix- ture, MoC>3 and Sba^C^ respectively.

Similar figures were obtained for the other samples.

Yields versus reaction time for (a) Mioo (MoC>3) and (b) Mio. Whichever the preparation method, pure Sb^C^ is almost inactive. Pure Mo03 possesses some activity on its own. But its selectivity to acrolein is very poor. It transforms most of the propene to total oxidation products CO and CO^. When the two oxides are mixed mechanically together, how- ever, the catalytic properties are changed dramatically. Both the activity (total conversion) and particularly the selectivity to acrolein are greatly enhanced compared with the simple oxides. There exists a conspicuous synergy between Mo03 and Sb21804 for acrolein formation. 355 TABLE 2 Catalytic activity results for MoOa-Sb^O^ (I) system Sample C; H(, Conv.(%) Yields CO ,(%) C^O CC>2 CO^O C\"02 0^0 CaH^O Acroleinselectivil (%) i Synergyty Sb;\"^ 0.11 0.04 0 0.07 0 0 0 0 'Mio 6.01 1.16 0.04 1.90 0.08 0 2.65 0.18 47.1 27.3 'Mso 7.90 2.67 0.04 1.90 0.04 0 3.21 0.04 41.2 5.6 'MsotR') 8.23 1.60 0.05 2.23 0.07 0 4.07 0.20 51.9 7.5 Mo03 4.97 1.57 0 2.83 0 0 0.57 0 11.5 \"R = reduced Mo03 (reduced with pure H^ at 450 C for 3 h) TABLE 3 Catalytic activity results for MoO^Sb^O^ (II) system Sample CsHo Yield (%) Acrolein Synergy Conv.(%) CO c^o CO; CO^O C^O, CsH40 CaH^O selectivity (%) Sbz*^ 0.13 0.04 0 0.09 0 0 0 0 \"Mio 6.75 1.10 0.09 1.64 0.24 0.01 3.19 0.48 54.4 35.6 \"Mso 6.09 1.06 0.04 1.67 0.09 0 3.18 0.05 53.0 5.5 \"MsotR) 5.66 1.22 0.05 2.11 0.11 0 2.00 0.17 38.3 3.3 MoC>3 4.97 1.57 0 2.83 0 0 0.57 0 11.5 Incorporation of labelled oxygen into oxidation products: migration of oxygen species from Sb^O^ to MoOy As expected, Mo03 produces only ^O products. The mechanical mixtures, however, also produce ^0 products. Part of the oxygen in oxida- tion products comes from Sbz^C^. Since Sb21804 is inactive, the results indicate that the oxygen species of Sb^C^ migrate to the surface of Mo03, the only place where the selective oxidation can take place. The quantity of spillover oxygen produced must increase with the quantity of donor phase Sb21804 and consequently more labelled oxygenated products should be observed. This is indeed concluded when comparing the labelled products formed by Mio and Mgo: Mm produces much more labelled products than M5o, although the total conversions are comparable. For the same composition, more labelled products are produced in the case of Mo03-Sb21804 (II) compared to Mo03-Sb21804 (I). This is logical because of the higher ^0 content of Sb;18^ (II). The comparison between M5o prepared with normal Mo03 and Mso (R) prepared with reduced Mo03 indicates that the latter produces more labelled products (Fig. 3). This is logical for two reasons: (i) lattice oxygen of re- 356 a 0,20 0.15 0.10 0.05 30 60 Reaction time imin.l Fig. 3. Labelled products formation as a function of reaction time. ( ): M5o with reduced MoC>3; (- -): MSO with normal Mo03. duced MoC>3 is less easily incorporated than that of non-reduced Mo03; and (ii) the composition gradient constituting the driving force for the spillover oxygen migration is steeper, hence the diffusion from donor to acceptor should be faster. Conversely, if Mo03 is mixed with a-SbaC^ obtained by calcination of Sb203 in ^Oz at 500 C for only 6 h, no catalytic synergy is observed, because this 'not fully oxidized' Sb^C^ is unable to produce spillover oxygen. Roles of spillover oxygen Our results constitute very direct proof of the migration of oxygen by spillover from 0:^204 to Mo03. The reported results indicate that oxygen from a-Sb204 is incorporated into oxygenated products, thus proving that spillover oxygen reacts with propene adsorbed on Mo03. In our studies in selective oxidation and oxygen-aided dehydration [1, 2,15], we were led to conclude that spillover oxygen also acted by modifying the number and nature of the active centres. Our results here also confirm these views. If spillover oxygen acted only as a reactant, the ^0 proportion in the products would be approximately that in a-Sb204 (namely, 25 - 30% for Sb21804 (II)). But if spillover oxygen exerted a remote control by creating oxidation sites, the incorporation of oxygen from Mo03 would be modified, compared with the case with Mo03 alone. In what follows, we shall analyze in detail the results obtained with the Mo03-Sb21804 (II) mixtures in order to examine this point. Firstly, our previous studies [1-4] have shown that the remote control exerted by Sb204 results essentially in making the other phase (Mo03 or Sn02) more selective and consequently in increasing the selectivity to selective oxidation products (methacrolein in the case of isobutene oxida- 357 tion). In the present case, we observed the same effect: the selectivity to acrolein of the mechanical mixture is about 50%, while that of MoC>3 is only 11.5%. We can make a more precise analysis of the phenomenon. Let us consider the 'excess' yields, namely those obtained thanks to the presence of Sb21804 (II), which correspond to the differences between the real yields of the mechanical mixture and the simple addition of those which would be observed with the quantities of the isolated oxides present in the mixtures. They can be calculated using the following formula: Ay=y-{^yioo+(i--R )yo} (2) where Y, Y^o and YO represent the yields of mechanical mixture, pure MoC>3 and pure Sba^C^ (II), respectively. The calculated 'excess' yields of each oxidation product for the MoC^-Sb^C^ (II) system are reported in Table 4. TABLE 4 Excess yields of each oxidation product calculated with (2) for the MoO^Sbs^t^ (II) system Sample 'Excess' yields (%) CO C^O COi CO^O C^O, C^O C^^O \"Mio 0.94 0.09 1.36 0.24 0.01 3.13 0.48 \"MSO 0.28 0.04 0.26 0.09 0 2.90 0.05 \"MsotR) 0.44 0.05 0.70 0.11 0 1.72 0.17 TABLE 5 The calculated ^O concentrations in 'excess' acrolein, CO^ and CO Sample \"Mio \"Mso M5o(R) A B{%) C(%) 13.3 1.7 9.0 8.1 13.0 6.8 8.7 12.7 10.3 We also define A, B and C as being the concentrations of ^O in 'excess' acrolein, CO^ and CO respectively. They can be easily calculated using the following formulae: A= B= Ay\"c3H,o+ ^YC^'O ^ YCO^'O + 2Aycl8o, 2Ayco, + 2Ayco o + 2Ayc>.o, (3) (4) 358 (5) All calculated A, B and C values (see Table 5) are much lower than 25%, even in the case of \"Mio where more spillover oxygen is available, due to the larger proportion of SbaC^. This indicates that part of the 'excess' yields of the oxidation products is derived from oxygen of MoC>3. This proves that the remote control exerted by a-SbaC^ (emitting spillover oxygen) facilitates the incorporation of Mo03 lattice oxygen into acrolein. This is true even for \"Mgo (R), in spite of the lower reactivity of its lattice oxygen. The incorporation of Mo03 lattice oxygen is the central step in ally lie oxidation. The results presented here imply that spillover oxygen facilitates the incorporation, without itself being incorporated. Our argu- ment is based on the isotopic proportion of oxygen in the 'excess' yields. It would also hold (and seem stronger) if we took the total yields as a basis of our calculation. Our analysis of the results could be further refined. The A, B and C values of Table 5 are comparable for \"Mio, indicating that spillover oxygen serves to form acrolein, COz and CO in almost the same proportion. If we now compare the A values (acrolein). Table 5 shows that they are higher for \"MK) than for \"Mgo; an opposite situation, although less striking, exists for B and C. More spillover oxygen serves to form CO^ and CO than acrolein with \"MSQ. Very little 'excess' acrolein comes from the direct reaction of spillover species with propene with that catalyst. We have shown, in the oxygen-aided dehydration of formamide [15], that one effect of spillover oxygen in remote control was to bum accidental coke deposits. Our present results confirm this action: rather than being used directly as a coreactant with acrolein, spillover oxygen serves principally to burn coke (the relative importance of the two effects will be evaluated below). The effect appears more clearly with the \"Mgo mixture than in \"M^: too much spillover oxygen is present in the latter, blurring the fundamental effect. At the end of this discussion concerning the roles of spillover oxygen, it would be interesting to estimate the relative importance of the two main roles of spillover oxygen: as a reactant and as a message for remote control. Table 6 reports the total 'excess' yield of acrolein AY\" (from Table 4) and the values of 1140 formed from spillover oxygen, as a reactant, assuming an ^0 concentration in spillover species of 25%: AY-Reactant = AVc^.'O/O^ (6) AY, in an approximate way, represents the total increase of acrolein yield due to the synergy of Mo03 and a-Sb;^, and AYaeactant tne contribution of the direct reaction of spillover oxygen to that synergy. The difference (Ay AY'Reactant) corresponds to the remote control effect (AY^c)- The contribution via remote control is comparable to the direct reaction in the case of \"MIQ and is much higher in the case of \"Mgo (ss93%!) (The real contribution of remote control might actually be larger, because we under- 359 TABLE 6 Total excess acrolein and the acrolein from direct reaction and remote control effect Samples Total excess CyH.^0 (AY) % ^Yfteacteat % ^RC% \"Mio \"Mso ^(R) 3.67 1.92 1.75 2.95 0.20 2.75 1.89 0.68 1.21 estimated (25%) the ^O surface concentration on Sb;'^ (II) (30% accor- ding to ISS measurements)). Relevance to normal oxidation conditions The reported data concern experiments carried out in the absence of molecular oxygen. Due to the similarity of the synergistic effects observed in the present experiments and actual catalytic investigations, one can con- clude that the same spillover effects can take place in 'normal' catalysis. The presence of molecular oxygen allows Mo03 to retain a higher degree of oxidation. Maximum synergy is observed for proportions of around 50/50 (Mo03/Sb2C>4) in normal catalysis. The present results show that the remote control part of the overall synergistic effect is greater with M5o than with MIQ, and with M5o (R). This suggests that the magnitude of the effect due to remote control should be still higher in normal selective catalytic oxidations. Conclusions (1) Mo03 and Sb^t^ in the form of a mechanical mixture work synergistically in the oxidation of propene to acrolein in the absence of gaseous oxygen. (2) A migration of oxygen species from Sb21804 to Mo03 does take place. (3) The migration of oxygen species is responsible for the observed synergy between Mo03 and Sb21804. The essential roles of spillover oxygen are (i) as reactant and (ii) as an activating species which could improve the catalytic properties of Mo03 (remote control effect). The latter effect is usually greater than the former. References 1 P. Ruiz, B. Zhou, M. Remy, T. Machej, F. Aoun, B. Doumain and B. Delmon, Cata- lysis Today, 1 (1987)181. 2 L. T. Weng, B. Zhou, B.
