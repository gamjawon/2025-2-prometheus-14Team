Kemnitz*, G. Hansen, A. Hess and A. Kohne Fachbereich Chemie O Humboltli-Universitdt xu Berlin, Hessische Str. 1 /2, 0-1040 Berlin (Germany) (Received January 9, 1992; revised April 23, 1992) Abstract The heterogeneously catalyzed halogen exchange between CC14 and HF yields increasingly higher fluorinated products as a result of consecutive reactions. Rate constants have been determined for all reaction steps. Using these constants, conversion versus time curves under different reaction conditions have been calculated. The 'selectivities' of heterogeneous catalysts are discussed with regard to practical conclusions. The following values of Arrhenius activation energies that are specific for the catalyst have been determined: CC14 ~ CC13F EA =73.1 kJ mol-' CC13FHO CC12F2 EA=38.3 kJ mol-' CC12F2 ~ CCIF3 EA =14.3 kJ mol' Introduction Fluorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons will be used as starting materials for production of fluoropolymers and fluorinated pharmaceutical products in the future. They are usually obtained by halogen exchange of the corresponding chlorohydrocarbon with hydrogen fluoride. If the chlorohydrocarbon molecule contains more than one chlorine atom, then the halogen exchange occurs via competitive, consecutive reactions. In nearly all cases the kinetic inhibition requires the use of a catalyst to accelerate the reaction rate in order to achieve good yields. However, since the values of the activation energies of different steps in the consecutive reaction are comparable, selective heterogeneous catalysts for certain reaction steps are not yet known. This seems to be obvious, because only a slight variation of the physical and physicochemical properties - accompanied by a small steric alteration of the organic molecule - occurs owing to the stepwise exchange between fluorine and chlorine on the carbon atom [1 ]. Nevertheless, in many cases a heterogeneous *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 194 catalyst for such a consecutive reaction is called a `selective catalyst' if a high yield of one fluorinated product is obtained. Often this so-called selectivity is caused not only by the differences between the rate constants of the single reaction steps, but also by the fact that, depending on the adjusted reaction parameters (time, temperature etc.), maximum yields of individual consecutive products can be obtained even when the rate constants are comparable. In the latter case the reaction parameters, not the catalyst, should be called `selective'. Maximum yields of desired products can be obtained either by varying the reaction parameters empirically or by calculating them accurately with the help of the previously determined rate constants. The kinetics of heterogeneously catalyzed halogen exchange reactions has been investigated for only a few reaction systems [2-4]. Vecchio et al. [2] studied the kinetics of the catalyzed fluorine-chlorine exchange for hexachloroethane. However, the authors determined only the conversion versus time curves and draw only qualitative conclusions concerning the kinetics. More extensive studies were made on the same reaction system by Marangoni et al. [3, 4], but mathematic modelling of the consecutive reactions based on these results is also impossible. The present study is aimed at improving our understanding of the mechanism of such reactions by means of kinetic investigations and derived results. The reaction of CC14 with HF was chosen as a model system. It is possible that the results could be applied to CZ- and C3-systems, which are more difficult to characterize (e.g., owing to formation of isomers). The following symbols are used in the text: EA Arrhenius activation energy dp /dt reaction rate ks rate constants Experimental The kinetic measurements were carried out in a flow reactor. The final step of the reaction (eqn. (1)) was studied first. Then the preceding partial reactions were analysed step by step using the previously determined rate constants. Owing to the appropriate choice of the reaction conditions (low temperature, short contact time), the last partial reaction of CC13F to CF4 was not catalyzed by CrF3. Hence, this thermodynamically possible but kinetically inhibited last partial reaction was not taken into account. The determination of the reaction time, which is equivalent to the residence time of the gas in the catalyst bed, was carried out by subdividing the free gas volume in the catalyst zone by the volumetric flow rate. The catalyst, CrF3, was prepared by thermal decomposition of (NH4)3CrFg (analytical grade). The finely powdered CrF3 was pressed into pellets, and then crushed, and a fraction with a 315-500 pm grain size and 10 m2 g- I specific surface was obtained. 195 The conversion of the gaseous initial and final products was analyzed using gas chromatography (Porapak Q column) after alkaline absorption of HCl and HF. The gas composition was determined with the help of calibrations. Deviations did not exceed t 3g'o. All kinetic measurements were carried out under conditions in which gas and pore diffusion are not rate-determining. Care was taken to work in the Henry region of the adsorption isotherm. Results In eqn. (1), each partial reaction is thermodynamically possible (see Table 1). +HF +HF +HF +HF ca, - ---HCI > CC13F -HCl ~ CC12F2 - HCI ) CCIF3 -HCl ) CF4 (1) Hence, from the thermodynamic point of view an excess of HF in the system should lead to the formation of perfluorinated product, almost exclusively. However, this was not observed in our experiments. The kinetic investigation of reactions (1) should provide kinetic data specific to the catalyst. These data can be used to calculate the composition of the product mixture, which depends on the reaction parameters. Mathematical analysis of the measurements was performed with the help of specially developed computer programs [5] that facilitated the numerical integration of the differential rate equations. The kinetic model is based on the successively occurring partial reactions of eqn. (1): CC14 +HFkI ~ CC13F+HCl (la) CC13F +HF k?, ~ CC12F2 +HCl (lb) CC12F2 + HF k3 ) CCIF3 + HCl (1 c) CCIF3 + HF k4 ) CF4 + HCl (1 d) The last step (ld) was not observed.

Since mixtures with a mole ratio CC14 _nFn:HF of 1:1 (at normal pressure) were used, the partial pressure of the organic starting substance is 50.65 kPa at t = 0. From the difference between the time-dependent decrease in the partial pressures of the organic starting material and that of HF (the latter decreases more rapidly owing to possible competitive reactions), the k value of the initial reaction as well as those of the subsequent reaction steps can be calculated with the help of a modified computer program. This procedure has been described previously [5]. The rate constants derived from these curves can be represented by an Arrhenius plot (see Fig. 2). The difference between the rate constants kl and k2 compared with k3 becomes significant at higher temperatures. Discussion In order to improve our understanding of the mechanistic processes of these heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, we have attempted to distinguish between the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and the Rideal-Eley mechanism [6]. However, in the present case a definite assignment is not possible. Our results suggest that a modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism occurs: The reactants, HIP and halomethane, exhibit quite different chemical behaviours and enter at different places on the catalyst surface area. Moreover, competitive adsorption was not observed in our experiments. Definite conclusions about lsa this problem can be drawn from the results of adsorption measurements, which we will report very soon. The distinction between the two different adsorption mechanisms is of secondary importance at low partial pressures. In both cases a second-order rate equation results [ 5 ]. It is possible to calculate partial pressure vs. residence time curves, with varying temperature and dosing ratio of starting substances, using the Arrhenius activation energies and the experimentally determined rate constants. The mathematical modeling is based on eqns. (I)-(IV). Figure 3 shows the curves calculated for the consecutive reactions (eqns. (l a)-(l c)) at various temperatures (dosing ratio CC14:HF=1:1). According to Fig. 3 (T=523 K), a stationary state will be attained at an organic product composition of about 50% CC13F, 20% CC12F2 and traces of CCIF3 (sum of organic reactants = 50.65 kPa =100ss'o).

The `selectivity' for CC13F improves with increasing temperature. 80% CC13F with traces of CC12F2 is obtained at 823 K after 2 s. After about 12 s HF is nearly completely converted, whereas the conversion of CC14 is about 90% and the product ratio CC13F:CC12F2 is 80:10. From these results it can be concluded that CrF3 catalyzes the formation of CC13F under the conditions described. It must be emphasized that owing to the CC14:HF dosing ratio of 1:1, further consecutive reactions are not possible, because of the complete conversion of HF. Upon changing the CC14:HF dosing ratio to 1:4, quite different behaviour of the system is observed (same catalyst; see Fig. 4). According to Fig. 4 (T= 523 K) the catalyst has lost its `selectivity', i.e., a mixture of CC13F, CC1zF2 and CCIF3 is obtained. Only a small amount of CC14 is converted. However, at higher temperatures the reaction attains a large concentration maximum of CC13F caused by increasing k values within a very short reaction 25partiai pressure (kPal 523 K 20 15r I .0 b d i - a 0 0 50 100 150 time [s] lartlal pressure [kPal 723 K 25 20 5 5 0 5 10 time [sl c b 15 20 25i 20 15 tpl 5~ 25partiai pressure [kPal 623 K 20 15 i ,p i5 0 b 200 0 50 100 time [sl 150 200 ~artial pressure [kPa] 823 K _ d ~ d 0 0 5 10 15 20 time [sJ Fig. 4.

The excess of HF over CC14 is the reason that further consecutive reactions can now proceed. The maximum yield of CC13F is reached at a residence time of about 1 s (see Fig. 4, T= 823 K). Under these particular reaction conditions CrF3 is a `selective' catalyst for the formation of CC13F. However, it can be seen that even very small deviations from this residence time affect the .product composition dramatically. For instance, the opposite product composition is obtained after 10-15 s. In this case the formation of CC12F2 is catalyzed `selectively'. From these studies direct evidence is obtained that competitive halogenexchange reactions can be controlled using the kinetic data specific for the catalyst in order to obtain high yields of a certain product. The curves calculated by the computer program corresponding to eqns. (I)-(IV) are in good agreement with experimentally determined compositions. Deviations do not exceed 10%.
