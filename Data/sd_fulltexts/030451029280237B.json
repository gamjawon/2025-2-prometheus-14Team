Bijsterbosch*, Freek Kapte~jn and Jacob A. Moulijn Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (Netherlands) Abstract CO adsorption and CO oxidation by OZ were studied over alumina-supported copper and copper-chromium oxide from 300 to 673 K. After evacuation at room temperature, Cu'-CO and carbonate-like complexes were observed on copper-containing catalysts upon CO adsorption. Both the copper and the chromium oxide species were easier to reduce on Cu0*Cr203/A1203 compared with Cu0/A1203 and Cr203/A1203 owing to the presence of a mixed oxidic phase. CO can react directly from the gas phase with oxygen at the surface under formation of a COZ surface species as a reaction intermediate. This indicates an Eley-Rideal mechanism. COz adsorption results in bands similar to those observed upon CO and upon CO and OZ admission. COZ inhibits the CO oxidation reaction in two ways - via the more weakly, reversibly bound COZ and via the more strongly, irreversibly held carbonates. Introduction Air pollution is a major environmental problem. It is mainly due to carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NO,), and sulphur oxides (SO,) originating from industrial plants, power plants, and automobiles. These substances directly contribute to photochemical smog and acid rain. In populated areas, the large number of automobiles is the major source of emissions of HC, CO, and NO,. Concern for the danger to public health and the environment has led to emissions regulations in Western countries in recent years [ I ]. One method for reducing automotive emissions is cleaning the exhaust gases by means of a three-way catalyst (TWC), which converts HC,. CO, and NO, into H20, COz and N2. The commercially available TWC is based on platinum, rhodium, and palladium. Research for more available and cheaper materials has been re-evaluated in recent years, and supported copper-chromium oxides (Cu0*Cr203) appeared to be good catalysts for CO oxidation and NO reduction [ 2-4 ]. The mechanisms of both reactions over the Cu0*Cr203 catalyst are still unknown. Therefore, an in situ Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic study concerning the interaction of CO and NO with copper-containing catalysts has been undertaken [5]. In *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 194 this paper the oxidation of CO over CUO/A1203 and CuO*Cr203/A1203 is reported. The oxidation of CO over copper oxide has been studied since 1923 [6]. Although the reaction looks very simple, 2 CO +02-2 CO2, the reaction mechanism is still not clearly established. In particular, the question whether gaseous or adsorbed CO reacts with adsorbed oxygen atoms on the catalyst surface has recently been brought under discussion again. Prokopowicz et al. [7] observed a first-order dependence on CO and a zero-order dependence on OZ (above 4% OZ) on silica-supported cupric oxide. They proposed an Eley-Rideal mechanism between gaseous CO and adsorbed oxygen atoms [7]. Choi and Vannice [8], on the other hand, studied CO oxidation over pre-reduced alumina-supported copper and proposed a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism based on the observation that no activity was measured in the absence of adsorbed CO [8]. In this FT-IR study oxidized CuO*Cr2O3/A1203 is studied under CO oxidation reaction conditions in order to obtain information about the adsorption sites and intermediates, which will be used to elucidate the mechanism of CO oxidation over this catalyst. Experimental Sample preparation Three 10 wt.% (based on metals) catalysts have been studied in their oxidized state: Cu0/A1203, Cr203/A1203, and CuO*Cr2O3/A1203 (with a molar Cu/Cr ratio of 1). The catalysts were prepared by pore volume impregnation of Ketjen 000-1.5 E T-A1203 with solutions of copper and/or chromium nitrates (Merck p.a.) followed by drying and calcining. The Cu0*Cr203 catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation. Drying was performed in air, by gradually increasing the temperature from 298 to 353 K over a period of 5 h, followed by an isothermal period of one night at 353 K. The samples were finally dried at 383 K in a flow of air for 1 h. Dried samples were calcined in air at a heating rate of 5 K min-' to 773 K and were kept at this temperature for 1 h. After calcination the catalyst was ground in a mortar, and 10 mg of the powder was pressed into a thin self-supporting disk of 10 mm diameter. The disk was placed into a stainless-steel holder, which was used directly in the infrared cell. Before each infrared experiment, the samples were subjected to an in situ pretreatment to remove H20, CO2, and organic contaminants, by heating in 20 or 200 mbar 02 up to 673 K at a heating rate of 3 K min-'. At 673 K the cell was evacuated for 15 min and subsequently cooled in the same amount of OZ to room temperature (RT) to prevent reduction of the oxide. After evacuation at RT a clean, oxidized sample was obtained, as was confirmed by IR. More reduced samples were obtained by heating them at 3 K min-' in 20 mbar CO up to 573 K for Cu0/A1203 and Cu0*Cr2O3/A12O3 and in 100 mbar CO up to 673 K for Cr203/A1203. The heating rate in the adsorption and reaction experiments is 3 K min-' [5]. 195 Equipment A detailed description of the in situ transmission infrared cell, in which the catalyst samples were studied, is given elsewhere [9]. The cell is equipped with a quartz body and CaF2 windows. A small external heating element is used to heat the sample. At each end of the quartz tube the cell has two stainless-steel holders in which the windows axe mounted. Two Viton Orings are used on each end of the cell as a seal between the body, the stainless-steel holder, and the window. The space between the two rings is evacuated with a rotary pump. This differential pumping configuration is less sensitive to possible leakage, and a better vacuum is reached. The temperature is measured with a thermocouple at the sample surface, which is used for temperature control of the cell. The cell is connected to a 50 1 s-' turbomolecular pump and a gas inlet system, which allow either static or flow experiments. With this configuration pressures well below 10-' mbar can be achieved [5, 9]. Spectra were recorded with a Nicolet MX10 Fourier transform spectrometer. 320 scans were added to obtain a spectrum with a resolution of 2 cm-' over the total spectral range (3800-1100 cm-'). Results When CO is adsorbed on alumina-supported catalysts, changes are usually observed in three spectral regions, namely, in the hydroxyl stretching region (3690-3800 cm-'), the carbonylic region (2000-2300 cm-'), and the carbonate stretching region (1100-1800 cm-'). The strong absorption observed below 1100 cm-' is due to AI-O and Al-OH stretching modes of the support. Changes in the OH stretching region are difficult to interpret owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio in that region. Cu0/At2 03 After 20 mbar CO adsorption on pre-oxidized Cu0/A1203 at 300 K, the most intense band is found at 2123 cm-' and is assigned to CO stabilized on reduced Cu' surface sites (Cu'-CO) [10-12], as shown in Fig. la. It increases slightly with time, indicating that the catalyst surface is being partially reduced by CO at 300 K. The wing of gaseous CO is seen at around 2180 cm-'. Gaseous CO can easily be removed by evacuation at 300 K, while the main absorption band at 2123 cm-' still has considerable intensity. Below 1700 cm-' broad bands at 1230, 1440 and 1650 cm-' are observed, which most probably represent a bidentate (1230 and 1650 cm-') and a noncoordinated (1440 cm-') carbonate [10, 13]. The formation of bicarbonates cannot be excluded. The intensities of the carbonate bands increase slightly with time. As shown in Figs. lb and lc, upon heating at 3 K min-' the Cu' -CO band becomes more intense up to 473 K, indicating a surface reduction. Between 473 and 5 73 K the transmission of the sample diminishes considerably, 196 U C co O .92 2345 (e)' (d J (b) I (a) 2450 2360 2270 2180 2090 2000 2123 1520 1395 1230 (d) j (b) 1800 1700 1600 1500 1400 1300 1200 frequency/cm-' Fig. 1.

At 673 K the Cu' -CO band has disappeared. The carbonate-like bands do not increase while heating, but above 423 K, two extra bands at 1395 and 1530 cm-1 can be distinguished, while the bands at 1230 and 1650 cm-1 diminish. The band at 1440 cm-' can still be observed at 423 K, but it convolutes with the band at 1395 cm-1 to one broad band at around 1420 cm-1. The new bands probably represent monodentate carbonate species[ 10, 13 ]. The monodentate carbonate can originate from the transformation of bidentate carbonate, from (re)adsorbed CO2, or from an intermediate in the reaction. 197 Upon COz adsorption (Fig. ld) on oxidized Cu0/A1203, besides an intense band at around 2345 cm-', the same carbonate bands (at 1235, 1475 and 1650 cm-') are observed. They start to change shape at a somewhat higher temperature (473 K), and at 573 K the transformation to two broad bands at around 1395 and 1520 cm-' is complete (Fig. le). Evacuation at 623 K after a CO adsorption experiment, followed by CO adsorption at RT, yields the same spectrum, only the Cu' carbonyl absorption is three times stronger. Apparently evacuation, even at 298 K, induces the removal of some labile surface oxygen, creating coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Cu' centres [141. Upon co-adsorbing CO and 02 (2:1) at 300 K, a band due to Cu'-CO is observed, which increases slightly with time. The intensity of this band at 2123 cm-' in the presence of OZ is identical to that in the absence of 02, It is maximal between 323 and 373 K and has disappeared at 573 K, while the band of weakly adsorbed COZ (ca. 2345 cm-') develops. This increase in this band is taken as a measure of the advancement of the reaction, since its absorbance intensity is proportional to the CO2 pressure. Gaseous CO is not observed. The carbonate bands at around 1230 and 1660 cm-' have disappeared at 473 K, while bands at 1390 and 1590 cm-' appear. The band at 1435 cm-' diminishes above 473 K. Adsorbing 30 mbar CO and Oz (2:1) at RT on a more reduced catalyst, the band at 2123 cm-' is more intense. At 573 K it has disappeared and the transmission has increased, indicating that the catalyst has become more oxidized again. Admitting CO and 02 (2:1) to the copper catalyst, which is held at 473 K, resulted in COZ (2340 cm-'), Cu'-CO (2124 cm-'), monodentate carbonate (1390 and 1540 cm-', strong), bidentate carbonate (1230 and 1640 cm-', weak), and noncoordinated carbonate (1435 cm-', weak). On a catalyst pre-reduced with CO at 300 K all bands, except those of bidentate carbonate, are observed. In summary, CO adsorption is a reversible process. At room temperature CO adsorbs on Cu+. The absorption band is increasing with time on a preoxidized sample and the formed interaction is stable up to 623-673 K. CO adsorption on Cu2+ is not observed, since Cue+-CO is stable only at 77 K [ 10, 11 ]. Upon CO and CO2 adsorption bidentate and noncoordinated carbonates or bicarbonates are formed at 300 K, while monodentate carbonates are observed at higher temperatures. In the presence of 02, the Cu+-CO species and the bidentate carbonate group are less stable than in the absence of 02, owing to CO oxidation: between 373 and 573 K the bands, which represent Cu+-CO and bidentate, a possible intermediate, decrease, whereas the COZ band at 2345 cm-', indicating the reaction progress, increases. Cr2 03 /ALZ 03 When CO is adsorbed on oxidized Cr203/AI203 at RT, only the gas-phase spectrum of CO is seen (Fig. 2a). Upon heating at 473 K, as shown in Fig. 2b, weak monodentate carbonate bands (at ca. 1325 and 1550 cm-') and a band around 2200 cm-' are observed, and this latter band has disappeared 198 at 673 K. This band is assigned to CO adsorption on cus Cr3+ atoms [15-171. Apparently, surface oxygen has to be removed before CO adsorption can take place. The carbonate bands become very intense at 573 K (Mg. 2c), much more intense than on Cu0/A1203. At 673 K the carbonates are still present, but disappear after evacuation at 623 K. Adsorption of CO at RT on a catalyst reduced with CO at 673 K results directly in an intense band at 2200 cm-1 (FIg. 2d), which decreases when the temperature is raised. At 473 K, the band at 2200 cm-1 has decreased about 60% and has the same intensity as on the oxidized sample at 473 K. At 673 K the carbonyl 1550 1325 2200 k 2500 2300 2100 1900 1700 1500 1300 1100 frequency/cm-' 1545 1360 O h N (8I 2500 2300 2100 1900 1700 1500 1300 1100 frequency/cm-' Fig. 2.

Fig. 3.

The bidentate carbonate band at 1230 cm-' appears upon CO adsorption on the reduced catalyst and disappears at 673 K. The v(C=O) vibration around 1650 cm-' which should accompany this band, has probably disappeared under the 1550 cm-' band. In both experiments the CO2 band at 2345 cm-' increases slightly with increasing temperature above 473 K. In summary, CO adsorption does not occur on pre-oxidized Cr203/A1203 at room temperature, but rather on a slightly reduced catalyst. Monodentate carbonate species develop in considerable amounts at the surface with increasing temperature, especially above 573 K, much more than at the surface of Cu0/A1203. Cu0* Crz O3 /ALZ 03 Adsorption of 20 mbar CO at room temperature on a pre-oxidized sample directly shows two bands: an intense one at 2142 cm-' (Cu'-CO) and a weak one at 2199 cm-' (Cr3+-CO). After 90 min the intensity of both bands is doubled and the frequencies have shifted (from 2142 to 2134 and from 2199 to 2191 cm-'), so the catalyst is being reduced slightly (Fig. 3a). The two monodentate carbonate bands at ca. 1360 and 1545 cm-', which look like those seen on Cr203/A1203, also develop over time. Upon evacuation at 300 K the band at 2191 cm-' disappears immediately, while the band at 2134 cm-' decreases quickly initially, followed by a slower decay. After one night of evacuating, the intensity of the Cu'-CO band is still 30% of the pre-evacuation intensity. The carbonate bands are not affected by evacuation. After re-adsorbing CO or adsorbing CO on a sample pre-reduced with CO, a spectrum similar to Fig. 3a is observed at 300 K: the process of CO adsorption is reversible. The intensities of the carbonyl bands are comparable to those on an oxidized sample. As shown in Fig. 3b, all bands increase upon heating at 3 K min-' to 373 K. The band at 2192 cm-' has disappeared at 473 K (Fig. 3c). The Cu' -CO band is more intense, but decreases at 573 K, as can be seen in Fig. 3d. It shifts to 2121 cm-' and is still present at 673 K. This Cu' -CO bond is more thermostable than the corresponding bond on Cu0/A1203. The monodentate carbonate bands (at ca. 1350 and 1550 cm-') have maximum intensity around 473 K. They do not change shape. The weak band at 1230 cm-', indicating the presence of bidentate carbonates, is present up to 523 K. Upon co-adsorbing CO and 02, the same trend as in CO adsorption is observed: a band at 2142 cm-', which increases with time, and a weak band at 2192 cm-', which disappears by evacuating at RT. The carbonate bands are much more intense than the bands on Cu0/A1203 in a similar experiment. The already present weak carbonate bands at 1365 and 1540 cm-' increase with time and with temperature up to 673 K. CO and 02 co-adsorption on a reduced catalyst shows more intense bands at 2131 and 2192 cm-'. The band at 2192 cm-' has disappeared at 423 K, while the main band diminishes slowly and shifts to 2123 cm-'. 200 At the same time the carbonate (at ca. 1365 and 1540 cm-') and C02 (2348 cm-' ) bands are increasing. The adsorption of CO in the presence of OZ resulted in bands frequencies similar to those observed upon CO adsorption in the absence of 02. The intensities of the bands and the thermostability of the Cu'-CO complex are somewhat lower in the presence of 02. From a kinetics study of this catalyst [ 18 ], it was found that C02 strongly inhibits the CO oxidation reaction and that the reaction was zero order in OZ and nearly first order in CO. In order to combine these results with IR data, the following additional experiments were performed. At RT or 573 K, 50 mbar C02 was admitted to the oxidized sample in the absence and in the presence of (50 mbar) 02, followed by admission of 50 mbar CO at that temperature. C02 adsorption at RT on an oxidized catalyst shows the previously seen bands at 2340, 1230, 1465 and 1650 cm-'. As for the Cu0/A1203 catalyst the absorption intensity at around 2340 cm-' turned out to be proportional to the C02 pressure. Upon additional admission of CO at RT only the spectrum of gaseous CO is observed during the first minutes, while the C02 band at 2340 cm-' increases. After 15 min a small band at 2131 cm-' (Cu'-CO) is observed. Upon heating up to 373 K, the carbonyl band as well as those of the carbonates have increased, while the C02 band has decreased slightly. At 473 K, the carbonate bands have increased considerably; there are two strong monodentate carbonate bands at 1365 and 1535 cm-', a strong noncoordinated carbonate band at 1420 cm-', and two weaker bidentate carbonate bands at 1225 and 1610 cm-'. In addition to the carbonates the carbonyl and C02 bands have also increased. At 573 K the carbonyl band has nearly disappeared. Performing a similar experiment at 573 K, the same trend is observed. Upon CO admittance, only gaseous CO is observed, together with an increase in the intensity of the C02 band at 2340 cm-' during the first minutes. After 15 and 30 min Cu'-CO is observed at 2121 cm', while the C02 band decreases slightly, whereas the monodentate carbonate bands at 1395 and 1540 cm-' have increased. Admission of 50 mbar C02 together with 50 mbar 02 at RT shows the typical C02 adsorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4a. When CO is added, only gaseous CO is observed during the first minutes, together with a large increase in the C02 band intensity (Mg. 4b). After 15 min, the carbonylic absorption can be perceived (Mg. 4c), while the C02 band has decreased by 20ss'o. The carbonate bands have increased slightly. Upon heating, at 373 K, the carbonate bands start to change shape, and the C02 band has decreased slightly, whereas the carbonyl band has increased slightly (Mg. 4d). In Fig. 4e, at 473 K, two monodentate carbonate bands can be distinguished, as well as a smaller carbonyl band, and a very intense C02 band at 2340 cm-'. At 573 K (Fig. 4f), the carbonate bands have diminished, the carbonyl band has disappeared, and the intensity of the C02 band is unchanged. Performing a similar experiment starting at 573 K gives the results shown in Fig. 4g.

After 15 min the carbonate bands at 1395 and 1540 cm-1 have increased, and the band at 2340 cm-1 has increased considerably. In this experiment, only gaseous CO, and no carbonyls, have been observed, even after prolonged periods. Discussion CO adsorption on oxidized copper and copper-chromium alumina-supported catalysts results in bands in the carbonyl and carbonate region in agreement with those described in the literature [10-12]: a Cu'-CO band at 2123-2142 cm-1 and three types of carbonate bands, namely, bidentate carbonate at around 1230 and 1650 cm-1, noncoordinated carbonate at around 1440 cm-1, and monodentate carbonate at around 1395 and 1550 cm-1. Some groups have observed two carbonyl bands upon CO adsorption on CuO, at 2120 and 2140 cm-1, indicating two states of Cu' (square planar and tetragonal pyramidal) [ 10-12 ]. They concluded that the band at 2140 cm-1 is characteristic of less reduced areas, where the electron availability is poor, whereas the other one is characteristic of more reduced areas, where the electron availability is larger. On both pre-oxidized and pre-reduced Cu0/ A1203 only one band was observed in the carbonyl region at around 2130 cm-1 on CO adsorption [10]. It is assigned to CO stabilized on reduced surface sites, Cu + ions in a state close to Cu0 [ 10-12 ]. From our experiments, we cannot exclude the existence of two Cu'-CO bands, since the observed band is rather broad, ranging from 2080 to 2155 cm-1. It could be a convolution of two bands, whose intensity changes with degree of reduction, explaining the observed shift. Carbonate-like bands are observed on all catalysts. The intense and more thermostable monodentate carbonate bands on Cr203/Alz03 (compared with those on Cu0/A1203) could be responsible for the low activity of the chromium catalyst compared with the copper catalyst in CO oxidation. The reaction mechanism over chromium oxide catalysts is thought to proceed via a carbonate intermediate [10]. These thermostable carbonates prevent the reaction at lower temperatures. The copper-chromium oxide catalyst shows intense carbonyl bands upon CO adsorption. The Cu'-CO band is much more intense than the one on Cu0/A1203, and the Cr3+-CO band is already observed at RT on the oxidized catalyst. Obviously, the mixed oxide catalyst contains more loosely bound oxygen at the surface, which can be removed more easily by evacuation at RT [ 10, 14 ]. This may indicate a higher dispersion of the Cu0*Crz03 catalyst compared with the CuO and Cr203 catalyst due to the presence of a mixed oxidic phase. The observed frequency shifts of 10 cm-1 for the carbonyl bands are an indication that there exist electronic interactions between Cu0 203 and Cr203 in a mixed oxidic phase. The shift of the Cu' -CO band to lower wavenumbers during the experiment can be explained by a higher extent of reduction. The CO oxidation is considered to proceed via a redox mechanism of the copper phase for both the copper oxide and the copper-chromium oxide catalyst [18]. The role of chromium in the Cu0*Cr203 catalyst is not fully clear. From a kinetics study [ 18 ], it is concluded that the reaction over Cu0*Cr203/A12O3 is zero order in 02 and nearly first order in CO, as is found in the literature for various copper-containing catalysts [ 7, 8 ]. OZ adsorbs dissociatively, and the surface is always covered with oxygen atoms to a certain extent. The inhibiting effect of COz is ascribed to adsorption on reduced and oxidized active sites, and therefore COz competes with CO for these sites. The selected best model in the kinetics study is based on an Eley-Rideal mechanism, in which gaseous CO reacts with adsorbed oxygen to form an adsorbed COz intermediate. The latter COZ intermediate desorbs at a rate comparable to that of the reaction of CO with the oxidized site. So, both reactions influence the overall reaction rate [ 18 ]. In this IR study, concerning co-adsorption of CO and 02, the increase in the intensity of the C02 band at around 2340 cm-' is used as a qualitative measure of the extent of the reaction. The same types of carbonates are formed upon CO and upon COz adsorption. Bidentate and noncoordinated carbonates are observed at low temperatures, whereas at high temperatures monodentate and probably noncoordinated carbonates are seen. These results indicate that COZ adsorption yields surface complexes similar to those resulting from the interaction of CO with the surface. The IR results of the CO oxidation experiments with pre-adsorbed C02 in the presence and absence of 02 indicate that adsorbed CO2 can be formed by a direct interaction of CO and the oxidized catalyst, without an observable formation of the Cu+-CO complex. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the absorption coefficient of the carbonyl is larger than that of the COZ band around 2345 cm-' [10, 14]. This suggests that the reaction proceeds via an Eley-Rideal mechanism. It is striking that directly after CO introduction the COz band around 2345 cm-' increases considerably, and decreases subsequently by 20% after 15 min (Fig. 4b and 4c). Based on this result, combined with the kinetics analysis [ 18 ], it is speculated that this COz complex is an intermediate formed by interaction of CO with the oxidic surface, followed by a somewhat slower desorption. After a certain period, an equilibrium with the gas-phase C02 is established. Otherwise this intensity maximum of the band at 2345 cm-' as a function of time cannot be accounted for. Being an intermediate, the desorption of COz results in Cu' sites at which CO can adsorb, as observed. However, in the presence of Oz these sites are also quickly re-oxidized, explaining the low amount of Cu'-CO complexes and the zero reaction order in 02- In the absence of OZ the Cu'-CO complex is formed in much larger amounts. The carbonate complexes are formed at the catalyst surface by interaction with COz as well as with CO. In the latter case it cannot be determined 204 whether CO reacts directly with the surface under formation of carbonate species or whether it involves a desorption and re-adsorption of CO2. Since the carbonates occupy surface sites, this will lower the catalytic activity, as concluded from the kinetics results [18]. Thus it appears that COZ can inhibit the CO oxidation reaction by adsorption on two types of sites, namely the sites that can adsorb COZ strongly (carbonate-like species) and the sites that can adsorb weakly (physisorbed species), as Jackson [ 19 ] and our kinetics study suggested [ 18 ]. The IR results indicate that both intermediates are present at elevated temperatures, the carbonate species in a lower amount than the COZ complex. This is in good agreement with the calculation based on the kinetics parameters. Conclusions In order to elucidate the mechanism of the CO oxidation reaction over CuO*CrZO3/A1203 an IR study was performed, which has given information about adsorption sites and intermediates in the CO oxidation reaction. On the copper-containing catalysts CO adsorption on Cu' is observed after evacuation at RT. On Cu0*Cr203 both the copper and the chromium oxide are easier to reduce owing to the presence of a mixed oxidic phase, which may result in a higher dispersion. 02 is able to re-oxidize these Cu' sites. If the catalyst is in its oxidized state, the CO and OZ reaction proceeds via an Eley-Rideal mechanism, in which CO reacts from the gas phase with weakly bound oxygen and forms a C02 surface species, which is tentatively proposed as a reaction intermediate. Interaction of CO and of COz with the catalyst also leads to more strongly bound carbonate-like intermediates. Both types of surface species influence the reaction rate and account for the inhibition by C02- References 1 K. C. Taylor, in A. Crucq and A.
