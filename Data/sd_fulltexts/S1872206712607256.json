He has long been engaged in the teaching of physical chemistry and research on heterogeneous catalysis, and the physical chemistry textbooks he wrote with Professor Xiancai Fu has had far-reaching influences on many generations of chemists. He has made many new research findings on the interactions between the constituent components on oxide catalysts and nanoscaled non-crystalline alloy catalysts and in many areas of mesoscopic chemistry. He has published over 400 papers, been granted 26 Chinese and 7 international patents, and been honored with 5 national and provincial academic awards. In 1996, he received the Excellent Academic Leader Award of Jiangsu Province, and his research group received the Excellent Chemistry Group Award of Jiangsu Province. In 1997, he was honored with the National Excellent Scientific and Technological Researcher Award. In 2005, he was elected academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Professor Yi Chen worked mainly on heterogeneous catalysis in his academic career and achieved notable success. In addition to his teaching and research, he has been very active in promoting the development of catalysis research in China. In the early 1980s, together with Professors Qirui Cai, Shaoyi Peng, Enze Min, and Xiexian Guo, he sat on the national Chinese Catalysis Committee, which was responsible for the organization of catalytic research in China to meet national needs and economic development. He has made many contributions to advance the Chinese catalysis community, including helping to increase international academic exchanges. He was one of the initiators of many international academic conferences, e.g., the First Sino-Japan-USA Conference on Catalysis (1982), which later became the series of International Conference on Catalysis in the Asian-Pacific region. In 2004, on behalf of Chinese Catalysis Committee, he presented the Chinese bid to hold the International Conference on Catalysis in China to the Council of International Association of Catalysis Societies. In 2008, he served as Chairman of the 14th National Conference on Catalysis in China. He has made many definitive contributions in the organization of key research fields to meet national needs, and in the setting up of and development of the 8th and 9th Five Year Initiative (Pangdeng) Projects and National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program). As a member of the academic committees of several key laboratories that work on catalysis, he has devoted much effort to their research planning and academic development. In recent years, he led the long-term collaboration between Nanjing University and SINOPEC and the establishing and development of the Key Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry of the Ministry of Education, which has catalysis as its main research area. Professor Yi Chen has held many important posts for the development of academic and social communities, e.g., he is a member of the Examining Committee of the Chinese University Development Projects of the World Bank (1982), Committee for the 15-Year Development Plan of Science and Technology in China of the Ministry of Education of China (1983), and Textbook Editorial Committee of Science Departments in Chinese Universities and Colleges, and he has served as Vice Director of the Development Group for Chemistry Curriculum Structuring (1984–1988), Chairman of Chinese Catalysis Committee (1988–1990), Chinese national representative at the International Association of Catalysis Societies (1988–1996), President of Chinese Chemical Society (1994–1998), Director of the Steering Committee for Chemistry Teaching in Chinese Universities and Colleges (1995–2000), member of Science and Technology Committee of the Ministry of Education of China (1990–2000), editorial board member of Journal of Catalysis (2000–2008), member and convener of Chemistry Assessment Group of the Academic Degree Commission of the State Council, and Honorary President of Jiangsu Province Society of Chemistry and Chemical Industry (2005-). In addition, he has served as an Academic Board member for several State Key Laboratories in Chinese universities and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Professor Yi Chen is a man of enterprise and a high sense of responsibility. He has consistently advocated a learning style of being “rigorous, realistic, diligent and innovative” and personally practices it. During his more than 50 years of teaching and research, he has held important leadership positions in the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of Nanjing University. He has done much for the development of Nanjing University, the management and development of chemistry in China, and the reform of Chinese higher education. He has cultivated many talented students and made important contributions to the development of science, technology, and education in China. More details on Professor Yi Chen's life experience, research areas, and academic achievements are available in Brief Biography of Scientific and Technical Experts in China (chemistry volume, science section) compiled by China Association for Science and Technology and published by China Science and Technology Press in 2009. On the occasion of the 80th birthday of Professor Yi Chen, his students, collaborators, colleagues, and friends have gathered together to publish this special issue in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the development of catalysis and related areas in China. We would like to pay our highest tributes to Professor Yi Chen and sincerely wish him good health and happiness! We are very grateful to all authors, reviewers, and the editorial staff of the Chinese Journal of Catalysis for their hard work and strong support. May catalysis research in China thrive and prosper! Professor Weiping Ding received his BSc in Chemistry from Nanjing University in 1983 and his PhD in Chemistry from Nanjing University in 1992. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Physics, Nanjing University (1993–1995). He joined the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of Nanjing University in 1996 and was promoted to full professor in 2001. He has served as Vice Dean of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (2008–2011). He was a visiting scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, USA in 1999–2001, at Harvard University, USA in 2004–2005, at the National University of Singapore in 2013. Currently, he is the Director of the joint research lab of Nanjing University and SINOPEC on catalytic materials and technologies. His research has focused mainly on the development of advanced catalytic materials and applied technologies related to energy chemistry and chemical engineering processes, and recently focused on the development of the novel concepts of meso catalysis and its application in highly selective oxidation, hydrogenation, and solid acid catalyzed conversion of hydrocarbons. His research has pursued high performance and practical catalysts and processes all the time. Professor Wenhua Hou received his BSc in 1985, MSc in 1988, and PhD in 1993 in Physical Chemistry from Nanjing University. He was a research assistant in Nanjing Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (1988–1990), a visiting scholar at the State University of New York at Albany (1997–1998), and University of California at San Diego (2003). He joined School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University in 1993 and became a full professor there in 2000. His research interests include the preparation and catalytic & electrochemical performances of some novel layered and porous materials, and the fabrication and photoluminescence of nano-/micro-structured rare-earth materials. He has published more than 150 papers and won the first-and second-class science and technology progress awards from the State Education Ministry in 2010 and 1999. Professor Lin Dong received his BSc in 1984 and MSc in 1987 from South-West Normal University. He obtained his PhD in Physical Chemistry from Nanjing University in 1995. He was a post-doctoral fellow in Catalysis Centre, ESIP, Poitiers University, France (2000–2001, supported by the CNRS K. C. Wong in France). He joined School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University in 1997 and became a full professor there in 2002. His current research interests focus on the synthesis of metal-oxide nano-materials and the foundation of the surface interaction of the supported metal-oxide with in-situ characterizations, as well as their applications in the environment protection (especially for deNOx, CO oxidation). He has published more than 140 papers and won the second grade prize in science and technology of the Chinese university in 2001.",
