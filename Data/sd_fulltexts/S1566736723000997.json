The synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from carbon dioxide and methanol was studied over a ceria- zirconia mixed metal oxide. When using oxygen-18 labeled ceria-zirconia, no oxygen-18 labeled DMC or water was observed. On the other hand, using oxygen-18 labeled methanol led almost exclusively to the formation of double labeled DMC, CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3. These results were used to further elaborate the proposed reaction mechanisms for DMC synthesis. The rate-controlling step identified was that of a nucleophilic attack of gas phase methanol on surface monomethyl carbonate species to form DMC.

It is a versatile chemical [1] used as an important synthon for the production of polycarbonates, and a methylating agent, but it can also be used as an additive in gasoline, as a solvent in lithium-ion batteries, or as a substitute for volatile organic compounds in paints [2,3]. These large-scale applications aim to increase the global demand for DMC significantly in the coming years [4]. Current methods for the catalytic synthesis of DMC do not comply with green and sustainable chemistry. DMC was formerly produced on an industrial scale by phosgenation, but more recently by the oxidative carbonylation of methanol (Enichem process), or by the carbonylation of methyl nitrites (UBE process) [2,3]. All of these synthetic routes are polluting and toxic [5]. The carboxylation of methanol into DMC appears as a green and sustainable alternative, and it is produced according to the following Eq. (1): (1) However, the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction is strongly shifted to the side of the reactants; the conversion of methanol at equilibrium is <1% at reaction temperature. The selective withdrawal of the produced water yields higher conversions by shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium. In batch reactors, addition of various dehydrating reagents to reaction medium, as 2-cyanopyridine [6], led to almost complete methanol conversion. In flow reactor systems, continuous water withdrawal gives high conversion of methanol using membrane reactor [7]. A process combining a continuous reactor and a dehydrating agent reported a conversion of DMC up to 95% [8]. A large variety of catalysts has been evaluated in DMC synthesis, among which tin-based complexes in homogeneous catalysis, and metal oxides and metal-supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis [9]. The majority of metal oxides studied dealt with ceria, zirconia and cerium‑zirconium mixed metal oxides [10–12]. A review on DMC synthesis over ceria-based catalysts is given in ref. [13]. However, the reaction mechanism over ceria-based and related oxide catalysts remains not fully understood. Bell et al. [14,15] proposed a complete mechanism over ZrO2, based on infrared and Raman spectroscopic measurements. The adsorption of methanol is dissociative and produces water and methoxides species [16] through the reaction with terminal- or bridged hydroxyl groups. Jung and Bell [15] reported that only the terminal methoxy species are reactive. Next, direct insertion of carbon dioxide into the terminal methoxy species takes place, yielding monomethyl carbonate (MMC). This step does not involve bicarbonate species, which are too stable [15,16]. Less consensus is found for the last step, the formation of DMC by the reaction of methanol with MMC. This step was reported to be the rate-limiting step [17,18]. It is commonly proposed that the formation of DMC occurs by the transfer of a methyl species to a MMC species. This implies that the second methanol molecular species needs a Lewis acid site to be activated. Ikeda et al. [18] proposed the activation of methanol on a Brønsted acid site on the H3PO4/ZrO2 catalyst. Solid-state NMR measurements on the catalyst, liquid NMR on the reaction products, as well as DRIFTS led Aresta et al. [19] to propose the intervention of methanol in the gas phase to form DMC. DFT studies showed that the step with the lowest energy transition state is the one where two non-adsorbed methanol molecules attack the MMC via an intermolecular step. A study conducted using oxygen-18 labeled methanol (CH3 18OH) proposed that a methoxide species proceeds via a nucleophilic addition on MMC [20]. Recently, we have reported on Zr- doped ceria synthesized by flame-spray pyrolysis as an active and selective catalyst for the synthesis of DMC [21]. The highest activities of the CexZr1-xO2 catalysts were obtained for molar compositions (x) ranging between 0.4 and 0.8, but samples prepared by flame-spray pyrolysis were much more active than those prepared by co-precipitation. The objective of this study is to trace the oxygen atoms during the synthesis reaction of DMC. Do the oxygen atoms in DMC come from the surface and the core of the catalyst (Mars - van Krevelen-type mechanism), from carbon dioxide, or from methanol? By identifying their origin, steps in the proposed catalytic mechanism can be eliminated or confirmed. 2 Experimental Zr-doped ceria as well as pure ceria catalysts were prepared by flame spray pyrolysis as described elsewhere [21]. The flame spray pyrolysis sample was synthesized following a protocol described elsewhere [22,23]. Aqueous metal salt solutions were prepared with the desired concentration of metals. The solutions were sprayed into a flame (up to 2200 °C) as a fine mist. High space velocities and heat radiation loss led to extremely short residence times (milliseconds) with high temperature gradients along the flame-axis up to 170 K cm−1 [24]. The metal oxide clusters aggregated into nanoparticles, which were then collected on a filter. For this study, a sample with the composition Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was prepared and used, referred to as CZ-FSP. Its BET surface area amounted to ∼100 m2/g. Details on its characterization and performance in DMC synthesis are reported in [21]. To check if the lattice oxygen of CZ-FSP participates during the synthesis of DMC, the oxygen-16 atoms of CZ-FSP where exchanged for oxygen-18 atoms. The isotopic exchange was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (4 mm i.d.) with 300 mg of catalyst at 750 °C. The purchased isotopic oxygen 18O2 (Eurisotop) gas had an isotopic purity of 97.5%-atom. The sample was exposed to a flow of 16O2 and the flow was then switched to a flow of 18O2 by means of a 4-way chromatographic valve. The atomic mass numbers (m/z) 32, 34 and 36, representative of the oxygen isotopomers, were recorded at the exit of reactor as a function of time by a mass spectrometer (Inficon). Once a stable 18O2 flow was observed, the reactor was cooled down and the sample was recovered. This sample is referred to as18CZ-FSP. This experiment was repeated using only 50 mg of CZ-FSP, but now after the oxygen exchange, the reactor was cooled to 22 °C, purged with argon and then exposed to a flow of carbon dioxide. A similar experiment was conducted at 100 °C with similar results. The evaluation of catalytic activity was carried out using a method detailed elsewhere [25]. In the case of the DMC synthesis over the18CZ-FSP sample, and to minimize the use of CH3 18OH, a small volume semi-batch reactor (4 cm3) was used. The cell loaded with catalyst and CH3OH was placed in an oil-bath and kept at 120 °C. The carbon dioxide pressure (C16O2 in all cases) was maintained during the 2-h reaction at 50 bar by a syringe pump (Isco 250D). The measurements were performed with methanol conversions lower than 0.4%, thus far from thermodynamic equilibrium. At the end of the reaction, the liquid phase was recovered and filtered before being analyzed by a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC–MS, Shimadzu QP 2010). Only DMC and water were detected as products. The mass spectrum of the unlabeled DMC CH3 16 O (C 16 O) 16 OCH3, with a molar mass (M.M.) of 90 g mol−1 shows the highest fragment at 90 amu. DMC CH3 16 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3 has a molecular fragment at 92 amu instead of 90 amu, and DMC CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3 has a molecular fragment at 94 amu. 3 Results Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the three oxygen isotopomers as a function of time after the step-gas switch from 16O2 to 18O2 over CZ-FSP. At first, the appearance of 16O18O(g) is observed, followed by 18O2 shortly after. This indicates that a hetero-exchange occurs between 18O2 gas and surface 16O, in agreement with results reported [19]. The 16O18O transient response curve goes through a maximum, and then levels off to a steady-state formation rate, which corresponds to the 2.5% of 16O2 present in the 18O2 feed gas stream. The 18O2 response curve also reached steady-state, and at this point the exchange was stopped. From the integration of the 16O2 and 16O18O transient response curves, the total amount of exchanged oxygen was estimated to be ∼14 mmol/g. This corresponds to 6 monolayers, assuming a density of 14 O-atoms nm−2 [26]. 16O/18O exchange over 3 monolayers was reported [26] for similar experiments over Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 at 600 °C, while in another study 5 monolayers at 750 °C were reported [27]. Exposure of the oxygen-18 exchanged CZ-FSP sample to carbon dioxide resulted in the transient formation of small amounts of C16O18O (m/z = 46) and only traces of C18O2 (m/z = 48), as shown in Fig. 2 . At 22 °C, the amount of C16O18O corresponded to approximately 3% of the total amount of exchanged oxygen-18. No carbon monoxide, either labeled or unlabeled was observed. 18CZ-FSP was used for the synthesis of DMC with CH3 16OH and C16O2. During the reaction, the surface of 18CZ-FSP was composed of oxygen-16 atoms in the hydroxyl and carbonate groups due to the hydroxylation of the surface and adsorption of carbon dioxide after exposure to air, and water contained in methanol. Also, about six monolayers of oxygen in the crystal structure of CZ were labeled oxygen-18 atoms after the 16O/18O isotopic exchange performed. The GC–MS analysis of the obtained DMC indicated that it corresponds to CH3 16O(C16O)16OCH3. No oxygen-18 atoms were detected in DMC nor in the water produced. To detect whether oxygen-18 of18CZ-FSP participated in the reaction and was inserted into DMC, it was necessary to ensure that the number of oxygen-18 atoms available in18CZ-FSP was in large excess with respect to the oxygen involved in the DMC synthesis. The calculation showed that the number of oxygen-18 atoms in the18CZ-FSP sample during DMC synthesis, 4 mmol, was much larger than the 0.2 mmol of oxygen incorporated in the produced DMC. Thus, there were sufficient oxygen-18 atoms for the production of fully labeled DMC and water. Another experiment performed was the reaction between C16O2 and CH3 18OH over oxygen-16 CZ-FSP. The DMC produced consisted of 92% CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3 (M.M. = 94). It was identified through the fragment of m/z = 94 in the GC–MS analysis and by the low intensity of the fragment of m/z = 92, representative of CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 16 OCH3. The other larger majority fragments were a m/z = 31, 33, 47 and 61, also typical of CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3 with a shift of 2 amu's related to the mass of the oxygen-18 isotope. This result is consistent with the absence of H2 18O in the reaction products. Thus, the oxygen atoms of the two OCH3 groups of DMC stem exclusively from CH3 18OH, not from the catalyst surface oxygen-16 hydroxyl groups (16OH). 4 Discussion The absence of oxygen-18 in DMC when using an oxygen-18 exchanged ceria-zirconia catalyst implies that the reaction does not proceed according to a Mars van Krevelen-type redox mechanism, which consist of a two-step process, where oxygen of the catalyst is reacting with one of the reactants or product intermediates, followed by a re-oxidation of the catalyst. The formation of labeled carbon dioxide with 18O after exposure of the18CZ-FSP sample to C16O2 at temperatures as low as 22 °C points out the 16O/18O exchange in the carbonate adsorbed molecular species. The amount of C16O18O(g) formed corresponded to ∼400 μmol/g, less than the amount of 600 μmol/g of adsorbed carbon dioxide measured at 20 °C and 1 bar [28,29]. Several studies suggest that carbon dioxide adsorbs on oxygen vacancies, forming carbonate-type species [29–31]. The carbon dioxide exchange likely proceeds as depicted in Scheme 1 . The low number of exchanged oxygen atoms and the very low amount of C18O18O formed, indicates that only the oxygen atoms on the oxygen vacancy site are involved in the exchange process, in line with the theoretical model of carbon dioxide adsorption on ceria [31]. The 600 μmol/g of adsorbed CO2 corresponds to 3.6 molecules of CO2/nm2, or 25% of the total oxygen atoms/nm2, which is a rather high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies at room temperature. Therefore, other surface sites must probably be involved in the adsorption of carbon dioxide [32], but these are apparently not involved in the oxygen exchange at 22 °C. The absence of carbon monoxide excludes re-oxidation of the sample, in line with the results reported elsewhere [32]. The use of CH3 18OH over the oxygen-16 containing ceria-zirconia catalyst led to almost exclusively CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3 (M.M. = 94). Honda et al. [20] obtained a ratio of DMC (M.M. = 94) to DMC (M.M. = 92) of 3.6 for the DMC synthesis using CH3 18OH over pure ceria. These results can be interpreted by using the reaction mechanism proposed by Aresta et al. [19], shown in Scheme 2 , where oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 atoms are indicated by a green • and a red *, respectively. Methanol adsorbs dissociatively by reacting with a surface hydroxyl group to form a methoxy species and an unlabeled water molecule. Several studies indicated that carbonate species are formed through adsorption of carbon dioxide with oxygen vacancies, as mentioned above. Carbon dioxide is inserted into the methoxy species in the next step to form a monomethyl carbonate (MMC) –OCO18OCH3 species. Aresta et al. [19] used cross-polarization magic-angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify the MMC –OCOOCH3 species. They further showed that this species reacts with gas phase methanol, rather than methoxy species to form DMC. However, they suggested reaction path (I) to be the most likely, due to the observed reaction order in methanol that would correspond to the involvement of two methanol-derived species in the rate-controlling step. Moreover, DFT calculations over a similar system showed more favorable energetics for the tri-molecular system than the interaction with a single methanol molecule. On the other hand, Aresta et al. [19] argued that the tri-molecular mechanism may appear entropy forbidden. Re-examining the different reaction routes in the light of the results of the labeled methanol experiments, excludes directly the first two routes (I) & (II) shown in Scheme 2, for the conversion of MMC, –OC(O)18OCH3 species, as those routes yield H2 18O and only partially labeled DMC. Route (III) on the other hand, leads to the correctly labeled DMC and water products. However, our experiments do not exclude a nucleophilic attack from a (adsorbed) methoxy species, a reaction step not included in Scheme 2. DMC is thus formed by a nucleophilic addition of a CH3 18O methoxide species on MMC –OC(O)18OCH3 species. Honda et al. [20] reached the same conclusion for the synthesis of DMC over pure ceria. Cerium‑zirconium mixed metal oxides at intermediate compositions are more active than the pure oxides [21,31], although some contradictory results have been reported [33]. Stoian et al. [33] reported that pure ceria catalysts were more active than mixed ceria zirconia samples on a catalyst mass basis. Taking the specific activity (per BET surface area) for a more appropriate comparison, the mixed oxides showed the highest activity [33]. Zr-doped ceria can promote the catalyst's activity either by accelerating the rate-controlling step or by increasing the number of active sites. Daniel [29] measured apparent activation energies for the synthesis of DMC over Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and CeO2, both synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis, of 74 and 86 kJ/mol, respectively (Fig. 3 ). This corresponds to approximately a 30-fold increase in activity at 140 °C for the zirconia doped sample, which was observed experimentally for samples with similar surface areas [21]. Zr-doped ceria is known to increase the oxygen mobility [26]. It has been reported that the highest oxygen storage capacity of cerium‑zirconium mixed metal oxides, CexZr(1-x)O2, occurs for intermediate compositions, ca. 0.4 < x < 0.7 [34], just like the maximum activity for DMC synthesis [21]. However, a direct link between the oxidation state of cerium and the DMC yield has not been clearly established. According to the present work, surface or sub-surface lattice oxygen atoms are not participating to the synthesis of DMC, ruling out any causal correlation between the oxygen storage capacity and catalytic activity. A more likely explanation is that Zr-doped ceria weakens the metal‑oxygen bond, thus lowering the activation energy of this step. The MMC species have been observed by IR spectroscopy under reaction conditions, and it seems to be stable intermediate. Step (III) in Scheme 2 is thus likely the rate-controlling step. In this step, MMC* reacts with gaseous methanol as shown by Aresta et al. [19] but also by the present labeled methanol experiments. According to the results shown in Fig. 2, the activation energy of the MMC* + CH3OH(g) step is lower by 12 kJ/mol over the ceria-zirconia than pure ceria. As MMC* is the only surface species involved in this step, its stability is lower due probably to a weaker metal‑oxygen bond. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 . In the case of a methoxy species being involved, the stability of both species is likely to be affected. 5 Conclusions The synthesis of DMC from carbon dioxide and methanol have been studied using either a partially oxygen-18 labeled ceria-zirconia or oxygen-18 labeled methanol. These experiments allowed to shed light on the reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism consists of three steps: (i) reaction between methanol and surface hydroxyl groups to form water and methoxy species, (ii) reaction between carbon dioxide and surface methoxy species to give surface MMC species, and (iii) a nucleophilic attack of methanol/methoxy species on the MMC species to yield DMC, which is considered to be the rate-controlling step. The oxygen atoms in DMC stem either from methanol or carbon dioxide, but oxygen atoms from Zr-doped ceria do not participate in the reaction. The role of Zr cation present in the crystal structure of Zr-doped ceria is to weaken the metal‑oxygen bond of the MMC species and thus accelerate the reaction by lowering the activation energy of the last step. However, further studies are necessary to confirm this statement, for example, through ab initio calculations (DFT studies).

        "dc:description": "The synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from carbon dioxide and methanol was studied over a ceria- zirconia mixed metal oxide. When using oxygen-18 labeled ceria-zirconia, no oxygen-18 labeled DMC or water was observed. On the other hand, using oxygen-18 labeled methanol led almost exclusively to the formation of double labeled DMC, CH3 18 O (C 16 O) 18 OCH3. These results were used to further elaborate the proposed reaction mechanisms for DMC synthesis. The rate-controlling step identified was that of a nucleophilic attack of gas phase methanol on surface monomethyl carbonate species to form DMC.",
