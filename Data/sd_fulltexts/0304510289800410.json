V. SUBBA RAO, K. MUKKANTI and B. M. CHOUDARY** Homogeneous Catalysis Discipline, Regional Research Laboratory, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received August 1, 1988; accepted October 4,1988) Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl and nitro groups is a very useful tool for the synthetic organic chemist. Although many homogeneous/heter- ogenised complexes are known to hydrogenate alkenes and alkynes, few such complexes are reported to catalyse the reduction of carbonyl and nitro groups. High pressures and temperatures are generally employed in homoge- neous catalysis for the hydrogenation of carbonyl and nitrobenzene with very good yields [1 -7]. The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene by the most thoroughly investigated homogeneous ruthenium catalysts was conducted at 50 -100 atm and 90 -130 C [4, 8, 9]. Baralt and Holy used high pressures in the range of 500 - 800 psi and 70 -100 C for the reduction of nitroben- zene to aniline with polymer-anchored anthranilic acid palladium complexes, and found that the homogeneous species is responsible for the hydrogena- tion [6]. The complex Pd^PPh^yCl^ homogeneously catalyzed reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline, affording 75% yield at atmospheric pressure and quantitative yield at high pressure [7]. Intercalation of various complexes in the interlayers of montmorillonite is of current interest. Encapsulated cationic complexes in the interiamellars of montmorillonite have been used for the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes [10]. We have covalently ligated montmorillonite with various ligands and employed them for the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes [11, 12]. In this letter, we report the synthesis and characterisation of interlamellar montmorillonite 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (IA) and its palladium(II) complex (IB) for the first time and the selective reduction of aromatic carbon'yls only to the corresponding carbinols and nitrobenzene to aniline at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The Na-montmorillonite, which was prepared from commercial mont- morillonite KIO (Fluka), a class of smectite clay, by the procedure of Posner *RRL-H Communication No. 2222. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L48 and Quirk [13] was treated with 0.1 N HC1 to afford H-montmorillonite [14]. Montmorillonite interlamellar 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (IA) was prepared by the reaction of H-montmorillonite (10.0 g) with 3-amino- propyltriethoxysilane (1.55 g, 7.0 mmol) in dry toluene under reflux in inert atmosphere for about 48 h. This on complexation with dichlorobis(benzyl- cyano)palladium(II) in dry benzene under stirring at room temperature gave a dirty red-coloured palladium(II) complex (Scheme 1). Both ligand IA and complex IB were subjected to Soxhiet extraction with benzene for about 8h. From chemical analysis, the Pd:N:Cl ratio was determined to be ap- proximately 1:1:2. The IR spectra of the ligand (IA) and the complex (IB) showed all the silylpropyi amine bands. In addition, complex (IB) showed a band at 350 cm\"1 indicating the presence of the terminal/ trans Pd Cl [10, 15]. X-ray powder diffraction (thin film) indicated a basal region expansion (dooi) 18.8 A for IA and 20.1 A for IB respectively from 9.4 A for dehydrated montmorillonite. The analytical, XRD and IR data indicate that the palladium complex (IB) is most likely present in a three-coordinate state in the interlamellars of montmorillonite. The possibility of a fourth coordination with silicate oxygen cannot be ruled out [15]. The hydrogenation reactions were conducted under mild conditions in a 100 ml flask. The catalyst (100 mg, 0.025 mmol of Pd), EtOH (15 ml) and substrate (2.5 mmol) were introduced at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a classical hydrogenation apparatus. The catalyst IB hydrogenates aldehydes, ketones, diketones and nitro- benzene (Table 1) at room temperature and pressure, and yields are quantita- tive. The initial rate of hydrogen uptake in the case of aldehydes and nitro groups is very high and the rate of H; absorption is constant till the end of reaction. The rate of Ha uptake in hydrogenation of aldehydes (entries 1 and 2) is greater than the analogous palladium complex of silica-bound 3-aminopropylsiloxane, when the reaction is conducted under identical conditions [16]. The carbonyls of benzil are hydrogenated selectively and sequentially as described (entries 5 and 6). However, l-phenyl-l,2-propane- dione is hydrogenated to l-phenyl-l-hydroxy-2-propanone selectively (entry 7). Aromatic carbonyls are hydrogenated, while there is no hydrogen absorption for aliphatic carbonyls; this is further substantiated by the selective reduction of aromatic ketones (entries 7, 8, 9) in the presence of aliphatic ketones in the same molecule. These results are in contrast to the results obtained with the silica-bound catalyst, which shows no selectivity [16] in reduction of carbonyls. The high catalytic activity and selectivity as described above is ascribed to the change in electronic and coordination environment of the complex brought about in the interlay ers of montmorillonite. The XRD and IR data of the used catalyst are identical to those of the catalyst before hydrogenation. The elemental analyses of the Pd and N remain the same, while the Pd:Cl ratio decreased to 1.7 from 2.0. The oxida- tion state of the palladium was determined by Bailar's method [17, 18]; L49 TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of carbonyls and nitrobenzene Entry No. Substrott Product InitioIHguptoke0 (ml/min) 1 ^\" l^\"20\" IZ.O1' 2 3 ,x\" igr^cH, ^^^CHgOH HgC OH ( ^\"3 .S.O'1 0-8 4 (^@ 1\"[gr^ 1-0 5 @\\@ @^c 5-0 6 @\\@ OHr^rM6]U^J OH''^ 50 7 (grV\"- OH( rV\"' 15-0 8 r1-^\"' @^c\". 1-2 9 ^^c \"H-.^O'-^ J^^^T-'00\"HgOO\"-- 1-0 10 (gr'02 -\"\"' 35-0 a0.025 mmol of Pd and 2.6 mmol of substrate. ^'0.075 mmol of Pd and 0.05 mol of substrate.

The catalyst displayed less than 1% of its original hydrogenation activity after the extractive treatment. All these results demonstrate that hydrogena- tion has not been effected via a route involving tiny metallic Pd particles. The selective reduction of aromatic carbonyl and nitrobenzene with our catalyst is highly impressive and can be easily adapted to any laboratory, as reaction conditions are very mild and convenient.
