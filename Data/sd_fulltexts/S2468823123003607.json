And quinazoline derivatives have been reported to possess a broad range of biological and therapeutic properties, including antitumor [4,5], antibacterial [6,7], antioxidant [8,9], anti-inflammatory [10,11], antiplasmodial [12,13] and antimicrobial [14,15]. A number of quinazoline-based drugs are shown in Fig. 1 . Prazosin, an orally available sympatholytic drug, has been approved to treat anxiety, hypertension and post-traumatic stress disorder [16,17]. Erlotinib and Gefitinib act as potent inhibitors of the tyrosine-kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and have been extensively utilized for the treatment of different types of cancers [18,19]. Trimetrexate, a potent competitive inhibitor of bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian dihydrofolate reductase, is commonly used in the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia [20]. CCT241533 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CHK2 (ckpoint kinase 2) which blocks CHK2 activity in human tumor cell lines in response to DNA damage [21,22]. Furthermore, quinazolines are not only used as important intermediates of organic chemical reactions, but are also applied as valuable building blocks in preparing organic functional materials [23,24]. Owing to their great application prospects in various fields, quinazoline and its derivatives have attracted significant attention over the past decades [25,26]. Because of the wide demand for diverse quinazoline derivatives, numerous synthetic strategies have been developed for the construction of quinazoline skeleton. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , the current synthetic strategies for quinazolines are mainly as follows: (i) the cyclization reaction of N-phenylbenzamidines [27,28]; (ii) the two-component cyclization reaction of 2-aminoaryl ketones with benzylamines [29–31]; (iii) the three-component cyclization reaction of 2-aminoaryl ketones and aldehydes in the presence of N source [32–34]. Alternatively, quinazolines can be synthesized by decoration of the existing quinazoline unit or dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolines [35]. Despite the progress made in past quinazolines synthetic studies, some of these strategies suffer from one or the other limitations, such as availability of starting materials, harsh reaction conditions, usage of hazardous and volatile solvents, excess amounts of oxidant or toxic and expensive metal catalysts, which has limited the applicability of these synthetic strategies in high throughput synthesis. In consequence, the pursuit of alternative efficient synthetic strategies to obtain quinazolines has never ceased. In recent years, visible light as a renewable and green energy resource has attracted extensive attention in assisting catalytic organic synthesis reactions, since they offer many attractive superiorities, such as mild reaction conditions, minimal side reactions, simple experimental setup and environmental friendliness [36,37]. Lots of published papers demonstrated that visible light-induced photocatalytic synthetic strategies was an ideal alternative to traditional strategies [38,39]. In our previous studies, we successfully developed a green and straightforward approach for synthesis of benzothiazoles and quinazolin-4(3H)-ones via visible light-induced condensation cyclization [40,41]. Moreover, a catalyst-free, facile and efficient visible light-mediated strategy was reported for the synthesis of sulfoxides through the oxidation of sulfides [42]. As part of our continuing effort in this field, we would like to disclose here a facile and catalyst-free strategy for visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines via one-pot three-component reaction of 2-aminoaryl ketones, aldehydes and ammonium acetate at room temperature. We believed that the present strategy not only offered a green and sustainable chemistry approach for the synthesis of quinazolines, but also exhibited promising prospects in the field of synthetic chemistry. 2 Results and discussion At the initial stage of investigation, 2-aminobenzophenone 1a and benzaldehyde 2a were chosen as the model substrates under blue LED irradiation to optimize the reaction conditions, and a series of reaction conditions including photocatalysts, N sources and solvents were investigated (Table 1 ). We first examined our reaction with 2-aminobenzophenone and benzaldehyde, ammonium acetate as a N source and fluorescein as a photocatalyst in CH3CN, and got the desired product 3aa in 89% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Meanwhile, some alternative photocatalysts, i.e. rhodamine B and eosin Y, were also examined (Table 1, entry 2–3). To our delight, without using any photocatalysts, the desired product 3aa was obtained in the same high yield (Table 1, entry 4). Encouraged by these results, we next explored the reaction under catalyst-free condition. In a different series, the influence of N sources on the reaction yield of the product was studied under catalyst-free condition. Of the examined N sources, ammonium acetate showed the best performance giving the desired product 3aa in a higher yield, whereas other N sources such as ammonium chloride and aq. ammonia resulted the corresponding product in 35% and 76% yields, respectively (Table 1, entry 4–6). Afterwards, the solvent effect on reaction efficiency was also investigated. Compared with CH3CN, slightly lower yield was observed when the reaction was performed in other organic solvents such as CH3OH, THF, toluene, acetone and DMF (Table 1, entry 7–11). Besides, the reaction yield could be further decreased to 56% when using H2O as the reaction solvent (Table 1, entry 12). And the desired product 3aa was obtained in 78% yield when the reaction was performed in a mixture solution of CH3CN/H2O as the reaction solvent (Table 1, entry 13). After extensive screening of the solvent, CH3CN was proved to be a suitable reaction solvent, producing the desired product 3aa in 89% yield. After a series of reaction conditions optimization, the optimal reaction conditions for the visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines are as follows: 2-aminobenzophenone 1a, benzaldehyde 2a and ammonium acetate in CH3CN, blue LED as the light source under air atmosphere at room temperature. With the optimal reaction conditions in hand, we next examined the generality and limitations of this visible light-induced strategy. The substrate scope with respect to aldehydes 2 was explored first with 2-aminobenzophenone 1a. As given in Table 2 , aromatic aldehydes bearing a functional group at the para position all reacted smoothly to provide the corresponding quinazolines in excellent yields (3ae-3ai), and aromatic aldehydes bearing an electron-withdrawing group produced a slightly higher yield of the desired products than those bearing an electron-donating group. The ortho-substituted and meta-substituted aromatic aldehydes were transformed into the corresponding quinazolines in slightly lower yields (3ab-3ad) implying that the reaction was sensitive to steric hindrance of the aromatic aldehydes. Meanwhile, the multi-substituted aromatic aldehyde namely 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 2j worked to afford the desired product 3aj in a similar yield. Furthermore, heterocyclic aldehydes, such as 2-picolylaldehyde 2k and 2-thiophenaldehyde 2l, were well tolerated, and the corresponding quinazolines 3ak and 3al were obtained in 84% and 81% yield, respectively. Aliphatic aldehydes, such as propionaldehyde 2m and isobutyraldehyde 2n, also participated in the reaction to provide the corresponding quinazolines 3am and 3an in moderate yields. We further investigated the substrate scope of 2-aminoaryl ketones 1 in the visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines as shown in Table 3 . All of the reactions worked well to produce the corresponding quinazolines in moderate to excellent yields. The methyl-substituted and aryl-substituted ketones showed similar yields which verified that the efficiency was not affected by the steric bulk of 2-aminoaryl ketones. For example, 2-aminoacetophenone 1e produced the desired product 3ea in 90% yield, and aryl-substituted ketones 1b-1d produced the corresponding quinazolines 3ba-3da in 89%−94% yields. In addition, halogen substituents such as bromo and chloro on the aniline ring were also well tolerated in this transformation, and gave the corresponding quinazolines 3fa-3ia in good yields. To gather more information about the reaction mechanism, some control experiments were conducted as shown in Scheme 2 . The first experiment under the standard reaction conditions gave 3aa in a good yield (89%) with that of the same product obtained in the studied strategy (Scheme 2, Eq. (i)). When the reaction was performed in a dark atmosphere, the desired product 3aa was not obtained (Scheme 2, Eq. (ii)). The results revealed that the reaction was almost completely inhibited in the absence of light. Under similar conditions but in a nitrogen atmosphere, no desired product 3aa was detectable (Scheme 2, Eq. (iii)). In contrast, when the reaction was performed in an oxygen atmosphere, the desired product 3aa was obtained in a 89% yield (Scheme 2, Eq. (iv)). Thus, it was reasonable to assume that a molecular oxygen atmosphere was essential for the studied reaction. On the basis of above experimental results and literature precedents [43–45], a plausible mechanism of visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines is proposed as shown in Scheme 3 . First of all, the reaction of 2-aminoaryl ketones 1 and aldehydes 2 leads to the formation of Schiff's base intermediate 4, which is obtained by nucleophilic addition and dehydration under blue LED irradiation. Subsequently, the carbonyl in intermediate 4 reacts with ammonium acetate to give ketimine 5, which after intramolecular cyclization generates dihydroquinazoline 6. Finally, intermediate 6 is converted to the desired product 3 by O2-promoted aromatization via oxidation. Furthermore, only a trace amount of product 3 is obtained in the absence of air or under a nitrogen atmosphere. This result indicates that air is necessary in the process for the visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines. 3 Conclusions In summary, we successfully developed a facile and efficient strategy for visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines via one-pot three-component reaction of 2-aminoaryl ketones, aldehydes and ammonium acetate under catalyst-free condition. The reactions proceeded smoothly, affording the corresponding quinazolines in high to excellent yields with good functional group tolerance. Moreover, a plausible mechanism of visible light-induced synthesis of quinazolines was proposed based on the control experiments and literature reports. The application of this strategy for preparation of other valuable organic products is underway in our laboratory. 4 Experimental 4.1 Chemistry All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. All reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica-gel 60 F254 plates (Merck). Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (200–300 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125 MHz on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer at ambient temperature (25 °C) with TMS as an internal standard. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet), coupling constants (Hz) and integration. Fluorescence spectra of the synthesized compounds were taken using a CREE XPE 30 W blue LED as light sources. 4.2 General procedure for synthesis of quinazolines To a flat quartz glass jar was charged 2-aminoaryl ketones 1 (1.0 mmol), aldehydes 2 (1.2 mmol), ammonium acetate (5.0 mmol) and CH3CN (20 mL). The open-air reaction container was irradiated with a CREE XPE 30 W blue LED (approximately 10 cm away from the light source) at room temperature. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC analysis), the mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. Then, water was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography to generate the corresponding product 3. 4.2.1 2,4-Diphenylquinazoline (3aa) 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO‑d 6): δ (ppm) 8.62–8.60 (m, 2H), 8.13 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 8.07 (dd, J = 8.4, 1.4 Hz, 1H), 8.03–8.00 (m, 1H), 7.88 (dd, J = 6.6, 3.0 Hz, 2H), 7.70–7.65 (m, 4H), 7.57–7.56 (m, 3H);
