The aza-Michael reactions of amines with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compounds have efficiently been carried out at room temperature using Amberlyst-15 as a heterogeneous reusable catalyst. The products were formed in short reaction times and in high yields. Graphical abstract . Keywords Aza-Michael reaction Amine α,β-Unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compounds Amberlyst-15 Heterogeneous reusable catalyst The aza-Michael reaction involving the conjugate addition of a nitrogen nucleophiles to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl or nitrile compounds constitutes an important reaction in organic synthesis for the construction of C–N bond and for the preparation of a β-amino carbonyl or nitrile compounds [1]. Various β-amino carbonyl compounds are present in bioactive natural products and are also useful for the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [2]. The aza-Michael reactions are usually carried out under acid and base catalysis [3]. However, to avoid the problems associated with a strong acid or a base which may initiate the side reactions, various Lewis acids have been introduced [4]. Many of these Lewis acid induce several drawbacks, such as Yb(OTf)3 [4a] and CeCl3·7H2O–NaI [4c] require drastic reaction conditions and toxic solvent, MeCN, CeCl3·7H2O–NaI [4c] is used in large excess and InCl3 [4b] and Cu-salt [4f] complete the conversion in long reaction times. As the aza-Michael reaction is of versatile use in organic synthesis a mild, facile and eco-friendly protocol for this reaction is highly essential. In continuation of our work [5] on the application of Amberlyst-15 for development of useful synthetic methodologies we recently observed that it can catalyse efficiently the aza-Michael reactions of amines with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compounds at room temperature (Scheme 1 ). The reaction was conducted under solvent-free conditions. Initially, the reaction was attempted with different solvents (Table 1 ) but the yields were found to be better in absence of any solvent. A series of β-amino carbonyl and nitrile compounds were prepared by direct treatment of amines with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compounds in the presence of Amberlyst-15 (Table 2 ). Both the primary and secondary aliphatic amines underwent the conversion smoothly. Primary amines, such as benzyl amine, phenylethyl amine or n-butyl amine reacted with an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compound to form only the corresponding mono-alkylated product. The method worked well for α,β-unsaturated esters, nitriles and ketons (acyclic or cyclic). The reaction was completed within 10–30min. The yields of the products were high (76–98%) with aliphatic amines. However, when an aromatic amine, such as aniline, was treated with an α,β-unsaturated ester or nitrile the yield of the adduct was low (∼30% in 2h) but the similar reaction with methyl vinyl ketone afforded the desired product in impressive yield (92% in 1h). This difference in reactivity of aromatic amines with α,β-unsaturated esters or nitriles shows the chemoselectivity of conjugate addition of aliphatic amines in the present method. Thus, when a mixture (1:1) of morpholine and aniline was treated with an excess methyl acrylate in the presence of Amberlyst-15, only the morpholine adduct was formed as the sole product (Scheme 2 ). The catalyst, Amberlyst-15, is commercially available, inexpensive and non-hazardous. It works under heterogeneous conditions and can easily be handled and removed by simple filtration. The recovered catalyst was recycled consecutively three times to produce the desired products with a little variation of their yields (Table 2). In conclusion, we have developed an efficient general methodology for the preparation of β-amino carbonyl and nitrile compounds by applying aza-Michael reactions of amines and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl and nitrile compounds in the presence of Amberlyst-15. The simple experimental procedure, application of an inexpensive heterogeneous recyclable catalyst, solvent-free reaction conditions, short reaction times and high yields are the notable advantages of the protocol. 1 Experimental 1.1 Typical experimental procedure To a mixture of methyl acrylate (2.5mmol) and Amberlyst-15 (65mg, 30%, w/w) was added morpholine (2mmol) and stirred at room temperature for 30min. TLC indicated the completion of the reaction. CH2Cl2 (10mL) was added and the catalyst was separated by filtration. The solvent was evaporated from the filtrate and the residue was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, hexane-EtOAc) to obtain pure product (79%). The recovered catalyst was recycled for consecutive three times for the above reaction to furnish the product with a little variation of its yield (Table 1).
