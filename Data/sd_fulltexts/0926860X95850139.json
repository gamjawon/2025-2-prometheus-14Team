These catalysts showed good activities and selectivities in the synthesis of C ,-C6 alcohols from a CO+H2 mixture. These alcohols have an Anderson-Schulz-Flory type distribution. The influence of promoters and reaction conditions on the reactivities were investigated and compared. Co favors the chain growing process, and in that respect, it is more effective than Fe or Ni whereas Mo enhances only the hydrogenating power of the catalyst and so increases the total conversion. In the knowledge of the reaction mechanism, TPD after acetaldehyde adsorption and probe molecules experiments gave strong evidence of the insertion of a C, oxygen-containing species into an alkyl chain. Keywords: Carbon monoxide; Cobalt; Copper; Higher alcohol synthesis; Rare earth oxides 1. Introduction Production of Ct-C6 alcohol mixtures can be considered as a possible added value pathway for natural gas passing through the intermediacy of syngas [ 1 ] . The obtained alcohols have been proposed for various utilizations such as solvent, fuel, or additives such as octane boosters in gasoline. The higher alcohol synthesis catalysts cited in the literature [2-6] can be described either as Co- (or Ni-) promoted copper methanol or as copper-promoted cobalt hydrocarbon synthesis catalysts. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Copper-based catalysts are known to be successful in methanol synthesis and in addition to conventional Cu0-Zn0-A1203 systems [7,8], CuLa2Zr207 catalysts have shown good methanol activity [9] . Further, cobalt-based catalysts are known to produce hydrocarbons [ 10,11 ] through the intermediate formation of surface alkyl species after CO dissociation on the metal surface. On Co-Cu /ZnA1204, a mechanism has been proposed by several authors [ 1214]. In that mechanism (Scheme 1) , the chain growth is based on the reaction between a C, oxygenated species (formyl or CO) which can be formed on the copper surface and a carbene (or hydrocarbon) entity located on Co or at the Co-Cu interface. Therefore the catalysts have to take up several functions: - formation of chemisorbed C, oxygenated moieties, - formation of alkene or alkyl species, - insertion of C, oxygenates into the hydrocarbon metal bond. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of group VIII and group VI metal oxides' (e.g. through cobalt or molybdenum derivates) addition to a CuLa2Zr207 catalyst which was prepared in our laboratory and which was proven to have good properties for methanol formation from CO + HZ and COZ + Hz [ 9 ] . 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The CuLa2Zr20, catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation by oxalic acid of a mixed solution of Cu(N03)2 - 3H20, La(N03)3 - 6H20 and Zr (C3H70) 4 in ethanol [ 9 ] . The precipitate was washed by ethanol, dried at 60 C and calcined at 550 C for 12 hours or at 700 C for 2 hours. The copper catalyst was impregnated by aqueous solutions of Co (N03)2 - 6H20 and/or (NH4)6Mo7024 - H20 in suitable amounts. The impregnates were then dried and calcined at 350 C in argon or in air. 2.2. Catalytic activities The tests were carried out in a stainless steel continuous flow reactor (6 mm I.D.) containing 0.5 g of catalyst as described elsewhere [9]. W. Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 95-111 97 The catalysts were reduced in a 41 h` gcat.' HZ flow. The reduction temperature was increased (1 C min-') from 20 to 250 C, and then maintained at 250 C for 6 hours. Reaction conditions: pressure = 6 MPa, syngas flow = 41 h -' gcat' , CO/H2 ratio 1 /2. The temperature was increased by 24 hour steps from 250 to 260, 270 and 280 C. The formed alcohols were condensed in a cold liquid trap at 10 C. The inlet and outlet gases were analyzed by on-line GC. The carbon balance was at least 95%. The yields, conversions and selectivities were determined with an accuracy of 5%. They are defined as follows: yield in product i = number of CO moles converted in product i number of introduced CO moles conversion = number of converted CO moles number of introduced CO moles selectivity in product i = number of moles converted in product i number of converted CO moles 2.3. Characterization of catalysts 2.3.1. CO chemisorption 0.5 g of catalysts were reduced in a glass microreactor following the same procedure as for the catalytic tests, cooled to room temperature and flushed with a 4 1 h-' gcat.' helium flow for 2 h. Then 0.87 ml pulses of pure carbon monoxide were admitted to the catalysts until no further chemisorption was observed. 2.3.2. TPR techniques The tests were performed in a glass microreactor at atmospheric pressure. 0.5 g of catalysts were calcined at 300 C in a 41 h` gcat.' He flow for 2 hours, and then cooled to 100 C. After stabilization, the temperature was raised with a slope of 1 C up to 500 C under a 41 h-' gcat.' 10% H2 in N2 mixture. The water formation was monitored in the gas flow by a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3.3. TPD experiments They were performed in equipment similar to that used in the TPR tests. After reducing the catalyst with the same procedure as in the catalytic tests, the reactor was flushed by a 41 h-' gcat.' He flow for 30 min. CH3CH0 was chemisorbed by passing a mixture of 1.3 kPa CH3CH0 in 100 kPa He for 15 min on the catalyst. After flushing again with 41 h-' gcat.' He for 2 hours, the temperature was increased with a 5 C min-' slope up to 500 C. The outlet gas was analyzed by FID and TCD gas chromatography. 98 W. Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 95-111 2.4. Probe molecule experiments 0.5 g of catalysts were reduced in a glass tube reactor under the same conditions as for the catalytic tests. The probe molecule was introduced in small amounts ( 2 mol-%) into the CO + HZ flow when the steady-state was reached at 225 C, at atmospheric pressure with a 41 h-' gcat-' CO + 2H2 mixture. The formed gaseous products were analyzed on stream by FID gas chromatography. 3. Results and discussion i 3.1. Preparation and characterization of the catalysts The preparation of the monometallic catalysts has been extensively described elsewhere [ 9 ] . It has been shown that coprecipitation of mixed oxalates led to the best results in the preparation of the CuLa2Zr207 catalyst precursors. Copper loading and calcination conditions influence the catalytic behavior of these monometallic systems. Two typical preparations were used in our tests: - 40% CuLa2Zr207 calcined at 700 C in air, with a BET surface area of 33 m2/g. - 50% CuLa2Zr207 calcined at 550 C in air, with a BET surface area of 48 m2/g. The characteristics and the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic catalysts depend on the cobalt content and on the annealing conditions (temperature, media) of the impregnated catalysts. From Table 1, it can be seen that the BET surface area decreases very rapidly with increasing calcination temperatures. The reactivity of the catalysts measured under the conditions given in Table 1 also decreases for higher annealing temperatures. When the formation of alcohols is considered, calcination in the presence of air is more beneficial than heating in the presence of an inert gas. As can be seen from Table 1, a 36% alcohol selectivity is observed for calcination under air whereas Table 1 Influence of annealing on a Co/CuLa2Zr207 catalyst T ( C) Media SBET (M2/g) Conversion' (%) Selectivity (%) ROH CZ+OH/ROH (wt.-%) 350 Air 33.7 12.9 36 51.6 350 Ar 31.3 12 14 54.2 500 Ar 21.6 11.4 13 53.2 700 Ar 9.3 11.2 8 33.8 Catalyst 5% Co/40%a CuLa2Zr207, calcined 3 h at 700 C.

For conditions: see the Experimental section. only a 14% alcohol selectivity for about the same CO conversion can be achieved on the catalysts annealed in argon. 99 3.2. Reducibility of the catalysts TPR experiments show that copper favors the reduction of cobalt. The spectra of three model catalysts given in Fig. 1 show that under our conditions the reduction peak maximum for the cobalt catalyst is situated at 316 C and for the copper system at 218 C. For the bimetallic 5% Co/CuLa2Zr207 system only one reduction peak maximum is observed at 255 C. This phenomenum suggests an interaction between copper and cobalt whose nature has not clearly been elucidated in the literature [ 15,16] . This interaction lowers the reduction temperature of Co304. This phenomenon was also reported by Mouaddib and Perrichon [ 15] and Baillard-Letournel et al. [ 16] . According to the results of Courty et al. [ 17], Co304 is reduced into 95% Coo and only 5% Co' is observed in the temperature range of our catalytic tests. A total M co LO W 300- U) N Lo 04 200- .

Conditions: see the Experimental section. reduction of the cobalt can only be obtained at a temperature between 500 and 700 C [ 17 ] . For molybdenum promoted systems the TPR spectra are given in Fig. 2 and are compared to the unpromoted Co/CuLa2Zr207 catalyst. It can be observed that the peak maximum for the reduction of a 3% Mo+Co/CuLaZZr20-, catalyst (254 C) is very near that of the unpromoted system (255 C) whereas a higher Mo content weakly increases these temperature. However, as will be shown in the catalytic test part, the promoted catalyst is much more active than the unpromoted one. This indicates that the good performance of the promoted system is not only determined by the reducibility of the catalyst when Mo is added. The weak reduction of the cobalt and molybdenum oxides during the reduction procedure (and under reaction conditions) is also evidenced by CO chemisorption. 3.3. CO chemisorption CO chemisorption results on promoted 50% CuLa2Zr207 catalysts are shown in Table 2 and indicate that the addition of Mo and/or Co results in a decreased amount of CO adsorbed on the metal surface. It can also be seen that the amount of chemisorbed CO drops when the MoOx content of the catalyst is enhanced. A tentative explanation of this phenomenum could be that Mo and/or Co are deposited on the copper metal surface in some kind of decoration. The so-decreased accessible copper metal surface area would explain the decrease of CO chemisorption since according to the literature [ 17 ] these oxides are only partially reduced under the reaction conditions and do not adsorb CO. 3.4. Comparison with monometallic systems The formation of methanol on copper catalysts and of hydrocarbons on cobalt ones is in agreement with the literature [ 7-11 ] . Under our reaction conditions (Table 3) , only methanol is produced on CuLa2Zr207 and no chain growth is observed, whereas on the Co/CuLa2Zr20, bimetallic catalyst higher alcohols as W. Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 95-Ill 101 Table 3 Catalytic behavior of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts Catalysts Conversion (%) Selectivities (%) CZ+OH/ROH (wt.-%) MeOH CZ+OH RH CuLa2Zr207 37.7 13.5 1 5.5 - 1 Co/La2Zr207 4.8 11.5 8.5 80 43.3 Co/CuLa2Zr207 12.9 19 17 64 51.6 Catalysts: 50% CuLa2Zr207, 5% Co/LaZZr207, 5% Co/50% CuLazZr207. Reaction conditions: CO +2H2 gas flow: 41 h-' g.e,' , P=6 MPa, T=270 C. well as hydrocarbons are formed. The proportion of C2+ alcohols in the alcohol fraction amounts to 48%, and an interesting chain growth is observed. CoLa2Zr207 also gives hydrocarbons and alcohols, the higher alcohol fraction represents 43% of the total alcohol production. However the bimetallic Co-Cu has an activity which is almost four times as high as that of the Co catalyst with a higher total alcohol selectivity. These results are in good agreement with those claimed by Courty et al. in an IFP patent [3-6] on ZnA1204 supported Co-Cu catalysts. 3.5. Alcohol distribution The alcohols obtained on the 5% Co/50% CuLa2Zr207 catalysts are mainly linear, and less than 15% iso-alcohols are observed in the C4 alcohol fraction. Their distribution (Fig. 3) is in agreement with an Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) type distribution as stated in the literature [ 18 ] and indicates a chain growth mechanism by successive addition of a Ct species with the same probability as in the insertion process previously proposed for the chain growth. A slight difference appears for methanol formation which is higher than expected. This can be explained if one remembers that CuLa2Zr207 is a methanol producing catalyst. 3.6. Influence of the cobalt content Six samples with increasing Co contents up to 10% have been tested as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. It can be seen that the addition of only a slight amount of cobalt sharply decreases methanol formation. This has also been observed by Lin and Pennella [ 19] on Co-Cu/Zr02 and was attributed to a covering of the methanolactive copper sites by cobalt oxides. However, the higher alcohols (C2 + OH) and hydrocarbons (C2 + HC) yields increase with the amount of cobalt as well as the C2 + OH proportion in the total alcohol fraction. A good 60% content of C2+ OH alcohols in the alcohol mixture but a low alcohol selectivity is observed with a 10% Co loading (Fig. 5) . Finally 102 W.

Reaction condition: CO+2H2 gas flow 4 1 h-' g ', P=6 MPa, T=280 C. the best compromise between activity and selectivity was obtained with the catalyst loaded with 5% cobalt. Such a simultaneous increase of CZ + OH and CZ + HC yields have also be reported for Rh catalysts by Ichikawa [ 20,21 ] , and van den Berg et al. [ 22 ] , and on cobalt-containing catalysts by Takeuchi et al. [ 23 ] . A common intermediate for the formation of both compounds was proposed [ 12-14] . A competition in the growing chain between CHZ addition leading to hydrocarbons and an insertion of a C, oxygenated species (formyl or adsorbed CO) resulting in alcohol formation could be observed. Thus the amount of cobalt on the surface influences the chain growth both to hydrocarbons and alcohols and only a good compromise can lead to the optimization of an improved alcohol producing catalyst. 3.7. Influence of the reaction temperature The reactivity results at different reaction temperatures are plotted in Fig. 6 for the 5 lo Co/CuLa2Zr20., catalysts.

Further the higher alcohol selectivity in the total alcohol production increases from 44 to 54 wt.-% as the temperature is raised from 250 to 270 C. 3.8. Addition of molybdenum The addition of only Mo on a CuLa2Zr207 catalyst does not lead to the formation of interesting amounts of higher alcohols. According to the mechanism given in Scheme 1 [ 12,14], Mo does not promote under our reaction conditions the formation of alkyl surface species by dissociative adsorption of CO. The addition of Mo to the CuLa2Zr207 catalyst ( as oxides) only results in a sharp drop of methanol production which is seven times lower than on the unpromoted one ( Table 4) . This phenomenum is similar to that observed above by the addition of cobalt and could possibly be explained by the covering of the active copper sites by a highly irreducible molybdenum oxide.

Influence of the reaction temperature on the reactivity of a Co/CuLa2Zr207 catalyst. Catalyst: 5% Co/50% Cu La2Zr207. Conditions: CO +2H2 gas flow 41 h-' Cat!, P=6 MPa. However, for the bimetallic Co/CuLa2Zr20, system, an important promotional effect has been observed by the addition of 3% Mo (Table 4). The alcohol yield is increased from 4.6 to 10.3% and the alcohol selectivity is also clearly improved. These results can be compared to those cited in the literature. Fujimoto and Oba [24] reported on MoCoK/Si02 an increase in alcohol yield from 0.4 to 2.6% and van den Berg et al. [ 22] claimed that for MoOx + Mn0-promoted rhodium catalysts the conversion increased from 2 to 6%. Meriaudeau et al. [ 25 ] reported also a beneficial effect of Mo addition on Pt/Si02. According to these last authors the change of the relative concentration of adsorbed CO and HZ could be related to the enhancement of the catalytic activity. It seems that the concentration of adsorbed hydrogen increases with the Mo content and therefore favors the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. Infrared data confirm the enhancement of hydrogen adsorption by MoOx addition [ 23,25 ] . 3.9. Influence of the Mo content Four catalysts with different Mo contents (1 to 5%) were prepared and tested in CO + HZ reactions and the results are compared in Fig. 6. It can be observed that the total activity of the catalytic system clearly increases upon Mo addition. The maximum alcohol yield (10.3% at 270 C) is obtained with a catalyst promoted by 3% Mo. The hydrocarbon and COZ yields show the same trend as that of the alcohols. The most active system contains 3% Mo and leads to 9.2% hydrocarbons and 4.8% C02- The alcohol selectivity is also maximum (52.8%) with the 3% Mo containing catalyst. A decrease of the proportion of higher alcohols in the total alcohol production is observed on Mo promoted catalysts and can be related to a higher increase in methanol formation. By promoting the Co/CuLa2Zr207 catalyst with 5% Mo, the methanol content of the alcohol phase increases from 48.4% to 68.4% W.

The alcohol distribution ( Fig. 3 ) also shows a higher methanol production than is expected from a linear ASF distribution. The alteration of the hydrogenating properties of the system can explain these results. The Mo addition enhances the catalytic activity by improving the hydrogenation activity of the system. However, it does not improve the chain growth probability since it favors the hydrogenation of the Ct inserting species to methanol. It does not permit the formation of alkyl species as given in Scheme 1. 3.10. Influence of the reaction temperature on the Mo promoted catalyst The production of alcohols increases steadily with temperature as observed also for copper and cobalt catalyts. However, the selectivity to alcohol decreases with rising reaction temperatures. The decrease of alcohol selectivity is specially important above 270 C where hydrocarbon production becomes predominant on all catalysts. 30 20 v > 10 250 260 270 280 Fig. 8.

It seems that the best compromise between alcohol production and alcohol selectivity can be obtained at a reaction temperature of 270 C. 3. 11. Promotional effect of other group VI metals The promotional effect of group VIb metal oxides on the Co/CuLazZr20, catalysts (Cr and W) is compared to the Mo promoted ones on Fig. 9. It can be seen that only Mo has a really positive effect on alcohol and hydrocarbon formation. 3.12. Promotional effect of other group VIII metal oxides Fe and Ni can be used instead of cobalt. Fe and Ni addition to the Mo/CuLa2Zr207 catalyst can also enhance the formation of C2+ alcohols. With respect to the total alcohol yield, it can be seen in Fig. 10 that it increases in the following sequence Fe < Co < Ni. The nickel-containing catalyst has in fact the highest yield but methanol is the more important part in the alcohol fraction and 20 32 m 10 - Fe Co Ni Promoters Fig. 10.

Relation between catalytic behavior and characterization 3.13.1. TPD of acetaldehyde The TPD of acetaldehyde has been used by Kiennemann et al. [ 12] to predict the alcohol chain-growth probability by relating it to the amount of desorbed acetone produced by the surface trapping of an acetyl surface species by CH3. According to the reaction scheme given by these authors three pathways for the transformation of chemisorbed acetaldehyde can be proposed to explain the TPD data of Fig. 11: 360-400 K desorption of acetaldehyde and/or ethanol, 420-450 K desorption of acetone: trapping of acetyl species, T > 630 K CO2, CH4, acetone: decomposition of surface carboxylates (formates and acetates). Comparing the data in Fig. 12, the acetone desorption between 150 and 200 C for the catalysts prepared in the present study, it can be observed that on Co and 80 P 60 '' _N ~ 1 C / 1 ~ '1 r 40 o Q 6 n4~ l' .: 20 i 0 _ r\" 0 100 200 300 T C Fig. 12.

Co + Mo promoted CuLa2Zr207 catalysts, the yield of higher alcohols can roughly be related to the amount of desorbed acetone (e.g. the formation of 16.9 and 41.9 A.U. of acetone corresponds respectively to 18.5 and 48.7 g of higher alcohols per g of catalyst and per hour). The previous relation [ 13] established between the alcohol chain-growth probability and the amount of low-temperature-desorbed acetone is not found. This can be explained from the fact that the catalysts in the present study are modified copper methanol catalysts whereas in the work of Kiennemann et al. the system is a Cu- promoted cobalt hydrocarbon producing catalyst. For our catalysts, the increase in higher alcohol yield is counterbalanced by a faster increase in methanol production. Further the ratio between desorbed ethanol and acetaldehyde can be considered as a measure of the hydrogenation activities of the catalysts. The decreased hydrogenation activities by addition of Co (Table 5) can be related to the decrease in methanol yield compared to the unpromoted copper catalyst. The higher activity of the MoOx promoted Co/CuLa2Zr0, system can also be related to an enhancement of hydrogenation power (as observed in Table 5) , in agreement with the discussion in the previous paragraph. 3.14. Addition of ethylene as a probe molecule The addition of probe molecules to the CO + HZ mixture can provide useful information on the chain-growth step of the reaction [ 12,13,26 ] . Ethylene addition to the CO + 2H2 mixture, after establishment of the steadystate at atmospheric pressure, leads to the effect shown in Fig. 13. An increase of propanal and propanol production, together with a drop in methanol formation, is obtained. This result is in agreement with a chain-growth step involving the insertion of a CI-oxygenated methanol precursor into hydrocarbonated entities which can be formed on the catalytic sites. Comparing the results obtained with the monometallic systems with that of the Cu-Co containing catalysts, it can be seen that the simultaneous presence of copper and cobalt is necessary to enhance the propanal + propanol formation (Fig. 14) . This result is in accordance with the literature which claims that copper and cobalt must both be present to have an improved chain-growth in alcohol synthesis. The positive effect of Mo is also clearly illustrated in Fig. 14.

Reaction conditions: see the Experimental section. Further the ethylene probe molecule experiments give an indication of the hydrogenation activities of the catalysts by the CZH6/CZH6+C2H4 ratio of the outlet gases. Thus 99% of the introduced ethylene is converted to ethane whereas only 20% is converted on the Co-promoted system. The results obtained in the probe molecule experiments and those in the TPD experiments after acetaldehyde adsorption are given in Table 6. 110 4V Chu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 121 (1995) 95-111 The enhancement of the hydrogenation power upon adding Mo to the Co/ CuLa2Zr207 catalyst is observed in TPD and in C2H4 probe molecule experiments. The increase in alcohol formation (seen in Table 4) is in good agreement with this result. 4. Conclusion Ct-C6 alcohols can efficiently be produced by promoting a typical methanol catalyst (e.g. CuLa2Zr207) by addition of cobalt and/or molybdenum compounds. An Anderson-Schulz-Flory type distribution is observed and mainly linear alcohols are formed. This excludes an aldolization mechanism. The alcohol distribution as well as the results of CZH4 probe molecule experiments and TPD after acetaldehyde adsorption are in good agreement with a mechanism of insertion of a Ct-oxygen containing species into an alkyl growing chain.

New catalysts based on Co- and Mo-promoted CuLa2Zr2O7 methanol synthesis catalysts were prepared. These catalysts showed good activities and selectivities in the synthesis of C1-C6 alcohols from a CO+H2 mixture. These alcohols have an Anderson-Schulz-Flory type distribution. The influence of promoters and reaction conditions on the reactivities were investigated and compared. Co favors the chain growing process, and in that respect, it is more effective than Fe or Ni whereas Mo enhances only the hydrogenating power of the catalyst and so increases the total conversion. In the knowledge of the reaction mechanism, TPD after acetaldehyde adsorption and probe molecules experiments gave strong evidence of the insertion of a C1 oxygen-containing species into an alkyl chain.
