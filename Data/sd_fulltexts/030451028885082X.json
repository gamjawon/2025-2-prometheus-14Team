These trans-/cis- ratios show a marked dependence on the nature of the support. An explanation is proposed in terms of specific support interactions. The effect of the precursors is also considered. Easily accessible inorganic chloro complexes such as potassium hexachlororhenate(IV), K^ReCle], and/or 'rhenium pentachloride' (see text), RezClio, are used to prepare bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts which catalyze both double bond isomerization and metathesis of 1-octene at room temperature. Activa- tion of the catalysts can be achieved by thermal treatments in nitrogen, the final temperature being in the range 300 - 360 C. Several chemical species of rhenium are evidenced by XPS analysis for the active catalysts. It should be emphasized that the XPS spectral differences between the catalysts prepared with K^ReCl,;] and those obtained with Re^Ciio on silica-alumina (75% SiO^) are correlated with the different catalytic reactivities. These novel rhenium catalysts can be modified to generate 'tailor-made catalysts'. Introduction 'ReO^/7-alumina' is one of the most efficient and selective heteroge- neous catalyst systems for olefin metathesis, [1, 2]. It can work at ordinary *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 38 temperature and under atmospheric pressure. The metathesis of func- tionalized olefins has been a goal ever since metathesis catalysts were first discovered, and much progress has been made, primarily with SnR4 activated tungsten or rhenium systems (R = alkyi) [3, 4]. The use of rhenium for metathesis was first proposed in 1964 by British Petroleum Ltd. [5], and although numerous studies and patents concern ammonium perrhenate precursors, the catalytic mechanism is not completely understood. Moreover, the catalyst preparation has not been thoroughly rationalized, and this situation could explain the different literature results; the exact nature of the active sites has always been an interesting subject and powerful analytical methods have been applied to its determination. Various effects related to support modifications are given in excellent books and reviews [1, 2, 6]. One of the interesting results is that the activity of silica-alumina (or alumina-boria) supported catalysts with very low ReO^ loadings is higher than that of the corresponding ReO^/J-Al^Oy catalysts for the metathesis of methyl oleate [7]. As far as the rhenium precursor is concerned, most of the systems relate to ammonium perrhenate NH4ReC>4 [1,2]; nevertheless several attempts have been made to utilize more exotic complexes such as rhenium carbonyl [8, 9] or ir-allyl complexes [10], which have been proposed for deposition on inorganic supports (7-alumina or silica) so that catalysts more active than the organometallic complexes themselves can be obtained [10]. Worth mentioning is the fact that few studies are apparently devoted to rhenium-chloro- or -chloroalkoxo complexes grafted on classical inorganic supports (alumina, silica, silica-aluminas, etc.), whereas several papers and patents are devoted to this type of catalyst with tungsten or molybdenum [1]. To improve the heterogeneous rhenium-based catalysts, it seemed interesting to consider what differentiates 7-alumina and different silica- aluminas in the metathesis reaction, and so exploit this 'support effect' to the maximum. To study these catalytic systems, methyl oleate metathesis has been chosen as one of the most demanding catalytic reactions. It is known that middle- (or high-)valent transition metal oxo- (or alkoxo-) halogenoalkylidene species certainly are important as active catalytic intermediates in metathesis reactions [11]. Indeed, the key role of such metal complexes containing both organic and oxo- (and halogeno-) groups has recently been pointed out [12]. These considerations led us to choose not too elaborate (nor too expensive) complexes, which can be grafted onto the supports previously considered to generate active species similar to those involved in homoge- neous systems, or related surface complexes. In this paper, we examine the results obtained with two rhenium-chloro complexes, potassium hexachloro- rhenate I^ReCle] and 'rhenium pentachloride' RezClio (or [ReCl^(OR)y] ). With these complexes very active metathesis catalysts are obtained, a result which could open the way to further studies for the preparation of bi- (or poly-) .functional rhenium catalysts. Preliminary results with these novel 39 catalysts showed that they also catalyze isomerization at room temperature. To simplify the GLC (and GLC-MS) analysis, we therefore chose 1-octene for the olefin metathesis test. We shall report briefly the preliminary results with the methyl oleate metathesis reaction. Results and discussion Methyl oleate metathesis with the 'ReO^isupport' precursors; 'support effect' measured by conversion and stereoselectiuity Little is known concerning the stereoselectivity of olefins produced by heterogeneous metathesis. The ci's-/frans-ratio depends markedly on the catalyst system and the extent of conversion. It can decrease rapidly with increasing conversion, and become almost constant at higher conversion, To evaluate the 'support effect', it is important therefore to determine the cis-/trans-ratios not only for productive metathesis but also for 'unproduc- tive metathesis', that is, the conversion of methyl oleate to methyl elaidate. Some data concerning inorganic supports; thermal treatments of catalyst precursors Three supports were considered: 7-alumina and silica-alumina with 25% or 75% SiO^. The main characteristics are given in Table 1 with the rhenium percentages.

The upper limit for the thermal treatment was 900 K. Methyl oleate metathesis The reaction considered corresponds to : 40 2CH3-(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOMe i=^ l CH3-(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7-CH3 2 + MeOCO-(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7-COOMe 3 Scheme 1. Initially 1 is the eis compound, and 'unproductive metathesis' gives methyl elaidate (trans compound). To compare the catalytic systems, Chro- matographie analysis was refined so that cis-/trans- ratios could be deter- mined for each product (1; 9-octadecene, 2, and dimethyl 9-octadecene- dioate, 3). Conversion vs. time curves: A GLC trace for the homometathesis of methyl oleate is reproduced in Fig. 1; from this chromatogram, the con- version can be calculated from the relation: CMl C-II Fig. 1.

Four 'ReO^/support' precursors were compared m this way: ReO^ (Re =: 7.1%) on 7-alumina; ReO^ supported on silica-alumina (Re content 2.2 and 4.5%), the silica content being 25%; silica-alumina (75% SiO^) with 2.1% Re (Table 1). Fig. 2. Conversion (%) of methyl oleate, 1, as a function of the reaction time, using ReOx precursors (curve numbers correspond to run numbers, see Table 1). Methyl oleate metathesis occurs at room temperature (20 C) but is more difficult than the metathesis reaction with unfunctionalized olefins. The operating conditions must be carefully controlled (see experimental section) and the oleate must be in a state of high purity (water, methanoi or free acid must be excluded). Moreover, the isenthalpic reaction does not go to equilibrium if the precursor is not properly activated (the conversion can stop at 20 - 30%). The addition of a cocatalyst (SnBu4 in this work) is absolutely essential for the in situ generation of the active species. Figure 2 gives the conversion (%) of methyl oleate 1 as a function of the reaction time, for different catalytic precursors used immediately after *0r S-( trans- )/S-(cis-) ratios; MS experiments are in progress to determine double bond migration. 42 activation, so as to avoid aging. Maximum yields are obtained after about 12 h whatever the catalyst. Silica-alumina-based systems (Fig. 2, curves 2, 3 and 4) are more efficient than the 7-alumina counterparts (Fig. 2, curves 1 and 1'). Nevertheless absolute comparison is difficult, since the supports have not only different acid-base character but also different initial specific surface areas and pore volumes (Table 1). Identical thermal treatments of the ReO^/silica-alumina lead to very nearly equal activities for the 25% and 75% SiO^ silica-aluminas (Fig. 2, curves 2 and 4). This result could raise some questions about the role of the Bronsted acidity, considered by many authors to be the predominant factor [4, 13]. Our results compare well with those recently claimed in a patent [14] which recommend the use of a high silica concentration (75.7% SiO^). Analysis of the stereoselectivity of the reaction: This part deals with the first results obtained with heterogeneous systems and with methyl oleate metathesis. Figures 3, 4 and 5 give the variations of the trans-lcis- ratios for the olefinic product, 2, the monoester (methyl elaidate/methyl oleate) and for the diester, 3, respectively. In contrast with observations concerning homo- geneous systems [15, 16], the starting ci's-olefinic product (methyl oleate) gives preferentially frans-9-octadecene, trans-2, and ^ans-dimethyl 9-octa- decenedioate, trans-3; these trans isomers are more abundant with the silica- alumina supports.

Trans-Slcis-3 vs. time. -/- time(h) metallacyclobutane intermediates [16] must be considered. We propose that the isomerization process can be partly governed by a non-carbenic species. It is perhaps significant that the conversion reaches nearly 90% 44 of its maximum after 12 h (Fig. 2), while at the same time the isomeriza- tion process is terminated with 7-alumina systems (Fig. 4, curves 1 and 1'), but continues with silica-aluminas (Fig. 4, curves 2, 3 and 4). All these differences concerning the stereo selectivity can be related to the relative acidity of the inorganic supports and/or to the environment of the catalytic site. According to Andreu et al., the Bronsted acidity is maximal for an A1203 content of almost 25% [17]. According to recent work [18], the catalytic activity for metathesis of methyl oleate is correlated with the Bronsted acidity of the precursors and not with the Lewis acidity. Our results (Figs. 2 - 5) can be explained by considering that the Bronsted acidity of 7-alumina (7.1% Re) is lower than that of the silica-aluminas with ReOx (2.1 - 2.2% Re). In fact, the curves (Fig. 4) concerning the isomerization process: cis-1 ^=^ trans-1 Scheme 2. are an indirect measure of the relative acidity of the support: silica-alumina (75 - 25%) > silica-alumina (25 - 75%) > 7-alumina. We believe that our results can be interpreted in terms of a cis-1 /trans-l transformation (Scheme 2) proceeding by two pathways: via carbonium ions or alkyi intermediates and via 'unproductive metathesis' (with rhenium carbene). We suggest also that protons donated from Bronsted acid sites may be involved in the formation and the stabilization of the initial carbene [19] first proposed by Herisson and Chauvin [20]. This conclusion indicates that surface complexes comparable to those which have recently been synthesized in tungsten chemistry (alkoxo- halogeno-carbenes, etc) [11] should be developed. By substituting rhenium- chloro complexes for ammonium perrhenate, we aim to synthesize 'true catalysts', in other words, systems which do not necessitate co-catalysts (SnR4, PbR4, etc.). This implies that Re(IV) or Re(V) chloro complexes [21] should be considered. The most accessible (and the least expensive) are K^Re^Cle] and Re^Cl^o. They are used to prepare novel catalysts. 1-Octene metathesis by the novel catalytic systems K^ReCl^ or [ReCl^- (OR)y} n/support, evidence for a precursor effect Since the understanding of this method concerns the properties of chloro complexes, they must be considered before the observations on the matrix-complex interactions (mainly for the silica-aluminas with 25 or 75% SiO^). Potassium hexachlororhenate(IV) and 'rhenium pentachloride' pre- cursors: preparation of the catalysts and characterization of the deposits K^[ReCl(,] on silica-alumina: Numerous very stable complexes of the type [ReXss]2\" are known [22]; they can replace [Re04]~ m a capillary impregnation process or 'dry impregnation'. Since alkaline promoters have 45 been proposed for heterogeneous metathesis catalysts [1, 23], potassium hexachlororhenate(IV) can be used for the impregnation process. Potassium hexachlororhenate(IV) is obtained by reduction of potas- sium perrhenate m hydrochloric acid solution. Yields exceed 90% when the reducing agent is hypophosphorous acid [24]. Although the aquation of [ReCIa]2\" in dilute acid is exceedingly slow (k = 9 X lO\"9 s~1 at 35 C) [25], we observed a silica-alumina catalyzed aquation of this anion which gives one or several unidentified species evidenced by the U V-visible spectra of the sample obtained by capillary impregnation (Fig. 6a, b). It is thus possible to minimize aquation during the dry impregnation process if high H 30\"'\" and Cl~ concentrations (0.2 mol dm~3 - 2 mol dm\"3) are used. The procedure based on the hexachloro complex has serious limitations, since this complex is easily hydrolyzed to form poorly defined products. Furthermore, the low pH required to maintain the integrity of the [ReCle]2\" complex can lead to alteration of the silica-alumina support. Re^CliQ or chloro-alkoxo rhenium complexes on silica-alumina: 'Rhe- nium pentachloride', m fact ReiClio can be easily prepared; it is the sole product of the chlorination of the metal and may also be obtained by heating Re;^ with CC^ [26]. It dissociates to Re3Cl9 and C^ when heated in a stream of inert gas [26, 27]. In the presence of small amounts of water, Re2Clio usually yields complexes of Rev with terminal oxygen such as [ReOClg]2\" [28,29]. Aquo- and hydroxo-complexes are undoubtedly formed as intermediates, since the Re=0 moiety can be reversibly pro- tonated to Re OH and Re OH^ [29, 30]. Alkoxo complexes such as ReO(OEt)X2L2 are well known [30, 31], but they are usually synthesized m ethanol by indirect methods. For an overview of rhenium-alkoxo complexes, see the papers of Wilkinson's group [32]. Preliminary experiments showed that anhydrous alcohol (especially EtOH) is one of the best solvents for impregnating inorganic supports with molecular rhenium chloro complexes. We have been unable to isolate alkoxide compounds starting with ReiClio, but have indirect evidence for the formation of chloro-alkoxo complexes if this compound is dissolved in an anhydrous alcohol. It is not necessary to isolate these complexes to prepare active metathesis catalysts. Thus, 'rhenium pentachloride' acts as an efficient catalyst at room temperature (20 C), promoting the isomerization of acid-sensitive substrates such as 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, 4, to 3-methyl-2-buten-l-ol, 5, in the absence of air and water: 4 5 Scheme 3. with subsequent formation of ethers 6 and 7 : 46- Fig. 6.

Scheme 4. 47 Reactions involving 4 (or 5) give the same products if they are catalyzed by rhenium or tungsten alkoxides such as 0=W(OC2Hg)4 or acids, for example HBF4, (CzHg^O [33]. In any case, we think that the products 5, 6 and 7 are indicative of the intermediate formation of rhenium chloro- alkoxo complexes, the active species being alkoxonium ion and/or [ReCLc- (OR)yL [33]. It is essential that the matrix material used for the impregnation be freed from adsorbed water, as this would merely react with and destroy the rhenium complex (vide supra). This can be achieved by, for example, a simple thermal treatment (KT2 torr at 200 C for 10 h). Then Re^Clio and anhydrous ethanol are introduced under anaerobic conditions (nitrogen atmosphere), the mixture is refluxed for 6 h and finally concentrated to give a uniform deposit of rhenium complex on the pellets. The reaction between the rhenium complex and the matrix material involves displacement of one or more of the alkoxy groups (or chloride) by the =Si 0 moieties, with liberation of the corresponding free alcohol (or HC1). The reaction may be represented by the following scheme: Matrix-(-OH) + [ReCL,(OR)y] > Matrix-0+ReCl^(OR)y - i] + ROH Scheme 5. where Matrix-f-OH) denotes 'bare Bronsted sites' such as: H H 0+ 0 Si \"Al\" .Si Al; Scheme 6. These deposits were examined by surface analysis techniques. BET determinations show that a part of the porous structure (r < 15 A) is blocked by the rhenium deposit (Fig. 7). X-ray powder diagrams show the formation of crystalline deposits with the K^ReCle] systems but not with the Re^Clio precursors at low Re percentages (<2%). Infrared absorption in the 915 - 995 cm~1 region indicates terminal Re 0 stretching in mono- oxo complexes and/or binuclear JU-OXO species; complete characterization will be published elsewhere [34]. The uniformity of X-ray amorphous deposits is best checked by electron scanning microscopy with energy disper- sive analysis of X-rays (EDS, emission lines ReLai, Lpi, L^ and Lyi). Local analysis of the relative percentages (Re/Si; Re/Ai) gives clear evidence for almost uniform deposits with [ReClx(OR)y] (ex. ReiClio) (Fig. 8).

One is similar to the treatment generally adopted with NH4Re04-precursors (vide supra and experimental section). It gives active catalysts with SnR4 adducts which are very efficient for methyl oleate metathesis. Typical curves obtained with such a precursor are similar to curve 4 (Fig. 2). More interesting would be a treatment which could maintain the formal oxidation number of the supported complex and keep part of the chlorine introduced with it. The presence of Cl modifies the strength and concentra- tion of acidic sites on 7-A12U3 and SiO^-A^f^ [35]. True homogeneous catalysts for metathesis are often chloro complexes of transition metals [11]. Recent work shows clearly that the formal oxidation numbers of such complexes lie between the extremes; for example W^ in the case of tungsten [11]. Accordingly, we treated the rhenium deposits in a nitrogen atmo- sphere, the final temperature in the range 300 - 360 C being chosen to retain a part of the initial chlorine and to increase the Bronsted acidity [36]. Conductimetric titration was used instead of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to follow the chloride evolution (HC1 and/or Cl;) during the tempera- ture-programmed treatment (=120 K h~1) of the chlorinated rhenium precursors. (TGA is inconvenient in our case because of simultaneous dechlorination and dehydration, especially with the I^ReClg] systems.) Figure 9 shows typical dechlorination curves. They give clear evidence for the sensitivity of the method, which makes it possible to detect the initial Fig. 9.

These changes are certainly related to partial aquation of the anion during the impregnation step {vide supra). The degree of dechlorination can be chosen for the catalysts used in the catalytic tests (Table 2 and XPS results). 1-Octene metathesis: a comparative study of the ReClx/silica-alumina systems. The following parameters were kept constant: [Re]/[olefin] =: 1/100; chlorobenzene as solvent; room temperature (^20 C); time: 24 h. Table 2 summarizes the results of 1-octene tests with different catalysts. Typical GLC analysis of octenes and metathesis products are reproduced m Figs. 10 and 11 (24-h runs). There are marked differences between catalyst 6 (K^ReCle] precursor on silica-alumina (75% SiOi)), and catalyst 7 ([ReCL,(OR)y] precursor with the same support). GLC-MS couplings show that branched olefins are formed under the mild conditions employed, but they are minor products. Nevertheless, they indicate that the catalyst is highly acidic. More than 20% of the liquid olefins are formed in the Cc - Cig range. All catalysts (runs 5 -8, Table 2) show different isomerization activities probably attributable to differences in the active sites of the TABLE 2 Composition of products of metathesis runs Run numbers ga Qb 70 gd % Cl 0 0.5 0.65 0.5 %Re 7.5 1.5-2.0 1.75-2.25 1.75-2.25 Composition of the liquid phase (%) wl'Lw Cs-C^C7-Cs-C9\\ GIOCn-Cl2-Cl3; 0(4Cis\" alkylation products 1 28 2.5 0.5 3.5 2 1 60 0.5 0 2 3 8.5 23 8.5 5 6 11 16 10.5 <! traces 1.5 3 3 4 5.25 8 55.5 34 5.25 8 5.0 7 5.0 7.5 4.0 10 1.0 7.75 0.75 213.5 6 [ Re ]/[ 1-octene] =; 1/100; chlorobenzene as solvent; room temperature (20 C);time 24 h except*1 4h; ReO^'y-Al^; ''K^ReClg] precursor on silica-alumina (75% SiO^); c[ReCl (OR)y]n/sil-al(75%/Si02); ^ReCL^OR^ln/sil-al (25% SiOz). 52 U u\" U Fig. 10.

The 'ReCLJsilica-alumina' systems (runs 6 - 8, Table 2) also promote alkylation of the chlorobenzene (solvent) to form derivatives such as: Scheme 7. These are minor products (Kn<6; 3<m<5); but the catalyst derived from Re2Clio and silica-alumina (75% SiO;) gives 5 - 14% of such products (n = 7; m = 6) in the early stage of the process (see Fig. 11). 'Rhenium pentachloride' has been found to be a Lewis acid which acts as a mild but efficient catalyst for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acyla- 53 tion of aromatic rings. It also catalyzes the oligomerization of olefins and acetylenes [37]. Note that in this work, the Priedel-Crafts reaction has been conducted with ethylene and benzene at 75 C and ethylene at 47 kg cm\"2, and that it is usually more difficult to alkylate monochlorobenzene than benzene. Our bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts catalyse both double bond isomerization and metathesis at room temperature. They could be suitable for metathetic oligomerisation, 'metol reaction', the major alkenes obtained resulting from different concomitant processes: +C3-C=C-C3 p C3-C=C-C3 , > 3 ^ + tj-Ca (homometathesis) f; r; r'_P Cg\" Cg\" + C3 C=C C3 C2 C=C C4 ( ) ^\"\"\"^ + C\"\"^ (cometathesis) ,-, A ss, ^ v^3 \\-' 0 1-/3 CT\" C9= + C3 C=C C3 C-C=C-Cs < == u\"0 + C-us (cometathesis) p _.11, .1!,_p 3 ^ ^ -'3 Cfi\" Cio~ Scheme 8. The results of run 8 (Table 2) are very similar to those of run 6, though the support and the rhenium precursors are different, only the thermal treatments (nitrogen atmosphere, l h, 340 C) being the same. These results, whatever the explanation of catalytic activity, prove that these heteroge- neous catalysts can be modified by varying the support or the precursor. Methyl oleate homometathesis with the Red set silica-alumina catalysts: GLC analysis shows that without cocatalyst, the predominant reaction is still the isomerization: cis-1 4- > trans-products We must, therefore, modify one or several key-steps of these multi-parameter catalyst preparations before metathesis is the principal reaction. Work is m progress in our laboratory. Preliminary XPS results The Re4f spectra of KatReCle] (powder) and KztReCIo] on chlorinated alumina (or on silica-alumina 75% SiO^) appear in Fig. 12a and b. The binding energies (4f7/2 line) are 43.9 and 43.7 eV, respectively. 54 Binding 6nrg; |V Fig. 12.

The relative concentrations of K, Cl and Re are also similar, since the K 2p3/2/Re 4f7/2 and Cl 2p3/2/Re 4f7/2 area ratios are unchanged. These results show that K^ReCI^] does not undergo chemical changes on these supports (impregnation with aqueous solution, HaO^Cr: 2 mol dm\"3). After thermal treatment (Fig. 12c), two types of Re are present (Re 4f7/2 binding energies = 41.6 and 46.0 eV). Due to the uncertainties involved in the calibration of the spectra (see Experimental) and to possible variations of the binding energies when the environment of these analyzed atoms is modified, the assignment of these lines to particular Re oxidation states [38] is difficult. With the silica-alumina support (75% SiO;), I^ReCIo] can undergo chemical changes (aquation, vide supra) leading to the presence of at least three different types of Re (Fig. 13), when the aquation processes of [ReCle]2\" develop (low H30+C^ concentrations, pH = 1). This ties in with the UV-visible spectra of Fig. 6a. Similarly, 'rhenium pentachloride' or [ReClx(OR)y] on the same support gives rise to two types of Re signal (Fig. 14a) with Re 4f7/2 binding energies of 42.2 and 44.8 eV. The Re 4f7/2 (total of the two forms)/Cl 2p3/2 area ratio is close to 8, whereas its value is 0.67 in the case of K^ReCle]. This difference in chlorine content is in agreement with the proposed scheme (vide supra and Scheme 5). After thermal treatment, two types of Re are again observed (Fig. 14b) with Re 4f7/2 binding energies of 41.8 and 45.2 eV. The Cl 2p3/2 line is no longer observed. It is worth noting that the Re 4f spectra are however not dramatically changed. These results show that in the active forms of the catalysts, at least two types of Re centre are systematically observed. We suggest that the reactivity changes between the catalysts might be due to population and/or chemical nature variations of the two (or more) observed surface species. Further work is currently in progress to identify these different chemical forms. Conclusion It has proved possible to develop bifunctional heterogenous catalysts for metathetic oligomerisation of olefins. They can be generated by the classical NH4Re04/support system as many authors have shown, but also by easily synthesized inorganic chloro complexes such as potassium hexachloro- rhenate(IV) and/or 'rhenium pentachloride'. Work continues with not too elaborate (nor too expensive) complexes in our laboratory to create 'tailor- made catalysts'.

If the desired percentage (Re content) was higher than 2.5%, several dry impregnation steps were necessary, for example three steps with NH4Re04 for a theoretical Re content of 7.5%. 57 43.S8 .M Bind l n!)

Grafting of [ReCly(OEt)y}n onto dehydrated silica-alumina Grafting was performed with Re^Clio in anhydrous ethanol in strict absence of air and water. The mixture was refluxed for 6 h and finally concentrated to give a uniform deposit of rhenium complex(es) on the extruded material. 58 Drying and thermal treatment After each dry impregnation step, the precursor was dried under vacuum (10~2 torr; 12 h; 140 C with NH4Re04 systems or 200 C with KzlReCle] deposits). ReO;J support systems resulted from thermal treatment (under O;: 1 cm3 s~1; 120 K h\"1; 6 h at 900 K; cooling under N;). ReCl;J support catalysts were obtained by thermal treatment under nitrogen: 1 cm3 s~1; 120 K h\"1; 1 or 2 h at 570 - 630 K; cooling under N2. Chemical analysis of rhenium Rhenium analysis was performed by plasma absorption spectrometry. After grinding, the solid sample was submitted to a [2804 + HNOs mixture (7-A1203 deposits) or to H2SC>4 + HN03 + HF mixtures in a Teflon-lined bomb (silica-alumina catalysts). Homometathesis of methyl oleate The reactions with ReO^/support precursors were usually carried out in Schlenk vessels, under a controlled atmosphere (N2 or Ar), the reagents being introduced in the order: solid precursor (0.2 g); chlorobenzene (2 cm3); SnBu4 (6 ssl); finally after a 15 min delay, methyl oleate 0.2 - 0.4 cm3. The products were analyzed with a CP SIL 88 (50 m) capillary column. The identification of peaks was accomplished by comparison of retention times with authentic samples and by GLC-MS analysis. Mass spectral data were obtained at 70 eV using a mass spectrometer (Kratos MS 50) coupled with a DS 55 data system and GC apparatus (Pye Unicam). Metathesis with Red ^ I silica-alumina catalysts 1-Octene was isomerized and metathesized in a static system over a ReCLJsupport thermally treated. Approximately 0.4 g of catalyst was transferred under N2 to a reaction flask. The flask was capped with a rubber septum through which a hypodermic syringe was inserted to permit intro- duction of degassed chlorobenzene (2 cm3). Approximately 0.2-1.5 cm3 of nitrogen-purged olefin was then added. The flask was maintained at room temperature with gentle vibration. Periodic GLC analyses showed that equilibrium was generally reached in 12-24 h. The total products were analyzed on a Delsi gas Chromatograph using a 50 m OV1701 capillary column and FID detector. Chloride evolution HC1 (or 012) evolution measurements were made conductimetrically with a previously described system [39]. The sensitivity of detection by conductivity can reach 0.1% of the total chloride content of the samples. XPS measurements The XPS spectra were obtained with a VG Escalab MK1 spectrometer using Al Ka and Mg Ka X-rays. In order to avoid possible X-ray-induced modifications of the samples, the power applied to the anodes was kept low 59 (45 to 90 W). Higher powers were necessary (400 W) in order to obtain correct signals only with low Re content samples. This resulted in slight color changes in the case of K^ReClel/silica-alumina catalysts (dry impregnation with low P^cy'cr concentration; pH ^ 1.2). The pressure during the experiments was in the 10~7 torr range. The analyzer was operated in the constant energy mode (pass energy: 20 eV). The spectra were first summed 6 to 9 times, then smoothed and recon- structed with gaussian components. The Re 4f line was synthesized with doublets separated by 2.0 to 2.5 eV with an intensity ratio of 4:3 between the 7/2 and the 5/2 components [38b]. The binding energy scale was calibrated with the Al 2p line (74.7 eV) [38a] (except in the case of K^ReCle] where the contamination carbon CIs line at 285.0 eV was used). This energy referencing technique is not of universal applicability [40], so that some binding energy shifts may be due to variations of the Al 2p energy rather than to chemical changes.

These trans-/cis- ratios show a marked dependence on the nature of the support. An explanation is proposed in terms of specific support interactions. The effect of the precursors is also considered. Easily accessible inorganic chloro complexes such as potassium hexachlororhenate(IV), K2ReCl6], and/or lsrhenium pentachloriders (see text), Re2Cl10, are used to prepare bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts which catalyze both double bond isomerization and metathesis of 1-octene at room temperature. Activation of the catalysts can be achieved by thermal treatments in nitrogen, the final temperature being in the range 300–360°C. Several chemical species of rhenium are evidenced by XPS analysis for the active catalysts. It should be emphasized that the XPS spectral differences between the catalysts prepared with K2[ReCl6] and those obtained with Re2Cl10 on silica-alumina (75% SiO2) are correlated with the different catalytic reactivities. These novel rhenium catalysts can be modified to generate ‘tailor-made catalysts’. References 1 V. Dragutan A.T. Balaban M.

        "dc:description": "The trans-/cis- ratios in 9-octadecene, 2, monoester, 1, and dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate, 3, produced in the metathesis of methyl oleate, cis-1, are measured against time for a series of rhenium-supported precursors (ReO x /γ-alumina or ReO x /silica-alumina 25% SiO2 and 75% SiO2). These trans-/cis- ratios show a marked dependence on the nature of the support. An explanation is proposed in terms of specific support interactions. The effect of the precursors is also considered. Easily accessible inorganic chloro complexes such as potassium hexachlororhenate(IV), K2ReCl6], and/or lsrhenium pentachloriders (see text), Re2Cl10, are used to prepare bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts which catalyze both double bond isomerization and metathesis of 1-octene at room temperature. Activation of the catalysts can be achieved by thermal treatments in nitrogen, the final temperature being in the range 300–360°C. Several chemical species of rhenium are evidenced by XPS analysis for the active catalysts. It should be emphasized that the XPS spectral differences between the catalysts prepared with K2[ReCl6] and those obtained with Re2Cl10 on silica-alumina (75% SiO2) are correlated with the different catalytic reactivities. These novel rhenium catalysts can be modified to generate ‘tailor-made catalysts’.",
