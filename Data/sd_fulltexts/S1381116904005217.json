Aspects of preparation, such as ZrO2 precursor, sulfur contents, sulfating agent, and calcination conditions, were studied. The pure supports and catalysts were characterized with XRD, BET, FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy (pyridine adsorption), NH3-TPD, and tested for the benzoylation of anisole with benzoyl chloride.

Keywords Supported sulfated zirconia Acidity Properties 1 Introduction Sulfated zirconia (SZ) has been of interest for some time as a catalyst in the acylation of aromatics [1], a reaction normally catalyzed by superacids or Lewis acids [2]. Sulfated zirconia provides a catalyst that is solid and easier-to-handle than the corrosive, liquid acids usually used. This environmentally friendly catalyst is an alternative to the stoichiometric amounts of Lewis acids normally needed to “catalyze” this reaction, which result in high amounts of byproducts. Until now, most research has been done on bulk SZ prepared by the sulfation of precipitated zirconium hydroxide with or without metallate promotion [3]. To reduce costs, improve surface properties, and find a mechanically stable form of sulfated zirconia suitable for large-scale industrial processes, the possibility of supporting SZ is being studied. Common supports for SZ found in the literature are SiO2 [4–6], γ-Al2O3 [5,6], and the zeolite, FSM [7]. Pt promotion of sulfated zirconia supported by SiO2 or γ-Al2O3 has also been examined [8]. The catalytic activity of these supported catalysts has been studied for the following reactions: n-octane hydroisomerization [8], etherification [4], hexane conversion [5], 1-butene isomerization [7], and n-butane isomerization [6]. In [7], the FSM-supported SZ (SZ/FSM) catalyst was catalytically inactive for the benzoylation of toluene with both benzoyl chloride and benzoic acid anhydride. This was attributed to the low acidity of the supported catalyst, not the pore size [7]. However, results for Mukaiyama aldol condensation were comparable for SZ and SZ/FSM indicating a sufficient amount of strong acid sites in the supported catalyst for this reaction [7]. We studied the preparation, physical surface properties, surface acidity, and catalytic activity of SZ catalysts supported by SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and K-10. The catalytic activity was screened by the benzoylation of anisole with benzoyl chloride. The pure supports, SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and K-10, and the supported SZ catalysts were examined. Aspects of preparation, i.e., ZrO2 precursor and consequent synthesis, sulfur contents, sulfating agent, were varied and are discussed. In this paper, we report on the properties of selected supported SZ catalysts and their catalytic activities for the benzoylation of anisole. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Supported SZ catalysts were prepared by varying such factors as the ZrO2 precursor, the sulfating agent and sulfur contents, the support, and calcination conditions. An overview of the preparation is given in Table 1 . Sample notation indicates the support (Al for Al2O3, Si for SiO2, and K for K-10), the ZrO2 precursor (zirconyl chloride was used unless otherwise indicated with S for zirconium sulfate or N for zirconium nitrate), and when applicable, oven drying (od) or freeze drying (fd) procedures, respectively, for SZ/Al samples; the sulfur contents is given in parenthesis at the end of the sample code, for example, SZ/Al-fd(2.2) is a freeze-dried, Al2O3-supported SZ with an experimental sulfur contents of 2.3wt.% S and zirconyl chloride as the precursor, or SZ/Si-1(2.3), a SiO2-supported SZ sample with 2.3wt.% S prepared from the ZrO2 precursor, zirconyl chloride. In the case of the chloride or nitrate and complete evaporation of the solvent, the theoretical wt.% ZrO2 was calculated from the amount of the ZrO2 precursor used during synthesis. When the excess precursor solution was filtered off, the wt.% of ZrO2 was calculated from the volume of precursor solution adsorbed by the support. In the case of Zr(SO4)2·2H2O, the wt.% ZrO2 was calculated from the elemental sulfur contents of the sample prior to calcination. 2.2 Variation of support The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, SZ/Al-od(2.2) and SZ/Al-fd(2.2), were prepared by impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (Leuna Werk) with an aqueous solution of 5M ZrOCl2·8H2O (Fluka, 99%) and 2.2M (NH4)2SO4 (Isocommerz, p.a.). The soaked support was then exposed to flowing NH3 gas. The samples were then oven-dried at 100°C [SZ/Al-od(2.2)] or freeze-dried [SZ/Al-fd(2.2)] followed by calcination at 550°C in Ar. The preparation of SZ/Si-1(2.3), a SiO2-supported catalyst, involved soaking the SiO2 support (Alfa Aesar, wide pore, 150Å) in an aqueous 0.6M solution of ZrOCl2·8H2O. After complete evaporation, the sample was freeze-dried. NH3 gas was then flowed over the freeze-dried sample for 1h prior to further drying at 100°C. The sample was then sulfated by impregnation with 1M H2SO4 and calcined at 550°C in Ar. The Montmorillonite K-10 (Aldrich) supported catalysts, SZ/K-2(2.0) and -2a(3.9), were synthesized similarly to SZ/Si-1(2.3). Instead of freeze drying, the excess aqueous 1M ZrOCl2·8H2O solution was filtered off after impregnation of the support. The sample was then exposed to NH3, sulfated with 1M H2SO4, and dried at 60°C followed by calcination at 600°C in air. 2.3 Variation of sulfur contents The influence of the sulfur contents on the catalytic activity was studied with a series of SZ/Si-2 and SZ/Al-2 samples (Table 1). These samples were all prepared with respective amounts of ZrOCl2·8H2O and 1M H2SO4 to yield SZ (17wt.% ZrO2 and 1–5wt.% S) on SiO2 or γ-Al2O3. The steps of synthesis were identical to that of the SZ/K-2(2.0) samples. 2.4 Variation of ZrO2 precursor In the case of SZ/Si-N(2.6), the support, SiO2, was soaked in an aqueous 0.7M solution of zirconium nitrate (Reakhim, pure). The excess water was evaporated off and the sample was dried overnight. The sample was then precalcined at 300°C to decompose the nitrate. Final calcination was carried out under the same conditions described for the SZ/Si-2 samples after impregnation with 1M H2SO4. Zirconium sulfate hydrate (Aldrich, 99.99%) was also used as a ZrO2 precursor. The samples, SZ/Si-S, SZ/K-S(1.5), -Sa(2.0), and -Sb(1.7), and were prepared by simply soaking the supports, K-10 and SiO2, respectively, in an aqueous 1M solution of zirconium sulfate hydrate. The samples were then calcined at 700°C in air after drying for 12h at 120°C. 2.5 Catalyst characterization The concentrations of the elements, Si and Zr, in SZ/Si samples were measured with a Unichem 701 ICP atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), which was calibrated before each use with standard solutions. The ICP-AES results of the samples measured (indicated by * in Table 1) show that theoretical and experimental loadings of ZrO2 agree to within 2%, i.e., 20 and 22wt.% ZrO2, respectively, for SZ/Si-N(2.6). The sulfur contents of the samples were determined by standard elemental analysis with a Leco CHNS-932 analyzer and VTF 900 extension. The XRD patterns of the supports and supported catalysts were recorded on a RD 7 Seiffert-FPM diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, Ni-filter, 2θ = 5–64°, 0.050 step, 5s/step). Low temperature nitrogen adsorption experiments were carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 at 77K with N2 to determine the specific BET surface areas (S BET), the pore dimensions (V P and D P), and pore size distributions. The total concentration of acid sites of the sample was measured quantitatively by NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). NH3 was adsorbed in excess at 120°C on the sample in flowing Ar after sample pretreatment at 500°C for 1h under Ar. After flushing the sample with Ar, NH3-TPD was measured between 80 and 500°C at 10°C/min holding at 80°C for 1min and 500°C for 30min. NH3 desorption was detected by monitoring the NH3 band at 930 ± 5cm−1 with a Perkin-Elmer FTIR system 2000 spectrometer. The total NH3 desorbed was then quantitatively determined by reaction with excess sulfuric acid and back titration with NaOH. The type of acid sites (Lewis, L, or Brønsted, B) present in the supported catalysts was studied with FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) of chemisorbed pyridine adsorbate complexes (PACs). The measurements were carried out before and after pyridine adsorption between 400 and 4000cm−1 in a MTEC 300-photoacoustic cell on the IR spectrometer described above. The sample (pretreated at 150°C for 30min under Ar) was exposed to pyridine (2× 30μL) at 150°C with Ar flushing in between for 15min. The normalization of the spectra is described in [1]. Benzoylation of anisole with benzoyl chloride was carried out at 60°C for 3h under flowing N2 in a three-neck, round bottom flask with reflux condenser. Benzoyl chloride (373mg, 2.65mmol, Fluka, 99.5%), n-tridecane (GC-internal standard, approx. 60mg, 0.3mmol, Fluka, 99.5%), and anisole (11.7g, 108mmol, Fluka, 99%) were stirred together and heated to 60°C. The catalyst (200mg) was then added to the mixture after pretreatment at 200°C for 1h. Samples (0.3μL) of the reaction mixture were taken before and after reaction and analyzed gas chromatographically by a Varian 3400 GC with a wide bore column DB5 (J & W Scientific, USA) (length 15m, inner diameter 0.53mm) with FID: 340°C, injector: 320°C, temperature program: 120°C (3min) to 220°C (2min) at a heating rate of 20°C/min. Catalytic results were based on the conversion of benzoyl chloride, the total yield of 2- and 4-methoxybenzophenone, and the selectivity of these products. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD and physical surface properties The XRD patterns of the supports and supported catalysts in Fig. 1a–f show only broad, weak peaks for amorphous phases. The patterns of SZ/K-2(2.0) and pure K-10 (Fig. 1g and h, respectively), on the other hand, do show some phase crystallinity and sharper peaks for K-10. In the pattern of γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 1d), broad peaks are observed at about 40° and 45°, which decrease in intensity (45°) or disappear entirely (40°) when the support is loaded. Damyanova et al. attributed this to the interaction of ZrO2 with the support and the covering of alumina with ZrO2 crystallites [9]. Weak peaks confirm the presence of these crystallites at 30° and 50° (Fig. 1a and b) for ZrO2 [10]. No such peaks were observed in the pattern of SZ/Al-2d(3.3) (Fig. 1c) due to its lower ZrO2 loading of 17%. Nonetheless, the characteristic peaks for γ-Al2O3 decrease in intensity for this sample probably based on partial reaction of γ-Al2O3 with the sulfating agent, H2SO4. The XRD pattern of the SiO2 support (Fig. 1f) shows a broad peak between 15° and 30°, which broadens and losses intensity after SZ loading (Fig. 1e). No peaks are observed for tetragonal ZrO2, which indicates a good dispersion of the lower loading of the ZrO2 phase (17wt.% instead of 28wt.%). The samples, SZ/K10-2(2.0) and K-10, show a higher crystallinity than the others, yet similar to the γ-Al2O3-supported samples, the peaks of K-10 (Fig. 1h) decrease in intensity significantly, when K-10 is modified with SZ (Fig. 1g). Again, no peaks were observed for the ZrO2 phase with a loading less than 20wt.%. The surface area (S BET), total pore volume (V P), and average pore diameter (D P) of the SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and K-10 supports and selected supported catalysts are given in Table 2 . The surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the SiO2 and γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts are, as expected, much higher than that of the bulk catalyst [11], but the porosity is slightly lower than that of the SZ aerogel [12]. The K-10-supported catalysts have much lower surface areas and pore volumes than that of pure K-10 and the SiO2 and γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts. The average pore diameters of the SZ/K samples are 65 and 71Å, both higher than that of the K-10 support. The decrease in S BET and V P of the loaded supports (Table 2) indicates a complete filling of some of the pores by the SZ component preventing N2 adsorption in the filled pores [13]. The pore size distribution curves (Fig. 2 ) confirm this by showing an intensity decrease without a pore diameter shift of the maxima at 40, 100, and 110Å for K-10, γ-Al2O3, and SiO2, respectively. In [6], the pore size distribution curves did show a shift to lower pore diameters when the support was loaded, indicating, in comparison to here, not only a complete filling of some of the pores, but also partial filling of the other pores. 3.2 Surface acid properties The surface acid properties of the supports and selected supported SZ samples were characterized with NH3-TPD and FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy of pyridine adsorbate complexes (PACs) on the surface of the catalysts. The FTIR photoacoustic spectra and NH3 profiles from the NH3-TPD measurements of selected samples are compared in Figs. 3 and 4 . The semiquantitative intensities of the bands at approx. 1450, 1490, and 1550cm−1 in the IR spectra and the total concentration and density of acid sites measured by the amount of NH3 desorbed during NH3-TPD are all given in Table 2. In Fig. 3a, the spectra of PACs on the surface of the supports show that SiO2 has no surface acid sites (no bands observed), whereas a weak band at about 1450cm−1 indicates the presence of Lewis acid sites in γ-Al2O3. The support, K-10, in comparison, has both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites; all three bands are present in the spectrum (Fig. 3a). Loading of SZ on to SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 3b) increases the number of Lewis acid sites indicated by strong bands at about 1450 and 1490cm−1 [SZ/Si-1(2.3) and SZ/Al-od(2.2)]. In the case of SZ/Si-1(2.3), the band at 1450cm−1 is shifted to 1446cm−1 for weaker acid sites. Brønsted acid sites are also indicated in this sample by the weak, broad band at about 1550cm−1. SZ/Al-od(2.2) has few or no Brønsted acid sites and only a few Lewis acid sites (Fig. 3b and Table 2). The loading of ZrO2 on the Al2O3 and SiO2 supports described in [9] generated new Lewis and weaker Brønsted acid sites in ZrO2/SiO2 similar to the results presented here. In comparison, the increased loading of ZrO2 on Al2O3 reduced the number of total and strong Lewis acid sites [9]. This effect was not studied here. Nonetheless, it seems that little or no change in acidity is observed, when the supported ZrO2 phase is sulfated in contrast to the sulfation of bulk ZrO2 [1]. Acidic strength measurements on SZ/MCM-41 and SZ presented in [13] showed that the supported SZ phase had a lower acidic strength than the bulk material, but that it was ascribed as “superacidic”. In general, the band at 1490cm−1 can be assigned to PACs bonded to both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. When Lewis acid sites are exclusively present in the sample, the 1490cm−1 band intensity is one-third that of the 1450cm−1 band. In the spectra of SZ/K-2a(3.9) (Fig. 3b), the band at 1490cm−1 is comparable in intensity to that in the SZ/Si-1(2.3) and SZ/Al-od(2.2) spectra, yet the band observed at 1450cm−1 is much weaker in intensity and shifted to 1446cm−1. Therefore, the intensity of the band at 1490cm−1 can be attributed to Brønsted acid sites in SZ/K-2a(3.9) also indicated by a broad band between 1520 and 1560cm−1. These Brønsted acid sites could explain the improved catalytic yields of the SZ/K catalysts (Table 3 ) and originate directly from the support. The presence of Brønsted acid sites in K-10 and a decrease in these sites with SZ loading [14] [compare Fig. 3a and b: K-10 and SZ/K-2a(3.9)] is also indicated. The TPD measurements (Table 2 and Fig. 4a–c) show similar results. Here, the total concentration of acid sites of K-10 decreases significantly from 288 to <200μmol/g, when K-10 is loaded with SZ. The corresponding surface density of acid sites, however, increases from 1.03 to 1.87μmol/m2. The total number of acid sites of SZ/K-Sa(2.0) and K-10 correlate with their PAC IR band intensity values (Table 2). Pure K-10 also exhibits delayed desorption during isothermal conditions at 500°C, which was reduced when the support was loaded (compare Fig. 4a and b: dashed lines). NH3-TPD also confirms the lack of acid sites in SiO2 by an almost negligible amount of NH3 desorbed (3μmol/g, Table 2) and no significant maximum in the NH3 profile (Fig. 4a: dotted line). In the case of γ-Al2O3, it is more complicated. NH3 is desorbed from γ-Al2O3 from about 175 to 500°C. Desorption continues on at isothermal conditions (500°C for about 30min), but only a small amount of Lewis acid sites are present in γ-Al2O3 (Fig. 3a). Thus, the NH3 gas adsorption of γ-Al2O3 seems to be independent of its acid sites, which is also the case for CaO [15]. Interestingly enough, the SZ/Si samples had the highest concentrations of acid sites (279–390μmol/g, Table 2 and Fig. 4b). This is a direct result of the SZ loading and can be attributed to Lewis acid sites. The other samples, SZ/Al and SZ/K, have lower concentrations of acid sites (<300μmol/g) and different NH3 profiles. The profiles of SZ/Si and SZ/Al have rounded maxima between 200 and 300°C, with an abrupt decrease at 300°C for SZ/Al, yet the desorption of NH3 on SZ/Al above 300°C is much more gradual than that of SZ/Si, which has predominantly weaker Lewis acid sites. In the case of SZ/K, desorption of NH3 begins at a slightly higher temperature (about 175°C). A very broad, flat maximum is observed between 250 and 375°C indicating an even distribution of moderate acid sites in this temperature range. The shape of the NH3-TPD profile for SZ/K-2a(3.9) is very similar to that of the K-10 support. In the case of SZ/Si, the sulfur contents also influences the total concentration of acid sites of the samples, but not their strengths. Variations in the FTIR photoacoustic spectra of PACs (Fig. 3c) are also observed for the SZ/Si samples: SZ/Si-2a(1.2), SZ/Si-1(2.3), and SZ/Si-2e(3.2). Interestingly enough, the intensity of the band at about 1490cm-1 remains almost constant, independent of the sulfur contents. On the other hand, drastic changes are observed in the amount of Lewis acid sites (band at about 1450cm−1). SZ/Si-1(2.3) has the highest amount of Lewis acid sites. Sulfur contents of 1.2 and 3.2wt.% result in a lower amount of Lewis acid sites. The bands at around 1550cm−1 for Brønsted acid sites are broad and difficult to interpret; however, a slight trend to higher intensities with sulfur contents can be seen (Table 2 and Fig. 3c). This could explain why only slight variations are observed in the catalytic yields and no direct correlation with acidity can be made. TPD measurements show a direct correlation of the total concentration of acid sites and their surface density with S contents (Table 2): 390/1.59 for SZ/Si-2a(1.2), 359/1.50 for SZ/Si-1(2.3), and 308μmol/g/1.47μmol/m2 for SZ/Si-2e(3.2). The number of acid sites and their density is indirectly proportional to S contents. Fig. 4c shows similar profiles for all three samples with desorption starting at about 125°C. The profiles of the samples with 2.3 and 1.2wt.% S are almost identical except for the slightly higher intensity of the curve of the sample with 1.2wt.% S and a slight shift of the maximum to higher temperatures. On the other hand, the profile of SZ/SiO2-2e (3.2wt.% S) is much lower in intensity, has a broader maximum between 200 and 350°C, and desorbs NH3 more gradually between 300 and 500°C than the other two samples. This indicates the presence of stronger acid sites. 3.3 Catalysis and synthesis Catalytic results of the benzoylation of anisole with benzoyl chloride are presented in Table 3. The supported SZ samples vary from being inactive to having higher yields than that of bulk SZ (catalytic yield: 21% [11]) in the benzoylation of anisole. 3.4 Support and preparation methods The support seems to have a significant effect on the activity of the supported SZ sample. Catalytic yields of SZ/Al samples are very low between 0 and 7.0%. The freeze-dried sample, SZ/Al-fd(2.2), has a catalytic activity lower than that of the oven-dried sample, SZ/Al-od(2.2) (Table 3); therefore, most of the samples were simply oven-dried. SZ/Si samples achieve yields of 4.0–10.0%. The highest catalytic activities, however, are observed for SZ/K samples, which are, to some extent, even higher than that of bulk SZ (>21%). The improved activity of the SZ/K samples compared with that of SZ/Si and SZ/Al could be attributed to the added acid sites of the K-10 support observed by FTIR-PAS and NH3-TPD. Another indication of this is the activity of pure K-10 in the benzoylation reaction with a catalytic yield of 21.3%. 3.5 ZrO2 precursor Samples were prepared with zirconium oxychloride octahydrate, zirconium nitrate, and zirconium sulfate hydrate (Table 1). Calcination temperatures of 550 or 600°C and atmospheres of Ar or air for samples prepared from the nitrate or chloride precursors were varied (Table 1), but a strong influence on catalytic activity could not be established here. The calcination temperature (700°C) of the samples prepared from the sulfate precursor was optimized to yield a sulfur content of around 2wt.% S [Table 1: SZ/K-Sa(2.0) and -Sb(1.7)]. Use of the sulfate produced a more active SZ/Si phase (catalytic yield: 9.5%) than that of the chloride or nitrate (catalytic yield: 7.0–8.0%). Interestingly enough, when K-10 is the support, just the opposite is true. Here, the activity of the catalyst prepared from the sulfate was much lower than that synthesized from chloride: 15.7% [SZ/K-S(1.5)] compared to 28.4% for [SZ/K-2(2.0)] for the respective catalytic yields. The zirconium sulfate precursor also leads to variations in catalytic activity of the supported catalysts with yields from 9.5 to 15.7%. On the other hand, catalytic yields for those synthesized with the chloride are higher than the former and bulk SZ and more similar to each other [catalytic yield: 28.4 and 24.9% for SZ/K-2(2.0) and SZ/K-2a(3.9), respectively]. 3.6 Sulfating agent and sulfur contents Catalytic yields differ only slightly for SZ/Si-2 series samples with yields between 4 and 7.5%, which makes it difficult to determine the influence of the sulfur contents on the catalytic activity. A comparison of the series catalysts, SZ/Si-2 and SZ/Al-2 (Table 3), shows that both systems adsorb sulfate effectively (Stheor. = Sexptl.) up to about 3.0wt.% S with adsorption tapering off when Stheor. > 3.0wt.% (Table 1). It seems both systems are not able to stabilize higher sulfur contents. The sulfur contents of the supported catalysts (18wt.% S-based on ZrO2) are much higher than that of unsupported SZ (usually <5.0wt.% S [1,11–13,16,17], which was also observed in [5,6]. The samples, SZ/Al-2c(2.9) and SZ/Al-2d(3.3), show very low catalytic activity (catalytic yields: ≤1.1%); therefore, the series was not tested further catalytically. The γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts (SZ/Al-2a–e; Table 3) become inactive with increasing sulfur contents, when sulfated with H2SO4. This is probably due to the reaction of the support with H2SO4 to form Al2(SO4)3 and is indicated by the lower intensity of the γ-Al2O3 peaks and absence of the ZrO2 peak at 30° in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1c). In [6], the γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were sulfated with (NH4)2SO4 to avoid this problem. Sulfation with (NH4)2SO4 did improve catalytic yields to 5.6 and 7.0%, for samples SZ/Al-od(2.2) and -fd(2.2), respectively. In the case of the inert SiO2 support, sulfation was done exclusively with H2SO4 and is more effective and controllable: SZ/Si-2b(2.0) and SZ/Si-2b1(1.9) (Table 3). 4 Conclusions In conclusion, the highest catalytic yields in the benzoylation of anisole were achieved with K-10-supported SZ catalysts. Yet, this catalytic activity is strongly affected by the ZrO2 precursor used. Surface properties of the SZ are improved over that of bulk SZ with higher surface areas, pore volume, and pore diameter. However, the K-10-supported SZ catalyst with a low surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter, SZ/K-2(2.0), was the most active. Thus, the surface properties seem to play a secondary role in catalytic activity in comparison to other factors, such as acidity; this has been mentioned before [7]. The FTIR-PAS results agree with earlier reports on the main formation of PACs on Lewis acid sites in SZ/Al2O3 and SZ/SiO2 [6,13]. Slight changes in the total number of acid sites of SZ/SiO2 with the sulfur contents had no large effect on catalytic activity. This suggests that the number of acid sites (predominantly Lewis) in these samples is not conducive to catalytic activity. The sulfation of supported ZrO2 results in little change in acid sites, for example, from Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites, as in the case of bulk ZrO2. However, catalytic activities higher than that of bulk SZ can be achieved with the use of a support providing Brønsted acid sites, such as K-10.
