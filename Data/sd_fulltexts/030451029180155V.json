Keller Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroclaw, 50-383 Wroclaw (Poland) (Received March 25, 1991; accepted July 2, 1991) Abstract The dicomponent Mo(NO)2(OR)z-EtAIC12 and tricomponent Mo(NO)2(OR)2-Et4Sn-AIC13 catalytic systems as well as ethylidene complexes [(AlClD2(p-OR)ZMo(NO)2(CHMe)] (R= Et, 'Pr) show activity for self-metathesis of ethyl but-3-enoate and very limited activity for cometathesis of this ester with traps-hex-3-ene. Blocking of the Lewis basic functional groups of this ester with a Lewis acid (EtAIC13, AIC13), however, increased the effectiveness of the catalysts used. Metathesis reactions of Zn(oleate)2 and Al(O-aklyi)3 by both catalytic systems, without excess Lewis acid co-catalysts, demonstrate that coordination of the functional groups to the appropriate metal ions completely eliminated the poisoning effect of these groups. Metathesis of unsaturated hydrocarbons possessing hetero-atom functional groups is especially attractive for the synthesis of specific compounds which are difficult to obtain by other methods [ 1-61. Metathesis of these alkenes is in many cases hampered by the poisoning effects of the polar groups. The functional groups can react with cocatalysts to block the coordination sites on a catalyst metal or to destroy the active catalyst center [ 7 ]. Hence, not many of the known catalysts for olefin metathesis are active in metathesis of functionalized alkenes. The dinitrosylmolybdenum catalyst [Mo(NO)ZC12(PPh3)z]-EtAlCl2 has been used in metathesis reactions of olefins containing amino groups and quaternary ammonium groups [8]. The inactivity of this catalyst in the metathesis of olefins with amino groups indicates that the metathesis of such olefins may be possible by diminishing the basic character of the nitrogen. Blocking of the Lewis basic functional groups with Lewis acid cocatalysts could perhaps be used to tackle the problem of metathesis of functionalized olefins [9]. Alkylaluminum with hydrocarbons containing Lewis-base groups, e.g. esters, can form stable complexes, which after hydrolysis return the quantity of ester used, but these complexes can rearrange to give the corresponding aldehydes or ketones [ 10-12 ]. Complete elimination of the poisoning effect of the functional groups in the metathesis reaction should occur after their coordination to the appropriate metal ions. The compounds formed should be easily soluble in 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 144 the solvents used for metathesis reactions. Easy separation of metathesis products from metal ion should also be possible. This hypothesis was verified in the metathesis of Al(O-allyl)3 and Zn(oleate)2 with application of two-component (Mo(NO)2(OR)2-EWC12; 1: R = Et; 2: R ='Pr [ 13, 14 ], and three-component (Mo(NO)2(OR)2-Et4Sn-AlC13 [ 15 ]), catalytic systems which are very active in olefin metathesis. Metathesis reactions of Al(O-allyl)3 with both types of catalytic systems were carried out in PhCl solution at room temperature. These systems were prepared as described earlier for the two-component systems in [13, 14] and for the three-component systems (variant in which Et4Sn+AIC13 solution was added to solution 1 and/or 2 at 0 C) in [15]. To these systems, after 30 min (Q, the solution of Al(O-allyl)3 in PhCI was added. The conversion of alkoxy groups (reaction (1)) and the reaction conditions are given in Table 1. Al(OCHZCH=CH2)Z E--> AlOCHZCH=CHCH2 +CZH4 (la) 2AIOCH2CH=CH2 AlOCH2CH=CHCHZOAl+C2H4 (lb) Reactions (la) and (lb) produce the cis- and trans-but-3-ene-1,4-diols, respectively. The structure of the alkoxyaluminum compounds formed in the above reactions was not examined. The relatively low activity of the systems used in these metathesis reactions (Table 1) is due to the electronic effect of the allyloxy groups and to the steric hindrance in the triallyloxyaluminum molecules subjected to metathesis. The cometathesis reactions of Al(O-allyl)3 with trans-hex-3-ene (reaction (2)) were carried out with the same catalytic systems under the same reaction conditions. -OCHZCH=CHZ + ~ -OCHZCH=CHCZH5+CHZ=CHCZH5 (2) C2H5CH=CHCZH5 TABLE 1 Self-metathesis of A1(O-allyl)3' Catalyst Mo/Sn/Al 4 Conversion' (mo196) 1 + EtAIC12 1 /-/6 2.5 49 1/-/50 48 2 + EtAIC12 1 /-/6 3.0 51 1 + Et4Sn+AlC13 35 2 + Et4Sn+AIC13 1 /10/10 3.5 31 'Reaction conditions: solvent, PhCl; ageing time (ta), 30 min; Ta=Tr, room temperature; concentration of precatalysts, [Mo]=2.5x10-4 mol; [Mol:[-O-allyl]=1:300.

'The products with functional groups were not identified. 146 Propylene and ethylene undergo cometathesis with hex-3-ene and pent2-ene (reactions (9)-(12)), but isomerization of the but-2-ene formed shifted the reaction equilibrium to the right, leading to complete decomposition of the substrates.

Only hex-3-ene, but-2-ene and pent-2-ene as olefin products, in amounts defined by reaction (4), appear in the equilibrium state of the reaction of Al(O-allyl)3 with hex-3-ene. Instead, the alkoxyaluminum products are those containing the (-OCH2CH=CHC2H5), (-OCH2CH=CHCH3) and (-OCH2CH=CHCH20-) groups. The self-metathesis of Zn(oleate)2 (reaction (13)) was carried out in benzene solvent (the solubility of zinc oleate is better in benzene than in PhCl) at room temperature. The conversion of oleate groups (Table 3) was determined by estimating the yield of octadec-9-ene, which was also identified by 1H NMR. 2Zn'-'OZ 0C(CH2)7CH=CH(CH3)7CH3 H Zn~OZC(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7C~O~Zn + CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CH3 (13) 147 TABLE 3 Self-metathesis of Zn(oleate)2' Catalyst Mo/Sn/Al Products' (mo196) 1 +EtAIC12 1 /-/6 50 1 /-/50 50 2 + EtAIC12 1 /-/6 46 1 +Et4Sn+A103 1/10/10 27 2 +EtaSn+AIC13 24 'Reaction conditions: solvent, benzene; ageing time (t,), 30 min; reaction time (tr), 12 h; T8=T room temperature; concentration of precatalysts, [Mo]=2.5x10-' mol; [Mo]: [oleate] -1:100. 'According to reaction (13). The zinc octadec-3-enedioate compounds were not identified. Van Dam et al. [ 16-18 ] were the first to report the successful metathetic conversion of functionalized olefins. Using a WCIB-Me4Sn catalyst, equilibrium conversion of methyl oleate was reached within 18 h at 70 'C [16, 4] and 4 h at 100 C [19]. Comparable activity was also exhibited by other homogeneous systems based upon WCls or Mo(OEt)2C13 [20, 21 ], though they proved less selective. In the case of dinitrosyhnolybdenum catalysts, the metathesis equilibrium according to reaction (13) was reached after - 12 h (Table 3), but these reactions were carried out at room temperature and at a ratio Mo:oleate groups= 1:100. Activity of the two and three-component systems with 1 and 2 were also tested in self-metathesis of ethyl but-3-enoate (Table 4) and in its cometathesis with traps-hex-3-ene (Table 5). The results in Table 4 show that the dinitrosylmolybdenum catalytic systems convert ethyl but-3-enoate even without excess co-catalysts. Equilibrium conversions of this ester were reached within - 20-24 h at room temperature, while WC1B-Me4Sn catalyst converted this ester in 45 mo1% after 18 h at 70 C [4]. The catalytic activity of the systems used indicates that the dinitrosyl catalysts formed with nucleophilic carbene ligands, i.e. [(AIC12)2(N,OR)2Mo(NO)2(CHMe) ] (3: R = Et; 4: R = `Pr) [ 22, 23 ] and [ (AIC13 - SnEt3)2(AOR)2Mo(NO)2(CHMe)] (6: R=Et; 6: R=iPr) [24] are not destroyed by the functional groups of the metathesized ester. These groups, on interacting with aluminum of (AIC12) and (AIC13 - SnEt3) fragments, could exercise a favourable effect on the activity of the catalysts, because they inhibit their polymerization [22, 23]. The ethyl but-3-enoate molecules, which form an adduct together with catalyst molecules, undergoes metathesis, whereas their cometathesis with hex-3-ene is very difficult in such a situation (Table 5). 148 TABLE 4 Self-metathesis of ethyl but-3-enoate' Catalyst Mo/Sn/Al t, Conversion (h) (mol%) 1 + EtAIC12 1 /-/6 20 48 1 /-/50 12 50 2 + EtAIC12 1 /-/6 24 49 3 26 38 3 + EtAIC12 1 /-/30 12 43 4 26 33 1 + Et4Sn+A1C13 1 /10/10 26 30 1 /10/30 14 30 2 + Et4Sn+AIC13 1 /10/10 26 28 'Reaction conditions: solvent, PhCl; ageing time (t,), 30 min; Ta=T room temperature; concentration of precatalysts, [Mo]=2.5x10-' mol; [Mo]:[ester]=1:100. bConversion into ethylene and diethyl hex-3-enedioate.

Increasing the cocatalyst concentration considerably raised the activity of these catalysts because the Lewis-base functional groups are blocked, making their competitive complexation with the metal center very difficult. The blocking of the functional groups also facilitates the co-metathesis reactions. The isolated ethylidene complexes 3 and 4 are somewhat less powerful catalysts of ethyl but-3-enoate metathesis than appropriate systems in which they are formed (Table 4). They also very weakly catalyzed cometathesis of the ester with hex-3-ene (Table 5). The Lewis acid interaction with ethylidene 149 catalysts, like the catalytic systems used, accelerate the self-metathesis reaction and facilitate the cometathesis reaction. Experimental All reagents and solvents were purified, dried and stored under argon atmosphere.
