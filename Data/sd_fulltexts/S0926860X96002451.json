The activity increases from MCM-41 and Mor to B and Y zeolites, the latter being the most active catalysts. In addition, HY zeolites are much more efficient as catalysts than p-toluenesulfonic acid under the same reaction conditions. As alkylating reagent tert-butyl alcohol was employed in isooctane or carbon tetrachloride. It was found that isooctane itself is a powerful and convenient reagent for the tert-butylation. Mechanistic studies using radical scavengers indicates that in the isooctane alkylation tert-butyl cation is the sole intermediate involved. In the case of thianthrene, the concomitant formation of the thianthrenium radical cation during the alkylation reaction has been observed.

Introduction One of the major achievements of zeolites as acid catalysts has been the shape-selective para methylation of toluene by ZSM-5 [1-4].

Armengol et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 411-423 formed in amounts below those expected by the thermodynamic composition is their larger molecular size that strongly impedes their diffusion through the channel system of medium pore size pentasil zeolites [4-7]. Since it is generally assumed that the catalytic activity of zeolites is predominantly due to the much larger internal surface [8,9], it is reasonable to envision that analogous shape- selectivity effects can also be observed for large pore zeolites provided that the dimensions and topology of the micropores suit well enough to discriminate between the molecular sizes of different reagents, products or transition states involved in a particular process. However, the fact is that genuine examples of shape-selectivity for large pore zeolites (pore apertures containing 12 oxygen atoms) are much more scarce and of less importance than those found for medium pore size zeolites (pore apertures having 10 oxygen atoms). Therefore, the considerable attention that has been paid after the initial reports that the liquid phase diisopropylation of biphenyl and naphthalene catalyzed by mordenite exhibits shape selectivity is understandable [ 10-17]. The products arising in these alkylations, 4,4'-diisopropylbiphenyl from biphenyl and mixtures 2,6- and 2,7-diisopropylnaphthalene from naphthalene, are valuable synthetic intermediates since the lateral chain oxidation affords aromatic dicar- boxylic acids employed in the preparation of polymers displaying thermotropic liquid crystal properties. In this context, the activity and selectivity of large pore zeolites as acid catalysts for the alkylation of condensed polynuclear aromatic compounds deserves further examination. In the present work, we have studied the liquid phase tert-butylation of anthracene, naphthalene and thianthrene. We reasoned that the tert-butyl group being a much bulkier substituent than the isopropyl may be more suitable to observe larger degrees of shape-selectivity. In addition, taking into account the relative stability of isopropyl and tert-butyl cations, the experimental conditions to perform the tert-butylation will be milder than those employed for the isopropylation that requires temperatures about 140 in the autoclave. Thus, we have found that alkylation of polynuclear aromatic com- pounds with tert-butanol over zeolites in the liquid phase at 80 gives rise to the 2-tert-butyl derivative, together with variable amounts of di-tert-butylated products. Furthermore, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) as solvent has been found to be a very convenient alkylating medium to carry out this tert-butyla- tion. Mechanistic studies using radical scavengers have ruled out the intermedi- acy of tert-butyl radicals in the isooctane alkylation. 2. Experimental 2.1.

Oval-shaped cages of 12 A. acetate. The solid was filtered, washed, dried (100, 5 h) and calcined (500, 2 h). The resulting partially exchanged NaHY sample was submitted to two additional exchange-calcination cycles under the same conditions as above but using 0.4 M and 0.6 M solutions of ammonium acetate. HY-D1 (Si/A1 = 2.75, unit cell size 24.53 ,~) and HY-D2 (Si/A1 -- 15, unit cell size 24.32 ,~) were commercial samples (PQ Industries, CBV-500 and CBV-720, respectively). H-Mordenite (Si/A1 = 10) was supplied by PQ Indus- tries (CBV 20A). H/3 was obtained by thermal decomposition (773 K, N2 stream, 2 h) of the tetraethylammonium from an as-synthesized sample prepared according to the literature [18]. MCM-41 was synthesized by using amorphous silica (Aerosil 200, Degussa) and a 25% aqueous solution of tetramethylammo- nium hydroxide and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as templates [ 19,20]. The Si/A1 ratio determined by chemical analysis was 11.3, while the pore size distribution measured by Ar adsorption was 30 A. The main physicochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. 2.2. Reaction procedure The catalyst (250 rag) previously activated (500, overnight) was added to an isooctane solution (25 ml) of the corresponding polynuclear aromatic com- pound (anthracene, naphthalene and thianthrene, 100 mg) and tert-butyl alcohol in a molar ratio 1:2. Nitrobenzene (100 mg) was added as internal standard. The resulting suspension was magnetically stirred at constant temperature using a thermostated bath. The course of the reaction was periodically followed by analysing the organic phase using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m capillary column of 5% phenylmethylsilicone. At the end of the reaction, the solid was filtered and submitted to exhaustive solid-liquid extraction using a micro-Soxhlet equipment and dichloromethane as solvent. The solid was anal- ysed by UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-2101 PC 414 E. Armengol et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 411-423 scanning spectrophotometer using an integration sphere) and thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (Netzsch-STA 409 EP thermobalance under air atmosphere). The organic phases (from the reaction and the catalyst extraction) were separately concentrated under vacuum, weighed and analysed by gas chromatog- raphy (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Varian Saturn II, same column and conditions as GC), 300 MHz 1H-nuclear magnetic reso- nance (1H-NMR) (Varian Geminis, CDC13 as solvent, TMS as internal standard) and GC-FTIR (HP 5890 gas chromatograph, same column as GC-MS, coupled with a FT-IR HP 5965A detector). 2.3. Bromination of mixtures of di-tert-butylanthracenes (DTBA) A mixture of 2,6- and 2,7-di-tert-butylanthracenes (100 mg) and cupric bromide (160 mg) in distilled carbon tetrachloride (20 ml) was refluxed for 20 h under N2 according to the method reported in the literature [21 ]. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was filtered to remove the insoluble residue and washed with fresh carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate was analysed by CG and CG-MS, showing the presence of three bromo derivatives. 3. Results and discussion In the first stage of our work, we studied the tert-butylafion of anthracene. This reaction has been already reported in the vapor phase catalyzed by zeolites and other acids using tert-butyl alcohol to afford tert-butylanthracene and unidentified di-tert-butyl derivatives [22]. In our case, the alkylations were carried out in the liquid phase, most of them at 80, in isooctane using the series of acid large pore zeolites as catalysts. In all the reactions, 2-tert-buty- lanthracene (2-TBA) was the major product, together with variable amounts of two di-tert-butylated isomers (DTBA) and very minor percentages of a mono alkyl derivative tentatively assigned as 2-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)anthracene (2-TMBA) based on its MS, IR and 1H-NMR spectra (vide infra). The results obtained are presented in Scheme 1 and Table 2. Complete structural analysis of the alkylation products was not a trivial task. Thus, the structure of 2-TBA was confirmed by comparison of its retention time as well as its IR and 1H-NMR spectra with those of an authentic commercial sample (Aldrich) of this compound. We were not able to isolate the pure DTBA isomers by column chromatography, but these mixtures were free of any other reaction product. These two isomers could not be resolved in two peaks either by GC or thin layer chromatography. Essentially the same mixture of the two DTBA isomers, although in a much higher yield, was obtained using 2-TBA instead of anthracene as starting material for the alkylation. This is a proof that E.

Aromatic region of the i H-NMR spectrum of the mixture of positional di-tert-hutyl isomers 2,6-DTBA and 2,7-DTBA obtained in the alkylation of anthracene over acid zeolites. were split suggesting the presence of both isomers. Experimental evidence of the presence of two positional isomers was gained by submitting the mixture to bromination following reported procedures [21]. The formation of three bromo derivatives (Scheme 2) proves that the mixture contained two compounds: 2,6-DTBA and 2,7-DTBA. The same mixture has been previously obtained using conventional Lewis acid catalysts [23], and therefore, no shape-selectivity can be claimed to justify these results. On the other hand, 2-TMBA shows in MS a molecular ion of 290 daltons which looses a fragment of 71 daltons. The characteristic absorption of out-of- plane bending of aromatic hydrogens in the IR indicates the same substitution pattern as 2-TBA while in ~H-NMR signals for two different methyl groups ,~ 2,7-DTBA CuBr2 / COl4 Br Scheme 2. E. A rmengol et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 411-423 417 were observed. In addition, 2-TMBA was not formed using CC14 as solvent. All these facts are compatible with the structure proposed for 2-TMBA. A reason- able explanation to account for the formation of this product is presented in Scheme 1, and is based in the hydride transfer from isooctane to tert-butyl cation or the acid sites of the zeolite to give 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylium ion which would be responsible for the formation of 2-TMBA. Besides, Olah and Lukas have established that this cation decomposes to afford tert-butyl cation [24]. Concerning the activity of acid zeolites as catalysts, the conversion of anthracene and the yield of alkylation products increase notably from mordenite to B and Y zeolites, being higher in the latter. This trend can be easily interpreted in terms of the increasing dimensions of the zeolite internal voids, where the reaction is believed to occur. In contrast, MCM-41 with a similar Si/A! ratio displays a low activity, reflecting the much weaker acidity of the sites for this extra large pore aluminosilicate [25]. For the sake of comparison, we performed the alkylation using para-toluensulfonic acid (PTSA) under homogeneous conditions. The results also included in Table 2 clearly shows that zeolites are the better catalyst choice for this process. With regard to the role played by isooctane on the nuclear alkylation, comparison of results using tert-butyl alcohol in CC14 as solvent instead of isooctane reveals that the anthracene conversions are almost double in the latter solvent than in Cfl4. This indicates that isooctane is intervening somehow in the reaction. In fact, we have found that isooctane itself is a very convenient and powerful reagent for the tert-butylation of polynuclear aromatic compounds at reflux temperature. It has been already reported that 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylium ion decomposes to give tert-butyl cation [24]. We were interested in disclosing if the intermediates involved in the isooctane tert-butylation were exclusively ionic or if tert-butyl radicals were also in- volved. In order to address this point, we attempted radical trapping with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy radical (TEMPO) or quenching by radical inhibitors such as 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisol (BHA) during the course of the reaction. No influence of these additives was observed, 2-TBA and DTBA being formed essentially at the same rate in the presence or absence of radical scavengers. (During the tert-butylation of anthracene by isooctane in the pres- ence of BHA, the formation of a tert-butylation product derived from BHA was detected). As it has been indicated in Scheme 1, this lack of influence rules out the intermediacy of radical species in the formation of 2-TBA and DTBA. ~, CH3 OH CH3\"~'CH3 UH:H3~C OH3f ~N/ -OH3 O OCH3 TEMPO BHA 418 E.

Diffuse reflectance spectrum (inverse of the reflectivity, I/R) of the HY-100 zeolite after being used as catalyst for the tert-butylation of anthracene. The spectrum shows the characteristic vibrational structure of anthracenes around 350 nm. The insert corresponds to an expansion of the 720-nm band attributable to anthracene radical cation around 700 nm. Furthermore, diphenylmethane that can react differently with alkyl cations or radicals giving rise to products of nuclear or lateral chain alkylations, respec- tively, affords exclusively aromatic substitution when treated with isooctane in the presence of HY-100. A point of interest arose from the observation that the diffuse reflectance spectra of the Y catalysts after the reaction showed the characteristic absorption spectrum of anthracene or its alkyl derivatives (Fig. 2). Since these diffuse reflectance spectra were persistent after exhaustive solid-liquid extraction of the catalysts, it is unlikely that unsubstituted anthracene was the compound respon- sible for these spectra. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that while unsubstituted anthracene can diffuse through the zeolite micropores, tert-butyl derivatives will experience a larger geometrical constrains which will imply a slower diffusion rate of the alkylated products. In fact, it has been found that 9-tert-butylanthra- cene or 9,10-dimethylanthracene cannot enter through the 7.4 A apertures of the Y zeolites supercages [26-29]. To show that the retained organic material after its use as catalyst in the reaction corresponds to tert-butyl anthracene derivatives, we submitted these samples to HF disggregation. After neutralization and extraction with CH2C12, a complex mixture of mono and di-tert-butylanthracenes was observed by GC-MS. Besides anthracene, we also carded out the tert-butylation of naphthalene and thianthrene under similar conditions to those employed previously. The results are presented in Scheme 3 and Tables 3 and 4 for naphthalene and thianthrene, respectively. The highest conversions and product yields were again obtained using isooctane as alkylating agent in the absence of tert-butyl alcohol. E.

As an example, Fig. 3 presents the aromatic region of the 1H-NMR spectrum of the di-tert-butylthianthrene showing the presence of the two isomers, even though one single peak was observed by GC under a wide range of conditions.

Diffuse reflectance spectrum (inverse of the reflectivity, l/R) of HY-100 zeolite after being used in the tert-butylation of TH. The absorption band at 600 nm indicates the presence of TH+ \". nucleii, another possible explanation has to do with the observation that thianthrene radical cation (TH +') was formed during the course of the reaction. TH+\" is one of the best documented radical cations in liquid phase [30-38] and it is known that can be generated by dissolving TH (Ereaox = 1.34 V vs. NHE [39,40]) in sulfuric or perchloric acids. TH can be unambiguously identified by its very characteristic UV/Vis absorption spectrum, that presents a doublet in the UV at 270 nm and a very characteristic absorption in the visible around 600 nm. Recently, we have established that TH is formed by merely adsorbing neutral thianthrene onto dehydrated acid zeolites [41]. As Fig. 4 shows, this radical cation intermediate was also present during the tert-butyla- tion of thianthrene. It is known that TH+\" can behave as electrophile against electron-rich arenes [42], but on the other hand it is reasonable to expect that this positive species will be highly reluctant to the attack of tert-butyl cation. Incidentally, we also noticed in the diffuse reflectance spectrum of anthracenes entrapped inside the zeolite catalyst after their use in the tert-butylation (Fig. 2) the appearance in the visible of a weak band (A = 715 nm) that could also be attributed to the presence of the corresponding anthracene radical cation [43,44]. With regard to the activity of the catalysts, the trend found for anthracene was again observed, increasing the conversions and the product yields from morden- ite to 13 and Y. MCM-41 was highly inefficient to catalyze these reactions. In conclusion, large pore acid zeolites, particularly Y zeolite, are convenient catalysts to perform the tert-butylation of polycyclic aromatic compounds. In addition to the 2-tert-butyl derivative, variable amounts of 2,6 and 2,7 di-tert- butyl isomers are also formed. This selectivity is the same that has been reported in the literature for the tert-butylation of anthracene using A1C13 or liquid acids. Isooctane has been found to be an exceedingly good reagent and solvent for this 422 E. Armengol et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 411-423 process. No evidence for the involvement of tert-butyl radicals could be obtained. In the case of thianthrene, the concomitant formation of the corre- sponding radical cation during the course of the reaction was also observed.

Liquid phase tert-butylation of anthracene, naphthalene and thianthrene to afford 2-tert-butyl plus 2,6- and 2,7-di tert-butyl derivatives were carried out at atmospheric pressure and moderate temperatures (below 100°C) in the presence of a series of large pore zeolites and mesoporous aluminosilicates including HY-100 (Si/Al 2.6), HY-D1 (Si/Al 2.75), HY-D2 (Si/Al 15), Hβ, HMor and MCM-41. The activity increases from MCM-41 and Mor to β and Y zeolites, the latter being the most active catalysts. In addition, HY zeolites are much more efficient as catalysts than p-toluenesulfonic acid under the same reaction conditions. As alkylating reagent tert-butyl alcohol was employed in isooctane or carbon tetrachloride. It was found that isooctane itself is a powerful and convenient reagent for the tert-butylation. Mechanistic studies using radical scavengers indicates that in the isooctane alkylation tert-butyl cation is the sole intermediate involved. In the case of thianthrene, the concomitant formation of the thianthrenium radical cation during the alkylation reaction has been observed.
