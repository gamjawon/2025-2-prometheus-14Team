Six phospho- rusCuT) ligands with rather different electronic and steric properties were chosen and the course of the reaction was found to be little dependent on their nature. Very similar behaviour of propadiene and propyne towards a nickel(O) catalytic centre in oligomerization was established, propadiene being the more reactive monomer. Introduction Co-oligomerization of propadiene with propyne catalyzed by nickel(II) 2,4-pentanedionate was studied first in the work of Benson an Lindsey [1] over thirty years ago. We have recently studied the reaction again [2], using two nickel(O) complexes as catalysts, namely bis(l,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)nickel. The spectrum of products was found to be considerably broader than that originally reported [I], and dependent on the type of catalyst, the presence of phosphane ligand decreasing at the same time as the degree of oligomerization. Recently, a renewed interest in catalytic cyclotrimerization and cyclo- tetramerization of various alkynes has appeared. From our [2] and older [1] works, it follows that propadiene and propyne give oligomerization products with similar structures. Our principal aim was then to draw attention again to the propadiene monomer as the first member of a homologous series of cumulenes. The direct comparison of propadiene and propyne reactivities in oli- gomerization and the evaluation of possibilities to control the selectivity is of interest for future work on propadiene and other cumulene oligomerizations using the systems designed originally for alkyne oligomerization. Thus we decided to study the influence of the nature of the phosphane ligand in tetrakis(ligand)nickel(0) complex catalysts on the course of the co-oligomerization at two different temperatures. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 306 Although the choice of phosphane ligands is at the same time limited to those with small or moderate steric size, since complexes with bulky ligands cannot be prepared [3 5], it allows exclusion of the presence of ligands other than phosphorus(III) and monomers in competition for coor- dination to the catalytic centre. Ligands were chosen so as to cover, as far as possible, a broad range of electronic and steric properties of phosphanes and phosphites, Bidentate l,2-bisCdiphenylphosphino)ethane, which forms a bis(ligand) but tetra- kis(donor atom) complex, was included for the purpose of evaluation of the chelate effect. Experimental Materials Propadiene (Matheson, 98% purity) and propyne (Merck, 96% purity) were dried by passing them through a 3A molecular sieve column, after which they were condensed and degassed. Toluene used as the solvent was dried by distillation with sodium dihydridobis(2-methoxyethoxo)aluminate and finally distilled on a vacuum line. Solid catalysts were prepared and handled under an argon atmosphere with the use of Schlenk-type glassware. Complexes tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)nickel [6], tetrakis(tri-n-butylphos- phine)nickel [6], [l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane]nickel [6], tetrakis[tri(o- tolyl)phosphite]nickel [5], tetrakis[tri(J -tolyl)phosphite]nickel [7], and te- trakis(triethylphosphite)nickel [6] were prepared according to reported pro- cedures as indicated. Co-oligomemations Preparation and handling of Ni(0) complex solutions and introduction of monomers were made in vacua at ca. 10~2 Pa, using the break-seal vacuum line technique. Nickel concentration in storing solutions was checked independently by AAS analysis. After introduction of the 1:1 mixture of monomers (0.4 g) into the solution of the catalyst (4 ml) in an ampoule, the ampoule was sealed off and placed in a thermostat at the desired temperature for the desired time with vibrational mixing. After the reaction and until analysis, ampoules were stored at dry ice temperature. Analysis The contents of the ampoule were frozen with liquid nitrogen, the ampoule opened and quickly attached to the vacuum line, and 0.3 g of propane as an internal chromatographic standard were condensed into it. The ampoule was then sealed off again, placed in a bath at 40 to -30 C, opened, mixed and analyzed for unreacted monomers by GLC on a 2 m long, 3 mm i.d. Porapak N column at 110 C. After warming to room temperature, approximately 0.1 g of naphthalene was added to the ampoule as a second internal standard, and the contents 307 were analyzed once more on a HP 5890 gas chromatograph with HP 3396A integrator using a temperature programme on a 50 m quartz capillary column containing HP 1 stationary phase. Products were identified by comparison of their reduced retention times (related to naphthalene) with the results of the previous study [2]. Yields of oligomers are related to naphthalene and are only relative, as response factors were not available for all the products. Results and discussion As mentioned previously, the spectrum of co-oligomerization products is broad. Propadiene homo-oligomers 1,2,4-trimethylenecyclohexane 1, 1,2,4,7-tetramethylenecyclooctane 2 and 1,2,4,6,9-pentamethylenecyclode- cane 3, and propyne homo-oligomers 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene 4, 1,3,5-tri- methylbenzene 5, 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclooctatetraene 6, 1,2,4,7-tetrame- thylcyclooctatetraene 7 and 1,2,4,6-tetramethylcyclooctatetraene 8 were found. They were accompanied by co-oligomers l-methyl-3,5-dimethylene- cyclohexene 9, l-methyl-3,6-dimethylenecyclohexene 10, l-methyl-4,5-di- methylenecyclohexene 11, l-methyl-4,6-dimethylenecyclohexene 12, 3.5-di- methyl-l-(2-methyl-2-propenyl)benzene 13, ( ')-l-(2-butenyl)-3,5- dimethylbenzene 14, l-methyl-4,5,7-trimethylenecyclooctene 15, and 2-me- thyl-4,5,7-trimethylenecyclooctene 16, together with an unidentified copen- tamer 17 formed [2] from three molecules of propyne and two of propadiene. In addition, in some cases a large number of other oligomers (molecular weight checked by GC/MS) were formed. These could not be isolated and structurally characterized owing to their relatively small yield and the overall complexity of the reaction mixture; all the oligomers are (CgH^n. (w=3, 4, 5) isomers. l 2 3 4 5 308 678 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Conversion vs. yield of oligomers Trimers, tetramers and pentamers are not the only products of the co- oligomerization. In preliminary experiments, a small amount of higher oli- gomers (i.e. higher than pentamers) was detected by GC/MS. This could explain why the yield of oligomers in all cases is lower than monomer conversion (Table 1). The second reason is the instability of some of the oligomers under reaction conditions, which was also found in preliminary experiments. This second factor is probably responsible for the highest difference between oligomer yield and conversion in the case of tetra- kis(triphenylphosphine)nickel catalysis at 90 C (54% and 96% resp.). Owing to differences in catalyst activity, 10 h reaction time was chosen in preliminary experiments at 70 C as a compromise between sufficient conversion and further reactions of oligomers. Conversion and yield of oligomers increase with bulkmess of the ligand as characterized by the Tolman parameter [ 8 ] 0, independently of its electronic properties. As it is bulkiness of the phosphane ligand which determines the dissociation constant of ?1,4 complexes [9], it may be concluded that the w a ^ (u t 3 S ''3- & !

Reactivity of propadiene vs. propyne To evaluate the relative reactivity of propadiene and propyne in the co- oligomerization, the total share of propadiene in the products was computed from the known [2] relative proportion of monomer units in the oligomers. The oligomers denoted as 'other' trimers, tetramers and pentamers had to be excluded. The second source of inaccuracy was the possibility of aromatic trimers 4 and 5 being formed not only by propyne cyclotrimerization but also by isomerization of precursors containing two propyne and one propadiene units, which was established in deuterium trace experiments [2]. Nevertheless, in most cases the total share of propadiene in the oligomers is higher than 50%, although leaving out 'other' oligomers and counting 4 and 5 as purely propyne trimers may decrease this share. The values of the total share of propadiene are at the same time in accord with the individual monomer conversions found in Table 1. With the exception of l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane complex ca- talysis, the total share of propadiene in oligomers decreases with temperature although the conversion and yield of oligomers increase. This means that the growth in conversion and yield of oligomers is caused by higher involvement of propyne in co-oligomerization at higher temperature. From the above discussion it follows that propadiene is more reactive than propyne, especially at lower temperatures. Selectivity The co-oligomerization is non-selective (Table 2), which precludes its synthetic utilization. Attempts to improve selectivity by changes in monomer ratio were unsuccessful [10] and an equimolar monomer ratio was chosen. The presence of homo-oligomers seems unavoidable but on the other hand it allows comparison of the influence of ligand nature on the course of reaction in co-oligomerization and in both homo-oligomerizations. This will be shown using the examples of tributylphosphine and tris(p-tolyl)phosphite complex catalysis. Propadiene homo-oligomerization [10] catalyzed by [Ni{P(n-C4H9)3}4] gives cyclotetramer 2 as a main product. The same cyclotetramer predominates among propadiene homo-oligomers in its co-oligomerization with propyne. Similarly, with [Ni{P(0 p-tolyl)3}4] the course of propadiene homo-oligo- merization is shifted towards the formation of cyclotrimer 1 [10, II], which is also the main propadiene homo-oligomer in the co-oligomerization. Similar trends in the influence of ligand type on the reaction may be found in propyne homo-oligomerization. The equal influence of ligand type on homo-oligomer distribution in homo-oligomerization and in co-oligomerization suggests that in these reac- 2 2 /- -^ 5 1 E- 1' | S |- 3 e S . -0. f ~.^ CO E2 \" S 0 -* ^ \"n r x <u w '3, f^ e 0 u ' > 1 \"3 s + -<;1 1 la1-1 'S 8) V'3 N Mti <U 00 iS E + ^ ^ t- S ^ + ^ TS <U 2 ^ 1 1 0 Cu U c0 <r 'S N 'C 11 10 E 0 Bt^ N -) 0 6 / ^S + u ^ u-S ^e :iu T-I +e s01 ikl a &> 1 | 1-1 t-t 1 0 & 0 s s N S H .53 13 o c m w ? ^ a3 OCTO'r^i ioi^-'^'ioooi CO i-iTi<'q<T}i'q''fl<ioio>0 oio>no osoootOW(M[^ io^r loia'w'vio^s'nmi ooaiocooo' iooNos'^' rt t0 00 -i C-WO^lOOtOtOOO'-iWC'- (M IM'-fCO-llMCOIMIMW OCOC-OOOOS'^'IM^COOiCT CT <M ^ W CO (M CO o^roiioto^'f^i'-'ftoco N ^-ICO -ICO^.-IIM OC-OOOOOtOOOOO't'-i CO rt CTN'^WOOf-CTlCO.-lOflO OiCOCOlOlM (0 <' IM OC~C<10000i[~'<'C<l 000 i 0-1 CO -I -I N CO Q^ ^'i \"' s'a B a a \" <->!-' ci, CL, Tr ^< co (M C4 C4 I I II ,- ;, ;(-) 3 IT?

Interference of the second monomer then leads to co-oligomers. With the exception of 1,2-bisCdiphenylphosphino)ethane and triethyl- phosphite complex catalysis at 90 C, eight-membered cyclic co-oligomers and propyne homo-oligomers are only minor products, which is in accord with previous results [2] and general trends of selectivity in propadiene homo-oligomerization [11]. On the other hand, a preference for trimers was found only for tris(p-tolyl)phosphite among the phosphite ligands. More electron-donating phosphines prefer aromatic trimers 4 and 5; moreover, the corresponding individual propyne conversions reach 100%. Bidentate l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane at 90 C causes a substantial increase in the selectivity of propadiene oligomers and lower individual propyne conversion than those found at 70 C, which is in contrast to the trend found with monodentate ligands. Furthermore, although this ligand prefers propadiene trimer, which could be expected from the chelate effect, tetramer and pentamer were also found in substantial amounts. Conclusion The present study shows that co-oligomerization of propadiene and propyne catalyzed by tetrakis(phosphorus(III)ligand)nickelCO) complexes is a non-selective reaction whose course cannot be substantially influenced by the nature of the ligand in the complex. Homo-oligomers are formed along with co-oligomers; the influence of ligand type on their formation in the co- oligomerization suggests competition between propadiene and propyne mono- mer units in the co-oligomerization. The mutual reactivity of monomers is comparable, propadiene being reactive, especially at lower (70 C) temperature. The activity of nickel(O) complex catalyst measured by monomer conversion roughly increases with the bulkiness of the ligand in that complex. The increase in conversion at the same time is due to higher involvement of propyne in co-oligomerization. References 1 R. E. Benson and R. V. Lindsey, Jr., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 81 (1959) 4250. 2 J.
