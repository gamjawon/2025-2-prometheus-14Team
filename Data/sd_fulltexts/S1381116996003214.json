D-53121 Bonn, Germam, Abstract The behavior of a manganese substituted a-Keggin silicon tungstoheteropolyanion (K6S'W1,OsyMn(ll)(H=O)) under electrochemical oxidation conditions was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry in phosphate buffer. Substitution of the water ligand by counter anions (L: HZP04 or HP04-) leading to SiW1,Os9Mn(ll)(L) was observed. Replacement of the counter anion by an aquo ligand was observed in cyclic voltammetry by continuous cycling. After oxidation of S'W,1039Mn(Il)(L) to S'W11039Mn(1V)(L), this counter anion L was in turn substituted by OH-. The thus formed complex S'W1103yMn(1V)(OH) oxidizes different alcohols, the reactivity of which decreases as follows: 1-phenyl-ethanol, benzylalcohol > iso-propanol > ethanol.

Introduction Homogeneous catalytic oxidations have been one of the most interesting areas of chemical research. Numerous metalloporphyrin-based systems including iron, manganese, cobalt, chromium and ruthenium have been described [ 1 ]. Recently, considerable attention has been directed towards metal substituted a-Keggin heteropolyanions as analogues of metalloporphyrins [2]. From a-Keggin heteropolyanions (AB 12040), so-called `lacunary heteropolyanions' (AB 11039) are derived by removing one B06 unit. Many transition metals (Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ru etc.) can Corresponding author. 1381-I 169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PIIS1381-1169(96)00321-4 fill this hole, giving rise to metal substituted a-Keggin heteropolyanions such as PW11039Co(H20). Similar to metalloporphyrins, metal substituted a-Keggin heteropolyanions can work as oxygen carriers. These transition metals M\"+ accept oxygen from different oxygen donors (e.g. iodosylarenes, peroxides, etc.) and the thus formed oxometal species M\"+2 =O are able to oxidize various organic substrates like hydrocarbons, alcohols and olefins [2]. The heteropolyanion ligands are robust under strongly oxidative conditions and thus have an important advantage over metalloporphyrin systems, which decompose under these conditions. The electrochemical properties of the PW11039Ru [3,4], PW11039Cr [5], S'W1103,)Fe [6-8], S'W, ~039Re and PW, I03qRe [9] have 222 M. Sadakane, E. Steckhan/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 221-228 been reported. The transition metal incorporated in the heteropolyanion resides in an octahedral environment with one coordination site occupied by a labile water molecule. On electrochemical oxidation in aqueous media this water ligand works as oxygen source. The aquo transition metal complex M(III)(H20) (M = Ru, Cr and Re) was oxidized to an oxo transition metal complex M(V) = O by removing two protons. In our group, heteropolyanions have been used as electrochemical catalysts in a double-mediator system in combination with electrochemically generated NaI04 [10]. In this work, we have focused our attention on manganese substituted a-Keggin silicon tungstoheteropolyanion for the application as an electrochemically regenerable mono-mediator system. This complex (S'W11039Mn(II)) can catalyze the oxidation of phenols, olefins and hydrocarbons in combination with some stoichiometric oxidants [2]. Recently, Pope and his co-workers have oxidized some Mn(II)-substituted polyoxotungstate XW11039Mn(II)(H20) (X = Si, P, B and Zn) chemically and electrochemically and characterized them by spectroscopy [11]. They proposed that in the electrooxidation the corresponding manganese complex is oxidized to the Mn(IV)(OH) complex rather than to Mn(V)(=O). However, no detailed electrochemical studies of this complex have appeared. In this paper, we want to present the electrooxidative behavior of K6S'W11039Mn(II)(H20) as examined by means of cyclic voltammetry and application as oxidation catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Material The potassium salts of the lacunary heteropolyanion K8S'W11039-13H20 [12] and the manganese substituted Keggin heteropolyanion K6S'W11039Mn(II)(H20)-6H20 [13] were prepared as the a-isomer according to the procedure described previously. The water content of the isolated salts was calculated from thermogravimetric measurements based on the total loss in weight until 350. Each solution was prepared from KH 2 P04 (Ferak Berlin, Analytic Grade), KOH (Riedel-de Ha, reagent grade), 85 % H 3 P04 (Riedel-de Ha, reagent grade) and water that had been purified by passage through a purification train. All alcohols used in the kinetics study, were of analytical grade and used without further purification. 2.2. Equipment and procedures Electrochemical measurements were conducted with conventional commercially available instruments using two- or three-compartment cells with a BAS100B/W system (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, Indiana). A glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag/AgCI reference electrode (3 M KCl, Cypress Systems, Inc., Lawrence, Kansas) were used. The glassy carbon working electrode (diameter 3 mm) was polished with silicium carbide (1000 mesh), washed with bi-distilled water before use without previous sonication [6]. The experiments were conducted at ambient temperature. E112 values were calculated from cyclic voltammetry as the average of the cathodic and anodic peak potentials for the oxidative and reductive waves. UV-vis spectra were recorded at 25 by using a Cary 1 UV-vis spectrometer (Varian) with a 1 cm quartz cells. Thermogravimetric analyses were obtained with STA/QMS-system 409/429-403 (Netzsch-Gerebau, Selb). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Cyclic uoltammetry Fig. 1(a) shows a cyclic voltammogram of a 1 mM solution of the `lacunary heteropolyanion' K8S'W39 in 0.5 M KH2P04 solution (pH 4.2). The two large reversible peaks can be attributed to the two two-electron reduction steps `m 0 -10 M. Sadakane, E. Steckhan/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 221-228 of the lacunary heteropolyanion K gSIWt t039. The two small reduction waves are supposed to be reduction peaks of SiWt204incorporated as impurities. A small peak that appears as a shoulder at -0.52 V probably is an oxidation wave of the /3-isomer which is generated during the reduction of the original a-isomer at the potential of the second wave [6]. Therefore, this anodic wave attributed to the (3-isomer is absent at scan rates greater than 500 mV s-'. Fig. 1(b) shows a cyclic voltammogram of a 1 mM solution of K6SiW1,039Mn(II)(H20) in 0.5 M KHZP04 (pH 4.2). The posirions of the two two-electron reduction waves for the lacunary anion moved slightly as compared with the manganese free system, and the fact that the magnitudes of the pair of cathodic peaks for the Mn(II) derivatives were almost identical with those of the parent anions shows that the Mn(II) center is not reducible to Mn(I) within the potential range examined in Fig. 1. Two new redox pairs at 0.59 V (anodic) and 0.47 V zo g 10 0 -10 (a) 20' 10 0,, -10,, 1,0 o,s o,a -o,s -1,0 223 (cathodic), respectively at 1.14 V (anodic) and 1.00 V (cathodic) appeared. The second oxidation wave was superimposed on the anodic background current. In the pH 6.0 solution (0.5 M KH Z P04 + 0.5 M KOH, Fig. 1(c)), the reversible redox pair at 0.60 V (anodic) and 0.48 V (cathodic) was retained, while the oxidation peak for the second redox pair was almost indistinguishable from the background current. The respective reduction peak was observed at 0.93 V. As shown in Fig. 2, with continuous scanning of the potential region from 0 to 1.3 V, the first oxidative peak shifted to a more negative potential, and the second oxidation peak developed with increasing number of scans. Additionally, all peak currents increased. Fig. 3 shows the change of the peak potential, El /a , and the peak current of the first redox pair with the number of scans. With continuous cycling, all peaks finally reach a stable value (consolidated peaks).

This tendency was also observed at pH 4.2 (0.5 M KH z P04 solution). The two redox waves in the positive potential area were growing and reached the consolidated peaks. All peak currents were linearly depending on the square root of the voltage scan rate (1-144 mV s-') indicating that all electrode processes are diffusion controlled. Each of these two consolidated reversible redox pairs corresponds to a single electron transfer. This is suggested by the peak currents of these oxidation peaks being roughly equal to half the value of those of the 2-electron-reduction peaks in Fig. 1(d) and was also confirmed by the charge consumption in exhaustive electrolysis (vide infra). Therefore, the redox couples could be attributed to the redox pairs MnII/III and MnIII/IV, respectively. The shape-change of the voltammogram by continuous cycling during cyclic voltammetry was also observed in other solutions like 0.5 M KOAc, 0.5 M KCl and 0.1 M KC104 in the pH range in which the heteropolyanion is stable [13]. 3.2. Effect of pH and ion strength Because the peaks of the first scan depended on the electrode pretreatment, the attention was first focused on the consolidated peaks. Within the pH ranges in which the compounds were stable [13], the effect of the pH upon the redox potentials of the stable peaks is summarized. The peak separations were typically 70-100 mV. Fig. 4(a) shows the dependence of E1/2 on the pH value with constant potassium concentration for the two anodic waves. The E1/2 of MnIII/tv showed a clear linear dependence on the pH with a slope of 57 mV per pH value. This means that one proton is involved in the redox step. The consolidated redox couple MnII/III, however, shows no pH dependence but depends on the concentration of the potassium canon. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the E,/Z of MnIynI changed ca. 62 mV per -log[K+]. This suggests that the potassium canon is in- M. Sadakane, E. Steckhan/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 221-228 volved in this redox step. The change of the EI/, of MnIII/lv with the concentration of potassium cations is negligible. This can be understood in analogy to the results reported by J.E. Toth and F.C. Anson [6] for the corresponding iron substituted heteropolyanion. They have reported a similar dependence of the peak potential on the cation concentration of the electrolyte for the reduction of the iron substituted heteropolyanion S'WI]039Fe(III)(H20)5-. This was rationalyzed by the formation of ion-pairs of the iron substituted heteropolyanion with the cation of the supporting electrolyte, facilitating the reduction of the very negative heteropolyanion. 3.3.

Correction for the background current was performed by using the BAS 100B/W system. First, electrolysis was performed at 0.85 V until the UV-vis spectra did not change any more. A net charge of 0.92 F/mot was consumed until this point. The UVvis spectrum (Fig. 5(a)) agreed with the previously reported spectrum of SiW, t039Mn(II1) [13]. Then the potential was increased to 1.25V, and the complex was electrolyzed at this potential until no further change of the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 5(b)) did occur. An addional net consumption of 0.99 F/mot was observed. Thus, at 0.85 V the Mn(IlI) complex was generated by a one-electron oxidation and at 1.25 V the Mn(IV)(OH) complex was formed by a second one-electron oxidation. 226 3.4. Electrochemical behavior of SiW11039Mn in the solution The consolidated peaks in the cyclovoltammogram of S'W1~039Mn(II)(H20)6- in the potential region between 0 V and 1.3 V versus Ag/AgCI can be explained quite easily by the following two reactions: K'W11039Mn(II)(H20)(6-n)- =Kn-1S^ 1039Mn(111)(H2O)(s n)-+e- + K+ (E1/2 = 0.53 V at pH 6.0) Kn-1S^ 1039Mn(III)(H2O)(5-n)- = Kn-1SIW11039Mn(IV)(OH)(5-n)-+e- +H' (E1/2 = 0.99 V at pH 6.0) Both redox steps are quasi-reversible one electron processes. In the Mnu/lll step, the loss, respectively the uptake of a potassium cation forming an ion-pair is involved as indicated by the dependence of the potentials on the concentration of potassium cation. In the second step, for the MnIn/Iv-pair, one proton is involved as shown by the linear dependence of the peak potentials on the pH. Thus, the Mn(IV)-hydroxy species is obtained by anodic oxidation in aqueous buffer solution as has also been reported previously [ 11 ]. The Mn(V)-oxo species, however, could not be generated under these conditions. For the shift of the peaks in the cyclovoltammogram during continuous scanning, several explanations are possible beforehand. For example, a change of the activity of the electrode surface must be taken into account. This can be excluded, however, because after the consolidated peaks have been obtained by continuous scanning, we stirred the solution for 15 min without touching the electrode, and received practically the same current-voltage curve as in the first scan. The activation of the electrode surface should, however, not have been altered to such an extent by this procedure. Secondly, the series of cyclovoltammograms during scan- M. Sakane, E. Steckhan /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 221-228 -~j Fig. 6. Digital simulation: the initial complex A is converted to a different complex B in the course of the experiment. If the heterogeneous electron transfer rate is different for A and B, the conversion from A to B is accompanied by a shape change of the cyclic voltammogramm, showing clear isosbestic points. A = B + e, E,/2 = 0.525 V, ks = 0.0001 (cm/s), a = 0.7; C = D + e, E1/Z = 0.525 V, k, = 0.001 cm/s, a = 0.7 DA = DB = Dc = Do, [A] + [B] = 1.0 mM. ning clearly show `isosbestic' points (Fig. 2), which indicates that one compound is continuously transformed into one other compound during this process (Fig. 2). From the shape of the voltammograms, it can be deduced that for the initial redox system, the heterogeneous electron transfer rate is considerably slower than for the redox system which is formed during continuous cycling, while the redox potentials are practically the same for both systems. (Digital simulation of this process using the DSim2.0 (Bioanalytic Systems, West Lafayette, IN) proves our assumption (Fig. 6).) The initial heterogeneous electron transfer rate seems to depend on the electrode surface pretreatment, thus explaining the low reproducibility of the first scan. Because scanning of the potential region of only the first redox pair does not result in a potential shift, it can be concluded that the transformation occurs on the Mn(IV) stage. We also have to include into our argumentation the fact that freshly prepared solutions of K6SiW11039Mn(II)(H20) in 0.5 M KH 2 P04 (pH 4.2) show a larger similarity with the consolidated peaks than those which we obtained after letting the solution stay for some time. In addition, similar effects are observed in the presence of other anions of the supporting M. Sadakane, E. Steckhan/Journal of Molecular Catalvsis A: Chemical 114 (1996) 221-228 electrolyte like perchlorate and acetate. Taking all this into account, we explain the potential shift during continuous scanning of the cyclo voltammogram by a ligand exchange reaction in the following way. At the beginning, the aquo ligand in the freshly prepared Mn(II) complex has been exchanged by the phosphate or other anions of the supporting electrolyte (L) in a slow reaction. The rate of this exchange reac tion is influenced by the concentration of the HP04 2- ion in the phosphate buffer solution, which is different for pH 4.2 and pH 6.0. These solutions differ in the concentration of the phos phate anion, H 2 P04 - and HP04 -. The higher concentration of Hp02- - in the solution of pH 6.0 caused a faster exchange of the aquo ligand (Fig. 1(b) and (c)) compared to the pH 4.2 solution. This can be seen in the cyclic voltam metry of a freshly prepared solution of the manganese heteropolyanion in pH 6.0 which already shows only the electrochemically slow redox pair in which the second anodic wave has shifted into the increase of the background cur rent. Thus, the following exchange reaction oc curred in solution (L: H,PO4'- or HP04-): KiW39Mn(II)(H20)(6-0-+ L = K,,SiW39Mn(lI)(L)(6 \")- + H20 This redox system (maybe together with small amounts of the aquo complex) shows the initial cyclovoltammogram in which the oxidation peaks are shifted to positive values. The oxidation of S'WH039Mn(III)(L)('-')- can almost not be distinguished from the background current of the electrolyte.

Therefore, by controlled potential electrolysis (at 1.25 V versus Ag/AgCl) the Mn(IV)(OH) complex is generated. The retransformation of the manganese(1V) phosphate system into the manganese(IV) hydroxy complex at the second oxidation step makes the S'W1,039Mn(IV)(OH)5-- system a promising candidate for the application as a mediator in indirect electrochemical oxidation processes. 3.5. Oxidative re actt,it_v of S^tO3y Mn(IV)(OH)5- The electrochemically generated Mn(IV)(OH) complex is slowly reduced to the Mn(III) complex at room temperature in the solution. Addition of alcohols to the solution accelerated this reduction. The Mn(IV)(OH) complex reacted with 1-phenyl-ethanol and produced the WHO complex and acetophenone (detected by gaschromatography), indicating that the manganese-substituted silicon tun gstoheteropolyanion can act as a catalyst for the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols. Fig. 7 shows the UV-vis spectra of the reaction mixture in the course of the reaction of the Mn(IV)(OH) complex with iso-propanol. The spectral changes of the reaction show clean isosbestic points and the UV-vis spectrum of the complex after complete reduction is in fact virtually identical to that of S'W,1039Mn(III).

Under pseudo-first order condition ([Mn] [alcohol]), the appropriate logarithmic kinetic plots were linear ( r > 0.9995), establishing first order kinetics in the concentration of Mn. The observed rate ( kobs) increased linearly with increasing concentration of iso-propanol (Fig. 8) and was independent of the pH of the solution. We compared the oxidation rate of some other alcohols in the pH 6.0 phosphate buffer at constant concentration of alcohols ([alcohol] = 0.1 M). The alcohols reacted with the Mn(IV)OH) complex in the fol- M. Sadakane, E.

Conclusion By means of cyclic voltammetry the electrochemical generation of SiW11039Mn(IV)(OH)5by oxidation of S'W,,039Mn(Il)(H2 0)6- was demonstrated. The electrochemically generated SiW11039Mn(IV)(OH)5- is able to oxidize alcohols. A detailed mechanistic study and the preparative electrolysis are under investigation.

The behavior of a manganese substituted α-Keggin silicon tungstoheteropolyanion (K6SiW11O39Mn(II)(H2O)) under electrochemical oxidation conditions was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry in phosphate buffer. Substitution of the water ligand by counter anions (L: H2PO− 4 or HPO2− 4) leading to SiW11O39Mn(II)(L) was observed. Replacement of the counter anion by an aquo ligand was observed in cyclic voltammetry by continuous cycling. After oxidation of SiW11O39Mn(II)(L) to SiW11O39Mn(IV)(L), this counter anion L was in turn substituted by OH−. The thus formed complex SiW11O39Mn(IV)(OH) oxidizes different alcohols, the reactivity of which decreases as follows: 1-phenyl-ethanol, benzylalcohol > iso-propanol > ethanol.
