G. BLACKMOND' AND E. I. Ko Department of Chemical Engineering, Carnegie-Melton University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 Received February 12, 1985; revised June 17, 1985 The surface structure of a series of Ni/SiO; catalysts was probed by CO adsorption and H;/CO coadsorption using quantitative chemisorption measurements and IR spectroscopy. Preparation method, pretreatment conditions, and metal crystallite size were found to affect the nature of the metal surface for crystallites in the range 2.5-9.0 nm. CO was found to adsorb in linear, bridge, and multiple-CO forms on these supported nickel catalysts. Multiple-CO adsorbs on \"defect sites\" of low coordination, which increase in number as the heterogeneity of the nickel surface increases. On large crystallites exhibiting a large fraction ofbridge-CO adsorption, coadsorption of hydrogen aided in probing the types of surface planes present on the crystallites. A high frequency peak in the bridge-CO region was assigned to twofold bridge-CO on Ni(lll) while a low-frequency peak was assigned to two- or fourfold bridge-CO on Ni(lOO) planes. The coadsorption of H; also resulted in an increase in the intensity of the peak for CO adsorption on defect sites, possibly due to increased dipole-dipole interactions between linear and subcarbonyl CO species. CO and CO/H; adsorption were found to be sensitive probes for both surface smoothness in terms of the presence of defect sites and surface structure in terms of the types of planes exposed. 1985 Academic press, inc. INTRODUCTION The adsorption of CO on small supported metal crystallites can be an elegant probe of their surface structure. Ever since the infra- red spectroscopic work of Eischens et al. (1, 2) in which separate IR peaks were as- signed to adsorbed CO in linear and bridge forms, there has been a wealth of experi- mental work involving CO adsorption on a variety of transition metals (3, 4). An excel- lent review of IR spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption on metal catalysts through the mid-1970's was made by Sheppard and Nguyen (3). While these studies reveal the rich chemistry of CO adsorption on sup- ported metals, they also show some incon- sistencies, including at times large differ- ences between CO spectra from seemingly similar samples. The heterogeneity of sup- ported metal crystallites poses significant ' Present address: Department of Chemical and Pe- troleum Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pitts- burgh, Pa. 15261. problems in attempts to compare differ- ently prepared catalysts. The nature of the metal surfaces is often not sufficiently un- derstood to explain the spectral differences observed in IR studies of CO adsorption. The objective of this paper is to show that careful IR studies of CO adsorption on supported metal catalysts may be combined with results from other characterization tools and with literature results for well-de- fined single-crystal surfaces to provide a better understanding of the nature of the metal surface structure of supported crys- tallites. A series of Ni/SiOz catalysts was prepared by different methods and charac- terized by a battery of chemical and physi- cal techniques (5). Infrared spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption and H2/CO coad- sorption were used to probe the surface of the supported nickel crystallites. Combined with results from quantitative H2 and CO chemisorption measurements, these studies demonstrate how the surface structure of heterogeneous nickel crystallites is related 210 0021-9517/85 $3.00 Copyright 1985 by Academic Press.

EXPERIMENTAL The preparation of the Ni/SiOz catalysts is described elsewhere (5). Briefly, cata- lysts with a range of crystallite sizes from 2.5 to 9.0 nm were prepared either by incip- ient wetness impregnation with nickel ni- trate hexahydrate or by a precipitation method using a nickel nitrate hexammine so- lution (6). Catalysts were dried in air over- night at 353 K after preparation and were stored in a desiccator until use. Reduction times and temperatures varied for each cat- alyst, but all were completed in flowing Hz at 50 cm^min after a temperature ramp of 10 K/min to the desired temperature. Re- duced samples were evacuated at 10\"6 Torr and 773 K for 1 h prior to adsorption mea- surements. Catalyst descriptions, including weight loadings and reduction conditions, are given in Table 1. Metallic weight load- ings were confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Static chemisorption measurements were made in a conventional glass volumetric ap- paratus equipped with a precision pressure gauge (Texas Instruments) and a diffusion pumping system capable of 10~6 Torr vac- uum. Hz adsorption isotherms were per- formed at room temperature, taking the to- tal uptake and using a stoichiometry of 1:1 for Hads: Nis (7) for crystallite size determi- nations. For CO, desorption isotherms were performed at 195 K where little ten- dency for gaseous carbonyl formation has been found (8). A second isotherm was per- formed after a pumping period of approxi- mately 1 h to remove weakly held CO, and the difference between the two isotherms was taken as the equilibrium adsorbed amount. For both Hz and CO, the equilibra- tion time for the first point on each isotherm was 15 h, and subsequent points were al- lowed 1-2 h for equilibration. Isotherms were performed in the pressure range 100- 400 Torr. Infrared spectroscopic measurements were made using a Digilab FTS-15C FTIR spectrometer. A glass gas-handling system capable of achieving a 10 ^-Torr vacuum was used for sample pretreatment and ad- sorption of gases. The quartz IR cell used was a conventional T-shaped cell (9) with separate zones for heating and for taking spectra. The sample holder was equipped with a quartz-encased magnet for ease of sample movement between zones. Nad windows were used. Spectra were collected by coadding 100 scans at a resolution of 8 cnr1 and referencing against a spectrum of the freshly reduced Ni/SiOz catalyst. Self- supporting sample wafers were prepared by pressing approximately 20 mg of sample un- der 500 psi (3.4 x lO^ kPa) to form a disk about 18 mm in diameter. IR spectra of CO adsorption were made after dosing small amounts (< 1 Torr) of CO on the catalyst at ambient temperature. Formation of gas- eous Ni(CO)4 was not observed at these low pressures. Crystallite size determinations from X- ray diffraction measurements were made using the line-broadening technique (10). A Rigaku D-Max spectrometer with a Mo source allowed crystallite size measure- ments to about 3 nm. Magnetic measure- ments were made using a Cahn Magnetic Susceptibility System capable of fields up to 10 kOe (7/). 212 BLACKMOND AND KO TABLE 2 Metal Crystallite Sizes (nm) Catalyst H, CHEM XRD Magnetic A-30 9.0 Cl-20 6.0 4.5 4.0 A-8 6.0 6.0 4.5 A-18 5.5 4.5 C-20 2.5 <3.0 2.5 RESULTS The preparation and characterization of the catalysts used in this study (with the exception of sample A-18) was discussed in detail previously (5, 8), and pertinent results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in Table 2, both preparation method and reduction conditions affect the crystallite size of the catalysts. By varying preparation method and time and tempera- ture of reduction, catalysts with crystallite sizes ranging from 2.5 to 9.0 nm were pre- pared. Table 3 lists chemisorption results (after Ref. (8)) from CO and H2 isotherms for some catalysts. While the Hads:Nis ratio has been well established (7) to be 1:1, the stoichiometry of CO adsorption is more complex since different forms of adsorbed CO with differing stoichiometries may be present on the same catalyst. Study of the ratio of COads: Hads may suggest whether bridge or multicentered species (COads: Hads < 1) are more prominent than linear or multiple-CO species (COads: Hads sl). Comparison of COads: Hads ratios for the catalysts listed in Table 3 reveals that the ratio decreases as the crystallite size in- creases. The results also show that crystal- lite size is not the only factor in determining the COads: Hads ratio. While the metal crys- tallites of both catalysts A-8 and Cl-20 are near 6 nm, their COads: Hads ratios differ sig- nificantly. Reduction conditions may also play a part, since the Cl-20 catalyst was reduced under more rigorous conditions 2300 2100 1900 1700 WAVENUMBERS(cm\"l) FIG. 1.

This phenom- enon is attributed to a larger COads: Nis stoi- chiometry on the A-8 catalyst since the results of Table 2 confirm that there is no significant suppression of hydrogen chemi- sorption on any of the catalysts. Figure 1 shows IR spectra of CO adsorp- tion at ambient temperature on four re- duced Ni/Si02 catalysts. Three prominent peaks in the CO stretching region of the IR spectrum are observed for all catalysts. A peak centered near 1950 cnrr' was found for all catalysts and is assigned to bridge-CO.

The spectrum obtained for CO ad- sorption on A-18 is indentical to that for A- 8, which is not shown. Two peaks of varying relative intensities are found in the linear-CO stretching region for all four catalysts. These peaks are cen- tered at 2040 (LF peak) and 2080 (HF peak) crrr'. As the metal crystallite size increases from 2.5 to 9.0 nm, the relative prominence of the LF peak increases from a small shoulder on the HF peak to a peak of com- parable or slighly greater intensity than the HF peak. The relative intensity of the total linear-CO region compared to that of the bridge-CO region also varies with metal crystallite size, becoming less prominent as the crystallite size increases. The HF lin- ear-CO species is weakly held on the sur- face and may be substantially removed by brief evacuation at ambient temperature. The other peaks are unchanged by this evacuation. Preparation method and pretreatment as well as metal crystallite size have an effect on the spectra of CO adsorption on this se- ries of catalysts. The spectra of Figs. Ib and c are of catalysts with similar crystallite sizes. However, the relative ratio of the HF/LF peaks is greater for the impregna- tion catalyst A-18 than it is for the precipi- tation catalyst Cl-20. As shown in Table 1, Cl-20 was subjected to more rigorous re- duction conditions than was A-18. This ob- servation may be compared with that made from the chemisorption results for cata- lysts A-8 and Cl-20. The impregnation cata- lyst with the higher COads: Hads ratio thus also exhibits a higher HF/LF peak ratio than does the precipitation catalyst of simi- lar crystallite size. While no CO or Hi che- misorption results are available for catalyst A-30, its IR spectra of CO adsorption and its crystallite size determined by X-ray dif- fraction support the trends observed for the other catalysts. When 100 Torr of Hz was contacted with catalysts with preadsorbed CO, spectra of the CO region as shown in Fig. 2 resulted. One major change in these spectra from those illustrated in Fig. 1 lies in the increase of intensity of the HF linear-CO peak rela- tive to the LF linear-CO peak. This change is present but not quite as pronounced for the 9-nm catalyst A-30 of Fig. 2a. For this catalyst, however, a marked change in the 2300 2100 1900 1700 WAVENUMBERStcm'I) FIG. 3.

The broad peak centered near 1950 cm\"' shifts down in frequency and separates into two distinct peaks near 1925 and 1880 cm-'. If, instead of adding H2 after CO adsorp- tion, H2 is preadsorbed prior to adsorption of 1 Torr of CO on these catalysts, spectra such as those shown in Fig. 3 are obtained. Prior to CO adsorption, the catalysts were cooled in Hz following reduction and evacu- ated briefly at ambient temperature to re- move gaseous and weakly held hydrogen, leaving strongly held hydrogen on the sur- face. In the linear-CO region, the HF peak is again sharp and prominent for all four catalysts. In the bridge-CO region, distinc- tion between separate peaks in the broad absorption band is again most visible for the 9-nm catalyst. The relative importance of the total bridge-CO region with respect to the total linear-CO region increases with crystallite size as for CO adsorption on the bare surface. DISCUSSION Both the quantitative chemisorption measurements and the IR spectroscopic studies reveal intriguing differences among the Ni/SiOz catalysts employed in this study. The results suggest that prepara- tion method, metal crystallite size, and pre- treatment procedures play a significant role in determining the surface structure of sup- ported nickel crystallites. Chemisorption Results Chemisorption results revealed COads/ Hads ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 for different catalysts. In the absence of gaseous nickel carbonyl formation, COads/Hads ratios greater than 1 imply the adsorption of more than one CO molecule on a single Ni sur- face atom. These results were discussed previously (8). These multiple-CO species were assigned to subcarbonyl adsorption on \"defect\" sites. It was found that prepara- tion method, pretreatment, and crystallite size influenced the stoichiometry of CO ad- sorption on these catalysts. For a given crystallite size of nearly 6 nm, the sample prepared by precipitation and reduced un- der rigorous conditions (Cl-20) exhibited less subcarbonyl adsorption than did cata- lysts with similar crystallite sizes prepared by impregnation. It was suggested that the high-temperature reduction treatment re- quired to sinter the precipitation catalyst Cl-20 to nearly 6 nm caused a \"smoothing\" or annealing of the nickel surface that elimi- nated \"defect\" sites necessary for adsorp- tion of multiple CO molecules. Hence sub- carbonyl adsorption was attributed not only to low-coordination nickel atoms found on small crystallites as an intrinsic characteris- tic of their size, but also to highly uncoor- dinated \"defect\" sites which can be found on heterogeneous crystallites which have not undergone a surface smoothing treat- ment. IR Spectroscope of CO Adsorption The IR spectra of CO adsorption on bare nickel surfaces show interesting trends both for crystallite size and for preparation method. While the peak for bridge-CO at 1950 cm~1 does not appear to change signifi- cantly in shape with these variables, the two peaks in the linear-CO region are influ- enced, as is the overall ratio of linear/bridge intensity, by both crystallite size and method of preparation. The IR peak at 1950 cm\"' representing bridge-CO is broad for all catalysts. This peak is probably the com- bination of two or more unresolved peaks. One possibility to explain the broad bridge-CO peak is that CO may be adsorbed on different crystal planes, and on each plane there are different bridging configura- tions. The frequency of two-fold bridge-CO should increase from Ni(lOO) to Ni(lll) since Ni atoms in the higher density Ni(l 11) plane have fewer J-electrons available for backbonding than do the more uncoordina- ted nickel sites in (100) and other crystal planes (3). However, (111) planes afford the possibility of bridging CO in three-fold sites which would lead to lower frequencies HZ/CO COADSORPTION ON SUPPORTED Ni 215 than are found for twofold bridge-CO on either plane. In addition, a fourfold site for bridge-CO found on (100) planes would pro- vide still lower frequencies (3). Examina- tion of the spectra in this light leads to the suggestion that the broad bridge-CO peak for all four catalysts is due mainly to two- fold bridge-CO sites with smaller amounts of three- and fourfold bridge-CO sites com- prising the asymmetric low-frequency side of the peak. The ratio of the intensities of the bridge- CO region to the linear-CO region increases with crystallite size. As the small crystal- lites grow in size, they may form metal sur- faces with more long-range order, capable of providing more sites for bridge-CO ad- sorption. In the linear-CO region, two peaks ap- pear which vary in relative intensity with particle size and preparation method, as al- ready mentioned. The LF peak at 2040 cm\"' has been attributed, in accordance with results for CO adsorption on single- crystal nickel planes (12-15), to linear-CO adsorption on planar sites typical of (100) or (110) planes. The assignment of the HF peak near 2080 cm~1 is less straightforward. An IR peak near 2080 CUT' has been ob- served in previous studies of CO adsorption on nickel. Yates and Garland (76) and Gar- land et al. (77) attributed the peak to CO weakly adsorbed on \"amorphous\" nickel, meaning sites with highly disordered struc- ture and incomplete nearest-neighbor coor- dination. Rochester and Terrell (18) also found that the CO species assigned to HF linear peak was weakly adsorbed, but their studies of sulfur poisoning of nickel sur- faces led them to suggest the peak is due to multiple coordination of CO on a single nickel atom to form a subcarbonyl species. Bouwman and Freriks (79) and Heal et al. (20) have also suggested that a HF peak of this type be assigned to a subcarbonyl sur- face species. Primet et al. (21) suggested that the weakly held HF linear-CO peak could be attributed to CO adsorbed on nickel atoms in contact with unreduced nickel residues, with the electronegative character of the oxide phase withdrawing electrons from the M-CO linkage and hence weakening the adsorption and shift- ing the IR frequency upward. Comparison of the IR spectra in Fig. 1 with COads/Hads ratios from chemisorption measurements in Table 3 reveals that the HF linear-CO peak increases as the COads/Hads ratio increases. This suggests that the HF linear-CO peak be assigned to a subcarbonyl species, in agreement with the results of Rochester and Terrell (18). Hence, the IR results for CO adsorption support CO chemisorption measurements which indicate that in- creased subcaronyl adsorption occurs as the nickel crystallite size decreases. The catalysts whose IR spectra are shown in Figs. Ib and c have similar crys- tallite sizes and yet the HF/LF ratio is greater for the impregnation catalyst A-18 than for the precipitation Cl-20 catalyst. Again, this trend parallels that found for COads/Hads ratios for Cl-20 and A-8 in Table 3, with the greater COads/Hads ratio ob- served for the impregnation catalyst. The IR results therefore support the suggestion that the number of \"defect sites\" on which the subcarbonyl species forms is smaller on the 6-nm precipitation catalyst, which had undergone the rigorous reduction treatment and smoothing of the surface of the metal crystallites. The nature of the \"defect sites\" for sub- carbonyl adsorption is not well denned. Multiple CO molecules are weakly ad- sorbed on these highly uncoordinated sites. The defect sites appear to be due to the disordered structure of heterogeneous metal crystallites and could possibly be found at the junctions between surface planes, which should be greater in number than is expected for crystallites exhibiting ideal geometries. The 9-nm catalyst A-30 whose spectrum is shown in Fig. la exhibits a HF/LF linear- CO ratio slightly smaller than that of the 6-nm catalysts Cl-20, even though A-30 received a less rigorous reduction or 216 BLACKMOND AND KO surface-smoothing treatment. The spectra of Fig. 1 also reveal that the bridge-CO peak for A-30 is a much more dominant fea- ture of the CO spectrum than is the bridge- CO peak for Cl-20. The significantly larger size of the crystallite of A-30 produced by impregnation suggests that these crystal- lites have more extended smooth planes than are found either on impregnation cata- lysts of smaller crystallite size or on the surfaces of rigorously reduced precipitation catalysts. These infrared and chemisorption studies support suggestions made in other studies (18, 22) that subcarbonyl adsorption de- creases with increasing crystallite size. The results reported here suggest further that this trend should more specifically be attrib- uted to increasing surface smoothness rather than simply increasing crystallite size. Application of group theory (23) to spec- troscopic studies of molecules adsorbed on surfaces indicates that a dicarbonyl species adsorbed on a single metal atom ought to have two infrared-active vibrations, a high- frequency symmetric and a lower fre- quency asymmetric vibration. Spectra of this type were found by Yates and co-work- ers (24, 25) for multiple-CO rhodium(I) spe- cies. However, the present results for nickel catalysts indicate that only the 2080- cm~1 peak is involved in subcarbonyl for- mation, since changes in this peak after var- ious treatments are not accompanied by parallel changes in any other peaks for ad- sorbed CO. It may be possible to explain the absence of the asymmetric component of the sub- carbonyl vibration by calling on an infrared \"metal-surface selection rule\" described by Pearce and Sheppard (26). If a dipole such as a CO molecule is situated above the surface of a conducting medium such as a reduced metal crystallite, it will produce a virtual-image dipole in the metal surface. The dipole change for the parallel vibrating molecule is cancelled by the image dipole change, while the dipole changes for the molecule and its image dipole reinforce each other in the perpendicular case. Hence, only dipole changes perpendicular to the surface of a perfect conductor should be infrared active. For the case of a dicar- bonyl species absorbed on a reduced metal surface, the lower frequency asymmetric vibration will be infrared inactive as long as the twofold axis of the species is perpendic- ular to the metal surface. This metal-surface selection rule may be expected to hold rigorously only in cases where the metal surface may be considered perfectly conducting, or perfectly polariz- able. If the surface atoms are oxidized or if the crystallite size becomes very small, then the complete cancellation of parallel dipole/image dipole contributions may not be expected. Metal crystallites in the size range 2.5-9 nm such as those studied here would be expected to follow this selection rule. The absence of an asymmetric stretch- ing CO vibration cannot in itself rule out the existence of an adsorbed subcarbonyl on these nickel surfaces. As mentioned before, Primet et al. (21) suggested from their infrared results of CO adsorption on similar Ni/SiQi catalysts that the HF linear-CO peak was due to CO ad- sorbed on nickel in intimate contact with unreduced nickel oxide residues. The cata- lysts whose spectra are shown in Fig. 1 all exhibited 100% reduction to the metal ex- cept for the catalyst C-20 whose spectrum is shown in Fig. Id, which was 70% re- duced. This catalyst also exhibits the larg- est relative intensity of the HF linear CO peak, and yields a COads/Hads ratio greater than 1 from chemisorption measurements. This implies some carbonyl formation on the C-20 catalyst surface. But if this adsorp- tion occurs on partially reduced nickel, the \"perfect conductor\" requirement for the surface-metal selection rule (26) is no longer met, and the out-of-phase asymmet- ric vibration of the subcarbonyl should be- come infrared-active. This lower frequency vibration is not observed, suggesting that the unreduced portion of the nickel surface Hz/CO COADSORPTION ON SUPPORTED Ni 217 does not affect the CO adsorption signifi- cantly. In fact, the unreduced portion may consist of a hydrosilicate \"glue\" layer be- tween the support and the nickel, as has been suggested previously (5, 27, 28), and hence does not affect the oxidation state of the metal crystallites. IR Spectroscopy ofH^/CO Coadsorption Hydrogen has a striking influence on CO adsorption on nickel catalysts for both the different preparation methods and the dif- ferent crystallite sizes investigated. One important feature is the increase in inten- sity of the 2080-cm-' HF linear-CO peak compared to the rest of the CO spectrum. This effect is noted for all catalysts, al- though in differing degrees for different crystallite sizes. The bridge-CO species may also be altered by the presence of hy- drogen. The broad bridge-CO band splits into two fairly well-separated bands in the spectrum of CO adsorbed on the catalyst with the largest crystallite size, the 9-nm A- 30. Significantly fewer investigations have been made of the coadsorption of CO and Hi on metal surfaces than have been made of CO adsorption alone. In infrared studies ofNi/SiOz and Ni/Alz03 catalysts, increases in HF linear-CO intensity similar to that ob- served in the present study were found by Primet and Sheppard (29) and by Galuzska and Amenomiya (30). A similar HF peak in the CO spectrum for adsorption of CO on Ni/SiOz in the absence of Hz was previously explained (27) by suggesting interaction of nickel with oxide residues, as discussed earlier in this paper. This led Primet and Sheppard (26) to suggest that the upward shift in CO frequency in the presence of Hz was due to the electron-attracting power of adsorbed Hz, which causes a shift of metal flf-electrons to adsorbed hydrogen and hence weakens the metal-CO bond. Another perspective concerning the ori- gin of the HF linear-CO peak and its behav- ior in the presence of hydrogen may be ob- tained from the vibrational spectroscopic results for CO adsorption on single crystals of copper by Hollins et al. (31). They attrib- uted an unusual high-frequency peak in the linear-CO region to adsorption on defect sites of low metal coordination on a slightly misoriented Cu(llO) crystal. They also as- serted from isotopic dilution studies that the intensity of the HF linear-CO peak was enhanced significantly above its true value due to strong dipole-dipole coupling effects between CO on defect and planar sites. In fact, a large fraction of the absorbance of the HF linear-CO peak was accounted for in terms of these dipole interactions. It was shown that a very small number of defect sites were responsible for large coupling- induced intensity increases in the HF lin- ear-CO peak. Dipole-dipole interactions of this type have been discussed before, mani- fested as changes in relative intensities and frequencies of IR peaks with surface cover- age or concentration of one isotope (32, 33). Interpretation of the present infrared results for CO adsorption in terms of these suggestions implies that at least part of the intensity of the HF linear-CO is due to strong dipole-dipole interaction between multiply adsorbed CO molecules on the de- fect sites and linear CO molecules on planar sites, even in the absence of Hz. This effect is greatly enhanced in the presence of hy- drogen. Apparently hydrogen may adsorb in such a fashion as to increase coupling between CO on planar and defect sites. This may occur by crowding of the planar CO species into different binding configura- tions so that they become closer to the plane junctions where the defect sites are most probably located. The number of CO molecules involved in a coupling interac- tion of this sort may be quite small and still promote the significant intensity increase that was observed here for the HF linear- CO in the presence of hydrogen. The de- gree of the coupling interaction increases with the heterogeneity of the crystallites and the fraction of defect sites present. The effect that hydrogen has on the 218 BLACKMOND AND KO bridge-CO region of the spectrum for A-30 may suggest that the large crystallites are comprised of extended crystal planes of dif- ferent types, and that H2/CO interactions are different on each plane. Comparison of these coadsorption results with those from studies of single crystal surfaces may pro- vide a way to distinguish between the dif- ferent crystal planes found on the heteroge- neous surfaces of the supported nickel crystallites. Some pertinent conclusions drawn from single-crystal results of CO and CO/H2 adsorption are outlined in the fol- lowing paragraphs. These conclusions have led us to assign the HF bridge-CO peak at 1925 cm-' in Figs. 2a and 3a to CO ad- sorbed on Ni(lll) planes and the LF bridge-CO peak at 1880 cnr\" to CO ad- sorbed on Ni(lOO) planes. The nature of CO adsorption has been found to differ on Ni(lOO) and Ni(lll) sur- faces (72-75, 34, 35). On Ni(lll), the CO stretching frequency was found to increase with coverage in a nonlinear fashion, indi- cating a change in CO adsorption sites from threefold to twofold as 0 increased (34, 35). A parallel decrease in the adsorption en- ergy (35) led to the conclusion that the ma- jor cause of the frequency shift was due to changes in the degree of backdonation of electrons into the ITT* antibonding orbitals of CO. On Ni(lOO), vibrational spectra of adsorbed CO appear to be more complex. The adsorption energy for CO was found to remain relatively constant with increasing coverage (72) and was higher than that ob- served on Ni(lll). This implies a lower vi- brational frequency for CO on Ni(lOO) than on Ni(lll) when in fact experimental results (14) show the opposite for the bridge-CO region. Doyen and Erti (36) have shown theoretically that d should reflect primarily the extent ofbackbonding; hence, the anomalous vibrational frequency se- quence rco(lOO) > rco(lll) must be ex- plained in terms of other factors. One such factor may be differences in the importance of CO dipole-dipole interactions for each crystal face. The high frequency for CO found on Ni(lOO) may be due to a greater interaction between CO dipoles on this crystal face. These ideas are supported very well by CO/H2 coadsorption studies by White and coworkers (37, 38) which help to complete our picture for the surface structure of the A-30 catalyst. White and co-workers (37, 38) found differences in the coadsorption of CO and H2 on Ni(lOO) and ?(111) single crystals. It was suggested from these and other results (39) that intimate mixing oc- curs in the coadsorption on Ni(lOO) sur- faces while on Ni(lll) separate islands of CO and H2 exist on the surface. Adsorption of CO/H2 at low temperatures (where cov- erage is likely to be comparable to that achieved in our higher pressure studies of supported Ni) revealed no shift in the bridge-CO peak for Ni(lll) in the presence of H2, while the main bridge-CO peak on Ni(lOO) shifted from 1955 to 1885 cm-' in the presence of H2. This frequency shift agrees well with our results for the LF bridge-CO peak of A-30 in the presence of hydrogen. These results taken together sug- gest that this shift may be due to the relaxa- tion of lateral dipole interactions between CO molecules by the intimately mixed ad- sorbed hydrogen. To summarize the findings of these stud- ies of CO and CO/H2 adsorption on single crystal surfaces, it appears that the fre- quency of bridge-CO on Ni(lll) is rela- tively unaffected by H2, while bridge-CO species on Ni(lOO) exhibit a large downshift in frequency under these conditions, caus- ing the relative frequencies to change to ^co(lll) > vco(^00) as predicted by mea- surements of energy ofdesorption (35). The frequency of CO adsorption on Ni(lOO) planes appears to be quite sensitive to the extent of dipole-dipole interactions be- tween CO molecules which can be greatly influenced by the presence of hydrogen inti- mately mixed with CO. For these reasons we have assigned the HF bridge-CO peak at 1925 cm-' for catalyst A-30 in Figs. 2 and 3 to bridge-CO (twofold) on Ni(lll) planes Hz/CO COADSORPTION ON SUPPORTED Ni 219 and the LF bridge-CO peak at 1880 cm-' to bridge-CO (possible a mixture of two- and fourfold) on Ni(lOO) surfaces. A small amount of threefold bridge-CO on Ni(lll) might be indicated by the low-frequency tail of the bridge-CO peak, but probably does not make a significant contribution at the high CO coverages likely under the condi- tions of these adsorption experiments. Hence, the peak shift and separation which occurs in the IR spectrum of CO in the presence of hydrogen on A-30 may be attributed to differences in the way bridge- CO species on different crystal planes re- spond to HZ/CO coadsorption. The signifi- cantly larger fraction of bridge-CO species on catalyst A-30 compared to the other cat- alysts may explain why this effect is pro- nounced mainly for this catalyst in the se- ries. A-30 may possess a higher degree of extended planes for bridge-CO adsorption, a condition necessary for observation of the effect of hydrogen on these species. Hz/CO coadsorption studies employing increasing amounts of \"CO would be very useful in exploring the effect of hydrogen coadsorp- tion by helping to probe which peaks (and hence, which crystal planes) are more strongly influenced by dipole-dipole inter- actions (33, 40). The high-frequency bridge-CO peak for the large crystallite size A-30 catalyst is much more dominant than is the rest of the bridge-CO region in the IR spectrum of CO in the presence of hydrogen on this cata- lyst. The assignment of this peak to adsorp- tion on Ni(lll) planes supports reaction results (41) suggesting a relationship be- tween increased crystallite size and in- creased proportion of Ni(lll) planes on supported nickel crystallites. Indeed, com- parison of CO/Hz reaction results from our laboratory (42) on catalysts A-30 and the small particle size C-20 show significantly higher selectivity to C^ hydrocarbons for A-30. Several recent studies on supported Pd systems have also used CO adsorption as a probe of the surface structure of the metal crystallites (43-46). Results from Pd single- crystal studies were called upon by Hicks et al. (43, 44) and to characterize CO peaks in the bridge-CO region according to the fraction of Pd(lOO) and Pd(lll) planes present on supported crystallites. Palazov et al. (46) suggested that changes in the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Pd/AlzOs after various treatments were due to reconstruc- tion of the Pd surface in the presence of Hz. These studies along with our own results illustrate the use of careful adsorption stud- ies as a promising tool for achieving a better understanding of the surface structure of supported metal crystallites. CONCLUSIONS Quantitative chemisorption measure- ments and IR spectroscopic studies have been used to probe the surface structure of a series of Ni/SiOz catalysts with crystallite sizes in the range 2.5-9.0 nm. Preparation method, reduction treatment, and crystal- lite size were all found to affect the nature of CO adsorption on these catalysts. CO adsorbs on nickel crystallites in bridge form and linear (LF) form on surface planes, and in multiple-CO (HF) form on defect sites. The defect sites are most prob- ably found at the junctions between trun- cated surface planes on these many-fac- eted, heterogeneous crystallites. The relative intensity of the HF subcarbonyl peak in the IR spectrum of CO adsorption depends on the degree of surface heteroge- neity, and may also be augmented by di- pole-dipole coupling interactions with the planar LF linear-CO species. Coadsorbed Hz has the effect of increasing these inter- actions, possibly by pushing linear-CO spe- cies into closer proximity to the defect-site CO. The effect of the addition of hydrogen on CO adsorption was suggested to depend on the type of plane exposed on the crystallite surface. On very large crystallites, whose CO spectra exhibit a large bridge/linear CO intensity ratio, HZ/CO interactions are man- ifested as a split and shift of the bridge-CO 220 BLACKMOND AND KO peak. The HF bridge-CO peak is assigned to twofold bridge-CO on Ni(lll) while the downshifted LF bridge-CO peak may be due to two- or fourfold bridge-CO on Ni(lOO) planes. These results illustrate how the surface structure of small supported nickel crystal- lites may be probed by studying CO adsorp- tion and HZ/CO coadsorption on the metal surfaces. As a general conclusion, it ap- pears that CO peaks above 2000 cm\"' on supported nickel act as a sensitive probe of the degree of surface smoothness, that is, of the presence of defect sites. The CO re- gion below 2000 cm\"' can be a probe for the type of crystal plane exposed if the crystal- lites are large enough to have extensive smooth planes. This study helps to increase the sophistication of our understanding of the nature of these heterogeneous Ni/SiOz catalysts. It is hoped that this development of a better picture of the surface structure of supported nickel crystallites may ulti- mately enable predictions about their cata- lytic behavior to be made on a more scien- tific basis.

Ko Department of Chemical Engineering, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 USA 1 Present address: Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15261. The surface structure of a series of Ni SiO2 catalysts was probed by CO adsorption and H2 CO coadsorption using quantitative chemisorption measurements and IR spectroscopy. Preparation method, pretreatment conditions, and metal crystallite size were found to affect the nature of the metal surface for crystallites in the range 2.5–9.0 nm. CO was found to adsorb in linear, bridge, and multiple-CO forms on these supported nickel catalysts. Multiple-CO adsorbs on “defect sites” of low coordination, which increase in number as the heterogeneity of the nickel surface increases. On large crystallites exhibiting a large fraction of bridge-CO adsorption, coadsorption of hydrogen aided in probing the types of surface planes present on the crystallites. A high frequency peak in the bridge-CO region was assigned to twofold bridge-CO on Ni(111) while a low-frequency peak was assigned to two- or fourfold bridge-CO on Ni(100) planes. The coadsorption of H2 also resulted in an increase in the intensity of the peak for CO adsorption on defect sites, possibly due to increased dipole-dipole interactions between linear and subcarbonyl CO species. CO and CO H2 adsorption were found to be sensitive probes for both surface smoothness in terms of the presence of defect sites and surface structure in terms of the types of planes exposed.

        "dc:description": "The surface structure of a series of Ni SiO2 catalysts was probed by CO adsorption and H2 CO coadsorption using quantitative chemisorption measurements and IR spectroscopy. Preparation method, pretreatment conditions, and metal crystallite size were found to affect the nature of the metal surface for crystallites in the range 2.5–9.0 nm. CO was found to adsorb in linear, bridge, and multiple-CO forms on these supported nickel catalysts. Multiple-CO adsorbs on “defect sites” of low coordination, which increase in number as the heterogeneity of the nickel surface increases. On large crystallites exhibiting a large fraction of bridge-CO adsorption, coadsorption of hydrogen aided in probing the types of surface planes present on the crystallites. A high frequency peak in the bridge-CO region was assigned to twofold bridge-CO on Ni(111) while a low-frequency peak was assigned to two- or fourfold bridge-CO on Ni(100) planes. The coadsorption of H2 also resulted in an increase in the intensity of the peak for CO adsorption on defect sites, possibly due to increased dipole-dipole interactions between linear and subcarbonyl CO species. CO and CO H2 adsorption were found to be sensitive probes for both surface smoothness in terms of the presence of defect sites and surface structure in terms of the types of planes exposed.",
