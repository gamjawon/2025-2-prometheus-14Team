Tel: +86-411-84379070; Fax: +86-411-84694447 Using FFC-Cambridge Process to prepare Si from SiO2 is a promising method to prepare nanostructured and highly pure silicon for solar cells. However, the method still has many problems unsolved and the controlling effect of the cell voltage on silicon product is not clear. Here we report in this article that nano cluster-like silicon product with purity of 99.95% has been prepared by complete conversion of raw material SiO2, quartz glass plate, using constant cell voltage electrolysis FFC-Cambridge Process. By analysis of XRD, EDS, TEM, HRTEM and ICP-AES as well as the discussion from the thermodynamics calculation, the morphology and components of the product based on the change of cell voltage are clarified. It is clear that pure silicon could be prepared at the cell voltage of 1.7–2.1 V in this reaction system. The silicon material have cluster-like structure which are made of silicon nanoparticles in 20–100 nm size. Interestingly, the cluster-like nano structure of the silicon can be tuned by the used cell voltage. The purity, yield and the energy cost of silicon product prepared at the optimized cell voltage are discussed. The purity of the silicon product could be further improved, hence this method is promising for the preparation of solar grade silicon in future.

Key words silicon nanostructures molten salt electrochemistry solar grade Si FFC-Cambridge Process 1 Introduction FFC-Cambridge Process is an electrochemical reduction process in molten salt, which has been applied to realize the preparation of many metals or semi-metals from their oxides [1,2]. It has many advantages such as low device cost, relative low reaction temperature, controllable carbon dioxide emission and in process controlling, etc. Using FFC-Cambridge Process to prepare silicon from SiO2 is believed as a promising route to prepare silicon nanomaterial and solar grade silicon [3,4]. Generally, the Si preparation through this Process is in this way: SiO2 fixed on current collector works as cathode in a molten salt (in most cases, CaCl2) electrolyte; the electrodeoxidation (electrolysis) take place when negative electrical potential is operated on cathode and silicon is produced on it. On the other hand, oxygen anions move to the anode through molten salt to produce oxygen (on noble metal) or carbon dioxide (on carbon electrode). Some nanostructured silicon materials such as silicon nanowires [5,6] or micrometer-sized prismatic pillars [7] have already been prepared. The purity of the silicon has already reached 99.80%, when the process was combined with melting treatment [8]. However, there are still many basic things of this Si preparation process not clear. First, it seems that the SiO2 is difficult to be converted completely [9,10]. As a result of this, the product is a mixture of product and unreacted SiO2. SiO2 is difficult to be separated out which hampers the utilization of the product. Second, the oxygen content of the product is not analyzed and controlled clearly [9,10], which makes the purity of the product doubtable. Third, the morphology of the as-prepared material has not been inspected systematically. The main reason for these may be that the precise electrochemical control is not easily to realize. It is difficult to find a longlife stable reference electrode in this molten salt system, thus controlling the potential precisely in a long period and producing the sample reproducibly are not easy. Other adverse impacts are impurities [11], components changing in the salt [11], and side reactions [12], etc. All these bring difficulties on controlling the reaction as well as analyzing the product. Herein we report that by controlling experiment parameters precisely, the constant cell voltage electrolysis of FFC-Cambridge Process could be realized and a series of pure nano silicon can be prepared reproducibly with the complete conversion of raw material SiO2. Products obtained by different cell voltage electrolysis have been clearly characterized. According to thermodynamics analysis, the evolution of the products has been discussed. The purity of the product is very high and has the potential to improve. 2 Experimental The FFC-Cambridge Process was carried out on a self-made lab-scale molten salt electrolysis apparatus, which is similar to the ones reported in literatures [11,13,14]. The counter electrode was graphite crucible (ash 0.005%, 1.8 g/cm3) with inner diameter of 50 mm. Working electrode was composed of rectangle quartz glass plate (ZS-2 grade, China) of which the size was 20 × 10 × 0.5 mm. Two pieces of nickel nets (99%, 20 mesh) worked as holder and current collector, and molybdenum wires (99%) were used to fix the electrode. About 220 g CaCl2 (analytical grade, Sinopharm, China) was used to form a 50 mm deep molten salt. The experiment was operated at 850 °C under the protection of argon atmosphere. Electrochemical reduction reaction was conducted according to the constant cell voltage electrolysis method by a Parstat 263A potentiostat/galvanostat. After the reaction, the sample was cooled down in the furnace and then transferred out. After washing with water and removing of nickel nets and molybdenum wires, the sample was washed by dilute hydrochloric acid and dried. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku Rint D/MAX-2500/PC at 40 kV × 30mA with a scan rate of 5°/min (2θ). Transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) was conducted on FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) was carried out on FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was monitored by the EDS accessory (Ametec Quanta 200 FEG 132–10) in SEM (FEI Quanta 200F). The data was measured under the 2000 or 5000 magnification and each datum was the average value of more than 5 results test from different part of samples. ICP-AES test was conducted on Shimadzu ICPS-8100. Before test, the sample was dissolved by acids according to the literatures from Li et al. [15] and Song et al. [16]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and components of the product Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples prepared at different cell voltages. As can be seen from it, in the cell voltage range of 1.7–2.4 V, the main product from the electrolysis are silicon and the diffraction patterns are all in accordance with the pattern of Si (JCPDS#27-1402). XRD patterns of the samples prepared at the cell voltage below 2.3 V show no other peak. However, when the cell voltages of 2.3 V and 2.4 V are used, other patterns such as Mo2C (JCPDS#35-0787) appeares in the XRD patterns of the product, indicating impurities present in these samples. The impurities probably come from the side reactions, which happen in higher cell voltage electrolysis. The electrochemical reduction reaction could not take place when a cell voltage is set below 1.7 V. When the cell voltage is above 2.4 V, the product is grey-black solid which reacts violently with water, showing that the main product is not silicon. So the range of the cell voltage was restricted to 1.7–2.4 V in this paper. Based on the three strongest peaks in the XRD patterns, the crystalline grain sizes of the produced silicon are estimated by Scherrer Equation. The grain size increases firstly then decreases as the cell voltage goes up, as displayed in Figure 2 . Samples prepared at the cell voltage of 1.9–2.1 V have grain size of ∼ 250 Å, while for those prepared at 1.7 V or in the range of 2.2–2.4 V, the grain size is smaller. This should be relevant to the mechanism of the growth which will be discussed later in this article. Table 1 lists the components of the samples analyzed by EDS accessory in SEM. The samples prepared at the cell voltage of 1.7–2.1 V have the oxygen content of lower than 3% in atomic ratio, and no other impurities could be detected. Considering that silicon material is always covered a thin layer of SiO2 on the surface when it has been stored in air or washed by water, these EDS results prove that pure silicon have been prepared in the electrolysis at the cell voltage of 1.7–2.1 V. On the other hand, the samples prepared at the cell voltage of 2.2 V, 2.3 V and 2.4 V have oxygen content of 7.2%, 29% and 43% in atomic ratio, respectively. The oxygen content goes higher as higher cell voltage is used, which could be attributed to the side reactions and the forming of Ca-Si compounds. As shown in Equations (a) and (b), CaSi and CaSi2 have been confirmed in the literatures [9,17]. These Ca-Si compounds react with water to form SiO2 (as shown in Equations (c) and (d)), resulting in high oxygen content product. This mechanism is also supported by the experimental phenomenon in the washing process. Samples prepared at the cell voltage of 2.2–2.4 V have react violently with water during the washing process. As the cell voltage rises up from 2.2 V to 2.4 V, the intensity of the reaction is enhanced and the reaction time last longer. (a) SiO 2+ + Ca 2 + 6e − = CaSi + 2 O 2 − (b) SiO 2 + 2 Ca 2 + 8e − = CaSi 2 + 2 O 2 − (c) CaSi + 4 H 2 O = Ca ( OH ) 2 + SiO 2 + 3 H 2 ( g ) (d) CaSi 2 + 6 H 2 O = Ca ( OH ) 2 + 2 SiO 2 + 5 H 2 ( g ) Besides oxygen, the samples prepared at higher cell voltage contents other impurities and the impurities content goes higher as the cell voltage increases. The components of the other impurities were also analyzed and the results are presented in Table 2 . Among the impurities, carbon may come from graphite crucible or carbonate reduction. Other impurities may come from current collector (Ni, Mo), containments in the salt (Mg, Mn, etc) and the molten salt (Ca, Cl). In summary, although the main crystalline product is silicon, the product contain a considerable number of SiO2 and other impurities when the used cell voltage was equal to or higher than 2.2 V (under the experimental condition herein). Thus these cell voltages are not suitable for the preparation of pure silicon. In previous report, cell voltage equal to or above 2.4 V was used for silicon preparation [10]. XRD patterns showed silicon is the only product, but oxygen content of the products were not given. From XRD and EDS results herein, it can be concluded that a relative higher cell voltage is not conductive to the preparation of high pure silicon. TEM images are shown in Figure 3 . The six samples are all composed of nanoparticles with irregular shape and different sizes. One common feature of all these samples is that these nanoparticles are all connected with adjacent ones forming cluster structure. Interestingly, these six samples are different from each other in details. Samples prepared at the cell voltage of 1.7 V, 1.9 V and 2.1 V are all nanoparticles with dense, uniform thickness and smooth surface. Nano clusters prepared at 1.7 V cell voltage have loose but long branches. As the cell voltage goes higher from 1.7 V to 2.1 V, the number of branches increases and the length of one branch decreases. This phenomenon could be explained by the electrochemical reaction-growth mechanism [5]. During the reaction, fresh silicon nano particles will attach on the previously formed silicon nanoparticles, and become the new current conductor and the growth sites to the latter formed silicon. As a result, the silicon particles are all connected together with the adjacent ones. Because the growth of the structure is non-structure-directed, the clusters are of no regular shape. The particle size is usually 20–100 nm, which reveals that silicon particles are stable and no longer grow after generation. From TEM images it also can be seen that relative large porosities present around these clusters. It can be estimated that when SiO2 (quartz glass) is completely converted to Si, the shrinkage of the volume is 44%. However, in the experiment we noticed that after the complete conversion of SiO2, the volume was not shrunk apparently. Although the porosity is not measured, this porosity structure of the nanocluster silicon is corresponding to the unchanged volume of the electrode after the reaction. The different morphology of these samples could be caused by the different reaction rate. When the cell voltage is low, the reaction rate is also low and there are a small amount of growth sites of the silicon. Thus the number of branches is small and each branch could grow long. When the cell voltage is relative high, the reaction rate is accelerated and a large number of silicon growth sites exist. Thus the number of branches is large and one branch could not grow very long. When the cell voltage is above 2.2 V, the surface of the nanoparticles become rough. From TEM image of sample prepared at the cell voltage of 2.3 V, it can be seen that nanoparticles are not dense and small pores appear on the particles. Rough surface and ring-shaped structure of nanoparticles appears in the sample prepared at 2.4 V cell voltage. These structure features are in accordance with the deduced effect from Ca-Si compounds. The rough surface should be attributed to the amorphous SiO2, which is produced through the Reactions (a)–(d). The component and detailed structure is further clarified by HRTEM Inspections in Figure 4 . The samples prepared at the cell voltage of 1.7 V and 1.9 V have similar structure, i.e., pure crystalline silicon with an amorphous oxide layer of 1–2 nm on the surface. Sample prepared at the cell voltage of 2.1 V has a little thicker oxide layer. However, samples prepared at the cell voltage of 2.2 V, 2.3 V and 2.4 V have oxide layer of 4 nm, 6 nm and 10 nm on the surface, respectively. Moreover, the sample prepared at the cell voltage of 2.3 V does not exhibit clear or continuous lattice, and the sample prepared at 2.4 V only exhibits small and discontinuous lattice. In these two samples, amorphous structure are not only present on the surface but also inside of the particles, which is generally consistent with the oxygen contents results analyzed by EDS. It has been reported that the well-designed nano silicon with large porosity exhibits very impressive performance as anode material in Li-ion batteries [18–21]. This 3D cluster-like pure silicon material which have tunable branching structure and large porosity would have potential application in Li-ion batteries. 3.2 Mechanism of the reactions in the process Possible reaction equations and corresponding standard Gibbs free energy as well as the equilibrium potentials in the progress are shown in Table 3 . The over-potential value for CO2 emission on the graphite anode is deduced to be relative large, but the exactly number is not known [14]. Nevertheless, because the anode reaction are all emission of CO2 [14] (as shown in Equations 1, 2, 4–6, 10 and 11), the over potentials on anode of these reactions are the same. As a result, the calculated value of equilibrium potential could be used to evaluate the relationship of the cell voltages needed for these reactions. One more factor needs to be considered for the analysis of thermodynamical calculation is the activity (or concentration) of CaO in molten CaCl2. CaO could dissolve in CaCl2 as high as 17 wt% and it is difficult to measure CaO content in the salt. Three values of CaO activity, 0.02, 0.1 and 1 are used to calculate the thermodynamic data, which covers the possible range of the real value. Luckly, although the Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium potential values of one reaction are different based on these three different CaO activity value, the relative relationship is the same. Thus the qualitative conclusions can be deduced from the analysis easily, which are as follows: 1) CaSiO3 is generated which causes the loss of SiO2 The silicon is generated through Reaction 2, of which the cell voltage demand is the lowest in the system. However, according to the Gibbs free energy calculation, Reaction 3 is spontaneous. Because trace amount of CaO is originally existed in the salt, and O2– (equivalent to CaO) will be also produced by the cathode electrochemical reduction of SiO2, CaO will react with SiO2, leading to the dissolution of SiO2 and the generation of CaSiO3. This conclusion was also experimentally proved by Xiao et al. [12] and Pistorins et al. [14]. Although as shown here, CaSiO3 could be consumed according to Reactions 4 and 8–11, some CaSiO3 still stay in the salt. CaSiO3-CaCl2 could be detected by XRD in the powder collected from the molten salt electrolyte after reaction (not shown here). The generation of CaSiO3 will cause the loss of SiO2 and can result in the low yield of silicon. 2) Side reactions exist in the low cell voltage reaction According to Equations 5 and 6, the voltage needed for the generation of CaSi and CaSi2 are only less than 0.1 V higher than that of Si generation. Because some extent of overpotential is needed to force the reaction take place at a certain rate, the practical cell voltage used for the silicon preparation could also be capable to drive the generation of CaSi and CaSi2. Although the side reactions happen in the low cell voltage electrochemical process, the Ca-Si compounds do not exist in the product in the experiment. Yet the real mechanism is not proved, two possible reasons are guessed to be responsible for the low content of Ca-Si compounds in the product: (a) the generation rate for Ca-Si compounds is possibly not very high; (b) Ca-Si compounds could be consumed through Reactions 7–9. Thus pure silicon could be prepared as the final product at the low cell voltage range (1.7–2.1 V in this paper). 3) In high cell voltage electrochemical process, byproduct suppression is difficult. In a high cell voltage reaction, Reactions 10 and 11 will take place. Ca-Si compounds generated through Reactions 5 and 6 will proceed violently. As a result, a large number of CaSi compounds will present in the product accompanied with silicon. After washing, amorphous SiO2 present in the final product. The generation of Ca-Si compounds not only competes with the preparation of Si in the experiment, but also consumes the as-prepared silicon in the reaction process (as shown in Reaction 7). Therefore, the grain size of the silicon produced at high cell voltage is smaller. In brief, controlling of cell voltage is very important for the preparation of silicon in FFC-Cambridge process. Pure silicon product can be prepared via a relative low cell voltage electrolysis. Too high cell voltage electrolysis causes byproducts. Considering that the low cell voltage causes slow reaction rate, the applicable cell voltage range for preparation of silicon in this reaction system is 1.9–2.1 V. 3.3 Purity, yield and energy cost of silicon produced at the optimized cell voltage In order to verify the purity of silicon product exactly, ICP-AES test was conducted on the sample prepared at the cell voltage of 2.1 V. Eight kinds of possible impurities were analyzed, as summarized in Table 4 . It is a pity that the C and O content could not be given through ICP-AES. While according to the EDS data C and O content are very little in the product, we exclude these two elements in the statistics herein. Comparing with the impurity content in the raw material quartz glass, the contents of impurity elements are all higher. But the overall impurity content is less than 500 ppm, which means the purity of silicon could reach 99.95% (without consideration of C and O). The impurities should come from the molten salt and the electrolysis apparatus in the experiment which are not confined strictly to impurities (graphite crucible and metal current collector are not highly pure, CaCl2 is only of 96% purity). Thus it is hopeful that the purity of silicon product could be further improved in future. Because the quartz glass is pure enough (generally SiO2>99.99%, some with B and P content of less than 1 ppm), if one can diminish the impurities from the reaction system to a low level, the solar glade pure silicon is hopefully producible by this one step electrochemical reduction process. According to the weight of the collected silicon product from several reactions at the cell voltage of 2.1 V, silicon yield is calculated as 32.5%, far less than the theoretical value 100%. Considering that the loss in washing and transferring, the actual yield of the reaction should be higher. The dissolution of SiO2 (forming CaSiO3) could be one of the reason to result this low yield. Calculated by the amount of silicon product and the actual electrolysis power consumption, the energy cost (electrolysis only) for silicon preparation is 27.2 kWh/kg, which is much higher than that reported before [4,10]. If the calculation is based on the consumption of SiO2 (the dissolution part is included) as the previous report did, the energy cost is 8.84 kWh/kg, which is close to the reported result. But this is not the real energy consumption value for the process on the harvest of silicon. Further discussion will be given in other report. 4 Conclusions Pure silicon product has been prepared by completely electrochemical reduction of quartz glass plate using constant cell voltage electrolysis method. Effect of the cell voltage on the purity of the product and the structure of the product has been studied. It is clear that pure silicon could be prepared at the cell voltage of 1.7–2.1 V in this reaction system. These silicon materials have cluster-like structure which are made of silicon nanoparticles in 20–100 nm size. Interestingly, the cluster-like nano structure of the silicon product could be tuned by the used cell voltage. Cell voltage higher than 2.1 V is not suitable for silicon preparation because of high content of oxygen and other impurities in the product. A purity of 99.95% silicon product can be obtained by electrolysis at 2.1 V cell voltage according to ICP-AES analysis. The yield of silicon product is 32.5% and the energy cost is 27.2 kWh/kg Si. These nanocluster silicon materials have the potential to be available as anode material in Li-ion batteries. Because the purity of the product could be improved, this method is also promising for the preparation of solar grade silicon in future.
