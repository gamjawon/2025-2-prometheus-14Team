As a result, isotactic polypropylene (PP) has been obtained whose meso-meso (mm) triad sequence content is greater than 92% as demonstrated by \"C NMR spectroscopy, and whose molecular weight is comparable to that for commercially produced PP. The GPC curves for PP exhibit a remarkable change in shape depending on the polymerization temperature leading to ones which clearly exhibit separate bimodal shapes. The microstructure and melting point of PP have also been investigated. Introduction Since the discovery of a highly active soluble catalyst system com- posed of a zirconocene compound and methylaluminoxane (MAO) [I], exten- sive studies have been undertaken in this field [2 -12]. It has been reported that isotactic polypropylene (PP) (71% content of meso-meso triad sequence) was obtained by using soluble ethylene bis(l-indenyl) titanium dichlo- ride, Et(Ind)2TiCl2, possessing a sterically rigid ligand [13]. More highly isotactic polypropylene was prepared using soluble Et(Ind)aZrCl2 or its hy- drogenated compound [14 -16] and, in addition, with the analogous hafnium compounds, isotactic PP having a high molecular weight was obtained [17,18]. This paper reports studies of the influence of the polymerization temper- ature on the catalyst activity, the microstructure and molecular weight of the polymers produced in propylene polymerization with an Et(Ind)aHfCl2/MAO catalyst system. In addition, the results obtained have been compared with those obtained in propylene polymerization using the corresponding Zr cata- lyst system. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 238 Experimental Preparation of EtfInd^HfCl^ To a 200 ml glass flask equipped with a stirrer, 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 5.4 g of l,2-bis(l-indenyl)ethane [Et(Ind>2], prepared by the method of Marechal and Lepert [19], were added and the system cooled to 40 C. Then, 31.5 ml of n-butyl-lithium (1.6 mol 1~1 solution in hexane) was added dropwise over 30min keeping the temperature at 30 C to 40 C, and then continuing the stirring for 1 h at 30 C. As a result, the dilithium salt of Et(Ind)g was obtained. Next, 60 ml of THF was placed into another 200 ml glass flask and cooled to below 60 C. Subsequently, 6.7 g of hafnium tetrachloride(HfCl4) containing 0.78 wt.% zirconium, as purchased from Aldrich, was added slowly to the THF. After such addition, the system was heated to 60 C and stirred for 1 h at this temperature to dissolve the HfCLi. The dilithium salt prepared as above was then dropped into the HfCl4 solution over a period of 30 min. After stirring at 60 C for 2 h, the resulting solution was filtered at 60 C to remove precipitated LiCl. The resulting filtrate was then concentrated to ca. l/5th its volume to precipitate a yellow solid. Ethylene bis(l-indenyl) hafnium dichloride (Et(Ind)aHfCl2) containing 0.40 wt.% Zr was obtained by washing the solid compound with hexane and drying in vacuo at room temperature. When used as a polymerization catalyst, Et(Ind)2HfCl2 was employed as the toluene solu- tion (Hf = 3.0 mmol I-1). Preparation of methylaluminoxane (MAO) MAO was prepared according to the previously reported procedure [11] and used as the toluene solution (Al = 2.1 moll\"1) in the polymerization experiments. Polymerization of propylene Toluene (500ml), 3 mol propylene and the prescribed amount of the toluene solution of MAO were placed at room temperature in a 21 stainless- steel reactor equipped with a stirrer. The system was cooled or heated to the polymerization temperature and then the prescribed amount of the toluene solution of Et(Ind)2HfCl2 added. Polymerizations were carried out for 0.5 or 4 h over the temperature range 30 C to 50 C and terminated by the addition of a small amount of methanol. The resulting products were poured into a large volume of methanol and washed with a mixed solution of hydrochloric acid and isobutanol. The resulting polymers were collected by filtration and vacuum-dried for 12 h at 80 C. 13 C NMR spectroscopic analysis A polymer solution was prepared by dissolving ca. 150 mg of the polymer sample in a mixture of 0.5 ml hexachlorobutadiene and 0.1 ml deuterioben- zene at 120 C. \"C NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL GX-500 spectrometer operating at 125.65 MHz with proton noise decoupling in the 239 Fourier transform mode. Measurement conditions were as follows: pulse angle, 45 ; pulse repetition, 4.0 s; spectral width, 8800 Hz; number of pulses, 36 000 - 64 000; temperature, 95 -110 C; data points, 64 k. GPC analysis The molecular weights of the polymer samples were determined by GPC methods (Water Associates model/ALC/GPC/150C) using polystyrene gel columns (106 -103 A pore size) and o-dichlorobenzene as the solvent at 140 C. DSC analysis DSC analyses were undertaken using a Perkin Elmer-7 differential scanning calorimeter. Calibration of the instrument was performed by measure- ments of the melting points of indium and lead. The sample weight employed was co. 2.5 mg and a heating rate of 10 C min~1 was used in all the runs. Results and discussion Propylene polymerizations were performed over the temperature range -30 C to 50 C with a catalyst system composed of Et(Ind)2HfCl2/MAO and the results obtained were compared with those for the corresponding Zr catalyst system [20]. The catalyst activity per unit hafnium depended largely on the polymerization temperature, e.g. the observed activity of 23 200 g PP(mmol Hf) -1 at 50 C fell to 8 g PP(mmol Hf) -1 at -30 C. The polypropy- lenes thus produced were analyzed by GPC, ^C NMR and DSC methods, the results obtained being listed in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1 depicts the \"C NMR spectrum of PP(run 1). This spectrum exhibits a number of irregular peaks similar to those from Zr-catalyzed PP [20]. These were assigned [21] to peaks based on head-to-head or tail-to-tail linkages (which may be further subdivided into m and r types as shown below) and the (CH2)4 unit arising from 2,1-insertion and 1,3-insertion of propylene monomer, respectively, which are not observed for PP generated from TiCIa or MgClg-supported Ti catalysts [22 - 24]. These peak assignments are listed in Table 3 and Fig. 1.

Correlation between melting point (Ty,) and mm values for Zr-catalyzed PP (0), Hf-catalyzed PP (A) and MgClz-supported titanium-catalyzed PP ( ). where I denotes the sum of the intensities of each peak resonance at 41.94, 43.00 and 46.18 ppm for a,a-methylene carbon atoms, 30.24, 32.19, 35.22 and 35.66 ppm for a,/?-methylenes and 37.16 ppm for a,<5-methylenes. The results are listed in Table 2. The polypropylene arising from run 1 exhibited a 92.3% content of the meso-meso (mm) triad sequence, sufficiently high to be defined as isotactic PP. However, it should also be noted that the ratio for the m/r arrangement was 1.3, which is quite low and reveals the lack of isospecific control just after 2,1-insertion of the propylene monomer. As the temperature for polymerization decreased, the mm values in- creased slightly from 92.3% (50 C) to 94.6% (-10 C), while the frequency of 2,1- and 1,3-monomer insertion decreased significantly, especially for 1,3- monomer insertion which hardly occurred at polymerization temperatures below 20 C; consequently, the melting point (T^) increased from 132.6 C to 143.1 C. In Fig. 2, the Tni values of PP have been plotted as a function of the mm values to enable to comparison between the data for Zr- and Hf-catalyzed PP, and MgCIa-supported TiC^ -catalyzed PP [20]. It is seen that the relationship between T^ and mm values for the Hf system is consistent with that for the 244 50 C , , .- , 345 67 Log MW Log MW Log MW Log MW Pig. 3.

Zr system, although the T^ values are always 10 C or even 20 C less than those for the titanium catalyst system having the same mm values. The lower T^ values of PP observed with the Hf and Zr systems may be attributable to the existence of regio-irregular portions in the polymer chains. These results indicate that Hf- and Zr-catalyzed PP have virtually the same microstructure. The molecular weights (Mn) of PP obtained with the Hf system, in contrast to the Zr system, were comparable in magnitude to those for commercial samples of PP, with the exception of runs 6 and 7, as reported by Ewen [17, 18]. Figure 3 depicts an interesting change in the GPC curves for PP with the Hf system as the polymerization temperature was varied, an effect which was not observed with the Zr system. Thus, PP produced at 50 C produced a single peak in the GPC curve and the value of the polydispersit.y (M^/Mn) was 2.37 which is relatively narrow. At 30 C, a shoulder appeared on the low 246 molecular weight side of the peak and clearly separated over the range 20 C to 0 C, where a bimodal shape was observed. At even lower temperatures, and particularly below 10 C, the GPC curve changed to a single peak through disappearance of the peak on the high molecular weight side. These findings could be explainable by one of the following two reasons. Firstly, as a result of the existence of two types of Hf active site capable of producing polymers with different molecular weight. From changes in the area of the GPC curves, it is possible to state that the sites would exhibit different polymerization temperature dependencies for their activities, al- though the stereospecificities of both sites would be virtually the same since the mm values listed in Table 2 are hardly changed by changes in the polymerization temperature. The second possibility (probably the most plau- sible reason) is the contamination of the catalyst by a small quantity of the Zr compound (0.40 wt.% Zr was present in the examined Hf catalyst). In this case, the changes in the GPC curves may be explained by the possibility that the Zr compound produces lower molecular weight polymer although the amount of Zr-catalyzed polymer is negligible at higher polymerization tem- peratures. At lower polymerization temperatures, however, this amount be- comes comparable or even larger than that of the Hf-catalyzed polymer. If this were so, the area of the GPC curves indicates that the Zr compound would have to be more than 50-times greater in activity than the Hf com- pound at polymerization temperatures less than 0 C. This analysis suggests, therefore, that the examined Hf catalyst system is characterized by two types of active site with similar stereospecificities but with different kyfk^ ratios in the polymerization process, where kp is the propagation rate constant and k^ is the chain-transfer rate constant.

        "dc:description": "Propylene polymerizations have been performed using ethylene bis(1-in-denyl) hafnium dichloride containing a small quantity of a zirconium compound and methylaluminoxane as the catalyst system over the temperature range −30°C to 50 °C. As a result, isotactic polypropylene (PP) has been obtained whose meso-meso (mm) triad sequence content is greater than 92% as demonstrated by 13C NMR spectroscopy, and whose molecular weight is comparable to that for commercially produced PP. The GPC curves for PP exhibit a remarkable change in shape depending on the polymerization temperature leading to ones which clearly exhibit separate bimodal shapes. The microstructure and melting point of PP have also been investigated.",
