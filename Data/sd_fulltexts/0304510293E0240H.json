Deformation of a titanium chloride molecule and partial dissociation of an organoaluminO dimer have been shown to take place by approaching the two species together. A six membered cyclic intermediate complex has been formed in a reaction plane, involving the Ti atom, the C atom, two Al atoms, the Cl * atom and the bridging atom. An elongation of the C-Al bond, Al-bridging atom bond, the Ti-Cl* bond and shrinkage of the C-Ti bond take place in concert in the transition state region. Key factors of activating the complex are the valency of the titanium and the structure whether or not it has a Cl anion trans to the Cl* atom. An active site is the complex between the alkylated titanium chloride and the aluminum chloride produced in the course of the reaction. The formation of the active site in titanium chlorides/organoalOinO systems has been clarified to become easier in the following order: dl-Sq (square) pyramidal > d -Sq pyramidal > d -hinge like titanium chloride. d -triangle pyramidal titanium chloride is unfavorable for the formation of active sites.

Though the proposition that the active site is a metal (titanium)-alkyl bond has widely been accepted, only a limited number of studies on the alkylation of the titanium compounds with organoaluminum compounds have been reported so far [ 1 ] . Minaker et al. [ 2 ] reported a theoretical study on physical adsorption and succeeding chemisorption of organoaluminum compounds on the crystal surface of transition metal halides. They obtained the structure of the chemisorbed complex and suggested the important role of the alkyl-aluminum compound chemisorbed on the crystal surface of TiC13. However, the successive initiation step is still vague. Recent progress in computational methods with ab initio molecular orbital theory makes it possible to determine the potential energy profile of a full catalytic cycle [ 3 ] . However, from a practical point of view, ab initio calculation is not easy to do for such large catalytic systems as used in industry. Furthermore molecular orbitals are delocalized over the whole molecular frameworks in these systems. It is not easy to see the interactions between two large molecular systems. Fujimoto et al. [ 4 ] . proposed a method for determining unequivocally the orbitals which should play dominant roles in interactions between two systems. The interaction was represented compactly in terms of a few pairs of localized orbitals. In each orbital pair, one orbital belongs to one fragment species and the other orbital to the other fragment species. They called those orbitals \"paired interacting orbitals\" (PIO). Although this analysis was proposed originally for ab initio calculations, we reported that this approach was also useful in analyzing the results of extended Huckel calculations [ 5 ] . This method is particularly of use as a conventional tool to gain insight into the reaction mechanisms of large catalytic systems without invoking time-consuming calculations. Here we report a PIO analysis on the active site formation between titanium chlorides and alkylaluminums. Method The active site formation is schematically shown by equation (1) . TiCl,+[R,nAlCl3_,,]2-*RTiCln_1+Rm_lAlCl4_,n-R,nA1Cl3_,n (1) where R=H or alkyl. The model compounds which we employ here are (a) titanium chlorides: d and dl-sq pyramidal- [TiC15]\" (where n is -1 or -2) and d -modified-Td[ TiC14 ] and (b) organoaluminum compounds: [ H3A1 ] 2, [ H2AIC1 ] 2 and [ CH3 (H) AlCl - H2AlC1 ] . The geometries of these compounds are given in the Appendix. A. Shiga et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 243-262 245 We study the active site formation by the following procedures: (1) A reaction path has been determined by an ab initio calculation for the simplified molecular system ( [ TiCl6 ] -1 / [ H3AI ] 2) . (2) We have determined the model structure of the key states of the reaction described above by referring to the result of (1) . (3) We have calculated extended Huckel MOs of these states and obtained PIOs according to the procedure proposed by Fujimoto et al. Ab initio calculation We used the restricted Hartree-Fock energy gradient technique of GA USSIAN 90 for the geometry optimization [ 6 ] . The basis functions used for Ti were MID14 of Huzinaga et al. [ 7 ] for the 5F state, which were augmented by two sets of valence p functions (exponent= 0.083 and 0.028) with the overall splitvalence contraction (43321/4311/ 31). For C, H, Al and Cl atoms we used the 3-21G [8,9] basis functions. PIO analysis Molecular orbitals were calculated by the extended Huckel method [ 10 ] . The extended Huckel parameters are given in the Appendix. PIOs were obtained by applying the procedure proposed by Fujimoto et al. [ 4 ] . It is summarized as follows: (1) We expand the MOs of a complex in terms of the MOs of two fragment species, by determining the expansion coefficients cip cm+j,j and dkf, do+l,f in Eq.

PIO calculations were carried out on an LUMMOX system with NEC PC9801RA [ 11 ] . Results and discussion 1. Determination of a reaction path We employed a simplified model system: [Cl*TiC14] -1/ [H3A1]2. Four intermediates (Il-I4) were obtained by ab initio calculations of the system by assuming the Cs symmetry with respect to the plane composed of the Ti atom, Cl* atom and two Al atoms. The structure of the rest of the titanium chloride has been fixed. The structures obtained are shown in Fig. 1. The intermediate states (Il) and (I2) represent the complexes at an early stage of the reaction in which the HAI dimer retains its hydrogen bridge structure. Partial dissociation of the HAI dimer has taken place, standing for the A. Shiga et al. / J. Mol.

Catal. 87 (1994) 243-262 proceeding of the reaction. Then, the intermediate complex (I3) which has a six membered ring composed of Ti, H*, All, H, A12 and Cl*, is formed. The HOMO of the partially dissociated H3A1 dimer has a large amplitude on the H* atom and the LUMO of it has a large amplitude on the Ale atom. A remarkable change in the structure is observed on the stage in going from complex (I3) to complex (I4). In complex (I4) we see the formation of the Ti-H* bond and an elongation of the Ti-Cl* bond. Since the formally dissociated state (5) is very unstable, it is not appropriate to consider the state (5) as a final state. We explore next the route from complex (I3) to complex (I4) in detail by applying the PIO analysis. We assume here two routes to produce the active site. Route 1: the fragment H2All and the fragment molecule H-A12H2 roll out of the Cs symmetry plane toward the x -y plane. Route 2: the fragment H2All moves downward to approach the Cl* atom in the Cs symmetry plane and the fragment molecule H-A12H2 moves also downward in the Cs symmetry plane, keeping the coordination to the Cl* atom, in a cooperative manner. Then, the fragment HAP and the hydrogen atom of H-Ale roll out of the Cs plane toward the x -y plane. We assume also several model states along these routes by referring to the results of the ab initio calculation described above. The structure of the model (B) is illustrated in Fig. 2. The bond distances of Cl*-A12 (2.60 A), All 2-H (1.55 A) and the vertical distance between All and the x -y plane (2.30 A) are fixed. The distances between H* and All (Rl ), between H* and Ti (R2) and between Cl* and Ti (R3 ) and the rotation angles Ol and 02 are varied. The Huckel total energies of those models are summarized in Table 1. The total energies of the models B2 and B4 tell us that Route 1 is less favourable than Route 2. A relatively small energy barrier, less than 0.5 eV, is observed along Route 2. As the reaction proceeds, new bonds are formed between the H* atom and ,O H 2.3oA \\,~i ssA \\ ; e, I\\._______.______~e,l 2.sod Fig. 2. The structure of the model (B). A. Shiga et al. / J. Mol.

We divided the model complex B into two parts: one way is dividing complex B into the titanium chloride ( fragment D ) and the H*Al1H~ - H3A12 molecule (fragment E ), which correspond to the reactants. The other way is division into the hydrotitanium chloride ( fragment F ) and the H2A11C1 - H3A12 molecule (fragment G ) which correspond to the products. They are shown in Fig. 3. The geometry of the combined systems D and E and that of F and G are the same as those of the intermediate complex (B ) ( [D + E ] - [ F + G ] - (B )) . 250 A. Shiga et al. / J. Mot Catal. 87 (1994) 243-262 We follow the progress of the reaction by comparing the contour maps and overlap populations of the PIOs. Here we look at the top two PIOs (PIO-1 and PIO-2) that have much larger contributions to the interaction than the other orbital pairs. The contour maps of the PIO-1 and -2 between the fragment D and the fragment E and those between the fragment F and the fragment G in the intermediate complex Bl and in the intermediate complex B7 are shown in Fig. 4 and in Fig. 5, respectively. As for the definition of models B1 and B7, see Fig. 2 and Table 1. We see in-phase overlaps in the regions between the H* atom and the Ti atom, between the All atom and the Cl* atom and between the A12 atom and the Cl* atom (see Fig. 4.). These in-phase overlaps are stronger in complex B7 than in complex Bl. This indicates that new bonds are formed between that pair of atoms. We see also in-phase overlaps in the regions between the H* atom and the All atom and between the Ti atom and the Cl* atom (see Fig. 5. ). The in-phase overlap between the H* atom and the All atom is weaker, however, in complex B7 than in complex Bl. The bond between the H* atom and the All atom has almost disappeared. Thus, we estimate that complex B7 comes out in the neighborhood of the final stage of the reaction. We may confirm this result by comparing the overlap populations and the dissociation energies between the fragments D and E with those of the fragments F and G. These overlap populations and coordination energies are summarized in Table 2. PIO-2 C) Z L x Fig. 4.

The contour maps of the PIO-1 and PIO-2 between fragment F and fragment G, (a) the model Bl, (b) the model B7. Both the sum of the overlap populations of the PIO-1 and -2 and the coordination energies ( -dEl ) increase gradually on going from complex Bl to complex B7 in case of the division of (B ) into D and E. On the contrary, both the overlap populations and the coordination energies ( -dE2 ) decrease gradually on going from complex B1 to complex B7, in the case of the division of (B )into F and G. At the transition state, ( -dEl ) should be equal to ( -dE2 ). It is seen, however, that ( -dE2 ) is much smaller than ( -dEl ) at the complex state, B7. This means that the structural change takes place easily to give the product from complex B7. From the results described above, we conclude that the active site formation proceeds in the following steps (1) Deformation of a titanium chloride molecule takes place by interacting with an aluminum hydride dimer, (2) a complex is formed between the partially dissociated aluminum hydride dimer and the deformed titanium chloride, ( 3 ) the four main structural deformations, elongations of the H*-Ah bond, of the Ah-H bond and of the Ti-Cl* bond and a decrease in the distance between H* atom and a Ti atom, occur in concert, keeping Cs symmetry in the complex formed above, ( 4 ) and then, the fragment H2A11 and the fragment molecule H-A12H2 roll out of the Cs plane downward to their positions in the final product. A final product ( an active site ) should be the complex, [ HTiC14 HZA1C1 H3A1 ] _ . 2.

The suffix i represents the reaction systems: i=0; d -Sq pyramidal [TiC15]-1/[H3A1]2, i=1; d -Sqpyramidal [TiC15]-1/[HZAIC1]2, i=2; d -Sq pyramidal [TiClfi]-1/[CH3(H)AIC1-H2AlCl], i=3; dl-Sq pyramidal [TiClb]-2/[CH3(H)AlC1 H2AlC1], i=4; d -hinge like [TiC14]o/ [CH3(H)AIC1 H2AlC1] and i=5; d -trigonal pyramidal [TiC14]o/ [ CH3 (H) AlC1 H2AlCl ] . Their extended Huckel energies are summarized in Table 3. (TiCld-WHZAlC112 sy8tem Fig. 6 shows the energy of the intermediate states relative to the reactants (Ai0). Most of the intermediates, including Ail and Ai2, are unstable in comparison with the reactants, because their structures have not been optimized. The extended Huckel calculation may have some limitations to determine the energetics of a process involving bond breaking and formation. It is possible however to estimate whether or not a sharp and large change in energy (more than 1 eV) appears along the reaction path. Comparing the [ H2AlC1 ] 2 system with the [ H3Al ] 2 system, a relatively large amount of energy is necessary to reach Bll from All. The energy difference is due to the difference in the dissociation energies of the two organoaluminum dimers. Being activated to Bll, the energy profile going from Bll to A12 is flat and similar to that from Bol to Ao2. From a comparison of Fig. 7 (a) and (b) with Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 5 (a) respectively, we find that orbital interactions in Bl1, expressed by PIO-1 and -2, are very similar to those in Bol. The Bll state is rather closer to the final product state than Bol is. This is shown by the fact that the energy difference, -dE2- ( -AEl ), is smaller in Bll than in Bo1 (see Table 2). 254 A.

The A21 state is not so stable as Aol because of the ateric repulsion between the methyl group and the Cl atom that is located trans to the Cl* atom. A tilt of the methyl group in the Cs symmetry plane is necessary for effective coordination of the methyl group to the titanium atom in the neighborhood of the transition state. Since the dissociation energy of the methylaluminum compound is similar in magnitude to that of the [ H2AlC1 ] 2, it requires additional energy for the tilting of the methyl group to reach the transition region in the [ TiClb ] -' / [ CH3 (H) AICI - H2AIC1 ] system. The contour maps of the PIO-1 and -2 between the fragment (D) and the fragment (E) and those between the fragment (F) and the fragment (G) for B21 are shown in Fig. 9 (a) and (b), respectively. Orbital interactions shown in Fig. 9 (a) and (b) are basically the same as those shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b).

We have chosen the same six states along the reaction path as described in part 2. The extended Huckel energies are summarized in Table 3. The overlap populations, ( -dEl ) and ( -dE2 ) are given in Table 2. d1-(TiClsj-2/(CH3(H)AICI H2AlClJ system The energy profile of the system is shown in Fig. 8. In comparison with the d -system, it requires relatively less energy to reach the A1 state in the dl system. In the d system, the titanium chloride in A21 is leas stable than that in A20, because the Ti-Cl* bond in A21 has a Cl anion trans to Cl*. On the other hand in the dl-system, the SOMO energy ( -8.22 eV ) of the titanium chloride in A31 is more stable than that ( - 7.90 eV ) in A30. The instability of the titanium chloride in A31 is somewhat compensated by the stabilization of the SOMO in the dl-system. As shown in Fig. 10, orbital interactions in the dlsystem are basically the same as those in the d -system shown in Fig. 9, in the cx spin part. The coordination energies ( -dEl or -dE2 ) of the dl-system are smaller than those of the d -system because of the repulsion between the SOMO of the titanium fragment and the methyl group or the Cl* atom, as is expressed by A.

The methylation of the [TiC15] is more favorable in the dl state than in the d state. d -(TiCl4J /[CH3(H)AICl-H2AlClJ system Two structures of titanium chlorides are possible on complex formation, depending on the direction of attack of the aluminum compound. One is a hinge like structure in which a Cl anion is located trans to the TiCl* bond (Eq. 8) and the other is a trigonal pyramid in which no Cl ligand is located trans to the Ti-Cl* bond (Eq. 9 ).

Catal. 87 (1994) 243-262 Energy profiles of these systems are shown in Fig. 11. The A41 state is less stable than A61 because of the trans Cl anion effect in the hinge like structure of the titanium tetrachloride in A41. In the transition region [B], the methyl group approaches the Ti atom, while the Cl* atom leaves from the Ti atom. In the case of Eq. (8 ), the approach of the methyl group takes place easily because the trans Cl anion is absent. On the contrary, in the case of Eq. (9) the approach of the methyl group is not easy because of the trans Cl anion effect on the incoming methyl group and of the repulsion between two equatorial Cl anions and the methyl group. The absence of the trans effect on the Cl* atom in the approach (9) gives rise to a relatively large coordination energy ( -dE2) (see Table 2 ). It is suggested, therefore, that the methylation in the do-[TiC1410/ [CH3(H)AIC1-HZAICl] system occurs along the reaction path in which the titanium chloride has a hinge like structure. In comparison with the d - [TiC15 ] -1 system, it needs a considerably large amount of energy to reach A41 in the d - [TiC14 ] system, because the trans effect in the hinge like structure of the titanium chloride is stronger than that in the square pyramidal structure of the titanium chloride of A21.

Conclusion Active site formation of Ziegler catalysts schematically shown by equation (l') proceeds by the following steps: Cl*-TiCl,z + R,n, Al1X3 _,n - R,n A12X3 _ m ->R-TiCl,,+R,n_lAll(Cl)X3_m-R,nA12X3-,n W) R=H or alkyl, X=H or alkyl or Cl. (1) Deformation of the titanium chloride is initiated by an approach of an organoaluminum dimer, (2) a titanium complex is formed between a partially dissociated organoaluminum dimer and the deformed titanium chloride in a Cs symmetry plane, (3) the structural deformation of the complex, which includes elongation of the bonds between the organo group and the All atom, between the All atom and the bridged atom X and between the Ti atom and the Cl* atom and shrinkage of the bond between the organo group and the Ti atom, occur in concert, keeping the Cs symmetry, and (4) the complex is led into an active site. The dissociation energy of an organoaluminum dimer and the deformation energy of a titanium chloride are important for the formation of the titanium complex. Key factors controlling the activation of the titanium complex are the valency of the titanium and whether or not the complex has a Cl anion trans to the Cl* atom. As a result, the active site formation in titanium chloride/ organoaluminum systems becomes easier in the following order: trialkylaluminum dimer > dialkylaluminum chloride dimer, and dl-Sq pyramidal > d -Sq pyramidal > d -hinge like titanium chloride. It is natural to assume that the active site of the alkylated titanium compound is forming a complex with the aluminum compound, and the incoming olefin pushes off the weakly complexed aluminum compound to initiate the polymerization of the olefins.

Fax. (+81-298)644729 The mechanism of the active site formation in Ziegler polymerization catalysts has been studied using the paired interacting orbitals (PIO) based on an extended Hückel calculation. Deformation of a titanium chloride molecule and partial dissociation of an organoaluminum dimer have been shown to take place by approaching the two species together. A six membered cyclic intermediate complex has been formed in a reaction plane, involving the Ti atom, the C atom, two Al atoms, the Cl* atom and the bridging atom. An elongation of the CAl bond, Al-bridging atom bond, the TiCl* bond and shrinkage of the CTi bond take place in concert in the transition state region. Key factors of activating the complex are the valency of the titanium and the structure whether or not it has a Cl anion trans to the Cl* atom. An active site is the complex between the alkylated titanium chloride and the aluminum chloride produced in the course of the reaction. The formation of the active site in titanium chlorides/organoaluminum systems has been clarified to become easier in the following order: d1-Sq (square) pyramidal ⪢ d0-Sq pyramidal ⩾ d0-hinge like titanium chloride. d0-triangle pyramidal titanium chloride is unfavorable for the formation of active sites.

        "dc:description": "The mechanism of the active site formation in Ziegler polymerization catalysts has been studied using the paired interacting orbitals (PIO) based on an extended Hückel calculation. Deformation of a titanium chloride molecule and partial dissociation of an organoaluminum dimer have been shown to take place by approaching the two species together. A six membered cyclic intermediate complex has been formed in a reaction plane, involving the Ti atom, the C atom, two Al atoms, the Cl* atom and the bridging atom. An elongation of the CAl bond, Al-bridging atom bond, the TiCl* bond and shrinkage of the CTi bond take place in concert in the transition state region. Key factors of activating the complex are the valency of the titanium and the structure whether or not it has a Cl anion trans to the Cl* atom. An active site is the complex between the alkylated titanium chloride and the aluminum chloride produced in the course of the reaction. The formation of the active site in titanium chlorides/organoaluminum systems has been clarified to become easier in the following order: d1-Sq (square) pyramidal ⪢ d0-Sq pyramidal ⩾ d0-hinge like titanium chloride. d0-triangle pyramidal titanium chloride is unfavorable for the formation of active sites.",
