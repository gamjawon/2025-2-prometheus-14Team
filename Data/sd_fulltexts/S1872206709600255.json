Vapor Phase Synthesis of 3-Methylindole over a Ag/SiO 2 Catalyst ZHENG Jiacong, LIU Jing, TAN Wei, SHI Lei*, SUN Qi Institute of Chemistry for Functionalized Materials, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian 116029, Liaoning, China Abstract: Ag/SiO 2 was used as an efficient catalyst for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol at atmospheric pressure. When Ag/SiO 2 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h and the molar ratio of H 2 O to H 2 was 0.750 in the reaction, the yield of 3-methylindole could be up to 35%. X-ray diffraction characterization showed that the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst with silver crystallites was active for the synthesis of 3-methylindole. Key words: silver; silica; supported catalyst; aniline; 1,2-propanediol; 3-methylindole Indoles are widely used as intermediates in the production of herbicides, fungicides, dyes, corrosion inhibitor, etc. [1–5] and are important nitrogen-containing heterocyclic chemicals. Many indoles are obtained in liquid phase reactions, e.g., the well known Fischer synthesis. These, however, have many drawbacks such as complicated and expensive reagents, a large number of toxic solvents, heavy pollution, and rigorous reac- tion conditions [6–9]. The vapor phase synthesis of indoles, for economic and environmental aspects, is now also attractive. The 3-position of indole is the preferred site for electrophilic substitution reactions. 3-Alkyl or acyl indoles are versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of indole de- rivatives. There are many reports on the vapor phase synthesis of indoles [10,11], but only a few on 3-methylindole. Recently, Gopal et al. [12] reported the synthesis of 3-methylindole from indole and methanol using a CeHY zeolite catalyst. A 30% yield of 3-methylindole was obtained. Campanati et al. [13] developed a ZrO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst for the synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol. The yield of 3-methylindole was 12%. In this study, a Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was used for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol. The catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregna- tion. After impregnation of the support with the appropriate amount of nitrate aqueous solution for 12 h at room tempera- ture, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 4 h and calcined for 4 h to get the catalyst precursor. Prior to activity tests, 3 ml pre- cursor was reduced in a gas mixture of 25% H 2 and 75% N 2 at 120 °C for 1 h. The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed bed con- tinuous flow glass reactor with inside diameter of 12 mm at normal atmospheric pressure. Reactants and products were analyzed by an SP-6890 gas chromatograph using a SE-54 column. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance apparatus with a Cu K . source using a rate of 5°/min in the 2 range of 30°–60°. The voltage and the current were 40 kV and 100 mA, respectively. SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 are the common supports for the alkylation of aniline. Here, catalysts with different active components on these supports were investigated. The results are shown in Table 1. For the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst, the conversion of 1,2-propanediol was 98% and the selectivity for 3-methyl- indole was as high as 17%. Over the Ag 2 O/SiO 2 catalyst, both the activity and selectivity were lower than those over the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst. In the case of the Cu/SiO 2 and CuO/SiO 2 catalysts, the conversion of 1,2-propanediol was as high as 100%, but the selectivity for 3-methylindole was poor ( � 10%). Compared to the SiO 2 supported catalysts, the activity and selectivity were less over Al 2 O 3 - and SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -supported ZHENG Jiacong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1199–1201 catalysts. Of all the catalysts, the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was found to be an effective catalyst for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol. In general, big molecules of reactants, products, and by-products can adsorb on catalyst surface and form coke during reactions. Adding steam and hydrogen to a reaction can remove the coke on catalyst surface and enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Table 2 shows the results of changing the steam/H 2 molar ratio from 0 to 1 while keeping a nitrogen velocity of 40 ml/min and steam/H 2 mixture velocity of 40 ml/min. The conversion of 1,2-propanediol decreased with the increase of the steam/H 2 molar ratio. The selectivity for 3-methylindole first increased and then decreased. When the steam/H 2 molar ratio was 0.750, the selectivity for 3-methylindole was 37%. Table 3 gives the activity and selectivity of the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst after calcination at different temperatures. An obvious difference in activity and selectivity was detected. The con- version of 1,2-propanediol decreased with increasing calcina- tion temperature, however, the yield of 3-methylindole first increased and then decreased. When the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was calcined at 500 °C, the yield of 3-methylindole was 35%, which is considerably higher than the results reported in the literature [12,13]. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst treated at different calcination temperatures. Typical diffraction peaks of Ag(111) and Ag(220) can be seen for temperatures of 600 and 700 °C. These peaks were weaker for the temperature of 500 °C, and there was no peak for the temperature of 400 °C. That is, the intensity of the diffraction peaks for Ag increased with increasing calcination temperature. From the XRD pat- terns and activity data, it can be concluded that the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst with silver crystallites is active for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole. In conclusion, a Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was developed for the vapor phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from aniline and 1,2-propanediol at atmospheric pressure. A yield of 35% for 3-methylindole was obtained when the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h and the molar ratio of H 2 O to H 2 in the reaction was 0.750. XRD characterization showed that the Ag/SiO 2 catalyst with silver crystallites was active for the synthesis of 3-methylindole.
