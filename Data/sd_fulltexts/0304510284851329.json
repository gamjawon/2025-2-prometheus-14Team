FRAGALE, M. GARGANO, N. RAVASIO, M. ROSSI* and I. SANTO Dipartimento di Chimica, Universita degli Studi-Bari, Via Amendola 173, 70126 Bari (Italy) (Received July 8, 1983 .accepted October 5, 1983) Summary Palladium catalysts (Pd-on-C and Pd-on-7-Al203 ) and silver-modified palladium catalysts (Pd + Ag-on-C and Pd + Ag-on^-Al^Oa) were used for the hydrogenation of diolefins (Z-penta-l,3-diene, Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene and Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,5-diene) to mono-olefins. The activities and selectivities of these catalysts have been compared. Introduction The use of palladium and silver as a bimetallic catalyst for the hydro- genation of organic substrates has long been investigated. However, studies on mixed adsorption systems have been restricted to the hydrogenation of benzene [1 - 7] or to the semi-hy drogenation of acetylenes [8-11], whereas only a few patents deal with the hydrogenation of nitro compounds [12] and olefins [13]. Even more rare are reports on the catalytic properties of Pd-Ag alloys [14, 15]. In the hydrogenation of an aromatic ring, silver can act either as a pro- moter or as an inhibitor. In fact, by using Ag-modified Pd catalysts, incre- ments or decrements of activity have been observed which are correlated to the Pd:Ag ratio [1, 2, 5 - 7] and to the preparation procedure [3, 5, 6]; modifications of the original activity are interpreted in terms of changes in the number of active sites [4] and of electronic interactions [6]. In the selective semi-hydrogenation of acetylenes, the added silver seems to increase the life of the Pd-on-Al^Oa catalyst and to suppress the formation of byproducts [9]. Following our previous work on the catalytic hydrogenation of poly- enes [16 - 18], we have investigated some Pd-Ag systems with the aim to correlate activity and selectivity to the catalyst composition. In this paper *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 212 we describe the results obtained in the hydrogenation of a linear 1,3-diolefin having both terminal and internal double bonds, the Z-penta-l,3-diene, and two cyclooctadienes, one having conjugated double bonds, the Z,Z'-1,3- isomer, and the other having isolated double bonds, the Z,Z'-l,5-isomer. Two commercial palladium catalysts, 5% Pd-on-C and 1% Pd-on-7- AliOa, have been used for the experiments. Silver nitrate was deposited on these samples and then reduced to metal with Ha at 350 C. Modified cata- lysts having Ag:Pd ratios of 1 and 2 were prepared. Original and modified catalysts were used in the hydrogenation of the organic substrates under similar experimental conditions. Results and discussion Hydrogenation of Z-penta-l,3-diene The hydrogenation reaction of Z-penta-l,3-diene was carried out at 20 C in a magnetically stirred reactor (20 ml) connected to a mercury-sealed gas burette charged with H 2 at 1 atm. By using 5% Pd-on-C, 1% Pd-on-Al^, 5% Pd + 5% Ag-on-C or 1% Pd + 1% Ag-on^-Al^Oa as catalyst and with a substrate .'palladium molar ratio of 460 - 470 we found that the first mole of hydrogen was promptly consumed by the diolefin with rates of ca. 6 - 8 ml min\"1, whereas the second mole addition was ca. 8-12 times slower. Mate- rials having a Pd/Ag = 2 ratio proved to be almost inactive, as well as mate- rials containing only silver, 5% Ag-on-C and 5% Ag-on-'y-Al^. No attempts have been made to evaluate the activities with different substrate: catalyst ratios. The analytical composition (GLC) of the reaction products after addi- tion of one mol hydrogen per mol diene is reported in Table 1. Commercial Pd-on-C and Pd-on-7-Al203 show a quite different diene: monoene selectivity, which can be derived from the amount of pentane at the equivalent point. The results showed low selectivity with the first and high with the second catalyst. The composition of the monoene fraction is also different: Pd-on-7-Al203 produces a higher yield of the terminal isomer, TABLE 1 Molar percentage of products obtained from the hydrogenation of Z-penta-l,3-diene after addition of 1 mol H^ per mol diene' Catalyst Ag:Pd Pentadienes Pentane Pentenes Z-I.3 -1,3 1- Z-2 E-2 Pd-on-C 0 33 6 24 19 45 Pd+Ag-on-C 1 1.5 1.5 34 25.5 37.5 Pd-on-7-Al203 0 1-1 31 25 43 Pd + Ag-on-7-Al203 l 0.5 0.5 45 22 32 \"r = 20 C, PH, = l a1-\"1, [diene] = 1.7 M in methylcyclohexane, [Pd] = 3.7 X 10-3 M. 213 whereas Pd-on-C is a more efficient catalyst for the cis-trans isomerization because it gives a higher amount of .E-pent-2-ene and an accumulation of -l,3-diene. The catalyst doping caused by silver addition is kinetically not relevant for systems having a ratio Ag:Pd = 1, but it appears important owing to the modifications of the selectivity properties, especially in the case of carbon support. In fact, Pd + Ag-on-C becomes a much better catalyst for the semi- hydrogenation of the diene to monoene compared to the original Pd-on-C, as shown by the marked decrease in the amount of pentane detected in the products (1.5%). Pd-on-7-Al203, after Ag doping, also increased its already high selectivity and allowed the lowest quantity of pentane (0.5%) to be obtained along with the maximum yield of terminal monoene (45%). Hydrogenation of cyclooctadienes As was the case for Z-penta-l,3-diene, we have observed a strong cata- lyst deactivation for the systems doped to a ratio of Ag:Pd = 2, along with the inertness of systems containing only Ag. Therefore, activity and selectiv- ity comparisons have been restricted to Ag-containing derivatives having the ratio Pd:Ag= 1. The hydrogenation of the conjugated diene Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene was characterized by a high diene:monoene selectivity when using all the tested catalysts. The addition of silver to Pd-on-C and to Pd-on^-A^Oa produced a small decrease in the amount of cyclooctane with the first cata- lyst and a moderate increment with the second one. However, as shown in Table 2, the amount of cyclooctane was always less than 1%. The hydrogen- ation rate of the Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene, measured by the amount of the hydrogen uptake, proved to be almost independent of the diene concentra- TABLE 2 Molar percentage of products obtained from the hydrogenation of cyclooctadienes after addition of 1 mol Hi per mol diene3 Diene Catalyst Ag:Pd CgHis CgHu CgHu Vy^ JV 1,3- 1,4- 1,5- l,3-CsHi2 Pd-on-C 0 0.6 98.8 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.59 l,3-CgHi2 Pd+ Ag-on-C 1 0.5 99.0 - 0.4 0.1 0.53 l,3-C8Hi2 Pd-on-'y-Al^Ha O 0.4 99.2 - 0.4 - 0.83 l,3-CsHi2 Pd + Ag-on--y-Al2C>3 l 0.7 98.6 0.1 0.5 0.1 0.22 l,5-CgHi2 Pd-on-C 0 3.8 92.4 0.9 2.9 0.38 l,5-CsHi2 Pd+Ag-on-C 1 6.2 87.6 - 0.9 5.3 0.09 l,5-CgHi2 Pd-on-7-Al203 0 2.1 95.8 - 0.7 1.4 0.29 1,5-081112 Pd + Ag-on-7-Al203 l 5.3 89.4 - 2.3 3.0 0.08 r = 20 C, Pu = 1 atm, [diene] = 0.5 M in iso-octane, [Pd] = 1.3 X lO\"3 M.

Pd-on-C and Pd-on^-A^Oa show similar activ- ities (ca. 0.6 and ca. 0.8 mmol H 2 min\"1) which are lowered by silver; this effect is more relevant in the case of Pd + Ag-on^-Al^O^. With the non-conjugated diene Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,5-diene as a substrate we observed lower activities and poorer selectivities, and the addition of the first mole of hydrogen was less clearly indicated. Moreover, silver induced a strong negative effect on both Pd-on-C and Pd-on-T-Al^O^, as reflected by the decrease in activity, which was four times that of Pd + Ag-on-C and much higher for Pd + Ag-on^-Al^O^. In fact, with the latter catalyst, the reaction rate at 20 C was very low and thus we collected analytical data for a selectivity comparison from a reaction carried out at 80 C. The composi- tion of the cyclooctadiene fraction in the reactants showed that in the hydrogenation of Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene no isomers are detectable, where- as in the case of Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,5-diene only the 1,4-isomer is detectable. These observations, along with a comparison of the reaction rates, suggest a Tr-allyl mechanism for the hydrogenation of both 1,3- and 1,5-isomers in the presence of all the tested catalysts. In the case ofZ,Z'-cycloocta-l,5-diene, the rate-determining step seems to be the 1,5 - 1,3 isomerization process. Thus, the strong negative effect of silver on the hydrogenation rate of Z,2''-cycloocta-l,5-diene, which also causes a poor selectivity, should be ascribed principally to an inhibition of the palladium catalysts for the isomerization step. The data in Table 2 sug- gest also the use of silver-doped palladium catalysts for the selective semi- hydrogenation of conjugated dienes. Experimental Commercial Z-penta-l,3-diene and cyclooctadienes, supplied by Fluka, were distilled, filtered on activated alumina and stored under nitrogen atmo- sphere. All the solvents were reagent grade products distilled and stored under nitrogen atmosphere. Girdler 1% Pd-on^-Al^ catalyst was reduced at 350 \"C for 3 h under hydrogen flow (10 ml min\"1), washed with hot water and dried at 350 C under hydrogen atmosphere. Engelhard 5% Pd-on-C catalyst was heated at 350 C under hydrogen atmosphere. Both catalysts were stored under nitro- gen atmosphere. Pd + Ag-containing systems were prepared either from 1% Pd-on-7-Al203 catalyst (reduced at 350 C, washed and dried) or from 5% Pd-on-C catalyst, by stirring a suspension of the original sample into the required volume of aqueous 0.5% AgNOa and by evaporating the water at 110 C. Catalysts with Pd:Ag molar ratios of 1 and 2 were so prepared and used after reduc- tion under hydrogen flow at 350 C for 1 h. In a similar manner samples of 5% Ag-on-Ali03 (aluminium oxide, Riedel De Haen AG) and 5% Ag-on-C (active carbon. Carlo Erba) were prepared. The hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a thermostatted glass reactor connected with a gas burette and operating at atmospheric pressure. 215 The products of the hydrogenation reactions were identified and quan- titatively determined by GLC, with a Hewlett Packard 5880 A instrument, using a 1:2 AgNOa-phenylacetonitrile 15% on Chrom P, 6 m X 2 mm SS column connected to a 10% SP2401 on Chrom P, 3 m X 2 mm SS column, for products derived from Z-penta-l,3-diene, and a Carbowax 20 M, 50 m X 0.2 mm capillary column for products derived from cyclooctadienes. Analysis of starting dienes gave purities of 99.8% for Z-penta-l,3-diene and Z,Z'- cycloocta-l,5-diene and 97.1% for Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene (cycloocta-1,4- diene = 1.1%; cycloocta-l,5-diene = 0.4%; cyclooctene = 1.4%). The composition of the reaction mixture at the first equivalent point was determined by graphic interpolation of six experimental values collected between 0.8 and 1.1 moles of hydrogen added per mole of substrate. Conclusions The silver-modified palladium catalysts examined here cause apparently non-uniform variations of the original selectivities, owing to the importance of the support and of the diolefin substrate. However, the results can be rationalized as follows: (a) With conjugated dienes the catalytic systems possessing an already high diene :monoene selectivity are scarcely influenced by the addition of silver. This is true for Pd-on^-Al^O^ in the hydrogenation of Z-penta-1,3- diene and of Z,Z'-cyloocta-l,3-diene, and for Pd-on-C in the hydrogenation of Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene. (b) With the non-conjugated diolefin Z,Z'-cycloocta-l,5-diene, activity and selectivity changes are strongly correlated, and can be interpreted in terms of a decrease in the 1,5 - 1,3 isomerization rate caused by silver on both Pd-on-C and Pd-on-7-Al2C>3 catalysts. (c) The different behaviour of catalysts on carbon found in the hydro- genation of the linear and of the cyclic conjugated diolefins is principally due to the cis-trans rearrangement which is allowed for the open-chain pen- tadiene and forbidden for the cyclooctadiene. Thus, the strong isomerizing power of Pd-on-C produces the -penta-l,3-diene in considerable amounts during the hydrogenation ofZ-penta-l,3-diene. Owing to the lower reactivity of the -isomer with respect to the Z-isomer, also a lower -penta-l,3-diene: monoene selectivity should be taken in account. The addition of silver to Pd-on-C inhibits the Z-^-E pentadiene isomerization and induces better diene :monoene selectivity. Therefore a silver effect is not expected in the case ofZ,Z'-cycloocta-l,3-diene. Acknowledgements The authors thank Mr. N. Bonasia for experimental assistance.
