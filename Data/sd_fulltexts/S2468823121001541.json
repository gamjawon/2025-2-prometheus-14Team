Departamento de Química Orgánica Universidad de Córdoba Edificio Marie Curie (C 3) Campus de Rabanales Ctra Nnal IV-A Km 396 Cordoba E14014 Spain Graphical abstract Supported metal nanoparticles (Cu, W, Mo among others) have been stabilized on a silica matrix following an efficient and sustainable one-pot microwave-assisted protocol. The materials synthesized were characterized, mainly, by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDS). The materials exhibited large surface area and pore size in the mesopore range. The incorporation of metal particles in the silica matrix was also confirmed with particle size in a wide range between 2 and 52 nm. The catalytic activity of the resulting materials was evaluated in the catalytic wet oxidation of isoeugenol into vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The catalysts shown moderate conversions, up to 50–60 % for Cu-MINT with acceptable selectivity towards vanillin production (22–45 %), obtaining dimers as main side products. The stability of the catalysts was investigated as well, obtaining an imperceptible decrease after the fourth use. Keywords Wet oxidation Heterogeneous catalysis Microwave-assisted reactions Metal nanoparticles 1 Introduction Catalysis is considered to be a key component on the path towards sustainability [1]. While it has traditionally been in the best interest of companies to employ catalysts for process optimization from an economic standpoint, the push for greener processes has generated the demand for other aspects of catalytic optimization including waste elimination and avoiding the use of toxic or hazardous materials [1–3]. In addition to the need for improved catalyst design to take these aspects into consideration for existing processes, new developments in biomass valorisation and advanced processes still require significant progress with yields and reaction conditions before being practical at industrial scale [3–5]. In the field of catalysis, the use of heterogeneous catalysts has offered environmental improvements when compared to homogenous catalysts, along with easier handling and better separation [1,6,7]. Similarly, the employment of nanomaterials in catalyst development offers several advantages. The ability to directly work and control systems on the same scale as nature provides a unique approach for the production of chemicals, energy and materials [8]. In addition, the sizes, shapes and properties of the surface can be designed with greater precision to achieve more specific functions [9]. This field has been the focus of many researchers due to the importance of nanotechnology and the immense potential for handling of materials at an ultra-small nanometer scale (between 1−10 nm) [9]. These research efforts have resulted in a high number of applications for nanoparticles across many different areas including biomass valorisation [10–13]. Although nanoparticle catalysts have high catalytic activities due to their high surface-volume ratio, they suffer from some disadvantages such as reuse and performance on large-scale reactors [14]. For these reasons, nanoparticle stabilisation on supports is crucial for improved catalytic efficiencies [14]. The use of mesoporous materials including porous silicates has been extensively reported [15–17]. Mesoporous silica is one of the most researched and well-known mesoporous materials, ideal to control the structure, texture and shape of the final materials without causing any undesirable interactions [18]. Nanocatalysts can be prepared with these useful supports using a wide variety of conventional approaches such as impregnation/reduction, ionexchange and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [19]. Alternatively, there are novel procedures such as microwave-assisted deposition and mechanochemistry [20,21] rather promising for the preparation of supported metal nanoparticles. The use of microwave irradiation, in particular, has been shown to induce the formation nanostructures with the ability of controlling particle sizes and shapes [22,23]. Luque et al. developed a microwave-assisted procedure for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles supported in the structure of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) materials [24]. These materials are prepared by self-assembly from mixtures of n-dodecylamine, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), water and acetonitrile, giving rise to nanotubular structures, instead of the typical morphology of HMS materials [9,24]. The denoted Microwave Induced Nanotubes (MINT) could offer improvements to many different types of reactions, particularly in biomass valorisation and oxidation reactions to bring these sustainable technologies closer to industrial applications. A process of interest in biomass valorisation is the production of vanillin ((4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a compound widely used in many different industries including food, perfumes and pharmaceuticals [25]. The annual production of vanillin is roughly 20,000 metric tons per year, and it is expected to continue increasing due to the continuously growing demand [25]. At present, only 1% of total vanillin production comes from the extraction of natural material, as it is an expensive process, and the remaining 99 % from chemical and biochemical routes [26]. Biochemical routes utilize lignin, one of the main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass, as a starting material [26]. Eugenol, isoeugenol and ferulic acid derived from lignin are employed as substrates for the production of vanillin via simple oxidation routes [27,28]. However, low selectivity values have been a significant issue, as the purification and isolation steps are rather difficult due to the similar structures of the other phenolic by-products [29]. In this work, we report the microwave-assisted synthesis of metal (Cu, Nb, Mo, W) containing MINT like materials. The materials synthesized were characterized in order evaluated the protocol for different metals. The catalytic activity of as-synthesised materials was tested in the wet oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant under conventional heating. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials All chemicals used for the preparation of materials synthesised in this work were used as-received, without further purification. The silica precursor was tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, with 99 % purity. The surfactant employed was an amine, n-dodecylamine, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with a purity degree of 98 % and the solvent used was acetonitrile obtained from Panreac with a purity of 99.9 %. The metal salt precursors employed were: ammonium niobate oxalate hydrate, C4H4NNbO9.xH2O, (Sigma Aldrich, purity: 99 %), copper chloride (II) dihydrate, CuCl2.2H2O (Merck, purity: 99.5 %), ammonium metatungstate hydrate, (NH4)6H2W12O40.xH2O (Fluka, purity: 99 %), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, (NH4)2MoO4 (Sigma Aldrich, purity: 99,98 %), phosphomolybdic acid hydrate,H3Mo12O40P.xH₂O (Sigma Aldrich, purity: ≥99.99 %), phosphotungstic acid hydrate, H3PW12O40.xH2O (Sigma Aldrich, purity: 99,995 %). The reagents employed to assess the catalytic activity of the as-synthesised materials were isoeugenol, C10H12O2, (Sigma-Aldrich, purity: 98 %) and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant (Sigma-Aldrich, purity: 35 %). 2.2 Materials synthesis The nanostructures were synthesized according to the protocol reported by Gonzalez-Arellano et al. [30,31] for the preparation self-assembled nanotubular structures. According with such preparation method, in atypical synthesis, 0.6 mmol of n-dodecylamine as surfactant, 2 mmol of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 0.2 g of the metal salt precursor, 2 mL of water and 2 mL of acetonitrile were mixed together and microwaved for times ranging between 5 and 15 min at 200 W, reaching a maximum temperature between 80 and 100 °C, depending on the material. Subsequently, the materials were washed with acetonitrile, distilled water and acetone. Then, the surfactant was extracted with ethanol for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Eventually, the material was obtained after drying at 100 °C. The materials were named as M-MINT, where “M” stands for the metal incorporated and “MINT” is the acronym for Microwave Induced NanoTubes. For those materials prepared using heteropolyacid “HP” was added at the beginning of the name of the material. 2.3 Materials characterization Textural properties of as-synthesised materials were analysed using nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) though the use of a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 porosimeter (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Norcross, GA, USA). The samples, prior to the analysis, were evacuated at 130 °C for 24 h. The surface area (SBET) of the synthesized nanostructures was calculated using the linear part (0.05 < Po < 0.22) of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) equation. Pore size distribution as well as pore volume were estimated in the adsorption branch by the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) equation (Barret-Joyner-Halenda). X-ray diffractograms were acquired using a Bruker D8D Discover (40 kV, 40 mA) diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) using the Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54 Å). For the wide angle runs the scan speed employed was 0.05 s per step in the interval 10° < 2θ < 80°, while for the low angle measurements the interval was 0.5° < 2θ < 5° for the wide-angle acquisitions. The XRD instrument was coupled with a computer fitted with the “Diffract.Suite EVA” software version 3.1 (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) which allows particle size determination and metal phase identification. Elemental analysis of the synthesized materials was obtained using a JEOL JSM 7800 F scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokio, Japón) fitted with a X-max150 microanalysis system, window type detector SiLi, detection range: from boron to uranium, 127 eV resolution at 5.9 KeV. SEM images were obtained using a Phenom ProX SEM microscope with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. TEM micrographs were obtained employing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope JEOL JEM 1400 with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and a resolution of 0.38 nm between points. XPS measurements were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) multipurpose surface analysis system Specs™, equipped with the Phoibos 150-MCD energy detector (Berlin, Germany). Previously, the samples were outgassed under vacuum (<10−6 torr) for 12 h. ICP-MS measurements were carried out to determine the possible catalysts leaching in the reaction solution. The equipment used for the analysis were an ElanDRC-e spectrometer (PerkinElmer NexionX) equipped with a sample introduction, argon plasma ionization and quadrupole ion detection systems; in addition, the device is equipped with collision/reaction cells to eliminate some polyatomic interferences. 2.4 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the synthesized materials was investigated in the wet peroxide oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The reaction was carried out in a parallel reaction station Carrousel Reaction Station TM (Radleys Discovery Technologies). The reaction conditions were: 0.8 mL of isoeugenol, 1.2 mL of hydrogen peroxide, 8 mL of acetonitrile as solvent and 0.1 g of catalyst at 80 °C for 6 h. Moreover, the reaction was carried out adding the hydrogen peroxide by two steps (0 min and 30 min reaction-time) to study the possible improve of catalytic rate. The samples were analysed in a gas chromatograph Agilent Technologies 7890 A using a Petrocol™ DH (100 m×0,25 mm×0,50 μm) capillary column and a flame ionisation detector (FID). 3 Results and discussion The protocol followed for the preparation of the materials investigated in this work was developed by Gonzalez-Arellano et al. [30,31]. According to this protocol nanotubular structures could be obtained, influenced, mainly by the nature of the metal salt precursor. This protocol seems to be a promising alternative for the immobilization of heteropolyacids using a siliceous support. Low angle X-ray diffractograms (0,5°<2θ<5°) were recorded as depicted in Fig. 1 . CuMINT did not show any distinctive diffraction lines as consequence of not having any degree of ordering. In contrast, other materials such as HPMo-MINT did show a not well resolved single signal at 2θ values around 3° similar to that present in Hexagonal Mesoporous Silica materials (HMS) that may confirm the presence of this type of mesoporous arrangement in these materials [32]. The incorporation of metals on the materials was confirmed by XRD. As expected, the presence of reduced metal species was confirmed for most of the cases with the exception of the material W-MINT, where no distinctive diffraction lines could be identified due either to a low incorporation of the metal into the material or a good dispersion on the silica support (Fig. S1). XPS spectra in the Cu 2p region for Cu-MINT are displayed in Fig. S2. For both samples, fresh (a) and used (b) catalyst, the presence of Cu2+ was confirmed by the presence of two peaks at 934 eV and 954 eV corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. In addition, a satellite of Cu 2p3/2 in the region between 940 and 943 eV. Noticeably, satellite peak-shape is different for both fresh and used catalyst, while for the fresh Cu-MINT sample the shape of the satellite peak is typical of Cu(OH)2, for the used material due to the oxidant environment two satellite peak arise as consequence of the complete transformation of the hydroxide into CuO [33] Textural properties of the synthesized materials are summarised in Table 1 . The isotherm plots for all the synthesized materials, according to the IUPAC classification [34], correspond to type IV, as expected for mesoporous materials. According with the results shown in Table 1, the nanostructures prepared in this work exhibited high surface areas (SBET), ranging between 87 to 675 m2 g−1. The highest surface area was found for the material Cu-MINT, attributed to a higher microporosity observed in this material as compared to other samples. In addition, materials exhibiting lower surface areas presented a certain degree of macroporosity as observed in the isotherm plots (Fig. S3). Pore sizes (DBJH) of studied materials in this work were in all cases in the range of mesopores. Remarkably, all samples showed high pore volume (VBJH) values, corresponding, mostly, to the observed mesoporosity. The morphology of the materials could be clearly observed in SEM images, being similar to previous reported tubular shape morphology for related MINT materials [30] (Fig. 2 .a). Interestingly, TEM images for this material also revealed a good dispersion of tungsten oxide nanoparticles with an average particle size of 2 nm, much smaller than the particle size determined for other materials, measured using the Scherrer equation. The elemental analysis of selected samples is displayed on Table 2 was determined by EDS technique. These results confirm the effective incorporation of the different metals in the catalysts synthesised by microwave irradiation. Interestingly, the metals were incorporated in a surprisingly high loading, especially in the case of molybdenum, indistinctively of the salt precursor employed (either ammonium molybdate or in the form of heteropolyacid). In contrast, tungsten loading was small in the material HPW-MINT as compared to the metal loading found in the other analysed samples. These results were in good agreement with previous characterisation data (e.g. X-ray diffractograms without any distinctive line corresponding to the metal phase, Fig. S1) and TEM micrographs (Fig. 2.b) where tungsten oxide nanoparticles could be visualised. In addition, chlorine was detected in Cu-MINT as indicative of the incomplete decomposition of the salt precursor during the material preparation. With regards to particle size, it is important to mention that the particle size measured for the materials investigated in this work was unexpectedly high, above 20 nm, with already mentioned exception of HPW-MINT. MINT like materials loaded with different metals synthesised were employed as catalyst for the wet oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing agent under conventional heating (Scheme 1 ). The wet peroxide oxidative conditions investigated in this work may favour side reactions that lead to the formation of lignin-type oligomers. According to the catalytic activity results are displayed on Table 3 , all investigated materials exhibited significantly improved isoeugenol conversion as compared to blank runs (in the absence of catalyst). Nb-loaded materials were able to convert a higher amount of isoeugenol but in terms of selectivity towards vanillin it is not a significant catalyst as compared with other materials herein investigated. The catalyst with a better performance in terms of selectivity to vanillin was Cu-MINT (88 %) with an also important isoeugenol conversion of 58 mol %. As Fig. S4 shows, the isoeugenol oxidation rapidly achieves such conversion value remaining the unaltered. The remaining materials produced vanillin with a lower selectivity due the acid nature of these materials that lead to the production of side products such as diphenyl ether and calamenene. The differences in selectivity is especially interesting between the materials Mo-MINT and HPMo-MINT, while the material prepared using the heteropolyacid was able to produce vanillin the analogous material synthesized from ammonium molybdate that may lead to the formation of MoO3 species, known for being a good Brönsted catalysts and as consequence favour the undesired side reactions [35]. Alternatively, Cu-MINT materials were synthesized with changes in the last step of catalyst synthesis, the surfactant extraction with ethanol was carried out for 24 h instead of 6 h (Cu-MINT-6H vs Cu-MINT-24 H) to ensure complete template removal. This option has been preferred in order to avoid the formation of agglomerates or further chemical modifications in as-synthesized catalysts. Materials were tested during 6 h-reaction. At the same time, the experiments were also carried out modifying the hydrogen peroxide addition (a) 1.2 mL time 0 min and b) 0.6 mL time 0 min and 0.6 mL at 30 min) to study potential improvements in catalytic activity (Fig. S4). The catalytic results did not show significant differences as compared with the material extracted for 6 h and with complete hydrogen peroxide addition. The stability and reusability of the synthesised materials (Cu-MINT-6H and Cu-MINT-24H, Table 4 ) was investigated by the recycling test of the materials in the isoeugenol oxidation to vanillin. For such test, prior to their reutilisation, the catalysts were washed with acetonitrile and dried overnight at 100 °C. Results revealed that the materials herein synthesised showed a high stability, keeping their catalytic performance stable up to the 4th reuse. The reusability of Cu-MINT-24H was also compared during 3 reaction cycles (30 min reaction time, Table 4) with the material extracted for 6 h (Supporting information, Figs. S4–S6, Table 1) to show subtle differences between materials and a very minor deactivation (from 40 to 45 % to 30–32 %) was found for Cu-MINT-6H as compared to a stable and highly reusable Cu-MINT-24H after three reuses both in terms of activity and selectivity. These findings pointed to a better stability of Cu-MINT-24H that could be related to a more efficient removal of the template leading to better structured materials. The reaction filtrate was also analysed by means of ICP-MS. The average amount of leached Cu found in the analysed samples for Cu-MINT-6H after the fourth use supposes approximately a 11 % of the initial amount loaded in the fresh catalyst which may also explain the reduction in the catalytic activity found after the fourth use. Comparably, Cu-MINT-24H exhibited a stable performance that correlates well with the low Cu content in solution (ca. 4 % of the initial amount in the fresh catalyst) determined by ICP-MS. To the best of our knowledge, with the exception of niobium and copper loaded materials, this is the first report of molybdenum and tungsten materials for the wet oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin. Cu-MINT displays similar catalytic activity as other materials already reported in the literature such as copper oxide doped reduced graphene oxide, whose use allowed a maximum vanillin yield of 53 %, similar to the value obtained herein in this work by the Cu containing material. Nb-MINT exhibits lower performance in the production of vanillin as compared with other works carried out in our research group using SBA-15 aluminosilicates as support for niobium, which provided isoeugenol conversion of 69 % with a selectivity towards vanillin of 66 %.The results reported in this work, specially the data corresponding to Cu-MINT, can be considered an improvement as compared other catalysts investigated by our research group such Fe-based materials that despite of the higher isoeugenol conversion that is possible to obtain with this materials, the selectivity to vanillin was much lower [35–38]. 4 Conclusions The one-pot preparation of supported metal nanoparticles using a microwave assisted protocol has been carried out. Investigated nanomaterials exhibited a (nano)tubular shape as previously reported analogous material, with an inherent a mesopore nature with a certain degree of microporosity or macroporosity depending on the material. The synthesized catalysts possess a significant potential as catalyst in the wet oxidation of isoeugenol to vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant. The most remarkable result in terms of catalytic activity was obtained by the material Cu-MINT with an isoeugenol conversion of 69 % and a selectivity to vanillin of 66 %. The remaining investigated materials exhibited moderate performance in the production of vanillin to isoeugenol. The foreseeable acid properties in some of the investigated materials may allow the use of these catalysts in applications where acid sites or even bifunctional materials are required.

        "dc:description": "Supported metal nanoparticles (Cu, W, Mo among others) have been stabilized on a silica matrix following an efficient and sustainable one-pot microwave-assisted protocol. The materials synthesized were characterized, mainly, by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDS). The materials exhibited large surface area and pore size in the mesopore range. The incorporation of metal particles in the silica matrix was also confirmed with particle size in a wide range between 2 and 52 nm. The catalytic activity of the resulting materials was evaluated in the catalytic wet oxidation of isoeugenol into vanillin using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. The catalysts shown moderate conversions, up to 50–60 % for Cu-MINT with acceptable selectivity towards vanillin production (22–45 %), obtaining dimers as main side products. The stability of the catalysts was investigated as well, obtaining an imperceptible decrease after the fourth use.",
