Marta 2137, 30123 Venice (Italy) (Received March 30, 1988, accepted June 10, 1988) Introduction Recently cycloocta-l,4-diene (1,4-COD) was successfully used as a starting material in metathesis reactions using a WCle/EtOH/EtAlCl; catalyst [1]. In this study it was also pointed out that the low availability of 1,4-COD has limited its use in these reactions. Therefore a catalyst which is selective for the synthesis of 1,4-COD and will operate in continuous condi- tions would be desirable. We have previously reported that carbonyl clusters of rarer platinum metals effectively catalyze isomerization and reduction of cycloocta-l,5-diene (1,5-COD) in solution [2]. When a triosmium cluster is heterogenized on silica or other oxides, effective catalysts for isomeriza- tion of simple olefins are obtained [3a]. A comparative study on the isomerization of simple olefins catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogenized ruthenium catalysts has also appeared [4]. Here we report studies on the isomerization of 1,5-COD to 1,4- and 1,3- isomers catalyzed by silica-supported osmium and ruthenium carbonyls. The catalytic activity and selectivity towards formation of 1,4-isomer using both the homogeneous and the heterogenized catalysts are compared. Experimental Os3(CO)i2 and Ru3(CO)i2 were purchased from Strem Chemicals, solvents from C. Erba and cycloocta-l,5-diene from EGA Chemie. A fully hydrated highly porous silica (Grace, type 121, 30 - 50 mesh, B.E.T. surface area 700 m2) was used as support. The synthesis of the osmium catalyst (v(CO) = 2114(w), 2079(m), 2065(m), 2028(s), 1980(sh) cm-1) and the catalytic experiments in flow conditions were performed as described 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 30 elsewhere [5]. The physisorbed Ru3(CO)i2/silica catalyst (v(CO} = 2064(s), 2030(s), 2018(m, sh) cm\"1) [6] was prepared by refluxing a suspension of silica for 12 h under an inert atmosphere in an n-hexane solution of Ru3(CO)i2 [7], obtaining a metal loading of about 1% by weight. Air oxida- tion of this sample at room temperature for 5 days gave the oxidized ruthenium catalyst (Ru\"(CO)2/Si02) (v(CO) = 2061(s), 1999(s) cm-1) [8]. A typical batch experiment was carried out as follows: 0.25 ml of 1,5- COD (3.45 X 10~3 mol) were added to 25 ml of a stirred n-octane solution or suspension of the catalyst (1.75 X ICT5 mol of metal) at the appropriate reaction temperatures under inert atmosphere. In order to avoid leaching of the heterogenized catalyst, at the end of the batch experiments the solid was filtered off and 1,5-COD was added: the remaining solution showed no catalytic activity. Samples were periodically withdrawn from the solution and analyzed by GLC using a Perkin Elmer Sigma 3B instrument. Separation of the products was performed on a 30 m long Supelcowax 10 wide-bore capillary column. They were identified by comparison with authentic samples or by GLC-mass spectrometry. Results and discussion Isomerization of 1,5-COD to 1,4- and 1,3-isomers was investigated in the temperature range 40 -125 C by operating both in batch (Table 1) and flow conditions (Table 2). Results obtained in batch conditions using the homogeneous systems M3(CO) 12 (M = Ru, Os) or the heterogenized- on-silica ruthenium and osmium catalysts are reported in Table 1, runs 1,3, 4 and runs 2,5-10 respectively. The ability of carbonyl clusters of ruthenium and osmium to catalyze the isomerization of monoolefins in the homogeneous phase is well documented [9-11]. Consistently, both Ru3(CO)i2 and Os3(CO)i2 effectively catalyze the isomerization of 1,5-COD, even if to a different extent (Table 1, runs 1,3). As shown in Fig. 1, which represents a typical batch experiment, the formation of the 1,4- isomer is at first favoured with respect to the forma- tion of 1,3-COD, while at higher reaction times both the 1,5- and 1,4- isomers are consumed at comparable rates to form the 1,3- isomer as the final product. The overall reaction profile is consistent with a kinetically controlled two-step isomerization of 1,5-COD to 1,3-COD via formation of 1,4- isomer as intermediate product [12, 13]. Since the process occurs in the absence of dihydrogen in a solvent such n-octane, the most probable mechanism of cyclooctadiene isomerization has been proposed to proceed via a stepwise allylhydrido mechanism [10,12]. Ru 3( CO) i2 is known to coordinate cyclic olefins such as 1,5-COD and a complex mixture of tri- and tetranuclear ruthenium derivatives is obtained [14]. In our conditions, a similar reaction occurs which probably accounts for the sharp decrease in catalytic activity. During the reaction the turnover numbers drop from a value of 125 h~1 (calculated as reported in Table 1 note b, over the reaction time interval 5 -10 min) to a value of 52 h~1 31 TABLE 1 Isomerization of cycloocta-l,5-diene (1,5-COD) in batch conditionsa Run Catalyst Time %1,5-COD %1,4-COD %1,3-COD TN1' Sel.'

Moreover, at this point a mixture of non-identified ruthenium compounds is isolated from the reaction medium. When Ru3(CO)i2 is physisorbed on silica (see experimental) an isomerization catalyst is obtained which turns out to be more active than the homogeneous 'analogue' in the same reaction conditions (compare runs 3 and 5 in the Table 1). The ability of homogeneous and heterogenized 32 Fig. 1. Isomerization of 1,5-COD in a typical batch experiment (run 6, Table I): isomers us. time. 1,5-COD; 1,4-COD; A 1,3-COD. Ru 3(00) 12 to catalyze the isomerization of 1-hexene was reported [4] and the authors found the homogeneous catalyst more active than the hetero- genized one. In our reaction conditions, both deactivation of the homo- geneous catalyst (vide infra) and different surface species could account for the different behaviour. The ruthenium hydrido cluster H4Ru4(CO)i2 catalyzes the isomeriza- tion of 1-pentene with higher activities than those observed for Ru3(CO)i2. This result was attributed to the fact that, in the presence of the hydrido ligand, a catalytic cycle involving formation of o-alkyi intermediates is operative [15]. When Os3(CO)i2 and Ru3(CO)i2 are physisorbed on various oxides and heated, chemisorbed hydrido clusters [M3(CO)io(JU-H) (Ju-0-oxide)] (M = Ru, Os) are obtained [3b] which are known to catalyze the isomerization of olefins [3a, 16]. Formation of hydrido carbonyl species on the surface during the reaction cannot be excluded, and could account for the higher catalytic activity of the heterogenized system. Again, at higher conversions catalyst deactivation is observed. The turnover number of 500 h~1 (calculated at 20% conversion. Table 1 run 5) drops to a value of 385 h~1 (calculated at a conversion of ~50%). This decrease could be attribu- ted both to catalyst poisoning caused by the reaction products and/or to catalyst modification. Since both chemisorbed and physisorbed ruthenium clusters are thermally stable up to 85 C [6, 8], catalyst modification during the reaction must occur. This hypothesis was confirmed by results obtained using a recycled catalyst, which showed a significantly lower catalytic activity (turnover number of 45 calculated as reported in Table 1 note b). Moreover, the physisorbed ruthenium catalyst turned out to be active for longer reaction times at 70 C (Table 1, run 6), the turnover number reported in Table 1 being approximately constant up to conversion as high as 80%. 33 Selectivity in the 1,4- isomer increases by lowering the reaction tem- perature, and 35% yield in 1,4-COD can be achieved. The chemisorbed osmium cluster [Os3(CO)io(/x-H)(^-0 Si^)] is thermally stable up to roughly 150 C [3b] and no loss of activity is observed when it is used as catalyst (Table 1, run 2). The IR spectrum of the catalyst recovered from this run shows no change in the v(CO) region (v = 2126(vw), 2103(vw), 2077(m), 2064(m), 2024(s), 1980(m, sh)). The activity of the osmium catalyst is noticeably lower than that of ruthenium, as generally observed [10, 11]. Ru3(CO)i2 physisorbed on SiO; is unstable in the presence of oxygen [6, 8], and oxidation to the species Ru\"(CO)2/Si02 easily occurs on air exposure. We decided to investigate the activity of the resulting catalyst, since it can be easily handled in the air. The results obtained in the iso- merization of 1,5-COD with this type of catalyst are reported in Table 1, runs? -10. The catalytic activity of the oxidized species Ru^CC^/SiO^ catalyst is lower than that of Ru3(CO)i2/Si02. At a conversion of 20%, the turnover number reaches values of 120 h~1 and 500 h~1 respectively (Table 1, runs 7,5), while both selectivity and yield in 1,4-COD formation are comparable. The species Ru^CO^/SiO; was recycled twice and no large loss of catalytic activity was observed (Table 1, runs 8,9), while the selectivity in 1,4- isomer formation remained fairly constant. The IR spectrum of the catalyst recovered from the experiment reported in run 9, Table 1, shows the same pattern as the starting catalyst, with two strong absorption bands attribu- table to terminal carbonyls at 2059 and 1990 cm~1 with a shift of 10 cm\"1 for the latter with respect to the fresh catalyst. By lowering the reaction temperature, the yield in 1,4-COD increases, but a maximum value of about 35% is reached (Table 1, run 10). In order to obtain higher selectivities and yields in the 1,4- isomer, suitable reaction conditions were necessary. The catalytic activities of the heterogenized catalyts were therefore tested in a flow reactor where the influence of the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and contact time, on the selectivity could be more easily investigated. Consistent with the batch experiments, the osmium catalyst shows a lower catalytic activity and in order to obtain good conversions high contact times and high temperatures are required (Table 2, runs 1 - 5). A maximum yield of -20% with 40% selectivities in 1,4-COD can be achieved (Table 2, runs 4-5), but higher selectivities are obtained at much lower conversions (Table 2, run 2). In flow conditions the catalyst stability is lowered with respect to the batch experiments, and after 24 h reaction at 110 C, significant changes in the IR spectrum occur. The heterogenized ruthenium catalysts show catalytic activity higher than the osmium species. In fact, using the same feed composition and time factor, most of the 1,5-COD is already converted at 40 C with ruthenium catalysts (Table 2, runs 5, 6 and 10). The turnover numbers, for the species Ru3(CO)i2/Si02 and Ru\"(CO)2/Si02 in the experiments reported 34 TABLE 2 Isomerization ofcycloocta-l,5-diene (1,5-COD) in flow conditions' Run Catalyst Temp.

These values, obtained at 40 C, may be compared with those found for the same catalysts at 70 C in batch conditions (Table 1 runs 6, 10). The lower reactivity in batch con- ditions could be someway related to the diffusion of the reactants in the liquid phase. As already observed in batch conditions, higher yields of 1,4-COD can be achieved at lower reaction temperatures. Thus, using the Ru3(CO)i2/Si02 catalyst at 125 C at 78% of conversion, 21% 1,4-COD (selectivity 27%) is obtained, while at 70 C the yield of the 1,4-COD increases to a value of 33% (selectivity 42%) (Table 1, runs 4, 6). In flow conditions at 40 C, the selectivity in the 1,4- isomer at the same degree of conversion increases to 55% (Fig. 2), and can be further improved by lowering the time factor in the reactor (Fig. 2). Thus using a time factor of 4 X 10~3 gcataiyst min mF1, which corresponds to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 9600 h~1, a selectivity as high as 89% in 1,4-COD at 13.5% conversion is achieved (Table 2,run 8). The lower reaction temperature also improves the catalyst stability, and it should be pointed out that no appreciable loss of catalytic activity is observed for at least 50 h reaction in these conditions, with both Ru3(CO)i2/ Si02 and Ru\"(CO)2/Si02. The physisorbed Ru3(CO)i2/Si02 is known to decompose under mild conditions to metal [6, 8] which catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefins [4, 16]. When 25.5 kPa of hydrogen were added to the feed mixture, only traces of the hydrogenated product (cyclooctene) 35 W/F ( loo) Fig. 2.

Unfortunately, the high air sensitivity of this species [4, 8, 16], which is rapidly oxidized to Ru^CC^/SiO;, precluded its full characterization. The oxidized Ru^CC^/SiOi has also been tested in these conditions (Table 2, runs 9 -12), and no deactivation of the catalyst was observed. The IR spectrum of the used catalyst shows the same pattern as the starting carbonyl, with two strong absorption bands in the v(CO) region at 2059 and 1990 cm~1. The catalytic activity is somewhat lower compared to that of the Ru3(CO)i2/Si02 species, but as far as the selectivity is concerned there is no significant difference between the two catalysts in the range of conversion 20 - 60%, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, by adoption of a suitable time factor a yield as high as 47% of the 1,4-COD could be achieved (Table 2, run 9). These results, together with the advantages of using heterogenized catalysts, represent to the best of our knowledge one of the best methods for obtaining cycloocta-l,4-diene by catalytic isomerization of cycloocta-1,5- diene [12].
