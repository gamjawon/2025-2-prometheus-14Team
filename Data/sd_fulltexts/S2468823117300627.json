Graphical abstract Titanium-magnesium Ziegler-Natta catalysts are the basis of the modern processes for polypropylene production. These catalysts have been the object of numerous studies for many decades. Nevertheless, the structure of the catalysts remains a significant research focus. One of the major questions to be answered is the nature of the active sites precursor − the titanium compound, its form and structure on the surface of the catalysts. In the present study, the experimental data show that the precursor of the catalyst active site is TiCl4, which is weakly bound to the surface of the catalyst. This TiCl4 is able to migrate outside the catalyst particles and to adsorb on activated MgCl2, giving rise to new precursors of the active sites. The quantity of TiCl4, which is able to migrate easily, amounts to about half the total amount of titanium compounds in the catalysts. At the same time, the rest of titanium is tightly bound to the catalyst surface and does not produce the active sites. Keywords Ziegler-Natta catalysts Precursor Active sites MgCl2 surface Polypropylene 1 Introduction Application of activated magnesium chloride as a support for titanium tetrachloride and its derivatives became a seminal event in the field of Ziegler-Natta catalysis for the production of polyolefines. Heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta propylene polymerization catalysts consist of activated magnesium chloride, titanium tetrachloride, an electron-donating compound (the internal donor) and are used together with a cocatalyst (aluminum tryalkyl) and, as a rule, the external donor. The structure and mechanism of the formation of the active sites, as well as the role of the support, and the other catalysts components are still controversial because of the difficulties of direct study of the catalyst surface structure and a large variety of surface complexes. Activated MgCl2 contains small crystallites and a high proportion of lateral cuts with low-coordinated Mg ions; these lateral cuts can act as the support for TiCl4 and the donors [1–9]. It has been initially suggested that, during the preparation of the catalysts, TiC4 forms stable surface complexes with these exposed Mg ions. Indeed, as it was shown, the amount of TiCl4, which strongly binds to the support, is determined by the extent of the crystallinity (structure imperfection) of magnesium chloride [10]. At the same time, by reacting TiCl4, the increase of the coherent-scattering regions of MgCl2 was observed, apparently due to the elimination of defects on the surface or isomorphous substitution of Mg ions. A limited removal of titanium compound from the catalysts by washing with a hydrocarbon solvent or under vacuum also suggested the existence of strong bonds between TiCl4 and MgCl2 [1,10–14] due to the complexation of TiCl4 with coordinatively unsaturated magnesium ions on the surface [4,5]. Furthermore, there are published data on the difficulty of removing the titanium compounds from the catalysts at high temperature in vacuum or in the presence of the electron donor compounds [15,16]. In fact, the surface adsorption sites and TiCl4 surface complexes formed are nonuniform as to their strength and stability, respectively. This is indicated by a range ​​of the heat exotherm values upon the adsorption of various amounts of TiCl4 on highly dispersed magnesium chloride (values ​​from 20 to 60kJ/mol TiCl4) [13]. A similar value (ca. 40kJ/mol of Ti) of the binding energy was obtained in the experiments with the model TiCl4/MgCl2 system by temperature-programmed desorption [14]. The above binding energy values are quite low to ensure the irreversible adsorption of TiCl4, as would be expected based on the practically unremovable nature of TiCl4 from the real catalysts when exposed to solvent or vacuum. Indeed, for the model TiCl4/MgCl2 catalysts, prepared by ball milling of MgCl2 in the presence of TiCl4, it was shown that the catalysts contained weakly bound TiCl4, which can be removed by heptane washings [17]. A similar finding that the energy of the interaction of TiCl4 with the surface adsorption centers of magnesium chloride can be extremely low and does not provide for the irreversible adsorption of TiCl4 was supported by a number of theoretical studies [18–21]. Taking into account the low values ​​of the interaction energy of TiCl4 with the magnesium chloride surface (theoretical calculations), the discussions have even led to the actual denial of the TiCl4 ability to adsorb on the surface sites of MgCl2 and questioning the very existence of the titanium compounds in the oxidation state of +4 (TiCl4) on the catalyst surface [19]. The present paper reports some results of the experimental studies on the binding of TiCl4 with the surface of real titanium-magnesium catalysts. The experimental evidence clearly points to the weak and reversible binding of a considerable part of TiCl4 with the support surface in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The results also show that the precursor of the active sites of the catalysts is in the form of TiCl4, and this TiCl4 in particular binds weakly to the support surface. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials n-Heptane, n-butylchloride, chlorobenzene (PhCl), ethyl benzoate (EB), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), were used after dehydration over molecular sieves. Magnesium metal powder (about 85wt % of particles are in the size range of 0.1–0.18mm) was heated in a vacuum before use. All samples were prepared and handled under argon atmosphere. 2.2 Support The MgCl2 was prepared via reaction of the magnesium metal powder with C4H9Cl (molar ratio С4Н9Cl/Mg=3) in heptane at 98°C with subsequent washing with heptane. The MgCl2 contained ca. 3wt % of organic residue and had the surface area of ca. 100m2/g. Mg(OEt)2-based support was prepared via the reaction of PhMgCl solution (in Bu2O and PhCl) with Si(OEt)4. Mg(OEt)2 was prepared via the reaction of magnesium metal powder with EtOH. 2.3 Preparation of samples The catalysts with a composition of TiCl4/ID/MgCl2 (where ID means diisobutyl phthalate or ethyl benzoate, or 1-methyl-3-[methyl(phenylcarbonyl)amino]butyl benzoate, or a mixture of diisobutyl phthalate and ethyl benzoate) were prepared via the treatment of Mg(OEt)2-based support or Mg(OEt)2 with a mixture of TiCl4/PhCl (1:1 vol., Ti/Mg=10) in the presence of ID (ID/Mg=0.3) at 110°C for 1h and followed by two treatments with the same TiCl4/PhCl mixture at 110°C for 1h and 0.5h. Subsequently, the catalysts were washed once with PhCl and three times with heptane. The data on the composition of the catalysts are presented in the corresponding Tables. 2.4 Chemical analysis The titanium content in the samples was determined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The DiBP, EB and 1-methyl-3-[methyl(phenylcarbonyl)amino]butyl benzoate content was determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. 3 Results It was earlier found that the interaction of TiCl4/MgCl2 catalyst and AlEt3 cocatalyst resulted in the adsorption of AlEt2Cl and, possibly, AlEtCl2 on the surface of the catalyst [23]. The amount of the adsorbed aluminum species was close to the amount of titanium in the catalyst. It was also shown that a chemical exchange between the surface and dissolved aluminum compounds took place, and the time to reach equilibrium depended on the experimental conditions and exceeded several minutes. The equilibrium was shifted towards surface bound AlEt2Cl, and to provide a more pronounced displacement of AlEt2Cl from the catalyst surface, an excess of AlEt3 was required. However, most of these aluminum compounds were not removed from the catalyst surface neither under the influence of excess AlEt3 nor during polymerization [22]. It has been suggested that the presence of unremovable aluminum compounds on the catalyst surface may be a reason for a low number of active centers in the supported titanium-magnesium catalysts. On the basis of this assumption, an idea came up to try to reduce the concentration of chlorine-containing compounds of aluminum on the surface of the catalysts by introducing into the polymerization medium an additional “free” surface, which could be available for adsorption of these aluminum compounds produced by the interaction of the catalysts with AlEt3. Activated MgCl2 was chosen as the additional surface and a number of experiments was performed as follows. A glass ampoule with 0.5ml of suspension of the catalyst in heptane (concentration of 20mg/ml) was placed in a stainless steel polymerization reactor and the reactor was heated in vacuum at 80°C for 1.5hours. Then the reactor was filled with argon, the cap was opened and 1g of the MgCl2 was introduced into the reactor under argon flow. The cap was closed and the reactor was heated in vacuum at 80°C for 0.5hour. Then the temperature was decreased to room temperature and the reactor was filled with heptane, AlEt3, PrSi(OMe)3. The ampoule with the catalyst was broken and the reaction medium was stirred for 10minutes. The polymerization was started by the introduction of propylene. The polypropylene yield and the amount of polymer soluble in the solvent during the polymerization were determined. The results of the experiments are presented in Table 1 . At the introduction of the MgCl2 into polymerization medium (exp. 3) the yield of polypropylene (PP) increased by ca. 10% in comparison with experiments 1 and 2. Simultaneously, the amount of PP soluble in the solvent during the polymerization (APP) increased by a factor of two. The increase of the APP amount was seemingly the result of the decrease in the alkoxysilane concentration due to its adsorption on the MgCl2. Indeed, the amount of APP sharply decreased when the amount of alkoxysilane was doubled (exp. 4). At the same time, PP yield increased by additional 10% in comparison with experiment 3. The activity of catalyst 2 (exp. 5) was half that of catalyst 1 (exps. 1 and 2), but the effect of the introduction of the MgCl2 was similar to that in the case of catalyst 1: PP yield increased by 25% and APP amount increased slightly (exp. 6). In principle, the results obtained in experiments 3, 4, 6 could be interpreted as the migration of some species, which block the active sites of the catalysts, from the surface of the catalysts to the surface of MgCl2. To simplify the introduction of MgCl2 into the reactor, in one of the experiments MgCl2 (0.5g) was introduced in an ampoule containing a catalyst suspension (exp. 7), as MgCl2 was only impregnated by heptane. Thus prepared catalyst with MgCl2 was tested in the polymerization after a week similarly to experiments 4 and 6. As the result, a large irregular polymer powder was obtained, as Fig. 1 shows. The shape of the polymer particles replicated the shape of the MgCl2 particles (the shape of magnesium chips), which was introduced in the ampoule with the catalyst. The polymer particles of the regular spherical shape, which could correspond to the catalyst used, were practically not observed. Thus, part of the active site precursors redistributed from the catalyst surface to the surface of the MgCl2, producing a new catalyst. This redistribution of the precursors occurred during one week of keeping the ampoule with the catalyst at room temperature and 1.5hours at 80°C before the polymerization. At the same time, practically all the polymer was formed on the newly formed (in situ) catalyst and not on the initial catalyst. The polymer yield increased by 15-20% in comparison with experiment 4. The amount of APP increased greatly, since the newly formed catalyst did not initially contain the internal donor. A marked increase of polymer yield compared with that in experiments 1-4 points to the increase of the degree of utilization of titanium compound. A reason for that can be the increase of the dispersion of the titanium compound (precursor) upon its redistribution from the small amount of the initial catalyst to the larger amount of MgCl2. Thus, if we assume that all the titanium compound would pass from the initial catalyst to the MgCl2, then the titanium content in the newly formed catalyst could not be more than 0.052wt.%. Firstly, the experiment showed that the titanium compound which migrated from the initial catalyst to the MgCl2 was not the ballast compound, since the initial catalyst actually lost its activity upon the redistribution of the titanium compound between the initial catalyst and the MgCl2. Secondly, in the initial catalyst the titanium compound (the precursor of the active sites) was most likely in the form of TiCl4 and not in the form of other chlorides such as TiCl3 or TiCl2, since these chlorides are not soluble in heptane and, if present, could not migrate to MgCl2. Also, it is obvious that the migrating TiCl4 adsorbed on the surface sites of the MgCl2 as no TiCl3 or TiCl2 particles should be present as MgCl2 was prepared beforehand with no reducing agents present. Later, an experiment similar to experiment 7 was performed using a catalyst containing 7.6wt.% of 1-methyl-3-[methyl(phenylcarbonyl)amino]butyl benzoate as the internal donor (exp. 8). The catalyst had the average particles size of 18μm. It is known that when present the donor allows one to use titanium-magnesium catalysts in the propylene polymerization without external donors, and the use of the donor results in the increase of the molecular weight and MWD of polypropylene. The ratio of the MgCl2 and the catalyst inside the glass ampoule amounted to 30:1. The ampoule was heated for 4.5hours at 80°C before its introduction in the polymerization reactor. As the result of the polymerization, PP polymer consisted of large irregular particles (Fig. 1) and small regular spherical particles (Fig. 2 ). Large particles replicated the shape of the MgCl2, and small particles replicated the shape of the catalyst. The polymer yield was close to 10.5kg of PP per gram of the catalyst. As Fig. 2 shows, the polymer particles formed with the catalyst were about 200μm in size, i.e. 10-11 times larger than the size of the catalyst particles. It suggests that the real polymer yield of the catalyst was only about 1500g of polypropylene per gram of the catalyst. This was confirmed by a sieve analysis. The polymer was divided by sieves into two fractions − “large” irregular and “small” regular particles. The “small” fraction of the polymer amounted to about 20% of the total polymer. It means that only 20% of the polymer was formed with the catalyst and about 80% of the polymer was formed with the newly formed catalyst, which formed as a result of TiCl4 migration from the catalyst to MgCl2. Polymer particles were manually selected from both polymer fractions to analyze the MWD of PP formed by two different catalysts (the original catalyst and the newly formed catalyst). The MWD curves obtained are shown in Fig. 3 and are very different for the two polymer fractions. The MWD data (Table 2 ) shows that one polymer fraction consisted of a polymer with higher molecular weight and wider MWD than the other polymer fraction. Thus, one part of the polymer (“small” fraction) was formed with the catalyst and revealed increased molecular weight and widened MWD. The other part of the polymer (“large” fraction) was formed with the newly formed catalyst, and the polymer had molecular weight and MWD close to those of the phthalate/silane catalytic systems (phthalate as the internal donor and alkoxysilane as the external donor). The experiment showed that the main part of the “active TiCl4” (the precursor of active sites) migrated from the catalyst to MgCl2, since the newly formed catalyst produced four times more PP than the original catalyst did. At the same time, the remainder of “active TiCl4” gave rise to active sites producing polypropylene with high molecular weight and broadened MWD, i.e. the properties of the catalyst did not change upon the migration of the main part of “active TiCl4” and the catalyst only lost a significant part of its activity. Thus, one has to assume that the non-migrating TiCl4 molecules (“active TiCl4”) had alongside them the internal donor, and the migration of a part of the TiCl4 molecules did not produce free sites near the remaining TiCl4 molecules. Otherwise, one may expect the influence of the external donor (silane) on the polymer produced with the catalyst. To monitor the removal of TiCl4 from the titanium-magnesium catalyst the number of experiments were performed. The experiments were carried out in heptane in the presence of activated MgCl2. A similar technique previously allowed us to monitor the desorption of adsorbed compounds from MgCl2 [23]. The experiments were performed as follows. A 0.1g sample of the catalyst (catalyst № 1 from Table 1) was placed in a glass reactor under an argon atmosphere. A filter-paper bag was introduced in the reactor and 3g of activated MgCl2 was placed into the bag. Then the reactor was filled with 100ml of heptane (the amount was enough to cover the MgCl2 in the bag) and the reaction medium was kept for 6hours at 25 or 80°C without stirring. After that, heptane was removed and the catalyst sample was collected to determine its titanium content. The comparative experiments were performed without MgCl2. All experiments were performed in duplicate (Table 3 ). As shown by chemical analysis, the titanium content in the catalyst markedly decreased when kept in a large volume of heptane at room temperature (Table 3, exp. 2). The increase of the temperature to 80°C (exp. 3) practically did not influence the extent of the TiCl4 removal in comparison with the experiment at 25°C (exp. 3). At the same time, the removal of TiCl4 occurred without stirring of the catalyst, i.e. due to diffusion only. The absence of stirring was likely the reason for some deviation of the titanium content when the experiments were repeated. Surprisingly, the presence of the MgCl2 did not effect the TiCl4 removal at both temperatures (exps. 4 and 5). This means that the limit of TiCl4 removal from the catalyst was almost achieved without using MgCl2. The experiments showed that about half of the titanium compounds (in the form of TiCl4) in the catalyst was labile and taking part in the exchange between the solid and heptane. Based on the data in Table 3, it is reasonable to believe that the extent of TiCl4 migration from the catalyst to MgCl2 in experiments 7 and 8 of Table 1 was close to the extent of TiCl4 removal in the experiments of Table 3. In other words, one has to conclude that about half the titanium compounds in the catalysts did not further participate in the formation of active sites and acted as ballast. Another set of experiments on the removal of TiCl4 is presented in Table 4 . The catalysts used in these experiments were prepared from Mg(OEt)2. Ethyl benzoate and dibutyl phthalate or their mixture (1:1) was used as the internal donors. The catalysts were treated by a solution of diisoamyl ether in PhCl (25ml of PhCl per 1gram of catalyst at molar ratio diisoamyl ether/Ticat of 0.5) for 45min and followed by three washings with heptane. The treatment resulted in a considerable decrease of titanium content in the catalyst containing diisobutyl phthalate as the internal donor (samples 1 and 2). When sample 1 was subjected to the same procedure as sample 2, but without diisoamyl ether, no decrease of titanium content was observed (sample 3). The analysis of sample 2 by gas chromatography revealed about 3wt.% of the ether. The amount of the ether was close to the molar amount of the titanium compound removed from the catalyst. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that diisoamyl ether substituted titanium compounds on the catalyst surface. Therefore, diisoamyl ether bound more strongly to the surface of the catalyst than the titanium compound did. The removal of the titanium compounds also took place in the case of the catalysts containing ethyl benzoate or two esters (diisobutyl phthalate and ethyl benzoate) as the internal donor (exps. 4-9), i.e. the phenomenon did not depend on the type of the internal donor. The polymer yield of the catalysts greatly decreased after the treatment of the catalysts by diisoamyl ether (Table 4). As it was shown above, the precursor of active sites is “active TiCl4” and its removal resulted in the decrease of the activity of the catalysts. Consequently, the removal of titanium compounds in the presence of the ether has to be interpreted as the removal of “active TiCl4” too. At the same time, the yield of the catalysts decreased 1.5-2 times more than the titanium content did. This indicates, the catalysts contained similar amounts of “active TiCl4” and of the other titanium compounds (not a precursor of active sites). The same conclusion was made above on the basis of the data in Tables 1 and 3. Actually, it is possible to say that “active TiCl4” was preferably removed. Thus, the data of Table 4 expand the above conclusion: the catalysts contain similar amounts of “active TiCl4” and the ballast titanium compounds, with the latter binding more tightly with the surface of the catalysts than “active TiCl4”. Note also that some decrease of APP content was observed when the catalysts treated with the ether were used in the polymerization. 4 Conclusions As the study shows, the catalysts comprise both weakly and strongly bound titanium compounds. The weakly bound titanium compounds are TiCl4 molecules, which are able to migrate inside and outside catalysts particles. These TiCl4 molecules seem to form complexes with surface sites of MgCl2 and are in constant exchange with the solvent. These complexes are labile, and TiCl4 can be removed by big amounts of the solvent. The TiCl4 molecules, passing from original adsorption sites, adsorb onto other free adsorption sites of the surface. These weakly bound TiCl4 molecules are real precursors of the active sites. The strongly bound titanium compounds can not migrate over the surface of the catalysts and do not act as the precursors of the active sites. Moreover, these compounds do not seemingly play any role in the formation of the active sites by others titanium species. It means that these compounds are ballast, originating from harsh condition of the preparation of the heterogeneous Zigler-Natta catalysts. Possibly, these compounds can be occluded by MgCl2 at its formation, also isomorphic substitution or inclusion of TiCl4 molecules into MgCl2 lattice is possible. On the other hand, these compounds can also be TiCl4 surface complexes, but for some reason these complexes are stable and not labile enough to achieve fast equilibrium with the solvent in order to be removed by the solvent. The additional requirement for these complexes is their inactivity at further interaction with co-catalysts. As an example of the last, dimeric TiCl4 complexes at (100) face of MgCl2 at the interaction with co-catalyst (AlEt3) can produce dimeric TiCl3 complexes with no chlorine vacancy because of the formation of ‐((TiCl3)2-AlEtCl2)- chain where AlEtCl2 is an unremovable alumina compound with 6-fold surrounding of Al as that was mentioned in the beginning of the manuscript. It was also shown that the use of small amounts of ether to wash the catalysts allows one to decrease the content of titanium compounds in the catalysts. At the same time ether removes weakly bound TiCl4 from the catalyst, which is the real precursor of the active sites, and does not effect the strongly bound titanium compounds.

These catalysts have been the object of numerous studies for many decades. Nevertheless, the structure of the catalysts remains a significant research focus. One of the major questions to be answered is the nature of the active sites precursor − the titanium compound, its form and structure on the surface of the catalysts. In the present study, the experimental data show that the precursor of the catalyst active site is TiCl4, which is weakly bound to the surface of the catalyst. This TiCl4 is able to migrate outside the catalyst particles and to adsorb on activated MgCl2, giving rise to new precursors of the active sites. The quantity of TiCl4, which is able to migrate easily, amounts to about half the total amount of titanium compounds in the catalysts. At the same time, the rest of titanium is tightly bound to the catalyst surface and does not produce the active sites.",
