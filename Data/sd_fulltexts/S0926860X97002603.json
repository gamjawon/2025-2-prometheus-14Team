Solymosi*, A. Sze Institute Solid State and Radiochemistry, A. Jsef University, and Reaction Kinetics Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, P. O. Box 168. H-6701 Szeged, Hungary Received 24 January 1997; received in revised form 6 August 1997; accepted 6 August 1997 The reaction of ethane on unsupported and supported molybdenum compounds has been investigated at 773-973 K. ZSM-5 was used as support. Reaction products were analyzed using gas chromatography. Changes in the composition of catalyst samples were followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Unsupported M003 is partially reduced with ethane above 800 K to give HZO and CO2. The formation of H2, CH4 and CH4 was also observed. Mo-free ZSM-5 exhibited relatively high activity towards dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and aromatization of ethane above 773 K. Deposition of M003 on ZSM-5 significantly enhanced the conversion of ethane and also the selectivity of benzene production. Alteration of the catalytic behaviour of M003/ZSM-5 in time on-stream at 773-973 K was attributed to the reaction of M003, to carbon deposition and to the formation of Mo2C. Unsupported M02C catalyzed the dehydrogenation of ethane without producing benzene. In contrast, Mo2C/ZSM-5 was found to be an effective catalyst in the aromatization of ethane. At 973 K the conversion of ethane was N67% and the selectivity to benzene formation 31%. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V Keywords: Mo2C; ZSM-5; Ethane conversion; Benzene formation 1. Introduction After an extensive research on the oxidative coupling of methane [ 1,2], recently, increasing attention is being paid to the reaction of methane under nonoxidative conditions [3-9]. Whereas the dominant route is the decomposition of CH4 to carbon, on supported metals, with the formation of minor amounts of C, compounds [3-9], higher hydrocarbons and even aromatic compounds were also produced on oxide catalysts [ 10,11 ]. As regards the formation of benzene, M003/ZSM-5 proved to be the best catalyst *Corresponding author. 0926-860X198/$19.00 <G 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00260-3 [12-18]. The selectivity to benzene formation attained a value of 61-58% at 2.0-5.7% CH4 conversion. It is assumed that ethane and ethylene are the primary products, which - through several steps, some of them occurring on the support - are converted into benzene. Recent studies, however, revealed that M003 is transformed into M02C in the hightemperature introduction of CH4 with M003, and the M02C formed is considered to be the active site for the production of CH3 and CHZ fragments from methane [15-18]. In order to establish the mechanism of benzene formation, it appeared inevitable to know more about the reaction of ethane on M02C, which - to our knowledge - has not been investigated, yet. 226 2. Experimental F. Solymosi, A. Sze/Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 225-235 Catalytic reactions were carried out at 1 atm C2H6 pressure in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor consisting of a quartz tube (17 mm i.d.) connected to a capillary tube [14,18]. The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Generally, 0.5 g of loosely compressed catalyst sample was used. Reaction products were analyzed with the help of a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph and a Porapak QS column. The ethane conversion was calculated from the hydrogen balance. The selectivity values of product formation represent the fraction of ethane that has been converted into specific products taking into account the number of carbon atoms in the molecules. The XPS measurements were performed in a Kratos XSAM 800 instrument at a base pressure of 10-9 torr using MgKa primary radiation (15 kV, 5 mA). To compensate for possible charging effect, binding energies (BE) were normalized with respect to the position of the Si(2p) in Si02 (BE = 103.4) for supported samples and to Fermi-level for the Mo2C. The pass energy was set at 40 eV; and an energy step width of 50 meV and dwell time of 300 ms were used. Typically, 10 scans were accumulated for each spectrum. Fitting and deconvolution of the spectra were made using the VISION software (Kratos). Great care was taken to protect the samples from air during its transformation from the catalytic reactor to the XPS chamber. The gases used were of commercial purity (Linde). Ar (99.996) and HZ (99.999) were deoxygenated with an oxytrap. The other impurities were adsorbed by 5 A molecular sieve at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The H-ZSM-5 support was obtained by five times repeated ion exchange of Na-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 55.0) with an aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate (1 N), and calcined in air at 863 K for 5 h. M003/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by impregnating H-ZSM-5 with a basic solution of ammonium paramolybdate to yield a nominal 2 wt% of Mo03. The suspension was dried at 373 K and calcined at 873 K for 5 h. Before catalytic measurements each sample was oxidized in an OZ stream at 973 K for 30 min in situ and then flushed with Ar for 15 min. Hexagonal M02C was prepared by the method of Boudart et al. [19,20]. Briefly, about 0.5 g of Mo03 was heated in 1 : 4 methane-Hz mixture flowing at 300 ml (STP)/min in a quartz cell with two stopcocks. Preparation temperature was increased rapidly to 773 K and then at 30 K/h from 773 to 1023 K and maintained at 1023 K for 3 h. Following the suggestion of Boudart et al. [19,20], the sample was deactivated at 300 K with air or used in situ for catalytic studies. The BET surface area of this sample is 9.6 m2/g. Supported M02C catalysts were prepared by the carburation of calcined M003/ZSM-5 in the catalytic reactor, in a similar way as described above for the preparation of bulk Mo2C. 3. Results 3.1. Reactions of ethane on H-ZSM-5 First the catalytic behaviour of the ZSM-5 support was tested. It exhibited relatively high activity (2225% conversion) towards dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of ethane at 973 K. There was practically no decay in the conversion and in the rate of formation of various products. The highest selectivity, 38-40%, was measured for ethylene. This was followed by methane, S = 21-23%. Benzene was also produced; its selectivity varied in the 22-23% range. Lowering the temperature the conversion of ethane decreased and approached nearly zero valued around 773 K (Fig. 1). At the same time the selectivity to ethylene increased whereas that for benzene drastically decreased. No change was observed in the selectivity of methane formation (Fig. 1). 3.2. Interaction of ethane with unsupported 1003 In the first part of our work examined, the interaction of ethane and M003 under the experimental conditions applied for the conversion of methane into benzene. Reaction of ethane was observed above 800 K. The primary products were H20, C02 and CH4. In very small amounts, propane, butane and acetaldehyde were also detected. Above 950 K, H2, CO and CH4 were the main products. 3.3. Reaction of ethane with supported Mo03 Similar measurements have been performed with 2 wt% M003/ZSM-5 catalyst.

Sze/Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 225-235 5 exerted a dramatic influence on the product distribution. In flow experiments, a measurable reaction (2.54% C2H6 conversion) was observed even at 773 K (Fig. 2). At the beginning of the reaction, the reduction of M003 proceeded yielding C02, CO and H20. The latter two components were identified up to 100120 min. The main products of ethane reaction were H2, ethylene and methane. Propane, benzene, butane, and toluene also formed in smaller amounts. The rate of the formation of all these products increased in time on-stream (Fig. 2). The highest selectivity value (6768%) was obtained for ethylene. The selectivity of benzene production was relatively low, 4-5%. With the increase of the temperature the conversion increased, and at 973 K it attained an initial value of 95%, which decayed to ca. 50% at the steady state. The temporal dependence of the methane formation also changed at higher temperatures: in contrast to the other products its formation rate markedly decayed in time. Selectivity to benzene and methane increased, whereas that to ethylene, propane and toluene decreased with the rise of the temperature. In 100 S conv [%] 80 60 40 20 0 Fig. 3, we plotted the selectivities to various products measured at the beginning of the reaction and at the steady state as a function of reaction temperature. The effect of supports on the reaction of ethane was examined at 873 K. The conversion of ethane was considerably less for other supported sample, particularly for the magnesia-supported catalyst (> 1%). The M003/Si02 sample resembled most to the M003/ZSM-5 catalyst. On alumina-, magnesia- and titania-supported M003, the formation of ethylene occurred with highest selectivity. The selectivity to benzene was > 5% for M003/A1203. On M003/TiO2 and M003/MgO, benzene was identified only in traces. Some important data are presented in Fig. 4. 3.4. Examination of the used catalyst An examination of the M003/ZSM-5 catalyst after reaction revealed the deposition of carbon on the catalyst. Its amount increased with the increase of the reaction time. At the same time, the reactivity of carbon also changed.

After 10 min reaction of ethane at 773 K, we obtained two peaks - at 830 and 930 K. On increasing the reaction time, the low-temperature peak disappeared and the carbon was hydrogenated only in the broad hightemperature peak, Tp = 930 K. When the reaction of ethane was carried out at 973 K, the amount of carbon deposited greatly increased and reacted with hydrogen at higher temperatures, Tp = 1000 and N 1070 K. Note that the peak temperature of the hydrogenation of the pure M02C is -1000 K. Some characteristic data are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Formation of carbon in the reaction of ethane on 2 wt% Mo03/ZSM-5 229 The interaction of CZH6 with M003/ZSM-5 has been also followed by XPS. Spectra obtained as a function of reaction time at 773 K are plotted in Fig. SA. The binding energies (BE) for Mo(3d) were at 232.7 and 235.7 eV for oxidized MoO3. A slight change in the spectrum occurred even after a short (N10 min) CZH6 treatment at 773 K. After 60 min, a new peak appeared at 228.6 eV. An increase in the reaction time caused an attenuation of the peak at 236.0 eV and the intensification of the new peak at 228.6 eV. The C(ls) signal exhibited less changes.

When the reaction was performed at 973 K, the aforementioned changes occurred much faster (Fig. SB). For comparison, some XP spectra of different M02C samples are also shown in Fig. SB. 3.5. Reactions of ethane on M02C and M02CIZSM-5 supported In the next experimental series, the reaction of ethane was investigated on unsupported and ZSM-5 supported MoZC. On unsupported MoZC, the initial conversion was quite high (24%) which decreased to a low, constant value, 1.75% in 15 min (Fig. 6A). Besides HZ, ethylene (S = 90.0%), methane (S N 6.0%), propane (S = 2.0%) and butane (S N 1.0%) were found, but benzene was not identified. The product distribution suggests that the main process is the dehydrogenation of ethane. We also measured high initial conversion (28%) for the ethylene decomposition on Mo2C, which decayed to a constant value (N3%) in IS min (Fig. 5B). The main products are methane, ethane, propane and butane in commensurable amounts. Benzene and toluene were produced in trace amounts (S N 1-2%). A completely different picture was obtained for Mo2C/ZSM-5. Results are presented in Fig. 7. Similar to the case of M003/ZSM-5 catalyst, the reaction of ethane was observed even at 773 K. The initial conversion was 11% which decreased to 4%. In this case, neither Hz0 nor COz was found in the reaction products, and CO was detected only at the very beginning of the reaction. The other products were H2, methane, ethylene, propane and benzene. Traces of butane, pentane and toluene were also detected. Apart from the first values measured at 3 min, the rates of the formation of the products were practically constant. Selectivities of the main hydrocarbon products were SCHq = 12-16%, SC6H6 = 14-16% and SozH4 = 408%. When the calculation was based on F. Solymosi, A.

With the increase of temperature the conversion of ethane reached a constant value of 80%, the selectivity to methane significantly increased, whereas that of ethylene decreased. A moderate increase in the selectivity was measured for benzene formation: the highest value was 30% (Fig. 8). The effects of contact time on the reaction of ethane was determined by variation of the space velocity. Results are plotted in Fig. 9. We obtained the result that, with the increase of the contact time, the conversion and the selectivity to methane increased while the selectivity to ethylene decreased. No change occurred in the selectivity to benzene. Some important data for the transformation of ethane on different catalysts are shown in Table 2. 232 F. Solymosi, A.

Reactions of ethane on ZSM-5 and Mo03 The aromatization of ethane over promoted ZSM-5 has been the subject of extensive research [2,21-28]. The effects of several additives (Ga, Zn, Pt, etc.) have been examined and active and selective catalysts prepared [21-28]. At high temperature, above 823 K, the aromatization of ethane proceeds on undoped ZSM-5 itself: the preparation, the composition of the ZSM-5 and the experimental conditions all influence the conversion and product distribution [21-28]. The reaction of ethane was measurable at 873 K on our ZSM-5 sample (Fig. 1). The dehydrogenation reaction was the dominant pathway. The formation of benzene was limited, the selectivity was only 3-5 %. At 973 K, this value increased to N22%. These characteristics are consistent with the results of Schultz and Baerns [25] and differ from the behaviour reported recently by Wong et al. [28]. They found aromatics (with 51.8% selectivity) and methane (with 48.2% selectivity) at ethane conversion of 5.9% at 923 K. No data for ethylene formation was given. The reaction of ethane with unsupported Mo03 was detected above 850 K when H20, C02, C2H4, Co and H2 and CH4 were produced. The conversion of ethane at 973 K approached the value of 10%. 4.2. Reactions of ethane on M0031ZSM-5 The situation was different when Mo03 was deposited on ZSM-5 and calcined at 973 K. This treatment resulted in high dispersion of Mo03 and very likely in an interaction between Mo03 and ZSM-5. As a result, the reduction of Mo03 started at a higher temperature. The conversion of ethane significantly increased and the product distribution also differed (Fig. 3). Both the yield and the selectivity of benzene formation markedly increased (Table 2). Note that even the mechanical mixture of Mo03 with ZSM-5 exhibited an improved performance as regards the conversion of ethane and the formation of benzene. Whereas at F. Solymosi, A.

A partial reduction of M003 is clearly indicated by is the main reaction, above 873 K the formation of the initial formation of H20 and CO. The deposition of CH4 and C61-16 carbon was also observed which increased with the time on-stream. XPS data also suggest the reduction of C2H6 - CH4 + Hz + C (2) M003 which, however, proceeds much slower than or with CH4. The signal around 235.5-236.0 eV, indica live of the presence of Mob+, is still strong even after a C2H6 + Hz = 2CH4 (3) reaction of 2 h at 773 K. The characteristic binding 3CZH6 = C6H6 + 6H2 (4) energies of Mo(3d) in the M02C are at -231.1 and 227.8-228.3 eV [16,29-31]. Deconvolution of the come into prominence. In addition to reaction 2, the spectra suggest that - in the contrast to the decomposition of ethylene CH4 + M003/ZSM5 system - the complete transfor CZH4 = CH4 + C (5) mation of M003 into M02C does not occur even at 973 K, but M02C is produced in an increased amount with also contributes to the deposition of surface carbon. the increase of temperature and reaction time with Changes in the conversion and in the rates of C2H6. Note that exact stoichiometry of carbide formed product formation occurring in time on-stream suggest is not certain as the molybdenum carbide species an alteration of M003 during the reaction. This may having a different stoichiometry gives nearly the same consist of (i) reduction of M003, (ii) deposition of XPS spectrum. 234 F. Solymosi, A.

Effects of the contact time on the conversion of ethane and on the selectivities of the formation of various products on MoZC/ZSM-5 at 973 K. 4.3. Reaction of ethane on M02C and M02CIZSM-5 Unsupported M02C catalysed the dehydrogenation of ethane at 973 K without production of benzene (Fig. 6A). Ethylene also reacted on Mo2C, at this temperature, to give several hydrocarbons, but benzene formation was not observed (Fig. 6B). A significant improvement in the catalytic performance of M02C occurred when it was produced on ZSM-5. Apart from the very initial values, no changes in the conversion and selectivities to various products were experienced in time on-stream. Qualitatively, we observed the formation of the same C-containing compounds as in the case of Mo03/ZSM-5, which suggests the occurrence of similar reaction as was suggested for Mo03/ZSM-5. An important difference is that the products of the reduction of Mo03 (H20, COZ, CO) were missing. The advantageous properties of this catalyst were particularly revealed above 873 K, when the steady-state conversion reached a value of 65% with a 30% selectivity to benzene (Fig. 8). These results suggest that the highly dispersed Mo2C/ZSM- 5 is a better catalyst for the transformation of ethane than the Mo03/ZSM-5 and the enhanced production of benzene in time on-stream is possibly due to the formation of Mo2C. Another difference is that, on MozC/ZSM-5, less ethylene and more methane are formed at the same ethane conversion. Accordingly, the aromatization of ethylene on Mo2C/ZSM-5 is more favored compared to Mo03/ZSM-5. It is important to emphasize that the role of the Mo compounds is mainly the activation of ethane and the promotion of the formation of ethylene. The further reactions, namely the oligomerization and the aromatization of ethylene proceed on the acidic sites on ZSM-5. In accord with the literature data, we found that the latter reaction is rapid on the ZSM-5 used in the present study. The conversion of ethylene was > 90% and the selectivity of benzene formation attained a value of 30% even at 773 K. In the light of these results, it is interesting that a relatively large amount of ethylene is released from the ZSM-S-based catalysts or, in other words, a large fraction of ethylene produced escapes aromatization. This suggests that the M02C and/or the carbon formed in the reaction of ethane poisons the acidic sites of ZSM-5 and prevents the aromatization of ethylene. As the aromatization of methane was investigated on the same Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst, we may compare the results obtained in the two reactions. The remarkable difference is that the conversion of ethane is markedly higher than that of methane. As a result, the rates of the formation of all products were higher. Comparing the selectivities at nearly the same conversion, ca. 6-10%, (which was measured at 773 K for the reaction of ethane, and at 973 K for the reaction of methane), we obtain that the selectivity of benzene formation is much less (15%) for ethane reaction than in the case of methane aromatization (N85%). We attribute this to the more extended formation of excess carbon, which may block some of the acidic sites of ZSM-5. 5. Conclusions 1. In the high temperature interaction of CZH6 with Mo03/ZSM-5, we observed the reduction of Mo03, the deposition of carbon and the formation of Mo2C. F. Solymosi, A. Sze/Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 225-235 235 2. The aromatization of ethane on H-ZSM-5 occurred above 773 K. 3. Deposition of M003 on ZSM-5 improved the catalytic performance of ZSM-5: the conversion of ethane and the selectivity of benzene formation increased, which was attributed to the formation of Mo2C. 4. This idea is supported by the high activity of Mo2C/ZSM-5 in the production of ethylene which is aromatized on the acidic sites of ZSM-5.

The reaction of ethane on unsupported and supported molybdenum compounds has been investigated at 773–973 K. ZSM-5 was used as support. Reaction products were analyzed using gas chromatography. Changes in the composition of catalyst samples were followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Unsupported MoO3 is partially reduced with ethane above 800 K to give H2O and CO2. The formation of H2, C2H4 and CH4 was also observed. Mo-free ZSM-5 exhibited relatively high activity towards dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and aromatization of ethane above 773 K. Deposition of MoO3 on ZSM-5 significantly enhanced the conversion of ethane and also the selectivity of benzene production. Alteration of the catalytic behaviour of MoO3/ZSM-5 in time on-stream at 773–973 K was attributed to the reaction of MoO3, to carbon deposition and to the formation of Mo2C. Unsupported Mo2C catalyzed the dehydrogenation of ethane without producing benzene. In contrast, Mo2C/ZSM-5 was found to be an effective catalyst in the aromatization of ethane. At 973 K the conversion of ethane was ∼67% and the selectivity to benzene formation 31%. Keywords Mo2C ZSM-5 Ethane conversion Benzene formation References [1] Bibby D.M. Chang C.C. Howe R.F.
