The effect of the precursor and conditions employed to prepare MgO on the conversions of CO2 and CH4, and the CO yield over the reduced NiO/MgO catalyst in the CO2 reforming of CH4 was investigated. The yield and the conversions increase with reaction time and attain constant values. The latter values as well as the induction time depend upon the precursor and conditions employed to prepare MgO. Keywords: MgO; NiO; CO2; Synthesis gas; Reforming 1. Introduction One of the most important applications of methane is its use in the preparation of synthesis gas. Three processes can produce synthesis gas from methane, namely: steam reforming (1), CO2 reforming (2) and partial oxidation (3): CH4 + H20 ---+ CO h- 3H2, AH = 225.4kJ/mol, (1) CH4 q- CO2 ~ 2CO + 2H2, AH = 247 kJ/mol, (2) CH4 + 1/202 ~ CO + 2H2, AH = -38kJ/mol.

However, this process has poor selectivity for CO and provides a too high H2/CO ratio, unsuitable for methanol and Fischer-Tropsch syntheses [ 1,2]. Compared to steam reforming, the partial oxidation provides very high activity and selectivity, and a suitable CO/H2 ratio [3-12]. However, although this reaction is only mildly exothermic, a small decrease in the CO selectivity due to the complete combustion of methane, which is a highly exothermic reaction, results in a large increase in the reaction temperature. In addition, a high methane conversion coupled with a high space velocity can produce a large amount of heat in a small region of the catalyst (hot spot). Because it is difficult to remove this heat from the reactor, particularly from a large-scale equipment, the process becomes difficult to control [12]. In recent years, renewed interest in methane conversion to synthesis gas via the CO2 reforming reaction has arisen [13-19]. While this pathway provides a high CO selectivity and a more suitable Ha/CO ratio, it could not be used industrially because of the ageing of the catalyst, caused mainly by carbon deposition [20]. In the CO2 reforming of CH4, the carbon deposition sequence for various metals, reported by Rostrup-Nielsen [21] is: Ni >> Pt > Ru. Ashcroft et al. [13] and Rostrup-Nielsen [21] observed that carbon deposition cannot be avoided over nickel supported catalysts and for a CO2/CH4 molar ratio of 1 : 1. Tang et al. [22] investigated the effect of the support on carbon deposition. Ashcroft et al. [13] suppressed the carbon deposition in CO2 reforming by replacing Ni with platinum- group catalysts; this provided a CO yield of 69% for Ru and 89% for Ir for a stoichiometric feed of COa and CH4. It is, however, worthwhile to develop improved stable and effective nickel-based catalysts, because of the high cost of the noble metals. While Rostrup-Nielsen [23] noted that carbon-free steam reforming of methane can be achieved using a partly sulfur-passivated nickel catalyst, sulfur also reduces the activity of the catalyst. Zhang et al. found that Ni/ La203 has high CO yield and stability [24]. We demonstrated, however, that the stability of Ni/La203 catalysts, in the CO2 reforming of methane, is dependent on the preparation conditions of the catalyst and that a small amount of chlorine in Ni/ La203 enhances the stability of the catalyst [25]. In addition, we found that the reduced NiO/MgO catalysts prepared using the Aldrich MgO have a high CO yield (94%) and excellent stability and that MgO, with which NiO forms a solid solution, inhibits carbon deposition [26,27]. Because of their very similar structures, NiO and MgO are miscible over the entire molar fraction range and form an ideal solid solution [28]. The physico- chemical properties of this solid solution were widely investigated [29-33]. Bond and Sarsam's research revealed the role of Ni precursor and preparation conditions on the reducibility of magnesia-supported NiO and on the diffusion of Ni2+ ions into the MgO lattice [34]. Borowiecki [35] and Parmaliana et al. [33] reported the effects of calcination temperature and treatment atmosphere on the phase compo- sition of NiO-MgO solid solutions. The interactions between small gas molecules, such as CO, CO2 and CH4, and the solid solution were also studied [30-32]. Our E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 185-205 187 recent investigations revealed the effect of the composition of the solid solution on CO adsorption [36] and on CH4 activation [37]. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the precursor and the conditions used to prepare MgO affect in significant ways the catalytic activity and selectivity of the NiO/MgO catalysts in the CO2 reforming of methane. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation 2.1.1. MgO preparation MgO supports were prepared by decomposing Mg(NO3)2, (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2 or Mg(OH)2 (Aldrich, Milawaukee,WI) in air under various conditions listed in Table 1. 2.1.2. The preparation of NiO/MgO catalyst The catalyst was prepared by impregnating a MgO powder with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Alfa, Danvers, MA), followed by drying at room temperature in air and finally by calcination at 800 in air for 1.5 h. The catalyst contained 13.1 wt.% Ni. 2.2. Catalytic reaction The catalytic reaction was carded out under atmospheric pressure, at 790, in a flow system, using a vertical quartz tube (2 mm id) reactor. The catalyst powder (weight: 0.02 g) was held on quartz wool. The molar ratio of the reactant gases (99.99% purity), with a GHSV---60000 cm3 g-1 h-l, was CO2/CH4=1 \" 1. The catalyst was reduced in a flow of H2 (99.99% purity; 20 ml/min) at 500 for 14 h, followed by an increase in temperature to 790 at a rate of 20/min, also in a flow of H2 (20ml/min). The analysis of the reactant/product mixtures was performed with an in-situ gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q Table 1 Preparation conditions of MgO MgO Preparation conditions Mg-1 Mg-2 Mg-3 Mg-4 Mg-5 Mg-6 Mg-7 Decomposition of Mg(NO3)2 at 400 for 3 h.

The yield to CO was calculated using the expression: [CO/(CO + CO2 + CH4)] 100%. 2.3. BET surface area and pore size distribution measurements The surface area and the pore size distribution were determined via nitrogen adsorption, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. The surface area was calculated using the BET method, while the pore size distribution curve was obtained from the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm by the BJH method [38]. The sample was degassed at 200 in high vacuum before measurements. 2.4. X-ray powder diffraction X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Nicolet X-ray diffrac- tion instrument, equipped with a Cu Ka source, at 40 kV and 20 mA. The lattice parameters of MgO and NiO/MgO were calculated from the diffractions of (220), (311) and (222) faces using the expression a = (h2 + k2 + 12)U2A/(2sinO), and the crystallite size (d) estimated using Scherrer equation: d = KA/(/3cosO), where/3=B-b, and K, 0, B, b and A are, respectively, a constant, the diffraction angle, the total breadth at half-maximum intensity of the diffraction line, the breadth at half-maximum intensity due to the instrumental broadening and the wave length. The constant, K, has the value 9.0. 3. Results 3.1. XRD of MgO and NiO/MgO From the XRD patterns (Fig. 1), one can conclude that MgO, prepared via the decomposition of various precursors, has a cubic crystalline structure (patterns d do not completely correspond to the cubic lattice of MgO, because the precursor [MgCO314Mg(OH)2 was not completely decomposed). The lattice parameters of MgO calculated from the diffractions of (220), (311) and (222) faces are listed in Table 2, which shows that the MgO supports prepared from various precursors have lattice parameters between 4.1893 and 4.2099 A. The crystal sizes estimated from the diffraction line broadening are also listed in Table 2, which shows that the crystal sizes vary between 3.2 and 11.7 nm. E, Ruckenstein, Y.H.

BET surface area and pore size distribution The BET surface areas of MgO and NiO-MgO are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Table 2 shows that Mg-1, Mg-4 and Mg-5 have very small surface areas (3, 1 and 6 mZ/g, respectively), Mg-6 and Mg-7 medium surface areas (24 and 26 mZ/g, respectively) and Mg-2 and Mg-3 large surface areas (146 and 235 mZ/g, respectively). Table 3 shows that the NiO/MgO catalysts, prepared from Mg-x (Table 1) and denoted Ni-Mg-x, have relatively small surface areas, in the range 5- 24 m2/g. Fig. 3 indicates that Mg-1, prepared from Mg nitrate, has very few pores, mainly in the range 40-350 ,~. After Mg-1 was used to prepare Ni-M~-I, the number of pores in the range 40--350 ,~ decreased, while those below 40 A increased. Fig. 4 shows that Mg-2 has a large number of pores, mainly in the range 20-100 .~; most of the pores collapsed after Mg-2 was used to prepare Ni-Mg-2. Fig. 5 shows that Mg-3 has numerous pores, mainly in the range 20-50 A, and that most of the pores collapsed after Mg-3 was used to prepare Ni-Mg-3. Fig. 6 shows that Mg-4 has very few pores, mainly below 100 A, and that their number increases, remaining however in the same range of pore diameters, after Mg-4 was used to prepare Ni- Mg-4. Fig. 7 shows that Mg-5 has numerous pores, mainly below 100 A; after it o was used to prepare Ni-Mg-5, additional pores, in the range 100-1000 A, were generated. Fig. 8 indicates that Mg-6 has numerous pores, mainly below 100 A, which decreased in number after it was used to prepare Ni-Mg-6. Fig. 9 shows that Mg-7 has numerous pores, distributed mainly in two ranges: below 100 ,~ and between 100 and 1000 ,~,, which remain almost unchanged after it was used to prepare Ni-Mg-7. 3.3.

There are small differences in the peak positions of NiO and MgO, of 0.6, 0.8 and 0.81for 20_-__62.64, 75.00 and 79.00, corresponding to the (220),(311) and (222) faces (Fig. 1). Therefore, the above three diffraction lines can be used to identify the formation of a solid solution. If a NiO-MgO solid solution had not been formed, three double peaks at 20 of about 62.64, 75.00 and 79.00 would have appeared. Fig. 2 shows, however, that for all NiO/MgO catalysts, there are only three single peaks near the preceding 20 values. This demonstrates that a solid solution was, indeed, formed. After reaction, the lattice parameters are somewhat larger, because a fraction of NiO was reduced to Ni. The XRD patterns after reaction, presented in Fig. 2b, do contain the peaks of Ni. The results regarding the CO2 reforming of CH4 reveal that the depen- dence of the conversions and CO yield on reaction time is affected by both the precursor and conditions employed to prepare MgO. This happens most probably because the catalytic activity and selectivity of the NiO/MgO solid solution catalysts are closely related to the reducibility of NiO. A number of investigations revealed that the reducibility of NiO is dependent on the composition of NiO/MgO solid solution, the structure of MgO, as well as on the calcination temperature and duration used in the preparation of the solid solution [33-35]. Therefore, the generation of Ni sites suitable for the catalytic process should be affected by the precursor and conditions employed in the preparation of MgO. The MgO used to prepare the Ni-Mg- 1 catalyst has a very small surface area and very few pores (Fig. 3 and Table 2). For this reason, during the preparation of the catalyst, the surface layer becomes rich in NiO which is easily reduced to Ni As a result, high initial conversions and a high initial CO yield are obtained (Fig. 10). In contrast, the MgO used to prepare Ni-Mg-2 has a very large surface area and numerous pores (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Because of the large contact area, the surface layer does not become as rich in NiO as in the previous case. In addition, the large number of pores favors the sintering of MgO, and thus a large fraction of NiO becomes unavailable to the catalytic process. For these reasons, the initial conversions and initial CO yield are low (Fig. 10). Ni-Mg-3 behaves like Ni- Mg-2. In the Ni-Mg-3 case, the Mg carbonate did not decompose completely at 400 during the preparation of MgO; it decomposed completely only during the calcination of the NiO/MgO catalyst. Indeed, the X-ray patterns (Fig. ld) indicate that MgCO3 is still present, while Fig. 2c shows that after calcination at 800, the NiO/MgO catalyst is free of MgCO3. The simultaneous decomposition of MgCO3 and Ni(NO3)2 during the calcination at 800 favors the formation of a solid solution between NiO and MgO. The increase of the CO yield with reaction time occurs because the NiO which was not reduced in H2 continues to be reduced by the feed gas. The reduction of NiO during reaction might be due to the strong E. Ruckenstein, Y.H. Hu/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 185-205 203 interactions between CO2 and MgO; these interactions decrease those between Nit and MgO in the NiO/MgO solid solution and stimulate the reduction of Nit by CH4 and/or by the CO and H2 produced. When Mg-2 and Mg-3, obtained via the decomposition at 400, were addi- tionally calcined at 1000 for 3 h to get Mg-4 and Mg-5, most pores collapsed (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7), resulting in large decreases in surface areas (Table 2). Consequently, the amounts of Nit present in the surface layer are greater in Ni-Mg-4 and Ni-Mg-5 than in Ni-Mg-2 and Ni-Mg-3, respectively. In addition, Mg-4 and Mg-5 have smaller lattice parameters than Mg- 1 and Mg-2, respectively, i.e., the binding between Mg and O is stronger in Mg-4 and Mg-5 than in Mg-1 and Mg-2. For this reason, Nit diffuses with higher difficulty into the bulk of MgO in Mg-4 and Mg-5 than in Mg-1 and Mg-2. A greater amount of Nit will be therefore present in the surface layers of Ni-Mg-4 and Ni-Mg-5 than of Ni-Mg-1 and Ni- Mg-2. Since the Nit in Ni-Mg-4 and Ni-Mg-5 can be more easily reduced than in Ni-Mg-2 and Ni--Mg-3, the initial CO yields and the initial conversions are higher in the former cases. Mg-6 and Mg-7 have been prepared from [MgCO3]4Mg(OH)2 in different conditions: Mg-6 via calcination at 800 for 3 h and Mg-7 via calcination at 1100 for 10 min. They have, however, the same surface areas. When Mg-6 was employed to prepare Ni-Mg-6, some of its pores collapsed during calcination at 800 (Fig. 8) and its surface area decreased because of sintering (Table 3). For this reason, most of the Nit became unavailable to the catalytic process and only a small amount remained on the surface layer of Ni-Mg-6. This explains the low initial activity of this catalyst. In contrast, when Mg-7 was employed to prepare the Ni-Mg-7 catalyst, the distribution of its pores and its surface area have hardly changed after the calcination of the catalyst at 800. Because Mg-7 was prepared via the decomposition of [MgCO3]gMg(OH)2 at 1100 for only l0 rain, defects in the MgO structure are likely to have formed. These defects promote the diffusion of Nit into MgO, resulting in a small amount of Nit in the surface layer. For this reason, Ni-Mg-7 has low initial conversions of CH4 and CO2 and a low initial CO yield. On the other hand, the defects enhance the interactions between CO2 and MgO, thus further diminishing the interactions between Nit and MgO caused by CO2. They also enhance the migration of Nit to the surface during the catalytic process. Both effects lead to a quicker reduction of Nit by CH4 and/or by CO and H2. The above suggestion is in agreement with the XRD patterns of Ni-Mg-7 catalyst after reaction. These patterns reveal that the amount of Niin Ni-Mg-7 is much larger than in Ni-Mg-6 (Fig. 2b), hence that the reducibility of the former catalyst was greater than that of the latter one. One can now understand why the conversions of CI-I4 and CO2, and the CO yield increase fast with reaction time over the Ni-Mg-7 catalyst. Even though, among the catalysts investigated in the present paper, Ni-Mg-7 has the highest CO yield, the CO yield is somewhat lower than that over the catalyst based on the Aldrich MgO, investigated in our previous papers [26,27]. 204 E. Ruckenstein, YH. Hu/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 185-205 Table 4 Intensity ratio of Ni/MgO in XRD pattern Catalyst Intensity ratio of Ni/MgOa Ni-Mg- 1 0.0165 Ni-Mg-3 0.0397 Ni-Mg-4 0.0198 Ni-Mg-5 0.0429 Ni-Mg-6 0.0197 Ni-Mg-7 0.0517 a Diffraction intensities in XRD:face (100) for Ni and face(200) for MgO. The XRD data of the catalysts after reaction indicate the presence of Ni in addition to MgO (or perhaps the solid solution NiO-MgO). In Table 4, the ratio of intensities Ni/MgO calculated on the basis of the highest intensity diffraction peaks (face (100) for Ni and face (200) for MgO) are listed. Interestingly, the ratio of intensities, which constitutes a measure of the relative amount of Nihas almost the same sequence as the final CO yield. The final sequence of the CO yield is: Ni-Mg-7 > Ni-Mg-3 ~ Ni-Mg-5 > Ni-Mg-4 > Ni-Mg-6 > Ni-Mg-1. Of course, the sequence of the yields does not in general, follow, the sequence of the intensity ratio, because the activity and selectivity do not only depend on the amount of Ni but also on its dispersion. The parallelism observed in the present case is at least partially due to the same reduction treatment employed for all catalysts. 5. Conclusion It is found that the nature of the precursor and the conditions employed to prepare MgO affect the conversions of CH4 and CO2, and the CO yield over the NiO/MgO catalysts in the CO2 reforming of methane. A comparison is made among NiO/MgO catalysts based on MgO prepared by calcining Mg(NO3)2, Mg(OH)2, or [MgCO3]4Mg(OH)2 under various conditions. NiO/MgO based on MgO prepared by calcining [MgCO3]4Mg(OH)2 at a high temperature for a short time provides the highest conversions of CH4 and CO2 and the highest CO yield after an induction time of 1 h.
