Deshpande, Sunil S. Divekar, Bhalchandra M. Bhanage and Raghunath V. Chaudhari** Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411 008 (India) (Received December 17, 1991; accepted April 16, 1992) Introduction Homogeneous catalysts are extensively used in several chemical processes mainly due to their high activity and selectivity [ 11. However, their application is limited due to the problems associated with catalyst separation/recycle and deactivation. A new approach to this problem involves the use of biphasic media, such that the catalyst is soluble in one phase, and the product separates out into another phase to achieve an efficient catalyst separation. This approach has been successfully used in a commercial hydroformylation process by Ruhrchemie (21, in which a water-soluble Rh complex catalyst is used. We wish to report here some results using biphasic media for efficient catalyst recycle and recovery in the hydroformylation of allyl alcohol to 4hydroxybutyraldehyde (4-HBA) and 2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (2MHP). This reaction is also industrially important, as 4-HBA can be further hydrogenated to yield 1,4-butanediol, as shown below.

All rights reserved L20 In this paper, it is shown that the HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst, when used in the homogeneous phase, tends to deactivate on recycle. Further, the role of the second immiscible liquid phase in prolonging the activity of catalyst on recycle has been demonstrated. Materials Details regarding the catalyst used, materials etc. are as given in our earlier work [3]. Experimental Procedure The apparatus used was the same as described earlier [ 3 ]. Reactions were carried out in the homogeneous as well as biphasic mode. In the homogeneous reaction (Mode A), the catalyst, solvent and allyl alcohol were charged into the reactor and the reaction was carried out in the usual way. After completion of the reaction, the crude product was shaken with water and the product was extracted into the aqueous phase. Following this procedure, the organic phase was separated and recycled to the reactor along with a new charge of allyl alcohol to start the new reaction. This procedure was repeated to investigate the efficiency of catalyst on recycle. In the biphasic mode of operation (Mode B), the solvent,catalyst, allyl alcohol and water were charged into the reactor and the reaction continued as usual. After the reaction was completed, the organic and the aqueous phases were allowed to separate and the organic phase containing the catalyst was recycled along with a fresh aliquot of allyl alcohol for the next reaction. Results and discussion Several experiments were carried out using single-phase and biphasic solvent systems to compare the activity and selectivity of HRh(CO)(PPh3)3 catalyst during recycle. For single-phase studies, n-heptanol was used as solvent, while the biphasic solvent consisted of a n-heptanol-water mixture. The results showing the influence of the second immiscible liquid phase on catalyst efficiency and recycle are presented in Table 1. It was observed that initial activity was lower for the biphasic system than for the single phase. However, the drop in activity on recycle of catalyst was more significant in the case of the single phase. The difference in catalytic activity in the two cases is due to the different allyl alcohol concentrations present in the reactive phase. For example, in the homogenous system, the entire quantity of allyl alcohol is available in the reactive phase but in the n-heptanol-water system, most of the allyl alcohol is present in the aqueous phase and the concentration of allyl alcohol in the organic phase is dependent on its distribution in the two phases. This explains the lower average activity observed in the biphasic system. In addition, the catalyst concentration per unit volume is slightly higher in the homogeneous system compared to the biphasic system. The results indicate that the biphasic mode of operation is superior to the homogeneous mode, since the percentage drop in activity in the case L21 TABLE 1 Activity of catalyst in hydroformylation of allyl alcohol Recycle Activityb % no. activity A: Homogeneous reactions 0 3.50 100 1 2.55 92.7 2 1.83 52.3 3 1.28 36.5 4 1.01 28.6 B.

In contrast, for the biphasic system only one-third of the catalyst activity is lost during four recycles (see Table 1). It is known that aldehydes interact with the catalyst to form inactive species [4]. In the homogeneous reaction (single phase), the presence of the aldehydes and catalyst in the same phase could be a major cause for the loss of activity. On the other hand, the presence of the water in the reaction medium in the biphasic system causes the product to be extracted into water, ensuring minimal interaction of catalyst with aldehydes. These results show that it is advantageous to have a second immiscible liquid phase (water) for efficient re-use/recycle of the catalyst in the hydroformylation of allyl alcohol. The deactivation /inhibition of the catalyst is also reduced when such a biphasic system is used. Conclusions Investigations into the use of biphasic systems for hydroformylation of allyl alcohol indicate that it has several advantages over the homogeneous reactions: inactivation of catalyst is reduced and recycle of catalyst is more efficient.
