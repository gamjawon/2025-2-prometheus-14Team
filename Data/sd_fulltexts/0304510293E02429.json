The function of tartaric acid and pivalic acid in the reaction process is as follows. (1) Tartrate adsorbed on the catalyst makes an associative complex with pivalic acid and 2-alkanone through hydrogen bonding by sharing its two hydroxyl groups with the C-0 group of pivalic acid and that of the 2-alkanone. (2) The repulsion between the alkyl group of pivalic acid and that of 2-alkanone in the associative complex fixes the adsorption mode of 2-alkanone on the catalyst in such a way that one enantioface of the substrate faces the nickel surface. The experimental results, which included stereochemistry and optical yield of the reaction, were in good agreement with the prediction from the proposed reaction model. Key words: alkanones; asymmetric modification; enantioface-differentiation; hydrogenation; nickel Introduction Enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of prochiral ketones over various catalysts has been widely studied. However, there has been a limitation of substrate structure for obtaining high optical yield. Most catalysts require two polar associative interactions between substrate and catalyst (metal and substrate or ligand and substrate) [ 1 ] . In this respect, 2-alkanone is a difficult substrate to be hydrogenated in high optical yield, because it does not have functional groups except for one C=O group and it can have only a polar interaction between the catalyst and its C=O group. High optical yield was reported 'Corresponding author. Fag. (+81-857)286343. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. SSD10304-5102(93)E0242-9 334 T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 333-342 only in the case of the catalytic borane reduction of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone over optically active B-methylated oxazaborolidine [ 2 ] . However, this was limited to a highly branched substrate and no satisfactory results were achieved in the hydrogenation of straight chain 2-alkanones. Raney nickel, asymmetrically modified with an aqueous solution of tartaric acid (TA) and NaBr (TA-NaBr-MRNi), is a good heterogeneous catalyst for the enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of various kinds of prochiral ketones. This catalyst is applicable over a wide range of substrate structure compared with other homogeneous catalysts. High optical yields (7090%) were obtained even in the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones [3 ], as well as ss-ketoesters [ 4 ] , ss-ketoalcohols [ 5 ] , f-ketosulfones [ 6 ] , and ss-diketones [ 7 ] . The surface of this catalyst can efficiently differentiate the two adjacent groups to the carbonyl group in the substrate. Even the groups without the ability to form the hydrogen bond can be efficiently differentiated. Especially in the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones, the two very similar alkyl groups (methyl and ethyl, propyl, butyl,...) in the ketones can be highly differentiated (eqn. 1). CH3C(CHZ)nCH3 1~2 (S)- CH3C H(CHZ),,CH3 (1) ll (R,R) TA-NaBr-MRNi 0 OH (Optical yield around 80%) Elucidation of this functional solid surface as well as its application to the practical synthesis of optically active alcohols has become of interest in recent years. Studies of stereo-differentiation with this catalyst have been carried out mainly for the hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate (MAA). The mode of enantioface-differentiation of MAA has been proposed by us [8], Hoek and Sachtler [9 ], Klabunovakii et al. [ 10 ], Yasumori [ 11 ], Orito et al. [ 12 ], and Smith and co-workers [ 13 ] . In the enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of 2-alkanones, we have reported that the addition of a carboxylic acid, particularly pivalic acid, to the reaction media was an indispensable factor for obtaining high optical yield [ 3 ] . However, in the hydrogenation of other substrates carrying polar groups such as MAA, pivalic acid had little effect on optical yield. The addition of pivalic acid is the special feature of the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones. Therefore, the role of pivalic acid should be a key factor when considering the mechanism of the enantioface-differentiating process of 2-alkanones. In a previous paper, we have reported that one of the roles of pivalic acid was to reduce the amount of adsorbed sodium ions on the catalyst and to be a regulator to keep TA as the monosodium salt under the working conditions of the catalyst [ 14 ] . In this paper, we will present the mode of enantioface-differentiation of this catalyst focusing on the stereochemistry of the components that determine the optical yield (carboxylic acid, substrate and TA on the surface of the catalyst). T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 333-342 335 Experimental The GLC of the products was carried out with a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph. The optical rotations were measured with a JASCO DIP-370 polarimeter.1H-NMR spectra were taken with a JEOL GX-270 instrument. Materials (R*,R*) - (+) -2-Methyl tartaric acid [ 15 ] , (R,R) -3-methoxy malic acid [16], (R,R)-2,3-dimethoxy succinic acid [17], and (S)-2-hydroxyl octanoic acid [ 18 ] were prepared by previously reported methods. 0-Pivaloyl-(R,R)-tartaric acid was synthesized by the following method. TA (20 g, 0.13 mol) was dissolved in 600 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF). Pivaloyl chloride (17 g, 0.13 mol) was added to this solution dropwise and the solution was stirred for 2 days at room temperature. After removal of the solvent by evaporation, hexane was added and hexane-insoluble part was collected. After removal of hexane, ethyl acetate was added and insoluble substances were removed. Ethyl acetate was evaporated in vacuo. [ a ] D = + 0.92 (c=5, H20 ). Calcd. for CgH1407: C, 46.15; H, 6.03%. Found: C, 46.05; H, 6.11% . Tetrahydrofuran was used after distillation over sodium hydride. The other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Raney nickel (RNi) catalyst A 3.8 g sample of Raney nickel alloy (Ni : Al = 42 : 58) was slowly added to 40 ml of a 20% aqueous solution of NaOH. The solution was then allowed to stand at 100 C for 1 h. After the subsequent removal of the alkaline solution by decantation, the catalyst was washed 30 times with 30-ml portions of deionized water. Modification of the catalyst The RNi catalyst was soaked in 200 ml of aqueous solution containing modifying reagents (0.013 mol) and the stated amount of NaBr at 100 C for 1 h. The pH of this modifying solution had been adjusted to 3.2 with NaOH. After removal of the solution, the catalyst was washed successively with one 20-ml portion of water, two 100-ml portions of methanol, and two 30-ml portions of anhydrous THF. Hydrogenation of 2-alOnone The catalyst thus obtained was employed for the hydrogenation of 2-alkanone (8 g) in the reaction media: THF (20 ml) and carboxylic acid (stated in the text) under an initial hydrogen pressure of 9 X 106 Pa. The hydrogenation was carried out in a 100 ml autoclave at 60 C or 100 C. After the removal of the catalyst by decantation, the product was dissolved in 100 ml of ether and 336 T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 333-342 washed with a saturated aqueous solution of K,C03 to remove the carboxylic acid. The ether solution was then dried over anhydrous Na2S04 and concentrated in vacuo. As for 2-hexanol, 2-heptanol, 2-octanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 6-methyl-2-heptanol, simple distillation gave hydrogenated products with chemical purities of more than 98% (GLC analyses: at 70-260 C, 5% Thermon 1000 on Chromosorb W). In the case of 2-butanol, 2pentanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol, the simple distillation gave the product contaminated by the solvent. The products were further purified by preparative GLC (at 90 C, 20% PEG 20M on Chromosorb W) and subjected to the optical rotation measurement. Determination of optical yield (i) Optical purity of 2-butanol, 2-pentanol, 2-hexanol, 2-heptanol, 2-octanol, and 3-methyl-2-butanol was determined by polarimetry.

(ii) The enantiomer excess of 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 6-methyl-2-heptanol was determined by a 'H NMR method according to the procedure of Yamguchi et al. [ 21 ] . Results and Discussion Factors affecting optical yield of the reaction (1) Structure of carboxylic acid added to the reaction system Effect of the structure of carboxylic acids on optical yield were studied with 2-octanone, 3-methyl-2-butanone, and 2-butanone (Table 1). When 2octanone was used as the substrate, optical yield mainly depended on the degree of branching at the a-carbon of the acid. The more branching at the acarbon gave the higher optical yield. When 3-methyl-2-butanone was hydrogenated, existence of one branching group in the acid had little effect on optical yield. However, the acid with two branching groups of the a-carbon (pivalic acid) provided a great increase in optical yield. As for 2-butanone, addition of carboxylic acid increases optical yield, but the effect of branching group in the acid is not as significant as that in the hydrogenation of 2-octanone. From these results, the alkyl chain of the acid is expected to exist near the alkyl chain of the substrate and to take part in the enantio-differentiating process. Both the a-carbon of the acid and that of the 2-alkanone exist close enough to have T. Osawa et al. / J.

Like the a-carbon of 2-alkanone, alkyl chains far from the ss-carbon will have an interaction with the acid and this interaction will contribute to elevation of the optical yield. (2) Structure of modifying reagent Table 2 shows the relationship between the structure of the modifying reagents and optical yield in the hydrogenation of 2-octanone. In all cases with or without the presence of pivalic acid, the (R)-modifying reagent gave (S)2-octanolandthe (S)-modifying reagent gave (R)-2-octanol.Consideringthese results and the fact that all the modifying reagents in this study were the derivatives or analogs of TA, the enantioface-differentiation of 2-octanone over these catalysts will proceed via the same mechanism. Therefore, the detailed study of the structure of the modifying reagent should reveal the indispensable functional groups in the modifying reagent and the way of mutual interaction between pivalic acid and the modifying reagent. When no pivalic acid was added to the reaction media, a low optical yield was obtained irrespective of the structure of the modifying reagents. When pivalic acid was added, the optical yield changed with the change in the modifying reagent. We can classify the modifying reagents into the following three groups based on the optical yield. (1) Compounds that have two hydroxyl groups and two carboxyl groups (Entries 1 and 2). These modifying reagents lead to an 30-40% optical yield. (2) Compounds that have two carboxyl groups and one hydroxyl group (Entries 3 and 4). These modifying reagents lead to an 810% optical yield. (3) Other hydroxyl or carboxylic acids (Entries 5-8). These modifying reagents lead to the optical yield of 2% or lower. From these results, modifying reagents producing the highest optical yield in the presence of pivalic acid should be those that have a carbon skeleton of tartaric acid and that they have two carboxyl groups and two hydroxyl groups in C2 symmetry. 0Pivaloyl tartaric acid produced an exceptionally low optical yield. This indicates that the combination of the pivaloyl group to the hydroxyl group in TA 338 T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol.

Pivalic acid should have an interaction with a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group in TA by non-covalent bonds. The present results demonstrate that tartaric acid on the surface of the catalyst fixes pivalic acid by hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl and/or hydroxyl group in tartaric acid and the carboxyl group in pivalic acid. The formation of the pivalic acid-tartaric acid complex on the catalyst was essential to improve the intrinsic enantioface-differentiating ability of tartaric acid. The adsorption species of the modifying reagent had a significant effect on optical yield. As for TA, adsorption species giving high optical yield in the enantio-differentiating hydrogenation of MAA have been proved to be monosodium and/or disodium tartrate [ 22, 23 ] . In the hydrogenation of 2-alkanone, 340 T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 333-342 pivalic acid added to the reaction system reduced the amount of adsorbed sodium ions on the catalyst surface [24] and the equilibrium of sodium ions between the catalyst surface and the liquid phase was established giving monosodium tartrate as the chiral adsorption species. The C2 symmetry of TA can provide a single pivalic acid-TA-Na complex on the catalyst that functions as the best species for the enantio-differentiating hydrogenation of 2alkanone [ 14 ] . (3) Structure of substrate The hydrogenation of the substrates of various structures was carried out under the same reaction conditions (Table 3 ). As found in Table 3, the values of optical yield mainly depended on the existence of branching. Almost the same optical yields were obtained for a series of straight chain 2-alkanones. When the substrate has a branched methyl group, optical yields tend to increase depending on the change in the position of branching. With branching at the a-position of the carbonyl group, the incremental change became 25% compared to the corresponding straight chain substrate (Entries 1 and 2). Branching at the f3- and y-positions resulted in a 10% optical yield increase (Entries 3 and 4, 5 and 6). However, branching at the 8-position resulted in no increase in optical yield (Entries 7 and 8). These facts can be explained by the previous idea of fixation of pivalic acid to tartaric acid. Steric interaction of the t-butyl group in the fixed pivalic acid can affect the neighboring parts of the carbonyl group (Ca, Css, and Cy) in the substrates. This idea is also supported by the data listed in Table 1. Mode of enantioface-differentiation The mode of enantioface-differentiation in the hydrogenation of 2-alkanones can be visualized, based on the various interactions found among (R,R) TA, pivalic acid, and substrate (Fig. 1) . Orientation of TA and 2-alkanone on the catalyst surface followed our earlier model [ 25 ] . According to the X-ray or neutron diffraction analyses of the metal salts of TA, four carbon atoms in tartrate form a near planar group. Atoms of the carboxylate group (Ol, Cl, TABLE 3 Effects of structure of substrates on optical yield No. Substrate (R-CO-CH3) Optical No. Substrate (R-CO-CH3) Optical yield/ % yield/ 1 CH3CH2- 59 2 (CH3)2CH- 85 3 CH3CHZCH2- 64 4 (CH3)2CHCH2- 75 5 CH3CH2CH2CH2- 65 6 (CH3)ZCHCH2CH2- 77 7 CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2- 67 8 (CH3)ZCHCH2CH2CH2- 66 aModifying reagent: TA (2 g) and NaBr (12 g), pivalic acid (16.2 g), hydrogenation temperature: 60 C.

Mode of enantioface-differentiation. 02 ), hydroxyl oxygen (03) and C2 carbon atom also form a near planar group. The relation between two carboxylate planes is periplanar [ 26, 27 ] . We postulate that TA in such a conformation adsorbs on the nickel surface. In this stereochemical model, one of the hydroxyl groups of TA comes close to the catalyst surface (site 1) and the second is somewhat remote from the surface (site 2). TA forms an associative complex with pivalic acid through hydrogen bondings (site 2). The carbonyl group of 2-alkanone is fixed with site 1 by hydrogen bonding under the ateric effect between the alkyl group of the substrate and that of pivalic acid, and then hydrogenated to give an optically active 2-alkanol. Since pivalic acid is present in the reaction system, pivalic acid exists as a homo dimer, hetero dimer with TA and exists around the hydrophilic groups in TA. Of all these interactions, the important linkage for the effective enantio-differentiation is what we proposed in Fig. 1 and it becomes one type due to the C2 symmetry of TA. The TA-pivalic acid linkage in Fig. 1 is expected to form when a significant amount of pivalic acid is added to the reaction system; which is why a large amount of pivalic acid was required to obtain a high optical yield. This TA-pivalic acid complex can efficiently recognize the structure of the C-CO-Ca-Css-Cy site in 2-alkanone by expelling the bulky alkyl group of the substrate to the opposite side of pivalic acid. Consequently, a reface attack of hydrogen is carried out to give the (S)-alcohol in excess. The importance of the hydrogen bond between TA and the substrate, TA and pivalic acid was supported by the data about the effect of the hydrogenation temperature on optical yield. In the hydrogenation of 2-octanone, the lower hydrogenation temperature gave the higher optical yield [ 28 ] . This indicates 342 T. Osawa et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 333-342 that dissociation of the hydrogen bond would decrease and that the efficient recognition of the enantioface of the substrate would be carried out at a lower hydrogenation temperature. Optimization of the interaction among TA, pivalic acid, and substrate, and the suitable control of the hydrogenation temperature could achieve the development of a highly efficient enantio-differentiating catalyst in the hydrogenation of normal and branched 2-alkanones. This performance has still not been achieved with homogeneous catalysts.

Fax (+81-857)286343. Tadao Harada Faculty of Science and Technology, Ryukoku University, Seta, Otsu 520-21 Japan Akira Tai Faculty of Science, Himeji Institute of Technology, Kanaji, Kamigori, Hyogo 678-12 Japan The enantioface-differentiating hydrogenation of 2-alkanone over tartaric acid-NaBr-modified Raney nickel (TA-NaBr-MRNi) gave an excellent optical yield when an appreciable amount of pivalic acid coexisted with the substrate. The function of tartaric acid and pivalic acid in the reaction process is as follows. (1) Tartrate adsorbed on the catalyst makes an associative complex with pivalic acid and 2-alkalone through hydrogen bonding by sharing its two hydroxyl groups with the CO group of pivalic acid and that of the 2-alkanone. (2) The repulsion between the alkyl group of pivalic acid and that of 2-alkanone in the associative complex fixes the adsorption mode of 2-alkanone on the catalyst in such a way that one enantioface of the substrate faces the nickel surface. The experimental results, which included stereochemistry and optical yield of the reaction, were in good agreement with the prediction from the proposed reaction model.
