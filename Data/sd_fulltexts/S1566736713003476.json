The pyrolysis behavior of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, the change of crystalline structure of iron in the iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, and nitrogen chemical state of nitrogen doped carbon catalyst derived from iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound were investigated to clarify the process of improvement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity on nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst by TGA, EGA-MS, HT-XRD, XRD, and XPS technique. The ORR activity drastically improved at a synthesis temperature of 700 °C, and was the highest at a synthesis temperature of 800 °C. But the ORR activity significantly dropped at a synthesis temperature of 900 °C. This low ORR activity of NC-900 is probably due to the increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio with progression of excessive carbonization, and the quaternary nitrogen to pyridine-like nitrogen ratio might be an important factor for improvement of the ORR activity.

Keywords Catalyst Oxygen reduction Nitrogen-doped carbon Fuel cells 1 Introduction Fuel cells have been recognized as clean device due to their high thermal efficiency and low emissions. However, a large amount of platinum is used especially in cathode to stimulate the cathode reaction. The use of considerable platinum is constricting the development of the fuel cells market. To solve this problem, namely, reduce usage of platinum, catalytic activity and durability have been improved by alloying [1,2], core–shell structure [3], controlling shape and size of platinum particles [4,5], and exploiting the “support effect” [6]. On another front, a non-platinum catalyst, which is attractive from the perspective of depletion of platinum resources, has been investigated [7,8]. Nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts have been developed actively in recent years [9–12]. It is well known that carbon has a catalytic ability. In particular, nitrogen-doped carbon shows a high catalytic ability compared to carbon [13]. Zigzag edge of carbon exhibits the high density of state (DOS) in the vicinity of the Fermi level [14], and nitrogen-modified zigzag edge exhibits the high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity relative to armchair edge [15,16]. To enhance the ORR activity of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, iron or cobalt nitrogen-containing complex is usually used in synthesizing a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst for forming ORR active sites. Recently the research on indirect contribution of transition metal towards ORR [17] and on mechanistic origin of ORR on Co-modified nitrogen-doped carbon surface [18] has been reported. But, relationship between the pyrolysis behavior of iron nitrogen-containing complex and the change in nitrogen chemical state of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst has not been reported. In this paper, iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was used as a simple model of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst precursor. The pyrolysis behavior of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound and the change in nitrogen chemical state of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst were investigated to clarify association between forming process of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst and improvement of ORR activity of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst by TGA, EGA-MS, HT-XRD, XRD, and XPS technique. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation Iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was prepared by mixing an iron acetate, 1,10-phenanthroline, and ethanol, and vacuum-drying the solvent. Nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were obtained by pyrolyzing the mixture (iron acetate, 1,10-phenanthroline, phenol resin, and carbon black). The temperature of tube furnace was elevated to the temperatures of 500–900 °C in an argon gas and was held at the respective temperature for 1h. Nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were obtained by treating the pyrolyzed-mixture with 3.0M HCl solution to remove iron impurities in the pyrolyzed-mixture. In this paper, nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were denoted as NC-500, NC-600, NC-700, NC-800, and NC-900, and hereafter, were synthesized by changing the temperature. 2.2 Thermal analysis The mass-loss of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound by pyrolyzing was measured by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The gas evolved by pyrolysis of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was analyzed by evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS). The signals for masses m/z-14, 16, 18, 28, 44, 180, and 183 were recorded. The change in crystalline structure of iron in iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was evaluated using in-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction measurement (HT-XRD). HT-XRD was performed using a SPECTRIS PW3050 with HTK1200 heating stage and X' Celerator semiconducting detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.542Å) and operating at 45kV and 40mA. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements of the nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were carried out using a rotational disk electrode (RDE). ORR activities of the N-doped carbon catalysts were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), in which rotation rate was 2500rpm in O2-saturated 0.5M H2SO4 aqueous solution at 35 °C. Additionally, ORR activities of the N-doped carbon catalysts were compared on the basis of the oxygen reduction current at 0.7V and 0.9V vs. RHE, and they were normalized according to nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst weight (with carbon support). Pt/C catalyst (TANAKA KIKINZOKU, TEC10E70TPM, 67 wt.%Pt) was evaluated as reference in the same condition. 2.4 Catalyst characterizations The composition of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts was determined by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Simazu/KRATOS AXIS-HS with Al Kα radiation; the shift correction was made by setting the C1s at 284.5eV). The crystal structure of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts was evaluated by using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (XRD, Rigaku RINT-2000). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermal analysis of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound The progresses of pyrolysis of iron acetate, 1,10-phenanthroline, and iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound are shown on the TGA curves (Fig. 1 ). All samples were observed two common mass loss centered at around 100 and 250 °C which could be associated to water desorption and pyrolysis of the respective compound. TGA curve of iron acetate showed little change of mass loss above 350 °C, and the pyrolyzed residue is presumably iron metal or iron oxide. 1,10-phenanthroline completely gasified at a temperature below 300 °C. Despite the absence of mass loss of iron acetate and 1,10-phenanthroline at a temperature of above 350 °C, the significant mass loss of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was observed above 650 °C. This mass loss is due to carbonization of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, and fixed nitrogen-doped carbon rate was calculated by Eq. (1), (1) Fixed nitrogen ‐ doped carbon rate % = W B − W C W A × 100 The term WA is the weight of 1,10-phenahtroline in an iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound before TG-DTA measurement, WB is total weight of an iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound after TG-DTA measurement, and WC is the weight of residual iron metal after TG-DTA measurement. The fixed nitrogen-doped carbon rate is 12.2%. This result indicates that 1,10-phenanthroline in an iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound decomposes and carbonizes above 300 °C. TGA curve is associated to the evolved gas by pyrolyzing iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound. By monitoring the gas evolution from the heated iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, the detailed pyrolysis behavior of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound during the carbonization steps was investigated. The results of EGA-MS measurement are shown in Fig. 2 . TIC stands for total ion current and was obtained by summing the intensity of all gas fragments. Three primary peaks of TIC appeared in the range 50–100 °C, 200–400 °C, and 600–800 °C, which could be associated to water desorption, decomposition, and carbonization of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, respectively (Fig. 2-a). The m/z-18, m/z-28, and m/z-44 were detected as primary gases, and m/z-14, m/z-16, m/z-180, and m/z-183 were insensibly detected (Fig. 2-a). The m/z-14, m/z-16, m/z-180, and m/z-183 are drawn at a magnification to improve visualization of their ion chromatograms in Fig. 2-b. H2O (m/z-18) attributed to the water desorption from iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound and the decomposition of crystallization water in iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was evolved at around 100 and 250 °C. CO2 (m/z-44) from the decomposition of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was evolved at around 300 °C. The m/z-28 evolved at around 350, 600, and 700 °C is considered CO or N2 and associates to the heat-reduction of iron oxide, thermal decomposition, and carbonization of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound. Here, N (m/z-14) and O (m/z-16) were analyzed to characterize the main gas compositions of m/z-28. The shape of m/z-14 was coincided with that of m/z-28 as compared to that of m/z-16. That is, m/z-28 was composed mostly of N2. The m/z-180 and m/z-183 were slightly-detected, and the peaks of m/z-180 and m/z-183 appeared at 250 °C of the decomposition temperature of 1,10-phenanthroline. The m/z-180 is attributed to the decomposition of 1,10-phenanthroline or the iron containing product (FeN2C8) by decomposition of iron phenanthroline complex, and the m/z-183 is attributed to the decomposition of the high-molecular-weight product (e.g., C11N3H9, FeN2C8H3) formed by the decomposition and recomposition of 1,10-phenanthroline or iron phenanthroline complex. This result demonstrated the presence of the product derived from 1,10-phenanthroline above its decomposition temperature by interaction with iron. The change of iron crystalline structure during the carbonization process of 1,10-phenanthroline was investigated by means of HT-XRD. Fig. 3 shows a set of X-ray diffraction patterns measured by HT-XRD of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound. Iron oxide (Fe3O4 and FeO) was observed up to 600 °C, and iron oxide heat-reduced at 700 °C and transformed into iron carbide (Fe3C) with dissolution of carbon derived from 1,10-phenanthroline. The formation temperature of iron carbide is consistent with the mass loss of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound at around 650 °C described above. Austenite was observed above 800 °C and transformed into α-Fe with decreasing temperature. These results indicate that the carbonization of 1,10-phenanthroline occurs through the dissolution of carbon into iron and recomposition of carbon. 3.2 ORR activities of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts Nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were synthesized by the pyrolysis of the mixture (iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, phenol resin, and carbon black) at temperatures of 500–900 °C, and their ORR activities compared with TGA curve for iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound are shown in Fig. 4 . The ORR current value of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts and Pt/C catalyst as reference is listed in Table 1 . The ORR current of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts was hardly detected at 0.9V and are less than hundred part of that of Pt/C catalyst. The ORR current of the nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts was significantly detected at 0.7V and their ORR current value at 0.7V is rigorously compared in this research. Oxygen reduction current of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts drastically increased between 600 and 700 °C, and oxygen reduction current density of NC-700 increased threefold compared to that of NC-600. This temperature range is consistent with the mass loss attributed to carbonization of 1,10-phenanthroline. Moreover, from HT-XRD result, this temperature range coincides with the temperature of the formation of iron carbide (Fe3C). This result implies that ORR active sites of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst are formed through iron species during the carbonization of 1,10-phenanthroline. ORR activities of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts basically improved with increasing synthesis temperature, and NC-800 exhibited the highest activity for all catalysts. However, oxygen reduction current of NC-900 decreased about a third of that of NC-800. The XRD data of NC-600, NC-700, NC-800, and NC-900 are shown in Fig. 5-a. The C(002) peak of NC-900 shifts to high angle relative to those of the others, and the lattice spacing d(002) of NC-900 was 0.349nm. The XPS measurement results of NC-600, NC-700, NC-800, and NC-900 are shown in Fig. 5-b and Table 2 . The XPS peak of iron was not detected in all catalysts. The iron species are not in the surface vicinity of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts. The nitrogen content in nitrogen doped carbon catalysts decreases with increasing synthesis temperature. In contrast, the quaternary nitrogen ratio of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts increases with increasing synthesis temperature. These increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio and decrease in nitrogen content are attributed to the decomposition and recomposition of iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound. But the nitrogen to carbon ratio (N/C) of NC-900 did not change compared to that of NC-800, the quaternary nitrogen ratio of NC-900 increased relative to that of NC-800. This increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio means whether the change of nitrogen chemical state from pyridine-like nitrogen to quaternary nitrogen or the decrease of nitrogen content in carbon edge sites with progression of carbon crystallization. The low ORR activity of NC-900 is probably due to the increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio with progression of carbon crystallization. The ORR active sites of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst have not yet been clear, but the increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio with progression of excessive carbonization leads to low ORR activity of these catalysts. Despite of the increase in quaternary nitrogen ratio, the ORR activities improved between 600 and 800 °C. This result implies that the quaternary nitrogen to pyridine-like nitrogen ratio is an important factor to improve the ORR activity. 4 Conclusions To clarify the formation process of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst derived from iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound, iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound was used as a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst precursor and was evaluated by TGA, EGA-MS, and HT-XRD. In addition, nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts were synthesized at temperatures of 500–900 °C and evaluated by XPS, RDE technique. The carbonization of 1,10-phenanthroline in iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound especially proceeded above 650 °C. Iron in iron 1,10-phenanthroline compound transformed from iron oxide (FeO and Fe3O4) to iron carbide (Fe3C) at 700 °C. ORR activity of nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts drastically enhanced at the synthesis temperature of 700 °C and was the highest at the synthesis temperature of 800 °C. But, ORR activity of the catalyst at the synthesis temperature of 900 °C reduced relative to the catalyst synthesized at 800 °C. This low ORR activity of NC-900 is probably due to the increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio with progression of excessive carbonization. The ORR active sites of nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst has not yet been clear, but the increase of quaternary nitrogen ratio with progression of excessive carbonization leads to low ORR activity of these catalysts. Despite of the increase in quaternary nitrogen ratio, the ORR activities improved between 600 and 800 °C. This result implies that the quaternary nitrogen to pyridine-like nitrogen ratio is an important factor to improve the ORR activity.
