Post-coordination interactions (abbreviated as PCI) play an essential role in the synthesis and optimization of catalysts by influencing their coordination environment, stabilizing reaction intermediates, tuning activity, and allowing for dynamic behavior. In this work, a LaOCl incorporated into carbon-nitrogen supported metallic Co and CoFe alloy catalyst (termed as CF/L-CN-PCI) via PCI strategy has been synthesized. This catalyst was then utilized in a cascade reaction involving nitroarenes and benzyl alcohol. The developed CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibits higher catalytic selectivity compared to CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst prepared by IWI method in cascade reactions. Additionally, this catalyst offers ease of separation and demonstrates good catalytic cycle stability. Various characterization techniques and control experiments were employed to validate the reasons for the enhanced catalytic performance and to investigate the key issues such as the rate-determining step during the reaction process. We hope that this catalyst preparation method can serve as a reference for the development of other superior catalysts and their application in different reactions.

This reaction mode has many important implications including as enhancing reaction efficiency and selectivity, expanding the reaction scope, promoting the development of synthetic methodology, and providing a new pathway for achieving more efficient and sustainable synthetic chemistry [1–8]. The hydrogenation reaction of aromatic nitro compounds is one of the commonly used methods for preparing aromatic amines. This process generally involves the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds (such as nitrobenzene) to their corresponding aromatic amines (such as aniline) [9–21]. Meanwhile, the N-alkylation reaction of aromatic amines with alcohols is an important organic reaction, typically involving the interaction between aromatic amines (aromatic compounds containing amino groups) and alcohols (aliphatic compounds containing hydroxyl groups). This reaction can be used to synthesize various aromatic compounds and has broad application potential [22–24]. Therefore, the preparation of efficient catalysts for hydrogenation-alkylation cascade reactions is an important hotspot in the current research field. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are compounds known for their high surface area, tunable pore structures, and diverse functional groups. These characteristics make MOFs promising in catalysis, particularly as pyrolysis catalysts in organic catalytic reactions. The utilization of MOFs pyrolysis catalysts in organic catalytic reactions aims to enhance efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability in organic synthesis, offering substantial application potential and research significance [25–32]. The post-synthetic coordination-assisted synthesis of MOFs pyrolysis catalysts presents several compelling advantages that enhance their applicability in various catalytic processes. One of the primary benefits is the ability to incorporate auxiliary ligands during the synthesis. This flexibility allows researchers to optimize catalyst performance by carefully selecting the types, quantities, and spatial arrangements of ligands. Such precise control can lead to significant improvements in the properties of the resulting catalysts. The method contributes to increased structural stability, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity over extended periods and under challenging reaction conditions. Enhanced stability minimizes the risk of catalyst degradation and ensures consistent performance, making the catalysts more reliable for industrial applications. Additionally, by improving catalytic activity, these modified MOFs can outperform traditional catalysts, leading to more efficient reactions and potentially higher yields in organic synthesis. Post-synthetic methods also enable researchers to fine-tune the structural characteristics and functional groups of the MOFs. This fine-tuning is essential for tailoring catalysts to specific reactions or substrates, allowing for more effective catalytic processes. For instance, modifying the functional groups can enhance the interaction between the catalyst and the reactants, improving selectivity and lowering activation energies. Furthermore, the ability to design tailor-made MOF pyrolysis catalysts opens up new possibilities for exploring novel catalytic pathways and enhancing CO2 conversion processes, energy storage, and environmental remediation applications. This adaptability increases the potential of MOFs in addressing diverse challenges in chemical catalysis [33–42]. Cheng et al. modified Fe-MOFs to create quasi-MOFs, enhancing photocatalytic efficiency for hydrogenation and N-alkylation through in situ Pd photoreduction [43]. She and colleagues used adenine as a linker to synthesize Cu/Zn bimetallic MOFs, generating Cu-ZnO/NC-BMOFs for efficient hydrogenation-amination reactions [21]. Qin and collaborators developed a ZIF-67-on-UiO-66 core-shell catalyst via a surfactant method, achieving 99.5 % yield in a one-pot reaction for N-(4-methoxypheny) formamide by optimizing catalytic performance, selectivity, and efficiency in CO2 fixation [44]. Sun and collaborators developed a highly effective bifunctional catalyst, PMoV2@DETA-MIL-101, using a novel double-solvent method. This material achieved 99 % alcohol conversion in a one-pot aerobic oxidation-Knoevenagel reaction, showcasing its potential as a noble-metal-free catalyst, promoting sustainable and cost-effective organic transformations [45]. Therefore, the post-synthetic coordination-assisted synthesis of MOFs pyrolysis catalysts has important advantages in enhancing catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability, providing strong support for the realization of precision-designed, high-performance catalysts. Therefore, a one-step self-assembly synthesis of La-MOFs was adopted. As illustrated in Scheme 1 , the reaction of La(NO3)3·6H2O and LaCl3·6H2O with Schiff base ligands was occurred via solution diffusion. Examination of the single-crystal structure indicates a significant presence of uncoordinated imine groups in the La-H2salen MOFs. These imine groups typically feature nitrogen atoms carrying lone pair electrons, which confer strong coordinating capabilities in coordination chemistry. The ability of these lone pair electrons to engage in coordinate bonding with the vacant orbitals of other metal ions (e.g. Co2+, Fe3+) facilitates coordination interactions. Furthermore, the La-H2salen MOFs reacted with Co(NO3)2·5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O to form the La-H2salen@CoFe composite. Subsequently, the La-H2salen@CoFe composite was subjected to pyrolysis under a nitrogen atmosphere, resulting in the incorporation of LaOCl into a carbon-nitrogen supported CoFe catalyst (referred to as CF/L-CN-PCI). This catalyst was then utilized for the cascade reaction between nitroarenes and alcohols. 2 Experimental section The details of the experimental section are provided in the Supporting Information (SI), including the materials used in the experiment, the catalyst precursor, the preparation method of the catalyst, characterization, as well as catalytic reactions and product analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalyst precursor As illustrated in Fig. S1, the XRD pattern of La-H2salen aligns with the previously reported pattern for Ce-H2salen, thereby confirming the homogeneity of the crystalline samples [46,47]. Additionally, to investigate the morphology and surface elemental distribution of the La-H2salen MOFs, STEM (Fig. S2), TEM (Fig. S3), HAADF-STEM-EDS (Fig. S4), and line scan analysis (Fig. S5) were performed. As shown in Fig. 3b, the measured distance between adjacent lattice fringes is approximately 0.317 nm, which corresponds to the closest intermolecular distances of the benzene rings in the H2salen organic linker. This observation is consistent with our previously reported findings [46]. Furthermore, to confirm the reaction between La-H2salen MOFs and Co(NO3)2·5H2O as well as Fe(NO3)3·6H2O, the XPS and FT-IR were employed to characterize the above-mentioned samples. As depicted in Fig. 1 a, the survey spectrum revealed the presence of elements including as La, Co, Fe, N, C and Cl in the La-H2salen MOFs. To verify the interaction between the La-H2salen MOFs and Co(NO3)2·5H2O as well as Fe(NO3)3·6H2O, the N 1s XPS analysis was conducted. For La-H2salen@CoFe sample, the appearance of specie (399 eV, -C=N-Co/Fe) formed by the coordination of imine with Co2+ and Fe3+ ions suggests that imine (-C=N-) has strong coordination ability. Moreover, from the FT-IR (Fig. 1c), it was observed that the La-H2salen MOFs exhibited an absorption vibration peak of imine at 1640 cm-1. However, for the La-H2salen@CoFe, a significant blue shift was observed in the imine stretching vibration peak, from 1640 to 1616 cm-1, indicating a clear chemical coordination between the imine groups in La-H2salen MOFs and Co(NO3)2·5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O [47]. In addition, from Fig. 1b, it can be observed that the color of the powder of La-H2salen@CoFe changed significantly after reacting with Co(NO3)2·5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O, compared to its pure La-H2salen MOFs. This indicates a significant chemical interaction between La-H2salen MOFs and Co(NO3)2·5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O, which is consistent with above XPS and FT-IR results. 3.2 Characterization and performance of as-prepared catalysts The XRD analysis was performed to help determine the crystalline phase compositions of the La-H2salen@CoFe precursor derived catalyst, understand its crystal structure and properties, and provide important references for studying the performance and activity of the derived CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 2 a, the diffraction peaks observed at 44.1° is attributed to metallic Co, while the peak at 44.7° corresponds to the CoFe alloy [48,49]. The remaining diffraction peaks are attributed to LaOCl. In the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst, the intensity ratio of metallic Co to CoFe alloy was lower than that observed in CF/L-CN-IWI. This observation suggests that the PCI strategy facilitates the dispersion of CoFe alloy, which is advantageous for enhancing the performance of CF/L-CN-PCI in cascade reaction. Raman analysis serves as a crucial tool for elucidating the structure-function relationships in catalytic systems, helping chemists to optimize catalyst formulations for improved performance. The ratio of the intensity of the D band (I D) to the intensity of the G band (I/G) in Raman spectroscopy provides insight into the structural properties of the as-prepared catalysts. For D band (disorder band), which typically appears around 1350 cm-1 and is associated with defects and disorder in the carbon structure. It is activated by the presence of defects and is considered a hallmark of sp2 carbon atoms that are not perfectly ordered. The G band (graphene band) is found around 1580 cm-1 and corresponds to the stretching of the C-C bond in graphitic materials. It is indicative of the graphitic content and reflects the degree of order within the carbon structure [50]. As illustrated in Fig. 2b and Table 1 , the I D/I G ratios for the CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts are measured at 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. This indicates that the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst possesses slightly more defects, which may contribute to improved performance in cascade reactions. Further evaluation of the CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts was conducted to assess their performance in the cascade reaction between nitroarenes and alcohols. First, performance tests were conducted without adding a catalyst, and no products were detected, indicating that the cascade reaction cannot occur in the absence of a catalyst. The catalytic results revealed that both the CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts achieved 100 % conversion of nitrobenzene. Specifically, the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibited 25 % selectivity towards aniline and 75 % towards N-phenylbenzylamine. In contrast, the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst displayed 58 % selectivity for aniline and 42 % for N-phenylbenzylamine. These results suggest that the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst, prepared via the PCI method, is more effective than the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst, which was prepared using the IWI method. Additionally, increasing the reaction temperature and duration can enhance the selectivity of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst towards N-phenylbenzylamine, achieving 100 % selectivity. From the above catalytic results, the nitrobenzene achieved a 100 % conversion rate during the hydrogenation process with both catalysts; therefore, comparison and kinetic experiments were conducted throughout the entire reaction process. As illustrated in Fig. 3 b, the results from the comparison experiments indicate that the selectivity for N-phenylbenzylamine in the nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol tandem reaction is similar to that in the reaction between aniline and benzyl alcohol. This suggests that the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline occurs rapidly, which further implies that the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol is the rate-determining step of the whole cascade reaction. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the kinetic concentration-time profiles represent the sequential reaction process, comprising the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline and the subsequent N-alkylation of aniline to N-phenylbenzylamine. The catalytic results indicated that nitrobenzene underwent complete reduction to form aniline, along with a small amount of N-phenylbenzylamine, within 40 min. This was followed by the N-alkylation of aniline to N-phenylbenzylamine over the next 480 min. All of data suggested that the N-alkylation of aniline with benzyl alcohol is the rate-determining step of the entire cascade reaction process. The structure of catalysts is observed through TEM, which is a key analytical method that can provide information on the morphology, composition, and crystalline properties of catalysts at the nanoscale. Compared to the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst, the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst does not exhibit significant sintering phenomena. This indicates that the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst is capable of maintaining particle stability during high-temperature or prolonged use. The smaller particle size of the nanoparticles on the surface of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst enhances the catalyst's reaction activity and selectivity. This smaller particle size not only increases the number of active sites but also improves the contact area between the reactants and the catalyst, thereby increasing the reaction rate and enhancing the overall catalytic performance. The HRTEM analysis of the crystalline structure of CF/L-CN-PCI (Fig. 4 c, 4f) indicates that the observed lattice fringes, exhibiting d spacings of 0.208 and 0.298 nm correspond to the metallic Co/CoFe alloy and LaOCl, respectively, which is consistent with above XRD analysis. The XPS is a powerful surface analytical technique employed to study the elemental composition, chemical state, and electronic state of the as-prepared catalysts, which is crucial for understanding the active sites and overall catalytic behavior [51]. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the spectra of CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts primarily consist of two doublet peaks located approximately at 835 and 855 eV, which are assigned to the principal peaks of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2, respectively [52]. In comparison to the binding energies of the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst (855.4 and 851.7 eV, respectively), the observed shift of the La 3d3/2 binding energy (855.6 and 851.9 eV, respectively) toward higher values suggests that the preparation methods towards PCI and IWI affect the extent of metal-support interactions in the catalyst. Simultaneously, the XPS results of two catalysts for Co 2p (Fig. 5b) and Fe 2p (Fig. 5c) exhibit a similar trend to that observed for La 3d XPS. The surface contents of Co at 1.17 at% and Fe at 0.51 at% in CF/L-CN-PCI are lower than those in the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst, which exhibit Co and Fe contents of 2.04 and 1.12 at%, respectively. This difference persists even though both CF/L-CN-PCI (5.6 and 5.9wt% for metallic Co and Fe, respectively) and CF/L-CN-IWI (5.8 and 6.1wt% for metallic Co and Fe, respectively) catalysts contain similar overall metal loads of Co and Fe analyzed by ICP-OES (Table 1). All of data further indicates a strong interaction between the active components of the CF/L-CN-PCI and CF/L-CN-IWI catalysts and the supports. Furthermore, the N 1s spectra of two catalysts were also analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibits the presence of Co-N species at a binding energy of 399.4 eV, in contrast to the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst. This observation indicates that the PCI strategy for catalyst preparation significantly enhances metal-support interactions and improves the dispersion of active components within the catalyst compared to the conventional IWI method. In addition, as shown in Table 1, There exists a notable difference in the surface (3.40 at%) and bulk (4.8 wt%) contents of nitrogen as well as pyrrolic N (1.4 at%) in CF/L-CN-PCI compared to those in CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst (3.67 at%, 2.6 wt% and 0.35 at%, respectively), indicating that different preparation methods have a significant impact on the nitrogen content on the catalyst surface. HADDF-STEM-EDS is a combination of techniques that allows for the detailed analysis of elemental composition and distribution in materials at the nanoscale. As shown in Fig. 6 , the elemental distribution and composition on the surface of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst were analyzed using HADDF-STEM-EDS. For CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst, the surface distribution of Co and Fe elements exhibits good dispersion on the surface of La element, with no apparent sintering phenomena observed. This indicates that the using of the PCI strategy significantly enhances the dispersion of the active components in the derived CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst. Furthermore, the EDS analysis results indicate that the surface contents towards elements of Co and Fe in the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst are 0.9 and 0.4 wt%, respectively, which are considerably lower than the values obtained from the bulk analysis of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst (5.6 and 5.9 %, respectively, determined by ICP). This further demonstrates that the PCI strategy plays a critical role throughout the preparation process of CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst. Furthermore, HADDF-STEM-EDS analysis was performed on the reference CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst (Fig. S6). The results indicated that the active metals on the surface of the CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst experienced some degree of sintering. Additionally, the EDS analysis revealed that, while the Co content on the surfaces of both catalysts was similar, the content of Fe (2.4 wt%) in the reference CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst was significantly higher than that in the developed CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst (0.4 wt%). This finding suggests that the different preparation methods have a substantial impact on the distribution of active components on the catalyst surface, which subsequently influences the catalyst's performance during reactions. 3.3 Reaction mechanism, recyclability test and characterization of fresh and spent catalysts The interaction between the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst and nitrobenzene (termed as NB) was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the peaks at 1347.5 and 1524.9 cm⁻¹ were assigned to the characteristic vibrational modes of the nitro (NO2) group in the nitrobenzene molecule. In this study, the samples of nitrobenzene adsorbed on the surface of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst, varying with time, are labeled as NB/Cat PCI -T, where T represents the adsorption time in minutes. As depicted in Fig. 7a, compared to the positions of the nitro functional group in pure nitrobenzene (1347.5 and 1524.9 cm-1, respectively) and the results of full width at half maximum (FWHM), the nitrobenzene molecules adsorbed on the surface of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibit a slight shift (1346.1 and 1524.9 cm-1, respectively, in NB/Cat PCI -2). This indicates that a certain degree of chemical interaction occurs between nitrobenzene and the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst. Additionally, with the prolongation of adsorption time, the chemical shift of the nitro group in the adsorbed nitrobenzene gradually moves to lower frequencies, while its half-peak width progressively broadens. This further confirms the presence of strong interactions between nitrobenzene molecules and the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst. Subsequently, the cyclic stability tests of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst for cascade reaction was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 7b, the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibits strong magnetic properties, allowing for its separation from the reaction system using a simple magnet. The separated CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst can be reused for subsequent cyclic tests after a straightforward washing and drying process. The results of the cyclic tests indicate that after nine cycles, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst did not show significant decline, demonstrating the high stability of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7d, the FT-IR characterization was conducted on both fresh and spent CF/L-CN-PCI catalysts. The infrared spectra reveal that there are no significant changes in the vibrational stretching peaks between the fresh and reacted catalysts, indicating the good stability of the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst. Additionally, the TEM analysis of the spent CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst indicated that there was no significant sintering of the catalyst following the cascade reaction (Fig. S7). Furthermore, to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of the hydrogenation-alkylation cascade reaction involving nitrobenzene and phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) facilitated by the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst, researchers conducted comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies to gain a thorough understanding of the various steps and catalytic processes involved in this reaction [32,38]. The reaction mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 7e, clearly delineates the details of the catalytic process. Initially, nitrobenzene (NB) molecules are adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst and subsequently diffuse to the active sites. This step is crucial for the effective progression of the reaction, as the time the adsorbed nitrobenzene molecules remain on the catalyst surface influences the rate of subsequent reactions. Following this, the metallic cobalt and its CoFe alloy play a significant role by activating H2 molecules, transforming them into highly reactive H species. This transformation is primarily attributed to the superior capability of CoFe alloy to dissociate H2, enabling the effective conversion of hydrogen gas molecules into hydrogen atoms participating in the subsequent reactions. Subsequently, the active hydrogen species interact with the adsorbed nitrobenzene on the catalyst surface, triggering a hydrogenation reaction that produces aniline (AN). The rapid hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is particularly important in the catalytic process, as it effectively suppresses the potential condensation reaction between nitrobenzene and hydroxylamine, thereby preventing the formation of azobenzene (AZO) and enhancing the selectivity toward the desired product. Meanwhile, under specific reaction conditions, the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst also facilitates the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to phenylacetaldehyde. This step is equally critical, as the produced phenylacetaldehyde can subsequently participate in further reactions, promoting product formation. In this series of reactions, the following steps involve aldol condensation and subsequent hydrogenation processes, which collectively lead to the final production of N-phenylbenzylamine. In addition, the N-alkylation of substituted nitroarenes with various alcohols catalyzed by CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst were also optimized. The catalytic results indicate that the CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibits good catalytic universality (Table S1). 4 Conclusions A La-based MOFs containing a large number of uncoordinated imine groups was synthesized using the solution diffusion method. The La-based MOFs was used as “carrier” to synthesis of catalyst precursor through coordination with Co(NO3)2·5H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O (La-H2salen@CoFe). Subsequently, La-H2salen@CoFe was subjected to pyrolysis under nitrogen, resulting in the formation of LaOCl incorporated into a carbon-nitrogen-supported Co and CoFe alloy catalyst (termed as CF/L-CN-PCI). The CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to the traditional CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst in the cascade reaction involving nitroarenes and benzyl alcohol. Comparative experimental results indicate that throughout the entire hydrogenation-alkylation cascade reaction process, the hydrogenation reaction occurs rapidly, whereas the alkylation reaction is relatively slow and serves as the rate-limiting step. Simultaneously, based on various characterization results, it has been confirmed that the PCI strategy can promote the formation of CoFe alloy. A higher nitrogen content helps improve the charge transfer ability of the catalyst. Additionally, the PCI strategy can enhance the metal-support interactions, thereby increasing the stability of the catalyst in cascade reactions. Therefore, the adoption of post-synthesis strategies not only accelerates the development process of novel catalysts but also facilitates the reusability and functional expansion of catalysts across different reaction systems.

        "dc:description": "Post-coordination interactions (abbreviated as PCI) play an essential role in the synthesis and optimization of catalysts by influencing their coordination environment, stabilizing reaction intermediates, tuning activity, and allowing for dynamic behavior. In this work, a LaOCl incorporated into carbon-nitrogen supported metallic Co and CoFe alloy catalyst (termed as CF/L-CN-PCI) via PCI strategy has been synthesized. This catalyst was then utilized in a cascade reaction involving nitroarenes and benzyl alcohol. The developed CF/L-CN-PCI catalyst exhibits higher catalytic selectivity compared to CF/L-CN-IWI catalyst prepared by IWI method in cascade reactions. Additionally, this catalyst offers ease of separation and demonstrates good catalytic cycle stability. Various characterization techniques and control experiments were employed to validate the reasons for the enhanced catalytic performance and to investigate the key issues such as the rate-determining step during the reaction process. We hope that this catalyst preparation method can serve as a reference for the development of other superior catalysts and their application in different reactions.",
