Graphical abstract Highlights ► HRP-dendron nanoparticle was used as a stabilized biocatalyst for 2,5-dimethoxyaniline polymerization. ► A bi-catalyst system containing stabilized HRP and FeCl3 was introduced for nanostructured poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline) synthesis. ► Rod-like nanostructures was achieved in polymerization at elevated temperature in bi-catalyst system. Synthesis of poly(2,5-dimethoxyanilie) (PDMA) catalyzed by nano reengineered horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with dendritic macromolecules, was studied as a function of reaction media. UV–vis, gel permeation chromatography and conductivity measurements were used to explain how the reaction media compositions influence the physical properties of PDMA. Nanostructured PDMA was also synthesized by oxidative polymerization in a novel and green bi-catalyst system involving HRP and ferric chloride. FTIR and UV–vis analysis confirmed the formation of emeraldine salt state of PDMA. The thermal stability of reengineered HRP granted further studies on the polymerization using bi-catalyst system at temperature of 50°C. The scanning electron microscopy images showed the changes in the morphology of synthesized PDMA from nanoporous structures to rod-like shapes by increasing the reaction temperature. Keywords Horseradish peroxidase 2,5-Dimethoxyaniline Enzymatic polymerization Thermal stability Bi-catalyst polymerization 1 Introduction Over the last few decades, the use of enzymes as biocatalysts in synthesis of polymers (enzymatic polymerization) has gained great attention. Because of the inherent chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivity of enzymes [1], polymers with well-defined structures can be prepared through enzymatic polymerization in an environmentally benign process with higher yield in comparison with chemical routes [2–4]. Several oxidoreductases (peroxidase, laccase, bilirubin oxidase, etc.) have been reported to catalyze the oxidative polymerization of OH and NH2 functionalized aromatic compounds [5–13]. Among them horseradish peroxidase has been extensively used for polymerization of aromatic amines such as aniline and its substituted derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant [9,14]. Recently, polyaniline and its derivatives have received significant attention because of their good stability and electrical/optical properties [2,15], which are attractive for technological applications in LEDs, lightweight batteries, microelectronics, electrochromic displays, electromagnetic shielding, sensors and so forth [16–19], and hence biocatalytic synthesis of these polymers is of interest. An important drawback of the enzymatic polymerization is that, at the moment the polymer begins to form, it precipitates out of the aqueous solution (where the enzymatic processes occurs), and only very low molecular weight polymers (oligomers) are produced [3,20]. To improve that, various modified methods have been investigated including solvent mixtures [10,20], modified monomers with better solubility in aqueous solutions [3], micelles [21], reverse micelles, vesicles [22] and polymerizations at air water interface [23]. All these methods have associated difficulties, but polymerization in mixed solvent is the simplest. A critical consideration in the field of enzymatic polymerization in mixed solvent is enzyme stability. An enzyme with enhanced stability and activity in harsh conditions such as organic media could be used as efficient biocatalyst for polymerization in aqueous–organic mixture. Based on this concern, in the present work we have explored a new approach to polyaniline synthesis using stabilized reengineered HRP. Recently, we have developed a new enzyme modification method containing a preparation of HRP-dendron single enzyme nanoparticles (dendrozyme) with enhanced organic tolerance and elevated temperature stability [24]. In the present work, the dendrozyme was used for oxidative polymerization of 2,5-dimethoxyaniline in various mixtures of water and ethanol (as a green organic solvent) and the effect of ethanol presence in the reaction mixture on the yield of polymerization, polymer molecular weight and conductivity were evaluated. The 2,5-dimethoxyaniline (DMA) is an aniline substituted derivative with two methoxy groups in ortho and meta positions. This structure provides better solubility and steric hindrance to minimize ortho coupling. Thus, a paradirected ring to ring reaction can proceed without any template [20,25]. It has been reported that poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline) (PDMA) has a conductivity similar to that of PANI and is soluble in most organic solvents [26,27]. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is a green catalyst that used for polymerization of aniline and its derivatives with hydrogen peroxide [28,29] or ozone [30] as oxidant agent, solely or in bi-catalyst manner. Mavundla et al. [31] reported the formation of nanophase hexagonal polyaniline and PDMA using a mixture of FeCl3 and ammonium persulfate. In the second part of this research, the effect of adding FeCl3 to enzymatic polymerization system on the product structure and morphology was investigated. This green bi-catalyst system containing HRP dendrozyme and FeCl3 for DMA polymerization was, to the best of our knowledge, investigated for the first time. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials HRP (E.C.1.11.1.7), 2,5-dimethoxyaniline (99.5% pure), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS), 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) were purchased from Merck (Germany). Polyester-32-hydroxyl-1-carboxyl bis-MPA Dendron (Generation 5, Mw 3617) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, USA. All other chemicals and solvents used were also commercially available, of analytical grade or better, and used as received. 2.2 Enzymatic polymerization First, the HRP was stabilized with bio-conjugation of polyester dendron molecules as described in our previous paper [24]. Briefly, dendron was dissolved in MES buffer (pH 6.0) at the concentration of 1mg/mL. EDC and sulfo-NHS were added to reach the final concentration of 2mM for EDC and 5mM for sulfo-NHS. They were mixed and reacted for 15min at room temperature. Then, HRP solution (1mg/mL in 0.1M phosphate buffer of pH 7.5) was added and mixed for at least 2h followed by purification of the fabricated HRP-dendron nanoparticles. We have named it dendrozyme. The enzymatic polymerizations were typically carried out at room temperature in a 20mL mixture of phosphate citrate solution of pH 3 (0.1M) and ethanol with various volume portions (0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40) which contained DMA monomer with concentration of 0.1mmol. To the solution, 0.1mL of dendrozyme stock solution (10mg/mL) was then added. To initiate the reaction, a stoichiometric amount of diluted hydrogen peroxide (0.3wt%) was added drop wise under vigorous stirring over a period of 1.5h (to avoid inhibition of HRP due to excess amount of hydrogen peroxide). The reaction was then left stirring for at least 1h. Finally, the dark green resultant solution was dialyzed (cutoff molecular weight 2000) against deionized water for at least 12h to remove any unreacted monomers, oligomers, and salts. The unreacted DMA concentration in the dialysis solution was determined by HPLC analysis to find the yield of polymerization. In the next part of study, to investigate the effect of addition of another catalyst (FeCl3) to enzymatic polymerization system on the PDMA product, 0.02g of FeCl3 was added to the reaction mixture (with mentioned conditions in above) under stirring before reaction initiation with hydrogen peroxide. A portion of each resultant PDMA samples in different parts of research, were washed with DI water (after dialysis) and then freeze dried for further characterizations (in which samples should be in the powder form) such as FTIR, GPC, conductivity evaluation and SEM analysis. 2.3 Characterization techniques All UV–vis spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer lambda950, USA). Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectra of PDMA were recorded on a Nicolet 320 FTIR spectrometer, using KBr pellets. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was done on a DMF column calibrated with polystyrene standards. The conductivity of the synthesized PDMA samples was measured by a typical four-probe method. The samples in powder form were compressed to form a pellet with 5mm of thickness and 10mm of diameter for the conductivity test. Polymer morphology was imaged using a FE-SEM (Hitachi, Japan), with a field emission gun operated at 15keV. To acquire images, the sample was placed on the sample holder and coated with gold using a Denton Vacuum Desk II sputter coater. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Enzymatic polymerization The general procedure for enzymatic polymerization of 2,5-dimethoxyaniline is schematically depicted in Scheme 1 . When enzymatic polymerization of 2,5-dimethoxyaniline was carried out either in aqueous or partially organic medium, the reaction solution turned to dark green within a few minutes following the addition of first portion of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, which indicated the formation of conductive emeraldine salt (ES) of PDMA. Fig. 1 shows the UV–vis spectra of PDMA synthesized in various solvent compositions with different volume fractions of ethanol. In all cases the formation of ES form of PDMA was confirmed by the absorption peak at around 800nm. This absorption peak is related to the polaron band transition. The overall trend of UV–vis spectra of synthesized PDMAs revealed that only paradirected coupling was performed. This means that synthesized PDMA has linear structure without any branching or crosslinking as no peak existed between 500 and 600nm in the spectra, which is assigned to branched low molecular weight polymer [10]. The steric hindrance provided by DMA monomer structure was the main cause of performing paradirected coupling [20]. The role of organic solvent in the polymerization of DMA was revealed from the intensity of polaron peak around 800nm. By increasing the volume fraction of ethanol, the solubility of DMA monomers and oligomers increases. Therefore, the polymerization could be performed more efficiently. On the other hand, enzymes can be inactivated in the presence of organic solvents. This means that by increasing the organic portion of the reaction solvent, the activity of HRP decreases. In this research the stabilized HRP (dendrozyme), used for enzymatic polymerization, could retain its activity and had a longer half life when exposed to a higher volume fraction of organic solvent in comparison with free HRP as shown in Fig. 2 . This significant organic stability could be attributed to the dendron molecules attached to the HRP surface in dendrozyme through which the enzyme conformation and essential water layer around its molecule could be preserved in the presence of organic solvent [24]. The best ethanol concentration for polymerization was found to be 35vol.%. This optimum solvent composition was resulted from two opposing effects of the increase in ethanol ratio: (1) increase in solubility of DMA monomers/oligomers and (2) decrease in HRP stability. This is a higher volume percent of organic solvent in comparison with the conditions that the free HRP was used for polymerization which was 15vol.% (results not shown). The molecular weight investigations from GPC also revealed the advantages of using organic solvent tolerant dendrozyme in enzymatic polymerization. As shown in Table 1 the higher molecular weight could be achieved in higher organic solvent concentrations by utilizing the dendrozyme as biocatalyst. The synthesis of such PDMAs in mild conditions is considerable. The steric hindrance of methoxy groups in DMA limits the formation of PDMA with a very high molecular weight. The conductivity measurements of PDMA samples synthesized in various solvent compositions showed a relationship between the molecular weight and conductivity. As the molecular weight of PDMA increased, its conductivity also increased slightly which is another advantage of using stabilized biocatalyst. Fig. 3 shows the ionic properties of synthesized PDMA by varying pH during the titration. Concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added to make the solution either acidic or basic. In an acidic solution with pH 3, PDMA has a polaron transition peak at around 800nm, whereas by adding NaOH, this polaron peak gradually decreases and finally at pH 11 totally diminishes and a new excitation peak at around 550nm appears. The color of polymer solution also changes from green at pH 3 to purple at pH 11. The titration from basic pH 11 to acidic pH 3 with HCl shows opposite behavior. 3.2 Synthesis of PDMA using bi-catalyst system (dendrozyme-FeCl3) PDMA was also synthesized in a bi-catalyst system using dendrozyme and FeCl3 together for catalyzing the oxidation polymerization of DMA monomer with H2O2 as oxidant at room temperature. The resultant PDMA was in the ES form with a dark green color and characteristic polaron transition peak at around 800nm (UV–vis spectrum not shown). The FTIR analyses of synthesized PDMA with dendrozyme and dendrozyme-FeCl3 are shown in Fig. 4 . Bands around ∼1600 and 1500cm−1 are assigned to nonsymmetric C6 ring vibration bands representing the quinoid ring and benzenoid ring, respectively. The approximate value of I 1600/I 1500 is about unit that defines the emeraldine type structure which provides higher conductivity [32]. The bands around 1200 and 1000cm−1 are attributed to OCH3 groups of DMA [20]. There is no significant difference between the FTIR spectra of enzymatic and bi-catalyst synthesized PDMAs. It means that in both methods PDMA is in the conductive ES form which could also be realized from the dark green color of resultant polymer solution in both methods. These results are in good agreement with UV–vis spectroscopy results. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the PDMA synthesized under various catalyst conditions are shown in Fig. 5 . It clearly indicates that PDMA synthesized in bi-catalyst system at room temperature has considerable nanostructure as seen in Fig. 5c. No nanostructures were formed when dendrozyme (modified HRP) or FeCl3 were used alone as the catalyst for oxidation as shown in Fig. 5a and b. The formation mechanism of nanostructures of PDMA is not clearly understood. It has been suggested in related researches by Mavundla [31], Jang [33] and Sun [34] that the micellar intermediates cause the formation of polymeric nanostructures. The existence of ions, salts or organic acids in high concentration could help the formation of amphiphilic anilinium ions and subsequently leads to formation of micelles. The polymerization takes place at the micelle/water interface because the oxidant system used is water soluble. As polymerization continues, the micelles become large spheres by accretion or rods by elongation [34]. We propose that the formation of micelles is as a result of the high concentration of Cl− ions which resulted in substituted anilinium ions. 3.3 Effect of temperature on nanostructure of synthesized polymer The enzyme-FeCl3 polymerization was also performed at elevated temperature of 50°C. As seen in Fig. 6 the rod-like structures were formed using a bi-catalyst polymerization at higher reaction temperature (50°C). From comparison of this structure with the resultant nanoporous structure in bi-catalyst polymerization at room temperature (Fig. 5c), it could be found that elongation of micelles occurred at higher temperatures. It is noteworthy that the significant thermal stability of dendrozyme (described in our previous study) granted the above investigation [24]. These results show the superior performance of HRP-dendron nanoparticle as a biocatalyst in the organic media and elevated temperatures. 4 Conclusions (i) Nano reengineered HRP with attached dendron molecules to enzyme surface (dendrozyme) was used for enzymatic polymerization of 2,5-dimethoxyaniline in mixed reaction media with various ethanol concentrations. Based on molecular weight (GPC analysis), conductivity and yield of polymerization the optimum volume ratio of ethanol was found to be 35%. (ii) The synthesis of poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline) by combining the two catalysts, HRP and ferric chloride, gave rise to polymers in the emeraldine salt state with nanostructured morphology as observed from the SEM analysis. It was found that by increasing the reaction temperature from room temperature to 50°C, rod-like morphology appeared instead of the previously observed nanoporus structure. (iii) These studies could be conducted because of the significant organic tolerance and thermal stability of reengineered HRP as an efficient biocatalyst. References [1] J. Kadokawa S.
