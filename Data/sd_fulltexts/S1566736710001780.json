Tel.: +86 10 64411443; fax: +86 10 64444919. Polyaniline-intercalated layered manganese oxide (PANI-MnO2) nanocomposite was synthesized via the delamination/reassembling process. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that the surface of the multilayer film was smooth and dense. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the basal spacing of PANI-MnO2 was 1.64nm. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that electrons could be efficiently shuttled between MnO2 and the electrode. At 0.9V the PANI-MnO2 electrode versus standard calomel electrode, about 50% of rhodamine B was degraded within 70min under visible light irradiation. Keywords Photoelectrocatalysis Layered manganese oxide Polyaniline Rhodamine B Delamination/reassembling process 1 Introduction Layered manganese oxide as an important functional material has been widely studied over the past decades, for example in catalysts, supercapacitors, magnetic materials, batteries, sensors, and others [1–10]. It is one of the most attractive candidates for electrochemical electrode materials because of its large surface, novel electrochemical property, environmental friendliness, and low cost [11,12]. Layered manganese oxide can provide stable negative charge, and the layer surfaces can easily absorb the bulky guest cations or positive polymer molecules. Many layered nanocomposite materials have been synthesized by the intercalated process. For instance, Zhou et al. [13] succeeded in preparing a lysine-intercalated manganese oxide nanocomposite with a basal spacing of 1.24nm. They prepared H-Birnessite with a basal spacing of 0.72nm. Wang and his group [14] prepared polyaniline-intercalated manganese oxide, and the prepared composite showed high power performance as a cathode material for lithium batteries. Zhang et al. [15] synthesized polyaniline-intercalated layered manganese oxide and obtained enhanced specific capacitance. In their study, large specific capacitance was obtained due to synergetic effects from each pristine component. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxidation has been proven an efficient method in degrading organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the application of photoelectrocatalysis toward the treatment of organic contaminants under visible light irradiation. Zhao et al. [16] revealed that the Bi2WO6 nanoflake film electrode degrade 4-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation. The degradation efficiency was 59% at the bias potential of 2.0V for 12h. Recently some researchers [17] used layered manganese oxide-modified diatomite to remove basic and reactive dyes from aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB), hydrolysed reactive black, and hydrolysed reactive yellow was 320, 419, and 204mg/g, respectively. Chen and He [18] synthesized manganese oxide nanostructures and applied them to water treatment. These nanostructures showed better adsorption capacity for MB than MCM-22, and could remove about 80% of MB (100mgL−1, 20mL) within 120min. Many studies have been carried out in this field. Nevertheless attempts to increase the efficiency of photoelectrocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation have been few, and there is still much work to be done. Metal bipyridyl complexes have been widely studied in photocatalysts, photosensitizers, and ion exchangers [19–22]. Hu and Rusling [23] reported that surfactant-clay composites may provide systems in which it is possible to electrochemically address metal bipyridyl redox centers between the clay layers. Metal bipyridyl complexes intercalated directly between clay layers were considered to be electrochemically silent [24,25]. Nicolas [26] studied the electrochemical behaviour of Fe(bpy)3 2+ and found a single reversible one-electron system. Such a redox process was assigned to the oxidation of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) system. In this study, we prepared a polyaniline-intercalated manganese oxide nanocomposite by the delamination/reassembling process, and investigated the photoelectrocatalytic ability of this polyaniline-intercalated layered manganese oxide electrode for the degradation of RhB at different bias potentials. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents Tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution (25%), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (HCTA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co. Ltd. Polyaniline (PANI) was purchased from DuPont. All other reagents were received as analytical grade (purchased from Beijing Chemical Plant) and were used without further purification. Double-distilled deionized water was used throughout the study. 2.2 Preparation of PANI-MnO2 by delamination/reassembly process The colloidal solution of layered manganese oxide was prepared according to the method reported by Liu and coworkers [27]. HCTA aqueous solution was added into 100mL of the colloidal solution of manganese oxide so that the ratio of HCTA (mol) to manganese oxide (mol) was 0.5. After being stirred for 24h at 40°C, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with excess of water and acetone, and then dried at 50°C for 12h. The product was designated as HCTA-MnO2. 0.25g of HCTA-MnO2 was put into 40mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and sonicated for 60min, while 0.05g of PANI was added to 20mL of NMP and sonicated for 60min. The PANI-NMP colloid was added to the HCTA-MnO2 suspension, and the reaction mixture was sonicated for 30min. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 24h at 40°C, filtered, washed with acetone and NMP, and dried at 50°C for 12h. The product was designated as PANI-MnO2. The preparation process of PANI-MnO2 is illustrated in Scheme 1 . 2.3 Characterization techniques The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken with a Hitachi S4700 SEM (Hitachi Limited). X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 instrument (Rigaku Corporation), using Cu Kα radiation (40kV and 200mA) between 3° and 40° with a scanning rate of 5°min−1. The visible light was from a 500W tungsten lamp (Beijing Lighting Research Institute) with a 420nm cutoff filter (49.5mW/cm2, Shanghai Coloured Optical Glass Co. Ltd.). The electrode performance was measured in a beaker-type electrochemical cell equipped with the working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a standard calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by mixing 70wt.% active material, 20wt.% acetylene black, and 10wt.% PEG in NMP. The resulting slurry was spread onto an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with 1cm2 geometric area. The electrochemical measurements were made using a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd.). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 SEM measurements Fig. 1a shows the SEM images of the H-Birnessite on glass substrate. Fig. 1b is the view of the PANI-MnO2 film on glass substrate. As shown in Fig. 1a, H-Birnessite shows a different structure from the PANI-MnO2 film and is looked like nano-rods and randomly gathered into small blocks. The PANI-MnO2 film has a sheet and layered appearance. Its surface is tight and smooth, and the dimensions of the particles range from a hundred to several hundreds of nanometers. 3.2 XRD measurements X-ray diffraction patterns of H-Birnessite, HCTA-MnO2, and PANI-MnO2 film are given in Fig. 2 . The d 001 value (0.73nm) of H-Birnessite corresponds to the interlayer spacing (Fig. 2a). Similar results were observed in the literature [13]. When the HCTA was added into the delaminated manganese oxide colloidal solution, it showed a new phase with a basal spacing of 2.94nm for the HCTA-MnO2 product (Fig. 2b). The XRD pattern consisting of a well-resolved 0 0 l basal series in the low 2θ range suggests that the manganese oxide layers are in an ordered manner. Since the distance between two adjacent carbon atoms can be expressed by 0.13nm/CH2 in the all-trans extended alkyl chains [28], the length of HCTA is estimated to be 2.49nm. The expansion of the interlayer (Fig. 2b) is much compatible with a layer of HCTA ions in which the head groups are organized head-to-tail, leading to an interdigitated arrangement of the hydrocarbon tails [29]. After the reaction between PANI and HCTA-MnO2 in NMP, the diffraction peaks of the HCTA-MnO2 product disappeared and a new basal spacing of 1.64nm is observed. After subtracting the thickness of the manganese oxide layer (0.45nm), the net interlayer expansion is about 1.19nm. This expansion is reasonable for the intercalation of a monolayer of PANI molecules, which suggests that the benzene rings of PANI are arranged in a zigzag conformation. A similar arrangement was observed for PANI intercalated in α-RuCl3 [30] and FeOCl [31]. 3.3 TG measurements The TG curves of H-Birnessite, PANI-MnO2 and PANI are given in Fig. 3 . According to the TG curve of H-Birnessite (Fig. 3a), a weight loss (10%) observed from 100°C to 260°C is due to the removal of physically absorbed and interlayer water. A further weight loss of 10% up to 700°C is attributed to the reduction of manganese from tetravalent to trivalent form accompanied by the evolution of oxygen. In the TG curve of PANI-MnO2 (Fig. 3b), a weight loss of 12% up to 170°C is due to the dissipation of the interlayer water. A further weight loss (46%) between 170°C and 600°C is attributed to the decomposition of PANI in the interlayer. The PANI content of PANI-MnO2 is 46%. Furthermore, the thermal stability of PANI in PANI-MnO2 has decreased compared with pure PANI (Fig. 3c), suggesting the activation of PANI decomposition by manganese oxide layers [15]. 3.4 Electrochemical characterization 3.4.1 Cyclic voltammetry measurements As shown in Fig. 4a, the oxidation current of PANI-MnO2 electrode under visible light irradiation is higher than that under dark, suggesting that visible light irradiation could increase the current of the PANI-MnO2 film. In other words, visible light irradiation could enhance the separation of electron-hole pair and accelerated interfacial charge transfer. So the PANI-MnO2 electrode can be used for photoelectrocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation. Fig. 4b illustrates the effect of sweep rates on the cyclic voltammograms. The oxidation peak between 1.2 and 1.5V (vs. SCE) is attributed to the oxidation of polyaniline from the reduced state to the corresponding radical cation, but the oxidation of the radical cation into quinone-polyaniline appears at an oxidation potential of 1.6–1.8V (vs. SCE). The insert shows that both the oxidation and reduction currents change linearly with the scanning speed. The correlation coefficients of oxidation and reduction current are 0.9810 and 0.9699, respectively. The peak current is direct proportional to the scanning speed, which implies that the electrode reaction of RhB in the PANI-MnO2 film electrode is controlled by the process of surface. 3.4.2 Photoelectrocatalytic degradation measurements Fig. 5 shows the concentration variation of RhB at various bias potentials: 0.0V (photocatalysis), −0.3V, −0.6V, 0.3V, 0.6V, 0.9V, 1.0V (all versus SCE) and DP (direct photolysis). The degradation rate of RhB reached the largest value at the highest bias potential of 0.9V. At this potential, about 50% of RhB was degraded within 70min under visible light irradiation. Pseudo-first-order kinetics was confirmed in the photocatalytic and PEC processes by the linear transform ln(RhB0 /RhB)=kt (k is the kinetic constant, t is the degradation time). As shown in Table 1 , the PEC process has a larger pseudo-first-order kinetics constant of RhB than the photocatalytic process. 4 Conclusions The PANI-MnO2 film electrode was prepared by the delamination/reassembling process. XRD and TG indicated that MnO2 sheets and PANI were uniformly deposited by the delamination/reassembling process. The redox current of PANI-MnO2 film was higher than that of both PANI and MnO2. Visible light irradiation could enhance the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pair of PANI-MnO2 electrode, and the degradation rate of RhB reached the largest value at the bias potential of 0.9V. The photoelectrocatalytic degradation of RhB was significantly accelerated on PANI-MnO2 film electrode.
