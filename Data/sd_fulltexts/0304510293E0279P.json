Part 8. Conversion of n-octane with mono and bifunctional Pt-A1203 catalysts at 100 psig Dennis E. Sparks, Ram Srinivasan and Burtron H. Davis* Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, 3572 Iron Works Pike, Lexington, KY 40511, USA (Received July 20, 1993; accepted November 5, 1993) Abstract Pt monofunctional and bifunctional catalysts produce a common set of products apart from the C8aromatic and i-C8-alkane distributions at low conversions. The difference between the two types of catalysts therefore is essentially that of the rate and selectivity of producing aromatics vs. C,-C7 products. Overall, the bifunctional pathway provides both the most rapid and the most selective pathway for the formation of aromatics from n-alkanes. The bifunctional pathway provides a nearly equilibrium distribution of methyl heptanes whereas the monofunctional platinum pathway produces predominantly the isomers allowed from hydrogenolysis of alkylcyclopentanes formed by the fivecarbon ring cyclization of the n-alkane. The non-acidic Pt catalyst produces aromatics by direct sixcarbon ring formation. The acidic catalyst produces essentially a mixture of Ca aromatics that is near the thermodynamic equilibrium mixture, presumably because of isomerization reactions that proceed by metal catalyzed cyclization and by acid catalyzed cyclization. Key words: alumina; dehydrocyclization; octane; paraffin; platinum 1. Introduction Alkane dehydrocyclization to produce aromatics was discovered in the late 1930s [ 1,2] and has been studied extensively since that time. It was thought that the need for high octane aviation fuel during World War II (WWII) would make dehydrocyclization a commercial success; however, other sources of high octane fuels eliminated the urgent need to develop a dehydrocyclization process. The military interest in this work in the US was reported to ` Corresponding author; fax. ( + 1-606)2570220. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 be responsible for a delay in the announcement of the discovery of the reaction by UOP workers [ 3 ] . Shortly following WWII, UOP reported a naphtha reforming process that employed a bifunctional catalyst utilizing Pt for the metal function and a chloride containing alumina for the acidic function [4] . In spite of the desire to convert alkanes to aromatics, the extent of study under conditions that approximate commercial reforming conditions is sparse. Mills et al. [ 5 ] defined the role of bifunctional catalysts in naphtha reforming. Hettinger et al. [6] conducted one of the first studies and defined rates for the conversion of n-heptane. Some authors, e.g., [ 7 ] , were of the view that the platinum function alone could catalyze aromatics formation by cyclization to a five carbon ring followed by ring expansion to a six carbon ring and subsequent dehydrogenation to aromatics. Others contended that direct six carbon ring formation was the only pathway by which Pt produces significant amounts of aromatics, e.g., [ 8,9 ] . While there has been discussion as to whether the conversion of alkanes to aromatics follows the classical bifunctional mechanism involving both metal and acid sites, more work needs to be directed toward answering this question. For example, Shum et al. [ 10] used a mechanical mixture of a non-acidic platinum catalyst and acidic alumina, and concluded that the metal function controls dehydrocyclization. Sivasanker and Padalkar [ 11 ] investigated the dehydrocyclization of C6 through C8 alkanes using Pt-alumina catalysts; however, these authors carried out their reactions at atmospheric pressure where catalyst aging was rapid. In spite of this, these authors concluded that the metal function was the critical parameter with n-hexane and n-heptane; however, both metal function and acid sites could be important for n-octane. Ako and Susu [ 12] also investigated the dehydrocyclization of n-octane with monofunctional and bifunctional Pt/A'203 catalysts; however, the total pressure was only 1.8 atm. Callender et al. [ 13] expressed the view that Pt catalyzed cyclization through CS ring closure and that ring expansion led to aromatics. They reported that alumina had activity for cyclization of the alkenes produced from dehydrogenation but that for dispersed Pt, the metal catalyzed cyclization was more rapid. Henningsen [ 14] reported that the predominant pathway for the conversion of n-heptane to toluene is with a bifunctional mechanism, and that the acid catalyzed pathway was more rapid. Dautzenberg and Platteeuw [ 15 ] followed the conversion of n-hexane with Pt on a nonacidic alumina catalyst. They concluded that dehydrocyclization of n-hexane to benzene proceeds along two different reaction paths: (a) Pt-catalyzed ring closure whose contribution to total rate of aromatization is proportional to total Pt surface regardless of metal particle size and (b) thermal six-fing closure of hexatrienes formed by dehydrogenation from n-hexanes over the Pt function. They argued for a monofunctional reaction pathway for Pt that involves both five and six-ring formation: n-hexane benzene 5-member ring species mono-branched hexanes In the late 1960s the introduction of bimetallic catalysts greatly extended the catalyst lifetime between regenerations; the platinum-rhenium combination was the initial com- D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (7994) 325-342 327 mercial success [ 16] . Platinum-tin was introduced about the same time but did not attain the success of the Pt-Re combination. However, as continuous regeneration reforming has become more important, the interest in the Pt-Sn combination has increased. An initial view of the role of the second metal was to form an alloy with platinum which retarded metal agglomeration, and the subsequent loss of metal function activity. Pt-Sn catalysts, both supported and unsupported, have been the subject of extensive characterization studies and the literature is much too extensive to review here. Pt-Sn catalysts, where the Sn/Pt ratio has varied over a wide range, have been subjected to characterization using a variety of instrumental techniques [ 17-26 ] . In brief, it was found that over a wide range of Sn/Pt compositions, only one dominant alloy with a composition Pt: Sn= I : I was formed. Furthermore, the amount of Pt present as alloy depended upon the molar ratio of Sn/Pt; the higher this ratio the greater was the extent of alloy formation. Activity data for Pt-Sn catalysts were not available for making reliable comparisons with the extensive characterization data. In order to compare Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts, it was necessary to develop data with Pt non-acidic and acidic catalysts under conditions that are relevant to commercial reforming conditions. These baseline studies with two Pt-acidic support and two Pt-non-acidic support catalysts are the subject of this paper and form a basis for comparison with Pt-Sn catalysts [ 27 ] . 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Supported Pt catalysts were prepared using two acidic and two non-acidic supports. These supports were: (1) COP, an alumina prepared by omitting tin from the recipe utilized by Meitzner et al. [ 28 ] for the preparation of an alumina coprecipitated with Sn (200 M2/g); (2) UCI, a commercial alumina provided by United Catalysts, Inc. (300 m2/g) ; (3) NAA, a non-acidic alumina prepared by precipitation from a potassium aluminate solution using CO, (200 m2/g) [17]; and (4) SIL, a high surface area silica obtained from Davison Chemical Co. (340 m2/g). Each support was impregnated with aqueous chloroplatinic acid utilizing the incipient wetness technique. Each catalyst contained 1.0 wt.% Pt except for the COP alumina which contained only 0.6 wt.% Pt. Following impregnation, each catalyst was dried in air at 120 C overnight. The catalyst was reduced in-situ in hydrogen at 500 C and 1 atm hydrogen pressure. The runs were conducted using a plug flow reactor made from a 17 in., one-half inch o.d. 304 SS tube, jacketed with a one inch diameter copper sheath. The catalyst was retained in the tube with glass wool plugs at the top and bottom, with any excess tube capacity filled with either glass beads or glass wool. Typical catalyst beds ranged from 2 to 5 in. in height. The reactor was placed vertically in a one inch tube furnace. n-Octane was introduced at the top of the vessel by a high pressure piston pump with a 1.9 to 19 ml/h pumping rate. Hydrogen was metered with a mass flow controller with a capacity of 0-400 sccm. The liquid product was collected in a 300 ml bomb at ambient temperature and 100 psig. The gaseous product exited via a back pressure regulator maintained at 100 psig. The catalyst was reduced in-situ overnight at 500 C, 100 psig and 35 sccm hydrogen 328 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalvsis 88 (/994) 325-342 prior to feeding n-octane. The runs were conducted at 482 C and 100 psig. n-Octane feed rate was varied from 0.466 to 8.158 mol/h per gram of Pt. The hydrogen flow rate was adjusted to provide a constant 8 :1 mole ratio of H2: n-octane. The amount of catalyst varied from 1.50 to 5.00 g. The liquid product was usually collected every hour for a period of several hours. Then a process condition would be changed and the run would continue at the new conditions for about 18 h before the next sampling period. Analysis of the liquid utilized a gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m DB5 column. Because the DB5 column could not adequately separate the benzene/ cyclohexane, 2-methyl heptane/toluene, and m-xylene/p-xylene peaks, the samples were also analyzed with a second GC, equipped with a Carbowax column to effect the analysis of the above mentioned pairs. Gas samples were collected in 40 ml bombs, usually just prior to changing feed rates. Analysis was performed on a Carle 311H gas analyzer. 3. Results The conversions of n-octane, based upon n-octane disappearance, are shown in Fig. 1 for the four Pt catalysts. The two acidic catalysts are significantly more active than the two nonacidic catalysts. Conversion, as used in Fig. 1, includes the conversion of n-octane to other C8-alkane isomers as well as to aromatics and C8-liquid products. Surprisingly, a common trend for the selectivity for producing iso-Cs-alkanes relative to aromatics appears to apply for both acidic and non-acidic supported Pt (Fig. 2). At first glance this could be attributed to residual acidity for the \"non-acidic\" catalysts; however, this is shown not to be the case because of the aromatic compositions to be described below. A direct cyclization of n-octane to form C8 aromatics would produce only ethylbenzene and o-xylene. If residual acidity was present to isomerize n-octane to iso-octanes by a dual functional mechanism, the aromatic products should contain a nearly equilibrium distribution of C8-aromatics.

Thus, the catalysts based upon acidic supports produce essentially an equilibrium aromatic distribution as expected, but MX and PX are very minor components in the C8-aromatic products obtained using the non-acidic supports. The data therefore suggest that there are two pathways for producing iso-alkanes: one is a bifunctional pathway and the second is a monofunctional pathway that is catalyzed by the metal function only.

The data in Fig. 3 show that the actual weight loss (based upon recovered liquid products) with n-octane conversion is greater than this. Furthermore, there are two trends in weight loss with conversion: one for the non-acidic catalysts and one for the acidic catalysts. The line for the weight loss with the non-acidic catalysts goes through the origin with a slope of 0.53, and indicates that slightly more than 50% of the noctane conversion is to gaseous products with these catalysts.

However, CS -hydrocarbons were not included in the analysis of the gas phase sample; hence a small, relatively insignificant fraction of the loss indicated in Fig. 3 is due to this as well as to losses in sampling, etc. The activity of the catalyst during the 0-60 h of the test periods is reasonably constant. The data in Fig. 4 for Pt on non-acidic alumina is representative of the activity maintenance with each catalyst. D. E.

With the non-acidic catalysts, only slightly more than 10% of the noctane conversion leads to aromatics; this is an upper estimate since it is based upon liquid products and does not include the gaseous products. Thus, the selectivity for aromatics for the conversion of n-octane with Pt supported on silica or non-acidic alumina is in the range of only 6 to 10%. With the acidic catalyst support there are two conversion regions. In the first region, corresponding to about the first 30% of n-octane conversion, the reaction is predominantly that of the conversion of n-octane to C8-iso-octanes. Thus, the n-octane isomerization to branched isomers is so rapid that an equilibrium distribution is approached closely before appreciable aromatics are formed. At n-octane conversions greater than about 30%, aromatics are formed more rapidly, for a given amount of conversion of n-octane, than was observed for the non-acidic catalysts. Aromatics therefore appear to be formed much more selectively with the acidic catalysts. Part of the reason for this is due to the x-axis in Fig. 5 showing only n-octane conversion while aromatics are formed by the conversion of both hand iso-octanes. Even so, it is evident that aromatics are formed more selectively when the acidic catalyst is used. Essentially the same aromatics selectivity is obtained for the two acidic catalysts. Based upon the slope of the lines defined by the data obtained from the non-acidic (Fig. 5, NA) and the acidic (Fig. 5, A) catalysts, the production of aromatics D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 337 per unit of n-octane conversion is 5 to 6 times greater with the acidic catalysts than with the non-acidic catalysts. A similar picture emerges if the comparison is based upon the aromatics production vs. total C8-alkane conversion (Fig. 6) . The data for the two sets of catalysts - acidic and nonacidic supports - fit straight lines rather well. For the Pt on non-acidic supports, the slope is 0.18 indicating that only 18% of the Cg-alkane conversion results in the formation of aromatics. For the acidic supported catalysts, 59% of the C8 alkane conversion results in the production of aromatics. Thus, the presence of the cyclization pathway provided by the acidity increases the selectivity for aromatics formation, and the data in Fig. 6 indicate that the acidic catalyst produces about 3.3 times as many aromatics per unit of Cg-alkane conversion as occur with the non-acidic catalyst. The aromatic distribution for the catalysts based on the acidic support is essentially the same over a range of flow rates (and hence conversion); this is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the catalyst based upon a precipitated alumina. Essentially the same result is obtained for the catalyst based on the UCI alumina support. Thus, apart from an initial break-in period, the aromatic distribution does not depend upon either the flow rates or the run times covered in this study (Figs. 7 and 8). The data in Fig. 8 for the C8-aromatic distribution would be expected to remain essentially constant since the n-octane conversion to other C8 isomers is much more rapid than the conversion to aromatics while there may be small changes in the C8-aromatic distribution with time, the aromatics produced from essentially equilibrated C8-alkane isomer mixtures are nearly constant with time. The data in Fig. 9 illustrates that the aromatic distribution obtained from n-octane with the Pt_Si02 non-acidic catalyst does not vary with conversion up to about 35% C$-alkane conversion. Furthermore, the aromatics are those expected for cyclization by direct formation of a C6 carbon ring. The products produced with the Pt catalyst using the COP-alumina (without tin) support are shown in Fig. 10. With increasing flow rate, the formation of aromatics as well as the CS C7 and the C,-CQ compound groupings decrease. However, the C8 isomers, including the C8 cycloalkanes, increase with increasing space velocity. Similar data were obtained with the Pt on UCI alumina catalyst. Another difference between the acidic and non-acidic supported Pt catalysts is illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. 2- and 3-methylheptane should not be formed by the hydrogenolysis of either alkyl- or dialkyl-cyclopentane that can be formed by direct ring closure of n-octane: n-propylcyclopentane and 1-methyl-2-ethylcyclopentane. It is very difficult to separate 3methylheptane and 3-ethylhexane by our GC analysis; however, using cryogenic conditions during the initial part of the GC run permits an estimation that most of the peak area for the products shown in Fig. I1 corresponds to 3-ethylhexane. For the hydrogenolysis of npropylcyclopentane, the products should be n-octane, 3-ethylhexane and 4-methylheptane; if hydrogenolysis produces a statistical distribution, the amount of these products should be 40%, 20%, and 40%, respectively. Likewise, hydrogenolysis of 1-methyl-2-ethylcyclopentane would produce 20% each of n-octane, 3-ethylhexane, 2-methyl-3-ethylpentane, 3,4dimethylhexane and 4-methylpentane. The products in Fig. 11, since the peak corresponding to 3-methylheptane plus 3-ethylhexane is in fact mostly 3-ethylhexane, are therefore consistent with the methylheptanes being formed primarily by hydrogenolysis of the alkyl 338 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 substituted cyclopentanes that are formed directly from n-octane for the catalyst based on the non-acidic support. For the acidic supported Pt catalyst, a different iso-octane distribution is obtained (Fig. 12). The distribution in this case includes 3-methylheptane as well as 3-ethylhexane. Furthermore, the amount of 2-methylheptane is as great as that of 3-methylheptane. Thus, with the acidic catalyst much of the iso-octanes are produced through a bifunctional pathway. The data in Figs. 5, 11 and 12 indicate that the rate corresponding to a bifunctional isomerization pathway is much more rapid than the isomerization catalyzed by the metal only. The amounts of alkylcyclopentanes obtained in these runs increase with an increase in n-octane conversion with Pt on both non-acidic support catalysts (Fig. 13). Thus, CS ring formation is more rapid than the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the alkylcyclopentanes. On the other hand, the amount of alkylcyclopentane remains nearly constant during conversion using the acidic catalyst over essentially the total n-octane conversion range (Fig. 14). This implies that the rate of formation of the alkylcyclopentanes by the acid cyclization is balanced by the subsequent isomerization to an alkylcyclohexane, followed by the rapid dehydrogenation to alkylaromatics by the Pt function. 4. Discussion The conversion of n-octane to aromatics needs to be considered for two sets of catalysts: those based on the non-acidic support (silica and non-acidic alumina) and the acidic support (UCI and the COP-alumina). The aromatics produced using the Pt on non-acidic supports are comprised of 90% or greater of the aromatics expected for direct six carbon ring formation: ethylbenzene and o-xylene. The ratio of EB : OX for the Pt-non-acidic alumina is very close to 1: 1 as was reported earlier [ 29] . However, the EB : OX ratio for Pt supported on silica is 1.4: 1 and this approaches more closely to the 2: 1 ratio expected for a direct six-carbon ring closure based on the statistical ways in which the six-carbon ring can be formed. The aromatic distributions clearly indicate that the Pt on silica or non-acidic alumina catalysts do not have acidity. Even so, iso-octane isomers are formed more rapidly than aromatics are produced for both of these non-acidic catalysts. Thus, even for these nonacidic supports, an isomerization pathway must operate. As shown in Fig. 5, C$-iso-alkanes are produced about six times faster than aromatics at the 10% n-octane conversion level; at lower n-octane conversion levels the slope of the line in Fig. 5 suggests that this ratio of iC8/aromatics approaches 8 or higher. For this reason, the rates in Fig. 2 should be viewed as the rate of Pt catalyzed conversion of n-octane, and the selectivity for producing an aromatic product is only about 10% of the total n-octane conversion. Thus, the Pt function catalyzes four types of reactions: (1) aromatization by direct six carbon ring formation, (2) isomerization by cyclization to a five carbon ring structure followed by hydrogenolysis of the alkyl = cyclopentane intermediate, (3) conversion of n-octane to C, through C7 hydrocarbons by hydrogenolysis, and (4) the dehydrogenation of alkanes and naphthenes. Thus, for the Pt catalytic function the following reaction network applies: D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 339 [alkylcyclohexanes] ~ CB-aromatics Cn-C, :;~ n-C,,=) n-plus i-CB 1L alkylcyclopentanes In the above scheme, an alkylcyclohexane structure is shown although there is no data in this paper to eliminate the structure being the one obtained from cyclization of an octatriene. However, the cyclization to the alkylcyclopentane could not occur through such a triene mechanism. The formation of more iso-octanes than aromatics with the single functional Pt catalyst shows that the pathway to produce aromatics by ring expansion of the cyclopentane ring to a cyclohexane structure does not occur at a significant rate. This conclusion is in conflict with some early claims, e.g., ref. [ 7 ] ; however, the conclusion agrees with studies with '4C labeled cyclopentane [ 30,31 ] . In a recent review [32] it is stated that: \"It has been shown that the isomerization and hydrocracking reactions require the catalyst to have two separate and distinct functions - a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function and an acidity function.\" This requirement is clearly not necessary; isomerization of the n-alkane can, and does, occur over the metal function through CS-ring formation and subsequent hydrogenolysis, and this occurs at a rate that is faster than the formation of aromatics. Likewise, hydrocracking occurs to a greater extent with a non-acidic supported catalyst than with the acid supported catalyst. As naphtha reforming is practiced, halides and water levels are controlled to provide acidity in excess of that of the base Pt-alumina catalyst. Thus, in the present case we may view the data obtained with the Pt on acidic alumina as a base case. The acidity of the support for the present study arises from that associated only with the support and any acidity that results from the chloride added during impregnation with chloroplatinic acid. Additional acidity through chloriding, etc. will only magnify the present results which show that aromatization by a bifunctional route is the dominant route for the production of aromatics. n-Octane conversion with Pt-acidic catalysts differs from that of Pt-non-acidic catalysts because there is an equilibrium, or near equilibrium, of the octanes; that is, of n-octane and many of the other C8-alkane isomers prior to the formation of appreciable aromatics. Thus, for the acidic catalyst, aromatization results from the conversion of this interconverting mixture of C8-alkane isomers, and not just from n-alkane. Another feature of the Pt-acidic catalyst is that it produces aromatics at nearly ten times the rate of the Pt-non-acidic catalyst. At the same time, the selectivity for aromatics production from n-octane for the Pt-acidic catalyst is about five times greater than for the Ptnon-acidic catalyst. With the acidic catalyst, the bifunctional pathway produces aromatics more rapidly and more selectively than by the Pt function only pathway. Thus, for the Pt on an acidic support the bifunctional pathway dominates in producing aromatic products over that of the monofunctional Pt pathway. The monofunctional pathway can be represented as: 340 D.E. Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 C3 C2 C -ring C c~ os ure a 6 & C6-ring n-CO closure C -ring closure CB-aromatics C 1 C7 The bifunctional pathway for the production of aromatics may be represented as: Pt C3 Cz nCB', i-C8' A - C~ I~JA n- C, Cz 6 C I P 118 - I_CB IPt Cz C 6 a Pt Pt, platinum; A =support acidity; B represents the series conversion involving the three steps Pt, A, Pt. In principle, C,-C, products can be formed from any of the products shown in the above scheme. The current data do not permit us to define those compounds that produce the C,C-, products; hence, we have not included pathways for C,-C7 formation in the above scheme. In general, Pt monofunctional and bifunctional catalysts produce a common set of products apart from the C8 aromatic and i-CB-alkane distributions at low conversions. The difference between the two types of catalysts therefore is essentially that of the rate and selectivity of producing aromatics vs. C,-C7 products. Overall, the bifunctional pathway provides both the most rapid and the most selective pathway for the formation of aromatics from n-alkanes. This conclusion differs from a kinetic treatment for n-hexane [ 33 ] . D.E Sparks et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 88 (1994) 325-342 341 5. References [ 1 ] B.A. Kazanskii and A.F.

Pt monofunctional and bifunctional catalysts produce a common set of products apart from the C8-aromatic and i-C8-alkane distributions at low conversions. The difference between the two types of catalysts therefore is essentially that of the rate and selectivity of producing aromatics vs. C1C7 products. Overall, the bifunctional pathway provides both the most rapid and the most selective pathway for the formation of aromatics from n-alkanes. The bifunctional pathway provides a nearly equilibrium distribution of methyl heptanes whereas the monofunctional platinum pathway produces predominantly the isomers allowed from hydrogenolysis of alkylcyclopentanes formed by the five-carbon ring cyclization of the n-alkane. The non-acidic Pt catalyst produces aromatics by direct six-carbon ring formation. The acidic catalyst produces essentially a mixture of C8-aromatics that is near the thermodynamic equilibrium mixture, presumably because of isomerization reactions that proceed by metal catalyzed cyclization and by acid catalysed cyclization.
