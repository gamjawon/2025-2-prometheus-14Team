Viljoen and J.A.K. du Plessis* Department of Chemistry, Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, Potchefstroom 2520 (South Africa) (Received June 3, 1992; accepted September 14, 1992 ) Abstract The reaction between hex- l-yne and acetonitrile with CpCoCOD as catalyst produces pyridine derivatives. Several factors influence the reaction, such as temperature, irradiation, oxygen and solvents. If the system is thermally activated it is necessary to keep it at 413 K to maintain the cocyclotrimerization reaction. If the system is photochemically activated the reaction can proceed at room temperature. The molar ratio of the pyridine compounds compared to the benzene compounds formed increases fourfold if the thermal activation is replaced by the photochemical process. Key words: alkyne; cobalt complexes; cyclotrimerization; photochemical activation; pyridine derivatives Introduction Cobalt compounds such as COC12 6H20 [ 1,2 ] , CPCo (CO) 2 [ 3 ] , Cp2Cp [4],CpCoCOD [5,6],CpCo(PPh3)2 [4,7,8],andcobaltvapour [6] can be used to catalyze the cocyclotrimerization reaction of alkynes and nitriles. All systems containing the central unit of Cp-CoI (Cp=cyclopentadienyl) are effective catalysts for the synthesis of pyridine derivatives [ 2 ] . The complex ligands must be completely or partially displaced from the metal by the alkyne/nitrile so that an active cobalt (I) species can be formed [2]. Some reactions that are catalyzed by cobalt systems are: 1. Alkynes and nitriles [2,4,5,9,10]: R' 2R'C - CH + R2CN --- Ri 0~ R2 N W= H, CH3, C4H9, C6H5 ete.

The cocyclotrimerization reaction can also be carried out at ambient temperatures by irradiating the reaction mixture. The wavelength of the light must be > 360 nm, because the catalyst decomposes at lower wavelengths [9 ] . The most important catalysts for the pyridine synthesis are of the type [YCoL] [2,11,12] (Y=Cp, Me5C5 etc., L=diolefin etc.). Properties of the fYCoLJ-type catalyst Electron-poor metal centres, as in (CSH,COMe)CoCOD or (C,,H,C02 Me) CoCOT, show the highest activity but the lowest regioselectivity. Electron-rich metal centres in (C5Me5) CoCOD are more selective but a great reduction in reactivity is observed [ 13 ] . The product selectivity is independent of the catalyst type [ 2 ] . Strong coordinating solvents, such as cyclic ethers, chlorocarbohydrates, amines or alcohols, decrease the reaction rate, but they have no influence on the product distribution or the pyridine/benzene ratio [ 2 ] . The reaction temperature plays a key role in the chemical selectivity and on the pyridine isomer distribution. The chemical selectivity is high and increases with increasing temperature in the cocyclotrimerization of pent-1-yne and hex- 1-yne with CH3CN and cobalt vapour as catalyst [6]. The regioselectivity is independent of temperature and the symmetrical substituted derivative is the main product [ 6 ] . Cobalt vapour as catalyst gave high turnovers with a pronounced chemical selectivity and regioselectivity. CpCoCOD under the same conditions gave a higher activity and high chemical selectivity but almost no regioselectivity [ 6 ] . J.S. Viljoen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 75-84 77 The product selectivity can be controlled by complexing other ligands to the cobalt [ 2 ] . The role of L The nature of the stabilising ligand, L, determines the ease with which it is replaced by the alkyne/nitrile [ 11 ] to give the propagating catalytic species [ 12 ] . L functions as a place holder which stabilises the catalytic central [YCo ] unit as a complex which can be isolated [ 11 ] . After initializing, the catalyst is only dependent on the Y ligand complexed to the cobalt [ 11,12 ] . The role of Y The activity of the Y-Co catalyst depends to a great degree on the nature of the ligand Y [ 12 ] . The activity and selectivity of the Y-Co catalyst can be improved by varying Y [ 11,12 ] . In the thermally activated process, electron-withdrawing groups in the Y ligand promote the dissociation of the L group [ 11 ] . This influence of the Y ligand is not noticeable when irradiation is used [ 9 ] . The ligand Y has a definite influence on the chemical selectivity of the catalyst [ 12 ] . Catalysts with a 14-electron core, e.g. the rl5-cyclopentadienyl Col system, promote pyridine formation, and a 12-electron core catalyst, e.g. the q-allyl Col system, favours the formation of a carbocyclic compound [10,12]. Kinetic studies have shown that the rate of the catalytic formation of pyridine is independent of the nitrile concentration [ 13 ] and depends on the square of the concentration of the alkyne in solution; the reaction rate for benzene compound formation also shows a quadratic dependence on the alkyne concentration [ 2 ] . A common cobalt cyclopentadiene intermediate is thus responsible for the formation of both pyridine and benzene [2,5,10]. In this paper we focus on such factors as temperature, irradiation, solvents and free oxygen, which influence the catalytic cocyclotrimerization of hex-1yne and acetonitrile, using CpCoCOD as catalyst. Experimental The CpCoCOD catalyst is prepared using procedures described in the literature [ 10,12 ] . All procedures were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. A solution of 7.77 X 10-3 mol/dm3 CpCoCOD in dry CH3CN and n-octane (as internal standard), was prepared and 1 cm3 of this catalyst solution was placed with the hex- 1-yne (hex- l-yne/Co mole ratio=236.8) in a reactor tube (a glass tube of 300 mm length and 3 mm i.d.). The tube was then sealed before heating or irradiating using the sun, a quartz halogen lamp (250 W), a high 78 J.S. Viljoen et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 75-84 pressure, water-cooled mercury lamp (Quarzlampen Gesellschaft, Hanau, type Q700, 750 W), or a UV lamp (Mineralight, 25 W) for a preset time. The experiments with free oxygen were carried out by the same procedures, but before sealing the tubes a specific amount of oxygen was bubbled into the reaction mixture. The influence of different solvents on the reaction was determined by adding 0.5 cm' of the solvent to 0.1 cm3 hex- 1-yne and 0.5 cm' catalyst solution in a tube which was then sealed. The total volume of the catalyst-acetonitrile solution and solvent added was thus kept at 1 cm3. The reactions were terminated by adding 5.6 X 10-3 mole H20 to the system. The product mixture was analysed with a Carlo Erba 4100 gas chromatograph with a capillary column (FS-SE-30, CB-0.25, 25 m X 0.32 mm). The products were identified by GC-MS measurements or by comparison with the authentic compounds. Results and discussion The reaction between hex-1-yne and acetonitrile with CpCoCOD catalyst produces pyridine derivatives according to the reaction: H9C4 C4 H9 HC=CC4H9 + CH3CN -Cot' - + isomers N CH 3 This reaction can be influenced by several factors, such as temperature, irradiation, oxygen and solvents. Relatively high temperatures are needed to activate this system. Figs. 1 and 2 show that a temperature of 413 K is necessary to obtain a yield of 95% of the pyridine compound. Bunnemann [ 11 ] indicated that the activity of the CpCoL type of catalyst above 393 K is independent of L. Thus, at 413 K the neutral ligand, L, has been displaced so that the pyridine formation depends on the catalytic activity of the CpCo unit. It is necessary to keep the system at 413 K to maintain the cocyclotrimerization reaction. If one assumes that the cocyclotrimerization reaction occurs via a first order process it follows from the integral method that the rate constant (k) can be calculated by using the following equation: In{(P.Y.).-(P.Y.)t}=-kt+lnf (P.Y.).-(P.Y.)o} where P.Y.=product yield. The reaction rates obtained are shown in Table 1. An Arrhenius plot can be constructed from these reaction rates and the activation energy, E, can be calculated. The activation energy was calculated as E=50.99 kJ mole-1. If the CpCoCOD system is photochemically activated, the cocyclotrimer- J.S. Viljoen et al./J. Mol.

Sunlight proved to be an effective source of irradiation for promoting the catalytic reaction (Fig. 3 ). Irradiation with a quartz-halogen lamp (250 W) is not so effective, and direct irradiation with a 125 W mercury lamp decomposes the system, leading to the formation of a brown precipitate. The wavelength of the light must be above 360 nm to prevent the decomposition of the catalyst. This was confirmed by using a light source of 366 nm to activate the system. A water-cooled, high pressure mercury lamp (750 W) also proved to be effective. too so eo 70 60 - o - 50 O 40 O 30 20 10 0 0 I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Time / Hours Fig. 3.

Catal. 79 (1993) 75-84 81 The environment of the light source filters out wavelengths lower than 360 nm and the catalyst does not decompose. The irradiation is not only necessary for the initial activation of the system, it must also assist the continuation of the cocyclotrimerization reaction. No products formed as soon as the light source was removed. Another big difference between the thermally and photochemically activated systems is that in the thermic process the activity depends on the temperature of the reaction mixture (Fig. 1). Schulz [9 ] reported that the activity for the irradiated CpCoL/HC-CH/CZHSCN system was independent of the temperature in the 213-323 K range. We found, however, that in the temperature range of 278-343 K for hex-1-yne and acetonitrile the product yield increased, as can be seen in Fig. 4. At 298 K a yield of 44.59% was obtained after 45 min irradiation, while at 325 K a yield of 95.99% was obtained.

In the thermic proces the molar ratio of pyridine and benzene compounds is in the order of 27 :1 while in the photoassisted process the ratio is 97 :1 in the sun and 87 :1 if the 250 W quartz halogen lamp was used. Table 3 presents the influence of different solvents on the yield of the pyridine compound. In these experiments the total volume of the catalyst and solvents were kept at 1 cm3, with the acetonitrile and solvent used being kept at a 1:1 volume ratio. Acetonitrile gave the best results. All other solvents used, polar and nonpolar, gave a lower yield of the pyridine compound. No big dif- 1Oo 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 ME-OH ET-OH PRO-OH BU-OH PEN-OH Alcohol Fig. 5.

High yields were obtained with irradiation in the presence of alcohols while the yield for the thermally activated systems were lower, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The difference between the yield of the photochemical and thermal activation is about 50% for methanol, while the differences for the other alcohols are smaller but still greater than the difference for the other solvents. Free oxygen, 02, influences the reaction, as indicated in Fig. 6. It is evident that free oxygen has a negative influence on this reaction. The product yield decreases from 97% to 30% if OZ is added to the system at a mole ratio of 02/ mole Co = 2.6. Conclusions The following system can be thermally activated to produce pyridine compounds: R CH3CN + RC-~H Cat. R Nel: .CH3 where Cat. = CpCoCOD This CpCoCOD system can also be photochemically activated by sunlight or a high pressure mercury lamp: a condition is that wavelengths > 360 nm must be used. Photochemical activation increases the chemical selectivity for the formation of the pyridine compound fourfold with respect to the thermally activated process. The rate of product formation can be increased by increasing the reaction temperature for the photochemical activated system. If additional solvents are added to the system, the product yield decreases for both systems. With methanol, however, the irradiated system gave a yield of 79%, while for the thermally activated system the yield was only 29%. Oxygen added to the system also deactivates the catalytic activity.
