Low ee values have been obtained for a terminal olefin like 4-chlorostyrene (10% with 2- and 3-Mn-(S,S) and 34% with 1-Mn-(S,S), Jacobsen's catalyst). Key words: chiral epoxidation catalysts; epoxidation; halogenated Schiff base complexes; manganese; Schiff bases; Introduction Efficient enantioselective formation of carbon-oxygen bond catalyzed by transition-metal complexes has been achieved by Sharpless et al. in the case of allylic alcohol epoxidation [ 1 ] and olefin dihydroxylation [ 2 ] . The development of catalysts for the enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins is still a challenging topic. Chiral metalloporphyrin catalysts gave only moderate enantiomeric excesses and the synthesis of optically active porphyrin ligands is always a low-yield multi-step procedure [ 3 ] . Chiral manganese (III) -salen complexes have been recently used by Jacobsen et al. to catalyze the enantioselective epoxidation of cis-disubstituted olefins with rather good chemical yields and high enantiomeric excesses (8998%) [4 ] . These easy-to-prepare catalysts have been associated with a cheap oxidant like NaOCI, however these manganese-salen complexes are easily bleached by sodium hypochlorite [ 5 ] . Introduction of two bulky tert-butyl groups in ortho and para positions of two salicylidene moieties of the ligand improved the catalyst enantioselectivity by inducing a face selective approach due to the steric hindrance of these bulky substituents (see complex 1-Mn(S,S) in Fig. 1). *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Structures of chiral manganese (III) Schiff base complexes: 1-Mn, X=t-Bu; 2-Mn, X=Cl; 3-Mn, X=Br. 1-, 2-, or 3-H2 stands for the free ligands. We tried to improve the stability and the activity of this catalytic system by (i) using ligands bearing electron-withdrawing groups, like chlorine or bromine, (ii) checking the behavior of potassium monopersulfate as oxygen atom donor and (iii) adding a 4-alkylpyridine as axial ligand. The activity of oxygenation metalloporphyrin-catalysts has been improved by bulky and/or electron-withdrawing groups [ 6 ] . We decided to apply this strategy to prepare sterically protected salen manganese complexes with electronegative substituents. Here we report the synthesis of chloro-N,N'-bis(2',4'-dichlorosalicylidene)-trans-1,2-cyclohexanediiminatoma nganese(III) (the racemic complex 2-Mn- ( ) and the optically active form 2-Mn- (S,S) prepared from the trans- (1S,2S)-cyclohexanediamine) and thecorrespondingdibromosalicylaldehyde derivatives 3-Mn-( ) and 3-Mn-(S,S). Effects of chlorine and bromine substituents have been investigated using racemic catalysts in the epoxidation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene and in the enantioselective epoxidation of 4chlorostyrene with the chiral S,S catalysts. Experimental Ligands and complexes syntheses 3,5-Di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde was synthesized starting from 2,4-di-tertbutylphenol and paraformaldehyde in presence of 2,6-lutidine [ 4 (a) ,7 ] . Other starting materials, 3,5-dichloro- and 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde, (+) trans(1S,2S)-diaminocyclohexane and ( )trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane were obtained from Aldrich. In a typical Schiff base complex synthesis, 1 equivalent of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (either the racemic mixture or the pure enantiomer) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (0.1 M solution), 2 equiv. of substituted salicylaldehyde were added and the reaction mixture was maintained at reflux for about 1 h. Condensation was monitored by TLC (Si02 plate, hexane/diethylether 70/30 as eluent) until complete disappearance of the starting aldehyde. Free ligands were obtained by precipitation with water (10 X ethanol volume), recovered by filtration and dried under vacuum at 40-50 C. Metallation could be performed in situ, without ligand isolation, by addition of 2 equiv. of Mn (OAc) 2 - 4H20 and one hour of reflux. Then, the axial chloride ligand was A. Robert et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993)13-19 15 introduced by addition of 3 equiv. of LiCl (0.5 h of additional reflux). After cooling the reaction mixture, manganese (III) -salen complexes 1- to 3-Mn were precipitated by addition of water as described for free ligands. Overall yields for the synthesis of manganese complexes were ranging from 70 to 85% . Free ligands 1- to 3-H2- (S,S) were characterized by 1H NMR, IR and elementary analyses. The corresponding manganese (III) complexes were characterized by IR and elementary analyses. Specific rotations were measured for chiral ligands and complexes.

Catal. 85 (1993)13-19 17 Results and discussion Catalytic activities of racemic manganese Schiff base complexes 1-, 2- or 3 Mn-( ) The catalytic efficiency of the racemic Mn (III) complexes as epoxidation catalysts was studied using 1,3-cyclooctadiene as substrate and sodium hypochlorite or potassium monopersulfate as oxygen atom donor in a biphasic medium (dichloromethane/water or buffer). The results are summarized in Table 1. With 1-Mn-( ) and NaOCI, the olefin was completely converted within 2 h in the presence of 4-methylpyridine and the monoepoxide yield was 80%, corresponding to a catalytic activity of 20 cycles/h (olefin conversion and epoxide yield were 95 and 70%, respectively, within 30 min with KHS05 as oxidant, catalytic activity being 76 cycles/h in this case). But only 47% of 1,3-cyclooctadiene are converted in 2 h without 4-methylpyridine. A proximal effect is probably responsible for this enhanced activity as observed in metalloporphyrin-catalyzed epoxidations [ 5 ] . In addition, 4-methylpyridine is necessary to solubilize the halogenated Schiff base complexes 2- and 3-Mn- ( ), these halogenated catalysts being less soluble in dichloromethane than 1-Mn( ). But, more surprisingly, a low olefin conversion was observed with these two halogenated complexes. Only 14% of olefin conversion are obtained with 3-Mn-( ) and NaOCI (47% with KHSOb) and 30% with 2-Mn-( ) and Na0C1 (41% with KHS05). Complete conversion was never observed with these halogenated catalysts whereas nearly complete conversion (98%) was obtained with 1-Mn- ( ), suggesting that they are less robust than the parent complex with t-butyl groups (this situation is opposite to that observed with halogenated metalloporphyrin catalysts) [ 6 ] . In fact, all these Schiff base catalysts are bleached at the end of the reaction. This might be due to the intermolecular destruction of the chiral ligand by the catalytically active high-valent manganese-oxo species. The t-butyl substituted catalyst 1-Mn- ( ) has the best catalytic activity in terms of initial rate, and therefore allows, in the most suitable conditions, the complete conversion of the olefin. Enantioselective epoxidation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene and 4-chlorostyrene catalyzed by 1-, 2- or 3-Mn-(SS) complexes Enantioselective epoxidation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene and 4-chlorostyrene has been investigated with 1-, 2- or 3-Mn-(S,S) as catalysts and various oxygen atom donors, sodium hypochlorite, potassium monopersulfate and hydrogen peroxide. Results are summarized in Table 2. For these two olefins rather moderate enantiomeric excesses have been obtained compared to ee's previously reported for cis-disubatituted olefins [ 4 ] . We observed only an ee of 21% with 1,3-cyclooctadiene and 1-Mn-(S,S) as catalyst (in the same experimental conditions, an ee value of 45% was previously reported [4 (c) ] ). With the same catalyst the highest ee values for 4chlorostyrene was obtained with H202, 39% compared to 34% with KHS05 18 A. Robert et at. / J. MU CataL 85 (1993)13-19 (hydrogen peroxide has also been recently used in the asymmetric oxidation of sulfides by chiral Schiff base complexes, [4d] ). Lower ee values have been obtained with halogenated chiral manganese complexes 2- and 3-Mn-(S,S): only 10% ee for both catalysts, suggesting that bromine and chlorine substituents do not provide a sufficient steric hindrance to induce a face selective approach of the substrate. In addition, Jacobsen et al. [9 ] have shown that an electron-withdrawing group in the 4,4' positions of chiral Schiff base complexes are able to lower the enantioselectivities, whereas two methoxy groups enhanced the ee's values. So, the present study with two electron-withdrawing groups per phenyl units instead of one confirms that the successful electronic tuning in metalloporphyrin chemistry is not applicable to Schiff base complexes. Conclusion The use of manganese Schiff base catalysts bearing two bromine or chlorine atoms in ortho and para positions of the two salicylidene moieties did not allowed us to improve the so-called Jacobsen's catalyst 1-Mn. First of all, these halogenated complexes 2-Mn and 3-Mn are less soluble in dichloromethane than 1=Mn itself. It was then necessary to add 10% volume of 4-methyl- or 4t-butylpyridine versus CHZCl2 in the catalytic mixtures in order to solubilize the catalyst. The reactivity of the chlorinated and brominated catalysts was lower than those of the t-butyl substituted one by a factor of 2 for the epoxidation of 1,3cyclooctadiene with KHS05 as oxygen atom donor. Moreover, the 10% ee obtained for the epoxidation of 4-chlorostyrene by the 2- or 3-Mn- (S,S) /KHS05 systems (compared to 34% with 1-Mn-(S,S) ) evidence that the presence of more bulky subatituents like t-butyl groups on the salicylidene units is absolutely required to favor the substrate approach from the north face of the catalyst as previously indicated by Jacobsen [4 (a) ]. However the low ee values obtained with a terminal olefin like 4-chlorostyrene indicate that the enantioselective epoxidation of non-activated olefins is still a challenging area.
