Keywords: Ruthenium; Hydrogation; Aromatic substra es; Selectivity; C?rbonyl group 1. Introduction Ruthenium is well known as a suitable cata- lyst for selective hydrogation of an aromatic ring to cyclohexene and its derivatives [1-24]. It has also been successfully used for selective hydrogation of a carbonyl group in the vicin- ity of conjugated or isolated double bonds or an aromatic ring [5,24-33]. Aromatic or unsatu- rated alcohols prepared in this way are com- pounds of great commercial importance. Ac- cording to literature data acetophenone [5,34], citral [35-37], cinnamaldehyde [35-38], croton- aldehyde [32], etc., have already been used for such research. For our study we chose a group of aromatics substituted with hydroxy, methoxy or carbonyl functions. The group included phenol, anisole ^methoxybenzene), benzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy- berrzaldehyde, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). In this paper we report on the role of the type of substituent on the reactivity of the aromatic ring or the carbonyl group. 2. Expimental Corresponding author. 2.1. Chemicals Phenol, p.a.

Catalyst 5% Ru/act. charcoal type Ru-97 (Batch No. 318097003) catalyst supplied by Johnson Matthey was used in all experiments. The total surface area of the catalyst was 1 033 rt^/g, (BET) and the specific surface of ruthenium attained 130 mVg^ (titration method [39]). The catalyst (both the metal and the support) was X-ray amorphous with elemental crystal- lites of ruthenium less then 1 nm. The diffrac- tograms revealed not very diffused bands typi- cal for cr-SiO^ (quartz) crystallographic phase [40]. Quantitative analysis showed that the amount of quartz was in a range 1.5-1.7 wt%. Also considerable amount of sodium ions (0.20 wt%) was detected in the catalyst (AAS). 2.3. Experiments All the experiments were carried out in a semi-batch, isothermal, stirred reactor connected to gasometric burettes at 303 K and atmospheric pressure. Detail description of a system is given elsewhere [41,42]. Typically the catalyst (fine powder, 0.1-0.3 g) was activated at 403 K for 1.5 h m a stream of hydrogen (50 ml/min), then covered with a solvent (methanoi) and transferred to the reactor, where it was sub- jected to a final activation (303 K, 10 min, 50 ml/min, H 2). The reaction was started by injec- tion of a substrate to the reactor. 2.4. Analyses Samples of a reaction mixture were analyzed on a H&P 5890 Series II Plus gas Chromato- graph (Hewlett and Packard, USA) with FID detector using HP-20M capillary column (50 m/0.32 mm/0,32 ^m), r,-^ == 333-353 K, P(N;>) == 23 kPa, split ratio 1:35 and on a GC- MS analytical system JEOL DX 303 (JEOL, Japan) supplemented with a quartz capillary column SPB 5 (60 m). 3. Results and discussion Experimental data obtained in the hydroga- tion of selected substrates were described in terms of Langmuir-Hinshelwood differential rate equations based on the following assump- tions: there was only one type of surface active site, each molecule of reactant is adsorbed on a single active site, the surface reaction is the rate determining step and the total number of active sites is incorporated into a rate constant. The adsorption terms of the equations were further rearranged by using relative adsorption coeffi- cients. Kinetic and adsorption parameters were evaluated by the random walk method. Although all the reactions proceeded with total conversion of the initial compound, de- crease in catalytic activity was not observed, only in the hydrogation of anisole. Thus, when an initial substrate disappeared from the reaction mixture, the reactions slowed down significantly and stopped soon after. As con- firmed by addition of fresh substrates to a reac- tion mixture such behavior was caused by deac- tivation of the catalyst. In view of the above it is reasonable to define selectivity of a reaction to an intermediate in two different ways. The first definition, SQ = %B/(%A + %B + %C...), for a maximum concentration of an intermediate in a reaction mixture, is suggested for reactions when no deactivation occurs (in our experi- ments only in the hydrogation of anisole). The second definition of selectivity, SQ = %B/(%B 4- %C...} reflects composition of a re- action mixture when hydrogation stops owing to loss of activity of the catalyst. 3.1. Hydrogation of phenol and anisole In the hydrogation of phenol (A) primarily cyclohexanol (B) was formed which partly fur- ther converted into cyclohexene by dehydration. The consecutive reaction is very slow and the amount of cyclohexane (C) formed from cyclo- hexene by hydrogation did not usually exceed P. Kluson, L.

If cyclohexanone is assumed to be a keto- form of cyclohexenol (tautomeric isomers) the reaction might be assumed to be selective to a derivative of cyclohexene. The simplified reac- tion scheme (neglecting the marginal formation of cyclohexanone and cyclohexene) is given m Fig. 1. The reactivity of anisole was very high and no deactivation of the catalyst occurred. The main product of the reaction was memoxycyclo- hexane (Fig. 2), which was formed in a stepwise manner through an intermediary, methoxycyclo- hexene ( Sg = 0.20). Further transformation of methoxycyclohexane to cyclohexene by split- ting off methanoi was very slow and rather limited due to low activity of the catalyst for this reaction under the conditions studied. A typical course of the reaction is given in Fig. 3, where the maximum in the concentration of Fig. 3. A typical course of the transformations of anisole under the conditions for its hydrogation: ( anisole, (A) methoxycyclo- hexene, (A) melhoxycyclohexane, (+) cyclohexene, (0) cyclo- hexane. methoxycyclohcxene vs. time curve is clearly seen. Kinetic and adsorption parameters evaluated on a basis of experimental data coming from hydrogations of phenol and anisole are given in Table 1. Because catalyst deactivates in the hydrogation of phenol, comparison of the re- activities of both the substrates is somewhat questionable. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the reactivity of anisole was significantly higher than that of phenol. In both cases values of the relative adsorption coefficients show that the reactants with an aromatic ring or the deriva- tives of cyclohexene were more strongly ad- sorbed on the surface of ruthenium than corre- sponding derivatives of cyclohexane. 3.2.

Reaction scheme of the hydrogation of benzaldehyde. vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) proceeded with total conversion of the initial substrate. However, after disappearance of the substrate from the reaction mixture, the rate of hydrogation of the aromatic ring of the corre- sponding alcohol slowed down and depending on the type of molecule the reaction stopped. This was due to the considerable loss of activity of the catalyst. In the hydrogation of benzaldehyde primar- ily formation of benzyl alcohol was observed. In addition a small portion of this was further transformed to cyclohexylmethanol, which was formed in parallel from hexahydrobenzaldehyde -- a side intermediate of the reaction (Fig. 4). In experiments not described in this paper [30], it was shown that in the hydrogation of benzyl alcohol, the initial substrate, there was almost no decrease in activity of the catalyst. It seems reasonable that under the conditions studied, the activity of the ruthenium active sites was 'ex- hausted' in the hydrogation of a carbonyl group. Reactions of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4- methoxybenzaldehyde proceeded similarly (Fig, 5). While the reactivities of benzaldehyde and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde were comparable, the reactivity of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was much lower.

Although such an effect was already described by compar- ing reactions with phenol and anisole, its ab- sence in this case was most likely due to the activity lost of the catalyst. Besides the reaction pathways indicated in Fig. 5, dehydration of 4-hydroxycyclohexylmethanol and demethanolation of 4-methoxycyclohexyi- methanol also participated on the reaction scheme. However, the amount of products of these transformations did not exceed a limit of 3 mol% in a reaction mixture and their formation was not included to the rate model. The last substrate used - vanillin (4-hydroxy- 3-methoxybenzaldehyde) - contains two elec- tron-donor functional groups in positions 3, 4 and an electron-acceptor group in position 1. 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol was the principal product of its hydrogation. Low re- activity and no consecutive hydrogation of the aromatic ring were the typical features of the reaction under the conditions studied. Be- sides the principal product some other species were also formed, however, their total amount in a reaction mixture did not exceed 13 mo. To simplify the model it was considered these compounds to be expressed as one hypothetical side product of the reaction. The reaction scheme reflecting the above facts is given in Fig. 6.

Values of rate constants were previously used for discussion of the reactivities of the sub- strates. In this case 5g defines the selectivity because of the loss of the activity of the cata- lyst. In some cases (4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin) the relative adsorption coefficients of an initial compound were less than one. Regard- ing the types of the molecules it does not seem reasonable that the adsorptivities of the products and intermediates would be higher than those of the substrates. It is most likely that the loss of activity was also reflected in the values of the adsorption coefficients. 4. Conclusion A group of six aromatic substrates with hy- droxy, methoxy or carbonyl functions were hy- drogenated over ruthenium catalyst. In reactions with phenol and anisole a positive effect of the alkoxy group on hydrogation of an aromatic ring was shown. Formation of methoxycyclo- hexene was also observed. With aromatic car- bonyl compounds there was considerable loss of activity of the catalyst when the substrate disap- peared from the reaction mixture. The main products of the hydrogations of benzaldehyde and its derivatives were benzyl alcohol and its corresponding derivatives. A positive effect of the alkoxy group in position 4 to the carbonyl function on its reactivity was also observed.

In case of the aromatic aldehydes preferential hydrogenation of a carbonyl group was observed. When carbonyl group was not present, reactivity of the aromatic ring depended on the type of substituent.",
