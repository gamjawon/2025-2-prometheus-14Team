A series of MnFe catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis combined with heat treatment at different temperatures. The characterizations demonstrated that MnFe-120 with both surface -OH and -NO3, MnFe-175 with surface -OH, MnFe-300 containing neither surface -OH nor -NO3, and MnFe-300-NO3 containing surface -NO3 were gained by drying or calcination and impregnation. The activity evaluation showed that the order of catalytic activity was MnFe-120 > MnFe-175 > MnFe-300-NO3 > MnFe-300. Further, characterizations and experiment results revealed that O3 adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst can interact with surface -OH and generated hydroxyl radicals (·OH). The presence of surface -NO3 provided more Lewis acid sites, thereby promoting H2O adsorption and conversion to the surface -OH, which supplemented the surface -OH consumed by the interaction with O3. It was deduced that the coexistence of surface -OH and -NO3 improved the production of·OH, which synergistically promoted the catalytic ozonation of toluene.

VOCs are the major precursors of photochemical smog and haze, and also give rise to anemia, leukemia, respiratory diseases, etc. [3,4]. At present, the main purification technologies of VOCS are adsorption, thermal oxidation, and so on [5–11]. Absorption recovery technology has low operating costs and relatively simple process flows, but it is prone to problems such as difficult treatment of absorbents and secondary pollution. By thermal oxidation, VOCs can be converted to CO2 or less toxic products, however, thermal oxidation with a high reaction temperature consumes a large amount of energy. The catalytic ozonation of VOCs, as a new technology, has attracted more and more attention because of its mild reaction conditions and the significant decrease in O3 production cost. The researches show that catalytic ozonation of methanol, benzene, toluene, and other organic compounds happens at low temperatures (≦100 ℃) or even room temperature [12–18]. The transition metal oxides including MnOx FeOx, CeOx, CuO, NiO, TiO2, and ZrO2 are considered to be the most promising catalysts for practical applications [5]. However, the presence of water results in the deactivation of the catalysts although they exhibit superior catalytic performance under the dry atmosphere [19–21]. And it is generally attributed to the competitive adsorption between O3 and H2O over catalysts, and the reduction of reactive oxygen species [20–22] is a challenge for catalytic ozonation of VOCs. Oxyhydroxides, such as FeOOH, MnOOH, CoOOH, contain the abundant surface -OH, being a kind of important source of the strong reactive oxygen species for the catalytic ozonation of VOCs [23]. Great concerns have arisen about oxyhydroxides due to their superior active sites, excellent moisture resistance, and low cost [24]. It was reported that the surface -OH with a large number of electrophilic H and nucleophilic O can be used as active sites for·OH production [25–29]. Meanwhile, ozone has dipole properties, and is capable of adsorption on electrophilic H and nucleophilic O [26–29]. Ozone adsorbed on catalysts can react with the electrophilic H of surface -OH to generate·OH [30,31]. However, the formation of·OH is inhibited after the surface -OH consumption on catalysts. Therefore, the regeneration of surface -OH is decisive to a succession of the oxidation reaction. Lewis (L) acid sites are the dissociation center of adsorbed water. It is possible to regenerate surface -OH via dissociating water on L acid sites and thus producing electrophilic H (H+) [32]. Clearly, it is important to construct L acid sites in order to regenerate surface -OH. Previous studies have reported that the strong electronegativity of SO4 2- and S2O8 2- can induce electrons to shift, causing the metal atoms connected with them to present L acidity [33,34]. And the formation of L acid sites facilitates the adsorption and dissociation of H2O [35]. Compared with S2O8 2- (2.58 eV) and SO4 2- (1.93 eV), the electronegativity of NO3 - (4.58 eV) is stronger [36]. Theoretically, more L acid sites could be constructed with help of nitric acid groups. Given the above-mentioned understanding, it is expected to utilize surface -OH and -NO3 to synergistically promote the production of·OH and thus oxidize the VOCs. In this work, MnFe catalysts with different amounts of surface -OH and -NO3 were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis combined with heat treatment at different temperatures. And the role of surface -OH and surface -NO3 in the formation of·OH and catalytic ozonation of toluene was investigated by both physiochemical characteristics and activity evaluation. Meanwhile, the changes of surface groups in the presence or absence of water were analyzed by ATR-FTIR and in situ DRIFTS to reveal the interaction relationship between water and surface groups. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation A series of MnFe catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis at 160 °C, based on MnSO4·H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9 H2O with different matching. After the preliminary performance evaluation of catalytic ozonation of toluene, the MnFe catalyst with MnSO4·H2O/Fe(NO3)3·9 H2O molar ratio of 0.25, because of its best catalytic activity, was selected as the background catalyst to further investigate the role of different surface groups. Next, catalysts with different surface groups were obtained by heat treatment at different temperatures and dilute HNO3 impregnation of the background catalyst. The catalysts by drying at 120 °C or calcination at 175 °C and 300 °C were named as MnFe-120, MnFe-175 and MnFe-300, respectively. And MnFe-300 was impregnated in an HNO3 aqueous solution to obtain MnFe-300-NO3. All details about catalyst preparation were described in the supporting materials. 2.2 Characterization Information about Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectrometer (ATR-FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), Ion Chromatograph (IC) and Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), X-ray Powder Diffractometer (XRD), Pyridine Infrared (Py-FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Oxford Energy Spectrometer (EDS), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometer (ESR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), N2 Adsorption-Desorption Experiment (BET), In Situ Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (In Situ DRIFTS) are detailed in the supporting materials. 2.3 Performance evaluation The catalytic ozonation of toluene was tested in a continuous-flow quartz glass fixed-bed flow reactor at standard atmospheric pressure at 50 ℃. A mixture of 210 ppm O3, 30 ppm toluene, and equilibrium gas (20% O2 +N2) was fed with 0.3 g catalyst (40–60 mesh) at a flow rate of 1 L/min (GHSV, about 140,000 h−1), and the relative humidity (RH) was maintained at 50% unless described specifically. The concentrations of toluene and O3 were monitored online using gas chromatography (GC-2014) and an ozone detector (2B Technologies), respectively. Relevant details are available in the supporting materials. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts 3.1.1 Crystal structure of catalysts X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) were used to identify the crystal structures of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction peak positions of MnFe-120 and MnFe-175 corresponded well to the standard PDF card of α-FeOOH (PDF#99–0055), which indicated that the catalysts treated at 120 ℃ and 175 ℃ were α-FeOOH structure, and there were no discernable differences in crystallinity. The structures of MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3 were completely converted to α-Fe2O3 (PDF#99–0060), which was attributed to the dehydroxylation [37,38]. 3.1.2 Composition of catalysts The elemental composition of catalysts was determined by IC, AAS, and XPS analysis. As shown in Table 1, the content of SO4 2- did not change basically after heat treatment at different temperatures [39], and the Mn/Fe molar ratios were all close to 0.02/0.98. In addition, the NO3 - contents of MnFe-120 and MnFe-300-NO3 were almost the same while there were no NO3 - detected in MnFe-175 and MnFe-300, which suggested that NO3 - groups were removed above 175 ℃ [40,41]. 3.1.3 Surface groups of catalysts The catalyst surface groups were detected by ATR-FTIR, as shown in Fig. 1b. The obvious bending vibration peaks of δ(OH) (884 cm−1), γ(OH) (787 cm−1), Fe-OH (598 cm−1) [42,43], and the stretching vibration peak of -OH (3130 cm−1) were observed [44] over MnFe-120 and MnFe-175 catalysts. The surface -OH of MnFe-300 disappeared and a characteristic peak at 515 cm−1 appeared, which was attributed to the vibration of Fe-O bonds in α-Fe2O3 [45]. On the other hand, the bidentate chelate -NO3 vibration peaks could be observed at near 1300 cm−1 in the spectrum of MnFe-120 and MnFe-300-NO3 [46,47]. Combined with the IC results (Table 1), it was further confirmed that the surface -NO3 was successfully introduced on the catalyst surface by the dilute HNO3 impregnation treatment. Surface -OH and -NO3 were not detected on MnFe-300. In the O 1 s profiles of MnFe-120 and MnFe-175 (Fig. 1c), the binding energies at 530.1, 531.5, and 532.5 eV correspond to the lattice O of -O-Fe- (-Olattice), the low-coordinated adsorbed oxygen of oxygen vacancies (OVs), and the adsorbed oxygen of surface -OH (-OHads), respectively [32,48]. Compared with MnFe-120 and MnFe-175, the adsorbed O of surface -OH (-OHads) of MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3 disappeared, the lattice oxygen binding energies of -O-Fe- (-Olattice) were positively shifted and the content was significantly increased, which was associated with the dehydroxylation of MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3, following the results of Fig. 1b. 3.1.4 Lewis acid sites From the results of the inverse fold product of Fe2p in Fig. 2a, the characteristic peaks at near 711 eV and 725 eV were assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. And there were two satellite peaks of Fe (III) near 718 eV and 732.5 eV, which were consistent with the XPS spectra of α-FeOOH reported in the literature [49]. By observing the binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 characteristic peaks, it can be found that the Fe 2p binding energy gradually decreased with the increase of calcination temperature. In Fe 2p3/2, the order of binding energy magnitude of Fe (III) was MnFe-120 (713.5 eV) > MnFe-175 (713.3 eV) > MnFe-300-NO3 (713.1 eV) > MnFe-300 (713 eV), and the binding energy variation of Fe (II) followed the same trend, MnFe-120 (711.4 eV) > MnFe-175 (711.2 eV) > MnFe-300-NO3 (711.1 eV) > MnFe-300 (711 eV). By comparing MnFe-120 with MnFe-175, MnFe-300-NO3, and MnFe-300, it can be seen that surface -NO3 improves the binding energy of Fe, which is because the electronegativity of surface -NO3 (4.58 eV) is much larger than that of Fe (1.83 eV) [36]. The surface -NO3 will lead to the shift of the electron distribution around Fe, the decrease of the electron cloud density, and the increase of the binding energy. And the Fe atoms show electrophilicity and L acidity, thus constructing L acidity sites [29,50,51]. In combination with the ATR-FTIR spectra (Fig. 1b), compared with MnFe-175, MnFe-120 contains surface -NO3 and has a stronger ability to attract electrons around Fe, resulting in a decrease in the electron cloud density on the Fe 2p orbit and an increase in the binding energy, so that the Fe atom presents L acidity. As the same consequence, Fe 2p of MnFe-300-NO3 has a lower electron cloud density and higher binding energy to produce more L acidic sites compared to MnFe-300. Thus, the analysis revealed that surface -NO3 contributes to the formation of L acidic sites. The Lewis (L) acid sites and BrØnsted (B) acid sites contents on the catalyst surface were analyzed by adsorption of pyridine under vacuum at 150 ℃ (Fig. 2b). In Fig. 2b, the IR peak at 1540 cm−1 can be attributed to the desorption of pyridine adsorbed onto B acid sites [32], and the peaks at 1606 and 1448 cm−1 were attributed to the adsorption of pyridine on L acid sites, and the peak at 1487 cm−1 was the desorption of pyridine adsorbed onto both B acid sites and L acid sites [32]. Pyridine-FTIR and NH3-FTIR spectra (Fig. 2b and Fig. S7b) displayed that the B acid sites contents in MnFe-120 and MnFe-175 containing surface -OH were significantly higher than that in MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3 without surface -OH, revealing that surface -OH could facilitate the production of B acid sites [52]. The comparative results of L acid sites concentrations of MnFe-120 and MnFe-175, MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3 certified that the presence of surface -NO3 could create new L acid sites, which in turn boost the L acid sites concentration, consistent with the analysis of the XPS results (Fig. 2a). As shown in the H2O-FTIR infrared spectrum (Fig. 2c), the absorption peak at 1645 cm−1 belongs to the bending vibration absorption peak of H-O-H [53]. The variation trend of peaks intensity of adsorbed water was the same as the concentration of L acid sites, MnFe-120 >MnFe-175, MnFe-300-NO3 >MnFe-300, which illustrated that surface -NO3 can leave a raise in the L acid sites, and then contribute to the adsorption of H2O [54]. 3.2 Catalytic performance 3.2.1 Catalytic activity The activity of catalytic ozonation over MnFe-120, MnFe-175, MnFe-300, and MnFe-300-NO3 were compared under the same reaction conditions., As shown in Fig. 3a-d, the activities order was MnFe-120 > MnFe-175 > MnFe-300-NO3 > MnFe-300 (Fig. 3a-d). MnFe-120 exhibited excellent performance and the conversions of toluene and ozone were higher than 70% after the reaction for 5 h (Fig. 3a,b), and the mineralization rate was about 35% (Fig. 3d). The COx selectivity of MnFe catalysts followed the order of MnFe-120 > MnFe-300-NO3 > MnFe-175 > MnFe-300 (Fig. 3c). MnFe-120 exhibited excellent COx selectivity, about 60%, while the COx selectivity of MnFe-300 was only 20%. Accordingly, it was deduced that the difference in the catalytic activities is related to the surface groups (surface -OH, surface -NO3). MnFe-120 with both surface -OH and -NO3 showed the best performance, followed by MnFe-175 with surface -OH, and MnFe-300-NO3 with surface -NO3 was slightly superior to MnFe-300 without surface groups. Apart from the activity, catalytic stability is also an important indicator of catalytic performance. In the stability experiments (Fig. S8a,b, 0.5 g catalyst), the toluene conversion of MnFe-120 was still greater than 80% after 10 h of the reaction. In addition, to investigate the catalytic activity of the catalyst at low temperatures, the performance evaluation was carried out at different temperatures (Fig. S8c,d). The results showed that raising the reaction temperature contributed to toluene conversion and ozone degradation, which indicated that the MnFe-120 catalyst had good activity and stability of catalytic ozonation of toluene at low temperatures. Compared with the noble metal catalysts (Pt/MnOx-T), the toluene conversion being less than 20% [20], and non-precious metal catalysts (Ru-Mn/HZSM-5) with the best activity reported in the literature (Fig. S9), the toluene conversion being less than 65% [17,21], MnFe-120 exhibited superior catalytic activity, the toluene conversion being larger than 70%. Based on the aforementioned results, the synergistic effect of surface groups (surface -OH, -NO3) is an effective and sustainable strategy for toluene removal. 3.2.2 Effect of humidity on activity To investigate the moisture resistance of the MnFe-120 catalyst, catalytic activities under different humidity were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, the introduction of water inhibits the deactivation of catalyst, and improves the stability of the catalyst. However, as the relative humidity increased from 50% to 70% and 90%, the toluene and ozone conversion decreased. Clearly, water is a double-edged sword in the VOCs catalytic ozonation, the presence of the proper amount of humidity can improve the conversion of toluene. However, the excessive water vapor can occupy the active sites, causing water toxicity and suppressing ozone decomposition, which leads to a decline in reactive oxygen species and catalytic ozonation activity [5]. 3.3 Effect of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) on catalytic ozonation of toluene Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to capture the DMPO-OH and DMPO-O2 - signals by using the spin trap DMPO ( Fig. 5a,b), and the presence of superoxide radical (·O2 -) and hydroxyl radical (·OH) was detected in all catalysts. And the signal intensity was positively correlated with the content of reactive oxygen species. The DMPO-OH and DMPO-O2 - signals were detected after continuous bubbling ozone into water and methanol solutions for a period of time (Fig. 5a,b), respectively, and the amount change trend of·OH and·O2 - of the four catalysts was identical, i.e., MnFe-120 > MnFe-175 > MnFe-300-NO3 > MnFe-300. Clearly, MnFe-120 and MnFe-175 with surface -OH were significantly higher than MnFe-300-NO3 and MnFe-300 without surface -OH. Therefore, there was new evidence inferring that the surface -OH is favorable for the generation of reactive oxygen species [51]. To investigate the roles of·OH and·O2 -, radical scavengers tert-butanol (TBA) and chloroform (Chlo) were chosen to quench·OH and·O2 - in quenching experiments, respectively [55]. As seen from Fig. 5c, the conversion of toluene was inhibited after the addition of TBA in the reaction gas. The removal rate of toluene of MnFe-120 significantly decreased, while the decrease of MnFe-300 and MnFe-300-NO3 was not obvious, which suggested that the presence of surface -OH enhanced the adsorption and decomposition of O3 to produce·OH. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5d, TBA had a significant inhibitory effect under the condition of a wet atmosphere, while Chlo had an obvious inhibitory effect in the dry atmosphere, suggesting that·OH was the main reactive oxygen species in the presence of water, while·O2 - was the main reactive oxygen species in the dry atmosphere. Meanwhile, it also can be seen that a certain amount of·OH was produced under the dry atmosphere, which is because that O3 adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst can interact with surface -OH to generate·OH [26–29]. From the above results, it is concluded that·OH plays a dominant role in the catalytic ozonation of toluene. 3.4 Roles of water on catalytic ozonation of toluene The changes in surface -OH were investigated by in situ DRIFTS tests under both dry and wet conditions ( Fig. 6a,b). The negative peak of 3670 cm−1 in Fig. 6a,b is attributed to the surface -OH consumption [35]. Under the dry condition (Fig. 6a), the peak intensity gradually increased with the reaction, indicating that ozone consumed surface -OH under anhydrous conditions. Interestingly, the peak intensity of surface -OH decreases after switching to the reaction gas containing water vapor (Fig. 6a), suggesting the generation of surface -OH and which supplemented the surface -OH consumed. In Fig. 6b, the consumption of surface -OH of MnFe-120 after the simultaneous introduction of toluene, ozone, and water was significantly lower than that without water (Fig. 6a). It can be inferred that the existence of water vapor effectively compensates for the surface -OH consumed by the interaction with O3. This is due to the fact that the H+ produced by dissociating adsorption water [27] will adsorb on Fe-O produced by ozone depletion of the electrophilic H [30,31] to achieve the regeneration of surface -OH (Fig. 6a,b) [51]. Fig. 6c,d and e,f gave out the ATR-FTIR and NH3-FTIR spectra of the catalysts after the reaction under different humidity and reaction time, respectively. Fig. 6c showed that the surface -OH of the MnFe-120 catalyst declined sharply after a 5 h reaction in the dry atmosphere, while the surface -OH changed lightly under different humidity conditions. This also illustrated that water vapor can maintain the stability of surface -OH, which is consistent with the results of Fig. 6a and b. In addition, the decrease in surface -OH and -NO3 will lead to a reduction in B and L acid sites, respectively (Fig. 6e,f, Fig. S12b). However, the -OH vibration peaks (1637 cm−1) of water [56] were enhanced with the increasing humidity (Fig. 6c), indicating that the higher the humidity, the more adsorbed water accumulated on the surface of the catalyst. Meanwhile, with the reaction time on-stream (Fig. 6d, f), the surface -OH and -NO3 decreased (Fig. 6d), the dissociation of adsorbed water weakened, and adsorbed water gradually accumulated on the surface of the catalyst. The excessive adsorbed water would occupy a good deal of active sites, which was one of the reasons for the degradation of catalyst performance (Fig. 4). 3.5 Synergistic mechanism of surface -OH and -NO3 on catalytic ozonation of toluene It has been reported that hydroxyl radicals (·OH) are strong oxidizing substances with strong electrophilic properties and high redox potential, which can react with VOCs and oxidize toluene to CO2 and H2O eventually [53,57]. The quenching experiments (Fig. 5c,d) also verified that·OH is an important reactive oxygen species in the catalytic ozonation of VOCs [57]. According to the above results, a synergistic effect involved in surface -OH and surface -NO3 on catalytic ozonation of toluene is schematically depicted in Fig. 7. During the reaction, ozone adsorbed on the surface -OH sites and produced·OH and O2. At the same time, the electrophilic H of surface -OH was consumed and transformed into -O- (Fe-O-) [30,31], which can act as the Lewis bases [48]. On the other hand, the surface -NO3 facilitates the adsorption of H2O on the surface -NO3 sites (L acid sites) (Fig. 2c)·H2O adsorbed on the L acid sites dissociates into H+ and·OH [27].·OH further oxidizes toluene, and H+ is then adsorbed on the surface of Fe-O to generate Fe-OH, which compensates for the consumption of surface -OH (Fig. 6a,b) [51]. Herein, the synergistic effect of surface groups (surface -OH and surface -NO3) improves the production of·OH and reinforces the catalytic activity. 4 Conclusion In this paper, a series of MnFe catalysts with different surface groups (-OH, -NO3) were prepared. The MnFe-120 with both surface -OH and surface -NO3 had the best catalytic activity at medium humidity (RH=50%). O3 adsorbed on the surface -OH sites and consumed electrophilic H of surface -OH to produce·OH. Meanwhile, surface -NO3 promoted the formation of more L acid sites, then enhanced the adsorption and dissociation of H2O to produce electrophilic H (H+), which in turn replenished the depleted surface -OH, thus maintaining the stability of surface -OH. The synergistic effects of surface groups (surface -OH and -NO3) increased the amount of hydroxyl radical (·OH) production, which enhanced the performance of catalytic ozonation of toluene. The appropriate amount of water was conducive to the formation of surface -OH because too high water content will cover the reactive sites, resulting in reduced activity. This research figured out the synergistic mechanism of·OH generation by surface groups in-depth and will enrich the theoretical evidence for the construction and application of highly active and moisture-resistant catalysts.

        "dc:description": "A series of MnFe catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis combined with heat treatment at different temperatures. The characterizations demonstrated that MnFe-120 with both surface -OH and -NO3, MnFe-175 with surface -OH, MnFe-300 containing neither surface -OH nor -NO3, and MnFe-300-NO3 containing surface -NO3 were gained by drying or calcination and impregnation. The activity evaluation showed that the order of catalytic activity was MnFe-120 > MnFe-175 > MnFe-300-NO3 > MnFe-300. Further, characterizations and experiment results revealed that O3 adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst can interact with surface -OH and generated hydroxyl radicals (·OH). The presence of surface -NO3 provided more Lewis acid sites, thereby promoting H2O adsorption and conversion to the surface -OH, which supplemented the surface -OH consumed by the interaction with O3. It was deduced that the coexistence of surface -OH and -NO3 improved the production of·OH, which synergistically promoted the catalytic ozonation of toluene.",
