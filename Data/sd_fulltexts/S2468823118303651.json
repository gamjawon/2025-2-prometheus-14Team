Moscow State University Chemical Department Leninskie Gory 11 Moscow 119991 Russia Graphical abstract Four new coordination compounds of nickel (II) with derivatives of N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propylamine were synthesized; their composition and structure were confirmed with IR-spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The structures of products 13 and 15 were unambiguously established in an X-ray diffraction study. Compounds 13 and 15 crystallize in the orthorhombic space groups Pna21 and P2 1 2 1 2 1 correspondingly and represent a monomeric octahedral nickel complexes, that are typical for tridentate scorpion-type ligands. New method for immobilization of nickel complexes with derivatives of N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propylamine on silica gel modified with aminopropyl groups was proposed. The EXAFS/XANES analysis indicated that Ni atom in the supported complexes adopt almost octahedral geometry, being partly surrounded by nitrogen atoms from organic ligand and partly grafted to silica surface through silanol groups, with Br− in outer coordination sphere. Both the original and the supported complexes, when activated with Et2AlCl or Et3Al2Cl3, catalyze ethylene oligomerization with the predominant formation of butene isomers. Generally, the immobilized complexes show higher activity and better selectivity towards 1-butene formation. Keywords Ethylene Oligomerization Nickel (II) complexes Homogenous catalyst Supported catalyst 1 Introduction Recently, late transition metal catalyzed olefin polymerization has attracted of a lot of attention [1,2]. One of the most important reasons for the recent interest in late transition metal-based olefin polymerization/oligomerization catalysts is their high tolerance towards polar functional groups. [3–10]. Simultaneously, the search for new selective catalysts capable of converting ethylene into light alkenes, 1-butene and 1-hexene, is attracting increased attention because these olefins are widely used in the manufacture of different products such as detergents, plasticizers, components of lubricating oils and low-density polyethylene resins [11]. Despite the fact that the most used co-monomers for the production of LLDPE or POE are 1-hexene and 1-octene, 1-butene is also employed [12,13]. More broadly, light olefins are basic building blocks of the petrochemical industry. A significant complication that arises during catalytic oligomerization of ethylene is the formation of high-molecular weight byproducts (polyethylene waxes), that can cause significant difficulties in industrial production [14]. Today, several approaches for supporting of oligomerization catalysts on different carriers are being developed to overcome these difficulties [15]. One of the strategies is the use of ionic liquids. Chloroaluminate ionic liquids are used as a solvent and a co-catalyst [16,17]. Conducting oligomerization reactions in biphasic systems facilitates product separation from the reaction medium and the reuse of the catalyst. An alternative strategy is catalyst immobilization on the solid substrates such as modified silica for deposition of transition metal complexes. Immobilization of homogeneous catalysts is often accompanied by a decrease of the catalyst activity and by changes in selectivity. We examined several homogeneous and heterogeneous ethylene oligomerization catalysts based on Ni(II) complexes with neutral NNN-type aminopyrazole ligands. Examples of similar compounds previously described in literature are shown in Chart 1 (complexes A-H). Several of these compounds were earlier investigated as parts of catalytic systems for ethylene oligomerization (complexes A-C) [18], catalysts for butadiene polymerization (complexes E-F) [19,20] or methyl methacrylate polymerization (complex H) [21], other complexes (D and G) were synthesized but were not studied as catalysts [22,23]. A large number of Rh(I), Ru(II), Pd(II), Pt(II) and Zn(II) complexes stabilized by amine-pyrazolyl tripodal ligands and exhibiting useful chemical properties are also described [24–29]. In the present work, four new complexes of NiBr2 with N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propyl amines (Scheme 1 , complexes 13-16) were synthesized, and a new method for their immobilization on silica modified with aminopropyl groups, was proposed. The properties of these complexes, activated with Et2AlCl or Et3Al2Cl3, as catalysts for ethylene oligomerization were investigated, as well as the impact of PPh3 on the catalyst performance. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis and characterization of Ni complexes Tridentate nitrogen-bridged bispyrazol-1-yl ligands are widely used in coordination chemistry. Ligands 9-12, used in the present study, were obtained with high yields by the interaction of primary amines and 1-oxymethylpyrazole derivatives 5-8 in a dichloromethane medium. This synthetic route was adapted from [30–32]. Another efficient synthesis of these ligands under microwave irradiation and without a solvent was reported [20]. The 1-oxymethylpyrazole derivatives 5-8 were prepared according to reported methods [33]. N,N-bis((3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methyl)propylamine was immobilized on silica 17a, 17b, 17c and 17d using methods analogous to compounds 9-12 in acetonitrile instead of dichloromethane. Complexes 13-16 were synthesized by adding NiBr2(dme) solution in acetonitrile to a solution of corresponding ligand 9-12 and stirring for one day. Green crystals of·13 CH3CN and 15 CH3CN which are suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained by diffusion of Et2O at room temperature into acetonitrile solution of the complexes. Due to the paramagnetic nature of these complexes, their 1H NMR spectra featured very broad resonances and the presence of signals of several compounds makes it impossible to unambiguously interpret the spectra (Fig. S10, supporting information). The composition of complexes 13-16 was established by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. IR spectra of complexes 13-16 showed characteristic bands at 409-479 cm−1, attributed to stretching vibrations ν(N→Ni). The structures of complexes 13 and 15 were unambiguously established by X-ray diffraction study, they are shown in Fig. 1 along with atomic numbering schemes. The pertinent bond lengths and angles are given in Table S1 (supplementary). The compound 13 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pna21 and represents a monomeric octahedral Ni complex (Fig. 1A). The Ni atom is surrounded by three nitrogen atoms of the N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propylamine ligand, two bromide ligands are in the cis positions to the nitrogen atom of a solvent molecule (acetonitrile). Thus, the organic ligand is tridentate and forms two chelate five-membered rings in the envelope conformations. The pyrazole rings occupy cis positions in the coordination sphere of the Ni atom at the inter-plane angle of 85.8(5)°. The octahedral geometry of the Ni atom in 13 is substantially distorted; the bond angles vary between 76.3(4) and 99.24(7)° (Table S1). As expected, the Ni1N3 (amine) bond of the tripodal ligand is elongated in comparison to the Ni1N1 and Ni1N4 (pyrazole) bonds. It seems to be typical of tridentate scorpion-type ligands [31,34–38]. The Ni1N6 bond length is close to those for the NiN (pyrazole) bonds (Table S1). The Ni1Br1 bond is slightly longer than the Ni1Br2 bond due to the trans-effect. The coordination angle of the acetonitrile molecule to the Ni atom deviates from linearity [171.8(9)°]. In the crystal of 13, molecules form H-bonded chains propagating toward [100] by the intermolecular bifurcate CH⋅⋅⋅Br hydrogen bonds [C5H5B⋅⋅⋅Br1 (½+ x, ½– y, z), C⋅⋅⋅Br 3.533(12), H⋅⋅⋅Br 2.91 Å, ∠CH⋅⋅⋅Br 122° and C5H5B⋅⋅⋅Br2 (½+ x, ½– y, z), C⋅⋅⋅Br 3.705(12), H⋅⋅⋅Br 2.83 Å, ∠CH⋅⋅⋅Br 148°]. The chains are bound to each other by intermolecular CH⋅⋅⋅Br hydrogen bonds [C13H13B⋅⋅⋅Br1 (x, y, –1+ z), C⋅⋅⋅Br 3.806(15), H⋅⋅⋅Br 2.91 Å, ∠CH⋅⋅⋅Br 152°] into the layers parallel to the (010) plane (Figure S10). The compound 15 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 and also represents a monomeric octahedral Ni complex with a tripodal organic ligand – N,N-bis(1-(3,5-dimethyl-4-bromo-pyrazolylmethyl)amine (Fig. 1B). However, unlike 13, the pyrazole rings of the tripodal ligand in 15 occupy trans positions in the coordination sphere of the Ni atom at the inter-plane angle of 15.8(5)°. Apparently, this conformation is explained by a steric repulsion between the methyl substituents of the pyrazole rings. As a result, the two bromide ligands are trans to each other, and the coordinated solvent (acetonitrile) molecule is in trans position to the N3 (amine) atom of the tripodal ligand. The two chelate five-membered rings also have the envelope conformations. The octahedral geometry of the Ni atom in 15 is also substantially distorted; the bond angles vary between 78.9(3) and 98.8(2)° (Table S1). The Ni1N3 (amine) bond of the tripodal ligand in 15 is shortened in comparison to that in 13, and the Ni1N6 bond lengths are almost equal to each other in both complexes (Table S1). It is interesting to note that the two NiBr bond lengths in 15 are considerably different (2.5794(16) and 2.7249(17) Å). The acetonitrile molecule is bonded to the nickel atom at the bond angle of 163.1(8)°. Contrary to 13, molecules of 15 form in the crystal a three-dimensional framework via intermolecular secondary Br⋅⋅⋅Br interactions [Br1⋅⋅⋅Br4 (1–x, –½+ y, 1½– z) 3.4701(17) Å and Br2⋅⋅⋅Br3 (½+ x, ½– y, 1–z) 3.5197(17) Å] and CH⋅⋅⋅Br hydrogen bonds [C5H5A⋅⋅⋅Br1 (1+ x, y, z), C⋅⋅⋅Br 3.662(8), H⋅⋅⋅Br 2.86 Å, ∠CH⋅⋅⋅Br 139°] (Figure S11). Complexes 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d immobilized on silica were prepared by the same procedure; only the reaction was conducted for 4–5 days. Diasorb silica gel with grafted aminopropyl groups and with different pore diameters, Diasorb-60-amine, Diasorb-100-amine, Diasorb-300-amine and Diasorb-500-amine were used as amine components (Scheme 2 ). The composition of complexes 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d was established by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and XANES/EXAFS spectroscopy. The grafted catalysts 18a and 18b have been characterized using Ni K-edge and Br K-edge XANES/EXAFS spectroscopy. The relevant data characterizing the local structure around Ni and Br atoms are shown in Fig. 2 . Experimental data for these two catalysts were compared with those of pristine complex 13. According to Ni K-edge EXAFS, Ni atoms in pristine complex 13 are surrounded by N (coordination number 4) and Br (coordination number 2) atoms in full agreement with the crystallographic data. In contrast, in both grafted catalysts, the Ni coordination is rather close to octahedral one composed of only second-period elements (N and/or O) with only minor contribution of Ni-Br. Probably, this means that complex is grafted to the silica support partly through the dissociation of Ni-Br bonds and formation of Ni-O bonds with surface silanol groups of the substrate. Br atoms are expelled to outer coordination sphere of Ni presumably as weakly electrostatically bound anions Br−. Several possible structures for this type of immobilization can be proposed (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, this methodology does not allow a more precise characterization of the structure of the grafted complexes. 2.2 Ethylene oligomerization reactions Catalytic properties of complexes 13-16 in the presence of Et2AlCl and Et3Al2Cl3 as cocatalysts were investigated. The earlier results [17] showed a better stabilization of catalytic systems when Et2AlCl was used instead of MAO. The results are shown in Table 1 . All the catalyst systems oligomerize ethylene to mixtures of light products, mostly butenes and hexenes. When Et2AlCl was used, the oligomerization activity of all complexes was slightly higher and their selectivity toward butenes was generally the same. When Et3Al2Cl3 was used as a cocatalyst, the content of 1-butene in the butene mixture was higher and reached 50%. The nature of organoaluminum cocatalyst has a considerable but ambiguous effect on the activity and selectivity of the catalytic systems. There is only one general trend in nickel catalyzed carbon–carbon bond formation: organochloroaluminate cocatalysts lead to formation of more active systems than those obtained with organoaluminate cocatalysts (examples see in [39–44]). General patterns that allow us to explain the differences in the activating ability in a series of structurally close organoaluminum compounds – EtAlCl2, Et3Al2Cl3 and Et2AlCl are not revealed and are determined by the structure of the nickel complex. Probably, for each individual complex, the processes of alkylation of the complex and stabilization of the cationic intermediate have their own specifics. Addition of PPh3 to catalytic systems 14/Et2AlCl and 14/Et3Al2Cl3 system has no positive effect on catalytic activity. In case of 14/Et2AlCl/PPh3 (Table 2 , run 7) a slight decrease in activity was observed, and in case of 14/Et3Al2Cl3/PPh3 (Table 2, run 8) an unexpected complete deactivation had occurred. To discuss these results further a mechanistic investigation of the PPh3 role in oligomerization process for these systems should be conducted. According to the literature the addition of Ph3P can significantly increase the activity of catalytic systems based on nickel [45–49]. The phosphine role can be explained not only by the reversible coordination with nickel atom that can facilitate the formation of vacant coordination sites required for the realization of catalytic activity. Probably, the coordination of triphenylphosphine molecule can prevent rearrangement of complexes to more thermodynamically advantageous, but catalytically inactive structures with the formula [L2Ni2+][NiHal4]2− [50]. An increase of the [cocatalyst]/[Ni] ratio from 75 to 150 (Table 1, runs 3,5) only slightly affects the productivity of the 14/Et2AlCl system, but the share of 1-butene in the butene fraction increases from 25% to 34%. Complexes 15 and 16, when activated with either Et2AlCl or Et3Al2Cl3, showed a significantly lower activity compared to complexes 13 and 14 (Table 1, runs 9–12). This lower activity can be attributed to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups in the 4th position of the pyrazole ring. During the analysis of oligomeric mixtures, it was found that the catalytic systems under investigation are able not only to oligomerize ethylene, but also are able to catalyze the alkylation of toluene with the resulting terminal oligomers. Previously, a number of papers have been published in the literature, where nickel-based catalytic systems exhibit similar properties [51–54]. Thus, for example, the precatalyst 14 when activated by 75 equiv. of Et2AlCl (run 4, Table 1), catalyzed the formation of alkyltoluenes, predominantly mono- and dibutyltoluenes (supporting information, Fig. S12 and Table S3) The second goal of this study was the investigation of immobilization of Ni(II) complexes on silica modified with the aminopropyl group as catalysts of ethylene oligomerization. Complex 14 was supported on modified silica with four different pore diameter resulting in precatalysts 18a-d that were activated with Et2AlCl and a combination of Et2AlCl and PPh3. The oligomerization results with the supported complexes 18a-d are given in Table 2. The following effects were observed: 1 Activity of all immobilized catalysts exceeded the activity of the homogeneous 14 - Et2AlCl system. 2 The fraction of 1-butene in butene mixtures significantly increased and reached 60–70%. 3 Triphenyl phosphine greatly increases the activity of all supported catalysts (up to 5 times), while noticeably reducing their selectivity toward 1-butene. 4 As the pore diameter of the support increases, the productivity of the supported catalyst gradually decreases from ˜160 to 92 kg mol−1 h−1 atm−1 (Table 2, runs 1, 3, 5, 7). The same tendency was observed for the PPh3-modified catalysts; their productivity decreased from ˜500 to 121 kg mol−1 h−1 atm−1 (Table 2, runs 4, 6, 8). It is obvious that the reason for such significant differences in the catalytic activity of homogeneous and heterogeneous pre-catalysts is the structure of the metal environment. Nickel atom in homogenous complexes 13-16 have an orthorhombic environment created by bromine atoms and three nitrogen of the ligand. On the contrary, in the supported pre-catalysts 18a-d, the coordination sphere of Ni atom is rather close to octahedral composed of only second-period elements (N and/or O) with only minor contribution of Ni-Br. This coordination structure further readily transforms to yield real active species upon activation with Et2AlCl or Et2AlCl/PPh3. The thermal stability of immobilized pre-catalysts was investigated (Table 2, runs 10,11). Even a slight increase of the temperature from 30 to 40–50 °C is accompanied by a noticeable decrease in activity. For a quantitative assessment of the process of leaching of nickel from the surface of the supported catalyst after its separation, an aliquot of the reaction medium was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence method. It is shown that the content of nickel compounds in the filtrate does not exceed 3.8–4.1% 2.3 Chemistry and mechanism of ethylene oligomerization reaction GC and 13C NMR analysis of ethylene oligomers produced important information about the mechanism of the oligomerization reaction. When the formation of very light oligomer mixtures is observed, as in the present case, two product formation mechanisms should be considered. They are shown in Scheme 3 ( L stands for a ligand and M for a transition metal atom). The first mechanism, alkene insertion into a transition metal-carbon bond, is the standard polymer-chain growth mechanism, the mechanism of olefin polymerization with all types of transition metal catalysts - see a review [55]. According to this mechanism, light ethylene oligomers are generated in the case of a very high probability of a chain transfer reaction (β-H elimination) with the formation of the LM –H bond and an alkene molecule. The second mechanism proposes alkene dimerization via a metallocyclopentane intermediate [56–58]. The structure of ethylene dimers according to both mechanisms is the same, 1-butene and 2-butenes, but the structure of the C6 products is different: the ethylene insertion mechanism predicts the formation of linear ethylene trimers whereas according to the metallocycle mechanism the C6 products are codimers of ethylene and butenes, branched alkenes. Fig. 3 shows the 13C NMR spectrum (the Carom range) of ethylene oligomers produced with the 13 - Et2AlCl system (the system exhibiting the highest activity – see Table 1). The spectrum, apart from large signal of toluene (125.6, 128.6, 128.8, 137.8 ppm), contains signals of 1-butene (113.2, 140.6 ppm), trans-2-butene (125.1 ppm), cis-2-butene (124.6 ppm), trans-2-hexene (124.8, 131.5 ppm), cis-2-hexene (131.0 ppm). Signals of C6 products expected for ethylene/butene codimers (Scheme 4 ), such as 3-methyl-1-pentene (expected signal at 145.0 ppm), 2-ethyl-1-butene (152.6 ppm), 3-methyl-2-pentene (117.2 ppm), are absent from the spectrum. Thus, the most probable formation mechanism of ethylene oligomers produced with Ni(II) tripodal complexes is the standard chain growth mechanism via ethylene insertion into a Ni-C bond. Scheme 4 shows the proposed mechanism of ethylene oligomerization with tripodal Ni complexes. The scheme incorporates general features of ethylene polymerization reactions with Ni-based catalysts [59–67]: 1 The active centers are ion pairs with a positive charge mostly centered on the Ni atom. 2 The resting stage in the chain-formation process is an active center containing the NiH bond. 3 The Ni-alkyl species have a tendency to isomerize with the formation of more thermodynamically stable Ni sec C bond (a “chain-walking” reaction). The latter reaction explains the formation of large quantities of cis- and trans-2-alkenes (Tables 1 and 2). Table 3 shows the distribution of isomers in oligomerization products prepared with four catalysts as well as contents of the isomers under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium (calculated using ΔG ° values at 300 K from [68]). The comparison of the experimentally measured and calculated isomer distributions reveals two kinetic features of the oligomerization reactions (see Scheme 5): 1 High yields of 1-alkenes in all four examples indicate that the rates of 1-butene release from the LNi+–n-C4H9 species and 1-hexene release from the LNi+–n-C6H13 species are significantly higher than the rates of chain-walking steps in the respective species. 2 In most cases, the release of 2-alkenes from the LNi+–sec-C4H9 and the LNi+–sec-C6H13 species formed in the chain-walking reactions proceeds quite rapidly and isomerization of the species (which leads to changes in the [trans]/[cis] ratios) do not come to an equilibrium. 3 Experimental 3.1 Materials and methods All manipulations with air-sensitive materials were performed with rigorous exclusion of oxygen and moisture in oven-dried Schlenk glassware on a dual manifold Schlenk line, interfaced to a high-vacuum line. Argon and ethylene of special-purity grade (Linde gas) were dried by purging through a Super Clean™ Gas Filters. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Petroleum ether and diethyl ether were distilled over Na/benzophenone ketyl. Dichloromethane was distilled over calcium hydride. Acetonitrile was refluxed with P2O5 two times and then distilled. The water contents in these solvents were periodically controlled by Karl-Fischer coulometry by using a Methrom 756 K F. 1-Hydroxymethylpyrazole 5, 1-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole 6, 1-hydroxymethyl-4-bromo-3,5-dimethyl-pyrazole 7 and 1-hydroxymethyl-4-nitro-3,5-dimethylpyrazole 8 were prepared by following literature procedures [33]; their 1H and 13C NMR spectra were found to match the published data. Dimethoxyethane complex of nickel (II) bromide was synthesized using the following literature procedure [69]. The aminopropyl silica gels Diasorb-60 amine, Diasorb-100 amine, Diasorb-300 amine and Diasorb-500 amine were purchased from ZAO “BioChemMakST”, Russian Federation and had following parameters: pore diameter 60, 100, 300 and 500 A, grain size 63–100, 63–200, 100–200 and 200–315 μm, surface area 100 and 40 m2 g−1, correspondingly, 3-aminopropyl group loading of 0.5 mmol·g−1. The silica gel was washed with water and dried at 100–105 °C for several hours under vacuum before use for aminopropyl group modification. 3.2 Physical and analytical measurements NMR spectra were recorded on Avance-400. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm vs. SiMe4 and were determined by reference to the residual solvent peaks. All coupling constants are given in Hertz. IR spectra (KBr pellets) were recorded on a Magna-IR 750 spectrophotometer. For compounds identification and bands matching spectra of both ligands 9-12 and complexes 13-16 were recorded in the same conditions. Elemental analysis was performed by the microanalytical laboratory at A. N. Nesmeyanov Institute of Organoelement Compounds. X-ray fluorescence analysis was performed on a VRA-30 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Mass spectra under atmospheric pressure electrospray (ESI) were recorded in the full scan mass of positive and negative ions on the dynamic tandem mass spectrometer Finnigan LCQ Advantage (USA), equipped with a mass analyzer oktapol ion trap pump MS Surveyor, Surveyor autosampler, nitrogen generator Schmidlin-Lab (Germany) and a system for collecting and processing the data using the X Calibur program (version 1.3, Finnegan). Transfer capillary temperature of 150 °C, voltage field between the needle and counter electrode 4.5 kV. Samples were introduced into the ion source with the input syringe acetonitrile at a 50 ml/min flow rate through the 5 mL Reodyne injector loop. The geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations of the compounds were performed using Gaussian 09 program with B3LYP/TZVP level of theory. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for 13 and 15 were collected on the ‘Belok’ beamline (λ = 0.96990 Å) of the National Research Center ‘Kurchatov Institute’ (Moscow, Russian Federation) using a Rayonix SX165 CCD detector [70]. In total, 720 frames were collected with an oscillation range of 1.0° in the φ scanning mode using two different orientations for each crystal. The semi-empirical correction for absorption was applied using the Scala program [71]. The data were indexed and integrated using the utility iMOSFLM from the CCP4 software suite [72,73]. For details, see Table 2. The structures were solved by intrinsic phasing modification of direct methods [74] and refined by a full-matrix least-squares technique on F 2 with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms in 13 and 15 were placed in calculated positions and refined within the riding model with fixed isotropic displacement parameters [U iso(H) = 1.5Ueq(C) for the methyl groups and 1.2U eq(C) for the other groups]. All calculations were carried out using the SHELXTL program suite [76]. Crystallographic data for 13 and 15 were deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC 1583973 and CCDC 1583974, respectively. The supplementary crystallographic data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. Ni K-edge and Br K-edge XANES/EXAFS spectra were recorded at the Kurchatov Sycnhrotron Radiation Source (NRC \"Kurchatov Institute\", Moscow). 3.3 Synthesis of ligands and Ni complexes N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methyl)propylamine (9) was prepared in a similar procedure as described in the literature [30]. 1-Hydroxymethylpyrazole 5 (1 g, 10 mmol) and 1-propylamine (0.295 g, 5 mmol) were dissolved in 25 ml of dried dichloromethane following by 5 g of calcinated sodium sulfate and were refluxed for 24 h. Then sodium sulfate was filtered off and washed with dichloromethane (3 x 5 ml) and combined organic fraction was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The obtained oil was dissolved in CCl4 (15 ml) and the solvent was rotary evaporated at high temperature (80 оC) to remove residual amine and water, the procedure was repeated two times. Then the oil was treated with hot petroleum ether (2х5 ml) and dichloromethane (0.5 ml) and cooled to crystallization. After 3 days the colorless crystals were filtered off, washed with petroleum ether (2х5 ml) and dried on air.

N,N -bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methyl)propylamines immobilized on silica with different pore diameter (17a-d) To a solution of the 3,5-dimethyl-1-hydroxymethyl-pyrazole 6 (0.5 g, 5 mmol) in dried acetonitrile (25 ml) silica-supported n-PrNH2 (1 g) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4–5 days. Filtration and multiple rigorous washing steps (EtOH, CH3CN, CH2Cl2 and Et2O) of the silica-supported tripodal ligand were performed to remove residual, non-covalently bound, 3,5-dimethyl-1-hydroxymethylpyrazole. The modification of silica-supported n-PrNH2 via an N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)methyl fragment was confirmed by IR spectroscopy and electrochemistry, through comparison of the starting material - silica gels Diasorb-amine and its homogeneous analogue. N,N -bis((3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methyl)propylamine nickel(II) dibromide immobilized on silica with different pore diameter. The corresponding N,N-bis((3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methyl)propyl-amine immobilized on silica (18a-d) was suspended in methanol. To this suspension a solution of NiBr2 in methanol was added and the corresponding mixture was stirred for 4–5 days. Then the greenish solid was filtered off and washed thrice with methanol (10 ml) to yield a desired immobilized complex, which was further dried in vacuo. 18a: Pore diameter 60 A. Anal.

Before the experiment, the reactor was heated up to 100 °C and kept under vacuum for 10 min to eliminate residual moisture. Then it was cooled, filled with 38 mL toluene and loaded with a necessary amount of a cocatalyst (Et2AlCl or Et3Al2Cl3) solution in 10 ml toluene. The reactor was heated to 30 °C solution of a Ni complex or slurry of a supported catalyst in 2 ml of toluene was introduced to it and the reactor was pressurized with ethylene to an excessive pressure of 2.9 atm. Oligomerization reactions were carried out at a constant pressure for 30 min, then the reaction was quickly cooled and its content was quenched with 15 ml of isopropanol and 10 ml of 5% HCl. The organic phase was dried with Na2SO4 and analyzed by GC and GC–MS. Between analyses, the samples were stored in sealed flasks in a refrigerator. GC analysis was performed on Chromatech-Crystall 5000.2 chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column Restek Rt®-Alumina BOND/MAPD (length 50 m, inner diameter 0,53 mm). GC conditions: starting temperature 70 °C for 5 min, the heating rate 10 °C/min up to 200 °C.

        "dc:description": "Four new coordination compounds of nickel (II) with derivatives of N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propylamine were synthesized; their composition and structure were confirmed with IR-spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The structures of products 13 and 15 were unambiguously established in an X-ray diffraction study. Compounds 13 and 15 crystallize in the orthorhombic space groups Pna21 and P2 1 2 1 2 1 correspondingly and represent a monomeric octahedral nickel complexes, that are typical for tridentate scorpion-type ligands. New method for immobilization of nickel complexes with derivatives of N,N-bis(pyrazol-1-ylmethyl)propylamine on silica gel modified with aminopropyl groups was proposed. The EXAFS/XANES analysis indicated that Ni atom in the supported complexes adopt almost octahedral geometry, being partly surrounded by nitrogen atoms from organic ligand and partly grafted to silica surface through silanol groups, with Br− in outer coordination sphere. Both the original and the supported complexes, when activated with Et2AlCl or Et3Al2Cl3, catalyze ethylene oligomerization with the predominant formation of butene isomers. Generally, the immobilized complexes show higher activity and better selectivity towards 1-butene formation.",
