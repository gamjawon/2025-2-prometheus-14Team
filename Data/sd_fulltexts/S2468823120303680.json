Graphical abstract A series of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 (x = 2, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 40) catalysts obtained by oxalate co-precipitation method are characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, Raman, EPR, H2-TPR, CO2/H2-TPD and high pressure (3 MPa) in situ DRITFS techniques in order to elucidate the effect of CuO loading on the catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Catalytic activity results demonstrate that CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity enhance with an increase of the CuO loading until it reaches the maximum values at a CuO loading of 35 wt.%, while further addition of CuO inhibits the catalytic performance. The higher CO2 conversion of 7.0 % (13.2 %) and methanol selectivity of 96.4 % (71.8 %) are obtained over 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst at 220 °C (280 °C) and 3 MPa. The excellent performance of 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 is attributed to the presence of adequate copper species with higher copper surface area and larger number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution. These two features are benefit to provide larger number of activated hydrogen atom and promote CO2 adsorption, respectively, which are the key to the hydrogenation reaction related to the hydrogen dissociation and the activation of the carbon dioxide. Keywords CuO loading Methanol synthesis CO2 hydrogenation Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 1 Introduction An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration caused by continuing consumption of fossil fuels leads to global climate change, which has become a major challenge [1]. Hence, numerous countries are addressing this issue through concrete actions to promote the “low carbon economy”. An efficient utilization of CO2 regarded as a renewable carbon resource is beneficial to maintain a sustainable development of the society [2]. Methanol synthesis from hydrogenation of CO2 is a significant method of CO2 utilization. Methanol with an easily stored and transported feature has a positive effect on many industrial fields due to its vast potentiality [3]. The copper-based catalysts remain an attractive target in the methanol synthesis due to their relatively low price and efficient activity [4]. There is a general consensus on the role of copper as an active site for H2 dissociation in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [5]. It is generally acknowledged that H atom migrates from the copper surface to the oxides for copper-based catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. For example, the Cu/ZrO2/SiO2 sample, CO2 adsorbs on the ZrO2 as carbonate and/or bicarbonate species, which then reacts with H atom that spillover from Cu sites to form HCOO-Zr and HCO3-Zr species, finally the target product methanol [6]. A similar reaction path is also observed on Cu-ZnO/ZrO2 [7] and ZnCuCe [8] catalysts. Hence, according to the dual-site mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation over the copper-based catalyst, the adsorption and the activation of CO2 molecular occur on the surface of metal oxides [9,10]. Meantime, the nature of copper species varies with different metal oxides, then playing a significant role in catalytic performance [11,12]. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate metal oxide to improve catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol by regulating the ability of reactant gas (CO2 and H2) adsorption and activation as well as the nature of copper species. Ceria-zirconia solid solution is a good candidate regarded as the catalyst support and applied in various heterogeneous catalytic reactions due to their attractive thermal/chemical/mechanical properties [13–15]. It is also demonstrated that ceria-zirconia solid solution is able to generate oxygen vacancies during the catalyst preparation and reduction process for CO2 methanation, which can facilitate CO2 activation [16]. However, ceria-zirconia solid solution is rarely studied as catalyst supports for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. In our previous work, it has been demonstrated that Zr/Ce molar ratio has a significant effect on catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over CuO/Ce1-xZrxO2 samples. And the stronger interaction effect over CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst contributes to the remarkable catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [17]. Although the function of copper in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has been put forward [18]. Further effort is required to understand the nature of the active species of catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Copper content is regarded as one of the most significant factors to determine the activity of copper-based catalysts for the methanol synthesis from CO2+H2, as copper content is closely associated with the dispersion of metallic copper, which is a main active site in the methanol synthesis. Being an active site, increase in copper content will improve catalyst performance but there is always an optimum amount above which catalytic performance is going to start decreasing. Various appropriate concentrations of copper have been reported for different types of catalyst [19,20]. However, the optimal number of copper over ceria-zirconia solid solution is not univocal. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of CuO loading on the structural properties and activity profile of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 (x = 2, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 40) catalysts. It is speculated that the availability of the activated H2 and CO2 on the copper-based catalysts is associated with the nature of copper species. Moreover, the properties of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts are characterized via various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET), Raman spectrometry (Raman), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD), temperature programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to investigate the role of copper species. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst characterization The BET surface area (S BET) of all the tested catalysts with different CuO contents was determined by N2-physisorption using a QUADRASORB SI. Before measurements, samples were degassed under vacuum at 200 °C for more than 4 h. The morphology of the synthesized catalysts was performed on a JSM-5600LV (SEM). The crystallinity and phase of samples were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with a D/max 22,000 using Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.542 Å). XRD data were measured at room temperature from 20° to 80° at 2θ Bragg angle with a step size of 0.02° and a time/step of 11 s. Raman spectra were obtained on a LabRam HR800. The resolution is±1 cm−1. All the samples need to be pressed before measurement. EPR spectra of the calcined samples were recorded on a Bruker (A200−9.5/12) equipment operating at the X band at 77 K. Before measurement, all the sample were heated from room temperature to 100 °C for 20 min. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) studies were carried out on an PCA-1200 chemical adsorption instrument to study the copper dispersion and reducibility. Typically, the calcined sample (0.05 g) was put in a U-shaped quartz tube. Prior to TPR studies, inert N2 gas (30 mL/min) was exposed into the system at temperature of 200 °C for half an hour to pretreat the samples. After this procedure, when the temperature was cooled to around 30 °C, TPR analysis was carried out in a flow of 10 % H2-N2 (50 mL/min) from 30 °C to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Furthermore, the exposed Cu surface area (S Cu), Cu dispersion (D Cu) and Cu particle size (d Cu) were measured by N2O chemisorption calculating with TPR results [21]. In brief, the catalysts went through H2-TPR procedures twice, the amount of H2 consumption in the first TPR was denoted as X, the H2 consumption in the second TPR was denoted as Y (after 20 % N2O/N2 oxidation). S Cu = 2 × Y × Nav/(X × MCu×1.4 × 1019) = 1353 × Y/X (m2-Cu/g-Cu) D Cu = (2 × Y/X)×100 % d Cu = 6/(S×ρCu) ≈ 0.5 × X/Y (nm) Nav is Avogadro’s constant; ρCu is the density of Cu (8.92 g/cm3); MCu is the relative atomic mass of copper (63.46 g/mol); 1.4 × 1019 is the number of Cu atom of per square meter. CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments were carried out in a home-made quartz tubular reactor. In a typical experiment for CO2-TPD studies, the H2-reduced samples were treatment with He (50 mL/min) at 310 °C for half an hour. Then, the samples were saturated with V CO2/V He = 1:3 (total rate, 60 mL/min) for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the samples were flushed with He flow (50 mL/min) for 1 h. CO2-TPD experiment was then operated at 30−400 °C and heating rate of 10 °C/min. H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) were performed as the same step as CO2-TPD, differently, the catalyst was saturated with H2 diluting with He instead of CO2 and He. What’s more, the analysis was performed from 30 °C to 800 °C. The high pressure in situ DRIFTS were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and with an accumulation of 32 scans every 30 s during the temperature ramp on a VERTEX70 equipment with a stainless steel cell for observation under 280 °C and 3 MPa environment. The data were analyzed by the OPUS software. Background correction of the spectra was achieved by subtracting the spectra of the clean wafers at each temperature. Once the H2-reduced catalyst was placed in the cell, it was firstly pretreatment in N2 atmosphere (60 mL/min) for 30 min at 200 °C. Next, the system was heated to the temperature of 280 °C in a flow (60 mL/min) of a mixture of CO2 with N2 (V CO2/V He = 1:3) for 0.5 h. Then the sample was exposed to N2 atmosphere for 1 h. Finally, the sample was kept in H2 (45 mL/min) diluted in CO2 (15 mL/min) for 1 h–2 h. Spectras were recorded in all the above-mentioned steps. The in situ DRIFTS spectra shown were expressed in units of Kubelka-Monk. 2.2 Catalyst preparation A appropriate amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Zr(NO3)4·5H2O used as metal precursors were dissolved in ethanol solution at 70 °C under stirring. Then an excess H2C2O4·2H2O (0.2 mol/L) solution was added slowly dropwise into the above mixed solution at 70 °C under stirring for 1 h. After 2 h aging, the slurry was filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol. The catalyst was dried at 80 °C for 12 h followed by calcination at 450 °C for 4 h. The obtained samples were named as x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst (x = 2, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 40 wt.%). The catalyst samples were denoted as x-CuO, where x represented the CuO loading. According to ICP result, it was inferred that the actual copper contents of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 (x = 2, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 40 wt.%) are close to those of theoretical copper contents. 2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was performed in a fixed bed reactor. 0.5 g of the synthesized catalyst was loaded into a fixed bed home-made stainless steel tube reactor (an inner diameter of 4 mm and a length of 460 mm). Prior to reaction, the calcined catalyst was reduced using pure H2 (50 mL/min) at 300 °C for 3 h under atmospheric pressure. Then the reaction was taking place at 200−300 °C, 3 MPa and 10,000 h−1 with reactant gas H2/CO2 of 3 M ratio. All the post-reactor valves and lines were heated to 100 °C in order to prevent product condensation. The remaining reactant and by product CO were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC7890 T) equipped with PQ columns. Methanol and other hydrocarbons were analyzed using FID detector (GC7900) with capillary column. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Textural and structural properties Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of calcined x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.9° and 56.9° in the XRD patterns of all samples are corresponded to the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 sample. For the 2-CuO, and 5-CuO samples, the peaks associated with Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 are almost same to the pure Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 solid solution. Hence, the cell parameters (α) of both samples are equal to that of pure Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 solid solution (Table 1 ). However, these peaks on 15-CuO, 25-CuO, 35-CuO and 40-CuO catalysts shift to higher 2θ value compared with pure Ce0.4Zr0.6O2. Accordingly, the cell parameters (α) of these samples decrease, changing from 5.238 (15-CuO), 5.231 (25-CuO), 5.158 (35-CuO) to 5.232 (40-CuO), which implies that Cu2+ species have been incorporated into the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 lattice to form Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution [22] on high loading of CuO (≧15 wt.%) while not form on low loading of CuO (2 and 5 wt.%). Additionally, the most marked change is observed over 35-CuO, demonstrating the formation of the largest number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution [23]. No crystalline CuO is observed on the 2-CuO, 5-CuO samples since the loading amount is less than the dispersion capacity of CuO supported on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 solid solution [24]. When the CuO loading amount exceeds the definite value, the particles of crystalline CuO form [25]. Hence, two CuO characteristic peaks (2θ = 35.5°and 38.7°) appear noticeably when CuO loading is increased to 15 wt.%. These peaks are intensified when CuO loading is increased from 15 to 40 wt.%. This implies that the degree of CuO crystallization is enhanced by increasing the content of CuO. Surprisingly, the crystallite size of CuO species do not increase as expected with increasing of CuO loading. The CuO peak is slightly broadened with the increase of CuO from 15 to 35 wt.%. The peak width is progressively narrowed down as further increase CuO loading to 40 wt.%. The CuO crystallite size, estimated by Scherrer equation, of 15-CuO, 25-CuO, 35-CuO and 40-CuO is 21.1, 19.7, 13.6 and 29.4 nm, respectively (Table 1). The reason for this phenomenon may be that the CuO is likely inserted into the crystal lattice of Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 to form a Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution over 35-CuO [26,27]. The XRD pattern of four representative H2-reduced 2-CuO, 25-CuO, 35-CuO and 40-CuO catalysts are shown in Fig. S1. For all the reduced catalyst (except 2-CuO), it is shown that CuO (35.3° and 38.8°) and Cu° (43.3°) species are observed. Only a weak peak associated with Cu° species is observed over 2-CuO, and CuO species are not observed due to their low contents and/or high dispersion. Their crystallite size of the Cu phase was calculated from Scherrer’s equation. The crystalline sizes of 2-CuO, 25-CuO, 35-CuO and 40-CuO catalysts are 10.5, 22.4, 9.8 and 26.6 nm, respectively. The change trend in crystallinity of copper species of H2-reduced x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts (x = 2, 25, 35 and 40) is similar to the calcined samples. The 35-CuO shows the decrease of copper crystallinity and the high dispersion of the catalyst. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts and it is found that rod structure (Ce0.4Zr0.6O2) is gradually destroyed with the increase of CuO content, especially for 35-CuO sample, which arises from the increase in the number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution. The textural properties of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts are shown in Table 1. The BET surface area decreases with the increase of CuO loading from 2 to 25 wt.%. However, further increase of CuO loading to 35 wt.%, the BET surface area increases. This should be ascribed to the increasing number in the incorporation of Cu2+ into the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 lattice [26]. The BET surface area reduces progressively with further increasing CuO loading to 40 wt.%. This is because the massive formation of crystalline CuO, which is known to contribute very little to the total surface area. 35-CuO has the highest surface area 117.6 m2/g and pore volume 0.16 cm3/g. Additionally, the results of N2O chemisorption measurement show that the exposed Cu surface area (S Cu) of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst exhibits in a similar tendency (Table 1). It can be also found that S Cu of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts passes its maximum (64.7 m2 Cu/g, in 35-CuO) and then decreases with the increasing content of CuO (24.7 m2 Cu/g, in 40-CuO). Meanwhile, the Cu dispersion (D Cu, 9.5 %) of 35-CuO catalyst is higher than that of other samples. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts with different CuO loading. As shown in Fig. 3a, all the x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts show prominent broad peaks at around 465 and 631 cm−1 and a weak band at 296 cm−1. Among them, the band at 465 cm−1 is ascribed to the Raman active F2g mode of CeO2, and the bands at 631 and 296 cm−1 can be related with lattice defects, which results from the formation of oxygen vacancies [28]. And the ratio of the peak area at 632 and 463 cm−1 (A632 /A463) can be used to represent the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The calculation results (Fig. 3b) show that among all the x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts, the oxygen vacancies concentration in 35-CuO catalyst is the highest. This is because more copper species are readily to enter the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 solid solution [29]. It has been proven that the oxygen vacancy on the support is a crucial factor to affect the CuO dispersion [30], which is consistent with XRD, SEM and N2O chemisorption results. 3.2 Nature of copper species The EPR spectra of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 is presented in Fig. 4 . The spectra shows a line at g// = 1.954 and g⊥ = 1.937, which has been assigned to Ce3+ ions. It also exhibits a strong resonance line at g// = 2.021 and g⊥ = 2.011, which is attributed to O2− species bound to Ce4+ ions. The additional signal at g = 2.037, which is probably due to the presence of oxygen vacancies [31]. After the addition of copper species, the resonance line intensities of either Ce3+ or oxygen vacancies are decreasing with an increase of CuO loading. What’s more, two types of paramagnetic Cu2+ can be identified in the EPR spectrum. The four-line hyperfine splittings indicate that the existence of isolated Cu2+ ions on the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 surface [32]. When the CuO content increases, a poorly resolved hyperfine structure is observed and the signal intensities of the EPR spectra significantly decrease. The species characterized by a broad isotropic signal are attributed to dipolar, interacting Cu2+ ions ((Cu-O-Cu)2+ clusters), which are centered at average g = 2.122 [33]. In particular, the EPR parameter value of interacting Cu2+ ions over 35-CuO is different from others. This is because a larger number of copper species insert into Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 lattice [34]. With the further increase in the CuO loading from 15 to 35 wt.%, the number of (Cu-O-Cu)2+ clusters grows and then declines for 40-CuO. Above all, at low CuO loading (2 and 5 wt.%), CuO is highly dispersed and isolated. At high CuO loading (from 15 to 35 wt.%), the number of (Cu-O-Cu)2+ clusters grows. However, CuO content reaches 40 wt.%, the amount of both species (isolated Cu2+ and interacting Cu2+) decrease significantly, because CuO species are likely to aggregates into crystal particles that do not show EPR signal. The reduction characteristics of the catalyst with different CuO loading are depicted in Fig. 5 . For all the samples the ratio between the amount of H2 consumed and the amount of reducible copper oxide in the temperature range 200–400 °C is lower (0.57−0.99) than that expected on the basis of stoichiometry (H2/Cu = 1.00), indicating that CuO is not fully reduced during the reduction process. When the CuO loading is above 15 %, the reduction temperature peaks of samples are categorized into three species, α peak is associated with Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution [34,35], β peak is attributed to small crystallite size of CuO species. The γ peak is from the reduction of large crystallite size of CuO species. The highest ratio α /(α+β+γ) is detected on 35-CuO (31.4 %), which indicates that it has the largest number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution. Differently, there are only two kinds of CuO species (small and large crystallite size of CuO), namely β and γ at low CuO loading (2-CuO and 5-CuO), no Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution is observed on both species. This conclusion is consistent with XRD results. For the 2-CuO and 5-CuO catalysts, as is illustrated in EPR results, CuO exists as isolated Cu2+ species, which strongly interacts with the support. For the 15-CuO, 25-CuO and 35-CuO catalysts, (Cu-O-Cu)2+ clusters are the main species but with a weaker interaction with the support, which promotes the reduction of CuO species [36]. Hence, the reduction temperature shifts to lower from 2-CuO to 15-CuO. However, when CuO content is greater than or equal to 25 wt.%, the crystalline CuO species begin to grow significantly, thus requiring higher reduction temperature. 3.3 Adsorption behavior Fig. 6 a displays the CO2-TPD profiles of H2-reduced x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts. The CO2 desorption peaks can be divided into three kinds clearly, denoted as α, β and γ, respectively. Peaks located at the low temperature ranging from 50 °C–150 °C, is ascribed to weakly adsorbed carbon species on weak base sites. These weak base sites are assigned to the surface hydroxyl groups on metal oxides [7]. The moderately basic sites at temperature from 150 °C to 300 °C are attributed to the metal-oxygen pairs, and the CO2 desorption at high temperature (around 375 °C) corresponds to the strongly basic sites, such as coordinatively unsaturated O2 − ions [7]. In addition, with increasing CuO loading from 2 to 35 wt.%, both the concentration of moderately and strongly basic sites increase. However, these two basic sites concentration decrease when CuO content reaches 40 wt.%. It has demonstrated that the strength of two basic sites is closely related with methanol selectivity [37]. Hence, it is speculated that 35-CuO with the highest basic strength will show the best methanol selectivity. Fig. 6b shows the H2-TPD profiles of the H2-reduced x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts. The H2-TPD profiles of all tested samples are categorized into two groups, namely, the relatively lower temperature desorption (<500 °C) and higher temperature desorption (>600 °C). The first desorption peaks (<500 °C) are attributable to the desorption of atomic hydrogen bound to surface Cu sites [38]. And the desorption temperature of 35-CuO is the lowest, indicating that it is much easier to adsorb and activate H2. High temperature desorption peaks (>600 °C), which are attributable to H2 desorption spillover from Cu site, are also observed in all the tested catalysts [38]. Furthermore, the high temperature desorption peaks can be divided into two parts, the former one (α) is assigned to H2 desorption from dispersed Cu site and the latter one (β) is attributable to H2 desorption from bulk Cu [39]. Among all, 35-CuO presents the most intense desorption peak arising from dispersed Cu site at high temperature and its desorption rate is higher than other samples. In summary, 35-CuO exhibits the highest H2 adsorption capacity compared with other samples. 3.4 Catalytic performance The results shown in Fig. 7 a display that CO2 conversion increases with the increasing of CuO loading until it reaches a maximum value at 35 wt.%, however, further addition of CuO (40-CuO) inhibits conversion of CO2. The order of CO2 conversion is 35-CuO > 25-CuO > 40-CuO > 15-CuO > 5-CuO > 2-CuO under all reaction temperatures. This result can be explained via a good amount of the 35-CuO catalyst, which it also has relatively high S Cu and D Cu. Formation of the larger and less dispersed particles can be responsible for declining of the catalytic activity at 40 wt.% CuO loading. Hence, the conclusion is that both a balanced amount of CuO species and its excellent properties (S Cu and D Cu) contributes to improve CO2 conversion. Similarly, methanol selectivity gradually increases with the increase of CuO content and the best methanol selectivity is obtained over 35-CuO catalyst (Fig. 7b). However, when the CuO content is increased to 40.wt%, the additional amount of CuO leads to a decline in the methanol selectivity. The order of methanol selectivity is 35-CuO (96.4 %) > 25-CuO (75.9 %) > 15-CuO (72.6 %) ≈ 40-CuO (71.8 %) > 5-CuO (60.5 %) > 2-CuO (13.2 %) at 220 °C. This trend is also suitable for higher reaction temperature, the order of methanol selectivity is 35-CuO (71.8 %) > 25-CuO (32.8 %) > 15-CuO (22.1 %) ≈ 40-CuO (20.8 %) > 5-CuO (14.8 %) > 2-CuO (10.7 %) at 280 °C. The methanol selectivity of all samples at 280 °C is lower than those of at 220 °C due to the presence of reverse water gas reaction (RWGS) [40]. It has presented that 35-CuO has the larger amount of moderately and strongly basic sites due to the formation of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution (Fig. 6), which is beneficial to improve methanol selectivity. Hence, it is inferred that 35-CuO with the largest number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution shows the highest methanol selectivity at both 220 °C and 280 °C. CO is the major by-product observed in our study. It is shown that CO formation are enhanced over x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts at higher temperature (Fig. 7c), as well as the 35-CuO catalyst is beneficial to hinder the formation of CO, therefore selectivity to methanol is favored. The 35-CuO catalyst shows the best catalytic performance (X CO2 = 13.2 %, S CH3OH = 71.8 %, Y CH3OH = 9.47 %) at 280 °C and 3 MPa. As is shown in Table 2 , compared with ZnO-ZrO2 catalyst, 35-CuO shows similar CO2 conversion with a slightly lower methanol selectivity. But 35-CuO catalyst has an advantage in methanol selectivity compared with copper-based and noble metal catalysts under similar reaction conditions (reaction temperature and pressure). Additionally, it is obvious that the 35-CuO catalyst exhibits a stable catalytic performance for 96 h test period (Fig. S2). The effect of the conversion of CO2 on the selectivity toward methanol is shown in Fig. 8 . As a general observation, the selectivity to methanol tends to decrease as conversion increases. The selectivity is favored when the temperature is lower due to a decrease in the rate of CO formation. When comparing at constant conversion, the selectivity to methanol presents significant differences among the catalysts. Higher selectivity is developed by the catalysts with 35 wt.% Cu loading. Comparing at the same conversion, for example, at 280 °C when CO2 conversion is 9% (Fig. 8a), 35-CuO present a methanol selectivity of 100 %, whereas the selectivity to methanol on 2-CuO, 25-CuO and 40-CuO decreases is 5.6 %, 34.1 % and 21.6 %, respectively. At 220 °C (Fig. 8b), the conversion of CO2 is lower than 5% over all catalysts, and the selectivity can attain value of 100 % in the case of 35-CuO catalyst. 3.5 Structure-activity relationship Above all, higher copper content can provide sufficient active sites, however, 40-CuO does not present the optimal catalytic performance due to the agglomeration of CuO species. And the lower copper content catalysts (2-CuO and 5-CuO) display poor activity due to the insufficient active metal sites despite their higher S Cu and D Cu. In our work, Cu° species on the H2-reduced 35-CuO catalyst are regarded as the main catalytic active centers on the basis of XRD, Raman and XPS results (Fig. S3-S5), which are used to provide activated hydrogen atom for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol [46]. As is shown by the results of H2-TPD (Fig. 6), all the x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts show the hydrogen adsorption ability. However, the rate of hydrogen atom exchange is much more rapid on 35-CuO than other samples. This effect is attributed to the higher effectiveness of Cu to dissociate H2. The rate of hydrogen supply exhibits an important effect on the overall reaction rate [38]. The dynamics of hydrogen atom exchange on the surface of x wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 is found to depend on the nature of active sites including the number of Cu species and S Cu [39]. The hydrogen could be activated more efficiently over 35-CuO with an appropriate amount of Cu species and higher S Cu. Thus, it can be attributed to the low activation barrier for H2 dissociation on the Cu species of 35-CuO. Consequently, more atomic hydrogen can be obtained for the hydrogenation of the adsorbed carbon containing species. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Cu2+ is partially incorporated into the Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 lattice, forming Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution, which induces the tetrahedral distortion of Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 solid solution structure, thus the oxygen vacancies are formed more easily [47]. The formation of oxygen vacancies enables the interaction of the catalyst with CO2, and promotes the CO2 hydrogenation [48]. And the formation of a larger number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution leads to form the stronger synergy interaction between Cu and Ce0.4Zr0.6O2. And the interaction effect hinders the crystallization of catalyst components and the growth of crystal grain, which can effectively activate and stabilize the copper species during the reaction [39]. Hence, the role of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution in CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH over CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 is revealed. Firstly, the Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution is effective to activate CO2 due to the presence of a larger number of oxygen vacancies. Secondly, Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution is beneficial to suppress copper sintering, due to the formation of stronger interaction effect. In summary, the appropriate amount of CuO content and higher S Cu and D Cu are favorable for the hydrogenation of CO2 by providing more activated hydrogen atom. Additionally, a larger number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution is effective to improve the adsorption and activation of CO2. Therefore, 35-CuO catalyst is favorable for methanol production. 3.6 In situ DRIFTS measurements In situ DRIFTS experiments are performed to identify the key intermediates and their hydrogenation rate during CO2 hydrogenation over four representative catalysts, these are 2-CuO, 25-CuO, 35-CuO and 40-CuO. Fig. 9 a-d show the evolution of the principal surface intermediate species on four samples during CO2 hydrogenation reaction at 3 MPa and 280 °C. The assignments of vibrational features are listed in Table 3 . Similarly, the common bands at 1371, 1405 and 1583 cm−1 are identified as bidentate formate species (bi−HCOO*) [49], while 1295 and 1567 cm−1 are regarded as monodentate formate species (m−HCOO*) [50]. The peaks at 1045 and 1471 cm−1 are attributed to the H3CO* species [51]. Differently, except 35-CuO sample, the bicarbonate or/and carbonate species can be detected on the other three samples, 1359 and 1548 cm−1 (CO3 2−) for 2-CuO, 1268 cm−1 (HCO3 −) as well as 1338 cm−1 (CO3 2−) for 25-CuO and 40-CuO. And the bicarbonate or/and carbonate species keep growing on these three samples during the CO2 hydrogenation process, demonstrating that the hydrogenation rate of bicarbonate/carbonate species on 2-CuO, 25-CuO and 40-CuO are slower than their formation rate. These results indicate that atomic hydrogen is insufficient during the hydrogenation process on three samples. On the contrary, not only do the bicarbonate/carbonate species not form on 35-CuO but also there are more types of H-containing intermediate species bi−HCOO* (2713 and 2804 cm−1) and H3CO* (1143 and 2921 cm−1) form, which indicates that the hydrogenation rate of 35-CuO is much higher than those of other samples. Therefore, 35-CuO shows the best CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity. As is shown in Fig. 9a, the concentration of intermediate species on 2-CuO is relatively low at the initial stage of the reaction, and the growth is extremely slow as the reaction proceeds. Thus, methanol production (2842 cm−1) is in a small amount through the whole process. The initial concentrations of intermediate species on 25-CuO (Fig. 9b) and 40-CuO (Fig. 9d) are very high, however, the growth rate is also quite low. For the 35-CuO, though it has relatively low starting concentration of intermediate species, the growth rate is very fast. The amount of methanol also increases significantly from 5 min to 60 min. Thus, 35-CuO has a higher concentration of intermediate species compared with other samples at 60 min, indicating that 35-CuO is more effective than other samples in CO2 activation and CH3OH formation [52]. The DRIFT spectra between 1800 and 2100 cm−1 is assigned to chemisorbed carbonyls on the surface of catalysts. And the adsorbed CO species (2076 cm−1) and linear CO species (2094 cm−1) are observed on 25-CuO and 40-CuO catalysts [53]. The amount of CO is not changed when the reaction starts from 5 min to 60 min. For the 2-CuO and 35-CuO catalysts, only gaseous CO band (2136 cm−1) is observed [54], and it appears from 10 min for 2-CuO and 25 min for 35-CuO. The adsorbed CO species on 25-CuO and 40-CuO catalysts will occupy the adsorption site of the reaction intermediate species, however, gaseous CO species on 2-CuO and 35-CuO catalysts can remove from the catalyst surface easily and quickly [55]. As is shown in Fig. 7c, 2-CuO and 35-CuO catalysts show lower CO selectivity than 25-CuO and 45-CuO.Meanwhile, the growth rate of gaseous CO on 35-CuO catalyst is much slower than that of 2-CuO catalyst. Hence, 35-CuO catalyst shows the lowest CO selectivity (20.3 % at 280 °C and 3 MPa). By investigating the evolution of the intermediate species using high pressure in situ DRIFTS, the following reaction pathway over CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst is proposed: Firstly, the H2 molecular is adsorbed on the Cu surface and dissociated into H atoms. Secondly, the formation of carbonates/bicarbonates is observed after CO2 adsorption on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 surface, then these adsorption species are hydrogenated by H2 spillover from Cu sites successively to bi/m−HCOO*, and H3CO* species, finally to target product methanol. The primary role of Cu0 is to provide a source of atomic H* for the hydrogenation of carbon-containing species by spillover effect. In detail, the production of atomic H* includes two procedures. First, the molecular H2 is adsorbed over the Cu0 active site, and then the adsorbed molecular H2 dissociates to give atomic H*. With regard to the adsorption and dissociation of H2 molecule, it relates to the amount and nature of CuO species (S Cu, D Cu). The increase in the amount of H2 desorption can be ascribed to the increasing amount of Cu active sites introduced by the higher CuO content (Fig. 6b). The large S Cu and D Cu are benefit to promote dissociation rate of H2 molecule [56], which leads to higher CO2 conversion. Additionally, the increase in the number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution, promoting the generation of oxygen vacancies, which results in a increase in methanol selectivity [43]. Therefore, 35-CuO has a stronger ability to dissociate H2 and the availability of the activated H2 as well as CO2 compared with other samples, resulting in better catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. 4 Conclusions A series of CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalysts with 2, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 40 wt.% of CuO content are synthesized using oxalate co-precipitation method. This study reports the effect of CuO content on the structural properties and catalytic performance of CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst in methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Both structural properties and activity profiles of catalysts are significantly affected by variation of CuO content. Activity data confirms that 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst is the most efficient catalyst in terms of CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity. This is because the 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst combines the advantages of both the higher number of active H atom (sufficient number of copper species with high copper surface area) and the stronger CO2 adsorption and activation capacity (a large number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution).

Catalytic activity results demonstrate that CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity enhance with an increase of the CuO loading until it reaches the maximum values at a CuO loading of 35 wt.%, while further addition of CuO inhibits the catalytic performance. The higher CO2 conversion of 7.0 % (13.2 %) and methanol selectivity of 96.4 % (71.8 %) are obtained over 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst at 220 °C (280 °C) and 3 MPa. The excellent performance of 35 wt.% CuO/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 is attributed to the presence of adequate copper species with higher copper surface area and larger number of Cu-Ce-Zr solid solution. These two features are benefit to provide larger number of activated hydrogen atom and promote CO2 adsorption, respectively, which are the key to the hydrogenation reaction related to the hydrogen dissociation and the activation of the carbon dioxide.",
