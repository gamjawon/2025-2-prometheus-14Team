Nitrate electroreduction to ammonia (NO3ER) holds great promise for producing valuable ammonia and simultaneously solving the nitrate-based environmental concerns, in which searching for highly-efficient catalysts is a crucial issue. Herein, by means of extensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the potential of a series of Cu-based DACs anchored on two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer with boron vacancy (CuM/BN) as the NO3ER catalysts. Our results revealed that CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN exhibit superior catalytic performance for NO3ER due to their small limiting potentials (-0.27 and -0.32 V) based on a six-step screening strategy. Remarkably, their high NO3ER catalytic activity mainly originates from their optimal binding strength with NO3* intermediate due to their moderate positive charges on the active sites. Our findings not only suggested highly efficient catalysts for advancing sustainable NH3 synthesis, but also proposed a feasible strategy for rapidly screening eligible NO3ER catalysts. Graphic abstract Image, graphical abstract Through a six-step screening approach based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, the heteronuclear diatomic CuMn/BN system was identified as a suitable catalyst for NH3 production to promote sustainable nitrate degradation and ammonia synthesis.

At present, industrial NH3 synthesis still relies on the energy intensive Haber-Bosch process, which derives from the reaction between nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) at high temperatures and high pressures [3,4]. As an alternative, the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has recently attracted tremendous research interest due to its high efficiency, low cost, and environmental friendliness [5,6]. Although some efforts have been made on NRR [7,8], the low selectivity and sluggish reaction kinetics due to the extremely low solubility and the rather inert bond of N2 greatly hamper its practical applications. Thus, the further development of nitrogen-containing alternatives is of great significance for boosting the sustainable NH3 synthesis. Interestingly, thanks to its much lower dissociation energy of N = O bond (204 kJ mol−1) than that of NN one (941 kJ mol−1) in N2 molecule and the higher solubility in water, the nitrate (NO3 −) was recently regarded as a promising nitrogen source for large-scale NH3 electrosynthesis [9,10]. Especially, the excessive use of fertilizes and the unrestrained anthropogenic activities makes increasing level of NO3 − be discharged into the surface water and underground aquifer, thus posing a great threat to human health and ecological environments [11]. In this regards, NO3 − electroreduction reaction (NO3ER) to NH3 at ambient conditions can be regarded as a “two birds-one stone” strategy to simultaneously solve the plight of energy and environment by “turning waste into wealth” [12,13]. However, NO3ER involves nine protons and eight electrons (NO3 − + 9H+ + 8e− → NH3 + 3H2O), in which the formation of many undesired byproducts (such as NO, NO2, N2, and N2O) and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) greatly reduces its Faradaic efficiency and the yield rate of NH3 [14,15]. Thus, it is highly desirable to search for promising NO3ER electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for NH3 synthesis. So far, the noble transition metals, such as Pt, Ru, and Pd, were found to exhibit excellent catalytic performance for NO3ER [16–18], but their scarcity and high cost greatly limited their practical applications. Owing to the 100% atom utilization efficiency and excellent catalytic activity, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been growing as the hot topic in electrocatalysis [19–21]. Nevertheless, a solo active site makes SACs suffer from structural simplicity, lack of synergistic active sites, and the scaling relationship limit between the adsorption energies of intermediates, which would induce the intrinsic limitation of catalytic activity on SACs, especially for most multi-step reactions [22–24]. Interestingly, in recent years, dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with atomic-scaled homonuclear or heteronuclear sites have been applied in various electrocatalytic reactions and exhibit outstanding catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms [25–27]. Especially, compared with SACs, the electronic properties of the catalytic sites within DACs can be well regulated by the coupled metal centers, enabling them a higher catalytic activity than the homologous SACs [28], while still maintaining the huge advantages of SACs, such as 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Thus, some promising DACs catalysts have been proposed experimentally or theoretically in electrocatalysis [29–33]. For example, Wang et al. designed an electrocatalyst with Fe-Co dual sites embedded in N-doped porous carbon, which exhibited higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction than commercial Pt/C catalysts [29]. Li et al. reported the Ag2/graphene catalyst featuring AgN3-AgN3 active site for CO2 reduction [30]. Inspired by the unique structures and excellent activity, in this work, we designed a class of Cu-based heteronuclear DACs anchored on the defective boron nitride (BN) monolayer with B vacancy (CuM/BN) as NO3ER electrocatalysts. Notably, Cu-based materials were recently showed to be one of the most promising electrocatalysts for NO3ER due to their low cost and high activity [34–36]. On the other hand, as an analogue of graphene, BN nanosheet exhibits better oxidation resistance and excellent physical and chemical inertness, which makes it show many potential applications in various fields [37]. However, the pristine BN nanosheet is inert for anchoring metal particles due to their aggregation, leading to the catalyst deactivation [38]. Interestingly, the properties of BN can be modulated by creating defects, such as the B or N vacancy as well as Stone-Wales defect [39], which can be created by electron beam irradiation, solvent exfoliation, and ball milling methods [40]. Among them, B vacancy was found to be preferably formed in experiments than N vacancy and Stone-Wales defect, whereas divacancy (VBN) formation could be not stable, as it could transform to larger hole according to previous study [41]. More interestingly, several studies have successfully utilized BN nanosheet with B vacancy as the promising substrate for metal particles [42–45]. For example, Li et al. fabricated the atomically dispersed palladium atoms anchored on BN nanosheet with B vacancy using a low-temperature synthetic strategy, which presented high efficiency towards chemoselective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [42]. Thus, inspired by its great promise in catalysis, the experimentally available BN nanosheet with B vacancy was chosen as the support for immobilizing these Cu-based DACs in this work. By means of a six-step screening method based on the high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) computations, we found that the CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN systems can be utilized as the eligible catalysts for NO3ER with low limiting potentials (−0.27 and −0.32 V). Remarkably, we found that the active sites in the CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN catalysts display moderate positive charges, endowing them optimal binding strength with NO3* species and thus resulting in their superior NO3ER catalytic performance. Our results not only suggest the low–cost and highly efficient catalysts for NO3ER under ambient conditions, but also offer a new strategy to rapidly screen promising NO3ER electrocatalysts, which could inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to explore catalysts with multiple active sites for NO3ER. 2 Computational methods Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed by using Vienna ab initio software package (VASP) [46,47]. The projected augmented wave (PAW) method was adopted to describe the ion-electrons [48,49]. The exchange correlation energy was treated by the generalized gradient approximation in the form of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [50] and a cutoff energy of 550 eV for plane-wave basis set was used. The van der Waals (vdW) correction was described using Grimme's scheme (DFT+D3) [51]. The convergence criteria for force and the energy were set to 0.03 eV/Å and 10−5 eV, respectively, during the structure relaxation. A supercell consisting of 5 × 5 × 1 BN monolayer with B monovacancy was used as the substrate to immobilize these DACs (Fig. 1 and Table S1) and the k-point in the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid. To avoid the interaction between adjacent periodic images, a vacuum space of 20 Å was employed. The involved transition states were located by the climbing image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method [52]. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations [53] were performed to assess the thermodynamic stability of materials. The widely-accepted computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model [54,55] was employed to obtain the free energy diagrams and the corresponding limiting potentials of the NO3ER process, and more computational details were further summarized in the electronic supporting information (ESI). It was noted that the effect of solvation was not considered in this work, as our test indicated that the limiting potential for NO3ER is quite small (within 0.10 eV, Fig. S1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening DACs As above mentioned, the NO3ER is a rather complicated multi-electron-transfer process, and many N-containing intermediates from +5 to −3 valence states are involved. Thus, the catalytic activity of NO3ER on a given catalyst was determined by eight electrochemical steps, rather than a special elementary reaction. Furthermore, NO3 − reactant can be adsorbed on catalyst surface via different possible patterns, leading to different reaction pathways. For example, in the NO3ER process, the conversion from NO* to NH3 product still remains highly controversial: Clayborne et al. proposed that NH3 can be generated via NOH* species [56], while Koper's group suggested that HNO* species is a crucial reaction intermediate [57]. Especially, to fully address the activity for NO3ER, at least 20 reaction intermediates should be considered, which inevitably consume huge computational resources. Therefore, the development of an efficient strategy is very essential to rapidly screen promising NO3ER catalysts with high-efficiency and selectivity. To this end, we proposed a six-step strategy to estimate the potential of DACs as NO3ER catalysts for NH3 synthesis (Fig. 2 a): 1) NO3 − species should be chemisorbed on catalyst with a negative free energy change (ΔGNO3* < 0 eV) to ensure its sufficient activation, which is a prerequisite to promote the subsequent reduction reactions; 2) recent studies showed that, on some catalysts containing multiple active sites, the hydrogenation of OH* species to H2O is the final step of NO3ER [58]. Nevertheless, this reaction of OH* → H2O on most of catalysts needs a rather high energy input, greatly hindering the recovery of catalysts for the next cycle. Thus, to guarantee the low energy cost, the ΔG for OH* → H2O should be as low as possible; 3), 4), and 5) as the hydrogenation of some nitric oxides (such as NO3*, NO2*, and NO*) or nitrogen molecule, is usually the most likely potential-determining steps (PDS) in NO3ER [59] and nitrogen reduction [60,61], these steps should exhibit as small as possible ΔG values. To achieve promising NO3ER catalysts, the ΔG values for the hydrogenation of OH*, NO3*, NO2*, and NO* species were set to be smaller than 0.53 eV, which is comparable or smaller than those of some well-established NO3ER catalysts according to our summary in Table S2; 6) to ensure the high selectivity of NO3ER, the difference between the limiting potentials for NO3ER and the competing hydrogen evolution (HER) should be less negative than −0.50 V, consistent with previous reports [62]. Following this six-step screening strategy, the whole NO3ER process on these CuM/BN candidates will be further explored to achieve the excellent catalysts for NO3ER. Following criterion 1, we first studied the adsorption of NO3 − on these CuM/BN materials, in which two possible initial configurations were considered on Cu and M active sites, including 1-O and 2-O patterns, in which one and two O atoms were adsorbed on Cu or its adjacent metal atoms (Fig. S2). After fully structural relaxation, we found that NO3 − is preferable to be adsorbed on CuM/BN catalysts via the 2-O pattern. Notably, on most of CuM/BN catalysts, the M atoms are identified as the active sites for NO3 − adsorption due to their larger positive charges than Cu sites (Table S1), whereas the Cu atoms in CuCu, CuAg, and CuAu catalysts carry larger positive charges than their neighboring metal atoms, thus performing as the active sites for the adsorbed NO3* species. We then computed the corresponding ΔGNO3* values as follows: ΔG NO3* = G NO3* − G* − G HNO3(g) + 1/2G H2(g) + ΔG correct, where G NO3*, G *, G HNO3(g), and G H2(g) represent the Gibbs free energies of the adsorbed NO3* species, pristine catalysts, free HNO3, and H2 molecules in the gas phase, respectively. ΔG correct is the correction of free adsorption energy, which was set as 0.39 eV according to previous theoretical studies [63]. The results showed that NO3 − species exhibits a negative ΔG NO3* value on most of Cu/BN systems with ranging from –0.04 to –2.17 eV, while the ΔG NO3* values on CuCo, CuNi, CuCu, CuRh, CuAg, CuPd, and CuAu catalysts are positive (Fig. 2a), indicative of their rather weak reactivity for NO3 − adsorption. According to the criterion 1, the seven CuM-based catalysts are thus excluded. Based on the first-step screening with ΔG NO3*, the free energy changes for OH* + H+ + e− → H2O were computed and presented in Fig. 2c. The results showed that only CuMn, CuFe, CuIr, and CuPt catalysts stratify criterion 2 due to their less negative ΔG values than 0.53 eV for OH* desorption, which are thus preserved as the promising NO3ER catalysts. Next, we computed the ΔG values for the hydrogenation of the NO3*, NO2*, and NO* species on CuMn, CuFe, CuIr, and CuPt systems. Unfortunately, the reaction of NO* + H+ + e− → HNO* on CuPt catalyst requires an energy input of 0.75 eV, which is larger than that of the proposed screening criterion 2 of 0.53 eV. Thus, CuPt system is screened out in the further discussions. Finally, we evaluated the NO3ER selectivity by comparing the adsorption energies of NO3 − (ΔG NO3*) and H proton (ΔG H*). The results that the ΔG NO3* values are more negative than ΔG H* on CuMn, CuFe, and CuIr systems (Fig. S3), indicating that NO3* adsorption dominates on the three catalysts over H adsorption. We also computed the limiting potential difference (∆UL = UL NO3ER -UL HER) on the three catalysts, where a less negative ∆UL corresponds to a higher selectivity towards NO3ER. Significantly, the computed ∆UL values for CuMn and CuFe catalysts are 0.25 and −0.07 V, which are much less negative than that of metal-based benchmark (−0.50 V), suggesting their overwhelming suppressing effects on the HER. On the contrary, CuIr system has a more negative ∆UL of −0.75 V, indicating its poor NO3ER selectivity. Thus, based on the aforementioned screening, only CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN materials satisfy all six criteria, and are therefore chosen as the ideal NO3ER electrocatalysts for NH3 synthesis. 3.2 NO3ER performance of CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN catalysts As CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN materials have been screened as promising catalyst candidates, we then studied the full NO3 − electroreduction paths to form NH3 product on the two catalysts to determine the PDS and the corresponding limiting potential. Based on the involved reaction pathways (Fig. 3 ), we then computed the ∆G values of all possible elementary steps in the whole NO3ER. The free energy profile was presented in Fig. 4 a, while the corresponding reaction intermediates were summarized in Fig. S4, where CuMn was taken as a representative for simplicity. The thermodynamic results showed that the NO3ER process prefers to take place along the following pathway (Fig. 4a): NO3 − is first chemisorbed the Mn site by forming two Mn-O bonds with the ΔG value of −0.04 eV. Subsequently, the adsorbed NO3* will be hydrogenated to generate NO3H* on Mn active site by reacting with a (H + + e− ) pair. Interestingly, the formed NO3H* species is favorable to dissociate into NO2* (on Mn site) and OH* species (on Cu site) with a rather low barrier of 0.09 eV, which is different from that of on the well-identified SACs surfaces [64]. Such difference may be expected, because two adjacent active sites on DACs surfaces are available to accommodate the dissociated NO2* and OH species, whereas there is no extra active site on SACs to adsorb the dissociated intermediates. Notably, this reaction of NO3* + H+ + e− → NO2* + OH* is highly exothermic by −1.33 eV in the free energy profile. Next, a second (H + + e− ) is preferable to attack OH* to generate (NO2* + H2O) with the ΔG value of −0.26 eV, rather than NO2* to form (NO2H* + OH*, ΔG = 0.03 eV). Once the formed H2O is released from the surface of CuMn/BN catalyst, the remaining NO2* species, bound to Mn site with the Mn–N length of 2.52 Å, can react with another (H + + e− ) to generate a NO2H* group. Remarkably, this hydrogenation step is downhill by 0.27 eV. Furthermore, the attacking of a fourth (H + + e− ) pair induces the dissociation of NO2H* into NO* and H2O, which is highly exothermic by −1.26 eV. Next, NO* is more energetically favorable to be hydrogenated to HNO* and H2NO* with the ΔG values of −0.27 and −0.03 eV. Interestingly, the N atom in the H2NO* species is more likely to be attacked by the (H + + e− ) pair, releasing the final NH3 product. Remarkably, this step is downhill in the free energy profile by −2.19 eV, which is much larger than that of the formation of the H2NOH* species (−0.13 eV, Table S3). Finally, the remaining O atom on Mn active site with a length of 1.60 Å is hydrogenated to OH* and H2O with the ΔG values of 0.21 and −0.32 eV, respectively, completing the whole NO3ER cycle. Overall, the most favorable pathway for NO3ER to NH3 on CuMn/BN can be summarized as follows: NO3 − → NO3* → NO3H* → NO2* → NO2H* → NO* → HNO* → H2NO* → NH3 + O* → OH* → H2O. According to the computed ΔG values of all elementary steps in NO3ER, the hydrogenation of NO2* to form NO2H* is identified as the PDS on CuMn/BN catalyst due to its maximum ΔG value of 0.27 eV, corresponding to the limiting potential of −0.27 V. It is noteworthy that similar reaction pathway has been observed for NO3ER on CuFe/BN catalyst (Fig. 4b), while its PDS is the formation of HNO* from NO* with the limiting potential of −0.32 V. Excitingly, the limiting potentials for NO3ER on two catalysts (−0.27 and −0.32 V) are less negative than those of many reported SACs (−0.34 V ∼ −0.53 V, Table S2), suggesting their superior catalytic activity towards NO3ER. On the other hand, we also examined the selectivity of CuMn/BN catalyst towards other N-containing byproducts, including NO2, NO, N2O, and N2. The results showed that, due to the high reactivity of CuMn/BN, the release of NO2 and NO has to overcome an ultra-high energy input of 1.09 and 0.81 eV, respectively (Fig. 4), suggesting the infeasibility to generate the two byproducts. Regarding the formation of N2 and N2O byproducts, N2O2* is revealed to be a key intermediate, which can be yielded by the couple of two NO* species. Remarkably, this process of NO* + NO → N2O2* is slightly endothermic by 0.06 eV, whereas the formation of the aforementioned HNO* is exothermic by 0.27 eV. In addition, it is noteworthy that a kinetic barrier of 1.18 eV needs to be overcome for the non-electrochemical N2O2 formation, which is much smaller than that of NO* hydrogenation to HNO* (0.36 eV, Fig. S5). Overall, CuMn/BN exhibits outstanding selectivity towards NH3 synthesis by suppressing the corresponding byproducts thermodynamically and kinetically. 3.3 NO3ER activity origin on CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN catalysts According to a summary of previous theoretical studies [65,66], the adsorption of NO3 − species was regarded as the most crucial step to determine the NO3ER activity on various catalysts. As proposed by the Sabatier principle [67], an optimal catalyst should exhibit moderate adsorption strength with reactants. Interestingly, as above discussed, CuMn/BN catalyst has the least negative ∆G value (−0.04 eV) among all considered candidates, which is well consistent with its highest NO3ER catalytic activity. In contrast, either too strong (such as CuTa with ∆G of −2.17 eV) or too weak (such as CuCu with ∆G of 0.64 eV) leads to poor catalytic performance due to their inefficiency for OH* desorption (∆G = 2.51 eV) or NO3* activation (∆G = 0.04 eV). Thus, unraveling the remarkable difference of NO3 − adsorption on these CuM/BN catalysts is of great significance to gain an in-deep insight into their activity origin in NO3ER. To this end, we examined the charges on the active sites of CuM/BN materials. Understandably, due to the strong adsorption of CuM on defective BN monolayer, significant charges are transferred from CuM atoms to BN-based substrate. As a result, the Cu and its adjacent M atoms carry considerable positive charges (0.83∼1.83 |e −|) based on the Bader charge analysis, which is in good agreement with the computed differential charge densities (Fig. S6). Interestingly, an obvious linear scaling relationship can be established between the charges of the active sites and the binding strength of NO3* (Fig. 5 a). For example, the most negative ΔG NO3* on CuTa catalysts mainly originates from the largest charge on the Ta active sites (1.75 |e −|) among all candidates, whereas the small charge on the active Cu site in CuCu/BN results in its weak binding strength with NO3 − species. Furthermore, we also explored the partial density of states (PDOSs) and the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) of the formed M-O bonds by integrating the energy up to the Fermi level (Fig. S7), in which more negative ICOHP implies a stronger adsorption of NO3* on the active sites. Our results showed that NO3* adsorption on CuTa exhibits the most negative ICOHP value of −1.50 eV, again verifying its highest reactivity towards NO3* species. Especially, there is also a good linear relationship between ICOHP and ΔG NO3* (Fig. 5b), indicating that a more negative ICOHP value will induce stronger NO3* adsorption, among which CuMn system exhibits a moderate ICOHP, again verifying its highest NO3ER activity. In addition, we also computed the d-band centers (εd) to uncover the difference of NO3* adsorption on. Based on previous studies, a less negative εd value implies a more stronger interaction between NO3* and active sites. For example, CuTa/BN (strong ΔGNO3* of −2.17 eV), CuMn/BN (moderate ΔG*NO3 of −0.04 eV), and CuAg/BN (weak ΔG*NO3 of 0.62 eV) cases were chosen for comparison. The computed εd values of Ta, Mn, and Ag active sites are −0.06, −3.18, and −3.66 eV, respectively, which are well consistent with their corresponding binding strength with NO3* species. More importantly, a good linear relationship between εd andΔGNO3* (Fig. 5c). Thus, these linear correlations well account for the origin of the best catalytic activity of CuMn/BN material, because different active sites exhibit different positive charge, bonding/antibonding orbital populations, and d-band centers. Notably, one of the advantages of DACs is that it may break the scaling relationship limit between the adsorption energies of intermediates due to the synergistic active sites, as compared with SACs. To deeply understand the superior NO3ER catalytic activity of heteronuclear DACs, we analyzed the underlying electronic structures reflected by the projected density of states (PDOSs), in which CuFe and CuPt DACs were taken as the representatives because they have the same PDOSs, i.e. NO* → HNO*. The results showed that the NO* adsorption energy of CuPt is close to that of CuFe (the difference between each other is about 0.50 eV), but the adsorption energy of HNO* on the CuFe is more negative than that of the CuPt by about 1.20 eV, which is well consistent with their PDOSs: more apparent hybridization can be observed between N-2p and Fe-3d orbitals (Fig. 5d). The Cu and non-Cu active sites perform as the O* and N* binding sites for NO* and HNO* intermediates, respectively, breaking the scaling relationship between each other and thus improving the NO3ER catalytic activity. 3.4 Stability and electrical conductivity of CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN catalysts High stability is crucial for the practical applications of CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN as the NO3ER electrocatalysts. To this end, we examined the stability of the two promising catalysts. Undoubtedly, due to the presence of the unsaturated N atoms in defective BN substrate, CuMn and CuFe DACs prefer to be immobilized by the vacancy, resulting in two metal-N3 moieties, in which the anchored Cu, Mn, and Fe protrude out of the BN plane to different degrees. As expected, the binding energies of CuMn and CuFe DACs on this BN substrate are as high as −8.27 and −6.65 eV (Table S1), respectively, which are much larger than those of cohesive energies, indicative of the strong binding strength between each other. Moreover, since NO3ER usually proceed in aqueous conditions, we also estimated the electrochemical stability of the two catalysts by computing their corresponding dissolution potentials (Udiss, ESI). Here, a positive Udiss value suggests that the catalyst is stable from the electrochemical perspective as proposed by previous theoretical studies [68]. Fortunately, the Udiss values for CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN systems were computed to be as high as 1.22 and 1.55 V, respectively, indicating their high electrochemical stability against dissolution into reaction solutions. In addition, the thermodynamic stability of the two catalysts was further examined by performing AIMD simulations. Interestingly, we found that their structures remain very well at 500 K because there is still no obvious structural distortion (Fig. 6 ), indicative of their high thermodynamic stability. Thus, the high binding energy, excellent electrochemical and thermodynamic stability offer significant advantages for the experimental synthesis and realistic applications of CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN systems for NO3ER. Finally, excellent electrical conductivity is essential for the practical applications of a given catalyst in electrocatalysis, as it could boost rapid charge transfer during NO3ER. The pristine BN nanosheet is regarded as an insulator due to its wide band gap (4.71 eV). However after introducing B vacancy and DACs, the band gap of BN nanosheet is greatly reduced to 0.20 and 0.50 eV, respectively, for CuFe and CuMn (Fig. S8), thus enhancing its electrical conductivity. In particular, a graphene substrate was commonly used to further improve the electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Actually, the band gaps of CuFe/BN and CuMn/BN supported by graphene are decreased to 0.01 and 0.05 eV, suggesting their good electrical conductivity. 4 Conclusions In summary, we designed a class of DACs anchored on defective BN monolayer with superior catalytic performance for NO3 − electroreduction to synthesize NH3. The amount of the carrying positive charges of the active sites determines the adsorption strength of NO3 − species, which plays a key role in the catalytic performance of various Cu-based DACs. Through a six-step screening procedure, CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN materials were revealed to exhibit outstanding catalytic activity with small limiting potentials (−0.27 and −0.32 V) and high selectivity by greatly suppressing the competing side reactions. In addition, we showed that the as-designed CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN catalysts present high electrochemical and thermal stability, enabling them to hold great promising for experimental synthesis and practical applications. In terms of the small limiting potential, high selectivity, good stability, and great promise for synthesis, we predicted that CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN materials can be utilized as very compelling electrocatalyst for NH3 production from NO3ER, which may pave a new way for designing efficient electrocatalysts to advance the sustainable nitrate degradation and ammonia synthesis.

        "dc:description": "Nitrate electroreduction to ammonia (NO3ER) holds great promise for producing valuable ammonia and simultaneously solving the nitrate-based environmental concerns, in which searching for highly-efficient catalysts is a crucial issue. Herein, by means of extensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the potential of a series of Cu-based DACs anchored on two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer with boron vacancy (CuM/BN) as the NO3ER catalysts. Our results revealed that CuMn/BN and CuFe/BN exhibit superior catalytic performance for NO3ER due to their small limiting potentials (-0.27 and -0.32 V) based on a six-step screening strategy. Remarkably, their high NO3ER catalytic activity mainly originates from their optimal binding strength with NO3* intermediate due to their moderate positive charges on the active sites. Our findings not only suggested highly efficient catalysts for advancing sustainable NH3 synthesis, but also proposed a feasible strategy for rapidly screening eligible NO3ER catalysts.",
