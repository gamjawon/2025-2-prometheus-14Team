Effect of Morphology of the Ceria Support on the Activity of Au/CeO 2 Catalysts for CO Oxidation JIA Kunming, ZHANG Huili, LI Wencui* School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116012, Liaoning, China Abstract: Uniformly distributed crystalline nanorods, nanocubes, and nanopolyhedra of ceria were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Au colloid nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of these ceria to obtain Au/CeO 2 catalysts. Their catalytic activity for CO oxidation was evaluated, and the effect of the ceria morphology on the activity was investigated. As a support, nanorod (110+100) and nanopolyhedra (111+100) ceria exhibit higher activity than nanocube (100) ceria. At the lower temperature, Au/nanopolyhedra ceria exhibited better ac- tivity, while Au/nanorod ceria was the best catalyst at higher temperature. Key words: gold; carbon monoxide oxidation; ceria; crystal plane Fuel cells have been shown to be one of the most attractive energy source for electric vehicles. Unfortunately, small amounts of CO in the hydrogen fuel can poison the anode Pt catalyst, resulting in decreased performance of the fuel cell. It is therefore mandatory to remove trace CO from the H 2 fuel [1–4]. Ceria is widely used in CO oxidation catalysts because of its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), which is associated with its plentiful oxygen vacancies and low redox potential between Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ [5–7]. Supported Au/CeO 2 catalysts show very high low-temperature activity in pure CO oxidation and selective oxidation [8,9] and are promising for use in fuel cells. However, the origin of the activity, support effect, and CO oxidation mechanism of supported gold catalysts are still extensively debated in the literature. In the reaction mechanism, it has not yet been resolved if the reaction proceeds exclusively on metallic gold particles [10,11] or if it occurs preferentially at the edges of gold particle and involves either sites on the ad- jacent support or gold atoms influenced by the support [12]. It has been reported that the nature of the support material as well as the physical state of the support can influence the catalytic activity of the resulting gold catalysts [13–15]. Mai et al. [16] have synthesized CeO 2 with different morphologies by the hydrolysis of cerium (III) salts combined with a hydro- thermal treatment. Here, we present correlations of the activity with the morphology of nanoscale ceria as supports for gold catalysts for CO oxidation. The colloidal deposition method was selected to prepare the model catalysts as it allowed the isolation of the support effect on the catalytic activity and excluded the influence of gold particle formation by their deposition on the support [17]. The structures of CeO 2 before and after Au deposition were characterized by transmittance electron microscopy (TEM), N 2 adsorption, and X-ray diffrac- tion (XRD). 1 Experimental 1.1 Support preparation Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (AR grade, Tianjin Kermel Chem Reagent Co, China) was used as the cerium source. Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (0.868 g) was dissolved in 5 ml deionized water and mixed with 35 ml specific concentration NaOH solutions (C NaOH ) in a 80 ml Teflon bottle. The mixture was kept stirred for 30 min with the formation of a milky slurry. Subsequently, the Teflon bottle with this mixture was placed in a stainless steel autoclave, and the autoclave was sealed tightly. The autoclave was transferred into a temperature controlled electric oven for hydrothermal treatment at temperatures (T) in the range of 100–180 °C for 24 h. After the hydrothermal treatment, fresh JIA Kunming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(11): 1089–1092 white precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C in air overnight. The products after drying were yellow powders. The values of C NaOH and T were varied to get the target crystal shape (rods: C NaOH = 6 mol/L, T = 100 °C, t = 24 h; cubes: C NaOH = 6 mol/L, T = 180 °C, t = 24 h; polyhedra: C NaOH = 0.1 mol/L, T = 180 °C, t = 24 h). 1.2 Catalyst preparation The gold colloidal solutions were prepared using poly vinyl alcohol (PVA, M w = 10000 from Aldrich, 80% hydrolyzed) as the protecting agent. In a typical preparation, the protecting agent was added (mass ratio of Au/PVA = 1.5:1) to a 100 mg/L aqueous gold solution (as HAuCl 4 ) at room temperature under vigorous stirring. The solution was left with stirring for 10 min. A rapid injection of an aqueous solution of 0.25 mol/L NaBH 4 from Aldrich, 97% purity (molar ratio of Au/NaBH 4 = 1:5) led to the formation of a dark orange-brown solution, indicating the formation of the gold sol. The support was then added to the colloidal gold solution under stirring and kept until total ad- sorption (1 wt% of gold on the support) occurred, which was indicated by the decoloration of the solution. All the steps were carried out under the exclusion of light by covering all con- tainers with a layer of aluminum foil. The solids were collected by centrifugation followed by washing the solid with 2 L of doubly distilled water to remove all dissolved species (e.g. Na + , Cl – ). Finally, the solids were dried under a vacuum of 1 Pa in a desiccator with P 2 O 5 (as a drying agent) scattered on the bot- tom. 1.3 Catalyst characterization Powder XRD was performed on a Philips X’pert PRO X-ray diffractometer (Cu K . radiation, = 0.154178 nm). TEM analyses were carried out on a Tecnai G220 S-Twin equipment operated at 200 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were pre- pared by dipping carbon-coated copper grids into ethanol so- lutions of ceria nanoparticles and drying at room temperature. N 2 adsorption was performed at –196 °C using an ASAP 2020 apparatus (Micromeritics Instrument Co.). Samples of ap- proximately 0.05 g were heated to 80 °C under vacuum for 4 h to remove all adsorbed species. The surface area was deter- mined by the BET theory. The activity of the catalysts for CO oxidation was measured using 50 mg sieved catalyst (250–500 m) and a gas mixture (2 vol% CO, 1 vol% O 2 , and N 2 balance) at a flow rate of 67 ml/min, corresponding to a space velocity of 80000 ml/(g·h). Gas composition was analyzed by a GC 7890T gas chromato- graph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). CO conversion X(CO) was calculated as X(CO) = ([CO] in [CO] out )/[CO] in . 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization results Fig. 1 shows the XRD analysis of all the as-prepared prod- ucts and confirms that these were pure ceria. The samples exhibited XRD peaks that correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (420), and (422) planes of the cubic fluorite structure (space group: Fm3m) of CeO 2 as identified using the standard data JCPDS 34-0394. The average crystal- lite sizes (D) of the CeO 2 nanorods, nanocubes, and nanop- olyhedra calculated from the X-ray line broadening of the (111) reflections using the Scherrer equation were 41.8, 20.3, and 16.7 nm, respectively. The N 2 adsorption data are given in Fig. 2. The nanorods had a higher pore volume and smaller pore size distribution than the nanopolyhedra and nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 3, the various CeO 2 displayed homogeneous morphology, respectively. Gold colloid can be uniformly dispersed on the surface of CeO 2 by Fig. 2.

JIA Kunming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(11): 1089–1092 colloid-deposition. The Au nanoparticles size was below 5 nm. According to adsorption measurement, the BET surface areas of the nanorods, cubes, and polyhedra were 10.3, 29.7, and 58.8 m 2 /g, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic activity of the Au-CeO 2 catalysts The activity of the Au/CeO 2 catalysts for CO oxidation was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 4. For comparison, the activity of the pure ceria supports was also measured. As can be seen, without gold nanoparticles, there was almost no activity for all three different morphology ceria until a tem- perature of 200 °C. However, when gold nanoparticles were loaded, the situation was quite different. Au particles were very active with the nanorod and the nanopolyhedra ceria, while the reaction with the Au and nanocube ceria was very slow. The size of the nanorod and the nanopolyhedra ceria were at least one to two orders of magnitude larger than the Au parti- cles and they combined into nanostructured catalysts [18]. The CO conversion on Au/CeO 2 nanorods enclosed by (110+100) planes and nanopolyhedra enclosed by (100+111) planes was much higher than on Au/CeO 2 nanocubes enclosed by (100) planes. The (100) was not an active plane for Au. It is known that high surface area oxides can exhibit nu- merous edges and corners for the adsorption and activation of reactants. However, in the lower temperature range of 60–140 °C, the Au/CeO 2 nanorods with a higher surface area were less active catalysts, whereas the Au/CeO 2 nanopolyhedra with a lower surface area was more active. This unusual result for these two ceria nanomaterials indicated to us that specific crystal planes were indeed a determining factor. We deduced that the (111) plane was more effective than the (110) plane for CO oxidation. When the temperature was increased to a higher temperature range of 140–200 °C, the catalyst needed more sites and the A BET value became the determining factor, so Fig. 3.

Catalytic activity of different morphology of CeO 2 (a) and Au/CeO 2 (b) for CO oxidation. (1) Nanorods; (2) Nanocubes; (3) Nanopolyhedra. JIA Kunming et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(11): 1089–1092 Au/nanorod ceria became the best catalyst of the three. Ac- cording to these results, a correlation can be made between the catalytic performance and the crystal plane: CeO 2 nanorods and nanopolyhedra are more active than ceria nanoparticles with the (100) plane, and the activity order of ceria planes is (111) > (110) >> (100). By comparing the results obtained with the three catalysts, we can deduce that the activity of the Au/CeO 2 catalysts may not be due exclusively to Au, but the support itself is involved in the reaction. 3 Conclusions Gold-ceria catalysts were prepared by depositing gold col- loids on different ceria that were nanorods, nanocubes, and nanopolyhedra, respectively, which were synthesized by a hydrothermal treatment. Nanocube ceria enclosed by (100) planes was the least active support of the three for CO oxida- tion. (100) planes are inactive planes for a Au catalyst. Au/nanopolyhedra ceria has the better activity in a lower temperature range, while Au/nanorod ceria had the best activity in a higher temperature range.
