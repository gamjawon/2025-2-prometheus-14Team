DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60407-5 ARTICLE Effect of Alkaline-Earth Metal Oxides on Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 Catalyst for Vapor-Phase Synthesis of 3-Methylindole from Glycerol and Aniline WANG Zhaoyu, LI Xiaohui, ZHANG Yue, SHI Lei*, SUN Qi Institute of Chemistry for Functionalized Materials, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian 116029, Liaoning, China Abstract: The effect of the addition of an alkaline-earth metal oxide (MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO) to a Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst for the va- por-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH 3 temperature-programmed desorption, and thermogravim- etric and differential thermal analysis. MgO reinforced the interaction between copper and the support, which promoted the dispersion of Cu particles. In addition, MgO increased the amount of weak acid sites and inhibited the formation of coke. As a result, the addition of MgO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 gave a much improved catalyst. Adding CaO, SrO or BaO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 deteriorated the catalysts because the disper- sion of Cu particles became worse and the amounts of weak acid sites on Cu-SrO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and Cu-BaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 were fewer. The addition of the alkaline-earth metal oxides did not change the texture of the coke formed. Key words: copper; silica; aluminum oxide; alkaline-earth metal oxides; 3-methylindole; glycerol; aniline 3-Methylindole is one of the most important indole deriva- tives used in industry, agriculture, and medicine [1â€“5]. It is used in perfumes and in the manufacture of herbicides, fungi- cides, dyes, antihypertensive and anticancer medicines [6â€“8]. In addition, 3-methylindole is an interesting chromophore which is used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry [9]. Many routes have been developed for the synthesis of 3-methylindole. Among these, the classical Fischer synthesis used for several decades is the most common [10]. Bischler synthesis and Madelung synthesis are also popular routes [11,12]. Although these well-known liquid phase reactions give 3-methylindole in good yield, many drawbacks existed, such as the use of complicated and expensive reagents, a large number of toxic solvents, heavy pollution and severe reaction conditions [13â€“16]. These limit the application of 3-methylindole. Thus, increasing interest has been focused on the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole. The literature is rich in data regarding the vapor-phase syn- thesis of indoles [17], but scarce for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole. Subrahmanyam et al. [18] reported the synthesis of 3-methylindole from indole and methanol (molar ratio of indole/methanol was 1:6) over a Ce/HY zeolite cata- lyst. The yield of 3-methylindole was 30%. Siwach et al. [12] developed a Ni 1-x Mn x Fe 2 O 4 catalyst for the reaction and im- proved the yield of 3-methylindole up to 54%. Campanati et al. [17] reported a ZrO 2 /SiO 2 catalyst for the synthesis of 3-methylindole from 1,2-propanediol and aniline, but the yield of 3-methylindole was only 12%. Our study found that Ag/SiO 2 was an active catalyst for the reaction and the yield of 3-methylindole reached 35% [19]. However, Ag/SiO 2 showed poor stability. The lifetime of the catalyst dropped rapidly with time. In recent years, the use of glycerol has become an impor- tant research topic in catalysis [20â€“22]. Glycerol is the main byproduct (about 10 wt%) from biodiesel production, and the effective utilization of glycerol can contribute to the economic production of biodiesel. One of the most attractive approaches is the catalytic conversion of glycerol to high value added chemicals, which agrees with the concept of green chemistry in terms of the utilization of renewable resources. WANG Zhaoyu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1139â€“1145 Very recently, we developed a new approach for the va- por-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole by feeding glycerol and aniline as reactants [23]. Over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the yield of 3-methylindole reached 40% and the stability of the catalyst was much better than that of Ag/SiO 2 applied in the conversion of 1,2-propanediol and aniline. Since glycerol, which comes from biomass, is cheap and abundant, and also a green feed- stock for the production of various chemicals [21,24], this reaction is a most promising route from the economic and environmental viewpoints. It is well known that alkaline-earth metal oxides can pro- mote catalytic performance [25â€“28]. In this paper, an alka- line-earth metal oxide (MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO) was added to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H 2 tem- perature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), NH 3 tempera- ture-programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD), and TG-DTA tech- niques were used to investigate and explain the relationship between the structure of the Cu-based catalysts and their catalytic performance. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wet- ness impregnation. SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (20â€“40 mesh) was impregnated with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate for 15 h at room temperature, then dried at 120 o C for 4 h and calcined at 500 o C for 4 h to get the catalyst precursor. The Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst doped with MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO was prepared by sequential impregnation. First, SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 was pre-impregnated with an aqueous nitrate solution of Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba for 15 h at room temperature, then dried at 120 o C for 4 h and calcined at 500, 600, 800 or 800 o C, respectively, for 4 h to obtain MO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba). MO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 was then impregnated with an aqueous solution of copper nitrate for 15 h, then dried and calcined as with the Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 cata- lyst described above to obtain the alkaline-earth metal oxide promoted catalyst. Prior to activity evaluation, 3 ml catalyst was reduced in a gas mixture composed of N 2 (30 ml/min) and H 2 (30 ml/min) at 250 o C for 2 h, then cooled to 240 o C in 0.5 h and kept at this temperature for another 0.5 h. The loading of the active com- ponent, copper, was 0.9 mmol/g. The amount of alkaline-earth metal oxide was 0.1 mmol/g. 1.2 Catalytic activity measurement The catalytic reaction was carried out in a fixed bed con- tinuous flow glass reactor with an inside diameter of 12 mm under atmospheric pressure. The reactor was placed vertically inside a tubular furnace and heated electrically. The reactor temperature was monitored by a thermocouple with its tip located at the catalyst bed and connected to a temperature controller. The solution of reactants (molar ratio of ani- line/glycerol = 3:1) was pumped through the preheater where it was vaporized and the reactants were carried into the reactor by flowing H 2 (10 ml/min), steam (12 ml/h), and N 2 (58 ml/min). The reaction was carried out at 240 o C. The quantitative analysis of the reactants and products was carried out on a SP-6890A gas chromatograph equipped with a SE-54 capillary column. 1-Hexyl alcohol was used as an internal standard. 1.3 Catalyst characterization XRD pattern was recorded using a D8 advance diffraction meter with a Cu K Ä® radiation source at a scan rate of 0.5 o /min in the 2È™ range of 30 o â€“80 o . The voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. TEM experiments were done on a JEM-2000EX electron microscope at the accelerating voltage of 50 kV. The samples were crushed and dispersed in alcohol and then spread on a holey carbon Cu microgrid. The particle size distribution was obtained from several micrographs. The average particle size was estimated using the equation d = Â™(n i Â·d i )/Â™n i , where n i was the number of particles with di- ameter d i and Â™n i was the number of particles used to com- pute the size distribution. H 2 -TPR experiments were carried out in a quartz reactor with inside diameter of 6 mm and length of 350 mm. A 100 mg sample was pretreated in a flow of ultrapure nitrogen gas of 50 ml/min at 100 o C for 1 h to remove water and other contami- nants. TPR profiles were obtained by heating the sample under a 10% H 2 /Ar flow (50 ml/min) from 50 to 450 o C at a linearly programmed rate of 10 o C/min. The hydrogen consumption was recorded with a thermal conductivity detector. NH 3 -TPD was carried out in the quartz reactor used in H 2 -TPR experi- ments. A sample of 150 mg was pretreated at 500 o C for 1 h in a flow of ultrapure helium gas (30 ml/min) to remove water and other contaminants from the catalyst and cooled to 100 o C, then saturated with ammonia gas at 100 o C. After the sample was purged with helium gas (30 ml/min) at 100 o C for 2 h to remove physisorbed ammonia, TPD was carried out from 100 to 700 o C with a temperature ramp of 10 o C/min. TG-DTA analysis was carried out with a TG/DTA 6300 ap- paratus to characterize the coke on the catalyst. The used catalyst sample (7.8 mg) was placed in the pan. The sample was first heated in ultrapure nitrogen (20 ml/min) from room temperature to 300 o C at a heating rate of 10 o C /min to remove physisorbed species. After keeping at 50 o C, it was heated in air (20 ml/min) to 800 o C at a heating rate of 10 o C/min. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization WANG Zhaoyu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1139â€“1145 2.1.1 XRD and TEM results The XRD patterns of the fresh and used catalyst are shown in Fig. 1. Two diffraction peaks of copper at 2È™ of 43.3 o and 50.5 o , assigned to the (111) and (200) reflections [29], were observed on fresh Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 . The same diffraction peaks were seen on fresh Cu-MgO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , but the intensity was a little weaker. On adding CaO or SrO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the intensity of the diffraction peaks became stronger. With fresh Cu-BaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , another diffraction peak at 74.7 o , as- signed to the (220) reflection of copper, was observed and the intensity of the diffraction peaks was much stronger than that from fresh Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 . On the used Cu-based catalysts, three diffraction peaks at 2È™ of 43.3 o , 50.5 o , and 74.7 o were observed, and the intensity of the copper diffraction peaks from Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and the samples doped with MgO, CaO, or SrO became stronger. Figure 2 is TEM images of the fresh and used Cu-based catalysts. The average copper particle sizes obtained from these are shown in Table 1. The copper particle size of fresh Cu-MgO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 was smaller than that of fresh Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 . On fresh Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 doped with CaO, SrO or BaO, however, the copper particle sizes were much larger than that of fresh Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 . On the used Cu-based cata- lysts, the copper particle sizes became larger compared with those of the fresh catalysts. From the results in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1, it can easily be seen that MgO promoted the dispersion of copper particles on the support. The addition of CaO, SrO, or BaO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 brought about a poorer dispersion of Cu parti- cles. There was sintering of copper particles during the reac- tion. Adding alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 did not inhibit the sintering of Cu particles. 2.1.2 H 2 -TPR results The reduction behavior of CuO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and the alka- Fig. 2.

WANG Zhaoyu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1139â€“1145 line-earth metal oxides doped samples was investigated by H 2 -TPR. The profiles are shown in Fig. 3. No hydrogen con- sumption peak was seen in the temperature range of 150â€“400 o C with the MO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba) samples, which indicated that the alkaline-earth metal oxides were not reduced in this temperature range. The reduction peak of CuO was shifted towards higher temperature after adding MgO to CuO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , which implied that there existed a strong interaction between CuO and the support that resulted in a better dispersion of CuO particles on the support and made the reduction of CuO more difficult. The reduction peaks of CuO were shifted towards a lower temperature in the order of CaO, SrO and BaO, which revealed that the interaction between CuO and the support became weaker, and as a result, CuO particles aggromerated and were reduced easily [30]. 2.1.3 NH 3 -TPD result The desorption of NH 3 provides information about the dis- tribution and amount of acid sites on the catalyst. The NH 3 -TPD profiles of Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and the alkaline-earth metal oxide doped catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. Three de- sorption peaks were observed. The peak at the lower tem- Ë˜perature ( 220 o C) was assigned to weak acid sites, while the others at the higher temperatures (220â€“450 o C) corresponded to the medium-strong acid sites. After adding MgO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the amount of weak acid sites increased, and the amount of the medium-strong acid sites decreased. On Cu-CaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , both the amounts of weak acid sites and medium-strong acid sites increased. On Cu-SrO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and Cu-BaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the amount of the weak acid sites decreased, but the medium-strong acid sites were increased. 2.1.4 TG-DTA analysis Many investigations showed that coking during the reaction is one of the reasons for the deactivation of the catalyst [31]. TG-DTA analysis was used to investigate the formation of the coke. TG-DTA results of used Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and alka- line-earth metal oxide doped catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. An obvious mass loss was observed, suggesting the formation of coke during the reaction. Since the mass loss from used Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 doped with MgO, SrO or BaO decreased compared with that from used CuO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , it can be de- duced that the alkaline-earth metal oxides inhibited the forma- tion of coke. The mass loss increased a little on Cu-CaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , which indicated that CaO did not sup- press the formation of coke. From Figs. 4 and 5(a), it is easily found that the amount of the coke was correlated with the amount of acid sites on the catalysts. With more acid sites, there was more coke. In Fig. 5(b), two exothermic peaks were observed, which revealed that there existed two types of coke. The exothermic peak at 355 o C was assigned to the removal of easily oxidized carbon. Another exothermic peak at 470 o C was the oxidation of regular or graphitic carbon. There was no obvious shift for the exothermic peaks on used Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 doped with the al- kaline-earth metal oxides, which indicated that the addition of the alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 did not change the texture of the coke.

WANG Zhaoyu et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1139â€“1145 2.2 Activity of Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 doped with alkaline-earth metal oxides The effect of alkaline-earth metal oxide additives on the performance of the Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline is shown in Fig. 6. Over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , glycerol conversion decreased with time on stream and 3-methylindole yield increased during the first 3 h, and then dropped. A similar phenomenon was seen over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 doped with MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO, although the activity and stability were rather different. Over Cu-MgO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , glycerol conversion and 3-methylindole yield were higher than that over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and the stabil- ity was improved. The yield of 3-methylindole was up to 46% at the third hour of reaction. Over Cu-CaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , al- though the initial activity was higher than that over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the stability was poor, and the final yield of 3-methylindole was lower than that over Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 . After adding SrO or BaO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , both activity and sta- bility decreased. For the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from ani- line and glycerol, it has been found that a Cu-based catalyst with good dispersion and large amount of weak acid sites was superior for the production of 3-methylindole [25]. The char- acterization results showed that MgO enhanced the interaction between the active component of copper and the support, which promoted the dispersion of Cu particles on the support. In addition, MgO increased the amount of weak acid sites and decreased the amount of the medium-strong acid sites, which helped the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst and the de- sorption of 3-methylindole from the catalyst. Moreover, MgO helped suppressing the formation of coke. As a result, the addition of MgO promoter improved the performance of the catalyst remarkably. Adding CaO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 increased the amount of the weak acid sites, which enhanced the initial activity of the catalyst, but it brought about a poor dispersion of Cu particles on the support and a larger amount of the me- dium-strong acid sites, which resulted in a low final activity and poor stability of the catalyst. On Cu-SrO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 or Cu-BaO/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , the dispersion of Cu particles became worse and the amount of the weak acid sites was much less than that on Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 , and as a result, the activity of the catalyst was low and the stability was poor. 3 Conclusions The addition of MgO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 enhanced the activ- ity and stability of the catalyst for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline. The yield of 3-methylindole was increased to 46% after three hour of reac- tion. The promoting effect of MgO stemmed from its ability to improve the dispersion of copper particles and increase the amount of weak acid sites, as well as suppressing the formation of coke during the reaction. The addition of CaO, SrO or BaO to Cu/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 decreased the dispersion of copper particles, 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 0.70 0.72 0.74 0.76 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 (a) (3) (1) (2) (5) (4) M a s s ( m g ) Tempareture ( o C) (b) (5) (4) (3) (2) (1) I n t e n s i t y Fig. 5.

Tel: +86-411-82158329; Fax: +86-411-84258309 The effect of the addition of an alkaline-earth metal oxide (MgO, CaO, SrO or BaO) to a Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 catalyst for the vapor-phase synthesis of 3-methylindole from glycerol and aniline was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, and thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis. MgO reinforced the interaction between copper and the support, which promoted the dispersion of Cu particles. In addition, MgO increased the amount of weak acid sites and inhibited the formation of coke. As a result, the addition of MgO to Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 gave a much improved catalyst. Adding CaO, SrO or BaO to Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 deteriorated the catalysts because the dispersion of Cu particles became worse and the amounts of weak acid sites on Cu-SrO/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cu-BaO/SiO2-Al2O3 were fewer. The addition of the alkaline-earth metal oxides did not change the texture of the coke formed. 摘要 研究了碱土金属氧化物的添加对丙三醇和苯胺气相合成 3-甲基吲哚的 Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 催化剂性能的影响, 采用 X 射线衍射、透射电镜、H2 程序升温还原、NH3 程序升温脱附以及热重-差热等技术对催化剂进行了表征. 结果表明, MgO 能加强活性组分和载体之间的相互作用, 从而促进铜粒子在载体上的分散. 另外, MgO 能增加弱酸中心数, 并且抑制积炭的形成, 因而 Cu-MgO/SiO2-Al2O3 催化剂性能大大提高; 而 CaO, SrO 或 BaO 的加入不利于 Cu/SiO2-Al2O3 催化剂上 3-甲基吲哚的生成. 这是由于铜粒子在载体上的分散度变差, 而且在 Cu-SrO/SiO2-Al2O3 及 Cu-BaO/SiO2-Al2O3 催化剂上弱酸中心数较少. 碱土金属氧化物的加入不能改变催化剂上积炭的结构.
