Graphical abstract The reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene could be effectively proceeded in the presence of palladium complex and acid-functionalized ionic liquids. Based on the diversity of ionic liquids, i.e. tunable structure and physicochemical properties, a series of functional ionic liquids and palladium complexes were investigated, and a highly effective catalyst system, Pd(phen)Cl2-BAcImPF6 ionic liquid (phen=1,10-phenanthroline; BAcIm=1-butyl-3-acetic acid-imidazolium), was developed for the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene to give the corresponding carbamate with higher than 90% of conversion and selectivity at 150°C and 6MPa carbon monoxide. The high catalytic performance is attributed to the acidic function of the BAcImPF6 ionic liquid and the interaction between Pd(phen)Cl2 and the ionic liquid to form the catalytically active palladium complex Pd(phen)2(PF6)2. Keywords Nitrobenzene Carbon monoxide Carbonylation Ionic liquids Palladium complex 1 Introduction In the last 20 years, there have been numerous attempts to produce carbamates, which could be intermediates for producing isocyanates through non-phosgene methods [1–8]. One of the most convenient approaches has been the catalytically reductive carbonylation of nitro compounds with carbon monoxide in the presence of alcohol using group VIII transition metals or their compounds as catalysts [2–4,6]. Till today, palladium complexes have been regarded as the most effective catalysts. Large amounts of liquid acid co-catalysts, such as HCl and H3PO4, etc., which volatility and toxicity usually cause serious environment problems, are needed in order to achieve good results. Therefore, development of an environmentally benign co-catalyst system for the reductive carbonylation of nitro-containing compounds is highly desired. Ionic liquids are molten salts and usually composed of organic cations and inorganic anions. They have received much attention due to their thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure, peculiar ion environment and diversity [9–16]. Recently, it has been reported that ionic liquids could be effective reaction media or co-catalysts for the oxidative carbonylation of aniline to yield the corresponding carbamate, which offered a new way for developing a highly efficient and environmentally friendly carbonylation process [17,18]. However, problems such as the formation of water as byproduct, which may cause anions hydrolysis, the potential explosion of the CO+O2 mixture gas and the high price of aniline because it was derived from hydrogenation of nitrobenzene are difficult to overcome. On the other hand, the use of ionic liquids as promoters in the reductive carbonylation of nitro-containing compounds has been scarcely dealt with, although the diversity and non-volatility of ionic liquids may offer good opportunities to find a proper and environment benign ionic liquid-mediated noble-metal complex catalyst system. We wish to report that a catalyst system composed of the proper palladium complex and ionic liquid could be very effective for the formation of ethyl phenyl carbamate by reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene in the presence of ethanol as illustrated in Scheme 1 . 2 Experimental 2.1 Compounds and materials The ionic liquids and palladium complexes Pd(phen)Cl2 (phen=1,10-phenanthroline), Pd(phen)2(BF4)2 and Pd(phen)2(PF6)2 were synthesized according to previously published methods [19–22] with slight modifications. PdCl2, Pd(OAc)2, (NH4)2PdCl4 and phenanthroline were of AR grade. The ionic liquids indicated in Scheme 2 were used in this work. The characterizations of ionic liquids and palladium complexes were conducted with elementary analysis (Elementar Vario EL), NMR (Varian Inova 400) and FTIR (Nicolet Nodule 5700). 2.2 Reaction procedure All reactions were conducted in a 90ml autoclave with a glass tube inside equipped with magnetic stirring. In each reaction, 0.017mmol Pd complex catalyst, 10mg phenanthroline, 30mg ionic liquid, 0.5ml nitrobenzene, 5ml ethanol and 6.0MPa of carbon monoxide (purity 99.99%) were successively introduced without any additional organic solvent. The reaction proceeded at 150°C for 3h. When the conversion and selectivity were high enough, pale yellow solid methyl phenyl carbamate could be deposited after addition of 10ml H2O and it could be obtained by simple filtration. Qualitative analyses were conducted with a HP 6890/5973 GC–MS. The conversion of nitrobenzene was measured with an Agilent 6820 GC equipped with a FID detector using an external standard method, and the selectivities were calculated according to the chromatographic peak areas of the resulting products given by the GC chemstation. 3 Results and discussion The ionic liquids based on dialkyl imidazolium with BF4 − and PF6 − anions as co-catalyst were explored. The results were shown in Table 1 . The catalytic activities of PdCl2, Pd(OAc)2 and (NH4)2PdCl4 were examined and poor to moderate conversions (19–50%) and selectivities (26–67%) were obtained (Entries 1–3). The main byproduct was azoxybenzene and trace amounts of aniline, phenyl isocyanate, nitroso benzene and azobenzene (<0.5% in total) were also detected in the reaction mixtures. In order to further improve the catalytic activity, Pd(phen)Cl2, Pd(phen)2(BF4)2 and Pd(phen)2(PF6)2 were tested in the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene because the introduction of phenanthroline could improve the catalytic activity of palladium complexes in carbonylation reactions. As expected, much higher conversion of nitrobenzene (67–85%) and good selectivity to ethyl phenyl carbamate (77–91%) were achieved although they were not high enough (Entries 4–6). Pd(phen)Cl2 was selected as the catalyst to explore the effect of ionic liquids as co-catalyst on the reductive carbonylation reaction. The results showed that the addition of ionic liquids as co-catalysts effectively promoted the conversion of nitrobenzene and the selectivity to ethyl phenyl carbamate (Entries 7–13). The best results were achieved over the Pd(phen)Cl2/BMImPF6 ionic liquid catalyst system, in which the conversion reached 90% with >95% selectivity to ethyl phenyl carbamate. Good result was also obtained in the presence of the BMImBF4 ionic liquid with 85% conversion and 92% selectivity. Therefore, the anions in dialkyl ionic liquids have a strong impact on the catalytic activity of the palladium complex and the following sequence was observed, PF6 − >BF4 − >Br− >Cl−. The presence of large amounts of Br− and Cl− anions caused partial deactivation of the palladium complex. The substituted alkyl group of the imidazolium side chain also affected the catalytic activity to a certain extent. Along with the increasing number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group (from 2 to 10), the conversion of nitrobenzene decreased from 91 to 59%, although the selectivity was only varied slightly (Entries 10–13). A series of relatively novel acid functional ionic liquids were also investigated in the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene because acids were usually effective co-catalysts for this reaction (see Table 2 ). In comparison with the results in Table 1, the incorporation of a carboxyl group in the side chain of the imidazolium cation could effectively improve the selectivity of the carbonylation reaction. The selectivity to ethyl phenyl carbamate reached 98.8, 97.9 and 96% with conversions of 85, 94 and 94.5% when using BACImBF4, BACImPF6 and MBAImPF6 as co-catalysts, respectively, (Table 2, Entries 1–3). These results were better than those obtained in the presence of BMImBF4 and BMImPF6 ionic liquids. At the same time, substitution of BF4 − and PF6 − anions in functional ionic liquids with Br−, and especially with Cl−, also led to the decrease of the conversion and selectivity (Table 2, Entries 4 and 5), which was quite similar to those using ordinary dialkyl ionic liquids as co-catalysts. Using carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquids with longer side chains, BPAImBr, BPAImBr and BOAImBr, as co-catalysts, gave poor results for the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene, both the conversions and selectivities decreased with the increasing of the numbers of the carbon atoms (Table 2, Entries 6–8). Sulfonic acid group functionalized ionic liquids, the most popular acid functional ionic liquids with strong acid strength, were also tested in the carbonylation reaction. However, less good results in comparison with the carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquids were obtained (Table 2, Entries 9–12). In comparison with the results obtained using ordinary dialkyl ionic liquids, carboxyl and sulfonic acid-functionalized ionic liquids as co-catalysts, the following conclusions could be obtained: (1) the best results were achieved in the presence of an ionic liquid containing a carboxyl group and BF4 −, PF6 − anions; (2) the selection of the co-catalyst should not only be based on acid strength and (3) imidazolium ions with a shorter side chain, i.e. 2–4 carbon atoms, which are more hydrophilic and possessed appropriate coordination effects on the metal complex, promoted the conversion of nitrobenzene to ethyl phenyl carbamate more effectively. Although the catalytic activity using acid-functionalized ionic liquid as co-catalysts were lower (TOF∼150mol/(molh)) than that the reported most active catalyst system for reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene (TOF∼6000mol/(molh)) [4], it offered us a new choice for this process because the volatile and toxic phosphorus acids could be avoided. It is worthwhile investigating the role of ionic liquids in the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene. According to the mechanisms previously reported, there are two strategies to achieve satisfactory results [23,24]. The first one is the selection of non-coordinating anions, i.e. PF6 − and BF4 −. The other one is the presence of acid co-catalysts. Therefore, the reason for the high catalytic activity exhibited in the presence of PF6 − and BF4 − containing ionic liquids should first be attributed to the ion exchange between PF6 −/BF4 − and Cl−, i.e. the formation of Pd(phen)2(BF4)2 or Pd(phen)2(PF6)2. As to the carboxyl-functionalized ionic liquids, the presence of the carboxyl group could effectively promote the ion exchange of ionic liquids with the palladium complex, which may possess a more suitable acid strength than the sulfonic acid-functionalized ionic liquids, therefore a better catalytic performance was achieved. The replacement of PF6 − and BF4 − anions in the ionic liquids with Br− or Cl− would strengthen the coordination between halogen ions and palladium complex, thus resulting in a poor catalytic performance. Pd-carbenes, which are usually produced from imidazolium-based compounds and palladium complexes and play an important role in many catalytic processes, are not a catalytic active species in the reductive carbonylation reaction because a basic component is necessary for the deprotonation of –C(2)H of the imidazolium cation [25]. FTIR characterization showed that no changes occurred in comparison with the spectra of the BAcImPF6 ionic liquid before and after addition of Pd(OAc)2 and Pd(phen)Cl2 (Fig. 1 ). This suggested that the interaction between the –C(2)H group of the imidazolium and palladium complexes was very weak, confirming that no Pd-carbene formed from the imidazolium cation and palladium complexes. The ion exchange between the ionic liquid and palladium complex was difficult to detect by FTIR because the anions had negligible effect on the FTIR spectra of the cations. 4 Conclusion An effective Pd(phen)Cl2 complex-BAcImPF6 ionic liquid catalyst system was developed for the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene to the corresponding carbamate. The diversity of ionic liquids enabled us to find an optimal co-catalyst towards a specific reaction. The synergism between the palladium complexes and the ionic liquid, and the multi-function possessed by the ionic liquids are the reason for the high catalytic efficiency.

        "dc:description": "Based on the diversity of ionic liquids, i.e. tunable structure and physicochemical properties, a series of functional ionic liquids and palladium complexes were investigated, and a highly effective catalyst system, Pd(phen)Cl2-BAcImPF6 ionic liquid (phen=1,10-phenanthroline; BAcIm=1-butyl-3-acetic acid-imidazolium), was developed for the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzene to give the corresponding carbamate with higher than 90% of conversion and selectivity at 150°C and 6MPa carbon monoxide. The high catalytic performance is attributed to the acidic function of the BAcImPF6 ionic liquid and the interaction between Pd(phen)Cl2 and the ionic liquid to form the catalytically active palladium complex Pd(phen)2(PF6)2.",
