A TPR-TPD study Vfctor H. Sandoval, Carlos E. Gigola * Planta Piloto de hzgenieria Qufmica, PLAPIQUL 12 de Octubre 1842, 8000 Bahia Blanca, Argentina Received 12 March 1996; revised 10 June 1996; accepted 12 June 1996 Abstract Low loaded (< 0.5 wt.-%) palladium on a-A1203 catalysts were prepared using palladium acetylacetonate as a chemical precursor. Temperature programmed reduction studies (TPR) indicate that in the initial oxidized state a fraction of palladium exhibits a strong interaction with the alumina support. Hydrogen treatments remove the interaction allowing the formation of palladium particles that upon reoxidation stabilize the palladium as PdO~.4. Bimetallic Pd-Pb catalysts were obtained by reacting the palladium catalysts with tetra-n-butyl lead. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide desorption studies (TPD) have shown that progressive lead addition suppresses the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen as well as the multiple coordinated forms of carbon monoxide. For hydrogen, the TPD spectra supports the existence of an ensemble effect upon alloying. On the other hand the increased adsorption strength of multiple coordinated carbon monoxide suggested the presence of a ligand effect. Another important effect of lead on the TPD of carbon monoxide is the inhibition of carbon dioxide formation. The role of lead in improving the selectivity of alkynes hydrogenation reactions is discussed.

Gigola / Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 A1203 is widely used in this and other industrial hydrogenation processes [1] extensive research has been done in order to improve its selectivity, particularly at high levels of alkynes or alkadienes conversion. By alloying palladium with copper [2], lead [3], nickel [4] and other metals [5] remarkable results have been obtained in the sense that the parallel undesirable hydrogenation of alkenes and the direct hydrogenation of alkynes to alkanes was suppressed. Despite the important practical implications of these findings the role of lead in the mechanism of hydrogenation on Pd-Pb catalysts is still unclear. One study [2] suggested that the second metal limits the adsorption of multiple coordinated species responsible for the direct transformation of alkynes to alkanes. Others support the formation of a special site where the strength of adsorption of the unsaturated hydrocarbons is modified, such as the intermetallic compound Pd3Pb proposed by Palczewska et al. [3]. As already stated [6,7], the main difficulties for discriminating between different interpretations are the variety of preparation methods and the limited characterization of the catalyst surface. For Pd/c~-Al203 a preparation method that uses palladium acetylaceto- nate as a precursor becomes available for obtaining Pd particles of varying dispersion on the low surface area support [8]. In addition combined XPS and TEM studies have shown that flat particles with a large metal-support interac- tion are obtained at low loadings [9]. From these monometallic catalysts true Pd-Pb particles can be obtained by reacting tetra-n-butyl lead with the prere- duced Pd surface [10]. Several Pd-Pb/a-Al203 catalysts prepared by this technique were used in a detailed XPS study that provided evidence of alloy formation [11]. In the present work a further characterization of similar Pd/a- A1203 and Pd-Pb/a-A1203 samples has been carried out by TPR and TPD measurements. Regarding the monometallic catalysts our interest was in the oxidation-reduc- tion behaviour of the small, highly interactive Pd particles. According to Otto and co-workers [12,13] the reducibility and oxidation state of Pd/a-A1203 catalysts depends on the metal loading; at > 0.5 wt.-% larger oxidized particles were reduced to metallic palladium at room temperature. On the other hand, at lower palladium loadings Pd is highly dispersed and remains mostly oxidized when exposed to hydrogen at room temperature. In addition, using temperature programmed oxidation on low loaded catalysts, an oxygen consumption signifi- cantly in excess of that expected for bulk PdO was found. On Pd-Pb/a-A1203 the aim was to study the effect of Pb on the availability and strength of hydrogen and CO adsorption. The selection of CO as a probe molecule allows the testing of multiple coordinated adsorption processes and the results can be compared with those derived from previous FTIR studies [10,11]. Moreover, it is important to state that CO is a well known additive used to improve the selectivity of commercial Pd hydrogenation catalysts. V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 83 2. Experimental In order to obtain an adequate metal dispersion using a low surface area o~-A1203 (10 m2/g), the Pd catalysts were prepared by impregnation with a benzene solution of palladium acetylacetonate [8]. A low surface area alumina is used in commercial alkynes hydrogenation catalysts to minimize the formation of surface oligomers and to avoid the undesirable hydrogenation of alkenes [2]. After 72 h the liquid was removed and the preparations were treated in flowing air while increasing the temperature by 2 K/min, up to 573 K, and maintaining it for 1 h. The reduction step was carried out at 573 K for 2 h. Samples obtained before and after the first reduction step were named precatalyst and catalyst, respectively. Bimetallic Pd-Pb catalysts were prepared by a controlled surface reaction method [9], employing tetra-n-butyl lead dissolved in n-heptane in contact with the reduced Pd catalyst. The reaction was performed at room temperature. After 24 h the samples were dried in nitrogen and reduced to 573 K in flowing hydrogen during 1 h. Metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. All samples were characterized by H2 and CO sorption, and TPR-TPD experiments. Particle size measurements by TEM were performed only on Pd samples. H2 and CO isotherms were measured in a volumetric glass adsorption apparatus equipped with a MKS Baratron type PDR-A pressure gage. An ultimate vacuum near 9.30. 10-4 Pa could be obtained, as measured by a Granville-Philips Model 274002 ionization gauge. Both H2 and CO uptakes were measured at room temperature after reduction at 573 K in flowing H: followed by overnight evacuation at the same temperature. The sorption method of Benson et al. [14] was used to determine the irreversible hydrogen and carbon monoxide uptakes, extrapolating the isotherms to zero pressure. The particle size distribution was determined by TEM using a JEOL 100 CX instrument operated in the bright field mode at 100 kV. More than 100 particles were examined in the TEM micrographs to obtain the particle size distribution and to calculate the volume/area average particle diameter. A home-made TPR-TPD apparatus was used to measure the H2 and CO profiles as a function of temperature, on oxidized and reduced samples. The Pyrex glass reactor was placed in brass furnace equipped with four electric heating cartridges, of 1000 W each. A Gow-Mac thermal conductivity cell was used as a detector and the temperature ramp was controlled by a /x-Data-Trak temperature programmer. The reducing gas for all TPR experiments was a mixture of 5% H~ in Ar. Oxidation was carried out at 573 K in air during 30 rain, then the samples were purged in Ar and cooled to 75 K prior to switching the gas flow to H2-Ar. The flow rate was 15 cm3/min at 101 kPa. Above room temperature, the temperature of the reactor was raised to 600 K at a rate of 12 K/min. Calibration of the TCD cell was performed by reduction of a known 84 V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 quantity of CuO (Johnson Matthey Grade 1). Water produced during the reduction process was removed by a molecular sieve trap located after the catalyst bed. For the hydrogen TPD experiments Ar was used as a carrier gas. The flow rate was 15 cm3/min and the heating rate was 42 K/rain. The sample was previously reduced in a 5% Hz-Ar mixture at 573 K, during 30 min, then cooled to room temperature and switched to Ar flow. Carbon monoxide TPD experiments employed He as carrier gas, with a flow rate of 20 cm3/min and a heating rate of 16 K/rain. The samples were previously reduced at 573 K in pure H2, purged in He at 773 K during 20 min and finally cooled at room temperature. The injection of CO pulses (0.19 cm3) was performed at 298 K. In order to estimate the amount of H2 and CO desorbed, known volumes of these gases were injected to the Ar or He flow and the peak area was measured. 3. Results 3.1. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide chemisorption Palladium catalysts of varying metal dispersion were obtained adjusting the metal loading (0.10-0.23%) and the hydrogen reduction temperature (573-773 K). The addition of Pb was done on the Pd sample with the higher metal content in order to facilitate the chemisorption measurements. The main results are presented in Table 1. The decreases in Pd surface area depend on the amount of Pb as indicated by the H/Pd values. The CO/Pd ratios were less affected by Pb, due to the possibility of having linear or multiple coordinated adsorption of CO on Pd. Consequently, the CO/H ratio for the bimetallic catalysts is equal or larger than that on monometallics. This behaviour has already been observed on other bimetallic catalysts [ 15,16].

V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996)81-96 85 The particle size estimated from the He uptakes was compared with TEM measurements for some Pd catalysts. The last two columns in Table 1 show that the results for samples 1 and 2 are not in good agreement. This could be due to the limitations to detect by TEM particles smaller than 1.0-1.5 nm, which may be present when the metal dispersion is relatively high. In addition the assump- tion of spherical particles may not be appropriated for a palladium phase showing a rather strong metal-support interaction [9]. 3.2. TPR The profiles shown in Fig. la-b correspond to samples with different Pd loadings and exposed metal fractions, but they present the same qualitative features. The precatalyst exhibits a peak maxima around 301-305 K, followed by the/3-hydride decomposition around 345-348 K and a broad reduction signal covering the 355-523 K temperature range.

In addition the broad H2 consumption band after the r-hydride decomposition was absent. The apparent peak observed between 223 K and 273 K in all the experiments could be assigned to argon adsorbed during cooling to 173 K in liquid nitrogen. This fact was confirmed with a TPR experiment of pure ce-A1203. Despite the modifications in the TPR profile, the H2 consumption for the precatalyst and the catalyst was the same. Another surprising result was a high hydrogen consumption, 45% in excess of that predicted from the reduction of PdO. It is important to state that this result is not due to inclusion of H2 used to form the /3-hydrade. The formation of palladium hydrade takes place during the reduction process but due to the low hydrogen partial pressure, 38 Tort, it decomposes at 345-348 K as indicated by the negative peaks in Fig. la-b. The H2 uptake for the reduction of palladium oxide was computed by integration of the TPR profiles up to a maximum temperature of 573 K, that is well above the decomposition temperature of fl-hydrade. Consequently, the complete elimation of absorbed H2 is assured. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between hydrogen consumption and moles of palladium for samples 1-4. Clearly the oxidation state of Pd after the air treatment at 573 K, seems to be higher than expected. TPR experiments on Pd-Pb catalysts were not performed due to the damag- ing effect of oxygen, which promotes the disruption of the Pd-Pb interaction. 3.3. TPD of hydrogen The desorption spectra of hydrogen for the Pd (0.23%) catalyst and those modified by lead addition are shown in Fig. 3. Several peaks are observed. The V.H. Sandoval, C.E.

Despite the Ar purge at room temperature, a small amount of hydrogen was still present for the TPD experiment. Starting at 380 K, three peaks at 415, 489 and 550 K were observed, an indication that hydrogen may be bounded to different Pd surface sites. The intensity of these peaks was reduced by the addition of lead, mainly those present at high temperatures, which should correspond to hydrogen strongly held by Pd. As observed in Table 2, quantitative analysis showed a reasonable agreement between the hydrogen uptake from sorption measurements and the value derived from the TPD profile. 3.4.

On the basis of previous IR studies the low temperature desorption is assigned to linear CO (CO1) and the high temperature peak to multiple coordinated CO (COm). This peak shows a shoulder at 713 K, due to the presence of CO2. The Pd sample favors the formation of CO2 by means of the CO disproportionation reaction leaving a carbon residue on the surface; 2CO ~ CO2 -~ Csup This hypothesis was confirmed by treating the sample in H2 after CO desorption and recording the desorption signal with a FID detector; the produc- tion of hydrocarbons was observed at 636 K. The CO2 signal was removed from the TPD profile by means of a 13-X molecular sieve trap located immediately after the catalysts bed, and the net CO profile was obtained. The remaining shoulder on the high temperature side may indicate the presence of three-fold coordinated species, with very high CO-substrate interaction [ 17,18]. For the low V.H. Sandoval, C.E.

On a Pd-Pb (0.23-0.04%) catalyst (Fig. 4b) COl desorbs in the same temperature range but a marked increase in intensity was observed. On the other hand the highly coordinated CO species accounts for only 25% of the total amount detected and the peak is shifted to 721 K. CO2 formation was not detected in this sample. Finally the Pd-Pb (0.20-0.27%) catalyst (Fig. 4c) with a very large addition of lead only shows the presence of an attenuated peak at 353 K, due to CO,. Consequently, the main effect of lead addition is the inhibition of CO adsorption in the multiple coordinated form. Table 3 compares the CO uptake from volumetric and flow adsorption with the amount detected by TPD measurements. The first two techniques showed a good agreement. On the other hand TPD values are lower; the Pd-Pb (0.23%- 0.04%) catalyst desorbs only half of the amount of CO adsorbed. As a large amount of COl desorbs at low temperatures, some losses may occur during the Ar purge at room temperature prior to the TPD experiment. The COJCOm ratio was estimated from the TPD spectra and the calculated values are shown in Table 4. It is clear that on Pd catalysts CO is mainly in the multiple coordinated form but on Pd-Pb catalysts the more significant peak is that of linear CO. Table 4 also shows the effect of exposed Pd atoms on the desorption products during TPD of CO. The amount of COm shows a small decrease with increasing dispersion for the monometallic catalysts. On the other hand, lead addition dilutes the surface palladium atoms, suppressing the adsorp- tion of multiple coordinated CO, but promoting the adsorption of linear CO.

Precatalyst and catalyst reduction features The precatalyst palladium fraction reduced at 301 K could be assigned to PdO particles formed during the calcination step. Considering that our samples were prepared using palladium acetylacetonate and the Pd loadings are low, a fraction of Pd remains fixed in the support and therefore the reduction process becomes more difficult leading to the broad hydrogen consumption peak observed on the first TPR experiment. According to the model proposed by Lessage-Rosenberg et al. [ 19] Pd atoms anchored to the support octahedral sites after calcination are removed during the first reduction process to form small metal crystallites. Once the metal particles are formed, subsequent oxidation-reduction cycles are characterized by a lower reduction temperature. Consequently the catalysts exhibit a single hydrogen consumption peak which is more intense but located around 283 K on subsequent TPR measurements. 4.1.2. Excess hydrogen consumption Fig. 2 shows a 45% increase in hydrogen consumption from that expected for the reduction of PdO. The same result was obtained for precatalysts and catalysts despite the changes in the TPR profiles. Consequently, our experiments indicate the existence of PdOl.4 species after an oxidation treatment at 573 K. A recent XPS study [9] has shown that low loaded reduced Pd/a-Al203 catalysts are characterized by a well-dispersed phase having a large interaction with the support. Moreover a raft-shaped model was assumed for these metal particles. Consequently, a different oxidation state may be expected, as compared with bulk Pd. We have measured the oxygen uptakes of several Pd/ce-Al203 catalysts of low metal content, at 573 K, to find an O/Pd ratio near 1.4 [20]. In addition, when these catalysts were used for the total oxidation of hydrocarbons [21] the results suggested that in the presence of oxygen the metal particles expose most of the Pd atoms to the reactants. Consequently, there is ample evidence to propose that Pd in the oxidized state is present in a well dispersed form, and the metal-support interaction is responsible for the high oxygen uptake, which in turn gives the anomalous hydrogen consumption during the TPR experiments. In line with this interpretation Otto et al. [13] using TPO experiments, observed the same behaviour for Pd/y-Al203 catalysts with palladium loadings lower than 0.5 wt.-%, while for higher loadings the oxygen consumption corresponded to that expected from reduction of PdO. According to the authors, in the former catalysts oxygen rich species are formed due to a metal-support interaction that produces a highly dispersed phase. The formation of a highly dispersed oxygen-rich Pd/AI203 surface species was first suggested by Lesage-Rosenberg et al. [19]. From extended X-ray V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 91 absorption fine structure (EXAFS), they determined that Pd (0.3-0.7%)/a- A1203 samples obtained from Pd-acetylacetonate had between five and six neighboring oxygen atoms, occupying octahedral aluminum-vacant sites after calcination. As mentioned by Otto et al. [13], up to four of these atoms may be from the support lattice and the remaining ones could be supplied by the gas phase. 4.2. TPD of hydrogen The profiles presented in Fig. 3 suggest at least three adsorbed states characterized by peaks at 415, 489 and 550 K, with a fraction of hydrogen desorbing above 573 K. Although we will attempt to assign these peaks to different adsorption sites it is important to point out that multiple peaks on a TPD profile may arise for many reasons as discussed by Michaelis et al. [22]. It is also well known [23] that peak position and shape are strongly influenced by experimental parameters such as the carrier flow rate, heating rate, transport limitations and readsorption effects. In our case the carrier flow and the heating rate were selected to obtain reproducible and noise free signals in order to compare the qualitative features of hydrogen desorption from Pd and Pd-Pb catalysts. Using a heating rate of 12 K/min, only a very broad peak with a maximum temperature of 500 K was observed. Increasing the heating rate to 42 K/min it was possible to distinguish several peaks as observed in Fi~. 3. As the average pore diameter of the catalysts particles is around 1900 A we can be confident that intraparticle effects are absent. On the other hand readsorption effects may became important due mainly to the low cartier flow rate and be responsible for the amount of hydrogen desorbed above 573 K. In general this complication shifts the peaks to higher temperatures. With the above limitations the three peaks located at 415, 489 and 550 K may be tentatively ascribed to adsorption of hydrogen on sites with different bonding energies. On Pd/SiO2 catalysts, Rieck and Bell [24] also found three desorption peaks located at 398, 463 and 573 K. Based on previous TPD studies on Pd single crystals [25] the authors have assigned the low temperature peaks to hydrogen desorption from a metal surface containing Pd (111) and Pd (100) planes. On the other hand a high temperature desorption peak for Pd/SiO2 has been assigned to hydrogen coming from subsurface Pd sites [26]. According to the authors, adsorbed hydrogen diffuses into subsurface sites during the TPD experiments and then moves back when the desorption process is completed. Although a similar interpretation may be used for the present results another possibility is to assign the peaks to hydrogen chemisorbed on top, bridge and multiple coordinated forms on a given surface plane. A theoretical investigation [27] on the interaction of atomic hydrogen with Pd (111) clusters has shown that the strength of the chemisorption bond for the three-fold hollow site is larger 92 V.H. SandovaL C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 than that of the bridge and the top sites. Therefore the TPD peaks observed in our Pd (0.23%) catalyst may support the existence of monocrystalline particles derived from the special preparation method [9]. Turning to the Pd-Pb catalysts, Fig. 3 shows that the intensity of the low temperature peak, assigned to /3-hydride decomposition, remains unaltered. This suggests that the addition of lead does not modifies the bulk structure of palladium. The temperature shift, from 333 K to 352 K indicates that the release of adsorbed hydrogen is restricted by the presence of lead. Fig. 3 also shows that the presence of lead essentially affects the quantity of adsorbed H2. The strength of adsorption remains the same as long as the position of the peaks is not altered. It is observed that the high temperature peaks are strongly modified by a small amount of Pb addition while the peak at 415 K is similar to that of the Pd catalyst. This suggests that hydrogen adsorption on Pd (111) or on-top sites is not altered when the Pb loading is small, and the main effect of Pb is to inhibit the adsorption of hydrogen on Pd (100) surfaces or in multiple coordinated positions. However when lead loading was around 0.10 wt.-%, all H2 desorp- tions peaks were attenuated. Therefore different types of metal sites can be selected by controlling the amount of lead. These results support the existence of an ensemble effect due to lead addition. It is necessary to make clear that lead atoms could be over the palladium surface (adatom) or substituting them in the crystalline structure (an alloy with a higher lattice parameter), but in any case they produce a dilution of the surface Pd atoms, limiting the capacity for hydrogen dissociation, adsorption and/or penetration into subsurface sites. 4.3. TPD of carbon monoxide Numerous IR studies have shown that the adsorption of CO on supported Pd catalysts first gives rise to a broad band between 1700-2000 cm-1 that corresponds to CO bonded to two or three Pd atoms. At high coverage a band assigned to linear species appears at 2070-2090 cm-1. Upon evacuation at room temperature this band shows a strong decrease in intensity because the linear form is weakly adsorbed. The present TPD results are in full agreement with the picture described above. On the Pd (0.23 wt.-%) catalyst desorption starts near room temperature, with a flat profile that extends up to 573 K. CO readsorption may be responsible for this behaviour. Subsequently, a more prominent desorption peak, due to multiple coordinated CO, appears at 658 K. The TPD profiles give a clear evidence on the effect of Pd dispersion on the amount of CO adsorbed in the linear or multiple coordinated form. The COl/COm ratio increases as the particle size decreases, as shown in Table 4 for samples 2 and 3. Samples with large particle size favour the presence of multiple coordinated CO species, while those with high dispersion have small particles, where linear CO is adsorbed. These results are in good agreement with KH. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 93 those obtained by Rieck and Bell [24] for Pd/SiO2 catalysts. A similar TPD profile, characterized by two CO peaks and one CO2 peak, have been reported for Pd on a-Al203 [28]. Regarding the effect of Pb addition on CO adsorption we have already shown [10,11] that it produces a significant change in IR band intensities; the high frequency band increases, and the low frequency band decreases. Therefore the presence of Pb favours the adsorption of linear CO and blocks the bonding of multiple coordinated CO. At first the main effect of Pb seems to be a simple dilution of the Pd atoms due to alloy formation. Here again some features of our TPD study are in line with those derived from FTIR experiments; the addition of 0.04% Pb to the 0.23% Pd catalysts enhanced the low temperature desorption profile with a parallel decrease in the high temperature peak. Accordingly the COJCOm ratio exhibits a large change, as shown in Table 4. However, in addition to changes in intensity, the TPD profile exhibits a shift in temperature, from 658 K to 721 K, upon alloying, which implies that the multiple coordinated species are more strongly adsorbed on the bimetallic catalyst. From IR studies it is well known that a downshift in frequency is observed as the CO coverage on transition metals decreases, a behaviour partially ascribed to a change in the dipole-dipole coupling effect. Another effect that plays an important role is a reduced competition for metal d electrons by the CO molecules, which in turn increases the extent of back-donation and the strength of the Me-C bond. On Pd-Pb [9,10] the adsorption of multiple coordinated CO is attenuated and shifted to lower frequencies. If a greater back-donation to empty CO 7r * orbitals takes place the correspondent desorp- tion peak may be expected at higher temperature. However the CO peak on Pd-Pb was shifted quite outside the range of CO desorption for the monometal- lic catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4b. Consequently the higher binding strength may be partly assigned to a ligand effect. For linear CO a downshift in frequency of about 25 cm-l, along with a very large increase in intensity, was also observed upon Pb addition [10,11]. This result cannot only be ascribed to a dilution of the surface Pd atoms [29] and represents an increase in bond strength due to an alteration of the electronic structure of Pd in the presence of Pb, that is to a ligand effect. However, our TPD profile in Pd-Pb (0.23-0.04%) does not show a clear peak upshift in the low temperature region. Despite the clear increase in intensity the desorption profile maintains a broad maximum in the 350-473 K temperature range, that is reduced to a single peak at 352 K for a very high Pb loading. Consequently the effect of Pb addition on the adsorption strength of linear CO cannot be demonstrated by a comparison of Pd and Pd-Pb TPD profiles. We suspect that CO readsorption is in fact increasing the peak temperatures in the monometallic catalyst. Certainly the effect of Pb on the CO desorption profile is much more pronounced than that of dispersion. When the amount of Pb added is high, as is 94 V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 81-96 the case of sample 7, only a small low temperature peak remains. Consequently, the effect of a large amount of Pb on CO adsorption is similar to that reported for H2, in the sense that it may suppress all adsorption forms. Another important feature of CO desorption is the high temperature formation of CO2. On the monometallic palladium catalyst it promotes the formation of CO2, which occurs via CO disproportionation, preferentially from multiple coordinated species as seen in Fig. 4a. Consequently, the modified catalysts did not show CO2 formation because the presence of Pb inhibits the adsorption and dissociation of CO, a process that is favoured by high temperature and signifi- cant electron transfer from the metal to the antibonding molecular orbitals. 4.4. Relevance to catalytic hydrogenation The modification of the adsorption properties of H2 and CO on Pd due to the presence of Pb may be used to explain the improved selectivity for partial hydrogenation reactions, as mentioned in the Introduction section. On the basis of the desorption spectra of H2 it is clear that the extent of hydrogen adsorption can be controlled by the Pb loading. Consequently, the reactions between hydrogen and adsorbed acetilenic, olefinic or diolefinic compounds will be moderated. On the other hand, taking into account that Pb blocks the adsorption of multiple coordinated CO, one can expect that dissociative processes leading to the formation of carbonaceous deposits, ethylidine species or self-hydrogena- tion reactions that are claimed to be responsible for the fall in selectivity [30], will be moderated due to the limited availability of contiguous adsorption sites. In fact, the role assigned to low levels of CO in commercial acetylene hydrogenation processes is to increase the overall selectivity by preventing the adsorption and hydrogenation of ethylene or the direct hydrogenation of acety- lene to ethane via ethylidine species. Therefore Pb is a promoter that enhances the beneficial effect of CO. One difference between CO and Pb is that the former promoter being mainly adsorbed on the strong multiple coordinated form, effectively blocks the adsorption of hydrogen on most Pd sites while the Pd-Pb alloy generates isolated sites. However, several H2 and CO chemisorp- tion measurements [10,16] and the present TPD results have shown that Pb also inhibits the dissociative adsorption of H2. Additional understanding of the role of Pb on selective hydrogenation requires a similar adsorption-desorption study of unsaturated hydrocarbons, taking into account that the self-hydrogenation of ethylene is an important process on Pd surfaces [31]. Further TPD studies are being carried out in this direction. 5. Conclusions Using palladium acetylacetonate as a chemical precursor, Pd/ce-A1203 cata- lysts of low metal content were prepared. Precatalyst reduction indicates that a V.H. Sandoval, C.E. Gigola /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996)81-96 95 fraction of Pd exhibits a strong interaction with the alumina support. The process occurs at a higher temperature than reduction of bulk PdO as Pd atoms are removed from the support octahedral sites according to the model of Lesage-Rosenberg [19]. Reduction treatments lead to particles in close associa- tion with the support. Upon reoxidation these particles stabilize the Pd as PdO 1.4. Several H2 adsorption states are observed on Pd/a-A1203, including a high temperature peak above 573 K. They may be assigned to hydrogen adsorbed on different metal sites and to subsurface hydrogen. The addition of Pb decreases the hydrogen adsorption capacity and this effect is more marked in adsorbed states with high substrate interaction. No peak shifts were observed indicating that the adsorption strength remains unaltered. On the Pd-Pb alloy the adsorption of CO changes from the favoured multiple coordinated strong form to the weak, linear form. The TPD profile does not show a peak shift for linear CO, but remnant multiple coordinated species desorb at higher temperature. This result has been discussed along with previous FTIR studies to support the existence of a partial ligand effect. Another important effect of Pb on CO desorption is the inhibition of CO2 formation. From the H2 and CO TPD results it is clear that progressive lead addition to Pd catalysts inhibits all adsorption processes that require an assembly of atoms, and this may explain the large increase in selectivity for hydrogenation of alkynes in the presence of alkenes when Pd-Pb catalysts are used.
