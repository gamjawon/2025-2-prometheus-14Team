Norway Received 5 September 1994; revised 5 December 1994: accepted 14 December 1994 Abstract Hydrothermally synthesized silicalite-I, [A1]-ZSM-5 and borosilicates with the MFI structure were subjected to several characterization techniques ( SEM, IR, BET, XRD, NMR, ICP and ion exchange measurements). It was confirmed that boron had entered the framework in the boron samples. In the protonated form the borosilicate catalyzed the alkylation of toluene by methanol and also the dehy- dration of methanol to hydrocarbons, though it was much less active than H- [All -ZSM-5 and showed markedly different selectivities. It was observed that whereas 98-99% of the methanol was converted to C2 hydrocarbons over H-[A1]-ZSM-5 the corresponding conversion over H-[B]-ZSM-5 was less than 0.2%.

Introduction Since the first synthesis of borosilicates with the MFI structure was reported [ 1 ], the catalytic properties of the' [ B ] -ZSM-5' have been discussed by several authors. In order to give rise to Br~nsted acidity in the [B]-ZSM-5 when protonated, the boron has to be in the catalyst framework. It has been stated that H-[ B ]-ZSM-5, due to the weaker acid strength of the Si-OH-B sites compared to the Si-OH-AI sites, is neither active in the alkylation of toluene by methanol nor in the dehydration of methanol to hydrocarbons [2,3]. Conflictingly, it has been claimed that the catalyst is active in both reactions [4]. Derewifiski et al., who used a pulse reactor, found a very small activity for transforming methanol to hydrocarbons, and a sizeable alkylation activity with high para-selectivity from a methanol/toluene mixture [5]. Other workers found that H-[B]-ZSM-5 was almost inactive in the Corresponding author. Fax. (+47) 22855441. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Kolboe /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 345-354 methanol reaction, while it catalyzed the alkylation of benzene with ethene fairly well [6]. Chu et al. carried out several reactions (not including alkylation of aromatics) and concluded that aluminum contaminations in the borosilicates were responsible for the entire activity of the catalysts [ 7 ]. At temperatures above 375, however, quantitative conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons over borosilicates with aluminum impurities 'below the detection limit' has been observed [ 8]. On this background we found it of interest to carry out a reinvestigation of the H- [ B ] - ZSM-5 system. 2. Experimental Silicalite-I, [ A1 ] -, [ A1,B ] - and [ B ] -ZSM-5 were synthesized hydrothermally (175) in teflon-lined stainless steel or pyrex autoclaves. Tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) was used as template. Silicon source and type of T3 ion in the synthesis gels are indicated in Table 1. In some of the syntheses (giving products FA, FB and FD) a seeding technique was utilized (seed = A, B and D, respectively). The seeding was used because we initially had difficulties obtaining a pure, crys- talline MFI product when the synthesis mixture contained much boron and little or no aluminum. The synthesis products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (diffuse reflection) infrared spectroscopy (IR), nitrogen adsorption (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), ~JB magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy ( ~B-MAS NMR), ion exchange measurements and elemental analyses by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP). The protonated forms were obtained by ion exchange of the carefully calcined zeolites (slow heating in air to 500) with an ammonium nitrate solution ( 1 M), followed by drying and calcining. In the case of sample BOR, an ammonia/ammonium buffer solution Table 1 Experimental and characterization parameters of MFI samples Sample Autoclave Si source T3+ added B/UCa AI/UC\" A Pyrex Waterglass None 1.1 1.6 B Pyrex Waterglass B3 + 1.0 1.7 C Pyrex Waterglass AI3 + 1.3 1,8 D Teflon Waterglass None < 0.05 0.2 E Teflon Ludox LS AI3 + < 0.05 2.0 FA Teflon Waterglass B3 2.8 0.3 FB Teflon Waterglass Ba + 2.7 0.6 FD Teflon Waterglass B3 + 3.

Analyses showed that a complete exchange of sodium ions by ammonium ions had taken place. Catalytic reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure at 210- 435 in a continuous flow quartz microreactor using toluene + methanol (in a molar ratio 2:1 ) or methanol as reactants and highly purified nitrogen as dilution gas. In the alkylation reaction the toluene partial pressure was approximately 0.5 bar, while the reactant pressure in the methanol dehydration was 40-160 mbar. Typical weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) were 4 h- t (alkylation) and 1 h- J (methanol reaction). The product stream was analyzed by gas chromatography. 3. Results and discussion In order to synthesize pure [ B ]-ZSM-5 catalysts, it was of great importance to avoid materials which would contaminate the synthesis mixtures with aluminum, as can be seen from the ICP elemental analysis results in Table 1. Syntheses performed in pyrex tubes gave [A1,B]-ZSM-5 as product (A, B and C). Further- more, the examples presented in Table 1 show that the silicon source tetraethoxy- silane (TEOS) was superior to waterglass with respect to yielding low aluminum content in the products. The XRD patterns showed the 'as synthesized' (TPA) products to be pure and highly crystalline MFI's with orthorhombic symmetry, though some of the products became monoclinic upon calcination. An example is shown for the borosilicate TPA-BOR (Fig. 1 ). The BET areas were ca. 370 m2/g for all calcined samples, and SEM confirmed the high crystallinity (well-shaped crystals, typically 10-20 /zm). XRD showed that the unit cell volumes of the [B]- and [A1,B]-ZSM-5's decreased almost linearly with increasing boron content (Fig. 2), indicating that boron was located at lattice positions [2,9-11 ]. It may be noted that samples A, C and FB which lie above the line all contain sizeable amounts of aluminum (Table 1 ). A high aluminum content is known to conduce to lattice expansion [ 9,10].

Unit cell volumes of borosilicates. unit cell contractions were caused by equal decreases of the unit cell axes as shown in Fig. 3, which also contains data from other MFI borosilicates. In addition, the H-[B]-ZSM-5's exhibited ion exchange properties, and the amount of acid sites found by those experiments correlated well with the ICP- determined boron content in the samples. It was found, however, that repeated ion exchanges of the H-[B]-ZSM-5 led to loss of boron from the lattice (Fig. 4). By ion exchanging the protonated forms of FA, FB, FD, G and BOR with sodium chloride, it was found that the number of H equivalents released from the samples was about 60% of the aluminum + boron determined by ICP analyses, and many times higher than the aluminum content. This result clearly indicates the presence of boron Brensted sites, most of them remaining after repeated ion exchange/ protonation (Fig. 4). l tB-MAS NMR measurements showed that the 'as synthesized' borosilicates contained boron in tetrahedral positions only (chemical shift = - 4 ppm referenced to BF3\"OEt2 [ 10,12-14] ). After subsequent ion exchange and protonation pro- cedures the samples still contained tetrahedral lattice boron, even though an addi- tional broad signal with a maximum at + 2 ppm appeared in the spectrum (Fig. 5 ). 20.1 H ............. 13./ __ ~ a o 20.0 ,, ~l.---J~ = 13.6 = \"~~ ~\" o~ 19.9 h ~ 13.5 ~ = 19.8 13.4 \"10 \"~240 5260 5280 5300 5320 5340 5360 Unit cell volume (A3) Fig. 3.

The latter chemical shift is close to the value reported by Ruiter et al. for trigonal boron ( + 5/- 1 ppm) [ 15], and our results correlate well with the observations of S cholle and Veeman for coexistence of trigonal and tetrahedral boron [ 14 ]. The reversible transition to trigonal boron [ 3 ] could be followed by NMR by heating the sample in dry atmosphere. By subsequent cooling to 20 in air tetrahedral boron reappeared (Fig. 6). A broad signal was also observed at ca. - 12 ppm, and it has been commented on by Scholle and Veeman to be due to the quadrupolar nature of the spectra [ 14]. A band at 915 cm ~ appeared in the IR spectrum of protonated borosilicate (BOR). This band was absent in the spectra of samples with no boron (Fig. 7a). +2 Ppm -4 ppm Protonated, Na exchanged and reorotonated ~~ed 4o2o .... 0 .... 2o-4o Chemical shift rel. to BF3OE~ (ppm) Fig. 5. ~IB-MAS NMR spectra of protonated BOR.

These bands indicate none, weak and strong BrCnsted acidity, respectively [2,181. The weak acidity of sample BOR was also confirmed by ammonia adsorption/ desorption. IR measurements showed that the remaining amount of adsorbed ammo- nia was close to zero at 200, while aluminum containing samples retained ammo- nia well above this temperature (to 400-500). In contrast to blank test runs, where no conversion of methanol took place ( < 0.02% at 370), formation of hydrocarbons could be observed at temperatures above 300 over sample BOR. The conversions were, however, much smaller than those over H-[ A1]- and H-[ AI,B ]-ZSM-5. Some data are presented in Table 2. The weaker acidity and catalytic activity of sample BOR were also illustrated by its rate of formation of dimethyl ether that was nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of comparable aluminum containing samples. H61derich et al. observed a high conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons above 375 [8]. They did not, however, quantify the aluminum content in their boro- silicate, though it was stated to be low. We found a much lower activity at these temperatures, but our experiments were performed at 40-160 mbar methanol pres- sure at constant carrier gas flow, whereas those of H61derich et al. were performed at various pressures up to 0.7 bar at constant WHSV. This difference in experimental conditions might explain part of the discrepancy. All in all our results are in better agreement with the findings of Chu et al. [ 7 ], although they concluded that boron does not contribute to catalyst activity. We have found the borosilicate (BOR) activity, although very low, to be significantly higher than that of sample SIL, the silicalite (Table 2). Thus it can be concluded that the activity of the borosilicate is caused by boron BrCnsted sites, and not by aluminum impurities, which were nearly completely absent. In addition to the great difference in activity, the hydrocarbon selectivities over the boron and the aluminum containing samples were markedly different. While 352 E. Unneberg, S.

WHSV (toluene) : 3.6 h- ~. mainly ethene and propene were formed over the aluminum containing zeolites, methane was the dominating hydrocarbon over borosilicates. At similar experi- mental conditions, less than 0.2% of the methanol was converted to C2hydrocar- bons over sample BOR, while 98-99% of the methanol formed C2+ over H-[A1]-ZSM-5 (Table 2). In addition, IR analyses of our product stream over sample BOR revealed that carbon monoxide was produced in about the same amount as methane. Although the carbon monoxide formation rate is extremely low at temperatures below 400 this finding is somewhat surprising, as there are no impurities of substances known to catalyze decomposition of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. All synthesis mixtures were prepared in polypropylene vessels, and no metal or glass laboratory equipment were in contact with the gels during preparation. During these experiments there was no metal in the reactor. The thermocouple normally present to measure temperature in the catalyst bed was removed. However, the presence of carbon monoxide, which implies that hydrogen was also present, may explain why the catalyst activity remained fairly constant with time on stream. Methane could be formed without a simultaneous coke for- mation, as indicated by the observation that the colour of sample BOR stayed white during the experiments (lasting up to 50 h). This result is in contrast to the change of colour of H-[A1]-ZSM-5, which turned from white to grey or black during similar experimental conditions. The conversion of toluene when alkylated by methanol at 435 over H-[B ]- ZSM-5 was an order of magnitude lower than the conversion over H-[A1]-ZSM- 5. About 2% of the toluene was alkylated, somewhat depending on the time on stream as the catalyst deactivated to some extent during the first hours of the experiment (Fig. 8). The activity was, however, reestablished by reactivation in oxygen at 480, indicating that boron framework sites were not destroyed. Over the catalyst BOR no other alkylation products than xylenes, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and durene could be detected (a typical molar distribution was 85/12/3). Also over H-[A1]-ZSM-5 the xylene isomers constituted the main product, but para- ethyltoluene was the dominant C9 component, possibly due to alkylation of toluene with ethene (formed from methanol) or formed from methanol as an 'initial' E.

Due to the low activity for hydrocarbon formation from methanol, H-[ B ]-ZSM-5 borosilicate might have a potential as alkylation catalyst. Over H-[ B ]-ZSM-5, the xylene distribution in the alkylation reaction remained nearly constant during a 9 h experiment. A typical ortho-/meta-/para-xylene ratio was 38/25/37 (Fig. 9). This selectivity is in contrast to results we have obtained using H-[A1]-ZSM-5 and to literature results on catalysts with the MFI structure where the ortho-xylene selectivity usually is much lower. However, in another study on the H-[ B ] -ZSM-5 system, where a micro pulse reactor was used, a meta- xylene/ortho-xylene ratio less than unity is reported, but at the same time a high para-selectivity was observed [ 5 ]. The relatively high ortho-xylene concentration in our product mixtures indicates that the ortho-para directing effect of the methyl group in toluene is not cancelled by steric restrictions in H-[B]-ZSM-5. 4. Conclusion Pure [B]-MFI has been synthesized and boron has been proved to exist in both trigonal and tetrahedral lattice positions, giving rise to (weak) Br0nsted acidity. The activity of this catalyst in the methanol reaction is very poor compared to H- [ A1 ] -ZSM-5, but it is larger than that of silicalite-I. In the reaction between toluene and methanol the selectivity to alkylation was high, preferentially in the ortho and para positions. The H-[ B ]-ZSM-5 catalyst might have a potential as an alkylation catalyst, though the activity is low.

In the protonated from the borosilicate catalyzed the alkylation of toluene by methanol and also the dehydration of methanol to hydrocarbons, though it was much less active than H-[Al]-ZSM-5 and showed markedly different selectivities. It was observed that whereas 98–99% of the methanol was converted to C2+ hydrocarbons over H-[Al]-ZSM-5 the corresponding conversion over H-[B]-ZSM-5 was less than 0.2%.
