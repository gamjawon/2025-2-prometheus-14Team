Choudary*, M. Ravichandra Sarma and K. Vijaya Kumar Homogeneous Catalysis, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received September 10,1992; accepted August 17,1993) Abstract High para-selectivity (upto 92%) and isolated yield (90%) are achieved in the nitration of chlorobenzene catalysed by Fe\"-exchanged K10-montmorillonite in the presence of a mixture of fuming nitric acid-acetic anhydride as nitrating agent. Key words: chlorobenzene; iron; montmorillonite; nitration Introduction Mononitrohalobenzenes, especially para-nitrochlorobenzenes, are versatile intermediates for dyes, pharmaceuticals and perfumes [ 1 ] . Aromatic nitrations are classically performed with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids giving predominantly ortho- and para-products close to the thermodynamic ratio of 1: 2 [ 2, 3 ] . However, a mixture of acetic anhydride and nitric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid was used by Menke [4] and Paul [5] and afforded high para-selectivity at low temperature. Recently, attention has been focused on the development of environmentally friendly solid acid catalysts, especially in Friedel-Crafts reactions, to replace anhydrous aluminium chloride [6] and sulfuric acid, which are serious environmental pollutants, in alkylation and nitration reactions, respectively. Environmentally safe catalysts developed for alkylations have been very successful, while success has remained elusive in the nitration reactions. Long reaction times and moderate yields are the major disadvantages in the nitration of halobenzene carried out by Laszlo and Dennetreau [ 7 ] on clay COP (copper nitrate impregnated montmorillonite), whereas low para-selectivity in the nitration of chlorobenzene was obtained by Olah et al. [8] using Nafion-H as a catalyst. Cyclodegtrins have been used to encapsulate organic substrates in an auxiliary inclusion compound in order to block the ortho attack and obtain higher para-selectivity *Corresponding author.

K10-montmorillonite, an acid activated montmorillonite, has been chosen as support because its layered structure could offer similar selectivities as for example, in the para-selective hydrogenation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene to 4-amino, 2-nitrotoluene [ 10 ] as has been observed with cyclodextrins. We report here a better approach to the achievement of high para-selectivity (up to 92%) and isolated yield (90%) using a Fe\"-exchanged K10montmorillonite as a catalyst and a mixture of fuming nitric acid-acetic anhydride as a nitrating agent (Scheme 1) . The recycling ability of the catalyst is also demonstrated to be very efficient. Results and discussion Nitration of chlorobenzene with various catalytic systems has been studied as a part of our work on the development of an efficient catalytic process for producing p-nitrochlorobenzene. It is known that the Friedel-Crafts alkylation proceeds both on Bronsted and Lewis acid sites [ 11 ] . The acid strength of acid-treated montmorillonite (which is usually called K10-montmorillonite) corresponds to a Hammett acidity function (Ho) value of - 3.7 [ 12 ] . With this understanding, K10-montmorillonite is used as catalyst/support for nitration of halobenzene in our studies. As can be seen from Table 1, the nitration of chlorobenzene was initially performed with K10-montmorillonite as supplied by Fluka. An impressive para-selectivity was obtained, with only moderate isolated yield. When the reaction was conducted with a freshly prepared H+-montmorillonite obtained by treating K10-montmorillonite with 0.1 M HCl to eliminate metal impurities, the Ora-selectivity and yields were lower than with K10-montmorillonite. The higher yield and selectivity with K10montmorillonite may possibly be due to the presence of some lattice iron which, upon acid treatment, migrates towards the exchange position [ 13 ] . In fact, the Fe\" content was found to be 0.19% by colorimetric analysis. This prompted us to use iron-exchanged montmorillonite [Fe\" content 2.44% ] which, under identical conditions, displayed a better para-selectivity (87%) and activity (83% isolated yield), even at room temperature. At 80 C the para-selectivity reached 92% with 90% isolated yield ofp-nitrochlorobenzene. It should be noted that the improved para-selectivity with the increase of temperature with this catalytic system conflicts with the observation of Laszlo and Dennetreau [ 7 ] B.M.

Both FriedelCrafts alkylation and nitration are electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Lewis acids are widely used as reagents or catalysts for induction of these reactions. K10-montmorillonite, predominantly H+-exchanged, gave higher para-selectivity than conventional homogeneous reactions [ 2, 3 ] . With the enhanced Lewis acidity obtained from exchange of Fe 31 cations in montmorillonite, the Fe\" -K10-montmorillonite displays enhanced selectivity and activity. This increase of activity with Fe content is consistent with the results reported recently, that activity in Friedel-Crafts alkylation increases with Fe content in vermiculite [ 11 ] . All these interesting observations seem to indicate that the nitration reaction takes place in montmorillonite and is catalysed by the exchanged Fe\", and also the easy accessibility of the external NO' from the para-position, coupled with a greater stabilization of the p-arenium ions in montmorillonite, enhances thepara-selectivity. The enhancedpara-selectivity with the increase of the temperature in the present case is due to the increased nitration activity of Fe\". The nitration reactions were conducted with different amounts of Fe3+K10-montmorillonite (Fig. 1). The para-selectivities and isolated yields increase with increasing amounts of catalyst. However, the optimum amount of catalyst required for achieving high para-selectivity and isolated yield is 1 g. The catalyst was found to be efficient even upon reuse for five recycles, exhibiting constant high para-selectivity and activity (entries 5 and 6 of Table 1). When bromobenzene and iodobenzene were subjected to nitration (Table 36 B.M. Choudary et al. / J. Mol.

Experimental The structural assignment of the reaction products was carried out by spectral analysis. The reaction was followed by gas chromatography. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Gemini (200 MHz) NMR spectrometer B.M. Choudary et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 33-38 37 using tetramethylsilane as internal standard. GC analyses were carried out on a Sigma gas chromatograph with a 2-m-long column packed with SE 30. Materials K10-montmorillonite obtained from Fluka was used directly without any pretreatment. Chlorobenzene and bromobenzene (from Ranbagy) and iodobenzene (from E-Merk) were used without any further purification. Experimental Fe'-K10-montmorillonite catalyst The catalyst was prepared according to procedure reported by Laszlo and Mathy [ 14 ] . To 11 of a stirred aqueous solution (1 M) of FeCl3 was added 80 g of K10 clay. Stirring was maintained for 24 h. The clay suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant solution was discarded. The clay catalyst was washed with distilled water and the washing cycles were repeated until Clions had disappeared from the discarded water. The clay was dried overnight in an oven at 120 C and finely ground in a mortar. The~Fe3+ content was measured by a colorimetric method and found to be 2.44% by weight. Preparation of H+-montmorillonite Na+-montmorillonite was prepared by suspending K10-montmorillonite in an excess of saturated aqueous NaCl solution for 24 h. The sodium-exchanged clay was then separated by centrifugation and washed free of chlorides with deionised water as indicated by the AgN03 test. It was finally dried in air. Na+-montmorillonite was treated with 0.1-0.2 M HCl and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The H+-montmorillonite thus obtained was thoroughly washed with deionised water, centrifuged and vacuum dried below 80'C for about 6-10 h to remove part of its interlayer water. Nitration procedure A mixture of chlorobenzene (0.56 g, 5 mmol), acetic anhydride (1.6 ml, 15.6 mmol), Fe\"-K10-montmorillonite catalyst [1 g, 2.44% Fe (0.43 mmol); catalyst: substrate =1:10 ] in carbon tetrachloride solvent was stirred in a 25 ml two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, an upright condenser and a CaC12 guard tube against humidity. Fuming nitric acid (0.25 ml, 5.5 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 C. The disappearance of chlorobenzene was followed by GC. The completion of the reaction can be seen in Table 1. Later on, the catalyst was filtered and the organic layer was washed with water to remove the 38 B. M. ChouOry et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 87 (1994) 33-38 acetic acid. The organic layer was concentrated under vacuum to obtain the pure mononitrochlorobenzene (0.63 g, 90% ). The'H-NMR analyses gave 92% of 4-nitrochlorobenzene and 8% of 2-nitrochlorobenzene. Conclusion In conclusion, the use of solid acid catalyst is most advantageous in view of obtaining high Ora-selectivity and yield, even at high temperature. It turns out to be especially useful for industry since it is an environmentally friendly process. Acknowledgements We thank Dr. AN. Rams Rao for his keen interest and encouragement.
