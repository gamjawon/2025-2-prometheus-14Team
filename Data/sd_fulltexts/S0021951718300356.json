Graphical abstract Developing high performance and low cost non-precious metal based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for a wide range of industrial applications of fuel cells. Here, we report the catalytic performance of a novel cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS catalysts for ORR. Both the NiS2 and NiS are synthesized by facile one-pot hydrothermal method and exhibit a high level of purity. Compared to conventional Pt/C catalysts, the NiS2 catalyst yields a higher peak current intensity and enhanced long time running stability despite the half wave potential is 40 mV lower than that of Pt/C catalyst. Rotating disc electrode tests show that the NiS2 catalyzes ORR mainly happening through 4-electron pathway. Thus, the NiS catalyzes ORR happening through 2-electron pathway. We envision that the NiS2 catalyst has great potential to be alternate for the Pt/C catalyst for ORR in alkaline fuel cells. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Catalyst NiS2 Electrocatalysis Electron transfer number 1 Introduction Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a complex 4-electron reaction involving the breaking of a double bond of oxygen molecular and the formation of 4 OH-bonds, represents the electrochemical process that bottlenecks the performance of fuel cells. The state of the art catalysts for ORR in fuel cells are normally based on precious metals, which exhibit high activity, selectivity and stability under various reaction conditions [1,2]. However, the ever-increasing demand in the catalysts and the limited availability of these precious metals as well as the easily poisoned are pushing the development of novel alternative catalysts, which are cost effective, green and high yield. To eliminate the severe dependence on the precious metals, non-precious metal based catalysts, such as transition metal carbides, metal oxides, carbon-based materials, have recently emerged [3–7]. Fe-carbon nitride and carbon-nitride based catalysts as promising catalysts for ORR had ever been reported [8,9]. On the other hand, the Ni5P4 based catalyst also had been reported as high performance catalyst for novel energy [10]. Recently, the electrocatalytic performance of CoS2 thin films for ORR has ever been reported and the electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the enrichment of S atoms at the surface [11]. Nickel as well as its alloys has been exploited as catalysts for ORR owing to its good catalytic activity, easy decoration with other elements, and facile changing valence [12–15]. For example, NiS and NiS/Ni3S4 hybrids fabricated on stainless steel meshes have been developed as catalysts for ORR in the non-aqueous lithium-air batteries. However, owing to the mutable characteristics of nickel-sulfur as well as the complicated working solution, it remains a formidable challenge to synthesize compounds with high purity and superior performances. To obtain high purity nickel sulfide, nickel was employed to react with thioacetamide directly. But the efficiency of this method should be improved [16]. Herein, we develop a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize the cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS with high purity for ORR. Through the controlling of sulfur sources, we achieved the desirous NiS2 and NiS with remarkable purity. The synthesized NiS2 shows a high catalytic performance for ORR and long time running stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the catalytic characteristics of NiS2 for ORR in alkaline electrolyte. Our results clearly indicate that the metal disulphide based materials have great potential to be high-performance catalysts for ORR of alkaline electrolyte. The application of NiS2 catalyst will promote the development of alkaline fuel cells and other new energy sources with high performance and low cost despite that there are still some technical obstacles to overcome for alkaline fuel cells. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Fabrication of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS catalysts We synthesized cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS using a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. Briefly, 2.62 g nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O) and 2.48 g sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) were dissolved into 50 ml water and 30 ml ethylene glycol solution. Then 0.2 g high-purity sulfur powder was added into the solution. The mixture was moved into a 100 ml Teflon centrality sealed by stainless cylinder and kept at 160 °C for 24 h. The obtained precipitate was washed with CS2 reagent to remove the residue sulfur powder. And then the residuum was washed with water and ethanol. Finally, a black powder was obtained and fully dried at 60 °C by vacuum oven. The reaction of the synthesis process of NiS2, which is schematically drawn in Fig. 1 , can be written as: Ni 2 + + S 2 O 3 2 - + S → 160 ° C NiS 2 + SO 3 As a control experiment, we also synthesized graphene supported hexagonal NiS using the similar method as discussed above. Here the graphene oxide was first prepared using modified Hummer’s method and adopted as the precursor of graphene [17]. 2.62 g nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O) and 0.76 g thiourea were dissolved into the solution of 50 ml water and 30 ml ethylene glycol. Then 1 ml graphene oxide solution with the intensity of 6 g/l was mixed and sonicated for 30 min. The obtained brown solution was moved into a 100 ml Teflon centrality sealed by stainless cylinder and also kept at 160 °C for 24 h. The obtained precipitate was thoroughly washed with water and ethanol. The chemical reaction of the synthesis of NiS is also chemically drawn in Fig. 1 and the formula can be expressed as: Ni 2 + + SC ( NH 2 ) 2 + 2 H 2 O → 160 ° C NiS + CO 2 + 2 NH 4 + The obtained materials are usually fully dried and kept in argon atmosphere to prevent possible oxidation. 2.2 Materials characterization A Bruker D8-advance X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) was employed for X-ray diffraction (XRD) test. The morphology and the elemental mapping of the catalysts were examined by using a Hitachi (S-4800) scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyzer. A Tecnai 20 U-TWIN instrument was employed to test the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. The accelerating voltage of the equipment for test was 200 kV. A Perkin Elmer PHI5300 spectrometer with monochromatized Mg Kα radiation was employed to detect the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the catalysts. The Raman spectra of NiS2 and NiS were collected by using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer with 532 nm laser excitation. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb gas-sorption system to determine the specific surface area of NiS and NiS2. 0.5 g catalyst was weight and set in the long-neck flask of the equipment. Then the flask with catalyst was heated to 350 °C and degassed for 2 h. After that the catalyst and the flask were cooling down to ambient temperature and dipped into liquid nitrogen. The test was begun and the data of the pressure and the amount of absorbed nitrogen gas were recorded. When the test finished, the data were collected and dealt with the specific software. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization We characterized the electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized materials using three electrodes CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. The saturated Hg/Hg2Cl2, a carbon electrode with the diameter of 5 mm and a glassy carbon electrode with the diameter of 3 mm were adopted as reference electrode, counter-electrode and working electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.1 M KOH solution. The working electrode was prepared as the following procedure. First, 3.0 mg catalyst was weighted and mixed with 50 μl Nafion solution (Aldrich, 5% in aliphatic alcohols) and 450 μl DI water. Then the mixture was sonicated for 40 min. 5.0 μl of the sonicated suspension was pipetted and dropped onto a glassy-carbon electrode, which had been polished to a mirror surface, and fully washed and dried. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests of the working electrode were first conducted in the argon saturated electrolyte to remove the unstable materials, such as physical adsorbed oxygen and micro amount of small organic molecular of the Nafion solution, on the electrode. Then the CV tests of the working electrode were conducted in oxygen saturated electrolyte between 0.2 and −0.8 V versus Hg/Hg2Cl2 with the sweeping rates of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mV/s and the results were recorded, respectively. The linearly sweeping voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel tests were also conducted in oxygen saturated electrolyte at the sweeping rate of 5 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out from 0.1 to 105 Hz at a half wave potential, which is determined by the CV test. The long-time running stability was evaluated by two kinds of methods. One was conducted by 400 continuous CV cycles. Another method was current-time tests, which was conducted at half wave potential and standing 3600 s running with the sweeping rate of 50 mV/s. The rotating disc electrode (RDE) tests were carried out on a RRDE-3A rotating ring disc electrode combined with CHI 760E. The RDE tests were recorded with the sweeping rate of 5 mV/s at different rotating speeds. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS We first characterized the morphological and structural features of the as-synthesized NiS2 catalysts using TEM tests. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the NiS2 shows a cubic-like structure and the average size of NiS2 is measured to be about 100 nm. The inset in Fig. 2a is the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) test of NiS2. The bright parallel point line pattern of SAED confirms the cubic structure of NiS2 [18]. Fig. S1 (Supplementary Materials), the low magnification of TEM tests, also illustrates the cubic structure of NiS2. Fig. 2b shows the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) of NiS2. Based on the HRTEM measurements, it is detected that the crystal lattice distance is 0.536 nm, which is corresponding to the (1 0 0) facet of NiS2. This also proves the successful synthesis of cubic NiS2. On the other hand, there is no other phases detected, which means that no other kind of metal-sulfide was formed during the synthesis process. The synthesized NiS2 has a high purity. The catalytic performance of catalysts are great influenced by the morphology [19]. The morphologies of the as-prepared catalysts were also examined by using SEM. Fig. 2c shows the SEM image of the NiS2, which displays a stacked cubic-like structure. The stacked structure is attributed to the aggregation of small cubic particles of NiS2. To further investigate the structure of NiS2, the corresponding elemental mapping and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) tests of NiS2 were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S2 (Supplementary Materials). As shown in Fig. S2, the NiS2 showed an aggregated cubic-like structure. On the other hand, it is also clearly observed in the elemental mapping that the distributions of nickel and sulfur are consistent with each other, which proves the successful synthesis of cubic NiS2. Clearly, it is also shown in the EDS that the intensity of the signal of nickel and sulfur are much stronger than that of carbon. The signal of carbon should be attributed to the trace residue of ethylene glycol or its ramification. Similarly, the signal of silicon in the EDS comes from the substrate of the tests. By contrast, we also characterized the physical structure of NiS by using SEM, TEM and HRTEM measurements. As shown in Fig. 2d, the SEM measurement of NiS reveals that NiS shows an aggregated sheet-like structure. Previously, similar sheet-like structure has been reported [20]. Liu et al. also found the aggregation of NiS2 and NiS in their researches [21]. The corresponding elemental mapping and EDS tests of NiS are showed in Fig. S3 (Supplementary Materials). The results also confirm the successful synthesis of NiS. Fig. 2e clearly reveals that the NiS particles with the size ranged from 20 to 60 nm are evenly distributed on graphene sheet. The inset of Fig. 2e is the corresponding SAED of NiS, which also illustrates the hexagonal structure of NiS. The HRTEM of Fig. 2f shows that the crystal lattice distance is 0.259 nm, which is corresponding to the (1 0 1) facet of NiS. Thus, the (0 0 2) facet is detected in the research of NiS-PPy-CNF film as cathodes of lithium batteries [22]. The inset in Fig. 2f is the Fluorine Transfer (FT) tests of NiS. The hexagonal style of FT clarifies that the NiS has a smooth surface with hexagonal micro-structure. To further investigate the structure and purity of the synthesized NiS2 and NiS, we measured the XRD patterns of NiS2 and NiS, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 3 a, the major peaks are corresponding to different peaks of NiS and NiS2, respectively. The indexed Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) number of NiS2 and NiS are 65-3325 and 65-0830, respectively. Based on the XRD tests, the crystal cell parameters of each catalyst were calculated by software Jade. The calculated crystal cell parameter a of NiS2 is 0.5385 nm and the corresponding space group is Pa-3(205). The indexed cubic structure of NiS2 is consistent with the results of SEM and TEM tests. The calculated a and c of hexagonal NiS are 0.3416 nm and 0.5300 nm, respectively. The corresponding space group of NiS is P6 3/mmc. The hexagonal structure of NiS is benefit to the formation of sheet-like 2-dimensional structure. The existence of graphene also promotes the formation of nanosheet-like structure [23]. Pan et al. also reported the recrystallization of NiS nanorods to nanosheets, which clarified the formation of sheet-like morphology of NiS [24]. On the other hand, there is no other phases were indexed by the XRD tests, which proves the high purity of the synthesized cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS catalysts. Fig. 3b shows the Raman tests of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS. The typical D and G peaks of carbon of NiS2 centering at 1323 and 1585 cm−1 should be attributed to the carbon of trace residue of ethylene glycol or its ramification [25,26]. The Raman spectra style of NiS is quite different from that of the normal style of graphene. The peak that centers the wave-number 1412 cm−1 should be attributed to the interaction of the graphene and the hexagonal NiS nano-sheet [27]. The Raman spectra of metal sulfides and that of graphene overlapped in the test range, which proves that the hexagonal NiS and graphene make influences on each other. The specific surface area tests of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS are supplied in Figs. S4a and S4b (Supplementary Materials), separately. The hexagonal NiS showed a higher specific surface area than the cubic NiS2. The larger specific surface area of NiS should be attributed to the existence of graphene. We also conduct X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to examine the compositions of NiS2 and NiS. As shown in Fig. 3c, the XPS of NiS2 and NiS reveal the co-existence of Ni, S and C. The signal of carbon of NiS comes from the graphene support and the common contamination such as CO2 from atmosphere. Fig. 3d and e shows the combining states of S 2p of NiS2 and NiS, separately. The S 2p and SNi bonds are detected in the XPS of sulfur of both NiS2 and NiS catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3d, the SS bond is only deconvoluted from the XPS of S 2p of NiS2, which confirms the successful synthesis of NiS2. Fig. 3f shows the typical combining state of nickel in NiS and NiS2. The typical combining bonds of Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p1/2 and NiS bond are deconvoluted [28,29]. The deconvoluted high resolution XPS of NiS bond of Ni 2p and the SNi bond of S 2p prove the successful synthesis of NiS and NiS2 [30]. The binding energy of S 2p and Ni 2p peaks have some difference with that of the reported results, which should be attributed to the different structures [31]. The binding energy and peak intensity are influenced by the environmental atoms. It is well known that micro amount of impurities can make great influences on the catalytic performances of catalysts. Combined with the XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS tests and considering the preparation procedure, it can be deduced that the synthesized NiS and NiS2 should have high impurities. 3.2 Electrochemical characterization of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS To investigate the electro-catalytic performance, we first investigated the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests of NiS2 and NiS and the results are shown in Fig. 4 a. The CV tests of both catalysts are conducted in both argon and oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. All the data were collected at the sweeping rate of 50 mV/s. The CV curves of both cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS in argon saturated 0.1 M KOH are smooth, which mean that the structures of the two catalysts can keep stable during the tests [32]. The CV curves of both catalysts in the oxygen saturated electrolyte at the sweeping rate of 5 mV/s show obvious peaks, which should be attributed to the ORR on the catalysts. Comparison of the CV tests of NiS2 and NiS shows that the peak current intensity of NiS2 is much stronger than that of hexagonal NiS. Simultaneously, it is also revealed that the onset potential, which means the potential of initial happening of ORR, of NiS2 catalyzed ORR is more positive than that of NiS. The catalytic performance of NiS had ever been reported in the research on lithium-air battery system [33]. The two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, NiS, etc. are believed to have great potential to be high performance catalysts for energy conversion [34]. The more positive onset potential and higher current intensity prove that the catalytic performance of NiS2 is higher than that of NiS. The higher catalytic performance of NiS2 should be attributed to the different structures of the catalysts. Considering the investigations on the structure of NiS and NiS2, the higher catalytic performance should be attributed to the SS bond of NiS2. The SS bond of S2 2− ion has higher electron density than the single S2− ion, which can provide more electrons during the reaction of oxygen reduction. The effect of SS bond of S2 2− ion on the catalytic performance for ORR will be discussed with the catalytic mechanism of NiS2. Researches on the catalytic performance of CoS2 for ORR attributed the enhanced catalytic performance to the enriched sulfur atoms on the surface [11]. The differences of the onset potential and peak current intensity are also observed in the linear sweeping voltammetry (LSV) tests as shown in Fig. 4b. As reference, the LSV test of Pt/C catalyst is also supplied. It is clearly shown that the peak current intensity of NiS2 is higher than that of Pt/C catalyst. Compared with NiS2, the oxygen reduction current intensity of hexagonal NiS is fairly weaker. It is also observed that the half wave potential of NiS2 is just 40 mV lower than that of Pt/C catalyst. The half wave potential is defined as the potential that is corresponding to the half intensity of the peak current. Fig. S5 (Supplementary Materials) shows the CV tests of NiS2 and NiS at different sweeping rates in the oxygen saturated electrolyte. Figs. S5a and S5c reveal that the current intensities of both catalysts increase with increasing sweeping rates. Figs. S5b and 5d show that the peak current intensity linearly increases with the increase of the square root of sweeping rates, which means that the ORR on the catalyst surface is an oxygen diffusion controlled process [35]. To evaluate the polarization of ORR on the catalysts, the electro-catalytic performance of NiS2 and NiS were investigated by Tafel tests. The Tafel tests of both NiS2 and NiS are shown in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4c shows that the Tafel slope of NiS2 is lower than that of NiS, which illustrates that NiS2 catalyzed ORR could be conducted in a lower polarization state. The results of Tafel tests are consistent with the results of CV tests. The Tafel test of Pt/C catalyst was also supplied. It could be seen that the Tafel slope of Pt/C catalyzed ORR is even above the double times higher than that of NiS and NiS2, which means that the polarization of NiS and NIS2 catalyzed ORR is weaker than that of Pt/C catalyst. Based on the Tafel tests, the exchange current intensity and electron transfer coefficient are calculated according to the Tafel equation [36]. (1) η = a + b lg i = - RT α nF log i 0 + RT α nF log i where η is the overpotential of polarization for ORR, b is the Tafel slope, R is the gas constant 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is the test temperature in K, F is Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), n is reaction electron number, α is electron transfer coefficient and i 0 is the exchange current intensity. The obtained α and i 0 of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS are shown in Table S1 (Supplementary Materials). As comparison, the onset potentials (E 0) and peak current intensities (Ip ) at the sweeping rate of 0.005 V/s are also supplied. It could be seen that the exchange current intensity of NiS2 is almost the same with that of Pt/C catalyst. The electron transfer coefficient of the NiS2 is also quite approach to that of Pt/C catalyst, which means that NiS2 has excellent catalytic performance for ORR. Another important performance for electrocatalysts is the long time running stability. The long time running stability is usually evaluated by continuous cyclic voltammetry tests or current-time chronoamperometric tests. Fig. 4d illustrates the 1st, 200th and 400th cycles of the continuous CV tests of cubic NiS2. The current intensity decreases about 20% after continuous running 400 CV cycles, which means that the catalytic stability of NiS2 for ORR is fairly good. The decrease of the peak current intensity could be attributed to the decreased oxygen intensity of electrolyte. The cyclic tests of Pt/C catalyst is also supplied in Fig. S6a (Supplementary Materials). It is clearly showed that with the cyclic test going on the peak current intensity of ORR also decreased. After 400 cycle tests, the peak current intensity of ORR decreased about 40%. This also demonstrates the high long-time running stability of NiS2 catalyst. The current-time chronoamperometric tests of NiS2 and NiS are illustrated in Fig. S6b (Supplementary Materials). The test of Pt/C catalyst is also supplied, simultaneously. It is distinctly observed that the current intensity of NiS2 is much higher than that of NiS and Pt/C catalysts. The current intensity of NiS2 almost no changes could be found with the time going on. But the current intensity of hexagonal NiS greatly decreased at the same time. The long time running stability of cubic NiS2 is also much better than that of hexagonal NiS and Pt/C catalyst. The difference of long time running stability should be attributed to the different structures. The sulfur-sulfur bond of NiS2 improves the long-time running stability of NiS2 for catalyzing ORR. To elucidate the catalytic mechanism of NiS and NiS2 for ORR, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were conducted and the results are showed in Fig. 4e and f, separately. The results were modulated by the ZSimpWin software. The insets in Fig. 4e and f are the modulated equivalent circuits of ORR. The two reaction impedance R2 and R3 of the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4e implies that the ORR should be happened through two reactions with the catalysis of NiS. Thus, the single reaction impedance R2 of Fig. 4f implies that the ORR should be happened only through one reaction with the catalysis of NiS2. Further explanation will be discussed with the rotating disc electrode (RDE) tests. 3.3 RDE tests of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS for ORR To further investigate the catalytic mechanism of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS for ORR, RDE tests are conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 5 a and b, separately. Both Fig. 5a and b shows that, to each catalyst, the current intensity of ORR increases with increasing rotating speeds of electrode, which should be attributed to the enhanced oxygen diffusion on the electrode surface [37]. Comparison of Fig. 5a and b shows that the current intensity of NiS2 is much higher than that of hexagonal NiS at the same rotating speed, which is consistent with the CV test results. This should be attributed to that the catalytic activity of NiS2 is higher than that of hexagonal NiS. Fig. 5c and d shows the calculations of electron transfer number according to the Koutechy-Levich (K-L) Eq. (2) [38,39]: (2) 1 J = 1 J L + 1 J K = 1 B ω 1 / 2 + 1 J K Here, J is the measured current intensity. JK is kinetic current density and JL is the diffusion limiting current densities. The angular frequency ω is the rotating speed with the unit of rpm. From K-L equation, B, the slope of K-L line will be written as following Eq. (3): (3) B = 0.2 nFC 0 ( D 0 ) 2 / 3 ϑ - 1 / 6 where n is the electron transfer number, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), D 0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in the electrolyte, ϑ is the kinematic viscosity, and C 0 is the bulk concentration of O2 in the solution. The calculated electron transfer numbers of the catalysts at different potential are shown in Fig. 5c and d. It is clearly proved that the ORR under the catalysis of NiS2 mainly happens through 4-electron pathway. Thus, the ORR mainly happens through 2-electron pathway with the catalysis of hexagonal NiS. This also explains why two reactions could be deduced by the EIS tests of NiS. Similar results were also observed in the research on Co-based catalyst for ORR [40]. As comparison, the RDE tests of Pt/C catalyzed ORR were also conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 5e and f. It is clearly observed that the ORR major happened through 4-electron pathway. The performance of NiS2 showed similar catalytic activity to Pt/C catalyst. This also demonstrates the high catalytic activity of NiS2 for ORR. The reaction resistant R2 in Fig. 4e is corresponding to the mixed 4-electron and the first step of 2-electron reactions and R3 is corresponding to the second step of 2-electron reduction reaction of H2O2 (the intermediate of 2-electron reaction). Similar results were also deduced in the research on the catalytic characteristics of nitrogen doped carbon materials for ORR [41]. Thus, the R2 in Fig. 4f is just corresponding to the 4-electron reaction pathway of ORR. The possible reactions of ORR are as followings [42]: (4) 4 -electron reaction : 2 H 2 O + O 2 + 4 e - → 4 OH - (5) 2 -electron reactions : 2 H 2 O + O 2 + 2 e - → 2 OH - + H 2 O 2 ( first step ) (6) H 2 O 2 + 2 e - → 2 OH - ( second step ) The ORR major happened through 4-electron pathway with the catalysis of NiS2, thus the NiS catalyzed ORR major happened through 2-electron pathway. Based on the RDE tests, the deduced catalytic mechanism of oxygen reaction with the catalysis of NiS2 and NiS are showed in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6a shows that two nickel atoms of NiS2 first connected with the oxygen atom of H2O molecules. Two neighboring H2O molecules connect with one oxygen molecules through two hydrogen bonds. The nickel ions of NiS2 crystal are firstly combined by water of the electrolyte, which prevent the direct connection of oxygen molecular to nickel ions in space. So the oxygen molecular of the electrolyte is preferentially combined with the hydrogen atoms of water through hydrogen bond and form the H2O-O2-H2O complex structure. The SS bond of S2 − ions of NiS2 provides electrons to the hydrogen bonds of connected H2O-O2-H2O complex. Then the connected H2O-O2-H2O complex obtains 4 electrons and forms four OH− ions at one step. This is the 4-electron reaction pathway of ORR. The SS bond of S2 2− ion of NiS2 played the role of catalytic active center. Researches on the sulfur doped graphene-carbon nano-tube composite also proved that the doped sulfur played the role of catalytic active center for oxygen reduction [43]. Fig. 6b shows the mechanism of oxygen reduction with the catalysis of NiS. It could be seen that only one sulfur ion make influences, that is, providing electrons, on the oxygen molecule of the complex of H2O-O2-H2O. The S2− ion has not enough electrons to be provided for the full reduction of oxygen molecule, which eventually results in the ORR major happening through 2-electron pathway. The sulfur atoms that combined with metal atoms played the role of catalytic active center for ORR [44]. Similar conclusions are also drawn in the research on using the sulfur doped Fe/N/S to improve the catalytic performance of mesoporous carbon for ORR. The OH− ion is the composition of electrolyte, which provides the environment of ORR. It is also the product of oxygen reduction reaction. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have successful synthesized the high purity cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS. The structures of the cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS have been confirmed by SEM, TEM, XPS and other methodologies. The high catalytic performances of cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS for ORR are investigated by CV, LSV, Tafel, RDE and other methods. Our study shows that the peak current intensity and long-time running stability of the cubic NiS2 surpasses that of Pt/C catalyst. The half-wave potential of ORR of the cubic NiS2 is only 40 mV lower than that of Pt/C catalyst. The high catalytic performance of NiS2 should be attributed to the SS bond of S2− ions, which promote the ORR happening through 4-electron pathway. Thinking about the structure and catalytic performance of chalcogenide based compound, we predict that the metal disulphide based materials have great potential to be high performance catalysts for ORR.

        "dc:description": "Developing high performance and low cost non-precious metal based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for a wide range of industrial applications of fuel cells. Here, we report the catalytic performance of a novel cubic NiS2 and hexagonal NiS catalysts for ORR. Both the NiS2 and NiS are synthesized by facile one-pot hydrothermal method and exhibit a high level of purity. Compared to conventional Pt/C catalysts, the NiS2 catalyst yields a higher peak current intensity and enhanced long time running stability despite the half wave potential is 40 mV lower than that of Pt/C catalyst. Rotating disc electrode tests show that the NiS2 catalyzes ORR mainly happening through 4-electron pathway. Thus, the NiS catalyzes ORR happening through 2-electron pathway. We envision that the NiS2 catalyst has great potential to be alternate for the Pt/C catalyst for ORR in alkaline fuel cells.",
