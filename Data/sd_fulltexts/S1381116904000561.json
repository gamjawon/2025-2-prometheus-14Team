The rhodium–carbene complexes RhCl(COD)(1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene), 2a–d, are an active catalyst for addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes. Keywords N-Heterocyclic carbene Rhodium complexes Imidazolidinylidine Arylation Aldehydes 1 Introduction In the last decade N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC’s) have been the subject of intense research in the field of organometallic chemistry [1,2]. Because of their extraordinary properties they have found access to a great variety of catalytic processes which include C–C-coupling reactions, [3] formation of furans, [4] cyclopropanation, [5] olefin metathesis, [6] hydroformylation, [7] polymerization [8] and hydrosilylation reactions [9]. Complexes containing imidazolin-2-ylidenes, which are neutral two-electron-donor ligands with negligible π-back-bonding, are thermally rather stable. This feature represents an essential prerequisite for the synthesis of highly efficient catalysts. The low reactivity of these ligands as compared to Fischer and Schrock type carbenes and to tertiary phosphines, which are susceptible to facile oxidation or P–C degradation makes them useful ancillary ligands to control the reactivity in a number of catalytic processes. Employment of sterically demanding N-heterocyclic carbenes, which resemble bulky phosphines with respect to their bonding, has led to the synthesis of new robust ruthenium, rhodium and palladium catalysts, which are less oxygen sensitive in comparison to the phosphine analogues [10]. Our contribution to this field has started with syntheses of imidazolidin-2-ylidenes complexes of Rh(I) and Ru(II) which are capable of catalyzing the cyclopropanation of styrene with ethyl diazoacetate and intramolecular cyclization of (Z)-3-methylpent-2-en-4-yn-1-ol into 2,3-dimethylfuran in good yields [4,5]. These complexes are insensitive to air and moisture and are thermally stable in both the solid state and in solution. We have now considered the possibility of generating heterocyclic carbenes that have pendent arene group to evaluate their ability to chelate the ruthenium atom, stabilise the complex or create catalytic activity [11]. Rhodium–carbene complexes have been extensively studied. However, there are few reports on the catalytic activity of rhodium–carbene complexes in rhodium-mediated processes [9,12]. Miyaura and co-workers [13] reported that rhodium catalyzes the addition of aryl and alkenylboronic acids to aldehydes giving secondary alcohols. The reactions were facilitated by the presence of an electron withdrawing group on the aldehyde and an electron donating group on the arylboronic acid, suggesting that the mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack of the aryl group on the aldehyde. The finding that these reactions were run with sterically hindered and strongly basic ligands attracted the attention of Fürstner who subsequently applied N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. A in situ generated catalytic system for the addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes is prepared combination of rhodium salt, 1,3-bis(alkyl or aryl)imidazolium chloride and base [14]. Based on these findings and our continuing interest in developing more efficient and stable catalysts, we wished to examine whether we could influence the catalytic activity of rhodium complexes for the addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes (Scheme 1 ). We now report (i) the straightforward preparation of new RhCl(COD)(1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene) complexes; (ii) their efficiency as catalysts for the addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes. 2 Experimental Manipulations were prepared with standard Schlenk techniques under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen with previously dried solvents. The complex [RhCl(COD)]2 [18] and 1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene were prepared according to known methods [15]. Infrared spectra were recorded as KBr pellets in the range 400–4000cm−1 on a ATI UNICAM 2000 spectrometer. 1H NMR (300MHz) and 13C NMR (75.5MHz) were recorded on a Bruker AM 300 WB FT spectrometer with chemical shifts referenced to residual solvent CDCl3. Microanalyses were performed by the TÜBİTAK analyses centre. 2.1 General procedure for the preparation of the rhodium–carbene complexes (2a–d) A solution of 1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene (1) (0.5mmol) and [RhCl(COD)]2 (0.5mmol) in toluene (15ml) was heated under reflux for 2h. Upon cooling to room temperature, yellow-orange crystals of 2a–d were obtained. The crystals were filtered, washed with diethyl ether (3×15ml) and dried under vacuum. 2.2 General procedure for rhodium–carbene catalyzed addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes Phenylboronic acid (1.20g, 9.8mmol), KOtBu (4.9mmol), substituted aldehydes (4.9mmol), rhodium carbene catalyst (1mol%), dimethoxyethane (15ml) were introduced in to Schlenk tube and then water (5ml) was added. The resulting mixture was heated for 0.4–2.0h at 80°C, cooled to ambient temperature, extracted with ethyl acetate (30ml). After drying over MgSO4 the organic phase was evaporated and the residue was purified by flash chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate, 6/1). 2.3 RhCl(COD)[CN{CH2C6H2Me3−2,4,6}CH2CH2N{CH2C6H2Me3−2,4,6}] (2a) 1H NMR (δ, CDCl3): 2.83 [s, 4H, NCH 2CH 2N]; 6.80 [s, 4H, CH2C6 H 2Me3-2,4,6]; 5.00 and 3.60 [s, 4H, CH 2C6H2Me3-2,4,6]; 2.33 and 2.19 [s, 18H, CH2C6H2 Me 3-2,4,6]; 5.50 and 5.03 [d, 3 J=13.90Hz, 4H, CH COD]; 2.37 and 1.9 [m, 8H, CH 2COD]; 13C {H}NMR (δ, CDCl3): 214.6 [d, J=46.58Hz, C carbene]; 47.7 [NCH2 CH2N]; 138.6, 138.0, 129.6 and 129.4 [CH2 C 6H2Me3-2,4,6]; 49.1 [CH2C6H2Me3-2,4,6]; 21.3 and 21.1 [CH2C6H2 Me 3-2,4,6]; 99.5 and 68.0 [d, J=6.64Hz and J=14.65Hz, CHCOD]; 33.3 and 29.1 [CH2COD].

[15]. The reaction of tetraaminoethene 1 with the binuclear [RhCl(COD)]2 complex proceeded smoothly in refluxing toluene to give the RhCl(COD)(1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene) complexes 2a–d as crystalline solids in 86–93% yields (Scheme 2 , Table 1 ). Complexes 2a–d, which are very stable in the solid state have been characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques (Table 1). Rhodium complexes exhibit a characteristic υ (NCN) band (Table 1) typically at 1590–1612cm−1 [5,16]. 13C chemical shifts, which provide a useful diagnostic tool for metal–carbene complexes, show that Ccarb is substantially deshielded. Values of δ(13Ccarb) are in the range 211–214ppm and are similar to those found in other carbene complexes. Coupling constants J(103Rh–13C) for the new rhodium complexes (2a–d) are comparable with those found for carbene rhodium(I) complexes (Table 1). These new complexes show typical spectroscopic signatures which are in line with those recently reported for other RhCl(COD)(1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene) complexes [5,16,17]. Although the addition of carbon nucleophiles to aldehydes is usually a facile process, limits are encountered that functionalized organometallic reagents required. Rhodium complexes 2a–d were found to be active catalysts for the addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes and proved to be thermally robust for high temperature. The addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes proceeds in high yields and quite rapidly even with a low catalyst loading. The results were summarized in Table 2 . Under those conditions, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and 4-chlorobenzaldehyde react very cleanly with phenylboronic acid in goods yields (Table 2, entries 4, 7, 12 and 16). 4 Conclusion From readily available starting materials, such as 1,3-dialkyl-imidazolinylidene four rhodium–carbene (2a–d) have been prepared and characterized. Also a convenient and highly user-friendly method for the addition of phenylboronic acid to aldehydes is presented. The procedure is simple and efficient towards various aryl aldehydes and does not require induction periods.
