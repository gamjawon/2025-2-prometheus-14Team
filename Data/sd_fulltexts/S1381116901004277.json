Tel.: +1-847-491-5045; fax: +1-847-467-1018 Simultaneous NO reduction and CO oxidation in the presence of O2, H2O and SO2 over Cu/Mg/Al/O (Cu-cat), Ce/Mg/Al/O (Ce-cat) and Cu/Ce/Mg/Al/O (CuCe-cat) were studied. At low temperatures (<340°C), the presence of O2 or H2O enhanced the activity of CuCe-cat for NO and CO conversions, but significantly suppressed the activity of Cu-cat and Ce-cat. At high temperature (720°C), the presence of O2 or H2O had no adverse effect on the NO and CO conversions over these catalysts. The addition of SO2 to NO+CO+O2+H2O system had no effect on the reaction of CO+O2 over Cu-cat, but deactivated this catalyst for NO+CO and CO+H2O reactions; over Ce-cat, all of these reactions of NO+CO,CO+O2 and CO+H2O were suppressed significantly; over CuCe-cat, NO+CO and CO+O2 reactions were not affected while the reaction of CO+H2O was slightly inhibited. Keywords NO reduction CO oxidation FCC H2O and SO2 poisoning NO and CO co-adsorption 1 Introduction The reduction of NO by CO is the most ideal way to remove simultaneously NO and CO from industrial effluents, and therefore, it has received particular attention [1–3]. Copper-based catalysts show a high activity in the conversion of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) to N2 [2–4]. However, the deactivation caused by copper oxide aggregation or SO2 poisoning is still an unsolved problem [5]. Cerium oxide has been widely used in the automotive three-way catalytic converter as an oxygen storage medium and thermal stabilizer. The addition of ceria to precious metal (Pd, Pt, Rh) can strongly improve the catalyst performance [6,7]. Several binary mixtures of transition metal and ceria have been proposed in literature [8–10]. In the regenerator of fluid catalytic cracking units (FCC, the principal gasoline-producing process in the refinery; for details see Ref. [11]), the high-temperature flue gas (650–760°C) contains NO, NO2, O2, CO, CO2, SO2, SO3, H2O simultaneously. Therefore, the FCC regenerator poses a very challenging problem for controlling NO x [12]. In the dense phase bed of the FCC regenerator, the CO concentration is much higher than the O2 concentration [11]. A CO combustion promoter is usually used in industrial operations to control the emission of CO. However, the use of this promoter increases the NO x emissions [13]. In this paper, we report a cerium-promoted Cu/Ce/Mg/Al/O mixed oxide catalyst which displays high activity for simultaneous removal of NO and CO in the presence of O2, H2O and SO2 under the conditions similar to those found in the dense phase bed of FCC. 2 Experimental Cu/Ce/Mg/Al/O was prepared by co-precipitation of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (total cation concentration of 1M) with an aqueous solution of NaOH and Na2CO3 (CO3 2−-to-Al molar ratio of 0.5). The detailed procedure is described elsewhere [14–17]. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried at 120°C for 12h, and then calcined in air at 750°C for 3h. The resulting product was designated as CuCe-cat. Cu-cat or Ce-cat catalyst was prepared using the same procedure except Ce(NO3)3·6H2O or Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, respectively, which was not included. The catalytic reaction tests were carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor with a porous frit in flow conditions. The quartz reactor was loaded with 150mg (particulate size: 0.45–0.90mm) of catalyst. The composition of the feed gas was regulated by mass flow controllers (Brooks 5058). A typical feed contained 600ppm NO, 1.4vol.% CO and 0.5% O2 (similar to the conditions in the dense phase bed of the FCC regenerator) with ultra-high purity He as diluent. When desired, 1% H2O was added to the feed using a H2O saturator. The effect of SO2 was examined by introducing 500ppm SO2 into the reaction system. The total flow rate was 400ml/min. The experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure. A cold trap connected at the outlet of the reactor was used to remove the water from the effluent gas. The composition of the feed or effluent gas was analyzed on-line with QGS-08B infrared analyzers (for NO) and a GC-8APT gas chromatograph with two columns (GDX303 for SO2 and CO2; 13X for CO, O2, N2) and a TCD detector. NO and CO conversions were calculated from the formation of N2 and CO2, respectively. The products were also monitored on-line by mass spectrometry (Balzers Oministar, Quadrupole) in some runs. 3 Results and discussion The catalysts used in this work are listed in Table 1 . Fig. 1 shows the NO conversions as a function of temperature over Cu-cat and CuCe-cat in the absence and presence of O2. It can be seen that for the NO+CO system, in the low temperature region (lower than 340°C), CuCe-cat has a higher NO reduction activity (reaching 100% conversion at 315°C) than Cu-cat, and the difference increases with temperature within that region. At high temperatures, NO conversions over both catalysts reach 100%. The addition of O2 to the feed produces a completely different effect on the NO conversion over Cu-cat and CuCe-cat. The presence of O2 enhances the activity of CuCe-cat while it decreases the activity of Cu-cat. The activity of Ce-cat for NO conversion (not shown in Fig. 1) is much lower than that of CuCe-cat or Cu-cat under the same conditions. The presence of O2 reduces the activity of Ce-cat. In order to clarify the effect of O2 on the reaction of NO+CO over these catalysts, the co-adsorption of NO and CO and the influence of O2 on the adsorption of NO and CO were investigated by IR spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the IR spectra of NO and CO co-adsorption on CuCe-cat at room temperature. There is an intense band at 2118cm−1 with several weak bands at 1888, 1875, and 2355cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2A). The band at 2118cm−1 is ascribed to CO ligated to Cu+ sites [18] and the band at 1888cm−1 corresponds to the adsorption of NO on Cu2+ [19]. The 1875cm−1 band is attributed to gaseous NO and the 2355cm−1 band is tentatively attributed to the adsorption of N2O [20]. After subsequent evacuation up to 10−2 Pa at room temperature, the 2118cm−1 band decreases and shifts to a lower frequency of 2102cm−1 while the bands at 1888 and 1875cm−1 disappear completely. The shift of the 2118cm−1 band upon evacuation is attributed to the decrease of surface coverage of CO. Fig. 2B shows the effect of O2 on the NO and CO adsorption. After introducing O2 into the system, the band corresponding to the CO adsorption on Cu+ decreases significantly in intensity (by a factor of 4). However, it is interesting to note that the band assigned to NO adsorption on Cu2+ increases by a factor larger than 5. This indicates that the addition of a small amount of O2 enhances the adsorption of NO. After evacuation, both bands shift to a slightly lower frequency while they decrease in intensity. As reported in our previous paper [14], a large number of Cu+ ions—active for CO adsorption—are formed during the calcination of CuCe-cat as a result of the strong synergistic effect between copper and cerium ions. The presence of O2 oxidizes some Cu+ ions into Cu2+ ions, which are not active for CO adsorption but are active for NO adsorption [19]. This explains the corresponding decreased intensity of the band at 2118cm−1 and the increased intensity of the band at 1888cm−1. Over Cu-cat, most of the copper ions are present as Cu2+ ions [14]. Over Ce-cat, no NO and CO adsorption are detected by IR spectroscopy (not shown here). The exact ν CO band position is considered to be dependent on the environment of the Cu+ ion to which CO is bound. The shift from 2118 to 2139cm−1 with the addition of O2 is due to a greater concentration of Cu2+ ions in positions surrounding the Cu+ adsorption site [21]. The influences of the addition of water vapor and SO2 on the NO conversions over these three catalysts were examined and the results are presented in Table 2 . When 1% H2O is introduced into the feed, Cu-cat loses its activity completely at 250°C; the activity at 300°C also drops drastically. However, at the same conditions (250 or 300°C), it is interesting to note that the addition of H2O enhances the activity of CuCe-cat significantly. At high temperatures, the presence of H2O has no significant effect on the NO conversion. At 720°C, the addition of SO2 results in a drastic decline of NO conversion, from 100 to 31.4% for Cu-cat and from 100 to 16.2% for Ce-cat during the first 40min. These data indicate that both catalysts are rapidly poisoned by SO2. However, the presence of SO2 in the feed has no adverse effect on the NO conversion over CuCe-cat which maintains 100% conversion. Even after a 24h run, no decline in conversion is observed. Table 3 gives CO conversions under different reaction conditions. At 250°C, CuCe-cat and Cu-cat have much higher CO oxidation activity than Ce-cat. The presence of H2O increases CO conversion over CuCe-cat while drastically reducing it over Cu-cat or Ce-cat. At 720°C, the addition of H2O promotes CO conversion over all the three catalysts. The presence of SO2 in the NO+CO+O2+H2O system has no effect on the reaction between CO and O2 over Cu-cat, but deactivates this catalyst completely for the reaction of CO+H2O (this is also confirmed by MS data; not shown here). For Ce-cat, both the reactions of CO+O2 and CO+H2O are suppressed significantly. However, the CO conversion over CuCe-cat increases slightly with the addition of SO2. The effects of O2, H2O and SO2 on the CO and NO conversions over CuCe-cat can be seen in detail in Fig. 3 . When 0.5% O2 is introduced into the system, it is consumed completely by CO, concomitant with the formation of CO2. With the addition of water vapor, the signal of CO decreases and that of CO2 increases. Meanwhile, H2 is detected. The addition of SO2 has no effect on the reaction of CO+O2, but slightly inhibits the reaction of CO+H2O. The increase of the CO2 signal is derived from the reaction of CO+SO2→CO2+S, as evidenced by the condensate of sulfur in the reactor outlet. No undesirable COS and H2S are detected in the whole experiment. 4 Remarks From the preceding results, it can been seen that CuCe-cat shows higher catalytic activity and stability than Cu-cat and Ce-cat for the simultaneous removal of NO and CO in the presence of O2, H2O and SO2. The addition of O2 increases NO conversion over CuCe-cat because it oxidizes some Cu+ ions to Cu2+ ions which are active for NO adsorption. The different influence of H2O on NO and CO conversion derives from the different activities of the catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, CO+H2O→CO2+H2). With many more Cu+ sites for CO adsorption, CuCe-cat exhibits a high WGSR activity at low temperature while Cu-cat and Ce-cat require high temperature [22]. At low temperature, the strong adsorption of H2O on Cu2+ or Cu+ sites will inhibit the adsorption of NO or CO over Cu-cat; however, for CuCe-cat, WGSR leads to the increase of CO conversion and the formation of H2 which is active for NO reduction at low temperature. The presence of SO2 increases the CO conversion and has no adverse effect on NO conversion over CuCe-cat at 720°C; however, it significantly decreases both NO and CO conversions over Cu-cat and Ce-cat. All of these promoted performances of CuCe-cat result from the strong interaction of copper and cerium which gives rise to a large number of Cu+ ions [14]. SO2 cannot block CO adsorption on Cu+ ions [23]. Further work is underway to elucidate the reaction mechanism in detail.

        "dc:description": "Simultaneous NO reduction and CO oxidation in the presence of O2, H2O and SO2 over Cu/Mg/Al/O (Cu-cat), Ce/Mg/Al/O (Ce-cat) and Cu/Ce/Mg/Al/O (CuCe-cat) were studied. At low temperatures (<340°C), the presence of O2 or H2O enhanced the activity of CuCe-cat for NO and CO conversions, but significantly suppressed the activity of Cu-cat and Ce-cat. At high temperature (720°C), the presence of O2 or H2O had no adverse effect on the NO and CO conversions over these catalysts. The addition of SO2 to NO+CO+O2+H2O system had no effect on the reaction of CO+O2 over Cu-cat, but deactivated this catalyst for NO+CO and CO+H2O reactions; over Ce-cat, all of these reactions of NO+CO,CO+O2 and CO+H2O were suppressed significantly; over CuCe-cat, NO+CO and CO+O2 reactions were not affected while the reaction of CO+H2O was slightly inhibited.",
