R. Mulla, Sunil P. Gupte and Raghunath V. Chaudhari** Chemical Engineering Division, Natl Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411 008 (India) (Received December 7, 1990; accepted April 15, 1991) The oxidative carbonylation of amines has attracted considerable interest due to its importance in the synthesis of carbamates. Based on this nonphosgene route, a new process for the manufacture of methylene diphenyl dilsocyanate (MDI) has been developed [ 1 ]. Fukuoka et al. reported oxidative carbonylation of amines to carbamates using supported Pd and Rh catalysts [2]. Recently, a detailed investigation on effect of reaction conditions on the activity and selectivity of diphenyl urea using a Pd/C-Nal catalyst system has been reported [3]. Oxidative carbonylation of alkyl amines is also known to give corresponding diallyl urea and allyl carbamates as products [4]. In most of the earlier reports, supported Pd catalysts have been used and there are only a few reports on homogeneously catalysed carbonylation of amines, e.g. Giannoccaro et al., Alper and Hartstock have reported oxidative carbonylation of aniline to N, N-diphenyl urea using Pd complex catalysts [ 4-6 ]. In this communication, preliminary data on the homogeneously catalysed oxidative alkoxycarbonylation of aniline to N, N-diphenyl urea (I) and Nphenyl carbamate (II) has been reported. The reaction is described as: caW5,sc 2ArNH2+CO+f02 --> ArNHCONHAr+HzO (1) (I) (I)+CH3oH---- ArNHCOOCH3+ArNHz (2) (n) The aim of this work was to evaluate performance of a variety of Pd, Ru and Rh complex catalysts for the above reaction. Experftnental The transition metal salts such as PdCI2, RhCl3 - 3H20 and RuCi3 - 3H20 were procured from Arora-Matthey Ltd. and were used as such. Aniline A.R. *NCL communication number 5056. \"Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991 - Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne LS grade was freshly distilled before use. Methanol was dried and doubly distilled before use. Carbon monoxide gas was used from cylinders, the purity of which was found to be greater than 99.5% by GC analysis. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 283 B spectrophotometer. Preparations Rh(CO)2acac was prepared according to the procedure described earlier [7]. Ru complexes were prepared by methods described in the literature [8, 9]. Pd(aniline)ZXZ complexes were prepared by refluxing 1.0 g of PdXz salts in 90 cm' benzene containing 10 cm3 of aniline for 2 h. The yellow coloured complex was filtered and washed with n-hexane; yield 60-80ss'o. Catalytic reactions In a typical procedure, a mixture of aniline (108 mmol), Pd(aniline)212 (0.2 mmol) and solvent methanol (90 cm') were charged into a 300 cm' capacity Hastelloy C autoclave. The autoclave was pressurized with carbon monoxide and oxygen up to a total pressure of 41 atm. (C0:02= 13:1). The reaction was carried out at 170 C for 2 h under stirring. During the course of the reaction the autoclave pressure was maintained at 41 atm by feeding CO:O2 mixture in a 2:1 ratio from the reservior. After cooling the contents, a portion of the wine-red-coloured solution obtained was analyzed on GLC and HPLC for aniline, carbamate and urea. The analysis of the sample showed 65% conversion of aniline, with 100% yield of N-phenyl methyl carbamate. Results and discussion It has been shown in this study that oxidative alkoxycarbonylation of aniline catalysed by homogeneous transition metal complexes gives carbamate and urea as the main products. Table 1 shows the activity of several transition metal complexes employed in this work, along with the selectivity obtained for carbamate and urea. Comparison of results in this table indicate that for Pd, Rh and Ru complexes, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst varies with the ligand environment around the central metal atom. For example, for Pd(aniline)2X2, (where X = Cl, Br or I) the activity of the catalyst and its selectivity for carbamate increased from CI to I. The conversion and selectivity for carbamate also increase with increasing catalyst concentration (runs 9, 11 and 14). In absence of alcohol only urea is formed in high yields (runs 17 and 18). Comparison of the activity of metal iodide catalysts shows that the Pd is the most active and selective catalyst for carbamate synthesis, followed by Rh and Ru respectively (runs 1, 8 and 10). It can be seen from this table that iodine-containing complexes show markedly higher activity and selectivity for carbamate than other complexes. It is interesting to note that most of the active catalysts contain halide as a ligand, however the catalyst Rh(CO)2acac shows activity for oxidative alkoxycarbonylation reaction even in the absence of any halide-containing ligand. The activity of the catalyst containing CI ligands increases remarkably when iodine-containing promoters such as NaI are added to the system.

It is known that Rh and Ru precursors employed in this work form anionic species of the type [Rh(CO)ZIZ]- and [Ru(CO)3I3]- in the presence of CO and Nal [8]. Examination of IR spectra of reaction solutions (runs 12 to 13) clearly indicated two carbonyl frequencies in the v(CO) range of 2010(sh), 1985(s) cm-1 and 1955(sh), 1930(s) cm-1. It is indicated from runs 12-13 that if iodide is present in the catalyst precursor, the active catalytic intermediate is formed even in the absence of a promoter such as NaI. The higher activity observed in runs 12 and 13, wherein [Ru(CO)3I3]- is used as a catalyst precursor, indicates that anionic intermediates are the most likely reactive species. The IR spectrum of reaction solution containing the catalytic intermediate of Pd complexes did not show any carbonyl frequency, as Pd carbonyl complexes are highly unstable and were found to decompose to metallic Pd during recording of the spectrum. L10 Conclusion In conclusion, these results indicate that metal carbonyl complexes of the type [M(CO)mX , )- (where X=halogen and m=2 or 3) are the key catalytic intermediates in the homogeneously catalysed oxidative carbonylation of amines. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst are highest with iodinecontaining ligands and depend on the ease with which the catalyst precusor can be converted into active catalytic intermediate, viz. M(CO)mIm (see runs 5, 7 and 16). References 1 S. Fukuoka, M. Chono and M. Kohno, CHEMTECH, Nov. (1984) 670. 2 S. Fukuoka, M., Chono and M. Kohno, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., (1984) 399; S.
