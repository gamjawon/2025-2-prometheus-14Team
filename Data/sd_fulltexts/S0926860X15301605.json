Fax : +81 53 478 1159. Graphical abstract Several copper alumina catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method were examined for the production of hydrogen from dimethyl ether (DME). Each of the catalysts was used individually for DME steam reforming, without mixing of DME hydrolysis catalysts such as alumina and zeolite. In order to obtain hydrogen by DME steam reforming, mixed catalysts with DME hydrolysis catalysts and methanol steam reforming catalysts are usually used based on the reaction mechanism. However, the rate of hydrogen production in the single use of copper alumina catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method is faster than those of mixed catalysts. SEM-EDS analysis confirmed that alumina and copper coexist and are well dispersed on the surfaces of sol–gel copper alumina catalysts. Therefore, two reactions of DME hydrolysis over alumina sites and methanol steam reforming over copper sites occur more sequentially in the case of sol–gel catalysts than in the case of mixed catalysts. Several experiments also suggest that Cu–Zn(29–1wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method is the best catalyst for more hydrogen production and less CO production from DME. DME steam reforming over the catalyst at 275°C showed the following data; DME conversion: 95%, yield of H2: 95%, and CO concentration: 0.8mol.%. We have developed some outstanding new catalysts that produce hydrogen from DME at the low reforming temperature. Keywords Dimethyl ether (DME) Steam reforming Hydrogen Sol–gel Copper 1 Introduction The fuel cell is expected as a method of restraining global warming because of its excellent energy efficiency. Steam reforming of fossil fuels is being actively researched and developed as a hydrogen supply method for fuel cells. Dimethyl ether (DME) is expected as a clean fuel for the 21st century [1], because DME burns with the emission of no particulate matter (PM), no sulfur oxides (SOx), and less nitrogen oxides (NOx). The cetane number of DME is 55–60, and DME is attractive as a clean fuel for diesel engines. Its physical properties are similar to those of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). DME is easily liquefied at −25°C and atmospheric pressure, and at 0.5MPa and ambient temperature. DME is easily handled like LPG and used for domestic fuels. DME is produced from coal, natural gas, biomass, and so forth. DME is a multi-source and multi-use fuel and energy. Global annual DME production capacity is approximately 10 million metric tons and actual market use is about 3 million metric tons [2]. Recently, DME has also become a potential fuel for hydrogen production to be used in fuel cells. DME is an excellent hydrogen source, storage, and carrier [3]. 13wt.% of DME molecule (CH3OCH3; MW 46.07) is H2, and if one DME molecule will be treated with H2O six H2 molecules will be produced. We have been studying the steam reforming of DME for hydrogen production. New types of catalysts have been developed using the sol–gel [4,5]. Hydrogen production by steam reforming of DME (SRDME) consists of two steps: the first is DME hydrolysis, and the second is the steam reforming of methanol (SRM). The chemical equation of SRDME (Eq. (1)) is separated for that of DME hydrolysis (Eq. (2)) and that of SRM (Eq. (3)), as follows: (1) C H 3 O C H 3 + 3 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 2 C O 2 ( steam reforming of DME ) , (2) C H 3 O C H 3 + H 2 O → 2 C H 3 O H ( hydrolysis of DME ) , (3) 2 C H 3 O H + 2 H 2 O → 6 H 2 + 2 C O 2 ( steam reforming of methanol ) Most researchers [6–21] have reported mixed catalysts with DME hydrolysis catalysts and SRM catalysts, because of the above-mentioned equations. However, we focused on a single use type catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method in terms of catalyst activity, catalyst life, and for ease of industrial processing that eliminates the mechanical mixing procedure. We have already reported that the copper alumina catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method in single use produce more hydrogen than physically mixed catalysts by commercial catalysts of DME hydrolysis and SRM [4]. As Volkova et al. mentioned [22], these catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method are the first bifunctional catalysts reported out. After that Volkova et al. and Snytnikov et al. developed the bifunctional Cu–Ce/Al2O3 catalysts [22,23]. In our previous paper, we speculated that the Lewis acid sites on γ-Al2O3 for DME hydrolysis and active sites for SRM such as copper are coexistent and well dispersed on the surfaces of the catalysts. It is the reason that the Cu/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method are effective for hydrogen production by DME steam reforming. In this paper, we analyzed the surface of Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method in order to confirm our speculation by SEM-EDS. We also investigated for the improvement of further activities. In a previous paper [4], catalysts with 10wt.% metal loading were examined from the viewpoint of the sol–gel method. However, the activities of SRM increases with the increase of Cu loading percent in Cu/SiO2 and Cu/Al2O3 prepared using the sol–gel method, and the optimum percent was 30–50wt.%Cu for SRM [24–28]. In this paper, for optimization of Cu–Zn–Al2O3 ratio, the influences of Cu loading, and amount of Zn addition were also investigated for improvement of the hydrogen yield and the hydrogen production rate from DME. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation All catalysts used for this research were prepared using the sol–gel method. For example, Cu–Zn/Al2O3 was obtained by the hydrolysis of the mixed solution with aluminum isopropoxide (AIP), Cu(NO3) 2, Zn(NO3)2, water, and small amount of ethylene glycol (EG). The amount of Cu(NO3)2 and/or Zn(NO3) 2 depended on the loading metal percent of the catalysts needed. AIP (purity of Al[OCH(CH3)2]3: 95%), EG (purity of HOCH2CH2OH: 99.5%,), copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (purity of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O: 99%), zinc(II) nitrate hexahydrate (purity of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O: 99%) used here were manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Wako). AIP (∼10g) was crushed using a mortar, and then dissolved and suspended in hot water (∼70°C, ∼200ml), and a mixed aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2 was added to the mixed hot water. A small amount of EG (e.g., ∼5% of the total solution amount) was also added as a sort of surfactant into the mixed hot water. This mixture was stirred and heated at ∼70°C for ∼30min. Then, diluted nitric acid aqueous solution, made from HNO3 (69.5%, Wako), was added every 15min several times, and the pH of the mixture was lowered with several additions until the pH decreased to 1–2. Usually, all the steps of this process took ∼5h. Regarding HNO3 addition, a clear-sol of boehmite was formed. Water in this sol was evaporated under reduced pressure by using a rotary evaporator, and a gel was obtained. The obtained gel was dried at 170°C over night. The dried gel was ground by using an agate mortar until the diameter of each grain of powder was less than 150μm. The powder was calcined at 500°C for 5h, and ∼3-g alumina catalysts were usually obtained depending on the metal loading amount. Before steam reforming of DME, the catalysts were reduced by flowing H2 (99.99%, 10mlmin−1) at 450°C for 10h, and were evacuated at 300°C for 1h, respectively. This treatment may sinter the metals of catalysts and the catalysts themselves, and lead to a deterioration of activity. However, we consider that the sintering before reaction is a smaller problem for a comparison of catalyst activity than sintering while the reaction takes place. Instead of the duration test of the catalysts, the catalysts after this intense pretreatment were compared on the activity, selectivity and so forth. The alumina in the catalyst was found to be mainly γ-alumina by measured X-ray diffraction analysis. The condition of copper is metallic form and zinc is ZnO form, but for ease of calculation for preparation the catalyst is called such as Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst. Comparison catalysts of SRDME, Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2, were prepared by almost same way of the above-mentioned sol–gel method. Difference is the selection and change of AIP to tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS; purity of (C2H5O)4Si: 95%; Wako). This Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method is one of the excellent catalysts for H2 production by SRM. For example, H2 yield by SRM over the Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2 catalyst at 350°C and at 400°C under the atmospheric pressure are 99.3% and 97.9%, respectively [24–26]. As mentioned above, SRDME (Eq. (1)) consists of DME hydrolysis (Eq. (2)) and SRM (Eq. (3)), so excellent SRM catalysts have excellent performance for H2 production by SRDME. γ-Al2O3 was prepared by AIP hydrolysis without Cu and Zn nitrates as mentioned above. γ- Al2O3 is one of acid catalysts, and it is good catalyst for DME hydrolysis [4]. These catalysts were also ground by using an agate mortar until the diameter of each grain of powder was less than 150μm, respectively. Each portion of the powder was also calcined at 500°C for 5h. These two catalysts were used for SRDME in two mixing ways, details are mentioned in the results session. 2.2 Surface analysis of Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) analysis was performed for the surface characterization of Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method. The system used was JEOL JSM-6060LA, and the acceleration voltage was 5kV. For easy detection of Cu and Zn, much metal loading catalyst, Cu–Zn(25–15wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method was used for this analysis. After the aforesaid preparation method and the calcination, this catalyst was reduced and evacuated under the same conditions as mentioned above. The reduced catalyst was kept at He gas atmosphere in a closed Pyrex glass tube. Before SEM-EDS analysis, the glass tube was broken, and the catalyst was kept in the tube over night. This procedure is a sort of mild oxidation. If this reduced catalyst were placed on a sheet of paper from the broken tube, the oxidation heat would burn the paper, and the heat of the paper burning would burn the catalyst. The catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method are very air-sensitive after reduction. 2.3 Apparatus and steam reforming of DME DME steam reforming was performed in a flow reactor (7.6mm i.d. Pyrex glass tube) using 0.10g of the catalyst (d.m. <150μm) at a temperature range from 200 to 500°C at atmospheric pressure. Reactant (DME and water) flow with the Ar carrier gas was adjusted using two mass flow controllers (Brooks 580E). DME was diluted with Ar gas in a DME-Ar (5–95vol.%) gas cylinder, and the diluted DME gas flow was 1.9mlmin−1. Water was supplied from a bubbler with water at 0°C (vapor pressure: 4.581mmHg) by 50-mlmin−1 Ar gas flow. The reaction gas, a mixture of DME (flow of 2mmolg−cat −1 h−1) and water (flow of 6mmolg−cat −1 h−1), was supplied to the catalyst layer. The DME concentration and the water concentration of the inlet gas were 0.19% and 0.53%, respectively. The space velocity of all gases including Ar gas was 35×103 h−1, and that of the reactant gas (DME and water) was 0.27×103 h−1. The contact time was 0.10s. The reactor was part of a closed circulation system. After the above-mentioned reduction and evacuation in the rector, and before the reaction, the Brunaure–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the catalyst in the reactor (in situ) without exposure to air was measured using N2 gas at −196°C. Cu amount of catalyst surface and Cu surface area of catalysts were measured by N2O titration method using BELCAT-B manufactured by BEL Japan, Inc. For the analysis of the reactants and products, two gas chromatographs (GCs) manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation were used. One was a Shimadzu GC-6AM equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a methanizer (for CO analysis), and a flame ionization detector (FID). The GC had an MS-5A stainless column (80–100mesh, 5m long, i.d. 3mm) and its carrier gas was nitrogen. H2, Ar (as the internal standard for GC analysis), CH4, and CO were quantitatively analyzed. The other was a Shimadzu GC-4C with TCD and FID, and equipped with a Porapak Q stainless column (80–100mesh, 1m long, i.d. 3mm) and a Porapak R stainless column (80–100mesh, 0.5m long, i.d. 3mm) in series. Its carrier gas was helium. CH4, CO2, H2O, DME, and methanol were quantitatively analyzed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Steam reforming of DME over the two-layer catalyst, the mixed catalyst, and the single-use catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method In accordance with the SRDME reaction mechanism (Eqs. (1)–(3)), γ-A2O3 (a DME hydrolysis catalyst), Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2 (an SRM catalyst), and Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5wt.%)/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the sol–gel method were used for the three different catalyst types. One was the two-layer type catalyst consisting of the γ- Al2O3 catalyst (0.05g) layer (the 1st layer) and the Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2 catalyst (0.05g) layer (the 2nd layer). Another was the physically mixed catalysts consisting of the γ-Al2O3 catalyst (0.05g) and the Cu–Zn(9–1wt.%)/SiO2 catalyst (0.05g). The other was the single-use type catalyst, the Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst (0.1g) alone, without mixing of acid catalysts. These catalysts were used for SRDME. The physical data of the catalysts and the part of the results are in Table 1 . All catalysts produced H2, CO2, small amount of CO, and much smaller amount of CH4 and methanol. Example of the production details is shown Fig. 1 . The order of the H2 production rate and H2 yield over the catalysts were as follows: single-use type catalyst of an SRDME catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method (Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5wt.%)/Al2O3) > physically mixed catalyst consisting of a DME hydrolysis catalyst and an SRM catalyst (γ- Al2O3 and Cu–Zn/SiO2 physically mixed) >> two-layer type catalyst consisting of a DME hydrolysis catalyst and an SRM catalyst (γ-Al2O3 and Cu–Zn/SiO2 used separately) as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The order by the DME conversion is also the same order. From the production rate of H2 and the Cu amount of catalyst surface, turn over frequency (TOF) is estimated, and the data of the three catalysts are shown in Table 1. In the cases of TOF, H2 production rate per Cu surface area, and H2 production rate per catalyst surface area, the each order is also as follows: single-use type catalyst of an SRDME catalyst (Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5wt.%)/Al2O3 (Sol)) >> physically mixed catalyst consisting of a DME hydrolysis catalyst (γ-Al2O3) and an SRM catalyst (Cu–Zn/SiO2) >> two layer catalyst consisting of a DME hydrolysis catalyst (γ-Al2O3) and an SRM catalyst (Cu–Zn/SiO2). The Cu–Zn(4.5–0.5wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst was used singly and H2 was produced well, and from the catalyst contents; each particle of the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst has both of alumina sites for DME hydrolysis and copper sites for SRM. These results and the order suggest that two sites for DME hydrolysis and SRM should be the closer for the higher TOF, the faster H2 production rate, and the better H2 yield by SRDME. The sol–gel method is very optimum catalyst preparation method for these effects. 3.2 Surface analysis of Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the sol–gel method singly use produce hydrogen more effectively than physically mixed catalysts with DME hydrolysis catalysts and SRM catalysts. This is probably the reason that Al2O3 for DME hydrolysis to methanol and Cu for SRM to H2 and CO2 coexist closely and are well dispersed on the catalyst surface. In the case of mixed catalysts, each particle of the catalysts has each reaction sites of DME hydrolysis and SMR, respectively. This means that there is a greater distance between the DME hydrolysis sites (Al2O3 sites) and the SRM sites (Cu sites) than that between the two sites on the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method. In order to confirm this speculation, SEM-EDS analysis was performed on the surface of the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts. Some of the SEM photos are shown in Fig. 3 . The catalyst was ground by using an agate mortar until the diameter of each grain of powder was less than 150μm. From the SEM photos the catalyst is ground with cleavage into several sizes such as 0.5-120μm. On the large size catalysts, there are very small size catalysts. Each catalyst shows knobs and hills. Some photos of the SEM-ESD analysis are shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in the photo of the Cu analysis (b), red, yellow, and green mean detection of Cu, so such knobs and hills are Cu. As shown in the photo of the Al analysis (c), red, yellow, and green mean detection of Al, so Al (Al2O3) exists on the whole of the catalyst surface. The each color, red, yellow, green, and blue part in the Cu analysis (b) pattern between in the Al analysis (c) are almost opposite, so it is speculated that Cu is dotted within Al2O3. The all clusters of Cu are putting in/on Al2O3; it means that Cu atoms which are the active sites for methanol steam reforming and Al2O3 molecules that are the active sites for DME hydrolysis are contacting and dispersed well. Zn was not detected by the EDS, although a much metal loading catalyst, Cu–Zn (25–15wt.%)/Al2O3 prepared using the sol–gel method, was used for the easy detection of Cu and Zn. Zn may be dispersed well in and/or on the catalyst, while Cu makes sort of clusters and/or small aggregates. If Al2O3 is compared to seawater, Cu is observable as Cu is exposed from sea level (Al2O3 surface) like an iceberg and is dotted on the surface of the sea. Al2O3 and Cu coexist and are distributed with sufficient balance as predicted. It is considered that DME hydrolysis into methanol occurs on Al2O3 and the SRM to H2 and CO2 immediately takes place on Cu very near Al2O3. In the case of mixed catalysts, there are some distance between the DME hydrolysis catalysts and the SRM catalysts, so it is difficult to conduct these two reactions immediately. Fig. 5 shows the above-mentioned concepts. It is concluded that the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by the sol–gel method in single use has these two reactions occurring sequentially and efficiently, and a quick hydrogen production rate is obtained by the sol–gel Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst. The sol–gel method is very optimum catalyst preparation method for this reaction system of DMESR, and introduces the faster H2 production rate and higher H2 yield of SRDME. 3.3 Effect of Cu loading amount for SRDME Sol-gel preparation methods are usually used for a low loading metal amount such as less than 10wt.%. However, the activity of SRM is related to the surface area of Cu, and previous results show that the rate of H2 production increases with an increase in the Cu loading percent on the copper catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method [24–26]. Based on the SRM results, the dependence of the Cu loading percent for SRDME was examined. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . It is clear that 30wt.% is the most suitable loading percent of Cu for H2 production by SRDME. It is speculated that 70wt.%Al2O3-composition has the most comfortable surface percent of Al2O3 for DME hydrolysis, and the 30wt.%Cu-loading amount is the most suitable surface percent of Cu for SRM, because the rate of H2 production is the fastest among the different loaded Cu alumina catalysts. CO that is harmful to fuel cells was also produced with the highest percent over the Cu(30wt. %)/Al2O3 catalyst. It is considered that CO is formed by the reverse water-gas-shift reaction of H2 and CO2 produced from SRDME. 3.4 Effect of Zn addition amount for SRDME The effect of Zn addition into Cu/Al2O3(70wt.%) catalysts was examined. Zn addition into Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/SiO2 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method catalysts promotes hydrogen production by SRM [4,24–28]. This time Zn was added into Cu/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method for hydrogen production by SRDME. From the result of Fig. 6, the percent of alumina in the catalyst was settled at 70wt.%, and the total amount of Cu and Zn metals was settled at 30wt.%. Fig. 7 shows the relation between loading Zn percent and the H2 yield, or the CO concentration in the total amount of products. The H2 yield could be made higher by adding Zn, the most effective amount was 1wt.%. Zn is a promoter of SRM (Eq. (3)). ZnO may improve the dispersion and the reducibility of Cu2+ species [27–29]. SRDME (Eq. (1)) consists of DME hydrolysis (Eq. (2)) and SRM. DME hydrolysis is the rate-determining step. Produced methanol by the DME hydrolysis will be used for methanol to hydrogen by SRM, DME hydrolysis equilibrium (CH3OCH3 +H2O→2CH3OH (Eq. (2)) will be broken to right side by SRM. Therefore, SRM-promoter, Zn, will enhance the SRDME and H2 production with near to 100% of DME conversion and H2 yield. The addition of Zn works for enhancement of H2 production, but it didn't significantly work to restrain CO that is harmful to fuel cells. The other product was methane, but this amount was very low. Details of the products are in Fig. 8 . The Cu–Zn(29–1wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst produced H2 at a rate of 11.5 mmolg−cat −1 h−1 at 275°C, a very lower temperature than the temperature of methane and LPG reforming. A value of 11.5mmolg−cat −1 h−1 introduces a value of H2 yield (95%), because the theoretical maximum amount of H2 production from the reactant flow (DME-water =2–6mmolg−cat h−1) is 12 mmolg−cat −1 h−1. The DME conversion was 95%, and the concentration of CO was restrained at 0.8mol.%. Compared between Fig. 8 and Fig. 1, it is clear that SRDME catalysts are improved very well by these optimizations of Cu and Zn composition. We have already reported about the DME steam reforming and the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method in the previous paper [4]. This time, Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method and the ratio of Cu/Zn have optimized for the higher production of H2 by SEDME. The H2 yield increased from 94% at 350°C and 53% at 250°C to 95% at 275°C and 68% at 250°C. We have developed the catalyst for hydrogen production by SRDME at the lower reforming temperature using the sol–gel method. 4 Conclusions It is found that the sol–gel method is very optimum catalyst preparation method for DME steam reforming, because the sol–gel preparation method makes two sites for DME hydrolysis and SRM very close on the catalyst surface, and also because the method disperse the pairs of the two sites well. The optimization of the content ratio of Cu and Zn improves the catalyst activity compared with the previous results. Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method singly use produce hydrogen more effectively at a lower reaction temperature than physically mixed catalysts with DME hydrolysis catalysts and SRM catalysts. SEM-EDS analysis suggests that this is the reason that Al2O3 for DME hydrolysis to methanol and Cu for SRM to H2 and CO2 coexist closely and are well dispersed on the catalyst surface. In the case of mixed catalysts, there is a longer distance between the DME hydrolysis catalysts and SRM catalysts than that of the two sites on the Cu–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method. Therefore, two reactions of DME hydrolysis over alumina sites and SRM over Cu sites occur more sequentially in the case of sol–gel alumina catalysts than in the case of mixed catalysts of DME hydrolysis catalysts and SRM catalysts. The addition of Zn into Cu/Al2O3(70wt.%) enhances the SRDME activities. The Cu–Zn(29–1wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst show excellent activity of SRDME at the lower reforming temperature of 275°C; the DME conversion was 95%; the H2 yield was 95%; and the CO concentration was 0.8mol.%.

        "dc:description": "Several copper alumina catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method were examined for the production of hydrogen from dimethyl ether (DME). Each of the catalysts was used individually for DME steam reforming, without mixing of DME hydrolysis catalysts such as alumina and zeolite. In order to obtain hydrogen by DME steam reforming, mixed catalysts with DME hydrolysis catalysts and methanol steam reforming catalysts are usually used based on the reaction mechanism. However, the rate of hydrogen production in the single use of copper alumina catalysts prepared using the sol–gel method is faster than those of mixed catalysts. SEM-EDS analysis confirmed that alumina and copper coexist and are well dispersed on the surfaces of sol–gel copper alumina catalysts. Therefore, two reactions of DME hydrolysis over alumina sites and methanol steam reforming over copper sites occur more sequentially in the case of sol–gel catalysts than in the case of mixed catalysts. Several experiments also suggest that Cu–Zn(29–1wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using the sol–gel method is the best catalyst for more hydrogen production and less CO production from DME. DME steam reforming over the catalyst at 275°C showed the following data; DME conversion: 95%, yield of H2: 95%, and CO concentration: 0.8mol.%. We have developed some outstanding new catalysts that produce hydrogen from DME at the low reforming temperature.",
