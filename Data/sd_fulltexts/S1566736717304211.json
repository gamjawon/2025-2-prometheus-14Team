In this work, hollow-structured MnO x and FeO x -MnO x were synthesized by self-template route and applied for CO oxidation. FeO x -MnO x exhibited better catalytic activity than MnO x . It could convert 79.1% CO at 20°C and had a higher CO conversion during the temperature ramping. The FeO x species could react with HCl and greatly helped to increase the specific surface area (428.5m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.82cm3 g−1) of the catalyst. The reserved FeO x in the FeO x -MnO x sample enhanced the redox properties and increased the amount of reactive oxygen species.

Image 1 Keywords MnO x Hollow structure Specific surface area Redox properties CO oxidation 1 Introduction MnO x has been extensively researched as an inexpensive and environmental-friendly material applied in catalytic oxidation of CO, NO, VOCs, etc. [1,2]. Given the fact that the morphologies and structure properties could significantly influence the catalytic performance of the material, remarkable progress has been made for the synthesis of MnO x . Various morphologies and phase structures were successfully obtained, including nanostructures (nano-tubes/−belts/−rods/−flakes, etc.) [3–6], ordered mesoporous structures [7], and some hierarchical structures (urchin-like/hollow sphere, etc.) [8–11]. Among the methods for preparing MnO x materials, acid treatment was a simple and effective way to create defects and porous structures [1,12,13]. Si et al. [13] selectively removed La3+ cations from the LaMnO3+ δ perovskite using diluted HNO3 and obtained a γ-MnO2-like material. Such an oxide had a specific surface area of about 250m2 g−1 and showed higher CO oxidation activity than the normal LaMnO3+ δ and γ-MnO2 synthesized by traditional methods. On the other hand, the self-template route using acid solution was a method to synthesize MnO x with hollow structures [14]. Dispersed MnCO3 particles were firstly synthesized and an oxide shell was formed by the oxidation of carbonate using KMnO4. Then the carbonate core was selectively removed by acid solution. The as-prepared hollow MnO x was used in water treatment [15–17], supercapacitors [18], and Li-ion batteries [19,20]. The most attractive feature of the hollow MnO x prepared by such a self-template method was their high surface area. Cao et al. [17] calcined the samples at 400°C for 4h after acid leaching and got a kind of γ-MnO2/α-MnO2 ellipsoids with a specific surface area of ~100m2 g−1. Yu and co-workers [18] obtained MnO2 hollow structures without calcination and the samples had a specific surface area of about 300m2 g−1. However, few literature were focused on the behavior of manganese carbonate that mixed with other metal elements in the self-template route. A mixed oxide shell should be formed over the carbonate after the reaction with KMnO4. It is, therefore, possible that the specific surface area of the final oxide product would be further increased if some less acid-stable metal oxide such as FeO x and CoO x are chosen. And the physicochemical properties of the base material MnO x may also be tuned. In the present study, we fabricated hollow MnO x and FeO x -MnO x structures with large specific surface areas and evaluated their catalytic performance for CO oxidation. With Fe doping into the carbonate precursor, the specific surface area and pore volume of the final FeO x -MnO x product were remarkably increased. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were also studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of MnOx and FeOx-MnOx In this work, the hollow structures were synthesized in the way that was similar to the literature [15], and a scheme of the preparation was shown in Fig. S1. The MnCO3 and Fe-doped carbonate (Mn/Fe=4/1, denoted as Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3) were served as precursors and they were prepared using MnSO4·H2O (99%, Aladdin, China), FeSO4·7H2O (99%, Aladdin, China), and NaHCO3 (99.8%, Aladdin, China). For the preparation of MnCO3, 0.01mol MnSO4·H2O and 0.01mol NaHCO3 were separately dissolved in 700mL deionized water. Then the NaHCO3 solution was added into the MnSO4 solution under stirring. The mixture was stirred for 12h at room temperature. Finally, the suspension was filtered and washed with deionized water, followed by drying at 80°C in an oven overnight. For the preparation of Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3, 0.008mol MnSO4·H2O and 0.002mol FeSO4·7H2O were dissolved to form a homogeneous solution. The following steps were same to those of the preparation of MnCO3. For the preparation of MnO x and FeO x -MnO x , 1g of the as-prepared precursor of MnCO3 or Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3 was dispersed in 40mL deionized water. Then 5mL KMnO4 solution (0.032mol L−1) was added under stirring. After being reacted for 40min, 5mL HCl solution (2.4mol L−1) was added into the above solution, and the suspension was stirred for another 2min. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times and dried at 110°C overnight. Finally, the products were calcined in a muffle furnace at 300°C for 3h in static air. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The bulk compositions of the catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to determine the phase structures. The morphologies and sizes of the samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pore volume and specific surface area were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption experiments. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to get the surface properties. The redox properties were measured by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). All of the characterizations mentioned above can be found in detail in our previous work [1,21,22]. 2.3 CO catalytic oxidation tests The CO catalytic oxidation activity was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 12mm. 50mg catalyst was put into the reactor and fixed by quartz wool on both ends. Before each test, the catalyst was pretreated at 300°C for 30min in 10% O2/N2 (100mL min−1). Then the reactant gas mixture (5000ppm CO, 10% O2, balanced with N2) was introduced into the reactor system, with a total flow rate of 100mL min−1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 120,000mL gcat −1 h−1. The temperature was increased from 20 to 250°C with a heating rate of 10°C min−1. The component concentrations in the effluent gas were detected by a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Thermal Nicolet iS10) with a spectral resolution of 0.5cm−1. The pretreatment and temperature ramping test were performed twice for each catalyst and the CO conversion was calculated according to (1-[CO]outlet/[CO]inlet)×100%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structures and morphologies The XRD patterns of the two carbonates in Fig. S2 show sharp characteristic peaks of rhombohedral MnCO3 phase (JCPDS No. 44–1472) without any impurities [18]. The diffraction peaks of Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3 slightly shift to higher angle positions; this indicates that the Fe ions are doping into the carbonate structure since the radius of Fe2+ (0.65Å) is smaller than that of Mn2+ (0.83Å) [23]. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1(a) correspond to the oxides derived from the carbonate precursors. They both match the pattern of the birnessite MnO2 (JCPDS No. 18–0802) [18,24,25]. The peaks centered at 2θ=36.9° and 66.0° could be well assigned to the (006) and (119) planes of MnO2. However, the low intensities and broadening of the peaks reveal an amorphous or poorly ordered polycrystalline nature of the catalysts. For the XPS spectra of Mn 2p in Fig. 1(b), the two catalysts have very similar spectra and two peaks centered at 653.9 and 642.3eV can be found in each of the spectra, which are assigned to the Mn 2p 1/2 and Mn 2p 3/2, respectively. That further proves the dominance of MnO2 in the catalysts [24,25]. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the oxides. As can be seen from their overall appearance in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the samples preserve the shapes and sizes of MnCO3 and Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3 precursors. The hollow structures of the MnO x and FeO x -MnO x were created after the acid treatment. Some of the broken samples present the “shell-like” appearance, and the cavity inside the shell can be clearly seen in the magnified SEM images as insets in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The surface of the shells consists of a lot of curly sheets with a thickness in nanoscale. The formation of the oxide shells and nano-sheets proceeded simultaneously during the reaction between KMnO4 and carbonates [16]. For clearly explaining the formation of such a characterized morphology, more microscopic images are given in the “Supporting Information”. Fig. S3 presents the typical SEM images of the MnCO3 and Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3 particles. The MnCO3 particles have a uniform solid spherical morphology with an average size of ~3.5μm. After doping Fe into the carbonate, the particles tend to grow into elliptic shapes which are not standard spheres, with a size ranging from 4 to 6μm. As shown in Fig. S3(b), the surface of the as-prepared MnCO3 microsphere is composed of triangular edges and corners. It seems like that in the solution the crystals are in a radially growing method to form MnCO3. As for the high-magnification image of Fe0.2Mn0.8CO3 in Fig. S3(d), it looks different with that of MnCO3, suggesting that the addition of Fe changes the assembling process of the crystals. TEM images in Fig. S4 further confirm the morphology results of the obtained MnO x and FeO x -MnO x catalysts. Fig. S4(a) and (d) show that the hollow structures of the MnO x and FeO x -MnO x are distinct with the average shell thickness of 360 and 520nm, respectively. The extended and curly thin pieces can also be clearly observed to compose the oxide shells in the magnified TEM images in Fig. S4(b) and (e). The fringes displayed in Fig. S4(c) and (f) both have a spacing distance of 0.24nm, which is assigned to the (006) planes of the birnessite MnO2 [25,26]. 3.2 N2 adsorption/desorption and surface properties Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the associated pore size distributions of the two catalysts. They both have a type IV isotherm with hysteresis loops of type H3. The hysteresis loops are in the region of P/P 0 >0.4 for both catalysts, which is due to the mesoporous structures resulted from the interleaved nano-sheets [21]. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the pore size distributions of the catalysts based on BJH method. The most probable pore diameters of MnO x and FeO x -MnO x are 3.3 and 3.8nm, respectively, which further confirms their mesoporous structures. FeO x -MnO x has larger specific surface area and pore volume, i.e., 428.5m2 g−1 and 0.82cm3 g−1, respectively. The specific surface area and the pore volume of MnO x are 278.3m2 g−1 and 0.51cm3 g−1, respectively. 3.3 Catalytic activities for CO oxidation Fig. 4 shows the light-off curves for CO oxidation obtained from the second run. As can be observed, the two catalysts both perform excellent CO oxidation activity with the light-off temperature T50 (temperature of 50% CO conversion) below 30°C. FeO x -MnO x displays a better activity; the CO conversion can reach 79.1% even at 20°C and 90.0% at only 50°C. In contrast, MnO x has a higher T90 (temperature of 90% CO conversion) of 145°C. The XRD patterns of the used samples after activity tests are displayed in Fig. S5. The patterns are almost the same with those of the fresh samples, demonstrating the phase structure were stable during the CO catalytic oxidation. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum in the inset of Fig. 5 proves that the Fe element is in oxidation states. The atomic ratio of Fe/Mn determined by ICP, EDS, and XPS are 0.10, 0.08, and 0.12, respectively, which are lower than the designed ratio of 0.25. It means that the acid solution not only reacted with the carbonate core of the samples but also leached away some of the FeO x in the oxide shell, resulting in much higher specific surface area and pore volume. According to the literature [2,28], the surface Mn4+ ions should be the active sites for CO oxidation. CO molecules preferred to abstract oxygen atoms in the neighboring of these sites to form CO2, and the consumed oxygen was immediately supplemented by the oxygen in the gas phase. The EDS mapping results in Fig. S6 demonstrate that the FeO x species distribute well in FeO x -MnO x . These remained FeO x species might also affect the properties of the catalyst. The H2-TPR results in Fig. 5 show that the two main peaks of FeO x -MnO x , which are correlated to the reduction of Mn ions [27–29], shift to lower temperatures than those of MnO x . This proves that FeO x -MnO x owns better redox properties than MnO x . Moreover, the shoulder peaks of FeO x -MnO x presented at ~143 and ~199°C, which are assigned to the reduction of easily reduced oxygen species [2,27–29], have higher intensities than those of MnO x , indicating that more reactive oxygen species exist in FeO x -MnO x . Overall, FeO x -MnO x exhibits better redox properties and more reactive oxygen species, which could benefit the CO oxidation reaction. 4 Conclusion In this work, the MnO x and FeO x -MnO x hollow structures were fabricated using carbonates as precursors and applied to CO oxidation. They both showed a mesoporous structure with most probable pore diameters of 3.3 and 3.8nm, respectively. The presence of FeO x in the oxide shell over the carbonate had two promoting effects for the catalyst. Firstly, some of the FeO x was leached away, resulting in a specific surface area of 428.5m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.82cm3 g−1, both of which were over 1.5 times those of the MnO x . Secondly, the reserved FeO x enhanced the redox properties of the catalyst, resulting in more reactive oxygen species in FeO x -MnO x . The higher specific surface area and optimized redox properties were responsible for the superior CO catalytic oxidation activity of FeO x -MnO x .
