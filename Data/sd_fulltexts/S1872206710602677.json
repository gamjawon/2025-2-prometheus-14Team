AL-FATESH, Anis. H. FAKEEHA, Ahmed. E. ABASAEED* Chemical Engineering Department, College of Engineering, King Saud University, P.O. Box 800, Riyadh 1142, Saudi Arabia Abstract: The Ni catalysts supported on È–-Al 2 O 3 were synthesized by an impregnation method. Their catalytic performance in methane dry reforming was investigated. The reforming reactions were carried out in a microreactor using a CO 2 :CH 4 feed ratio of 1:1, a F/W = 2640 ml/(hÂ·g), reaction temperatures between 500â€“850 qC, and at atmospheric pressure. The influence of Ca, Ce, and Zr promoters on catalyst stability, coke deposition, and the H 2 /CO ratio were also studied. Effluents were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The spent and fresh catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 promoted with 0.15% Ce and 0.05% Ca gave the best performance and resulted in less coke formation. The highest CH 4 and CO 2 conversion activities were found to be 94.1% and 98.3% at 850 qC, respectively. Stability tests were carried out for 130 h and this provided a H 2 yield of 91%. Moreover, the amount of formed carbon was negligible and did not increase to more than 1.5 wt%. Key words: methane, dry reforming; coke; nickel; synthesis gas; stability The carbon dioxide reforming of CH 4 , also known as dry reforming, has received a large amount of attention because of its positive industrial and environmental impact. CH 4 and CO 2 are greenhouse gases that cause the warming of the earth and climate change. These two gases can be consumed by reform- ing reactions leading to a significant reduction in their con- centrations in the atmosphere [1,2]. The primary products are H 2 and CO, which are suitable for industrial processes such as methanol, dimethyl ether, or Fisher-Tropsch reactions [3â€“9]. Fisher-Tropsch has been recognized as an important alternate technology to petroleum refining [10]. The main process reac- tions include: CO 2 + CH 4 Ä¼ 2CO + 2H 2 (1) CO 2 + H 2 Ä¼ CO + H 2 O (2) The major drawback of the reforming process is the rapid coke deposition that causes catalyst deactivation, catalyst de- struction, and/or reactor blockage. The coke originates mainly from two reactions: 2CO Ä¼ C + CO 2 Â¨H 0 298 = â€“172 kJ/mol (3) The reaction is exothermic and is favored at temperatures below 700 o C and at higher pressures. CH 4 Ä¼ C + 2H 2 Â¨H 0 298 = 75 kJ/mol (4) The methane decomposition reaction is endothermic and is favored by high temperatures and low pressures. Carbon for- mation by CH 4 decomposition is a structure sensitive reaction [2]. Several investigators have attributed catalyst instability and deactivation in reforming reactions to coke formation [10â€“13]. Numerous supported metal catalysts have been evaluated (Ni, Rh, Ru, Ir, Pd, and Pt) for this process [14â€“22]. Their catalytic performance can be affected by many factors such as promoters and operating conditions [23â€“28]. The in- corporation of small amounts of oxygen to the feed was found to have significant effects on catalyst stability, carbon forma- tion, and methane conversion for low CO 2 to CH 4 feed ratios [29â€“31]. Bellido et al. [32] investigated the effect of adding CaO to the ZrO 2 support on nickel catalyst activity for the dry re- forming of methane. During the characterization of the catalyst containing the oxide precursor (NiO) they found a tetragonal phase consisting of CaO-ZrO 2 solid solutions. They also ob- served that the electrical properties of the support have a pro- portional effect on catalytic activity. Moreover, a direct relation was found between variations in the electrical conductivity of the support and the nickel species supported on it. Oez- kara-Aydinoglu et al. [33] investigated the dry reforming of Ahmed. S. A. AL-FATESH et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1604â€“1609 methane over Pt/ZrO 2 catalysts promoted with Ce at different temperatures and feed compositions. They investigated the influence of the impregnation strategy and the amount of ce- rium on the activity and stability of the catalyst. They found that the introduction of 1% Ce to the Pt/ZrO 2 catalyst via co-impregnation led to the optimum catalytic activity and stability. The reason for the high activity was the intensive interaction between Pt and Ce phases in the co-impregnated sample. Chen et al. [34] studied a Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 solid solution supported Ru catalysts for CH 4 -CO 2 reforming. The effect of Ru content on the properties of the catalysts was investigated by N 2 adsorption-desorption, H 2 -TPR/MS, XRD, XPS, CO chemisorption, and H 2 -TPD/MS. The highly dispersed Ru species was found to favor the interaction between Ru and Ce 0.75 Zr 0.25 O 2 and contributed positively to catalyst activity and stability, and it provided excellent resistance to carbon deposi- tion during reforming. Much effort has been put into the development of metal catalysts that provide high catalytic performance for synthesis gas formation and that are also resistant to carbon deposition. They are expected to provide a stable long-term operation. Thermodynamic consideration suggests that operation at high temperatures is required to minimize carbon formation in the CO 2 reforming of methane [35]. Transition elements combined with a Ce promoter have at- tracted the attention of researchers because of their high oxy- gen storage capacity [36]. It has been established that the elimination of lattice oxygen in Ce oxide under reducing con- ditions produces anionic vacancies that can be correlated to high lattice oxygen mobility. These oxygen vacancy defects are considered to be reactive sites on the surfaces of metal oxides [37,38]. The objective of this study is to develop supported Ni-based catalysts that maintain high activity and stability while mini- mizing the formation of coke during the dry reforming of methane. We investigated the effect of promoters and reaction temperatures on the activity, stability, and coke formation of Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Various characterization techniques were employed to substantiate the findings. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalysts Wet impregnation was used to prepare the catalysts. Sup- ported Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared using nickel nitrate salt (Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O) as a precursor and high surface area alumina (SA-6175, A BET = 230 m 2 /g) as a support. Precursors for the Ce, Ca, and Zr promoters were cerous nitrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O), calcium nitrate (Ca(NO 3 ) 2 Â·4H 2 O), and zir- conium nitrate (Zr(NO 3 ) 4 Â·5H 2 O), respectively. The catalyst was dried for 10 h at 120 qC and calcined at 900 qC for 2 h. The catalysts were then activated inside the reactor at 700 qC by passing hydrogen at a rate of 40 ml/min for 2 h followed by 20 min of N 2 at a rate of 30 ml/min. 1.2 Methane dry reforming reaction The CO 2 reforming of methane was carried out at atmos- pheric pressure in a 9.4 mm i.d. and 48 cm long stainless steel fixed-bed microreactor (Zeton Altamira 2000) packed with 0.75 g of the catalyst. The reaction temperature was measured by a thermocouple placed at the center of the catalyst bed. The volume ratio of the feed gases (CH 4 :CO 2 :N 2 ) was 5:5:1. The total flow rate was 33 ml/min with a space velocity of 2640 ml/(hÂ·g). The investigation covered the reaction temperatures of 500, 600, 700, 800, and 850 qC. Effluents were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Varian Star cx 3400) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. We calculated conversions, H 2 /CO ratio, yields, and the de- activation factor (DF) according to the following formulae: in out in 444 in out in 222 CH conversion (%) (CH CH ) / CH 100 CO conversion (%) (CO CO ) / CO 100 u u 2 H mole of H produced CO mole of CO produced out 2 2 in 4 mole of H Hyield (%) 100 2 mole of CHu 4 4 FinalCH conversion InitialCH conversion DF InitialCH conversion 1.3 Characterization of the catalysts The catalysts (before and after the reaction) were charac- terized by different techniques. To investigate carbon deposi- tion the morphology of the catalysts was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM- 6360A). The amount of surface carbon was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) in an air atmosphere at up to 800 qC on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Dia- mond thermogravimetric-differential analyzer TG/DTA 6300 at a heating rate 20 qC/min. 2 Results and discussion A blank experiment without a catalyst and with only quartz wool at 800 Â°C showed a CH 4 conversion of less than 2%. In an earlier investigation the optimum Ni loading for the highest catalyst activity and the lowest amount of coking was a 3% Ni loading [39] and the optimum calcination temperature was 900 Â°C [40]. 2.1 Effect of promoters on the 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst Promoters such as ceria or other rare earth metal oxides can Ahmed. S. A. AL-FATESH et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1604â€“1609 improve the behavior of nickel based catalysts since they possess a higher oxygen storage capacity and therefore con- tribute to the inhibition of carbon formation. The catalytic performance of the Ca, Zr, and Ce-promoted 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst are presented in Table 1. The initial and final conversions of methane and carbon dioxide for the unpromoted 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst changed from 73.7% to 73.0% and 80.1% to 79.0%, respectively. The calculated deactivation factor and coke were â€“0.95% and 6.9%, respectively. For the catalysts promoted with 0.05% and 0.15% calcium there was no significant enhancement in the conver- sions of methane and carbon dioxide (< 2%). A significant drop in carbon formation (from 6.9% to 4.1%) and a drop in the deactivation factor (from â€“0.95% to â€“0.54%) were observed upon increasing the Ca content to 0.15%. However, for the 0.30% Ca-promoter, the conversion of methane dropped slightly by 2.5% initially and 3.2% after 9 h on stream, and for the same time intervals the conversion of CO 2 increased by 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Upon increasing the calcium con- tent to 0.30% the Ca-promoted catalyst gave a lower H 2 /CO ratio (0.79) and higher carbon formation (9.2%) compared with the unpromoted catalyst at 0.91% and 6.9%, respectively. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained by Hou et al. [41] who showed that the presence of small quanti- ties of Ca in the Ni/D-Al 2 O 3 catalyst enhanced catalyst activity and stability; however, the methane decomposition reaction is favored at a higher Ca content. The 0.15% Ca-promoted cata- lyst gave the lowest deactivation factor and coke deposition of â€“0.54% and 4.1%, respectively, and the H 2 /CO ratio was prac- tically unaffected. Upon promoting the catalyst with 0.05% Zr, the conversion of methane showed insignificant change (73.4% to 73.0%). However, carbon dioxide showed an 8% drop in conversion from 83.3% to 76.7%. The calculated deactivation factor and coke deposition were â€“0.55% and 6.4%, respectively. When the catalyst was promoted with 0.15% Zr the conversions of methane and carbon dioxide varied from 72.3% to 71.0% and 82.3% to 79.1%, respectively. The calculated deactivation factor and coke were â€“1.8% and 9.2%, respectively. The addi- tion of 0.15% Zr to the catalyst did not result in an improve- ment in activity or carbon formation; however, upon increasing the amount of promoter to 0.30% the conversions of methane and carbon dioxide dropped by 4.4% (from 75.2% to 71.9%) and by 7.1% (from 81.2% to 75.4%), respectively. The calcu- lated deactivation factor and coke were 4.4% and 12.4%, re- spectively. Compared with the unpromoted catalyst, the initial conversion of CH 4 increased, however, the final CO 2 conver- sion decreased. As is evident from Table 1, the 0.05% of Zr- promoted catalyst was less prone to carbon deposition. How- ever, as the Zr content was further increased more carbon deposition was observed. For the Ce-promoted catalyst the initial and final conver- sions of methane and carbon dioxide obtained during the time on stream experiments varied from 74.5% to 73.8% and 82.8% to 81.4%, respectively. The calculated deactivation factor and coke were â€“0.94% and 6.4%, respectively. Increasing the Ce content to 0.15% improved the conversions of both methane and carbon dioxide to 76.1% and 84.9%, respectively, at the expense of the H 2 /CO ratio (from 0.91 to 0.86) and more car- bon deposition (8.9% compared with 6.9%). A further increase in the Ce content to 0.30% resulted in lower activity (74% for CH 4 and 84.2% for CO 2 ), a lower H 2 /CO ratio (0.80), and higher coke deposition (10.4%), and thus a higher deactivation factor (â€“1.4%) compared with the 0.15% Ce-promoted cata- lyst. Therefore, the 0.15% Ce-promoted catalyst was chosen for further modification by the addition of different amounts of Ca and Zr, and the results are given in Table 2. When 0.05% Ca was added to the 0.15% Ce-promoted catalyst matrix the ac- tivity did not change significantly, however, the amount of deposited coke was reduced by 69% (from 8.9% to 2.5%) and lower deactivation factors were obtained (â€“0.9% vs. â€“1.3%). The final CO 2 conversion was lower (81.9%) compared with the Ce-only promoted catalyst (84.5%). A higher H 2 /CO ratio was obtained with the 0.05% Ca-doped catalyst (0.91) com- pared with the undoped catalyst (0.86). Upon increasing the Ca content to 0.10% the activity remained the same but the amount Table 1 Catalytic performance of the Ca, Zr, and Ce-promoted 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst X(CH 4 )/% X(CO 2 )/% Promoter Initial a Final b Initial a Final b H 2 /CO ratio c Coke d (%) DF (%) â€” 73.7 73.0 80.1 79.0 0.91 6.9 0.95 0.05%Ca 74.1 73.6 81.8 80.3 0.91 6.0 0.67 0.15%Ca 74.4 74.0 80.8 79.4 0.92 4.1 0.54 0.30%Ca 71.8 70.7 83.7 83.0 0.79 9.2 1.50 0.05%Zr 73.4 73.0 83.3 76.7 0.84 6.4 0.55 0.15%Zr 72.3 71.0 82.3 79.1 0.87 9.2 1.80 0.30%Zr 75.2 71.9 81.2 75.4 0.93 12.4 4.40 0.05%Ce 74.5 73.8 82.8 81.4 0.82 6.4 0.94 0.15%Ce 76.1 75.1 84.9 84.5 0.86 8.9 1.30 0. 3%Ce 74.0 73.0 84.2 80.1 0.80 10.4 1.40 Reaction temperature: F/W = 2640 ml/(hÂ·g), 700 o C, CH 4 15 ml/min, CO 2 15 ml/min, N 2 3 ml/min, catalyst 0.75 g, Calcination temperature 900 o C. a 0.5 h on stream; b 9 h on stream; c Average data during time on stream; d Determined by TGA.

Ahmed. S. A. AL-FATESH et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1604â€“1609 of coke was reduced to less than one half. Upon doping the 0.15% Ce-promoted catalyst with 0.05% Zr, the initial activity did not change significantly. However, the final CO 2 conver- sion dropped significantly (> 11%) and carbon deposition increased by 37%. Upon a further increase in the amount of Zr to 0.10%, the final activity of the catalyst (especially for CO 2 ) deteriorated appreciably and more carbon deposition was evi- dent (increased by 85.4%). It is clear from data presented in Tables 1 and 2 that the Zr-containing catalysts are more prone to carbon formation. Therefore, by considering all these fac- tors, especially carbon formation, the (3%Ni+0.15%Ce+ 0.05%Ca)/È–-Al 2 O 3 was selected for further investigation. The addition of Ca and Ce oxides to the catalyst increased its Lewis basicity leading to an enhanced absorption of CO 2 resulting in higher stability and lower carbon deposition. 2.2 Effect of reaction temperature on the (3%Ni+ 0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca)/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst The effect of temperature on the activity and stability of the catalyst for the methane reforming reaction with carbon diox- ide was conducted for 9, 105, and 130 h on stream at five dif- ferent reaction temperatures (500, 600, 700, 800, and 850 qC) as presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Table 3. Figure 1 shows the conversions of CH 4 and CO 2 respectively at 500, 600, and 700 qC over a period of 9 h. Figure 2 shows the stability test results at 800 and 850 qC. It is clear that this catalyst is stable. The results in Table 3 (only initial and final conversions of Figs. 1 and 2) show that the initial and final conversions of the reac- tants (CH 4 and CO 2 ) and the yields of H 2 and CO increase with temperature. The initial methane and carbon dioxide conver- sions reached 91.0% and 93.6%, respectively, and the H 2 and CO yields were 0.87 and 0.88 respectively at a reaction tem- perature of 800 qC and for a time on stream of 105 h. Upon a further increase in the reaction temperature to 850 qC and with a longer duration (130 h) the initial methane and carbon diox- ide conversions increased to 94.1% and 98.3%, respectively. The H 2 and CO yields were 0.91 and 0.92 respectively giving a H 2 /CO ratio of 0.99. The conversion of carbon dioxide was found to be higher than that of methane and the H 2 /CO ratios are similar indicating the dominance of the water gas shift reaction (CO 2 + H 2 Äº CO + H 2 O). The CO 2 reaction consumed H 2 and the reduced carbon deposition on the catalyst was due to steam formation. As is evident from Table 3, the synthesis gas ratio increased with reaction temperature. Coke formation was relatively high at lower reaction temperatures (500 to 800 qC). However, upon increasing the reaction temperature to 850 qC, coke formation 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 30 90 150 210 270 330 390 450 510 570 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 C H 4 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) 500 o C 600 o C 700 o C (a) C O 2 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Time on stream (min) 500 o C 600 o C 700 o C (b) Fig. 1.

S. A. AL-FATESH et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1604â€“1609 decreased even over longer periods of time on stream (130 h). The decrease in coke can be attributed to the increased rate of coke removal by gasification agents such as H 2 O and CO 2 during the reaction (C + H 2 O Äº CO + H 2 ). The developed supported catalyst was characterized by its resistance to coke formation. The TG curves for the spent catalysts described in Table 1 (3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 , 3%Ni+ 0.15%Ce/È–-Al 2 O 3 ) and Table 2 (3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca/ È–-Al 2 O 3 ) are shown in Fig. 3. The profiles of the three spent catalysts show mass losses of 6.9%, 8.9%, and 2.5%, respec- tively, at a reaction temperature of 700 qC. These results con- firm the supremacy of the catalyst promoted with Ce and Ca (3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca/È–-Al 2 O 3 ) with regard to carbon formation and catalyst stability. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of the fresh (3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 ) and the spent 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 , 3%Ni+0.15%Ce/È–-Al 2 O 3 , and 3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The used 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 and 3%Ni+0.15%Ce/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalysts show a considerable amount of carbon deposition. However, the spent 3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was almost iden- tical to the fresh catalyst indicating the absence of coke for- mation. This further confirms our previous findings regarding this catalyst, and it is thus industrially preferable to use 3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05w%Ca/È–-Al 2 O 3 at temperatures higher than 800 qC. 3 Conclusions Dry reforming of CH 4 to produce CO-rich synthesis gas was investigated. Promoters such as Ca, Ce, and Zr were used for the preparation of supported catalysts. Carbon deposition was the major factor that influenced catalyst activity and stability. CH 4 and CO 2 conversions increased with an increase in the reaction temperature. The lowest coke formation and the best stability were obtained at 800 and 850 qC. Based on catalyst stability, Ce was found to be the best promoter for the 3%Ni/È–-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The addition of Ca to the Ce-promoted catalyst with the following composition (3%Ni+0.15%Ce+ 0.05%Ca/È–-Al 2 O 3 ) gave the best activity and stability results. Moreover, the same catalyst gave the lowest amount of coke formation as confirmed by TGA and SEM. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 M a s s Temperature ( o C) 3%Ni/J-Al 2 O 3 Mass loss = 6.9% 3%Ni+0.15%Ce/J-Al 2 O 3 Mass loss = 8.9% 3%Ni+0.15%Ce+0.05%Ca/J-Al 2 O 3 Mass loss = 2.5% Fig. 3.

Tel: +966-50-7275840; Fax: +966-1-4676856 The Ni catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 were synthesized by an impregnation method. Their catalytic performance in methane dry reforming was investigated. The reforming reactions were carried out in a microreactor using a CO2:CH4 feed ratio of 1:1, a F/W = 2640 ml/(h·g), reaction temperatures between 500-850 (C, and at atmospheric pressure. The influence of Ca, Ce, and Zr promoters on catalyst stability, coke deposition, and the H2/CO ratio were also studied. Effluents were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The spent and fresh catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that 3%Ni/γ-Al2O3 promoted with 0.15% Ce and 0.05% Ca gave the best performance and resulted in less coke formation. The highest CH4 and CO2 conversion activities were found to be 94.1% and 98.3% at 850 (C, respectively. Stability tests were carried out for 130 h and this provided a H2 yield of 91%. Moreover, the amount of formed carbon was negligible and did not increase to more than 1.5 wt%.
