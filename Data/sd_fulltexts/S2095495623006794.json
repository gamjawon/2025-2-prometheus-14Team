Graphical abstract The formation process of Pd single atoms synthesized by the thermally melting Pd nanoparticles on an oxygen-vacancy-rich tungsten-oxide matrix at reduction atmosphere was investigated by near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-obtained zero-valence Pd single-atom catalyst exhibits a markedly boosted HER activity than Pd nanoparticles. Surface-supported isolated atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs) grant maximum utilization of metals in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report a feasible pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Pd single atoms by thermally melting Pd nanoparticles on an oxygen-vacancy-rich tungsten-oxide matrix at reduction atmosphere. Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to monitor the formation of zero-valence Pd single atoms and the increased metallic feature of WO3− x substrate. Accordingly, the as-obtained zero-valence Pd single-atom catalyst exhibits a markedly boosted HER activity with a low overpotential (η 10 = 70 mV) at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope (b = 68 mV/dec), nearly 150 mV and a 3.0-fold enhancement than those of Pd nanoparticles (η 10 = 220 mV, b = 133 mV/dec) under the same conditions. In addition, quasi in situ XPS results suggest the hydrogen spillover effect is more likely to occur on Pd single atoms during the electrochemical process. Our work may pave an interesting route for the rational design of highly-efficient single-atom catalysts, and the elucidation of corresponding enhanced reaction mechanisms by the utilization of advanced characterization techniques. Keywords Pd WO3− x Single-atom catalysts NAP-XPS HER 1 Introduction Hydrogen has long been advocated as one of the most promising alternatives to traditional fossil fuels because of its features of high gravimetric energy density and environmental friendly [1]. Water electrolysis driven by renewable energy is a promising approach for hydrogen production without any carbon emission, very satisfying the global mission of carbon neutrality. Balogun et al. reported extensively important progress of catalyst exploration in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For example, they demonstrated a simple but feasible method to fabricate the Co-based nitride/oxide interstitial compound phase boundaries on stainless steel mesh (Mo-Co5.47N/N-CoO), which only demands the HER overpotential of 28 mV@10 mA/cm2 in an alkaline medium, and is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density >44 mA/cm2 in acidic medium [2]. Further, they developed heterogeneous Mo2N/Ni3Mo3N electrocatalysts on nickel foam (denoted MN-NMN/NF), which maintained HER current densities of 10 and 500 mA/cm2 only using low overpotentials of 9.37 and 123 mV in 1.0 M KOH seawater electrolyte, respectively [3]. In addition, they also confirmed nickel nitride compounds are very proficient in water electrolysis for hydrogen production [4,5]. Among pH-universal HER process, acidic HER process holds some notable advantages of compact device, high current density, high-pressure compatibility and so forth, which affords it with wide applications in proton [6,7]. While noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd) are regarded as the benchmark catalyst in acidic electrolyte due to the favorable chemical/electronic interactions between noble metal atoms and protons [8,9], the catalytic efficiency is largely affected by the kinetics of proton migration from electrolyte to noble metal catalyst surfaces [10]. Therefore, the exploration of highly efficient catalyst with reversible behaviors of proton adsorption and desorption towards the construction of proton-rich environment around noble metal sites is valuable but challenging [11]. The flexible oxygen content affords tungsten oxides with wide range of valence states (0–+6) and flexible electronic structures, in particular, featured by strong solid-acid property, tungsten oxides are expected to serve as proton transfer relays. Tungsten oxides can be capable of high-density hydrogen insertion and extraction with the formation of hydrogen tungsten bronze (H x WO3) species [12,13], which also implies that tungsten oxides may be ideal substrates to support and stabilize noble metal materials for boosted HER activity in acidic electrolyte. Especially, in cases noble metals are in single-atom state because of nearly 100% atom utilization and unique chemical and electronic properties of the single-atom catalysts [14,15]. Extensive low-cost single-atom catalysts have been utilized in various electrocatalysis for highly-efficient catalytic reactions. For the application in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), Shui et al. reported a short review demonstrating that Fe single atoms supported by nitrogen doped carbon matrix (denoted as Fe-N-C) can achieve highly active and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process [16]. Zhang et al. proposed a feasible regeneration of deactivated Fe-N-C single atoms for highly-efficient acidic ORR process [17]. For the utilization of cobalt-based single-atom catalysts in air batteries, Cao et al. reported the use of Co tetra (phenyl)porphyrin 1 and Co tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 2 as models to probe the role of Co-N4/C sites for highly-active oxygen electrocatalysis [18]. Zhang and co-workers pointed out that the clicking confinement strategy is a simple and effective method to tailor the Co-N-C single atoms as highly-active bifunctional oxygen-involved electrocatalysts in metal-air battery [19]. Therefore, single-atom catalysts can be selected to be an ideal platform to achieve highly-efficient electrocatalytic reactions. Downsizing metal nanoparticles into atomic-level species by pyrolyzing the nanoparticle counterparts has been proven to be an effective strategy for improving the catalytic activities of metal atoms in catalysis [20–22]. Although environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) has been widely used in the direct observation of the evolution of melting nanoparticles into single-atom state [23–25], the detection of the subtle change of chemical and electronic structures in metal species is still lacking, which undoubtedly causes a negative effect on the establishment of catalytic models and subsequent analysis of reaction mechanism. Therefore, it will be valuable to further develop advanced characterization techniques to in situ monitor the evolution of chemical and electronic structures during the pyrolysis process of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we report a feasible pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Pd single atoms by thermally melting Pd nanoparticles on an oxygen-vacancy-rich tungsten oxide (WO3− x , 0 < x < 3) substrate at a reduction atmosphere [26]. In situ variable-temperature near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) demonstrates the formation of unique zero valence Pd single atoms and increased metallic feature of WO3− x substrate, both are beneficial for subsequent HER process in acidic electrolyte. Accordingly, the as-obtained zero-valence Pd single-atom catalyst exhibits a markedly boosted HER activity with a low overpotential (η 10 = 70 mV) at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope (b = 68 mV/dec), nearly 150 mV and a 3.0-fold enhancement than those of Pd nanoparticles (η 10 = 220 mV, b = 133 mV/dec) under the same conditions. Moreover, the desired single-atom catalyst shows an unexceptional stability with no obvious activity degradation over 20 h of hydrogen production, evidencing the excellent reversible behaviors of hydrogen insertion and extraction in the tungsten-oxide substrate, which is also evidenced by the quasi in situ electrochemical measurement in vacuum-connected glove-box (electrochemical work station) and NAP-XPS equipment. Our work may pave an interesting route to maximize the catalytic efficiency of single-atom catalysts and elucidate their formation and electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms by using advanced characterization techniques. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Tungsten chloride (WCl6, 99.0%, Aladdin), palladium (II) acetate (Pd(O2CCH3)2, AR, Shanghai Kefeng Chemical Reagent Co., LTD.), Nafion 117 containing solution (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (Anhydrous, ≥99.7%, General-reagent), and ethanol (Anhydrous, ≥99.7%, General-reagent) were used in the experiment. 2.2 Synthesis of Pd/WO3−x WO3− x was prepared using a modified procedure according to the previous report [27]. In detail, 1000 mg WCl6 and 30 mg Pd(O2CCH3)2 were initially dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) in a vial. A mixture solution of deionized water (DI) (0.5 mL) and ethanol (10 mL) was prepared in a separate vial. All solutions mentioned above were cooled in an ice bath for 2 h with continuous stirring for the uniform distribution of Pd species into tungsten oxide matrix. The W and Pd precursors were then mixed with an ethanol–water mixture to form a solution. Afterwards, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed by water, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The synthesized Pd/WO3− x powder was then thermally annealed with 5% H2/Ar or Ar at the specified temperature (Scheme S1). For comparison, pure WO3− x was obtained by using the same synthetic procedure without the addition of Pd source. 2.3 Characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out by a Bruker AXS D8 Advance using Cu Kα radiation target with scanning angle (2θ) in the range 15°–75°. Raman spectra were collected by a LABRAM HR spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with an excitation laser of 532 nm. The morphology of materials was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). Atomic-level high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images and the corresponding STEM-Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps were measured on an FEI Titan Themis Z 3.1 equipped with a SCOR spherical aberration corrector and a monochromator. In situ variable-temperature XPS measurements were performed using a SPECS NAP-XPS with atmosphere pressure ranging from the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) to near ambient pressure (25 mbar), where the thermal treatment was conducted by an equipped temperature-controllable laser heating device and thermocouple. The photon source is the monochromatic X-ray source of Al Kα (1486.6 eV), with overall spectra resolution of Ag 3d 5/2, <0.5 eV FWHM at 20 kcps in UHV condition. In a typical practice, 30 mg of the powder samples were molded and fixed on a sample holder prior to loading into the spectrometer. The base pressure during UHV spectra acquisition was better than 2 × 10−9 mbar, which was achieved by the Pfeiffer Hipace 700 molecular pumping system. Spectra were collected at the pass energy of 30 eV (0.1 eV step) except survey scans collected at pass energy of 50 eV (1.0 eV step). The area of sample analysis was about 3 mm2. All binding energies were the raw XPS data without further calibration because the samples were sufficiently conductive to allow the reliance on the calibration of the spectrometer alone. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Co., China) using a standard three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, in which a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (diameter 5 mm, area 0.196 cm2), Ag/AgCl electrode, and a carbon rod were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. In a typical synthesis of the catalyst ink, 5 mg of target powder sample was dispersed in a mixture of 800 μL ethanol, 200 μL water, and 30 μL Nafion, followed by sonication for at least 30 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 30 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped onto the polished working electrode and dried naturally for the following measurements. For the quasi in-situ HER measurement, a glove box connected to the NAP-XPS instrument through a vacuum channel was designed for the investigation of HER mechanism. Samples treated by increasing overpotentials were transferred to the analysis chamber for XPS measurements. 3 Results and discussion XRD patterns of the Pd/WO3− x , H2 reduced WO3− x , and H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x are shown in Fig. 1 (a). For general monoclinic tungsten oxide sample, multi typical diffraction peaks of WO3 (JCPDS No. 43–1035) can be observed [28,29]. The XRD pattern of as-obtained defective WO3− x is quite different from that of WO3. With the insertion of hydrogen atoms, tungsten oxide will be transformed to hydrogen bronze H x WO3, and the characteristic diffraction peaks located at 23.5°, 23.8°, 33.5°, and 33.7° corresponded to (100) (010) (110) and (101) facets of H0.33WO3 in H2 reduced WO3− x (JCPDS No. 23–1449), see the black lines. After mixing Pd precursors, Pd/WO3− x maintained the crystal structure of H2 reduced WO3− x . This is consistent with the viewpoint that benefiting from the presence of Pd particles, and the formation of bronzes is possible even at room temperature due to the high mobility of H species in the tungsten oxides [30–32]. Note that the diffraction peak positions of fresh Pd/WO3− x are slightly shifted by about 2° in a larger direction, indicating that the lattice is smaller than that of H2 reduced WO3− x sample. In addition, no characteristic diffraction peak attributable to Pd was detected in the XRD patterns. According to the analysis of ICP-OES, the loading mass of Pd atoms in Pd/WO3− x and H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x samples are determined to be 1.7 wt% and 1.8 wt%, respectively, suggesting the low content of Pd species on tungsten oxide matrix. H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample was synthesized by annealing the fresh Pd/WO3− x at 400 °C under 5% H2/Ar atmospheres, which exhibits the similar crystal structure of H2 reduced WO3− x . Therefore, hydrogen insertion is considered to be the predominant factor affecting the XRD lattice structure of tungsten oxide. The structures of the three samples were also verified by Raman spectra in the frequency range of 100–1300 cm−1 (Fig. 1b). In the low wavenumber region, the band at 129 cm−1 is originated from the W–O–W bending mode, and the band at 256 cm−1 is identified as O–W–O deformation vibrations. The most intensive peaks at 704 and 801 cm−1 are W–O stretching vibrations [33]. The broad band (seen as the black arrow) at around 970 cm−1 is assigned to be the stretching vibration of W=O [34], the decrease of peak intensity at this position is probably caused by the interactions between Pd and WO3− x . Additionally, the peak value is more obvious in fresh WO3− x samples (Fig. S1), which also indicates that the hydrogen can break the W=O bond and partially convert it to W–O bond with heat treatment. The broad signal is almost absent in the H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x , implying the dominant structure of this sample is mainly composed of W–O bond. The morphologies of fresh and H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x samples are observed by TEM. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), there is no clear morphology difference in the fresh and H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x , and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns only exhibit the diffraction rings of tungsten oxide matrix without any signal assigning to the supported Pd species (Fig. S2), indicating the amorphous nature of supported Pd materials. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image can give much closer observation (Fig. 2b), the lattice fringes are clear with a spacing value of 0.396, 0.385, and 0.217 nm, which are very close to the (100) (001) (111) facets of WO3− x , respectively [35]. And it can be discerned that Pd nanoparticles are embedded in the fresh Pd/WO3− x with a size about 10 nm (Fig. S3). As for the WO3− x supported Pd system after treatment under thermally reduction atmosphere, it can be seen from the HRTEM results that no obvious Pd particles gathered at the coastline of H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample, suggesting that Pd may be atomically dispersed on the WO3− x support. The stabilization mechanism of Pd in this work can be explained as that oxygen vacancies are generated under the activation of hydrogen [26], and Pd single atoms preferred to be trapped in the hollow sites near the oxygen vacancies on WO3− x surfaces [36]. Meanwhile, the HAADF-STEM mapping results (Fig. 2c–e) show the homogeneous distribution of Pd atom species on the support. It should be noted that Pd was not detected in EDS spectra (Fig. 2f) of the both samples, which may be due to the low content of Pd. And the high resolution TEM image of the as-synthesized Pd single-atom catalyst can be seen in Fig. S4. Generally, the formation of Pd single atoms deriving from the melting of Pd bulk phase on tungsten oxide matrix can be understood by the dispersion mechanism. In detail, the oxygen atoms of WO3− x matrix are more likely to interact with the unoccupied d states of Pd single metal atoms due to the strong electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) effect [37,38], and the reduction atmosphere provided by H2 gas can further remove the impurities and strength the interaction of metal and support, which will be beneficial for the stabilization of low-valence or zero-valence Pd single atoms. To monitor the evolution of the electronic structures of Pd/WO3− x under H2 atmosphere at a pressure of 0.1 mbar, in-situ variable-temperature NAP-XPS measurements were conducted. The XPS data collected at 25 °C under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) condition, Pd 3d 5/2 located at the binding energy of 335.5 eV is assigned to metallic Pd0 in the fresh Pd/WO3− x . In addition to the Pd metal, the peak at higher binding energy (337.8 eV) is related to the Pd 3d 5/2 of Pd δ + species, which is approximately 1.0 eV higher than the Pd2+ from Pd–O bond. This positive shift suggests the electron transfer of Pd centers to neighboring tungsten oxides, which will result in strong interactions between Pd and tungsten oxide components [39]. Upon H2 activation at 100 °C, the oxidized Pd δ + species were almost absent and reduced to be the typical metallic Pd0, as evidenced by the increase of the single Pd 3d 5/2 peak at 335.5 eV. Subsequently, the spectra of the sample were recorded at the temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 °C under the reduction atmosphere. Fig. 3 (a) shows that the Pd species anchoring on the WO3− x support still maintain the zero valence state, suggesting that Pd is in a balance state of electron gain and loss. Given the TEM results that Pd nanoparticles are almost absent, it suggests that at high temperature Pd may present atomically in the formation of O–Pd–W with zero valence state. In the initial state of W element (Fig. 3b) at room temperature, the binding energy of W 4f core-level signals was mostly dominated by W6+ (35.5 eV for W 4f 7/2 and 37.7 eV for W 4f 5/2). Upon heating with reducible atmosphere, an obvious negative shift of the W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 towards lower binding energies, indicating the fraction of W5+ (34.2 eV for W 4f 7/2 and 36.3 eV for W 4f 5/2) noticeably increases at the expense of that related to W6+ (35.9 eV for W 4f 7/2 and 38.1 eV for W 4f 5/2), the corresponding atomic percentages are shown in Fig. 3(c). During the reduction, the dissociation of H2 proceeds on Pd surfaces and then hydrogen is transported by a spillover process [40–43] to the tungsten oxide surface followed by the penetration throughout the bulk WO3− x to form W–O–H bonds. As the H content increases, more charges are transferred to the O atoms, and the H atoms become more proton-like, resulting in a higher degree of reduction of W6+. In addition to the hydrogen tungsten bronzes, low-valent W5+ containing sub-oxides could also be formed upon reduction with H2 at elevated temperatures. The O 1s XPS patterns are displayed in Fig. S5(a), to further investigate the chemical states of oxygen in Pd/WO3− x reacted with hydrogen, as expected, the atomic ratio of hydroxyl account for the lattice O is increasing, which is 35.5% at room temperature under UHV, and 56.7% after hydrogen activation under 400 °C (Fig. S5b). Due to the activation of hydrogen, zero valence Pd single atoms are generated on WO3− x , which is expected to be able to substantially boost HER activity, and it has been reported that zero valence single-atom metals can greatly improve the HER performance [44]. The HER performance of the as-obtained H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x was measured in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions using a typical three-electrode setup, where the fresh Pd/WO3− x , H2 reduced WO3− x reference catalysts were also examined under identical conditions for comparison (Fig. S6a). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for three as-obtained catalysts were presented in Fig. 4 (a). The H2 reduced WO3− x sample exhibited very poor acidic HER activity with an overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 up to 595 mV, whereas a remarkable enhancement in HER activity was observed for Pd decorated on WO3− x support, indicating the anchored Pd species are the major contributor to the enhanced acidic HER activity. Meanwhile, we also notice that the color of the tungsten-oxide supported Pd electrode turns from yellow to dark blue after HER process, suggesting the formation of low-valence hydrogen tungsten bronze due to the insertion of hydrogen species (Fig. S6b). Among various WO3− x supported materials in our work, the as-obtained H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample showed the best HER performance (η 10 = 70 mV), which largely excels Pd nanoparticles (the fresh Pd/WO3− x ) (η 10 = 220 mV) (Fig. 4a), pure Ar-treated Pd/WO3− x (Fig. S6b, η 10 = 145 mV), and Pd/WO3− x reduced at 250 °C with 5% H2/Ar atmosphere (Fig. S6b, η 10 = 100 mV). These results suggest that more effective modification of the Pd electron properties favoring the hydrogen protons adsorption/hydrogenation in the case of zero valence Pd single atoms coupled on WO3− x support. Besides of the enhanced HER activity, Tafel slopes extracted from corresponding LSV curves also reveal the kinetic information (Fig. 4b), and the small Tafel slope of as obtained H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x (68 mV/dec) suggests the increased surface proton concentration, indicating a fast acidic HER electro-catalysis process. The slopes of H2 reduced WO3− x and fresh Pd/WO3− x are relatively high, which are 151 and 133 mV/dec respectively. Extracting from the Nyquist plot, charge transfer resistance can be also used to evaluate the electrode kinetics. Fig. 4(c) exhibits the Nyquist plots of H2 reduced WO3− x , fresh Pd/WO3− x and H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x , in which the semicircles of all samples exhibit almost the same onset position, revealing their solution resistances (R s) values are nearly consistent. The semicircular diameter of H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x , is obviously the smallest among those of the referenced samples, highlighting that the sample possesses the smallest charge transfer resistance between electrolyte and the working electrode for water activation. Another significant concern for the effectiveness of the HER catalysts is their long-term stability. A prolonged chronopotentiometry measurement was conducted at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The inset in Fig. 4(c) shows that, the H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x has a negative shift of approximately 15 mV at 10 mA/cm2 after catalyzing hydrogen production for more than 20 h. In comparison, such a stable performance is significantly superior to that of commercial 20% Pd/C catalysts [45]. Whereas, the sample of Pd nanoparticles (the fresh Pd/WO3− x ) shows a poor catalytic stability and significant activity loss, evidencing that hydrogen atmosphere can enhance the interaction between Pd and WO3− x . To further reveal the inherent electro-catalytic activity of different catalysts, the electrochemically surface area (ECSA) measurements were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S7). ECSA can be determined from the double-layer capacitance (C dI), a larger C dI usually implies higher ECSA for electrocatalysis. Compared to H2 reduced WO3− x (3 mF/cm2) and fresh Pd/WO3− x (13 mF/cm2), an obvious increase in the C dI (175 mF/cm2) (Fig. 4d) was obtained for the H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample. The Pd single atoms supported on WO3− x demonstrate the higher TOF value than Pd nanoparticles (Fig. S8) [46]. In addition, Pd single atoms catalyst with the high Faradaic efficiency closes to 100% (Fig. S9). According to Table S1, the performance of Pd single atoms anchored on WO3− x in this work excels most HER Pd-based electrocatalysts in acids. All these results emphasized that the H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x possesses the outstanding catalytic ability for HER process. The discernible HER behaviors exhibited by the WO3− x supported electro-catalysts suggest variations in the adsorption and desorption capabilities of intermediates on the surfaces. Detecting the surface change of local electronic structure of Pd, W, and O species when increasing applied potentials is crucial to clarify the HER process. Hence, quasi in situ HER measurements monitored by the analysis chamber of XPS and glove box system were performed [47,48]. Fig. 5 (a) shows the Pd 3d core-level XPS data of H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x by increasing potentials (the initial state and −0.1 V). The H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample soaked in H2SO4 solutions for 400 s is selected as the initial sample. It is evident that for the initial sample, Pd 3d XPS exhibits both the metallic state Pd0 (335.5 eV for Pd 3d 5/2 and 340.7 eV for Pd 3d 3/2) and the oxidation state Pd δ + (337.3 eV for Pd 3d 5/2 and 342.5 eV for Pd 3d 3/2). Note that the presence of Pd δ + oxidation state originated from the inevitable oxidation of the as-obtained Pd0 single-atom catalyst, which is slightly different from the analysis of in situ temperature-dependent XPS measurement. However, we think the electron-rich reduction environment at cathode will in-situ clean the catalyst surface, thus providing low-valence and/or zero valence Pd0 atoms serving as the real active sites for HER process. With the increase of applied negative potentials to −0.1 V, both the Pd 3d and W 4f XPS results exhibit markedly enhancement of Pd0 and low-valence W5+. Interestingly, we also found that the content of Pd increased significantly after HER process, which may be due to the clean function of HER at cathode, because the proton-coupled electron reaction can in situ remove the impurities on the catalyst surface [49,50], thus making more Pd species being detected (Fig. 5a, Fig. S10a). As expected, the intensities of signals corresponding to W5+ increase when the negative potential applied to −0.1 V, resulting the 47% atomic percent value of W5+ (34.2 eV for W 4f 7/2 and 36.3 eV for W 4f 5/2) for W6+ (36.0 eV for W 4f 7/2 and 38.1 eV for W 4f 5/2) (Fig. 5b). However, we would like to point out a small detail that the initial W 4f XPS used in quasi in situ HER test was different from the desired one recorded at in situ NAP-XPS data (400 °C, 0.1 mbar H2), which can be attributed to the oxygen appealing behavior of unsaturated-coordination W atoms in low-valence WO3− x matrix under open air condition. From Fig. 5(c), the initial O 1s XPS data displays three peaks at 530.8, 532.5 and 534.6 eV, which can be attributed to oxygen lattice, hydroxyl and adsorbed water, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the O 1s peak shape of the initial sample here is basically similar to that of the O 1s data (400 °C, 0.1 mbar H2) (Fig. S5a), while when the negative potential applied to −0.1 V, the peak area of the O 1s at 532.5 eV increases compared to the initial state, indicating more metal-hydroxyl species are formed. This finding suggests that, due to the atomically dispersed Pd atoms and thus the strong interaction between Pd and WO3− x , hydrogen protons can be easily adsorbed on the surfaces and finally combined with O from the supported WO3− x , this is in good consistency with that the O lattice is consumed from the XPS results [40,51]. While the change of metal-hydroxyl species before and after HER electro-catalysis did not occur apparently on the sample of the fresh Pd/WO3− x (Fig. S10b). Therefore, the H2 activation under heating enhances the interaction between Pd and WO3− x , resulting in balanced zero valence Pd single atoms, which plays an important role in the acid HER process. The elemental distribution of the reacted H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample was further mapped by operating the TEM in scanning mode (STEM), shown in Fig. 5(d–f). It displays the homogeneous distribution of Pd without apparent aggregation after the LSV reaction. This implies that tungsten oxides can efficiently stabilize and capture the Pd0 single atoms. Aberration-corrected (AC) STEM characterization was performed to reveal the atomic morphology of the reacted H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x sample after the LSV reaction. As depicted in Fig. 5(g), a multitude of well-dispersed bright spots can be observed across the WO3− x support (as indicated by the red dashed circles). This occurrence could be attributed to the presence of trapped Pd at the O–Pd–W sites on the surface of WO3− x . 4 Conclusions In summary, Pd single atoms anchored on WO3− x support were achieved through thermal treatment of Pd nanoparticles with reducible atmosphere. The mechanism of hydrogen activation was investigated, and oxygen defects produced by hydrogen play a vital role in stabilizing the Pd on WO3− x surface, which eventually resulted in a zero valance state Pd single atoms. The Pd single atoms (H2 reduced Pd/WO3− x catalyst) exhibits a markedly superior HER activity in acid solutions (η 10 = 70 mV), which largely excels that of Pd nanoparticles (fresh Pd/WO3− x ) (η 10 = 220 mV). The subsequent comprehensive quasi in situ XPS measurements and AC-STEM characterization evidence that the electron gain and loss balanced Pd single atoms on WO3− x should be crucial for the high HER activity. The active structure could be assigned to the trapped Pd in the formation of O–Pd–W bond on the WO3− x surface by melting the Pd nanoparticles on the oxygen-vacancy-rich oxides. These findings may provide a valuable route for the design of highly-dispersed single atom catalysts under a reduction atmosphere and deepen our understandings of fundamental electrochemistry in HER process and beyond.

        "dc:description": "Surface-supported isolated atoms in single-atom catalysts (SACs) grant maximum utilization of metals in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report a feasible pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Pd single atoms by thermally melting Pd nanoparticles on an oxygen-vacancy-rich tungsten-oxide matrix at reduction atmosphere. Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to monitor the formation of zero-valence Pd single atoms and the increased metallic feature of WO3− x substrate. Accordingly, the as-obtained zero-valence Pd single-atom catalyst exhibits a markedly boosted HER activity with a low overpotential (η 10 = 70 mV) at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope (b = 68 mV/dec), nearly 150 mV and a 3.0-fold enhancement than those of Pd nanoparticles (η 10 = 220 mV, b = 133 mV/dec) under the same conditions. In addition, quasi in situ XPS results suggest the hydrogen spillover effect is more likely to occur on Pd single atoms during the electrochemical process. Our work may pave an interesting route for the rational design of highly-efficient single-atom catalysts, and the elucidation of corresponding enhanced reaction mechanisms by the utilization of advanced characterization techniques.",
