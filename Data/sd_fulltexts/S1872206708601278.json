The effect of calcination temperature and recycling of the catalyst were inves- tigated. The catalyst prepared at 400 or 500 o C showed the highest activity, with a DMC conversion of 73.9%, and the selectivity for DPC and MPC was 39.5% and 56.5%, respectively. The catalyst activity fell and the conversion of DMC was reduced from 73.9% to 10.2% after five recycles. X-ray diffraction showed that the catalyst had an orthorhombic structure and the (110) or/and (021) face(s) is/are the most active for the transesterification of DMC and PA. The used catalyst can be easily regenerated by calcination at 400 or 500 o C in air for 5 h, and the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalyst was almost as high as the fresh one. Key words: molybdenum trioxide; transesterification; dimethyl carbonate; phenyl acetate; diphenyl carbonate � Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is a potential substitute for the highly toxic phosgene in the synthesis of polycarbonates (PCs). Due to the rapid increase in market demand for PCs, the market demand for DPC has increased rapidly [1–3]. The traditional phosgene method for the production of DPC has safety prob- lems and causes environmental pollution, and is gradually being phased out. Several non-phosgene methods for the syn- thesis of DPC have been proposed [4–9], which include the oxidative carbonylation of phenol and the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with phenol, and the transesterifi- cation of DMC with phenyl acetated (PA). From thermody- namic and atom economy considerations, the transesterifica- tion of DMC with PA is a promising route for the production of DPC [10,11]. Currently, a variety of homogeneous catalyst systems such as titanium esters and conventional Lewis acids [12] have been developed for the transesterification. Unfortu- nately, these homogeneous catalysts are sensitive to air and moisture, which limits their use in commercial applications. Consequently, the development of a more efficient catalyst is desirable. Molybdenum trioxide has a ReO 3 -type structure with a linked MoO 6 octahedral geometry. The MoO 6 octahedrons can share the edges or vertices, and bond to form a three-dimen- sional network structure or a two-dimensional layered frame- work or a one-dimensional zigzag chain. The result is a layered compound with a special electronic structure that has wide uses [13–16]. In this work, we report a simple and effective tech- nique for the preparation of MoO 3 by direct calcination under ambient conditions, and its use as the transesterification cata- lyst of DMC and PA to DPC. MoO 3 was prepared by direct calcination of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo- O 7 ·4H 2 O in a muffle furnace at 400, 500, and 600 o C for 5 h. The catalysts were named MoO 3 -400, MoO 3 -500, and MoO 3 -600, respectively. The reaction was carried out in a 250 CAO Ping et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 853–855 ml high pressure autoclave equipped with temperature con- troller. PA, DMC, and the catalyst were introduced into the autoclave in stoichiometric proportions after leak testing of the autoclave using nitrogen. The reaction temperature was kept between 150 and 190 o C. The reaction mixture was stirred. After reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the product was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2010, Shimadzu) equipped with a capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25 m) and a flame ionization detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for MoO 3 were obtained using a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu anode ( = 0.154 056 nm). The catalytic activity of the MoO 3 catalysts is listed in Table 1. Pure MoO 3 prepared by calcination of (NH 4 ) 6 MoO 7 ·4H 2 O at 400 and 500 o C gave the higher catalytic activity, but pure MoO 3 prepared at 600 o C and the commercial sample gave low activity. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of different MoO 3 cata- lysts. These can be assigned to orthorhombic structured MoO 3 with the main diffraction angles of 12.72°, 23.30°, 25.66°, 27.28°, and 38.94° corresponding to the (020), (110), (040), (021), and (060) crystal faces, respectively (JCPDS 05-0508). The lattice parameters were a = 0.396 2 nm, b = 1.385 8 nm, c = 0.369 7 nm, . = = = 90°. As shown in Fig. 1, the diffrac- tion intensity of the samples changed with the calcination temperature. The main diffraction peaks of the samples cal- cined at 400 and 500 o C corresponded to the (110), (040), and (021) crystal faces, with the strongest diffraction peak due to the (021) face. However, the main diffraction peaks of the sample calcined at 600 o C corresponded to the (020), (040), and (021) crystal faces, with the strongest diffraction peak due to the (020) face. The main diffraction peaks of the commercial sample corresponded to the (020), (040), and (060) crystal faces, with the strongest diffraction peak due to the (060) face. The diffraction intensity of the (020), (040), and (060) faces increased with the calcination temperature, but the intensity of the (110) and (021) faces decreased with the calcination tem- perature with the decrease being more for the (021) face than the (110) face. It can be seen from Table 1 that the activity of the MoO 3 catalysts decreased drastically with the decrease of the intensity of (110) and (021), which illustrated that the main reason for the different activities may be related to the intensity of the MoO 3 crystal planes. Therefore, the (021) and (110) planes may be more active for the transesterification of DMC and PA to DPC, and the appropriate calcination temperature for MoO 3 is 400 o C. The catalytic activity of reused MoO 3 -400 is listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the catalytic activity of MoO 3 -400 drastically decreased after use five times, and it can be regen- erated by calcination at 400 or 500 o C to give an activity equal to the fresh catalyst. Therefore, MoO 3 can be used as a highly Table 1 Effect of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of MoO 3 Selectivity (%) Catalyst X(DMC)/% MPC DPC MPC + DPC PhOH MoO 3 -400 73.9 56.5 39.5 96.0 4.0 MoO 3 -500 73.5 56. 39.6 96.1 3.9 MoO 3 -600 20.0 62.0 33.5 95.5 4.5 Commercial MoO 3 16.8 63.0 32.8 95.8 4.2 Reaction conditions: n(PA) = 1.0 mol, n(cat)/n(PA) = 0.05, n(DMC)/n(PA) = 1/2, t = 7 h, = 180 o C.

The XRD patterns of the reused MoO 3 -400 catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, the crystal structure of the catalysts used four and five times and regenerated after being used five times at 400 or 500 o C was maintained, but the in- tensity of the peaks due to some planes of the catalyst that was reused five times, such as the (110) and (021) planes, decreased to some extent, which indicated that the main reason for the drastic decrease in catalytic activity may be related to the de- crease of (110) and (021) planes. In summary, MoO 3 , which can be easily prepared, reused many times, and simply regenerated, is an excellent catalyst for the transesterification of DMC and PA to DPC. It can possibly be used in industrial applications. References 1 Tundo P, Selva M. Acc Chem Res, 2002, 35: 706 2 Kim W B, Joshi U A, Lee J S.
