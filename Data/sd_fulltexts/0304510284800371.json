Box 77 (Hungary) Summary Hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of a large excess of ethyl- ene has been investigated on 0.04 wt.% Pd/Al 203 catalyst containing 0:100, 30:70, and 80:20 atoms Cu:atoms Pd, and on 5 wt.% Pd/SiO;. Reaction was carried out in a back-mixed flow reactor in the presence of both 0.4 vol.% and 18 vol.% hydrogen, using 0.4 -1% acetylene-in-ethylene mixtures. Ethane selectivity (moles C^B.^ produced per mole C2H2 converted) in- creased from 30% to far above 100% in the course of time, due to parallel ethylene hydrogenation. Concurrently, ethylene selectivity became negative. There was no change in and higher (C4+) hydrocarbon production. ^CsH; and 14C2H4 labelling showed that the intrinsic selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene is about 95 - 99% on all catalysts. Since ethylene is also hydrogenated at the same conditions, low overall selectivity results even when the Pd is fully covered by acetylene. Copper addition to palladium decreased the catalyst activity and in- creased its stability. This resulted in a significant decrease in the overall rate of CsHg formation, as well as a marginal decrease in C4+ selectivity. Introduction A double-labelling method (DLM) was used in previous work [1-4] to study the mechanism of selective hydrogenation of acetylene on Pd black and 0.04 wt.% Pd/Al 203 catalysts. Three routes are believed to be operative during the reaction: (1) dissociative adsorption of acetylene to form polymer species, as previously observed [3, 4, 7 - 9] characterized by C4+ formation: HC=CH + 'C=CH >'C=CHCH=CH * * * * 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 132 (2) reactive adsorption of acetylene with adsorbed hydrogen atoms to form ethylidyne species, which are responsible for direct ethane formation [2-4]: CHa C +3H' ^H3C-CH3 * * * (3) associative adsorption of acetylene from which ethylene is produced: HC=CH + 2H' > H2C=CH2 * * The ratio of the different routes is controlled by the reaction parameters. Investigators from other laboratories [5 - 9] have postulated that separate sites exist for ethylene and acetylene adsorption on supported Pd. Ethane is formed directly both from acetylene and from ethylene. This is shown by ^C labelling. When acetylene hydrogenation was carried out in labelled ethylene on Pd black catalysts [2], ethylene hydrogenation ceased above a certain acetylene pressure because the Pd black surface was monop- olized by acetylene. This paper reports our research carried out with two goals: (1) to in- vestigate the contradictions between the behavior of supported and unsup- ported catalysts, and (2) to add a second metal to influence the nature of supported Pd, in order to reduce those effects which result in low overall selectivity. Experimental Catalysts Four catalysts were used in these experiments. Catalyst A contained 0.04 wt.% Pd on y-AlzOa. The Pd on this catalyst was peripherally deposited onto Almasfuzoitoi Timfoldgyar 7-A1203 (90 m2 g~1, 3 - 5 mm spheres) from a solution of PdCl; in ethanol-acetone, and air dried. Catalysts B and C were prepared as A except that they were co-impregnated with 30 atoms Cu:70 atoms Pd, and with 80 atoms Cu:20 atoms Pd, respectively, from solutions of PdCIa and Cu(NC>3)2 in ethanol-acetone and air dried. Catalyst D was similar to A except it had 5 wt.% Pd on SiOz. All catalysts were calcined after impregnation at 875 K for 1 h, which resulted in catalysts with surface areas of ~40 m2 g~1. Reduction of the catalysts were carried out in flowing H^ at 548 K for 2 h subsequent to oxidation in 02 for 30 min at 470 K. Back-mixed flow and batch reactors were used for the experiments. Products were analyzed by radio-gas chromatography. The details have been given elsewhere [ 1 ]. 133 Two different reaction mixtures were used: (1) A simulated industrial 'front end' mixture containing 15 vol.% H2, 1.0 vol.% C2H2, 35.5 vol.% C2H4, balance He. (2) A simulated industrial 'tail end' fraction containing much less hydrogen (0.44% H;, 0.30 vol.% C^, balance ethylene). Results Ethylene selectivity was calculated both as moles ethylene produced per mole (ethylene plus ethane) produced: S,= Rc^ ^C,H.,+-Rc,H, and as moles ethylene produced per mole acetylene converted: o -\"C,H, Re H g, = 2 i = __ ^2\"4 RC,H,+RC,H, +-Rc,, -RC,H, Ethane and C4+ selectivities are based on acetylene disappearance: o - _ 2RC^ Q - _ Rc^ \"c,, - p ->C,H, - - ^C^H, -\"C,H, These selectivities were based upon GC product analysis, and are referred to as 'overall' selectivities. From ^CzH; and ^CzI^U labelled ex- periments, it was also possible to calculate 'intrinsic' selectivities of acetyl- ene hydrogenation only, designated as S;'. These intrinsic values include only products formed directly from acetylene. Typical experimental results for the front-end mixture (high H; concen- tration) are plotted in Fig. 1. Here ethylene selectivities, Si and 182, are plotted as a function of conversion for Catalyst B. The high negative values mean that ethylene, as well as acetylene, is hydrogenated to ethane. Figure 2 shows selectivity results plotted for Catalyst A obtained using the hydrogen-deficient tail-end mixture. Acetylene conversion and C4+ selectivity are relatively constant over a long period of time. 82 and S(^H,, de- crease and increase, respectively, eventually stabilizing. Experimental selectivity values in the (pseudo-steady state) stabilized regime are summarized in Table 1. The selectivities Si and S^ for ethylene are very low, sometimes negative. GC analysis shows that a large amount of ethane is formed. Both radioactive acetylene and radioactive ethylene were used to identify the ethane formed from acetylene. Typical plots for 14C2H4 experiments are presented in Fig. 3. The results are summarized in Table 1, where the overall and intrinsic selectivity values appear. These latter are designated S^'. No radioactivity was detected in C4+ products. 10 C,H, CONVERSION (X) Fig. 1.

Table 1 shows that regardless of the experimental techniques (using 14C2H4 in the batch system for front-end mixtures with catalysts A and B, or using ^CaH; in the flow system for tail-end mixtures with catalysts C, D and E), intrinsic selectivities remain the same, i.e., the fraction of ethane formed from acetylene is small. Most of the ethane is produced via parallel hydro- genation of ethylene. Experiments were normally conducted at pressures (determined by the conversion in a back-mixed flow reactor) which ensured the full coverage of metal sites by acetylene.

It was found in previous experiments [2] that when acetylene pressure was above 1 ton\", no ethylene was hydrogenated on Pd black catalysts. Identical results were observed for freshly-prepared supported Pd catalysts in the absence of acetylene pore diffusion limitations, as shown in curves II - IV of Fig. 4. In all cases, ethylene hydrogenation occurred only to the left of the observed maximum in the rate of acetylene hydrogenation. That is, 137 ethylene does not hydrogenate to any significant quantity above about 1 torr acetylene on Pd black and on freshly-oxidized and -reduced alumina- supported Pd catalysts. In these present experiments on supported Pd, the acetylene pressure was held above that value to ensure full coverage of metal sites by acetylene. Despite this full coverage, ethylene hydrogenation did occur, as shown by comparing S; and S;' values in Table 1. Thus, the expla- nation might be that ethylene hydrogenation occurred on the support and not on the metal. Experiments were made to establish what happened to the catalyst during aging. Figure 5 shows the weight increase us. time, as measured by a Sartorius microbalance during the reaction. On pure Al2C>3, after an initial period, the weight increase levelled off, whereas on catalyst A the weight of the sample continuously increased, due to polymer formation. Consequent- ly, the increasing ethylene hydrogenation activity of the catalyst is related to polymer accumulating on the support. We have previously shown [4] that overall ethylene selectivity decreases over catalysts that are only treated with hydrogen between reactions, in agreement with the observations of McGown et al. [5]. When samples are instead oxidized prior to reduction, no decrease in selectivity is observed. Thus, the decrease in overall ethylene selectivity is directly related to the buildup of high molecular weight oligomeric products on the catalyst surface (see Fig. 5), which may only be removed by thermal oxidation. CO addition normally improves selectivity, and is used in industrial practice. The effect of CO addition is shown in Table 2 for catalyst A, 0.04% Pd/Al203. At the addition of the first small dose of CO, immediate improve- ment in selectivity can be observed. By increasing the amount of CO, Si and Sc H approach the values that are characteristic of the intrinsic selectivity. This is also demonstrated in Table 1 (last two rows), for catalyst C, Pd- Cu/AlaOa. 20 30 40 TIME jhoursi Fig. 6.

Discussion The general feature of acetylene hydrogenation on supported Pd in the presence of large amounts of ethylene and in the absence of carbon mon- oxide, is the formation of large amounts of ethane. The non-selectivity can be slightly modified by the addition of a second metal (Cu) as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Isotope labelling has given evidence that under the con- ditions of our experiments, acetylene is hydrogenated mainly to ethylene and almost negligibly to ethane. Polymer formation is a result of dissociative adsorption of acetylene on the metallic site and is characterized by .1. for- mation. (No C4+ was formed from ethylene.) Due to the large difference in the strength of adsorption between acetylene and ethylene, pressures of acetylene were used which ensured full coverage of the Pd surface by acetylene. Below a certain acetylene pressure, formation of ethane drastically increases and the reaction becomes non- selective, as shown in Fig. 3a (t > 80 min). Above this pressure, on Pd black catalyst [2, 9] ethylene hydrogenation ceases completely. On aged sup- ported catalysts the proportion of ethane formed is still high, suggesting that at this pressure range a second site operates specifically for ethylene hydro- genation. The surface occupied by metal particles is small compared to the insulator surface, and this latter is monopolized by ethylene. Hydrogen is dissociated on metal particles, and probably can migrate through the surface polymer to the adsorbed ethylene to form ethane. This can be explained simply by assuming a hydrogen spillover effect that is well known, mainly for Pt and ?[12-19]. 139 In our case, the hydrogen spillover effect is not simple. First, if the catalyst is oxidized and reduced before reaction, this effect of spillover hydrogen cannot be observed. Second, Sc H gradually increases concomi- tant with the amount of polymer formed. This suggests that both the sup- port surface and the polymer together are responsible for the hydrogen migration. Boudart et al. [20] have shown that the presence of carbon con- taminants on a Pt-C surface increases the subsequent uptake of hydrogen by the catalyst, which they proposed was due to the contaminants acting as bridges permitting the surface diffusion, or spillover, of hydrogen atoms from Pt to the C support. We propose that a similar effect occurs here. Neither the conversion of acetylene (see Fig. 2) nor C4+ formation are in- fluenced by aging, as both of these reactions (as well as hydrogen dissocia- tion) proceed on the Pd site. Polymer formed migrates to the support and builds up a 'surface coating'. Infrared studies have shown that the intensity of the C-H stretching frequencies is very sensitive to the presence of hydrogen, indicating a reverse formation of C-H bonds without desorbing from the surface. It is conceiv- able that the hydrogen dissociated on Pd sites starts migrating via half- hydrogenation of the polymer. Figure 3 shows that all n-C4 species are ob- served in the products. The effect of the second metal is twofold: (1) Breakup of the Pd-H system which exists even on supported Pd [3]. Borodzinski et al. [21] have shown that the j3-phase Pd-hydride is both more active and less selective than the more common a-phase. In addition, they have shown that below a certain Pd particle size (~ 35 A) the (3-phase cannot form under acetylene hydrogenation conditions. This has also been demonstrated by Boudart and Hwang [22]. Lewis [23] has recently shown that the formation of the |3-phase in Pd-Cu alloys requires much greater hydrogen pressures than in pure Pd. For these reasons, if the (3-phase existed at all on the Cu free catalysts, which seems unlikely due to the very low metal loading, it certainly did not exist on the Cu-containing samples. (2) Insertion of Cu into the Pd matrix. The number of multiple Pd sites responsible for dissociative adsorption of acetylene decreases. As a result, the amount of polymer decreases, leading to a decrease in ethylene hydrogena- tion. This Cu insertion may also provide desorption sites for atomic hydro- gen; these sites would otherwise be active for ethylene hydrogenation. The CO effect is due to hydrogen displacement from the metal surface by CO, as previously observed [8]. Thus dissociated hydrogen depletion is responsible for the diminished rate of ethylene hydrogenation observed. Dis- sociative adsorption of acetylene also decreases when CO blocks the metal sites. As a result, the rate of polymer accumulation decreases, increasing the selectivity of the system to ethylene.

        "dc:description": "Hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of a large excess of ethylene has been investigated on 0.04 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst containing 0:100, 30:70, and 80:20 atoms Cu:atoms Pd, and on 5 wt.% Pd/SiO2. Reaction was carried out in a back-mixed flow reactor in the presence of both 0.4 vol.% and 18 vol.% hydrogen, using 0.4–1% acetylene-in-ethylene mixtures. Ethane selectivity (moles C2H6 produced per mole C2H2 converted) increased from 30% to far above 100% in the course of time, due to parallel ethylene hydrogenation. Concurrently, ethylene selectivity became negative. There was no change in C4 and higher (C4+) hydrocarbon production. 14C2H2 and 14C2H4 labelling showed that the intrinsic selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene is about 95 – 99% on all catalysts. Since ethylene is also hydrogenated at the same conditions, low overall selectivity results even when the Pd is fully covered by acetylene. Copper addition to palladium decreased the catalyst activity and increased its stability. This resulted in a significant decrease in the overall rate of C2H6 formation, as well as a marginal decrease in C4+ selectivity.",
