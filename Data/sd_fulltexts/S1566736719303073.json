Herein, an efficient aerobic oxidative synthesis of pyrimidines was carried out using cinnamyl alcohols and amidines catalyzed by manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2). The heterogeneous catalytic method features base-/additive-free conditions, wide substrate scope, use of O2 as a green oxidant, and simple operation. Moreover, the OMS-2 catalyst prepared by the conventional reflux method demonstrates catalytic selectivity, activity, and excellent recyclability. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Manganese oxide Heterogeneous catalyst Pyrimidine Selective oxidation N-heterocycles 1 Introduction Pyrimidines and their derivatives are valuable and important N-heterocyclic compounds because they are widely applied in agrochemicals, organic synthesis, natural products, functional materials, molecular devices, and coordination chemistry as electron-rich ligands [1–4]. Additionally, because of their biological and pharmacological activities, they frequently occur in pharmaceutical molecules including antitumor, antibacterial, and antifungal agents as well as anticonvulsants [5–7]. Therefore, the synthesis of functional pyrimidines has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Thus far, pyrimidines can be synthesized by reactions between amidines and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, triazines, alkynones, or ketones [8–11]. Multicomponent synthesis of pyrimidines from amidines and different alcohols using copper salts, Ir, or Mn PNP pincer complexes was also achieved [12–14]. Moreover, metal-free synthesis of pyrimidines between cinnamaldehydes and amidines was developed, although stoichiometric amounts of inorganic base were used [15]. Nevertheless, with regard to clean synthesis and green chemistry, the development of atom-economic synthesis of pyrimidines under base−/additive-free conditions using recyclable catalysts continues to be highly desired. As a metal oxide, manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) has recently drawn broad attention and been extensively studied. OMS-2, which is composed of the edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 units, has a 2 × 2 tunnel architecture with K+ ions inside the tunnel to balance the valence and maintain the structure [16–18]. Because of its redox, adsorption, and semiconductive properties, OMS-2 has been used as agents for catalysis, battery materials, ion exchange, and adsorption materials [19–24]. In addition, OMS-2 has a mixed-valence of Mn (majority of Mn4+; minority of Mn3+ and Mn2+) and shows an average oxidation state of 3.8 for manganese, which enables it to be an excellent heterogeneous redox catalyst in the synthesis of fine chemicals, removal of VOCs, degradation of pollutants in wastewater, electrocatalysis, and water oxidation [21–28]. In terms of OMS-2 preparation, in addition to the conventional reflux and hydrothermal methods, solvent-free, microwave, and sonochemical methods were developed [16,35]. Because of the different physicochemical properties of OMS-2 obtained by various methods, it shows selective catalytic activity toward certain oxidation reactions [18,21]. In recent years, our group has devoted to the preparation methods of manganese dioxide-based materials and their catalytic application in the clean synthesis of N-containing heterocycles [29–32]. In 2017, we reported copper oxide-modified OMS-2-catalyzed 1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine synthesis using alcohols and N-aryl amidines, and modification of OMS-2 with urea as an additive during the preparation was found to be efficient for the synthesis of quinazolines from the same substrates in the next year (Scheme 1 , a and b) [29,30]. Interestingly, when benzimidamides were used as substrates and allowed to react with alcohols, 1,3,5-triazines were obtained using OMS-2 synthesized with the use of H2O2-trapped reagent (designed as OMS-2-SH) during the preparation and OMS-2 prepared by the conventional reflux method (designed as K-OMS-2) did not show catalytic activity (Scheme 1, c) [31]. In the case of cinnamyl alcohol, (E)-2,4-diphenyl-6-styryl-1,3,5-triazine was isolated using OMS-2-SH as mentioned in our previous report. Unexpectedly, when K-OMS-2 was employed as the catalyst in the reaction of cinnamyl alcohol with amidine, a pyrimidine compound was detected as the sole product. The K-OMS-2 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidative cyclization reaction of cinnamyl alcohol with benzimidamide (Scheme 1, d). In this study, we describe that the conventional K-OMS-2 material was found to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of pyrimidines under base- and additive-free conditions. In the reaction of cinnamyl alcohols with amidines, K-OMS-2 showed highly catalytic activity, selectivity, and recyclability when O2 was used as the oxidant. A number of substrates could be tolerated in the catalytic system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation K-OMS-2 was synthesized by the conventional reflux method [17]. First, KMnO4 (5.89 g, 37 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water to prepare the KMnO4 solution, and MnSO4 was dissolved in deionized water to prepare the MnSO4 solution. Concentrated HNO3 (3 ml) was added dropwise to the MnSO4 (8.8 g, 52 mmol) solution, followed by dropwise addition of the KMnO4 solution at room temperature. Then, the mixture was stirred for 24 h at reflux temperature. The solid material was collected by filtration and washed with water. Finally, the solid material was dried at 120 °C for 12 h in air. OMS-2-SH, amorphous manganese oxide (AMO), and H-OMS-2 were synthesized following the corresponding procedures reported in the literature [31,33,34]. 2.2 General procedure for K-OMS-2-catalyzed pyrimidine synthesis All catalytic reactions were performed with oxygen balloons. Cinnamyl alcohol (0.6 mmol), amidine (0.4 mmol), and K-OMS-2 (13 mol%, 40 mg) were placed in a Schlenk flask with an O2 balloon. Air was removed, and PhMe (2 ml) was added into the tube using a syringe. If cinnamyl alcohol was used in the liquid form, then it was added after toluene using a syringe. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 18 h under O2 atmosphere. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled and separated by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain the pure product. 2.3 Recycling reaction of catalyst for synthesis of 3a Amidine 2a (20 mmol, 2.4 g) and K-OMS-2 (13 mol%, 2 g) were placed in a Schlenk flask with an O2 balloon. Air was removed, and PhMe (120 ml) was added into the flask using a syringe. Cinnamyl alcohol 1a (30 mmol, 4.02 g), was added after toluene using a syringe. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h under O2 atmosphere. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled and separated by filtration. The used catalyst was collected by filtration and washed with water, ethyl acetate, and pure ethanol. Then, it was dried in an air-drying oven at 120 °C for subsequent use. The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain the pure product. 3 Results and discussion The reaction between cinnamyl alcohol 1a and amidine 2a in toluene under oxygen was chosen as the model reaction to optimize the conditions (Table 1 ). When conventional K-OMS-2 was employed as the catalyst, the reaction between 1a and 2a proceeded smoothly and an 88% yield of pyrimidine 3a was observed without any by-products such as (E)-2,4-diphenyl-6-styryl-1,3,5-triazine (Table 1, entry 1). In our previous research, OMS-2-SH synthesized using an H2O2-trapped reagent provided (E)-2,4-diphenyl-6-styryl-1,3,5-triazine from the reaction of 1a with 2a [31]. As expected, OMS-2-SH did not show catalytic selectivity for the synthesis of pyrimidine, and a 90% yield of (E)-2,4-diphenyl-6-styryl-1,3,5-triazine was detected (Table 1, entry 2). One tends to believe that the smaller particle size, weaker crystalline, and higher content of Mn(IV) make K-OMS-2 to show exclusive catalytic selectivity when compared with OMS-2-SH (For characterization information of K-OMS-2, see SI). Next, the blank experiment indicated that the reaction did not occur without any catalysts (Table 1, entry 3). Precursors of OMS-2, such as KMnO4 and MnSO4, could not proceed the pyrimidine synthesis, although cinnamyl aldehyde was detected using KMnO4 (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). To further better the reaction, AMO and acid-modified OMS-2 (H-OMS-2) were tested, and moderate yields of pyrimidine were observed (Table 1, entries 6 and 7). Next, other green oxidants such as air and hydrogen peroxide provided a lower yield of 3a than that of oxygen (Table 1, entries 8 and 9). To make the reaction more environment friendly, a series of biomass-derived solvents were examined in the reaction. However, no satisfactory results were obtained (Table 1, entries 10–13). Moreover, the polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could also not proceed the reaction (Table 1, entry 14). Finally, experiments were attempted with lower amounts of the catalyst and reaction temperature, and a low yield of pyrimidine was obtained (Table 1, entries 15 and 16). Consequently, the optimized reaction conditions included use of K-OMS-2 as the catalyst in toluene at 110 °C for approximately 18 h. With the optimized conditions in hand, the substrate scope of the reaction was investigated with a broad range of cinnamyl alcohols and various amidines (Table 2 ). First, substituted cinnamyl alcohols were tested with benzimidamide 2a. All the oxidative cyclization reactions proceeded very well, and good-to-excellent yields of the corresponding pyrimidines were isolated, although 3-(furan-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol produced a slightly low yield of 3 h (Table 2, 3b-3 h). Subsequently, (E)-1,3-diphenylprop-2-en-1-ol and its derivatives that are the oxidative precursors of chalcones were employed as substrates to assess the tolerance of the catalytic system. The electronic effect of substrates did not influence the reaction, and 82–91% yields of the multi-substituted pyrimidines 3i-3n were collected (Table 2, 3i-3n). Then, (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol was used to examine the scope of amidines under the present catalytic conditions. A wide range of amidines including aromatic, heteroatom-containing, and aliphatic ones could be tolerated in the reaction, and good results were obtained (Table 2, 3i-3n). Moreover, 2-methyl-substituted (E)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-ol successfully participated in the reaction (Table 2, 3u). However, 1,1-dimethylguanidine could not proceed with the reaction and only the oxidative product of cinnamyl alcohol was observed. 3-Bromo-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol and NO2-substututed cinnamyl alcohol did not react with amidine 2a at all. Lastly, the leaching experiment was carefully carried out using cinnamyl alcohol 1a and amidine 2a as the model substrates. The reaction was stopped after stirring for 1 h, and a 45% yield of 3a was observed by H1 NMR. Then, K-OMS-2 was separated by filtration, and the filtrate without the catalyst was kept stirring for another 10 h. The yield of 3a did not increase further. The filtrate was also analyzed by ICP-MS, which shows that Mn and K were both below 10 μg/L. These results indicate that the metal species of K-OMS-2 did not leach into the reaction solution and the observed catalysis truly derived from the solid catalyst. K-OMS-2 was easily retrieved by filtration, then washed using ethanol and water, and dried at 120 °C for the next use. From the analysis of TEM and XRD, the retrieved catalyst very well maintained its morphology and the crystal phase of cryptomelane (JCPDS 29–1020) (Figs. 1 and 2 ). Importantly, K-OMS-2 also maintained its catalytic activity even in a gram-scale reaction (0.02 mol of amidine), and it could be reused for at least 5 times without obvious loss of activity (Fig. 3 ). On the basis of our experimental results and previous reports [11,31], it is believed that the synthesis of pyrimidine would begin from the K-OMS-2-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamyl aldehyde. Furthermore, benzimidamide reacts with the CC double bond of cinnamyl aldehyde to generate an imine intermediate through intermolecular Michael addition promoted by K-OMS-2 [34,35]. Then the intramolecular condensation occurs, followed by the oxidative aromatization catalyzed by K-OMS-2 to form the final desired pyrimidine product. 4 Conclusion In summary, we developed a heterogeneous synthesis of multi-substituted pyrimidines between cinnamyl alcohols and amidines through an aerobic oxidation reaction under base- and additive-free conditions. The catalyst K-OMS-2 obtained by the reflux method showed good catalytic selectivity and activity, which makes pyrimidines as the sole products without any triazines. The present catalytic system is simple to operate, can tolerate various substrates, and enables O2 to be an efficient green oxidant. Gram-scale synthesis of pyrimidines could also be achieved with a good yield using K-OMS-2. Moreover, K-OMS-2 has great structural stability and recyclability. The other application of OMS-2-based catalysts in the clean synthesis of functional molecules is ongoing in our laboratory.
