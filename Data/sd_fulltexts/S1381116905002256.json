The catalytic activity and recycling ability have been examined for direct esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols. It is indicated that the PPFSI was a strongly acidic polymer, which could be tolerant of high temperature, and an effective catalyst for direct condensation of carboxylic acids and alcohols. The new type of polystyrene with pendent perfluoroalkylsulfonylimide groups polymer (PPFSI or P-SO2NHSO2Rf, where P is the polymer chain, R = CF3, CF2CF2CF2CF3) was prepared by chemical modification of chlorosulfanated poly(styrene-co-divinybenzene) resins with perfluoroalkylsulfonylamides RfSO2NH2. Acid strength of the PPFSI was tested by the Hammett indicator method, acid contents of the PPFSI were determined by acid–base titration and the nature of chemical modification for the PPFSI was evaluated by IR, TGA and SEM. The results indicated that the PPFSI was a strongly acidic polymer, which could be tolerant of high temperature, and an effective catalyst for direct condensation of carboxylic acids and alcohols. Keywords Strongly acidic polymer Perfluoroalkylsulfonylamides RfSO2NH2 Catalyst Esterification 1 Introduction Conventional Lewis acid catalysts are now facing a challenge especially in relation to Today's environmental concerns [1,2]. A wide variety of novel Lewis acid catalysts such as metal triflate and triflimide have been developed and a series of reactions such as Friedel–Craftes acylation [3,4], Diels–Alder [5], and esterification [6,7] are effectively catalyzed by these catalysts. Although some of these catalysts are to be recovered and reused, the separation of the catalysts from the reaction system has to be accomplished by processes like distillation or extraction. For the ease of workup and separation, a lot of efforts have been done. Great progress has been made in solid acid catalysts such as clay, zeolite, sulfonated metal oxides, sulfonated polymer and polymer-supported catalysts [8–13]. Each of these solid acid catalysts offers unique properties that can influence the catalytic activity. However, these solid acid catalysts have also some disadvantages. Supported catalysts are in trouble with ‘leaching’ that leads to loss of activity [14]. Although zeolites catalysts have higher activity, reactions always give a variety of undesired by-product due to the higher temperature. Ion exchange resins are limited in application because they are thermally unstable above 120°C in the acid form [15]. Attractive alternatives to materials containing sulfonic acid groups are those containing sulfonimide groups. The high acid strength of sulfonimide has been well documented [16]. Recently, DesMarteau et al. have prepared perfluorinated polymeric membranes containing perfluoroalkylsulfonylimide groups as solid polymer electrolytes [17,18]. Feiring et al. reported the synthesis of a novel styrene monomer bearing a pendent perfluoroalkylsulfonylimide group and copolymers with a variety of olefinic monomers as potential electrolytes for lithium battery applications [19]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the polymer containing side perfluorosulfonylimide groups in catalysis domain. Recently, Yamamoto and co-workers reported a polystyrene-bound tetrafluorophenylbis(triflyl)methane as an organic-solvent-swellable and strong Brønsted acid catalyst and the high catalytic activity was achieved in a series of reactions [20]. In this paper, we report a new type of strongly acidic polymer. After polymer modification via fluorofunctionalization, the SO2 NHSO2 units are introduced and expected to show ‘super’ acidities due to the powerful electron-withdrawing effect of perfluoroalkylsulfonyl group (SO2CF3, SO2CF2CF2CF2CF3) whose anion is highly delocalized [21,22]. Moreover, fluorinated polymer potentially offers additional benefits of the enhancement thermal and chemical stability compared with the sulfonated polystyrene [23]. On the other hand, the highly hydrophobic nature of polymer catalysts was reported to play a very important role in activity for some reaction systems [24,25]. The esterification reaction was selected as the model reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity of the PPFSI. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and methods All solvents used for synthesis and esterification reaction were of analytical grade made in china and pretreated before use. D4020 and NKC-9 were purchased from Nankai Chemical Plant. Nafion NR50 was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Japan). All products were purified by column chromatography using ZCX-II (200–300mesh). IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vertex 70 Fourier Transform instrument (the variable temperature cell P/N 20610 solids Holder, 50–200°C). TG and SEM analyses were performed on Perkin-Elmer TG97 thermal analysis instrument (heating rate of 10°C/min) and on a Quanta 200 microscope (the samples were coated with gold powder on 682 Gatan Inc.), respectively. GC analysis was carried out using a FuLi 9790 chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. 2.2 Preparation of the PPFSI The synthesis route of the PPFSI is shown in Scheme 1 . 2.2.1 Preparation of polystyrylsulfonyl chloride To 1g of macroporous polystyrene beads crosslinked with 5% DVB (D4020, 1g, 9.52mequiv. of phenyl ring) was added to a 1,2-dichloroethane (35ml) solution of chlorosulfonic acid (11.11g, 95.2mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 80°C for 2h. The polymer was then filtered on a frit, washed successively with chloroform, THF, THF–Water (1:1), and THF. After drying in vacuo, the polymer was then treated with large amount of thionyl chloride and small amount of pyridine for 16h at reflux temperature in Ar atmosphere, immediately poured into ice-water when cooled to room temperature, washed with deionised water until the filtrate was neutral, and then dried in vacuo at 60°C for 24h, to give 2.71g of polystyrylsulfonyl chloride polymer (yield 81.1% relative to the aromatic rings in polystyrene; loading of SO2Cl=2.85mmol/g, SO2Cl groups content is determined by argentometry).IR (KBr, υ, cm−1): 3067, 2928 (CH); 1598, 1484, 1452 (C6H5); 1372, 1174 (SO2Cl). 2.2.2 Preparation of C4F9SO2NH2 CF3SO2NH2 and C4F9SO2NH2 were prepared according to the literature [22,26,27]. 2.2.3 Preparation of P-SO2NHSO2F9C4 Triethylamine (5ml, 0.033mol) was carefully added dropwise into the mixture of polystyrylsulfonyl chloride resin (5g, loading of SO2Cl=2.85mmol/g) and C4F9SO2NH2 (28.5mmol) in 50ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, heated at 60°C for 48h with stirring under an atmosphere of argon, filtered, washed successively with CHCl3, HCl, H2O, and dried in vacuo at 80°C for 24h. A 7.32g of polymer was obtained (yield was estimated to be 70.3% base on titration and reclaiming RfSO2NH2). IR (KBr, υ, cm−1): 3427, 1632 (N–H); 1601, 1479, 1452 (C6H5); 1367, 1172 (SO2 ); 1218 (CF). 2.3 Measurement of acid strength and contents for PPFSI The acid strength of the PPFSI was characterized by the Hammett indicator method [10]. The PPFSI was pretreated by being evacuated at 393K for 2h, then cooled to room temperature and allowed to contact the vapor of the Hammett indicator. The acid strength was determined by observing the color change of the indicator adsorbed on the surface of the PPFSI. The anthraquinone (H 0 =−8.2), p-nitrotoluene (H 0 =−11.35) and 4-chloronitrobenzene (H 0 =−12.70) were used as indicators and benzene was used as the solvent. Acid contents of the PPFSI were determined by acid–base titration. To a suspension of the PPFSI in H2O–EtOH (1:1) was added a standard NaOH solution. After the mixture was stirred for 2h, a 0.01% solution of phenolphthalein in EtOH was added to the suspension as an indicator. The solution was titrated with a standard HCl solution. The acid loading of the PPFSI was determined by several parallel experiments. 2.4 General procedure for esterification The PPFSI (0.1equiv. H+ relative to the carboxylic acid) was added to a mixture of carboxylic acid (5mmol) and alcohols (15mmol). The mixture was heated and stirred at given temperature for 6h. After the resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered and washed with ether. The organic layer was washed with saturated Na2CO3 solution, extracted with ether (3× 3ml), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The products were purified by silica-gel chromatographic separation. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography, and characterized by IR and 1H NMR. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Acidic contents and acidic strength of PPFSI The acid loading of P-SO2NHSO2CF3 and P-SO2NHSO2C4F9 was found to be 3.10 and 3.21mmol/g by several parallel experiments, respectively. The acid strength of solid acids can be measured by using an indicator method, IR spectroscopy of base molecules, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of base molecules, or microcalorimetry. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages [28]. The acid strength of PPFSI determined with the Hammett indicators is listed in Table 1 , which shows that P-SO2NHSO2C4F9 shows higher acid strength than P-SO2NHSO2CF3. 3.2 FT-IR analysis of the PPFSI A typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 1 . For comparison, the FT-IR spectra of chlorosulfonyl polymer (a) and the PPFSI (b) are shown in Fig. 1. The introduction of chlorosulfonyl group into the crosslinked polystyrene was not very easy because of resulting SO2Cl and SO3H groups at the same time with the chlorosulfonic acid as sulfonation agent [29]. Sulfonated polymer was treated with thionyl chloride to obtain a desired chlorosulfonyl polymer (a). It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1 that the characteristic absorption bands of SO2Cl group (ν as 1367cm−1; ν s 1172cm−1) in Fig. 1(a) almost disappeared in Fig. 1(b). Peaks at 1601cm−1, 1452 and 1413cm−1 can be assigned to the skeletal vibration bands of the benzene ring. Symmetric C–F stretching vibration at 1218cm−1 looked that very weak because of band overlap [30]. In Fig. 1, the characteristic absorption of N–H at 3424cm−1 was covered up by water peak from the samples or the KBr pellets, which was confirmed by the variable temperature cell P/N 20610 that can allow the study of band variation over a wide temperature range (see Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 demonstrates that, above the 120°C, and the water of the PPFSI and KBr pellet was eliminated and the PPFSI showed bands at 3427 and 1632cm−1 for ν (N–H) stretching and δ (N–H) bending vibrations, respectively, which was in accord with the literature [31,32]. Furthermore, no band at 3424cm−1 was observed for the chlorosulfonyl polymer above 120°C. The bands of the PPFSI at 1632 and 3424cm−1 above 170°C almost disappeared due to the decomposition of the perfluoroalkylsulfonylimide group. 3.3 TG analysis of PPFSI The thermal stability of the PPFSI was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the result is shown in Fig. 3 . No obvious weight loss was observed between 50 and 280°C for polystyrene (1). The thermogram of the PPFSI (3) showed no clear weight loss up to 170°C, and about 1% weight loss from 130 to 170°C which could be attributed to the loss of crystalline water or small organic molecules. The perfluoroalkylsulfonylimide group of the PPFSI began to decompose at 170°C, resulting in a 39.5% weight loss in the temperature region of 170–450°C. This result is consistent with the variable temperature FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. 2. At a heating rate of 10°C/min under nitrogen atmosphere, the weight loss was drastic above 250°C and completed at 550°C, which may be attributed to the decomposition of the polymer backbone. It is evident that compared with the sulfonated polymer (2), the PPFSI achieved a significant improvement in thermal stability. These results indicate that the PPFSI can be used safely below 170°C. 3.4 SEM characterization of polystyrene and PPFSI The SEM micrographs of polymers are shown in Fig. 4 . From the SEM micrographs (Fig. 4), magnified 5000 times, it was found that the pore size of the PPFSI (b) became smaller compared with the polystyrene (a) due to anchoring organic groups to the polymer beads surface. The SEM micrographs of polymer bead fragment (c) and (d) showed that with chemical modification the primary structure of polystyrene changed not only at polystyrene spheres surface but also in the polystyrene spheres interior [23]. 3.5 Catalytic activity of the PPFSI To assess the catalytic activities of the PPFSI, the direct esterifications of carboxylic acids and alcohols using the PPFSI as catalysts were investigated. The results are shown in Table 2 . As is apparent from Table 2, the PPFSI showed very good catalytic activity for primary alcohols (entries 1–4 and 8–10 in Table 2). But for a tertiary alcohol (entry 5 in Table 2) and a secondary alcohol (entry 7 in Table 2) the yield were not satisfactory under similar experimental conditions. More importantly, this novel fluorinated strongly acidic polymer could tolerate higher temperature than the sulfonated polymer and readily separated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration. In order to check whether the PPFSI could be reused at higher temperature the esterification reaction of phenylacetic acid and n-butyl alcohol was investigated and the results are list in Table 3 . Table 3 demonstrates that the PPFSI possesses excellent recycling stability and can be reused more than five times successively at 120–125°C without any loss of its activity. Table 4 lists the results of catalytic esterification of phenylacetic acid and butyl alcohol over different solid-state acids. It can be found that there is almost no difference in the catalytic activity between P-SO2NHSO2CF3 and P-SO2NHSO2C4F9, but the PPFSI has higher catalytic activity than the classical resins such as NKC-9 and Nafion NR50. The order of catalytic activities is: P-SO2NHSO2C4F9 ≥P-SO2NHSO2CF3 >NKC-9>Nafion NR50. Although Nafion NR50 has strong acidicity, the surface area of the resin in this form is very small (typically 0.02m2/g or less), and most of active sites are buried within the polymers. These sites are inaccessible or poorly accessible under typical reaction conditions, resulting in lower catalytic activities. The recent development of high surface area Nafion–Silica nanocomposites provides the opportunity to solve these issues [33]. 4 Conclusions In summary, a new type of fluorinated strongly acidic polymer has been prepared and characterized. Its catalytic activity and recycling ability have been investigated for direct esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols. The characterization and experimental results indicated that the PPFSI was a strongly acidic polymer, which could be tolerant of higher temperature, and an effective catalyst for direct condensation of carboxylic acids and alcohols.
