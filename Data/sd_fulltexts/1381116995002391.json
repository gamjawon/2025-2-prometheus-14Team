Keywords: Photocatalysis; Nitric oxide; Decomposition; Silver; Zeolite 1. Introductic-a Ion-exchanged copper/zeolite catalysts have attracted a great deal of attention as potential catalysts for the direct decomposition of NO into N2 and 02 [1]. We have reported that Cu2+ ions introduced into zeolites by an ion-exchange or doped in SiO2 using the sol-gel method are easily and selectively reduced to Cu+ ions on evacuation at temperatures higher than 573 K. UV irradiation of the thus formed Cu+/zeolites [2] or Cu+/SiO2 catalysts [3,4] in the presence of NO effects the photocatalytic decomposition of NO into N2 and 02 even at 275 K. Results of ESR, IR, and photoluminescence studies sug- gested that the excited state of the Cu+ ion produced by UV irradiation (3dl3d94sl) plays a significant role in the reaction. * Corresponding author. Ion-exchanged silver/zeolite catalysts have been reported to show very high activity for the disproportionation of ethylbenzene [5,6], photo- chemical/thermal cleavage of water to H2 and 02 [7], photo-oxygen production from water [8], photo-dimerization of alkanes [9], and the selec- tive reduction of NO by ethylene at around 823 K [10] or by ethanol at around 723 K [11]. The present work shows that Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst is of remarkably high photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of NO compared with photo- catalysts containing Cu+ ions reported in our recent papers [2-4]. 2. Experimental ZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2:Al203 mole ratio= 23.3:1.0) supplied by the TOSOH corporation was used. The Ag +/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was prepared by ion exchange with an aqueous 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI 138 l- 1169(95)00239- 1 400 M. Matsuoka et al./ Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 399-403 Ag(NH3)~\" solution. After the ion exchange, the sample was washed with distilled water and dried in air at 373 K. Silver loading was deter- mined as 6.9 wt% metal by an atomic absorp- tion spectrometer. Prior to spectroscopic and photocatalytic measurements samples were de- gassed at 298 K for 1 h, calcined at 673 K in the presence of 20 Torr of 02 for 1 h, then degassed at 473 K for 1 h. The AgZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by heating the Ag+/ZSM-5 in the presence of an H2/H20 mixture at a total pressure of 20 Torr (H2/H20 = 1). Photocatalytic reactions were carded out at 298 K using a high pressure mercury lamp and water filter. An UV-cut filter (A > 250 nm) was used to examine the effect of the irradiation wavelength upon the reaction. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. XANES spectra were obtained at the BL-10B facility of the Photon Factory at the National Laboratory for High-En- ergy Physics, Tsukuba. Si(311) channel-cut crystal was used to monochromatize the X-rays from the 2.5 GeV electron storage ring. The Ag K-edge absorption spectra were recorded in the transmission mode at 298 K. The ESR spectra were recorded at 77 K using a JES-RE2X spec- trometer operating in the X-band mode. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer at 77 K. DR spectra were recorded with a Shi- madzu UV-2200A spectrometer at 298 K. 3. Results and discussion UV irradiation of the Ag +/ZSM-5 catalyst in the presence of 10 Torr of NO at 298 K was found to lead to the formation of N2, N20 and NO2. The reaction profiles of the formation of N2 and N20 are shown in Fig. 1. Formation of N2 and N20 is found only under UV irradiation and the yield of these products increases with a good linearity against the irradiation time, sug- gesting that the reaction proceeds photocatalyti- cally.

The time profiles of the photocatalytic decomposition reaction of NO into N2 and N20 on the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst (a) and Cu+/ZSM-5 catalyst (b) at 298 K. alysts formation of a minor amount of N2 and N20 was observed, but it was small and negligi- ble compared to the yield of the reaction above UV irradiated Ag +/ZSM-5 catalysts. These re- suits clearly indicate that the Agions of the catalyst play a significant role in the photocat- alytic decomposition of NO. As also shown in Fig. 1, the rate of N2 formation on the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst is 10 times faster than on the Cu+/ZSM-5 catalyst [2], indicating that the photocatalytic decompo- sition of NO proceeds faster on the Agions than on the Cu + ions. As for reaction products, N2, N20, and NO2 were produced, suggesting that the decomposition of NO on the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst proceeds in a different way from the reaction of NO on the Cu +/ZSM- 5 catalyst to produce N2 and 02. (NO2 was also produced on the Cu+/ZSM-5 under the higher pressure of NO by the gas phase reaction of NO with 02.) Under UV-irradiation of the catalyst through the UV-25 filter (A > 250 nm), the photocatalytic decomposition of NO proceeded at 15% of the rate without the UV-cut filter, i.e., with the full arc of the high pressure mercury lamp. This indicates that the UV-light effective for NO decomposition lies in the wavelength regions of 200 nm to 250 nm. Fig. 2 shows the XANES spectra of the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst (a), Ag foil (b), and bulk Ag20 (c), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the M.

The XANES spectra of the AgZSM-5 catalyst (a), Ag foil (b), and Ag20 powder (c). XANES spectra of the Ag foil and bulk Ag20 exhibit several well-defined bands due to multi- ple scattering (A) at around 25530 eV and other bands arising from continuum resonances in- volving a multiple scattering effect in the region above 25550 eV, while the XANES spectrum of the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst scarcely exhibits any remarkable bands due to this effect. This im- plies that silver ions are anchored within the micropores of the ZSM-5 zeolite in a highly dispersed state forming neither clusters nor Ag metal or oxide crystals. Fig. 3(a), (b), (c) shows the diffuse re- flectance spectra of the Ag+/ZSM-5 (a), H+/ZSM-5 (b), and AgZSM-5 catalyst (c), respectively. The H+/ZSM-5 exhibits no in- tense absorption band in the 200-250 nm wave- length range. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits an intense absorption band at around 220 nm which is attributed to the 4d1 4d95sI electronic transition of the Agions [12-14]. The Ago atoms, and Ago and Ag~+ clusters are known to exhibit absorption bands at wavelength above 250 nm [15,16]. However, no absorption band of the Ag +/ZSM-5 appears in this region.

The DR spectra of the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst (a), H+/ZSM-5 (b), and AgZSM-5 catalyst (c). thermore, no EPR signals assigned to the Ago atoms or Ag2+ species were observed with the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst. These results firmly sup- port the conclusion that silver ions are included within the pore structure of the ZSM-5 zeolite as highly dispersed Agions. As shown in Fig. 3(c), after H2 treatment of the AgZSM-5 catalyst, the intensity of the absorption band of Ag ions at about 220 nm drastically decreases and broad absorption bands of Ago or Ag,~+ clusters appear above 250 nm, indicating that reduction and aggregation of the Agions has occurred. Since AgZSM-5 did not show any photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of NO, it is concluded that the Ago or Ag~clusters can not be associated with the reaction.

The hyperfme splitting of the signal shows that the electron spin interacts with a nucleus of Ag(I = 1/2) suggesting that the NO molecules are adsorbed on the Ag+ to form a nitrosylic adduct, i.e., (Ag-NO)[17]. The evacuation of the system led to the disappearance of the signal suggesting that the interaction of NO with the Ag+ ion is weak. On evacuation no new EPR signal ap- peared indicating that the oxidation of Ag to Ag2+ by the addition of NO at high pressures (> 1 Torr) did not occur. Fig. 5 shows the effect of UV irradiation upon the intensity of the ESR signal under the same condition shown in Fig. 4. UV irradiation of the AgZSM-5 catalyst having the (Ag- NO)species led to a decrease in the intensity of the ESR signal assigned to the (Ag-NO)+ species with UV irradiation time without the appearance of any new signal. After UV irradia- tion was stopped, the intensity of the signal returned to its original level. These reversible changes in the ESR signal assigned to the (Ag- NO)+ suggest not only that the (Ag-NO) species act as reaction precursors but also that the photo-induced decomposition of NO molecules proceeds catalytically. Fig. 6 shows the photoluminescence spec- trum (a) and its corresponding excitation spec- trum (b) of the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst. The exci- tation band at around 220 nm shows a good coincidence with absorption band which is at- tributed to the electronic transition 4d~ 4d95s~ of Agion on the AgZSM-5 catalyst. Therefore, the excitation band at around 220 nm and photoluminescence band at around 340 nm can be attributed to the presence of the Ag ion, i.e., to the excitation 4d1---> 4d95s1 and its reverse radiative deactivation 4d95s1 ---> 4d1 re- spectively. Fig. 6 also shows the effect of the addition of NO on the photoluminescence of the Ag +/ZSM-5 catalyst. The addition of NO onto the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst leads to the efficient quenching of the photoluminescence due to the Agion. As shown in Fig. 6(a), after the complete quenching the evacuation of the sys- tem leads to recovery of the photoluminescence to its original intensity. These results clearly suggest that the interaction of the NO molecule with the Agion is weak, and that added NO molecules easily interact with Agspecies in ground and also in excited states.

The most effective wavelengths of UV light for the photocatalytic decomposition of NO (200-250 nm) was found to lie in the same wavelength region as the absorption band and excitation band of the Ag+/ZSM-5 attributed to the presence of the Ag+ ions (220 nm). Ag +/ZSM-5 catalyst degassed at ambient tem- perature after UV-irradiation for a long period in the presence of I0 Torr of NO did not show any new absorption spectra which could have been attributed to the Ago atoms, Ago or Ag,~+ clusters as well as any EPR spectra due to the Ag2+ ions. These results clearly indicate that the decomposition of NO molecules proceeds photocatalytically on the Ag + ions. Furthermore, the EPR measurements indi- cated that the addition of 02 or NO at high pressures (> 1 Torr) did not lead to the oxida- tion of Ag+ to Ag2+ in the Ag+/ZSM-5 cata- lyst in clear contrast to the easy oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ in the Cu+/ZSM-5 catalyst [18]. Since Ag ions are chemically stable even in an oxidative atmosphere, the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst is a potential photocatalyst for the direct decom- position of NO at ambient temperatures. An- other advantage is that Ag+/ZSM-5 needs lower-temperature pretreatment (473 K) than Cu2+/ZSM-5 which requires evacuation at tem- peratures higher than 973 K in order to produce Cu+ ions as active species. From these various findings it was concluded that the photo-exited electronic state of highly dispersed Ag + ions (4d95s~) plays a significant role in the photocatalytic decomposition of NO while an electron transfer from the photo-ex- cited Ag+ into the 7r anti-bonding molecular orbital of NO leads to the weakening of the N-O bond and initiates the decomposition of the NO molecule. The remarkably high photo- catalytic reactivity of the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst can be attributed to the high chemical stability of the Agion and the efficient interaction of the excited electronic state of the Ag+ ion with NO molecules as compared with those proper- ties of the Cuion on the Cu+/ZSM-5 catalyst. The study of the excited electronic state of the Agion on the Ag+/ZSM-5 catalyst as well as a detailed study of the mechanisms behind the photocatalytic decomposition of NO will be the subject of our future work.
