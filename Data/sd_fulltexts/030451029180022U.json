Peter C. Vollhardt Department of Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley, and the Materials and Chemical Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 (U.S.A.) (Received August 21, 1990; accepted December 6, 1990) Abstract The phenylated diynes 3,3'-oxybis(1-phenyl-l-propyne) (3), its thio-analog 4, 1,2bis(phenylethynyl)benzene (5) and 1,8-bis(phenylethynyl)naphthalene (6) were reacted, under phase transfer conditions, in the presence of the ion pairs generated from Aliquat 336 and either aqueous RhC13 or H2PtClB. The nature of the products proved to depend on the catalyst employed. The rhodium catalyst promotes the conversion of 3 into a mixture of trimer 8 and dimer 7a, as well as the hydrolysis of the latter compound to give 1,3-dihydro-4,6,7-triphenyl-5-isobenzofuranmethanol (9). The sulfur compound 4 yields only hydrolysis-resistant 1,3-dihydro-5-[2-propynyl(thiomethyl)]benzo[c]thiophen (7b), and 6 forms mainly dieter 17 accompanied by small amounts of 7-phenyl- and 7chloro-12-phenylbenzo[k]fluoranthene (16a and 16b, respectively). The platinum catalyst promotes particularly intramolecular cycloaddition reactions of the diynes. Compound 3 is transformed almost entirely to 1,3-dihydro-9-phenylindeno[1,2-c]pyran (12), 5 is isomerized to give solely 5-phenylindeno[1,2-a]indene (15), and 6 yields 16a and 12phenylindeno[2,1-a]phenalene (18), as the minor and major products. Introduction Recently [ 1 ], we showed that the solvated ion pair [(C$H17)3NCH3] [RhCl4] generated from aqueous RhC13 and methyltrloctylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336.) [2] catalyzes, under phase transfer conditions, the cyclodimerization of internal phenyl-monoalkynes to give 2,3-disubstituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes. In this reaction of the original phenyl group is converted into a 1,2- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 296 phenylene moiety of the product by an ortho metallation process that takes place in a diphenylated metallacyclopentadiene intermediate [ 1 ]. We have now extended this study and report the application of the RhC13 Aliquat 336 catalyst (1), as well as an analogous HZPtCle-Aliquat 336 system (2) to the transformation of the phenylated diynes 3,3'-oxybis(1 phenyl-l-propyne), [(C6H,,C=CCH2)20] (3), 3,3'-thiobis(1-phenyl-l-propyne), [(C6H5C=CCHZ)ZS] (4), . 1,2-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene, [1,2-C6H4(C= CC6Hs)2] (6), and 1,8-bis(phenylethynyl)naphthalene, [1,8-C,oHs(C---CC6H6)2] (6) to give condensed polycyclic compounds. Experimental 3,3'-Oxybis(1-phenyl-l-propyne) (3) [3] and 3,3'-tMobis(1-phenyl-1-propyne) (4) [4] were prepared as described in the literature. 1,2-Bis(phenylethynyl)benzO (5) A mixture of 9.9 g (30 mmol) of 1,2-diiodobenzene, 6.6 g (65 mmol) of phenylacetylene, 420 mg (0.6 mmol) of (Ph3P)ZPdC12, 60 mg (0.15 mmol) of CU212 and 20 ml of either anhydrous piperidine or diethyl amine, was stirred under argon at 60 C for 6 h. The mixture was treated with excess 10% aqueous HCl solution, and the precipitate of amine hydrochloride was filtered off. The resulting oil was taken into ether, washed (2 x ) with water and dried over MgS04- Concentration of the etheral solution, followed by column chromatography on silica gel with hexane as eluent, afforded 7.5 g (90ss'o) of 6 (Rf=0.18) as a bright yellow oil that solidified on standing; m.p. 51.5 C (lit. [5] 52 C); 50 MHz '3C{'H} NMR (CDC13): 88.38, 93.69, 123.20, 125.75, 127.92, 128.29, 128.33, 131.55, 131.66 ppm. 1,8 Bis(phenylethynyl)naphthaO (6) By the same method 5.70 g (15 mmol) of 1,8-diiodonaphthalene. gave after 4 h at 60 C 3.36 g (64%) of 6 as colorless crystals; m.p. 109.1-109.9 C (lit [ 6 ] 105-106 C). General procedure for the transformation of the phenylated diynes Typically, a solution of 40 mg (0.15 mmol) of RhC13 - 3H20 (or 78 mg of HZPtCle - 6H20) in 2 ml deionized water was stirred for 15 min with 61 mg (0.15 mmol) Aliquat 336 in 1.5 ml (CHCIZ)2. The reaction vessel was placed in an oil bath at 120 C and 2 mmol of the appropriate diyne were added. The mixture was kept at reflux (internal temperature 104 C) under vigorous stirring for the desired length of time. After cooling, phase separation and workup of the organic layer, the residual material was separated by column chromatography and analyzed. Experiments in which a higher molar ratio of Aliquat 336:metal compound was used led in general to lower yields. 297 Reactions of 3,3'-oxybis(1 phenyl-1 propyne) (:3) in the presence of 1 Under the above conditions 1.00 g (4.07 mmol) of 3 gave after 30 h a mixture of 7a, 8, 9, 10 and 11a that were separated by chromatography on silica gel using mixtures of hexane and ether (5-3090) as eluent. 1,3-Dihydro-4,6,7-triphenyl-5-((2 propynyloxy)methyLJisooenzofuran (7'a) Yield 380 mg (3896); Rf (silica gel, ether:hexane 1:4) = 0.34; colorless crystals; m.p. 156.6-158.9 C (from ether); IR (CHC13): 2260 cm-' (C=C); 200 MHz 'H NMR (CDC13): 3.981 and 4.071 (two s, 4H, non-cyclic OCH2), 5.001 (br s, 4H, cyclic CH2), 7.002-7.507 (m, 20H, ArH); 50 MHz '3C {'H} NMR (CDC13): 58.19, 67.27, 74.25, 74.36, 84.99, 85.98, 122.77, 126.52, 126.58, 127.14, 127.51, 127.75, 128.03, 128.12, 128.18, 129.07, 129.28, 130.89, 131.64, 133.22, 135.01, 136.81, 137.81, 138.51, 138.81, 139.22, 142.64 ppm; MS (40 eV, 130 C): m/z (rel. intensity) 492 (M'*, 50), 462 (C35H260 +, 41), 375 (C28H230+, 60), 361 (C27H210+, 61), 331 (C261119+, 100), 264 (C21H12`+, 53), 246 (Cl8H140'+, 63).

A suitable crystal for X-ray diffraction measurements was obtained by slow crystallization (15 h) from a mixture of 1096 ether and 90ss'o hexane. Data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 automatic diffractometer. CuKa (.t =1.54178 A) radiation, with a graphite crystal monochromator in the incident beam and standard CAD-4 centering, indexing, and data collection programs were used. The unit cell dimensions were obtained by a leastsqua,res fit of 18 centered reflections in the. range of 25 5 0 <_ 29 . Intensity data were collected using the O-28 technique to a maximum 28 of 110 . The scan width, 08, for each reflection was 0.80 + 0.15 tan 9. An aperture with a. height of 4 mm and a variable width, calculated as (2.0 + j tan 8) mm, was located 173 mm from the crystal. Reflections were first measured with a scan of 4.12 min-'. The rate of the final scan was calculated from the preliminary scan results so that the ratio I/ay would be at least 40, and the maximum scan time would not exceed 60 s. If in a preliminary scan I/ar < 2, this measurement was used as the datum. Scan rates varied from 1.26 to 4.12 min-'. Of the 96 steps in the scan, the first and the last 16 steps were considered to be background. During data collection the intensities of 3 standard reflections were monitored after every X-ray exposure. No decay was observed. In addition, 3 orientation standards were checked after 100 reflections to check the effects of crystal movements. If the standard deviation of the h, k, and L values of any orientation reflection exceeded 0.06, a new orientation matrix was calculated on the basis of the recentering of the 18. reference reflections. Intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. All non-hydrogen atoms were found by using the results of the SHELXS-86 direct method analysis [ 7 j. After several cycles of refinements, done with the aid of a CYBER 855 computer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, using the SHELX 1977 structure determination package, the positions of the hydrogen atoms were calculated, and added with a constant 298 isotropic temperature factor of 0.08 A to the refinement process. Refinement proceeded to convergence by minimizing the function Yw([Foj - [Fc 1)2. A final difference Fourier synthesis map showed several peaks less than 0.4e A-3 scattered about the unit cell without a significant feature.

A suitable crystal for X-ray diffraction measurements was obtained by slow (12 h) crystallization from a mixture of 9096 hexane and 10% ether. The X-ray analysis was performed as described for 7a except that the unit cell dimensions were obtained by a least-squares fit of 24 centered reflections in the range 22 5 05 29 and reflections were first measured with a scan of 8.24 min-'; the scan rates varied from 1.27 to 8.24 min-'. The discrepancy indices are presented with other pertinent crystallographic data in Table 1. An ORTEP drawing of 9 is shown in Fig. 2. Selected positional parameters are listed in Table 4 and selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 5. Further data for the crystallographic parameters and calculated structure factors are available from the authors upon request. When the reaction was conducted for 50 h, the dimer 7a was entirely hydrolyzed to give 9 and polymeric material. 1,3 Dihydro-4 phenylnaphtho(2,3-cfuran (10) Yield 3 mg (396); Rf (silica gel, ether:hexane 1:4) = 0.29; colorless crystals m.p. 121.0-121.5 C (lit.

Data were measured on a PW1100/20 four-circle computer-controlled diffractometer. MoKa (a = 0.71069 A) radiation with a graphite crystal monochromator in the incident beam was used. The unit cell dimensions were obtained by a least-squares fit of 18 centered reflections in the range of 12 _:!~ B s 15 . Intensity data were collected using the co-2 9 technique to a maximum of 2 0 of 46 . The scan width, Aco, for each reflection was 1.0 + 0.35 tan Owith a scan speed of 3.0 min-'. Background measurements were made for a total of 20 s at both limits of each scan. Three standard reflections were monitored every 60 min. No systematic variations in intensities were found.

In fact, each of the substrates was found to undergo different transformations in the presence of the ion pair 1 and 2. 3,3'-Oxybis(1-phenyl-l-propyne) (3) was found to be initially converted by 5 mo19o of the RhC13 Aliquat 336 H20-(CHC12)2 system into a mixture of the simple dimer 7a and trimer 8 in ratio - 3:1. When the reaction advanced, however, the acetylenic ether 7a (but not the saturated ether 8) underwent hydrolysis to give carbinol 9 and PhC-=CCH20H (19). Compound 9 was shown by X-ray diffraction analysis to exist in the crystal as a hydrogen bridged dimer: the distance between the hydroxyl oxygen atom, O(9) in one molecule and the ring oxygen O(2) in the second molecule was found to be 2.72 7 t 0.003 A. The alkynol 19 proved to undergo under our Ph Ph Ph C \\ Ph Ph / \\ Ph X ~j ~ \\ i~ Ph 0 ~ I 0 0 / X, Ph P/ CH20H Ph Ph Ph Ph 78,X=0 8 7b,X=S 0 _ Ph 0 \\ I / X I P 0 Ph Ph 10 118, X . 0 12 15 11b,X-S X Ph \\ i / I Ph Ph \\ / / ` \\ a Ph / Ph P 168,X=H 17 18 16o,X=CI reaction conditions rapid polymerization rather than cyclo-oligomerization. Thus, after ca. 50 h, 7a disappeared completely from the reaction mixture and 9 was formed instead. When all the starting material, 3, had been consumed (ca. 30 h) the amount of 8 in the reaction mixture remained constant. Two minor side products (up to 3-4O) that were also isolated at 310 the advanced stage of the process were 3-benzoyl-4-benzyl-2,5-dihydrofuran (Ila) and the known 1,3-dihydro-4-phenylnaphto[2,3-c]furan (10) [8]. The accumulation of 10 results from slow thermal isomerization of the starting material [8] (and is formed even during distillation of 3), and its amount could be reduced by lowering the temperature of the catalytic process. The formation of 11a is explained by 1-promoted dihydration of 3 followed by an internal aldol condensation of the diketone intermediate RhCH2COCH20CH2CH2COPh (20). It is remarkable that no other adducts of water to 3 nor any further transformation products have been isolated from the reaction mixture. We recall that hydration of alkynes promoted by catalyst 1 has already been observed during transfer hydrogenation of phenylacetylene [11]. A full account on the hydration process will be reported in a separate paper. Although some analogs of 3 have been reported to undergo catalytic dimerization and trimerization by the (PPh3)3RhCl catalyst under homogeneous conditions [12], RhC13 proved to have no effect on the diynes in the absence of either water or the phase transfer catalysts. In contrast to 1-catalyzed dimerization of internal phenylalkynes [ 1 ], the transformation of the phenylated diyne 3 does not involve the alkyne-bound phenyl group in the formation of a 1,2-phenylene moiety of the product (except during the non-catalytic thermal isomerization of 3 to 10). Phenyl group involvement was, however, observed when 3 was treated, under phase transfer conditions, with 5 mol% of the H2FtC16-Aliquat 336 catalyst 2. In this case 3 was found to give (apart from 4% of the thermolysis product 10), 1,3-dihydro-9-phenylindeno[2,1-c]pyran (12), in which one of the phenyl groups of 3 formed the terminal phenylene moiety. The sulfur analog of 3, 3,3'-thiobis(1-phenyl-l-propyne) (4), reacted in the presence of the rhodium catalyst to give dimer 7b as the only isolable product. It should be noted that although the reaction of 4 was much slower than the reaction of the oxy-compound 3, the sulfur did not poison the catalyst as in the case of 3,3'-thiobis(1-propyne) and (Ph3P)3RhCl [12]. All attempts to detect the thio analogs of 8, 9, 10 and Ila in the reaction mixture of 4 and 1 gave negative results. 3-Benzoyl-4-benzyl-2,5-dihydrothiophene (llb) was, however, obtained when the platinum catalyst 2 was employed. In the latter system the activity of the metallic complex as a cycloaddition catalyst was, indeed, inhibited. No thio analog of 12 resulted in the reaction of 4 and 2. The only isolable products were the mono- and dichloro-compounds 13 and 14, formed formally by non-catalytic addition of one and two molecules of HCl to 4, respectively. The ratio of compounds 13:14, (which proved difficult to purify) depended on the reaction time. While 13 was found to be the main product in the initial stages of the process, the diadduct 14 prevailed when the reaction had advanced. In contrast to (PPh3)3RhC1 which was found to react with 1,2 bis(phenyiethynyl)benzene (6) to give a highly reactive metallacyclic 1:1 complex [13], our RhC13 Aliquat 336 catalyst (1) hardly affected this diyne at all. On the other hand HZPtCls - 6H20 transformed 5 catalytically solely 311 to 16, both under homogeneous (cf. [5, 14]) and under phase transfer conditions. When the reaction was conducted in a two-liquid phase system, the presence of the quaternary ammonium salt was essential. Aliquat 336free solutions of H2PtC18 and 6 in (CHC12)2 were found to be absolutely infertile in the presence of water. Unlike b, 1,8-bis(phenylethynyl)naphthalene (6) did react with 1, but in a different way than with (PPh3)3RhC1. Miller et al. reported the formation of a rhodacyclic complex from equimolar amounts of 6 and the Wilkinson catalyst that could be converted into 7-phenylbenzo[k]fluoranthene (16a) in a two step hydrogenation-dehydrogenation process [13]. In fact, the latter hydrocarbon had been reported earlier to be formed from metal-free 6 simply by heating [9, 10] owing to the close proxinuty of the two nearly parallel triple bonds [10]. By treatment of 6 with 5 mol% of the rhodium catalyst 1, the formation of this thermolysis product, (16a) was considerably suppressed, and the main product (42ssh) was the hexacyclic dieter 17. The isolation of 7-chloro-12-phenylbenzo[k]fluoranthene (16a) as a minor side product (l4ss6), indicates the intermediacy of complex 21. This complex may either react with a second molecule of 6 to give 17 [15], or undergo ortho metallation to form 22 (where at least one L ligand is Cl) in which a chlorine transfer analogous to that reported for phenylated monoalkynes takes place [ 1 ]. Hydrogen transfer in 22 would lead to the formation of 16a (in addition to the thermolytic process). Ph i i - _ Ph LO Rh-L - Rh-H Ph 21 22 By employing the H2PtC16 Aliquat 336 catalyst system (2) in the trans formation of 6, the accumulation of 16a was reduced even further (to 11%). The main product (73ssh) was 12-phenylindeno[2,1-a]phenalene (18), which had already been reported to be formed (probably via a series of vinyl cation intermediates [10]) by treatment of 6 with either AIC13 [9] or with some other platinum or mercury complexes [ 10, 16 ].

The phenylated diynes 3,3′-oxybis(1-phenyl-1-propyne) (3), its thio-analog 4, 1,2-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene (5) and 1,8-bis(phenylethynyl)naphthalene (6) were reacted, under phase transfer conditions, in the presence of the ion pairs generated from Aliquat® 336 and either aqueous RhCl3 or H2PtCl6. The nature of the products proved to depend on the catalyst employed. The rhodium catalyst promotes the conversion of 3 into a mixture of trimer 8 and dimer 7a, as well as the hydrolysis of the latter compound to give 1,3-dihydro-4,6,7-triphenyl-5-isobenzofuranmethanol (9). The sulfur compound 4 yields only hydrolysis-resistant 1,3-dihydro-5-[2-propynyl(thiomethyl)]benzo[c]thiophen (7b), and 6 forms mainly dimer 17 accompanied by small amounts of 7-phenyl- and 7-chloro-12-phenylbenzo[k]fluoranthene (16a and 16b, respectively). The platinum catalyst promotes particularly intramolecular cycloaddition reaction of the diynes. Compound 3 is transformed almost entirely to 1,3-dihydro-9-phenylindeno[1,2-c]pyran (12), 5 is isomerized to give solely 5-phenylindeno[1,2-a]indene (15), and 6 yields 16a and 12-phenylindino[2,1-a]phenalene (18), as the minor and major products.
