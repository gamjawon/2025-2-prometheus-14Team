Graphical abstract Filling the in situ-generated vacancies with metal cations captured by C−N bonds of defect-rich 3D carbon nanosheets produces a superior ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery. Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with vacancies/defects have been developed as highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts but with poor activity for OER, which limits their application in rechargeable metal-air batteries. Filling the vacancies/defects with heteroatoms is expected to be an effective strategy to obtain surprising catalytic activities and improve their stability especially under the strongly oxidizing conditions during the OER process. Herein, we successfully transformed the defect-rich 3D carbon nanosheets (DCN) into a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst (DCN-M) by utilizing the in-situ generated vacancies to capture metal cations via a modified salt-sealed strategy. By varying the metal (Fe, Ni) content, the captured metal cations in DCN-M existed in different chemical states, i.e., metal atoms were stabilized by C−N bonds at low metal contents, while at high metal contents, bimetal particles were covered by graphene layers, taking responsibility for catalyzing the ORR and OER, respectively. In addition, the in-situ formed graphene layers with an interconnected structure facilitate the electron transport during the reactions. The Janus-feature of DCN-M in structures ensures superior bifunctional activity and good stability towards ORR/OER for the rechargeable Zn-air battery. This work provides an effective strategy to design multifunctional electrocatalysts by heteroatom filling into vacancies of carbon materials. Keywords Carbon catalyst Vacancies/Defects Heteroatom filling Bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis Rechargeable Zn-air battery 1 Introduction Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the core electrode reactions in a rechargeable metal-air battery, which is recognized as a promising energy storage system with high safety, low cost, and high energy density [1–3]. However, due to the complex four-electrons reaction process involved, the wide potential range and the different rate-determining steps for ORR and OER, the desirable ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity and stability are yet challengeable [4,5]. Carbon-based material with non-metallic heteroatom doping (such as N, B, S, B−N) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates to replace the Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts, showing extensive application potential in the primary metal-air battery [1,6–8]. Benefiting from the high surface area and the regular pore structure, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used as ideal precursors to prepare heteroatom-doped carbon-based catalysts [9–11]. In addition, the vacancies/defects of electrocatalysts could significantly optimize the electrocatalytic activity [12–14]. The defect-rich 3D carbon with enriched active sites was prepared by high temperature pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8), which could alter the charge and spin distribution for the O2 adsorption to enhance the ORR activity and therefore the discharging performance of the primary Zn-air battery [15]. However, those defect-rich N-doped carbon catalysts showed poor activity for OER, which greatly limited their application in the rechargeable metal-air battery [16]. Meanwhile, the stability of vacancy/defect sites should be a major concern, especially under the highly-oxidizing conditions of the OER process. Previous work showed that filling the surface oxygen vacancies of Co3O4 with P atoms could endow this OER-only oxide catalyst additional HER activity to act as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting [17], which enlightened us to design a defect-rich carbon catalyst by filling the vacancies/defects with metal heteroatoms to obtain excellent activity and stability for both ORR and OER. In respect of the catalysis mechanism, the adsorption strength of intermediates on the surface of catalysts is crucial for catalytic activity. For metal–nitrogen–carbon (such as M−N−C, M = Ni, Fe, Co, and ZnCo, etc.) catalysts, the adsorption energy of the ORR intermediate species *OOH and *OH on surface could be modulated by optimizing the coordination environment to achieve superior ORR activity [18–21]. However, bimetallic particles (such as FeNi, CoNi or FeCo) are considered as the effective active sites for OER [4]. In addition, the stability of the transition metal nanoparticles could be improved if encapsulated in carbon materials (graphene layers or carbon nanotubes) [22–25]. Therefore, the controlled utilization of vacancies/defects of carbon materials by filling with different bimetal cations in synthesis is expected to develop a superior ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst with versatile structure. Herein, we successfully transformed defect-rich 3D carbon nanosheet (DCN) into an ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst (DCN-M) by filling metal cations into the in situ-generated vacancies/defects through a modified NaCl-sealed method, as displayed in Scheme 1 . In the absence of metals (Ni, Fe), the carbon nanosheets gradually formed were typically defect-rich. With the metal cations introduced, the vacancies/defects were gradually filled with the metal atoms, and an interconnected hybrid was in-situ formed to facilitate the electron transport. The Raman spectra and the XPS analysis were collaboratively used to confirm the decrease of the defect level and the increased metal–nitrogen bonds in DCN-M, indicating the efficient filling of metal cations. In addition, the metal nanoparticles coated by graphene layers embedded in defects gradually formed with the metal content increasing, showing highly efficient OER activity and stability. As a result, the Janus feature of DCN-M in structure endows the satisfied ORR/OER activity and stability for the rechargeable Zn-air battery. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of DCN-M series catalysts The series of DCN-M catalysts (DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M2) were prepared by a modified NaCl-sealed mechanochemical method [15]. Taking DCN-M1 as an example, in a typical synthesis, NaCl (4 g) was added into the agate grinding jar, and was ground for 30 min at 400 rpm. Zinc oxide (5 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.104 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.104 mmol), 2-methyl imidazole (10 mmol), and ethanol (1 mL) were mixed and then ground for 1 h, in which Zn2+ and Fe3+/Ni2+ coordinated with nitrogen in 2-methylimidazole to form the metal organic frames. The as-obtained precipitates were washed and centrifuged with ethanol for 3 times to remove extra 2-methyl imidazole and dried at 60 °C. The obtained precipitate (1 g) was placed in a quartz boat in a tube furnace, and heated to 650 °C (heating rate: 3 °C min−1) for 1 h under Ar atmosphere. Then the temperature was elevated to 900 °C (heating rate: 1 °C min−1) and kept for 3 h. Finally, the NaCl in the product was removed by being washed with deionized water for 5 times, and then the sample was dried at 60 °C to obtain a black powder, which is denoted as DCN-M1. DCN-M2 and DCN were prepared with the same conditions, except that DCN-M2 contained twice as much as the metal cations in DCN-M1, and DCN was prepared in the absence of Fe and Ni.. DCN-M was obtained by mixing DCN-M1 and DCN-M2 with a mass ratio of 1:1. 2.2 Fabrication of a rechargeable Zn-air battery The rechargeable Zn-air battery was assembled using a DCN-M based oxygen electrode and a Zn foil as anode. The electrolyte is 6 M KOH. To prepare the oxygen electrode, 30 mg of DCN-M was added into 6 mL of ethanol and 180 μL of Nafion solution (5%, DuPont) to form a slurry. After ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min, the slurry was sprayed on a 2 × 2 cm2 hydrophobic carbon paper. The catalyst loading is around 4.85 mg cm−2. A polished high purity (99.99%) zinc plate acted as the anode. 3 Results and discussion The surface morphologies, defects and compositional distribution of the as-prepared DCN, DCN-M1 and DCN-M2 catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figs. 1 (a–c) and S1 (Supporting Information), due to the confinement effect of NaCl together with the evaporation of Zn during the high temperature pyrolysis, DCN exhibits a typical 3D porous structure linked by the continuous carbon nanosheets with abundant surface defects and irregular nanosized holes. It is worth mentioning that the porous structure could provide various vacancies/defects, including doped defects, edge defects, and hole defects, all of which could benefit for the ORR performance. By introducing the metal cations (Fe and Ni) to partially replace Zn in the ZIFs, the spatial isolation Fe/Ni atoms at atomic level could be realized effectively. Fe/Ni atoms are geometrically separated on DCN by tuning the content of zinc dopants in precursors (Fe/Ni:Zn = 1:48 or 1:24). In DCN-M1, the graphene nanosheets (as further discussed below) with obvious in-situ growing wrinkles, as shown in Figs. 1(b) and S2, which could be also clearly observed in the TEM images (Fig. 1e and f). This interconnected structure combining porous carbon with graphene nanosheets is favorable for fast electron transport in electrocatalysis. As the atomic ratio of NiFe/Zn in the precursor increased from 1/48 to 1/24 in DCN-M2, the Ni and Fe are aggregated and piled up to form nanoparticles about 100 nm in diameter (Fig. 1g). However, most of the nanoparticles are about 2 nm in diameter (TEM images in Fig. 1h and i) and coated by carbon layers to protect the inside metal nanoparticles against being oxidized at the OER potentials. Compared with DCN, the large holes in the surface of DCN-M1 and DCN-M2 are almost disappeared. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding element mapping in DCN-M2 are shown in Fig. 1(j). It is observed that C (blue), N (cyan) elements are well dispersed. Fe(green) and Ni (red) aggregate obviously to form nanoparticles and overlap with the nitrogen atoms. Interestingly, the content of Fe is slightly higher than that of Ni, implying the capturing ability of the C−N bonds for different metal cations is different during the pyrolysis process. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured to study the porous properties. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2 (a), DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M2 exhibit typical type IV curves with hysteresis loops, demonstrating the presence of microporous and mesoporous structures. According to Kelvin equation, the H4 type hysteresis loop means that two-dimensional nanosheets are stacked to form the pore structure, which is consistent with the observed graphene structure in the TEM images. The gradual decrease in the hysteresis loop area of DCN-M1 and DCN-M2 is due to the disappearance of mesoporous and macropores, as evidenced by the pore size distribution (Fig. 2a). The BET surface area of DCN (953.7 m2 g−1) is higher than those of DCN-M1 (860.6 m2 g−1) and DCN-M2 (896.9 m2 g−1), but the pore volume (1.13, 1.19, and 1.13 cm3/g, respectively) is similar. The porous structure formed during the pyrolysis facilitates the mass transportation during the electrocatalytic reactions. Raman analysis (Fig. 2b) shows two prominent peaks at 1340 and 1590 cm−1, assigned to the D-band (defective sp3 carbon) and G-band (graphitic sp2 carbon), respectively. The intensity ratio of I D/I G reflects the defect level of carbon [15,26]. Compared to that of DCN, the defective sp3 peaks of both DCN-M1 and DCN-M2 apparently decreased and the graphitic sp2 carbon increased. DCN with more defects showed higher I D/I G ratio (1.204) than DCN-M1 (1.057) and DCN-M2 (1.024). Those results confirmed the reduction in defects due to the introduction of metal cations in carbon. Two broad peaks in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2c) at around 25° and 40° could be observed in both DCN and DCN-M1, assigned to graphite carbon. It also suggests that Zn in ZIFs almost completely evaporated during the carbonization, which was lower than 0.036% confirmed by inductive coupled plasma - optic emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis. The XRD pattern of DCN-M2 exhibit two sharp peaks near 43° and 51°, and a sharp peak around 25°, corresponding to the characteristic diffraction peaks of the FeNi alloy (PDF: 47-1417) and graphitized carbon (PDF: 26-1079), respectively. Metal atoms, such as Fe or Ni, could promote the formation of graphitic structure during the pyrolysis [27]. Since the ORR and OER mainly occurs on the surface of electrocatalysts, it is essential to investigate the surface chemical states of the metal cations filled into the defects/vacancies. The surface properties and chemical states of the electrocatalysts were further examined by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey XPS spectra of DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M2 (Fig. S3) show the presence of C, N, Ni, and Fe in samples. No Na+ or Cl− species were detectable, indicating NaCl was removed completely. The N content in DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M2 (Table S1) is 8.14%, 10.55%, and 7.14%, respectively, much higher than that in the carbon materials without NaCl (5.99%) [15], suggesting this NaCl-seated strategy could reserve more N species during the confinement pyrolysis process. Besides, the defective structures also facilitate the N doping at the defect sites. The high resolution C 1 s XPS spectra are given in Fig. 2(d), in which the peaks located at around 284.8 and 285.9 eV are assigned to sp2 and sp3 carbon, representing the hybridized graphite-like carbon and hybridized diamond-like carbon, respectively. It is noticed that no signal assigned to C–metal bonds is detectable for DCN-M1 and DCN-M2. To determine whether metals interact with nitrogen, the high resolution N 1 s XPS spectra are fitted to investigate the coordination of N (Fig. 2e). The N 1 s XPS spectrum for DCN can be deconvoluted into two major components: pyridinic–N (398.2 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.8 eV), respectively [24]. Interestingly, the N-metal-N bond (399.8 eV) could be obviously observed in the DCN-M1 and DCN-M2, which indicates that metal atoms had a strong interaction with the N species. It is therefore deduced that surface vacancies/defects were filled with metal cations captured by the C–N bonds, which could be also confirmed by the Ni 2p and Fe 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S4). Meanwhile, the binding energy of N 1 s at 401.6 eV is attributed to graphitic N, indicating that the graphitization of carbon can be catalyzed by the metal cations during pyrolysis, improving the electrical conductivity [28]. The synthesis mechanism was then deduced, as schemed in Fig. 2(f). During the pyrolysis of the precursors, NaCl was transformed into a molten state (801 °C) and functioned as a fully sealed nanoreactor because of its high viscosity, which could hinder the volatilization of nitrogen species and create a large number of pores [28]. Zn−N x would decompose starting from 650 °C, thus a large number of defects exposing nitrogen would be created as the Zn atoms were evaporated. Once the temperature reached up to 801 °C, NaCl salts was transformed into a molten state to fill the pores and enveloped the Fe/Ni−N x , which then transformed to the Fe−N and Ni−N active sites at 900 °C. The Fe and Ni were also beneficial for the graphitization of carbon. For DCN-M2 with a higher Fe/Ni content (FeNi/Zn = 1/24), the active nitrogen with lone pair of electrons would probably trap Fe and Ni atoms, i.e., Fe or Ni filling the Zn vacancies via bonding with nitrogen. Intensive Fe/Ni atoms around nitrogen were facile to aggregation at the defects and covered by the graphitized carbon formed during pyrolysis [27]. The 3D porous carbon-based catalyst with abundant defects filled with metal cations is expected to possess enriched active sites, and facile mass and electron transport as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. The OER and ORR electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M2 catalysts were measured by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) carried out on the rotating disk electrode (RDE) in the O2-saturated KOH electrolyte. As demonstrated in the previous literatures [2,29,30], the DCN catalyst is highly efficient for the ORR, but almost inert to the OER. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), when the atomic ratio of NiFe: Zn in precursor was 1: 48 and the Ni: Fe reached to 1:1 (Fig. S5), DCN-M1 with a large number of C−N−Fe/Ni sites presents the similarly high ORR activity to DCN. The DCN-M1 catalyst shows a higher limiting current density with an E onset above 0.950 V and E 1/2 of 0.864 V, which are close to those of the commercial Pt/C (E onset = 0.970 V and E 1/2 = 0.875 V, respectively) and superior to most of carbon-based materials [1]. With the atomic ratio of NiFe: Zn in precursor being increased to 1/24, DCN-M2 exhibited a very poor ORR activity and the ORR process became a two-electron dominated pathway judging from the limiting current (almost half of that for the other samples) due to the formation of nanoparticles (as evidenced by the TEM images). As a mixture of DCN-M1 and DCN-M2, the ORR activity of DCN-M slightly decreased. The Tafel plots derived from the ORR polarization curves in Fig. 3(a) are displayed in Fig. 3(b). The Tafel slopes of DCN, DCN-M1, and DCN-M are −130.53, −108.75, and −105.68 mV dec−1, respectively. For the Pt catalyst, the Tafel slope at relatively low overpotentials was close to −60 mV dec−1, indicating the first electron transfer is the rate determining step (rds); at relatively high overpotentials, the Tafel slope is close to −120 mV dec−1, suggesting a two-electron transfer reaction is the rds [31]. Herein, the Tafel slopes for the three DCN catalysts are close to −120 mV dec−1, indicating a two-electron transfer reaction is dominant, which is reasonable for carbon-based catalysts as elucidated in previous work [32]. The kinetic current density (J K) of DCN-M1 and DCN-M at 0.7 V is 42.85 and 46.84 mA cm−2, respectively, both of which are higher than that of DCN (31.46 mA cm−2), indicating optimistic ORR kinetics on the formers. The electron transfer number (n) of the ORR was determined according to the K-L equation based on the ORR ploarization curves at different rotation speeds (Figs. S12–S14). From the fitted K-L plots, the calculated electron transfer numbers for DCN, DCN-M1 and DCN-M are 3.54–3.61, 3.67–3.74 and 3.40–3.66, respectively, depending on the potentials. The n values of the ORR were also evaluated by quantifying the peroxide production yields on different catalysts by the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). As shown in Fig. 3(c), the peroxide production of the ORR was lower than 8%. Accordingly, the calculated electron transfer numbers are 3.9 on the DCN-M catalysts in Fig. 3(c). These results reveal a close four-electron pathway via an efficient oxygen reduction directly into water for the DCN-M catalyst. For the OER as shown in Fig. 3(d), DCN-M1 displays poor activity, while DCN-M2 displays a good OER activity with the low overpotential (η) of 350 mV@ 10 mA cm−1. It should be attributed to the in-situ generated NiFe nanoparticles, promoting the formation of Ni/Fe oxyhydroxides (NiOOH or FeOOH) as active sites for OER [33]. Taken together, the content of the metal atoms should be a key parameter to tailor both the ORR and OER active sites. Similarly, the OER activity of DCN-M also decreases slightly. Tafel slope was analyzed to understand the mechanism for the improved OER catalytic activity in DCN-M2. The corresponding Tafel slope of the DCN-M and DCN-M2 in Fig. 3(e) (derived from the polarization curves in Fig. 3d) is calculated to be 68.83 and 54.75 mV dec−1, respectively, which is lower than most of carbon-based catalysts [1], suggesting a fast OER kinetics over DCN-M2. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl) [34], as shown in Fig. S6. The C dl of DCN-M2 (21.32 mF cm−2) and DCN-M2 (23.08 mF cm−2) are slightly smaller than that of DCN (23.12 mF cm−2), implying the decreased defects/vacancies after filling the metal cations, which is consistent with the TEM, BET, XPS and Raman results. The OER current was normalized to the BET surface area and the ECSA (Figs. S6 and S7), respectively. After normalization, DCN-M2 and DCN-M still show much better OER activity than DCN. The analysis of the Tafel slope and R ct suggests that the improved OER reaction kinetics is caused by the enhanced charge transfer with the evolution of the NiFe nanoparticles. In addition, a negligible decay in the OER activity of the DCN-M2 was observed from the I-t curves after a 12 h stability test at the current density of 10 mV cm−2 (Fig. S8). Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DCN, DCN-M1, DCN-M2, and DCN-M were conducted to analyze the charge transfer resistance (R ct) during the oxygen electrocatalysis process. As shown in Fig. 3(f), the R ct of DCN-M (86 Ω), DCN-M1 (102 Ω) and DCN-M2 (100 Ω) decreased significantly as compared with that of DCN, which could be ascribed to the interconnected graphene nanosheets promoting the charge transfer process. The reversibility of the oxygen electrode with the bifunctional catalyst DCN-M can be evaluated by the potential difference between OER and ORR (ΔE = Ej =10 − E 1/2, where Ej =10 is the practical potential at the OER current density of 10 mA cm−2 and E 1/2 is the half-wave potential of the ORR) [35,36]. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the DCN-M catalyst exhibits a small ΔE value of 0.687 V in 1 M KOH solution, outperforming most of the reported oxygen bifunctional catalysts (Table S3). Meanwhile, in a 2500 cycling tests (50,000 s) of OER/ORR at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, the DCN-M electrode displays a satisfied stability almost without potential drop (Fig. 4b). Finally, a rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) was assembled using a DCN-M based oxygen electrode (Fig. 4c). The Zn-air battery exhibits an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.40 V, which is close to the theoretical value (1.65 V), indicating the excellent catalytic activity of DCN-M. With the DCN-M as the ORR catalyst, the ZAB discharges to a high current density of 204 mA cm−2 and a peak power density of 134 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4d). Such good performance can be attributed to its large specific surface area, the mesoporous/microstructure structure as well as the abundant active sites. Galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements (Fig. 4e) revealed that the DCN-M had potential platform at 1.370, 1.311, 1.271, and 1.236 V for discharge current densities of 2, 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−2. The rechargeable Zn-air battery using DCN-M as the oxygen electrode shows no obvious voltage change difference over 80 discharge/charge cycles (for ≈10 h; Fig. 4f). The 3D porous DCN-M catalyst is ideally suited for such rechargeable Zn-air batteries owing to the exceptional ORR and OER activities and durability by utilizing the strategy of defects/vacancies capturing metal cations. 4 Conclusions In summary, we successfully transformed the defect-rich 3D carbon nanosheet with only-ORR performance into an ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst by regulating the chemical states of metal cations (Ni/Fe) filled into the defects/vacancies. The characterization revealed that the C–N bonds in the edge of carbon played an important role to capture the metal cations into defects/ vacancies for the OER. With the introduction of metal cations, metal–N moities or FeNi nanoalloys formed, respectively, depending on the metal doses, and the graphene layers gradually in-situ growed to improve the electron transport. As a result, the DCN-M catalyst displays ultrahigh catalytic activities for both ORR and OER, with a small ΔE value of 0.687 V in 1 M KOH solution. Whether as the ORR catalyst or as the ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst, both the primary and the rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibit superior performance, with a peak power density of ≈134 mW cm−2 and good stability. This work provides an effective strategy to design multifunctional electrocatalysts by filling heteroatoms into vacancies of carbon materials.

        "dc:description": "Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with vacancies/defects have been developed as highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts but with poor activity for OER, which limits their application in rechargeable metal-air batteries. Filling the vacancies/defects with heteroatoms is expected to be an effective strategy to obtain surprising catalytic activities and improve their stability especially under the strongly oxidizing conditions during the OER process. Herein, we successfully transformed the defect-rich 3D carbon nanosheets (DCN) into a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst (DCN-M) by utilizing the in-situ generated vacancies to capture metal cations via a modified salt-sealed strategy. By varying the metal (Fe, Ni) content, the captured metal cations in DCN-M existed in different chemical states, i.e., metal atoms were stabilized by C−N bonds at low metal contents, while at high metal contents, bimetal particles were covered by graphene layers, taking responsibility for catalyzing the ORR and OER, respectively. In addition, the in-situ formed graphene layers with an interconnected structure facilitate the electron transport during the reactions. The Janus-feature of DCN-M in structures ensures superior bifunctional activity and good stability towards ORR/OER for the rechargeable Zn-air battery. This work provides an effective strategy to design multifunctional electrocatalysts by heteroatom filling into vacancies of carbon materials.",
