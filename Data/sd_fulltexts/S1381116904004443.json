Graphical Abstract We synthesized several VO2+ complexes of various ligands (en, TMED, bpy, phen, acac, salen, salophen) supported on acidic alumina. These solids were characterized by elemental analysis, IR and DRS spectroscopy and then used as catalysts in cyclohexene oxidation reaction by TBHP. The major products of the reaction were 2-cyclohexene-1-ol and 2-cyclohexene-1-one. [VO(bpy)2](SO4)-Al2O3 shows significantly higher catalytic activity than other alumina-supported complexes. Alumina-supported vanadyl catalysts with the nitrogen donor ligands show significantly higher catalytic activity than oxygen donor ligands at the same surface coverage.

The major products of the reaction were 2-cyclohexene-1-one. The influence of solvent and time for the oxidation reaction has been studied. The selectivity of the 2-cyclohexene-1-(tert-butylperoxy) varied with reaction time. Alumina-supported vanadyl catalysts with the nitrogen donor ligands show significantly higher catalytic activity than oxygen donor ligands at the same surface coverage. [VO(bpy)2](SO4)-Al2O3 shows significantly higher catalytic activity than other alumina supported vanandyl complexes. These catalysts can also be reused in the oxidation of cyclohexene for several times. Keywords Vanadyl Alumina-supported Oxidation of cyclohexene Heterogeneous catalyst TBHP 1 Introduction Heterogenized vanadium catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts, e.g., for the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [1–5]. Furthermore, supported vanadium catalysts are active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidative of butane to maleic anhydride, and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde or methyl formate [6,7]. In addition, vanadium catalysts are generally known as a poison for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts by destroying the Brönsted acid sites and the structure of the ultra stable zeolite Y (USY), [8–10]. A prerequisite for understanding the behavior of supported vanadium catalysts is a through knowledge of their surface chemistry and reactivity as a function of the type and composition of the supports and of the environmental conditions. Despite numerous-mostly qualitative-characterization studies, many fundamental questions concerning the oxidation states and coordination geometries of surface vanadia species still remain unanswered, and this has been the subject of a recent review [11]. In this study, we synthesized several VO2+ complexes of various ligands of ethylenediamine, tetramethylethylenediamine, bipyridine, 1,10-phenantroline, acetylacetonato, N,N′-ethylenebis (salicylideneiminato) and N,N′-phenylenebis(salicylideneiminato) supported on acidic alumina (Scheme 1 ). These solids were then used as catalysts in cyclohexene oxidation reaction by TBHP. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and physical measurements All the solvents were purchased from Merck (pro analysi) and were distilled and dried using molecular sieves (Linda 4Å). Vanadyl sulfate pentahydrate, VO(acac)2, ethylenediamine (en), tetramethylethylenediamine (TMED), bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenantroline (phen), 1,2-phenylenediamine, salicylaldehyde, and tert-butlhydroperoxide (solution 80% in di-tert-butylperoxide) were obtained from Merck Co. Cyclohexene was distilled under nitrogen and stored over molecular sieves (4Å). Cyclohexanone was used as an internal standard for the quantitative analysis of the product using gas chromatography. Reference samples of cyclohexene oxide, 2-cyclohexene-1-ol and 2-cyclohexene-1-one (Aldrich) were distilled and stored in the refrigerator. Acidic alumina was purchased from Merck (Art. No. 1078, aluminum oxide 90 active acidic, 0.063–0.200mm). It was activated at 500 °C for 8h before use. Elemental analyses were obtained from Carlo ERBA Model EA 1108 analyzer. The vanadium contents of the samples were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS-Perkin-Elmer 4100-1319) using a flame approach. The products were analyzed by GC-MS, using a Philips Pu 4400 Chromatograph (capillary column: DB5MS, 30m), Varian 3400 Chromatograph (15m capillary column of HP-5; FID) coupled with a QP Finnegan MAT INCOF 50, 70eV. DRS spectra were taken with a Varian Cary 5 UV–vis-NIR spectrometer at room temperature. 2.2 Preparation of heterogeneous catalysts 2.2.1 Preparation of VOSO4-Al2O3 (1-alum) Acidic alumina (6g) was added to a well-stirred solution of vanadyl sulfate pentahydrate (1g) in methanol (50ml). The mixture was then heated at 40 °C for 24h. The light blue solid was filtered and washed with methanol and dried at 50 °C under vacuum. The resulting light blue powder was stored in a lightly closed bottle and used without reactivation. The concentration of vanadium determined by AAS was 0.014mmolg−1. 2.2.2 Preparation of [VO(en)2](SO4)-Al2O3 (2-alum) Ethylenediamine (4.5mmol) was dissolved in 50ml of ethanol, and the solution was stirred. To this solution was added vanadyl sulfate pentahydrate (2.25mmol) dissolved in 25ml of ethanol. The color of the solution changed to green. The mixture was then heated at 40 °C for 4h. Upon cooling the solution, a green solid was obtained which was filtered, washed with chloroform, and dried in vacuum and purified by recrystallization from ethanol. Anal. Calcd for C4H16N4O5SV: V, 17.98; C, 16.96; H, 5.69; N, 19.78%. Found: V, 17.88; C, 16.82, H, 5.59; N, 19.83%. A solution of the [VO(en)2](SO4) in CH3OH was added to a suspension of Al2O3 in CH3OH. The resulting suspension was stirred at 40 °C for 8h. The green solid was filtered, and washed with CH3OH. The [VO(en)2](SO4)-Al2O3 catalyst was dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight prior to use. 2.2.3 Preparation of [VO(TMED)2](SO4)-Al2O3 (3-alum) This compound was prepared by a method similar to that for [VO(en)2]SO4] except that tetramethylethylenediamine was used instead of ethylenediamine.

The [VO(TMED)2](SO4) in CH3OH was added to a suspension of acidic alumina in CH3OH. The suspension was heated at 40 °C for 8h. The green solid was filtered, washed with methanol. The [VO(TMED)2](SO4)-Al2O3 catalyst was dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight prior to use. 2.2.4 Preparation of [VO(bpy)2](SO4)-Al2O3 (4-alum) and [VO(phen)2](SO4)-Al2O3 (5-alum) This compound was prepared by a method similar to that for [VO(en)2]SO4] except that bipyridine or phenantroline was used instead of ethylenediamine. Anal. Calcd for C20H16N4O5SV: V, 10.72; C, 50.53; H, 3.39; N, 11.79%. Found: V, 10.68; C, 50.42, H, 3.34; N, 11.82%. Anal. Calcd for C24H16N4O5SV: V, 9.73; C, 55.07; H, 3.08; N, 10.70%. Found: V, 9.67; C, 54.12, H, 2.98; N, 10.81%. Acidic alumina was stirred with [VO(bpy)2](SO4) or [VO(phen)2](SO4)-Al2O3 in CH3OH and after 40 °C for 8h, the solid color changed to light green. It was then washed with CH3OH and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. 2.2.5 Preparation of [VO(acac)2]-Al2O3 (6-alum) Acidic alumina was added to a well stirred solution of [VO(acac)2] (from Merck) in methanol. The mixture was then heated at 40 °C for 8h. The light green solid was filtered, washed with methanol and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight prior to use. 2.2.6 Preparation of [VO(salen)]-Al2O3 (7-alum) and [VO(salophen)]-Al2O3 (8-alum) The Schiff-base was obtained by condensation of the appropriate diamine and salicylaldehyde [12–16]. Ligands were recrystallized from ethanol at least once before metalation. The vanadyl Schiff-base complexes were prepared under ambient condition. To a hot solution of Schiff-base ligand (2mmol) in a mixed solvents (chloroform 15ml/ethanol 15ml), a hot solution of VO(acac)2 (2mmol) in methanol (15ml) was added. The mixture was heated and a few drops of triethylamine were added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 30min. The colored solution concentrated and cooled to yield crystals. Analytical data and physical properties for vanadyl complexes are similar to their complexes were prepared by literature methods [17–19]. Acidic alumina was stirred with [VO(salen)] or [VO(salophen)] in CH3Cl and after 40 °C for 8h, the solid colour changed to light green. It was then washed with CH3Cl and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. 2.2.7 Oxidation of cyclohexene; general procedure A mixture of 1.0g catalyst, 25ml solvent and 10mmol cyclohexene was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere in a 50ml round bottom flask equipped with a condenser and a dropping funnel at room temperature for 30min. Then 16mmol of TBHP (solution 80% in di-tert-butylperoxide) was added. The resulting mixture was then refluxed for 8h under N2 atmosphere. After filtration and washing with solvent, the filtrate was concentrated and then subjected to GC analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis of neat complexes Elemental analyses indicate that all of the vanadyl complexes are monomeric species formed by coordination of 1mol of the vanadyl ion (VO2+) and 2mol of bidentate diamine (en, TMED, bpy, phen) or 1mol of tetradentate Schiff-base (salen, slaophen) ligands. The vanadyl Schiff-base complexes are insoluble in water but soluble in most organic solvents. Infrared and UV–vis spectral analyses indicate that coordination of diamine groups on the vanadyl produce a less electrophilic metal-oxo center (Table 1 ). Green vanadyl complexes have VO stretching frequencies in the range 976–993cm−1, which are characteristic of monomeric five coordinate structures [20]. 3.2 Heterogenisation of complexes The heterogenisation of homogenous catalysts is a field of continuing interest. Although some of homogeneous transition metal complexes exhibit remarkable catalytic properties (activities and selectivity), they are unsuitable to separate intact, from the reaction medium making their reuse difficult and contaminating the reaction products. Thus, the heterogenisation is always a toxicological and environmental challenge; moreover, it has an economical significance unless the activities of the homogeneous catalysts are exceptionally high. We have done the heterogenisation by supporting the catalysts on acidic alumina. Acidic alumina was chosen because neither of neutral nor basic alumina did adsorb the complex on its surface. The adsorbing tendency of the acidic alumina might arise from the presence of oxygen groups on the surfaces, which are able coordinate to the metal ion center (Scheme 1). This hypothesis was further confirmed when we observed that the complex with three bidentate ligands cannot be adsorbed on the acidic alumina surface [21c]. Vanadium contents of the alumina-supported catalysts were estimated by dissolving the known amount of the catalyst in concentrated HCl and from these solutions, vanadium contents were estimated by atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS). The concentration of vanadium was 0.014molg−1. The IR bands of all catalysts are weak due to their low concentration of the complex on alumina. The IR spectra of supported complexes are essentially similar to that of the neat complexes (Table 1). The adsorbing tendency of the acidic alumina might arise from the presence of oxygen groups on the surface in order to coordinate to the metal ion center (Scheme 1). The DRS spectra of alumina-supported vanadyl complexes are characterized by ligand field transitions, and their energies are dependent on the coordination environment. In the d↔d region the alumina-supported vanadyl catalysts are characterized by a week absorption band and a shoulder (Table 1). Both transitions are typical for V4+ in pseudooctahedral coordination. The DRS spectra for alumina-supported vanadyl complexes are quite similar to the reported for several reference compounds of V4+ [13–16]. The observation of pseudooctahedrally coordinated V4+ by DRS, point toward the presence of a distorted octahedral structure with one coordination vacancy along the other axial position. The latter vacancy is most probably filled by additional lattice oxygen, which completes the coordination sphere. A pictorial representation is given in Scheme 1. 3.3 Catalytic activity We have recently reported the activation of CH bond with TBHP and H2O2 in the presence of exchanged zeolite NaY with transition metal elements, alumina-supported and zeolite-encapsulation of metal complexes [21]. We showed that some complexes of Mn (II) included in zeolite Y, catalyzed the oxygen transfer from TBHP to cyclohexene and concluded that such simple systems mimic the behavior of cytochrome P-450 type oxidation systems [21b]. We also showed the [Mn(haacac)]-Al2O3; (haacac = bis(2-hydroxyanil)acetylacetone], catalyzed cyclohexene oxidation with the highest reactivity and selectivity and 2-cyclohexene-1-one was formed as the main product [21d], and we showed a simple catalyst system of alumina supported Mn (II) complexes with a number of bidentate ligands of N, N; N, O and O, O donors atoms in the oxidation of cyclohexene [21c]. Since, alumina-supported metal systems exhibit catalytic activity in a wide ranging of the industrially important processes and have been extensively studied, we decided to investigate the effect of vanadyl complexes with different chelates of N, N; N, O and O, O donor atoms, supported on acidic alumina in the oxidation of cyclohexene with TBHP. Results of Table 2 show the catalytic activity of homogeneous catalysts. Comparing between neat and alumina supported complexes as catalyst evidence that alumina-supported catalysts gave higher conversion of cyclohexene than their corresponding neat complexes. The higher activity of supported complexes is because of site isolation of the complexes. The selectivity and activity results of these alumina-supported catalysts on the oxidation of cyclohexene with TBHP are given in Tables 3–6 . At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by filtration, thoroughly washed with solvent and reused under similar conditions. Although the analysis of the recovered catalysts by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy showed no reduction in the amount of vanadium ion, they showed a slightly lower catalytic activity (3%) (Table 3). The effect of VO2+ complexes supported on alumina was studied on the oxidation of cyclohexene with TBHP in CH2Cl2 and the results are shown in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 1 , only allylic oxidation has occurred with the formation of 2-cyclohexene-1-o1, 2-cyclohexene-1-one and 1-(tert-butylperoxy)-2-cyclohexene. Oxidation with the same oxidant in the presence of VO(SO4)-Al2O3 was 26.5% (Table 3). The increase of conversion from 26.5 to 94.1% compared to VOSO4-Al2O3 with [VO(bpy)2](SO4)-Al2O3 indicates that the existence of ligand has increased the activity of the catalyst by a factor 3.55. From the results indicated in Table 3, it is evident that cyclohexene-2-one is selectivity formed in the presence of all catalysts. The trend observed in Tables 2–6 could be explained by the donor ability of ligands (en, TMED, bpy, phen, salen, salophen) available in the complex catalyst. As Wang et al. have pointed out recently, the key point in the conversion of cyclohexen to the products is the reduction of L-M n + to L-M( n −1)+. This reduction to L-M( n −1)+ is facilitated with the ligands available around the metal cation [22]. The formation of the allylic oxidation products, 2-cyclohexene-1-one and 2-cyclohexene-1-o1 shows the preferential attack of the activated C-H bond over the CC bond. The formation of 1-(tert-butylperoxy)-2-cyclohexene shows the presence of radical reactions [23]. That TBHP as oxidant promotes the allylic oxidation pathway and epoxidation is minimized, especially under the highly acidic properties of alumina-supported with transition metal ions and complexes, has been observed by us and others [21c,24] (Fig. 2 ). Table 7 gives the effect of time on product distribution. By increasing time, while conversion percentage and 2-cyclohexene-1-one, the yield of 2-cyclohexene-1-o1 and 1-(tert-butylperoxy)-2-cyclohexene decreases at the presence of [VO(bpy)2](SO4)-Al2O3/CH3CN. 3.4 Effect of solvent The effect of various solvents for the oxidation of cyclohxene with alumina-supported vanadyl complexes as catalyst was also studied. The oxidation reactions were carried out in protic and aprotic solvents. The results are given in Tables 3–6. In all the oxidation reaction, 2-cyclohexene-1-one was formed as the major product. The selectivity for 2-cyclohexene-1-one formation was 82% while the selectivity for 2-cyclohexene-1-o1 and 1-(tert-butylperoxy)-2-cyclohexene was less than 18% for [VO(bpy)2]SO4-Al2O3 catalyst in CH2Cl2 (Table 3). When the reaction was carried out in acetonitrite as solvent, the conversion percentages decrease by a factor of 1.36 (Table 5). This might be attributed to the donor number of acentonitrile (14.1) and therefore, its higher ability to occupy the vacant spaces around the vanadium center and prevent the approaching of oxidant molecules toward the catalyst center. In dichloromethane and chloroform, the yields of 2-cyclohexene-1-o1 and 2-cyclohexene-1-one were higher and lower yield of the peroxy species was obtained as compared to the other solvents. 4 Conclusion In this study, we have used a simple catalysis system of alumina-supported vanandyl complexes with a number of bidentate (N, N; O, O) and tetradentate Schiff-base (NNOO) ligands in the oxidation of cyclohexene. Oxidation of allylic site was resulted with TBHP as oxidant. The high percentage yield of reactions especially in the presence of alumina-supported vanandyl bipyridine complex seems promising. The extension of the method to different olefines is currently under investigation in our laboratory. References [1] M.S. Wainwright N.R. Foster Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng. 19 1979 211 [2] V. Nikolov D.
