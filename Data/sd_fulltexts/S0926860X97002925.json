Introduction The products of ethylene oligomerization are linear ~-olefins, which are key intermediates for detergents, plasticizers, and a variety of fine chemicals. The demand for lower -olefins (C4-C8) is increasing, therefore linear low density polyethylene has been developed quickly [ 1 ]. Nickel chelate catalyst shows a high activity and selectivity to linear ~,-olefins in the oligomerization of ethylene, especially chelates with P O ligand [2]. The Shell SHOP process which utilizes the nickel chelate catalyst has succeeded in producing linear ~-olefins. In the patent [3], the catalyst was prepared by the reduction route and the sodium borohydride, NaBH4, was used as a reducing agent. Many papers on this mechanism have appeared [4-7]. Metal hydride corn- *Corresp~mding author. plexes have been proposed as the catalytically active species. In the course of researching for a process of produ- cing lower ~-olefins (C4-Cs) with the P O nickel complex catalysts, it was found that zinc or cadmium powder can activate the catalyst, especially, using zinc powder as a reducing regent can highly increase the catalytic activity and the selectivity to lower olefins. In this paper, we report the characteristics of this catalyst system. 2. Experimental Sodium salt of diphenylphosphinoacetic acid. DPA(Na), was obtained from the neutralization of diphenylphosphinoacetic acid and sodium hydroxide in ethanol solution. Diphenylphosphinoacetic acid was synthesized according to the literature [8 ]. Oligo- merization reactions were performed on a 2(X)ml t)926-860XI98/$19.0~) .~. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00292-5 L256 D.-h. Liu.

Each component of the catalyst (ligand, NiCI2-6H20, zinc powder) was added in a solid powder state. Then the solvent was introduced into the autoclave. The auto- clave was evacuated and swept by ethylene gas. At last the pressure of ethylene was maintained at 3.0 MPa and the mixture in the autoclave was stirred at 25:C for 1 h. Then the autoclave was heated to the reaction temperature and the pressure was kept at 5.5--6.0 MPa. After the reaction was over, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature by using ice. The products of gas and liquid were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-9A). 1HNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian FT-80A. 3. Results and discussion The results listed in Table I demonstrate that using metal reducing agents instead of NaBH4 can affect not only the activity, but also the product distribution. Especially, the catalyst system DPA(Na)/NiCI2.6H20/ Zn can improve the activity and the content of lower olefins, as compared to the original system DPA(Na)/ NiCI2-6H20/NaBH4. In the patent [31, the activity lbr 2.5 of NaBHJ NiCI2 molar ratio is lower than that lbr 2.0. Because NaBH4 reacts with the solvent, 1,4-butanediol, at room temperature, the decrease in the activity is probably due to the products formed by reacting NaBH4 and 1,4-butanediol. Since zinc powder is more stable than sodium borohydride in these reaction conditions, the possibility of adding an excess amount of zinc in the system was studied. Unexpectedly, the activity highly increases as the molar ratio of zinc/ NiCI2-6H20 rises from 2 to 8 and increases slowly from 8 to 20 (see Table 2). It was suspected that an excess of zinc could reactivate the deactivated catalyst in the reaction period. The effect of the zinc amount on linear ~-olefin formation is not much. Since zinc powder transforms to bivalent zinc cation in the catalyst system DPA(Na)/NiCI2-6H20/ Zn during the preparation of catalyst in situ. the effect of the Zn2~- cation on ethylene oligomerization was also studied. Ethylene oligomerization was investi- gated by adding ZnCI2 in the different catalyst systems DPA(Na)/NiCI2.6H20/NaBH4 and DPA(Na)/ Ni(cod)2. The results are listed in Table 3. It shows that the contents of lower olefins, especially butene, increase by adding ZnC12, and there is less change in the activity. Also it has been confirmed by our experi- ments that cations and anions existing in the reaction solution have a great effect on the oligomerization of ethylene. So the high selectivity to lower olefins in the system DPA(Na)/NiCI2.6H20/Zn is likely to be caused by the Zn2 ~ cation produced in the reduction of NiCI2-6H20. Both the protonic solvent and non-protonic solvent were used in ethylene oligomerization. It was /ound that only in the protonic solvents the oligomerization of ethylene could take place (see Table 4). It was deduced that in the non-protonic solvents the catalyst active species could not be produced in this system. The reason is discussed in this paper. The results of ethylene oligomerization in different alcohols were quite different. The solvent affects not only the activity, but also the product distribution. However, the difference due to the linear ~-olefin content is not much. Nickel hydride complexes have been proposed as the catalytically active species [6,7]. Fortunately, attempts to trap the signal of nickel hydride in the catalyst system DPA(Na)/NiCIz/Zn were successful Table 1 Oligomerization of ethylene with different catalyst systems :' System Activity/(g/g,~,.h) Pr(xluct distribution/'~.

The mixture of methanol and deuterated methanol (1 : 1) was used as a solvent in the tests. Without ethylene in the system DPA(Na)/NiCIJZn, was a signal at -22.8 ppm mea- sured at -20 C, and the signal disappeared quickly at room temperature. It can be assigned to a nickel hydride (Ni-H) according to the literature [7,9]. Because there are no active hydrogen compounds in L258 D.-b. Liu, D.-g. Li/Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) L255-L258 this system except the solvent, methanol, the hydrogen atom of nickel hydride (Ni-H) must come from the solvent. No activity is probably due to the absence of any active hydrogen atom in the non-protonic solvent. How the protonic solvent reacts with the components of the system is being studied in our laboratory. References [2] W. Keim, A. Behr, B. Gruber. B. Hoffmann, EH. Kowaldt, U.
