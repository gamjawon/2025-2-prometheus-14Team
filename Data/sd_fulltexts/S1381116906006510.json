Graphical abstract Exploration of the kinetic behavior of electronically modified Hoveyda-type catalysts in ADMET polymerization at various temperatures. Not only complexes bearing larger NHC ligands consistently afford higher degrees of polymerization, but the electronically modified catalysts tested exhibit the fastest initial rates ever witnessed in ADMET chemistry. The influence of the ligand sphere's electronics/sterics on catalytic activity was investigated at various temperatures for complexes of the type (L)(Cl)2Ru=CH(o-iPrOC6H3X) (L=H2IPr or H2IMes, X=NO2, Cl, H, CH3, OCH3). Their kinetic behavior was evaluated under ADMET polymerization conditions. At all temperatures the steric hindrance brought about by the N-heterocyclic carbene H2IPr dominates any electronic effect as initial rates remain constant regardless of the X substituent. Nevertheless, complexes bearing electron donating groups seem to be more stable and result in higher DPs than complexes bearing electron withdrawing groups. In any case, catalysts containing larger NHC ligands are more efficient in ADMET chemistry than any modified Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst. At 60°C, the electronic factor becomes evident and the substituted catalysts exhibit significantly higher reactivity, resulting in the fastest initial rates ever witnessed in an ADMET reaction. Keywords Ruthenium catalyst ADMET Kinetic behavior 1 Introduction Over the past decade, olefin metathesis has become a major synthetic method for the formation of C–C bonds [1], especially since the discovery of the Grubbs’ functional group tolerant ruthenium carbene catalyst 1 [2]. Its reactivity was further enhanced by exchanging one phosphine with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand (complexes 2a [3] and 2b [4], Fig. 1 ). This phosphine mimic, being a strong σ-donor but a weak π-acceptor, favors the binding of olefinic substrates to ruthenium, which results in higher turnovers [3–5]. Since then, other modified complexes have been reported, among them the Hoveyda-type catalysts bearing an isopropoxystyrene ligand (3a and 3b, Fig. 1) [6]. The chelating nature of the ligand provides an exceptional stability to this type of catalyst and allows its recovery after some ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and cross-metathesis (CM) reactions [7]. Even though these phosphine-free alkylidenes initiate more slowly than their phosphine analogs, they have gathered much interest for both their ease of use and their enhanced reaction rates with electron deficient olefins. In addition, the isopropoxystyrene ligand represents an ideal anchor point for modification studies involving the introduction of different steric and electronic groups [8] as well as ionic groups [9] and solid supports [10]. Fine tuning of the ligand structure can be achieved for a desired substrate, as the initiation rate and the overall activity of these catalysts have proven very sensitive to the nature of the isopropoxybenzylidene. As suggested by the dissociative mechanism, the catalytic activity can be enhanced by: (1) increasing the steric hindrance around the isopropoxy group, or (2) decreasing the electron density at both the chelating oxygen atom and the benzylidene carbon [8(e,f)]. Our laboratory routinely uses metathesis catalysts for the synthesis of unique macromolecules via acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization [11,12]. The extended lifetime of this particular class of catalyst motivated our interest, since long-living catalysts are desirable considering the reaction times required by ADMET polycondensation. Typically, we evaluate the activity of a catalyst in ADMET through comparative kinetic experiments using standard catalysts 1 and 2a, and 1,9-decadiene as the substrate [13]. This method has allowed us to find optimal conditions of temperature and concentration for a wide range of metathesis catalysts in ADMET chemistry [13(b,c)]. In addition, we have investigated the effect of structural perturbations on catalytic activity in order to model more efficient catalyst systems. For instance, larger substituents around the NHC ligand (2b and 3b) result in faster initial rates while incorporation of isopropoxybenzylidene expands the stability of the complex (3a and 3b) [13(c)]. After developing complex 3b, whose increased activity was more suitable to ADMET polymerization [13(c)], we began to examine the effect of electronics on the isopropoxy fragment of the catalyst. In this report we present a comprehensive study on a series of ruthenium catalysts bearing different isopropoxybenzilydene ligands and different NHC ligands (Fig. 2 ). Their catalytic activity is measured during the ADMET oligomerization of 1,9-decadiene at different temperatures, and their initial rates are compared to standard catalysts for ADMET. 2 Results and discussion Following the introduction of faster initiators by increasing the NHC ligand bulk, we turned our attention to the isopropoxy fragment of the catalyst, the idea being to enjoy the inherent stability of the Hoveyda-type catalysts while improving their catalytic activity in ADMET. Although the influence of electronics and sterics has been studied in much detail in small molecule chemistry [8], the catalytic activity was only observed during monocoupling reactions such as CM or RCM. The polycondensation nature of ADMET renders the catalytic profile very different, hence the use of different parameters to measure catalytic activity in this study. For example, complex 3a has been successful in many organic reactions but only results in low conversions in the ADMET oligomerization of 1,9-decadiene [13(c)]. Therefore, we have applied electronic modifications on complex 3b, which has proven to be an efficient ADMET catalyst. The design of catalysts 4b–7b was based on the idea that decreasing the electron density at the chelating iPrO fragment would result in even higher catalytic activities, the ultimate goal being the elaboration of a Hammett plot. The same modifications were applied to complex 3a to control the influence of sterics on the NHC ligand. The ligands were obtained from the corresponding substituted o-hydroxybenzaldehyde which was subjected to a Williamson substitution followed by a Wittig reaction. The synthesis of complexes 4–7 then followed the same procedure as for complex 3a and 3b, affording good to excellent yields (83–95%) [6]. All complexes are stable in solution and in air. Each catalyst was subjected to a systematic reaction with 1,9-decadiene using a 450:1 monomer:catalyst ratio to reproduce typical polymerization conditions. Reaction progress was followed by quantifying ethylene as it was released, and the degree of polymerization was plotted against time [13(a)]. The catalytic activity was evaluated in comparison with 3a and 3b at 30, 45 and 60°C. 2.1 Steric effect Table 1 shows the initial rates for catalysts 3 and 4 at different temperatures, calculated as the initial slope (DP versus time, Fig. 3 ) of each kinetic curve during the average dimerization (DP=2) of the monomer [14]. Rates increase with temperature for all complexes, and a straight line is obtained when the log of the initial rate is plotted against 1/T, verifying the Arrhenius law. The activation energies E a are estimated to be 40.2 and 48.9kJmol−1 s−1 for 3b and 4b, respectively. Introduction of the nitro group on the isopropoxybenzylidene results in an increase of the initial rate for both catalysts, for indeed, the presence of the electron withdrawing substituent para to the isopropoxy group should facilitate the ligand dissociation by decreasing the electron density on the coordinating oxygen, leading to the active species [15]. However, a closer examination at Table 1 indicates that the electronic effect is only minimal for catalyst 4a, bearing the mesityl NHC ligand, conversely to what was observed in monocoupling reactions [8(f),16]. Indeed, catalysts 3a and 4a exhibit comparable initial rates regardless of the temperature (around 20DPs−1 at 45°C, and 42DPs−1 at 60°C). This observation emphasizes the fundamental difference between small molecule metathesis and ADMET, where the initial rate is not necessarily a direct correlation of the isopropoxystyrene dissociation rate, but also involves the stability of the 14e− complex. In this case, the propagating species RuCH(CH2)6CHCH2 is the same for catalysts 3a and 4a. The similarity of the initial rates obtained here, regardless of the dissociating ligand, seems to indicate that the propagation step is rate determining in ADMET, i.e. that dissociation is fast. In the case of catalysts 3b and 4b, containing a bulkier NHC ligand, the nitro group seems to have a smaller effect on the initial rate, if any, at 30 and 45°C than at 60°C. For example, at 45°C the nitro complex 4b only exhibits a 3DPs−1 rate increase (within the experimental error) compared to parent 3b, while a 50DPs−1 rate increase is reported at 60°C for 4b. The difference at 30°C does not seem significant and will be further investigated by comparing other electronically modified catalysts 5b–7b. The higher rates of complexes 3b and 4b versus 3a and 4a are due to the increase in steric bulk on the NHC ligand brought about by the isopropyl groups, which exert a stronger steric pressure on the benzylidene and therefore facilitate its dissociation [17]. As a consequence, at 60°C complex 4b exhibits one of the fastest initiation rates (117DPs−1) ever reported for the ADMET reaction of 1,9-decadiene. This substituent effect is not as obvious when examining the overall activity of the catalysts 3a–4b (Fig. 3). The ‘tailing off’ of each curve is due to the reaction mixture becoming more viscous as the DP increases until reaching a solid state (around a DP of 4–5) where the rate becomes diffusion controlled. Even so, the catalysts deviate from the initial trend discussed above before reaching the solid state and after dimerization. The catalysts bearing bulkier NHC ligands (3b and 4b) seem to be unaffected by the presence of the nitro group, which is in striking contrast with analogs 3a and 4a. Indeed, complex 4a shows almost a two-fold increase in its overall activity compared to the parent catalyst 3a (at 30min the DPs are 2.8 and 4.1 for 3a and 4a, respectively), while 3b and 4b show the same catalytic profile. The electronic effect on the isopropoxybenzilydene seems to be dominated by the steric hindrance of the NHC ligand. Following the model of ruthenium–phosphine complexes, if the presence of H2IPr facilitates dissociation, then it also slows down catalyst deactivation by rebinding of free phosphine, or in this case, rebinding of the ether-tethered ligand (iPrO) [15(b)]. Thus, complexes 3b and 4b actually undergo more turnovers before being trapped by iPrO. The dissociation/rebinding rates ratio appears to approach an optimum with H2IPr ligands, a ratio that is hardly disturbed by simply changing the electron density around the isopropoxystyrene. On the other hand, the rebinding of iPrO is rendered easier in the presence of the less hindered H2IMes ligand. In this case, the electron density of the coordinating oxygen has a greater effect on both the dissociation and rebinding rates, which explains the higher reactivity of 3b whose nitro-substituted ligand will be less likely to recoordinate and therefore increases the amount of active species able to react. This electronic effect is not evident during the initial rate probably because ligand rebinding only becomes substantial after several turnovers. 2.2 Electronic effect on H2IPr ligated complexes The series of complexes 3b–7b should allow us to better understand the importance of dissociation/rebinding of these ether-tethered ligands. All the synthesized complexes are efficient catalysts for the ADMET oligomerization of 1,9-decadiene reaching DPs of 4 and 5 under 5min at 45°C. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , even at DP>4 (where the viscosity becomes significant) the polymerization continues at a steady rate without any sign of extensive decomposition of the catalytic center, usually observable by a darkening of the solution, confirming the robust nature of these catalysts. Table 2 gives an overview of the initial rates for complexes 3b–7b at 30, 45 and 60°C. As observed earlier, initial rates at 30 and 45°C stay the same regardless of the isopropoxybenzylidene used (around 20DPs−1 at 30°C, and 45DPs−1 at 45°C within experimental error) except for parent catalyst 3b, which exhibits a slightly lower initial rate at 30°C. The difference noticed earlier (Table 1) could have been insignificant if the rates of the electronically modified catalysts 4b–7b had not been so reproducible. The singularity of the unsubstituted catalyst 3b proves the existence of an electronic effect, albeit not qualitative. This lack of sensitivity to the electronic nature of the substituent is again in significant contrast to what was observed during CM and RCM reactions catalyzed by 3a analogs; however, other reports have also referred to the unpredictability of other electronically modified Hoveyda-type catalysts [8(e,f),18]. Here, the steric hindrance present on the NHC ligand seems to overshadow the electronic nature of the dissociating ligand at low temperatures, canceling the effect predicted by sigma values [19]. This proposal finds credence in the X-ray structure of 3b, 4b and 7b. The Ru–O bond length, usually indicative of the strength of the iPrO→Ru chelation, does not show significant variation. Conversely, nitro-substituted 4b exhibits a slightly shorter Ru–O bond length (2.2462(3)Å) while methoxy-substituted 7b's is slightly longer (2.2486(18)Å). At 45°C all complexes follow about a similar catalytic profile, i.e. there is no major improvement brought about by the electronic substituents. However, there is a noticeable distinction between complexes (Fig. 4). Electron donating groups (EDG) appear to increase the catalytic activity while electron withdrawing groups (EWG) reduce the rate. Since the initial rates at 30 and 45°C are the same for all catalysts, the dissociation rate of isopropoxybenzylidene cannot be the only determining factor. Theoretically, after dissociation the propagating species is the same for complexes 3b–7b. Therefore, the lability of isopropoxystyrene must allow its rebinding to the ruthenium center so that it influences the overall catalytic activity. The trend observed at 45°C can be rationalized by considering the formation of the unstable 14e− species, either the alkylidene or the methylidene complex. In an earlier report, we demonstrated the sensitivity of this type of catalyst to substrate polarity compared to their phosphine analogs [13(c)]. In the latter, the phosphine coordinates back to the 14e− intermediate to stabilize it and forms a dormant state [17]. In Hoveyda-type complexes, this type of stabilization is lessened by the extreme lability of isopropoxy styrene. However, all substrates conventionally used to probe the metathesis activity of any catalyst contain some heteroatom that can serve as a stabilizer, along with the solvent used for the reaction. For example, during the ROMP reaction of diverse oxygen-containing monomers, Khosravi and co-workers showed that Hoveyda-type catalysts were stabilized through the chelation of an oxygen contained in the monomer unit [21]. In the case of substrates lacking any kind of electron donor or Lewis basic group, such as 1,9-decadiene, the 14e− intermediate is not stabilized; therefore, the catalyst is more susceptible to decomposition, which results in slower rates. With this in mind, it is reasonable to assume that the catalysts with higher dissociation rates and/or slower rebinding rates should have a lower overall activity. According to sigma values, electron withdrawing substituents para to the isopropoxy group should facilitate the ligand dissociation by decreasing the electron density on the coordinating oxygen and increase its lability, while electron donating substituents should slow the dissociation step and facilitate its rebinding. Simply stated, donating groups should slow down catalyst decomposition. Consequently, complexes 6 and 7 (EDG) show a slightly higher reactivity than complexes 4 and 5 (EWG), while neutral complex 3b lies in between (Fig. 2). 2.3 Temperature effect When the temperature is raised to 60°C, the singularity of catalyst 3b over the electronically modified 4b–7b is accentuated. While initial rates for catalysts 4b–7b are all around 120DPs−1, parent complex 3b only affords a rate of 70DPs−1, broadly deriving from the predicted Arrhenius plot. Electronics now represent a determining factor on catalytic activity, which may be the result of a switch in the mechanism possibly due to a change in catalyst conformation. Similar temperature activation barriers have been witnessed with nitrogen-chelated complexes [22]. The same catalytic profile persists as the reaction continues, and the overall activity is now significantly higher for the modified catalysts 4b–7b (Fig. 5 ). This suggests that the steric effect of the H2IPr ligand is no longer dominant, even though the electronic factor cannot be qualified according to sigma values. This apparent lack of sensitivity towards the electronic nature of the substituents is more likely the result of several mechanistic processes operating simultaneously. While electron withdrawing groups could facilitate dissociation by weakening the iPrO→Ru chelation, electron donating groups could equally increase catalytic activity by reducing the Lewis acidity of the metal. The rate of decomposition of the methylidene intermediate, which is accelerated at elevated temperatures, is probably an important factor. Also, if we consider that the H2IPr ligand does not hinder the rebinding of the iPrO moiety, the 14e− species can be properly stabilized, but, since the dissociation is quite fast, the catalyst returns to the catalytic cycle affording higher DPs. The diminished steric effect may be due to a reorganization of the NHC ligand, possibly by ring rotation, often seen at high temperatures. 3 Conclusions This report gives a different outlook on the influence of the ligand sphere's electronics/sterics on Hoveyda-type metathesis catalysts. Unlike most modification studies conducted on these complexes, the ‘steric factor’ is only located on the NHC ligand (isopropyl versus methyl groups) whereas the ‘electronic factor’ is on the isopropoxybenzilydene. All the complexes tested are efficient catalysts for the ADMET polymerization of 1,9-decadiene. However, in the polycondensation conditions of ADMET, the steric hindrance largely dominates any electronic effect at all temperatures. Interestingly, unsubstituted complex 3b curiously stands out at 30 and 60°C, suggesting some participation of electronics in the catalytic potential of these Hoveyda-type complexes. The overall activity of these complexes seems to depend only on the propensity of the isopropoxystyrene ligand to rebind to the ruthenium center and stabilize it in a similar way as their phosphine analogs, especially at low temperatures. As a result, complexes bearing EWGs result in lower DPs than complexes bearing EDGs, the more active catalyst being the better stabilized. In any case, complexes ligated to larger NHC ligands are better catalysts than any modified Hoveyda–Grubbs such as 4a, again showing the prevalence of sterics over electronics. At 60°C, all electronically modified catalysts exhibit comparable initial rates and increased reactivities, while parent complex 3b constitutes a significant exception. The catalytic profiles of 4b–7b are similar and lay 2 DP over 3b's, implying that the different electronic groups are able to improve activity through different processes. A reorganization of the ligand sphere may occur at higher temperatures so that the steric bulk of the NHC ligand does not hinder the rebinding of isopropoxystyrene anymore. Consequently, catalysts 4b–7b represent the fastest initiators ever tested for ADMET polymerization. Further experiments will be conducted to investigate the importance of ligand rebinding in these Hoveyda-type catalyts, which represent an interesting prospect for metathesis polycondensation. 4 Experimental 4.1 General 1H NMR (300MHz) and 13C NMR (75Hz) spectra of the organometallic complexes were recorded in CDCl3 on either a Mercury series or Varian VXR-300 NMR superconducting spectrometer. Chemical shifts were referenced to residual CHCl3 (7.27 for 1H and 77.23 for 13C) with 0.03% (v/v) TMS as an internal reference. Complex 3a was a gift from Materia Inc. and was used as received. Complexes 2a [3], 2b [4], 3b [13(c)], and 4a [16] were synthesized according to the literature procedure. All catalysts were stored in an argon-filled drybox prior to use in kinetic and polymerization experiments. 1,9-Decadiene (Aldrich) was distilled from Na/K alloy under reduced pressure into a Kontes flask equipped with a Teflon valve, degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, and stored in an argon-filled drybox. For the kinetic study, 1,9-decadiene was portioned into small Teflon-capped vials in the drybox and were removed and stored in a dessicator until use. All other starting material were distilled over Na/K alloy before use except chlorinated compounds which were distilled over CaH2. After distillation, d-chloroform was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, and stored in an argon-filled drybox. 4.2 General procedure for ligand synthesis 2-Isopropoxystyrene derivatives were synthesized by a standard Wittig reaction on the 2-isopropoxybenzylaldehyde parent using (methyl)triphenylphosphine iodide and potassium t-butoxide (Aldrich). All the 2-isopropoxybenzylaldehyde derivatives were synthesized via a Wilkinson-ether synthesis from the corresponding salicylaldehyde (Aldrich) and 2-bromopropane (Aldrich). Spectral data for 1-isopropoxy-2-vinyl-4-methylbenzene [8(e)], 1-isopropoxy-2-vinyl-4-nitrobenzene [16], and 1-isopropoxy-2-vinyl-4-methoxybenzene [18] match the literature. 4.3 General procedure for carbene exchange In a glovebox complex 2a (300mg, 0.32mmol) and CuCl (Aldrich) (32mg, 0.32mmol) were weighed into a 100mL schlenk flask and dissolved in 15mL of CH2Cl2. 2-Isopropoxy-5-nitrostyrene (133mg, 0.64mmol) was dissolved in 5mL of CH2Cl2 and added to the solution of complex 2a and CuCl at room temperature. The flask was equipped with a condenser and the solution was refluxed for 30min or until the brown solution turns to a deep green. From this point forth, all manipulations were carried out in air with reagent-grade solvents. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to a green residue. The unpurified material was dissolved in a minimal volume of 5:2cyclohexane/ethyl acetate and loaded onto a plug of silica gel. Insoluble copper–phosphine precipitates were removed prior to loading by passing the solution through a second Pasteur pipette containing a plug of glass wool. Elution with 5:2cyclohexane/ethyl acetate removed a bright green band from the column. The solvent was evaporated and the residue washed with n-pentane. 4.3.1 Synthesis of complex 4b (–NO2) The general procedure was followed to afford 200mg (0.267mmol, 83%) of a green powder. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300MHz): δ =16.32 (s, 1H, Ru=CHPh), 8.40 (d, 1H, para CH, 2J H,H =8.4Hz), 7.70 (s, 1H, ortho CH), 7.58 (t, 2H, para CH, 3J H,H =7.2Hz), 7.39 (d, 4H, meta CH), 6.90 (d, 1H, meta CH, 2J H,H =8.4Hz), 4.98 (sept, 1H, (CH3)2CHOAr, 3J H,H =6.3Hz), 4.20 (s, 4H, N(CH 2)2N), 3.54 (sept, 4H, CH(CH3)2, 3J H,H =6.6Hz), 1.40 (d, 6H, OCH(CH 3)2, 2J H,H =6.3Hz), 1.24 (d, 24H, CH(CH 3)2, 3J H,H =7.1Hz); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75MHz): δ =284.4, 210.6, 156.9, 149.3, 143.9, 143.2, 136.4, 130.3, 124.7, 124.3, 117.0, 113.0, 77.9, 54.8, 29.1, 27.1, 26.8, 21.9.

So the initial rate cannot be assumed as a direct measurement of the dissociation rate, even though they are tightly correlated [15] For studies on the dissociative mechanism of Hoveyda-type complexes see: (a) Ref.

A large positive σ− value implies high electron withdrawing power by inductive and/or resonance effect; a large positive σ+ value implies high electron-donating power [20] C. Hansch A. Leo R.W.

        "dc:description": "The influence of the ligand sphere's electronics/sterics on catalytic activity was investigated at various temperatures for complexes of the type (L)(Cl)2Ru=CH(o-iPrOC6H3X) (L=H2IPr or H2IMes, X=NO2, Cl, H, CH3, OCH3). Their kinetic behavior was evaluated under ADMET polymerization conditions. At all temperatures the steric hindrance brought about by the N-heterocyclic carbene H2IPr dominates any electronic effect as initial rates remain constant regardless of the X substituent. Nevertheless, complexes bearing electron donating groups seem to be more stable and result in higher DPs than complexes bearing electron withdrawing groups. In any case, catalysts containing larger NHC ligands are more efficient in ADMET chemistry than any modified Hoveyda–Grubbs catalyst. At 60°C, the electronic factor becomes evident and the substituted catalysts exhibit significantly higher reactivity, resulting in the fastest initial rates ever witnessed in an ADMET reaction.",
