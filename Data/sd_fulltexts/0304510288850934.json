N. SHELIMOV*, I. V. ELEV and V. B. KAZANSKY JV. D. Zeiinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Moscow 117913 (U.S.S.R.) Summary The formation mechanism of molybdenum-carbene intermediates, arising from the interaction of ethylene, propene and cyclopropane with Mo4\"*\" ions in photoreduced silica-molybdena catalysts for olefin metathesis, was studied by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and mass spectrom- etry. It was shown that, at 293 K, C^ii^ interacts with Mo4\"1\" to give rise to propene, while when CaHg contacts Mo4\"1\" superequilibrium concentrations of butenes and small amounts of pentenes are observed in the gas phase. A considerable kinetic isotope effect was found when C^H.^ to be metathesized was replaced by CaDg. The data obtained are well explained by the isomer- ization of the surface olefinic Tr-complexes to the corresponding molyb- denum-carbene species via intramolecular 1,2-H atom transfer. Cyclo- propane is strongly chemisorbed on the photoreduced Mo4\"'\" ions at room temperature, forming a metallocyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes further at this temperature to form carbenes Mo=CH2 and Tr-complexes with Mo4\"*\". Carbenes Mo^CH^ are found to be thermally stable up to ~700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and characterized by an absorption band at 460 - 480 nm in the optical spectra. Introduction In our earlier work [1] it was shown that photoreduction of Mo6\"^ SiO^ in carbon monoxide at room or lower temperatures resulted in both the selective reduction of supported Mo6\"*\" ions to the Mo4'1\" state and the appearance of high catalytic activity in the propene metathesis reaction. A specific activity of photoreduced catalysts expressed in 'turnover numbers', i.e. m numbers of propene molecules converted over one molybdenum ion per second, (TON), at 300 K and at the initial propene pressure of about 50 ton\" is equal to 0.4 - 0.5 s\"1 and considerably exceeds that of the catal- ysts, activated by thermal reduction in H^ or CO at 773 - 873 K (TON = * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 188 0.003 - 0.07 s~1 at 300 K). By photoreduction of Mo^/SiOz it was possible to obtain catalysts which were even more active than one of the best catal- ysts for propene metathesis, produced by 'anchoring' the organomolyb- denum compound Mo( 173-03115)4 on silica (TON = 0.13 - 0.17 s\"1 [2]). It was also found [1] that the catalytic activity of the photoreduced Mo/SiO; samples is associated with the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface Mo44 ions, on which active intermediates of the metathesis reaction are formed. It is generally accepted that the metathesis reaction proceeds via a chain carbene scheme. Initially this concept was developed for homogeneous catal- ytic systems [3-5], but recently the chain carbene mechanism was shown to be also valid for heterogeneous systems, and in particular, for alumina- molybdena catalysts [6, 7]. According to this mechanism, propene meta- thesis occurs via a successive interchange of methylene and ethylidene carbene species on the same active site: +C3H(, +C;iH(, Mo=CH2 _ > Mo=CHCH3 ^ Mo^CH; '^itii^ \"4\"8 Although the hypothesis on the carbene nature of the intermediates involved in the olefin metathesis is now generally accepted, the problem of the mechanism of their formation on the surface of heterogeneous oxide catalysts is still under discussion. A number of reaction schemes have been proposed in the literature, explaining the metal-carbene intermediate formation as the result of olefin interaction with transition metal com- plexes (see below). Generally speaking, one can choose in favor of this or that reaction scheme by analysing the initial products of the olefin inter- action with reduced molybdenum ions (in particular, Mo4\"*\"), which are supposed to be precursors of the active centers. It is also known that metal-carbene species can be formed when cyclopropane interacts with metathesis catalysts containing transition metal ions. For example, an immediate and vigorous evolution of ethylene, already observed at 78 C, was shown to occur when a solution of the C^Hs- WC13-A1C13 complex in chlorobenzene reacted with cyclopropane, while the reaction of R-substituted cyclopropanes (R = C^H;, n^Hc or iso- C3H.7) with the same solution at 25 C yielded both ethylene and alkenes R CH=CH2 [8]. It was suggested [8] that cyclopropanes reacted with CeHgWCIs to form metallocyclobutane intermediates, which dissociated into metal-carbene complexes and olefins under reaction conditions. Hall et al. [9] have found that at the initial stages of the cyclopropane interaction with reduced alumina-molybdena catalysts for olefin metathesis (8% Mo/- Al;03) cyclopropane could be completely converted to ethylene according to the following scheme: r-iTJ _r^i-r Oft__^Mo 'i\"2 OH2 HaC ^-^^CHa > Mo CH; > Mo=CH^ + C^ 189 Thus, although chemical evidence for the formation of metal-carbene species on the surface of oxide catalysts seems to be quite reliable, no spectroscopic evidence for their formation has been obtained so far. Obvi- ously, for a successful mechanistic study of the metal-carbene species pro- duced by the olefin or cyclopropane interaction with reduced transition metal ions, the highest possible number of such centers should be produced and they should be homogeneous to avoid side reactions. Probably, silica- molybdena catalysts photoreduced in CO meet both these require- ments. In these catalysts, because of the specificity of a low temperature photoreduction process, a major part of the original Mo6\"1\" ions can be smoothly converted to the Mo4\"1\" state with practically 100% selectivity [10]. These samples appear to be optimal for the spectroscopic study of Tr-allyl and carbene intermediates. Experimental The Mo^/SiO^ samples (1 or 0.076 wt.% of Mo) were obtained by impregnation of silica gel KSK2-5 (S = 360 m2 g~1) with an aqueous solution of ammonium paramo lybdate. Pretreatment of the catalyst samples (0.1 - 0.2 g) was carried out in optical quartz cells. The following pretreatment procedure was used: A. For freshly prepared catalyst samples only evacuation to 10~4 torr while continuously raising the temperature (~5 K min~1) to 1073 K; B. Heating the sample in dry oxygen (100 torr) at 1073 K for 1.5 - 2.0 h, outgassing for 1.5 - 2.0 h at the same temperature and cooling to 423 K. The sample was then treated in oxygen (10 torr) for 10 -15 min, cooled to room temperature and evacuated to 10~4 torr. Photoreduction of Mo^/SiO^ in CO (10-30 torr) was performed at room temperature under irradiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp DRSh-1000 (l kW), equipped with a water filter and a system of quartz lenses, for 1.5 - 2.0 h. CO; formed during irradiation was frozen out in a cold (77 K) trap. The amount of reduced Mo4\"'\" ions was determined by measuring the number of CO; molecules evolved [10]. After photoreduction the samples were outgassed at 473 K to remove chemisorbed carbon monox- ide. Thermal reduction in CO or HI at pressures of 50 - 70 torr was carried out at 773 K while circulating reducing gas through the catalyst bed. The reduction products (CO^ or H^O) were condensed in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen. The catalyst was then pumped off at 773 K to 10~4 torr. Carbon monoxide used in this study was purified by passage through a column with reduced Cr^/SiO; adsorbent and a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen. Cyclopropane, ethylene and propene were purified by repeated (usually 3) freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Volumetric measurements were carried out in a calibrated glass vacuum system supplied by a McLeod gauge. Temperature-programmed thermal 190 desorption curves were taken using a Pyrani gauge at heating rates of 4 - 5 K min\"1. The products of the ethylene, propene and cyclopropene interactions with the photoreduced samples were analysed with a UTI-100 C quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mixtures of olefins of a known composition were used for calibration. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the range of 200 - 2000 nm were recorded using a MgO pellet as reference with a Hitachi Model M-340 spectrophoto meter. Results and discussion Mechanism of formation of molybdenum-carbene intermediates As previously reported [I], ethylene and propene are strongly chemis- orbed on the photoreduced Mo^/SiC^ samples at room temperature, appar- ently forming Tr-complexes with the Mo4\"1\" ions. These complexes are char- acterized by a broad absorption band at 580 - 600 nm in the optical diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. Ib). They are thermally stable; olefin desorption was found to occur only at 573 - 623 K, Mo4'*\" ions in the original coordina- tion state being regenerated. In the case of thermally reduced samples, no 300 500 700 tnnil Fig. l.

Apparently, this could be due to lower concentrations of coor- dinatively unsaturated Mo4\"*\" ions in such catalysts, or to their coordinative nonhomogeneity. A certain fraction of chemisorbed olefin molecules might undergo a further conversion in the Mo4* coordination sphere, even at room temper- ature. This is evidenced by changes in the gas phase composition observed during the initial steps of Mo4'*\" interaction with olefins. Corresponding data are given in Tables 1 and 2. When C^H.4 comes in contact with unreduced Mo^/SiO; samples at room temperature, with the ratio N^^/NCMo6*) being close to unity (Table 1, Exp. 2), the percentage of C^H^ and C4H8 impurities somewhat decreases in comparison to that in the starting ethylene, indicating preferen- tial adsorption of heavier olefins on unreduced Mo^'^/SiO;. At the same time, there was no noticeable ethylene adsorption on such samples. When ethylene contacted photoreduced Mo^/SiO; samples at various MCaHy/A^Mo6'*') ratios (Exps. 3 and 4), the CaHg concentration m the gas phase increased, in comparison with the blank experiment 2. The CaHe per- centage m the gas phase increased even further, when chemisorbed C^H.^ was desorbed m a Ha flow (Exp. 4) or in vacuum at 673 K (Exp. 5). Thus, one can conclude that the C^HU interaction with photoreduced samples results in the production of some propene. After a portion of CjD^ (80% of D atoms) was placed in contact with a photoreduced Mo4+/Si02 sample for 15 min (at NiC-iD^fNiMo6'') ^2), no TABLE 1 Interaction of the photoreduced Mo^/SiO^ samples with ethylene Exp.

When propene came into contact with photoreduced Mo^/SiOz, the gas phase composition changed considerably (Table 2), since such samples are highly active catalysts for CaHc metathesis. However, it should be noted that at MCaHg^MMo4\"1\") < 1 (Table 2, Exps. 3 and 4) a considerable devia- tion from the equilibrium gas phase composition was observed : under these conditions the percentage of propene conversion and the butene content in the gas phase essentially exceed the corresponding equilibrium values. More- over, in contrast to the equilibrium mixture, the C4Hg/C2H4 ratio was much higher than unity. This effect became even more pronounced during desorp- tion of chemisorbed propene in H; flow at 573 K (Exp. 3). Thus, at the initial stages of the CaHg interaction with Mo44^ ions, butenes were predom- inantly produced. In addition, in this case pentenes were also observed to evolve in the gas phase (Table 2, last column). In Exp. 4 the amount of pen- tenes reached a maximum at MCsH^/A^Mo4\"1\") < 1, and afterwards, as this ratio increased the pentene concentrations decreased. At TV^H^/A^Mo4\"1') > 3 the pentene percentage in the gas phase decreased by more than two orders of magnitude. In Table 3 TONs for propene metathesis over a photoreduced Mo4+/- Si02 sample are given, obtained after three successive admissions of deuter- ated and undeuterated propenes, with intermediate outgassing of the catalyst. The smaller rate of metathesis in Exp. 3 compared with that in Exp. 1 is due to a partial deactivation of the catalyst, in agreement with the results reported earlier [1]. On the other hand, a considerable increase in activity in 193 TABLE 3 Isotope effect in propene metathesis over the photoreduced Mo^/SiO^ sample Exp.

Therefore, one can conclude that propene interaction with Mo4\"1\" ions apparently involves a reaction step in which rupture and/or formation of a C H bond occurs. As seen below, this conclusion is of essential importance for proper selection of the mechanism for carbene intermediates formation. It is useful to correlate the data obtained with possible mechanisms of olefin transformation to carbene species, discussed in the literature. The following schemes should be considered: (1) Intramolecular 1,2-H atom transfer via intermediate formation of an allyl complex [7, 11,12] : H Mo H KK ^R ^-9^ Mo H' 'H H /H \"C-C-R J H Mo (2) ir-complex conversion to T^-allyl complex, followed by its transfor- mation to a metallocyclobutane intermediate [6, 13 -15] : HaC+CH-CHaR __, HaC-C^CHR ' ( '' .''

Scheme 3 can also be ruled out on the following grounds: (a) the presence of hydride-like species on the surface of Mo'^/SiO;, photoreduced in CO, is unlikely; (b) no change m H/D ratio was observed when C2D4 contacted the catalyst. Mechanism 2, proposed for alumina-molybdena catalysts, does not agree with the following data, obtained for the photoreduced Mo^/SiO; system: (a) carbene formation via transformation of ^-allyl complex is not possible for C^H^, although the Mo^/SiO; samples were found to be highly active for 'degenerate' ethylene metathesis [19]; (b) one would expect an excess of ethylene in the gas phase at the initial stages of the C3H5 interaction with Mo4\"*\" ions, while predominant butene formation actually takes place (Table 2). Let us now consider mechanism 1, already known in organometallic chemistry. Recently it has been shown [7, 11] that it can be successfully applied to describe activation of propene molecules over Mo4+/Al203 catalysts obtained by decomposition of 'anchored' organomolybdenum complexes, and to explain a kinetic isotope effect found for the metathesis of CD2=CH CH3 molecules. Lower initial metathesis rates for CD2=CH CH3 compared with that for CH2=CH CH3 are apparently associated with rupture of the C D bond at the initial stages of the catalytic reaction, in agreement with mechanism 1. A kinetic isotope effect in the metathesis of C3De, found in our experiments over the photoreduced Mo^/SiOz catalysts, as well as the pro- duct distribution at the initial stages of the olefin interaction with Mo4\"1\" ions, are well explained by mechanism 1. Indeed, when ethylene contacts the Mo4\"1' ions, evolution of propene is expected in the gas phase: r/~ii_r HiC+CHi __, CH-CHs + ^\"4, | 3 __, * ^^ II < ) HC CHi ^=^ Mo=CH2+C3He \"1 J Mo I I _Mo OH;, Interaction of Mo4\"*' with propene molecules occurs according to Scheme 1 in the following way: H2C^CH-CH3 <=^ Mo=CH-CH2-CH3 Mo Carbene species Mo=CH CH2 CH3 can react with the second propene molecule in two ways, leading to the production of butene and pentene: 195 Mo=CH-CH2-CH3 + CsHfi [H^C-CH-CHa 1 CH, / l l II + CsHio / l Mo-CH-CH^-CHai i=i Mo rCHs-CH-CH, 1 CH-CHa Mo CH-CHi-CHaJ i==^ Mo + C4Hg The formation of ethylene is possible only on the approach of the third C3H6 molecule to the active site: Mo=CH2 + C3He<=^Mo=CH-CH3 + C2H4 although butene formation is also possible: Mo=CH-CH3 + C^-<= Mo=CH2 + C4Hs The data m Tables 1 and 2 are seen to be in good agreement with the reaction scheme discussed above. Cyclopropane interaction with Mo4\"1\" ions in photoreduced silica-molybdena catalysts: formation of stable carbene species The data of Table 4 show that at room temperature there is cyclopro- pane (CP) chemisorption on the photoreduced Mo^/SiOa samples, the aver- age ratios Nads (CP)/W(Mo4\"1\") being ~ 0.7. No conversion products of CP were detected mass-spectroscopically in the gas phase contacting the photored- uced silica-molybdena samples. CP was also chemisorbed on the thermally reduced samples, but in smaller amounts than on the photoreduced Mo4\"^- SiOi. No CP chemisorption was found on unreduced samples containing only Mo6\"*\" ions. Adsorbed CP is strongly bound to the surface of the photoreduced Mo^/SiO^ and could not be removed by evacuation of the sample at temper- atures below 500 K. At higher temperatures, a considerable desorption of gases, consisting of >95% C^, 4 - 5% Cyfif, (propene + CP) and <1% CoHg, was mass-spectroscopically observed. The last column of Table 4 shows that at temperatures higher than 590 - 600 K chemisorbed CP desorbed almost completely with two desorption maxima (at 550 and 580 K) on the thermal desorption curve (Fig. 2). On repeated adsorption at 293 K, the amount of CP adsorbed markedly decreased (Table 4). Oxidation such a sample by oxygen at room temper- ature resulted in the disappearance of the CP chemisorption centers. CP adsorption, followed by desorption of the chemisorption-products was accompanied by a considerable change in UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. In the spectrum of photoreduced Mo^/SiOz in the range ofd-d transi- tions of molybdenum ions there were three absorption bands: at 770,625 and 350 nm (Fig. 3b), assigned earlier [10] to Mo4\"1' ions in distorted tetrahedral 196 TABLE 4 Cyclopropane adsorption on and product desorption from the reduced silica-molybdena catalysts Wt.%ofMo, means of sample activation A^Mo4-1-)8' X1018 MCPIad^ X10 MCP)ads Desorption temp.

As shown in [I], the band at 580 -600 nm is characteristic of olefinic a-complexes with Mo4'1' ions; the origin of the band at 460 - 480 nm will be discussed later. After outgassing of the sample including chemisorbed CP at temper- atures below 520 K, the optical spectrum did not change. At 520 K the band at 580 - 600 nm began to decrease, and had completely disappeared after evacuation of the sample at this temperature for 15 - 30 min. Simultaneously, the bands at 770, 625 and 350 nm of Mo4\"*\" ions reappeared though with several times less intensity than for the original sample. Upon raising the temperature to 570 K, small changes in the band at 460 - 480 nm became noticeable: the maximum at 480 nm disappeared and at the same time the intensity of the band at 460 nm increased (Fig. 3d). Further raising of the temperature up to 720 K did not change the optical spectrum. Repeated CP adsorption at 293 K on such samples gave rise to the spectrum similar to that of Fig. 3c with a slight variation in the intensity ratio of the bands at 460 - 480 and 580 - 600 nm : the former increases, while the latter decreases. The species relating to the band at 460 - 480 nm were stable in the pre- sence of oxygen. After admission of some oxygen at 293 K to the samples having the optical spectra of Fig. 3d, the Mo4\"*\" absorption band irreversibly disappeared due to oxidation of these ions [10], while the intensity of the band at 460 - 480 nm remained almost unchanged (Fig. 4b). After oxygen treatment the sample was no longer able to chemisorb CP, but weakly adsorbed ethylene, propene and hexene-1. Alkene adsorption was accomp- 198 300 500 700 [inn} Fig. 4.

It follows from the data of Table 4 and from the optical spectra, that it is most likely that CP is chemisorbed on the coordinatively unsaturated (eus) Mo4'1' ions, which constitute the major part of the reduced molyb- denum ions in the photoreduced Mo^/SiO; samples, although smaller concentrations are also present in the thermally reduced samples [1]. The CP interaction with Mo4\"*\" ions can be presented by the following scheme: ,.<% Mo^ + H^C ^CH; 293 K H^C CH^ Mo-CHa (I) CH-i^CH? 41 520-570 K Mo^CHi + Mo > Mo=CH2 + MOeus4\"1\" + C^ (Il) CH a^CH CH3 Mo (IV) (III) 520 - 570 K Mo,^ + CaHo A molybdenum-cyclobutane intermediate (I) is apparently unstable at 293 K and decomposes at this temperature mainly to a carbene species 199 (II) and an ethylene molecule, which immediately forms a Tr-complex (III) with the nearest Mo4\"*\" ion. The band at 460 - 480 nm corresponds to the species (II). A certain fraction of the intermediates (I) could isomerize to the propene Tr-complexes (IV). Thus, the band at 580 - 600 nm is most likely due to the Ti-complexes of C^H^ and C^tif, molecules with Mo4\"^ ions. Upon heating the samples in vacua at 520 - 570 K, the ir-complexes (III) and (IV) decompose, but the carbene species (II) survive. Correspond- ingly, the band at 580 - 600 nm disappears, the spectrum of Mo4\"*\" ions is par- tially regenerated and ethylene and small amounts of propene evolve in the gas phase. The two maxima on the thermal desorption curve (Fig. 2) are probably associated with a difference in the decomposition rates of inter- mediates (I) and complexes (III) and (IV). The proposed scheme also ex- plains quite well the observed changes in the optical spectra after repeated CP adsorption. Splitting of the band at 460 - 480 nm after CP chemisorption at room temperature could be interpreted as being due either to structural inhomo- geneity of carbene species (II), or to the presence of a certain number of intermediates (I) on the surface. Thus, we can conclude that CP adsorption at 293 K on the photored- uced Mo^/SiOz followed by heating the samples in vacuo at 520 - 570 K results in the formation of thermally stable and oxygen-resistant carbene species Mo=CH2. The number of such species can be estimated by analysing changes in the isotope composition of a known amount of C2D4 gas on con- tacting the sample containing Mo=CH2 species. We suggest that the following reaction of isotopic exchange can occur: Mo=CH2 + CD2=CD2 <==* Mo=CD2 + CH2=CD2 In one of the experiments 4.4 X 1018 molecules ofdeuterated ethylene (mainly C^D^ molecules, H atom fraction in starting ethylene = 0.035) were allowed to contact a Mo^/SiO-^ sample in which Mo=CH2 species were pro- duced as above (this sample originally contained 7.2 X 1018 photoreduced Mo4'1\" ions). At equilibrium, mainly C2D4, C2D2H2 and Cyii^ molecules were mass-spectroscopically found in the gas phase, the fraction of H atoms in- creasing up to 0.39. Assuming ethylene does not adsorb on the sample under these conditions and, consequently, the number of ethylene molecules in the gas phase remains constant, a simple calculation shows that about 70% of the Mo4\"1\" ions can form carbenes Mo=CH2. Thus, even after a single treatment of the photoreduced samples by CP a considerable portion of the Mo4\"*\" ions can generate carbenes Mo=CH2. In conclusion, it should be noted that further information on the nature of intermediates formed on CP adsorption can be obtained from IR spectroscopic measurements. Such experiments are now in progress and the results will be published elsewhere. 200 References 1 B. N. Shelimov, I. V. Elev and V. B. Kazansky, 3. Catal., 98 (1986) 70. 2 Yu. I. Yermakov, B. N.

The formation mechanism of molybdenum-carbene intermediates, arising from the interaction of ethylene, propene and cyclopropane with Mo4+ ions in photoreduced silica-molybdena catalysts for olefin metathesis, was studied by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. It was shown that, at 293 K, C2H4 interacts with Mo4+ to give rise to propene, while when C3H6 contacts Mo4+ superequilibrium concentrations of butenes and small amounts of pentenes are observed in the gas phase. A considerable kinetic isotope effect was found when C3H6 to be metathesized was replaced by C3D6. The data obtained are well explained by the isomerization of the surface olefinic π-complexes to the corresponding molyb-denum-carbene species via intramolecular 1,2-H atom transfer. Cyclopropane is strongly chemisorbed on the photoreduced Mo4+ ions at room temperature, forming a metallocyclobutane intermediate, which decomposes further at this temperature to form carbenes MoCH2 and π-complexes with Mo4+. Carbenes MoCH2 are found to be thermally stable up to ~700 K, oxygen resistant at 293 K and characterized by an absorption band at 460–480 nm in the optical spectra. References 1 B.N. Shelimov I.V.
