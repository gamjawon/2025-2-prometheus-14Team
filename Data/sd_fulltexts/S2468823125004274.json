The unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), including structural tunability and high specific surface area, are promising for catalytic applications. However, the problem of poor stability limits the development of MOFs catalysts. In this study, a highly stable Ce-MOF was synthesized by combining rare earth Ce with high coordination number and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. The results show that Ce-MOF has good stability in water and alcohol solutions. Moreover, the Ce-MOF-HCOOH after defect treatment still has excellent stability. When used as a catalyst for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), the catalytic yield of Ce-MOF-HCOOH is 3.3 times that of Ce-MOF. Furthermore, Ce-MOF was used as a highly stable carrier loaded with metal Pd to prepare Pd/Ce-MOF catalysts. Excellent yields of 99.9% were achieved for the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin not only in methanol but also in water. Meanwhile, the good stability of Pd/Ce-MOF resulted in excellent reusability. This work developed a highly stable rare-earth MOF materials that not only improve the catalytic performance by defect treatment, but also serve as an excellent carrier for metal catalysts.

MOFs exhibit high porosity and high specific surface areas, and structural flexibility as well as modifiable surface properties that allow for more diverse MOF properties [4–6]. The metal ions or metal clusters that construct MOFs can maintain the stability of their framework on the one hand, and on another hand the ligand-unsaturated metals with Lewis acidity can also be used as catalytically active centres [7]. Among the ligands are also potential active sites, if the ligand has other functional groups besides those involved in the coordination of MOFs, these functional groups can also be used as catalytically active sites. Li et al․ [8] rationally prepared PCN-222(Fe) with a hydrophobic pore environment by post-synthetic modification. The enhanced hydrophobicity as well as the formation of more favorable adsorption of hydrophobic cyclohexane on the modified PCN-222(Fe)-Fn combined with the excellent catalytic activity of the metal ions in the porphyrin centre for cyclohexane oxidation improved its catalytic performance for cyclohexane oxidation. MOFs can also be used as carriers to introduce other catalytically active guests through non-covalent interactions [9]. Metal nanoparticles, as the most widely used multiphase catalysts, are composited with MOFs to obtain metal nanoparticles/MOFs composites that show great potential in catalysis [10,11]. Wang et al․ [12] formed Pt nanoparticles with MOFs to form a hollow composite material (HoMIL-101@Pt@MIL-101) and used it for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin. This not only stabilized the Pt metal nanoparticles increasing the active site, but controlled experiments and theoretical calculations showed that vanillin was mainly adsorbed on the unsaturated Cr site of MIL-101 and hydrogenated by hydrogen spillover. In addition, the catalytic performance is improved by generating new acid-base sites or defects in the catalysts through relevant strategies, in which the presence of oxygen defects not only modulates the coordination structure and electronic state of atoms, but also acts as an anchor point for noble metals and promotes the nucleation and stabilization of deposited metal nanoparticles [13]. Therefore, stable MOFs can not only be used directly as catalysts, but also as carriers to inhibit metal active site agglomeration, which is an excellent platform for a class of catalytic applications [14,15]. The stability of the MOFs itself is particularly important in the catalytic process, including the stability in water as well as in various solutions, which is one of the challenging issues in the development of MOFs catalysts [16]. However, the hydrothermal stability obtained for most MOFs is not satisfactory [17]. The reason is mainly due to the weak strength of the coordination bond between the ligand and the metal. Whereas water molecules can more easily coordinate with the central metal, the easy breakage of the metal-ligand bond eventually leads to the collapse of the structure [18]. In response to this limitation, various strategies to improve the stability of MOFs have been proposed [19,20]. Researchers have used different strategies such as initial synthesis or post-synthesis modification to construct chemically stable MOFs [21,22]. Specifically, these strategies include rational selection of metal ions or ligand atoms to enhance the strength of ligand bonds, post-synthesis exchange (metal ion substitution or ligand exchange), introduction of hydrophobic groups into ligands, use of pore-splitting ligands to delimit the pore space of MOFs, hydrophobic treatment of the surface of MOFs, and increase of interpenetration of MOFs [23–25]. For example, Nijem et al. employed fluorine atoms to modify a MOF and synthesized the FMOF-1 material with hydrophobicity for investigating the formation and stability of H2O clusters in hydrophobic cavities and the absorption rate of methane [26]. Therefore, the design and synthesis of highly stable MOFs are of great significance in the face of the current market demand and application potential of MOFs. The use of highly valent metal ions (Fe3+, Zr4+, etc.) as metal nodes of MOFs materials is one of the methods to improve MOFs stability [19,27]. Cerium metal with high coordination number is the most abundant rare earth element in the earth’s crust. Ce is characterized by an empty 4f shell layer and is the only lanthanide element with both states of Ce3+ and Ce4+ [28]. In addition, the high structural variability due to the high coordination number of Ce as a metal center and the versatility of the ligand make the material more diversified [27]. Moreover, the strong coordination bonds formed by O and N atoms contained in the ligands with cerium ions make Ce-MOF significantly more stable [29]. Chen et al. designed and developed a Ce-MOF (BIT-58) that was prepared by a coordination modulation method to obtain high stability, and the effective modulation of the particle size resulted in a substantial improvement of the catalytic performance [30]. Secondly, Ce-MOF can be used as an ideal carrier, with many potential defect sites and pores which can be used to deposit metal atoms or metal oxides for preventing their aggregation [31]. He et al. investigated the catalytic oxidation performance of Ce-MOF-808 and Zr-MOF-808 after deposition of Cu as a carrier, finding that the catalytic rate of the Ce material was four and twenty times higher than that of the Zr material [14]. Therefore, the development of an efficient and stable Ce-MOF material is promising for catalysis. In this work, a nine-coordinated highly stable Ce-MOF material was obtained by the solvothermal synthesis of Ce as a metal center with the organic ligand 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. The characterization proved that the high stability of this Ce-MOF is not only limited to water, but also expanded to various organic alcohol solutions. Then, the results showed that the Ce-MOF subjected to defective treatment of Ce-MOF-HCOOH possessed excellent stability. Ce-MOF-HCOOH catalyzed the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with a performance 3.3 times higher than that of Ce-MOF. In addition, Ce-MOF was used as an excellent carrier loaded with metal Pd to obtain Pd/Ce-MOF catalysts, which showed excellent hydrodeoxygenation ability in water and organic alcohols. It is evident that highly stable Ce-MOF materials can serve as excellent platforms for catalytic applications. 2 Experiment Part 2.1 Materials Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%), and Pd(NO3)2·2H2O (99.0%) were purchased from Adamas Reagent Co. Ltd. 8-Hydroxyquinoline-5 sulfonic acid (H2QS) (98.0%), ethylenediamine and formic acid were obtained from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co. Ltd. N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used without treatment in the experiments. 2.2 Synthesis of Ce-MOF Ce-MOF was synthesized by adding 2.12 g of Ce(NO3)3∙6H2O and 0.48 g of the organic ligand 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (H2QS), into 70 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. About 1 mL of ethylenediamine was added under stirring conditions and stirred for 1 h at room temperature to form a homogeneous mixed solution. This mixed solution was loaded into a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene lined stainless autoclave, heated in an oven at 100°C for 2 days, cooled to room temperature, and the product was filtered and washed. It was dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80°C for 12 h. 2.3 Synthesis of Defective Ce-MOF-HCOOH The synthesis steps were similar to Ce-MOF, except that 0.026 g of formic acid (MH2QS:MHCOOH=1:0.25) was added before the step of adding ethylenediamine, and all other steps were identical. 2.4 Preparation of Pd/Ce-MOF 0.4 g Ce-MOF was added to 40 mL of water by stirring for 30 min to make the carrier dispersed uniformly. Then, 0.021 g of Pd(NO3)2·2H2O was weighed and stirred with 20 mL of water, after complete dissolution, the obtained palladium nitrate solution was slowly added into the carrier solution and stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Next, the above solution was filtered with a large amount of deionized water. The obtained filter cake was put into a porcelain boat and reduced in a tube furnace equipped with 10% H2/Ar mixture at 200°C for 5 h to obtain the Pd/Ce-MOF catalyst. 2.5 Characterization methods Single crystal data were obtained using Mo Kα X-rays (λ= 0.710173 Å) measured on a Siemens SMART CCD 1000 diffractometer and collected in an ω-scan mode. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 pyrolysis weight analyser in a nitrogen atmosphere at a ramp rate of 10°C min-1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a Rigaku Ultima X-ray diffraction spectrometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) used to characterize the phases of the as-obtained catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis on VISTA-MPX instrument was conducted to determine the metal contents of samples. Fourier Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) recorded by a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer to analyse changes in functional groups and chemical bonding. After pretreatment of the samples under vacuum conditions, the samples were tested for nitrogen adsorption and desorption to obtain the specific surface area and pore properties of the materials using a Micromeritics APSP 2460 under 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on a PHI5000 Versaprobe II scanning XPS microprobe system equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source. The XPS spectra were fitted on the peak analysis software MultiPeak and all peaks were calibrated with C 1s peaks at 284.8 eV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were performed on a FEI Talos F200S instrument, USA. The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) program was used for all density-functional theory calculations. Calculations were performed using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation function at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level of theory. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave group was 400 eV, and a 3 × 3 × 1 grid of k-points in the surface Brillouin zone was used to sample the total energy with a convergence threshold below -0.03 eV Å-1. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was used to minimize the interactions between thin layers. The adsorption energy (Eads) is defined by the following equation: (1) E a d s = E t o t a l − − ( E s l a b + E g ) where Etotal is the total energy of the ideal surface after adsorption, Eslab is the energy of the ideal surface and Eg is the energy of vanillin and H2 in the gas phase. 2.6 Catalytic experiments Oxidation reaction: 50 mg of Ce-MOF/Ce-MOF-COOH, HMF (1 mmol) and isopropanol (8 mL) were added to a 25 mL autoclave. The oxygen was first charged 3-4 times to replace the air in the autoclave, and the reaction was heated from room temperature to 90°C at atmospheric pressure for 4 h. The gas phase was analyzed after cooling to room temperature. Hydrogenation: 50 mg of Pd/Ce-MOF, vanillin (1 mmol) and solvent (8 mL) were weighed and added into a 25 mL autoclave. After charging hydrogen for 3-4 times to remove the air in the autoclave, the kettle was charged with 2 MPa hydrogen and heated from room temperature to 160°C for 6 h. The reaction was cooled down to room temperature and then analyzed in the gas phase. The oxidation and hydrogenation reactions were carried out in the same steps in the cyclic experiments. The catalyst was collected, filtered, washed and dried at 80°C, and then the catalyst was ready for the next reaction under the same conditions. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-7890a, Agilent). The liquid products were diluted with methanol prior to analysis and dodecane was used as an internal standard. The column was kept at 40°C for 1 min, then heated up to 220°C with a gradient of 20°C per minute using nitrogen as carrier gas and detected by a FID detector (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The conversion of the reactants and the selectivity of the products were defined using the equations below: (2) Conversion ( % ) = Mole of reactants converted Mole of reactants invested × 100 % (3) Selectivity ( % ) = Mole of target product generated Mole of all products generated × 100 % 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and Stability of Ce-MOF Fig. 1 a shows the synthesis step of Ce-MOF. Ce-MOF is constructed from the lanthanide element cerium (Ce) together with 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (H2QS) with one-dimensional honeycomb pore (Fig. 1d). The single crystal analysis of X-ray diffraction shows that Ce-MOF is a three-dimensional skeleton structure with P-3 space group. Within the Ce2(QS)3(DMF)3 structural unit, two coordination modes of cerium atoms are found and both are exhibiting coordination number of 9 (Fig. 1b). One of the Ce1 forms a 9-coordination configuration with three hydroxyl oxygen atoms, three sulfonyl oxygen atoms from the six QS ligands, and three oxygen atoms from the DMF, respectively. However, another Ce2 is coordinated with six oxygen atoms and three nitrogen atoms. Three of the oxygen and three of the nitrogen atoms are derived from hydroxyl oxygen atoms on the three equivalent QS ligands and nitrogen atoms on the quinoline ring, which form a 9-coordinated polyhedral configuration with oxygen atoms on the sulfonate groups derived from the other three QSs. Thus, this Ce-MOF is made of three hydroxyl oxygen atoms on the QS as bridging ligands that allow Ce1 and Ce2 to form dimers. These dimers formed a three-dimensional pore structure through the connection of QS organic ligands (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 1e and Table 1 , the Ce-MOF material has a specific surface area of 96.43 m2 g-1, with pore volume and pore size of 0.08 cm3 g-1 and 3.4 nm, respectively. In the pore size distribution plot (Fig. 1e) there is a distribution of pore sizes ranging from microporous to mesoporous structures (1-10 nm), which is in agreement with the emergence of the H4-type adsorption hysteresis loops suggesting the coexistence of micro- and mesoporous structures in the structure [32]. The thermal stability of Ce-MOF under air conditions was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. Fig. 2 a reveals that the weight loss process of Ce-MOF is mainly divided into two stages. The first stage is the loss of water molecules and solvents such as DMF (11.98%) in the pore, mainly in the range of 100-360°C. In the second stage when the temperature rises to 425°C, a sharp weight loss starts to appear, indicating the decomposition of the Ce-MOF framework. In order to determine the successful synthesis of Ce-MOF as well as to further verify its thermal stability, powder X-ray diffraction tests were performed. As shown in Fig. 2b, the synthesized Ce-MOF was in general agreement with the simulated profiles. In addition, the structure of Ce-MOF remained essentially unchanged after calcination at 300°C for 4 h. Ce-MOF was then placed in different alcohol solvents and water at 100°C for seven days to demonstrate the hydrothermal stability of the material. As can be seen in Fig. 2c, the diffraction peaks of Ce-MOF after immersion in different solvents do not show obvious changes, indicating that Ce-MOF has good stability in water and organic solvents. 3.2 Catalytic oxidation performance of Ce-MOF and Ce-MOF-HCOOH MOF materials can be synthesized by oriented design with certain functions of catalysis due to their controllable structures. Among them, defective MOFs materials have attracted attention due to their abilities to expand the specific surface areas of MOFs to expose more active sites on the basis of their stabilized structures [33]. We used the oxidation of HMF as a probe reaction to investigate the application of defect-treated Ce-MOF as a catalyst. First, defective Ce-MOF-HCOOH materials were synthesized using formic acid (HCOOH) as the defective ligand. In this case, H2QS bound to the Ce binuclear cluster can be partially replaced by HCOOH, resulting in missing-linker defects in the formed structure [34]. As shown in Fig. 3 a, XRD tests were carried out after the addition of formic acid to introduce the defects, and the characteristic diffractions of Ce-MOF-HCOOH were similar to those of the original Ce-MOF structure, indicating that the crystal phase structure was preserved after the introduction of the defects. In the FTIR spectra of Fig. 3b, 1573 cm-1 is attributed to the skeletal vibration of the quinoline ring; 1499 cm-1, 1459 cm-1, 1382 cm-1, and 1316 cm-1 are assigned to the telescopic vibrations of C-C and C-N bonds on the quinoline ring; 1206 cm-1, 1146 cm-1, and 1043 cm-1 are classified as the -SO3 vibrations; 690 cm-1 and 601 cm-1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the S-O bond. In addition, a low-intensity band of Ce-O stretching vibration can be observed near 500 cm-1 [35,36]. The above characteristic bands are still present in the infrared spectra after the defect treatment is performed, and no significant changes are observed; proving the structural stability of this Ce-MOF from this point of view. All of the Ce-MOF materials exhibit type IV adsorption isotherms as shown in Fig. 3c, and there is an obvious hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesoporous structure. After the introduction of defects in Ce-MOF-HCOOH, unsaturated coordination sites appeared, and its specific surface area has increased to a certain extent, with the specific surface area reaching 122.01 m2 g-1, and the pore volume and pore diameter have also increased. The larger specific surface area will expose more active sites, which will be more favorable to the catalytic process [36]. The surface composition was analyzed using XPS to investigate the effect of defect introduction. In the Ce 3d spectra (Fig. 3d), the peaks labeled v, v'', v''', u, u'' and u''' belong to Ce4+, while ν' and u' belong to Ce3+. Among them, Ce-MOF-HCOOH has higher Ce3+ concentration (Table 1). In general, more Ce3+ produces more oxygen vacancy OV [37], consistent with the analytical results in O 1s. The relative contents of OV in Ce-MOF and Ce-MOF-HCOOH were further analyzed based on the O 1s spectra. It is shown in Fig. 3e that the three peaks appearing in the O 1s spectra belonging to lattice oxygen OL, defective OV and adsorbed oxygen Oads, respectively. Consistent with the expected results, the content of OV gradually increased from 46.31% in Ce-MOF to 57.14% in Ce-MOF-HCOOH. Ce-MOF and Ce-MOF-HCOOH were used in the reaction of HMF oxidation to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), respectively. With the same reaction conditions, Ce-MOF catalyzed the oxidation of HMF with 18.0% conversion and 99.9% selectivity of FDCA in Fig. 3f. After the introduction of some defects, the conversion of HMF over Ce-MOF-HCOOH also reached 63.5% and the selectivity for FDCA was 95.6%. It is shown that the increase of oxygen vacancies after the defect treatment has a significant effect on the catalytic oxidation capacity, because oxygen vacancies can preferentially adsorb the -CHO functional group [38,39], and also have prominent adsorption and activation capacity for oxygen molecules [40], which is conducive to promoting the HMF oxidation reaction. In addition, acidic sites (Ce ions) can form an adsorption of -CH2-OH to HMF [41]. Thus, the oxidation reaction consists of a synergistic action of oxygen vacancies and acidic sites [42,43]. It also proves that Ce-MOF possesses a relatively stable structure, reflecting the potential of Ce-MOF applications. The cyclic catalysis of Ce-MOF and Ce-MOF-HCOOH was then investigated (Fig. S1a-b). The results showed that the conversion of HMF and the selectivity of FDCA remained almost unchanged, demonstrating the good stability of Ce-MOF-HCOOH. The used catalysts were characterized by XRD and FT-IR (Fig. 3a-b). The comparison with fresh catalysts showed that there was no significant difference, reflecting that stable structure is the basis for application potential of Ce-MOF. 3.3 Catalytic performance of Pd/Ce-MOF in water and organic alcohols In recent years, MOFs have been used as platform for integrating functional substances such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). MOFs can enhance the dispersion of NPs, the interaction between the platform and noble metal, to form MOF-based hybrids with excellent physicochemical properties [44]. Therefore, we used the prepared Ce-MOF as a carrier platform and loaded the noble metal Pd to obtain Pd/Ce-MOF catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin. Firstly, the crystal structures of the prepared materials were characterized by XRD. Fig. 4 a shows that Ce-MOF did not affect the integrity of the Ce-MOF crystal structure after the deposition of metal Pd using water as a solvent, indicating the high stability of the Ce-MOF structure. Among them, no obvious Pd-related diffraction peaks were observed due to the low content or highly dispersed Pd. There is a consistent morphology of the material before and after Pd loading in TEM (Fig. S3a-b), further proving the stability of Ce-MOF. In the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 4b), the band near 1647 cm-1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the C=C bond of the quinoline ring, which is reduced after loading of the metal, probably due to the interaction between the large π-bond on the quinoline ring and the Pd nanoparticle in the Ce-MOF. The band at 1566 cm-1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the C=N bond of the quinoline ring, which has also been reduced. The band at 1566 cm-1 attributed to the stretching vibration of the C=N bond on the quinoline ring is also reduced. The possible reason is that the electron-rich C=N group in Ce-MOF interacts with Pd through π-π bonding. The band near 1040 cm-1 corresponds to the vibration of the -SO3 group, and in addition, the vibration attributed to S-O (595 cm-1) is also reduced accordingly. All the above observed changes indicate that there are interactions between the Pd species anchored on the carrier and Ce-MOF. The surface elemental electronic structures of the catalysts were examined by XPS. In the fine spectra of S 2p (Fig. S2b) and N 1s (Fig. S2c), it can be seen that after loading of Pd, the binding energies of NQ and S 2p3/2 in Pd/Ce-MOF were shifted to high binding energies by 0.38 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively, whereas in Ce 3d, they were shifted to low binding energies by 0.22 eV. This result indicates that the successfully loaded Pd interacts with the Ce-MOF carrier, resulting in the change of binding energy between the components, which is consistent with the FT-IR results. In the fine spectra of Ce 3d (Fig. 4d), the peaks of v, v'', v''', u, u'' and u''' correspond to Ce4+, and v' and u' are attributed to Ce3+, and based on the fitting results, the proportions of Ce3+ in Ce-MOF and Pd/Ce-MOF were calculated to be 12.98% and 23.38%, respectively. Pd/Ce-MOF has higher Ce3+ concentration, indicating that Pd/Ce-MOF has more Lewis acid sites [36,45]. Furthermore, it has been reported in the literature that the higher Ce3+ content, the higher oxygen vacancy content. The peaks located in the range of 527-536 eV are attributed to lattice oxygen OL, defect oxygen OV, and adsorbed oxygen Oads, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4e. Defect oxygen in Pd/Ce-MOF reaches 59.17%, which is higher than that of the defect oxygen concentration in Ce-MOF. The presence of defective oxygen facilitates the promotion of nucleation and stabilization of deposited metal nanoparticles [46,47]. Additionally, oxygen vacancies can promote the activation of hydrogen [48]as well as the adsorption of oxygen atoms on the carbonyl group [46], positively facilitating the process of hydrodeoxygenation reaction. The differences in the structural characteristics of the materials were analyzed by comparing the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions (Fig. 4c and Table 2 ). In Table 2, the specific surface area of Ce-MOF was 96.43 m2 g-1, and the high surface area carrier was favorable for the high dispersion of metal nanoparticles. After Pd loading, the specific surface area of the Pd/Ce-MOF samples decreased to 53.44 m2 g-1 and the pore volume also decreased from 0.081 cm3 g-1 to 0.062 cm3 g-1, indicating that loaded Pd nanoparticles would occupy a certain amount of the pore space. From the XPS full spectrum (Fig. S2a), it was observed that characteristic peaks attributed to Pd 3d appeared after loading of Pd, and the results of the fitting in the Pd 3d spectrum in Pd/Ce-MOF (Fig. 4f) corresponded to the metals Pd0 and Pd2+, respectively, in which the presence of Pd0 indicated that some Pd were reduced, and it contributed to the enhancement of activation capacity for H2. From the EDS elemental mapping (Fig. 4g and Fig. S3c), it can be seen that the components of C, N, O, S, Ce and Pd are uniformly distributed in the structure, confirming the successful loading of metal Pd. Solvents play an important role in non-homogeneous catalysis in the liquid phase. Generally, water of nontoxicity and sustainability is an ideal solvent in catalysis. However, organic solvents also have significant effects on the mass transfer and surface chemistry of catalysts in biomass conversion reactions. Hence, the performance of Pd/Ce-MOF catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin in water and different organic alcohols was investigated. The main product of all catalysts was 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP). As illustrated in Fig. 5 a, the solvent had a significant effect on the catalytic selectivity. In the blank test, there was almost no conversion of vanillin in the absence of catalyst. In alcoholic solvents, complete conversion of vanillin was obtained in all of them. This can be attributed to the fact that the hydroxyl group in alcohols has a lone pair of electrons that can form a hydrogen bond with the substrate, which can facilitate hydrogen migration and promote the HDO process [47,49]. With the carbon number decreasing, the by-products of the etherification of vanillin with n-butanol, isopropanol and ethanol decreased and the selectivity of MMP increased. When methanol was used as the solvent, the vanillin was completely converted with 99.9% selectivity for MMP. As we know, vanillin and vanillol have poor solubility in water compared to in alcohol solvents [50,51]. However, in the present work, vanillin was also obtained in water with up to 99.9% MMP yield. This indicates that Pd/Ce-MOF can be used as a good catalyst for hydrogenation in water and alcohols. In addition, the catalytic ability of the catalysts was further investigated by increasing the reaction substrate concentration (Fig.S4). When the reactant concentration was increased from 1 mmol to 2 mmol with other reaction conditions remaining unchanged, the yield decreased from 99.9% to 87.7%. When increased to 4 mmol, a yield of 60.3% was still achieved. This further proves that the catalyst has a relatively excellent catalytic ability. The adsorption and activation capacities of the catalyst Pd/Ce-MOF obtained on loading Pd onto Ce-MOF as a carrier were probed for hydrogen and substrate using DFT calculations (Fig. 5b-e). The activated H-H bond length at the Pd site was 0.847 Å, and 0.853 Å was obtained after loading Pd onto Ce-MOF, which are both larger than 0.751 Å for the free H2 molecule. The adsorption capacity for hydrogen was also increased from -0.566 eV to -0.639 eV for the hybrids. This indicates that Pd/Ce-MOF has a stronger adsorption and activation capacity for H2. As shown in Fig. 5d-e, the C=O bond length in vanillin is 1.222 Å, while the C=O adsorbed on the independent Pd site as well as on the Pd site in the Pd/Ce-MOF are both activated to grow to 1.256 Å and 1.271 Å, and the activation ability of Pd/Ce-MOF is greater. Moreover, comparing the adsorption energies of the two for vanillin, it can be seen that the adsorption energy of vanillin on Pd/Ce-MOF (-1.006 eV) was higher than that of the independent Pd site (-0.832 eV), proving that the Pd/Ce-MOF could better adsorb and activate the vanillin. The adsorption and activation capacities of hydrogen and vanillin were both improved in the Pd/Ce-MOF, which indicated that the combination of Pd and Ce-MOF could help to promote the vanillin. Also the defect sites can form adsorption and activation effects on C=O of vanillin and C-OH of vanillyl alcohol [52]. Thus, the synergistic interaction between the highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles and the defect sites of Pd/Ce-MOF is an important determinant of the efficient catalytic HDO behaviour [53,54]. After obtaining superior catalytic results under the condition of methanol as the solvent, a cycling test was then performed to illustrate the reusability of the catalyst. After five cycles (Fig. 5b), the vanillin conversion decreased only slightly and the MMP selectivity was maintained. XRD and TEM tests were carried out on the catalysts after cycling, and it was observed that the structure of Pd/Ce-MOF remained intact (Fig. S2d), and TEM (Fig. S3d) also exhibited the same morphology as before cycling, both proving that the synthesized Pd/Ce-MOF had a high stability. 4 Conclusion The design and synthesis of highly stabilized MOFs is still a popular research topic and is widely used in the field of catalysis. In this work, a highly stable metal-organic framework of Ce-MOF with Ce as a nine-coordination mode was synthesized using rare earth Ce as a metal center and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid as an organic ligand. The experimental results showed that the defect treated Ce-MOF-COOH remained intact, and the ability in terms of catalyzing the oxidation performance of HMF was 3.3 times higher than that of Ce-MOF. In addition, Pd/Ce-MOF catalyst was prepared by loading metal Pd into the carrier of Ce-MOF, and achieved an excellent 99.9% yield in the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction of vanillin in water. At the same time, it has outstanding reusability. This work develops a highly stabilized rare earth MOF material that can serve as an excellent platform for catalytic applications. This is of great significance for the application of stabilized MOF materials in catalytic conversion. Supporting Information Ce-MOF and Ce-MOF-HCOOH catalyzed HMF oxidation cycle experiments.

        "dc:description": "The unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), including structural tunability and high specific surface area, are promising for catalytic applications. However, the problem of poor stability limits the development of MOFs catalysts. In this study, a highly stable Ce-MOF was synthesized by combining rare earth Ce with high coordination number and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. The results show that Ce-MOF has good stability in water and alcohol solutions. Moreover, the Ce-MOF-HCOOH after defect treatment still has excellent stability. When used as a catalyst for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), the catalytic yield of Ce-MOF-HCOOH is 3.3 times that of Ce-MOF. Furthermore, Ce-MOF was used as a highly stable carrier loaded with metal Pd to prepare Pd/Ce-MOF catalysts. Excellent yields of 99.9% were achieved for the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin not only in methanol but also in water. Meanwhile, the good stability of Pd/Ce-MOF resulted in excellent reusability. This work developed a highly stable rare-earth MOF materials that not only improve the catalytic performance by defect treatment, but also serve as an excellent carrier for metal catalysts.",
