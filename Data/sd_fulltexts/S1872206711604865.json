This materialâ€™s intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogenation may be enhanced by transforming the crystalline Niâ€�based alloy into an amorphous structure via meltâ€�quenching. The metaâ€�stability and low specific surface area of such amorphous alloys, however, can severely restrict their catalytic applications. Our work has demonstrated that the incorporation of rare earth (RE) elements increases the crysâ€� tallization temperature of an amorphous Ni catalyst by 200 K. Related experimentation has deterâ€� mined that the specific surface area of such catalysts is dramatically increased by two orders of magnitude following alloying with Al and subsequent caustic leaching. In addition, by introducing a third metal as a promoter, the hydrogenation selectivity, corrosion resistance and magnetism of these materials may be precisely adjusted, giving rise to a family of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts, to which we apply the trade name SRNA. Among these catalysts, the SRNAâ€�1 catalyst is used for the hydrogenation of pharmaceutical intermediates, SRNAâ€�2 is employed for the hydroâ€� genation of glucose into sorbitol, SRNAâ€�3 is effective in the adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline and diesel and SRNAâ€�4 is used for the purification of caprolactam. In addition, the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst is useful in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid as a partial substitute for the costly Pd/C catalyst, reâ€� ducing consumption of the latter during the hydrogenation process by almost 50%.

Keywords: Amorphous alloy Skeletal nickel Hydrogenation Desulfurization Industrialization Â The Raney Ni catalyst, developed by Murray Raney in 1925, is currently very commonly employed as a hydrogenation catâ€� alyst in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and petrochemical industries and has reached a level of significant technical maâ€� turity [1]. Thus, to achieve further significant improvements in the area of catalytic materials, great strides in catalytic perforâ€� mance are required, along with the development of associated advanced reaction engineering techniques suitable for use with new catalytic materials. Amorphous metal alloys are a relatively new catalytic mateâ€� rial which have structures with shortâ€�range order but longâ€�range disorder and which exhibit useful catalytic properâ€� ties. Since the pioneering paper on the catalytic performance of amorphous metal alloys appeared in 1981 [2], these materials have remained some of the most heavily researched catalysts. Although the intrinsic catalytic activity of amorphous metal alloys is usually higher than that of the corresponding crystalâ€� line metals, their metaâ€�stability and low specific surface area have severely restricted their practical applications. To date, except that our research group has been successful in demonâ€� strating the manufacture and application of various amorphous metal alloy catalysts on an industrial scale, most studies conâ€� cerning these materials have been restricted to the laboratory or pilotâ€�plant scale. * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 ZONG Baoning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34(2013) 828â€“837 1. Improvement of thermal stability of amorphous Niâ€�P alloys [3] 1.1. Thermal stability of amorphous Niâ€�P and Niâ€�REâ€�P alloys One shortcoming of amorphous alloys which limits their practical applications in catalysis is their metaâ€�stability. Howâ€� ever, if an alloyâ€™s crystallization temperature is sufficiently greater than the temperature of the reaction to which it is apâ€� plied, it is possible for the amorphous alloy to maintain its high catalytic activity over a suitably long lifetime, without loss of the alloyâ€™s amorphous structure. In the case of the amorphous Niâ€�P alloy, its crystallization temperature is 629 K. One goal of our work was to further improve the thermal stability of this material by incorporating the rare earth (RE) elements Ce, Y or Sm into the alloy. This approach was adopted because it is known that the presence of RE atoms with large radii can reâ€� tard the diffusion of Ni atoms, which is a prerequisite for the crystallization of the amorphous Niâ€�P alloy [4]. Amorphous Niâ€�P and Niâ€�REâ€�P (RE = Ce, Y, and Sm) alloys were prepared via a meltâ€�quenching technique, by which amorphous alloy ribbons 2 mm wide and 20 Î¼m thick were obtained. Chemical analysis of the resulting alloys found atomic ratios of Ni82.0P18.0, Ni82.0Ce0.31P17.7, Ni82.0Y0.25P17.7 and Ni82.0Sm0.15P17.8. Figure 1 shows the differential scanning caloâ€� rimetry (DSC) traces obtained for the Niâ€�P and Niâ€�REâ€�P alloys and the data derived from the figure are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that there was only one exothermic peak for the Niâ€�P alloy but three peaks for the REâ€�modified alloys, and that the initial crystallization temperature of the amorphous Niâ€�P alloy was 629 K, while those of the Niâ€�Ceâ€�P, Niâ€�Yâ€�P, and Niâ€�Smâ€�P alloys were 88, 82, and 71 K higher, respectively. Furâ€� thermore, the peak maxima for the main exothermic peaks of the Niâ€�Ceâ€�P, Niâ€�Yâ€�P, and Niâ€�Smâ€�P alloys were 795, 787, and 742 K, respectively, and the corresponding enthalpy changes of crystallization (ï�„H) were 2.10, 2.33, and 1.71 kJ/mol. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the addition of only a small amount of a RE element can lead to a remarkable inâ€� crease in the crystallization temperature of the Niâ€�P alloy. This technique thus provides a simple and practical means of imâ€� proving the thermal stability of the amorphous alloy, so as to avoid catalyst deactivation due to collapse of the amorphous structure. 1.2. The crystallization kinetics of amorphous Niâ€�P and Niâ€�REâ€�P alloys To gain a better understanding of the beneficial effects of RE elements on the thermal stability of the Niâ€�P alloy, the activaâ€� tion energy of crystallization (E a) was measured for different alloys, as a means to account for their differing thermal behavâ€� iors. To obtain these Ea values, a numbers of DSC curves were generated at different heating rates (Î²) and crystallization temperatures were recorded at the time at which the first forâ€� mation of microcrystallites was observed through Xâ€�ray difâ€� fraction (XRD). Based on a sampleâ€™s crystallization temperature (Tp) and Î², Ea was calculated according to the Kissinger equaâ€� tion, as follows: d(lnTp 2 /ï�¢)/d(1/Tp) = Ea/R Here, Ea represents the potential energy barrier between two different phases. The larger the value of Ea is, the more difficult is the transformation between the two phases.

It is evident that, following the incorporation of RE elements, the E a associated with the transformation between the amorphous phase and the crystalline phase was increased considerably, leading to imâ€� proved thermal stability of the REâ€�modified alloys. Based on the data in Table 1, Figure 2 presents a schematic illustration of the potential energy barriers during crystallization of the Niâ€�P and Niâ€�Ceâ€�P alloys (presented as a representative of the REâ€�modified alloys). It has been noted that E a correlates well with the apparent activation enthalpy for viscous flow, suggesting that viscosity is the rateâ€�determining factor during crystallization [5]. When incorporating Ce, Y or Sm into the Niâ€�P alloy, it is reasonable to anticipate that these large RE atoms will effectively slow the diffusion of Ni and P atoms during thermal treatment, thus improving the thermal stability of the alloy. 2. Preparation of a high surfaceâ€�area skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalyst [3,6] 2.1. Physicochemical properties of skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalyst Because of the extremely low specific surface area of asâ€�quenched amorphous Niâ€�P alloys (~0.1 m 2 /g), these alloys are usually treated with subsequent pulverization, oxidation or reduction to increase their specific surface area and thus imâ€� prove their catalytic activity. Such treated alloys, however, still exhibit a relatively low specific surface area of 2 m 2 /g, which is much smaller than that of either the Raney Ni catalyst or the supported Ni catalysts. As a result, the prospects for industrial application of amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalysts are currently limited and it would be highly beneficial to develop a simple, efficient method to increase the specific surface area of these alloys. Based on existing methods for the preparation of Raney Ni catalysts with a spongeâ€�like structure, we incorporated Al into the amorphous Niâ€�P alloy during the initial meltâ€�quenching process. The Al in the resulting ternary alloy was then leached out with an alkaline solution to generate a porous structure. The amorphous structures of the ternary Niâ€�Alâ€�P alloy and the resulting skeletal Niâ€�P alloy catalyst were confirmed by XRD. The results in Table 2 show that the specific surface area of the skeletal Niâ€�P alloy prepared in this manner increased dramatiâ€� cally to 106 m 2 /g (comparable with that of the Raney Ni cataâ€� lyst), verifying the utility of our preparation method. The active surface area as determined by H2 adsorption was 48.5 m 2 /g, which is slightly higher than that of the Raney Ni catalyst, inferâ€� ring that the catalytic activity of the skeletal Niâ€�P catalyst is potentially greater than that of the conventional Raney Ni cataâ€� lyst. 2.2. The hydrogenation activity of the skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalyst Table 3 compares the catalytic activities for the liquidâ€�phase hydrogenation of styrene between the skeletal Niâ€�P catalyst, the amorphous NiSmP catalyst treated under optimized oxidaâ€� tionâ€�reduction conditions (which exhibited the greatest activity among the Ce, Y, and Smâ€�modified alloys) and the Raney Ni catalyst. The reaction conditions under which catalysis was measured are also given in this table. The specific catalytic acâ€� tivity for each material is expressed as the ratio of the mass of styrene converted to ethyl benzene per hour to the mass of catalyst employed. It is evident that the weightâ€�normalized specific activity of the activated amorphous Niâ€�Smâ€�P catalyst is much lower than that of the Raney Ni catalyst, which we attribâ€� ute to the amorphous catalystâ€™s significantly lower specific surâ€� face area. The specific activity of the skeletal Niâ€�P alloy is simiâ€� lar to that of the Raney Ni catalyst at 353 and 363 K. At higher reaction temperatures, however, the skeletal Niâ€�P alloy is more active than the Raney Ni catalyst. Using the skeletal Niâ€�P at 383 K, all available styrene was converted to ethyl benzene and, in addition, 1.1% of the ethyl benzene was further hydrogenated to ethyl cyclohexane. Using the Raney Ni catalyst under the same conditions, unreacted styrene remained. Because the hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene proceeded readily over both catalysts, the liquidâ€�phase hydroâ€� genation of toluene to methyl cyclohexane was examined to further differentiate their catalytic activities. The reaction conâ€� ditions for these tests are given in Table 4. It was determined that, under these conditions, the catalytic activity of the skeletal Table 2 Physicochemical properties of the skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy cataâ€� lyst. Cited from Ref. [3].

ZONG Baoning et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34(2013) 828â€“837 Niâ€�P catalyst was more than twice that of the Raney Ni catalyst. A skeletal amorphous Niâ€�Laâ€�P alloy catalyst was subsequently prepared and its activity for the hydrogenation of toluene was also tested, with the results included in Table 4. The incorporaâ€� tion of La further improved the activity of the skeletal catalyst, possibly because of the improved thermal stability imparted by the La. From the above results, it is evident that this new method of preparing the catalysts, involving the incorporation and subâ€� sequent removal of Al, can remarkably increase both the speâ€� cific surface area and the catalytic activity of the amorphous alloy. Because no timeâ€�consuming oxidationâ€�reduction activaâ€� tion procedure was required, this preparation method works ideally to remove one of the main obstacles currently limiting the application of amorphous alloy catalysts in industry. 3. The catalytic activities of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts 3.1. Hydrogenation of organic compounds on SRNAâ€�1 and SRNAâ€�2 catalysts 3.1.1. Hydrogenation of pharmaceutical intermediates on the SRNAâ€�1 catalyst The trade name we have applied to the skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalyst is SRNAâ€�1. Table 5 shows the reaction condiâ€� tions and results for the liquidâ€�phase SRNAâ€�1 hydrogenation of five pharmaceutical intermediates containing several potential hydrogenation sites, including phenyl rings, C=C bonds, nitro groups and nitrile groups. The results show that the SRNAâ€�1 catalyst exhibited higher activity than the Raney Ni catalyst. Under the same reaction conditions, the consumption of the SRNAâ€�1 catalyst was 30% to 70% lower than that of the Raney Ni catalyst, showing that SRNAâ€�1 is also more costâ€�effective. As a result of this improved performance, the current demand for the SRNAâ€�1 catalyst for the hydrogenation of pharmaceutical intermediates is approximately 100 t annually. 3.1.2. Hydrogenation of glucose on the SRNAâ€�2 catalyst The trade name of our skeletal amorphous Niâ€�B alloy cataâ€� lyst is SRNAâ€�2. This catalyst was prepared in a manner similar to the skeletal amorphous Niâ€�P alloy catalyst, with the excepâ€� tion of the replacement of the metalloid P by the metalloid B. The data in Table 6 show that, compared with several commerâ€� cial Raney Ni catalysts, the use of the SRNAâ€�2 catalyst results in the complete conversion of glucose to sorbitol, while also alâ€� lowing the application of lower H2 pressure, shorter reaction time and a lower catalystâ€�toâ€�glucose ratio. The current demand for the SRNAâ€�2 catalyst for the hydrogenation of glucose is around 200 t annually, corresponding to a market share above 20%. 3.2. APR of ethylene glycol on the SRNAâ€�3 catalyst [7] H2 is considered to be a potential source of clean energy beâ€� cause its use does not emit greenhouse gases, either during direct combustion or during the operation of a H2 fuel cell. The current methods for the industrialâ€�scale production of H2 are primarily based on the use of nonâ€�renewable fossil fuels [8â€“11], and thus a process for obtaining H2 from renewable sources is highly desirable. Dumesic et al. [12,13] have demonstrated that H2 can be produced from sugars and sugar alcohols over either a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst or a Snâ€�modified Raney Ni catalyst at temâ€� peratures near 500 K in a singleâ€�reactor aqueous phase reâ€� forming (APR) process.

Comparison between the SRNAâ€�3 catalyst and Raney Ni SRNAâ€�3 is the trade name of a skeletal amorphous Ni cataâ€� lyst which has a lower atomic coordination number and a bulk composition with an atomic ratio of Ni84Al16. Because of the absence of a metalloid, the SRNAâ€�3 catalyst is partly crystalline. Table 7 compiles the H2 and alkane selectivities and gas and liquid product distributions at 498 and 538 K over the SRNAâ€�3 and Raney Ni catalysts [14]. SRNAâ€�3 exhibited comparable or lower H2 selectivity and higher alkane selectivity as compared with the Raney Ni catalyst. However, SRNAâ€�3 produced less CO in the effluent gas, which is especially significant when considâ€� ering applications in the field of H2 fuel cells, because the cell anode materials are usually vulnerable to CO poisoning [15]. 3.2.2. The promoting effect of Sn on the SRNAâ€�3 catalyst Figure 3 shows the trends in H2 and alkane selectivities as increasing amounts of Sn are incorporated into the SRNAâ€�3 catalyst. As can be seen, the selectivity of the catalyst for H2 increased when the Sn content was increased, with the H2 seâ€� lectivity exceeding 90% at Sn/Ni molar ratios above 4.4%. The alkane selectivity showed the opposite trend to that of H2. At a Sn/Ni ratio of 15.7%, the alkane selectivity was less than 1%, whereas the H2 selectivity reached as high as 98%. Kinetic data suggest that the addition of Sn not only decreases the turnover frequencies (TOF) for the alkanes, but also steadily increases the TOFs for H2 and CO2, thus leading to higher selectivity for H2. 3.3. Chemoselective hydrogenation of 2â€�ethylanthraquinone (eAQ) on the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst [16] The hydrogenation of eAQ is a key step in the industrial production of H2O2 [17]. As shown in Scheme 1, the hydrogenaâ€� tion produces 2â€�ethylanthrahydroquinone (eAQH2) and 2â€�ethyltetrahydroanthrahydroquinone (H4eAQH2), the â€œactive quinonesâ€� [18], which can then be oxidized to produce H2O2. Other more fully hydrogenated and hydrogenolysis products (degradation products) are not desirable, because they can neither produce H2O2 nor be regenerated, which leads to the loss of expensive eAQ. In industry, Pd catalysts are used in eAQ hydrogenation because of their high selectivity for active quiâ€� nones [17]. These Pd catalysts, however, are highly expensive. We therefore developed the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst for the chemoseâ€� lective hydrogenation of eAQ. SRNAâ€�5 is the trade name of a skeletal amorphous Ni catalyst promoted by Cr and Fe, with an atomic ratio of Ni74.6Fe2.4Cr4.3Al18.6. Figure 4(a) shows the percent yield of H2O2 as a function of time for both catalysts. Over the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst, the yield of H2O2 initially increases and then levels off, with X (X = n t H2O2/n 0 eAQ ï‚´ 100%, which also represents the selectivity for active quinones) plateauing at approximately 97%. In comparâ€� ison, the yield of H2O2 over Raney Ni reaches a maximum of only 67% and drops after prolonged reaction times. These reâ€� sults clearly demonstrate the higher selectivity of the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst in the hydrogenation of eAQ to active quinones, as Table 7 Comparison of the catalytic behaviors of SRNAâ€�3 catalyst and Raney Ni for APR of a 5 wt% ethylene glycol solution.

In order to gain further insight into variations in the selecâ€� tivity of these two catalysts, the outputs of both eAQ and H4eAQ were monitored and plotted in Fig. 4(b). It should be noted that the plotted values for eAQ in Fig. 4(b) denotes the sum total of unreacted eAQ and eAQ hydrogenated to eAQH2, while the valâ€� ues for H4eAQ equal the quantity of H4eAQH2, as can be seen by referencing the reductionâ€�oxidation cycles shown in Scheme 1. Using the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst, no H4eAQ was generated during the first 20 min, which is indicative of the catalystâ€™s high selectivity for eAQH2. In contrast, when using Raney Ni, H4eAQ was proâ€� duced as soon as the hydrogenation commenced. Based on gas chromatographyâ€�mass spectrometry (GCâ€�MS) analysis, H8eAQH2 was also immediately generated over Raney Ni. We can therefore conclude that the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst exhibits higher selectivity than Raney Ni for carbonyl group hydrogenation in the presence of an aromatic ring, thus leading to higher yields of H2O2 and lower consumption of H2 and expensive eAQ, which is highly preferred for an industrial process. 4. Adsorptive desulfurization of transportation fuels on skeletal amorphous Ni alloys Most transportation fuels currently in use contain 100 to 1000 Î¼g/g of organosulfur compounds. These Sâ€�containing molecules not only react with oxygen during combustion to produce the SO x species which lead to acid rain [19], but also act to poison catalytic converters and thus create additional pollutants as well [20,21]. The EU and United States have both announced plans to reduce the allowable S content in gasoline and diesel fuels to 10 Î¼g/g [22â€“24]. In addition, for fuel cells using gasoline as feedstock, a S content below 0.2 Î¼g/g is preâ€� ferred [25]. The desulfurization of transportation fuels by adâ€� sorption is a promising means to allow such fuels to meet these stringent environmental regulations [25â€“27]. Adsorptive desulfurization has the benefits of low investment cost and simple technology, minimal reduction in both the yield and octane number of gasoline, no consumption of H2 and no need for extreme reaction conditions such as high temperature and pressure. To date, however, the use of metallic adsorbents in this process has not attracted significant attention, even though Raney Ni has seen widespread use in the desulfurization of organic and organometallic compounds [28â€“30]. 4.1. In situ XPS study on the desulfurization of thiophene over SRNAâ€�3 [31] 4.1.1. Adsorption and dissociation of thiophene Following the addition of thiophene to SRNAâ€�3 at 103 K, the S 2p3/2 binding energy (BE) of physisorbed thiophene at 165.1 eV was identified during subsequent XPS analysis [32]. After heating to 173 K, about one half of the physisorbed thiophene was desorbed, although only about 17% of the thiophene reâ€� tained on the catalyst surface underwent sulfur abstraction, while the rest remained intact. Further annealing to 273 K inâ€� duced scission of the Câ€“S bonds of the residual thiophene and the surface concentration of atomic S reached a maximum and the formation of nickel sulfide commenced. At 473 K, there was only one doublet peak located between 160 and 165 eV, due to sulfur in the form of nickel sulfide [33,34]. The total sulfur inâ€� tensity remained constant from 173 to 473 K. On Raney Ni, thiophene in direct contact with the metallic Ni readily decomposes upon thermal annealing to give carbonaâ€� ceous species and atomic sulfur. The Câ€“S bonds of thiophene undergo scission at approximately 173 K on Raney Ni, close to the scission temperature of approximately 150 K observed on a Ni(111) surface [35]. It is consistent with experimental obserâ€� vations that the (111) diffraction peak is the dominant feature in the diffractogram of Raney Ni [36]. On the SRNAâ€�3 alloy, however, most chemisorbed thiophene remained intact at 173 K and did not dissociate until 273 K, a temperature significant higher than the dissociation temperatures observed on Ni sinâ€� gle crystals and Raney Ni. 4.1.2. Interpretation of differences in surface chemistry We determined that the unitâ€�cell dimension in SRNAâ€�3 alloy is 0.3548 nm, which is significantly larger than in either Raney Ni or crystalline Ni [36]. This difference in unit cells may be attributed to the effect of quenching, which may cause atoms in the Niâ€“Al alloy to deviate from their equilibrium positions. It is known that the dissociation of an activated molecule is generâ€� ally possible only when there is a good match between the inâ€� teratomic distances in the molecule and the atomic arrangeâ€� ment of the surface metal atoms [37]. The increased Niâ€“Ni disâ€� tance in the SRNAâ€�3 alloy may therefore not be conducive to the scission of Câ€“S bonds. The meltâ€�quenching technique thus presents new possibilities for the design of metallic adsorbents with tunable bonding strengths towards thiophene or thioâ€� phenic compounds.

The intact thiophene molecules can consequently be removed via supercritical CO2 extraction [38], thus simplifying the regenerâ€� ation of the Ni adsorbent. 4.2. Adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline and diesel [39,40] 4.2.1. Adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline Three different gasoline feedstocks were used in these studies. Feedâ€�1 was a fullâ€�range gasoline derived from fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC), with a density of 0.7200 g/cm 3 and a S content of 1800 Î¼g/g. Feedâ€�2 was a heavy fraction of hyâ€� droâ€�treated FCC gasoline, with a density of 0.7800 g/cm 3 and a S content of 335 Î¼g/g. Feedâ€�3 was a light fraction of FCC gasoâ€� line, with a density of 0.6600 g/cm 3 and a S content of 265 Î¼g/g. The S content in gasoline after adsorption by the SRNAâ€�3 alloy in a slurryâ€�bed reactor was measured by a microcouloâ€� metric technique. The results summarized in Table 8 show that the S content in the resulting product can be readily controlled by varying the adsorbent/gasoline ratio and the adsorption conditions. The S contents of Feedâ€�1 and Feedâ€�2 were deâ€� creased to below 500 Î¼g/g and 50 Î¼g/g, respectively, which would meet Chinese gasoline regulations. In the case of Feedâ€�3, when using 20 g of the SRNAâ€�3 alloy as the adsorbent at an adsorption temperature of 313 K and a residence time of 10 min, less than 1 Î¼g/g of S was left in the gasoline, demonstratâ€� ing that SRNAâ€�3 alloy is a promising adsorbent for the producâ€� tion Sâ€�free gasoline under mild adsorption conditions. 4.2.2. Adsorptive desulfurization of diesel Although adsorptive desulfurization over alloys is also apâ€� plicable to straightâ€�run diesel, FCC diesel or coker diesel, wherein the S content may range from 500 to 10000 Î¼g/g, conâ€� sidering that the majority of the organic sulfides in diesel (inâ€� cluding thiols, thioethers, and thiophenes) can be readily reâ€� moved by hydrodesulfurization (HDS), we used HDS diesel for adsorptive desulfurization testing, for economical and practical purposes. Heterocyclic sulfur compounds such as benzothioâ€� phenes, dibenzothiophenes, and their derivatives are difficult to remove by the conventional HDS process, and so we moniâ€� tored for these compounds using a gas chromatograph equipped with an atomic emission detector (GCâ€�AED). The dieâ€� sel sample had a density of 0.8400 g/cm 3 and a distillation range of 477â€“644 K. The S content in the diesel after adsorption in a slurryâ€�bed reactor was determined by GCâ€�AED and is given in Table 9. From these results, we see that higher adsorption temperatures produce lower S content following adsorption. 5. Examples of commercial applications of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts A 30 t per year prototype unit for the manufacture of SRNA catalysts was commissioned in 1993, with the aim of both imâ€� proving the production technology and reducing costs. The meltâ€�quenching method was used to manufacture amorphous alloys in this facility and specially designed equipment was required, since the liquid Niâ€�Al alloy is very viscous, has a high melting point and is susceptible to oxidation. This commercial demonstration unit was primarily used to optimize the design of the graphite crucible, graphite nozzles and copper roller used in the melt cooling process. A scaledâ€�up 100 t per year production facility for the manufacture of SRNA catalysts was constructed in 1995. A unique thermal treatment procedure was developed at that time which resulted in SRNA catalysts with improved amorphism and enhanced hydrogenation activâ€� ity. The process flow associated with the manufacture of SRNA catalysts in this facility incorporated the regeneration and utiâ€� lization of sodium metaâ€�aluminate by collecting the spent mother liquor and wash water to provide raw materials for the production of alumina or zeolite. This measure not only avoids environmental pollution, but also allows for the maximized utilization of aluminum feedstocks as well as reduction in the production costs of the SRNA catalysts. 5.1. The commercial application of SRNAâ€�4 in the purification of caprolactam [41] The postâ€�refining of caprolactam aims to saturate any unâ€� saturated impurities via hydrogenation, to differentiate their physical properties from those of caprolactam. The existing technology generally utilizes the Raney Ni catalyst in a hydroâ€� genation process consisting of a series of two 10 m 3 kettleâ€�type reactors operating at 0.7 MPa and 363 K. Impurities are satuâ€� rated through hydrogenation prior to being separated via disâ€� tillation, which ensures high quality in nylonâ€�6 made from the resulting caprolactam. The productâ€™s PM value is widely used as an indicator of the quality (that is, the impurity content) of the caprolactam such that the higher the PM value is, the lower the impurity content. The PM value of premiumâ€�quality caproâ€� lactam should be above 30000 s, although the value of caproâ€� lactam manufactured by existing technology is generally 20000 Table 8 Adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline by SRNAâ€�3 alloy.

Based on the distinct adâ€� vantages of the SRNAâ€�4 catalyst over the Raney Ni catalyst in bench and pilot tests, the catalyst was successfully substituted for Raney Ni catalyst in a commercial caprolactam production process in 1998. Upon the employment of the SRNAâ€�4 catalyst, the consumption of the catalyst was reduced from 0.21 to 0.18 kg/t, resulting in a total catalyst consumption decrease of 14%. The demand for SRNAâ€�4 catalyst for the purification of caproâ€� lactam is currently around 150 t annually, and its market share is above 80%. 5.2. CO methanation in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid [42] The synthetic process used commercially for the production of caprolactam from toluene, the SNIA Viscosa process, consists primarily of the oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid, the hyâ€� drogenation of benzoic acid to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (CCA) and the amidation of CCA to caprolactam. In this process, the hydrogenation of benzoic acid is carried out in a series of continuously stirred reactor tanks over a 5% Pd/C catalyst. This method, however, suffers from a number of shortcomings that lead to inefficient operation of the equipment and excesâ€� sive consumption of the expensive Pd/C catalyst. In addition, recycled Pd/C catalyst exhibits catalytic activity only 1/6 to 1/5 that of fresh catalyst. Among the factors contributing to the deactivation of the catalyst, CO released from the decarboxylaâ€� tion of CCA is regarded as the most important, because even a trace amount of CO is sufficient to deactivate Pd. Because the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst is effective in eliminating CO by methanation, and the presence of chromium in this catalyst can improve its acid resistance, we introduced its use into the industrial proâ€� cess for the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. Simultaneously, the design of the production equipment and flow process were also improved, because the use of SRNAâ€�5 introduced problems associated with recycling and separating the catalyst. 5.2.1. The promoting effect of SRNAâ€�5 catalyst in a conventional industrial unit Following the incorporation of SRNAâ€�5 into a conventional industrial process unit, the concentration of CO in the reaction system was reduced from approximately 300 Î¼g/g to about 100 Î¼g/g. Increasing the amount of SRNAâ€�5 also resulted in steady increases in the activity of the recycled Pd/C catalyst. As a result, the amount of CCA produced per kg Pd increased from 35 t using the recycled Pd/C catalyst alone to 50 t using a comâ€� bination of 0.8 wt% SRNAâ€�5 in conjunction with the recycled Pd/C. In addition, consumption of the fresh 5% Pd/C catalyst during sustained hydrogenation activity was reduced by 46%. 5.2.2. Modification of the conventional industrial process Because the centrifuge separator employed in the traditionâ€� al process was originally designed for the separation of the Pd/C catalyst, and because the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst has a much higher density, we found that the existing unit was not suffiâ€� cient to recycle SRNAâ€�5. As a result, there were several hundred Î¼g/g of Ni left in the spent Pd/C catalyst, which lengthened the incineration time required to treat the spent Pd/C catalyst to two weeks, greatly increasing the cost associated with keeping spare stock of fresh Pd/C catalyst on hand. Process improveâ€� ments were therefore necessary to solve the recycling and sepâ€� aration problems caused by the introduction of the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst. To fully utilize the beneficial effects of SRNAâ€�5 in this proâ€� cess, we modified the existing catalyst separation unit by inâ€� corporating a hydraulic cyclone after the hydrogenation reacâ€� tor and a novel magnetic separator after the evaporator. A schematic of the modified process for the hydrogenation of benzoic acid is presented in Fig. 5. In this modified process, the hydraulic cyclone recycles the majority of the SRNAâ€�5 as well as the spent Pd/C catalyst to tank VE203, which reduces the load on the centrifuge separator. When the hydraulic cyclone was first employed in the separation unit, the level of residual Ni in the spent Pd/C catalyst was reduced substantially, to 10% of its Hydraulic cyclone H 2 Benzoic acid H 2 H 2 H 2 recycle tank Separator tank R201~R204 reactor Fresh catalyst Exausted catalyst Recylce catalyst Magnetic separator Filter VE209 receiver CCA Centrifuge Recylce catalyst V E 2 0 3 F e e d t a n k V E 2 0 8 C C A r e c i e v e r P0221 P0205 Measuring pump R e c y l c e c a t a l y s t t a n k F r e s h c a t a l y s t t a n k E v a p o r a t o r Fig. 5.

The incineration time reâ€� quired to treat the spent Pd/C catalyst was accordingly shortâ€� ened to 7â€“8 d. Because the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst is ferromagnetic, while the Pd/C catalyst is not magnetizable, we designed a permanent magnetâ€�based separator operating in the magnetic condensaâ€� tion mode to further isolate the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst from the Pd/C catalyst. We found that the concentration of Ni remaining in the spent Pd/C catalyst after using this threeâ€�step separation strategy was only 1/4 to 1/3 of that which remained when using a combination of the hydraulic cyclone and the centrifuge separator. The incineration time for the spent Pd/C catalyst was further shortened to 4â€“5 d, which is close to that required without the addition of the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst. Moreover, because of the much more thorough recycling of the SRNAâ€�5 catalyst, the amount of CCA produced per kg Pd was increased by apâ€� proximately 20% as compared with using the centrifuge sepaâ€� rator alone. The consumption of fresh Pd/C catalyst was reâ€� duced by about 50%, while the purity of CCA was increased by 0.5%, demonstrating the superiority of the modified process for the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. Moreover, the modified industrial unit exhibited greater temperature and pressure stability, meaning that fewer ongoing adjustments of these parameters were required. Finally, the prolonged lifetime of the Pd/C catalyst allowed less frequent recovery of the spent Pd/C catalyst, thus improving the process efficiency. This imâ€� proved design concept and separation strategy may also preâ€� sent opportunities for the improvement of other industrial hydrogenation processes which may have issues with CO poiâ€� soning of catalysts. 6. Conclusions This paper presents an overview of our research efforts concerning the innovation of amorphous Ni alloy catalysts prepared by the meltâ€�quenching technique and related chemiâ€� cal engineering processes. The inherent disadvantages of amorphous alloy catalysts, in terms of small specific surface area and low thermal stability, have been successfully mitigatâ€� ed, which allows the possibility of developing these materials into practical catalysts with improved performance, as substiâ€� tutes for the Raney Ni catalyst. Based on these endeavors, we have achieved the first successful commercial applications of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts in the international arena. Our work to date has been primarily limited to the study of Niâ€�based amorphous alloy catalysts, and there are many potenâ€� tial applications for these catalysts which have not yet been fully explored. Further investigations may include the develâ€� opment of skeletal amorphous alloy catalysts based on other metals such as Co, Fe, Cu or Ru, which may find important apâ€� plications in selective hydrogenation, CO hydrogenation, amâ€� monia synthesis, biomass conversion, and other industrial processes. Nevertheless, our work forms a preliminary basis for the understanding of the physicochemical properties and catalytic behaviors of new skeletal amorphous alloy catalysts. We believe that more comprehensive and inâ€�depth investigaâ€� tions in this field will undoubtedly improve the practical appliâ€� cations and theoretical understanding of skeletal amorphous alloy catalysts, with significant benefits to the fine chemical and petrochemical industry.

Tel/Fax: +86-10-82368011 Raney Ni is one of the most widely used catalysts in the petrochemical industry. This material's intrinsic catalytic activity for hydrogenation may be enhanced by transforming the crystalline Ni-based alloy into an amorphous structure via melt-quenching. The meta-stability and low specific surface area of such amorphous alloys, however, can severely restrict their catalytic applications. Our work has demonstrated that the incorporation of rare earth (RE) elements increases the crystallization temperature of an amorphous Ni catalyst by 200 K. Related experimentation has determined that the specific surface area of such catalysts is dramatically increased by two orders of magnitude following alloying with Al and subsequent caustic leaching. In addition, by introducing a third metal as a promoter, the hydrogenation selectivity, corrosion resistance and magnetism of these materials may be precisely adjusted, giving rise to a family of skeletal amorphous Ni alloy catalysts, to which we apply the trade name SRNA. Among these catalysts, the SRNA-1 catalyst is used for the hydrogenation of pharmaceutical intermediates, SRNA-2 is employed for the hydrogenation of glucose into sorbitol, SRNA-3 is effective in the adsorptive desulfurization of gasoline and diesel and SRNA-4 is used for the purification of caprolactam. In addition, the SRNA-5 catalyst is useful in the hydrogenation of benzoic acid as a partial substitute for the costly Pd/C catalyst, reducing consumption of the latter during the hydrogenation process by almost 50%. 摘要 Raney Ni催化剂是石油化学工业用量最大的催化剂之一, 通过急冷技术将其晶态结构转变为非晶态结构, 能够提高加氢活性. 但非晶态合金热稳定性差、比表面积小限制了这类催化材料的工业应用. 通过加入少量稀土元素, 使非晶态 Ni 晶化温度提高200 K以上; 通过加入Al再碱抽Al, 使非晶态Ni比表面积增加100倍以上; 通过加入功能助剂调节非晶态Ni的加氢选择性、增加抗酸碱腐蚀性和磁性, 从而形成了系列非晶态Ni加氢催化剂 (商品名为 SRNA). 其中, SRNA-1 用于药物中间体加氢; SRNA-2用于葡萄糖加氢制山梨醇; SRNA-3用于汽、柴油吸附脱硫; SRNA-4用于己内酰胺加氢精制; SRNA-5 用于苯甲酸加氢中替代Pd/C催化剂, 使后者的用量减少了50%.
