Graphical abstract Hydrotalcite-like compounds are valuable anionic nanoclays due to their functionalized capacity. Rare earth elements, La and Ce, were incorporated in those materials by co-precipitation and wet impregnation methods. The materials were calcined and used as mixed oxides in the selective production of monoglycerides at 220 °C and with a glycerol/methyl stearate molar ratio of 6:1. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, surface area, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma − optical emission spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The product yield was determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. The catalyst structural surface properties and basicity were determined by the composition of the mixed oxides, as was revealed by the catalytic behavior of the materials. The sample with Ce incorporated by the impregnation method exhibited the highest basicity, which is probably related to the highest monoglyceride yield of 77%. Keywords Layered double hydroxides Lanthanum oxide Cerium oxide Glycerol valuation 1 Introduction Synthetic inorganic materials with well-defined pores and surfaces show suitable properties for solving today’s environmental and industrial problems. Among many lamellar solid types, the layered double hydroxides (LDH) arouse special interest since they are intercalation compounds with nanoscale periodicity and complete charge separation between the gallery ions and layers, which is a distinguishing feature of their structure [1,2]. LDH have received great attention because they result in excellent catalysts or catalyst supports due to their large surface areas, basic properties, high metal dispersion and good thermal transmission. These physicochemical properties depend on the type and proportion of cations incorporated, and calcination temperature [3]. LDH materials are a class of heterobimetallic systems described by the general formula [M2+ 1-x M3+ x(OH)2]x+·An− x/n·mH2O, where M2+ and M3+ are cations in the layers (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Al3+, Fe3+, etc.). The LDH positively charged sheets have a single-layer thickness of ∼0.48 nm and charge-balanced anions in the interlayer denoted by An−. There is no practical limitation to the nature of anions located in the interlayer. However, the thickness of the interlayer is determined by the number, size, orientation and strength of the bond between the anions and the hydroxyl groups of the brucite-like layers. The metallic ions that make up the layer should necessarily present octahedral coordination and preferentially, ionic radius within the range of 0.50 to 0.74 Å to form LDH. This variation promotes a different charge density in the layer, since the charge is generated from isomorphic substitution of M2+ by M3+ in the lamellar structure. In synthetic LDH, the x value (presented in the general formula) may vary from 0.10 ≤ x ≥ 0.33 and the M2+/M3+ ratio can vary from 2 to 4 [4,5]. When the metal ions in the structure are Mg and Al only, the compounds are named hydrotalcite (HT). These materials have been used either fresh or mainly after calcination, since the metal oxides obtained further increase the surface area, basic properties, and reveal the memory effect up to 450 °C calcination temperature. The memory effect is the skillful reconstruction capacity of the layer structure after exposure of the calcined LDH to water or aqueous solutions [6,7]. A great variety of LDH have been synthesized by different methods. The co-precipitation method, at constant pH, in a temperature range, is the most common procedure. On the other hand, the fact of supporting a metal on oxides allows controlling the acid/base properties of the supported phase. With this purpose, the wet impregnation method tends to favor the incorporation of a third metal on the structural system Mg/Al-CO3. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, many reactions occur due to the acid/basic properties of the catalyst surface. The characterization of acid sites has been widely studied. In contrast, the notion of basicity has been less well studied perhaps due to the limited use of solid bases in the industry [8], although interest in solid bases has been growing since the 1970s [3]. The LDH have found widespread applications in fluorescence materials [9,10], bionanotechnology [11], as a fire retardant additive [12], etc. Moreover, the extensive use of fossil fuels has generated environmental issues, such as global warming and atmospheric pollution [13]. The replacement of fossil fuels by renewable biofuels is a necessity. The employment of biofuels from biological feedstocks is a significant option because they can be generated sustainably from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water [14]. Biodiesel is one of the most promoted biofuels in the world due to the widespread use of the internal combustion engine and its capacity for being mixed at any level with petroleum diesel to create mixtures, usually called B20 or B5. Among the disadvantages of biodiesel production are the low petroleum barrel prices, which reduces the biodiesel production cost advantage (no competitive cost) and the food security policies that disregard integrated food-biofuel policies to boost biofuel production. Despite such drawbacks, worldwide biodiesel production from vegetable oils is constantly growing [15]. Consequently, large amounts of exceeding glycerol as biodiesel by-product promote the generation of new ways of revalorizing this renewable feedstock. The industrial process generally involves homogeneous acid or basic catalysts, leading to a mixture of mono-, di-, and triesters, and molecular distillation is necessary to obtain high-purity products. Moreover, the use of homogeneous catalysts leads to the formation of a high amount of salts. Furthermore, these catalysts favor side reactions leading to the degradation of fatty oils. It is, therefore, the driving force towards eco-friendly processes that has drawn attention to heterogeneous catalysis. Different solid base catalysts for heterogeneously and selectively produced monoglycerides have been increasingly studied as the preferred transesterification method, since it is environmentally friendly and product separation is much easier [16,17]. Alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides have been extensively tested as catalytically active phases for heterogeneous transesterification [18–21]. Lanthanides are less frequently studied but no less efficient in improving catalyst performance [22]. The yield and selectivity in the synthesis of monoglycerides and diglycerides are a starting point in the development of new food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and industrial products [23]. Commercially, the methods for obtaining monoglycerides and diglycerides start from the glycerolysis reaction between a vegetable oil or methyl ester and glycerol, using temperatures between 220 and 260 °C, together with high agitation rates and the addition of catalysts such as NaOH, KOH, or Ca(OH)2 [24], without achieving significant selectivity towards any of the final products. Between 15 and 20 catalysts are known to produce glycerides [25–29]. The enzymatic systems have proved to be very effective and selective towards monoglyceride production, but so far without any success on an industrial scale [30,31]. Barrault et al. showed that basic solids such as MgO, CeO2 and La2O3 in addition to MgO present catalytic activity for methyl oleate with glycerol transesterification [32]. In these investigations, it has also been possible to demonstrate a small degree of selectivity towards monoglycerides, very similar to that obtained with some homogeneous basic catalysts [33]. The HT and LDH catalysts, both in their calcined and hydrated forms [23,34–36], have demonstrated a good performance for the development of transesterification reactions. In the current development framework, it has been proposed that the value added of glycerol be increased through the transesterification reaction to obtain fine chemicals as a way to address the environmental problems. The aim of this work is to improve the monoglyceride yield in the transesterification reaction with glycerol through the catalytic evaluation of mixed oxides of La or Ce derived from anionic nanoclays. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Synthesis Two synthesis methods, co-precipitation and wet impregnation, were applied in order to compare the viability of a third ion (La or Ce) incorporation in the LDH structure. The direct co-precipitation method consisted of a low supersaturation method at constant pH (10 ± 0.2). The material was prepared with a constant ( M g 2 + ( A l 3 + + M 3 + ) ) molar ratio of 3, where M3+ represents La or Ce. Two solutions were prepared. One of them containing Mg(NO3)2.6H2O, Al(NO3)3.9H2O and the third metal salt, La(NO3)3.6H2O or Ce(NO3)3.6H2O, dissolved together in distilled water. The other solution, 0.085 M of Na2CO3, was the source of carbonate ions. Both solutions were dropped simultaneously into 50 mL of distilled water at 60 mL h−1. The pH was kept constant by adding a 2 M NaOH solution. The co-precipitation was carried out at room temperature, and the gel was magnetically stirred continuously. The mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 4 h. The precipitate was aged in the mother liquor overnight, and then it was washed with distilled water and separated by centrifugation at 2800 rpm until pH = 7. The resulting material was dried overnight at 90 °C. Finally, the solid was calcined in open air at 450 °C for 9 h [36] and named MMO. The first step of the wet impregnation method required the synthesis of the matrix, which had Mg as a divalent positive ion and Al as a trivalent one, by the co-precipitation method. The precursor obtained by the above-described protocol was hydrotalcite. When this hydrotalcite was calcined, the Mg-Al oxide matrix was achieved (MgAlc). The second stage of the method consisted of the incorporation of La or Ce in the matrix by wet impregnation according to the procedure reported by Balsamo et al. [37,38]. The impregnation protocol started with the mixture of the matrix and 45 mL of a solution containing the La or Ce salt to achieve a theoretical load of 10% w/w. The remaining liquid was evaporated in vacuum, and the samples were dried at 90 °C for 12 h. The impregnated samples were calcined in a tubular reactor at 350 °C for 2 h and then at 500 °C for 8 h at constant air flow with the purpose of increasing the surface areas [39]. The synthesis methods and parameters of the samples are summarizing in Table 1 . The samples were named including the third metal ion incorporated and the synthesis method employed, for example, Cei (for impregnation method) and Cec (for co-precipitation method). The catalyst with the best performance was tested through two cycles and named Cei_R1 and Cei_R2. 2.2 Characterization All samples were examined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) on a Philips PW 3838 diffractometer, using monochromatic Cu K radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at a scan rate of 1/3 min at 2θ in a range between 10° and 80°. The specific surface areas (SSA) were measured using a Micromeritics Pulse Chemisorb 2700 instrument by single point at P/P0 = 0.3 through the BET method. The precursors were degassed at 200 °C and the calcined materials at 390 °C, both for 50 min. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MMO were obtained with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV using a JEOL JSM-6380 LV and a Supra 40 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The specimens were Au coated (sputtering) to make them conductive. The MMO chemical composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma − optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The equipment was a VARIAN VISTA-MPX CCD Simultaneous ICP-OES. The catalyst basic properties were measured by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with CO2 as probe molecule. Typically, about 100 mg of the sample is placed in a quartz reactor and pretreated in argon at 100 °C for 60 min prior to the adsorption of CO2 at the same temperature. After the adsorption of carbon dioxide (3 wt% CO2 in He; 20 cm3 min−1), the catalyst was treated with a flow of helium (20 cm3 min−1) for 45 min at 100 °C in order to remove physically adsorbed CO2. The CO2 TPD was measured by heating the sample from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The CO2 uptake was determined by integrating the detected peaks using the software of the equipment previously calibrated with different amounts of Na2CO3. The desorbed CO2 was analyzed and quantified by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-14 A) equipped with a TCD. 2.3 Catalytic test In the reaction studied, the products were mainly identified as mono- and diglyceryl stearate (MG and DG) and exceptionally as triglyceryl stearate (TG). Methanol was also identified as a by-product, which was continuously evacuated and recovered by condensation. The transesterification reactions were performed as reported in a previous article [37]. The reactor was operated in a batch regime for the solid and liquid phases with a N2 flow (35 mL min−1) to remove methanol and to provide an inert atmosphere to avoid degradation of reactants and products. First, the reactants, glycerol (Cicarelli, 99%) and methyl stearate (Aldrich, >96%), were heated until the reaction temperature (220 °C) in a silicone bath and under stirring (500 rpm). Then, the catalyst (4 wt%) in powder form was added [40]. The stoichiometry of the synthesis reaction of monoglycerides requires a molar ratio of glycerol/stearate = 1 to produce one mole of MG. However, from the thermodynamic point of view, the MG yield can be increased by an increase in the glycerol/methyl stearate molar ratio to values greater than the stoichiometric ratio. That is, an excess of glycerol would shift the equilibrium of the reaction to the right, increasing the conversion of methyl stearate. Thus, the glycerol/methyl stearate molar ratio of 6:1 was used. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) after silylation to improve compound detectability. A proper and unique combination of silylating agents for the trimethylsilylation of the free hydroxyl groups of glycerol, mono- and diglycerides, was used as well as the internal standard tricaprin. The agents N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-acetamide (BSA, Fluka, >95%) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS, Fluka, >98%) were used following the derivatization method described by Ferretti et al. [40]. Quantification was carried out using the standards 1-stearoyl-rac-glycerol (Sigma, >99% GC), glyceryl 1,3-distearate (Sigma, >99% GC) and glyceryl tristearate (Sigma, ≥99% GC). Silylated samples of products and reactants with a known amount of tricaprin (glyceryl tridecanoate >99% GC Sigma) added as an internal standard were analyzed by gas chromatography using a Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column (ZB-5HT Inferno TM, 15 m length × 0.53 mm i.d.) and a flame ionization detector. Conversion and selectivity were expressed in molar percentage, and the yield was calculated as their product. The methyl stearate molar conversion was defined as the ratio of the moles consumed to the initial theoretical moles expressed as a percentage. The turnover number (TON) was defined as moles of methyl stearate converted/mole of Ce or La. The relative uncertainties of the measurements were tested with repeated determinations. The percent relative uncertainty (CV (%)) of the result was calculated by dividing the corresponding absolute uncertainty by the average of the measurements. In order to analyze the evolution of the reaction with time and the catalyst stability with the reuse, the material with the best catalytic results was evaluated at different reaction times (2, 4 and 6 h, respectively) and in the second cycle. The necessary conditioning steps in order to reuse the catalyst included the Soxhlet extraction with n-hexane, drying at 90 °C and recalcination in a tubular reactor at 350 °C for 2 h and then at 500 °C for 8 h at constant air flow. 3 Results and discussion For the physicochemical characterizations, two main properties were considered, the synthesis method and the third metal incorporation in the structure, both focused on the catalytic evaluation of glycerol valuation. 3.1 Characterization of materials 3.1.1 XRD of precursors and mixed oxides Fig. 1 shows LDH patterns of the materials with La or Ce incorporated. The Lac diffraction pattern indicates that other La phases, La2CO3(OH)2, La(OH)3 and La2CO5, precipitate together with their possible incorporation in the lamellar structure [41,42]. The matrix with impregnated La (Lai) presented the typical hydrotalcite structure and showed no sharp and wide peaks. The diffraction patterns of the LDH with Ce incorporated presented the characteristic structure of the hydrotalcite phase (PCPDFWIN 70-2151) in spite of the third metal incorporation. The LDH sample, Cec, showed the sharp and symmetrical peaks typical of a layer structure for planes (003), (006), (110) and (113) and asymmetric peak widths for planes (012), (015) and (018). This result was less evident in the impregnated samples (Cei and Lai), unsharpened and wide peaks were observed. The presence of CeCO3OH and CeO2 [43] phases would be attributed to incomplete incorporation of the Ce metal ion in the layer structure. Comparing the materials obtained by the impregnation method, Lai and Cei diffraction patterns showed a partial recovery of the layer structure. The peaks corresponding to the reflection planes characteristic of the hydrotalcite phase showed low intensity and significant widening, especially in the sample with La incorporated. The presence of segregated phases observed in the XRD patterns of LDH could be due to the bigger ion radius of La and Ce than that of Al. Table 2 lists the cell parameters for LDH. They were calculated by reflections of planes (003) and (110), using the equations c = 3 x d003 and a = 2 x d110, where \"c\" indicates the basal spacing and \"a\" is the average of the distance between metal ions of the laminar structure. No significant differences in the parameter \"a\" were observed, which would indicate the partial isomorphic substitution of the Al3+ ions by La3+ or Ce3+. The parameter \"c\" showed that the interlayer distance (d003) decreased slightly from co-precipitated samples to impregnated ones. This would be attributed to an asymmetry in the stacking of the layers, due to the differences in electronegativity and ion radius size of Ce and La [42,43]. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of MMO with the third incorporated metal synthesized by both methods, and the matrix MgAlc synthesized by the co-precipitation method. In all cases, MgO was detected in the periclase phase (PCPDFWIN 78-0430). In addition, the phases of the oxides of the incorporated metals, CeO2 (PCPDFWIN 81-0792) and La2O3 (PCPDFWIN 83-1355), were distinguished. All of the segregated phases detected in the XRD patterns of LDH samples were converted to metal oxides by thermal treatment. 3.1.2 SSA and chemical composition Table 3 summarizes the values of SSA and chemical compositions determined by ICP analysis for the set of MMO. The M g 2 + ( A l 3 + + M 3 + ) molar ratios are below the theoretical values (in parentheses in the table); nevertheless, they remain close to them. The experimental molar percentages of Mg and Al calculated by ICP remained relatively constant, indicating that the molar ratio was directly affected by the third metal content. The M+3 molar percentages were considerably below the theoretical values (in parentheses in the table), except for sample Lai that showed a higher experimental value. The incorporation of the third metal by co-precipitation method was lower than expected, due to the Ce and La ionic radius nearly duplicate the preferentially ones within the range of 0.50 to 0.74 Å to form LDH [5]. In all the cases, the MMO areas were greater than those corresponding of their precursors. This phenomenon was attributed to the destruction of the brucite-type layer together with the elimination of the carbonate ions and the water from the interlayer space. The carbonate ions were released as carbon dioxide, promoting the formation of small channels and pores in the solid, which increased the surface area [37]. The increment of SSA for the samples Lac and Cec was 50% and ˜80% respectively. These values were close to those reported in the bibliography [44–46]. In this regard, the samples Lai and Cei show the biggest increase in their respective SSA values when they are calcined (seven and forth times higher). This fact is assigned to the calcination process in air flow that considerably increases the SSA value [37]. 3.1.3 Studies by SEM Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs of mixed oxides with Ce and La incorporated. The samples Cei and Cec exhibit rosette-like particles and structures with small crystalline domains (Fig. 3 A and B). However, the micrographs of the samples Lai and Lac show plate-like particles and the formation of bigger and more amorphous structures than the Ce mixed oxides (Fig. 3C and D) [43]. The increase in the percentage of Ce affects the morphological structure of the sample, as shown in Fig. 5B. In general, the tendency was at a higher load of the third metal and the co-precipitation method, less homogeneous morphology of the samples (Lac and Cec). Also, the dispersion of metals on the surface was assessed by elemental maps based on similar SEM micrographs. Fig. 3E and F shows images corresponding to the mixed oxides with Ce incorporated. Sample Cec (Fig. 3F) exhibits a regular metal distribution, while the Cei show high Ce concentration areas (Fig. 3E). This fact would be assigned to the different synthesis method. 3.1.4 Basic sites The temperature-programmed desorption technique using the CO2 probe molecule has been applied in many cases to determine the density and strength of the basic centers in mixed oxides derived from hydrotalcite [47–52]. According to how the CO2 molecule is adsorbed on the solid, three forms of basicity have been identified. As was reported by León [53], the formation of different species stems from the presence of sites with different basic strength in the CO2 adsorption and desorption process: bicarbonates (OH−, weak basic sites), bidentate carbonates (bridging, Mm+–O2− pairs, medium-strength basic sites) or unidentates (O2−, strong basic sites). Associating these types of species with the CO2 desorption temperature reveals: (i) a low temperature peak, with a maximum of desorption between 100 and 210 °C, attributed to the interaction with sites having weak basic strength. (ii) A desorption peak with a maximum between 250 and 300 °C, related to desorption of CO2 from medium-strength basic sites. (iii) A broad desorption peak at 450 °C that it attributed to CO2 desorption from sites with strong basicity. The basic site zones delimited by the different temperature ranges are indicated in Fig. 4 with dotted lines. The calculated values of the different basic densities are listed in Table 4 . In the basicity analysis, differences were mainly detected by the synthesis method rather than by the type of third metal incorporated. The samples synthesized by co-precipitation technique, presented very low basic site densities similarly as it was detected in the sample of the MMO (Mg-Al) unsubstituted by a third metal, agreeing with the La or Ce loads reported. On the other wise, the basicity results reported by Bancquart et al., respects to the La2O3 and CeO2 oxides were higher than the results reported here [22]. But their catalytic results reported were not better than reported in this work. This is could be attributed to the low specific surface area for those pure oxides. The oxides synthesized by the impregnation method presented the highest density of total basic sites. This would be attributed to the presence of the third metal on the surface of the materials. All the samples synthesized by the co-precipitation technique presented very low basic sites densities, which would be in agreement with the low La or Ce loads reported. However, the samples with La synthesized by impregnation presented a density value of strong basic sites higher than those modified with Ce, where the density of medium strength basic sites is markedly higher [41]. 3.1.5 Catalytic activity Table 5 shows the results of conversion, selectivity, yield in molar percentage and TON presented by mixed metal oxides with the third metal incorporated. It could be appreciated that the catalysts obtained by the impregnation method did not produce glyceryl tristearate (TG). The mixed metal oxide with Ce incorporated by the impregnation method presented the highest conversion, together with the highest yield to glyceryl monostearate (83%). These yields are higher than those obtained via the homogeneously catalyzed process (36%), as well as those obtained by Bancquart et al. [22] using La2O3 (27%) and CeO2 (4%). On the other hand, with 95% conversion, the selectivity to monoglyceride was higher than that obtained using homogeneous basic catalysts (40%). The catalytic evaluation results were related to the basic properties of the catalyst. It is highlighted that the sample Cei presented the highest density of total basic sites and the highest medium basic site density, according to the highest Ce content. This would indicate that the reaction takes place mainly through medium basic sites, in agreement with observations previously reported [37]. A similar behavior was observed for Lai together with an increase in the selectivity to diglycerides (36%). This behavior would be attributed to the greater density of strong sites. Furthermore, the turnover numbers (moles of methyl stearate converted/mole of Ce or La) are also given in Table 4. As can be observed, the stearate conversion values decreased with the increase of the third metal ion content, reported by ICP. They decreased markedly with increasing metal content, which would conﬁrm that a high charge did not effectively increase the catalytic transesterification. The highest stearate conversion was observed when the third metal content was the lowest one (reported by ICP). This fact was in agreement with the regular dispersion of the third metal on the MMO surface observed by elemental maps. Table 5 also lists the evolution of the reaction at 2 and 4 h for the Cei sample. Stearate conversion improved with reaction time and MG selectivity as well, because the reaction occurs stepwise in a series of two steps represented by two successive equations with different reaction rates, as Corma et al. proposed [47]. Comparing Cei_R1 and Cei_R2 reaction results, the catalytic activity continues after the second use, reaching a value of 93%. In addition, to verify the heterogeneity of the reaction, the content of cerium in solution was determined by ICP at the end of each catalytic cycle. The concentration of leached cerium was lower than 0.1 mg/L, which indicates that the catalyst was stable during the reaction and could be reused two times without a significant decrease in its activity [54]. The material stability was observed because the results of the catalytic activity in the second cycle of the reaction were close to the results obtained in the first cycle. In addition, the low leaching value showed the constant chemical composition of ceria in the material. 3.1.6 Cei MMO properties after the catalytic test The XRD patterns of the Cei sample fresh and used twice are shown in Fig. 5. The intensity and the crystalline order of the CeO2 phase decreased after each reuse and mainly after the second one. This is probably attributed to the necessary conditioning steps for the catalyst reuse. Despite the observed changes in the crystal structure, no appreciable decrease in catalytic activity was observed. This would represent that the crystalline structure is not a relevant property in the catalytic activity of the material during two reaction cycles. Regarding the carbonaceous compound deposition on the catalyst surface, although a probably amount of carbon species deposited on the Cei would be possible; the catalyst did not show any relevant decrease in catalytic activity. The most plausible explanation for the effectiveness of the catalyst lies in the carbonaceous deposits were removed after calcination process. This was close to those reported in the bibliography [54,55]. The Ce 3d XPS spectra of the sample Cei before and after being used twice in the reaction are shown in Fig. 6 . The complex spectrum was deconvoluted into 10 components; the assignments are shown in Fig. 6. The two sets of spin-orbital multiplets corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are labeled u and v respectively [56]. Due to the high non-stoichiometric nature of CeO2, the coexistence of different final states was observed [57,58]. The Ce3+ (red curves) and Ce4+ (green curves) are present in the fresh sample Cei and in the used samples Cei_R1 and Cei_R2. The peak at 917 eV BE (v4) is a clear indicator for Ce4+ because it does not superimpose with any Ce3+ line. 4 Conclusions Both synthesis methods allowed the incorporation of La or Ce in spite of the different sizes of ionic radius in relation to those of Mg and Al ions. Although there was a partial incorporation of the rare earth metal ions in the LDH structure, the presence of their segregated phases was evidenced by XRD. Because the purpose of the material design was to use it after thermal decomposition as metal oxide catalyst, its dispersion over the matrix of Mg and Al was allowed. The thermal decomposition of LDH generated the formation of MgO in periclase phase, together with oxides of the incorporated transition metals. The specific surface areas of the mixed metal oxides were greater than that of LDH in all samples. The mixed metal oxides obtained by both methods had irregular particle size and singular shape. The experimental composition values given by ICP were lower than the synthesis values except in the sample with Lai in which they were higher. All the oxides showed basic properties. However, in the samples obtained by co-precipitation the density of total basic sites was the lowest. In the impregnated samples a higher density of medium and strong sites was observed. The MMO Cei showed the highest yield towards the production of monoglycerides, attributed to the higher density of medium basic sites. TON values decreased markedly with increasing metal content, which would conﬁrm that a high charge did not effectively increase the catalytic transesterification. Therefore, the high activity and efﬁciency presented by the material with the lowest metal loading would account for the dispersive role of the nanolayered double hydroxide with respect to the active sites. The used materials presented no significant leaching after both reuses (Cei_R1 and Cei_R2). This could be attributed to the synergistic function of the active sites corresponding to the MgO, Al2O3 and CeO2 oxides.

        "dc:description": "Hydrotalcite-like compounds are valuable anionic nanoclays due to their functionalized capacity. Rare earth elements, La and Ce, were incorporated in those materials by co-precipitation and wet impregnation methods. The materials were calcined and used as mixed oxides in the selective production of monoglycerides at 220 °C and with a glycerol/methyl stearate molar ratio of 6:1. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, surface area, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma − optical emission spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The product yield was determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. The catalyst structural surface properties and basicity were determined by the composition of the mixed oxides, as was revealed by the catalytic behavior of the materials. The sample with Ce incorporated by the impregnation method exhibited the highest basicity, which is probably related to the highest monoglyceride yield of 77%.",
