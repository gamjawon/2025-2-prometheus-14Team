Graphical abstract Transformations of the naturally occurring compound (+)-aromadendrene (1) were performed in the presence of the heteropoly acid catalyst H3PW12O40, a technologically efficient homogeneous catalyst, which, in principle, can be recovered from polar solutions by precipitation using a nonpolar solvent. In solutions of n-butanol and ethanol, there was the formation of (+)-ledene resulting from isomerization of the double bond in the carbon chain of the substrate and the ether produced by nucleophilic addition of the alcohol molecule to the exocyclic double bond of 1. In ethanol solution, in addition to formation of (+)-ledene and the ether product derived from ethanol, there was also the formation of a product formed by the addition of a water molecule to the (+)-aromadendrene double bond. The products, alone or mixed, presented pharmacological properties and have the potential for commercial application. The simple catalytic process developed in this work is a technologically attractive route, which employs a renewable substrate for the production of compounds with potential uses in the fine chemical industry. Keywords Terpenic compounds (+)-Aromadendrene Isomerization Functionalization Heteropoly acids Introduction Natural and synthetic terpenic compounds are important platform molecules used in different sectors of the fine chemical industry for the manufacture of products including fragrances and flavorings, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, among others [1,2]. Industrial uses for terpenic compounds can be increased by chemical transformations involving rearrangements of their carbon chain skeletons or the insertion of functional groups in their molecular structures. These modifications provide greater diversity of the organoleptic, pharmacological, and phytosanitary characteristics of terpenic compounds, consequently, increasing the range of possible commercial applications [3,4]. A great variety of chemical reactions can be used to diversify and enhance the properties of terpenic compounds. These reactions are energetically and technologically more attractive and can also provide environmental advantages when catalysts are used to perform them. Catalysts are widely used in reactions involving oxidation, hydroformylation, metathesis, cycloaddition, hydrogenation, isomerization, hydration, acetoxylation, among others [4–16]. Particularly reactions catalyzed by acid are an attractive tool that can be used to add value to terpenic compounds. However, most such processes require the use of large quantities of mineral acids, which are frequently discarded together with other industrial wastes of process. The use of conventional mineral acids can cause environmental problems associated with the treatment of industrial waste, as well as corrosion problems. As an alternative, the use of heteropoly acids in acid catalysis has emerged as an attractive option for the development of processes that are more environmentally friendly [4,17]. Heteropoly acids (HPAs) present high acid strength, compared to other acid catalysts, as well as low corrosivity and nontoxicity. They also don’t promote undesirable reactions, such as sulfonation, chlorination, and nitration, among others reactions, which are commonly associated with the use of traditional mineral acids [18]. The properties of HPAs, combined with the specificity of their catalytic action, provide them with unique performance in various classes of chemical reactions. Their use in functionalization, isomerization, and cycloaddition reactions of terpenes and derivatives has shown significant success and has enabled the synthesis of important products with potential uses in different industrial sectors [4,6,7,13–16,19,20]. The processes that have been developed using HPAs are mostly environmentally benign and enable products to be obtained with good yields and, in some cases, with high stereoselectivity [4,19,20]. Therefore, HPAs are technologically viable alternatives to the use of conventional acid catalysts, such as mineral acids, ion exchange resins, and zeolites, among others, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems [4,8,21]. An important point is that their use in homogeneous systems does not prevent their recovery and recycling. HPAs are highly soluble in polar solvents, but insoluble in nonpolar solvents such as hydrocarbons. Consequently, HPAs can be recovered from polar organic solutions by precipitation using a nonpolar solvent, without any requirement for neutralization [6,17,18,22]. Previous studies have described the successful use of catalysts based on heteropoly acids in the transformation of sesquiterpenes compounds and their corresponding oxides by acid catalysis [13,14,23]. The use of HPAs in oxidation reactions is also reported, including the oxidation of sequiterpenes [24–26]. The compound (+)-aromadendrene is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene belonging to the hydroazulene family and is the main constituent of the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus [27–30]. In the literature, there are described some chemical transformations of (+)-aromadendrene. Examples are its isomerization to (+)-ledene using K/Al2O3, at 100 °C, or to (-)-isoledene using KO t Bu in DMSO [28]. Superacids such as fluorosulfuric acid are used in the isomerization of (+)-aromadendrene at temperatures higher than 100 °C [31]. The functionalization of (+)-aromadendrene has also been described. Alcohols and ethers can be obtained using zeolites and formic acid [32]. The alcohols (-)-epiglobulol and (-)-globulol are produced by the treatment of (+)-aromadendrene with acids, using ethanol as nucleophile [33]. Enzymes have been used to obtain oxygenated compounds from this substrate [34]. The methods reported in the literature for the transformation of (+)-aromadendrene involve the use of harsh reaction conditions, large quantities of mineral acids relative to the reagent employed, and/or processes performed in multiple steps [27,31]. The process employing zeolites and formic acid for the isomerization and functionalization of (+)-aromadendrene, for example, requires a reaction time of 48−87 h and the use of stoichiometric quantities of the substrate and the acid component, so, it is not a true catalytic process [32]. Aiming to broaden the potential commercial applications of (+)-aromadendrene (1) by application of a catalytic process, we reported in this work, the use of the heteropoly acid H3PW12O40 (HPW), the strongest heteropoly acid in the Keggin series, which was as a homogeneous catalyst for the chemical transformation of 1. The reactions were performed using alcohols as solvents, resulting in the formation of products after functionalization and isomerization of the carbon chain of compound 1. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies reported previously in the literature concerning the use of heteropoly acids as acid catalysts in chemical transformations of (+)-aromadendrene. Experimental Reagents All the components of the catalytic system were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used as received. The compounds (+)-aromadendrene (97 % of purity), dodecane, monohydrated tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40.H2O) (HPW), monohydrated tungstosilicic acid (H4SiW12O40.H2O) (HSiW) and monohydrated phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40.H2O) (HPMo) were purchased from Aldrich. The alcohols n-butanol and ethanol were obtained from Synth. The chemical composition of the impurity present in (+)-aromadendrene (equivalent to 3%) includes a set of five major isomers. The amount of impurities present in the substrate does not influence the conversion calculations of 1 and the selectivity calculations for the obtained products. Catalytic reactions The reactions were performed in a 10 mL glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The solution (total volume of 5.00 mL) contained (0.50–1.00 mmol) of (+)-aromadendrene, (0.50 mmol, internal standard used in GC analysis) of dodecane, and (1.06–21.20 μmol) of HPW catalyst, in the specified solvent (n-butanol or ethanol). The mixture was vigorously agitated at the selected temperature (40−100 °C). After appropriate time intervals, the agitation was interrupted and a small amount of sample (5μL) was removed from the reactor for analysis. The analyses were performed by gas chromatography (GC), using a Shimadzu QP-2014 instrument equipped with a capillary column (Rtx®-Wax, 30 m x0.25 mm x0.25 μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Quantification of the converted substrate and determination of the selectivity for obtained products were calculated employed the areas of the GC peaks for the substrate, products, and internal standard. The mass balance difference obtained in this quantification was attributed to the formation of high boiling point products (oligomers) that were not detected in the GC analysis. Representative experiments were carried out in triplicate, in order to confirm the reproducibility of the results. The reaction products were identified by GC/MS analysis using a Shimadzu QP2010-PLUS instrument operated in electron impact mode at 70 eV.

Numbering of atoms according to the structure shown in Scheme 2. Compound 5 (product of hydration of (+)-aromadendrene) MS (70 eV, EI): m/z 222 (1%) [M+], 189 (10 %), 175 (8%), 161 (24 %), 147 (16 %), 135 (20 %), 121 (19 %), 109 (18 %), 107 (32 %), 99 (42 %), 95 (22 %), 93 (36 %), 81 (30 %), 71 (62 %), 67 (28 %), 65 (35 %), 55 (28 %), 43 (100 %), 41 (66 %). The data are in agreement with the mass fragmentations for compounds resulting from hydration of the exocyclic double bond of the (+)-aromadendrene molecule [36,37]. Results and discussion The transformations of (+)-aromadendrene (1) in the presence of the H3PW12O40 catalyst (HPW) were studied in solutions of n-butanol and ethanol (Scheme 1). The alcohols acted as solvents and nucleophiles for the functionalization of 1. Representative results of these studies are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . In control (blank) reactions carried out in n-butanol and ethanol solutions, without HPW, there was no significant transformation of 1. Substrate conversions of 2–5 %, with the formation of products not detectable by GC, were obtained in experiments performed at 100 °C (n-butanol solution) and 65 °C (ethanol solution). In n-butanol solution, no substrate conversion was observed at 60 and 70 °C, using a substantial amount of HPW (Table 1, experiments 1 and 2). However, significant transformations of compound 1 were observed at temperatures ≥ 80 °C. At 80 °C, the HPW catalyst presented high activity in the transformation of (+)-aromadendrene, with selectivity towards the formation of two main products: an isomer of the substrate (2) and an ether (3). Product 2, identified as (+)-ledene, resulted from isomerization of the double bond in the carbon chain of compound 1. Product 3, a novel compound not previously reported in the literature, is an ether resulting from nucleophilic addition of a molecule of n-butanol to the exocyclic double bond of 1. The potential applications of ethers derived from terpenes and sesquiterpenes have been widely discussed in the literature [1,4]. The highest total yield for 2 + 3 was near 65 %, with approximately 90 % conversion of 1, in the reactions performed at 80 °C. At this temperature, the use of a higher concentration of HPW resulted in complete conversion of the substrate, but led to significantly higher formation of undesirable products (comparing experiments 3 vs. 4). The formation of high boiling point products (oligomers) was due to subsequent reactions of the primary products initially formed, or to reactions between molecules of the substrate itself. The use of a higher reaction temperature (such as 100 °C) enabled attainment of satisfactory conversions of (+)-aromadendrene using lower concentrations of the HPW catalyst. Under the optimized conditions, there was lower formation of high boiling point compounds and a combined yield of around 70 % for the desired products 2 + 3 (Table 1, experiments 5 and 6). At this temperature, increase of the HPW concentration favored preferential formation of product 2 resulting from the isomerization of (+)-aromadendrene, relative to product 3 (Table 1, experiments 5–7). Once again, there was the formation of oligomers. However, the use of suitable reaction conditions suppressed the formation of these products (Table 1, experiments 5 and 8). With the aim of improving the efficiency of the catalyst in terms of TON (turnover number), an experiment was performed using twice the amount of substrate (Table 1, experiment 8). The substrate was added in two steps (each of 0.50 mmol), with monitoring of the system for 12 h, after each addition. Previous studies have found that the use of a high initial amount of substrate can favor the formation of undesirable oligomerization products [19,38]. The conversions and selectivities were similar for both steps of the experiment, resulting in a total yield of 2 + 3 close to 65 % and TON equivalent to 650. The TON values were calculated considering the number of mols of substrate converted per mol of HPW employed. Under the same reaction conditions, with the same total amount of protons, HPW presented higher catalytic activity and selectivity, compared to the conventional acid catalyst H2SO4 (Table 1, experiments 5 vs. 9). Given the promising results obtained using HPW for the catalytic transformation of (+)-aromadendrene in n-butanol solutions, further experiments were performed with ethanol as the solvent. From both technological and environmental perspectives, ethanol is a more attractive solvent. It has a fairly low boiling point, favoring its removal at the end of the process, during isolation of the reaction products. Ethanol can be produced from renewable sources and has an excellent sustainability score in current solvent selection guides. It is considered less toxic and is widely recommended as an environmentally benign green solvent [39]. In acid-catalyzed processes for the transformation of terpenic compounds, it is important to note that the use of the solvent avoids or minimizes oligomerization reactions between the reagent and/or product molecules. Therefore, it is important to investigate the adaptation of processes to use solvents that are more benign and less toxic. In ethanol solution, the transformation reaction of (+)-aromadendrene (1) occurred at temperatures ≥ 65 °C. Experiments performed at 40 °C and 55 °C showed no conversion of 1, after 6.0 h of reaction, in the presence of a substantial amount of HPW (Table 2, experiments 1 and 2). At 65 °C, the HPW catalyst was active for the transformation of 1 with selectivity towards the formation of three main products: the isomer of the substrate (2), an ether (4), and an alcohol (5). Product 2 was the compound identified as (+)-ledene, formed in both solvents n-butanol and ethanol. Products 4 (ether) and 5 (alcohol) resulted from the nucleophilic addition of ethanol and water molecules, respectively, to the exocyclic double bond of 1. All the compounds obtained in the catalytic transformation of (+)-aromadendrene promoted by HPW, in ethanol solution, have been reported in the literature and have important antifungal and antibacterial activities [27,37,40]. It should also be pointed out that the pharmacological properties of the compounds resulting from hydration of the exocyclic double bond of 1 are not restricted to a specific stereoisomer. Previous studies have attributed the fungicidal and bactericidal activities to the mixture of isomers resulting from the hydration of (+)-aromadendrene [41,42]. At 65 °C, there was the formation of products 3-5, with a combined yield of 75 %, and significant conversion of 1 (around 80 %). Different to the results for the reactions performed in n-butanol, the use (in ethanol) of a higher concentration of HPW favored conversion of the substrate, and not increase the formation of undesirable products (Table 2, experiments 4 vs. 5). On the other hand, in reactions performed at 65 °C, with ethanol as solvent (experiments 3–6), increase of the amount of catalyst favored formation of the isomerization product. These results indicated that the relation between increased formation of high boiling point products and a greater quantity of catalyst was associated with the use of higher reaction temperatures. An interesting feature was that for the reactions performed in ethanol, there was an alternation in the proportions of products formed (Table 2). At first, higher selectivity was observed towards compound 5 (experiments 4–6). However, during the course of the reaction, the selectivity towards 5 gradually decreased. The low stability of the alcohol 5 in the reaction medium could be explained by the possible occurrence of sequential reactions inherent to this class of chemical compounds present in an acid medium. These reactions can lead to increase of the carbon chain, forming high molecular weight compounds, or to the occurrence of dehydration reactions producing an alkene, such as (+)-ledene. The dehydration reaction of product 5, for producing (+)-aromadendrene, was discarded, because there was no increase above the initial concentration of the substrate. Both the oligomerization reaction and the alcohol dehydration reaction are catalyzed by acids. It is important to point out that water was not added to the reaction system, except when specified in the experiment. The amount of residual water present in the substrate and the commercial solvent (around 0.1 mmol in 5 mL) was sufficient for formation of the alcohol from (+)-aromadendrene. In an attempt to favor formation of the hydration product 5, an experiment was performed with the addition of water to the reaction medium. However, the addition of 1 equivalent of water, relative to the initial substrate concentration, drastically reduced the conversion of 1, with no formation of the products observed previously (Table 2, experiment 7). Once again, the HPW presented greater activity, compared to the H2SO4 catalyst, under the same reaction conditions and with same total number of mols of H+ (Table 2, experiments 5 vs. 8). In principle, the HPW can be recovered from the reaction medium by precipitation using nonpolar solvent as reported in the literature [6,17,18,22,43]. However, due to the small mass of catalyst commonly used in studies carried out on the laboratory scale, HPW recovery and reuse tests are not viable due to technical and laboratory limitations [6,22]. It should be noted that the reaction conditions employed in the studies carried out do not compromise the integrity of the chemical structure of the HPAs used, as well as their physical-chemical properties. Since the decomposition temperatures of the HPAs used in the process are higher than 300 °C [17,18,43–46] The performance of the commercial catalysts of H3PMo12O40 (HPMo) and H4SiW12O40 (HSiW) were evaluated under the best conditions developed for the transformation of (+)-aromadendrene in n-butanol and ethanol solutions using the H3PW12O40 (HPW) catalyst (Tables 1 and 2). Despite the greater acid strength attributed to HPW [17,18,43–46] the heteropoly acid HSiW showed a slightly better performance in terms of conversion initial speed of the substrate. However, HPW has a significantly lower commercial value (about 3.5 times less compared to HSiW [47,48]) and did not show a significant rise in terms of yield for the products of interest, at the end of the studies carried out. (Table 1: experiments 6 vs. 11 and Table 2: experiments 5 vs. 10). In this way, the use of HPW is more attractive for the developed process. A possible mechanism for the acid-catalyzed transformation of (+)-aromadendrene is shown in Scheme 3 . Protonation of the exocyclic double bond of 1 forms carbocation I, which undergoes rearrangement to form carbocation II. Product 2 can then be formed by deprotonation of carbocations I or II. Nucleophilic attack of the alcohol (n-butanol or ethanol) on carbocation I leads to the formation of compounds 3 and 4, respectively. The formation of product 5 can occur by nucleophilic attack of the water molecule on carbocation I. However, there is a delicate balance among the reactions in the proposed mechanism. For the system using ethanol as solvent, there was a substantial reduction in the selectivity towards product 5, together with a significant increase in selectivity towards product 2. This was indicative of dehydration of alcohol 5, as expected in an acid medium. Conclusions The strongest heteropoly acid of the Keggin series, H3PW12O40, was shown to be an effective catalyst for the transformation of (+)-aromadendrene, in the liquid phase. In n-butanol solution, the two main products were obtained, (+)-ledene and the ether resulting from functionalization of the double bond of (+)-aromadendrene, with a combined yield of 75 %. The ether obtained in n-butanol solution is a novel compound that has not been reported previously. In ethanol, which is an environmentally friendly solvent that can be obtained from biomass, in addition to the formation of (+)-ledene and the ether derived from ethanol, there was the formation of alcohol resulting from hydration of the substrate. In this system, the formation of the three main products gave a total yield of 70–75 %, under optimized conditions. The relatively low boiling points of n-butanol and ethanol enable their easy removal from the reaction medium by distillation. The products obtained have potential commercial applications, either alone or as mixtures. HPW presented higher activity and selectivity, compared to H2SO4. In principle, the HPW can be recycled. The ability to recover and recycle the HPW catalyst used from the reaction mixture is an important advantage of this simple, environmentally friendly and economically viable process.

        "dc:description": "Transformations of the naturally occurring compound (+)-aromadendrene (1) were performed in the presence of the heteropoly acid catalyst H3PW12O40, a technologically efficient homogeneous catalyst, which, in principle, can be recovered from polar solutions by precipitation using a nonpolar solvent. In solutions of n-butanol and ethanol, there was the formation of (+)-ledene resulting from isomerization of the double bond in the carbon chain of the substrate and the ether produced by nucleophilic addition of the alcohol molecule to the exocyclic double bond of 1. In ethanol solution, in addition to formation of (+)-ledene and the ether product derived from ethanol, there was also the formation of a product formed by the addition of a water molecule to the (+)-aromadendrene double bond. The products, alone or mixed, presented pharmacological properties and have the potential for commercial application. The simple catalytic process developed in this work is a technologically attractive route, which employs a renewable substrate for the production of compounds with potential uses in the fine chemical industry.",
