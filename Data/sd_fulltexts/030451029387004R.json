V.), Badhuisweg 3, 1031 CM, Amsterdam (Netherlands) (Received July 20, 1992; accepted March 2, 1993 ) Abstract The influence of the chain loading on the activity and complex formation of a copolymerbound rhodium hydroformylation catalyst in comparison with its low molecular weight analogue has been studied in detail. As polymer support a perfectly random copolymer of styrene and 2,2' bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)-p-styrylphosphite (2) was used. The chain loading, a, of this copolymer with phosphite ligands has a large influence on the complex formation of the catalyst. With high chain loadings moderately active bis-phosphite catalysts are formed. Low chain loadings give active, easily accessible, mono-phosphite complexes. Study of the copolymer-bound catalysts yielded mechanistic information about the catalytic species involved in the hydroformylation of styrene and cyclooctene. The active species in the hydroformylation of sterically hindered alkenes is a mono-phosphite rhodium complex. The activity of the catalyst can be enhanced if excess phosphite is used. This effect was ascribed to faster reaction with hydrogen of bis-phosphite rhodium intermediate (s). The activity of the copolymer-bound catalyst towards the hydroformylation of cyclooctene is found to be as high as the activity of its low molecular weight analogue. The hydroformylation of styrene proceeds more slowly. Key words: hydroformylation; phosphites; polymer-bound catalysts; rhodium Introduction The hydroformylation of sterically hindered alkenes using rhodium catalysts with bulky phosphites has been a field of interest during the past decade [ 1 ] . The activity and selectivity of bulky phosphite modified rhodium complexes towards terminal linear alkenes (i.e. 1-octene) are very high [ 2 ] . Recent studies [ 3 ] revealed that the active species in the hydroformylation reaction is a mono-phosphite rhodium complex (HRh(CO)3P) rather than a bisphos- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 18 T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 phite complex (HRh (CO) 2P2) . The major drawback of these catalytic systems for use in industrial processes is the high price of rhodium, and therefore, the need of a complete recovery of the catalyst after the reaction. Easy recoverability can be achieved by heterogenization of the homogeneous catalyst. Immobilization of the catalyst onto a rigid surface such as silica or metal oxides is one possible solution, but this procedure mostly reduces or eliminates the specific properties of the homogeneous catalyst. Binding of the catalyst to a soluble linear polymer retains its homogeneous character [ 4 ] . The advantages of using (soluble) (co)polymeric materials are that: (a) good control over carrier composition can be obtained, (b) standard (spectroscopic) techniques can be used to study the catalytic system, (c) diffusion limitation of the substrate does not occur, and (d) unlike surfaces of metal oxides, properly chosen polymers are nearly inert and are not expected to interfere in catalysis [ 5 ] . As outlined by Hardee et al. [6], the stability of a (co)polymer-bound catalyst is a function of at least three variables: (i) the thermal and mechanical stability of the polymer, (ii) the chemical stability of the link between the ligand and the backbone, (iii) and the stability of the metal-ligand bond. For use in hydroformylation reactions the thermal stability of (co)polymeric polystyrene-like resins will be (more than) sufficient since temperatures do not exceed ca. 100 C. To their disadvantage, strongly crosslinked (macroporous ) resins would pulverize in stirred reactors; if soluble (co )polymeric carriers are used, however, mechanical degradation does not play a role. The most often used ligand in polymer-bound rhodium hydroformylation catalysis so far, is triphenylphosphine or, more precisely, anchored derivatives of this ligand. Unfortunately, the phosphorus-carbon bond in these ligands is rather labile; it can be attacked by the metal center, resulting in a breakage of the phosphoruscarbon bond [ 7 ] . Furthermore, the free phosphines are easily oxidized by ingress of dioxygen or peroxides in the alkene feedstock. This will lead to depletion of the phosphine ligand, eventually resulting in leaching and/or deactivation of the catalyst. Aryl phosphites are less sensitive to oxidation and less prone to cleavage of the phosphorus-oxygen bond than aryl phosphines, and thus, perhaps unexpectedly, they are more stable ligands. Phosphites may undergo hydrolysis or alcoholysis reactions and reactions with aldehydes, but the bulky phosphites used here turned out to be very stable towards these reactions. The strength of the metal-phosphorus linkage is strongly influenced by the n-acidity of the ligand. The 7c-acidity of arylphosphites is much higher than that of arylphosphines (xpph3=13cm-1,XPCOPh>3=27cm-') [8],making phosphites the more strongly bound ligands. Thus, metal elution from an ary1phosphite modified carrier due to ligand exchange reactions, is less likely to occur than from its phosphine counterpart [ 9 ] . These properties, combined with the high activity of arylphosphite containing rhodium catalysts in hydroformylation reactions, make (co)polymer-bound arylphosphite rhodium catalysts interesting candidates for application in industrial processes. The separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture in possible, although not as T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 19 (co)polymer backbone catalytic centre Fig. 1. Schematic presentation of a copolymer-bound catalyst, grafted from a silica surface. easy as it is with insoluble particles. This problem can be overcome by grafting the polymer from a silica surface (Fig. 1). These silica-grafted (co)polymerbound catalysts are under study, and results will be reported in the next paper. For practical reasons however it is more convenient to study the catalytic system in its soluble form. If copolymer-supported ligands are used, the properties of the catalyst can be tuned by changing the loading of the copolymer [ 10 ] . Low chain loadings lead to site isolation whilst high chain loadings force the catalytic centers into constant proximity to each other [ 11 ] . These effects can be used to influence the complex formation of the metal center. The possibility to change the catalytic complex, without changing the ligand or the conditions (temperature, solvent, pressure etc. ), provides a tool to study the catalytic cycle in detail. Experimental Synthesis of the phosphite ligand and catalyst precursor 2,2' -Bis(4,6-di-t-butyl)phenol A 2 g amount of CUC12 - 21120 and 2 ml of TMEDA were added to a solution of 500 g 2,4-di-t-butylphenol in 11 methanol. The reaction mixture was stirred under pure oxygen at room temperature for 4 days. The white precipitate was filtered and washed with cold (0 C) dry methanol. The pure product was dried at 50 C under vacuum.

A 50 g (105 mmol) amount of 2,2' -bis (4,6-di-t-butyl )phenyl chloro phosphite was dissolved in 200 ml freshly distilled THF and heated at 50 C, and 1.1 equivalent of lithium phenolate in THF was added dropwise. After addition of the phenolate, the reaction mixture was refluged for 2 h. The THF was removed by evaporation and n-hexane was added.

Mot Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 21 Kinetic measurements Kinetic experiments were carried out in a stainless steel (AISI 316) autoclave of 100 ml at constant CO and HZ pressure and at constant temperature. For a standard experiment the reaction vessel was charged with 20 ml of toluene, 0.2 ml of substrate (styrene or cyclooctene), 0.1 ml of decane (internal standard for GLC analysis) and the desired amount of catalyst (1-7.5 mg Rh (COD) acac and 10-350 mg (polymer-bound) phosphite). Prior to adding the alkene, the reaction mixture was heated under N2 atmosphere to the desired temperature. During the reaction samples were drawn and analyzed on a Packard 419 GLC apparatus equipped with a SE-30 column. The calculation of the activity of polymer-bound as well as low molecular weight rhodium complexes is based upon the total amount of rhodium per unit of volume. Inactivation of complexes (e.g. due to dimerization etc.) is not taken into account. As was reported before [ 4 ] , the enhanced rhodium concentration within the polymer coils does not influence the observed value of the activity of all the complexes. Spectroscopic measurements High pressure infrared measurements For high pressure infrared measurements under oxo-conditions a 50 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a Morgan 55-DS plunger pump with TR-2 timing relay and a high pressure infrared cell with CaF2 window (cutoff below 1000 cm-1) was used. The apparatus can be heated and is thermostated. The pressure was registered with a mechanical manometer. Spectra were collected on a Bruker IFS88 infrared spectrometer. For a standard experiment the autoclave is charged with 20 ml of solvent (toluene), pressurized with the desired gas mixture and heated. The IR spectrum was recorded. The apparatus was then depressurized, the phosphite added, the system pressurized and the IR spectrum recorded. Using the same routine, the rhodium (COD) acac complex is added. Then the IR spectra were recorded every two minutes. By using the solvent and phosphite spectra as references, spectra of only the rhodium complex (es) are obtained. Spectra collected at various times can be used to make plots of absorption against time. NMR measurements A sapphire NMR tube with titanium tap was used for high pressure NMR experiments. Spectra were recorded on a Varian VXR-300 NMR apparatus. Before measurement, the catalytic species were permitted to form for 30 minutes at 80 C at 20 bar CO/H2 pressure. Toluene-d8 and acetone -d6 were used as solvent. No alkene was added. If the experiments were carried out with acetone-d6 as solvent, the rhodium hydride complexes remained stable in a H2/ CO atmosphere at 1 bar. Low pressure NMR experiments were carried out in normal glass NMR tubes.

Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 Simulations Model energy minimization calculations (Fig. 3) were carried out using the program BIOGRAF (BIOGRAF, Biodesign Corporation, Pasadena, CA). First a conformational search over the torsional gauche and trans angles of the polymer backbone was carried out. The conformation of the phosphite ligands was derived from the X-ray structure of the bisphosphite rhodium pentadionato complex (4) and kept constant during this conformational search. Conformations selected from this search were energy minimized using the Dreiding I force field of the BIOGRAF package. The most plausible conformation was used to calculate the energy increase when the phosphite ligands were forced towards each other. A rhodium dummy was used to simulate the change in energy when different P-Rh-P angle constraints were applied. The NMR simulations were carried out using the MS-DOS program gerrnlR (geNIVIR, NMR simulation program, version 3.1, copyright 1987-1990, IvorySoft, Amsterdam). The program iterates raw spectroscopic data, without the need to assign (all the) peaks. A spin system is used as input, then the program varies coupling constants, shifts and line widths of this system, till the simulated and experimental spectra match. Several spin systems were used as input, but only the combination of an ABX and a C,'X spin system (Table 1) yielded an acceptable match with the experimental spectrum (Fig. 4) . Results NMR and IR spectroscopy of the low molecular weight analogue In addition to the copolymeric ligand, the low molecular weight analogue has been studied. To this end we synthesized 2,2'-bis(4,6-di-t-butyl)phenyl phenyl phosphite (1) . Rhodium complexes formed under oxo-conditions were studied with high pressure infrared and NMR techniques. At atmospheric pressure spectra were recorded under NZ as well as H2/CO gas. The experiments were carried out in toluene at 80 C at a ligand to rhodium ratio of 10. O (1> @P O Low pressure At atmospheric HZ/CO pressure a carbonyl vibration at 2009 cm-1 is found in the IR spectrum. The 31P NMR spectrum shows a doublet at 126.9 ppm, Jp.,-p= 289 Hz under these conditions. The 1H NMR shows two distinct peaks for the methyl groups of the 2,4-pentadionate at 8=1.40 and 1.53 ppm. No hydride peaks are found. If rhodium cyclooctadiene 2,4-pentadionate T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol.

These crystals were isolated and examined with NMR spectroscopy. \"C NMR (APT [14] ), CDC13: 830.8 (CH3, acac), 31.4 and 31.7 (2CH3, t-butyl), 34.5 and 35.5 (2C, t-butyl), 100.0 (CH, acac), 122.9-126.6 (5CH, phenyl), 121.8 and 128.0 (2CH, bisphenyl), 131.2, 132.3, 145.3 and 146.9 (4C, bisphenyl), 140.6 (C, phenyl), 185.0 (C=O, acac). 31P NMR, CDC13: 8132.1 (d, JRh-p=304 Hz). 1H NMR, CDC13: 81.04,1.31,1.38 and 1.71 (4X 18H, t-butyl), 1.92 (6H, methyl), 5.41 (1H, acac ), 6.4-7.6 (18H, aromatic). High pressure A 31P NMR spectrum of a solution of Rh (COD) acac and 1 in toluene-d8 recorded under hydroformylation conditions (p (H2/CO) = 20 bar, P/Rh=10, T=80 C) yields a double doublet at 148.4 ppm, JRh-p = 243 Hz, JP_H = 3 Hz. The 1H NMR spectrum of this mixture shows a quartet at -10.4 ppm with JH-Rh=3 Hz and JH_p=3 Hz. The 2D 1 3Rh-1H correlated NMR spectrum (Fig. 2) shows a triplet, indicating that two phosphite groups are coordinated to the rhodium hydride.

On cooling the solution to -60 C the spectrum resolves into two sets of three lines (Fig. 4). The 1H NMR spectrum revealed three unresolved peaks in the hydride region. With a NMR simulation program using Binach-Hagele iteration, a successful simulation of the experimental spectrum was achieved. The peaks can be ascribed to two distinct rhodium hydride complexes. The first complex has an ABX spin system, the second a C,,X spin system where n is probably 3. Shifts and coupling constants are listed in Table 1.

The IR spectrum of the copolymer-bound complex has peaks at 2064, 2020 and 1976 cm-1. When the experiment is repeated under D2/CO atmosphere only two peaks are present in the carbonyl stretching region of the IR spectrum at 2047 and 1997 cm-1, indicating that one of the three absorptions is a rhodium-hydride vibration. 2-CH- - -co- -CHZ-CH- 0 1-a ( P a Copolymers with low chain loadings (a< 0.1), high pressure (area 1, Fig. 5) Copolymer-bound complexes with a chain loading, a, of 0.04 only show a broad band between 152 and 140 ppm in the 31P NMR spectrum. The integration, although not very accurate, shows that approximately 1.2 equivalent phosphite groups are bound to rhodium. The IR spectrum shows three peaks at 2076, 2009 and 1991 cm-1 with shoulders at 2064, 2020 and 1974 cm-1. Repeating the experiment under D2/CO instead of HZ/CO atmosphere does not alter the position or intensity of the main peaks in the spectrum. When a copolymer with a chain loading, a, of 0.08 is used in an identical experiment, absorptions are found at the same wavelengths. The relative intensity of the peaks, however, is changed. The increased intensity of the peak at 2076 cm-1 compared to the peak at 1991 cm-1, proves that these peaks belong to two T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 27 distinct complexes. When the HZ pressure is raised to 30 bar (p (CO/H2) -40 bar) the intensity of the peak at 2076 cm-' decreases while the absorption at 1991 cm-'increases. Kinetics The hydroformylation reaction (with copolymer-bound as well as low molecular weight catalysts) shows pseudo first order dependence of the alkene (styrene and cyclooctene) concentrations. Thus, the rate of the reaction can be expressed by a first order rate constant k (s-'). To relate this reaction parameter to the amount of rhodium used, k was divided by the rhodium concentration yielding kobB (1/mol s). The reaction also shows first order dependence towards the rhodium concentration (when [Rh] < 2 mmol/1). The low molecular weight analogue The activity of the catalyst towards the hydroformylation of cyclooctene was measured as a function of the phosphite to rhodium ratio (P/Rh) (Fig. 6) . If the phosphite concentration is increased, the activity of the catalyst increases. The activity of the catalyst towards the hydroformylation of styrene was determined at L/Rh=5. The rate constant kabe of this reaction is much higher than that of cyclooctene, viz., 7.01/mol s. 0.20 o.oo 10 20 30 Fig. 6. koe, as a function of the phosphate to rhodium ratio.

Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 The copolymer bound catalysts The rate constant kob. as a function of the chain loading, a, was determined for both the hydroformylation of cyclooctene and styrene. The results are presented in Fig. 5. The activity with cyclooctene as a substrate is very low for copolymer-bound catalysts with high chain loadings (area 3) . The highest reaction rates are achieved with copolymer-bound catalysts with low chain loadings (area 1) .The highest activities for the polymeric system are measured at a ligand to rhodium ratio of 5, and they do not increase if the phosphite to rhodium ratio is increased further (Fig. 6). At a ligand to rhodium ratio of 7, the polymer concentration reaches the critical overlap concentration, c*, and subsequently the reaction rate decreases. Although inactive in the hydroformylation of cyclooctene, copolymer-bound catalysts with high chain loadings do show moderate activity in the reaction with styrene (area 3, Fig. 5) . At lower chain loadings, the activity drops, reaching its minimum at a ;:t~ 0.15. At this point the reaction does not obey first order kinetics anymore. The initial reaction rate of the copolymer-bound catalysts with a chain loading of 0.14 is high, but the activity decreases with time to zero within one hour. This process of deactivation is accelerated when a dimeric precursor such as rhodium cyclooctadiene acetate is used instead of rhodium cyclooctadiene 2,4-pentadionate. For other copolymer-bound catalysts as well as for the low molecular weight analogue no deactivation or any influence of the precursor type was found. The lost activity can be (partly) restored if extra hydrogen pressure (p (H2) = 70 bar) is applied. When the catalyst is kept under oxo-conditions for several hours before styrene is added, the same activity is measured. The highest reaction rates in the hydroformylation of styrene are observed if a catalyst with a low chain loading, a, is used (area 1, Fig. 5) . This catalyst does show first order dependence on the alkene (styrene and cyclooctene) concentration. Simulations Energy minimization (EM) A conformational search over the trans and gauche conformations of 7 torsional angles in the polymer backbone was applied on the copolymer model depicted in Fig. 3. For the sake of clarity and speed of the search, the phenyl group of the model was omitted. The conformation of the phosphite ligands was derived from the crystal structure of the bis-phosphite rhodium 2,4-pentadionato complex. The conformations found by this search with a relatively low total energy (within 10% of the lowest found) were selected and displayed. The conformation which could possibly be a segment of a polymer chain and form a bis-coordinated rhodium complex was energy minimized, keeping the phosphorus binding angles and lengths as they were in the crystal structure. The phosphorus-phosphorus distance in the energy minimized conformation was 7 A. A constraint was used to bring the two phosphorus atoms towards each other (in steps of 0.5 A). No noticeable increase in total energy was observed until the phosphorus atoms were 4 A apart. A dummy rhodium atom T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 29 was introduced, with a fixed Rh-P distance (2.16 A, derived from the crystal structure). The structure was energy minimized again. The natural P-Rh-P angle (\"bite angle\") was 98 . On varying the P-Rh-P angle it was found that it was energetically very difficult to create a P-Rh-P angle of 180 (increase of 20% of the total energy), but angles of 100-120 were feasible (no significant increase in total energy). Discussion The structure of the catalyst The spectroscopic experiments with low molecular weight phosphite, 1, indicate that at low HZ/CO pressure the 2,4-pentadionate is still coordinated to the rhodium complex. At high pressure the 2,4-pentadionate ligand is exchanged by carbonyl and hydride ligands, yielding rhodium hydride complexes. At low pressure complex structures (3) and (4) can be derived from the spectroscopic data. Complex (4) was crystallized from a toluene solution, and an X-ray structure was determined [ 15 ] . Complex (3) was found earlier with tris (2,4,6-trimethyl phenyl) phosphite, tris (2-t-butyl phenyl) phosphite [ 3 ] and bis(2-methyl-6-t-butylphenyl)phenyl phosphite [4] as ligand in similar systems. With these bulky ligands bisphosphite rhodium complexes, like (4 ), were not found. From the X-ray structure of complex (4) the cone angle [8] of the phosphite, used in this study was determined to be 164 , which apparently is small enough to yield bisphosphite complexes. Bis-triphenyl phosphite rhodium 2,4-pentadionate complexes were reported by Trzeciak and Ziolkowski [ 16 ] . o P = (1) (3) P (4) P = (1) At high syn-gas pressures, complexes containing more than one phosphite are also found. From the triplet in the losRh-1H NMR correlated 2D spectrum it is clear that a bisphosphite rhodium hydride complex is present. The phosphite groups are symmetrically situated around the rhodium or they exchange rapidly since only a single doublet is found in the 31P NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum shows small P-H couplings indicating a cis conformation of the phosphorus ligands with regard to the hydride, and/or a rapid exchange between coupling constants with opposite signs. The 18-electron complex (5 ) is consistent with all the spectroscopic data [ 17 ] . 30 T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 P 0 H C 1 P H-Rh~ (a) f-= OC-Rh~ (b) \\P \\P C C P = (1) (5) 0 0 Upon increasing the phosphite to rhodium ratio, a new set of peaks arises in the 31P NMR spectrum. At room temperature the spectrum is very broadened, but resolved 31P NMR spectra have been recorded at low temperatures. The 1H NMR spectrum showed one peak in the hydride region at room temperature, but two at - 60 C. This indicates that two extra (rhodium-hydride) complexes are formed when the phosphite concentration is increased. A simulated 31P NMR spectrum, calculated using two spin systems (an ABX and a C3X, X is rhodium and A, B and C are phosphorus atoms) matches the experimental spectrum very well. So, the set of peaks can be ascribed to two complexes of the form HRhP2 (CO) 2 (ABX) and HRhP3 (CO) (C3X). Although we do not have evidence that a tris-coordinated complex is involved (CX, CA, CA and C4X are not distinguishable), the fact that a very high phosphite concentration is necessary to form the complexes and that RhP4 complexes are sterically unfavorable makes this assumption plausible. Remarkably, this bulky phosphite is small enough to yield rhodium hydride complexes containing two or three phosphites, whereas tris (2-t-butylphenyl) phosphite as a ligand strictly yields monophosphite complexes. The two complexes as catalysts in hydroformylation reactions however show very strongly similar behaviour. The complex formation of copolymer-bound rhodium complexes is dependent on the chain loading, a. At high chain loadings a doublet is found in the 31P NMR spectrum, at the same place as for the low molecular weight analogue, suggesting that the same complexes (type 5) are present in both systems. The IR data are consistent with this conclusion; three absorptions appear in the carbonyl region of the IR spectrum. After changing the HZ/CO gas mixture into D2/CO only two peaks remain. This proves that one of the three peaks is a Rh-H vibration. The shift of the two remaining peaks after deuteration to 2047 and 1997 cm-1 indicates that all three vibrations belong to the same group. Thus, the complex consists of two carbonyl ligands and one hydride. At low chain loadings a mixture of complexes is present in the reaction mixture. A broad band of peaks is found in the 31P NMR spectrum. First of all, from the shoulders in the IR spectrum, the bisphosphite complex, as is found for copolymers with high chain loading, can be identified. The peak at 2009 cm-1 represents the carbonyl vibration of the rhodium 2,4-pentadionate phosphite carbonyl complex, analogous to the low molecular weight complex (3 ) -Hz Rh-H + Rh-H (_*HRh-Rh z Scheme 1. Schematic representation of a dimer hydride equilibrium. T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mod. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 31 which shows the same vibration in the IR spectrum. Still, two major peaks have not been ascribed. It was noted that the two peaks change intensity independently of each other, proving that they belong to two separate complexes. The intensity of the peak at 2076 cm-1 increases when the chain loading, a, increases (from 0.04 to 0.08). When the hydrogen pressure is increased, the intensity of the peak at 2076 cm-1 decreases in favor of the peak at 1991 cm-1, proving that the two peaks belong to two complexes which are in equilibrium with each other. This equilibrium is pushed towards the complex with a vibration at 1991 cm-1, when the hydrogen pressure is increased. Therefore, the peak at 1991 cm-1 is assigned to a hydride species. A well known [ 18 ] equilibrium in rhodium catalysis which is influenced by hydrogen is the dimerization of two rhodium hydrides (Scheme 1). Low chain loading, a, of the copolymer means that the distance between two adjacent phosphite groups is large (known as site isolation). The conformational entropy loss of a polymeric chain when a bisphosphite rhodium complex is formed will be substantial, i.e. at low chain loadings monophosphite complexes are favored. Due to the low coordination number the complexes will have an open active site which makes them good catalysts [ 19 ] , but this also will make them susceptible to dimerization. On shortening the distance between the phosphite groups (increasing a) the local rhodium concentration is enhanced, shifting the equilibrium towards the dimeric complex. This explains the increased amount of complexes with an absorption at 2076 cm-1 (i.e. dimeric complexes) when a is increased. Activity of the catalysts The low molecular weight analogue The activity of the low molecular weight catalyst increases with the ligand concentration (Fig. 6) . From earlier studies [ 3 ] it is suggested that the active species in the hydroformylation of cyclooctene with tris (2-t-butylphenyl ) phosphite modified rhodium catalysts is a monophosphite complex. The increase inactivity on increasing the phosphite (1) concentration therefore cannot be ascribed to an increased amount of active complexes. Since a monophosphite complex is the active species, the activity is expected to drop with increased ligand concentration. The role of the phosphite ligands apparently is somewhat more complex, and we tentatively propose the following explanation (see Scheme 2): Due to electronic effects, the oxidative addition of hydrogen to a rhodium acyl complex with two phosphites may be faster than that to a monophosphite complex. This effect might lead to an increased overall reaction rate. Thus, the overall effect of an increased phosphite concentration can be positive, although the amount of coordinatively unsaturated species in the initial stage of the catalytic cycle is decreased. The copolymer-pound catalysts High chain loading (area 3, Fig. 5, Scheme 3). The hydroformylation of cyclooctene proceeds almost exclusively at low chain loadings (area 1, Fig. 5 ). 32 T.

Reaction scheme showing the positive effect of a second phosphite ligand on the overall reaction rate. At elevated chain loadings the activity drops to almost zero. From EM model calculations the distance between two adjacent phosphorus atoms in a copolymer with a chain loading of 0.50 is about 7 A and can be reduced to 4.5 A without increase in total energy (Fig. 3 ). It should be borne in mind that only a small fragment of the polymer chain was used for the model study. When polymer segments are attached on either side of the fragment, the interphosphite distance of 7 A might even decrease due to steric interactions. The RhP bond length is approximately 2.20 A, so the gain in (conformational) entropy, when a Rh-P bond of a bis-phosphite complex is broken, will be very small. Moreover, the \"bite angle\" of the model depicted in Fig. 3 is 100-120 , which is within the range of angles depicted of the trigonal bipyramidal complex 5b. The chances for a phosphite group to dissociate will therefore be very small, thus active monophosphite complexes cannot be formed. Cyclooctene cannot reach the active site and subsequently no reaction takes place. As the coordination of a terminal alkene is easier than that of an internal alkene, the steric hindrance caused by the two phosphite groups cannot entirely prevent the reaction of styrene with rhodium hydrides, but the activity, however, is much lower than that of the low molecular weight. analogue. Low chain loadings (area 1, Fig. 5, Scheme 3). When the chain loading is low, monophosphite complexes predominate (area 1, Fig. 5 ). The accessibility of the rhodium complex is good, the coordination of alkenes is not hindered, and activity of copolymer-bound catalysts with low chain loadings is significantly higher than with high chain loading. The low coordination number induced by the copolymer chain does not enhance the activity of the copolymerbound system above the activity of the low molecular weight analogue (Fig. 6 ). Intermediate chain loadings (area 2, Fig. 5, Scheme 3). At moderate chain loadings (area 2, Fig. 5) the distance between two adjacent phosphite groups T. JongsO et al. / J. Mol.

P P P P\\Rh/P P P P P Rh Kh Scheme 4. is short enough to allow coordination of two phosphite ligands to one rhodium nucleus. The possibility of the association and dissociation of a second phosphite enables the rhodium complex to \"walk\" along the copolymer chain (Scheme 4) . However, as the mean distance between two adjacent phosphites is still rather large, it is not very likely that rhodium nuclei remain trapped in a bisphosphite complex (5) as was found for high chain loadings (area 3, Fig. 5). The consequence of this mobility is that, in the end, rhodium nuclei will meet. Due to their open site they are very susceptible to dimerization reactions. The formation of inactive dimeric complexes is very likely to occur. This explains the area of low activity at intermediate chain loadings. Other experimental data support this explanation: The initial activity of the catalyst is strongly reduced when [ Rh (acetate) COD ] 2, a dimeric complex, is used as precursor. Using a dimeric precursor yields two rhodium nuclei on the same chain in the vicinity of each other. This means that they will meet immediately, and form an inactive dimer. Furthermore, the catalyst can be partly reactivated when the hydrogen pressure is increased i.e., when the equilibrium in Scheme 1 is pushed backwards. Both results indicate that the deactivation proceeds via 34 T. Jongsma et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)17-35 a dimerization reaction of two rhodium nuclei (Scheme 1) . The nature of the dimeric species is still unknown. Dimeric complexes like Rh2(CO)8-,Lx (x= 0-2, L - P (OPh) 3) or tetrameric complexes Rh4 (CO )12 _ xLx (x=1-4, L = P (OPh) 3) as described by Brown et al. [ 20 ] have more complicated infrared spectra. Furthermore, these complexes were not fragmented under hydrogen pressure. Without alkene the catalyst could be stored at 80 C under 20 bar CO/H2 pressure for several hours, without influencing the catalytic activity. When after this period, alkene was added, the reaction started and proceeded in the normal way. This means that the deactivation only occurs when substrate is present. Thus, displacement of rhodium species along the chain and subsequent formation of inactive complexes only occurs when alkene is present. The high (initial) activity can be ascribed to the possibility of forming temporarily bisphosphite complexes which are not stabilized by the chelating effects described for high a. The distance between two adjacent phosphites is large enough to allow monophosphite complexes to be formed. This means that the alkene coordination is facile but that the catalytic cycle can be accelerated by coordination of a second phosphite ligand. Coordination of alkene initiates the catalytic cycle, and hence the exchange of phosphites. Subsequently the rhodium complex starts \"walking\" along the chain, eventually resulting in dimerization. This explains why deactivation only occurs when the hydroformylation is in progress.
