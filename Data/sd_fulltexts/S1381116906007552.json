Graphical abstract [MoI2(CO)3(DAB)] is one example of a family of complexes that were immobilized in MCM-41 in a stepwise procedure (grafting of the DAB ligand and coordination), characterized, and tested for catalytic activity in ring-opening polymerization reactions with norbornene and norbornadiene. [MX2(CO)3(DAB)] (M=Mo, W; X=I, Br) (5–8) complexes bearing the 1,4-diazobutadiene (DAB) ligand RNC(Ph)C(Ph)NR [R=(CH2)3Si(OEt)3] were immobilized in MCM-41 mesoporous silica. The tethering, stepwise procedure started with treatment of the MCM-41 mesoporous material with a toluene solution of the 1,4-diazobutadiene ligand, under reflux. The molybdenum and tungsten organometallic cores were subsequently introduced into the ligand-silicas by pore volume impregnation of a solution of the complexes [MX2(CO)3(NCMe)2] (M=Mo, W; X=Br, I). The modified materials were extensively characterized by several techniques, such as FTIR, solid-state MAS and CP MAS NMR (13C, 29Si), powder XRD, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. These new materials (containing 2.6–2.9wt.% Mo or 0.4–0.6wt.% W) catalyze the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene (NBE) and norbornadiene at 328K, in contrast with the very low activity exhibited by the precursor complexes and with their behavior at lower temperature. Addition of AlCl3 as a co-catalyst enhanced the catalytic performance of the material MCM-DAB-MoBr2 (12) in the ROMP of NBE. Keywords Molybdenum Tungsten MCM-41 Polymerization DAB ligands Hepta-coordination Catalysis 1 Introduction Organometallic complexes can efficiently and selectively catalyze many reactions and are widely applied in industrial processes. One drawback of such homogeneous catalysts is the difficulty of separating the products from the reaction solution and recovering and recycling the catalyst. Therefore, the possibility of incorporating complexes in materials to yield heterogeneous catalysts has opened new possibilities in recent years [1,2]. Seven-coordinate Mo(II) complexes [MX2(CO)3L2] (M=Mo, W; X=halogen) and their derivatives, obtained by replacing the labile nitrile ligands, have been extensively investigated [3–5]. Their synthesis [6–9], structures [10,11] and properties have been studied since they were reported for the first time by Nigam and Nyholm in 1957 [12], and they have been shown to exhibit catalytic activity [13,14]. Complexes [M(CO)3X2(NCMe)2] have been successfully used by Baker and co-workers in the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene (NBE) and norbornadiene (NBD) [15,16] with satisfactory results, though some of the complexes were only active upon the addition of a Lewis acid, such as AlCl3 or ZrCl4. Szymańska-Buzar et al. carried out the study of ROMP reactions with seven-coordinate Mo(II) and W(II) complexes [17–19]. The micelle templated silicas MCM-41 (hereafter denoted as MCM) belong to the M41S family developed by Mobil Corporation in 1992 [20,21], and display a set of properties, such as a stable and ordered mesoporous structure, large surface area (usually >1000m2 g−1), and narrow pore size distribution, which make them ideal for hosting molecules of various sizes, shapes and functionalities. These features are suitable for the inclusion of organometallic complexes and have led to significant developments, among others, in the fields of catalysis, adsorption/sorption, separation, sensors, optically active materials [1,22]. The number of papers describing this type of chemistry has been growing each year [1,2,23]. In the present work, bis(acetonitrile) Mo(II) and W(II) complexes were used as precursors for the immobilization of organometallic species in MCM, by a tethering approach. In the first step, the triethoxysilyl-N-substituted 1,4-diazobutadiene (DAB) ligand was grafted on the host material MCM-41, and was subsequently allowed to react with the organometallic complexes [MX2(CO)3(NCMe)2] (M=Mo, W; X=Br, I). The derivatized materials were fully characterized and tested as catalysts for the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornadiene (NBD) and norbornene (NBE). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The organometallic complexes The functionalized triethoxysilyl ligand RNC(Ph)C(Ph)NR (DAB) [R(CH2)3Si(OEt)3] was prepared by the reaction of benzil [C6H5(CO)(CO)C6H5] with two equivalents of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, according to a well-known procedure [24]. The precursor complexes [MX2(CO)3(NCMe)2] (M=Mo, W; X=I or Br) (1–4) [25] were allowed to react with one equivalent of the DAB ligand, affording the complexes [MX2(CO)3{Ph-DAB-CH2Si(OEt)3}2] (M=Mo, W; X=I or Br) (5–8) by displacement of both labile acetonitrile ligands and in good yield. These complexes were subsequently immobilized on the MCM-41 host material, as outlined in Scheme 1 [24,26]. Both the ligand DAB [24] and the precursor complexes 1–4 [25] have been characterized elsewhere and therefore will not be discussed here. The 1H NMR spectrum of [MoI2(CO)3{Ph-DAB-CH2Si(OEt)3}2] (5) shows a multiplet in the range 7.36< δ <7.95ppm assigned to the phenyl groups, as well as multiplet signals at δ =3.47–3.52ppm (NCH 2), 1.93–1.98ppm (CH2CH 2CH2) and a broad singlet at 0.71ppm (SiCH 2) for the propyl chains. The presence of ethoxy groups is reflected by signals at δ =3.47–3.52ppm (OCH 2, convoluted with NCH 2) and 1.04ppm (CH 3). These signals are slightly shifted relative to those of the free ligand DAB, which exhibits three multiplets at δ =7.32–7.50ppm, 7.57–7.75ppm, and 7.88–7.93ppm (aromatic protons), and resonances at δ =3.40–3.44ppm, 1.76–1.86ppm and 0.60–0.68ppm assigned to the NCH 2, CH2CH 2CH2, and SiCH 2, respectively; the ethoxy groups peaks are observed at δ =3.73–3.84ppm (OCH 2CH3) and 1.15–1.24ppm (OCH2CH 3) [24]. The absence of resonances from the acetonitrile ligands indicates the coordination of the ligand to the molybdenum centre. This is confirmed by the 13C NMR spectrum, displaying one resonance at δ =166.7ppm, due to the N C atoms, and signals at δ =128.9ppm, 128.0ppm and 127.2ppm, assigned to the aromatic carbon atoms. Signals from the propyl chains appear at δ =68.7ppm (NCH2), 21.7ppm (CH2 CH2CH2) and 13.1ppm (SiCH2). The ethoxy groups have resonances at δ =58.1ppm (OCH2) and 20.4ppm (CH3). The FTIR spectrum of [MoI2(CO)3{Ph-DAB-CH2Si(OEt)3}2] (5) shows the displacement of the labile acetonitrile ligands during the synthesis, as evidenced by the absence of the ν CN stretching modes at ca. 2300cm−1 (Table 1 ). A new band at 1637cm−1 is clearly observed arising from the new ν CN mode, and two broad and intense bands assigned to ν sio stretching modes appear at 1116cm−1 and 1024cm−1. In the free ligand DAB, the band corresponding to the ν CN mode is observed at 1647cm−1. The shift of the ν CN band to lower frequency is indicative of the coordination of DAB to the complex [MoI2(CO)3(MeCN)2] (1), with weakening of the CN bond. For complex 6 [MoBr2(CO)3{Ph-DAB-CH2Si(OEt)3}2], comparable changes in the vibrational spectrum occur, but the ν CN mode is shifted to lower wavenumbers than in 5. This suggests a stronger MN bond of the metal centre to DAB in the dibromo complex 6 than in the diiodo one 5. The bands assigned to the ν sio stretching modes in complex 6 are observed at 1167cm−1 and 1075cm−1. Some small changes are also observed for the ν C≡O bands upon chelation of the DAB ligand to the bis(acetonitrile) Mo(II) complexes 1 and 2 and for the corresponding W(II) complexes, as shown in Table 1. This indicates that the formation of MoN bonds affects to some extent the strength of the MoC bonds by changing the amount of π-backdonation to the carbonyl ligands. The spectroscopic characterization of all the complexes 5–8 by 1H, 13C NMR and FTIR led to similar results (see Section 4 for remaining complexes). 2.2 The functionalized materials Two lots of samples of MCM-41 host material 9 or 9 * (* denotes a different lot) were prepared by a template approach as described previously [24]. This material was then derivatized by grafting of the phenyl-substituted 1,4-diazobutadiene ligand DAB onto the silica-matrix mesoporous host material, in toluene, overnight. After filtration, the solids were washed thoroughly with dichloromethane, and dried in vacuum at 100°C for several hours, originating materials 10 or 10 *, respectively. This procedure has been reported by I.S. Gonçalves and co-workers to immobilize dioxomolybdenum(VI) species using the ligand-silica system 10, which originated active catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins [24,26]. In this work, 10 or 10 * were allowed to react with an excess of the bis(acetonitrile)complexes (1–4) in methylene chloride, overnight, at room temperature, and after filtering and drying, afforded the composite materials 11, 12 and 13, 14, respectively. In the case of 11 and 12, the molybdenum loadings were 2.6wt.% and 2.9wt.% (0.27mmolg−1 and 0.30mmolg−1), respectively. For the tungsten containing materials 13 and 14, the results show metal loadings of only 0.4wt.% and 0.6wt.% (0.05mmolg−1 and 0.09mmolg−1), respectively. These results indicate that the immobilization of the tungsten complexes was not very successful, although several attempts were pursued. The new materials were characterized by powder XRD diffraction, adsorption studies, FTIR and solid-state 13C and 29Si NMR. The powder XRD patterns for the process-control are shown in Fig. 1 . The powder pattern of the MCM parent, calcined material 9, clearly shows four reflections in the 2θ range 2–10°, indexed to a hexagonal cell as (100), (110), (200) and (210). The d-value of the (100) reflection was 34.6Å (34.8Å for material 9 *), corresponding to a lattice constant of a =40.0Å (= 2 d 100 / 3 ) (40.2Å for material 9 *). Upon functionalization of the walls of the parent host material 9 or 9 * with the diazobutadiene ligand DAB and subsequent inclusion of the metallic complexes (1–4), the powder patterns remain unchanged in what concerns the positions of the peaks assigned to the characteristic reflections, suggesting the retention of the long range hexagonal symmetry of the host material. However, a drastic reduction of the peaks intensities is clearly observed. This is not interpreted as a loss of crystallinity, but rather to a reduction in the X-ray scattering contrast between the silica walls and pore-filling material, a situation well described in the literature [27,28]. Nitrogen adsorption studies at 77K revealed that the pristine MCM samples (9 and 9 *) exhibit reversible type IV isotherms (Fig. 2 ), characteristic of mesoporous solids (pore width between 2nm and 50nm, according to the IUPAC) [29]. The calculated textural parameters (S BET and V t) of these materials agree with literature data (Table 2 ) [30,31]. The capillary condensation/evaporation steps of pristine MCM samples appear in the relative pressures range 0.26–0.4. The sharpness of this step reflects the uniform pore size. The isotherms of the functionalized materials revealed much lower N2 uptake, accounting for decreases in S BET (52–63%) and V t (67–76%). These results suggest that immobilization of the complexes on the internal silica surface was accomplished (Fig. 2, Table 2). This conclusion is also supported by the decrease of the p/p 0 coordinates of the inflection points of the isotherms upon post-synthesis treatments [32]. The height of the capillary condensation step, which is related to the volume of pore space confined by absorbate film on the pore walls, is much smaller in the case of the modified MCM materials. Furthermore, the maximum of the PSD curve for MCM determined by the BJH method, d BJH, decreases from 3.7nm to less than 3nm (Table 2). The FTIR spectrum of the parent host material MCM 9 (Fig. 3 ) is similar to that of other mesoporous siliceous matrices [27,28]. The bands at 1235cm−1 and 1087cm−1 are assigned to the ν asym mode of the SiOSi framework, the corresponding ν sym mode appearing at ca. 800cm−1. An absorption at 963cm−1 is assigned to a δ SiO mode of the SiOH groups [27,28]. The treatment of MCM 9 with DAB led to the derivatized material 10, which presents new bands in the vibrational spectrum relative to that of 9. The bands at 3067cm−1, 2978cm−1, 2927cm−1 and 2891cm−1 are assigned to ν CH modes of the ligand. The band at 1652cm−1 can be assigned to the ν C=N mode of the ligand (1647cm−1 in free DAB), suggesting that the ligand was immobilized inside the pores of the host material without its structure being affected. The β CH and ν CC modes of the ligand are responsible for a set of three bands at 1494cm−1, 1447cm−1 and 1390cm−1. The presence of the carbonyl ligands in the immobilized complexes allows valuable information to be extracted from the vibrational spectra of the new materials, as the ν CO stretching mode is a very strong one. Chelation of the immobilized ligand 10 to the metal fragments MX2(CO)3 (M=Mo; X=I, Br) is also deduced from the vibrational spectra. The appearance of the bands at 2073cm−1, 2022cm−1 and 1954cm−1, assigned as the ν C≡O modes for 11, denotes the presence of three coordinated carbonyl groups, and the retention of the organometallic M(CO)3 core during the immobilization procedure. The absence of the bands at 2276cm−1 and 2304cm−1, corresponding to the ν C≡N modes of the acetonitrile in the precursors, reflects their substitution by other ligands. Moreover, the ν C=N mode of the DAB ligand is observed at 1631cm−1, a value lower than that of the free ligand, indicating chelation to the metal centre. In the case of 12, the corresponding ν C≡O bands are observed at 2082cm−1, 2018cm−1 and 1944cm−1, and the ν CN mode of the ligand at 1627cm−1. The composite materials 13 and 14 containing W(II) (prepared from 10 *) were found to exhibit similar spectroscopical features to those of the Mo(II) analogues (materials 11 and 12), with absence of the ν C≡N bands and the presence of bands assigned to the carbonyls, suggesting that the W(CO)3 fragments were also successfully immobilized inside the pores of the MCM host material. All the materials were also characterized by 29Si MAS and CP MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4 , the 29Si MAS and CP MAS spectra present some changes reflecting the evolution of the tethering procedure during the preparation of the composite materials. The spectra of material 9 show the presence of two convoluted resonances assigned to Q 3 and Q 4 (Q n = Si (OSi) n (OH)4−n ) at δ =−102.0ppm and −109.0ppm, respectively. Also a minimal amount of Q 2 species can be observed at δ =−92.5ppm. Upon grafting of the chelating ligand to the walls of the parent host material, the spectra of the new material 10 shows a reduction of the intensities of the resonances assigned to Q 2 and Q 3 species, owing to the silylation of the surface by nucleophilic substitution. Although the Q 3 sites are the most reactive, some remain unreacted at the surface, suggesting that they can be blocked to functionalization due to hydrogen bonding (SiO)3SiOH…OHSi(SiO)3 [29]. The spectra of materials 10, 11 and 12 show three new convoluted signals in the −50ppm to −58ppm range. These resonances are associated with organosilica species T 1, T 2 and T 3, where T m = RSi (OSi) m (OEt)3−m . The presence of these signals in the spectra is indicative of the successful introduction of the ligand DAB, and also shows that the ligand is covalently bound to the surface of the host material. The 29Si NMR spectra of materials 11 and 12 are similar to that of 10. In fact, since the ligand binds to the metal centres by the nitrogen atoms, no significant alterations of the silica atoms chemical shifts would be expected. The 13C CP MAS NMR of the functionalized material 10 is very similar to that of the free DAB ligand (liquid 13C NMR), Fig. 5 . Only a slight decrease in the intensity of resonances assigned to the SiO CH2 CH3 groups is observed, which is expected, since the binding of the ligand to the surface of the host material takes place by the hydrolysis of these groups. The resonances due to the aromatic nuclei in materials 11 and 12 are also well described, despite the large width of the signal. Nevertheless, the solution 13C NMR of complex 5 (and 6), described earlier in this work, made possible the observation of all signals. The resonances corresponding to the C N and C≡O carbon atoms are not clear in the 13C CP MAS NMR of materials 11 and 12, owing to the overlapping of the spinside band and of the high relaxation time of the carbonyl groups. Despite this, the presence of such groups is confirmed by the corresponding FTIR spectrum (see above). The solid-state NMR studies for the W(II) containing materials 13 and 14 led to the same conclusions found for composite materials 11 and 12, as in the case of the FTIR results: a full description of spectral data can be found in Section 4. 2.3 Polymerization catalytic studies The study of olefin polymerization catalyzed by Mo(II) and W(II) systems has received much attention over the last years [15–19]. Complexes 1–4 have already been tested for ROMP catalysis of NBE and NBD (polyNBE and polyNBD denote the corresponding polymer product). Metathesis polymerization of NBD is successfully carried out by complexes [MX2(CO)3(NCMe)2] at room temperature for X=Br, whereas the diiodo requires a co-catalyst, such as ZrCl4 or AlCl3, in order to initiate polymerization [15 and references therein]. Complexes 5–8 did not catalyze the ROMP reactions of NBE and NBD at 298K (see other conditions in Section 4). At 328K, however, some catalytic activity was observed, yielding 1–8% polymer (Table 3 ). Complex 6 (M=Mo, X=Br) presents a slightly higher activity than the remaining ones. The composite materials 11–14 are more active catalysts for this reaction than the homogeneous counterparts 5–8. Probably, the Si(OEt)3 groups present in the complexes, lead to the formation of less active or inactive oligomeric catalytic species [24]. Neither the pristine MCM host material 9 nor the DAB derivatized material 10 possess catalytic activity towards the ROMP of the olefins, indicating that the active species must contain Mo or W. For all metal-containing catalysts, the ROMP of NBE is easier to accomplish than that of NBD. This is in agreement with literature results, where some authors reported that NBD is less readily polymerized than NBE [19]. The Mo-containing catalysts are more active than the tungsten analogues. The highest catalytic activity was observed for the derivatized material 12 (M=Mo, X=Br), giving TOF of 280gmol Mo −1 h−1 and 80gmol Mo −1 h−1 for ROMP of NBE and NBD, respectively. These results reflect the highest activity of complex 6 (M=Mo, X=Br) in homogeneous phase. In general, polymer yields obtained in the presence of the supported catalysts are better than those found for the corresponding unsupported complexes 5–8, although the values are not very high (Table 3). They may be improved by increasing the reaction temperature. For example, in the case of 12, a rise in temperature of 30K leads to a three-fold increase in polyNBE yield. It has been reported that the incorporation of aluminium in MCM, used as co-catalyst in metallocene systems, enhances the catalytic activity in ethene polymerization [33]. Accordingly, the performance of these catalysts may be improved by changing the support properties, by doping the silica-matrix with aluminium or by the addition of a co-catalyst, such as AlCl3. In order to check the effect of added aluminium, a catalytic reaction using material 12, AlCl3, and NBE in the molar ration of 1:3:200 at 328K, was carried out. After 72h, the reaction was stopped and the yield of polyNBE was estimated to be 59% with TOF of 476g mo l Mo − 1 h−1. This result is better than that obtained without AlCl3, indicating that the co-catalyst has a beneficial effect. It should, however, be mentioned that AlCl3 alone did not show any catalytic activity. The catalytic performance of catalyst 12 was also evaluated in a second reaction cycle. After reaction, the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction solution by filtration, and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of methanol. Both the conversion and polymer yield decreased from the first to the second run (Table 3). ICP-AES of the used and recovered solids showed that from the first to the second runs there is a 0.5% loss of metal, indicating that metal leaching does not occur to a great extent. The catalyst recovery procedure may be inefficient to remove all of the organic matter entrapped in the pore system, accounting for partial loss of catalytic activity observed upon recycling. 3 Conclusions The immobilization of hepta-coordinate halocarbonyl Mo(II) and W(II) complexes on MCM was successfully accomplished by the tethering approach, using a phenyl-substituted 1,4-diazobutadiene spacer, and was confirmed by several techniques. For instance, the bands assigned to ν C≡O modes observed by FTIR showed the incorporation of the organometallic M(CO)3 cores and the retention of their integrity. The immobilization of W(II) complexes inside the pores of the MCM-41 host material was not so successful as that of the Mo(II) analogues, according to the results of the metal loadings. While in homogeneous phase complexes 5–8 exhibit poor catalytic activity (complex 6 (M=Mo, X=Br) being the most active), the catalytic performance of the corresponding heterogenized catalysts (11–14) in the ROMP of olefins is far superior. In general, the conversions are higher for NBE than for NBD. Nevertheless, the polymer yields achieved with the solid catalysts described in this work are, in general, relatively low. Polymer yield tends to increase with reaction temperature. The addition of AlCl3 as a co-catalyst enhanced the catalytic performance of the material MCM-DAB-MoBr2 (12) in the ROMP of NBE. 4 Experimental 4.1 General All preparations and manipulations were performed using standard Schlenk techniques under nitrogen. Commercial grade solvents were dried and deoxygenated by standard procedures (Et2O over Na/benzophenone ketyl; CH2Cl2 and CH3CN over CaH2), distilled under nitrogen and kept over 4Å molecular sieves (3Å for CH3CN). Purely siliceous MCM was synthesized as described previously using [(C16H33)N(CH3)3]Br as the templating agent [24]. After calcinations (540°C for 6h), the material was characterized by powder XRD, N2 adsorption and IR spectroscopy. Prior to the grafting experiment, physisorbed water was removed from calcined MCM by heating at 180°C in vacuum (10−2 Pa) for 2h. Microanalyses were performed at the University of Aveiro. BET specific surface areas (S BET, p/p 0 from 0.03 to 0.13) and specific total pore volume, V t, were estimated from N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77K. The pore size distributions (PSD) were calculated by the BJH method using the modified Kelvin equation with correction for the statistical film thickness on the pore walls [34,35]. The statistical film thickness was calculated using Harkins–Jura equation in the p/p 0 range from 0.1 to 0.95. Powder XRD data were collected on a Phillips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation filtered by graphite. FTIR spectra in transmission mode were measured with a Mattson Satellite FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets. 1H and 13C solution NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer. 29Si and 13C solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at 79.49MHz and 100.62MHz, respectively, on a (9.4T) Bruker Avance 400P spectrometer. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 40° pulses, spinning rates 5.0–5.5kHz, and 60s recycle delays. 29Si CP MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 5.5μs 1H 90° pulses, 8ms contact time, a spinning rate of 4.5kHz, and 4s recycle delays. 13C CP MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 4.5μs 1H 90° pulse, 2ms contact time, a spinning rate of 8kHz, and 4s recycle delays. Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm from TMS. 13C spectra were also recorded in the solid-state at 125.76MHz on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer. Phenyl-substituted 1,4-diazobutadiene ligand (DAB) was prepared as described previously [24]. The precursor organometallic complexes MoI2(CO)3(NCCH3)2 (1), MoBr2(CO)3(NCCH3)2 (2), WI2(CO)3(NCCH3)2 (3) and WBr2(CO)3(NCCH3)2 (4) were also prepared according to literature methods [25]. 4.2 Catalytic studies The complexes and materials reported herein were tested in the ROMP of NBE and NBD under N2 atmosphere at 298K and 328K and using toluene as solvent. The polymers were precipitated by addition of methanol at the end of the reaction, i.e., after 72h and upon catalyst separation. The catalytic reactions using complexes 5–8 were carried out using a catalyst/olefin molar ratio of 1:200. In the case of the studies using the composite materials 11–14 a metal/olefin molar ratio of 1:200 (based on the metal loadings as determined by ICP-AES) was used. For the catalytic reaction using AlCl3 as co-catalyst the metal/Al/olefin molar ratio was 1:3:200. In a typical experiment, a certain amount of the materials with 18.5mmol of olefin was mixed in toluene (10ml) at 298K or 328K. All the reactions were stopped after 72h. This was accomplished by separating the catalysts by filtration, followed by the addition of methanol to the toluene solution in order to precipitate the polymer. The solid polymer was separated by filtration and the polymers dried in vacuum before being weighed. The yields were calculated based on the initial weight of olefin used. The identification of the polymers was done by 1H NMR [15–19]. 4.3 Preparation of the complexes of type [MX2(CO)3(DAB)] (M=Mo or W, and X=I or Br) (5–8) A solution of 1–4 (0.50mmol) in acetonitrile (10ml) was treated with 1 equivalent of ligand DAB in acetonitrile (5ml). The resulting turbid solution was stirred for 4h at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated, and the solid product washed with hexane and dried in vacuum. 4.3.1 [MoI2(CO)3(DAB)] (5) Yield: 85%.

The tethering, stepwise procedure started with treatment of the MCM-41 mesoporous material with a toluene solution of the 1,4-diazobutadiene ligand, under reflux. The molybdenum and tungsten organometallic cores were subsequently introduced into the ligand-silicas by pore volume impregnation of a solution of the complexes [MX2(CO)3(NCMe)2] (M=Mo, W; X=Br, I). The modified materials were extensively characterized by several techniques, such as FTIR, solid-state MAS and CP MAS NMR (13C, 29Si), powder XRD, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. These new materials (containing 2.6–2.9wt.% Mo or 0.4–0.6wt.% W) catalyze the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene (NBE) and norbornadiene at 328K, in contrast with the very low activity exhibited by the precursor complexes and with their behavior at lower temperature. Addition of AlCl3 as a co-catalyst enhanced the catalytic performance of the material MCM-DAB-MoBr2 (12) in the ROMP of NBE.",
