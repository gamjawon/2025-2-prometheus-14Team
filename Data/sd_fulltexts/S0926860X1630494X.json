Twiggb aEnergy Research Institute, School of Chemical and Process Engineering, The University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK bTwigg Scientiï¬� c & Technical Ltd., Caxton, Cambridge, CB23 3PQ, UK The reactivity between a NiO catalyst and char from glucose pyrolysis under N2 was studied. The NiO reduction started at 420 C and underwent two stages during a TPR process. A complete reduction without carbon remaining was achieved when the mass ratio of glucose to the catalyst was 1:10 under our experimental condition. This work has a potential implication to exploiting biomass resources via chemical looping technology.

Applied Catalysis A: General, 527 (2016) 9 Regular Articles iv Contents Au/Cuâ€“Feâ€“Laâ€“Al2O3: A highly active, selective and stable catalysts for preferential oxidation of carbon monooxide Xun Sun, Huijuan Su, Qingquan Lin, Chung Han, Yuhua Zheng, Libo Sun, Caixia Qi School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yantai University, Shandong Applied Research Center of Gold Nanotechnology (Au-SDARC), Yantai 264005, PR China Copper precursor was added to a FLA support via wetness impregnation method before Au deposition. High dispersion of Au nanparticles, formation of AuCu alloy, and the close contact of single or alloyed Au nanoparticles to CuO species which makes Au partially positively charged. Copper addition improved overall performance for PROX but lowered activity in O2-rich stream. More Au-CuO interfaces or positively charged gold play a crucial role in promoting CO2 formation in CO-PROX reaction.

Soï¬� ea, R.A. Walkerb aDepartment of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59717, United States bChemistry & Biochemistry Department, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT 59717, United States Ni/YSZ cermet anodes inï¬� ltrated with aluminum titanate (ALT) have reduced degradation rates and improved performance. XRD and Raman data show that the composition of Ni/YSZ doped with ALT depends sensitively on processing temperature with several material phases (Zr5Ti7O24, NiAl2O4, and monoclinic YSZ) appearing only under speciï¬� c sintering conditions. Ex situ analysis of Ni/YSZ anodes inï¬� ltrated with ALT show signiï¬� cantly diminished coarsening after operation in fuel cell mode at 850 C.

Applied Catalysis A: General, 527 (2016) 96 Photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol on titanium dioxide modified with Cu(II) or Cr(III) ion under visible light irradiation Naoto Nishiyamaa, Keisuke Kozasab, Suzuko Yamazakib aDivision of Environmental Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi 753-8512, Japan bDivision of Earth Science, Biology, and Chemistry, Graduate School of Sciences and Technology for Innovation, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi 753-8512, Japan For developing the visible light responsive TiO2 by using Cu 2+ ion, the graft method is more advantageous than the sol-gel method. Photocatalytic activity of Cu-grafted TiO2 is affected by the number-density of Cu2+ on the surface. Cr-doped TiO2 is superior to Cu-grafted TiO2 from the viewpoint of the higher photocatalytic activity as well as the chemical stability in acidic wastewater.
