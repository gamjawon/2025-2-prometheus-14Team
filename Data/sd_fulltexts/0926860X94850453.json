The presence of copper as counter-cations in the heteropoly compounds increases the activity and the selectivity to MAA. This increase is probably due to the simultaneous presence in the solids of Bronsted acidity and oxygen vacancies with an adequate ratio. These latter sites can more easily be obtained in the presence of Cu2+ and V4+ than with Na+ counter-ions in the catalysts.

Introduction It is known [ 1-4]that the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid (IDA) leads to the formation of methacrylic acid (MO), acetone, propene, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and.water following the reaction: *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Aboukal's et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)109-118 OZ acetone + CO, + H20 IBA MAA + H20 propene + CO + H20 This reaction is at present the key step to produce methylmethacrylate (MMA) by esterification of MAA. The MMA in the form of polymers is of economic importance. Heteropolyacid catalysts, particularly H4PVMo, 1040, have been found to be promising catalysts for the conversion of IBA to MAA. Despite their catalytic performance, the weak thermal stability of the heteropolyacids represents a major drawback in industrial processes. It has been previously demonstrated that during catalysis at 320, vanadium ions are ejected from the Keggin structure as V4+ counter-cations [5] . A similar phenomenon was also observed after calcination pretreatment at 320 of the freshly prepared catalyst; under these conditions tetrahedral V5+ counter-cations are detected by solid-state 5'V nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [6]. For the reaction of IBA to MAA, it was clearly shown [ 7 ] that vanadium improves the catalytic performance. Furthermore, the presence of copper as counter-cations in the heteropolyacid catalysts increases the yield of this reaction as well as the stability of the catalyst [ 8 ] . Therefore, the purpose of this work is to find an explanation for the improvement of the catalytic performance and the thermal stability of these catalysts as a result of the simultaneous presence of vanadium and copper counter-cations when these latter partially replace the structural protons of the H,PVMo40 catalyst. 2. Experimental The pure compound 1-vanado,l l-molybdophosphoric acid H4PVMo40- 13Hz0 was prepared by boiling stoichiometric amounts of a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3P04), vanadium pentoxide (V205) and molybdenum trioxide (M003) as long as possible (3 days) at 100 in distilled water. After filtration of the solution, the solid was obtained by recrystallization at 4. The sodium and copper salts NaxH4 _XPVMo1104o and Cu~,H4 _ Z,,PVMo11040 were obtained according to the procedure described by Tsigdinos [9]. The H+ ions were substituted by Na+ or Cu\" ions by simple treatment with aqueous solutions of sodium hydrocarbonate (NaHC03) and copper nitrate (Cu(N03)2) until the required exchange levels were reached. To avoid degradation with time, the solids were stored at 4. The heteropolyacid and the sodium and copper heteropoly salts supported on silica were prepared by impregnation of the support with a concentrated aqueous solution of these salts followed by filtration and drying at 120 for 12 h. The silica support consisted of cylindrical pellets having a 4.7 mm diameter and height. Its specific area was very low (less than 1 m2 g-'). Catalysts with weight ratio HPA/silica=0.4 were prepared. Oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA was carried out at 340 under continuous flow conditions in a stainless steel tube (150 cm long'and 2 cm2 section) at atmospheric pressure using a mixture of IBA, air, water and nitrogen with percentages and molar ratios: IBA = 5%, OZ/IBA=1.5, H20/IBA =2. The total flow-rate was 341.521 h-'. A. Aboukai's et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994)109-118 N~ r- air a C lBp+water Fig. 1. Schematic of experimental reactor system: (a) evaporator and mixer, (b) reactor, (c) thermocouple, (d) condensor, (e) column for gas washing, (f) condensed products and (g) gas products. The schematic equipment used in the IBA oxidation is illustrated in Fig. 1. Nitrogen was injected first into an evaporator heated at a constant temperature, followed by air. The desired mixtures of isobutyric acid and water (H20/IBA=2) were introduced thereafter by means of a pump. The flow from the evaporator could be passed directly to the reactor containing the catalysts. The reactor was vertically mounted and immersed in a dissolved KNOZ-KN03 salt bath. The catalyst occupying a volume of 150 cm3 or a height of 75 cm was held in the reactor by a grating. A thermocouple passing through the catalyst bed measured the temperature at different points of the reactor. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography and chemical analysis. This latter method consists of determining the total amount of acid in the solution by a simple neutralization with NaOH solution. Moreover, the amount of MAA formed after oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA was precisely determined by addition of Br2 molecules onto the double bond of the molecule concerned. After a stationary state had been reached in the oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA, the conversion was calculated as: Conv. -100 ~ [moles of IBA reacted/moles of IBA introduced] The number of IBA moles reacted or introduced through the reactor was determined per unit of time. 112 A. Aboukars et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 109-118 Selectivities of the various products formed were determined as: Sel. -100 - [moles of component i/moles of IBA reacted] The contact time was defined as: t,(h) = 1/VRH or tc(s) =3600/VRH where VRH (volumetric rate per hour) is the ratio of the total flow-rate per hour over the volume occupied by the catalyst. For all the catalytic tests, the contact time was taken as being equal to 1.80 s and VRH = 2000 h -' . The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E 109 spectrometer at 9.3 GHz. The magnetic field was modulated at 100 kHz. Precise g values were obtained by comparison with a \"strong pitch\" value (g = 2.0028) . 3. Results and discussions 3.1. H4PVMoQplsilica Fig. 2 shows the variation in the catalytic activity and selectivity of HQPVMOt 1040/silica as a function of the elapsed time of reaction in the oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA at 340. The products formed during this reaction were MAA, acetone, propene, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. For a period of 15 days, the conversion of IBA was 94-95% and the selectivity to MAA was about 70%. The selectivity to acetone and propene also remained almost constant at 12-14%. 1 a b 60 40 20 c 0~ 16 15days Fig. 2.

Na.H4_,,PVMojlO4dsilica When the protons in H4PVMo,t04o were replaced by Na+ ions (Nax.H4_xPVMo,t04o), the catalytic activity and selectivity of solids decreased even at low sodium content. Indeed, for x = 0.185, the activity and the selectivity to MAA decreased from 91 and 75% to 67 and 42ss'o respectively after 12 days of catalysts' work. 3.3. CuyH4_2yPVMol,04dsilica Fig. 3 displays the variation of the activity and selectivity of CuyH4_Z,PVMo,t04o with the copper content. If for y=0.3, the activity reaches a maximum (98ssb), on the contrary, the maximum of the selectivity (75-76ssb) is obtained when y=0.5. Compared to H4PVMo,t04o, the Cuo.3H3.4PVMo1104o and Cuo.5H3PVMot,04o catalysts exhibit a better performance in the conversion of IBA and in the selectivity to MAA. These catalysts remained stable after 4 to 6 weeks of catalytic work (Fig. 4) . 3.4. Thermal analysis results It has been demonstrated by differential thermal analysis (DTA) that the copper-based catalysts are more stable than the sodium-based catalysts toward the thermal treatment under a flow of nitrogen [ 10] . Indeed, in DTA measurements, exothermic peaks appear at 433 and 406 respectively for the Cuo.sH3PVMott04o and Na,.A.5PVMo1104o catalysts. These peaks can be attributed to an irreversible evolution of the catalyst structure. In addition, results obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) show that orthorhombic Mo03 [ 11 ] is detected in both samples above 440. From the above results it is obvious to conclude that the presence of Cu\" ions in H4PVMo,104o stabilizes more this solid in the catalytic conditions and enhances markedly the conversion of IBA and the selectivity to MAA whereas, the presence of Na+ counterions instead of copper ions inhibits their catalytic activity and selectivity. The results obtained with the copper-based catalysts are quite similar to those obtained in the literature [8]. 114 A. Aboukais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General Ill (1994) 109-118 100 80 60- 40- 1 2 O 40 dap Fig. 4. Development of the activity (a) and selectivities to MAA (b), acetone (c), propene (d) and CO +CO, (e) versus the reaction time for CusH3PVMo,catalyst. It has been suggested [ 12] that the replacement of one or two protons by counter-cations in H4PVMo,tO40 produces oxygen vacancies which are obtained by reaction, in the 200 and 400 temperature range, of the lattice oxygen of the heteropolyacid and the acidic protons. In fact, the calcination treatment at 320 leads to the formation of water which desorbs from the solid with a significant modification of the Keggin structure. The changes of the Keggin Units in the 200-400 temperature range has been characterized by IR [ 13 ] . In fact, after calcination of the sodium as well as the copper salts at 320, IR spectra characteristic of PM0120to anions were detected, suggesting that the vanadium ions are ejected from the Keggin structure. This change is reversible with rehydration, but the reversibility seems to improve when copper is present in the heteropoly compounds [ 14 ] . Ai [ 15] has studied, for 12-molybdophosphoric acid (H3PMo,2040), the effects of the type and amount of a canon introduced into the solid on its function as acid catalyst, its reducibility and re-oxidizability, its oxidation activity and its thermal stability. He demonstrated that the electronegativity of the canon is closely correlated to the catalytic activity of the solid and that the alkali metals are restricted by their deleterious effect on the activity. Since the Cu2+ ions are more electronegative than the Na+ ions, it seems that the formation of oxygen vacancies in the heteropolyacid occurs more easily in the presence of copper than in the presence of sodium. The simultaneous presence in the solid of acidic protons and oxygen vacancies with adequate ratios are probably correlated with the activity and selectivity and/or the thermal stability. Indeed, for the high copper content (y > 0.5) in Cu,H4_2vPVMo4,, the Bronsted acidity of the solid becomes weaker, leading to a decrease of the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Moreover, when the protons are replaced by Na+ ions, these latter canons are not able, as in the case of Cu' + ions, to form a sufficient number of oxygen vacancies in the catalytic stationary state. Taking this assumption into account, it is possible to explain why the activity and the selectivity of NaxH4_xPVMo4o catalysts decrease with time when compared to those obtained with HQPVMo4o and Cu4_2VMoao catalysts.

EPR spectra, recorded at room temperature, of Cuo,5H3PVMo,o calcined under dried air at different temperatures: (a) room temperature, (b) 200 and (c) 320. In order to explain why the activity of Cu' vH4_z,,PVMot,04, reaches its maximum for y=0.5, an EPR study was carried out on the solids before and after the catalytic reaction. Fig. 5 shows the EPR spectra obtained on the above catalyst versus the calcination temper ature from room temperature to 320 under a dry air flow. The spectra are characteristic of a d9-like ion (gn > g1 > ge ) and can be assigned to isolated Cuz+ ions by comparing with spectra of such species in the same matrices [ 1,16,17] . The EPR parameter values of spectra change with the calcination temperature. The splitting constant Al decreases from 120 to 110 G and the g,, tensor increases from 2.415 to 2.430, when the calcination temperature changes from room temperature to 320. From these values and according to the Peisach-Blumberg plots [ 18], the Cu2+ ions in the untreated solid are surrounded by more ligands than those in the solid calcined at 320. The values of these parameters indicate that CU2+ ions are either in distorted octahedral symmetry [ 19,20], with a ligand coordination number less than six, or in square-pyramidal symmetry [21 ]. Moreover, the signal intensity decreases and a broad signal (giso=2.13; dHpp=245 G) appears with increasing calcination temperature. This phenomenon can be explained by the formation of Cu2+ ion clusters in the catalyst [ 16]. The decrease of the resolved signal intensity and the appearance of the broad signal became more important when the copper concentration in the solid increased. Therefore the formation of cupric clusters seems to be correlated to the diminution of the catalyst activity; particularly when the concentration of copper (y) is higher than 0.5. Moreover, it has been proved [ 13 ] that calcination at 320 of H4PVMo1104o catalysts strongly modifies the structure of the solids. Indeed, the calcined solids exhibit IR spectra characteristic of PM012040 anions, i.e. the vanadium ions are ejected from the Keggin structure. Furthermore, on H4PVMo1104o and Cu,,H4 _ Z,,PVMo,104o catalysts, 51 V solidstate NMR spectra of tetrahedral V5+ species are detected, whereas the initial octahedral V5+ ions signal drops drastically [6,22]. So V5+ counter-cations are present, in addition to Cu\" ions and residual protons, in the calcined state of those catalysts. Furthermore, after the catalytic reaction, V4+ ions in tetrahedral and octahedral symmetry are also detected by EPR [23] on H4PVMo11040. The V4+ counter-cations are stable in the catalytic conditions. 116 A. Aboukais et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 111 (1994) 109-118 2 P~028 92,088 X1,985 2ooG Fig. 6. EPR spectrum, recorded at room temperature, of Cuo.sH3PVMo,o after the catalytic reaction. Fig. 6 shows the EPR spectrum of Cuo.5H3PVMoo after the catalytic reaction (40 days). The spectrum which is apparently a superposition of two signals (gc2.088; gv=1.985) which can be attributed [24] to the simultaneous presence of Cu\" and V4+ ions in specific interaction. Furthermore, the above discussion concerning the correlation between counter-cations and oxygen vacancies must be completed by considering also the role of the vanadium. As a matter of fact, it has recently been shown [ 25 ] that in Cuo.5V205 and NaV205 compounds, the presence of copper leads to more instability of the oxygen atoms in the V205 lattice than sodium does. In fact, `V solid state NMR of Nat.5H2.5PVMott040 calcined up to 400 evidenced that vanadium(V) ions remain in octahedral symmetry and sodium inhibits the lacunar structure of vanadium ions [6] . Furthermore, in the case of Ctto.5V205 the oxygen instability appears to be directly correlated with the selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of 2-propanol. A similar effect can be involved in CuvH4 _ ZvPVMot ,040 heteropoly compounds, because the copper-vanadium counter-cations interaction could also modify the instability of the oxygen atoms in the Keggin structure. 3.5. Effect of water on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts In order to study the influence of water in the oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA, we have turned off the water on the Cufl.5H3PVMot,040 catalyst after six weeks on stream. The conversion of IBA drastically decreased from 93% to 72%, whereas the selectivity to MAA diminished from 73% to 65%. When the water was reintroduced onto the catalyst, its activity and selectivity increased (88 and 70% respectively) but did not reach the initial values. This non-reversibility can be due either to some inhibiting defects created in the solid after the short break in the water supply or to an ageing of the catalyst after six weeks on stream. The water /IBA ratios in this reaction should be chosen around 2. Any variation of this ratio leads to a significant change in activity and selectivity of the catalyst. It has been demonstrated [ 26-29 ] that for the oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA over heteropolyacid catalysts water has different effects on the catalyst activity. It hinders the adsorption of the reactant IBA but, on the other hand, accelerates the desorption of the products out of the oxygen vacancies (reduced sites). Consequently, the deactivation of catalysts as a result of the absence of water in the reaction can be due to the adsorption of IBA and/or MAA on the reduced sites of the catalysts. When the IBA/water ratio is lower than 1, the presence of A. Aboukafs er al. /Applied Catalysis A: General]]] (1994)109-118 117 excess water can inhibit the reaction by reducing the number of available sites due to the strong adsorption of water [ 29 ] . 4. Conclusion The presence of copper in the heteropoly compounds leads to the formation of stable oxygen vacancies whereas sodium inhibits that. The simultaneous presence in the solid of acidic protons and oxygen vacancies correlated with Cu2+ and V counter-cations with a suitable ratio is probably responsible for performance as regards the activity and selectivity of the copper-based catalysts. The presence of water (IBA/water=2) during the reaction is necessary to maintain a stable content of oxygen vacancies as active sites in the catalysts.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid (MAA) was studied over the heteropolyacid H4VMo11O40 and the acidic salts NaxH4-xPVMo11O40 and CuyH4-2yPVMo11O4. supported on silica, as catalysts. The presence of copper as counter-cations in the heteropoly compounds increases the activity and the selectivity to MAA. This increase is probably due to the simultaneous presence in the solids of Brønsted acidity and oxygen vacancies with an adequate ratio. These latter sites can more easily be obtained in the presence of Cu2+ and V4+ than with Na+ counter-ions in the catalysts.
