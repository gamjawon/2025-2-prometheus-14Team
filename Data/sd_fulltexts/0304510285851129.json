In the absence of acetone, the products were purely formaldehyde (and its dimethyl acetal) and dihydrogen in the wavelength range of 260 - 440 nm, although quantum efficiency was rather low (0.1 - 7 X 10~3). Addition of acetone accelerated the rate of dihydrogen evolution (still >95% of the gas- phase components), whereas formaldehyde, formaldehyde dimethyl acetal, ethylene glycol, 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol, 2-propanol and 2-methyl-l,2- propanediol were found in the liquid phase with a satisfactory mass balance for hydrogen. In comparison with the purely acetone-photosensitized reaction of methanol, the rhodium catalyst facilitates the formation of formaldehyde (and its dimethyl acetal) over all the wavelengths studied (260 - 440 nm). In the wavelength range where acetone is a strong absorber of photons (<312 nm), the rhodium catalyst is considered to convert 'CH20H radicals into formaldehyde and dihydrogen. The enhanced formal- dehyde formation in the wavelength range where acetone is a very poor absorber of photons (>338 nm) suggests participation of a possible rhodium-acetone complex in the photoexcitation processes. The fact that the ratio of the amounts of products [ethylene glycol] [2,3-dimethyl- 2,3-butanediol]/[2-methyl-l,2-propanediol]2, is constant independent of the wavelength, indicates that these three products are formed from the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling of \"CH20H and 'C(CH3)2(OH) radicals irrespective of the presence of the rhodium catalyst. Introduction In our previous paper [I], we reported that cis-[Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2] (dpm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and [Pd2Cl2(dpm)2] were effective *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 302 catalysts for liquid-phase dehydrogenation of methanol under photoirradia- tion (high-pressure mercury lamp), where addition of acetone remarkably accelerated the rate. In contrast to a simple acetone-photosensitized reac- tion of methanol, the product distribution is quite unique since (1) the gas-phase product is almost purely dihydrogen (vs. mainly methane) and (2) formation of formaldehyde and its dimethyl acetal is greatly enhanced (vs. largely 2-methyl-l,2-propanediol and ethylene glycol). While the palladium catalyst showed a sigmoidal time dependence of activity, with an induction period, the rhodium catalyst exhibited stationary activity from the beginning. The latter is thus more appropriate for mechanistic study. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction with the rhodium catalyst, we have investigated here the rate, product distribution and quantum efficiency with varying acetone concentrations as well as varying wavelengths of incident photons. Experimental All the reagents and solvents were reagent grade. Methanol was dried with Molecular Sieve 3A. Cis-[Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2] was prepared by the literature method [2]. The methanol solution containing an appropriate amount of catalyst was deaerated with bubbling argon before the reaction. The reactor was equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser to which a gas buret was attached. When refluxing of the solution became stable, volumetry of the gas phase was started. Photoirradiation was carried out with a high- pressure mercury lamp (400 W, Riko Kagaku) through a Pyrex-glass vessel placed inside the reactor. The dependence on the wavelength was determined with a spectro- photometric reactor (Jasco CRM-FA; diffraction grating type; 2 kW xenon arc-lamp), where the wavelength range of 208 - 696 nm was divided into twenty equal portions. Appropriate wavelengths were chosen taking into account both the emission characteristics of the lamp and the absorption properties of the reaction solution (260 - 440 nm, shown by the center of the portions). For each of the portions, a standard 1-cm pathlength quartz cell was set, into which 4.0 ml of the solution was charged beforehand (deaerated and sealed with a Teflon cap). The temperature was maintained at 20.0 0.1 C. Gas chromatographic analysis was done using the following stationary phases: (1) Molecular Sieve 5A and Unibeads IS for gas-phase components, and (2) Porapak-N and PEG 1000 for low- and high-boiling components in the liquid phase, respectively. Quantitative analysis of formaldehyde was performed by means of a colorimetric method [3] or gas chromatography with an integrated hydrogenation reactor [4]. Electronic absorption spectra were measured with a recording spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-365) at ambient temperature. 303 Results and discussion Table 1 presents the rate of Ha formation for the liquid-phase photo- catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol with varying amounts of acetone added; the gas phase product was almost purely H; for all the runs (CH4 < 5%). There is a tendency for the rate to increase with increasing amounts TABLE 1 Initial rate of H^ formation for the liquid-phase photocatalytic dehydrogenation of methanol with cis-[RhtCl^(CO)^(dpm)i'i complex in the presence of acetone'1 Run Rate (mmol h~1) Methanol (ml) Acetone (ml) 1 2\" 3 4 400 450 480 495 100 50 20 5 2.45 2.61 1.97 0.91 \"Photou-radiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp (400 W) at 64 C (refluxing).

The small discrepancy between runs No. 1 and 2 may be due to the presence of too much acetone in the former (absorbance at 313 nm: 3.21), which would limit the light absorption to the vicinity of the entrance end of the optical path. The reciprocal of the rate correlates approximately linearly with the reciprocal of the acetone concentration. In the liquid phase, formaldehyde (1), formaldehyde dimethyl acetal (2), ethylene glycol (3), 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol (4), 2-propanol (5) and 2-methyl-l,2-propanediol (6) were detected as products, which are classified formally according to Scheme 1 from the viewpoint of mass balance for hydrogen. Quantitative analyses of the amounts formed gave the product distribution as tabulated in Table 2. The reaction times were chosen so that the amount of 1 + 2 exceeded =;5 mmol. In view of the error limit ($3%) in analyzing each product, the postulated stoichio- metry of hydrogen seems satisfactory. It is noteworthy that the observed product distribution is quite different from that of the acetone-photo- sensitized reaction of methanol (Table 3). It is evident from Table 2 that when the amount of acetone is small (run No. 4), selectivity to 1 + 2 over 3 becomes high (68%) with concomi- tant lowering of the contributions of 4, 5 and 6. On the other hand, in runs No. 1-3, 3 is preferentially formed (=:60%) over 1+2, and the formation of the products involving hydrogen transfer from methanol to acetone is pronounced (4,5,6). As photoirradiation was carried out with a high-pressure mercury lamp through Pyrex glass, photoexcitation of acetone should occur at ~313 nm. Around this wavelength, however, photons are absorbed competitively 304 Dihydrogen Releasing Reaction CHaOH > Hz + HCHO 1 SCHaOH > Ha + CHaCOCHa); + HzO 2 2CH30H > Ha + HOCHjCHaOH 3 Dihydrogen Accepting Reaction 2(CH3)2CO + H2 > HOC(CH3)2C(CH3)20H 4 (CH3)2CO + H; > (CH3)2CHOH 5 Hydrogen Transfer Reaction CHsOH + (CH3)2CO > HOCH2C(CH3)20H 6 Scheme 1 by acetone and the rhodium complex. Since the catalyst concentration was constant (0.05 mM) all through the runs, the proportion of the photons absorbed by acetone decreases in the order run No. 1 through run No. 4. Actually, when the value of A (acetone)/{A (acetone) +A(complex)} (A: absorbance at 313 nm) is evaluated with the complex dissolved in methanol (after 8 h photoirradiation), we obtained 0.88, 0.79, 0.60 and 0.28 for runs No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Thus, the selectivity to form 1+2 may be correlated with the photoexcitation of the complex itself. In order to clarify this point, we have investigated the wavelength dependence of this photoreaction. As a blank experiment, the photo- reaction without rhodium complex (purely acetone-photosensitized reaction) was performed. In accordance with the absorption properties of acetone, reaction was observed below X = 338 nm. The product distribution is presented in Table 4. As for the conversion of methanol, the yield of 1 + 2 is very low in comparison with 3. It is notable that the ratio [3][4]/[6]2 is constant over the wavelength range studied. This feature would suggest that these three products were formed from the homogeneous (3, 4) and heterogeneous (6) coupling of 'CH^OH and 'C(CH3)2(OH) radicals. The quantum efficiency was determined as in Table 5. Taking into consideration the range of estimated errors (5 - 20%), it seems reasonable that this photoreaction shows little dependency on the wavelength. 1 co .a (0 ^ t~ ^ 00 ^ + 1 CO CO CM CO 10 i-l .3 W CO 0 (0 10 N ss Tf 1-1 I-l 00 ^ t010 ^( CO ^ CO g + CO 10 CC CO V (0 \"3, 1-1 d d d d 1 IL- i i 4-i rtl ^ ^ T-i /-^ 0 ^-^ < < w ssj o iq >o co csi 0, 0 CO + + Mt-1 + 0 ^1 10 00Tf <(< CO t0 N la yd o c~ co -^g --^ CSI CSI CO CO j3 ^ ^ ^ 3 i-l d d d d B 0 0 ffi -w'NG x 2^'s CO ^^ t~ ^ 10 ^^to to t~ ^f ^r co N r Tr -^ N ss or- ^1 <\" <;)' co ti (D 01 ^ i-i ^ B <f i t UB a <i1 a u g 5 \" a i-l .- 10 ^ 0 -^ i 1 e S TO t- t~ 0r-i l-i >0' Oi C<1 W >-1 ^s 2 .0 CO ^1 i-l C<1 0 (0 i-l CO i-l i-l 01 <0 f ^f CO CS) 01 CSI l.g 9 ^- ' as sV /110 t~ t~ 0 0f-' c~ d d &-13^ Sa.

In our previous paper [I], we reported that photoirradiation gradually caused the absorbance range of the rhodium complex to expand into the visi- ble region. Preliminary experiments indicated that the deeply colored solu- tion thus formed exhibited higher photocatalytic activity, especially in the visible region. For this reason, wavelength dependence was determined for the rhodium-containing solution, using the rhodium complex pre-activated in methanol by photoirradiation (6 h) with a high-pressure mercury lamp. The product distribution and the quantum efficiency are shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. It can clearly be seen that upon the addition of the rhodium complex, longer wavelengths (X > 364 nm) became effective for photocatalysis. Remarkably, the product is solely 1 + 2 in this wave- length region. It was further ascertained that when the rhodium complex (pre- activated) was used as the photocatalyst without acetone, the liquid-phase product was also 1+2 alone for the entire wavelength range (Table 8), although the quantum efficiency is rather low. Since the ratio [3][4]/[6]2 (Table 6) is again constant for 260 nm < X < 338 nm within experimental error, the radical coupling mechanism would operate also in this case for the corresponding C C bond formation. 307 TABLE 6 Wavelength dependence of the product distribution for methanol dehydrogenation with cis-[Rh2Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2 ] complex in the presence of acetone1 X 1+23 4 5 6 [3][4]/[6]2 (nm) 260 44.3 132.3 7.33 45.1 111.8 0.0776 286 50.4 718.9 76.46 778.2 837.6 0.0784 312 127.5 1364 107.6 898.3 1377 0.0768 338 70.2 72.44 1.09 trace 31.96 0.0774 364 3.8 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 390 1.6 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 414 2.6 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 440 2.2 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 - \"Amount formed (in jumol) (20 C, 20 h).

Values in parentheses are those obtained using the absorbance before reaction. Another notable effect of the addition of the rhodium complex is that the yield of 1 + 2 was greatly enhanced (260 nm < X < 338 nm) relative to other products (Tables 4 and 6). Since the photoexcitation of the rhodium complex itself leads to the formation of 1 + 2 with relatively low quantum efficiency (Table 8), it seems reasonable to assume the conversion of 'CHaOH into 1 and Hz, which may be catalyzed by the rhodium complex. The half-wave potentials (Ei/^) of the hydroxymethyl radical ('CH^OH) for one-electron oxidation and one-electron reduction are 0.98 and 1.8 V (us. SCE), respectively [5]. Electrochemical study of cis-[Rh^Cl-i(CO)r (dpm);] has not yet been carried out, but a similar dpm-bridged dinuclear Rh(I) complex [RhaC'BuNC^dpm);]2\"1\" is reported to possess J?% of 0.57 V for oxidation (Rha2\"*\" -> Rha3\"1\") and ca. 1.4 V for reduction (us. SCE) [6]. The latter value is within the range of one-electron reduction potentials for various mononuclear Rh(I) complexes [E^ ^ 1.2~ 2.7 V us. SCE) [7-10]. Therefore 'CHaOH seems to be incapable of either reducing ( 0.98 > 1.4) or oxidizing (0.57 > 1.8) Rh(I) by a simple one-electron transfer process. In fact, no precipitation of metallic rhodium was observed even after prolonged photoirradiation (70 h). The catalytic action of the dinuclear rhodium complex (as well as the rhodium cluster which appears to accumulate slowly as the photochemical reaction proceeds [1]) for the conversion of 'CH^OH into 1 and H; may lie in the facility of rhodium for complexing with hydride ligand [II], and the associated flexibility of valency for the Rhn (n> 2) unit. It was pointed out that the thermal reaction of [Rh2(l,3-diisocyanopropane)4]2'1' with HC1 led to the formation of a mixed-oxidation-state oligomer (Rh4- Cl;4'1\") accompanying H; evolution [12]. For X = 338 nm, the amount of 1 + 2 formed is particularly large, and is comparable to that of 3. Around this wavelength, photons are absorbed mainly by the complex (A(acetone)/{A(acetone) +A(complex)} = 0.03 at 338 nm), as reflected in the relatively low yield of radical coupling 309 products (Tables 6 and 7). In view of the low quantum efficiency (Table 8), however, the amount formed seems inexplicable from the photoexcitation of the complex, at least in the form existing in the methanol solution. The quantum efficiency at X > 364 nm for the formation of 1 + 2 is also notice- ably greater in the presence of acetone (Table 7) than in the absence of acetone (Table 8). Since simple ketones are known to coordinate to transi- tion metals [13 -15], it seems reasonable to ascribe the observed composite effect (complex + acetone) to the formation of a rhodium-acetone adduct which is responsible for the enhanced photocatalysis forming 1+2. In conclusion, the rhodium complex is quite unique in forming 1 (+2) with =il00% selectivity by visible-light irradiation. The possibility is suggested for enhancing its photocatalytic activity by means of complex formation with additives. In a system where photosensitization of acetone prevails, the control of selectivity, to obtain either 1 (+2) or 3 exclusively, would be desired. References 1 H. Yamamoto, S. Shinoda and Y. Saito, J.

The half-wave potentials (Ei/^) of the hydroxymethyl radical ('CH^OH) for one-electron oxidation and one-electron reduction are 0.98 and 1.8 V (us. SCE), respectively [5]. Electrochemical study of cis-[Rh^Cl-i(CO)r (dpm);] has not yet been carried out, but a similar dpm-bridged dinuclear Rh(I) complex [RhaC'BuNC^dpm);]2\"1\" is reported to possess J?% of 0.57 V for oxidation (Rha2\"*\" -> Rha3\"1\") and ca. 1.4 V for reduction (us. SCE) [6]. The latter value is within the range of one-electron reduction potentials for various mononuclear Rh(I) complexes [E^ ^ 1.2~ 2.7 V us. SCE) [7-10]. Therefore 'CHaOH seems to be incapable of either reducing ( 0.98 > 1.4) or oxidizing (0.57 > 1.8) Rh(I) by a simple one-electron transfer process. In fact, no precipitation of metallic rhodium was observed even after prolonged photoirradiation (70 h). The catalytic action of the dinuclear rhodium complex (as well as the rhodium cluster which appears to accumulate slowly as the photochemical reaction proceeds [1]) for the conversion of 'CH^OH into 1 and H; may lie in the facility of rhodium for complexing with hydride ligand [II], and the associated flexibility of valency for the Rhn (n> 2) unit. It was pointed out that the thermal reaction of [Rh2(l,3-diisocyanopropane)4]2'1' with HC1 led to the formation of a mixed-oxidation-state oligomer (Rh4- Cl;4'1\") accompanying H; evolution [12]. For X = 338 nm, the amount of 1 + 2 formed is particularly large, and is comparable to that of 3. Around this wavelength, photons are absorbed mainly by the complex (A(acetone)/{A(acetone) +A(complex)} = 0.03 at 338 nm), as reflected in the relatively low yield of radical coupling 309 products (Tables 6 and 7). In view of the low quantum efficiency (Table 8), however, the amount formed seems inexplicable from the photoexcitation of the complex, at least in the form existing in the methanol solution. The quantum efficiency at X > 364 nm for the formation of 1 + 2 is also notice- ably greater in the presence of acetone (Table 7) than in the absence of acetone (Table 8). Since simple ketones are known to coordinate to transi- tion metals [13 -15], it seems reasonable to ascribe the observed composite effect (complex + acetone) to the formation of a rhodium-acetone adduct which is responsible for the enhanced photocatalysis forming 1+2. In conclusion, the rhodium complex is quite unique in forming 1 (+2) with =il00% selectivity by visible-light irradiation. The possibility is suggested for enhancing its photocatalytic activity by means of complex formation with additives. In a system where photosensitization of acetone prevails, the control of selectivity, to obtain either 1 (+2) or 3 exclusively, would be desired. References 1 H. Yamamoto, S. Shinoda and Y. Saito, J.

The nature and mechanisms of the photocatalysis of soluble cis-[Rh2-Cl2(CO)2(dpm)2] complex for the dehydrogenation of methanol have been examined with and without the presence of added acetone, by determining the rate of the reaction, product distribution and quantum efficiency. In the absence of acetone, the products were purely formaldehyde (and its dimethyl acetal) and dihydrogen in the wavelength range of 260 – 440 nm, although quantum efficiency was rather low (0.1 – 7 × 10−3). Addition of acetone accelerated the rate of dihydrogen evolution (still > 95% of the gas-phase components), whereas formaldehyde, formaldehyde dimethyl acetal, ethylene glycol, 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol, 2-propanol and 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol were found in the liquid phase with a satisfactory mass balance for hydrogen. In comparison with the purely acetone-photosensitized reaction of methanol, the rhodium catalyst facilitates the formation of formaldehyde (and its dimethyl acetal) over all the wavelengths studied (260 – 440 nm). In the wavelength range where acetone is a strong absorber of photons (⩽312 nm), the rhodium catalyst is considered to convert ·CH2OH radicals into formaldehyde and dihydrogen. The enhanced formaldehyde formation in the wavelength range where acetone is a very poor absorber of photons (⩾338 nm) suggests participation of a possible rhodium-acetone complex in the photoexcitation processes. The fact that the ratio of the amounts of products [ethylene glycol] [2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediol] /[2-methyl-1,2-propanediol]2, is constant independent of the wavelength, indicates that these three products are formed from the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling of ·CH2OH and ·C(CH3)2(OH) radicals irrespective of the presence of the rhodium catalyst.
