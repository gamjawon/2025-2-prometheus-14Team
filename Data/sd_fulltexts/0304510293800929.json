It can be produced in a variety of catalytic processes: (i) carbonylation of methanol, (ii) dehydrogenation of methanol, (iii) oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol, (iv) dimerization of formaldehyde, (v) direct synthesis from syngas, and (vi) hydrocondensation of carbon dioxide with methanol. The most common industrial technology is the carbonylation of methanol, eqn. (1) . CO+CH30H-,.HCOOCH3 dUR=-29.1 kJ mol The reaction is typically carried out at 80 C and 45 bar of carbon monoxide in the presence of an alkali methoxide catalyst ( KOCH3 or NaOCH3 ) [ 3 ] . Although very efficient, the catalyst is sensitive to even a trace amount of water or carbon dioxide. Recently, much research has been devoted to transition metal complex catalysts which could tolerate the poisons. The metals that have been studied are ruthenium [ 4-6 ] , platinum [ 7 ] and tungsten [ 8 ] . Yet, the rates of methanol carbonylation with these catalysts are much lower than those with alkali methosides. During a study of ruthenium-catalyzed carbonylation of methanol, we found that the rate of the reaction could be enhanced dramatically by adding *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

This letter reports effects of promoter and solvent with Ru3 (CO) 12 as the catalyst precursor. Furthermore, the deactivation behavior of this new transition metal catalyst system was compared with conventional alkali methoxides when H20 or COZ were added to the reaction mixture. Experimental A 300 cm3 high-pressure stirred autoclave with Hastelloy C walls (Parr) was employed as a batch reactor. The reactor was enclosed in an electric furnace regulated by a proportional-integral-differential temperature controller. A local thermocouple monitored the temperature of the reaction solution during the reaction. In a typical experiment, 0.133 Ool of Ru3 (CO) 12 (Aldrich), 0.2 g of a promoter, 0.2 g of a ligand, 50 ml of a solvent were mixed with methanol to make the total volume of 70 ml and charged into the reactor. While stirring, the gas phase in the reactor was flushed with carbon monoxide several times and then pressurized to 136 bar. The CO supply valve was left open throughout the reaction in order to maintain a constant CO pressure. The reactor was then heated and the time when the temperature reached the desired reaction temperature (200 C) was taken to be the start of the reaction (t=0). The reactor pressure increased to 200 bar by the heating. The stirring speed was 700 rpm for all experiments although the reaction was not affected when the speed was lowered to 300 rpm. The reaction mixture was sampled during the reaction for analysis. A gas chromatograph (HP 5890A) equipped with a 60 m DB-Wax column and a flame-ionized detector was employed and 1-butanol was used as an internal standard. Results and discussion Effects of promoter and solvent Ruthenium was chosen because previous studies in literature indicated that it was the most promising metal catalyst for methanol carbonylation to methyl formate [ 4-6 ] . The Ru3 (CO) 12 was employed as the catalyst precursor in all experiments. Analysis of liquid products indicated that methyl formate (MF) was the sole product. Since the conversions calculated from the disappearance of methanol and formation of MF agreed within 5% , the loss of methanol to gaseous products (mainly CH4 and C02) should be less than 5% and the selectivity of MF should be better than 95%. Hence, the gas phase composition was not quantified in this work. Figure 1 shows typical results of methanol conversion with reaction time. Since much data showed a concave curvature, the initial rates were calculated from the methanol conversion at 2 h. This curvature may indicate the presence S.J. Choi et al. / J. Mol.

We believe that the former is more likely because the concave curvature was not observed when alkali methogide catalysts were tested by the same procedure [ 7 ] . In all cases, the methanol conversion was less than 5% in order to avoid possible complications due to high conversions such as secondary reactions, reverse reactions, etc. Table 1 lists these initial rates under various conditions. With only Ru3 (CO )12, the reaction was very slow (Run 1) . The rate increased upon introducing a proper solvent (Run 2 ). As could be further seen in Run 7, all the promoting solvents contained nitrogen in their structure. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) was particularly effective. The addition of NEt4C1 as a promoter increased the rate further (Run 3). However, other onium halides and SnC12 inhibited the reaction. Typical ligands with strong electron donating ability showed a mild inhibition effect when employed together with NEt4Cl (Run 5) , and a strong one without it (Run 4) . From the screening works described above, an efficient catalyst system of Ru3 (CO) 12 with NEt4C1 as a promoter and NMP as a solvent was found. This Ru3 (CO) 12/NEt4C1/NMP system is compared in Table 2 with other transition metal catalyst systems reported in literature [5,6,8,9]. Although the reaction conditions are different, it is evident that our catalyst system is more active than other known systems. No liquid products other than MF were detected in our system indicating excellent selectivity. The catalyst system did not show any sign of deactivation for 6 h registering a turnover number (mol MF formed/ mol of Ru) of 2640. L112 S.J. Choi et al. / J. Mol.

In the transition metal catalyzed carbonylation of methanol to MF, it appears from Table 2 that the presence of a proper basic medium is required. For Ru3 (CO) 12, NMP was found to be the best medium followed by pyridine and formamides. In a similar Ru3 (CO )12 system, Jenner and Bitsi [ 5 ] reported that pyridine was slightly better than NMP. The difference may have arisen from the different amounts of base employed in the two studies. Our experiment used 50 ml of NMP for 13.3 ,umol of Ru3 (CO) 12 while the previous work of Jenner and Bitsi employed 2 ml of pyridine for 76 Ool of Ru3 (CO) 12. Furthermore, they observed that the performance of the catalyst depended strongly on the amount of the base. It is well known that strongly reducing hydridorutheniO species [ HRu3 (CO) 11 ] - is generated from Ru3 (CO) 12 in many basic media including NMP and the species could generate more reactive mononuclear Ru species [ HRu (CO )4 ] - [5,6,10-12 ] . These species could generate methoxy species S.J Choi et al. / J. Mol.

Once the CH30 - species is formed, it could turn on a catalytic cycle in a similar manner as in alkali methoxide catalyst systems [ 13 ] . The ligands such as phosphenes and phenanthroline were tried as promoters because RuC12 (PPh3 )3 was reported to promote hydrogen transfer from methanol to ketones [ 14 ] . No promoting effects were observed. The results, however, confirm the report of Jenner and Bitsi [ 5 ] in the more similar system. Although the origin of promotional effect by NEt4C1 is not clear yet, it is well known that halides (X) react rapidly with RU3 (CO) 12 to form anionic species [ Ru3 (X) CO), ] - (n =10,11) [ 15,16 ] . Its hydrido counterpart may be more effective than the species without Cl in methoxy ion formation due to increased hydrogen transfer ability [ 14 ] or stronger activity towards carbon monoxide [ 17 ] . Other halide compounds, NEt41 and NEt4Br are not effective at all. Effects of water and carbon dioxide Since our motivation in the study of transition metal complex catalysts lies in their potential resistance to poisoning by H20 or C02, the RU3 (CO) 12/ NEt4C1/NMP system was tested with these poisons added into the reaction solution (H20) or to the gas phase (C02). Figure 2 shows that addition of water in large proportion to Ru3 (CO) 12 reduces the rate significantly. However, when the amount of water was comparable to the amount of catalysts, the deactivation was not significant as shown in Fig. 3. This provides a marked contrast to the conventional NaOCH3 catalyst system in which water poisons the catalyst on a one-to-one basis. In the transition metal catalyst system, it appears that water slows down the reaction rate by competing with reactants for vacant ligand sites of the metal complex. It should also be noted that the alkali methoxide system showed higher rate in the absence of the poison under much milder reaction conditions. Figure 4 shows the effect of C02. Overall trend was similar to the case of water. However, the deactivation by C02 was L114 -e -10 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.3 IH2011 WT % 0 700 S.J. Choi et al. / J. Moi.

Namely, deactivation by H20 was ca. 20 times greater than by C02- Conclusions Various promoters and solvents were studied to enhance the catalytic activity of Ru3 (CO) 12 for carbonylation of methanol to form methyl formate. As a result, an efficient Ru3 (CO) 12 catalyst system with NEt4Cl as a promoter and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as a solvent was established which exhibited a turnover rate higher than those of other transition metal catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, the catalyst system was much more resistant to poisoning by H20 and C02 compared to conventional alkali methoxide catalysts. References 1 J.S. Lee, J.C. Kim and Y.G. Kim, Appl.
