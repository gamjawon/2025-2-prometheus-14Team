Keywords: MCMâ€�22 zeolite Magnesium oxide Impregnation Acidâ€�base bifunction Knoevenagel condensation reaction Â 1. Introduction The Knoevenagel condensation reaction is one of the most useful routes for the synthesis of C=C bonds [1], and has been used to prepare coumarin and its derivatives [2] and cinnamic acid [3]. The reaction has found wide applications in organic synthesis. It is mainly performed using a carbonyl compound and an active methylene compound in the presence of a basic catalyst. Since Hein et al. [4] reported that the Knoevenagel condensation reaction was catalyzed cooperatively by acidic and basic active sites, acidâ€�base bifunctional catalysts with good dispersion of active centers and high catalytic activities have received much attention [5â€“9]. Climent et al. [10] hold that the catalytic activities of catalysts with suitable acidâ€�base pairs are better than those of strong solid basic catalysts. Peng et al. [11] prepared a controllable acidâ€�base bifunctionalized catalyst via inâ€�situ cleavage of sulfonamide bonds. The catalyst exhibited good performances in catalyzing Knoevenagel conâ€� densation reactions. Postole et al. [12] studied the reaction over acidâ€�base bifunctional nanocrystalline CexZr1â€�xO2 solid solutions and further demonstrated that the Knoevenagel condensation reaction was cooperatively catalyzed by acidic and basic sites. Alkalineâ€�earthâ€�metal oxides are good solid basic catalysts. The alkalinities of the catalyst are enhanced by modification with alkalineâ€�earthâ€�metal oxides and these catalysts have good catalytic activities and selectivities [13,14]. MCMâ€�22 molecular sieves, which have a high Si/Al ratio, have good thermal and hydrothermal stabilities, adjustable acidity, a high specific surâ€� face area, and a supercage structure [15â€“17]. They have the potential for use in a broad range of industrial applications. In * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 3, March 2013 ZHANG Wenfei et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 559â€“566 the present work, MgO is used to adjust the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, and an acidâ€�base bifunctional catalyst, MgO/HMCMâ€�22, is prepared by impregnation. The effects of the reaction conditions on Knoevenagel condensation reactions are also investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Naâ€�MCMâ€�22 zeolites with Si/Al = 30 were synthesized using a previously reported method [18]. The ammonium form was prepared by ionâ€�exchange for 2 h at 80 Â°C with a 1.0 mol/L NH4NO3 solution. The resulting material was filtered, washed, and dried. The NH4â€�MCMâ€�22 zeolite was then calcined at 550 Â°C for 5 h. The above procedures were repeated three times and the HMCMâ€�22 zeolite was obtained. HMCMâ€�22 was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)2 and dried with stirring at 80 Â°C, further dried for 4 h at 110 Â°C, and calcined at 550 Â°C for 5 h. MgO/HMCMâ€�22 cataâ€� lysts were obtained. The catalysts MgO/NaMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 were also prepared for comparison. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer, using a Cu KÎ± radiation source at 40 kV and 40 mA, in the 2Î¸ range 5Â°â€“80Â° at a scanning speed of 5Â°/min. N2 physical adsorptionâ€�desorption measureâ€� ments were carried out on a Chembetâ€�3000 instrument. Before the measurements, the catalysts were placed in a vacuum for 4 h at 350 Â°C. The morphologies of the catalysts were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using QUANTA200 instruments, after each treatment. Fourierâ€�transform infrared (FTâ€�IR) spectra were obtained using a Nexus 870 FTIR specâ€� trometer. Samples were mixed and ground with KBr for measâ€� urements in the range 4000â€“400 cmâ€“1, with a resolution of 4 cmâ€“1. The acidities and basicities of the catalysts were measâ€� ured by NH3 and CO2 temperatureâ€�programmed desorption (NH3â€�TPD and CO2â€�TPD), respectively, using an Autochem 2910 instrument connected to a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3. Knoevenagel condensation reaction The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate was carried out in a 50â€�ml threeâ€�necked flask attached to a reflux condenser. In a typical run, benzaldeâ€� hyde (50.0 mmol), ethyl cyanoacetate, and catalyst (cataâ€� lyst/reactants = 0.03, mass fraction) were added to the reaction mixture, and ethanol (10.0 ml) was mixed in the reactor as the solvent. The reaction was carried out at 80 Â°C (or another temâ€� perature, as discussed later) for the required time. The converâ€� sion of benzaldehyde was determined using a gas chromatoâ€� graph (SPâ€�6800A) equipped with a capillary column and a flame ionization detector. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst characterization results 3.1.1. XRD The XRD patterns of the catalysts (Fig. 1) show no signifiâ€� cant structural changes in MCMâ€�22 after MgO modification. The XRD pattern of MCMâ€�22 shows almost the same features as those described in [19]. Peaks arising from MgO are not obâ€� served, because MgO is highly dispersed. However, the crystalâ€� linity of the modified MCMâ€�22 decreases with increasing MgO loading. This reduction indicates that excessive MgO could block the pores of MCMâ€�22 [20]. The data in Table 1 show that the specific surface areas, miâ€� cropore areas, and pore volumes of the catalysts decrease obâ€� viously with increasing MgO loading. These characterization results also imply that a high content of MgO would cause parâ€� tial blockage of the pore system of MCMâ€�22. This is in agreeâ€� ment with the SEM images (Fig. 2), which reveal no aggregation on the MCMâ€�22 surface. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 (6) (5) (4) (3) (2) In te ns ity 2ï�±/( o ) (1) Fig. 1.

FTâ€�IR Figure 3 shows the FTâ€�IR spectra of the HMCMâ€�22 and MgO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts. The structure of MCMâ€�22 after MgO modification is retained. The peaks at 1090 and 1240 cmâ€“1 arise from the asymmetric stretching vibration of a TO4 tetraâ€� hedron. Slight decreases in the intensities of these bands are observed after modification as a result of MgO interacting with the framework of the MCMâ€�22 molecular sieves [21]. The symmetric stretching vibration of the TO4 tetrahedron is found at 804 cmâ€“1 and the peak at 457 cmâ€“1 is linked to the bending vibration of Tâ€“O. The bands at 559 and 607 cmâ€“1 are attributed to the dualâ€�ring vibration of the tetrahedral framework [22]. The region with wavenumbers less than 1250 cmâ€“1 is called the framework region [23]. The peak at 1640 cmâ€“1 is the bending mode of water molecules [24]. 3.1.3. CO2â€�TPD and NH3â€�TPD The CO2â€�TPD and NH3â€�TPD profiles of the MgO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The two desorption peaks repreâ€� sent weak and strong basic sites or weak and strong acidic sites, respectively. Increasing the MgO loading the strength and content of bases increase obviously. Siâ€“Oâ€“Mg is formed after modification. Lowâ€�coordinated Oâ€“ ions [25] can exhibit higher basicity. Obviously decreases the strength and content of strong acids; this is a result of MgO interacting with acidic sites [26]. The amount of weak acidic sites increases slightly, and this is ascribed to additional acidic sites after MgO modification because H+ ions of the hydroxide groups in the zeolite interact with MgO to form Mg(OH)+ [27]. As mentioned above, acidic and basic sites exist simultaneously on the catalysts. 3.2. Catalytic performance 3.2.1. Effects of MgO loading The effects of MgO loading on the catalytic activity are shown in Table 2. The highest conversion is observed over the MgO/HMCMâ€�22 catalyst with 8.0% MgO loading. The converâ€� sions only reach 84.4% and 6.6% over MgO/NaMCMâ€�22 and HMCMâ€�22, respectively. Interestingly, the combination of a functional HMCMâ€�22 zeolite with MgO resulted in a higher conversion than for MgO alone; 92.6% versus 72.5% after 2 h. This demonstrates that the introduction of MCMâ€�22 molecular sieves can promote the dispersion of MgO. In addition, acidic sites can be introduced to facilitate the Knoevenagel condensaâ€� tion reaction together with basic sites. From Table 2, it can be seen that the conversion of benzaldehyde first increases with increasing MgO content, but decreases when the content of MgO is more than 8.0%. This decrease could be caused by parâ€� tial blockage of the MCMâ€�22 pore system when the content of MgO is high, leading to a severe decrease in the surface area, micropore area, and pore volume [28], as shown in Table 1. 3.2.2. Effects of reaction conditions To check the effects of reaction time on the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, the reaction was carried out over 8%MgO/HMCMâ€�22 at 80 Â°C for different reaction times, rangâ€� ing from 1 to 6 h, as shown in Fig. 5(a). It was found that in the first 2 h of the reaction period, the conversion increases linearâ€� ly and reaches 92.6%, because the reaction is kinetically conâ€� trolled. The conversion levels off with further increases in the reaction time. The effects of the benzaldehyde/ethyl cyanoacetate molar ratio on the Knoevenagel condensation reaction are shown in Fig. 5(b). Little change is found at molar ratios below 1. The 4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 12 40 T ra ns m itt an ce Wavenumber (cmï€­1) (1) (2) 10 90 Fig. 3.

However, the conversion drops with further increasing in the molar ratio because excess benzaldehyde blocks some of the available active centers [21]. To optimize the reaction temperature to obtain maximum conversion, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction was carâ€� ried out at different temperatures, ranging from 20 to 80 Â°C, for 2 h. From Fig. 5(c), it can be seen that the conversion increases linearly up to 80 Â°C. At this temperature, ethanol can reflux fully to accelerate the reaction. Moreover, the carbanion interâ€� mediates generated in the reaction are stabilized by solvent molecules, promoting the reaction [29]. The effects of catalyst amount on the Knoevenagel condenâ€� sation reaction were studied by varying the amount of catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 5(d), increasing the amount of catalyst to 3.0% increases the converâ€� sion to 92.6%. The enhancement of the conversion can be atâ€� tributed to an increase in the number of catalytically active sites available for this reaction. The conversion remains almost steady for catalyst amounts above 3.0%. 3.3. Different Knoevenagel condensation over MgO/HMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts Because of its good catalytic activity in the reaction of benâ€� zaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate, the Knoevenagel condensaâ€� tion reactions of different active methylene compounds and aldehydes were carried out over the acidâ€�base bifunctional catalyst MgO/HMCMâ€�22, as shown in Table 3. The conversions of aldehydes are all above 92.5%. Malononitrile is found to be a better reagent than ethyl cyanoacetate, because of its better electronâ€�withdrawing ability. The catalytic activity of CaO/HMCMâ€�22 was also investigated and gave good results. The basic sites, as well as the acidic sites, play positive roles in promoting Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The acidâ€�base bifunctional MgO/HMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts, i.e., modified by alkalineâ€�earthâ€�metal oxides (MgO, CaO), are good catalysts for Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Corma [30] reported acidâ€�base cooperation for the Knoevenagel condensation reactions of carbonyl compounds with active methylenes via an ionâ€�pair mechanism. According to the results of our experiments and characterizations, MgO/HMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts exhibit obvious acidâ€�base synergetic effects in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. A possible mechanism of the Knoevenagel condensaâ€� tion reaction of a carbonyl compound with an active methylene is shown in Scheme 1. Basic sites abstract a proton from the methylene carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a carbanion. The carbonyl of the aldehyde is activated by acidic sites and a carbocation is generated. A dehydration reaction occurs by the carbanion attacking the carbocation.

Catalyst reusability As it is very convenient to recover the catalyst at the end of a reaction and recharge it for the next run, the MgO/HMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts were recycled by filtering, washâ€� ing, and drying, without any regeneration steps. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate was investigated over these catalysts. The results are listed in Table 4. The catalytic activity was stable after the third reaction run. The results indicate that there is a decrease in the activity after each use. This may be the result of deactivaâ€� tion of active centers resulting from complexation with both starting materials and products, or of microscopic changes in the structure of the catalyst [31]. 4. Conclusions Acidâ€�base bifunctional MgO/HMCMâ€�22 and CaO/HMCMâ€�22 catalysts were prepared using alkalineâ€�earthâ€�metal oxides (MgO, CaO), characterized, and used as efficient catalysts for Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The basicities of the catâ€� alysts increase when basic sites are introduced onto HMCMâ€�22. Acidic sites and basic sites are both significant for this reaction. The basic sites cooperate with the acidic sites, promoting the reaction. The present results suggest that these catalysts have acidâ€�base synergetic effects on the Knoevenagel condensation reactions of carbonyl compounds with active methylenes. The advantages of this method are mild reaction conditions, a simâ€� ple procedure, and a short reaction time. The conversions were all above 92.5% under the optimal conditions.

Tel: +86-25-83587167 MgO/HMCM-22 catalysts were prepared by impregnation and characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physical adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, and temperature-programmed desorption of CO2. The results show that there were no significant structural changes in the MCM-22 zeolite after modification. Increasing the MgO loading increased the strength and content of the base, whereas the strength of the strong acid decreased significantly and the amount of weak acidic sites increased slightly. Knoevenagel condensation reactions were carried out as the probe reactions over the catalysts. Both acidic sites and basic sites significantly promoted the reaction. The conversion of benzaldehyde reached 92.6% under the optimal conditions. The catalytic performance of MgO/HMCM-22 and MgO/NaMCM-22 was better than that of HMCM-22 and MgO. The MgO/HMCM-22 catalysts gave good catalytic performance for Knoevenagel condensation reactions and exhibited obvious acid-base synergetic effects. 摘要 ﻿采用浸渍法制备了一系列MgO改性催化剂MgO/HMCM-22, 利用X射线衍射、N2物理吸附-脱附、扫描电镜、傅里叶变换红外光谱、NH3及CO2程序升温脱附等技术对所制催化剂进行了表征. 结果表明, MgO改性后MCM-22分子筛仍保持原有的结构; 随着MgO负载量的增加, 催化剂的碱强度和碱含量显著增加, 而强酸含量明显减少, 弱酸酸位有所增加. 以Knoevenagel缩合为探针反应, 考察了所制催化剂的性能. 在优化的反应条件下, MgO/HMCM-22上苯甲醛转化率高达92.6%. 催化剂 MgO/HMCM-22和MgO/NaMCM-22的催化性能明显优于HMCM-22和MgO. 酸中心和碱中心均对该缩合反应起着重要的促进作用. MgO/HMCM-22对Knoevenagel缩合反应显示出较高的催化活性, 体现出明显的酸碱协同催化作用.
