Synthesis of Propylene Carbonate on a Bifunctional Titanosilicate Modified with Quaternary Ammonium Halides ZHANG Jing, LIU Yueming*, LI Ningning, WU Haihong, LI Xiaohong, XIE Wei, ZHAO Zhonglin, WU Peng # , HE Mingyuan Shanghai Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Chemical Processes, Department of Chemistry, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China Abstract: A novel bifunctional catalyst that exhibits catalytic activity for both the epoxidation of olefins and the carbonation of organic epoxides has been prepared through grafting quaternary ammonium halide on a titanosilicate. The one-pot synthesis of propylene carbonate from propylene, hydrogen peroxide, and carbon dioxide has been investigated. Delaminated titanosilicate with an open external surface is an excellent support for the immobilization of quaternary ammonium salts, and propyl tributyl ammonium halides are active functional species for the cycloaddition. The combination of delamination and functionalization leads to an active catalyst giving a yield of propylene carbonate as high as 48% and good stability and reusability. Key words: titanosilicate; phase delamination; quaternary ammonium halide; propylene carbonate; functionalization Cyclic carbonates are important chemicals in organic in- dustry. In particular, propylene carbonate (PC) is widely used in organic synthesis, cosmetics, gas separation, battery elec- trolytes, and metal extraction. Methods for the production of PC include phosgene synthesis, transesterification, chloro- hydrin process, and cycloaddition of propylene oxide (PO) with CO 2 , of which the cycloaddition is considered the most environmentally benign route (Scheme 1 reaction (1) step 2) [1]. Much work has been carried out on the addition of epox- ides with CO 2 to synthesize the corresponding cyclic carbon- ates using various catalysts such as organic bases [2], quater- nary ammonium salts, metal complexes [3], metal halides [4], MgO [5], MgO-Al 2 O 3 [6], KI/ZnO [7], KI/crown ether, KI/poly(ethylene glycol) [8], and ionic liquids [9]. However, the more efficient processes still use homogeneous catalysts that suffer from the difficulty of their reuse and separation and also a low catalytic activity. Until now, only few studies have dealt with one-step epoxidation and carbonation of olefins to carbonates, in which a physically mixed catalyst system con- taining titanosilicate and an organic base is commonly used [10–12]. There has been no report of a heterogeneous bifunc- tional catalyst that is efficient for the one-pot synthesis of carbonates. In this study, we synthesized a novel bifunctional catalyst by the grafting of quaternary ammonium halides (OEt) 3 Si(CH 2 ) 3 - N + Bu 3 Br − ) onto a delaminated titanosilicate (Del-Ti-MWW). The resulting material is catalytic for both epoxidation and carbonation, which was confirmed by the one-pot synthesis of Scheme 1. Synthesis of PC by the two-step method (1) and the one-step method (2). PO: Propylene oxide; PC: Propylene carbonate. ZHANG Jing et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(7): 589–591 carbonates without any additive. Ti-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized using a literature method [13]. Del-Ti-MWW was prepared from Ti-MWW by phase delamination [14]. In toluene solvent, Del-Ti-MWW was refluxed with (OEt) 3 Si(CH 2 ) 3 N + Bu 3 Br − (1.5 mmol/g) to obtain the quaternary ammonium-grafted material, Del-Ti-MWW- N + Bu 3 Br − . The results of X-ray diffraction and N 2 adsorption verified that the samples had good crystallinity, while UV-visible spectroscopy showed that the Ti species were tet- rahedrally coordinated in the framework. As shown in Fig. 1, the grafting modification resulted in IR bands at 2960 and 2880 cm −1 that were attributed to the stretching vibrations of CH 3 and CH 2 groups, respectively, and bands at 1468 and 1384 cm −1 due to the bending vibrations of CH 2 and CH 3 groups. CHN elemental analysis indicated that Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − contained 1.2 mmol/g organic groups. These results confirmed that the quaternary ammonium ions had been grafted onto the surface of Del-Ti-MWW successfully. For control experi- ments, Ti-MWW, TS-1, and Ti-β were also used to support (OEt) 3 Si-(CH 2 ) 3 N + Bu 3 Br − to prepare the corresponding qua- ternary ammonium-modified titanosilicates. Table 1 shows that after functionalization with quaternary ammonium, Del-Ti-MWW, Ti-MWW, and TS-1 were still active for the epoxidation of propylene with H 2 O 2 (Scheme 1 reaction (1) step 1) and showed a high utilization efficiency of H 2 O 2 . However, Ti-β with a 3-dimensional 12-membered ring (MR) channel showed a very low yield of PO because of its high hydrophilicity due to its polymorph structure. In the cycloaddition of PO and CO 2 (Scheme 1 reaction (1) step 2), PO was 100% converted over Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − to give 94% PC yield together with a small amount of the 1,2-propylene glycol byproduct as a result of the solvolysis of PO with water. However, on the other catalysts, particularly functionalized TS-1 and Ti-β, only a low PO yield was ob- tained. This is mainly because the ≡Si(CH 2 ) 3 N + Bu 3 Br − groups with a bulky molecular size can only be grafted onto the ex- ternal surface of the zeolites, which led to lower loadings on TS-1 and Ti-β (0.4 and 0.2 mmol/g, respectively). Ti-MWW with 12 MR side cups on the exterior surface was capable of accommodating more quaternary ammonium groups and Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − showed a higher PC yield than modified TS-1 and Ti-β. However, it was still less effective than Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − . The results indicated that in the design of a bifunctional epoxidation/carbonation catalyst, it is necessary to choose a titanosilicate with a large external sur- face area to enhance the oxidation activity and to accommodate a large quantity of bulky quaternary ammonium groups, i.e., the active sites for the carbonation. In the reaction of propyl- ene, H 2 O 2 , and CO 2 (one-pot), Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − also showed the highest catalytic activity with a PC yield of 48%. Although TS-1-N + Bu 3 Br − showed a relatively high activity for step 1 of reaction (1), it was less active for the cyclic carbona- tion in step 2 and gave a PC yield of only 5%. The used Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − catalyst was collected by filtration and regenerated by washing with ether and drying at 373 K. It was then reused in step 2 and the one-pot reaction (2). In the addition reaction of PO and CO 2 , the PC yield was al- most the same (> 90%) after it was reused four times, which indicates a high stability of the quaternary ammonium ions attached to the surface of the titanosilicate. Table 2 shows the activity of Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − reused in the one-pot re- action. In the second catalytic cycle, its activity clearly de- creased. This was mainly due to pore blocking by the heavy byproducts formed when the catalyst was exposed to a high Fig. 1.

The specific surface area of the used catalyst decreased to 100 m 2 /g. However, the catalyst showed comparable propylene conversion and PC yield when it was further reused. In summary, we have prepared a bifunctional catalyst by grafting quaternary ammonium bromide on a delaminated titanosilicate (Del-Ti-MWW). This Del-Ti-MWW-N + Bu 3 Br − was a good catalyst for the one-pot synthesis of propylene carbonate from the epoxidation and carbonation of propylene, H 2 O 2 , and CO 2 .
