Tokyo 106, Japan Received 7 September 1995; revised 11 December 1995; accepted 14 December 1995 Abstract Catalytic dehydrogenation of niethanoi has been investigated in homogeneous solutions with a series of Ru(II) complexes, [RuCl^PCp-C^^ 0e =s H W' Me (2). F (3), OMe (4)) and [RuCl^PMePh^] (5). In the gas phase, hydrogen was formed selectively ( > 99.5%), and formaldehyde, methylal (formaldehyde dimethyl acetal) and methyi formate were found in the liquid phase with satisfactory stoichiometry to the formed hydrogen. The reaction was retarded by the extra addition of free phosphine, suggesting the presence of pre-equilibrium dissociation of phosphine ligand. Kinetic analyses from this viewpoint explained well the dependence of rate on the concentration of catalyst (saturation curve). The order of evaluated pre-equilibrium constant (1 = 2 > 5) is in accord with the general idea that the dissociation of phosphine ligand is controlled principally by steric bulk of Sigands. The order of rate (3 > 1 > 2 > 4) for 1-4, possessing the same cone angle of phosphine ligand, correlated clearly with ^asicity of phosphines. The results are interpreted in terms of the mechanism of rate-determining hydrogen abstra<,noii L,. the Ru-OCH3 intermediate.

Introduction It is well known that Ru(II) complexes are particularly catalytically active for dehydrogena- tion of methanoi to give H 3 and dehydro- genated produces) (HCHO, H^CCOMe);, HCOzMe) [1-4]. The catalysts include a very common [RuC^PPh;,),] [I], and some com- plexes of other metal species are reported to be catalytically-active thermally [4] or under pho- ' Corresponding author. 1 Present address: Yokkaichi Research Laboratories, Japan Syn- thetic Rubber Co., Ltd., Kawajiri-cho 100, Yokkaichi-shi, Mie-ken 510,Japan. toirradiation [5-7]. In this reaction, formation of coordinatively unsaturated species is considered to be important. For example, [RuHUPPh,);,] and [RuHstNzXPPh,)^] are efficient catalysts, which have good leaving groups (H^ and N3, respectively) [4]. For [RuCOMeKPR^]. formation of a vacant site by bidentate to mon- odentate rearrangement of acetate ligand was suggested [3]. When Sn(II) ligand is introduced into Ru() complex, acetic acid (and/or methyl acetate) was found to be obtainable as a dehydrogenated product [11], which can formally be produced through the isomerization of methyl formate [12].

Time course for the hydrogen evolution with 1 used as catalyst ([!]= 0.045 mM). dehydrogenate methanoi to produce formalde- hyde is considered to be slowest in the overall process [9]. Thus, in order to elucidate the factors affect- ing the methanoi dehydrogenation in more de- tail, we studied here the kinetics and ligand effect using a series of Ru(II) complexes, [RuC\\^P(p-C(,HW,] (X = H (l), Me (2), F (3), OMe (4)) and [RuC^PMePh^-J (5). 2. Results and discussion Fig. 1 is a representative time course for the reaction with 1 as monitored by H 2 evolution. The evolved gas was exclusively H 3, and the amounts of other gaseous products such as CO, CO^ and CH4 were negligibly small (CO < 0.3%, COa < 0.2% and CH4 < 0.004%). Turnover numbers are calculated from the amount (mole) of Hz formed divided by the charged amount (mole) of Ru(II) complex. Ini- tial turnover rates were obtained from the initial linear slopes below a catalyst turnover number of 3.0. In the liquid phase, formaldehyde, meth- ylal (formaldehyde dimethyl acetal) and methyl formate were found, which would be formed according the following reactions [9,13]. CH.OH-^HCHO+H^ (1) HCHO + 2CH3 -> CH2(OCH3)2 + H^O (2) 2HCHO-*HCO.CH (3) Table 1 shows the amounts of hydrogen and dehydrogenated products in the liquid phase, which were formed until catalyst deactivation became noticeable. Herein the concentrations of catalysts were chosen to be as high as possible to obtain greater amounts of products. It is obvious from Table 1 that in every case there is satisfactory stoichiometry between them. 2.7. Dependence of the rate on the concentra- tion of added tertiary phosphines It was found that the reactions with [RuCl2(P(C(,H5),)J (1), [RuC\\^(P(p- C^H^Me)^^ (2) and [RuC^PMePh^] (5) were retarded by extra addition of P^H,)^, P(/?-C(;H4Me)3 and PMePh^, respectively. When the reciprocal of the initial rate (/?) was plotted as a function of the concentration of added phosphine, linear dependence was ob- served with a slight deviation in the region of low concentration (Fig. 2a, b and c). Rate retardation by the extra addition of free ligand suggests that the catalytically active Table 1 Amounts of hydrogen and liquid-phase products formed in the dehydrogenation of niethanoi with catalysts 1-5 Catalyst Concentration Reaction time H, Liquid-phase product/mmol (1+11+2X111) /mM /h /mmol HCHO (I) CH:,(OCH3);, (II) HCO.;CH3(III) /mmol 1 0.80 30 1.39 0.54 0.92 trace 1.46 2 0.65 99 1.42 0.48 0.40 0.22 1.32 3 0.35 72 0.72 trace 0.05 0.35 0.75 4 0.43 165 1.50 0.00 0.86 0.40 1.66 5 0.80 23: 2.60 0.00 0.77 0.91 2.59 L.-C.

[RuCl^PR^),] i [RuCl2(PR3)2] + PR3 (4) If the rate of dehydrogenation is expressed as a second-order rate equation with respect to the [RuC^PR^] formed and methanoi, Eq. (5) is deduced. R = k^RuCl^PR^] [MeOH] ^A-[Ru]o[MeOH] (5) where [Ru]o is the concentration of the catalyst as charged ([RuCS^PR-,)-,]-(-[RuCl^PR^]). Since the reactant methanoi is present in excess (also acting as a solvent), a pseudo zero-order approximation would result for [MeOH] (kj.MeOH]=k). Hence Eq. (5) can be rear- ranged to give Eq. (6). 1=- [^3] R ^[Ru]o ^[Ru]o (6) This equation accounts for the observed lin- ear relationships between 1/7? and [PRJ^ded in the high-concentration region. The upward devi- ations in the low-concentration region would be due to the inherent contribution of the ligand dissociation to the total concentration of free ligand, which should become appreciable in this region. The values of k and K obtained by coupled use of intercepts and slopes in Fig. 2 are summarized in Table 2. 2.2. Dependence on the catalyst concentration With 1, 2 and 5 were used as catalyst, the catalyst concentration was varied between 0.045-0.80 mM (1), 0.022-0.285 mM (2) and 0.045-0.169 mM (5), respectively. The ob- served initial rate plotted as a function of the COPC\"! ';on of catalyst is given as circles in Fig. 3a, b and c. The observed tendency of saturation in the high concentration region seems to be in accord with the presence of equilibrium in Eq. (4), because the degree of dissociation ' 'ould be lowered in this region. The postulation above was verified quantita- tively as follows.

[RuCl^PR,),] = -(^^^[Rujo - K L ' (7) (8) R=^K2+4K[Ru],-K) By use of Eq. (8) together with the values of k and K in Table 2, R can be calculated as a function of [RuJo. In Fig. 3, the relationships based on this theoretical analysis are also given as solid lines. Coincidence of experimental and theoretical values is evident, which supports the above postulation. A similar saturation curve was already pointed out for a different type of reaction with alcohols catalyzed by [RuCl^PPh^)-,], but was not analyzed quantita- tively [14]. 2.3. Mechanistic considerations It has been recognized that an equilibrium for the dissociation of phosphine ligand from [M(PR-,)] complex strongly depends on steric bulk of PR 3 [15]. Taking into considera- tion this general trend, it seems reasonable that the values of K for 1 and 2 are close to each other (Table 2), because cone angle is common (0=145 for P(p-C(,H^)^ and P(p- C^i^Me);,. The smaller cone angle of PMePh^ (0=136 would thus give a smaller value of K for 5. Since 1-4 contain the phosphine ligand with the same cone angle (145, the difference in the overall dehydrogenation rate may be caused by the process after the pre-equilibrium of Eq. (4). One of the plausible mechanisms for methanoi dehydrogenation consists of three kinds of suc- cessive processes [16-19]: (1) coordination of methanoi to the metal complex resulting in the formation of M-OCH, intermediate, (2) forma- tion of a hydride complex from the M-OCH^ intermediate via JS-hydrogen abstraction, which liberates formaldehyde, and (3) lecomposition of the hydride complex with H 2 evolution, which regenerates the catalyst. Among the three, the second process seems to be rate-determin- ing, because a lot of methoxy complexes are known [20] and stoichiometric formation of H 2 by the reaction of hydride complex with pro- tonic compound is common [21]. This view is supported by the deuterium isotope effect on the catalytic dehydrogenation of 2-propanol-2-</i with [RuCKSnC^s]4- [22], where the R^/R^ value of 2.10 is claimed to be consistent with the rate-determining hydrogen abstraction. Fig. 4 shows the plots of the common loga- rithm of initial rate (logJ?) for 1-4 vs. pK^ L.-C. Yang et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 108 (1996) 87-93 91 Fig. 4. Initial rate plotted as a function oK^ of.p-C^H^X)^ for [RuCl:,(P(p-C(,H4X)3)3] catalysts. value of conjugated acid of phosphine ligand, HPR^. Initial rates were determined here in the region of low catalyst concentration (0.045 mM), in which all the rates are approximately first- order with respect to the catalyst concentrations. It is obvious in Fig. 4 that the correlation is almost linear and the order of catalytic activity (3 (F) > l (H) > 2 (Me) > 4 (OMe)) is exactly the reverse of that for p K^ (OMe > Me > H > F), which is a good measure for the strength of (7-basicity of phosphine [23]. It is of interest that a similar plot against the Hammett o- value also gave a linear relationship (Fig. 5) [14,24]. The results in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the difference in the rate among 1-4 originates from the electronic effect of phosphine ligand, and that the rate-determining step could be ana- lyzed in terms of the basicity (electron-donating Fig. 5. Effect of substituent X in [RuCl2(P(p-C6H4X)3),i cata- lyst on the initial rate. ability) of phospl <ne ligand. Thus, the least basic Pip-C^H^.^ reduces most the electron density on Ru, which will facilitate the (electro- philic) interaction of Ru with ^-hydrogen. The strength of this interaction is expected to de- crease in the order of F (3) > H (1) > Me (2) > OMe (4). It is to be noted that the same order is also expected from the viewpoint of orbital interactions, since electron-withdrawing ligands are suggested to enhance the interaction be- tween the vacant metal d orbital and the C-H a- bond [25]. It may be possible to propose an alternative mechanism including a rate-determining oxida- tive addition of methanoi [20]. However, this process would become more advantageous for the metal center with higher electron density [26-28]. For example, the second-order rate constant for oxidailve addition of H 2 to trans- [IrCKCOXH p-C^H^XW (X = H, Me, OMe) was reported to increase in the order of H < Me < OMe [29], which is apparently opposite to the order observed here. In conclusion, the rate of methanoi dehydrogenation would be acceler- ated by introducing (1) bulky ligand(s) to en- hance the ligand dissociation, and (2) less elec- tron-donating ligand(s) to promote the hydro- gen abstraction. 3.

The reac- tion was performed at 64 (refluxing) under a nitrogen atmosphere (I aim) in a thermostated room (within 1). The reactor was equipped with a reflux condenser ( -- 20) to which a gas buret was attached. The volumetric measure- ment was started after refluxing became station- ary. Products were analyzed by GC (TCEP, Porapak T and active carbon columns). For the sake of higher precision for analyzing formalde- hyde, CO and C02 (Porapak T), a methane converter was used with a FI detector. References [1] T.A. Smith, R.P. Aplin and P.M. Maitlis, J.

Catalytic dehydrogenation of methanol has been investigated in homogeneous solutions with a series of Ru(II) complexes, [RuCl2(P(p-C6H4X)3)3] (X = H (1), Me (2), F (3), OMe (4)) and [RuCl2(PMePh2)3] (5). In the gas phase, hydrogen was formed selectively (> 99.5%), and formaldehyde, methylal (formaldehyde dimethyl acetal) and methyl formate were found in the liquid phase with satisfactory stoichiometry to the formed hydrogen. The reaction was retarded by the extra addition of free phosphine, suggesting the presence of pre-equilibrium dissociation of phosphine ligand. Kinetic analyses from this viewpoint explained well the dependence of rate on the concentration of catalyst (saturation curve). The order of evaluated pre-equilibrium constant (1 ≈ 2 > 5) is in accord with the general idea that the dissociation of phosphine ligand is controlled principally by steric bulk of ligands. The order of rate (3 > 1 > 2 > 4) for 1–4, possessing the same cone angle of phosphine ligand, correlated clearly with basicity of phosphines. The results are interpreted in terms of the mechanism of rate-determining β-hydrogen abstraction in the Ru-OCH3 intermediate.
