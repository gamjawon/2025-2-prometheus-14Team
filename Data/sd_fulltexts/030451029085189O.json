(Received September 1,1989; accepted January 19,1990) Summary Silica-bound cis - dicarbonyl- ^-chloro [ JU - [ 2- (trioxysilyl) ethanethiolato- 5':S]bis[tris(l,l-dimethylethyl)phosphine]dirhodium (1) was shown to catalyze the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and of 1,2-dihydro- naphthalenes, accompanied by ^10% dehydrogenation. The formation of tetralins and naphthalenes was found to be strongly affected by the electronic nature of the starting 1,2-dihydronaphthalene derivatives. The effect of hydroxylic solvents on the disproportionation reaction was demonstrated by application of CDaOD. A mechanism which involves both metallic centers of the dinuclear complex is proposed. Introduction The potential advantage of stable dinuclear catalysts in multi-reactant reactions has been discussed [1] and demonstrated in alkene hydrogenation and hydroformylation processes by using dirhodium complexes with either two jU-SR [2] or one /^-SR and one JU-CI ligands [3]. While the complexes with two sulfur bridges were found to be more stable than those with two different bridging groups, the latter proved by far the more versatile [4]. In addition the complexes with one thiolato and one chloro bridge could also be considerably stabilized by attachment to insoluble supports [3-6] and thus converted into most useful catalysts. In this study we report the application of silica-bound cis-dicarbonyl-jU- chloro[jU-[2-(trioxysilyl)ethanethiolato-S:S]bis[tris(l,l-dimethylethyl)phos- phine]dirhodium (1) in the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (eqn. *Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 20 (1)) and of several derivatives of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (eqn.

General procedure for disproportionation and dehydrogenation of 1,2- dihydronaphthalene derivatives Typically, a Schlenk tube was charged under argon atmosphere with 188 mg of 1 (containing 0.011 meq of Rh), 60/11 of o-xylene (internal standard) and 1 ml of dry toluene. The reaction vessel was introduced into an oil bath thermostatted at 90 0.5 C. After temperature equilibration, 71 mg (0.545 mmol) of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene were added. Samples (l-2/^l) were withdrawn periodically from the mixture and subjected to GC analysis on a 2m long column packed with 10% Carbowax 20 M on Chromosorb W at 180 C. When the reaction achieved the desired conversion, the mixture was cooled, the liquid decanted under argon, the residue washed several times with degassed toluene and dried for 1 h at room temperature at 0.05 mmHg prior to recycling of the catalyst in a subsequent run. A similar procedure was employed for disproportionation of 1,3-cyclo- hexadiene at 60 C. GC analysis of the products was performed on the same GC column below 50 C [13]. Representative results are summarized in Table 1. 21 TABLE 1 Disproportionation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,2-dihydronaphthalene derivatives'\"'1' Expt.

Results and discussion The catalyst employed in this study was a version in which the silica was impregnated with a monolayer of dicarbonyl-^-chloro[JU-[2-trioxysilyl)- ethanethiolato-S :S ] bis [tris (1,1 -dimethylethyl) phosphine] dirhodium [5]. Since full activation of the immobilized catalyst was accomplished after 2 3 runs, we pretreated it with 1,2-dihydronaphthalene at least 5 times for 2 h. After this treatment it proved to be perfectly leach-proof, and no changes in its composition with time could be detected. Both 1,3-cyclohexadiene and the various 1,2-dihydronaphthalene deri- vatives listed in Table 1 were found to undergo mainly, but not exclusively, catalytic disproportionation. A typical set of composition time profiles for the reaction of 2, R = CHa, R' = R\" = H, is given in Fig. 1. The formation of excess time , mm Fig. 1. Concentration-time profiles for the reactant and products in disproportionation of l,2-dihydro-6-methylnaphthalene by 1 under the conditions given in the Experimental section: , 2, R = CH3, R' = R\" = H; 0, 3, R = CH^ R' = R\" = H; , 4, R = CHg, R' = R\" = H. 22 fully aromatized products in all experiments indicates that up to 10% of the starting materials undergo dehydrogenation as a side reaction. A combination of disproportionation and dehydrogenation processes was recently found to occur also in the presence of the RhCla-Aliquat 336 catalyst [13]. However, while in the biphasic catalysis the ratio of disproportionation: hydrogenation could be changed by alteration of the organic solvent [13], in the present system this ratio proved to be in- dependent of the solvent, It was found also that in contrast to the RhCla-Aliquat 336-catalyzed reactions, the medium has only a marginal effect on the rate. E.g., the initial rates of transformation of 2, R = R' = R\" = H, by 1 in toluene and in s-butanol were, under the conditions given in the Experimental section at 90 C, 9.74 x 10~5 and 9.40 x 10~6 M s~1, resp- ectively. At 60 C the corresponding initial rates in toluene and methanol were 2.62 x 10-5 and 3.27 x 10-6 M s-\\ Upon substitution of the methanol by methanol-d4, only a secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed (rateo/rateH = 1.37). In spite of these results, product analysis by GC-MS revealed that the protic solvent does take part in the disproportionation process. It was found that the tetralin formed from 2, R=R'=R\"=H, and CDaOD at 60 C consisted, after a reaction time of 40 min, of 50% of unlabelled, 26% of monodeuterated and 24% of dideuterated compounds. The naphthalene formed in this experiment, as well as the recovered 1,2-dihydronaphthalene, were deuterium-free. The rate dependence on the concentration of the substrate is shown in Fig. 2. In analogy to 1-catalyzed hydrogenation of cyclohexene [5], a linear correlation between the rate and the concentration of the substrate was noticed only in dilute solution (up to ^OA M). At 0.5 M the increase in rate levelled off, and finally, when the coordination sites of the dirhodium complex were saturated by the substrate, the rate dependence became negative. Variations in the electronic nature of the substrate were found to cause significant changes in the initial rate. The figures shown in Table 1 indicate that an increase in the electron-releasing power leads to enhancement in o S 08 - 0 04 08 12 16 [ substrate] , M Fig. 2. Dependence of the initial rate of disproportionation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (2, R = R' = R\" = H) (formation of tetralin) by 1 under the conditions given in the Experimental section. 23 rate. In fact, the data for 2, R = R\" = H, R' = OCHs, 2, R = R' = R\" = H and 2, R = CHa, R' = R\" = H, can be expressed as a Hammett plot when the a\"1\" values of -0.78 and -0.10 for p-OCHs and m-CHy, respectively, [14] are used. The value of -8.5 suggests significant electron density stabilization at the site of reaction in the activated complex. Whether the data for 2, R = R\" = CHs, R' = H match with the Hammett plot cannot be estimated, since no a+ value for this combination of dimethyl groups is available. The initial rate of disproportionation of 2, R = Br, R' = R\" = H, is higher than expected and may suggest that the mechanism for the bromo compound diners from that of 1,2-dihydronaphthalenes wth electron-releasing groups (vide infra). The initial rate was found to parallel the amount of 1 only for a very narrow limit of 0.01-0.03 meq Rh. Beyond this limit, the correlation deviates strongly from linearity. The catalytic disproportionation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene by 1 was shown to be equally selective at various temperatures between 60 and 110 C. Initial rates were measured at 60, 70, 80, 90 and 110 C for several substrate concentrations between 0.50 and 0.55 M. From the results that could be expressed in terms of Arrhenius plots of -ln[rate] against l/T x 10~3 (e.g. Fig. 3), the thermodynamic constants of reaction (2) (for the case where R=R'=R\"=H) could be deduced. The observed values of = 10.47 kcal mor1 and Aff* (85 C) = 9.78 kcal mol\"1, which are lower than those of typical chemically-controlled, but higher than those of purely diffusion-controlled reactions [15], suggest that both processes contribute significantly to the progress of the catalysis. While the disproportionation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (eqn. (1)) by the RhClg-Aliquat 336 catalyst was found to proceed faster than the reaction of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (eqn. (2)), a reverse order was observed in the 1-catalyzed process. We explain this difference in terms of the different modes of activation of the substrates in reactions (1) and (2) by the dirhodium catalyst. While the transformation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene may occur at any of the two metallic centers of 1 (by a mechanism analogous to 25 26 27 28 29 30 l/TxICT3 K Fig. 3. Arrhenius plot of disproportionation of 2, R = R' = R\" =- H by 1 at 60-110 C. 24 Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism for disproportionation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene by 1. The unchanged CO, P[(CH3)gC]3 and CHgCHaSiOs-silica groups have been omitted for the sake of clarity. that described previously [13,16]), the disproportionation of the more bulky compounds 2 is believed to require both metal centers. A possible mechanism for reaction (2) which is compatible with our results is shown in Scheme 1. (The order of some steps may of course be changed). We suggest that each of the metallic centers in 1 adds one molecule of substrate to give a. Gradual abstraction of two hydrogen atoms (as hydrides) from one dihydronaphthalene ligand then forms b and c. Hydride transfer from one Rh to the adjacent metal atom may give intermediate d. Due to the significant electronic effect of the substrate, and in spite of the existence of a secondary deuterium isotope effect (which may be associated with an unsymmetrical transition state and the zero energy differences between the bond breaking and bond formation in the Rh H C and Rh D C grouping [17]), we assume that the trans- formation d >e is rate controlling. The significant negative value suggests that in this step the coordinated 1,2-dihydronaphthalene acts as a nucleophile and the rhodium center as an electrophile. This would imply that in intermediate e the benzylic carbon forms the bond with the metal. It is plausible that in the disproportionation of 2, R = Br, R' = R\" = H, the 25 electron-attracting bromine reduces the electron density on the benzylic carbon atom, and consequently the rhodium becomes, in part, attached to the homobenzylic position. Since the application of methanol-d4 as solvent leads to the formation of deuterated tetralin, but does not cause labelling of either the naphthalene or the recovered starting material, it can be concluded that step b c is not reversible. The H-D exchange is likely to take place either in c or d.
