Long-term reliance on fossil fuels is causing the energy crisis and environmental problems to worsen. As a result, it is anticipated that innovative energy-conversion technologies with great energy densities and environmental friendliness will offer trustworthy substitutes for conventional fossil-based energy systems. Nevertheless, since expensive precious metals must always be used as electrode catalysts for such devices, their widespread usage is severely hampered. Due to the increase in atomic distance and downshift in the d -band center of metal atoms caused by the entry of nitrogen atoms into the metal lattice, SMNs display surface and adsorption properties that are comparable to noble metals. In the next generation of energy storage and energy-conversion devices, SMNs have emerged as one of the best electrode materials to take the role of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. The most recent advancements in the use of SMNs for electrocatalysis are discussed in this paper. Firstly, the discussion of the origins of SMNs’ structure and activity before introducing the typical synthesis techniques used to create SMNs. Following that, it is necessary to provide examples of how mono- and multi-metallic SMNs are used in oxygen reduction, evolution, and bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Finally, the summarization of the difficulties SMNs are currently facing and projecting their future growth. Moreover, it is worth noting that the novelty of this paper is the updated reference would be carried out in this work to add scientific value and enhance the quality of the theoretical study as well as approach the cutting-edge trend all over the world.

Because of their great synergy capacity, surrounding friendliness and high level of protection, energy preservation and high conversion technologies like gas cells and metal-air batteries are developing as the following generation [2]. The selection of electrocatalytic material is crucial for practical usage because the optimistic results of such tools are substantially governed by the catalysis electrode [3]. However, their electrochemical reaction's slow kinetics could be found. This is particularly true of the many-electron transfer steps required by oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) application and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result, which both require valuable metals to assure operating efficiency and reduce overpotential. These valuable metallic include platinum/ iridium-based agent catalysts material, which is expensive and difficult to find, severely impeding their widespread commercialization [4]. Given this, several attempts have been made to investigate earth-abundant element-based electrocatalysts to eliminate the dependency on valuable metallics [5]. Covalent chemical substances, electronic crystal compounds and TM properties are characteristics of SMNs, which are created when electro-negative N ions are inserted into the internal activation places of the original types [6]. Since the molecular gap between metallic atoms grows and the d -band central changes following the addition of N molecules, SMNs display a uniform kind of surface zone and adsorption process capabilities to the 8th valuable metallics (like platinum and Palladium) as a type of non-noble metallic agent [7]. SMNs have a good deal of attempts at great-efficiency catalysts in a variety of applications, including the electrocatalysis process, hydrogenation/desulfurization reaction of gas oil, synthetic progress/decomposition reaction of NH3 and other areas [8,9]. Additionally, SMNs would be employed for extended periods in various pH settings because of their remarkable chemistry inertness properties and great corrosion resistance. Broadening the scope of their electrocatalytic use in several mediums [10,11]. Recent studies have revealed that shrinking agents to the nano range typically results in the development of remarkable physical, electronic and optimistic features [12–26]. Thus, it has a lot of interest in the investigation of nanoscale electrocatalyst materials. It is common knowledge that the greatest electrode-based agents should have exceptional ionic and electronic conductivity capacities. By reducing the ions’ diffusion length during the electrocatalytic procedure, the nanocrystalline-based electrocatalyst developed by SMNs might not only significantly decrease the wasting of valuable metallics but also enhance the good conductivity of electronics in materials. Consequently, the result of electrocatalysis could be greatly enhanced by designing suitable nanosized structures for electrode-based agents [27]. A greater particular surface zone, more adsorption process and activation places would result from the novel nano size's contribution to the electrocatalysis surface zone, which could greatly increase the electrocatalyst‘s activity [28]. Therefore, a key area of study for electrode-based materials catalysts reaction of energy durable and conversion tools is the rational craft of SMN-based materials (Fig. 1 ). In this review, the mission is to seek to compile and discuss the most popular preparation techniques and structural features of SMNs, which exhibit exceptional performance and show promise for usage in the upcoming power durable and conversion technologies. Additionally, the potential uses of SMNs in electrochemical processes including ORR results, OER performance and BOR performance in which a catalyst exhibits electrocatalytic properties for both ORR results and OER outcome – are covered in detail. The main potential and difficulties for future research orientations on SMN-based materials are suggested at the conclusion of this paper. 2 Various synthetic pathways and structural features of SMNs It would no hesitation that SMNs have attracted the attraction and concern of many academics and organizations because of their exceptional electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, there are currently just a few research and conversations on preparatory tactics, which slows down the enhancement of SMNs. Mechanical and chemical approaches make up the bulk of the synthetic process of SMNs (Fig. 2 ). While the chemical procedures typically engage the immediate nitridation stage of TM, TMO, the ammonolyses process of TMC, the solvothermal process, the heat decomposition process of polymer initial agents, and so forth, the physical paths primarily engage laser cutting, sputtering, PVD, etc. 2.1 Physical pathway Deposition, in which the model is primarily formed as an ultra-sheet, is the greatest popular synthetic process in the mechanical method. In another state, the reactants are loaded onto the analyte via various physical methods. Currently, the PVD technique is a common deposition technique. PVDs indicate the employment of physical procedures (such as material thermal evaporation) to induce the source material's surface vaporization under a vacuum. To attain the hold of molecule transport from origin agents to doping, molecules, or radically electronic ions are then accumulated to create an ultrathin sheet with several particular functional parts on the surface zone of the analyte using low pressure. To create SMNs, the PVD technique is consistently integrated with some else mechanical techniques (like the sputtering method, ion irradiation method, and etc.,.). Because of its quick deposition rate, the sputtering method is the greatest employed physical method technique. It uses nitrogen plays the role of the reaction process agent gas in PVD to create great-purity ultrathin sheet models with adjustable stoichiometry measures and composition agents. For example, Zhu and his team successfully used tailored analyte radio density magnetron thing sputtering and employ PVD technology to produce cubic, wurtzite and unstable HPP of BRN sheets on the metallic compound alloy analytes [29]. FT-IR tests indicated that the cubic BRN phase made up around half of the film. The obtained cubic BRN phase has reduced internal stress compared to the CP created by the conventional LEI bombardment, which might largely resolve weak substrate adhesion and delamination. The active sputtering method in the presence of N2 currently produced nickel nitride ultra-sheet films with the shape of a cauliflower form and TCL [30]. Moreover, magnetron co-sputtering assisted molybdovanadate nitride ultra-sheet films on bi-metal C paper were described [31], and a variety of Mo3N2, Ag-Mo3N2, V-Mo3N2 and CuMo3N2 films were created using this method [32]. Sputtering is not the only method utilized in conjunction with PVD to create thin SMN films; another technique famous for IMVD also uses ion irradiation. As an illustration, TiAlN films were created by simultaneously depositing both titanium and aluminum metallic gas and ionizing nitrogen [33]. Using many electronic molecule plating and this PVD technique, Liu and the team created a new compound of titanium-aluminum-zirconium nitride doping on Si3N4 ceramic substrates [34]. The Si3N4 cutting devices manufactured at 2.5 Pa gas pressure exhibited the greatest physical results and the longest lifetime titanium-aluminum-zirconium nitride dopings. 2.2 Chemical pathway The chemical production of SMNs typically uses 2 stages and heat-programmed reactions. Firstly, various techniques are employed to synthesize the SMNs’ precursors. Moreover, to produce a variety of SMNs, the metal precursors are nitridated in an environment of NH3 or N2/H2 at various temperatures [35]. The chemistry synthesis for SMNs could be classified into the TMO technique, TMC technique, MOF and other ways built by the various kinds of precursors. 2.2.1 TMO-based path The prevalent substance shape of TM, TMO, is frequently utilized as a precursor before nitridation in order to prepare SMN [36]. To produce SMNs with various diameters, heated NH3 temperature-treated at medium heat at 300 – 800 °C was currently improved. Except for those exterior mesopores caused by the density shrink when the N molecule in the network-typed lattice replaced the O2 atom, the morphology acquired by SMNs is mostly inherited from TMO. Big mass transfer is prompted by SMNs’ high porosity into their downside usage. To manufacture an outside porosity 2 layers molybdenum-Ox (MoOx/TiN/MoOx) nanotube with good conductivity, Peng and his colleagues converted a TiO2 nanosized tube array into titanium nitride and employed the obtained mesoporous titanium nitride nanosized tube as central cores [37]. The porous design max peaks the risk of reactive areas and makes electrolyte penetration easier. The TiN compound also has a large particular density because of its strong conductivity. MoO3 was changed to Mo2N using a heat-programmed reaction in an NH3 and N2/H2 environment [38]. An outstanding electrocatalytic result in hydro denitrification, hydrodesulfurization result, hydrolysis process and hydrogenation performance are demonstrated by the synthetic progress of an electrocatalyst, which has an uneven surface with a lot of nanopores and a large particular surface area. In one separate paper, Yang and his team described how they produced vanadium nitride, titanium nitride, niobium nitride and tantalum nitride by sending ammonia via a pipeline device including the metal oxides of vanadium, titanium and niobium and tantalum while being shielded from the air by Ar gas [39]. Such preparation procedures, though, are frequently time-wasting. A unique quick nitriding method was summarized [40] in order to speed up the synthesized procedure and decrease reaction period time. Mesoporous TMO was used to create several mesoporous SMNs. The organized microporosity encourages the interaction of NH3 and initial agents, which significantly shortens the nitridation time. Furthermore, such quick nitriding prevents mesoporous structures from closing and collapsing within the nitridation procedure. The scientists also discovered that amorphous TMO might be employed to create SMNs. For instance, it was suggested [41] to progress metastable MoO2 via N2H4 reduction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 aqueous solution. At NH3 flow temperatures below 400.12 °C, the amorphous MoO2 was changed into FCC-MoO2 and at a higher heat of 600.2 °C, into hexagonal-Mo2N. The technique for creating SMNs using TMO as initial agents is quite well-developed and popular. Nevertheless, this method always includes high heat treatment, where TMO frequently suffers crystal change or transition among crystal and mesoporous structures. This led to insufficient nitridation of the TM and might influence the lasting structure of SMNs. 2.2.2 MOF path Additionally, MOF are frequently employed as SMNs production precursors. Crystalline porous MOF agents with periodic net topologies created by TM self-assembly organic ligands with electronics or metallic groups via coordination connections or other factors. Because of MOF's distinctive porous structure, SMNs made from them often exhibit a high level of porosity [42,43]. The wealth porous structure could boost the active sites’ exposure and swift mass transport in application to electrocatalysis use. SMNs produced from MOF have been improved in various papers in current years. For instance, by simply nitriding ZIF-67@Fe, porous Co3FeNx/N-doped CNTs arrays assisted on C fabric were created [44]. SEP was endowed by the hierarchically porous architectures in the produced samples. Additionally, by HWPcracking Mn C2H3N3 in an O2-free atmosphere, a unique technique for producing MnN was disclosed [45]. By pyrolyzing the Mn-including SIF molecular, Co@Co4N/MnONC was created [46]. Several porous FeN NPs were created utilizing PB as a cubic MOF-like crystal, an early stage using a quick nitridation procedure [47]. The samples made of FeN mostly kept the after-transformation, nanoscale structure with a high particular surface zone. 2.2.3 TMC path It is commonly utilized for synthesizing SMNs since the reaction heat of TMC and NH3 is not greater than TMO. For instance, a 2-stage procedure was recorded for the manufacture of TaN, Ta2N and WN [48]. TaCl and WCl were first ammonolyses at ambient heat in an anhydrous CCl4 solution. The obtained powder-shape product was then heated at 605 °Celsius in an NH3 environment to produce TaN, Ta2N and WN. Moreover, AEC (alkaline-earth chloride) NPs were acquired by chlorinating scheelite with chloroform. The molybdenum- and vonfram nitride were then produced by ammonolysis using these NPs [49]. By doing so, it was possible to nitride transition metals at 490 – 560 °C, which is significantly smaller than the heat required for the conventional ammoniation of TMO employing ammonia or nitrogen/hydrogen mixed with the purity concentration. Additionally, the TMC approach might be effective for producing NCPs made of transition metals and nitride. For instance, a unique method was created to create mesoporous Pd/ceramic NCPs NMTs from the ceramic compound with SDG and PdCl2 [50]. This all-purpose technique might also be utilized to create various M/ceramic NCPs with high particular surface zones (such as M could be Nickel, cobalt, zirconium, or rubidium). This work helped to clarify the viability of metal-urea chloride-based, low-heat production by demonstrating how different metal nitrides (like Chromium, iron-N, etc.) may be produced utilizing metallic-NH2 chloride as initial agents [51]. Furthermore, the nucleation development mechanism served as the foundation for the change reaction. It was also thought of using metal-based complexes as starting materials to create SMNs powders-shape and coatings, for instance, was described by Weil's team in their technique [52]. TMCs were initially diluted in organic solvents like CH3CN, and the acquiring mixture was then added with AA to produce a viscous agent chelating aqueous solution, which served as the input materials for producing SMNs via the temperature treatment path. Even though the TMC approach produces SMNs at a smaller heat than the TMO technique, it is impractical to produce them on a wide scale because of the time-consuming reaction stages and plentiful natural organic agents. 2.2.4 By other chemical agent's paths Numerous other chemical synthesis techniques, in addition to those already described, have been used by scientists to create SMNs. For instance, TM was diluted into the Zn aqueous solution by the Barker team. After that, the binary nitrides and four-metallic nitrides were created by reacting the aqueous solution with N [53]. By using a salt-templating technique, it was possible to create nanosheets of 2D manganese nitride, which was produced on the surface zone of the salt compound with the assistance of a lattice matching process [54]. Additionally, urea was used as an N origin to successfully synthesize a variety of SMNs materials including Titanium, Niobium, molybdenum, tungsten nitrides and Niobium-carbonx-nitride1-x binary compound, with great yields [55]. In summary, researchers have created a variety of SMNs with a wide range of morphologies utilizing a variety of starting materials and nitriding techniques. There are still a lot of workable solutions that should be considered in the long term. Nevertheless, some modifications in electronic structure sometimes could not improve the desiring results [56]. Thus, this would be the specific point of the review work and the valuable-scientific for the future SMN research. 3 Application of SMNs to electrocatalysts Serving as electrocatalysts applications, SMNs are employed because of their great stable structure, good electrical conductivity and potent anti-toxic properties [57]. The features of covalent substances, ionic crystals compounds and TMs are all present in SMNs, a type of interstitial nanocrystalline agents that are created by the reorganization of MMB, the creation of non- and metal atoms and the electrons transport between non- and metal atoms. In contrast, the greatly electro-negative N molecule in the gap widens the distance between the metal atoms, causing the TM d -band to contract and the state's density at the Fermi order to rise. As a result, the SMNs (such as titanium, nickel, iron, cobalt, molybdenum, etc.) have surface features and adsorption traits that are comparable to noble metal atoms [58]. Therefore, SMNs express well in the fields of ORR performance, OER result, BOR, and other related processes. 3.1 ORR applications The platinum-based electrocatalyst is currently the key component of the ORE procedure. Nevertheless, the reliance of energy durable tools for valuable metal atoms has significantly hindered its industrialization progress due to the scarcity of platinum supplies and the ongoing price growth. Because of their relatively low cost, plentiful reserves and equivalent electrocatalytic activity, SMNs are regarded as one of the greatest prospective replacements for noble metallic atoms for ORR electrocatalysts application [59] (Fig. 3 ). 3.1.1 Metal-only SMNs Serving as ORR electrocatalysts application, SMNs molecules were initially identified in 1964 [60]. In his work, Jasinski discovered that Co, working with N, had a promising ORR reaction. Since that time, SMNs have received a lot of research. In a work by Zheng and his team on SMNs used as assistance for good dispersed valuable metal atoms, a three dimension layered porosity platinum/titanium nitrides electrocatalyst was created using a straightforward method [61]. The good conductivity properties and industry synthetic compound stability of platinum atoms were significantly enhanced by the porosity 3-dimension assistance with greater mechanical durability and resistance to corrosion. Platinum/titanium nitrides demonstrated better electrochemical results than platinum/carbon as an obtained product, including a 40.5 mV negative change in the HWP (E1/2 ) and greater stability. Similar to this, a straightforward technique was suggested to produce highly porous chromium nitride by the ammonolyses process of a material potassium dichromate and a platinum/chromium nitride electrocatalyst material was acquired with highly porous CrN as the helping agent, overcoming the corrosion difficulties for C assistance [62]. In comparison to platinum/carbon, the platinum/chromium nitride electrocatalyst demonstrated greater corrosion resistance results and EASA. The good conductivity properties of the chromium nitride assistance and the energetic interaction between the platinum and chromium nitride assistance are both credited with the improved EC. The Yue team conducted a comparison between the EC and stability of platinum/ titanium nitride and platinum/carbon in another record. According to this study, the platinum/titanium nitride compound electrocatalyst showed a 22.04% drop in the first EASA after over one thousand cycles, which was noticeably better than the platinum/carbon compound electrocatalyst's (66.12%) value [63]. Additionally, the platinum/ titanium nitride's E1/2 (0.852 V) was greater than platinum/ carbon (0.841 V) at a uniform time. These optimistic results were explained by the same energy orders of the platinum-d and nitrogen-p states, which made it easier for electrons to transport and produce platinum-nitrogen-titanium bonds. SMNs have recently been utilized to apply for ORR electrocatalysis agents as well. Agents as electrocatalysts made of molybdenum (I, II) nitride/carbon were created and the connection between their structures and ORR results was investigated [64]. This research showed that there was an extremely narrow energetic difference among the HOMO results of molybdenum (I) nitride/ carbon and the oxygen's LUMO, which obtained in a rapid connection them electron transport. In oxygen-saturated perchloric acid, molybdenum (I) nitride/ carbon demonstrated more ORR EC than molybdenum (II) nitride/carbon. Several unique heterostructure nickel nitride QDs were described, and additionally, the molybdenum nitride-based electrocatalyst, which was evenly spaced out throughout the nickel (II) oxide ultrathin surface [65]. Built by the ESC, nickel nitride QDs demonstrated a potent interaction with nickel (II) oxide ultrathin shape that created a special ES around the order of Fermi. This interaction could be briefly summarized the conversion of O2 in *OO. It demands a 0.412 eV energy for the barrier. Thus, the rate-limiting step would be indicated for the forming *OO for the ORR procedure [66,67]. This architecture not only improved carrier concentration power and level of conductivity properties but also expanded the active O2 sites. The change of carrier concentration would be considered the build of the novel power level through the Fermi level order with a significantly small band gap, compared to origin NiO [68]. The advantageous nickel nitride QDs/ nickel (II) oxide agent electrocatalysts’ ORR performance activity, therefore, matched that of platinum/ carbon. 3.1.2 Metal-multiplied SMNs Even though the metal-only SMNs exhibit excellent EC, numerous researchers have experimented with metal-multiplied SMNs to increase the ORR reaction. The drawbacks of initial SMNs (such as scandium, titanium, chromium and vanadium-nitride) as effective agent electrocatalysts were investigated by the Luo team [69]. To increase the ORR performance, this study produced V0.952M0.048N (in which M could be copper, nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese, chromium and titanium) and presented a method of combining with TMs. With QFE transport, V0.948Co0.049N outperformed the others for ORR results and the findings were on par with almost 19.97% (w/w) platinum/ carbon for an alkaline condition. The impacts of the combination elements (such as iron, cobalt and nickel) on titanium nitride as an electrocatalyst were studied by Tian and his colleague [70]. The test performances illustrated that the combination may affect the nanostructure of titanium nitride by reducing the d -band gap of titanium ions, which enhances the capability to supply O2 with electrons. Most significantly, titanium0.952nickel0.049nitrogen's ORR results in 100 mM potassium hydroxide solution were nearly on par with that of industrial platinum/ carbon. Lately, it was suggested [71] to conduct ongoing research on the influences of Co combining with titanium nitride's EC. The solvothermal process with the post-N method was utilized to manufacture titanium0.79cobalt0.21nitrogen ultrathin demonstrated the electric change impact brought on by cobalt combining with hollow microstructure, giving the titanium0.79cobalt0.21nitrogen agent electrocatalyst an outstanding E1/2 of 0.852 V. During 5100 cycles of durability testing with just need a 4.2 mV movement in the E1/2, the performance electrocatalyst demonstrated strong stability. Tian and colleagues generated SMNs with cobalt combined with titanium nitride play the role of an OR reaction agent electrocatalysts, whereas the Li team used a hydrothermal technique and post-N process to create titanium0.954iron0.049nitrogen assistance with a significant specific surface zone and good conductivity [72]. Thus, compared to platinum/carbon, platinum/ titanium0.948iron0.051nitrogen showed greater results and durability features. On the recent state, it was clear that the EASA of platinum/ carbon and platinum/ titanium0.952iron0.048nitrogen fell by 29.04% and 7.12%, respectively during 1100 cycles and by 89.98% and 29.97%, respectively during 4998 cycles. Additionally, adding iron to titanium nitride microtubes improved the synergetic impact between metallic molecules, which led to the platinum/titanium0.952iron0.048nitrogen microtubes electrocatalyst agent having greater performance. This part clearly illustrates that SMNs hold great promise for enhancing ORR reaction electrocatalysis results, particularly within an alkaline solution. Nevertheless, there is an emergency demand for a solution to the problem of SMNs’ weak performance and stability in the acidic solution. 3.2 OER application There is no denying that NCPs based on noble metals (iridium and ruthenium) exhibit favorable performance toward the OER results. Ruthenium-based agent electrocatalysts are less stable than those built with noble metals and their lack of availability and expensive cost make their use in this sector unsustainable. Exploring new OER electrocatalysts NCPs that have a much lower power density, improved durability and cheaper price is crucial. Because their electrical nanostructure resembles that of valuable metals, SMNs have received a lot of interest lately [73]. Table 1 summarizes the specific OER results and Fig. 4 describes the three-form of SMN-based electrocatalytic materials and Fig. 5 describe a detailed OER procedure. Herein, 1D nanosized architecture materials are particularly well suited to the sector of electrocatalysis due to their distinctive surface area impacts, readily controllable size, great substrate agglutination and other special qualities [74]. Moreover, huge architectural distortions, huge surface area dangling bondings and coordinated-unsaturated surface area atoms present in the 2D materals could lead to great surface chemical activity, boost precursor chemisorption and speed up interfacial transport, all of which improve the electrocatalytic outcome [75]. 3.2.1 Metal-only SMNs The modification of the M-N binding and the concentration of the metallic d -band give the cobalt-based nitride compound serving the role of an electrocatalytic agent with great electron-losing capacity and good endurance. On the basis of carbon fabric, cobalt (I) nitride porosity microwires were created, and the electrocatalysis agents showed better results for OER reaction with an applied potential at 0.011 A cm−2 of 0.255 V, which resulted from the interaction of the metallic characteristic, one-dimension porosity microwires arrays and distinctive 3-dimension electrode arrangement [79]. This is several merits of one-dimensional materials to electrocatalysis sector. Lately, a fresh approach was suggested to synthesizing CoN via the usage of nitrogen RFP was created [78]. This method just required one minute to acquire CoN. In the OER progress field, Ni- and Fe-based SMNs electrocatalyst agents were used, in addition, to Co-based ones. For ultrathin material nickel nitride, Xu and colleagues created the OER agent electrocatalysts [81]. The ultrathin of nickel nitride described a good result in the OER reaction with the Tafel slope value of 0.045 V dec−1 and an applied potential of 0.35 V for a lot of catalytic activity and good conductivity. The OER reaction could be increased through a known method called SPRN. In order to create iron (I) nitride NPs with porous and good electronic conductivity that may be employed as a plasmonic agent to produce hot electronics, the Zeng team improved an ionic exchange technique [86]. With a very low applied voltage of 0.27 V and a current value of 0.01 A cm−2, the iron (I) nitride NPs acted as effective OER agents as electrocatalysts exist with an alkaline solution. The strong SMNs also exhibit excellent promise as assistance for NPs made of noble-type metallics. Titanium nitride was efficiently used as assistance by the Li team loaded NPs of iridium (IV) oxide combined with iridium. Ir's electrical characteristics are further altered by SMNs assistance, which downshifts the d-band central and encourages OER performance and durability. This also defines the benefits of three-dimensional materials to electrocatalytic process. 3.2.2 Metal-multiplied SMNs Many scientists have revealed that adding heteroatoms to metal-only SMNs can enhance the OER results of these materials by altering their electrical properties, enhancing the cooperation of the surrounding around the metal cations and enhancing the medium adsorption and desorption of the interaction. This contributes to the advantages of two-dimensional materials to electrocatalysis fields. By EDP, Wang and colleagues generated NiCo2N ultrathin over high porosity nickel foam [77]. Because of its 3-dimensions, interlinked porosity structure size and the energy impact of bi-metal catalytic activity, the resulting nickel-cobalt nitride combined nickel foam electrocatalyst demonstrated strong work durability and potential performance for OER reaction with an applied voltage of 0.28 V at 0.01 A cm−2. The energy influence of Ni-Co was explored concerning an exterior nitridation approach [89]. With an applied voltage of 215 mV coupled with the Tafel slope value of 0.052 V dec−1 with alkaline conditions, the produced NiCo2N NCTs on carbon fabric displayed exceptional performance. These values were significantly smaller than industrial IrO2. An uncomplicated technology to create holey CoFe2N ultrathin built by NF analyte was provided by Li and his team [82]. The produced cobalt-iron-nitrogenx-hydrogen-nitrogen-arsenic/ nickel foam, which had a high EASA, a small charge transport resistance and quick mass diffusion, acted as an alluring OER agent serving the role of an electrocatalytic material. This material electrocatalyst also displayed a small applied voltage of 0.272 V. Additionally, the ratio effects on the Fe and Co ions on the iron-cobalt nitride composite electrocatalyst agent was examined [88]. The findings expressed that the ideal composite is cobalt-iron (3:1, m/m)-nitride had exceptional endurance and extraordinary results of OER reaction, with a specific capacity of 0.212 V. The Sun team prepared a cobalt nitride combined with cerium oxide composite hybrid ultrathin array developed on GPP coated by cobalt nitride connected with cerium oxide via anion atoms, intercalation increased the EDP technique and followed by nitridation by making application of the energetic impact of CoN linked to cerium oxide [83]. A small voltage of 0.236 V to achieve a current magnitude of 0.012 A cm−2 and everlasting stability at a high current of 0.52 A cm−2 over 48 h are proving that the treating process of cerium oxide coupled cobalt nitride porosity ultrathin considerably increased the OER results. 2D and crystal NMTs iron-nickel nitride combined with rGO NCPs layers were created for Ni-Fe bimetal SMNs electrocatalyst [84]. The obtained performance electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional results with a 0.27 V voltage and 0.013 A cm−2 and it has strong lifelong durability lasting over one day. The energetic interaction of crystal NMTs iron-nickel nitride and GNS sparked the optimistic OER result and its distinctive nano-size structure. Additionally, iron-nickel nitride–nickel sub sulfide composite serves as an electrocatalysts agent and was created in 2 stages of the hydrothermal process and then being nitridation procedures [87] and it exhibits outstanding OER results with an applied voltage of 210 mV coupled with the calculated Tafel slope value of 0.039 V dec−1. After almost 11 h, the electrocatalyst exhibited no overt signs of degradation. It was also discovered that iron-nickel nitride connected with nickel sub sulfide has an electron impact that lowers the EaOER procedure and increases the electrocatalyst's fundamental performance. Nickel-iron nitride was built on three-dimension system assistance of the SG foam would further demonstrate that the iron coating altered the electrical architecture of nickel nitride and enhanced the reduction outcome for the OER agent electrocatalyst material surface [80]. A small voltage of 0.224 V and 0.02 A cm−2 demonstrates the electrocatalyst's increased OER performance. It would be highlighted that the three-dimension architecture boosted activated domain access and improved EASA, which aided reactant agent diffusion and quickened the procedure of the OER's electrocatalysis material. A nickel-(iron) oxyhydroxides/ nickel-iron nitride/ nickel junction heterostructure would be employed to combine a uniform strategy and the significance of heterostructure in enhancing OER outcome was emphasized [85]. The produced electrocatalyst had an appealing OER result, which was considered advantageous for ion exchange. This electrocatalyst outperformed most currently recorded material electrocatalyst agents and industrial ruthenium oxide by only requiring an applied voltage of 0.21 V to activate 0.014 A cm−2. Moreover, as OER material electrocatalysts, Mo2N@Ni NCPs were also created, and they demonstrated an impressive voltage of 0.22 V as well as lifelong durability for more than 4 days [76]. It also suggested that SMNs material can create a heterojunction that improves the electrocatalysis activity when combined with several active components. 3.3 Electrocatalysis application for ORR results and OER outcomes using bi-functional SMNs The greatest ORR electrocatalytic agents up until this point have been platinum-based ones. Nevertheless, the primary selection of OER electrocatalytic agents has been iridium/ rubidium-based ones. Purity platinum or iridium/ rubidium-based NMTs, on another state, are overpriced and insufficiently energetic for bi-function OER outcome and ORR applications. Thus, SMN-based NMTs have received a lot of attention at this time [90] and perform as greatly active and durable bi-function electrocatalysis materials. Additionally, Table 2 displays the OER outcome and ORR results in characteristics of currently described bi-function electrocatalytic materials based on SMNs. Nickel-iron nitride combined with nano-reduced graphene oxide, new bi-function electrocatalytic agents that were developed [91], showed promise as a possible alternative to industrial noble-metal electrocatalytic materials. Moreover, to dispersing the nickel-iron nitride nanosized plates, the nanosized-reduced graphene oxide also offered a supportive environment for the EASA's excellent stability. With the minimum initial applied voltage of 0.14 V for OER results and the maximum initial voltage of 912 mV for ORR performance for all models, nickel-iron nitride combined with nano-reduced graphene oxide was proven to provide exceptional results in both applications of OER results and ORR by connecting the learning and practicing techniques. Additionally, a brand-new bi-function nickel-iron nitride combined with cobalt or nitrogen coated by carbon nanofibers electrocatalytic material that drives both results of ORR application and OER was received [92]. The cobalt or nitrogen connected with carbon nanofibers' electrocatalytic agents supporting caused the nickel-iron nitride NPs to be widely disseminated. The produced electrocatalytic materials showed superior ORR outcome and OER performances than the outcomes of noble-metal electrocatalytic agents due to the energetic impact of nickel-iron nitride and cobalt, nitrogen combined with carbon nanofibers by an applied voltage of 0.26 V for OER activities and E1/2 of 800 mV for ORR results. Extremely tiny iron nitride NPs produced on carbon nanotubes were also recorded by Zhang and his colleagues. The iron nitride NPs of iron nitride carbon nanotubes were significantly lower (5.1 nm) than the origin iron nitride NPs [93]. Thus, the voltage for the OER reaction was 231 mV coupled with the E1/2 of iron nitride carbon nanotube for ORR results was 700 mV. This research could lead to a brand-new, ecologically benign method for creating ultrathin SMNs. A highly porous NiFe3N electrocatalytic material was created without C assistance to increase the durability of the NiFe3N electrocatalytic agents [94]. The mesoporous microspheres that made up the nickel-iron nitride electrocatalytic agent had a large particular surface area and offered a lot of interlayer pores space. Employing this way, the model produced had outstanding ORR results with an E1/2 of 770 mV and supreme OER performance with a small voltage of 0.351 V at 0.0012 A cm−2. An atomic sheet shape of nickel-iron-manganese, a tri-metal electrocatalytic material, was created and maintained by titanium molecules on the compound of Ti3C2 ultrathin [95]. A significant force for the reaction was created by the close connection among the films, thus, preventing the build-up of a -N group film. The acquiring bi-function electrocatalytic material displayed steady phases of discharge and charge switching over five days and the smallest ΔE (followed by the equation: ΔE = Ej=10 – E1/2 ) of 670 mV. This research revealed that tri-metal nitride electrocatalytic materials’ strong electrocatalysis results and offered a fresh method for using two-dimension films in versatile and wearable technology. Contrary to the mentioned references, mesoporous NiFe3N was created as the assistance for iron-platinum electrocatalysis materials [96]. In one word, an organized iron-platinum interlayer metal alloy compound had a defined component and architecture, in contrast to the extensively researched platinum-M unstructured alloys compounds, which was advantageous for the great dispersal of catalytic activities. Nickel-iron nitride assistance, in another word, had exceptional chemical durability and good conductivity performance. Due to this, the compound of iron platinum combined with nickel-iron nitride electrocatalysis material had good electrocatalytic results for applications of OER outcome and ORR results and was able to cycle zinc-air space batteries for almost 3 weeks at 0.0012 A cm−2. C3H6N6 was used by Chen and colleagues to produce a composite of CoN combined with C3H6N6-coated nitrogen-carbon [63]. In addition, C3H6N6 controlled the nanosized and arrangement of CoN crystalline structure, in additionally, to serving as an N-doping material. It also assisted improve the conductivity result and EASA outcome of the electrocatalysis material. Thus, this composite acted as an electrocatalysis agent with great performance and lifelong stability of the air space cathode of re-charge ability zinc-air void batteries and for ORR outcome and OER applications. This experiment also offered a successful method for creating non-noble metallic electrocatalysis agents with adjustable shapes. Co4N NPs were created by the Guan team and helped on a film of N-coated rGO [97]. The electrocatalysis performance of this versatile agent was adequate for applications of OER outcome and ORR result, with a small, applied voltage of 0.37 V at the magnitude of 0.013 A cm−2 and the E1/2 value of 810 mV in the 100 mM KOH aqueous solution. 4 Conclusion, future challenges and insight In the study, we outlined the most current improvements in the creation and use of SMNs for OER outcomes and ORR reactions. It is possible to increase the similarity of the SMNs’ features to noble molecular metals by choosing various SMI (such as titanium, nickel, iron, cobalt, or molybdenum) or adding heteromolecular to the function TM. Furthermore, utilizing SMN rod-shaped NMTs and mesoporous nanostructures, which were shown to significantly improve the electrocatalysis results of SMNs, is a great-effectively multi-resolution mass transport nanostructure that was built. The following issues demand to be researched further to advance SMN creation and applicability: - The production of SMN electrocatalysis material has been constrained to lab creation since it is expensive and difficult to work on a big range. Thus, for the next experiments, it is important to look at straightforward, affordable, and ecologically friendly production techniques. - By the virtue of the dissolving of TM, the protonation process of catalytic activation, and the corrosion progress of conductive analyte, the outcome of SMN electrocatalytic material would be significantly decreased in acidic solutions or a surrounding with an extra value of pH circumstances. Therefore, it is necessary to create SMN electrocatalytic agents with strong durability and storage ability. These could be seen as significant insights for the next research studies and made the specific innovation of this review work, compared to other studies before. Moreover, it is worth noting that this work has summarised the newly references within 5 years of 2023 about the applications of SMNs materials in electrocatalysis as well as discussed several unique points from some valuable materials with the novel of applying SMNs in ORR and OER processes. Additionally, thanks to the report of several synthetic procedures to modify SMNs into a lot of types of materials for the electrocatalytic progress, the future research could take some information and develop further for using SMNs nanosized materials as electrocatalyst and even other applications. This contributes to the role of SMNs in the electrocatalysis sector. On the other hand, the systematic review in data through some tables allows the easily reference and improve these data to generate better studies. Thus, this work could give the chance to enhance more the performance of OER and ORR reactions. Furthermore, from the listed data in tables in the manuscript, the scientists could make experiments to produce better studies with the most effective detectable limit values.

        "dc:description": "Long-term reliance on fossil fuels is causing the energy crisis and environmental problems to worsen. As a result, it is anticipated that innovative energy-conversion technologies with great energy densities and environmental friendliness will offer trustworthy substitutes for conventional fossil-based energy systems. Nevertheless, since expensive precious metals must always be used as electrode catalysts for such devices, their widespread usage is severely hampered. Due to the increase in atomic distance and downshift in the d -band center of metal atoms caused by the entry of nitrogen atoms into the metal lattice, SMNs display surface and adsorption properties that are comparable to noble metals. In the next generation of energy storage and energy-conversion devices, SMNs have emerged as one of the best electrode materials to take the role of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. The most recent advancements in the use of SMNs for electrocatalysis are discussed in this paper. Firstly, the discussion of the origins of SMNs’ structure and activity before introducing the typical synthesis techniques used to create SMNs. Following that, it is necessary to provide examples of how mono- and multi-metallic SMNs are used in oxygen reduction, evolution, and bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Finally, the summarization of the difficulties SMNs are currently facing and projecting their future growth. Moreover, it is worth noting that the novelty of this paper is the updated reference would be carried out in this work to add scientific value and enhance the quality of the theoretical study as well as approach the cutting-edge trend all over the world.",
