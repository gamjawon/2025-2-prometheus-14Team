Graphical Abstract V2O5/CeF3 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method during which, the Cerium Vanadate (CeVO4) formation was observed and confirmed by pore size distribution, powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR techniques. The CeVO4 species is responsible for their high activity and selectivity for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile fx1. V2O5/CeF3 catalysts with 2.4–15.2wt.% of V2O5 were prepared by wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by BET surface area and pore size distribution, powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. It was found that the formation of Cerium Vanadate (CeVO4) occurs during the stages of the catalyst preparation. The X-ray diffraction studies of the catalysts revealed the presence of crystalline CeVO4 phase. The lines due to CeVO4 phase were found to increase in intensity with the increase in amount (wt.%) of V2O5 in the catalysts. The FT-IR investigation also showed the formation of CeVO4 phase with increasing loadings of V2O5. The shift of pore-size distribution to lower pore range and increased pore volume confirmed the formation of CeVO4 structure in the catalysts. The catalytic activity for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile on V2O5/CeF3 catalysts as a function of V2O5 loading on CeF3 has been studied. The continuous increase of CeVO4 with V2O5 loadings is responsible for the higher ammoxidation activity of the V2O5/CeF3 catalysts. Keywords V2O5/CeF3 catalysts CeVO4 Ammoxidation 3-Picoline Nicotinonitrile. 1 Introduction It is well known that the TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, SnO2 and ZrO2 are conventional supports for the V2O5 catalysts for oxidation and ammoxidation reactions such as selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [1,2], ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile [3–5], methyl benzenes to corresponding benzonitriles [6,7], methyl pyrazine to cyano pyrazines [8] and methyl pyridines to corresponding cyano pyridines [9–11]. Due to stringent environmental legislations more active and selective catalysts are being sought. Hence, deep insight in to selection of compatible catalysts and supports is one of the research goals of the topic. As on today, V2O5-based catalysts are of prime importance in the oxidation as well as ammoxidation of light paraffins, olefins and aromatics as shown recently by Grasselli in a review on advances and future trends in selective oxidation and ammoxidation catalysis [12]. Zhang et al. [13] have prepared and used CeF3 supported rare earth oxide catalysts, CeO2/CeF3, La2O3/4CeF3 and Sm2O3/4CeF3 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Zhang et al. [14] have also prepared a highly active multivalent anion modified complex catalyst, Y2O3 + CeF3 and evaluated for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. Sichkar et al. [15] have found that CeF3 is a better support for Pd in hydrogenation of 1-heptene than NaF, CaF2, MgF2, BaF2 and AlF3, etc. CeF3 was also used as a support for preparing highly dispersed Au catalysts with Au particle size <10nm for oxidation reactions [16]. As it is evident from the literature that the fluoride supported V2O5 catalysts are active and selective for the ammoxidation reactions [17–20], CeF3 has judicially been selected as the support for the V2O5 catalysts for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline. Results of our recent study [9] on the CeO2 as a catalyst for ammoxidation of picolines and the documented literature [13–20] have prompted us to explore whether CeF3 can be used as a novel support for vanadia catalysts and further investigate their physico-chemical characteristics and ammoxidation activity for 3-picoline. In the present study, we communicate the preparation of cerium fluoride supported V2O5 catalysts and their physico-chemical characterization in support of CeVO4 formation. The catalytic performance of these catalysts for the vapor phase ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile has also been described as a preliminary investigation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation CeF3 supported vanadia catalysts containing 2.4–15.2wt.% V2O5 content were prepared by wet impregnation technique using required amounts of ammonium metavanadate (Aldrich) dissolved in oxalic acid solution to impregnate CeF3. The excess water in the impregnated samples was evaporated to dryness on a water bath, oven dried at 120°C for 16h and finally calcined at 450°C for 6h. 2.2 Atomic absorption spectrometer The vanadium contents in the catalysts were estimated by using Perkin-Elmer-2380 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. The catalyst samples were decomposed in aquaregia and the resultant solution was diluted with double distilled water to known concentrations. 2.3 Pore size distribution measurements Measurements for specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the catalysts were made using Quantachrome, Autoscan-92 Porosimeter (U.S.A) by taking 300–500mg of sample. Accurate data acquisition was made with on line computer analysis. 2.4 Powder X-ray diffraction studies X-ray diffraction patterns of V2O5/CeF3 catalysts were recorded on a Philips PW-1140 X-ray diffractometer using Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation. In this technique a fixed wave length is chosen for the incident radiation and Bragg peaks are measured by observing the intensity of the scattered radiation as a function of scattering angle of 2θ, the inter planar distances or d-spacings are calculated and compared the data with the available ASTM cards to identify the phase composition in the catalysts. 2.5 FT-IR studies FT-IR spectra of the catalysts were recorded on Nicolet-740 FT-IR spectrometer. Self-supporting discs of the catalysts were prepared with KBr by applying pressure. These discs were used for recording FT-IR spectra. 2.6 BET-analysis BET surface areas of the catalysts were estimated using an all glass high vacuum system capable of attaining pressures as low as 10−6 Torr by the adsorption of N2 at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196°C). 2.7 Catalytic activity tests 3-Picoline ammoxidation runs were carried out in a fixed bed micro catalytic reactor. The reactor was built in-house with pyrex glass and heated in an electric furnace with temperatures ranging from 300 to 410°C. The reaction was performed at an atmospheric pressure with a molar ratio of 3-picoline: H2O:NH3:air = 1:13:6:44, at WHSV of 5.33gmol/h. The organic feed (3-picoline) mixed with water (1:13 molar ratio) was injected by means of an infusion pump. About 2g of catalyst was loaded in the reactor and then reduced in H2 flow at 450°C for 2h. Steady-state conditions were obtained after a few hours of reaction. An activity run was made without catalyst using diluents (glass beads), and found that the 3-picoline has not been converted, ruling out the surface volume reaction. The product stream was collected and analyzed by gas chromatograph, equipped with FID module with a column of 10% OV-17 on chromosorb W. The products were also analyzed and confirmed by GC-MS. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterisation The formation of CeVO4 compound was found in the calcined catalysts due to the interaction of V2O5 with the cerium atoms of CeF3 support during the course of the calcination. Several authors have prepared this compound by solid-state reaction of CeO2 and V2O5 in air [21–23]. It has also been reported that CeVO4 was obtained by the reaction between Ce3+ salts or its oxide and V2O5 under an inert atmosphere because of the instability of Ce3+ in air at high temperatures [24,25]. Several studies regarding the oxidation state of cerium in the CeVO4 has been reported unambiguously it is as Ce3+ [25–29]. CeVO4 crystallizes in a tetragonal zircon (ZrSiO4) type structure [30] and it is a p-type semiconductor [25,31,32]. The studies of Abi-Aad et al. revealed the Ce3+–V4+ segregates formation when treated at 800°C and their concentration became significant after a reduction treatment under hydrogen flow [33]. 3.2 Catalyst characterization 3.2.1 Surface area and pore size distribution studies Surface areas estimated by both BET and mercury porosimetric methods are compiled in Table 1 . The surface areas estimated by mercury porosimetric method are fewer than that of BET method, which may be due to unestimated micropore surface areas of the catalysts by mercury porosimetric method. The BET surface area of pure CeF3 is 33.9m2 g−1, which has continuously been decreasing with increased V2O5 loading, which may be due to blockage of pore mouths. Similar decreasing trend with increase in V2O5 loading has also been observed in both the surface area determination methods. The pore volume distributions of V2O5/CeF3 catalysts are presented in Fig. 1 . Pure CeF3 has a surface area of 33.9m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.41cm3 g−1. This material has a narrow pore volume distribution in the pore radius range from 6nm to 12nm, the highest pore volume distribution occurring at the dominant pore radius of 8nm (Fig. 1). Pore volume distribution curves of the catalyst reveal that V2O5 loading has highly pronounced effect on the pore-size distribution of these catalysts. When 2.4–7.8wt.% V2O5 is deposited on CeF3, the resulting catalysts are observed to exhibit pore volume distribution in the pore radius range form 10nm to 20nm, which is entirely different from the pore volume distribution from 6nm to 12nm of pure CeF3. When V2O5 loading has been increased to 10.7wt.%, the pore volume distribution shifts further to the higher pore radius range from 12nm to 50nm. When V2O5 content of the catalysts is further increased to 15.2wt.% the pore volume distribution is observed to shift to lower pore radius range, 9–20nm. The variations in the pore size distributions of the catalysts are reflected in the change of total pore volumes with variations in V2O5 loading. Pore volume increases from 0.223 to 0.319cm3 g−1 when the V2O5 content is increased from 2.4 to 10.7wt.% due to increase in pore size. When V2O5 content is further increased to 15.2wt.%, the pore volume is reduced to 0.293cm3 g−1 due to decrease in pore size. The total surface areas and the total pore volumes of pure CeF3 and V2O5/CeF3 catalysts are given below in Table 1. The pore volume distributions of pure CeF3 and the catalysts clearly reveal that these materials have pore structures in very narrow pore radius range. The contributions of individual pores to the total pore volume and surface area of the catalysts go on decreasing with increase in V2O5 loading. V2O5/CeF3 catalysts have exhibited a unimodel distribution of pore sizes. When V2O5 reacts with CeF3 support to form the compound CeVO4 the bonds of cerium atom to other atoms in CeF3 are broken and the isolated CeVO4 molecules form tiny crystallites. V2O5 might have reacted with and removed the surface layer or even sub-surface layer of cerium atoms and thus bring about an increase in the radii of the pores of the catalyst. This explains the shift of the pore-volume spectra of the catalysts to higher pore radius range till the V2O5 loading reaches 10.34wt.% (Fig. 1). When V2O5 loading is increased to 15.2wt.%, the pore volume distribution shifts to lower pore radius range from 9nm to 20nm. This shift of pore-size distribution to lower pore range is occurring due to decrease in the pore size as a result of formation of almost a close packed layer of CeVO4 compound on the walls of cylindrical pores. The dominant pore-size distribution of 15.2wt.% V2O5 catalyst is around 13nm. 3.2.2 X-ray diffraction The X-ray diffractograms of fresh and used V2O5/CeF3 catalysts are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. The X-ray diffractograms of the fresh catalysts contain moderately intense XRD peaks with characteristic d-values of 3.20, 2.01, 2.06, 1.81, 3.64, 3.58 and 1.75Å belonging to the crystal planes (111), (113), (300), (302), (002), (110) and (221) of CeF3 support (ASTM card no: 8-45). The intensity of the XRD peaks of CeF3 support has remained more or less the same with increase in V2O5 loading from 2.4 to 15.2wt.% (Fig. 2). This observation suggests that the surface of the support is not getting covered progressively with increasing V2O5 content of the catalysts. The XRD patterns of 2.4wt.% V2O5 catalyst exhibited very weak peaks of the compound, CeVO4 (d = 2.76 and 2.57Å). Very weak XRD peaks with d-values of 3.70 and 2.76Å belonging to crystal planes (200) and (112) of CeVO4 phase appear in the catalyst with 5.4wt.% V2O5. The intensity of the XRD peaks of CeVO4 with d-values of 3.70, 2.76 and 1.90Å belonging to crystal planes (200), (112) and (312) (ASTM card No: 12-751) increases gradually with increase in V2O5 loading up to 15.2wt.%. One can visualize an interesting phenomenon occurring on the catalyst surface as a result of interaction of increasing V2O5 content with atoms on the surface of CeF3 support. Deposited V2O5 is interacting with the surface of the support generating CeVO4 species which agglomerate to form CeVO4 crystallites and the crystallanity of these species is increasing with increase in V2O5 loading. Absence of XRD peaks of any of the oxides of vanadium in the diffractograms of these catalysts upto 10.7wt % V2O5 indicates that entire V2O5 has interacted with the cerium atoms of the support to form CeVO4 species. The CeVO4 species might have segregated and crystallized. The exposed CeF3 support appears to have more open structure with CeF3 in lower layers being exposed. A shift in the pore size distribution and an increase in pore volume has been observed with increase in V2O5 loading of the catalysts, which would lend support to the above explanation. The interaction of vanadia would have occurred not only with surface Ce atoms but also with Ce atoms in the sub-surface layers of the CeF3 support. When the V2O5 content has been increased to 15.2wt.% traces of free V2O5 have been identified in the X-ray diffractogram of the catalyst. Careful examination of the results of the X-ray diffraction studies of the used V2O5/CeF3 catalysts would reveal that the surface characteristics of the catalysts have been drastically modified during the course of ammoxidation reaction of 3-picoline (Fig. 2). The most striking feature of the X-ray diffractograms of used catalysts is that they contain the XRD peaks of support which are much more intense than the corresponding peaks in the diffractograms of fresh catalysts (Fig. 3) The X-ray diffractogram of used 2.4wt.% V2O5/CeF3 catalyst contains the most intense XRD peaks with d-values of 3.20, 2.01, 2.06, 3.64, 3.58, 1.81, 1.75 and 2.55Å belonging to the crystal planes of (111), (113) (300), (002), (110), (302), (221), and (112) of the support CeF3 (curve-a). When V2O5 loading is increased to 5.4wt.% the intensity of the CeF3 XRD peak has decreased and a weak XRD peak with a d-value of 4.89Å belonging to CeVO4 phase appears in addition to the XRD peaks of the support (curve-b). When the V2O5 loading is increased to 15.2wt.% the intensity of XRD peaks of the support, CeF3 is reduced gradually while the intensity of XRD peaks of CeVO4 phase (d = 3.70, 4.89, 2.76 and 1.90Å) has increased further (curves c–e). The changes in surface characteristics of the used V2O5/CeF3 catalysts can be attributed to modifications that occur in the surface structure of these catalysts under the severe reaction conditions. These results suggest that under the influence of water vapor, basic molecules and oxygen, the surface CeVO4 species would have diffused on the surface of the catalysts, coalesced and segregated into bigger CeVO4 crystallites. When this has happened these species leave a large surface of the support uncovered and the extent of uncovered surface decreases with increasing V2O5 content of the catalysts. This explains the decreasing intensities of the support XRD peaks and the increasing intensities of the peaks of CeVO4 crystallites in the used catalysts (Fig. 3). Consequently the structural modification and surface reconstruction accompanying catalysis on the support might have occurred to a greater extent in low V2O5 catalysts and this accounts for the higher intensities of XRD peaks of low V2O5 catalysts (Fig. 2). The observed results of XRD studies of V2O5/CeF3 catalysts seem to be reasonable and valid as the phenomenon of surface modification and reconstruction during adsorption and catalysis is well established [34,35]. 3.2.3 FT-IR studies The FT-IR spectra of the fresh and used V2O5/CeF3 catalysts are given in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. It is evident that the bands occurring at 3429, 2914, 2837, 2330, 1611–1639cm−1 and 773–801cm−1 are common in the spectra of both fresh and used catalysts. The band at 1724–1731cm−1 is present in the spectra of used catalysts with V2O5 loading from 2.4 to 5.4wt.% and in the spectra of all the fresh catalysts. The band at 3196cm−1 is present in the spectra of used catalysts at and above 7.8wt.% V2O5 loading. The band at 1386–1407cm−1 appears in the spectra of all the used catalysts. The band at 1006cm−1 is occurring in the spectra of fresh catalysts at and above 7.8wt.% V2O5 content. The band at 780–802cm−1 is weak in the spectrum of 2.4wt.% V2O5 catalyst (Figs. 4 and 5). Its intensity has abruptly increased when the V2O5 loading is increased to 5.4wt.% and persists in the spectra of all the catalysts. A band at 780cm−1 is also found in the spectrum of pure CeF3 (spectrum not shown here). The increase in the intensity of the band at 780–802cm−1 with addition of 5.4wt.% V2O5 may be ascribed to the formation of CeVO4 by the interaction of V2O5 with CeF3. Wachs et al. [36,37] have assigned the laser Raman band at 805cm−1 to the stretching vibrations of V–Ce–O species formed on V2O5/CeO2 catalysts. The three bands occurring at 3429cm−1, 2927cm−1 and 2837cm−1 appearing in the spectra of all the catalysts can be attributed to strongly adsorbed water on the surface of CeF3 support. The spectrum of pure CeF3 is found to contain highly intense bands at 2927cm−1 and 2837cm−1. These bands are highly suppressed when 2.4wt.% V2O5 is deposited on the CeF3 support and exists with very low intensities in the spectra of all the catalysts. The intensity of the broad band at 3429cm−1 and the intensity of the narrow band at 2337cm−1 have increased upto 7.8wt.% V2O5 and decreased above this loading. However, the intensity of the bands at 2927cm−1 and 2837cm−1 has continuously increased with V2O5 loading of the fresh (calcined) catalysts (Fig. 4). The band at 1611–1639cm−1 that exists on the surface of all the fresh catalysts may be assigned to deformation vibrations of strongly adsorbed water [38,39]. The band at 1006cm−1 can be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of VO bonds and the intensity of this peak increases with increase in V2O5 loading from 7.8wt.% to 15.2wt.%. The intensity of the band at 3429cm−1 increases when the V2O5 loading is increased from 2.4wt.% to 5.4wt.% and decreases above this loading in the spectra of used catalysts (Fig. 5) indicating decrease in OH group concentration on the surface of the used catalysts. The intensity of the band at 1618cm−1 decreases with increase in V2O5 loading. The band at 1386–1407cm−1 increase in intensity continuously with V2O5 loading. This band and the band at 3196cm−1 in the spectra of used catalysts with 7.8, 10.7 and 15.2wt.% V2O5 loading may belong to adsorbed NH4 + ions [20]. The narrow band at 2330cm−1 is prominent in the spectra of fresh catalysts (Fig. 4) and become weak in the spectra of used catalyst (Fig. 5). 3.3 Catalytic activity studies Ammoxidation of 3-picoline over all V2O5/CeF3 catalysts at different temperatures ranging from 300 to 410°C at atmospheric pressure in the vapor phase at the mole ratio of 3-picoline:H2O:NH3:air = 1:13:6:44 (W/F = 5.33gh/mole) produced mainly nicotinonitrile along with small quantities of pyridine, CO x and a trace amount of pyridine amide. Pyridine and CO x are produced directly from 3-picoline by oxidative demethylation or via nicotinonitrile and pyridine amide, in which nicotinonitrile gets converted in to pyridine amide by acid hydrolysis, hydrolysis of pyridine amide leads to the production of pyridine and CO x at the applied reaction conditions on the surface of the V2O5/CeF3 catalysts (Scheme 1 ). In order to find out the major reactant for the formation pyridine and CO x by-products in the system an experiment was conducted mixing the 3-picoline, nicotinonitrile, pyridine amide and water in accordance with the molar ratios of reaction effluents under similar reaction conditions and observed only a trace amounts of pyridine and CO x , which clearly indicates that the demethylated products are mainly from 3-picoline by oxidative demethylation. There is a striking balance (1:1 mole ratio) between the formed pyridine and CO x , which is an indication of CO x production, is only from the methyl group of 3-picoline, not from the total oxidation of 3-picoline (Scheme 1). Bondareva et al. [8] put similar observation forward in the ammoxidation of 2-methylpyrazine over V–Ti oxide system. Nicotinonitrile is the ammoxidation product of 3-picoline, in which one molecule of 3-picoline and one molecule of ammonia, and one half dioxygens are consumed for the production of one molecule of nicotinonitrile and three molecules of H2O, which indicates that the ammoxidation of 3-picoline is a six-electron redox process. It is reported that the ammoxidation of methyl aromatics or methyl heteroaromatics starts from the H-abstraction from the methyl group and forms a methylene-like (benzyl) species, which converts in to benzaldimine (RCH2 NH) intermediate either by dehydrogenation of intermediately generated benzylamine (RCH2 NH2 produced from benzyl species) or by dehydration of ammonia condensed-benzaldehyde [6,40]. Busca et al. reported that the nitrile could also be formed from benzaldehyde intermediate by its oxidation to corresponding acid with subsequent acid amide (RCONH2) formation and dehydration [41]. 3.3.1 Influence of V2O5 loading on the ammoxidation activity The influence of V2O5 loading on 3-picoline conversion, the yield of nicotinonitrile and the pyridine over V2O5/CeF3 catalysts is depicted in Fig. 6 . The conversion and the yield of nicotinonitrile have continuously been increasing with V2O5 loading, whereas the yield of pyridine has shown decreasing trend. The conversion at 2.4wt.% V2O5 loading is 57.9% and it attained a maximum value of 89.18% at 15.2wt.% V2O5 loading. The yield of nicotinonitrile is 37.87% at 2.4wt.%, which has steadily been increased to 81.92% as the loading of V2O5 increased to 15.2wt.%. The yield of pyridine decreased from 10.13 to 3.63% as the loading of V2O5 increased from 2.4 to 15.2wt.%, similar trend has also been observed in the case of CO x yield. The increase in the selective ammoxidation activity of the catalysts with increase in V2O5 loading can be attributed to the formation of more active phase, CeVO4. X-ray diffraction study of these catalysts has detected the formation of CeVO4 phase in the catalysts (Fig. 2). The intensity of the XRD peaks of CeVO4 phase is found to increase with increase in V2O5 loading. These results show that selective ammoxidation of 3-picoline may be occurring to a greater extent on CeVO4 phase. Pyridine formation is due to demethylation, which normally takes place on the acidic sites of the catalysts; since CeF3 is a strong Lewis acid its contribution towards dealkylation is inevitable at lower loadings. The progressive coverage of V2O5 on the surface of CeF3 decreased pyridine yields. The formation of CeVO4 phase modifies the base V2O5/CeF3 composition. The modification in general will have both electronic as well as structural consequences, but in the present case Ce3+ species exists leaving V5+ species in the CeVO4 phase [25,31]. Hence, isolation of V–O moieties by interposing of CeVO4 phase between V–O–V chains (site isolation at work) may be responsible for the high yields of nicotinonitrile at higher loadings of V2O5 on CeF3 support. Roussel et al. [42] reported that at higher loadings of Fe in the Fe1−x SbV x O4 structure, Fe substitutes V3+ by creating a vacancy which enhanced the selectivity to acrylonitrile in the ammoxidation of propane by isolating the active vanadia site and they also reported that the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple was not directly involved in the reaction mechanism but that Fe intervenes by changing the relative valence state of vanadium and the cationic and anionic assessment in the structure. 3.3.2 Influence of reaction temperature on the activity over15.2wt.% V2O5/CeF3 catalyst Temperature is found to have highly pronounced effect on 3-picoline conversion and the yield of nicotinonitrile and pyridine (Fig. 7 ). The increase in selective 3-picoline ammoxidation activity and the increase in pyridine yield with temperature can be ascribed to the increase in the intrinsic activity of the active sites on the CeVO4 phase and the acidic sites on the bare surface of the support, respectively. At 410°C, the catalyst has shown 84.78% nicotinonitrile and 5.13% pyridine yield respectively at a 3-picoline conversion of 91.3%. 4 Conclusions It is concluded that the non-conventional CeF3 supported V2O5 catalysts exhibit high conversions and selectivities in the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile. This high performance of these catalysts is ascribed to the formation of CeVO4 species during the catalyst preparation. The results of our preliminary investigation gives an impression that highly reactive V2O5/CeF3 or CeVO4-based ammoxidation catalysts can be prepared. Acknowledgement K.V.

The catalysts were characterized by BET surface area and pore size distribution, powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. It was found that the formation of Cerium Vanadate (CeVO4) occurs during the stages of the catalyst preparation. The X-ray diffraction studies of the catalysts revealed the presence of crystalline CeVO4 phase. The lines due to CeVO4 phase were found to increase in intensity with the increase in amount (wt.%) of V2O5 in the catalysts. The FT-IR investigation also showed the formation of CeVO4 phase with increasing loadings of V2O5. The shift of pore-size distribution to lower pore range and increased pore volume confirmed the formation of CeVO4 structure in the catalysts. The catalytic activity for the ammoxidation of 3-picoline to nicotinonitrile on V2O5/CeF3 catalysts as a function of V2O5 loading on CeF3 has been studied. The continuous increase of CeVO4 with V2O5 loadings is responsible for the higher ammoxidation activity of the V2O5/CeF3 catalysts.",
