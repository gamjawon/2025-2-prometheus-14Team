(+34 42)201402 (Received November 12, 1991; accepted September 21, 1992 ) Abstract The decomposition of palygorskite-, silica- and titania-supported rhodium catalyst precursors under helium and hydrogen is studied using thermal analytical methods: thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TGDSC ). Precursors have been prepared from an organometallic rhodium species, [Rh(nbd) (MeZCO)x]C104, and different supports. Supported rhodium (1) and -(111) are reduced under hydrogen at various temperatures from 448 K to 513 K depending on the support, producing active rhodium in a hydrogenation reaction. The reduction temperature observed is discussed from the viewpoint of metal-support interaction and therefore the acidity of the support. Catalytic activity in the gas-phase for 1-hexene hydrogenation was performed by catalysts reduced at two different temperatures; one at that determined by TGDSC, and the other at 673 K. All catalysts prepared present higher activities if they are reduced at their minimum reduction temperatures found by TGDSC than if they are reduced at 673 K. Key words: 1-hexene; hydrogenation; palygorskite; rhodium; supported catalysts Introduction One aspect of heterogeneous catalyst preparation is concerned with the reduction temperature of precursors at which the supported metal presents higher activity for a determined reaction [ 1 ] . The fact that catalytic activity depends on the pretreatment and the reduction temperature of precursors is well known [ 2-5 ] . In general, the lower the reduction temperature, the better is the activity of the metal obtained for structure insensitive reactions. This is probably because at higher reduction temperatures some metal sintering occurs. Prins et al. [6 ] have found clear evidence that Rh (III) supported on alumina is reduced at ca. 473 K. However, a higher temperature is usually applied to obtain a catalyst [ 7-9 ] . This behaviour is reversed in the structure sensitive reaction, but always the reduction temperature has an important influence on catalytic activity. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

All rights reserved. 166 J. Herrero et al./J. Mol Catal. 79 (1993) 165-174 Since the report by Yates and Sinfelt [ 10 ] , activity increases in hydrogenolysis reactions (structure sensitive reaction) have been observed when the reduction temperature of rhodium precursors is increased [8,11,12]. In other reactions, such as CO oxidation, an increase in activity is also observed when, for instance, the prior oxidation and reduction are performed at high temperatures [ 13 ] . In CO hydrogenation [ 14 ] the reduction temperature of rhodium catalyst precursors also influences catalytic activity. In contrast, it has often been deduced from the reduction temperature of a precursor that a low reduction temperature is associated with a low metalsupport interaction [ 15 ] . Clays have various properties which make them suitable as supports, viz., large specific surfaces and good adsorption capacities - palygorskite is unique in that it has wide three-directional porosity [ 16 ] . In fact, clays have been used extensively for immobilizing homogeneous catalysts. The resulting heterogeneous catalysts are active in hydrogenation reactions and more selective than their homogeneous counterparts [ 17 ] . The preparation of metallic particles on clays has been done by various methods [ 18,19 ] . In previous work [ 18,20,21 ] , catalyst precursors have been reduced in an acetone solution at room temperature, for hydrogenation in the liquid phase. In this study, the same precursors were reduced in the gas-phase for in situ hydrogenation reactions. The aim of the present work is to study the decomposition of rhodium species which are in various catalyst precursors under helium and hydrogen to determine the reduction temperature in the gasphase, The activity in the hydrogenation of 1-hexene is performed as a test reaction for catalysts reduced at ca. 473 K (reduction temperature determined by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TGDSC) for each catalyst). We have compared this activity with that of the catalysts reduced at the generally used reduction temperature of 673 K. Experimental Preparation of catalysts Palygorskite is a clay of the phyllosilicate family. Its structure is analogous to that of montmorillonite, which consists of talc-like ribbons arranged alternatively with channels along the fber axis. Transmission electron micrographs show packets of needles about 0.7-0.15 ~tm long and 0.03 ,um thick. The surface area, SBET, after evacuation at room temperature was 153 m2 g-1 and decreased to 71 m2 g-1 after degassing under standard conditions (140 C,10-4 Torr, 16 h). The total surface calculated from crystallographic data is about 700 m2 g-1 [22]; the difference between these values is due to the fact that N2 molecules do not diffuse into the palygorskite channels. Precursors were prepared by ion exchange of an organometallic rhodium species, [Rh(nbd) (Me2C0)X]C104, (0.1 mmol), (nbd-2,5-norbornadiene) J. Herrero et al./J. Mol Catal. 79 (1993)165-174 167 and the support (1 g) as described elsewhere [20,21], after evacuation of the support at different temperatures. A cationic rhodium compound, [Rh(nbd) (Me2C0)x]+ with perchlorate anion, which is easily reduced, was chosen in order to avoid leaching of the metal (the clay structure is negatively charged). The rhodium compound itself could be reduced under mild conditions. The reaction between the rhodium species and the evacuated support takes place in acetone solution. Such precursors are designated, for instance, [ Rh ] /paly-150 when the support has been evacuated at 150 C. Catalysts were prepared by reduction with a hydrogen flow of 6 cm3 min-1 over the precursors (5 mg) at a heating rate of 5 K min-1 and cooled in nitrogen flow, of 8 cm3 min-1. Prior treatment in nitrogen, at the same heating rate up to reduction temperature was performed to remove water from the support. The reactions that take place are: [Rh(nbd) (Me2C0)x]C104 0.1 mmol +support(CE) MezCO,Ar`[Rh]/support+(CE)C104 (1) 1 g precursor CE - cation exchange in palygorskite [Rh ] /support-~Hz,T Rhx/support precursor catalyst The rhodium content in the precursors is determined by the difference in rhodium complex concentration in the initial and the filtrate solutions, using UVVisible spectroscopy. The rhodium contents of catalysts have been deduced from percent weight loss of TG experiments. Both are given in Table 1. Temperature programmed decomposition Temperature-programmed decomposition was carried out in helium flow of 20 cm' min-1 at a heating rate of 5 K min-1 from 298 K to 1073 K. Catalyst precursors (10 mg) were placed in a crucible, part of a Setaram TGDSC 111 instrument.

Herrero et al./J. Mol Catal. 79 (1993) 165-174 Temperature programmed reduction . An experiment similar to that described in the above paragraph was performed. The only difference being that the gas flow was 5% hydrogen in helium at 20 cm' min-1. Hydrogenation of 1-hexene in gas phase Activity measurements were carried out at 298 K in a Pyrex microreactor part of a Setaram TGDSC 111 instrument in which the gases flow through the catalyst bed. Prior to this, the precursor (5 mg) was treated in nitrogen, at a heating rate of 5 K min-1 up to the temperature of reduction. Then, the precursor was reduced under hydrogen flow at the same heating rate of 5 K min-1, and maintained at the reduction temperature for five minutes. Following this, the catalyst so formed was cooled in nitrogen. Thereafter a hydrogen flow of 6 cm 3 min-1, which had previously been bubbled through a flask containing 1hexene (flask with 1-hexene was submerged in a bath at 298 K; pressure of 1hexene (298 K) -166 Torr (1 Torr -133 Pa); 1-hexene content in the flow=0.75 g cm-3), was passed through the microreactor. The outlet of the reactor was connected to a gas chromatograph fitted with an automatic valve for analysis of the samples. After two hours of 1-hexene conversion, the sample was treated in nitrogen up to 673 K, and then reduced at the same temperature. Hydrogenation of 1-hexene was carried out again. Samples were analyzed with a Varian GC, the column used was fss'-oxydipropionitrile on Chromosorb W, 80-100 mesh. Catalytic activity was measured as g hexane obtained per min, per g rhodium in catalyst. Results and discussion Decomposition followed by thermogravimetry TG profiles for the decomposition of supported rhodium precursors are shown in Fig. 1. The percentage of weight loss has been calculated for three sequential steps. Differences in water content for different precursors on palygorskite and treated palygorskite (palygorskite, palygorskite evacuated at 150 C and palygorskite evacuated at 400 C) are observed, as expected from the method of preparation of precursors. There are no significant differences between the palygorskite support and the precursor supported on natural palygorskite, [ Rh ] /paly. After decomposition, the colour of the sample is brownish orange for palygorskite support, ochre for titania and gray for silica, suggesting a lack of rhodium agglomeration on the two first supports and hence a better rhodium-support interaction for the palygorskite and the titania supports.

Reduction followed by thermograuimetry Figure 2 shows the results of the reduction of precursors followed by TG. The comparison between the reduction and the decomposition curves for each precursor (DTG), in Fig. 3, revealed the temperature at which rhodium loses its ligands (mainly 2,5-norbornadiene and acetone, other species such as water can also be lost ) and thus when metallic rhodium particles are probably formed. One well-defined peak was observed for each of the [Rh ] /Ti02, [Rh ] /Si02, and [ Rh ] /paly-400 precursors, as can be seen in Fig. 3. This temperature coincides with the highest hydrogen consumption of the sample detected with the temperature conductivity detector (TCD) of the gas chromatograph. For [ Rh ] /paly and [ Rh ] /paly-150, the weight loss due to rhodium ligands overlaps with that of water and the rhodium reduction temperature cannot be seen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) The comparison between temperature-programmed reduction profiles and temperature-programmed decomposition profiles for the heat flow of each precursor, indicates the rhodium reduction temperature. Table 2 shows the reduction temperatures for different precursors. A unique maximum ( or minimum ) 170 J. Herrero et al./J.

TG profiles for the temperature-programmed reduction of supported rhodium precursors by hydrogen. value in the heat flow is observed for [Rh ] /Ti02, [Rh ] /Si02, and [Rh ] /paly400 precursors, possibly due to the existence of only one rhodium species or a main rhodium species. Three maxima or minima have been observed for the [ Rh ] /paly and [ Rh ] /paly-150 precursors, probably due to the existence of at least three rhodium species on these supports. These facts coincide with previous results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [20,21] which showed that there was solely Rh ( I ) on the Ti02 support, mostly Rh ( I ) on the paly-400 support and Rh ( III ) but also some Rh ( I ) on paly and paly-150 supports (Table 2). Rh-support interaction: reducibility of rhodium precursors One of the factors that influences the reduction temperature of a supported catalyst precursor is the acidity-basicity of the support. The more basic the support, the lower the reduction temperature of the precursor. The sequence for reduction temperature (considering the highest temperature observed by TGDSC ) found in this work is: [ Rh ] /Ti02 < [ Rh ] / Si02 < [ Rh ] /paly-400 < [ Rh ] /paly < [ Rh ] /paly-150.

Precursors show the same order [ 24 ] . The reduction temperature of the precursors shows a dependence on support acidity, according to the above-mentioned hypotheses. The highest re- 172 J. Herrero et al./J. Mot Catal. 79 (1993) 165-174 duction temperature is shown by [ Rh ] /paly-150 precursor, where the support shows the highest acidity. Comparison of the reduction temperature with other Rh\"+/support precursors The reduction temperature found for [ Rh ] /Ti029 [ Rh ] /Si02 and [ Rh ] / paly-400 is similar to or lower than that found in the literature [6,25]. However, the temperatures of rhodium reduction found for the [ Rh ] /paly and [ Rh ] /paly-150 precursors (508 and 513 K, respectively) are higher than those of the other catalysts studied. In addition they are higher than those generally found for Rh (III) supported catalysts. This fact suggests that the rhodium complex interacts more strongly with paly and paly-150 supports than with other supports. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (refs. 20,21 Table 2) of these last two precursors indicate the existence of Rh (I) and Rh (III). Thus, the initial Rh (I) complex has been oxidized on paly and paly-150 supports, probably due to the high hygroscopic character of palygorskite in contrast with the other supports (palygorskite evacuated at 673 K does not adsorb water reversibly). One fact observed is the reversibility in the colour change of these two last precursors. The colour of the sample changes from pink to beige during drying, and from beige to pink on heating in vacuum at ca. 463 K. (The drying process of the precursors is due to elimination of acetone; this is the medium in which they have been prepared. Thus, precursors eliminate acetone and take water from the atmosphere in the drying process.) One of the factors that leads to these high temperatures ( > 473 K) of rhodium reduction on paly and paly-150 supports may be the acidity of these supports. In this context, Sachtler et al. [26] have found the reducibility of rhodium in some Rh/zeolites precursors to be largely controlled by the concentration of the surface protons: There is an incomplete reduction when the concentration of protons is high. Hydrogenation of 1-hexene The activity of the catalysts obtained is shown in Figure 4. A decrease in activity is observed when the temperature of reduction, after some turnover of 1-hexene has occurred, is increased. As found in previous work [ 18,20 ], the order of the activity of the precursors for 1-hexene hydrogenation in the gas-phase does not coincide with that of the activity in the liquid-phase of the same precursors reduced in the liquid phase at room temperature. This probably means that the reduction mechanism is different and that there are different rhodium species on the catalyst. Thus, once again, the dependence of pretreatments on the catalyst activity is shown. J. Herrero et al./J.

The decomposition of palygorskite-, silica- and titania-supported rhodium catalyst precursors under helium and hydrogen is studied using thermal analytical methods: thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TGDSC). Precursors have been prepared from an organometallic rhodium species, [Rh(nbd)(Me2CO) x ]ClO4, and different supports. Supported rhodium (I) and -(III) are reduced under hydrogen at various temperatures from 448 K to 513 K depending on the support, producing active rhodium in a hydrogenation reaction. The reduction temperature observed is discussed from the viewpoint of metal-support interaction and therefore the acidity of the support. Catalytic activity in the gas-phase for 1-hexene hydrogenation was performed by catalysts reduced at two different temperatures; one at that determined by TGDSC, and the other at 673 K. All catalysts prepared present higher activities if they are reduced at their minimum reduction temperatures found by TGDSC than if they are reduced at 673 K.
