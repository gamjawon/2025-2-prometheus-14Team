Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 1. Introduction Already in the early stages of research on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2hydrocarbons it became apparent that acid-base properties of the catalysts play an important role. Several authors [1-8] found that doping reducible metal oxides, e.g. alumina supported PbO with alkali compounds, or applying alkali and alkaline earth compounds of high basicity as well as their mixtures as catalysts, or using supports of different acidity/basicity significantly affect C2selectivity. In order to reveal the relationship between acid-base properties and C2selectivity different methods were applied in the characteri- zation of surface acidity and basicity, respectively. Bytyn and Baerns [6] determined the acidity of various support materials using the Benesi method [9] under ambient conditions and the isomerization of cyclohexene to 1-methyl- cyclopentene [10] at 773 K. The latter is known to be an acid-catalyzed probe reaction. Choudhary and Rane [11] studied the acid strength distribution of rare-earth oxides by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, whereas surface basicity was measured by stepwise thermal desorption of CO2 [11,12], a method specially developed for the quantitative analysis of base strength distri- bution. However, equivalent information can be obtained with the usual temper- ature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, which was predominantly used to characterize the surface basicity of metal oxide catalysts for the OCM reaction [13-15]. Furthermore, probe reactions have been mentioned [16,17] as suitable for determining the acid-base properties of solids under reaction conditions which are close to those of the catalytic reaction under consideration. Using the decomposition of 2-propanol to acetone and propene for characterizing the surface basicity and acidity of La203/CaO catalysts Becker and Baerns [18] found that the maximum of propene formation rate which is indicative for a) OH ~HzC:CH'CH3 +H20 H3C_~_ CH3 propene ' 9, H .c.id ~\" H3C_C_CH3 +H2 b~se 2-prop(ano[ oce lone b) OH 0 0 I II bQ~ II (CH3}z-C-CHz-C-CH3 . \" 2 H3C-C-CH3 diace lone atcohol, ace lone Fig. 1.

Baerns/Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 109 acidity coincided with the maximum in C2+ selectivity of the OCM reaction. No correlation was observed between the acetone-to-propene ratio as a measure of surface basicity and C2selectivity. Since the relationship between surface basicity/acidity and C2+ selectivity of the OCM reaction is still not fully understood, especially in the case of multi-component catalysts, the acid-base properties of several catalysts based on CaO, which had already been tested in the OCM reaction, were compara- tively investigated in the present study. For this reason, different methods were applied in order to get more detailed information not only about the general surface basicity/acidity, but also about the number of basic surface sites, their base strength distribution as well as the type of basic and acidic surface sites. 2. Methods for characterizing acid-base properties 2.1. Probe reactions (1) From the decomposition of 2-propanol (IPA) to acetone (A) and propene (P) measures of basicity and acidity were derived. The reaction pathways are illustrated in Fig. la. Since IPA needs an acid-base pair to be converted to acetone, the acetone-to-propene ratio reflects the basicity, whereas the propene- formation rate is solely due to the acidity. (2) The retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol (DAA) is mentioned [19] to be solely catalyzed by basic sites. There- fore, this probe reaction was chosen for determining surface basicity indepen- dently of acidity. The catalytic activity for the formation of acetone (Fig. l b) can be used as a direct measure of basicity. 2.2. C02-TPD/ benzoic acid titration Quantitative information on the number of basic surface sites and the base strength distribution were obtained by the temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 and the benzoic acid titration using a series of Hammmett-indicators in the range 8.2 ~< H ~< 26.5. The base strength H is defined in Eq. (1). BH represents a neutral acid adsorbed at the catalyst surface and B- is the conjugated base. H = pKBH + log[B-]/[BH] (1) 2.3. FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFT) DRIFT spectroscopic experiments were performed in order to reveal the type of adsorption structure of CO2. A measure of base strength was obtained from the reciprocal value of the difference of the asymmetrical and the symmetrical stretching vibration of the unidentate carbonate [20] which was formed due to 110 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 CO2 adsorption. The type of acidic sites (BrCnsted and/or Lewis) on LazO3/CaO catalysts was determined by pyridine adsorption. 3. Experimental The following catalysts were applied: alkaline earth metal oxides MgO, CaO and SrO La203 and La203 (x at.-% La)/CaO (x = 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 27, 50, 80) CeO2 and CeO2 (X at.-% Ce)/CaO (x = 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95) NaOH (11 mol-%)/CaO and Zn2+ (x at.-%)/NaOH (11 mol-%)/CaO (x = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1). 3.1. Preparation The alkaline earth metal oxides MgO (Fluka, 99.95%), CaO (Alfa Products, 99.95%) and SrO (Alfa Products, 99.5%) were calcined at 1173 K (SrO: 1373 K) in ambient air for 24 h. In order to obtain La203/CaO catalysts La203 (Fluka, 99.98%) and CaO were mechanically mixed in the presence of water. The catalyst precursors were dried at 393 K for 20 h and subsequently pressed to pellets. The pellets were then calcined at 1173 K in air for 24 h. CeOz/CaO catalysts were obtained by the coprecipitation method. After adding a sufficient amount of oxalic acid (1.0 M) to an aqueous solution of desired concentration of Ca(NO3)2 (Riedel-de Haen, > 99%) and Ce(NO3)3 (Fluka, > 99%) the mixture was stirred for 2 h; it was then left for 12 h for complete coprecipitation. The coprecipitate obtained was separated by filtration and dried at 393 K for 4 h; finally it was calcined at 1173 K in ambient air for 24 h. Zn(NO3)z.4H20/NaOH (1! mol-%)/Ca(OH)2 catalyst precursors were prepared by dry impregnation of Ca(OH)2 (Fluka, > 99.5%) with an aqueous solution of NaOH (J.T. Baker, 98.3%), subsequent drying at 393 K and further impregnation with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)24H20 (Merck, 98.5%). In order to avoid moisture of the catalyst surfaces with CO2 and H20, all catalysts were stored in a desiccator filled with argon. For studying the acid-base surface properties each catalyst sample was heated at 1123 K in a stream of dry nitrogen (VsTp = 30 ml min- l) for 5 h prior to an experiment. The Zn(NO3)24HzO/NaOH/Ca(OH)2 precursors were calcined in situ at 1023 K in a stream of dry nitrogen (Vsvp = 25 ml rain-I) for 18 h (see above). 3.2. Physicochemical characterization 3.2.1. Surface area The specific surface areas were measured by the 1-point BET method using nitrogen adsorption at low-temperature (77 K). P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 111 3.2.2. Surface composition The surface composition was determined by XPS in a LHS-10 spectrometer (Leybold Heraeus) using an A1 K o~ X-ray source. After non-linear background substraction the energy spectra were fitted by deconvolution based on Gauss and Lorentz functions. The sensitivity factors by Wagner et al. [21] were applied. 3.2.3. Bulk composition Bulk composition of powdered La203/CaO catalysts was obtained by XRD (Cu K ce radiation). 3.3. Characterization of acid-base properties 3.3.1. Decomposition of 2-propanol This reaction was carried out at 573 ___ 1 K in a microcatalytic fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. The feed consisted of 2.5% IPA (J.T. Baker, >~ 99%) and 97.5% dry nitrogen. The flow-rate was 23 mlsvP min-t and conversion of 2-propanol was ~< 10% in all experiments. Product analysis was performed by gas chromatography with a 30 m Fused-Silica-QS capillary column linked to a flame ionisation detector. The column was run isothermally at 393 K. 3.3.2. Retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol Catalytic activity measurements were carried out at 323 +_ 1 K in a magneti- cally stirred liquid phase suspension of the catalyst. DAA (Merck-Schuchardt, > 98%) was solved in 40 ml of cyclohexane resulting in a 0.05 M (0.1 M in case of MgO) DAA solution. The reaction rate was obtained by following the consumption of DAA with time. Samples of the reaction mixture were taken and analysed by gas chromatography with a 50 m OV-101 capillary column linked to a flame ionisation detector. The column was operated isothermally at 353 K. Catalyst activity could be characterized by the first-order rate constant per unit surface area. The reproducibility of both reactions ((3.3.1) and (3.3.2)) was checked experimentally, and the measurements were repeated 2-3 times. The relative error was 10% for the partial pressure of acetone and propene, respectively, 20% for the acetone-to-propene ratio, and 15% for the first-order rate constant of the conversion of diacetone alcohol. 3.3.3. TPD of CO2 For the TPD measurements a DSC 111 calorimeter (Setaram) connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass PC, VG Quadrupoles) was used. In order to remove adsorbed H20 and CO2 from the catalyst surface prior to measurements, the samples were heated from room temperature to 1050 K in a stream of helium (99.999%, 20 ml min--~) and cooled down to room tempera- ture after 30 min. Using pulses of CO2 the catalyst surface was saturated with 112 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 CO2. Physically adsorbed and excess gas-phase CO2 were removed by flushing the samples in a stream of helium for 30 min. TPD profiles were obtained by heating the samples from 300 to 900 K (SrO, Zn2+/NaOH/CaO catalysts were heated from 300 to 1050 K, the maximum temperature that could be achieved, since desorption of CO2 started at higher temperatures) with a constant rate of 20 K min-~ in a stream of helium (20 ml min-~) and measuring the CO2 concentration in the effluent as a function of temperature. From the amount of CO2 desorbed the total number of basic surface sites was calculated and the temperatures of the desorption rate maxima were used as a measure for the base strength. Hereby, the assumption was made that one CO2 molecule interacts with one basic surface site. This assumption is supported by the fact that at room temperature CO2 predominantly is adsorbed in the form of the unidentate carbonate as revealed by DRIFT spectroscopy (see below). 3.3.4. Benzoic acid titration Benzoic acid titration experiments were performed in a drybox filled with argon. The method corresponds to the n-butylamine titration according to Benesi [22]. The indicators used are listed in Table 1, together with their colors and pKBH values. Each indicator was dissolved in dry benzene (Fluka, >/99.5%) for the preparation of 0.1 wt.-% solution. The pretreated catalyst samples of definite weight were covered with 5 ml of dry cyclohexane (Fluka, >~ 99.5%). For the titration 0.01 M (0.05 M) solutions of benzoic acid (Merck, 99.95- 100.05%) in cylohexane were added with a micropipet. Hereby, the amount of benzoic acid was increased in steps of 0.1 mmol g-l, and 1 mmol g-~ in the case of MgO. After vigorous shaking at room temperature for 4 h each sample was distributed to seven sample glasses, and into each of them two drops of one of the indicator solutions were added. The end point of titration was determined visually from the resultant color changes, where basic colors just disappear. 3.3.5. DRIFT spectroscopy Infrared studies were performed in the range 4000-400 cm-1 with a diffuse reflectance accessory from Spectra Tech (model 0030-102) which was attached Table 1 Hammett indicators used for the benzoic acid titration Indicator Base strength Color (H_) (BH) (B-) Phenolphthaleine 8.2-9.8 colorless pink Thymolphthaleine 9.3-10.5 colorless blue 2,3,4-Trinitroaniline 12.2 yellow reddish-orange 2,4-Dinitroaniline 15.0 yellow purple 4-Chloro-2-nitroaniline 17.2 yellow orange p-4-Nitroaniline 18.4 yellow yellow-orange 4-Chloroaniline 26.5 colorless pink P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 113 to a Perkin-Elmer 1710 FTIR spectrometer. To obtain spectra of the solid materials in ambient air 5 wt.-% of each catalyst were mortared with KBr (Riedel-de Haen, for spectroscopy). Spectra were recorded in the absorbance mode with 50 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-~ using powdered KBr as a reference. Background absorptions of the catalysts were always subtracted from the original spectra. The recorded diffuse reflectance spectra were corrected to Kubelka-Munk units. Adsorption of pyridine was studied on LazO3/CaO catalysts with 1, 27 and 80 at.-% lanthanum. The catalysts were mortared in an atmosphere of argon and filled into the DRIFT cell equipped with ZnSe windows. Traces of CO~ and H20 on the catalyst surfaces were removed by heating the samples up to 1073 K (maximum of temperature) in a stream of 20 ml min-~ of dry nitrogen (99.999%) for 30 min. In a saturator the nitrogen carrier gas was loaded with pyridine (Merck, >~ 99.5%) at room temperature and flushed over the catalyst sample for 15 rain. The adsorption step was followed by flushing with nitrogen at room temperature until no further changes in the spectra were observed. In order to facilitate a comparison of the different catalyst systems measures of basicity and acidity, the total number of basic sites and the number of basic sites of different strength always are related to the unit of catalyst surface area. 4. Results 4. I. Physicochemical characterization The BET surface areas of the various catalyst systems, their surface composi- tions as well as their electronegativities are listed in Table 2. From the surface composition it becomes evident that nearly a homogeneous mixture of CaO and CeO2 could be obtained by the coprecipitation method, whereas mechanical mixing of La203 and CaO led to an enrichment of La203 on the catalyst surface at a lanthanum bulk content below 50 at.-%. The observed amount of surface zinc (on the average 0.7 at.-%) indicates that almost all zinc is present in the near-surface region of the Zn2 +/NaOH/CaO catalysts. Electronegativities EN were calculated with respect to the surface composi- tion of the catalysts applying the equation (2Z + 1)EN0 = EN~ [23] (Z = valency of the metal cation, EN0 = electronegativity of the neutral atom) in order to determine the electronegativity of a single metal cation. For catalysts consisting of La203/CaO the crystalline phases solely observed by XRD were CaO and La203. 4.2, Decomposition of 2-propanol 4.2.1.

Alkaline earth metal oxides CO2-TPD profiles illustrated in Fig. 7 show the desorption rate of CO2 per unit catalyst weight and surface area, respectively, as a function of temperature. For SrO a sharp desorption peak occurs at 1030 K, while for CaO a more symmetrical desorption signal was observed at a lower temperature of 820 K. Two overlapping desorption peaks at 420 K and 620 K were obtained for MgO indicating the existence of two different types of basic surface sites. From the temperature of desorption rate maxima the following base strength order could be derived: SrO > CaO > MgO. The total number of basic surface sites de- creases in the same order (see Table 4). 118 P. Kiiflner, M.

La203 / CaO catalysts The CO2-TPD profile of La203 illustrated in Fig. 8 reveals two overlapping desorption peaks at 680 K and 740 K having a peak area ratio which seems to be approximately 2:1. In contrast to CaO desorption of CO2 occurs at a signifi- cantly lower temperature (see also Table 4). However, CO2-desorption peaks of La203/CaO catalysts are in the same temperature range as in the case of CaO. With increasing lanthanum content the desorption peak at 840 K grows, hereby becoming narrower. Furthermore, two shoulders occur, one at 740 K for catalysts with 0.5, 1, 3 and 10 at.-% lanthanum, the other at 840-850 K for catalysts with 10, 27 and 50 at.-% lanthanum.

Further desorption of CO2 was observed under isothermal conditions (1050 K). Since the baseline was not regained, the desorbed amount of CO2 as well as the total number of basic surface sites could not be calculated. Because of the similar position and shape of desorption signals it might be concluded that these catalysts show nearly the same base strength and base strength distribu- tion, respectively. 4.5. Benzoic acid titration with Hammett indicators The total number of basic surface sites is summarized in Table 4, while the base strength distribution, i.e., the amount of basic sites per unit surface area determined for certain ranges of base strength H, is given in Table 5. 4.5.1. Alkaline earth metal oxides MgO has the highest amount of weak basic sites in the range 8.3 ~< H_ ~< 12.2, while on SrO very strong basic sites (18.4 ~< H_~< 26.5) and on CaO strong and medium strong basic sites (15 ~< H_~< 18.4) predominate. The total number of basic surface sites (see Table 4) decreases in the order MgO > CaO > SrO, whereas the amount of strong basic sites in the range 17.2 ~< H ~< 26.5 shows the opposite tendency. 122 P.

La2 03 / CaO catalysts Similar to CaO strong and medium strong basic sites prevail on the catalyst surfaces. At a lanthanum content between 10 and 80 at.-% an increasing amount of strong basic sites (18.4 ~< H_~< 26.5) was observed. These surface sites, however, do not exist on catalysts with 0.5, 1 and 3 at.-% lanthanum. An increasing lanthanum content goes along with a slight decrease of the total number and the number of strong basic surface sites, respectively (see Table 4). 4.5.3. Zn2 + / NaOH / CaO catalysts Zn2 +/NaOH/CaO catalysts show almost the same base strength distribution. With respect to the maximum error limits given in Table 4 the total number of basic surface sites does not differ significantly. In comparison with the other catalyst systems highest amounts of strong basic sites (17.2 ~< H_~< 26.5) were found. 4.6. DRIFT spectroscopic measurements 4.6.1. Alkaline earth metal oxides In the DRIFT-spectra of CO2-adsorption two strong absorption bands oc- curred in the range 1414-1495 cm-1. These twin bands were assigned to the P. Kiifiner, M. Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 123 symmetrical and asymmetrical OICO~ stretching vibration of the unidentate carbonate [24-27]. The reciprocal value of the difference of ua~ and U,y indicates an increasing base strength in the order MgO < CaO < SrO as may be seen from Table 4. 4.6.2. La20~/ CaO catalysts DRIFT-spectra detected for CO2-adsorption on La203/CaO catalysts also showed the asymmetrical and symmetrical OICO~ stretching vibration of the unidentate carbonate at 1383-1485 cm-I [24-27]. With increasing lanthanum content base strength represented by the reciprocal value of the difference of v~ and V,y decreased (see Table 4). However, base strength of catalysts with 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 27 and 50 at.-% lanthanum does not differ significantly. Adsorption of pyridine resulted in absorption bands of the coordinatively bound pyridine at 1598 and 1443 cm-I [28], thus indicating that only Lewis acid sites (Ca2+, La3+) exist on the catalyst surfaces, whereas BrCnsted acid sites can be excluded. 4.6.3. Zn2 + / NaOH / CaO catalysts DRIFT spectra detected for CO2-adsorption revealed a strong absorption band at 1447-1452 cm-1 which can be assigned to the O~CO~ stretching vibration of the unidentate carbonate [24-27]. No splitting into the asymmetrical and sym- metrical vibration was observed, thus base strength of these catalysts could not be calculated. Weak bands at 1776 and 1163 cm-I may be ascribed to the bridging carbonate [29]. 5. Discussion In the following, measures of basicity and acidity obtained with different methods are comparatively discussed. The relationship between catalyst compo- sition and acid-base properties as well as the applicability of the characteriza- tion methods are considered. TPD of CO2, benzoic acid titration and DRIFT spectroscopy among others deliver information on the strength of basic surface sites. Thus, for better comparison these three methods always are discussed commonly. 5.1. Alkaline-earth oxides 5.1.1. Probe reactions An increase of surface basicity in the order MgO < CaO < SrO is revealed by decomposition of 2-propanol and retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol. This is in agreement with the theoretical consideration that basicity of a metal oxide increases with decreasing electronegativity of the metal cation (see Table 2). 124 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 5.1.2. TPD of COe / benzoic acid titration / DRIFT spectroscopy With respect to the base strength CO2-TPD profiles and benzoic acid titration measurements resulted in the same tendency (MgO < CaO < SrO), whereas opposite trends were obtained in the total number of basic surface sites (see Table 4). Generally benzoic acid titration delivers a higher total number of basic surface sites than temperature-programmed CO2-desorption. Alkaline earth oxides have NaCl-type structure. In order to value on the above findings, the number of basic 02- sites of a (100) surface plane of a NaC1 crystal is calculated for comparison. Table 4 shows, that the calculated values correspond well with the results of benzoic acid titration, while the total number of basic surface sites determined by CO2-TPD measurements is signifi- cantly lower. The main reason for these differences might be ascribed to the fact that the equilibrium titration method also covers those weak basic surface sites, from which CO2 molecules might be flushed away during dynamic and station- ary TPD experiments, because of lower acid strength of CO2 (pKa = 6.35, [30]) in comparison with benzoic acid (pKa = 4.19, [31]). This becomes evident from the fact that with decreasing basicity of the alkaline earth oxides the difference in the total number of basic sites between CO2-TPD and titration measurements increases. The base strength order found by TPD of CO: and benzoic acid titration is confirmed by DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO2. From the good correspondence in surface basicity obtained by different methods it can be concluded that these methods in principle are applicable to characterize the basicity of metal oxides. Nevertheless, as will be outlined below deviations might occur, the more complicated the catalyst composition is. 5.2. Lae03/ CaO catalysts 5.2.1. Probe reactions / DRIFT spectroscopy In comparison with the results of Becker and Baerns [18] basicity obtained from the decomposition of 2-propanol in this work is much higher, whereas surface acidity is in the same order of magnitude. Since Becker and Baerns determined lower values of base strength when using Hammett indicators, it may be assumed that a part of the basic surface sites was blocked by traces of CO2 and H20, thus diminishing dehydrogenation activity. Dehydration activity on the other hand was almost not influenced. Low surface basicity of catalysts with 27, 50 and 80 at.-% lanthanum, which was observed by decomposition of IPA and retroaldolisation of DAA, can be related to the fact that although strong basic sites are present (see Tables 4 and 5), its number and also the total number of basic sites have decreased drastically with increasing lanthanum content. In contrast to the decomposition of IPA, retroaldolisation of DAA results in lower surface basicities for catalysts with a lanthanum content of 0.5, 1 and 3 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 125 at.-% in comparison with CaO. Since retroaldolisation of DAA depends not only on the number, but also on the strength of basic sites [t9], the absence of basic sites in the range 18.4 ~< H_~< 26.5 is assumed to be responsible for this difference. When comparing both probe reactions, it further has to be considered that in the case of the retroaldolisation of DAA surface basicity could be measured directly, whereas a ratio of two formation rates was used as a relative measure of surface basicity in the decomposition of IPA, i.e., experimental accuracy in determining the low propene formation rate strongly influences the ratio of the two formation rates. Taking into account that Gervasini and Auroux concluded from their experiments [32] that contrary to the catalytic dehydration of 2-propanol the dehydrogenation solely depends on the number of sites, but does not depend on their strength, this probe reaction seems to be of restrictive applicability in investigating the basic character of the catalysts. Acidity of La203/CaO catalysts is of Lewis-type nature (La3 +, Ca2 +) as was clearly demonstrated by DRIFT spectra of pyridine adsorption. The increase of surface acidity with increasing lanthanum content, as was revealed by decompo- sition of IPA, is due to the higher electronegativity (see Table 2) of La203 which results in stronger acidic sites. In the boundary region of the two oxides low-coordinated strong basic and acid surface sites might be created. This might be the reason for the higher surface acidity of La203/CaO catalysts with a high lanthanum content compared to pure La203. 5.2.2. TPD of CO2 / Benzoic acid titration / DRIFT spectroscopy CO2-desorption profiles revealed that on catalysts with 0.5, 1, 3, 10, 27 and 50 at.-% lanthanum the basic properties of CaO are dominant since the main desorption peak of CO2 corresponds to that of pure CaO. The shoulder at 740 K can be related to the influence of lanthanum. As a further consequence of doping CaO with small amounts of lanthanum (< 10 at.-%) the base strength distribu- tion of these catalysts is much narrower indicating that the catalysts are better crystallized than pure CaO, i.e., the solid surfaces are more homogeneous. This is also evident from benzoic acid titration experiments. From literature [33,34] it is known that CaO/La203 mixed oxides can form a solid solution by solid state reaction up to a solubility limit of 15 mol-% CaO. Therefore, incorporation of CaO into the near surface region of the lanthanum oxide lattice during catalyst calcination might result in a more heterogeneous surface with low coordinated strong basic 02 anions. This was confirmed by DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO2. The two CO2-desorption signals detected for La203 correspond to the two types of oxygen anions in the lanthanum oxide lattice [35,36]: 2/3 of oxygen anions in the layers of complex cations (LaO)i'+ refer to T, na~ = 680 K, while 1/3 stronger basic oxygen anions in the hexagonal layers can be related to Tmax = 740 K. With benzoic acid titration generally higher amounts in the total number of basic surface sites were determined for La203/CaO catalysts in contrast to the 126 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 temperature-programmed CO2-desorption. This might be ascribed to the same reason as has been outlined for alkaline earth oxides. 5.3. CeO2 / CaO catalysts 5.3.1. Decomposition of 2-propanol With increasing cerium content a slight increase in surface basicity was observed, which might be related to the creation of low-coordinated oxygen anions in the boundary region of the two oxides. The decrease of the acetone- to-propene ratio at a cerium content higher than 70 at.-% is not only a result of the changes in the acid-base properties, but might also depend on electrical properties. From literature [37] it is known that CaO/CeO2 mixed oxides form a solid solution by solid-state reaction up to a solubility limit of 20-25 mol-% CaO. Since incorporation of lower valent Caecations into the cerium oxide lattice resulted in a negative charge accompanied with the formation of oxygen- anion vacancies, coordinatively unsaturated metal cations are also formed. These sites might act as acidic sites, thus leading to a strong increase of the propene formation rate and a drastical decrease of the acetone-to-propene ratio, respec- tively. Dehydrogenation reaction is not only controlled by basicity, but also by the electronic mobility as is envisaged in a number of publications [38-40]. Therefore, the unexpected high dehydrogenation activity of ceria is not due to an increase in surface basicity, but can be related to the fact that this oxide is a metal excess, n-type semiconductor [41]. With increasing CaO content electronic conductivity decreases and also oxygen-ion conductivity occurs [37]. 5.3.2. TPD of CO2/benzoic acid titration From TPD measurements it is evident that an increasing CeO2 content led to a decrease in the total amount of basic surface sites as well as to the appearance of basic sites of minor strength. However, some COe-desorption signals at 740-790 K and around 900 K can neither be related to CaO nor to CeO2 as in the case of the La203/CaO catalysts. Therefore it can be assumed that different types of basic sites are formed in the boundary region of the two oxides which are influenced by both types of metal cations: the occurrence of low-coordinated strong basic oxygen anions (Tmax = 900 K) in the boundary region was consid- ered to be responsible for the slight increase of surface basicity with increasing cerium content which was revealed by the 2-propanol decomposition. In com- parison with the LaeO3/CaO catalysts the occurrence of more than two CO2 desorption signals might depend on the existence of Ce3+/Ce4+ at a higher cerium oxide content as well as on the preparation method. 5.4. Zne +/ NaOH/ CaO catalysts The enrichment of NaOH on the catalyst surfaces resulted in extremely low specific surface areas. In consideration of the maximum experimental errors P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 127 acid-base properties determined by the 2-propanol decomposition and the retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol are supposed not to differ significantly. This assumption is supported by the fact that all CO2-desorption profiles of Zn2+/NaOH/CaO catalysts show nearly the same temperature of desorption rate maximum, thus indicating a similar base strength. Therefore, it can be concluded that doping with very low amounts of Zn2cations does not affect the acid-base properties significantly. 5.5. Comparison of the various catalyst systems Highest surface basicity and base strength, respectively, were observed for SrO and Zn2+/NaOH/CaO catalysts which is in agreement with the low electronegativities of the metal cations (see Table 2). An increasing electronega- tivity of the metal cation generally led to a decrease in surface basicity, while surface acidity is enhanced. For some catalysts differences in the acid-base properties were observed in spite of similar electronegativities, e.g. CaO ob- tained by calcining the commercial oxide or by precipitation as oxalate, La203 (50 at.-% La3+)/CaO and CEO2(30 at.-% Ce4+)/CaO, MgO and La203 (27 at.-%)/CaO. This might result from the fact that the basicity of surface and bulk is not necessarily the same, because of morphological changes either in the boundary regions between two oxides or caused by incorporation of cations. 6. Conclusions From the various methods applied to study the basicity and acidity of metal oxide catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane a comprehensive picture of the acid-base properties was derived. The retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol, the temperature-programmed desorption of CO2, the benzoic acid titration and DRIFT spectroscopic investigations are suitable characterization methods for the surface basicity. In the case of the 2-propanol decomposition it has to be considered that misleading information about the basicity are possible, espe- cially when other factors than the acid-base properties, e.g. electronical proper- ties, influence one of the two reaction pathways. Therefore, this probe reaction is assumed to be of restrictive applicability in determining the basicity of certain metal oxides. It further turned out that probe reactions only reveal the general tendency of surface basicity and acidity as a function of the catalyst surface composition. However, application of further complementary methods is necessary in order to get more detailed information about that relationship as became obvious from the results of the CO2-TPD, benzoic acid titration and DRIFT experiments. Acid-base properties of mixed metal oxides are influenced by the electroneg- ativities of the metal cations: catalysts having a high amount of strong elec- 128 P. Kiiflner, M. Baerns /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 107-129 tronegative metal cations, e.g. CeO2/CaO with a high cerium content and La203 with a high lanthanum content, show higher acidities than SrO and ZnZ+-doped NaOH/CaO. Very small amounts of acidic metal cations, however, have only little effect as was observed for ZnZ+/NaOH/CaO catalysts. Furthermore, morphological changes of mixed oxides either due to incorpora- tion of metal cations into the crystal lattice of the main component or in consequence of the formation of boundary regions between the different oxides might strongly affect the basicity and acidity, e.g. low-coordinated strong basic O2- sites are created on a more heterogeneous catalyst surface. Due to differences between surface and bulk acid-base properties, basicity and acidity as a function of catalyst composition might pass through maxima and minima as was observed for La203/CaO and CeOz/CaO catalysts.

A comprehensive study of the surface basicity and acidity of alkaline earth metal oxides, La2O3/CaO, CeO2/CaO and ZnO-doped NaOH (11 mol-%)/CaO which had earlier been tested as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane was performed. For determining the acid-base properties two probe reactions, i.e., the decomposition of 2-propanol to acetone and propene and the retroaldolisation of diacetone alcohol, further the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, the benzoic acid titration with Hammett indicators and DRIFT spectroscopic investigations of the adsorption of CO2 and pyridine were applied. Using alkaline earth metal oxides as references the applicability of the different characterization methods was evaluated. The decomposition of 2-propanol was found to be of restrictive applicability for determining the basicity of a metal oxide. A comparison of the different catalyst systems revealed that La2O3/CaO and CeO2/CaO catalysts showed highest surface acidities, while highest base strength and highest amount of strong basic surface sites were observed for Zn2+/NaOH (11 mol-%)/CaO catalysts and SrO.
