The influence of the type of support preparation on the thermostability of the CeO,/BaO/AlzO3-supported Pd catalysts and on their activity for oxidation of CO was investi- gated. The CeO,./BaO/A1203-supported Pd catalyst prepared by the complexing agent-assisted sol- gel method showed much higher thermostability than the other two catalysts. The activity order was complexing agent-assisted sol-gel > impregnation > kneading in terms of CO oxidation after 1000 calcination. The properties of these catalysts were also investigated by X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Of the three methods, the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method gave a much higher dispersion of Ce3 + than the other two methods. It was found that the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method is the most effective in improving the thermostability of the CeO,/ BaO/Al203-supported Pd catalysts.

Masuda et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 59-65 alysts consist of three principal components: supports, precious metals and additives such as cerium oxide [2,3]. One drawback of these catalysts is that they tend to undergo thermal deactivation caused by surface area reduction of the supports, sintering of the precious metals and crystallization of additives such as cerium oxide [4]. It has been reported that the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method is effective for preparing thermostable aluminas [5 ] and that alumina synthesized from alu- minium isopropoxide using 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol as a solvent has a high ther- mal stability [ 6,7 ]. We have also reported that an iridium catalyst supported on this alumina shows higher catalytic activity for the decomposition of hydrazine than conventional catalysts [8] and that platinum and palladium catalysts supported on the alumina show higher activity for the oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane than conventional catalysts [9]. On the other hand, it is well known that baria is an effective additive for improving the thermal stability of alumina [ 10-12] and Ce is commonly included in automobile exhaust gas purification catalysts for other purposes [ 13]. However, the influence of the type of preparation on the thermo- stability of CeOx/BaO/A1203 supports has not been investigated sufficiently. Fur- thermore, Pd supported catalysts have not been investigated, either. In this work, we have prepared CeO~/BaO/A1203 supports using two conven- tional procedures (impregnation and kneading) and a complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method (chemical mixing procedure). The thermostability of these CeO~/ BaO/AlzO3 supports containing Pd is investigated and the relationship between tb~ catalytic activities and the properties of the catalysts is discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of CeO/BaO/Al203 supports CeOx/BaO/Al203 supports were prepared using two conventional procedures (impregnation and kneading) and a complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method (chemical mixing procedure). The sol-gel CeOx/BaO/A1203 (sample A) was synthesized using 2-methylpen- tane-2,4-diol (MPD) as a complexing agent. The preparation of CeOJBaO/A1203 is described below as a typical example (Fig. 1 ). First, 60.4 g of aluminium sec.- butoxide was put in a 500 ml beaker. To this, 1.7 g of acetylacetonato barium dihydrate and 25 g of 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol (MPD) were added. The beaker was placed in an oil bath at 100 and stirred for 3 h. Meanwhile, 1.75 g Ce(NO3)3 \"6H20 was put in a 300 ml beaker. To this, 12 g of C2HsOH solution containing 2.23 g of acetylacetonato barium dihydrate was added. The beaker was put into an oil bath at 150 and stirred for 3 h. Subsequently, the temperature of the oil bath was lowered to room temperature and the contents of the beaker were K.

The beaker was put into an oil bath at 100 and stirred for 3 h, after which 17 g of water was added. The beaker was maintained at 100 for l0 h to obtain a gel. The gel was transferred to an kjeldahl type flask and dried under reduced pressure. The dried gel was heated at 250 for 3 h and calcined at 450 for 4 h and at 1000 for 3 h to yield a pale yellow alumina powder. Other CeOx/BaO/A1203 supports were prepared as follows. An impregnated CeOx/BaO/A1203 (sample B) was prepared by conventional impregnation of Ce(NO3)3\" 6H20 and Ba(NO3)2-6H20 into a sol-gel alumina made by the com- plexing agent-assisted sol-gel method [9]. After drying overnight at 110, the nitrates were decomposed by calcination in air at 600 for 2 h. The kneaded CeOx/ B aO/A1203 (sample C) was prepared by kneading the three oxides. The composite was calcined at 600 for 2 h. 2.2. Preparation of Pd catalysts The 0.8 wt.-% Pd/CeOx/BaO/A1203 catalysts were prepared by impregnating the supports with an aqueous solution of Pd(NO3)E(NH3)2. The metal contents of these catalysts were measured by atomic absorption analysis. To evaluate the thermostability of the catalysts, they were calcined at 1000 for 20 h before measuring the catalytic activity. 2.3. Surface area measurements The specific surface area was determined by the BET method from N2 adsorption data at - 196 using a Micromeritics AccuSorb 2100. 62 K, Masuda et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 133 (1995) 5945 2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements The XRD patterns were obtained on a MAC Science MXP-18 instrument using Cu Kc~ radiation with Ni filter. 2.5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements The XPS measurements were made using a pumped VG ESCA Lab MK II electron spectrometer which had a base pressure of 10- lO Torr ( 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa). 2.6. Activity of the catalysts CO oxidation reactions over the alumina-supported Pd catalysts (0.10 g) were carried out in a conventional fixed bed flow-type reactor. The catalysts were first treated in a hydrogen stream with a flow rate of 100 ml/min at 400 for 1 h, and then the reaction gas, a mixture of CO, 02 and He in a ratio of 0.5:0.25:99.25, was allowed to flow through the catalyst bed. The effluent gas was led directly to the sampling valves of a gas chromatograph for analysis. The catalytic activity was calculated from the CO conversion. 3. Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows results for the CO oxidation over the CeOx/BaO/A1203-supported Pd catalyst made by the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method (catalyst A), the CeOx/BaO/Al203-supported Pd catalyst made by impregnation (catalyst B) and the CeOx/BaO/A1203-supported Pd catalyst made by kneading (catalyst C), all calcined at 1000 for 20 h.

XPS spectra of Ce 3d on the CeOJBaOIAIEO3-supported Pd catalysts by the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method showed a much higher thermo- stability than the other two catalysts. The activity order was catalyst A (the com- plexing agent-assisted sol-gel method) > catalyst B (impregnation) > catalyst C (kneading). The following investigations were carried out to elucidate the reasons for the differences in conversion efficiencies with respect to the A1203, Pd and Ce states. It is well known that a change of alumina structure is often accompanied by a change of surface area [9] and Pd state is determined by the Pd dispersion. First, the specific surface areas of the three Pd/CeOx/BaO/A1203 catalysts were meas- ured by the BET method. The values for catalysts A, B and C were 115 m2/g, 105 m2/g and 94 m2/g, respectively. The activity ranking of the three catalysts does correspond to the surface areas, but the differences in surface areas are small. Second, the Pd dispersion of each catalyst was measured by the CO adsorption method. The value for all three catalysts A, B and C was 0.07 CO/Pd. Accordingly, from these results it was difficult to discern the reasons for the differences in conversion efficiencies. The Ce oxide crystallite size of the three Pd/CeOx/BaO/ A1203 catalysts was measured by XRD. The values for both catalysts A and B were 145 A, while the value for catalyst C was 600 ,~. It is seen that the Ce crystallite size of catalyst C is larger than those of catalysts A and B. These results suggest that Ce oxide crystal growth occurs much faster in catalyst C than in catalysts A and B. It is deduced that the low activity of catalyst C is mainly due to a lesser redox interaction between Pd and Ce due to large cerium oxide crystals. Next, the catalysts were investigated using XPS with respect to the Ce and Pd. Fig. 3 shows the Ce XPS spectra of the three Pd/CeOx/BaO/A1203 catalysts in 64 K.

XPS spectra of Pd 3d on the CeOJBaO/Al203-supported Pd catalysts comparison with the spectra of CeO2(Ce4+) and CeC13 (Ce3+). It appears that catalyst A contains roughly equal amounts of Ce4 + and Ce3 + and that the amount of Ce3 + in it is more than in catalysts B or C. Accordingly, from these results it is concluded that catalyst A has more highly dispersed Ce3+ in the alumina. As reported by Toba et al. [ 14], the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method gave homogeneous titania/silicas. It is deduced that the complexing agent-assisted sol- gel in this study also gave more homogeneous supports. Furthermore, the Pd states of the three catalysts were investigated further using XPS. Fig. 4 shows Pd XPS spectra of the three Pd/CeOx/BaO/AI203 catalysts. The peak of catalyst A is about 336.3 eV, while the peaks of catalyst B and C are about 336.8 eV. Thus, the state of Pd in catalyst A is more reduced than that in the other two. It is deduced that the origin of the high activity of the Pd/CeOx/BaO/A1203 made by the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method is highly dispersed Ce3 + and a more reduced Pd state in the alumina. 4. Conclusion A CeOx/BaO/A1203-supported Pd catalyst by the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method showed much higher thermostability than CeOx/BaO/A1203-sup- ported Pd catalysts by impregnation or by kneading. The activity order was complexing agent-assisted sol-gel > impregnation > kneading in terms of CO oxidation. Of the three methods, the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method gave much higher dispersion of Ce3 + than the other two catalysts. The CeOx/BaO/ A1203 by the complexing agent-assisted sol-gel method is concluded to be one of the most thermostable ones for automotive catalysts. Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Y.
