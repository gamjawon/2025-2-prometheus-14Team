Hong and E. Ruckenstein* Department of Chemical Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 (USA) (Received January 28, 1992; revised June 3, 1992) Abstract Linear bifunctional copolymers were prepared by the free radical copolymerization in solution of a phosphine ligand (3- and 4-vinylbenzyl-biphenylphosphine (VBBP) or 3,4bis(diphenylphosphine)-1-butene (BDPB) with an excess amount of a quaternary onium salt (vinylbenzyl tributyl ammonium chloride (VBAC)). The copolymer bicatalysts P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) or P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC) were prepared by attaching palladium complexes to the pendant phosphine ligands. The Heck coupling reactions of iodobenzene with acrylate esters in DMF were employed to investigate the cooperation of the catalysts located on the copolymer by comparing their catalytic activities to those obtained with systems in which the two catalytic groups are not assembled together. It was found that the former exhibit higher catalytic activities than the latter, and that the P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) system provides a higher product yield than P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC). The results also suggest that the polymer blocks of quaternary ammonium groups in the copolymers constitute receptors for the reactants. The amounts of phosphine, onium salt and palladium in the copolymer catalysts were determined by elemental analysis; 3'P NMR experiments were carried out to investigate the distribution of phosphine in the copolymer chain. Introduction If a catalytic system involves co-catalysts, the probability of finding one in the neighborhood of the other plays a crucial role in the smooth chemical transformations of the intermediates to the final products [1]. The high catalytic efficiency of enzyme systems is based on the concerted mechanisms of substrate-binding and catalytic conversion that take place among spatially separated active sites on flexible biopolymer chains [2]. The concept of concerted catalysis [3] has long been employed to improve known catalytic systems as well as to design novel ones. Here we present a simple and effective method for improving the cooperative catalytic functions of palladium-phosphine complexes and quaternary onium salts in the Heck [4] vinylation reaction by locating them on different units of a copolymer. The close proximity of the two kinds of catalytic units provides a reaction *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$05.00 1992 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved 274 microenvironment different from that of two catalysts free in solution. This copolymer bicatalyst was prepared by free radical polymerization in solution of a phosphine ligand (3- and 4-vinylbenzyl-biphenylphosphine (VBBP) or 3,4-bis(diphenylphosphine)-1-butene (BDPB)) with an excess amount of a quaternary onium salt (vinylbenzyl tributyl ammonium chloride (VBAC)). The two kinds of copolymers are denoted as P(VBBP-VBAC) and P(BDPB-VBAC), respectively. Subsequently, palladium was attached to the copolymer (P(VBBP-VBAC) or P(BDPB-VBAC)) through the formation of complexes with the phosphine ligands. The reactions of iodobenzene with three kinds of acrylate esters (butyl acrylate (BA), 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA)) were carried out in DMF containing a soluble copolymer bicatalyst (P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) or P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC)). The results were compared to those obtained for systems with separate co-catalysts, such as: low-molecular-weight catalysts (PPh3)2Pd(OAc)2 and Bz1N+(n-Bu)3C1-; linear poly(quaternary ammonium salt) and palladium phosphine complex (P(VBAC) and (PPh3)2Pd(OAc)2); and the two kinds of homopolymer catalysts (P(VBBP-Pd) and P(VBAC)). The copolymer bicatalysts exhibit much higher catalytic activities than the separate co-catalyst systems listed above. In addition, they allow an easy separation of the copolymer catalysts after reaction by their precipitation with water The results of these experiments suggest that the polymer blocks of quaternary ammonium salt constitute not only a co-catalyst but also loci for the adsorption of reagents. Catalytic copolymer chains with different architectures [51 can generate different microenvironments, and the selection of the adequate architecture can optimize the cooperation among various catalytic groups. Experimental Reagents Vinylbenzyl chloride (Kodak, p or p & m mixture) was distilled under vacuum to remove the inhibitor. Chlorodiphenylphosphine (Aldrich, tech.), lithium ribbon (Aldrich, 99.99'0), tributyl amine (Aldrich, 999'0), 3,4-dichloro1-butene (Aldrich, 98%), iodobenzene (Aldrich, 999'0), butyl acrylate (Aldrich, 99 + %), ( )-2-ethylhexyl acrylate (Aldrich, 98ss'o), butyl methacrylate (Aldrich, 99%), palladium diacetate (Aldrich, 980/6), triphenylphosphine (Aldrich, 999'0), and the organic solvents employed were used without further purification. Instrumental analysis The vinylation products were analyzed by HPLC (ISCO-2350 pump /ISCOV4 detector): 4.6 mm x 250 mm column filled with Adsorbosphere Cg, 5 gm, as the solid phase; CH3CN/H20 (v/v= 7.3) as the mobile phase; 248 nm as the UV detector wavelength; and trans-methyl cinnamate (Aldrich, 99%) as the chromatographic standard for quantification. Elemental analyses 275 were performed by Quantitative Technologies (Bound Brook, NJ). 1H and \"P NMR spectra of the vinylation products and the copolymers were recorded on a VXR-400 (400 MHz) or a GEM-300 (300 MHz) spectrometer. Preparation of polymer-supported catalysts Synthesis of the phosphine ligand nwnomers (3- and 4 vinylbenzyl-biphenylphosphine (VBBP) and 3,4 bis(diphenylphosphine)-1-butene (BDPB)) Chlorodiphenylphosphine (5.0 g, 22.6 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of lithium pieces (237 mg, 34 mmol) in THF at room temperature under a N2 atmosphere. After most of the lithium pieces had dissolved, the red Ph2PLi solution was extracted with a syringe and added slowly to a stirred solution of either vinylbenzyl chloride (3.0 g, 20 mmol) or 3,4-dichloro-l-butene (1.25 g, 10 mmol) in 10 ml THF under a N2 atmosphere. The red color of Ph2PLi disappeared as soon as it was added. The resulting solution was stirred for an additional half hour and then vacuumconcentrated by evaporating the THF. The phosphine monomer (VBBP or BDPB) precipitated when 50 ml ethanol were introduced and the solution was refrigerated. After filtration and drying, 2.2 g of VBBP or 1.18 g of BDPB were obtained. Synthesis of vinylbenzyl tributyl ammonium chloride (VBAC) This quaternary onium salt was synthesized according to a reported method [6]. Synthesis of copolymer P(VBBP-VBAC) and of the bicatalyst P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) VBAC (1.69 g, 5 nunol), VBBP (0.16 g, 0.5 mmol) and 12 mg of AIBN were dissolved in 10 ml CH,C12. The solution was subjected to ultrasonic treatment under a nitrogen flow for a few minutes, and subsequently allowed to copolymerize under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 h at 50-55 C. To precipitate the copolymer, the copolymer solution was poured into ethyl ether. The copolymer was purified twice by being dissolved in chloroform and precipitated with ethyl ether. Finally, the precipitate was vacuum dried. Elemental analysis of the copolymer P(VBBP VBAC) obtained indicated a quaternary ammonium salt content of 2.35 mmol per g of copolymer, and a phosphine content of 0.22 nunol per g of copolymer. 1.0 g of P(VBBP-VBAC) was further dissolved in 20 ml CH2C12, and a solution of Pd(OAc)2 (0.053 g, 0.2 mmol) in 10 ml CH2C12 was added under stirring. The red color of Pd(OAc)2 in CH2C12 faded away shortly after addition. After stirring 0.5 h, the yellow copolymer containing two kinds of catalytic species was separated by pouring the solution into benzene. The bicatalyst was purified three times by being dissolved in CHC13 and precipitated in benzene. Elemental analysis indicated that the copolymer bicatalyst P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) contains 0.076 mmol of Pd per g of polymer. 276 Synthesis of the copolymer P(BDPB-VBAC) and of the bicatalyst P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC) VBAC (3.38 g, 10 mmol), BDPB (0.46 g, 1 mmol) and 24 mg of AIBN in 20 ml CH2C12 were employed for the synthesis. The preparation method was the same as that used in the synthesis of P(VBBP-VBAC). Elemental analysis of the P(BDPB-VBAC) prepared indicated 2.29 mmol of quaternary onium salt per g of copolymer and 0.17 mmol of phosphine per g of copolymer. The method from the previous section, involving 2.0 g of P(BDPB-VBAC) and 0.11 g of Pd(OAc)2, was used to prepare the copolymer bicatalyst P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC), which contains 0.072 mmol of Pd per g of polymer. Synthesis of P(VBBP) and P(VBBP Pd) 3- and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (1.53 g, 10 mmol) and 10 mg of AIBN in 10 ml CH2C12 were polymerized under a NZ atmosphere at 50-55 C for 20 h. The linear poly(VBC) obtained (1.0 g, 0.65 mmol of Cl) was treated with an excess of Ph2PLi in THF. The resulting poly(VBBP), which contains 3.3 mmol of P per g of polymer, was dissolved in 20 ml CH2Cl2, and then a solution of 0.05 g Pd(OAc)2 (0.22 mmol) in 10 ml CHZCl2 was added dropwise under stirring. The system was further heated at 40-50 C for 1 h. The phosphine-palladium complex polymer precipitated owing to the crosslinking generated by the coordination among the Pd ions. This polymer was subsequently purified by being washed with benzene. The PCVBBP-Pd) contains 1.02 mmol of Pd per g of polymer. Synthesis of P(VBAC) VBAC (7.0 g, 21 mmol) and 10 mg of AIBN in 20 ml CHZCIZ were polymerized at 50 C for 20 h. The polymer was precipitated with THF. The subsequent purification involved dissolution in CHC13 and precipitation with THF. The P(VBAC) contains 2.90 mmol of N per g of polymer. Palladium-catalyzed vinylation reaction of iodobenzene with ac7ylate esters (BA, EHA and BMA) under phase-transfer catalysis conditions Synthesis of alkyl (butyl, 2-ethylhexyL) cinnamate To a 25 ml round-bottom flask, 1.0 g of a fine powder of KZC03, 0.2 g of P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) (containing 0.47 mmol of pendant benzyl tributyl ammonium chloride and 1.5 x 10-2 mmol of palladium-phosphine complex, P/Pd = 2.9), 10 ml of dry DMF, 1.67 g of iodobenzene (8.1 mmol) and 0.96 g of butyl acrylate (7.5 mmol) were added. The reaction took place in an oil bath at 55-60 C for 20 h, under stirring and N2 atmosphere. After reaction, about 50 ml water was added to the mixture, and the dark brown polymeric catalyst that precipitated instantly was separated using a Buchner funnel. The filtrate was extracted with ether (3 x 15 ml), and the separated polymeric catalyst was washed with 20 ml ether and filtered again. The organic phases were combined and the ether was evaporated in the hood at room temperature. The residue was vacuum evaporated (ca. 10 5 mmHg 277 at room temperature for BA, and at 40-50 C for EHA and BMA) overnight to remove the unreacted reagents. Finally, 1.40 g of an oil-like liquid was obtained and identified by 'H NMR as butyl cinnamate with traces of impurities. The yield was 93% (based on the amount of BA used). The isolated polymeric catalyst can be reused after drying. Kinetic study of the vinylation reaction catalyzed by four different catalysts: P(VBBP Pd-VBAC); (Ph3P)2Pd(OAc)2 plus BzIN+Bu3Cl-; P(VBBP Pd) plus P(VBAC); and P(VBAC) plus (PhjP)ZPd(OAc)Z For these four catalytic reaction systems, 0.002 equivalents of pendant phosphine palladium complex, 0.63 equivalents of pendant benzyl tributyl ammonium chloride, 1.0 equivalent of butyl acrylate and 1.06 equivalents of iodobenzene were employed. The other reaction conditions were as in the previous section. Results and discussion The palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction of acryl halide with olefins under solid-liquid phase-transfer conditions [ 7 ] constitutes an improvement over the Heck-type reaction, since the reaction occurs under milder conditions and the yield and stereoselectivity are increased [8]. Previous results suggest that the phase-transfer reagents such as quaternary onium salts function as co-catalysts in addition to transferring the solid base to the solution [9]. In the present exi.. -invents, free radical polymerization in solution was employed to prepare the ph,rsphine-quaternary ammonium copolymers. The distribution of the monomer units obeys known statistical laws [ 10 ]. Two kinds of random copolymers, namely P(VBBP-VBAC) and P(BDPB-VBAC), were obtained. Since the feed contained an excess of VBAC over the phosphine monomer (mole ratio = 1011), the VBAC blocks are certainly longer than the phosphine blocks. Consequently, the copolymer chain contains relatively longer blocks of VBAC units interspaced by much smaller phosphine blocks. The resulting sequence provides a microenvironment for the phosphine ligand that is different from that existing in - ~ homopolymer. This is supported by comparison of the 3'P NMR chemical shifts of P(VBBP) and P(VBBP-VBAC) in DMSO-d6 solvent (Fig. 1). The former has a chemical shift of -3.969 ppm, while that of the latter is - 6.521 ppm. If P(VBBP-VBAC) were a block-copolymer, then the chemical shift would be close to that of P(VBBP). Since the chemical shift is very different, it is clear that P(VBBP-VBAC) is a random copolymer in which the microenvironment of phosphine is different from that in its homopolymer. The special catalytic reaction environment provided by a copolymer in which palladium-phosphine complex units are randomly distributed among blocks of poly(VBAC) (Fig. 2) was found to promote the catalytic activity for vinylation of iodobenzene with acrylate esters. The results with respect 278 (b) Fig. 1. 3'P NMR spectra (161.9 Hz) of polymerized p-vinylbenzyl-diphenylphosphine in DMSOds: (a) P(VBBP) and (b) P(VBBP-VBAC) with a mole ratio of N/P=8.2.

The catalytic activities exhibit the following sequence: (i) > (ii) > (iii) > (iv). The fact that copolymer bicatalyst (i) possesses a higher activity than the low-molecular-weight bicatalyst (ii) is the result of two structural factors. The blocks of poly(VBAC), which have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, interspaced by smaller blocks of phosphine-palladium complex in P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) play the role of a receptor for binding the hydrophobic 279 80 70 60 a ss SO m 40 0 U d 30 20 10 t t 0 2 4 6 8 10 Copoly.

This effect is enhanced by the electrostatic interaction between the N+ units and the quadrupoles of the aromatic ring of the iodobenzene [ 1 b ]. The coordination catalytic sites of phosphine-palladium complexes and the blocks of poly(VBAC) are located in close proximity to each other in the P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC). This facilitates the migration of the bound substrates to the coordination catalytic sites. The other two bicatalytic systems, (iii) and (iv), display similar activities, which are lower than those of (ii) because the diffusion of the polymers is slower and hence the probability of a chemical encounter is smaller. c -CH=C(CH3)C02CH2CH3 1 c -CH2C(CH 2)C02CH~CH2CH2CH 3 2 lc lb c ,h 11 _CH=C(CH2C6H5 )CO2 CH2CH2CH2CH3 7 6 2c Fig. 4.

When butyl methacrylate and iodobenzene were used as reactants, and (i) (P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC)), (ii) ((Ph3P)ZPd(OAc)2 and Bz1N+Bu3CI-) and (iii) ((Ph3P)ZPd(OAc)2 and P(VBAC)) as catalysts, three kinds of products were obtained (Scheme 1, Fig. 4). Product 2 (butyl 2-benzyl acrylate) was obtained with a lower yield than product 1 when the low-molecular-weight bicatalytic system (ii) was employed. In contrast, almost equal amounts of 1 and 2 were obtained when the copolymer bicatalytic system (i) was used. The bicatalytic system (iii) also generated comparable amounts of 1 and 2. In the presence of unsupported quaternary onium salt and Pd complex [91, the ratio of products 1 to 2 is around 1/0.3, whereas in the absence of the phase-transfer reagent [ 12 ] the ratio is around 1/0.08. The above results indicate that the generation of 2 is favored by the quaternary onium ions, particularly when they are bound to the polymer chains. The quaternary ion probably mediates the elimination of 3-Ha from Pd-alkyl species (Scheme 2) [ 13 ]. As for product 3, it results from the further addition of iodobenzene to product 2. Reactions of iodobenzene with the acrylate esters were also performed using the soluble copolymer bicatalyst P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC). After reaction, 282 the catalysts can be precipitated by adding water. Table 1 compares the results with those obtained when the P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) catalyst was employed. The primary reasons for the reduction of the yield of butyl cinnamate when P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) is successively used may be (a) the loss of the low-molecular-weight fractions of the copolymer, and (b) the loss of palladium due to decomposition. The catalyst P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) has a higher product yield than P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC). This may be a result of the distribution of the pendant phosphine units in the copolymer chain. Elemental analysis indicated that the mole ratio of ammonium to phosphine groups in both catalysts was close to 10:1. The distribution of phosphine groups in the polymer chains of P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) is likely to be more uniform than in the polymer chains of P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC), because according to the Q, e empirical method of Alfrey and Price [ 101, one can predict that VBBP has a stronger tendency than BDPB to copolymerize with VBAC.

The Heck coupling reactions of iodobenzene with acrylate esters in DMF were employed to investigate the cooperation of the catalysts located on the copolymer by comparing their catalytic activities to those obtained with systems in which the two catalytic groups are not assembled together. It was found that the former exhibit higher catalytic activities than the latter, and that the P(VBBP-Pd-VBAC) system provides a higher product yield than P(BDPB-Pd-VBAC). The results also suggest that the polymer blocks of quaternary ammonium groups in the copolymers constitute receptors for the reactants. The amounts of phosphine, onium salt and palladium in the copolymer catalysts were determined by elemental analysis; 31P NMR experiments were carried out to investigate the distribution of phosphine in the copolymer chain.
