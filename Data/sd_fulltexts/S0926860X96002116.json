Box 77, Budapest, H-1525, Hungao, Received 5 February 1996; revised 20 May 1996; accepted 6 June 1996 Abstract Low and high activity states in the carbon dioxide vs. inlet temperature transient curves in the catalytic combustion of m-xylenes over Pd2NisoNba8 amorphous alloy ribbons (I), Pd/stainless steel flakes (II) and Pd/clinoptilolite (III) samples have been investigated. In addition, in both states hysteresis, in high activity state self-sustained oscillation in the CO2 vs. time at full conversion and damped oscillation at low conversion were observed over samples (II) and (III). It was established that hysteresis is a general phenomenon in both states and is not affected by the catalyst structure, but it can be ascribed to Pd as active component. Transition between the low and high activity state may be due to change in the PdO structure as was indicated by XPS studies. Oscillation is indicative of the partial accumulation of carbonaceous deposits over the catalysts at full conversion, while damped oscillation might be a result of the change of local concentration due to overheating the catalyst sample during combustion.

Introduction High activity states in the oxidation of methane which were developed on ageing of alumina supported palladium catalysts have been observed by Primet and co-workers [1,2]. For this phenomenon an increase in the metal particle size as possible explanation was suggested by the authors. Recent studies by Garbowski et al. [3] indicated reconstruction of the palladium crystallites during the catalytic oxidation of methane, namely, development of the Pd(200) faces * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(96)00211-6 96 L. Bork6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 which were more active than the Pd(111) facets. This result pointed out that not only the size, but rather the structure of palladium surface is the prevailing cause for the activity change. On the other hand, Farrauto et al. [4] observed a change in the stability of the Pd:O species which depended on the temperature regime, support and other factors. The authors suggested that in the oxidation PdO species is important and by changing the temperature the Pd/PdO ratio is altered. Similar ageing phenomena have also been found by Shinjoh et al. [5] over Pd and Pd/Rh catalysts on which the rate of NO decomposition increased over aged catalysts. Low and high activity states in the CO2 vs. temperature curves have also been observed in the oxidation of methane by McCarty [6]. The first order rate constants within the 450-750 temperature range were higher in the temper- ature ramps up than in the ramps down the cycle. The effect was explained by a higher activation energy for the diminished amount of oxygen chemisorbed on metallic palladium and by the suppressed reoxidation of palladium metal relative to PdO decomposition. Furthermore, the author found an activation of the catalyst after heating-cooling cycle as the same rate was measured at a temperature by about 50 lower after than before the cycle. The phenomenon observed was explained with the different reactivities of the various surface species, such as chemisorbed oxygen, half oxidized palladium and bulk PdO. Moreover, metastable surface complexes, such as PdO2, PdO(OH)e were as- sumed to be present on the surface which decomposed between 350 and 550. However, crossing in the first order rate constants in the 420-560 temperature range in the heating-cooling cycle was not discussed. Hysteresis in the oxidation of m-xylene over palladium containing amorphous ribbon (I) [7] and on palladium supported on stainless steel flakes (II) [8] below 400 was also observed where the CO2 conversion was higher during the ramp down cycles. The problem we are addressing in this paper, is whether in the oxidation of m-xylene the transition between the low and high activity states are associated only with palladium itself as major catalyst component, or it is a consequence of the catalyst morphology due to the various forms of palladium in Pd2NisoNb48 amorphous alloy ribbons (I) Pd/stainless steel flakes (II) and Pd/clinoptilolite (III). The choice of these three samples was necessary to attempt to separate the effects of mass and heat transport (on samples (I) and (II) these effects are missing) from the morphology changes of palladium surface. It is also well known that when a catalyst is in a transient state the hysteresis mentioned here [6] and in earlier papers [7,8] coexists with oscillation. This phenomenon is well known for CO oxidation over Pt single crystal [9,10], for NO + NH3 reaction over Pt foil [11] under certain conditions (temperature, pressure and composition). The second goal of these studies is to find out whether or not in m-xylene oxidation over palladium catalysts oscillation can also be developed. L. Bork6 et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 97 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Pd2NisoNb48 amorphous alloy ribbons (I) were prepared by melt spinning and etched in 40% HF solution before the reaction [7]. The palladium supported on stainless steel (46% Fe, 23% Cr, 31% Ni) catalyst (II) was prepared by electroless deposition of about 0.02 wt.-% Pd from the PdC12 solution and was used without any further treatment [8]. Pd/clinoptilolite (III) was prepared by impregnation of the 0.5-1 mm size fraction of the natural zeolite with Pd(NO3)2. It resulted in an egg-shell type palladium containing catalyst of 3.2 wt.-% Pd loading on the outer surface of the grains and of 0.7 wt.-% Pd as an average composition. 2.2. Catalyst characterization X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using a KRATOS XSAM cpi machine in F.A.T. mode was applied to measure the surface state of palladium and the formation of Nb205 observed with the simultaneous partial crystallization of the ribbon. As we are dealing with catalysts in oxidized form, a special in situ cell was not necessary to apply. Details about changes during the pre-treatment and after the catalytic reaction are given elsewhere [7]. The surface concentration of palladium on the Pd/stainless steel catalysts was about 40 at.-%. Besides palladium, chromium and iron oxides were also detected in the surface layers, but no Ni was found [8]. The Pd/PdO was measured by the Pd 3d peak composition as only XPS offered information about the palladium concentra- tions on the surface. For all samples O ls and C ls transitions were measured. In the Pd/clinoptilolite catalyst Si 2p and A1 2p transitions were also measured. The binding energies were referenced to C ls at 284.5 eV binding energy. X-ray diffraction was measured by a Philips diffractometer using CuK~ in a Guinnier chamber. An effort to estimate the number of surface palladium atoms by pulse chemisorption of CO or H2 (D2) in a flow system was not successful because of the low metal loading and of the large size of Pd particles indicated by XRD. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was applied to measure the sur- face carbonaceous deposits. Oxygen pulses (100 ixl) were introduced in a helium stream at a linear ramp of 20 rain- 1 and the effluent was monitored by a thermal conductivity (TC) detector. Simultaneously, a quadrupole mass spec- trometer was used to measure the m/e = 32 and 44 peaks which are indicative of the oxygen disappearance and carbon dioxide formation. 2.3. m-Xylene oxidation The catalytic tests were carried out in a quartz tubular plug flow reactor of 8 mm internal diameter with inconel shielded thermocouples before and after the 98 L. Bork6 et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 catalyst bed. Nitrogen and oxygen were mixed before the reactor, m-Xylene was injected by a syringe pump into a heated nitrogen make-up gas stream of 300 cm3 rain-1. A microprocessor controlled temperature programmer ensured linear temperature ramps during heating and cooling. CO, CO2 and m-xylene were measured by a non-dispersive IR analyzer and by a photoionisation detector, respectively. The data were on-line collected by a computer. Experi- mental details have been reported elsewhere [7]. The experimental parameters were: heating and cooling rates 2-5 min-~, contact time 0.06 s, oxygen concentration 20-40 vol.-%, m-xylene concentration 0.06-0.3 vol.-%. The catalysts were tested in temperature programmed mode, but isothermal condi- tions were also applied for some experiments. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Low and high activity states First the performance of catalysts (I)-(III) working in low and high activity states that are characterized by transient regime in the conversion vs. tempera- ture curves, were compared. Here the differences in the transient states can be investigated which are indicative of the catalyst performance during activation. Furthermore, catalysts (I) and (II) have excellent heat conductance and mass transport properties, while sample (III) is a layered clay supported palladium on which the heat and mass transport could be a limiting factor. As we have considered all factors influencing the transient state in the earlier paper [8], the aim of the present study is the elucidation of the effect of catalyst morphology. The results for the three catalysts are summarized in Fig. la-c in which the low and high activity states are presented for all catalysts. All catalysts were initially in a low activity state during the first heating- cooling cycle because the ignition temperatures (defined as the temperature at which the conversion is 50% during heating) were rather high in the range between 380 and 420. In the low activity state CO2 formation between 200 and 300 both in the heating and cooling cycles shows a peculiar behaviour, namely, it has a small maximum. A smaller but definite maximum was observed also for CO as shown in Fig. lc. Since the temperature at which the CO an CO2 maxima are observed is low, it might be connected with partial deactivation of the catalyst. The appearance of CO is an indication of the temporary cease of total combustion which may be associated with temporary accumulation of m-xylene fragments. The low activity state which is characterized by the high ignition temperature, can be transformed into a high activity state. After 10-20 ramps up and down cycles or keeping the catalyst at 450 for longer time in the reaction mixture in the low activity state, a high activity state was developed with ignition tempera- L.

One of the important features is the disappearance of the small maximum in the CO2 concentration at low temperature. The high activity state was stable while the catalyst was in operation. When the catalyst was left in the reactor without running the reaction over two weeks, the catalysts was in the low activity state after recommencing the m-xylene combustion. The high activity state was recovered typically after 1-2 heating-cooling cycles. The catalysts working in high activity state, were tested under isotherm conditions. In Fig. 2 a typical curve is shown measured on (II) sample for the total combustion of m-xylene into carbon dioxide under the condition of 3000 ppm xylene, 20 vol.-% oxygen, flow rate 500 cm3 min-~, and at 260. For 8 h on stream the catalytic activity remains constant and only CO2 is formed. The same feature is valid for the other two catalyst samples as at full conversion all catalysts work evenly well. In order to clarify the origin of the maxima in CO2 and CO developed in the low activity state, a model experiment was performed which is presented in Fig. 3. The reaction was run at full conversion at 260, then the oxygen stream was shut down which was indicated by the complete stop of oxidation shown by the drop of the CO2 concentration to nil. After 2 min the oxygen stream was connected again, but full conversion was never reached and the COs rose to a value which corresponded only to 10% conversion and after a maximum it dropped to zero. The amount of CO2 formed during this period was 4.5-5 mol L.

It was assumed that during the oxygen deficient period part of the m-xylene was decomposed and carbonaceous deposits were formed. In order to prove it two experiments were carried out. First, the catalyst used in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3. was subjected to TPO in a separate instrument. In Fig. 4 (curve (a)) it is shown that in TPO CO2 is formed at a temperature of about 220 as a result of the removal of carbonaceous deposits produced from m-xylene which was accumulated during the light off period shown in Fig. 3. However, carbonaceous deposits are formed even after full conversion as shown in Fig. 4 (curve (b)). Here, the catalyst (II) in the high activity state was running at full conversion, then the catalyst was quenched and measured in the TPO experiment. Two maxima appeared, one at 220 and the other at 400. When the TPO experiment was carried out the second time (Fig. 4. curve (c)), only the high temperature peak was present indicating that part of the deposits was strongly bonded to the catalyst surface. This part may play a role in the oscillation at full conversion (see later). From the experiments the conclusion can be drawn that carbonaceous de- posits accumulated on the catalyst surface at a temperature of full conversion even in presence of oxygen. On this basis the obvious explanation for the 102 L.

Curve (a): oxygen consumption (upper curve) and CO2 formation (lower curve) from carbonaceous deposits accumulated under the light off period at 260; curve (b) CO2 formation after full conversion; curve (c) repeated TPO after curve (b). maxima in CO2 and CO in the low activity state demonstrated in Fig. 3c is that with increasing temperature, when the catalyst starts working, the m-xylene is combusted, but simultaneously a part of them interacts with the palladium surface which results in its deactivation, i.e. in the decrease of amount of CO2. Consequently, due to the retarded combustion, CO also appears in the gas phase. When the temperature is further increased the carbonaceous deposits resulting from the fragmentation of m-xylene are removed by oxygen and the CO2 conversion levels off at 100%. In the high activity state no maxima are observed, still carbonaceous deposits are formed bonded with different strengths to palladium surface. L. Bork6 et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 103 Hysteresis loops were also observed both in the low and high activity states. The positions of the ramps up and down half-cycles of the hysteresis loop as well as its width strongly depended on the experimental conditions as we already discussed and published [7,8]. Accordingly, the higher the heating rate and the oxygen concentration, the wider the hysteresis loop is. The similar behaviour of the catalysts in the combustion of m-xylene in the low and high activity states points to the absence of a heat and mass transfer effect. On samples (I) and (II) diffusion could be omitted as the linear gas velocity was 1-4 m s-1 and there was no pore structure present. On Pd/clinop- tilolite catalysts diffusion inside the catalyst can also be excluded as the palladium is mainly peripherally deposited on the outermost surface of the zeolite grains. The very characteristic differences between the low and high activity states is the change of the profile in the conversion vs. temperature curves. In the former case the total combustion is reached within a temperature range of about 120 from the starting temperature, whereas in high activity state after about 10% conversion the reaction was quickly accelerated (within a few degree of centigrade) and instantaneously reached the 100% conversion. We suggest the following explanations for the phenomena observed here. When the reaction starts in the as prepared state (low activity state), palladium is in the metallic form and hence, the catalyst must be 'trained' to develop a surface structure characteristic of the high activity state in the total conversion of m-xylene. In this state the combustion occurs in a typical heterogeneous oxidation, so the conversion increases with temperature in an exponential curve. Once the catalyst reaches the highly active state, after starting the heteroge- neous oxidation, the homogeneous reactions by chain propagation are initiated at about 200-300. This seems to be a rather low temperature, however, in the literature a chain initiation for combustion for aromatic compound is accepted [12]. For instance, the corresponding temperatures for chain initiation in ben- zene/Pd [13,14], toluene/Pt [15], styrene/Pt [16] are 220-400, 180, 240 which are in the range experienced in this paper. The question arises why it is specific only in the high activity state. One of the most plausible explanations is that the rates for the initiation and recombina- tion of the free radicals depends upon the state of the surface. The more reduced the surface (which may be the case in low activity state), the higher the rate for recombination is [17]. Once the surface is restructured and substantial amounts of PdO has been segregated to the outermost layer, that is, the catalyst is aged, PdOx is present as bulk compound (metallic palladium is not active in oxidation). Consequently, during evolution of the highly active state a slow oxidation occurs during which the particle size of palladium does not considerably change as in our catalysts there are large palladium particles already in the as prepared state. This is supported by X-ray diffraction which shows a particle size about 100 nm 104 L. Bork6 et al. // Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 g21 i /+/c,, -, 00j >/JV ....

XPS spectra ofPd 3d, O Is, C ls and Fermi edge on catalyst (II) measured in high activity state independently of the oxidation state. In this stage, due to the lack of metal sites, the reaction starts already in the low temperature regime, Simultaneously, formation of radicals is favoured and their recombination is disfavored. On storing the catalysts, the surface PdOx is slowly restructured. This is not a clarified process, most probably the metastable oxides decompose into stable PdO and a part of the surface becomes covered by metallic palladium. Sponta- neous decomposition of PdO occurs above 720 and does not take place at room temperature. XPS data appears to support this process. In Fig. 5 the Pd 3d, C 1 s, O 1 s and the Fermi edge are plotted measured on the active catalyst (II). The presence of PdO2 is indicated by the Pd 3d5/2 peak at 339 eV binding energy along with PdO at 336.7 eV. The O ls peak in an enveloping peak contains at least four components with binding energies of 530 eV, 531.4 eV, 533.1 eV and 534.6 eV. The last two species of oxygen are probably assigned to the species responsible for the high activity. The unusual high binding energies can also be explained by the presence of insulating particles on which the charging is higher than on the rest of the surface. At a low activity state these anomalous peaks disappear. Nevertheless, the transition between low and high activity state and vice versa, can be ascribed to -- beyond the change in the PdO/Pd ratio -- the change of the Pd-O binding energy. This explains the loss of activity and the regeneration of the high activity. As we mentioned an explanation operating with an increase of the crystallite size given in [1,2] does not apply in our case because the starting crystallite size is already large enough and one cannot assume a decrease in the crystallite size during storage.

Oscillation during m-xylene combustion The hysteresis in the concentration vs. temperature curve shows that combus- tion of m-xylene proceeds via multistage steady-state conditions. As the system is not stable under certain conditions the oxidation of m-xylene may show oscillations. Oscillation was observed only in the high activity state. Preliminary experiments showed that oscillation can be initialized by (i) step change in m-xylene concentration at low conversion, or (ii) by step change in the tempera- ture at full conversion. In Fig. 6. oscillation at full conversion is illustrated over Pd/clinoptilolite catalyst (III). Here the catalyst was heated by 10 rain-~ to 260 and then the temperature of the furnace was kept constant ( _+ 0.2) The CO2 conversion showed self sustained oscillation over a long period of time along with oscillation in the output temperature. The overshoots in CO2 concentration start sharp and decay much slower indicating an autocatalytic process. A basically similar periodic overshoot in CO2 concentration at full conversion is indicated in Fig. 7 for the Pd/stainless steel catalyst (II). At the maximum the CO, concentration is over the one calculated for full conversion. 106 L.

Bork6 et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 95-108 107 Using the same catalyst when the temperature is lower (220) than that required for the full conversion, no self-sustained but damped oscillation can be initialized by step change in m-xylene concentration as illustrated in Fig. 8. Here the initial large amplitude of the CO2 vs. time curve gradually decreases and levels off at steady state concentration. Oscillation in hydrocarbon oxidation is not well addressed [18]. Especially, the behaviour in full conversion is not fully understandable. However, the half amplitude of the wave is so high that it could not be ascribed to experimental error. The self-sustained oscillations developed as the surface initiated gas phase reaction, is disturbed by the change in the state of the surface and at the same time a part of the surface carbonaceous layer has been burnt off. The energy feed-back enhances oscillations. For the possible interpretation of the oscillatory behaviour the existence of surface deposits of the CxH~, and C~H,.Oz type has been proved in TPO experiments measured for catalyst (II). Oscillation in the partial conversion regime is likely caused by the changes in the composition of the surface layer when the rn-xylene concentration increases leading to excess heat formation, which in turn, gives rise to the overall temperature and the reaction rate increases. When the source for the excess heat is depleted (less deposit) the temperature is lowered and the rate decreases. After several over- and under- shoots, the system reaches a new stationary state. 4. Conclusions Transient experiments showed that regardless of the catalyst morphology low and high activity states exist in the total combustion of m-xylene over palladium containing catalysts. In the low activity state, small maxima both in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide exist due to accumulation of some carbonaceous fragments on the surface. On the other hand, in the high activity state no low temperature maxima are observed and the shape of the transient curves suggests a heterogeneously induced homogeneous chain propagation in the oxidation process. The transition between low and high activity states could not be attributed to the change in palladium particle size, but rather to the change in Pd/PdO ratio and to the formation of palladium oxides in a peculiar oxidation state as proven by XPS measurements. Hysteresis and oscillation appear in both states and only in the high activity state, respectively. In both cases the carbonaceous deposits proved by tempera- ture programmed oxidation, appear to be responsible for the phenomena ob- served. 108 L.

Low and high activity states in the carbon dioxide vs. inlet temperature transient curves in the catalytic combustion of m-xylenes over Pd2Ni50Nb48 amorphous alloy ribbons (I), Pd/stainless steel flakes (II) and Pd/clinoptilolite (III) samples have been investigated. In addition, in both states hysteresis, in high activity state self-sustained oscillation in the CO2 vs. time at full conversion and damped oscillation at low conversion were observed over samples (II) and (III). It was established that hysteresis is a general phenomenon in both states and is not affected by the catalyst structure, but it can be ascribed to Pd as active component. Transition between the low and high activity state may be due to change in the PdO structure as was indicated by XPS studies. Oscillation is indicative of the partial accumulation of carbonaceous deposits over the catalysts at full conversion, while damped oscillation might be a result of the change of local concentration due to overheating the catalyst sample during combustion.
