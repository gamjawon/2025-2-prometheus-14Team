Ni-based catalysts prepared using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma exhibit significantly enhanced coke resistance, leading to higher stability in catalytic reactions. The structural effect of the catalysts on the produced carbonaceous species required a thorough analysis. Herein, the low-temperature carbon deposition performance of a DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalyst (named Ni/SiO2-P) was studied through ethylene decomposition. It aimed to detect the surface carbonaceous species and investigate their evolvement mechanism. Extensive characterization demonstrated that more Ni active sites on Ni/SiO2-P improved ethylene decomposition with a higher yield of atomic carbon and highly reactive carbonaceous species, such as dissolved carbon and organic compounds. These species aggregated into onion-like carbon, CNFs, and CNTs, acting as deactivating carbonaceous species. Compared to a thermally calcined Ni catalyst, Ni/SiO2-P exhibited the lower formation of the deactivating carbonaceous species with smaller sizes and lower degrees of graphitization. The long-term tests for CO2 reforming of methane supported that the carbonaceous species on Ni/SiO2-P were more easily gasified with the absence of obvious deactivating carbonaceous species. The more stable Ni structure induced by the stronger Ni-support interaction provided an advantage in terms of hindering the growth of the deactivating carbonaceous species. This work thoroughly examined the enhanced coke resistance and catalytic stability of Ni/SiO2-P. It provides valuable insights into the development of DBD plasma-assisted catalyst synthesis for sustainable and efficient chemical reactions.

Exploring low-carbon energy sources and developing technologies for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions are imperative [1–3]. So far, CO/CO2 hydrogenation and CO2/steam reforming of methane have been intensively studied and widely applied, and have important research significance for renewable energy [4–7]. Due to the high activity, low cost, and plentiful resources of nickel (Ni), Ni-based catalysts have been extensively applied for the catalytic reactions [8–10]. However, lots of them are subjected rapid deactivation due to carbon deposition, which needs an urgent solution [11–13]. The conversion of methane, CO, or CO2 usually begins with the dissociation of methane or CO on the Ni surface. Although the formed atomic carbon can be gasified in the presence of H2O, CO2, or H2, a portion of it tends to aggregate into graphitized carbon, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation and reaction termination [14–16]. Many endeavors have been made to enhance the coke resistance of the Ni-based catalysts, closely related to optimizing the structural and surface properties [17–19]. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, a critical technology for material modification, has been widely employed in synthesizing Ni-based catalysts for CO/CO2 hydrogenation and CO2/steam reforming of methane [20,21]. The structural advantages, such as reducing the size of Ni nanoparticles (NPs), enhancing metal-support interaction (SMSI), and improving oxygen storage capacity, derived from the high-energy electron bombardment and low-temperature effect of DBD plasma, have notably improved the coke resistance [22–24]. The structural effect of the catalysts on the structural morphologies of the carbonaceous species formed during the reactions has been studied [14,15]. However, there is a lack of in-depth research on the formation and evolution mechanisms of the carbonaceous species, which means that the fundamental reason for the enhanced coke resistance of the DBD plasma treated Ni-based catalysts still needs to be explored. Atomic carbon, formed from the dissociation and adsorption of methane or CO on Ni-based catalysts, is considered the initial intermediate in the conversion of methane, CO, or CO2 into gaseous products. It tends to aggregate into carbonaceous species with different chemical properties and structural morphologies. Analyzing the structural effect of DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalysts on the reactivity of atomic carbon and its evolution into different carbonaceous species is crucial for exploring the fundamental reason behind enhanced coke resistance [14–16,20]. Unfortunately, detecting and capturing atomic carbon and other highly reactive carbonaceous species has been proven to be challenging, due to their high instability at the high reaction temperatures. Ethylene, the simplest unsaturated hydrocarbon, is more easily decomposed at lower temperatures compared to methane and CO [25,26]. Therefore, we used ethylene as a model for analyzing the low-temperature carbon deposition performance of a DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalyst during ethylene decomposition. This allowed us to detect atomic carbon and other highly reactive carbonaceous species. For comparison, another catalyst sample prepared using thermal calcination was employed. TG/DSC, XRD, TEM, XPS, operando DRIFT, and Raman techniques were employed to study the structural effect of the Ni catalysts on the properties of various types of carbonaceous species evolved from atomic carbon. The derived evolution mechanism of the surface carbonaceous species was employed to explain the significantly enhanced coke resistance of Ni-based catalysts through DBD plasma treatment. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Two kinds of Ni-based catalysts were synthesized using SiO2 (Sigma, SBET = 350–430 m2 g–1) as the support. The loading amount of Ni was 10 wt%. SiO2 powder was incipiently impregnated with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O. The solution was aged at ambient temperature for 12 h. The resulting Ni(NO3)2·xH2O/SiO2 precursor was dried at 110 °C for 12 h, followed by decomposition using DBD plasma for 1 h. The DBD plasma set-up employed was described in the previous study [27]. Argon was employed as the plasma forming gas. 0.5 g of the sample was placed in the plasma reactor for the decomposition process. Finally, a metallic Ni catalyst sample, termed Ni/SiO2-P, was obtained from the SiO2-supported NiO catalyst (termed NiO/SiO2-P) reduced by H2 in a flow rate of 20 mL min–1 at 550 °C for 1 h. For comparison, the other half of the Ni(NO3)2·xH2O/SiO2 precursor was treated by thermal calcination under static air at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the NiO/SiO2-C sample. The reduced Ni/SiO2-C catalyst was synthesized via H2-reduction treatment at 550 °C on NiO/SiO2-C. 2.2 Ethylene decomposition reaction Ethylene decomposition on the two Ni/SiO2 catalysts was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. The quartz tubular reactor, loaded with 50 mg of the catalyst sample, was fed with H2 at a flow rate of 20 mL min–1 and maintained at 550 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the ethylene decomposition reactions were carried out at temperatures of 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 °C, respectively, under a 5.0% C2H4/Ar mixed gas (20 mL min–1) for 20 min. Following the reactions, the gas mixture was switched to an Ar gas flow, and the reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature. The used catalyst samples were then collected. 2.3 Characterizations Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for the used Ni catalyst samples after ethylene decomposition were measured using a Netzsch STA 449 F3 system. The oxidation processes were carried out within the temperature range of 35–800 °C under an air flow of 80 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were conducted using a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with a Ni-filtered Cu target and Kα ray irradiation (40 kV and 200 mA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a Philips Tecnai G2 F20 system. Oxygen temperature programmed oxidation-mass spectrometry (O2-TPO-MS) was conducted with a TPDRO apparatus (TP-5080, Tianjin Xianquan Co., Ltd). Before O2-TPO-MS, 50 mg of the used samples were purged through an Ar gas flow (30 mL min–1) at 50 °C for 2 h. Then, the oxidation processes were conducted in a 5% O2/Ar (30 mL min–1) with the temperature increasing to 800 °C at a 10 °C min–1 ramp rate. The effluent gases were analyzed on a mass spectrometry detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded in a Thermo ESCALAB 250 XI spectrometer operated at 12.5 kV and 16 mA with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The measured binding energies were calibrated using the C1s peak (284.6 eV) as a reference. Raman spectra were obtained using a DXR Microscope instrument using a 532 nm wavelength laser for excitation. Operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded in a Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker). Following H2-reduction at 550 °C for 1 h, the samples underwent purging in Ar (20 mL min–1) for another 1 h. Then, ethylene adsorption experiments were conducted under a 5.0% C2H4/Ar gas mixture (20 mL min–1) within the temperature range of 50–300 °C. 3 Results 3.1 Types of carbonaceous species formed on Ni-based catalysts in ethylene decomposition TG and DSC analyses in an air atmosphere for the used catalysts after ethylene decomposition at different temperatures were conducted to identify various types of growing carbonaceous species. TG curves are shown in Fig. 1a. The increase and decrease in the mass of the catalysts are due to the oxidation of metallic Ni and carbonaceous species, respectively [14]. Before reaching 200 °C, there is hardly any noticeable mass change. A slight increase in weight is observed around 300 °C and 370 °C for Ni/SiO2-P and Ni/SiO2-C, respectively, attributed to the oxidation of metallic Ni. Subsequently, weight losses occur for both catalysts due to the oxidation of the carbonaceous species. These weight losses were used to compute the yields of the carbonaceous species, referred to as carbon yields, resulting from ethylene decomposition, as shown in Fig. 1c. The rise of the decomposition temperature leads to a continuous increase in the ethylene decomposition rate, as evidenced by the gradual increase in the carbon yield. At 200 °C, Ni/SiO2-P exhibits a carbon yield of 2.5%, whereas Ni/SiO2-C has that lower than 1.0%. Furthermore, Ni/SiO2-P consistently exhibits higher carbon yields compared to Ni/SiO2-C, suggesting that the DBD plasma treatment significantly enhances the ethylene decomposition with an increased production of carbonaceous species. As shown in Fig. 1b, the exothermic peaks in the DSC curves represent the enthalpy changes associated with the oxidation of the carbonaceous species. To discern the various types of the carbonaceous species existing on the two catalysts, the overlapping peaks in the DSC curves were meticulously fitted using a Gaussian-type function, as illustrated in Fig. S1. It is evident that the carbonaceous species formed at higher decomposition temperatures are harder to be oxidized. After ethylene decomposition at 200 °C, Ni/SiO2-P displays the exothermic peaks at 227 °C, 261 °C, and 304 °C, whereas Ni/SiO2-C exhibits the peaks at higher temperatures of 292 °C and 358 °C. At 250 °C, Ni/SiO2-P exhibits no peak around 227 °C; instead, the other two peaks shift to 270 °C and 315 °C. As for Ni/SiO2-C, the two peaks shift to 291 °C and 336 °C, and an additional peak appears at a higher temperature of 367 °C. The carbonaceous species with oxidation temperatures below and above 300 °C are referred to as α-carbon (Cα) and β-carbon (Cβ), respectively [14–16]. The proportion of α-carbon (denoted as rα-carbon) was calculated using the following formula: rα-carbon (%) = 100% × Sα-carbon/Stotal, where Sα-carbon and Stotal represent the peak areas below 300 °C and the total peak area, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the proportion of α-carbon decreases for both catalysts as the decomposition temperature increases. Ni/SiO2-P exhibits a higher concentration of the Cα species at all temperatures except at 300 °C. Although Ni/SiO2-C exhibits a higher rα-carbon at 300 °C, it requires higher oxidation temperature. At 350 °C, two new peaks emerge at 418 °C and 529 °C for Ni/SiO2-P, corresponding to the carbonaceous species denoted as γ-carbon (Cγ) and γ'-carbon (Cγ'), respectively [28–30]. The high-temperature carbonaceous species on Ni/SiO2-C require higher oxidation temperatures than Ni/SiO2-P, and they constitute significantly greater proportions. Additionally, the Cα species disappear on Ni/SiO2-C above 350 °C, but remain visible on Ni/SiO2-P even at 450 °C. The results indicate that the DBD plasma promotes the formation and stability of the Cα species, thus suppressing their subsequent transformation into higher-temperature carbonaceous species. Carbonaceous species with higher degrees of graphitization exhibit greater resistance to oxidation, necessitating higher temperatures for their removal. By combining the findings from TG/DSC in this study with those reported in the literature, it is proposed that the evolution of the carbonaceous species formed on the catalyst follows the order: Cα → Cβ → Cγ → Cγ' [14–16,28–30]. As the most active form of Cα, atomic carbon is obtained from direct ethylene dissociation, and typically undergoes oxidation at temperatures around 100 °C. A portion of the atomic carbon rapidly diffuses into the Ni lattice, resulting in the formation of dissolved carbon [26]. This process may even induce structural rearrangements within the Ni phase, leading to the creation of bulk nickel carbide (Ni3C). The remaining portion tends to convert into organic compounds through continuous diffusion, hydrogenation, and polymerization [31,32]. The atomic carbon, dissolved carbon, Ni3C, and organic carbon collectively fall under the category of Cα. They typically exhibit oxidation temperatures below 300 °C, and often play pivotal roles in catalytic reactions without inducing catalyst deactivation. Cβ species, involving polymerized and amorphous carbon with disordered structures, usually act as intermediates of graphitized carbon growing from Cα deposition [4,33]. Graphitized carbon, denoted as Cγ or Cγ', is more stably deposited with various structures and morphologies [15,16,28–30]. Importantly, it tends to completely encapsulate or destroy metallic Ni and interfacial active sites, which is a primary cause of catalyst deactivation. The DBD plasma treatment effectively promotes ethylene decomposition at a higher rate compared to the conventional thermal calcination, resulting in a greater yield of the Cα species. Furthermore, the Cα species display higher stability along with less graphitized carbon production, as a critical factor in augmenting resistance to carbon deposition. 3.2 Structure and morphology of carbonaceous species formed on Ni-based catalysts O2-TPO-MS analyses were conducted on the used catalysts to further detect atomic carbon. As shown in Fig. 2, both used catalysts exhibit a small CO2 peak, primarily attributed to atomic carbon, within the 100–200 °C range after ethylene decomposition at 200 °C [14–16]. Indeed, Ni/SiO2-P shows a larger peak than Ni/SiO2-C, suggesting more atomic carbon present on Ni/SiO2-P. The peak disappears as the decomposition temperature rises to 300 °C, implying the challenge of maintaining the stable presence of atomic carbon. The other peaks observed are consistent with those in the DSC curves, verifying the accuracy of the DSC measurement in distinguishing the different types of the carbonaceous species. XRD analyses were conducted for temperature-programmed ethylene decomposition over the two catalysts, to determine the formation and evolution of metallic carbide and graphitized carbon. As shown in Fig. 3, the broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 22° is assigned to SiO2. Below 350 °C, no obvious peak at 2θ = 26.4° can be observed for both catalysts, corresponding to the (002) lattice plane of graphite carbon. Above 350 °C, the graphitized carbon peak begins to appear for Ni/SiO2-C, and exhibits increasing intensity with rising temperature. In contrast, Ni/SiO2-P shows a weaker peak at 2θ = 26.4°, indicating a lower crystallinity degree of the graphitized carbon. The XRD pattern of the reduced Ni/SiO2-C exhibits two strong characteristic peaks of metallic fcc-Ni at 2θ around 44.6° and 52.0°, corresponding to the (111) and (200) lattice planes, respectively. In contrast, the metallic Ni peaks for the reduced Ni/SiO2-P are broader and less intense, indicating that the Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-P possess smaller sizes and better dispersion compared to those on Ni/SiO2-C. Calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the Ni(111) diffraction peak, the average size of the Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-P is approximately 5.6 nm, much smaller than that of Ni/SiO2-C (15.8 nm). This suggests that the DBD plasma treatment imparts higher dispersion and smaller sizes to the Ni NPs [20]. It is worth noting that the metallic Ni peaks shift to lower diffraction angles, i.e., 43.2° and 50.7°, for the catalyst samples exposed to ethylene at 200 °C. These shifts are most likely due to the atomic carbon dissolving into the Ni lattice, leading to its expansion [26,34]. Throughout the experiment from 200 °C to 300 °C, Ni on Ni/SiO2-P remains in a metallic state with the formation of dissolved carbon, referred to as NiCx. Above 350 °C, the surface diffusion and aggregation of the carbon atoms lead to the formation of graphitized carbon, accompanied by the recovery of the metallic Ni phase with the peaks back to 44.6° and 52.0°. In comparison, on Ni/SiO2-C, a hexagonal close-packed Ni3C phase with the peaks at 2θ = 39.5°, 41.9°, 44.9°, and 58.6° is formed from 250 °C, as a result of the rearrangement of the fcc-Ni phase with the dissolved carbon [34,35]. Above 350 °C, more graphitized carbon grows with the peaks of Ni3C becoming weaker. This suggests that the Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-P, with higher dispersion, exhibit better stability than those on Ni/SiO2-C, and their phase transformation to bulk Ni3C can be effectively limited. TEM analyses were used to directly observe the morphologies of the carbonaceous species. The Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-P exhibit a more uniform distribution with a smaller average size of about 5.4 nm, compared to those on Ni/SiO2-C with an average size of about 14.4 nm (Fig. S2). At 200 °C, solid-phase carbon is invisible for both catalysts. At 300 °C, a small amount of amorphous carbon grows nearby the Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-P, whereas more carbon encapsulates the Ni NPs on Ni/SiO2-C (Fig. S3). In Fig. 4, it is evident that onion-like carbon is formed over Ni/SiO2-P with almost completely disordered carbon layers at 400 °C. In contrast, fibrous carbon is initially observed on Ni/SiO2-C. At 450 °C, a few carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with diameters ranging from 10 to 20 nm are visible on the edges of Ni/SiO2-P. In comparison, numerous CNFs and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with an average diameter of ∼50 nm appear around Ni/SiO2-C. The Ni NPs are either located inside the channel or at the tips of the CNTs and CNFs, supporting that the growth of the CNTs and CNFs follows the tip-growth mechanism, in which the carbon atoms precipitate out and crystallize as the CNTs and CNFs with the Ni NPs being pushed off the support [26]. In combination with the TG/DSC results, it is proposed that onion-like carbon in a lower graphitization degree should be classified as Cγ. The CNFs and CNTs, denoted as Cγ', exhibit significantly larger dimensions and higher levels of graphitization. In comparison to Ni/SiO2-C, Ni/SiO2-P exhibits a much lower formation of Cγ and Cγ'. 3.3 Evolution of carbonaceous species on Ni-based catalysts XPS analyses were conducted to explore the formation and transformation of the carbonaceous species. In the Ni2p3/2 spectra in Fig. 5a and b, the peaks at 856.4 eV are attributed to Ni(OH)2, along with the satellite region extending beyond 858.0 eV [8–10]. The peaks corresponding to NiCx at 853.3 eV are visible at 200 °C, implying that the surface Ni is in a NiCx state with carbon atoms dissolving into the metallic Ni lattice [34,36]. The NiCx phase increases at 300 °C, and disappears at 400 °C accompanied by the appearance of Ni3C at 853.8 eV. This implies the initial formation of NiCx which subsequently transforms into Ni3C at higher temperatures. Additionally, the peak at 852.1 eV for the metallic Ni phase is only visible for Ni/SiO2-P, indicating that the metallic Ni phase on Ni/SiO2-C is less stable and more likely to undergo a phase transformation to Ni3C. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the peaks in the XPS spectra of C1s represent various forms of the carbonaceous species. The peak at 288.5 eV corresponds to CO bond, while the peaks at 284.6 and 285.8 eV are associated with CC and C-C bond, respectively [37,38]. These chemical bonds likely originate from organic compounds generated during ethylene decomposition. Almost no trace of NiCx can be found, possibly due to its much lower concentration compared to the organic compounds. At 400 °C, Ni3C with the peak at 283.6 eV is discernible for both samples. Operando DRIFT was conducted during temperature-programmed ethylene adsorption on both samples. The evolution of the organic compounds can be identified in the DRIFT spectra in the 50–350 °C temperature range [39,40]. In Fig. 6a, aliphatic hydrocarbons (2963, 2931, 2874, and 1420 cm–1), aromatic hydrocarbons (3020, 1568, 1516, and 1460 cm–1), and carboxylic acids (1700 and 3300 cm–1) can be observed on Ni/SiO2-P at 50 °C. Besides, the bands at 3132, 3070, and 951 cm–1 are assigned to ethylene. The concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons gradually increase with rising the decomposition temperature, while carboxylic acids decrease along with the emergence of aromatic ethers (1284 and 1122 cm–1). This suggests that aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic ethers are produced through the polycondensation and aromatization of aliphatic hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids as the temperature increased. The presence of oxygen in carboxylic acids and aromatic ethers likely originates from the oxygen-containing groups on the catalyst surface, such as hydroxyl and adsorbed oxygen. Although the evolution of the organic compounds on Ni/SiO2-C is similar to that on Ni/SiO2-P, their yields are significantly lower (Fig. 6b). Consequently, the DBD plasma treatment promotes the formation of the organic compounds, which can actively participate in the catalytic reactions. Raman spectra depicting the carbonaceous species on the two catalysts are presented in Fig. 6c and d. The G band at 1580 cm–1 and the D band at 1350 cm–1 arise from the in-plane carbon-carbon stretching vibrations of graphite layers and the structural imperfection of graphite, respectively [41,42]. The relative intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) is employed for a qualitative assessment of graphitic crystalline order. As illuminated in Table S1, Ni/SiO2-P exhibits higher ID/IG values than Ni/SiO2-C, due to the lower degree of graphitization in the deposited carbon. 4 Discussion Previous research has demonstrated the enhanced coke resistance of the DBD plasma treated Ni-based catalysts in the reactions, such as CO hydrogenation and CO2/steam reforming of methane [14–16,20–24]. Studies have focused on the structural effect of the catalysts on the structural morphologies of deactivating carbonaceous species. However, detecting atomic carbon and other highly reactive carbonaceous species is difficult, due to their high instability at high reaction temperatures. The lack of in-depth research on the formation and evolution of these various carbonaceous species has hindered the exploration of the fundamental reason for the enhanced coke resistance of DBD plasma treated Ni-based catalysts. In this work, ethylene was employed as a model for the analysis of the low-temperature carbon deposition performance of the DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalyst during ethylene decomposition, to figure out the formation and evolution mechanisms of the carbonaceous species. For a comprehensive understanding of the enhanced coke resistance of the DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalyst, a long-term test for CO2 reforming of methane at 700 °C was conducted, as shown in Fig. S4a. Ni/SiO2-P maintained excellent stability for both CH4 and CO2 conversion within the 24 h of operation, while Ni/SiO2-C experienced a decline in activity over time, ultimately leading to the blockage of the reaction tube after approximately 10 h. TG/DSC and TEM were employed to observe the coke formation. In Fig. S4b, a much less weight loss is presented for Ni/SiO2-P compared to Ni/SiO2-C, indicating lower coke formation. An obvious DSC peak at 571 °C for Ni/SiO2-C implies serious carbon accumulation, a main factor in deactivation. In Fig. S4, the TEM image of the used Ni/SiO2-C presents numerous CNFs and CNTs with Ni NPs located either inside the channel or at the tips. These carbonaceous species were also been observed on the thermally calcined Ni catalysts reported in previous research [15,16,20]. They were identified as the cause of catalyst deactivation, due to the destruction of interfacial active sites and severe pore blockage. In contrast, for Ni/SiO2-P, no obvious filamentous carbon or encapsulating carbon can be observed, indicating that the deactivating carbonaceous species can be greatly suppressed. Fig. 7 presents the growth of the carbonaceous species on Ni/SiO2-P and Ni/SiO2-C during ethylene decomposition. Atomic carbon, dissolved carbon, metallic carbide, and organic compounds usually act as key intermediates reacting with reactive gas (such as CO2, H2O, or H2). In the absence of reactive gas, these Cα species have a tendency to aggregate into graphitized carbon. The Cγ graphitized carbon, i.e., onion-like carbon, tends to encapsulate the Ni NPs. And CNFs and CNTs with the Ni NPs inside the channel or at the tips, as the Cγ’ species, can encapsulate the Ni NPs and destroy the Ni-support interface. The resulting catalyst deactivation is primarily due to the poisoning of the active sites or/and pore blockage, which is very harmful to all catalytic reactions. The deactivating carbonaceous species are observable on Ni/SiO2-P above 350 °C, whereas they become evident on Ni/SiO2-C at a lower temperature of 300 °C. Less metallic carbides in both bulk and surface regions of Ni/SiO2-P are observed, owing to the enhanced SMSI effect as previously demonstrated [21–23]. Ni/SiO2-P with a more stable Ni structure is unfavorable for the growth of the CNFs and CNTs using metallic carbides as intermediates [43,44]. This is crucial for maintaining the catalytic stability in the CO2 reforming of methane process. Therefore, the DBD plasma treated Ni-based catalysts promotes the formation of the highly reactive carbonaceous species with increased yield and stability, leading to higher catalytic activity and stability in the reactions. 5 Conclusions This study performed low-temperature ethylene decomposition over two Ni-based catalysts treated using DBD plasma and thermal calcination, to detect the surface carbonaceous species and investigate the structural effect of the catalysts on their formation and evolution. The results of TG/DSC, O2-TPO-MS, XRD, TEM, XPS, Raman, and operando DRIFT confirmed that Ni/SiO2-P facilitated ethylene decomposition with a higher yield of atomic carbon, attributed to more Ni active sites provided by the Ni-support interface with better Ni dispersion. The atomic carbon was rapidly transformed into dissolved carbon, metallic carbide, and organic compounds. In the absence of reactive gas, these highly reactive carbonaceous species gradually aggregated into the deactivating carbonaceous species (i.e., onion-like carbon, CNFs, and CNTs). Compared to Ni/SiO2-C, Ni/SiO2-P exhibited a much lower formation of the deactivating carbonaceous species with smaller sizes and lower degrees of graphitization. Based on the long-term tests for CO2 reforming of methane, and corresponding TG/DSC and TEM results, it was found that the highly reactive carbonaceous species on Ni/SiO2-P were easier to be gasified by CO2, and the more stable Ni structure was unfavorable for the growth of the deactivating carbonaceous species. The collaboration between low-temperature ethylene decomposition and long-term tests for CO2 reforming of methane confirmed that the DBD plasma promoted the formation of highly reactive carbonaceous species with increased yield and stability. This led to higher catalytic activity and stability in the reactions. This study discussed the relationship between the Ni structure and the carbonaceous species formed during low-temperature ethylene decomposition and CO2 reforming of methane, to provide an in-depth understanding of the DBD plasma-treated Ni catalysts with significantly improved coke resistance.

        "dc:description": "Ni-based catalysts prepared using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma exhibit significantly enhanced coke resistance, leading to higher stability in catalytic reactions. The structural effect of the catalysts on the produced carbonaceous species required a thorough analysis. Herein, the low-temperature carbon deposition performance of a DBD plasma-treated Ni-based catalyst (named Ni/SiO2-P) was studied through ethylene decomposition. It aimed to detect the surface carbonaceous species and investigate their evolvement mechanism. Extensive characterization demonstrated that more Ni active sites on Ni/SiO2-P improved ethylene decomposition with a higher yield of atomic carbon and highly reactive carbonaceous species, such as dissolved carbon and organic compounds. These species aggregated into onion-like carbon, CNFs, and CNTs, acting as deactivating carbonaceous species. Compared to a thermally calcined Ni catalyst, Ni/SiO2-P exhibited the lower formation of the deactivating carbonaceous species with smaller sizes and lower degrees of graphitization. The long-term tests for CO2 reforming of methane supported that the carbonaceous species on Ni/SiO2-P were more easily gasified with the absence of obvious deactivating carbonaceous species. The more stable Ni structure induced by the stronger Ni-support interaction provided an advantage in terms of hindering the growth of the deactivating carbonaceous species. This work thoroughly examined the enhanced coke resistance and catalytic stability of Ni/SiO2-P. It provides valuable insights into the development of DBD plasma-assisted catalyst synthesis for sustainable and efficient chemical reactions.",
