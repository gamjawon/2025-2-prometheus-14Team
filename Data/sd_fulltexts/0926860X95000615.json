II. Reduction properties in relation to catalytic properties Jiyan Zhang *, Yanji Wang, Liu Chang Department of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, 300072 Tianjin, People's Republic of China Received 12 September 1994; revised 18 February 1995; accepted 24 February 1995 Abstract This paper deals with the reduction properties of methanol synthesis sulfide catalysts containing different promotors and supports. It is characterized by the reactivity of the sulfur containing species present in the catalyst with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulfide which is detected by FPD. In connection with the TPR pattern and the activity and selectivity evaluation data of different catalysts, it can be seen that there is truly a new phase formed responsible for methanol synthesis when potassium carbonate has been incorporated into molybdenum disulfide and the support is not merely a simple carrier, but also a modifier of the catalyst to modulate its relative activity and selectivity for getting the highest methanol yield.

Introduction Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is a very useful technique in studying the effects of promotors and supports on the primary catalyst, particularly for those catalysts used in a reducing atmosphere. Much work has been done on the oxides of either the catalysts themselves or their precursors, yet very little on sulfides directly, especially as regards carbon monoxide hydrogenation catalysts. In the previous paper [ 1 ] , Part I of this series, it has been shown that by adding different promotors and supports to the primary molybdenum disulfide catalyst, its activity * Corresponding author.

Such a great change must be due to the presence of a new active phase other than that originally existing in the primary catalyst and its existence should be displayed in the TPR pattern. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts (see ref. (1 J) Molybdenum disulfide MOSZ(com) was obtained from a commercial source, while MOS2(exp) was prepared in the laboratory. Alkali or alkaline earth carbonate promoted molybdenum disulfide MOS2/K2C03, MOSz/NaZCO3 and MOS2/CaC03 were prepared in the laboratory. Supported molybdenum disulfide catalyst MOS2/KZC03/MgO-Si02 and MOS2/KZC03/Li20-y-A1203 were all prepared in the laboratory. 2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) The flow sheet is shown in Fig. 1. Flame photospectroscopic detection (FPD ) was used to measure the sulfur content in the effluent gas. The catalyst was placed in a U type quartz reactor under nitrogen atmosphere. The system was purged with high purity nitrogen for 1 h and under nitrogen stream it was temperature-programmed up to 673 K to clean the catalyst surface. After cooling down to room temperature, the system was switched to a hydrogen-nitrogen stream for the temperature-programmed reduction experiment. Experimental conditions: sample weight 2-6 mg; heating rate 10 K/min; temperature range 293-1123 K; hydrogen flow-rate 5.8 - 10-6 mol/s; hydrogen content in hydrogen-nitrogen mixture 28%. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. TPR of molybdenum disulfide Fig. 2 gives the TPR pattern of MOS2(exp) and MOS2(com). MOS2(com) has only one single peak IV at a temperature of 1023 K. After holding it at that temperature for 35 min, its reduction rate begins to fall, then the experiment was J.

It is a welldefined crystal. The peak shape is good. As compared with MoS2(com), MOS2(exp) has two more peaks I and II. They overlap and have comparatively low reduction temperatures. This indicates that MOS2(exp) is a mixture of three different sulfur containing species. One of which is crystalline molybdenum disulfide, it has the same peak temperature as MOS2(com). The other two species should be determined. 3.2. Effect of alkali carbonates on MOS2(exp) When the same amount of alkali carbonates (20 wt.-% of the catalyst) is added into MOS2(exp) and prepared by the same procedure as reported in part I of this series, the resultant catalysts give different TPR patterns as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. MOSz/CaC03 shows almost no difference from the single MOS2(exp). MOS2/ K2C03 and MOS2/Na2CO3 give a new peak III in between peaks I+II and peak IV, accompanied by some shape change of peaks I and II, while the temperature of peak IV remains unchanged. The occurrence of peak III demonstrates a new phase formed in the catalyst by the action of alkali carbonate on molybdenum disulfide as has been proposed in part I, deduced from the formation of alcohols. Now it can be said that peak III is responsible for alcohol formation. This conclusion can be confirmed in another way, that is MOS2/CaC03 gives no peak III and no alcohol. J.

TPR pattern of MoSZ/KzC03 catalyst with different potassium content. From Figs. 3, 4 and Table 1, it can be seen that of these peak III areas, potassium carbonate gives the largest one and accordingly more alcohols. So potassium carbonate is considered to be the best promotor and hence our work will focus on it. Accidentally, potassium is usually taken as the first choice promotor in many solid catalysts, yet in quantities far less than that in the present one. The new phase obtained here is a composite sulfide of molybdenum and potassium, and can be designated as Mo-S-K or MoS2 ~ xKZS (x < 1) .

Effect of potassium carbonate content on molybdenum disulfide Fig. 4 and Table 2 show the changes in the TPR pattern with various amounts of potassium carbonate. Higher potassium carbonate content moves the temperature of peak III to higher values and gives a larger peak area. It means that when more potassium carbonate is added, more of the new Mo-S-K phase will be formed and with higher crystallinity. At low potassium carbonate content, peak III is very diffuse and much more easily reducible at lower temperature. For a still high potassium content, peak III becomes very sharp with a high reduction peak temperature because of high crystallinity. The MOS2/20%K2C03 catalyst does not give a too high peak III temperature, exhibiting a relatively high reactivity with hydrogen. Yet, it still has a rather large peak III area and a pretty good methanol yield. Thus, 20% K2C03-MOS2 is taken as the final catalyst. When peak III increases, peaks I + II nearly from two separate peaks, gradually contracting to almost a single one with peak II as a shoulder on peak I. In this case, peak 11, the sulfur containing species is assumed to be a pseudostable phase and can be transformed into peak III by reaction with more potassium carbonate. 3.4. Influence of support on MoS2/KZC03 Fig. 5 and Table 3 show the influences of different supports on the TPR pattern of MOS2/K2C03. All of them have almost the same peak I temperature, although with different heights. The temperature of peak III changes somewhat, yet not much. The temperature of peak II varies greatly. Such a variation depends entirely on the nature of the supports and the complex interaction between support and MOS2/K2C03. The most apparent effect is the action of the support on peak I and II leading them to separate into two individual peaks, as well as the redistribution of the amount of sulfur-containing species between the compounds corresponding to peak I, II, III and IV. Magnesium oxide decreases the amount of the species corresponding to peak 1, and increases those corresponding to peak 11 and III. Peak I and 11 are responsible J.

Peak III is responsible for methanol selectivity, and the larger this peak is, the better is the selectivity. However, magnesium oxide alone does not result in getting the greatest methanol yield. Silica makes peak I the largest, and peak lI and III the smallest, but peak III is somewhat larger than peak II.

Zhang et al. /Applied Catahsis A: General 126 (1995) 1,219-1,227 synthesis or a proper combination of magnesium oxide and silica may give a better distribution between peaks 1, 11 and 111, since Mg0-Si02 itself is a good support commonly used in hydrogenation. Actually, when magnesium oxide is 40-60 mol% in the Mg0-SiOz mixture, the methanol yield is higher. The reason may be the synergetic action of their acidity and basicity on MOS2/20%KZC03. The acidity of the composite support Mg0-Si02 changes greatly from high to low, when more magnesium oxide is added into silica. In the case of lithium modified y-alumina, it has the same trend of changing acidity with addition of lithium oxide into y-alumina as in the M90-SiOz system, but it does not affect the activity and selectivity of MOS2-KZCOg much as Mg0S102 does. This is because the acidity of L0-y-A1203 is too high to be affected by the main catalyst MOS2/KZC03, which is weakly basic. The MOS2/KZC03/ U20-y-A1203 catalyst almost gives the same peak temperature and same peak area of I, II and III with different quantity of lithium oxide in y-alumina. M90-S'02 support exerts a so strong action on the main catalyst, that there is a suitable percentage of it in silica to give the highest yield of methanol. 4. Conclusions 4.1. Classification of sulfur containing species Peak IV species is a well-crystallized molybdenum disulfide which has been identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and can only be reduced at high temperature by hydrogen but not to complection under the present experimenal conditions. Peak I is supposed to be a chemisorbed ad-sulfur species SX which cannot be swept away in a helium stream. TPR calculation of peak I gives the ratio of sulfur to molybdenum S/Mo > 2. The size of it is increased and strongly affected by the sulfur content in feed gas. It is also influenced by different carbonates and supports. Its existence has also been observed by Ramachandran and Massoth [ 2] and Burch and Collins [3] on the surface of sulfided molybdenum on alumina. Its reduction temperature (523 K) is very close to the reaction temperature (523 K). It affords the active center for carbon monoxide hydrogenation and for hydrocarbon formation, but not for alcohols. Peak III is the one uniquely responsible for methanol formation, i.e. without peak III, no methanol is formed. It is the product produced by the action of carbonates, especially potassium carbonate on molybdenum disulfide. It can be designated MoS-K or MOSz - xK2S (x < 1) , a composite sulfide of molybdenum and potassium. The molybdenum/ potassium ratio of it has not been indentified by XRD, but if more potassium carbonate is added, more Mo-S-K will be formed, and a higher methanol selectivity will result. Peak Il always appears together with peak I and highly resembles it in taking part in furnishing sites responsible for carbon monoxide hydrogenation. The posi- J. Zhang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 126 (1995) L219-L227 L227 tion and the form of it vary with different promotors and supports. It may be a separate peak, a shoulder of peak I or overlapping with peak 1. It is suggested to be a nonstoichiometric or amorphous molybdenum sulfide, yet this has not been found in the XRD pattern. It is quite reactive, for example, it reacts with alkali carbonate to form peak III. Under the influence of the support it separates from peak I. In most cases, as in methanol synthesis it extracts the sulfur containing species from peak I to remain itself unchanged and making peak III of proper size for high methanol yield. 4.2. TPR as a technique for characterization of methanol sulfide catalyst TPR is a very useful tool for elucidating some minute details of many solid catalysts with redox behaviour, such as metals, their oxides and sulfides. Directly measuring the hydrogen sulfide content in the effluent gas during hydrogen reduction of a sulfide catalyst is particularly valuable to get information from the hydrogenation process, such as carbon monoxide hydrogenation, which is an industrially important reaction for a multitude of products. The two main product series, hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing compounds, can be clearly shown by TPR and can be adjusted by catalyst formulation, preparation and performance afterwards. In the present case a high yield of methanol is naturally expected. During exploring and developing a suitable catalyst for that purporse, the TPR pattern is a very useful guide to modulate the kind and the amount of promotors and supports introduced, etc. An interesting example as shown in this paper is that potassium carbonate lets the molybdenum sulfide TPR peaks I and II approach one another, while the support lets them separate into individual peaks. Such a large change and sharp contrast must be due to some transformation and reconstruction of the sulfurcontaining species, which can be easily seen from TPR. Based on the TPR diagram and by tracing the changes of specific peaks responsible for methanol selectivity as well as for carbon monoxide hydrogenation activity and followed by fine tuning of these related variables, finally a catalyst with high methanol yield is prepared, MOS2/20 wt.-% KZC03/Mg0(40-60 wt.-%)-Si02.
