DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60299-9 REVIEW Thoughts on the Future Development of Zeolitic Catalysts from an Industrial Point of View LIU Zhicheng 1 , WANG Yangdong 1 , XIE Zaiku 2, * 1 Shanghai Research Institute of Petrochemical Technology, SINOPEC, Shanghai 201208, China 2 SINOPEC, Beijing 100027, China Abstract: Problems and challenges in the production and catalysis of zeolitic catalysts were addressed from an industrial point of view. The recent progress as well as discuss developments in zeolitic catalysts was reviewed. The highly efficient catalysis of zeolitic catalysts, the synthesis and application of novel zeolitic catalysts, the economic production of zeolites as well as the application of zeolites to environ- mental protection and green chemistry, etc., were covered. It is intended to stimulate thought and focus on the future development of zeolitic catalysts with regard to economic synthesis, catalyst design, high efficiency catalysis, green processes, new applications, etc. Key words: zeolite; industrial catalyst; petrochemical industry; development; high efficiency catalysis; economic synthesis; green process In the chemical industry most processes (more than 80%) involve catalysis especially in the petroleum and chemical industries. Catalysts are indispensable in many processes and zeolitic catalysts are important in these processes. The indus- trial application of zeolitic catalysts began in the 1960s when the FAU zeolite was the first to be used in the oil refining industry instead of the silica-alumina FCC catalyst by the former Mobil Company. Zeolitic catalysts are superior in terms of gasoline production and the utilization of crude oil com- pared to the conventional silica-alumina catalyst [1]. Currently, as a refinery catalyst, zeolitic catalysts occupy about 18.5% of the global catalyst manufacturing business [2]. Zeolitic cata- lysts have many distinctive advantages such as a regular pore system and a large inner micropore surface area, are compara- ble with H 2 SO 4 and AlCl 3 , have molecular sieve or shape-selective properties, are amenable to modification or doping, etc. They have been widely used in many industrial catalysis processes including oil refinery and petroleum chemical processes such as catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, oligomerization, m-reforming, lube hydrotreating, dispropor- tionation, isomerization, alkylation, aromatics transalkylation, olefins catalytic cracking, methanol to gasoline, aromatization of olefins, alkylation of benzene, propylene or ethylene, and some fine chemical or coal chemical processes such as selec- tive catalytic oxidation and methanol to olefins conversion (Table 1). The highly efficient catalysis of zeolitic catalysts has been very profitable for the petroleum and chemical industry. However, with the increase in petroleum product consump- tion and the shortage of crude oil resources worldwide in ad- dition to changes in the composition and sources of raw mate- rials (increase in the heavy compositions in the crude oil), coal, natural gas, and bio-ethanol have become alternative resources, etc. Additionally, with the increased demand for energy saving and environment protection, improvements and innovation in the petrochemical industry technology are highly desirable. The development of new technologies such as heavy crude oil deep processing, coal or other alternative resources chemical processing, highly efficient transformation of low value side products, synthesis of high value special petroleum products, energy saving and consumption reducing technology, CO 2 chemical utilization, etc. is in demand. Most of these new technologies should involve innovations in the development of catalysts and in the development of zeolitic catalysts. From an industrial point of view, to achieve industrial goals such as high efficiency or atomic economic utilization of resources, energy savings and a reduction in consumption as well as environ- mental friendliness, many problems and challenges exist for the future development of zeolitic catalysts such as maximizing LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 the efficiency of the zeolitic catalysts, the production of zeolitic catalysts by rational design, the economic synthesis of zeolites, and new applications of zeolitic catalysts. The main problems or challenges are listed in detail as follows. (1) One of the challenges is the rational design of the zeolitic catalysts according to the desired catalytic reaction because different industrial catalytic reactions have different requirements for the catalysts and the requirements may often be influenced by a change in the resources and in the product market. The precise control of pore size and shape, morphol- ogy of crystallites, chemical composition of the zeolitic mate- rials, acid strength and distribution, etc. are important. (2) Another challenge is to improve the catalytic effi- ciency and the other properties of the zeolitic catalysts that are currently used in the industrial catalytic reactions. Many ques- tions need to be answered such as the type of pores within the zeolites that improve performance and how to improve the utilization of pores and catalytic efficiency, whether zeolite pores can be changed or increased, the effect of framework heteroatoms on the catalytic performance, the development of surface chemistry or surface modifications on the zeolites, etc. (3) The third challenge is to search for and synthesize new zeolites with improved catalytic performance, which may result in innovations in the developed processes and technolo- gies. The discovery of new useful zeolite materials is relatively difficult and requires creative work to produce large pore zeo- lites with high hydrothermal stability, chiral zeolites and other molecular sieves with novel structures, etc. Although there are almost 190 kinds of zeolite topologies the individual features, the kinds of zeolites that have higher catalytic performance and the kinds of zeolites that have potential application in industry need to be studied in detail. (4) Some zeolites show excellent performance and these are potentially useful in industry. However, their production costs are currently too high because they are synthesized using expensive organic structural directing agents (SDA).

(5) Studying new applications of zeolites in fields such as the fine chemical industry, green chemistry or environmental protection, etc. is also of interest. We thus review some recent progress as well as discuss the development of zeolitic catalysts according to the challenges and questions listed above. 1 Highly efficient catalysis of zeolitic catalysts For industrial zeolites, high performance is a basic re- quirement. The type and amount of active centers as well as the diffusive properties of micropores are intrinsic factors for catalytic materials that determine their catalytic activities. Catalytic selectivity is closely related to the shape-selectivity of micropores, the side reactions, and the molecular diffusion rates. Lifetime is an important property of a catalyst and pro- longing their lifetime is always important. If the catalytic ac- tivity of a catalyst is high enough and the catalyst cokes easily it can still be used for long periods in a suitable reaction process if it has good generation properties. Therefore, good per- formance is not only related to the catalytic materials but also to a combination of the reaction process and the engineering system, which helps in obtaining good performance for the zeolitic catalysts in real industrial applications. The following is a discussion about improving the catalytic efficiency of the zeolitic catalysts. 1.1 Crystal size and morphology control Because the micropore size of most of zeolites is often less than 1 nm, the diffusion of small organic molecules would be limited by their pore channels, which may result in inadequate pore utilization and a relatively low catalytic activity. De- creasing the zeolite crystal size or changing their morphology should be effective in improving the diffusion properties and utilization of pores. Small or nano crystallites should have a shorter diffusion path and a larger extent of pore utilization than large crystallites, which would result in better catalytic performance. Therefore, since the 1990s studies on nanozeo- lites have aroused great interest in this field and many nanozeolites with LTA [5], LTL [6], MFI [7], BEA [8] struc- tures, etc. have been successfully synthesized. Nanozeolites show better catalytic performance than regular-size zeolites [9]. SAPO-34 molecular sieves with a CHA topology are con- sidered to be one of the most effective industrial catalysts for the methanol to olefins (MTO) conversion process. Recently, Yang et al. [10] studied the effect of crystal size and mor- phology of SAPO-34 on the production of olefins and the lifetime of catalysts. They found that the crystal size and morphology of SAPO-34 greatly influenced their catalytic performance, for example, smaller or lamellar crystallites gave better catalytic performance (higher yield of C 2 and C 3 olefins and working over longer periods) than larger crystallites. Recently, Choi et al. [11] successfully synthesized multi- or single-lamellar MFI nanosheets that were created by the co- herent assembly of a zeolite layer and a structure directing agent as well as a diquaternary ammonium surfactant with relatively long hydrocarbon chains. These zeolite nanosheets were found to have a much lower deactivation or coking rate for the conversion of methanol to gasoline (MTG). However, many problems are evident during the synthesis and use of small particle- or nanozeolites, for example, they agglomerate easily during their synthesis process, which re- quires the carefully control of gel composition and synthesis conditions. They also agglomerate easily during drying and calcination, which may reduce their catalytic performance. The synthesis of nanozeolites often involves the use of expensive organic SDA, which may result in a low production yield and high cost. In addition, when using nanozeolites, especially in a liquid catalytic system, the nanoparticles are not easy to sepa- rate from the liquid products, which may result in recycling difficulties. All these difficult problems mentioned need to be resolved before their practical application. 1.2 Zeolites with hierarchical pores Zeolite-based hierarchical porous materials with two or more levels of porosity, especially mesoporous zeolites have received much attention recently. Most reported mesoporous silicas or aluminosilicates have properties such as unsatisfied thermal stability, are just short of being strong acids and easily lose acid centers because their walls are not crystalline but are amorphous although their pores may be periodic and regular. While zeolites have good structural stability and are strong acids they have a molecular diffusion limitation, which influ- ences their catalytic activity and selectivity. However, hierar- chical porous zeolites may combine the advantages of common zeolites with efficient mass transport and large porous mo- lecular sieves. Recently, some hierarchical porous zeolites have been synthesized using carbon black [12], carbon nanotubes [13], starch [14], nanosized CaCO 3 [15], polymers (PDDA[16], PVB [17], etc.), and amphiphilic organosilane surfactants [18] as templates. Upon the direct hydrothermal crystallization of templates/silica composites the silica was transformed into zeolite whereas the templates were incorporated in the zeolite crystals. The removal of the templates inside the zeolite com- posite resulted in the opening of micropores and mesopores in the zeolites, respectively. An alternative route for hierarchical porous zeolites with crystalline walls is the recrystallization of the walls of SBA and MCM materials in the presence of mo- lecular templates [19]. Hierarchical porous zeolites give better catalytic perform- ance in reactions such as supercritical toluene disproportiona- LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 tion [20], alkylation of benzene with ethylene [12], and the transalkylation of heavy aromatics [21]. Recenty, Yang et al. [22] prepared a hierarchical beta zeolite by the dry gel con- version method. They found that the hierarchical beta zeolite gave better activity and had better stability than the conven- tional beta zeolite for the transalkylation reaction of diisopro- pylbenzene with benzene. Therefore, it is expected that hierarchical porous zeolites may have application in large molecule catalysis or in liquid catalytic reaction systems in the future. 1.3 Composite zeolites by co-crystallization or intergrowth During the synthesis of zeolites, a pure zeolite phase can be obtained only when the synthesis parameters are well con- trolled while a variation in zeolite synthesis conditions will lead to the formation of co-crystallized zeolites with different phases. This is called co-crystallization. These mixtures may be regarded as physical mixtures in many cases and their structures and properties have been neglected. Only a few examples of the intergrowth zeolites from co-crystallization such as the intergrowth of zeolites X/A, MFI/MEL, FAU/EMT, and STF/SFF with their analogous basic structures have been reported. Some co-crystallized zeolites show better perform- ance than the individual pure phases, for example, ZSM-5/ZSM-11 (MFI/MEL) is a kind of intergrowth zeolite and it can be used to adjust the product composition of gasoline over a wide range in the methanol to gasoline conversion process [23]. The composite zeolites obtained by co-crystallization or intergrowth can have precisely adjusted pore and acid systems, which may be effective in improving their catalytic performance. Recently, Xie et al. [24] carried out a series of investigations on MCM-49/ZSM-35 that was synthesized by the crystal transformation of MCM-49 or in a mixed amine system con- taining hexamethyleneimine and cyclohexamine. They found that the MCM-49 and ZSM-35 analogues in the co-crystallized zeolites may be stacked much closer than those in the physical mixture and some parts of the intergrowth may be formed because of the partially similar basic structure of MCM-49 and ZSM-35. They also observed a notable synergistic effect dur- ing the FCC gasoline updating process in which MCM-49/ZSM-35 showed a higher aromatization ability than pure MCM-49 [25]. They also observed a similar synergistic effect for MCM-49/ZSM-35 during aromatization in 1-butene conversion. Even though a small amount of MCM-49 was present in MCM-49/ZSM-35 this co-crystallized zeolite showed a relatively high aromatization conversion [26]. Qi et al. [27] investigated BEA/MOR (a co-crystalline zeo- lite of beta and mordenite) zeolite and they found enhanced acid properties and catalytic activity for methanol dehydration compared with the individual pure beta or mordenite zeolite. Co-crystallized or intergrowth zeolites have not been fully studied and their special intergrowth structures, properties, and catalytic performances need to be investigated further. 1.4 Surface modification of zeolite for better hydrothermal stability Thermal stability and hydrothermal stability are important properties of a zeolitic catalyst. Many industrial reactions require high thermal stability and high hydrothermal stability, which is often important for the life of the catalyst and it de- termines the selection of the catalytic process. For example, the catalytic cracking of mixed C 4 - or C 5 -olefins to produce propylene and ethylene requires a steam atmosphere and, therefore, the hydrothermal stability of the zeolite catalysts is very important for catalyst development. It has been reported that phosphorus modification or the incor- poration of heteroatoms are effective methods to increase the hydrothermal stability of zeolites [28]. Zhao et al. [29] pre- pared a series of catalysts for C 4 -olefin cracking by impreg- nating HZSM-5 with different amounts of phosphoric acid followed by calcination in air at high temperature. The intro- duction of a suitable amount of phosphorus into the HZSM-5 zeolite can slow down coke deposition and dealumination, which are the main causes of HZSM-5 deactivation. A syner- gistic interaction may exist between the phosphorus oxide species and the Si-O-Al framework within the zeolite pore channels, which is good for optimizing the acid strength and distribution, reducing the side reactions of hydrogen transfer, and increasing the selectivity for propylene. To describe the exact structure of the new acids that form in P/HZSM-5 during steam treatment Xue et al. [30] used D 2 /OH exchange and solid-state 31 P and 27 Al NMR measurements to investigate the change in acid centers before and after phospho- rus-modification. They also proposed a model with the assis- tance of a computer simulation. They found that the new acid sites that were generated by phosphorus-modification seem to be related to phosphorus entering the zeolitic at the position left by dealumination and stabilized by some extra-lattice alumi- num. The introduction of phosphorus to the zeolitic framework protects the residual framework aluminum against further dealumination. The integrated effect results in hydrothermally stable acid sites in P-modified HZSM-5 and enhances the catalytic performance toward C 4 olefin cracking after steam treatment at high temperature. For the methanol dehydration to olefins, a large amount of water is generated in the product mixtures and, therefore, the zeolitic catalyst should be able to withstand steam treatment and regeneration at high temperatures. Because the SAPO-34 zeolite has good thermal and hydrothermal stability it has been the catalytic material of choice for the MTO process. For naphtha cracking to olefins the reaction temperature often reaches 600 Â°C and, therefore, the thermal and hydro- LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 thermal stability of the catalyst are very important. Many other refining and petrochemical reactions require catalysts with good thermal and hydrothermal stability. The search for highly stable catalytic materials and methods to improve their stability are essential subjects and are worth studying. 2 Synthesis and application of zeolites with novel structures 2.1 Large or extra-large pore molecular sieves Although zeolitic catalysts have been widely used in many small molecular reactions in the petrochemical and fine chemical industry, they are hardly used in large molecule (e.g. heavy compositions of crude oil, fine chemicals, or organic intermediates) catalysis because of their small micropore size. Therefore, the synthesis of large (12-membered rings (MR)) or extra-large pore (12-MR above) zeolites has been an important subject over the last 30 years (Table 2). VPI-5, an aluminophosphate molecular sieve, is the first example of a large pore molecular sieve and its pore size ex- ceeds 1 nm. It has a large pore size of 1.2 nm and a 30% void ratio. This discovery of large pore zeolites opened a new area in the zeolite research field. Many microporous materials with large or extra-large pores (including aluminosilicates, alu- minophosphates, germanosilicates, etc.) have been synthesized or discovered (Table 2). Among these large or extra-large pore molecular sieves, aluminophosphates have a relatively low framework stability, e.g. JDF-20 and ND-1 collapse after the removal of the organic templates within the pores. Large or extra-large pore aluminosilicates (or zeolites) have fairly good stability, e.g. UTD-1 and CIT-5 have comparable stability to that of small pore zeolites [42]. Therefore, from a stability point of view, large or extra-large pore zeolites are more useful than aluminophosphates in future industrial applications. Cormaâ€™s group has synthesized a series of germanosilicates including some large or extra-large pore silicates such as ITQ-21 [50], ITQ-24 [51], ITQ-33 [55], ITQ-43 [59], ITQ-44 [58], etc. Among them, ITQ-21 has a three-dimensional channel system with circular openings comprising 12-membered rings and three linear channels that intersect to produce large inner cavities, and every cavity can be entered into through six windows. ITQ-21 was found to be more active Table 2 Microporous materials with large or super large pore Material Year reported Main framework composition Ring size (TO) Pore size (nm) Reference VPI-5 1988 AlPO 4 18 1.2 [31] AlPO 4 -8 1990 GaPO 4 14 <1.0 [32,33] Cloverite 1991 GaPO 4 20 <1.0 [34] JDF-20 1992 AlPO 4 20 collapse upon activation [35] ULM-5 1994 GaPO 4 16 not reported [36] AIMepO-Î² 1995 Al 2 (CH 3 PO 3 ) 3 18 0.6 [37] Not named 1996 V 5 O 9 (PO 4 ) 2 16 not reported [38] ULM-16 1996 GaPO 4 16 not reported [39] UTD-1 1996 SiO 2 14 1.0 [40] ULM-15 1997 FePO 4 16 not reported [41] CIT-5 1997 SiO 2 14 1.0 [42] ASU-31 1999 InS 4 24 2.56 [43] ASU-32 1999 InS 4 24 1.47 [43] VSB-1 1999 NiPO 4 24 0.9 [44] ND-1 1999 ZnPO 4 24 1.48 [45] VSB-5 2001 NiPO 4 24 1.0 [46] FDU-4 2001 GeO 2 24 1.26 [47] NTHU-1 2001 GaPO 4 24 1.1 [48] OSB-1 2001 Si 0.66 Be 0.33 O 2 14 0.73 [49] ITQ-21 2002 Si(Ge)O 2 12 1.18 [50] ITQ-24 2003 Si(Ge)O 2 12 0.68 [51] SSZ-53 2003 B 1.6 Si 62.4 O 128 14 0.87 [52] SSZ-59 2003 B 0.35 Si 15.65 O 32 14 0.85 [52] ECR-34 2003 Si 0.75 Ga 0.24 Al 0.01 O 2 18 1.01 [53] IM-12 2004 Si(Ge)O 2 14 0.95 [54] ITQ-33 2006 Si(Ge)O 2 18 1.22 [55] ITQ-37 2009 Si(Ge)O 2 30 1.93 [56] ITQ-40 2010 Si(Ge)O 2 16 not reported [57] ITQ-44 2010 Si(Ge)O 2 18 1.25 [58] ITQ-43 2011 Si(Ge)O 2 23 2.19 [59] LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 than USY for catalytic cracking and produced more propylene in the gas fraction while giving less olefinic gasoline with a higher RON and MON [50]. ITQ-33 possesses straight large pore channels with circular openings of 18-rings along the c axis interconnected in a bidirectional system that consists of 10-ring channels. This material is very active during the alky- lation and transalkylation of alkyl aromatics as well as during the dealkylation of bulky alkylaromatics containing one or two condensed aromatic rings. It is also good for producing more diesel and less gasoline while maintaining the propylene and butene yield during the catalytic cracking of vacuum gasoil [55]. Therefore, if the stability and economy of synthesis were further improved, it is expected that large or extra-large pore zeolites such as ITQ-21 and ITQ-33 may be applied to the refining and petrochemical industries in future. 2.2 Chiral molecular sieves Highly selective reactions including asymmetric catalytic reactions have become important research topics and may have potential applications in pharmaceuticals, agriculture chemi- cals, food additives, etc. A zeolitic asymmetric catalyst may be prepared by the immobilization of chiral coordination com- pounds or metallo-organic compound catalysts on zeolite supports. However, the stability and lifetime of these catalysts is often unsatisfactory for real applications because of the relatively weak bonds of the chiral group with the surface of the zeolite. When chiral zeolites are synthesized the stability of the catalysts are readily determined. Davis et al. [60] synthe- sized chiral beta zeolite templated by a chiral organic amine but the enantiomer selectivity of the beta zeolite was only 5%, which was identified by a light reaction test. Stuckyâ€™s group synthesized NaZnPO 4 [61], NaCoPO 4 [62], and gallium ger- manate UCSB-7 [63] with chiral structures or pores. Recently, Zouâ€™s group [64] reported two chiral germanosilicates SU-15 and SU-32. Although practical application of these chiral mo- lecular sieves has not been achieved, good basic research into their chiral catalysis has been carried out. 2.3 Other zeolites with novel structures MWW zeolite is a new kind of silica layered zeolite that contains large zeolites including MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-36, MCM-56, PSH-3, SSZ-25, ERB-1, ITQ-1, ITQ-2, EMM-10, EMM-12, EMM-13 [65], etc. Its framework topol- ogy consists of two independent pore systems, one formed by two-dimensional sinusoidal channels and the other by large supercages (0.71 nm Ã— 0.71 nm Ã— 1.82 nm). MWW zeolite is different to other zeolites as it has a high concentration of external pockets with 12-ring openings and an approximate depth of 0.71 nm. Because of its unusual crystalline structure, high microporosity, highly hydrothermal stability, and mild acid performance it is not surprising that the MWW zeolite has good catalytic performance properties for many reactions such as olefin isomerization, alkylation for ethylbenzene or cumene production, catalytic cracking or hydrocracking, dispropor- tionation of toluene, aromatization, etc. [66]. Therefore, studies into the MWW zeolite have been a popular zeolite research area over the last 20 years. One big commercial application of the MCM-22 zeolite catalyst has been introduced by the Exxon-Mobil Company for the production of cumene by the liquid-phase alkylation in the new Mobil/Badger-Raytheon process [67]. This process has a low reaction temperature and the catalyst has a long lifetime while high selectivity for cu- mene products is obtained (99.99%). Therefore, this process was quickly substituted for old processes based on zeolite ZSM-5 or beta zeolite worldwide. In addition, MWW zeolite has also been used industrially in ethylbenzene production [68]. EU-1 (EUO) zeolite with 10-MR straight pore channels and vertically connected side pockets has better catalytic per- formance, activity, and selectivity toward xylene isomerization [69]. Therefore, the EU-1 zeolite is a good candidate for a new generation of industrial catalysts for xylene isomerization. Medium pore zeolites with unconnected one dimensional pore channels such as TON, MTT, EUO, AEL, etc. have better production or selectivity as dual functional hydrocarbon hy- droisomerisation catalysts than conventional ZSM-5, ZSM-11, or beta zeolite and may be applied industrially in the future [70,71]. 3 Economic synthesis of zeolites Some zeolites may be synthesized in an inorganic system with inorganic cations e.g. zeolite A, P, Mordernite, X, Y, and L. Other zeolites need to be synthesized using organic SDAs such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, beta, MCM-22, SAPO-34, and TS-1. Compared with the zeolite synthesized in inorganic systems, zeolite products that are prepared by organic SDA often have better crystallinity, crystal size, and Si/Al ratios, and these properties are also easier to control. However, their cost is much higher. Many new zeolites are often synthesized using expensive organic SDAs and their production costs are very high. Therefore, much effort has been put into reducing the production cost of zeolites by the substitution of expensive organic SDAs with cheaper and environmental friendly SDAs or by organic template-free synthesis. 3.1 Substitution of the organic structure directing agents It has been recognized that the organic SDAs used is in ex- cess of that occluded in zeolite crystals, which means that only a minor portion of the SDA that was used specifies the nu- cleation and growth of the zeolite product while in the rest a large portion of amine was used to provide both pore filling and basicity capacity in the synthesis. Zones et al. [72] developed a LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 new approach by adding multi-organic amines and one of these amines acted as a SDA while other cheaper amines were used to fill pores and to adjust the basicity. In one example, except for the addition of quaternized aminoadamantane, which was needed for the synthesis of SSZ-25 (MWW) a cheap isobu- tylamine was also used to partly substitute for expensive aminoadamantane. This synthesis route offers cost-saving benefits by reducing the costs associated with SDAs, waste stream cleanup costs as well as the time in the reactor and the reagent flexibility was increased too. Similarly, they synthesized SSZ-13 (CHA), SSZ-33 (CON), SSZ-35 (STF), and SSZ-42 (IFR) [73] by partly substituting expensive aminoadamantane with N,N,N- trimethyl aniline. Bull et al. [74] synthesized SSZ-13 by combining aminoada- mantane and tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The multi SDAs method not only reduces the cost but also has the added benefit of adjusting the phase composition, the Si/Al ratio, and the crystal size of the product. One example is SSZ-47, which is a complex intergrowth of the three framework types; EUO, NES, and NON. The presence of NON in this intergrowth can greatly reduce the sorption capacity and the ease of diffusion. SSZ-47B is prepared using a combination of two SDAs and it has a relatively lower level of NON, which results in a much higher sorption capacity [75]. Another example is SSZ-32X (MTT), which has also been prepared using the two SDAs method [76]. Compared to the SSZ-32 prepared using imida- zolium SDA the SSZ-32X has a reduced Si/Al ratio and a reduced crystal size as well as better dewaxing catalytic per- formance. MCM-22 (MWW) is a new kind of industrial zeolite and it is now mainly produced using toxic hexamethyleneimine as the SDA. Lewis et al. [77â€“80] prepared a series of UZM zeolites using a combination of commercially available SDAs. Among them, UZM-8 (MWW) was prepared using tetraethylammo- nium hydroxide (TEAOH) and Et 2 Me 2 NOH as the SDAs [80], which is advantageous in terms of their production cost and environmentally friendliness when compared to hexamethyl- eneimine as the SDA. Wang et al. [81] reported the successful synthesis of AFI aluminophosphate and its heteroatom compounds using cheap and environmentally friendly tetramethylguanidine as the SDA. 3.2 Organic template-free synthesis A low cost organic structure directing agent (OSDA) or al- ternatively organic-free synthesis is desired in industry. The addition of crystalline seed to the preparation system has been shown to be an effective method to decrease the OSDA. EU-1 [82], ZSM-11 [83], ZSM-12 [84], SSZ-28 [85], SSZ-32 [86], and SSZ-35 [87] were synthesized by this method with a SDA/SiO 2 molar ratio as low as 0.02â€“0.05. However, obtaining a synthesis route without OSDA is still a challenge. In the 1980s a new route to prepare ZSM-5 without OSDA was developed and subsequently applied in industry by Li and Xiang et al. [88]. Wang et al. [89] and Clearfield et al. [90] then synthesized the ZSM-5 zeolite under an ammonium environ- ment using amorphous aluminum silicate as a precursor. Re- cently, Xiao et al. [91] developed an amine-free strategy to prepare zeolites in which zeolite seeds or a gel initiating agent was added to promote the growth of zeolite crystals. By adding a gel initiating agent such as zeolite Y, zeolite L, or calcined beta zeolite seed ECR-1 [92], ZSM-34 [93], and beta zeolites [94] were synthesized without OSDA. However, the Si/Al ratio of the beta zeolite product was relatively low. Furthermore, Kaminura et al. [95] tried to increase the Si/Al ratio of the beta zeolite and investigated the crystal formation process of OSDA in detail. They suggested that the beta seeds in the OSDA-free Na + -aluminosilicate gel system provided a growth surface for new beta crystals but they did not induce the nucleation of new beta crystals [96]. Using the above-mentioned OSDA-free method, many low silica zeolites including FAU, MOR [97], AMA, CHA, and high silica zeolites including ZSM-5, TUN-7 [98], ECR-1 [92], ZSM-34 [93], Ferrierite [99], beta [94,95], RTH [100], MTW [101], etc. have been synthesized. Economic and environmental advantages give the OSDA-free route more of a chance to be taken up in industry. However, compared with the conventional OSDA strategy some challenges still exist. First, during OSDA-free synthesis it takes a relatively long period to achieve highly crystalline zeolite products despite seed being used. Second, the range of the Si/Al ratio is relatively narrow and it is not easily adjusted by the OSDA-free method. Third, without the effect of OSDA the prevention of impure crystal growth and the modulation of crystal size are challenging. Although it has been reported that some trials were conducted on the OSDA-free method in in- dustry [100] more technologies should be developed to solve the above problems. 4 New applications With the increase in zeolite research more applications for zeolites have been developed in various fields such as adsorp- tion, ion-exchange, gas separation, selective catalytic oxida- tion, selective catalytic reduction of NO x , and other green processes. ETS-4, which was found by Kuznicki et al. [102] in 1989 is a kind of microporous titanosilicate that possesses tetrahedral silicon atoms and octahedral titanium atoms in its framework. The ETS-4 framework can be systematically contracted by dehydration at elevated temperature to â€œtuneâ€� the effective size of the pores and this is referred to as the molecular gate effect [103]. Using this special characteristic, ETS-4 has been used by the Engelhard Corporation to separate N 2 and CO 2 from natural gas during its transportation by pipeline. LIU Zhicheng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 22â€“38 Moreover, microporous titanosilicates such as TS-1 [104], TS-2 [105], Ti-MWW etc. have been used as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions such as the oxidation of phenol to hydroquinone, the oxidation of cyclohexanone ammonia to cyclohexanone oxime, the epoxidation of propylene etc., using H 2 O 2 as an oxide, and these are new green processes. Over the past few decades, many researchers have paid attention to the synthesis of new titanosilicates such as Ti-beta [106â€“108], Ti-ZSM-12 [109], Ti-ZSM-48 [110], Ti-mordenite [111], Ti-SSZ-33 [112], Ti-ITQ-7 [113], Ti-MCM-22 (Ti-MWW) [114â€“116], Ti-MCM-56 [117] etc., to try increase the amount of tetrahedral titanium atoms in the framework [118] and, furthermore, to explore industrial applications. In China, Re- search Institute of Petroleum Processing (RIPP) of SINOPEC and East China Normal University have done much work on titanosilicates e.g. the production of hollow TS-1 [119] and Ti-MWW [120], which has encouraged us to look forward to more applications of titanosilicate zeolites in the green chem- istry industry. Zeolite is also available as an effective catalyst in the envi- ronmental field. The highly efficient selective reduction of NO x from the emission of lean burn engines and diesel engines has attracted much attention all over the world recently. It has been reported that zeolites that contain transition metal ions such as Cu/SAPO-34 [121], Cu/Beta [122], Fe/Beta [122], Cu/ZSM-5 [123] et al., demonstrate high efficiency and selectivity in the selective catalytic reduction of NO x [124]. More applications for zeolitic catalysts are expected. 5 Prospects for zeolites and zeolitic catalysis The application of zeolites in industry as catalysts began 50 years ago. Over the past few decades zeolites have played important roles in oil refining, petrochemicals, and in separa- tions and they have made chemical processes more effective and economic. However, over the last decade more challenges have arisen in the development of the conventional petro- chemical industry. Awareness about energy conservation and environmental protection by the reduction or transformation of greenhouse gases is important. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the development of new chemical conversion routes from coal, natural gas, and biomass resources. Increas- ing the efficiency of zeolites as catalysts, designing and syn- thesizing catalysts depending on demand and more importantly the development of economic routes and more applications of zeolites has been a focus. With the further development of zeolite chemistry more zeolites with new structures will be synthesized and this will enrich the types of zeolites and also lead to a greater amount of choice in terms of catalysis routes or processes in industry. Old industrial zeolites will be replaced by new zeolites with high performance, which will help increase the efficiency and economy of the old processes. New catalytic processes may also be developed because of the new zeolitic catalysts. In addition, as for conventional zeolites new manufacturing technologies to control the crystal size, the pore size and morphology such as in nanosized zeolites, the hierarchical porous zeolites, and special morphology zeolites such as la- mellar and needle-like will advance improvements in catalysis processes. On the other hand, it is expected that chiral zeolites will be developed in fields such as fine chemicals, medicines, pesticides, and separations in future and this may be of interest to the chemical industry. Besides the petrochemical industry, zeolites will find more application in green chemistry and in environmental applications such as in the selective oxidation, selective catalytic reduction of NO x , etc. With the development of technologies and the reduction in costs, zeolites will play more important roles in industry and in our lives.
