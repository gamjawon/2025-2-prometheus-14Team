Graphical abstract By employing ssNMR techniques on PVCN-SPE, a cross-linked SPE, two types of Li ions associated with different polymer segments are identified. The VC to EO unit ratio in the network affects crystallization prevention, enhancing ion mobility. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have become increasingly important in advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their improved safety and mechanical properties compared to organic liquid electrolytes. Cross-linked polymers have the potential to further improve the mechanical property without trading off Li-ion conductivity. In this study, focusing on a recently developed cross-linked SPE, i.e., the one based on poly(vinylene carbonate)-poly(ethylene oxide) cross-linked network (PVCN), we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate the fundamental interaction between the chain segments and Li ions, as well as the lithium-ion motion. By utilizing homonuclear/heteronuclear correlation, CP (cross-polarization) kinetics, and spin–lattice relaxation experiments, etc., we revealed the structural characteristics and their relations to lithium-ion mobilities. It is found that the network formation prevents poly(ethylene oxide) chains from crystallization, which could create sufficient space for segmental tumbling and Li-ion conduction. As such, the mechanical property is greatly improved with even higher Li-ion mobilities compared to the poly(vinylene carbonate) or poly(ethylene oxide) based SPE analogues. Keywords ssNMR Lithium-ion mobility Cross-link Solid polymer electrolyte 1 Introduction Solvent-based electrolytes are still prevalently used in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) nowadays but are flammable and often lead to battery safety concerns [1–3]. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), i.e., solid-solutions of alkali metal salts in polymers, have drawn increasing attention especially in recent years due to their safeness, cost-effectiveness, and preparation-robustness. Among SPEs, the ones based on cross-linked polymers are an important type as they can greatly enhance the mechanical properties and be more compatible with electrochemical demands [4,5]. However, maintaining their electrochemical properties after network formation can usually be challenging [6,7]. Recently, a promising polymer matrix of SPEs, poly(vinylene carbonate)-poly(ethylene oxide) crosslinking network, namely PVCN, has been developed and exhibits excellent tensile strength, thermal stability, and ionic conductivity for LIBs applications [8]. However, the critical reasons behind the structure-performance relations are not clear yet. As the electrochemical performance can be affected by multiple complicated factors including regional and macro-scaled chemical structures, interplay between distinct phases, crystallinity, molecular weight and overall mechanical properties, etc. [9], efficient and specialized characterization methods are strongly demanded [10–13]. Particularly, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is widely known to provide excellent solvation properties for Li salts due to its strong affinity for coordinating with Li ions, but usually has high glass transition temperatures [14]. Poly(vinylene carbonate) (PVC), on the other hand, possesses low glass-transition temperatures because of its amorphous structure, but is less efficient in conducting Li salts [15]. How can a network formation between these two polymers increase the mechanical property while not sacrificing (or actually rather improve) the electrochemical properties requires elucidation of the fundamental mechanism. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy is a well-known approach to investigate the morphology of polymer materials [16–18], and has been widely employed for determining ion kinetics and diffusion mechanism of SPEs [19–24]. Li-ion kinetics including activation energy, jump rate, correlation time, etc., are typically investigated by relaxometry, chemical exchange and/or variable temperature (VT) NMR experiments. For example, Yao et al. revealed the kinetics of Li ions and the PEO segments in the α-cyclodextrin nanochannel by combining the two-dimensional (2D) 7Li-7Li chemical exchange experiment with VT 2H NMR line shape analysis [25]. In another work, chemical environment and ion kinetics have been examined by employing variable-temperature 7Li and 19F NMR line shape analysis and spin–lattice relaxation (SLR) time measurements [26]. Yet, it should also be noted that NMR studies on SPE materials can often be complicated by strong 1H–1H and 7Li-7Li homonuclear dipolar couplings [27], which requires high-field and fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) rates for resolution enhancement [28–31]. In this work, we employ ssNMR experiments to investigate PVCN and PVC based SPEs (denoted as PVCN-SPE and PVC-SPE, respectively), i.e., PVC polymer backbones with and without PEO cross-linking. During the SPE preparation, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) were separately used as a solvent and a nucleophile for improving oxidation-resistant ability of SPEs, which further complicates the system and thus characterizations. As such, high-field (up to 18.8 T) and ultra-fast MAS (up to 60 kHz) were employed to improve the resolution of 1H NMR spectra to disentangling the detailed cross-linking structure. 1H-7Li HETCOR (heteronuclear correlation), CP (cross-polarization) kinetics [32,33], and VT SLR [34] experiments were carried out and revealed two types of Li ions and their associated kinetics. Data suggest that the network formation prevents PEO chains from crystallizing, which creates sufficient space for Li-ion pathways and segmental tumbling, thereby boosting ion mobility and enabling rapid lithium-ion conduction. In addition, the network structure could stabilize the segregation of polymer chains during charge–discharge cycles, thus conducive to improving the cycling performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Polyoxyethylene bis(amine) (POEA, 2000 Da) was purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. β-amino-propionitrile (BAPN, 98%) was supplied by Meryer Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, 300000 Da) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%) was supplied by Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Lithium oxalyldifluroborate (LiODFB, 99.5%) was supplied by Jiangsu Guotai Super Power New Materials Co., Ltd. 2.2 Sample preparation The samples were prepared using the same method as in the previous article [8]. The methods are shown below: PVC was synthesized beforehand via free radical polymerization. For PVCN-SPE preparation, 0.12 g of PVC with a molecular weight of 1.671 × 104 Da and 0.12 g of POEA with a molecular weight of 2000 Da were separately added to 1.2 g of DMF at ambient temperature and stirred for 10 min. The two solutions were then mixed, and 12 μL of BAPN was added to form the PVCN. Subsequently, 0.0288 g of lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) was added to the mixture. The mixture was cast onto a Teflon petri dish to dry, resulting in self-standing PVCN-SPE films. For PVC-SPE preparation, 0.12 g of PVC was added to 1.2 g of DMF at ambient temperature and stirred for 10 min. 12 μL of BAPN and 0.0288 g of LiDFOB were added to the mixture. The mixture was cast onto a Teflon petri dish to dry, resulting in PVC-SPE films. All the samples were dried in an oven at 80 °C for more than 72 h to reduce solvent and moisture residues. They were then crushed and packed into 3.2 mm and 1.3 mm NMR rotors in a glove box. 2.3 NMR experiments Ultra-fast MAS 1D 1H, 2D 1H–1H NOESY and DQ-SQ (double-quantum single-quantum) homonuclear correlation NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 800 spectrometer with a standard-bore magnet under a magnetic field of 18.8 T equipped with 1.3 mm HX DVT probe. Other experiments, including 1D 1H, 7Li, and 13C ssNMR, 2D heteronuclear correlations, CP kinetics, and SLR time at variable temperatures experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer with a wide-bore magnet under a magnetic field of 14.1 T in combination of a 3.2 mm HXY DVT probe. Detailed ssNMR experimental parameters for all spectra, including magnetic field strength (B 0), MAS rate, recycle delay, number of scans, F1 sampling points, t 1 increment time, RF field strength, CP contact time, mixing time, and dipolar recoupling time for other dipolar recoupling sequences, were given in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Some important parameters were also shown below for clarification. 1D 1H→7Li/13C CP MAS NMR experiments were carried out using ramped CP, while 1H→7Li CP kinetics experiments employed square CP for acquisition at Larmor frequencies of 600.13 MHz and 233.23 MHz for 1H and 7Li, respectively. In the 1D 1H→7Li CP MAS NMR experiments, the CP contact time was set to 1500 μs with an recycle delay of 2 s and an MAS rate of 18 kHz. For the CP kinetics experiments, the CP contact time ranged from 100 to 5000 μs with all other parameters consistent with the 1D CP experiments. Ultra-fast MAS 1H NMR experiments were carried out at a Larmor frequency of 800.30 MHz of 1H at a MAS rate of 60 kHz. 1D spectra were acquired using a π/2 pulse of 2.7 μs and a recycle delay of 1.5 s. 2D 1H–1H NOESY spectra were acquired using a mixing time of 1, 10, and 50 ms, a π/2 pulse of 2.7 μs, and a recycle delay of 2 s. For the 2D 1H–1H DQ-SQ NMR experiments, DQ coherences were excited and reconverted using a R 14 4 5 recoupling sequence [35,36] with the 1H radio frequency at 105 kHz and the recoupling time of 133.28 μs. 256 scans were accumulated for each of the 64 F1 increments with an increment time of 33.3 μs. Variable temperature 7Li SLR time experiments were obtained under static conditions at a Larmor frequency of 233.23 MHz for 7Li, using a standard 3.2 mm ZrO2 rotors and a Vespel® cap. The temperature was calibrated with KBr [37], and varied from 213 to 418 K. 1D single-pulse experiments were obtained using a π/2 pulse of 4.05 μs and a recycle delay of 10 to 100 s, depending on the SLR time of 7Li at a specific temperature. Spin–lattice relaxation times in the laboratory frame were obtained using a saturation recovery [38–40] pulse sequence and the data were decomposed and separately fitted to the Eq. (1). (1) I = I 0 1 - e - τ T 1 where τ are variable delays. NMR spectra were referenced to adamantane for 1H chemical shift at 1.74 ppm and for 13C chemical shifts at 29.5 and 38.45 ppm, to 1 M LiCl for 7Li chemical shift at 0 ppm. 2.4 Data processing All the decompositions of 1D NMR experiments were achieved with DMFIT software [41]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure of the PVCN-SPE The preparation of PVCN and its Li-formed electrolyte is illustrated in Scheme 1 . It was discovered that both the mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of PVCN-SPE are improved compared to either the PEO-SPE or PVC-SPE analogues [8]. The stronger mechanical property, i.e., with a tensile strength of 22 MPa and an elongation-at-break value of 350%, is expected as a consequence of cross-linking; the better ionic conductivity than PEO-SPE and PVC-SPE, i.e., 4.5 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 333 K, however, is rather surprising and intriguing [8]. Prior to analyzing the Li-ion mobility, the investigation of the cross-linking details via 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy helps to understand the polymer segment connectivity, quantity, and mobility. Given the proton-rich backbones of both PVC and PEO segments, 1H–1H homonuclear dipolar couplings would be an issue (which results in homogeneous broadening that cannot be fully averaged by MAS [42]) for proton NMR spectroscopy. Fortunately, the resolution can be greatly enhanced by suppressing the homonuclear broadening employing high-field NMR and fast MAS rates, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). At the best resolution condition, i.e., 18.8 T and 60 kHz, multiple proton species can be resolved in 1H NMR spectra of both PVC and PVCN, as denoted in Fig. 1(b). Detailed assignments were assisted by a collection of 1D 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the organic-lithium salt complex and raw materials, including PVCN, PVC, PEO, polyoxyethylene bis(amine) (POEA), β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), etc., as illustrated in Fig. S1(a and b). After being cross-linked, PVCN inherits signals from PVC (δ 1H = 4.9 ppm and δ 13C = 77.8 ppm) and PEO (δ 1H = 3.6 ppm and δ 13C = 70.4 ppm) (see Fig. 1b and Fig. S1), according to the deconvoluted peaks in 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Fig. S1b and c). It is worth noting that the FWHMs (full width at half maximum) of the PEO segments signals in PVCN and PVCN-SPE are significantly larger than that of PEO-SPE and POEA-SPE. This indicates a significant reduction in the crystallinity of PEO segments (crystallinity degree ranging from 75% to 80% is usually observed for pure PEO at room temperature, limiting Li+ transportation [43]) and an enhancement in the amorphous character of the polymer. Other minor signals such as CH3, NH2, and HCO are observed in both PVCN-SPE and PVC-SPE, which shall be attributed to residual solvent DMF and antioxidant BAPN molecules, assisted by related NMR spectra in Fig. S1(a). 2D 1H–1H NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect SpectroscopY) [44] correlation spectrum shows strong cross peaks between PVC and PEO, as shown in Fig. 1(c). These NOESY cross peaks can be observed even at a relatively short mixing time of 1 ms (Fig. S2a), indicating the formation of the strong crosslinks. It should be noted that 2D 1H–1H DQ-SQ [35,36,45] experiment yields poor resolution for PVCN (see Fig. S2c), but better resolution for PVC (see Fig. S2d), possibly due to the much stronger dipolar network of the former. In addition to the PEO/PVC cross peak, DMF/PVC, DMF/PEO and BAPN/PVC cross peaks are also clearly observed (BAPN/PVC cross peak more resolved in the DQ-SQ spectrum in Fig. S2b), suggesting that these small molecules widely spread in the materials as an inevitable consequence of the SPE preparation. However, since the synthetic process of both PVC and PVCN based SPEs involves the addition of DMF and BAPN, and considering their small quantities according to the proton NMR spectrum in Fig. 1(b), it is reasonable to neglect their influence on the disparities in Li-ion mobilities investigated below. Overall, notably, the fine structural elucidation and correlation information provide crucial but complementary information to IR (infra-red) spectra [8] for further investigations of Li-ion mobility. 3.2 Li-ion mobility 1H→7Li CP MAS and 1H-7Li HETCOR NMR experiments were then carried out on PVCN-SPE to distinguish/analyze the Li-ion interaction with different chain segments, as depicted in Fig. 2 . Apparently, two peaks can be decomposed from 1D 1H→7Li CP MAS NMR spectrum (the experimental/simulated lines will not converge if using one component for simulation), i.e., a broad line and a narrow line denoted in green and blue colors, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The 2D 1H-7Li HETCOR spectrum was subsequently obtained at contact time of 1.4 ms, clearly showing that the broad line is primarily associated with PEO (δ 1H = 3.6 ppm) and the narrow line is associated with PEO and nearly all other 1H species including PVC (δ 1H = 4.9 ppm), as shown in Fig. 2(b). Further, the CP kinetics analysis in Fig. 2(c) shows that the broad signal builds up faster, indicating stronger apparent dipolar coupling interaction (which can be averaged by motional behaviors) between Li ions and protons compared to that of the narrow signal. Quantitative fittings of the CP curves with Equation S1 yields T LiH, i.e., the 1H→7Li cross relaxation time constants, of 670 and 431 μs, and T 1 ρ H , the 1H SLR time in the rotating-frame, of 3896 and 3261 μs, for the narrow and broad signals, respectively. With such information, it is rational to attribute the broad signal to Li ions relatively strongly coordinated to O atoms in the PEO segments (widely known in studies of PEO-SPEs [14]), and the narrow signal to Li ions stabilized by PVC chain segments and other functional groups including DMF, BAPN and anions. It should be emphasized that the narrow 7Li signal is also strongly correlated to PEO, evidenced from the extracted slice in Fig. 2(b), and also as shown in 2D 1H-7Li HETCOR spectrum with a long contact time (Fig. S3), the correlations with all proton species can be established for both 7Li signals, indicating the well dispersion effect on Li ions and thus great solvation capability for Li salt. The separation and assignment of the broad and narrow signals are essential as it provides a reliable way to track Li-ion movements associated to different parts in the crosslink, rather than an averaged evaluation obtained from, e.g., electrochemical experiments. Consequently, the mobility of Li ions giving rise to two signals is analyzed via assessing the temperature dependent 7Li NMR linewidth or the spin–lattice (T 1) relaxation (SLR) measurements [24,34,46]. Fig. 3 (a and b) show the static 7Li NMR spectra of the PVC and PVCN based SPEs acquired at 298 K, respectively. The narrow and broad components for PVCN-SPE discussed in the 7Li MAS NMR spectrum can also be deconvoluted in the static NMR spectrum, as indicated in blue and green colors in Fig. 3(b). Apparently, the 7Li linewidth is much broader for PVC than the narrow peak in PVCN, indicating slower mobility of Li ions in the former. As the measured linewidths of deconvoluted peaks gives rise to large uncertainties (Fig. S4), the Li mobility investigation is mainly relied on the SLR/VT analysis but not the linewidth/VT. Fig. 3(c) shows the 7Li SLR rates of PVC-SPE and the two lithium components in PVCN-SPE, respectively, plotted as a function of temperature. VT 7Li NMR spectra and detailed T 1 values (obtained by fittings via saturation recovery [38]) are illustrated in Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information, respectively. Further fittings of the temperature dependent T 1 values using the BPP (Bloembergen, Pound, and Purcell) theory [34] and Arrhenius equation (Equations S2 and S3) provide measures of the Li-ion kinetics, i.e., the activation energy and correlation time, as summarized in Table 1 . It is worth noting that the datapoints for the PVCN broad and narrow peaks at high temperatures above 363 K are discarded, because the broad and narrow peaks collapse at those temperatures and make deconvolution impractical. Values of E a and τ 0 are directly obtained from the fitting results and τ c at 298 K is calculated using Equation S3. Indeed, τ c, 298K might be more intuitive to the Li-ion mobility as it can be used to estimate the jump rate (τ −1) [46] of Li ions at 298 K. According to the calculated parameters in Table 1, the jump rate (τ c −1) of Li ions associated with the broad peak is slightly higher than that to the narrow peak, and Li ions in the PVC-SPE have the lowest jump rate. It should be noted that despite the rapid lithium-ion jump rates, the dipolar coupling interactions in CP experiments is not averaged out. This is because the motions of Li+ are not isotropic; instead, it follows restricted motion patterns, such as hopping between oxygen atoms along the polymer chain. One should treat these fitting results carefully due to the errors from numerical fitting, the uncertainties arising from peak deconvolution and possible chemical exchanges in the system (Fig. S6). However, more convincing evidence can be found from directly assessing the SLR curves in Fig. 3(c), which unambiguously show that moving towards higher temperatures, the SLR rates of the “PVCN-SPE (broad)” lithium component reach the maximum first, followed by “PVCN-SPE (narrow)” and “PVC-SPE”, sequentially. Given that the peak maxima correspond to the temperatures at which ω 0 τ c ≈ 1, where ω 0 is the 7Li Larmor frequency (ω 0/2π = 233.23 MHz in this case), the trend means that to reach the τ c ≈ 1/ω 0 condition, the highest temperature is required for “PVC” and the lowest for “PVCN-broad”; in other words, the mobility of Li ions follows as “PVCN-SPE (broad)” > “PVCN-SPE (narrow)” > “PVC-SPE”. These results suggest that the PEO chain segments primarily facilitate Li-ion conduction [34,47] within the PVCN-SPE, where the PEO segments form an amorphous separated structure by cross-linking with PVC. While the PVC segments may play limited role to this process given its weaker coordination strength to Li ions [15]. However, given the high dielectric constant of PVC segments, it is expected that they can assist in the dissociation of lithium salts, thereby generating a greater number of free Li ions [48]. Again, such clear differentiation of Li mobilities on different segments within a polymer may not be easily attained by typical electrochemical based methods. It is quite surprising that Li ions associated with the broad peak show higher mobility, as broad and narrow NMR peaks for metal ions in the polymer materials are usually signs of restricted and mobile characteristics, respectively. To have a better understanding, we further performed 7Li NMR experiments at different fields and MAS rates, and it is found that the line broadening can be significantly suppressed by increasing the field strength and MAS rate (see Fig. S7), suggesting that the broadening is mostly dipolar coupling based, e.g., 1H-7Li and 7Li-7Li dipole–dipole couplings. Therefore, it is undoubted that the broad signal accounts for Li ions more tightly bound to the PEO chain segments as the 1H-7Li HETCOR spectrum (Fig. 2c) has illustrated; however, this seems to contradict with the higher Li-ion mobility it exhibits. By comparing the molecular weights and molar ratios of PVC and PEO segments in the PVCN-SPE (according to the 13C NMR data in Fig. S1d), it can be estimated that approximately 14–20 PEO segments are grafted onto each PVC chain, or, on average, one PEO segment for every 10–14 VC units. Such a network structure could provide enough PEO chain segments to facilitate the dispersion of Li ions, but meanwhile prevents PEOs from crystallization, which may be the main reason for its overall promising ion conductivity. The PEO chains, on the other hand, when not crystallized, are highly mobile [49], and the PEO-tumbling could contribute additional motions to the Li ions, making its apparent mobility higher than the other Li ions. Three PVCN-SPEs with varied PVC and PEO segment ratios, i.e., PVC:PEO = 1.2:0.8, 1:1 and 0.8:1.2, are prepared and tested for electrochemical and mechanical performances, as shown in Table S3 and Fig. S8. It is apparent that the PVCN-SPE with “1:1” ratio leads to the highest ionic conductivity, which further supports the above conclusion. Consequently, we have proposed an ion-conduction pathway within the PVCN-SPE. Based on past research on PEO-SPE, it is widely recognized that PEO segments can form strong coordination structures with lithium ions. Moreover, lithium ions can rapidly 'hop' between different O sites and amorphous (typically achieved by increasing temperature) PEO segments facilitated by the tumbling motion of PEO segments, thereby enabling high ion migration [50]. In our system, we believe that this mechanism is still applicable. Lithium ions that strongly interact with PEO are marked in dark green in Scheme 2 , denoted “PEO-intrachain Li ions”. On the other hand, the rigid PVC segments may play a limited role in ion hopping and migration, given its much weaker coordinating strength to Li ions [15]. However, their high dielectric constant is beneficial for the dissociation of lithium salts, thus increasing the concentration of free lithium ions, which are marked in light green and denoted “PEO-interchain Li ions”. It is possible that the PEO-interchain Li ions can coordinate with O atoms on PEO to transform into PEO-intrachain Li ions, as evident from the narrow 7Li signals correlating with various 1H sites in the 1H-7Li HETCOR experiment in Fig. 2(b). Thanks to the suitable ratio of PEO to PVC, the PEO segments cannot form a crystalline structure, thus possessing great flexibility for random tumbling. This movement drives the rapid motion of PEO-intrachain Li ions, facilitating their hopping between different O sites and PEO segments, thus leading to the high ionic conductivity in the PVCN-SPE. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, our solid-state NMR experiments have provided a detailed understanding of the high lithium-ion conductivity mechanism in PVCN-SPE. Through high-field, ultra-fast MAS NMR and 2D correlation NMR spectroscopy, we successfully identified two distinct types of lithium ions in PVCN-SPE: PEO-intrachain and PEO-interchain Li ions. We have elucidated their specific interactions with different polymer chains, finding that PEO-intrachain Li ions demonstrate a stronger correlation with PEO chain segments. 7Li SLR measurements on these lithium ions in the PVCN-SPE context revealed that PEO-intrachain Li ions exhibit notably higher mobility, with a correlation rate of 8.98 × 107 Hz at 298 K. This study leads to the pivotal conclusion that cross-linking PVC and PEO chains with optimal lengths and ratios plays a crucial role in hindering PEO crystallization while providing ample room for PEO chains to tumble. Such a configuration facilitates the rapid migration of PEO-intrachain Li ions, enabling them to hop efficiently between various oxygen sites or across different PEO chains, thereby enhancing lithium-ion conductivity in PVCN-SPE. Cross-linking serves not only to enhance the mechanical properties of the electrolyte materials but also to potentially improve ionic conductivity, provided that the type, size, and proportion of polymers are selected appropriately. This insight opens up new avenues for the design of advanced electrolyte materials. Future research could focus on optimizing the cross-linking process to balance mechanical robustness with high ionic conductivity, exploring a wider range of polymer combinations and cross-linking agents.

        "dc:description": "Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have become increasingly important in advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their improved safety and mechanical properties compared to organic liquid electrolytes. Cross-linked polymers have the potential to further improve the mechanical property without trading off Li-ion conductivity. In this study, focusing on a recently developed cross-linked SPE, i.e., the one based on poly(vinylene carbonate)-poly(ethylene oxide) cross-linked network (PVCN), we used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate the fundamental interaction between the chain segments and Li ions, as well as the lithium-ion motion. By utilizing homonuclear/heteronuclear correlation, CP (cross-polarization) kinetics, and spin–lattice relaxation experiments, etc., we revealed the structural characteristics and their relations to lithium-ion mobilities. It is found that the network formation prevents poly(ethylene oxide) chains from crystallization, which could create sufficient space for segmental tumbling and Li-ion conduction. As such, the mechanical property is greatly improved with even higher Li-ion mobilities compared to the poly(vinylene carbonate) or poly(ethylene oxide) based SPE analogues.",
