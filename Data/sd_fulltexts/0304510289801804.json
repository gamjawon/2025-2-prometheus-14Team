As demonstrated by \"C and ^ NMR studies, the complexation equilibrium is displaced fully towards the formation of the complex. Under these circumstances, the amount of free external Lewis base (ELB) is much less than in other systems, with the result that ELB is better able to promote the activation of isotactic specific sites on the solid catalyst. Once active sites have been formed via interaction of free or complexed alkylaluminium with titanium, further addition of silane, up to a 1:1 ratio with Al, does not lead to poisoning of the sites. A very stable ternary complex is formed between the titanium site and the silane-complexed alkylaluminium. This complex is strongly attached to the catalyst and the exchange equilibrium between the adsorbed ELB-TEA complex and the external solution, which is quite fast when aromatic esters are used as an ELB, is very slow in this case so that high dilution of the solution or addition of further TEA has no effect on the behaviour of the catalyst. Finally, it has been shown that PTES works exclusively through its complex with TEA. Introduction Third generation Ziegler-Natta catalysts for olefin (and especially propene) polymerization, supported on MgClg, show definitely superior per- formances, with a result that there is a growing interest in understanding how they work. A recent review by Barbe et al. [1] has described the basic features of these catalysts and clearly distinguished the two kinds of Lewis bases associated with the components of the catalytic system. The so-called 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 157 external Lewis base is added to the solution surrounding the catalyst, together with alkylaluminium, and as a consequence a major improvement in the isotactic specificity of the catalytic system is observed. The internal Lewis base is introduced into the solid catalyst, being strongly associated with the MgClg support [2-5] and may also be complexed with TiCL [2, 6]; its introduction leads to a further improvement in both the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, the best performances observed to date have been with a special family of these catalysts, where a diester is included as the internal Lewis base (ILB) and a silane such as phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) as the external Lewis base (ELB). In a previous paper [7], we have described some of the special features of this family of catalysts, i.e. the possibility of using them at temperatures up to 80 C, the very large effect induced by small amounts of PTES on the activity and isotactic specificity of the catalytic system, and the high sensitivity of the latter to the strong activation effect of hydrogen. The purpose of the present paper is to describe further the very peculiar features associated with the use of silane as an ELB, and to discuss their implication on the mechanism of site activation. A recent paper by Soga et al. [8] is devoted to the very same question; however, the mechanistic suggestions advanced by these authors are not totally convincing since they fail to take into account the strong association we have observed between PTES and alkylaluminium. Experimental Catalyst preparation using dibutylphthalate as the internal Lewis base together with the propene polymerization conditions employed have been described previously [7]. The typical polymerization conditions used here are: slurry polymerization in a 11 magnetically stirred reactor; diluent, heptane; temperature, 70 C; cocatalyst, triethylaluminium (6mmoll~1); external Lewis base, phenyltriethoxysilane; total pressure (including < 0.1 bar hydro- gen), 4 bar; duration, 90 min. The polymer tacticity was estimated from the percentage of polymer insoluble in cold and hot heptane (2 h Kumagawa extraction) and is given as the heptane insoluble fraction (HI) in per cent. It has been found that Kumagawa extraction for 2 h is more efficient than Soxhiet extraction for 24 h. IR spectra have been recorded using a Nicolet 20 SX Fourier Transform spectrometer with a 2 cm\"1 resolution. \"C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 80 Fourier Transform spectrometer operat- ing at 20.1 MHz. The diluent used was deuterated cyclohexane. Results and discussion Interaction between PTES and triethylaluminium (TEA) The interaction between TEA and other alkylaluminiums, on the one hand, and several aromatic esters (such as ethyl benzoate, methyl, p-toluate 158 or ethyl anisate) on the other, is well documented [2,9-12]. In most cases, evidence was provided for the formation of a 1:1 complex and sometimes a 2:1 complex [11]. In the presence of excess TEA, these complexes are not very stable and reduction of the ester group to an aluminium alcoholate takes place. The reduction is accelerated by increasing temperature as well as an increase in the concentration of the components, but the presence of monomer slows the process down [11, 13]. The lack of stability of TEA-ELB complexes has been a severe drawback for the industrial development of the catalysts with aromatic esters included as ELBs. Similar complexation and reductions have been described recently by liskola et al. [ 14,15] for silanes; these authors indicated that in the presence of excess TEA, the 1:1 complex undergoes ether reduction with the formation of alkylated silyi ethers, i.e. silane and aluminium interchange alkoxy and alkyi groups, respectively. Such decomposition is not inhibited by 1-hexene at low hexene concentration, and is accelerated by increasing the temperature and the Al:Si ratio. However, it should be noted, that in order to reduce the data collection time to a reasonable value, these authors carried out their NMR experiments (\"C and ^Si) at concentrations lO^times higher than those used in the polymerization conditions described here (3 moll\"1 instead of 3mmoll-1). Our IR experiments were carried out in heptane at a concentration of 20nunoll-l with triethylaluminium or trihexylaluminium. The results ob- tained are the same with both cocatalysts and are presented for trihexylalu- minium. Typical IR spectra are shown in Fig. l(a) - (d) for Si:Al ratios of 0.13, 0.5, 1 and 1.33 respectively. By comparison with the spectrum of PTES alone [Fig. 2(a)], two new bands are observed at 885 and 1005 cm\"1; in addition, some modifications are observed regarding the PTES band corresponding to v(Si CHz) (963 cm~1) which is broadened, with a decrease in the v(Si 0 C) band at 1080 cm\" i and an increase in the band at 1105cm\"1 v(Si C of aromatic group). No changes were noted in the spectra when the systems were allowed to age at room temperature for 4 h. Although the variations in the PTES bands are not very important, they suggest that the equilibrium is strongly displaced towards the formation of a 1:1 complex. It is reasonable to believe, as suggested by liskola et al. [14], that formation of the complex involves the oxygen atom of an ethoxy group of PTES. However, it is not possible to assign with any certainty the two new bands observed. The effect of temperature has also been studied by IR spectroscopy (at 20 mmol 1~1 THA); thus, on heating at 60 C, no further change in the infrared spectra was noted even after 4 h. When ethanol was added to the system, the new bands at 885 and 1005 cm\"! progressively diminished in intensity and virtually disappeared when the ethanoLTHA ratio was equal to 1 [Fig. 2(b) - (d)]. Hence, it may be concluded that these bands are associated with the 1:1 complex and not with any reaction product between THA and PTES. iH NMR experiments undertaken at 80 MHz did not give rise to useful data, the shifts observed being quite small. Better results were obtained from \"C NMR spectroscopy at a TEA concentration of 0.5 moll\"1.

Fig. 3, when the Al:Si ratio was greater than 1, no change in the chemical shifts associated with the various carbon atoms of PTES was observed; when PTES was fully complexed with TEA, linear variations of the chemical shift with the PTES:TEA ratio were observed in the presence of excess PTES. Similar results are shown in Fig. 4 relating to the chemical shifts associated with the carbon atoms of the TEA ethyl group; these are fully complexed in the presence of excess PTES, and again exhibit linear variations in the chemical shift but in the reverse direction from that depicted in Fig. 3. From these results, it is clear that a 1:1 complex is formed and that the equilibrium is fully displaced towards the formation of the complex. Even with a fourfold excess of TEA, only one \"C resonance could be associated with each carbon atom of each species, i.e. no evidence for the formation of an alkylated silane 160 iZOO 1100 1000 900 800 (a) WAVENUMBER (cirr'l 1100 1025 9SO 875 (b) WAVENUMBER (cm-') ZLO ^ c _ 0 m o C M (0 --in S^ a: -, a in CQ <r (\\J (D (c) 1D25 2SO 875 WAVENUMBER (cm\"') 800 1 100 (d) 1025 950 875 WAVENUMBER (crrr'l Fig. 2.

Hence, the TEA-PTES complex is stable at room temperature at quite high concentrations (a result which may indicate some difference between PTES and the phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS) studied by liskola). A major consequence of the improved stability of the silane-TEA complex is that it can be used safely at higher temperatures than aromatic ester/TEA systems. Indeed, as already mentioned [7], the best results in propene polymerization with this complex were obtained at ca. 75 C. Accord- ing to liskola, only the final product of the reaction between PTMS and TEA, i.e. a dialkylated methoxysilane/TEA complex, was stable at that tempera- ture. However, as shown by the data listed in Table 1, the exact nature of the silane employed is not critical, unless a very high steric hindrance is 161 Fig. 3. \"C NMR data relating to the phenyltriethoxysilane carbons in the triethylaluminium- phenyltriethoxysilane complex at compositions varying from pure TEA (A) to pure PTES (B).

Interaction between cocatalyst and catalyst: third generation catalyst In accordance with our previous suggestions [4,16,17], the active cen- tres of the third generation catalyst (aromatic ester as ILB and ELB) are associated in a bimetallic system in which the alkylaluminium cocatalyst is bound reversibly to the active titanium. The presence of the cocatalyst is not only necessary in order to alkylate the titanium and thus create the initial Ti C bond, but an alkylaluminium (AA) must also be present throughout the polymerization in order to maintain the activity of the catalyst. The equilibrium involved in the formation of the active centres is displaced more or less towards the active species; indeed, on occasions (for example, with isoprenylaluminium) such displacement is quite considerable, especially when a cocatalyst with more than one Al atom in the molecule is employed [16]. The control of stereospecificity (by the cocatalyst solution) does not arise as a result of uncomplexed external Lewis base being present in the system (as would be the case if selective poisoning of aspecific centres occurred), but rather from competition between free AA and AA complexed to the ELB. Active centres formed from free AA are either specific or not, whereas active centres generated from complexed AA are specifically isotactic. The tacticity depends on the Ahester ratio over a wide range of concentrations, but not directly on the ester concentration. With third generation catalysts, the control of stereospecificity always remains reversible; addition of AA or aromatic ester to the cocatalyst solution during polymerization changes the Al:ester ratio as well as the Al:Ti or ELB:Ti ratios, although the latter always remain substantially above 1. Because of the new polymerization conditions involved, an adjustment oc- curs in the kinetic behaviour of the system and in the selectivity [17]. However, no difference in the behaviour was observed when the aromatic ester was complexed with TEA in a 1:1 ratio (ethyl anisate), in a 1:2 ratio (ethyl benzoate) or in a 1:1 and 1:2 mixture (methyl p-toluate) [18,19]. In these three different cases, the concentration of free aromatic ester would either be sensitive to the aluminium concentration (1:2 complex) or not (1:1 complex) [18]. 163 System involving silane as an external Lewis base Important differences with the third generation catalyst are observed with the new catalytic system using silane as an ELB; low concentrations of silane and/or high ALsilane ratios (between 10 and 40) are capable of improving the stereospecificity to values in excess of 95%. The detailed results obtained are presented in Table 2. Over the AA concentration range used (1-24 mmol 1~1), the catalyst remains isotactic specific even for an Al:Si ratio of 20 or less. For Al:Si =40, an aluminium concentration of 10 mmol 1~1 is necessary to achieve high selectivity. For Al:Si = 80, the required concentra- tion is 24 mmol I'1. Both the initial activity, as well as the productivity, of the catalyst increases up to a maximum as the silane concentration is increased up to an Al:Si ratio of ca. 20, and then decreases [7]. The same effect was observed with the third generation catalyst at a lower ALester ratio [18]. Interaction between the active centres and the external Lewis base involves much more complicated phenomena than simple poisoning. In an attempt to understand these phenomena, we have undertaken a series of experiments in which the behaviour of the combined system has been isolated from that of the third generation catalyst with a view to establishing how the catalyst activity and selectivity are controlled by the AA and silane concen- tration in the system. The interaction of the ELB with the active centre has already been clearly demonstrated [20]; when first contacted with the silane-AA mixture, in the absence of monomer the catalyst behaves in an isotactic-specific manner even if only AA is present in the polymerization medium. Up to 2% w/w of silicon remains bound to the solid support after such pretreatment, which also leads to extraction of the phthalate present on the solid. This means that the active and stereospecific catalyst used in the polymerization step is quite often virtually free from phthalate. In order to see how the tacticity may be controlled by the cocatalyst, two simple experiments were carried out. In the first, whose results are TABLE 2 Effect of Al:Si ratio and silane concentration on stereospecificity Experiment Al:Si ratio AA concn.

The experimental TEA:PTES = 20:1 =10:1. In all cases, presented in Fig. 5, polymerization commenced under the conditions Al:Si = 20:1 and [Al] = 3 mmol 1~\\ giving a heptane insoluble index of 96.5% and generating an isotactic polymer. After 22 min, AA was added to the system to yield Al:Si =40:1 and [Al] =6mmoll~1. In order to obtain more polymer during this second stage, a small amount of hydrogen was also added at the same time (0.05 bar) [7]. The heptane insoluble fraction now produced, as estimated by a separate experiment, was 71%. It is also possible to calculate the heptane insoluble fraction from the tacticity of the overall polymer; a value of 94.6% can thus be calculated for the second stage, representing 78wt.% of the overall polymer. The active centres formed during the first stage of the experiment remained isotactic even when the composition of the medium was changed. Rapid equilibration between the catalyst surface and the surrounding solution does not occur, and the silane is not extracted at higher AA concentrations. The results depicted in Fig. 6 illustrate the effect of silane addition during polymerization. After an initial polymerization stage without silane 4000 3000- 2000- 1000- 50 TIME (miri) Fig. 6.

In contrast to the previous experiment, the tacticity obtained during the second step in this experiment (96.8%) is very close to that expected. Under the circumstances employed, equilibration is now very rapid with the silane being transferred instantaneously to the catalyst surface. Hence, with the new catalytic system described in this work, the isotactic specificity may be increased rather than decreased by changes in the composition of the cocatalyst solution. This behaviour is quite different from that observed when the catalyst is contacted by an external solution contain- ing the third generation catalyst. Non-poisoning of isotactic specific centres by silane This may be demonstrated by undertaking experiments at atmospheric pressure employing an initial ALsilane ratio of 10:1. Phenyltriethoxysilane was added in two steps; in the first the Al:Si ratio was reduced to 3:1 and in the second a further reduction of the ratio to 1:1 was effected. The results depicted in Fig. 7 indicate that such variations in the Al:Si ratio have no effect upon the course and rate of the polymerization reaction. When contacted directly with the cocatalytic mixture at a ratio of 1, the catalyst proved to be totally inactive. Hence, it appears that silane quite clearly does not poison the isotactic-specific active centres, once these have been formed. On decreasing the Al:Si ratio, the activity increases to a maximum; the decrease in activity observed at high ELB concentration corresponds to inhibition of active centre formation, whereas the increase in activity at low ELB concentration may be associated with an increase in isotactic specifi- city. The highest isotactic specificity is also associated with an increase in molecular weight, which was observed both with the third generation 200 1 50 0> 1 00 0. 0. 0) ^ 50 A B C V SO 120 IBO TIME (min) Fig. 7.

This probably arises from an increase in the propagation constant associated with the isotactic specificity of the active centres. The effect of ELB is thus to convert low activity aspecific sites which produce low molecular weight atactic polymers into more active isotactic-specific sites. Thus, the activity increases with addition of ELB up to the point at which the concentration is sufficient to inhibit active centre formation. Stability of active complex Catalyst activity and selectivity are sensitive to the equilibria existing between the cocatalyst solution and the solid support. Having demonstrated the effect of silane or AA addition on the selectivity of the catalyst, let us next examine how the composition of the cocatalyst solution influences the activity and selectivity of the system. Changes in composition may result either from dilution of the system with pure diluent, or by washing and replacing the cocatalyst. Hence, it should be possible to establish how the silane binds to the solid support, and how it can be displaced from it. Dilution of cocatalyst solution The stability of the active complex is much greater in the new system described here than with the third generation catalysts previously available. Figure 8 illustrates the results obtained when attempts were made to displace the active Ti-Al complex by dilution. At the start of the experiment, polymer- ization commenced under conditions which gave rise to isotactic-specific polymerization (heptane insoluble fraction, 96.8%). After 35min, the poly- merization medium (100ml) was then diluted by the addition of 700ml heptane. However, the activity remained unchanged by this process and the heptane insoluble fraction obtained during this second stage was >94%. An entirely different behaviour was observed with the third generation catalyst; in that case, after dilution, the activity vanished after a few minutes [16]. 2000 g 1500 0) \\ SL 1000- a: 500- TER-2 mM/L TEB- 0.25 mM/L 60 TIME (min) 90 Fig. 8.

The experimen- tal points indicated as * correspond to [TEA] = 2 mmol 1~1 and [PTES] = 0.25 mmol I-1, whereas those indicated as correspond to [TEA] = 0,25 mmol I-1 and [PTES] =0.025 mmol I-1. In all cases, temp. = 70 C; diluent, heptane; total pressure, 4 bar. 167 Washing and replacing cocatalyst The results of the experiments conducted in this case are summarized in Table 3. In experiment 1, silane was introduced as a second ILB during catalyst preparation simultaneously with dibutylphthalate. In the absence of ELB, the catalyst was active but not stereospecific, despite having a silane content (1.6% w/w) equal to that present on isotactic-specific catalysts when silane was introduced as part of the cocatalyst [20]. Hence the presence of silane solely as an ILB has no significant effect on isotactic specificity. In experiment 2A, the catalyst was first contacted with TEA alone (6.5 mmol 1~1; 60 C; 10 min) in order to alkylate and perhaps reduce Ti^ to Ti111, then washed with heptane and finally contacted with PTES (0.6 mmol 1~1 in heptane; 60 C; 10 min). The resulting solid was used as a catalyst with TEA (6Inmoll-l) being the cocatalyst. The selectivity again remains poor (75%) in this case. In contrast, when the catalyst was succes- sively treated with TEA and PTES without intermediate washing (experi- ment 3), the stereoselectivity was improved substantially (heptane insoluble fraction = 93%). Silane binds efficiently to the catalyst in the presence of AA, but if alkylaluminium has been eliminated from the solid by washing, no activity is observed if too low an AA concentration is used in the cocatalyst (experiment 2B). Experiment 3B demonstrates that at AA concentrations higher than those employed in experiment 3A, stereospecificity of the catalyst diminishes.

In this ease the catalyst was contacted with a mixture of TEA and PTES ([TEA] =6mmoH-1; [PTES] =0.6mmoll-1; 20 C; 30min). The resulting solid was separated by filtration and used when the polymeriza- tion was conducted with TEA alone ([TEA] =0.4mmoll~1). The resulting system proved quite isotactic-specific. Finally, in the last experiment quoted in Table 3, the catalyst was treated in a similar manner to that employed in experiment 4A and then used with a very low cocatalyst concentration. No activity was observed even when the conditions of the pretreatment were changed in favour of the formation of active centres ([TEA] = 66 nunol I-1; [PTES] = 20 mmol I-1). These experiments all demonstrate that alkylaluminium must be present at a greater concentration than 0.1 mol 1~1 in order to generate any activity. Even if the active centres are preformed, too low a concentration of cocata- lyst leads to deactivation. Similar observations were made with third genera- tion catalysts, but such systems were more sensitive to the concentration of the medium. The observed behaviour favours a bimetallic nature for the active sites. Although silane interacts with the catalyst, the stereospecificity is only enhanced when silane is used in the presence of AA or added after contact with AA. No isotactic-specific active centres are present under any other circumstances. They are either totally destroyed by too great a dis- placement of the equilibrium (experiments 2B and 4B) or are partly displaced (experiment 4A) or not even formed (experiment 2A). Conclusions Active centre formation and catalyst selectivity are controlled by the cocatalyst via a series of equilibria between its solution and the solid support. Phenyltriethoxy silane forms a 1:1 complex with triethylaluminium via an equilibrium which is displaced so far towards the complex that the amount of free silane in solution is undetectable. Although silane is not a poison of active centres already formed, it inhibits the formation of further active centres. As for third generation catalysts employing eaters as ELBs, free and silane-complexed AA compete in the formation of active centres which seem to consist of bimetallic Ti-Al complexes. With the new catalysts described in this work, the fact that stereospecificity is obtained at a higher A1:ELB ratio indicates that the equilibria involved in active centre formation are displaced towards the formation of isotactic-specific centres. The stability of the active complex is much higher with these new systems, but can be destroyed simply by washing with heptane or by contact with very dilute AA cocatalyst solutions. The catalysts described here differ essentially from the third generation catalysts in the stability of the active isotactic-specific complexes present. The relation between catalyst preparation and the observed changes in properties will be the subject of a forthcoming paper. 169 Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to ATOCHEM Groupe Elf Aquitaine for support and help.

As demonstrated by 13C and 1 NMR studies, the complexation equilibrium is displaced fully towards the formation of the complex. Under these circumstances, the amount of free external Lewis base (ELB) is much less than in other systems, with the result that ELB is better able to promote the activation of isotactic specific sites on the solid catalyst. Once active sites have been formed via interaction of free or complexed alkylaluminium with titanium, further addition of silane, up to a 1:1 ratio with Al, does not lead to poisoning of the sites. A very stable ternary complex is formed between the titanium site and the silane-complexed alkylaluminium. This complex is strongly attached to the catalyst and the exchange equilibrium between the adsorbed ELB-TEA complex and the external solution, which is quite fast when aromatic esters are used as an ELB, is very slow in this case so that high dilution of the solution or addition of further TEA has no effect on the behaviour of the catalyst. Finally, it has been shown that PTES works exclusively through its complex with TEA. References 1 P.C. Barbé G. Cecchin L. Noristi Adv. Polym. Sci. 81 1987 1 2 M. Giannini G. Giunchi E.A.
