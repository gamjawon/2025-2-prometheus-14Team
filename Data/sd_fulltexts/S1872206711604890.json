The catalysts were characterized using Xâ€�ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, Xâ€�ray fluorescence, atomic absorption specâ€� troscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the Mn existed as Mn3O4 on the Ru surface. The Mn3O4 reacted with ZnSO4 to form an insoluble [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt, which was readily chemisorbed on the Ru surface. This chemisorbed salt played a key role in imâ€� proving the cyclohexene selectivity over the Ru catalyst. The cyclohexene yield of 61.3% was obâ€� tained over the Ruâ€�Mn catalyst with the optimum Mn content of 5.4%. This catalyst had good stabilâ€� ity and excellent reusability.

Keywords: Benzene Selective hydrogenation Cyclohexene Ruthenium Manganese Zirconia Zinc Â 1. Introduction The production of nylonâ€�6 and nylonâ€�66 from benzene and cyclohexene has attracted much attention because it is a safe, environmentally benign, and atomic economic process [1â€“4]. Hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene is thermodynamiâ€� cally favored [5]. The development of a catalyst with high cyâ€� clohexene selectivity in the hydrogenation of benzene is thereâ€� fore important for this technology. Second metals or metal oxides could significantly improve the cyclohexene selectivities and yields of Ruâ€�based catalysts. Xie et al. [6] prepared an Ruâ€�B/SiO2 catalyst by impregnation and chemical reduction methods, and found that the activity and cyclohexene selectivity of this catalyst in H2 reduction of benzene were better than those of an Ru/SiO2 catalyst with the same Ru loading. They also revealed that the B was present in two forms, namely oxidized and elemental B species, and modiâ€� fication of their hydrophilicities on the surface of the Ruâ€�B/SiO2 catalyst gave this catalyst high activity and high cyclohexene selectivity. Liu et al. [7] prepared an Ruâ€�Laâ€�B/ZrO2 catalyst using a chemical reduction method and obtained a cyclohexene yield of 53.2% and a corresponding cyclohexene selectivity of 61.9%. They confirmed that the La in this catalyst existed as La2O3. Fan et al. [8] prepared an Ruâ€�Coâ€�B/Î³â€�Al2O3 catalyst using an impregnation reduction method, and achieved a cyclohexâ€� ene yield of 28.8% without any additives. They discovered that the Co in this catalyst was present as an oxide. Liu et al. [9] prepared an Ruâ€�Ce/SBAâ€�15 catalyst using a â€œtwoâ€�solventâ€� imâ€� * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 4, April 2013 SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 684â€“694 Â pregnation method and achieved a cyclohexene yield of 53.8% over the catalyst with an optimum Ce/Ru molar ratio of 0.25. They found that the Ce existed as a Ce(â…¢) species. These studies provide a good basis for the development of catalysts and cataâ€� lytic systems for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. In previous work, we developed nanoâ€�amorphous Ruâ€�Mâ€�B/ZrO2 (M = Zn, Co, Fe, La) catalysts with Ru loadings less than oneâ€�third those of industrial Ruâ€�Zn catalysts and obâ€� tained a cyclohexene selectivity of 78.8% at a benzene converâ€� sion of 59.6%. This was much better than the cyclohexene seâ€� lectivity of 80% at a benzene conversion of 40% obtained over industrial Ruâ€�Zn catalysts [10â€“12]. We developed monolayer dispersed Ruâ€�Siâ€�M (M = Zn, Mn, Fe, Ce, La) catalysts and achieved a cyclohexene selectivity of 80% at a benzene converâ€� sion of 60%. The catalysts were used in a commercial unit and were shown to be economical, safe, and environmentally friendly. We have applied for national patents for these cataâ€� lysts [13,14]. In this work, we prepared a series of Ruâ€�Mn cataâ€� lysts with different Mn contents, investigated the influence of different Mn contents on the performance of the Ru catalysts in selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene, and deterâ€� mined the role of the Mn promoter. The stability and reusabilâ€� ity of the Ruâ€�Mn/ZrO2 catalyst with an optimum Mn content of 5.4% were also investigated. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation RuCl3Â·H2O (9.75 g) and the desired amount of MnSO4Â·H2O were dissolved in 200 ml of H2O with agitation. A 10% NaOH solution was added to the stirred solution. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was filtrated and the black precipiâ€� tate was washed three times with distilled water. This black precipitate was then dispersed in 400 ml of a 5% NaOH soluâ€� tion and charged in a 1â€�L Teflonâ€�lined autoclave. The reduction conditions were as follows: H2 pressure 5 MPa, temperature 150 Â°C, stirring rate 800 r/min, and time 3 h. The obtained black powder was washed with distilled water until neutrality was achieved, and subsequently vacuumâ€�dried, giving the deâ€� sired Ruâ€�Mn catalyst. The catalyst was divided into two porâ€� tions. One portion was used for activity tests and the other was used for catalyst characterization. This ensured the catalysts with different Mn contents had the same Ru contents. The amounts of MnSO4Â·H2O were adjusted to give catalysts with different Mn contents, denoted by Ruâ€�Mn(x), where x denotes the weight percentage of Mn in the catalyst, determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Ruâ€�Mn catalysts prepared using different Mn precursors were obtained according to the above procedure, except that MnSO4Â·H2O was replaced by equal molar amounts of Mn(NO3)2 or MnCl2. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The weight percentages of Mn and the concentration of Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ were analyzed by inductively coupled plasâ€� maâ€�atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPâ€�AES) on an ICAT 6000 SERIES instrument of Heme Electron corporation. Xâ€�ray difâ€� fraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a PANalytcal Xâ€²Pert PRO instrument with Cu KÎ± (Î» = 0.1541 nm) radiation and a scan range of 2Î¸ = 5Â°â€“90Â° in steps of 0.03Â°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL JEMâ€�2100 instrument. N2 physisorption (Brunauâ€� erâ€�Emmettâ€�Teller method) was determined using a Quantachrome Nova 100e apparatus. The compositions of the catalysts were determined by Xâ€�ray fluorescence (XRF), using a Bruker S4 Pioneer instrument. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) of the Zn LMM transitions was performed using a ULVAC PHIâ€�700 nanoscanning Auger system with an onâ€�axis scanning Arâ€�ion gun and a cylindrical mirror energy analyzer. The enerâ€� gy resolution was 0.1%. The background pressure of the analyâ€� sis room was less than 5.2 Ã— 10 âˆ’7 Pa. The standard sample was SiO2/Si. 2.3. Activity tests The selective hydrogenation of benzene was performed in a 1â€�L Hastelloyâ€�lined autoclave. A sample of Ruâ€�Mn catalyst, 9.8 g of ZrO2, and 49.2 g of ZnSO4 were charged in the autoclave. Heating was begun with an H2 pressure of 5 MPa and a stirring rate of 800 r/min. Benzene (140 ml) was fed into the system and the stirring rate was increased to 1400 r/min to prevent diffusion effects when the temperature reached 150 Â°C. The reaction process was monitored by taking small samples of the reaction mixture every 5 min. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a GCâ€�1690 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (Hangzhou Kexiao Instrument Co., China). The benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were calculated from the product concentration obtained using corrected peak area normalization. At the end of the reaction, the organic phase was removed using a separating funnel. The slurry containing the mixture of the catalyst and ZrO2 was reâ€� used, according to the above operations, without any additions. The catalysts after hydrogenation were denoted by Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2, where x is the weight percentage of Mn in the catalyst, determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst without the addition of ZrO2 after hyâ€� drogenation was denoted by Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) AH, where AH repâ€� resents after hydrogenation. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst characterization results Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts and the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts with ZrO2 as a dispersant after hyâ€� drogenation. Figure 1(a) shows that all the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts display the diffraction peaks of the hexagonal phases of metallic Ru (JCPDS 01â€�070â€�0274) at 2Î¸ = 38.5Â°, 42.3Â°, 44.0Â°, 58.3Â°, 69.2Â°, 78.4Â°, and 38.5Â°. The Ruâ€�Mn(8.0%) and Ruâ€�Mn(10.8%) cataâ€� lysts show the diffraction peaks of Mn3O4 (JCPDS 00â€�001â€�1127) at 2Î¸ = 18.0Â°, 32.7Â°, 36.1Â°, 58.9Â°, and 69.3Â°. Morales et al. [15] confirmed that the Mn in a Coâ€�Mn/TiO2 catalyst reduced below SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 684â€“694 Â 300 Â°C existed as Mn3O4. The reduction temperature was only 150 Â°C. These results prompted us to suggest that the Mn in the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts was mainly present as Mn3O4. When the Mn contents were in the range 3.4%â€“5.4%, the diffraction peaks of Mn3O4 were not observed in the XRD patterns of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts as a result of the low amounts and small crystallites of Mn3O4. Table 1 presents the Ru crystallite sizes of the catalysts calâ€� culated from the strongest peak broadening at 2Î¸ = 44Â° using the Scherrer equation. As can be seen, the Ru crystallite sizes of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts were distributed in the narrow range 3.7â€“4.5 nm, indicating that the introduction of Mn3O4 had little effect on the Ru crystallite sizes. Figure 1(b) shows that all the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 catalysts after hydrogenation have the weak diffraction peaks of metallic Ru at 2Î¸ = 44.0Â°, indicating small Ru crystallite sizes.

TEM images (a, b) and Ru crystallite size distributions (c, d) of Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) and Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%)/ZrO2.Â SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 684â€“694 Â diffraction peaks corresponded to the monoclinic phases of ZrO2 (JCPDS 00â€�024â€�1165). Figure 1(c) shows that the Ruâ€�Zn(5.4%) catalyst without the addition of ZrO2 after hydroâ€� genation displayed not only the diffraction peaks of metallic Ru but also the diffraction peaks of the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt (JCPDS 01â€�078â€�0247). This indicated that the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt had formed on the surface of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst after hydrogenation in the presence of ZnSO4. However, the diffraction peaks of this salt were not obâ€� served on the surface of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts after hydroâ€� genation with the addition of ZrO2, suggesting that this salt was highly dispersed on the surface of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts and the ZrO2 dispersant. Xie et al. [16] confirmed that many salts could spontaneously disperse on the support surfaces. Figure 2 shows the TEM images of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst and the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst after hydrogenation, with ZrO2 as a dispersant, and the corresponding Ru crystallite size disâ€� tributions. Figure 2(a) shows that the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst consisted of nanoscale spherical and ellipsoidal Ru crystallites. Figure 2(c) shows that the Ru crystalite size of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst was concentrated at around 4.8 nm, which was consistent with the XRD results. Figure 2 shows that the ZrO2 dispersant mainly consisted of ZrO2 crystallites of size about 20 nm. The catalyst particles were separated and isolatâ€� ed by ZrO2 after the first hydrogenation, indicating that a suitaâ€� ble amount of ZrO2 could significantly suppress agglomeration, which could have occurred as a result of collisions among difâ€� ferent catalyst particles under high agitation [17]. Figure 2(d) shows that the Ru crystallite sizes of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%)/ZrO2 catalyst after hydrogenation were mainly distributed at around 4.5 nm, which is much smaller than the crystallites of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst before hydrogenation. This indicated that the ZrO2 played an important role in dispersing the cataâ€� lyst particles. Table 1 shows the textural properties of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) cataâ€� lysts. As can be seen, the surface areas, pore volumes, and pore diameters generally decreased with the Mn content of the catâ€� alysts. Zhang et al. [18] found that the specific surface area of a Coâ€�Mn/TiO2 catalyst was less than that of TiO2, and they sugâ€� gested that amorphous MnO x was dispersed on the TiO2 surface and blocked some of the catalyst pores. Similarly, it is proposed that Mn3O4 was dispersed on the surface of the catalysts and could block some of the catalyst pores, resulting in decreases in the surface areas, pore volumes, and pore diameters. The texâ€� tural properties of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts after hydrogenation were similar to that of ZrO2 because the mass ratio of ZrO2 to catalyst was 5:1 [19]. N2 physisorption studies of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 after hydrogenation were therefore not necesâ€� sary. Table 2 shows the compositions of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 and Ruâ€�Mn(x) AH, the concentrations of metallic ions in the aqueâ€� ous phase, and the pH values of the aqueous phase at room temperature. The Mn/Ru, Zn/Ru, and Zr/Ru atomic ratios clearly reflect the variations in the catalyst compositions before and after hydrogenation. Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts with different Mn contents were prepared using MnSO4Â·H2O as the precursor. As can be seen from Table 2, the molar ratios of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 catalysts after hydrogenation were all 0.02, indicating trace amounts of Mn in the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 after hydrogenation. The Zn/Ru atomic ratios of Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 after hydrogenation increased, and the concentrations of Mn 2+ in the aqueous phase increased and the concentrations of Zn 2+ decreased with Mn content. In particular, the colorless slurries after hydrogenation prompted us to propose that the Mn in the slurries existed as Mn 2+ . All of these results indicated that the Mn3O4 on the surfaces of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts had reacted with ZnSO4 to form a new Zn species and an Mn(â…¡) species. The Zn species were chemisorbed on the Ru surfaces and the Mn(â…¡) species were dissolved in the slurries. A trace amount of Mn was also detectable in the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst without the addition of ZrO2 after hydrogenation. Its Zn/Ru molar ratio was similar to that with ZrO2. It was also found that the S/Ru molar ratio for the catalyst without ZrO2 was 0.06, which was conâ€� sistent with the XRD results, and showed that the Zn species existed as the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt. The addition of ZrO2 lowered the S contents of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts after hydrogenation to below the detection limit of the XRF instruâ€� ment. All these results implied that the Zn species existed as the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt. The amount of [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt increased with the Mn3O4 conâ€� tent, which resulted in an increase in the Zn/Ru atomic ratio. It was concluded that the Mn3O4 was mainly present on the Ru surface because the ZnSO4 in the slurry could only react with Mn3O4 on the Ru surface, i.e., the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt formed could only be chemisorbed on the Ru surface.

More Mn3O4 reacted with more ZnSO4 to form the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt, resulting in a decrease in the Zn 2+ concentrations. The degree of hydrolysis of ZnSO4 thereâ€� fore decreased and the pH values of the aqueous solutions inâ€� creased. The molar ratios of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 catalysts after hydrogenation were stable, at around 5.00, as a result of the fixed amounts of ZrO2. Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts were prepared from different precurâ€� sors, namely MnSO4, Mn(NO3)2, and MnCl2, in equimolar quanâ€� tities. The Mn mass percentages in the catalysts, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, were 5.4%, 5.2%, and 5.6%, respectively. Table 2 shows that the Mn/Ru, Zn/Ru, and Zr/Ru atomic ratios of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 catalysts after hydrogenaâ€� tion were similar, indicating similar chemical compositions of the Ruâ€�Mn(x)/ZrO2 catalysts after hydrogenation. The Zn(II) species chemisorbed on the Ru surface played an important role in improving the cyclohexene selectivities of the Ru catalysts [20â€“23]. However, there are different opinions about the Zn valence. Wang et al. [20] characterized Ruâ€�Zn/mâ€�ZrO2 catalysts using XPS and found that the Zn 2p3/2 binding energy (BE) of the Zn in the catalyst was close to that of metallic Zn. They suggested that chemisorbed Zn 2+ cations could be reduced to metallic Zn by the hydrogen atoms that spilled from the surface of the Ru catalyst. Yuan et al. [21] and He et al. [22] also indicated that Zn atoms could be introduced into Ruâ€�based catalysts by the reduction of Zn 2+ , based on XPS results. However, Struijk et al. [24] indicated that the Zn 2+ in the adsorption of ZnSO4 could not be reduced on the surface of an Ru catalyst, also on the basis of XPS results. An important reason for such differences is the closeness of the Zn 2p3/2 BEs corresponding to Zn(II) and metallic Zn. It is therefore very difficult to assess the valences of Zn based on the Zn 2p3/2 BEs [25]. This drawback can be overcome by using the Zn LMM Auger transition, as the Auger shift between Zn(II) and metallic Zn is higher than 4.6 eV [26]. Figure 3 shows the AES Zn LMM spectra of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst with ZrO2 after hydroâ€� genation. The spectra were recorded after Ar + sputtering for 1 min to avoid interruptions of the surface oxidation of the cataâ€� lyst. As can be seen, the kinetic energy of Zn LMM for Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%)/ZrO2 after hydrogenation was 984.2 eV, which was in agreement with that of Zn(II) species [27,28]. This was also consistent with the XRD result that the Zn species existed as the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt. This also indicates that the Zn species chemisorbed on the Ru surface were still present as Zn 2+ even under reaction conditions of 150 Â°C and an H2 presâ€� sure of 5.0 MPa. The AES measurements did not identify any additional contributions from metallic Zn (commonly appearâ€� ing in the 991â€“995 eV range), indicating that the Zn 2+ chemiâ€� sorbed on the Ru surface could not be reduced to metallic Zn. The results in Table 2 show that the aqueous solutions after hydrogenation at room temperature were acidic, as a result of the hydrolysis of ZnSO4. It is well known that higher temperaâ€� tures favor hydrolysis. This means that the acidity of the liquid phase is much higher at a reaction temperature of 150 Â°C as a result of the increase in the degree of hydrolysis of ZnSO4. As is known, it is difficult for metallic Zn to exist in acidic solutions, and this is consistent with there being no clear evidence in the AES results of the presence of metallic Zn on the surface of the Ru catalysts. 975 980 985 990 995 1000 I n t e n s i t y Kinetic energy (eV) 984.2 Fig. 3.

The Mn3O4 reacted with ZnSO4 to form the [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt in the hydroâ€� genation process. This salt could be readily chemisorbed on the Ru surface and directly affected the performance of the Ru catâ€� alyst in the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. 3.2. Performances of Ruâ€�Zn(x) catalysts in selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene Figure 4 shows the performances of Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts with different Mn contents, using ZrO2 as a dispersant, for the selecâ€� tive hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. As can be seen from Fig. 4(a) and (b), the catalytic activity increased and the cyclohexene selectivity at the same benzene conversion deâ€� creased with Mn content of the catalyst. Obviously, the increase in cyclohexene selectivity was achieved at the expense of cataâ€� lytic activity. As can be seen from Fig. 4(c), the cyclohexene yields continuously increased when the Mn content of the catâ€� alyst increased from 3.4% to 5.4%. However, with further inâ€� creases in the Mn content, the cyclohexene yields increased gradually. The Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst gave a cyclohexene yield of 61.3%, which is among the best results reported so far [9,29]. It should also be noted that the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst without ZrO2 gave a cyclohexene selectivity of 82.7% at a benâ€� zene conversion of 59.4% at 15 min. The activity was lower (64.4%) and the cyclohexene selectivity was slightly higher (80.7%) than those with ZrO2. This implied that the ZrO2 played an important role in dispersing the Ru catalyst particles; this is consistent with the TEM results. The results described above show that the amount of [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt formed in the hydrogenation process increased with the Mn3O4 content of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catâ€� alysts. The chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt played a key role in improving the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru catâ€� alyst. (1) The chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt was rich in crystallization water. Chemisorption of the salt on the surface of the catalyst therefore resulted in the Ru catalyst beâ€� ing surrounded by a stagnant water layer. The existence of a stagnant water layer on the catalyst surface could accelerate desorption and hinder reâ€�adsorption of cyclohexene for further hydrogenation to cyclohexane [13,30]. (2) The Zn 2+ of the chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt could selectively cover most reactive sites of the catalyst, which could reduce the adsorption enthalpies of cyclohexene and benzene. A decrease in the adsorption enthalpy of cyclohexene could result in an increase in the cyclohexene desorption rate, and hence an inâ€� crease in the cyclohexene selectivity. However, a decrease in the adsorption enthalpy of benzene would lead to a decrease in the catalytic activity [24,30]. (3) Electronic interactions beâ€� tween Zn 2+ of the chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt and the active Ru components could modify the electronic structure of Ru, which might be favorable for the formation of cyclohexene [13,20,30]. (3) The Zn 2+ of the chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt could form loosely bound adâ€� ducts with cyclohexene, which could stabilize the cyclohexene formed on the surface of the Ru catalyst and improve the cyâ€� clohexene selectivity [9,20,29]. The activities of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts therefore decreased and the cyclohexene selectivities increased with increasing amounts of chemisorbed [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt.

Figure 5 shows the performances of the Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts prepared using different precursors, with ZrO2 as a dispersant, for selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene. As can be seen, the activities, the cyclohexene selectivities, and the cyclohexene yields of these catalysts were all very similar. The characterization results confirmed that these catalysts had similar chemical compositions. This could be responsible for the very similar performances of these catalysts. The results also suggest that the SO4 2âˆ’ , NO3 âˆ’ , and Cl âˆ’ ions of the Mn preâ€� cursors had little effect on the performances of these catalysts. Figure 6 shows the reusability of the Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%) catalyst with ZrO2. As can be seen, benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were stable, at above 60.6% and 77.5%, respectively, and the cyclohexene yields remained above 48.5% in the first four cycles. From the fifth cycle to the seventh cycle, the benâ€� zene conversion gradually decreased. However, benzene conâ€� version was still above 50%, and the cyclohexene selectivities and yields remained above 80% and 40%, respectively. This indicates that Ruâ€�Mn(5.4%)/ZrO2 had good stability and potenâ€� tial for industrial applications. The benzene conversion deâ€� clined drastically to 33.1% in the eighth cycle. However, the cyclohexene selectivity remained as high as 85.4%. The main reasons for the deactivation of the catalyst were the loss of catalyst and the absence of regeneration for long recycling times. Sulfur and nitrogen poisoning might also deactivate the catalyst [31]. 4. Conclusions That Mn in Ruâ€�Mn(x) catalysts existed as Mn3O4 on the Ru surface. The Mn3O4 could react with ZnSO4 in the slurry to form a [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt. The [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt chemisorbed on the Ru surface played a key role in imâ€� proving the cyclohexene selectivity of the Ru catalyst. These results indicate that some catalyst promoters could react with additives to form new substances. These new substances might significantly affect the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. This might provide new ideas for understanding the action mechanism of promoters in catalysis. References [1] Zhou X L, Sun H J, Guo W, Liu Zh Y, Liu Sh Ch.

Tel: +86-371-67783384 A series of Ru-Mn catalysts with different Mn contents were prepared by coprecipitation, and their catalytic performance, using nanoscale ZrO2 as a dispersant, for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, X-ray fluorescence, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the Mn existed as Mn3O4 on the Ru surface. The Mn3O4 reacted with ZnSO4 to form an insoluble [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt, which was readily chemisorbed on the Ru surface. This chemisorbed salt played a key role in improving the cyclohexene selectivity over the Ru catalyst. The cyclohexene yield of 61.3% was obtained over the Ru-Mn catalyst with the optimum Mn content of 5.4%.

        "dc:description": "A series of Ru-Mn catalysts with different Mn contents were prepared by coprecipitation, and their catalytic performance, using nanoscale ZrO2 as a dispersant, for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N2 physisorption, X-ray fluorescence, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the Mn existed as Mn3O4 on the Ru surface. The Mn3O4 reacted with ZnSO4 to form an insoluble [Zn(OH)2]3(ZnSO4)(H2O)3 salt, which was readily chemisorbed on the Ru surface. This chemisorbed salt played a key role in improving the cyclohexene selectivity over the Ru catalyst. The cyclohexene yield of 61.3% was obtained over the Ru-Mn catalyst with the optimum Mn content of 5.4%. This catalyst had good stability and excellent reusability.",
