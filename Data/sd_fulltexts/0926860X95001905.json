Muthukumaru Pillai, V.K. Kaushik, S. Satish Research Centre, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, Baroda-391 346, India Received 10 March 1995; revised 18 July 1995; accepted 18 July 1995 Abstract Heck arylation of acrylonitrile with iodobenzene was studied over different 5% Pd supported catalysts. Among these the activity of the catalysts has the following order: Pd/C < Pd/T-AleO3 < Pd/MgO. Cinnamonitrile ( 1 ) is the major product in CH3CN medium with Pd (acac) 2 ( acac - = acetyl acetonate anion) and Pd/MgO catalysts in impregnated and reduced forms. 3,3-diphenyl acrylonitrile (2) is formed as a minor product in the consecutive reaction of 1 with iodobenzene. Change of solvent to methanol gave 2 as the major product, The reduced Pd/MgO was recycled in a series of 14 h runs and the activity of the catalyst was evaluated. Pd/MgO catalyst in impregnated, reduced, used and spent forms have been analyzed to corroborate catalyst performance and reaction mechanism with ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) findings. Keywords: Acrylonitrile arylation; Cinnamonitrile; Heck arylation; Palladium 1. Introduction Arylation of olefinic compounds is an interesting route to synthesize organic compounds [1-5]. Pd(OAc)2 is generally employed as a soluble catalyst [6-8] in this reaction. However, Pd/C has been reported as a catalyst for coupling aryl- halides with enol ethers [ 2,3,9 ]. The use of heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of organic compounds involving C-C bond formation possesses significant eco- nomical, practical and environmental importance [10]. In this method there are advantages like easy separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture, promotion of reaction by highly dispersed metal sites and understanding of the various steps * Fax.

Wali et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 83 93 involved in the mechanism of the reaction by analysis of the adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. This paper deals with the Heck arylation of acrylonitrile (ACN) with iodoben- zene using various Pd/MgO catalyst systems. These catalysts have been analyzed by ESCA to get an insight into the mechanism of the reaction. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Acrylonitrile ( IPCL, Baroda), iodobenzene ( Aldrich, USA ), PPh3 ( Fluka, Swit- zerland) and acetonitrile (Spectroscopic grade, SD Fine Chemicals, India) were used as received. Triethylamine (SD Fine Chemicals, India) was distilled over NaOH pellets before use. 5% Pd/yA1203 was purchased from Merck, Germany. 5% Pd/C and 5% Pd/ MgO were prepared from Palladium(II) chloride [ 11 ] and bis (acetylacetonato) palladium(II) respectively by impregnation and reduced under H2 flow (30 ml/ min) for 4 h at 60. The nomenclature employed for different Pd/MgO is as follows: Pd(acac) 2 / MgO = impregnated Pd/ MgO Pd(acac)z/MgO reduced with H2 = reduced Pd/MgO Reduced catalyst after a 14 h run = used Pd/MgO Reduced catalyst after three recycles of 14 h run = spent Pd/MgO 2.2. Arylation of acrylonitrile The reactions were conducted in a 100 ml high pressure reactor containing a magnetic bar. Under a flow of N2 the catalyst, CH3CN, iodobenzene, acrylonitrile, Et3N and PPh3 were added in the same order to the reactor. The reactor was then pressurized to 25 psi with N2. The reactor was heated in an oil bath at 140 under vigorous agitation. After 14 h the reactor was cooled, depressurised and the reaction mixture was separated from the catalyst by filtration. The product was separated by a standard work-up and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) on a 2 metre column coated with 15% OV-17 on chromosorb W at 55-200 under a tem- perature programme using flame ionisation detector and an internal standard. Cinnamonitrile (1) and 3,3-diphenyl acrylonitrile (2) were separated from the reaction mixture by passing through a silica gel column using petroleum ether as eluent. They were further identified by mass, 1H and ~3C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were done on a Shimadzu 7AG GC. Mass spectra were recorded on HP 5890 while a Jeol JNM FX 100 instrument was used for recording NMR. A. Wali et al./ Applied Catal~,sis A: General 135 (1996) 83-93 85 2.3. ESCA experiments A vacuum Generator's ESCALAB MK II spectrometer with a Mg Ka ( 1253.6 eV) radiation source was used for measurement of various photoelectron lines in Pd/MgO catalysts. The anode of the source was operated at 10 kV and 10 mA and the vacuum in the analysis chamber was ensured to be better than 5.10-s mbar. The spectrometer was calibrated using the Cu(2p3/2) photoelectron line [ 12] at 932.7 eV and the Ag (3d5/2) photoelectron line [ 13] at 368.3 eV. Catalyst samples were dusted on double side adhesive tape and mounted on a sample holder. Each catalyst sample was kept overnight in the preparation chamber before being trans- ferred to the analysis chamber for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) anal- ysis. The C(1S) photoelectron line at 285.0 eV from pump oil contamination was used as reference in binding energy measurements. Multiscan data were recorded and analyzed using an Apple IIe microcomputer interfacing the spectrometer. At least three different runs were taken for measurement of binding energy of photo- electron lines and reported values are the average of these measurements with an accuracy of + 0.1 eV. 3. Results and discussion Acrylonitrile reacts with iodobenzene in the presence of Pd catalyst to give (E/ Z) cinnamonitrile (1) smoothly in a single step (Scheme 1). This is a valuable and expensive organic chemical and/or an intermediate for the synthesis of benzopyran derivatives [ 14]. In this reaction 2 is also formed either as a minor or major product depending upon the experimental conditions. 3.1. Evaluation of Pd/support catalysts Several 5% Pd/support catalysts were examined for the conversion of acrylo- nitrile to 1 and the results are summarized in Table 1. At the mole ratio of Pd: ACN = 1:100 reduced Pd/y-A1203 and Pd/MgO exhibited high activity. The activ- ity of the catalysts followed the trend: Pd/C < Pd(acac)2 < Pd/y-AI203 < Pd/ MgO. The highest conversion was observed on Pd/MgO. Interestingly, the ratio of (E) to (Z) isomers of 1 formed over supported Pd catalysts was distinct from the homogeneous counterpart. Further, 2 was formed as byproduct over Pd/y- A1203 and Pd/MgO. Dossi et al. [ 15 ] reported that chloride free Pd/MgO catalysts showed high activity for alkane aromatization. It is argued that electron transfer from the strongly basic 02- surface ion to the metal surface leads to 'anchoring' [ Pd] ~J\"t[-.I- /J\"~-CN 140'c,14h ~ I.~F./Z)\"{'Ph~'~cN Scheme 1. 86 A.

The higher activity of Pd/MgO catalyst may be due to such strongly supported palladium on MgO. This catalyst was investigated further to understand the mechanism of arylation of acrylonitrile with iodobenzene. 3.2. Role of different components of the medium Table 2 clearly shows that Et3N is an essential component for the arylation of acrylonitrile on Pd/MgO. Et3N acts as a base to neutralize the HI formed in the reaction of acrylonitrile and iodobenzene and hence there is no activity with these catalysts in the absence of this base.

This further proves that cleavage of the P-Ph bond of PPh3 does not take place on Pd/MgO. This reaction is otherwise known to occur in Heck arylation of alkenes with a homogeneous catalyst system [16,17]. The ratio of iodobenzene to ACN is another important factor in this reaction. In presence of excess ACN the formation of 2 can be reduced (Table 3). Addition of PPh3 improved the efficiency of the catalyst possibly by interacting with Pd metal centre as a ~-acceptor and in reducing Pd2+ to Pdcentre (Scheme 2). It is known [ 18] that Pdspecies are generated when Pd(OAc)2 and PPh3 react in the liquid phase. In our study in presence of PPh3 it is observed that the selectivity to 2 is relatively higher than in PPh3 free system (runs 5 and 2). Impregnated Pd/MgO (run 5) behaves similarly to the homogeneous Pd(acac)2 catalyst (run 9).

MgO (run 5). Unlike Pd(acac)2 and impregnated Pd/MgO, formation of 2 was favoured only on reduced Pd/MgO (runs 2, 5, 7) whereas 1 was selectively formed on the other catalysts. The nature of reaction medium was also an important param- eter as the weakly basic methanol solvent (run 11 ) favoured formation of 2 whereas 1 was the predominant product in CH3CN. However, in THF there was no reaction at all. On reduced Pd/MgO, when 1 was allowed to react with iodobenzene at 140 and 1/Pd= 100 (molar ratio) the yield of 2 was 49% in a 14 h run. It was further observed that in the 14 h run although the conversion was higher than that of the 10 h run the selectivity to 1 remains lowered (Table 4) thereby suggesting the further reaction between 1 and iodobenzene. There is no arylation reaction with bromobenzene under conditions of run 5. 3.3. Performance of Pd/MgO on the arylation of acrylonitrile The reduced Pd/MgO was recycled in several runs for arylation of acrylonitrile to examine the stability and the life of the catalyst (Table 4). On a freshly reduced Pd/MgO both 1 and 2 are formed. On the first recycled Pd/MgO the reaction was almost complete with the selective formation of pure 1. In the second and third recycles the activity of the catalyst decreases slowly with increasing formation of 2. Atomic absorption spectral analysis of liquid product after a run shows 0.13% of whatever Pd loaded on MgO is leached out. Further, the formation of arylated product in the recycle runs by the same Pd/MgO suggests that the reaction is indeed promoted by Pd metal dispersed on the support. In the series of arylation runs at 10 h (Table 4) the catalyst in general has higher selectivity to 1 compared to 14 h runs. Pd/MgO catalysts in impregnated, reduced, used and spent forms have been examined by ESCA to get an insight into the mechanism of the reaction. A. Wali et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 83-93 89 [bl {a) [ I~OO o ~ ~ E leVI =- Fig. 1. XPS survey scans of (a) impregnated Pd/MgO and (b) reduced Pd/MgO. 3.4. ESCA results The survey spectra of impregnated and reduced Pd/MgO catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The high intensity of C(IS) and low intensity of Pd(3d) and Mg(2s) photoelectron lines in impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst show that palladium exists as a complex on MgO support. Expectedly thus, this catalyst behaves the same way as the precursor palladium (II) acetylacetonate (Table 2). A decrease of 1.7 eV in the palladium binding energy of Pd ( acac ) 2 / MgO ( 336.6 eV) from Pd (acac) 2 ( 338.3 eV) indicates transfer of electron from support to palladium precursor [ 19]. Reduction of this catalyst at 60 for 4 h in hydrogen flow further decreases the binding energy and improves the availability of palladium on MgO support with a concomitant decrease in surface carbon content (Fig. lb). The measurement of Pd(3ds/2) binding energy (i.e. 335.4 eV) and its broadening towards higher bind- ing energy shows incomplete reduction of the catalyst at 60. The change in Pd binding energy, improvement in its dispersion on support and reduction in the amount of carbon on surface suggests displacement of acac- ligand coordinated to Pd metal on reduction of catalyst. The survey spectrum of impregnated catalyst after first cycle of reaction is shown in Fig. 2. An increase in Pd(3ds/2)/Mg(2s) intensity ratio for the first recycle catalyst by a factor of 1.35 compared to the reduced catalyst and strong iodine (3d) photoelectron lines on the catalyst indicates that HI is chemisorbed on the basic sites of MgO support. This additional role of MgO certainly contributes towards higher activity of Pd/MgO. 90 A. Wali et al. / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 135 (1996) 83 93 c.4 u x~ t I 0 ~ B.E. leVl ~ 1000 Fig. 2.

A comparison of Pd(3ds/2; 3d3/2) photoelectron lines for impregnated and used Pd/MgO catalysts are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b. It can be seen from the data presented in Table 2 that the conversion is better in the case of the reduced Pd/ MgO catalyst. The presence of Pdspecies in this catalyst and the comparison of its product data with impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst clearly indicate that the pres- ence of zero valent palladium facilitates double arylation of ACN leading to a lower selectivity of 1 on reduced Pd/MgO catalyst. The binding energy data [20] shown in Fig. 3 and comparison of them with fresh catalysts indicate in situ reduction of Pd2 + centres during reaction. The survey spectrum of spent Pd/MgO catalyst is shown in Fig. 4. This catalyst has low activity for arylation of ACN. It is clear from the spectrum that the surface of the catalyst is covered with hydrocarbon and no zero valent palladium state is seen ( see Fig. 3c). Thus carbon deposit on the catalyst surface and non-availability of palladium in zero valent state seem to be probable reasons of catalyst deactivation. 3.5. Mechanism The mechanism of the reaction [ 21,22 ] in a simplified form is given in Scheme 2. The ESCA study clearly shows that in impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst Pd(acac)2 is anchored on the MgO support through a strong metal-support interaction yielding an electron rich metal surface. From the same study it is observed that the acac- ligand is displaced from the impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst on reduction and coor- dinatively unsaturated Pd2+ and Pdsites are generated during the reaction. Through the basic 02- sites MgO neutralizes the HI formed in the Heck reaction along with Et3N. Formation of 1 by route A is the predominant reaction. On reduced Pd/MgO catalyst Pdsites are formed during H2 reduction. On these Pdsites both ACN and 1 compete for coordination and subsequent arylation also. Pdspecies are known to be stabilized by electron poor alkenes [22] such as 1. This facilitates second insertion of iodobenzene on the Pdcentre (route B) leading to formation 92 A. Wali et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 135 (1996) 83-93 of 2. The high yield of 2 in methanol solvent suggests that the presence of basic sites adjacent to the Pd metal centre favours route B. From the ESCA study, it is apparent that the decrease in activity of the reduced Pd/MgO catalyst in recycles is due to gradual masking of Pd sites with hydrocar- bons and generation of non-reducible Pd2+ sites (Fig. 4). Deactivation is most probably due to coke generated from the phenyl group of iodobenzene as the surface is devoid of any species containing nitrogen atoms. If the basic oxygen of MgO inserts into the reactive Pd-Ph bond (Scheme 2) Ph-O-Pd species can be formed. These species are non-reducible under the reaction conditions. 4. Conclusions Heck arylation of acrylonitrile with iodobenzene is favourably amenable to catalysis by the palladium metal dispersed on MgO, C and \"y-Al203. Reduced Pd/ MgO has higher activity than the various supported Pd catalysts. ESCA study of the impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst shows Pd(acac)2 is anchored on the MgO sup- port with transfer of electron from the support to palladium metal. On reduction with hydrogen, acac- ligand is displaced and the Pd2+ ions are partially reduced to the metallic state with considerable improvement in availability of palladium on the surface of the support. Reduced Pd/MgO catalyst leads to both 1 and 2 whereas 1 is the only product with impregnated Pd/MgO catalyst. During the arylation reaction in situ reduction of Pd2 + to Pdtakes place. MgO has the additional role of neutralising HI on its basic sites. The deactivation of the catalyst takes place because of the gradual accumulation of carbon deposit and transformation of Pd metal centres into non-reducible Pd2 + on the surface of the catalyst.

All rights reserved IPCL Communication No. 281 Arylation of acrylonitrile with iodobenzene over Pd/MgO catalyst Anil Wali * S. Muthukumaru Pillai V.K. Kaushik S. Satish Research Centre, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, Baroda -391 346,India * Fax. (+91-265) 372098. Heck arylation of acrylonitrile with iodobenzene was studied over different 5% Pd supported catalysts. Among these the activity of the catalysts has the following order: Pd/C< Pd/γ-Al2O3< Pd/MgO. Cinnamonitrile (1) is the major product in CH3CN medium with Pd(acac)2 (acac− = acetyl acetonate anion) and Pd/MgO catalysts in impregnated and reduced forms. 3,3-diphenyl acrylonitrile (2) is formed as a minor product in the consecutive reaction of1 with iodobenzene. Change of solvent to methanol gave2 as the major product. The reduced Pd/MgO was recycled in a series of 14 h runs and the activity of the catalyst was evaluated. Pd/MgO catalyst in impregnated, reduced, used and spent forms have been analyzed to corroborate catalyst performance and reaction mechanism with ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) findings.
