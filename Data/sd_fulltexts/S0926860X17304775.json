Graphical abstract Two preparation methods and two metal salt precursors (chlorine containing and chlorine-free) were used to synthesize Ru/CeO2 catalysts and their catalytic behaviour has been evaluated in combustion of propane, n-butane and isobutane mixture. In the first method, Ru nanoparticles (Ru NPs) deposited on CeO2 were synthesized by a microwave-assisted polyol method using RuCl3 as a metal precursor and ethylene glycol as a reducing agent. In the second, Ru/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by traditional incipient wetness impregnation method using RuCl3 or Ru(NO)(NO3)3. ICP-AES, N2 adsorption-desorption, H2-TPR, XRD, HRTEM and SEM-EDS techniques were used to characterize the catalysts. In all the Ru/CeO2 catalysts only highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles (1–2nm) were present. The catalytic data show that the preparation method and the nature of the metal precursor have a significant influence on catalytic performance of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts. The VOC reactivity order (iso-butane > n-butane > propane) show that propane is the most difficult to oxidize. The Ru(NPs)/CeO2 and impregnated Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity and stability than that of impregnated Ru(Cl)/CeO2. It was found that the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst was free of chlorine species although it had been prepared from RuCl3. The differences in the activity have been ascribed to the presence of Cl− ions on the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst and to much better reducibility of the chlorine-free Ru(NPs) and Ru(N) catalysts. The Cl species have a negative impact on the redox properties of CeO2, they have some influence on Ru agglomeration during long-term activity tests (50h), and consequently, the chlorinated catalyst exhibited a poorer activity and stability compared with those of the Cl-free catalysts. Keywords Catalytic combustion Ru/CeO2 catalyst Effect of preparation Effect of precursor salt 1 Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are recognized as major components of air pollution because of their toxicity to human health and their involvement in the formation of photochemical smog. Among the different techniques available to reduce VOCs emission, catalytic combustion appears to be one of the most efficient [1] since it can operate with dilute VOCs effluent streams and at much lower temperature (100–400°C) than conventional thermal combustion (>800°C). The development of noble metals (mainly Pt, Pd, Rh and Au) and metal oxides (for example CeO2, MnO x , CoO x , CrOx, CuO) as catalysts for VOCs oxidation has been widely reported in the literature and the research field continues to be very active [2,3]. Particularly ceria has been found to be a promising catalyst in the total oxidation of VOCs, either pure or in combination with noble metals or other metal oxides [4,5]. The promoting effect of cerium oxide is mainly related to its ability to a facile shift between Ce4+ and Ce3+ states under oxidative and reductive conditions and its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) [6,7]. Additionally, when CeO2 is used as high surface area support for noble metals such as Pt, Pd and Au, the catalytic systems are particularly active for VOCs oxidation at low temperature, due to the increased metal dispersion and to CeO2 participation in the reaction [3,8]. Redox properties are substantially enhanced by formation of metal-ceria contacts, although significant differences can be produced if counteranions of the metal salt precursor are partially retained on the surface of the catalysts during its preparation [4,9]. Especially, the presence of residual chloride decreases the extent of reduction/oxidation effects modifying the OSC capacity of ceria [10,11] and affecting VOC combustion in metal-supported catalysts. Bernal et al. [12] found that in the Rh/CeO2 catalysts prepared from chlorinated metal precursor, a highly stable cerium oxychloride at the temperature as low as 300°C was formed, which limits the spillover of hydrogen responsible for the reduction of ceria. Kępiński and Okal [13] studied the mechanism of the CeOCl formation in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared using a chlorinated precursor, PdCl2, and found that at low reduction temperature Cl− ions remain strongly chemisorbed on ceria which cause changes in the textural, structural and chemical properties of the support. Recently, Abdelouahab-Reddam et al. [14] observed a much higher catalytic activity of chlorinated Pt/CeO2/C catalysts for the complete oxidation of ethanol comparing to those of the Cl-free catalysts. This behaviour was correlated with a high platinum dispersion and a strong metal-CeO2 interaction in these catalysts, which promotes their redox properties. The effect of CeO2 on the combustion activity of noble metal catalysts is also largely dependent on catalysts pre-treatments and the employed reaction conditions [15,16]. Previously, we investigated the effect of chlorine and the pre-treatment procedure (reduction-oxidation) on the performance of the Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for combustion of butane [17] and propane [18]. It was found that the presence of chloride on the catalyst surface as well as oxidation of the catalysts at high temperature leads to much lower activity of the Ru phase. We suppose that ceria as a support can be a promising candidate to improve the catalytic performance and especially stability of the ruthenium phase in the total oxidation of light alkanes, not only by its well-known redox properties, but also because the properties of the metals deposited on the support can be modified by strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [9,19]. The strong metal-support interaction prevents metal particle from sintering, which also contributes to catalyst deactivation. Aouad et al. [20] reported a strong metal-ceria interaction with ruthenium via the formation of RuOCe bonds in the well-dispersed Ru species which are highly fragile and its mobile oxygen is the active species in the carbon and VOCs oxidation. At present catalytic materials based on Ru and ceria or ceria-zirconia are being thoroughly investigated for several oxidation reactions, for example oxidation of organic pollutants in waste water [6,21–23], liquid-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohols [24], simultaneous oxidation of carbon black and VOCs like propene and toluene [20,25], oxidation of ethyl acetate [26], CO oxidation [27] and, more recently, soot oxidation [27–30]. Mitsui et al. [26] compared the catalytic performance of CeO2-supported noble metals such as Ru, Pt, Pd and Rh, in oxidation of ethyl acetate and found that the Ru-containing catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity. Recently, Matarrese et al. [31] investigated ceria/zirconia catalysts doped with Pt, Au, Ru or Fe for simultaneous removal of NOx and soot and found that the Ru-based system was more active than the reference Pt-K/Al2O3 catalyst in both soot combustion and NOx storage capacity. Moreover, in the past few years, a considerable effort was focused on the studies on the catalytic combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons (like chlorobenzene) over Ru-doped ceria catalysts [32,33]. However, it can be noted that complete catalytic oxidation of light alkanes/alkenes over Ru/CeO2 catalysts has received relatively little attention. Currently available studies were primarily focused on the catalytic oxidation of a single VOC pollutant, and catalytic evaluation and stability test were commonly reported. In the present study, the catalytic performance of Ru/CeO2 catalysts for total oxidation of propane, n-butane and isobutane mixture was investigated for the first time with respect to the preparation methods (microwave-polyol or incipient wetness impregnation) and the nature of metal salt precursors, RuCl3 ×3H2O or Ru(NO)(NO3)3. Microwave-assisted synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) represents a sustainable and green approach to preparation of supported nanostructured catalysts using environmentally friendly and less energy-demanding conditions, compared with those involved in conventional methods. The preparation of ceria supported Ru NPs under microwave-solvothermal conditions using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent has not been reported in the literature. This synthesis technique is very attractive as it allows obtaining a heterogeneous catalyst with well-defined metal particle morphology (shape and size). At present, the studied VOCs compounds are released to the atmosphere in increasing amounts since liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of primarily propane and butane, is used even more as a substitute for gasoline and diesel in transport vehicles. These light alkanes, emitted also from stationary power sources, have much larger detrimental greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide. The nature of the used metal precursor is important because it can yield chemical and structural differences visible particularly in the catalysts prepared from a Cl-containing precursor. The presence of residual chlorine ions on the catalyst promotes stability of cerium in a low oxidation state with possible formation of cerium oxychloride and can affect the adsorption and catalytic properties of the catalyst in oxidation of light alkanes. The experiments were conducted with the use of Ru/CeO2 catalysts of the same metal loading (5wt.%). Structural studies were also performed to correlate the intrinsic properties of the catalyst materials to their catalytic performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts RuCl3 ×3H2O (Alfa-Aesar) and Ru(NO)(NO3)3 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as metal salt precursors. A commercial CeO2 oxide (Aldrich, nanopowder, 544,841) was calcined in static air at 600°C for 3h prior to use for catalysts preparation. Ruthenium deposition (5wt.%) on the ceria support was carried out by two different preparation methods. The first one − the polyol reduction method − involved in situ deposition of Ru nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., reduction of RuCl3 with ethylene glycol (EG) in the presence of the ceria support. First, 0.27g RuCl3 was dissolved in 50ml of ethylene glycol and then 2g of CeO2 was added to form a suspension. The mixture was magnetically stirred for 15min at room temperature (RT) and next put in a Teflon vessel placed in an autoclave with microwave heating (MW Reactor, Ertec, Poland). The synthesis time was set up to 20min and reaction proceeded at 180°C under autogenic pressure of ∼20atm. After the reaction was completed the vessel was rapidly cooled down in an ice-water bath. A grey solid was filtered off, washed several times using aq. (0.3M) NaNO3 solution, next with distilled water to remove the chlorine and sodium ions and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature (RT). The sample was stored in a closed container until using it and it was designated as Ru(NPs)/CeO2. We also studied the reactivity of the bare CeO2 support in EG under the same conditions as the ones used for preparation of the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst. In the second method, Ru/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation technique using an aqueous solution of RuCl3·or Ru(NO)(NO3)3 as a metal precursor. After impregnation, the samples were stirred for 4h at room temperature, next dried overnight at 110°C and finally activated by reduction under hydrogen flow (30cm3/min) at 400°C for 5h (3°C/min). After reduction, the catalyst samples were cooled to RT in H2 flow and then were slowly exposed to air. The samples prepared by this method were designated as Ru(Cl)/CeO2 and Ru(N)/CeO2, respectively. Since some catalysts were obtained from Ru chloride we also prepared a Cl/CeO2 sample by impregnation of ceria with sufficient amount of HCl aq. solution to yield a similar content of chlorine (5.5wt.%) as in the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst. Next, after drying the Cl/CeO2 sample at 110°C, it was treated in H2 flow at 400°C for 5h. 2.2 Catalysts characterization The ruthenium content in the catalysts was determined by ICP-AES method (Thermo Scientific ICAP 7000). Chemical composition of the samples was checked with a FEI NovaNanoSEM 230 FE-SEM microscope equipped with EDS (EDAX Genesis XM4). The crystalline structure of the catalysts was analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using PANanalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ=0.15406nm). The data were recorded in the 10−80° 2Θ range with an angular step of 0.017° and a counting time of 0.26s per step. Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. Microstructure characterization and dispersion measurements of the catalyst samples were performed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) with a Philips CM 20 Super-Twin microscope, which at 200kV provides 0.25nm resolution. The HRTEM images and SAED patterns were analysed with the Digital Micrograph program. The textural properties of the support and Ru-based catalysts were obtained from nitrogen physisorption measurements at −196°C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The samples (∼0.2g) were degassed in vacuum at 300°C for 3h prior to the measurements. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The total pore volume (Vp) was determined at a relative pressure of P/Po =0.98, and the mean pore diameter (Dp) for mesopores was determined by Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method from the desorption branch of the isotherm. Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were performed on 50mg of ceria or Ru/CeO2 catalysts previously subjected to oxidative treatment in air at 400°C for 1h. H2-TPR measurements of the samples were carried out by using a Micrometrics Autochem II 2920 apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Before the experiment the samples were first flushed with helium at 200°C for 30min and then cooled to RT. The H2-TPR profiles were obtained by heating the samples under a 5% H2/Ar flow (30cm3/min) from room temperature to 600°C at a rate of 5°C/min. TCD signal was calibrated with CuO (99.99% Sigma-Aldrich) to calculate the hydrogen consumption. 2.3 Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic tests for combustion of C3-C4 mixture were conducted in a quartz micro-reactor (i.d.=10mm, length=350mm) by loading catalyst powder on a quartz wool bed and under atmospheric pressure. The amount of catalyst was fixed at 400mg and the total flow of alkanes/air, with the volumetric ratio of 1:500, was maintained with a rate of 15l/h (gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)=21,000h−1). The reactor was placed into a tubular programmable furnace and the temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored with a thermocouple protected by a quartz tube inserted in the centre of the catalyst bed. The gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers. Before activity measurements, the catalyst samples were treated in the reactant gas mixture at 100°C for 1h to remove moisture and adsorbed impurities. The activity of the catalysts was measured as a function of temperature between 100 and 300°C at a temperature step of 10°C in a typical heating cycle run. Each temperature was maintained for 20min and then the effluent gases were analysed on-line using a gas chromatograph (Chromatron GCHF 18.3) with a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion data were reproducible within 5% accuracy. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure characterization of Ru/CeO2 catalysts The chemical composition and multi-point EDS analysis of the synthesized materials are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S1 (Supplementary material). The Ru loading in the reduced Ru/CeO2 catalysts ranging from 4.7 to 5.1wt.%, measured by the chemical analysis (ICP-AES), is statistically the same as the nominal loading of 5wt.%. The EDS determined Ru content in the Ru(N)/CeO2 sample is also close to the predicted value, while in the Ru(Cl) and Ru(NPs)/CeO2 catalysts larger differences were noticed. In the Ru(N) catalyst metal particles were probably more homogeneously distributed over the support in comparison with those of the Ru(Cl) or Ru(NPs) samples. According to multi-point EDS analysis the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst, although prepared from RuCl3 precursor, was free of chlorine contamination (Fig. S1 c). This is a very important result because chloride ions could not affect catalytic properties of Ru NPs synthesized by colloidal method. Opposite, the impregnated Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst after reduction in H2 at 400°C, contains a large amount of chloride (∼11wt.%, Table 1). The literature data show that ceria-based catalysts are able to retain significant amounts of Cl even after reduction with pure hydrogen up to 900°C [13,34]. In the Cl/CeO2 sample, also treated in H2 at 400°C, the amount of Cl is much lower ∼1.6wt.%. A comparable chlorine content (about 1.5wt.%) was found by Rivas et al. [35] for CeO2 subjected to a similar chlorination procedure (impregnation with a concentrated HCl solution). Additionally, only in the chlorine-containing Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst much lower oxygen content (11wt.%) as compared to the bare ceria (20.4wt.%) or Cl/CeO2 sample (21wt.%) and the chlorine-free Ru catalysts (∼20wt.%) was detected (Table 1). Such a large oxygen loss (by about 45%) corresponds to nearly complete surface reduction of ceria (i.e. from Ce4+ to Ce3+) and indicates that chloride ions were exchanged with lattice O2−. According to the literature data maximum 50% of the surface O2− ions can be replaced by Cl− ions and then a surface CeOCl phase is formed [13,34]. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the bare CeO2 and reduced Ru/CeO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. S2 (Supplementary material). All the samples exhibit the classical shape of the IV type isotherm (according to the IUPAC recommendation) typical for mesoporous materials. The BET surface area, mean pore diameter (Dp) and pore volume (Vp) for the starting CeO2 sample calcined at 600°C were 79m2/g, 21.1nm and 0.44cm3/g, respectively. The BET surface area of CeO2 after calcination and H2 treatment at 400°C is only slightly lower (by ∼6%). Treatment of CeO2 with an aqueous HCl solution (with a comparable chlorine content as that used in the preparation of the catalysts with the RuCl3 precursor), causes further small decrease (∼10%) of its original BET surface area and the pore volume drops from 0.44cm3/g to 0.38cm3/g (see Table 2 ). More notable textural modifications were observed for the Ru/CeO2 catalysts. These included a progressive drop in the surface area and pore volume along with a significant decrease in the pore size, most probably due to the partial plugging of the pores with the metal particles. As shown in Table 2, the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst was most affected with the decrease in the BET surface area by 45% in comparison with the impregnated Ru(Cl)/CeO2 (23%) and Ru(N)/CeO2 catalysts (18%). For this reason, the usefulness of the CeO2 support for the in situ ruthenium deposition using ethylene glycol (EG) under microwave irradiation (MW) was also evaluated. For this purpose CeO2 after calcination at 600°C was treated in EG under the same reaction conditions (180°C, 20min) as the ones used for the synthesis of Ru(NPs)/CeO2. As shown in Table 2, the original BET surface area was lower by 19% after treatment in EG (60m2/g), and the pore volume drops from 0.44cm3/g to 0.24cm3/g which may be a result of adsorption of organic molecules at both external and internal surfaces of CeO2 oxide. In order to remove organic residues from the CeO2(EG) sample it was heated in air at 600°C for 5h, but this treatment only slightly improved the textural properties of the sample (SBET =63m2/g,Vp =0.25cm3/g and Dp =12.6nm). It is also possible that the reaction of ethylene glycol and CeO2 leads to a partial reduction of Ce(IV), as it was previously reported by Ho et al. [36]. The XRD patterns of CeO2 before and after microwave irradiation (Fig. S3, Supplementary material) were almost identical, which suggests that its original crystal structure was preserved under MW-treatment in the presence of EG. TEM studies also revealed no significant changes in the morphology of ceria (images not shown). The structural properties of the samples were characterized by XRD and the patterns of the bare CeO2 calcined at 600°C and the reduced 5% Ru/CeO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 . The reference peak position of the hcp-structured Ru metal (JCPDS 6-0663) is also indicated. The XRD patterns reveal the presence of diffraction peaks at approximately 2Θ values of 28.5°, 33.0°, 47.3° and 56.2°, that are related only to the fluorite-type CeO2 phase with the cubic crystal structure (JCPDS 34-0394). In the XRD pattern of the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 1, pattern b) the bulk CeOCl phase was not observed (for example at 2Θ ∼14°), similarly as in the Cl/CeO2 sample reduced at the same temperature (pattern not shown). It is possible that although the Cl content of the Ru(Cl) sample (Table 1, EDS analysis) was high enough to form a CeOCl phase detectable by XRD but the reduction temperature was too low to form this compound. The literature data show that in the Cl/CeO2 and Rh(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst, CeOCl phase was observed by XRD for reduction temperature only at or above 600°C [34]. For the Pd(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst three-dimensional CeOCl crystallites, detected by XRD, were formed at or above 400°C [10]. In our studies, the diffraction lines are rather broad and the mean crystallite sizes, calculated by application of the Scherrer equation to the (111) ceria diffraction peak, of the ceria samples and the Ru/CeO2 catalysts are within the margin of error the same 27–30nm (Table 2). The diffraction lines of Ru metal (at around 44°) or any ruthenium oxides (at around 28° or 35°) were not observed (Fig. 1) indicating that the ruthenium species are well dispersed at the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals or partly incorporated into the CeO2 lattices to form solid solution. A possible incorporation of ruthenium into the ceria fluorite lattice (i.e. substitution of Ce4+ ions with smaller Ru3+ ions) could result in contraction of the unit cell volume. As it is shown in Table 2, the lattice parameters of the impregnated Ru(Cl)/CeO2 (acell =0.54151nm) and Ru(N)/CeO2 (acell =0.54110nm) catalysts are similar to that of bare CeO2 (acell =0.54127nm), hence incorporation of Ru ions into the CeO2 lattice is rather precluded. The observed small changes of the lattice parameters, for example for the CeO2 treated in H2 at 400°C (acell =0.54050nm) or for the MW-synthesized Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst (acell =0.54088nm), as compared to that of CeO2 (acell =0.54127nm), can rather be explained by an increase of the number of oxygen vacancies and/or defects in the ceria lattice [4]. TEM was used to examine the morphology of the reduced Ru/CeO2 catalysts. It was impossible to detect the Ru phase in the TEM images (at lower magnification) as well as in the SAED patterns of all the Ru catalysts. For example, Fig. S4 (Supplementary material) shows the TEM image and SAED pattern (as inset) of the as-prepared Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst. The SAED pattern contains only rings and spots from the ceria support and confirms its face-centered cubic crystal structure. The crystallite size of CeO2 is included in the range of 6–44nm, which is in a good agreement with the XRD data (Table 2). Fig. 2 shows high-magnification HRTEM images of all the 5% Ru/CeO2 catalysts. Only some Ru particles with an approximate diameter of 1–2nm can be scarcely distinguished and the ruthenium particle size could not be quantified due to the very high Ru dispersion, which is in an agreement with the XRD and SAED results. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (insets in Fig. 2A and C) from the small particles contain spots corresponding to metallic Ru (101) (0.21nm lattice fringes), whereas FFT patterns of the large crystallites contain spots corresponding to CeO2 (111) (0.31nm lattice fringes) (insets in Fig. 2A and B) or to CeO2 (200) (0.27nm), (inset to Fig. 2C). For the Ru(N)/CeO2 sample no evidence of the formation of crystalline Ru was found (Fig. 2B) and only small amorphous Ru particles at the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals are rarely visible. Therefore, the HRTEM results may indicate that only a little amount of a ruthenium phase may be present as small metal nanoparticles in the studied catalysts. However, the presence of the ruthenium phase was confirmed by EDS and ICP analysis (Table 1). A similar observation was described in the literature for platinum and palladium catalysts supported on ceria [16,37]. Small platinum or palladium particles deposited on ceria usually could not be detected by TEM due to a small contrast between the metal particle and the support. The literature data indicate that although ceria is known to promote noble metal dispersion, ruthenium at the surface of the Ru/CeO2 catalyst was found to be poorly dispersed (Ru particle size between 8 and 12 and 20–30nm, depending on the BET surface area of CeO2) [6], or opposite highly dispersed [39]. In Ref. [38] the authors found by TEM observation that well-dispersed Ru/CeO2 catalysts, with average Ru particle size of 1.9nm, could be prepared by impregnation of the ceria support (24m2/g) with an aqueous solution of Ru(NO)(NO3)3 with ultrasound assistance and with further reduction in H2 at 500°C. 3.2 Temperature-programmed reduction H2-TPR experiments H2-TPR measurements were performed in order to assess the redox behaviour of the studied catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of the pure ceria and Ru(Cl), Ru(N) and Ru(NPs) catalysts. Before performing this reaction, the samples were heated in the flow of helium at 200°C to remove the adsorbed water and the residual water in the reactor. In the temperature range (RT–600°C), the CeO2 sample exhibits one broad reduction peak with a maximum at 425°C and a shoulder at lower temperature (343°C), both attributed to the reduction of the surface Ce4+ species [40]. The reduction of bulk oxygen of ceria does not appear in the TPR profile of the ceria sample (Fig. 3, profile a), occurring at T>700°C [40,41], and not being largely affected by addition of noble metals [4]. The TPR profiles of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts exhibited two reduction peaks, indicating that RuO2 exists in two different states. Depending on the preparation method, the first reduction peaks are located at 63–93°C and they are attributed to reduction of highly dispersed Ru species, while the second larger peaks at 116–130°C are due to reduction of agglomerated ruthenium oxide species. The temperature value of these peaks is lower than that of the bulk RuO2 reduction, in the 97–176°C range [42]. It can be noted that all the Ru oxide species deposited on CeO2 could not be observed by XRD or HRTEM studies. Recently, Aouad et al. [43] found by TPR and ESR techniques that in the impregnated Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst with Ru loading of 1.65wt.%, only well dispersed ruthenium oxide species that are reduced at ∼74°C are present, while for higher ruthenium loadings (5wt.%), an additional type of ruthenium oxide agglomerates form and the latter are reduced at higher temperature (136°C). Several studies of the ruthenium/ceria reducibility showed that Ru species with reduction peaks at lower temperature are small in size, well dispersed and having bridging oxygen with ceria surface [20,22,24,25]. Hokosawa et al. [22] identified the RuOCe bond in the 6.5% Ru/CeO2 catalyst (prepared from RuCl3) by H2-TPR and XRD measurements. In another study [44], the same authors showed by EXAFS measurements that in the 5% Ru/CeO2 catalyst calcined at 500°C, both RuOCe and Ru–O–Ru species were formed and after calcination at 800°C an extensive segregation of RuO2 on CeO2 was observed. From Fig. 3 it is clearly seen that oxidized ruthenium species in the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst were more easily reduced (maxima at 63°C and 116°C, pattern b) than those in the impregnated Ru(N) and especially Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalysts, for which a larger shift of the Ru reduction peaks to higher temperature was observed (93°C and 130°C, pattern d) indicating therefore that their reducibility is more difficult. It is noteworthy that the TPR profile of the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 sample did not show higher temperature reduction peaks (343°C and 425°C) observed for pure CeO2, while the TPR profiles of both impregnated Ru catalysts show only a very small peak at about 415°C (Fig. S5, Supplementary material). Our TPR results evidence that reduction of the CeO2 surface is accelerated by Ru species and occurs simultaneously with reduction of the Ru species. Table 3 shows the amount of H2 consumed by Ru/CeO2 and CeO2 in the low (up to 200°C) and high temperature range (up to 600°C). The theoretical hydrogen consumption for the 5% Ru/CeO2 samples was calculated on the basis of the following equation; RuO2 +2H2 →Ru°+2H2O, thus assuming that all of the Ru species are in the form of RuO2. In the Ru/CeO2 catalysts, except for the chlorine-containing sample, the hydrogen consumption below 200°C exceeds the theoretical value of RuO2 reduction (990μmol H2/g), indicating that some fraction of surface CeO2 was reduced. In this low-temperature range, the hydrogen consumption by pure CeO2 is very low (2.6μmol H2/g). The promotion of the CeO2 surface reduction by ruthenium species is particularly high for the chlorine-free Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst prepared by colloidal method. For this catalyst, the H2 consumption below 200°C equals to 1356μmol H2/g and corresponds to that necessary for total reduction of the ceria surface together with the reduction of RuO2 to Ruo. This accounts for the absence of the CeO2 surface reduction peak at higher temperature (Fig. S5). It must be underlined that all the samples investigated in this work exhibited comparable values of BET surface area (60–44m2/g, Table 2), ruling out claiming that the higher reducibility can be ascribed to the higher surface area. The acceleration of the reduction of ceria surface can be explained either by hydrogen spillover from Ru species to the surface of CeO2 facilitating the reduction of surface Ce4+ or by oxygen migration from CeO2 to Ru species, where the oxygen reacts with hydrogen yielding water [24]. The enhancement in the reducibility of lattice oxygens in cerium oxide in the presence of other transition metals (Pt, Rh, Pd, Au) is also well documented [34,39]. In the case of the impregnated chlorine-containing Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst, the data in Table 3 indicate a lower reduction degree of ruthenium at temperature below 200°C (H2 consumption 810μmol H2/g instead of 990μmol H2/g) as compared to that of the impregnated Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst. The difference between these two samples can be explained by assuming that some amount of ruthenium is stabilized in a cationic state by interaction with chloride ions present at the metal-support interface or at the surface of Ru particles [45]. The presence of residual chloride decreases not only reduction of Ru species, but also limits the spillover of hydrogen responsible for reduction of ceria. 3.3 Catalytic activity of Ru/CeO2 catalysts in oxidation of the mixture of C3-C4 alkanes The catalyst activities were evaluated through conversion versus temperature (light-off curves) and conversion versus time tests. The conversions of isobutane, n-butane and propane mixture over the unloaded CeO2 and Ru/CeO2 catalysts as a function of reaction temperature are presented in Fig. S6 (Supplementary material) and Fig. 4 , respectively. For all the samples CO2 and water were the only products detected under the applied reaction conditions. After the first cycle of the VOCs oxidation, the Ru catalyst sample was cooled down to room temperature and the second cycle was carried out under the same experimental conditions. The data in Figs. 4 and S6 clearly demonstrate that the presence of ruthenium improves the catalytic activity of pure CeO2 oxide towards complete oxidation of the mixture of the investigated light alkanes. Moreover, the contribution of the CeO2 support to the overall conversion over the Ru catalysts can be neglected, because the conversion of isoC4H10, n-C4H10 and C3H8 on the bare CeO2 did not exceed 1–2% in the temperature ranges where isobutane, n-butane and propane conversion over the Ru-catalysts reached 100%. For each VOC, the light-off curves of all the studied Ru/CeO2 catalysts are shifted to lower temperature with respect to that of the unloaded CeO2 sample. This behaviour can be seen better in the data presented in Table 4 , where the T50 and T95 conversion values (i.e. the temperature at which 50% or 95% conversion of a given alkane was reached) are compared. Moreover, as it can be seen from Figs. 4 and S6 and Table 4 the VOC reactivity order on all the studied samples is isobutane > n-butane > propane, indicating that it is more difficult to oxidize propane. This behaviour is in an agreement with the data reported by other authors, according to which the alkane oxidation rate on platinum (i.e. the most active metal for light alkane oxidation) rises with increasing the hydrocarbon chain length [46], and it is consistent with the concept that alkane oxidation is limited by the initial H abstraction, because the easiness of breaking the CH bond increases in the same order. Slightly higher activity of all the catalysts for isobutane oxidation as compared to that of n-butane can be explained by the weaker strength of the CH bonds of isobutane and/or by a higher reactivity of oxygen species with this compound. According to the literature data the apparent CH bond activation energy for isobutane is slightly lower than that for n-butane (11.3 and 11.5kcal/mol, respectively) [47]. Our catalytic data show that for all the alkanes, the activity is in the following order Ru(NPs)/CeO2 ≥Ru(N)/CeO2 ≫ Ru(Cl)/CeO2 ≫ CeO2. This trend in the catalytic performance is in an agreement with the trend in the redox properties of these catalysts (Fig. 3, Table 3). Namely, lower reduction temperature leads to lower T50 values in the catalytic tests. For the impregnated Ru catalysts in the first cycle, the characteristic T50 values are about 80°C lower for the Ru(N)/CeO2 sample (149, 152 and 158°C for iso- and n-butane and propane, respectively) than those for the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 sample (226, 233 and 240°C for iso- and n-butane and propane, respectively). Additionally, larger differences in T50 values for isobutane and propane occurred for the Ru(Cl) sample (14°C) as compared to Ru(N) sample (9°C), showing that oxidation of propane over the chlorine-containing catalyst is more difficult. The studied Ru catalysts have identical Ru loading (5wt.%), high BET surface area, and high ruthenium dispersion (HRTEM and XRD data), hence a poisoning effect of the residual chlorine precursors remaining on the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst could be one of the possible factors affecting the catalytic activity (EDS analysis, Table 1). We previously found that the presence of chloride in the Ru/Al2O3 samples (from RuCl3 precursor) diminishes the Ru activity in propane or butane oxidation acting as a poison [17,18]. The ceria supported Pt, Pd or Rh catalysts are also highly sensitive to the presence of chloride species, mainly after a reduction treatment at high temperature, due to formation of CeOCl species that inhibit availability of active lattice oxygen [4,5,9,11,12,48]. A higher catalytic activity of chlorinated catalysts, as compared to those of the Cl-free catalysts (for example Pt/CeO2/C in complete oxidation of ethanol) was reported only in a few papers [14]. Cl poisoning effect was frequently attributed to more difficult formation of oxygen vacancies [5] or the presence of chloride ions can dramatically reduce the oxygen-spillover and back-spillover rates by forming CeOCl species on the ceria support [49]. Formation of the CeOCl species lowers the number of available hydroxyl groups that were claimed to be one key parameter responsible for possible migration of chemisorbed oxygen species. Moreover, the adsorption capability of ruthenium could be inhibited, as ruthenium atoms at the metal-support interface could behave as partly oxidized (TPR study, Table 3). For the chlorine-free Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst the T50 and T95 values for the light alkane oxidation are slightly higher (by 8–10°C) or lower (by 8–19°C), respectively, than for the impregnated Ru(N) sample (Table 4). The small differences in the activity may indicate that the number of the active sites is similar for these chlorine-free samples. In the second cycle, the T50 and T95 values for the Ru(NPs) nano-catalyst were only slightly higher (3–5°C or 6–10°C, respectively) than in the first cycle, indicating a very good recycling potential of this sample in oxidation of light alkanes (Table 4). We previously found that Ru(NPs) deposited on γ-Al2O3 (prepared by the same microwave-assisted polyol method) with an average particle size of 1.6nm, were less active in propane oxidation (single pollutant test) with T50 =176°C in the first run and 185°C in the second run [50]. The impregnated Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst in the second cycle exhibited lower activity than that of the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst and larger differences in T50 and T95 values were observed (Table 4). It can be noticed that the catalytic performance of the Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst is also much better than that previously found for the 5% Ru(N)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in propane oxidation (single pollutant test, T50 =180°C and 218°C in the first and second run, respectively) [51]. Large differences in the reducibility of ruthenium oxide species supported over CeO2 (reduction peaks at 77 and 127°C, Fig. 3) as compared to those supported over nonreducible γ-alumina (177, 201 and 210°C) [51] should be partly responsible for the higher activity of the Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst. Additionally, the redox properties of CeO2, mainly related to the Ce+4/Ce+3, proved to increase the catalytic activity in the studied VOCs oxidation reactions. Recently, Avila et al. [52] also reported higher activity of propane combustion (single pollutant test) over Pt/CeO2 catalyst as compared to that of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The higher activity on Pt/CeO2 than on Pt/Al2O3 was interpreted by considering that combustion of C3H8 on Pt/CeO2 occurs not only on Pt0 sites, but also on perimeter Pt0-Ce3+ sites of the metal-support interface providing an additional oxidation pathway. Formation of dual Pt0-Ce3+ sites was favoured by the high reducibility showed by CeO2 in presence of Pt that generates a high concentration of surface Ce3+ sites [52]. The chlorine-containing Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited an interesting catalytic performance since it is more active in the second cycle than in the first one. Namely, in the second cycle the conversion increased more rapidly as the reaction temperature increased (Fig. 4C) and T50 values for all the alkanes are about 30°C lower (198, 202 and 210°C for iso- and n-butane and propane, respectively) than in the first cycle (226, 233 and 240°C for iso- and n-butane and propane, respectively), (Table 4). Better catalytic performance of the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 sample in the second cycle may be partly related to migration of chloride species from the ruthenium surface to the interface to form halogenated species with the support, thereby refreshing the metal surface, and to removal of residual chloride from ceria support during the VOCs oxidation reaction in oxygen-rich atmosphere. In fact, the EDS analysis revealed that the amount of chlorine species over the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst after the second cycle was significantly lower (1.2wt%) than that in the fresh reduced catalyst (11.6wt%, Table 1). We suppose that the chlorides are stripped off by their reaction with water vapour (generated from VOCs oxidation) to form HCl via a mechanism similar to that reported by Paulis et al. [53]. The formation of molecular chlorine Cl2 via Deacon reaction (4HCl+O2 ↔2Cl2 +2H2O) is less possible because ceria favours this reaction at higher temperature (300–400°C) [5]. While majority of the chlorine was removed from the Ru(Cl) catalyst its catalytic performance was still lower than that of the chlorine-free samples. We also performed the third cycle over the Ru(Cl) catalyst and the results are shown in Fig. S7 (Supplementary materials). The temperature for 50% conversion for all the VOCs oxidation increased by ∼10°C as compared to that in the second cycle, but much larger differences were observed for the T95 values (∼320°C in the third cycle, ∼260°C in the second cycle) indicating that further improvement in the catalytic performance was not observed. Tiernan and Finlayson [15] also found that the isobutane oxidation activity (single pollutant test) of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst − prepared from H2PtCl6 − was higher in the second run (T50 =230°C) as compared to the first run (T50 =285°C) and the authors explained this behaviour by removal of deactivating chloride species or by a change in the Pt particle morphology during reaction leading to the exposure of more active crystal faces. 3.3.1 Catalyst durability In order to investigate the influence of a preparation method and metal salt precursors on the long-term activity of the Ru/CeO2 samples, catalytic experiments were performed up to 50h. Although many studies are available on the VOCs combustion over the ceria supported metal catalysts, only a few of them concerned long-term testing. Fig. 5 shows n-butane conversion (in mixture of C3-C4) over the studied Ru catalysts as a function of time on stream at the temperature of 210°C. These catalytic data were obtained over the catalyst samples after the second cycle in order to demonstrate stability of the Ru phase. For the Ru(NPs) nano-catalyst, the initially high conversion of 96% dropped only to 93% after 50h time on stream, thereby indicating that this sample has a high stability under the used oxygen-rich reaction conditions. The very good catalytic performances (activity and stability) of the Ru(NPs) deposited on CeO2 could be attributed to an increased oxygen mobility and to an increased activity for the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple (TPR data), occurring as a consequence of formation of a large number of surface and/or bulk defects in the ceria support induced during the synthesis of the Ru(NPs) nano-catalyst by MW-assisted polyol method. A slightly larger drop of the n-butane conversion was observed for the impregnated Ru(N) catalyst (from 90% to 80%) and significantly greater for the impregnated chlorine-containing Ru(Cl) catalyst, i.e. from 70% to about 55% (Fig. 5). The results shown in Fig. 5 may indicate that the level of deactivation of the catalysts is also dependent on initial conversion. Therefore, we performed the additional durability test for the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst in the higher temperature (250°C) to provide its initial conversion on the similar level as for the Ru(NPs) and Ru(N) samples. As the result, it was found that the initially high conversion of 92% drops to 74% after 50h time on stream, thereby indicating the similar level of deactivation as was observed in the lower temperature. These data additionally confirm that deactivation of the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst is much higher than the chlorine-free samples. Dai et al. [32,33] also observed deactivation of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts during catalytic combustion of various chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs). The authors suggested that removal of chlorine species, generated from the decomposition of CHCs on the active sites, is a key step to improve stability of the catalysts. In order to clarify the reasons of some deactivation of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts we took into consideration: (i) changes of the textural properties of the samples during catalytic tests, and (ii) possible changes in the crystal structure of the catalysts. Therefore, the deactivated catalyst samples after the long-term activity tests were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption measurements and XRD technique. As it is shown in Table 2, for the used Ru(NPs) nano-catalyst the BET surface area, as well as total pore volume and mean pore diameter are nearly the same (SBET =43m2/g,Vp =0.09cm3/g, Dp =6.8nm) as before the catalytic tests (SBET =44m2/g,Vp =0.09cm3/g, Dp =6.8nm). However, for the used Ru(Cl) sample the BET surface area (46m2/g) was about 24% lower than before the catalytic tests (61m2/g). Moreover, the total pore volume and mean pore size (Vp =0.11cm3/g, Dp =5.9nm) were about 40% lower as compared to those of the fresh sample (Vp =0.18cm3/g, Dp =9.3nm). For the used Ru(N) sample slightly smaller changes in the textural properties were noticed (Table 2). Therefore, the observed some catalyst deactivation of the impregnated Ru/CeO2 catalysts may be partly explained by the changes in the textural properties of the samples during the long-term catalytic reaction. Usually, loss in the ceria surface area is associated with an increase in crystallite size and larger ceria crystallites are considered to be less reducible, it is possible that the decrease in combustion activity is associated with a change in the ceria reducibility. In fact, in the used impregnated catalysts, the mean crystallite size of CeO2 was slightly higher, 30–31nm, instead of 27–28nm as it was found for the fresh samples (Table 2). Significantly greater deactivation of the Ru(Cl) catalyst may also be partly caused by some agglomeration of the ruthenium phase, favoured by the support corrosion (chlorination). The literature data show that agglomerated Ru oxide species on ceria are more difficult to reduce [25]. In accord with this, Aouad et al. [43] found that agglomerated ruthenium oxide species supported on ceria are less reactive in reactions such as oxidation of propylene or toluene. Hokosawa et al. [44] reported that in the case of the Ru/CeO2 catalyst (prepared from RuCl3), small segregation of RuO2 on CeO2 occurred at the calcination temperature of 500°C and thus, they concluded that the upper limit of calcination temperature or reaction temperature in oxidizing conditions should be <500°C. Below this temperature Ru is highly dispersed and forms mainly RuOCe bonds [44]. According to Homsi et al. [29] RuOCe bonds in the well dispersed Ru species over the ceria surface are highly fragile and its mobile oxygen is reactive in oxidation reactions. In our case, agglomeration of oxidized Ru species should be rather small since the reaction temperature used in this work (up to maximum 320°C, Fig. S7) was much lower than 500°C. The XRD patterns of the used Ru/CeO2 catalysts (not shown) were very similar to those before the catalytic reaction (Fig. 1) and peaks ascribed to crystalline RuO2 oxide at 2Θ of 35.3° and 54.5°, which are the second and the third strongest peaks of RuO2, were not observed. However, the strongest peak at 2Θ of 28.1° may be superimposed with the CeO2 peak. The absence of those peaks may suggest that Ru in all the used Ru/CeO2 samples is present as a highly dispersed RuOCe phase or as small RuO2 crystallites, which are not large enough for XRD detection (size below 2–3nm). It should be noticed that RuOCe interactions are different from those in the Ru-O-Al since, as we reported previously, in the used Ru/γ-Al3O3 catalysts in propane or butane combustion [17,18,51], characteristic reflections corresponding to RuO2 oxide were always observed by XRD. In order to find possible structural changes of the ruthenium phase at temperature higher than that used under catalytic reactions, the reduced Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst was calcined in air at 400°C for 1 or 5h and at 600°C for 5h. After calcination at 400°C, the XRD patterns of this sample (Fig. S8, Supplementary material) show only reflections from the ceria support. The first sign of the Ru agglomeration was observed after calcination at 600°C for 5h, when very small reflection assigned to (101) RuO2 appeared at 2Θ of 35.3°. This means that under the reaction conditions used in this study, ruthenium oxide species were well-dispersed at the surface of CeO2 so they were not detected by XRD. In summary, the observation made on the basis of XRD and HRTEM analysis indicates that all the synthesized Ru/CeO2 catalysts after hydrogen reduction treatment (regardless of the used precursor) consist of very small metal nanoparticles finely dispersed over the ceria support. According to the XRD data on the used Ru/CeO2 catalysts this characteristic is also maintained after combustion tests, indicating a good stability, especially of the chlorine-free samples under investigation. On the basis of the literature data [20,22,29,44] and the results of this study, under oxygen-rich reaction conditions a strong interaction between oxidized Ru and CeO2, involving formation of a RuOCe bond that stabilizes Ru phase against sintering, occurs. Therefore, CeO2 is a good support for stabilization of small Ru particles against sintering, whereas Ru easily agglomerates on Al2O3 under an oxidative atmosphere already at the temperature of 250°C [17,18]. It is important that the results of this study evidence for the first time a possibility of preparing a chlorine-free Ru NPs deposited on CeO2 using the microwave-assisted polyol method and RuCl3 as a metal precursor (easy accessible and cheaper than Cl-free precursors). This nano-catalyst exhibited a very good catalytic activity and stability during the course of combustion of the C3-C4 mixture. The reducibility of the ceria surface as well as oxidized Ru species in the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst was much better as compared to that in the impregnated Ru catalysts, especially those containing chlorine ions. We suppose that highly dispersed small Ru NPs are capable of more significant weakening of the CeO bonds adjacent to the Ru atom and consequently, increase mobility of lattice oxygen involved in VOCs oxidation through Mars-van Krevelen reaction mechanism [54]. The mechanism of VOC oxidation reactions over ceria and ceria-based catalysts is generally considered to be a redox type mechanism, i.e. Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism, in which ceria supplies oxygen to the reaction and it is re-oxidized by gas phase oxygen [3,5,25,54]. The presence of chlorine on the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst inhibits active lattice oxygen availability, which causes lower activity of this catalyst. This blocking effect probably depends on the amount of chlorine present on the ceria support as it was suggested by Bernal et al. [9]. 4 Conclusions Catalytic combustion of C3-C4 mixture was investigated on Ru/CeO2 catalysts prepared by microwave-assisted polyol method or by incipient wetness impregnation method and by using chlorine- and chlorine-free metal precursors. All the prepared catalysts have high ruthenium dispersion. The presence of ruthenium enhances the activity of cerium oxide towards oxidation of C3-C4 mixture and the extent of this effect depends on the preparation method of the ruthenium catalysts. Catalytic tests showed that the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst, prepared by microwave-assisted polyol method, exhibited a much better catalytic performance (activity and stability) in the oxidation of C3 C4 mixture, compared to that of the impregnated Ru(N) and Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalysts. The Ru(NPs) nano-catalyst was Cl-free although it was prepared from RuCl3, showed better reduction of oxidized Ru species, as well as better Ce4+/Ce3+ reduction of the CeO2 surface among all the catalysts. A considerable contamination of small Ru particles and presence of chlorine species on the ceria support results in lowering catalytic performance of the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 sample.

        "dc:description": "Two preparation methods and two metal salt precursors (chlorine containing and chlorine-free) were used to synthesize Ru/CeO2 catalysts and their catalytic behaviour has been evaluated in combustion of propane, n-butane and isobutane mixture. In the first method, Ru nanoparticles (Ru NPs) deposited on CeO2 were synthesized by a microwave-assisted polyol method using RuCl3 as a metal precursor and ethylene glycol as a reducing agent. In the second, Ru/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by traditional incipient wetness impregnation method using RuCl3 or Ru(NO)(NO3)3. ICP-AES, N2 adsorption-desorption, H2-TPR, XRD, HRTEM and SEM-EDS techniques were used to characterize the catalysts. In all the Ru/CeO2 catalysts only highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles (1–2nm) were present. The catalytic data show that the preparation method and the nature of the metal precursor have a significant influence on catalytic performance of the Ru/CeO2 catalysts. The VOC reactivity order (iso-butane > n-butane > propane) show that propane is the most difficult to oxidize. The Ru(NPs)/CeO2 and impregnated Ru(N)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited much higher activity and stability than that of impregnated Ru(Cl)/CeO2. It was found that the Ru(NPs)/CeO2 nano-catalyst was free of chlorine species although it had been prepared from RuCl3. The differences in the activity have been ascribed to the presence of Cl− ions on the Ru(Cl)/CeO2 catalyst and to much better reducibility of the chlorine-free Ru(NPs) and Ru(N) catalysts. The Cl species have a negative impact on the redox properties of CeO2, they have some influence on Ru agglomeration during long-term activity tests (50h), and consequently, the chlorinated catalyst exhibited a poorer activity and stability compared with those of the Cl-free catalysts.",
