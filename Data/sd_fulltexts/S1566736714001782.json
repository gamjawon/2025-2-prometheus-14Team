In this composite, α-MnO2 nanoparticles are embedded in an MIL-101(Cr) matrix with abundant micropores and a high specific surface area, which improves the reactant's accessibility to catalytically active sites, resulting in a significant improvement in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. The strong interactions between α-MnO2 nanoparticles and MIL-101(Cr) matrix result in a high structural stability and therefore excellent activity stability. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Oxygen evolution reaction Hydrothermal process Composite Metal-organic frameworks Manganese dioxide 1 Introduction In recent years, rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their extremely high theoretical specific energy and the solubility of discharge product in water [1,2]. However, the ORR during discharging and the OER during charging are sluggish [3,4], resulting in a large gap between the charging and discharging voltages, which significantly decreases the round-trip efficiency and cycle life of rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries. Therefore, it is vital to develop an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst to accelerate both ORR and OER, thus reducing the cell polarisation and improving the performance of rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries. Great effort has been made to develop bifunctional catalysts for application in rechargeable lithium–air batteries over the past few years. The PtAu/C catalyst [5] and the mesoporous α-MnO2/Pd catalyst [6] strongly enhanced the kinetics of the ORR and OER. However, Pt, Pd and Au are expensive and therefore unpractical for the large-scale commercialisation of rechargeable lithium–air batteries. Therefore, considerable effort has been expended to develop non-noble bifunctional catalysts for practical use. Manganese oxides (MnOx) have recently drawn increased attention, as certain MnOx phases have exhibited good catalytic activity for both ORR and OER [3,7–9]. In addition, Mn is several orders of magnitude less costly than precious metals and is environmentally friendly. Although great improvements have been made in the use of MnOx to synthesise bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER, the catalytic performance of MnOx-based catalysts needs to be further improved for application in rechargeable lithium–air batteries [9,10]. New strategies must be developed to synthesise effective bifunctional catalysts based on MnOx for rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently shown promising applications in gas separation/storage [11,12] and catalysis [13] due to their extremely high specific surface area and tuneable pore structure as well as multiple coordination sites. It has been reported that the embedding of redox-active species in an MOF matrix [14] or the encapsulation of dense inorganic species, such as metals [15] and oxides [16], in MOF layers can significantly improve their performance. However, to our knowledge, MOFs have not yet to be used to fabricate nano-structural bifunctional catalysts with MnOx for ORR and OER. Herein, we synthesised an α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) composite catalyst using a hydrothermal process. This composite exhibits excellent activity and stability for ORR and OER in an alkaline electrolyte. This work may offer a new route to design and develop non-precious bifunctional ORR and OER catalysts based on MOFs for applications in rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) sample The MIL-101(Cr) (Cr3F(H2O)2O[(O2C)–C6H4–(CO2)]3·nH2O (where n is ~25)) sample was synthesised using the procedure described elsewhere [17] with some modifications (see the Supplementary data). The synthesis procedure of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) sample was as follows. First, MnSO4·H2O (0.1843g) and MIL-101(Cr) (0.5g) were added to deionised water (10mL) under stirring. Next, KMnO4 (0.115g) was dissolved in deionised water (10mL) separately. After stirring for 30min, the resulting KMnO4 solution was added dropwise into the first mixture under stirring and kept at room temperature for 30min. The resulting mixture was then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, which was sealed, heated to 160°C in an oven and kept at 160°C under autogenous pressure for 8h. After naturally cooling, the mixture was filtered and washed several times using deionised water and then dried at 120°C overnight. Finally, an α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) sample with a calculated Mn loading of 20wt.% on MIL-101(Cr) was obtained. The pure α-MnO2 was also synthesised for comparison by the same procedure with the MIL-101(Cr) powder excluded. 2.2 Characterisations X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a D/max 2500 PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on an ASAP2010C instrument, and the specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. 2.3 Electrochemical measurements The working electrode was prepared on carbon paper (TGP-H-120, Toray) as follows. First, 5mg of α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) or α-MnO2 sample and 2mg of carbon black (Super P) were added to a mixture of 1mL of ethanol and 70μL of Nafion solution (5wt.%, DuPont). After ultrasonication for 30min, a homogeneous ink was obtained. A 50-μL aliquot of the ink was dropped on carbon paper with a geometric area of 1cm2 and then dried at 80°C in air. Electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1M KOH aqueous solution using a three-electrode cell at room temperature. A Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl aqueous solution were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode potential was controlled using a potentiostat (CHI 760E, Chenhua, China). Before the ORR measurements, oxidation and reduction cycles were performed in the range of −1–0.2V vs. Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 50mVs−1 with bubbling N2 to achieve a stable cyclic voltammogram profile. The electrochemical activity for the ORR was determined from the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) at −1–0.2V vs. Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 5mVs−1. The ORR current was corrected for the background current, which was obtained in a N2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte. The OER current was tested in a N2-saturated electrolyte solution from 0.2 to 1V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 5mVs−1. For comparison, the ORR and OER activities of 20wt.% Pt/C (E-TEK) were tested under the same conditions. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were carried out using a glassy carbon disk electrode with a 5.0-mm diameter. A catalyst layer was deposited by dropping 6μL of the catalyst ink on the disk electrode surface followed by drying at room temperature. Linear sweep curves at a sweep rate of 5mVs−1 were obtained at 100, 400, 900, 1600 and 2500rpm in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte and corrected for the background current in N2-saturated 0.1M KOH electrolyte. The 20,000s ORR activity stability was investigated by chronoamperometry with the potential of −0.4V at 1600rpm in the RDE configuration. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TEM, XRD and N2 adsorption–desorption characterizations of the samples Fig. 1 presents TEM images of the MIL-101(Cr) and the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) samples. In the MIL-101(Cr) sample, the particles are irregular in shape and 300–600nm in size. In the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, some black and dark grey particles, 5–50nm in diameter, are observed, which are regarded as α-MnO2 nanoparticles. These α-MnO2 nanoparticles are embedded in the MIL-101(Cr) matrix; that is, the α-MnO2 nanoparticles are closely surrounded by the porous MIL-101(Cr) matrix, and an α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) composite is formed, suggesting strong interactions between the α-MnO2 nanoparticles and the MIL-101(Cr) matrix in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. To investigate the structural stability of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, this catalyst was immersed in deionised water for 40h at room temperature and then dried (this sample is denoted as α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40), and a TEM image of this sample is shown in Fig. 1C. After 40h of immersion in deionised water, the α-MnO2 nanoparticles remained closely surrounded by the porous MIL-101(Cr) matrix, indicating that the structure is maintained due to the interactions between the α-MnO2 nanoparticles and the MIL-101(Cr) matrix. The XRD patterns of the MIL-101(Cr), α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) and α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 samples are shown in Fig. 2A-B. The MIL-101(Cr) exhibits an excellent crystalline structure, which is consist with the crystalline structure of MIL-101(Cr) prepared by Férey et al. [17]. For the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, the crystalline structure remains intact, indicating that the crystalline structure of MIL-101(Cr) is not destroyed after α-MnO2 nanoparticles are imbedded into the MIL-101(Cr) matrix. In addition, diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ of approximately 29°, 38°, 42° and 57° for the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. These peaks are assigned to α-MnO2, suggesting that α-MnO2 is formed during the preparation of the composite. As shown in Fig. 2B, although the crystalline structure of MIL-101(Cr) in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst is not destroyed, there is a shift of the diffraction peaks of the MIL-101(Cr) in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst to higher degrees compared with those of pure MIL-101(Cr). Moreover, the intensities of the peaks corresponding to MIL-101(Cr) in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst are weaker than those in pure MIL-101(Cr). These results indicate that there is a strong interaction between the α-MnO2 nanoparticles and MIL-101(Cr) matrix in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, resulting in a change in the lattice parameters of the catalyst. Compared with the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, there is almost no change in either the position or the intensity of the diffraction peaks in the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 sample. This finding indicates that the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst exhibits excellent structural stability, which is likely related to the interaction between α-MnO2 and the MIL-101(Cr) matrix. Fig. 2C shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MIL-101(Cr), α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) and α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 samples. The three samples exhibit a type I isotherm, and their average pore sizes are less than 2nm (Fig. 2D), indicating the predominant microporous character of the samples. The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the samples are as follows: MIL-101(Cr), 1767m2/g, 0.91cm3/g and 1.19 (1.73) nm; α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr), 1279m2/g, 0.67cm3/g and 1.28 (1.79) nm; and α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40, 1347m2/g, 0.68cm3/g and 1.31 (1.80) nm, respectively. The insertion of α-MnO2 into the MIL-101(Cr) matrix results in a significant decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume and a slight increase in pore size. This finding indicates that the imbedding of α-MnO2 into the MIL-101(Cr) matrix affects the porous structure of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. It can be noted that the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 sample are almost identical to those of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, indicating that this composite catalyst has an excellent structural stability. 3.2 Bifunctional catalytic activity for ORR and OER of the samples The ORR activity of the MIL-101(Cr) sample, the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40, and 20wt.% Pt/C in 0.1M KOH solution is presented in Fig. 3A–B. For comparison, the ORR activity of the as-prepared α-MnO2 was also tested. The ORR onset potential is defined as the potential at which the current density reaches −2μAcm−2. All potentials discussed in this article are relative to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. α-MnO2 shows some ORR activity; the ORR onset potential is −0.14V (Fig. 3B), and the current density at −0.3V is −1.31mAcm−2. The ORR activity of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst is markedly enhanced compared with the α-MnO2. The ORR onset potential is −0.07V (Fig. 3B), which is lower than 20wt.% Pt/C but is 70mV higher than that of the α-MnO2 sample, and the current density at −0.3V is −9.48mAcm−2, which is more than 7 times higher than that of the α-MnO2 sample at the same potential. Furthermore, the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 sample shows almost the same ORR activity as then α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, with an onset potential of −0.08V (Fig. 3B) and a current density at −0.3V of −9.54mAcm−2. These results indicate that the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst exhibits high ORR activity stability after the catalyst is immersed in deionised water for 40h. It is likely that the high structure stability of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst resulting from the interaction between the MnO2 nanoparticles and the MIL-101(Cr) matrix is responsible for its excellent ORR activity stability. To investigate the electron transfer kinetics of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst, the reaction kinetics was tested using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). As shown in Fig. 4A, the current density increases with increasing rotation rates from 100 to 2500rpm in an oxygen-saturated 0.1M KOH solution. Two regions of potential-current responses are observed, suggesting that the ORR for this catalyst occurs via two reaction pathways. Fig. 4B shows the corresponding Koutecky–Levich plots at different potentials for the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. Although the Levich slopes at the applied potentials are linear, the Levich slopes change little with changes in the potential, making it difficult to determine the ORR pathway at applied potentials for the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. The number of electrons transferred for each oxygen molecule (n) in ORR was obtained by the Koutecky–Levich equation [18] (see the Supplementary data), and shown in Fig. 4C. The n is always ~3.75 at potentials from −0.35 to −0.1V, suggesting that the ORR catalysed by α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) sample can occur via a two- and four-electron hybrid pathway, but mainly via a four-electron pathway to produce water directly. Fig. 4(D) shows i–t curve of α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) with the potential of −0.4V under 1600rpm. The curve decays slowly and stabilizes with the ORR current density retention of 94.8% after 5000s and 80.9% after 20,000s, indicating an excellent stability. Fig. 5 shows the OER activity of the MIL-101(Cr), α-MnO2, α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr), α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 and 20wt.% Pt/C samples. MIL-101(Cr) shows very low OER activity, and the current density at 0.9V is 0.54mAcm−2. Compared with MIL-101(Cr), α-MnO2 and 20wt.% Pt/C, the OER activity of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst increases markedly. There is an obvious current at 0.5V, which then the current increases sharply with increasing potential. The current density reaches 23.67mAcm−2 at 0.9V, which is 2 times more than that of the α-MnO2 sample at the same potential. The current density at 0.9V of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr)-40 catalyst is 22.84mAcm−2, and there is a very small decrease in the OER activity compared with the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst. This finding indicates that the catalyst also exhibits excellent OER activity stability after immersion into deionised water for 40h. The strong interaction between α-MnO2 nanoparticles and MOF matrix results in the excellent structural stability of the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr), which is responsible for the OER activity stability. It has been reported that nano-structural α-MnO2 showed excellent ORR activity in alkaline electrolyte [19,20]. In addition, the oxygen-vacancy-bearing MnOx favours OER and ORR catalysis [10]. In the α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) composite, the abundant micropores of the MIL-101(Cr) matrix surrounding the α-MnO2 nanoparticles improve the reactant's accessibility to catalytically active sites, which are responsible for the catalyst's excellent bifunctional activity for ORR and OER. 4 Conclusions We synthesised an α-MnO2/MIL-101(Cr) composite catalyst using a hydrothermal process. In this catalyst, α-MnO2 nanoparticles are embedded in an MIL-101(Cr) matrix, and the resulting catalyst has a good crystalline structure with abundant micropores and a high specific surface area. The composite exhibits considerable catalytic activity for OER and ORR, and a four-electron pathway is dominant for ORR in alkaline electrolyte. This catalyst shows markedly high activity stability for ORR and OER in alkaline solution. The composite is an active and stable bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER, indicating that it is a potential non-precious metal bifunctional catalyst for use in rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries.
