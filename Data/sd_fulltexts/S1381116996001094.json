UnicersitParis V, 45 Rue des Saints-Pes, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France Received 29 January 1996; revised 20 March 1996 Abstract New supported Mnltt-porphyrin-based catalysts were prepared by covalent binding of meso-tetrakis-(2,6-dichlorophenyl) porphyrin derivatives bearing NHZ or S03H functions on their meso-aryl rings to either silica or montmorillonite K10. All these supported metalloporphyrins efficiently catalysed the epoxidation of alkenes with PhIO. The MnItt-porphyrin covalently bound to montmorillonite K10 gave remarkably good results for the hydroxylation of linear alkanes such as heptane with PhIO, the obtained yields (54%) being much better than those observed with corresponding homogeneous catalysts. The Mnl\"-porphyrin covalently bound to silica was an efficient catalyst for epoxidation of alkenes with H202 (yields between 65 and 95% under conversion conditions). In the presence of an excess of substrate, this supported catalyst was found to be able to catalyse alkene epoxidation with yields based on HZOZ between 67% and 88%, as well as alkane hydroxylation with yields between 21 % (for heptane) and 90% (for cyclooctane).

Introduction Several systems based on Fe\"'- and Mnlllporphyrins that are able to mimic cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases have been reported during these last fifteen years (For reviews see Ref. [1]). In order to construct systems useful for selective oxidation in organic chemistry, it would be particularly interesting to associate H202, an inexpensive, readily available oxidant which should give H20 as the only \" Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PHS1381-1169(96)00109-4 by-product and a supported metalloporphyrin catalyst easier to handle and to recycle than corresponding homogeneous catalysts. However, the use of H202 in the presence of Fellland MnIn-porphyrins leads to several problems linked to the easy dismutation of H202 by these metalloporphyrins and the fast destruction of these catalysts by Hz02 and/or -OH. This is presumably why only few systems efficient for metalloporphyrin-catalysed oxidation of alkanes with H202 have been reported in literature. Fell'-porphyrins bearing many electronwithdrawing substituents catalyse alkene epoxidation by Hz02 in good yields, in the absence 344 M.A. Martinez-Lorente et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 343-353 of any cocatalyst [2], but they appear as ineffective catalysts for alkane hydroxylation by Hz02. On the contrary, several systems based on MnIII-porphyrins have been shown to be able to perform both alkene epoxidation and alkane hydroxylation by H202, provided that a cocatalyst is used to facilitate the heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of H20z. Most of these systems use the robust catalyst Mn(TDCPP)Cl [H ZTDCPP = meso-tetrakis-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)porphyrin] and either a nitrogenous base such as imidazole [3], an imidazole and a carboxylic acid such as benzoic acid [4], a soluble base and a tertiary amine-N-oxide [5], or simply ammonium acetate [6], as cocatalysts. The role of the cocatalyst in such systems is to facilitate the formation of the active oxygen species of the Mnv=O type from reaction of Mull, with H202. It may be involved in several steps of this reaction [3,4]. In the removal of a proton from HZOZ before formation of intermediate MnIn-OOH, it should act as a base. In order to facilitate the heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of this intermediate, it may act as a Mnligand in trans position of the OOH ligand; moreover, its acid conjugate may protonate the appropriate oxygen atom of MnI`-OOH which is necessary for the departure of HZO as a leaving group [3]. Finally, in the particular case of ammonium acetate or benzoic acid in the presence of imidazole, it could catalyse the formation of Mnv=O via a MnIII-OOCOR species in which the heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond should be much easier [4]. In the presence of HZO2, the use of a supported metalloporphyrin catalyst instead of an homogeneous one, leads to supplementary problems related to a possible oxidative degradation of the support in the case of organic polymer supports, or to a possible dismutation of H202 by the support in the case of inorganic supports. All these considerations would explain why only very few systems based on supported metalloporphyrin catalysts and HZOZ have been reported for the oxidation of alkenes and alkanes This paper describes the preparation of two supported catalysts obtained by covalent binding of two derivatives of Mn(TDCPP) either to montmorillonite or to silica. One of them gives particularly good results in the hydroxylation of linear alkanes by PhIO, whereas the second one is efficient for the epoxidation of alkenes and hydroxylation of alkanes by H202 itself. 2. Results 2.1. Preparation of metalloporphyrins bearing appropriate functions Two inorganic supports were used in this study. The first one was silica bearing a carboxylic acid function; it was covalently bound to a TDCPPHZ derivative bearing an amine function. The second one was montmorillonite K10. This material was functionalised with a -(CHZ)3 NHZ group and covalently bound to a TDCPPHZ derivative involving a SOZCI function. 2.1.1. Preparation of silica-bound catalysts 6 and 7 (Fig. 1) Porphyrin 2, TDCmN02PPH21 was prepared by condensation of stoichiometric amounts of 2,6-dichloro-3-nitrobenzaldehyde, 1, and pyrrole according to a previously described procedure [8]. Reduction of the nitro groups with SnClz at 70 followed by metallation with Mn(OAc)2 afforded MnI'I(TDCmNHZPP)OAc, 4, in very good yields. Complex 4 was covalently bound to silica CBA bearing-CHZCOOH groups, after activation of their COOH functions upon treatment with thionyl chloride. After formation of the amide bonds (CH3CN at reflux), the insoluble material obtained, 6, was washed with CHZC12, CH3CN, then extensively extracted with acetone in a Soxhlet system and dried at 80 for 24 h. Finally, supported catalyst 7 was obtained after acetylation of the residual NHZ functions of the metalloporphyrin in order to avoid any secondary reactions at the M.A. Martinet-Gorente et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 343-353 ci CHO +pyrrole (1) CH,Cl,,BF,.Et,O O,N CI ci ci - \\a M~u CH,COHN ci cl ci 3 H,N ci o- Ci NH-CO- CH,COCI Pyridine CI CI M ~ ~ O-vc 3 CH,COHN CI Fig. 1.

The UV-vis. spectra of 6 and 7 were similar to those of 4, with a Soret peak at 474 nm, indicating that no demetallation has occurred during the preparation and that the porphyrin ring was not modified. Elemental analysis of Mn showed that compounds 6 and 7, respectively contained 6.6% and 2.6% (m/m) of Mnporphyrin. 2.1.2. Preparation of montmorillonite-bound catalyst 11 (Fig. 2) The precursor Mnitt-porphyrin 10 was prepared by treatment of the previously described [ 14] complex 9 with PC15 at 150 and extraction of the resulting paste with CHZCIz. Then 10 was made to react in refluxing pyridine with a clay, montmorillonite K10 bearing -(CH z ) 3NH 2 functions, which has been pre- 345 pared by reaction of commercially available montmorillonite K10 with aminopropyltriethoxy-silane according to a previously described procedure [15]. Extensive washing of the resulting solid with several solvents as for compounds 6 and 7 afforded the supported catalyst 11 which contained 3.5% (m/m) Mnporphyrin and exhibited a UV-vis. spectrum very similar to those of compounds 6 and 7. The homogeneous catalyst 12 equivalent to 11 was prepared by treatment of complex 10 with propylamine in refluxing pyridine (Fig. 2). 2.2. Catalytic properties of 6, 7 and 11 2.2.1. Oxidations with Ph10 Epoxidation of cyclooctene with PhIO, an easy oxidation, was first studied in order to have an idea of the accessibility of the Mnt'r centres of the supported catalysts towards substrates and oxidants.

Such high yields were also observed with supported catalyst 7 (88%) whereas they were markedly lower with catalyst 6 containing free and potentially reactive NHZ functions. Finally, the Mnln-porphyrin bound to montmorillonite, 11, was highly active and led to an almost quantitative epoxidation of cyclooctene Hydroxylation of linear alkanes such as heptane is a much more difficult reaction [1]. This is shown by the low yields that were observed for heptane hydroxylation with PhIO in the presence of catalysts 5 and 9 (21 % and 10%, respectively, Table 2). Interestingly, supported catalysts 7 and 11 gave much better results, the 54% yield obtained with 11 being quite remarkable for such a difficult reaction. It is noteworthy that this good overall oxidation yield was accompanied with a heptanols:heptanones ratio remarkably higher than those observed with the other catalysts (13 instead of 2-4). Another difference between supported catalysts 7 and 11 and their homogeneous analogues 5 and 9 concerns the regioselectivity of heptane hydroxylation. The regioselectivity observed with homogeneous catalysts 5 and 9 is very much in favour of hydroxylation at position 2 (mean value of 5:63:22:10 for the ratio of the oxidation products on positions 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, Table 2). Such a regioselectivity has been reported previously for metalloporphyrins of the TDCPP series. It has been explained by a restricted access of heptane to the high-valent metal-oxo species due to the bulky ortho-chloro substituents of the porphyrin meso-aryl groups [1]. The regioselectivity obtained with the two supported catalysts 7 and 11 was slightly but significantly different; it was less in favour of heptane hydroxylation at position 2 (mean value of 4:52:30:14 for the regioselectivity index). This phenomenon is not easy to explain; it would correspond to a less restricted access to the metal-oxo species in the supported catalysts. This could be caused by a different position of Table 2 Hydroxylation of heptane by PhIO catalyzed by homogeneous and supported Mn-porphyrins a Catalyst Total yield b Alcohols yield ` Ketones yield a Alcohols/ Regioselectivity a (%) (%) (%) (%) ketones ratio 1 2 3 4 Mn(TDCSPP) 9 10 6 2 3 4 62 22 12 Mn(TDCSPP)11 54 47 3.5 13.4 5 51 30 14 ~ K10 Mn(TDCmNHCOCH3PP)CI 5 21 11 5 2.2 6 65 21 8 /~ Mn(TDC-mNHCOCH3PP~ Si02 7 36 24 6 4 3 53 30 13 a Conditions: ratio of catalyst: PhIO: alkane = 1:20:800; concentration of soluble catalyst: 1.5 mM or eq. of supported Mn-porphyrin = 1.5 wmol in 1 ml CH3CN:CHZCI2 (2:1) at 20 under argon.

Oxidations with H202 In the presence of either imidazole or ammonium acetate, the Mnlll complexes 4 and 5 catalysed the epoxidation of cyclooctene (in large excess) with diluted HZO2 in yields between 60 and 80% (based on HZO2) (Table 3).

It is noteworthy that, when pyridine was used as a cocatalyst instead of imidazole or ammonium acetate, the epoxide yield obtained with 7 was much higher than that obtained with 5 (62% instead of 18%). Therefore, catalyst 7 was used in the following studies on alkene and alkane oxidations. Data of Table 4 allow one to compare the efficacy of the system to convert alkenes of different reactivity into the corresponding epoxides. They show results obtained upon progressive additions of H 202 to an alkene: CH 3COONH4: 7 mixture (40:100:1 molar ratio) in CH3CN:CH2C12 (2:1), until complete alkene conversion. Complete conversion of cyclooctene occurred after addition of only 2 eq. of HZOz to that system, the cyclooctene oxide yield being 91%. Complete conversion of cyclohexene and non-l-ene occurred after addition of 4 eq. of HZO2, and led to epoxide yields of 95%. Under identical conditions, cis-stilbene was oxidized to a 97:3 mixture of the corresponding cis and trans epoxides with an overall yield of 65%. The necessary consumption of 4 eq. of Hz02 for complete conversion of cyclohexene, non-l-ene and cis-stilbene, corresponding to a low selectivity towards H202 (25%), could be due to the well-known `catalase-like' reaction in which the (porphyrin) Mnv=O species reacts with H202 with formation of Oz and H20 [1]. In the case of supported catalyst 7, one cannot exclude that H202 could also be consumed by secondary reactions with metal ions possibly present in montmorillonite K10. The same system oxidized cyclooctane to cyclooctanol and cyclooctanone in yields of 26% and 10% after addition of 3 eq. of H202 (Table 4). Under identical conditions, adamantane was oxidized to adamantan-l-of and -2-of (respective yields of 34% and 12%). In the case of the less reactive alkanes, cyclohexane and heptane, lower yields were obtained (20% and 7%, respectively) even after addition of 5 eq. of H202 (Table 4). During the course of this study, it was found Table 5 Oxidation of alkenes and alkanes by H202 catalyzed by compound 7 in the presence of CH3COONH4, using an excess of substrate vs. H202 a Substrate Products Yield b Total yield ` Cyclooctene Cyclohexene ` non-l-ene Cyclooctane Cyclohexane heptane adamantane epoxide epoxide epoxide of one of one ols d ones 1-01 2-01 -one 72 9 48 7 15 3 44 12 88 75 67 90 62 21 56 a Conditions: ratio of catalyst: H202: CH3COONH4: substrate = 1:20:100:800; eq. of supported Mn-porphyrin = 1 wmol in 1 ml CH 3CN:CHZCl2 (2:1) at room temperature under aerobic conditions. b Yields based on starting HZOZ after 2 h. ` Total yields calculated by assuming that 1 and 2 mol of Hz02 were used for alcohol and ketone formation, respectively. d %Regioisomers at positions 1, 2, 3, 4 = 3:60:25:12. that an increase of the cocatalyst (CH 3COONH4):catalyst ratio from 10 to 100 led to a dramatic increase of the oxidation yields. Table 5 shows that oxidation of hydrocarbon substrates in large excess with H202 in the presence of CH3COONH4 and 7 (hydrocarbon: HZOz: CH3COONH4: 7 molar ratio = 800:20:100:1) led to good yields of oxidized products relative to HZOZ. Cyclooctene, cyclohexene and non-l-ene were epoxidised with yields between 67% and 88%, and cyclooctane, cyclohexane and adamantane were hydroxylated with yields between 56% and 90%. These results are quite remarkable as they show that there is only a slight loss of H202, by dismutation for instance, in these reactions using a Mntn-porphyrin bound to an inorganic support. Only in the case of the poorly reactive alkane, heptane, was the yield much lower (21%), indicating an increasing contribution of secondary reactions consuming H202.

Fig. 3 shows a linear formation of cyclooctene oxide as a function of the amount of H202 added (up to 800 eq.). After addition of 800 eq. of H20z (relative to 7), 50% of starting cyclooctene was oxidized to the corresponding epoxide. Further additions of H,,Oz did not increase epoxide formation presumably because of a great decrease of the amounts of cyclooctene and possible inactivation of the catalyst. However, after filtration, washing with acetone and drying (at 80) of the catalyst, epoxidation of cyclooctene under identical conditions occurred with identical rates and yields. 3. Conclusion The two supported catalysts, 7 and 11, which were prepared by covalent binding of Mn(TDCPP) derivatives to either silica or mont- 349 morillonite, exhibited different behaviours as catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation. Compound 11 was a remarkable catalyst for the hydroxylation of linear alkanes such as heptane with PhIO; it gave higher yields (54%) than corresponding homogeneous catalysts and supported catalyst 7. However, 11 was a poor catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation with H202. When using this oxidant, 7 appeared as a good catalyst slightly more efficient than corresponding homogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of alkenes with H202. Interestingly, supported catalyst 7 was able to transfer an oxygen atom form H20z to a substrate (used in excess) with yields (based on H202) between 65 and 95% in the case of alkenes, and between 21 % to 90% in the case of alkanes. This result is interesting as it shows that it is possible to build up metalloporphyrin-based supported catalysts for alkene and alkane oxidation with H202, not leading to an important non-productive H202 decomposition. Epoxidation of alkenes and hydroxylation of alkanes by H20z have been performed under similar conditions (temperature between 20 and 100) in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts such as titanosilicates [16]. Further studies are necessary to compare the respective advantages and drawbacks of the two systems, i.e., supported metalloporphyrins such as 7 and redox molecular sieves or metal complexes encapsulated in molecular sieves [16]. In that respect, one of the main interest of supported Fell'- or Mntn-porphyrins remains their oxidation mechanisms which closely mimic cytochrome P450dependent enzymes. 4. Materials and methods 4.1. Physical measurements UV-vis. spectra of M01-porphyrins were recorded on a GARY 210 spectrophotometer. For the supported Mntti-porphyrins a Beckman 350 M.A. Martinez-Lorente et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 343-353 5270 spectrophotometer was used. Microanalyses were carried out by the Service de Microanalyses du CNRS (Vernaison, France). Mass spectra of metalloporphyrins were performed on a Ribermag apparatus at the Ecole Normale Supieure de Paris. Gas chromatography analyses were carried out using an Intersmat IG 120FL chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The glass column (length 3 m, internal diameter 3 mm) was packed with 10% FFAP on chromosorb WAW (80/100 mesh). The products formed were analyzed by comparison of their retention time with those of authentic samples. Yields were determined by using an internal standard. ' H-NMR spectra were recorded at 20 on a Bruker WM250 spectrometer operating at 250 MHz. The IR spectra were measured on a Perkin Elmer 783 spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. 4.2. Materials Acetonitrile and dichloromethane HPLC grade (SDS, Peypin, France) were used as received. All alkene or alkane substrates were purchased from Janssen in their highest commercial purity, stored at 5 and purified by passage through a column of basic alumina (Aldrich) prior to use. Iodosylbenzene was prepared as described previously [9], carefully dried under reduced pressure and kept at 5. Hydrogen peroxide (H202, 30% in H20, Prolabo) was stored at 5 and titrated every month [10]. 2,6-Dichloro3-nitrobenzaldehyde was prepared by direct nitration of 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde (Janssen) according to a classical procedure [11]. Meso-tetrakis-(dichlorophenyl)porphyrin (H ZTDCPP) was prepared by the method of Lindsey and Wagner [12]. Silica CBA (Bondesil 40 p,m, containing 0.9 mmol g-' of -CH ZCOOH functional groups) from Analytichem, was dried by heating at 150 for 8 h under reduced pressure. Montmorillonite K10 (Siidchemie) was Na+-exchanged by stirring its suspension in water containing 5 M NaCl (2 g of montmorillonite for 100 ml NaCl solution). The solid was washed with 1 1 water until no NaCl was detectable in the filtration and dried for 24 h at 80. 4.3. Synthesis of Mn-porphyrins 4.3.1. Meso-tetrakis-(2,6-dichloro-3nitrophenyl)porphyrin 2 Porphyrin 2 was prepared according to a previously described procedure [8] using 4.4 g (20 mmol) of 2,6-dichloro-3-nitrobenzaldehyde 1, 1.39 ml (20 mmol) of pyrrole and 3 X 0.244 ml (2 mmol) of BF3 - Et20 in 1 1 of CH2Cl2 (freshly distilled from CaH2). The resulting porphyrinogen was oxidized by addition of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) (10 g, 44 mmol) in 200 ml of toluene. Column chromatography (alumina, CHZC12) and recrystallisation from a CHZCIz-cyclohexane mixture afforded 2 g (38% yield) of porphyrin 2. `H-NMR (CDC13), 8: -2.5 (s, 2H); 7.968.27 (2d, 8H, J = 9 Hz); 8.65 (s, 8H) ppm.

An excess of ammonia was then added and the mixture was stirred for 12 h at 20. The solvent was eliminated by distillation under vacuum and the solid residue was extracted with acetone. After filtration, the organic phase was chromatographed on a silica gel column using CH ZC12 as eluent. Recrystallization from a CHZCIz-pentane mixture afforded 0.43 g of pure 3 (98% yield).

Procedure for catalytic oxidations All substrates were checked by gas chromatography to ensure that no oxidation products were present before reaction. Reactions were carried out in a 5 ml tube equipped with a septum cap and a stirring bar at room temperature. Catalyst, cocatalyst, substrate and internal standard (acetophenone) were dissolved in a CH3CN:CHZC12 mixture (650 [,1:350 p,l) and the oxidant added last. Quantitative analysis was performed on aliquots directly withdrawn from the reaction medium.

New supported MnIII-porphyrin-based catalysts were prepared by covalent binding of meso-tetrakis-(2,6-dichlorophenyl) porphyrin derivatives bearing NH2 or SO3H functions on their meso-aryl rings to either silica or montmorillonite K10. All these supported metalloporphyrins efficiently catalysed the epoxidation of alkenes with PhIO. The MnIII-porphyrin covalently bound to montmorillonite K10 gave remarkably good results for the hydroxylation of linear alkanes such as heptane with PhIO, the obtained yields (54%) being much better than those observed with corresponding homogeneous catalysts. The MnIII-porphyrin covalently bound to silica was an efficient catalyst for epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2 (yields between 65 and 95% under conversion conditions). In the presence of an excess of substrate, this supported catalyst was found to be able to catalyse alkene epoxidation with yields based on H2O2 between 67% and 88%, as well as alkane hydroxylation with yields between 21% (for heptane) and 90% (for cyclooctane).
