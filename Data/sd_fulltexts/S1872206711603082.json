The supported silver cata- lysts were highly efficient for the epoxidation of styrene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidant and ethyl acetate as the reaction medium. The addition of KOH was found to increase the catalytic activity and selectivity significantly. Additionally, the magnetically re- coverable È–-Fe 2 O 3 , as a support, allowed for an easy separation and recycling of the catalyst after the reaction. Key words: È–-iron oxide; epoxidation; styrene; silver; nanoparticle; magnetic separation The epoxidation of styrene is of considerable academic and industrial interest. Styrene oxide is a crucial and useful inter- mediate for fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1,2]. Al- though homogeneous catalysts always have high activity in epoxidation reactions, the conventional homogeneous catalyst systems have serious drawbacks such as catalyst recovery and product separation being very difficult [3,4]. Therefore, cata- lyst systems with high activity and strong stability are of in- terest. Additionally, catalysts should be able to be separated and reused easily. Supported heterogeneous catalysts have separation and re- cycling advantages compared to homogenous catalysts. Vari- ous heterogeneous catalysts have been used for this reaction. Liu et al. [5] studied styrene epoxidation using the Ag-È–-ZrP catalyst with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant and acetonitrile as the reaction medium, and they achieved a high yield of epoxide (89.8%). Zhang et al. [1] reported that the Ag-Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite gives high activity, selectivity and it is a magnetically separable catalyst after styrene epoxidation with TBHP as oxidant and toluene as solvent. In addition, Co-Y-ZrO 2 [2], Ag/Ä®-Al 2 O 3 [6], Au/CNTs [7], Au-HAP [8], CuO/Ga 2 O 3 [9], Mn-Ti-Al-MCM-41 [10], and Co/TS-1 [11] catalysts have also been reported and used for styrene epoxi- dation. Among the reported catalysts, the Ag-based heteroge- neous catalysts are especially efficient in the epoxidation re- action. Iron oxides are environmentally friendly and relatively cheap catalyst supports. There are many different forms of iron oxides such as Ä®-Fe 2 O 3 , È–-Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 3 O 4 , and FeO [12]. Gener- ally, both È–-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 have ferromagnetic properties. Nevertheless, È–-Fe 2 O 3 as a catalyst support has many advan- tages. Firstly, È–-Fe 2 O 3 is very stable during the reaction while Fe 3 O 4 is gradually oxidized to È–-Fe 2 O 3 in the presence of an oxidant [13,14]. Secondly, the ferromagnetic property of È–-Fe 2 O 3 makes the isolation and recycling of the catalyst more convenient. Although pure È–-Fe 2 O 3 often results in low cata- lytic activity during selective oxidations under mild reaction conditions [3,15], it is very attractive as a magnetically sepa- PAN Zhenyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 428â€“435 rable catalyst support [16â€“18]. Although various supported catalysts have been used for styrene epoxidation, previous catalytic systems required toxic organic solvents (toluene, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and other toxic organic solvents) and, additionally, filtration or centrifugation for the separation of the catalyst. This may result in a mechanic loss of catalyst. In addition, alkali promoters such as K 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3 are always added to obtain high activity and selectivity in these oxidation reactions [19,20] but these bases are difficult to reuse and they generate waste after the reaction. To eliminate these problems, a supported-base catalyst has been proposed and used accordingly [21â€“25]. Therefore, a clean separation and cost effective regeneration of the catalyst and purification of products can be achieved. We used silver as a catalytically active component and then prepared a heterogeneous epoxidation catalyst by combining the advantages of a magnetic support with a supported-base promoter. In the first step, the magnetic È–-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were modified by solid base KOH and then silver was immo- bilized on the base-modified magnetic support by simple im- pregnation and consequent liquid reduction. Subsequently, styrene epoxidation was carried out over the prepared magnetic catalyst with low toxic ethyl acetate as the reaction solvent. We found that the as-obtained catalyst was very efficient for sty- rene epoxidation. Finally, the recyclability of the ferromagnetic nanocatalyst was also examined. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalysts 1.1.1 Preparation of magnetic È–-Fe 2 O 3 particles FeCl 3 Â·6H 2 O (5.00 g, 18.5 mmol, Sinopharm Chemical Re- agent Co., Ltd., Shanghai (SCRC), AR grade) and (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 Â·FeSO 4 Â·6H 2 O (5.44 g, 13.9 mmol, SCRC, AR grade) were dissolved in 200 ml of distilled water in a beaker. NH 3 Â·H 2 O (SCRC, AR grade) was then rapidly added to the mixture under nitrogen and the pH of the solution was adjusted to above 9. The whole mixture was stirred at 30 Â°C for a further 2 h. The products were black precipitates. After 3 h of aging the black precipitates were washed with water and alcohol several times and subsequently dried at 80 Â°C for 6 h followed by calcination at 300 Â°C for 2 h. 1.1.2 Preparation of KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 È–-Fe 2 O 3 (2.00 g) was impregnated with KOH (0.008 g, SCRC, AR grade), dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water in a beaker and then stirred at room temperature for 24 h. After- wards, the mixture was dried under vacuum at 80 Â°C for 2 h followed by calcination at 300 Â°C for 2 h. Catalysts with dif- ferent KOH loadings were also prepared. 1.1.3 Preparation of 10%Ag/0.4%KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 (0.200 g), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 0.100 g, SCRC, AR grade), and AgNO 3 (0.032 g, (SCRC, AR grade) were dispersed in 1 ml of distilled water in a beaker. The mixture was stirred at 80 Â°C for 8 h until all the silver ions in the solution were adsorbed onto the support (No residual silver ions were detected in the aqueous phase by the sodium chlo- ride (SCRC, AR grade) test. Cooling the solution to 0 Â°C, a NaBH 4 (0.5 mol/L, 2 ml, SCRC, AR grade) aqueous solution was added to the mixture and stirred for 1 h. The materials were then washed three times with distilled water and ethanol. The washed catalyst particles were dried under vacuum at 80 Â°C for 2 h followed by aging for 3 h at 80 Â°C under nitrogen. The content of potassium hydroxide in the catalyst was about 0.4% as determined by ICP-AES, which confirms that the loss of potassium hydroxide was negligible during catalyst prepara- tion. The preparation of the magnetically recoverable catalysts Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 is shown in Scheme 1. 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the catalysts was analyzed by powder XRD D/max 2550 VB/PC using Cu K Ä®1 radiation (Èœ = 0.154056 nm). The sample was scanned over a 2È™ range from 10Â° to 80Â° at a scanning rate of 0.02Â°/s. Trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL JEM 2100T HRTEM instrument operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using Nonmonochro Al K Ä® radiation. The binding energies were calibrated with the C 1s level of adventitious carbon (284.8 eV) as the internal standard. The Ag and K contents were analyzed by ICP-AES analysis on a Varian 710-ES instrument. A Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 was used for FT-IR characteriza- tion.

PAN Zhenyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 428â€“435 1.3 Catalytic tests The catalyst (0.020 g), styrene (0.104 g, 1 mmol, Shanghai Ling Feng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., AR grade), and ethyl acetate (1.792 g, 2 ml, SCRC, AR grade) were placed in a 25 ml Schlenk glass flask under a N 2 atmosphere and then stirred at room temperature for 30 min. TBHP (0.390 g, 3 mmol, SCRC, AR grade) was added to the reaction mixture, which then proceeded for the required time at 80 Â°C. After the reac- tion the catalyst was separated simply by a magnet and washed with ethyl acetate followed by drying in vacuum. The catalyst was then conveniently used for a next run. The reac- tion products were analyzed by gas chromatography using an FID detector. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization results The formation of metallic Ag and È–-Fe 2 O 3 in the Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst was confirmed by powder XRD (Fig. 1). A single phase of È–-Fe 2 O 3 was prepared successfully. The XRD pattern of the catalyst (Fig. 1(1)) shows that the peaks matched well with standard È–-Fe 2 O 3 reflections (JCPDS 25-1402). Figure 1(2) shows the XRD pattern of the 10%Ag/0.4%KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 composite. Apart from the char- acteristic diffraction peaks of the È–-Fe 2 O 3 reflections the clear diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 38.12Â°, 44.26Â°, 64.48Â°, and 77.36Â° are assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes of silver, respectively. These are in good agreement with the standard Ag(0) reflections (JCPDS 65-2871). Figure 1(3) shows the XRD pattern of the 10%Ag/0.4%KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 composites after five runs. There was not much change in the XRD pattern compared to the fresh catalyst. The lower iron oxide diffraction was most likely due to the low crystallinity of iron oxide and the heavy atom effect arising from the silver atoms [26]. Figure 2 shows TEM photographs and the size distribution of the fresh and reused nanoparticles. The nanocomposites consisted of nearly spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 7â€“9 nm. The overall shape and size distribution of the particles did not show obvious changes even after five runs for the magnetically separable nanocatalyst. The surface composition and oxidation state of the nano- catalyst were also analyzed by XPS. Figure 3 shows repre- sentative XPS spectra of the nanocatalyst. Elemental analysis confirmed the presence of Ag, Fe, K, C, and O.

In addition, a rela- tively weak Fe 3p line at 56.1 eV was also detected (Fig. 3). No other metallic signals were detected in the XPS spectra. Figure 4 shows the Fe 2p spectra of the different samples. All the Fe 2p spectra show a typical iron oxide structure with broad main peaks (Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 ). The characteristic doublet of Fe 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 were observed as photoelectron peaks at 710.5 and 724.1 eV, respectively. The Fe 2p data were in good agreement with the values reported for È–-Fe 2 O 3 in the literature [27,28]. These spectra show that the Fe 2p signal intensity and binding energy of composites (1) and (2) re- mained unchanged. After reusing Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 five times there was also no remarkable change in the Fe 2p peak inten- sity or the binding energy (Fig. 4(3)). These results show that the addition of KOH or Ag did not affect the structure of È–-Fe 2 O 3 and È–-Fe 2 O 3 was very stable during catalytic recycling. To determine the oxidation state of the Ag component the XPS technique was used. Figure 5 shows the Ag 3d spectra of different samples and this could be resolved into two spin orbit components, Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 . Figure 5(a) gives the XPS signal of the catalyst Ag 2 O/ KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , which was not pre-reduced by NaBH 4 , and the main peak for Ag 3d 5/2 was present at a binding energy of 367.84 eV. This was close to the values of Ag + in Ag 2 O [29,30]. Figure 5(b) shows the XPS spectrum of the freshly reduced Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst and the main peaks (Ag 3d 5/2 ) are present at binding energies of 368.09 and 367.60 eV, respectively. This data indicates that the reduced catalyst contained a higher amount of metallic silver and less ionic silver in Ag 2 O [31â€“33]. The XRD data (Fig. 1(2)) did not indicate the presence of Ag 2 O but the XPS results did indicate the possible existence of a few atomic layers of Ag + species on the nanoparticle surfaces [34]. Figure 5(c) shows the XPS spectrum of the Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst after five runs and the main peaks (Ag 3d 5/2 ) were present at binding energies of 368.26 and 367.79 eV. Although the XPS results show that a small amount of Ag 2 O was still present on the surface of the nanocatalyst the XRD data (Fig. 1(3)) showed that Ag 2 O was not present on the surface of the nanocatalyst. Additionally, the main peak at 368.26 eV (Ag 3d 5/2 ) for the recycled catalyst shifted 0.17 eV higher in terms of binding energy compared to the fresh catalyst. Because a more positive charge density on typical transition metal atoms results in higher binding ener- gies, the Ag nanoparticles were more positive after five runs, which might be due to the oxidant in the reaction system. The detailed XPS parameters of all the samples are summa- rized in Table 1. The XPS spectra also contained a K 2p sig- nal and the K 2p 3/2 peak was present at a binding energy of 292 eV [35,36]. The peak intensity and binding energy of the K 2p peak did not change after these reactions (Table 1). 1000 800 600 400 200 0 I n t e n s i t y Binding energy (eV) Fe 2p O 1s Ag 3d C 1s K 2p Fe 3p Fig. 3.

PAN Zhenyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 428â€“435 2.2 Catalytic activity for epoxidation with the magnetic silver catalyst The transformation of styrene to styrene oxide (SO) upon catalysis by the È–-Fe 2 O 3 , KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 , Ag/È–-Fe 2 O 3 , and Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalysts was investigated and the results are listed in Table 2. We found that only benzaldehyde (BZ) was formed as a main by-product. The content of Ag in the Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst has been optimized and we show that a catalyst loading of 10% Ag gives the most active catalyst. Therefore, catalysts loaded with 10% Ag were used in the following studies. When single È–-Fe 2 O 3 was used as the catalyst the selectivity for SO and BZ was 47.8% and 52.2%, respectively (Table 2, entry 2). The selectivity for SO was improved to 81.9% when using the 10%Ag/È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst (Table 2, entry 4), which confirmed clearly that both Ag and È–-Fe 2 O 3 components played a synergic role in the catalytic epoxidation. It has been reported previously that È–-Fe 2 O 3 provides reactive oxygen species [37,38] and the active species may easily transfer to the sur- face of the proximate Ag particles in the nanocatalyst. As a consequence, this process facilitated the epoxidation of the styrene molecules adsorbed on the Ag surface. Styrene ep- oxidation gave a very low conversion (16.4%) in the absence of a catalyst (Table 2, entry 1), which demonstrates the necessity for a catalyst in this system. 2.2.1 Effect of K loading The effects of different KOH loadings on the conversion of styrene and the selectivity for SO were also examined (Table 2, entries 5â€“7). When 0.4%KOH/È–-Fe 2 O 3 was used as the cata- lyst, the selectivities for SO and BZ were 53.6% and 46.4%, respectively (Table 2, entry 3). Obviously, the È–-Fe 2 O 3 modi- fied by a solid base KOH improved the selectivity for SO. Moreover, it can be seen that with an increase in the amount of KOH loading in the supported-silver catalyst both the conver- sion of styrene and the selectivity for SO increased corre- spondingly and a maximum was found for 0.4% KOH (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). However, when the supported amounts of KOH exceeded 0.4%, the conversion and selectivity dropped to 75.5% and 82.7% (Table 2, entry 7), respectively. 2.2.2 Effect of solvents As shown in Table 3, the epoxidation of styrene in different media was investigated. It was clear that the properties of the solvents greatly affected the conversion and selectivity. Ben- zoic acid (BA) was the main product obtained under sol- vent-free conditions after a 15 h reaction (Table 3, entry 2). The selectivity for SO, BZ, and BA is almost the same (36.4%, 30.9%, and 32.7%, respectively) with a reaction time of 7 h (Table 3, entry 1). This implied that SO and BZ can be further oxidized to BA possibly because of the high local concentra- tion of SO, BZ, and TBHP around the catalyst under sol- vent-free conditions. When the reaction was performed in an aqueous medium, with an increase in the reaction time the selectivity for SO decreased while that for the aldehyde in- creased (not shown). After a 15 h reaction time, BZ was the main product with a moderate conversion (Table 3, entry 3).

Conver- sion and selectivity were determined by GC analysis. PAN Zhenyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 428â€“435 was found to be quite small. The observed variation in product selectivity suggests that SO undergoes Câ€“C bond breakage to produce BZ as the main product in the water medium. Solvents like ethanol (SCRC, AR grade), ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile (Shanghai Ling Feng Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., AR grade) (Table 3, entries 4â€“6) are more favorable for the formation of SO. The conversion of styrene in ethyl acetate and acetonitrile was higher and reached 89.6% and 90.5%, respectively. Be- cause ethyl acetate is a more environmentally benign solvent it was used as a reaction medium in the following catalytic reac- tions. 2.2.3 Reaction kinetics and catalyst recycling The catalytic performance of the epoxidation of styrene versus reaction time was studied and this is shown in Fig. 6. The conversion of styrene increased continuously with time and was close to full conversion after 24 h. The yield of sty- rene epoxide was comparable with many of the heterogeneous catalytic systems reported earlier, even in other organic sol- vents [39,40]. Interestingly, both the selectivity for SO (ca. 89%) and BZ (ca. 10%) were low and constant during the whole process. This data shows that the SO and BZ were formed simultaneously in the reaction. The selectivity for SO was quite high and the formation of BZ or BA was suppressed considerably in ethyl acetate compared with that in aqueous medium or without the use of a solvent.

Catalytic performance of the 10%Ag/0.4%KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst as a function of reaction time. Reaction conditions: styrene 1 mmol, cata- lyst 20 mg (Ag 18.5 È�mol), ethyl acetate 1.792 g (2 ml), TBHP 3 mmol, 80 ÂºC, N 2 atmosphere. Recycling experiments were also undertaken for the epoxi- dation of styrene using the Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst (Fig. 7). After the first reaction, the catalyst was recovered easily using a permanent magnet and the products were simply collected by decantation. The recovered catalyst was then washed with ethyl acetate (1 ml Ã— 3) and dried under vacuum. The catalyst was reused in successive epoxidations by the addition of fresh solvent, TBHP, and substrate. The catalytic system gave 89.6% conversion for the second run and 80.1% conversion for the fifth run. Because the charge density, the overall shape and the size distribution of the catalytically active silver nanoparticles did not change significantly after consecutive runs as discussed above a gradual decrease in the conversion of styrene occurred. This was possibly because of the dissolution of silver or potassium leaching into the reaction mixture, es- pecially in the liquid phase oxidation reactions. To address this possibility, the isolated products obtained after magnetic separation were analyzed by ICP-AES. We found that the Ag concentration in the reaction effluent was only 0.3 Ã— 10 â€“6 and the content of KOH in the reused Ag/KOH-È–-Fe 2 O 3 catalyst remained unchanged (0.39%). This indicates that the leaching of Ag or K during the reaction was negligible. Based on the analysis above, the strong adsorption of the reaction products onto the surface of the catalyst could be the reason for the slow deactivation in the catalytic runs. This is also shown by the Câ€“H stretching bands (2961.2 and 2926.7 cm â€“1 ) present in the IR spectra of the reused catalyst by comparison with the fresh catalyst. Because of the high affinity of Ag and KOH for the magnetic support, a highly efficient magnetic separation can be achieved for this catalytic system. 2.2.4 Epoxidation reaction of different substrates In the next step, the generality of the oxidative reaction was investigated by varying the alkene substrates and comparing their conversions and product selectivities as listed in Table 4.

The styrene, cyclooctene (Alfa Aesar, AR grade), and 1-octene (Alfa Aesar, AR grade) were converted into corre- sponding epoxides with excellent selectivity (Table 4, entries 1, 3, and 4) but the oxidation of cyclohexene (SCRC, AR grade) resulted in the production of enols (Table 4, entry 2). 3 Conclusions A supported silver catalyst was successfully prepared by the reduction of silver salts and they were supported on the mag- netically recoverable È–-Fe 2 O 3 . The magnetically recyclable catalyst system was highly efficient in catalyzing the epoxida- tion of styrene with ethyl acetate as the reaction medium. The reduced metallic Ag component and the supported-base pro- moter played important roles in improving activity and selec- tivity during styrene epoxidation. Obviously, this catalyst system is green, simple, easily separable, and recyclable.
