Graphical abstract Bimetallic catalyst with dual-atom pairs has drawn much attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique synergistic effects. In this work, we prepared a series CeO2 supported Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts and found the optimized one of 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 exhibited excellent performance in the hydrogenation of methyl acetate (MA). Its product yield of ethanol was as 4 times as that of 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst under the same reaction conditions, with only 0.025 wt% Pt addition. Combined with various characterizations and contrast samples, it is demonstrated that the post-deposited trace Pt species preferentially located besides the copper atoms and formed Cu-Pt atomic pairs. But when further increasing the loading of Pt, the aggregation of Cu happened, leading to a rapid decrease of activity. To reveal the role of Cu-Pt atom pairs in the hydrogenation of carbon–oxygen bonds reactions, we conducted chemisorption experiments and DFT simulations. It is suggested that Cu-Pt atomic pairs significantly enhanced the adsorption and activation capability of both the MA and H2 molecules during the reaction. These insights may provide synthesis and design strategy for high-performance dual-atom sites catalysts for the carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation reactions.

For example, substrates derived from fossil or biomass resources, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, esters, and furfural, can be effectively converted into diverse products including fuels and polymers through C=O/C–O hydrogenation [4,5]. Among them, methyl acetate (MA) is one of the simplest esters containing both carbon–oxygen and carbon–carbon bonds, becoming a typical case study for carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation, particularly significant in coal-to-ethanol technology [6]. Compared to other transition metals or oxides, copper species are widely used in the MA hydrogenation due to their excellent selective hydrogenation activity towards C=O/C–O bonds while exhibiting relatively low activity towards C–C bonds [7]. Significant progress has been achieved in the developing high-performance copper-based catalysts for C=O/C–O bonds hydrogenation reactions. The synergy between Cu0 and Cu+ active species is widely regarded as critical for enhancing catalytic performance, with Cu0 species facilitating H2 dissociation and Cu+ species adsorbing and activating carbon–oxygen bonds [6]. However, during the reaction with high temperature and hydrogen partial pressure, it is difficult to stabilize the electron-deficient state of copper. Using copper phyllosilicate as the precursor is one of the methods [6,8]. Zheng et al. [3] utilized fullerene as an electron buffer to modify the copper phyllosilicate and stabilize Cu+ active sites, achieving excellent catalytic performance in various ester hydrogenation reactions under ambient pressure. The utilization of reducible metal oxide supports has been recognized as a crucial strategy for stabilizing Cu+. Among them, ceria nanorods exhibited promising applications due to their higher density of oxygen vacancies [7,9]. Minishing the Cu deposit size using reducible metal oxides [2,10] or defective supports [11] could also be effective strategies to stabilize the Cu+ species. Zhao et al. [5] prepared single-atom Cu/ZrO2 catalyst and reported that the under-coordinated Cu1-O3 species achieved 100 % selectivity for CH3OH in CO2 hydrogenation at 180 °C. But for the ester hydrogenation reactions, we found that single-atom copper catalysts are not the optimal candidates in our previous work [10]. The absence of metal–metal bonds led to hydrogen dissociation solely via heterolytic cleavage and there may competition between the adsorption of ester and hydrogen molecules on the same sites which reducing the reaction efficiency. In recent years, dual-atom sites catalysts (DACs) have drawn much attentions because of the adjacent diatomic sites can maintain efficiency while handling more complex catalytic tasks by optimizing adsorption configurations and reaction pathways [12–15]. For instance, Huang et al. [16] reported that Cu-Pd single-atom pairs achieved an exceptional activity with 100 % acetylene conversion and 92 % ethylene selectivity at 110 °C by promoting acetylene activation and ethylene desorption. And the synergistic catalysis between copper and platinum single atoms, where Pt species spilled over H atoms to Cu species, is widely recognized in hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions [17], which seems a promising way to further improve the efficiency of carbon–oxygen bonds activation and hydrogenation. Herein, we synthesized a series of CeO2 supported Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts for studying the synergistic effect of Cu-Pt atomic pairs in carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation. The effects of different Pt loading amounts and deposition sequences on the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs were investigated. The results showed that precipitating copper species before platinum is beneficial to form Cu-Pt atomic pairs and the optimized platinum content is about 0.025 wt% over the single-atom 2Cu/CeO2 sample. The 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst with abundant Cu-Pt atomic pairs exhibited a conversion of 98.4 % and ethanol selectivity of 97.3 % in the MA hydrogenation even at a low H2/MA ratio, outperforming most reported results. This superior catalytic activity arises from the promoted adsorption and activation capabilities of MA and H2 molecules by the Cu-Pt atomic pairs, as verified by various chemisorption experiments and DFT simulations. These results could provide insights into the synthesis and design of dual-atom catalysts for the carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation reactions. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.5 %), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, AR), tetraammineplatinum(II) chloride hydrate (Pt(NH3)4Cl2·xH2O, 99.99 %), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR), ethanol (C2H6O, AR), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 99.5 %) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals and reagents were used without further purification. CeO2 nanorods were synthesized via a hydrothermal method [18]. First, 1.736 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 19.2 g NaOH were dissolved in 10 mL and 70 mL deionized water, respectively. After mixing and stirring the solution at room temperature for 0.5 h, the resulting mixture was transferred to a stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h. The solid products, collected by centrifugation, underwent sequential washing with deionized water and ethanol, followed by overnight drying at 60 °C. Single atom catalysts (SACs): The 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst with a Cu loading of 2 wt% was synthesized by the deposition precipitation method [19]. Briefly, CeO2 nanorods were dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water, followed by the dropwise addition of a calculated amount of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O dissolved in 20 mL deionized water. During the process, the pH of the mixture was maintained at approximately 9 by adding 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 12 h, the solid was separated, washed, dried at 60 °C, and finally calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. The Pt/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. Specifically, CeO2 support was dispersed in 25 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of an appropriate amount of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 solution. After stirring for 12 h, the suspension was evaporated slowly by a rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The resulting solid was dried at 40 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 350 °C for 4 h, yielding xPt/CeO2 catalysts with varying Pt loadings (x = 0.025, 0.1, 0.5, 1 wt%). Dual sites catalysts: For the 2CuxPt/CeO2 catalysts, an appropriate amount of 2Cu/CeO2 sample was first dispersed in deionized water and sonicated with stirring for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the same impregnation method as for SAC was employed to introduce Pt species, resulting in catalysts denoted as 2CuxPt/CeO2 (x = 0.025, 0.1 wt%). For the 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 catalyst, 0.025Pt/CeO2 was firstly prepared by the impregnation method and then the deposition precipitation method, similar to the preparation of SAC, was employed to load 2 wt% Cu. 2.2 Catalytic performance test The catalytic performance tests were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor using 1.4 g calcined catalysts (40–60 meshes). Before the reaction, the catalysts were in situ reduced in H2 flow at 300 °C for 4 h. The reaction was carried out at 220 °C under a pressure of 2.5 MPa, maintaining a H2/MA molar ratio of 10, while varying the MA weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). The products obtained were condensed and analyzed using Agilent Micro GC 6820 with an HP-INNOWAX capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.50 μm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). 2.3 Catalyst characterization The contents of Cu and Pt elements were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Varian Vista-MPX). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) on a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer. Raman spectra was obtained on a RENISHAW inVia reflex Laser Raman spectrometer, equipped with a charge-coupled CCD detector. The laser source was Ar+ ion light source with a wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analyses were conducted using a PHI 1600 ESCA (PE Company) with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energies were calibrated with the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV, and the errors were within ± 0.2 eV. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental distribution analysis of the reduced samples were acquired using a Philips TECNAIG2 F20 system electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Aberration-corrected (AC) HAADF-STEM was employed on a JEM-ARM300F2 FHP. X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) spectra at the Cu K-edge (E0 = 8979 eV) were obtained using a standard Lytle ion chamber on the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). All test samples were reduced under a H2 flow at 300 °C for 4 h. After reduction, the samples were cooled to room temperature under the H2 flow, then sealed in a glovebox (Mikrouna, Super 1220/750/900) before testing. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on the Autochem II 2920 apparatus. Initially, 50 mg of samples were loaded into the U-tube and treated in Ar at 200 °C for 1 h prior to reduction. Subsequently, the samples were heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in the flow of 10 %H2/Ar. In MA/H2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), the samples were first reduced at 300 °C for 1 h and then purged with He. After cooling to 30 °C, the samples were exposed to the test gas atmosphere for 1 h. Subsequently, a He flow was introduced to remove weakly adsorbed molecules, and then the temperature was ramped from 30 °C to 900 °C while recording the corresponding mass spectrometry (MS) signals. N2O chemisorption was used to analyze the dispersion of CuPt dual sites catalysts. Briefly, 50 mg of samples was reduced with H2 at 300 °C for 1 h, followed by exposure to pure N2O at 90 °C for 1 h. After purging with He for 0.5 h, the TCD signal was recorded as the temperature ramped from 30 °C to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a 10 % vol.H2/Ar atmosphere. The surface Cu species content was determined based on the consumption of H2, and the dispersion of Cu species was calculated. For the temperature-programmed H2-D2 exchange, the catalyst was first reduced in a H2 flow at 300 °C for 1 h, and then cooled to test temperature under an Ar flow. The gas passing through the U-tube was then switched to a 10 % H2-10 % D2/Ar mixture. During this process, the signals at m/z = 2, 3, and 4 were collected using MS. The in situ infrared spectroscopy experiment for CO adsorption was conducted using a Nicolet 6700 infrared spectrometer manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The samples of self-supporting discs were placed into the cell, subjected to in situ reduction with H2 and cooling down to 30 °C in He flow before the CO adsorption–desorption process. After background collection, the samples were exposed to the flow of pure CO for 1 h, followed by the purging 30 min in He flow and then evacuation, until the last spectrum was the same with the previous one. The measurements were performed using CaF2 windows, an MCT/A detector with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in this work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP). The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were computed using the Projector Augmented-Wave (PAW) pseudopotentials with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional. The electronic wave functions were expanded in plane waves with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Due to the standard generalized gradient approximation functional’s limitation in accurately describing localized Ce 4f orbitals, a Hubbard-like term with U = 4.5 eV was applied to the Ce 4f states in the DFT + U approach. Brillouin zone integrations were performed using a (1 × 1 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid. The CeO2 (110) surface was represented by a slab model with a p(3 × 3) lateral unit cell consisting of four atomic layers. To prevent spurious interactions across periodic boundaries, a vacuum space of 15 Å was set for all models. Only the top two atomic layers were relaxed, and the other underlying atoms were frozen. Transition states were calculated using the Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method and verified through frequency analysis. The energy convergence criterion was set to 10-4 eV, and atomic forces in the optimized structures were kept below 0.02 eV Å-1. The Cu species charge distribution was analyzed using Bader charge analysis. The adsorption energy was calculated as E ads = E adsorbate/substrate − E substrate − E adsorbate. The activation energy (E a) and reaction energy (ΔE) were computed using E a = E TS − E IS and ΔE = E FS − E IS, where E IS, E TS, and E FS represent the total energies of the initial state (IS), transition state (TS), and final state (FS), respectively. The weak interactions between adsorbates and the catalyst were corrected using the DFT-D3 method. All activation energies were corrected for zero-point energy (ZPE). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Analysis of the deposition structures and chemical states of Cu-Pt species The CuPt/CeO2 catalysts with designed loadings were successfully synthesized (Table 1 ) via the deposition precipitation and impregnation methods (Fig. 1 a). Fig. 1 b shows the XRD patterns of reduced catalysts, in which the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 28.7°, 33.3°, 47.7°, and 56.5° were corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (331) crystal planes of cubic fluorite CeO2 (#PDF 004-0593). And no characteristic peaks corresponding to Cu or Pt species were observed, suggesting that they are both highly dispersed over the CeO2 supports. Interestingly, we observed a slight shift of the CeO2 diffraction peaks towards higher angles in the 0.025Pt/CeO2 and 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 samples preloaded with Pt species, which is attributed to the incorporation of Pt species into the CeO2 lattice [20]. AC HAADF-STEM images of the Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts are shown in Fig. S1 , demonstrating that there are neither aggregated species nor clusters on the catalyst surface. Although some highly dispersed atomic pairs are observed, it is difficult to distinguish them directly due to the poor contrast of Cu and Pt single atoms and the Ce in support [21]. Therefore, HAADF-STEM and EDS mapping were employed to observe the Cu-Pt atomic pair (Fig. 2 ). The comparison between 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 and 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalysts revealed the possible presence of numerous Cu-Pt atomic pairs in 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2, whereas fewer are observed in 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2. Furthermore, when the Pt loading increased to 0.1 wt%, some aggregation of Cu species occurred in the 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 catalyst, forming some Cu clusters of approximately 2 nm, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. EDS line scanning analysis was also conducted on Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts and illustrated in Fig. S2 . In 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2, Cu and Pt species are highly dispersed with a high degree of overlapped distribution, indicating the post-precipitated Pt species possibly selectively deposited onto the surface copper and then predominantly appearing in the form of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. But when reversed the precipitation sequence, many isolated platinum species appeared in the 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 catalyst and fewer Cu-Pt pairs formed. And in the 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2, Cu species agglomerated into 2.3 nm resulting in a significant portion of Pt species deposited onto the CeO2 support surface, leading to a reduced amount of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. The dispersion of Cu species was further verified by using N2O chemisorption [22,23]. As shown in Table 1, it is demonstrated that the Cu species existed as single atoms with a dispersion approaching 100 % in the 2Cu/CeO2. Upon loading 0.025 wt% Pt species, the calculated dispersion using hydrogen consumption exceeded 100 % due to hydrogen spill-over effect. However, with an increase of Pt loading to 1 wt%, the Cu dispersion was decreased to 49.5 % resulting from the agglomeration of copper to 2.3 nm clusters. Additionally, the same tests were conducted on CeO2 and 0.025Pt/CeO2 samples to rule out any influence on the dispersion of Cu species ( Fig. S3 ). The interaction between copper and platinum was further verified by the H2-TPR profile of the Cu-Pt catalysts in Fig. S4 , where no distinct reduction peaks for isolated Cu or Pt species could be observed. After adding Pt to the 2Cu/CeO2, the reduction peaks shifted to lower temperatures, suggesting the existence of hydrogen spill-over between them. Furthermore, a comparison between the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 and 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 catalysts revealed that the reduction peak of the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample was more uniform and distinct from that of 2Cu/CeO2. This may suggest that the sequential loading of Cu followed by Pt is more favorable for the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs, consistent with the HAADF-STEM results. To determine the deposit location and chemical states of the Cu and Pt species, we conducted XPS and XAFS characterizations over the reduced catalysts. In the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3 a), no significant satellite peaks were observed around 940–950 eV, indicating the absence of Cu2+ species on the catalyst surface. The proportion of Cu+ was obtained using Cu LMM AES, as shown in Fig. 3 b. The addition of Pt resulted in a decrease in the Cu+ proportion, indicating that electron transfer occurred from Pt species to Cu species in the Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts. Compared to the 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 sample, the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a lower proportion of Cu+, indicating a more pronounced interaction between Cu and Pt species, consisted with the HAADF-STEM and EDS results. With the same loading sequence, contrasting the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 and 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 revealed that varying the Pt loading had no significant effect on the valence state of Cu species. The XANES spectra showed that compared with the method of loading Pt species first and then Cu species, employing a loading sequence of Cu followed by Pt can make the Cu species transform to a lower oxidation state (Fig. 3 c) [5]. Considering that these two samples have similar elemental compositions (Table 1), their difference in the electronic states of Cu species could be attributed to the formation of more Cu-Pt atomic pairs in the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample. Additionally, as shown in the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3 d), there were two main peaks at 1.83 and 2.53 Å, corresponding to the Cu–O and Cu-Cu scattering, respectively. The absence of Cu-Cu bonds in all the Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts indicates the atomically dispersion state of the copper species. Unfortunately, the XAFS signal of Pt species could not be detected due to its extremely low loading amount. Raman spectroscopy analysis on the catalysts after reduction were used to deduce the deposit location of copper and platinum species as shown in Fig. S5 . A clear peak appeared at 440–460 cm−1, corresponding to the F2g vibration mode of CeO2. Compared to the CeO2 support, the F2g peaks in both 2Cu/CeO2 and Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts are significantly weaker, indicating that Cu and Pt atoms are incorporated into the CeO2 lattice. The broad peak located at 500–650 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration induced by defect sites on the CeO2 surface (D peak), which can be divided into D1 peak and D2 peak [19]. The D1 peak located near 550 cm−1 is attributed to MO8 (M=Cu or Pt) type composites, that is, Cu-[Ox]-Ce or Pt-[Ox]-Ce solid solution, while the D2 peak located near 600 cm−1 corresponds to oxygen vacancy. Thus, the ratio of IMO8/IF2g and IOv/IF2g can represent the relative contents of solid solution and oxygen vacancy in the samples, as shown in Table 1. When loading trace amounts of metal atoms, such as 0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the IOv/IF2g ratio decreased compared to the CeO2 support, indicating a preference for metal atoms to land on oxygen vacancies. However, further increasing the loading amount of metal atoms, such as 2Cu/CeO2, promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to an increase of the IOv/IF2g ratio. Comparing the 2Cu/CeO2 and 2CuxPt/CeO2 catalysts, it is observed that IMO8/IF2g and IOv/IF2g remained almost unchanged when only 0.025 wt% Pt was loaded, suggesting that the post-precipitated trace Pt species possibly tend to connect and deposit on the Cu species rather than on the CeO2 support. Whereas the content of solid solution and oxygen vacancies in the 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 sample increased significantly, indicating that excessive Pt species preferentially deposit on the surface of CeO2 support. Additionally, the precipitation sequence of metal also affects their relative locations. In the 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 sample, both the IOv/IF2g ratio and the IMO8/IF2g ratio are significantly larger than those of 2Cu/CeO2 and 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2. It is indicated that when Pt was loaded first and followed by Cu, a large amount of both Cu and Pt species deposited on the CeO2 support, thereby promoting the generation of defect sites. To further investigate the deposition environment of Cu and Pt species, XPS characterization was performed on the catalysts after reduction, as shown in Fig. S6 . We first conducted deconvolution and peak fitting on the Ce 3d XPS spectra, where u0, u’, v0, and v’ peaks are attributed to Ce3+ species, while v, v’’, v’’’, u, u’’, u’’’ peaks are attributed to Ce4+ species. It is generally believed that the oxygen vacancy is associated with Ce3+ species, forming a double spin oxygen vacancy structure where two electrons transfer to nearby Ce4+, converting it to Ce3+. [23] Hence, the surface Ce3+ proportion can be used to represent the relative content of oxygen vacancies in the catalysts. Compared to the CeO2 support, the Ce3+ ratio was lower in the 0.025Pt/CeO2 sample, while it was higher in the 2Cu/CeO2 sample, indicating that trace metal deposition covered some surface oxygen vacancies, while excess metal loading led to the generation of more oxygen vacancies over the support. For 2CuxPt/CeO2 catalysts, the Ce3+ ratio of 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 was similar to that of 2Cu/CeO2, indicating that the post-precipitated trace Pt species did not affect the oxygen vacancies on the support but probably located on the surface Cu species. Increasing the Pt loading to 0.1 wt%, the Ce3+ ratio increased from 33 % to 37 %, indicating that excess Pt species deposited on the CeO2 support, promoting the generation of oxygen vacancies. When Pt was loaded before Cu, more Cu and Pt species entered the interior of the CeO2 support, forming more oxygen vacancies, consistent with the conclusions drawn from Raman spectroscopy. Similar conclusions could be draw from the corresponding O1s XPS spectra in Fig. S7 , where the α peak could be denoted as the surface lattice oxygen and the β peak is assigned to surface oxygen (surface hydroxyl groups, water molecules, etc.) [24,25]. These results indicated that when Cu was loaded first onto the support followed by Pt, Pt species preferentially deposited on the surface Cu species rather than the CeO2 surface. When increasing the Pt loading, excess Pt entered the lattice interior of support. When Pt was loaded first followed by copper, there was less direct contact between Cu and Pt species, resulting in more metal atoms loading onto the surface of support, thereby forming more oxygen vacancies. In situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorption was employed to further investigate the position of Cu and Pt species in the as-prepared catalysts. We first prepared a series of reference samples by deposition–precipitation method to determine the CO adsorption peak positions on Pt species, including 0.025Pt/CeO2, 0.1Pt/CeO2, 0.5Pt/CeO2, and 1Pt/CeO2 ( Fig. S8 ) according to the literatures [26,27]. 0.025Pt/CeO2 sample with single atom Pt, displayed a characteristic peak at 2119 cm−1, attributed to the linear adsorption of CO molecules. As the Pt loading increased, the metallicity of Pt species strengthened, leading to a continuous shift of the CO linear adsorption peak towards lower wavenumbers. For instance, in the 0.5Pt/CeO2 and 1Pt/CeO2 samples, the CO linear adsorption peaks are located at 2060 cm−1 and 2052 cm−1 respectively. Additionally, in the 0.1Pt/CeO2, 0.5Pt/CeO2, and 1Pt/CeO2 samples, the peaks attributed to adjacent Pt atoms bridge-adsorbing CO appeared at about 1800 cm−1, indicating the presence of aggregated Pt species in these high-loading Pt/CeO2 samples. With the above reference results, the in situ FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorption were conducted and illustrated in Fig. 4 . Because the weak interaction between CO and Cu0 or Cu2+ species, the corresponding bands would disappear during the purge and evacuation process, thus there only remained the band at 2108 cm−1 of Cu+–CO species in the spectra of 2Cu/CeO2 sample [28]. When some Pt species post-deposited on the catalysts, a characteristic peak attributed to CO adsorbed on metallic Pt species appeared near 2060 cm−1 in addition to the bands of Cu+–CO species at 2104 cm−1, indicating the abundant exposure of Pt species interacting with copper on the surface of 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 and 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 catalysts. In the spectra of 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 with reversed precipitation sequence, no characteristic peaks attributed to Pt species appeared, indicating the incorporation of Pt species into CeO2 lattice. Additionally, with the increase of Pt loading to 0.1 wt%, both the CO adsorption peaks on Cu+ and Pt species shifted to lower wavenumbers, indicating the continuous enhancement of electron density of both Cu+ and Pt species with the increasing Pt incorporation. And it is worthy noticed that there was no bridging adsorption peak of CO on Pt species at 1800 cm−1 in these supported Cu-Pt samples, indicating the atomic dispersion of Pt species and no aggregation was observed, even the Pt loading was increased to 0.1 wt%. Combined the above characterizations, it is strongly suggested that in the reduced 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the platinum species were atomically dispersed and connected to the copper atom, resulting in a both enhanced electron density on copper and platinum compared to their single-atom dispersed sites due to this interaction. When further increasing the Pt loading or reversing the precipitation process, there were some single-atom platinum species deposited on the surface of CeO2 support but no aggregated Pt species was observed in the Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts. 3.2 Catalytic performance of Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts in the MA hydrogenation The catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts in the MA hydrogenation was illustrated in Fig. 5 . It is demonstrated that the 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst showed a conversion of 44.8 % and a selectivity of 47.8 % to ethanol, while the CeO2 support and 0.025Pt/CeO2 samples exhibited little catalytic activity in the MA hydrogenation, demonstrating the copper species rather than the surface defects over CeO2 support or the singly atomically dispersed platinum species could be effective active sites for MA hydrogenation. Notably, the catalytic performances were observed significant differences among the Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts with different metal loading sequences. The 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic performance in the MA hydrogenation with a 98.4 % conversion and a 97.3 % ethanol selectivity. It is worthy to mention that the product yield of 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 is as 4 times as that of 2Cu/CeO2, which was only with 0.025 wt% Pt addition. Compared to the reported catalytic performance of copper-based catalysts in MA hydrogenation, as summarized in Table S1 , the yield of ethanol over this 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst is still superior, even at such a high WHSV and a low H2/MA ratio of 10. This could be attributed to the formation of abundant Cu-Pt atomic pairs in the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample. The decreased catalytic activity of 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 could be mainly due to the increased loading of Pt species leading to the agglomeration of Cu species. Furthermore, the conversion of 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 catalyst was only 40.8 %, suggesting the prominent role of Cu-Pt atomic pairs in catalyzing MA hydrogenation. Meanwhile, we conducted stability evaluations on 2Cu/CeO2 and 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalysts, as shown in Fig. S9 . Both samples showed no significant deactivation within 100 h, indicating that the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs retains excellent thermal stability. We further supplemented some other 2CuxPt/CeO2 (x = 0.01 and 0.05) catalysts by using the same preparation method as the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst and applied them in the MA hydrogenation. The TOFCu values of these 2CuxPt/CeO2 catalysts were calculated based on the N2O chemisorption results as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S2 . The TOFCu exhibited a volcano trend change with the increasing of Pt loading and reached the peak at the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample. Combined with the above results and characterizations, it is implied the difference in the number of Cu-Pt atomic pairs formed could be the dominant factor influencing the catalytic performance of CeO2 supported Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts. 3.3 Catalytic behaviors of the Cu-Pt atomic pairs in MA hydrogenation To explore the catalytic behaviors of Cu-Pt atomic pairs during the hydrogenation of MA, a series of chemisorption characterizations were performed on the in situ reduced catalysts. We used the characteristic signal of the acetyl group with a mass-to-charge ratio of 43 to detect the MA molecules during the MA-TPD. As shown in Fig. 6 a, the desorption peak of MA shifted towards higher temperatures upon the addition of Pt species. Compared with the weak adsorption capacity of MA on the 0.025Pt/CeO2 catalyst, it is indicated that the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs greatly enhanced the adsorption capability of MA. Furthermore, with an increase in the loading of Pt species, the desorption peak intensity of MA significantly decreased. This was resulted from the aggregation of surface Cu species and the reduction of surface active sites. H2-TPD profiles of the as-prepared catalysts was exhibited in Fig. 6 b. A comparison between the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 and 2Cu0.1Pt/CeO2 catalysts revealed that with an increase in Pt loading, the H2 desorption temperature shifted towards higher temperatures, indicating stronger H2 adsorption capability. In addition, compared to the 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst, both 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 and 0.025Pt2Cu/CeO2 exhibited enhanced H2 adsorption capabilities. When the loading sequence of Cu followed by Pt was used, the interaction between Cu and Pt species was stronger, thereby further enhancing the H2 adsorption capability. Moreover, H2 dissociation ability of the catalysts was characterized by the H2-D2 exchange experiments [29]. After switching the gas flow from Ar to a H2-D2 mixture at 80 ℃, a sharp increase in the HD signal intensity of the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample was clearly observed (Fig. 6 c), while the H2 signal intensity dropped significantly (Fig. 6 d), with a conversion of approximately 30.6 %. In contrast, no HD formation was detected on the 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst at 80 ℃. Even further increasing the temperature to 150 °C, the conversion remained only about 7.7 %. This suggests that the H2 dissociation ability was profoundly enhanced by the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. DFT calculation was employed to further explore the differences in the adsorption and dissociation behaviors of MA and H2 molecules on the 2Cu/CeO2 and 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We used the single-atom copper supported on CeO2(110) (Cu/CeO2 SAC) as the 2Cu/CeO2 model and the Cu-Pt atomic pair supported on CeO2(110) (CuPt/CeO2 dual sites catalysts) as the 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 model for the DFT calculations are shown in Fig. S11 . By analyzing the Bader transfer charges of these system ( Fig. S12 and Table S3 ), the Bader transfer charge of the Cu atom in the Cu/CeO2 SAC was −0.56 |e|, whereas that changed to −0.48 |e| when another Pt atom was introduced into the system, indicating a lower oxidation state of the Cu species in the CuPt/CeO2 model. This simulation results are consistent with the Cu LMM AES and XANES spectra analysis. We then investigated the MA adsorption energy by using these models. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the Cu/CeO2 model exhibited MA adsorption exclusively by Cu atoms, with an adsorption heat of −0.54 eV. In contrast, the MA molecule interacted simultaneously with both Cu and Pt atoms on the CuPt/CeO2 model, resulting in an adsorption heat of −0.97 eV. This indicates a stronger adsorption capability of MA by the Cu-Pt atomic pair structure, in agreement with the MA-TPD results. Furthermore, using transition state simulation calculations, we further modeled the dissociation energy barriers of MA molecules, which is widely recognized as the rate-determining step in the MA hydrogenation [30,31], as shown in Fig. 7 b. It can be observed that the activation energy barrier for MA on the Cu-Pt atomic pair was significantly reduced to from 1.84 eV to 0.67 eV compared to the single-atom copper site. The simulation results imply that the transition of the MA molecule from monodentate adsorption on the Cu/CeO2 model to bidentate adsorption on the CuPt/CeO2 model may account for the superior catalytic activity of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. The dissociation energy barriers of H2 molecules were also simulated, as shown in Fig. S13 . Compared with the Cu/CeO2 model, the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs can reduce the activation barrier of H2 by 0.38 eV, which is consistent with the results of H2-D2 exchange. In summary, the formation of the Cu-Pt atomic pair structure could greatly enhance the adsorption and activation capabilities for both MA and H2 molecules, thus exhibited such a superior catalytic performance in MA hydrogenation. 4 Conclusions In this work, we introduced trace amount of platinum species onto the 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst with atomically dispersed copper species. Various characterization results indicated that the precipitation sequence of Pt species is crucial. When loading Cu species first followed by Pt species, lots of Cu-Pt atomic pairs can be obtained on the CeO2 supports. The amount of Pt species also affected the formation of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. 0.025 wt% Pt species is considered optimal while higher Pt loading led to the aggregation of Cu species from single atoms to 2.3 nm nanoparticles, resulting in great decrease of Cu-Pt atomic pairs. The 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 sample exhibited excellent catalytic performance of 98.4 % conversion and 97.3 % ethanol selectivity in MA hydrogenation even at a low H2/MA ratio, outperforming the reported copper-based catalysts. Combined with chemisorption experiments and DFT simulations, it is demonstrated that the Cu-Pt atomic pairs significantly enhanced the adsorption and activation abilities of active sites towards MA and H2 molecules, thus greatly promoted the reaction rate. These understandings are expected to offer further guidance in the development of high-performance Cu-based catalysts for the carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation reactions.

        "dc:description": "Bimetallic catalyst with dual-atom pairs has drawn much attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique synergistic effects. In this work, we prepared a series CeO2 supported Cu-Pt dual sites catalysts and found the optimized one of 2Cu0.025Pt/CeO2 exhibited excellent performance in the hydrogenation of methyl acetate (MA). Its product yield of ethanol was as 4 times as that of 2Cu/CeO2 catalyst under the same reaction conditions, with only 0.025 wt% Pt addition. Combined with various characterizations and contrast samples, it is demonstrated that the post-deposited trace Pt species preferentially located besides the copper atoms and formed Cu-Pt atomic pairs. But when further increasing the loading of Pt, the aggregation of Cu happened, leading to a rapid decrease of activity. To reveal the role of Cu-Pt atom pairs in the hydrogenation of carbon–oxygen bonds reactions, we conducted chemisorption experiments and DFT simulations. It is suggested that Cu-Pt atomic pairs significantly enhanced the adsorption and activation capability of both the MA and H2 molecules during the reaction. These insights may provide synthesis and design strategy for high-performance dual-atom sites catalysts for the carbon–oxygen bonds hydrogenation reactions.",
