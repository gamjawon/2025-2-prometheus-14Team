A New Ziegler-type heterogeneous Catalyst, CoC03 + AlEt3, for Aromatization of Tetralin STANISLAW K.

Recently Costa et al. [1] reported the first observation of the tetralin aromatization in the presence of a Ziegler-type catalyst formed in the reaction of Co and Ni acetylacetonates with triisobutylaluminium and diisobutylaluminium hydride. Except for the catalytic system (a-TiCl3 + AlRj), the reactions of insol- uble metal salts and complexes with A1R3 are not well known. In such sys- tems, the reaction of A1R3 with a transition metal compound is a surface process which may produce a solid catalyst with all its advantages. Carbon- ates of transition metals are insoluble in hydrocarbons. They have different thermal stabilities but reactions up to ca. 300 C can be performed without appreciable decomposition: e.g. cobalt carbonate decomposes at 370 - 450 C [2]. We have observed that CoC03 suspended in tetralin reacts with AlEt3 at 200 C giving a black solid I which is a catalyst for tetralin aromatization: 60% of naphthalene is produced during 12 h (molar ratio CoC03 :AlEt3 = 1; tetralin:CoC03 = 10) I tetralin naphthalene + Hz (1) Reaction (1) was performed under argon, with the gas outlet connected to the outer atmosphere. The reaction proceeded therefore under non-equilbrium conditions. Aromatization of tetralin may be performed either in situ, upon *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-6102/86/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 314 mixing CoCC>3 and AlEta in tetralin and heating to 200 C for the desired period of time, or by adding tetralin to the black solid obtained (and isolated) in the reaction CoCC>3 + AlEt3 at 200 C. The initial activity is virtually the same for both procedures. Mixing the reagents at room temperature does produce a violet solid which is inactive in the reported process even when heated with tetralin at 200 C. I retains catalytic activity for ~400 h when stored under argon, but becomes inactive after several hours upon exposure to air, although no visible changes are observed. After 12 h use, I is still catalytically active: after filtration (in Ar) from the tetralin/naphthalene mixture it transforms newly added tetralin at a rate comparable with those found during the first 12 h. Elemental analysis of I washed with benzene gives 41.6% C and 3.5% H (carbon content in CoCOy is 10.1%). Prolonged Soxhiet extraction of I with diethyl ether gives a catalytically inactive black solid with carbon and hydro- gen contents of 9.5% and 1.32% respectively. The IR spectrum of I (in KBr) is virtually identical to the spectrum of CoC03. I is strongly paramagnetic (the inactive violet solid obtained at room temperature is not). Thermograms of I and related materials are shown in Fig. 1. Organic compounds dissociat- ing from I at 20 - 240 C are tetralin and naphthalene. The mass loss of I in this temperature range is 4 - 5 times greater than that for II and III (i.e. the SO 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Op Fig. 1. Mass loss curves for I and other CoCOa-derived materials. II: CoCOy + tetralin; l h under reflux; washed with benzene. Ill: CoCOs + (tetralin/naphthalene = l); l h under reflux; washed with benzene. IA: material I after Soxhiet extraction with ether. 315 solids obtained upon interaction of tetralin and tetralin/naphthalene, respec- tively, with CoC03 at 200 C without AlEta). This suggests that the catalyst formed m the reaction with CoC03 and AlEt3 is capable of binding the tetralin and naphthalene to a much greater extent than that with CoC03 alone. In order to gain better insight into the nature of this complexation, deuterolysis of I with D^O has been performed. Tetralin and naphthalene (65 and 35% respectively) were obtained having no incorporated deuterium, which suggests that the organic compounds are not o-bonded with the active sites. Probably arene-type complexes are formed. Aromatization of tetralin in the presence of I proceeds at temperatures close to 200 C. At 80, 130 and 170 C no reaction takes place for ~15 h, but heating to 200 C after that time causes the reaction to proceed. The influence of the CoC03 :AlEt3 molar ratio upon the conversion of tetralin to naphthalene has been studied (Fig. 2). Judging from the initial reaction rates, the optimum CoC03 :AlEt3 ratio was found to be 1. For all 2 6 10 14 time [h] Fig. 2. Dependence of catalyst activity upon molar ratio CoCOa :AlEt3. Reaction condi- tions: 50 mM tetralin; 5 mM CoCOa; 200 C; Ar. ratios, the reaction proceeds at a nearly constant rate for ~9 - 10 h. When heated for longer periods of time (up to 20 h), discrepancies in the behaviour of the catalyst were observed. In some runs there is an acceleration during the 10th - 15th hour of the reaction, which might mean that active sites are produced during the reaction. In others, a typical reaction curve, with a decrease in reaction rate as conversion approaches 70 - 80%, is observed. These discrepancies are not understood at present. The maximum conversion of tetralin was about 80%, obtained after 20 h. Longer reaction times did not produce higher concentrations of naphthalene. A possible reason for this be- haviour is the stronger complexation of naphthalene than of tetralin with the active sites. An analogous catalyst, formed from CoC03 and AlEt3 in molten naphthalene, catalyzes the hydrogenation of naphthalene to tetralin with H; under atmospheric pressure. After 3 h reaction at 200 C, 6.8% of tetralin was obtained (molar ratios CoC03 :AlEt3 = 1; naphthalene: CoC03 = 10). The CoC03 + AlEt3 system is not active in dehydrogenation of decalin, which, having no aromatic ring, probably cannot complex on the active sites of the catalyst. 316 Several other cobalt salts and complexes have also been studied as catalyst precursors for tetralin aromatization, but have been found much less active than CoCOa. Under the same reaction conditions as those used for Fig. 2, Co(OAc)2-4H20 gives 6% naphthalene, with Co(OAc)2 = 16%; Co(dmgH)2-2H20 = 5%; Co(acac)3 = 8%; Co(acac)2-2H20 = 11%; Co(acac)2 = 14%; CoCl2 = 12%; CoBr2 = 12%. The activity of the catalytic system may be enhanced upon modifica- tion with '(PPh3)3RhCl. Addition of 1 mM of (PPh3)3RhCl to 5 mM of CoC03 prior to the reaction with 5 mM AlEt3 results in 70% conversion of tetralin after 12 h ; (PPh3)3RhCl alone or with AlEt3 is inactive. The following carbonates or carbonate-containing systems are inactive in tetralin aromatization: CaC03 + AlEt3; BaC03 + AlEt3; CaC03 + (PPh3)3- RhCl + AlEt3; NH4HCC>3 + (PPh3)3Rhd + AlEt3; BaC03 + (PPh3)3RhCl + AlEt3.
