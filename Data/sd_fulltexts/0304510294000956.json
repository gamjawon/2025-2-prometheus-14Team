Later Pt (1 wt.%) was incorporated by impregnation and samples reduced in hydrogen at 823 and 1073 K. Chemisorption data showed a decrease in hydrogen as temperature increases which is attributed to Pt-Sn alloy formation. Catalytic activity in isobutane dehydrogenation and nheptane dehydrocyclization seems to be dependent on the amount of metallic Pt phase. Pt/ Sn-ZnA1204 catalysts were thermally more stable than Pt/ZnA1204 preparation. Tin alters the ZnA1204 properties towards a higher thermal stability, but if added in more than 1 wt.%, it alloys with platinum inhibiting catalytic performance. Keywords: Aluminate; Dehydrogenation; High temperature treatment; Platinum; Tin; Zinc 1. Introduction Naphtha reforming as well as paraffin dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by platinum-tin on alumina catalysts. Although active and selective, these catalysts sinter and deactivate easily. New supports inhibiting particle growth, hence, have to be studied and ceramics seem to be an adequate option. It has been shown, indeed, that Pt/A1203 is more prone to metal sintering than Pt/MgA1204111- Like Pakhomov et al. [ 2 ] , we have chosen ZnA1204 to support platinum-tin, and studied some features of Pt/ZnA1204interactions. We have found, in previous works [3,4] that preparation methods alter the resulting catalyst structure and, therefore, the catalytic properties. However, it has been difficult to establish a clear *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00095-D 68 P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 correlation between structure and selectivity or/and activity. Conventional characterization techniques have only provided a partial picture of the Pt-Sn/ZnA1204 catalyst structure [ 5,6 ] . It is therefore convenient to treat these catalysts thermally and to follow their structural evolution in H2 atmosphere. The final purpose may be to obtain model samples better suited for characterization. Such an approach has been proposed by other authors whereby intermetallic compounds have been found [ 7,8 ] . The shape and size of the metal particles as well as their orientation on the support have not been reported in thermally treated R-Sn/ZnA1204, In this work, a transmission electron microscopy study focused on the metal morphology is presented. The electron microscopy results are discussed in the frame of the corresponding Xray diffraction measurements and activity tests. These catalysts are most interesting as the Sn-ZnA1204 mixed support is stable to hydrogen in the high temperature reduction, and that such is not the case for the pure ZnA1204 support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Sn-ZnA1204 mixed oxides were prepared by coprecipitation method at variable pH from an aqueous solution of Al (N03) 3 - 9H20, Zn(N03)2-6H20 and SnC12 - 2H20, maintaining a constant atomic ratio A1:Zn = 2:1, but varying the tin content. The precipitation was performed adding a 20 wt.% of (NH4) 2C03 solution to the acidic mixed solutions to a pH of 7.5 at constant temperature of 323 K. After washing and filtering, the obtained gels were aged for 24 h and dried in a vacuum oven at 383 K for 24 h. The calcination was carried out in air flow. The heating rate was 10 K/min, until a temperature of 1073 K was reached, this temperature was maintained for 8 h. The final tin content, measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy was 0.5, 1.6 and 3 wt.%. Three platinum catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the corresponding Sn-ZnA1204 supports with H2PtC16 alcoholic solution. The platinum load was the same in the three catalysts (I wt.%). Calcination was at 773 K for 4 h in air flow at a heating rate of 2 K/min. All the samples were reduced in H2 at 823 and 1073 K for 4 h, the heating rate was again 2 K/min. For comparison purposes a 1% Pt/ ZnA1204 catalyst was also prepared. 2.2. Characterization techniques Chemical compositions were obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The specific surface areas of Sn-ZnA1204 samples were determined from low temperature adsorption of nitrogen (BET method). P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 69 X-ray diffractograms were obtained with a D-500 Siemens diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The CuKa radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. HZ chemisorption measurements were carried out at 298 K on volumetric equipment. The catalysts were first pretreated at 773 K for 18 h in vacuum [4] . Conventional and high resolution electron microscopy (CTEM and HREM, respectively), were carried out in a side entry JEOL 100 CX electron microscope and in a top entry JEOL 4000 CX electron microscope equipped with a pole piece with CS =1.00 mm. Samples were ground in an agate mortar and dispersed in distilled water in an ultrasonic bath during several minutes. Then some drops were deposited on 200 mesh copper grids covered with carbon holey film. 2.3. Catalytic tests Two reactions, one very sensitive to metallic species (isobutane dehydrogenation) and a second one, sensitive to particle size among other features (n-heptane dehydrocyclization) were chosen. Isobutane was dehydrogenated using a conventional continuous flow microreactor system operating at 823 K and atmospheric pressure. The feed stream was an equimolar mixture of isobutane with hydrogen. In all the experiments 0.1 g of catalyst and a total flow rate of 4.81/h were used. Before the reaction test, catalysts were activated with HZ (1.8 1/h) at 823 K for 1 h. Activities are expressed as reaction rates in mol(g-catalyst s) -', assuming a differential behavior of the reactor. Initial reaction rate ( - rAo), initial conversion (XAo) and deactivation constant (kd) values were obtained assuming a first order parallel deactivation model [9]. The selectivity to isobutene is defined as the amount of isobutane converted to isobutene divided by the amount of all reactants converted. Dehydrocyclization of n-heptane was also measured using an integral reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. H2 flow was 21/h saturated with 33 mmHg of nheptane to obtain a HZ/nC, molar ratio of 17. The amount of catalyst was 0.2 g which gives a contact time of 57 g h/mol. Activity results are presented as total conversion of n-heptane and selectivity is referred to toluene, although CI +C4 products were also obtained. Product analysis was accomplished by on line gas chromatograph. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Chemical composition and surface features In Table 1, chemical composition, surface area (S.A.), pore volume (P. V.) and mean pore diameter (M.P.D.) of Sn-ZnA1204 calcined at 1073 K are presented. In all the samples an excess of A1 is observed. This A1 excess compared with the 70 P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 Table 1 Chemical composition and textural properties of Sn-ZnA1204 supports calcined at 1073 K Sample AI Zn wt.% Sn Atomic ratio Al /Zn S.A. m2/g P.V. ml/g M.P.D.

This process indeed, depends on temperature, concentration and pH. If the first two variables are maintained constant and pH is varied during the process then some of the Zn ions do not precipitate. The final product is, therefore, aluminum enriched. Zinc aluminate is a low surface area solid (ca. 20 m2/g in calcined samples), nevertheless the addition of some cations (Ca for instance) may improve its textural features [ 10] . In the case of Sn-ZnA1204 probably some alumina and tin compounds (not detected by XRD) increase the surface area, the pore volume and the mean pore diameter, Table 1. 3.2. Electron microscopy Conventional transmission electron microscopy is a well established method to measure metal particle size in the range 15 to 100 A. However, the shape, structure and distribution throughout the substrate of these particles are important problems which conventional microscopy has not clearly solved. The difficulties are due to phase contrast effects, confusion between particle and substrate detail and strong diffraction effects. However, these disadvantages have been reduced in modern high resolution microscopy as interplanar distances may be measured on the images. From bright field images, aggregates of crystallites like those shown in Fig. Ia were found in the three studied samples. Metallic particles were not detected in these plates. In dark field images, rounded small particles like those arrowed in Fig. lb were found using different diffracted beams. Fig. 2 is a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern from an agglomerate like the one shown in Fig. Ia. Reflections from metallic dispersed phases were not found in most cases. Fig. 3 is a HREM image from sample 1 % Pt-1.6% Sn where the crystalline phase of ZnA1204, in different orientations, can be observed. The presence of small metallic particles whose sizes varied between 0.92 nm and 1.36 nm was determined with difficulty. Fig. 4 is a HREM projected potential image from sample 1% Pt-0.5% Sn where the metallic phase dispersed on ZnA1204 is clearly observed. In the inset, a platinum particle is shown. Systematic relative orientations between platinum crystallographic planes and support planes were not observed. Particle sizes varied between 13 A and 21 A. Fig. 5 is a HREM image from sample 1% Pt-3% Sn. A small number of metallic particles were observed in this sample. The interplanar P.

This distance is not found in the JCPDS cards for Pt or Sn, it could indicate that Pt-Sn alloys are formed after HZ treatment at 1073 K. The size of the shown particle is 24 by 30 A. 3.3. X-ray diffraction In Fig. 6 the X-ray diffractograms of the three 1073 K treated Pt/Sn-ZnA1204 samples are compared. The support peaks are not as sharp and well defined as in 72 P.

( 311) and (200) reflexions are clearly broadened showing that a chemical reaction, caused by the reducing atmosphere (HZ) at high temperature, destroys the structure and decreases the crystallite size of the support. As expected, no SnA1204 was found, because alumina is already stabilized with zinc oxide. Tin aluminate is not an easily synthesized compound - alumina as well as tin oxides are preferentially obtained. Therefore, the high temperature hydrogen treatment should, only, promote the tin oxide or metallic tin presence on top of the support as very small clusters which are not detected by X-ray diffraction. Although the platinum content is in all cases 1 %, platinum peaks are only clearly observed in the 0.5 io Sn and the 3% Sn samples, but not in the 1.6% Sn. In the three catalysts, small Pt to Sn peaks can be identified, which are more intense in the 1.6% Sn preparation. Thus, it seems that only in the 1.6% Sn most of the 74 P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 Fig. 5. HREM image of the 1% Pt/3% Sn-ZnA1204 catalyst H2 treated at 1073 K. platinum alloys with tin and that in the two other preparations there is too much or not enough tin; platinum peaks are then observed. If the reference sample Pt/ZnA1204 [3,4] is treated at 1073 K the ZnA1204 structure collapses, Fig. 7, and a new compound is formed. As discussed in previous works [ 11 ] , it is clear again, that tin addition to ZnA1204 prevents the drastic reduction of the spinel structure. 3.4. HZ chemisorption In Table 2, H2 chemisorption results are presented. Pt to Sn catalysts behave as if they were more dispersed than the monometallic Pt catalyst, if treated in HZ at 823 K, excluding the 1.6% Sn sample. The HZ high temperature treatment (1073 K) reduces the amount of HZ adsorbed in the bimetallic catalysts, but the monometallic catalyst behaves the other way round. In the Pt to Sn catalysts as shown by the XRD results, Pt to Sn alloys are formed at 823 K and 1073 K, consequently, the Pt metal area (or Pt free phase) is diminished [ 6 ] . Nevertheless, Pt particles do not sinter with high temperature treatment as much as it has been observed in other metallic catalysts [ 12]. As reported previously [6] HZ adsorption seems to diminish as Sn/Pt ratio is increased. As tin content is increased the interaction P.

X-ray diffractograms of the Pt/Sn-ZnA)z0, catalysts, H2 treated at 1073 K. between tin and zinc aluminate is increased as shown, also, by HZ adsorption. Hydrogen adsorption is, indeed, determined by the amount of Pt-Sn alloy due to the reducing treatment. Hence, hydrogen adsorbed by platinum increases if tin oxides are formed [ 13 ] . 3.5. Catalytic tests Isobutane dehydrogenation Table 3 compares the initial reaction rates measured on samples treated at 823 K and 1073 K. In the first case, the highest activity is obtained with 0.5 % Sn content. As tin percentage is increased from 1.6% to 3%, the activity value reaches a plateau. Notice that the catalyst whose atomic Sn/Pt is approximately 1 (1% Pt-0.5% Sn) presents the highest activity as it has been reported previously in catalysts prepared by other methods [ 5 ] . If the above results are compared with the 1 % monometallic platinum catalyst, tin does not alter selectivity but diminishes activity, except for the 0.5% Sn sample. If the samples are treated at 1073 K, in 0.5% Sn preparation, selectivity to isobutylene remains the same as in 823 K and activity is increased. Again except for the 0.5% tin sample, all the catalysts, including the Pt monometallic, lose or maintain constant the activity value as temperature is increased to 1073 K - as 76 P.

The selectivity value of the 1 % Pt-3% Sn catalyst at 1073 K turns out to be much lower than the corresponding selectivity of the other catalysts. It is clear that, if tin content is high, platinum particles are poisoned, probably by tin species deposition. Thus, it seems that a high platinum dispersion, as measured by HZ adsorption, does not favor catalytic activity in this case. This result was expected as the reaction is not sensitive to particle size. The P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 77 Table 4 Conversion and selectivity values' in n-heptane dehydrocyclization with the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts treated in Hz at 823 and 1073 K Catalyst Conversion (mol%) Selectivity (mol%) 823 K 1073 K 823 K 1073 K 1%Pt 31 - 85 - 1%Pt-0.5%Sn 82 58 80 87 1%Pt-1.6%Sn 40 30 79 45 1%Pt-3.0%Sn 87 22 83 19 'All values extrapolated to t=0. Reaction temperature=833 K. W/F=57 g h/mol. active center better suited for selectivity in isobutane dehydrogenation is then found in the 0.5% Sn preparation. The highest deactivation value at 823 K is found with the monometallic catalyst (1% Pt/ZnA1204). Therefore tin seems to provide the stabilizing effect often reported. However if the reduction temperature is 1073 K, the deactivation constant seems to be independent of the tin content. Such behavior for the Pt-Sn catalysts was expected as tin inhibits sintering. The monometallic catalyst, in this case, is not a proper reference as the support structure is totally altered, Figs. 6 and 7. n-Heptane dehydrocyclization A second reaction was used to test if the behavior of the catalysts was reproduced. As the support is non-acidic, the only reaction favored is the dehydrocyclization [ 13,14 ] . Table 4 compares, again, the behavior of the 823 K and 1073 K treated catalysts. The 823 K treated catalysts showed almost the same selectivity (78 to 82 mol%) to toluene, but the conversion of the 1.6% Sn is one half the value found for the 0.5% and 3% Sn. If these samples are treated at 1073 K, the selectivity of the 0.5% Sn catalyst turns out to be twice the value found for the 1.6% Sn and four times the value found for the 3% Sn. Conversion does not follow the same trend as the 1.6% and 3% Sn values are the same, but the 0.5% Sn is twice this value. As expected in 1 % Pt, the conversion value at 823 K is the lowest and selectivity is in the same order as in the Pt to Sn catalysts. These results must be interpreted in terms of the catalyst structure as the reaction is structure sensitive. As shown by X-ray diffraction, Fig. 6, the relative size of the platinum and PtSn peaks vary from sample to sample. The 1.6% Sn preparation, which has the lowest conversion, has the highest PtSn peak and the Pt peak is almost not present. Hence PtSn alloy must be avoided if a high conversion is expected. Conversion in 3% Sn and 0.5% Sn catalysts, treated at 823 K, is higher as platinum peaks are present. The difference in the values found for the samples treated at 1073 K (22 and 58 mol%) must be attributed to a different degree of sintering. A low tin content inhibits platinum particle growth with temperature. This observation is confirmed by the selectivity values. Again the 3% Sn catalyst shows the lowest selectivity as it has the largest Pt particles. As selectivity remains 78 P. Bosch et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 67-78 constant in 823 and 1073 K treated 0.5% Sn catalyst, platinum particles do not sinter significantly. In the 1.6% Sn catalyst the very small amount of platinum particles present in the sample are not stabilized and behave as if they sintered selectivity decreases with temperature from 79 to 45. Selectivity and activity in the 1 % Pt monometallic catalyst were not measured in the 1073 K reduced sample as the structure is totally different, Fig. 7. The values of HZ chemisorption, in Table 1, contradict these observations: 0.5% Sn catalyst seems to sinter with temperature (Dg23K=34 A and Dto73K=52 A). However, as a variable fraction of the platinum load is used to form Pt to Sn particles, the HZ chemisorption values cannot be compared. 4. Conclusions It has been shown that Pt/Sn-ZnA1204 catalysts are thermally more stable than Pt/ZnA1204 preparations. Tin seems to alter the ZnA1204 properties towards a higher thermal stability, but if added in high percentage (more than 1 %) it alloys with platinum inhibiting catalytic performance. By electron microscopy it was shown that the metallic particles are round. Systematic relative orientations between platinum crystallographic planes and support planes were not observed. Metal-support interaction seems, therefore, to be weak. References [ 1 ] R.J. Rennard and J. Freel, J. Catal., 98 (1986) 235. [2] N.A. Pakhomov, R.A. Buyanov, E.M. Moroz, G.R. Kotelnikov and V.A.

SnZnAl2O4 mixed supports were prepared by coprecipitation method with Sn contents of 0.5, 1.6 and 3 wt.%. Later Pt (1 wt.%) was incorporated by impregnation and samples reduced in hydrogen at 823 and 1073 K. Chemisorption data showed a decrease in hydrogen as temperature increases which is attributed to PtSn alloy formation. Catalytic activity in isobutane dehydrogenation and n-heptane dehydrocyclization seems to be dependent on the amount of metallic Pt phase. Pt/SnZnAl2O4 catalysts were thermally more stable than Pt/ZnAl2O4 preparation. Tin alters the ZnAl2O4 properties towards a higher thermal stability, but if added in more than 1 wt.%, it alloys with platinum inhibiting catalytic performance.
