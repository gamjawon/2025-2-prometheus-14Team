S was successfully doped into carbon via calcination and Pd size was modulated by adjusting the S content. Sulfur species were considered to be anchor sites, contributing to the highly dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. In addition, Pd/CS4 achieved 99.9% sel. With complete conversion in hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene compared to Pd/AC (99.9% con., 61.6% sel.). Interestingly, catalysts with smaller metal size exhibited higher selectivity and lower activity, which was contrary to previous studies. It was suggested that electronic effects between S and Pd played an important role in this reaction, contributing to the excellent performance of the catalysts. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Metal size modulation Particle control Sulfur doped carbon Catalytic hydrogenation Hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene 1 Introduction Pd/C, a prominent catalyst in hydrogenation, has drawn much attention in industrial application due to its good performance and mild reaction conditions [1]. However, its application is usually limited by factors like low selectivity [2], metal leaching [3] and easy aggregation [4]. Fortunately, these problems could be solved by controlling the reduction process [5], pretreating the carrier [6], doping [7] and so on. It is widely accepted that metal size has a crucial effect on catalytic performance [8,9], and the reduction of metal size is beneficial for the exposure of active sites [10]. In order to achieve the purpose of particle regulation, many strategies are employed and doping is one of the most popular ways. The elements used for doping are mainly B [11], N [12], S [13], P [14] et al., among which N has been widely studied. For instance, Zhang [7] and Zhu [15] found that N species on the surface of doped carbon could improve the stability of Pd. Sulfur element has also been a hotspot for doping researches [16]. As early as 2000, Liu [17] et al. have reported work about the modification of nanotubes with sulfur. However, although there are many studies on sulfur-doped carbon, its application is mainly focused on supercapacitors, battery electrodes and photodetectors [18,19] while studies on its performance in selective hydrogenation have not been widely reported. Especially, articles on the modulation of Pd nanoparticles by sulfur-doping have rarely been published. Therefore, it is essential to study the regulation of Pd size by sulfur-doping and how it influences the catalytic performance during selective hydrogenation. In this paper, Pd nanoparticles were loaded on sulfur-doped activated carbon (AC) which was prepared via a hot treatment method under a N2 atmosphere. Then, the obtained catalysts were applied in selective hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB), which is sensitive to the structure of Pd nanoparticles, to investigate the influence of sulfur-doping on metal size and catalytic performance. 2 Experimental The experimental procedures were given in Supplementary Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts The elemental analysis and structure parameters of the catalysts were shown in Table 1 , among which Pd and S content was carried out by XRF while O content was analyzed by EDS. Since no leaching Pd was detected in the filtrate during impregnation process, so the theoretical Pd content of the catalysts should be 2 wt%, which was consistent with the data showed in Table 1. Meanwhile, sulfur element was successfully introduced into carbon material. The S content of Pd/CS2 increased from 0.08 wt% to 1.42 wt% compared to Pd/AC. In addition, the S content of Pd/CSx continued to increase as more Na2S was added during preparation. N2 physical adsorption-desorption was employed to analyze the microstructure of the catalysts. The parameters in Table 1 suggested that the catalysts have a considerable porous structure and specific surface area. In addition, the porous structure of AC has not been damaged since the specific surface area and pore diameter almost maintained after hot treatment with Na2S and loading of Pd nanoparticles. Since the AC we used was derived from coconut husk, slight differences of surface area and pore diameter might be caused by inaccuracy of measurements and sampling errors, which could be negligible. Raman spectra of Pd/AC and Pd/CS2 – 5 were displayed in Fig. S1 (Supplementary Information), in which the peaks approximately at 1352 cm−1 and 1581 cm−1 were corresponded to D and G band of graphitic carbon, respectively [20]. The ID/IG ratio was 1.49, 1.36, 1.45, 1.43, 1.53, respectively, indicating no significant change in graphitization and defect degree. The microstructure of the carrier basically maintained after sulfur-doping, which was consistent with the result of N2 physical adsorption-desorption. TEM images (Fig. 1 , Fig. S2 and Fig. S3) also confirmed that the overall structure of the carbon has not been damaged after calcination. According to Fig. S2 (a), Pd was dispersed on the surface of AC while only a small amount of agglomeration was observed. The average size of Pd nanoparticles of Pd/AC was about 2.97 nm. However, aggregation of Pd occurred in Pd/CS2 (Fig. S2 (b)) and the average Pd size increased to 4.3 nm. It is worth noting that an abrupt decrease of the Pd nanosize occurred rather than a continued increase, accompanied with a better dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. The average size of Pd/CS3, Pd/CS4 and Pd/CS5 was 2.70 nm, 2.53 nm and 1.84 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, Pd nanoparticles got a well dispersion in Pd/CS4. The XRD patterns were shown in Fig. 2 , which were well correlated with the TEM images. The peaks at 2θ = 40.114°, 46.658° and 68.118° represented the (111), (200), and (220) crystal faces of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure palladium, respectively. As for Pd/AC, only a very weak peak at 2θ = 40.114° and no obvious peak could be observed at 2θ = 46.658° and 68.118°, indicating that Pd nanoparticles was highly dispersed on the surface of AC. As the S content in Pd/CS2 increased to 1.42 wt%, clear diffraction peaks were observed, indicating larger size of Pd nanoparticles. Corresponding to the TEM results, as the amount of doping S increased, the diffraction peaks of Pd did not continue to increase but turned to weaken. Typically, the diffraction peaks of (200) and (220) crystal faces in Pd/CS4 and Pd/CS5 almost disappeared, proving that the metal particles got a better dispersion while the S content continually increased. Since the particle variation seemed abnormal, XRD tests were performed repeatly in order to eliminate experimental errors, however, same results were obtained. The results of TEM and XRD both indicated that the relationship between Pd nanosize and sulfur content showed a volcanic curve (Fig. S4). Since the influence of Pd loading could be negligible, we suggested that the change of Pd particle distribution was mainly caused by sulfur doping. The content and XPS spectra of O 1 s were shown in Table 1 and Fig. S5, respectively. According to precious studies [21,22], surface oxygen functional groups on the AC could have an impact on the size of supported metal, which might explain the absence of the peaks in XRD pattern of Pd/AC. Since the oxygen content and valence have not changed significantly, the effect of surface oxygen functional groups on Pd dispersion and size could be substantially eliminated. Thus, the dimensional change of Pd could mainly be attributed to the introduction of sulfur. Previous work has demonstrated that Pd is preferentially combined with sulfur species due to the strong interaction between Pd and S [23], we suggested that when only a small amount of S was introduced (Pd/CS2), it could not provide enough anchor sites on the carbon surface. Then the Pd atoms binded to these sites, resulting in metal nucleation and aggregation. However, when the amount of introduced S was sufficient to provide uniform anchor sites for Pd (Pd/CS3, Pd/CS4, Pd/CS5), the Pd particles could be well dispersed. Since structural deformation would appear due to the incorporation of heteroatoms, thereby adjusting the charge distribution of active sites [24–27], XPS was conducted to further characterize the electronic effects. The binding energies were corrected with reference to the C1s line at 284.8 eV. The XPS spectra of S 2p (Fig. S6) confirmed that sulfur has been successfully introduced and mainly existed in the form of low valence state. There was part of S existing in the form of high valence state, which might be attributed to the oxidation of S during preparation. Besides, the proportion of the low-valence S increased with the added Na2S. XPS spectra of Pd 3d in Pd/AC and Pd/CSx were shown in Fig. 3 and proportion of peak area at different binding energy was listed in Table S1. The peaks in Pd/AC with binding energy of 335.1 eV [28] and 336.0 eV [29] were attributed to two types of Pd0, of which the former was considered to be a more active Pd0 while the latter was assigned to a less active Pd0 (might be caused by adsorbed oxygen). And the peak at 337.6 eV [30] was attributed to Pd2+, which might be caused by oxidation of Pd0 during impregnation. Since S species mainly existed in low-valence state, electron would progressively shift from Pd to S due to the strong electron absorption of S, causing low-valence Pd transform into high-valence Pd. Specifically, the peaks of highly active Pd0 at 335.1 eV gradually diminished (Pd/CS2) and even disappear (Pd/CS3) after doping compared to Pd/AC. While the S content continued to increase (Pd/CS4), a new Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 doublet was observed at 338.6 eV and 343.8 eV [31], which was considered to be higher-valence Pd4+. What's more, as the added S was increased to 5 wt% (Pd/CS5), the peaks of Pd4+ continued to increase. As is shown in Table S1, the proportion of the peak area of low-valence Pd species in S-doped catalysts was apparently smaller compared to Pd/AC. The pronounced change of the diffraction peaks reflected the electron loss of Pd due to the electron absorption of S. 3.2 Catalytic performance of Pd/AC and Pd/CSx Hydrogenation of o-CNB is a gas-liquid-solid multiphase reaction process and it is desirable to work in chemical regime avoiding mass-transfer limitations. External diffusion could be eliminated when stirring rate is above 600 r/min (Fig. S7). So catalytic tests were conducted at a stirring rate between 680 and 720 r/min. The average size of the used AC is around 10–20 μm, which implies that internal diffusion could also be omitted since the impact of internal diffusion could be ignored when the average particle size of the catalysts is under 50 μm [32]. Since alcohol like methanol and ethanol is usually used as solvent in selective hydrogenation of o-CNB in industrial applications due to their stable features and low prices, we chose ethanol as solvent in this work. The catalytic performance of the Pd/CSx were listed in Table 2 and Fig. 4 , the time mentioned in Table 2 represented the time for total conversion. Apparently, the selectivity for o-CAN was improved after doping. The S content in Pd/CS2 was about 1.42 wt% and the selectivity for o-CAN increased from 61.6% to 88% compared to Pd/AC. In addition, larger amount of doped-S could lead to a better selectivity. When the content of S of Pd/CS3 reached 1.65 wt%, the selectivity reached 99.9%. Meanwhile, sulfur doping also effected the activity. Compared to Pd/AC, the reaction time increased from 2.5 h to 5 h as the S content in Pd/CS3 reached 1.65 wt%. The reaction time extended to 13.6 h when the S content of Pd/CS5 came to 2.50 wt%. Turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalysts was listed in Table 2, which was well corresponded with the extended reaction time, indicating a decline of catalytic activity. Selective hydrogenation of o-CNB is sensitive to the size of active components. As reported in previous studies [5,33,34], the performance of Pd/C in this reaction were strongly related to the dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. As the nanoparticle size increased, the activity decreased but the selectivity gradually increased. When the Pd nanosize was 28 nm, the selectivity could reach 98%. However, our study led us to a contrary conclusion: among all the prepared catalysts, Pd/CS2 had the largest Pd size, but exhibited a worse selectivity for o-CAN and a higher activity. On the contrary, Pd/CS5 with the smallest metal size, showed an excellent selectivity (>99.9%) while the reaction time extended to 13 h. The results suggested that the dominant factor here was no longer the geometric size of the active metal, but the electronic effects between the incorporated S and Pd nanoparticles. Although ultra-small Pd nanoparticles could be obtained through adjusting the doping amount of S, electron was easy to transfer from Pd to S, resulting in a decline in TOF. According to analysis of XPS, Pd mainly existed as Pd0 in Pd/AC, which exactly explained its higher activity and poor selectivity. As the S content increased, more active Pd0 was transferred to less active Pd2+/Pd4+, contributing to the reduced activity and excellent selectivity. As for Pd/CS2, which exhibited the largest Pd nanoparticles, however, still maintained high activity and unsatisfying selectivity. We would explain this phenomenon from two aspects: (1) though it had the largest Pd size, it was still much smaller than the one reported by literature (28 nm); (2) as the content of doped S was relatively small, the electron deficiency was not great enough so the Pd maintained high activity. This explained why our conclusion seemed to be completely different from other's. H2-TPD was employed in order to further prove the above opinions. H2-TPD profiles were consistent with the XPS and were listed in Fig. 5 . The desorption peaks of H2 shifted to the low temperature region with increasing S content, which confirmed that the introduction of S weakened the adsorption capacity for H2 of the catalysts, which was also responsible for the decrease of activity and improvement of selectivity in hydrogenation of o-CNB. 3.3 Recycling of catalyst In order to investigate the recyclability of the catalysts, a series of recycle experiments of Pd/CS4 were conducted. According to Fig. S8, after 9 times of reuse, the selectivity of Pd/CS4 for o-CAN did not show a significant decrease (99.9% con., 99.9% sel.), indicating an excellent stability of the sulfur-doped catalysts. H2-TPR of Pd/CS4 was combined with mass spectrometry (MS) in order to study the stability of surface sulfur species, the result of which was showed in Fig. S9. The curve in the figure was a plot of the sulfur species content in the tail gas as a function of temperature, according to which no significant decomposition of sulfur species could be observed before 600 °C. The above two aspects both demonstrated the excellent recyclability and stability of the prepared sulfur-doped catalysts. Besides, during our earlier studies, we have also proved that Pd and S leaching could be negligible during recycling [1]. 4 Conclusions Particle size of Pd was modulated through sulfur doping, and Pd size and sulfur content showed a volcanic-type relationship. It was worth noting that smaller Pd size was responsible for better selectivity and lower activity in hydrogenation of o-CNB, which was contrary to previous literature. We attributed the dominant factor to the electron transfer effect between S and Pd rather than the geometric effect of supported metal. Electron deficient state of Pd was caused due to the electron-withdrawing of doped‑sulfur, resulting in the decline of activity and improvement of selectivity compared to Pd/AC. Fortunately, it was capable to control the S content in a reasonable region so that the catalysts could still exhibit an excellent selectivity while maintaining an acceptable activity. Moreover, the S-doped catalysts showed good stability during recycle experiments. Our work has provided fresh ideas for metal size control. What's more, this work also opened up a new perspective on the potential of sulfur doping in various hydrogenation reactions.

        "dc:description": "S was successfully doped into carbon via calcination and Pd size was modulated by adjusting the S content. Sulfur species were considered to be anchor sites, contributing to the highly dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. In addition, Pd/CS4 achieved 99.9% sel. With complete conversion in hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene compared to Pd/AC (99.9% con., 61.6% sel.). Interestingly, catalysts with smaller metal size exhibited higher selectivity and lower activity, which was contrary to previous studies. It was suggested that electronic effects between S and Pd played an important role in this reaction, contributing to the excellent performance of the catalysts.",
