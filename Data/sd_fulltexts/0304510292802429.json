Csz.5Ho.5PW1204o (abbreviated as CSZ_5-salt) was remarkably more active than H3PW,204o, zeolites, NafionH, SO92-/Zroz, HZSO4, and AIC13-HCI. Solid-state \"P NMB revealed that Csz.6-salt mainly consists of polyanions with one proton (CszHPW1204o) and those without a proton (Cs3PW,ZO4o). The quantity of acid sites of Csz.b-salt was determined to be 161 pmol g-' by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3, which was much greater than the estimated quantity of surface acid sites of H3PW,ZO9o, and less than that of zeolites and S04z-/Zr02. The acid strength of Csz_5 salt measured by Hammett indicators and TPD of NH3 was smaller than that of 5042-/Zr02. It is presumed that the high activity of Cs2.5 salt is brought about by its large number of surface acid sites and its acid-base bifunctional nature, in which a caesium ion possibly increases the basicity of the heteropoly anion. Introduction Heteropoly compounds are effective catalysts for a variety of reactions in both gas-solid and liquid-solid reaction systems and have been utilized for practical processes operating under both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions [ 1 ]. We reported that Cs2.5-salt efficiently catalyzed dehydration of 2-propanol in the gas phase [ 2 ] and decomposition of ester in the liquid phase [3]. It is known that the formation of Cs salts decreases the absorption capability for polar molecules [4, 5] and greatly increases the surface area [4]. The use of solid acid catalysts in place of homogeneous catalysts such as HZSOq and AIC13-HCI is generally desirable for liquid-phase reactions. In only a few examples have solid heteropoly compounds been applied to liquidphase reactions [ 3, 6, 7 ] . Here, we wish to report the high catalytic performance of Cs2.5-salt for alkylation of aromatic compounds in the solid-liquid reaction *Catalysis by heteropoly compounds, part XXI. For part XX, see [ 12a]. \"Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 248 system [ 7 ]. We also examined the structure of the particles and the acidic properties of Cs2_5-salt to elucidate the high activity. Experimental H3PWi2040 was purchased from Nippon Inorganic Color and Chemical. The surface area was 6 m2 g-1 after evacuation at 573 K. The acidic Cs salts (CsxH3_xPW1204o) were obtained as precipitates by the titration of the aqueous solution of H3PW12040 (0.08 mol dm-3) with an aqueous solution Of CS2CO3 (Cs+; 0.25 mol dm-3) as described previously [2, 7 ]. As references, Nafion-H (NR-50, Mitsui Toatsu Fine Chemicals), HY-zeolite (obtained from SK-40, Linde), H2SO4-treated Zr02 (abbreviated as SO42-/ZrO2; prepared from ZrOC12 according to the literature method [8]), SiO2 A1203 (SA-1, Catalysts and Chemical Industries; A1203: 13 wt.ss'o), and Al-exchanged mont morillonite (prepared from an aqueous solution of A1(NO3)3 and montmo rillonite (Kunipia F)) were used [3, 9]. Furthermore, H2SO4 (Nacalai Tesque, ultra fine grade) and AIC13-HCI, which was prepared by the method described previously [ 10, 11 ], were used. The alkylation of m-xylene or 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene was carried out at 373 K under the atmospheric pressure of N2 in a threeneck flask (Pyrex glass) with a magnetic stirrer [7]. All reactants (Tokyo Chem. Ind.) were used without further purification.

The products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a Silicone OV-17 column. The acidity was measured by two methods: the color changes of Hammett indicators, and the TPD of NH3. In both cases, the catalysts were pretreated at the temperatures given in Table 1. In the TPD experiments, NH3 was dosed to the sample by a pulse method at 373 K and the temperature was raised at a rate of 10 K min-1. The gases that were desorbed were analyzed by an on-line mass spectrometer (Anelva NAG-110). The quantity of acid sites was evaluated from the desorption of NH3. When NZ was observed in TPD, the desorption of NZ was added to that of NH3 for the calculation of the amount of acid sites. Solid-state NMR spectra were obtained with magic-angle spinning (MAS) on a Fourier transform pulsed NMR spectrometer (JEOL JNM-GX270) as in the previous work [ 121. After the sample was pretreated at elevated temperatures in vacuo, it was sealed. The sealed tube was opened in a dry box under a N2 atmosphere, and was transferred to a rotor. 31P chemical shifts were referred indirectly to 15 mol dm-3 of H3P04. Results and discussion Catalytic reaction Figure 1 shows the percentage conversion of cyclohexene as a function of reaction time for the alkylation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (abbreviated as TMB). HY-zeolite, Nafion-H, and 5042-/Zr02 showed no activity, or very low activities. H3PW1204o was also much less active. On the contrary, Cs2,5-salt exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity.

The slight difference in the rate between the second and third runs is probably due to the loss of the catalyst during filtration. That is, the deactivation of the catalyst was small under the reaction conditions. This indicates that the reaction did not take place in the solution, and the active component was not dissolved in the liquid. When Cs2.s-salt was used after drying at room temperature (without the heat treatment), its activity was about two-thirds that of the fresh catalyst. The catalytic activities of various solid and liquid catalysts for the alkylation of m-xylene (mX) and TMB are also summarized in Table 1. The data in Table 1 demonstrate the superiority of CS2,6-Salt; it was much more active than the parent H3PW1204o, and its activities were at least fifteen and fifty times as high as those of the other solid acids for the reactions of mX and TMB, respectively. It is noted that Cs2_6-salt was superior even to H2S04 and AIC13-HCl. Structure of CSZ.S-salt In order to elucidate the structure of Cs2.5-salt, NMR spectra of 31P, the central atom of the heteropoly anion, were measured. Black et al. [ 13 ] Studied the structure of K2_5Ho.5PMo12040 by means of XRD, NMR, and EM, and proposed a model in which an epitaxial, isostructural surface layer of H3PM012040 is dispersed on the particle of K3PMo12040- We presumed, mainly based on XRD data, that CS2.5Ho.6PW12040 is a mixture of CS2HPW12040 and CS3PW12040 [181. The 31P NMR spectra of H3PW1204o and the acidic Cs salts are shown in Fig. 2 [14]. Anhydrous H3PW12040, which was prepared by evacuation at 573 K, showed a slightly broad peak at -10.9 ppm, while the hexahydrated sample (HRW12040 - 61120) gave a sharp peak at -15.6 ppm [ 15 ]. H3PW12040-6H2O has a structure in which protonated water molecules, H(H20)2+, connect heteropoly anions by hydrogen-bonding at the terminal oxygens of the heteropoly anion [ 16 ] . On the other hand, protons in anhydrous H3PW12040 attach directly to the bridging oxygens of the heteropoly anion [ 151, which are more basic [ 17 ] . Therefore, whether the proton attaches to the bridging oxygen or not is probably responsible for the difference in the 31P chemical shift between H3PW12040 (-10.9 ppm) and H3PW12040 - 61120 (-15.6 ppm). For CS3PW12040, only one peak was observed, at - 14.9 ppm (Fig. 2b), which is close to that for H3PW1204O - 61120. The values may be close because no protons attach to the bridging oxygens of polyanions in both CS3PW1204O and H3PW1204O - 6H2O. In the case of CS2HPW1204o, which was pretreated at 473 K in vacuo, two new peaks, at -12.1 and -13.4 ppm, appeared in addition to the two peaks at -10.9 and -14.9 ppm (Fig. 2c). This shows that CS2HPW12040 consists of four different species. It is very probable that they are CSxH3_xPW12040 (x=0, 1, 2, and 3), and their chemical shifts are primarily 251 -10.9 ppm a b d -14.9 ppm -10 -20 Chemical Shift / ppm Fig. 2. 3'P NMR spectra of heteropoly compounds: (a) H3PW,ZOqo (573 K); (b) Cs3PW,ZOqo (573 K); (c) Cs2HPW,ZOqo (473 K); (d) CS2.5Hp.5PW12Cq0 (573 K). The figures in parentheses are the evacuation temperatures. determined by the number of protons connected directly to bridging oxygens of the polyanion. For CS2.5-salt (pretreated at 573 K), peaks at -13.4 and - 14.9 ppm were the main peaks, demonstrating that CS2.5-salt mainly consists of polyanions with one proton (HCs2PW12040; -13.4 ppm) at bridging oxygen and those without a proton (Cs3PWI204o; -14.9 ppm). These models are different from that of Black et al. [ 13 ]. It is also probable that, particularly after treatment at high temperatures for a long period, a uniform acidic Cs salt having the same average composition is formed, as will be discussed elsewhere. When CS2.5-salt was exposed to water vapor, the peak at - 13.4 ppm became negligibly small, and only the peak at - 14.9 ppm remained. This implies that water interacts with the whole protons of CS2.5-salt and separates the proton from the bridging oxygen of the polyanion. When H3PW120qo was supported on Cs3PW1204o by impregnation with the aqueous solution of H3PW12040, where the quantity was adjusted to form an average composition of Cs2.5Ho.5PW,zO4o, 31P NMR spectra similar to that in Fig. 2d were observed. This shows that the exchange between H+ and Cs' took place during the preparation and/or the heating process. The particle size of CS2.5-salt was estimated to be 7-10 nn from the surface 252 area (100-140 m2 g-1) [181. Measurement of pore-size distribution for CS2.5salt after evacuation at 573 K indicated the presence of interparticle micropores having diameters less than about 4.0 nm. Surface acidity The surface area and the amount of acid sites are summarized in Table 2. Since nonpolar molecules such as aromatic compounds and olefinic hydrocarbons are adsorbed only on the surface and react there [ 19 ], only protons on the surface can take part in the reaction. In the case of H3PW1204o, however, pyridine or NH3 was absorbed into the whole bulk [20[. Thus the amount measured for H3PW12040 using these molecules corresponds to that of the bulk phase but not the surface. So, the amount of acid sites on the surface of H3PW1204o was estimated from the surface area and the composition (H+120403 -3) to be 8-16 wmol g-1. The quantity of acid Sites Of Cs2.6salt was determined to be 161 /umol g-1 by TPD of NH3. However, since polar molecules were also absorbed into the bulk of Cs2HPW12040 [4], the acid sites measured by TPD of NH3 are not necessarily those on the surface Of Cs2.5-salt. As shown in Table 2, the amounts of acid sites on the surface are in the following order: HY, Nafion-H > ZSM-5 > S042-/Zr02 > CS2.5-salt > HJW12040. Although Cs2.b-salt has a smaller number of acid sites than 5042-/ Zr02, the former was at least 20 times more active than the latter. Thus the high activity Of CS2.5-Salt cannot be explained only by the amount of acid sites. First, the acid strength is considered. TPD spectra of NH3 are given in Fig. 3. NH3 adsorbed on Si02 A1203 was mostly desorbed at a temperature lower than 773 K, showing that its acid strength is not high.

ZSM-5, two peaks at 473 and 653 K were observed, in agreement with previous reports [21 ]. Csz.S-salt gave a broad peak from 673 to 973 K, together with sharp but smaller peaks of Nz and H20 (not shown) having maxima at about 850 K. Nz was probably formed by the reaction of NH3 with oxygen of the heteropoly anion, since H3PWlz04o was reported to be active for dehydrogenation [22]. The peak temperature of NH3-TPD for H3PW,zO4o was close to that for Csz.S-salt, although the peak for H3PW1zO4o was narrower than that for Csz.S-salt. So, the acid strengths of Csz,S-salt and H3PW,z04o are similar. In the case of S04z-/ZrOz, the desorption as Nz took place at much higher temperatures ( > 1073 K), although desorption as NH3 was completed below 773 K. The high temperature of Nz desorption implies the presence of strong acid sites, since the Nz originated from NH3. The order of acid strength estimated from TPD is as follows: S04z-/ ZrOz > H3PWlz04o, Csz.s-alt > H-ZSM-5 > Si02 A1z03. Table 3 shows the acid strength measured by Hammett indicators. Seven indicators, with pKa values ranging from - 5.6 to - 14.5, were used. The order of the acid strength measured by the indicators was in agreement with that from NH3-TPD. S04z-/ZrOz had acid sites of Ho < -14.5, which is consistent with Arata's data [8], while Umansky et aL. reported that S04z-/ ZrOz was a mild superacid having Ho= -12 [23]. Actually, S04z-/ZrOz prepared in the present work was active for the skeletal isomerization of pentane to 2-methylbutane in the gas phase, as described in the literature [8], and its catalytic activity for this reaction was about fifty times that of 254 TABLE 3 Acid strength measured by Hammett indicators Catalyst' pK, of indicatorb -5.6 -8.2 -11.35 -12.70 -13.16 -13.75 -14.52 Cs2.5Ha.6PW1204o (573 K) + + + + + - - H3- \" 12040 (573 K) + + + + + - - H-ZSM-5 (808 K) + + + + - - - S042-/Zr02 (643 K) + + + + + + + Si02-M203 (723 K) + + + + - - - 'The figures in parentheses are the pretreatment temperatures. bAcidic color of the indicator was observed (+), or not at all (-).

Thus the high activity Of Cs2.5-salt for alkylation (Table 1) cannot be explained only by the acidic properties, even when both the amount and the strength are considered. The hydrophobic nature of the surface Of Cs2.5-salt may be an additional factor. Since the surface of Cs2.5-salt is much less hydrophilic than the acidic sodium salts [24], aromatic compounds and cyclohexene could be more strongly adsorbed and activated on the surface of Csz.b-salt. The function of the basicity of the polyanion is another possibility. Izumi et al. [25] pointed out the importance of the soft basicity of the heteropoly anion for catalysis in homogeneous liquid-phase systems; the heteropoly anion stabilizes and activates reaction intermediates such as carbocation or oxonium ion. Considering the generation of weak basic sites by the exchange of K+ or Cs' for H+ in zeolites [26], the basicity of the heteropoly anion is presumably enhanced by the presence of Cs+, although there is no direct evidence for the increase in the basicity. As proton and Cs ion coexist on the surface, it is likely that acid-base bifunctional catalysis operates and 255 enhances the catalytic activity of Cs2.5-salt. A possible mechanism for the bifunctional action is given in Fig. 4, where polyanion stabilizes the cyclohexyl cation and/or the cyclohexyl 1,3,5-trimethylphenyl cation, or accelerates the abstraction of proton from the latter cation. HY and H-ZSM-5 zeolites showed very low activities, in spite of the large amounts of acid sites. Take et al. [271 reported that only small amounts of acid sites were present on the external surface of these zeolites, and their acid strengths were weaker than those of the sites on the internal surface. Therefore, slow diffusion of reactants into the pores of zeolites may be the main reason for the low activities.

Liquid-phase alkylation ofm-xylene or trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene was studied using heteropoly compounds and other typical solid acids as the catalysts; the results are discussed in relation to the surface properties of the catalysts. Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (abbreviated as Cs2.5-salt) was remarkably more active than H3PW12O40, zeolites, Nafion-H, SO4 2−/ZrO2, H2SO4, and AlCl3 HCl. Solid-state31P NMR revealed that Cs2.5-salt mainly consists of polyanions with one proton (Cs2HPW12O40) and those without a proton (Cs3PW12O40). The quantity of acid sites of Cs2.5-salt was determined to be 161 μmol g−1 by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3, which was much greater than the estimated quantity of surface acid sites of H3PW12O40, and less than that of zeolites and SO4 2−/ZrO2. The acid strength of Cs2.5-salt measured by Hammett indicators and TPD of NH3 was smaller than that of SO4 2−/ZrO2. It is presumed that the high activity of Cs2.5-salt is brought about by its large number of surface acid sites and its acid—base bifunctional nature, in which a caesium ion possibly increases the basicity of the heteropoly anion.
