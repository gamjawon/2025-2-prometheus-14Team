Pd/pumice catalysts exhibit good activity and excellent selectivity and stability in the title reaction. Their activity/ selectivity pattern is controlled by the composition of the reaction mixture. The turnover frequency (TOF) increases, and the apparent activation energy (Ea) decreases, with the HZ/CZHZ ratio, but they are not affected by the C,H2/CZHQ ratio. The selectivity to ethane (SE) does not change with acetylene conversion at low Hz/CZH2 ratio (tail-end cut) and increases at high HZ/CZHz ratio (front-end cut). No dependence of SE with acetylene conversion was found, at any HZ/CZHZ ratio, on varying the metal dispersion. TOF and SE change with metal loading depending on the reaction mixtures; low metal loaded catalysts gave the best activity/ selectivity pattern. Pd/pumice catalysts do not show aging phenomena even when used in drastic conditions (high space velocities and front-end cuts). The catalytic behavior of Pd/pumice catalysts, as a function of the composition of reaction mixture, elucidated by using the isokinetic relationship (IKR) approach shows that the relative amount of hydrogen in the feedstocks plays an important role in activation/deactivation processes which occurs on the metal surface. By considering the presence of different centers on the catalyst and by performing data analysis with a suitable mathematical model, the microscopical mechanism and the role of surface deposits can be explained. A similar reaction mechanism is applicable to the other palladium catalysts, at least in the case of tail-end mixtures.

Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 1. Introduction Selective hydrogenation of small amounts of acetylene in ethylene rich feedstocks [1] is an important industrial target. In order to avoid poisoning of the catalyst in the ethylene polymerization, acetylene concentration must be reduced to a level less than 5-10 ppm [2,3]. There are two types of ethylene feedstocks, namely front-end [3,4] and tail-end [2,5,6] cuts, used in the industrial processes. Both of them contain 0.5-3% alkyne, but the content of HZ is between 0.5 and 6% and more than 60% for the tail-end and front-end cut, respectively. Hydrogenation of acetylene to ethane on metal catalysts is generally described by parallel/ consecutive pathways [7,8] (Scheme 1), one involving the direct hydrogenation to ethane and the other accounting for the formation of ethylene as an intermediate in a two-step reaction sequence, as shown in Scheme 1. Several attempts were accomplished in order to rationalize the behavior of supported Pd catalysts in the hydrogenation of alkynes on the basis of thermodynamic effects [9], metal dispersion [3,6], interaction of different catalytic sites [10-14], formation of carbonaceous [15] and/or hydride species [7,16]. However, definitive insight into the microscopical involvement of the surface reaction was not provided up to now. It is well known [1,3] that in the hydrogenation of trace amounts of acetylene, selectivity is the most important feature. In the current industrial practice the selectivity of the Pd/A1203 catalysts is enhanced by addition of trace amounts of carbon monoxide [1,17] to the ethylene feedstocks. The presence of CO, besides being toxic, produces some inconveniences in the industrial process because of the formation of undesired `green oil' fractions. Furthermore, it has been claimed that the use of ionic salts [18] and Pd-M (M = Si, Ge, Pb) alloys [8,19] significantly improves the selectivity of Pd supported catalysts to ethylene. In our recent studies on Pd/pumice catalysts [20] on the selective liquid phase hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene [21] and phenylacetylene [22,23], evidence was given on the importance of alkali metal ions in the structure of pumice [24]. To determine the particular behaviors of the pumice supported palladium catalysts in those reactions, the study of Pd/pumice catalysts in the gas phase hydrogenation of acetylene in tail-end and front-end ethylene feedstocks was initiated by us. In this paper we report the results of these studies and we compare our catalysts with conventional Pd/S'02 and Pd/A1203 catalysts. C2H2 -~C2H4 -4C2H6 I T Scheme 1. D. Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 271 A working mechanism of such Pd/pumice catalysts, involving the participation of different surface catalytic sites, is proposed. 2. Experimental The pumice supported Pd catalysts applied in this work, were prepared according to the Yermakov method [25], as previously reported [26], or by impregnation of pumice with a solution of PdCl2, subsequent drying at 373 K for 6 h, calcination at 673 K for 4 h and reduction under Hz at 573 K for 2 h. For the sake of comparison similar silica and alumina supported Pd catalysts were also prepared. The list of the catalysts used, the palladium content, the apparent density, the metal dispersions obtained after reduction at various temperatures are reported in Table 1. The metal dispersion (Dx) of the Pd/pumice catalysts was determined by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [26]. For the other catalysts this technique is not applicable in the determination of Dx since the presence of some crystallinity in Si02 and A1203, in addition to the low metal content, does not allow an easy subtraction of the contribution of the support [27] in the X-ray spectra. However, since in this work comparison among catalysts is made on the basis of the parameters related to the specific activity (moles transformed per gram of metal per second), this lack does not influence the interpretation of the results.

Tail-end cut mixture. Selective hydrogenation of acetylene was studied by using several ethylene rich feedstocks. The composition of the gas mixtures (SIAD Ltd., Bergamo, Italy) are reported in Table 2. No impurities like CO, OZ or other poisonings were detected in the reaction mixtures. The absence of any influence of diffusion effects under operating conditions was adequately checked. Catalytic tests were performed by a continuous flow fixed-bed stainless-steel microreactor (l = 150 mm, I.D. = 4 mm) operating at atmospheric pressure. The microreactor was immersed in a thermostated bath (Haake F3-CH thermostat) in order to achieve an accurate temperature control (0.2). Measurements were carried out in the range 283-340 K with 0.01-0.25 g of catalyst sample (40-70 mesh) diluted with same sized carborundum (1/3-1/10, v/v) and the flow rate of the reaction mixture was ranging from 20 to 500 N cm3/min. Always, except in the first point ( vo) of the tests of stability (see later), before acquisition of activity data, the catalyst samples were conditioned `in situ', for 20 min, in the reaction mixture at the reaction temperature. Reactant and reaction products were analyzed by an `on line' DANI 3800 gas-chromatograph equipped with a 2.5 m CARBOXEN 100 column (60-80 mesh) operating at 180, a TCD detector and a Spectra-Physics SP-4270 data processor. Since small changes in ethylene conversion were difficult to detect owing to the excess of this component in the mixtures, we used the selectivity to ethane SE ((ethane formed) /(acetylene converted)) [6] as the parameter of reaction selectivity. 3. Results and discussion Although the selective hydrogenation of C Z H 2 in industrial C 2 H 4 feedstocks on Pd catalysts has attracted great interest, no studies compared the performance of the Pd catalysts in both tail- and front-end cuts. This work aims to outline the characteristics of Pd/pumice catalysts in this reaction by using different reaction mixtures and to compare the behavior of Pd/pumice catalysts to that of other traditional Pd catalysts, namely Pd/S'02 and Pd/A1203.

For MIX5 the points are obtained by multiplying the experimental data by 103. The evolution of TOF (s-') of the PYa298 catalyst in the temperature range 280-340 K for different reaction mixtures is shown in Fig. 1. The TOF values vs. temperature increase at any feedstock composition in sequence of MIX5 < MIX3 < MIX I which indicates that TOF rises with the H Z/C 2 H 2 ratio while it is not affected by the C2HZ/C2H4 ratio. By plotting In TOF vs. 1/T the apparent activation energy (Ea) values for the different reaction mixtures, presented in Table 3, were obtained. It is remarkable that Ea increases on decreasing the HZ/C2HZ ratio. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of TOF with Dx for pumice supported catalysts with a front-end (MIX1) and a tail-end (MIX5) cut. It is evident that in MIX5 TOF decreases with the metal dispersion but this dependence is small when the tail-end cut is used. A similar small influence of Dx on TOF values was found for hydrogenation of phenylacetylene over Pd/pumice catalysts in the liquid phase [22,23] (where the hydrogen/alkyne ratio was much closer to the tail-end cut).

TOF values, at 298 K, of the Pd/pumice catalysts vs. DA (metal dispersion) for MIX5 (filled symbols) and MIXl (open symbols) reaction mixtures. For MIX5 the points are obtained by multiplying the experimental data by 103. Considering a generic mixture and varying simultaneously both the space velocity and the temperature it was found that SE depends on the acetylene conversion. However, the composition of reaction mixture can also affect SE; in Fig. 3 SE is reported vs. acetylene conversion for the PYa298 catalyst in different reaction mixtures, and, indeed, SE does not change on increasing acetylene conversion in the tail-end (MIX5) mixture but it steadily increases in the front-end (MIX1 and MIX3) mixtures. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4 for Pd/pumice catalysts, there is no dependence on SE, at any C Z H z conversions, on the catalyst reduction temperature (i.e. on metal dispersion), irrespective of the industrial cut (tail- or front-end) used. Although some contrasting reports appeared in the literature [3,6,22,28] on this topic, these results confirm our previous ones on liquid phase hydrogenation of phenylacetylene [22,23] on Pd/pumice catalysts. The evidences mentioned suggest that the type of industrial cut, i.e. the reaction mixture composition, controls the catalytic behavior of the Pd/pumice catalysts. In order to check the validity of this hypothesis, the isokinetic relationship (IKR) [29] approach was, therefore, applied. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of the compensation effect approach, which suggested that a linear correlation between the apparent activation energies (Ea,;) and the logarithms of the preexponential factors (In A;) in a series of closely related reactions (index i) were indicative of the same mechanism. Indeed the validity of the compensation effect approach is questionable owing to the difficulty of D.

It is important to note, however, that for experimental data it is possible to deduce linearity between In Ai and Ea,i from the point of intersection but not the reverse [34]. The IKR approach in the present study is obtained from the specific rate constants (moles of acetylene converted per gram of Pd per second) vs. 1/T using Eq. (4), for the series of reaction systems (catalysts + reaction mixture) used in this work. Fig. 5 suggests that different catalysts, when used with the same feedstock, behave according to an analogous kinetic mechanism, whereas the reaction mechanism ought to be analogous only for the catalysts tested with closely related feedstocks (i.e. MIX1 and MIX3). This behavior is confirmed [35] in Fig. 6, where, by plotting in the plane In A vs. Ea the points related to the couples PYa673-MIX1, PYa473-MIXI, PYa298-MIX1 and PYa298-MIX3, a straight line a is obtained. The couples formed by the above first three catalysts with MIX5 give another straight line (b); moreover also the points obtained with couples formed by the other catalysts and MIX5 are reported in Fig. 6 and these points are very close to line b. The values of 1/T;SO obtained by the slope of line a and b are in accordance with the value of Tiso resulting from the IKR approach (Fig. 5). This influence of the gas composition on the reaction mechanism seems to be confirmed by a series of experiments performed in order to evaluate the effect of the preconditioning on the catalytic behavior. On this account the catalysts were kept 1 h at 333 K in a flux of hydrogen, or in a flux of a gas mixture, before starting the collection of the data. No change in activity and selectivity to ethane is observed when the catalyst pretreatment is performed in hydrogen flux. This fact likely indicates that in our experimental conditions the catalytic behavior is not affected by the formation of Pd-H [16] species. This evidence is further supported by the fact that no increased intensity of the D.

Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 reflection peak (111) of Pd particles [36] was detected by WAXS analyses in the PYc298 catalyst used several times in front-end reaction mixtures (MIX1). The pretreatment with MIX1 (front-end feedstock) does not imply any changes in activity and selectivity to ethane of catalysts with low metal content, while it causes a large decrease in activity and in selectivity to ethane for high metal loadings. The extent of such an influence seems to be proportional to the Pd loading. Conversely, conditioning of the richest metal catalysts with MIX5 (tail-end feedstock) does not modify either activity or selectivity to ethane whilst such a conditioning enhances activity and depresses selectivity to ethane of low loaded Pd catalysts. Therefore, low loaded palladium catalysts give at any ethylene rich feedstocks the best activity/ selectivity pattern. The above experimental findings as well as the IKR results probe the occurrence of two different mechanisms; however, they can be rationalized by invoking a unique working mechanism controlled by the gas mixture composition. Namely, we can infer the intervention of a slow deactivation and a fast activation process on the catalyst surface. Moreover, metal richer catalysts could accelerate all the surface processes. Indeed, the deactivation process is observed only in the fastest reactions (MIX1-metal richer catalysts) while the activation process is observed only in the slowest ones. In order to achieve a deeper insight in this matter, the stability of the PYa298 at 303 K in front-end and tail-end mixtures was evaluated, being aware that the metal dispersion of PYa298 catalyst does not change at the temperature of the experiments. The experimental points are reported in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for MIX 1 and MIX5, respectively in terms of relative reaction rate r (r = v/vo where v is the reaction rate at time t and vo, which is determined without any preconditioning time, is the reaction rate at time 0) vs. reaction time. The curves shown in the above figures are obtained from a simplified model based on previous mechanistic findings on acetylene hydrogenation [10-15] which hypothesize three types of sites on the catalytic surface: X1, primary sites accessible to the gas species; X2, sites accessible only to acetylene and hydrogen; X3, irreversibly poisoned sites. X, could be the original metallic sites or could be produced from these ones in a very fast way before formation of X 2 and X3. X 2 can be considered primary sites coated by slowly desorbed carbonaceous species analogous to those suggested for the hydrogenation of ethylene [ 11-15] and the irreversibly poisoned sites X 3 could be due to polymers and/or other carbon containing compounds [17,37]. In a recent study on the hydrogenation of acetylene over silica supported Pd and Pt catalysts [38] in a micropulse reactor, carbonaceous deposits, although no active, are reported to influence the selectivity of the reaction. Promoting and aging effects on the Pd surface seems to be confirmed by a kinetic study of the hydrogenation of acetylene over supported Pd catalysts performed in a recirculation fixed bed reactor [39] with various C2Hz/HZ gas mixtures.

Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 A01 \\4 X2 --~ X3 Scheme 2. Moreover, it has been claimed [40] that some catalytic surface sites are accessible only to hydrogen, owing to the steric hindrance of organic species. So the presence of competitive and uncompetitive hydrogen surface sites [41], in both X , and X 2 , cannot be ruled out. The evolution of the sites is governed by the equilibrium shown in Scheme 2. The existence of such different surface sites on the progress of the reaction and the mechanism of their transformations (Scheme 2) are also supported by the following experimental evidences: (i) when the gas mixtures containing different percentage of hydrogen and ethylene, react on a Pd supported catalyst, there is a progressive poisoning of the catalyst with a rate which increases as the HZ/C2H4 ratio decreases; (ii) when a small amount of acetylene is added to the above gas mixtures using a fresh catalyst, the ethylene hydrogenation and the rate of poisoning are greatly reduced; (iii) when a Pd catalyst is deactivated during ethylene hydrogenation, it cannot be reactivated by addition of acetylene. Usually in the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons on a metal catalyst, the fraction of sites occupied by the hydrocarbons is assumed to be constant during the reaction, and since also the species on sites X3 (poisoned sites) are hydrocarbons, this assumption appears to be valid in our case. Therefore, taking into account only the relative modifications of the surface sites (Scheme 2) the ordinary system of differential equations (ODES) is: d(X,)/dt = -(k,2 + k,3)(X,) + k2,(X2) (5) d(X2)/dt= =(k2, +k23)(X2)+k,2(X,) (6) d(X3)/dt= k]3(X1) + k23(X2) where kn represents the kinetic constant of the transformation of site X, into X.. Considering a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, the conversion rate of acetylene based on the above model is: U kJOacll[OH,1(X1)+k2[OacJ2[OH,2(X2) with krate constant on X,, site, and [ Oaj, and [ OH ]n the fraction of Xsites occupied by acetylene and hydrogen respectively. In our experimental pseudo steady-state conditions the generic kn[ Oac] OH ]is constant provided that the feedstock, as well the temperature and the space velocity remain unchanged. D. Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 281 Furthermore, the reaction rate at the initial time is: v'o=kl[OacIl[OHII(Xl)' with (X I )= I and: v/vo = (XI) + tx(X2) (10) where a = k2[Oac]2[OH]2/kl[6ac]l[OH]l - const. The iterative procedure of the experimental v/vo fit, performed by home made FORTRAN programs, worked with the following steps (subprograms): (i) Continuous minimization by simulated annealing [42] subprogram fixed tentative values of the five fitting parameters (kI2, k13, k2l, k23 and a); (ii) Builirsh-Stoer method [42] subprogram calculated the time dependent functions Xn (n = 1,2,3; Fig. 7 and Fig. 8), employing the five parameters of step (i); (iii) Home made computing subprogram, employing a and X(n = 1,2,3), determined, at each time, the computed values of the fitting function v/vo and calculated a X 2 function evaluating the gaps between the theoretical and experimental v/vo values; (iv) continuous minimization by simulated annealing [42] subprogram verified if the fit convergence limits were reached. In the positive case, the five parameters of step (i) and the Xn functions of step (ii) were determined and the fit procedure ended. In the negative cases the fit procedure started again from (i) until the fit convergence limits were reached. We verified with another fitting subprogram, Simplex [42], that the fit minimum obtained is the true one; therefore we are confident that the case of statistically negative results of (iv) does not condition the analysis of the fitting results. The five parameters obtained (Table 4) are indeed nicely correlated. The selectivity to ethane in these experiments is almost constant using MIX5, while with MIX1 initially decreases and then slowly reaches a constant value. From the values of the fitting parameters listed in Table 4 for the two mixtures, it appears that: (i) kl2/k21 ratio for the tail-end mixture (MIX1) is one order of magnitude higher than that obtained with the front-end mixture (MIX5); (ii) the rate constant in the poisoning of the activated sites in tail-end mixture is three orders Table 4 Fitting parameters related to the evolution of the surface catalytic sites Catalyst Gas a a kj, b k2l ` k13 d k23 a ki= / kj mixture (s-') (s-') (s-') (s-') ratio PYa298 MIX 1 3.390) 4.21(2)10-- 8.22(4)- 10-5 8.21(1) 10-- 2.75(3)- 10-4 512 PYa298 MIX5 10.36(4) 8.790) 10-3 2.17(3)10-6 6.95(6)10-2 2.710) 10-7 4050 a This parameter evaluates the reactivity of the activated (XZ) sites with respect to the inactivated (X,) ones. b Rate constant of the transformation inactivated (XI)- activated (X,) sites.

Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 of magnitude higher than that observed for the in front-end mixture; (iii) k23 is much smaller than k,2; (iv) both tail- and front-end cuts lead to the same rate constant in the poisoning of the inactivated sites. These results, therefore, confirm the hypotheses suggested by the preconditioning experiments. Indeed, the activation of sites is faster in front-end than in tail-end mixture (i), deactivation is faster for the same mixture (ii) and the apparent deactivation (represented by the kz3 rate constant) is normally much smaller than the corresponding activation process (represented by k12) (iii). The nature of the irreversible poisoning does not depend on the HZ pressure (iv) being instead controlled by the surface deposition of species such as polymerization products [17,37] not directly related to hydrogen. On the basis of the above evidences a more reliable mechanism, adequate to explain the reaction pathway of the title reaction with the different reaction feedstocks, can be suggested. Further interesting data can be derived by considering the a parameter and the behavior of the X 3 curves of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Since a and the amount of X3, at the steady state, are greater when MIX5 is used, the lower amount of hydrogen (less reactive mixtures) produces a more uniform first layer of reactive carbonaceous species along with a higher number of poisoned sites. No evidence for macroscopical catalyst aging, even at high space velocity, could be observed on Pd/pumice catalysts. Accordingly in Fig. 7 (catalyst PYa298 with MIX1) the experimental points are related to three different sets of data obtained at three different space velocities (63, 156, and 313 s-1). In Fig. 8 a stability test of the catalyst PYa298 performed with MIX5 by changing the space velocity, is presented. Initially the catalyst operated at a space velocity of 1 s-' for 450 min, then the space velocity was increased at 50 s-` for 240 min and finally the space velocity was set again at the initial value (1 s-1) without recording any alteration in v/vo or in the selectivity to ethane. Although other groups have attempted to give a total kinetic model of the title reaction [43,44], our attempt gives a uniform view of the reaction, irrespective of the very different mixtures of gas employed in the industrial processes and of the supported palladium catalyst used. Therefore, a similar reaction mechanism is operating for Pd pumice catalysts using front- or tail-end cuts and this hypothesis could be extended to the other Pd catalysts, at least in the case of tail-end mixtures. The apparent differences in the catalytic behavior are determined by the gas composition of the mixture and probably are related to the relative processes of activation and/or deactivation. It is likely that activation/deactivation processes depend also on the nature and the method of synthesis of the Pd supported catalysts. Therefore, although the catalysts have not the same performance in catalytic hydrogenation of acetylene, the reaction should be characterized by only one mechanism in spite of the macroscopical evidences. The outlined mechanism is not in contrast to the usually accepted mechanism [7,8] which involves the two parallel hydrogenation D. Duca et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 269-284 283 pathways shown in Scheme 1. In fact, it can be considered as an attempt to rationalize such a mechanism on the basis of different types of catalytic sites. 4. Conclusions Pumice supported palladium catalysts appear active, selective and stable in respect of the macroscopical aging phenomena, even at high space velocity, in the selective hydrogenation of traces of acetylene in industrial ethylene rich feedstocks. These conclusions are based on the studies of the influence of metal loading and dispersion, as well as on the method of preparation of the palladium catalysts, on the activity and selectivity in the above reaction with various ethylene rich mixtures. Our results can be summarized as follows: - TOF values increase with the HZ/CZH2 ratio but also SE increases at high H 2/C 2 H 2 ratios; - metal dispersion does not influence the selectivity at any H Z/C 2 H Z ratio; - the influence of the metal loading with the various reaction mixtures shows that the low loaded palladium catalysts give always a better activity/ selectivity pattern; - Pd/pumice catalysts show a remarkable stability: no changes in activity and selectivity were found after running the reaction at high H 2/C Z H 2 ratios and high space velocities. The acetylene hydrogenation proceeds according to a mechanism which apparently depends on the gas mixture composition and although an IKR procedure seems to suggest this occurrence, we pointed out that the mechanism can be uniformed by using a new model approach based on the existence of different types of surface sites. The modification of the active sites during the course of the reaction depends from the hydrogen concentration (i.e. from the tail-end and front-end cuts), but, once this occurrence is taken in account for, all the couples of catalysts /reaction mixtures are governed by the same mechanism. The behavior of Pd/S'02 and Pd/A1203 catalysts is very similar to that of pumice supported palladium catalysts, at least with tail-end cut feedstocks.

Tel.: (+39-91) 616-8261; fax: (+39-91) 616-6281 Pumice supported palladium catalysts were compared with Pd SiO2 and Pd Al2O3 in the hydrogenation of acetylene using typical industrial ethylene feedstocks: front-end and tail-end cuts. Pd/pumice catalysts exhibit good activity and excellent selectivity and stability in the title reaction. Their activity/selectivity pattern is controlled by the composition of the reaction mixture. The turnover frequency (TOF) increases, and the apparent activation energy (E a) decreases, with the H 2 C2H2 ratio, but they are not affected by the C2H2 C2H4 ratio. The selectivity to ethane (S E) does not change with acetylene conversion at low H2 C2H2 ratio (tail-end cut) and increases at high H2 C2H2 ratio (front-end cut). No dependence of S E with acetylene conversion was found, at any H2 C2H2 ratio, on varying the metal dispersion. TOF and S E change with metal loading depending on the reaction mixtures; low metal loaded catalysts gave the best activity/selectivity pattern. Pd/pumice catalysts do not show aging phenomena even when used in drastic conditions (high space velocities and front-end cuts). The catalytic behavior of Pd/pumice catalysts, as a function of the composition of reaction mixture, elucidated by using the isokinetic relationship (IKR) approach shows that the relative amount of hydrogen in the feedstocks plays an important role in activation/deactivation processes which occurs on the metal surface. By considering the presence of different centers on the catalyst and by performing data analysis with a suitable mathematical model, the microscopical mechanism and the role of surface deposits can be explained. A similar reaction mechanism is applicable to the other palladium catalysts, at least in the case of tail-end mixtures.

        "dc:description": "Pumice supported palladium catalysts were compared with Pd SiO2 and Pd Al2O3 in the hydrogenation of acetylene using typical industrial ethylene feedstocks: front-end and tail-end cuts. Pd/pumice catalysts exhibit good activity and excellent selectivity and stability in the title reaction. Their activity/selectivity pattern is controlled by the composition of the reaction mixture. The turnover frequency (TOF) increases, and the apparent activation energy (E a) decreases, with the H 2 C2H2 ratio, but they are not affected by the C2H2 C2H4 ratio. The selectivity to ethane (S E) does not change with acetylene conversion at low H2 C2H2 ratio (tail-end cut) and increases at high H2 C2H2 ratio (front-end cut). No dependence of S E with acetylene conversion was found, at any H2 C2H2 ratio, on varying the metal dispersion. TOF and S E change with metal loading depending on the reaction mixtures; low metal loaded catalysts gave the best activity/selectivity pattern. Pd/pumice catalysts do not show aging phenomena even when used in drastic conditions (high space velocities and front-end cuts). The catalytic behavior of Pd/pumice catalysts, as a function of the composition of reaction mixture, elucidated by using the isokinetic relationship (IKR) approach shows that the relative amount of hydrogen in the feedstocks plays an important role in activation/deactivation processes which occurs on the metal surface. By considering the presence of different centers on the catalyst and by performing data analysis with a suitable mathematical model, the microscopical mechanism and the role of surface deposits can be explained. A similar reaction mechanism is applicable to the other palladium catalysts, at least in the case of tail-end mixtures.",
