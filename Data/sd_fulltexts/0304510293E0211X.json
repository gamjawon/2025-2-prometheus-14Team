(+33)72442852 (Received May 1, 1993; accepted August 10, 1993) Abstract 179 The synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of new materials obtained by reaction of organometallic complexes of groups IIb, IVs, and VIa with the surface of metallic particles are reviewed. Two types of materials may be obtained by surface organometallic chemistry on metals: metal particles covered with organometallic fragments, and bimetallic particles of predetermined composition. Characterization of the organometallic fragments on the metal particles has demonstrated their thermal stability. These particles covered with surface organometallic fragments are new catalytic materials, highly selective in several reactions such as the hydrogenation of a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes, ethyl pyruvate, nitrobenzene, acrylonitrile, and olefins. The bimetallic particles without organometallic fragments are also highly active and selective for a variety of reactions such as hydrogenolysis of various alkanes and hydrogenolysis of esters. For these systems, the concept of \"site isolation\" has been advanced to account for the high selectivity of the reactions. Key words: bimetallic catalysts; custom design; surface organometallic chemistry 1. Introduction Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) is a relatively new field of chemistry which deals with the reactivity of organometallic compounds with surfaces. SOMC differs from organometallic chemical vapour deposition (OMCVD) in that the reactions of SOMC result in less than monolayer coverage of the surface, whereas OMCVD is used to prepare multilayered materials for electronic applications [ 1 ] . Due to its \"monolayer\" character, SOMC has been used to prepare relatively well-defined supported metallic catalysts [ 2-5 ] . The SOMC approach is very general: the organometallic compounds may be complexes of main group elements, transition metals, lanthanides or 'Corresponding authors. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V.

These can be grafted onto the surfaces of oxides (silica, alumina, zeolites, zirconia, etc.), carbon (diamond, graphite or charcoal) or metals. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the application of SOMC to the preparation of bimetallic catalysts [ 4,6 ] . There is a wide variety of possible structures for these bimetallic catalysts. Surface science has been very successful in identifying some of the concepts relevant to bimetallic materials, for example, formation of surface alloys, phase segregation at the surface, decoration of crystallographic sites by adatoms, site sensitive chemisorption and changes in electronic properties, surface diffusion, surface reconstructions, etc. However, careful studies of the reactivity of organometallic complexes towards metallic surfaces have revealed new aspects of the chemistry of bimetallic catalysts. Indeed, a new domain of surface organometallic chemistry on metals is slowly emerging. New fundamental rules of this chemistry are being progressively established, and new materials have been obtained which have no analogues in molecular chemistry, classical heterogeneous catalysis or surface science. In some cases, these new materials exhibit extremely high chemo- or regioselectivity in catalysis. We will show in this short review that the nature of these new catalytic materials depends very strongly on the reactivity of the organometallic compound with the metallic surface. SOMC/metals can yield a metallic surface covered with adatoms or surface organometallic fragments, or an \"alloy\" having the desired composition. An increase in activity and/or selectivity for a given catalytic reaction is frequently achieved by replacing a traditional (mono) metallic catalyst by a bimetallic one [ 7 ] . The origin of this enhancement is not fully understood at the present time. Classical theories attribute these properties to geometric (ensemble effects, \"site isolation\" effects) [8], or electronic (electronic influence of an adsorbed metal on the supported metal) [ 9 ] effects in the bimetallic materials. In our opinion, the effects must be considered in a much broader context of catalysis. Any reaction occurring on a metallic surface should involve, in at least one elementary step, a \"surface organometallic fragment\" in which one or several atoms of the substrate molecule are bonded to one or several atoms of the surface. Scheme 1 represents an organometallic fragment (R-M= ) bound to a surface (X,Y); it is clear that the atomic composition of the surface, especially one with bimetallic character, will influence the reactivity of the surface organometallic fragment. While the role of the two metals can be attributed to either a geometric effect [8] or an electronic effect [9,10] of the second metal on the first one, bimetallic catalysts have to be perfectly homogeneous and precise in composition on an atomic scale. SOMC/M is one possible way to achieve such homogeneity, because high temperature treatments can usually be avoided. The strategy of SOMC/M is to utilize \"controlled\" surface reactions, in which the transformation of monometallic materials into homogeneous bimetallic ones is understood in terms of molecular processes. In this respect, the strategy of J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-2O ,X :~X/ `X`i X, Y Y Y R M Scheme 1. 181 SOMC/M to achieve homogeneity is more closely related to molecular chemistry than to surface science. The monometallic catalyst is first prepared, giving a relatively well-defined metallic surface, which is then allowed to react with an organometallic molecule, the precursor of the second metal in the bimetallic product. Previous attempts at this chemistry [ 11,12 ] involved grafting a group IV or VI metal (e.g., Sn, Ge, Pb, Mo) onto an oxide surface to create the host surface. The metal-modified oxide was then treated with a group VIII organometallic compound (e.g., n-allyl nickel, bis-7r-metallyl platinum). However, the monometallic support was not always very well defined, and therefore the SOMC reaction could not be easily monitored. It is well-known that well-defined group VIII metal particles supported on oxides can be prepared in a fully reduced form. These reduced metallic surfaces are perfect \"host\" surfaces and their use as such will be considered here. The nature of the organic moiety surrounding the organometallic molecule is of great importance in controlling surface reactions. Numerous studies of metal carbonyl complexes have been reported [ 6 ] . However, the reaction of carbonyl complexes with the surfaces of metals inevitably leads to evolution of CO, which is known to poison metallic sites. In 1984, Travers [ 13 ] , Margitfalvi [ 14 ] , and Nuzzo [ 15 ] simultaneously described new preparative routes for bimetallic particles by the reaction of a group IVs alkylmetal compound with a supported metallic surface of Rh, Pt or Ni. We have approached this chemistry by considering at an atomic or a molecular level the chemistry involved in the grafting reaction. We first discovered that the surface reaction strongly depends on whether the surface is oxidised or reduced [ 16 ] . The most reproducible results are obtained when the surface is fully reduced. In this review, we describe the reaction between the metallic surfaces of reduced group VIII metals and alkyl complexes of group II, III, IV and VI metals. Characterization of the various bimetallic catalysts obtained, as well as applications to various hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reactions, is dis- 182 J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 cussed. Precise control of the reaction between the organometallic complex and the surface of the \"host\" metal arises from knowledge of the complete reaction path which governs the geometry and orientation of the incoming molecules, as well as the chemical state of the bimetallic catalyst. 2. Preparation and characterisation of monometallic catalysts The strategy of SOMC/metals requires first the preparation of monometallic catalysts. Si02, Zr02 and A1203 have all been used as support materials. In our laboratory, surface organometallic chemistry of tin and germanium on silica is quite well understood [ 17 ] , and it is therefore feasible to determine whether the organometallic complex reacts on the metallic phase, on the silica support, or both. Determination of such selectivity in SOMC is achieved using solid state NMR among other techniques. Supported group VIII metals can be prepared using conventional ion-ex- change methods followed by H2 reduction (Rh/Si02 [18], Rh/Zr02 [19], Ni/ Si02 [20], Pt/A1203 [21] ) or by the surface organometallic chemistry route (Ru/Si02 [22] ). These monometallic systems have been fully characterised by various physical techniques (e.g., electron microscopy, XPS, EXAFS, Xray diffraction) and by the selective chemisorption of hydrogen. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Reactions between group VIII supported metals (M/oaide)and alkyl complexes of group II, IV and VI metals (M' R ) Reactions between the organometallic compounds M'Rn (M' is Ge, Sn, Pb; Se; Zn; while R is CH3, C2Hg, C,H9) [ 19,21,26,27 ] and the surfaces of reduced supported metals (M is Rh, Ru, Pt/oxide) may occur in one of several ways: (a) The organometallic complex can react under inert atmosphere with the surface of a metal on which hydrogen has been preadsorbed. This approach was used originally by Margitfalvi et al. [ 14 ] . (b) The organometallic complex can react with the metallic surface in the presence of a partial pressure of hydrogen under either static or dynamic conditions. This is the approach that we have used the most in our laboratory. The reaction may occur in the absence of solvent (for example, by sublimation of the organometallic complex onto the surface) or in an inert solvent such as benzene or an alkane. Once adsorbed on the surface in the presence of H2, hydrogenolysis of the organometallic compound occurs between 300 and 400 K. Decomposition of the grafted organometallic fragment generally occurs at much higher temperatures. Usually, if the amount of organometallic complex introduced corresponds to less than a monolayer of the metallic surface, the organometallic complex reacts selectively with the metallic surface rather than with the oxide. However, when an excess of organometallic complex is used, the reaction also occurs on the support to give, for example, possible formation of -Si-O-Sn (n-Bu) 3 [ 28 ] . Generally, the reaction between M' R and M/oxide proceeds via stepwise hydrogenolysis of the M'-R bond with elimination of RH and formation of 183 2 0 273 Temperature (K) y = Sn/Rh 5 x - 0.31 - 0.53 + - 0.71 o . 0.96 i '~ *I 373 473 Fig. 1.

A summary of bimetallic catalysts prepared by surface organometallic chemistry on metals is given in Table 2. Izumi et al. [ 19 ] prepared bimetallic catalysts by the reaction of Se (CHO 2 with Rh/Zr02 (Se/Rh < 0.2) in the presence of molecular hydrogen. Methane elimination began at 373 K and ended at 573 K after/evolution of one equivalent of CH4, yielding surface organometallic comple s with the stoichiometry Rh (SeCH3 ),,/Zr02. Margitfalvi et al. [ 29 ]prepare~their bimetallic catalysts from Sn (C2Hb) 4 and Pt/Si02 (Sn/Pt < 0.5) in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen. During the reaction in benzene, ethane and a small quantity of methane were evolved, leading to a Pt [ Sn (CA)., ]y surface complex. Ethane and a small quantity of ethylene were observed during the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of the grafted Sn(C2H6)x fragments. J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. CataL 86 (1994)179-204 187 Candy et al. [ 16 ] studied the reaction of Sn (n-C4H8 )4 with M/Si02 (M is Ru, Rh or Ni) under H2. In this case, the chemical reaction with the metal surface is again partial hydrogenolysis of tetraalkyltin; because the organometallic fragment remains on the metallic phase, it is both catalyst (or poison ) and reactant in the hydrogenolysis (vide infra). When the Sn/M ratio is less than one, the reaction under ca. 40 mbar HZ in a closed vessel leads to progressive hydrogenolysis of the butyl groups to butane with increasing reaction temperature. At a given Sn/M ratio, a plateau for the amount of butane evolved vs. reaction temperature is observed at ca. 400 K, Fig. 1. Thus, by controlling the reaction temperature, it is possible to prepare a surface organometallic complex with a given stoichiometry, Rh, [Sn (n-CA,)x ]y,/Si02. Figure 2 shows the IR spectra corresponding to the reaction of Sn(n-C4H9)4 with silica supported rhodium. At room temperature, Sn (n-C4H9) 4 is first physisorbed and hydrogen bonding occurs between the alkyl group of the organometallic complex and silanols. At 373 K, the silanol groups of the silica have been consumed by the surface reaction but butyl groups on the metallic particle are easily detected in the v (CH) region. Above 400 K, complete hydrogenolysis of the metal-alkyl bonds occurs, as shown by infrared and volumetric measurements in Figs. 2 and 3. A general reaction pathway for the hydrogenolysis of the adsorbed surface organometallic complexes has been proposed [4,30] as shown in Scheme 2. By systematically varying the quantity of the organometallic compound introduced and the reaction temperature, it is possible to prepare various partially dealkylated catalysts, M [ M' Rx ],,/oxide, with desired values of x and y, as well as the \"alloyed\" bimetallic catalysts, MM;,/oxide, with desired y values. These catalysts have been characterized by a variety of physical techniques and their catalytic properties evaluated in various reactions. 4. Characterization of the bimetallic surface organometallic complexes, M[M' Rjy/oxide Thorough characterization of the bimetallic catalysts is a prerequisite to the rational design of catalysts for industrial processes. It is important to know the chemical state of the two types of metal atoms, as described by their oxidation states, ligand environments, structure and stoichiometry. EXAFS can be particularly useful for structural characterization of the bimetallic organometallic catalyst. For example, Didillon et al. [30] applied EXAFS at the Sn K-edge to the analysis of [Rh.Sn(n-C4H9)2/SiO2 (x=2, y=1) ] . The Fourier transform EXAFS data are consistent with an average of two light atoms (C or O) at 0.217 nm and 2 heavy atoms (Rh or Sn) at 0.268 nm in the primary coordination sphere of the Sn atom. The EXAFS spectra obtained on Rh/Zr02 doped with (CH3) zSe showed that Se atoms are not present in the bulk of the Rh particle, and that the Rha-Se bond length is 0.241 nm [19]. 188 J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 Volumetric measurements of CO adsorption can be used to quantify the number of metal atoms accessible to this probe molecule. Adsorption of CO at 298 K on several materials with the formula [ RhaSn (n-C4H9) x ],, (x = 2; 0 <y < 1) gave the results shown in Fig. 3. A sharp decrease in the amount of adsorbed CO is observed when the Sn/Rh. ratio increases from 0 to 0.3. A plateau is observed for higher values of Sn/Rhs. The results clearly indicate that the metallic rhodium atoms are still accessible to the CO probe molecule. Similar results were obtained for Rh.Se (CH3)/Zr02 [ 19 ] . Infrared studies of the adsorbed CO on Rh.Sn(n-C4H9)2/Si02 have been used to probe the active sites on such catalysts. CO adsorbs on Rh surfaces in two configurations, distinguished by their different v (CO) frequencies. Linearly bonded CO absorbs between 2000-2060 cm -1, depending on surface coverage [ 2 ] , while bridging CO is observed at ca. 1860 cm -1. On RI.Sn (n-C4Hg) 2/ Si02and on the precursor material, Rho/Si02, both linear and bridging CO are present (Fig. 4 ). The relative absorbances for linear and bridged carbonyls are comparable in both samples, suggesting that the Rh surface atoms in the bimetallic material are not isolated from one another [ 30 ] .

The nature of the sites occupied by the second metal deposited by the SOMC route has been further explored by chemical and computational methods [ 23 ] . The segregation of one component of an alloy to the surface is now well established [ 41 ] . For example, for Sn (n-C4H9) 4 reacting with a Rh particle, the Rh surface is gradually converted to a Sn surface. The chemical methods are based on an analysis of the distribution of products obtained from hydrogenolysis reactions of alkanes. Coq et al. [ 23 ] have demonstrated that whereas Ge atoms deposited at Rh by the SOMC route react to give isolated Ge atoms (avoiding formation of Ge-Ge bonds ), they still react preferentially at the lowest coordinated sites, the corner or edge sites. The Sn atoms also occupy the lowest coordinated sites first; additional Sn atoms are constrained to gradually fill in the denser planes of the particle. This gradual conversion of the surface of a cubooctahedral particle is illustrated in Fig. 5. This dilution of the Rh surface is consistent with the results obtained from the disappearance of the bridged CO band in IR spectroscopy [5 ] as discussed above. Mossbauer spectroscopy was performed on the complexes described as 2 Fig. 5. A cubooctahedral particle gradually being covered with Sn atoms.

[ 17 ] . For RheSn (n-C4H9) 2/Si02, the quadrupole splitting is intermediate between X-Sn (n-C4H9) 3 (X is 0 or M) and RhSn alloy [ 45 ] or physisorbed Sn (nC4H9)4 [30]. The Mtisabauer spectra demonstrate the presence of partially dealkylated Sn complexes grafted to oxide-supported \"host\" metals (Rh or Pt). CP-MAS 13C solid state NMR has been used to study the reaction of Sn (nC4H9) 4 with Rha H/Si02, which yields the grafted surface complex Rha [ Sn (nC4H9) x ] y/SiO2. At room temperature, Sn (n-C4H9) 4 physisorbs onto the surface. When the temperature is raised to 373 K, no signals were observed if Sn/ Rhe < 1. For Sn/Rho > 1.5, a weak signal corresponding to the surface complex ---Si-O-Sn (n-C4H9) 3 was observed. These results were interpreted in terms of preferential hydrogenolysis of the Sn(n-C4H9)4 on the metal surface, until the Sn/Rh. ratio approaches unity. At higher Sn/Rha ratios, the metallic surface is close to saturation. Therefore, Sn (n-C4H9) 4 or HSn (n-C4H9) 3 derived from it migrates onto the silica and reacts with silanols to give the complex -Si-0Sn (n-C4H9) 3 [ 30 ] . The organometallic fragment cannot be detected by 13C CP-MAS solid state NMR when it is coordinated to metallic particles larger than - 16-22 A [46] because the paramagnetism of the particle broadens the NMR spectra while the Knight shift may displace the signal by several hundred ppm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the oxidation states of M and M' in some bimetallic M [ M' Rx ] y/oxide species. For Rh[Se(CH3)]y/Zr02, an ethylene hydroformylation catalyst, the Se 3d5/z binding energies correspond to See- and the Rh 3d3/2 and 3da/2 binding energies correspond to metallic rhodium (Table 4). There is no significant change in the XPS spectra after ethylene hydroformylation. Additionally, the binding energies are independent of the Se content in the range studied (0.01 < Se/ Rh < 0.13) [ 20 ] . For the catalyst RheSn (n-C4H9) 2/Si02, the results are summarised in Table 4. The XPS signal was deconvoluted into ca. 75% of Sn' and/ or Sn' and ca. 25% of Sn . The Rh 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 binding energies correspond to metallic rhodium. After complete hydrogenolysis at 623 K, only Sn and Rh were found [ 30 ] . Molecular modelling, while not a conventional method of characterization, can be helpful in evaluations based on geometric compatibility of possible surface structures of organometallic fragments grafted onto metallic surfaces.

Rhodium particle covered with Sn-alkyl groups fully selective for the hydrogenation of citral to geraniol. The atoO are, yellow: Rh; green: Sn; white: C; blue: H. Molecular modelling studies were done in order to determine the most plausible structures for the surface complex formed from the reaction of tetraalkyl Sn with the rhodium surface to give Rhe [ Sn ( n-C4H9 ) 2 ]y/5102 [ 30 ] . Possible structures for this average formula are given in Scheme 3. The simplest models, (a): Rhe[Sn(n-C4H9)2] and (b): (Rhe)2Sn[Sn(nC4H9)2], are too sterically crowded when constructed with the observed Sn/ Rhe ratio of 1. A more complex model in which the butyl groups are farther away from the rhodium particle, relieving steric hindrance at the surface, was proposed ( c ) : ( Rhe ) 2Sn [ Sn ( n-C4H9 ) 3 ] 2. A space filling model representation of (c) is shown in Fig. 6. This model, which is in general agreement with the other structural data obtained, allows CO access to surface rhodium atoms (shown in yellow). However, the modelling results cannot rule out the possibility of a mixture of surface species. b. Characterisation of bimetallic systems obtained by complete hydrogenolysis of the surface organometallic fragment: M[M' ftx],,/ oxide Decomposition of M [ M' Rx ],,/oxide species under H2 ( flowing or static ) at high temperatures leads to bimetallic MMy/oxide compounds. Comparison J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 193 of HZ and CO adsorption capacities at 300 K for M/oxide and the corresponding MM;,/oxide shows a sharp decrease in the amount of HZ or CO adsorbed with the amount of M' (y) introduced [ 16,21,30 ] . Electron microscopy of various M/oxide samples and the corresponding MM;,/oxide materials shows that the average metallic particle size in the bimetallic catalysts is slightly higher than the average metallic particle size in the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Typical particle size histograms obtained for silica-supported Rh,Sn,,, RuSny and NiSny indicate that there is an increase in size of each metallic particle when Sn is introduced [ 16 ] . Nevertheless, this slight increase in particle size cannot account for the pronounced decrease in H2 or CO adsorption capacity. Using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (EDAX), it was demonstrated that the bimetallic particles have a homogeneous composition and that Sn is never observed alone on the carrier [ 16 ] . Adsorption of CO has been used as a probe of Rh accessibility for RhSn/ Si02 formed by heating RhaSn(n-C,H9) 2/Si02 under HZ at 623 K. Only one IR band is observed at ca. 2000 cm-1, due to linearly bonded CO. The band ascribed to bridging CO (see above, Section 4) is not present. This result implies that formation of the Sn-Rh alloy suppresses formation of bridging CO by \"site isolation\" of Rh atoms from their neighbours [ 2,30 ] . Moasbauer spectroscopy has been used to characterise PtSn,/A1203 catalysts obtained by reaction of Pt-H/A1203 with Sn (n-C,H9) 4 in deoxygenated benzene at 323 K followed by heating under flowing H2 at 773 K. The MOssbauer spectra recorded at 77 K were decomposed into two singlets. The first, near zero velocity (8=0.11 mm s-1), was identified as non-atoichiometric Sn02, while the second, with 8=1.64 mm s-1, was attributed to a PtSny alloy with an average composition close to Pt3Sn [ 42 ] . The relative area fractions for the two ainglets are 1/4 (first/second). The presence of oxidized Sn was attributed to surface contamination of the catalyst by a minor amount of 02. Computational methods have also been used to characterise bimetallic catalysts. Site segregation in small M' Rh bimetallic particles was studied by linear combination of gaussian type orbitals, mixed potential, local spin density (LCGTO-MP-LSD) calculations. Small model clusters of M' Rh were studied. When M' is Sn , the M' atoms segregate to low coordination sites (corners and edges), but when M' is Ge, there is a completely random distribution of M' in Rh [ 23 ] . These results support the idea that Sn can selectively inhibit reactions catalyzed by low coordination sites on Rh. 6. Catalytic reactions 6.1.

Catal. 86 (1994)179-2O 195 different products can be obtained from each isomer: cis or trans dimethyl-3,7octen-2-al, nerol (from the cis isomer) or geraniol (from trans), and citronellal, as shown in Scheme 4 for the trans isomers. These can be further hydrogenated, as indicated by the arrows in Scheme 4. A variety of Rha [ Sn (nC4H9)x]y/SiO2 bimetallic catalysts for the controlled liquid phase hydrogenation of citral have been obtained by partial hydrogenolysis of Sn (n-C4H9) 4 on the surface of Rh/SiO2 [ 27 ] . Figure 7 illustrates the dependence of the catalytic activity and selectivity for citral hydrogenation on the number of butyl groups remaining on the catalyst (x) and on the ratio [ Sn (n-C4H9) x ] to Rhs (y). Judicious control of x andy gave control of the activities and selectivities for any of the three products (Scheme 4 ); the maximum activity and selectivity for the formation of geraniol is observed for x= 2 and y=1 [ 36 ] . Alkyl chains remain bound to the surface even after catalysis. Characterisation (see Section 4) revealed that the majority of the Sn atoms have an oxidation state > II (probably IV) [50], as had been found previously for a SnPt/Nylon catalyst prepared from a non-organometallic precursor [51-53 ] . When Ge (n-C4H9) 4 was used as an organometallic precursor, results were similar to those obtained with the Sn analogue. However, addition of Pb(nC4H9)4resulted in nearly complete poisoning of the Rh surface and loss of catalytic activity. Significantly, Ge(n-C4H9)x fragments can be grafted onto the Rh surface, while under the same conditions there is a total hydrogenolysis of the butyl groups of Pb (n-C4H9) 4 [ 37 ] . There are presently several possible interpretations of the spectacular effect of the organometallic fragment on the activity and selectivity on the hydrogenation of a,ss unsaturated aldehydes. The most commonly proposed hypothesis is that the Lewis acid properties of the Sn atoms activate the carbonyl group, which then becomes more reactive than a C=C double bond. Additionally, the presence of the organometallic fragment may favour the approach of the substrate to the catalyst via its carbonyl group, which is less sterically hindered (ill-coordination) than approach by the C=C double bond (tlz-coordination ). Alternatively, the Sn atoms may poison some specific Rh metal sites which are active for C=C hydrogenation. This may occur either by interaction of Rh with adsorbed Sn organometallic fragments or by formation of a solid solution. Hydrogenation of ethyl pyruuate Enantioselective hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate has been studied on Pte[SnR(4-x)]y/A1203 (R=CH3 and C2H5) catalysts in the presence of hydrocinchonidine [38]. It was found that the SnR(4-x) moieties have a relatively weak effect on the optical yield of the reaction, but have a marked effect on the rate of hydrogenation. It appears that the maximum catalytic activity is obtained for a relatively low Sn/Pt. ratio of 0.025. 196 J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-2O Selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline proceeds through phenylhydroxylamine or diphenylhydrazine intermediates [ 54 ] . Coq et al. studied the hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene by M' M/A1203 (M is Pt and M' is Sn, Zn, Al, or M is Rh and M' is Sn or Pb) obtaining good selectivity but low activity. It was recently shown that hydrogenation of nitrobenzene under mild conditions over a Rh, [ Sn (n-C4H9) 4 ] /SiO2 catalyst gives a 100% yield of aniline [34,35]. The hydrogenation rate is six times greater than over a Rh/Si02 catalyst. If RhSn/Si02 catalysts (obtained by total hydrogenolysis of Sn(nC4H9) 4 on Rk/19i02 catalyst at 673 K under H2) are used, no conversion of nitrobenzene occurs. The low selectivity for aniline on monometallic catalysts may be tentatively explained by poisoning of the surface by dimers (e.g. azobenzene, diphenyl hydrazine) which are not converted to aniline. The presence of numerous organometallic fragments on Rha [ Sn (n-C4H9) 4 ] /SiO2 would prevent adjacent adsorption of two molecules of nitrobenzene, avoiding dimerisation reactions. Nevertheless, the first step of nitrobenzene hydrogenation requires adjacent rhodium atoms to form adsorbed nitroso and nitrene species [55]. As demonstrated by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, the presence of bridging CO is observed on the monometallic catalyst and on Rhe [ Sn (nC4H9)4]/Si02, but not on the bimetallic catalyst, RhSn/Si02. The concept of \"site isolation\" [3,56] could explain why there is no reaction of nitrobenzene on the bimetallic material. A geometric effect, created by the presence of Sn surrounded by organic alkyl chains, could explain the high selectivity of RhB [ Sn (n-C4H9) 4 ] /Si02. However, a possible electronic effect, arising from the electropositive Sn (Sn II or Sn\") cannot be ruled out. Using Nylon supported PtSn catalysts, Galvagno et al. [ 57 ] obtained good yields of aniline and an increase of activity for Sn/Pt ratio of ca. 0.1. They suggested that at low Sn content, Sn acts as a promoter by activating the nitro group. Hydroformylation of ethene Propanal and propanol (and ethane) were formed during ethene hydroformylation on the catalyst obtained by the reaction of Se (CHO 2 with Rh/ Zr02 [ 19 ] . During the catalyst preparation, one equivalent of methane is evolved to yield Rh (SeCH3 )y/Zr02. During the initial hydroformylation reaction, acetaldehyde was also produced by the reaction between CO and the remaining methyl group; this was not observed in subsequent runs. The maximum turnover frequency and the maximum selectivity for propanol formation was obtained for a Se/Rh ratio of 0.07. At this optimum Se/Rh ratio, the turnover frequency for propanol formation was about 70 times that observed for the Rh/Zr02 catalyst. For Se/Rh > 0.1, hydroformylation did not occur to a significant extent. Hydroformylation rates did not increase with Se/Rh when the SeRh/Zr02 catalysts are prepared by co-impregnation of Rh(N03)3 and Se02 on Zr02 in aqueous solution. It was suggested that the increase in selec- J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mot. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 197 tivity and activity of the SeRh catalyst obtained by SOMC/M is due to Se2ions present on the surface which favour the CO insertion step. By comparison, hydroformylation of ethylene at 408 K on Rh/Si02 and Rh-Fe/Si02 catalysts (prepared in a flow mode Pyrex glass reactor under atmospheric pressure, by decomposition of either Rh4 (CO )12 clusters or (NMe3Bz) Fe,nRhz(CO)16 (n=1, m=1, x=5 or n=2, m=2, x=4) bimetallic clusters onto silica) shows remarkable Fe promotion for oxygenate formation [ 58 ] . The observed enhancement is interpreted as a two-site interaction of Cand O-bonded CO with Rh-Fe3+ sites generated from bimetallic clusters supported on silica. Hydrogenation of acrylonitrile Active and very selective bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation of acrylonitrile to propionitrile (95% selectivity) at 373 K were obtained by the reaction between reduced Ni/A1203 and Pb (C2Hg) 4 [ 31 ] . The bimetallic catalyst was described as NixPb(CZHb)4_y. The optimum selectivity occurred with a Pb concentration of ca. 6% weight. The value of y was not precisely determined, but temperature-programmed reaction studies showed that ethane was evolved when the catalyst was heated above 373 K. While the effects of the Pb and of the remaining alkyl groups was not discussed, the active catalyst may be covered by an organometallic fragment. 6.2. Catalysis on surfaces of bimetallic catalysts: \"alloys\" Hydrogenolysis of n-hexane Coq et al. [21 ] studied n-hexane hydrogenolysis at 533 K on a catalyst prepared by the addition of a small amount of Sn(n-C4H9)4 in n-heptane solution to a Pt/A1203 catalyst. Addition of 0.11 or 0.25 Sn atoms per Pt greatly reduced the catalytic activity, shifting the reaction from central bond fission to demethylation and increasing the yield of cyclization. At this temperature, catalysis occurs essentially on the metallic surface, as demonstrated by similar turnover values obtained for Pt/Si02 [ 59 ] and Pt/A1203 [60 ] catalysts of similar dispersion. These results confirm that SOMC/M can be used to selectively bind Sn to Pt surface atoms and perhaps form a surface or bulk alloy. Hydrogenolysis of 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane (TeMB) Hydrogenolysis of 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane (TeMB) by M'M/A1203 (M is Pt and M' is Sn, Zn, Al, or M is Rh and M' is Sn or Pb) is very sensitive to the topology of the metallic surface as previously demonstrated [ 61 ] on a RhCu system. On small Pt (1.2 nm) or Rh (1-2 nm) particles supported on alumina, 2,2,3-trimethylbutane and methane are formed in large amounts. For larger particles of Pt ( > 3 nm) or Rh ( > 4 nm ), isobutane is the main product [ 21 ] . As demonstrated by Coq et al. [21 ], the addition of small amounts of tetra-nbutyltin, diethylzinc or triethylaluminum, to small Pt particles supported on alumina clearly favours the formation of isobutane. Similar behaviour was ob- 198 J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 served for Rh [ 23 ] and Ru [ 39 ] when small amounts of Sn or Pb are added. It was suggested that the M' metal atoms selectively inhibit the reactions catalysed on sites of low coordination, and are mostly present on small metallic particles as corners and edges. Therefore, the \"inactive\" M' atoms introduced by SOMC must be located on low coordination sites of the platinum or rhodium particles, as suggested by theoretical calculations [ 23 ] . At high Sn content, the SnM/A1203 catalysts show behaviour similar to that of pure small Rh or Pt metal particles, but are almost inactive for TeMB hydrogenolysis. This may be attributed to a poisoning effect of Sn, which decreases the number and the size of metal particle sites [ 23 ] . Methylcyclopentane (MCP) hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation It has been demonstrated that hydrogenolysis reactions of MCP are very sensitive to the structure of the catalyst [ 62 ] . Coq et al. [ 21 ] studied the hydrogenolysis of MCP with M'M/A1203 (M is Pt, M' is Sn, or M is Rh, M' is Pb, Ge) . The hydrogenolysis was performed at elevated temperatures (513 K for Pt, 493 K for Rh) and under 1 atm H2. For SnPt/A1203, addition of large amounts of Sn (Sn/Pt=0.11-0.36) slightly favours non-selective ring opening of MCP to form n-hexane. A similar effect is seen with large amounts of Ge (Ge/Rh=0.70) or GeRh/A1203. The catalyst PbRh/A1203 (Pb/Rh=0.37) favours selective ring opening, giving 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane as products. This modification in behaviour can be rationalised in the same way as the effect on TeMB conversion (see above), although modification of the catalytic properties is much less pronounced for MCP [21,23]. Margitfalvi et al. [29] studied the dehydrogenation of MCP with several different types of SnPt/A1203 catalysts. The main reaction products were methylcyclopentenes, methylcyclopentadienes and benzene. The reaction was carried out at 793 K in the presence of 1 bar H2. The catalyst preparations differed mainly in the amount of Sn on the A1203 support. The formation of benzene was hindered but not totally inhibited when Sn was introduced onto the support. Suppression of benzene formation requires that both the acidic support sites and metallic sites be blocked by Sn. Therefore, both the support and the metal particle contain active sites for ring enlargement. Selective hydrogenolysis of esters to alcohol& the concept of \"site isolation\" Hydrogenolysis of esters is difficult to achieve either by homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis.

However, the extreme conditions required by these catalysts (high temperature and high pressures) lead to non-selective hydrogenolysis with formation of acids, alcohols and hydrocarbons. MSn/Si02catalysts (M is Rh, Ru or Ni) with various Sn/M ratios (from 0 to 4 ), obtained by reaction of Sn ( n-C4H9 ) 4 with M/Si02 [ 16 ] , have very different catalytic properties compared to the monometallic catalysts M/Si02. By increasing reaction temperatures up to 573 K, the butyl groups of the organotin fragment are fully eliminated and transformed into butane and, when Sn/Rho > 1, some butenes. From IR studies of adsorbed CO on the bimetallic particles (see Section 5 ), it was proposed that the Rh surface atoms (Rhe) are isolated from each other by Sn atoms. This catalyst was found to be very selective for hydrogenolysis of ethyl acetate into ethanol [ 33 ] . Depending on J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 201 whether the C-C or C-O bond cleavage occurs during hydrogenolysis, ethanol, acetic acid or CO + hydrocarbons can be obtained, as shown in Scheme 5. RC (O)-OR' bond cleavage is the most facile, leading to alcohol formation. It is well known that addition of Sn depresses the hydrogenolysis properties of group VIII metal catalysts [56]. Figure 8 shows the activity and selectivity in catalytic conversion of ethyl acetate versus Sn content of the RhSn,, catalysts. The increase of Sn in the MSn/Si02 (M is Rh, Ru and Ni) catalysts leads to a marked increase in selectivity toward ethanol formation, as shown in Table 5. The rate of ethanol formation sharply increases for Sn/M > 0.2 when M is Rh or Ni, or > 1 when M is Ru [ 32,33 ] . In this range of Sn content, a simple geometric \"ensemble\" effect cannot by itself explain the results. A new catalytic material whose concentration increases with increasing Sn content, presumably an alloy of RhSn, seems to be responsible for the observed high activity and selectivity. A combination of kinetic studies and physical observations (see Section 4) suggests \"site isolation\" of Rh surface atoms in a matrix of Sn atoms. This concept is equally valid with Ni and Ru. The mechanism proposed for the ester hydrogenolysis, based on the concept of \"site isolation\" and the primary products determined by kinetic experiments [33], is depicted in Scheme 6. Coordination of the carbonyl oxygen atom to the rhodium leads first to the transfer of one hydrogen atom to the carbonyl carbon atom. In the second step, the alkogy-rhodium undergoes a concerted transformation leading to acetaldehyde and ethogide. The ethogide is then hydrogenated to ethanol. 7. Conclusion In the course of this short review article, we have considered various aspects of SOMC/M. The first conclusion that can be drawn is that the relevant metal particles are able to react with a variety of organometallic complexes to give a new material in which some organometallic fragments can bind to the particle. This is an unexpected result. In several cases, the organometallic fragment is thermally stable up to fairly high temperatures. Characterisation of the organometallic fragment grafted to the surface of the metal particle has been achieved and there is now ample evidence to demonstrate such phenomena. The fact that a thermally and chemically stable organometallic fragment can be grafted at the surface of a metal particle opens a new field of investigation in heterogeneous catalysis by metals. As a demonstration of this potential, several catalytic reactions (hydrogenation of citral to geraniol and nerol, hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline, etc.) become much more selective when a metallic surface is derivatised with an organometallic fragment. It has been clearly established that even after catalysis, the organometallic fragment remains on the surface. The role of the organometallic fragment, while not yet 202 J.-P. Candy et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)179-204 completely understood, is its ability to impart to the catalyst a chemical specificity, such as regio- chemo- or stereo-selectivity, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, etc. The subject is just beginning to be explored fully. The organometallic preparative route also gives remarkable results for another class of material, the well-defined \"alloys\" of predetermined composition. Such \"alloys\" are also important catalysts for a wide variety of reactions. In these \"alloys\", the active transition metal is apparently surrounded by inactive main group elements, leading to the simple concept of \"site isolation\". These isolated sites lead to high selectivities in several reactions such as hydrolysis of alkanes or esters. There is no doubt that this new field of heterogeneous catalysts prepared by surface organometallic chemistry on metals to give alloys, is also slowly emerging. There are still some technological problems to overcome before these new materials can be applied on an industrial scale, but the exceptionally high degree of selectivity obtained will certainly be a driving force to overcome difficulties in the science of catalyst preparation.

The synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of new materials obtained by reaction of organometallic complexes of groups IIb, IVa, and VIa with the surface of metallic particles are reviewed. Two types of materials may be obtained by surface organometallic chemistry on metals: metal particles covered with organometallic fragments, and bimetallic particles of predetermined composition. Characterization of the organometallic fragments on the metal particles has demonstrated their thermal stability. These particles covered with surface organometallic fragments are new catalytic materials, highly selective in several reactions such as the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ethyl pyruvate, nitrobenzene, acrylonitrile, and olefins. The bimetallic particles without organometallic fragments are also highly active and selective for a variety of reactions such as hydrogenolysis of various alkanes and hydrogenolysis of esters. For these systems, the concept of “site isolation” has been advanced to account for the high selectivity of the reactions.

Two types of materials may be obtained by surface organometallic chemistry on metals: metal particles covered with organometallic fragments, and bimetallic particles of predetermined composition. Characterization of the organometallic fragments on the metal particles has demonstrated their thermal stability. These particles covered with surface organometallic fragments are new catalytic materials, highly selective in several reactions such as the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ethyl pyruvate, nitrobenzene, acrylonitrile, and olefins. The bimetallic particles without organometallic fragments are also highly active and selective for a variety of reactions such as hydrogenolysis of various alkanes and hydrogenolysis of esters. For these systems, the concept of “site isolation” has been advanced to account for the high selectivity of the reactions.",
