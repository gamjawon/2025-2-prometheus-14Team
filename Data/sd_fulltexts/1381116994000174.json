The catalysts were activated by several procedures in order to correlate the oxidation state of Moor W, as characterized by XPS, and the acidic character, as determined by IR of adsorbed pyridine, with the main metathesis reaction and side olefin reactions. The catalytic activity of the samples under standard conditions was found to be invariant with the pretreatment (air or He). This leads to the conclusion that the activation of catalysts takes place under the propene atmosphere during the first minutes of reaction. XPS studies of fresh and spent catalysts showed that the active sites for metathesis seem to be W(VI) or Mo(VI) species. Both Mo03/A1203 and W03/Z03 catalysts are active in parallel reactions such as polymerization, isomerization and cracking. The product distribution for the metathesis reaction differed greatly from that expected. Thus, for all catalysts the ethene/butene ratio is lower than 1 and isobutene was the main component of the CQ fraction, its proportion increasing with the metal oxide content. Studies by IR of adsorbed pyridine showed the Brsted acid sites generated on Mo03 or W03 in samples with high metal oxide content to be responsible for the lateral acid-catalyzed reactions.

Introduction Metathesis, isomerization, cyclopropanation and polymerization reactions are closely related alkene transformations. The metathesis of olefins has been a widely studied process due to its academic and industrial interest [ 1-5 ] . The metathesis technology affords interesting possibilities for the synthesis of valuable organic compounds which are difficult to obtain by other methods [ 6 ] . * Corresponding author. Tel. ( + 34-3 )4021235, fax. ( + 343)4111492. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSD/1381-1169(94)00017-4 Tungsten oxide and molybdena based catalysts have received considerable attention due to their high metathesis activity and because they provide a close relation between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Most of the mechanistic studies of the reaction have been performed on homogeneous systems and have shown that metal carbene complexes are intermediates [ 7,8 ] . It has also been widely accepted that analogous metal carbene species are formed on the surface of heterogeneous oxidic catalysts [ 9,10] . However, extremely divergent conclusions have been drawn 148 1. Rodriguez-Ramos et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995)147-154 concerning the oxidation state of the metal which is part of the active carbene site. For supported M03 (M = MO, W) catalysts, the oxidation states suggested are 0 [ 11 ] , + 2, + 3 [ 12,13 ] , + 4 [ 1418 ] , + 5 [ 19-21 ] and + 6 [ 17,18,22-24 ] . Therefore, this is still a subject of debate which merits further clarification. On the other hand, olefin metathesis is usually accompanied by several competing parallel reactions involving the reacting olefins such as reduction, dehydrogenation, carbon deposition . . . [ 25 ] . Few studies [ 21 ] dealing with this carbon deposition problem have been reported so far in the literature. The present paper studies comparable series of alumina-supported Mo- and W-based catalysts with a wide range of M03 loadings in the metathesis of propene. The catalysts were activated by several procedures in order to correlate the oxidation state of Mo or W, as characterized by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the acidic character, as determined by IR of adsorbed pyridine, with the main metathesis reaction and side olefin reactions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation A Girdler y-alumina with a low impurity content and a surface area of 188 m2 . g-1 was used as support. Support was sieved between 0.4 and 0.75 mm and catalysts were then prepared by the incipient wetness method from neutral 11202 solutions of (NH4) 6M07024 . 41120 or (I~H4)2W4013' 81120. The solution concentrations were to have 3, 6, 10 and 15 nominal weight% on M03 (M = Mo, W). The impregnated samples were dried under air from room temperature up to 393 K for 24 h and then calcined in air at 50 K - h-' up to 873 K for 3 h. Similarly, but using a D 11-11 BASF silica as support, a sample with a nominal 15 Wt% W03/S'02 was prepared for comparison. In Table 1, the M03 contents of the catalysts are resumed and the nomenclature of the samples is illustrated.

Catalytic activity Catalytic tests were performed in a single-pass (differential) fixed-bed microreactor system at 101 kPa (1 atm) of total pressure. The operating mode was similar for all catalysts. A catalyst sample, 0.25-1 g was placed in the reactor and then pretreated under air or helium flow at temperatures between 873 K and 1073 K for 1 h. Once the catalyst was cooled to the reaction temperature, 573 K or 773 K, high purity propene was admitted at 20 ml - min-'. Reactant conversions were less than 3%, so mass and heat transfer limitations were avoided. The reactor effluent was analyzed by gas chromatography using a Varian 3400 GC equipped with an automated and heated on-line gas sampling valve. In all cases, a study of the activity and selectivity over the reaction time was done. Overall conversion is defined as the total amount of propene converted to other products, while metathesis conversion is defined as the amount of propene converted to C2 and C4 olefins. Ethene and butenes (1-C4, i-C4, t-C4, c-C4) selectivities are calculated as the amount of propene converted to the product divided by the total amount of propene converted to C2 and C4 olefins. 2.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XP spectra were recorded with a Fisons ESCALAB MKII 2008 spectrometer equipped with a Mg Ka X-ray excitation source 1. Rodrfguez-Ramos et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995)147-154 (hv=1253.6 eV) and hemispherical electron analyzer. The samples were turbopumped to ca. 10-3 N m-2 and then moved into the analysis chamber. The residual pressure in this ionpumped chamber was maintained below 2 x 10-' Nm-2 during data acquisition. A 20 eV energy region of the photoelectrons of interest were signal-averaged for a number of scans in order to obtain good signal-to-noise ratios at reasonable acquisition times. Although surface charging was observed in all samples, accurate ( f 0.2 eV) binding energies (BE) could be determined by charge referencing with a C is at 284.9 eV or a Au 4f peak at 83.8 eV. 2.4. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) a E z The infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5ZDX Fourier transformed spectrophotometer with a resolution of 4 cm-t. Self-supporting wafers of the samples with weight-to-surface \" s ratios of about 10 mg cm-2 were placed in a a~ vacuum cell assembled with greaseless stopcocks a and KBr windows. The adsorption of pyridine was effected after evacuation of materials at 723 K for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the samples were exposed to 2 Torr (1 Torr=133.3 Pa) of pyridine vapour at room temperature for 5 min, and then outgassed at 473 K for 1 h. The IR spectra were recorded at room temperature. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic activity It is well known that activity of catalysts for metathesis reaction is sensitive to pretreatments with various gases under different operating con ditions [26]. In Figs. lA and 1B, the influence of the gas (air or He) for catalyst activation on the specific activity in the propene conversion under standard reaction condition is presented. Besides the transformation of propene to metathesis prod ucts (ethene and butenes), parallel reactions such as cracking, carbon deposition and polymerization 149 s 2 0 A \"1_~ o so 10 el 2- 100 150 200 250 t (min) IY o' o so too t (min) 150 200 Fig. 1.

Then the overall activity ( j.cmol of total propene converted per gram of metal oxide and per second) and metathesis activity (/.cmol of propene converted to C2 and CQ olefins per gram of metal oxide and per second) for 3WA (Fig. 1 A ) and 3MoA ( Fig. 1 B ) catalysts ate plotted as a function of time on-stream. It is seen that catalytic activities measured after air treatment at 773 K for 1 h are very similar to those resulting from the inert gas activation ( He at 873 K for 1 h). The overall activities increase with the time on-stream and become constant after 2 h, whereas the metathesis activities are stable over time. 3WA 150 12I p 81 g a 4 50 100 150 t (min) 200 250 Fig. 2.

Rodriguez-Ramos et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 95 (1995)147-154 and 3MoA catalysts display a very similar type of behaviour, although the latter shows a higher level of activity in the propene reaction and is invariant with the pretreatment ( air or He). In principle, thermal treatment under He is expected to generate active sites in the metathesis reaction, especially for catalysts containing a greater amount of metal oxide, since they are more easily reduced [ 27,28 ] . However, this is not the case. It is concluded that the activation takes place under the propene atmosphere, and given that the metathesis activity is constant with the process time, the active sites are created during the very early time of reaction. These findings agree with those reported for Mo03/A1203 catalysts where no influence of the reduction degree on the metathesis activity was detected [ 29 ] . In addition, on alumina-supported W03 or Mo03 catalysts [ 17,18 ] , it has been suggested that the active sites of metathesis can be formed starting from W ( VI) or Mo( VI) species, probably in a tetrahedral coordination. The influence of transition metal content on the stability of the catalyst with the time on-stream is shown for the W03 catalysts pretreated in air at 773 K for 2 h in Fig. 2. A similar picture can be obtained for the Mo03 catalysts. The catalysts display a similar metathesis activity in spite of their very different W03 content. This indicates as has been established before that the portion of active sites for the metathesis reaction is low and occupies only a small fraction of the catalyst surface [ 29 ] . However, the overall catalytic activity increases with the metal oxide content, so the generated species in these samples catalyze other reactions such as polymerization and cracking. The coke formation, which produce a relatively strong coloration of the catalysts after reaction, leads to a decline in the overall activity. Fig. 2 shows that the higher the overall activity, the higher the deactivation of the catalyst. But active sites for metathesis are not destroyed by the coke deposition. The selectivity to metathesis products for W03 and Mo03 catalysts as a function of the metal oxide content is illustrated in Figs. 3A and 3B 1.

Influence of the time on-stream on the total activity (open symbols) and metathesis activity (filled symbols) at reaction temperature 773 K on 15WS (O, and 15WA (0, catalysts pretreated in a helium flow at 973 K for I h. respectively. For all catalysts a ethene/butene ratio of less than 1 is always found. The 3MoA and 3WA catalysts show an ethene/butene ratio closer to that of propene metathesis. But this ratio decreases markedly with the increasing metal oxide content. This indicates that after metathesis reaction, dimerization of ethene may take place. Analysis of the butenes formed revealed that the isobutene is the main component of the C4 fraction and the portion of isobutene increases with the metal oxide content. Besides isobutene, the 2butenes (traps and cis) and 1-butene are present. For all catalysts the trans/cis 2-butene ratio corresponds to equilibrium [ 30 ] . It is known that acid centers of y-alumina may be active in olefine polymerization and isomerization reactions. However, when y-alumina was reacted with ethene under the experimental conditions used in the propene reaction, ethene was dimerized only in a minor extent and no isobutene was detected. Consequently, the polymerization, isomerization and cracking reactions must be catalyzed by acid sites generated on the tungsten oxide or molybdena in catalysts with high loading. Similar results have been reported by Tsuda et al. [ 31] who found that over unsupported W03 below about 600 K dimerization was the dominant reaction. A completely different picture is found when W03 is supported on silica. In Fig. 4 the specific activity at 773 K of 15WSi and 15WA catalysts 151 pretreated in He at 973 K for 1 h is plotted as a function of the reaction time. The 15WSi catalyst has a high selectivity ( - 92% ) to metathesis reaction. The product distribution corresponds to that expected for metathesis. The ethene/butene ratio is equal to one and the butene distribution is as expected from thermodynamic considerations. Moreover, the 15WSi shows almost constant activity, while the 15WA deactivates over time. The inferior performance of W03 on alumina compared to silica may be due to the high interaction of the W03 with the alumina, which produces very different catalytic active species. 3.2. IR characterization Studies by IR of pyridine adsorbed on the catalysts were performed in order to determine the nature (Brsted or Lewis) and the strength of the acidic centers present. Fig. 5 displays the IR spectra of catalysts after adsorption of pyridine. The 3WA and 3MoA catalysts have Lewis (1455 cm-') acid sites, while both Brsted (1545 cm- t ) and Lewis (1455 cm-' ) sites are present in 15MoA and 15WA catalysts. The presence of Brsted acid sites in samples with high Mo03 or W03 content is probably associated with the for- 1 0.2 C C C .C l600 l500l400 Wavenumber () Fig. 5.

These octahedral structures easily trap the H20 coming from the dehydroxylation of the alumina and form stable hydroxyl groups which remain after treatments in He at 973 and 1073 K. The hydroxyl groups likely block the active sites for metathesis and give reactions typical of acid sites, such as polymerization, isomerization and cracking. 3.3. XPS characterization A study of the fresh and spent Mo03 and W03 catalysts was done by . In Fig. 6, spectra of the W 4f levels for fresh (Fig. 6A) and spent (Fig. 6B) catalysts are presented. For the Mo03 catalysts the Fig. 7 summarizes the XP spectra of the Mo 3d level. The BE values are listed in Table 2. From the BEs of the principal W 4f. ( - 35.7 eV) and Mo 3d5,2 ( = 232.8 eV) peaks, it can be deduced that all the samples, either fresh or spent, show only the presence of W ( VI) or Mo ( VI) . These findings are in accordance with an early ESR and kinetic study on Mo03/A1203 (24) in which the Mo( VI) sites are found to be the active species for the olefin disproportionation. These results also agree with those of Griinet et al. who proposed that the active sites for metathesis can be formed from W(VI) and Mo(VI) precursors [ 17,18 ] . Nevertheless, on the basis that only a fraction of the active component is involved in the catalytic sites of metathesis, the presence of other species such as W ( V ) or Mo ( V ) in a proportion below the limit of detection of the cannot be excluded. However, the almost constant catalytic activity with the pretreatment ( air or He) support the conclusion that the W ( VI) or Mo ( VI) species are the active sites for the metathesis activity.

It is seen that deviations from the monolayer prediction already occur below the theoretical monolayer coverage. In fact, for samples with higher metal oxide content, peaks corresponding to W03 were observed by X-ray diffraction. For the M003 similar behaviour can be described. 4. Conclusions Alumina-supported tungsten and molybdenum oxide catalysts were studied in propene metathesis. The catalytic activity of the samples under standard conditions is invariant with the pretreatment (air or He). This finding leads to the conclusion that the activation of catalysts takes place under the propene atmosphere during the first minutes of reaction. XPS studies of fresh and spent catalysts show that the active sites for metathesis seem to be W (VI) or Mo(VI) species. Both Mo03/A1203 and W03/A1203 catalysts are active in parallel reactions such as polymerization, isomerization and cracking. Therefore, the product distribution obtained was quite different from that of the metathesis reaction. For all catalysts the ethene/butene ratio was less than 1 (the expected value from the stoichiometric reaction: 2 C3H6 -j C2H4 + C4H8) and isobutene was the 153 main component of the C4 fraction, its proportion increasing with the metal oxide content. Studies by IR of adsorbed pyridine showed the Brsted acid sites generated on M003 or W03 in samples with high metal oxide content to be responsible for the lateral acid-catalyzed reactions.

Tel. (+34-3)4021235, fax. (+34-3)4111492. Alumina-supported tungsten and molybdenum oxide catalysts with a wide range of MO3 loadings were studied in the metathesis of propene. The catalysts were activated by several procedures in order to correlate the oxidation state of Mo or W, as characterized by XPS, and the acidic character, as determined by IR of adsorbed pyridine, with the main metathesis reaction and side olefin reactions. The catalytic activity of the samples under standard conditions was found to be invariant with the pretreatment (air or He). This leads to the conclusion that the activation of catalysts takes place under the propene atmosphere during the first minutes of reaction. XPS studies of fresh and spent catalysts showed that the active sites for metathesis seem to be W(VI) or Mo(VI) species. Both MoO 3 Al 2 O 3 and WO 3 Al 2 O 3 catalysts are active in parallel reactions such as polymerization, isomerization and cracking. The product distribution for the metathesis reaction differed greatly from that expected. Thus, for all catalysts the ethene/butene ratio is lower than 1 and isobutene was the main component of the C4 fraction, its proportion increasing with the metal oxide content. Studies by IR of adsorbed pyridine showed the Brønsted acid sites generated on MoO3 or WO3 in samples with high metal oxide content to be responsible for the lateral acid-catalyzed reactions.
