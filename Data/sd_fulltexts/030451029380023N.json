Springman Amoco Oil Company, Amoco Research Center, P.O. Box 3011, Naperville, IL 60566 (USA) (Received August 24, 1992; accepted December 21, 1992 ) Abstract Alumina supported V205, Mo03, Fe203, Fe203-Vz05, and M003-V205 catalysts were investigated by Raman spectroscopy as a function of calcination temperature under ambient conditions where the surfaces are hydrated. The single metal oxide systems (V205, Mo03, or Fe203) and the mixed metal oxide systems (Fe203-V205 and Mo03-V205) are present as surface metal oxide species on the alumina support at intermediate calcination temperatures. For the single metal oxide species, the surface vanadium oxide species consists of metavanadate species ( [V03]n ), the surface molybdenum oxide species consists of heptamolybdate (Mo1024 ) and octamolybdate (Mo8026 ) species, and the surface iron oxide species is primarily present as a surface spinel containing Fe\" ions in the surface region of the alumina support. Addition of iron oxide and molybdenum oxide to the V205/A1203 transforms the surface metavanadate species to surface pyrovanadate species (V207- ) and surface decavanadate species (V1002a ), respectively. The thermal stability of the supported metal oxide on the alumina support depends on the specific nature of the surface metal oxide species. The supported iron oxide on alumina has a high thermal stability, similar to the unpromoted alumina, which is probably related to Fe\" absorption into the surface region of the alumina lattice. In contrast, the supported molybdenum oxide on alumina system is not stable above 800 C due to significant loss in the alumina surface area and volatilization of molybdenum oxide. The surface vanadium oxide species on alumina is stable up to a calcination temperature of 800 C and transforms to crystalline V205 at higher calcination temperatures due to significant loss in surface area of the alumina support. The mixed metal oxide species (Fe203-V205 and Mo03-VZ05) on alumina could not stabilize the surface vanadium oxide on alumina above 800 , and accelerated the rate of surface area loss and phase transformations. No FeV0,1, AIV04, or V-Mo-O compounds were formed in these mixed metal oxide species on alumina at elevated temperatures.

All rights reserved. 64 J.-M. Jehng et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 Introduction Supported V205 and M003 catalysts have been found to be effective catalysts for many catalytic reactions such as selective oxidation and ammoxidation of hydrocarbons, selective reduction of NO,,, hydrodesulfurization and hydrocracking of crude oil, as well as isomerization and hydrogenation of alkenes [ 1-6 ] . The V205 and M003 deposited on oxide supports (such as A1203, Ti02, and Si02) form a two-dimensional surface vanadium oxide or molybdenum oxide overlayer [ 7-13 ] . The interaction of the surface vanadia (or molybdena) species and the oxide support has a pronounced effect on the catalytic properties of the supported vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide catalysts. It is also known that these surface metal oxide species on oxide supports are stable to high calcination temperatures [ 13-16 ], and can prevent or accelerate the dehydroxylation as well as loss in surface area of the oxide supports [ 1518]. Recent Raman studies on the supported vanadia catalysts with different vanadium oxide coverages reveal that the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are influenced by the addition of a second metal oxide such as molybdenum oxide or iron oxide [ 19 ] . Under hydrated conditions, the transformation of surface metavanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 937 cm-1) into surface pyrovanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 885 cm-1) occurs upon the addition of the basic surface iron oxide species and the transformation of surface metavanadate species into surface decavanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 990 cm-1) occurs upon the addition of the acidic surface molybdenum oxide species. In the present study, Raman spectroscopy was used as the characterization technique to discriminate among the various metal oxide molecular structures of Mo, V, and Fe as well as provide information about the alumina support phases. A single surface metal oxide (5 wt. % Fe203, 5 wt. % V205, or 5 wt. % Mo03) supported on A1203 and calcined from 500 C to 950 C was investigated by Raman spectroscopy in order to determine the thermal behavior of the surface metal oxide and alumina support phases during high calcination temperature treatments. The effect of a second metal oxide (5 wt.% M003 or 5 wt. % Fe203) on the molecular structures and thermal behavior of the surface vanadium oxide (5 wt.% V205/A1203) and alumina support phases was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy as a function of calcination temperature. Experimental Materials The precursors used in the preparation of the supported metal oxide catalysts were: ammonium heptamolybdate, (NH4)6Mo7O24-4H20 99.9 wt.% (Alfa, Danvers, MA); vanadium triisopropoxide, VO(OC3H7)3 95-99 wt.% J.-M. Jehng et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 65 (Johnson Matthey, Ward Hill, MA); iron nitrate nano-hydrate (EM Science). The oxide supports used in this study were y-A1203 (Harshaw, ca. 180 m2/g) and PHF y-A1203 (Cyanamid, ca. 196 m2/g). Preparations The catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. For the non-air sensitive molybdenum precursor, an ammonium heptamolybdate/water solution was impregnated into the y-A1203 (Harshaw) support. The wet samples were then dried at room temperature for 16 h, dried at 120 C for 16 h, and calcined at 500 C for 16 h. For the air sensitive vanadium precursor, a vanadium triisopropoxide (Alfa, 95-99 wt.%) in isopropanol (Mallinckrodt, 0.028 wt.% H20) solution was impregnated into the PHF yA1203 (Cyanamid) support under a nitrogen environment to avoid the crystallization of the precursor with atmospheric water, and the impregnated samples were kept in a glove box for 2 h to evaporate the excess alcohol. The samples were subsequently dried at 120 C for 16 h under flowing N2 and calcined at 500 C under flowing dry air for 2 h. The mixed Mo03 and V205 on the y-A1203 (Harshaw) support catalyst was prepared by a two stage impregnation method using the non-air sensitive molybdenum precursor for the first stage as mentioned above, and a vanadium triisopropoxide/methanol (Fisher Scientific, 99.9 wt.%) solution was then impregnated into the Mo03/A1203 catalyst. The sample was subsequently dried at 120 C for 16 h under flowing N2 and calcined at 500 C under N2 gas for the first hour, then switched to the dry air for additional 15 h. Iron-based catalysts were prepared by dissolving iron nitrate nano-hydrate in methanol (Aldrich, 0.04 wt.% H20 ),drying overnight in flowing nitrogen using a small fixed-bed quartz tube, and calcining at 500 C for 2 h under flowing dry air. The mixed Fe203andV2O5on the PHF y-A1203 (Cyanamid) support catalyst was prepared by first impregnating with vanadium precursor. After the drying procedures, the sample was impregnated with iron precursor, dried overnight in flowing nitrogen, and calcined at 500 C for 2 h under flowing dry air. All samples were further calcined at high temperatures from 700 C to 950 C for 2 h under flowing dry air. Raman spectroscopy Raman spectra were obtained with a Spex triplemate spectrometer (Model 1877) coupled to an EG&G intensified photodiode array detector which was cooled thermoelectrically to - 35 C, and interfaced with an EG&G OMA III Optical Multichannel Analyzer (Model 1463). The samples were excited by the 514.5 nm line of an Ar+ laser (Spectra Physics Model 171) with 10-100 mW power. The laser beam was focused on the sample disk, where the sample typically spins at about 2000 rpm to avoid local heating, in a right-angle scattering geometry. An ellipsoid mirror collects and reflects the scattered light into the spectrometer's filter stage to reject the elastic scattering. The scat- 66 J.-M. Jehng et al. /J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 tered Raman light was analyzed with an OMA III software package. The overall spectral resolution was determined to be better than 2 cm-1. The detailed schematic diagram of the Raman spectrometer is described elsewhere [ 20 ] . Results and discussion The molecular structures of the hydrated surface metal oxides were found to depend on the point of zero charge (PZC) or the net pH at which the surface possesses zero charge [ 9 ] . The PZC of a supported metal oxide system is determined by the combined pH of the oxide support and the metal oxide overlayer. Consequently, oxide supports possessing a low pH at PZC, corresponding to an acidic environment, predominantly form octahedrally-coordinated surface vanadia species (VIO02$ ), and oxide supports possessing a high pH at pzc, corresponding to a basic environment, predominantly form tetrahedrallycoordinated surface vanadia species (V04-, V20.4,-, and (V03)xn)for supported vanadia catalysts [9 ]. The model of the net surface pH at PZC can also predict the molecular structures of other surface metal oxides (surface rhenium oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, and surface niobium oxide) on various oxide supports under ambient conditions where these surfaces are hydrated [9,21 ]. Single metal oxide species on alumina V205/ AL203 The effect of calcination temperature on the Raman spectra of the 5 wt.% V205/A1203 (PHF) sample is shown in Fig. 1. The Raman bands at ca. 937, ca. 825, ca. 550, ca. 350, and ca. 220 cm-1 are characteristic of a hydrated surface vanadium oxide species which possesses a tetraherally-coordinated metavan- 1 o 934~ l \\ O'1 szs 900 C 830 892 ~ ~ 771 250 5% V205/A1203 800 C 93' \\ \"\"'~'~.~ goo c 825 \\ 532 353 220 500 C zzo 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 Raman Shift (cm-') Fig. 1.

The surface vanadium oxide species is stable to a temperature of 800 C, however, after the 900 C calcination treatment the surface vanadium oxide species transforms to crystalline V205 (Raman bands at ca. 994, ca. 702, ca. 527, ca. 404, and ca. 284 cm-1). In addition, the transformation of y-alumina to 8 or O-alumina is also detected by the appearance of a Raman band at ca. 250 cm-1 which is characteristic of 8 and 0 alumina phases [ 8,22,23 ] . XRD analysis confirms that a O-alumina phase as well as a trace of crystalline V205 are present after the 900 C treatment [ 24 ] . The BET surface area of the 5 wt.% V205/AI203 (PHF) sample decreased from 191 to 44 M2 /g as the calcination temperature increased from 500 to 900 C (see Table 1) .This suggests that the presence of the surface vanadium oxide species accelerates the surface area loss of the alumina support, since relatively little surface area loss occurred on the pure alumina (PHF) calcined at 900 C (from ca. 191 to ca. 161 m2/g, see Table 1). The broad Raman feature appearing at ca. 771 cm-1 is assigned to a monomeric tetrahedral species with a longer V-O bond due to the presence of sodium ions on the B-alumina surface [8 ] . The presence of monomeric tetrahedral vanadia species also indicates that the phase transformation of y-A1203 to O-A1203 was accompanied by some surface segregation of sodium [ 8 ] . Sodium is usually present as a trace impurity in alumina, and the surface sodium concentration increases from y to a-A1203due to the migration of sodium from the bulk to the surface of alumina at high calcination temperature [8]. Solid state 51V-NMR studies on the 5 wt. % V205/AI203 (PHF) sample at different temperature treatments in 500-900 C are also in agreement with the above Raman results [ 24 ] . Thus, the surface vanadium oxide species are stable up to 800 C calcination treatments, and the transformations of the surface vanadia species to crystalline V205 as well as y-A1203 to B-A1203 occur between 800 0 C and 900 0 C.

Jehng et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 M003/A1203 The influence of calcination temperature on the Raman spectra of the 5 wt. % Mo03/A1203 (Harshaw) sample is presented in Fig. 2. The Raman bands at ca. 950, ca. 850, ca. 320, and ca. 215 cm-1 are characteristic of a hydrated surface molybdenum oxide species which possesses an octahedrally-coordinated structure (a mixture of Mo7 024 and Mo$ 026 [ 6,9,11,12,25 ] . Raman studies reveal that only surface molybdenum oxide species are present up to 950 C, and no crystalline M003 (major Raman bands at ca. 994 and ca. 820 cm-1) or the compound A12 (Mo04 )3 (major Raman bands at ca. 1037, ca. 1004, and ca. 380 cm-1) are present. Recent high resolution NMR studies on the 18 wt. % Mo03/A1203 sample calcined at about 700 C suggest that the compound A12 (MO04)3 forms on the alumina surface at high molybdenum oxide loadings [26]. Thus, the absence of the compound A12(M004)3 for the 5 wt. % Mo03/ A1203 sample at 950 C is probably due to the low molybdenum oxide coverage or the decomposition of the compound A12 (M004) 3 at this high calcination temperature. Upon calcination at 800 C, a trace of 8 or e-alumina is also detected by the appearance of a weak Raman band at ca. 250 cm-1. After the 950 C calcination treatment, all the Raman bands in the 850-200 cm-1 region are characteristic of the 8 or 9-alumina phase. In addition, the BET surface area measurements on the 5 wt.% M003/A1203 (Harshaw) sample calcined at 950 C reveal that the presence of the surface molybdenum oxide species accelerate the surface area loss of the alumina support (from ca. 180 to ca. 34 m2/ g, see Table 1) compared to the surface area loss of the pure alumina (Harshaw) calcined at 950 C (from ca. 180 to ca. 94 m2/g, see Table 1). However, only 1 wt.% M003 remains on the alumina support after the 950 C calcination treatment, and the surface density of surface molybdates in the 5 wt- % Mo03/ A1203 sample calcined at 950 C (ca. 1.23 X 102 Mo atom/m2 ) remains ap- _h sso 5% Mo03/A1203 c 840 T 95ss _E2 742 950 C 562 450 Q `-' 848 260208 T 750 560 c _,~8 0 0 f'( 950 650 C - 850 320 215 1r 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 Raman Shift (cm 1) Fig. 2.

Consequently, the volatilization of crystalline M003 at high temperatures results in the absence of crystalline M003 for the Mo03/Al203 (Harshaw) sample calcined at 950 C. Fe2Og/A4203 The Raman spectra of the 5 wt.% Fe203/A1203 (PHF) sample as a function of calcination temperature are shown in Fig. 3.

Jehng et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 match any reference iron oxide compounds in Table 2 and is assigned to a surface iron oxide species. Complementary Mossbauer studies suggest that Fe\" ions are present on the alumina surface [ 24 ] . Increasing the calcination temperature somewhat enhances the intensities of the Raman bands at ca. 770 and ca. 560 cm-1 and is probably related to the distortion of the surface iron oxide species. It appears that the surface iron oxide species are stable to high calcination temperatures, and no indications of the phase transformation from y-alumina (Raman inactive) to 8,0-alumina (Raman bands at ca. 837 (m), ca. 753 (m) , and ca. 251 (s) cm-1) is observed [8]. The stability of the alumina support for the 5 wt.% Fe203/AI203 sample under high temperature treatments was also confirmed by XRD and BET measurements [ 24 ] . The molecular structure of the surface iron oxide species is not expected to be a function of the surface pH of PZC because it is not present as a hydrated overlayer, but is incorporated into the surface of the alumina support. Thus, the absorbed Fe 3+ ions and a trace of crystalline a-Fe203 coexist on the alumina support at all temperatures. In summary, the above studies demonstrate that the metal oxides are atomically dispersed on the alumina support after preparation at 500 C, with the exception of a trace of Fe203 crystallites, and that the thermal stability of the supported metal oxide catalyst depends on the specific nature of the surface metal oxide species. In Table 1, the Fe203/AI203 (PHF) sample retains 85% of its surface area and does not undergo an alumina phase transition after calcination at 900 C. However, the V205/A1203 (PHF) system calcined at 900 C possesses only 23% of the surface area of the original alumina (PHF ) support and the surface vanadia species are transformed to crystalline V205. Similarly, the M003/A1203 (Harshaw) system calcined at 950 C possesses only 19% of the surface area of the original alumina (Harshaw) support and the surface molybdena species are transformed to crystalline M003 which are volatile. The surface metal oxide species which remain coordinated to the support are stable to high calcination temperatures due to a strong interaction with the oxide support. The phase transformation of y-alumina to 8 or O-alumina also accompanies the loss in surface area for the alumina supported vanadia and molybdena catalysts at high temperature treatments. Mixed metal oxide species on alumina Fe203/v205/A1203 The 5 wt.% Fe203/5 wt.% V205/A1203 (PHF) sample calcined at 500 C transforms a majority of the hydrated surface metavanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 937 cm-1) into the hydrated surface pyrovanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 885 cm-1) due to the basic nature of the surface iron oxide [ 19 ] . At higher calcination temperatures (700-800 C) , the surface metavanadate (major Raman band at ca. 932 cm-1) and surface pyrovanadate (major Raman band at ca. 892 cm-1) species coexist on the alumina support under ambient conditions as shown in Fig. 4.

After the 900 C calcination treatment, crystalline V205 is formed on the alumina surface. No information about the alumina support is provided because the color of the sample prevents detection of the phase of the underlying alumina support. XRD studies on this Fe2O3/VZOS/A12O3 m><xed oxide catalyst indicate that the y-A1203 phase is transformed into the 8,x-A12O3 phase after this thermal treatment. Raman, XRD, and 51V-NMR studies are in agreement with the presence of crystalline VZOS for the m><xed Fe2O3/V2O5/A12O3 System after the 900 C calcination treatment [ 24 ] . In addition, the BET surface area measurements on the 5 wt.% Fe203/5 wt.% V2O5/A12O3 sample calcined at 900 C reveal that the presence of iron oxide further accelerates the surface area loss of the mixed Fe203/V205/A1203 system (from ca. 190 to ca. 6 m2/g, see Table 1) compared to the surface area loss of the 5 wt.% V2O5/A12O3 sample calcined at 900 C (from ca.191 to ca. 44 m2/g, see Table 1). The strong Raman cross-section of vanadium oxide overshadows the Raman signal of iron oxide. Raman studies reveal that multiple surface vanadium oxide species are present on the alumina surface under ambient conditions, and their relative concentrations are dependent on the calcination temperature. The presence of Fe3+ ions in the V2O5/A12O3 system as a solid solution was determined by Mossbauer spectroscopy [ 24 ] . The addition of the basic iron oxide into the hydrated V205/A1203 system also affects the molecular structures of the surface vanadium oxide species, and preferentially forms the surface pyrovanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 892 cm-1) or the surface monomeric tetrahedral vanadium oxide species (major Raman band at ca. 800 cm-1). The surface vanadium oxide species are stable up to a temperature of 800 C. No 72 J.-M. Jehag et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 FeV04 or AIV04 compounds are detected on the alumina surface by Raman, XRD, and \"V-NMR measurements. M003/V205/A1203 Comparison of the hydrated Raman spectra Of V205/A1203 (Fig. 1) and M003/V205/A1203 (Fig. 5) reveals that the addition of the molybdenum oxide to the V205/A1203 system converts the surface metavanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 937 cm-1, see Fig. 1) into the surface decavanadate species (a shoulder on the Raman band at ca. 990 cm-1, see Fig. 5) due to the acidic nature of the surface molybdenum oxide species. The hydrated surface decavanadate species, with a VIO02g structure, and the hydrated surface molybdenum oxide species, with a MO80zs structure, coexist on the alumina support [ 19 ] . Upon increasing the calcination temperature to 700 C, the surface decavanadate species (a shoulder on the Raman band at ca. 990 cm-1) and the surface molybdenum oxide species (major Raman band at ca. 960 cm-1) are stable on the alumina surface as shown in Fig. 5. At the higher calcination temperature of 800 C, the disappearance of the Raman band at ca. 960 cm-1 and the absence of the Raman features of crystalline Mo03 indicate that volatilization of the surface molybdenum oxide species has occurred. After the 900 C calcination treatment, a small amount of crystalline V205 (Raman bands at ca. 991, ca. 700, ca. 520, ca. 405, ca. 282, and ca. 148 cm-1) is present and a monomeric tetrahedral vanadate species (Raman band at ca. 760 cm-1) is also present due to the loss in surface area and surface segregation of sodium ions at these high temperatures [8], respectively. In addition, the MO03/V205/ A1203 (Harshaw) system calcined at 900 C possesses only 0.6% of the surface area of the original alumina (Harshaw) support (see Table 1) [ 18 ] . 5% M003/ 520 o 5% V205/A1203 760700 9000C 'c 991 7009 660 405 303 251 206 780 695 496 320 258 x,5,8 992 .N 800 C C 835 760 320 990 585 j 980 820 700 C 625 308 240 o 5000C 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 Raman Shift (CM- 1) Fig. 5.

Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 73 Raman studies on the MO03/V205/A1203 system reveal that the hydrated surface vanadium oxide as well as the hydrated molybdenum oxide species coexist on the alumina surface. The presence of an acidic molybdenum oxide in the V205/A1203 system affects the molecular structures of the surface vanadium oxide species, and preferentially forms the surface decavanadate species (major Raman band at ca. 990 cm-1). The surface vanadium oxide species are stable up to a temperature of 800 C but the surface molybdenum oxide species become volatile at this temperature. The above studies demonstrate that the mixed metal oxides are atomically dispersed on the alumina support after preparation at 500 C, and that no bulk mixed oxide phases (FeV04 or V-Mo-O compounds) are present. Addition of iron oxide and molybdenum oxide affected the surface vanadium oxide molecular structure and thermal stability of the supported mixed metal oxide system. The various vanadium oxide molecular structures present under ambient conditions in the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 3 as a function of catalyst composition and calcination temperature. The addition of iron oxide to the supported vanadium oxide catalyst favored the transformation of surface metavanadate species to surface decavanadate species. These structural transformations are due to the changes in the net pH at surface point of zero charge of these hydrated overlayers [ 9 ] . In all cases, calcination at 500-950 C resulted in the transformation of the majority of the surface vanadium oxide species to crystalline V205 due to the significant loss in surface area of the catalysts at these temperatures. Comparison of the BET surface areas of the above mixed metal oxide species on the alumina support calcined at 900 C indicates that the mixed Fe203/V205/A1203 system has greater thermal stability than the M003/V205/A1203 system (see Table 1).

Jehng et al./J. Mol. Catal. 81 (1993) 63-75 The accelerated surface area loss of the mixed metal oxide systems compared to the single metal oxide systems is probably due to the enhanced surface diffusion of vanadia species and sintering of the alumina support at higher calcination temperatures [ 24 ] . Consequently, the thermal stability of a supported metal oxide system is dependent on the surface metal oxide-support interaction. Conclusions The formation of a single surface metal oxide species (V205, Fe203, or Mo03) and mixed surface metal oxide species (Fe203-V205 or Mo03-V205 ) on the alumina support at intermediate temperatures (500-800 C) were determined by Raman spectroscopy under ambient conditions where the surfaces are hydrated. The single metal oxide species (V205, M003, or Fe203) and the mixed metal oxide species (Fe203_V205andMOO3_V205) are present as surface metal oxide species on the alumina support at intermediate calcination temperatures. For the single metal oxide species, the surface vanadium oxide species consists of metavanadate species ( [ V03 ] n ), the surface molybdenum oxide species consists of heptamolybdate (Mo7024 ) and octamolybdate (Mo8026 ) species, and the surface iron oxide species is primarily present as a surface spinel containing Fe 3+ ions in the surface region of the alumina support. Addition of iron oxide and molybdenum oxide to the V205/A1203 transforms the surface metavanadate species to surface pyrovanadate species (V207- ) and surface decavanadate species (V1o028 ), respectively. The thermal stability of the supported metal oxide on the alumina support depends on the specific nature of the surface metal oxide species. The supported iron oxide on alumina has the highest thermal stability among these catalysts, similar to that of the unpromoted alumina support. In contrast, the system of molybdenum oxide supported on alumina is not stable above 800 C due to a significant loss in the alumina surface area and volatilization of molybdenum oxide. The surface vanadium oxide species on alumina is stable up to a calcination temperature of 800 C and transforms to crystalline V205 at higher calcination temperatures due to a significant loss in surface area of the alumina support. The mixed metal oxide species (Fe203_V205andMOO3_V205)on alumina could not stabilize the surface vanadium oxide on alumina above 800 C, and accelerated the rate of surface area loss and phase transformations. No FeV04, AIV04, or V-Mo-O compounds were formed in these mixed metal oxide species on alumina at elevated temperatures.

For the single metal oxide species, the surface vanadium oxide species consists of metavanadate species ([VO3] x− n ), the surface molybdenum oxide species consists of heptamolybdate (Mo7O6− 24) and octamolybdate (Mo8O4− 26) species, and the surface iron oxide species is primarily present as a surface spinel containing Fe3+ ions in the surface region of the alumina support. Addition of iron oxide and molybdenum oxide to the V2O5/Al2O3 transforms the surface metavanadate species to surface pyrovanadate species (V2O2− 7) and surface decavanadate species (V10O6− 28), respectively. The thermal stability of the Supported metal oxide on the alumina support depends on the specific nature of the surface metal oxide species. The supported iron oxide on alumina has a high thermal stability, similar to the unpromoted alumina, which is probably related to Fe3+ absorption into the surface region of the alumina lattice.
