Graphical Abstract A series of supported Ir-Re catalysts have been synthesized and used for the hydrogenation of adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol. The influences of supporting materials and the Ir/Re atomic ratio on the catalytic performances have been studied. Results suggested that Ir-Re supported on carbon materials and alumina had appropriate acid sites and better activity for the hydrogenation of adipic acid. Compared to the monometallic catalysts, synergistic interaction was generated and electrons were delivered from Ir to Re. The uniform distribution of metal particles in the Ir-Re catalysts and the well restrained H2-spillover effect facilitated the transformation of adipic acid and the selective production of 1,6-hexanediol. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol was 59% with complete conversion of adipic acid at 180 °C in 10 MPa H2 after reaction for 16 h. After four times of reaction, the selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol only decreased about 4%. Keywords Hydrogenation Ir-Re catalyst Adipic acid 1,6-hexanediol Synergistic interaction Introduction 1,6-hexanediol, as a valuable intermediate to fine chemicals, can be applied in a variety of industries [1–3]. Especially in recent years, the market requirement for 1,6-hexanediol increases greatly due to its raising consumption in the Asia-Pacific region. Conventional production of 1,6-hexanediol from adipic acid is processed mainly by a two-step process: (i) esterification between adipic acid and methanol; (ii) selective hydrogenation of dimethyl adipate (DMA) to synthesis the 1,6-hexanediol. However, the second step went through severe reaction conditions under higher H2 pressure (10-20 MPa) in the temperature range of 250-350 °C, using traditional copper-chromium or zinc-chromium catalysts with toxicity [4,5]. Although the precious metal based catalysts were found efficient for the two-step hydrogenation [6–9], the separation of organic solvent and the pre-esterification significantly increased the raw cost. During the past decades, direct hydrogenation of carboxylic acids to their related alcohols is becoming a preferential pathway [10–12]. Recent work suggested that catalyst derived from copper on phyllosilicate displayed preferential selectivity to 1,6-hexanediol compared to the traditional Cu/SiO2 by impregnation method [13]. Addition of Ni with the total Cu + Ni loading of 40 wt% further promoted the turnover frequency (TOF) to 15.1 h-1 [14]. The positively charged Cu+ species in the reduced sample was claimed responsible for the higher TOF value. Considering the availability factor of metal atoms and the possible minimization of metal pollution, precious metals are even appealing [15]. Early practical studies confirmed their high-performances to transform one or even a mixture of dicarboxylic acids into diols [16,17]. One of the precious metal- rhenium, has high affinity to adsorb the carboxyl groups and improves effectively the hydrogenation of benzene ring-containing carboxylic acid, fatty acid, and dicarboxylic acid, especially if promoted by a secondary precious metal [18–23]. The carboxylic groups in fatty acids could be hydrogenated controllably to either alcohols or alkanes by the Re-Pd bimetallic catalyst depending on the reaction conditions [24]. The specific interaction between bimetals changed the particle sizes and suppressed the agglomeration of particles [25]. It was also reported that the Re species was preferred to be enriched on the surface of Pt, resulting in the enhanced hydrogenation rate of C = O bond and higher selectively to unsaturated alcohol [26]. Takeda and co-workers [27] applied the Re-Pd catalysts with 14 wt% Re for the selective hydrogenation of adipic acid. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol reached 74% within 96 h under 8 MPa H2. It was also suggested that different from the monocarboxylic acid, the presence of dicarboxylic acids caused the excessive oxidation of Re species and as well as the lower activity. Typical research studies by Tomishige and co-workers have been focused on the Ir-ReOx catalysts for a variety of hydrogenation reactions. It was previously reported that monometallic Ir catalyst usually performed lower activity for hydrogenation reactions than other precious metals, e.g. Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd [28]. Current work revealed the wide range of hydroconversion ability of Ir species for the unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and its excellent activation performance for C = O bonds [29–31]. Compared to the monometallic Ir sample, the bimetallic samples displayed much enhanced synergistic interaction between metals, with superiority for the activation and selective hydrogenation of C = O, -O-C-CH2OH, C-O [32–36]. Liu et al. regarded the Ren+ species as the main active sites to adsorb the reactant and deactivation could be happened if the Re sites were covered by Ir species [33]. No matter how, the direct hydrogenation of adipic acid- a six-carbon dicarboxylic acids, brings great challenges compared to monocarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid and pentanedioic acid. The longer chains of adipic acid make the easier formation of by-products such as gaseous products (e.g. CO2, CH4, C2H2 etc.), cyclization compounds, and macromolecular compounds by condensation/polymerization processes [27]. The functional roles of bimetallic Ir-Re catalysts with higher atomic utilization during the hydrogenation of adipic acid are still needing investigation. In this work, a series of Ir-Re bimetallic samples have been synthesized and used for the hydrogenation of adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol. The influences of the supporting material and the Ir/Re atomic ratio on the hydrogenation process have been revealed. The functional roles of the chemical composition and the surface property of catalyst have been studied and correlated with the catalytic performances. Materials and methods Catalyst preparation A series of Ir-Re bimetallic catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. 0.05 M aqueous solution of ammonium perrhenate (NH4ReO4) and 0.02 M acetylacetonate (C15H21O6Ir) in acetone were used as the metal precursors. Certain amounts of the above solutions were mixed and dissolved in 50 ml distilled water to get the required Ir/Re atomic ratio with total metal loading of 3 wt%. After mixed uniformly, 1 g of support was impregnated in the aqueous solution. After sonication under stirring for 30 min, the sample was aged at room temperature for 16 h. The catalyst was dried subsequently in an oven at 110 °C for 10 hours without wash or filter process. The as-synthesized bimetallic samples were denoted as IrxRey/M with the theoretical atomic ratio of Ir/Re as x: y. M denoted the supporting materials including the AC-p (pristine activated carbon), AC (HNO3 oxidized activated carbon), CNT (carbon nanotubes), SBA-15, and Al2O3. For comparison, monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples were also prepared by the same method. Before each characterization and reaction evaluation, the tested sample was pre-reduced in 40% H2/Ar gas mixture at 400 °C for 4 hours, with the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Catalysts characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a 7000S at 40 kV and 100 mA with a scan speed of 10 °/min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with the Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope to investigate the morphology and particle sizes of the catalysts. XPS was conducted by the ESCALAB™250Xi with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The temperature-programmed reactions were performed by the Quantachrome ChemStar3000 equipment. The catalyst was preliminarily kept at 30 °C for 30 min in Ar to remove the impurity. In the H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), after the temperature was cooled down, the reduction process was carried out in 10% H2/Ar and the data was recorded from 50 °C to 900 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. In the ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and H2-TPD experiments, after the pre-purging of Ar, the tested sample was kept in the adsorption gas atmosphere (5% NH3/He for NH3-TPD and 10% H2/Ar for H2-TPD) at 50 °C for the full adsorption. The desorption process was subsequently carried out and recorded from 50 °C to 900 °C. Before each experimental test, the sample was pre-reduced in H2/Ar stream at 400 °C for 2 h except the H2-TPR, to get the identical state of the catalyst as those for the catalytic reaction. Evaluation of catalytic performance The aqueous phase hydrogenation of adipic acid was operated in a hastelloy autoclave equipped with magnetic stirrer, heater and controller. The reaction solution consisted of 0.5 g adipic acid dissolved in 19.5 g deionized water. 0.2 g catalyst pre-reduced at 400 °C for 4 h in H2/Ar stream was consumed for each reaction time. After the reactor was charging and discharging with hydrogen for three times, the reactor was finally filled with hydrogen under the desired pressure. The stirring speed was kept at 800 rpm. After the reaction was finished, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature. The composition of the final products in the liquid phase solution were analyzed by Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, RID-20A) and the gas chromatography (Agilent GC-7890). The conversion of adipic acid x A , selectivity S i and the relative yield s Y i of different products were calculated by the following equations: C o n v e r s i o n x A = n 0 - n t n 0 × 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y S i = n i n 0 - n t × 100 % Y i e l d Y i = x A × S i × 100 % Where n0 represents the initial number of moles of adipic acid and nt represents the number of moles of adipic acid after reaction. ni represents the number of moles of product i. Results and discussion Influences of supporting materials for the Ir-Re catalysts A series of bimetallic Ir-Re samples on different supports have been synthesized with theoretical metal loading of 3 wt%. The structures and crystal phases of typical samples are detected by the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 1 a. In the Ir1Re1/SBA-15 catalyst, two diffraction peaks can be observed in the range of 20-60°. The broad diffraction peak at 23.5° is related to the amorphous silica. The diffraction peaks of Ir (111) plane and Re (101) plane should appear at 40.5° (JCPDS 06-0598) and 42.9° (JCPDS 05-0702), respectively [32,37]. However, only one small and dispersive peak at about 42.5° is observed in the Ir1Re1/SBA-15, which is a sign of the co-existence of interacted Ir-Re compositions [32,38]. Two broad diffraction peaks at 20-30° and 40-50° related to the (002) and (100) crystal faces of amorphous carbon can be observed in carbon supported samples [39,40]. It is not easy to identify the formation of Ir and Re species due to the overlap of diffraction peaks by amorphous carbon. For more confirmation, monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples are also synthesized and detected by XRD as shown in Fig. 1b. Although the intensive carbon peaks in the range of 40-45° overlap the metal peaks, the different shapes of peaks are observed probably due to the formation of metallic species. A shoulder peak appears at 25-27° in both the monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples, indicating the possible existence of metal species in oxidation states [41,42]. TEM images was carried out to further confirm the surface information (Fig. 2 ) and the distribution of the metal species. The TEM images of Ir1Re1/CNT and Ir1Re1/AC suggest the fine particles on the surface of carbon materials. The average particle sizes of Ir1Re1/CNT and Ir1Re1/AC are 4.2 nm and 4.7 nm, respectively. The TEM image of the Ir1Re1/SBA-15 clearly illustrates the ordered mesoporous structure of the SBA-15. However, particles are aligned or even aggregated in the Ir1Re1/SBA-15 sample. Simultaneously, very few numbers of particles can be observed in the Ir1Re1/SBA-15, which is mainly due to the sintering of particles during thermal treatment. It is worth to note that the carbon materials and SBA-15 are both supports with acidity (point of zero charge < 7.0) [43]. In fact, the acidity of carbon materials should be related with its surface oxygen groups as reported everywhere [43,44], which may be responsible to interact with the metal precursor and cause the fine dispersion of metal species. The pure supports such as silica, alumina and carbon materials do not possess activity for the selective hydrogenation of adipic acid. However, the supporting materials do result in distinctive catalytic performances for the hydrogenation process, even if the bimetallic particle sizes are similar (except the Ir1Re1/SBA-15). It is inferred that the surface property especially the surface acidity of different supporting materials may also influence the adsorption/activation of H2 and reactants [45], which further facilitates or restrains the catalytic activity. Under such consideration, the NH3-TPD results are conducted to reveal the surface acid sites as shown in Fig. 3 . Several overlapped peaks appear by different catalysts. The desorption peak at lower temperature of 50-300 °C is related to NH3 adsorbed on the surface weak acid sites. The peaks in the range of 300-500 °C should be assigned to the medium strong acid sites [46,47]. The desorption peaks at 500-700 °C in Ir1Re1/SBA-15 and Ir1Re1/Al2O3 are resulted from the strong acid sites due to the acidic surface of the support. There are also obvious desorption peaks in the carbon supported bimetallic catalysts at 700 °C and even higher temperature, which should be ascribed to the carbon reduced by NH3. In fact, only the Ir1Re1/Al2O3, Ir1Re1/AC, and Ir1Re1/AC-p samples have the desorption peaks related to the weak acid sites at 100-200 °C. Whilst no obvious consumption peaks of weak or medium strong acid sites can be observed in the Ir1Re1/SBA-15 and Ir1Re1/CNT samples. The catalytic performances to hydrogenate adipic acid by Ir1Re1 catalysts supported on different materials were investigated (Fig. 4 ), including the carbon materials (activated carbon and CNT), alumina and silica (SBA-15). Ir-Re bimetallic composition supported on SBA-15 displays poor activity with only 23% conversion of adipic acid. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol and n-hexanol is less than 10% with most reactants converted into gaseous products and macromolecular deposits. Ir1Re1/AC and Ir1Re1/AC-p samples supported on carbon materials display better performances. However, the Ir1Re1/CNT supported on carbon nanotubes performs unsatisfied performance with only 40% conversion of adipic acid and 35% selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol. The adipic acid conversion and 1,6-hexanediol selectivity by Ir1Re1/Al2O3 reach 99% and 49%, respectively. It is remarkable that the surface acidity of supported Ir1Re1 catalysts seems to be relevant with the catalytic performances. The Ir1Re1/AC and Ir1Re1/Al2O3 samples with abundant acid sites deserve the better activity and yield of 1,6-hexanediol. Pretreated activated carbon supported Ir1Re1/AC displays the better catalytic performance than other samples, the yield of 1,6-hexanediol reaches 59% with the complete conversion of adipic acid. The Ir-Re bimetallic catalyst supported on pretreated activated carbon displays appropriate surface chemistry with better catalytic performance. Herein, pretreated activated carbon is used as typical support to understand the role of Ir/Re atomic ratio in promoting the chemical and surface properties as well as the catalytic behavior. Surface and chemical properties of IrxRey/AC Ir-Re based catalysts with different Ir/Re atomic ratios have been synthesized and the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 5 . Different from the Ir-Re catalysts supported on other materials, an additional diffraction peak at 26.2° appears, which is attributed to the metal species in oxidation states. Unique interaction between Ir-Re is possibly induced on the pre-functionalized activated carbon. And distinctive surface compositions and metal distribution are able to be generated in these samples. The morphology of the Ir1Re1/AC sample is observed by HAADF-STEM EDS elemental mappings. Small and highly dispersed metal particles can be revealed as the shining spots in the STEM images (Fig. 6 ). It is clearly seen that both the Re and Ir elements are uniformly distributed on the surface of activated carbon. There is no aggregation or sintering of particles observed from the elemental mappings. The TEM images of monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples are displayed in Fig. 7 for comparison. The average particle sizes of Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples are 2.6 and 1.8 nm, respectively. It is suggested that both fine particles of Ir and Re species on the surface can be easily formed and anchored on the surface of carbon. Compared to the Re3/AC catalyst, Ir-containing particles with narrower size distribution are generated. No matter how, the bimetallic particles are becoming even uniformly distributed on the surface with slightly increased sizes compared to the monometallic particles, mainly due to the complexity of contact interface and interaction between the bimetallic compositions. The XPS spectra in the Re4f and Ir4f regions are displayed in Fig. 8 . Two broad peaks can be observed in the Re4f region and deconvoluted into several overlapped peaks. Two pairs of peaks related to Re4f7/2 and 4f5/2 are locating at 40.5 and 45.2 eV, which should be corresponding to the presence of surface Re° and Re6+ species. In the 3 wt% monometallic Re3/AC sample, Re6+ as the major component (93%) are detected with only few Re° species (7%). After small amount of Ir decoration, the Re4+ species (13%) at binding energy of 42.6 eV appears in the Ir1Re2/AC sample, suggesting the formation of novel metal sites in the bimetallic particles. The total percentage of reduced Re species (Re4+ and Re°) is 25% in the Ir1Re2/AC sample. As the Ir content further raises, the Re6+ species on the surface become 84% and 86% in Ir1Re1/AC and Ir2Re1/AC samples, respectively. It is interesting that appropriate Ir decoration leads to the formation of more reduced Re species. It is also worth to note the binding energy of Re6+ species slightly shifts to higher B.E. with the additional Ir species. Meanwhile, two pairs of peaks can be observed in the Ir4f XPS spectra of Ir3/AC, which should be resulted from the Ir4+ (61.5 and 64.5 eV) and Ir5+ (62.2 and 65.2 eV) species [48,49]. 78% of Ir4+ species is present in the monometallic Ir/AC sample. After the co-decoration of small amount of Re species in Ir2Re1/AC, the surface percentage of Ir4+ species greatly decreases to 44%, whilst the metallic Ir° species generates with the appearance of binding energy at 60.9 eV and accounts for 32% of the surface Ir species [50]. Further increase of the Re amount causes the decrease of the reduced Ir species. It is suggested that the formation of metal species obviously depends on the atomic ratio between Ir and Re. New species generated on the surface in the Ir-Re catalysts. Considering the formation of reduced Re species and Ir5+ species in the bimetallic samples, it is inferred that specific interaction between Re and Ir is constructed. Electrons are likely to be transformed from Ir atoms to the Re atoms. The synergistic interaction between Re and Ir may also adjust the morphology of bimetallic particles, causing the rearrangement of different compositions, as revealed by the much uniform particles distributed on the surface in bimetallic samples. In order to understand the reducibility of precursor and the redox properties of the active sites in different catalysts, H2-TPR has been operated and the results are shown in Fig. 9 a. Broad reduction peaks exist in the range of 100-400 °C and 500-750 °C. The peaks at higher temperature are resulted from the methanation of carbon in the presence of H2 [51]. In the monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples, huge desorption peaks are observed with the maximum at 280 °C and 350 °C, respectively, which should be mainly resulted from the hydrogen overflow usually happened on the surface of precious metal, and was reported to be efficient for the hydrogen evolution reaction [52]. However, in the current hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogen overflow of monometallic catalyst may largely impair their ability to adsorb and dissociate H2 molecules, resulting in the restrained hydrogenation ability of catalysts. In the Ir-Re bimetallic catalysts, there is no intensive reduction peaks observed before 400 °C. Only small and broad reduction peak at about 100 °C appears in the Ir1Re1/AC sample and should be related to the reduction of surface metal species in oxidation states. The remarkable hydrogen spillover effect can be efficiently restrained in the bimetallic Ir-Re samples. It has also to be noted that very few amount of H2 consumption in the Ir1Re2/AC and Ir2Re1/AC is detected in the range of 100-400 °C, although XPS spectra suggested the existence of surface metal species in oxidation states. The intensive interaction between Ir and Re may also hinder the co-reduction of the bimetallic compositions. Fig. 9b is the H2-TPD profiles of different samples. Observable desorption peaks are locating at 90 °C and 105 °C of Re3/AC and Ir3/AC, respectively. It can be ascribed to the adsorbed H2 molecules by surface precious metal species. Only slight variation of peak maximum to the higher temperature can be found with the raising ratio of additional Ir species. Catalytic performances of IrxRey/AC The catalytic performances to hydrogenate adipic acid by a series of IrxRey/AC catalysts have been displayed in Fig. 10 . The monometallic Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples also possess the catalytic performances. The conversions of adipic acid by Ir3/AC and Re3/AC are only 35% and 19%, respectively. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol is as low as 2% and 10% by the Ir3/AC and Re3/AC samples. It is suggested that monometallic samples did not have enough catalytic activity to activate or dissociate of the reactant. Whilst after the addition of secondary metal composition, the Ir-Re/AC samples display much enhanced activity of both the conversion of adipic acid and the yield of 1,6-hexanediol. The atomic ratio between Ir and Re significantly influences the catalytic performance. Compared to the Ir1Re2/AC and Ir2Re1/AC, the Ir1Re1/AC has better performance. The conversion reaches 77% with 52% selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol. No matter how, challenges still exist considering the harsh conditions such as high pressure and the strict acid atmosphere of the catalyst during the reaction. Herein, cycle reactions have been investigated using Ir1Re1/AC as shown in Fig. 10b. After four times of reaction, although the conversion of adipic acid decreases from 77% to 66%, only 4% loss of 1,6-hexanediol selectivity can be observed. The possible roles of Ir-Re during hydrogenation Based on the characterization and experimental results, bimetallic Ir-Re particles supported on pre-treated AC deserve better catalytic performances. In fact, both the Ir and Re species could act as the active sites for the current hydrogenation process, although their activity is relatively mean. In a typical bimetallic sample, rhenium species in oxidation states with electron-deficient surface are easily acting as the acid sites to adsorb/activate the C = O bond in the adipic acid [53]. NH3-TPD also suggested the positive correlation between the catalytic performances of Ir1Re1 samples and the number of weak acid sites. H2 molecules are ready to be adsorbed, activated and dissociated on the surface of reduced metal species [13,53]. However, the functional roles of Ir and Re species in the bimetallic particles are more than physical collaboration. Different from the monometallic samples, H2-spillover is restrained evidently in the IrxRey bimetallic samples. Whilst the activation and adsorption ability of H2 are only slightly influenced in the bimetallic Ir-Re samples compared with the monometallic samples. It is also consistent with the previous suggestion that the activation ability of H2 were barely influenced after ReOx addition [53]. The heterolytic dissociation of H2 to hydride and protons stimulated by the ReOx was confirmed more predominant in the bimetallic Ir-ReOx samples. The surface structure and chemical compositions of the bimetallic particles have been greatly modified compared to the monometallic samples. In the bimetallic sample such as Ir1Re1/AC, the particles are more uniformly distributed on the surface with slightly larger sizes around 4 nm. It is believed that the metal elements in the bimetallic samples may go through re-arrangement due to the co-existence of Ir and Re species. Surface information detected by XPS spectra confirms the generation of bimetallic synergy. The chemical compositions change along with the Ir/Re atomic ratio, and electrons are delivered between the Ir and Re species. Specific Ir-Re bimetallic particles with Ir/Re ratio of 1:1 facilitates the hydrogenation process most obviously due to its appropriate surface and chemical properties, as well as the synergistic collaboration of metal species. Conclusion In this work, a series of Ir-Re/M catalysts were prepared and used for the hydrogenation of adipic acid in aqueous solution. Both the influences of supporting materials and the atomic ratio between Ir/Re have been investigated. Using carbon materials or alumina as support, the bimetallic samples displayed appropriate acid sites and finely distributed particles, displaying the relatively better catalytic activity and yield towards 1,6-hexandiol. Appropriate atomic ratio of Ir/Re affected the surface metal composition and facilitate the electron delivery between metals. The H2-spillover effect could also be restrained in the bimetallic sample. The Ir1Re1/AC with 3 wt% metal supported on modified activated carbon displayed the better performance. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol was 59% with complete conversion of adipic acid at 180 °C in 10 MPa H2 within 16 h.

        "dc:description": "A series of supported Ir-Re catalysts have been synthesized and used for the hydrogenation of adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol. The influences of supporting materials and the Ir/Re atomic ratio on the catalytic performances have been studied. Results suggested that Ir-Re supported on carbon materials and alumina had appropriate acid sites and better activity for the hydrogenation of adipic acid. Compared to the monometallic catalysts, synergistic interaction was generated and electrons were delivered from Ir to Re. The uniform distribution of metal particles in the Ir-Re catalysts and the well restrained H2-spillover effect facilitated the transformation of adipic acid and the selective production of 1,6-hexanediol. The selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol was 59% with complete conversion of adipic acid at 180 °C in 10 MPa H2 after reaction for 16 h. After four times of reaction, the selectivity of 1,6-hexanediol only decreased about 4%.",
