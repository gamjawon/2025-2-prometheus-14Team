Their catalytic performance was compared with that of the catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method. The size distribution of the palladium particles prepared by the microemulsion method was remarkably narrow, and the average particle size was much smaller than that prepared by the impregnation method. The catalysts prepared by the microemulsion method were found to exhibit a much higher activity for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide than the catalysts prepared by impregnation. Keywords: CO hydrogenation; Noble metal catalyst; Microemulsion 1. Introduction The metal particle size of supported catalysts is an important factor affecting catalytic reactions. The catalytic behavior of small particles for structure-sensitive reactions has become of interest [1-3]. However, there has been no method of controlling the metal particle size of supported catalysts regardless of metal content. Accordingly, we started to develop a novel method of controlling the metal particle size using microemulsion. We reported that the Rh particle size could be controlled using water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsion, and that the silica- * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, the palladium catalysts supported on zirconia were investigated from the viewpoints of controlling palladium particle size using w/o microemul- sion and enhancing the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of carbon mon- oxide. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The system of polyoxyethylene(5)glycol-p-nonylphenyl ether (NP-5)/cyclohex- ane/aqueous palladium chloride solution was employed as a w/o microemulsion. Palladium chloride was dissolved in aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of which the concentration was twice as high as was the palladium concentration. The concentration of palladium chloride, which will be denoted by [Pd]w hereafter, was 0.1~2.0 mol/1. The w/o microemulsions were prepared by injecting an aqueous palladium chloride solution into the surfactant solution in cyclohexane. Palladium metal microparticles were prepared by adding hydrazine monohydrate directly to the microemulsion solution at 25. The amount of hydrazine monohydrate was about three times as much as that of palladium chloride. After water was added to the microemulsion solution, the hydrolysis was carried out at a pH in the range of 1.5-2.0 for 1 h with vigorous stirring, and then zirconia precipitate involving the palladium nanoparticles was obtained. A water-to-zirconium tetrabutoxide molar ratio was about 22 during hydrolysis. The precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifugation and were washed three times by ethanol. The amount of palladium in the supernatant liquid was found to be less than 0.1% of the initial amount of palladium by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICR Nippon Jahrrell-Ash ICP-575II). Accordingly, almost all the initial palladium was regarded as supported on zirconia. The precipitate obtained was dried at 80 overnight, and were calcined in air at 350 for 2 h, and finally reduced in hydrogen stream at 350 for 2 h. The catalyst prepared by this method will be denoted by [ME]. The catalyst denoted by [IMP] was prepared by impregnating zirconia with an aqueous palladium chloride solution and by reducing in hydrogen stream at 350 for 2 h. Zirconia was obtained by calcination of zirconium hydroxide precipitated from an aqueous zirconyl nitrate solution. 2.2. Reaction procedure All the catalysts were sized to 16-28 mesh and pre-reduced before being subjected to reaction. The hydrogenation reaction was done with a fixed-bed flow W.-Y Kim et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 283-289 285 reactor under a pressure of 4.0 MPa of syngas (CO : H2 : Ar=3 : 6 : 1). The effluent gas was directly led to gas chromatographs for analysis. The values of CO conversion and product selectivities at a time on stream of 6 h were employed in this work unless otherwise mentioned. The palladium particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shi- madzu ADG-302) and transmission electron micrography (TEM, Nihon Denshi JEM-2000FX). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Effect of supports The results of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide over palladium catalysts supported on zirconia, titania and alumina, which were prepared both by the microemulsion method and by the impregnation method, are shown in Fig. 1. The product selectivities were not significantly different between [ME] and [IMP] catalysts, while the activity of the [ME] catalysts was much higher than that of the [IMP] catalysts. The methanol yield was the highest with the zirconia-supported catalyst prepared by the microemulsion method. Thus we investigated this zirconia-supported palladium catalyst more carefully.

Control of palladium particle size The size of the palladium particles formed in w/o microemulsions will be controlled by changing micelle size, molar ratio of hydrazine to palladium chloride and concentration of palladium chloride in water-pools [6]. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the initial concentration of palladium chloride in water-pools and the palladium particle size supported on zirconia. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the palladium particle size of the Pd/ZrO2 catalyst (Pd content, 5.0 wt%; molar ratio of water to surfactant, 4.4) upon the initial concentration of palladium chloride in water-pools. The palladium particle sizes shown in Fig. 2 were measured by TEM. The palladium particle size was dependent on the concentration of palladium salts and became the smallest at the palladium concentration of 1.0 mol/1. Fig. 3 shows the average diameters and the size histograms of the palladium particles of the [ME] and [IMP] catalysts. The size distribution of the palladium particles of the [ME] catalyst was remarkably narrow, and the average particle size was much smaller than that of the [IMP] catalyst. The XRD patterns of the zirconia-supported catalysts prepared from microemulsion and from impregnation are shown in Fig. 4.

Kim et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 283-289 [IMP] catalyst showed a sharp peak at 40.2corresponding to palladium (1 1 1), and the particle sizes of these catalysts were calculated to be about 8, 12 and 12 nm, respectively, according to the broadening technique. These values were in fairly good agreement with those measured by TEM. On the other hand, the [ME] catalysts prepared from palladium concentrations of 0.56 and 1.0 mol/l had no peak, which suggests that the palladium particle size was very small. Judging from these results, we can conclude that the palladium particle size could be controlled by the concentration of palladium salts in the water-pools regardless of palladium content. 20 I I I I o~15 t- O ,m t- O 0 0 5 o 0 [IMP] ~ O I I I I 0 3 6 9 12 15 Average Pd particle size [nm] 100 o~' 75 :_s 5O co 25 2.5 3 4 7 12 12 [ME] [IMP] MeOH* [] C2+ H.C.

Effect of palladium particle size on catalytic performance The catalytic behavior of Pd/ZrO2 [ME] catalyst, whose palladium particle size was controlled, for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is shown in Fig. 5. The difference in the product selectivities were not so great, and thus the product selectivities were considered to be independent of the palladium particle size. However, the CO conversion increased with a decrease in the palladium particle size. The catalyst with an average particle size of 2.5 nm exhibited the highest activity. The activity of this catalyst represented by CO conversion was about three times as high as that of the [IMP] catalyst. 4. Conclusions It was found that the palladium particle size of the catalyst prepared by the microemulsion method could be controlled by the concentration of palladium salts in water-pools and that the activity of the catalyst was dependent on the palladium particle size. The catalyst with an average size of 2.5 nm exhibited the highest activity for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, and the activity of this catalyst was about three times as high as that of the impregnated catalyst.
