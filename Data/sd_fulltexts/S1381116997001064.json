Bamwenda * , Akira Obuchi, Atsushi Ogata, Junko Oi, Satoshi Kushiyama, Koichi Mizuno National Institute for Resources and Environment, 16-3 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305, Japan Received 13 December 1996; revised 28 April 1997; accepted 15 May 1997 Abstract The role of the metal during the reduction of NOZ by propylene in oxygen over alumina and silica-supported gold, rhodium and platinum was studied. It was found that three parallel reactions take place, i.e., reduction of NOz to NZ and N20, reduction of NOZ to NO, and oxidation of propylene. It was also found that in the case of rhodium and platinum catalysts, the reaction may proceed entirely on metallic sites and that the alumina and silica supports do not play a critical role in determining the catalytic activity for NOZ reduction. For gold catalysts, the reaction seems to involve a combination of metal and support catalyzed processes. It was noted that the selectivity toward NZ formation seems to be primarily influenced by the nature of the metal. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The reduction of NO., to NZ is a subject of great interest, from both theoretical and practical aspects, as attempts are being made to get more insight into the nature of the active sites and to find catalysts and reaction conditions which would maximize the catalytic activity for the reduction of nitrogen oxides. In the literature, the role played by different constituents of the catalysts in the reaction mechanism of NO, reduction is still not clear because it seems to vary depending on the type of the reactant and the catalytic systems used. Another complicating factor is that it seems that Corresponding author. Fax: +81-298-588259. 1381-1169/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11 S1381-1169(97)00106-4 different mechanisms may be operable with different catalysts [1-5]. In an attempt to address the fundamental question concerning the role of the metal in the mechanism of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, we studied the reduction of NOZ over alumina and silica-supported gold, rhodium, and platinum catalysts so as to gain insight into the possible role of metals during this process. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The gold, rhodium and platinum catalysts were prepared by impregnation of y-A1203 (KHS-24 from Sumitomo Chemical, initially 152 G.R. Bamwen et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 126 (1997) 151-159 calcined in air at 600 for 5 h, area 208 g m-2) and silica (70-230 mesh, Merck) with aqueous solutions of HAuC14 - 4H20, RhC13. 3H ZO and H z PtC16 - 6H ZO, so as to yield 3 wt% metal loading. After impregnation, the slurries were freeze dried overnight at 15 Pa, then calcined in flowing air at 500 for 5 h and finally reduced at 400 under 1 vol% H 2 for 15 h. The resulting powders were sieved to give a 60-100 mesh fraction. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The BET surface areas were determined using NZ physisorption and a Nikkso 4232 analyzer. The dispersion of Pt and Rh were measured after activity tests by adsorption of CO using the pulse adsorption technique and the Ohkura 86015 system. The dispersion of Au particles was not determined due to the lack of an appropriate adsorbate. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of the catalyst samples were obtained with a JOEL JEM-2000EX electron microscope. The metal particle size distributions were obtained from diameter measurements of up to 500 particles per catalyst sample from TEM photographic print enlargements, in a procedure similar to that we have reported previously [6]. The physicochemical properties of alumina supported catalysts are summarized in Table 1.

Catalytic measurements The catalytic experiments were performed in a continuous flow tubular, quartz reactor (8 mm LD.) operated at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (200 mg) was packed into a 7-8 mm long bed between plugs of quartz wool. The feed consisted of the mixtures of ca. 1000 ppm NOZ, 1000 PPM C3H6, and 5% 02, with a He (UHP) balance. The gas flow rates were controlled with mass flow controllers, and the total flow rate was maintained at 160 cm3/min (STP), corresponding to a space velocity of ca. 27 000 h-'. The feed gases was passed downward through the catalyst layer. After activity measurements at a given temperature, by bypassing the catalyst bed a background spectrum was measured to determine initial concentrations of NO, NO + NO2, N20, CO and COz. The equilibrium for the reaction NOZ = NO + 1/202 is such that a small amount of NO and OZ are always present in NOZ at room temperature (Kz9sx=7.23 X 10-7) [7]. Thus in the NOZ feed, NO was initially present as a 0.6-1 % impurity. The temperature was monitored by a thermocouple placed below the catalyst bed. The activity data were acquired at steady state, in an ascending temperature sequence followed by a descending temperature sequence. The obtained data had fairly good reproducibility. 2.4. Analysis Total NO,, (NO + NOZ) in the feed and product streams was analyzed with a chemiluminescent NO., analyzer (Yanagimoto, ECL-77A). The NO concentration was analyzed with a Horiba CLA-S lOSS analyzer. In repeated experiments, the product concentrations of nitrogen oxides were reproducible within %. The N2, OZ and CO in the effluent was sampled and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (Shimadzu, 14A) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), using 40 cm3 min-' He G.R. Bamwen et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 126 (1997) 151-159 as a carrier gas and a 2 m molecular sieve 13X column at 70. The outlet N20 was analyzed both with a Horiba VIA-510 analyzer and by GC (Shimadzu GC-148) equipped with a TCD detector and a 2 m stainless steel column packed with molecular sieves 13 X at 70. Carbon dioxide and CO in the products were analyzed with a non-dispersive infrared spectroscopic gas analyzer (Shimadzu, URA 106). The identification of the minor products was performed using a Hewlett Packard HP5970B GC-MS. The following expressions will be used in the text. The conversion of NOZ is defined as: XNOx= ((N02Ir+ [NO],- [N02]p- [NO] P) /[N02]r X 100 Selectivity to NZ = [Nz]/([NZ] + [NZO]) X 100. Amount of carbon in CA converted to COZ and CO: e.g., COZ = [C021P X 100/3[C3H6]r. where [N021r and [N021p are reactor inlet and exit NO,, concentrations, respectively, and [NZ ] and [NZO] are the exit NZ and NZO concentrations, respectively. 3. Results 3.1. The NOZ = NO + 1 / 202 reaction in the absence of propylene Fig. 1 a shows the activities of the catalysts for NO2 decomposition into NO. Nitrogen and N2O were not detected in the product stream. For Rh and Pt catalysts, the conversion of NOz to NO increased with temperature and quickly attained equilibrium conversion levels at ca. 350 and 400, respectively. At temperatures > 400, the thermodynamic equilibrium strongly favors the partial decomposition of NO2 into NO and oxygen. This reaction was slow on Au and y-A1203, and the conversions were always some distance from equilibrium. For 153 Au/A1203, the temperatures required for the onset of NOz conversion to NO was > 350. Also, pure y-A1203 significantly converted NOZ to NO at temperatures > 400. The same results were obtained in repeated experiments with another batches of y-A1203 and new reactors. When the feed was a mixture of NO and OZ (Fig. lb), the oxidation of NO to NOZ over Rh/A1203 and Pt/A1203 increased progressively with temperature passing over a maximum of 58 and 45% at - 350 before declining to near equilibrium conversions of 44 and 42% at ca. 400, respectively. Only a slight oxidation of NO was observed on Au, peaking at about at 450. The y-A1203 showed only a marginal activity in NO2 formation and it was practically independent of temperature in the tested range. It follows from Fig. 1 that in large excess of oxygen the equilibrium between NO2 and NO is approached rapidly on Rh/A1203 and Pt/A1203 in the temperature range between 350-400, but Au/A1203 moves the reactants to equilibrium at temperatures > 500. The observed differences in the relative effectiveness of the catalysts for the NOZ = NO + 1 /202 and its reverse reaction may possibly be ascribed to kinetic factors e.g., the differences in the dissociative adsorption rates of nitrogen oxides and oxygen, and the differences in the bonding strengths of the species formed on the catalysts surfaces. Finally, the results obtained in Fig. 1 suggest that the NO2 = NO + 1/202 forward and reverse reactions proceed on the same sites. 3.2. The NOZ + C3 H6 + OZ reaction on alumina and silica-supported catalysts The principal products from the NOz + C 3 H 6 + OZ reaction on both alumina and silica-supported catalysts were nitrogen, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and water.

A more detailed analysis of the minor products, and the variation of product distribution with temperature will be published elsewhere [8]. The catalytic effects on the selective reduction of NOZ over alumina (solid lines) and silica (dashed lines)-supported catalysts are summarized in Figs. 2-5.

Note that the maximum NOx conversions are attained at lower temperatures than the temperature of maximum NO oxidation to NO2, and the temperature where NOz decomposition into NO reaches equilibrium (see Fig. 1). The activity curve of the Au catalyst was markedly different from those of Rh and Pt. The NOZ conversion increased steadily with temperature reaching conversions up to 52o at 400 before gradually falling off with temperature [9]. The NOZ conversion over y-A1203 increased steadily with temperature and remained near 100% at temperatures > 400 [10]. It is worth noting that although NOZ conversion curves of y-A1203 and Au/y-A1203 are somewhat similar, y203 is far more effective than the Au/203 catalyst in the investigated temperature range. We will come back to this further in the text. In an empty reactor, not shown, there was practically no measurable NOZ conversion below 500. The selectivity of NZ and the undesirable N20 production from NOZ reduction are presented in Fig. 3. Platinum exhibited a poor selectivity to N2, giving N20 as a predominant product. The Au and Rh catalysts showed a good NZ selectivity, while y-A1203 reached NZ selectivities ca. 90o at temperatures > 350. Overall, y-A1203 and Au/y-A1203 are more selective towards NZ with a lower formation of N20. G.R.

Selectivity of NO= conversion to N2 and NCO. Conditions as in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 depicts the yield of CO and COZ from the conversion of C 3 H 6 during the reduction of NOZ. It is seen that on Au, Rh and Pt catalysts, at temperatures greater than the optimum temperature, the combustion of C3H6 becomes a predominant route. A notable feature here is the simultaneous enhanced evolution of the C 3H 6 oxidation products COZ and CO, and the onset of the NOZ conversion (see Fig. 2). Although y-A1203 was able to convert NOZ to NZ it gave mainly CO in the process. A careful examination of Figs. 2 and 4 reveals that the low N02 conversion over Au/203 in comparison with bare A1203 can be attributed to the fact that at a substantial amount of propylene is burned over Au/203 before it can selectively reduce NO, and this leads to the suppression of its activity. 100 c --L--A[203 . . ---n_ 3%Au/A1203 --0-3% hIA1203 2 --O-3%~PIt/A1203 .

At low temperatures, a high conversion of NOZ to NO, above equilibrium NOZ - NO + 1 /202 conversion, was noted on Au, Rh and Pt catalysts. With increase in reaction temperature, the NO composition eventually approached the equilibrium between 350400 on alumina-supported catalysts and, at ca. 400 over silica-supported catalysts. On Au/203, the NO yield fell below equilibrium concentrations at temperatures greater than the temperature of maximum NOZ conversion (see Fig. 2). Over pure A1203, the NO yield was far below equilibrium and it remained more or less constant before declining at temperatures 350.

It is evident from Figs. 2-5 that the temperature-dependent behavior, the percentage conversions of NOZ reduction to NZ for alumina- and silica-supported Rh and Pt catalysts are qualitatively quite similar; the most notable differences are that the measurable conversion set in at lower temperatures on alumina-supported catalysts than on silica-supported catalysts, and the disparity in the selectivity toward NZ formation; Rh catalysts exhibiting higher NZ yields. Thus, Table 2 Catalytic activities and products from the NO + C3H6 + Oz reaction it appears that alumina and silica has little, if any, direct effect on the NOZ reduction process over these catalysts. Surprisingly, only a minute activity was observed over Au/S'02 and none on bare Si02 at temperatures up to 500. 3.3. The NO + C3 H6 + OZ reaction In order to get the full picture on the reduction of nitrogen oxides over these catalysts, we studied the NO + C 3 H 6 + OZ reaction under identical reaction conditions, and the results are summarized in Table 2. In the case of Rh and Pt catalysts, the qualitative comparison between the NO +C3H6+OZ and NOZ+C3H6+OZ systems indicates similar behaviors from the point of view of both products observed and the temperature of maximum activity. For Au/203 and unsupported A1203, the conversion levels were lower than when the feed stream was NOZ + C3H6 + 02, but here the conversion levels of NO on Au/203 was significantly higher than that of bare A1203. This result partially indicates that over bare alumina and Au/203, NOZ plays a certain role in the reduction of NO. The results presented in Fig. 3 and Table 2 also suggest that the selectivity with respect to NZ seems to be primarily influenced by the nature of the metal used.

Discussion The purpose of this study was to obtain information concerning the catalytic reduction of NO2 and to investigate the role played by the metal during the SCR process. From the results presented above, the tested catalysts can be divided into catalysts that are active at low temperatures (Pt/A1203 and Rh/A1203) and those active at relatively high temperatures (A1203, Au/A1203). 4.1. Pure A1203 During the SCR of NO2, y-alumina has exhibited a significant activity towards NOZ reduction to NZ, and NO2 partial decomposition into NO. This may be rationalized in the terms of the following considerations: The surface of y-A1203 possesses both Lewis acid and basic sites which have been confirmed by strong adsorption of basic and acidic molecules [ 11 ]. Propylene can be activated on y-A1203 through the interaction with Lewis acid sites and/or by the concerted action of the basic and acidic sites to form allyl complexes [ 12,13]. The interaction of these adspecies with gas phase or adsorbed NO and NOZ complexes may lead to the formation of active intermediates which may eventually lead to the formation of the observed products. Recently, Sadykov et al. [14] provided experimental evidence that stable nitrates, as M-N03 or M-ONO2, were adsorbed on yA1203 and suggested that the interaction of these strongly bound nitrogen oxides species with activated hydrocarbons provide the selective reduction route observed on y-A1203. 4.2. Pt supported on y-A'203 and S'02 The remarkable feature of the data from platinum catalysts is the great similarity in the NO2 conversion results over Pt supported on alumina and on inactive silica. The peak NOz conver- 157 sion and kinetic behavior of Pt/A1203 are very similar to those of Pt/S'02; it seems that, on Pt-based catalysts, the SCR reaction may proceed predominantly on active centers of platinum crystallites of the catalysts. In other words, the support component contributes little to the SCR of NOZ. The high NO yields observed from the SCR of NO2 at lower temperatures may be ascribed to the fact that, apart from the direct decomposition of NOZ shown in Fig. la, NO is additionally produced from the interaction between adsorbed propylene and N02. Nitrogen dioxide has an unpaired electron. It is known that NOZ radicals can remove hydrogen from saturated hydrocarbons, e.g., during the nitration of CH 4 to form nitromethane via a gas phase NO2 + CH4 reaction [15,16]. Thus, it seems reasonable to speculate that during NOz reduction, NOZ can abstract an allylic hydrogen from propylene to form NO, OH, propenyl and/or allyl radicals, which may eventually take part directly or indirectly in subsequent NOZ reduction reactions. As is evident from Figs. 2 and 4, the NOZ reduction activity over platinum-based catalysts passed through the maximum as the conversion of CA to Cox increased and approached a 100% level. This demonstrates that part of the C3H6 conversion process is initiated by the interaction between NOZ and C3H6 species, as described above. After passing the peak activity, the NOZ reduction activity falls with increasing reaction temperature. The following explanations can be sought for this behavior. At temperatures higher than optimum temperature, the fall in activity of Pt catalysts is related to the decrease in surface coverage by nitrogen oxides or its complexes, i.e., nitrites and/or nitrates, and a decrease in organic adspecies due to desorption and/or decomposition. These factors decrease the NOZ reduction rate, as we have observed previously from in situ DRIFT spectroscopy studies [17,18]. Another explanation is the competition for propylene between oxygen (combustion process) and NO,, species. A higher temperature favors the C 3 H 6 combustion. 158 G.R. Bamwenda et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 126 (1997) 151-159 4.3. Rh supported on y-A1203 and Si02 The trend and performance of Rh/A1203 were similar to that observed for Rh/SiOz. The N02 SCR reaction profile for rhodium catalysts was much the same to that observed in the case of alumina and silica supported-platinum catalysts. A notable exception is that Rh catalysts displayed a slightly wide activity window with a temperature of maximum NOZ reduction ca. 50 higher than that of Pt catalysts, and they provided a better NZ selectivity in the whole temperature range examined. Similar activity trends were noted in the NO + C 3 H 6 + O Z reaction (not shown). Therefore, the observed catalytic behavior of Rh catalysts can be explained on the similar basis as that discussed above for Pt catalysts. When considering the commercial application of Rh and Pt catalysts, it would be important to minimize the formation of NZO which contributes to both stratospheric ozone destruction and greenhouse warming [19,20]. At the temperature of maximum N02 conversion, the N2/N20 concentration ratio in the exit stream was about 0.3 and 1.6 for Pt and Rh catalysts, respectively. In the NO + CA + OZ reaction, the N2/N20 ratio was 0.6 and 1.6, for Pt and Rh catalysts, respectively (Table 2). Thus, for Rh catalysts, the selectivity to NZ was nearly identical for the N02 + C3H6 + OZ and NO + C3H6 + OZ systems, whereas over Pt catalysts it was slightly better in the NO + C3H6 + OZ system. The better selectivity to NZ observed on Rh catalysts can be attributed to the fact that Rh catalysts have a good activity for NZO decomposition to dinitrogen. When we used the same Pt and Rh catalysts, to investigate the N20 (0.1%) + OZ (5%)/He reaction, the steady-state rates for N20 decomposition were 3.6 and 5.7 X 103 /.tmol(N20) g-' h-' for 3% Pt/A1203 and 3% Rh/A1203 at 300, respectively. At 400, the N20 decomposition rates were 20 and 24.4 X 103 ju,mol g-' h-' for 3% Pt/A1203 and 3% Rh/A1203, respectively. On 3% Rh/A1203, the temperature of 50% (TSo) de- composition of N20 for the N20 + OZ reaction was ca. 400 [21,22]. Thus, the N20 decomposition performance of Pt/A1203 is negligible in comparison to that of Rh/A1203. Therefore, the observed differences in the N2/N20 ratio between Pt and Rh catalysts during the SCR of NOz may be interpreted on the basis of the fact that Rh exhibits a significantly higher activity for the decomposition of N20 to N2 than Pt catalysts. Work is underway in our laboratory to develop catalysts for NZO decomposition after a NO., reduction stage. Preliminary results show that hydrotalcit derived catalysts, e.g., ZnAlRh-HTIc (0.8 wt% Rh) with a T5o = 350, are prospective candidates for practical application even in the presence of water [22]. With such a catalyst, the overall conversion of NO,, to N2 can be improved and catalytic efficiencies of industrial relevance can be obtained. 4.4. Au supported on y-A'203 and Si02 The impregnation of gold on alumina slightly enhanced the activity for oxidation of NO to NOZ (Fig. lb), and led to the formation of a relatively large amount of NO during the SCR of NO2 than that noted over bare alumina (Fig. 5). Over Au/S'021 mainly a non-selective interaction between C3H6 and N02 leading to the formation of NO and OZ was noted; only a negligible NOz reduction activity to NZ was observed. The fact that the activity of Au/A1203 towards NOZ reduction was lower than that observed over bare A1203 implies that gold on the alumina masks some of the sites on the alumina and makes them inactive for reduction of NO2. On the other hand, Au/A1203 displayed a better activity in the NO + C3 H6 + OZ reaction. In this case, it appears reasonable to assume that, the reaction may involve a combination of metal and support catalyzed processes, where Au assists A1203 in the formation of N02, which is then mostly reduced to N2 and small amounts of N20 on active sites of A1203. It may be added here that, the fact that the SCR G.R. Bamwenda et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 126 (1997) 151-159 of NO2 proceeds at such reasonable rate in spite of much of the NO2 being converted to NO suggests that the propagation of the NO, reduction may take place via an interaction between activated C3H6 species and either NO or NO2. 5. Summary The Rh and Pt catalysts showed a relatively high NOZ reduction activity in the 250-300 temperature range but with a narrow temperature window over which the catalysts are effective. Gold and alumina showed a low activity towards NOZ decomposition in the absence of propylene, moderate SCR activities at high temperatures with a broad temperature window, and a remarkably high NO2 conversion selectivity to NZ as compared with N20. The kinetic behavior and performances of Rh/A1203 and Pt/A1203 are very similar to that of Rh/S'02 and Pt/S'02 indicating that, in the case of Rh and Pt catalysts, the supports A1203 and Si02, contribute little to the catalytic activity for NO2 reduction. The important factor appears to be the reaction dynamics between competing reactions, e.g., between the reduction of NOZ to N2 and N20, NO2 partial decomposition to NO and, combustion of propylene on the surfaces of rhodium and platinum or their oxides. In the case of gold catalysts, the reaction may involve a combination of metal and support catalyzed processes. Since the both NOZ + C3H6 + OZ and NO + C3H6 + OZ reactions proceed at comparable rates over Rh and Pt, this suggests that the oxidation of NO to NOZ is not a prerequisite for the SCR reaction to proceed over Pt and Rh metals. Such an initial NO pre-oxidation step seems to be necessary on catalysts like alumina or alumina-supported gold. Finally, the present results also suggest that the selectivity with respect to NZ seems to be 159 primarily influenced by the nature of the metal used. References [ 1 ] M. Iwamoto, Catal.
