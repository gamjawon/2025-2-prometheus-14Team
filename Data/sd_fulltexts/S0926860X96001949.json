Reduction of the catalyst at or above 973 K caused severe recrystallization of CeO2 and Pd with simultaneous strong interaction between the two components appearing as three phenomena: epitaxial growth of small Pd particles on CeO2 (most frequently with [lll]Pdll[lll]CeO2); decoration of large Pd particles with ordered CeO2 overlayer and expansion of the lattice parameter of Pd (by 2.1%). The origin of the Pd lattice expansion is discussed and diffusion of Ce species into the Pd lattice seems to be the most probable one. HTR caused also phase transformations in the ceria support. At 973 K and 1100 K, whole CeO2 was transformed into oxygen deficient CeOx phase exhibiting the same or similar structure but with expanded lattice parameter (by 2.8%). At 1180 K most ceria was transformed into hexagonal A-Ce203. The CeO~ phase appeared to be stable in hydrogen and in vacuum at room temperature, but upon exposure to air at room temperature it rapidly reoxidised to CeO2. Ce203 also reoxidised to CeO2 but much slower. Another consequence of HTR at or above 773 K was formation of pits in CeO2 crystallites, mainly on (112)-type crystal faces. The pits (1-10 nm) exhibited well defined walls parallel to CeO2 lattice fringes and they could possibly constitute nucleation sites for strongly bonded, epitaxial oriented Pd particles.

Wotcyrz /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 application in automotive pollution control (three-way catalysts -- TWC) and in syngas conversion. High temperature reduction (HTR) of such catalysts in hydrogen (T>~ 773 K) induces enhanced interaction between metal and ceria modifying drastically the catalytic activity [1-10]. Several models were pro- posed to account for this phenomenon but conclusive explanation is still lacking. The most common interpretation assuming migration of partly reduced ceria onto the surface of metal particles has been proposed [4,8] based on chemisorp- tion and catalytic measurements. Extended high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies summarised in a very recent review by Bernal et al. [11], showed that decoration of metal particles by partly reduced ceria does not occur in Rh/CeO2 [11,12] and Pt/CeO2 [13,14] catalysts reduced in hydrogen up to 773 K. Recently, decoration effects have been observed in Pd/CeO2 [15] and Rh/CeO2 [11] reduced in hydrogen at 873 K and 973 K, respectively. Alternatively, special epitaxial orientation of metal particles on crystalline ceria support, observed by HRTEM and microdiffraction methods for Rh [11,12,16], Pt [13,14] and Au [13] at 773 K is considered as possible cause of the SMSI effect. Finally, formation of intermetallic alloys or compounds of Me-Ce type reported for Pt [17] and Pd [15] at 1173 K and 873 K, respectively, should be taken into account. In a previous paper [15] we have shown that chloride from the metal precursor drastically modifies the microstructure of Pd/ceria catalyst upon HTR, due to the formation of stable cerium oxychloride (CeOC1), and stabilisa- tion of an oxygen deficient CeOx phase. In this work we report on extensive studies on microstructure characterisation (HRTEM, ED and XRD) of Pd/CeO2 catalyst prepared from a chloride free precursor -- Pd nitrate. We expanded also the range of reduction temperatures up to 1180 K to cover the conditions occurring in working TWC catalysts. The results may be of interest in view of recent attempts to use single metal Pd/ceria/alumina catalysts as TWC for automotive pollution control [ 18]. 2. Experimental The Pd/CeO2 catalyst studied in this work contained 9% Pd by weight. It was prepared by mixing suitable amounts of Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution and 20 wt.-% colloidal dispersion of CeO2 in diluted acetic acid (Aldrich). The mixture was evaporated to nearly dry and then heated in an oven at 360 K overnight. Finally, the catalyst was ground in a mortar and stored for further use. Pd loading in the sample as prepared was determined by atomic absorption spec- troscopy (AAS), while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (EDAX 9800 spectrometer with UTV detector) revealed no detectable impurities (Fig. 1). A 10% Pd-CeO2 physical mixture used as control sample was prepared by mixing L. Kepihski, M.

Following reduction samples were cooled to room temperature in hydrogen flow and then after exposure to air were investigated by XRD and HRTEM. In some cases samples were treated in a different way, i.e., after HTR, hydrogen was pumped off and the sample was cooled in vacuum at ca. 5 • 10-3 Pa. XRD spectra were collected with an STOE powder diffractome- ter in the transmission mode with a monochromatic beam (Cu KoL1 radiation) equipped with a position sensitive detector. A small amount of corundum powder was added to each sample as internal standard to allow for precise determination of peak positions and widths. HRTEM and electron diffraction studies were performed with a Philips CM20 microscope equipped with the SuperTwin objective lens (Cs = 1.2 mm) and operated at 200 kV. Specimens for TEM were prepared simply by dipping a copper microscope grid covered with holey carbon film in the freshly reduced sample. The grid was immediately inserted into the microscope.

The spectrum of the catalyst reduced at 973 K and cooled in vacuum was very similar to that in Fig. 2d and is not shown here. As a reference, the spectrum of the untreated Pd black is included in Fig. 3d. The spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 were acquired after ca. 1 h exposure to air, when reoxidation of the unstable oxygen deficient CeOx phase, which forms during prolonged reduction above 873 K, has been completed with, however, no measurable changes in the peaks of the metal phase [15] (cf. also Fig. 4). Only reflections from CeO2 (•) (cubic, a = 0.542 nm) and two different phases of palladium: 'normal' Pd (•) (fcc, a --- 0.389 nm) and 'expanded' Pd (described as Pd*) ([]) (fcc, a = 0.397 nm) occurred in the spectra.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of exposure to air at room temperature on XRD spectrum of Pd/ceria sample reduced at the highest temperature (1180 K) for 45 h and then cooled in vacuum. It is seen that unstable CeOx (zx) (pseudo-cubic, a = 0.556 nm) transforms into 'normal' CeO2 (•) during 1 h exposure to air. Moreover, in addition to 2 forms of cubic ceria and the modified Pd strong reflections from a new phase (*) are present. The phase appeared to be hexagonal A-C%O3 (a = 0.390 nm, c = 0.605 nm, cf. JCPDS Diffraction File no. 23-1048). Numerical results obtained from Fig. 4 describing the time evolution of the sample are shown in Table 2. It appears from XRD results presented above that increasing temperature of reduction caused recrystallization of the support and the metal and, at tempera- 204 L. Kcpifiski, M. Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 tures above 773 K, also their transformation into new phases. New metal phase Pd* is characterised by well defined reflections corresponding to the Pd structure but with the lattice parameter expanded by 2.1%. The lattice parameter of Pd* (0.397 nm) seemed to be independent of the reduction temperature, but the mean crystallite size of Pd* increased steeply at 973 K and 1180 K. It is important that this phase was formed in the Pd/ceria catalyst and in the Fig. 5. Electron micrographs of 9% Pd/CeO2 samples from Fig. 2. Note different magnification for (c) and (d). L.

Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 observed after 5 days (Table 2). For ceria support two phase transformations occurred. First, at 973 K, CeO2 transformed into oxygen deficient CeOx and then at 1180 K into hexagonal A-Ce203. CeOx reoxidised rapidly upon expo- sure to air to nearly stoichiometric CeO2 (a = 0.542 nm, close to a standard value 0.541 nm -- JCPDS no. 34-394). Hexagonal Ce203 was rather stable for short times (several hours) but after several days it evidently underwent reoxida- tion to the 'normal' CeO2 (after 5 days intensity of CeO2 111 reflection increased 2.7 times, while intensity of Ce203 decreased 1.5 times) (Table 2). 3.2. TEM In Fig. 5 electron micrographs showing general appearance of Pd/CeO2 reduced at various temperatures are presented (note the change of magnification for (c) and (d)). It is evident from Fig. 5 that some sintering took place at 573 K and 773 K but severe recrystallization of the support occurred at 973 K.

In each case crystallites exhibit sharp, clean edges and clearly resolved lattice fringes, however, in samples (c) and (d) crystallites have also well developed faces, mainly low index (111), (110) and (100) crystal planes. Due to high contrast generated by CeO2 support Pd particles cannot be easily discriminated in micrographs. As we see later, these particles can, however, be visualised in high resolution micrographs. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns obtained from the samples presented in Fig. 5 (not shown) were consistent with XRD spectra. Only strong rings from CeO2 (cubic) and weak, spotty ones from Pd were seen.

HRTEM Fig. 9 shows HRTEM micrographs of Pd/CeO2 reduced at 973 K. In the centre of Fig. 9a large (35 nm) CeO2 crystal exhibiting (111) lattice fringes (0.31 nm) is seen. The two adjacent external faces of the crystal form an angle 58° and can therefore be identified as (111) and (311) crystal planes. The crystal is thus oriented with its [112,] axis parallel to the electron beam. On the surface of the crystal there are three small crystallites of 8, 4 and 1.7 nm. The crystallites exhibit well developed faces and their edges are parallel to the edges of the CeO2 crystal. Moir6 fringes seen on the crystallites are parallel to CeO2 (111) planes and have an average spacing of 0.84 nm. The average value is given since due to relative broadness of the fringes measurements on even one particle gave results ranging from 0.81 nm to 0.87 nm. These Moir6 fringes must be formed by double diffraction on two sets of parallel lattice planes CeO2 (111) (d = 0.31 nm) and a second one with d = 0.229 + 0.003 nm, stacked on top of the other. The latter value fits very well the (111) interplanar distance of Pd* phase measured by XRD and SAED.

The Moir6 fringes are parallel to CeO2 (200) planes so we may assume that they originate from superposition of CeO2 (200) (0.271 nm) and another parallel lattice fringes with spacing 0.198 nm. This value corresponds well with (200) spacing of Pd *. The Moir6 fringes on Pd Fig. 15. Superstructure fringes on [011] oriented Pd crystallite.

Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 150 (1997) 197-220 crystallites are always straight and parallel to each other indicating that the particles are single crystals free from extensive defects (dislocations, grain boundaries etc.). In addition to Pd crystallites in epitaxial orientation, another contrast features (brighter areas) are seen on CeO2 crystals in Fig. 9b. Such features which we call 'pits' occurred already in micrographs of the sample reduced at 773 K, but at 973 K their number greatly increased. Fig. 10 shows a through-focus series (A f= 60 nm) of CeO2 crystal with a group of pits with sizes from 1 to 6 nm. Contrast of the pits changes from brighter to darker than surrounding when going from underfocus to overfocus. An optimum visibility of pits is in underfocus conditions. The pits exhibit sharp edges, very often parallel to CeO2 (111) lattice fringes. An interesting situation is seen in Fig. 11, where in the centre of the CeO2 crystal in addition to number of pits, two Pd crystallites exhibiting Moir~ fringes are present. It is seen that sizes and shapes of Pd crystallites and pits are very similar. The only difference is the occurrence of the Moir6 fringes in the former. It rises a question whether they are really different objects. Fig. 12 shows a through-focus series (A f= 60 nm) of electron micro- graphs obtained from bare CeO2 support reduced at 973 K for 20 h. The shape of the pits and change of their contrast with focus are like that observed in Pd/CeO2, proving that these features represent changes in the CeO2 support, and not in e.g., metal crystallites. We believe that the pits are formed as the result of a local reduction and removal of ceria. At the highest temperatures (1100 K and 1180 K) further sintering of support and metal was observed with simultaneous (111) faceting of CeO2 crystallites (Fig. 13). The surface of large Pd crystallites was found to be covered with patches of crystalline ceria as it is shown in Fig. 14 for [112] oriented Pd particle. Two different orientations of ceria are present: crystallite b has (111) 1- 1 0 -1, 1 2 3 4 5 nm-1 L O! i I I 1 5 0'.4 0'.3 0.25 0.20 nm Fig. 16.

Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 213 fringes at an angle 60° to Pd (111), while for crystallites a Moir~ fringes indicate parallel orientation. It is worth noting that Pd (111) fringes exhibit spacing 0.228 nm, which agrees well with ED and XRD values and proves that even quite large Pd particles have the expanded crystal lattice. Moreover, it is clear that the lattice expansion and decoration may occur simultaneously. Apart from ceria crystallites other features can be found on the surface of Pd particles in the sample reduced at 1180 K. These features manifest as superstruc- ture fringes (doubled Pd (111) fringes), particularly well visible at overfocus (+40 nm), Fig. 15a. Fig. 15b shows the HRTEM image of the same fragment taken at the Scherzer defocus. An improved visibility of the superstructure at overfocus is the result of special shape of the contrast transfer function (CTF), which exhibit broad maximum (transparency) at 0.46 nm (where weak super- structure fringes occurs) and is close to null below ca. 0.25 nm (where strong primary Pd (111) fringes would be transmitted), Fig. 16, curve 1. At the Scherzer defocus both frequencies are transmitted (though with opposite sign), so that strong, primary (111) fringes dominate the image, Fig. 16, curve 2. Interestingly no reflections corresponding to the superstructure fringes could be seen in the ED pattern. Probably the reason is a superficial character of the superstructure (only surface and subsurface region are involved). 4. Discussion 4.1. Epitaxial orientation in Pd-CeO2 system Results obtained in this work (Fig. 9) clearly show that in Pd/CeO2 samples reduced in hydrogen at 973 K large number of Pd particles with sizes of 1 to 10 nm are epitaxial oriented with respect to CeO2 support. The orientation (Pd (111) lattice planes parallel to CeO2 (111) planes) is characteristic for CeO2 supported metals and has already been observed for Rh [11,12,16], Pt [13,14] and Au [13]. It should be stated, however, that in our case four Pd (111) lattice planes with expanded lattice parameter (4 × 0.229 nm = 0.916 nm) match three CeO2 (111) planes (3 × 0.312 nm= 0.936 nm) with misfit approx. 2%, which is much less than 6% for Rh [12]. It appears, that expansion of Pd lattice reduces the misfit between Pd and CeO2, however, as will be discussed later, the expansion is in our opinion caused also by incorporation of cerium into the Pd lattice (formation of Pd-Ce alloy). 4.2. Expansion of Pd lattice parameter Our SAED and XRD results indicate a 2.1% increase of Pd lattice parameter following reduction at 973 K for 20 h. Higher reduction temperature (up to 1180 K) or longer reduction time (45 h) did not result in further increase of the lattice 214 L. Kcp#iski, M. Wolcyrz /Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 expansion (cf. Tables 1 and 2). It may be understood if we assume that the lattice expansion is caused by Pd-Ce alloying. Then, 2.1% expansion corre- sponds roughly to the solubility limit of Ce in Pd [19,20]. The next phase in the Pd-Ce phase diagram close to Pd-Ce solid solution is a superstructure fcc phase PdvCe with roughly doubled Pd lattice parameter (0.795-0.812 nm) (high temperature modification) [20]. In fact our HRTEM results (Fig. 16) may indicate that such ordered phase forms at the surface of Pd particles. It appears also (Tables 1 and 2) that the 'expanded' Pd forms well distinguishable, single phase with average particle size of ca. 30 nm at 973 K and 1100 K, which suddenly increases to 55 nm at 1180 K. There is an interesting correlation between sudden growth of Pd average particle size and simultaneous structure transformation and recrystallization of the support: at 973 K to the 'expanded' CeO2 phase [15,21] and at 1180 K to a hexagonal Ce203 ([21], this work). Formation of intermetallic compounds or alloys during reduction with hydrogen was reported for powder catalysts Pd/CeO2 at 873 K [15] and Pt/CeO2 at 773 K [2] and 1173 K [17] and also for another metal/oxide systems at similar temperatures [22-29]. Recently, Alexandrou and Nix [30] showed by using various surface sensitive methods that CeOx overlayer on Pd (111) surface dissolved into the bulk of metal when heated in ultra high vacuum (UHV) at or above 770 K. The chemical reaction with the support (alloying) modifies the reactivity of supported palladium in benzene hydrogenation [15] and in carbonization [28,29]. Similar effects may be expected also for hydration reaction, since it is known that addition of solute element to Pd reduces the maximum solubility of hydrogen ([3-hydride) and reduces the cx-[3 miscibility gap [31]. In fact, lowering of the hydrogen absorption by alumina supported Pd due to high temperature reduction at 870 K has been observed [32]. An important question concems the origin of the expansion of Pd lattice parameter observed in this experiment. Is it caused by alloying with Ce or by any other reason, e.g.,. B-hydride formation? We exclude the latter possibility because of the following reasons. It is known that [3-Pd hydride is stable under normal hydrogen pressure only up to 430 K [33] and therefore it can be formed in our experiments only during cooling in hydrogen. There is thus no reason, why it should form in samples reduced at 973 K and not in those reduced at 773 and 573 K. Moreover, our experiments with the samples cooled in vacuum and especially with Pd black (Table 1) clearly exclude this possibility. The second argument against hydride is its instability in the absence of hydrogen. EXAFS data showed that [3-Pd hydride formed in Pd/C and Pd/A1203 catalysts decomposed very quickly in pure Ar already at room temperature [34]. In our work we exposed the reduced samples to air before XRD and TEM analysis, so decomposition of eventual hydride would be even faster than in Ar. Nevertheless, we observed the 'expanded' Pd phase in samples stored in air for several days (Fig. 3) or even several months [15]. L. Kcpifiski, M. Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 215 Apart from [3-Pd hydride also other reasons such as formation of the supersaturated Pd-C solid solution [35-39,28,29] or a Pd-O solution [40] could bring about the structure effects similar to those observed in this work. We can exclude the other contaminants as possible solute in Pd in view of our EDS results, Fig. 1. The Pd-O solid solution characterised by Pd lattice expansion was observed only at very special conditions (CO-CO2 atmosphere, 553 K) [40], quite different from these used in this work, so that we can exclude this possibility. The Pd-C solid solution, if formed, could exhibit behaviour like this reported here (lattice expansion ca. 2.8%, long term stability in air) [35-39]. There are, however, strong arguments against it. First of all, we did not observed the lattice expansion in Pd black treated at the same conditions as Pd/CeO~ sample, cf. Table 1, as could be expected if hydrocarbon emission from the apparatus itself would occur [35,36]. Secondly, the Pd-C solution is known to decompose in hydrogen at 400-460 K [35-37], and thus could not survive our HTR treatment. Thirdly, the Pd-C lattice parameter reported in literature (2.8%) is larger than observed in this work (2.1%). And finally, in previous works we have shown that HTR at 973 K of Pd supported on silica and alumina reduced the ability of Pd to constitute the supersaturated Pd-C solid solution [28,29]. It is worth mentioning that our HTR experiments were performed in flow condi- tions, with continuous removal of water vapour, which favours the oxide reduction and Pd-Ce alloying. Another effect that could account for Pd lattice expansion is its straining due to epitaxial deposition on CeO2. It is very likely for small (few nm) Pd particles, but seems impossible for 50 nm particles (average particle size estimated from XRD -- see Table 2). ED and HRTEM results from even larger particle (Fig. 13) also confirm the Pd lattice expansion. 4.3. Decoration of Pd particles Recent HRTEM observations revealed that reduction at temperatures 873 K or higher caused the decoration of Pd [15] or Rh [11] particles supported on ceria. In this work we showed that in Pd/CeO2 reduced at 1100 K islands of the crystalline CeO2 are formed on large Pd particles. On [112] oriented Pd we observed special epitaxial orientation of CeO2 islands such that CeO2 (111) fringes are parallel or rotated by 60° to Pd (111) fringes. Alexandrou and Nix [30] reported that upon annealing in UHV at 573-973 K ceria overlayers form an ordered structures on the Pd (111) surface. 4.4. Mechanism of CeO2 reduction Process of CeO2 reduction in hydrogen is quite complex. The reason is that in addition to a number of intermediate phases present the process itself depends 216 L. K¢pitiski, M. Wotcyrz/Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 strongly on the surface area of the oxide [21,41], H20 partial pressure [42] and the presence of contamination, e.g., chloride [15]. In the first stage, up to ca. 770 K surface reduction takes place, followed by bulk reduction at higher tempera- tures, which eventually leads to hexagonal Ce203 at around 1200 K [21]. Below 1200 K nonstoichiometric oxides are obtained with the crystal structure being the modifications of the original fluorite type structure of CeO2 [42,43]. It has been shown that the lattice parameter of the pseudo-cubic cell determined for these oxides increases with decreasing oxygen content from 0.541 to 0.556 nm [21,44,15]. Results presented in this work, as well as literature data [21,15] show that maximum lattice expansion of fluorite-like CeO2 amounts to ca. 2.8% and then transformation into new hexagonal lattice occurs. The transformation temperature is ca. 1170 K ([21,42], this work), though there are indications that the cubic C-Ce203 structure (a = 1.11 nm) may occur as an intermediate phase at about 1073 K [21,43]. Important is that despite prolonged reduction at 1180 K (this work) or even at 1273 K [21], we still have a coexistence of hexagonal and fluorite-like ceria. Reduction of high surface ceria in H2 is additionally complicated by a simultaneous decrease of its specific surface area [45]. Two processes are involved in this effect: elimination of the microporosity (i.e., collapse of voids between CeO2 crystallites) as the first step and then, above 800 K, growth of the crystallites [45]. It appears, however, that for reduction temperatures above 873 K initial surface area has no significant influence on the phase transformations of ceria [21]. We can roughly estimate changes of the surface area of ceria in our Pd/ceria sample using average crystallite size obtained from XRD and TEM. For the initial sample (crystallite size 5.2 nm) we obtain surface area 160 m2/g taking ceria density 7.14 g/cm3 and assuming identical cubic crystallites not touching each other. This rather unrealistic assumption is, however, reasonably well fulfilled for high surface cerias treated at low temperatures [45]. At higher temperatures there is rapid decrease in the surface area due to collapse of voids between crystallites and growth of crystallite size. Obviously XRD can detect only the latter effect, but TEM (cf. Fig. 5) clearly shows that to some extent at 573 K, but quite extensively at 773 K, ceria crystallites undergo sintering. At 973 K, there is practically no empty space between ceria crystallites, so that specific surface area (30 m2/g) calculated from XRD data evidently overesti- mates the true exposed surface (i.e., available for adsorption) (cf. [45]). In our opinion the effect of sintering described above on ceria reduction in H2 can be described as follows. At 473 K surface reduction of ceria begins and at 620-670 K all cerium ions at a surface are reduced to 3 + [21]. For long reduction times, when due to the sintering the total surface area of ceria decreases, a fraction of these Ce3+ ions must move to the bulk since in hydrogen atmosphere there is no possibility to reoxidise them. The presence of Ce3+ ions (i.e., also oxygen vacancies) in ceria lattice further facilitates its sintering [46] and thus the process is auto-catalytic. It could possibly account for L. Kcpihski, M. Wotcyrz / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 197-220 217 exceptional reduction behaviour of a high surface ceria manifesting itself as a lack of a distinct gap between surface and bulk reduction [21 ]. In the presence of Pd complete surface reduction of ceria occurs already at room temperature [47] and therefore the effect described above is even more pronounced. This could explain rather high, if compared with literature [45], growth of ceria crystallite sizes in our sample during reduction at 573 and 773 K. An abrupt increase in ceria crystallite size at 973 K which coincides with its phase transformation to a new 'expanded' cubic structure must include extensive mobility of ceria species. It could possibly accelerate pits formation (discussed below) and facilitate Pd-ceria interaction (Pd-Ce alloy formation and Pd decoration). In an oxidising atmosphere, oxygen deficient fluorite-like CeOX exhibiting the expanded lattice parameter reoxidises very quickly even at room temperature to nearly stoichiometric CeOe [21,44,15]. However, the presence of additives as e.g. C1 ions from the metal precursor can stabilise the expanded CeO2 lattice [15]. The hexagonal Ce203 phase also reoxidises in air to fluorite like CeO2 but with much lower rate (Fig. 3, [21]). Our TEM results shine some light onto the process of CeO2-Ce203 transformation. It appears that the hexagonal phase grows on the fluorite CeO2 in an ordered manner. In the example shown in Fig. 7 [1210] oriented crystal of hexagonal phase builds on CeO2 (011) face in such a way that [ 111 ]CeOzl][0001 ]Ce203. Superstructure fringes with various spacings running parallel to CeO2 (111) fringes suggest that the orientation is not perfect and/or transformation to hexagonal phase is not completed. Generally speaking, the transformation must involve change of the stacking of densely packed Ce or O planes along the [111] direction from ABC sequence in CeO2 to AB sequence in Ce203 [48]. Our HRTEM results indicate that the process of ceria reduction at tempera- tures above 773 K involves an additional step, irreversible at room temperature, namely formation of pits at the ceria surface. Formation of pits in oxide supports upon heating in hydrogen has been reported already for Ni/Nb205 [49], Rh/V20s [50] and Ni/TiO2 [24].

Arrangement of oxygen ions in (111) and (100) ) ) ,) CeO2 crystal planes. involve migration of an unspecified partly reduced oxide [24,49], or layer by layer dehydration [50]. The metal facilitates (catalyses) the pit formation via activation of hydrogen and may eventually react with the removed material to form intermetallic compound [24]. In the present work we observed pits with well defined walls, undoubtedly corresponding to crystal planes of CeO2 (most often (111)-type). Taking into account the fact that generally only one set of (111) lattice fringes is visible on CeO2 crystallites having pits we postulate that (112) rather than (110) surfaces are attacked. In Fig. 17 top view of the (112) CeO2 surface is shown. Perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 17 and perpendicular to [111] direction there are cerium (C) and oxygen (O) atomic planes stacked in sequence...COOCOOC .... Arrangement of oxygen ions in (111) plane is shown in Fig. 18 and compared with that in (100) one. Ion packing in (111) plane is less dense than in (100) and therefore also their extraction, e.g.,, by hydration is probably easier. It is important also that the process can easily proceed into the bulk of the crystal through (112) surface leaving Ce species that could strongly interact with Pd eventually forming an alloy. For the [1 ll]Pdll[1 ll]CeO2 epitax- ial orientation observed in this work it appears that there is one Ce atom in (112) plane for every eight deposited Pd atoms, which gives the ratio corresponding to 12 at.-% concentration. From Fig. 17 it is seen that (112) plane of CeO2 has rather open character and contains natural sites that may act as centres for initiation of reduction or for nucleation of Pd particles. This sites are therefore analogous to 'nets' proposed by Sanchez and Gazquez [51] in their interpretation of SMSI effect. L. Kcpifiski, M.

Fax: (+48-71) 44 10 29 The effect of high temperature reduction (HTR) in hydrogen (up to 1180 K) on the microstructure of 9 wt.-% Pd CeO 2 catalyst was studied by HRTEM and XRD methods. Reduction of the catalyst at or above 973 K caused severe recrystallization of CeO2 and Pd with simultaneous strong interaction between the two components appearing as three phenomena: epitaxial growth of small Pd particles on CeO2 (most frequently with [111]Pd∥[111]CeO2); decoration of large Pd particles with ordered CeO2 overlayer and expansion of the lattice parameter of Pd (by 2.1%). The origin of the Pd lattice expansion is discussed and diffusion of Ce species into the Pd lattice seems to be the most probable one. HTR caused also phase transformations in the ceria support. At 973 K and 1100 K, whole CeO2 was transformed into oxygen deficient CeO x phase exhibiting the same or similar structure but with expanded lattice parameter (by 2.8%). At 1180 K most ceria was transformed into hexagonal A-Ce2 3. The CeO x phase appeared to be stable in hydrogen and in vacuum at room temperature, but upon exposure to air at room temperature it rapidly reoxidised to CeO2. Ce2O3 also reoxidised to CeO2 but much slower. Another consequence of HTR at or above 773 K was formation of pits in CeO2 crystallites, mainly on (112)-type crystal faces. The pits (1–10 nm) exhibited well defined walls parallel to CeO2 lattice fringes and they could possibly constitute nucleation sites for strongly bonded, epitaxial oriented Pd particles.
