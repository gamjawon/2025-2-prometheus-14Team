Diatomic catalysts inherit the advantages of single atom catalysts and use the adjacent metal-N sites for functional complementary and synergistic effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR). However, preparation of diatomic catalysts with high yield, Faradaic efficiency and stability together with low overpotential still remains challenging. In this work, we develop a nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ni-Zn diatomic catalyst, whose CO Faradaic efficiency of is higher than 92.0 % in the wide potential range of −0.57 ∼ −1.07 V vs RHE, and the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency is 97.5 % at −0.77 V vs RHE. And also, CN-NiZn performs an extraordinary stability for 30 h in the long-time durability test. More importantly, large-quantities (around 1.66 g) of Ni-Zn diatomic catalysts with remarkable catalytic performance can be prepared by this method. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy was tested to reflect the coordination environment and valence states around Ni and Zn atoms. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the synergistic effect between Ni and Zn binary metal sites largely reduces the energy barrier of the reaction to produce the intermediate *COOH, thus effectively increasing the selectivity of ECR. This work indicates that the introduction of another coordination metal can significantly affect the electronic structure of monatomic catalysts, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of ECR.

Among them, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) offers a promising global carbon neutral management strategy for high value-added chemicals and fuel production, promoting the sustainable development [4–7]. As CO is an important raw material of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process, it is one of the most common and important reduction products with the advantages of facile separation from liquid water to save costs [8]. Unfortunately, CO2 has a stable CO bond with the bond energy of 806 kJ mol−1 and requires high potential to activate it [9]. Further, in aqueous solutions, the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has a low overpotential and is usually more likely to occur than ECR reaction [10]. Moreover, the CO2 reduction reaction involves many electrons and protons, which leads to a wide variety of possible products. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to develop efficient CO generated catalysts for ECR technology. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) consisting of metal anchored nitrogen doped carbon (M-N-C) are widely used in ECR field because of their high metal utilization rates and eminent catalytic performances [11]. Among all kinds of SACs, Ni-N-C SACs have been widely studied and reported for their excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for CO product [12]. However, Ni SACs still suffer from the excessively high overpotentials (>600 mV), which can be attributed to the weak adsorption of *COOH on the Ni-N sites and sluggish kinetics of the first coupled proton-electron transfer [13,14]. Fe and Co SACs show low overpotentials for ECR, while CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) can only be reached above 90 % in a very narrow potential range with poor stability due to the difficult *CO desorption [15,16]. In addition, low-cost and earth-abundant Zn based catalysts have shown great promise for CO2-to-CO conversion, mainly manifested in low onset potential and high Faradaic efficiency, but they are always restricted by low current density and stability [8,17,18]. As an extension of SACs, diatomic catalysts (DACs) use the adjacent metal-N sites for functionally complementary and synergistic effects, which can effectively overcome the constraints of a single isolated site by regulating CO2 activation and intermediate formation/desorption to achieve rapid ECR kinetics [19]. Very recently, different heteronuclear DACs have been developed with higher than 95 % FECO such as Ni-Fe [20,21], Ni-Cu [22], Cu-Co [23] and Fe-Cu [24], which outperform most SACs. However, since the surface free energy of atomically dispersed catalysts increases with the reduction of particle size, the agglomeration of atoms is easy to occur. It is much more difficult to prepare large quantities of DACs in contrast of SACs [25]. Therefore, to obtain catalysts with high yield, activity, selectivity and stability together with low overpotential is the key to realize the industrialization of ECR. Herein, we prepared the Ni-Zn diatomic sites anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst (CN-NiZn) by pyrolyzing metal salts, phenanthroline and carbon black at 800 °C. Compared with CN-Ni SAC and CN-Zn SAC prepared by similar methods, CN-NiZn displayed more impressive catalytic performance. In the electroreduction of CO2-to-CO, CN-NiZn maintains remarkable CO selectivity with FECO higher than 92 % from −0.57 to −1.07 V vs RHE. The maximum FECO reaches 97.5 % at −0.77 V vs RHE with 15.0 mA cm−2 CO partial current. And also, CN-NiZn DAC performs an extraordinary stability for 30 h in long-time durability test. Most importantly, the gram-scale synthesized CN-NiZn DAC was successfully realized with a yield of up to 79.3 % and similar excellent electrocatalytic performances were also demonstrated, outperforming most reported atomically dispersed catalysts obtained only at microgram scales for ECR [26–28]. The tomically dispersion of CN-NiZn was observed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the coordination environment and valence states around Ni and Zn atoms were revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations uncover that Ni/Zn binary metal sites have strong CO2 activation ability. Due to the synergistic action between Ni and Zn, binary metal sites facilitate the formation of *COOH, thus promoting the CO production. Hopefully, this work provides crucial insights into the industrial application of DACs for ECR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of CN-metal catalysts 2.1.1 Synthesis of CN-NiZn Typically, 24.9 mg Ni(OAc)2·4H2O, 22.0 mg Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and 198.0 mg 1,10-phenanthroline (molar ratio of 5:1 for 1,10-phenanthroline: Ni/Cu) were dissolved in 30.0 mL ethanol and stirred vigorously at room temperature until completely dissolved. Then, 300.0 mg of carbon black was mixed with above solution at 60 °C for 5 h under continuous agitation to acquire a black solid. The black solid obtained was ground with a mortar, then calcined to 800 °C in nitrogen environment and held for 2 h, obtaining the final product. For comparison, CN-NiZn-600 and CN-NiZn-1000 were prepared through similar procedures to CN-NiZn, except being heated at 600 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. 2.1.2 Synthesis of CN-Ni Typically, 24.9 mg Ni(OAc)2·4H2O and 100.0 mg 1,10-phenanthroline (molar ratio of 5:1 for 1,10-phenanthroline: Ni/Cu) were dissolved in 30.0 mL ethanol and stirred at room temperature until completely dissolved. Then, 300.0 mg of carbon black was mixed with above solution at 60 °C for 5 h under continuous agitation to acquire a black solid. The black solid obtained was ground with a mortar, then calcined to 800 °C in nitrogen environment and held for 2 h, obtaining the final product. 2.1.3 Synthesis of CN-Zn Typically, 22.0 mg Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and 100.0 mg 1,10-phenanthroline (molar ratio of 5:1 for 1,10-phenanthroline: Ni/Cu) were dissolved in 30.0 mL ethanol and stirred at room temperature until completely dissolved. Then, 300.0 mg of carbon black was mixed with above solution at 60 °C for 5 h under continuous agitation to acquire a black solid. The black solid obtained was ground with a mortar, then calcined to 800 °C in nitrogen environment and held for 2 h, obtaining the final product (Fig. 1 a). 2.1.4 Synthesis of CN-NiZn at a large scale To prevent the aggregation of metallic particles caused by an increase in metal dosage, 78.0 mg Ni(OAc)2·4H2O, 69.5 mg Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and 642.5 mg 1,10-phenanthroline were dissolved in 70.0 mL ethanol and stirred at room temperature until completely dissolved. Then, 1300.0 mg of carbon black was mixed with above solution at 60 °C for 5 h under continuous agitation to acquire a black solid. The black solid obtained was ground with a mortar, then calcined to 800 °C in nitrogen environment and held for 2 h, obtaining the final product, named CN-NiZn-L. The obtained final product CN-NiZn-L is 1657.8 mg with high yield of 79.3 % (the yield is calculated as the ratio of the mass of final product CN-NiZn-L to the total mass of carbon black, 1, 10-phenonathroline, and nickel and zinc salts), which confirmed the mass-production of CN-NiZn. 2.2 Characterization of CN-metal catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a SMART LAB equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The Raman spectrum was measured by Raman spectrometer (Renishaw Invia). The contents of nickel and zinc in catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 725). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi) using Al-Kα radiation. The structural morphologies were surveyed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-JEM 2100 F). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-HAADF) of samples were performed on a FEI Titan G2 60–300. Both N and Zn K-edge spectra were recorded under fluorescence mode at the BL14W beamline in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The specific parameter conditions are detailly presented in the supporting information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural, morphological analyses of CN-NiZn The nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ni-Zn diatomic catalyst (CN-NiZn) was synthesized by pyrolyzing of nickel, zinc salts, phenanthroline and carbon black in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 1a). On this basis, the control samples CN-Ni and CN-Zn SACs were synthesized by similar processes. After all the catalysts were obtained, they were fully characterized. Firstly, powder XRD patterns of three prepared catalysts show two characteristic diffraction peaks of ≈24° and 44° (Fig. 1b), assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of graphite carbon separately [4]. The results reveal the absence of crystalline peaks corresponding to metal nanoparticles, suggesting the potential lack of metal nanoparticles in the catalytic material. Further confirmation is required through TEM and STEM characterization. The Raman spectra (Fig. A.1) obviously reveal the defective structures of nitrogen-doped carbon substrates. Specifically, two main characteristic peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 represent the disordered carbon with lattice defects (D band) and the ordered carbon with graphite phase (G band) separately [29]. Overall, the prepared catalysts show intensity ratios of D to G band (ID/IG) higher than 1.0, and such defective morphologies are conducive to uniform anchorage and dispersion of metal atoms. For CN-NiZn, CN-Ni and CN-Zn, the ratio of ID/IG is 1.23, 1.22 and 1.19, respectively. The graphitization degrees of these prepared catalysts are similar to each other, indicating that the doped heteroatoms have no effect on the graphitization structure inside the carbon black. ICP-OES analyses show that both Ni and Zn loading of CN-NiZn are 0.737 wt% and 0.566 wt%, respectively (Table A.1). The content of Ni in CN-Ni is 1.046 wt% and that of Zn in CN-Zn is 0.672 wt%. In contrast, CN-NiZn had the highest metal loading, indicating the possible presence of more metal active sites. In order to further analyze the microstructure, the as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by TEM. As we can see in Fig. 1c and Fig. A.2-A.4, the CN-NiZn is composed of carbon nanoparticles with the particle size of 30∼50 nm. After changing the type of metal salt, such as CN-Ni and CN-Zn, the catalysts obtained has similar micro morphologies to CN-NiZn. In addition, the presence of a crystal plane spacing of 0.35 nm can be seen in the enlarged HRTEM images of three catalysts, which is attributed to graphite carbon (002) [30]. Importantly, no metal nanoparticles were observed on the carbon framework, suggesting that Ni and Zn metals may be dispersed atomically in the CN-NiZn. The morphology of atomic dispersion cannot be clearly verified only by HRTEM. Therefore, the atomic dispersion of CN-NiZn was observed by STEM-HAADF (Fig. 1d and Fig. A.5). Due to the relatively high atomic numbers of Ni and Zn as metal atoms, we infer from the STEM-HAADF image (Fig. 1d) that the abundant bright spots observed on the CN NiZn carbon framework representing the Ni or Zn single atoms [31]. In order to understand more about the distribution of adjacent nickel and zinc atoms, all the atoms in Fig. 1d are performed a statistical analysis. If 3.0 Å is defined as the boundary between single-atom and dual-atom, more than 65 % of the bright spots can be considered to form diatomic pairs, which is consistent with previous reports [32]. In addition, the distances of atom pairs identified by the intensity profiles in Fig. 1c are all close to ∼2.6 Å (Fig. 1e), indicating a strong electron coupling between Ni and Zn atoms. Elements mapping reveals that C, N, Ni and Zn are evenly dispersed in the carbon skeleton (Fig. 1f). Besides, the microstructure of the monoatomic counterpart was also studied, and isolated bright spots of CN-Ni and CN-Zn were observed in the STEM-HAADF images (Fig. A.6 and A.7). No metal nanoparticles were found in the whole region of high resolution STEM-HAADF images, but Ni and Zn were obviously present in ICP-OES and EDS mapping results, indicating their atomic dispersion in the catalysts. Notably, because our synthesis method is based on modification of commercially obtained carbon black and does not require complex and costly post-processing such as acidification, it has a great potential for large-scale synthesis of such catalysts. In order to prove this, a CN-NiZn-L diatomic catalyst of up to 1.658 g with high yield of 79.3 % was successfully synthesized (Fig. A.8). The well-dispersed atom pairs can be also clearly seen in the corresponding STEM-HAADF, indicating that nickel-zinc is atomically dispersed on the nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Fig. 1g). XPS was used to analyze the elemental chemical states of prepared catalysts. Zn, Ni, O, N and C signals can be observed in the survey spectrum of CN-NiZn (Fig. A.9), but it is difficult to recognize Ni/Zn signals in the survey spectra of CN-Ni/CN-Zn possibly due to the existence of test errors. The high-resolution C 1s spectra of the prepared catalysts contain three peaks with centers of 284.5 eV (CC), 286.0 eV (CN) and 289.1 eV (CO) respectively, suggesting that N species are doped into the carbon framework (Fig. A.10) [33]. The high-resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. 2 a) of three catalysts consistently evidence the presence of pyridinic N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic N (400.5 eV), graphite N (401.3 eV) and oxide N (403.3 eV). Moreover, the porphyrin-like portion at 399.5 eV of CN-NiZn and CN-Ni can be considered as a metal-N bond, suggesting that Zn and Ni atoms are anchored on N-doped carbon [19]. On the contrary, no significant metal-N is observed in the N 1s spectrum of CN-Zn, which may lead to a marked decline in its electrocatalytic performance. As shown in the XPS Ni 2p spectra (Fig. 2b), the Ni 2p3/2 peak of CN-NiZn (855.0 eV) and CN-Ni (854.7 eV) is located between Ni0 (853.5 eV) and Ni2+ (855.8 eV) [34]. Therefore, the Ni atoms are likely to remain as ionic Niδ+ (0 < δ < 2) at the CN-NiZn and CN-Ni surfaces. Similarly, high-resolution Zn 2p spectra of CN-NiZn and CN-Zn demonstrate low-valence states of Zn atoms (Fig. 2c). Additionally, the upward shift (0.30 eV) of the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 in CN-NiZn compared with CN-Ni, and the downward shift (0.20 eV) of Zn 2p3/2 in CN-NiZn compared with CN-Zn suggest a possible electronic effect between Ni and Zn atoms. In addition, we also investigated the effect of calcination temperature on the structures and properties of catalysts. Except for CN-NiZn synthesized at 800 °C, we also synthesized CN-NiZn-600 and CN-NiZn-1000 at 600 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. Fig. A.11 shows the XRD results of three catalysts calcinated at different temperatures. In addition to (002) and (100) planes of graphitic carbon, CN-NiZn-1000 has three diffraction peaks at 44.3°, 51.7° and 76.3°, representing the (111), (200) and (220) planes of Ni0, respectively, proving the existence of metallic Ni nanoparticles [35]. Therefore, with the increase of calcinated temperature, metal nanoparticles may be formed, and HER will easily accompany with the subsequent ECR reaction to reduce the selectivity of the target product CO unexpectedly. ICP-OES was used to quantitatively analyze the metal content of all the catalysts and the results are shown in Table A.1. Specifically, when the calcinated temperature is raised to 1000 °C, CN-NiZn-1000 contains 1.21 wt% Ni, and Zn is almost completely volatilized (boiling point of Zn is 907 °C), leaving only Ni-N as the active sites in CN-NiZn-1000. In order to elucidate the changes of valence state and local structure around Ni and Zn atoms, synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) tests were performed. As illustrate in Fig. 2d, the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Ni K-edge for CN-NiZn show near-edge absorption between Ni foil and NiO, which suggests that the valence state of Ni in CN-NiZn is between 0 ∼ +2. Furthermore, a similar phenomenon is also observed in the Zn K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 2e). The result implies that the chemical valence state of Zn atoms in CN-NiZn is also between 0 ∼ +2, which is in good accordance with the XPS analysis. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can reflect the coordination structure information of metal atoms. In Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra, the peaks at 1.50 Å and 2.10 Å are classified as Ni-N and Ni-Ni bonds, respectively (Fig. 2f). A major peak at 1.44 Å from EXAFS spectrum of Ni K-edge for CN-NiZn corresponds to the Ni-N bond [36]. In addition, there is no metal Ni-Ni bond in the catalyst at 2.1 Å, which verifies again the atomic dispersion of metal species. Remarkably, we find a scattering path at 1.88 Å that is neither Ni-N nor Ni-Ni bonds in Ni K-edge EXAFS spectrum of CN-NiZn, and the quantitative least-squares EXAFS fitting analysis shows that this scattering path can be attributed to the Ni-Zn bond (Fig. A.13) [37]. According to the results of EXAFS fitting, Ni and Zn are embedded in carbon skeleton and are coordinated with three N atoms. Similarly, there are two peaks in the EXAFS spectrum of Zn K-edge for CN-NiZn at 1.54 Å and 1.89 Å, which belong to the Zn-N and Ni-Zn bonds respectively (Fig. 2g). EXAFS analysis further demonstrates the atomic dispersion of metal species and the formation of an atomic pair between Ni and Zn [38,39]. In order to further verify the coordination information of metal atoms, EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) was performed. Compared to the spectra of NiPc and Ni foil, there are two intensity maxima appears at 5.6 Å−1 and 6.3 Å−1 in the Ni WT-EXAFS of CN-NiZn (Fig. 2h and Fig. A.14), which can be assigned to Ni-N and Ni-Zn coordination individually. Among them, the Ni-Zn path in Ni WT-EXAFS is vaguer than that in Zn WT-EXAFS, which is due to the difference in signal strength that may result from the different modes of atomic vibration. Similarly, two intensity maxima at 4.8 Å−1 and 12.0 Å−1 are observed in the Zn WT-EXAFS of CN-NiZn, which can be ascribed to the Zn-N and Ni-Zn bond, respectively. The intensity at 13 Å−1 may be assigned to Zn clusters. WT-EXAFS analyses further demonstrate that the Ni and Zn metals are anchored to N-doped carbon skeleton in atomically dispersed forms, and some of them are bonded with each other. According to above characterization analyses, it can be determined that the Ni-Zn diatomic sites catalyst is successfully synthesized. Both Ni and Zn metals are uniformly dispersed on the carbon support in the form of atomic pairs, and there is a strong interaction between Ni and Zn. 3.2 Electrochemical performance of CN-NiZn The ECR activity of CN-NiZn is evaluated at three electrodes in a H-type cell with 0.5 mol L−1 KHCO3 electrolyte saturated with CO2. As illustrated in Fig. A.15, the CN-NiZn electrode shows very low activity for HER in the N2 saturated electrolyte, while the current density increases dramatically when saturated CO2 is applied, confirming the very high activity of CN-NiZn for ECR. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the CN-NiZn exhibits a considerable current density, which is higher than those of CN-Ni and CN-Zn at the same potentials according to linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results. Furthermore, by comparing the LSV curves of CN-NiZn and CN-NiZn-L, it is found that their activities for ECR are almost equal to each other, verifying the electrochemical performance stability of large-scale synthetic CN-NiZn DAC in this work (Fig. A.16). ECR selectivity was evaluated at various potentials (Fig. A.17), and the gas products were quantitatively analyzed by online gas chromatography. Over the entire potential range, only CO and H2 can be detected. The KHCO3 solution after electrolysis was analyzed by 1H NMR. Fig. A.18 shows that the only peak belongs to the characteristic peak of CO2-saturated KHCO3 aqueous solution, and no liquid product can be detected. As illuminated in Fig. 3b, CN-NiZn exhibits an excellent selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO. Its FECO is over 92.0 % in the potential range of −0.57 ∼ −1.07 V vs RHE (500 mV), which is around 200 mV wider than CN-Ni with similar FECO. Remarkably, CN-NiZn possesses a FECO of 97.5 % at −0.77 V vs RHE with 15.4 mA cm−2 current density, exceeding the maximum values of CN-Ni (92.0 %) and CN-Zn (26.5 %). As mentioned above, although CN-Ni SAC has high CO selectivity (FECO>90 %), it also has high overpotential (>600 mV), which increases energy consumption in the practical electrolysis process inevitably. By doping with Zn metal, the DAC reduces the overpotential of 200 mV, and reaches 92.6 % of FECO at −0.57 V vs RHE. The results indicate that there is a synergistic effect between atomically dispersed Ni/Zn-N sites, which effectively enhances the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. A.19, FEH2 of CN-NiZn is apparently lower than those of CN-Ni and CN-Zn at all applied potentials. It is worth noting that both CN-NiZn-L and CN-NiZn have excellent CO selectivity with FECO of 97.0 % at −0.77 V vs RHE, verifying that no significant performance degradation exists for large scale synthesized DAC in this work (Fig. A.20). Above analyses about the FE of aimed product reveals the splendid selectivity of CN-NiZn for CO production. Considering the increased activity and selectivity, CN-NiZn shows higher CO partial current density (jCO) throughout the entire potential range (Fig. 3c). Especially, CN-NiZn can deliver a high jCO of 30.1 mA cm−2 at −1.07 V vs RHE, which is 1.96 and ∼30 times higher than CN-Ni and CN-Zn, respectively. Above results further demonstrate the highest electrocatalytic activity of CN-NiZn. The superior jCO of CN-NiZn is due to the change of electron structure caused by heteronuclear coordination of Ni and Zn atoms [40]. Compared with CN-Ni (1728 h−1) and CN-Zn (47 h−1), the CO turnover frequency (TOF) of CN-NiZn reaches 5351 h−1 at −1.07 V vs RHE (Fig. 3d), suggesting that the diatomic site has better activity and faster electrocatalytic reaction rate than the single atomic site. Importantly, CN-NiZn shows excellent durability for ECR, with more than 90 % FECO and current density almost unattenuated (∼15 mA cm−2) for over 30 h during continuous electrolysis at −0.77 V vs RHE (Fig. 3e). As illuminated in Fig. A.21, TEM image of CN-NiZn after 30 h electrolysis shows that no nanoparticles or nanoclusters are formed by potential-induced agglomeration. Moreover, the XPS results show that the valence changes of Ni and Zn are negligible. The XPS spectral intensities of Ni2p and Zn2p for the catalyst before and after electrolysis show a striking similarity, underscoring the remarkable stability of CN-NiZn and its significant potential for electrochemical reduction applications (Fig. A.22). Compared to catalysts that have been reported, the ECR performance of CN-NiZn (high FECO and durability in a broad potential range) surpasses that of most M-N-C catalysts (Fig. 3f and Table A.2). To investigate the active sites in CN-NiZn further, we prepared a physically mixed catalyst by combining CN-Ni and CN-Zn in a mass ratio 1:1, followed by mechanical grinding. The resulting material is referred to as CN-Ni+CN-Zn, which represents the presence of isolated bimetallic single-atom sites. The performance of the CN-Ni+CN-Zn catalyst was then evaluated, as shown in Fig. A.23. The results indicate that CN-NiZn exhibits significantly higher selectivity and partial current density compared to the physically mixed CN-Ni+CN-Zn catalysts. This suggests that the superior catalytic activity of CN-NiZn is primarily attributed to the Ni-Zn diatomic structure rather than the mere physical coexistence of Ni and Zn single atoms in the catalyst. All the above results indicate that the Ni-Zn bond in CN-NiZn DAC exists and plays a positive role in the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The Tafel slope serves as a qualitative analysis for understanding the mechanism and electrochemical kinetics of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, exhibiting correlation with the system's overpotential and catalytic activity. A smaller Tafel slope is indicative of enhanced catalytic performance and expedited electrochemical kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4 a, CN-NiZn exhibits a Tafel slope of 178 mV dec−1, indicating that the first electron transfer is the rate-determining step (CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH), which is CO2 activation coupled with proton-coupled electron transfer [41]. Furthermore, Tafel slope of CN-NiZn is lower than those of CN-Ni (185 mV dec−1) and CN-Zn (323 mV dec−1), suggesting its favorable kinetics for CO generation and highlighting the significant role of synergistically utilizing adjacent Ni and Zn atoms in accelerating ECR. In order to obtain the charge-transfer characteristics of the catalysts in ECR, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed, and the result is shown in Fig. 4b. The semicircle of CN-NiZn is smaller than those of CN-Ni and CN-Zn SAC, demonstrating that CN-NiZn has the fastest charge transfer and the adsorbed CO2 can be readily converted into intermediate [42]. To reveal the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of catalysts, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was obtained by testing CV curves at different scanning rates (Fig. 4c and Fig. A.24). The CN-NiZn (63.72 mF cm−2) possesses a higher C dl compared with CN-Ni (20.67 mF cm−2) and CN-Zn (11.84 mF cm−2), indicating that CN-NiZn possesses a large ECSA, which is beneficial for exposing more active sites in the ECR. Based on above analyses, CN-NiZn has the outstanding electrochemical properties required by ECR. Additionally, we also studied the effect of calcinated temperature on the electrocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. A.25, the CN-NiZn sample calcinated at 800 °C has the highest current density during the entire potential range. Compared with CN-NiZn-600, CN-NiZn-1000 has a higher current density, indicating its excellent electrocatalytic activity. By comparing the CO selectivity of the catalysts calcinated at different temperatures, it can be found that CN-NiZn has the highest value. Moreover, the FECO of CN-NiZn-1000 reaches above 90 % at the potential range of −0.67 ∼ −0.87 V vs RHE and achieves the maximum value of 95.3 % at −0.67 V vs RHE. However, the CN-NiZn-600 barely achieves 90.6 % FECO at −0.87 V vs RHE. The reason for this result may be that the high temperature pyrolysis of CN-NiZn at 1000 °C causes the volatilization of Zn species (boiling point 907 °C), resulting in a large number of vacancies and defects, as well as more Ni sites doped in the material. Combined with the increased graphitization caused by high temperature and defects, CN-NiZn-1000 has higher catalytic activity and selectivity than CN-NiZn-600. At this time, the Ni-N sites are the active center of CN-NiZn-1000 and play a major catalytic role in the ECR. However, combined with the results of XRD and XPS above (Fig. A.11 and A.12), it is found that Ni nanoparticles are formed inside CN-NiZn-1000 with the calcination temperature raised to 1000 °C, and the existence of nanoparticles leads to more serious HER, thus weakening the activity and CO selectivity of CN-NiZn-1000. Based on above calcinated temperature control experimental results, we can conclude that 800 °C is the optimal calcination temperature for CN-NiZn synthesis. Considering that NiZnN6 in CN-NiZn is the active center of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, we investigate their electrochemical activity by the density-functional theory (DFT) in an attempt to gain a deep understanding of the mechanism for the enhanced ECR performance of CN-NiZn catalyst. Based on the EXAFS results of CN-NiZn, we chose NiZnN6-C as the model structure. In addition, NiN4-C and ZnN4-C were used as single-atom models for comparison (Fig. 5 a). The free energies from CO2 reduction to CO and HER were calculated, and the free energies of each intermediate on the active sites in CN-NiZn, CN-Ni and CN-Zn are shown in Fig. 5b. For the CN-NiZn catalyst, CO2 reduction to *COOH is usually the rate-limited step that identifies the overpotential of ECR. The Gibbs free energy changes of CN-NiZn, CN-Ni and CN-Zn from CO2 to *COOH are calculated as 0.81, 2.29 and 1.59 eV respectively, indicating that CN-NiZn has the strongest combining ability to *COOH. The Gibbs free energy change of the first step of CN-Ni is as high as 2.29 eV, which is much higher than that of CN-Zn. This suggests that adjacent Ni and Zn sites are more conducive to the formation of *COOH intermediates than SACs, which means that adjacent diatomic sites can greatly reduce the initial overpotential of CO2 to *COOH. The reason for this difference is that the combining of *COOH intermediates on CN-Ni is extremely weak, resulting in huge energy input, while CN-NiZn can appropriately reduce the free energy formed by *COOH and slightly improve the adsorption of *CO. Compared with CN-NiZn, the CO desorption process on CN-Ni and CN-Zn surfaces requires more energy, which may result in the adsorbed CO combining with protons to form other intermediates. Moreover, the Ni sites in CN-NiZn is denoted as CN-NiZn(Ni) and the Zn sites in CN-NiZn is denoted as CN-NiZn(Zn). As can be seen from Fig. 5c, the change of free energy is minimal when *COOH is formed at the Ni sites in CN-NiZn. In addition, the difference between CO2 reduction and H2 evolution limit potential (UL(CO2RR)-UL(H2)) is calculated to describe the selectivity of ECR (Fig. 5d), where the higher the positive difference, the higher the selectivity of CO. For CN-NiZn, the UL(CO2RR)-UL(H2) value (0.78 V) is higher than that of CN-Ni (0.41 V) and CN-Zn (0.49 V), indicating that CN-NiZn has the highest selectivity for converting CO2 to CO. This is highly consistent with the experimental results. In general, DFT calculation results show that the structure of loaded Ni and Zn sites can synergistically improve CO production with superior activity and selectivity. To explore the adsorption capacity of catalysts with diverse catalytic active sites for CO2 molecules, we computed the CO2 adsorption energies of NiZnN6-C, NiN4-C, and ZnN4-C, and constructed their adsorption configuration diagrams illustrating the interaction of CO2 molecules with different catalytic active sites (Fig.A.26). Subsequently, we calculated the corresponding adsorption energies, obtaining the data presented in Table A.3. A lower Ead value indicates stronger CO2 adsorption at the active site. When considering NiZnN6-C, calculations focused on both Ni and Zn sites, with the Ni site displaying significantly superior CO2 adsorption energy compared to the Ni site in NiN4-C. This further emphasizes that the synergistic effect of Ni and Zn enhances CO2 adsorption at the active site, facilitating the electrochemical reduction (ECR) reaction. Simultaneously, compared to the Zn site in ZnN4-C, the adsorption capacity of the Zn site in NiZnN6-C is slightly enhanced. In summary, CN-NiZn material exhibits a robust adsorption capacity for CO2, offering deeper insights into the heightened catalytic selectivity and activity of CN-NiZn. 4 Conclusions In summary, we report a Ni-Zn diatomic site catalyst (CN-NiZn) that can be prepared on a large scale. The diatomic configuration and coordination environment of the catalyst were confirmed by STEM-HAADF and synchrotron radiation XAS. The catalyst has excellent ECR performance, with 92.6 % FECO at a potential as low as −0.57 V vs RHE and stable FECO larger than 92 % in potential range of −0.57 ∼ −1.07 V vs RHE. The synergistic effect between Ni-Zn bimetallic active sites not only makes CO selectivity high (FECO=97.5 %), but also effectively improves the catalytic activity (jCO=30 mA cm−2). In addition, CN-NiZn has as long as 30 h catalytic stability, which makes it one of the best-performing catalysts. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the synergistic effect between Ni and Zn not only reduces the reaction barrier to produce the intermediate *COOH, but also appropriately reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus synergically promoting the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO. This work offers a new insight for the large-scale preparation of diatomic catalysts. At the same time, new opportunities are created to optimize the performance of single atom catalysts by manipulating the adjacent atomic sites interaction.

        "dc:description": "Diatomic catalysts inherit the advantages of single atom catalysts and use the adjacent metal-N sites for functional complementary and synergistic effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR). However, preparation of diatomic catalysts with high yield, Faradaic efficiency and stability together with low overpotential still remains challenging. In this work, we develop a nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ni-Zn diatomic catalyst, whose CO Faradaic efficiency of is higher than 92.0 % in the wide potential range of −0.57 ∼ −1.07 V vs RHE, and the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency is 97.5 % at −0.77 V vs RHE. And also, CN-NiZn performs an extraordinary stability for 30 h in the long-time durability test. More importantly, large-quantities (around 1.66 g) of Ni-Zn diatomic catalysts with remarkable catalytic performance can be prepared by this method. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy was tested to reflect the coordination environment and valence states around Ni and Zn atoms. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the synergistic effect between Ni and Zn binary metal sites largely reduces the energy barrier of the reaction to produce the intermediate *COOH, thus effectively increasing the selectivity of ECR. This work indicates that the introduction of another coordination metal can significantly affect the electronic structure of monatomic catalysts, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of ECR.",
