Tel.: +1 302 831 0642; fax: +1 302 831 2085. Flow reactor studies of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene have been performed on Na+ exchanged β-zeolite supported Pd, Ag and PdAg catalysts, as an extension of our previous batch reactor studies [W. Huang, J.R. McCormick, R.F. Lobo, J.G. Chen, J. Catal. 246 (2007) 40–51]. Results from flow reactor studies show that the PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite bimetallic catalyst has lower activity than Pd/Na+-β-zeolite monometallic catalyst, while Ag/Na+-β-zeolite does not show any activity for acetylene hydrogenation. However, the selectivity for the PdAg bimetallic catalyst is much higher than that for either the Pd catalyst or Ag catalyst. The selectivity to byproduct (ethane) is greatly inhibited on the PdAg bimetallic catalyst as well. The results from the current flow reactor studies confirmed the pervious results from batch reactor studies [W. Huang, J.R. McCormick, R.F. Lobo, J.G. Chen, J. Catal. 246 (2007) 40–51]. In addition, we used transmission electron microscope (TEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and FTIR of CO adsorption to confirm the formation of Pd–Ag bimetallic alloy in the PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst. Graphical abstract Alloying Pd with Ag reduced the acetylene hydrogenation activity but increased the selectivity. The apparent activation energy of acetylene hydrogenation on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite were estimated to be 8kcal/mol and 15.2kcal/mol. The formation of PdAg bimetallic particles on the Na+-β-zeolite support was confirmed by TEM, EXAFS, and CO adsorption using FTIR spectroscopy. Keywords Selective hydrogenation Acetylene Ethylene Pd Pd–Ag Bimetallic catalysts Na+-β-zeolite Flow reactor EXAFS CO adsorption TEM 1 Introduction Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is a very important industrial purification process for removing trace amount of acetylene from ethylene [2–5]. Currently, supported Pd catalyst is the commercial catalyst for this purification process [6–8]. However, supported Pd catalyst has poor selectivity at high conversion. Therefore, the addition of a second metal has been attracting considerable attention to enhance the selective hydrogenation of acetylene [5,9–13]. Ag has been reported as a selectivity promoter for the hydrogenation of acetylene into ethylene [9,10,14–16]. In addition to metal active sites, the supports also play an important role. Several reports have demonstrated that porous supports, such as pumice [17] and zeolites [18,19], show better activity, selectivity and stability than traditional Al2O3 and SiO2 supports. Our previous studies [1] also showed that cation exchanged zeolite can selectively adsorb acetylene over ethylene, leading to an increase in the local concentration of acetylene and consequently the hydrogenation selectivity. Results from our batch reactor studies [1] also showed that PdAg bimetallic catalysts have higher selectivity but lower activity than monometallic Pd catalyst on either γ-Al2O3 support or ion-exchanged β-zeolite support. In summary, fitting of the batch reactor experiments indicates that the rate constant of acetylene hydrogenation on PdAg bimetallic catalyst is smaller than that on Pd monometallic catalyst, while the selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation on PdAg is higher than Pd. In the current paper, we conducted flow reactor studies to directly compare PdAg bimetallic catalysts with their parent metals on Na+-β-zeolite support to confirm previous batch reactor results. Furthermore, we also characterized the materials using transmission electron microscope (TEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and FTIR of CO adsorption, to confirm the formation of bimetallic particles on the Na+-β-zeolite support. 2 Experiment 2.1 Catalyst preparation Supported catalysts were synthesized using the incipient wetness method as described previously [1]. Prior to metal addition, the β-zeolite (SiO2:Al2O3 =25, Zeolyst Company, CP814E) was Na+-exchanged using two treatments of 500mL, 0.01M NaNO3 followed by rinsing in DI water and drying at 383K. The compositions of the synthesized catalysts are as follows: 1.3wt% Pd/Na+-β-zeolite, 1.3wt% Ag/Na+-β-zeolite and 1.3wt% Pd–1.3wt% Ag/Na+-β-zeolite 2.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization TEM analyses were performed on spent catalysts from flow reactor studies using a JEOL 2010F equipped with a Schottky field emission gun operated at 200keV, with an ultra-high resolution pole piece providing a point resolution of 1.9Å. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) provided single-particle elemental analysis using an EDAX Phoenix X-ray spectrometer with a resolution of 134eV over a 40keV range. All TEM samples were prepared by grinding and suspending the spent catalyst in ethanol, sonicating the catalyst solution for 5min, and applying one to two drops of the sonicated solution to a 200- or 300-mesh lacey Cu grid that was then allowed to dry in air. 2.3 FTIR Spectra of adsorbed CO Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of CO adsorption was used to probe the surface properties of the catalysts. A Nicoet-510 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) detector was used for the CO adsorption experiments. The experiments were performed using a stainless steel IR cell with BaF2 windows, which allowed in situ reduction of samples and spectroscopic measurements of surface species as described previously [20]. Powder catalyst samples of ∼22mg were pressed onto a square tungsten mesh. A K-type thermocouple was spot-welded on the mesh to monitor the temperature. To remove water and other impurities, the IR cell was evacuated to a pressure below 10−6 Torr at room temperature over night. The catalysts were then reduced at 723K in 30Torr hydrogen for 30min. The ramping rate was 14K/min from room temperature to 723K. The cell was then evacuated and a high temperature flash (723K) was performed to remove any surface species generated during the reduction period. The reduction cycle was repeated three times before performing CO adsorption experiments. After the catalysts were reduced, 1Torr of CO was introduced into the IR cell for 10min at room temperature. Surface spectra were then recorded after each of the following procedures: pumping out for 5min at room temperature, after annealing to 373K for 30s and pumping out for 5min, and after annealing to 423K for 30s and pumping out for 5min. Due to the dipole–dipole interactions of CO with zeolite cations that often lead to the adsorption of CO on zeolites at room temperature [21,22], the spectra taken after annealing to 373K or 423K reveal the most useful information about the adsorption of CO on the metal sites. 2.4 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) Extended X-ray absorption fine structure technique was used to further confirm the formation of bimetallic particles on Na+-β-zeolite support. The EXAFS experiments using the Ag (25514eV) and Pd (24350eV) K-edges were conducted in the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory using beamline X-18B. Measurements were carried out in the transmission mode for the Pd K-edge and fluorescence mode for the Ag K-edge at room temperature. A Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used for the measurements. The energy of the X-ray absorption spectra was calibrated using reference Pd and Ag foils. The samples for the EXAFS measurements were pressed into a thin pellet with a diameter of 13mm and a thickness of ∼0.1mm. The samples were placed in a sealed Kapton cell and reduced under a 5% H2 in He for 60min at 723K using a ramping rate of 14K/min. Following reduction, the samples were cooled to room temperature in the reduction environment prior to the EXAFS measurement. The EXAFS measurements were performed in the 5% H2 environment. 2.5 Flow reactor studies The catalytic activity, selectivity to ethylene, and selectivity to ethane were evaluated using a fixed bed flow reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalysts were reduced in a 50% H2 in He at 723K for 60min. The ramping rate was 14K/min and the temperature was monitored by a K-type thermocouple outside the quartz reactor. The composition of the gas-phase reactant was a mixture of 2.5% C2H2, 2.5% C2H4 and 10% H2 balanced with He. The total flow rate was 220sccm. An online Gas Chromatograph (GC) (HP 5890) equipped with FID was used to analyze the reaction products. The capillary column was a GS-Carbon PLOT column (Agilent) and the sample gas was analyzed at a constant temperature of 343K. The reaction temperature was controlled by a water bath. Calibration was completed using a certified gas of 1000ppm C2H2, 1000ppm C2H4 and 1000ppm C2H6 balanced with He. To compare the catalyst selectivity at comparable conversion, 15mg Pd/Na+-β-zeolite catalysts balanced with 35mg quartz chips was used to compare with 50mg PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalysts. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TEM measurements TEM was used to characterize the particle size and composition of the spent catalysts from the flow reactor. Images of the Pd/Na+-β-zeolite, PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite and Ag/Na+-β-zeolite are shown in Fig. 1 . For the Pd/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst, the Pd particles are well distributed between 1nm and 3nm with few agglomerates ranging between 5nm and 10nm. The particle size for the PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite sample is larger than Pd/Na+-β-zeolite with more agglomerate formation. For the Ag/K+-β-zeolite catalyst, particles were polydispersed and ranged between 3nm and 30nm. The Pd dispersion of the Pd/Na+-β-zeolite is 23.1% and that of the PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite is 20.9% as determined using CO-chemisorption measurement [1]. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS) was used to analyze the composition of the particles in the PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst. The results from several nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2 . It is evident that the characteristic K-edge peaks for both Pd and Ag were observed in the same particle. Particles with only Ag or Pd were not found, indicating that the Pd and Ag were well mixed in the Na+-β-zeolite support and that the bimetallic particles were formed. The varying intensity ratios of the Pd K-edge and Ag K-edge in different particles indicate that the bimetallic content is slightly different for various particles on the Na+-β-zeolite support. 3.2 FTIR of adsorbed CO CO adsorption using FTIR was performed to probe the surface composition of the catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the IR spectra of adsorbed CO on Na+-β-zeolite, Pd/Na+-β-zeolite, Ag/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalysts. After exposing the catalysts to 1Torr CO for 10min, followed by evacuation for 5min, the presence of physisorbed CO on the zeolite substrates is detected at room temperature. After annealing the sample to 373K or 423K and pumping out for 5min, the physisorbed CO desorbs and only chemisorbed CO is present on the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. There is little chemisorbed CO present on either Na+-β-zeolite or Ag/Na+-β-zeolite after annealing to 373K or 423K. Two main vibration modes are observed on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite at 2080cm−1 and 1927cm−1, which are generally attributed to linear and bridge-bonded CO, respectively [23–25]. Only linear CO is present on PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite, with the peak centered at 2048cm−1. As reported previously [26], CO molecule can only form chemical bonds with Pd atoms when exposing a PdAg alloy to CO. The disappearance of the bridge-bond CO on PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite indicates that the Pd atoms are most likely isolated by Ag atoms on the catalyst surface, suggesting that the bimetallic alloy of PdAg is formed on the catalyst surface. 3.3 EXAFS measurements EXAFS measurements were performed on PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst to verify the formation of bimetallic particles on the Na+-β-zeolite. For comparison, the EXAFS measurements were performed on the Pd/Na+-β-zeolite as well. The fitting for Pd K-edge of Pd/Na+-β-zeolite is shown in Fig. 4 and the parameters from EXAFS fitting analysis and quality of fits are list in Table 1 . The fitted Pd–Pd distance is 2.735±0.003Å, which is slightly smaller than the bulk Pd–Pd first nearest number distance (2.751Å). This is due to the particle size effect on the interatomic distance. The coordination number of Pd–Pd is 10.3±0.6, which is consistent with the presence of some larger Pd nanoparticles observed in TEM measurement. The measurement of coordination numbers of heterometallic bonds in Pd–Ag system is not meaningful because the Z-contrast between Pd and Ag is too small. To solve the problem, the EXAFS spectra were fitted by assuming only Pd–Pd and Ag–Ag contribution for each element. The results of fitting are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. The first nearest neighbor distances of Pd–Pd and Ag–Ag in bulk metals are 2.751Å and 2.889Å, respectively. In principle, the first nearest neighbor distance should be similar or slightly smaller than in the bulk if the Pd and Ag segregate to form monometallic nanoparticles. In the case of alloying, the nearest neighbor distance should be an intermediate value between the two monometallic distances. As shown in Table 1, for PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite, the Pd–Pd distance increase to 2.812±0.003Å and the Ag–Ag distance decrease to 2.822±0.004Å, which indicate that the Pd and Ag form bimetallic alloy on the Na+-β-zeolite support. The combined coordination number for Pd edge and Ag edge is 10.7±0.6 and 10.4±0.7, respectively. It is consistent with the sizes of nanoparticles observed in TEM measurements (Fig. 1) based on previous correlations of particle sizes with coordination numbers [27]. 3.4 Flow reactor studies To corroborate the conclusions from our previous batch reactor studies [1], here we utilize the flow reactor system to study the acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of ethylene. The definitions of conversion ( X C 2 H 2 ) , selectivity ( S C 2 H 6 ) to byproduct (C2H6), and selectivity to ethylene ( S C 2 H 4 ) are adopted from the literature and are defined as (1) X C 2 H 2 = C 2 H 2 , feed − C 2 H 2 , final C 2 H 2 , feed (2) S C 2 H 6 = C 2 H 6 , final C 2 H 2 , feed − C 2 H 2 , final (3) S C 2 H 4 = C 2 H 4 , final − C 2 H 4 , feed C 2 H 2 , feed − C 2 H 2 , final To compare the catalysts at comparable conversions, 15mg Pd/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst was used as compared to 50mg PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite catalyst. As shown in Fig. 6 , the C2H4 selectivity on PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite was nearly three times higher than on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite at a similar conversion at 333K. On the other hand, the C2H6 selectivity on PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite, which was the undesirable byproduct, was only 1/3 of that on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite. The Ag/Na+-β-zeolite did not show any activity for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene (Figure not shown). This is consistent with the batch reactor results that PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite shows lower activity but higher selectivity than Pd/Na+-β-zeolite. The apparent activation barrier of acetylene hydrogenation on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite was also measured. The Arrhenius plot is shown in Fig. 7 and the estimated apparent activation barrier on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite is 8.0kcal/mol and 15.2kcal/mol, respectively. The activation energy of acetylene hydrogenation varies with different supports and experimental conditions. Bodnariuk and coworkers [28] reported values between 15kcal/mol and 16kcal/mol on two types of Al2O3 supported Pd under industrial conditions. Weiss and coworkers[18] have found that the activation energy was about 13–14kcal/g mol on several zeolite supported Pd catalysts. Duca et al. [29] compared Pd catalysts supported on pumice and alumina and reported activation energy values ranging from 8.6kcal/mol to 25.2kcal/mol. The activation energy on PdAg/α-Al2O3 was also reported by Bond et al. [30] to be 20.1±0.5kcal/mol between 293K and 353K. The activation barriers of acetylene hydrogenation on Na+-β-zeolite supported Pd and PdAg catalysts are slightly smaller than the literature reports on other substrates. However, the trend is consistent with the rate constant of acetylene hydrogenation on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite derived from batch reactor studies [1]. 4 Conclusions We found that alloying Pd with Ag reduced the acetylene hydrogenation activity but increased the selectivity. The apparent activation energy of acetylene hydrogenation on Pd/Na+-β-zeolite and PdAg/Na+-β-zeolite were estimated to be 8kcal/mol and 15.2kcal/mol. In addition, the formation of PdAg bimetallic particles on the Na+-β-zeolite support was confirmed by TEM, EXAFS, and CO adsorption using FTIR spectroscopy.
