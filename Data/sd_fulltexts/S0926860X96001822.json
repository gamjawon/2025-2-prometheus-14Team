However, they deactivated faster than ZSM-5. Increase in 2,6-selectivity is related to the prevention of isomerization of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene to 1,6-dimethylnaphthalene on strong acid sites. Some large-pore zeolites, such as ZSM-12, beta (BEA) and Y, were also used for the methylation of methylnaphthalene. On these large-pore zeolites, the shape-selectivity decreased with the increase in zeolite pore size, however, much higher 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene yields were obtained compared with on medium-pore zeolites. The concentrations of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene in ten isomers produced on all the zeolites used were higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration. In all the large-pore zeolites used, BEA showed the highest methylation activity, highest 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene yield and longest catalyst life. This performance is attributed to its strong acidic property and three-dimensional 12-oxygen-memberring large-pore structure without supercage. Furthermore, the catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposit on BEA could effectively be prevented by using tetralin as the solvent of (3-methylnaphthalene.

Pu, T. Inui /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 305-316 engineering plastics with good thermal and mechanical stability [1,2]. Among 2,6-DANs, 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (2,6-DMN) is regarded as the most suitable one with its high reactivity in the process of oxidation into 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid [3]. Therefore, effective separation and synthesis of 2,6-DMN from ten DMN isomers has been studied extensively. Methylation of naphthalene and/or methylnaphthalene (MN) on H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst to synthesize 2,6-DMN was reported by several research groups [4-7]. In all these studies, ZSM-5 showed a high and/or selectivity, approximately 80%. In order to improve the performance of H-ZSM-5, the selective neutralization of acid sites located on the external surface of zeolite crystallites has been tried by our intrinsic mechanochemical method and significant improvement in catalyst life and shape-selectivity was observed [8] indicating the decrease in reactions occurring on the external surface. However, the ratio of 2,6-DMN/2,7-DMN produced on ZSM-5 was almost 1 and the yield of 2,6-DMN on ZSM-5, having a 10-oxygen-member-ring medium-pore structure, was still not high. In our previous study, in separation of DMN isomers, the adsorptive capacity and adsorption selectivity of zeolite BEA could be modified remarkably by the substitution of transition metal elements which affected the adsorption energy of DMNs [9]. Therefore, in the present study MFI metallosilicates, which were synthesized by isomorphous substitution of Fe and Zn for Al in ZSM-5, were used anticipating an improvement in the shape-selectivity, especially of the 2,6DMN/2,7-DMN ratio in methylation of MN, as well as some large-pore zeolites, such as ZSM-12, zeolite beta (BEA) and Y, to increase the yield of 2,6-DMN. Furthermore, the influence of other coexisting hydrocarbons on the catalyst life was also investigated on the BEA catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation All the zeolites used in this study were prepared by the hydrothermal method. ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 100), Fe-MFI (Si/Fe = 100), Zn-MFI (Si/Zn = 100) and non-metal-MFI silicates were synthesized by the rapid crystallization method [10,11]. Water glass (no. 3, 29 wt.-% Si02, Koso) and tetra-n-propylammonium bromide (TPABr, Tokyo Kasei) were used as the source of Si and organic template, respectively. ZSM-11 (Si/Al = 50) was synthesized from a gel mixture of 10 (TBA)20100 Si02-A1203-2000 H20 at 150 for 5 days [12,13]. Tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH, 40 wt.-%, Aldrich) and silica sol (30 wt.-% Si0z, S.-B. Pu, T. Inui /Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 305-316 307 Syokubai Kasei) were used as the organic template and the Si source, respectively. ZSM-12 (Si/Al = 60) was crystallized at 160 for 8 days. Methyltriethylammonium chloride (MTEACl, Tokyo Kasei) and water glass (no. 3, 29 wt.-% Si02, Kishida) were used as the organic template and the Si source, respectively [14,15]. The composition of gel mixture to synthesize BEA was set at 6 Na20-25 (TEA)20-100 Si02-A1203-1555 H20, using silica sol (30 wt.-% Si02, Syokubai Kasei) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 40 wt.-%, Aldrich) as the Si source and the organic template, respectively [ 16,17]. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 135 for 6 days. Zeolite Y (Si/Al = 2.5) was synthesized as reported in our previous paper [18]. The obtained crystals of these zeolites were washed with distilled water until the pH value of washing water reached 7-8, and were dried over night in an oven at 110. They were calcined at 540 in air for 3.5 h to remove the template, and then ion-exchanged twice in 1 N NH4N03 solution at 80 for 1 h followed by calcination at the same condition to obtain the H form. The protonated zeolites were modified by a mechanochemical method as reported in our other paper [8], followed by pelleting and then calcined at 500 in air for 3 h. The tableted catalyst pellets were crushed and sieved to 8-15 mesh to provide the reactions. The composition of catalysts expressed by weight was 70% zeolite + (4.4% Ba0/25.6% Si02). 2.2. Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by a Shimadzu XD-DI diffractor equipped with Ni-filtered monochromatic CuKa radiation (30 kV, 30 mA). The acidic properties were measured by temperature-programmed desorp tion of pre-adsorbed NF 13 (NH 3-TPD) using a Rigaku Thermoflex TG 8110 thermogravimeter connected with a TAS 100 thermal analysis station. TPD profiles were obtained from the differential of the integral curve of weight-loss from 80 to 600 at a constant heating rate of 10/min in 50 ml/min N2 flow. The coke deposited on catalysts after the reaction was measured by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) on a Shimadzu DT-40 thermo gravimeter with a heating rate of 10/min in a 40 ml/min air flow. The coke content was measured by the weight-loss in TPO ranging from 300 to 600. 2.3. Reaction method An ordinary fixed-bed flow type reactor was used for the reaction in gas-phase.

NH3-TPD profiles of various MFI metallosilicates. these MFI metallosilicates are plotted in Fig. 2. Both the amount of acid sites and acidic strength were in the following order; ZSM-5 > Fe-MFI > Zn-MFI > non-metal-MFI. This is the same result as reported in our previous studies [21,22]. 3.2. Methylation of methylnaphthalene on various MFI metallosilicate catalysts All these MFI metallosilicates were used to the methylation of a-MN and MN mixture by methanol. Table 1 summarizes the conversions of MN (total conversion of a-MN and MN ignoring the isomerization), product distributions and selectivities in the initial period of the reaction. The conversion of MN showed the order ZSM-5 > Fe-MFI > Zn-MFI > non-metal-MFI, which is the same order as the acidic property measured by NH 3-TPD, suggesting that conversion of MN prefers to occur on strong acid sites. The main products were naphthalene (N), ethylnaphthalene (EN), dimethy1naphthalene (DMN) and hydrocarbons not lighter than trimethylnaphthalene (TMN + ). On Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates, the percentages of N and TMN + produced were obviously less than those on ZSM-5. It implies that demethylation and polymethylation occur on the strong acid sites of ZSM-5. Among all the MFI metallosilicates used in the present study, Fe-MFI exhibited the highest selectivity to DMN, i.e. 85.8%. In the DMN isomers formed, none of a ,cx-DMN isomers (1,4-DMN, 1,5-DMN and 1,8-DMN) can be detected on any catalyst. The (3-selectivities (total of 2,6-DMN, 2,7-DMN and 2,3-DMN) increased greatly on Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates, compared with on ZSM-5. On ZSM-5, the ratio of 2,6-DMN/2,7-DMN and 1,6-DMN/2,7-DMN were almost 1. On the other hand, on Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI, 1,6-DMN was not detected and the ratio of 2,6-DMN/2,7-DMN increased up to approximately 1.6. It suggests that the increase in selectivity to 2,6-DMN should 310 S.-B.

On the other hand, Fe-MFI lost most of its activity within 2 h while Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI lost most of their activities within 1 h on stream. After reacting at 400 for 4 h on stream, compared with on ZSM-5, very few coke was deposited on Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates. The deactivation on ZSM-5 should be attributed to the blockage of pore channels, while the deactivation on Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates should be attributed to the coverage of acid sites. 3.3. Acidic property of various medium and large-pore zeolites The NH 3-TPD profiles of various medium and large-pore zeolites are shown in Fig. 4. Based on the Si/Al ratios of zeolites used in the present study, acidic strength judged from the peak at high temperature side showed an order of ZSM-5 = ZSM-12 > BEA > ZSM-11 > Y. As for amount of acid site, an order of Y > BEA > ZSM-5 = ZSM-12 ZSM-11 was observed. 3.4. Methylation of methylnaphthalene on various medium and large-pore zeolite catalysts Various medium-pore (ZSM-11 and ZSM-5) and large-pore zeolites (ZSM-12, BEA and Y) were used for the methylation of MN. The change in DMN yield with time on stream are shown in Fig. 5. ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 maintained an almost constant DMN yield until 4 h on stream, however, the values of DMN yield were less than 5%. It is considered that the 10-oxygen-member-ring medium-pore channels of ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 resist the diffusion of bi-nuclear aromatics remarkably. On the other hand, in the cases of ZSM-12 and Y having 12-oxygen-member-ring large-pore structures abrupt deactivation were ob- 312 S.-B. Pu, T.

Catalyst: ZSM-11 (O ); ZSM-5 (); ZSM-12 (O); BEA (); Y (A ). served, although the initial activities were high. It is thought that the deactivation was caused by coke formation in one-dimensional pore channels for ZSM-12 and in supercages for zeolite Y, respectively. In all the zeolites used, BEA showed the highest initial activity and the deactivation on it was more gradual than those on ZSM-12 and Y. This must be ascribed to its three-dimensional large-pore (12-oxygen-member-ring) channels without supercages. It is obvious that the pore structure like zeolite BEA is necessary for effective conversion of bi-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. ZSM-11 (5.4 X 5.3 has almost the same pore size as ZSM-5 (5.6 X 5.3 H 5.5 X 5.1 has, but the DMN yield on ZSM-11 was only about 1/3 of that on ZSM-5. Compared with zeolite BEA (7.6 X 6.4 H 5.5 X 5.5 , zeolite Y (7.4 has a larger pore size and more acid sites, however, the DMN yield on zeolite Y was lower. From above evidences, it can be concluded that the methylation of MN prefers to occur on the strong acid sites. The product distributions on all these zeolites in the initial period of reaction are shown in Fig. 6. With the increase in pore size of zeolite, the percentage of naphthalene (N) increased while that of ethylnaphthalene (EN) decreased. The increase of naphthalene could be explained that the demethylation and/or disproportionation of MN increases with the increase in pore size of zeolite. The selectivity (sum of 2,6-DMN, 2,7-DMN and 2,3-DMN) decreased with the increase in zeolite pore size, however, 2,6-DMN yield showed the highest value, i.e. 3.72%, on zeolite BEA, which is over 4 times as much as on ZSM-5. Table 2 lists the details of the distribution of DMN isomers produced on various medium and large-pore zeolites, as well as the thermodynamic equilibrium data at 400. None of a,a-DMN isomers (1,4-DMN, 1,5-DMN and 1,8-DMN) was detected on medium-pore zeolites, ZSM-11 and ZSM-5. Although a,a-DMNs were formed on large-pore zeolites, ZSM-12, BEA and Y, ZSM-5 ZSM-12 BEA S.-B. Pu, T.

In most cases, 2,3-DMN and 1,2-DMN, which were considered to be difficult to isomerize compared to other isomers, were produced less than at the equilibrium concentration. The selectivity to 2,6-DMN decreased with the increase in pore size, however, 2,6-DMN concentrations formed on all the zeolites used in the present study were higher than the equilibrium value, which is as low as 12% [1]. ~.5. Influence of solvent on the catalyst life of zeolite BEA Instead of a-MN, some other hydrocarbons, such as mesitylene and tetralin, were used as the solvents in the methylation of MN on BEA catalyst.

The initial methylation activity, expressed by the hydrocarbons coexisting with MN, showed the following order; mesitylene > tetralin > cx-MN. This is the reverse order of reactivity of the coexisted hydrocarbons themselves. Abrupt deactivation was observed when oc-MN was mixed with MN as the reactant. On the other hand, the deactivation became gradual when mesitylene was used as the solvent, and BEA maintained almost the same methylation activity until 4 h on stream in the case of tetralin coexisting with MN. After reacting for 4 h on stream, coke deposited on BEA was analyzed by TG in air flow. The amount of coke deposited calculated from weight-loss from 300 to 600 in TPO measurement is summarized in Table 3. Compared with the cases of a-MN and mesitylene coexisting with MN, the coke deposited on BEA was much less when tetralin was used as solvent of MN. Characteristics of the side reactions of the solvents were also investigated through identification of their by-products by GC-MS. The main reactions of a-MN and mesitylene are isomerization and demethylation to naphthalene, and benzene derivatives, respectively. However, the conversion of mesitylene was Table 3 Influence of solvent on the coke deposited on BEA in methylation of MN Solvent Coke deposited (wt.-%) a a-MN 14.1 Mesitylene 15.1 Tetralin 10.2 a Weight-loss in TPO measurement ranging from 300 to 600, 10/n, 40 ml/min air flow.

Inai/Applied Catalysis A: General 146 (1996) 305-316 315 much lower than that of a-MN. On the other hand, the main reaction of tetralin on BEA is dehydrogenation. It indicates that the deactivation on BEA must be mainly attributed to the demethylation of a-MN and mesitylene. It is thought that when tetralin coexists with MN, active hydrogen, which is produced through dehydrogenation on the vicinity of active sites, prevents the coke formation and/or removes the coke formed on the catalyst [23]. 4. Conclusions MFI metallosilicates synthesized by the rapid crystallization method were used for the methylation of MN. Compared with ZSM-5, Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates showed both higher selectivities to DMN and higher 2,6-DMN/2,7-DMN ratios. However, conversion of MN on metallosilicates was lower and the deactivation was faster than on ZSM-5. On large-pore zeolites, much higher 2,6-DMN yields were obtained than on ZSM-5. Although the shape-selectivity decreased with the increase in pore size, the selectivities to 2,6-DMN on all the zeolites used were higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration. The deactivation on ZSM-12 and Y were very fast owing to the coke formation in their one-dimensional pore channels and supercages, respectively. In all the zeolites used, BEA showed the highest yield of 2,6-DMN and the deactivation was more gradual than on ZSM-12 and Y. The three-dimensional large-pore structure without supercage like BEA is necessary for bi-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbon conversion. Furthermore, the catalyst life of BEA can be prolonged markedly by using tetralin as the solvent for MN, caused by dehydrogenation on the vicinity of active sites to prevent coke formation and/or remove the coke formed.

Tel.: (+81-75) 753-5682; fax: (+81-75) 771-7285 In methylation of methylnaphthalene, Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and non-metal-MFI silicates with weaker acidic properties exhibited lower activities and higher selectivities to 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene as compared with ZSM-5. However, they deactivated faster than ZSM-5. Increase in 2,6-selectivity is related to the prevention of isomerization of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene to 1,6-dimethylnaphthalene on strong acid sites. Some large-pore zeolites, such as ZSM-12, beta (BEA) and Y, were also used for the methylation of methylnaphthalene. On these large-pore zeolites, the shape-selectivity decreased with the increase in zeolite pore size, however, much higher 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene yields were obtained compared with on medium-pore zeolites. The concentrations of 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene in ten isomers produced on all the zeolites used were higher than the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration. In all the large-pore zeolites used, BEA showed the highest methylation activity, highest 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene yield and longest catalyst life. This performance is attributed to its strong acidic property and three-dimensional 12-oxygen-memberring large-pore structure without supercage. Furthermore, the catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposit on BEA could effectively be prevented by using tetralin as the solvent of β-methylnaphthalene.
