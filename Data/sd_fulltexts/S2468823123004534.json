College of Chemistry Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology Maoming 525000 PR China Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate, a typical product of CO2 captured in an alkaline solution, with glycerol (GLY) as a hydrogen donor to formate (FA) and lactate (LA) is a sustainable and green approach for simultaneous valorization of CO2 and the major byproduct from biodiesel production. Conventional monometallic noble metal catalysts can catalyze this transfer hydrogenation reaction, but generally required a high reaction temperature, leading to a low yield of FA. In this work, N-doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages (NCSWCs) supported PdPt alloy catalysts were prepared and their electronic structures were determined by Valence Band Spectra (VBS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). It was found that the relationship between the d band center and catalytic activity exhibits volcano-shaped behaviors, where Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs is on the top of the curve, 85.4% of GLY conversion with 67.3% yield of LA and 56.5% yield of FA can be achieved at 200 °C. DFT calculations also revealed that Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs possessed an intermediate d band center, which tunes the adsorption and dissociation energy of H species on its surface, allowing maximum H transfer during the transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate, leading to high catalytic activity. Such a d band center catalyst tuning could be efficient way to design new catalysts.

However, direct conversion of CO2 in flue gas has been rarely reported because the CO2 concentration in flue gas is quite low [2]. As a result, catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 normally requires high purity CO2 feedstock which is captured and purified from flue gas using an alkaline absorbents [3]. If bicarbonate, a typical product of CO2 captured in alkaline solution, can be directly hydrogenated to formate/formic acid (FA), it will simplify the traditional CO2 capture and utilization process and also the generated FA is an ideal hydrogen storage material [4]. On the other hand, the hydrogen gas used for hydrogenation reactions is produced by the steam reforming of natural gas, which is nonrenewable [5]. If a catalytic transfer hydrogenation strategy is adopted for the conversion of bicarbonate to FA by using a renewable but non-H2 source, such as methanol, isopropanol, or glycerol (GLY), as the hydrogen donor, it is undoubtedly a green and sustainable way for CO2 valorization. GLY, as a byproduct in the production of biodiesel, is an ideal hydrogen donor as it is seriously oversupplied in the market [6,7]. Moreover, GLY can be converted into high-value lactate/lactic acid (LA) through the dehydrogenation in the transfer hydrogenation reaction, which not only increases the economic benefit of biodiesel industry, but also reduces the cost of CO2 conversion. Shen, et al. first reported that bicarbonate could be hydrogenated to FA by using GLY as the hydrogen donor, which is ultimately converted to LA, at hydrothermal conditions without employing any catalysts [8]. Su, et al. screened a series of transition metal catalysts, such as Pd/AC, Pt/AC, Ru/AC, and Rh/AC, for the transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate with GLY and concluded that Pd/AC possessed the best catalytic activity in term of FA yield. However, the yields of FA and LA could only reach 30% and 55%, respectively, at 240 °C [9]. Recently, Ru and Pt based catalysts have also been prepared for this reaction, [10–12] however, their catalytic activities are still weak so that the reaction needs to be conducted at high temperature (240–250 °C), leading to a low yield of FA. The transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate with GLY includes the dehydrogenation of GLY and hydrogenation of bicarbonate. For the dehydrogenation of GLY under basic conditions, Siddiki, et al. used a series of transition metal catalysts to catalyze this reaction and found that there existed a volcanic-curve relationship between the catalytic activity and the d band center. Pt possessed the best activity due to its intermediate d band center relative to the Fermi level [13]. As for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate, Pd, Ru, and Au catalysts can effectively catalyze this reaction, whereas Pd is the most widely studied catalyst among them [14,15]. Recent studies have found that the catalytic activity of Pd catalysts can be improved by alloying with the second metal. For example, the catalytic activity of TiO2 supported PdAg catalysts in the hydrogenation of bicarbonate was more than 10 times higher than that of Pd/TiO2. The enhanced catalytic activity was strongly correlated with the increased electron density of Pd due to electron donation from Ag [16]. The improvement in the catalytic activity can be also achieved by alloying Pd with Co, Ni and Cu [17–19]. In these studies, although d band center was not employed as a descriptor for the catalytic activity, the increase of the electron density on Pd caused by alloying was considered as an important reason for the high catalytic activity, which usually leads to the downshift of the d band center of Pd catalysts. Considering that Pd and Pt are catalytically active for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate and dehydrogenation of GLY, respectively, and alloying Pd with Pt would lead to the downshift of the d band center to the Fermi level, [20] resulting in the enhancement of catalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate with GLY. In this work, PdPt alloy catalysts supported on N-doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages (NCSWCs) were prepared by a simple incipient wetness impregnation method. By adjusting the composition of PdPt alloy, the d band centers of PdPt alloy catalyst can be finely tuned to achieve high catalytic activity in transfer hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, the NCSWCs support combines the advantages of N-doped carbon materials with unique hollow structures and is expected to be effective for further improving the catalytic activity of PdPt alloy catalyst in this reaction [21–23]. This work could provide a sustainable and green option for the simultaneous valorization of CO2 and GLY. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of NCSWCs supported PdPt alloy catalysts The dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) was used as the hard template and the corresponding N-doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages (NCSWCs) were prepared following the procedures in our previous work [21]. After that, an incipient wetness impregnation method was used to prepare NCSWCs supported PdPt alloy catalysts (PdPt alloy/NCSWCs) with H2PtCl6·6H2O and Pd (NO3)2·2H2O aqueous solution with required concentrations to achieve 2% of metal loadings. The obtained sample was dried in an oven at 80 °C under vacuum overnight. Before the activity tests, the catalysts were reduced under 10% H2 in Ar mixture gas at 300 °C for 5 h. In addition, NCSWCs supported PdPt alloy catalysts (PdPt alloy/NCSWCs-R), which were prepared by NaBH4 reduction method and N-doped carbon porous materials supported PdPt alloy catalysts (PdPt alloy/NPC), [22,24] which were synthesized by the above incipient wetness impregnation method, were used as the reference catalysts. 2.2 Catalyst characterization TEM images were recorded by using Thermo Scientific Talos F200S. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. XPS spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi (Al Kα radiation source, ultrahigh vacuum ∼1 × 10−10 Torr, hν = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated by taking the C 1 s peak (BE = 284.8 eV) as a reference. The loadings of Pt and Pd were measured on an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (Thermo Fisher iCAP7600 series). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at −196 °C. The metal dispersion was determined with CO pulse chemisorption using Autochem II 2920 and the dispersion was calculated assuming the stoichiometry factor to be 1 for Pt and 2 for Pd [25,26]. 2.3 Catalytic activity evaluation The transfer hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 100 mL stainless steel microreactor. The appropriate amounts of GLY, bicarbonate/carbonate, and catalyst were added into DI water to make the total volume of solution 30 mL in the reactor. The reactor was then sealed, purged with high purity N2 gas three times, and then charged with N2 to 3.0 MPa. After the reaction finished, agitation was stopped and the reactor was cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the catalysts were removed by filtration, and the liquid products were analyzed by using HPLC equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Labora tories), ultraviolet (210 nm) and refractive index (RI) detector. The analysis conditions were set as follows: eluent, 5 mM H2SO4; flow rate, 0.6 mL/min; column temperature, 50 °C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization TEM images of DFNS used as the hard template and the corresponding N-doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages (NCSWCs) in Fig. S1 showed that the size of the obtained NCSWCs was around 200 nm, which is similar to that of DFNS. The diameter of the cage in NCSWCs was approximately 50–60 nm. The calculated BET surface area and pore volume of NCSWCs based on the isotherm in Fig. S2 (a) are 730.2 cm2/g and 0.824 cm3/g, respectively (Table S1). The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution derived from the adsorption branch in Fig. S2 (b) showed that NCSWCs contains dual pores, one was located at around 3.7 nm, the other was in the range of 10–50 nm, which is probably derived from the wrinkled cages. Pd/NCSWCs, PdPt alloy/NCSWCs with different Pd/Pt molar ratios (Pd:Pt = 3:1; 2:1; 1:1; 1:2), and Pt/NCSWCs were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The obtained catalysts were examined by TEM and the results in Fig. 1 (a and b) and Fig. S3 revealed similar particle sizes ranging 5 to 7 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1(c) showed a 0.225 nm lattice spacing corresponding to the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) PdPt alloy, suggesting the formation of alloy nanostructures in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs [27,28]. Similar lattice fringes were also observed on other PdPt alloy/NCSWCs as shown in Fig. S3. The corresponding EDX mapping results in Fig. 1 (d–g) indicated the homogeneous distribution of Pd and Pt elements on PdPt NPs in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs, further confirming the formation of PdPt alloy NPs. In addition, ICP-OES analysis (Table S1) confirmed that the total metal loadings in these catalysts were around 2%, consistent with the theoretical loading. The calculated Pd/Pt molar ratios from ICP-OES and Pd/Pt atomic ratios from XPS were also consistent with the theoretical molar ratios, indicating the effective impregnation of both metal components on NCSWCs. Moreover, it is found in Table S1 that BET surface area and pore volume of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs were not significantly impacted by the impregnation compared to NCSWCs, making it as a representative NCSWCs supported catalyst. The crystal structures of Pd/NCSWCs, PdPt alloy/NCSWCs, and Pt/NCSWCs were analyzed by XRD and shown in Fig. 2 . For Pd/NCSWCs, three peaks at 40.1°, 46.7°, and 68.1° were observed, corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of the fcc crystalline structure of Pd (JCPDS: 46–1043). With the substitution of partial or all Pd atoms with Pt atoms, these peaks gradually shift towards the lower 2θ values. The shift also suggests that the as synthesized PdPt NPs are in an alloy structure and the inclusion of Pt expands the lattice of Pd since the lattice constant of Pt (3.924 Å) is slightly larger than that of Pd(3.891 Å) [29]. Moreover, generally, the tensile strain for Pd in PdPt alloy could cause the upshift of the d band center toward the Fermi level [29]. In addition, as listed in Table S1, the crystallite size for Pd/NCSWCs, Pt/NCSWCs, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs calculated using Scherrer equation ranges from 5.4 to 6.1 nm, which is also in consistence with the above TEM results. High resolution XPS measurements were conducted to analyze chemical states of Pt and Pd. As shown in Fig. S4, two doublets, the major component Pt0 and the minor component Pt2+, can be observed in the Pt 4f spectra of Pt/NCSWCs and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs. Specifically for Pt/NCSWCs, the peaks located at around 71.3 and 74.7 eV were assigned to metallic Pt0, while the peaks appearing at 72.3 and 76.0 eV could be due to Pt2+. With the increase of Pd/Pt molar ratio in PdPt alloy/NCSWCs (from right to left in X-axis), the Pt 4f7/2 peak for metallic Pt0 gradually shifts to the lower binding energy at 71.0 eV in Pd3Pt1/ NCSWCs, as indicated in Fig. 3 (a). Meanwhile, the Pd 3d spectra can also be divided into two double peaks, one attributed to Pd0, the other belonging to Pd2+. With the increase of Pt/Pd molar ratio (from left to right in X-axis), Fig. 3(a) shows that the Pd 3d5/2 peak for metallic Pd0 shifts to a higher binding energy from 335.3 eV for Pd/NCSWCs to 335.7 eV for Pd1Pt2/NCSWCs. The positive shift of Pd and the negative shift of Pt imply the electron transfer from Pd to Pt, which theoretically leads to the upshift of the d band center to the Fermi level. However, it was reported that Pt gains s, p electrons and loses d electrons, while Pd loses s, p electrons but gains d electrons in this electron transfer process, which leads to the downshift of d band center [30,31]. To determine the d band centers for Pd/NCSWCs, Pt/NCSWCs, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs, their valence band spectra (VBS) were measured by high-resolution XPS and their d band centers were obtained by integrating the spectra from −2 to 10 eV after Shirley background correction [32]. It can be observed in Fig. 3(b) that the surface electronic structures of Pd/NCSWCs, Pt/NCSWCs, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs are quite similar and the d band centers determined from VBS, are −2.16 eV and −3.23 eV for Pd and Pt, respectively. Comparing the d band centers obtained experimentally in the previous work for bulk Pd and Pt, which are −2.09 eV and −2.94 eV, and for Pd and Pt NPs, which are −2.02 eV and −2.80 eV, respectively, a good agreement was obtained, confirming the validity of the method used in this work [33,34]. Regarding PdPt alloys/NCSWCs, careful inspection of their VBS reveals that the partial density of states (PDOS) near the Fermi level is decreased with the reduction of Pd/Pt molar ratio in PdPt alloys, which indicates that the d band center tends to downshift along with the decreasing Pd/Pt molar ratio. It is also suggested that the ligand effect can offset the strain effect in PdPt alloy/NCSWCs. To obtain the further insight of the d band centers for Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloys, DFT calculations were performed on Pd108, Pd81Pt27, Pd72Pt36, Pd54Pt54, Pd36Pt72 and Pt108 (The models are shown in Fig. S5 and calculation methods are described in the Supporting Information) [35,36]. As presented in Fig. S6, the calculated d band centers from PDOS for Pd and Pt are −1.84 eV and −2.48 eV, respectively, after alloying Pd with Pt, the PDOS near Fermi level for PdPt alloys exhibits a clearly discernible decrease with an increase in Pt molar ratio. The d band centers are in the order as: Pd81Pt27 (−2.00 eV) >Pd72Pt36 (−2.11 eV) >Pd54Pt54 (−2.22 eV) >Pd36Pt72 (−2.30 eV). Although the calculated d-band centers by DFT are different from the VBS determined values, the d band center trend is in consistence with the experimental results in Fig. 3(b), further confirming the electronic interaction plays a critical role in the d band center of the PdPt alloys. 3.2 Catalytic study for transfer hydrogenation reaction The catalytic performances of various catalysts for transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate/carbonate with GLY are summarized in Table 1 . If the reaction was carried out only with NCSWCs (Entry 1), no products could be detected at 200 °C under 3.0 MPa N2. When Pd/NCSWCs was used as the catalyst (Entry 2), 29.8% of GLY conversion was achieved and the yields of LA and FA were 20.1% and 11.9%, respectively. In contrast, only 21.1% of GLY conversion with 15.2% yield of LA and 7.4% yield of FA could be obtained over Pt/NCSWCs (Entry 3). The turnover frequency (TOF) of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions (TOFLA/TOFFA), were 176.1 h −1/51.3 h −1 for Pd/NCSWCs, and 138.1 h −1/33.4 h −1 for Pt/NCSWCs. The lower catalytic activity of Pt/NCSWCs could be due to the weak Pt catalysts in the hydrogenation of bicarbonate, although it possessed excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of GLY. Pd3Pt1/NCSWCs (Entry 4) shows much better catalytic activity compared with that of Pd/NCSWCs, not only in GLY conversion, but also in LA and FA yields. Moreover, GLY conversion can be further increased to 85.4% over Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs, affording LA and FA with high yields at 67.3% and 56.5%, respectively (Entry 5). In addition, the calculated TOFLA/TOFFA is 606.5 h −1/261.3 h −1. However, with the further increase of Pt composition in PdPt alloy/NCSWCs, the GLY conversion decreased to 74.4% over Pd1Pt1/NCSWCs (Entry 6), and to 55.2% over Pd1Pt2/NCSWCs (Entry 7), the same trend was also observed in the yields of LA and FA, as listed in Table 1. In addition, propylene glycol (PG) was detected as the main byproduct from this transfer hydrogenation reaction. According to the previously proposed mechanism for this reaction that GLY was first dehydrogenated to glyceraldehyde (GLYD), then converted into pyruvaldehyde (PAL) and LA consecutively through the dehydration, keto-enol tautomerization, and intramolecular Cannizzaro reactions, [10] PG was produced from the hydrogenation of PAL. Interestingly, if TOFFA (or TOFLA) was used to represent the catalytic activity, the relationship between the catalytic activity and the VBS determined/DFT calculated d band centers of Pd/NCSWCs, Pt/NCSWCs, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs exhibits a volcano shape with the maximum catalytic activity obtained for Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), indicating that the catalytic activity depends on the d band center relative to the Fermi level. Generally, the d band center is related to the metal-molecule adsorption strength, which shows a volcanic-curve relationship with activity [37,38]. DFT calculations were conducted to investigate reaction pathways to figure out the key factors governing the catalytic activity of PdPt alloy catalysts in this transfer hydrogenation reaction. As shown in Fig. S7, GLY is stably adsorbed on pure Pd (111) and Pt (111) via its O atom, with the Pd-O bond length of 2.475 Å and the Pt-O bond length of 2.286 Å, and their adsorption energies are −0.2642 eV and −0.4155 eV, respectively. When Pd is alloyed with Pt, the O atom of GLY is more favorable adsorbed with the Pt-O bond on the surface of Pd108-mPtm, and their adsorption energies are −0.2825 eV, −0.3031 eV, −0.3569 eV, and −0.3671 eV for Pd81Pt27, Pd72Pt36, Pd54Pt54, and Pd36Pt72, respectively, as listed in Table S2. Subsequently, GLY is dehydrogenated to GLYD and H through the activation of the OH bond and CH bond [39,40]. We also investigated the transition state (TS) reaction of GLY → GLYD + 2H*on the Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloys, as shown in Fig. S8. The TS energies on Pd108 (111) and Pt108 (111) surfaces in Table S2 are 1.1540 eV and 0.3397 eV, respectively, suggesting that pure Pt possessed better catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of GLY to GLYD than that of Pd. Furthermore, according to Table S2 and Fig. 4(b), the adsorption energies of H on the metal surface are in the order as: Pd108 < Pd81Pt27 < Pd72Pt36 < Pd54Pt54 < Pd36Pt72 < Pt108, while the dissociation energies of H are in the order as: Pd108 > Pd81Pt27 > Pd72Pt36 > Pd54Pt54 > Pd36Pt72 > Pt108, which is also in good agreement with the order of d band centers for Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs. The lower the adsorption energy, the harder it is for H species to desorb from the metal surface, and the lower the dissociation energy, the easier it is for H2 to be formed. The TS energies of 2H* → H2 on Pd108 (111) and Pt108 (111) surfaces were also calculated, and the results indicated that the in situ generated H species from GLY on Pt108 (111) were indeed much more favorable to form H2 on Pt108 (111) and high energy was needed to dissociate H species from Pd108 (111). Thus, by adjusting the composition of PdPt alloy catalysts, the adsorption and dissociation energies of H species on metal surface can be balanced, so that the maximum amount of transfer H species can be used for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate. Thus, Pd72Pt36, which has an intermediate ETS (2H → H2), possessed the highest catalytic activity among all the catalysts in this transfer hydrogenation reaction. Carbonate was also used as the hydrogen acceptor in this reaction, and 93.3% of GLY conversion can be achieved with 77.3% yield of LA and 66.7% yield of FA over Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs (Entry 8 in Table 1). Since carbonate cannot be directly hydrogenated to produce FA, [41] the better catalytic results than those from bicarbonate could be attributed to the high initial pH value in the reaction solution.9 Pd2Pt1/NPC was also prepared for comparison, but its catalytic activity was much lower than Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs (Entry 9). In the XRD spectrum (Fig. S10(a)) and TEM images (Fig. S9(a and b)), the crystallite size for Pd2Pt1/NPC are 4.8 nm (based on Scherrer equation) and 4.6 nm, respectively, which are only slightly smaller than that of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs. From the VBS in Fig. S10 (d), the d band center of Pd2Pt1/NPC is −2.54 eV, which is close to the d band center of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs. As a result, the decline in catalytic activity could potentially be attributed to the influence of the catalyst support, where the wrinkled cages in NCSWCs can provide a large storage space and act as a great artificial reactor, facilitating catalytic reactions. The catalytic activity of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-R, prepared by the NaBH4 reduction, was also examined and found to have lower conversion (33.8%) and 21.3% yield of LA and 14.7% yield of FA (Entry 10), slightly higher than that of Pd/NCSWCs. TEM image in Fig. S9 (c and d) shows that the particle size is approximately 3.5 nm in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-R. It was reported previously that the size of metal NPs can directly determine the energy level of the d band center, the smaller the metal particle size, the closer the d band center to the Fermi level [42,43]. From the VBS in Fig. S10 (d), the d band center of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-R is indeed upshifted to −2.19 eV, thus leading to its low catalytic activity. On the other hand, Siddiki, et al. found that Pt catalysts with a larger particle size (5.3 nm) exhibited much higher TOF than Pt catalysts with a smaller particle size (2.8 nm) in the dehydrogenation of GLY to LA because the Pt atoms on flat surfaces have higher activity than those at under-coordinated sites [13]. The same situation was also observed on Ru catalysts for this transfer hydrogenation reaction [10]. The effect of reaction time on transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate with GLY was investigated over Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs. It was found in Fig. 5 (a) that the GLY conversion increased with the reaction time, but the yield of FA decreased from 56.5% at 10 h of reaction time to 55.1% at 12 h. In addition, the effects of reaction temperature were also studied over Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the GLY conversions linearly increase from 20.5% to 90.5% with the elevation of reaction temperature from 140 °C to 220 °C, while the yield of FA drops when the reaction temperature was raised to 220 °C, because high reaction temperature promotes the decomposition of FA. In Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that the conversion of FA greatly increased to around 45–50% at 220 °C, indicating high reaction temperature is unfavored for the formation of FA in this transfer hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, it is highly expected that the molar amount of the produced LA is equal to that of the produced FA in this transfer hydrogenation, in other words, all the H species from the dehydrogenation of GLY could be used for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate, avoiding the hydrogenation of PAL to produce PG. However, as shown in Fig. 5(d), when the molar ratio of GLY to bicarbonate was 1:1, the yield of FA was only 25.7%, likely due to insufficient hydrogen species from GLY for the hydrogenation of bicarbonate. If the concentration of bicarbonate is decreased to 0.5 M (the molar ratio of GLY to bicarbonate is 2:1), the yield of FA increased to 56.5%. When the molar ratio is changed to 4:1, the GLY conversion and yield of LA drastically reduced to 49.6% and 35.3%, respectively, due to the reduced basicity in the reaction system. From these results, 2:1 (1 M/0.5 M) was selected as the optimized molar ratio of GLY/bicarbonate. The catalytic cycling experiments were also conducted on Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs to examine its stability in this transfer hydrogenation reaction. After the each run of the reaction, the catalysts were filtered out, washed with a plenty of deionized water and dried at 110 °C under vacuum overnight. It was found that the GLY conversion and the yields of major products remained almost unchanged in each run (Fig. 6 ). After the cycling experiments, Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs was denoted as Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-S and characterized by various techniques. The contents of Pd and Pt in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-S measured by ICP-OES (Table S1) are almost identical to those in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs, suggesting no leaching of Pd or Pt species into the reaction solution during the consecutive catalytic runs. There were no noticeable changes for the support morphology, particle size and crystal structure in Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs-S compared with those of Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs (Fig. S9 (e and f) and S10 (a)). All these results suggest that Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs possessed excellent catalytic stability. 4 Conclusion In this work, nitrogen doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages supported Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloy catalysts were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation method for transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate with GLY. Structural characterization revealed that Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloy NPs with the size of 5–7 nm are highly dispersed on NCSWCs, which possessed a high surface area and a large pore volume. It was found that electronic perturbation played an important role in deciding the d band centers, the trend for Pd, Pt, and PdPt alloy/NCSWCs is in the order of Pd/NCSWCs > Pd3Pt1/NCSWCs > Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs > Pd1Pt1/NCSWCs > Pd1Pt2/NCSWCs > Pt/NCSWCs. Interestingly, the relationship of the d band center and catalytic activity exhibits a volcano-shape with the highest catalytic activity achieved by Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs, with 85.4% GLY conversion and 67.3% yield of LA and 56.5% yield of FA at 200 °C under 3.0 MPa N2 within 10 h of reaction time. Moreover, when carbonate was used as the substrate, the GLY conversion and yields of products can be further improved. DFT calculations revealed that Pd72Pt36 possessed an intermediate d band center among these catalysts, thus the reaction of 2H → H2 and GLY → GLYD +2H over Pd72Pt36 has moderate transition energy, as a result, maximum amount of the in situ generated H species can be transferred to bicarbonate, leading to its high catalytic activity in this transfer hydrogenation. In addition, Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs exhibited higher catalytic activity than that of Pd2Pt1/NPC, suggesting the wrinkled cages could be beneficial for this transfer hydrogenation reaction. This work demonstrated that this catalytic system provides a possibility to integrate the capture and hydrogenation of CO2 to FA with GLY, a byproduct from biodiesel production.

        "dc:description": "Catalytic transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate, a typical product of CO2 captured in an alkaline solution, with glycerol (GLY) as a hydrogen donor to formate (FA) and lactate (LA) is a sustainable and green approach for simultaneous valorization of CO2 and the major byproduct from biodiesel production. Conventional monometallic noble metal catalysts can catalyze this transfer hydrogenation reaction, but generally required a high reaction temperature, leading to a low yield of FA. In this work, N-doped carbon spheres with wrinkled cages (NCSWCs) supported PdPt alloy catalysts were prepared and their electronic structures were determined by Valence Band Spectra (VBS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). It was found that the relationship between the d band center and catalytic activity exhibits volcano-shaped behaviors, where Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs is on the top of the curve, 85.4% of GLY conversion with 67.3% yield of LA and 56.5% yield of FA can be achieved at 200 °C. DFT calculations also revealed that Pd2Pt1/NCSWCs possessed an intermediate d band center, which tunes the adsorption and dissociation energy of H species on its surface, allowing maximum H transfer during the transfer hydrogenation of bicarbonate, leading to high catalytic activity. Such a d band center catalyst tuning could be efficient way to design new catalysts.",
