D-81730 Miinchen, Germany Received 11 November 1996; received in revised form 24 January 1997; accepted 24 January 1997 Abstract New catalyst preparation methods which avoid the formation of waste water are desirable for environmental reasons, especially in the case of catalysts produced in amounts as large as those in the DeNOx sector. Thermal spreading has recently been applied in the preparation of titania-supported tungsten and molybdenum monolayer catalysts. In this paper we compare catalysts which are prepared via ball milling of mixtures of the individual precursor oxides with subsequent thermal spreading to catalysts which are prepared by a conventional coprecipitation process. Titania (anatase) was milled in the presence of either tungsten trioxide or molybdenum trioxide and these mixtures were subsequently calcined in a stream of oxygen which contained water vapor. After calcination, no crystalline WO3 or MoO3 was detected by XRD or DRIFTS, indicating a good dispersion of the active oxides, The overtones of tungsten and molybdenum oxygen double bond vibrations, which are representative for the formation of surface polyoxo compounds, were detected with DRIFT spectroscopy for samples prepared either by coprecipitation or via ball milling. The intensity distribution of the hydroxyl groups for ball mill prepared samples was different from the distribution for coprecipitated samples. When the physical mixtures were milled for several hours, the anatase was transformed into futile as shown by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, a decrease in surface area and changes in the pore size distribution were observed in correlation with the milling. ~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

[1]) is a widely applied process to remove nitrogen oxides (NO0 from flue gases. Typical catalysts are titania-supported oxides of Vb and VIb elements such as vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten. Structural investigations of these catalysts [2-17] revealed that polyoxo compounds of the active oxides are well-dispersed on the surface of the support. These materials are described as monolayer catalysts. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ~\\, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00050- 1 168 F.C. Jentoft et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 167-182 Impregnation and coprecipitation methods are the predominant preparation procedures for such cata- lysts. The adsorption of volatile precursors with sub- sequent hydrolysis has also been applied for their preparation. These preparation techniques involve large volumes of solutions and suspensions, resulting in waste water which must be disposed of. Thus, an alternative preparation route which avoids an aqueous medium is desirable. Solid-solid wetting has been investigated for sev- eral years as a new pathway for the formation of monolayer catalysts [9,10,18-23]. A recent review by Knfzinger and Taglauer [24] provides information on the theoretical background and a summary of experimental data. In brief, the method involves mix- ing of the support with the active oxides followed by a thermal treatment in an oxidizing environment, often in the presence of water vapor. It has been shown that the active (and mobile) oxides are not only dispersed (thermal spreading) by this technique but also converted into polyoxo compounds. Specifically, the spreading of MoO3 and WO3 and other oxides on different supports such as alumina, titania and silica has been investigated [9,10,15,18-20]. Both active oxides spread on alu- mina and titania when the mixtures of support and active oxide are calcined [ 18-20]. MoO3 was shown to spread on the anatase and the rutile modification of titania [22,25] and WO3 was found to spread on a commercial titania containing both phases [15,26]. The spreading occurs faster with increasing calcina- tion temperature [15]. The presence of water vapor accelerates the process and lowers the spreading tem- perature [15,27], it also leads to more homogeneous products with regard to the dispersion [27]. If water vapor is present during the calcination, the active oxides are transformed into surface polytungstate or polymolybdate species, which are characteristic of the conventionally prepared catalysts [19,20]. A mechanism via surface diffusion in a concentra- tion gradient or via gas phase transport has been excluded [18,19] since the spreading does not occur on silica. Surface (two-dimensional) melting was proposed to be important for the spreading process [24] which is consistent with the fact that the spread- ing temperatures can be correlated with the melting temperatures of the mobile oxides. The surface free energy was discussed as a driving force [21,23,24]. Smaller grain sizes of the mobile oxides showed a positive effect on the spreading process [24]. Hilbrig et al. [15] found that a high surface area WO3 spreads faster on titania than a low surface area WO3. Mestl [27], Leyrer [28] and Polz [29] calcined mixtures of MoO3 and alumina after previous milling and observed facilitated spreading. The surface area of MoO3 increased while it was milled [27], correspond- ing to a smaller particle size. The calcination of mobile oxide/support mixtures which were previously ground in a ball mill resulted in more homogeneous products as compared to samples obtained from unmilled mixtures. Additionally, the spreading took place at a 50 K lower temperature after the mixtures were milled [27]. The milling might not only affect the grain size, it is also known that solid state reactions can result from a tribochemical process [30]. However, the mechanism of the spreading process is not further understood, although positive effects of grinding or milling sam- ples prior to calcination have been demonstrated. Investigations on the use of ball milling in monolayer catalyst preparation have focused on the dispersion of the active oxide and on the formation of the surface polyoxo compound rather than effects on the support. Ball milling has also been applied by Zazhigalov et al. [31] in the preparation of a very different type of catalysts, namely V-P-O catalysts. Suspensions of catalyst powder in ethanol were milled which is being referred to as mechanochemical treatment. Changes in surface area, phase composition and catalytic activity were observed. Rtihle et al. [32] mechanically acti- vated iron oxide, resulting in a different activity and selectivity of the catalyst in Fischer-Tropsch synth- esis. In materials science, ball milling has raised interest as a new low-temperature preparation techni- que [33]. The scope of this work is to investigate; (i) the applicability of ball milling and subsequent thermal spreading to prepare well-defined titania-supported molybdenum and tungsten catalysts; (ii) the compar- ison of these materials with conventionally prepared samples, (using coprecipitation); (iii) the effect of the milling on the properties of the support, especially after a long period of milling. Results from vibrational spectroscopy are complemented by data from X-ray diffraction, surface area and pore size measure- ments. F.C.

Preparation Catalyst powders prepared by a coprecipitation process from metatitanic acid and tungsten or molyb- denum salts, respectively, were provided by Siemens AG KWU KPW, Redwitz, Germany. The composi- tions of the catalysts were 10 wt% WO3]WiO2 with a sulfate content of 2.69 wt%, and 11 wt% MoO3/TiO2 with a sulfate content of 1.6 wt%, The following chemicals were used for the labora- tory preparations: TiO2-DT51 (Rhone-Poulenc, France), pure anatase, 97 m2/g, containing 1.15 wt% SO4- as a major impurity (others may be present at a very low level but were not analyzed); WO3 p.a. and MoO3 p.a. (both Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The composition of the ball mill prepared samples was the same as in the industrial catalyst powders from copre- cipitation. Industrial catalyst powders are denoted TiW and TiMo. Physical mixtures are denoted WO3/TiO2 and MoO3frio2. The milling was performed in a planetary ball mill with an agate container having 300 cm3 volume and six 20 mm diameter agate balls with a weight of approximately 11 g each. The container spins around its own axis and around a second axis outside its center (140 revolutions). Typical initial loads were 15-25 g. Mixtures were stirred for 2 min in a beaker before the powder was placed into the container. The WO3/TiO2 and MoO3FFiO2 samples which were used for calcina- tion were milled for 1 h. Samples of typically 1.5 g were taken after 0.5, 1,2, 5 and 10 h from one batch to study the effect of the milling itself in more detail. Thus, the load of the mill decreased during the experi- ment. Calcination conditions were chosen to be the same as those for the industrial preparation. Tungsten oxide catalysts were calcined at 893 K for 7 h while molybdenum oxide catalysts were calcined 4 h at 823 K. Pure titania was calcined at both 893 K |br 7 h and at 823 K for 4 h. The pure titania and coprecipitated samples were calcined in air in a muffle furnace. The physical mixtures were calcined in a tubular quartz reactor in flowing oxygen. The partial pressure of water vapor was 32 mbar in a 50ml/min oxygen (99.995%, Linde, Germany) stream. X-ray diffraction was performed using a method described by Grbel [34] with a Siemens Guinier diffractometer using Cu K~ excitation (A--0.154 nm). The full widths at half maximum were determined by least-square-fits with Pseudo-Voigt-functions. DRIFT-spectra were recorded with a Bruker IFS 88 FTIR spectrometer, equipped with a Spectratech dif- fuse reflectance cell and an MCT detector. Samples were pretreated at 623 K for 1 h in a 25 ml/min flow of dry nitrogen. These same conditions were used for data acquisition. The accuracy of the temperature was limited by the position of the thermocouple to +20 K. The spectral resolution was 2 cm ~ and the number of scans was typically 1024. BET surface areas and pore size distributions were measured with a Carlo Erba (Fisons Instruments) Sorptomatic 1800. Samples were outgassed for 30 min at 5 10_2 mbar/473 K prior to the adsorption. 3. Results Significant macroscopic heating of the container during the milling was not observed. It should be remarked that the extent of the effect which the milling has on the sample was influenced by the sample weight, i.e., the load of the mill (vide infra), which was a limiting factor in the quantitative comparison of some of the results. Some samples were weakly colored after they were treated in the mill. After 1 h of milling, the WO3/TiO2 mixture was yellowish and after calcination it was colorless. The MoO3/TiO2 mixture was grayish-yellow after 1 h of milling and bluish-green after calcination. After 10 h of milling, the mixtures were blue while pure titania was still colorless. The TiW catalyst was yellowish before and colorless after calcination. The TiMo catalyst was greenish-yellow before and after calcination, and after exposure to daylight it became bluish-gray. 3.1. X-ray diffraction, milled samples The diffractogram of pure titania (as received) consists only of anatase lines (not shown). Fig. 1 gives the diffractograms of the pure anatase titania after (a) 10 and (b) 25 h of milling. The patterns are consistent 170 F.C.

A line broadening of the remaining anatase is observed, i.e., initially the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the line at 20=47.89is 0.51 and after 10 h milling (a) it is 0.56 After 25 h of milling, Fig. 1 (b), the sample is completely converted into rutile as far as can be detected by XRD; thus excluding detection of very small crystals and amorphous material. Fig. 2 presents diffractograms originating from a WO3/TiO2 mixture after (a) 1, (b) 5 and (c) 10 h of milling. The lines of WO3, which are still present after 1 h of milling (a), disappear after long milling times (b), (c). In analogy to pure titania, the pattern of anatase is increasingly replaced by the rutile pattern, and anatase is not detected after 10 h milling (c). The influence of the load is seen from comparison with the pure titania experiment: the initial sample weight was 25 g for TiO2 and 15 g for the WO3/TiO2 mixture, and the transformation proceeds much faster in the latter case (Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 2(c)). An effect by the pres- ence of WO3 on the speed of transformation cannot be excluded though. Similar observations were made for MoO3/TiO2 mixtures: the pattern of MoO3 is not visible after 10 h of milling, and increasing amounts of rutile are recorded with increasing milling time. 3.2. X-ray diffraction, calcined samples The calcination of unmilled titania results in nar- rowing of the lines as shown by the FWHMs in Table 1. The sharpness of the lines increases with EC.

Diffractogram (d) in Fig. 2 was taken from a WO3/ TiO2 sample which was milled for ! h, followed by calcination. The WO3 pattern, which is still present after 1 h milling (Fig. 2(a)), disappears during the thermal treatment and the anatase lines become nar- rower, i.e., from 0.51to 0.40~' at 20=47.89c. Rutile was not detected. The diffractograms of the coprecipitated samples, namely TiW and TiMo, show the pattern of anatase before and after calcination. Neither rutile nor crystal- line WO3 or MoO3 are detected. The FWHMs of the anatase lines after calcination are summarized in Table I. The width of the anatase line at 20=25.24 decreases to 0.42 for TiW and remains constant at 0.58for TiMo. 172 EC.

DRIFT-spectroscopy The overtone regions of M=O stretching vibrations (M=W, Mo) of ball milled and coprecipitated samples are compared in Fig. 3 (M=W) and Fig. 4 (M=Mo). Spectrum (a) in Fig. 3 was recorded from a WO3/TiO2 sample which was milled for 1 h. There are no absorp- tions in the W=O-overtone region. The corresponding spectrum of MoOa/TiO2, given in Fig. 4(a), consists of several bands. The positions of the bands were deter- mined to be 1951, 1918 and 1879cm-t with two shoulders at approximately 1990 and 1970cm-t. The spectra of the mixtures which were milled for 1 h and subsequently calcined are depicted in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4(b). Both spectra are characterized by one broad absorption band which is not present in the spectra of the unmilled mixtures. The band posi- tions are 2007 cm-t for the WO3/TiO2 mixture and 1972 cm-t for the MoO3/TiO2 mixture. The spectra labeled (c) in Figs. 3 and 4 represent the calcined coprecipitated samples. There is no signifi- cant difference in the overtone region as compared to the spectra recorded before calcination. The positions of the absorption maxima after calcination are 2003 and 1965 cm-1 for TiW and TiMo, respectively. The hydroxyl stretching region of titania (as received) is shown in Fig. 5(a). The spectrum is also representative for the 1 h milled WO3/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures before calcination. An intense absorption at 3670 cm-t is accompanied by shoulders F.C.

A different spectrum is obtained from a 10 h milled WO3FFiO2 mixture (b), corresponding to the X-ray diffractogram in Fig. 2(c). An additional band is observed at 3734cm~ besides a broad absorption around 3650 cm l The calcined milled mixtures gave the spectra (c) (WO3]TiO2) and (d) (MoO3/TiO2) in Fig. 5. The intensity distribution of the hydroxyl bands changes and the band at 3670 cm ~ is no longer dominant. At least three bands can be distinguished in the spectrum of the calcined WO3lTiO2 in Fig. 5(c), with positions at approx. 3680, 3655 and 3610 cm-1. The spectrum of calcined MoO3/TiO2 in Fig. 5(d) lacks the high frequency shoulder on the 3670 cm-I band. Spectra (e) and (f) in Fig. 5 were recorded from calcined TiW and TiMo, i.e., samples from coprecipitation. The OH- region of TiW and TiMo was only slightly affected by calcination; thus, the spectra in the uncalcined state are not shown. The spectra of both samples show two weak bands at around 3690 and 3655 cm i. The intensity distribution of the hydroxyl bands of the coprecipitated samples (Fig. 5(e) and (f)) differs clearly from the pattern in the spectra of the calcined physical mixtures (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). 3.4. Surface area and pore size distribution The BET surface area of WO3 is 18 m2/g, and the surface area of MoO3 is below 5 m2/g. The surface area of pure titania is correlated with the milling time in Fig. 6; the corresponding values are listed in Table 2. The surface area remains close to 90 mZ/g during an induction period of about 5 h, followed by a decrease to 31 mZ/g after 25 h. The surface areas of the WO3/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures increase slightly within the first hour of milling and decrease to 80 and 84 m2/g, respectively, after 10 h (see Table 2). Surface areas after calcination are given in Table 3. The surface area of pure unmilled titania decreases from 97 to 79 m2/g after calcination at 823 K, and to 55 m2/g after calcination at 893 K. The calcination of the 1 h milled WO3fI'iO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures yields surface areas of 52 and 66 m2/g, respectively. The surface areas of calcined TiW and TiMo were determined to be 69 and 88 m2/g, respectively. The pore size distributions are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The features at small radii are artifacts.

The pore size distribution of titania does not reveal any prominent peaks after 25 h of milling, Fig. 7(d). The typical radius of the pores in pure titania shifts duringcalcination from 40 to 46 ~, (4 h/823 K) and to 75 A (7 h/893 K) as depicted in Fig. 7(b) and (c), respectively. The pore size distribution of the ball milled mix- tures is broader after 1 h milling as shown for WO3/ TiO2 in Fig. 8(a), which is representative also for MoO3/TiO2. The pore size distribution of the 1 h milled and subsequently calcined samples, i.e., cal- cined WO3/TiO2 in Fig. 8(b) (representative also for MoO3/TiO2), does not have specific features but appears to have an increased fraction of larger pores. The pore size distributions in Fig. 8(c) and (d) were recorded from TiW and TiMo after calcination. The centers of the maxima are located at 59 ,~ (TiW) and 33 A (TiMo), and can be compared to maxima at 40 ,~ (TiW) and 30 ,~ (TiMo) in the uncalcined samples (not shown). 4. Discussion 4.1. Anatase-rutile-phase transformation The brookit and anatase modifications of titania both transform into rutile, the most common form of titania, before they melt [35]. The anatase-rutile transformation is undesirable in the field of catalysis because it is usually accompanied by a severe decrease EC.

Typically, the transition is thermally induced. Above 1003 K, the transformation of anatase into rutile occurs very fast, while below 883 K the rate of transformation is negligibly small [36]. However, it was also found that some oxides undergo a phase change when they are milled. This phenomenon has not only been observed for titania [37,38], but also for alumina [39] and zirconia [40,41]. It is not yet understood how the phase transition is initiated by the milling. Local heating effects have been proposed as a cause for the transformation [24]. Other authors [38] claim that the pressure on the material, produced by the balls in the mill, may be the dominating factor. This theory is supported by the observation of an intermediate, high-pressure modifi- cation of TiO2 [38]. The smaller average particle size achieved during the milling process may also affect the phase transition. Garvie [42] has inferred that the metastable tetragonal zirconia exists in a certain range of particle sizes where the surface free energy is lower compared to the stable monoclinic phase. This hypoth- esis may also be applicable to materials other than zirconia. The stability of the anatase is influenced by several parameters. The transition temperature was found to depend on the method of synthesis, the surrounding atmosphere, and the presence of foreign ions [43]. The latter are either intentionally added or impurities, and they can be in the bulk or on the surface. Foreign ions are often introduced in an industrial synthesis, e.g. in the sulfate or the chloride process for the preparation of titania. 176 EC.

The atmosphere (e.g. hydrogen, oxygen, vacuum) and the foreign cations in the lattice determine the density of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies increase the mobility of the ions and thus facilitate the transformation, since the mechanism of the transi- tion from anatase to rutile can be described as a cooperative movement of titanium and oxygen ions [43]. Cations of higher valence than Ti4+ decrease the number of oxygen vacancies (resulting in stabilization of the metastable phase) while lower valence cations increase their density (resulting in destabilization) [43]. Another effect of incorporated foreign cations is a distortion of the oxygen environment because the ions favor a coordination other than the octahedral of Wi4+ in anatase, as is the case for V5+ [44]. Vanadium is an exception to the higher valence ion effect mentioned previously in that it destabilizes anatase [45]. At the surface, impurities may decrease the mobility of the ions and, therefore, inhibit the transformation as dis- cussed by Criado et al. [46]. Sulfate, which is present in all the samples in our investigation, can have a bifunctional effect which is the incorporation of S6+ into the lattice [43] but also the adsorption of SO3/SO42- on the surface. SO]- and PO43- are usually considered to be stabilizing agents [37,47-49], however, Sullivan and Coleman [50] could not find any correlation between the concentration of SO3 and rutile forma- tion. W6+ is an example of a cation which fits well into the anatase lattice because it prefers octahedral coor- dination and has a similar ionic radius to that of Ti4+ [51]. W6+ is, therefore, a stabilizing ion [44] when present in the bulk. The transition temperature of anatase with tungstates at the surface was 200 K higher than the transition temperature of pure anatase [15]. The effect of MoO3 is not clear [14,52] although Mo6+ is a higher valence cation. Furthermore, some impurities such as sulfate may be volatile, and their concentration may decrease when the sample is heated. It is not known whether impurities stabilize a metastable phase also with respect to a transition initiated by milling. Sulfate, tungsten and molybde- num are candidates for the stabilization of the anatase. Possible scenarios are the dispersion of the active oxides on the titania surface, leading to a decreased mobility of surface ions, or the incorporation of tungsten and molybdenum ions into the lattice of the titania through a solid state reaction. 4.2. Effect of ball milling on phase composition It has been observed here that milling results in a phase transformation of anatase into rutile, which is consistent with previous observations [37,38]. The transformation occurs for pure titania as well as for WO3/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures. At the same time, the anatase lines broaden during the milling process. Possible reasons for line broadening are (i) a decreasing particle size and (ii) an increase in lattice strain. Milling does not only affect the support but also EC. Jentoft et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 16l (1997) 167-182 177 the active oxides. When samples are milled for a long period of time, the WO3 and MoO3 reflections in the diffractogram disappear. These results are consistent with observations by Hilbrig [15], who found an amorphization of WO3 when it was milled in a mixture with titania. The line broadening which is detected in the case of MoO3 has been attributed to smaller grain sizes by Mestl et al. [27], and not to strain in the crystals. Hence, through ball milling, anatase is trans- formed into rutile, and apparently the particle size of all components decreases. After 1 h when the WO3/ TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures are taken for calcina- tion, no rutile was detected. The presence of small rutile nuclei, escaping the detection by XRD, cannot be excluded. 4.3. DRIFT-spectroscopy of titania-supported tungsten and molybdenum catalysts DRIFT-spectroscopy gives information on hydroxyl groups of the support, how they are affected when an active species is anchored to the surface, and on the structure of the surface active species itself. Titania has several absorptions in the hydroxyl regime. The literature data are neither consistent for anatase nor for rutile. In the case of anatase, mostly two bands at 3665-3675cm-L and ca. 3720- 3725 cm ~ are documented [53-56]. Additionally, bands at ca. 3640 cm-I [53,54] and 3715 cm-l are frequently reported [54,57]. Absorptions at 3735 [58], 3680-3690 [15,59,60], 3650-3660 [57,59,60] and 3410-3420cm-1 [57,59] have been assigned to rutile. The existence of W-OH and Mo-OH groups which terminate surface species have been discussed [13,16,17,61,62]. They are expected in the same fre- quency range as Ti-OH groups and, therefore, these species are difficult to distinguish from each other [16]. Absorptions which have increasing intensity with increasing molybdenum concentration have been interpreted as molybdenum hydroxyl groups [ 17]. The opposite effect, namely, a decreasing intensity of certain hydroxyls with increasing loading, was observed for tungsten trioxide supported on titania [ 15]. Hence, the bands were assigned to titania hydro- xyl groups. The overtone of the M=O (M---W, Mo) stretching mode in the range 1900-2100 cm-I is a probe for the formation of surface polyoxo compounds [2,16,17]. Anatase and WO3 do not have absorptions in the range 1800-2200 cm- l; the WO3 structure does not exhibit terminal tungsten oxygen bonds. The layer structure of MoO3 involves Mo=O units [63] which lead to bands at 1950, 1918 and 1879 cm-I with two shoulders at approx. 1993 and 1973 cm-1 (this work). The over- tone of the W=O stretching vibration of polytungstates on TiO2 surfaces is found at 2000-2008 cm- l [2]. An increasing tungsten loading causes a shift to increas- ing wave numbers (2008 cm-1) which is probably due to a higher degree of condensation. The position of the band is also sensitive to the presence of adsorbed water which shifts the band from 2020 to 1950 cm-I [16]. Similar observations are made for polymolybdates on titania [17]. In water vapor con- taining atmosphere, the Mo=O overtone is detected at 1900 cm- 1, and after evacuation at 673 K it is detected at 1985 cm i. A high loading gives MoO3-1ike fea- tures in the spectrum. 4.4. Effect of ball milling, DRIFT-spectroscopy No significant changes are observed in the DRIFT spectra when the mixtures are milled for only 1 h. The spectrum of the WO3/TiO2 mixture is similar to the spectrum of anatase in the recorded range, and the spectrum of the MoO3/TiO2 mixture is qualitatively a superposition of the spectra of anatase and crystalline MoO3. There is no evidence for the formation of a surface species with M=O (M--W, Mo) groups or M- OH groups, or for the formation of rutile which is in agreement with the results from XRD. According to the diffractograms (Fig. 2(c)), milling of a WO3/TiO2 mixture for 10 h results in complete transformation of the titania support into rutile. The corresponding DRIFT spectrum (Fig. 5(b)) has one strong band at 3734 cm 1 which is not present in the initial anatase spectra and is, therefore, assigned to rutile [58]. A second band at ca. 3650 cm-l is not unambiguously assignable to either anatase or rutile. Hence, the presence of some remaining anatase which is not detected with XRD, cannot be excluded, even after 10 h of milling. The structure of the tungsten species in these samples remains unresolved, since there is neither an indication for a polytungstate species in the DRIFT spectra nor is the tungsten trioxide pattern present in the X-ray diffractograms. 178 F.C. Jentoft et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 167-182 4.5. Effect of ball milling on surface area Pure titania shows a considerable loss of surface area while being milled (Fig. 6) which is consistent with the observed transformation into rutile (Fig. 1). But the anatase lines in the XRD pattern are broa- dened, indicating decreasing particle sizes, which should result in a larger surface area. Thus, two opposing effects are competing, and it is not easily possible to assign the individual contributions of anatase, rutile, and maybe an X-ray amorphous frac- tion to the total surface area of titania. Similarly, the surface areas of the mixtures are influenced by several factors, i.e., (i) transformation of the titania from anatase into rutile, (ii) smaller grain sizes of the remaining anatase fraction, and (iii) contributions of the active oxides. The diffraction patterns of WO3 and MoO3 disappear when the mixtures are milled for a long period of time. The effect is likely correlated to a decrease in particle size which would result in an increase in surface area. This interpretation is con- sistent with data reported by Mestl et al. [27], who milled pure MOO3. Mestl observed a steep increase in surface area up to ca. 30 m2/g after an induction period of approximately 1 h of milling. However, the effect of the milling on the surface areas of titania and the active oxides is small after only 1 h of milling, and a series of experiments would be required for a quantitative interpretation of the surface area of the mixtures. 4.6. Effect of ball milling on pore size distribution The prominent peak at 40 ,~ in the pore size dis- tribution of titania (Fig. 7(a)) disappears completely after 25 h of milling (Fig. 7(d)). The pore size dis- tributions of the WO3/TiO2 (Fig. 8(a)) and MOO3/ TiO2 mixtures are strongly perturbed already after 1 h of milling, as compared to the pore size distribu- tion of pure titania (Fig. 7(a)) which is representative for the unmilled mixtures. Since the promoter oxides do not significantly contribute to the pores, the pore size distribution mirrors the titania fraction of the sample. In a simple model, pores are formed by agglomerates of crystals which have an interstitial space that corresponds to the pore size distribution. The milling obviously affects the structure of these agglomerates. The changes of the pore structure are not accompanied by a change of surface area as long as the milling time is short, and a measurable formation of rutile has not yet occurred. A possible explanation within the simple model presented could be that the agglomerates which form the pores are broken into their parts, i.e., crystallites. A similar conclusion was drawn by Mestl et al. (1995a) in [27] from data which were obtained after the milling of MOO3, i.e., initially the agglomerates are affected and not the crystallites, 4. 7. Effect of calcination on support structure and morphology The calcination temperatures are below values at which an anatase-rutile transformation occurs with a considerable rate; and stabilizing sulfate is present, at least prior to calcination (vide infra). Thus, changes in the phase composition of the titania as a result of calcination are not expected. The XRD data obtained after calcination of titania samples, the 1 h ball milled WO3/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures, and the copre- cipitated samples, are consistent with this expectation; no rutile is detected. The absence of rutile in the calcined ball milled mixtures might be an indication that after 1 h of milling no ruffle had formed since nuclei would be expected to grow during calcination and then become detectable. The line narrowing, which is observed after calci- nation for all samples, namely pure titania, ball mill and conventionally prepared samples, indicates recrystallization of the anatase support. It is known from electron microscopy of pure titania [64] that the anatase surface is smoothened during calcination. The grain surfaces are rough before calcination, and char- acterized by 5-35 ,~ microfacet ledges. After calcina- tion, larger facet planes of approx. 120-210 ,~ are observed. The average grain size after calcination is 30-50 ,~ as compared to 20-30 A before calcination [64]. The much smoother surface explains the decrease of surface strain, leading to narrower lines in the diffractograms. The smooth surface and larger grains also account for the loss of surface area observed in titania (Table 3). The particle growth could be related to the formation of larger pores (Fig. 7(a)-(c)) during calcination. Agglomerates formed out of larger particles would naturally have a larger interstitial space. The tendency to form larger E C. Jentoft et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 167-182 179 pores with increasing temperature has also been described for zirconia [65]. The shift towards larger pores increases with calcination temperature and dura- tion, which is consistent with the line narrowing observed in the diffractograms (Table 1) and with decreasing surface area (Table 3). The anatase lines of the calcined coprecipitated samples, namely TiW and TiMo, are broader than those of pure titania (Table 1). The presence of tung- state or molybdate, may result in a lower mobility of surface atoms as discussed for the presence of sulfate or phosphate groups. TEM pictures support this hypothesis by showing that the ragged surface of pure titania becomes smooth during calcination, while the disordered surface structure is conserved when titania- supported tungstate samples prepared from copreci- pitation are calcined I64]. The observation corre- sponds to the fact that line widths and surface areas undergo smaller changes during calcination in the presence of tungstate and molybdate (i.e., samples TiW and TiMo) on the surface as compared to pure titania. A volatilization of sulfate, tungstate, or molyb- date is not observed below 973 K for TiW and TiMo by DTG/TG-MS. However, the analysis of TiW after calcination for 7 h at 893 K gives a sulfate content of only 0.69 wt. These results are not necessarily con- tradictory since in the thermoanalytical experiment the sample was heated with a higher rate than during calcination and was kept at a high temperature for a shorter time than during calcination. The differences in line widths and surface area between the calcined TiW and TiMo samples arise from the different calci- nation conditions. Higher temperature and longer duration result in narrower lines for TiW than for TiMo, these results are consistent with what is observed for pure titania. Water vapor which was present during calcination of the ball milled mixtures is known to influence the sintering rate. The sintering rates of titania [66], zirconia [67] and alumina [68] increase in the presence of water vapor. On the other hand, fast spreading of WO3 and MoO3 with formation of a surface species could prevent sintering by reducing the mobility of surface atoms as described above. The surface area loss of the mixtures is higher than that of titania and the coprecipitated samples when calcined under the same conditions (Table 3); thus, the recrystallization has to proceed with a higher rate than the spreading. Consistently, electron microscopy data show a reason- able dispersion for ball milled WO3/TiO2 mixtures only after 9 h of calcination [64]. The pore size distribution, which is altered by the milling process, does not change considerably during the thermal treatment. Hence, the catalysts from ball mill preparation and coprecipitation differ signifi- cantly in their pore size distribution. While the sam- ples from coprecipitation are characterized by a defined maximum the ball mill prepared systems lack prominent features. 4.8. Effect of calcination on su~'ace species The absence of the WO3 pattern in the diffracto- gram of the calcined WO3/TiO2 mixture suggests that the oxide is well dispersed. Likewise, the features of MoO3 are not detected anymore in the DRIFT spec- trum of the calcined MoO3friO2 mixture. The pre- sence of the overtone bands at 2007 cm 1 (W=O) and 1972 cm-~ (Mo=O), respectively, indicate the forma- tion of surface polytungstate and polymolybdate. These data are consistent with the literature [2,16,17] and spectra are comparable with the results obtained for conventionally prepared catalysts (Fig. 3(b) and (c), 4(b) and (c)). The band positions are close, and a significant difference in the spectra arises only from the background which increases considerably towards lower wave numbers in the case of samples prepared by coprecipitation; an effect which is not understood yet. 4.9. Effect of calcination on dispersion Neither WO3 nor MoO3 are detected (XRD, DRIFT) after calcination in any of the samples, but the corresponding polyoxo species (DRIFT) are detected. When the hydroxyl regions of the DRIFT spectra before and after calcination are compared, differences in relative and, apparently, overall inten- sities are observed. However, since some experimental parameters and the reflectivity of the different samples may not be the same, true quantitative statements are not possible. The calcined milled WO3/TiO2 and MoO3/TiO2 mixtures have features which differ sig- nificantly from calcined pure titania. The decrease in intensity suggests that Ti-OH groups are consumed to anchor the polyoxo species on the surface. The spec- 180 EC. Jentoft et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 167--182 trum of the calcined WO3/TiO2 mixture shows at least three bands, while the spectrum of the MoO3/TiO2 mixture lacks the contributions at high wave numbers (3680 cm-l). The spectra of TiWand TiMo are similar to each other, but the samples clearly differ from the calcined physical mixtures. The differences can be explained by the preferred reaction of certain OH- groups [8,13] when the surface species is formed and anchored to the support. Presumably, the reaction of the OH-groups occurs during the coprecipitation step in the case of a wet preparation, and during calcination when the solid-solid-wetting technique is used. The chemistry in a coprecipitation process involves reac- tants such as solvated tungstates and molybdates, and a charged surface which depends on the pH of the aqueous medium. The intermediates in the thermal spreading process are unknown. The different types of OH-groups observed in the spectra of ball mill prepared and coprecipitated samples, respectively, may indicate different mechanisms for the forma- tion of the surface species in the two preparation techniques. On the other hand, apparently similar molybdate and tungstate surface species are formed from both preparations, though DRIFT spectroscopy may not be able to distinguish subtle structure differ- ences. tantly, a severe decrease in surface area was observed. Therefore, the milling has to be performed in a way to prevent these undesirable effects. In principle, the active oxide could be milled separately from the support to obtain smaller grain sizes as they are desired to facilitate the spreading process. However, in this case an intimate mixture of the active oxide with the support cannot be achieved. A shorter, more gentle milling procedure including the support may not lead to the desired effect on the particle size of the active oxide. Additionally, the milled samples under- went a greater loss of surface area during calcination as compared to coprecipitated samples. (iv) Milling alters the pore size distribution in such a way that there is no characteristic maximum. It is not yet known how the catalytic properties of these types of samples are affected. Data on the catalytic performance of ball mill prepared samples are lacking. Still, the combination of ball milling and thermal spreading has been proven to be a potential technique for the preparation of monolayers although the milling parameters need optimization. Acknowledgements 5. Conclusions (i) Consistent with the literature, thermal spreading of WO3 and MoO3 on titania (anatase) occurs when physical mixtures which have been milled in a pla- netary ball mill for 1 h are calcined. (ii) The formation of a polyoxo tungstate and a polyoxo molybdate was detected. This is expected when the calcination of such physical mixtures is conducted in the presence of water vapor. The M=O (M=W, Mo) overtones in the DRIFF spectra did not show major differences between the ball mill prepared samples and conventionally prepared sam- ples from coprecipitation. However, differences in the patterns in the hydroxyl region suggest that the surface species on ball milled samples anchor at different sites or exchange different OH-groups as compared to coprecipitated samples.

Present address: Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Abteilung Anorganische Chemie, Faradayweg 4-6, D-14195 Berlin (Dahlem), Germany. New catalyst preparation methods which avoid the formation of waste water are desirable for environmental reasons, especially in the case of catalysts produced in amounts as large as those in the DeNO x sector. Thermal spreading has recently been applied in the preparation of titania-supported tungsten and molybdenum monolayer catalysts. In this paper we compare catalysts which are prepared via ball milling of mixtures of the individual precursor oxides with subsequent thermal spreading to catalysts which are prepared by a conventional coprecipitation process. Titania (anatase) was milled in the presence of either tungsten trioxide or molybdenum trioxide and these mixtures were subsequently calcined in a stream of oxygen which contained water vapor. After calcination, no crystalline WO3 or MoO3 was detected by XRD or DRIFTS, indicating a good dispersion of the active oxides. The overtones of tungsten and molybdenum oxygen double bond vibrations, which are representative for the formation of surface polyoxo compounds, were detected with DRIFT spectroscopy for samples prepared either by coprecipitation or via ball milling. The intensity distribution of the hydroxyl groups for ball mill prepared samples was different from the distribution for coprecipitated samples. When the physical mixtures were milled for several hours, the anatase was transformed into rutile as shown by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, a decrease in surface area and changes in the pore size distribution were observed in correlation with the milling.
