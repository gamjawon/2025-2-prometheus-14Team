DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60405-1 ARTICLE Reforming and Hydrogenolysis of Glycerol over Ni/ZnO Catalysts Prepared by Different Methods HU Jiye, LIU Xiaoyu, WANG Bin, PEI Yan, QIAO Minghua*, FAN Kangnian Department of Chemistry and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China Abstract: The catalytic conversion of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) is generally conducted batch-wise in an autoclave in the presence of high pressure H 2 . The reforming and hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO over Ni/ZnO catalysts in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor without added H 2 was reported. The Ni/ZnO catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation (WI), co-precipitation (CP), hydrothermal treatment (HT), and carbon microsphere hard-templating (CT) methods. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and H 2 titration. At a low weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of glycerol, the 1,2-PDO produced got degraded to ethanol and gas phase products over catalysts with high Ni dispersion, while at a high WHSV, the selectivity for 1,2-PDO was limited by the hydrogenation of the acetol intermediate. At the optimized WHSV, the catalyst with a higher Ni dispersion was more selective for 1,2-PDO, and over the Ni/ZnO catalyst with the highest Ni dispersion, the highest selectivity of 54.9% for 1,2-PDO was obtained at a glycerol conversion of 85.4% at the WHSV of 0.84 h â€“1 . Key words: nickel; zinc oxide; glycerol; reforming; hydrogenolysis; 1,2-propanediol; dispersion degree Due to the non-sustainability of fossil fuels, researchers have turned to renewable resources [1,2], of which the production of biodiesel from oil and fats by transesterification with alcohol is representative [3,4]. Generally, the production of ten tons of biodiesel will yield one ton of glycerol as byproduct [5]. Thus, the transformation of glycerol to valuable commodity chemi- cals has attracted considerable attention. For example, re- searchers have developed various heterogeneous catalytic routes such as dehydration to acrolein [6], partial oxidation to dihydroxypropanone [7,8], aqueous-phase reforming (APR) to H 2 [9â€“11], and hydrogenolysis to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO)/1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) [12â€“15]. 1,2-PDO is a chemical with wide applications in daily life, pharmaceutical, and chemical synthesis processes. Currently, 1,2-PDO is mainly produced by the petrochemical route through the hy- dration of propylene oxide [1]. It is evident that the transfor- mation of biomass-derived glycerol to 1,2-PDO is more sus- tainable. The hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO is mainly cata- lyzed by Cu or Ru-based catalysts. Yuan et al. [13] reported that the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity for 1,2-PDO both exceeded 90% over a Cu 0.4 /Mg 5.6 Al 2 O 8.6 -CP catalyst with the aid of NaOH. Ru-based catalysts exhibit higher activity than Cu-based catalysts, but since Ru tends to break the Câ€“C bond, they lead to lower 1,2-PDO selectivity. Feng et al. [14] found that as compared to Ru on other supports, Ru supported on TiO 2 showed the highest activity, but the selectivity for 1,2-PDO was only about 50%. By mixing LiOH with Ru/TiO 2 , the conversion of glycerol and selectivity for 1,2-PDO reached 89.6% and 86.8%, respectively [15]. In the literature, the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO is usually conducted under a relatively high H 2 pressure (5â€“8 MPa) [16,17], which imposes high demands on reactor mate- rials and operation safety. Also, using H 2 increases the pro- duction cost. Dâ€™Hondlt et al. [18] first reported that glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO can be achieved without added H 2 through a combined APR-hydrogenolysis strategy. Over a catalyst with reforming ability, H 2 generated in the APR proc- HU Jiye et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1266â€“1275 ess (Reaction 1 in Scheme 1) serves as an in situ hydrogen source for the subsequent hydrogenolysis reactions (Reactions 2 and 3 in Scheme 1). Ideally, seven H 2 molecules are generated by the APR of one glycerol molecule [9], and these H 2 mole- cules hydrogenolyze seven glycerol molecules to seven 1,2-PDO molecules. The highest theoretical selectivity for 1,2-PDO is 87.5% in this reaction scheme [18]. This strategy has been validated in several published papers [19â€“22]. For example, Roy et al. [20] obtained glycerol conversion of 50.1% and 1,2-PDO selectivity of 47.2% over physically mixed Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Ru/Al 2 O 3 (mass ratio of 1:1) catalysts under a N 2 atmosphere. Gandarias et al. [21] reported a 1,2-PDO selec- tivity of 35.3% at a glycerol conversion of 26.6% over Si-Al mixed oxides-supported Pt catalyst under a N 2 atmosphere. The advantages of APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO include (1) no need for external H 2 , thus improving reactor safety, and (2) the system pressure is low, thus cutting down on reactor cost and improving operational safety [20]. However, almost all catalysts reported so far for APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO are precious metals, and there is much room for the improvement of the selectivity to 1,2-PDO [20â€“22]. Non-precious metal Ni has both APR and hydrogenolysis activities, but Ni-based catalysts have rarely been explored [19]. In this work, we prepared Ni/ZnO catalysts by different methods and used them for the APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO. Our results showed that these catalysts can convert glycerol to 1,2-PDO effectively in the absence of added H 2 . The effect of the preparation method on the selectivity for 1,2-PDO is discussed. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni/ZnO catalysts were prepared by wetness impregna- tion (WI), co-precipitation (CP), hydrothermal treatment (HT), and carbon microsphere-templating (CT) methods. WI method. First, 1.556 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water at room temperature. Then, 1.790 g of ZnO was added into the solution. The preparation process of ZnO was similar to the CP method described below but without a nickel salt. After it was homogeneously mixed, the mixture was dried in a water bath at 333 K. The solids were dried at 373 K overnight and calcined at 773 K for 4 h with heating at a heating rate of 2 K/min. This sample was denoted as NiO/ZnO-WI. After reduction, the catalyst was denoted as Ni/ZnO-WI. CP method. The preparation was based on the method de- scribed by Ryzhikov et al. [23]. First, 1.556 g of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O and 6.576 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 Â·6H 2 O were dissolved in 137.5 ml of deionized water at room temperature. The mixed solution was maintained in a water bath at 333 K under vig- orous stirring. Then, 60 ml of 0.5 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 solution (ca. 10% alkali excess) was added into the mixed solution by a peristaltic pump at a speed of 2 ml/min. The resulting suspen- sion was aged in the water bath for another 4 h under vigorous stirring. The precipitate was washed by deionized water six times to remove residual base and Na + ions, using 300 ml of deionized water for each washing. Finally, the precipitate was dried at 373 K overnight and calcined at 773 K for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 K/min. This sample was denoted as NiO/ZnO-CP, and the reduced catalyst was denoted as Ni/ZnO-CP. HT method. The precipitation and aging processes were the same as in the CP method. The aged precipitate was transferred into a 250 ml autoclave for a hydrothermal treatment at 373 K for 24 h. The subsequent washing and calcination processes were also the same as the CP method. This sample was denoted as NiO/ZnO-HT, and the reduced catalyst was denoted as Ni/ZnO-HT. CT method. Carbon microspheres were prepared using the method in Ref. [24]. First, 0.5 g carbon microspheres were added into a Ni(NO 3 ) 2 and Zn(NO 3 ) 2 mixed solution obtained as described in the CP method. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h. The successive preparation steps were the same as in the HT method. This sample was denoted as NiO/ZnO-CT, and the reduced catalyst was denoted as Ni/ZnO-CT. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The bulk composition was determined by inductively cou- pled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, IRIS Intrepid). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (A BET ) and porosity were measured by N 2 adsorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics TriStar3000 apparatus. Prior to the measure- ment, the samples were degassed at 473 K for 2 h under flowing N 2 atmosphere. Room temperature H 2 titration was conducted to determine Ni surface area (A act. ). The amount of chemisorbed H 2 was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). H/Ni stoichiometry of 1 and a surface atom density of 1.54 Ã— 10 19 Ni atom/m 2 were assumed. The average Ni particle size was estimated using the hemisphere model. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG, TGA7) at a heating rate of 10 K/min was employed to investigate the thermal decomposition behavior of the precursor of NiO/ZnO-CT in air. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Bruker AXS D8 Ad- vance X-ray diffractometer using Cu K Ä® radiation (Èœ = 0.15418 - H 2 O O OH OH OH HO OH OH A P R (Reaction 2) (Reaction 3) (Reaction 1) hydrogenation CO 2 + H 2 Scheme 1.

Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out on a homemade apparatus to determine the reduction behavior. Prior to reduction, the sample was degassed at 673 K for 2 h under Ar. After cooling to room temperature, the gas was switched to 5% H 2 -95% Ar at a flow rate of 30 ml/min, and the sample was heated to 873 K at a rate of 20 K/min. The amount of H 2 consumed was monitored by a TCD. The morphology was observed with a JEOL JEM2011 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV. 200 Ni particles were randomly selected for each catalyst to determine the particle size distribution. 1.3 Activity testing The reaction was conducted on a continuous flow fixed-bed tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm. Catalyst (0.5 g, 60â€“80 mesh) was held in the isothermal section of the reactor by quartz powder and reduced by 5% H 2 -95% Ar at 673 K for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 K/min. After the catalyst was cooled to room temperature under the reducing atmosphere, the reac- tor temperature was raised to 508 K and the system pressure was regulated by Ar to 3.1 MPa. An aqueous solution con- taining 10 wt% glycerol was pumped into the reactor from the bottom. The feed rate of this was varied to get the desired weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, weight of glycerol per weight of catalyst per hour). After gas-liquid separation, the gas phase product was analyzed online by a GC102M gas chromatograph. H 2 and CO 2 were separated by a 5 Ã… molecular sieve packed column and measured by a TCD. Light alkanes were separated by a Porapak R packed column and measured by a flame ionization detector (FID). Glycerol and liquid phase products were separated by a CP-Wax 52 CB capillary column (30 m Ã— 0.25 mm Ã— 0.25 È�m) and analyzed on a GC9560 gas chromatograph with a FID. Blank tests indicated that the stainless steel reactor had no catalytic activity. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization results Table 1 compiles the physicochemical properties of the Ni/ZnO catalysts prepared by different methods. The actual Ni loadings on these catalysts were very close to the nominal value of 17.5 wt%. N 2 physisorption results showed that A BET and pore volume increased in the order of Ni/ZnO-WI < Ni/ZnO-CP < Ni/ZnO-HT < Ni/ZnO-CT. Based on the H 2 titration results, the corresponding A act. values were 2.8, 4.4, 6.5, and 7.0 m 2 /g Ni , and the dispersions of Ni were 4.1%, 6.6%, 9.6%, and 10.4%, respectively. The hemisphere model gave average Ni particle sizes of 25.4, 15.3, 10.5, and 9.6 nm for these catalysts, which agreed well with the following TEM results. As compared to the WI method, the CP method re- markably improved the Ni dispersion. Ni became more dis- persed by the hydrothermal treatment of the aged precipitate. Employing carbon microspheres as the template further im- proved Ni dispersion to some extent. Figure 1 presents the TG curves of the NiO/ZnO-CT sample before calcination. In the differential thermogravimetric (DTG) curve, there were three mass loss processes in the temperature range of 350 to 1000 K. The peaks at 375, 635, and 690 K were assigned to the desorption of physically adsorbed H 2 O, thermal decomposition of the metal carbonates, and oxidative decom- position of the carbon microspheres [24], respectively. The mass losses due to metal carbonates and carbon microspheres were 28.5% and 5.9%, respectively, which agreed well with the nominal values. This characterization revealed that calcination at 773 K was enough for the complete decomposition of the metal carbonates. Furthermore, it can be inferred that during the calcination process, the metal carbonates were decomposed first to the corresponding metal oxides, followed by the de- composition of the carbon microspheres in the sample, thus increasing the A BET and Ni dispersion of the Ni/ZnO-CT cata- lyst.

HU Jiye et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1266â€“1275 maximum showed that the reducibility increased in the order of NiO/ZnO-WI < NiO/ZnO-CP < NiO/ZnO-HT < NiO/ZnO-CT. Chen et al. [25] proposed that a lower reduction temperature is associated with a smaller particle size. Thus, the NiO particle size in these catalysts also decreased in the same order. In addition, Figure 2 shows that there was a shoulder peak after the main peak for NiO/ZnO-CP, NiO/ZnO-HT, and NiO/ZnO-CT. However, a reversed sequence was observed for NiO/ZnO-WI. Generally, a low reduction temperature corre- sponds to the reduction of well dispersed species, while a high reduction temperature corresponds to aggregated species [26]. Thus, we deduce that the aggregation of NiO on NiO/ZnO-WI was the most severe among these NiO/ZnO precursors. Moreover, a careful inspection of the shape of the reduction peaks revealed that the reduction peaks of NiO/ZnO-HT and NiO/ZnO-CT were more symmetrical than that of NiO/ZnO-CP, implying that the hydrothermal treatment was beneficial for the dispersion of the active species on the sup- port. Figure 3 presents the XRD patterns of the Ni/ZnO catalysts. The features at 2È™ of 44.3 o and 51.8 o were ascribed to the (111) and (200) reflections of FCC Ni (JCPDS 004-0850) [27]. The other features were characteristic of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 036-1451) [28]. The XRD results indicated that both Ni and ZnO were crystalline in these catalysts. In addition, the widths of the (111) and (200) peaks of Ni increased in the order of Ni/ZnO-WI < Ni/ZnO-CP < Ni/ZnO-HT < Ni/ZnO-CT, while the peak intensity displayed an opposite order, reflecting the decrease of the crystallite size. From the Scherrer equation and the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of the Ni(111) peaks, the Ni crystallite sizes on these catalysts were calculated to be 25.0, 11.2, 9.4, and 8.7 nm, respectively. Figure 4 shows the TEM images of the Ni/ZnO catalysts. It was obvious that the Ni particles on the catalysts prepared by the WI and CP methods had aggregated notably. However, with the hydrothermal treatment, the Ni particles over Ni/ZnO-HT and Ni/ZnO-CT were dispersed better and had smaller sizes. From the particle size distribution histograms, the average particle sizes of Ni on Ni/ZnO-WI, Ni/ZnO-CP, Ni/ZnO-HT, and Ni/ZnO-CT were 25.6, 14.4, 11.1, and 10.3 nm, respec- tively. Also, the hydrothermal treatment led to a narrower particle size distribution. 2.2 Effect of preparation method on catalytic perform- ance Figure 5 presents the conversion of glycerol and selectivity for 1,2-PDO over the Ni/ZnO catalysts versus the WHSV. The conversion of glycerol over the four catalysts all decreased with the increase of the WHSV due to the shorter contact time. From the conversion of glycerol, it can be concluded that the activity increased in the order of Ni/ZnO-WI < Ni/ZnO-CP < Ni/ZnO-HT < Ni/ZnO-CT, in line with their A act. values com- piled in Table 1. XRD characterization revealed that after reduction, Ni was in the metallic state in these catalysts. Auneau et al. [29] re- ported that metal atoms serve as the active sites for the chemisorption of glycerol. Metallic Ni also catalyzed the re- forming of polyols [30] and the hydrogenation of unsaturated intermediates [31]. Thus, the catalyst with more surface me- tallic Ni atoms would be more active in the chemisorption of glycerol and successive reforming and hydrogenolysis reac- tions. As a result, the conversion of glycerol increased with the dispersion of Ni on these catalysts. Figure 5 also shows that the selectivity for 1,2-PDO first increased with the WHSV, reached a maximum, and then dropped at higher WHSVs. The highest selectivity for 1,2-PDO over Ni/ZnO-WI was at the WHSV of 0.72 h â€“1 , and at 0.84 h â€“1 over the other catalysts.

HU Jiye et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1266â€“1275 retical value, it was by far the best achieved on a non-precious metal catalyst, and it was also superior to the selectivity over precious metal catalysts under similar reaction conditions [20,21]. At the relatively low WHSV of 0.48 h â€“1 , the selectivity for 1,2-PDO decreased in the order of Ni/ZnO-WI > Ni/ZnO-CP > Ni/ZnO-HT > Ni/ZnO-CT, which was inversely proportional to the A act. values of these catalysts. In order to understand the effect of WHSV on the selectivity for 1,2-PDO, we compiled the product distribution over Ni/ZnO-CT at different WHSV values in Table 2. It is noted that the other catalysts showed a similar product distribution and WHSV dependence. At low WHSV, the main side prod- ucts were gas phase products and ethanol in the liquid phase. The summed selectivity of these side products reached 58.9% at the WHSV of 0.48 h â€“1 . In the literature, ethanol is produced from two reaction pathways: (1) glycerol undergoes Câ€“C bond breakage to yield ethylene glycol (EG), and EG is further hydrogenolyzed to ethanol [32], and (2) 1,2-PDO undergoes degradation reactions to yield ethanol and gas phase products over metal sites [22]. In our case, when the WHSV was in- creased from 0.48 to 0.84 h â€“1 , the selectivities for ethanol and gas phase products decreased steadily, while the selectivity for 1,2-PDO increased steadily, and there was no noticeable change in the selectivity to EG (included in others in Table 2). This observation suggested that the selectivities for ethanol and gas phase products should be related to the selectivity for (a) 100 nm (b) 100 nm (c) 100 nm (d) 100 nm 0 4 8 1216202428 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 F r e q u e n c y ( % ) (a) Particle size (nm) 0 4 8 1216202428 Particle size (nm) (b) 0 4 8 1216202428 Particle size (nm) (c) 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 Particle size (nm) (d) Fig. 4.

HU Jiye et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1266â€“1275 1,2-PDO, rather than to the selectivity for EG. Thus, it can be deduced that ethanol was mainly generated from the degrada- tion of 1,2-PDO over metallic Ni sites, which agreed with Wawrzetz et al. [22]. This deduction explained the experi- mental observation that at the low WHSV of 0.48 h â€“1 , a lower selectivity for 1,2-PDO was obtained on the catalyst with the higher Ni dispersion. With the increase of the WHSV, the contact time of 1,2-PDO with the catalyst decreased, making it less likely that it will undergo further degradation, thus im- proving the selectivity for 1,2-PDO. However, the selectivity for the intermediate, acetol, in- creased much more pronouncedly on further increasing the WHSV, and the selectivity for 1,2-PDO started to decrease when the WHSV exceeded 0.84 h â€“1 . According to Yu et al. [33], under a H 2 atmosphere, dehydration of glycerol to acetol (Reaction 2 in Scheme 1) is the rate-determining step for glycerol hydrogenolysis, and the hydrogenation of acetol (Reaction 3 in Scheme 1) takes place much more easily. However, in our reaction conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor in the absence of added H 2 , the hydrogena- tion of acetol may become the rate-determining step because hydrogen has to be generated in situ and the reaction system is under a H 2 -deficient state. A higher WHSV means a shorter contact time between acetol and catalyst, which is disadvan- tageous to its hydrogenation to 1,2-PDO. Therefore, when the WHSV exceeded 0.84 h â€“1 , the selectivity for acetol increased monotonically, while the selectivity for 1,2-PDO evolved with a reverse trend. 3 Conclusions Four Ni/ZnO catalysts with different Ni dispersions were prepared and used for APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. 1,2-PDO tended to degrade to ethanol and gas phase products at low WHSV, and the hydrogenation of acetol becomes the rate-determining step at high WHSV. At the optimized WHSV, the Ni/ZnO catalyst with the higher Ni dispersion gave more production of 1,2-PDO. The Ni/ZnO-CT showed a superior catalytic performance to the precious metal catalysts reported in the literature. The further investigation of the support prop- erties is expected to be instructive for the preparation of more effective non-precious metal catalysts for the APR-hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO.

Tel: +86-21-55664679; Fax: +86-21-55665701 The catalytic conversion of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) is generally conducted batch-wise in an autoclave in the presence of high pressure H2. The reforming and hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-PDO over Ni/ZnO catalysts in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor without added H2 was reported. The Ni/ZnO catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation (WI), co-precipitation (CP), hydrothermal treatment (HT), and carbon microsphere hard-templating (CT) methods. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and H2 titration. At a low weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of glycerol, the 1,2-PDO produced got degraded to ethanol and gas phase products over catalysts with high Ni dispersion, while at a high WHSV, the selectivity for 1,2-PDO was limited by the hydrogenation of the acetol intermediate. At the optimized WHSV, the catalyst with a higher Ni dispersion was more selective for 1,2-PDO, and over the Ni/ZnO catalyst with the highest Ni dispersion, the highest selectivity of 54.9% for 1,2-PDO was obtained at a glycerol conversion of 85.4% at the WHSV of 0.84 h−1. 摘要 采用浸渍法、共沉淀法、水热法和碳微球硬模板法制备了 Ni/ZnO 催化剂, 运用 X 射线衍射、程序升温还原、透射电子显微镜和氢滴定等手段对其进行了表征, 并用于连续固定床反应器中无外加氢气条件下的丙三醇重整-氢解反应. 结果表明, 在较低空速下, 生成的 1,2-丙二醇 (1,2-PDO) 易在 Ni 分散度较高的催化剂上进一步裂解为乙醇和气相产物; 而在较高空速下, 其选择性受制于中间产物丙酮醇的加氢. 在优化的空速下, Ni 分散度越高越有利于 1,2-PDO 的生成. 在 Ni 分散度最高的 Ni/ZnO 催化剂上, 当丙三醇质量空速为 0.84 h–1 时, 1,2-PDO 选择性最高, 为 54.9%, 丙三醇转化率为 85.4%.
