Burch, P.K. Loader, N.A. Cruise Catalysis Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 6AD, UK Received 26 March 1996; revised 6 June 1996; accepted 6 June 1996 Abstract A range of physical and chemical techniques have been used to investigate the interaction between rhodium and alumina at high temperature under oxidising conditions. Rh/AI203 catalysts have been studied by EXAFS, TPR, and H2 chemisorption after different calcination treatments, and catalytic reactions (CH4, CO, and C3H6 oxidation, and NO reduction with C3H6 in the presence of excess oxygen) have been used as highly sensitive and specific chemical probes. It has been found for 1% Rh/AI203, that after low temperature calcination (300) the rhodium is present as small easily reduced oxide clusters spread out on the alumina surface. The resulting catalyst has high activity for oxidation reactions due to the presence of reactive terminal (Rh-O) oxygens. However, the high oxidation activity leads to poor selectivity in the reduction of NO with C3H6 in excess oxygen. Calcination at higher temperatures (500 to 700) causes the rhodium to interact strongly with the alumina support and become increasingly difficult to reduce. These catalysts have low activity for oxidation reactions but are highly selective for the reduction of NO to N2. EXAFS data show that the rhodium is almost all present as isolated ions with high co-ordination to both oxygen and aluminium. These results are taken to show that, whilst the rhodium is still exposed at the surface, it is now in the alumina surface layer, but strongly bound and thus difficult to reduce. During this high temperature calcination, it is thought that the rhodium spreads over the support and diffuses into defect sites in the alumina surface. Keywords: Rhodium; Alumina; Deactivation; EXAFS; TPR; H2 chemisorption 1. Introduction Despite both its high cost, and attempts to find a cheaper alternative, rhodium is still used as a component in automotive three-way catalysts, primarily due to its high activity for the reduction of NO [ 1]. It has been known for many years, however, that deactivation of the rhodium occurs at high temperature ( > 600) in an oxidising atmosphere due to interaction with the y-alumina support [2]. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bureh et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375 394 Whilst a similar effect is not seen with either c~-alumina or zirconia [3], the low surface area of these materials makes them less suitable for use as supports in three-way catalysts. In the light of this, it becomes important to understand the nature of the rhodium-alumina interaction in order to develop ways of prevent- ing it occurring under 'lean-burn' conditions. Various studies of the rhodium-alumina system have been previously re- ported [2-9] but no definite conclusion as to the mechanism of the interaction has been reached. In all cases the amount of surface rhodium is seen to decrease after heat treatment and the rhodium becomes more difficult to reduce. Since there are no known compounds formed between rhodium oxide and alumina [4], the formation of a mixed oxide has been ruled out. Other explanations involve: covering of the rhodium by a layer of alumina [4], the formation of a non- stoichiometric rhodium oxide phase which is strongly interacted with the alumina [5], rhodium oxide platelets or rafts [6], or the diffusion of rhodium ions into the alumina lattice [2,4,7-9]. This paper presents results of a further study of the Rh/A1203 system in which chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction, EXAFS, and various chemical reactions have been employed in order to elucidate the nature of the rhodium-support interaction. The catalytic reactions have been used as a highly sensitive chemical probe to characterise the surface species present on the samples. The use of these methods in conjunction with chemisorption and spectroscopic techniques enable us to reach a better understanding of the nature of the metal-support interaction and the resultant catalyst structure. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The catalysts were prepared by impregnation using the incipient wetness method. The support (T-AI203, Akzo Chemie CK300, 175 m2 g-l) was crushed to 250-600 /zm and dried at 500 for 2 h. The alumina was cooled and added to the required volume of RhIx! nitrate solution (Johnson Matthey) to give either 1% or 0.1% Rh by weight, left to stand for 3 h at room temperature, and dried at 120 for 16 h. The resulting catalyst precursors were calcined in a muffle furnace for 16 h at either 500, 600, or 700. In addition, a further sample of the precursor was calcined at 500 for 2 h (in order to fully decompose the nitrate precursor), reduced at 500 for 2 h in static hydrogen, and finally calcined for 2 h at 300. 2.2. Catalyst characterization The catalysts were characterized by H2 chemisorption, temperature pro- grammed reduction (TPR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EX- AFS). R. Burch et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996)375-394 377 Chemisorption experiments were carried out in a vacuum system. The sample (50-100 mg) was first outgassed at 200 for 1 h before being reduced in ca. 0.8 atm H2. The reduction was performed either for 30 min at 300 or for 60 min at 500. The sample was then outgassed at the reduction temperature, cooled to room temperature, and the hydrogen chemisorption measured. The results will be shown both as the total uptake of H2 and as H/Rh ratios. The H/Rh values are given only for indicative purposes and should not be taken as a measure of the degree of dispersion of the metal, since for many of the samples not all of the rhodium will have been reduced at the temperatures used for the reduction step prior to taking the chemisorption readings. TPR experiments were carried out using between 12 and 60 mg of catalyst. The sample was heated from room temperature to 750 at 10 min-J in 5% H2/Ar (10 cm3 min- l). The hydrogen uptake was measured using a TCD, the exit gas from the reactor being passed through a dry-ice trap to remove any water produced during reduction. Rhodium K-edge EXAFS data were collected in transmission mode on Station 9.2 at the Daresbury Laboratory SRS, with an electron beam energy of 2 GeV and an average beam current of 200 mA. The Si(220) monochromator was adjusted to give 50% harmonic rejection. Samples were finely ground and approximately 2 mm thickness of the powder held in an aluminium holder between sheets of Sellotape. Two scans were recorded for each sample at -80. These were normalised and averaged using the data analysis described below. A general expression [10] used in the interpretation of EXAFS data, which relates structural parameters to the measured EXAFS oscillations is: x(k) = -a(k)~j( NjkR2)[fj( k,zr )[exp(- 2 orj2 k2) exp(- 2Rj/h)sin(ZkRj + 261 + Oj) where x(k) is the magnitude of the EXAFS as a function of the photoelectron wave vector k. Nj is the number of identical scattering atoms at an average interatomic distance Rj in the jth coordination shell. The terms 261 + 0j are phase-shifts experienced by the photoelectron during the outgoing and scatter process, and fj(k,Tr) is the backscatter amplitude of the photoelectron wave. h is the mean free path of the photoelectron. There is also a Debye-Waller factor which depends on o)2, the mean variation in Rj. The elastic mean free path parameter h and A(k), an amplitude factor, measure the proportion of absorp- tion events that result in excitation of a single photoelectron. PAXAS [11] and EXCURV92 [12] were used to isolate the EXAFS contribu- tion and analyse the data. The phase-shift terms in the above equation are obtained within EXCURV92 using ab initio calculations. Fitting the experimen- tal spectrum in k space involves calculating a spectrum using an assumed set of structural parameters and scattering data. EXCURV92 varies the structural parameters R, N, and A until a best least-squares fit is obtained. 378 R. Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 Since the phase-shifts were determined by ab initio calculations within EXCURV92, the use of standards was not necessary for the analysis of the data. Crystallographic data and absorption spectra obtained previously for Rh203 and RhO2 [5] were used for comparison with our results. 2.3. Catalyst testing The four reactions studied were the combustion of methane, CO oxidation, propene combustion, and the reduction of NO by propene, all in oxygen rich atmospheres. In each case 100 mg of catalyst were used. For CH4 and CO combustion experiments the catalyst was heated in the reaction mixture (1% reagent/air, 100 cm3 min-1) to reaction temperature (140 for CO, 300 for CH4) and samples taken for analysis as the tempera- ture was increased. The analysis was performed by gas chromatography using an FID fitted with a Ni/ZrO2 methanator catalyst to allow detection of CO and CO2. For CH4 combustion in some instances the catalyst was then heated to 700 in air (60 cm3 min-1), held at this temperature for 1 h, and cooled back down to 300 in air. The gas was switched back to CH4/air and activity measurements made up to 500. Additional experiments were carried out in which the catalyst was held at each temperature for 1 or 2 h in the reaction mixture in order to observe any deactivation or activation. Propene oxidation experiments were performed using 1000 ppm propene and 5% 02, with balance He to give a total gas flow of 200 cm3 min-1. The temperature of the catalyst was increased between room temperature and 500 at 7 min-i, and the reaction followed by measuring the amount of CO2 produced, using an infra-red CO2 analyser. For NO reduction experiments the gas mix consisted of 500 ppm NO, 1000 ppm propene, 5% 02 with He balance and a total flow of 200 cm3 min- ~. The temperature was increased in intervals between room temperature and 500. At each temperature the NO and total NOx concentrations were monitored by chemiluminescence. The production of N20 was not monitored. The sample was then held at 500 in the reaction mixture for 1 h, cooled to 100, and the reaction again monitored up to 500. 3. Results 3.1. Catalyst characterization The results obtained for the 1% Rh catalysts from chemisorption experiments are shown in Table 1. It is clear that after reduction at 300 the amount of hydrogen uptake decreases with increasing calcination temperature. It is also apparent that for a given sample, with the exception of the catalyst calcined at 300, reduction at 500 leads to higher H2 uptake than reduction at 300. This increase is five-fold for the catalyst calcined at 700, but is less R.

For the sample calcined at 300 there is little change in the H2 uptake after reduction at 500. It is also of note that after reduction at 500 the catalyst calcined at 500 now takes up more hydrogen than that calcined at 300, in contrast to what was seen after reduction at 300. The results obtained from TPR experiments on these catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. For the catalyst calcined at 300 there is a large peak between 100 and 200, centred at 125. In addition there is a second, smaller peak at 250 and a broad feature between 300 and 500. For the catalysts calcined at 500 or above no low temperature peak is seen, although a very small feature is seen between 100 and 220 for the sample calcined at 500.

Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 this sample is seen at 295, in addition to a broad feature below 500, similar to that seen for the catalyst calcined at 300. On the sample calcined at 600 reduction does not begin until 250, whereas for that calcined at 700 there is no reduction below 350. The total amount of Rh reduced during the TPR experiments are shown in Table 1, assuming the Rh is present initially as Rh3+. For the sample calcined at 300 all the rhodium in the sample has been reduced during the run. As the calcination temperature increases, the amount of rhodium which is reduced during the TPR experiment falls. For the catalyst calcined at 700 only 30% of the rhodium is reduced, even though the temperature has been ramped to 750. It is clear from these results that increasing the calcination temperature leads to both a decrease in the amount of reducible rhodium and an increase in the temperature at which the reduction occurs. EXAFS data obtained for the catalysts calcined at 300, 500 and 700 are shown in Fig. 2. Results obtained from analysis of the data (theoretical curves also shown in Fig. 2) are given in Table 2. The feature visible at < 2 ,~ in Fig. 2(b) is believed to be due to noisy data, although attempts to remove it during the background subtraction were only partially successful. A similar feature was seen previously for oxidised Rh/AI203 by Beck [5], who attributed it to residual background, and for a reduced Rh/AI203 catalyst by van Zon et al. [13], who interpreted it as being due to interference :ween the Rh-O and Rh-Rh EXAFS functions. o For all samples there is an oxygen shell at 2 A. This Rh-O distance is typical of that seen for both bulk Rh203 [5] and for oxidised Rh/A1203 catalysts [5,14]. The samples also contain both a Rh shell at 2.8 ,~ and a A1 shell at 2.99 A. These distances are in conflict with other work.

Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 147 (1996) 375-394 2.8 ,~ is similar to that seen for Rh both in Rh foil [5] and for reduced Rh/A1203 catalysts (2.7 A) [13,15], whereas in our samples the Rh will be in an oxidised form. In addition, Beck et al. [5] suggest that for Rh203 in A1203 the Rh-A1 distance should be 2.7 ,~ rather than 2.99 A. However, further analysis in which we tried to fit these shells to our data proved unsuccessful, and we are therefore confident that assignments of Rh-Rh and Rh-A1 distances given in Table 2 are correct. The figures given in the final column of Table 2 also show that our results give an acceptable fit between the experimental and theoretical data. For the sample calcined at 300, in addition to the three shells mentioned above, there is a Rh-Rh distance of 3 ~,. This is again similar to Rh203, but the co-ordination number is far lower (0.7 as opposed to 4 for the bulk oxide). Upon increasing the calcination temperature to 500 the Rh shell at 3 /~ is seen to disappear, the co-ordination number for Rh-O at 2 A increases from 6.4 to 6.9, o and an extra oxygen shell is seen at 2.4 A. In addition, the co-ordination number for the A1 shell at 3 ,~ increases and a further A1 shell is seen at 3.3 A. Calcination at 700 leads to a further increase in the amount of co-ordination to aluminium, the Rh-Rh and Rh-O shells being little affected. 3.2. Catalyst testing 3.2.1. Methane combustion Results obtained for the methane combustion experiments are shown in Figs. 3-5. In all cases CO2 was the only carbon containing product of oxidation. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained for 0.1% Rh catalysts. As expected, the activity decreases with increasing calcination temperature, the sample calcined at 700 having particularly low activity, giving only 10% conversion at 500.

Again, the increase in calcination temperature leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. Thus, at 400 conversions of 88, 24, 13, and 7% are seen for calcination temperatures of 300, 500, 600, and 700, respectively. After the acquisition of the data shown in Fig. 4(a), the catalysts, with the 384 R. Burch et al.// Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 exception of that calcined at 300, were heated in air at 700 for 1 h, in order to simulate the highest temperature calcination treatment. Results of activity measurements taken after this treatment are shown in Fig. 4(b). The high temperature air treatment had no effect on the activity of the catalyst which had already been calcined at 700 for 16 h, compare Fig. 4(a) and 4(b). However, both the catalysts previously calcined at lower temperatures were deactivated to a similar level, although the activity did not completely fall to the level of the catalyst calcined at 700 for 16 h. Thus, the conversion at 400 fell from 24 to 12% for the catalyst calcined originally at 500, and from 13 to 10% for that calcined originally at 600. Thus it appears that the majority of the deactivation caused by high temperature calcination occurs within the first hour, and heating for a further 15 h has a much smaller effect. Fig. 5 shows results obtained for methane conversion with time at 500 subsequent to the experiments shown in Fig. 4(b). It is seen that all three catalysts show an increase in activity over the 3.5 h time period. For the samples calcined at 500 and 600 the activity increases to 87%, and for that calcined at 700 it increased to 63%. For the latter two samples, the final level is higher than that seen after the first heating (Fig. 4(a)). In order to investigate the origin of this effect a sample of the catalyst calcined at 700 was tested for the methane combustion reaction at 500, heated in air or N2 at 500 for 2 h, and tested again for methane combustion. In neither case was an increase in activity caused by the 2 h treatment. It appears, therefore, that the activation is due to the CH4/air mixture. 100 90 80 70 60 % Conversion 50 40 .~ 30 20 10 0-- S I I I I i I 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 Time/h Fig. 5.

The catalyst activation was studied further by holding catalyst samples in the CH4/air mixture for longer periods of time at each reaction temperature and monitoring any changes in activity. For the sake of brevity the results are not shown but it was found that an activation was again seen, although for each sample it was dependent on the reaction temperature. Thus, for the catalysts calcined at 500 and 600 an increase in activity was seen only at 450 and above. For the catalyst calcined at 700, no activation was seen at or below 450, although it was at 500. 3.2.2. CO oxidation Results obtained for the 1% Rh/A1203 catalysts in the CO oxidation reaction are shown in Fig. 6. All the catalysts show a sharp rise in activity to 100% conversion. As with methane combustion, the overall activity decreases with increasing calcination temperature. The temperatures for complete combustion for samples calcined at 300, 500, 600, and 700 are 193, 225, 245, and 267, respectively. 3.2.3. Propene combustion Results for propene combustion are shown in Fig. 7. As with the other oxidation reactions the activity decreases with increasing calcination tempera- ture, the largest difference being seen between the samples calcined at 500 and 700. It is also of note that the 1% Rh samples (Fig. 7(a)) are only slightly more active than the corresponding 0.1% Rb catalysts (Fig. 7(b)). This is in 386 R.

As expected, the total NOx conversion passes through a maximum and in both cases the temperature of this maximum increases with calcination temperature. For the fresh catalysts, calcination at 500 or above leads to a maximum conversion of NO to N2 of more than 70%, whereas for the sample calcined at 300 the maximum is ca. 50%. This is interesting since, from chemisorption, the amount of easily reducible rhodium appears to be far less on the catalysts calcined at 500 or above than on that calcined at 300. Results obtained after the catalysts had been left in the reaction mixture at 500 for 1 h are shown in Fig. 8(b). The maximum values of NO conversion to N2 (Table 3) for the samples calcined at 300 and 500 are similar (ca. 50%), and that for the sample calcined at 700 slightly lower (47%). The sample calcined at 600 shows the highest activity (57%). Comparison with the results obtained for the fresh catalysts (Table 3) shows that there is little change in the behaviour of the catalyst calcined at 300. However, all the samples calcined at higher temperatures have become less active for NO reduction, although the temperature at which the maximum occurs is unchanged. Fig. 9 and Table 3 show similar results for the 0.1% Rh/A1203 catalysts. For the same calcination temperature, the fresh catalysts show both a higher temperature for the maximum conversion of NO to N2, and a lower value of this maximum conversion, than was seen for the 1% catalysts. All the fresh 0.1% Rh samples (Fig. 9(a)) show a similar maximum conversion of NO to N2 (ca. 35%). Thus, unlike the 1% catalysts, there is no major difference between the sample calcined at 300 and those calcined at higher temperatures in terms of maximum conversion. However, the temperature at which this maximum is observed increases markedly as the calcination temperature is increased. After treatment in reaction mixture for 1 h at 500 (Fig. 9(b)), the catalyst calcined at 300 is little affected, the temperature of the maximum increasing by 10, and the maximum conversion of NO to N2 falling very slightly (see 388 R.

The sample calcined at 500 shows a slightly larger decrease in conversion to N2 and the temperature of the maximum decreases by 20. However, the sample calcined at 700 shows a large decrease in the tempera- ture of maximum conversion, this value falling by 55.

Discussion The aim of the experiments reported above has been to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between Rh and an alumina support. As 390 R. Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 indicated in the Introduction, several explanations have been proposed to account for the deactivation of Rh/AI203 catalysts: encapsulation or decoration of the Rh by a layer of alumina [4]; a strong rhodium-alumina interaction leading to the formation of a non-stoichiometric rhodium oxide [5]; rhodium oxide platelets or rafts [6]; dissolution of rhodium ions in the alumina lattice [2,4,7-9]. The approach we have taken in our investigation has been to use a selection of techniques, both physical and chemical, and to combine the results of these studies. Thus, catalysts have been characterised physically by EXAFS and TPR, and chemically by H2 chemisorption and a series of catalytic probe reactions. As mentioned in the Introduction, the catalytic reactions have been used as an additional highly sensitive chemical probe in order to identify the nature of the surface of the catalysts after different thermal treatments. It should be noted that it is not the intention of the present work to provide an in depth study of any of the individual reactions or techniques, but rather to combine the data from a wide variety of complementary methods to obtain a clearer picture of the mechanisms involved in the deactivation of Rh/AI203 catalysts. The TPR data for the 1% Rh/AI203 catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1) show, as expected, that increasing the calcination temperature causes the rhodium to become harder to reduce. It is clear from the Figure that the catalyst calcined at 300 is the only sample which contains easily reduced rhodium oxide, as seen by the reduction peak at 125. This peak has previously been attributed [2,16] to rhodium oxide particles having no interaction with the support. At higher calcination temperatures the degree of reduction at lower temperatures de- creases, indicating an increase in the amount of rhodium which has interacted strongly with the alumina. The results in Fig. 4(a), and 6 show for CH4 and CO oxidation that the catalyst calcined at 300 has a much greater activity for oxidation reactions than those calcined at higher temperatures. Therefore it can be concluded that easily reduced rhodium oxide is the active species for combustion. The smaller difference seen for propene combustion when the calcination temperature is increased, and the fact that 0.1% Rh catalysts are not much less active than the 1% Rh samples for this reaction, may be because the propene reaction is more facile so Rh oxide interacted with the support still has a significant activity. The C3H6-NO-O2 reaction involves a competition between oxidation, of propene to CO2 and NO to NO2, and reduction, of NO to N2. Therefore, the selectivity of the reaction should act as a further indicator of the presence or absence of easily reduced rhodium oxide on the catalyst because this species will be too good at the oxidation reactions to allow efficient reduction of the NO to N2. The results shown in Fig. 8(a) for the fresh 1% Rh catalysts do indeed show this. Thus, the maximum conversion of NO to N2 is lowest on the sample calcined at 300 which contains easily reduced non-interacted rhodium oxide. However, the most striking feature is the exceptionally high selectivity seen for the catalysts calcined at or above 500. As discussed above, these samples R. Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 391 appear to contain increasingly large amounts of the 'interacted' rhodium species. The results shown in Fig. 8(a) make it abundantly clear that this species cannot be Rh covered by a layer of alumina, as has been proposed [4], since AI ions will not have this high selectivity. Rather, the results show that some rhodium is indeed present on the surface of the catalyst in a form which is selective for the reduction of NO to N2. Isolated Rh ions would be one possibility but, as will be discussed below, crystalline RheO3 is ruled out. The TPR trace in Fig. 1 shows that the catalyst calcined at 300 contains easily reducible rhodium. However, the EXAFS data (Table 2) indicate that this is not present as particles of RhzO3 since the co-ordination number for the Rh shell at 3 A is too low (< 1). Whilst it is not possible to assign any definite structure to the data, it is clear that the rhodium in this sample is present as small clusters containing only 3 or 4 Rh ions. Since the co-ordination to A1 is relatively low the clusters can be viewed as being found on the alumina surface, and as such will be easily reducible. The high oxidation activity may be due to the presence of reactive terminal (Rh-O) oxygens. It can be seen from Table 2 that for the catalysts calcined at 500 and 700 there is more co-ordination to both A1 and O than for the sample calcined at 300. This suggests that high temperature calcination produces samples in which the rhodium is surrounded by an oxygen lattice which also contains aluminium. It has been suggested that the rhodium may dissolve into the alumina lattice [2,4,7-9]. However, as mentioned previously, the high selectivity of these samples in the NO reduction reaction shows that the rhodium is still exposed at the surface. In the light of this, our results indicate that the rhodium is found in the alumina surface rather than being supported on it or buried below it, and that these rhodium ions constitute the 'interacted' species men- tioned above. If the rhodium is incorporated into the surface of the alumina it would be expected to be harder to reduce. Thus, the low combustion activity may be due to a lack of terminal oxygens, since the oxygen co-ordination around a Rh ion will be made up of oxide ions within the surface and the first sub-surface layer of oxide ions in the alumina. From the above discussion it is clear that between 300 and 700 heat treatment in air gives catalysts which change from a state which contains almost exclusively easily reduced rhodium oxide clusters on the alumina surface to one in which the rhodium is all present as Rh3ions in the alumina surface. Thus, at temperatures of 500 or above Rh initially present as particles or clusters of rhodium oxide on the A1203 may spread over the support and diffuse into defect sites in the alumina surface and become strongly bound. This process could ultimately lead to complete incorporation of the Rh into the alumina surface. The high co-ordination to A1 obtained from EXAFS experiments (Table 2) suggests that this may be the case for the catalyst calcined at 700. From Fig. 1 it is apparent that even during calcination at 300 some rhodium can diffuse into defect sites (as evidenced by the broad reduction feature between 300 and 392 R. Burch et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 500), although a large majority of the rhodium is present as easily reduced oxide clusters. It is of further note that after reduction at 500 the hydrogen uptake is greater for the sample calcined at 500 than that calcined at 300 (Table 1). Since TPR data (Fig. 1) show that the amount of Rh reduced will be greater for the sample calcined at 300, it is clear that the Rh in the catalyst calcined at 500 is more dispersed, although less easy to reduce. This further suggests that during high temperature calcination the rhodium spreads over the alumina, thus gaining access to defect sites in the alumina surface. Less spreading of the Rh will occur during calcination at 300 so only adjacent defect sites will be filled, leading to a catalyst with large amounts of non-inter- acted rhodium. The above model may be used to further explain the catalytic data. It is possible that the activation seen with time on stream for the catalysts calcined at 500 and above during CH4 combustion (Fig. 5) may be due to the formation of more of the easily reduced rhodium oxide clusters. The fact that the activation was seen only in the reaction mix containing CH4 and not in either air or S2 suggests that this may be due to a partial reduction of the interacted rhodium species by CH4. In addition, the temperature at which the activation is observed is higher for the sample calcined at the highest temperature. Since TPR shows that the Rh in this sample is the hardest to reduce, this gives further evidence that a reduction process is occurring in the reaction mixture. It should also be pointed out that, since CH4 combustion is a highly exothermic process, the initial increase in conversion may lead to an increase in the catalyst temperature and therefore to a further rise in conversion. However, since a thermocouple was situated within the catalyst bed we were able to keep the average bed tempera- ture constant. We therefore believe that much of the activation seen is a real effect although some of the increase in activity may be due to local heating of metal particles within the catalyst. Fig. 8(b) shows results obtained after the 1% Rh catalysts had been left in the C3H6-NO-O2 mixture at 500 for 1 h. It is clear that for the samples calcined at 500 and above the selectivity for NO reduction is less than for fresh samples (compare with Fig. 8(a)). This indicates a loss of the selective rhodium species, possibly due to a partial reduction of the rhodium by propene in a similar manner to that discussed above for CH4. In summary, a combination of physical and chemical probes has been used to elucidate the mechanism of the Rh-alumina interaction which occurs at high temperatures under oxidising conditions. It appears that the interaction involves the incorporation of Rh ions into the alumina surface by diffusion into defect sites. These results suggest that it may be possible to block the Rh-alumina interaction if another ion is used to block the defect sites in the surface of the alumina, although the preparation of this modified alumina will have to be carefully controlled. This has been found recently in this laboratory [17] where the addition of 20% Zr to alumina in a single impregnation step led to catalysts R. Burch et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 375-394 393 in which the Rh-alumina interaction was only slightly modified. An attempt to block the alumina surface with La was also only partially successful [18], although it was found that the rhodium formed a mixed oxide with the lanthanum and thus lost its activity. Therefore, the choice of 'blocking' ion will also have to be made carefully. 5. Conclusions Treatment of 1% Rh/A1203 under oxidising conditions at 300 gives a catalyst which mostly contains small clusters of easily reduced rhodium oxide on the alumina support. This species is highly active for oxidation reductions but has poor selectivity for the reduction of NO under lean-burn conditions. Oxidation at 500 or above causes a strong Rh-alumina interaction during which the rhodium is incorporated into the surface layer of the alumina and becomes hard to reduce. Rhodium in this state has low activity for combustion reactions but is highly selective for NO reduction to N2.

All rights reserved An investigation of the deactivation of Rh/alumina catalysts under strong oxidising conditions R. Burch P.K. Loader N.A. Cruise Catalysis Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 6AD, UK A range of physical and chemical techniques have been used to investigate the interaction between rhodium and alumina at high temperature under oxidising conditions. Rh/Al2O3 catalysts have been studied by EXAFS, TPR, and H2 chemisorption after different calcination treatments, and catalytic reactions (CH4, CO, and C3H6 oxidation, and NO reduction with C3H6 in the presence of excess oxygen) have been used as highly sensitive and specific chemical probes. It has been found for 1% Rh/Al2O3, that after low temperature calcination (300°C) the rhodium is present as small easily reduced oxide clusters spread out on the alumina surface. The resulting catalyst has high activity for oxidation reactions due to the presence of reactive terminal (RhO) oxygens. However, the high oxidation activity leads to poor selectivity in the reduction of NO with C3H6 in excess oxygen. Calcination at higher temperatures (500 to 700°C) causes the rhodium to interact strongly with the alumina support and become increasingly difficult to reduce. These catalysts have low activity for oxidation reactions but are highly selective for the reduction of NO to N2. EXAFS data show that the rhodium is almost all present as isolated ions with high co-ordination to both oxygen and aluminium. These results are taken to show that, whilst the rhodium is still exposed at the surface, it is now in the alumina surface layer, but strongly bound and thus difficult to reduce. During this high temperature calcination, it is thought that the rhodium spreads over the support and diffuses into defect sites in the alumina surface.
