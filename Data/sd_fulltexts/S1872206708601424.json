Protic solvents such as ethanol and water favored the formation of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol. Binary solvents containing a protic component showed a synergetic solvent effect on the selective dehydroxylation of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol. The protic component in the binary solvent in- fluenced the performance of the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst. Key words: platinum; tungsten oxide; zirconia; glycerol; dehydroxylation; 1,3-propanediol; solvent effect � 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is an important commodity chemical that is used in the synthesis of new biodegradable polyesters, e.g. poly(trimethylene terephthalate) [1]. 1,3-PD is currently produced from petroleum derivatives such as ethyl- ene oxide (Shell route) or from acrolein (Degussa- DuPont route) by catalytic reactions [2]. With the depletion of petro- leum, it is necessary to develop an alternative route. Glycerol is one of the top twelve building block chemicals that can be derived from plant sources [3]. The rapid devel- opment of biodiesel production has made large quantities of glycerol available as a byproduct, and it can be an ideal re- newable feedstock for 1,3-PD. Several routes have been de- veloped to convert glycerol into 1,3-PD. Dupont developed a biological approach to produce 1,3-PD by glycerol fermenta- tion [4]. Its drawbacks were low productivity and a short life span for the bacterial strains. Wang et al. [5] have carried out the selective dehydroxylation of glycerol to 1,3-PD in three steps, but despite a high selectivity for 1,3-PD (>70%), their process was rather complicated and energy-consuming. Che [6] and Drent et al. [7] have attempted to get 1,3-PD from glycerol in homogeneous catalytic systems. However, prob- lems like harsh conditions and the leaching of the noble metal catalysts remain to be solved. Compared with the above methods, the direct hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,3-PD over a heterogeneous catalyst is more desirable. Although various solid catalysts have been reported [8–11], there were few that were efficient in the catalysis of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol. Chaminand et al. [2] reported a good result (i.e., 1,3-PD/ 1,2-PD = 2) by running the reaction in sulfolane using Rh/C and tungstic acid as a co-catalytic system. Recently, Kurosaka et al. [4] made a breakthrough when they obtained 28% selec- tivity for 1,3-PD by the hydrogenolysis of glycerol over a Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) as solvent. It is apparent that the solvents, acidic sup- ports, and metal catalytic components with a hydrogenation ability play important roles in removing the central hydroxyl group in glycerol. The hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,3-PD is a substitution reaction, in which a H atom substitutes for the central hy- droxyl group in glycerol. It is well known that secondary al- cohols are more active than primary alcohols for the chlorina- tion reaction in the Lucas reagent. Consequently, we assume that the central hydroxyl group in glycerol can be activated more easily than the terminal ones by solid acid sites and then removed by hydrogenation on metallic sites, but the central hydroxyl group in glycerol is less accessible due to steric hin- drance. We hypothesize that protic solvents with a strong pro- ton transfer ability can facilitate the activation of the central GONG Leifeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1189–1191 hydroxyl group in glycerol by the surface acid sites. Accord- ingly, protic and protic-aprotic solvents with proton transfer ability were used in this work to improve the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity for 1,3-PD. The Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst was prepared according to the literature [4]. Glycerol hydrogenolysis reactions were carried out in a 100 ml autoclave. Glycerol solution (10% 40 ml) and 1 ml catalyst were introduced into the autoclave. After this was purged six times with pure H 2 , the reactor was pressurized with H 2 to 5.5 MPa and then heated to the reaction temperature of 170 o C. The agitation rate was 700 r/min. After reaction for 12 h, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. Gas phase products were collected in a pocket sampler and analyzed by a Agilent 3000A Micro gas chromatograph. The liquid phase product was esterified by acetic anhydride and analyzed by an Agilent 4890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ioni- zation detector and a HP-5 capillary column. The remaining glycerol was analyzed by an Agilent 1100 liquid chromato- graph with an OA 1000 column. Table 1 lists the results of glycerol hydrogenolysis over the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst in different solvents. When DMI was used as the reaction solvent, glycerol conversion reached 32.5%. 1-Propanol (1-PO) was the main product while the se- lectivities for 1,3-PD and 1,2-PD were 15.2% and 18.2%, re- spectively. The 1,3-PD yield was lower than reported. The possible reason may be the lower H 2 pressure and the much larger scale of our study by more than one hundred times than that in the literature [4]. A similar glycerol conversion was obtained in the case of sulfolane as a solvent. It was interesting to find that less 1,3-PD than 1,2-PD (1,3-PD/1,2-PD < 1) was produced in the aprotic solvents DMI and sulfolane. The re- verse case (1,3-PD/1,2-PD > 1) occurred in the protic solvents ethanol and water. In addition, the selectivities to 1,3-PD in the protic solvents ethanol and water were much higher than those in the aprotic solvents. On the basis of above observations, we can suggest that a protic solvent, such as ethanol and water, is ionized to produce protons by the surface acid sites of the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst, and this facilitated the transfer of the formed proton that acts as a Brönsted acid in the liquid reaction. These freely transferrable protons can overcome the steric hindrance to the central hydroxyl group in glycerol such that the central hydroxyl group has almost the same accessibility for activation as the terminal hydroxyl groups. Nimlos et al. [12] reported that the proton affinity for the central hydroxyl in glycerol was 195.4 kcal/mol, while that for the terminal hy- droxyl groups was 194.8 kcal/mol, which means that the cen- tral hydroxyl group in glycerol is easier to activate when it has the same exposure to protons. This would explain the higher selectivity for 1,3-PD when the reaction was performed in ethanol or water than that in DMI or sulfolane. The data shown in Table 1 also indicate that all three kinds of binary solvent tested exhibited a synergetic solvent effect on 1,3-PD formation, namely, the 1,3-PD yield in each of the three kinds of binary solvent was higher than that obtained in the pure solvent, e.g., the 1,3-PD yield was enhanced to 11.0% in the DMI-water solvent, which was much higher than that in DMI (4.9%) or in water (6.3%). Interestingly, ethanol and the binary solvents containing ethanol gave a higher glycerol conversion than those of any other of the solvents tested in this work. The effect of water content in the DMI-water binary solvent on the performance of the glycerol hydrogenolysis over the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The maximum of glycerol conversion occurred at a water content of 10%. The further increase of water content from 20% to 75% resulted in almost a constant glycerol con- version of about 32%, which was almost the same as in the case of pure DMI. It is important to emphasize that the increase of water content from 0% to 50% led to a distinct increase of the selectivity to 1,3-PD from 15.2% to 34.9%, which was almost the highest selectivity to 1,3-PD over the solid catalysts in re- cent reports. Interestingly, the selectivity to 1,2-PD exhibited a reverse trend to that of 1,3-PD and the minimum 6.3% was obtained at a water content of 75%. The increase of water content from 0 to 10% resulted in a remarkable decrease of selectivity for 1-PO from 40% to 20%, and then it was almost constant with the further increase of water content in the DMI-water binary solvent. The 1,3-PD/1,2-PD ratio increased distinctly along with water content from 0 to 75% and the maximum was as high as 4.21, which was almost twice as much as that reported previously [4]. It was obvious that there was a synergetic solvent effect on the selective dehydroxyla- Table 1 Influence of solvents on hydrogenolysis of glycerol over the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst Selectivity (%) Solvent Conversion (%) 1,3-PD 1,2-PD 1-PO Others 1,3-PD yield (%) 1,3-PD/1,2-PD molar ratio DMI 32.5 15.2 18.2 42.0 22.7 4.9 0.83 Sulfolane 33.8 5.3 14.6 19.9 57.2 1.8 0.36 Ethanol 38.2 23.0 13.6 46.6 12.7 8.8 1.69 Water 24.7 25.7 15.0 21.3 35.0 6.3 1.71 DMI-water 31.6 34.9 8.7 20.4 34.0 11.0 4.03 DMI-ethanol 45.6 29.3 18.9 33.1 16.7 13.3 1.55 Ethanol-water 45.7 21.2 8.0 32.1 35.7 9.7 2.65 Reaction conditions: 10% glycerol solution 40 ml, initial H 2 pressure 5.5 MPa, reaction temperature 170 o C, reaction time 12 h, catalyst 1 ml. Three binary solvents were prepared by mixing two solvents in mass ratio of 1:1. PD—Propanediol, PO—Propanol, DMI—1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone. Others include 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, methane, ethane, and propane. GONG Leifeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(12): 1189–1191 tion of glycerol with the DMI-water binary solvent. Interest- ingly, the solvent effect still existed even when the water con- tent was as small as 10%. The solvent effect promoted the formation of 1,3-PD. Besides the influence of the solvent, the acidic strength of the catalyst was also another key factor in the selectivity for 1,3-PD. We suggest that a suitable acidic strength for the catalyst is needed to selectively activate the central hydroxyl group in glycerol while leaving two terminal hydroxyls intact. A stronger acidic strength of the catalyst would activate the three hydroxyl groups in glycerol indis- criminately and produce more 1,2-PD than 1,3-PD according to statistical probability. Subsequent research concerning the ef- fect of acidic strength over the catalyst on 1,3-PD selectivity will be done in our laboratory. In summary, protic solvents, such as water and ethanol, fa- vor 1,3-PD formation when they were used instead of aprotic solvents, such as DMI and sulfolane, in glycerol selective de- hydroxylation over a Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst. Binary solvents, such as DMI-water, ethanol-water, and DMI-ethanol mixtures, showed a synergetic solvent effect on the selectivity for 1,3-PD. Ethanol and the binary solvents containing ethanol gave a higher glycerol conversion than those without ethanol. The water content in the DMI-water binary solvent influenced the performance of the Pt/WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalyst. References 1 Stinson S C.
