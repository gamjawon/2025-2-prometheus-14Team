The catalyst consists of SnO2 grains covered with W(VI) octahedra organized as in heteropolyacids. Its acidity is lower than the acidity of heteropolyacids but higher than that of the analogous catalyst WO3/ZrO2. The catalyst exhibits a high activity when used in the liquid phase acid-catalyzed reactions, but a part of it is washed out by polar solvents or substrates. Keywords Tungstated zirconia Tungstated tin dioxide Catalysis by solid acid 1 Introduction Catalysts consisting of 10–45 wt.% WO3 supported on ZrO2, SnO2, etc., are solid acids actively investigated and used in acid-type catalysis during the last years ([1–5] and references therein). These catalysts are usually prepared by impregnating Zr or Sn hydroxide with (NH4)6H2W12O40 solution followed by calcination at 600–1000°C. Materials containing 11–20% WO3/(ZrO2 or SnO2), calcined at 800–850°C possess the highest acidity and surface area of 30–60 m2/g. There is a variety of works focused on the studies of WO3/ZrO2, but only one work concerning WO3/SnO2 [1]. Here, we report the synthesis and study of the solid acid catalyst 30 wt.% WO3/SnO2. 2 Experimental Unlike the usual method [1–5], we have synthesized the WO3/SnO2 catalyst starting from homogeneous aqueous solutions containing Sn(IV) and W(VI). SnCl2+H2O2, SnSO4+H2O2, H2SnO3 were used as sources of Sn(IV). Heteropolyacids H3PW12O40 and H4SiW12O40, peroxometatungstate acid H6H2W12O40−x(O2)x (prepared by electrodialysis of Na2WO4 solution in the presence of H2O2 by method similar to that for heteropolyacids [6]), (NH4)6H2W12O40 were used as sources of W(VI). The solution was evaporated to dryness, the resulting solid was calcined in air. The materials for catalytic experiments were: tetrahydrofurane of polymerization grade, acetic anhydride (97%), l-sorbose (98%), acetone (99.5%), 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone (98%), isophytol (Rhone-Poulenc, 91%). For instrumental studies IR-spectrophotometer Specord 75IR, NMR-spectrometer Bruker MSL-400, XRD-spectrometer HZG-4C, derivatograph Q-1500D MOM were used. For catalytic testing, three liquid phase reactions were carried out: (1) sorbose acetonation l-sorbose+acetone→2,3-acetonesorbose→2,3;4,6-diacetonesorbose (conditions as in Ref. [7], catalyst loading 0.75 g), (2) homopolymerization of tetrahydrofurane: tetrahydrofurane+H2O or Ac2O→polyTHF (60°C, 5 h, catalyst loading 30% on THF), (3) synthesis of α-tocopherol (vitamin E): trimethylhydroquinone+isophytol→α-tocopherol (see Table 1 for conditions). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and catalysis Optimal conditions for the WO3/SnO2 catalyst were determined by catalytic testing in reaction (1). The best catalyst was 30% WO3/SnO2 prepared from H6H2W12O40−x (O2) x and SnCl2+H2O2 and calcined at 800°C for 6–8 h. S=70 m2/g. Similar properties were demonstrated by 50% WO3/SnO2 made from H6H2W12O40−x (O2) x and SnSO4+H2O2, S=55 m2/g. Product yield was up to 92% of theoretical diacetonesorbose yield. However, according to 13C NMR the product consisted of only 30% diacetonesorbose and 70% of monoacetonesorbose. Monoacetonesorbose produced was not the 2,3-isomer but, probably, the 1,2-isomer which can hardly be further acetonated. If the second step of reaction (1) was carried out, 2,3;4,6-diacetonesorbose with yield ~100% was produced. Thus, WO3/SnO2 catalyst showed its ability to catalyze liquid phase acid-catalyzed reactions, but step one in reaction (1) was nonselective. Unlike in the case of heteropolyacid catalysts, with 30% WO3/SnO2, reaction (2) did not proceed in the presence of water. In the presence of Ac2O, polytetramethyleneglycolediacetate was produced in 44% yield (thermodynamic maximum at 60°C) as with HClO4 as catalyst. In reaction (3), the yield of the target product was up to 81% (Table 1). The catalyst can be regenerated by calcining in air after each experiment without loss of its activity. 3.2 Study of the catalyst 30% WO3/SnO2 The catalyst was studied by a number of methods. According to solid state 117Sn NMR and X-ray powder diffraction, Sn existed as SnO2 particles of average size ~10 nm, and W was not detected. There were some bands in the IR-spectrum at 700–1000 cm−1 (Fig. 1) which were very usual in the spectra of octahedral W(VI) constructing heteropolyacids. The catalyst was soluble a little up to 1.5% (of its initial weight) in water and 0.1% in polar solvents during catalytic reactions. Moreover, the soluble phase was enriched with W, and the IR-spectrum of this phase (Fig. 1) corresponded to one of the Keggin-type heteropolyacids such as H6H2W12O40 or H3PW12O40, with SnO2 admixture. On the whole, we have concluded that the catalyst 30% WO3/SnO2 consists of SnO2 grains covered with WO6 octahedra organized as in heteropolyacids, as have been found for the catalyst WO3/ZrO2 [2,3]. Such a structure may be responsible for the high acidity characteristic of heteropolyacids. The acidity of the catalyst was not measured by indicator method because of brown-grey coloring. So we studied its acidity by thermoprogrammed desorption of pyridine adsorbed from benzene solution. There was the band at 1540 cm−1 in the IR-spectrum of adsorbed pyridine which indicated the Brönsted-type acid centres, and Lewis centres were not found. Under heating at the rate 10°/min, Py was removed up to 520°C. Two maxima at 415°C and 480°C appeared in the DTA curve. The amount of acid centres was 2.9 μmol/m2. For comparison, pyridine was removed from 10–14% WO3/ZrO2 at 350–400°C [8], 18% WO3/ZrO2 possessed 1.9 μmol/m2 of acid centres [4]. From heteropolyacid H3PW12O40, adsorbed pyridine was removed up to 600°C, maxima at 475°C and 560°C appeared in the DTA curve. Thus, the catalyst 30% WO3/SnO2 is somewhat more acidic than WO3/ZrO2 but somewhat less acidic than H3PW12O40. 4 Conclusions The reusable catalyst 30%WO3/SnO2 is a strong solid acid analogous to WO3/ZrO2. It consists of SnO2 grains covered with heteropolyacid-like structure of W(VI) octahedra. The catalyst can be used in the gas or liquid phase acid-catalyzed reactions combining with nonpolar solvents not leaching heteropolyacids.
