KELLER* and L. SZTERENBERG Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroctaw, 50-383 Wroclaw (Poland) (Received November 7, 1988; accepted February 27, 1989) Summary The dialkoxydinitrosylmolybdenum complexes {Mo,(NO)2(OR)2}n (R = i-Pr, Et), {Mo(NO)2(OR)2S}n (R = Et, S = EtOH; R = Me, S = MeCN) and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(OPPh3)}2 with EtAlC^ form systems catalyticaUy active in olefin metathesis. Studies on their reactions and measurements of IR spectra (in the r(NO) region) of catalytic systems revealed the sub- sequent formation stages of the catalyticaUy essential carbenemolybdenum complexes. The electronic structure of the dinitrosylmolybdenum deriva- tives, essential in the catalytic cycle of metathesis, were EHT investigated. The calculations were performed for the model system with Mo(NO)2Cl2- (PPh3)2 as precatalyst. Introduction The so-called carbene mechanism proposed by Herisson and Chauvin in 1970 [1] is commonly accepted for the olefin metathesis reaction, and has been well documented by broad, detailed investigations [2-6]. The active catalysts of metathesis could be the high-valent (d ) or the low-valent (oxida- tion state zero) complexes, e.g. Schrock alkylidene complexes [7 - 9] or Casey carbene complexes [10-12], respectively. The metathesis reactions have also been suggested to be initiated by Schrock-type carbyne complexes only [13]. For a case in which the catalytic systems are based upon nitrosyi precatalysts, the structure of complexes initiating that catalytic cycle is not resolved unequivocally. The d^y2 configuration of the central ion (Mo and W), among others, is believed to be essential for catalytic action [14]. This condition is obeyed by e.g. nitridocarbenemolybdenum(IV) complexes [15], which could also be formed from nitrosyi precatalysts. Recently, polynitrosylmolybdenum complexes of the type Mo(NO)n(HS04)n (n = *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$350 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 208 3, 4) were obtained [16]. With EtAlC^ they form active heterogeneous catalytic systems for the metathesis reaction. In these systems the Mo NO fragments are preserved [17]. We now report the results of the examination of metathesis reactions in which the dialkoxydinitrosylmolybdenum com- plexes {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n, {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)},,, {Mo(NO)2- (OR)2(OR)2}2 (R=Et, i-Pr) and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(OPPh3)}2 were used as precatalysts. The IR spectroscopic results (in the r(NO) region) of their interactions with EtAlCl2 are also presented. These results allowed us to characterize the complexes involved in the subsequent stages of the catalytic metathesis process. Their electronic structures were EHT (Extended Hiickel Theory) investigated. The calculations were performed for the model system with Mo(NO)2Cl2(PP\"3)2 as precatalyst. Experimental Starting materials All reactions were carried out in a dried and purified argon atmosphere, using vacuum-line procedures. Solvents were purified and distilled under argon from appropriate drying agents. Complexes used as precatalysts {Mo(NO)2(OR)2)n (R=Et, i-Pr), {Mo(NO)2(OR)2S}n (R = Me, S = MeCN and R = Et, S = EtOH) and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(OPPh3)}2 were prepared by published methods [18] and their purity was verified by elemental analyses. Metathesis reactions The experimental procedures for all metathesis reactions are analogous. Generally, the following method was applied: molybdenum complex (2.5 X 10~4 mol) and chlorobenzene were placed in the reaction vessel and cooled to below 0 C. Into this solution the EtAlCl2 in chlorobenzene was injected. The catalyst formation reaction was generally allowed to proceed for 15-60 min (fJ at adequate temperature (Tg). Next, if Ta = T, (Tr = metathesis reaction temperature), the temperature of the catalyst solution changed and pentene-2 was added. The samples taken after the appropriate reaction time (tr) were hydrolyzed (to inhibit the reaction) and analyzed by GLC. From the {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)},. and {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n systems a brown precipitate settled out; after 24 h it was filtered off, washed with hexane and dried in vacuo. Elemental analysis.

GLC analyses were performed on a chromatograph N-503 (Elpo). ^ NMR spectra were measured on a Tesia BS 567A spectrometer. Results and discussion Precatalysts The molybdenum nitrosyi complexes the mononitrosyi, e.g. Mo(NO)- ClaLz [19,20] and Mo(NO)d(CO)2L2 [21]; dinitrosyi, e.g. Mo(NO)2Cl2L2 [22, 23] and those containing a greater number of coordinated NO groups, e.g. Mo(NO)n(HS04^ (n = 3, 4) [17] and Mo(NO)g(BF4)s [24] equally, are unusually effective precatalysts for the metathesis reaction. The same applies to the newly synthesized dialkoxydinitrosylmolybdenum com- plexes [18]: {Mo(NO)2(OR)2}n (R=Et,i-Pr), {Mo(NO)2(OR)2S},. (R = Et, S=EtOH and R = Me, S = MeCN) and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(OPPh3)}2. They are formed in reactions of dicationic dinitrosylmolybdenum complexes with I^ORtM^LiorNa): 20R~ [Mo(NO)2(MeN02)4]2+ > Mo(NO)2(OR)2 (1) (R = bulky groups) 20R ^1 A [Mo(NO)2S4]2-1- -^ Mo(NO)2(OR)2S ^ Mo(NO)2(OR)2 (2) b (R = n-alkyi groups, S = solvent) 20R~ [Mo(NO)2S2L2]2+ \" Mo(NO)2<OR)2L (3) All the complexes discussed here are polymers, excepting the dimer {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(OPPh3)}2. {Mo(NO)2(0-i-Pr)2} is a tetramer and {Mo- (NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)} an octamer. All other complexes are more highly polymerized. The IR spectra of all these complexes exhibit two strong bands in the v(W) region (t^(NO) = 1740 -1772 cm~1 and i/as(NO) = 1605 - 1630 cm\"1) attributable to ci's-nitrosyi ligands. These complexes are easily soluble in chlorobenzene (metathesis medium), except for {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n (sparingly soluble) and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2)n (very sparingly soluble). The interaction of precatalysts with EtAlCli The multicomponent catalytic systems for metathesis reaction reach their highest activity after an induction time, (to), during which a reaction occurs between the precatalyst and cocatalyst, yielding the real catalyst. These reactions were examined by IR (in the v(NO) region) in the systems EtAlCl2-d^alkoxydmitrosylmolybdenum complexes ({Mo(NO)2(OEt)2- 210 (EtOH)} , {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)} and {Mo(NO)2(0-i-Pr)2}n), inchloro- benzene. The IR spectra of these complexes in the f(NO) range in chloro- benzene solution exhibit two bands corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of NO groups (Table 1). The effect of EtAlCl2 addition to these solutions is an immediate change in r(NO) fre- quency. The following procedure was applied. To the complex solution in chlorobenzene cooled to 40 C (Tg), the EtAlCl; solution in chlorobenzene (also at ~-40 C) was added under vigorous stirring. Reagent concentrations were the same as those used in metathesis reactions. Next, the IR spectra in the range 2000 -1500 cm~1 were recorded at ambient temperature, at fixed time intervals (tg). The same measurements were also performed for the identical systems at Ta = 25 C. In this case the reagents were mixed at 0 C and quickly heated to 25 C. The results are tabulated in Table 1. In the system {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)}n/EtAld2, at Mo/Al =1, the c(NO) fre- quencies are shifted only slightly. Increasing the aluminum alkyi concen- tration (Mo/Al = 1/8) results in substantial changes in these frequencies. Such changes for the systems with {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n and {Mo- (NO)2(0-i-Pr)2 } proceed to completion already at Mo/Al = 1/2. Increasing the EtAlCl2 concentration (Mo/Al = 1/6) causes no further shifts of f(NO). At Ta = 40 C, the systems exhibit very high stability. Their IR spectra (measured at ambient temperature) displayed four i/(NO) bands. Two of them derive undoubtedly from complexes-formed at the low temperature, the other two bands originate from complexes formed from them at ele- vated temperature. This transformation is additionally illustrated by the spectra of the systems at Ta = 25 C, in particular the system {Mo(NO)2- (0-i-Pr)2)n/EtAlCl2 where that process is rather slow. The v(W) bands of the systems with {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)} and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)}n (Ta = 25 C) undergo some shifting after a prolonged time. Their intensities decrease somewhat, because of formation of a small amount of precipitates. The IR spectra of the precipitates also exhibit two r(NO) bands. Addition of pentene-2 to all these systems (after ty, = 30 min) has no effect on the position of the v(NO) frequency (Table 1). The stability of the systems with pentene-2 also remained constant. Metathesis reaction Metathesis reactions were carried out in the classical system [22, 23], i.e. precatalyst-aluroinum alkyl-olefin in chlorobenzene (Table 2). The dialkoxydinitrosyhnolybdenum complexes were used as precatalysts, EtAlCl2 as cocatalyst and pentene-2 as the model olefin. Concentration ratios of reagents were Mo/Al = 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/6 and 1/7 and Mo/olefin = 1/400; reaction temperatures (Tr) were 35, 0 and 25 C. EtAlCl2 solution in chlorobenzene was always added to the complex solution cooled to at least 0 C under vigorous stirring. Neglecting this temperature regime resulted in considerable lowering of activity of the systems, or even to their complete deactivation, most likely due to thermal decomposition of the active cata- lyst. {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2}n> very sparingly soluble in chlorobenzene, is able to ^ ? ?i ???? ?i ? ? ? ?i? 1 o ^<io <fu3^<ia ^'m ^ ^< m i-i-^ -< c W ^rr-l ^l-l'^'r-l ^<i-l ^l ^l M <N1<C<1 ag tO t~c~ c~t~t~t~ c~r- c- t~ c~ c~c~c- ^ s & ^^ S S-S ? ?

A fa = 30 min was assumed to be sufficient time for the formation of the active complex at Ta = 25 C. As seen from Table 2, the most catalytically active system is that based upon {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n, where the thermo- dynamic metathesis equilibrium [25] was reached in less than 1 min. After several hours, with that system, a brown precipitate of dinitrosyi complex (Table 1) settled out. Increasing the olefin concentration accelerated the process. At Mo/Al = 1/6 the least active systems are those obtained from {Mo(NO)2(0-i-Pr)2}n and {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)L. The lower activity of the latter, compared with activity of the {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2}n system (Mo/ Al = 1/6), is due partially to the effectively lower concentration of EtAlCl2> whose one molar equivalent reacts with the coordinated EtOH. The activity may be enhanced by increasing the aluminum alkyi concentration (Mo/Al = 1/7). From both systems, after 24 h at T^ = 25 C, brown precipitates settled out. They are insoluble in chlorobenzene and display identical IR spectra, indicating retention of the NO ligands (Table 1). Catalyst formation and identification of intermediates in catalytic systems {Mo(NO^(ORh}n-EtAlCli and {Mo(NO)^(OR)zS}^-EtAlCl^ Studies of the metathesis reactions together with analysis of the IR spectra of the catalytic systems allowed the determination and characteriza- tion of the subsequent stages of formation of the catalytically essential carbenemolybdenum complexes. At Mo/Al = 1 neither of the studied sys- tems shows catalytic activity (Table 2). At that reagent concentration, the r(NO) frequencies of the system {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH))n/EtAlCl2 are shifted only slightly, compared with the r(NO) of the precatalyst (Table 1). In such conditions, the following reaction occurs between EtAlCl2 s ! the coordinated EtOH: Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH) + EtAlCl2 ^ Mo(NO)2(OEt)2 + Al(OEt)Cl2 + EtH (4) Reaction (4) activates the system catalytically at Mo/Al = 1/3, while the other systems are activated already at Mo/Al =1/2. The IR spectra exhibit considerable increases in r(NO), compared with the relative frequencies of precatalysts (Table 1), even at 40 C. At that temperature, adducts are formed between the precatalyst and cocatalyst in a 1:2 molar ratio. 40 C Mo(NO)2(OR)2 + 2EtAlCl2 > (EtAlCl2)2(/i-OR)2Mo(NO)2 (5) rys(NO)=1820cm-1 R=Et^ I ^s(NO) = 1710 cm-1 ri^(NO) = 1836 cm-1 R=i-Pr^ ^as(NO) = 1723 cm-1 214 40 C Mo(NO)2(OR)2L + 2EtAlCl2 > (EtAlCl2)(JLi-OR)2Mo(NO)2L (6) /ys(NO) = 1825 cm-1 R = Me, L = MeCN ^ '- ^as(NO) = 1715 cm-1 A similar 1:2 adduct arises also in the reaction between {Mo(NO)2- (0-i-Pr)2}n and AlCIa [26]. Its r(NO) frequencies (^=1828 cm-1, v^, = 1724 cm-1) are very close to those of the adduct formed in reaction (5) (R = i-Pr). For the other type of nitrosyi precatalyst, formation of the 1:2 adducts with EtAlC^ [27] and AlCIa [28] was also observed. In such adducts the Lewis acid is coordinated to. the ligand by acid-base complexa- tion [29]. The adducts formed at 40 C are very stable, but only at low tem- perature (Table 1). At elevated temperatures they most probably undergo intramolecular ethylation, followed by cc-hydrogen elimination, to produce the carbene catalysts. (EtAlCl2)2(/x-OR)2(Mo)(NO)2L > (AlCl2)2(JU-OR)2Mo(NO)2(CHCH3) + EtH (7) <ys(NO)= 1848cm-1 R = Me, Et, i-Pr \\ Las(NO) = 1744 cm-1 ^ NMR 6(EtH) = 0.79 ppm (Me4Si) The stoichiometry of reaction (7) was determined as follows: a solution of precatalyst (2.5 X 10-4 mol) and EtAlC^ (Mo/Al = 1/6) in chlorobenzene (10 ml) at 40 C was heated slowly to 25 C. During the 30 min after that temperature was reached, the liberated ethane was measured. For {Mo(NO)2- (0-i-Pr)2}n and {Mo(NO)2(OMe)2(MeCN)}n, one molar equivalent ethane was formed, while {Mo(NO)2(OEt)2(EtOH)}n yielded two molar equivalents, because of the additional course of reaction (4). The carbene complexes produced in reaction (7) are the real catalysts of the olefin metathesis reaction: H ^CH, CHCH3 ^C Mo=CHCH3 + C2:HsCH=CHCH3 5=^ Mo 5==^ Mo. .ICHCHs ^CHCHa >^ H5C2HC H 115 > Mo=CHC2H5 + CHaCH^CHCHs... (8) 215 The identical r(NO) values for the catalysts formed in reaction (7) indicate that the kind of alkoxy ligand has no effect on their electronic structure. However, their catalytic activities are very different (Table 2), and decrease in the order OMe > OEt > 0-i-Pr. Obviously, the main reason for this differ- ence is the steric structure of these ligands, which affects the ease of reaction (8). The carbene complex with R = i-Pr (reaction (7)) is unusually stable, as is indicated by the constancy of its r(NO) frequencies with time (Table 1). For the other carbene complexes (R = Me, Et), these frequencies shift. This is most likely caused by the formation of the polymeric {(AlC^z^-OR);- Mo(NO)2(CHCH3)}n, which eventually, as sparingly soluble precipitates, settle out from the catalytic systems. The IR spectra of the precipitates isolated from the olefin-free and olefin-containing systems are identical. In addition to other bands, they also display two r(NO) bands (R = Me, Vs = 1835 cm\"1, v^ = 1721 cm\"1; R = Et, ^ = 1826 cnT1, fas = 1721 cm\"1) and the bands corresponding to the ^(OR) and M C1 vibrations. The region of the r(OR) appearance (1060 -1085 cm\"!) indicates bridge coordination of the alkoxy ligands [30]. The bands in the range 255 - 315 cm~1 most likely originate from vibrations of the Mo Cl Al bridge. Elemental analysis of these precipitates revealed them to be carbene compounds with the empirical formula Mo(NO)2(OR)2(AlCl2)(CHCH3). Structure-activity relationship of nitrosyi complex catalyst for olefin metathesis; a theoretical approach The results presented in the previous paragraphs reveal clearly that the active carbene complexes formed in the multicomponent catalytic systems involving dinitrosyi precatalysts retain the nitrosyi ligands. The latter un- doubtedly exercise a basic effect on the electron density distribution in those complexes, and consequently on the nature of the Mo=:::CR2 bonding. The electronic structure of complexes involved in the catalytic cycle of the metathesis reaction, and formed from the dinitrosyi molybdenum preca- talysts, was examined by the EHT method [31] using Cusak's approxima- tion [32]. As a model for our theoretical investigations we have selected the complex Mo(NO)2Cl2(PPh3)2 (I), which in the catalytic system with alkyl- aluminum transforms into the carbene complex Mo(NO)2(PPh3)2(CH2) (II). The latter forms with olefin the metaUacyclobutane Mo(NO)2(PPh3)2(C3H<>) (III). In our calculations the atomic parameters according to [33] were used. To reduce the valence function base, the PPh3 ligand was approximated by PH3. In order to examine the stability of these complexes, the calcula- tions were performed for three representative conformations of complexes I - III, according to Fig. 1. The reason for these calculations was the pos- sibility of complexes isomeriaation; isomerization of ci's-dinitrosyi pre- catalysts has been suggested in the case of the similar tungsten system [27]. The choice of geometry was based upon the X-ray data [34], and in all cases the standard geometry of ligands was assumed [35]. 216 NO Ci | ^N0 Mo c^lY PHs la NO C^|/^ -Mo a/I^PH, NO PH, Cl Cl \\/ Mo / ^ NO NO PH, NO NO PH, CH,== Mo, / NO PH, PH, 110 I/ PH, ^ NO lib PH, CH(=MO / NO NO PH, lie NO CH; NO / \\1 / CH; Mo ^/l^ CH, PH, P\"5 Ilia NO ^ | ^ Wt Mo < / \\ CH, PH- N0 PH, NO ^\\ / CH^ ^ CH, | NO PH3 Illc Fig. 1. The geometric structures assumed for calculations of the investigated complexes. Assuming the initial Mo(NO)2Cl2(PH3)2 molecule to be neutral, the formal charges +1, 1 and 0 could be assumed for NO, Cl and PH3, respec- tively. The effective charge calculated from the electron density distribution is close to 0 for NO and PHa, and i for Cl (Table 3), which indicates the d(Mo) - 7r*(NO) interaction. Since we are comparing chemically identical systems differing only in their symmetries, the calculated total energy and the energy of the HOMO orbital may be assumed to be an approximate measure of the total energy system. Instead, from the HOMO-LUMO energy gap the stability of complexes could be concluded. Therefore the conformation Ic is slightly more favourable from an energetic point of view (Table 3). This cis-dinitrosyi precatalyst should be preferred for the forma- tion of the carbene complex. The nitrosyi ligands have empty low-localized orbitals capable of forming ir-bondings with the central ion. The chloride ligands do not have these orbitals. Hence, the d(Mo) -> TT*(NO) interactions are responsible for asymmetric distribution of a charge in the xy plane. On an orbital in that plane, molybdenum also displays the lowest electron density: d y = 0.76 < d^ = 0.81 < dy^ = 0.87.

Substitution of carbene in the xy plane on the side opposite the NO ligands should therefore require the least activation energy. The most favourable conditions also exist for the formation of the Tr(carbene) -> d(Mo) bonding. According to hypothetical considerations of the carbene complexes (Fig. 2), the most stable according to calculations (Table 5) proved to be the He isomer. Evidently, the carbene-cis-dinitrosyi (He) complex could be obtained from the cis-dinitrosyi (Ic) precatalyst. In that carbene complex, the acceptor properties of NO ligands increase compared with the initial complex. The charge on NO decreases, from 0 to 0.56, as does the positive charge on molybdenum, from +1.41 to +1.17, which indicates the n(C- carbene) -> d(Mo) interaction. The interaction of olefin with the carbene complex He causes formation of the metallacyclobutane IIIc (Table 6).

The energy distribution (fig. 4) (the lack of a minimum correspond- ing to a distorted metallacyclobutane and olefin-carbene complex) allowed us to suggest that the most stable intermediate is the carbene complex, while the olefin-carbene and metallacyclobutane complexes are less stable. These results are therefore the theoretical support for the carbene mecha- nism of the nitrosyi catalyst performance in olefin metathesis. References 1 J. L. Herisson and Y. Chauvin, Makromol.
