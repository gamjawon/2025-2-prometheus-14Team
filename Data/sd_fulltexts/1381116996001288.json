The catalytic reaction rate of the sulfite oxidation is affected by the amount of catalyst immobilized on the zeolite molecular sieve. The initial concentration of S03- influences the reaction rate. The pH value and ionic strength of the aqueous solution also very obviously influence the catalytic reaction rates. The catalysts are active in the pH range in which Fe(IVxn-TMPyP) can be generated by electrochemical method and can influence the S03- catalytic autoxidation mechanism. Fe(2-TMPyP) is more catalytically active than Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) under the same conditions. Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) are robust catalysts, while Fe(4-TMPyP) deactivates significantly. The orientation of N-methyl-pyridinium groups at the meso position of the porphyrin ring exhibit strong effects on the catalyst stability. 1. Introduction The oxidation catalyzed by supported metalloporphyrins is of interest to many field of study [1]. Supported metalloporphyrin can be used as an oxidation catalyst [2]. Metalloporphyrin oxidation catalysts have been developed which use organic or mineral supports, for example ion exchange resins [3-5], silicates [6,7], or zeolites [8,9] (de Vismes et al. used manganese porphyrin fixed on zeolite [8], Mallouk et al. used tris(byridine)ruthenium(II)-N, N'-dialkyl2,29-bipyridinium complex at the surface of a zeolite L particle [10)). Zeolites are also used to support some metal complex catalysts [11-13]. 1381-1 169/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. P11S1381-1169(96)00128-8 The oxidation of 503- is an important reaction in flue gas desulfurization. A different process of absorbing and converting sulfur dioxide into sulfate is desired and must be promoted [14,15]. Some oxidation studies using different catalysts have been investigated concerning sulfite oxidation [16]. This paper describes the heterogeneous catalytic autoxidation of sulfite by water-soluble iron porphyrins Fe( n-TMPyP) ( n = 2, 3, and 4) supported on a zeolite molecular sieve (see Fig. 1). This catalytic oxidation is in the presence of oxygen, in basic aqueous solutions. The catalytic autoxidation rate is influenced by the pH and ionic strength of the aqueous buffer solu- 278 S.-M.

This paper also reports the stability and catalytic activity for various catalysts of Fe(nTMPyP) (n = 2, 3, and 4). 2. Experimental A sample of Fe lll(2_TMPyP) was prepared according to a literature method [17,18]. Pyrrole and 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde were refluxed in propionic acid to obtain the meso-tetrakis (2pyridyl)porphyrin(HZ(2-TPyP), C4oN8H26). Methylation was achieved by reacting H 2(2TPyP) with neat dimethyl sulphate to form meso-tetrakis(N-methyl-2-pyridyl)porphyrin- ([H2(2-TMPyP)](S04CH3)-). Metallation was achieved by refluxing H 2(2-TMPyP) with FeC12 xH20 in distilled water for 10 h. [Felll(2TMPyP)]5+ was precipitated by drops of saturated NaCIO4 solution and recrystallized with water. The products were identified by their UV-visible, IR, and NMR spectra. Fe(3TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) were also synthesized by a literature method [ 17,18]. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade. Aqueous solutions were prepared with doubly distilled deionized water. Solutions were deoxygenated by purging with pre-purified nitrogen gas. Buffer solutions were prepared from H2S04, KHP, acetate, phosphate, borate, carbonate, and KOH for the pH range 0-14. The pH values were measured with a HANNA Model 8418 pH meter. Fe(n-TMPyP) catalysts were immobilized on a zeolite molecular sieve by the strong interaction between zeolite and the tetracationic iron porphyrins. A typical experiment is a 12 g zeolite molecular sieve (Aldrich, 8-12 mesh, 4 in water (90 ml), containing Fe(n-TMPyP) (10-4 M). The contents were shaken and left standing until the minimize absorbance can be measured for iron porphyrin in the aqueous solution. The immobilized catalysts were then washed with and immersed in a buffer solution. Catalytic autoxidation of sulfite by supported Fe(n-TMPyP) in the presence of oxygen was performed in a flask into which enough air bubbles have been added, and the contents have been stirred. The sulfite content is quantified by measuring the absorbance at A = 210 nm through the use of a flow system with a micro cell and a UV-visible detector. Throughout this paper the catalysts are supported on a zeolite molecular sieve. The temperature of the solutions are 25 1. Electrochemistry was performed with a Bioanalytical system (West Lafayette, IN) Model CV-27 potentiostat and a BAS X-Y recorder. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted with the use of a three-electrode cell in which a BAS glassy carbon electrode (area 0.07 cm2) was used as the working electrode. The glassy carbon electrode was polished with 0.05 Am alumina on Buehler felt pads and ultrasonicated for 1 min. The auxiliary compartment contained a platinum wire which was separated by a mediumsized glass frit. All cell potentials were taken S.-M. Chen /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 277-285 with the use of a Ag/AgCI/KC1(saturated KC1 solution) reference electrode. The ion chromatograph used in the experiments was a Dionex Instruments Ion chromatography DX-100 consisting of a pump, conductivity detector, an electrochemical detector, and a syringe loading system with 25 I,1 sample loop. The IC chromatograms were recorded using a Spectra-Physics DataJet computing integrator. The columns used throughout were an IonPac AG4A guard column, an lonPac AS4A analytical column, and a self-regenerating suppressor column. Typical LC operational parameters were as follows: mobile phase was a Na2C03 and NaHC03 buffer solution, mobile phase flow rate was 2 ml/min; the column temperature was at room temperature. These parameters were used analyzing sulfate, sulfite and thiosulfate. Thiosulfate and SZO6- were analyzed by an MPIC-NG 1 guard column, an MPIC-NS 1 analytical column, and a suppressor column. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The catalytic autoxidation of S03 - by Fe(n-TMPyP) (n = 2, 3, and 4) in homogeneous system The reaction of S03- with Fe(3-TMPyP) in a pH 9.2 borate buffer aqueous solution in the presence of oxygen is quantified by measuring the amount of sulfite absorbance at A = 210 nm by using a flow system with a micro cell and a UV-visible detector. Sulfite is oxidized to sulfate. Fig. 2 shows the changes of absorbance at 210 nm during a continuous process with only sulfite present, or with both sulfite and Fe(2TMPyP) present into which sulfite has been continuously added in intervals of a few minutes.

After Fe(3TMPyP) is added, the absorbance decreases rapidly (Fig. 2(c)). Next, sulfite is added in intervals of several minutes and reoxidized rapidly by oxygen with Fe(3-TMPyP) present as a catalyst (Fig. 2(d), (e), (f)). Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) also have similar catalytic activity in pH 9.2 borate aqueous solutions. Fe(4-TMPyP) is deactivated more easily than Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP). From the results, Fe( n-TMPyP) ( n = 2, 3, and 4) are all able to perform catalytic autoxidation of sulfite in a homogeneous system. 3.2. Fe(n-TMPyP) (n = 2, 3, and 4) supported on zeolite molecular sieve Fe( n-TMPyP) catalysts were immobilized on a zeolite molecular sieve by the strong interaction between zeolite and the tetracationic iron porphyrins. Iron porphyrin was dissolved in water, then a zeolite molecular sieve was added to the solution. The absorbance of the solutions at 350-700 nm are shown in Fig. 3. The results show that the iron porphyrin can be adsorbed onto a zeolite molecular sieve. The results also show that Fe(4-TMPyP) seems to interact with 280 lo- 051 S.-M.

The catalytic reaction rate is obviously faster than when sulfite is present with oxygen only, or with oxygen and the unsupported zeolite molecular sieve. An initial reaction rate of about 9 X 10-6 M/s was obtained by measuring the change of the sulfite concentration. The initial rate was found to increase with the rate of 02 supply. It was also influenced by the stirring rate and the 02 bubbling rate. In these experiments, the reaction rate appears nearly independent of stirring speed at more than 200 rev/min when the solution is just exposed to air. However, the experiments were performed with the stirring rate of more than 250 rev/min, and with sufficient gas bubbling. 3.4. The catalytic autoxidation of S03 - by various iron porphyrins supported on zeolite molecular sieve Fig. 5 shows the electrocatalytic autoxidation of S03- in the presence of oxygen by various supported catalysts ((Fe( n-TMPyP), n = 2, 3, and 4) in a 0.05 M borate pH 9.2 buffer solution, when the substrate is added periodically. The results show that the catalytic reaction by Fe(2-TMPyP) is faster than when using Fe(3TMPyP) or Fe(4-TMPyP) as a catalyst. The 1.0 oo 0 400 800 1200 Time, sec 1600 2000 Fig. 5.

(a) 0.0 mol/1, (b) add 1 ml zeolite molecular sieve without supporting catalyst, (c) Fe(4-TMPyP), (d) Fe(3-TMPyP), (e) Fe(2-TMPyP). S.-M. Chen/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 277-285 initial reaction rates are about 21 X 10-6, 10 X 10-6, and 9 X 10-6 M/s, respectively. Sulfite is added repeatedly some time after the substrate has mostly been exhausted. This figure shows that the sulfite added in intervals of several minutes is reoxidized rapidly by oxygen with Fe(n-TMPYP) (n = 2, 3, and 4) supported on a zeolite molecular sieve acting as the heterogeneous catalyst. Ion chromatography determined the product of the catalytic oxidation performed on a pH 9.2 aqueous solution containing sulfite, supported catalyst, and the product. After the substrate is exhausted, the product is quantified by ion chromatography. The results show that the S04 - is the only product of the catalytic oxidation of SO2- by the supported catalysts (Fe(2-TMPyP), n = 2, 3 and 4). 3.5. The stability of the catalysts Fig. 6 shows the reaction rate and the change after different turnover numbers, of the catalytic autoxidation of S03- in the presence of oxygen by various supported catalysts ((Fe(n-TMPyP), n = 2, 3, and 4) in a 0.05 M borate pH 9.2 buffer solution. The results show the stability of various catalysts after different turnover numbers. The catalytic activity from the initial reaction rate of Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) are almost the same value after a turnover number of about 15,000. This is a sulfite to sulfate turn average of 7500 by each supported catalyst molecule. Fe(4-TMPyP) shows the activity decreasing by about 40% after a turnover number of 10,000. This is a turn average of 5000 sulfite to sulfate. The results show that Fe(2-TMPyP) is more catalytically active than Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) by about 2, and 2.3 times, respectively. Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) are robust catalysts while Fe(4-TMPyP) deactivates significantly after turning 10,000 sulfite to sulfate. The results show that the orientation of the N-methyl-pyridinium groups at the meso posi- 281 30 r- h w s 20 ,h 10 -I I I 3700 7400 11110 14800 Average turnover number of per catalyst molecule Fig. 6.

Elemental analyses have been performed before and after batch experiments. No back-exchange occurs during the oxidative reaction carried out in buffer solution by measuring the absorption spectrum of iron porphyrin or adding 1,10-phenanthroline and reducing reagent. Fe(4-TMPyP) easily deactivates after turning sulfite to sulfate, but no Fe(4-TMPyP) or decompositive product back-exchange to buffer solution. 3.6. The catalytic autoxidation mechanisms We have performed the electrocatalytic oxidation of sulfite in the absence of oxygen and the catalytic autoxidation in its presence [19]. The results show that Fel\"(2-TMPYP) oxidizes to Felv(2-TMPyP) by either SOS- without oxygen, or S03- in the presence of oxygen. We have proposed a mechanism for explaining the catalytic autoxidation of S02- by water-soluble iron porphyrin. The mechanisms include: 282 S.-M. Chen /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 277-285 Felll(2_TMPyP) is reduced to Fell(2-TMPyP) by S03-, and S03- is oxidized to S03 . In the presence of oxygen, S03 reacts with OZ to rapidly produce SOS . Fell(2-TMPyP) can reduce SOS to SOS -, and SOS - can oxidize Felll(2-TMPyP) to Felv(2-TMPyP), then Felv(2-TMPyP) can oxidize S03- to S04-. In pH 9.2, the processes are as follows: Initiation: Fe,\" (2 - TMPyP) + S03- --> Fell(2 - TMPyP) + S03 (1) Propagation: (2) (3) SOS - + S03 - -> 2504 - (4) SOS + Fell (2 - TMPyP) --> Feln(2 - TMPyP) + SOS- (5) SOS- + Feln(2 - TMPyP) -* (O)Felv(2 - TMPyP) + S04- (6) 2(O)Felv(2 - TMPyP) + S03- + 2H+ -> 2Feln(2 - TMPyP) + S04- + H20 (7) The catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide by Fe'+ in aqueous solution in the presence of oxygen also has a reduction and an oxidation process [20]. Figs. 5 and 6 also show that in the first batch of the sulfite oxidation, the reaction rate is usually slower than the second or third batch. The reason may be that Fe lll(n-TMPyP) is reduced by sulfite and produces some intermediates, for example S03 ., SOS , and SOS -. Felll(n-TMPyP) is also oxidized by SOS-; and produces Felv(n-TMPyP). All of the above intermediates cause the catalytic oxidation rate of the second or third batch to have a faster initial reaction rate than the first batch. Table 1 shows the formal potential of Fe(nTMPyP) in various oxidation states. Fe(2TMPyP) has a more positive formal potential of S03 + 02 -4 S05 SOS + S03 --_> SOS + S03 Termination: Table 1 The formal potential of various iron porphyrins in pH 9.2 borate buffer solution Fe(2-TMPyP) Fe(3-TMPyP) Fe(4-TMPyP) Ref.

The formal potential of Fe(2-TMPyP) is also less positive than Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP). This is because the Felll(2TMPyP) is reduced by S03- more easily than Feln(3_TMPyP) and Feln(4-TMPyP). Also, Felll(2-TMPyP) is oxidized by SOs - more easily than Feln(3-TMPyP) and Feln(4_TMPyP). The catalytic reaction by Fe(2-TMPyP) is faster than Fe(3-TMPyP) or Fe(4-TMPyP). The initial reaction rates of the catalytic oxidation by Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) are similar. Table 1 also shows the formal potential of Fe(II/I)P. Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) have a Fe(II/I)P redox couple but Fe(4-TMPyP) does not. The electrochemistry of Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) both involve metal central reduction, but the Fe(4-TMPyP) shows ring decomposition in the potential near - 0.7 V (versus Ag/AgCI). The main cause of the deactivation of the sulfite oxidation by water-soluble iron porphyrin is the destruction of the porphyrin ring by sulfite and/or its intermediates. Both Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) are more robust than Fe(4-TMPyP) due to the lack of ring destruction. 3.7. Effects of pH The catalytic autoxidation of S03- in the presence of oxygen by Fe(2-TMPyP) is not effected by pH according to the following equation: 503- + 1/202 - 2S04- (8) 1.0 0.5 a 0 400 800 1200 Time, sec Fig. 7.

Chen /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 277-285 283 Fig. 7 shows the influence of pH on the catalytic oxidation in the presence of oxygen. Fe( n-TMPyP) ( n = 2, 3, or 4) all show the same result (Fig. 8), as the pH values of the aqueous solution decreases, the initial rate of catalytic oxidation increases significantly. If the pH < 7, the reaction rate of the catalytic oxidation decreases abnormally. The reason is that Felv(n-TMPyP) can oxidize from Fe ln(nTMPyP) only in basic aqueous solutions. This was determined from spectroelectrochemical method (21,22]. As the pH value of the aqueous solution decreases, the catalytic oxidation rate increases. The catalytic oxidation is performed through a Fetv(n-TMPyP) process. The effect of pH is significant on the sulfite autoxidation catalyzed by Fe( n-TMPyP) in the presence of oxygen. This may be explained by the interaction of support and counterion serving to sulfite, increasing its concentration near the catalyst site. 3.8. Effects of ionic strength Fig. 9 shows the reaction rate of the catalytic autoxidation of 503- in presence of oxygen by supported catalyst [(Fe(4-TMPyP)] in different ionic strengths of borate pH 9.2 buffer solutions. The data shows that the effect of an ionic strength increase is to increase the reaction rate. x o. h 0 400 800 1200 Time, sec 1600 2000 Fig. 9.

[S03- ]= 10-3 M, [supported Fe(3-TMPyP)j=2.7X-6 mol/1. 284 The effect of the ionic strength is to increase the rate of ions with charges of the same sign, and to decrease it when the charges are opposite in sign. This is a variation of a reaction rate constant which is often called the primary salt effect [23]. Fig. 10 also shows the ionic strength effect of the reaction for different catalysts. Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) also have similar results. The effect of ionic strength is obvious for the sulfite autoxidation catalyzed by Fe(n-TMPyP) in the presence of oxygen. Sulfite and a zeolite molecular sieve have charges of the same sign(negative charge), therefore the reaction rate constant increases when ionic strength is increased. 3.9.

The half-life of the substrate is almost proportional to 1/[503-]o ([S03-]o is the initial concentration of sulfite). Therefore, the reaction rate law is nearly a second order when oxygen is in enough supply and the reaction is not influenced by the stirring rate. 4. Conclusion This paper has shown that supported watersoluble iron porphyrin Fe(2-TMPyP), Fe(3TMPyP), and Fe(4-TMPyP) on the zeolite molecular sieve, act as efficient catalysts for catalytical autoxidation of sulfite in the presence of oxygen. All the catalysts have shown catalytical activity for sulfite oxidation in the pH range in which Fe1vP can be produced by electrochemical method in the absence of oxygen. The supported catalysts Fe( n-TMPyP) ( n = 2, 3, and 4) have shown the catalytic activity of S.-M. Chen /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 112 (1996) 277-285 sulfite oxidation. Fe(2-TMPyP) has a more catalytically active initial reaction rate than Fe(3TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP). The catalytic activity is influenced by the N-methyl-pyridinium group at the meso position. Fe(2-TMPyP) has a more positive formal potential of Fe(III/II)P than Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP). It was shown that Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3TMPyP) are very stable, but Fe(4-TMPyP) is easily deactivated. The porphyrin ring of Fe(4TMPyP) is easily destroyed by sulfite and/or its intermediates, just as Fe(4-TMPyP) destruction is easier in the electrochemical reduction than Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP). Ionic strength and pH of the buffer solution also influence the catalytic autoxidation rate. In pH < 7, the catalytic reaction rate decreases abnormally because FelvP only can be produced in basic aqueous solution. The catalytic autoxidation rate increases as the pH values of the aqueous solution decrease in the basic aqueous solution. In the weak basic solution, sulfite may more easily be near the catalytic site, compared to a stronger basic solution with the same ionic strength. These catalytical reactions obey the primary salt effect and show that increasing the ionic strength of the buffer solution increases the catalytic reaction rate.

The catalytic reaction rate of the sulfite oxidation is affected by the amount of catalyst immobilized on the zeolite molecular sieve. The initial concentration of SO2− 3 influences the reaction rate. The pH value and ionic strength of the aqueous solution also very obviously influence the catalytic reaction rates. The catalysts are active in the pH range in which Fe(IV)(n-TMPyP) can be generated by electrochemical method and can influence the SO2− 3 catalytic autoxidation mechanism. Fe(2-TMPyP) is more catalytically active than Fe(3-TMPyP) and Fe(4-TMPyP) under the same conditions. Fe(2-TMPyP) and Fe(3-TMPyP) are robust catalysts, while Fe(4-TMPyP) deactivates significantly. The orientation of N-methyl-pyridinium groups at the meso position of the porphyrin ring exhibit strong effects on the catalyst stability. References [1] B. Meunier Chem. Rev. 92 1992 1411 [2] D.C.
