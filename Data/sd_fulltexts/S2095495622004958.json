Graphical abstract An overview of the fundamental mechanisms and major challenges of electrical double layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, Li-ion capacitors and microscale electrochemical capacitors as well as an outlook on their future opportunities are provided. Keywords Electrochemical capacitors Electrical double layer capacitors Pseudocapacitors Li-ion capacitors Microscale electrochemical capacitors Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) with unique merits of fast charge/discharge rate and long cyclability are one of the representative electrochemical energy storage systems, possessing wide applications in power electronics and automotive transportation, etc. [1,2]. Furthermore, their ability of ECs as energy storage units to integrate with energy harvesters (e.g., solar cells, nanogenerators) and energy consumption (e.g., sensors) holds great prospects for wearable and portable electronics and self-powered systems [3–5]. The market value of global supercapacitors market was about USD 549.1 million in 2021, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 1,114.60 million by 2027 [6]. Currently, ECs develop towards the goal that is continuously improving the technologies to address the key issues associated with enhanced specific energy without sacrificing high-power density. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the fundamental mechanisms and major challenges of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors, Li-ion capacitors (LICs) and microscale ECs (MECs), and give an outlook on the future opportunities of different ECs (Fig. 1 ). Electrical double layer capacitors. EDLCs are the energy storage devices that store energy through an interfacial electrical double layer formed between physically adsorbed ions and electrodes. When EDLCs are charged, the anions and cations in electrolyte are physically adsorbed on the surface of negative and positive electrodes, respectively, and go back into the electrolyte during the discharge. EDLCs suffer from low energy density, and maximizing the charge storage ability of porous materials and widening operating voltage are the key for improving the energy density. Hierarchically porous carbons with interlinked channels and large accessible specific surface areas (SSA) are desirable to offer abundant ion adsorption sites and efficient charge transport network for boosting the charge storage. However, several factors should be taken into considerations. First, pore structure (shape, size, connectivity, etc.) is a primary parameter for the ion fluxes and electric double layer formation in nanopores. Elaborated optimization of pore structure based on the understanding of ion dynamics and electrolyte confinement effect is required to regulate the ion adsorption and transport inside porous electrodes and to realize high capacitance and rate capability. Second, the wettability of the pores is also critical to maximize the accessible SSA for charge storage, mainly affected by the surface chemistry of electrode and electrolyte. In particular, the pores with ionophobic character have been proposed to realize fast ion transport in non-aqueous electrolytes. Third, large SSA with abundant porosity generally results in large gravimetric capacitance yet low volumetric performance. Hence, a trade-off should be considered among the SSA, porosity and packing density to reconcile gravimetric and volumetric performance metrics. Fourth, low equivalent series resistance of full devices is prerequisite for achieving high-power ECs. Lastly, good processibility and affordable production cost of porous carbons are also two concerns for commercial applications. Especially the porous carbons derived from the renewable and recycled materials deserve great concerns [7,8], however, the issues related to the product repeatability, consistency of raw material, etc. need to be completely addressed in future. Considering the exponential increase of energy density with cell voltage increasing, ionic liquid (IL)-based EDLCs possess good application prospects. However, high viscosity and low ionic conductivity of ILs should be overcome to promote low temperature and fast-charging performance by strategies of regulating anions/cations, designing novel ions, mixed ILs and diluting ion concentration with other solvents. Besides, electrochemically stable interface achieved by surface passivation or constructing edge-free carbon nanostructures could effectively avoid electrolyte decomposition under high voltage. Pseudocapacitors. Pseudocapacitors store large amount of energy via fast Faradic reactions occurring on/near the surface of electrodes or through ion intercalation into electrode and exhibit electrochemical behaviors similar to those of EDLCs. Metal oxides and conducting polymers are representative pseudocapacitive materials, but limited by low conductivity, poor lifespan and small operation voltage in aqueous electrolyte. Hybridizing pseudocapacitive materials with carbon matrix or adopting high-voltage electrolytes (e.g., water-in-salt, IL) could effectively make up their deficiency. Recently, the emergence of pseudocapacitive charge storage in Li+ intercalation materials in organic electrolytes opens a new era for high energy pseudocapacitors. Intrinsic pseudocapacitance is contributed by the materials that exhibit capacitive behavior without diffusion limitation in both nano-structure and bulk particle electrodes, while extrinsic pseudocapacitance is generally from battery-type materials in nanoscale form, presenting pseudocapacitive electrochemical features [9]. Here, both intrinsic (TiO2, T-Nb2O5) and extrinsic (defective LiFePO4, nanosized LiCoO2) intercalation pseudocapacitive materials represent typical surface-controlled reaction kinetics with superior rate capability, through crystal and morphology engineering and hybridization with conductive network for pseudocapacitors. To achieve high capacity and fast-charging, one reliable strategy is to boost rapid ion diffusion in host structure and accelerate charge transfer kinetics while maintaining the abundance of redox-active sites. Representatively, introducing defects to accelerate electron transport and adjusting interlayer spacing to enhance ion transport are promising directions. Besides, it is of importance to optimize the potential of positive materials as high as possible and, correspondingly, negative electrodes working at low yet safe potential in the full cells. Li-ion capacitors. LICs merge a high-energy battery-type electrode and a fast-kinetics capacitive electrode into a single device. During the charge storage process of LICs, the energy comes from the ion adsorption on the capacitive cathode and lithium ion intercalation into the anode, respectively. However, current LICs have not yet achieved such expected “double high” goals of both energy density and power density together with long cyclability. The key solutions are to develop materials with high structural and interface stability as well as desirable electrochemical performances of large capacity, fast rate and desired average voltage, and realize a good matching of capacity and kinetics between anode and cathode. As for anodes, the effectiveness of strategies such as surface coating, SEI regulation, conductive network optimization toward fast-charge materials including hard carbon, high-rate graphite and lithium titanate have been widely demonstrated. Other types fast-charging anodes such as disordered rock salt Li3V2O5 and black phosphorus show the superiority in terms of the dendrite-free Li plating, high initial coulombic efficiency and long durability. As for cathodes, incorporating battery-type mechanism into capacitive one to form inside-parallel-type electrode can substantially enhance the bulk density and capacity of carbon-based cathodes and meanwhile widen the voltage of the whole device. Designing battery-type cathodes with capacitive power-delivery characteristics obtained through heteroatom doping, surface coating, size reduction and compositing with conductive network can efficiently accelerate their reaction kinetics to achieve excellent rate capability of LICs. Further, developing reliable cost-effective pre-lithiation strategies, together with electrochemically stable high-voltage electrolytes and functional separators should be considered to further improve the performance and safety of LICs. Microscale electrochemical capacitors. MECs are referred to a class of micropower sources with the size at the level of micrometers at least one dimension and can be integrated with other functional microelectronics to satisfy various demands. They are significantly driven by the ever-growing power requirements of microelectronics and microsystems as well as other internet-of-things. Substantial efforts have been put into achieving high electrochemical performance (high areal/volumetric energy and power densities), good flexibility, functionality and integrability of MECs. The current researches are mainly focused on developing advanced and large-scale manufacturing techniques to process high-performance microelectrode materials and functional solid/gel electrolytes into designed configurations, implement effective packaging and complete integration into micro-devices and systems. High integration of MECs and other components including energy harvester and functional devices demands deep consideration on the compatibility and the overall energy efficiency should be a key factor in determining the whole function. Further, it does not work without the concerted effort ofresearch and commercial institution to bridge the MECs with customizability and diversity into practical stage in future. Moreover, in-situ/operando characterization techniques of experiments working together with theoretical calculation is highly in demand to fundamentally understand the energy storage mechanisms at the micro- and nano-scale, and MECs offer an open and convenient dynamic mode for in-situ/operando characterizations. What is next? The energy density of EDLCs can be substantially improved by widening cell voltage and increasing capacitance of porous carbons. Reducing equivalent series resistance of the ECs is of crucial importance for boosting power density. Self-discharge causes the energy loss and drop of terminal voltage in the practical application of EDLCs. Thus, developing advanced test methods and understanding the fundamentals of self-discharge are extraordinarily necessary for adopting corresponding strategies to efficiently inhibit the self-discharge of EDLCs. Pseudocapacitive materials with fast ion transport channels and high electrical conductivity in stable host structure are highly desirable and, accordingly, fundamental mechanisms studies are indispensable to fully understand the electrochemical reaction kinetics. Selecting suitable pseudocapacitive materials and electrolytes together with reasonable device configurations is expected to obtain high energy density and power density. Currently, most LICs stay in an embarrassing situation of improving the energy density yet sacrificing power density. Therefore, LICs that catch up with the energy delivery amounts of battery while maintaining high power characteristic and cyclability of EDLCs will be widely accepted, the key of which is to obtain matched high-energy and high-power electrode materials and electrolytes as well as advanced prelithiation technologies based on the designed device configurations. The emerging MECs with multifunctionalities are proposed, which requires the synergy of advanced electrode materials, customized electrolytes, structural patterns, high-resolution microfabrication technologies and effective packaging. Additionally, high-performance all-solid-state ECs should be further developed to avoid safety issues and reduce self-discharge problems in practical applications. With the continued concern of carbon neutrality, it is believed that ECs will make great contribution to automotive transportation, energy acquisition, instantaneous braking, backup power supply and other fields in our society.
