Graphical abstract The formed C-F bond not only optimizes the nucleation/decomposition of Li2O2, but also acts as an e− highway for deliation, thus providing low over-potential and good stability of the battery. Li-O2 batteries provide an attractive and potential strategy for energy conversion and storage with high specific energy densities. However, large over-potential in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) caused by the decomposition obstacles of Li2O2 seriously impedes its electrochemical performances. Herein, a novel N, O, S and F co-doping vesicular carbon was prepared by self-template pyrolysis method and used in Li-O2 battery to tune the nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2. The introduction of F in the carbon matrix with suitable content can regulate the adsorption of intermediates, through which the morphology of Li2O2 can be controlled to film, favorable to its decomposition in charge process. The cathode based on the optimized F doped carbon vesicle exhibits improved electrochemical performances including a low over-potential, large capacity and a long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that F and C in C–F bond hasve a strong interaction to Li and O in Li2O2, respectively, which can enhance the transfer of electrons from Li2O2 to the carbon matrix to generate hole polaron and thus accelerate the delithiation and decomposition of Li2O2. This work provides a new sight into understanding the mechanism of nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2 for the development of high-performance Li-O2 batteries. Keywords Li-O2 batteries F-doped carbon vesicles DFT Li2O2 nucleation and decomposition 1 Introduction Compared with other potential secondary battery systems, rechargeable Li-O2 batteries with the highest theoretical energy density (3600 Wh kg−1) have received extensive attention [1–3]. In an ideal scenario, the discharge and charge reaction of the Li-O2 battery operates through reversible formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface [2]. However, because of the high energy barrier of delithiation process of Li2O2, the reaction kinetic of the charge process is sluggish, which is mainly caused by the inefficient charge transfer and poor contact between Li2O2 and cathode [4]. The surface electronic states and pore structure can influence the affinity of O2 and intermediate LiO2 to the cathode, thus affect the morphology/distribution of discharge product and its interface charge transfer to the cathode [5–7]. Therefore, designing reasonable cathode materials with suitable pore and electronic structure to regulate the interface action between Li2O2 and cathode is of great importance to enhancing the performances of Li-O2 battery [8–16]. Due to the inherent advantages including the excellent conductivity, tunable electronic and pore structures, metal-free carbon materials have been widely studied in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [17–20], such as commercial carbon (super P), carbon nanotubes, graphene and these obtained from biomass or special organic precursors. In order to further improve the catalytic activity of the carbon substrates, various physical and chemical modifications including the design of specific defect [21], introducing inorganic/organic groups [22] and heteroatom doping [23–26] have been applied. Among them, heteroatom doping is currently the most widely studied and efficient method due to the unexpected electrochemical properties which can be obtained by the charge redistribution based on the electronegativity difference between carbon and the heteroatoms [27–30]. Esrafili et al. demonstrated that carbon material doped with N exhibited surprising ORR catalytic activity through the chemisorption of O2, which was directly related to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the N atom [31]. The charge redistribution caused by the introduction of doping atoms can not only make themself act as effective catalytic sites, but also improve the catalytic activity of adjacent carbon atoms. For instance, the N2 molecule can be adsorbed on the two carbon atoms in the contrapuntal sites of the fluorine dopants, through which the N–N bond length was sharply increased, therefore the F-doped carbon exhibits increased N2 reduction reaction performance [32]. In addition, by using suitable precursor compound, doping heteroatoms and improved pore structure can be achieved simultaneously via the evolution of gas or some removable substances in the pyrolysis process, leading to the increased exposure amount of catalytic sites and mass transfer channels [33,34]. At present, although there are few heteroatom doped carbon materials reported in Li-O2 battery field, they all exhibit attractive performances. For example, Han et al. [35] reported that N, S doping graphene with 3D bicontinuous porous configuration can dramatically promote the electrochemical reaction kinetics for rechargeable Li-O2 batteries. Wong et al. [36] demonstrated that the O-doped carbon nanotube can improve the discharge capacity, charge over-potential and cycle stability of Li-O2 batteries due to the enhance affinity of intermediate LiO2 to the cathode. Although a range of heteroatom doping such as B, N, O, P and S were reported [35–38], doping carbon with F has not been reported in Li-O2 battery. With the semi-ionic C–F bonds derived from the high electronegativity of F, F-doped carbons become an acidic character and behave as electron acceptors, facilitating the enhancement of electron transfer ability [39–42]. Inspired by this perspective, herein, F was introduced into a carbon matrix together with N, O, S to construct porous carbon vesicles structure and tune the nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2 in Li-O2 battery. The appropriate content F doping with semi-ionic C–F bonds exhibits superior performances such as a low charge over-potential of 0.51 V and a long-term stability of 187 cycles. What is more, the morphology of Li2O2 can be tuned to film like through controlling the content of F, which is favorable for the decomposition of Li2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that F and C in C–F bond have a strong binding force to Li and O in Li2O2, respectively, which can enhance the charge transfer from Li2O2 to carbon matrix, and promote the delithiation process of Li2O2, thus significantly reduce the charge energy barrier. This work provides a new sight into the rational design and synthesis of metal free carbon materials for Li-O2 batteries, and contributes to the understanding of the mechanism of Li2O2 nucleation and decomposition, which is crucial for the development of high-performance Li-O2 batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (TFTA) with a certain amount (0, 100, 200 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL ethanol to make solution A. 1 mL H2O was added into 1 g sodium pyrithione (SPT) aqueous solution (40 wt%) as solution B. Then solution A was dropwise added into solution B, and the obtained mixture solution was evaporated at 100 °C to get the solid precursor. Subsequently, a heat treatment of the solid precursor was done at 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere. Finally, the carbonized materials were washed with H2O for three times, and dried in an oven. 2.2 Li-O2 battery assembly The mixture of catalyst materials and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 9:1 was added into N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and grounded to make a slurry. The slurry was coated on carbon paper substrate, and dried in an oven at 80 °C to obtain cathodes. Using a clean lithium sheet as the anode, a glass-fiber as the separator, and 1.0 mol L−1 lithium triflate/tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether as the electrolyte, Li-O2 batteries were assembled in a glove box under a high-purity Ar atmosphere, and the contents of O2 and H2O are both less than 0.1 ppm. 2.3 Physical and eletrochemical characterization The crystalline phases of the prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-K α radiation. The thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were investigated by STA 409 PC Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were conducted on an Agilent UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000). The morphology and surface structure were observed by Zeiss SIGMA 500 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and JEM-2100 (HR) transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The composition and valence state of the carbon materials were performed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250 Xi). The specific surface area and pore size distribution of materials were recorded on the TriStar II 3020 specific surface area analyzer. The Raman spectra of samples were determined by Renishaw Invia Raman spectroscopy. Gas analysis was observed by I-DEMS 100 mass spectrometer and Agilent 7820A in situ gas chromatography (GC) system. The electrochemical performances of Li-O2 batteries were measured with LAND CT-2001A and CHI660E electrochemical workstation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization of precursors and catalysts As illustrated in Scheme 1 , N, O, S and F doped carbon vesicles were obtained by pyrolyzing the precursor formed from SPT and TFTA and followed by washing with H2O. During the pyrolysis process, Na2S and Na2O were generated together with carbon and acted as hard templates for the construction of porous carbon materials. TFTA with different amounts (0, 100 mg, 200 mg) were used to tune the content of doped F, and the corresponding precursors and products were denoted as SPT, SPT-100, SPT-200 and 0 FC, 100 FC, 200 FC, respectively. The precursors were obtained based on the reaction of SPT with TFTA in the mixture of H2O and ethanol (Scheme 1), interestingly, the formed precursors display an appearance from light yellow to yellow in sequence of SPT-100, SPT-200, different from the white color of SPT and TFTA (Fig S1a). From the XRD patterns of SPT, TFTA, SPT-100, SPT-200 (Fig. S1b), it can be seen that both the SPT-100 and SPT-200 show only the characteristic diffraction peaks of SPT, and the intensity of the main diffraction peak at 2θ = 6.7° is reduced in the sequence of SPT, SPT-100 and SPT-200. To verify this trend, XRD pattern of the sample with SPT to TFTA mole ratio of 2:1 and the carboxyl/Na+ mole ratio of 1:1 (denoted as SPT-320) is observed and shows that all the diffraction peaks are disappeared (Fig. S1c). The above results indicate that when SPT was mixed with TFTA, the interaction between them resulted in the formation of gradually raised amorphous precursors with increasing the amount of TFTA, along which the amount of SPT left in the formed precursor is reduced and disappeared in SPT-320. In order to explain the interaction mechanism of SPT and TFTA, a structure model was established by molecular dynamics simulation method. Since the aqueous solution of SPT is alkaline, thus SPT hydrolyzed and generated pyrithione and NaOH in H2O, and the neutralization reaction occurred first when it was mixed with TFTA. As shown in Scheme 2 , there is an ordered face to face arrangement between SPT (pyrithione) and TFTA (tetrafluoroterephthalate anion), and Na+ plays an important role in locking the conformation of the two molecules [43]. The absorption wavelength of this TFTA-Na+-SPT moiety was calculated to be 576.8 nm, which is near to that of determined value (598 nm) for SPT-320 (Fig. S2), verifying the rationality of the established model. The generation of TFTA-Na+-SPT network in precursor is favorable for the uniform dispersion of templates in their subsequent formation process (vide infra). The morphology of the obtained carbon materials was studied by SEM as shown in Fig. 1 . Without the addition of TFTA, the 0 FC exhibits a block structure with discontinuous holes (Fig. 1a and b), while the 100 and 200 FC display a packing architecture composed of stacked box-like vesicles (Fig. 1c–f). The change in construction suggests that the introduction of TFTA has a regulatory effect on the morphology of carbon products. In order to understand this, the self-template formation of F doped carbon vesicles through the pyrolysis of precursors was studied. The SEM images of 0, 100 and 200 FC before washing present a cubic or polyhedron structure (Fig. S3), and the corresponding XRD patterns of the two samples show that most of the peaks belong to Na2S and Na2O except for the inconspicuous peaks of NaHCO3·10H2O (may be derived from the reaction of Na2S and Na2O with H2O and CO2 in the air) and C (Fig. S4). The decomposition behavior of precursors was studied by thermogravimetric and DSC analyses (Fig. 1g–i). It can be seen that the temperature for the first endothermic peak of SPT-100 and SPT-200 decreases and the corresponding weight loss increases obviously compared to pure SPT sample, indicating that the interaction of SPT with TFTA leads to the ahead of time for the thermal decomposition process of the precursor [26]. The early decomposition of precursor induces the prior generation of solid templates, which is conducive to the subsequent formed carbon being wrapped on the solid template. Importantly, the formation of TFTA-Na+-SPT network made the solid templates generated and dispersed in the system uniformly; therefore, with the morphology inducement of the template, the formed carbon materials take the structure of vesicles after removing the templates. SEM image of the 320 FC derived from SPT-320 precursor was also investigated and found that its surface pores were smaller, as shown in Fig. S5, indicating that the generated solid products were more dispersed and the size was further reduced. As a result, the morphology of obtained carbon material changed from bulk into stacked box-like vesicles, which not only provides more channels for discharge product accumulation and exposes a large number of potential active sites, but also facilitates the mass transfer of reactants or/and products. After being washed with H2O, only the peaks of C can be observed in the XRD patterns of pyrolysis products (Fig. 2 a), further Raman spectrum reveals that the three carbon materials deliver two characteristic peaks at 1332.9 cm−1 (D-band) and 1604.3 cm−1 (G-band) as shown in Fig. 2(b). The I D/I G values decrease with the sequence of 0 FC (1.13), 100 FC (1.02) and 200 FC (1.01), indicating the better degree of carbonization with the introduction of F, which is beneficial to improve the electrical conductivity and structure stability of carbon [41]. To investigate the binding state of F in the synthesized 100 and 200 FC materials, XPS characterization was employed. Clearly, semi-ionic and ionic C–F bonds are dominated in 100 and 200 FC as shown in Fig. 2(c and d), respectively. As the biggest contributor to optimizing the electrochemical performance of carbon, the semi-ionic C–F bond has been considered to own the desired character for most fluorinated carbon materials [39]. Especially, the semi-ionic C–F bonds enable the F-doped carbon as electron acceptors, facilitating the enhancement of electron transfer ability and electrochemical reaction kinetics [39]. However, when the C–F bond exhibits the charactristic of ionic one, the interaction between C and F atoms is weak (Fig. 2e), and thus the carbon atoms is close to sp 2 type leading to sluggish charge transfer ability between F and C matrix [39]. The contents of F based on the XPS results in 100 and 200 FC are 0.35 at% and 0.51 at%, respectively. 3.2 Electrochemical performances of the cathodes The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out to study the fundamental effect of F doping on the ORR/OER performances of Li-O2 battery. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the 100 FC cathode delivers much higher ORR onset potential and lower OER onset potential in the three cathodes during the cathodic/anodic sweep, respectively, indicating that suitable F doping plays a critical role in ameliorating both the ORR and OER voltage gap. Moreover, higher ORR and OER peak current and integral areas can be observed in the 100 FC catalyzed battery, demonstrating that suitable F doping can promote facile generation of Li2O2 and induce more Li2O2 to be decomposed reversibly, which is verified by further discharge/charge tests [44,45]. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the battery with 100 FC cathode shows the highest discharge potential and lowest charge potential among the three cathodes at a cut-off capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 with a constant current density of 150 mA g−1. The full discharge capacity for the three cathodes was tested as shown in Fig. 3(c), battery with 100 FC cathode yields a high discharge capacity of 18230 mAh g−1 at the current density of 150 mA g−1, and can still display a satisfactory capacity over 6000 mAh g−1 under a high current of 450 mA g−1 (Fig. S6). In contrast, batteries with 0 and 200 FC cathodes deliver the lower discharge capacity of 8629 and 12913 mAh g−1, respectively, suggesting the superior catalytic activity of 100 FC for ORR. In order to deeply understand the influence of F on battery performance, 100 FC material with optimal electrochemical kinetics was selected for further performance characterization. The rate performance of battery with 100 FC cathode is shown in Fig. 3(d), though the over-potential slightly increases with the increase of current density, the charge potential is still below 4.0 V at the high current density of 450 mA g−1. In the cycling process, the battery based on 100 FC cathode exhibits stable discharge–charge potential curves up to 187 cycles at a current density of 150 mA g−1 with a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g−1 (Fig. 3e), in contrast, for 0 and 200 FC catalyzed batteries, the cycling can last for only 83 and 94 cycles, respectively, as shown in Fig. S7. The discharge/charge potentials corresponding to the different cycle numbers of the three cathodes are given in Fig. 3(f), which shows that 100 FC cathode exhibits better and stable discharge/charge voltages compared to 0 and 200 FC cathodes during the cycling. In addition, it can be seen that when the amount of TFTA increased to 300 mg, the performance of 300 FC showed a significantly declined ORR/OER activity which is inferior than 0 FC (Fig S8). Therefore the performance of 200 and 300 FC showed a consistent tendency with the increase of TFTA. All of the results above indicate that the electrochemical performances are remarkably related to the introduction of F, by doping suitable F into the carbon matrix, the performance of the battery can be significantly improved. The contents of these heteroatoms in 100 FC based on the XPS results were showed in Table S1. In addition, it is believed that N, O, S have synergistic effects with F, based on relevant reports, multiple doping often shows better performance due to the complex charge redistribution and different special effects of each elements [27,30]. For example, N, O and F are more electronegative than C, and they can induce various degrees of charge redistribution on nearby C atoms, while S can effectively change the spin density of C [30]. 3.3 The micro and pore structure of 100 FC material To understand the microstructure and component of the formed vesicles in the prepared carbon materials, 100 FC material was studied with Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersed X-ray spectrometry (EDX). As depicted in Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. S9, box-like vesicles are stacked together, which is in accordance with the morphology given by SEM (Fig. 1c and d), and the thickness of 100 FC vesicles is about 7.3 nm (Fig. 4a). The HRTEM in Fig. 4(b) further reveals that the surface of the vesicles is composed of thin needle-like particles which are cross-linked, giving rise to porous structures. EDX mapping indicates that C, N, O, S and F elements are homogenously distributed in the vesicles (Fig. 4c). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were performed to investigate specific surface area and porosity structure. A typical IV isotherm shape is displayed as shown in Fig. S10, corresponding to the fine porous structure observed by the SEM and TEM [35], and the calculated specific surface area is 845.6 m2 g−1, much higher than that of 0 FC (321.4 m2 g−1). The high surface area provides more active sites for ORR/OER, and porous structure facilitates the transfer of Li+ and O2, which is beneficial for the homogeneous nucleation and deposition of Li2O2 [2,46–48]. 3.4 Investigations of discharge products on the cathodes To understand the nucleation and decomposition process of Li2O2 and give insights into why the electrochemical performances of 100 FC cathode is superior to that of 0 and 200 FC, the morphology of initial discharged products on the three cathodes is investigated by SEM. After discharging to 1000 mAh g−1, rod-like Li2O2 can be seen on the surface of 0 FC as shown in Fig. 5 (a), which is consistent with previous reports that Li2O2 can grow continuously in the (0001) direction on some special cathode surface to form nanorod or nanowire morphology [49]. Concretely, the geometric top and bottom surfaces of the rod-like product are (0001) plane, according to the standard Wulff shape model of Li2O2, the side plane on which the nanorod is in contact with the 0 FC surface should be the (1120) surface [50,51]. However, both the rod and nanowire-like Li2O2 have the problem of limited contact area with the cathode, which is unfavorable to the charge transfer. In contrast, film-like Li2O2 with granular inclusion is uniformly dispersed on the surface of 100 FC, and thus a tight interface contact between Li2O2 and the cathode can be achieved (Fig. 5b). It has been widely recognized that the increased O2/LiO2 adsorption sites can inhibit the movement of crystal seeds and facilitate the multi-site nucleation of Li2O2, which is conducive to the formation of film-like homogeneous Li2O2 on the cathode [5]. Larger-sized toroid Li2O2 with obvious exposed (0001) plane are observed on the 200 FC cathode (Fig. 5c), indicating the different ORR path of 200 FC, which may be due to the feature of ionic C–F bonds. The interaction between C and F atoms is weak in ionic C–F bond [39], therefore, transferring charge from carbon matrix to Li+/O2 through the C–F bond is difficult and the formation of Li2O2 will be sluggish during discharge, leading to heterogeneous nucleation and the formation of larger-sized Li2O2 [5,47]. From the results above, compared with the toroids and rod-like Li2O2, the formation of film-like discharge product on 100 FC can increase the contact area with the cathode and enhance Li+/e− transfer ability, which is favorable for decomposition of Li2O2 and facilitates to reduce the charge over-potential [5,50,51]. As analyzed above, the rod-like and toroidal products all show an identifiable (0001) plane related to the Li2O2 crystal, in order to confirm the film-like product on 100 FC cathode, XRD pattern of the discharged 100 FC cathode were further studied. Fig. S11 is the corresponding XRD patterns of the discharged 100 FC cathode, no peaks belonging to Li2O2 or Li2CO3 appears at the discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g−1, suggesting that Li2O2 nanoparticles generated on 100 FC cathode may be amorphous at this discharge depth. When the discharge capacity increased to 5000 mAh g−1, broad peaks at 33° and 35° are observed, indexing to the (100) and (101) facets of Li2O2, respectively, illustrating the poor crystallinity of Li2O2 on 100 FC even at the large discharge capacity. Li2O2 with poor crystallinity is recognized to be favorable for its decomposition due to the enhanced Li+/e− transfer ability [5,36], after recharging at a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g−1, most of the discharge products are decomposed and the porous vesicular structure of 100 FC with neat surface can be observed again (Fig. S12a). The corresponding in situ DEMS test was further applied to study the decomposition products on 100 FC cathode, only the evolution of O2 gas is detected as displayed in Fig. S12(b), and the charge-to-mass ratio is determined to be 2.05 which is close to the theory value based on the reversible reaction of 2Li + + O 2 + 2e - ↔ Li 2 O 2 , illustrating the completely decomposition of Li2O2. 3.5 Theoretical analysis to understand the mechanism of charge process To investigate the detailed Li2O2 nucleation state on the C–F bond of 100 FC and shed light on the underlying interface mechanism of Li2O2 decomposition process, a DFT study was conducted and Fig. S13 shows the initial state of F doped carbon matrix. Fig. 6 (a) and Fig. S14(a) reveal that F can easily anchor Li in (Li2O2)2 through the coulombic force, and the adsorption energy E ads of (Li2O2)2 on F atom is −2.75 eV, electron can be easily transferred through the Li-F-C pathway to the cathode, promoting the delithiation of Li2O2 in charge process. Meanwhile, the binding force between O atom in (Li2O2)2 and C atom in C–F bond is also large with a adsorption energy E ads of −5.34 eV. The strong interaction enables electron to be easily transferred from Li2O2 to the conductive C substrate through O@C interface directly without the participation of other intermediate atoms during the charge process (Fig. 6b and Fig. S14b). Recently, Wang et al. has revealed that the interfacial charge transfer barriers (eU/ΔH ICT) through the interface of Li2O2 and cathode corresponding to the delithiation reaction ( Li 2 O 2 - e - - Li + ↔ LiO 2 ) are the major origin of charge over-potential [4]. Therefore, in addition to the good contact between Li2O2 and cathode with the formation of film like Li2O2, the lower interfacial charge transfer potential (U ICT) achieved by regulation action of C–F bond plays an important role in accelerating the decomposition of Li2O2 during the charge process. Subsequently, the corresponding energy barrier reducing mechanism compared with the intrinsic decomposition process of Li2O2 is illustrated in Fig. 6(c and d), respectively, and the separation of holes and electrons at the interface of Li2O2@cathode represents the delithiation reaction of Li2O2. 4 Conclusions In summary, a simple strategy to prepare N, O, S and F Co-doped vesicular carbon with porous structures without the addition of hard templates or surfactant is first proposed, which has been successfully used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in Li-O2 batteries. The performances of the battery can be optimized by adjusting the F content in the porous carbon matrix. Further experiments combined with DFT simulation have revealed the action mechanism of C–F sites in both discharge and charge process. At discharge process, the introduced C–F sites can adsorb and promote the rapid and uniform formation of Li2O2, while during charge process, the existence of C–F bond is conducive to the rapid removal of Li+ and e− from Li2O2 and reduces the energy barrier for the interfacial charge transfer process of Li 2 O 2 - e - - Li + ↔ LiO 2 . This work paves the way of synthesis and application of heteroatomic doped carbon material for Li-O2 batteries and helps to understand the mechanism of nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2.

        "dc:description": "Li-O2 batteries provide an attractive and potential strategy for energy conversion and storage with high specific energy densities. However, large over-potential in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) caused by the decomposition obstacles of Li2O2 seriously impedes its electrochemical performances. Herein, a novel N, O, S and F co-doping vesicular carbon was prepared by self-template pyrolysis method and used in Li-O2 battery to tune the nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2. The introduction of F in the carbon matrix with suitable content can regulate the adsorption of intermediates, through which the morphology of Li2O2 can be controlled to film, favorable to its decomposition in charge process. The cathode based on the optimized F doped carbon vesicle exhibits improved electrochemical performances including a low over-potential, large capacity and a long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that F and C in C–F bond hasve a strong interaction to Li and O in Li2O2, respectively, which can enhance the transfer of electrons from Li2O2 to the carbon matrix to generate hole polaron and thus accelerate the delithiation and decomposition of Li2O2. This work provides a new sight into understanding the mechanism of nucleation and decomposition of Li2O2 for the development of high-performance Li-O2 batteries.",
