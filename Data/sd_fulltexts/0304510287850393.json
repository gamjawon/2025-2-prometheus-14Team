The ^O labeling experiments revealed that oxygen atoms involved in the oxygenated products 2 and 3 came from dioxygen and not from the oxyanions present in the heteropolyvanadates. Reaction of 6 with an excess of 1 under dinitrogen resulted in the formation of the blue complex [V(DBSQ)(DBcatH)2l2 (13), which was assumed to be the reaction intermediate complex in the catalysis on the basis of its reactivity and spectroscopic data. The reaction mechanism for the oxygenation of 1 catalyzed by heteropolyvanadates was discussed. Introduction Non-heme iron dioxygenases catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage of catechols [1]. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (1) with dioxygen has been investigated as a biomimetic reaction of the dioxygenase catalysis. Iron complexes such as [Fe(bpy)3]\"\"1\" (n = 2,3) [2] and [Fe(NTA)] (NTA = nitrilotriacetato) [3] or a ruthenium complex [RuCl2(PPh3)4] [4] are known to be efficient catalysts. Recently we have found [5] that vanadium(III or IV) complexes efficiently catalyzed the oxygenation of 1 just as non-heme iron dioxygenases. In this study we have examined the catalytic activity of vanadium(V) complexes such as [VO(DBcat**)2]~ and heteropolyvanadates for the oxygenation of 1, for the purpose of com- *Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed. ** Abbreviations used in this paper: DBcat, 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol dianion; DBcatH, 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol monoanion; DBSQ, 3,6-di-t-butylsemiquinone radical. 0304-6102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 58 parison with the previous results. In particular, we have been interested in oxygenation using heteropolyvanadates because these compounds have polynuclear structures with many oxyanions capable of oxidizing organic compounds. There are intriguing problems as to whether heteropoly- vanadates retain their original structures during the catalytic oxygenation cycle, and whether their oxyanions are incorporated into the reaction products. We have studied these problems by the spectroscopic and ^0 isotopic labeling experiments, and will discuss the reaction mechanism on the basis of the isolated complex which can be regarded as an intermediate of the reaction. Results and discussion Catalytic oxygenation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol 1 Catalytic activities of heteropolyvanadates and related complexes for the oxygenation of the catechol 1 were examined. The oxygenation was carried out in acetonitrile at room temperature under dioxygen (1 atm) for 24 h in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction gave two oxygenated products, 2,4-di-t-butylmuconic acid anhydride (2) and 4,6-di-t-butyl-2- pyrone (3) together with oxidized products 3,5-di-t-butyl-o-benzoquinone (4) and the quinone dimer, 3,4a,6,8-tetra-t-butyl-4a,10a-dihydrodibenzo- p-dioxin-l,2-dione (5) (and its isomer) as shown in eqn. 1. The results of these catalytic oxygenations are summarized in Table 1, where previous results of [V0(acac)2] -catalyzed oxygenation [5a] are included for compari- son. Activities and selectivities of three heteropolyvanadates lPVi4042]9\" (6) [6], [MnViaOag]7- (7) [7] and [NiVisOsg]7\" (8) [7] were similar to that of [V0(acac)2]. In the [V0(acac)2]-catalyzed oxygenation of 1, the dimer was also obtained when CH3CN was used as solvent (see footnote(e), Table 1). Table 1 indicates that heteroatoms such as P, Ni or Mn and the stoichiometry of the heteroatom to vanadium as 1:14 or 1:13 in complexes (6 - 8) do not affect their activities and selectivities in this catalysis. In contrast to vanadium complexes (6 - 8), heteropolymolybdic acid (9) and -tungstic acid (10) showed no activities. These facts suggest that polyatoms in heteropolyacids play an important role in this reaction rather than hetero- atoms, and that only vanadium is effective in contrast to molybdenum or tungsten. A similar trend was observed for the mononuclear complex. 59 TABLE 1 Oxidation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol 1 with dioxygen catalyzed by heteropolyvanadates and related compounds\" Catalyst Products (%)10 2345 (n-Bu^^stPVMf^zl-HaC^e)0-*1 34.3 11.4 18.6 6.6 (n-Bu4N)33Na37[MnVl3038] 24H20(7)d 34.1 19.9 18.8 9.1 (n-Bu4N)5Na2[NiVl3038] 16H20(8)d 35.6 12.3 15.1 10.6 H3[PMoi2C 4o]'30H20(9) 00 00 H3[PWi204o]'30H20(10) O O trace 0 Na[VO(DBcat)2](ll) 0 0 14.4 0 Na2[VO(OCH3)(DBcat)2] (12) 0 0 > 90 0 Mo02(acac)2 0 0 10.9 0 V0(acac)26 41 15 27 0 reaction conditions: I mM of 1 in CH3CN; the amounts of catalysts, 1:V, Mo or W = 100:1; room temperature; 1 atm of dioxygen.

Thus the latter formula was chosen. dThe contents of tetrabutylammonium cation were deduced from elemental analyses. \"Data from reference [5a] (solvent CHzClz) report that when CH3CN was used as solvent, the products 2, 3, 4 and 5 were obtained in 35.8, 20.2, 21.0 and 3.0% yields respectively. [Mo02(acac)2] [8] did not catalyze the oxygenation of 1, while [V0(acac)2] was efficient. Although the formal oxidation state of vanadium in NatV^DBcat);] (11) [9] or NaalV^OCHaXDBcat);] (12) [9] was the same as that of heteropolyvanadates, mononuclear vanadium(V) complexes (11, 12) were inactive for the reaction. On changing the amounts of catalyst 6 from 0.1 to 14% (per vanadium ion) based on 1, the yield and selectivities were almost invariant. Pyrocatechol or t-butylcatechol was also employed as a substrate instead of 1, but no oxygenated products were obtained. Spectroscopic studies on the catalytic system It is an interesting problem whether the structure of hetero- polyvanadates has been maintained during the catalytic cycle of the oxygenation of 1. In order to solve this problem, the catalytic system was studied spectroscopically. The compound 14-vanadophosphate 6 showed a characteristic band in the IR spectrum at 940 cm\"1 assignable to v(V=0), and was ESR silent because it contained vanadium(V) ions. A yellow-orange solution of the complex 6 in CH3CN was stable to air and showed no absorp- tion maxima in the range of 340 to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 1A. The solution smoothly changed to a blue color on addition of a 10-fold excess of the catechol 1 under dinitrogen. After standing at room temperature for 20 h, the solution exhibited a strong broad band in its electronic spectrum (Fig. 1B) at 646 nm (log e 3.97) which was analogous with, but not identical 60 Fig. 1. Visible absorption spectra of heteropolyvanadate 6 and reaction intermediates. 0.194 mM of 6 in CHsCN, (A) ( ); 10-fold excess of 1 + solution A under N2, (B) ( ); 02 + solution B, (C) (.......); 10-fold excess of 1+solution C under N2, (D) (- . -). to, that of semiquinone radical. An ESR sepectrum of the blue solution exhibited two peaks at g = 2.035 and g = 2.004 at 25 C which are charac- teristic of the semiquinone radical. Thus the blue color was probably cor- related to the semiquinone radical coordinated to vanadium. Introduction of dioxygen to the solution caused a shift of the absorption maximum from 646 nm to 620 nm (log e 3.69) (Fig. 1C) with a concomitant decrease in the intensity, and yielded the typical eight lines of vanadium(IV) ion in the ESR spectrum at 77 K. Vanadium(IV) ion must be formed by oxidation of low- valent vanadium species such as V(III) present in the blue solution with dioxygen. Dioxygen was removed from solution (C) and a 10-fold excess of 1 was. added under dinitrogen. The mixture, after keeping at room tem- perature for 24 h, exhibited spectrum (D) with a maximum at 630 nm (log 61 e 4.13) in Fig. 1. A similar spectrum was observed for the reaction mixture in the catalytic system which consumed half the theoretical amount of dioxygen. The ESR spectrum of the reaction mixture indicated the presence of the semiquinone radical but not the vanadium(IV) ion. A slight change in absorption spectra may be ascribed to the presence of quinone formed by dioxygen. Vanadium(IV) species would not be expected to be stable in the catalytic system because it was easily reduced by an excess of the catechol 1. Thus the results suggested that the catalysis was comprised of the redox reaction of vanadium ion together with oxygenation of semiquinone. After completion of the catalytic oxygenation of 1, the reaction mixture was evaporated and the organic compounds were removed by extraction with hexane. The IR spectrum of the residue showed a new band at 990 cm\"1, which was shifted to 960 cm\"1 on using ^0^ instead of \"O;, and the band at 940 cm\"1 observed for complex 6 disappeared. The band at 990 cm\"1 was very similar to that of v (V=0) of vanadium(IV)-oxo complexes such as [VO(salen)] or [V0(acac)2], implying that the structure of 14-vanadopho- sphate 6 was decomposed during the catalytic reaction. ^O isotopic labeling study Heteropolyvanadates contain many oxyanions which are potentially available for the oxygenation of 1. In the catalytic oxygenation cycle, heteropolyvanadates 6 turned out to be decomposed (vide supra). Whether oxyanions of 6 were incorporated into the oxygenated products 2 or 3 is an interesting issue. In order to solve the problem, ^0^ gas (99% purity) was employed for the catalytic oxygenation of 1 in the presence of 6 (1 mol% to 1). If the oxyanions were used in the catalytic oxygenation of 1, the maximum content of ^O included in the products should come to 42% (1 mol of the complex 6 contains 42 mol oxyanions in total). Mass spectrometry revealed that 2 contained exclusively one ^O atom and 3 contained one or two ^O atoms, as shown in equation 2. The compounds 4 and 5 contain no ^O atoms. These results indicate that oxyanions in 6 are not utilized in this catalysis. The oxyanions were probably converted to water when 14-vanadophosphate 6 was decomposed in the catalytic oxygenation of 1. Isolation and characterization of the reaction intermediate As mentioned above, the blue solution formed from heteropoly- vanadates 6 and the catechol 1 under dinitrogen was spectroscopically shown to contain the semiquinone radical and low-valent vanadium species. To characterize the blue species we isolated the complex, elucidated its structure and examined its reactivity. Addition of a four-fold excess of the catechol 1 to the solution of 6 in C^CN under dinitrogen resulted in a dark blue solution from which the blue complex (13) (m.p. 160 C dec) was obtained in a good yield after evaporation of the solvent and removal of an excess 1 by sublimation. As the catechol 1 enhanced the solubility of the complex and prevented further purification, a complete removal of 1 was 62 necessary. Its elemental analyses are in good agreement with the empirical formula C^Vi^O^V. Molecular weight (cryoscopic in CeHg) was 1500, proving that the blue complex was a dimer of the above formula (MW = 713.9). The IR spectrum showed a sharp v (OH) band at 3517 cm\"1 due to the catecholato monoanion, but no v (V=0) bands around 1000 cm\"1. A broad band due to coordinated water was not observed from 3000 to 3500 cm\"1. The ESR spectrum (Fig. 2A) showed two signals (^=2.037, 2.004) typical for an organic radical. Therefore the unpaired electron contained in the blue complex 13 is localized on the organic ligands, and not on the vanadium nucleus. The signal at g = 2.004 showed hyperfine structures (Aav = 2.1 G) (Fig. 2B) resulting from coupling with the vanadium nucleus, which was the same as that of [V(DBSQ)3] [10]. On addition ofdioxygen, an isotropic eight-line ESR spectrum at g = 1.988 with hyperfine coupling (A = 92.9 G) due to \"V (I = 7/2) was observed, together with the residual semiquinone radical peak (Fig. 2C) indicating the formation of vanadium(IV) species from the initial low-valent ion, possibly vanadium(III), by oxidation. The vanadium(IV) species was fairly stable at ambient tem- perature in the absence of an excess of 1, while ESR signals of vanadium(IV) species in the catalytic oxygenation of 1 were observed only at 77 K, as described above. On the basis of the characterizations for the blue inter- mediate complex 13, we tentatively propose its molecular structure as [V(DBSQ)(DBcatH)2L, which is illustrated in Fig. 3. 63 3000 3200 3400 3600 HIGauss) Fig. 2.

The proposed structure of the blue complex ^3. 64 The semiquinone radical DBSQ is assumed to coordinate to two vanadium(III) as a bridging ligand, just as in [VO(DBSQ)(DBcat)]2 [10]. The electronic absorption spectrum of complex 13 in the mixture of CHzC^- CHaCN (1:10) showed an absorption maximum at 666 nm (log e 4.09) with a small peak at 385 nm, which was very similar to Fig. IB. Addition of dioxygen or an excess of 1 resulted in a spectral change similar to that of mixture of heteropolyvanadates 6 and the catechol 1, as previously des- cribed. In order to confirm whether the complex 13 is the actual reaction intermediate complex in the catalysis, its reactivity toward dioxygen and catalytic activity for the oxygenation of 1 were examined. Reaction of the blue complex 13 with dioxygen in CH^Cl; gave 2, 3, 4 and 5 in 1.26, 0.56, 2.58 and 0.11 mol (based on 1 mol of the complex) respectively (eqn. 3).

The activity and selectivity of the complex 13 for the 0, U 36.3 3^ 16.8 4 20.8 (4) (%) oxygenation of I were essentially the same with heteropolyvanadates 6. These results demonstrated that the blue complex 13 was one of the reaction intermediates in the oxygenation of 1 catalyzed by the heteropolyvanadates 6. The solubility of the complex 13 in acetonitrile was low. An excess of catechol probably prevented the dimerization of the monomeric blue complex during the catalytic cycle. From this study we conclude that (1) heteropolyvanadates are efficient catalysts in the oxygenation of 1, (2) the complexes are decomposed during catalysis by the catechol 1 to give the monomer or dimer of vanadium(III) complex as an active catalyst, (3) the semiquinone radical seems to be the key compound in the oxygenation of 1. A plausible reaction scheme for the catalytic oxygenation of 1 by heteropolyvanadates is shown in Scheme 1. ^U^19' ^^-OH [MV^O^- (M = Ni,Mn) Scheme 1. \"Vanadium Complex\" + Products(2,3,4,5) 65 Experimental section Materials Sodium salts of l:14-vanadophosphate, l:13-vanadomanganate, 1:13- vanadonickelate, [VC^DBca^]\", [VO(OCH3)(DBcat)2]2- and [MoO;- (acac)2J were prepared by the literature methods. Sodium heteropoly- vanadates were converted to n-butylammonium salts by addition of an excess of n-Bu4NBr. l:14-Molybdophosphate, l:14-tungstophosphate and [V0(acac)2] were commercially available as reagent grade materials (Nakarai Chem. Ind. Co.). 3,5-Di-t-butylcatechol was recrystallized from hexane. ^O^ gas (99% purity) was obtained from BOC Limited Prochem. Acetonitrile and dichloromethane were dried over calcium hydride and distilled under dinitrogen atmosphere. Procedure Catalytic oxygenation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol 1 To a solution of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (222.3 mg, 1 mmol) in CHaCN (10 ml) was added a solution of heteropolyvanadates (20 mM, 0.5 ml) under dinitrogen atmosphere. Dioxygen was introduced to the reaction mixture with stirring and the amount of dioxygen consumed was measured by a gas burette. After stirring for 24 h under dioxygen, the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in CHCIa for purification through column chromatography on silica gel (eluant, CHC^). From the first fraction the quinone dimer 5 was obtained as white powder, which was recrystallized from hexane, m.p. 144 C. Anal. calcd for Czs^W^: C, 76.32%, H, 9.15%. Found: C, 76.27%; H, 9.29%. Mass spectra; m/e 440. ^ NMR of the dimer showed eight singlets around 1 ppm due to t-butyl groups, indicating that the quinone dimer contains at least two dimers. 2,4-Di-t-butylmuconic acid anhydride 2, 3,5-di-t-butyl-o-benzoquinone 4 and 4,6-di-t-butyl-2-pyrone 3 were eluted on chromatography in that order and were identified as previously reported. Oxygenation of 1 catalyzed by heteropolymolybdates, heteropolytungstates and other complexes were similarly carried out. Isolation of the blue intermediate complex To an orange-yellow solution of 1:14 vanadophosphate 6 (344.2 mg, 2 mmol based on vanadium) in C^CN (25 ml) was added a solution of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (1.823 g, 8.2 mmol) in CHsCN (25 ml) and addi- tional solvent (25 ml) under dinitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The initial orange-yellow color turned to green and then deep blue. After stirring for 20 h, the dark blue solution was concentrated to dryness, giving a dark blue tarry material. The residue was dissolved in 100 ml of hexane and filtered. Dark blue solids were obtained from the hexane solution after evaporation of the solvents and subsequent removal of the unreacted 1 by sublimation (60-70 C/10~3 mmHg). The blue solids were extracted with a 66 large amount of hot hexane to afford the analytically pure blue solids, 13 (1.208 g, 1.69 mmol, 84.6%) mp 160 C (dec). Reaction of the blue complex 13 with dioxygen Dioxygen was introduced to a solution of the blue complex 13 (376.9 mg, 0.528 mmol) in Cfl^Cl^ (40 ml) with stirring. The blue color gradually turned to moss green and finally to dark red. After stirring for 20 h, the reaction mixture was evaporated and the residue was purified by column chromatography. Catalytic oxygenation of 1 in the presence of the blue complex 13 Reaction conditions and procedures were the same as described above for the catalytic oxygenation of 1, except CHzCl; was used as solvent instead of CHaCN. Instruments Infrared spectra were obtained in Nujol mulls with a Hitachi IR spectro- meter 295, and ESR spectra were measured on a Jeol JES-ME. 'H NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol FX-100 at 100 MHz. Electronic absorption spectra were taken using a Hitachi recording spectrometer EPS-3T and a Schimazu UV-VIS recording spectrometer UV-260.

Three heteropolyvanadates, [PV14O42]9− (6), [MnV13O38]7− (7) and [NiV13O38]7− (8) efficiently catalyzed the oxygenation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (1) with dioxygen to give 2,4-di-t-butylmuconic acid anhydride (2), 4,6-di-t-butyl-2-pyrone (3), 3,5-di-t-butyl-o-benzoquinone (4) and the quinone dimer 3,4a,6,8-tetra-t-butyl-4a,10a-dihydrodibenzo-p-dioxin-1,2-dione (5).The 18O labeling experiments revealed that oxygen atoms involved in the oxygenated products 2 and 3 came from dioxygen and not from the oxyanions present in the heteropolyvanadates. Reaction of 6 with an excess of 1 under dinitrogen resulted in the formation of the blue complex [V(DBSQ)(DBcatH)2]2 (13), which was assumed to be the reaction intermediate complex in the catalysis on the basis of its reactivity and spectroscopic data. The reaction mechanism for the oxygenation of 1 catalyzed by heteropolyvanadates was discussed. References 1 (a) M. Nozaki Top. Curr. Chem. 78 1979 145 (b) L. Que Jr. Struct.
