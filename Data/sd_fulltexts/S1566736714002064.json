Highly dispersed cerium oxide subnano-particles containing coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Ce in a lower oxidation state (3+) were deposited onto γ-Al2O3 using a pulsed arc-plasma process. The as-prepared and thermally aged Ce/Al2O3 catalysts were found to exhibit much higher activities for CO oxidation than those prepared using a conventional wet impregnation process. Characterization by HAADF-STEM, XAFS, XPS and FT-IR and kinetic analysis suggested that the surface abundance of cus Ce plays a key role in the unusual catalytic activity and deviation from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. Graphical abstract Keywords Arc-plasma process Ce Al2O3 CO oxidation 1 Introduction The use of cerium oxides in catalysis has attracted considerable attention. In addition to their use as oxygen storage components and support materials capable of anchoring platinum group metal particles in automotive catalysts, there are several emerging applications, including soot combustion, water gas shift reaction, CO oxidation, catalytic wet oxidation and electrochemical reactions [1–8]. In most cases, cerium oxides in the form of nanometric particles with high specific surface areas are required for these applications. Although a wide variety of synthetic techniques have been developed to prepare cerium oxide nanoparticles [9], one-step depositions from the bulk Ce metal onto support powders are rarely reported in the literature. We recently reported a novel method for the preparation of supported precious metal catalysts using pulsed arc-plasma [10–14], which enables one-step deposition of highly dispersed precious metal nanoparticles from bulk metals, in contrast to conventional multi-step wet impregnation processes. In the present study, we have applied this technique for the first time to non-precious metal Ce catalysts supported on oxide powders to study structural differences from those prepared by conventional wet impregnation. The effects of the local structure on catalytic performance were investigated using CO oxidation as a model reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalyst powders (0.7wt%) were prepared using a pulsed cathodic arc-plasma apparatus (Fig. S1 in Supplementary data) [10–14], which consisted of a vacuum chamber with a turbo-molecular pumping system, an arc-plasma gun (Ulvac Inc., ARL-300) with a Ce metal cathode (ϕ10 mm, Furuya Metals, Co. Ltd.), and a powder container with a rotating stirring mechanism. γ-Al2O3 powders (JRC-ALO8, supplied by Catalysis Society of Japan, BET surface area: 160m2 ·g−1) were placed in the container. The vacuum chamber was then filled with N2 and evacuated below 1×10−3 Pa overnight in order to remove any adsorbed gases from Al2O3. A pulsed arc-plasma with a period of 0.2ms and current amplitude of 2 kA was generated with a frequency of 2Hz. The plasma thus generated from the Ce cathode entered into the container filled with Al2O3 powders with stirring at a rotation rate at 60rpm. The pressure was maintained at less than 1×10−3 Pa during the deposition. The amount of Ce loading after 40,000 pulses was approximately 0.7wt%. The catalyst with the same composition was also prepared by a conventional wet impregnation process, using an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)3 (Wako Chemicals) and subsequent heating at 600°C for 3h in air. The catalysts prepared by pulsed arc-plasma and wet impregnation process are denoted as ‘AP’ and ‘imp’, respectively. The as-prepared catalysts were thermally aged at 900°C for 25h in air. 2.2 Characterization and catalytic test The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by HAADF-STEM, XAFS, XPS, XRD, XRF, FT-IR and gas adsorption. The details of characterization are shown in the supplementary data. The catalytic tests for CO oxidation were performed in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (10–20mesh, 50mg) was fixed in a quartz tube (ϕ4 mm inner diameter) with quartz wool at both ends of the catalyst bed. The temperature dependence of the catalytic activity was evaluated in a light-off mode by heating the catalyst bed from room temperature to 600°C at a constant rate of 10°C·min−1, while supplying a gas mixture containing CO (0.1%), O2 (1.25%) and He (balance) at 100cm3·min−1 (W/F=5.0×10−4 g·min·cm−3). The concentration of CO and CO2 in the effluent gas was analyzed using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas analyser (Horiba VA3000). Kinetic analysis of CO oxidation was carried out using thermally aged catalysts in an isothermal steady-state mode. Attainment of steady state was confirmed by constant conversions versus time-on-stream, which were always kept below 20% capable of a rough approximation for a differential reactor. To determine the apparent activation energy, CO oxidation over Ce/Al2O3(AP) and Ce/Al2O3(imp) was carried out using the same gas feed at 500–570K and 570–680K, respectively. The effects of CO/O2 partial pressures on CO oxidation over Ce/Al2O3(AP) and Ce/Al2O3(imp) were measured at 310°C and 600°C, respectively. The CO partial pressure in the gas feed was varied from 0.025 to 0.2 kPa with keeping the O2 partial pressure at 1.25 kPa. The O2 partial pressure was then varied from 0.25 to 1.25 kPa with keeping the CO partial pressure at 0.1 kPa. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Structure of catalyst The as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP) powders were greyish rather than white, implying the presence of Ce in a lower oxidation state (3+). The color was stable in ambient air, but changed to white after thermal ageing at 900°C in air (Fig. S2 in Supplementary data). This was not the case for Ce/Al2O3(imp), which was white before and after thermal ageing. Fig. 1a shows the Cs-corrected HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP). A simple comparison with the image of bare γ-Al2O3 grains (Fig. 1b) suggests that a number of bright dots observed on the surface of Al2O3 are subnano-particles of Ce. They should be in a form of oxides because all the Ce particles deposited by the pulsed arc-plasma process under vacuum are oxidized when exposed to ambient air. Considering their size (<1nm), these subnano-particles are atomic clusters closely equivalent to the unit cell parameter of CeO2 (a =0.54nm). After thermal ageing at 900°C in air, most of these subnano-particles had grown up to ~2nm in size, but they were still highly dispersed on Al2O3 (Fig. S3 in Supplementary data). It should be noted that such a small amount (0.7wt%) of dispersed Ce oxide nano/subnano-particles could be detected only by HAADF-STEM, which is a powerful technique suited for Z-contrast (Z: the atomic number). By contrast, they could not be identified by bright-field TEM and powder XRD experiments (Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary data). The structure of Ce/Al2O3(imp) was also characterized in a similar way, but no evidence of Ce oxide nano/subnano-particles could be obtained. As was pointed out by previous reports [15], Ce species in Ce/Al2O3(imp) are difficult to detect when they form a CeAlO3-like surface layer as well as its amorphous precursor phase. The possibility of CeAlO3 formation in Ce/Al2O3(AP) is discussed later. Fig. 2 shows the normalized Ce LIII-edge XANES spectra for Ce/Al2O3(AP) and Ce/Al2O3(imp) together with CeO2 and CePO4 as standards for Ce4+ and Ce3+, respectively. The presence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in Ce/Al2O3 can be distinguished by the different positions of white lines corresponding to transitions from 2p3/2 to the unoccupied mixed 4f5d states [16]. The relative quantities of each oxidation state were calculated using a linear combination of fitting parameters (Table S1 in the Supplementary data). The as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP) exhibited an intense white line at 5723eV (Fig. 2a), suggesting the considerable presence of Ce3+ (44%). The peak became less intense after thermal ageing, giving rise to two distinct peaks at ~5729 and ~5737eV indicative of the presence of Ce4+. The fraction of Ce3+ thus decreased to 13% after ageing at 900°C. This means the progress of oxidation from Ce3+ to Ce4+ by thermal ageing. The overall oxidation state of Ce in Ce/Al2O3(imp) exhibited different behavior (Fig. 2b). As-prepared Ce/Al2O3(imp) after calcination at 600°C contained only 12% Ce3+, but it increased to 38% after thermal ageing at 900°C, probably because of the formation of CeAlO3 as discussed later. Fig. 3 shows Ce K-edge EXAFS of Ce/Al2O3(AP) and Ce/Al2O3(imp) without corrections for phase shifts. The as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP) exhibited very weak peaks assignable to Ce–O and Ce–Ce shells in accordance with the Ce subnano-particles consisting of coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Ce species. By contrast, the thermally aged Ce/Al2O3(AP) exhibited two intense peaks attributed to Ce–O and Ce–Ce shells of CeO2, suggesting that the atomic scale Ce clusters were aggregated and crystallized as CeO2 with a fluorite-type structure, as observed by HAADF-STEM (Fig. S3 in Supplementary data). This is not the case for Ce/Al2O3(imp), which showed no reliable peaks before and after thermal ageing, implying a random Ce–O bond length as a result of interactions with Al2O3. Although we do not have direct evidence for such interactions, the formation of CeAlO3 as well as its amorphous precursor phase in the impregnated Ce/Al2O3 has been reported by many researchers [17–22]. It is reported that similar EXAFS can be observed when a small amount of Ce is impregnated onto γ-Al2O3 [19,21]. The very small peak intensities comparable to background fluctuation can be kept unchanged unless CeAlO3 crystallizes as a perovskite phase by heating at 900–1000°C in H2. The resulting CeAlO3 gives XANES quite similar to that of CePO4 [23], which is consistent with the present results (Fig. 2). All these characterization results indicate that Ce/Al2O3(AP) can be characterized by nano/subnano-particle Ce oxide as well as an abundance of cus Ce species in a lower oxidation state (3+). Although the overall oxidation number of Ce was increased by thermal ageing (Fig. 2a), the relative surface abundance of Ce3+ determined by XPS was kept unchanged (Fig. S6). Here, it should be noted that two different forms of Ce3+ may be possible in the present system, i.e., one is Ce3+ in Ce oxide nano/subnano-particles and the other is an amorphous precursor phase of CeAlO3. The presence of the former Ce3+ in as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP) is obvious from HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1) and XANES (Fig. 2a) while the contribution of the latter Ce3+ seems to be unclear. However, judging from EXAFS of thermally aged Ce/Al2O3(AP), which clearly suggests the presence of CeO2 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 in Supplementary data), the formation of an amorphous CeAlO3 precursor seems to be significantly suppressed compared to that in Ce/Al2O3(imp). 3.2 CO oxidation activity Fig. 4 compares the light-off curves of the CO–O2 reaction over Ce/Al2O3 during the temperature ramp at 10°C·min−1. The light-off of a stream of 0.1% CO, 1.25% O2 and He balance was observed at 250°C for the as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP), compared to higher than 600°C for the Ce/Al2O3(imp). The thermal ageing at 900°C caused the deactivation of Ce/Al2O3(imp) but enhanced the activity of Ce/Al2O3(AP). Because the BET surface area (S BET) of both catalysts decreased in a similar manner, sintering is not the reason for the observed difference in thermal behavior (Table 1 ). Both catalysts exhibited no hysteresis in CO conversion when the reaction temperature was linearly increased and subsequently decreased at the same rate. According to in situ FT-IR measurement (Fig. S7 in Supplementary data), CO was weakly adsorbed on cus Ce sites to yield a band at ~2175cm−1 as was reported by several researchers [7,24,25]. Ce/Al2O3(AP) before and after thermal ageing exhibited a higher relative intensity of the band than Ce/Al2O3(imp) because of the more abundant cus Ce sites. Most of the adsorbed CO interacts strongly with the surface oxygen followed by spillover onto Al2O3 surface to form carbonate species in the range of 1700–1200cm−1. However, the carbonate bands were less intense for as-prepared Ce/Al2O3(AP) than Ce/Al2O3(imp) because of the lower oxidation state of Ce. According to Breysse et al. [26], the oxidation of CO over CeO2 consists of the following Mars–van Krevelen mechanism: (1) CO gas ⇄ CO ads (2) CO ads + O O ⇄ CO 2 ads + V O (3) CO 2 ads ⇄ CO 2 gas (4) O 2 gas + 2 V O ⇄ 2 O O In these reaction steps, the adsorption of gaseous O2 (O2 gas) onto a vacancy in the anionic lattice of CeO2 (VO) is rapid (4), whereas the reaction of adsorbed CO (COads) and lattice oxygen (OO) is slow (2). Therefore, the CO oxidation rate is considered to be independent of the partial pressure of O2. To verify this hypothesis, the dependence of CO oxidation rate on the partial pressures of CO and O2 was measured (Table 1 and Fig. S8 in Supplementary data). As expected, Ce/Al2O3(imp) exhibited partial orders with respect to CO and O2 of ~1.0 and ~0.0, respectively. This is in complete contrast to Ce/Al2O3(AP), which exhibited partial orders with respect to CO and O2 of ~0.5 and ~0.2, respectively. The positive orders with respect to CO and O2 implies deviation from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The result may suggest that Ce/Al2O3(AP) exhibits different CO oxidation behavior because the highly dispersed cus Ce sites affect the CO and O2 adsorption steps on the surface, although details of the reaction mechanism remain unclear. From the temperature dependence of the CO oxidation rates (p CO =0.01 kPa, p O2 =0.125 kPa), which yield linear relationships between the logarithmic oxidation rates and 1/T, the apparent activation energy (E a) was calculated (Table 1 and Fig. S9 in Supplementary data). Ce/Al2O3(AP) exhibited approximately a two-fold higher E a than that of Ce/Al2O3(imp), suggesting that a larger number of cus Ce sites on Ce/Al2O3(AP) play the role of active site. 4 Conclusions Subnano-particles of Ce oxide highly dispersed on γ-Al2O3 were successfully prepared by the pulsed arc-plasma process for the first time. As-prepared and thermally aged Ce/Al2O3 could be characterized by more abundant cus Ce species in the low oxidation state (+3) and the higher CO oxidation activity than the catalysts prepared by the conventional wet impregnation process. Kinetic analysis suggests that deviation from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism and the higher apparent activation energy are associated with the highly dispersed cus Ce sites.
