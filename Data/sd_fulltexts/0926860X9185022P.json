However, heterogeneous catalysis involves the surface interface and the layer adsorbed upon the surface. As the first to conduct experiments upon the spreading of films on the surface, Franlin should be recognized by us as a contributor to the beginnings of catalysis science. Franklin's numerous accomplishments have tended to push his scientific endeavours into the background. Indeed, Franklin himself frequently chose other matters over that of science. Franklin was a knowledgeable scientist who was qualified to correspond among that group of mostly amateur scientists who laboured only for the love of science and the thrill of attempting to understand nature. As a youth, Franklin read Pliny's \"Natural History\", the great encyclopedia of fact and fiction published in the first century A.D. Franklin was a self-taught scientist and inventor, as well as writer, publisher, philosopher, statesman and negotiator. As a publisher and businessman, he became independently wealthy, and at a reasonably young age so that he could entrust business to others and devote himself to his multitude of interests that were to him more enjoyable. Franklin lived in a simple time: no electricity, no telegraph or telephone, no steamship, no radio or television. The Franklin of a recent biographer, Professor Charles Tanford, stands out as one of the great men of all time in the English-speaking world, rarely matched in intellectual power and clarity of expression. Tanford is persuasive both in his reasoning and in his presentation of facts to support his observations, and one is inclined to accept his view after reading his book. One should keep in mind that Stanford, given the opportunity of a time-machine, would return to the time of Franklin rather than venture 200 years into the future. Ben Franklin, as I met him in elementary school, was not an impressive individual. First, he was presented as a young lad arriving in Philadelphia from Boston, walking the streets with a loaf of bread under his arm and eating as he went. The other image was that of a more mature person flying a kite with a key attached to the string in a thunder storm; having already learned first-hand what a bolt of lightning could do to a tree or to an unfortunate neighbour standing in a doorway viewing the storm, the reviewer was not impressed by Franklin's experiment. My introduction to Franklin did not do him justice. Franklin kept abreast of developments in the European scientific community through frequent letters from Peter Collinson in London. The letters were sent to the Library Company, an outgrowth of the first library that was established in the colonies by Franklin. Franklin, starting in March 1747, wrote a number of letters to Collinson. Some of these letters were read to the Royal Society and Collinson eventually arranged for the publication of many of these letters in a book \"Experiments and Observations on Electricity\". This book went through several editions and was translated into French, German and Italian. It brought Franklin fame and in 1754 he was awarded the prestigious Copley Medal of the Royal Society for his work on electricity. Shortly thereafter, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. During that century there was a heated debate about the nature of electricity: one group held to a two-fluid theory of electricity while others, including Franklin, held to a one-fluid theory. applied catalysis - Volume 79 No. 1 -26 November 1991 N13 Primarily, because of Collinson's interest in discriminating the result of Franklin's research, Ben Franklin became widely respected as an effective proponent of the one-fluid theory. Franklin was a tough task-master on himself. In 1749 he wrote Collinson that he was \"chagrin'd a little that we have been hitherto able to discover nothing in this way of use to mankind\". He planned to put an end to his experiments for the summer season with a party on the banks of the Schuylkil River in Philadelphia: \"Spirits, O the same time, are to be fired by a spark sent from side to side through the river without any other conductor than the water; ... a turkey is to be killed for our dinner by the electrical shock, and roasted by the electrical jack. Before a fire kindled by the electrified bottle: when the hearths of all the famous electricians in England, Holland, France, and Germany are to be drunk in electrified bumpers [an electrified glass of wine, which gives a shock when brought to the lips \"if the party be close shaved, and does not breath on the liquor\"], under the discharge of guns from the electrical battery [1].\" Franklin did not appear to realize that he was making a solid lasting contribution to the foundations of science. However, within a year of the above letter, Franklin invented the lightning rod and should have then recognized that his work had benefitted mankind. In the 1750s, Franklin began a period of public service and serious diplomacy at the national and international level, and his scientific endeavours declined. Franklin's ties to catalysis are contained in a paper entitled \"Of the Stilling of Waves by means of Oil. Extracted from sundry letters between Benjamin Franklin, LLD., F.R.S., William Brownrigg, M.D., F.R.S. and the Reverend Mr Farish\" which was published in the Philosophical Transactions (Volume 64 (1774)). This paper describes Franklin's observations from his experiments with the stilling of waves by the spreading of oil upon the water and his interpretations of the cause of this. h remained more than 100 years before Lord Rayleigh repeated Franklin's experiment in the laboratory and calculated the thickness of the film. Ms. Agnes Pockels, a German making scientific observations while working in her kitchen, developed an ingenious instrument for making accurate measurements of the spreading of oil on water. It remained for Irving Langmuir to bring Franklin's observation THICKNESS OF SPREAD OLIVE OIL FILM ON WATER Amount of Area at Oil Added Full Expansion Film Thickness Franklin (1774) 1 teaspoon 1/2 acre 10 x10'$ cm (2 cm) Rayleigh (1890) 0.8 mg 5500 cm2 16 x10 cm (0.0009 cm?)

Tanford presents in his biography (1 ] a wide ranging overview of Franklin and his oil film experiment. Tanford has written an outstanding book that is a joy to read. It 1s recommended without reservations. To those who yearn for yesterday, every page will elicit a sight of \"How true, how true.\" To those who only look forward, Tanford's work will cause them to pause to gaze in wonderment at the accomplishments of the amateur intellectual giants of this period. Above all, Tanford makes an exceptionally strong case that the greatest experimental instrument is the human mind. REFERENCE 1 C.
