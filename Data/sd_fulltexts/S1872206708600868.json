The PILCs were obtained using bentonite clay from Bogovina, Serbia. The change in chemical and phase composition and textural properties of the starting clay and synthesized catalysts was monitored using X-ray diffraction, inductively cou- pled plasma optical emission spectrometry, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry, and physisorption of nitrogen. The catalytic per- formance was examined using gas chromatography. The Na-exchange process lowered the (001) smectite basal plane spacing, but the clay retained its swelling properties, while the pillaring process increased it. The surface areas of both synthesized pillared clays increased to similar values although their Fe content was different. At 37 qC, both catalysts show significant toluene degradation, with the one richer in Fe having higher efficiency. The leaching of the active cations during reaction was negligible, and the catalysts were stable. AlFe-pillared clay catalysts can be used in CWPO for the elimination of BTEX compounds from plant effluent streams. Key words: catalytic wet peroxide oxidation; hydrogen peroxide; pillared interlayered clay; toluene; water treatment Aromatic compounds known under the abbreviation BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-, m-, and p-xylene) often are major environmental contaminants, especially in areas contaminated by refined petroleum products [1,2]. BTEX have been classified into the group of compounds most dangerous to the environment due to their fast migration, both in aquatic and land environments, and their acute and chronic toxicities [3]. These aromatic hydrocarbons are used in large quantities as components of automobile fuels and raw materials in various industries as chemical intermediates and solvents for plastic, medicinal, botanicals, gaskets, sealing devices, wood furniture, paints and allied products, miscellaneous industrial chemicals, etc. [4–6]. Toluene itself is a widely used reagent for the preparation of many compounds, such as benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, and chloro derivatives [7]. These appli- cations cause water pollution and endanger human health. In most countries, obligatory standards are set for these hydro- carbons. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for instance, requires that the amount of a contaminant in drinking water should not exceed the established Maximum Contami- nant Level, which for toluene is 1 mg/kg [8]. Processing plant effluent streams that contain BTEX com- pounds, which are not readily degradable, requires effective treatment [9]. The techniques usually adopted for water puri- fication from BTEX are based on phase separation methods, adsorption on active suspended materials and biodegradation [10,11]. There are several drawbacks to each of these methods, including being unable to remove large quantities of pollutants, time consuming, and effective only at low concentration levels. Catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) is a promising method for the removal of BTEX from water at mild tem- perature and pressure because hydrogen peroxide can produce highly reactive HO x radicals on the transition metal cation sites on the catalysts [3,9]. The possible leaching of the active metal Predrag BANKOVI � et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 14–18 cations can be overcome if a pillared interlayered clay (PILC) is used as the catalyst. Metal oxide PILCs represent a new class of materials that have found a wide range of potential applica- tions in catalytic, adsorption, and separation processes [12]. The CWPO of phenol using AlFe-PILCs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been shown to be successful [13–15]. However, these have not been tested thoroughly for the degradation of less water soluble BTEX compounds al- though the CWPO of Cu-doped alumina-pillared montmoril- lonite has been studied for toluene [16]. This work studied the removal of toluene from water using AlFe-PILC as the catalyst. The goals were to synthesize the catalysts from smectite clays from domestic (Serbian) sources by pillaring with Al 3+ together with Fe 3+ as catalytically active components, use the catalysts obtained in the above mentioned reaction, and test the catalytic activity of AlFe-PILC using different Fe 3+ /Al 3+ ratios. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The starting material was a domestic clay from Bogovina [17,18]. The � 2 μm fraction of this clay with cation exchange capacity (estimated by the ammonium acetate method) of 765 mmol/kg was used and denoted raw clay. The raw clay was submitted to a Na-exchange procedure by repeated stirring with 1 mol/L NaCl followed by filtration. The obtained filtra- tion cake was rinsed with distilled water to remove NaCl and other excess exchangeable cations from the sample. The rins- ing was repeated until the filtrate was Cl � free (confirmed by the AgNO 3 precipitation test). The Na-exchanged clay was dried at 110 °C. The process of pillaring was carried out according to a common procedure [19]. Pillaring solutions were adjusted to have the Fe 3+ /(Al 3+ +Fe 3+ ) atomic ratio of either 10% or 15% and OH � /(Al 3+ +Fe 3+ ) ratio of 2.0. The procedure included continuous stirring at 60 qC for 3 h and at room temperature overnight. In the next step the appropriate amount of the pil- laring solutions to give a (Al 3+ +Fe 3+ )/clay ratio of 20 mmol/g was slowly added into the Na-exchanged bentonite dispersion in distilled water. After being rigorously stirred at 80 qC for 3 h, the final suspension was stirred at room temperature overnight, alternately centrifuged (5000 r/min) and washed with water, and finally air-dried overnight at 110 °C. It was then calcined at 300 qC for 2 h. These are referred to as AlFe10-PILC and AlFe15-PILC, respectively, for the materials made from solu- tions having Fe 3+ /(Al 3+ +Fe 3+ ) ratios of 10% and 15%. The chemicals used for the Na exchange and pillaring were NaCl from Moss Belgrade, Al(NO 3 ) 3 from Kemika Zagreb, Fe(NO 3 ) 3 from Centrohem Belgrade, and NaOH from Moss Belgrade. 1.2 Toluene oxidation The reaction of toluene oxidation was carried out using the procedure previously reported for phenol degradation [14] and described below. A 500 ml thermostated Pyrex reactor equipped with a stirrer was used. The reaction temperature was regulated by the circulation of a thermal fluid at 37 qC using a Julabo MC 4 heating circulator. The reactor contained 150 ml aqueous toluene solution (2 mmol/L), and hydrogen peroxide that corresponded to 20 mol of H 2 O 2 per mole of toluene was introduced. The stoichiometric quantity needed to totally transform toluene into CO 2 (i.e., 18 mol H 2 O 2 per mole of toluene) was slightly exceeded. The obtained solution was analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-9A gas chromatograph equipped with a Supelco SPB-1, 30 m u 0.25 mm capillary column. The surface area of the eluted toluene peak was adopted as the measure of the initial toluene concentration and taken as 100% in the monitoring of toluene degradation. The solid catalyst (0.75 g) was then introduced into the vessel, and this was taken as zero time of the reaction. The obtained sus- pension was held under continuous stirring at atmospheric pressure. Aliquots of 3 ml were taken at set periods of time (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h) and, after filtration (Cole-Palmer nylon syringe filters with PP housing; pore size = 0.20 μm), were analyzed by gas chromatography. 1.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for powders of raw and pillared clays were obtained using a Philips PW 1710 X-ray powder diffractometer with a Cu anode ( O = 0.154178 nm). UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis-DR) spectra were re- corded using a Thermo Electron Nicolet Evolution 500 UV-VIS spectrophotometer equipped with an RSA-UC-40 diffuse reflectance accessory in the wavelength range of 250–850 nm. A Spectro Spectroflame M inductively coupled plasma op- tical emission spectrometer with atomic absorption spec- trometer was used for the chemical analysis of the raw and pillared clays and to determine potential leaching of pillaring cations from the catalysts. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were determined on a Sorptomatic 1990 Thermo Finningen at –196 qC. Samples were outgassed at 160 qC for 20 h. Various models in the software WinADP were used to analyze the isotherms. The specific surface area, A BET , was calculated according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method [20,21]. Total pore volume was calculated according to the Gurvitch method for p/p 0 = 0.98 [20,21]. Pore size distribution for mesopores was calcu- lated according to the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method from the Predrag BANKOVI � et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 14–18 desorption branch of the isotherms [22]. Micropores were analyzed using the Dubinin-Radushkevich method [17,23]. 2 Results and discussion According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 1), the following phases were present in the samples: smectite, quartz, feldspar, and a small amount of an amorphous phase [24]. A small hump between 2 = 19° and 30° attributed to X-ray amorphous matter was also observed. The (001) smectite peak around 2 = 6° shifted during different stages of the pillaring process. The Na-exchange process lowered d 001 from 1.53 nm (2 = 5.78°) for the starting clay to 1.28 nm (2 = 6.92°), but the clay retained its swelling properties. The pillaring process increased and fixed the basal spacing of the clay. This resulted in the shift of the (001) smectite peak to 2 = 5.40° (d 001 = 1.64 nm) for AlFe10-PILC and 2 = 5.66° (d 001 = 1.56 nm) for AlFe15-PILC. The obtained results are in accordance with previously published data [15,25–29]. The chemical compositions of raw, Na-exchanged, and pil- lared clays are presented in Table 1. The observed decrease of the CaO content was caused by the Na-exchange process, the preceding step to the synthesis of PILCs. In further pillaring steps, Na + undergoes cation exchange by polioxocationic pillar precursors. The remaining sodium in the pillared samples can be ascribed to species such as feldspar. A significant increase of the Fe 2 O 3 content was observed in both pillared samples. It was higher in AlFe15-PILC than in AlFe10-PILC. The change in Al 2 O 3 content after pillaring followed the same pattern (the more Al 3+ introduced into the pillaring solution, the higher the Al 2 O 3 content in the corresponding pillared clay sample). UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Na-exchanged and both AlFe-pillared clays are presented in Fig. 2. In both AlFe-PILCs, new absorption bands, with respect to Na-exchanged clay, appeared around 280, 365, and 500 nm. These are related to isolated Fe 3+ cations, small oligonuclear (FeO) n species, and intervalence Fe–O–Fe charge transfer in the chain-type iron-alumina pillars of the clay [30–32]. AlFe15-PILC showed more intense absorption compared with AlFe10-PILC. This is a consequence of the higher iron content in AlFe15-PILC. Fig. 3 shows nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for Na-exchanged clay and AlFe15-PILC. The adsorption-de- sorption isotherm for AlFe10-PILC has been omitted from Fig. 3 because the hysteresis curves of the two pillared clays over- lapped due to their similar shape and position. The relevant data for all three samples obtained using the WinADP software are presented in Table 2. The curves presented in Fig. 3 are Type II isotherms ac- cording to the IUPAC classification [21,33]. A sharp decline in the region of low relative pressure suggests the presence of micropores. All the isotherms have a reversible part at low relative pressures and hysteresis loops at higher relative pres- sures corresponding to the H3 type of hysteresis cycle. This is Fig. 1. XRD patterns of raw clay (1), Na-exchanged clay (2), AlFe10-PILC (3), and AlFe15-PILC (4).

Predrag BANKOVI � et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(1): 14–18 characteristic of aggregated plane particles that form slit shape pores [20,21]. Fig. 3 shows that AlFe15-PILC can adsorb more N 2 than the Na-exchanged sample. In all the samples, pores in the mesopore region (2–50 nm) prevail. The pore size distri- bution for the mesopores was calculated by the BJH method. The pore diameter at the maximum of derivative cumulative volume curves (D max ) and median value of pore diameter (D med ) are also given in Table 2. Table 2 shows the expected increase in the specific surface area, total pore volume, and micropore volume for the pillared samples compared with the non-pillared one. From the D max and D med values, it can be concluded that the pillaring process led to a shift of the mesopore fractions toward larger mesopore diameters. After synthesis and characterization, the obtained pillared clay catalysts were tested in the CWPO of toluene under the above defined conditions. The change in toluene concentration during the first two hours is presented in Fig. 4. The toluene concentration further decreased with time and after 24 h re- mained 0.8% and 4.6% of the initial concentration for AlFe15-PILC and AlFe10-PILC, respectively. The data showed that the synthesized catalysts were efficient in the wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation of toluene. Of the two catalysts, AlFe15-PILC showed better catalytic performance. With this catalyst, only 2.3% of the initial toluene amount (correspond- ing to 4 u 10 �6 of toluene) remained after 2 h of reaction. In order to check the chemical stability of the synthesized catalysts, the presence of inorganic cations in the reaction mixture was analyzed. The obtained ICP-OES spectra con- firmed that the Al 3+ and Fe 3+ ion concentrations in the filtrates taken after 24 h reaction did not exceed 0.01 mg/kg. These results showed that leaching was negligible and confirmed that the pillaring cations were well incorporated in the pillar structure. 3 Conclusions Two AlFe-pillared clays (PILCs) with different Fe contents were synthesized from bentonite clay. They were tested as catalysts for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) of toluene at 37 qC. Both catalysts were efficient catalysts with the catalyst richer in Fe showing the better catalytic perform- ance even though they did not differ in specific surface area and pore volume. The more efficient catalyst decreased the initial toluene concentration to 2.3% after 2 h and 0.8% after 24 h reaction. Both catalysts showed negligible leaching of the active cations during reaction. This work demonstrated the possibility of using PILCs in the CWPO of toluene. References [1] Mester K G, Kosson D S.

Tel: +381-11-2630213; Fax: +381-11-2637977 The catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) of toluene on two bentonite-based AlFe-pillared clays (PILCs) with different iron contents was investigated. The PILCs were obtained using bentonite clay from Bogovina, Serbia. The change in chemical and phase composition and textural properties of the starting clay and synthesized catalysts was monitored using X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry, and physisorption of nitrogen. The catalytic performance was examined using gas chromatography. The Na-exchange process lowered the (001) smectite basal plane spacing, but the clay retained its swelling properties, while the pillaring process increased it. The surface areas of both synthesized pillared clays increased to values although their Fecontent was different. At 37 °C, both catalysts show significant toluene degradation, with the one richer in Fe having higher efficiency. The leaching of the active cations during reaction was negligible, and the catalysts were stable. AlFe-pillared clay catalysts can be used in CWPO for the elimination of BTEX compounds from plant effluent streams.
