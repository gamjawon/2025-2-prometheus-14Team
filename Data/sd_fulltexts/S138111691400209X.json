Graphical abstract Fenton-like degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in aqueous solution was studied over a novel FeIII-containing polyoxometalate (POM) as heterogeneous catalyst. The POM, assigned as FeIIIAspPW12, was synthesized via precipitation reaction of phosphotungstic acid (PW12) with the complex of ferric ion and aspartic acid (Asp) in aqueous solution. The catalyst displays high activity and good reusability for oxidation of 4-CP by hydrogen peroxide in the range from acidic to circumneutral pH values. The enhanced oxidation of 4-CP was observed when the reaction system was irradiated by a high pressure mercury lamp. Under the conditions of H2O2 20mM, FeIIIAspPW12 0.2g/L, temperature 25±2°C and pH 6.5, the complete total organic carbon (TOC) removal for 100mg/L 4-CP solution could be achieved in both dark and irradiation systems within 120 and 60min, with H2O2 utilization of 77% and 83% respectively. It is speculated that the catalysis may possibly undergo the redox cycles of FeIII ⇌FeII and POM⇌POM− on the surface of FeIIIAspPW12, accompanied by hydroxyl radical formation from H2O2, and the oxidation of 4-CP consequently. Keywords Polyoxometalate Fenton-like 4-Chlorophenol Hydrogen peroxide Hydroxyl radical 1 Introduction Chlorophenols (CPs) are a group of important industrial chemicals, which have been widely used as disinfectants and preservative agents for wood, paints, vegetable fibers and leathers, due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They have also been applied in many industrial processes in manufacturing herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, insecticides, pharmaceuticals and dyes [1,2]. Most CPs are hardly biodegraded and removed from the environment. Thus, a large amount of industrial wastewater containing CPs is of great concern because of their toxicity and suspected carcinogenicity. Over the past decades, oxidative treatments of recalcitrant contaminants using Fenton's reagent (mixture of Fe2+/H2O2) have been extensively investigated [3–5]. Under acidic conditions, Fenton's reagent can rapidly generate high reactive hydroxyl radicals (HO•) which can mineralize most of the organic contaminants. The procedure involves the oxidation of Fe2+ with H2O2, producing hydroxyl radicals (reaction (1)). The generated Fe3+ may be reduced to Fe2+ by H2O2 (reaction (2)) [6,7]. (1) Fe2+ +H2O2 →Fe3+ +HO• +HO− (2) Fe3+ +H2O2 →Fe2+ +HO2 • +H+ Fe2+ plays the role of catalyst by transformation between Fe2+and Fe3+. However, the rate of reaction (1) is more rapid than that of reaction (2), Fe2+ transforms to Fe3+ eventually during the process. Fenton system is typically used under acidic conditions (ca. pH 3), as a result, the acidification and neutralization is required before and after the treatment [3]. The use of sufficient ferrous salt may yield almost stoichiometric hydroxyl radicals (reaction (1)). However, this is not advisable because the elimination of iron from the wastewater by neutralization at the end of the treatment may produce large amounts of iron sludge due to precipitation of amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide [3]. Heterogeneous Fenton-like system employing solid catalyst, which may be available over a wide pH range, provides a promising alternative for the oxidative treatment of organic pollutants. Recent years, many heterogeneous catalysts such as zero-valent iron [8,9], iron oxides [10–14] and other iron-containing materials [15–18] have been studied. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of metal-oxygen cluster heteropoly compounds that can undergo reversible redox reaction (POM⇌POM−) without structure change. POM can be photoexcited by absorbing UV photons and then the excited POM can capture an electron from organic substrates to be reduced. The reduced POM can be re-oxidized by oxidant (e.g. O2) in reaction system. Recently, studies on photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants using POMs as catalysts have received attention [19,20]. However, there have been a very few reports involving POMs in Fenton-like processes up to now [21–23]. In the present work, an insoluble FeIII-containing POM, denoted as FeIIIAspPW12, has been prepared by the precipitation reaction of phosphotungstic acid (PW12) with the complex of ferric ion and aspartic acid (Asp). Fenton-like degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in dark and irradiation systems has been studied respectively in the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system. The effect of initial parameters on the kinetics of 4-CP degradation has also been investigated. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Ferric chloride hexahydrate, 4-chlorophenol and n-butanol were purchased from Hangzhou Dayangchem Co., Ltd. Phosphotungstic acid and aspartic acid were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd. Hydrogen peroxide (30wt.%), methanol, n-butanol, and acetic acid were supplied by Beijing Chemical Factory. N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine was obtained from Shanghai ChemVia Co. Ltd. 2.2 Preparation and characterization of FeIIIAspPW12 The FeIIIAspPW12 was synthesized by precipitation reaction at ambient temperature. Ferric chloride hexahydrate (0.27g) and aspartic acid (0.13g) were dissolved in deionized water (25mL) to form a soluble complex between ferric ion and aspartic acid, followed by adding dropwise an aqueous solution of phosphotungstic acid (0.015mol/L, 25mL), resulting in brown precipitate. The mixture was stirred for 2h. The precipitate was collected by centrifuging, washed with deionized water, and dried in vacuum at 40°C. Elemental analyses of Fe, P, and W in FeIIIAspPW12 were performed on a Shimadzu ICPS-7510 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). Thermogravimetry curve (TG) was measured on a Seiko TG/DTA6300 thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer with a temperature ramp of 4°C per min under nitrogen atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 infrared spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with an XD-2 diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (1.5406Å) at 40kV and 30mA. 2.3 Experimental procedure Dark Fenton-like degradation of 4-CP was carried out at 25±2°C in a 200mL batch reactor, covered by an aluminum foil to avoid ambient light effect. Irradiated Fenton-like degradation of 4-CP was performed in a Pyrex reactor equipped a recirculation circuit for temperature control (25±2°C). A 400W high pressure mercury lamp was used as irradiation source with main emission wavelength 365nm. The light flux at the liquid level was measured to be ca. 450μW/cm2. A pH-adjusted 4-CP aqueous solution (100mg/L, 200mL) containing predetermined amount of FeIIIAspPW12 was firstly prepared. All the reactions were initiated by addition of the certain amount of H2O2. The suspension was under continuous magnetic stirring with 150rpm. Samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and immediately filtered through 0.22μm filter film to remove FeIIIAspPW12 powder. Meanwhile, 25μL of n-butanol was added to the 5mL samples to quench the reaction, and then, 4-CP concentration and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined. The reusability of the catalyst was evaluated under the same experimental conditions. The catalyst separated from the reaction solution was rinsed with deionized water, dried in vacuum and used in the next batch. Experiments were carried out in triplicate, and all the results were expressed as a mean value. 2.4 Sample analysis 4-CP was quantified by a high performance liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu LC-20AD) equipped with a LC-18 reversed-phase column and a diode array detector. The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol (65%) and 1% acetic acid aqueous solution (35%). Samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min and UV absorbance wavelength of 278nm. TOC was measured with a TOC-V CPH analyzer (Shimadzu). The concentration of H2O2 were quantified spectrophotometrically using a UV–vis 2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) by the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method [24]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of FeIIIAspPW12 The chemical formula of the synthesized FeIIIAspPW12 is proposed as [Fe(OOCCH2CHNH2COO)]3PW12O40·8H2O based on the ICP-AES and TG analyses. As shown in Table 1 , the ICP-AES data of P, W and Fe contents in FeIIIAspPW12 are in accordance with the results calculated based on the proposed chemical formula. TG curve of FeIIIAspPW12 exhibits two-step weight loss from 40 to 540°C (Fig. 1(a)). The 3.98% weight loss in the range of 40–176°C is ascribed to removal of water (calculated value 4.02%), and 10.70% weight loss from 176 to 481°C is attributed to decomposition of aspartate (calculated value10.98%). The FTIR spectrum of FeIIIAspPW12 displays a characteristic infrared fingerprint of Keggin structured PW12O40 3− anion (Fig. 1(b)) in the region of ca. 1100–700cm−1, which can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of PO (1067cm−1) bond in central PO4 unit, WO (964cm−1), and WOW (880 and 810cm−1) bonds of the WO6 cluster [20], implying the structural unit of PW12O40 3− anion in FeIIIAspPW12. Compared with FTIR spectrum of H3PW12O40·xH2O, some shifts of these four characteristic absorption peaks can be due to chemical interactions between PW12O40 3− anion and FeIII–aspartate complex unit. XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1(c) indicate that the synthesized FeIIIAspPW12 is amorphous, while its parent heteropoly acid H3PW12O40·xH2O is well crystalline. 3.2 Catalytic performance of FeIIIAspPW12 The degradation of 4-CP, TOC removal, and H2O2 decomposition at pH 6.5 (original pH of 100mg/L 4-CP solution) along time in the case of darkness and irradiation were investigated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . Whether the reaction was carried out in the dark or under irradiation, no obvious degradation of 4-CP was observed throughout 60min reaction in the presence of only H2O2 or only FeIIIAspPW12 individually (inset in Fig. 2). However, rapid decrease in 4-CP concentration and TOC was observed in the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system, and irradiation could significantly enhance the reaction efficiency for eliminating organics in solution. The time required for the complete degradation of 4-CP was ca. 60 and 30min in the case of darkness and irradiation respectively (Fig. 2), which correspond in turn to 120 and 60min required for complete TOC removal (Fig. 3). Notably, the rapid 100% TOC removal indicates that the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system can efficiently eliminate not only 4-CP, but also the intermediates formed during the procedure, which may give rise to further environmental problem. In a Fenton or Fenton-like system, H2O2 utilization efficiency should be assessed by the ratio of H2O2 amount needed for mineralizing 4-CP against actual consumed H2O2 in the process [14,16]. Based on the stoichiometry of the reaction (3), the mineralization of one mole 4-CP (assigned by 100% TOC removal) consumes 13 moles H2O2. Therefore, for complete TOC removal in 100mg/L 4-CP solution, the stoichiometric consumption of H2O2 is 10mM. As shown in Fig. 3, ca. 13 and 12mM of H2O2 were consumed respectively with complete TOC removal in the dark and under irradiation respectively. Then, the utilization efficiencies of H2O2 were calculated to be 77% in the dark and 83% under irradiation. It is noteworthy that, even in the case of darkness, the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system shows much higher efficiency of contaminant elimination and H2O2 utilization at the circumneutral pH than most of other heterogeneous Fenton-like systems using iron oxides and other iron-containing materials as catalysts. (3) C6H5OCl+13H2O2 →6CO2 +15H2O+HCl To evaluate the possibility of catalyst reuse, successive experiments were carried out at pH 6.5. As shown in Table 2 , the catalytic behavior of FeIIIAspPW12 is reproducible in consecutive experiments without a significant deactivation, indicating the high reusability of FeIIIAspPW12 for catalytic oxidization of 4-CP at circumneutral pH. 3.3 Stability of FeIIIAspPW12 and possible mechanism It is known that free PW12O40 3− anion in water gradually hydrolyzes to form PO4 3− and WO4 2− at neutral and alkaline pH values. To study the stability of FeIIIAspPW12 at pH 6.5, the catalyst was filtered after reaction (recover yield ca. 92%), the Fe, W and P contents in filtrate were determined by ICP-AES. The contents of Fe, W and P were 0.19, 2.5, 0.040ppm in dark system and 0.20, 2.7, 0.038ppm in irradiation system, suggesting that ca. 2% of FeIIIAspPW12 catalyst was dissolved or hydrolyzed during the degradation of 4-CP. To detect the heterogeneous nature of the catalytic process in the present case, the control experiments were carried out with the same amount of 4-CP, FeIIIAspPW12 catalyst and H2O2 in both dark and irradiation systems. A solution of 4-CP containing FeIIIAspPW12 was firstly stirred for 60min, and then the catalyst was filtrated. No degradation of 4-CP was observed with subsequent addition of H2O2 within the same reaction time. Therefore, the catalysis of FeIIIAspPW12 appears to occur on or near the surface of the catalyst. It should be noted that the polyperoxometalates such as {PO4[WO(O2)2]4}3− can be generated via the hydrogen peroxide mediated decomposition of free PW12O40 3− in aqueous solution [24]. However, no marked change was observed in the FTIR spectra of the recovered catalyst as shown in Fig. 1(b), indicating that the Keggin structure was retained in FeIIIAspPW12 after the reaction. Compared with free PW12O40 3− anion in water, the higher stability of PW12O40 3− in FeIIIAspPW12 at circumneutral pH may be ascribed to the fact that PW12O40 3− anion is immobilized in solid FeIIIAspPW12. In heterogeneous Fenton-like systems using iron-bearing materials as the catalysts, hydroxyl radical is usually proposed to be the dominant reactive species for oxidation of organics at acidic pH values. This proposal involves the redox cycle of FeIII ⇌FeII on the surface (assigned as FeIII and FeII), similar to the process occurred in homogeneous Fe2+/H2O2 system (reactions (4) and (5)) [7,13,14]. (4) FeIII +H2O2 → FeIII·H2O2 → FeII +HO2 • +H+ (5) FeII +H2O2 → FeII·H2O2 → FeIII +HO• +OH− FeIV species, which has lower reactivity compared with hydroxyl radical, is suggested to be the dominant oxidant generated at circumneutral pH values in Fe2+/H2O2 system [10,16]. However, lee et al. demonstrated that, under circumneutral pH conditions, the presence of silica-immobilized PW12O40 3− in Fe3+/H2O2 system resulted in the oxidant much more reactive than the FeIV species [22]. Additionally, they also suggested that coordination of PW12O40 3− with iron converted the active oxidant from FeIV to hydroxyl radical at circumneutral pH values [23]. To detect the reactive oxidant generated in the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system, n-butanol, a strong hydroxyl radial scavenger, was added before the addition of H2O2. It was found that the degradation of 4-CP was completely inhibited by 350mM n-butanol, whether the reaction system was in the dark or under irradiation, implying that the hydroxyl radicals were possibly the dominant oxidant for the oxidation of 4-CP [14]. For photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants with POM catalysts, reversible redox reaction of POM⇌POM− has been confirmed, in which electrons transfer from organics to excited POM, with the subsequent re-oxidization of reduced POM (POM−) by dissolved oxygen in water [20,25]. Recent studies have suggested that POM (PW12O40 3− or SiW12O40 4−) can also mediate electron transfer in the absence of irradiation from Fe0 or Fe2+ to O2, resulting in the formation of H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals subsequently [23]. In Fe2+/H2O2 homogeneous system, the formation rate of hydroxyl radical could be increased by photoreactions of H2O2 and/or Fe3+ that produce hydroxyl radical directly or regenerate Fe2+ (reactions (6) and (7)) to feed into reaction (1) [26]. (6) H2O2 + hν →2HO• (7) Fe(OH)2+ + hν →Fe2+ +HO• In the present FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system, it was suggested that the degradation of 4-CP probably involves the simultaneous redox cycles of FeIII ⇌FeII and POM⇌POM− on FeIIIAspPW12 surface, accompanied with electron transfer between FeIIIAspPW12 and H2O2 (or organics), leading to the decomposition of H2O2 and the production of oxidative species, such as hydroxyl radicals. Besides the directly photolysis of H2O2 to form hydroxyl radicals [26], UV light irradiation seems to also promote the electron transfer in such redox cycles, resulting in an increased efficiency of oxidant generation. However, the detailed reaction mechanism of 4-CP degradation in the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system is not precisely known; and much work is still needed. 3.4 Kinetics of 4-CP degradation As shown in Fig. 4 , whether the reaction was conducted in the dark or under irradiation, the degradation of 4-CP in the FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system was composed of an induction period (first stage) with no obvious degradation and a subsequent rapid degradation period (second stage). The whole process can be approximately modeled as two-stage pseudo first-order kinetics, which has been demonstrated in other heterogeneous Fenton-like systems [9,14,27,28]. As the degradation of 4-CP was significantly influenced by different initial parameters, i.e. pH, H2O2 concentration and catalyst dose, series comparative experiments were carried out to investigate the reaction kinetics. Except for the investigated parameter, all the experiments were conducted under the conditions of 4-CP 100mg/L, pH 6.5, H2O2 20mM, FeIIIAspPW12 0.2g/L and temperature 25±2°C. 3.4.1 Effect of initial pH As shown in Fig. 4(a), the degradation of 4-CP became very slow when pH value was 10.1. However, with lowering pH value, the degradation efficiency of 4-CP increased significantly. It can be observed that, a lower pH value caused a shorter induction period and a higher kinetic constant of second stage. For the degradation of 4-CP in the dark at initial pH values of 8.3, 6.5 and 3.2, respectively, the induction time was ca. 59, 40, and 33min, with second stage kinetic constants of 0.025, 0.309, and 0.541min−1 individually. The corresponding experiments under irradiation at these initial pH values resulted in the induction time of 31, 20, and 15min, and the second stage rate constants of 0.033, 0.623, 1.049min−1, respectively. It should be noticed that even at weak alkaline pH value of 8.3, the degradation of 4-CP can be achieved 68% within 100min in the dark, and 65% within 60min under irradiation, respectively. The increased degradation efficiency of 4-CP at lower pH values may be ascribed to a higher oxidation potential hydroxyl radical, and a higher stability of H2O2 that cannot be decomposed immediately to H2O and O2 [29–31]. 3.4.2 Effect of H2O2 initial concentration The effect of H2O2 initial concentration is shown in Fig. 4(b). It was found that, increasing H2O2 initial concentration from 10 to 20mM resulted in a shorter induction time and a higher kinetic constant of second stage in both dark and irradiated systems. When the experiments with initial H2O2 concentrations of 10 and 20mM were carried out in the dark, the induction time was ca. 63 and 40min, with corresponding second stage kinetic constants of 0.108 and 0.309min−1, respectively. Comparative experiments under irradiation with the same initial H2O2 concentrations resulted in the induction time of 29 and 20min, and second stage kinetic constants of 0.176 and 0.624min−1, respectively. However, with further increasing H2O2 concentration to 30mM, the induction time was not changed remarkably, and the kinetic constant of second stage decreased slightly both in dark and irradiated systems. The enhanced degradation efficiency of 4-CP with increasing H2O2 concentration from 10 to 20mM may be attributed to more hydroxyl radicals generated by decomposition of H2O2. However, the presence of excessive H2O2 (30mM) in solution can also scavenge hydroxyl radicals rapidly (reaction (8)) [32], resulting in slight decrease in 4-CP degradation efficiency. (8) HO• +H2O2 →H2O+HO2 • 3.4.3 Effect of catalyst dose The effect of the catalyst dose on degradation of 4-CP is illustrated in Fig. 4(c). With increasing catalyst dose from 0.2 to 1.0g/L, the induction time was cut short from 40 to 30min in the dark, 20 to 12min under irradiation, and kinetic constant of second stage was increased from 0.309 to 0.411min−1 in the dark, 0.624 to 1.033min−1 under irradiation, respectively. However, when the catalyst dose was further increased to 2.0g/L, the induction time was no longer changed obviously, and the kinetic constant of second stage was decreased slightly from 0.411 to 0.352min−1 in the dark, and 1.033 to 0.868min−1 under irradiation, respectively. The enhanced degradation efficiency of 4-CP resulted by raising catalyst dose from 0.2 to 1.0g/L could be ascribed to increased active sites on the surface of catalyst. Nevertheless, the presence of superfluous catalyst (2.0g/L) would result in agglomeration of particles [14,33,34], which led to slight decline of degradation efficiency of 4-CP. 4 Conclusions A Fe-containing POM FeIIIAspPW12 has been successfully synthesized to use as a novel heterogeneous catalyst in Fenton-like process for 4-CP degradation. The FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system exhibits high efficiency for 4-CP degradation and H2O2 utilization at circumneutral pH value. Irradiation can significantly accelerate 4-CP degradation and TOC removal. The catalyst is stable in consecutive Fenton-like procedures without obvious deactivation. The oxidant species generated in FeIIIAspPW12/H2O2 system appeared to be hydroxyl radicals. The catalysis of FeIIIAspPW12 possibly involves both redox cycles of FeIII ⇌FeII and POM⇌POM− on FeIIIAspPW12 surface, accompanied with electron transfer between FeIIIAspPW12 and H2O2 (organics), leading to the decomposition of H2O2 and the production of oxidative species. The degradation of 4-CP over the pH range from 3.2 to 8.3 can be modeled as two-stage pseudo first-order kinetics, consisting of an induction period (first stage) and a followed rapid degradation stage (second stage). The induction time and the kinetic constant of second stage depend on initial pH, H2O2 concentration and catalyst dosage. Owing to the high ability for H2O2 activation and the successive reusability, FeIIIAspPW12 is a promising alternative for catalytic degradation of other organic contaminants in heterogeneous Fenton-like systems.
