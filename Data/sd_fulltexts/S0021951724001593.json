Graphical abstract Understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation in high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation reactions is critical toward improving their energy and atom efficiency. In this work, we show that a partial overcoat of calcium oxide on a Pt-In alloy catalyst reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation by 10-fold during the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. During 20 h of time-on-stream at 600 °C in 5 % C2H6, the Ca-doped PtIn2 catalyst retains >85 % of its initial activity while the undoped PtIn2 deactivates to <20 %. Temperature-programmed oxidation and spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy reveal that the improved catalyst stability stems from enhanced migration of coke precursors away from the catalytically-relevant Pt sites to the silica support. Strikingly, the Ca overcoat does not alter the inherent rate and selectivity of coke formation but rather its crystallinity and localization, which nonetheless has a dramatic impact on the long-term performance of the catalyst.

Numerous platinum-based bimetallic alloy nanoparticles have been developed for alkane non-oxidative dehydrogenation, which show excellent selectivity toward the desired olefin product and significantly improved stability relative to monometallic Pt.[11–15] The commercial UOP Oleflex process for propane dehydrogenation utilizes a Pt-Sn catalyst supported on Al2O3, but the catalyst cokes rapidly under industrial reaction conditions.[16–18] In order to maintain high catalyst productivity, continuous catalyst regeneration is carried out to oxidatively remove coke and redisperse Pt. A deeper understanding of the factors that affect formation, migration, and crystallization of coke species is critical toward improving the stability of Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. A plethora of reports from the literature have shown that the addition of basic oxide species (Na, K, Mg, Ca, La) to supported Pt catalysts, particularly when using acidic supports such as Al2O3 or zeolites, are able to mitigate coke formation and increase catalyst stability in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.[19–23] In these examples, polymerization of coke precursors into larger graphitic species occurs at acidic sites on the support, which are neutralized by the basic additives.[24,25] A few examples have also postulated other effects of the alkaline and alkaline earth additives, including altering the reducibility of the alloying metal through mixed oxide formation, facilitating hydrogen spillover from the Pt nanoparticle to the support, and electronically modifying the Pt to accelerate C–H activation and weaken Pt–C bonds.[26–31] We were particularly intrigued by reports on Ca and K-modified Pt catalysts that suggested that the basic additives were capable of altering the chemical structure of the coke species formed and consequently their ability to migrate from metal active sites to the support.[32–34] However, no characterization of the spatial distribution of coke was performed to corroborate these hypotheses. In this work, we focus on the interaction between Ca additives and Pt alloy nanoparticles in non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) at 600 °C, using SiO2 as a relatively inert support to eliminate the potential contributions of support acidity. Calcium salts are added to stabilize a pre-synthesized PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst, which has been previously shown to be a highly selective but relatively unstable catalyst for EDH at 600 °C in a 5 % ethane, 95 % N2 feed.[35,36] We utilize spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy combined with temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) to characterize the structure and spatial distribution of coke on the catalyst and support after reaction. These data show that the enhanced catalyst stability in the presence of Ca stems from the formation of amorphous coke species that readily migrate away from active metal surface sites. 2 Experimental Synthesis of PtIn2/SiO2 nanoparticles by incipient wetness impregnation (iwi): iwi-PtIn2/SiO2 nanoparticles with 2 wt% Pt and 3 wt% In were synthesized based on a literature method.[35] In a 20 mL scintillation vial, In(NO3)·xH2O (0.56 g, 1.87 mmol) and citric acid (1.07 g, 5.6 mmol) were dissolved in 1.87 mL of nano pure water and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 by adding NH4OH. The In precursor solution was added dropwise to 7.00 g of SiO2 under continuous stirring followed by drying at 125 °C for 12 h and calcination at 600 °C for 3 h. In a separate 20 mL vial, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (284 mg, 0.73 mmol) was dissolved in 1.75 mL of nanopure water and 2.5 mL of NH4OH. The Pt precursor solution was then added dropwise to the 3 wt% In/SiO2 material and the resulting Pt-In powder was dried at 125 °C for 12 h and calcined at 225 °C for 3 h. Finally, the catalyst was reduced under 5 % H2/N2 flow at 250 °C for 0.5 h and then at 600 °C for 0.5 h. Impregnation of PtIn2/SiO2 nanoparticles with 6 wt% Ca: An additional iwi-step was performed to impregnate the SiO2 supported PtIn2 nanoparticles with calcium dopants. In a 20 mL scintillation vial, Ca(NO3)2)·4H2O (0.18 g, 0.75 mmol) and citric acid (0.48 g, 2.50 mmol) were dissolved in 200 μL of nanopure water and 150 μL of NH4OH. The Ca precursor solution was added dropwise to 0.5 g of iwi-PtIn2/SiO2 powder and the resulting Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 material was dried at 125 °C for 12 h and calcined at 600 °C for 3 h using a ramp rate of 2 °C/min. The catalyst was reduced in-situ under 5 % H2/N2 flow at 600 °C for 0.5 h. Similarly, Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 samples with 1.5 and 3 wt% Ca dopants were synthesized by modifying the loadings of calcium nitrate and citric acid. CO Chemisorption was performed on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 to measure the Pt dispersion before and after doping with Ca, Sr, and Nb. 100–500 mg of pelletized catalyst powders diluted with SiO2 were reduced in-situ in a U-shaped quartz reactor at 600 °C for 0.5 h under 5 % H2/He flow. The CO chemisorption measurements were performed at 35 °C and Pt dispersion was calculated by assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between Pt and CO. Raman Spectroscopy and Mapping were performed using a DXRxi Raman Imaging Microscope equipped with OMNICxi Raman imaging software. Raman spectra were collected using a 532 nm excitation wavelength with ∼ 4.1 mW of power at the sample and an exposure time of 0.0714 s. Each Raman spectrum was collected with 12 accumulations. Raman maps were obtained using a 10x standard working distance objective with 5 accumulations to minimize sample damage under otherwise identical conditions. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) measurements were done on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 Chemisorption analyzer with an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (Cirrus 3, MKS Instruments) tracking NH3 (m/z = 17), H2O (m/z = 18), N2 (m/z = 28), O2 (m/z = 32), and CO2 (m/z = 44). All species were quantified using a Faraday cup detector. The concentration of CO2 was quantified via calibration with 0.051 kPa CO2/He gas cylinder (512 ppm CO2 UHP, Indiana Oxygen) diluted to varying extents with another He stream (UHP, Indiana Oxygen) to generate a calibration curve. This calibration was performed before each O2-TPO experiment and the value was taken as the response factor for each experiment. Integration of the CO2 signal was performed using the trapezoidal rule. For a representative O2-TPO experiment, 33–58 mg of sieved PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst or SiO2 diluent treated under EDH conditions for > 20 h were loaded into a U-tube quartz reactor with plugs of quartz wool to support the catalyst bed. The sample was first treated in air (Zero Grade Air, Indiana Oxygen; 0.83 cm3 s−1) at 250 °C (0.167 deg s−1) for 30 min. A temperature ramp was then carried out in air from 250 °C to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 0.167 deg s−1 and held at 800 °C for 30 min. TPO was also carried out on an untreated, blank SiO2 sample to verify that no CO2 was evolving from the SiO2 alone. The quantity of CO2 evolved from each sample (in μmol) was normalized to the amount of catalyst loaded for each measurement. The total quantity of CO2 evolved per gram of sample includes both temperature hold periods at 250 °C and 800 °C as well as the temperature ramp. Additional materials synthesis and physical characterization techniques are described in the Supporting Information. 2.1 Catalytic methods Ethane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a quartz reactor tube (9.5 mm ID). The mass of the catalyst sample ranged from 20 to 150 mg, depending on the desired conversion. The catalyst was diluted with high purity SiO2 (Davisil grade 633) to maintain a total loading of 1000 mg and catalyst bed height of 12.7 mm. In order to separate the catalyst from the SiO2 diluent after reaction, the catalyst fraction (PtIn2/SiO2 or Ca-PtIn2/SiO2) was pelletized to 250–325 µm, and the high purity SiO2 diluent was pelletized to 425–700 µm. No evidence of settling or segregation of the two pellet sizes is observed over 24 h ( Figure S25 ). A thermocouple was positioned at the bottom of the catalyst bed in order to measure the reaction temperature within the bed. All catalysts are reduced in-situ under 5 % H2 with balance N2 at 600 °C for 30 min. For standard EDH reactions, the reaction was run at 600 °C using a gas mixture of 5 % C2H6 with balance N2 at 100 cm3 min−1 total flow. For EDH with H2-cofeed, the reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 % C2H6, 1 % H2, and balance N2 at 100 cm3 min−1 total flow. Gas-phase products were monitored with an online gas chromatograph. Apparent activation energies (Ea) and turnover frequencies (TOF) were obtained through EDH measurements across a range of temperatures (550–620 °C) in a gas mixture of 32 % C2H6 and balance N2 at 74 cm3 min−1, and the initial ethane conversion was kept below 10 %. The reaction rate was assumed to be constant throughout the reactor and modeled using the following equation: (1) r = q ( C 2 H 6 0 - [ C 2 H 6 ] ) W where r is the observed rate of reaction (mol C2H6 gcat -1 s−1), q is the volumetric flow rate of C2H6 (mL min−1), [C2H6]0 is the initial C2H6 concentration (mol C2H6 mL−1), [C2H6] is the C2H6 concentration (mol C2H6 mL−1), and W is the mass of the catalyst (g). 2.2 Calculation of first-order deactivation rate constant (kd ) Assuming that catalyst deactivation follows a concentration-independent first-order deactivation model, we calculated the deactivation rate constant for both the overall reaction rate (kd ) and the forward reaction rate (kd-f ). The overall rate of ethane conversion (r) at any time during the catalytic reaction is defined above in Equation (1). The forward rate (rf , Eq. (6) can then be calculated from r based on the approach to equilibrium parameter (η, Eq. (5) and the equilibrium constant (Keq) of the ethane dehydrogenation reaction under specific temperature and pressure conditions (600 °C, 0.050 atm).[37] Thermodynamic parameters for this reaction were calculated from tabulated data in Research Project 44 of the American Petroleum Institute ( Figure S1 ).[38] A first-order deactivation model is then applied to relate kd over a specified time period (t) to r and the initial rate of ethane conversion (r0 , Eq. 2–4, 7).[39] Non-linear regression was utilized to fit the data to an exponential decay model. Curve fitting results are provided in Figures S7-S9 and Tables S3-S4. In this work, kd and kd-f values are reported after 2 h of time-on-stream for the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 sample and 6 h for the Ca-doped sample. Several additional deactivation models were considered for fitting the data, which are described in detail in the Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst Characterization and Activity We synthesized SiO2-supported PtIn2 nanoparticles with a loading of 2 wt% Pt and 3 wt% In based on an incipient wetness impregnation (iwi) method reported in the literature.[35] The PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst was then impregnated with Ca(NO3)2 at 6 wt% loading followed by calcination at 600 °C for 3 h. Finally, the Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst was reduced under 5 % H2 with balance N2 at 600 °C for 30 min prior to EDH reactions. High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging of both the undoped and Ca-doped materials show 2–4 nm nanoparticles supported on SiO2 (Fig. 1 a, S2-S3). EDS mapping reveals that Pt atoms are co-localized with the high contrast nanoparticles present in the HAADF-STEM image while Ca and In are distributed on both the support and the nanoparticles. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that Pt-In nanoparticles adopt a calcium fluoride (CaF2) crystal structure, as expected for the PtIn2 composition in both the undoped and Ca-doped materials (Fig. 1 b). In the doped material, sharp peaks corresponding to calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are also observed, indicating that calcium species crystallize independently of the Pt-In nanoparticles. To probe the effect of Ca dopants on the electronic properties of Pt in the alloy nanoparticles, we examined the X-ray absorption near edge spectra at the Pt LIII edge on the Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 1 c). The minor changes in white line intensity and edge energy of the PtIn2 nanoparticles after Ca deposition implies that there is minimal perturbation of the electronic structure of the Pt alloy. In the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), similar Pt–In and Pt–Pt scattering peaks between 1 and 3 Å in both the undoped and Ca-doped samples show that the PtIn2 nanoparticles remain alloyed after Ca impregnation (Fig. 1 d). A significant drop in Pt dispersion from 12 % in the undoped PtIn2 nanoparticles to 1.5 % in the 6 wt% Ca-doped sample reveals that a significant number of surface Pt sites are masked by the Ca deposition ( Table S1 ). We then studied the behavior of these catalysts in the non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) reaction at 600 °C using a gas mixture containing 5 % C2H6 and N2 balance. Conversions were varied by diluting different amounts of 2 wt% PtIn2/SiO2 or Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 (20 to 150 mg) with blank SiO2 to load a total of 1000 mg in the reactor (Fig. 2 a, S4). In general, because the Ca-doped samples have significantly lower Pt dispersion compared to the undoped PtIn2/SiO2, larger quantities of catalyst are required for the Ca-doped sample to achieve comparable conversions. All catalysts are reduced in-situ under 5 % H2 with balance N2 at 600 °C for 30 min. Ca-doped catalysts typically activate slightly over the first 30–60 min. of the EDH reaction, so maximum conversions rather than initial conversions are used for comparison in Fig. 2b and 2c. Over a broad range of conversions, both undoped and Ca-doped PtIn2/SiO2 catalysts show > 99 % selectivity towards ethylene based only on gas-phase products (Fig. 2 b), and less than 1 % monomolecular cracking to methane is observed. All reactions have carbon balance > 93 % ( Figure S5 ). In addition, Ca-doped and undoped PtIn2/SiO2 catalysts show similar apparent activation energies, suggesting that the PtIn2 alloy is the active surface in both catalysts ( Figure S6 , Table S2 ). While the selectivity as a function of conversion is unchanged by Ca doping, a significant deviation in catalyst stability is observed. Across all catalyst loadings, undoped PtIn2/SiO2 deactivates significantly over the first four hours while Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 remains relatively stable (Fig. 2 a). To more quantitatively assess the deactivation rate across all samples, we fit the activity data over time to several deactivation models including Levenspiel’s Deactivation Kinetic Models (LDKM) and Deactivation Models with Residual Activity (DMRA).[40] LDKM assumes that all catalyst active sites deactivate with constant rate and kinetic order, eventually reaching zero activity at sufficiently long reaction times.[39] In contrast, DMRA presumes that the catalyst reaches a non-zero steady state activity, which stems from a reversible deactivation process or the retention of some active sites that cannot be deactivated.[41] Additional details, fitting parameters, and confidence intervals for all of the models considered are provided in the Supporting Information. We find that the undoped PtIn2 activity data in the first 2 h fits well to a simple concentration-independent, first-order deactivation model (Eq. 2–4) ( Figure S7-S8 , Table S3 ). This model assumes that both the reactant ethane and the product ethylene are capable of converting to a poisoning species, which is a reasonable assumption in the high-temperature, reductive EDH environment.[42–44] Concentration-dependent models, in which the poisoning species is formed exclusively from either reactant or product, or models of varying deactivation order do not significantly improve the quality of the fit ( Figure S10-S11 ). Upon Ca-doping, the activity over time curves do not fit as well to any of the LDKM models, likely because the catalyst retains non-zero steady-state activity, which is more accurately described by DMRA ( Figure S7, S9 , Table S4 ).[27] However, accurate fitting of DMRA requires catalytic data that has reached steady state, which may not be the case for the short reaction times shown in Fig. 2a.

(4) lnr = l n r 0 - k d t In order to compare relative deactivation rates over both undoped and Ca-doped samples across a broad range of initial conversions, we apply the simple first-order deactivation model shown in Eq. 2–4 to all of our activity data, acknowledging that the model may be imperfect for the Ca-doped catalyst. The first-order deactivation constant (kd ) for ethane conversion is plotted as a function of maximum conversion in Fig. 2c. All Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 catalysts maintain a low kd value (<0.1 h−1) independent of catalyst loading and conversion. Compared to the PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst at comparable ethane conversion (∼15 %), the Ca-doped sample exhibits a 10-fold lower deactivation rate. On the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst, the deactivation rate decreases as the conversion increases due to the higher loadings of Pt catalyst. EDH is an equilibrium-limited reaction, so the catalytic performance when operating near equilibrium appears stabilized due to an underutilization of metal active sites. To probe the inherent deactivation rate of the undoped catalyst, we also utilize the approach to equilibrium parameter (η, Eq. (5) to obtain a forward rate of reaction (r f, Eq. (6) and consequently, a deactivation rate for only the forward direction (kd-f , Eq. (7).[37] (5) η = C 2 H 4 [ H 2 ] K eq C 2 H 6 (6) r f = r ( 1 - η ) (7) ln r f = l n r 0 f - k d - f t The kd values and kd-f values diverge significantly as the ethane conversions approach the equilibrium value of 52 % (Fig. 2 c). Except for the highest conversion experiment, where the large η value of 0.88 causes significant error in the rf calculation, k d-f for each catalyst remains relatively constant across all conversions. An average kd-f of 0.48 ± 0.018 h−1 is observed over the undoped PtIn2 catalyst compared to 0.036 ± 0.012 h−1 over the Ca-doped catalyst. Based on this analysis, the Ca overcoat reduces the inherent EDH deactivation rate of PtIn2 nanoparticles by 13-fold. To investigate the long-term stability of the two catalysts, we examined their catalytic performance over 20 h of time-on-stream (Fig. 2 d). For the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 at low loading (20 mg), a steep decline in ethane conversion from 27 % to 5 % over 20 h, a loss of 81 % of the initial activity, indicates significant loss of Pt active sites due to rapid coking. Although increasing catalyst loading to 100 mg slows catalyst deactivation, the ethylene yield still declines by 59 % over a 20 h period, corroborating the fact that higher catalyst loading does not alter the inherent rate of active site loss in PtIn2/SiO2 ( Figure S12 ). On the Ca-doped nanoparticles, a lower initial reactivity is consistent with the 5 times lower Pt dispersion upon Ca deposition on the nanoparticle surface. However, the Ca dopants drastically improve the stability of PtIn2 nanoparticles, and the catalyst loses < 15 % of its initial ethane conversion after 20 h on stream. For endothermic reactions such as EDH, the stability of the catalyst during long-term operation is more important than the inherent catalyst turnover frequency because the reactor will typically be operated at or near equilibrium conversion.[45–47] While higher loadings for the Ca-doped catalyst will be required relative to the undoped catalyst to achieve equilibrium conversion, the increase in catalyst stability will enable longer catalyst lifetimes and longer periods between regeneration steps under practical operating conditions. The long-term catalytic data can now be modeled using DMRA, assuming that deactivation due to coking is reversible and leads to residual activity at steady state.[27,41] The undoped PtIn2 data fits relatively poorly to DMRA, where neither the fast deactivation in the early time regime nor the slow deactivation in the late time regime is captured by the model, corroborating our earlier finding that LDKM is more appropriate for the undoped catalyst ( Figure S13 , Table S7 ). The Ca-doped PtIn2 data, in contrast, shows a fairly good fit to DMRA, which enables determination of rate constants for both deactivation (ψd) and regeneration (ψr), i.e. the process by which poisoning species are removed from the active site. In this case, we obtain a ψd of 0.042 and ψr of 0.17, leading to a residual activity of 80 %. In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the reversibility of coke formation is enhanced in the presence of co-fed H2, which can hydrogenate coke precursors and regenerate poisoned active sites.[45] Though our reactions do not include any co-fed H2, we believe that Ca plays a similar role in facilitating coke migration off of metal active sites and onto the support. Interestingly, the catalytic performance is sensitive to Ca loading and impregnation sequence. Modest improvements in catalytic stability are observed at reduced Ca loadings of 1.5 and 3 wt%, suggesting that a high loading is necessary for a uniform Ca overcoat on the PtIn2 nanoparticles ( Table S1 , Figure S14 ). Reversing the sequence, by first impregnating the SiO2 support with 6 wt% Ca followed by addition of Pt and In precursors (PtIn2/Ca-SiO2), results in kd and kd-f values similar to the undoped catalyst ( Table S1 , Figure S15 ). These data suggest that modification of the support acidity or the metal–support interaction through Ca doping of the SiO2 alone is not sufficient to alter deactivation behavior in this catalyst. Comparison catalytic experiments using Sr-doped and Nb-doped PtIn2/SiO2, which respectively comprise a basic alkaline earth ion similar in properties to Ca and a metal capable of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) with monometallic Pt, showed little effect on the rate of deactivation ( Table S1 , Figure S16-S17 ).[48–52] Calcium appears to be unique in its ability to interact with PtIn2 alloy nanoparticles and suppress catalyst deactivation in the high temperature EDH reaction. We postulate that the interaction of CaO and InOx is critical toward the formation of a uniform overlayer on the PtIn2 nanoparticles. The classical reductive SMSI layer forms because of a strong interaction between the Pt0 surface and a partially-reduced metal oxide species.[53] The presence of the alloying metal will necessarily disrupt that key interaction and may limit formation of the SMSI layer using metal oxides such as Nb2O5 or TiO2.[54] In the Ca-doped PtIn2 system, we hypothesize that a mixed Ca-In oxide layer forms on the surface of the preformed PtIn2 nanoparticle after impregnation of the calcium precursor, which leaves behind the CaO overlayer after reduction in H2.[55,56]. While both sintering and coking could contribute to loss of Pt active sites during EDH, STEM analysis of both catalysts after 20 h of EDH shows that the undoped and Ca-doped PtIn2 nanoparticles grow only slightly and by comparable amounts during catalysis ( Figure S2-S3, S18-S19 ). We postulate that nanoparticle sintering is not the dominant deactivation pathway under these EDH conditions. As a result, we turned to more detailed characterization of the coke species formed during EDH to understand the mechanism by which Ca improves the catalytic stability. 3.2 Coke characterization by TPO We utilized temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) to study the carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst bed after EDH for 20 h. To compare the doped and undoped catalysts, we used two different catalyst loadings (20 mg PtIn2/SiO2 and 100 mg Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 balanced with blank SiO2) to match the initial conversions. Additionally, we performed the identical EDH catalytic experiment and TPO characterization on a 100 mg loading of undoped PtIn2/SiO2 to ensure that the differences in catalyst loading were not responsible for the changes in the TPO data ( Figure S12, S20 ). In order to assess the spatial location of coke, we pelletized the 2 wt% Pt catalysts supported on SiO2 and the blank SiO2 diluent at 250–325 µm and 425–700 µm sizes, respectively. We were then able to separate the catalyst fraction from the SiO2 diluent fraction after catalysis and characterize the coke deposited on each fraction. By examining the CO2 evolution signal as a function of temperature on both fractions, we can determine the amount of carbon accumulated on Pt alloy sites, SiO2 in the vicinity of metal nanoparticles, and SiO2 distal from the alloy particles (Fig. 3 ). The as-synthesized “fresh” catalysts were also analyzed to account for baseline carbon signal from the residual organic species used in the synthesis. Conventionally, amorphous or nanocrystalline carbon species can be oxidatively removed at < 450 °C, metal-assisted combustion of graphitic coke occurs from 450 to 525 °C, and graphitic carbon on SiO2 burns off at temperatures above 525 ℃.[34,57–60] On the catalyst fraction of undoped PtIn2, a sharp peak at 490 ℃ is indicative of a significant quantity of crystalline coke deposited on Pt alloy surface sites. The prevalence of coke on the metal alloy sites is consistent with the observed deactivation of undoped PtIn2/SiO2 during EDH due to loss of active Pt sites. A broad feature below 450 °C also indicates the presence of poorly-crystalline or nanocrystalline carbon species. In contrast, the catalyst fraction of spent Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 sample shows no peak between 450 and 525 °C, suggesting that Ca dopants suppress deposition of graphitic coke on the metal alloy surface. A major peak is observed at ∼ 560 ℃, but an identical feature is also present in the as-synthesized Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 sample and can be attributed to residual carbonaceous species, CaCO3 and C, generated during the decomposition of calcium citrate precursors.[61] These species persist during the calcination in static air at 600 °C but are more efficiently removed during the TPO experiment when actively sweeping CO2 out of the product stream.[62,63] The shoulder feature between 375 and 450 °C shows that a small quantity of amorphous and nanocrystalline carbon species are also deposited. The lack of any graphitic carbon species on the catalyst fraction of Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 is consistent with its stable catalytic performance in EDH. Comparing the total quantity of CO2 evolved, the undoped catalyst clearly has a much larger quantity of coke on its catalyst fraction compared to the Ca-doped sample. On the diluent SiO2 fraction, both the Ca-doped and undoped PtIn2 show a dominant feature at 325 ℃, which corresponds to amorphous carbon species on SiO2. A smaller quantity of carbon is present as nanocrystalline coke species between 350 and 450 °C and fully-crystallized graphitic C from 525 to 600 °C. Notably, the quantity of coke on the diluent fraction is higher on the Ca-doped PtIn2 compared to undoped PtIn2/SiO2, inverted from the situation on the catalyst fraction. For Ca-doped PtIn2/SiO2, we believe that elimination of graphitic carbon on the metal surface and enhancement of amorphous carbon on the distal support fraction stems from efficient migration of amorphous carbon or other small coke precursors off of metal sites prior to crystallization into graphite. The efficient “drain-off” of early-stage coke precursors has also been proposed for the stability of Pt-Sn alloy catalysts compared to monometallic Pt in alkane dehydrogenation.[7,47,64–67]. We also quantitatively analyzed the TPO data to assess several distinct metrics: the weight percent of coke on each fraction, the total coke in the reactor bed, and the selectivity to coke based on the total ethane converted during the reaction. The weight percent of coke on each fraction can be obtained directly from integration of the TPO data shown in Figure 3 and S20. As is obvious from the traces themselves, the coke quantity is much higher on the catalyst fraction for the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 experiment at both 20 mg and 100 mg catalyst loading, reaching 1.3 wt% and 2.3 wt% of carbon, respectively (Fig. 4 a). In contrast, the Ca-PtIn2/SiO2 only has 0.24 wt% carbon on its catalyst fraction. The inverse is true for the diluent fraction, where the Ca-doped sample now has 0.45 wt% carbon while undoped PtIn2 has only 0.13 wt% and 0.24 wt% at 20 mg and 100 mg, respectively. In general, the total weight percent of carbon on the diluent fraction is considerably lower than on the catalyst fraction simply because there is a much larger mass of diluent (900–980 mg) compared to catalyst (20–100 mg). Multiplying the wt.% coke by the loadings of catalyst and diluent for each reaction, we can then calculate the total mass of coke in the reactor bed (Fig. 4 b). At the 20 mg loading of undoped PtIn2/SiO2, the majority of the coke is located on the diluent fraction simply because there is so little catalyst in the bed to support the coke that is generated. However, the differences in coke localization are more obvious when comparing the doped and undoped catalysts at the same loading of catalyst (100 mg catalyst, 900 mg diluent). In this case, a very similar quantity of total coke is present in the reactor bed, but the undoped catalyst has 53 % of its carbon deposits on the catalyst fraction while the Ca-doped sample has only 6 % of its coke on the catalyst fraction. Finally, we normalize the quantity of coke generated by the amount of ethane converted during the 20 h of reaction in order to obtain a selectivity to coke (Fig. 4 c). Because these coke selectivities are < 1 % across all reactions, mass balance is not sufficiently accurate to quantify the percentage of ethane that is being converted to coke. Undoped PtIn2, regardless of catalyst loading, shows ∼ 0.22 % selectivity to forming coke. The distribution varies with catalyst loading, and deposition of carbon on the catalyst fraction is favored when a higher mass of catalyst is used in the reaction. Interestingly, the Ca-PtIn2 actually shows a slightly higher selectivity of 0.36 % towards coke formation compared to undoped PtIn2, despite its much better stability during EDH catalysis. However, the coke deposition noticeably skews toward the diluent fraction, and very little coke remains on the catalyst fraction. Combined, the qualitative and quantitative TPO analysis indicates that Ca dopants facilitate the migration of loosely bound and amorphous carbon species from Pt active sites to the surrounding SiO2, resulting in stable EDH turnover despite very similar propensities to generate coke during the reaction. 3.3 Coke characterization by Raman mapping In addition to TPO, we performed Raman spectroscopy on the spent catalyst and diluent fractions for both Ca-doped and undoped catalyst to gain further information about the structure and spatial distribution of carbon deposits. Two major Raman bands are typically observed in graphitic carbon species. The G (1580 cm−1) and D1 (1340 cm−1) bands represent the vibrational modes for the E2g symmetry and in-plane defects of graphitic carbon. The broad D3 band at ∼ 1500 cm−1 represents amorphous carbon.[59,68] Comparing the average Raman spectra for each spent fraction, we find that the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst fraction shows the sharpest and highest intensity graphitic features with clear peaks corresponding to the D1 and G bands of graphite (Fig. 5 a). A relatively small contribution due to the amorphous D3 peak is observed. Interestingly, the diluent fraction for the undoped catalyst does not show detectable carbon peaks in the Raman, corroborating the very low density of coke on the diluent fraction observed by TPO and the absence of coke migration from the catalyst fraction where it is generated to distal SiO2 particles in the diluent. In contrast, the Ca-doped PtIn2/SiO2 shows similar Raman intensities in the graphite region for both the catalyst and diluent fractions, clearly indicating a greater propensity for coke to migrate over long distances to the diluent SiO2 (Fig. 5 c). In addition, a much larger contribution due to the D3 band, the amorphous carbon species, relative to the crystalline D1 and G bands is observed. The Raman bands on the diluent fraction are broader and less well-defined than those on the catalyst fraction, suggesting that the coke species that are able to migrate to distal SiO2 particles comprise smaller molecular units and lower crystallinity. To more clearly understand the spatial distribution of coke in these catalysts, Raman mapping was performed on the catalyst fractions of both the Ca-doped and undoped materials. We find that the incipient wetness impregnation is inherently uneven at the micron scale, with Pt-In alloy nanoparticles clustered more densely onto some support particles, which gives them a noticeably darker hue in the optical microscopy images before catalysis ( Figure S21 ). Because of these large aggregates, confocal Raman spectroscopy has sufficient spatial resolution to correlate the distribution of coke to the areas of high nanoparticle density in the optical image. For each sample, we collected optical images and Raman spectra with ∼ 10 μm spatial resolution in three distinct areas. The Raman intensity map is generated from the intensity of the D1 peak at 1340 cm−1, which serves as a proxy for the quantity of coke in any given pixel. Similar spatial maps are obtained when using the intensity of the G peak at 1580 cm−1. Aggregates with high nanoparticle density, based on the optical image, are marked in the white outlines. One representative region for each catalyst is shown in Fig. 5, and additional regions are provided in Figures S22 and S23. In the undoped catalyst fraction, high Raman intensities are observed across the entire surface, regardless of whether the area is nanoparticle-rich or SiO2-rich (Fig. 5 b). Except when off the sample altogether, the D1 peak intensity values range from 300 to 1800 AU, all of which are higher than the maximum intensity on the Ca-doped catalyst. No spatial correlation exists between the dark nanoparticle-dense regions and the areas of highest coke intensity. In contrast, the Ca-doped catalyst fraction shows much lower Raman intensities across the surface with only a few spots reaching a maximum intensity of ∼ 200 AU (Fig. 5 d). There appears to be an anti-correlation between the nanoparticle-rich areas and the distribution of coke. The dark regions in the optical image that represent areas of high nanoparticle density show low intensities for coke while areas in the vicinity of the dark patches that appear sparse in nanoparticles are significantly more coke-rich. Together, these data corroborate the TPO and average Raman spectra indicating that the Ca-overcoat facilitates coke migration away from the Pt alloy nanoparticles and onto the support. The increased coke migration is likely also related to the lower crystallinity of the carbonaceous species, since amorphous and smaller aggregates of carbon are more mobile under reaction conditions. We anticipate that Ca plays a dual role in enhancing EDH stability, inhibiting crystallization of amorphous coke precursors into large graphitic aggregates and enhancing migration of these small coke species away from the Pt-In alloy where they are generated and onto the support. The adhesion of graphitic carbon is known to depend strongly upon both the electronic interaction of the π-orbitals and geometric alignment of the hexagonal graphite lattice to the underlying surface structure. In both instances, coke precursors would be expected to adhere much more strongly to a metal or metal alloy compared to an insulating oxide material.[69–72]. 3.4 Impact of Co-feeding H2 One of the most common strategies in the literature for improving catalyst stability in high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation is to incorporate a significant ratio of H2 in the feed, motivating us to study how the combination of Ca doping and H2 cofeeding would influence coke formation and transport.[7,13,30,73–75] For the undoped PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst, co-feeding H2 and lowering ethane content in the reactant gas feed does significantly improve catalytic stability, reducing the kd-f from 0.48 to 0.16 h−1 (Fig. 6 a). TPO on the spent catalyst fraction reveals that the prominent peak at 390 °C arising from graphitic coke deposited on Pt sites is almost completely eliminated, leaving primarily the lower temperature peak attributed to amorphous and nanocrystalline carbon (Fig. 6 b). On the diluent fraction, the feature at 550 °C grows due to graphitic C that has migrated onto the diluent SiO2 (Fig. 6 c). Integration of the TPO profiles shows that the H2 cofeed does not reduce the total selectivity toward coke but does shift the distribution of graphitic coke from the catalyst fraction onto the diluent fraction ( Figure S24 , 4c). In the Ca-doped PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst, ethane conversion remains highly stable with the H2 cofeed (Fig. 6 a) and relatively similar to the ethane-only condition (Fig. 2 d). The deactivation rate kd-f over 20 h is essentially zero under these conditions. TPO of both the catalyst and diluent fractions look nearly identical to the pure ethane feed, showing primarily amorphous and nanocrystalline carbon species (Fig. 6 b, c), and the total selectivity toward coke is unchanged ( Figure S24 , 4c). These data suggest that cofeeding H2 has relatively little effect on the Ca-doped sample and may in fact play a similar role as the Ca additives in slowing down coke crystallization and promoting migration of coke species from the metal sites of the catalyst onto SiO2. Ca additives appear to be more efficient than H2 at inhibiting graphitic carbon formation based on the minimal TPO features at > 550 °C in either fraction of the Ca-PtIn2/SiO2. We believe that Ca-doping will serve as a complementary strategy to H2 cofeeding in applications that necessitate H2-poor environments, e.g. membrane reactors.[76]. In conclusion, we developed a calcium impregnation strategy to mitigate catalyst deactivation of SiO2-supported PtIn2 nanoparticles in ethane dehydrogenation. Ca-doped PtIn2/SiO2 catalyst shows much greater catalytic stability over 20 h compared to its undoped counterpart. TPO and Raman mapping experiments on the spent catalyst reveal that the Ca overcoat on PtIn2 inhibits coke crystallization and facilitates migration of amorphous carbon from Pt metal sites to both vicinal and distal SiO2 support areas. As a result, Pt active sites remain available for catalysis despite the generation of coke.

        "dc:description": "Understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation in high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation reactions is critical toward improving their energy and atom efficiency. In this work, we show that a partial overcoat of calcium oxide on a Pt-In alloy catalyst reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation by 10-fold during the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. During 20 h of time-on-stream at 600 °C in 5 % C2H6, the Ca-doped PtIn2 catalyst retains >85 % of its initial activity while the undoped PtIn2 deactivates to <20 %. Temperature-programmed oxidation and spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy reveal that the improved catalyst stability stems from enhanced migration of coke precursors away from the catalytically-relevant Pt sites to the silica support. Strikingly, the Ca overcoat does not alter the inherent rate and selectivity of coke formation but rather its crystallinity and localization, which nonetheless has a dramatic impact on the long-term performance of the catalyst.",
