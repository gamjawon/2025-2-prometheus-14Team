Graphical abstract Lanthanum phosphate catalysts have been synthesized in 3 different techniques such as (i) simple co-precipitation (LaP-1), (ii) co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal treatment (LaP-2) and (iii) pH variation method (6LaP-3 the prefixed 6 denotes the flocculated pH). Lanthanum and phosphate concentration in all the catalysts is constant (La/P=1) irrespective of method of preparation. All the 3 catalysts (LaP-1, LaP-2 and 6LaP-3) prepared by different methods are used as catalysts for the O-methylation of phenol and found that the catalyst prepared by pH variation method (6LaP-3) exhibited better activity. A series of catalysts with La/P=1 by pH variation method (2LaP-3, 6LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3) have been prepared and characterized by FT-IR, X-ray diffraction and BET surface area to obtain the structural and textural information. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 studies of LaP-3 catalysts revealed the distribution and strength of acidic and basic sites respectively. LaP-3 catalysts are in hexagonal and rhabdophane phases (XRD). The LaP-3 catalysts are highly active and selective towards formation of anisole via methylation of phenol with methanol in the vapor phase. 2LaP-3 is the best catalyst among the LaP-3 catalyst series in the catalytic activity point of view. Weak and moderate acidic sites along with basic sites might have contributed for the high conversion of phenol and good selectivity of anisole. Keywords Lanthanum phosphate Phenol Methanol Anisole 1 Introduction Production of anisole by selective O-methylation of phenol with methanol is an industrially important reaction because of its alluring industrial applications. Anisole is extensively used in the production of perfumes, insect pheromones, phenol-formaldehyde resins, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics [1–4] and also an important chemical intermediate for synthesizing guaiacol, MEHQ (Mono methyl ether of hydroxyl quinine) and 4-MAP (4-Methoxy acetophenone). Besides, it is utilized in the manufacture of nanoparticles and inorganic complexes. Commercially anisole being produced by based on the Williamson’s ether synthasis wherein phenol, methyl bromide and alkaline sodium compounds are used. Traditionally, for the synthesis of anisole Friedel–Crafts catalysts such as AlCl3, BF3, TiCl4 and liquid HF are being utilized. However, disposal of effluents, corrosiveness, low reaction selectivity, catalyst separation, toxicity etc, are hurdles for the practical utility of this technology. Another anisole manufacture process is from phenol and dimethyl ethere with dehydrating catalyst in vapor phase. But this possess suffers from low selectivity and fast deactivation of the catalysts. Conventional methylating agents, such as methyl chloride and dimethyl sulfates are currently less attractive due to environmental concerns [5,6]. Therefore methanol has been emerging as eco-friendly methylating agent [7]. Recently, much attention has been paid on the eco-friendly catalysts to replace the mineral acid catalysts. In the recent past, O-methylation of phenol with methanol in vapor phase has been reported using clays, mixed metal oxides, sulfated metal oxides, zeolites, etc [8–14] as catalysts. Though the methylation of phenol is the subject interest for several authors, no clear cut understanding in the case of acid-base properties of the catalysts. According to some reports, catalysts with strong acidic sites favor O-methylation, weak acidic or strong basic sites favor the C-methylation [11,12,15–17]. Contrarily, catalysts with weak acidic sites favor O-methylation of phenol [18,19]. Of late, methylation of phenol with methanol as methylating agent over metal phosphates catalysts has been investigated and reported that the products are less selective towards O-methylation, i.e., yielding the mixture of O-methylated and C-methylated products [20,21]. In recent times, much attention has been paid on synthesis, characterization and catalytic applications of lanthanum phosphate catalysts based on their acid-base bifunctional characteristics and vital catalytic properties. In the present study, aiming at understanding the relation between acid-base characteristics and product selectivity in methylation of phenol, lanthanum phosphate catalysts by different methods keeping lanthanum to phosphate ratio constant at 1 (La/P=1) three catalysts were prepared by (i) simple co-precipitation method (LaP-1), (ii) co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal treatments (LaP-2) and (iii) co-precipitation by pH variation method (6LaP-3). In the catalytic activity point of view, the catalyst prepared by pH variation method exhibited superior activity. Hence, three more lanthanum phosphate catalysts apart from 6LaP-3 were prepared by pH variation method at pH=2, 9, and 12 and denoted as 2LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3 catalysts. Herein, the details of lanthanum phosphate catalyst preparation (pH variation), characterization and catalytic activity for the selective O-methylation of phenol emphasizing the acid-base properties have been delineated for the first time. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Lanthanum phosphate catalysts at constant lanthanum to phosphate ratio (La/P=1) were prepared by different methods such as (i) simple co-precipitation, (ii) co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal and (iii) co-precipitation by pH variation. 2.1.1 Simple co-precipitation method Lanthanum phosphate catalyst (La/P=1) was prepared according to reported method [22] and denoted as LaP-1 catalyst. Typically, 6.234g of La (NO3)3·6H2O dissolved in 480mL of distilled water and added 1.41g of H3PO4 drop wise. The pH of formed white gel was adjusted to 8 with 25% ammonia solution under continuous stirring for 24h at RT. The precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with distilled water, dried at 100°C for 24h and calcined at 400°C for 4h in static air. 2.1.2 Co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal treatment According to reported procedure lanthanum phosphate [23] catalyst was prepared and designated as LaP-2. Typically, 25mL of 0.8M aqueous solution of La (NO3)3·6H2O and the same concentration of Na3PO4 were prepared separately and added at once under vigorous stirring for 30min pH was adjusted <1 with 0.1M HCl under stirring. Subsequently, Pluronic P123 polymer was added to the suspension under stirring at 40°C, and continued the stirring for 2h, transferred to autoclave, hydrothermally treated at 100°C. Precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water. The resulting solid sample was calcined at 550°C for 6h to remove the P123 polymer. 2.1.3 Co-precipitation by pH variation method Lanthanum phosphate catalyst was prepared in accordance with the reported literature report [24] and coded as LaP-3. In a typical procedure, 0.03M aqueous solution of La (NO3)3·6H2O solution was prepared. While stirring at RT H3PO4 (1.41g) (La/P=1) was added drop wise to the lanthanum nitrate solution. A white gel like precipitate of lanthanum phosphate was formed, which was completely flocculated with 25% ammonium solution at a pH of 6, then filtered and washed with distilled water. Filtered precipitate was peptized under stirring for 4h at RT by adding 20% (v/v) HNO3 to maintain the pH range in between 1.8–2. Then centrifuged the peptized milky white solution and washed with distilled water. The washed sample dried at 80°C for 12h, calcined at 400°C for 4h (ramping rate 10°C/min) in static air. The calcined sample was coded as 6LaP-3, wherein 6 represents the flocculated pH value and 3 refers to adopted preparation method. Following the similar procedure 2LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3 catalysts were synthesized. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The lanthanum phosphate samples were analyzed by elemental analysis (ICP-OES M/s. Thermo Scientific iCAP6500 DU) by dissolving in aquaregia along with few drops of hydrofluoric acid. XRD patterns were recorded on an Ultima-IV (M/s. Rigaku Corporation, Japan) XRD unit operated at 40kV and 40mA with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation. The BET surface area was determined by N2 physisorption (M/s. Quantachrome Instruments, USA). Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD – NH3) was measured by AUTOSORB-iQ, automated gas sorption analyzer (M/s. Quantachrome Instruments, USA). Prior to desorption, the catalyst samples have been saturated with the ammonia (10% NH3 balance helium) at 80°C for 30min, followed by removal of the physisorbed NH3 through the stripping with helium at the same temperature for 30min. Later on, the temperature was raised to 800°C at the rate of 10°C/min, with simultaneous monitoring of the desorbed NH3 with the inbuilt TCD in a flow of helium (60mL/min). The TPD of CO2 was conducted similar to that of TPD of NH3, with just replacing NH3 by CO2 (10% CO2 balance helium). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a spectrum GX spectrometer (M/s. Perkin-Elmer, Germany) in the scan range of 4000–400cm−1 with the 4cm−1 spectral resolution using KBr disc method. 2.3 Activity test Activity tests were conducted in a fixed-bed down flow quartz glass reactor (14mm id and 300mm long). 1.0g of the catalyst and equal amount of the quartz particles were mixed and loaded at the centre of the reactor and flushed at 400°C for 1h in N2 flow of 30mL/min. Silicon beads were used as preheating zone. With 3mL/h feed (phenol: methanol=1: 9, v/v) using a syringe pump (M/s. B. Braun, Germany) run the reaction. The product mixture was collected in an ice cooled trap at regular intervals and analyzed by a FID equipped GC (GC-17A, M/s. Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with Suplecowax capillary column (30m×0.53mm×5.0μm) and products were confirmed by GC–MS, QP-5050 (M/s. Shimadzu Instruments, Japan) with DB–5 capillary column (30m×0.25mm×0.25μm). The reactor diameter is 14mm and bed length is around 0.5mm. Hence, either diffusion limitations or mass transfer limitations may not be substantial influence. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts According to ICP-OES analysis lanthanum to phosphate ratio is around 0.98–0.99, which is close to amount of precursors used. The BET surface areas of LaP-3 catalysts are presented in Table 1 , which are found to be in the range between 71–97m2/g. The LaP-3 catalysts prepared at lower pH possess higher surface area (>90m2/g), total acidity (from TPD of NH3) and total basicity (from TPD of CO2) can be seen from Table 1. Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of LaP-3 catalysts synthesized at different pH values. These patterns imply the presence of both rhabdophane (JCPDS file No. 46-1439) and hexagonal phases (JCPDS file No.04-0635). The rhabdophane phase of LaP-3 catalysts appears at 2θ=31.2° (100%), 29.03° (78%) and hexagonal phase appears at 2θ=29.30° (100%), 41.58° (90%). In the XRD patterns of 2LaP-3 and 6LaP-3 the peak intensities corresponding to rhabdophane and hexagonal phase are almost equal, whereas in the patterns of 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3 the peak intensity of rhabdophane diminished, revealing the predominant crystalline phase is hexagonal when the LaP-3 catalysts prepared at higher pH. The XRD reflection appears at 2θ=31.2° is predominantly rhabdophane phase, which gradually decreased with increase in pH during the catalyst preparation step. Crystallite size of the LaP-3 catalyst series are depicted in Table 1 which are almost equal in size. The NH3-TPD profiles of LaP-3 catalysts were shown in Fig. 2 (a) and the respective total acidity values are summarized in Table-1. The acid site distribution mainly classified based on the desorption temperature of NH3, desorption at >400°C (strong acidic sites), at 250–400°C (medium acidic sites) and at <250°C (weak acidic sites) [25]. Weak acidic sites are predominant in almost all LaP catalysts. Close observation demonstrates that along with weak acidic sites moderate acidic are present in 2LaP-3 and 6LaP catalysts and strong acidic sites are present in 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3 catalysts. The TPD profile of all the LaP-3 catalysts possess basic sites such as weak, moderate, and strong, among these, moderate basic sites are predominant (Fig. 2(b)). 2LaP-3 catalyst is having the more number of moderate basic sites, whereas, strong and weak basic sites are less in number. In 6LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP catalysts more number of weak and less number of moderate basic sites are present. These observations indicate that as the preparation pH rises from 6 to 12, weak basic sites are more in number and moderate basic sites number is less. FTIR spectra of LaP-3 catalysts synthesized at different pH were shown in Fig. 3 . The broad band at 3500–3700cm−1 is due to the OH stretching vibration and its bending vibration is at 1645cm−1. P-O stretching vibration, O=P-O and O-P-O bending modes of phosphate appeared at 1046, 615 and 538cm−1 respectively [26,27]. A small intense band in the region of 1385cm−1 is originated from trapped nitrate absorption [24]. 4 Performance of the catalyst 4.1 Activity comparison among lanthanum phosphate catalysts prepared by different methods The catalytic activity of lanthanum phosphate catalysts (La/P=1) prepared by three different methods is displayed in Table 2 . All the three catalysts, i.e., LaP-1, LaP-2 and 6LaP-3 are active in the alkylation of phenol. As shown in Scheme 1 , in the O-alkylation path anisole, p-methyl anisole and o-methyl anisole are formed, wherein the major product is anisole. The detailed product distribution is shown in Table 2. As shown in Scheme 2 , C-alkylated products like o-cresol, p-cresol, 2, 4-dimethyl phenol, 2, 6-dimethyl phenol and 2, 4, 6-trimethyl phenol are formed. The formation of these products by O-alkylation and C-alkylation is common in accordance with open literature. The product distribution shown in Table 2, reflecting anisole is the major product over all the three LaP-1, LaP-2 and 6LaP-3 catalysts, suggesting that the LaP catalysts are selective towards anisole formation irrespective of method of preparation. However, there is a discrepancy in the case of LaP-1 and LaP-2 catalysts. LaP-1 catalyst exhibited higher conversion (35.3%) and lower selectivity (42%), contrarily LaP-2 catalyst exhibited lower conversion (25%) and higher selectivity (61.9%). In the catalytic activity point of view, both LaP-1 and LaP-2 catalysts exhibited more or less same activity (in the case anisole yield). 6LaP-3 catalyst, prepared by pH variation method exhibited superior activity (69.1% conversion and 45% selectivity) compared to LaP-1 and LaP-2 catalysts. Unambiguously, there is a clear demarcation in the activity of lanthanum phosphate catalysts prepared in three different methods at constant composition of lanthanum and phosphate. 4.2 Activity comparison of lanthanum phosphate catalysts prepared by pH variation method After realizing the pH variation method is more appropriate for the alkylation of phenol with methanol, using the similar procedure 2LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12 LaP-3 catalysts were prepared and conducted the alkylation of phenol in the vapor phase and the results are displayed in Fig. 4 (a). The catalytic activity data displayed in Fig. 5, is clearly showing the influence of pH variation during the catalyst preparation. 2LaP-3 catalyst exhibited good activity with approximately, 58% conversion of phenol and 60% selectivity of anisole. In spite of substantial advancement in anisole formation, the formation of methyl anisoles, cresols, di- and tri-methyl phenols has not been completely impeded. In the conversion point of view 6LaP-3 catalyst is better compared to 2LaP-3 catalyst. Contrarily, in the case of selectivity 2LaP-3 is the better catalyst compared to 6LaP-3 catalyst. With rise in pH of the catalyst preparation (pH=2 to 6) increase in conversion is observed, which may be due to increment in the formation of cresols. The gradual decrease in both conversion and selectivity with rise in pH=6 to 9 and 12 is observed. i.e., from 9LaP-3 to 12LaP-3. Among all the pH variation catalysts, 2LaP-3 is the best catalyst in the yield of anisole point of view. Hence, using 2LaP-3 as a catalyst the influence of reaction temperature was tested and the results are shown in Fig. 4 (b), which shows that with increase in reaction temperature, gradual increase of phenol conversion and simultaneous decrease of anisole selectivity is observed. The fall in anisole selectivity is due to simultaneous production of cresols. The formation of C-alkylated products at higher reaction temperatures compared to anisole was reported by several authors [28,29]. Time-on-stream study of 2LaP-3 catalyst was made and activity results are shown in Fig. 4 (c), accordingly, marginal decrease in conversion and selectivity of anisole, whereas the selectivity of cresols gradually increased. The slow activity decay may be due to formation of coke. To understand superior activity of 2LaP-3 catalyst compared to other catalysts like 6LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3, it is necessary to compare both physico-chemical characteristics as well as structural and textural features of all the catalysts of this series. The catalysts prepared at lower pH show higher surface areas (Table 1), i.e., 2LaP-3 and 6LaP-3. It seems that the catalysts having higher surface exhibit higher catalytic activity in the alkylation of phenol to anisole. Catalyst having high surface area possessing high catalytic activity is the common phenomena. The XRD reflection appears at 2θ=31.2° represents rhabdophane phase of LaP-3 catalysts, which gradually decreased with increase in pH during the catalyst preparation steps, i.e., in 2LaP-3 catalyst, rhabdophane phase composition is more compared to other catalysts of this series. It appears that the higher activity of 2LaP-3 catalyst may be due to rhabdophane rich crystalline phase. The close observation of NH3- TPD patterns of LaP-3 catalysts shown in Fig. 2, revealing that the weak and moderate acidic sites are more in 2LaP-3 catalyst compared to other catalysts of this series. Despite the alkylation of phenol is an important reaction, no tangible information is available regarding the acidic properties of the catalysts, particularly strength and density of acidic sites, which varied from catalyst to catalyst. However, the selectivity of alkylated products mostly depends on the mode of adsorption. According to literature reports the adsorption of phenol on the surface of the catalyst is either parallel or perpendicular. If the adsorption orientation of phenol molecule on catalyst surface is parallel the probability for O-alkylation and C-alkylation is equal (Scheme 3 , major path), whereas the adsorption orientation of phenol is perpendicular on the acidic sites of lanthanum phosphate as phenolate ion, the products are mostly C-alkylated (Scheme 3, minor path). As shown in Table 3 , the superior catalyst is 2LaP-3, on the surface of this catalyst weak and moderate acidic sites are mostly populated, which interact with aromatic ring. This interaction makes the phenol molecule susceptible to orient parallel to the surface of the catalyst. Hence, phenolic oxygen will have high access along with ring carbons at o- and p- positions. Consequently, the selective products are anisole and cresols (Table 3). On the whole, the weak and moderate acidic sites of 2LaP-3 catalyst seem to be responsible for its higher catalytic activity. The TPD patterns of CO2 shown in Fig. 3 demonstrating that the strength and distribution of basic sites in all four LaP-3 catalysts are almost same. Hence, it is difficult to assign what kind of basic sites are responsible for high activity and selectivity. However, it is important to note that the role of basic sites in the methylation of phenol is compulsory. 5 Conclusions In summary, lanthanum phosphate catalysts prepared by pH variation method are good catalysts for the O-alkylation of phenol to anisole. 2LaP-3 catalyst prepared at lower pH exhibited higher activity. The reason may be due to rhabdophane rich crystalline phase, high surface area and establishment of a striking balance between acidic and basic sites. References [1] K. Weissermel H.J.

Lanthanum and phosphate concentration in all the catalysts is constant (La/P=1) irrespective of method of preparation. All the 3 catalysts (LaP-1, LaP-2 and 6LaP-3) prepared by different methods are used as catalysts for the O-methylation of phenol and found that the catalyst prepared by pH variation method (6LaP-3) exhibited better activity. A series of catalysts with La/P=1 by pH variation method (2LaP-3, 6LaP-3, 9LaP-3 and 12LaP-3) have been prepared and characterized by FT-IR, X-ray diffraction and BET surface area to obtain the structural and textural information. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 studies of LaP-3 catalysts revealed the distribution and strength of acidic and basic sites respectively. LaP-3 catalysts are in hexagonal and rhabdophane phases (XRD). The LaP-3 catalysts are highly active and selective towards formation of anisole via methylation of phenol with methanol in the vapor phase. 2LaP-3 is the best catalyst among the LaP-3 catalyst series in the catalytic activity point of view. Weak and moderate acidic sites along with basic sites might have contributed for the high conversion of phenol and good selectivity of anisole.",
