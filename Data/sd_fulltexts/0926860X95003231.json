This high 4,4'-DEBp selectivity and yield are not attributed to the shape selectivity of H-Y zeolite, but to an effective modification of the transethylation conditions.

Introduction 4,4'-Dialkylbiphenyl is a promising raw material for the preparation of 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (4,4'-BDCA), which is a monomer for various high-performance polymers. It has been well established that the isopropylation of biphenyl occurs preferentially at the 4,4'-position over shape-selective mor- denite catalyst [1,2]. On the other hand, the corresponding selectivity has not yet been achieved for the ethylation of biphenyl with ethylene over mordenite catalyst. Lack of the selectivity lies in the size of the ethyl group introduced, because the mordenite may not exert its shape selectivity on groups less bulky than the isopropyl group. However, 4,4'-diethylbiphenyl (4,4'-DEBp) seems to be a more desirable * Corresponding author. Tel. (+ 81-93) 8841628, fax. (+ 81-93) 8841923 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

We report here on the selective ethylation of biphenyl to produce 4,4'-DEBp, without using mordenite catalyst. 2. Experimental Biphenyl, polyethylbenzenes (Nippon Steel Chemical Co.), and three types of catalysts, a commercially available mordenite (Toso Co.), Y zeolite (Toso Co.), silica-alumina (Nikki Chemical Co.), were used. These catalysts, all H-types, were calcined at 300 for 18 h before use. All the experiments were carried out in a batchwise operation using a 300-ml autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Products were analyzed by FID gas chromatography. 3. Results and discussion The results of the ethylation of biphenyl with ethylene in the presence of the three types of catalysts at 280-300 are summarized in Table 1. A high biphenyl conversion over H-Y zeolite and mordenite is difficult to realize for this reaction, because these catalysts, which are strongly acidic, were readily deactivated with ethylene even in a batchwise operation. Strong acid sites on the catalysts promoted the formation of carbonaceous deposit with ethylene. On the other hand, silica-alumina catalyst, which has moderate acid strength for this reaction, was able to give a high conversion. The ortho position of biphenyl would be first ethylated because of strong ortho orientation in the alkylation of biphenyl with olefins [3]. In fact, a large amount of the o-substituted isomers were formed for all of the catalyst systems, Table 1 Ethylation of Bp with ethylene Catalyst a Reaction Bp conv. 4,4'-DEBp DEBp isomer ratio (%) temp., time (mol-%) yield 4,4'- 3,4'- 3,3'- 3,5- Other (, min) (mol-%) DEBp DEBp DEBp DEBp DEBp b Si-AI 280, 20 78.5 0.72 3.0 12.0 10.2 21.2 53.6 H-Y 300, 10 10.2 0.01 5.6 9.1 5.5 2.5 77.3 Morde. 280, 20 14.3 0.11 9.4 25.9 15.3 2.9 46.5 Compn. at thermodn, equil.

In addition, a significant amount of the m-substituted isomers were also formed. These observations show that the m-substituted isomers are thermodynamically most stable and the ethylation is accompanied by the isomerization of the o- and p-substituted isomers to the m-substituted ones. This isomerization mechanism was discussed in detail in our previous paper on the isopropylation of biphenyl [3]. As described above, the preferential alkylation of biphenyl at the 4,4'-position over mordenite catalyst was difficult when ethylene was used in place of propene [1,2]. The results of transethylation of biphenyl with diethylbenzene over silica- alumina catalyst at 300-350 are shown in Table 2. With diethylbenzene, the ethylation at the o-positions of biphenyl was markedly suppressed. This might be the result of steric hindrance at the o-positions of biphenyl, because transethylation requires enough room for bulkier diethylbenzene [4]. Another noteworthy result from this table is that the 4,4'-DEBp isomer ratio was more than 30% when the reaction time was short (5 min) and the biphenyl conversion was low (7.2%). This 4,4'-DEBp ratio decreased with a considerable increase in the ratio of the m-products, when the reaction was carried out for a longer time (240 min). These results suggest that 4,4'-DEBp is primarily produced in the early stage of the transethylation and that the rearrangement of the ethyl group to the m-position takes place during the reaction (see Fig. 1). The p-orientation in this reaction can also be explained by the HOMO 7r electron density (0.30 eV) for the p-positions of biphenyl, a significantly higher 3\"2'2 3 (~EL 4'~4 ~ Et~Et 5~6' 6--5 Transethylation Biphenyl 4, 4'-DEBp Isomeri zat ion Fig. 1.

However, both of the para ratio of 30% and the biphenyl conversion of 7.2% (Table 2) were still an unsatisfac- tory result for us. Our final approach was to modify the transethylation conditions over H-Y zeolite catalyst: lowering reaction temperatures (160-170) to minimize the isomerization and using a large amount of poly-ethylbenzenes (triethyl- and tetraethylbenzenes) to accelerate the transethylation (see Fig. 1). H-Y zeolite, which has enough space for the transethylation, were more suitable as a catalyst because it is a stronger acid than silica-alumina. Shape selectivity of H-Y zeolite can hardly be expected, based on its large pore size. As shown in Table 3, the higher isomer ratios and yields of 4,4'-DEBp were attained. For example, the isomer ratio and yield of 4,4'-DEBp reached 86% and 53 mol-%, respec- tively, when the transethylation of biphenyl was carried out with a large amount of tetraethylbenzene (1:3 by weight) at 170 for 6 h. Silica-alumina catalyst, having an irregular pore size, can not be expected to demonstrate shape selectivity, but it was able to give a high 4,4'-DEBp isomer ratio. Biphenyl conversion was very low, however, compared with the results over H-Y zeolite, because silica-alumina catalyst is a weaker acid than H-Y zeolite. Based on these results, we conclude that the high 4,4'-DEBp selectivity and yield over H-Y zeolite are not attributed to the shape selectivity of H-Y zeolite, but to modified conditions of the transethylation. Shown in Table 3, the 4,4'-DEBp isomer ratio reached almost 95%, when using a mixture of biphenyl and 4-ethylbiphenyl (2:1 by weight). This result indicates that the selective transeth- ylation leading to 4,4'-DEBp took place, with contamination of a small amount of 3,4'-DEBp, a byproduct formed by isomerization of 4,4'-DEBp. In the results in Table 3, polyethylbenzenes were consumed selectively and tri-, di-, and mono-ethylbenzene were formed. Side reactions, for example a formation of biphenyl ethane skeleton products, were almost negligible. 4. Conclusion A transethylation of biphenyl with triethyl- or tetraethylbenzene over H-Y zeolite catalyst at comparatively lower temperatures is effective for the selective preparation of 4,4'-DEBp.
