A series of ionic liquid-based zinc tetrahalide complexes were synthesized and their effects in the coupling reactions of ethylene oxide (EO) and carbon dioxide to produce ethylene carbonate (EC) were evaluated. The zinc tetrahalide complexes displayed high catalytic activities for the coupling reaction, but were found to cause a severe decomposition of EC during the vacuum-distillation of the product mixture. Among the various factors affecting the EC decomposition, the concentration of zinc tetrahalide species was most responsible for the decomposition: the lower the concentration, the lesser the decomposition. The addition of an imidazolium or ammonium halide was effective for enhancing the activity of the zinc tetrahalide complex while having only a minor effect on the decomposition rate. The optimum catalyst composition was discussed for producing EC feasibly with minimized product decomposition. Keywords Ionic liquid-based zinc tetrahalide Coupling reaction Ethylene carbonate decomposition Zinc tetrahalide species 1 Introduction Carbon dioxide, which is considered to be a “greenhouse gas”, has received much attention for industrial usage since demand for replacement of chlorinated solvents emerged in the 1980s [1]. Meanwhile, CO2 continues to be utilized as a feedstock for the production of organic products. To date, only a few economically feasible processes have been uncovered that utilize carbon dioxide. One of the most successful processes utilizing CO2 is the synthesis of cyclic carbonate. The demand for cyclic carbonates is continuously increasing in a wide variety of applications that include electrolytes in the secondary batteries, valuable monomers of polycarbonates and polyurethanes, aprotic polar solvents, and reactants for many chemical reactions, owing to their favorable combination of physical and chemical properties [2,3]. Although a number of methods exist for the preparation of five-membered cyclic carbonates, carbon dioxide insertion into the appropriate epoxides is the method employed commercially to synthesize the most common carbonates: ethylene, propylene, and butylene carbonates. The typical reaction scheme is presented as follows: Much effort has been dedicated to developing suitable catalysts and catalytic systems that can present the reaction with more feasible reaction conditions, faster reaction rates, and higher yields of cyclic carbonates. Alkali metal halides, transition metal halides and onium salts are widely known as being highly productive and selective in the coupling reaction of CO2 to ethylene oxide [4]. The combinations of alkali metal halides or transition metals with tert-alkylammonium halides are very active in promoting coupling reactions; the halide ligands act as nucleophiles [5]. Mg–Al mixed oxides and MgO with strong basic sites on their surface have been shown to effectively catalyze this coupling reaction [6,7]. Zinc(II) complexes have also been used as catalysts because they display high activity in the cyclization and copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides [8,9]. Recently, we have reported that imidazolium zinc tetrahalide complexes, prepared from the reactions of zinc halides with imidazolium halides, display surprisingly high activities in the coupling reactions of CO2 with ethylene oxide to produce ethylene carbonate [4]. A major obstacle in the commercial use of these homogeneous catalytic systems is that they tend to decompose EC during the distillation process. Surprisingly, only a few reports have mentioned this phenomenon, and without providing detailed discussions [10], while some other reports describe studies of only the thermodynamic properties of the ethylene carbonate formed [11,12]. In this paper, we describe the activities of our catalysts and discuss the factors that affect the decomposition of EC when these ionic liquid-based zinc tetrahalides remain in the product mixture. Furthermore, we also suggest the most suitable catalytic system for the feasible preparation and purification of ethylene carbonate. 2 Experimental General considerations: All manipulations were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were freshly distilled before use according to literature procedures. EO was purchased from Honam Petrochemical Co. and was used as received. CO2 was purchased from Sin Yang Gas. Other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and were used without further purification, unless stated otherwise. 1-R-3-methylimidazolium halides were prepared according to a literature procedure [13]. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 300 spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard. 2.1 Synthesis of catalysts Synthesis of (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium)2ZnBr2Cl2. A solution of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (2.69g, 15.3mmol) in CH2Cl2 (25mL) was mixed with a solution of ZnBr2 (1.73g, 7.68mmol) in THF (25mL) and this combination was heated under reflux for 10h. After cooling to room temperature, the white precipitate was collected by filtration. Yield: 89.7%; elemental analysis, calcd. (%) for C12H22Br2Cl2N4Zn: C 27.80, H 4.28, Br 30.83, Cl 13.68, N 10.81, Zn 12.61; found: C 27.55, H 4.31, Br 30.95, Cl 13.53, N 10.75, Zn 12.58; 1H NMR (600MHz, DMSO-d 6, 25°C): δ =1.41 (t, 3H, CH2CH3), 3.82 (s, 3H, CH3), 4.18 (q, 2H, CH2CH3), 7.64 (s, 1H, C3H3N2), 7.79 (s, 1H, C3H3N2), 9.15 (s, 1H, C3H3N2). Other catalysts were prepared in an analogous manner. 2.2 Coupling reaction of EO and CO2 All of the coupling reactions were conducted in a 200mL stainless steel bomb reactor equipped with a magnetic bar and an electric heater. The reactor was charged with desired amounts of catalyst, EO, and EC as the solvent. The bomb was pressurized with CO2 (ca. 1.4MPa) and then heated to a specified reaction temperature, then CO2 was added from a reservoir tank to maintain constant pressure. After the completion of the reaction, the bomb was cooled to room temperature and the remaining epoxide was removed by means of an aspirator. The product mixture was analyzed using a GC–MS (HP 6890-5973 MSD) and a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 6890), equipped with a flame-ionization detector and an FFAP capillary column (30 m×0.32mm×0.25μm). 2.3 Decomposition tests All of the decomposition tests were performed in a 100mL stainless steel bomb reactor equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic bar, an electric heater, a thermocouple, and a steel condenser. The steel condenser on the lid of the reactor was attached to a digital pressure gauge, which was connected directly to a high-vacuum pump. The bomb was charged with an appropriate catalyst and EC as the solvent and heated to a specified temperature. At the desired temperature, the reactor was evacuated to reduce the pressure to 0.2mmHg by means of the vacuum pump. The degree of EC decomposition was monitored by the pressure increase during 5min at the same temperature. 3 Results and discussion We prepared a series of ionic liquid-based zinc tetrahalide complexes, A2ZnX2Y2, by reacting ZnX2 (X=Cl, Br) with an ionic liquid, AY (A=imidazolium, ammonium; Y=Cl, Br) at ambient or reflux temperatures, depending on the nature of the halide groups. The catalytic activities of zinc tetrahalide complexes were evaluated in the coupling reactions of CO2 with EO to produce EC. The reaction proceeded at 140°C for 1h; the molar ratio of EO to catalyst was set to 5000. As Table 1 indicates, the individual activities of the zinc bromide or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide alone were extremely low (entries 1 and 2), but the combination of zinc bromide with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide exhibited a high activity for the coupling reaction (entry 3), which suggests that the presence of the imidazolium cation plays an important role in the catalysis. All of the zinc tetrahalide complexes were very active in the coupling reactions and gave nearly 100% product selectivity (entries 4–7). A combination of 1-methylimidazole, 2-chloroethanol, and ZnBr2 also displayed high activity; this finding implies that an ionic liquid species, 1-ethoxy-3-methylimidazolium chloride, was formed in situ during the reaction. Even though the ionic liquid-based catalysts were active enough for the pilot-scale operation, a problem was encountered during the recovery of EC (b.p. 243–248°C/760mmHg) from the catalyst-containing product mixture by a vacuum distillation. When the distillation of the product mixture containing 0.2wt.% of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Emim]Br) was carried out using a thin film evaporator at 130°C under a reduced pressure of 30mmHg, we found that a significant amount of EC decomposed to ethylene oxide and CO2. This result implies that the ionic liquid-based catalyst is also an effective catalyst for the EC decomposition in the absence of CO2 pressure. A series of lab-scale decomposition tests were conducted under the reduced pressure of 0.2mmHg to study the decomposition phenomenon and to develop a better catalytic system, which can minimize the EC decomposition. Fig. 1 shows the trend of EC decomposition with the temperature rise. As Fig. 1 indicates, we observed no decomposition of EC when it existed alone, even when the temperature rose to 150°C. Similarly, the presence of either the zinc bromide or [Emim]Br alone did not promote the decomposition of EC. In contrast, the combination of zinc bromide and [Emim]Br resulted in a serious EC decomposition. These phenomena suggest a synergistic role for the zinc halide and [Emim]Br in both the coupling reaction and the decomposition. Fig. 2 indicates clearly that a moderate to severe degree of decomposition of EC took place in the presence of zinc tetrahalide complexes. By comparison, a catalyst from a different class of compounds to the series discussed here – the piperidine-bound zinc halide complex, [1-methylpiperidine]2ZnBr2 – also displayed a similar propensity to promote EC decomposition. The catalyst [Emim]2ZnBr2Cl2 exhibited the greatest effect on the decomposition, followed by [1-methylpiperidine]2ZnBr2. The other two of catalysts, containing OH functional groups, gave relatively flat curves, which suggest that the hydroxyl group has some effect on reducing the decomposition rate. Fig. 3 and Table 2 summarize the effect of catalyst concentration on the EC decomposition and EC yield, respectively. The experiments conducted with [Emim]2ZnBr2Cl2 and [Bu4N]2ZnBr2Cl2 clearly indicate that both the rate of EC decomposition and the EC yield increase with increasing catalyst concentration. With a hope of finding a better catalytic system to minimize the EC decomposition, while enhancing the catalytic activity of zinc tetrahalide complexes, we have investigated the effect of added [Emim]Br. As shown in Table 3 , the yield of EC increased with increasing molar ratio of [Emim]Br/[Emim]2ZnBr2Cl2. On the other hand, the rate of EC decomposition is nearly independent of the concentrations of added [Emim]Br in the reaction mixture (Fig. 4 ). The results in Table 2 (entry 3) and Table 3 (entry 5), and Fig. 4 demonstrate that the activity of 0.025wt.% imidazolium zinc tetrahalide can be increased up to more than six times by adding 8molar equivalents of [Emim]Br, without increasing the rate of EC decomposition to a noticeable degree. We have also examined the effect of tetrabutylammonium bromide ([Bu4N]Br) added to [Bu4N]2ZnBr2Cl2 on the coupling reactions (Table 3). These results again indicate that the addition of [Emim]Br and [Bu4N]Br to the corresponding zinc tetrahalide complex enhances the catalytic activity to an enormous extent. Such an activity increase is likely to be due to the in situ formation of a new active species from the interaction of added [Bu4N]Br or [Emim]Br with the corresponding zinc tetrahalide complex; the potential for their formation seems to increase upon increasing the amount of additional [Bu4N]Br or [Emim]Br. Because the mechanism of decomposition was not understood very well, we focused our investigation mainly on the effects of the catalyst concentration and catalyst compositions. According to our experience based on the distillation conditions, a notable degree of decomposition occurred when the remaining catalyst concentration was greater than 0.1% by weight ratio to EC. From our findings, we proposed that the optimum reaction conditions exist for a catalytic system consisting of an imidazolium or ammonium zinc tetrahalide complex and an additional corresponding imidazolium or ammonium halide. The combination must provide a good degree of productivity of ethylene carbonate and a low degree of decomposition of the product in a pilot-scale operation. For this purpose, the initial loading of zinc tetrahalide catalyst should be far below 0.1% by weight, because the catalyst becomes concentrated during the distillation process, whereas the amount of added imidazolium or ammonium halide should be maintained high enough to obtain a good degree of productivity. Initially, we suspected that the Lewis acidic character of the zinc tetrahalide complexes is responsible for the EC decomposition; hence, we also performed a decomposition test in the presence of a zinc tetrahalide catalyst and a strongly basic compound, such as diethylamine. We expected that the addition of a Lewis base would neutralize the Lewis acidity of zinc tetrahalide complex, thereby reducing the decomposition activity. Surprisingly, we observed that decomposition still occurred, even upon the addition of a strongly Lewis basic agent, suggesting that the Lewis acidity of the catalyst is not a major factor for the EC decomposition. From the experimental results, we conclude that the species most responsible for the decomposition is the zinc tetrahalide, not the zinc halide, imidazolium halide or ammonium halide. Therefore, to obtain a high productivity with minimized EC decomposition, it is desirable to use a lower amount of zinc tetrahalide catalyst if possible, while maintaining a higher molar ratio of added imidazolium or ammonium halide to the catalyst. 4 Conclusions A series of ionic liquid-based zinc tetrahalide complexes, prepared from zinc halides and ionic liquids such as imidazolium halides and ammonium halides, were tested for their activities in the cycloaddition of CO2 to ethylene oxide to produce ethylene carbonate. The high catalytic activities of these complexes are represented by the high yields obtained and from the values of the TOFs. Similar catalytic activities were obtained from the catalytic systems consisting of zinc halides and ionic liquids. A significant EC decomposition was observed during the distillation of the product mixture containing zinc tetrahalide species under a reduced pressure. It was also found that the co-presence of an ionic liquid and a zinc halide promotes the EC decomposition. In contrast, the EC decomposition was not observed when zinc halides or ionic liquids were present alone in the reaction mixture, implying a synergic role between the zinc halide and the ionic liquid. The addition of ionic liquid to the corresponding zinc tetrahalide complex enhances the coupling reaction while having only a minor effect on the decomposition rate. It is likely that the zinc tetrahalide species, (ZnX2Y2 2−) is the one most responsible for the EC decomposition. Whether the decomposition is moderate or severe largely depends on the concentration of zinc tetrahalide species left in the product mixture, not on the individual concentration of zinc halide or ionic liquid. Therefore, to obtain a high productivity with minimized EC decomposition, it is desirable to maintain a lower concentration of zinc tetrahalide and a higher concentration of added imidazolium or ammonium halide in the reaction mixture.
