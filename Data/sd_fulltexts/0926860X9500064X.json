The VGO-aged catalysts displayed one CO2 peak from oxidation of coke and two SO2 peaks from oxidation of inorganic sulfur on the catalyst. The temperature at which the CO2 peak appeared increased with the coke content. For the Kuwait-aged catalysts, a second, high-temperature carbon oxidation peak was observed when moderate amounts of vanadium were present. The carbon oxidation peaks were closely accompanied by SO2 peaks. The coke in the latter catalysts essentially covered the inorganic sulfur phase as well as adsorbed nitrogen compounds. It was found that the aged catalysts could lose a considerable amount of sulfur during the extraction procedure if too high a temperature was used during post-drying.

Introduction When upgrading petroleum feedstocks with hydroprocessing catalysts, carbon is deposited on the surface of the catalyst. The main reason why hydrotreating catalysts used in the upgrading of light petroleum distillates deactivate is carbon deposition. Carbon deposits are formed mainly from polynuclear aromatics in the feedstock accumulated during the first few hours of operation [ 1 ]. Catalysts used in the upgrading of residual oils either deactivate due to accumulation of Ni and V sulfide deposits on the catalyst surface [2,3] or due to both carbon and metal accumulation [4]. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Barthola~v et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 33-42 Catalyst coking is a significant source of catalyst deactivation, and it is thus important to fully understand this process. In order to do so, carbon deposits on spent hydroprocessing catalysts can be examined by various characterization tech- niques. Among these, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), has been shown to be a useful tool in the characterization of carbon deposits on spent hydropro- cessing catalysts [5,6]. In the present study, the TPO technique was used to char- acterize carbon deposits on spent hydroprocessing catalysts deactivated on both heavy distillates and residual oils. 2. Experimental The fresh catalyst used in the ageing runs contained 2.8% Ni, 10.1% Mo and 2.2% P and had a surface area of 170 mZ/g. Aged catalysts were obtained from bench-scale runs with Arabian Heavy vacuum gas oil (VGO) or Kuwait Atmos- pheric Resid (Kuwait AR). The conditions of these runs are given in Table 1. A coked catalyst (PY) was prepared by passing a mixture of pyrene and CS2 in heptane over the sulfided catalyst in a laboratory fixed-bed reactor under vapor phase conditions at 350.A11 catalysts were subsequently Soxhlet extracted with xylene, followed by heating to either 180 or 100 in a nitrogen atmosphere overnight. Catalysts were analyzed for carbon and sulfur by conventional oxidation methods. Nickel was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy at 232 nm in an acetylene/air flame. Vanadium was determined by colorimetry as the tungsten- vanadophosphoric acid complex at 400 nm. Properties of the aged catalysts are given in Table 2. All catalysts were directly subjected to temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), or in certain cases to temperature-programmed sulfiding (TPS) prior to TPO. Temperature-programmed oxidation was carried out in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure with 0.1-0.3 g samples. A heating rate of 10/min was used with a gas mixture consisting of 20% 02 in Ar at a flow-rate of 100 cm3/min. The effluent stream was monitored for various gaseous species by a mass spectrometer with the capillary inlet to the mass spectrometer located downstream to the catalyst Table 1 Process conditions Sample Feed Test duration (b) T~l.x () Reactor pressure (bar) PY Pyrene 24 390 - VG-33 VGO Arabian Heavy 24 350 50 VG-35 190 400 150 VG-36 500 400 50 KW-6 Kuwait Arm.

Bartholdy et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 33-42 The first, low-temperature SO2 peak for the fresh, sulfided catalyst (Fig. la) has previously been attributed to oxidation of the active NiMoS phase, whereas the second, high-temperature peak arises from oxidation of a separate NiS phase [ 7 ]. The coked catalyst evolved significantly less SO2 (Fig. lb), especially in the low- temperature region, suggesting that this catalyst contained less sulfur. It is also noted that the CO2 peak and the second SO2 peak occur at the same temperature. Upon subjecting this catalyst to presulfidation (TPS) prior to TPO, the SO2 area increased considerably (Fig. lc), verifying that the original, coked catalyst had a low sulfur content. Furthermore, the presulfiding resulted in the reappearance of the low-temperature SO2 profile, which closely matches that of the standard sulfided catalyst, as can be seen by comparing the SO2 profiles in Fig. 1 c and I a, respectively. The TPO profiles of CO2 and SO2 for several catalysts aged during processing with the vacuum gas oil feed are shown in Fig. 2. The data from the VGO-aged catalysts have been obtained from a previous publication [ 8 ]. In the present context, we refer to the data in [8] using the following nomenclature: run 233 is referred to as VG-33, run 235 is VG-35 and run 236 is VG-36. The CO2 peaks for the first two catalysts (VG-33 and VG-35), which were treated for relatively short time periods, are about the same, with a peak maximum temperature at about 400. There is also some indication of a coke species at a lower oxidation temperature, especially for catalyst VG-35. Catalyst VG-36, which was subjected to VGO for a longer period and had a higher coke content, showed a slightly higher CO2 peak maximum temperature and less evidence of low-temperature coke species. The low-temperature SO2 peaks are well defined and occur at slightly higher tempera- ; //Ij I I C ~ L 7 \\ 100 200 300 400 500 600 Temp., C Fig. 2.

The results for the catalysts aged in Kuwait AR are given in Fig. 3. For sample KW-6, which had been exposed to resid for the shortest time and contained little vanadium, the TPO is similar to that found for the VGO-aged catalysts both for SO2 and for CO2 (Fig. 2a). The TPO's of aged catalysts KW-7 and KW-9 are similar to the TPO of KW-6 for temperatures below 600, but at higher temper- atures, an additional high-temperature coke and sulfur oxidation peak begins to appear for catalyst KW-9, and increases significantly for the KW-7 catalyst. Catalyst KW-7 contained the highest level of vanadium, and KW-7 and KW-9 had been exposed to the longest processing time. The appearance of a second high-temperature CO2 peak has been previously reported [ 6 ]. Thus, there appear to be two distinct types of coke present in the aged catalysts which contain vanadium (Table 2). The TPO of a catalyst that had been aged for 8000 h on a VGO in a commercial hydrotreater is shown in Fig. 4.

Bartholdv et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 129 (1995) 33~12 aged catalyst did not contain vanadium, and as can be seen, the TPO of this catalyst resembles that of the other VGO deactivated catalysts in that it contains no high- temperature peak. This indicates that it is not the long processing time, but rather the presence of vanadium that is responsible for the high-temperature CO2 peak. Since a significant fraction of the sulfur for the catalyst with the highest vanadium content did not oxidize until the CO2 was removed, it is believed that the high- temperature SOz peak originates mainly from inorganic sulfur covered by the high- temperature coke, that is, the catalyst NiMoS phase and vanadium and nickel sulfides are essentially covered by the coke. However, the coke itself may also contain some sulfur. Additional studies of this high-temperature coke are reported in ref. [9]. The temperature at which the low-temperature CO2 peak maximum appears increases with increasing coke content. A plot of the current data together with results previously obtained [ 8 ] is shown in Fig. 5. A sharp increase in the maximum peak temperature is seen up to about 7% C, after which it increases only slightly. The temperature of oxidation has been associated with the degree of 'refractivity' of the coke [ 10], most likely reflected in the atomic H/C ratio of the coke. This may be a manifestation of the time of treatment rather than the quantity of coke present, i.e. with time, the coke may undergo consolidation with loss of hydrogen. A TPO study of VGO-coked supports has shown that the maximum CO2 peak temperature is considerably higher when active metals are not present (Co, Ni, Mo, etc.) [ 11 ]. Data from the latter study are included in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the maximum CO2 peak temperature occurs at 490 despite the carbon level, contrary to what was found for the catalysts discussed previously. These findings suggest that the active metal phase on the catalyst could act as a catalyst in the oxidation process of carbon, as has been reported previously [ 10]. Thus, at low coke surface coverage, a high interaction between coke and active metals (coke oxidation cat- alyst) can occur, which might lower the maximum CO2 peak temperature. At higher coke loadings, the ratio of accessible active metals to coke decreases, and the CO2 peak temperature increases and approaches that of the coked supports. For the V- containing KW catalysts, however, no increase in CO2 peak temperature was observed because the V and Ni deposited catalyze the oxidation and thus lower the burn-off temperature of carbon s{)~0qies on the spent catalyst. 480 I ~-z 460 v 440' 420, 400 0 5 10 15 20 %C Fig. 5.

Catalyst post-treatment During the course of this work it was noted that post-treatment of the coked catalysts, i.e. Soxhlet extraction followed by heating in nitrogen to 180, resulted in a significant loss of sulfur. For example, direct TPO of the PY catalyst indicated a low content of sulfur in the first SO2 peak (Fig. 1B) as compared with the TPS/ TPO run on the same catalyst (Fig. 1C). Small, low-temperature SO2 peaks are also evident in the TPO of KW-9 and KW-7 (Fig. 3). In order to determine if the standard heat treatment temperature of 180 might be responsible for the loss in sulfur, the KW catalysts were subjected to a lower treatment of 100. The sulfur analyses for the sample treated in these different ways are given in Table 3. It can be seen that treatment at 100 resulted in substantially more sulfur remaining on the catalysts than at 180, although not quite as much as for the resulfided catalysts. It is concluded that the 180 treatment is too high, resulting in significant loss of sulfur from the aged catalysts.

Barthol&, et al. /Applied Catalvxis A: General 129 (1995) 33-42 lost from the low-temperature region when the sample is dried at 180. Sulfur in this region is normally considered to stem from the active phase that is covered by coke. Table 3 also shows the effect of these treatments on the carbon content of the aged catalysts. On the whole, neither heat treatment appeared to affect the carbon content appreciably. However, the resulfiding did cause some loss of carbon. 3.3. Coke coverage All the aged catalysts showed some evidence of low-temperature SO2 peaks characteristic of the fresh, sulfided catalyst. This low-temperature sulfur peak is not associated with formation of carbon dioxide, indicating that the sulfur species giving this peak are fully accessible. The present study shows that only a fraction of the sulfur associated with the active NiMoS phase can be oxidized at a low temperature due to coverage by coke. The amount of sulfur oxidized at low tem- perature ( < 350) is plotted vs. the carbon content of the spent catalysts in Fig. 7. As the carbon on the catalyst increases, the fraction of low-temperature sulfur decreases, indicating that the active NiMoS phase becomes increasingly covered by coke. At a coke level of 12%, the data suggest that less than 40% of the NiMoS phase is accessible. It is of course not only coke that covers the active phase; deposited V and Ni can also cover the NiMoS phase of the catalyst. However, for the data of Fig. 7, the amount of deposited metal is small, typically more than one order of magnitude lower than the coke level. Besides, the density of coke is 2-3 times lower than that of the metal sulfides, making coke the predominant species (in volume) covering the catalyst surface. In a recent study [12], it was reported that 96% of the surface of a CoMo catalyst was covered with coke generated from a heavy vacuum gas oil. The 96% coverage reported was determined for a catalyst having 25 wt.-% carbon. Our finding to the effect that 60% of the NiMoS is covered at a carbon level of 10-12 wt.-% is in qualitative agreement with these findings. One data point in Fig. 7 is obviously different from the others, since a surprisingly large fraction of the sulfur present was oxidized at a low temperature even though the carbon content of the catalyst was high.

Catalyst nitrogen Nitrogen in the catalyst is detected during TPO by mass 30 for NO (mass 46 for NO2 was never detected). Mass 30 can also stem from C180 [8,9]. However, since the mass 30 profile should follow that of mass 28 for normal CO, any difference in profiles between mass 30 and mass 28 in the TPO can be ascribed to nitric oxide. Fig. 8 demonstrates the presence of nitric oxide in the mass 30 profile for the TPO of aged catalyst KW-6, where both a low-temperature NO peak is observed as well as a high-temperature peak. The low-temperature NO peak has previously been ascribed to strongly adsorbed NHx species and the high-temperature peak to adsorbed N-aromatic compounds on the catalyst surface [7,8]. The delay in the appearance of the high-temperature NO peak suggests that this N is not intimately associated with the coke. 4. Conclusions Coke in aged catalysts with little or no vanadium exhibits a maximum CO2 temperature peak between 400 and 450. An additional, high-temperature maxi- mum CO2 peak around 630 is found as the vanadium content increases, indicating that a second, more 'refractory' type of coke also exists. The coke in these aged catalysts essentially covers the inorganic sulfur phase as well as adsorbed N-com- pounds. References [ 1 ] P. Wiwel, P. Zeuthen and A.C. Jacobsen, Stud. Surf. Sci.

It was found that the aged catalysts could lose a considerable amount of sulfur during the extraction procedure if too high a temperature was used during post-drying.",
