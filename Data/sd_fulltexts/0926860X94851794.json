The best catalyst (Pb/Mg=0.5) gave a C_+ overall selectivity of 69%, a high activity (at W/F=0.03 g s cm-') and a good stability with time-on-stream. A kinetic study showed that the reaction is of the Rideal-Eley type with nitrous oxide reacting in the adsorbed phase. Other supports such as A12-0;, Zr02, TiO, and S'OZ were used and the activities recorded agreed well with the basicity of the catalyst, PbO-S'02 being totally inactive: Mg0 > Zr0> > A1203 > Ti02 > > > S'012- Key words: aerogels; ethane; ethene; lead oxide; magnesia; methane coupling; nitrous oxide 1. Introduction The majority of all the papers describing the catalytic conversion of methane by oxidative coupling deals with oxygen as the oxidant and composite catalysts which are generally twophase compounds at least. This last point is in agreement with a general observation concerning the catalysis of partial oxidation reactions involving hydrocarbons, i.e. the best catalysts are multiphasic ones from the point of view of activity, selectivity and stability with time-on-stream. Since the pioneering works of Keller and Bhasin in 1982 [ I ] and Hinsen and Baerns in 1983 [2] it is admitted that lead containing catalysts are selective towards the dimerizatiion of methane into G+ but not very active in general. Magnesia alone 1 3-5] or more recently magnesia doped with lithium [6,7] have been found very interesting for the coupling reaction in presence of dioxygen.

Pajonk, T Manzalji /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 41-51 with magnesia was also proposed by many authors [8,9] but very few data were released involving nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen [9-11], no matter the nature of the catalysts used. The sol-gel chemistry of the preparation of mixed oxides associated to supercritical drying methods giving aerogel catalysts, seems to be very appropriate in order to produce interesting Pb0-MgO binary oxides [ 12,13] which have already shown good catalytic properties in the acrylonitrile synthesis from propene and nitric oxide [ 14] . As a general rule it was noticed in our experiments that pure PbO was not active and unstable while associated with a support such as A1203, Si02, ZrOZ [ 1,15,16] its catalytic activity and stability were remarkably enhanced. Thus a series of Pb0/MgO aerogels with different Pb/Mg atomic ratios as well as PbO on A1203, Zr02, Ti0= and SIO= were synthesized and tested in the oxidative coupling of methane by nitrous oxide. 2. Experimental 2.1. Reactor and experimental testing conditions A quartz U tube, dynamic, fixed bed, micro reactor was used between 650 and 800 with an amount of 30 mg of catalyst and a flow-rate of 60 cm3 min-' assuring the chemical regime. Three feeds were employed respectively, they are characterized by the ratios of the partial pressures of methane and nitrous oxide expressed in Torr (1 Torr=133.3 Pa) (PCHQ)/(Pts=o)=1.400)/(50), (200)/(50) and (40)/(400). The total pressure was 1 atm ( = 101.3 kPa) and was attained by using helium as a diluent. Analysis of the reaction products was done by on-line gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID) unit equipped with a Porapak Q$ column (3 m length, 1/8 in. diameter) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) unit mounted with two columns: Porapak Q (2 m length, 1/8 in. diameter) plus zeolite 13X (2 m length, 1/4 in. diameter). With this set-up methane, methanol, nitric oxide, ethane, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide and dioxide, ethylene, propane and nitrous oxide were detected and dosed. Water was not dosed, nor was ammonia, traces of which were always detected with the yellow paper test.

Conversions and selectivities were calculated with respect to methane, for all the runs described in this paper. The data collected in Table l indicate that in the presence of the catalysts, the noncatalytic reaction is negligible since - as is shown below - the conversion is a hundred times higher at 720 in the presence of the Pb0-MgO catalysts under the same conditions. 2.2. Preparation of the aerogel catalysts Pure aerogels of alumina, zirconia, titania, silica and magnesia have been extensively described in the literature, their preparations involved the corresponding alkoxides (or acetylacetonates) and :non-aqueous solvents [ 12,13,15 ] . The binary catalysts were prepared by cogelling lead acetate and the support precursor, and drying under supercritical conditions. The catalysts were cogelled from metal-organic precursors dissolved in methanol and hydrolysed in stoichiometric amounts of water. Aluminium sec-butylate, magnesium acetate, zirconium propylate and titanium orthotetrabutyl compounds were selected to play the role of support while lead acetate was chosen for all catalysts. The wet gels were all dried under supercritical conditions with respect to methanol i.e. at 255 (T, = 242) . Unsupported lead oxide xerogel was prepared from the nitrate and the Pb02 Zr02 xerogel was synthesized from the precipitation by NH40H of the corresponding solution of zirconium acetylacetonate and lead nitrate at 60, followed by drying in air at 150 for 12 h. A thorough description of the method of preparation can be found in refs. [ 13 ] and [ 15] . A series of four Pb0-MgO aerogels was synthesized with the following atomic ratios (Pb) / (Mg) =0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1, the (Pb)/(Mg) =0.5 is called the standard catalyst. A series of four other binary aerogel catalysts was made with a constant atomic ratio (Pb) / (M) = 0.5 where M stands for Al, Ti, Zr and Si. The BET surface areas of the catalysts calcined in a flow of air at 400 for 24 h, are given in Table 2 for all PbO based catalysts characterized by a ratio (Pb) /(M) =0.5 (M: Al, Zr. Ti, Mg) as well as for pure PbO. Table 2 BET surface areas of the lead oxide based aerogel catalysts Catalysts S (m-/g) Remarks Pb0-Si0= 600 Amorphous P60-AI_O3 208 Pb,04 and P60,.

Pajonk. T. Manzalji /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 41-51 As already observed and described elsewhere, aerogels exhibit much higher BET areas than the corresponding xerogels, as is shown here for the two Pb0-ZrO, samples [ 13 ] . 3. Results and discussion Before any catalytic test the solids (30 mg) were activated at 600 in dry oxygen for 18 h and then swept with helium and heated to the reaction temperature of 720. The flowrate was fixed at 1 cm' s-' so that W/F equals 0.03 g s cm-3. First, MgO alone was studied and Fig. 1 shows that it was active but very quickly deactivated with time-on-stream. The main reaction products found were C=H4, CzHa and COZ. Fig. 2 represents the corresponding selectivities and it can be seen that the overall value for the C, hydrocarbons is of the order of 50% (10% for ethylene and the rest for ethane). These two figures show clearly that MgO alone is a catalyst stable with time-onstream once the transient period has passed. A survey of the literature shows that the Mg0 aerogel is much more active and selective towards coupling than the sample studied by Hutchings et al. [ 3 J at the same reaction temperature. Pure PbO could not be studied because of its great volatilization under our reaction conditions. 3.1. Supported lead oxide aerogel catalysts Table 3 indicates the catalytic properties of a series of aerogels made with an atomic ratio (Pb)/(M) constant: 0.5, plus a xerogel for comparison purposes.

Pb0-Mg0 is the most active catalyst of the series; this result is in agreement with the findings of Agarwal et al. [ 17 ] . It exhibits the highest selectivity in CZ + and is the only one to yield a few percent of propane. It is also the solid which has the smallest surface area of the whole series (see Table 2) and this is in line with some conclusions published by Iwamatsu et al. [ 18] who have found that small specific area catalysts are better than ones with a higher specific area. Moreover, Pb0-Mg0 aerogel shows a very good stability with time-on-stream after a small initial decrease of activity as shown in Fig. 3. Very surprisingly, Pb0-SiO, aerogel is totally inactive under our reaction conditions though other Pb0-Si02 systems depicted in the literature showed quite good catalytic properties when oxygen was used instead of nitrous oxide [ 19,20]. It is also known from previous work [ 13] that this type of aerogel may d<:velop a surface area of the order of 600 mz/g and therefore if the 46 G.M. Pajonk, T.

(C, A , O) See Fig. I , (0) propane formation. comparison holds with the results published by Iwamatsu et al.[ 18 ] who used oxygen (and not nitrous oxide), its inactivity can presumably also be related to its very high surface area. Nonetheless, the situation of the Pb0-ZrO, is puzzling as the aerogel is many times more active than the similar xerogel though the former exhibits a higher surface area (four times) than the latter catalyst. Finally according to the basicity of the support oxide, the ranking by decreasing activity in the coupling reaction is: Mg0 > Zr0= > A1=03 > TiO, > > > Si0= which is also the ranking according to the intrinsic activities per m' (Table 3 ), and it follows the general trend already published in the literature [ 19,20] . It is interesting to notice here that when oxygen replaced nitrous oxide, all other conditions being unchanged, the selectivities in C=+ were found to be close to zero and that only carbon dioxide was formed with a rate of methane consumption slightly higher than when nitrous oxide was used. Therefore it seems that these catalysts are very specific towards nitrous oxide activation. This fact is comparable to the case of nitric oxide versus oxygen for nitroxidation reactions [ 15,16 ] . 3.2. Influence of the (Pb)/(Mg) atomic ratio oft the catalytic properties of aerogels While the work published by Agarwal et al. [ 17] demonstrated that addition of small amounts of PbO to MgO increased both activity and selectivity in C= hydrocarbons, Bytyn and Baerns [ 19] concluded that covering the whole surface of the support by a PbO layer gave the same improvement in the catalytic properties, so a series of four Pb0-MgO aerogels with different (Pb) / (Mg) atomic ratios were tested under the same conditions as described above. The results are shown in Table 4; they correspond to methane conversions not greater than 5% (differential conditions). It can be seen that there are no significant differences between the catalysts from the point G.M. Pajonk, T.

The main differences are observed for the specific activities where once again, the standard catalyst looks the best. 3.3. Influence of the composition of the, feed in methane and nitrous oxide on the catalytic behaviour of the standard catalyst According to Roos et al. [7] the nature of the feed composition in methane and oxygen exerts a strong influence upon the selectivity in the coupling reaction: an excess of oxygen levels off the total C, yield and a small residence time combined with a low oxygen concentration increase the C, yields. Three different reacting mixtures, two of them being over stoichiometric with respect to E9. (1) 2CH4+N=O-C',H6+H=O+N= (1) giving the main desired product ethane, i.e. (Pcti,)/(PN=O)=(400)/(50), (200)/(50) and one substoichiometric (PCH, ) / (PN=<,) = (50) / (400) were employed with the standard catalyst at 720. Table 5 summarizes the recorded results. Two conclusions can be drawn from the data collected in Table 5: First, the more overstoichiometric the feed is, the greater are the activities; this in fact corresponds to catalytic tests performed with reducing mixtures. Second, the oxidizing mixture gives the 48 C.M. Pajonk. T Manzalji /Applied Cata(vsis A: General 108 (1994) 41-51 best selectivity towards ethylene and this result is opposite to that reported by Roos et al. [7) who have worked with oxygen instead of nitrous oxide. Under our experimental conditions it seems that the feed compositions do not influence very strongly the overall selectivity in C_ compounds, but it is clear that an oxidizing feed mixture favours the formation of ethylene. 3.4. Reaction mechanism A thorough kinetic study was carried out at 720 on the standard catalyst with a series of reactant mixtures containing fixed partial pressures of methane and nitrous oxide, respectively. Figs. 4 and 5 show the results recorded for the formation of ethane for fixed partial pressures of nitrous oxide and methane, respectively, versus partial pressures of methane and nitrous oxide, respectively. Similar curves were recorded for the disappearance of methane (not shown here) [ 14]. One can readily see that the formation of ethane is first order against P,.,, while it exhibits a partial order for nitrous oxide which decreases from one to zero as Pr,,,) is increased. Furthermore, the higher the fixed partial pressure of one reactant is, the greater is the activity for a given value of the partial pressure of the other reactant. A complete study of the linear transforms of the kinetic curves obtained in differential conditions, not described here, leads the authors to propose a Rideal-Eley model with methane reacting in. the gas phase with adsorbed nitrous oxide without competitive chemisorption [ 14] . All the results fit the classical Rideal-Eley mechanism through Eq. (2) at 720: A =k KN-\" PN O PHa , (2 ) ) PC H4 +KN=,~ N,o/ 400 O~ 300 *w C e 200 ..

A similar equation is also found for the ethane formation rate X14]. The activation energies were determined between 680 and 760 for three representative feeds, their values are given in Table 6 for the consumption of methane and the formation of ethylene and ethane, respectively. The first two E values mentioned for each reactant in Table 6 are related to apparent activation energies E,, since for the corresponding reaction feeds, the kinetic order of nitrous oxide is one, while it is zero in the last case where the activation energies measured, which are the largest ones, are now the true ones. A possible reaction network can be proposed to account for the catalytic results: adsorption of N,O: and reaction between gaseous methane and 0,,,,,: 50 G.M.

Propane can be formed from C,H6: CZ H6 + Oads -j CZ H5 + OHad, followed by reaction with a CH3 radical C2Hs + CH S - C,HH Finally a general picture can represent the whole network based on that proposed earlier by Labinger and Ott [ 22 ] CHa 10 C02, . CH3 . CH3 0' C2H6 10C3H8 1 CZH4 Though kinetic studies are relatively scarce in the literature concerning either PbO supported catalysts or the use of nitrous oxide as oxidizing agent, some differences between the present study and published papers can be observed. For example with lead oxidemagnesia catalysts and oxygen, a Rideal-Eley type mechanism was proposed by Asami et al. [ 23 ] who found a partial order near one for methane and close to zero for oxygen which is exactly analogous to our findings (at least for the formation for C' hydrocarbons). A redox mechanism involving Pb and Pb'+ was suggested by these authors. Now, on LiMgO catalysts employing nitrous oxide, Yamamoto et al. [ 24] reported values for their partial orders equal to zero for methane and one for nitrous oxide, which are opposite to ours. Nevertheless, ,again a Rideal-Eley mechanism was advocated by the last authors. From these results it is tempting to assume that the formation of the methyl radical constitutes the key step of the coupling to C, hydrocarbons (under our conditions) due to the ease of production of the suitably adsorbed oxygen species released by the dissociative chemisorption of nitrous oxide. Wether this species is adsorbed or a lattice oxide cannot be clearly determined at the present time. 4. Conclusions Aerogel catalysts and in particular Pb0-MgO ones, are interesting in the oxidative coupling of methane by nitrous oxide to ethane and ethylene. Their behaviours are relatively similar to other lead based catalytic systems. However, instead of working with nitrous oxide, as we did, working with oxygen as recently described by Matsumura and Moffat for other lead based catalysts, showed results of a Pb0-MgO catalyst which exhibited poor selectivities in ethane and ethylene at 700 [ 25 ] . The same trend was recently reported G.M. Pajonk, T Mati:alji /Applied Catalysis A: General 108 (1994) 41-51 51 with Li-MgO catalysts by Yamamoto et al. [24] in a comparative study of nitrous oxide and oxygen as oxidants. No partial oxidation products (methanol and formaldehyde) were obtained during our tests and therefore the PbO supported aerogels are only selective towards the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane to C= hydrocarbons.

The best catalyst (Pb/Mg = 0.5) gave a C2+ overall selectivity of 69%, a high activity (at W/F = 0.03 g s cm−3) and a good stability with time-on-stream. A kinetic study showed that the reaction is of the Rideal-Eley type with nitrous oxide reacting in the adsorbed phase. Other supports such as Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 and SiO2 were used and the activities recorded agreed well with the basicity of the catalyst, PbO-SiO2 being totally inactive: MgO ≫ ZrO2 ≫ Al2O3 ≫ TiO2 ≫ ≫ ≫ SiO2.
