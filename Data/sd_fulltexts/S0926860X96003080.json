Sarkany * Institute of lsotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 77. Budapest, H-1525, Hungary Received 14 March 1996; accepted 2 August 1996 Abstract Selective semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been investigated in excess of hydrogen over Co, Cu and Pd-Ni catalysts. The results on 5 wt.-% Co/AI203 and Pd-Ni/Nb205 catalysts provide evidence that hydrocarbonaceous materials formed on these surfaces play an important role in governing the competition between 1,3-butadiene and n-butenes. Similar results have been observed on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 modified by preadsorption of n-butylamine. On the poisoned surface hydrogenation and isomerization of n-butenes have been remarkably inhibited, but the sample remains active in semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. It is proposed that the unusual high selectivity of alkene formation is ensured by firmly held adspecies (FHA) formed from diene or n-butylamine. FHA cover and modify metal sites and do not allow adsorption of n-butenes as they apparently cannot compete with FHA. Hydrogenation of diene has been interpreted by a compression-displacement model, in which the high strength of diene complexation plays a definite role. Butadiene 'pushes away' FHA for reason of its high complexation strength and finds (create) reaction sites for its semi-hydrogenation. Preadsorption of CH3OH on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO: affects the regionselectivity of n-butenes: on the modified surface the selectivity of cis-2-butene increases at the expense of 1-butene. These results have been interpreted by electronic modifica- tion of Cu sites by intermediates formed from decomposition of methoxy species.

After fractionation of the steam cracked products selective hydrogenation is widely employed to remove hydrocarbons with a higher degree of unsaturation than the major components of the cut [1]. Extensive fundamental research [2,3] has shown that Pd is sufficiently active and most selective of group VIII transition metals in removal of acetylene and butadiene impurities in the presence of alkenes. The first generation catalysts were Cu based or contained sulfided Ni [4]. These catalysts were less active than Pd and therefore higher operating temperatures were applied. In order to improve the selectivity of competitive hydrogenations Pd based bimetallic catalysts [4] and various additives [5] were employed to influence (i) intrinsic selectivity of hydrogenation, (ii) isomerization versus hydrogenation and (iii) oligomer formation versus hydrogenation. CO is one of the frequently used additives in semi-hydrogenation of acetylene in an ethene stream [6]. The role of CO has been extensively discussed and its effect on hydrogen availability [6], spillover [7] and ethene adsorption [8] has been demonstrated. Effect of nitrogen bases (quinoline, pyridine, piperidine) and sulfur compounds on hydro- genation selectivity has been summarized by Boitiaux et al. [5]. Modification of Co by sulphur and other nonmetals [9], Ni by boron, phosphorus and sulphur [10] influences the intrinsic selectivity of 1,3-butadiene semi-hydrogenation. Variations in 1-butene selectivity and cis/trans ratio of 2-butenes have been attributed to electronic modification of the reaction sites [9,10]. Electron donat- ing compounds like piperidine has been observed to increase both the selectivity towards alkene formation and the rate of hydrogenation of 1-butyne [11,12]. IR investigations have proven that the results can be interpreted by adsorption competition and electronic modification of the metal sites. In hydrogenation of alkyne or butadiene formation of hydrocarbonaceous deposits or residues is almost inevitable at low hydrogen/hydrocarbon ratios. Depending on the experimental conditions these species cover a large fraction of the surface and poison or modify the hydrogenation sites [13-30]. Yasumori et al. [15] have observed that preadsorbed acetylene promotes and stabilizes the active sites for hydrogen addition in hydrogenation of ethene over Pd. Webb and co-workers [16-19] have interpreted hydrogenation as hydrogen transfer be- tween these two types of species considering the high coverage of both dissociatively adsorbed species and the reversibly bonded. However, in hydro- genation of ethene and cyclopropane over Pt catalyst Hattori and Burwell [20] have not observed supporting evidence for hydrogen transfer. Systematic spec- troscopic studies on hydrogenation of ethene have confirmed the ease of formation of ethylidyne at low hydrogen pressures [21-27]. It is apparent now that ethylidyne is a spectator [23-27] rather than a participant in the hydrogena- tion. In hydrogenation of alkene-alkyne or alkene-diene pairs the surface is considered to be covered by diene or alkyne which displaces and prevents alkene adsorption [1-4]. The exact structure and bonding of these species are A. Sarkany / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 209 not clear yet. Based on transient microcalorimetric and FTIR experiments, Maetz and Touroude [28-30] have concluded that semi-hydrogenation requires the continuous presence of less reactive species. They tentatively assign these species as ~2-butyne. In the present paper, data have been collected from our laboratory for the adspecies effect in hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The results show that in hydrogenation of dienes hydrocarbon adspecies play an important role in governing semi-hydrogenation selectivity. Two subjects are presented: (i) Effect of hydrocarbonaceous materials on hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. In a previous paper [31] we have shown that over an amorphous ribbon PdzNisoNb48 self-contamination by hydrocarbonaceous residues causes a rapid suppression of hydrogenation activity for n-butenes even with excess hydrogen. The catalyst in the poisoned state selectively hydrogenates butadiene to n- butenes. The results have been interpreted by compression-displacement of oligomers by complexing diene [31]. (ii) Electron donating compounds are proposed to weaken the strength of the metal-hydrocarbon bond affecting the complexation of alkene to a greater extent than that of diene or alkyne [9-12]. In this work the poisoning effect of CH3OH and n-butylamine (nBA) has been tested on a 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 catalyst of low Cu dispersion. Diene molecules might easily displace these bases from Cu sites, Cu as 'soft' acid interacts only weakly with 'hard' bases such as methanol. One would expect, however, that intermediates (e.g. formaldehyde or butylidene imine) formed by dehydrogenation are firmly held on Cu sites and modify the region selectivity of diene hydrogenation and diene-alkene competi- tion. The objective of these investigations is to understand the mechanism of hydrogenation on surfaces populated by adspecies. 2. Experimental 2.1. Test procedure Hydrogenation experiments were performed in a glass reactor system operat- ing as a recirculating batch reactor (t, = 0.167 dm3) attached to a high vacuum system [31 ]. Gas circulation was accomplished with a recirculation pump driven with a solenoid coil as described earlier [32,33]. The recirculation speed was 2.5 dm3/min. The reactor system was attached through a sampling valve to a Packard 437A gas chromatograph. Butadiene and its products were separated on a 6-m long column packed with bis-(methoxyethyl)adipate (BMEA) at 308 K. Integral product selectivities were calculated in accordance with earlier publications [31-33]: moles of Ci formed were divided by moles of substrate consumed. Conversion refers to butadiene consumed. In a few experiments the carbon content of the catalysts was determined by 210 A. Sarkany / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 temperature programmed oxidation. The CO2 formed was collected in a trap cooled by liquid nitrogen and introduced later through a capillary leak to a Balzers QMG 511 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The reaction between methanol, 2-propanol and deuterium was tested in a recirculation static system attached to an AEI MS 20 mass spectrometer [34]. Deuterium was purified through a heated silver-palladium thimble. In calculat- ing product distribution, the natural abundances of 180, 13C and deuterium were taken into account. Mass spectra and fragmentation pattern were recorded at 15 eV. Deuterium distribution was calculated using the statistical method of Kemball and Anderson [35]. With 2-propanol the analysis was made for the pseudo parent ion (m/z = 45) formed by the loss of CH3. 2.2. Catalysts The catalysts used in this study are listed in Table 1. 5 wt.-% Co/A1203 catalyst was prepared by impregnation Co(NO3)2 on A1203 as described in Ref. [33]. After O2-H2 treatments the sample was characterized by H2 adsorption and CO chemisorption. From hydrogen consumption the calculated degree of reduction of Co precursor is 6%; from the hydrogen uptake the dispersion of the sample reduced at 723 K is 12%. The Pd-Ni/Nb205 catalyst was prepared from an amorphous ribbon of nominal composition PdzNisoNb48 [31]. The ribbon was treated in O2 at 923 K followed by reduction at 623 K. The BET surface area was 1.2 mZ/g. In the reduced catalyst X-ray diffraction identified the presence of Ni, NiO, Nb205 and NbOz phases. In the reduced sample (623 K) formation of beta-hydride phase could not be detected suggesting the formation of mixed Pd-Ni clusters and according to X-ray diffraction only about 80-85% of Ni was in the metallic state. 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 was prepared by the pore filling method using a methano- lic solution of Cu(NO3)2; after calcination at 623 K the catalyst was reduced in a stream of hydrogen at 673 K. Dispersion of the sample was measured by N20 decomposition (0.65 kPa) at 383 K for 30 rain. The dispersion of Cu was calculated from both N2 evolved and H2 consumed in subsequent removal of Os. Accepting an Os/Cus -- 0.5 adsorption stoichiometry the dispersion of the Cu particles is 6-9% [36].

Sarkany / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 211 0.3 wt.-% Pd/AI203 catalyst was prepared by wetting low surface area alpha alumina (BET surface is 5.5 mZ/g) with a diluted methanolic solution of Pd(NH3)4C12 complex. The catalyst was dried at 383 K and reduced in H2 at 743 K. Prior to hydrogenation tests the catalyst was 02 and He treated at 723 K. 3. Results 3.1. Hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene over Co / Al203 and Pd-Ni / Nb205 Previous investigations with Co-Pd catalyst [33] have revealed rapid poison- ing of the 5 wt.-% Co/A1203 catalyst in hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Typical hydrogenation curves (three successive experiments) are presented in Fig. 1. At 288 K consumption of 1,3-butadiene decelerated rapidly with time. In order to get full conversion, the reaction temperature was increased first to 321 K and then to 347 K. The activity decrease is the consequence of rapid self-poisoning which suppresses n-butane selectivity as indicated by the second experiment (arrow B) started at 338 K. The third experiment (arrow C) was performed at 355 K. Between the experiments the sample was evacuated at the temperature of the last sampling. The rate of diene consumption decreased gradually (rates at the highest temperatures are compared): 2.65%/min at 347 K (Exp. A), 1.59%/rain at 358 K (Exp. B) and 0.83%/rain at 355 K (Exp. C).

The effect of poisoning also manifests itself in the suppression of n-butane formation from n-butenes after depletion of butadiene. The experiments show that the rate of n-butane formation is retarded to a larger extent than hydrogenation of diene. Typically, the ratio: n-butane formation/di- ene consumption is 0.15 at 347 K (Exp. A), 0.098 at 358 K (Exp. B) and 0.022 at 355 K (Exp. C). After the completion of the third run the system was evacuated and a new experiment was started with a hydrogen:13C-1,3-butadiene mixture = 4.5 (1.33 kPa BD). After 15 rain the hydrocarbon was frozen out and the catalyst sample was transferred at 295 K into a microreactor and the hydrocarbon was removed by TPO. The TPO spectrum (m/z = 44) showed a broad peak with peak maximum at 507 K. The calculated C4/Co~ ratio evolved from the amount of 13 12C CO2 was 3.7. The C/ ratio in CO2 after correction for natural abundance of 1~3C was only 0.05-0.06 suggesting that most of the deposits formed when butadiene first contacted Co sites. The catalytic behaviour of Pd-Ni/Nb205 sample was tested at 298 K. In separate experiments (only initial rates were measured on regenerated catalyst) reaction orders were determined. At 298 K the diene order was 0.04 and the hydrogen one was 0.98. Based on initial activity, the ratio of diene hydrogena- tion/1-butene consumption (1.33 kPa HC, H2/HC = 3.9) was 0.88 at 298 K. Hydrogenation of diene showed considerable aging as can be judged from the time dependent deceleration of BD consumption (Fig. 2). The catalytic be- haviour of the Pd:NisoNb48 amorphous ribbon revealed similar aging character- istics [31]. After completion of run A in Fig. 2 the reactor was evacuated and the reaction was repeated (arrow B).

The rate of n-butane formation was 4.3 10 2 and 1.2. 10-2 in the first and second run, respectively. In the second run the R(n-butane)/R(butadiene) ratio was 8.2.10-3.

Hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene on 5 wt.-% Cu / SiO: modified by methanol and n-butylamine Hydrogenation behavior of 5 wt.-% Cu/SiOz was investigated between 303 and 373 K using a multi-step temperature programme. A typical experiment is presented in Fig. 4. At 303 K formation of 1-butene prevails, its selectivity being 80-85% which is gradually decreasing with temperature. The cis/trans ratio of 2-butenes is close to one and shows some variation with temperature and H2/BD ratio [36]. The effect of methanol on product selectivity was tested either by preadsorption of CH3OH on the catalyst followed by evacuation and introduction of H z/butadiene mixture or after preadsorption it was left in the reactor and mixed with the BD/H2 mixture. Typical variation of the product selectivity with temperature is presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Additional data are summarized in Table 2. Adsorption of methanol decreases the selectivity for 1-butene and causes an increase in the cis/trans ratio. Similar results have been observed after preadsorption of 2-propanol although its effect on distribution of n-butenes is smaller. Experiments with N20, H20, NH3 and CO are summa- rized in Table 2. N20 was decomposed at 363 K over Cu/SiO2 prior to 214 A.

Peaks at m/z = 60 and 61 were indicative for the formation of methyl formate. The effect of NH3 and n-butylamine (nBA) was tested over 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2. Results with NH3 are included in Table 2. In the presence of NH3 the production of 1-butene is increased by 2-4% and generally more cis-2-butene is formed than trans-2-butene. The effect of n-butylamine on competition of diene and n-butenes is quite significant as observed from kinetic measurements. Fig. 7a and b shows two successive experiments; the first experiment was measured in absence of nBA (Fig. 7a), the secund run in presence of 145 Pa nBA preadsorbed on the catalyst (Fig. 7b). The reaction temperature in both experiments was gradually increased and finally kept at 548 K. As a consequence of nBA adsorption depletion of butadiene from the gas phase is not accompanied by rapid isomerization of n-butenes and immediate acceleration of n-butane formation. The experiment was repeated with a new mixture of hydrogen and butadiene (arrow A).

The hydrocarbons from the trap were evacuated first and then the hydrogen was removed from the reactor. Comparison of the two curves shows that there is only a small change in the activity and the adspecies trapped on the surface are able to prevent readsorption of n-butenes from the gas phase. Addition of hydrogen to the mixture of n-butenes and hydrogen (arrow B) exerted only a minor effect on n-butane formation. The experiment was repeated with the same sample oxidized and reduced in the reactor at 643 K (standard regeneration treatment) and treated with nBA (366 Pa) for 5 min at 351 K. The results are presented in Fig. 8a. The main features of the catalyst remained the same: the presence of nBA preadsorbed on Cu sites apparently prevents adsorption of n-butenes. At arrow A in Fig. 8a the partial pressure of hydrogen was increased to 23.5 kPa but the effect on isomerization or n-butane formation was negligible. The catalyst was then evacuated and the experiment was repeated (arrow B) with a new Hz/BD mixture (22.5 kPa H2 and 1.33 kPa BD). The reaction as can be judged from the rate of butadiene consumption, R = 0.86%/min and 3.07%/min at 6.1 kPa H2 and 22.5 kPa H2, respectively, follows the first order kinetics for hydrogen (a = 0.97). The results also confirm that there are sites on the surface which are still able to dissociate hydrogen and activate 1,3-butadiene but apparently these sites are not available for activation of n-butenes and the surface hydrogen cannot remove (hydrogenate off) adspecies from metal sites. The catalyst sample was then submitted to standard regeneration treatment and a new experiment was performed (Fig. 8b). In the absence of nBA treatment the sample shows its usual activity for isomerization and n-butane formation. The rate of butadiene hydrogenation on the nBA poisoned surface (experiment B) is about 1/3 of the reaction rate observed on the regenerated catalyst. 218 A. Sarkany /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 Table 4 Reaction between nBA and D2 over 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 (nBA = 1.33 kPa, D2/nBA = 17.3, 315 mg catalyst) T, K dt d2 d3 d4 M R (%/min) 373 99.2 0.8 0.02 n.o. 1.01 0.017 423 97.5 1.7 0.8 0.01 1.09 0.13 516 93.5 3.7 2.1 0.7 1.1 0.79 375 a n.o.

The reaction between D2 and nBA was investigated between 373 K and 516 K (Table 4). The exchange of hydrogens decelerated even at low conversions and after reaction at 516 K no activity could be detected at 345 K at all. In the temperature range investigated dI isomer dominated; d2 and d3 isomers ap- peared at 516 K. Temperature programmed reaction of nBA in absence of H2 (2.66 kPa nBA, 26.6 kPa He, 50 K/min ramp) was also tested in the static circulation system. The mass spectra indicated formation of H2 and NH3 above 353 K and 423 K, respectively, and desorption of dibutylamine above 466 K. 4. Discussion The presented results provide additional insight into the effect of adspecies formed either in the course of diene hydrogenation (self-contamination) or preadsorbed on the catalyst surface. Hydrocarbonaceous deposits on Co/AI203 and Pd-Ni/Nb205 and adspecies formed from n-butylamine on Cu/SiO2 apparently influence the competition between diene and n-butenes. The variation of the intrinsic selectivity of diene hydrogenation in presence of methanol emphasizes the electronic effect of the adspecies on catalytic sites. Preadsorbed methanol or 2-propanol on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 influences mainly the distribution of n-butenes. On the sample reduced at 753 K formation of 1-butene prevails, which suggests facile 1,2-addition of hydrogen atoms to adsorbed diene. Enhancement of 2-butene production on Cu sites perturbed by alcohol seems to indicate that 1,4 addition mechanism [2,3] becomes favoured. This observation points to formation of ~-allyl or o-,~ bonded C4H7 species rather than isomerization of 1-butene in the adsorbed phase or through the gas phase. e.3-ca-enteR2 <----> en3-c_H- H-c_~2 <--=> e%_eH~en_cn2 Under the experimental conditions isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butenes can be A.

Reaction sequence in the decomposition of methanol ruled out for the following reasons: (i) the reaction order with respect to diene [36] is - 1 suggesting that alkene adsorption is hindered, (ii) n-butane selectivity is zero (its selectivity is not affected by methanol) which makes the readsorption of 1-butene questionable until diene is present in the gas phase. With the decrease of Cu particles selectivity of 2-butenes has been observed to increase [36] which result can be explained by the ease of formation tr,'rr-olefin or \"rr-allyl c4n7 intermediates in a half hydrogenated state over electron deficient Cu sites. Interaction of alcohol with Cu sites through one of the lone electron pairs of oxygen must be weak as 'soft' acids (Cu+) interact only weakly to 'hard' bases (CH3OH). The weakly adsorbed species act as precursors to dissociative chemisorption: methanol or 2-propanol is attached to the surface through rupture of the O-H bond forming surface alkoxy species which may dehydrogenate by sequential hydrogen removal. The Reaction sequence for decomposition of methanol is presented in Fig. 9. Considering the fact that at 355-373 K we observed only dI and that the single exchange process leading to d2, d3 is almost missing one may safely assume that deuterium is in the hydroxyl group. Formation of multiple deuterated products might be tentatively attributed to the formation of CH20 whose dimerization and further reaction to form methyl formate may explain the rapid poisoning of the exchange reaction. As shown in Table 3, multiple deuterated products are present only in small amounts. The increase in temperature leads to the formation of methyl formate and CO. Over Pd, Pt and Ni [37] the rate of exchange of hydrogen in hydroxyl position is much faster than at alpha carbon. Over Cu this conclusion is also valid for methanol [38] but in the case of ethanol and 2-butanol [39] the exchange at the alpha carbon is faster than in the OH group. Over single crystal planes [40-42] formation of methoxy species is fast and reversible whereas further decomposition requires temperatures higher than 373 K. Our results verify that alkoxide or aldehyde may be present on the Cu sites. It should be noted, however, that the dipole moment of the methoxy species [40] is similar to that of methanol, i.e., there is no significant charge transfer between Cu and oxygen atoms. The presence of CO or oxidation of Cu sites by N20 has not significantly affected the distribution of butenes (Table 2). One may conclude therefore that either r/2(C,O) bonded formaldehyde or formyl species (carbonyl carbon is electrophilic) perturb Cu sites. Although the compo- sition of the surface phase is not known yet, it is clear that the surface species formed from diene feels some electronic changes of Cu as indicated by the enhancement of 2-butenes production. The observed cis/trans ratio 2.33-2.45 220 A. Sarkany /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 can be interpreted by the formation of \"rr-allyl carbocation with restricted rotation around the central C-C bond. The experiments with both 5 wt.-% Co/,AI203 and Pd-Ni/,Nb205 catalysts emphasizes the special role of adspecies formed in the course of aging on these surfaces. It is a typical feature of these experiments that hydrogenation and isomerization of n-butenes decreased to a larger extent than hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. High selectivity of n-butenes formation was also observed on the Cu catalyst poisoned by n-butylamine. In diene hydrogenation the catalytic sites are assumed to be covered by diene adspecies. Owing to their high complexation strength they promote desorption and prevent readsorption of alkene until diene is present in the gas phase even in presence of excess hydrogen. Hydrogen under conditions of selective hydrogenation cannot compete with diene. As the experiments were performed in excess hydrogen after depletion of diene ad- species n-butenes are able to reach the surface sites and they are isomerized and hydrogenated to n-butane as shown by a typical experiment on the 0.3 Pd/,A1203 catalysts in Fig. 3. The variation of the ratio, rate of diene hydrogenation/,rate of n-butane formation over Co/,A1203 and the very limited isomerization over Pd-Ni/Nb205 call our attention to the fact that in the course of hydrogenation on the surface of these catalysts less reactive adspecies are formed which are able to hinder adsorption of n-butenes but, according to the restart experiments, cannot prevent adsorption of diene. The restart experiments also prove that the hydrogen molecules due to their small size are still able to find sites for dissociation on the poisoned surface. The unusual catalytic behaviour of our Pd-Ni/'Nb20~ can be interpreted by the rapid poisoning of the surface sites. Self-contamination is also evident on Co/,AI:O3. The poisoning of sites can tentatively be attributed to the ease of formation of sigma bonded intermediates on Co and Ni. In case of Pd-Ni/,Nb205 the acidic nature of Nb205 also facilitates the retention of hydrocarbonaceous deposits on the support and in the vicinity of metal support interface. As shown in Fig. 2 the selectivity of 1-butene has increased and that of trans-2-butene decreased with aging. Over PdeNisoNb48 ribbons treated with HF the formation of trans-2-butene was faster than that of 1-butene [43] due to the increased acidity of the support. These results provide some indication on the participation of coalesced acid-metal sites at the metal-support interface as apparently the support alone does not isomerize n-butenes. Over Co/,AI203 the coverage of these less reactive materials calculated for surface Co sites give a value of 3.7 C4/Cos. The actual coverage on Co sites is probably smaller since part of the deposits is present on the support. It is of interest that the ratio of 13C/12C after correction for natural abundance of 13C is only 5-6% indicating that deposits are mainly formed at the early stages of reaction and they do not readily exchange with adsorbing 13C-1,3-butadiene. Our results over Co/,A1203, Pd-Ni/,Nb205 and Cu/,SiO2 modified by nBA prove that a certain type of adspecies is able to hinder hydrogenation and A. Sarkany / Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 221 isomerization of n-butenes to a greater extent than hydrogenation of 1,3- butadiene. Reaction between nBA and D2 points to the dissociation of N-H and C-H bonds. The rapid poisoning of exchange reaction and the temperature programmed reaction of nBA seem to indicate that unsaturated intermediates (e.g., butylidene imine or butylidene butylamine) are formed in the course of disproportionation. CH3CH2CHzCHzNH2 ~ CH3CHzCHzCH=NH + H2 CH3CH2CHzCH=NH + CH3CHzCHzCH2NHz ~ CH3CHzCH2CH =N - CH2CH2CH2CH3 + NH3 These unsaturated intermediates are expected to remain firmly held on Cu sites as the surface coverage of hydrogen (surface fugacity of H2) is low. In hydrogenation of acetylene the foulant layer (green oil) has been proposed to influence the rate and ethene selectivity due to transport limitations [6,44,45]. We think, however, that this is not the case for our samples: transport limitation cannot explain the hindrance for hydrogenation of n-butenes. We also think that any interpretation assuming different size of ensembles for hydrogenation of diene and alkene is not convincing either. The low ratio of R(n- butane)/R(butadiene) is proposed to be ensured by firmly held adspecies (FHA) formed from diene or n-butylamine which remain on the surface after depletion of butadiene from the gas phase. These species cover the metal sites and do not allow adsorption of n-butenes as they apparently cannot compete with FHA. For reason of its high complexation strength butadiene 'pushes away' the adspecies and finds (creates) reaction sites for complexation [31]. In this process the reaction sites may become available only by compression of the adlayer of the less reactive surface species as evidenced by Cremer and Somorjai [27] in the hydrogenation of ethene. The possibility that diene extracts metal sites from the surface covered by hydrocarbonaceous species is less likely, although corrosive adsorption of vinylacetylene [5] and terminal acetylenes [46] is known. In the case of acetylenes site extraction process has been invoked to explain semi-hy- drogenation of di-tert-butylacetylene [47]. 5. Conclusions (1) Preadsorbed methanol affects the region selectivity of 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation over Cu/SiO2 of 6-9% dispersion. Adspecies formed increases the selectivity of cis-2-butene and decreases the formation of 1-butene. The change in intrinsic selectivity can be interpreted by electronic modification of Cu sites. Cis/trans ratios 2.33-2.45 have been interpreted by formation of a -rr-allyl carbocation with a restricted rotation around the central C-C bond. (2) Self-contamination of Co/A1203 and Pd-Ni/Nb205 affects the hydro- 222 A. Sarkany/Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 207-223 genation of n-butenes to a larger extent than the semi-hydrogenation of 1,3- butadiene. Similar results were observed on Cu/SiO2 modified by preadsorp- tion of n-butylamine. In the interpretation of the results its is proposed that n-butenes owing to their weak complexation strength cannot get access to reaction sites whereas 1,3-butadiene molecules are able to compete with firmly held adspecies for hydrogenation sites.

Box 77, Budapest , H-1525,Hungary * Tel./fax: (+36-1) 156-4815 Selective semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been investigated in excess of hydrogen over Co, Cu and Pd—Ni catalysts. The results on 5 wt.-% Co/Al2O3 and Pd—Ni/Nb2O5 catalysts provide evidence that hydrocarbonaceous materials formed on these surfaces play an important role in governing the competition between 1,3-butadiene and n-butenes. Similar results have been observed on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 modified by preadsorption of n-butylamine. On the poisoned surface hydrogenation and isomerization of n-butenes have been remarkably inhibited, but the sample remains active in semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. It is proposed that the unusual high selectivity of alkene formation is ensured by firmly held adspecies (FHA) formed from diene or n-butylamine. FHA cover and modify metal sites and do not allow adsorption of n-butenes as they apparently cannot compete with FHA. Hydrogenation of diene has been interpreted by a compression-displacement model, in which the high strength of diene complexation plays a definite role. Butadiene ‘pushes away’ FHA for reason of its high complexation strength and finds (create) reaction sites for its semi-hydrogenation. Preadsorption of CH3OH on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 affects the regionselectivity of n-butenes: on the modified surface the selectivity of cis-2-butene increases at the expense of 1-butene. These results have been interpreted by electronic modification of Cu sites by intermediates formed from decomposition of methoxy species.

        "dc:description": "Selective semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has been investigated in excess of hydrogen over Co, Cu and Pd—Ni catalysts. The results on 5 wt.-% Co/Al2O3 and Pd—Ni/Nb2O5 catalysts provide evidence that hydrocarbonaceous materials formed on these surfaces play an important role in governing the competition between 1,3-butadiene and n-butenes. Similar results have been observed on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 modified by preadsorption of n-butylamine. On the poisoned surface hydrogenation and isomerization of n-butenes have been remarkably inhibited, but the sample remains active in semi-hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. It is proposed that the unusual high selectivity of alkene formation is ensured by firmly held adspecies (FHA) formed from diene or n-butylamine. FHA cover and modify metal sites and do not allow adsorption of n-butenes as they apparently cannot compete with FHA. Hydrogenation of diene has been interpreted by a compression-displacement model, in which the high strength of diene complexation plays a definite role. Butadiene ‘pushes away’ FHA for reason of its high complexation strength and finds (create) reaction sites for its semi-hydrogenation. Preadsorption of CH3OH on 5 wt.-% Cu/SiO2 affects the regionselectivity of n-butenes: on the modified surface the selectivity of cis-2-butene increases at the expense of 1-butene. These results have been interpreted by electronic modification of Cu sites by intermediates formed from decomposition of methoxy species.",
