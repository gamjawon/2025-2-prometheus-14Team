Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) are recognized as promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their compatibility with the existing oil and gas infrastructure, which facilitates large-scale and long-distance storage and transportation. However, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes of traditional organic hydrogen carriers necessitate an external supply of hydrogen and are conducted under high temperature and pressure conditions, raising safety concerns for their practical implementation. This paper introduces a reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage system utilizing quinoline, a nitrogen heterocyclic organic compound, as the hydrogen carrier. In this system, water serves as both the solvent and the hydrogen source for quinoline hydrogenation, with self-supported lamellar NiCoP/NF electrodes function as electrocatalysts. The catalytic performance of NiCoP/NF electrode for electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoline and dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) was evaluated in 1 M KOH solution under mild conditions. The findings revealed that the hydroconversion yield of quinoline was 95 % with a selectivity of 99 %. The dehydroconversion yield of THQ was 81.4 % with a selectivity of 81 %. These results suggest that the system is capable of effectively facilitating reversible hydrogen storage. The NiCoP/NF electrode maintained high catalytic activity even after five cycles, which underscores its excellent stability. The electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoline does not necessitate exogenous hydrogen, thereby conferring the system with superior safety performance. This study presents a sustainable and efficient approach to hydrogen storage within nitrogen heterocyclic organic compounds.

The excessive utilization of these fossil fuels leads to heightened greenhouse gas emissions, thereby exacerbating global warming and environmental pollution. Consequently, the imperative for contemporary energy system evolution lies in the development of renewable energy sources [2]. Hydrogen energy is currently regarded as an excellent alternative to fossil energy sources. It is characterized by low carbon emissions, sustainable use and is environmentally benign. Nevertheless, storage and transportation of hydrogen is a major challenge and has become a bottleneck constraining the development of the hydrogen energy industry [3–5]. However, it is urgent to develop low-energy, low-emission and transformative hydrogen storage technologies to achieve efficient hydrogen storage processes under mild conditions. This is of great significance to realize the goal of carbon neutrality [6]. Traditional hydrogen storage methods, including high-pressure gaseous, low-temperature liquid, and solid-state storage, face issues like high transportation costs, safety concerns, energy intensity, and substantial capital requirements [7–12]. In contrast, the LOHCs are a highly desirable medium for hydrogen storage. At ambient temperatures, LOHCs hydrogen storage can utilize existing petroleum industry infrastructure to enable efficient, safe and convenient storage and transportation of hydrogen [13–15]. The mechanism of LOHCs hydrogen storage involves a reversible catalytic cycle: hydrogenation of unsaturated aromatics and dehydrogenation of the resulting hydrides, facilitating hydrogen storage and release [16]. However, this process conventionally operates at elevated temperatures and pressures. It requires the use of external hydrogen for hydrogenation, which poses a major safety hazard [17,18]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more economical and efficient method of LOHCs method that consumes less energy, aiming for efficient hydrogen storage under mild conditions. The rapid development of new energy generation technology has resulted in reduced electricity costs. Electrochemical hydrogen storage has the potential to rival traditional thermocatalytic methods [19–21]. Electrochemical hydrogen storage is similar to conventional thermocatalytic hydrogenation, primarily differing in that it sources hydrogen from water, not from H2 molecule dissociation. This method is potentially cost-effective and environmentally friendly [22–24]. The advantages of electrochemical hydrogen storage include mild reaction conditions, enhanced safety in storage and transportation, and the ability to regulate hydrogenation rates through potential or current density adjustments [25]. Therefore, electrochemical hydrogen storage emerges as an ideal alternative to traditional thermocatalytic hydrogen storage methods. The efficiency of hydrogen atoms (H*) generation during the electrochemical hydrogenation of LOHCs is a key determinant of the reaction rate [26]. Hence, developing electrocatalysts capable of efficiently facilitating water molecule dissociation is crucial for improving LOHCs conversion efficiency. Presently, noble metal materials like Pd, Ru, and Pt exhibit H* adsorption and desorption properties among electrocatalysts [27–30]. Although these noble metals exhibit excellent performance in terms of performance, their high prices and limited resource availability restrict their popularity in large-scale applications [31]. In recent years, transition metal-based catalysts have proven to be alternatives to precious metal-based catalysts [32,33]. In the field of hydrogen energy, bimetallic phosphides have been widely studied and applied due to their excellent catalytic activity and conductivity [34–36]. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of bimetals can modulate the electronic structure and increase active site exposure [37,38]. The electron cloud of metal atoms tends to shift toward P atoms, thereby rendering the latter partially negatively charged and enabling them to function as proton acceptors. Concurrently, P atoms enhance the adsorption-desorption behavior of H atoms [45,47]. This enhancement improves the affinity of active H* for H2O dissociation can be improved. This affects the conversion rate and selectivity [39]. Considering that the catalytic reaction requires a sufficient number of active sites, nickel foam (NF) with a high specific surface was chosen as the substrate [40–42]. This study presents a novel electrochemical catalytic system utilizing quinoline (q) as a hydrogen carrier. Catalyst precursors were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Then the NiCoP/NF electrocatalyst was fabricated through low-temperature phosphatization. The catalytic performance of NiCoP/NF for electrochemical hydrogenation of q and electrochemical dehydrogenation of THQ (4q) was investigated under ambient conditions. The results demonstrated that the catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of quinoline with water at ambient temperature and pressure. q showed the highest hydrogenation conversion of 95 % and selectivity of 99 %, while 4q showed a dehydrogenation conversion of 81.4 % and selectivity of 81 %. Additionally, water is used as a hydrogen source in this work. This approach effectively avoids the safety issues associated with external hydrogen sources. In conclusion, the developed electrochemical hydrogen storage system effectively addresses the challenges associated with conventional thermocatalytic hydrogen storage methods in practical applications. 2 Experimental sections 2.1 Chemicals materials Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.0–38.0 %), potassium hydroxide (KOH), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), carbamide (CO(NH2)2), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), tert‑Butanol (C4H10O, 99.5 %), acetone (C3H6O) and ethanol (C2H5OH) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Technology Company. Quinoline (C9H7N, 99 %), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (C9H11N, 97 %) and dioxane (C4H8O2, 99.5 %) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Company. Nickel foam (NF) was purchased from Suzhou Taili foam metal factory. Nafion117 membrane were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were directly used as received without further purification. All aqueous solutions were prepared using ultrapure water obtained from a Heal Force ultrapure water machine. All chemicals without standard concentrations were analytically pure. The model number and test parameters of the specific characterization instrument are placed in Supplementary A1. 2.2 Pretreatment of NF and nafion117 membrane The commercial NF was cut into pieces measuring 4 × 3 cm2. Subsequently, the NF was subjected to ultrasonic treatment in acetone, 3.0 M HCl aqueous solution and water for 15 min each. The NF was then rinsed sequentially with water and anhydrous alcohol. Finally, it was rapidly dried under ambient conditions for later use [43]. The Nafion117 membrane was immersed in a 5 wt% aqueous H2O2 solution at 80 °C for 1 h to remove organic impurities. The membranes were subsequently rinsed with water and heated at 80 °C for 1 h to ensure complete removal of residual H2O2. The membranes were immersed in a 1 M H2SO4 solution and heated at 80 °C for 1 h to convert them to the H + form via ion exchange, thereby enhancing proton conductivity and removing metal ions. Subsequently, the membranes were rinsed with water and immersed in water preheated at 80 °C for 1 h to completely remove any residual H2SO4 [39]. 2.3 Synthesis of electrodes In a typical synthesis [35], Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol), NH4F (8 mmol), and CO(NH2)2 (10 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL of H2O. The solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. The solution was then placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave together with the pretreated NF. and heated to 120 °C for 6 h. The NiCoP/NF precursor was next washed with H2O and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 8 h. To synthesize NiCoP/NF, the NiCoP precursor was first placed in the center of the tube furnace and 2.0 g of NaH2PO2 was placed in front of it. Subsequently, the tube furnace was heated up to 350 °C at a ramp rate of 3 °C/min and maintained at this temperature for 2 h in an argon atmosphere to complete the synthesis process. Finally, the 4 × 3 cm2 NiCoP/NF electrode was cut into 1 × 3 cm2 working electrodes. 2.4 Product quantifications “Conv.” is calculated by dividing the millimoles of product obtained by the millimoles of the base material consumed. “Sel.” is calculated by dividing the hydrogenation product by the millimoles of the substrate initially added.

At the initial stage, NiCo-OF/NF was prepared by low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis as an intermediate. Subsequently, the intermediate was further converted to the target product NiCoP/NF by low-temperature phosphorylation reaction. The microstructures of the electrocatalysts prepared at each synthesis step were characterized using SEM and TEM. The NiCo-OF/NF flakes were interwoven to create a three-dimensional network structure, thereby enhancing mechanical stability. The four elements are uniformly distributed across the NF (Supplementary Fig. 2). Following low-temperature phosphorylation, the NiCoP/NF sheet laminates uniformly cover the NF, with the surface exhibiting a slightly rough texture, as observed in the SEM images in Fig. 2 a and b. The results of EDS analysis and SEM elemental mapping analysis showed that the elements of Ni, Co and P showed a uniform distribution in the electrode materials (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The TEM images in Fig. 2c reveal that the NiCoP/NF nanosheets measure approximately 200 nm in size, confirming the successful fabrication of the hierarchical sheet-like structure. The HRTEM images in Fig. 2d and e display lattice fringe spacings of 0.22 nm and 0.33 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (301) crystal planes, respectively. As evidenced by the HAADF image in Fig. 2f, the elements Ni Co and P are uniformly distributed throughout the lamellar NiCoP/NF material. These results indicate that the NiCoP/NF materials with a hierarchical structure have been successfully synthesised. The physical and compositional analysis of the synthesized electrocatalysts was performed using XRD. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the diffraction peaks at 44.5°, 51.8° and 76.4° can be classified as the standard peaks of metallic nickel (JCPDS No 87–0712). The signal of the diffraction peak of NiCoP becomes weaker because the intensity of the diffraction peak of NF is too strong. The diffraction peaks at 41°, 44.9°, 47.6°, 54.4° and 54.7° can be well assigned to the (111), (201), (210), (300), (002) faces of NiCoP (JCPDS No 71–2336). The chemical composition and elemental states of the NiCoP/NF electrode surface were thoroughly investigated by XPS analysis. The XPS full-spectrum mapping confirmed the presence of the elements Ni, Co, and P in the samples, which coincided with the results of the elemental distribution mapping, confirming the homogeneous distribution of these elements in the electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 3b, the Niδ+ (0<δ<2) signal peaks can be detected in the Ni 2p spectrum at 852.8 eV and 870.0 eV. The strong peaks of Ni2+/3+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+/3+ 2p1/2 are located at 856.7 eV and 874.8 eV, respectively, which may be the signal information of Ni bound to P. The satellite peaks are located at 861.7 eV and 880.3 eV, respectively [44,45]. In Fig. 3c, strong peaks of Co2+/3+ 2p3/2 and Co2+/3+ 2p1/2 can be detected at 782.0 eV and 798.5 eV in the Co 2p spectrum, which may be the signal information of Co bound to P. The peaks at 775.5 eV, 778.0 eV and 790.5 eV are Coδ+ (0<δ<2) signal peaks. The satellite peaks are located at 786.3 eV and 804.4 eV respectively [46–48]. In Fig. 3d, the P 2p spectrum exhibited two principal peaks. The first principal peak is attributed to phosphorus in the form of metal phosphide, with binding energies of 129.3 eV and 130.0 eV corresponding to the P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 respectively. The intense peak at 134.4 eV is ascribed to P-O bonding. The phosphate formed in the reaction probably originates from the partial oxidation of the phosphide surface [49,50]. This phenomenon is commonly observed in metal phosphides. In Supplementary Fig. 6 shows the O 1 s region, where the peak at 532.4 eV can be attributed to P-O bonding in phosphates, while the other two peaks at 530.9 and 531.5 eV correspond to metal-oxygen bonding and water molecules adsorbed on the surface, respectively [35]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline The composition of the electrolyte significantly affects both the activity and product distribution in electrochemical conversion processes. The q molecule contains both a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, both of which are hydrophobic aromatic rings. This results in weak interactions between q and water molecules, leading to its low solubility in water. To enhance the interactions between q and water, we introduced dioxane. The oxygen atoms in dioxane molecules can form weak hydrogen bonds with q molecules, thereby further enhancing the hydrogenation reactions between q and water [27,63]. Therefore, we examined the effect of electrolyte on the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of q. We further explored the specific influence of dioxane on the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of NiCoP/NF electrodes using a mixed solution of 1.0 M KOH/dioxane (6:1 v/v, 42 mL) and 1.0 M KOH (42 mL) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Supplementary Fig. 7 shows that the current density is reduced in the presence of dioxane compared to its absence. This suggests that dioxane exerts a modest inhibitory effect on the electrochemical hydrogenolysis of NiCoP/NF electrodes. Fig. 4 a shows LSV curves before and after adding 0.2 mmol q to the electrolyte. Initially both curves showed a low starting potential of approximately 0 V vs. RHE. After the addition of 0.2 mmol q, the current density increases significantly. This suggests that the electrochemical reduction of q is more facile than the conversion of hydrogen ions to hydrogen in water. The former is more likely to accept electrons due to its lack of electron properties. Fig. 4b shows that q can be electroreduced from −0.05 V to −0.35 V vs. RHE. At different potentials of conversion for 5 h, q can be converted up to 84 % at −0.2 V vs. RHE with a selectivity of up to 99 %. The conversion of q did not change much at increasing potentials. No by-products associated with benzene ring hydrogenation were observed at any of the tested potentials. This demonstrates good regioselectivity. Fig. 4c shows the almost complete conversion of q to 4q with 95 % conversion and 99 % selectivity within 6 h at an optimum potential of −0.2 V vs. RHE. The results indicate that the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of q can be completed in 6 h at −0.2 V vs. RHE. Fig. 4d shows GC–MS plots of the cathode electrolyte at different electrocatalytic times. By observation it can be seen that the peak area of 4q gradually increases with increasing time and is almost free of spurious peaks. Fig. 4e illustrates the durability assessment of the NiCoP/NF electrodes, which was conducted by applying a constant potential of −0.2 V vs. RHE. After the complete consumption of the initially added 0.2 mmol q, an equal amount of q was subsequently added. After five cycles, current variation remains stable. The conversion rate exhibited a slight decrease, while selectivity remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 8). This indicates good catalytic activity during cycling experiments. In addition, SEM and XPS were employed to characterise the morphology and composition of NiCoP/NF electrodes undergoing five hydrogenation cycles. The SEM (Supplementary Fig. 9) results indicate that the morphology of the electrode changed after the hydrogenation reaction, but the surface of the electrode still retained the layered structure. The surface of the lamellar structure becomes smoother and the major elements were still present. The XPS spectra (Supplementary Fig. 10) showed no significant changes in the valence and binding states of the electrodes used, where the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the major elements decreased. This implies that the separation of the electrode surface material leads to a decrease in the content of NiCoP after several cycles. This also confirms the SEM characterisation results. The comprehensive analysis results show that although the surface morphology of the electrode has undergone a significant transformation, its main components remain relatively stable. Therefore, it can be inferred that the NiCoP/NF electrode can maintain its excellent catalytic activity after many cycles of use. Reflecting the good durability of the NiCoP/NF electrodes in the electrocatalytic process. To verify the central role of H* in the q-hydrogenation reaction, t-BuOH, a H* scavenger, was introduced into the cathodic electrolyzer at a concentration of 2 mmol at different stages of the reaction. Fig. 4f shows a significant decrease in the conversion of q, which implies that H* is required for the hydrogenation reaction of q and that water provides the hydrogen source for the conversion of q to 4q. Based on the above experiments, the possible reaction mechanism diagram for quinoline is shown in Fig. 5 . Firstly q is adsorbed on the surface of NiCoP/NF electrodes in a planar adsorption manner and accepts an electron and is reduced to form the q radical anion, while water is reduced on the surface of the NiCoP/NF electrodes to produce H* [17,27]. Subsequently, the q radical anion produces the hydrogenated product dihydroquinoline (2q) on the surface of the material with the H* radical. 2q combines with another H* radical to give 4q. The final 4q is desorbed from the NiCoP/NF electrodes surface [51,52]. NiCoP/NF electrodes exhibit excellent performance, which is attributed to the synergistic effect that exists between Ni and Co bimetallic ions. Specifically, the activity of the Ni sites on the electrode surface promotes the dissociation process of water molecules, while the Co sites enhance the generation and release efficiency of H* radicals. P regulates the electron density through electron effects, providing more active centers [35,45,47]. 3.3 Electrocatalytic dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline The prepared NiCoP/NF electrode exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic performance, which not only effectively catalyzes the electrochemical hydrogenation of q, but also serves as an electrocatalyst for the 4q dehydrogenation reaction. We investigated the effect of dioxane on the hydrogenation of NiCoP/NF electrodes using the same mixture of solutions as for the hydrogenation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 11). The current densities in the presence of dioxane were slightly lower than those in the absence of dioxane. Both curves show a distinct oxidation peak at 1.44 V vs. RHE, which is attributed to the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+(NiOOH) [53,54]. Fig. 6 a shows LSV curves before and after adding 0.2 mmol 4q to the electrolyte. In the prepared NiCoP/NF electrodes, the significant enhancement of current density was attributed to a small amount of conversion of Ni2+ to NiOOH on the electrode surface, which was directly involved in the electrochemical oxidation process of 4q, thus facilitating the generation of larger reaction currents. Since the substrate material of the electrode is NF, we conducted a control test to examine whether NF has a catalytic effect on 4q (Supplementary Fig. 12). The results showed that the current intensity of the NF electrode was significantly weaker than that of the NiCoP/NF electrode. The catalytic effect of NF electrode on 4q at different potentials was small. Therefore, the influence factor of substrate material was excluded. As shown in Fig. 6b, the electrochemical dehydrogenation conversion and selectivity of 4q collected at different potentials over a period of 1 h were recorded in detail. The results showed that the NiCoP/NF electrode achieved 75.3 % dehydrogenation conversion and 85 % selectivity for 4q at the optimal potential of 1.4 V vs. RHE. The results showed that the NiCoP/NF electrode was able to achieve a high dehydrogenation conversion and 85 % selectivity. Subsequently, the conversion and selectivity of electrochemical dehydrogenation of 4q were investigated for different reaction times at an optimal potential of 1.4 V vs. RHE as shown in Fig. 6c. The results showed that the conversion could reach up to 81.4 % and the selectivity up to 81 % when the reaction time reached 2 h (Supplementary Fig. 13). When the reaction time continued to increase, there was a slight increase in the conversion, but the selectivity appeared to decrease substantially. This may be due to the impurities in the 4q stock solution that undergo a large number of side reactions at high potentials thus leading to reduced selectivity. From Fig. 4d, it can be seen that at a constant potential of 1.4 V vs. RHE, the current density was decreasing drastically in 1 h, and most of the 4q was dehydrogenated into q. This indicates that the dehydrogenation process of 4q is fast and efficient. Therefore, 1.4 V vs. RHE can be considered as a suitable dehydrogenation potential. In order to determine whether the NiCoP/NF electrode can maintain good catalytic activity after multiple dehydrogenation cycles of use. Durability experiments were performed on the electrodes at 1.4 V vs. RHE (Supplementary Fig. 14). It can be seen that the conversion of 4q by NiCoP/NF electrode can still be maintained at 78 % with 83 % selectivity after five cycles of testing. After the cycling test, the surface of the recycled NiCoP/NF electrode was partially corroded (Supplementary Fig. 15), but these changes also exposed the previously masked active sites, generating new active sites and maintaining the high performance level of the catalyst. Table 1 details the operating parameters of the hydrogen storage system with q as the hydrogen carrier. It can be seen that most of the conventional thermal catalytic methods will use H2 as the hydrogen source, and usually require more demanding conditions such as high temperature and high pressure to provide enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier of the reaction. This has certain safety hazards. The hydrogen storage system proposed in this study has the ability to accomplish reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage under mild conditions. Water is employed as a proton source instead of hydrogen. Meanwhile, the catalyst is prepared by using transition metals as raw materials, which effectively solves the problem of high cost of precious metal catalysts. Compared with the current electrocatalytic system, the catalyst in this study has a greater advantage in conversion and selectivity in the hydrogenation reaction of quinoline, and can successfully catalyze the conversion of 4q to q. Therefore, the hydrogen storage system has the comprehensive advantages of green, safety and economy. 4 Conclusions In this study, we successfully constructed an efficient and reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage system using quinoline/THQ as the hydrogen carrier. The experimental results show that the hydrogenation conversion of quinoline reaches 95 % at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a selectivity as high as 99 %. Conversely, the dehydrogenation conversion of THQ was 81.4 % with 81 % selectivity. During electrochemical hydrogenation, the NiCoP/NF electrode generates a hydrogen source (H*) by reducing water. This effectively averts the safety hazard of utilizing exogenous hydrogen, and the Ni2+ present in the NiCoP/NF electrode during dehydrogenation effectively promotes the reaction. The results of cyclic hydrogenation tests confirm that the NiCoP/NF electrodes exhibit excellent durability. Compared with conventional hydrogen storage technologies, the electrochemical hydrogen storage system proposed in this study shows significant advantages in terms of safety and environmental friendliness. The transition metal phosphides are more economical compared to the precious metal catalysts in the conventional LOHCs system. The hydrogen storage fluids of quinoline and THQ used in this work are also likely to be applied in existing oil transportation equipment. Therefore, this study may provide a new strategy for the development of low-cost, green and secure hydrogen storage technologies.

        "dc:description": "Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) are recognized as promising candidates for hydrogen storage due to their compatibility with the existing oil and gas infrastructure, which facilitates large-scale and long-distance storage and transportation. However, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes of traditional organic hydrogen carriers necessitate an external supply of hydrogen and are conducted under high temperature and pressure conditions, raising safety concerns for their practical implementation. This paper introduces a reversible electrochemical hydrogen storage system utilizing quinoline, a nitrogen heterocyclic organic compound, as the hydrogen carrier. In this system, water serves as both the solvent and the hydrogen source for quinoline hydrogenation, with self-supported lamellar NiCoP/NF electrodes function as electrocatalysts. The catalytic performance of NiCoP/NF electrode for electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoline and dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) was evaluated in 1 M KOH solution under mild conditions. The findings revealed that the hydroconversion yield of quinoline was 95 % with a selectivity of 99 %. The dehydroconversion yield of THQ was 81.4 % with a selectivity of 81 %. These results suggest that the system is capable of effectively facilitating reversible hydrogen storage. The NiCoP/NF electrode maintained high catalytic activity even after five cycles, which underscores its excellent stability. The electrochemical hydrogenation of quinoline does not necessitate exogenous hydrogen, thereby conferring the system with superior safety performance. This study presents a sustainable and efficient approach to hydrogen storage within nitrogen heterocyclic organic compounds.",
