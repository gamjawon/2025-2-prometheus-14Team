MERIAUDEAU and C. NACCACHE Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, C.N.R.S., 2 Avenue Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex (France) (Received January 14, 1990; accepted January 29, 1990) Introduction It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aro- matics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites [1-7]. It is agreed that over HZSM-5, the dehydrogena- tion of propane into propene and the concurrent cracking reaction into methane and ethene are catalyzed by protons. It was found that the con- version of propane increased with the acidity of HZSM-5, i.e., with Al content. Recent publications have indicated that over Ga203-HZSM-5 zeolites, additional dehydrogenation of propane occurred over Ga203 [8, 9]. Furthermore, it was shown that H^ was heterolytically dissociated over Ga203 [10]. Since it was considered that the dehydrogenation of propane is difficult over H\"1\" but rather rapid over Zn^-HZSM-5 [2] or Ga-HZSM-5 [3,5], factors such as the zinc or gallium content would increasingly influence the conversion of propane. In fact, a careful analysis of published results [6, 8, 9] indicates that the intrinsic dehydrogenating properties of gallium in Ga203-HZSM-5 catalysts are better than those of pure Ga203. The possible interpretation, that over Ga203-HZSM-5 a dual site mechanism involving both Ga203 and H\"1\" is operative for propane de- hydrogenation, has prompted us to reinvestigate the dehydrogenating activity of Ga203 as a function of the zeolite acidity. Experimental Catalyst preparation NaZSM-5 zeolite was synthesised according to a procedure available in the literature in the presence of tetrapropylammonium bromide. The H-form was obtained via ammonium exchange and calcination of the Na- form. Gallium oxide-supported zeolites were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, using an aqueous solution of Ga(N03)3. The catalysts were dried at 373 K and then calcined at 773 K under flowing 0304-5102/90/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L32 oxygen. The chemical composition of the zeolite was measured by absorp- tion spectrophotometry. The synthesized ZSM-5 was characterized by Si/Al = 15. 5 wt.% Ga was introduced onto both the Na-form (sample A) and H-form (sample B). Samples A and B were then calcined under O^ at 773 K. The sodium-form Ga2C>3-NaZSM-5 (sample A) was converted into H-form, by exchange with NH4C1 solution followed by calcination at 773 K (sample A'). Conversely, the H-form Ga203-HZSM-5 (sample B) was transformed into Na-form-supported Ga^O^ by re-exchange with NaCI solution (sample B'). It was obvious that during these re-exchange operations Ga was not lost from the zeolite, since it is known that Ga203 is almost insoluble in NH4C1 or NaCI solution. Catalytic reactions Catalytic evaluations were carried out at atmospheric pressure using a continuous fixed-bed microreactor. The desired conversions were obtained by choosing the appropriate weight sample/flow rate ratios. The reaction of propane was studied at 773 K with 760 torr CaHg. Feed and products were analyzed on an IGC 120 FB Intersmat gas chromatograph equipped with a Shimadzu CR 3A data processor. Before starting the reaction, the catalyst packed into the microreactor was slowly heated in flowing oxygen to 773 K. Results In Table 1 are listed the conditions of catalytic tests, the conversion of propane into methane and ethylene and the rates of overall propene formation, considering that aromatics are issued from ^. The rates of reaction are given in arbitrary units, normalized to rate of C^Rf, production on 5 wt.% Ga203-NaZSM-5 (sample A). In order to study the role of H\"1\" and Ga203 in the formation of propene from propane, it was important to minimize the consecutive oligomeriza- tion and aromatization of the propene. As shown in Table 1, at low propane conversion the yield of aromatics is small and the main product is propene. The Table shows, in agreement with the literature, that deposition of 5 wt.% Ga203 onto HZSM-5 greatly enhances the rate of propene formation with respect to HZSM-5 catalyst. The rate of methane formation which corresponds to the cracking activity of the catalyst is very small for the non-acidic Na-form zeolites (samples A and B'). In contrast, propane is cracked at a significant rate over H-form zeolites. It is worth pointing out that an almost identical rate of CH4 formation is obtained on pure HZSM-5 and Ga2C>3-doped HZSM-5, which indicates that the deposition of Ga203 onto HZSM-5 does not generate proton acid sites [3, 5]. Table 1 further confirms that deposition of Ga203 onto HZSM-5 greatly enhances the rate of propene formation. The striking feature ob- served in this study is the role of the acidity on the apparent activity of Ga203 for the dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, by converting the (0 4J '5 \" i's'-sl a) C 2 ^ C ^Q iS^ CO i^11 'S 11 3 \" Sl^ o -S.B w .2 E3 1 as s a tf^\"- n s. u CO 'S y 0).c ' n B 11 & s'L 0 2 o S ^ + 01 *-><a fQ w ^~^ 0 a 'in '+3a fn 0 ^3 S O u^ 0 Si w >> M -w 'p 00 I-C~ ' 3S 11 4Ja ^ rtU S S, i^ '^3-^ 8 o w1 (U C ^ S 0 tg s U - 10 M N 0) ^9 a ^ ^ ^^^ 20) r. a &. c- ^ b S w % '33s- 0. 0 S.

KS !l! 1003 1003 100) 1005 L34 GaaOa-Na form (sample A) into the Ga203-H form (sample A') a two-fold increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed. Conver- sely by changing the Ga203-H form (sample B) into the non-acidic GaiC^- Na form (sample B'), a 100-fold decrease in the dehydrogenation rate of propane is observed. Thermodynamic calculations for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at 773 K would give an equilibrium conversion propane-> propylene around 16% at a total pressure of 1 atm [2]. This equilibrium conversion of 16% is much larger than the conversions reported in the Table 1, which indicates that the equilibrium propane -> propene is not established in our experimental conditions. Thus, the increase in the dehydrogenation rate of propane into propene by substituting Ga2C>3- NaZSM-5 with Ga203-HZSM-5 is a true kinetic effect, which will not neces- sarily depend on the subsequent reactions, such as oligomerisation and aromatisation, which occur. It has been shown that Ga203 has an intrinsic catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation [8, 9]. Thus, one could conclude that the higher dehydrogenation activity of Ga203 supported on HZSM-5 over the Ga2C>3- NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase. However, it is difficult to explain how the support acidity could increase the surface area of the supported oxide phase by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it appears rather improbable that back-exchange of Ga203- HZSM-5 with NaCI (sample B') will drastically reduce the surface area of the supported Ga203. Consequently, the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of the Ga203-HZSM-5 in comparison of the Ga203-NaZSM-5 catalyst was not expected on the basis of Ga203 dispersion, but rather on the basis of a bifunctional reaction where both Ga203 and H\"*\" intervene. On HZSM-5 the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows [2]: C^s + H+ > C^ + H2 (1) C^ > C^Hf, + H-^ (2) Reaction (1) is slow and is apparently the rate-limiting step. It is obvious that propyi carbenium ions could be also formed on Lewis acid sites, via hydride ion abstraction. Over Ga203, we might suggest [11] that C3Hg is heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed, thus forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. Apparently this reaction is fast. H C3H7 Galc+-0 -Ga^c+ + CaHg > Gax+-0~~-Gax+ (3) These alkoxides would decompose further to form dehydrogenation products and H\"*\" bound to surface oxygen. This reaction is slow and is the limiting step of the formation of propene. H- CaH^ Ir H+ Gax+-0 -Ga+x > Ga^-O-'-Ga^ + C^ (4) L35 H~ H+ Ga^-O '-Ga^ > Ga^-0-r-Ga^ + H, (5) When both Ga2C>3 and H\"1\" are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyi carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyi surface migration reaction: H 03117 H H GaA;+-0 -Ga3c+ + HZ ^==? Ga+x-0 -Ga+a + C3H7 + Z (6) This is a reasonable assumption in view of the high mobility of protons in zeolites, and the high instability of gallium alkyi compounds [12]. Prop- yiene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium: CaH^Z ^= CaHe+H^ (7) Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOC3H7 > GaOH + CaHg which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6). The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydro- genating activity of Ga2C>3-HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga- NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental findings; propene hydrogenation was not observed during a D^-Cyf-l^ ex- change study in the range 413-503 K [13]. Similarly, in this study, Ga203-based catalysts were found to be almost inactive for the hydrogena- tion of propene up to 503 K, which rules out that dehydrogenation- hydrogenation reactions over Ga^O^ proceed via a classical mechanism. Conclusion It has been established that dehydrogenation of propane over Ga^Of- HZSM-5 zeolite occurs through a gallium alkoxide intermediate which rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyi car- benium ion. Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium ion, releasing H\"*\". Three different mechanisms for the dehydrogenation of propane would operate: (i) Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H7\"1\" carbenium ions through hydride abstraction is the slow and limiting step. (ii) Over Ga203, CaHg is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOC3H7. The decom- position of this intermediate into C^H^ and GaOH is the slow, limiting step. (iii) Over Ga203-HZSM-5, surface alkyi migration and exchange between GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes L36 (i) and (h). The formation of CaH./ on Zn\"1\"1\" ions in ZSM-5 has already been suggested in [2]; similar results and a similar mechanism will be re- ported subsequently.
