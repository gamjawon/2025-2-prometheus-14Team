In recent decades, great efforts have been made to prepare non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are considered as the most promising candidates. Here, a novel Co-N-C catalyst was prepared via a simple one-pot method, Co(HNCN)2 was utilized as a single precursor to provide carbon, nitrogen and cobalt source. The as-prepared Co-CN-600 exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.796 V, close to that of commercial Pt/C, the four-electron path was confirmed by Koutecky-Levich equations and RRDE test. In addition, Co-CN-600 possessed better long-term stability and stronger methanol tolerance than Pt/C. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords N-doped carbon Oxygen reduction reaction Carbon materials Electrocatalyst 1 Introduction The ever-increasing demand for clean energy, environmental protection, and emission reduction calls for storage and conversion devices with high efficiency and low pollution [1]. Fuel cells and metal-air batteries are considered to be potential substitutes for traditional energy systems [2–4]. As an essential process in the oxygen electrode, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) possesses intrinsically sluggish kinetics [5,6], which greatly hinders the commercialization of those devices. For ORR, Pt-base materials are the most commonly used commercial catalysts. Nevertheless, their scarcity, high cost, and low stability significantly prohibit the large-scale application [7,8]. For decades, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to searching for non-noble metal and metal-free catalysts as alternatives for Pt-based catalysts. Among them, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) (MFe, Co, Ni) catalysts are considered as the most potential candidates owing to their great activity and considerable stability [9]. Typical preparations for M-N-C often require metal, nitrogen and carbon source, some of which even involve templates that may provide porous structure or electrical conductivity, leading to complex chemical steps or even hazardous operation in the process of removing templates [10]. Thus, a labor-saving and non-toxic preparation method should be considered. With this in mind, we performed a simple one-pot method, using Co(HNCN)2 as a single precursor to prepare non-precious catalysts for ORR. Here, Co(HNCN)2 acts as metal, nitrogen and carbon source simultaneously. The as-prepared catalysts possess superior ORR activity, superb long-term stability, and robust methanol resistance. 2 Experimental All the preparation processes were operated at room temperature. Co(HNCN)2 was prepared via a modified method on the basis of the previous report [11]. In details, CoCl2·6H2O (3.55 g, 15 mmol) was placed in a three-necked flask. To get rid of the oxygen in the reaction system, the flask was flushed out with Ar gas and then vacuumed by a vacuum pump. The vac-refill cycles were repeated for three times. After that, 25 ml ammonia (25 wt%) and 5 ml cyanamide (50 wt%) were injected into the flask. In flowing argon, the solution was stirred for several hours until a pink deposit was yield. The deposit was filtered, washed with deionized water followed by the drying under vacuum. The as-dried samples were annealed at designed temperatures (500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C, 2 °C min−1) in a tube furnace under Ar flow for 1 h. The pyrolysis products were acid-washed with 6 M HCl solution for 24 h under room temperature to eliminate the unstable phases and impurities, then washed with deionized water and dried at 50 °C in vacuum overnight. The final black powders are designated as Co-CN-T, where T represents calcination temperature. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was operated on Gemini SEM 500 to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the samples. Raman spectra were carried out using a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer (514 nm). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi with monochromatized Al Kα being the source, and C 1 s peak at 284.4 eV being the internal standard. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was executed on a RINT2000 vertical goniometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 100 mA) radiation. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were established at 77 K on Quantachrome instrument. The specific surface areas (SBET) were obtained by the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller method. The ORR performance of Co-CN-Ts was tested via the rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) techniques in a CHI760D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua Co., China) in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH circumstance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were implemented in a three-electrode cell (a glassy carbon rotating disk, an HgO/Hg electrode, and a platinum wire serve as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively). The sample inks were obtained as follows: 5 mg of the catalysts or 20 wt% Pt/C were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol and 50 μL 5 wt% Nafion aqueous solution (DuPont) followed by undergoing 0.5 h of ultrasonication. Next, 10 μL of the well-dispersed suspensions were dropped on a glassy carbon electrode (RDE, 5 mm diameter, pine) and dried naturally. CV and LSV were performed after purging the electrolyte (KOH solution) with O2 or N2 for 0.5 h. The potential range is from −0.8 to 0.3 V (vs. HgO/Hg), and the scan rate is 10 mV s−1. The rotating speed is 400, 625, 900, 1225 and 1600 rpm. To obtain stable figures, 20 CV cycles were performed before the actual measurements. Koutecky-Levich equations were used to evaluate the kinetic current density and electron transfer number. Below are the equations: (1) J − 1 = J L − 1 + J K − 1 = B − 1 ω − 1 / 2 + J K − 1 (2) B = 0.2 nF C 0 D 0 2 / 3 v − 1 / 6 where J signifies the obtained current density, J L and J K represent the diffusion-limiting and kinetic -limiting current densities, ω means the angular velocity of the disk, the B factor denotes the slope acquired by linear fitting according to the Eq. (1), n is the electron-transfer number and it can be calculated through Eq. (2), F denotes the Faraday constant (96,485C mol−1), C 0 is the bulk concentration of O2 (1.26 × 10−6 mol cm−3), D 0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s−1), and v is the corresponding kinetic viscosity (0.01 cm2 s−1). To further investigate the ORR process, RRDE tests were operated to evaluate the selectivity of the samples. The RRDE working electrode consists of a glassy carbon disk (5.61 mm in diameter, pine) and a Pt ring (6.25 mm in I.D. and 7.92 mm in O.D., pine). The ink preparation was identical to RDE. The four-electron selectivity of the samples could be estimated according to the H2O2 yield obtained by the following equation: (3) H 2 O 2 % = 200 × I R / N I R N + I D The electron transfer numbers in the ORR process could be estimated by the ensuing equation: (4) n = 4 × I D I R N + I D where I D and I R symbolize the measured currents of disk and ring, respectively. N = 0.37 represents the ring collection efficiency of the Pt ring. The HgO/Hg electrode was calibrated and transformed to RHE, E (RHE) = E (HgO/Hg) +0.910 V. (Fig. S1). 3 Results and discussion FESEM was performed to explore the structure and morphology of the Co-CN-T samples. Fig. 1a–c present the FESEM images of Co-CN-Ts (T = 600, 700, 800 °C). The catalysts calcined at different temperatures show diverse structures. As can be seen in the image, Co-CN-600, which was calcined at 600 °C, possesses porous bubble structure with cobalt particles uniformly dispersing in the sample (for its backscattered electron image see fig. S2). When the calcination temperature rises to 700 °C, more bamboo-like structure begins to appear, and the image consists of a bubble-like structure and bamboo-like structure. As for Co-CN-800, the image seems more uncluttered, with more bamboo-like carbon nanotubes occupying the figure, and the corresponding backscattered electron image reveals that the cobalt particles are located at the tip of the bamboo-like carbon nanotube. Previous reports have discovered that cyanamide could serve as a carbon nanotube precursor [12], and the tip-growth mechanism could also be seen in other studies [13,14]. Raman spectra of Co-CN-T catalysts are given in Fig. 1d. Apparently, all samples present typical G band (1577 cm−1) and D band (1350 cm−1). The ID/IG ratios for Co-CN-600, Co-CN-700, Co-CN-800, and Co-CN-900 are similar with an average value of 0.71, indicating a higher graphitization degree than that of Co-CN-500. It is well known that a high graphitization degree could boost the charge transfer process, thus improving the ORR activity [15]. XPS was conducted to investigate the surface composition of the Co-CN-T catalysts. As Fig. 2 displays, XPS spectra for Co-CN-500 and other Co-CN-Ts are different. For Co-CN-500, The N 1s peaks could be deconvoluted into three different kinds of nitrogen species (oxidized-N at 403.6 eV, graphitic-N at 400.8 eV and pyrrolic-N at 400.0 eV). While for Co-CN-600 to Co-CN-900, N 1s can be deconvoluted into pyridinic-N (398.4 eV), graphitic-N (400.8 eV) and oxidized-N (403.6 eV), where pyridinic-N and graphitic-N take the most substantial proportion (Table S1). Previous reports have proven the critical role of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N during oxygen reduction process [16,17]. Fig. S3 shows the XRD results of the Co-CN-T catalysts. The broad diffraction peak at around 2θ = 26.5° is ascribed to the crystalline facet (002) of graphitic carbon, and the peaks centered at 2θ = 44.4°,51.5°, and 75.8° are in line with the JCPDS card 15–0806, signifying the presence of metallic cobalt. Fig. S4 displays the SBET of the catalysts, all the as-prepared catalysts exhibit well-defined hysteresis loops at the range from 0.4–1.0 P/P0, denoting the existence of mesoporous structure. For CV measurement, there is no observable cathodic reduction peak in the N2-saturated electrolyte, while in the O2-saturated electrolyte, a well-defined redox peak appears near 0.72 V, corresponding to the ORR process (fig. S5). The polarization curves of the catalysts tested under 1600 rpm are presented in Fig. 3a. Apparently, catalysts calcined at 600–900 °C present similar ORR activity, while Co-CN-500 sharply decreases in ORR behavior. According to the FESEM results, the structure and morphology of Co-CN-T (T = 600–800 °C) are different. However, they exhibit similar ORR performance. This phenomenon is due to several reasons: (1) The Co-CN-Ts (T = 600–900 °C) have the similar ID/IG ratios of 0.71; (2) they have similarly abundant pyridinic-N and graphitic-N on the surface. That is to say, the structures have no noticeable effect on the ORR performance over Co-CN-T catalysts, but the ORR activity is closely associated with the N species on the surface and high graphitization degree. The half-wave potential for Co-CN-600, 700, 800, 900 and Pt/C are 0.796, 0.788, 0.793, 0.789 and 0.831 V, respectively. Plainly, Co-CN-600 falls merely 35 mV lower than Pt/C. Tafel plots stemmed from the LSV results under 1600 rpm are presented in Fig. 3b, the Tafel slopes of Co-CN-600, 700, 800, 900 are 48, 40, 54 and 45 mV/decades, respectively, all of them are smaller than that of Pt/C (72 mV/decades), implying that the Co-CN-T catalysts possess better kinetic performance in oxygen reduction process. The corresponding K-L plots under varied potentials were utilized to estimate the electron transfer numbers per O2 molecule. The K-L plots of Co-CN-600 to Co-CN-900 catalysts show good linearity, and the slopes maintain almost the same at the range between 0.2 V and 0.6 V (fig. S6-S10), with n values average 3.99, 3.55, 4.02 and 4.12, respectively, approaching to that of Pt/C (3.90). The high and stable transfer numbers could be confirmed by RRDE measurement, from which the n values were calculated to be 3.73 on average (Table S2), and the oxygen reduction process on all catalysts yields less than 16% of H2O2. Besides, Co-CN-600 exhibits remarkable long-term stability with 99.9% current retention after 12 h of i-t-test (fig. S11a), where Pt/C lost 22% of its initial activity, indicating that the stability of the active sites on Co-CN-Ts is superior to those on the Pt/C. The methanol resistance is another factor in practical applications. When 25 ml methanol was injected into the electrolyte, the current of Co-CN-600 experienced a slight shake and quickly returned to be steady, whereas the Pt/C suffered a sharp decrease (fig. S11b). 4 Conclusions In summary, an effective non-precious electrocatalyst for ORR was synthesized by calcining a single precursor. The facile one-pot synthesis only requires low-cost materials and suffers no hazard. Though the as-synthesized catalysts calcined at varied temperatures show different structures, they nearly possess the same activity for ORR and selectivity for the four-electron path. The high performance of Co-CN-Ts should be ascribed to the abundant pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen on the surface, as well as high graphitization degree. Along with their superb stability and outstanding methanol resistance, we would expect that Co-CN-Ts could be promising ORR catalysts for practical application.

Among them, transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are considered as the most promising candidates. Here, a novel Co-N-C catalyst was prepared via a simple one-pot method, Co(HNCN)2 was utilized as a single precursor to provide carbon, nitrogen and cobalt source. The as-prepared Co-CN-600 exhibited a half-wave potential of 0.796 V, close to that of commercial Pt/C, the four-electron path was confirmed by Koutecky-Levich equations and RRDE test. In addition, Co-CN-600 possessed better long-term stability and stronger methanol tolerance than Pt/C.",
