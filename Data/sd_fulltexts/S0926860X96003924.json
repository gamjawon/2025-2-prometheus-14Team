The influence of the phosphorus concentration and the preparation procedure on the structure and the dispersion of the compounds formed in the oxide form of the catalysts was studied. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for the characterization of the catalysts. It was demonstrated that introduction of phosphorus in NiW/AI203 catalysts impedes the formation of NiAI204 and increases the amount of Ni2+(Oh) ions in the oxide form of the samples. This effect of phosphorus is better expressed when phosphorus is first introduced to alumina, followed by co-impregnation with nickel and tungsten. Surface AIPO4 is formed in the phosphorus containing samples irrespective of the preparation procedure. Phosphorus is distributed as a monolayer up to concentrations of 1.3 P at/nm2 in both series of catalysts. It was also found that the increased phosphorus content in the samples leads to an increased degree of polymerization of the tungsten species via W-O-W bonds. The presence of phosphorus changes the dispersion of the active components. Evaluation of the average particle size of tungsten species shows that it increases from 10 ]~ for the phosphorus free sample up to 20-25 ,~ for the samples with high phosphorus content. The relationship between the structure of the phosphorus promoted NiW/AI203 catalysts and their hydrodesulfurization activity is discussed. ~, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Introduction of phosphorus in promoted and non- promoted molybdenum-based hydrotreating catalysts was shown to influence their hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrogena- tion (HYD) activity, depending on phosphorus con- 0926-860X/97/$17.00 (~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Atanasova et aL/Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 105-119 centration, the preparation method, the model com- pound and the reaction conditions [1-12]. Different conclusions regarding the promoting role of phos- phorus on the HDS activity were suggested: the for- mation of the inactive nickel aluminate phase impeded by the phosphorus interaction with the alumina sup- port [2]; improved dispersion of the active phases [3,5,7]; increased stacking of MoS2 and change in the morphology of the active species [4,6,9]; direct participation of phosphorus in the active phase [8,10]. In some cases promoting effect of phosphorus on the HDS activity of molybdenum-based alumina-sup- ported catalysts was observed ]3,4,7], while practi- cally no effect of phosphorus or even a negative effect was found in other studies [6,9]. It has been also suggested that phosphorus has a direct role in the HDN reaction due to the formation of new active sites associated with the acidic surface A1PO4 species [6] and significant promoting effect of phosphorus on the activity of NiMo/A1203 in HDN of quinoline [6,11], aniline [11] and pyridine [8] was observed. In other studies, a negative effect of phosphorus on the HDN of quinoline [9] and piperidine and pyridine [11] has been found and assigned to differences in the reaction pathway corresponding to the molecule used as a model compound for the HDN reaction [11]. Contrary to molybdenum-based catalysts [ [1-12], and references therein] the effect of the phosphorus concentration on the HDS, HDN and HYD activity of tungsten-based alumina-supported catalysts has been analyzed in a very limited number of studies [ 13-16]. Investigation of the structure and activity of co- impregnated P-W/A1203 catalysts showed that both HDS and HDN activities were notably enhanced by increasing the phosphorus content [14]. A study of a series of co-impregnated P-Ni-W/A1203 catalysts with low tungsten content showed that phosphorus has a promoting effect on the activity of naphthalene HYD [ 16]. The promoting effect of phosphorus on the HDS and HYD activity of Ni-W/A1203 catalysts was reported recently, also depending on the preparation method-the step impregnated (phosphorus first) cata- lysts manifested higher activity than the co-impreg- nated ones [15]. The driving force for the interest in Ni-W/A1203 catalysts is also due to their potential application for upgrading coal-derived liquids as they show much higher HDN and HYD activities compared to Ni- Mo/A1203 and Co-Mo/A1203 catalysts [17]. Having in mind the similarities in the structure of Mo- and W-based catalysts and the extended knowledge for the promoting effect of phosphorus on HDS, HDN and HYD activity for Mo-based catalysts, it was justifiable to investigate systematically the influence of the phosphorus concentration and of the preparation method on the structure of Ni-W/A1203 system. The structure of the oxide and sulfided forms of Ni-W/AI203 catalysts has been analyzed by different experimental techniques and conclusions have been made about the relationship between the composition, preparation conditions, sulfidation procedure and the structure and activity of these catalysts in different reactions [ 18-27]. In a previous paper on the structure of the oxide form of a series of phosphorus-containing NiW/A1203 samples with low tungsten concentration, prepared by co-impregnation, we reported that the distribution of both Ni and W is inhomogeneous, strongly influenced by the presence of phosphorus, and that the increase of phosphorus concentration stimulates the formation of a NiWO4 phase [13], The HDS activity of these samples was not influenced by the presence of phosphorus except for the sample with the highest phosphorus content, for which the activity decreases [28]. This result suggested that promoting effect of phosphorus on HDS can not be achieved in catalysts where it stimulates formation of species with poor dispersion and not sulfidable at the conventionally used temperatures of sulfidation (crystalline NiWO4, for example). It has been reported in several papers on phosphorus containing Mo/A1203 [4,29] and Co(Ni)-Mo/A1203 [5,7] catalysts that the preparation method (especially the sequence of the introduction of phosphorus, simul- taneously or by step impregnation) is important for the structure and the activity of the samples. It has been suggested recently for P-Mo/A1203 catalysts that uni- form Mo dispersion can be achieved either by co- impregnation with phosphorus at low pH or by sequential (after phosphorus) impregnation at pH higher than the isoelectric point of the support [30]. However, when it comes to more complicated Ni- promoted catalysts, the co-impregnation of phos- phorus, nickel and tungsten at pH=l resulted in catalysts with poor dispersion of the active compo- nents and formation of separate crystalline phases - NiO, WO3 [13]. Therefore, the effect of the prepara- P. Atanasova et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 105-119 107 tion method on the structure of P-Ni-W/A1203 catalysts needs to be investigated in more detail. The aim of the present paper is to examine both the effect of the method of preparation and of the phos- phorus concentration on the dispersion of nickel and tungsten and on the type of structures formed in the oxide form of two series of phosphorus-containing NiW/A1203 catalysts. The samples were studied by UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The relation between the struc- ture of the oxide form and the catalytic activity of these catalysts in HDS of thiophene is also discussed. 2. Experimental 2. I. Preparation and composition of the samples The samples were obtained by multiple step impregnation according to moisture capacity of the ~/-A1203 support, precalcined at 873 K (specific sur- face area 266 m2g 1, pore volume 0.62 cm3g-1 and average pore radius of 4.6 nm). Details on the alumina support preparation are given elsewhere [3]. The term 'multiple step impregnation' means that the total amount of the W, Ni and P content (for the co- impregnated series) was introduced by four impreg- nation steps, in each of them with solution equal to the moisture capacity of the support, followed by inter- mediate drying of the catalysts at 373 K. The con- centration of (NH4)6 H2W12040 and Ni(NO3)~ in the impregnation solution was 104.4 g/1 and 47.75 g/l respectively. In the case of step-impregnated catalysts the whole amount of phosphorus was introduced at once in the first impregnation step, followed by drying and calcination, and by four co-impregnation steps with W and Ni. The details of the preparation proce- dures were as follows: l. W/AI203 and NiW/AI203 samples: prepared by four impregnation steps with (NH4)6 H2WIzO4o or respectively (NH4)6 H2WI2040 and Ni(NO3)2.6 H20 (co-impregnated) solutions. The samples were dried after each impregnation step at 373 K for 1 h and finally calcined at 823 K for 2 h. The impregna- tion solution was adjusted to pH 4.0 by HNO3. 2. NiWP(x)/A1203 samples: prepared by four co- impregnation steps with solutions of (NH4)6 H2WI2040, Ni(NO3)2.6 H20 and H3PO4. After each impregnation step the samples were dried at 373 K for l h and finally calcined at 823 K for 2 h. The impregnation solution was adjusted to pH 4.0 by ammonia solution. 3. NiW-P(x)/AI203 samples: prepared by initial impregnation of the support with H3PO4 solution at pH 2.0. Then the samples were dried at 373 K for 1 h and calcined at 823 K for 2 h. This was followed by four co-impregnation steps with a solution of (NH4)6 HzW12040 and Ni(NO3)2.6 H20 at pH 4.0 and the same procedure of inter- mediate drying at 373 K for 1 h and final calcina- tion at 823 K for 2 h.

The series where all components were introduced simultaneously are denoted -NiWP(x) and the series where phosphorus was introduced first -NiW-P(x); in both cases (x) denotes the wt.% of P205. 2.2. Catalysts characterization The specific surface area of the samples was mea- sured by the BET method (nitrogen adsorption at 77 K) on an ASAP 2000 apparatus (Micromeritics). XRD diffraction patterns were obtained on a Phillips diffractometer using nickel-filtered CUK~ radiation. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Beckman 5270 UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory with an integrating sphere. Spectra were recorded in the 250 -2200 nm range using barium sulfate as refer- ence. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicko- let ZDX FTIR spectrometer using potassium bromide pellets. Compensation of alumina absorption was used in the 1000-400cm-1 range by subtraction of a normalized spectrum of an equivalent amount of carrier from the spectra of the samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB-MKII (VG Scientific) spectrometer, working in AE = constant mode at a pass energy of 50 eV, using an aluminium anode (A1K,~ 1486.7 eV, 250 W). The residual pressure in the ana- lysis chamber was 6.10-8 tort (1 torr =133.3 Pa). The samples were pressed into pellets in metal holders and all conditions of samples preparation, recording of the spectra and data processing were identical for all samples. The peak positions are relative to the binding energy of AI 2p =74.5 eV. The experimental relative intensities used in comparison to the theoretically cal- culated ones are evaluated after normalization of the peak areas for the number of scans, time per channel, scan width and number of channels. The peak area of Ni 2p3/2 includes the area of the satellite peak. 2.3. HDS activity test The HDS activity of the samples was determined in a glass flow tube reactor at a temperature of 623 K and atmospheric pressure using thiophene as model com- pound. The catalysts samples (0.5 g, particle size 0.2- 0.4 mm) were presulfided in situ with a flow of H2S/H2 (1 : 10) mixture for 2 h at 623 K. Catalytic activity measurements were performed using a reaction mix- ture of H2/thiophene gas ratio of 34 : 1. The analysis of the reaction products was made using a gas chro- matograph connected to the reactor via a six-way valve. Samples were taken after reaching a steady state composition of the mixture at the reactor outlet. The reaction products detected for all catalysts were butane, 1-butene, and cis/trans-2-butenes plus H2S and unreacted thiophene. The hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalysts was expressed as thiophene conversion in mol %. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Surface areas The change of the SBET surface area vs. the phos- phorus content of the samples is shown in Fig. 1. A linear decrease (about 3 m2.g-1 per wt.% P205) is observed for the NiWP(x) series, obtained by co- impregnation. For the NiW-P(x) series the decrease of the SBET is steeper, about 6 mZ.g-1 per wt.% P205 and even higher for the samples with low phosphorus content.

The different slopes of the curves are probably related to the preparation procedure. In the initial impregnation of NiW-P(x) samples the pH of the H3PO4 was 2, which may increase the corrosive action of the acid medium on the support. In the co-impregnated NiWP(x) series, pH of the impregnation solution is higher (pH 4), less phosphorus is in contact with the alumina surface at the first impregnation step and the blocking effect of phosphorus is less strongly expressed. 3.2. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) Table 2 contains the data on the DRS band positions (nm) of the samples in their oxide form. Fig. 2 shows the spectra in the form of Kubelka-Munk function F(Rcx~) 119,31 ] of the NiWP(x) series in Fig. 2(a) and of the NiW-P(x) series in Fig. 2(b) in the 900-400 nm interval. The bands at 620 and 580(sh) nm [(sh) is abbrevia- tion for shoulder] in the DRS spectra of the phos- phorus free NiW sample indicate the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated Ni2+ ions in NiAIzOa [13,19,32]. The bands at 410,460(sh),680 (sh) and 730 nm are related to octahedrally coordinated Ni2+ ions and probably reflect the presence of surface compounds of Ni where both AI-O and W-O ligands are present in the coordination sphere of the Niz+(Oh) ions [19,32]. In the DRS spectra of the phosphorus containing NiWP(x) samples (Fig. 2a), the band at 460 nm is not observed but the other bands have almost the same positions. The increased phosphorus concentration in the co-impregnated series mainly changes the position of the band of the 3A2g ~ 3Tlg transition. A clear tendency for this shift is observed: from 420 nm for NiWP(1) to 400 nm for NiWP(7.2). This could be a result of the formation of W-O-P or Ni-O-P bonds which leads to changes in the local surrounding of the Ni2+(Oh) ions. Introduction of phosphorus in the first impregnation step (Fig. 2b) decreases the intensity of the bands at 630 and 590 nm corresponding to Ni2+ ions in tetra- hedral coordination. For the samples with phosphorus content above 3 wt.% P205 these bands are not observed at all, while the bands at 750, 800 nm become predominant. Contrary to the co-impregnated samples, for step- impregnated series the band at 420 nm is shifted to 430 nm with the increase of the phosphorus content. A similar shift to higher wavelengths is also observed for the band at 750nm (sample NiW-P(1)) to 800nm (sample NiW-P(7.6)). This shift of the adsorption to longer wavelengths reflects the presence of more W atoms in the second coordination sphere of Ni2+ ions as sug- gested by Scheffer et al. [19] and is in agreement with our previous results about phosphorus induced forma- tion of NiWO4 phase in the oxide form of P-Ni-W/ A1203 catalysts [13]. 110 P Atanasova et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 105-119 620 /,,o 'r o o,~ o (1 } \" ,,,,';\"\"'~ ;I /kl \"222\"Y > ] I I I I 880 700 600 500 ? : / (1.) 420 I 400 I ~ tnm] 81~0 '\\ i I I 700 6[~0 500 46o i ~[nrn] Fig. 2.

Numbers in parentheses refer to the amount of phosphorus in the samples expressed in wt.% of P205. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the ratios of Kubelka-Munk function values corresponding to the main bands of Niz+(Oh)-410 nm and of Ni2+(Td)- 630 nm on the phosphorus content. For both series a linear increase of this ratio is observed, which indi- cate~ that the introduction of phosphorus changes the ratio Ni(Oh)/Ni(Td) in the catalysts. However, when phosphorus is first introduced to alumina it impedes the inclusion of Ni in the tetrahedral sites much stronger. Thus, as a result of the preparation procedure the samples with high phosphorus content prepared by co-impregnation have less Ni2+(Oh) than the corre- sponding samples where phosphorus has been intro- duced first. The above mentioned results are in accordance with the data on the oxide form of P-Ni-Mo/A1203 catalysts, where similar impeding effect of phosphorus on the formation of NiAI204 has been observed [2,32]. 3.3. Infrared spectra (IR) Fig. 4 shows the IR spectra of the phosphorus containing samples in the 1300-1000 cm-1 region: NiWP(x) series (Fig. 4a) and NiW-P(x) series (Fig. 4b). For all samples a broad band is observed, with a maximum shifted from 1175cm-1 to l145cm-j for NiWP(x) samples and from 1160 cm-t to 1130 cm- 1 for NiW-P(x) samples with the increase of the phosphorus content. The peak position of this band corresponds to the formation of a surface AIPO4 phase [32-35]. The shift to lower wavenum- bers with the increase of phosphorus content probably reflects the formation of polyphosphate structures in P.

Examination of the literature data on IR spectra of different nickel phosphates and of P-W compounds [34,36-40] shows that the bands corresponding to P-O-Ni and P-O-W bridge bonds are situated at 1080-1060 cm L.

Fig. 5 shows the changes of the area of the band centered at about 1145 cm z _ S(IRox) vs. the phos- phorus content. Linear dependence is observed for both series irrespective of the possible presence of different phosphate species in the oxide form of the phosphorus containing samples. The intensity of the band for the NiW-P(x) samples, where phosphorus has been introduced to alumina first, is higher than the one of the corresponding co-impregnated samples. These data and the more strongly expressed blocking effect on the alumina surface (Fig. 1) reflect the formation of more A1PO4 species when phosphorus is being introduced first. Fig. 6 shows the IR spectra of W/AI20~ and NiW/ A1203 samples in the 1000-600 cm- l region. Bands at 963,892, 840, 743 and 692 cm x are observed in the spectrum of the W sample. The presence of Ni prac- tically does not change the peak positions and the spectra of the NiW sample is very similar to that of the W sample. In the structural analysis of different types of tungsten compounds, e.g. tungsten trioxides and tungsten trioxide hydrates [36] and phospho-tungsten heteropoly compounds [37,38,40] the bands in the 1007-912 cm i interval are attributed to a stretching vibration of a W=O terminal bond and these at 893- 665 cm i to the stretching vibrations of W-O-W bridge bonds.

IR spectra of the W/AI203 and NiW/A1203 samples in the 1000-600 cm 1 region. samples have very similar band positions as the NiW sample. The main difference can be seen in the 800- 600 cm-~ region where the band at 730 cm-~ for the low phosphorus content samples (Fig. 7a and b) is shifted to 715 cm-~ and the relative intensity of the band increases for the samples with high phosphorus content. The relative intensities of the other bands assigned to W-O-W bonds at 890 and 830 cm-] also change depending on the phosphorus content. In the spectra of the NiW-P(x) samples a new band appears at 1005 cm-a, for the low phosphorus containing samples as a shoulder and for the samples with high phosphorus content as a separate band. Following the analysis given in [36] the appearance of this band could be related to the presence of shorter W=O bonds in these samples. Fig. 8 shows the variation of the relative intensities of the bands corresponding to W=O and to W-O-W bonds: 1(950 cm-l)/I(880 cm-1) (Fig. 8a) and I(950 cm-1)/I(730 cm-r) (Fig. 8b). The relative intensities were estimated as a ratio of the peak heights. In order to verify if the changes of the relative intensities were not due to an artefact connected with the overlapping of the bands we use both bands at 880 and 730 cm T, attributed to the vibrations of W-O-W bonds. The curves for both relations are similar and indicate a non-linear dependence vs. the phosphorus content. Ouafi et al. [20] pointed out that in the presence of Ni the intensity of the band at 980 cm-~ assigned to the W=O bonds decreases, which indicates that nickel favors the formation of polytungstate species. The same change can be also observed in the spectra of the NiW sample compared to that of the W sample (Fig. 6). The results shown on Fig. 8 provide an indication that the presence of phosphorus also has an influence on the relation W=O/W-O-W, e.g. on the formation of polytungstate species. Maximum of the curves is observed at 2 wt.% P205 for the NiW-P(x) series. Above this concentration a decrease of the relation W=O/W-O-W bonds is observed which indi- cates an increased polymerization of tungsten in the samples with high phosphorus content. For all co- impregnated NiWP(x) samples the ratio W=O/W-O-W is smaller than that of the NiW sample and a local maximum at a concentration of 3 wt.% P205 is observed. Obviously, the introduction of phosphorus in both series leads to changes in the degree of polymerization of tungsten species in the oxide form of the catalysts. This result is in agreement with the data for the oxide form of P-Ni-Mo/AI203 catalysts, where an increased degree of polymerization has been observed with the increase of phosphorus content in the samples [32]. It should be noted that for all phosphorus concen- trations the curves corresponding to the samples where phosphorus was introduced first lie above the curves of the co-impregnated samples. This fact cannot be given a straightforward explanation, because too many fac- tors might influence the changes in the intensities of the IR bands: formation of different surface species of W; effect of the particle size (which might change the ratio between the terminal vs. bridge W-O bonds); different degree of formation of surface A1POa-like layer (which might be related to the type of bonding between tungsten and the support). 3.4.

Due to the low intensity of these peaks it is difficult to assign them to a particular phase since in the same region are situated the most intensive peaks of WO3 (JCPDS Powder Diffraction File 20-1324, 32-1394, 37-571) and NiWO4 (JCPDS Powder Diffraction File -15-755). This data confirm that catalysts with high dispersion of the active components were obtained by the preparation procedure used, contrary to the samples prepared by co-impregnation at low pH [13], where we observed well defined phases of NiO, WO3 and NiWO4 (although the concentration of tungsten was almost twice lower than that in the present catalysts). 3.5. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) The positions of the XPS peaks of W 4f7/2=36.3 eV, Ni 2p3/2=856.6 eV and P 2p = 134.4 eV are identical for all samples irrespective of the phosphorus content or the method of preparation.

The changes of the XPS relative intensities (P/A1, Ni/A1 and W/A1) and the comparison of the experimental data to the theoretical ones based on the model of Kerkhof and Moulijn [42] allow to obtain reliable information about the distribution of the active components on alumina and their dispersion [13]. In the present analysis of the XPS relative intensities the theoretical curves for monolayer dis- tribution are obtained following the same procedure as in [13].

The solid lines on the figure correspond to the theoretical data based on Kerkhof-Moulijn model for monolayer distribution of the species. Fig. 9 shows the data on the ratio I(P 2p)/I(A12p) of the relative intensities vs. phosphorus concentration in the samples. For both series the experimental points lie on the theoretical curves (theoretical curves are repre- sented by solid lines) for phosphorus concentrations up to 3.10-2 P/A1, while the experimental points for higher phosphorus concentrations lie below the theo- retical curves. The deviation from the theoretical curves is larger for the NiW-P(x) samples with high phosphorus content (Fig. 9b). According to the model these results should be related to the monolayer dis- tribution of phosphorus up to concentration of 3.10 2 P/A1 (1.3 P at/nm2) and for higher concentration to the formation of multilayer phosphorus structures. This 'critical' concentration for the monolayer distribution of phosphorus is in a very good agreement with the results of Cordero et al. and Lewis et al. [44,45] on the formation of polyphosphate surface structures above concentration of 1.0-1.3 P at/nm2 in the P/A1203 system. Monolayer distribution, up to the same I~ A tanasova et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 105-119 115 phosphorus content -1 P at/nm2, was observed for co-impregnated P-Ni-W/A1203 catalysts, prepared by a different preparation procedure and at different concentration of Ni and W [13]. However, as it was previously stated [13] the deviation of the experi- mental points from the theoretical line for high phosphorus containing samples could be also due to the formation of Ni-W species with particle size bigger than AP2p =1.26 nm. Distribution of this Ni-W species on the surface phosphate layer could create an illusion for the formation of multilayer phosphate structures. Fig. 10 shows the dependence of I(Ni 2p3/JI(A12p) relative intensities vs. phosphorus concentration. For both series the curves pass through a maximum for the samples with the lowest phosphorus concentration and gradually decrease with phosphorus content. The relative intensities for all samples of the NiW-P(x) series are higher than the corresponding values of the co-impregnated NiWP(x) catalysts. Obviously, the introduction of phosphorus in the first impregnation step and the formation of more A1PO4 surface species impedes more effectively the incorporation of nickel in the tetrahedral sites of the support, as was also shown by DRS.

Obviously, the content of W and the preparation procedure and especially the pH of the impregnation solution are of significant importance for the type of the formed structures and for the changes induced by the presence of phosphorus in the samples.

For the NiW-P(x) series the curve of the relative intensity I(W 4f)/I(Al 2p) passes through a maximum for the sample with the lowest phosphorus content and decreases with increasing the phosphorus concentration. The surface area of the samples also varies with phosphorus content (Fig. 1) which leads to changes in the t parameter used in the model calcula- tions [13,42], e.g. the form of the theoretical mono- layer lines (represented by solid lines) for both series is very different. According to the model of Kerkhof and Moulijn [42], information on the particle size can be obtained from the comparison between the theoretical and the experimental values. The value for the mean free path ,~W4f (in WO3) =26.3 ,~ experimentally determined by Carlson et al. [46] was used in the estimation of the particle size of the tungsten species. Results on the changes in the particle size diameter d [,~] depending on the phosphorus content are presented in Fig. 12 (a) -NiWP(x) series; (b) -NiW-P(x) series). For the co- impregnated series the average particle size increases linearly from 10 ,~ for the NiW sample to 18 ,~ for the NiWP(7.2) sample. The average particle size of the tungsten species in the low phosphorus content sam- ples of the NiW-P(x) series (Fig. 12b) is practically the same as that of the NiW sample about 8-10 .~, but for the samples with high phosphorus content d [,~] increases rapidly and is 25 ,~ for the NiW-P(7.6) sample. Obviously, the introduction of phosphorus favors the formation of tungsten species with larger particle size in the samples of both series especially at high phosphorus content. However, for the co-impreg- nated series the surface species are of poor crystal- linity and are not XRD detectable even for the samples with the highest phosphorus content. While in the NiW-P(x) samples with high phosphorus concentra- tion the surface species are of better crystallinity, and are XRD detectable. It is necessary to point out that in both series, when the concentration of phosphorus is higher than 3.10-2 P/A1, the particle size of the W species is higher than 12.6 ,~, which is the mean free path for P 2p electrons and this could be the reason for the deviation of the I(P 2p)/I(A1 2p) experimental points from the line of monolayer distribution in Fig. 9.

HDS activity data Fig. 13 shows the HDS activity data of the two series of catalysts expressed as thiophene conversion in mol %, at 623 K reaction temperature. The HDS activity depends on both the phosphorus content and the preparation method. The activity of the step impregnated NiW-P(x) catalysts is higher than the activity of the co-impregnated NiWP(x) catalysts in the whole range of phosphorus concentrations P.

HDS activity of the catalysts vs. phosphorus content - NiWP(x) series (; NiW-P(x) series (A). (Fig. 13). For both series of catalysts a non linear dependence of the HDS activity is observed vs. the phosphorus concentration. At very low phosphorus content the activity decreases and after that increases having a maxima at 3 wt.% P205 for NiWP(x) series and at 2 wt.% P205 for NiW-P(x) series. Further increase in phosphorus concentration leads to a decrease in the HDS activity for both series, the one for the co-impregnated catalysts being significant (from 80 to 30% thiophene conversion). In general, no direct correlation between the struc- ture of the oxide form and the catalytic activity data should be expected for these multicomponent catalyst having in mind their complex structure as well as the significant changes in the structure that occur during the activation and the work of the catalysts. The presence of phosphorus introduces changes, simulta- neously in the dispersion of the active components (XPS data), nickel coordination (DRS data), type of bonding and polymerization of tungsten (IR data) depending on the phosphorus concentration. Each one of these characteristics of the catalysts oxide form has its influence on the structure of the active sulfide phase and therefore no simple correlation of one of them with the activity can be expected. Therefore, only the combined information (XPS, DRS, IR) on the changes in the structure of the oxide form can provide an indication on the precursor properties that are optimal for the formation of the active phase and for the catalytic activity performance. HDS activity measurements indicate that the step impregnated NiW-P(x)/A1203 catalysts are more active than the corresponding co-impregnated NiWP(x)/A1203 catalysts (Fig. 13). In their oxide form the step impregnated catalysts present higher surface concentrations of Ni and W as compared to the corresponding samples of the co-impregnated series (Figs. 10 and 11). In addition, especially at high phosphorus concentrations when the difference in the activity is best expressed, it very well correlates with the higher value of the Ni2+(Oh)/Ni2+(Td) ratio as shown by DRS spectra (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the dispersion of Ni and W in low phosphorus content samples from both series is very high and similar regardless of the preparation method (Figs. 10 and 12). Respectively, the maxima of HDS activity curves appear at low phosphorus concentrations at about 3 wt.% P205 for co-impregnated catalysts and at about 2 wt.% P205 for the step impregnated. These findings once again support the suggestion that the promoting effect of phosphorus on the HDS activity could only be observed when the presence of phosphorus induces both inclusion of Ni in octahedral positions and when the formed mixed surface structures have a good dispersion. However, neither the XPS nor the DRS data with their linear dependence on the phosphorus content correlate with the initial drop in the HDS activity at very low phosphorus concentrations (Fig. 13). In this connection, it is important to point out the resem- blance of the curves of the ratio between the intensities of the IR peaks of W--O and of W-O-W bonds (Fig. 8a) and of the HDS activity (Fig. 13). The samples with the highest catalytic activity have a local maximum in the relative number of terminal W=O bonds, both for the step and the co-impregnated series. One could speculate that the precursor species with optimal W=O/W-O-W ratio lead after sulfidation to the type of active sites, where the HDS reaction takes place. The data on the activity in HDS and the consecutive HYD reaction of the same catalysts also show that the employed method of step impregnation (phos- phorus first, followed by co-impregnation with Ni and W, at pH 4) led to W-based catalysts which at phosphorus concentration 2 wt.% P205 have the 118 P. Atanasova et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 161 (1997) 105-119 same HYD and higher HDS activity than a number of commercial Co-Mo/A1203 catalysts, tested at the same conditions [47]. At reaction temperature of 673 K all step impregnated catalysts with phosphorus concentration higher than 2 wt.% P205 had better HDS activity than the phosphorus-free Ni-W/A1203 catalyst [15,47]. And what is more important, was that achieved at lower activation and reaction tem- peratures than that usually applied for W-based cata- lysts [47]. Obviously, the introduction of phosphorus in the first impregnation step inhibited the strong interaction of tungsten with the support and impeded the formation of hardly reducible/sulfidable structures as NiA1204 and AI2(WO4)3 in the oxide form of the catalysts. good dispersion and high hydrodesulfurization activity.

Conclusions The analysis of the structure of the oxide form of two series of P-Ni-W/A1203 catalysts studied by DRS, IR and XPS spectroscopies shows: 1. The introduction of phosphorus in the NiW/A1203 catalysts impedes the formation of NiA1204 and increases the amount of Ni2+(Oh) ions in the oxide form of the samples. This effect of phosphorus is better expressed when phosphorus is first introduced to alumina, followed by co- impregnation with nickel and tungsten. 2. Surface A1PO4 is formed in the phosphorus con- taining samples irrespective of the preparation procedure. Distribution of phosphorus is mono- layer up to concentrations of 1.3 P at/nm2 in both series of P-Ni-W/A1203 catalysts. 3. Increase of phosphorus content in the samples leads to an increased degree of polymerization of tungsten species via W-O-W bonds. 4. The presence of phosphorus changes the dispersion of the active components. Evaluation of the aver- age particle size of the tungsten species by XPS shows that it increases from 10 A for the NiW/ A1203 sample to 20-25 ,~ for the samples with high phosphorus content. The changes in the dispersion caused by the presence of phosphorus depend on the preparation method. 5. The employed methods of preparation of phos- phorus promoted NiW/AI203 catalysts at pH 4 of the impregnation solution leads to catalysts with References [1] D. Chadwick, D.W. Aitchison, R.

Two series of phosphorus containing NiW/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by different preparation methods and varying phosphorus content from 0 to 7.6 wt.% P2O5. The influence of the phosphorus concentration and the preparation procedure on the structure and the dispersion of the compounds formed in the oxide form of the catalysts was studied. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for the characterization of the catalysts. It was demonstrated that introduction of phosphorus in NiW/Al2O3 catalysts impedes the formation of NiAl2O4 and increases the amount of Ni2+(Oh) ions in the oxide form of the samples. This effect of phosphorus is better expressed when phosphorus is first introduced to alumina, followed by co-impregnation with nickel and tungsten. Surface AlPO4 is formed in the phosphorus containing samples irrespective of the preparation procedure. Phosphorus is distributed as a monolayer up to concentrations of 1.3 P at/nm2 in both series of catalysts. It was also found that the increased phosphorus content in the samples leads to an increased degree of polymerization of the tungsten species via WOW bonds. The presence of phosphorus changes the dispersion of the active components. Evaluation of the average particle size of tungsten species shows that it increases from 10Åfor the phosphorus free sample up to 20–25Åfor the samples with high phosphorus content. The relationship between the structure of the phosphorus promoted NiW/Al2O3 catalysts and their hydrodesulfurization activity is discussed.
