Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation on platinum-alumina catalysts Eduardo Choren*, Lina El-Chaar, Jose O. Hernandez, Geomar Arteaga, Arnedo Arteaga and Jorge Sanchez Centro ae Superficies y Catalisis, Facultad O Ingenieria, Universidad del Zulia, ApartaO 15251, Maracaibo 4003 A (Venezuela) (Received July 5, 1991; accepted November 4, 1991) Abstract Ethylene hydrogenation by pulse is used as a probe reaction for the study of cyclopropane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation using platinum on alumina catalyst. It is shown that cyclopropane hydrogenolysis is a non-demanding reaction, because all the irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen atoms which are active for ethylene hydrogenation are also active for cyclopropane hydrogenolysis. The number of surface hydrogen atoms exceeds that of total platinum atoms in the catalyst by a factor of about 2.5; benzene, on the contrary, at room temperature, reacts with only a small fraction of them. A pulse technique is used to study the mechanism of benzene hydrogenation. The results suggest the following mechanistic features: (a) Benzene hydrogenation is a demanding reaction. (b) The ratedetermining step of the reaction is the formation of a o-complex between the benzene ring and a metal atom in the presence of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen. (c) The formation of a 7r-complex cannot be an initial condition for the benzene hydrogenation. (d) Addition of hydrogen to the o-complex is fast and requires hydrogen in the gas phase. Introduction Ethylene hydrogenation has been suggested as a probe reaction to determine a new catalyst property, the Number of Active Hydrogen (NAH), defined in [1, 2]. Applied to Pt/A1203, this number is considered to be more directly related to catalyst reactivity than is the H/Pt calculated from hydrogen chemisorption (HC). In this work, ethylene hydrogenation was used as a probe reaction to study two mechanistically different reactions: cyclopropane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation. The pulse technique was also used to study the mechanism of benzene hydrogenation. It is usually assumed that catalytic benzene hydrogenation is approximately first order in hydrogen and zero order in benzene. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the activation energy and the orders of reaction depend on temperature, pressure and the nature of the metal [3-8]. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Apartado 15129, Maracaibo 4003 A, Estado Zulia, Venezuela. 0304-5l02O2/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 86 Experimental Argon (Linde UHP, > 99.99990), used as carrier gas, was purified by passing through an alumina trap. The alumina trap was dried in situ at 573 K. Hydrogen (Linde UHP, > 99.999%) or H2 produced by an Elhygen generator was used for catalyst treatments and titrations. Ethylene (Linde CP, > 99.5%), ethane (Matheson CP, 99.090) and cyclopropane (Matheson CP, > 99.0ss'o) were used as received. Benzene, (Baker, 99.990, 0.1 ppm thiophene) was dried over sodium. Cyclohexane (Merck, 99.5%a) and propane (Matheson, CP purity) were used only for calibration, without previous purification. A two-stage saturator was used to saturate hydrogen or carrier gas with benzene. The benzene content of each pulse was regulated by the partial pressure of benzene and the size of the sampling loop. The reaction products were trapped and analyzed chromatographically on line. The techniques, materials and symbols not presented in this work can be found in [ 1, 2 ]. Catalysts Catalysts A (0.52% Pt) and B (l.37O Pt) were obtained by impregnation of q-alumina with chloroplatinic acid. The catalysts were dried in air at 380-390 K and bottled. Catalyst 5, 0.47% Pt on A1203, is described in [1, 2]. Results Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis The procedure has been described in [2], but to facilitate understanding the sequence of steps and the notation are repeated in Table 1. Cyclopropane titration of hydrogen and the complementary titration of adsorbed cyclopropane with hydrogen were carried out on catalyst 5 after the Hydrogen Number (HN) determination reported in Table 3 of [2]. Table 2 shows the results obtained by titration with cyclopropane. The results obtained with ethylene are also included for comparison's sake. After the last hydrogen titration ending the ethylene run, the catalyst was re-reduced in flowing hydrogen for 12 h at 670 K. The reactor was cooled in hydrogen to room temperature and swept 10 min with argon. The adsorbed hydrogen present in the sample was then titrated with cyclopropane pulses of 8.25 pmol each to produce 12.18 pmol of propane (PI in Table 2). The scheme of the reaction is: Step 1: HW + c-C3HB --> C3Hs + c-CsH8(., IN The second step was the titration with hydrogen pulses (8.25 N,mol each) of the activated hydrocarbon adsorbed on the Pt: 87 TABLE 1 Sequence of titration and notation' Ptt Total amount of platinum in the sample, Amol Step 1: First titration Hoe)+C2H4--.

Results are in the second row of the lower part 88 of Table 2. HC(CP) is the amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the metal surface, calculated by the difference between the total measured hydrogen, HT(CP), and the propane produced by the hydrogen titration, PZ (Step 2). H/Pt is the quotient of HC(CP) divided by the total platinum content in the sample. HT(CP)/Pz is associated with the number of hydrogen adsorption sites statistically blocked by actively adsorbed cyclopropane, as will be shown below. Benzene hydrogion A set of experiments was carried out with catalysts pretreated to selected states. Those described below are typical. In every case the H/Pt ratio was determined on a separate sample pretreated under identical conditions and following the method of [1, 21 for Pt/A1203 catalysts. Catalyst with clean surface AI. A sample of - 250 mg of catalyst A was treated 15 min in the reactor in a hydrogen stream (30 ml min-1) at 390 K. The temperature was then raised at 10 K min-' to 670 K. After 1 h of reduction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and hydrogen was changed to argon. To desorb the hydrogen retained on its surface the catalyst was subjected to a TPD up to 670 K, then confined overnight in argon atmosphere at room temperature. It was subsequently heated in a carrier gas stream to 670 K and maintained for 0.5 h at this temperature, before cooling to room temperature. This procedure was necessary to ensure surface cleanliness [1, 2]. Four pulses of benzene in argon (2.8 tumol of benzene each) at room temperature were sent to the catalyst. After this, the reactor was heated to 470 K to desorb the adsorbed species. Benzene was the only detected product, showing that benzene auto-hydrogenation does not occur, at least in measurable amounts. The reactor was cooled again to room temperature and two more pulses of benzene were ir;jected to restore benzene loss during heating. Next, 16.5 Amol of hydrogen were injected and the temperature was increased again to desorb the reaction products. No cyclohexane was detected. These reactions can be represented as: 470 K Cr,H6Ca)(RRT) - CcHs<s) 470 K C6Hgca)+Hzca)(RT) --* CsHscM+112(x)+Hca) All. A similar experiment of AI was carried out, except that the reaction temperature was 470 K. Benzene auto-hydrogenation, i.e. cyclohexane formation, was not observed. ATT1. Another fresh sample of catalyst A was subjected to the same cleaning treatment described in experiment AI. The catalyst surface was then saturated with several pulses of benzene in argon at room temperature. Pulses of hydrogen (8.25 p,mol each) were sent on the reactor and the products analyzed. Cyclohexane peaks in the chromatogram appeared only for the second and subsequent hydrogen pulses, as shown in Table 3. Supplementary pulses of benzene maintained a large excess of it - which desorbed slowly 89 TABLE 3 Cyclohexane produced by injection of hydrogen pulses over catalyst saturated in benzene (295 K).

Catalyst B was reduced for 1 h in hydrogen at 670 K, cooled in hydrogen to reaction temperature, and swept with carrier gas. Several pulses of benzene were sent to the reactor at 470 K until no further adsorption of benzene. The analysis showed no cyclohexane. Next, pulses of hydrogen were sent, after which the chromatograms showed only peaks of cyclohexane. The results are shown in Table 4. BII. To verify that the surface hydrogen is not active to complete benzene hydrogenation, the HN value was determined using a sample of catalyst A 90 reduced overnight at 670 K in a hydrogen stream (sample 1, Table 5). In this sample a total of 9.8 Amol of ethane was measured for a HN of 2.7. On another sample (sample 2, Table 5), pretreated identically, benzene pulses were sent at room temperature to ensure a quantity of adsorbed benzene greater than the total platinum content. Next were sent pulses of ethylene, which generated 8.4 umol of ethane. Finally, several pulses of hydrogen were sent to react with the adsorbed ethylene and benzene. Ethane desorbed at room temperature, and cyclohexane was collected after rapid heating to 470 K. BIII. These experiments were carried out at 370 K. Catalyst A diluted with Vycor glass was pretreated under the conditions indicated in Table 6. Pulses of benzene in hydrogen were injected in a hydrogen stream (40 ml min-1). In contrast with ethylene hydrogenation [2], the increase in catalyst reduction time does not modify the catalyst activity for benzene hydrogenation.

Deactivation was not detected. 91 Discussion Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis The agreement between the values of HN and the 2P1/Ptt ratio indicates that all the irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen atoms, which are active for ethylene hydrogenation, are also active for cyclopropane hydrogenolysis. This result confirms the non-demanding character of this reaction [9]. In contrast with linear alkanes, cyclopropane hydrogenolysis occurs at low temperatures. This behaviour may be explained in terms of the singularities of its molecular structure: the angle formed by the carbon atom bonding orbitals is 106 , and that of the H-C-H bonds, 120 [ 10]. These characteristics are closer to sp2 than to spa hybridization, which would correspond to the saturated character of cyclopropane. The greater value of the (HT(CP))/P2 ratio with respect to the HT/E2 ratio for ethylene is clearly an effect of the third carbon atom in the cyclopropane molecule: 3.5112W + c-C3Hg(a) -- C3Hg(g) + 5H(a) This means that one molecule of actively adsorbed cyclopropane statistically blocks five hydrogen adsorption sites. Concerning coke formation as a source of hydrogen, Bond and Sermon [ 11 ] showed that at room temperature this reaction is not relevant. Additionally, the hydrocarbon mass balance shows that less than 10% remains on the catalyst surface, mostly on the support. Benzes hydrogenation There is general agreement that benzene adsorbed on clean supported metal catalysts forms a ar-complex. Experiments AI and All show that benzene does not disproportionate in the conditions of the experiments and that the -7r-complex does not react with gaseous hydrogen, as has been remarked by Volter et al. [4]. With the first pulse of hydrogen, experiment OI (Table 3) reproduces the results of experiments AI and All, but in this case, after analysis of the first pulse products, a second and successive pulses were sent on the catalyst; analysis showed the presence of cyclohexane. This result can be explained, taking into account that a part of the hydrogen of the previous pulse is irreversibly adsorbed on the metal, and desorbing benzene is now readsorbed on surface platinum atoms activated by adsorbed hydrogen. The a-complex thus formed is prepared to react with the following pulse of gaseous hydrogen. Series B of experiments, with the platinum surface covered with hydrogen, show that irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen, essential to initiate the reaction, cannot complete the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. Experiment BI (Table 4) shows that saturation with benzene pulses of a surface precovered with hydrogen does not produce cyclohexane, and that hydrogen from the gas phase is necessary to generate it. These results are confirmed in experiment BII (Table 5). In this experiment, 11.0 tmol of benzene coexisted with 16.8 92 ,u,atoms of adsorbed hydrogen without production of cyclohexane. Adsorbed hydrogen was measured by titration with ethylene pulses, and only after hydrogen injection was cyclohexane detected. 7r- and o- complexes are the known forms of benzene chemisorption on metallic surfaces commonly proposed in the literature [8, 12-19]. In the 7rcomplex, the plane of the ring is `parallel' to the catalyst surface. Garnett and Sollich-Baumgartner [ 17 ] observed that edge-on 7r-complexing is not allowed to occur, due to orbital symmetry and steric hindrance of the aromatic hydrogen atoms. Bowman and Biloen [20] have demonstrated that reduced platinum supported on alumina presents an electron-deficient form, i.e. platinum might be able to act as an electrophilic agent. During the formation of a o- complex, the participating carbon atom will change its hybridization from near-sp' to near-spa, with loss of resonance energy [21, 22]. According to Volter et al. [3], the surface o-complex is not an activated complex but a stable species. Maybe it is a form such as species V of Crawford and Kemball [ 18 ]. The results of van Meerten et al. [ 12 ] strongly suggest that a 7r-complex is not formed on a nickel-silica catalyst precovered with hydrogen: when benzene was added to a clean catalyst, it suffered a decrease in its magnetization. A greater effect was found with hydrogen. When benzene was admitted on a catalyst precovered with hydrogen but without hydrogen in the gas phase, no change in the magnetization occurred. This result is consistent with those of Experiments BII: benzene does not displace hydrogen from the surface and occupies only a small fraction of it. Table 5 shows that this hydrogen is reactive, and its amount is of the same order of that measured without benzene. Comparison of these results with the picture of the first part of experiments BI and BII - the actively adsorbed benzene molecules surrounded by a sea of active hydrogen without completing hydrogenation - strongly suggests that, under the conditions of these experiments, benzene hydrogenation is a two-step reaction: 1st (slow): loss of aromaticity and o -complex formation. 2nd (fast): reaction of the non aromatic complex with hydrogen from the gaseous phase. Or, schematically: Cr,Hs(g) + H-activated Pt(a) - stable a- complex(a) a-complex(a) + H2W ---> cyclohexane To reinforce this hypothesis, four arguments may be added. First, the absence of an isotopic effect in benzene hydrogenation on supported platinum, as determined by van Meerten et at. [23] and for which an explanation has not yet been given, shows that in the rate-determining step, hydrogen can play only a secondary role. Second, the difference of several orders of magnitude between the benzene hydrogenation rate and those of cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene [24]. This condition is incompatible with van Meerten and Coenen's mechanism [5], which assumes steps of hydrogen 93 addition with identical rate constants; and it is also incompatible with the mechanism proposed by Nakano et al. [261, in which the rate-determining step of the reaction is the fixation of the last hydrogen. Third, the mechanism of olefin hydrogenation outlined in [2], which shows that one of the reactants must be in the gas phase for the reaction to occur. And fourth, the similarity between the activation heat value for benzene hydrogenation and the endothermic heat of reaction value for benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexadiene pointed out by Smith [25]. With respect to the results of Table 3, an important fact to note is the lack of cyclohexane from the first pulse of hydrogen. Benzene adsorbed on the clean catalyst surface is not active for hydrogenation. The desorption of benzene from the support is continuous, and after the first pulse of hydrogen, the catalyst surface retains adsorbed hydrogen and may, by readsorption of benzene, generate benzene actively adsorbed. The source of the difference between these results and those of Blanchard and Charcosset [27], who obtained cyclohexane from the first pulse of benzene, is that they used hydrogen as carrier gas. The results of the series A of experiments compel us not to consider the formation of a ,7r-complex as a necessary reaction step. Hydrogen saturation of the catalyst, which should prevent 7r-complex formation (series B of experiments), does not inhibit but initiates the reaction. On the other hand, the reaction does not occur under conditions favorable for the 7r-complex formation. These facts do not agree with the mechanisms proposed by Rooney [281, V61ter [3] and Palazov [15], who postulated the necessity of this Ircomplex. The conclusions of V61ter et al. in [41, about the reactivity of polymethylbenzenes, are not correct. They related the reaction rate constants with the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons on clean catalyst (7r-complex), but at reaction conditions no 7r-complexes are formed, because the surface is saturated with hydrogen. However, the experimental results of V61ter et al. are consistent with the mechanism proposed here: methyl groups lie in the plane of the benzene ring, in consequence they are a steric hindrance to the formation of cr-complexes. The reaction rate constant will decrease with the increasing degree of substitution (Figs. 2 and 5 of [41): benzene :~* krtoluene ~\" kyRylenes ~ krmesttylene which is the sequence found by V61ter et al. Benzene hydrogenation has been considered a non-demanding reaction [6, 8, 29, 30] in the sense that the specific activity of the metal does not depend on the metal surface structure; however very recently, Fortin et al. [31 ] showed evidence against this supposition. Krishnasamy and Balasubramaniam [ 32 ] maintain that the active center for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is a monoatomic ensemble. Aben et al. [331 over Pt/A1203 and van Meerten et al. [ 12 ] over NVSi02 catalyst showed that only a fraction of . the metal surface participates in the reaction, and that a weakly bound form of dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen is active in the reaction. Table 5 shows 94 that unlike the behaviour of ethylene, benzene reacts with only a small part of the active hydrogen present on the surface. In previous papers [ 1, 2 ] we have shown that increasing the reduction time increases the amount of actively adsorbed hydrogen. The consistent pulse conversions in the hydrogen stream, independent of reduction time (Table 6), show that the metal sites active for a- complex formation are totally developed at the begining of the reduction process. Conclusions From the foregoing discussion and results the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis - Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis is a non-demanding reaction. (2) Benzene hydrogenation - The reaction occurs only on a small fraction of the active surface of the catalyst. - The rate-determining step of the reaction is the formation of a a- complex between the benzene ring and a metal atom in the presence of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen. - The formation of a 7r-complex cannot be an initial condition for the benzene hydrogenation. - Addition of hydrogen to the o--complex is fast and requires hydrogen in the gas phase.

Cyclopropane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation on platinum-alumina catalysts Eduardo Choren ∗ Lina El-Chaar José O. Hernández Geomar Arteaga Arnedo Arteaga Jorge Sánchez Centro de Superficies y Catálisis, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad del Zulia, Apartado 15251, Maracaibo 4003 A Venezuela * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Apartado 15129, Maracaibo 4003 A, Estado Zulia, Venezuela. Ethylene hydrogenation by pulse is used as a probe reaction for the study of cyclopropane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation using platinum on alumina catalyst. It is shown that cyclopropane hydrogenolysis is a non-demanding reaction, because all the irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen atoms which are active for ethylene hydrogenation are also active for cyclopropane hydrogenolysis. The number of surface hydrogen atoms exceeds that of total platinum atoms in the catalyst by a factor of about 2.5; benzene, on the contrary, at room temperature, reacts with only a small fraction of them. A pulse technique is used to study the mechanism of benzene hydrogenation. The results suggest the following mechanistic features: (a) Benzene hydrogenation is a demanding reaction. (b) The rate-determining step of the reaction is the formation of a σ-complex between the benzene ring and a metal atom in the presence of irreversibly adsorbed hydrogen. (c) The formation of a π-complex cannot be an initial condition for the benzene hydrogenation. (d) Addition of hydrogen to the σ-complex is fast and requires hydrogen in the gas phase.
