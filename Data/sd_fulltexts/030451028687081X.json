RYZHIKOV, E V MARCHEVSKAYA, 0 A LESIK, S M LOKTEV and V G BERYEZKIN Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow (USS.R) (Received July 18, 1985, accepted December 15, 1985) Summary The composition of the synthesis products obtained from CO, Ha and dimethylamine on a reduced fused magnetite catalyst has been studied. The molecular weight distribution of all the identified product components has been found to adhere to the Schulz-Flory equation. Alkanes have been shown to have a distribution coefficient a. different from that for olefins, alcohols, ketones and dimethylalkylamines (DMAA). A mechanism of the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has been suggested for the production of DMAA and ketones. Introduction To explain the formation of hydrocarbons in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, use was made of carbide and enol mechanisms and of the mech- anism involving CO insertion into a catalyst-hydrogen bond at different times [1, 2]. At present, most researchers tend to consider the Fischer- Tropsch synthesis as a chain process [1-6]. For instance, Henrici-Olive and Olive regard the catalytic transformation of initial gas into products as a process of regular alternating insertion of CO in a carbon-catalyst bond, with subsequent hydrogenation of the acyi intermediate formed [2]. Here, chain initiation is the insertion of CO into a catalyst-H bond; chain propa- gation is a CO insertion into a catalyst-carbon bond with subsequent hy- drogenation of the intermediate formed; and chain termination takes place due to hydrogenolysis of the catalyst-carbon bond or due to (3-elimination of proton. Such views about the mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch syn- thesis made it possible to draw an analogy between synthesis and polymer- ization (polycondensation) processes and to consider, in the end, the poly- methylene chain propagation in the synthesis products of CO and H2 as 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 336 polymerization of the CH; fragment [2,4]. That this analogy is valid follows, in particular, from a satisfactory fit to the well-known, for the polymerization process, Schulz-Flory equation for the molecular weight distribution (a) of hydrocarbons in different variants of the FT synthesis [2, 9] and also (b) of the alcohols [2] and primary alkylamines [8] isolated from the synthesis products. If the aforementioned views about the mechanism of polymethylene chain propagation on a given catalyst hold, the distribution parameter a of the Schulz-Flory equation probably is constant (within experimental error) for other compounds constituting the synthesis products (i.e. a is independent of the class of organic substances to which these compounds belong). Thus, the study of the nature of molecular weight distribution of the complex-in-composition product components is expected to yield new information on the mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. To study the molecular weight distribution process, we used the prod- ucts obtained from CO, H; and dimethylamine on a reduced fused magnetite catalyst. Experimental Synthesis of products from a mixture of CO, H; and dimethylamine was carried out in a continuous reactor with a fixed-bed catalyst. The com- position of the reduced promoted fused magnetite catalyst and the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, H2:CO) were similar to those employed in synthesizing the products from CO, H; and NHa [11]. The content of dimethylamine in the synthesis gas was 1-10%. The anhydrous (liquid at 20 C) portion of the obtained product was investigated. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the synthesis products were studied on a Micromat 412 HRGC (Nordian Instruments Ltd., Finland) in parallel in two fused quartz capillary columns (25 m X 0.32 mm and statically coated with liquid phases SE-30 and OV-1701). The chromatographic analysis was performed by keeping the injector and flame lonization detector at 280 C; the oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 280 C at 10 - 20 C muT1. The column at 280 C was kept in the isothermal regime for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 35 cm s~1, the split ratio being 1:50. First, the artificial model mixtures of known composition (n-hydro- carbons (alkanes and a-olefins) Cg-C^, primary alkanols -4, primary alcohols -014 with dimethylheptylamine), ketones and standard com- ponents of different classes were analyzed. The presence of alkylamines in the synthesis product was additionally confirmed by a comparative analysis of the product prior and post treatment with cation exchanger KY-2-8 (H-form). Employment of two parallel columns with liquid phases of dif- ferent polarity enabled us to reliably and qualitatively identify the synthesis product components. The analysis results showed a relative error of 5 - 7%. 337 The product components were identified also by reaction gas chro- matography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Analysis was carried out on a LKB-2091 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer using the capillary columns of Nordian Instruments Ltd., Finland. The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV and emission current 25 iiA; the temperature of the ionization cham- ber and the molecular separator was 250 C. Using these columns in the chromatographic part did not impair the separation of components. Results and discussion Molecular weight distribution of product components (product I) synthe- sized from CO, HT, and (CHy)^NH From the chromatogram of product I and the mass spectra of the multiplet M shown respectively in Figs. 1 and 2, it is evident that the main synthesis components are alkanes, olefins, alcohols, ketones and normal structure dimethylalkylamines.

The isolated components account for about 85% of the product mass. The molecular weight distributions of the compounds (shown in Fig. 3a) containing a functional group (olefin, alcohol, ketone or DMAA) are found to be satisfactorily described by the Schulz-Flory equation [2, 7] 339 56 69 I. illll 84 M/Z 43 50 58 M/Z 56 CH3<CH,),CH =CH, /o,g/ 70 1 140 M/2 57 50 71 85 142 M/Z 58 (CHsIzNtCH^eCHa /da,/ 44 84 14,3 M/Z 40 60 80 100 120 140 Fig 2 Mass spectra of the multiplet M of the product I. log(mp/P) = logCIn2^ + P log a (1) where P is the number of carbon atoms in the substrate molecule. Moreover, these are characterized by a similar slope of lines with a = 0.66 0.01. A discrepancy is observed between the values of a obtained from the slopes and the intercepts with the ordinate (see Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, for the molecular weight distribution the sums of the values of a thus deter- mined for olefins, alcohols, ketones and DMAA are found to be similar (see Fig. 3b). The alkanes (Fig. 3b) (with a = 0.73 0.01) were unexpectedly found to have an a different from that of the compounds containing functional groups. Such a discrepancy was observed in all the studied samples of the products synthesized from CO, H; and dimethylamine. This can serve as 340 logf 1^-) 100 p (\\ \" lu lw J /i, \\ a) p (b) Fig 3.

Discussions favourable to production of alkanes, unlike other products of the FT synthesis, in a different way are available in [6] and [10]. To us, pathway 2 seems to be more probable. Our predilection is based on the results of mechanistic study of the FT synthesis on a promoted fused iron catalyst, carried out by adding small amounts of CHaDC^OH to the initial gas mixture (CO + H^) [12]. In this study, the molar radio- activity of the alkanes obtained was found to be only about 25% that of corresponding alcohols [12]. Molecular weight distribution of dimethylalkylamines In processing the results of CO hydrogenation before applying the Schulz-Flory equation, use was made of a number of equations and rela- tionships suggested by the authors for predicting structure of the expected product of the FT synthesis or for calculating its molecular weight distribu- tion [1, 13]. Of these, special attention should be given to the relationship suggested by Shuikin et al. [14]: log(yp) = (P - 1) log k + log[(l - k)S^] (2) Here, y? is the number of moles of the product with carbon number (p); k = Vp + i/Vp; and Sinoi is the sum of moles of the functional compounds formed. Most probably, this relationship was first successfully employed by the authors for calculating the molecular weight distribution, not only of hydrocarbons but also of the product alcohols of the FT synthesis, obtained 341 on different catalysts. To us it seemed interesting to apply it to describe the distribution of other functional group-containing compounds obtained in the CO hydrogenation, in particular of dimethylalkylamines. Figure 4 shows chromatograms of DMAAs isolated from the products of several experiments. Figure 5 illustrates the results obtained on processing these Fig 4.

(2), and lists the values computed by the Schulz-Flory equation. According to these data, both equations describe the experiment with almost the same degree of accuracy. Here, the closeness of the values of constants a and k appearing in these equations attract our attention (a. = 0.66 0.01 and k = 0.71 0.01). Thus, both these equations can be used to quantitatively characterize the ability of the catalytic system to propagate the methylene chain when different compounds are formed in the process of CO hydrogenation. When the ratio of two subsequent terms of the homological series (Yp+i/Vp) can be determined with a high degree of accuracy, preference may be given to eqn. (2). Mechanism of the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis The obtamed experimental results enable us to express our views on the mechanism of formation of certain products during CO hydrogenation in the presence of fused iron catalyst. To do so, we shall proceed from concepts developed in [2] and [5] concerning the methylene chain propa- gation mechanism, because (1) the propagation of the carbon chain due to condensation of oxymethylene fragments [1, 4] is less probable, owing to their low concentration on the surface of the fused iron catalyst [5], and (2) the insertion of the | =CH2 fragment into a catalyst-alkyi (acyi, car- boxyl, etc.) bond [6] does not correlate with the relationships established in synthesizing alcohols from mixtures of CO, H^ and acetylene, nor with the structures of the alcohols obtained (in the unsaturated alcohols isolated from the reaction mixture, the multiple bond and the hydroxyl group were at opposite ends of the molecule [5]). Mechanism of alkylamine formation Earlier, the formation of alkylamines was suggested by a modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from CO, H; and ammonia as a process that would be competitive with the CO insertion into a catalyst-alkyi bond [8]. 0 C R FT synthesis products H + RNH; -R The reasons given by Henrici-Olive and Olive [8] in favour of the indicated mechanism are, to our mind, either unconvincing or incongruent with the available literature data in the following: (1) Amination of alcohols with ammonia in the presence of fused magnetite catalysts proceeds at high rates between 180 and 250 C, i.e. in the temperature interval in which the FT synthesis is carried out [15]. (2) At large ammonia-to-substrate ratios, the primary amines prevail (up to 95 mol.%) in the interaction products of ammonia and alcohol [15]. (3) The presence of an additional amount of water (the CO hydrogena- tion product) in the reaction zone also encourages the formation of primary amines[16]. 343 (4) Hydroamination of aldehydes and ketones on a fused magnetite catalyst proceeds at rates larger than those of the animation of alcohols [17]. (5) A hydrocarbon (yield 3 - 5%) is the only identified side product of the animation of alcohols and carbonyl compounds [15, 17]. Therefore, based on an analysis of the literature data, alkylamines may be assumed to be produced from mixtures of CO, H; and NH3 by the FT process, and from the alcohols, aldehydes or ketones formed in the CO hydrogenation process. We shall now turn to the proposed scheme of the mechanism of alkyl- amine formation [8]. Suppose that the carbon chain of the FT synthesis products propagates upon insertion of CO into a catalyst-alkyi bond, with subsequent stepwise hydrogenation of the obtained acyi intermediate [2, 7]. Then the competition between the CO and ammonia insertion into a catalyst-alkyi bond is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of acyi intermediate compounds and, hence, causes the yield of all components to decrease. In other words, the relative composition of the non-ammonia part of the synthesis product from CO, H; and NH3 should remain un- changed compared with the product synthesized only from CO and Ha (under identical conditions, of course). This can be verified experimentally. Figure 6 and Table 2 show respectively the chromatogram and the quantitative composition of the product II obtained from CO and H; im- mediately before adding dimethylamine to the initial gas mixture (cf Fig. 1 and Table 1). On comparing these Figures and Tables, it may be concluded that the formation of alkylamines from CO, H; and dimethylamine is ac- companied by a decrease in the fraction of alcohols. Moreover, the total content of alcohols and dimethylalkylamines in the product I almost cor- responds to that of alcohols in the product II. Figure 7a also shows the Fig. 6 Chromatograms of product II synthesized from a mixture of CO and H^ (stat- ically coated liquid phase Oribond SE-30) 344 TABLE 2 Percentage composition of the products synthesized from CO and Hz (product II) P ^CpHy,+, ^CpHy^OH MCpH,p ^pH^O (hydrocarbon) (alcohol) (olefin) (ketone) 34 4 27 8 25 5 900 0.47 6 058 7.39 1 82 079 7 3.21 5.64 1.60 0.70 8 3.40 4.26 1.55 0.47 9 3 26 3.20 1.09 0.36 10 3.03 2.38 081 0 26 11 2.52 1.81 0 55 0.17 12 2.09 1 33 0.34 0.12 13 1 70 1.02 0.31 0.08 14 1.42 0.75 0.29 006 15 1 17 0.55 0 16 16 0.96 0.34 0.22 17 0.79 0.22 008 18 0.62 0.12 0.07 19 0.48 20 034 2 25.57 50.53 8 79 348 \"M = 100 mp molecular weight distribution of separate components of the product II, computed by the Schulz-Flory equation. It is evident from this Figure that all the functional derivatives have a similar slope, and that the value of a agrees in magnitude with that of a. of the product I (Fig. 3a). Thus, the addition of dimethylamine to the interaction zone of CO and H; does not significantly affect the laws governing the methylene chain growth of the compounds containing a functional group. At the same time, for the alkanes present in the product II the value of a is increased (from 0.73 0.01, Fig. 3b, to 0.77 0.01, Fig. 7b). The data in Tables 1 and 2 reveal that the addition of dimethylamine to the synthesis gas (CO + H2) causes the fraction of alkanes to increase at the cost of a decrease in the fraction of alcohols and DMAA. The observed variations in a of the Schulz-Flory equation can therefore be attributed to a relative increase in the fraction of alkanes formed via the same route as the functional derivatives (a = 0.66 + 0.01). Thus, neither the literature nor the experimental data agree with the proposed mechanism for the formation of alkylamines from mixtures of CO,H2andNH3[8],ie.; | -R + NHa -X-\" | -H + RNH, But all these data are consistent with the possibility of obtaining amines at the cost of alcohols formed in the CO hydrogenation. 345 log( 100 P (a) P (b) p Fig 7.

In principle, proceeding from the above-mentioned experimental results, one can picture two possible mechanisms for alkylamine formation in the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on a fused magnetite catalyst. The first mechanism involves two independent steps, i.e. the synthesis of alcohols from CO and tly, and the interaction of these alcohols with an animating agent. Here, it should be recalled that animation of alcohols on a fused Fe catalyst proceeds via their dehydrogenation up to corresponding surface carbonyl structures (limiting step); this is followed by the addition of ammonia (or amine) and the hydrogenation of the formed surface form of imine with nascent hydrogen [17]. The second mechanism is apparently the most probable, and envisages interaction of the aminating agent directly with the surface molecular OH structure || CH R formed en route to transformation into the end prod- uct alcohol. 0 II -C-R H | -CH-R 1-0 H2 H^O H. OH -CH-R H, (CH3),NH Scheme I. 346 The need to consider the ^ CH R fragment in the mechanism stems a-o from the observed oxygen exchange of CO and C2H50H with HzO18 on a fused magnetite catalyst [18,19]. When this scheme is realized (keeping OH the formation rates of | CH^R and | CH R (the alcohol precursor) constant) addition of the animating agent into the reaction zone, together with the formation of amine, causes the alcohol concentration in the reac- tion volume to decrease*. When a significant amount of carbonyl-containing compounds (alde- hydes, ketones) is present in the CO hydrogenation products, there is every possibility of their participation in the formation of amines by the modified FT synthesis. Ketone formation mechanism As applied to the products obtained in the discussed case, the earlier proposed [2, 7] mechanism for formation of the main products of a FT synthesis should obviously be supplemented with a ketone formation step. The absence of significant amounts of secondary alcohols in the reaction product indicates that ketones cannot be formed by dehydrogenation under our experimental conditions; they can of course be obtained via different routes. To our mind, ketones can appear in the synthesis products: (i) upon insertion of the | =CH2 fragment into a catalyst-acyi bond with subsequent hydrogenation of the formed intermediate to a ketone: 000 II II H II CH; C R y H^C C R ^ CH3 C R //////////////// /////////////// (ii) upon recombination of the acyi and methyl fragments: 0 0 II II CHa C-R > CHa-C-R W////////////// *The possibility of the formation of amines with the participation of surface OH- containing structures was reported in [ 20 ] in discussing the mechanism of synthesis from R^ /OH H\\CH3-CH3 +H, C' + N ^RCH2N(CH3)2 I ^ H^O Fe Fe CO, HaO and (Cr^^NH (or NH3) on an iron-copper catalyst 347 (iii) upon CO insertion into a catalyst-acyi bond with subsequent hydrogenation of the intermediate formed: 0 00 00 ,11 .11 II 2H, 11 H II ^ -C R + CO > 3 -C C-R > I -CH,-C R > CHa-C R a 3 H^O 3 Routes (i) and (ii) are related to the concepts of Hackenbruch [6] concerning the formation of secondary alcohols and ketones. The concepts close to (i) and (11) are available in [21]; these were used in interpreting the mechanism of hydroformylation of olefins to ketones. The formation of 1,2-bifunctional intermediates on heterogeneous catalysts (route (iii)) has not yet been proved. Nevertheless, the formation of ethylene glycol from CO and H; on homogeneous catalysts is well-known [22]. The presently available data do not permit us to give preference to any of these mecha- nisms. Conclusion We hope that the given results, schemes, and the views on the modified Fischer-Tropsch mechanism will prove useful for further development of concepts about its mechanism, including the formation of all the synthesis product components.

Glebov G.A. Kliger T.P. Popova V.E. Shiryaeva V.P. Ryzhikov E.V. Marchevskaya O.A. Lesik S.M. Loktev V.G. Beryezkin Topchiev Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, USSR Academy of Sciences, MoscowU.S.S.R. The composition of the synthesis products obtained from CO, H2 and dimethylamine on a reduced fused magnetite catalyst has been studied. The molecular weight distribution of all the identified product components has been found to adhere to the Schulz-Flory equation. Alkanes have been shown to have a distribution coefficient α different from that for olefins, alcohols, ketones and dimethylalkylamines (DMAA). A mechanism of the modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has been suggested for the production of DMAA and ketones. References 1 H. Storch N. Golumbic R.
