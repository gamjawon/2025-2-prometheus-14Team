Department of Chemistry Fudan University Shanghai 200433 China The [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ complexes are one of the most employed family of photocatalyst. The substituent effect of C^N ligand, specifically 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole (pbo) and 2-arylbenzo[d]thiazole (pbt), on complexes was discussed in this work. For this purpose, a series of Ir(III) complexes (A1∼C9) with differently substituted pbo/pbt ligands were designed, synthesized and characterized. Crystal structures show that A2 and A6 have a C2-symmetric trans-configuration while B8 possesses C1-symmetric cis-isomeric structure. These complexes are highly photoluminescent with quantum yield up to 69% in dilute solution. The maximum emission wavelength span from 485 to 615 nm. The substituent electronic effects on the para-position of phenyl have the greatest impact on the fluorescence properties of the complexes. Electron withdrawing nitro group on the 4-site of phenyl make the greatest red shift in the emission spectra while fluorination leads to blue shifts. The electrochemical measurements were combined with fluorescence data to estimate the excited-state potentials (ESP) of these complexes. Both oxidative and reductive ESP are in a good range compared to the widely applied [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2dtbbpy]PF6, suggesting that they are high-potential in photoredox catalysis. The complexes A1∼C9 were further applied in the deoxygenation-addition synthesis of N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)butanamide to test the catalytic activity. Excellent yields (up to 91%) were obtained with catalyst A2, A8 and B8. Substitution on substrates was also tolerated in a degree.

Excited-state photocatalysts transfer electron to (or capture from) the quenching reagent in reaction system through single electron transfer (SET) process, and usually generate highly reactive radical species [2]. Given that radical reactions are well-understood by former researchers [3–5], the key to enhance a photoredox catalytical process is to search for better catalyst that can catch and convert light energy with higher efficiency. One of the most employed family of photocatalyst is iridium and ruthenium complexes with multiple N-heterocyclic ligands, including Ru(bpy)3 2+ (bpy as 2,2′-bipyridine), fac-Ir(ppy)3 (ppy as 2-phenylpyridine), Ru(bpz)3 2+ (bpz as 2,2′-bipyrazine) and Ir(ppy)2bpy+ [6–8]. The classical trefoil fan-shaped iridium and ruthenium complexes are emphasized by their rigid conjugated ligands [9]. Excited by photons in the visible region, the complexes undergo metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) and rapid intersystem crossing (ISC), producing lowest-energy triplet state (T 1) which is relatively stable and could be involved in either oxidative or reductive quenching [10]. The upper limit of the energy that catalysts import into reaction system is restricted by both the number of triplets generated in photoexcitation, and the energy released when individual triplet state complex turning back to ground state. Given that metal centered t 2g orbital and ligand centered π* orbital hold the pair of spin-parallel single electrons in the triplet-state of iridium photocatalysts, it is obvious that the structure of ligand effects on the properties of the excited states significantly [9]. For the [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ complexes, their photophysical and electrochemical properties could be regulated by modifying the N^N ancillary ligands and C^N cyclometalated ligands [11–14]. The emission energy could be improved by HOMO stabilization of C^N chelating ligands in two main ways. One is to introduce nitrogen atoms on the aromatic rings, and the other is to modify with fluorine containing substituents. The former strategy has been clarified by a series of five-membered nitrogen heterocyclic ligands including 1-aryl-1,2-pyrazoles [15], phenylimidazoles [16], 5-aryl-1,2,4-triazoles [17], aryl-1,2,3-triazoles [18], and 2-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazole (Hptz) [19]. With the number of nitrogen atoms on the hetero ring increases, the emission blue-shifted from 589 nm to 545 nm, and the quantum yields are promoted simultaneously. The latter strategy was validated by fluorinated Hptz ligands, the emission wavelengths of the iridium complex therefrom were shifted to blue-region by ∼100 nm [20]. Since Hptz ligands have nearly reached the limitation of the number of nitrogen atoms on a five-membered ring, and derivation on it have become difficult, more strategies are needed in the exploration on C^N ligands that leads better luminescent property of iridium complexes. By introducing Group 16 atoms onto the heterocycle of ligands, electrons are concentrated onto the hetero ring in cyclometalated ligands. The formed iridium complexes gain even better performances in both quantum yield and emission wave length with azolyl ligands containing an oxygen or sulfur atom (e.g. 2-phenylbenzo[d]thiazole, 2-phenylbenzo[d]oxazole, and 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) [21–35]. For the N, O/S containing hetero ring and rigid conjugated structure it bears, the 2-arylbenzoxazole/2-arylbenzothiazole is a highly potential cyclometalated C^N ligand for luminescent iridium complexes. Electronic effect, spatial effect, and the site of substituents on 2-arylbenzoxazole/benzothiazoles could change their luminescent and catalytic properties. A series of works about construction and derivation of 2-arylbenzazoles including olefination, electrophilic substitution, and halogenation have been done in our group previously [36–39]. On this basis, we designed and synthesized a series of iridium-2-arylbenzoxazolyl/2-arylbenzothiazolyl complexes with different substituents to explore the electronic and spatial effect C^N ligands on photophysical and electrochemical properties, and also the application in photocatalysis. 2 Results and discussions 2.1 Preparation Since the 2-arylbenzoxazolyl/2-arylbenzothiazolyl ligands bear a phenyl- ring and a benzo- ring, the electronic and spatial influences of substituents on both rings need to be investigated correspondingly. We designed a series of 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole and a 2-arylbenzo[d]thiazole as ligands. The benzo[d]oxazolyl was substituted with fluorine, alkyl, while the ortho-, meta- at 5-position, and the para-site of the phenyl were replaced by fluorine, tert‑butyl, trifluoromethyl, and nitro group respectively. According to the methods reported by our group, the substituted 2-phenylbenzo[d]oxazoles (pbo) were obtained from NHC catalyzed oxidation-condensation between 2-aminophenols and arylaldehydes in xylene [37]. From L1 to L4, electron-donating alkyl and electron-withdrawing fluorine were alternately substituted on both rings to provide different combination of electronic effects. More electron-withdrawing groups other than fluorine like trifluoromethyl and nitro were cooperated in L5 and L6. Fluorine substitution on meta- (L7) and ortho-, para-site(L8) were also offered to validate the influence of substitution site. Besides, 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L9: tFpbt) was synthesized by arylation of benzothiazole with corresponding aryl bromides under Pd-Cu catalysis [40]. All of the prepared ligands were simply purified through column chromatography with PE-EA as eluant and determined by NMR spectroscopy (shown in SI). The iridium(III) complexes with L1∼L9 as precursors of C^N ligands (Scheme 1 ) were prepared in following procedure. The obtained 2-arylbenzoxazole/2-arylbenzothiazole ligands were refluxed with IrCl3·nH2O in 2-methoxyethanol/H2O mixed solvent, affording bright-yellow precipitates. After filtration and recrystallization from methanol-acetone solution, bimetallic intermediates [(pbo)2Ir-µ-Cl]2 and [(tFpbt)2Ir-µ-Cl]2 were formed correspondingly. The bimetallic intermediates were further reacted with dtbbpy (4,4′-di‑tert‑butyl‑2,2′-bipyridine) in ethylene glycol under 150 °C, and then added to aqueous NH4PF6 in room temperature to afford [Ir(pbo)2dtbbpy]PF6 (named A1∼A8) in 55%∼97% yield. Replacing dtbbpy with bpy, [Ir(pbo)2bpy]PF6 (B2, B8), and [Ir(tFpbt)2bpy]PF6 (C9) were formed accordingly. All of above iridium(III) complexes were purified by column chromatography with DCM-MeOH(50:1∼25:1) as eluant. Except the nitro-containing complex A6 is orange, all complexes were yellow to yellow-green sparkling powder in solid state. The structures of complexes were then confirmed by 1H, 13C, 19F NMR. For all of the complexes in series A∼C, typical peak-sets of both pbo/tfbpt, and bpy can be observed in 1H NMR spectra, proving that the existence of corresponding ligands. Total numbers of H atoms reduced by one compared to that in ligands L1∼L8 in every complex. The 1H signal of the meta-position of the phenyl group in A1∼A6 split into two, due to the CH activation-cyclometalation. A more complexed cleavage patterns were observed in A7 and B8, which may be related to the cis-trans isomerism in the complexes. For complex A1∼A8, new single peaks appeared between 175∼180 ppm on 13C NMR spectra compared to corresponding ligands, assigning for the Ir-metalated C atoms. These peaks are also reflecting the electronic-insufficiency on the iridium bonded C atoms. The peak-set of dtbbpy are all shifted to lower-field by 1∼4 ppm, showing that the dtbbpy ligand in complexes A∼C are strongly affected by the Ir(III) metal center. Shifts to lower-field can also be seen on the peaks of pbo ligands. In addition, double peaks in 71∼74 ppm in 19F NMR spectra represent the appearance of PF6 - anions in all of the complexes. Proved by the above spectral evidence, the series A∼C of complexes are successfully prepared. 2.2 X-Ray characterization Single crystals that are adequate for X-ray diffraction analysis could be obtained by slow evaporation of DCM solution of complexes in hexane vapor atmosphere. The structures of complexes A2, A6 and B8 are shown in Fig. 1 , the corresponding crystallographic data are listed in Tables S1-S3. Complex A2 crystallized in the monoclinic C2/c space group. The iridium atom was in a distorted octahedral coordination environment. Nitrogen atoms of two pbo ligands are in opposite position (∠N1–Ir–N1′=172.39), and the coordinating carbon atoms are in adjacent to each other [∠C1–Ir–C1′=90.58(14)]. The aryl ring and the benzoxazolyl ring in pbo ligand were almost coplanar (1.40° torsion angle for C1–C6–C7–N1). The lengths of the coordination bonds, including Ir–C(Fmpbo), Ir–N(Fmpbo), and Ir–N(dtbbpy), are in typical range. The complex A6 has a similar coordination structure as A2. Interestingly, one of the nitro groups is not coplanar to the 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole skeleton and holds a torsion of 33.47°(O3′–N3′–C3′–C2′). This conjugation decreasing may significantly affect the light-emitting properties of the complex A6. Both A2 and A6 have C2-symmetric trans-configurations. Correspondingly, in their 1H NMR spectra, all hydrogen atoms are present in multiples of two. It is worth noting that the complex B8 has a C1-symmetric cis-isomeric structure, which is rarely reported in [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ complexes. The N1 atom of one ligand was opposite to C1′ atom of the other ligand, and the N1′ atom of the latter was aligned with N2 atom on bpy. Since the two dFtbpbo ligands in B8 were in different chemical environment, the 1H signals of two dFtbpbo ligands and two pyridyl split into two sets (50:50). 2.3 Photophysical properties All of the synthesized complexes are fluorescent under irradiation of UV light. The color of emission varies from red-orange to blue-green depending on the substituent of ligands. The fluorescence spectra of complexes A1∼C9 were recorded in diluted dichloromethane solution (aeriated) in room temperature. (Fig. 2 , excitation spectra and adsorption spectra are seen in SI). Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) were measured by comparing wavelength integrated intensities of diluted solutions (10–3 M) in DCM with reference to [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 (ΦR = 0.028 in air-equilibrated water) standard [41–43]. Emission wavelengths, absorption wavelengths and photoluminescence quantum yields of complexes were summarized in Table 1 . In skeleton of 2-arylbenzo[d]azole, fluorination at para-site on phenyl generated second emission peaks at 485 and 491 nm (A1 and A2) and shared another peak at 520∼524 nm with alkylated A3 and A4. Either fluorination or alkylation at 5-site of benzo[d]oxazole did little effect on maximum emission wavelength. Only 3∼6 nm red shifts were observed on alkylated A2 and A4. (Fig. 2a) Changing fluorine to stronger electron-withdrawing groups make significant red shifts to the maximum emission peaks by 22 nm (A5, 4-CF3) and 124 nm (A6, 4-NO2). Fluorination at meta-position of phenyl (A7, 3-F) red shifted emission peaks by 19 nm compared to para-fluorinated A2. (Fig. 2b) Additional ortho-fluorine did not change the maximum emission peak, but made a 5 nm blue shift to the second strongest peak (A8). For complexes with bpy as the N^N ligand (B2 and B8), the emissive bands were generally red-shifted by ∼2 nm compared to their dtbbpy counterparts, but the peak corresponding to one at 491 nm of A2 was missing for of B2. (Fig. 2c) The complexes with 4-fluorophenyl (A1, A2, A8 and B2) have better quantum yield (> 60%) as whole. Alkylation rather than fluorination at para-site made the complexes A3 and A4 less emissive. Complex A6 is a dim orange fluorescent complex with the lowest PLQY. We presumed that the three-center five-electron delocalized π system introduced by nitro group weakened the planar conjugation in molecular structure, and destabilized the triplet excited state of complex A6. For such 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole-based iridium complexes, the para-site of phenyl should have the greatest impact on its fluorescent properties, either with electron-withdrawing groups or electron-donating groups. In contrast, the emission wavelength was less sensitive to the substitution on benzo[d]oxazolyl. As seen in the iridium complexes based on other C^N ligands like 2-phenylpyridine, fluorination usually leads to better blue shift, while alkylation makes less. This is stem from the π-donative nature of the fluorine atom to the phenyl [19–23]. 2.4 Electrochemistry and excited-state calculation Since significant difference in luminescence properties were observed, we were further interested in the effect of the pbo substitution on electrochemical properties. For better control over variables, the complexes in series A with the same N^N ligand were chosen for the measurement of electrochemical properties. The redox potentials were studied using cyclic voltammetry in degassed acetonitrile solutions (10–5 M) with TBAPF6 as support electrolyte (0.1 M) and referenced versus Fc/Fc+. The first oxidation and reduction were reversible in the cyclic voltammetry diagrams (Fig. S112). The complexes show a one-electron redox, oxidation potentials E 1/2 o x are between 1.01 and 1.71 V (Table 2 ), and reduction potentials E 1/2 red are between −1.92 and −1.53 V. In an actual photoredox catalytic reaction, iridium complexes often exist in the form of triplet excited states. [5] Their redox capabilities should be evaluated by the excited state potentials (ESP) which are calculated from ground state potentials and the excited-state energy E 0–0 [44]: (1) E 1 / 2 * o x = E 1 / 2 o x − E 0 − 0 (2) E 1 / 2 * r e d = E 1 / 2 r e d + E 0 − 0 As described in the formula, the excited-state energy E 0–0 reflects the energy gap between ground state and all of the available excited state. It can be estimated by finding the crossover point between UV–vis adsorption and photoluminescence band [14]. By this conventional method, the redox capacity of series A in excited-state and their potential of photoredox catalysis can be discussed. The series A complexes have a restricted distribution range of excited-state oxidation potentials (E 1/2* ox )from –0.92 to –1.17 V, which means these complexes have similar abilities to participate in reductive quenching. In contrast, the reductive ESP (E 1/2* red ) are more adjustable by changing the substituents. A1 ([Ir(FFpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6) and A5 ([Ir(tFmpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6) are most oxidative in excited state as expected, followed by A8((Ir(dFtbpbo)2dtbbpy)PF6) with 0.94 V of E 1/2* red . Alkylation at para-site of phenyl weakened the ability to participate oxidative quenching (A3 and A4), compared to fluorination at the same site (A1 and A2). For complex A7 with fluorination on phenyl but at meta-site, its reductive ESP are relatively 0.2 V lower to A2. Nitro group containing A6 has the lowest reductive ESP, implying that its performance may be limited in related photoredox catalysis. 2.5 Photocatalytic deoxygenative acylation Calculated from electrochemical and luminescence properties of series A, the E 1/2* ox and E 1/2* red are close to that of [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+, which is extensively applied in photoredox catalysis. All of the complexes A1∼C9 has similar UV–Visible adsorption bands and compatible quantum yields as the latter. It suggests that the series A should have similar photoredox catalytic ability. We decided to test the catalytic activity of complexes A1∼C9 with an actual synthetic reaction. Zolpidem is one of the most important prescription pharmaceutical products for brief therapy of insomnia. The patent method to synthesize Zolpidem has six steps and with 19% of total yield. Zhu and co-workers proposed a photoredox catalytical pathway to one of its intermediate molecule N, N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)butanamide (3aa) which raised the total yield to 50% and shorten the route to 3 steps [46]. The visible-light mediated synthesis of N, N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)butanamide step was selected for the testing. The reaction mixtures included 0.1 mmol of 4-methylbenzoic acid (1a), 1 equivalent of N, N-dimethylacrylamide (2a), 1.2 equivalent Ph3P, 20 mol% of K2HPO4, and 1 mol% of Ir complex A1∼C9 as photocatalyst, in DCM/H2O (4:1, v/v). The mixtures were then stirred in room temperature and irradiated with 5 W blue LED. After 24 h, the reactions were added by 5 mL of water, extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3), and separated by silica column chromatography. The separation yields were listed in Table 3 . The complexes with different substituent varied greatly in catalytic activity. Complex A1, A8 and B8 as catalysts are comparable to [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2dtbbpy]PF6 (Entry 1, 8, and 10). While A2 made the yield of the intermediate 3aa significantly raised to 91% (Entry 2, compared to 82% in reference method). Complexes A3∼A5, A7, B2 and C9 had low catalytic yield for the reaction (Entry 3–5, 7, 9 and 11). A6 did not give product (Entry 2). Fluorination at para-site generally enhanced the catalytic efficiency of the complexes in series A, while both electron-donating alkyl and other electron-withdrawing groups weakened the performance. Knowing that the photocatalyst A2 had the best catalytic performance in the model reaction, we then select some specific examples with different spatial and electronic effects as substrates to evaluate the catalytic activity in deoxygenation-addition of substituted benzoic acid (1) and terminal olefine (2). (Scheme 2 ) These reactions could proceed smoothly and the yields were moderate to excellent, in which the benzoic acid end had electron-donating methoxy (3bb), tert‑butyl group (3db) and electron-withdrawing chlorine (3cb) and trifluoromethyl (3eb); while the terminal olefin end has two kinds of vinyl pyridine (3ac and 3ad) and acrylate (3ab). The product with methoxy group (3bb) and meta‑chloro (3cb) were synthesized by catalyst A2 for the first time. Under the irradiation of visible light, complex [IrIII] was photoexcited to triplet excited state [*IrIII]. The [*IrIII] then underwent a reductive quench, oxidizing Ph3P to cationic radical Ph3P+· through an SET process. The cationic radical Ph3P+· then seized an oxygen atom from carboxyl anion generated from benzoic acid 1, releasing a stable benzoyl radicle that is capable to conduct addition onto terminal olefine 2 generating a beta-ketone radical intermediate. Finally, the radical intermediate was reduced by [IrII] and protonated to form the ketone product [45]. The key step that photocatalysts involved is the SET process between [*IrIII] and Ph3P. The resulting triphenylphosphine radical cation is the reactive species in the following deoxygenation step. The E 1/2* red of the iridium complexes is an important reference for triplet state oxidizing ability. In series A, A1, A2 and A8 show high catalytic performance, which have high reductive ESP (E 1/2 *red > 0.8 V) and PLQY (> 63%). For A3 ∼ A7 with relatively low catalytic activity, the ESP of A3, A6 and A7 are low (E 1/2* red < 0.68 V), the PLQY of A4 and A5 are a bit small (< 59%). A6 which did not afford product has lowest reductive ESP (0.49 V) and PLQY (13%). In the deoxygenation-addition reactions, the photocatalytic iridium complexes were involved in the conversion of triphenylphosphine into cationic radicals. The oxidation capacity of triplet excited state, and the PLQY dominated the catalytical performance of iridium (III) complexes. 3 Conclusion In this work, we synthesized a series of newly designed luminescent iridium (III) complexes with differently substituted 2-arylbenzoxazolyl/2-arylbenzothiazolyl ligands. The electron-donating alkyl groups and electron-withdrawing fluorine, trifluoromethyl, and nitro group were introduced into the C^N cyclometalated ligand at 5-site of benzo[d]oxazolyl and at ortho-, meta-, and para-position of phenyl. With the highly electron-negative oxygen atom on the ligand skeleton we have also enhanced the totally electron deficiency of the complexes. Through the analysis of the crystal structure, we found that both A2 and A6 are in common trans-configuration, but a rare cis- configuration was observed in B8. All of the complexes A1∼C9 are highly emissive under the excitation of UV light, and the electronic effects and sites of the substituents have a great influence on the optical properties. The complex [Ir(FFpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6 (A1), [Ir(Fmpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6 (A2), and [Ir(dFtbpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6 (A8) whose pbo ligands were substituted with fluorine at the para-site of phenyl show high performance in both excited-state reductive potential and PLQY, while the nitro-containing A6 was less emissive. These iridium (III) complexes all have reversible first-oxidation and reduction. Combining studies of optical and electrochemical properties, we concluded that these complexes are highly potential photoredox catalysts. The photoredox catalytical activities of the complexes were tested by the deoxygenation-addition synthesis of N, N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)butanamide. Among the tested complexes, A2 ([Ir(Fmpbo)2dtbbpy]PF6) showed the best catalytical performance that exceeded the performance of extensively applied [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)]PF6. The complex A2 also showed a good tolerance toward substitution of benzoic acid and terminal olefine in the deoxygenation-addition reaction. The best activities of A2 among series A could be responsible to the adequate reductive potential of triplet excited state and high quantum yield. In general, the introduction of Group 16 atoms on ligand skeleton has broken the numbers limitation of N atoms on 5-membered ring, thus brought up higher electron density on ligand. This could provide new possibilities for the improvement of luminescent and photo catalytical efficiency of corresponding iridium complexes. 4 Experimental section 4.1 General information Preparation of 2-arylbenzoxazole/benzothiazoles used as C^N ligand, and the [L2-Ir-µ-Cl]2 intermediates were according to reported methods. For detail, see supporting information. Synthesis of cyclometalated complexes A1∼C9. Into a 25 mL Schlenk tube, 0.045 mmol of intermediate diiridium complexes were added followed by 0.1 mmol of 4,4′-di‑tert‑butyl‑2,2′-dipyridine (26.8 mg) for series A or 2,2′-dipyridine (15.6 mg) for series B and C. The mixture was dissolved in 3.0 mL of ethylene glycol (3.0 mL) in nitrogen atmosphere and then stirred at 150 ℃ for 18 h. After that, the mixture was added into 30 mL of water, and extracted with petroleum ether (3 × 15 mL) to remove remaining ligand. The aqueous phase was heated under 90 ℃ for 10 min, and added by 5 mL of ammonium hexafluorophosphate solution (160 mg in 5 mL H2O). The resulting yellow precipitate was filtered, dried, and purified on silica gel chromatography using a mixture of DCM/MeOH (50:1∼25:1) to give products A1∼C9. 4.2 Photocatalytic deoxygenative acylation General procedure for deoxygenative acylation. Into a 10 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stir bar was added photocatalyst (1 mol%), 0.2 mmol of aromatic carboxylic acid 1, K2HPO4 (7.0 mg, 20 mol%), and Ph3P (62.9 mg, 1.2 equiv.). The tube was evacuated in vacuo and refilled with N2 for three times. The alkenes 2 (0.3 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) were added with syringe, followed by DCM/H2O (2.0 mL, 4:1 v/v) as solvent. The mixture was then set at the center of a 5 W blue light emitting diode (LED) lamp line coil (d = 12 cm approx.), and then stirred for 24 h at room temperature. After completion, the mixture was quenched with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The solvent of organic layer was removed under vacuo. The crude was purified on silica gel chromatography using a mixture of PE/EA (50:1) to give ketone products 3. 4.3 X-Ray crystallography Single crystal X-ray diffraction data was collected on a Bruker D8 VENTURE-MetalJet diffractometer equipped with a PHOTON II area detector and HELIOS multilayer optics monochromated Ga-K alpha radiation (lambda = 1.34138 Å).

        "dc:description": "The [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ complexes are one of the most employed family of photocatalyst. The substituent effect of C^N ligand, specifically 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole (pbo) and 2-arylbenzo[d]thiazole (pbt), on complexes was discussed in this work. For this purpose, a series of Ir(III) complexes (A1∼C9) with differently substituted pbo/pbt ligands were designed, synthesized and characterized. Crystal structures show that A2 and A6 have a C2-symmetric trans-configuration while B8 possesses C1-symmetric cis-isomeric structure. These complexes are highly photoluminescent with quantum yield up to 69% in dilute solution. The maximum emission wavelength span from 485 to 615 nm. The substituent electronic effects on the para-position of phenyl have the greatest impact on the fluorescence properties of the complexes. Electron withdrawing nitro group on the 4-site of phenyl make the greatest red shift in the emission spectra while fluorination leads to blue shifts. The electrochemical measurements were combined with fluorescence data to estimate the excited-state potentials (ESP) of these complexes. Both oxidative and reductive ESP are in a good range compared to the widely applied [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2dtbbpy]PF6, suggesting that they are high-potential in photoredox catalysis. The complexes A1∼C9 were further applied in the deoxygenation-addition synthesis of N-dimethyl-4-oxo-4-(p-tolyl)butanamide to test the catalytic activity. Excellent yields (up to 91%) were obtained with catalyst A2, A8 and B8. Substitution on substrates was also tolerated in a degree.",
