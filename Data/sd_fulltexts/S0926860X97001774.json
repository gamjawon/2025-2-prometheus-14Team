A conversion to the oxygenates such as methylformate and formic acid of 33.0% was achieved. Keywords: Methane; Selective oxygenation; Hydrogen peroxide; Heteropolyacid 1. Introduction Methane is the most abundant compound in natural gas and its utilization is of great practical interest [1-9]. Recently, various catalysts have been attempted for the selective liquid-phase oxygenation by using various peroxides [10-18] and molecular oxygen in combination with carbon oxides [19-22] and water [23,24]. As for the former two systems, the maximum conversion of methane was less than 8%, still low; the third, Catalytica system consisted of three steps [23,24]. The utilization of H202 for the oxidation of methane is environmentally attractive because it forms only H20 as the by-product. In addition, one-step oxygenation is more interesting from the practical viewpoint. Here, we wish to report an effective one-step oxygenation of methane with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by heteropolyacids. * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experimental The H3+xPVxMOlz-x04O (x=0-3) heteropolyacids (Nippon Inorganic Colour and Chemical) were used as received. The reaction was carried out with an autoclave having a Teflon vessel. The standard procedure was as follows. A specified amount of heteropoly compounds (0.025 mmol) and hydrogen peroxide (10 mmol) were dissolved in 9.0 ml of solvent in the Teflon vessel. Next, this Teflon vessel was quickly attached inside an autoclave. The gas phase above the liquid was removed by evacuation and then the autoclave was pressurized with methane to 50 atm. The autoclave was heated up to 80 in an oil bath for 24 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. Then the gas phase was sampled with the aid of a sampler directly connected to a gas chromatograph with Porapak QS and Molecular Sieve 5A columns. The liquid was sampled with the aid of a gas-tight microsyringe and analyzed on a gas chromatography with Porapak QS and HayeSep DB columns. Con- version was calculated by the following equation: conversion (%)= 100 x (N1 +N2+ 23+N4+N5)/NcH4, where N1-N5 and NCH4 are the concentration in moles of CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CF3COOCH3, CO2 formed, and CH4 introduced, respectively. For NCH4, the solubility of CH4 in each solvent was taken into account. It was confirmed for (CF3CO)20 solvent that the carbon balance was above 95%. The turnover number (TON) was calculated by mol products/mol catalyst. 3. Results and discussion Effects of solvents on the selective oxidation of methane with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by H4PVM011040 catalyst were investigated. Table 1 summarizes the results. In H20 and (CH3)2SO solvents, no reaction proceeded. On the other hand, the selective oxygenation of methane proceeded in CH3CN and (CF3CO)20. Among the solvents used, (CF3CO)20 gave the highest conversion of methane, 33.0%, and the TON reached 260. The conversions and TON reported so forth were Table 1 Effect of solvents at 80a Solvent Conversion (%) TON Yield (mmol) CH3OH HCOOH HCOOCH3 CF3COOCH3 COx (CF3CO)20b 33.0 260 0.04 1.06 2.40 0.39 0.16 CH3CNb 2.3 19 0.06 0.41 0 -- 0 H20 0.0 0 0 0 0 -- 0 (CH3)2SO 0.0 0 0 0 0 -- 0 aReaction time, 24 h, catalyst, H4PVMolIO4o (0.025 mmol). bThe conversions in the blank experiments were 4.6 and 2.0%, respectively. Y Seki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) L47-L51 L49 in the range of 0.03-8 % and 5-513, respectively [ 12,13,15,19-21 ]. Both values are among the highest reported in the literature [ 10,12,13,15,19-21 ]. In (CF3CO)20, methylformate, formic acid, methyltrifluoroacetate, methanol and carbon dioxide were produced, methylformate being the main product. It has been reported that (CF3CO)20 reacts with CH3OH and H202 to form a stable ester, methylformate, and trifluoroperaceticacid, respectively [12]. In addition, among the solvents used, (CF3CO)20 showed the highest solubility of methane. These are the reasons why the highest conversion was obtained in (CF3CO)20. The amount of each product in a H4PVMollO40+(CF3CO)2OWH202 system changed with time. The same products were observed independent of the reaction period; the main products were always methylformate or formic acid within about 24 h. It follows that a maximum yield was obtained after 24 h. After 24 h, the amounts of selective oxygenates decreased while the corresponding amount of carbon dioxide increased, suggesting the progress of the successive oxidation of the oxygenates. Next, the temperature dependence was investigated. Here the reaction time was kept for 24 h. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The amount of each 3 n 0 E 2 E o qD O o.

L50 Y Seki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) L47-L51 product significantly increased with the increase in the reaction temperature from 50 to 80. At 80 the main product was methylformate (selectivity, 74%). The amount of each product decreased by further increase in the reaction temperature to 100. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form dioxygen and water was dominant. This may result in the decrease of the amounts of products. The yields of selective oxygenates for H3+xPgxMolz_x04O catalysts changed with the ratios of 1.3 : 4.6 : 1.0 : 1.0, for x=0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and H4PVMollO40 gave the highest yield. In conclusion, the high yield of oxygenates was achieved for the selective oxidation of methane with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the H4PVMoa1040 catalyst precursor.
