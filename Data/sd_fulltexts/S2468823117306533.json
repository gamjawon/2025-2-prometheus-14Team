Graphical abstract Transition metal oxides are most promising non-platinum catalysts for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in renewable-energy technologies. Among transition metal oxides, Mn oxides are very active for both ORR and OER and can act as a bifunctional catalyst. But due to their poor electronic conductivity, carbon materials are used as supports or mixed with other metal oxides to increase their conductivity that assistances in electrochemical applications. Herein, a highly active mesoporous cubic material consisting of Mn2O3 nanoparticles grown on carbon (Vulcan XC-72 R) as a high performance bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER have been synthesized. The synthesized Mn2O3/C has been characterized by various structural analyses. The Mn2O3/C material exhibits much better ORR activity compared to the commercially available Pt/C and Pd/C in alkaline media. The same material is also active for OER, making it a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the reactions. Consequently, Mn2O3/C is quite stable up to 1000 cycles displaying its better stability. The reaction mechanism follows a 4-electron pathway for ORR. The superior electrocatalytic presentation mainly arises due to the better synergistic coupling effect of carbon and Mn2O3. Keywords Mn2O3/C Electrocatalyst Oxygen reduction Oxygen evolution reactions 1 Introduction The world’s ever-growing energy demand combined with the crisis of natural resources inspired the researchers towards extensive exploration of sustainable and renewable energy sources [1]. To overcome these shortcomings, alternative energy storage and conversion devices such as, metal air batteries, fuel cells and water splitting systems have been widely employed as efficient and clean energy sources [2]. Fuel cells are considered to be superior energy converters capable of converting chemical energy of fuels (e.g. hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, etc.) into electrical energy [3]. Among different types of the existing fuel cells, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have attracted enormous attention owing to its advantages such as low operation temperature, high energy density, high energy conversion efficiency and more eco-friendly and find wide application in transportation, portables and stationary devices [4]. Similarly, a metal-air battery, characterized by an open cell structure also produces and stores energy via a redox reaction between metal and oxygen in air [5]. However, for worldwide commercialization of these applications in terms of cost, efficiency and longevity, high performance oxygen electrodes are needed [6]. One of the most important reactions that take place in the cathode of fuels cells as well as metal air batteries is the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [7,8]. Moreover, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that generates oxygen during water oxidation is also of great interest due to its significance in the energy conversion devices [9,10]. Both the reactions i.e. ORR and OER depends extremely on the catalyst as well as the electrolyte used and proceed via a four electron reaction pathway involving various intermediates and suitable mechanisms [11]. One of the key drawbacks of both the fuel cells and the metal-air batteries, which lead to loss of cell efficiency, is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that takes place at the cathode and anode of these electrochemical devices [12]. Thus, developing desirable nanocatalysts to overcome the sluggish kinetics of ORR and OER is one of the most demanding tasks [13]. In general, state-of-the-art platinum/carbon (Pt/C) catalyst or platinum based materials are considered to be the best catalyst for ORR and OER in both alkaline and acidic medium due to its excellent electrocatalytic activity [14–16]. However, the high cost, scarcity and low durability prevent its extensive commercial applications. Therefore, much effort has been given towards exploration of cost effective, durable and highly abundant alternative electrocatalysts with comparable or even higher catalytic performance than that of platinum-based electrocatalysts [17–19]. Replacing platinum with inexpensive metals, developing metal free electrocatalysts or transition metal oxide – based electrocatalysts are ideal approaches to reduce the cost of the electrocatalysts [20,21]. Transition metal oxide (Metal = Ir, Mn, Fe, Co etc) based electrocatalysts have been emerged as an inexpensive alternatives to precious Pt-based materials with outstanding ORR performance [22,23]. Experimental and theoretical reports have shown that transition metal oxides based electrocatalysts act as very suitable electrode material in various electrochemical devices [24]. Recently, manganese oxides (MnOx) have drawn enormous attention as an appealing ORR catalyst in alkaline medium owing to its high stability, availability, low cost, variable oxidation states and effective catalytic properties [25,26]. Such catalysts with versatile crystallographic structures include MnO, MnO2, Mn2O3, Mn3O4 has the potential to replace the expensive benchmarked Pt/C catalysts [27]. The catalytic activity of these oxides is morphology and stoichiometry dependent [28]. Metal catalysts sometimes undergo agglomeration, dissolution and sintering during fuel cell reactions which results in diminishing catalytic activity and stability [29]. Hence, for proper dispersion and to prevent agglomeration the use of an ideal support is very essential [30]. Carbon-based materials have been widely used as catalyst supports in many reactions such as chemical and enzymatic biomass transformation reactions, fuel cell reactions, metal air batteries etc. due to its high specific surface areas, high chemical resistivity, high porosity, superior mechanical strength, excellent electron conductivity and relative chemical inertness [31,32]. The reason behind wide use of carbon-based materials as catalyst supports is the ease of its fabrication in different physical forms and shape. In case of precious metals (like Pt and Pd), the use of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as supports is more as compared to other carbon-based supports to improve ORR activity and stability [33,34]. Carbon based materials not only act as active supports but also enhances the poor electronic activity of the transition metal oxide − based electrocatalysts [35]. Thus, the combination of transition metals with carbon support turned out to be promising electrocatalysts that could remarkably increases the catalytic activity and durability owing to their synergistic effects [36]. Herein, we have obtained cubic-Mn2O3 nanomaterials supported on Vulcan XC-72 R carbon electrocatalyst via hydrothermal method at 120 °C to investigate its bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards ORR and OER. The synthesized nanoparticle was found to show high electrocatalytic activities, enhanced mass activity and superior stability in alkaline media as compared to the commercially available Pt/C and Pd/C catalyst. Thus the present work highlights an improved strategy for enhancing the catalytic activity of Mn-oxide nanoparticles toward ORR and OER. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials The chemicals used in this work were manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O), urea and Vulcan XC-72 R carbon black.

Vulcan XC-72 R carbon black was obtained from Cabot Corporation. 2.2 Synthesis of Mn2O3/C nanoparticles Typically, 0.647 g of MnCl2·4H2O was dissolved in 40 mL of distilled water. Subsequently, 40 mL of 2.40 g urea was added drop wise to the freshly prepared solution from a burette and stirred for 30 min. The resulting solution is transferred to a 150 mL teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave which was then kept in an oven maintained at a temperature of 120 °C for 6 h. Finally, it was allowed to cool for 15 h then washed, centrifuged with distilled water and with absolute alcohol and dried at 50 °C. The precursor was then calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 4 h. Again Mn2O3/C was prepared by mixing 0.060 g Mn2O3 with Vulcan XC-72 R carbon powder in 20% weight ratio, ground for 30 min in an agate mortar and the mixture was ultrasonicated with ethanol (as a solvent) for 30 min. The mixture was allowed to first air dry and then kept in an oven at a temperature of 50 °C. 2.3 Characterization TGA curve was obtained on a thermal analyser (Model TGA-50, Shimadzu) instrument. The samples were heated from ambient temperature to 600 °C under N2 flow at heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the bulk phases present in the samples. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on D8 FOCUS (BRUKER AXS, GERMANY) instrument. The intensity data were collected over 2θ range of 10−80°. Infra-red spectra were measured in a FTIR spectrophotometer, Model Nicolet Impact I-410. Measurements were performed by pelletizing the samples with KBr in the mid-IR region. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) uses a focused beam of high-energy electrons to generate a variety of signals at the surface of solid specimens. The signals that derive from electron-sample interactions reveal information about the sample including external morphology (texture), chemical composition, and crystalline structure and orientation of materials making up the sample. To study the surface topography, SEM analysis were carried out with JEOL, JSM model 6390 LV scanning electron microscopes, operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The TEM investigations were carried out on TECNAI G2 20 S-TWIN (FEI COMPANY, USA) having resolution of 2.4 Å equipped with a slow scan CCD camera and an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Raman spectroscopy has been extensively employed to discriminate between different structures on oxide surfaces. Raman spectra were collected using 514 nm laser source in a RENISHAW, UK Raman spectrometer under ambient conditions. BET surface area was determined by N2 adsorption-desorption using a Quantachrome instrument (Model: NOVA 1000e). The pore size and pore volume were determined following Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method in the same instrument. The XPS studies were performed using a Thermo K-Alpha XPS equipped with an Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) X-ray source at a pressure < 10−7 Torr and an electron take-off angle (angle between electron emission direction and surface plane) of 90°. A survey scan was performed using pass energy of 200 eV to determine possible contaminants. The binding energies of the samples were charge-corrected with respect to the adventitious carbon (C 1s) peak at 284.6 eV. 2.4 Fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical measurements All the measurements were performed under identical conditions. The working electrode was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of Mn2O3/C in 0.5 mL of ethanol-water and 0.5 mL nafion solution (0.5 wt.%). To get a homogeneous suspension the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then 6 μL was loaded on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 3 mm and dried slowly in N2 atmosphere at 35°C in a vacuum oven to achieve a uniform surface. Finally a Pt/C and Pd/C catlalysts were used as comparison and fabricated exactly as the Mn2O3/C. Electrochemical measurements were performed in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte in a standard three electrode cell at room temperature using an Autolab PGSTAT 204 potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm, Autolab, The Netherlands). The cell consists of a Pt wire counter electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the fabricated working electrode. All the electrochemical tests were carried out in a solution of O2- or N2- saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. A flow of O2 was maintained in order to ensure its continued O2 saturation during the recording of electrochemical measurements over the electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). Using a glassy carbon RDE cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were recorded. The scan rate of CVs and LSVs were kept at 50 mVs−1 and 10 mVs−1, respectively. To confirm the reversibility of the catalyst LSVs were performed at forward and backward currents. The stability experiments were further measured by cycling Mn2O3/C 1000 times. RDE measurements were performed at different rotating rate of 400, 900, 1600, 2500 and 3600 rpm. The overall electron transfer numbers per oxygen molecule involved can be calculated from the slopes of Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation in a typical ORR process. (1) 1 j = = 1 j k + 1 B ω 0.5 (2) B = 0.62 nF (Do2)2/3ν−1/6 Co2 Where j is the current density, jk is the kinetic current density in amperes at a constant potential, ω is the rotating rate of the electrode in rpm and B is the slope which could be obtained from the Koutecky-Levich plots. F is the Faraday constant (96500C mol−1), Do2 is the diffusion co-efficient of O2 in 0.1 M KOH (2.0 × 10−5 cm2s−1), ν is the kinetic viscosity (0.01 cm2 s−1), Co2 is the bulk concentration of O2 (1.2 × 10−6 mol cm−3) and the value of ‘n’ represents the number of transferred electrons transferred per oxygen molecule in the ORR process. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural analysis of Mn2O3/C The Mn2O3/C was characterized by various analytical techniques and the electrochemical measurements were studied. XRD was performed to investigate the phase structure of the synthesized Mn-oxide. Fig. 1 a presents the XRD profiles of Mn2O3/C, standard Mn2O3. In Fig. 1a, diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ = 32.9, 55.1, 23.1, 38.2, 65.7, 49.3 and 45.1° which could be assigned to (222), (440), (211), (400), (622), (431) and (332) reflections, respectively which are in good agreement with the standard Mn2O3/Cubic phase (JCPDS card no. 71-0636) and the most intense peak at 2θ of 32.9° corresponding to the d-spacing of 0.27 nm. The XRD profile of Vulcan XC-72 R carbon powder is presented in Fig. S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material. The phases of Mn2O3/C were further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is a useful non-destructive tool to distinguish between disordered and ordered carbon structures. The typical Raman spectra of Mn2O3/C is shown in Fig. 1b, where the peaks of Raman spectrum of Mn2O3/C at 1356 and 1625 cm−1 can be attributed to D (due to the presence of disorder in sp2-hybridized carbon systems) and G (arises from stretching of CC bond) bands of carbonaceous materials [24,37]. No characteristic peak was observed for Mn2O3. In Fig. 1c the FT-IR spectra of the Mn2O3/C is presented, the Mn2O3 after annealing show two distinct bands in the lower mid-infrared 500–700 cm−1 range originating from the stretching vibrations of the metal-oxygen bond. Two very strong peaks at 565 cm−1 and 669 cm−1observed are characteristics of OB3 (B – Mn3+ in an octahedral site), the band near 3423 cm−1 is attributed to OH stretching due to physisorbed water molecules [38,39]. Fig. 1d presents the TGA curve of Mn-oxide precursor before annealing. From the figure it is observed that a substantial mass loss of ∼ 33% occur in the temperature ranges of ambient temperature to 450 °C. This substantial mass loss may be attributed to the dehydration and dehydroxylation of the sample, decomposition of the organic residues and pyrolysis of counter anions into gases [39]. After 450 °C no major weight loss is observed. Accordingly we have employed 450 °C as optimum temperature for annealing of as synthesized Mn-oxide precursor. The microstructure and morphology of the as-synthesized material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From the SEM images of the as-synthesized Mn-oxide precursor at two different resolutions it is observed that it forms a cube like structure. After the preparation of the carbon supported Mn-oxide i.e, Mn2O3/C the morphology of the material was changed and shows some extent of aggregation and the particles are uniformly anchored on the surface of the carbon (Fig. S2, Electronic Supplementary Material). To further investigate the structure and morphology of the sample TEM analyses of the Mn2O3/C are accomplished. The TEM images confirm the homogeneous distribution of the nanosized Mn2O3 particles on the carbon support (Fig. 2 ). The size and the distribution of the particles were determined and found that most of the particles are of spherical morphology and fall in the range of 6–8 nm (inset of Fig. 2a). The selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms that the mesoporous walls are composed of crystalline Mn2O3/C nanoparticles (inset of Fig. 2b). In the SAED pattern the well-defined cricoid diffraction rings are observed which clearly signify the polycrystallinity of the sample. The HRTEM micrographs exhibits clear lattice fringe as shown in the inset of Fig. 2c, the lattice spacing is found to be 0.27 nm which corresponds to the inter-planner distance of (222) crystalline plane of Mn2O3/C NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was recorded to investigate the chemical bonding states and composition of the synthesized material. From the spectrum the existence of manganese, oxygen can be observed shown in Fig. 3 a, b. As shown in Fig. 3a, two peaks at 641.4 and 653.2 eV are observed in the XP spectra for the Mn 2p of the Mn2O3, corresponding to the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 spin-orbit states of Mn2O3 with a spin energy gap of 11.8 eV which further verifies the presence of Mn2O3 [24,39,40]. Mn is preferentially present in the Mn3+ state on the surface of the catalyst. The O 1 s electron emission is bi-dispersed as shown in Fig. 3b. The peak at 529.6 eV originates from the low-energy electrons of O2− species, whereas the high-energy peak at 531.1 eV arise from OH− species [39,41]. The contributions of other charged oxygen species could be the reason for the broadening of the O2− peak [39] N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm was measured to explore the pore structure of the Mn2O3/C at −196 °C. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the isotherm of the Mn2O3/C displays the typical type-IV with a distinctive H3 hysteresis loop at relative pressure (P/Po) from 0 to 1.0 [41]. The BET surface area of Mn2O3/C was estimated to be 116 m2/g. The mean pore size (inset Fig. 3c) is 3.6 nm for Mn2O3/C composite. The high surface area of the Mn2O3/C is expected to facilitate the molecular transport and oxygen adsorption during ORR/OER process. 3.2 Electrochemical measurements The catalytic activity of the Mn2O3/C nanocomposites and Mn2O3 for ORR was characterized by electrochemical methods. Fig. 4 a,d illustrates the cyclic voltamograms (CV) of the synthesized samples in O2/N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode at a scan rate of 50 mVs−1. As shown in Fig. 4a,d, one obvious ORR characteristic peak centred at −0.25 V and at −0.45 V in the range 0.2–−0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl is observed suggesting the electrochemical reduction of oxygen over Mn2O3/C and Mn2O3. A better reduction peak is observed in O2 saturated KOH solution compared to that of N2 [42]. This suggests enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Mn2O3/C nanocomposites towards ORR in alkaline medium. Further investigation of the electrocatalytic properties of the Mn2O3/C nanocomposites and Mn2O3 towards ORR were performed by rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurements in O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH. Fig. 4b,e shows the LSV curves of the samples at different rotating speed ranging from 400 to 3600. It has been observed that with increase in the rotation speed of the electrode, the current density of ORR also increases which can be attributed to the high diffusion rates at higher rotating speeds [1,2]. The Mn2O3/C displays an onset potential of −0.08 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the LSVs, which is more positive and larger ORR current density compared to Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. However, only Mn2O3 displays an onset potential of −0.20 V which is less positive and shows smaller ORR current density compared to Mn2O3/C and both Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. This demarcates the synergistic influence of Mn2O3 and C in hybrid Mn2O3/C over only Mn2O3. The high electrocatalytic activity relates to the fact that the Mn (III), which is electronically degenerate inclines to unveil higher specific activities towards ORR and OER [40]. Also the longer bond lengths of Mn−O, the effect of using carbon material as a support and the Mn (III) moiety are supposed to contribute to the higher catalytic activity [26,40]. The total number of transferred electron ‘n’ in the ORR process can be calculated from the slope of the K-L plots. The parallel fitting lines and good linearity of the K-L plots at different potentials suggest (Fig. 4c,f) first-order reaction kinetics towards the concentration of dissolved oxygen and similar electron transfer numbers for ORR at different potentials [43]. The average electron transferred for the ORR over Mn2O3/C was calculated to be ≈4.1 from −0.4 to −0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl which is very close to 4.0, whereas it was only ≈1.2 over Mn2O3. The average electron transferred for the ORR at different potentials is shown in Fig. 4g. The electron transferred number (n) obtained from the Koutecky−Levich plots based on the RDE measurements was consistent with RDE result, indicating that the ORR mechanism proceeds mainly through the four electron (4e−) pathway (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− = 4OH−) in case of Mn2O3/C. The cyclic voltammogram of Vulcan XC-72 R carbon powder on glassy carbon electrode in N2 and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, ORR polarization curves at different rotation rates and Koutecky-Levich plots of j−1 vs. ω−1/2 at different potentials are presented in Fig. S3 − S5, Electronic Supplementary Material. This shows that Vulcan XC-72 R carbon powder itself is inferior in its ORR activity. In alkaline solution, O2 is reduced to form OH− by a 4e− process [1]. In addition to ORR, we reviewed the bi-functionality of the Mn2O3/C material by testing the OER performance in 0.1 M KOH solution as well. In the last few years, extensive work have been made to develop proficient electrocatalyst for OER as it is play a dynamic role in several energy conversion and fuel cell applications. Fig. 5 a shows the combined OER-ORR performance of the cubic Mn2O3/C compared with the commercially available (20 wt%) Pt/C and Pd/C in alkaline media (0.1 M KOH) using LSV in the potential booth of 0.2 V to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The Mn2O3/C displayed high current density (3.1 mAcm−2) and earliest onset potential (0.55 V) than that of Pd/C but slightly lower than Pt/C, which signifies the high electrocatalytic activity towards OER. Additionally, in Fig. 5a, the LSV plots for Mn2O3/C, (20 wt%) commercial Pt/C and Pd/C at 1600 rpm is compared from which it can be noted that the synthesized Mn2O3/C catalyst displays more positive ORR onset potential and lower current density compared to that of the (20 wt%) commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. Mn2O3/C shows ORR onset potential of −0.08 V which is much more positive than that of Pd/C (−0.15 V) and Pt/C (−0.11 V). The above results revealed that Mn2O3/C exhibited much higher electrocatalytic activity toward OER and ORR. There are various intermediates that can be form under distinctive ORR conditions which are very difficult to detect, however, ORR tends to follows an associative pathway/mechanism with the formation of superhydroxyl *OOH species which further dissociates to form O and OH by the cleavage of OO bond [42,44]. It can be believed that for Mn2O3/C the dissociation of *OOH, i.e., OO bond dissociation is more positive. Thus, these outcomes propose that Mn2O3/C is an effective bi-functional electrocatalyst toward ORR and OER because of synergistic influence of Mn2O3 and carbon interface and preferentially presence of catalytically active Mn3+ site on the surface. In the meantime the mass specific activities (jm) are calculated for the ORR process at various potentials in the range of −0.40 V and −0.55 V for the Mn2O3/C catalyst together with the available (20 wt%) commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. Fig. 5b shows the plot of mass specific activities of Mn2O3/C, (20 wt%) commercial Pt/C and Pd/C at different potentials. Based upon the calculated value, it should be stated that Mn2O3/C, hold almost two times greater mass activity compared to that of commercial Pd/C and slightly better than the commercial Pt/C. Catalyst stability and durability have been considered as key points to evaluate the catalytic performance of an electrocatalyst and also for practical application. We have performed LSV at 1600 rpm after 1000 reaction cycles to study the stability of the Mn2O3/C catalyst. As it can be seen from Fig. 5c, that the difference of ΔE1/2 with the initial is quite low suggesting the Mn2O3/C catalyst has very high catalytic stability. The above analysis demonstrates that the Mn2O3/C possesses high durability and good recycling stability and can be effectively used as cathode catalyst in alkaline fuel cell. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the superior behaviour of Mn2O3/C electrocatalyst as compared to that of the commercial Pt/C and Pd/C for ORR and OER in alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The synthesized catalyst was structurally and morphologically characterized by a range of techniques. The Mn2O3/C catalyst shows good activity giving ‘n’ value 4.1 as the number of electron transferred. The mass specific activity of Mn2O3/C catalyst is almost two times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C and slightly better than the Pt/C. In addition, the catalyst remains almost stable after 1000 continuous redox cycles confirming an outstanding stability of the catalyst. It is exciting to note that Mn2O3/C displays tunable catalytic activity toward OER in alkaline medium. Thus, the present study signifies an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR as well as OER in alkaline medium with a favourable onset-potential, electron transfer number (≈4.1), high current density and better durability. Thus the synthesized Mn2O3/C as cathode catalyst has great promising applications in alkaline fuel cell.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal oxides are most promising non-platinum catalysts for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in renewable-energy technologies. Among transition metal oxides, Mn oxides are very active for both ORR and OER and can act as a bifunctional catalyst. But due to their poor electronic conductivity, carbon materials are used as supports or mixed with other metal oxides to increase their conductivity that assistances in electrochemical applications. Herein, a highly active mesoporous cubic material consisting of Mn2O3 nanoparticles grown on carbon (Vulcan XC-72 R) as a high performance bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER have been synthesized. The synthesized Mn2O3/C has been characterized by various structural analyses. The Mn2O3/C material exhibits much better ORR activity compared to the commercially available Pt/C and Pd/C in alkaline media. The same material is also active for OER, making it a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the reactions. Consequently, Mn2O3/C is quite stable up to 1000 cycles displaying its better stability. The reaction mechanism follows a 4-electron pathway for ORR. The superior electrocatalytic presentation mainly arises due to the better synergistic coupling effect of carbon and Mn2O3.",
