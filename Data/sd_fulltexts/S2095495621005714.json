Graphical abstract Despite many years of research, resolving fast degradation remains a bottleneck for realizing M–N–C electrocatalysts’ practical applications in electrochemical conversion processes and energy storage devices. Atomically dispersed transition metal (M) and nitrogen (N) co-doped carbon (M–N–C) electrocatalysts hold excellent application potentials for several critical reactions required in electrochemical conversion processes and energy storage devices, including oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction. Despite significant progress achieved in the past few decades, their commercialization is hindered by their fast degradation. This perspective article outlines the historical development of M–N–C electrocatalysts, the current understanding of their active catalytic sites, and crucial degradation mechanisms. We highlight that many methods used to tailor M–N–C electrocatalysts likely cause contradictory effects on activity and stability. More emphasis is needed to address their degradation issues under industry-relevant working conditions. Keywords M–N–C Transition metal Electrocatalyst Degradation 1 M–N–C electrocatalysts for potential energy conversion and storage applications Energy sustainability is essential in human society, especially with impending climate changes, a continuously rising population, and fast-improving living standards in many countries. Developing sustainable energy generation, storage, transport, and utilization techniques to achieve carbon neutrality is now one of the energy chemistry researchers’ most critical tasks. With the rapid production cost reduction of electricity generated from solar or wind sources, a promising path is to use electrochemical conversion processes to convert renewable electricity into chemical fuels, which can be easily transported, stored, and utilized, or store renewable electricity in efficient and cost-effective electrochemical energy storage devices for daily usages. Several chemical reactions are essential for these electrochemical conversion processes and energy storage devices, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in different types of fuel cells and metal-air batteries, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolyzers for hydrogen (H2) production and in metal-air batteries, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolyzers, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Electrocatalysts play critical roles in increasing their reaction rate, selectivity, and efficiency in electricity utilization (i.e., energy efficiency) [1]. Electrocatalysts based on precious metals, such as Pt, IrO2, RuO2, Au, or Ag, have demonstrated the best performance for some of these reactions reported so far [2–10]. However, because of their high cost and scarcity of some elements on the earth, there are strong desires to develop electrocatalysts based on low-cost and earth-abundant elements. Among many potential electrocatalyst candidates, atomically dispersed transition metal (M) and nitrogen (N) co-doped carbon (M–N–C) materials have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for these critical reactions. They have attracted significant research interests over the last few decades because they can offer high atom utilization efficiency (up to 100%), significantly better catalytic activity than many other nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts, and potential tunability in their selectivity by modifying their atomic structures. Despite many years of research, few M–N–C electrocatalysts have been employed in practical applications [11–16]. A bottleneck is their fast degradation under realistic working conditions. Many studies have focused on improving their catalytic activity using strategies that are detrimental to their long-term stability. We feel that this is a critical issue that should be a focus of future research. In this perspective article, we first provide a brief historical account of the research on M–N–C electrocatalysts. Then, we introduce the current understandings of their active catalytic sites. Next, we discuss several of their crucial degradation mechanisms. We further highlight that most methods used to tailor M–N–C electrocatalysts likely cause conflicting effects on activity and degradation. Last, we call for a more balanced approach in developing M–N–C electrocatalysts and putting more emphasis on addressing their degradation so they could be used in more practical applications soon. 2 A brief history of M–N–C electrocatalysts Aerobic organisms in nature rely on enzymes to catalyze O2 reduction, which provides energy to sustain life. Many of these enzymes have heme proteins, consisting of FeN4 as active sites with Fe cation bound at the center of the conjugated base of a porphyrin through four N atoms (Fig. 1 ) [17], similar to active sites in M–N–C electrocatalysts. However, enzymes are unstable in strong acidic or alkaline media or under applied electrical potentials. Immobilizing enzymes on solid surfaces often significantly change their molecular structures and chemical activities. Thus, other than being used in some bio-sensors and bio-fuel cells, they are not often used in energy conversion and storage applications. Some metal chelates, e.g., metal phthalocyanines, also have similar MN4 structures (e.g., cobalt (Co) phthalocyanine shown in Fig. 1). They are synthetic organic materials used as dyes and pigments since the 1930s. Metal chelates have been explored as homogenous/heterogeneous catalysts for various catalytic reactions [18]. Metal phthalocyanine was first tested as an ORR electrocatalyst for fuel cells in 1964 [19]. However, the subsequent studies showed that they are not stable in acidic media and are deemed unsuitable for practical hydrogen fuel cell applications. Studies in the following two decades showed that the thermal treatment of various metal chelates supported on carbon substrates in an inert atmosphere up to 800–900 °C improves their activity and stability [20]. Nevertheless, researchers disagreed on whether atomically dispersed M–N4 remained active catalytic sites after thermal treatments [21,22]. From the 1980s into the 2000s, the thermal treatment of various metal chelates further expanded to more general pyrolysis of mixtures of various transition metal precursors, nitrogen precursors, and carbon substrates. Metal precursors included macrocycles, organometallic compounds (e.g., ferrocene), and simple salts (e.g., sulfate or acetate); N precursors included NH3 gas, small N-containing molecules (e.g., urea, melamine), and N-containing polymeric materials (e.g., polyaniline); carbon substrates include carbon black, active carbon, graphite, and carbon nanomaterials [23,24]. Since the first report on N-doped carbon nanotubes as ORR electrocatalysts in 2009 [25], the studies of M–N–C electrocatalysts became intertwined with those of carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts [26]. The introduction of the concept of single-atom catalysis in 2011 further boosted research interests in M–N–C electrocatalysts in the last decade [27]. Because M–N–C electrocatalysts synthesized by high-temperature pyrolysis methods usually do not have homogeneous structures, researchers have constantly debated the roles of M–N4, metal nanoparticles, metal oxides/carbides/nitrides, heteroatoms, or defects of carbon structures in their catalytic activities. In the last few years, significant efforts have been devoted to synthesizing M–N–C electrocatalysts with better controlled atomic structures to elucidate their structure–property relationship and obtain catalysts with high activity and stability. One research direction is to explore novel precursors with well-defined structures for high-temperature pyrolysis. In 2008, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were first used as a precursor to synthesize porous carbon [28]. Since then, the use of MOFs as precursors has expanded to the synthesis of carbon catalysts and M–N–C electrocatalysts. MOF-derived M–N–C electrocatalysts offer better atomic structural controls, which have led to improved activity, stability, and a better fundamental understanding of different components in M–N–C electrocatalysts [29,30]. The other research direction is the renewed interest in immobilized molecular catalysts as electrocatalysts [31]. For example, organometallic compounds containing well-defined catalytic active sites have been anchored on various high surface area and high conductivity substrates [32–35]. Alternatively, they may be encapsulated by polymers, MOFs, or integrated into covalent organic framework materials to enhance their stability [36–38]. 3 Active catalytic sites in M–N–C electrocatalysts Research on active catalytic sites in M–N–C electrocatalysts has been focused on ORR because of their enormous application potentials in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Much of the gained fundamental knowledge is also transformable to other key reactions. Advanced characterization tools, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, have identified several MN x C y moieties as active sites for ORR [39,40]. For example, in a highly graphitic N-doped carbon matrix, MN4C10 has a metal ion coordinated by four pyridinic N. It occupies a two-carbon-atom defect site within a graphene sheet (Fig. 2 a) [39]. MN2+2C4+4 bridges two phenanthroline groups on armchair edges of two different graphene planes (Fig. 2b) [41]. Alternatively, porphyrinic MN4C12 (Fig. 2c) or MN2+2C12 (Fig. 2d) are more abundant in amorphous carbon matrices derived from MOFs [40]. Researchers have also debated whether the active catalytic sites are located in the graphene planes or at the edge-defects [42,43]. As illustrated in Fig. 2(e), if most active sites are located in the graphene planes, it would be beneficial to have thin graphene sheets so that more active sites are accessible to reactants. If more active sites are at the edge, reducing the lateral size of graphene sheets is beneficial for improving catalytic activity [43]. Other than the diversity in the active catalytic site structures and locations, the intrinsic catalytic activities of M–N–C electrocatalysts for different reactions are also strongly influenced by different types of M atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Cr, and Sn, as well as some precious metals: Ir, Rh, Pt, and Pd) [44–48], redox transitions of M atoms (e.g., M2+/M3+ of Fe, Co, or Ni and multi-valence transitions of Mn from 2+ to 5+) [40,49–51], Lewis basicity of carbon matrix induced by environmental atoms (e.g., N, S, B, and/or P heteroatoms) as well as defects in carbon matrices [50,52,53], functional groups attached to carbon matrices [54], and guest groups attached to metal atoms (e.g., Cl-, SCN-, or CN–) [55], as illustrated in Fig. 2(f). 4 Degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts A major challenge of M–N–C electrocatalysts is their poor stability, especially in acidic media under high potentials and high current densities, which is not surprised, considering that their active catalytic sites could be influenced by many of the factors discussed above. Further, M–N–C electrocatalysts are usually integrated into membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) together with additional carbon or metal substrates and ionomers (e.g., Nafion). The performance of MEAs could suffer from the degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts and other components in MEAs, electrode architecture collapses, and increased mass transfer resistances in their porous structures. Alternatively, M–N–C electrocatalysts may be assembled into self-supported electrodes, especially in gas-production reactions like OER and HER in water splitting. Several review articles have discussed various proposed degradation mechanisms and strategies to mitigate them [56–61]. The dominant degradation mechanisms of M–N–C electrocatalysts are the leaching of metal atoms from MN x C y sites (demetallation) and the oxidation of the carbon matrices and substrates. These two mechanisms usually work synergistically. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , demetallation causes direct loss of active catalytic sites. The leached metal ions indirectly catalyze the oxidation of carbon materials and ionomers and membranes in MEAs. The oxidation of the carbon matrices/substrates further accelerates demetallation. Besides these two mechanisms, several other processes have also been suggested as potential degradation reasons: the protonation of basic N groups followed by anion adsorption [62], surface hydrophobicity changes and the resulting water flooding [63], and the insertion of ions in carbon materials [60]. In the following subsections, we focus on the two main degradation mechanisms and some unique behaviors of MEA degradation and self-supported electrodes in more detail. 4.1 Demetallation of MN x C y sites Since major active catalytic sites in M–N–C electrocatalysts are MN x C y moieties. The loss of M atoms from MN x C y moieties would degrade their catalytic activities. The parameters of their atomic structures and working environments play essential roles in demetallation. On the structural aspect, the stability of MN x C y moieties and other metal species depends on their atomic structures and their interactions with the carbon matrices/substrates. Metal nanoparticles, especially those without carbon shell protection, would quickly leach into acidic media [64,65]. Metal chelates adsorbed on carbon substrates can detach from their substrates. Metal atoms in individual metal chelate molecules are less stable than MN x C y moieties embedded in large graphitic carbon matrices after thermal treatment. Jaouen et al. showed that two catalytically active FeN4C12 and FeN4C10 moieties have very different stability. FeN4C12 moieties are transformed into Fe oxides, while FeN4C10 moieties are much more stable [66]. M species in MN x C y moieties have different stability related to M ions’ stability in MN x C y moieties themselves [59] and the catalytic activity of leached M ions in Fenton reactions [67]. A recent density functional theory (DFT) calculation study identified three durable and three non-durable FeN4 moieties in Fe–N–C and found that FeN4 moieties at edge sites are less stable [68]. On the environmental aspect, the demetallation of MN x C y moieties changes dramatically in different working environments, such as pH, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), potential, current density. It is still challenging to separate the influences of these parameters experimentally. Theoretical studies sometimes can provide valuable guides. For example, Holby et al. used DFT calculations to quantify the stability of a FeN4 hosted in a bilayer graphene model and showed how Fe would leach from the model catalyst under different pH values and potentials, as shown in Fig. 4 (a) [69]. Significant fundamental studies are needed to gain a better in-depth understanding of demetallation. 4.2 Oxidation of carbon substrates The oxidation of carbon matrices/substrates would change the catalytic activity of MN x C y moieties and accelerate demetallation. There are two different types of oxidation processes: direct electrochemical carbon oxidation and oxidation by H2O2-induced ROS. Direct electrochemical carbon oxidation can thermodynamically start at a relatively low potential (C + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H+ + 4e–, E 0 = 0.207 V related to standard hydrogen electrode). However, its kinetics depend on the potential, current density, temperature, solution pH, graphitization, specific surface area, and defects/heteroatoms in carbon materials. For example, during the startup/shutdown of PEMFCs, carbon oxidation increases significantly above 0.9 V under high current densities at higher temperatures in acidic media [70]. As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), for carbon materials with different hybridizations, sp 3 carbon materials with fewer defects and smaller specific surface areas, e.g., boron-doped diamond [71], are much more resistant to oxidation over a wide potential window than other carbon materials. However, defective amorphous carbon or high surface porous graphitized carbon is currently more widely used to host MN x C y moieties because they provide more anchoring sites to increase the density of active catalytic sites in M–N–C electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, these carbon materials are often more vulnerable to oxidation, resulting in the fast degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts. H2O2 can be electrochemically generated in aqueous media by either ORR or H2O oxidation [72]. Fenton or Fenton-like reactions between H2O2 and transition metal ions, especially Fe ions, lead to ROS generation, such as ·OH, ·H, and ·OHH. ROS have higher oxidative strength than H2O2 [73]. These ROS oxidize carbon matrices/substrates [74], likely starting from defects or sites near doped heteroatoms. Upon damaging carbon matrices/substrates, metal ions are more prone to detach from MN x C y moieties, further accelerating Fenton or Fenton-like reactions [75,76]. Additional, oxidized or doped carbon materials are highly efficient electrocatalysts for H2O2 production themselves [77,78]. The oxidation of carbon matrices/substrates could, in turn, accelerate H2O2 production. 4.3 Degradation of MEAs and self-supported electrodes In various studies, M–N–C electrocatalysts that perform relatively stable when deposited as thin films on rotational (ring) disk electrodes (R(R)DEs) degrade much faster when assembled in MEAs [58,79]. Several factors may contribute to their faster degradation. First, due to their relatively low intrinsic catalytic activities, thick layers of M–N–C electrocatalysts are packed in MEAs, e.g., 100 µm about 10 times higher than that used for precious metal-based electrocatalysts. Higher mass transfer resistances in thick catalyst layers would bring various negative impacts. For example, H2O2 and ROS may be trapped inside catalyst layers, leading to more severe oxidation of carbon, ionomers, and polymeric membranes. The collapse and thinning of catalyst layers upon carbon and ionomer corrosion would lead to significantly higher oxygen transfer resistance [80]. Second, current densities used in MEAs (e.g., up to 500 mA cm−2) are much higher than those used in RDE tests (e.g., 10 mA cm−2). Higher current densities could accelerate both demetallation and oxidation. Third, electrochemical reactions usually occur at gas/solid/liquid interfaces in MEAs. The mass transfer limitations in thick catalyst layers significantly interrupt gas/solid/liquid interfaces, resulting in high potentials that accelerate degradation, for example, in PEMFCs during startup/shutdown or fuel starvation [81]. Currently, most M–N–C electrocatalysts are synthesized in the form of powders. The typical structure of MEAs with catalyst powders coated on carbon or metal conductive substrates together with ionomers/binders is suitable for ORR, NRR, and CO2RR. However, for gas evolution reactions, such as HER and OER, the gas bubble formation and migration strongly influence reaction kinetics [81,82] and cause mechanical shedding of catalysts from substrates, leading to fast degradation MEAs. An alternative approach is to assemble catalysts into self-supported electrodes in the 3D framework of microporous metal foams or carbon foams [82]. For example, a recent study has embedded Co–N–C into aligned porous carbon films to enable HER under high current density [83]. However, metal foams often become fragile in an acidic environment. The design and fabrication of carbon foams for self-supported electrodes are still at an early stage of research. 5 A balance art in migrating degradation vs. improving activity Many methods have been explored to improve the catalytic activities of M–N–C electrocatalysts and migrate their degradation. The majority of these methods would cause contradictory effects on activity and degradation. Based on current research results, we attempt to summarize the role of these methods into three categories: operational parameters, material structures, and other methods, as listed in Table 1 . We emphasize the tentative nature of our assignments in the spirit of simulating future studies. The “↑” signs in Table 1 refer to a positive enhancing effect of increasing a specific parameter listed in the first column on one of the catalyst characteristics listed in the first row. On the opposite, the “↓” signs refer to a negative suppressing effect. The “–” signs indicate no clear correlations have been reported based on current research results. For operational parameters, increasing potential, current density, and temperature would increase electrochemical reaction rates; but accelerate demetallation, oxidation, and MEA/electrode degradation. Lowering pH is beneficial for some reactions, such as ORR and HER, but it may not be desirable for other reactions, such as CO2RR. A lower pH would significantly speed up the degradation, especially Fenton reactions are much faster in acidic media. Poor stability in acidic media is one of the significant constraints of M–N–C electrocatalysts in reactions requiring acidic environments. Changing material characteristics often result in opposite effects on catalyst activity and stability. For example, although Fe has higher catalytic activities for ORR than other transition metal species, leached Fe ions cause severe Fenton reactions and generate ROS, attacking carbon matrices/substrates. Co, Mn, Cu, Cr, or Sn have been explored as alternative central metal species to minimize Fenton reactions but often displaying lower catalytic activity than Fe [45,47,84–87]. A potential solution may be the use of dual-metal sites. For example, a Fe-Co–N–C dual-metal site electrocatalyst has enhanced activity and stability compared to the corresponding single metal electrocatalysts. The Fe-Co dual sites are favored for activation of O-O [88]. In another study, a Pt single-atom was grafted on Fe–N–C to form a Pt1–O2–Fe1–N4 moiety, which was suggested to protect Fe–N4 and carbon substrates from the H2O2 attack [89]. The impact of M valence states on catalyst activity has also been reported [90]. Changing the coordination environment of M in MN x C y moieties from MN2, MN3, MN4 to MN5 affects both the intrinsic activity of M sites and degradation [91]. Carbon matrices/substrates with higher graphitization levels, such as carbon nanotubes, have higher electrical conductivity, which improves the intrinsic activity of active sites, and they are also more resistant to oxidation and demetallation [92]. However, highly graphitized carbon materials provide fewer anchoring sites for MN x C y moieties, thus decreasing the density of active sites. On the opposite, the defects and heteroatom dopants in carbon materials help to accommodate a higher density of active sites. A suitable type and concentration of defects and heteroatoms can enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of active sites by influencing the local electronic structures around MN x C y moieties. They also limit the fast agglomeration of single M atoms, simultaneously suppressing demetallation. However, carbon materials with more defects and heteroatoms are more prone to oxidative decomposition [93]. Further, depending on the location of MN x C y moieties in the carbon matrix, the density of edge sites and graphene sheet size would create oppositive effects on the density of active sites [42,43]. Edge sites are usually more susceptible to oxidation, while large graphene sheets with fewer edges resist oxidation. Carbon matrices with large specific surface areas are often pursued to increase the density of active sites; however, large surfaces expose more MN x C y moieties for demetallation and make carbon matrices more vulnerable to oxidation. The porosity of carbon matrices also has complex influences on activity and degradation. Most MN x C y moieties are located in micropores, which provide a significant fraction of the total surface area [94]. However, mesopores and macropores are essential for the mass transfer of gas molecules, ions, and reaction intermediates [95]. Hierarchical porosity with a combination of micro/meso/macropores would facilitate efficient access of active catalytic sites, increasing the usable density of active sites and reduce mass transfer resistances [96]. An efficient mass transfer may also limit the accumulation of H2O2 and ROS in catalyst pores, which reduces the chance of oxidation. Similarly, a suitable secondary porosity in catalyst layers of MEAs is also beneficial [97]. Along with a similar strategy, a thicker catalyst layer in MEAs would bring additional mass transfer resistances and lower the accessibility of active sites. Nevertheless, a thicker catalyst layer helps to extend the lifetime of MEAs because the undegraded electrocatalyst may still work [11]. Several other approaches have also been explored to migrate the degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts. First, protective shields can be added on top of MN x C y moieties which may slow down demetallation and oxidation. For example, a polydopamine-derived porous carbon shell protected FeN x C y active sites, enhancing catalyst stability in acidic and alkaline electrolytes [98]. A trade-off of applying protective shields is that they bring additional mass transfer resistances, lowering the accessibility of active catalytic sites. Second, several metal oxides have been integrated into M–N–C electrocatalysts as ROS scavengers to reduce carbon oxidation. For example, CeO2 was added to Fe–N–C electrocatalysts to diminish the presence of H2O2, leading to improved stability in PEMFCs [99]. It is desirable to in situ regenerate ROS scavengers so they can work continuously, but such demonstrations are currently missing. Third, different surface passivation processes may improve catalyst stability. For example, Fe–N–C electrocatalysts have been fluorinated with a hydrophobic and electron-withdrawing trifluoromethylphenyl group. It was proposed that such an electron-withdrawing group can alleviate the oxidavie corrosion and the hydrophobic property is also beneficial for mass transfer [100]. However, another study reported that fluorination by F2 would quickly poison Fe metal centers, resulting in the loss of catalytic activity [101]. In a recent study, surface passivation of Fe and Co–N–C electrocatalysts have improved their storage stability [102]. Forth, as discussed early, maintaining gas/solid/liquid interfaces is critical for MEA performance. In liquid or polymeric phases, ions, gases, and reaction intermediates have different solubility and mass transfer behaviors [103]. For example, ionomers usually exhibit a high proton conductivity, but thick ionomer layers would block efficient gas diffusion. Carbon oxidation creates hydrophilic surfaces, which could cause water flooding in MEAs, significantly increasing mass transfer resistances of ions and gases. The concentration and distribution of ionomers in MEAs strongly influence their degradation. Further, different surface coatings and chemical treatments have been introduced to manage carbon surface hydrophobicity and mass transfer [104,105]. Overall, a delicate art is required to balance and optimize these parameters to achieve high activity and stability. 6 Summary and future research directions In summary, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the catalytic activity and degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts in the past decades. However, the fundamental understanding of their degradation and in situ structural evolution remains vague. Some state-of-the-art M–N–C electrocatalysts have been used in pre-commercialization demonstrations. Nevertheless, many such electrocatalysts involve active sites embedded in carbon matrices with large surface areas and abundant defects and dopants, prone to fast degradation. Resolving the long-term stability challenge of M–N–C electrocatalysts will be the key to their commercialization. We propose the following future research directions. First, we need answers to some critical fundamental questions related to the activity and degradation of M–N–C electrocatalysts. For example, what specific MN x C y moieties are the most active and stable in different reaction conditions? What are the degradation kinetics of carbon materials with different hybridizations? What is the stability and degradation kinetics of MN x C y moieties in different carbon hosts? Immobilized molecular catalysts with well-defined atomic structures may serve as model catalysts to improve such fundamental understandings. Based on the answers to these questions, new catalysts may be designed and synthesized. Second, it is essential to evaluate catalyst degradation under the industrially relevant current densities, potentials, and solvent environments (e.g., acidic vs. alkaline) required by the targeted reactions. We need to balance the requirements of activity and stability. Otherwise, there is a high risk that most M–N–C electrocatalysts will remain topics of scientific curiosity without finding any practical applications. Third, the uses of M–N–C electrocatalysts in different applications likely pose significantly different stability requirements. PEMFCs require M–N–C electrocatalysts with excellent stability in acidic media. Electrolyzers used for water splitting or CO2RR need high stability in basic media. Tailoring M–N–C electrocatalysts for different applications will be an essential task.

Despite significant progress achieved in the past few decades, their commercialization is hindered by their fast degradation. This perspective article outlines the historical development of M–N–C electrocatalysts, the current understanding of their active catalytic sites, and crucial degradation mechanisms. We highlight that many methods used to tailor M–N–C electrocatalysts likely cause contradictory effects on activity and stability. More emphasis is needed to address their degradation issues under industry-relevant working conditions.",
