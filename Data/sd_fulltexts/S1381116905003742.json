Graphical abstract Newly developed alkali metal oxide/SiO2 catalyst shows a high catalytic performance in the vapor phase intramolecular dehydration of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone to N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone . Silica catalysts modified with alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide exhibited an excellent catalytic performance in the vapor phase intramolecular dehydration of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone to N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone in the temperature range of 360–400°C. The high activity and selectivity are considered to be due to the presence of both weak acid sites and weak basic sites on the modified SiO2. Keywords N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone Dehydration Basic catalyst Alkali metal oxide-added SiO2 1 Introduction N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) is a useful reactive monomer, which is used principally for the production of homopolymers and copolymers. These polymers are used as raw materials for pharmaceuticals, adhesives, paints, cosmetics and many others. The reaction of 2-pyrrolidone with acetylene in the presence of strong alkali in liquid phase is well known as a commercial process of NVP production (Scheme 1 ) [1]. This process, however, has some problems as follows: (i) It poses an explosion risk caused by the use of acetylene. (ii) The production facilities have to be located close to acetylene production plants. (iii) Alkaline salts of 2-pyrrolidone are used as the catalyst for acetylene addition reaction and the process exhausts a large amount of alkaline waste and solvents. The above problems will be solved if the vapor phase intramolecular dehydration of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone (HEP) to NVP (Scheme 2 ) proceeds efficiently by using heterogeneous catalyst. Although the intramolecular dehydration is known to proceed over ZrO2 catalyst [2], the catalytic activity of ZrO2 is not sufficiently high to be used for a commercial process. We have been searching for a catalyst better than ZrO2, and found that SiO2 turned out highly active and selective by addition of alkali metal oxides or alkaline earth metal oxides [3]. Based on this type of catalyst, our new NVP production process started up in the fourth quarter of 2001. We wish to report the performance of the SiO2 catalysts to which alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides were added, and the features of the active catalysts. The practical catalyst was developed on the basis of this study. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts Metal oxides (SiO2 and ZrO2) and alkali (or alkaline earth) metal oxides (oxides of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr and Ba) added metal oxides (SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2, La2O3 and WO3) were studied as the catalysts in this work. 2.1.1 Metal oxide catalysts Starting materials of SiO2 and ZrO2 were SYLISIA 350 (Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd.) and ZrO2 (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), respectively. These oxides in the powder form were first kneaded with water to form slurries. The slurries were dried at 120°C for 20h to form solids. The obtained solids were crushed into particles of 9–16mesh and calcined at 500°C for 2h in air. 2.1.2 Alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide-added metal oxide catalysts The mixtures containing various metal oxides and hydroxides (or carbonates) of alkali or alkaline earth oxides were kneaded with water. Then, the catalysts were prepared by the same manner as in the metal oxide catalysts described above. All metal oxides (TiO2, La2O3 and WO3) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. 2.2 Reaction procedures The vapor phase dehydration was carried out in a fixed bed flow type reactor under atmospheric pressure. Pulverized catalyst (9–16mesh, 5cm3) was placed in the stainless steel reaction tube having an inside diameter of 10mm, and heated to the reaction temperature in a molten salt bath. The reactant gas of 10vol% HEP in nitrogen was passed through the catalyst bed at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 2000–6000/h. Reaction was carried out in the temperature range of 350–400°C. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography. 2.3 Measurement of acid and base strengths of catalysts Acid and base strengths of the catalysts were measured by the indicator method [4]. Indicators used were p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (pK a =+3.3), 4-phenylazo-1-naphthylamine (pK a =+4.0), neutral red (pK a =+6.8), phenolphthalein (K BH =+9.4) and 2,4,6-trinitroaniline (K BH =+12.2). 2.4 Adsorption and desorption behavior of reactants on catalyst The catalyst (50mg) was fixed by quartz wool in the center of a stainless steel-made reaction tube having an inside diameter of 4mm and a length of 10cm. The nitrogen gas was passed through the catalyst kept at 300°C. A constant quantity (0.3μl) of the reagent was injected successively into the nitrogen stream ahead of the catalyst. The outlet gases were monitored by mass spectrometry. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performance of various metal oxides Table 1 shows the conversions of HEP and the selectivities to NVP over the metal oxides and various metal oxides loaded with alkali or alkaline earth oxide in the vapor phase dehydration of HEP. The conversion of HEP and the selectivity to NVP are defined as follows in the present report. Conversion (mol%)=100×(mol of consumed HEP)/(mol of fed HEP); Selectivity (mol%)=100×(mol of produced NVP)/(mol of consumed HEP). As shown in Table 1, all of the catalysts studied yielded NVP though the conversion and selectivity depended on the types of catalyst. Among them, SiO2 catalysts, both modified and non-modified, showed the NVP selectivity higher than 90%. The principal by-products observed were 2-pyrrolidone and acetaldehyde. With SiO2 catalyst itself, the NVP selectivity was very high while the HEP conversion was low. Such a low conversion was improved by the addition of a small amount of Na2O to SiO2. The conversion obtained with this catalyst (Na2O/SiO2 (1/20)) was much higher than that with SiO2 alone in spite of lower reaction temperature, and the NVP selectivity was also improved by the addition of Na2O. Addition of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides to the metal oxides other than SiO2 did not result in a good catalytic performance. 3.2 Catalytic performance of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide-added SiO2 Table 2 shows catalytic performance of various kinds of alkali (or alkaline earth) oxide-added SiO2. The HEP conversion was markedly improved by the addition of any type of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides to SiO2. In general, alkali metal oxides were more effective in improving the activity than alkaline earth oxides. The relationship between the catalytic performance and the ionization potential of the added alkali elements is shown in Fig. 1 . The HEP conversion decreased and the NVP selectivity increased with the decrease in the ionization potential of alkali elements. The basicity of metal oxide becomes stronger as the ionization potential of the metal is lower. The strength of basicity of alkali metal oxides is estimated to be in the order: Cs2O>Rb2O>K2O>Li2O. The order may hold when supported on SiO2. The highest activity of Cs2O/SiO2 is suggested to be due to the strongest basicity among alkali metal oxide-added SiO2. The low activities of alkaline earth oxide-added SiO2 as compared to those of alkali metal oxide-added SiO2 may be due to the weaker basicity for the former than the latter. However, it is not necessarily true that the stronger the basic sites, the higher the activity as described later in Section 3.4 on the basis of observation of color change of the indicators. 3.3 Effect of the amount of Cs in Cs2O/SiO2 catalyst The effects of the amount of Cs in Cs2O/SiO2 catalyst on the conversion of HEP and the selectivity to NVP are shown in Fig. 2 . The conversion increased steeply as the amount of Cs added increased to 0.05 atomic ratio of Cs/Si where the conversion almost saturated. The selectivity slightly increased on addition of Cs in the Cs/Si ratio of 0.002, and gradually decreased with further increase in the amount of Cs. 3.4 Acid and base strengths of catalysts The maximum acid strength of SiO2 itself was H 0 =+3.3. On the other hand, the alkali metal oxide-added SiO2 catalysts did not change the colors of all the indicators used; namely, the acid strength is weaker than H 0 =+6.8 and the base strength is weaker than H − =+9.4. 3.5 Effect of reaction conditions Fig. 3 shows the effects of GHSV and reaction temperature on the conversion of HEP under the following reaction conditions: catalyst, Na2O/SiO2 (1/20); HEP concentration, 10vol% in N2. At 360°C, the conversion linearly increased with the contact time, indicating that the reaction rate followed 0 order with respect to HEP. As discussed later, the catalyst surfaces should be fully covered with HEP at this temperature, and the product NVP scarcely remained on the surfaces. At 370 and 380°C, however, the relationships were not linear, indicating that the rates were positive orders with respect to HEP. From the initial rates at different temperatures, activation energy was calculated at 153.3kJ/mol. 3.6 Features of catalysts Adsorption and desorption behavior of HEP, NVP and N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) on the Na2O/SiO2 (1/20) catalyst at 300°C was studied by a pulse method. NEP was used for the purpose of investigating the role of hydroxyl group in HEP, since a hydroxyl group in HEP is replaced by hydrogen in NEP. As shown in Fig. 4 , the desorption peak intensity of HEP increased with the pulse number for the initial four pulses, and then leveled off after the fifth pulse. Each peak of HEP showed a long tailing, which suggests that HEP is strongly adsorbed on the catalyst. On the other hand, the desorption peaks of NEP showed an intensity corresponding to the injection amount regardless of the pulse number, and had no long tailing. These results indicate that NEP is not strongly adsorbed on the catalyst. During the reaction of HEP, the surface active sites are fully covered with HEP, and NVP is desorbed immediately after it is formed by the intermolecular dehydration of HEP. The adsorption behavior of NVP was similar to that of NEP, indicating that NVP was also adsorbed weakly on the catalyst. Considering the strong adsorption of HEP and weak adsorption of NEP, it is suggested that the strong adsorption of HEP is due to the interaction of OH group in HEP with the catalyst surfaces. Adsorption of HEP and the successive reaction are proposed as shown in Fig. 5 . HEP is first adsorbed on both base sites, O2− in –OM and/or –OH, and acid sites (M+, H+) on the catalyst surface of M2O/SiO2 and then forms NVP by the intramolecular dehydration. Although the acidic strength of alkali metal oxide-added SiO2 is very weak as measured by the indicator method, the role of the acid sites cannot be excluded. This reaction occurred on SiO2 alone. It is possible that the active sites are acid and base sites of hydroxyl group on SiO2. This hydroxyl group can remain on alkali oxide/SiO2 catalyst due to the amount of alkali oxide is not large enough to cover the SiO2 surface. The acid sites presumably interact with the O atom of the OH group in HEP. Table 2 shows the comparison of the catalytic performance of SiO2 with that of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide-added SiO2. This suggests that an acidic catalyst shows a low activity while a basic catalyst shows much higher activity, the NVP selectivity being almost unchanged regardless of the activity. This tendency is not clear for the catalysts other than SiO2. Probably, the acid site of silanol and/or silicate plays an important role in the catalytic performance. 4 Conclusions (1) We found that SiO2 to which a small amount of alkali metal oxide was added exhibited a pronounced catalytic performance for the intramolecular dehydration of HEP to NVP in the vapor phase. (2) The HEP conversion decreased and the NVP selectivity increased with the increase in the ionization potential of the alkali element added to SiO2. (3) For a good catalyst, the acid strength was weaker than H 0 =+6.8 and the base strength weaker than H − =+9.4. (4) It is presumed that HEP is adsorbed on acid–base pair sites on the catalyst through the interaction of the hydroxyl group in the molecule with those sites, forming NVP by the intramolecular dehydration.
