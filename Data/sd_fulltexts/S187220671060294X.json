Compared to Pd/AC (active carbon), the Pd/CMC catalysts showed significantly higher activity for the hydrogenation of large molecules due to their larger pore size. Key words: palladium; active carbon; supported catalyst; mesoporous carbon; pore size effect; microcalorimetric adsorption; È•-sitosterol; hydrogenation; È•-sitostanol High levels of cholesterol in human bodies are a serious problem for human health. Dietary approaches are considered more attractive than pharmacologic alternatives to lower the levels of cholesterol in general population. Naturally occurring phytosterols and their saturated counterparts, phytostanols, were found to be efficacious to reduce the cholesterol levels in humans and thus used as additives in foods [1â€“3]. It is believed that phytosterols and phytostanols inhibit the absorption of dietary and endogenously produced cholesterol from the small intestine, while the phytosterols/phytostanols themselves are only very poorly absorbed [4]. There are more than 40 different phytosterols, in which È•-sitosterol is most popular. The satu- rated derivative of È•-sitosterol is È•-sitostanol, which has been recognized as the more efficacious agent to reduce cholesterol than the un-saturated counterpart [5,6]. Furthermore, È•-sitostanol is resistant to oxidation, while È•-sitosterol contains double bond and can be oxidized to harmful steroid compounds [7]. However, È•-sitostanol is not abundant in nature. Thus, it is desirable to produce È•-sitostanol by the hydrogenation of È•-sitosterol. Some metal catalysts have been tested, among which nickel catalysts were found to be not suitable for the double bond hydrogenation of sterols. On the other hand, supported Pd and Pt catalysts were found to exhibit good per- formance for the hydrogenation of È•-sitosterol to È•-sitostanol [8,9]. Different supports have been used for Pd for the hydro- genation of È•-sitosterol to È•-sitostanol, including carbons [8,10â€“12], grafted polymers [8,13], and alumina [9]. The hy- drogenation of sterol esters to stanol esters was also performed over Pd/C [14]. Because È•-sitosterol is a relatively large molecule, supports with large pores are desirable to support Pd for the hydro- genation reaction. Recently, a mesoporous carbon (Sibunit) was used to support Pd for the hydrogenation of È•-sitosterol, which exhibited higher sitosterol conversion and stability than the Pd catalyst with microporous carbon as a support [3]. Pre- viously, a method was developed in our lab for the preparation of CMC [15]. In this work, such were used to support Pd for the hydrogenation of È•-sitosterol to È•-sitostanol. The CMC treated differently were suspended in water by stirring, during which aqueous solution of H 2 PdCl 4 was added. Palladium was deposited by the addition of aqueous solution of NaOH (pH Â§ 12). Formaldehyde solution was then added to reduce palladium. After washing with water, the Pd/CMC catalysts were obtained, which contained about 5% Pd (mass percentage). Three mesoporous carbons, CMC itself (20â€“40 mesh), CMC-200 (200 mesh), and CMC-200-NA (CMC-200 treated with concentrated HNO 3 ), were used as supports. A CHEN Hui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1777â€“1781 commercial activated carbon (AC, 200 mesh) was also used as the support for comparison. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of carbon supports and Pd/C catalysts dried at 393 K. Three diffraction peaks around 40.0Âº, 46.5Âº, and 67.7Âº were observed for the FCC Pd (JCPDS 89-4897) on Pd/CMC, indicating the poorly dispersed palla- dium in this catalyst. On the other hand, no diffraction peaks for metallic Pd were observed for the other catalysts, suggest- ing the highly dispersed Pd in these catalysts. Table 1 summarizes the textural properties of supports and Pd/C catalysts dried at 393 K. The results showed that the pore volumes and pore sizes were significantly larger for CMC supports than for AC. While the Pd/AC contained mainly micropores, the CMC supported catalysts possessed mainly mesopores. The surface areas did not seem to be de- creased a lot upon the loading of Pd for all the catalysts. The adsorption of CO was conducted at room temperature for the catalysts, which titrates the number of surface Pd sites in the catalysts according to the stoichiometric ratio (CO/Pd = 1). The surface metal area, metal dispersion, and particle size were also calculated accordingly. Table 2 shows the results. It is seen that the dispersion of Pd on CMC was poor (18.6%), consistent with the XRD result. The dispersion of Pd was increased to 27.7% on the CMC-200. The dispersions of Pd in Pd/AC and Pd/CMC-200-NA were similarly high (44%). The uptakes of CO indicated the numbers of surface Pd atoms in the catalysts, which was an important factor determining the activity for the hydrogenation reaction. Apparently, the small particle sizes of CMC-200 and CMC-200-NA favored the dispersion of Pd. The treatment with HNO 3 increased the surface oxygen-containing groups on carbons that promoted the dispersion of Pd [16]. The chemical properties of surface Pd atoms might be af- fected by the supports. This effect can be probed by the mi- crocalorimetric adsorption of CO. Figure 2 shows the results of microcalorimetric adsorption of CO on the catalysts. It can be seen that the uptakes of CO followed the same sequence for the catalysts (Pd/AC Â§ Pd/CMC-200-NA > Pd/CMC-200 > Pd/CMC) as that titrated by the adsorption of CO (see Table 2). However, the initial heats of CO adsorption on these cata- lysts were similar (about 100 kJ/mol), demonstrating the similar electron charges on Pd surfaces on different supports [17], i. e., the chemical properties of surface Pd atoms were not affected by the different carbon supports used in this study. The catalytic hydrogenation of È•-sitosterol was performed by using isopropanol as a solvent in a 100 ml autoclave for 3 h at 0.5 MPa and room temperature. The raw material (98.66% phytosterols) contained about 80.86% È•-sitosterol, 13.58% campesterol, and 4.63% brassicasterol.

CHEN Hui et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1777â€“1781 catalysts were filtered and washed with isopropanol. All the filtrates were collected and analyzed by an Agilent 1200 HPLC with an Eclipse XDB-C18 column and a differential refracto- meter detector. The results are shown in Table 2. Phytostanols were the only hydrogenation products. It is interesting to note that the conversion of phytosterols on Pd/CMC-200-NA was significantly higher than that on Pd/AC, although the numbers of surface Pd atoms were similar in the two catalysts. This might be due to that the Pd/CMC-200-NA possessed larger pores than Pd/AC, since the numbers of surface active sites and chemical properties of the two catalysts were similar ac- cording to the microcalorimetric adsorption of CO. The small pores in Pd/AC might restrict the diffusion of relatively large molecules of È•-sitosterols. The results in Table 2 also showed that the È•-sitosterol con- version increased with the increase of Pd dispersion in the mesoporous carbon supported catalysts, indicating that the catalyst was more active with more active surface Pd sites as long as the pores in catalyst were large enough. However, the Pd/AC with small pores was significantly less active than the Pd/CMC, although the Pd/AC possessed much more surface active Pd sites than the Pd/CMC, indicating that the pore size was a very important factor in determining the activity of hy- drogenation of È•-sitosterol to È•-sitostanol. Reaction temperature was found to affect the conversion of È•-sitosterol, while pressure had little effect. Less catalyst and short time could be used when the reaction was performed at higher temperatures. Specifically, 96% conversion of È•-sitosterol was achieved when the reaction was carried out at 343 K and 0.5 MPa for 1 h by using only 0.25% of the Pd/CMC-200-NA. In summary, the pore size and number of surface active Pd sites were found to be the two important factors in determin- ing the activity for the hydrogenation of large molecules such as È•-sitosterol over carbon supported Pd catalysts. Mesopor- ous carbons such as CMC possessed large surface areas and pore sizes, which were the appropriate supports for the dis- persion of Pd for the hydrogenation of large molecules.

Compared to Pd/AC (active carbon), the Pd/CMC catalysts showed significantly higher activity for the hydrogenation of large molecules due to their larger pore size.",
