Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Received 16 July 1996; received in revised form 16 October 1996; accepted 17 October 1996 Abstract The effect of various additives to platinum catalysts has been compared under standard reaction conditions at which aromatization of n-hexane occurs. With the same catalysts, (Pt/SiO2, Pt-K+/ SIO2, Pt-Mg2+/SiO2, Pt-KL zeolite, Pt-Mg2+-KL-zeolite, PffA1203, Pt-K+/AI203) dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has also been monitored. It has been established that the presence of K+- or Mg2+- additives can enhance the aromatization activity, but the condition is that the additive-free catalyst is monofunctional. A discussion of the data presented together with the relevant pieces of information from the literature leads to a conclusion that the effect of K+ or Mg2is of electrostatic nature, influencing the ring-closure. Keywords: Platinum; Hexane aromatization; Cyclohexane dehydrogenation; Potassium; Magnesiumm; Ring closure I. Introduction Aromatization of n-hexane, yielding benzene, is a commercially attractive reaction. It has been shown that the Pt-KL zeolite is a very good catalyst [1,2] for this reaction, its only drawback being the very high sensitivity of the catalyst to sulfur. Therefore, attention of the more fundamentally oriented research was up to now focussed on two questions: (i) why is the Pt-KL zeolite so active in aromatization and (ii) what is the nature of the high sensitivity of this aromatization to sulfur poisoning. Several hypotheses have already been formulated, to answer the questions above. With regard to the first one, one speculated on: (1) the * Corresponding author.

Fukunaga, V Ponec/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 207-219 confinement model [3]; (2) the end-on adsorption model [4,5] and (3) various electronic effects, mostly expected to operate between the small Pt particle and the zeolite lattice [6-9]. The 'electronic' effects were also evoked to explain the high sensitivity to sulfur poisoning, but a plausible alternative has also been suggested: sulfur causes aggregation of Pt particles accompanied by a blocking of channels by these aggregates [ l 0,11 ]. The ideas just presented can, indeed, explain most of the results known. However, Fukunaga et al. [12] formulated a new hypothesis, which found a full support by their own results: (a) K+ of the K-O zeolite groups exerts an electrostatic effect on the intermediates of aromatization, leading to an increase in the aromatization activity, (b) sulfur reacts preferentially with potassium, since the metal-sulfur (Pt-S) bond is weaker than that of K-S [ 12] and annihilates the effect of K+ on platinum. Alkali promotion of metals have been studied by many authors and in relation to various reactions [ 13-15]. Sometimes, very different effects of different alkali's or alkaline-earths have been seen. It is then an intriguing question why the pro- nounced beneficial effects of potassium (actually, potassium ion) promotion in aromatization were so far only observed with a monofunctional catalyst, the Pt-KL zeolite. This could have been due to the crystallographic structure of the KL- zeolite, due to the potential bi-functionality of the other catalysts investigated [ 13] or due to some other unknown factors. By this paper an attempt is made to throw more light on these problems. The approach is the same as in our previous paper [ 12] and it is based on two points: (1) cyclohexane dehydrogenation and CO adsorption (under standard conditions) should supply information on the activity and the area of the metallic surface; (2) n-hexane aromatization is monitored and it is supposed that it runs on the metal particles, promoted or promoter-free, and also on the acidic centres, when these are present. The acidic centres of A1203 are known to be less active in catalytic cracking (a reaction competing with isomerization and aromatization), than the strongly acidic centres of zeolites. Because of this complexity, it is expected that the effects of alkali-additives to various catalysts will not be uniform and the literature data, as far as they are available (see e.g. [13]) confirm that. However, it is difficult to make an exact comparison using the results in the literature, when the results have been obtained under non-standardized conditions (the same temperature, conversion, etc.). This paper presents the data obtained under standard conditions and that should make the identification of various effects of alkali-additives more easy. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation All catalysts used contained lwt% Pt. The amounts of potassium or magnesium added to Sit2- or A1203-supported catalysts were also of lwt%. Pt-KL was T. Fukunaga, V. Ponec/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 207-219 209 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. A KL zeolite powder (UOP), dried in an oven at 373 K for 3 h, was impregnated with an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4C12 under stirring. The impregnated KL was dried first at room tem- perature for 1 h and then at 373 K for 3 h in a drying oven, followed by calcination in flowing 02 at 573 K for 3 h. MgKL was synthesized by ion exchange of KL zeolite with Mg(NO3)2.6H20. For the preparation of Pt-MgKL, 5 g of KL was ion-exchanged by using 100 ml of 0.6 mol 1-l Mg(NO3)2 at 333 K for 2 h, and subsequently filtered and washed with 1000 ml of hot water. The exchanged zeolite was then dried in an oven at 373 K for 24 h. With this support, Pt impregnation, drying and calcination were performed in the same manner as applied to Pt-KL catalysts. Aerosi1200 (Degussa) and Pt(NH3)4C12 were used for preparation of Pt/SiO2 and Pt-M/SiO2 (M----K or Mg). K2CO3 and Mg(NO3)2.6H20 were used as precursors of K and Mg promoters respectively. After impregnation or co-impregnation, the catalyst was kept at room temperature for 1 h, whereafter water was slowly removed on a hot-water bath. Impregnated catalyst was then further dried in an oven at 373 K for 3 h and calcined in flowing 02 at 573 K for 3 h. Pt/A1203 and Pt-K]A1203 was prepared by the same method as Pt/SiO2 and Pt-K/ SiO2 respectively, except that PtCI4 and A1203-oxide C (Degussa) were used as precursors. Prior to the monitoring of a reaction, an ex-situ reduction in flowing H2 (20 ml min-1) at 773 K for 4 h and an in-situ reduction at 673 K for 1 h in 20 ml min- ~ of H2 flow, was performed. During reduction the temperature increase rate was 8 K min-~ in each case. 2.2. Reaction of n-hexane In a standard experiment, the reaction of n-hexane (n-C6) was carried out using a fixed-bed quartz reactor at 673 K and atmospheric pressure. For such an experi- ment, 0.02 g of catalyst was mixed with 0.98 g of fine granular quartz (0.2- 0.8 mm, from Merck Co). The H2/n-C6 molar ratio was kept at 16, by controlling the temperature of the saturator. The total flow of gases was varied to change the apparent contact time and consequently the conversion. Analysis of products was performed by gas chromatography (Packard, model 429) equipped with a capillary column, having an inside diameter of 0.53 ram, length of 25 m and the stationary phase of CP-Sil-5 CB (Chrompack). The theoretical values for detection factors were used according to Purnell [16]. The conversion (ct), selectivity (S) and yield (Y) were calculated from the corrected integrated signals by: (index 0 indicates the feed) In-C6 0/(%) = 1 /~n--C6J X lO0 210 T. Fukunaga, V.

Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene Dehydrogenation reaction of cyclohexane (c-C6) to benzene (Bz) was performed at atmospheric pressure, at 573 K, with H2/c-C6 molar ratio of 16 and total flow rate of 20 or 40 ml min-~. The same reactor and the same amount of catalysts were used for this reaction as for the n-C6 reaction. Pretreatment condition and product analysis condition were also the same as described above. 2.4. Catalyst characterization 2.4.1. CO adsorption The Pt dispersion of the catalysts was estimated from the CO adsorption. For this measurement, a 'Quantasorb' flow apparatus (Quantachrome) was used. After an ex-situ reduction in a quartz-reactor at 773 K for 4 h, the catalyst was passivated slowly by air and transferred. Then about 0.1 g of the catalyst was placed in the cell, and reduced in-situ by flowing hydrogen at 673 K for 1 h. The extent of CO adsorption was determined by injecting 0.1 ml pulses of CO into a hydrogen flow at room temperature. The CO in effluent gas was detected by a thermo-con- ductivity detector (TCD), coupled to an integrator. 2.4.2. Electron microscopy Determination of the Pt particle size distribution was carried out using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Bright-field TEM images were obtained on a Siemens Elmiskop 102, operating at 100 kV. 3. Results 3.1. The influence of the K+-additive Platinum (and actually, all metal) catalysts deactivate in the course of reactions of hydrocarbons. This is also the case with the studied Pt/SiO2 catalyst, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Deactivation is accompanied by changes, not very pronounced ones, in the selectivity: the formation of benzene, hexane isomers (i-C6) and methylcyclo- pentane (MCP) is increased. However, after 120 min on stream, (z----120 min) when the conversion is increased by lowering the flow rate (i.e. by increasing the apparent contact time) most of the just mentioned selectivity changes (Bz, MCP, T.

This indicates that the main effects of carbonaceous deposits deactivating the platinum surface are merely blocking of the surface and sub- sequent decrease in the apparent contact time. This has, of course, its consequence for the network [17] of parallel and consecutive reactions, like those shown in Fig. 2. Only the hydrogenolytic activity shows a slightly more pronounced change, which is not completely reversed by changing the apparent contact time. This role of carbonaceous deposits is known for some time already and has been explained by the so called ensemble effect. Hydrogenolysis is a reaction running with intermediates which require large ensembles of contiguous surface atoms and the number of these ensembles can be decreased by carbonaceous deposits [ 12]. The catalysts containing K+-additive behave with regard to their deactivation in exactly the same way as the potassium-free Pt-SiOa. The main effect of K+- additive is an increase in the aromatization activity (benzene yield) and a suppression of hydrogenolysis to C1-5. This can be seen in Fig. 2 of our earlier paper [12] and in Table 1 of this paper. f benzene l' n-hexane methylcyclopentane 3-methylpentane Fig. 2.

Cfrom TEM observations. It is reasonable to expect that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (c-C6) to benzene (Bz) is a reaction which occurs on the uncovered, freely exposed platinum surface. As we can see in Table 2, the presence of a K+-additive decreased the rate of the dehydrogenation, c-C6 ---* Bz, while, as we know already from Table 1, it increases the aromatization activity. Suppression of the activity in dehydrogenation of c-C6 and hydrogenolysis of n-C6 points to a blocking and ensemble size effects, respectively, the effect on aromatization is then clearly a promotion effect which prevails over the blocking effect. The role of the K+-additive in the Pt-KL zeolite catalysts is twofold. First, the K+-additive neutralizes the acidic OH groups and second, it influences [12] the reaction on platinum. It is still a matter of discussion, by which mechanism this influence is exerted, but the trend is the same as with the Pt/SiO2 --~ Pt+K+/SiO2 promotion: aromatization is enhanced considerably (Table 1, Fig. 3). With this catalyst there is a much lower deactivation observed, than with the silica supported, open-surface catalyst. Deactivation occurs only in the very first minutes and soon a state is reached which is constant with time on stream, also after 120min. Obviously, the incipient deactivation can be associated with small amount of platinum outside the zeolite cages. The space confinement has an important effect T. Fukunaga, V.

At the temperature at which the beneficial properties of the Pt/KL-zeolite manifest themselves strongly, the overall reaction network always consists of several parallel and consecutive reaction. When the apparent contact time is varied, the changes observed in the selectivity are in agreement with the scheme in Fig. 2 and also with those in the literature [18-20]. Investigation of Pt particles in the KL-zeolite by using electron microscopy (TEM) is not easy. Some Pt particles are seen immediately after starting the TEM observation, but during the observation the zeolite lattice is slowly destroyed and some other particles appear. Zandbergen et al. [21] described this phenomenon with Pt/ZSM5 and they concluded that the Pt particles do not grow measurably during the decomposition of the zeolite. Nevertheless, because of the just described effect and the small concentration of Pt particles, it is not possible to make firm quantitative conclusions on the particle size. We can only say that most of the particles have a diameter under 1 nm. The CO/Pt ratio indicates a high dispersion too (see also [12]). 3.2. The influence of the Mg2+-additive The influence on the Mg2+-additive on the behaviour of Pt-SiO2 is very similar to the effect of the K+-additive. (i) Deactivation occurs but it has only a small effect on selectivity. The latter effect can be reversed when the apparent contact time is increased, which indicates, here again, that the selectivity effect is due to the influence of the varying contact time on the extent of consecutive reactions.

Formation of benzene is enhanced by the presence of the Mg2+-additive (Table 1, Fig. 4). (iii) The average particle size of Pt-Mg2+/SiO2 is only slightly smaller than that of the Pt/SiO2, but if we look on the smallest particles, there is a substantial difference, the fraction of particles under 1.5 nm is with Pt-Mg2+/SiO2 twice as large as with Pt/SiO2. Adsorption of CO confirmed this difference. It was interesting to see, what happens when an Mg2+-additive is used, instead of a K+-additive, to neutralize the acidic centres of the Pt in zeolite catalyst. From the literature [22], we knew that the exchange of K+ for Mg2+ produces an acidic (not a neutral one) catalyst with a poor aromatization activity. Our results confirm this findings. As in the literature [23], a higher C3/C2-5 ratio (i.e. higher internal cracking, typical for acidic catalysts) has been observed. The beneficial effect of a Mg2+-additive can only be observed with a non-acidic support. 3.3. The influence of K+ on Pt/Al203 The system Pt/A1203 was the first industrial reforming catalyst and for this catalyst the classical scheme of bifunctional working has been established [24]. According to this generally accepted scheme, platinum is under reforming con- ditions covered by carbonaceous deposits to such extent that under our standard conditions, it mainly contributes to dehydrogenation and aromatization. The acidic centres of A1203 form carbenium ions from the olefines formed on Pt and induce isomerization, cyclization and the ring-enlargement of MCP, yielding benzene. Thus, benzene is formed by two independent pathways. When a K+-additive is present on the Pt/A1203 catalyst it not only influences the behaviour of Pt, but also T.

The result obtained with this system is shown in Fig. 5. A comparison of the K+-containing and the K+-free Pt/A1203, performed at (almost) the same conversion, revealed that the presence of K+ reduced benzene and MCP formation from 16.7 to 9.2% and from 30.3 to 22.9%, respectively. Obviously, the effect of K+ on the acidic centres dominates the changes in the selectivity. 216 T. Fukunaga, V. Ponec/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 207-219 4. Discussion The Pt-KL zeolite catalyst possesses a quite remarkable aromatization activity, also with regard to n-hexane [1-9]. (Aromatization of n-hexane is more difficult than that of higher hydrocarbons [2,20,22]). An attempt to explain this extra- ordinary property is made here, by a comparative study on several platinum catalysts. These catalysts contained platinum and an additive, both either exposed on the open surface or placed in a confined space in the zeolite cavity. The catalysts has been compared under reaction conditions at which the extraordinary catalytic properties of the Pt-KL-zeolite are well visible. This, however, means that a complicated network of consecutive and parallel reactions is already formed and the comparison should thus be done, amongst others, at (as much as possible) the same conversion. The knowledgeable reader has noticed that most of the catalysts we used are not new, the novelty of this contribution is in that, that all the catalysts are being compared under well chosen standard experimental condition. The Pt-KL catalysts excell, when compared with potassium-free platinum catalysts, by a very high aromatization activity. When a Pt/SiO2 catalyst is modified by a K+-additive, we observe the same trend: benzene yield increases, due to the presence of potassium. The same trend is also observed with Pt/SiO2, when a Mg2+-additive is used. It means that the promotion effect is probably related to the (positive) charge on the cation, rather than to the chemical nature of the cation. It has been stressed in the literature that the Pt-KL catalysts are very efficient because they are mono-functional [1,2]. This is very much so, because we have seen, during this study, that when the additive-free catalyst is bi-functional, the 'acidic' reactions and the change in their extent by the additives mask the function of the promoted platinum. In this study catalysts Pt-Mge+/zeolite and Pt-K+/A1203 were observed. In the overall reaction, the acidity should be taken into account; with the former catalyst it plays a detrimental role, whereas with the latter it plays a beneficial role. Although K+ can render the same direction in selectivity changes with open surface catalysts and with zeolitic catalysts, the effect of the potassium additive is much more pronounced with the zeolites. We ascribe it to the beneficial geome- trical arrangement of K+-O-Z with regard to the Pt-surface and the polarity of the O-K bond. Actually, a very similar effect has been reported for acidic zeolites containing platinum: the zeolite catalysts in which the Pt surface is in the nearest vicinity of the acidic center H-O-Z, show an extraordinary high catalytic activity [25,26]. The authors of the mentioned references speculate even on the 'platinum particle + proton(s)' -adduct formation. However, even when the association does not go so far as full dissociation of the O-H bonds, the proximity of protons (K+, in our case) and platinum is secured in the zeolite cavities. The reader might appreciate when we repeat here in brief, why we do not follow other explanations of the special Pt-KL properties, as suggested in the literature. T. Fukunaga, V. Ponec/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 207-219 217 There are two reasons to do so. (i) The structure of the zeolite can help, indeed, in achieving the high aromatization activity (see also above), but it is not the condition sine qua non. Also the open surface catalysts can show, after promotion, an increased aromatization activity (see [27] and this study). Thus, the 'confine- ment' or the 'orientation' (of the molecules) effects should not be used as the main basis for the explanation. (ii) There are serious physical objections against the explanation based on the various 'electronic' effects. We shall discuss this point in the following paragraph. The so called 'electronic' effects, influencing the platinum particle are usually related to some electron-donation to platinum. However, K+ cannot donate any electron to Pt (the second ionisation potential is 31.8 eV) and it is very doubtful whether the electrons localized on oxygen can be donated to platinum. Someone can object that, perhaps, a polarization of electrons in the Pt-particle is sufficient and no transfer of electrons is necessary. However, then the following points should be considered. (1) A charge in the metal or near to the metal surface causes polarization which is very much space-limited [28-30], when the metal particle possesses an average metal screening efficiency. (2) Even the small particles of metals in zeolites possess a normal, metallic screening properties [31]. While there are substantiated doubts about the possible electron-transfer and through-the-metal effects (see the last paragraph), there are enough theoretical reasons to believe in a through-the-vacuum, electrostatic field effect of cations [30,32]. Moreover, there is also an experimental evidence in the IR spectra of adsorbed CO, that this is a physically realistic picture [33-37]. There have also been intermediates of aromatization suggested [20,38-40] for which a promoting effect of cations in the vicinity of these intermediates, can be reasonably expected. The effect of the presence of promoters of aromatization is very different for the two reactions studied: n-hexane to benzene and cyclohexane to benzene, although the end-product is the same. This indicates that the promotion of aromatization is not an effect on the dehydrogenation of an alkane or cyclo-alkane, but rather an effect on the ring closure. The latter proceeds either via a stepwise dehydrogena- tion (n-hexane-hexene-hexadiene-hexatriene) or via intermediates bound to the surface by carbene-like or carbyne-like bonds, possibly in combination with a 7r- complexing of the olefinic bond in the intermediate [38-40,20]. Everywhere, where a donation-backdonation mechanism of bond formation is possible (this is the case of all intermediates just mentioned), a through-the-vacuum influence of an electrostatic field round a cationic charge is also possible. The authors of ref [41] express a very interesting idea that the presence of alkali cations can influence the conformation of the intermediates adsorbed on Pt; this can be a sterical or electric field effect. For the sake of completeness, a recent thorough study concerning the Pt- unsupported catalysts with or without potassium additives, should be also men- tioned [42]. In this study no pronounced effect of potassium additive on benzene formation (from n-hexane) has been claimed. However the study was performed at 218 T. Fukunaga, V Ponec/Applied Catalysis A: General 154 (1997) 207-219 lower temperatures than those used in our present and earlier [ 12] studies and since a pulse technique was applied, the results concern actually 'a very short apparent contact time' situation. Both aspects are unfavourable for an extended benzene formation (it stays low). Nevertheless, when we inspect Table 5 in [42] we observe that the presence of a potassium additive (KOH) doubles the benzene formation from 1 to 2%, similar to this paper, and the earlier one [12]. 5. Conclusions 1. The presence of K+ or Mg2+ in a neutral (non-acidic) catalyst promotes aromatization of n-hexane. 2. Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and aromatization of n-hexane are influenced differently, indicating that the step influenced by the promoters is in the ring- closure. 3. The mutual geometrical arrangement of the promoter and the metallic surface is essential for the size of the promoting effect. This too, supports the view that the promotion effect on aromatization is most likely and electrostatic through-the- vacuum effect. References [1] J.R.

The effect of various additives to platinum catalysts has been compared under standard reaction conditions at which aromatization of n-hexane occurs. With the same catalysts, (Pt/SiO2, PtK+/SiO2,PtMg2+/SiO2, PtKL zeolite, PtMg2+ KL-zeolite, Pt/Al2O3, PtK+/Al2O3) dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has also been monitored. It has been established that the presence of K+- or Mg2+-additives can enhance the aromatization activity, but the condition is that the additive-free catalyst is monofunctional. A discussion of the data presented together with the relevant pieces of information from the literature leads to a conclusion that the effect of K+ or Mg2+ is of electrostatic nature, influencing the ring-closure.
