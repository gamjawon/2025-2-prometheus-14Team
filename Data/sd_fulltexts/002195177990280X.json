KANUNGO Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar 5101 S, Orissa, India Received January 16, 1978; revised September 28, 1978 The catalytic activity of MnOs prepared by different methods has been determined from the initial rate of decomposition of Ha02 and the conversion of CO to COa. The activity is correlated with various physicochemical properties such as active oxygen, surface excess oxygen, surface OH groups, crystalline modifications, lattice parameters, and thermal decom- position data. Some of the above properties are interrelated. Experimental evidence shows that the presence of Mn3\"1\" as MnOOH in the MnOs lattice is mainly responsible for the origin of catalytic activity in nonstoichiometric manganese dioxide where electron transfer between Mn4\"1\" and Mn3\"1\" ions can take place. The loss of strongly bound compositional water creates lattice defects which are also responsible for the increase in the catalytic activity. The reason for the promoting effect of CuO in MnOa-CuO catalysts has been discussed in the light of the formation of \"surface CuMn204\" through the exchange of Cu2'1' on the hydrated manganese oxide surface. INTRODUCTION The high activity of manganese dioxide for the catalytic oxidation of CO and the decomposition of HaOa is well known. Not only manganese dioxide but also some nonstoichiometric higher oxides of man- ganese having the formular MnOr (where 2 > x > 1.5) are active catalysts (1, 2). The activity of such manganese oxide cata- lysts is promoted (3) by admixing other oxides such as CuO, NiO, Co20s, or AgaO. It is well known that nonstoichiometric oxides of manganese exist in various crys- talline polymorphic forms and that their physicochemical characteristics sometimes vary widely depending upon the method of preparation. It has been observed (4) that only a few crystalline modifications of Mn02 show satisfactory activity as depolarizers in the Leclanche cells. At- tempts were made to find out if such preferential activity exists toward various catalytic oxidation reactions. Thus Ball el al. (5) and Turner (6) were unable to oxidize benzyl alcohol over MnOa pre- pared by one method, whereas Harfeinst et al. (7) and Highet and Wildman (8) obtained benzaldehyde in excellent yield under the same conditions using Mn02 obtained by a different method of prepa- ration. A literature survey reveals that since the early investigation by Pitzer and Frazer (9) little attention has been given to the study of the catalytic behavior of Mn02 prepared by different methods espe- cially in the presence of CuO and its relationship with various surface and other properties of the catalysts. The object of this paper is to report and explain some results toward this end. 419 0021-9517/79/090419-17$02.00/0 Copyright 1979 by Academic Press, Inc.

KANUNGO EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Preparation of the Catalysts All the reagents used in the present investigation were of analytical grade (E. Merck, G.R.). All the manganese oxide (MnOi) catalysts prepared by the following methods were thoroughly washed with water until free from adhering ions and then dried at 110 to 120 for 6 to 8 hr. Unless otherwise stated, the two component catalyst system (MnO^-CuO) was prepared by precipitating Cu(OH)2 in the presence of Mn0.i catalysts by adding 1:3 NH40H to Cu(II) nitrate solution till the final pH was 6.5 to 7.0. The precipi- tates after thorough washing was first dried at 110 to 120 and then calcined at 200 for 4 hr. The ratio of MnO,, to CuO in the dried product was about 60:40. For the determination of catalytic activity toward the oxidation of CO all the catalyst samples were further calcined at 300 for 2 hr. The following catalyst samples were used in the present work. Sample 1. Oxidation of Mn(II) nitrate with KMn04 at the boiling point until the supernatant liquid shows slightly pink color. Sample 2. Prepared by the method of Pitzer and Frazer (2) by adding KMn04 to an aqueous solution containing Mn(II) and Cu(II) nitrates in the molar ratio of 3:2. Sample 3. Same as in method 2 except that the salt solution was added to the KMn04 solution. Sample 4. Cu(OH)2 was precipitated in the presence of sample 3. Sample 5. Reduction of KMn04 solu- tion at 70 to 80 with 1 :l(v/v) HC1. Sample 6. Sample 5 was leached in 3 M HNOs at 90 for about 120 min. Sample 7. Cu(OH)2 was precipitated in the presence of sample 6. Sample 8. Oxidation of MnS04 in hot acidified (2 N HaS04) solution by ammo- nium persulfate. Sample 9. Cu(OH)a was precipitated in the presence of sample 8. Sample 10. Thermal decomposition of Mn(II) nitrate at 130 to 150 for about 8 hr and finally grinding to less than 150 jum. Sample 11. Simultaneous thermal de- composition of Mn (II) and Cu (II) nitrates at 130 to 150 for 8 hr and grinding to <150ium. Sample 12. Oxidation of Mn(II) nitrate by sodium chlorate in strong nitric acid medium according to the method of Brooks (10). Sample 13. Cu(OH)2 was precipitated in the presence of sample 12. Active Oxygen Active (or available) oxygen was de- termined by the oxalate method. Manga- nese was estimated by the EDTA method in the presence of hydroxylammonium chloride and triethanolamine at pH 10. From these two values x in MnO,; was calculated. Trivalent (Mn3'*') manganese was esti- mated from the stoichiometry of the fol- lowing equation: MnO + Mn02 = MnaOa. Surface Oxygen Two different methods of determination of surface oxygen based on the work of Uchijima et al. (11) were used. They are (i) by hydrazine reduction and (ii) with KI at pH 7.1. Whereas the hydrazine method is usually carried out at the pH (8.0-8.5) of 0.1 N hydrazine sulfate solu- tion, the KI method is highly dependent upon the pH of the medium. However, for the sake of comparison of the different catalyst samples the KI method was carried out in the presence of phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). In method (i) a measured amount of 0.1 A\" hydrazine sulfate solution is allowed to react with a known weight of catalyst Mn02 CATALYSTS 421 sample for about 20 to 25 min in a closed vessel. The residual hydrazine after filtra- tion was titrated against 0.1 N iodine solution at pH 7.2. In method (ii) a known amount of catalyst sample, 15 ml of buffer solution, and about 2 g of solid KI were placed in a closed vessel which was vigorously shaken for 7 hr. The reaction mixture was then filtered, washed with methanol, and acidified with 1 N HC1, and the liberated iodine was titrated against 0.01 N sodium thiosulfate using starch as indicator. Surface OH Groups The method was developed by Laragne and Brenet (IS) for the determination of surface OH groups in Mn02. A known weight of catalyst sample (0.05 g) together with 20 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and about 2 g of KI were shaken thoroughly in a stoppered vessel for about 4 hr. The reaction mixture was then filtered and washed with DMF, and the liberated iodine was titrated against 0.01 N thio- sulfate solution without an indicator. X-Ray and Thermal Analysis X-Ray powder diffraction photographs were taken using Fe.K'o; radiation with a manganese filter for Mn02 samples and CuKa radiation with a Ni filter for Mn02- CuO catalysts. Various crystalline modi- fications of Mn02 were identified with the help of ASTM cards. Thermal analysis was carried out using a MOM (Budapest, Hungary) Derivato- graph at a heating rate of 10/min. DTA, DTG, and TG sensitivities were ^, i^, and 200 mg, respectively. The sample weight varied from 300 to 800 mg de- pending upon the bulk density of the sample. Surface Areas Surface areas of the catalyst samples were determined with a high speed surface area analyzer (Micromeritics Instruments Corporation) Model No. 2200, using low- temperature (96 ) nitrogen adsorption. Test for Catalytic Activity Decomposition of HiOt. The decomposi- tion of HaOs was followed by measuring the volume of oxygen liberated at atmo- spheric pressure in a gas burette. All the experiments were carried out using 0.02 to 0.05 g catalyst and a 0.018 M solution of stabilizer-free HaOa. The total volume of oxygen that could be theoretically liberated was calculated from the known concentration of HaOa and finally cor- rected for room temperature and pressure. Rate of decomposition was determined at five different temperatures in the range of 20 to 40. Both first-order and second-order rate constants were determined. The second- order rate constant was determined by converting the volume of oxygen liberated to the concentration of HaOa using the following formula (13): C = Co PV, RTVi where C = concn of H202 at time t (moles liter-1) Co = initial concn of HaOa (moles liter~1) P = atmospheric pressure (~1 atm) Vg = volume of oxygen liberated at time t (ml) V\\ = total volume of solution (ml). Oxidation of CO. Oxidation of CO was carried out by passing a gas mixture con- taining 5% CO in air (v/v) at a flow rate of 21 ml/min successively through SiOa gel, fused CaCIa, KOH pellets, and then through a 1-g catalyst bed packed in a tubular reactor immersed in a thermostat bath. The gas leaving the reactor was allowed to bubble through a known amount of Ba (OH) 2 solution containing one or two drops of phenolphthalein indicator. The 422 SUKRITI B.

The extent of conversion was calculated from the CO-s required to neutralize a known amount of Ba (OH) 2. All the measurements were carried out under the steady-state conditions which was attained after 5 to 6 hr of continuous flow of gas mixture through the catalyst bed. Apparent acti- vation energy values were obtained from the plots of log (percentage conversion) versus reciprocal of absolute temperature. RESULTS Kinetic Data for the Decomposition of HiOi The decomposition of H^Oa on catalyst samples 1, 2, and 3 follows second-order kinetics up to 40, whereas the other Mn02 catalysts follow almost first order with a break after about 40 to 50% de- composition. Incorporation of CuO by precipitating Cu(OH)2 in the presence of Mn02 catalysts does not promote the catalytic decomposition of H202 to an appreciable extent per gram of mixture; only a marginal increase is observed when MnO,, CATALYSTS 423 the rate constant is expressed per gram of Mn02. Therefore, as far as the catalytic decomposition of Ha02 is concerned the present method of preparing the two- component (Mn02-CuO) hopcalite system is not very useful. However, the presence of CuO causes the reaction to follow first-order kinetics, even for those samples which follow second order such as samples 1 to 3. Since the catalyst samples prepared by different methods exhibit different orders toward the decomposition of QiOs and at the same time show a strong apparent compensation effect, the catalytic activi- ties were compared by the initial rates of decomposition in terms of volume of oxy- gen liberated per second per gram of catalyst at 30 . Results are shown in Tables 1A and IB. From the present experimental data it is difficult to explain the observed change in kinetic law (as well as activation energy) as the mechanism of the decom- position of HiOs on metal oxides is a rather complicated one. However, on the basis of our existing knowledge of catalytic decomposition of ll^Oi we may write the following reaction steps: (I) HisOa ?H+ + HC>2- (II) S* + HOa- ^ (SOaHU (III) (SOaH)^, + H^Oa -^ H^O + 02 + OH- + S* (IV) H+ + OH- ?HaO where S* in step (II) is an Mn4'1\" site. Assuming that step (III) is rate control- ling, the rate of decomposition will follow first order if the concentration (or number) of (802H)ads is large in comparison with the concentration of Ha02, i.e., when the surface is extensively covered with HOa- ion. If this is not so (due to some un- explained reasons) the rate will be pro- portional to the concentrations of both HaOa and HO 2- which in turn is propor- tional to H20a concentration. Therefore, the reaction will follow second order. Perhaps the large amount of acidic OH groups in some samples is responsible for the low adsorption of H02- ion on the catalyst surface. Kinetic Data for the Oxidation of CO Except for sample 3 the activity of all the manganese oxide catalysts used in the present work is poor for the low-tempera- ture oxidation. The good activity of sam- ple 3 is probably due to the adsorption of Cu^ ions on the surface of MnO, during its preparation. However, a con- siderable increase is recorded when CuO is introduced either by precipitation as Cu(OH)2 or by simultaneous thermal de- composition of nitrates and subsequent calcination at 300 . All the two com- ponent catalysts exhibit breaks in the Arrhenius plots at 50 to 60 , so that an activity parameter could be obtained only at temperatures below 50, e.g., at 40 where the reaction is predominantly chemi- cally controlled. In comparison with the sharp increase in activity for such MnOa- CuO catalysts there is only a marginal decrease in apparent activation energy. For single component catalysts the Ar- rhenius plots follow linear behavior up to 90 and since at 40 the conversions are very small activities are compared at 80 . Results are shown in Tables 1A and IB. Physicochemical Characteristics X-ray diffraction pattern. The brownish- colored dioxides such as sample 2, 3, 5, and 6 are partially amorphous in nature as revealed from the broad and diffuse diffraction patterns, whereas the black oxides are well crystallized as indicated by the sharp powder patterns of the samples. The powder patterns also show that all the four important polymorphic forms of MnOa, viz. a, f3, y, and S are present among the catalyst samples.

The indexing of the diffraction lines was carried out using an analytical method on the basis of some assumed symmetry which was verified from the similarity in the calculated and the observed d(A) values. The unit cell parameters of the various MnOa catalyst samples are shown in Table 2. Diffraction patterns of sample 11 and 13 indicate the minor formation of surface compound such as CuMn204 in addition to the strongly predominant CuO lines (Fig. 9). Surface and active oxygen content. The importance of both surface and active (or available) oxygen content of Mn02 in the catalytic oxidation of CO has been emphasized by various authors (1^., 15). While the surface oxygen is essentially a surface property of the catalyst, active oxygen is a bulk property and therefore may not be wholly responsible for the catalytic oxidation reaction. However, the two different methods of estimating sur- face oxygen give different values, i.e., the results obtained by the hydrazine method is four to seven times higher than that determined by the KI (pH 7.1) method. Kobayashi et al. (14) also observed that the hydrazine method gives 15 to 25 times higher values than the KI (pH 7.1) method. This is probably because hydra- zine attacks the bulk oxygen of the catalyst and reduces the MnOa while KI at pH 7.1 or above does not attack bulk oxygen to any appreciable extent. This is evident from the similarity in the order of magni- tude of the surface oxygen content cal- culated from the unit cell parameters [0.67 power of the bulk concentration, Ref. (10)~\\ and from the KI method as shown in Table 2. A high value for sample 12 indicates that a considerable amount of oxygen is chemisorbed on the surface. Figures 1 and 2 show that the effect of surface oxygen content determined by both hydrazine and KI (pH 7.1) methods on the activity of Mn02 catalysts. The nature of the effect of surface excess oxygen on the two catalytic reactions appears to be different. Although a higher surface oxygen content has a profound effect on the activity for the oxidation of CO, the same is not true for the de- composition of H^Oa. On the other hand, 426 SUKRITI B.

Surface OH groups. The effect of the presence of surface OH groups on the catalytic activity of Mn02 can only be tested with the decomposition of 202 which is carried out in an aqueous medium since it is believed that the presence of water poisons the activity toward the oxidation of CO. In Fig. 3 the initial rate of decomposition of H202 at 30 is plotted against the surface OH groups.

Superscripts denote the catalyst sample numbers. OH groups indicating that a large quantity of OH groups does not help in increasing the activity of the catalyst. The interesting aspect of the method is that physically adsorbed water molecules do not take part in the exchange of H+ (in OH group) with K+ in DMF medium. Since at 200 drying temperature all the physically ad- sorbed water molecules are lost and at 400 both physisorbed and chemisorbed water are removed the difference in the weight loss at the two temperatures should give at least an order of magnitude of the amount of chemically bound water since nonstoichiometric MnOa may lose some oxygen with increase in calcination tem- perature. However, the amount of such oxygen loss at 400 is very small as shown by Hasegawa et al. (15). Figure 4 shows that the relationship between the activity and the difference in weight loss at 400 and 200 is very similar to that obtained in Fig. 3. The reason for the sharp deviation with sample 12 is probably the loss of some oxygen at 400. Thermal analysis. Thermal analysis (25- 1000) of Mn02 catalysts prepared by various methods exhibits under dynamic conditions (i.e., with increasing tempera- ture at constant heating rate) mainly four different thermal effects (Fig. 5). These are: (i) Loss of physically adsorbed mo- lecular water (100-200) characterized by a sharp endothermic DTA and DTG peak accompanied by a well-defined stage in the TGA curve, (ii) Loss of chemically bound or compositional water and change of crystalline phase (for example, 7-MnOa to i8-Mn02) characterized by a broad exothermic hump which sometimes sup- presses the endothermic effect due to the loss of compositional water in the tem- perature region of 200 to 400. Except for samples 1 and 12 the DTG peak in this temperature region is normally poorly defined. However, from the TG curve one can easily identify the second stage of water loss.

Numbers at right-hand side denote the catalyst sample numbers. characterized by a sharp change in weight loss in the TGA curve. In samples 3 and 5 the endothermic peak is immediately fol- lowed by a small exothermic effect indi- cating the recrystallization of poorly crystalline reduced oxides, (iv) Endo- thermic decomposition of MngOg to Mns04 in the temperature region of 850 to 1050. This effect is sometimes poorly defined and lies beyond 1050 for well-crystallized samples such as /3-Mn02. The fchermograms of two component (Mn02-CuO) catalysts are essentially simi- lar to those of their precursor MnOa except that peaks are smaller due to a smaller amount of manganese dioxide. The data accumulated from the thermal decomposition characteristics of the sam- ples are given in Table 3 which provides valuable information regarding the cata- lytic activity of manganese dioxide. Thus Fig. 6a shows the relationship between the DTA peak temperature for initial molecu- lar water loss and the activity toward the oxidation of CO. The percentage conver- sion increases sharply as the peak tem- perature increases from 120 to 175. An exactly opposite behavior is observed in Fig. 6b where the percentage conversion is plotted against the DTA peak tempera- ture for the decomposition of Mn02 to MnaOg. The two figures clearly indicate that these two DTA peak temperatures are interrelated, i.e., the dehydration tem- perature of Mn02 has a profound effect on the stability of the oxide which in turn is again related to the catalytic activity. Surface area. Table 2 shows that the specific surface areas of poorly crystalline samples prepared from KMn04 are higher than those of well-crystalline varieties. However, the catalytic activity of the samples does not seem to be entirely dependent on the specific surface area as one can observe from Tables 1A and 2. Various other factors as described in the preceding paragraphs also play important roles in controlling the catalytic activity. DISCUSSION The solid-state chemistry of nonstoi- chiometric manganese dioxide is com- plicated because many of the properties are related to the nature of the crystalline modifications (16). Even minor structural differences may affect the behavior of the samples significantly. Some of the crys- talline modifications of Mn02 such as the Mn02 CATALYSTS 429 120 140 160 ISO DTA PEAK TEMP.

Although various authors {16) have proposed different general formulae for nonstoichiometric MnOa, the one proposed by Brouillet et al. {20) probably explains the experimental results obtained in the present work. The formula may be written as [Mn02]i-.CMnOOH], or, for electrical neutrality, Mni-y+Mn^+Oa-,2- (OH),-. Since such oxides also contain physically sorbed molecular water a more realistic formula should be Mni-.^+Mn^+Oa-.^OH),-, mHaO. Lee et al. {21) observed that certain physisorbed water molecules are bound to the underlying OH groups via hydrogen bonds as has already been found for ThOa, Si02, and Fe20s [quoted in Ref. {21)~\\. Naturally, the removal of such \"struc- tured\" water requires a higher desorption energy and hence higher DTA peak tem- perature. Such energetic desorption leads to lattice distortion and consequent in- crease in the catalytic activity, as evident from Fig. 6a. Although Brenet {22) has stated that both the electrochemical (in dry cell) and the catalytic activity of MnOa are dependent on the compositional OH groups, so far no author has shown any experimental evidence. In Figs. 3 and 4 we have shown a definite correlation between the compositional water (or OH groups) and the catalytic activity. The second stage of water loss in the TG and the DTG curves is primarily a dehydroxylation process. According to Lee et al. {21) this process consists of two parts; the water from the first part comes from the energetically homogeneous sub- surface layer and is dissociatively chemi- sorbed on the surface. The latter involves the removal of strongly coordinated bulk hydroxyl groups. The dehydroxylation 432 SUKRITI B.

The removal of such strongly bound OH groups is also accompanied by the loss of oxygen thereby weakening the lattice structure leading to the decomposition at lower temperature. Therefore, the greater the quantity of compositional water the lower the DTA peak temperature for decomposition to MnzOg which is thermodynamically a more stable phase. Though the importance of surface ex- cess oxygen on the catalytic activity of MnOa for the oxidation of CO has been repeatedly emphasized by various authors, no satisfactory explanation has so far been forwarded for the origin and nature of this oxygen. However, the general agreement is that during the preparation of the cata- lyst some oxygen is chemisorbed on the surface which is more mobile and is re- sponsible for the catalytic oxidation of CO even at 20. In fact, Brittan et al. (23) proposed that the primary and rate-con- trolling step is the adsorption of CO on a site where it can combine with surface oxygen to form an unstable intermediate surface carbonate complex. From the Mn02 CATALYSTS 433 study of the ir spectra of CO adsorbed on the Mn02 catalyst Davydov et al. (24) concluded that the catalyst when treated in a vacuum at 300 does not oxidize CO even at 200. This indicates that the oxidizing properties of MnOa are deter- mined by the presence of oxygen disso- ciatively chemisorbed on the surface. The most firmly bound forms of oxygen are most reactive, but when the catalytic reaction takes place at a low temperature their reaction is blocked by the reaction intermediate (carbonate complex) which is decomposed at 150 or above. There- fore, oxidation of CO to CO 2 at low tem- perature takes place with the less firmly bound forms of oxygen. Brouillet et al. {20) postulated that during the second stage of water loss oxygen vacancies are created. In an oxi- dizing atmosphere (e.g., in air) these sur- face vacant sites chemisorb oxygen. The broadening of the exothermic peak be- tween 250 and 400 supports this idea, because any oxidation reaction is an exo- thermic process. The reactions may be written as follows: 2MnOOH -> Mn02 + [Mn02 + (O)vacancy] + HaO 2[MnOa + (O)vacancy] + 02 -> 2Mn02. This chemisorbed oxygen has strong oxi- dizing power and most probably accounts for the surface excess oxygen determined by the KI (pH 7.1) method. The above two equations indicate that there is a cor- relation between surface OH groups and surface oxygen atoms which has clearly been shown in Fig. 7. This has further been substantiated from Fig. 8 which shows the direct relationship between the difference in weight losses at 400 and 200 and the surface oxygen content. It can be assumed, as a first approximation, that the type of water present and the mobility of oxygen in the Mn02 lattice may be closely interrelated to provide a suitable environment for the catalytic reaction to take place. Since in the foregoing paragraphs it has been proposed that the compositional 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.1 FRACTION OF Mn3-1- IN TOTAL Mn FIG. 10. Relationship between catalytic activity and the Mn3'1' content of MnOa catalysts. Superscripts denote the catalyst sample numbers. 434 SUKRITI B. KANUNGO water (or OH groups) in MnOa occur mostly as MnOOH, it is expected that the catalytic activity should increase with increase in Mn^ content. This proposition derives some support from Fig. 10 which shows the plot of activity for the oxida- tion of CO and the decomposition of HsOa vs Mn^ content in the MnOa cata- lyst samples. It has been observed (22) that small metal ions in the MnOa lattice may be- come oxidized or reduced without changing their positions unless the process is suf- ficient to lead to a new phase. Here perhaps lies the actual reason for the catalytic activity of nonstoichiometric Mn02, i.e., as in the CuMn204 spinel structure electron exchange between Mn''+ and Mn'+ can easily take place in the solid phase without the ions changing their positions {.25). This observation also shows that in contrast to the present belief the presence of some OH groups appears necessary for the activity of MnOs toward the oxidation of CO. In other words, completely dehydroxylated (or oxi- dized) Mn02 is not an active catalyst for the low-temperature oxidation of CO. The lattice parameters of Mn02 catalyst samples as shown in Table 2 indicate that the area of the ab plane is much higher than either the be or the ca planes. Besides, the apices of the MnOe octahedra which are the basic building units in the chain structure of Mn02 crystals, are protruded on the ab plane. Anion vacancies probably occur at the apices thereby rendering the adsorbed ligand accessible to the metal ion. These observations indicate that catalyti- cally active centers are possibly concen- trated on the (001) plane. The high activity of Cu20 for the oxidation of CO has been explained by Stone (26) from a similar observation on the unique crystal structure of CuzO. The sharp increase in catalytic activity of two component catalysts (Mn02-CuO) such as samples 7, 9, and 13 toward the oxidation of CO can also be explained from the presence of MnOOH on the surface of Mn02. Since Cu(OH)2 was precipitated by adding 1:1 NH40H to Cu(NOs)2 solution in the presence of solid Mn02 there was no possibility of manga- nese dissolution in such an alkaline medium. Therefore, the only possibility of bringing Cu^ on the surface of Mn02 is through ion exchange which is known to occur in hydrated Mn02. Extensive work (27) has been done on this subject: Mn 0 OH .cu2! Mn 0 OH MnOO^ 'Cu + 2H+ MnOO^ The formation of such \"surface CuMn204\" will depend upon the exchange capacity of the manganese dioxide. The absence of any promoting effect of CuO in sample 4 is due to the fact that sample 3 was already prepared in the presence of Cu^ ion and the surface was extensively ex- changed with Cu^ ions. The increase in catalytic activity with sample 11 is also due to the formation of CuMn204 as is evident from the X-ray diffraction pat- tern (cf. Fig. 9). The formation of CuMn204 during the simultaneous thermal decomposition of Mn(II) and Cu(II) ni- trates has already been reported (28). The reason for the poorly developed spinel lines in the powder patterns of samples 11 and 13 is due to the large excess of free CuO in the catalyst samples.

Kanungo Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar-751013, Orissa, India The catalytic activity of MnO2 prepared by different methods has been determined from the initial rate of decomposition of H2O2 and the conversion of CO to CO2. The activity is correlated with various physicochemical properties such as active oxygen, surface excess oxygen, surface OH groups, crystalline modifications, lattice parameters, and thermal decomposition data. Some of the above properties are interrelated. Experimental evidence shows that the presence of Mn3+ as MnOOH in the MnO2 lattice is mainly responsible for the origin of catalytic activity in nonstoichiometric manganese dioxide where electron transfer between Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions can take place. The loss of strongly bound compositional water creates lattice defects which are also responsible for the increase in the catalytic activity. The reason for the promoting effect of CuO in MnO2-CuO catalysts has been discussed in the light of the formation of “surface CuMn2O4” through the exchange of Cu2+ on the hydrated manganese oxide surface.
