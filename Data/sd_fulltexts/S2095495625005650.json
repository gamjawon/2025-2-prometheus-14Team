Graphical abstract S-doping modulates the second-nearest neighbor environment of Mn–N4 sites, which optimizes the electronic structure and weakens *OH adsorption, thereby enhancing ORR activity of Mn–N–S–C. Regulation of the second nearest neighbor coordination atoms is a potent strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of manganese-nitrogen-carbon (Mn–N–C) catalysts with Mn–N4 sites. However, precisely regulating the second-nearest neighbor coordination environment of the Mn site is still challenging. Here, a novel approach is proposed to modulate the local microenvironment of Mn–N4 sites by strategically doping sulfur (S) atoms at the second nearest neighbor coordination positions to address this challenge. Density functional theory calculations elucidate that S-doping at these positions significantly alters the charge distribution of the Mn site, inducing a downshift in the d-band center of Mn. This electronic modulation weakens the binding strength of the Mn site toward the *OH intermediate, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the ORR process. To experimentally realize this concept, the strategic molecular assembly approach is employed to precisely incorporate S atoms into the second nearest neighbor coordination of the Mn site, resulting in the construction of the manganese-nitrogen-sulfur-carbon (Mn–N–S–C) catalysts. The Mn–N–S–C showcases a favorable half-wave potential of 0.913 V. When integrated into rechargeable liquid zinc-air batteries (ZABs) the Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs deliver high power density of 209.8 mW cm−2 and stable cycling performance for 800 h. Furthermore, Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs exhibit a power density of 34.05 mW cm−2 and a cycle life of 23 h. This study highlights the importance of the second nearest neighbor coordination atoms in tuning the electronic structure of single atom active sites, proposes a method to enhance ORR efficiency through atomic-level engineering, and demonstrates the practical application of the Mn–N–S–C catalyst in high-performance energy storage systems. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principles for next-generation catalyst design and support advancements in energy conversion and storage technologies. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Second nearest neighbor coordination Sulfur doping Mn–N4 sites Zinc-air batteries 1 Introduction Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are considered a leading candidate for advanced energy conversion and storage technologies, presenting compelling advantages for applications in mobile electronics and electric transportation networks. These benefits stem from their economical production costs, intrinsic operational safety, and exceptional theoretical gravimetric energy density of up to 1084 Wh kg−1 [1,2]. Notwithstanding these merits, the commercialization of ZABs technology faces significant hurdles, primarily due to suboptimal electrochemical conversion efficiency. This deficiency originates from the kinetically hindered four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway occurring at the air cathode interface [3,4]. Consequently, advancing the development of high-performance catalytic materials represents a pivotal research frontier for addressing the ORR catalyst bottleneck and facilitating the practical implementation of ZAB systems [5]. Although Pt-based catalysts can accelerate ORR kinetics, their limited availability, high cost, and stability issues restrict their widespread application [6,7]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop non-precious metal catalysts with outstanding ORR activity. Among various candidates, metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−N−C) electrocatalysts have garnered significant research interest, particularly for their isolated M−N x centers [8,9]. Mn–N–C catalysts boast a cost-effectiveness edge over Fe–N–C counterparts. Mn atoms possess a wealth of oxidation states, and dope with other elements can modulate their surrounding electronic and geometric structures more effectively [10,11]. Moreover, Mn–N–C catalysts surpass Fe–N–C in stability and corrosion resistance within alkaline solutions [10,12]. Thus, Mn–N–C is pinpointed as the focal point of this study. However, the symmetric charge distribution in the Mn–N4 structure in Mn–N–C typically complicates the desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, which in turn restricts further enhancement for ORR activity in Mn–N–C systems [13,14]. While the high electronegativity of N atoms can strengthen the adsorption energy at Mn sites, which is crucial for interacting with ORR intermediates, too strong adsorption can heighten the reaction energy barrier, thereby limiting performance enhancement potential [15,16]. To circumvent these issues, researchers are exploring strategies such as modifying the coordination environment around Mn sites to enhance the ORR performance of Mn–N–C electrocatalysts [15,17]. Regulation of the second nearest neighbor coordination environment of the Mn site has been proven to effectively enhance the ORR performance of Mn–N–C electrocatalysts, as shown in recent studies [18]. The electronegativity of sulfur (S, χ = 2.58) is close to that of C (χ = 2.55) and higher than phosphorus (P, χ = 2.19) and boron (B, χ = 2.04). The close electronegativity of S and C enables the S atom to bind more harmoniously to the carbon support, which is conducive to precise doping near Mn–N x sites and the formation of the second nearest neighbor coordination of the Mn site in Mn–N–C electrocatalysts [19]. Contrasting with P and B atoms, S atoms with higher electronegativity can capture more charge at the Mn–N4 sites. This shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level and weakens O2 adsorption on Mn. Therefore, S atoms, when acting as the second nearest neighbor coordination atoms, can optimize adsorption and desorption of intermediates, consequently reduce the reaction barrier and elevating the catalytic performance of Mn–N–C catalysts [20,21]. The second nearest neighbor coordination atoms around Mn site can form an asymmetric charge distribution and modify electron localization without destroying the Mn–N4 structure, thus improving the structural stability and reaction selectivity of Mn–N–C [22]. Introducing S atoms into the second nearest neighbor coordination environment can also significantly increase the specific surface area and electron conduction capability of Mn–N–C electrocatalysts by constructing porous structures and improving the electron transfer and mass transfer efficiency, thus improving the overall ORR performance of Mn–N–C electrocatalysts [17,23,24]. Furthermore, S atoms can induce structural distortion, which facilitates the accessibility of nitrogen lone electron pairs. This synergizes the strong electron-withdrawing effect of N atoms with the polarization effect of S to optimize the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediates [17,25]. Therefore, the ORR activity for Mn–N–C could be enhanced by accurately doping S atoms into the second nearest neighbor coordination of Mn sites through a reasonable design strategy. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were initially deployed to predict that the manganese-nitrogen-sulfur-carbon (Mn–N–S–C) catalyst, with S atoms at the second nearest neighbor coordination of Mn sites, can exhibit significant ORR activity. The S atoms can significantly alter the charge distribution of the Mn–N4 sites, thereby weakening the adsorption of *OH intermediate. This regulation facilitates a reduction in the ORR energy barrier and promotes the overall ORR performance regarding Mn–N–S–C. To achieve precise second nearest neighbor coordination doping of the S atom, a molecular assembly approach was strategically employed using selecting α-cellulose, guanidine chloride and thiourea as precursors. The OH of α-cellulose and NH2 of guanidine chloride engaged in hydrogen bonds to create macromolecular frameworks. Meanwhile, N atoms with lone pairs from the NH2 group coordinated with Mn2+, contributing to forming Mn2+ (NH2 CS) x /Mn2+–(NH2) x complexes. Subsequent pyrolysis stabilizes Mn atoms by anchoring them to N atoms, forming Mn–N x –S y groups, and thus achieving S-doping at the second nearest neighbor coordination. These features collectively enhance the catalytic performance of Mn–N–S–C catalysts. Consequently, Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs showcase excellent power density, decent specific capacity and sustained cycling stability, making them promising for practical applications. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Theoretical calculations and predictions DFT calculations were employed to understand the enhancement mechanism of ORR activity caused by doping S atoms into the second nearest neighbor coordination around Mn sites. The computational models for Mn–N–C and Mn–N–S–C are presented in Fig. S1. The charge density difference between Mn and the environment reveals the effect of the S atom (Fig. 1 a). Obviously, the charge distribution of Mn in Mn–N–C differs from that in Mn–N–S–C. Mn site and four non-metal atoms as adsorption sites are selected for calculating the O2 adsorption energies, including the C atom adjacent to Mn–N4, the N atom near the S atom, the N atom distant from the S atom, and the S atom beside Mn–N4, as shown in Figs. S2 and S3. Atomic structure configuration diagrams of different adsorption sites before and after structure optimization revel that the O2 molecules are physically adsorbed at both C atom and S atom sites (without the formation of OC/OS bonds), transforms into chemical adsorption on N site (distant from the S atom) as a Mn atom, and not adsorbed at the N atom near the S atom (break down into two O atoms). The calculation results show that the adsorption energies of O2 on these non-metal sites are 0.738, −3.558, −1.517 and 0.617 eV, respectively. To further elucidate the interaction mechanism between Mn–N–S–C and O2 molecules, a projected crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (pCOHP) analysis about MnO bonds in O2-adsorbed configurations was performed, as illustrated in Fig. 1b [26,27]. The hybridization features between Mn-d and O*-p orbitals determine the adsorption strength of OO* intermediates, which directly affects the catalytic performance [28,29]. Quantitative analysis of orbital hybridization integrals between Mn-d and O*-p orbitals (summarized in Table S1) reveals that the MnO interaction primarily originates from three distinct orbital contributions of 3dy z-2px , 3d z 2 -2py , and 3dx z-2px [30]. This indicates that S-doping plays a role by altering the interaction characteristics of these orbitals. Density of states (DOS) analysis further confirmed that S shifts the d-band center of the Mn site in Mn–N–S–C far from the Fermi level (from −0.91 eV in Mn–N–C to −1.12 eV in Mn–N–S–C, Fig. 1c). The electron occupancy numbers calculated from DOS integrals for Mn 3d-orbital of Mn–N–C and Mn–N–S–C on E – E F < 0 eV are 5.06 and 5.02, respectively (Table S2). The slight decrease in the number of electrons (Δ = −0.04e−) indicates that S-doping causes a weak charge transfer. This change indicates that the electronic structure of the Mn site is modulated by S-doping, thereby affecting its adsorption and activation ability with reactants. Meanwhile, Mn–N–S–C (0.143 eV) demonstrates a significant reduction in *OH adsorption energy compared with Mn–N–C (0.007 eV, Fig. 1d), highlighting the beneficial effects of S-doping on optimizing adsorption properties and enhancing catalytic performance. In the side views of *OH absorbed on Mn–N–C and Mn–N–S–C (Fig. 1e), when *OH is absorbed on Mn–N–C, the OMn bond length is 1.828 Å. In contrast, the OMn bond length on S-doped Mn–N–S–C increases to 1.830 Å. The increase in bond length indicates a decrease in the adsorption strength of *OH on the Mn–N–S–C surface, which is consistent with the changing trend of adsorption energy. This effect eventually allows Mn–N–S–C to exhibit a lower reaction energy than Mn–N–C, as demonstrated by the free-energy profiles of the ORR process (Fig. S4). The (O2 → *OOH) and (*OH → OH−) steps demonstrate thermodynamically uphill behavior. The energy barrier for the desorption of the *OH intermediate to form OH− is lower on Mn–N–S–C than on Mn–N–C (1.087 eV vs. 1.223 eV). It suggests that S atoms change the electronic properties of the active, specifically manifested as reducing the charge of the Mn atom, thereby promoting the easier release of *OH during the ORR process and further reducing the ORR energy barrier. The reduction of this energy barrier represents the fundamental reason why S-doping has a positive impact on ORR activity in the second nearest neighbor coordination environment. Specifically, S-doping optimizes adsorption properties by modulating the electronic structure of the active sites, ultimately improving ORR performance. 2.2 Synthesis and structural characterization 2.2.1 Assembly mechanism of Mn–N–S–C catalysts Mn–N–S–C electrocatalysts are achieved via a precisely engineered molecular assembly process (Fig. 2 a and Fig. S5). This geometric arrangement of precursor, characterized by the strategic positioning of ligands and a specific coordination number of Mn ions, is pivotal for promoting the assembly into a chain or layered structure. The second nearest neighbor coordination S-doping strategy is essential to this procedure, playing a crucial role in regulating the electronic configuration of the Mn–N x sites. The key to the molecular assembly is OH from α-cellulose and NH2 derived from guanidine hydrochloride and thiourea. Guanidine hydrochloride dissolves in water and breaks down to form urea and amines, supplying NH2 groups. The OH and NH2 groups form macromolecular structures through hydrogen bonding, which helps to confine Mn2+ in the macromolecular network structure [31]. Meanwhile, Mn2+ can be coordinated with N atoms that have lone pair electrons on the amino group, forming Mn2+ (NH2 CS) x /Mn2+ (NH2) x complexes. This process provides the foundation for doping S into the vicinity of Mn sites. Significantly, the two N atoms are positioned flanking the S atom in the thiourea molecule, resulting in a molecular geometry where the N and S atoms are in close spatial proximity. This geometric arrangement of thiourea facilitates the precise doping of S atoms adjacent to the Mn–N x active sites. Given that S possesses a lower electronegativity than N, it is typically formed by the bonding of N with Mn, which further avoids the possibility that S will directly coordinate with Mn. Afterward, S atoms at the second nearest neighbor coordination are further formed during the calcination process. This can be demonstrated in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum analysis graph (Fig. S6). The method realizes the precise control of S-doping position by rationally designing molecular assembly and elaborately arranging the spatial arrangement of atoms. It can provide references for doping other heteroatoms to optimize the electronic configuration of Mn active sites to enhance ORR. 2.2.2 Structural characterization The morphological structure of Mn–N–S–C was analyzed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). In Fig. 2b, Mn–N–S–C displays a distinct three-dimensional porous architecture, which facilitates the transport of oxygen intermediates via multiple pathways. This structural feature effectively reduces the reaction pathway length and accelerates reaction kinetics [32,33]. To investigate the impact of S incorporation on material morphology, the microstructures of Mn–N–C, N–S–C and N–C were analyzed. Mn–N–C also exhibits porous structures, but its pore size is marginally smaller than that of Mn–N–S–C, suggesting S atoms can enlarge the pore size of carbon materials (Fig. S7a). Analysis of the FE-SEM images of N–S–C and N–C reveals that incorporating S atoms effectively improves the pore architecture of catalysts (Fig. S7b, c). The well-developed porous morphology provides a continuous conductive framework, enhancing the conductivity of carbon materials and promoting rapid charge transfer. Further analysis of the microstructure of Mn–N–S–C was conducted using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mn–N–S–C showcases a typical graphite-like layered structure with thin and non-stacked carbon layers. No aggregation related to Mn species is observed, indicating the good dispersity of Mn atoms. It suggests that introducing Mn atoms does not disrupt the carbonaceous substrate (Fig. 2c). Mn–N–C also displays a porous structure (Fig. S8). The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of Mn–N–S–C shows an irregular pore size distribution on the carbon substrate (Fig. 2d). Aberration-corrected high-angle angular dark field-scanning TEM (AC HAADF-STEM) image reveals individual bright spots representing single Mn atoms, which are uniformly distributed throughout the carbon matrix. This uniform dispersion demonstrates that the molecular assembly approach contributes to high atomic dispersion of Mn atoms (Fig. 2e). Dark field-scanning TEM (DF-STEM) combined with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) images detect significant signals of Mn, O, S, N and C, indicating successful doping of Mn, N and S (Fig. 2f). XRD and Raman spectroscopy were employed to analyze Mn–N–S–C, Mn–N–C, N–S–C and N–C materials, examining their phase composition and structure. XRD patterns reveal that two peaks emerge near 26° and 43°, associated with the (002) and (101) planes of graphitic carbon (PDF#75-1621), indicating high graphitization of the materials (Fig. 3 a) [34,35]. No characteristic peaks related to Mn were observed in the XRD spectra, indicating that Mn may be doped into the carbon lattice in the form of atoms [25,36]. The intensity of the 002 peak rises with the incorporation of Mn and S, suggesting that co-doping of Mn and S contributes to enhancing the graphitization of carbon materials [36,37]. Raman spectroscopy was employed to examine surface structure and assess the graphitization level of graphitic carbon in four materials. The D and G bands exhibited prominent signals located at 1382 and 1584 cm−1, reflecting structural defects and the graphitization degree of carbon materials (Fig. 3b) [38,39]. The I D/I G ratio served as an indicator of the defect density and graphitization level in carbon materials [40]. Mn–N–C exhibits an I D/I G value of 1.02, while Mn–N–S–C shows a higher value of 1.05, indicating that S-doping reduces the graphitization intensity [41]. Meanwhile, the I D/I G value N–C is 0.98, which is lower than Mn–N–C, indicating that the incorporation of Mn increases the defect level of the material. Therefore, co-doping with Mn and S resulted in the carbon material with the highest level of structural defects/disorders among the samples studied, which are believed to play a crucial role in enhancing its electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, these defects may create a higher density of active sites favorable for the target reaction and modify the electronic structure of the carbon matrix, improving charge transfer or reactant adsorption. This can be reflected in the improved current density and half-potential for the Mn–N–S–C electrocatalyst [41]. N2 absorption–desorption measurements were used to investigate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore structure of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3c, the typical IV-type shape with H4 hysteresis loops indicates the coexistence of micropores and mesopores [42,43]. A sharp rise in the isotherms at low relative pressure (p/p 0 < 0.05) indicates a high microporous content across all samples [44,45]. Calculations based on desorption isotherms reveal that Mn–N–S–C has a BET surface area of 889.22 m2 g−1, significantly greater than those of Mn–N–C (726.06 m2 g−1), N–S–C (808.22 m2 g−1) and N–C (741.79 m2 g−1, Table S3). The pore size distributions of the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. S9. For Mn–N–S–C, the pore size is primarily centered at approximately 2.6 nm, indicating the presence of both micropores and mesopores. Relative to Mn–N–C, N–S–C and N–C, Mn–N–S–C exhibits a larger micropore volume, which is advantageous for ORR catalysis. Additionally, Mn–N–S–C possesses a typical porous topography composed of micropores and mesopores, which guarantees efficient mass transfer and increased active sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to examine the chemical bonding and atomic states of the materials. Fig. S10 presents the comprehensive XPS survey spectra for Mn–N–S–C, Mn–N–C, N–S–C and N–C catalysts. The element compositions of all four catalysts are detailed in Table S4. Due to the relatively low doping levels of S and Mn, their signals are weak in the full spectra. The co-doping of Mn and S can be confirmed by high-resolution XPS analysis of Mn 2p and S 2p. In Mn–N–S–C catalyst, distinct signals for C, N, O, S and Mn are detected, with atomic percentages of C (85.18 at%), N (8.78 at%), O (5.64 at%), S (0.13 at%) and Mn (0.25 at%), suggesting the effective incorporating of Mn, N and S. The Mn atomic content (0.25 at%) in Mn–N–S–C is comparable to that in Mn–N–C, indicating similar Mn–N x site densities in these two catalysts. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was tested to further confirm the content of Mn in Mn–N–S–C, which is about 1.853 wt% (Table S5). The C 1s spectra of all catalysts exhibit four peaks at 288.9, 286.4, 285.2 and 284.8 eV, assigned to CO, CO, CN/CS and CC groups, respectively (Fig. 3d) [46,47]. This indicates that all catalysts have comparable carbon levels and chemical characteristics, suggesting no significant structural differences in the carbon matrix. N 1s spectra of four catalysts display peaks located around 398.2 eV, 398.6 eV, 399.9 eV, 400.9 eV and 402.8 eV, corresponding to pyridinic–N, Mn–N x , pyrrolic–N, graphitic–N and oxidized–N, respectively (Fig. 3e) [48]. In contrast, N 1s spectra of NSC and NC predominantly feature graphitic–N and pyridinic–N bonds. Notably, graphitic–N is critical in enhancing the electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix, thereby contributing to improved current density in ORR evaluations [16,44]. Pyridinic–N coordinates with Mn atoms, providing effective catalytic active sites for ORR [14]. N 1s spectra of Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C reveal Mn–N x signals at 399.1 eV, signifying the existence of Mn–N x active centers. These abundant active sites facilitate catalytic activity, thereby augmenting ORR activity for Mn–N–S–C. Meanwhile, the O 1s spectra of Mn–N–S–C are deconvoluted into three distinct components: a peak at 531.4 eV corresponding to CO, a peak at 532.4 eV assigned to CO, and a peak at 533.8 eV attributed to adsorbed O (Fig. S11) [49]. The incorporation of S does not cause a shift in the C 1s and O 1s peak positions. Mn 2p spectra show peaks for Mn2+ (654.43 and 641.38 eV) and Mn3+ (655.32 and 642.48 eV) (Fig. 3f) [24]. Detailed analysis of the relative content of Mn2+ and Mn3+ in Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C is provided in Table S6. Relative to Mn–N–C, Mn–N–S–C exhibits an increased Mn3+ proportion, demonstrating that S incorporation promotes Mn oxidation via charge depletion [50]. Additionally, Fig. 3g corroborates the successful incorporation of S into the catalyst structure. The content of S atoms was determined to be 0.18% by elemental analysis (EA, Table S7). S 2p spectra show three characteristic peaks at 163.61 and 165.15 eV, attributed to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 in Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C [27,51]. Notably, XPS analysis reveals no evidence of MnS bond in Mn–N–S–C, indicating the absence of direct MnS coordination, which aligns with the molecular assembly mechanism discussed in this study. 2.3 Electrocatalytic ORR performance To optimize the synthesis conditions for Mn–N–S–C, various sulfur sources (thiourea, thioacetamide, L-cysteine) were tested. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) setup was employed to evaluate the ORR activity of the resulting catalysts (Fig. S12). The experimental outcomes demonstrate that Mn–N–S–C synthesized with thiourea as the sulfur source exhibited the highest limiting current density (J L) along with the most favorable half-wave potential (E 1/2). Therefore, thiourea is identified as the optimal sulfur source for fabricating Mn–N–S–C electrocatalysts under the investigated conditions. Further optimization of the synthesis conditions for Mn–N–S–C was conducted. When the cellulose dosage is 1.25 g, the CH6ClN3 dosage is 3.00 g, the Mn2+ salt dosage is 0.5 mmol and the thiourea dosage is 0.3 mmol, the Mn–N–S–C achieves optimal electrocatalytic performance (Fig. S13). Additionally, the effects of temperature, duration of vacuum rapid calcination, and ammonia treatment temperature were optimized. The optimal conditions were found to be a vacuum rapid calcination temperature of 1000 °C for 10 min, followed by pyrolysis treatment in ammonia at 800 °C, under which Mn–N–S–C exhibits superior E 1/2 and J L (Fig. S14). The electrocatalytic efficiency of Mn–N–S–C towards ORR was assessed in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte. The LSV curves help to identify its highest positive onset potential (E onset) and E 1/2 for Mn–N–S–C. Specifically, Mn–N–S–C demonstrated an E onset of 1.041 V and E 1/2 of 0.913 V, obviously exceeding those of Mn–N–C (E onset = 1.024 V, E 1/2 = 0.890 V), N–S–C (E onset = 0.999 V, E 1/2 = 0.874 V), N–C (E onset = 0.998 V, E 1/2 = 0.881 V) and Pt/C (E onset = 1.021 V, E 1/2 = 0.878 V). These findings highlight the greater ORR performance of Mn–N–S–C. Further evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of Mn–N–S–C was conducted by analyzing its J L, which reached 5.63 mA cm−2. This value surpasses those of Mn–N–C (5.53 mA cm−2), N–S–C (4.38 mA cm−2) and N–C (4.65 mA cm−2) and approaches 20 wt% Pt/C (5.78 mA cm−2). The higher E 1/2 of Mn–N–S–C compared to Mn–N–C confirms the significant enhancement in ORR performance after S-doping. Tafel slope analysis further demonstrated the outstanding ORR activity of Mn–N–S–C. With a Tafel slope of 73.12 mV dec−1, Mn–N–S–C exhibited the smallest value among the tested catalysts, outperforming Mn–N–C (74.07 mV dec−1), N–S–C (84.52 mV dec−1), N–C (75.24 mV dec−1) and 20 wt% Pt/C (86.50 mV dec−1, Fig. 4 b). It demonstrates a faster electron transfer rate during the ORR process. Overall, Mn–N–S–C demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity, surpassing previously documented Mn–N–S–C catalysts (Table S8). Compared to other comparison samples, Mn–N–S–C represents excellent catalytic performance, underscoring the beneficial effect of co-doping Mn and S-doping in enhancing catalytic activity. The current density of Mn–N–S–C increases with escalating electrode rotation rates, suggesting that the observed activity is strongly influenced by O2 diffusion. The K-L plots (inserted in Fig. S15) show excellent linearity, indicating that the initial reaction kinetics occur on Mn–N–S–C. By testing and comparing the LSV curves of the materials across various electrode velocities, the average electron transfer number ( n ¯ ) of the catalysts was determined by K-L calculations. The electrochemical oxygen reduction current densities of Mn–N–C, N–S–C, N–C and 20 wt% Pt/C increase with increasing electrode speed (Fig. S16). K-L calculations reveal the n ¯ values for Mn–N–C, N–S–C, N–C and 20 wt% Pt/C are 3.88, 3.68, 3.45 and 4.05, respectively. These results indicate that all catalysts have high 4e− selectivity in electrochemical ORR processes. To further assess the ORR performance, electron transfers number (n) and hydrogen peroxide yield (H2O2%) are calculated. RRDE measurements were employed to directly determine n and H2O2% (Fig. 4c and Fig. S17). The n values for the blank-control group, Mn–N–S–C, Mn–N–C, N–S–C, N–C and 20 wt% Pt/C are 3.98, 3.99, 3.97, 3.97 and 3.99, respectively. Mn–N–S–C exhibits a superior 4e− transfer pathway. Mn–N–S–C exhibits a low H2O2% of 2.57%, which is significantly lower than the other three samples and comparable to 20 wt% Pt/C. These findings further prove the exceptional performance of Mn–N–S–C. The kinetic activity of Mn–N–S–C was evaluated by calculating the capacitance (C dl) values from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves recorded at varying scan rates (Figs. S18 and S19). Mn–N–S–C demonstrated a maximum C dl value of 117.20 mF cm−2, surpassing Mn–N–C (110.24 mF cm−2), N–S–C (89.53 mF cm−2), N–C (53.12 mF cm−2) and Pt/C (27.55 mF cm−2, Fig. 4d). It indicates that Mn–N–S–C possessed a more extensive electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which facilitates catalytic reaction and enhances oxygen transport within the porous carbon skeleton. The greater ECSA of Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C catalysts is attributed to exposing many active sites, promoting the adsorption and desorption of O2, and ultimately enhancing ORR activity. Furthermore, the mass activity of Mn–N–S–C is measured to be 27.76 A g−1 cat at 0.85 V, higher than Mn–N–C (18.58 A g−1 cat), N–S–C (10.59 A g−1 cat) and N–C (13.53 A g−1 cat, Fig. 4e). This further indicates that the second nearest neighbor coordination S atom is advantageous for enhancing the catalytic performance for Mn–N–S–C. The toxic experiment is conducted using KSCN as the toxic reagent to prove abundant Mn–N x active sites of Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C. After adding KSCN, the Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C exhibit a significantly negative shift in E 1/2 and a markedly decrease in J L (Fig. S20). This experimental result directly proves that there is abundant Mn–N x active sites in Mn–N–S–C and Mn–N–C catalysts. Simultaneously, the CV cycle stability test indicates that after 10000 CVs, the redox peak potential shift of Mn–N–S–C is less than 30 mV, indicating the good stability (Fig. S21). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of reveals that Mn–N–S–C exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance than Mn–N–C, indicating facilitated charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface and enhanced electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S22). In the low frequency region, the slightly higher diffusion impedance of Mn–N–S–C suggests potential differences in ion diffusion or reaction kinetics. This might be due to the structural characteristics or surface morphology of the catalyst after S-doping. Besides studying the catalytic activity and kinetic properties, the long-term durability was also comprehensively tested. After 12 h i-t test, the current retention rate of Mn–N–S–C is 94.4%, which is better than the Mn–N–C (88.8%), N–S–C (81.2%), N–C (84.0%) and 20 wt% Pt/C (88.55%, Fig. 4f). The higher current retention rate of Mn–N–S–C under identical testing conditions underscores its remarkable stability during the electrochemical ORR process. Following chronoamperometric stability testing, XPS analysis revealed bonding configurations: CC (284.8 eV), CN/CS (286.2 eV), and CO (286.4 eV) peaks remained stable, confirming structural integrity of the carbon framework (Fig. S23a). The peak areas of graphitic–N, pyridinic–N, and Mn–N x showed no significant decrease, demonstrating the exceptional stability of active sites under ORR conditions (Fig. S23b). The CS bond exhibited minimal shift (< 0.2 eV), indicating robust S-doping (Fig. S23c). Concurrently, enhanced oxygen adsorption at 533.2 eV (O 1s) signified surface hydroxylation (Fig. S23d). These results confirm that S-doping stabilizes the Mn–N–S–C coordination environment, mitigates oxidative degradation, and underpins its superior durability relative to Mn–N–C. Based on the experimental and theoretical analysis, the exceptional ORR performance for the Mn–N–S–C catalyst could be ascribed to several critical factors: (1) The uniform dispersion of Mn atoms as isolated single atoms within the carbon matrix maximizes atomic utilization efficiency and increases the availability of active sites for ORR catalysis. (2) The introduction of the S atom at the second nearest neighbor coordination regulates the local microenvironment of Mn–N x active sites. This regulation weakens the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates on the Mn site and enhances the dissociation efficiency of *OH, thus enhancing the overall ORR efficiency of Mn–N–S–C. (3) The three-dimensional carbon skeleton, doped with S and incorporating Mn–N x sites, provides efficient pathways for oxygen diffusion and multi-electron transfer. This architectural feature accelerates ORR kinetics and significantly enhances both the durability and ORR activity of the catalyst. 3 Performance of assembled zinc-air battery 3.1 Liquid zinc-air battery To assess the electrocatalytic ability of Mn–N–S–C in ZABs, liquid ZABs were assembled using Mn–N–S–C, Mn–N–C, N–S–C, N–C and 20 wt% Pt/C (Fig. 5 a). As illustrated in Fig. 5b, the ZABs constructed with Mn–N–S–C demonstrate a smooth operation at an open circuit voltage of 1.54 V, exceeding Mn–N–C (1.53 V), N–S–C (1.51 V), N–C (1.52 V) and 20 wt% Pt/C (1.49 V). Fig. 5c presents the discharge polarization curves and peak power density plots for five catalysts when used as air cathodes in ZABs. Mn–N–S–C-based ZAB achieves a power density of 209.8 mW cm−2, outperforming Mn–N–C-based ZAB (196.5 mW cm−2), N–S–C-based ZAB (153.4 mW cm−2) and N–C-based ZAB (175.3 mW cm−2) and 20 wt% Pt/C-based ZAB (114.0 mW cm−2). Consistent with the electrochemical performance analysis for ORR, the power density of N–S–C is not improved after doping S into N–C, while the ORR performance of Mn–N–S–C shows significant improvement. This indirectly indicates that solely doping S atom into the carbon material does not contribute to the catalytic ORR. However, by regulating the electronic configuration of Mn sites and changing the MnO bond length, the adsorption capacity on Mn sites can be enhanced, thereby accelerating ORR. Compared with recently reported performance of liquid ZABs with S-doped M−N−C electrocatalysts as air cathodes, Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs demonstrate superior power density ( Table S9). The specific capacity of Mn–N–S–C-based ZAB at 20 mA cm−2 is 734.01 mA h g−1, exceeding Mn–N–C (660.57 mA h g−1), N–S–C (640.51 mA h g−1), N–C (649.39 mA h g−1) and 20 wt% Pt/C-based ZABs (601.25 mA h g−1, Fig. 5d). Then, the Mn–N–S–C-based liquid ZAB can undergo mechanical charging by replacing the depleted anode with a fresh zinc electrode [52,53]. After five cycles of mechanical charging, the discharge voltage of the battery remained stable and the capacity did not show a significant decline (Fig. S24). The long-term cycling stability of Mn–N–S–C-based ZAB was evaluated by charge–discharge testing at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5e). Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs have good cyclic stability and their cycle reversibility and voltage gap remain stable after 800 h constant current charge–discharge test. The round-trip potential difference is measured at 1.0 V. However, Mn–N–C-based, N–S–C-based and N–C-based ZABs show rapid voltage fluctuations after 618, 407 and 523 h, respectively. By contrast, the voltage gap of Pt/C-based ZABs exceeds 1.2 V within 109 h, significantly inferior to Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs. Compared to most reported liquid ZABs with S-doped M−N−C electrocatalysts as air cathode, Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs demonstrate superior cycle life. These findings highlight that Mn–N–S–C has exceptional anti-polarization ability and long-term stability during the charge–discharge cycle, and has a broad application prospect in ZABs. 3.2 Quasi-solid-state zinc-air battery To assess the catalytic efficacy of Mn–N–S–C, a quasi-solid-state ZAB was conducted using Mn–N–S–C as the cathode catalyst, with the structural schematic depicted in Fig. 6 a. Initial testing of the open circuit voltage for the quasi-solid-state ZABs reveals values of 1.54 V for Mn–N–S–C, 1.52 V for Mn–N–C, 1.49 V for N–S–C, 1.52 V for N–C, and 1.52 V for 20 wt% Pt/C. All prepared catalysts exhibit an open circuit voltage of approximately 1.5 V. The Mn–N–S–C electrocatalysts display the highest open circuit voltage (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c presents the charge–discharge polarization curves of five catalysts. The quasi-solid-state ZABs based on Mn–N–S–C demonstrate the smallest charge–discharge voltage gap, indicating favorable charge–discharge performance. Moreover, the power density of the Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs is 34.05 mW cm−2, higher than those of Mn–N–C (26.02 mW cm−2), N–S–C (22.9 mW cm−2), N–C (20.9 mW cm−2) and Pt/C (21.8 mW cm−2, Fig. 6d). Fig. 6e presents the specific capacity measurement evaluated at 5 mA cm−2. The specific capacity of Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs reaches 728.7 mA h g−1, surpassing those of Mn–N–C (687.3 mA h g−1), N–S–C (608.6 mA h g−1), N–C (557.1 mA h g−1) and Pt/C (658.3 mA h g−1). Fig. 6f shows the discharge test results at different current densities. After multi-current discharge, Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs can still maintain the initial discharge potential. The final discharge potential of Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs was higher than ZABs with the other four catalysts. Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs demonstrated better magnification capability when considering the voltage output across different current densities. To evaluate its cyclic stability, a charge–discharge cycle test was performed at 2 mA cm−2. The results indicate that Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs maintained a charge and discharge voltage gap of 0.50 V after 23 h of continuous cycling. However, the quasi-solid-state ZAB used Pt/C catalyst as the air cathode has a larger voltage gap of 0.8 V and a shorter lifespan of only 15 h (Fig. 6g). Additionally, quasi-solid-state ZABs composed of Mn–N–C, N–S–C and N–C showcase charge–discharge cycle durations of 19 h, 6 h and 13 h, respectively. Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs exhibit a smaller voltage gap of 0.6 V compared to the Mn–N–C-based ZAB. It is also indicated that the introduction of the S atom effectively reduces the voltage gap during the cycle, which is more conducive to energy conversion efficiency. The above test results show that Mn–N–S–C held great potential for quasi-solid-state ZABs application. 4 Conclusions The molecular assembly method was employed to successfully synthesize the Mn–N–S–C electrocatalyst, achieving precise S-doping into the second nearest neighbor coordination of the Mn site. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced ORR activity is attributed to the altered charge distribution within the Mn–N x active sites due to introducing S atoms at the second nearest neighbor coordination. This adjustment in electronic structure optimizes the d-band center of Mn sites, which bolsters the desorption of the *OH intermediate and reduces the energy barrier for the ORR process. The Mn–N–S–C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with an E 1/2 of 0.913 V. The peak power density of liquid ZABs based on Mn–N–S–C reaches 209.8 mW cm−2. Additionally, Mn–N–S–C-based liquid ZABs showcase a specific capacity of 734.01 mA h g−1 and achieve a cycle life of approximately 800 h at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZAB has a specific capacity of 728.7 mA h g−1 and maintains a cycle life of about 23 h at 2 mA cm−2. This work offers novel perspectives into the design of single-atom catalysts and highlights the importance of precisely regulating the local microenvironment of catalytically active sites to enhance ORR performance.

        "dc:description": "Regulation of the second nearest neighbor coordination atoms is a potent strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of manganese-nitrogen-carbon (Mn–N–C) catalysts with Mn–N4 sites. However, precisely regulating the second-nearest neighbor coordination environment of the Mn site is still challenging. Here, a novel approach is proposed to modulate the local microenvironment of Mn–N4 sites by strategically doping sulfur (S) atoms at the second nearest neighbor coordination positions to address this challenge. Density functional theory calculations elucidate that S-doping at these positions significantly alters the charge distribution of the Mn site, inducing a downshift in the d-band center of Mn. This electronic modulation weakens the binding strength of the Mn site toward the *OH intermediate, thereby reducing the energy barrier for the ORR process. To experimentally realize this concept, the strategic molecular assembly approach is employed to precisely incorporate S atoms into the second nearest neighbor coordination of the Mn site, resulting in the construction of the manganese-nitrogen-sulfur-carbon (Mn–N–S–C) catalysts. The Mn–N–S–C showcases a favorable half-wave potential of 0.913 V. When integrated into rechargeable liquid zinc-air batteries (ZABs) the Mn–N–S–C-based ZABs deliver high power density of 209.8 mW cm−2 and stable cycling performance for 800 h. Furthermore, Mn–N–S–C-based quasi-solid-state ZABs exhibit a power density of 34.05 mW cm−2 and a cycle life of 23 h. This study highlights the importance of the second nearest neighbor coordination atoms in tuning the electronic structure of single atom active sites, proposes a method to enhance ORR efficiency through atomic-level engineering, and demonstrates the practical application of the Mn–N–S–C catalyst in high-performance energy storage systems. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principles for next-generation catalyst design and support advancements in energy conversion and storage technologies.",
