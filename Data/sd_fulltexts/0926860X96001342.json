Independent of nickel loading in the zeolite, regeneration in hydrogen alone was not sufficient to restore the initial activity. Regeneration in air/hydrogen cycles was more successful for catalysts with higher Ni loadings, but structural transformations of the metal particles occurred during the oxidative regeneration process. Temper- ature programmed reduction (TPR), photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FTIR of adsorbed CO have been used to identify these modifications.

Introduction Nickel is widely used in industry as a methanation, steam reforming and hydrogenation catalyst. During reaction, these catalysts may be deactivated due to the formation of coke or hydrocarbonaceous residues. Compared with the hydrogenation of other hydrocarbons or CO, this deactivation is particularly rapid in the case of benzene. Deactivation of the metal component for supported nickel catalysts has been widely reported and it is consistent with the formation of a reversible and an irreversible form of adsorbed benzene. Subsequent poisoning of the nickel component may depend on the adsorption strength of the carbonaceous material and also on its reactivity with hydrogen [1]. The hydro- genation of benzene has been widely studied for Ni zeolites [2-10] and a 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(96)00 134-2 308 B. Pawelec et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 deactivation with time-on-stream observed [4,5,10]. The use of a zeolite as a support may lead to further complications in determining deactivation mecha- nisms as while the metal function promotes the hydrogenation reaction, the acid function (also generated during reduction) catalyses skeletal isomerisation and alkylation reactions which may lead to coke formation [2,3]. Deposition of coke or carbonaceous residues results in a decrease in catalytic activity due to the loss of active phases, surface area and diffusivity in catalysts [11]. Generally, the coking process is determined by the acidity and zeolite pore structure [12], and deactivation occurs in zeolites with large pores (HY), for which the reactions leading to coke formation are not limited by steric constraints [13]. Deactivation is also dependent on operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, time- on-stream, and nature of the reactant [14-16]. Previous studies attributed deactivation of Ni/Y during the low temperature hydrogenation of benzene to pore plugging as a result of formation of cyclohexylbenzene and dicyclohexyl- benzene [3], whereas regeneration studies indicate a degree of structure sensitiv- ity implying metal deactivation for Ni-USY [10]. A number of reviews covering various aspects of deactivation in zeolites have been published [13,17] but less attention has been given to the chemical and structural changes which occur within zeolitic catalysts as a result of regenera- tion treatments. As with deactivation, regeneration is a shape selective process [18] and depends on the zeolite type and active phase. An effective regeneration method for Ni-USY catalysts needs to restore the catalyst activity, which means removal of coke deposits without altering the catalyst structure. Light hydrocar- bons may be removed by treatment in hydrogen but oxidation treatments may be required for removal of coke. Cycles of oxidation/reduction may lead to redispersion or sintering of supported metals according to the choice of treat- ment temperature [19]. For Ni/Y catalysts deactivated during benzene hydro- genation regeneration of catalysts by burning off occluded coke restored and, in certain cases, raised the catalytic activity which was attributed to a redispersion of the Ni phase [4]. However, as particle size measurements were made by XRD, these probably refer to large particles located at external surfaces of the zeolite. Ni-USY zeolites display lower ion-exchange capacity, less uniform pore system and contain extra framework alumina when compared to ion-exchanged Ni/NaY zeolites, leading to the possibility of further interaction between Ni and the zeolite or the extra framework alumina during such oxidation treatments. The present study was undertaken to identify the influence of hydrogen and air/hydrogen regeneration treatments on the active phases in Ni-USY zeolites used in benzene hydrogenation [10]. In addition to comparing the activity of fresh and regenerated Ni-USY catalysts, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), XPS analysis and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO were used to study catalyst modifications. All these techniques are useful tools for identifying the nature of Ni sites involved in this reaction and also to reveal the morphological changes of the active sites induced by the regeneration processes. B. Pawelec et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 309 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The zeolite supported catalysts were prepared from the original ultrastable HY (USHY) zeolite. The characteristics of this zeolite are as follows: SiO2/A1203 mol ratio 5.6, Na20 content 0.14 wt.-% and unit cell 2.454 nm. Ni-USY catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange following impregnation from an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)24H20 (Merck, reagent grade). The ion-ex- change was carried out using a volume ratio of solution to zeolite of 20:1, at constant temperature (333 K), and maintained with constant stirring for 24 h. After ion-exchange the samples were repeatedly washed with 50 cm3 distilled water; then the liquid was decanted and the solid dried in air at 383 K for 4 h and then calcined at 723 K in air for 2 h. For enhanced nickel content after ion-exchange the catalysts were impregnated by pore filling and the excess water slowly removed in a rotary evaporator until dryness. The solids were then dried in air at 383 K for 4 h and calcined at 723 K for 2 h. The catalysts are designated 5.0 Ni and 9.0 Ni with the number indicating the %Ni in the water-free zeolite. 2.2. Characterisation techniques Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted using a Micromeritics 3000 analyser. 50 mg of sample were heated at 10 K/rain to 673 K in a flow (50 cm3 rain-1) of 10 vol.-% Hz/Ar and maintained at 673 K for 1 h. Samples were then reoxidised at 673 K in 10 vol.-% OJHe before being treated under similar TPR conditions, but this time being allowed to reach a final temperature of 1173 K. X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded using a Fisons Escalab 200R with a MgKa X-ray source (hv= 1253.6 eV), operating at 12 kV and 10 mA. The used and regenerated catalysts were collected from the reactor in isooctane to prevent oxidation by air and then pressed into small Inox cylinders and mounted onto a manipulator which allowed the transfer from the preparation to the analysis chamber. Fresh catalyst samples were firstly reduced in situ at 673 K for 1 h, and then pumped out to 10-5 Torr (1 Torr = 133.33 N m 2) before being moved into the analysis chamber. The residual pressure in this ion-pumped chamber was maintained below 7. 10-9 Torr during data acquisition. Spectral regions of interest were scanned a number of times to obtain good signal-to-noise ratios. Binding energies (+ 0.2 eV) were determined by charge referencing to the Si 2p line at 102.5 eV. Infrared spectra were recorded of samples in the form of self-supporting wafers of about 10-12 mg/cm2 thickness. Fresh samples were reduced in situ in a hydrogen flow at 673 K for 2 h. Used samples were outgassed at 423 K and 310 B. Pawelec et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 then either reduced for 2 h in hydrogen at 673 K or oxidised in a flow of air for 1 h at 673 K prior to reduction in hydrogen for 2 h at the same temperature. Reduced samples were outgassed in high vacuum for 0.5 h, and then cooled to room temperature. They were subsequently exposed to 30 Torr CO and the IR spectra recorded using a Nicolet ZDX spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm-i. The IR spectra presented were obtained by subtracting a background spectrum of the sample obtained prior to CO adsorption. Catalytic tests were carried out under atmospheric pressure in an automatic microcatalytic flow reactor [10]. The reactant c6n6 (99.95% vol.) and H2 (99.98% vol.) were fed without diluent at a H2/C6H6 molar ratio of 34 and at a W/F 80 g h mol-~. The feed gases were mixed in a heater at a constant temperature of 373 K before entering the reactor. The reactor temperature was measured by a thermocouple placed in a well within the catalyst bed. The catalysts were sieved in the mesh range 0.50-0.42 mm with 0.5 g used for each experiment. For these particle sizes a gas flow-rate of 75 cm3 (STP)/min was sufficient to avoid external mass resistance from the reacting gases to the catalyst surface. The fresh, calcined catalysts were prereduced for 2 h at 673 K in a flow of hydrogen, followed by cooling to a reaction temperature. The reaction was followed for 2 h at 423 K with the reactor effluents sampled via a microvolume sampling valve and injected in to a Konik-3000 HR gas chromato- graph equipped with a FID detector, using a 15% diethylene glycol succinate on Chromosorb-W column at 333 K and helium carrier at a flow rate of 20 cm3/ min. The catalysts used in reaction were either regenerated in H2 at 673 K or firstly in air at 673 K for 1 h followed by reduction in H2 for 1 h at 673 K. Regenerated catalysts were tested under the same reaction conditions as fresh catalysts. 3. Results 3.1. Characterisation Bearing in mind the limitation of the BET method to zeolites [20] isotherms for both catalysts and the support were measured and indicated a decrease in pore volume following incorporation of Ni with this decrease being greater for the highest loaded sample. This confirms the incorporation of Ni into the internal structure of the zeolite. The diffraction patterns of the calcined catalysts and USHY zeolite confirmed that the zeolite structure was not altered during the preparation procedure. The diffraction pattern of NiO was observed only in the case of the 9.0 Ni catalyst. Diffuse reflectance spectra of both catalysts displayed a main band at 260 nm due to tetrahedrally coordinated nickel(II) complexes, and two other bands at 420 nm and 720 nm, typical for octahedral symmetry, and of octahedral 0.020\" 0.015 0 0,010 0.005 g .2 = o.ooo 0 \"~ 0.020 ,., 0.015. 0.010. 0.00.~ 0.000 B.

Intensities of the bands were proportional to the Ni2+ content of the samples. 3.2. Catalytic activity Catalyst activity expressed as the rate of benzene hydrogenation as a function of the time-on-stream for the fresh prereduced 9.0 Ni and 5.0 Ni samples and those regenerated in H2 and in air/H2 are shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, respectively. Cyclohexane was the only hydrocarbon product detected. The fresh 9.0 Ni catalyst is much more active than the lower loaded sample. The common characteristic of both profiles is the rather fast deactivation, in particular for the higher loaded sample, which agrees with the trend observed earlier for Ni-ex- changed Y zeolites [4]. The close similarity between the initial activity level for 312 B. Pawelec et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 the fresh and air/hydrogen regenerated 9.0 Ni catalyst suggests that this treatment is effective in reversing the cause of deactivation (Fig. 1A). Regenera- tion in H2 alone does not appear effective (Fig. 1A). For the 5.0 Ni catalyst neither hydrogen alone nor an air/hydrogen cycle are effective in returning the initial activity (Fig. 1B). Regenerated catalysts show a similar loss of activity as a function of time-on-stream as the fresh catalysts. 3.3. IR studies of CO adsorption In order to determine the nature and relative abundance of exposed nickel atoms at the catalyst surfaces and to elucidate the effect of both regeneration treatments on the catalysts, the FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO were recorded. Spectra for the 9.0 Ni catalyst are reported as representative of both samples. Spectra for the reduced fresh catalyst, and for used catalyst regenerated in hydrogen or in an air/hydrogen cycle are shown in Fig. 2A. The spectra of the reduced sample showed bands at 2215, 2198, 2144, 2130(sh) and 2100 cm-j, which were detected for the unreduced catalyst [10], together with very intense bands at 2055 and 1996 cm-J and a weak broad band at 1860 cm-~. The small band at 2215 cm-~ may be assigned to CO adsorbed on A13+ cations in the zeolite [10,23] and the peak at 2198 cm-~ to CO weakly adsorbed on exposed Ni2+ ions [23-25]. A band at 2144 cm-1 is also observed for CO physically adsorbed on nickel-free NaY and KY zeolites [24,25], and is therefore ascribed to CO weakly held at centers within the zeolite. The band at 2090 cm-1 was observed in reduced NiY zeolites and ascribed to NiCO complexes [5]. Weakly adsorbed CO, giving a band between 2070-2090 cm-I, has been reported for Ni/Al203 and attributed to CO held by isolated Niatoms or at Ni sites adjacent to oxygen atoms or oxide support [23]. The most likely explana- tion is that zeolite containing higher concentration of nickel contain NiO crystallites, which are stabilized against complete reduction in hydrogen. The band at 2100 cm-~ may therefore be attributed to CO adsorbed at nickel in a partially oxidised state (Ni~+) in the zeolite. The most dominant features in Fig. 2A are the intense bands at 2055 cm ~ and 1990 cm-J indicative of linearly and two fold bridge bonded CO, respectively [26,27]. A weaker band at 1860 cm-~ may be assigned to CO adsorbed at three-fold bridging sites. The H2 and air/H~ regenerated 9.0 Ni catalysts (Fig. 2A b, c) do not display bands at 2215, 2198 or 2144 cm-~ leaving a well resolved maximum at 2130 cm ~. The band at 2100 cm-1 is much less intense and forms a high frequency shoulder on the 2055 cm-~ maximum. The most apparent differences in the region below 2100 cm-1 are the general increase in intensity of bands assigned to CO adsorbed on top and on two fold bridging sites and the loss in resolution between bands due to these species following regeneration. The spectrum of used catalyst regenerated in an air/hydrogen cycle is similar to the sample regenerated in Hz alone although the band at 1990 cm-1 increased markedly, B.

To determine whether the intermediate oxidation step was responsible for the observed spectral changes, a similar oxidation/reduction cycle was performed using a fresh prereduced 9.0 Ni catalyst which had not been used in reaction. 314 B.

Spectra of the 9.0 Ni catalyst subjected to a reduction-oxidation-reduction cycle are compared with the spectrum of the reduced fresh catalyst in Fig. 2B. Bands due to CO on two fold bridging and on-top sites were more intense for the sample treated by oxidation/reduction cycle but the band at 1860 cm-] due to adsorption at three fold bridging sites was absent. This increased intensity may be due to an increase in dispersion during oxidation/reduction cycles, as observed by IR and volumetric adsorption studies on other systems [19]. Unlike samples which had been used in reaction, further treatments in air/hydrogen cycle did not result in the loss of sites giving bands at 2215, 2198 and 2144 cm-l or lead to a loss in intensity of the band at 2100 cm-1. 3.4. IR studies of used and regenerated catalysts IR spectra of the catalyst after use in reaction and after regeneration have been recorded to identify the nature of the species present at each of these stages. Spectra in the region 1700-1300 cm-~ for the fresh catalyst, and for the used catalyst at various stages of regeneration are shown for the 9.0 Ni sample in Fig. 3. The used catalyst after outgassing at 423 K shows three intense bands at 2929, 2855 and 1451 cm-1, which are due to the presence of cyclohexane retained in the zeolite pores following reaction, and less intense maxima at B. Pawelec et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 315 1620, 1590, 1487 and 1358 cm-~ (Fig. 3b). Although deactivation preventing diffusion of cyclohexane from the internal cavities has been attributed to the generation of cyclohexylbenzene and dicyclohexylbenzene [3], only very weak bands above 3000 cm-~ due to unsaturated hydrocarbon species were detected and these remained irrespective of the regeneration treatment. Both regeneration procedures at 673 K were sufficient to remove the cyclohexane and the species giving the band at 1487 cm-~ although a broad band at 1460 cm-~ was detected in place of the latter feature when treated in an ox/red cycle. Regeneration in H2 alone lead to an increase in intensity of the 1590/1358 cm-I band pair along with the appearance of a band at 1505 and the 1620 cm band became a shoulder at ca. 1607 cm- 1 (Fig. 3c) Following oxidation/reduc- tion regeneration treatments a broad intense feature at 1600 cm 1 dominated the spectrum with maxima at 1450 and 1358 cm ~ still present. Similar maxima have been previously observed on deactivated catalysts and assigned to either carboxylate or carbonaceous species [28-30]. 3.5. Temperature programmed reduction TPR was used to monitor the formation of metallic nickel from the precursor stage and to identify structural changes induced by the reduction/oxidation cycle. TPR may be used to determine the location of Ni2+ sites within the zeolite [31] with the relative ease of Ni2+ reduction decreasing in the order: supercages > sodalite cages > hexagonal prisms [32]. The TPR profiles of 5.0 Ni and 9.0 Ni up to 673 K followed by 1 h under isothermal conditions are shown in Fig. 4A. The profile of HUSY showed no peaks due to H2 consumption under similar conditions. Samples show maximum at 636 (5.0 Ni) and 673 K (9.0 Ni) which can be attributed to reduction of NiO particles located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals and supercages [33]. From the relative peak areas, it is clear that the amount of reducible NiO is greater for the 9.0 Ni sample (Fig. 4A a), while the shift of 37 K to higher temperatures would indicate relatively larger NiO crystals for this sample, consistent with their detection by XRD. After 50 min at 673 K no further H2 consumption was observed indicating the pretreatment conditions used in other techniques to be adequate in obtaining equilibrium conditions at this tempera- ture. Fresh catalyst samples which were heated to 1173 K (not shown) showed reduction peaks at ca. 790 and 1053 K, indicating that unreduced Ni is still present in catalysts following the pretreatment and reaction conditions chosen. The TPR profiles for samples after reduction/oxidation cycles at 673 K are similar for both samples with maxima at 547, 783 and 1032 K for 5.0 Ni and 554, 807 and 1022 K for 9.0 Ni (Fig. 4B). The low temperature peak may be assigned to reduction of NiO, while the intermediate temperature signal 780-810 K) is assigned to reduction of Ni2+ in sodalite cages to Niand Ni~ + as observed for NiNaX zeolites [33]. The high temperature peak at ca. 1030 K may 316 B. Pawelec et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 J S 1 .

Although the quantity of Ni located in the latter sites would appear similar for both samples, the quantity of Ni in other environments is clearly higher for the higher loaded sample, judging by the relative H2 uptakes. 3.6. Photoelectron spectra XPS was used to determine the nature of nickel species in regenerated and fresh catalysts. The Ni 2p3/2 core level spectra of 5.0 Ni and 9.0 Ni zeolites, used in reaction and then regenerated in H2 and in air, are shown in Fig. 5 with binding energies summarised in Table 1. Deconvolution of the Ni 2p3/2 peak shows that regenerated catalysts possess three components with binding energies at ca. 853.4, 856.5 and 863 eV. Binding energies were similar in both samples and independent of the method of regeneration. All spectra exhibit shake-up satellite structure due to Ni2+ ions at ca. 7 eV to the high binding energy side of the main peak. The peak at 853.4 eV is due to reduced nickel. However, a B.

As in the case of HY, the USY zeolite exhibits very strong Br~insted acid sites, and it is possible that electron charge from small Ni clusters to these H+ sites occurs leaving slightly electron-deficient Ni. The relative contributions of peaks at 853.4 and 856.5 eV (Table 1) indicate that regeneration of a given catalyst in hydrogen or in air does not significantly alter the proportion of reduced/unreduced nickel at the surface. The C 1 s core level spectra shows components at 284.9 and ca. 286.3 eV, associated with carbonaceous and C-O species, respectively. The proportion of the former to the latter species remains constant between used and air treated catalysts but decreases for both catalysts when treated in hydrogen. Quantitative analysis (Table 2) reveals that the C/Si atomic ratio is rather high in both used catalysts and that air or H2 treatments at 673 K remove only a small, and equivalent part of the carbon containing material. These facts indicate that following regenera- tion carbon containing entities are retained by the catalyst (Table 2) but the partially oxidised C-containing species represent a greater proportion of the total following treatment in hydrogen. Used catalysts show a decrease in Ni/Si ratio although this was recovered and actually enhanced following regeneration in air for both catalysts. Although redispersion by oxidation is a common occurrence in many supported metal catalysts [19], this enhancement in the Ni/Si ratio was particularly apparent in the case of the 5.0 Ni catalyst. As XPS is sensitive to the outer surfaces, the increase in the Ni/Si ratio for this sample may be related to the transfer of Ni to the external surface of the zeolite during regeneration. Hydrogen treated samples both indicated lower Ni/Si ratios than in the used catalyst. 4. Discussion As previously observed [10], Ni-USY catalysts exhibit a fall in activity as a function of time-on-stream during low temperature benzene hydrogenation. The B. Pawelec et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 319 possible deactivation mechanisms include: (i) poisoning of metal sites, (ii) plugging of available void space by deposition of carbonaceous residue and (iii) sintering of the active phases [37]. For benzene hydrogenation over Ni-USY catalysts the former two mecha- nisms, and particularly type (i), are probably responsible for catalyst deactiva- tion. Loss of nickel surface area by sintering would appear the least likely given the low reaction temperature used although loss of metal area during regenera- tion treatments cannot be immediately ruled out. However, it is likely that the reaction is taking place over a limited number of active sites throughout the catalyst. IR spectra indicate an increase in intensity of bands due to reduced Ni following regeneration treatments indicative of an increase in metal dispersion [19]. It has been shown previously [10] that only catalysts exhibiting such adsorption sites were active in the reaction. However, the increase in available sites did not lead to increased activity in the regenerated catalysts compared with the fresh catalyst, indicating that not all sites are actively involved in the reaction. A first indication from the IR spectra of the regenerated catalysts would suggest the gain in intensity of bands due to CO on reduced centres is due to a more complete reduction of the nickel resulting from the additional reduction treatment and leading to the loss of bands in the spectrum above 2130 cm-1. Nickel in the reduced/reoxidised catalysts is more easily reduced than in the fresh calcined catalyst as indicated by the shift in the first TPR peak of ca. 100 K to lower temperature. However the detection of IR bands above 2130 cm-1 for unused catalysts following a similar reduction-oxidation-reduction cycle would indicate that an increase in the degree of reduction is not responsible for the loss of these features. This is confirmed by XPS where the relative percentages of Ni/Ni2are not significantly altered by the regeneration treat- ments. TPR profiles of reduced and re-oxidised samples also confirm the presence of Ni species which are not reduced by treatments up to 673 K. The loss of IR features above 2130 cm-1 and their assignment to CO adsorbed at unreduced Ni sites and sites within the zeolite would indicate that although these may not be active in the hydrogenation reaction [10] they do become covered by some species produced during reaction or during the regeneration process, lone et al. [5] report the loss of a band at 2145 cm-~ in the presence of benzene and a loss of intensity at 2110 cm-1, but no effect on a band at 2200 cm-~. The presence of carbonaceous residues on the reduced metal sites might be expected to have two effects. The first would result in the loss in intensity due to reduced number of adsorption sites and the second would result in a shift of the maxima for CO bands due to the dilution of the surface and a decrease in the number of dipole-dipole interactions. Neither of these is observed and the only indication that the catalyst has been in contact with the reactants is a loss in resolution between the two main bands and the relative increase in intensity of the lower frequency maximum. This effect was not observed following 320 B. Pawelec et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 red/ox/red cycle for samples which were not used in reaction (Fig. 2B). A loss rather than gain in the ratio of bridging/linear carbonyls would be expected should carbonaceous residues be present as a diluent of the metal surface. IR spectra of the sample after removal from the reactor and outgassing and after regeneration treatments exhibit maxima in the 1600-1300 cm-1 region. These bands correspond with maxima previously observed for deactivated samples and assigned to either carboxylate or carbonaceous species [28-30]. Although a degree of controversy exists over the exact assignment [30] it appears that carboxylate species with bands at 1580 and 1460 cm-~ are formed over supports containing basic hydroxyl groups whereas carbonaceous species with bands at 1591, 1458, 1394 and 1378 cm-~ are observed for zeolite materials with acidic hydroxyls [38]. The latter three bands were attributed to CH deformation modes of CH2 and CH3 indicating that the hydrocarbonaceous residue retained a high H/C ratio. Such an assignment is rejected here on the basis that such species would give rise to more intense stretching modes in the 3000-2800 cm i range which were not observed here. Blackmond et al. [29] observed bands at 1585 and 1378 cm-~ for 1-hexene reacting over HY zeolite and attributed the 1585 cm-~ peak to a highly carbonaceous coke species, but did not indicate which vibrational mode this represented. It should be noted that laser Raman studies of coked zeolites also display bands at 1600 and 1350 cm- [39] which are consistent with maxima at 1575 and 1355 cm-~ in Raman spectra of graphitic and pre-graphitic carbon, respectively [40,41]. However, as these bands are due to the E2g (graphite) and A ~g (Raman active only for small crystallites) modes which are not IR active, the bands observed by Blackmond and others [28-30] cannot be due to this type of carbon. Bands in the spectrum below 1700 cm-~ become dominant after heating at 673 K in a gas flow and after removal of the trapped cyclohexane. Previous TPO studies indicate that specific parts of the coke become oxidised to give anhydride and ketonic species between 573 and 723 K [28] or that between 673 to 773 K weight losses occur which indicate removal of the carbonaceous deposits [4]. The treatment at 673 K here therefore falls within a range where carbonaceous material may be modified by the reagent gases, as shown by the development of IR bands in Fig. 3, and where some removal of the species occurs as indicated by the drop in C/Si ratios by XPS. The detection by infrared spectroscopy of Cx species on the catalyst surface after regeneration treatments and the assignment to CH and CO containing entities is consistent with the detection of both types of species by XPS in regenerated samples. It should be stressed that whatever assignment is given to these bands, these species are not responsible for the deactivation of the catalysts. Weak bands due to formate species were observed for the deactivated, used catalyst (Fig. 3b), but bands due to these species and others were enhanced during regeneration treatments, although similar regeneration treatments for the catalyst in the reactor was sufficient to recover the initial catalytic activity, at B. Pawelec et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 307-322 321 least in the case of 9.0 Ni. This is consistent with the high C/Si ratios measured by XPS on regenerated catalyst samples and the fact that these treatments only marginally reduced the C/Si ratios of the used catalysts. It is clear that the carbon containing species which remain following regener- ation treatments are located primarily on the support surface and as such do not participate or impede the hydrogenation reaction which proceeds on the metal function of the catalyst. Minor quantities of the oxygenated species exist on the catalyst during reaction but they are principally formed during the regeneration treatments at higher temperatures. The presence of these species within the zeolite structure is inferred as responsible for the inhibition of CO adsorption giving bands above 2100 cm-1 in the regenerated catalysts. The fall in activity as a function of time-on-stream is attributed to accumulation of an irreversibly adsorbed form of benzene which is not readily removed from the metal sites by hydrogenation, but may be oxidised in air at 673 K. Removal of this layer may recover the initial activity of the fresh catalyst, but a progressive build up of the strongly adsorbed benzene leads to a similar deactivation profile as observed for the fresh catalyst. 5. Conclusions Ni-USY catalysts are slowly deactivated as a function of time-on-stream during benzene hydrogenation. IR bands typically assigned to carboxylates and carbonaceous material are observed during regeneration treatments but these are not responsible for the observed deactivation. Air/hydrogen treatment may recover the initial catalyst activity but fails to remove all carbonaceous residues from the catalyst. These treatments lead to a change in the nature of the metallic phase and a migration of nickel to external surfaces of the zeolite. Acknowledgements J.A.A. has a Royal Society Research Fellowship.
