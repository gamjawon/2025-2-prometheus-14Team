The generation of free radicals in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) typically relies on external substances and energy, which significantly hinders their scalability and cost-effectiveness in wastewater treatment. Developing additive-free AOPs is essential for efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment. Herein, a new strategy for advanced oxidation is demonstrated, in which dissolved oxygen is directly activated to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) without oxidants or energy input, achieved with a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co-CAT-3). This strategy delivers remarkable degradation efficiency, exceeding the performance typically reported for conventional AOP systems. As a representative case for kinetic and reactive free radical species involved in organic degradation, a model organic compound, methylene blue, was used to evaluate degradation performance, which revealed a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.2916 min−1 and a catalytic capacity of ∼0.61 μmol mg−1. The proposed strategy also exhibited efficient catalytic activity toward structurally diverse organic pollutants, including representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and tetracycline (TC), persistent drug carbamazepine (CBZ), endocrine-disrupting compound bisphenol A (BPA), azo dye methyl orange (MO), and small-molecule industrial intermediate maleic anhydride (MA), underscoring its universality and practical applicability. This work provides a new paradigm for additive- and energy-free ROS generation, thereby enabling efficient pollutant degradation.

Many countries have established regulations and discharge standards for wastewater, but reducing pollutant concentrations in industrial effluents to meet these standards requires complex treatment processes and significant energy input [1,2] . The concentration of pollutants in wastewater is mainly reduced through strategies such as adsorption, biodegradation, membrane separation, and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Among them, AOPs are widely used due to their high efficiency, universality, and environmental protection [3]. The key step of classic AOPs is the generation of free radicals. There are two common methods to obtain free radicals. (i) Excitation of highly active precursors, such as H2O2, O3, Cl2, ClO2, etc. The application of H2O2 in wastewater treatment typically requires concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mM to sustain sufficient oxidative capacity. This often corresponds to dosages tens of times higher than the pollutant concentration, significantly elevating reagent consumption and treatment cost, which is impractical in large-scale, low-cost wastewater treatment scenarios [4,5] . The high reactivity of O3 can lead to the corrosion of critical system components such as pipelines, valves, pumps, and sealing elements during prolonged exposure, and its toxicity to humans necessitates sealed operational environments and temporary isolation measures to prevent hazards [6]. Due to its low solubility and limited mass transfer in water, O3-based treatment requires extended contact durations and continuous dosing, which not only elevate operational costs but also lead to the accumulation of residual O3. When its concentration exceeds Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) exposure limits (0.1 ppm), additional gas removal units are required to ensure safety [7,8] . These combined factors substantially impede the implementation of ozonation in water treatment applications. The use of Cl2 and ClO2 in wastewater treatment poses significant secondary pollution risks due to their intrinsic toxicity and the potential formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts [9]. These limitations collectively constrain the practical deployment of oxidant-dependent AOPs in real wastewater treatment. (ii) The activation of low-reactivity precursors (such as O2 and H2O) through external energy inputs including electricity, light, or ultrasound to generate ROS constitutes a primary strategy in current AOPs. Among these strategies, electrochemical AOPs have attracted considerable attention due to their versatility and operational controllability. However, they require substantial electrical energy to activate low-reactivity precursors (such as O2 and H2O) for ROS [10]. Representative systems such as electro-Fenton (EF), electro-coagulation (EC), and electro-oxidation (EO) have been reported to require 81.51, 36.55, and 21.35 kW h m−3, respectively, running at full power [11,12]. Photocatalytic AOPs, valued for their environmental friendliness and mild operating conditions [13]. Nonetheless, several intrinsic drawbacks considerably restrict their widespread deployment. Although light penetration depths in transparent media can reach several tens of centimeters, this depth is significantly reduced in real wastewater due to turbidity and coloration, which severely substantially curtails the effective irradiation volume [14,15]. This attenuation imposes critical constraints on practical application. Ultrasound-driven AOPs leverage acoustic cavitation to generate localized high-energy microenvironments capable of inducing radical formation [16]. This requirement for specialized high-power equipment and substantial maintenance results in elevated operational costs and poses significant challenges to system scalability and long-term reliability [17,18]. Collectively, the dependence on external energy input, the requirement for specialized infrastructure, and limited performance in realistic wastewater environments fundamentally restrict the scalability and practical viability of energy-driven AOPs. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention due to their high atom utilization efficiency, uniform coordination environments, and well-defined catalytic sites. These structural characteristics enable SACs to offer superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticle-based catalysts, while also minimizing metal usage [19]. In the context of wastewater treatment, SACs are primarily employed to facilitate the generation of ROS for the degradation of organic contaminants. Current research on SACs for water treatment has largely focused on energy-driven AOPs, including photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. For example, Fe-, Co-, and Mn-based SACs have been used to activate H2O2 under light or electric fields, promoting the formation of ROS such as ·OH, ·O2 -, and 1O2 for pollutant degradation [20,21]. These systems typically exhibit higher degradation efficiency, accelerated reaction kinetics, and improved stability compared to their nanoparticle counterparts. However, the continued generation of ROS in these systems often depends on a combination of external energy and added chemical oxidants. This reliance increases operational complexity and cost, while also compromising broader applicability. In light of these constraints, the development of SAC systems that enable ROS generation under ambient conditions without external energy or chemical additives remains a significant and largely unmet challenge. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that directly activates dissolved oxygen to produce ROS, enabling efficient degradation of organic pollutants without the need for additives or energy by exploiting the high catalytic activity of a cobalt single-atom catalyst. Using methylene blue (MB) as a model pollutant, the Co-SAC catalyst exhibits exceptional performance, highlighting its potential for practical, sustainable wastewater treatment. Nearly complete degradation of MB (10 μM) was achieved within 30 min at a catalyst dosage of 0.1 mg mL−1, yielding a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.2916 min−1. This kinetic performance surpasses that of most reported advanced oxidation catalysts under comparable conditions using MB as the model pollutant (generally <0.15 min−1), even in the presence of external oxidants or energy input [22–24]. The corresponding catalytic capacity reaches approximately 0.61 μmol mg−1, which is more than twice that of conventional nanoparticle- and oxide-based systems (typically <0.3 μmol mg−1) [25–27]. To the best of our knowledge, such an additive- and energy-free ROS generation strategy has not been previously reported. This work marks a notable step toward the development of rapid, efficient, and convenient water treatment technologies, and provides a solid basis for continued progress in sustainable environmental remediation. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals The chemicals used in this study were employed without further purification.

Methyl alcohol was purchased from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Co., Ltd (China). 2.2 Synthesis of BZIF In a typical synthesis [28,29], Co(NO3)2·6 H2O (4.0 mmol, 1.164 g) and Zn(NO3)2·6 H2O (36.8 mmol, 10.948 g) were dissolved in 20 mL of methanol to form a clear solution, labelled as solution A. 2-methylimidazole (0.16 mol, 13.14 g) was dissolved in 20.0 mL of methanol labeled as Solution B. Then, Solution A and Solution B were thoroughly mixed and stirred at room temperature for a further 12 h. The resulting purple precipitate was centrifuged and washed several times with methanol followed by drying overnight at 60.0 °C for further use. The bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (BZIFs) were generated and named BZIF-3 based on the amount of Co and Zn input. Similarly, BZIF-1, BZIF-2, BZIF-4, BZIF-5 and BZIF-6 were also synthesized according to the same procedure with Co/Zn molar ratios of 0.16:40.64, 0.8:40, 6:34.8, 12:28.8 and 16:24.8, respectively. 2.3 Synthesis of Co-CAT The BZIF as a precursor was transferred to a tube furnace and heated under a nitrogen flow at a rate of 5.0 °C min−1 to 950 °C and maintained for 3 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature. The resulting products were collected and labeled as Co-CAT-1, Co-CAT-2, Co-CAT-3, Co-CAT-4, Co-CAT-5 and Co-CAT-6, according to precursor. 2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation Catalytic degradation experiments were carried out using methylene blue (MB, 10.0 μM) as the model pollutant. In a typical procedure, 1.0 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 10.0 mL of MB solution in a 50 mL reaction tube. The suspension was stirred at a constant rate for 30 min. No addition of external energy or oxidants was introduced during the experiment. Thereafter, 2.0 mL aliquots were collected every 5 min and directly transferred into a 10 mm quartz cuvette. The residual concentration of MB was determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (UV-2550 Shimadzu, Japan) based on its absorbance at 662 nm. Degradation experiments for other organic pollutants were conducted under identical conditions. Each pollutant solution (10.0 mL) containing 1.0 mg of catalyst was stirred for 30 min and sampled at 5 min intervals. The initial concentrations were as follows: carbamazepine (CBZ), bisphenol A (BPA), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TC), methyl orange (MO), and maleic anhydride (MA). Residual concentrations were determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry at their respective maximum absorbance wavelengths. All experiments were performed three times, and the results are expressed as mean values with standard errors. 2.5 Catalytic membrane purification system assessment 58.9 mg Co-CAT-3 powder was ultrasonically dispersed in water and vacuum filtered through a 0.2 μM polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to obtain a catalytic membrane with 5.0 cm diameter and 3.0 mg cm−2 loading. In the single-pass filtration mode, an MB solution with an initial concentration of 10.0 μM was passed through a modified PTFE ultrafiltration membrane (5.0 cm in diameter) at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at room temperature. The MB concentration was also determined using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. All experiments were performed three times, and the results are expressed as mean values with standard errors. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Design and characterization of BZIFs as precursors Due to the similar crystal structures of Zn-ZIF (ZIF-8) and Co-ZIF (ZIF-67), it has been reported that BZIF is synthesized by coordination of Zn2+ and Co2+ with 2-methylimidazole [30–32]. Based on this, we envision regulating the ratio of Zn2+ and Co2+ in BZIF and then pyrolyzing it. The dispersion state of Co in the obtained product will change with the Co2+ content in BZIF ( Fig. 1a). The obtained BZIFs are named BZIF-1 to BZIF-6 according to the Co2+ content (Table S1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate that the addition of Co2+ did not significantly change the morphology and size of BZIF (Fig. 1b). There is no obvious change in X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of BZIF-1 to BIZF-6, proving that they belonged to the same crystal form and the addition of Co did not affect the crystallization process (Fig. S1a). After pyrolysis under a nitrogen atmosphere, the diffraction peaks associated with the ZIF structure disappeared from the spectrum of products named Co-CAT-1 to Co-CAT-6 (Fig. S1b), and a broad peak emerged at around 2θ= 26°, which is characteristic of amorphous or partially graphitized carbon [33]. This indicates the collapse of the original crystalline framework and the formation of a disordered carbon matrix. TEM images further revealed that the Co-CATs retained most of their original polyhedral morphology (Fig. 1c), particularly in Co-CAT-1 to Co-CAT-3. At low Co contents (e.g., Co-CAT-1), Co atoms were uniformly dispersed without any observable nanoparticles. However, with increasing Co2+ content, the dispersion state of Co evolved from isolated atomic species to aggregated metallic nanoparticles. At high Co2+ loading (e.g., Co-CAT-4), Co nanoparticles began to form, as evidenced by particle crystallization and aggregation. This structural transformation was further corroborated by XRD spectra (Fig. S1b). Low Co content samples exhibited amorphous features without discernible Co peaks. As the Co2+ content increased, distinct diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Co gradually appeared. They are assigned to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of Co and are clearly observed in Co-CAT-4, Co-CAT-5, and Co-CAT-6, confirming the formation of crystalline Co nanoparticles. It can be inferred that Co-CAT-3 is the product with the highest Co content without aggregating Co particles. The evolution of the porous structure was also investigated using N₂ adsorption-desorption isotherms ( Fig. S2a ). The BZIFs precursor maintained high specific surface areas (approximately 1500–1800 m2 g−1), whereas the surface areas of Co-CATs decreased with the increasing of Co content, from 1056.3 m2 g−1 to 602.9 m2 g−1 ( Table S2 ). This was due to the formation of dense Co particles that occupy the mass and volume of the original carbon skeleton. It can be further observed from the pore size distribution curve that the main peaks of the BZIFs were located at around 0.52–0.54 nm ( Fig. S2b ). In contrast, the pore size distributions of the Co-CATs were narrower, and the average pore size was slightly smaller (about 0.36–0.38 nm), which reflected that the carbon skeleton was denser during the pyrolysis process and the pore structure had shrunk to a certain extent. The Co content in different samples did not have a significant effect on their pore size distribution. 3.2 Morphological and structural analysis High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images indicate that the BZIF-3 precursor exhibits well-defined lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 1.20 nm, corresponding to the (110) crystal plane ( Fig. 2a) [34]. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveals distinct single crystal diffraction lattice (Fig. 2b). Upon pyrolysis, the HRTEM images reveal a primarily amorphous carbonaceous framework (Fig. 2c), and the SAED pattern confirms the loss of long-range order (Fig. 2d). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping reveals a uniform distribution of Co, Zn, N, and C in the precursor (Fig. S3) [35]. After pyrolysis, the nanoparticles indicated a uniform distribution of Co elements without obvious granular aggregation (Fig. 2e), indicating that Co atoms may exist in single atomic form. Notably, Zn plays a key role during pyrolysis by preventing Co aggregation, thereby facilitating the formation of isolated cobalt atoms. After that, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images reveal the presence of dense atomically dispersed Co atoms, highlighted by red circles, with no evidence of aggregated Co nanoparticles (Fig. 2f) [36]. This observation is consistent with the XRD patterns. In addition, the density of Co atoms in Co-CAT-3 was significantly higher than in Co-CAT-2 ( Fig. S4 ), indicating that the number of single-atom sites increased with higher Co loading [37]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to probe the chemical state of Co. For BZIF-3, the Co 2p spectrum displays binding energy peaks at 779.1 eV and 794.6 eV, corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 (Fig. 2g) [38], respectively, indicating that Co exists predominantly in the + 2-oxidation state. In contrast, the XPS spectrum of Co-CAT-3 exhibited only a Co 2p peak around 780.0 eV, with no signal attributable to Co0 (Fig. 2h), confirming that Co remains in an oxidized, non-metallic form [39–41]. The Co 2p XPS spectrum of Co-CAT-3 displayed relatively weak intensity with a lower signal-to-noise ratio compared with typical nanoparticle catalysts. This phenomenon can be attributed to the very low cobalt content exposed on the carbon surface. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis determined the cobalt content of Co-CAT-3 to be 3.94 wt%. To further investigate the oxidation state and local coordination environment of Co, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), was employed. The Co K-edge XANES spectrum of Co-CAT-3 indicates that the rising edge lies between those of CoO and Co3O4, and is closer to CoO, suggesting that Co atoms are in an oxidized state with an average valence between + 2 and + 3 (Fig. 2i) [42,43]. The k2-weighted Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum of Co shows a strong peak at ∼1.41 Å, corresponding to Co-N coordination [41]. No discernible peak is observed near 2.17 Å, confirming the absence of Co-Co interactions and excluding the formation of cobalt clusters, consistent with the XPS results [44–46]. To quantitatively assess the coordination environment, EXAFS curve-fitting is performed for Co-CAT-3. As shown in Fig. S5, the first coordination shell is best fitted with a Co-N shell, featuring a coordination number of 4 and a bond length of 1.88 Å [47]. The EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) plot further indicates no intensity maxima corresponding to Co-Co bonding in the R range of 2–3 Å (Fig. S6, Table S3) [48]. The maximum intensity appears at k ≈ 5 Å−1, matching the characteristic of Co-N coordination (Fig. 2k) [49,50]. The XPS spectrum of N 1 s provides complementary evidence, with the peak at 398.3 eV assigned to pyridinic N and the peak at 400.0 eV corresponding to Co-N coordination (Fig. S7) [51]. These findings, in conjunction with XAFS results, confirm that atomically dispersed Co atoms are anchored within a graphitized carbon matrix through the formation of Co-N4 coordination structures. 3.3 Catalyst activation performance To evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the prepared cobalt-based catalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants, a series of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy measurements were conducted using MB as the model substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a-f, the characteristic absorption peak of MB gradually weakened over time in the presence of Co-CATs, indicating that all Co-CATs effectively degraded MB. Among them, Co-CAT-3 demonstrates the highest activity (Fig. 3c, g), which is due to the fact that Co-CAT-3 contains the highest density of single-atom sites without Co particles. Furthermore, the catalytic degradation of MB followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, described by the equation ln(Ct/C0)= -kt, where C0 and Ct represent the MB concentrations at time zero and time t, respectively, and k is the apparent rate constant (min−1), indicating the reaction rate [52]. The kinetic experiments were conducted at a controlled temperature of 27.0 °C. For Co-CAT-3, the rate constant k was calculated to be 0.2916 min−1 (Fig. 3h), which outperforms most reported catalysts under comparable AOP conditions. In contrast, many existing systems require higher catalyst dosages, longer reaction times, or the addition of oxidants or aeration to achieve similar degradation efficiency ( Table S4 ). To assess the structural stability of the catalyst before and after catalysis, HRTEM and SAED images were taken on Co-CAT-3 after catalytic reaction (Fig. 3i, j). The morphology of Co-CAT-3 after MB degradation showed significant changes compared with its pristine state (Fig. 2e). This may be associated with edge dissolution under weakly acidic conditions (pH∼6.4) and slight migration or redistribution of Co sites. [53,54]. Furthermore, ICP-MS results indicate a slight detachment of cobalt after catalysis (0.3 μg L−1), which also confirms the cause of the morphological changes of Co-CAT-3. EDS mapping (Fig. 3k) revealed that Co and N elements remained uniformly distributed after the degradation reaction, without signs of aggregation. This confirms that cobalt atoms are firmly anchored in the carbon matrix and remain atomically dispersed during the catalytic process. To further assess the environmental safety of Co-CAT-3, the cobalt concentration in the solution was analyzed by ICP-MS before and after the catalytic reaction. According to the Emission Standard of Pollutants for Copper, Nickel, and Cobalt Industry [55] issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China, the discharge limit for cobalt is 1 mg L−1. In contrast, the Co content in the solution increased by only 0.3 μg L−1 after reaction, which is far below this threshold. This result indicates that cobalt leaching from Co-CAT-3 is far below the regulatory threshold and does not pose a risk of secondary pollution. 3.4 Free radical active species in MB degradation To investigate the role of dissolved oxygen in the solution, the reaction was conducted under a N2 atmosphere to deplete dissolved oxygen. Specifically, the MB solution was purged with high-purity N2 gas for 10 min prior to catalyst addition, effectively removing dissolved O2. While maintaining continuous N2 flow, 1.0 mg of Co-CAT-3 catalyst was promptly introduced, and samples were collected every 5 min using a gas-tight syringe for analysis by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Under these conditions, the catalytic activity of Co-CAT-3 was almost completely suppressed (Fig. S8a), indicating that dissolved O2 was essential for ROS generation and ruling out contributions from surface-adsorbed species or oxidant sources such as H2O. MB solution without catalyst did not degrade naturally at room temperature (Fig. S8b), and the pure Co-CAT-3 dispersion caused no obvious UV absorption (Fig. S8c). Additionally, to elucidate the reactive species involved in the degradation of MB by cobalt catalysts (Co-CAT-3) ( Fig. 4a), this study employed ESR spectroscopy (A300–10/12, Bruker, Germany) to directly monitor the generation of free radicals. DMPO and TEMP were used as spin-trapping agents for ·OH/·O2 - and ¹O2, respectively [56,57]. As shown in Fig. 4b-d, after introducing Co-CAT-3 into the reaction system, characteristic signals corresponding to hydroxyl radicals (·OH, DMPO-OH), superoxide anion radicals (·O2 -, DMPO-O2 -), and singlet oxygen (¹O2, TEMP-1O2) were clearly detected. The simultaneous appearance of these signals provides strong evidence for the generation of multiple ROS species during the catalytic process. To distinguish the individual contributions of these species, radical scavenging experiments were conducted using specific molecular quenchers: tert-butanol (TBA) for ·OH, 1,4-Benzoquinone (PBQ) for ·O2 -, and furfuryl alcohol (FFA) for 1O2. As shown in Fig. 4e, the introduction of TBA and PBQ only caused a slight inhibition of degradation efficiency, indicating that ·OH and ·O2 - both play auxiliary roles [58]. In contrast, the addition of FFA significantly inhibited MB degradation, confirming that ¹O₂ plays a dominant role in the degradation process. 3.5 Organic pollutant degradation by catalytic membranes To verify the practical applicability of Co-CAT-3, its catalytic performance was evaluated in a continuous-flow membrane system for long-term dye degradation. MB solution (10.0 μM) was continuously directed to a filtration device with a diameter of 5 cm for 60 h of catalytic degradation ( Fig. 5a). Co-CAT-3 maintained excellent catalytic activity in the continuous membrane system, effectively degrading MB under environmental conditions. Notably, the system achieved approximately 99 % degradation efficiency within the first 3000 min, with a slight decrease after 3600 min, which may be attributed to gradual surface fouling or catalyst deactivation. More importantly, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the treated effluent remained consistently below 60 mg L−1, meeting the discharge standard for industrial wastewater specified in the Discharge Standard of Water Pollutants for Dyeing and Finishing of Textile Industry [59], issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s Republic of China, as shown in Fig. 5b. To further evaluate the reusability of Co-CAT-3, cycling experiments were conducted by recovering and washing the catalyst after each run. As shown in Fig. S9, Co-CAT-3 maintained nearly unchanged degradation performance over six consecutive cycles, indicating that catalyst deactivation is negligible. Performing six cycles is a commonly adopted practice in catalysis research to assess stability [60,61], and these results confirm the excellent long-term stability and reusability of the catalyst under practical conditions. In addition to the flow reactor validation, the substrate generality of Co-CAT-3 was evaluated using a set of representative organic pollutants, including representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and tetracycline (TC), persistent drug carbamazepine (CBZ), endocrine-disrupting compound bisphenol A (BPA), azo dye methyl orange (MO), and small-molecule industrial intermediate maleic anhydride (MA) [62–67]. As shown in Fig. 5 c, Co-CAT-3 demonstrates strong degradation capacity for all tested compounds, as evidenced by the UV-Visible spectra over time ( Fig. S10 ) and rapid concentration decay curves. These results highlight the broad-spectrum applicability of Co-CAT-3 and further confirm its potential for treating various organic pollutants in real-world environments. 4 Conclusions In summary, a strategy was developed to directly activate dissolved oxygen for ROS generation, enabling efficient degradation of diverse organic pollutants without the need for additives. Multiple ROSs were produced, among which singlet oxygen (1O2) was identified as the predominant active species. The atomically dispersed Co1 sites were essential for catalytic efficiency, with activity increasing proportionally to site density. However, excessive loading of Co precursors induced aggregation into Co nanoparticles, leading to a decline in catalytic performance. The catalyst also exhibited excellent stability and activity under continuous-flow operation, demonstrating its suitability for practical water treatment applications. This study provides a promising, energy-saving and economical method for deep wastewater treatment and opens up new avenues for the practical application of additive-free AOPs.

        "dc:description": "The generation of free radicals in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) typically relies on external substances and energy, which significantly hinders their scalability and cost-effectiveness in wastewater treatment. Developing additive-free AOPs is essential for efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment. Herein, a new strategy for advanced oxidation is demonstrated, in which dissolved oxygen is directly activated to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) without oxidants or energy input, achieved with a cobalt single-atom catalyst (Co-CAT-3). This strategy delivers remarkable degradation efficiency, exceeding the performance typically reported for conventional AOP systems. As a representative case for kinetic and reactive free radical species involved in organic degradation, a model organic compound, methylene blue, was used to evaluate degradation performance, which revealed a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.2916 min−1 and a catalytic capacity of ∼0.61 μmol mg−1. The proposed strategy also exhibited efficient catalytic activity toward structurally diverse organic pollutants, including representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and tetracycline (TC), persistent drug carbamazepine (CBZ), endocrine-disrupting compound bisphenol A (BPA), azo dye methyl orange (MO), and small-molecule industrial intermediate maleic anhydride (MA), underscoring its universality and practical applicability. This work provides a new paradigm for additive- and energy-free ROS generation, thereby enabling efficient pollutant degradation.",
