Graphical abstract RhCl3 was heterogenized into renewable polysaccharide supports, and the effect of polysaccharide type on the new catalyst performances in a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction was studied. The conversion of the fresh iota carrageenan heterogeneous system (ἰ-RhCl3), was found to be the highest, whereas it was lower than the conversion of its homogeneous analogue. In addition, the ἰ-RhCl3 (catalyst loading of 6.5 % wt) was proven to be efficient heterogeneous catalyst that was easily recycled, whereas the conversion was increased in the first and second cycles. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) combining Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed, confirming that RhCl3 was embedded within the ἰ-carrageenan. The Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry of the heterogeneous ἰ-RhCl3 catalyst was compared to that of the native polysaccharide, and no new bands were detected. Nonetheless, a comparison of SEM image of ἰ-carrageenan with and without RhCl3, as well as rheological measurements of the aqueous solution of ἰ with and without RhCl3, indicated the incorporation of the polysaccharide with the RhCl3. Keywords Heterogeneous catalysts Polysaccharides Red algae Suzuki cross coupling 1 Introduction Transition metals have found numerous applications as catalysts, either in their metallic form or as the center of metal complexes [1–6]. The main reason for their excellent performance is that they can be in a variety of oxidation states, and easily interchange between these states, thus lend electrons or withdraw electrons from different reagents. As such, transition metals act by forming complexes with the reagent. Although many research groups have focused on preparation of very active and selective transition metal complexes (TMCs), only few industrial applications with TMCs are available. That is because homogeneous complexes suffer from several critical disadvantages, such as high price, unique handling requirements, difficult to reuse and recycle, and non-contentious mode operation. Therefore, heterogenization of these complexes, thus combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, could translate the power of homogeneous metal complex to industry [7,8]. In general, TMC heterogenization can be achieved via immobilization of the TMC to a support or its entrapment or occlusion in a support matrix [7,8]. The attachment can be accomplished via ionic or covalent bonds or electrostatic interactions, whereas entrapment is realized by proper matching between the TMC nature and the size of the support pores as well as the polarity of the reaction solvent. Various organic and inorganic supports can be used for this purpose, such as oxides [9,10] and polymers [11,12]. Many TMCs and especially those of palladium were found to be attractive catalysts for coupling reactions. Among all CC coupling reactions with a palladium catalyst, the Suzuki reaction of aromatic halides with phenylboronic acid is of major importance in organic synthesis and has drawn a lot of attention since it was first introduced 40 years ago [13–16]. The reaction can be catalyzed by different palladium metals, salts or complexes, and the addition of an organic or inorganic base is necessary to neutralize the forming acid due to the formal exchange of a hydrogen atom with the aryl group. Besides recycling of the catalysts, a major problem with the Suzuki homogeneous reactions is the formation of palladium metal, which is very difficult to recover. Thereby, heterogeneous supported palladium catalysts were also extensively studied especially on carbon support, but in most cases the activity and selectivity were much lower than the reaction with palladium salts or complexes and leaching of palladium was observed [17]. Heterogenization of palladium complexes in order to attain its recycling and recovery was also studied, using various methods [17–20]. Finally, since the introduction of the first palladium catalyst for the Suzuki reaction, many other metals were efficiently employed for the reaction including nickel [21–23], iron [24,25], copper [26] and rhodium [27–30]. Rhodium-based catalysts, which were found to be useful for the Suzuki reaction with halobenzens that bare also aldehydes and nitriles on their aromatic ring, were also used as nano- and micro-particles on different supports, yielding efficient heterogeneous catalysts [31–36]. We recently introduced a very easy and straightforward technique to immobilize TMCs in polysaccharide matrices [37–39]. The heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by simply mixing an aqueous solution of pallidum or rhodium salts with sodium triphenylphosphine trisulfonate (TPPTS) as a ligand, e.g., Pd(OAc)2(TPPTS)2, PdCl2(TPPTS)2, RhCl(TPPTS)3, with aqueous solution of polysaccharides, e.g., Carrageenan types iota (ἰ), kappa (κ), lambda (λ) xanthan-gum (x), followed by deep-freezing and lyophilization. The resultant xerogels, ‘sponge-like’ solid catalyst systems, were characterized by new linkage between the sulfonic acid sodium salt on the TPPTS ligand and the hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharide, as demonstrated by FTIR analysis, allowing catalyst recycling without leaching of the complex [37–39]. Due to their renewable origin, biodegradability and low toxicity, polysaccharides derived from natural sources, like cellulose, carrageenans and chitosan, have recently found a lot of applications in the pharmaceutical, biomedical products, cosmetic, food, and building blocks industries [40–44]. Various polysaccharides were also employed as supports for metal catalysts [45–49] and in particular as palladium [50–60] and rhodium [33] catalysts for Suzuki reaction, yielding heterogeneous and recyclable systems. As previously mentioned, rhodium and palladium complexes with TPPTS as ligand were immobilized to various polysaccharides, via the formation of a new sulfate ester, while simple palladium salts, i.e., PdCl2 and Pd(OAc)2, or palladium complex with triphenyl phosphine (TPP), i.e., PdCl2(TPP)2 and Pd(OAc)2(TPP)2, were leached to the reaction mixture [37,39]. In addition, it was found that addition of polysaccharides to homogeneous reaction mixtures with palladium salts [39] or complexes [37] increased the conversion rate. This enhancement effect could be explained due to the hydrophilic nature of the polysaccharides, i.e., hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharides supplied a water like environment that accelerates the reaction [61,62]. In contrary to the reactions with palladium, addition of a polysaccharide to the homogenous reaction with rhodium chloride resulted in a low conversion rate [39]. Hence, it was suggested that unlike palladium, rhodium itself can interact with the functional groups on the polymer backbone, and thus can be immobilized to the polysaccharide even without a ligand. In accordance with these former findings, this study focuses on elucidation of the rhodium-polysaccharides interaction and evaluating its potential to be used as heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki reaction. In this study we report for the first time the heterogenization of simple rhodium chloride (RhCl3), without any ligand, on various polysaccharides derived from natural sources. The new heterogeneous catalysts were used in the Suzuki cross-coupling of halobenzenes with phenylboronic acid together with sodium carbonate in ethanol (Fig. 1 ). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents and polysaccharide supports All chemicals (analytical grades) and polysaccharides were purchased from Aldrich Israel. 2.2 Heterogeneous catalyst preparation A typical procedure for heterogeneous catalyst preparation was performed as follows: First, 1 g of polysaccharide was dissolved in 100 ml DDW by heating the solution to 50 °C, and the mixture was then stirred for several hours until a homogeneous solution was obtained. Then 10 μmol RhCl3 was added to 3 ml DDW in a second vial, and mixed by vortexing for homogenization. Next, it was poured together with 3 ml of 1% wt/v of the polysacharide solution into a 15 ml polypropylene, sealed and mixed by vortexing for homogenization. The next step was to deep-freeze the tube at -20 °C for 24 h, until all the liquid was frozen. Then, the seal was removed and the tube was covered with a paraffin sheet pierced by a disposable toothpick. The tube was then lyophilized for 48 h. At the end of this process, the dried’ sponge-like ‘catalyst was cut into ∼ 1 cm × 1 cm pieces and added to the reaction mixture. 2.3 Reaction procedure In a typical procedure, 10 μmol of RhCl3 (homogenous or heterogeneous in the form of xerogel) were added to a vial with 5 ml ethanol together with 0.5 mmol halobenzene, 0.75 mmol phenylboronic acid and 0.6 mmol Na2CO3. The mixture was placed in a preheated oil bath at 60 °C and magnetically stirred for 24 h. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled. For cases in which a heterogeneous catalyst was used, the catalyst was removed by filtration. The organic phase was then analyzed to determine the reaction conversion by gas chromatography (GC) by using a HP-5 column. 2.4 Leaching tests Leaching of the catalysts was tested as follows: (1) performing a second reaction after the removal of the catalyst from the original reaction mixture and the addition of the catalyst to a fresh reaction mixture with the corresponding amounts of fresh substrates and sodium carbonate, then checking the catalytic performance; (2) proceeding with the reaction after the removal of the catalyst by running the reaction mixture under similar conditions for an additional 24 h, to check whether the conversion increases with time; and (3) by doing an inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Arcos, Spectro) analysis of the reaction medium after a 24 h reaction time and the removal of the catalyst, to check for rhodium leftovers in the solution. 2.5 Catalyst recycling Catalysts were recycled by adding the recovered catalyst to a solution with similar amounts of fresh substrates and base and then running the reaction mixture under similar reaction conditions for an additional 24 h. 2.6 FTIR analysis Lyophilized native ἰ and dried ἰ’ sponge-like ‘catalyst underwent Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis by using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR (Thermo Scientific, USA) spectrophotometer with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory outfitted with a diamond crystal. The recorded spectra were the means of 36 spectra taken in the 650–4000 cm−1 range with 0.5 cm−1 resolution and atmospheric correction applied at room temperature (25 °C). 2.7 SEM analysis The dried ἰ’ sponge-like ‘catalyst was previously coated with gold. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was performed on a FEI Quanta 200 (ThermoFisher). Acceleration voltage was 25 kW. 2.8 Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) Elemental analysis of the dried ἰ’ sponge-like ‘catalyst was performed by SEM on a FEI Verios 460 l XHR (extreme high resolution, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (EDS, Oxford Instruments). 2.9 Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) XPS data were collected using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer ESCALAB 250 ultrahigh vacuum (1·10−9 bar) apparatus with an AlKα X-ray source and a monochromator. The X-ray beam size was 500 μm and survey spectra were recorded with pass energy (PE) 150eV, and high energy resolution spectra were recorded with pass energy (PE) 20eV. To correct for charging effects, all spectra were calibrated relative to a carbon C 1s peak positioned at 284.8 eV. Processing of the XPS results was carried out using AVANTGE software. 2.10 Rheological measurements The viscosity of 0.5 % w/v aqueous solution of ἰ, with and without 10 μmol of RhCl3 (that were prepared as described above), was determined using HAAKE RotoVisco 1 (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an extended temperature cell for temperature control using stainless steel cone-and-plate (d =60 mm and θ = 0.5°). The samples were measured at T =25 °C as a function of the shear rate in an upward sweep from 1 to 1000 s−1. In addition Dynamic viscoelastic characterization of the samples was also determined by the frequency dependence (between 0.05−20 Hz) of the storage and loss moduli, G‘(ω) and G“(ω), respectively, at T =25 °C. Measurements were carried out using a rheometer TA AR2000 (TA instruments, New Castle Delaware, USA) equipped with stainless-steel parallel plate (d =40 mm). 3 Results and discussion The investigation began by performing homogeneous Suzuki cross coupling of iodobenzene and phenylboronic acid (Fig. 1), using Na2CO3 as a base (Table 1 ). As biphenyl can be also synthesized via homo-coupling of phenylboronic acid or halobenzene, (i.e. Ullmann coupling), reference reactions without the addition of RhCl3, and with or without the presence of Na2CO3, were first tested and did not yield any biphenyl. Moreover, it was previously reported that palladium contaminants in commercially available Na2CO3 were responsible for the generation of biaryls [63], yet ICP-OES analysis of Na2CO3 solution did not yield any trace of palladium. Performing the reaction in ethanol, using RhCl3 as the catalyst yielded biphenyl (Table 1, entry 1). As expected, addition of water to the reaction mixture in ethanol tremendously increased the activity (Table 1, entry 2), probably due to better dissolution of the catalyst, sodium carbonate and phenylboronic acid in the reaction mixture [37,60–62]. Yet, addition of aqueous solution of ἰ to the reaction mixture, resulted in lower conversion (Table 1, entry 3) than the reaction with water and without polysaccharide (Table 1, entry 2), in contrary to the addition of aqueous ἰ solution to the Suzuki reactions when PdCl2 and PdCl2(TPPTS)2 were used as catalysts [37,39]. Furthermore, addition of the polysaccharide Guar Gum (G), which has some solubility in ethanol, to the reaction mixture, without addition of water, also yielded lower conversion than the homogeneous reaction in ethanol (Table 1, entry 4), again in contrary to the reaction with palladium catalysts [37]. Thus, it seems that that rhodium could have the ability to coordinate or interact directly with polysaccharides even without the addition of TPPTS ligand. At last, as expected [37, 39], replacing iodobenzene by bromobenzene yielded lower conversion (Table 1, entry 6), and using less active arylhalides, i.e. chlorobenzene or 2-bromoaniline, yielded even lower conversion (Table 1, entry 7 and 8, respectively), yet proceeding the reaction after 24 h yielded increased conversions rates. A possible mechanistic pathway of the Suzuki cross-coupling with the new catalyst, i.e., PSRhCl3 can be divided into four steps: (a) oxidative addition of aromatic halides, R–X, to the catalyst yielding R-PSRhCl3-X, (b) removal of the halide by sodium carbonate to form R-PSRhCl3−CO3Na (c) transmetalation between the new rhodium species and phenylboronic acid (R'-B(OH)2) to form the intermediate R-PSRhCl3-R', and (d) reductive elimination, which releases the product, R-R', to regenerate the catalyst. At last, though the common oxidation state of rhodium is +3, like in RhCl3, it can also be in oxidation states from 0 to +6. Thus, it seems that during the oxidative addition step at the beginning of the catalytic cycle, the active species Rh(I) is oxidized to Rh(III), and then regenerated back to Rh(I) during the reductive elimination [64,65]. In the next stage the ability of ἰ to act as support for RhCl3 was tested. At first, mixing aqueous solution of RhCl3 with aqueous solution of ἰ followed by deep freezing and lyophilization yielded a 'sponge-like' catalyst, designated ἰ-RhCl3 (Fig. 2 A). After 24 h the ἰ-RhCl3 catalyst yielded a conversion of 37 % (Table 1, entry 5), lower than that of the homogeneous parent catalyst (Table 1, entry 1). Again, this is as opposed to the reactions with ἰ-PdCl2(TPPTS)2 and ἰ-Pd(OAc)2(TPPTS)2, which yielded higher conversion than the homogeneous reactions with PdCl2(TPPTS)2 and Pd(OAc)2(TPPTS)2 [37, 38]. Next, the ability of ἰ-RhCl3 to be recycled and its reproducibility was tested (Table 2 , entry 1, Fig. 2). The new heterogeneous systems could be easily separated from the reaction mixture and recycled three times, whereas proceeding the reaction with the filtrated reaction mixture after removal of the catalysts did not result in increase of the conversion, thus indicating that the catalyst was not leaching. Moreover, surprisingly the first and second recycling of the catalysts (Fig. 2B, 2C) yielded higher conversion than the former reaction cycle (entry 1). In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 2, the color of the catalyst became darker from cycle to cycle. It can be attributed to the formation of rhodium nanoparticles during the reaction, as was previously detected when ἰ-PdCl2(TPPTS)2 was used as a catalyst under similar reaction condition [37]. Yet, like in the ἰ-RhCl(TPPTS)3 system [39], analyzing i-RhCl3 catalyst using TEM after reaction did not show any nanoparticles (data not shown). Alternatively, the catalyst color might have been changed in accordance to different coordination state of the metal due to its interaction with the polysaccharide. The change in the coordination state of the metal can also explain the activation of the catalyst during the cycles. Another explanation can be that the xerogel swelling was changed during the cycles, allowing higher diffusion rates, resulting in higher conversion rates. To further investigate the effect of the polysaccharide on both the RhCl3 leaching and recycling, RhCl3 was heterogenized using the same procedure on different types of polysaccharides and employed in the Suzuki reaction (Table 2). From the results in Table 2, it is clear that the catalysts that were supported on the polysaccharides with sulfate groups, i.e., ἰ, κ and λ, were superior and could be recycled at least 2 times without leaching of the RhCl3 to the reaction mixture  (entries 1–3). Hence, it seems that the RhCl3 coordinates to the sulfate group, yielding a new complex. Indeed it was previously reported that rhodium can form complexes with different sulfur based molecules [66,67]. Furthermore, when an ester group was found in the polysaccharide backbone, like in the case of X (entry 4), the RhCl3 also did not leach, probably due to coordination of the metal center to the carboalkoxy group. Yet, the X-based catalyst was partly dissolved in the reaction mixture, thus could not be recycled for more than one time. The other polysaccharide-based RhCl3 catalysts were either partly dissolved in the reaction mixture and/or showed leaching of the RhCl3 (Table 2, entries 5–8). Moreover, when only hydroxyl groups were found on the polysaccharide the conversion was very low (Table 2, entry 8), while when only hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups were found, the activity rate was higher but part of the catalysts also leached (Table 2, entries 5–7). In order to verify that the ἰ-based RhCl3 catalyst did not leach out from the support, the reaction mixtures of the various cycles were run for an additional 24 h under similar reaction conditions after removal of the catalyst by filtration. In all the heterogeneous reactions the conversions of the reaction after removal of the catalyst and mixing for an additional 24 h were not changed. Furthermore, ICP-OES detection of the reaction mixtures after 24 h reaction and removal of the heterogonous catalysts did not show any rhodium leftovers, as rhodium content was below detection limit (< 1 ppm), revealing that the catalyst were indeed heterogeneous. As was proven from the leaching tests, that all the RhCl3 (0.002 g) was loaded on the ἰ support (0.065 g), the calculated weight catalyst loading percentage was 6.5 % of rhodium. Since the ἰ -based RhCl3 catalyst was the most efficient heterogeneous system, we chose to study the nature of the interaction between the RhCl3 and ἰ. At first FTIR analysis was employed (Fig. 3 ). As previously reported addition of metal complexes of palladium or rhodium with TPPTS as ligand to ἰ resulted in the formation of new sulfonic esters, by the interaction between the sulfonic acid on the ligand and the hydroxyls on the polymer, hence demonstrating a new characteristic band at 1030 cm−1 [37–39]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the FTIR spectra of native ἰ and ἰ-RhCl3 (Fig. 3A and B, respectively) were similar, containing all the expected peaks [68–71]. Although it might be that there is overlapping or low intensity band/s in the ἰ-RhCl3 spectrum, it also could indicate that no new bond was formed between the metal and the polysaccharide, thus implying that it might be that the active groups on the polysaccharide were coordinated to the metal. To further investigate the heterogeneous catalyst structure, SEM analysis was also performed. The SEM image of ἰ-RhCl3 was characterized by a macro-porous structure (Fig. 4 ) which differed from the laminar surface observed for the native ἰ, as illustrated previously in our former publication [37,39] (Fig. 4). This difference indicates that the RhCl3 supplement caused a change in the overall new structure and implies that the RhCl3 was interacting with the polysaccharide. It was previously reported that addition of various cations of different valence to the anionic sulfate groups in ἰ-carrageenan aqueous solution yields ionic forces and can produce sol-gel by the formation of a ‘double-helix’ structure [72–75]. In addition, the cations can also interact with the hydroxyl groups on the carrageenan structure, as previously proposed regarding different metal cations supported on carrageenans [76]. However, though, addition of PdCl2(TPPTS)2 to ἰ, i.e., ἰ-PdCl2(TPPTS)2, was characterized by porous and ordered surfaces, when compared with native ἰ [37], addition of RhCl3 to ἰ, i.e., ἰ-RhCl3, yielded a much more porous and ordered system, revealing that the interactions of the polymer with RhCl3 are different. Moreover, while PdCl2 leached out from the ἰ-PdCl2 system, RhCl3 showed no leaching from ἰ-RhCl3, implying that the rhodium is immobilized to the surface. Elemental analysis of the ἰ-RhCl3 catalyst was also performed, using SEM-EDS (Fig. 4). As expected, the analysis indicated that RhCl3 was embedded within the ἰ, with molar elemental ratio of Cl:Rh 3:1 as derived from the homogenous salt. A surface-sensitive technique, XPS, was also applied to analyze the surface composition of the ἰ-RhCl3 in comparison to the native ἰ. As seen in Table 3 , there was no significant difference between the atomic basic elemental ratios and the peak of their binding energies in both samples. In general, the C1 s XPS spectra for each sample could be decomposed into three main contributions at different binding energies (BE), which are associated with different types of elements that are linked to the carbon atoms: aliphatic carbons, CO and OCO, and R-SO3–. In addition, the S2p3 could be composed into two different elements, which are associated with the R-SO3– binding, depending on the R structure [77]. Indeed, all these assignments are in accordance to the polysaccharide structure. Therefore, the XPS analyses clearly demonstrated that no new covalent bonds were formed between the polysaccharide and the rhodium chloride during the xerogel preparation. As expected, the surface area of ἰ-RhCl3 contained rhodium, whereas no rhodium was present in the native ἰ (Table 3). This is evidence that the rhodium was successfully embedded into the polysaccharide matrix. Moreover, the Rh3d doublet (Fig. 5 A) represents a single rhodium state with a Rh3d5/2 binding energy of 309.92 eV, which is in good agreement with the values in the range of 309.7–310.3 eV that were reported in the literature for the typical binding energy of Rh+3 [78–82]. These findings demonstrate that the rhodium oxidation state was not changed and kept its original form, which was derived from RhCl3, i.e +3. In addition, the Cl2p spectrum consists of one doublet, corresponding to binding energy of 198.72 (Fig. 5B), indicating a terminal Cl species [80]. Finally, the observed atomic ratio of Rh:Cl in the heterogeneous catalyst was around 3:1, as in the homogenous salt, as illustrated in Table 3. In order to better understand the specific interaction between the RhCl3 and the ἰ, a physicochemical analysis was also employed. Viscosity measurements of both aqueous ἰ solutions, with and without RhCl3, were performed and are shown in Fig. 6 . In general, both preparations yielded typical non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior, indicating that the shear stress reduces the viscosity. However, the ἰ-RhCl3 system yielded higher viscosity in comparison to the native ἰ solution. This substantial increase in viscosity could be ascribed to screening of intermolecular electrostatic repulsions by RhCl3, leading to a greater degree of self-association [83]. The mechanical spectra of both aqueous solutions, i.e. the storage (or elastic) modulus (G’) and viscous (or loss) modulus (G”), were also measured as function of frequency (Fig. 7 ). It was found that in both preparations, at low frequencies, the mechanical spectrum is similar to that of dilute solutions (G”>G'), because there is sufficient time for the chains’ relaxation. However, at high frequencies, there is no sufficient time for recovery, and the solution responds as if it were a solid (G'>G”). In addition, both prearations exhibited a crossover region, while subjected to increasing frequencies, in which the storage modulus crossed the loss (Fig. 7). Up to 10.58 Hz the neat ἰ aquaous solution showed higher G” than G', indicating that the solution is more viscous than elastic (Fig. 7A). However, in the range above 2.3 Hz ἰ solution with RhCl3 yielded G’ values that exceeded those of the G” (Fig. 7B). Moreover, the G’ values of the solution with RhCl3 were higher than those that were measured with the neat ἰ solution. Hence, the ἰ aqueous solution with RhCl3 yielded an elastic gel-like structured system with more stable structure, probably by promoting the increased association of the chain polysaccharide molecules. However, the moduli is still frequency dependent, and G' values are less than 10 times larger than G”, indicating that the desired developed gels were yet to be achieved. Indeed, specific metal ions of different valency can form non- and specific interactions with carrageenan solutions. These interactions can cause aggregation of different carrageenan forms, leading to more viscous systems, with stabilized gel structures [[83–88]. For example, an addition of divalent Ca2+ ion to ἰ solution has a pronounced helix-stabilizing effect in inducing gel formation [87,89]. The Ca-sensitivity of ἰ is attributed to the joint effect of Ca2+ ions and water molecules in mediating a strong interaction between the sulfate groups of neighboring helices [87]. 4 Conclusions To conclude, RhCl3 was sucessfuly immobilized to ἰ in a very simple and straightforward method, and was sucessfuly employed in a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. In addition, the salt did not leach out to the reaction mixture and the catalyst was successfully recycled with an increase in activity in first and the second recycles. Furthermore, the characterization of the lyophilized ἰ-RhCl3 system showed that although there is probably no new bond between the salt and the polymer, as demonstrated by FTIR, the salt is embedded whithin the support. Furthermore, SEM images show that addition of RhCl3 to ἰ yielded a more porous and ordered structure in comparison to native ἰ, implying on an interaction between the two. Additionally, XPS analysis showed a typical binding energy of Rh+3 where the atomic ratio of Rh:Cl in the heterogeneous catalyst was around 3:1. Finally, viscosity measurements also revealed that RhCl3 interacts with the polysachride, as addition of RhCl3 to aquaous ἰ solution reslted in increase of viscosity. Thus, it was suggested that the rhodium salt was not entraped within the polysacharide matrix but immobilized by ἰ-carrgennan coordination to RhCl3 via the sulfate groups in their backbone.

        "dc:description": "RhCl3 was heterogenized into renewable polysaccharide supports, and the effect of polysaccharide type on the new catalyst performances in a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction was studied. The conversion of the fresh iota carrageenan heterogeneous system (ἰ-RhCl3), was found to be the highest, whereas it was lower than the conversion of its homogeneous analogue. In addition, the ἰ-RhCl3 (catalyst loading of 6.5 % wt) was proven to be efficient heterogeneous catalyst that was easily recycled, whereas the conversion was increased in the first and second cycles. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) combining Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed, confirming that RhCl3 was embedded within the ἰ-carrageenan. The Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry of the heterogeneous ἰ-RhCl3 catalyst was compared to that of the native polysaccharide, and no new bands were detected. Nonetheless, a comparison of SEM image of ἰ-carrageenan with and without RhCl3, as well as rheological measurements of the aqueous solution of ἰ with and without RhCl3, indicated the incorporation of the polysaccharide with the RhCl3.",
