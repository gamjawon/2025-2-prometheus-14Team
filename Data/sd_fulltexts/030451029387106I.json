Kelkar, R.S. Ubale and R.V. Chaudhari* Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411 008 (India) (Received July 7, 1992; accepted November 16, 1992 ) Abstract Carbonylation of methyl acetate to acetic anhydride using nickel complex catalysts with iodide promoter and an organic N- or P-containing base as a ligand is reported. The effect of different types of ligands and reaction conditions on activity of the catalyst was investigated. The highest catalytic activity was observed with isoquinoline as a ligand. The activity of the catalyst was found to be enhanced significantly in the presence of hydrogen, while retaining its high selectivity to acetic anhydride. The activity decreased with increase in acetic anhydride concentration. The selectivity of acetic anhydride was found to be greater than 95-96% in the range of conditions studied. Key words: acetic anhydride; homogeneous catalysts; methyl acetate, nickel complexes Introduction Carbonylation of methyl acetate provides an alternative route for the manufacture of acetic anhydride, and this process is one of the most successful examples of the commercialisation of a coal-based chemical process [ 1 ] . Although reported in the 1950s, this reaction was studied in greater detail, only after the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. A variety of catalysts consisting of Rh, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd and Os complexes have been reported [ 2-5 ] . Of all the catalysts, Rh-catalyzed carbonylation has been studied in greater detail [ 2,68]. Nickel complex catalysts are generally considered to have a poor activity for the carbonylation of methyl acetate [2], but recent patents [3,9] indicate that the activity of Ni catalyst can be substantially enhanced in the presence of suitable ligands. A systematic study of the role of different types of ligands on the activity of Ni complex catalysts has not been reported so far. The aim of this work was to study the effect of N- and P-containing ligands and reaction conditions on the activity of Ni complex catalysts. *Corresponding author.

Catal. 80 (1993) 21-29 Experimental Materials The catalyst precursor, NiC12-6H20, solvent, acetic acid, methyl acetate, methyl iodide and the product, acetic anhydride, of AR quality, were procured from BDH Laboratories, Bombay, while N- or P-containing ligands of AR quality were produced from Fluka AG, Switzerland. Carbon monoxide gas ( > 99.5% pure) was used directly from the cylinders. This gas was generated and compressed in our own laboratory. Hydrogen gas was used from the cylinders supplied by Indian Oxygen Ltd. Preparation of Ni(isq)2C12* The complex, Ni (isq) 4C12, was prepared by a published procedure [ 10 ] . The complex was dried under vacuum for one hour and stored in the dessicator under an inert atmosphere. Elemental analysis of the complex was found to be within 2% of the theoretical values. The carbonylation experiments were carried out in a 300 ml autoclave (made of Hastelloy-C-276, supplied by Parr Instrument Co., USA). This autoclave, was suitably equipped for sampling of liquid and gas phase, automatic temperature control and variable stirrer speed. Procedure In a typical experiment, the reactor was charged with known quantities of catalyst, promoter, ligand, methyl acetate and solvent, and the contents were flushed with nitrogen. The contents were then flushed with CO and heated to a desired temperature. Hydrogen (if used) was introduced to a desired value and the reactor was filled with CO up to the required pressure. A liquid sample was withdrawn and the reaction was initiated by stirring. The reaction was then continued at a required constant pressure by a supply of CO from the reservoir vessel. In most cases for screening of catalyst systems, the reactions were carried out until absorption stopped completely, indicating complete conversion of the reactant. At the end of the reaction, the liquid as well as the gas samples were analyzed for reactants and products by gas chromatography. In every experiment, the gas phase was examined by Orsat [ 11 ] analysis, to check for CO balance as well as formation of C02 by water-gas shift reaction. The analysis of the carbonylation products was carried out using an HP 5840 gas chromatograph using 1/8\", 8 ft. long stainless steel column packed with OV-17 on Chromosorb W-AW, 80-100 mesh and FID detector. Methane was analyzed using a Porapak Q column and TCD detector. *isq=isoquinoline. A.A. Kelkar et al./J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 21-29 23 Results and discussion In the carbonylation of methyl acetate using nickel complex catalyst, it was observed that acetic anhydride was the only major product in all the cases. However, in the presence of moisture, some of the acetic anhydride was converted to acetic acid. In most cases, methane in traces was detected. In each experiment, the conversion of methyl acetate, CO consumed, selectivity to acetic anhydride, and methane formation were observed. It was found that the material balance of methyl acetate and CO consumed agreed with acetic anhydride produced to the extent of 95% for all the catalytic systems studied. Screening of ligands The results on the average activity and selectivity with NiC12-61120 as a catalyst precursor are presented in Table 1. NiCl2-61120 alone showed no activity for carbonylation of methyl acetate. However, in the presence of ligands such as triphenyl phosphine and isoquinoline, a highly active catalyst was obtained. In the presence of hydrogen, the activity of these catalysts further increased. The effects of other ligands, such as tributyl phosphine, tributyl phosphite, 3-picoline, pyridine, etc., were also studied. For tributyl phosphite and triphenyl phosphite, no activity was observed.

Kelkar et al. 1J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 21-29 This can be explained on the basis of formation of inactive complexes like NiL4 (L=triphenyl phosphite or tributyl phosphite). However, for all the other ligands, no significant effect of the type of ligand used was observed. In all the experiments the selectivity to acetic anhydride was found to be in the range 66-76% and in these cases a significant amount of acetic acid was produced as a co-product. This was found to be mainly due to the conversion of acetic anhydride to acetic acid by reaction with water molecules from the catalyst precursor NiCl2-6H20. It was also observed that the acetic acid produced was equivalent to water released from the catalyst precursor NiC12-6H20, In the experiments carried out with (Ni(isq)4C12and Ni(PPh3)ZC12 as catalyst precursors the average activity as well as selectivity to acetic anhydride were very high (ca. 95.8% ), which supports the above conclusions. Therefore, further work was carried out using Ni(isq)4C12 as a catalyst precursor. Effects of various factors The effects of changes in various factors on the reaction were examined. Isoquinoline concentration The effect of the isoquinoline concentration on the average activity and selectivity at 498 K was studied and the results are presented in Table 2. The average activity of the catalyst increased with increase in isoquinoline concentration, while the selectivity to acetic anhydride (ca. 96%) was not affected. Small amounts of methane were formed in all the cases (selectivity ca. 3.54.0% ). Catalyst concentration The effect of catalyst (Ni(isq)4C12) concentration on the activity and selectivity was studied at 498 K and the results are presented in Table 3. In these experiments the ligand to catalyst ratio of 4 was kept constant.

Methyl acetate concentration The effect of methyl acetate concentration on the activity and selectivity at 498 K was also studied. The results are presented in Table 4. The average activity as well as the selectivity decreased slightly with increase in methyl acetate concentration. At a methyl acetate concentration of 0.625 X 10-3 mol/ cm', the conversion of methyl acetate as well as the selectivity to acetic anhydride were very high, whereas at higher concentrations (e.g. 2.5 X 10-3 ), the reaction did not proceed after 77% conversion, thus reducing the average activity. The selectivity to acetic anhydride was marginally lower in this case due to increased formation of methane. The possible reason for retardation in the activity at higher concentrations could be due to inhibition of the rate by the product acetic anhydride. In order to confirm this, some experiments were TABLE 4 Effect of methyl acetate concentration on the activity and selectivity of nickel catalysts' No. Methyl Total Average activity X 10` Conversion Selectivity acetate time (mol/g cat./h) of methyl concentration (min) acetate AC20 Methane X10-3,mol (%) (%) (%) 1 0.625 80 4.455 96.50 98.50 1.10 2 1.25 150 4.432 92.53 95.80 3.59 3 2.50 303 3.609 77.30 94.32 5.15 Reaction conditions: Ni (isq )4C12: 4.2 X 10-3 mol; ligand: 1.68 X 10-2 mol; methyl iodide: 6.40 X 10-2 mol; partial pressure of C0: 40.81 atm; partial pressure of 112' 9.52 atm; temperature: 498 K; agitation speed: 700 rpm; total volume: 100 ml. 26 A.A. Kelkar et al./J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 21-29 carried out to study the effect of acetic anhydride concentration on average activity of the catalyst. The results of these experiments are described below. Acetic anhydride concentration The effect of acetic anhydride concentration on the average activity and selectivity at 498 K was studied. The results are presented in Table 5. The average activity of the catalyst diminished strongly with increase in the initial acetic anhydride concentration; selectivity was not affected. This explains the drop in average activity as well as the low conversions with increase in methyl acetate concentration in a given batch experiment. Methyl iodide concentration The effect of methyl iodide concentration, at 498 K, was studied and the results are presented in Table 6.

This indicates that, the intermediate hydride complexes of nickel could be more active for carbonylation reactions. However, the mechanism of Ni catalysed carbonylation as well as the hydrogen effect is not yet well understood and will require further investigation. Temperature The effect of temperature on the average activity and selectivity in the temperature range 478-508 K was studied. The results are presented in Table 9. The average activity of the catalyst increased with increase in temperature, while the selectivity to acetic anhydride was not affected. Conclusions The carbonylation of methyl acetate was studied using Ni complex catalyst with emphasis on the roles of N- and P-containing ligands and reaction conditions. The average activity of Ni complex catalyst was found to be increased significantly in the presence of isoquinoline and triphenylphosphine type ligands. The activity was also enhanced in the presence of hydrogen but inhibition in the rate was observed due to the product, acetic anhydride. The selectivity of acetic anhydride was found to be greater than 95-96 % in all cases. References 1 H.W. Coover and R.C. Hart, Chem. Eng. Progr., (1982) 72. 2 G. Luft and M. Schrod, J. Mot.

The effect of different types of ligands and reaction conditions on activity of the catalyst was investigated. The highest catalytic activity was observed with isoquinoline as a ligand. The activity of the catalyst was found to be enhanced significantly in the presence of hydrogen, while retaining its high selectivity to acetic anhydride. The activity decreased with increase in acetic anhydride concentration. The selectivity of acetic anhydride was found to be greater than 95–96% in the range of conditions studied.",
