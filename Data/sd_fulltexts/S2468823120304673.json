Graphical abstract Manganese oxide catalysts with self-modulating K+ content and tunable concentration of lattice oxygen and Mn4+ were synthesized and investigated for HCHO oxidation. The preparation method affects the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of the catalysts. Herein, the role of K+ in enhancing the lattice oxygen mobility of manganese oxide catalysts for enhanced formaldehyde (HCHO) is presented. The presence of K+ enhances the redox properties of Mn and promotes catalytic activity by enhancing the mobility of the lattice oxygen and sustaining the availability of surface active oxygen to sustain the reaction. Catalytic activity was observed to improve with increasing K+ content and the surface concentration of lattice oxygen and Mn4+. A drastic reduction in catalytic activity was observed in the acid-treated samples, with low K+ concentration. Characterization results indicate that the presence of K+ enhances activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen by the weakening the Mn-O bond in manganese oxide and promotes the redox properties of the catalyst. The absence of K+ impacted the mobility of the lattice oxygen and the ability of the catalyst to supplement the consumed oxygen species, resulting into reduced catalytic activity and deactivation in the room-temperature (30 °C) activity and stability test. Keywords formaldehyde manganese oxide catalyst potassium catalytic oxidation lattice oxygen Introduction The removal of formaldehyde (HCHO) – a known and confirmed carcinogenic substance, from the indoor environment is pertinent to improving indoor air quality and comfort. Satisfactory pieces of evidence have revealed that exposure to HCHO over a long period, can lead to nasopharyngeal cancer, sinonasal cancer, and leukaemia [1]. Some of its major indoor sources include wooden works, furniture and construction materials; others may include indoor combustion processes, such as cooking, smoking, and heating [2,3]. Amongst the HCHO removal techniques, catalytic oxidation seems more promising, as the complete conversion of HCHO into CO2 and H2O can be achieved [4]. Catalysts containing noble metals are promising in this respect, and various techniques devised have enhanced their low to room temperature activity for HCHO oxidation. Alkali metals doping, mainly Na+ and K+, has been demonstrated to be a very effective strategy [5–8]. Bai et al.[5] observed a promotional effect of K+ addition on the activity of Ag/Co3O4 catalyst for HCHO by promoting the generation of surface OH-. Zhang et al.[8] observed a phenomenal improvement in the catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2, after its treatment with Na. Total oxidation of HCHO was achieved at room temperature over the Na modified Pt/TiO2, in contrast to 150 °C for the untreated catalyst. In another study, Na+ was observed to promote the stabilization and dispersion of Pd on TiO2 support, and enhanced its activity by facilitating the activation of chemisorbed oxygen and OH groups to achieve room temperature oxidation of HCHO (compare to 120 °C for unmodified Pd/TiO2) [7]. Similar promotional effects of Na+ were observed by Nie at al.[6] for HCHO oxidation on Pt supported TiO2 catalysts. However, there is a growing interest and focus on transition metals for catalysis due to their relative abundance and cost-effectiveness [9,10]. Manganese oxide based catalysts are amongst the most promising transition metal alternatives for low-temperature HCHO oxidation [4]. The effectiveness of metal oxides for catalytic oxidation and other applications is affected by their propensity to cycle between two valence states and the mobility of their lattice oxygen [11]. The efficiency of VOCs oxidation over MnOx catalysts is strongly influenced by the redox properties of Mn, and the reactivity and mobility of the lattice oxygen [12], with Mn higher oxidation state (Mn4+) shown to be more active for the oxidation of o-xylene [13], toluene [14], HCHO [10,15], CO [16], and methane [17]. Enhancing the redox cycle of Mn (Mn4+↔ Mn3+) by facilitating the activation of molecular oxygen and enhancing the mobility of lattice oxygen was shown to be an effective strategy for improving catalytic oxidation of HCHO [10,18]. Most of the investigated manganese oxide based catalysts, such as layered birnessite-type MnO2 and octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2), contain K+. It has been reported that K+ facilitates the dissociation of molecular oxygen and desorption of water molecules, through an electron transfer mechanism from potassium to oxygen [19], and also enhances the generation surface active oxygen species such through the creation of oxygen and/or manganese vacancies [20–22]. It was previously demonstrated that K+ facilitates the migration of the lattice oxygen of 3D CO3O4 for enhanced catalytic oxidation of HCHO over Ag/CO3O4 [5], it is therefore interesting to understand the effect of K+ on the mobility and activity of the lattice oxygen of manganese oxide for HCHO oxidation, since K+ is structurally present in most of the manganese oxide based catalyst. To investigate the role of K+ in the catalytic oxidation of HCHO over manganese oxide catalysts, a two way strategy was deployed by synthesizing manganese oxide catalysts with self-modulating and varying K+ concentration and subjecting the synthesized catalysts to acid-treatment to remove the K+ from the catalyst’s framework. By varying the molar ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(NO3)2 in the reaction mixture, not only is the K+ concentration modulated but also the morphology, lattice oxygen and Mn4+ content. Increasing the KMnO4 content in the reaction mixture led to an increase in the K+ content, lattice oxygen and surface concertation of Mn4+. On the other hand, the acid-treatment of the pristine catalysts led to a drastic reduction in the K+ content of the catalysts and the creation of oxygen vacancies. Characterization and activity evaluation results (in the presence and absence of molecular oxygen) showed that the presence of K+ enhances the activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen by weakening the interaction between Mn and O, and also facilitates the replenishment of consumed oxygen, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and stability for HCHO oxidation. The surface reaction mechanisms of both the pristine and acid-treated catalysts were investigated via in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements. Experimental Catalyst synthesis In a given preparation of MnOx based catalysts, calculated amounts of KMnO4 (Sinopharm) and Mn(NO3)2 (Sigma Aldrich) equivalent to 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 molar ratio were dissolved in 100 ml deionized water in a beaker. KMnO4 solution was gradually added to the Mn(NO3)2 at 50 °C while the pH was gradually adjusted using 2 M KOH until a pH of 10 was under continuous stirring. The obtained brown precipitates were aged in the supernatant solution at the same temperature for 2 hrs. The precipitates were then filtered, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol until neutral. The samples were then dried in an oven at 105 °C for 12 hrs. The dried samples were further calcined at 300 °C in air for 3 hrs. The obtained samples were denoted Mx, where x is the molar ratio of KMnO4 to Mn(NO3)2 in the precursor solution. For comparison, M0 was synthesized using the same method and conditions in the absence of KMnO4. Subsequently, the obtained samples (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8) were treated in 100 ml 0.1 M HNO3 solution for 6 hrs under continuous stirring. The acid-treated samples were then rinsed severally with deionized water until neutral and then dried at 105 °C and denoted A0.1 Mx. For comparison, some acid-treated samples were subjected to further calcination at 300 °C for 3 hrs and denoted as A0.1 MxH. Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns of the synthesized catalysts were analysed on D8 Advanced (Bruker, Germany) instrument operating at 40 mA, 40 mV. Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected on Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope equipped with an excitation source operating at 532 nm. The spectra were collected between 60 and 1500 cm-1. Hitachi S-4800 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) was used to observe the morphological structures of the catalysts while elemental composition and mapping was conducted using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Prior to the FESEM analysis, the samples were sputtered with platinum on Hitachi E-1045. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired on JEM-2100 200Kv electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan). Micrometrics ASAP 2020 analyzer (Surface Area and Porosity Analyser) was used to evaluate the textural properties of the catalysts. The BET surface area of the catalysts was calculated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms using the multipoint method, while the pore size distribution was calculated from the BHJ desorption isotherm. Prior to the analysis, the samples were outgassed at 200 °C for 3 hrs. The chemical states, binding energy and surface elemental composition of the catalysts were analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. XPS measurements were conducted on Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, with Al Kα x-ray source with characteristic excitation energy of 1,486.7 eV. The binding energies of all elements were calibrated based on the adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (NexION 300, PerkinElmer) was used to determine the elemental composition of the catalysts. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on Micrometrics Autochem II (chemisorption analyzer). About 50 mg samples were weighed into a quartz tube and outgassed at 150 °C, under a 50 ml min-1 flow of Ar for 1 hr, prior to the analysis. The pre-treated samples were cooled down to about 30 °C. The gas flow was then switched to 8% H2/Ar mixture (50 ml min-1). The temperature was slowly ramped at a rate of 5 °C min-1 to 600 °C, and the H2 consumption was monitored by a calibrated TCD detector. The surface reaction and intermediate species of HCHO oxidation were examined via in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis on Thermo fisher, Nicolet 6700 fitted with a reaction cell (Harrick, Praying Mantis). Purified air was used to inject HCHO (∼ 75 ppm) into the cell at a flow of 30 ml min-1, and the spectra recorded (resolution 4 cm-1 and accumulation of 32 scans). Prior to the DRIFTS analysis, samples were treated at 200 °C in a 20 ml min-1 flow of Ar for 30 minutes. Catalytic activity test The catalytic activities of the catalysts were investigated under the same conditions in a dynamic mode. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of 40-60 mesh catalysts were loaded in a fixed bed quartz reactor with an internal diameter of 6 mm. About 170 ppm of HCHO gas was generated by passing air over paraformaldehyde (97% Alfa Aesar) maintained at 30 °C, in a U-shaped quartz tube. The relative humidity of the inlet stream was maintained at 45%, by bubbling air over deionized water. The concentration of HCHO and relative humidity of the feed stream was maintained by adjusting the flowrate of the make-up gas. The total flowrate of the inlet stream was maintained at 100 ml min-1 with the aid of mass flow controllers, which corresponds to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 ml·g-1 h-1. The concentration of CO2 and HCHO from the reactor were monitored online using GC (Agilent 7890B) fitted with an Agilent CP-Sil 5 CB column (0.32 × 50 m), Polyarc reactor (Activated Research Company (ARC), US) and an FID detector. Both HCHO and CO2 are first converted into CH4 with the aid of the Polyarc reactor before being detected by the FID. Polyarc reactor, which is a universal carbon detector with the capacity to convert hydrocarbons into methane through a 2 step post-column oxidation-methanation process (HCs → CO2 → CH4) [23]. CO2 was the only detected product of the oxidation reaction. Prior to the reaction, the reactor was calibrated by standard gases of HCHO and CO2. The room temperature activity and stability of the catalysts (M0.5, A0.1 M0.5 and M0) were evaluated in a continuous flow mode for 72 hrs at a GHSV of 60,000 ml·g-1 h-1 at 30 °C, and HCHO concentration of ∼10 ppm. Since CO2 was the only detected product, the conversion of HCHO (%) over the catalysts was calculated as thus: (1) Conversion % = C O 2 HCHO × 100 where CO2 and HCHO stand for the concentration (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the outlet stream and that of HCHO in the inlet stream, respectively. The conversion efficiency was monitored between the temperature ranges of 30 – 120 °C. The specific rate was calculated as follows [22]: (2) Specific rate μmol m -2 min -1 = HCHO × f × η 22.4 × S BET × m × 10 -5 where [HCHO] represents the inlet concentration of HCHO (ppm), f is the total flowrate (ml. min-1), m is the mass of catalyst (g), η is the conversion (%) and SBET stands for the measured BET surface area of the catalysts. Lattice oxygen test was conducted on M0.5 and A0.1 M0.5 samples according to the modified procedure reported elsewhere [15]. Prior to the test, the catalysts were treated in a flow of pure air (50 ml min-1) for 30 min. at 150 °C, the treated catalysts were then purged with pure N2 (50 ml min-1) for 30 min. at the same temperature, to remove molecular oxygen and weakly adsorbed species. A flow of N2 (99.99%) containing ∼ 170 ppm of HCHO (GHSV 60,000 ml·g-1 h-1) was passed over the catalysts at 60 °C and the reaction was monitored online for 600 min.. The conversion of HCHO was computed according to Eq. 1, while the evolution of CO2 and HCHO were monitored using GC-Polyarc reactor. Results and Discussion Phase structure and morphology The XRD patterns of the investigated catalysts are depicted in Fig. 1 . The weak peaks of the catalysts showed that they are poorly crystalline to amorphous in nature. The peaks at 17.9, 28.6, 31.2, 36.4, 37.9, 64.6, and 67.4° are indexed to tetragonal hausmanite structured Mn3O4 (PDF #24-0734), while the peaks at 36.7, 39.0, 47.5, and 66.2° are assigned to MnO2 [13]. The weak and broad peaks at 36.7, 42.5, and 65.8° are indexed to hexagonal birnessite type MnO2 (JCPDS #18-0802) [21]. M0 is predominantly Mn3O4. Weak features of Mn3O4, in addition to those of birnessite MnO2, are observed in M0.2. Only the weak peaks attributable to layered birnessite MnO2 are present in M0.3 and M0.5. In the presence of permanganate ions, Mn2+ is favourably oxidized to Mn3+ and Mn4+ leading to the formation of birnessite MnO2 [24]. The observed peak broadening in the acid-treated samples could be attributed to partial crystal and layer distortion as a result of K+ extraction [25,26]. Due to the amorphous nature of the catalysts, Raman spectroscopy was conducted to further understand their crystal structures and the effects of K+. The Raman spectra of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . As seen in Fig. 2a, the peaks at 650, 480, 393, 304 and 266 cm-1 are attributed to Mn3O4 [27,28]. The Raman peaks located at 500-510 cm-1 (ν1), 569-582 cm1 (ν2) and 626-634 cm-1 (ν3) are characteristics of layered birnessite MnO2 [29]. They are respectively assigned to Mn-O-Mn stretching (ν1), Mn-O stretching (ν2) of the basal plane of MnO6 and the symmetric stretching of MnO6 (ν3) [21,29]. A significant weakening in the Mn3O4 features (650 cm-1) was observed while the peaks corresponding to birnessite MnO2 (582 and 626 cm-1) became more prominent in M0.2, in agreement with the XRD results. Birnessite MnO2 is mainly composed of layers of edge-sharing [MnO6] octahedra with K+ and water molecules at the interlayer spaces to compensate for the electric charge of the layers [30,31]. Only the three peaks characteristics of birnessite-type layered MnO2 were observed in M0.3 and M0.5 (Fig. 2a) and in M0.6 and M0.8 (Fig. S1), in agreement with the XRD results. The relative increase in the intensity of ratio of ν2 to ν3 (Fig. 2a) could be ascribed to the increase in K+ content in the interlayer structure of the birnessite MnO2 [32], in agreement with the elemental analysis (Table 1 ). On the other hand, a weakening in the intensity ratio of ν2 to ν3 was observed after the acid treatment (Fig. 2b). This is due to the polarizability variations between the two vibrational modes attributable to the removal of K+ ions from the interlayer structure of birnessite [25,26,32]. Morphological evolution due to variation in the KMnO4 concentration in the reaction mixture were observed, as shown in Fig. 3 . In the absence of KMnO4, M0 is composed of somewhat circular nanostructures with diameter ranging from 83 to149 nm and thickness from 25 to 40 nm. After the introduction of KMnO4 (M0.2), the morphology completely transformed into an open flower-like structure composed of long interweaved and packed nanorods, with an average thickness of 29 nm, which further compacted into loose and irregular spheres, composed of nanosheets with an average size of 25 nm (M0.3). Interestingly, at a molar ratio of 0.5 (M0.5), there was a complete morphological transformation into dense and aggregated nanospheres, which did not change after the acid treatment (A0.1 M0.5). No further changes in morphology was observed when the molar ratio was increased to 0.6 (M0.6) and 0.8 (M0.8), as shown in Fig. S2. However, a slight reduction in the size of the nanospheres was observed after the acid treatment, as shown in the TEM images (Fig. 4 a and c). This could be attributed to the abstraction of K+ from the interlayers of the birnessite [26], and the possible distortion of the layered structure during the acid treatment. The HRTEM images of M0.5 (Fig. 4b) and A0.1 M0.5 (Fig. 4d) showed both the pristine and acid-treated catalysts have exposed (001) and (100) lattice planes, which correspond to ∼ 0.7 and 0.24 nm interplanar spacing of birnessite MnO2, respectively. Physicochemical properties The BET surface area, pore volume, and pore diameters of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of all the catalysts correspond to Type IV adsorption isotherm (Fig. S3a), which is typical of mesoporous materials. This is further confirmed by the pore size distribution (see Fig. S3b), while the average pore size of all the catalysts (both pristine and acid-treated) falls within the range of 7-21 nm. As seen from Table 1, the surface area initially increases with the addition of KMnO4, but subsequently reduces as the amount of KMnO4 increases. The observed surface area trend conforms to the morphological transformation and particle size of the catalysts. As the particle size decreases, an increase in surface area was observed until the formation of compact and dense nanospheres. It is understood that the aggregation of the particles into compacted nanospheres led to a loss in surface area. However, an increase in surface area was observed in all the acid treated catalysts. This might be related to decrease in particle size, K+ leaching and the disruption of the layered structure during acid treatment [25,26], as observed in the Raman and TEM results. The elemental composition of the catalysts is presented in Table 1. As shown by the ICP-MS results, the concentration of K increases with increasing amount of KMnO4 in the precursor solutions. Increasing the molar ratio beyond 0.5 (0.6 and 0.8), does not result in any increase in the K+ content of M0.6 and M0.8, as shown in Table S1, likely due to the presence of excess amount of KMnO4 in the reaction mixtures (Fig. S4 and Supplementary Note 1). As such the optimum K+ was achieved in M0.5. The acid treatment succeeded in drastically reducing the content of K+ in the treated samples (A0.1 Mx), in agreement with the Raman results. As for the elemental mapping of M0.5 and A0.1 M0.5 (see Fig. S5 and S6), both Mn and O are well dispersed on both samples, while the intensity and dispersion of K significantly reduced after the acid treatment, further confirming the leaching of K+ from the acid-treated samples. The trend in the K+ content of the catalysts is consistent with the EDS and XPS results as presented in Table 1 and Fig. S7 (XPS K 2p spectrum). The XPS spectra of Mn 2p, O 1s and Mn 3s of the analyzed catalysts are presented in Fig. 5 a, 5b, and 5c, respectively. The Mn 2p and 3 s high resolution spectra may provide insights about the chemical environment of Mn. The deconvolution of the Mn 2p3/2 peak indicated the presence of two overlapped peaks with binding energies within the range of 642 – 642.3 eV and 642.9 – 643.6 eV corresponding to Mn4+and Mn3+ respectively [33]. No peaks related to Mn2+ were observed. The surface content of Mn3+ and Mn4+ were estimated based on their respective peak areas in the deconvoluted Mn 2p3/2 peak and presented in Table 2 . Higher content of Mn4+ may suggest higher oxidation, which increases with increasing K+ concentration. The Mn 3 s doublet splitting (ΔE, Fig. 5c) can be used to calculate the average oxidation state (AOS) of the catalysts based on the equation AOS = 8.956 – (1.126*ΔE) [34]. The AOS values of the catalysts are presented in Table 2 and ranges from 3.4 to 3.83, suggesting the presence of mixed states (Mn4+ and Mn3+), as observed in the Mn 2p3/2 deconvolution results (Table 2 and Fig. 5a). The increase in the Mn4+ and AOS with K+ concentration, indicates that the synthesis route and K+ concentration may have an has impact on the oxidation of Mn in the catalyst. It was suggested that higher ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ facilitates the redox cycle of Mn and enhances catalytic oxidation of HCHO and other VOCs [10,14,17], by enhancing the cyclic redox reaction of Mn (Mn4+ ↔ Mn3+) during the catalytic oxidation process [13,35]. Interestingly, a significant reduction in both the AOS and Mn4+ content of the acid-treated M0.5 (A0.1 M0.5) was observed, as shown in Table 2, in agreement with previous reports [20,26]. The presence of Mn3+ is associated with the creation of oxygen vacancies in MnO2 to maintain electrostatic balance due to Mn4+ vacancies [36]. The surface concentration of Mn3+ can be used as a relative measure for determining oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the acid treatment does not only facilitate the removal of K+ but also lead to the creation of vacancies, as reported elsewhere [26]. The peaks at 529.6–530 eV, 531.2–531.6 eV and 533.4-533.8 eV were respectively allocated to lattice oxygen (Olat), surface adsorbed oxygen species (Osuf) and surface adsorbed water (Owat) [13,35]. The relative amounts of the different surfaces oxygen species of the catalysts were determined from their respective areas and presented in Table 2. The catalysts possess surface defective sites and unsaturated oxygen belonging to defective oxides and hydroxyl groups (OH-, O-, O2-) [22,35]. The amount of lattice oxygen Olat increases monotonously with increasing K+ and Mn4+ content (Table 2), in accordance with the observations of Li et al.[14]. This shows that the K+ content, the oxidation state of manganese, and the lattice oxygen content of the catalysts can be systematically controlled by tuning the concentration of KMnO4 in the precursor solution. The increase in the electron density around Olat due to presence of K+ leads to a slight decrease in the binding energy of Olat [19,37], in agreement with the observed weakening of the Mn-O bonds with increasing K+ content in the Raman results (see next two paragraphs). The surface concentration of Osuf significantly increased after the acid treatment from 25% in M0.5 to 33% in A0.1 M0.5, indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies, in agreement with the observed decrease in the Mn4+ content after the acid treatment. A similar observation was reported elsewhere for acid-treated birnessite MnO2 [26,38]. However, the binding energy of the Olat in A0.1 M0.5 increased significantly after the acid treatment (530.0 eV) compared to the pristine M0.5 (529.6 eV). This indicates a reduction in the electron density around the lattice oxygen due to the creation of manganese vacancies as a result of K+ removal [19], in agreement with the observed decrease in the content of Mn4+ in A0.1 M0.5. A similar shift to the higher binding energy of the lattice oxide of birnessite MnO2 after the abstraction of K+ was observed elsewhere [19,38]. As such, more energy will be needed to mobilize the lattice oxygen of the acid-treated catalysts, compared to its pristine counterpart. It is therefore expected that K+ plays a vital role in enhancing the mobility of lattice oxygen. K+ is also reported to decrease the activation energy for desorption and activation of water and oxygen molecules to replenish the consumed oxygen species during HCHO oxidation [19]. The Raman results (Fig. 2) were used to obtain more information on the local structure of the catalysts. The increase in the intensity of the (ν2) peak (Fig. 2a), which is mainly due to Mn4+ in MnO6 basal plane [29], with increasing K+ content is related to the increase in the concentration of Mn4+, in agreement with the XPS results. The red shift of the peak from 582.6 cm-1 in M0.2, to 575.5 and 569 cm-1 in M0.3 and M0.5 respectively, could be attributed to the resulting weakening of the Mn-O bond strength of MnO2, due to its interaction with K+. The Raman red shift of the Mn-O stretching is due to the strong interaction between K+ and O, which results in the weakening of the bond strength, and enhances the mobility of the lattice oxygen [21]. Interestingly, no further red shift was observed in M0.6 and M0.8 (Fig. S1), perhaps because they contain similar amount of K+ as M0.5. As such, it is expected that the presence of K+ enhances the activity of the lattice oxygen due to the weakened interaction between Mn and O, in agreement with the XPS results. On the other hand, the observed peaks broadening and weakening of the peak intensity of (ν2) in the acid treated catalyst (Fig. 2b) is related to the decrease in the oxidation state of Mn/amount of Mn4+ and local disorder due to vacancies in the MnO6 sheets [21,29], in agreement with the XPS results. Therefore the acid treatment led to the removal of K+, creation of oxygen vacancies, and reduction in the Mn4+ and lattice oxygen content of the catalysts. The surface reducibility and oxygen mobility of the catalysts were investigated using H2-TPR, and presented in Fig. 6 . M0.3 and M0.5 exhibit similar reduction behavior with a broad reduction peaks which can be attributed to the sequential reduction of Mn (IV) to Mn (II): MnO2 → Mn2O3 → Mn3O4 → MnO [22,33]. Conversely, M0, M0.2 and A0.1 M0.5 showed two reduction peaks which are related to the reduction of MnO2 to Mn3O4 (227-252 °C) and Mn3O4 to MnO (294-371 °C) [13,20]. As shown in Fig. 6, the reduction behavior of the catalysts is greatly influenced by their K+ and Mn4+ content. Compared to M0.3, both the main reduction peak and the lower temperature peak (reduction of surface adsorbed oxygen), are shifted to lower reduction temperatures. Similarly, all the reduction peaks of M0.2 are shifted to lower reduction temperatures compared to M0. This indicates that the presence of K+ influences the reduction of Mn and enhance the activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen [18]. The low-temperature reducibility could be attributed to the weakening of the Mn-O bond and enhanced oxygen mobility as in accordance with the XPS and Raman results. This shows that the lattice oxygen is easily mobilized and activated to react with H2 in the presence of K+, as previously reported [5,19,37]. The presence of K+ in MnO2 catalysts weakens the Mn-O bond and increases the electron density around the lattice oxygen, which increases their electron acceptance potential, reducibility and activity [13,19,39]. It is however important to note that, compared to M0.5, A0.1 M0.5 showed a lower reduction temperature for the surface adsorbed oxygen, which could be ascribed to the created oxygen vacancies due to the acid treatment [26], in accordance with the XPS and Raman result. Nonetheless, it exhibited higher temperature reduction profile, further demonstrating the role of K+ in enhancing the activity and mobility of lattice oxygen. Catalytic activity for HCHO oxidation Oxidation reaction (O2 rich environment) The results of the oxidation reaction (60,000 ml·g-1 h-1, ∼170 ppm of HCHO, ∼ 45% relative humidity) are presented in Fig. 7 a, while Fig. 7b presents the results of the room temperature oxidation and stability tests (10 ppm HCHO, 60,000 ml·g-1 h-1, ∼ 45% relative humidity, 30 °C) of M0.5 and A0.1 M0.5 for 72 hrs continuous test. The temperatures for 50 % (T50) and 90 % (T90) conversion were used to compare the catalysts. As shown in Table 3 , the T50 values for the pristine catalysts are 36 °C, 56 °C, 64 °C and 107 °C, while T90 values are 64 °C, 68 °C, 77 °C and 118 °C, for M0.5, M0.3, M0.2 and M0, respectively. Therefore the order of increasing activity is as follows: M0.5 > M0.3 > M0.2 > M0. It is interesting to observe that both M0.5 and M0.3 attained 100% at 70 °C, however, at lower temperatures, M0.5 showed superior catalytic activity. The trend of increasing catalytic is in agreement with the K+ content of the catalysts and its effect in enhancing the activity of the lattice oxygen of the catalysts, as observed in the Raman, XPS and H2 TPR results. It should also be noted that similar catalytic activity was observed over M0.5, M0.6, and M0.8, as shown in Fig. S8, possibly due to their similar content of K+, as no increase in K+ concentration was observed beyond M0.5 Table S1. To further investigate the effect of K+, the acid-treated catalysts were evaluated under the same conditions as the pristine catalysts. As seen in Fig. 7a (dashed lines), the overall catalytic activities of all the acid-treated catalysts drastically reduced after the acid treatment. The T50 values for A0.1 M0.3 and A0.1 M0.2 are 71 °C and 74 °C respectively, while the corresponding T90 values for A0.1 M0.5, A0.1 M0.3 and A0.1 M0.2 are 87 °C, 86 °C and 94 °C. It is, however, important to mention that despite the observed decrease in the overall catalytic activity, an initial increase in activity was observed on all the acid-treated catalysts. This could be ascribed to the enhanced reducibility of the surface adsorbed oxygen and the generation of oxygen vacancies after acid treatment, as seen in the XPS and H2-TPR results. This observation further buttresses the role of surface adsorbed oxygen species in enhancing the catalytic oxidation of HCHO, as previously reported [20,35]. Nevertheless, a slowdown in the activity of the acid-treated catalysts is observed after prolonged exposure to HCHO. This could be related to the depletion of surface adsorbed oxygen, and the reduced ability of the acid-treated catalysts to mobilize lattice oxygen and/or activate water and oxygen molecules into oxygen species due to the absence of K+. The observed lower reducibility and increase in the binding energy of the lattice oxygen of A0.1 M0.5 could be a plausible explanation. The removal of K+ results into reduction in the electron density around the lattice oxygen and the reduction in the content of Mn4+. At lower reaction temperature (< 50 °C) and exposure time, the higher concentration of surface active oxygen species of the acid-treated catalysts enhanced their catalytic activities. However, after the consumption of the surface active oxygen species (< 50 °C), the replenishment of the consumed species depends on the migration and activation of the lattice oxygen [5], which is facilitated by the presence of K+ and the abundance of the lattice oxygen. HCHO oxidation, like many other VOCs, follows the Mars-van Krevlin (MvK) reaction mechanism [40,41], as such, the redox properties of the metal oxide (Mn in this case) and the lattice oxygen mobility play a very vital role in the reaction. The MvK mechanism involves the consumption of lattice oxygen by the reactant (catalyst reduction) and the replenishment of the consumed oxygen by molecular oxygen (catalyst re-oxidation) [41,42]. High content Mn4+ enhances the redox cycle of Mn and the transfer of lattice oxygen to promote the catalytic oxidation of HCHO and other VOCs, by facilitating the cyclic redox reaction (Mn4+ ↔ Mn3+) to supplement consumed lattice and surface active oxygen during the catalytic oxidation process [10,13,14,17,35]. The activation and transfer of lattice oxygen to Mn is critical to completing the redox cycle and enhances catalytic oxidation process [10]. Zhang et al.[15] noted that the abundance of lattice oxygen in δ-MnO2 is critical for HCHO oxidation. Wu et al.[13] also illustrated the prime role of lattice oxygen and its mobility for the oxidation of o-xylene over α-MnO2. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of cryptomelane octahedral molecular sieve MnO2 for the oxidation of benzene was attributed to enhanced mobility of lattice oxygen [37]. As such, the lattice oxygen activity, which is influenced by K+ content and abundance of lattice oxygen, to complete the redox cycle of Mn, plays a central role in HCHO oxidation. Here, we observed a strong correlation between catalytic activity and surface concentration of lattice oxygen, whose activity is enhanced by K+. Potassium activates molecular oxygen and water to replenish the supply of consumed oxygen species through an electron transfer to oxygen [19]. The lattice oxygen mobility of OMS-2 significantly increases with a corresponding increase in K+ concentration through electronic delocalization effect [37].The presence of K+ weakens the Mn-O bonds of manganese oxide thereby enhancing reducibility and mobility of the lattice oxygen as shown by the Raman, XPS and H2-TPR results, and the observed catalytic activity trend with increasing K+ concentration. High oxidation state of Mn (Mn4+) favors the catalytic oxidation of HCHO and other VOCs [10,13,14]. Zhang et al.[15] observed that amongst the various crystal phases of MnO2, the catalyst with the highest ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ showed the best activity for HCHO oxidation. Similar observations were reported for MnO2 based catalysts with varying content of Mn4+ for the o-xylene oxidation [13], PdOx supported manganese oxide catalysts for CO oxidation [16], and Ag modified Mn-La oxides for methane oxidation [17]. Tang et al.[10] also reported that higher oxidation state Mn (Mn4+) and rich lattice oxygen, are responsible for the high catalytic activity of MnO2-CeO2 composites for HCHO oxidation. A similar phenomenon is observed here. As such, it is rational to deduce that abundant lattice oxygen and higher Mn4+ content are favorable for HCHO oxidation, and that K+ facilitates the activity of the lattice oxygen. The consumed lattice oxygen are subsequently replenished by the activation of molecular oxygen and water molecules through an electron transfer from K+ to oxygen [17,19]. It is also noteworthy to mention that despite the significant improvement in the surface area of the acid-treated catalysts, no correlation was observed between the surface area and catalytic activity. In effect, a negative relationship was observed between surface area and activity in the pristine catalysts and their acid-treated counterparts. The effects of surface area and physical adsorption were further evaluated by determining the specific reaction rates [22,35]. As observed in Table 3, the specific rates of all the catalysts decreased drastically after the acid treatment. From the above observation, it is obvious that the catalytic activity is independent of the catalysts’ surface area. Furthermore, as depicted in the room temperature HCHO oxidation at 30 °C and stability studies (Fig. 7b), A0.1 M0.5 exhibited higher catalytic activity in the first 15 hrs of the test, after which a sharp decline in activity was observed. The initial higher activity is attributed to its higher content of surface active oxygen species while the sharp decline in activity is related to the depletion of surface active oxygen species and its reduced ability to mobilize and activate lattice oxygen, as earlier noted. Conversely, a relatively stable activity, an average of 68% conversion, was maintained on M0.5 over the 72 hrs of continuous test. To further probe the effect of K+, stability test was also conducted on M0 sample at 30 °C and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. Like the A0.1 M0.5 sample, a catalytic deactivation was also observed. It should however be noted that its lower activity could be related be due to it being predominantly composed of Mn3O4 as shown by the XRD and Raman results (Fig. 1 and 2a). MnO2 was previously shown to be more active than Mn3O4 for HCHO oxidation [3]. In addition, the possible effect of surface contamination from residual acid on the deactivation and reduced activity was investigated by subjecting the acid-treated samples to further calcination (A0.1 MxH) at 300 °C for 3 hrs and investigated under the similar conditions. Comparison of the activity of the non-calcined acid-treated samples (A0.1 Mx) and the calcined acid-treated samples (A0.1 MxH) (Fig. S9) and the stability test (Fig. S10) showed similar performance trends in both cases. These results further suggest that the observed decline in activity results from the removal of K+. Lattice oxygen test (O2 lean environment) To further underscore the role of K+ in the mobility of lattice oxygen for HCHO oxidation, an oxidation reaction was conducted in the absence of molecular oxygen. The results are depicted in Fig. 8 . To rule out the contribution of external sources of O2 and CO2, pure N2 (99.99%) was used, and blank tests were conducted with no evidence of CO2 in the outlet gas stream. It is clearly evident that even in the absence of molecular O2, deep oxidation of HCHO into CO2 took place, with M0.5 attaining an average conversion of 59% in the first 60 min., while an average of 21.5% was recorded on A0.1 M0.5. The fast and sharp decline in the activity of A0.1 M0.5 is attributed to the depletion of surface active oxygen, as observed earlier in the room temperature and stability test. For M0.5 to achieve high conversion in the absence of molecular oxygen, the supply of such of the consumed oxygen (see Fig. S11) could only have come from its lattice oxygen, as evident by its higher concentration of lattice oxygen in the XPS results (Table 2). This is indicative of its superior ability to mobilize higher amount of lattice oxygen, which is attributed to the effect of K+ in weakening the M-O bonds of MnO2, thereby making the lattice oxygen more active. The participation of the lattice oxygen in HCHO oxidation indicates that the reaction follows MvK reaction mechanism as previously reported [40,41]. As such, a simple oxygen mobility and transfer mechanism is envisaged. As the surface oxygen species are consumed in the reaction, surface oxygen vacancies are created. Sub-surface or bulk lattice oxygen species are mobilized into the created vacancies to replenish the consumed surface oxygen and to sustain the reaction [15,43]. The higher catalytic activity of M0.5 is an indication of the role of K+ in enhancing the mobility of lattice oxygen and the ease of its re-oxidation after reduction by HCHO. The decline in the activity of M0.5, even in the presence of K+, is a result of the increasing difficulty to mobilize inner lattice oxygen. Therefore, the role of K+ is not only limited to the mobility of lattice oxygen but also facilitates the activation of molecular oxygen to replace the consumed oxygen species [19], as evidenced by the higher activity and stability of the K+ rich catalysts in the presence of molecular oxygen (Fig. 7a and b). The XPS result of the spent catalysts (Fig. S12) shows a drastic drop in the surface concentration of lattice oxygen species compared to the fresh catalyst samples (Table 2). A drop from 70 % to 52.9 % was observed on M0.5, while a corresponding decrease from 62.3 % to 56.2 % was also observed on the spent A0.1 M0.5. This further confirms the consumption of lattice oxygen in the lattice oxygen test with more lattice oxygen consumed on M0.5 as seen in Fig. 8. Surface reaction pathway The reaction pathway and the surface intermediate species formed during HCHO oxidation on M0.5 and A0.1 M0.5 were investigated using in-situ DRIFTS measurements (170 ppm, 30 ml min-1), at room temperature for 60 min.. The DRIFTS results are depicted in Fig. 9 a and 9b for M0.5 and A0.1 M0.5 respectively. No peaks corresponding to molecular HCHO were observed on both samples, indicating that HCHO is instantaneously converted into its intermediate species upon adsorption onto the surface of both catalysts. The strong absorption bands in the range of 3500 – 2900 cm-1 are due to surface strongly bonded hydroxyl groups [44]. The bands at 1570 – 1594, and 1352 cm-1 are respectively assigned to the asymmetric stretching ν (OCO)as and symmetric stretching vibration ν (OCO)s of formate species, while the peaks at 2874 and 1374 cm-1 are attributed to ν(CH) and δ(CH) of formate species [44–46].[21,22] The peaks at 2695 and 2790 cm-1 are related to the symmetric (νs) and asymmetric (νas) CH stretch of dioxymethylene (DOM), 1415 cm-1 for δ(CH) modes, while the peaks 1161 and 1047 cm-1 are associated with the ν (CO) stretch of DOM species [35,46,47]. The peaks at 2326 cm-1 arise from the CO2 stretching vibration, while the peaks at 1484-1493 and 1654 cm-1 are ascribed adsorbed carbonates [20,22,48]. As reaction time increases, from 0 to 60 min., the intensity of both the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of formate species increases, indicating that they are the dominant species through which HCHO is converted into CO2. As seen from Fig. 9a, HCHO is immediately converted into DOM intermediates as it adsorbs onto the surface of M0.5, which is then progressively converted into formates as evidenced by the initial decrease in the intensity of the peaks at 1493 cm-1 and the weakening of 1415 cm-1 after 10 min., followed by the rapid increase in the absorption of the formate peak at 1594 cm-1. Mn4+ serves as active site for the activation of HCHO and the generation of DOM species, from the reaction of HCHO and surface lattice oxygen. The generated DOM species are further converted into formates through oxidative dehydrogenation [3,49]. A further reaction of the formates with surface OH- generates CO2 and H2O. Surface OH- could be generated from the reaction of surface lattice oxygen and H+ from the oxidative dehydrogenation of DOM [5], or from the reaction of water molecules with surface oxygen at the oxygen vacancy sites [22,35]. However, while DOM species were clearly observed on the surface of M0.5, only a very weak feature related to the ν (CO) stretch (1047 cm-1) of DOM was observed on A0.1 M0.5 (Fig. 9b). The initial higher activity of A0.1 M0.5 (high and room-temperature tests) could be attributed to the direct formation of formates from the nucleophilic attack of HCHO by surface active oxygen [50], or the faster rate of DOM conversion into formates then to carbonate due its higher density of surface adsorbed oxygen [22,35], as shown by the XPS results. During the HCHO oxidation, surface oxygen species are continuously consumed and replenished [5,48,51]. After the depletion of surface oxygen, their replenishment largely depends on the activation and transfer of lattice oxygen [5]. The Raman, XPS and H2-TPR results suggest that the presence of K+ enhances the mobility of the lattice oxygen. As a result of the weakened interaction between Mn-O, due to the presence of K+, lattice oxygen is easily mobilized to re-oxidize the reduced Mn (Mn4+ ↔ Mn3+), thus replenishing the consumed surface oxygen. High content of Mn4+ also helps in enhancing the cyclic redox behaviour of Mn [10,18]. Through an electron transfer from K+, molecular oxygen is activated into lattice oxygen in the created oxygen vacancies [5,19], thus sustaining the supply of oxygen species for the conversion of HCHO into its intermediate species, as depicted in Fig. 10 . Therefore the catalytic oxidation ability, to a large, depends on the activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen to replenish the consumed surface oxygen and re-oxidize the reduced Mn. As such, the observed progressive deactivation of the A0.1 Mn (0.1) catalyst (Fig. 7b), can be attributed to the continuous depletion of the surface oxygen and its inability to sustain continuous supply, as opposed to M0.5, which even though exhibited lower initial conversion, sustained an average room-temperature of 68% over 72 hrs of continuous test, and achieved complete conversion of high concentration of HCHO (170 ppm) at lower temperature. Conclusion The morphological structure, and the content of K+, Mn4+, and lattice oxygen of MnOx catalysts can be methodically controlled by adjusting the ratio of KMnO4 and Mn(NO3)2 in the reaction mixture. High surface content of Mn4+ enhances the cyclic redox behavior of the catalyst, while K+ enhances the lattice oxygen activity and helps in the activation of molecular oxygen and to replace the consumed lattice oxygen, thereby enhancing activity for HCHO oxidation. On the other hand, the abstraction of K+, via acid treatment, led to the creation of vacancies and an increase in concentration surface active oxygen species, resulting into an initial enhancement of catalytic activity. However, due to the absence of or at low K+ concentration, lattice oxygen mobility and the activation of molecular and/or water molecules, to replace the consumed surface active oxygen, is impacted, leading to reduced catalytic activity. In addition, lattice oxygen test shows that the catalysts lattice oxygen is consumed during the HCHO oxidation process. Despite the increase in surface area of the acids-treated catalysts, and surface area variation of the pristine catalysts, no correlation was observed between surface area and catalytic activity. Catalytic activity increases with increasing K+ content, and the surface concentration of lattice oxygen and Mn4+. M0.5 with the highest concentration of K+, Mn4+, and lattice oxygen exhibited the best catalytic activity, attaining complete conversion of HCHO at 70 °C (170 ppm GHSV of 60,000 ml/g·h), while similar conversion was attained by A0.1 M0.5 at 100 °C. Room temperature tests conducted at 30 °C under a continuous flow of ∼10 ppm HCHO showed that M0.5 is stable for up to 72 hrs with an average conversion of 68%, while fast deactivation was observed on A0.1 M0.5. The stability and ability of the K+ rich catalyst (M0.5) to sustain room temperature oxidation of HCHO are attributed to the lattice oxygen mobility and oxygen/water activation effect of K+ to replace the consumed lattice oxygen. Conversely, the fast deactivation of the acid-treated catalyst, despite possessing higher content surface active oxygen, was attributed to the depletion of the surface oxygen species, and lower activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen to sustain the replenishment of active oxygen species, due to low K+ content.

        "dc:description": "Manganese oxide catalysts with self-modulating K+ content and tunable concentration of lattice oxygen and Mn4+ were synthesized and investigated for HCHO oxidation. The preparation method affects the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of the catalysts. Herein, the role of K+ in enhancing the lattice oxygen mobility of manganese oxide catalysts for enhanced formaldehyde (HCHO) is presented. The presence of K+ enhances the redox properties of Mn and promotes catalytic activity by enhancing the mobility of the lattice oxygen and sustaining the availability of surface active oxygen to sustain the reaction. Catalytic activity was observed to improve with increasing K+ content and the surface concentration of lattice oxygen and Mn4+. A drastic reduction in catalytic activity was observed in the acid-treated samples, with low K+ concentration. Characterization results indicate that the presence of K+ enhances activity and mobility of the lattice oxygen by the weakening the Mn-O bond in manganese oxide and promotes the redox properties of the catalyst. The absence of K+ impacted the mobility of the lattice oxygen and the ability of the catalyst to supplement the consumed oxygen species, resulting into reduced catalytic activity and deactivation in the room-temperature (30 °C) activity and stability test.",
