Graphical abstract Liquid bio-oil formed from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass needs further upgradation by CC bond formation reaction between the phenolic compounds and small oxygenates to retain the maximum amount of carbon in the fuel range (C10 C13), prior to hydrodeoxygenation step. In this contribution, we have explored the gas-phase alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol over zeolites like HZSM5, HBEA, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY solid acid catalysts. The fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption, ICP-MS, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, SEM, and TEM techniques. The time-on-stream and temperature studies were carried out over these catalysts at a WHSV value of 2.8h−1 to analyze the role of different active acidic sites as well as their pore dimensions on the catalytic activity and product distribution. Among all the catalysts, formation of thymol by C-alkylation was highly dominant over ZnY which has strong Lewis acid sites. Coke analysis revealed that HBEA was found to rapidly deactivate by coking (16.4% coke) and pore blocking. Time-on-stream study at 250°C showed that maximum conversion of m-cresol (92%) was obtained on fresh ZnY catalyst having strong Lewis acidity and moderate Bronsted acidity, confirming the fact that strong Lewis acidity in combination with Bronsted acidity improved the stability of iso-propyl cation and consequently, enhanced the conversion of m-cresol. Moreover, the presence of Zn2+ content in FAU zeolite framework was found to alter its acid site distribution and pore volume as compared to HY zeolite and resulted in predominant mono-alkylated product formation, especially thymol. Keywords Biomass Alkylation Thymol m-Cresol iso-propylation Solid acid catalysts Zeolites Introduction During last few decades, fossil fuels have been the resource of choice to meet the energy and chemical demands [1]. However, with rapid depletion of these fossil fuel reserves and their ever-increasing need, the interest has turned towards utilization of alternative renewable energy resources [1–4]. In recent years, lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as an abundant and sustainable alternative energy resource to replace the declining fossil fuels for producing biofuels and valuable chemicals. Among the various methods available, fast pyrolysis is an appropriate process which converts a large amount of biomass into liquid bio-oil which contains small oxygenates (acids, aldehydes, ketones), sugar derived compounds and phenolics [4–7]. However, an upgradation is required because of their degradation with time and temperature due to the presence of hundreds of compounds with different functional groups, mostly oxygenated [8]. Among several bio-oil upgradation processes [9–11], hydrodeoxygenation at high pressure is proved to be an efficient way to remove oxygen and thus increase the stability of these bio-oils [12,13]. However, this process fails to retain the small oxygenates which constitute a significant carbon fraction and they are lost as light gases. Therefore, to retain the carbon fractions in the liquid product, CC coupling by alkylation between the small oxygenates and the phenolic compound is beneficial before performing hydrodeoxygenation [12,13]. For instance, iso-propanol, derived from acetone, can be alkylated with phenolic fraction of the bio-oil to produce alkylphenols in the desirable fuel range (C10 C13) which on further deoxygenation gives drop-in fuel components [14,15]. Further to their use as fuels, these alkylphenols are also widely used as chemical intermediates in the synthesis of antioxidants, fragrances, cosmetics, agrochemicals, and fuel additives [16–18]. In this context, m-cresol and iso-propanol are chosen as the model substituents of lignin-derived phenolics and small oxygenates, respectively. The alkylation of m-cresol is an important acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction for the production of alkyl aromatics. Using iso-propanol as the alkylating agent the disadvantages of transportation of light gases can be overcome. The main product is 2-isopropyl-5-methyl phenol (IMP), also known as thymol, is the main precursor of pharmaceutically important product called menthol which is used as antioxidant, insecticide, insect and animal repellent, fungicide, and medical disinfectant [19,20]. Other products formed are iso-propyl 3-methylphenyl ether (IPMCE), isomers of thymol (4-isopropyl 3-methylphenol (4I-3MP) and 3-isopropyl 5-methylphenol (3I-5MP)), and dialkylated m-cresols as shown in Scheme 1 . A number of different types of catalysts have been reported earlier for the synthesis of thymol by alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol like zinc aluminate spinel, metals loaded on mesoporous materials, γ-alumina, mesoporous solid superacidic materials, cation-exchange resins, mineral acids, Lewis acids, modified zirconia, ionic liquids, calcined Mg-Al hydrotalcites, iron catalyst containing Cr, Si, and K oxides, etc. [15–18,21–30] However, the use of mineral acids and Lewis acids leads to problems like equipment corrosion, environmental pollution, increasing waste disposal costs, low reactant to catalyst ratio, and loss of selectivity to the desired product [31]. Homogeneous ionic liquid catalysts have difficulties in product purification and catalyst recovery [20]. Reported mesoporous materials and other solid acidic catalysts have the advantages like high reactivity, corrosion-free, environment-friendly, easy separation of the products, excellent reusability, etc. However, they pose disadvantages like rapid deactivation due to leaching of active metals, pore blocking due to coke formation, etc. The cation-exchanged resins exhibit good performance, but they are thermally unstable and foul at the higher reaction temperature. It is reported that O-alkylation is favored over strong Bronsted acid sites while C-alkylation is promoted by the both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites when present simultaneously [32,33]. Though the alkylation of phenol with several alkylating agents have been studied widely over solid acid catalysts [32–35], yet sufficient information are lacking, mainly, about the structure-activity relationship of these catalysts with the conversion and product selectivity. Among the reported heterogeneous catalysts, zeolites are considered as environmentally friendly catalysts which contain Bronsted acid sites and have high shape selectivity and thermal/hydrothermal stability which can give a high conversion of m-cresol to form thymol. Hence, for the large scale production of thymol, the zeolite-based catalysts with good thermal stability, least coking issues, and controlled Bronsted and Lewis acidity is to be developed. In the present study, alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol was performed over HZSM5, HBEA, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY zeolites as catalysts. All these zeolite catalysts were chosen based on their varied acid site densities and pore dimensions to investigate the overall effect on alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol. It has been reported in earlier literatures that the ion-exchange of Zinc in zeolites generates the Lewis acid sites by replacing Bronsted acid sites [36]. The objective of this study is to ascertain the effect of the nature and strength of superficial acid sites as well as their pore size on the catalytic activity and product distribution. The acidic properties of the zeolites were determined by NH3-TPD and pyridine-FTIR, and the details of surface and porosity were determined by N2 sorption. The effects of acidity and pore dimensions of zeolites on the reaction are discussed. It is revealed that among all the catalyst used in the present study, zeolite ZnY has a potential application in the production of thymol with high activity and selectivity. Experimental Materials Iso-propanol (99%), m-cresol (98%), and zinc acetate dihydrate (99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd, India. Sodium aluminate, silica, sodium hydroxide (97%) and hexamethyleneimine were purchased from Merck Specialties Pvt. Ltd, India. All chemicals were of analytical reagent (A.R.) grade. These were used as received without any further purification unless otherwise mentioned. Catalyst preparation Commercial samples of zeolites HZSM5 (Si/Al=30), HBEA (Si/Al=12.5), and HY (Si/Al=2.4) from Zeolyst International were used. The zinc ion-exchanged HY zeolite was prepared by ion-exchange method, where, HY zeolite was treated with 0.05M aqueous solution of zinc acetate dihydrate maintaining the liquid to solid weight ratio of 10 [36]. The solution was then refluxed for 8h. Then the obtained mixture was filtered, washed, and dried at 120°C for 8h. The above steps were repeated twice to obtain maximum ion-exchange. Finally, the catalyst was calcined at 550°C for 4h. This calcined zinc ion-exchanged HY catalyst was designated as ZnY. Zeolite HMCM22 (Si/Al=15) was synthesized using the procedure mentioned in earlier reported literature [37]. Catalyst characterization BET surface area and micropore volume of the zeolite catalysts were measured by physisorption of N2 at −196°C in a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosity analyzer. The chemical composition of the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) instrument (Agilent 7900). The structure and phase purity of all the acidic zeolite catalysts were determined by the X-ray diffractometer instrument (Rigaku MiniFlex-300) using Cu Kα source (1.5429Å) and the 2θ range of 5−90° with 4°/min scan rate. Surface acidic site density was determined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 in a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2720 Pulse Chemisorption system instrument. The samples were treated at 500°C in He gas for 2h, then cooled down to 90°C, and finally exposed to a 10% NH3–90% He mixture to eliminate the physisorbed NH3 by flushing with He for 90min. Then the temperature was increased at a rate of 10°min−1 in He flow of 60cm3 min−1 and desorbed NH3 was analyzed by TCD. Nature and strength of the surface acid sites of the catalysts were determined by FTIR studies using pyridine as a probe in a Nicolet-6700 spectrophotometer and spectra were recorded in the range of 1400–1600cm−1 following the reported literature. [38] Prior to the analysis, the samples were powdered and pressed in the form of pellets (35mg) and were saturated with small amount of pyridine. These samples were outgassed in vacuum at 450°C for 2h and then cooled to 25°C under evacuation. Spectra were recorded at this temperature with a resolution of 2cm−1 and considered as a reference. Then, pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature and sequential evacuation was performed at 150°C and 300°C and the spectra were recorded. Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS) in the catalysts give the spectral peaks at 1540cm−1 and 1450cm−1 respectively. Morphological analysis of the samples was performed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, Zeiss Evo 18). SEM images were obtained with a magnification of up to 50,000× . Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) images of the samples was recorded using JEOL JEM-1400 instrument. TEM images were collected with field emission intermediate voltage (120kV), with magnification of up to 12,00,000×. Elemental analysis was performed using Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-ray (EDX, Bruker) instrument. EDX further supports the elements present in the samples as well as the loading of Zn cations on HY in ZnY. The coke formed on the catalysts during reaction was determined by comparing carbon amount of fresh and spent catalysts obtained using CHNS analyzer (Elementar Vario MACRO Cube). Activity testing The gas-phase iso-propylation reactions of m-cresol were carried out in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor with length to diameter (L/D) ratio of ̴ 50. About 1g of each catalyst (0.35–0.42mm) was placed between thin layers of quartz wool and then filled with ceramic beads. The heating furnace was set at the desired reaction temperature and controlled using a k-type thermocouple sensor. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were treated in situ at 500°C for 3h in N2 flow. Then, the reaction mixture with m-Cresol and iso-propanol (iso-propanol to m-cresol molar ratio of 2:1) was fed into the reactor using a syringe pump. The reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure and nitrogen was used as an inert carrier gas. A coiled condenser was connected to the bottom of the reactor to condense the gaseous products. The liquid product was analyzed using a NUCON-GC supplied by AIMIL India Ltd. equipped with a CHROMSORB-WHP (2m×3.175mm×2mm) column and flame ionization detector (FID). The percent conversion of m-cresol (X m- cresol) and percent selectivity to product i (Si; Sthymol for thymol)) was calculated as: X m − cresol = [ Y m − cresol 0 − Y m − cresol Y m − cresol 0 × 100 ] % S i = [ Y i ∑ Y i × 100 ] % Where, Y0 m -cresol and Y m -cresol are the molar fraction of m-cresol in the feed and in the product, and Yi is the molar fraction of products formed from m-cresol. The carbon balance was obtained to be around 97.5% and ring mass balance in each runs was more than 98.3%. Results and discussion Catalyst characterization Table 1 shows the physico-chemical properties of the catalysts used in the alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol. Around 3.2wt% of H+ ions of HY zeolite were exchanged with Zn2+ ions to form ZnY zeolite as determined using ICP-MS data. The surface area and micropore volume of the solid acid catalysts were measured using N2 sorption technique. The exchange of H+ ions with Zn2+ causes the decrease in surface area and micropore volume of the parent HY zeolite because the larger Zn2+ preferentially sits inside the micropore of HY [36]. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the zeolites showed the characteristic peaks in the 2θ range of 2–90° as shown in Fig. 1 . HZSM5 showed a typical pattern of MFI structure with diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 8, 9, 14.6, 23, 23.9, and 30° corresponding to peaks (101), (200), (301), (501), (303), and (503) respectively [39]. HMCM22 showed the diffraction peaks at 10, 23.7, 26.8° for the hkl planes (102), (220), and (310) [40]. HBEA showed mainly two diffraction peaks at 8° and 22.5° which corresponds to (101) and (302) hkl planes, respectively [41]. HY zeolite showed the characteristic diffraction peaks of FAU structure at 2θ of 16.5, 19.4, 21, 24.5, 28, 32, and 34.8° corresponding to major peaks (331), (333), (440), (533), (642), (751), and (664) respectively [42]. ZnY showed the additional peaks of Zn at 16.5 (002), 19.5 (101), 24.5 (102), and 34.8° (112) along with the characteristic peaks present in HY and thus confirms the presence of ion-exchanged Zn2+ ions in HY zeolites [36]. The average crystallite size (d) of the catalysts was calculated following the Debye-Scherrer formula ( d = k λ β C O S θ ) , where k=0.9 is the shape factor, λ is the X-ray wavelength of Cu Kα radiation (1.5429Å), θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and β is the full width at half maximum height (FWHM) of the diffraction peak. The calculated average particle size of HZSM5, HBEA, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY zeolites were 7.9nm, 11.6nm, 13.7nm, 19.7nm, and 40.6nm respectively. The strength and density of the acidic sites of the catalysts were determined by TPD of NH3 pre-adsorbed as the temperature increased. The NH3 desorption profile as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2, the peaks at low and high temperature region correspond to weak and strong acid sites respectively. The interaction between NH3 and catalyst active sites is weak at weaker acidic sites such that the NH3 gets desorbed when heated at lower temperature while strong interaction between NH3 and strong acid sites leads to desorption of NH3 at higher temperature [43]. However, the peaks in this range can be attributed to the presence of both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites [44,45]. The lower temperature NH3-desorption peak corresponding to Lewis acidic sites appeared at around 180°C for all the zeolite samples. The higher temperature NH3-desorption peak corresponding to Bronsted acidic sites appeared at 397°C, 350°C, 320°C, 340°C for HZSM5, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY respectively [44]. The analysis of desorbed NH3 revealed that HBEA has a broad desorption band at around 310°C. TPD curve of HY exhibited strong Lewis and weak Bronsted acidic peak at around 180–190°C and a shoulder at about 320°C corresponding to strong Bronsted acidic peaks for desorption of NH3 [36]. In presence of Zn2+ ions in ZnY zeolite, stronger Lewis acidic peak at around 190–193°C was observed along with a small shoulder at 340°C corresponding to weaker Bronsted acidity as compared to HY [36]. The densities of the surface acid sites were obtained by deconvolution and integration of NH3 TPD graphs and are presented in Table 2 (Fig. S3 in Supplementary information). On a weight basis, zeolites HZSM5, HBEA, and HMCM22 exhibited similar densities of surface acid sites (between 445 and 520μmolg−1). Zeolite HY showed a high concentration of acid sites per gram (1305μmolg−1) which may be attributed to higher aluminium content. The highest surface acid density was exhibited by ZnY (1589μmolg−1) which is probably due to the loading of zinc content on silica-alumina surface. The nature and strength of the surface acid sites of the zeolites were determined by FTIR of adsorbed pyridine after its adsorption at room temperature and sequential evacuation at 25°C, 150°C and 300°C. The FTIR spectra of the zeolites after evacuation at 150°C are shown in Fig. 3 . In case of acidic zeolites, pyridine is adsorbed on the Bronsted acid sites in the form of pyridinium ions and shows adsorption peaks at around 1540, 1480–1500, and 1630cm−1, whereas pyridine is bonded coordinatively on Lewis acid sites and shows characteristics peaks at 1440–1460, 1480–1500 and 1600cm−1 [46]. The relative concentration of Lewis and Bronsted acid sites were obtained by deconvolution and integration of pyridine absorption bands as shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. S4 in supplementary information) at around 1450 and 1540cm−1, respectively, and the results are presented in Table 2. In case of zeolite HZSM5, two overlapping peaks of adsorbed pyridine on Lewis acid sites at 1445 and 1455cm−1 were observed which is probably due to generation of aluminium during calcination in the zeolite framework causing partial hydrolysis of AlO bonds [47]. Besides, similar and significant concentration of adsorbed pyridine on Lewis and Bronsted acid sites of HZSM5 were present (CL/CB =0.9) after evacuation at 150°C and 300°C, indicating the presence of strong Lewis and Bronsted acid sites [40]. On zeolite HBEA, peak at 1450cm−1 is the pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites while peaks at 1540cm−1 and a band splitting into two peaks at around 1630cm−1 are for pyridine adsorbed on Bronsted acid sites (Fig. 3). The amount of pyridine adsorbed at Bronsted acid site is comparatively higher than the Lewis acid site (Table 3 ) on HBEA. The IR spectra in Fig. 3 show that HMCM22 exhibits the characteristic peaks for pyridine adsorption at 1450cm−1 corresponding to Lewis sites and 1540cm−1 and 1620cm−1 corresponding to Bronsted sites. Table 2 shows that this zeolite has the highest concentration of Bronsted acid sites and thus the lowest CL/CB ratio (i.e. 0.2) at both evacuation temperatures. The IR spectrum of HY zeolite displays sharp peaks of pyridine adsorption on both acid sites type which means that HY is a strong acidic zeolite (Fig. 3 ). It can be seen from Table 2 that the CL/CB ratio of HY increases with the evacuation temperature from 1.5 (150°C) to 2.3 (300°C) which suggests that some of the bridged hydroxyl groups that represents the Bronsted sites in the structure is weaker in strength [33]. Nonetheless, rest of the Bronsted acid sites exhibit strong acidity either due to bridging OH group interaction with Lewis sites or OH groups present on extra-framework [48]. Moreover, the strong Lewis acidity of this zeolite is associated with aluminium present either extra-framework (tetracoordinated) or with framework defects (tricoordinated) [49]. The presence of ion-exchanged Zn2+ ions in ZnY zeolite decreases the intensity of peak at 1540cm−1 due to decreased Bronsted acidity while increases the intensity of peaks at 1450cm−1 and 1610cm−1 due to increase in the strength of Lewis acidity, as evidenced from Fig. 3. The CL/CB ratio of ZnY increased from 13.9 (at 150°C) to 40.3 (at 300°C) which indicate that stronger Lewis acidity is developed in the catalyst by ion exchange with zinc. The SEM images of the zeolites were used to visualize the crystal morphology as shown in Fig. 4 . HZSM5 zeolites exhibited an anomalistic ellipsoidal shape with rough surfaces and ill-defined particles [50]. HBEA displayed a close-packed crystal structure which is constructed from smaller particles (10–30nm) [51]. HMCM22 showed thin plate-like shape morphology, a characteristic of MCM family [52]. The SEM images of HY and ZnY revealed polygonal like morphology. In ZnY, most of the Zn is present in ion-exchanged form well matched with earlier literature reports [36]. The average particle diameter as measured from SEM images were found to be 8.1, 12.5, 14.3, 19.1, and 39.9nm for zeolites HZSM5, HBEA, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY, respectively, which is in accordance with the average crystallite size obtained from XRD patterns. The crystal morphology of the zeolites is further demonstrated through TEM images as shown in Fig. 5 . The TEM image of HZSM5 contains numerous dark spots probably due to high content of silica in the sample. HBEA is present in the form of cluster made of smaller particles (10–30nm in size), justifying the SEM data. HMCM22 is displayed as very thin sheets. TEM image of HY zeolite shows that it is highly dispersed probably due to the presence of high aluminium content. The dispersed particles of HY seemed to be aggregated after Zn exchange to form ZnY zeolite. Catalytic activity results for iso-propylation of m-cresol Catalyst activity and deactivation The catalytic activity of all the catalysts was tested in gas phase iso-propylation of m-cresol at 250°C temperature and 2.98h−1 WHSV. The conversion of m-cresol (X m -cresol) and selectivity (Si) to the alkylated products with respect to time for the catalyst ZnY to demonstrate the time-on-stream behavior of the catalyst are shown in Fig. 6 . From the graph, it is evident that conversion of m-cresol declined with the progress of the reaction due to in situ catalyst deactivation. The deactivation of catalyst can be attributed to the formation of coke due to side/parallel reactions and pore blocking on the catalyst [38]. Selectivity to thymol decreased from an initial value of 60% to 33% after 4h of the reaction. On the other hand, selectivity to dialkylated products increased from 13% to 37%, essentially at the expense of thymol. Selectivity to 4I-3MP and 3I-5MP attained nearly constant values (17% and 2%, respectively) after 1h of reaction. The Selectivity to IPMCE increased from an initial value of 3% to a constant value of 10% with the progress of the reaction. 3I-5MP and IPMCE were considered as minor products as they were formed in very low amount (<10%) during the entire catalytic run. Also, due to initial lower concentration of dialkylated products, they were considered as secondary products in the reaction. Due to catalyst deactivation as evident from Fig. 6 and Table 3, the respective curves of conversion of m-cresol and products selectivity for all the catalysts were extrapolated to t=0h to assume the catalytic results over fresh catalysts [38,46]. Conversion of m-cresol and selectivity to the alkylated products at 250°C temperature and a WHSV value of 2.8h−1 are shown in Table 3. ZnY catalyst with highest density of predominantly Lewis acidic sites showed a maximum 91.6% conversion of m-cresol, highest among all other catalysts used in this study. Moreover, HY with comparatively lower Lewis and stronger Bronsted acidic sites than ZnY showed 88.9% conversion of m-cresol at t=0h. HBEA with moderate Lewis and Bronsted acidic sites showed almost 83.4% conversion of m-cresol conversion. Although HBEA, HMCM22, and HZSM5 possess similar acid site densities, the latter two showed comparatively lower catalytic activity probably due to their narrow pores causing diffusional limitations of reactants and products. HMCM22 contains a three dimensional pore structure made of 12-membered ring supercages (18.2×7.12×7.1Å) connected together via 10-membered ring windows (4.0×5.5Å) and a two dimensional pore structure made of sinusoidal 10 membered rings (4.0×5.5Å) with no cages [53]. The only molecule which can diffuse through the 10 membered ring pores would be able to reach the internal active supercages of HMCM22 since they are connected to the exterior through 10 membered ring windows [40]. While HZSM5 has three dimensional channels with elliptical aperture (5.1×5.5Å) interconnected by zig-zag channels (5.3×5.5Å cross section) without any cage [38]. The kinetic diameter of m-cresol is 6.53Å [54], which causes difficulty in its diffusion inside the pores of HZSM5 and HMCM22 zeolites. Whereas, the pore structures of HBEA, HY, and ZnY are larger than the kinetic diameter of m-cresol, facilitating the diffusion through the pores. The surface reactions favored the non-selective and kinetically preferred reactions. These experimental results matched with the previously reported work on m-cresol methylation reported by Acevedo et al. [38]. In terms of the conversion of m-cresol with the progress of the reaction, we can infer that all samples were deactivated on stream due to side reactions of reactants or products. The coke deposited on the catalysts after reaction was analyzed by CHNS analyzer and the coke% is listed in Table 3. HBEA formed the highest amount of coke (16.4%) while similar amount of coke (7.9 and 8.0% respectively) was formed on HMCM22 and HY which showed the similar deactivation percentage, thus confirming the loss in activity is due to coke formation. The coking on the catalysts is further confirmed by SEM images of the fresh (Fig. 4) and spent catalysts as shown in Fig. 7 . Earlier workers have reported that coking is caused by parallel reactions involving alkylating agents [38,46]. Iso-propanol undergoes dehydration and then condensation to form DIPE (diisopropyl ether) on the solid acid catalysts (either Bronsted or Lewis sites) and self-oligomerized to form light hydrocarbons and aromatics which are considered as the coke precursors. Supplementary experiments were performed on ZnY to test whether coke can be formed by iso-propanol or m-cresol independently or their simultaneous presence is needed. The reactants iso-propanol and/or m-cresol were fed in a N2 stream over ZnY sample. The carbon percent deposited on the sample after 4h of reaction and also the carbon deposited during iso-propanol/m-cresol reactions under similar reaction conditions were analyzed by CHNS as shown in Table 4 . The amount of carbon deposited was obtained to be lower when ZnY was fed individually with iso-propanol or m-cresol (2.2 or 1.8%) as compared to the amount of carbon deposited when both the reactants were fed simultaneously (8.8%). Hence, reactions that involve both the reactants and also likely the retention of alkylated products were the cause of coke deposition on the catalyst. Product distribution The selectivity to the alkylated products on iso-propylation of m-cresol was compared on fresh catalysts and is included in Table 3. The main products formed were iso-propyl 3-methylphenyl ether (IPMCE) and mono-C-alkylated m-cresols (Thymol, 3I-5MP, and 4I-3MP). Di-alkylated m-cresols were observed to be the secondary products using these catalysts. The formation of minute amount of dialkylated products by HZSM5 can be attributed to the small pore structure which restricts bulky intermediates formation. ZnY showed the highest selectivity to monoalkylated products at t=0h (94%) and very low amount of dialkylated products (3%) were obtained. However, with time on stream some of these monoalkylated products further form CC bond with iso-propanol and converts into dialkylated products, thereby, increasing their amount at the end of the reaction as shown in Fig. 6. The ratio between the C-alkylation products and the O-alkylation products (C/O-ratio) was calculated for each of the catalysts used in this work and is plotted in Fig. 8 (a). The highest amount of IPMCE was formed by HZSM5 giving the lowest value of C/O-alkylation ratio (i.e. 1.3) followed by HBEA, HMCM22, and HY (2.3, 6.1, and 8.1 respectively). On the contrary, ZnY formed majorly C-alkylated products which gives a C/O alkylation ratio of 32.3. This indicates that stronger Lewis acidic sites favor the alkylation in aromatic ring forming the desired product. Grabowska et al. mentioned the similar observation of selective C-alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol by using Lewis acidic ZnAl2O4 catalysts. [16] Fig. 8(b) shows the ratio of thymol to iso-thymol (4I-3MP+3I-5MP) alkylation selectivity calculated for each catalyst at t=0h. ZnY with the highest ratio produced thymol four times than its other two isomers, whereas, lowest ratio was found for HBEA (0.4) due to formation of majority of 3I-5MP by this catalyst. The thymol/iso-thymol selectivity ratio for HZSM5, HMCM22, and HY were in intermediate between HBEA and ZnY (1.6, 1.9, and 0.8, respectively). The distribution of mono-C-alkylated m-cresols into different isomers (thymol, 3I-5MP, and 4I-3MP) is shown in Table 3. The ortho-alkylated product, 2-isopropyl 3-methylphenol (2I-3MP), was not observed probably due to the steric hindrance caused by the −OH group on the first carbon and the −CH3 group on the meta- carbon of the aromatic ring which prevents its formation. Even if minute amount of 2I-3MP (kinetic product) formed at the onset of the reaction, it was readily isomerized to more stable products like thymol or 4I-3MP (thermodynamic products) [55]. Fig. 9 shows the effective kinetic diameters of the three optimized mono-C-alkylated isomer products, thymol, 3I-5MP, and 4I-3MP. Thymol can diffuse at a higher rate than its other isomers through the pore channels of the zeolites owing to smallest effective kinetic diameter (4.57Å). Clearly, thymol was the predominant product over all the catalysts except HBEA for which 3I-5MP was obtained in major amount. The selectivity to 4I-3MP was lower than thymol due to its larger molecular size, albeit significant especially for HY. This can be attributed to the large super cage pore width of HY which reduces the shape selectivity and eases the diffusion of 4I-3MP. In case of ZnY, it has similar pore size as that of HY but the pore volume is reduced due to the incorporation of Zn2+ ions inside the pores. This in turn imparts geometric constraints to other bulkier molecular size products and makes it highly selective only towards thymol. Since both −OH and −CH3 groups attached to the aromatic ring of m-cresol are ortho/para directing groups, the iso-propyl group gets attached to ortho position with respect to −OH group and para position with respect to −CH3 group in thymol whereas vice-versa in case of 4I-3MP. Thus both the products are kinetically favored and thermodynamically stable. On the contrary, 3I-5MP is not kinetically favored but it is thermodynamically more stable and in general it is formed by isomerization of thymol and 4I-3MP. [56] Despite the kinetic limitations, 3I-5MP is detected in highest concentration on HBEA catalyst which may be due to high surface area of HBEA as shown in Table 1 and its 3-dimensional channel system with large pores which readily catalyzes the non-selective reaction. Effect of reaction temperature on iso-propylation of m-cresol Additionally, we have examined the effect of different temperatures on conversion of m-cresol (X m -cresol) and product distribution (Si) on each catalyst. The conversion of m-cresol and selectivity to the alkylated products using different catalysts is shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 10 . The reactions were performed at temperatures 200, 225, 250, 275, and 300°C. For catalysts HZSM5 and HMCM22, the conversion of m-cresol increased from 11% and 18%, respectively at 200°C to 29% and 31%, respectively at 225°C. Further increase in the temperature, resulted in a constant decrease in conversion. However, for the other catalysts HBEA, HY, and ZnY, m-cresol conversion increased till 250°C and then gradually decreased. The conversion of m-cresol at 250°C for catalysts HBEA, HY, and ZnY were found to be 43%, 70%, and 87%, respectively. The decrease in conversion after certain temperature can be attributed to the coke formation and/or occurrence of other parallel reactions. Thymol was found to be more selective than other products over all catalysts except HBEA. These observations are in accordance with the data obtained from time-on-stream study (Table 3). Predominant selectivity to thymol can be attributed to its smaller dimension (as shown in Fig. 8 ) and also higher rate of iso-propylation at the adjacent ortho carbon of m-cresol chemisorbed on the catalyst acidic surface sites through its OH group. Nonetheless, carbons other than 6th positioned carbon are less likely to react with iso-propanol cation due to the steric hindrance caused by the methyl group present on meta position [57]. Yadav et al. have mentioned that C/O-alkylated product ratio depends upon the reaction conditions and the type of catalyst used. O-alkylation reactions are dominated in mild conditions such as lower temperatures and low density and strength of the active acidic sites of the catalysts. Whereas, harsh conditions like high reaction temperature and high density and strength of catalyst’s acidic active sites leads to the formation of C-alkylated products [22]. As evident from the graphs shown in Fig. 10, with increase in reaction temperature, selectivity to IPMCE (O-alkylated product) decreased and selectivity to C-alkylated products increased for all the catalysts. Moreover, strong acidic catalysts (like ZnY) form very low amount of IPMCE (<10% over ZnY) which are in line with the observations of Yadav et al. [22]. Selectivity to 3I-5MP was found to be highest for HBEA which might be the result of different configuration of the aromatic ring on the catalyst surface (proposed by Taylor and Ludlum) [57], otherwise it was formed less selectively over rest of the catalysts. Selectivity to DIPMC was also lower due to small pore structures of the catalysts causing shape selectivity, except HY for which large geometric pore dimensions eases the diffusion of dialkylated products. The presence of 4I-3MP was the result of either rearrangement reaction of IPMCE or isomerization of thymol to form 4I-3MP (para-alkylated product). Among all the catalysts used in this study, ZnY showed highest catalytic activity in terms of conversion of m-cresol (87%) at 250°C. This can be attributed to strong Lewis acidity associated with incorporation of Zn2+ ions on the silica surface [57]. Thymol was obtained as the major product over ZnY owing to its strong acidic sites which prefer C-alkylation especially at the less hindered ortho carbon of aromatic ring of m-cresol. On the other hand, the ether product, IPMCE, was obtained in lower amount which further decreased at high temperatures. The selectivity to 3I-5MP was constant over all the reaction temperatures with negligible slope. Selectivity to 4I-3MP increased due to isomerization of thymol at higher temperatures while selectivity to DIPMC slightly decreased and then became almost constant (10%). The selectivity trends of 3I-5MP and DIPMC showed characteristic secondary products behavior [57]. Overall, a higher m-cresol conversion as well as selectivity to thymol using ZnY at optimum temperature of 250°C depicts its superior performance over the other catalysts. Conclusions Gas-phase alkylation of biomass-derived m-cresol with iso-propanol over a series of solid acidic catalysts was conducted under different reaction conditions and their catalytic activity was compared. The catalytic activity study suggested that the conversion of m-cresol and selectivity to the alkylated products is strongly controlled by the density, nature, and strength as well as the pore structure of the catalytic active acid sites. HBEA with moderate Bronsted and Lewis acid sites showed higher selectivity to 3I-5MP and IPMCE (C/O ratio of 2.3). HY with Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites of good strength showed C/O ratio of 8.1, yet it had almost similar selectivity to thymol and 4I-3MP. Furthermore, by changing the nature and strength of the acid sites, the selectivity to desired products were tuned. For instance, ZnY (strong Lewis acidity) was found to be highly selective towards the C-alkylation (C/O alkylation ratio: 32.3) and especially to the formation of thymol. HMCM22 and HZSM5 showed poor catalytic activity in terms of conversion of m-cresol due to small pore dimensions. Moreover, on HZSM5 the production of dialkylated product was hindered by diffusional constraints. Additionally on HZSM5 and HMCM22, higher selectivity (>50%) to smallest isomer of mono-C-alkylated product, i.e. thymol, could be explained in terms of their shape selectivity. Coke analysis by CHNS showed that all the catalysts form coke (between 6 and 16%) and significant loss in catalytic activity on stream was observed, especially on HBEA. Moreover, experimental results suggested that simultaneous presence of both reactants caused coke formation. Additionally, reaction temperature was also optimized based on the catalytic activity and product distribution and the optimum reaction temperature was obtained to be 250°C for this alkylation reaction. Overall, ZnY catalyst with highest acid density and strongest Lewis acidity along with wide 3-dimensional pore structures was found to be the best catalyst for the reaction in terms of highest m-cresol conversion and exclusive selectivity to the desired product thymol. Hence, it can be concluded that the synergistic effect of the acidity and porosity of a catalyst can highly affect its activity and product distribution in a reaction.

In this contribution, we have explored the gas-phase alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol over zeolites like HZSM5, HBEA, HMCM22, HY, and ZnY solid acid catalysts. The fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption, ICP-MS, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, SEM, and TEM techniques. The time-on-stream and temperature studies were carried out over these catalysts at a WHSV value of 2.8h−1 to analyze the role of different active acidic sites as well as their pore dimensions on the catalytic activity and product distribution. Among all the catalysts, formation of thymol by C-alkylation was highly dominant over ZnY which has strong Lewis acid sites. Coke analysis revealed that HBEA was found to rapidly deactivate by coking (16.4% coke) and pore blocking. Time-on-stream study at 250°C showed that maximum conversion of m-cresol (92%) was obtained on fresh ZnY catalyst having strong Lewis acidity and moderate Bronsted acidity, confirming the fact that strong Lewis acidity in combination with Bronsted acidity improved the stability of iso-propyl cation and consequently, enhanced the conversion of m-cresol. Moreover, the presence of Zn2+ content in FAU zeolite framework was found to alter its acid site distribution and pore volume as compared to HY zeolite and resulted in predominant mono-alkylated product formation, especially thymol.",
