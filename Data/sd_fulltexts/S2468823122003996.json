Developing non-precious metal oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance for storage systems and energy conversion. Pyrolyzation of the bimetallic Mo(IV)-Ni(II) supramolecular coordination polymer (SCP) for the first time by simultaneously introducing Co(II) ion with Graphene Oxide (GO) as template leads to a new outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalyst (GO-Co@MoNi) composed structurally by 2D MoN flake formed in situ and CoNi alloy supported on lamellar GO. The unique components, sheet architecture, and intermetallic synergy of the GO-Co@MoNi catalyst (η = 340 mV, E1/2 = 0.855V) endow it comparable electrocatalytic performance towards OER to the commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts (η = 320 mV) and superior performance towards ORR to Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.84 V) electrocatalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the essential role of trimetallic synergy at an unprecedented “comfortable” 4 × 1e− electrons reaction pathway in the excellent ORR in GO-Co@MoNi. The current research opens a skillful design strategy and a rare catalytic mechanism for constructing new oxygen electrocatalysts, and the results show that the SCP-based materials have great potential in the electrochemical field in the future, especially for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Graphical Abstract The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with superior performance to the commercial noble metal catalyst has been developed for the first time by pyrolyzing the Co(II) ion doped Mo(IV)-Ni(II) supramolecular coordination polymer with GO as template and the DFT calculation revealed the unprecedented 4 × 1e− catalytic reaction mechanism in the trimetallic synergistic catalyst.

Developing low cost, efficient, stable and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for OER and ORR has become one of the major scientific and technological challenges in improving the performance of metal-air batteries and fuel cells [5,6]. To date, double transition metal alloy has been considered to be a kind of suitable electrocatalyst candidate because of the abundant precursors and their high activity in alkaline media [7,8] For example, the NiMn alloy catalysts have been widely studied, leading to some breakthroughs in this direction by modulating the precursor structure and providing some new ideas for further investigation of electrocatalysts [9]. Rational design alloy catalysts with layered structure can promote maximum atom utilization efficiency and make active sites be fully exposed, which can in turn enhance the intrinsic nature of catalysts [10]. As a new class of porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing high crystallinity, regular open-framework structure and long-range order [11,12] have been proven excellent precursors for designing alloy structures with more active sites exposed. Many MOFs-based electrocatalysts have therefore been prepared and functionally investigated [8,9] However, it is difficult to achieve high and stable catalytic activity merely through introducing heteroatoms due to the poor control over the dispersion and uniformity of dopant heteroatoms. To address this issue, significant advances have been made by introducing various hard templates or other promising alternatives to construct layered or tubular nanostructures for further enhancing their ORR or OER performance [8,13]. Layered GO with a large specific surface area and excellent surface performance has been usually used as one of the hard template materials. At present, MOF-based material with GO nanosheet as template stand out as one of the most efficient approaches for constructing high-performance ORR or OER electrocatalysts [14-16]. Nevertheless, most of alloy structures synthesized by MOFs with nanosheets, nanotubes, and nanosphere as template are commonly used as mono-function catalyst, i.e. either ORR or OER, except for few bifunctional ORR and OER catalysts with commonplace electrochemical activity [17-19]. Supramolecular coordination polymers (SCPs) with controllable synthesis methods and adjustable open-framework structures, can be consisting of bimetallic or even trimetallic central ions and a variety of organic ligands constructed by the coordination bonds (CB) and the intermolecular supramolecular interactions including H-bonds, π-π stacking, etc. The shorter spacing between metal ions in SCP with comparison to that in MOFs might be more helpful for producing alloy structure with synergistic catalytic effect. Furthermore, the metal residing on the SCP nodes may be partly exchanged by other metal ions because of the coordination environment provided by the SCP linkers, allowing further adjustment of the spatial distance of metal sites to form alloy structure. Therefore, from a structural point of view, SCPs with similar multi-dimensional framework structures to MOFs may be also promising for the preparation of electrochemical catalyst with high performance. However, to our best of the knowledge, the electrocatalytic activity of the alloy structure resulted from SCPs pyrolysis have barely received attention up to now. Additionally, according the recent report [20], pyrolysis of precursors containing Mo element and GO in the presence of N source tend to generate two-dimensional lamellar MoN loaded on layered GO, and this lamellar MoN can obviously accelerate the rapid ion transport and mass transfer. Along the above ideas, investigation over the SCP-based electrochemical material was carried out and a new high efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst containing 2D layered MoN formed in situ and CoNi alloy has been successfully prepared by one-step pyrolysis with the Co(II) ion doped SCP as precursor and GO as template. For the SCP before pyrolysis, which is constructed by the bimetallic macrocyclic Mo(IV)-Ni(II) complex with combination of strong intermolecular H-bond interactions (Figure S1). Based on the merits of the synergetic effect of CoNi alloy and layered MoN formed in situ with the help of flake GO, the as-obtained material (GO-Co@MoNi) exhibits both high ORR and OER activities with superior ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.855 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and excellent OER overpotential (η) of 340 mV at 10 mA cm−2, as well as robust stability in alkaline media. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of the current catalyst is superior to almost of the SCP-based bifunctional electrochemical oxygen catalyst with few exceptions [21,22]. Obviously, the E1/2 of GO-Co@MoNi is superior to commercial Pt-based (E1/2 = 0.84 V) and the η is very close to RuO2 (η = 320 mV) catalyst, clearly indicating that the SCP-based material is of great potential to replace the precious metal-based catalyst in electrochemistry catalytic field. Meanwhile, unprecedently, the edge of the final ORR catalyzing field has been touched by DFT calculation, discovering that the double-catalyzing process is further divided into the 4 electrons tetra-catalyzing process. 2 Experimental 2.1 General remarks. All the reagents and solvents were reagent grade and used as received. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data was collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (I = 1.54056 Å) at room temperature. SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-6510A scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was measured by HT7700 electron microscope at 100 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) data were collected from PHI 5300 ESCA System (PerkineElmer, USA). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a QuadraSorb SI apparatus at 77.3 K and the surface areas were calculated by the Brunauere Emmette Teller (BET) method. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on the CHI 760E workstation (CH Instruments, Inc.) with a RRDE-3A rotator by employing a typical three-electrode system. Corresponding methods were specified in Supporting Information. 2.2 Experiment details 2.2.1 The preparation of GO-Co@MoNi A acetonitrile solution (10 mL) of [Ni(L)(H2O)2][ClO4]2 (hereafter referred to as 2,6Ni, L = 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo[11.3.1]heptadeca-(17),2,11,13,15-pentaene, Figure S1 (Supporting Information) (0.4 mmol, 206.8 mg) was slowly added to another solution containing K4[MoIV(CN)8] (Figure S1) (0.2 mmol, 109.6 mg) in deionized water (DI-water) (10 mL) and DMF (10 mL) under stirring, resulting in a deep orange precipitate. Then, CoCl2•6H2O (0.4 mmol, 95.17 mg) was added subsequently into the above mixture and aged one night. The obtained suspension was filtered and the solid was then washed and dried to form Co@MoNi-SCP powder. Subsequently, Co@MoNi-SCP (15.0 mg) dissolved in ethanol (20 mL) was slowly added to ethanol (40 mL) containing GO (30 mg) pretreated using an ultrasonic bath for 2 h. The mixture was further treated by ultrasonic operation for 3 h and then subjected to magnetic stirring for two days. After the dispersion procedure, the solution was further exposed to 80 °C in air to obtain GO-Co@MoNi-SCP powder by slow evaporation. The thus obtained material was finally treated with a pyrolysis step in a tube furnace at temperatures from 120 to 800 °C under the N2 atmosphere with a rate of 5 °C/min, affording the GO-Co@MoNi powder. 2.2.2 The preparation for the typical comparison samples The detailed procedure for the preparation of the comparison samples GO-Co@MoNi-1, GO-Co@MoNi-2, GO-Co@MoNi-3, Co@MoNi, Co@MoNi-1, Co@MoNi-2, Mo, MoNi and Co-Mo are given in Supporting Information. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization. The preparation procedure including the simple chemical synthesis and pyrolysis procedure for the GO-Co@MoNi catalyst with layered MoN and CoNi alloy supported on GO was depicted in Fig. 1 . First, in order to prove that SCP was successfully synthesized as a precursor, Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S2, Supporting imformation) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscope (FT-IR) (Figure S3) test were carried out. PXRD results showed that the main peaks of GO-Co@MoNi-SCP and Co@MoNi-SCP were basically consistent with the theoretical PXRD pattern of MoNi-SCP resulted from the single crystal X-Ray diffraction, confirming the existence of SCP in the GO-Co@MoNi-SCP. Additionally, the main peak belonging to GO could be observed at 27.5° in the PXRD of GO-Co@MoNi-SCP. The above results clearly confirm the SCP-based research idea of current work. In the FT-IR of Co@MoNi-SCP and GO-Co@MoNi-SCP, two peaks attributed to the bridge and non-bridge cyanide groups at about 2105 nm−1 and 2144 nm−1 can be found (Figure S3), demonstrating also the MoNi-SCP-based material has been successfully prepared. The FT-IR of K4Mo(CN)8 in combination with CoCl2 confirms that no peaks attributed to the bridging cyanide group can be found, indicating no formation of the cyanide-bridged CoMo-SCP (Figure S3). Then, the pyrolyzed samples containing SCP was studied through a series of characterization. Firstly, the Co@MoNi obtained from the pyrolyzation of Mo(IV)-Ni(II) SCP and CoCl2 contains abundant heteroatom such as Ni, Co, and N atoms dispersion on carbon surface (Figure S5). However, the Co@MoNi is difficultly heated uniformly due to its block structure, which in turn leads to active sites being not easily exposed on the surface. To address this issue, the GO was introduced as template for the purpose of increasing the exposed surface area and maintaining initial morphology after pyrolysis. Additionally, according to the recent research result, the lamellar structure of GO is beneficial to the formation of two-dimensional MoN nanosheets, which are very helpful for facilitating the electron transfer and mass transfer, in the presence of Mo source during pyrolysis process [20]. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) photos (Fig. 2 a-b) show that the formed in situ MoN nanosheets are well encapsulated by GO layers with the observed periodic lattice spacing 0.278 nm, corresponding to the (002) facets of MoN. More importantly, as can be found from the inset of Fig. 2b, the MoN sheet is very close to the CoNi alloy, implying the possible synergistic effect of three metals. Simultaneously, comparison of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of GO, GO-Co@MoNi-SCP, and GO-Co@MoNi, the basic shape of GO is with no obvious change after the pyrolysis experience, revealing the template role of GO for generating the ultrathin 2D morphology (Fig. 2c-e). The ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure enables the generated CoNi alloy dispersing on the porous carbon support (Figs. 2e) and the crystallizing with the lattice spacing of 0.20nm (Figures S6) corresponding to the (111) plane of CoNi alloy, which is consistent also with the XRD results (vide infra). Meanwhile, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping discovers the homogeneous distribution CoNi alloy throughout nanosheets after pyrolysis (Fig. 2f). The porosity of GO-Co@MoNi was evaluated by N2 sorption isotherm measurements at 77 K. As shown in Table S1, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of GO-Co@MoNi (ca 196.17 m2 g−1) is markedly larger than that of Co@MoNi (154.09 m2 g−1), confirming that the addition of GO can not only play indispensable of carrier role but also expose more active sites during the pyrolysis process. The PXRD pattern of GO-Co@MoNi (Fig. 3 a) shows the diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.7°, which corresponds to the (002) plane of graphite. The three diffraction peaks of the GO-Co@MoNi located at 44.52°, 51.83° and 76.22°, respectively, are situated between the characteristic diffraction peaks of Co (PDF#15-0806) and Ni (PDF#04-0850), confirming the existence of the CoNi alloy [23]. In addition, the remaining main peaks can be attributed to MoN (PDF#25-1367), disclosing the generation of such types of the species during the high-temperature treatment, which is also consistent with the TEM results(vide supra). The PXRD and TEM prove that the introduction of Co source to SCP-based materials have been successfully resulted in the formation of the bimetallic CoNi alloy and also indicate the CoNi alloy and 2D MoN in situ formed are well encapsulated by GO layers. The elemental valence states were further conducted by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As can be found in Fig. 3b, the fine C 1s spectrum of GO-Co@MoNi can be deconvoluted into four peaks, corresponding to C-C (283.3 eV), C=C (284.8 eV), C=N/C-O (285.8 eV) and C-C=O (288.6 eV), respectively, suggesting the existence of C atom connected to N and O atoms. Moreover, XPS full spectrum confirms the presence of Mo and N elements (Figure S7a). The detailed analysis around 400 eV reveal the N 1s peak (around 397.5 eV) and Mo-N bonding (centered at around 393.7 eV) (Fig. 3c), unambiguously confirming the formation of MoN [24]. The Mo 3d spectrum of GO-Co@MoNi shows two peaks at 231.5 eV and 228.1 eV (Figure S7b), respectively, which can be assigned to the Mo3+ in MoN supported also by the PXRD and TEM results (vide supra). Meanwhile, by analyzing the Co 2p spectrum of Co@MoNi, two main peaks including Co 2p3/2 (781.68 eV) and Co 2p1/2 (797.58 eV) and two satellite peaks centered at 786.33 and 803.28 eV were found (Figure S7c). For the spectrum of Ni 2p, the two peaks located at 853.7 eV and 856.2 eV can be ascribed to the Ni 2p3/2 (Figure S7d). These results are consistent with previous reported alloy peaks [22], which indicates that CoNi alloy was produced during the pyrolysis process. In addition, it should be noted that, by carefully checking the spectra of Co 2p and Ni 2p after GO being introduced, the binding energy of Co and Ni was shifted to the left by 0.7 eV, which may be caused by the synergy between CoNi alloy and MoN. (Figure S7 c, d). 3.2 Electrocatalytic Activity. Both the ORR and OER electrocatalytic performance of GO-Co@MoNi were conducted in alkaline solutions by using a standard three-electrode system with Mo, CoMo, MoNi, Co@MoNi and benchmark Pt/C (20 %) or RuO2 as references. The experiment results of E1/2 and Jk (the dynamic current density) for Mo, CoMo, MoNi, and Co@MoNi showed that MoNi and Co@MoNi were with relative better ORR catalytic activity (Fig. 4 a). With comparison to MoNi, the LSV curve demonstrated the larger E1/2 and JL for GO-Co@MoNi, indicating that the introduction of Co element enhanced the ORR activity of GO-Co@MoNi under the help of the synergistic effect. Then, the repeated LSV tests by adding different proportions of Co for optimal ORR performance were carried out, and the typical results showed that the Co@MoNi catalyst prepared by pyrolyzing 2,6Ni, CoCl2 •6H2O and K4MoCN8 with the mole ratio of 2:2:1 gave the best ORR performance (Figure S8). The Co doping quantity is in line with the previous results that the 1:1 ratio of Co: Ni can easily form the alloy structure to achieve best electrochemical performance [25-27]. Therefore, this ratio is consequently employed for further detailed study. In order to further verify the proportion of the metallic composition after pyrolysis, inductively coupled plasma massspectrometry (ICP-MS) test was carried out on Co@MoNi and the other two corresponding comparison samples containing different Co doping quantity. The metallic mass fraction of the pyrolyzed samples listed in Table S2 were very closing to the corresponding values before the pyrolysis, indicating that there is no obvious quality loss for the metal composition during the pyrolysis process. The effect of GO was further investigated by the value of E1/2 and kinetic current density (Jk at 0.7 V vs RHE). It was found that the half-wave potential was slightly improved (73 mV) after the addition of GO, which can be attributed to the increased active surface area and sites(vide supra). It should be pointed out that the Jk was markedly increased to 14.495 mA cm−2 after the addition of GO. The significantly increased Jk can be tentatively attributed to the improved synergism and the mass transfer efficiency from the in situ formed 2D MoN, for which it has been proved by the recent report [20] that the MoN nanosheets supported on GO can obviously promote mass transfer. In the same way, the performance of ORR was also evaluated by loading different proportion of GO, and the physical mixing ratio 2:1 (GO: Co@MoNi) was found to be the best stoichiometric proportion corresponding to the best electrochemical performance of GO-Co@MoNi (Figure S9), which has been further used as a representative comparison with other substances. As shown in Fig. 4b, the bar chart shows that GO-Co@MoNi manifests excellent ORR activity with a high E1/2 of 0.855 V vs. RHE and a large Jk of 22.22 mA cm−2, superior to Pt/C (0.840 V, 9.69 mA cm−2) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. For gaining deeper insight into the ORR activity of GO-Co@MoNi, the LSV curves were recorded under a rotation rate from 400 to 2500 rpm (Fig. 4c). The Koutecky−Levich (K-L) plots under different potentials exhibited excellent linearity, revealing the first-order reaction kinetics of GO-Co@MoNi over the O2 concentration in electrolyte (Fig. 4d). The electron transfer number (n) for GO-Co@MoNi was calculated to be 3.87 from the K-L plots, indicating a high-efficiency 4e− reduction pathway. To further accurately verify the n value, RRDE tests were performed and the result confirmed the 4e− reduction process on GO-Co@MoNi with a peroxide yield <17.1% and n>3.65 between 0 and 0.8 V vs RHE (Fig. 4e), which also reflected the efficient ORR performance of GO-Co@MoNi. As shown in the chronoamperometric curve (Fig. 4f), the current density of GO-Co@MoNi was retained 92.7% after 5h, while the commercial Pt/C catalyst exhibits a worse decay (by approximately 85.4%), proving the superior stability of GO-Co@MoNi. In addition to high ORR activity, GO-Co@MoNi also exhibited great OER performance. Along the similar line above, we optimized the OER performance (Figure S10-S11) by introducing different ratio of Co source and GO, and obtained the 2:2:1 ratio of 2,6Ni: CoCl2 •6H2O: K4MoCN8 with the best OER performance after the repeated experiment. The bar graph (Fig. 5 a, b) showed that GO-Co@MoNi initially drove OER at a low onset potential (E0) of 1.57 V vs. RHE and then delivered 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential (η10) of 340 mV, much superior to CoMo (510 mV), MoNi (500 mV) and Co@MoNi (400 mV). These results manifested that the simultaneous addition of Co(II) ion and GO is very helpful for improving the OER activity and the η10 = 340 mV is very close to that of RuO2 (320 mV), proving the outstanding OER catalytic activity of GO-Co@MoNi. In addition, with comparison to Mo (310.34 mV/dec−1), CoMo (129.06 mV/dec−1), MoNi (100.59 mV/dec−1) and Co@MoNi (141.2 mV/dec−1), a smaller 98.81 mV/dec−1 Tafel slope is obtained for GO-Co@MoNi (Fig. 5c) that is close to RuO2 (89.88 mV/dec−1), confirming its favourable OER kinetics. The much smaller η10 and lower tafel slop of GO-Co@MoNi, compared to CoMo, MoNi and Co@MoNi, demonstrated that its unique hierarchically porous structure, which facilitate the oxygen diffusion and mass transfer as well as the exposure of more active sites, can significantly enhance OER activity. It is also worth noting that, compared to that of Mo, CoMo, MoNi and Co@MoNi, the much higher rising OER activity of GO-Co@MoNi suggests that the CoNi alloy and graphene templates plays a key role in accelerating the OER performance. Stability is also one of the important indexes to evaluate electrochemical performance. As given in Fig. 5d, only 2 mV was lost at 10 mA cm−2 after 2000 cycles and 98% of initial activity of GO-Co@MoNi could be maintained after i-t test for 5h (Fig. 5e), obviously superior to the commercial RuO2 (90%). Also, the TEM images (Figure S12) show that after long-term electrolysis, the structure of the GO-Co@MoNi remained almost unchanged, indicating the excellent durability of GO-Co@MoNi in alkaline solutions. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalytic surface, giving the linear relationship between ECSA and Cdl for the same sample. The Cdl value calculated by measuring the CV curves at various scan rates from 10 to 50 mV s−1 (Figure S13) is 7.56 mF cm−2 (Fig. 5f), which is significantly higher than that of Mo (0.47 mF cm−2), CoMo (0.36 mF cm−2), MoNi (2.46 mF cm−2), Co@MoNi (1.88 mF cm−2) and RuO2 (4.54 mF cm−2), implying that the GO could increase the ECSA for exposing more inherent catalytic active sites to the electrolyte and also prove the superior performance of GO-Co@MoNi. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results showed the smallest semi-circle for GO-Co@MoNi relative to Co@MoNi and MoNi (Figure S14), demonstrating a great improvement in charge transfer for GO-Co@MoNi. As described above, GO-Co@MoNi exhibited both excellent catalytic performance towards OER and ORR. The voltage gaps (ΔE) of GO-Co@MoNi (0.71 mV) is smaller than most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts (Table S4), which is also very close to the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 with the ΔE value of 0.70 mV (Figure S15), indicating the superior bifunctional catalytic feature of this material. Undoubtedly, in view of the E1/2, η10, and ΔE value, the present SCP-based GO-Co@MoNi can be regard an outstanding oxygen electrocatalysts. 3.3 Zn-air battery tests Inspired by the superior bifunctional catalytic performance of GO-Co@MoNi, we fabricated a primary rechargeable Zn-air battery. A Go-Co@MoNi-loaded carbon cloth and a polished Zn plate were used as the anode and cathode, respectively, and along with an electrolyte consisting of 6 M KOH and 0.2 M zinc acetate to assess electrochemical performance. Fig. 6 a shows that the power density of the GO-Co@MoNi-driven battery is 120.05 mW cm−2, which is 1.27 times higher than that of the Pt/C + RuO2-driven battery. In addition, the specific capacity of the GO-Co@MoNi-driven battery reaches 739.17 mAh g−1, exceeding markedly that of the Pt/C + RuO2-driven battery (669.86 mAh g−1) at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b). These results indicated that GO-CoMoNi could act as a promising and cost-effective alternative to noble-metal catalysts in Zn-air batteries. The stability of GO-Co@MoNi applied in rechargeable Zn-air batteries was also assessed via galvanostatic discharge-charge experiments (Figs. 7 d-e). The initial charge and discharge voltage is 2.02 V and 1.18 V, and the initial round-trip efficiency can reach 58.37 % at 10 mA cm−2. After 5060 min (253 cycles) of charge-discharge processes, the corresponding voltage is about 2.01 V and 1.16 V, and the 253th round-trip efficiency can still maintain 57.64%, proving that the remarkable stability and ORR/OER catalytic activity for this material can realize long time running for Zn-air batteries. 3.4 DFT calculations In order to clearly explain the mechanism behind the ORR experiment, especially the synergistic effect brought by the adjacent Co/Mo/Ni atoms, we explored the whole reacting routes in the present work using the Nørskov model at the level of PBE/DND in DMol3 program [28,29]. As can be found in Figure S16a, 1 is the starting catalyst in the general reacting route catalyzed by the single Mo atom. When 1 is used as the ORR catalyst, the reacting cycle is very general. When we considered this routine ORR route catalyzed by 1,we found out that the highest energy barrier is as high as 1.13 eV from 1 to 2 (Figure S16b). In comparision with the normal catalysts, for commercial examples Pt/C, Pt-based catalysts, other transition monometallic catalysts and so on, 1 is not better qualified. But in the present work, as the standard monometallic catalyst, 1 will be used as the benchmark in the following discussions. When we adopt another catalyst, [CoMo] (6), the catalyzing route will be much more complex. (1) 6 → 7 → 13 → 11 (or 14) → 10 (or 12) → 6, the energy barrier is 0.85 eV from 6 to 7. (2) 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 (or 11) → 10 (or 12) → 6, the energy barrier is 1.04 eV from 7 to 8. After the discussion about [CoMo], it is obviously that the energy barrier in the [CoMo] catalyzing cycle are in the range of 0.85-1.04 eV. Compared to the [Mo] catalyzing cycle of 1.13 eV, the energy barrier in the [CoMo] cycle is obviosly lowered, leading to the relative higher ORR catalyzing activity. It is worthnoting that, in the best route with the lowest energy barrier of 0.85 eV, the 2e −-process from 6 to 11 is catalyzed by Co, Route (1), while the subsequent 2e −-process from 11 → 10→ 6 is catalyzed by Mo, clearly showing the synergistic effect in the [CoMo] cycle. In the experiment, we also adopt the third catalyst (15), in which the catalyzing route is as complex as [CoMo] (6). There are also several possibilities in this catalyzing cycle. Figure S18 shows the six different routes to finish the catalyzing cycle. When we examine the Gibbs free energies of 15-24 (Figure S18a,b), we found that there are three possible routes will be selected in the following manner: (1) 15 → 16 → 17 → 21 (or 18) → 24 (or 19) → 20, the energy barrier is 0.79 eV from 15 to 16. (2) 15 → 16 → 22 → 21 → 24 (or 19) → 20, the energy barrier is 1.56 eV from 22 to 21. (3) 15 → 16 → 22 → 23 → 24 → 20, the energy barrier is 1.19 eV from 22 to 23. Based-on the above discussion, it is obviously that the energy barriers in the catalyzing cycle are in the range between 0.79-1.56 eV. As can be found in Figure S18b, Route (1) with the lowest energy barrier 0.79 eV is the most possible reacting channel, which is obviosly lower than 0.85 eV in the [CoMo] cycle, leading to the even higher ORR catalyzing activity in the cycle. It is worthnoting that, in the best route with the lowest energy barrier of Route (1), the 2e −-process from 15 to 21 is catalyzed by Co, while the subsequent 2e −-process from 21 → 24 → 20 is catalyzed by Mo, clearly also showing the Mo-Ni synergistic effect in the cycle. At the first glance, maybe someone would mistake the cycle as a replica of [CoMo] with the sole difference of catalyzing metals. However, after carefully examination, one can find that the newly-generated water molecule will be absorbed by the Ni atom this cycle. In 20, 23, and 24, the produced H2O would not leave from the reaction system, but attached to the Ni catalyzing site, leading to the formation of [MoNi(·OH2)], [Mo(=O)Ni(·OH2)], and [Mo(-OH)Ni(·OH2)], which further reduced the Gibbs energy barrier from 0.85 eV for the [CoMo] cycle to 0.79 eV for the cycle. At last, we calculated the catalyzing cycle of the ternary catalyst, [Co*Mo*Ni](25). In this cycle, there are twelve routes to finish the ORR reaction in the following manners (Fig. 7a). When we examine the Gibbs free energies of 25-42 (Fig. 7a, b), we find that eight routes will be selected at the same time in the following manner: (1) 25→26→27→28→29→30, the energy barrier is 1.62 eV from 27 to 28. (2) 25→26→27→31→29→30, the energy barrier is 1.37 eV from 27 to 31. (3) 25→26→33→31→29→30, the energy barrier is 1.13 eV from 25 to 26. (4) 25→35→36→37→38→30, the energy barrier is 1.14 eV from 38 to 30. (5) 25→35→36 (or 40)→39 (or 41)→42→30, the energy barrier is 0.47 eV from 42 to 30. (6) 25→26→27→31→32→30, the energy barrier is 1.37 eV from 27 to 31. (7) 25→26→33→31 (or 34)→32→30, the energy barrier is 1.13 eV from 27 to 28. (8) 25→35→36 (or 40)→39→38→30, the energy barrier is 1.14 eV from 38 to 30. As known from the above routes, the energy barriers in the [CoMoNi] catalyzing cycle are in the range 0.47-1.62 eV. Here, we noticed that there is a very smooth channel with the energy barrier of only 0.47 eV along with Route (5), which is of course the best choice for the [CoMoNi] catalyzing cycle. With comparison to the former [CoMo] cycles, the energy barriers in the [CoMoNi] cycle intensely decreases again, leading to the highest ORR catalyzing activity among the four catalysts. It should be pointed out that the so many reaction channels give this ORR reaction many possibilities to fulfill the best catalyzing reactivity of [CoMoNi], among which the most important point is the synergistic effect of Co, Mo, and Ni atoms. In the development process of ORR catalysts, firstly scientists tried to complete the full 4e − reaction from O2 to H2O driven by the sole catalyzing site, for example the noble metal platinum (Pt) [30-32]. Very recently in 2018, we developed a new ethynyl-linked Fe/Co heterometallic phthalocyanine conjugated polymer, and then found out a new FeCoNx-based ORR electrocatalyst, which could drive the ORR process in an optimized manner: (1) the first-half 2e − reaction from O2 to H2O2 driven by Co atom, and (2) the latter-half 2e − reaction from H2O2 to H2O driven by Fe atom [33]. However, the present work provided a brand new pathway to improve the catalytic efficiency of ORR, because the chemical reaction always chooses the most “comfortable” pathway with the lowest potential barrier [34]. In the current work, we in the first time touch the edge of the final ORR catalyzing field: the double-catalyzing process is further divided into the tetra-catalyzing process. As can be found in Route (5) in Fig. 7a, the first, second, third, and forth electron transferring step are driven by the Mo, Co, Mo, and Ni, respectively. In another word, each step selects the most “comfortable” process, leading to the very high ORR catalyzing efficiency. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, by pyrolyzing the Co(II) ion doped bimetallic Mo(IV)-Ni(II) supramolecular coordination polymer and GO, the first SCP-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst GO-Co@MoNi has been successfully developed and structurally detailed characterized. Also, the catalytic functionality of the obtained material has been thoroughly investigated by both various experimental methods and deeply theoretical calculation. Notably, skillful introducing the in situ formed two-dimensional MoN strengthened obviously the intermetallic synergy, thus greatly promoting the electrocatalytic performance of the material. The electrocatalyst exhibited both excellent ORR and OER performance, which are completely comparable to the performance of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. More importantly, detailed DFT calculation revealed unprecedently that the universal 4e − double-catalyzing process could be divided into 4 × 1e− tetra-catalyzing process along the more “comfortable”(some details as the following note) path way for intensely improving the catalytic performance of the material. The present results provide valuable information, new strategy and the very interesting electron transfer catalysis mechanism toward designing and developing low-cost bifunctional catalysts for both elementary studies and realistic use. Other SCP-based high efficient electrocatalysts with bimetallic or even single metal center is current underway in our laboratory.

A.6(18) (2018) 8349-8357. https://doi.org/10.1039/c8ta00516h. [34] Note: Here, the word “comfortable” is a metaphor. For example in Ref [33], when the first-half 2e− reaction (O2 → H2O2) is driven by Co atom, the energy barrier will be lower than by Fe atom. On the contrary, when the latter-half 2e− reaction (H2O2 → H2O) is driven by Co atom, the energy barrier will be higher than by Fe atom. Then, the full ORR reaction will be catalyzed by two atoms, the first-half reaction on Co atom and the latter-half reaction on Fe atom.).",

        "dc:description": "Developing non-precious metal oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance for storage systems and energy conversion. Pyrolyzation of the bimetallic Mo(IV)-Ni(II) supramolecular coordination polymer (SCP) for the first time by simultaneously introducing Co(II) ion with Graphene Oxide (GO) as template leads to a new outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalyst (GO-Co@MoNi) composed structurally by 2D MoN flake formed in situ and CoNi alloy supported on lamellar GO. The unique components, sheet architecture, and intermetallic synergy of the GO-Co@MoNi catalyst (η = 340 mV, E1/2 = 0.855V) endow it comparable electrocatalytic performance towards OER to the commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts (η = 320 mV) and superior performance towards ORR to Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.84 V) electrocatalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the essential role of trimetallic synergy at an unprecedented “comfortable” 4 × 1e− electrons reaction pathway in the excellent ORR in GO-Co@MoNi. The current research opens a skillful design strategy and a rare catalytic mechanism for constructing new oxygen electrocatalysts, and the results show that the SCP-based materials have great potential in the electrochemical field in the future, especially for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.",
