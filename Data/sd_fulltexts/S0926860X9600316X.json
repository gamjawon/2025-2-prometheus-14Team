Characterization of the catalyst Fabiana M.T. Mendes 1, Martin Schmal *'2 NUCAT / PEQ / COPPE, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Caixa Postal 68502, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Received 8 April 1996; revised 5 July 1996; accepted 21 August 1996 Abstract In this first part, we examined the structure and morphology of Rh-Cu/A1203 catalysts with low metal contents, which have been used in cyclohexanol dehydrogenation. The catalysts were prepared by successive wet impregnation after intermediate calcination. They were characterized by TPR, DRS, XPS, XRD and CO FT-IR in the oxide form. The results indicate a high degree of reduction and the presence of copper ions located in octahedral sites, The Rh/A1203 and Rh-Cu/A1203 catalysts display an enrichment of rhodium at the surface, and the presence of copper allows the restructuring of the surface complexes, as shown by DRS and XPS measure- ments. The cluster formation during reduction is attributed to the promoting effect of copper. Infrared results show that the interaction of copper with the support prevents the redispersion or oxidation of rhodium crystallites acting as a \"sacrificed anode.\" Keywords: Bimetallic Rh-Cu catalysts; Rhodium-copper catalysts; Characterization of Rh-Cu in the oxide system; Cyclohexanol dehydrogenation 1.

Dobrovolszky et al. [1], studied this reaction with different catalysts, using metals of group VIIIB and classified them into three groups based on selectivity: (a) Dehydrogenation (Os, Co, Fe, Re, Ru) (b) Aromatization (Pd, Pt, Ni) (c) Intermediate behavior (Ir, Rh) Metals of group (a) directed the reaction toward the cyclohexanone forma- tion, with less production of cyclohexene. The presence of oxygen in cyclohex- anol increases the reactivity when compared to the reactions involving only hydrocarbons. Rhodium and iridium increased the reactivity for dehydrogena- tion. Nikiforova and Zhavnerko [2] investigated this reaction with copper supported catalysts and also observed good dehydrogenation. Bimetallic catalysts have been used for dehydrogenation-hydrogenation reac- tions [3-6]. The important feature is that the second metal acts as diluent of the active metal or may also promote ligand effect, affecting the selectivity. The structure and morphology were studied, but there are some controversial points concerning the bimetallic or alloy formation [6-10]. In this study, we have examined Rh-Cu/A1203 catalysts focusing primarily on some aspects of structure and morphology, followed by a second part with the catalyst performance in the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation as well as charac- terization of the active sites. 2. Experimental 2.1. The catalysts A y-A1203 support from Harshaw 3996-R was used (200 m2/g). The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation technique using RhCl3 3H20 and Cu(NO3)2.3HeO as precursor salts. The mono metallic catalysts contain 0.5 and 1.0% of rhodium and 0.5% of copper metal loading. F.M.T. Mendes, M.

After impregnation, they were dried for 24 h and calcined in flowing air (80 ml/min), with a heating rate of 10 K/min. The final tempera- tures of calcination were 680 K and 723 K for rhodium and copper, respectively. The bimetallic catalysts were calcined at 680 K in the first step and 723 K in the second, each one for 2 h. Table 1 summarizes the catalysts, metal contents and preparation conditions. 2.2. Characterization Metal content and surface were determined through atomic absorption (Perkin Elmer 1100B) and BET (Micromeritics Asap2000) measurements. Results are listed in Table 1. 2.2.1. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) TPR analysis and equipment are described elsewhere [11]. Before reduction, the catalyst was treated with flowing Ar at 393 K for 30 min. Then, a flowing mixture (50 ml/min) of 1.7% H2/Ar was introduced, raising the temperature at 10 K/min from room temperature up to 620 K or 773 K and kept there for 30 rain. 2.2.2. UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) The catalysts were analyzed in a Cary 5 (Varian) DRS equipment in the oxide form after drying, by varying the wavelength from 180 nm to 1500 nm. The support was used as reference. 2.2.3. X-ray photoeletronic spectroscopy (XPS) Samples in the oxide phase were analyzed in an equipment (Perkin Elmer Physical Electronics 1257 (MgKt~) at a vacuum of 10-8 Torr. The reference peak was A1 2p (74 eV). 396 F.M.T. Mende s, M. Schmal / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 393-408 2.2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) The catalysts were examined in an XRD equipment using a Co tube 35 KV-30 mA and a pace of 0.05 2.2.5. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) FT-IR measurements were performed in a 2000 Perkin-Elmer equipment. The catalyst was pressed in the form of pastille and placed in a specific cell adapted to perform CO adsorption under different pretreatment conditions. After evacua- tion at 2. 10-2 Torr, CO was admitted at room temperature, followed by evacuation at 393 K or 773 K and again CO was adsorbed at room temperature. Then, the catalyst was reduced with pure hydrogen, raising the temperature up to 623 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min, kept at that temperature for 20 h and evacuated. Finally, CO was adsorbed after cooling to room temperature, fol- lowed by evacuation. IR measurements were obtained at each intermediate step. 3. Results 3.1. TPR TPR results of the mono and bimetallic catalysts are displayed in Fig. 2 and the corresponding H2 consumption values are listed in Table 2. The rhodium profiles (F1 and F3) are very similar, presenting a broad shape profile, starting at 373 K with a maximum around 473 K. Similar behavior was observed for the copper catalyst, but the peak was shifted toward higher temperatures (523-623 K). All bimetallic catalysts exhibit similar profiles. However, the maximum peaks are shifted toward lower temperatures with increasing concentration of the metals. The profiles indicate some interaction between Rh and Cu, as well as a promoting effect of metallic rhodium on the reduction of copper oxide. The higher the concentrations of rhodium, the sharper are the peaks toward isolated metal oxides. Table 2 presents the degree of reduction, assuming transformation of Cu2to Cuand Rh+3 to Rh The degrees of reduction of the bimetallic catalysts are higher compared to the mono metallic. In particular, the copper catalyst is more difficult to reduce. The catalysts with lower concentration of rhodium exhibit excess of hydrogen consumption. 3.2. UV-DRS The UV-DRS spectra are shown in Fig. 3. Copper displays three bands: one sharp band at 263 nm with a shoulder at 304 nm and a broad band around 727 nm. The rhodium oxide catalysts also display three bands at 451, 346 and 283 nm, the last one being most intense. The bimetallic Rh-Cu catalysts exhibit one F.M.T. Mendes, M.

In addition, the DRS spectra of the precursor RhC13 3H20 with and without calcination are presented in Fig. 4. The precursor calcined at 723 K exhibits a well defined triplet at 328, 412 and 517 nm. However, after calcination at 873 K only a large broad band appears around 438 nm with a small shoulder at 329 nm. The characteristic bands of the uncalcined precursor are located at 328 nm and 438 nm. Finally, the DRS spectra of Cu/A1203 were reduced at 773 K and passivated with N20 for 1 h are shown in Fig. 5.

The support indicates incomplete crystallinity and the metal oxide was not detected, in agreement with previous work [12-14]. 3.4. XPS The XPS results of the mono and bimetallic catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7, showing the corresponding lineshapes of Cu2p and Rh3d. The satellite peak which corresponds to Cu2+ species was not detected, but only one band Cu2p3/2 at 932.8 eV was observed. However, the bimetallic Rh-Cu catalysts exhibit a small satellite peak, as shown in Fig. 6b. The Cu2p3/2 band is also increased by 0.4 eV. Table 3 lists the XPS and Auger binding energies. Copper shows one band around 914 eV. The Cu2P3/2 binding energy decreases by 0.4-0.6 eV. The binding energy of Rh3d3/2 is 308.4 eV and increases by 0.76 eV in the presence of copper. The energy difference of rhodium A(3d3/2-3ds/2) increases with the addition of copper in the bimetallic catalysts.

The Cu/A1 ratios from XPS and chemical analysis are coincident on the copper supported catalyst, which indicate that the copper species are homogeneously distributed in A1203. On the other side, the Rh/AI203 and Rh-Cu/A1203 catalysts exhibit enrichment of rhodium at the surface. 3.5. IR spectroscopy IR spectra of the different catalysts are presented in Fig. 8. The CO adsorption on Cu/Al203 is completely reversible, while on Rh/AI203 two main irreversible bands were observed at 2098 cm-~ and 2028 cm-1. However, the addition of copper to Rh/AI203 modified the IR spectra, as shown in the 1Rh-0.6Cu catalyst, displaying two other bands at 2060 and 2134 cm-'. The CO adsorption spectra of 0.5% Cu/A1203 after different pretreatment are displayed in Fig. 9. Two bands at 2032 and 2100 cm-1 were observed after evacuation at room temperature. For higher temperatures the 2100 cm-1 band decreases while the 2032 cm-J increases. For higher temperatures the first band disappears and two other new bands at 2144 and 2123 cm-' are formed. 4. Discussion 4.1. The single Cu /Al20~ catalyst The reduction degree of CuO on the Cu/A1203 catalyst was only 57% and, therefore, it is very difficult to reduce it due to the strong interaction with the F.M.T.

Tikhov et al. [15] and Strohmeier et al. [12] observed that Cu stabilizes as Cut+ and the complete reduction of Cu2to Cuis more difficult for low content of copper on supported catalyst. The TPR profiles also exhibit a reduction of copper oxide at temperatures where aluminate species are formed as superficial spinels. The XPS results show Cu2+ in the satellite peak of Cu2p3/2 at higher energy levels due to the charge transfer (CT) (O2p ~ Cu3d). This CT is not observed on Cu1or Cuhaving complete 3d orbital [16]. Therefore, from Auger and XPS binding energies, it was possible to identify copper species in the oxidation state + 1. The Auger binding energies are listed in Table 5. The XPS Cu2p3/2 lineshapes exhibit similar BE values for Cu20 and Cuwhich are distinct in the Auger lineshapes. The binding energy of CuzO is 914 eV, in good agreement with Tikhov et al. [15], but different from Sexton et al. [17]. They found a binding energy of 912.7 eV. From the correlation between the Auger parameter and the binding energies for Cu2P3/2, according to Tikhov et al. [15], the BE value of 914 eV corresponds to the copper species in the oxidation state + 1. Moreover, the Cu/AI intensity increases with the increase in the radiation energy, which indicates that copper species diffuse in the alumina structure. Unlike higher Cu loading, lower contents favor the diffusion of copper in the alumina sublayer surface and hence favors the spinel formation. The BE of the surface spinel is different from the bulk aluminate, as shown in Table 5. These results suggest that initially neither Cu20 and CuO are on the surface, but isolated Cu2ions in weakly associated form, in agreement with Tikhov et al. [15]. Another evidence of this statement is the blue light color after calcination, which during XPS analysis is partially reduced to a yellow color. The following question is what structure Cu2 species have over the alumina support. Friedman and Freedman [18] and Strohmeier et al. [12] used the UV-DRS technique and observed bands between 600 and 900 nm, which correspond to the octahedral coordination, while those bands between 1300 and 1600 nm to the tetrahedral coordination. Fig. 3 shows that Cu/A1203 catalyst 404 F.M.T. Mendes, M, Schmal /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)393-408 exhibits a broad band with a maximum peak at 727 nm, but no absorption bands above 1300 nm, which suggests the presence of copper species in the octahedral coordination. Moreover, if segregation of CuO occurs, it should appear in the asymmetric band at higher energy levels (lower wave numbers) as observed by Jacono et al. [19]. Fig. 3A did not show any asymmetric shape around 700 nm, thus, confirming the absence of segregated CuO, also visualized in the blue light color. The CT bands give us an idea of the environment in the neighborhood of Cu2ions. According to the literature, the band at 273 nm indicates the transition of 02-~ Cu2 where the Cu ions occupy isolated sites over the support, whereas the band at 357 nm indicates the presence of [Cu-O-Cu]n clusters different from the bulk CuO. These bands appeared here at 263 nm and 304 nm. These results are in good agreement with XPS data and suggest that Cu2+ ions diffuse onto the sublayer forming surface spinels. IR results from CO adsorption on Cu/A1203 show that CO is weakly adsorbed on metallic sites, in agreement with the literature [8,9]. However, after vacuum at room temperature it seems that CO is adsorbed on CuI species, as also observed by Tikhov et al. [15], who attributed this to the adsorption on clusters of different kinds: Cul+-O-Cu2+-O-Cul+ (I) and Cu+l /\\ 0 Gu (II) The bands 2144 and 2126 cm- ~ are assigned to the redistribution of Cu sites which are formed after pretreatment. These bi- and tri-dimensional Cu1 + sites were also observed in the XPS spectra, confirming that under vacuum conditions the Cu2+ species are reduced to Cu1+ The 2032 cm-1 band increases with higher temperatures. However, this is difficult to explain due to the interference of other bands. CO adsorption has been suggested to occur on metallic copper below 2100 cm-1 [20]. Although the 2032 cm-~ band can also be related to the adsorption on metallic copper, it seems that the adsorption occurs preferentially on surface carbonates, according to Jong et al. [21 ]. 4.2. The Rh /A1203 and Rh-Cu /A1203 The TPR profiles of Rh/A1203 display one peak at 430 K or 490 K for 1Rh/A1203 and 0.5Rh/A1203 catalysts, respectively. The first peak is in agreement with Refs. [22,23,29] and the second is shifted toward higher F.M.T. Mendes, M. Schmal / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)393-408 405 temperature, which is attributed to the reduction of dispersed rhodium and to a stronger interaction with the support. The Rh-Cu/AI203 profiles are similar to the analogous rhodium profiles, but the peaks assigned to rhodium are better distinguished. Copper is easily reduced and favors the reduction of isolated rhodium which then causes the formation of the bimetallic. The degree of reduction is increased compared to Cu/A1203 attaining 90%, in particular the 1Rh-0.6Cu/AI203 catalyst. The 0.5Rh-0.3Cu/A1203 catalyst, having lower Rh/Cu ratio (0.78), displays a profile which indicates a better distribution of phases and hence a better metal dispersion. As for the mono metallic Rh/AI203 catalyst this bimetallic system exhibited excess of hydrogen consumption, which is attributed to the spillover effect. XPS results of Rh/AI203 are presented in Table 3 and indicate that the binding energy of Rh3d5/2 is 308.4 eV. In agreement with Sanyal et al. [24], these species are in the oxidation state + 3. Moreover, the presence of chlorine confirm that it was not completely removed after the calcination step. The atomic ratios of Rh/A1 indicate an enrichment of rhodium at the surface which, however, decreases with higher concentration of rhodium and thus favoring the agglomeration of rhodium particles. On the other hand, the satellite peak associated with copper disappears on the bimetallic catalysts. In contrast to the Cu/AI203 catalyst, here the Cu2+ species become prominent and the reduction due to X-ray incidence under vacuum conditions is less pronounced. However, the bandshift of Cu2P3/2, together with an increase of 1 eV in the binding energy of Rh3d5/2, suggests an interaction of copper with rhodium. Nefedof et al. [32] found a binding energy of 309 eV, which was attributed to a mixed CuRh204 system. Here we found 309.4 eV for the 1Rh-0.6Cu/AI203 catalyst which may indicate some interaction during the calcination step. The UV-DRS spectra exhibit band triplets at 266, 332, 434 nm for 0.5Rh/A1203 and 283, 346 and 451 nm for the 1Rh/A1203 catalysts. The 346 and 451 nm bands indicate bonding between chlorine and oxygen. However, the bands of the 0.5Rah/Al203 catalyst not only indicate less chlorine, but also the presence of [Rh(Ox)3]3-complexes, as shown in Ref. [25]. The CT bands at 266 and 286 nm correspond to the oxygen-metal transition ions. These bands are assigned to the transition of O2--Rh3+ ligand, much like low spin in analogy to the d6 complexes. The calcined precursor at 723 K (Fig. 4B) also displays triplets at 328, 412 and 517 nm. The last indicates the presence of chlorine while the first an oxygen ligand. By increasing the temperature of calcination (873 K), these bands disappear giving place to a large broad band with a maximum around 438 nm, and a shoulder at 329 nm, which is attributed to the formation of bulk oxide. The latter has only oxygen ligands at 398.4 nm and 333.3 nm. Notwithstanding is that the bimetallic systems indicate superposition of bands of the corresponding mono metallic catalysts. The bands at 719 nm of 0.3Rh- 406 F.M.T. Mendes, M. Schmal / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 393-408 0.2Cu/A1203, 706 nm of 0.5Rh-0.3Cu/AI203 and 713 nm of 1Rh- 0.6Cu/A1203, are assigned to copper ions located in the octahedral sites, while the charge transfer bands 282, 278 and 280 nm correspond to the superposition bands between 283 and 263 nm and; finally, the 428 nm band corresponds to the superposition of bands 434, 332 and 304 nm of rhodium. The intensity of the 283 nm band increased 10-fold, inducing structure changes in the oxide form, in accordance with XPS results, which occurred during the calcination step. The IR results on Rh/AI203 are in agreement with the literature and their conclusions indicate that there are three kind of bands: O CO CO 0 I I \\/ Rh Rh Rh-.-.Rh I II III The 2095 cm-; band is assigned to the asymmetric band type I, whereas the 2060 and 1800 cm-] bands to the adsorption of type II and type III, respec- tively. The type I bond is normally observed on well dispersed Rh particles, according to Rice and Worley [26] and Solymosi and Pasztor [27]. Thus, the 2099 and 2033 cm-] bands can be assigned to the carbonyl geminate adsorption of CO, confirming the high dispersion of Rh particles on the Rh/AI203 catalysts and linear adsorption bands, lnfrared studies on bimetallic Rh- Cu/AI203 catalysts were reported in Refs. [27,28]. Dumas et al. [8] and Barbier et al. [9] observed changes in the geminate and linear adsorption bands and the appearance of new bands at 2160 and 2175 cm-I, which they attributed to the adsorption of CO on copper ion species. The bimetallic Rh-Cu/AI203 catalysts displayed similar behavior. We observed one band at 2134 cm-1 which is assigned to Cu+]. According to Yates et al. [13] and Rice and Worley [26], the adsorption band which corresponds to Rh(CO)2 occurs on highly dispersed Rh catalysts and that CO chemisorbed on Rh clusters may break the Rh-Rh bond followed by an oxidation of isolated Rh atoms. According to Basu et al. [10], Scheme 1 is proposed. RhO O(g)~ RhO0 , CO Fib 0__ CO ~ [Ah~CO ] ~ O-.-H O~--FIh -- CO [Rh~COl\"+ _L. ~ ] + 1/2 H2 [g] +1 CO~P,h +1 CO 0'/ I:lh~ CO l 0 I CO[gl >' I Scheme I. F.M.T. Mendes, M. Schmal / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 393-408 407 Hence, one can assume that copper interferes by interacting with the support and affects the adsorption on Rh atoms, avoiding redispersion or oxidation of Rh crystallites. Therefore, it acts as a \"sacrificed anode\" preventing the oxidation of Rh atoms. Thus, the formation of Rh1+ induced by the CO adsorption oxidizes the copper atoms. 5. Conclusions The Cu/A1203 catalyst in the oxide form shows that copper species diffuse onto alumina surface favoring the formation of surface spinels which have a different structure of the bulk aluminate. The Cu2+ species are located on the octahedral sites of alumina. The Rh/A1203 and Rh-Cu/A1203 catalysts display an enrichment of rhodium at the surface and the presence of copper allows the restructuring of the surface complexes. The cluster formation during reduction is attributed to the promoting effect of copper. Copper interact with the support, affecting the adsorption of Rh atoms and preventing the redispersion or oxidation of Rh crystallites. Therefore, it acts as a \"sacrificed anode\" avoiding the oxidation of Rh atoms. Thus, the formation of RhI + induced by the CO adsorption promotes the oxidation of copper atoms. References [1] M.
