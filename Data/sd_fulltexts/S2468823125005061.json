The limited catalytic stability of catalysts has long posed a challenge for the application of transfer hydrogenation technology, which can be performed under mild conditions. Based on the Pd/TiO2 catalyst, the effect of Zn addition on the catalytic stability in low temperature transfer hydrogenation using fomic acid (HCOOH) has been investigated. The results indicate the Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits rapid deactivation, with nearly complete loss of catalytic activity in five rounds of the reaction. In contrast, the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst shows almost no signs of deactivation throughout all reaction cycles. Various characterizations have ruled out the factors including Pd leaching, morphological and valence changes in Pd, and support collapse that can lead to deactivation. Spectroscopy data confirms that the primary reason for rapid deactivation of Pd/TiO2 is the accumulation of formate on the catalyst surface, which hinders the contact between active sites and reactants. Conversely, the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst does not experience similar issues as observed with Pd/TiO2. On the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst, HCOOH undergoes complete decomposition into CO2 and active hydrogens through a different reaction pathway (HCOOH→COOH+H→CO2+2H). The present work demonstrates that altering the reaction pathway is an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic stablity of the catalyst in low temperature transfer hydrogenation.

The technique of transfer hydrogenation utilizing liquid hydrogen donors allows for the progression of the hydrogenation reaction under normal or relatively low pressure conditions [2,3]. Among the various liquid hydrogen donors, formic acid (HCOOH) stands out for its high hydrogen content, low toxicity, and widespread availability. More importantly, HCOOH can efficiently release active hydrogens for hydrogenation reactions under catalytic conditions. The advantages of HCOOH in transfer hydrogenation have attracted considerable attention from a diverse range of stakeholders [4–6]. However, while catalysts exhibit excellent performance during initial transfer hydrogenation reactions, their catalytic efficiency tends to diminish considerably upon recycling or extended operation [3,7]. Consequently, the advancement of stable catalysts for the hydrogen transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH is critically important for the practical application of this technology. In general, during the reaction process, phenomena such as metal loss from the catalyst, migration, fusion and growth of nanoclusters, as well as alterations in chemical valences can contribute to a reduction in the active sites available for catalysis, ultimately resulting in a decline in catalytic activity [8–11]. Additionally, the structural collapse of the catalyst support during the reaction process can also lead to the complete failure of the catalyst [12]. These phenomena are indicative of the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Moreover, strong adsorption or accumulation of reaction species on the catalyst impedes the interaction between its active sites and reactants, resulting in a swift deterioration in catalytic performance [13]. This type of deactivation is considered to be reversible. Due to the relatively mild reaction conditions of thelow temperature transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH, it is improbable that above issues such as migration and fusion of nanoclusters will manifest in its catalyst. However, other potential catalyst deactivation mechanisms may emerge within this reaction system and require further clarification [11–14]. Numerous previous efforts have been dedicated to meidating the catalytic stablity of catalysts for transfer hydrogenation. The selection of appropriate supports or the modification of surface properties of supports has been reported to enhance the interaction strength between metals and supports, thereby mitigating metal loss [15]. Similarly, constructing specialized structures of support to confine or encapsulate metal within the pores has proven effective in preventing metal loss as well as inhibiting the growth of metal nanoparticle [10,16,17]. Furthermore, introducing promoters or doping supports can modulate the electronic structure of metals, resulting in regulating and stabilizing their chemical valences [18–21]. These approaches may also assist in reducing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, facilitating their desorption and enhancing the catalytic stability. Additionally, regarding issues related to strong adsorption of reactants, introducing certain substances into reactions or optimizing reaction conditions to promote desorption and removal of these species represents a viable solution [22]. Despite considerable advancements, there remains an ongoing encouragement across various fields for the development of novel strategies aimed at enhancing the catalytic stability of transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. In transfer hydrogenation reactions, palladium is frequently utilized as the primary catalyst. Our previous research has demonstrated that Pd supported on titanium dioxide (Pd/TiO2) can exhibit superior catalytic performance in low temperature transfer hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) using HCOOH compared to traditional carbon-supported Pd catalyst. Further findings revealed that the incorporation of Zn as a promoter into the Pd/TiO2 catalyst could facilitate an alternative reaction pathway for the complete decomposition of HCOOH and highly efficient transfer hydrogenation [23]. Given the strong representativeness of this reaction, the transfer hydrogenation of p-NP using HCOOH was employed as a model reaction in the present work to evaluate the catalytic stability of Zn-Pd/TiO2 in comparsion with Pd/TiO2. Based on the aforementioned deactivation mechanisms, we systemically analyzed the differences in catalytic stability between Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts through various characterization techniques. The insights gained from this research are anticipated to contribute significantly to the advancement of stability regulation technologies for low temperature transfer hydrogenation catalysts using HCOOH. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials and synthesis Palladium chloride (PdCl2, ≥ 99.5 %), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, ≥ 99.95 %) and ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, ≥ 65 %,) were provided by Shanghai Agent Co., Ltd. Formic acid (HCOOH, ≥ 88 %, Nanjing Agent Co., Ltd), hydrochloric acid (HCl, ≥ 37 wt. %, Nanjing Agent Co, Ltd) were used as received. Commercial titanium dioxide (TiO2, ≥ 99.5 %) was acquired from Degussa Co, Ltd. P-nitrophenol (p-NP, ≥ 99.5 %) were supplied by Macklin Inc. All chemicals were used without any further purification. The Pd/TiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pd) was prepared by wet impregnation according to our previous work [23]. Firstly, 0.17 mmol of HCl aqueous solution was combined with 0.09 mmol of PdCl2, and the mixed solution was dropwise added to 1 g of dried TiO2 powders. Subsequently, the impregnated mixtures were placed statically overnight and dried at 100 °C for 12 h, followed by calcination at 400 °C for 2 h. Finally, Pd/TiO2 catalyst was obtained by reducing the calcined powders in 10 % H2/N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst with Zn/Pd molar ratio of 1 was also prepared by the same method. A specific quantity of ZnCl2 was added into the mixture of PdCl2 and HCl aqueous solution, while all subsequent operations were conducted in accordance with those used for the preparation of Pd/TiO2. 2.2 Characterization The crystal structural information of various samples was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 10°·min‒1 and a step size of 0.02°. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption (at ‒196 °C) was performed by using the ASAP2020 system (Micromeritics, USA). Surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V P) was obtained by BET method and nitrogen adsorption at a relative pressure of 0.99, respectively. Pore size distributions were found from adsorption isotherms by BJH method. Scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7600F) at 5.0 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100) at 200 kV were used to examine the samples, nanoscale morphology. The nanoscale structure of the catalyst was analyzed by using the high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) technique on a FEI Themis Z microscope with the electron beam energy of 200 kV. The HAADF-STEM image of 1024 × 1024 pixels was obtained through Thermo Scientific Velox software with the residence time of 10 μs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) furnished with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray beam (1486.6 eV) was used to analyze the chemical state of Pd, O and Ti elements on the catalyst surface. All binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak (284.6 eV) arising from the adventitious hydrocarbons. The Pd loading proportion of the fresh and used catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 5110, USA). Before the test, the sample was dissolved through digestion with 10 mL HNO3 in a graphite heating plate at 100 °C for 30 min, and then microwave treatment at 180 °C for 10 min. The resulting residue was then dissolved with 1 M HNO3 for ICP-OES analysis. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) was carried out on a Nicolet-6700 spectroscope apparatus (Thermo Electron) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory and a MCT detector. In the present work, the DRIFTS experiments are categorized into HCOOH-DRIFTS and CO-DRIFTS based on different adsorbed substances. The dehydrogenation pathway of HCOOH was studied by HCOOH-DRIFTS on various catalysts. The catalysts were firstly placed in a ceramic crucible of the chamber and in situ pretreated with pure H2 gas (30 mL min‒1) from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C·min‒1. After being cooled down to room temperature, the chamber was purged with pure He (30 mL min‒1) for 10 min to remove the H2. Subsequently, the mixed gas of HCOOH (∼34 ppm) and H2O/He was introduced into the chamber at 25 °C for 30 min. Finally, the pure He passed through the chamber to study the consumption and dehydrogenation of different intermediate. For the HCOOH-DRIFTS experiments of the used catalyst, the pretreatment was conducted by purging with pure He at 30 mL min‒1 and maintaining at 25 °C for 30 min. The rest of their experimental operations were consistent with those of the pristine catalysts. Moreover, the dispersion state of Pd particles was analyzed by CO-DRIFTS, whose pretreatment was identical to that of HCOOH-DRIFTS as mentioned above. After cooling down to room temperature and purging with pure He flow for 10 min, the chamber was introduced with pure CO gas for 30 min. Then, the excessive and weakly absorbed CO was purged by pure He flow and the spectrum was sampled with 32 times. 2.3 Evaluation of catalytic stability The reaction of transfer hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol using HCOOH was conducted at 25 °C under atmospheric pressure. The mixture containing 25 mmol of formic acid, 0.95 mmol of p-nitrophenol and 40 mL of deionized water were added in a jacketed beaker and then was vigorously stirred under a N2 atmosphere. After the addition of the catalyst, the reaction was initiated and sample was taken every 2 min. The concentration of p-nitrophenol in the product was determined by monitoring its absorbance at 317 nm using a UV-2802 spectrophotometer (Unico (Shanghai) Instrument Co., LTD), which was determined according to the standard calibration equation between the concentration of the reaction solution and the absorbance. The reaction rate constant (k) of the catalyst was obtained by linear fitting ln(ct/c0) with the reaction time. The equation was shown as follows: l n c t c 0 = m k t Where, c t represents the concentration of p-NP at a specific reaction time (t), and c 0 represents the initial concentration of p-NP. Upon completion of the reaction, the solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to collect the catalyst powder, and then dried at room temperature. In the next run of the reaction, the collected catalyst was reintroduced into a fresh reaction solution, and all operational procedures were consistent with those described above. The recycling experiment for the catalyst was conducted over five cycles. Changes in the k value of various catalysts were monitored to assess catalytic stability. Moreover, for the catalyst regeneration experiments, treatments such as washing with ammonia aqueous solution or rinsing with water were applied to the catalyst following each catalytic performance evaluation. 3 Result and discussion The reaction rate constant (k) values for transfer hydrogenation of p-NP using HCOOH over Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 across different cycles of reactions are presented in Fig. 1 . It is evident that the k value for pristine Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst is 0.244 L·(min·gcat)‒1, which is significantly higher than that of Pd/TiO2 (0.0464 L·(min·gcat)‒1), as demonstrated previously [23]. At the second cycle, a reduction of 15 % in the k value for Pd/TiO2 compared to its pristine state is observed, while at the fifth cycle, this value remains below 10 %, indicating nearly complete deactivation of Pd/TiO2. In contrast, the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits markedly superior catalytic stability during transfer hydrogenation with HCOOH, showing a decrease in k value of <10 % after five cycles. This minimal decline in k value for Zn-Pd/TiO2 may be attributed to the unavoidable loss of catalyst throughout the recycling process. Notably, at the fifth cycling reaction, the k value for Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst remains at 0.236 L·(min·gcat)‒1 which is 36.8 folds that of Pd/TiO2 counterpart. Therefore, it can be determined that Zn-Pd/TiO2 offers the advantages of both high activity and excellent stability in catalytic transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH when compared to Pd/TiO2. In the subsequent content, the structural analysis of the catalysts was conducted to elucidate the reasons behind the exceptional catalytic stability exhibited by the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst during transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. The pore structure of the pristine and used catalysts was analyzed firstly. All N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the pristine and used catalysts (Fig. S1) exhibit the type IV characteristics, with significant overlap between them, indicating that there is an insignificant change in pore structure of both catalysts after five cycles of reaction [24,25]. Table 1 presents the surface area (S BET) and pore volume (V p) of various catalysts. The pristine Pd/TiO2 and Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalysts exhibit S BET values of approximately 46.5 m2·g‒1 and V p values ranging from 0.36 to 0.38 cm3·g‒1, respectively. After five cycles of reaction, these parameters show minimal variation for both catalysts, suggesting that their pore structures remain stable post-reaction. Thus, it can be concluded that the difference in catalytic stability during transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH between these two catalysts is not attributable to variations in their pore structures. Fig. 2 (a) displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the used catalysts in comparison to their pristine counterparts. All patterns reveal five distinct signal diffraction peaks at 25.4°, 37.8°, 49.7°, 53.9°, and 55.1° ascribed to the anatase phase of TiO2 [26], along with three prominent signal diffraction peaks at 27.5°, 36.1°, and 41.2° attributed to the rutile phase of TiO2 [27,28]. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 2(b), no diffraction peaks associated with Pd species (2θ = 41.2°, 44.1°) are detected in the XRD patterns of both used Pd/TiO2 and Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalysts, preliminary judging an excellent dispersion state of Pd species after the reaction. A similar conclusion can be drawn regarding the good dispersion of Zn species within the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. The micro- and nano-structural characteristics of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts, both before and after the reaction, were further examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. S2-S3, the micro-morphologies of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts following five cycles of reaction do not exhibit any significant differences compared to their pristine counterparts. TEM images reveal that the nano-morphologies of the supports in used Zn-Pd/TiO2 (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S2) and Pd/TiO2 (Fig. S3) catalysts remain unchanged when compared to those of their pristine forms, which aligns with results from XRD and BET analyses. The metal nanoparticles within both pristine Pd/TiO2 and Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalysts are uniformly dispersed across the surface of TiO2, consistent with our previous findings [23]. It is noteworthy that a substantial number of metal nanoparticles are also observed in the TEM images of both used catalysts. Simultaneously, the HAADF-STEM-mapping image of the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 (Fig. S4) shows that Zn elements are mainly distributed on the Pd nanoparticles, suggesting that Zn and Pd can still maintain the alloy structure. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis presented in Table 1 further indicates that the palladium content in both Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts remains basically unchanged before and after reaction conditions are applied. Consequently, it can be determined from insignificant metal loss that the superior catalytic stability exhibited by Zn-Pd/TiO2 relative to Pd/TiO2 is not attributable to metal leaching during these reactions. The size distribution of metal nanoparticles in two catalysts was analyzed and statistically evaluated to differentiate the changes occurring in each reaction cycle (Fig. 3(e)). Results indicate that the metal particle size of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst remains essentially constant at approximately 2.8 nm as the reaction cycle increase, whereas the particle size of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits a slight increase. However, this change is not statistically significant. It can be concluded that there is no agglomeration of metal nanoparticles during the reaction process of transfer hydrogenation for both the Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts. In conjunction with the statistical analysis of particle sizes, the turnover frequency (TOF) values for both the fresh state and after five reaction cycles of two catalysts were further calculated. The results reveal that after five reactions, the TOF value for the Pd/TiO2 catalyst decreases to 1.5 h‒1, which is significantly lower than its initial value (54 h‒1), suggesting considerable alterations in catalytic active sites post-reaction. In contrast, the TOF values of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits remarkable consistency before (133 h‒1) and after (130 h‒1) the reaction. This observation indicates that the active site structure of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst remains stable throughout the course of the reaction. The atomic-level structure of metal nanoparticles was analyzed by CO adsorbed in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (CO-DRIFTS) to investigate the changes in active sites of various catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the bands corresponding to the used Pd/TiO2 catalyst at 2050‒2150 cm‒1 and 1850‒1950 cm‒1, which are attributed to linear adsorption and tri-coordination adsorption of CO onto Pd [29], exhibit unchanged intensities compared to those of the pristine catalyst. However, the intensity of the band within the range from 1950 to 2000 cm‒1, associated with bridge adsorption of CO onto Pd [30], shows a reduction in the spectrum for the used Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This may be attributed to a decrease in the number of adsorption sites on the platform brought by the altered Pd particle size, or the presence of adsorbed species on the surface of Pd nanoparticles [31]. In contrast, for the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst, bands in these three regions remain largely consistent before and after reaction. The appearance of bridge and tri-coordination adsorptions of CO indicates the presence of multi-atomic Pd ensemble in these Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst [23]. However, the band assigned to linear adsorption of CO on single-atom Pd (2101 cm‒1) disappears entirely in the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Our previous study had demonstrated that the active site for transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH was attributed to the multi-atomic Pd ensemble rather than the single-atom Pd [23]. Therefore, it can be confirmed that after multiple cycling reactions, the structure of active sites in the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst is almost the same as that of the pristine counterpart. The chemical valent state of Pd is one of the crucial factors for influencing the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Hence, XPS was further employed to analyze the valent difference between the pristine and used catalysts. As depicted in Fig. S5, all the XPS Pd 3d spectra can be divided into two 3d 5/2–3d 3/2 doublets peaks at the binding energies of 334.5–339.8 eV and 336.1–341.4 eV, corresponding to Pd0 and Pd2+, respectively [32]. The area of Pd 3d 5/2 bands is used to calculate the contents of Pd0 and Pd2+ and the corresponding results are presented in Table 1. The Pd° content of the pristine Pd/TiO2 catalyst is 93.1 %, and then decreases slightly after the reaction. This tiny difference in chemical valence of Pd can’t account for the nearly complete deactivation of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst in the fifth reaction round. In contrast, the Pd° content of the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst instead increases slightly compared with that of the pristine one. This difference within the error range suggests the stable chemical valence of Pd in the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst, indicating that the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst had good catalytic stability from the valent analysis. Based on the above structural analysis, it can be determined that after multiple rounds of transfer hydrogenation reactions involving HCOOH, there are no significant changes in the pore structure of support, morphology and valence of metals, active site configuration of the two catalysts. Thus, the influence of these structural factors in the deactivation of Pd-based catalysts can be excluded. Furthermore, it can also be ruled out that the generation of hydrogen gas from HCOOH dehydrognation is responsible for the distinct catalytic stability of the catalysts, since no hydrogen gas bubble can be generated from HCOOH under the current reaction conditions [23,33]. Subsequently, it is further analyzed whether the adsorption and accumluation of reaction species contribute to catalyst deactivation. It is widely recognized that a variety of stable intermediate species are formed during the decomposition of HCOOH on the catalyst surface [3,6,34]. Therefore, the decomposition process of HCOOH on various catalysts is studied utilizing HCOOH adsorbed in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformed spectroscopy (HCOOH-DRIFTS) in the following content. The HCOOH-DRIFTS experiment was carried out through two stages, i.e. the initial purge with a mixture of HCOOH+H2O/He for 10 min, followed by a subsequent purge with pure He for 20 min. The detailed HCOOH-DRIFT spectra of various catalysts are displayed in Fig. S6∼Fig. S9 of the Supporting Information. Fig. 5 illustrates the DRIFT spectra at the initial stage and final state for the pristine and used catalysts. Our previous studies have demonstrated that HCOOH decomposes on the Pd/TiO2 catalyst via the classical reaction pathway, specifically HCOOH→HCOO+ H→CO2+2H [23]. This can be demonstrated by the appearance of characteristic peaks corresponding to carboxyl groups (1710‒1740 cm‒1) from adsorbed HCOOH and formate species (1360–1400 cm‒1, 1540‒1580 cm‒1) in the DRIFT spectrum of Pd/TiO2 at the initial stage (Fig. 5(a)) [35]. Under the current reaction conditions, HCOOH is only decomposed on Pd/TiO2 into formate species and active hydrogen, whereas further decomposition of formate is hindered, as evidenced by the prominent formate signal observed in the final stage of the DRIFT spectrum. In contrast, the HCOOH decomposition on Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst has been demonstrated previously to conduct via a distinct reaction pathway, specifically HCOOH→COOH+H→CO2+2H [36–38]. The spectrum reveals that in the initial stage, both carboxyl group of adsorbed HCOOH and formate species are also present, and then no significant carboxyl group or formate species remain as the reaction progresses. These findings indicate that HCOOH can be completely decomposed into CO2 and active hydrogens without formate accumulation on the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. According to the aforementioned spectroscopic analysis, we hypothesize that the different catalytic stabilities between Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 in transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH may be attributed to the accumulation of intermediate species resulting from distinct reaction pathways during HCOOH decomposition. It is well known that the decomposition of formate encounters a higher energy barrier than other reaction stpes of HCOOH decomposition, which is considered as the rate-limiting step. Additionally, our previous research has demonstrated that HCOOH can only undergo formate formation on Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Consequently, as indicated by the spectroscopic data, a significant formate signal persists in the HCOOH-DRFIT spectrum of Pd/TiO2 catalyst at its final state, suggesting substantial formate accumulation on the catalyst. From a mechanistic perspective, it is plausible that the accumulation of formate on the catalyst surface may hinder the active sites from interacting with reactants, thereby disrupting the catalytic process. The similar phenomenon has been documented in other reaction systems [39,40]. To further investigate this hypothesis, we conducted an HCOOH-DRIFTS experiment on the used Pd/TiO2 catalyst after five cycles of reactions. As illustrated in the Fig. 5(a), the formate signals in the HCOOH-DRIFT spectra of the used Pd/TiO2 catalyst remain nearly unchanged from the initial to final stages, which contrasts with the behavior observed for pristine Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This observation suggests that HCOOH no longer undergoes any significant reactions on used Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Indeed, the results of infrared transmission spectroscopy analysis of the used Pd/TiO2 catalysts after different reaction cycles (Fig. S10) indicate that a distinct formate signal appears in the spectrum after just one reaction cycle and becomes even more pronounced after five cycles. This finding suggests that formate derived from HCOOH decomposition tends to accumulate on the Pd/TiO2 catalyst surface. In contrast, the decomposition of HCOOH over the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst does not raise concerns regarding the accumulation of intermediate species that could potentially lead to catalyst deactivation. This is attributed to the fact that HCOOH can be completely decomposed on the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Our previous work had demonstrated that multi-atomic Pd ensembles were formed on the Zn-Pd alloy nanoparticles, which facilitated the dehydrogenation of HCOOH on the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst via the reaction pathway: HCOOH→COOH+H→CO2+2H [23]. It effectively mitigates the accumulation of formate commonly associated with Pd/TiO2 catalyst, which also explains why the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst is capable of catalyzing the complete decomposition of HCOOH. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the initial HCOOH-DRIFT spectra of used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst are comparable to those of pristine catalyst. Similarly, the final HCOOH-DRIFT spectra also show no significant signals corresponding to intermediate species, indicating that the complete decomposition of HCOOH continues to occur efficiently on the used Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst. Furthermore, no accumulated formate signal (1580 cm‒1) is observed in the infrared transmission spectra of the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst (Fig. S10). These analysis results elucidate why the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic stability during transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. The structural changes that cause irreversible deactivation of catalysts necessitate a complex regeneration process. By comparison, the coverage of adsorbed species on the catalyst surface results in reversible deactivation, which can be alleviated by employing appropriate treatment methods to remove these adsorbates. To validate the hypothesis that the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic stability compared to the Pd/TiO2 catalyst, we performed washing treatments for both catalysts after each cycle of reaction. This procedure aims to eliminate the formate accumulation on the surfaces of the catalysts, followed by an evaluation of their catalytic transfer hydrogenation performances. As shown in Fig. 6 , the catalytic activity of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst can be notably restored through washing with alkaline ammonia aqueous solution. Multiple rounds of reactions have demonstrated that this treatment consistently yields favorable outcomes. This further substantiates that the deactivation of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst during the reaction of transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH is primarily due to the accumulation of formate species on its surface rather than structural transformation. Moreover, it is noteworthy that washing the Pd/TiO2 catalyst with distilled water does not yield as significant recovery as washing with ammonia aqueous solution. It indicates that formate species has a strong affinity to the Pd/TiO2 surface and is difficult to be removed. In contrast, the absence of formate accumulation on the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst contributes to its superior catalytic stability. Consequently, regardless of whether treated with ammonia or water, the results of catalytic stability for the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst remain consistent with those obtained from untreated ones. This observation also reflects that the washing treatment do not adversely impact the catalytic transfer hydrogenation performance of the catalyst. Based on the above analyses, the different mechanisms in the catalytic stability of transfer hydrogenation of p-NP using HCOOH between Zn-Pd/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 can be clarified. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , it is confirmed that the influence of structural factors, such as pore structure of support, morphology and valence of metals, active site configuration, in the deactivation of both catalysts can be ruled out. In the case of Pd/TiO2 catalyst, HCOOH decomposition undergoes the following reaction pathway of HCOOH→HCOO+H. However, the further decomposition of formate species leads to the serious accumulation on the surface of the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This accumulation hinders the contact between reactants and active sites on the Pd/TiO2 catalyst, resulting in a substantial decline in catalytic activity and eventual deactivation. In contrast, on the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst, HCOOH can be completely decomposed into CO2 and active hydrogens via the reaction pathway of HCOOH→COOH+H→CO2+2H Consequently, the absence of the formate accumulation issue ensures that the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic stability in transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. 4 Conclusion In summary, this work demonstrates that the incorporation of Zn into Pd/TiO2 can significantly enhance the catalytic stability in low temperature transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. Various characterization results reveal that the primary reason for the deactivation of Pd/TiO2 catalyst is the substantial formate accumulation on its surface. Incorporation of Zn can alter the reaction pathway of HCOOH decomposition on Pd/TiO2 catalyst, which can effectively avoid the formate accumulation issue and thereby enable the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst to exhibit an excellent catalytic stability in low temperature transfer hydrogenation using HCOOH. This work presents a novel strategy by regulating the reaction route for the development of efficient and stable catalysts for transfer hydrogenation.

        "dc:description": "The limited catalytic stability of catalysts has long posed a challenge for the application of transfer hydrogenation technology, which can be performed under mild conditions. Based on the Pd/TiO2 catalyst, the effect of Zn addition on the catalytic stability in low temperature transfer hydrogenation using fomic acid (HCOOH) has been investigated. The results indicate the Pd/TiO2 catalyst exhibits rapid deactivation, with nearly complete loss of catalytic activity in five rounds of the reaction. In contrast, the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst shows almost no signs of deactivation throughout all reaction cycles. Various characterizations have ruled out the factors including Pd leaching, morphological and valence changes in Pd, and support collapse that can lead to deactivation. Spectroscopy data confirms that the primary reason for rapid deactivation of Pd/TiO2 is the accumulation of formate on the catalyst surface, which hinders the contact between active sites and reactants. Conversely, the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst does not experience similar issues as observed with Pd/TiO2. On the Zn-Pd/TiO2 catalyst, HCOOH undergoes complete decomposition into CO2 and active hydrogens through a different reaction pathway (HCOOH→COOH+H→CO2+2H). The present work demonstrates that altering the reaction pathway is an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic stablity of the catalyst in low temperature transfer hydrogenation.",
