Introduction In 1992-93, a total physical destruction of vanadium catalysts used in the sulfuric acid plants (Figs. 1-3) took place [1-3]. All factories were using gas evolved by roasting copper concentrate and used SC/SA technology (single conversion SO2 and single absorption of the sulfur trioxide). The destructed ring catalysts were of the 04-115 type (cesium-promoted sulfuric acid catalysts), and of the 04-111 type. The former type was utilised for 4 months on the 4th bed of the sulfuric acid converter, the latter, 2 years on the 1st bed converter A,B- streams (fast increase of the pressure drop on the first beds has been observed after 12 months).

Grzesiak et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 149-159 153 In a previous paper [3], a chemical composition of 'fresh' and used catalysts as well as the influence of changes in the active phase of the catalysts on the mechanical resistance were presented. A hypothesis clarifying the causes of the total destruction of catalysts was proposed. In order to determine the influence of the chemical composition of the catalyst, particularly the influence of a large iron content on the activity, the kinetic studies were conducted using fresh catalysts, samples already used in converters, and catalysts that underwent the total physical destruction. This paper, is an attempt to define the influence of iron content on catalyst activity and the process of physical destruction of the catalyst, based on the results of the kinetic studies. 2. Experimental The 'fresh' catalysts with an initial catalyst activity of various times of employment in contact processes, and samples of destructed catalysts of the 04-115 type (promoted with cesium compounds) and of the 04-111 type (recovery catalyst) were examined. The former type was utilised for 4 months on the fourth bed of the converter, and the latter for 2 years on the first beds. The chemical composition of those catalysts was established using the method described earlier [5]. The catalytic activity as a function of the reaction rate (W) against temperature was determined using the method described in [6] on a flow isothermal apparatus (Fig. 4).

Grzesiak et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 149-159 The reaction mixture with appropriate sulfur dioxide and oxygen content was generated by mixing sulfur dioxide with air and oxygen-free argon. The gas flow was controlled using an electronic regulator ERG equipped with a con- troller ERG-3. The air used for those experiments was dehydrated by means of molecular sieves 13X. Analysis of SO2 contents was performed using a mi- croculometric total sulfur analyser AN SO2. The measurements were based on automatic titration of iodine/KI solution (stabilized with acetic acid) and a mixture containing SO2 (SO3 free). The titration was run till the pre-pro- grammed end-point was reached. The total sulfur content (as % SO2) was determined by integration of the total current necessary to regenerate the iodine used. The electrochemical gas analyser was used simultaneously with the oxygen content analyser OM 200. The composition was as follows: SO2 -- 8% (V/V), 02 -- 13% (v/v), N N2 -- 79% (v/v), gas flow 0.3 N m3 s J The rate of the oxidation reaction was determined by calculation of the change of the SO2 concentration on both ends of the flow reactor (points A2 and A3) at fixed temperatures (380-600) and AT = 20. From the concentration values A2(T) and A3(T), the conversion was calculated using the formula: X(T) = 10000 [A2(T) - A3(T)]/[A2(T) (100- 1.5A3(T))] where, A2(T) -- SO2 concentration at A2 point-inlet of the reactor (%(v/v)) and A3(T) -- SO3 concentration at A3 point-outlet of the reactor (%(v/v)). The reaction rate (W) at the temperature T was calculated according to the formula: W(T) = lOOVso2X(r) gM-1 where Vso2 -- SO2 flow (dm3 s-l), M -- catalyst mass (g), g -- bulk density (g dm- 3). The error of the determination of rate constants did not exceed 0.005 (s-1 atm-~). Taking into account the reaction rate for the systems studied and using the Borieskov-Ivanov equation [7], the rate constants (k) of the oxidation process were calculated (Tables 3-6). The dependence of In k and 1/T allowed the calculation of activation parameters according to the Arrhenius equation. 3. Results and discussion The chemical composition of catalysts of the 04-115 and the 04-111 types is collected in Table 1, whereas the composition of these catalysts after 4 months (04-115) and 2 years (04-111) in the contact apparatus is given in Tables 2 and 3. The chemical composition of catalysts significantly changes in time. After 4 months, the content of vanadium in the 04-115 catalyst was decreased by 20%, P.

After 2 years, the content of vanadium in the 04-111 type catalysts was decreased by 40%, potassium by 30%, and iron by 60%. The maximum changes in the chemical composition did not exceed 0.3% for V205, and 0.5% for K20 in the yearly cycle of production. In both cases the decrease in vanadium and iron contents was greater than the decrease of the potassium content. This non-typical change of the chemical content is very characteristic of the surface salting-out of the elements of the active phase, which was found to occur in the above cases. The characteristic brown sinter was observed on all the samples except 'fresh' catalysts. 156 P.

Kaluski et al. [10] studied changes in the vanadium catalysts with an increased iron content (4.1% w/w). They found out that during the exploitation of the catalyst the promotor (potassium and vanadium) content decreased together with iron content. Calcium migrated from the beds working at higher temperatures to the shelves working at lower temperatures. For the catalysts studied, they also observed changes in the support (SiO2) structure during the utilisation. Chemical changes, salting-out, and the decrease of mechanical resistance show that the excess amount of iron compounds may cause a different behaviour of the catalysts studied. Therefore, after 1993, the manufacturer of these type of Table 5 Kinetic parameters of the SOz oxidation reaction for the 'fresh' catalyst and after 4 months of utilisation in a converter (4th bed) Temp.

The kinetic studies of iron-doped catalysts are illustrated in Tables 4-6. The 04-115 cesium catalyst shows great and systematic decrease of its catalytic activity defined as a decrease of the oxidation rate constant vs. utilisation time at temperatures below 420. For the utilisation time studied at 380, this decrease reached 40% after 2 months, and 55% after 4 months. At 420, the decrease was between 7 and 22% (Table 4). At higher temperatures the oxidation rate constants decreased less significantly. Additionally, we studied changes of the reaction rate for the ring catalyst 04-111 after 4 months of the utilisation time, which was loaded on the same bed on which the 04-115 type catalyst had worked. Additionally, the working temperature of this bed was set to 420. The results of the kinetic experiments are compared with those obtained using the 04-115 type catalyst for the utilisation time of 4 months. The results are collected in Table 5. These results show only small decreases of the oxidation reaction rate (less than 5% over the studied temperature range). This decrease is related to the 158 P.

The chemical composition of the 'fresh' catalyst (including the degree of initial sulfurization) and the catalyst after 4 months of utilisation was as follows: 'fresh' after 4 months V205 (% w/w) 6.8 6.6 K20 (% w/w) 11.0 10.8 Fe203 (% w/w) 4.6 4.2 The kinetic studies of the oxidation process using the 04-111 type catalysts taken from the first beds (A,B streams) after 2 years of utilisation showed that the catalytic activity over all the temperature ranges studied decreased signifi- cantly (Table 6). Catalyst taken from the surface of the first bed (A stream) showed 40% activity as compared with the 'fresh' catalyst. Even a greater decrease was found for the catalyst taken from the reactor bed depth. For the larger 10-30 cm from the surface this decrease amounts to 65%, whereas in bed depth (30-x) it exceeds 65% (at initial temperatures of 400-420 it reaches even 80%) (Fig. 5). This non-typical deactivation suggests that there must be an other deactiva- tion mechanism. The kinetic studies of the average catalyst sample with purified active surface taken from the first bed of stream B showed slight increase of activity for this catalyst as compared with the catalyst taken from various depths of the first bed of stream A. A characteristic of these changes leads to the conclusion that the deactivation mechanism is related to the changes in the active phase of the catalyst. For the 04-115 type catalyst (working at 380-460) the activation energy value (Table 4) decreases along with the utilisation time, and it is higher (20 kJ mo1-1) than for the 'fresh' catalyst. For the 04-111 catalyst (Table 5) after 4 months of utilisation a small (0.6 kJ tool 1) decrease of the activation energy is observed as compared to the 'fresh' catalyst. P. Grzesiak et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 149-159 159 After 2 years a bend on the Arrhenius plot is observed at 500 (Table 6) for the 04-111 catalyst (A, B streams). There is no dependence of the rate constants and temperature at 500-600, whereas at 400-480 the value of activation energy increases significantly with the depth of the catalyst bed. In the bed, depth is taken for measurements, which is a measure for the activation energy. To sum it up, we have reached the conclusion that a high iron content in the catalyst utilised in extremal conditions (high temperature and high partial pressure SO3) causes high decrease of the catalytic activity as a consequence of active phase changes.
