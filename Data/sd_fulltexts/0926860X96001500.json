High activity with high resistance to coke in the catalysts was confirmed by obtaining near equilibrium conversions of CO2 and methane as well as near equilibrium yields on CO and H2 for over 140 h of reaction. Coke deposition on the catalysts for the CO2-reforming reaction was remarkably diminished with the addition of alkaline promoters such as K and Ca oxides. This was attributed to the formation of carbonate species on alkaline promoters, mainly Ca, located adjacent to Ni sites and to the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on an Ni surface by the addition of alkaline promoters.

Chang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 growing importance of natural gas as the cheapest carbon-containing feedstock, the demand of synthesis gas having an H 2/CO ratio of one, and the combina- tion with steam reforming have also stimulated the studies on the CO2 reform- ing of methane [2]. CO2 reforming of methane (1) can produce CO-rich synthesis gas (H2/CO), which resembles conventional steam reforming (2): CO2 + CH4 ~ 2CO + 2H2, An8 = + 247kJ/mol (1) CO2 + H20 ~ CO + 3H2, A H28 = +206kJ/mol (2) This reforming reaction is highly endothermic, so relatively high reaction temperatures are necessary in order to get high yields of Hz and CO. The CO2-reforming reaction was studied over numerous supported metal catalysts such as Ni-based catalysts [2-8] as well as supported noble metal catalysts [9-14]. The catalysts based on noble metals are reported to be more active and less sensitive to coking than the Ni-based catalysts. However, considering the aspects of high cost and limited availability of noble metals, it is more practical, from the industrial standpoint, to develop Ni-based catalysts which are resistant to carbon deposition, and exhibit high activity for the reaction. Coke formation on Ni catalyst surfaces in the reforming reaction was known to deactivate the catalyst and plug the reactors [11]. In addition, it was known that the phase transformation, i.e., the formation of inactive NiA1204 spinel and sintering of metallic Ni particle on commercial alumina-supported Ni catalysts during the reforming reaction caused catalyst deactivation [3,4]. Especially, Gadalla and Bower [3] have pointed out that the formation of NiAI204 spinel could give rise to the disintegration of catalyst structure. The reforming activity of alumina-supported Ni catalysts can be suppressed by the presence of NiAI204 spinel because this tends to stabilize the nickel in the divalent oxidation state becoming hard to reduce. Therefore, for the reforming reaction it is desirable to develop a catalyst having a superior coke resistance and also to minimize the formation of NiAl204 spinel. It is possible that zeolites play a role as support of Ni catalysts for reforming reactions since they have some properties including high affinity for carbon dioxide as adsorbents, micropore structure, and high surface area [15]. To utilize these characteristics of zeolites for the reforming reaction and to prevent the formation of NiA1204 spinel, ZSM-5 type zeolite having high thermal stability mixed with an alumina as a minor component was used in this study as a support of the CO2-reforming catalyst. Previously, we have studied the effects of the preparation method, i.e., solid-state reaction vs. impregnation, on pentasil zeolite-supported nickel catalysts for the CO2 reforming of methane [16]. The present work is aimed at examining the catalytic behavior of zeolite-sup- ported Ni catalysts in more detail and the effects of alkaline promoters on the activity and coke formation in the COz-reforming. It is demonstrated that J.-S. Chang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 113 zeolite-supported Ni catalysts exhibit high performance for this reaction and there is little coke deposition under the given conditions by the addition of K and Ca promoters on this catalyst. 2. Experimental Zeolite-supported Ni and KNiCa catalysts were prepared and hybridized by the solid-state reaction method. Corresponding nitrate salts as metal precursors, having low melting points, were physically mixed with support. While the homogenized nitrate mixture was slowly heated in air up to 450 (2/min), it melted and gradually lost its water content. And then it was decomposed into metal oxides on the support at 650 for 4 h. The support which has been used was a high siliceous ZSM-5 zeolite (UOP S-115, SBEx = 340 m2/g, Si/A1 > 200) mixed with a 19.5 wt.-% alumina. In this study, zeolite-supported Ni and KNiCa catalysts prepared by the solid-state reaction method were designated as Ni/ZSI and KNiCa/ZSI, respectively. The loading of metallic nickel on both Ni/ZSI and KNiCa/ZSI was 5.3 wt.-%. The molar ratio of KNiCa oxide on KNiCa/ZSI was K:Ni:Ca = 0.08:1.0:2.2. The loading of total metal oxide content was 17.9 wt.-%. All the catalysts were reduced in the reactor with a hydrogen stream at 700 for 1 h, prior to each catalytic measurement. Catalytic measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor made from a 4 mm I.D. quartz tube at atmospheric pressure. The reactant gas mixture of the CO2-reforming reaction consisting of carbon dioxide and methane was diluted with nitrogen. The methane-carbon dioxide-nitrogen (molar ratio of CH 4:CO2 :N2 = 1 : 1:2.2) was introduced at atmospheric pressure to the reactor at 550-800. Space velocity of total gas mixture (GHSV) was 22 000-66 000 h- 1. The gaseous compositions of reactants, products, and nitrogen as an internal standard were analyzed by on-line gas chromatograph (Chrompack model CP 9001). The specific surface areas of the prepared catalysts were measured on a Micromeritics' sorption analyzer (model ASAP 2400). XP (X-ray photoelectron) spectra of C ls core level in the catalysts before and after reaction were measured by a VG ESCALAB Mark II photoelectron spectrometer using A1-K c~ radiation. Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of carbon deposits was performed by flowing over the used catalysts a gaseous mixture of 20% 02 in He with a flowrate of 50 ml/min from 25 to 800 and a temperature rise of 10/min. Weight loss of the used catalysts and CO2 gas produced during the TPO experiments were monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and on-line mass spectrometry (MS). The FT-IR spectroscopic studies were per- formed in a quartz vacuum cell using self-supported wafers which were treated under vacuum or underwent the same pretreatment as catalyst testing. The spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer model 2000 FF-IR spectrometer. 114 J.-S. Chang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Activities of supported Ni catalysts Supported and unsupported Ni catalysts were evaluated under a stoichiomet- ric feed with a molar ratio of CH4/CO2 = 1 at 700 and atmospheric pressure with high space velocity (GHSV = 6-104/h), as shown in Table 1. The catalytic activity was measured at the steady state after a reaction time of 4 h. The reaction products were composed of nearly equimolar amounts of CO and H2 with a trace of water. Both Ni/ZSI and KNiCa/ZSI catalysts were highly active for the CO2 reforming of methane. Conversions and yields over these catalysts were close to the equilibrium level under the given reaction conditions. However, in spite of very high loading of Ni, 32 wt.-%, unsupported KNiCa oxide was much less active than the supported KNiCa catalyst. It was shown that the hybridization of mixed metal oxides with ZSI support of high surface area could contribute to improve the catalytic activity through dispersion of nickel and alkaline metal oxides. Little deactivation was found over Ni/ZSI catalysts after the reaction for 4 h, but this showed severe coke deposition of 6.5% weight gain. Finally, the reaction over this catalyst suddenly stopped after 20 h due to blocking reactor tube by the accumulated cokes. In contrast, little catalyst deactivation and coke deposition was found on the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst. It was found that the surface area of KNiCa/ZSI catalyst as measured before catalytic testing considerably decreased compared to that of the Ni/ZSI catalyst (Table 1). However, this decrease in surface area did not affect the conversions and yields at a given temperature during the catalytic testing. It was considered that remarkable decrease in surface area of KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was ascribed to the strong interactions of alkaline promoters with silicon as well as aluminum in support and partial pore blocking via the intrusion of metallic components into Table 1 Catalytic activities of CO2 reforming of methane over supported and unsupported Ni catalysts a Catalyst b SBET Conversion (%) CO yield Formed (m2/g) c CH4 CO2 (%) coke d Ni/ZSI 287 78 78 77 6.5 KNiCa/ZSI 140 79 78 79 < 0.1 KNiCaOx < 5 54 49 52 < 0.1 Equilibrium - 79 79 79 - a T = 700, total pressure = 1 atm, molar ratio of CH4/CO2/N2 = 1:1:2.2, space velocity GHSV = 60000 h-I\" b Ni loading: 5.3 wt.-%. c Specific surface area of catalysts. d The coking rate on catalysts was defined as weight percentages of coke per hour of reaction time and weight of catalyst.

Effect of Ni loadings on the Ni/ZSI catalysts in the CO2-reforming reaction is shown in Table 2. Catalytic activities over Ni/ZSI catalysts were high enough when Ni loading exceeded over 2 wt.-%. It was not surprising that the activity was a function of the overall nickel content. However, there was an optimum loading beyond which an increase in nickel content did not produce any further significant increase in activity. Optimum Ni loading on the Ni/ZSI catalyst was approximately 5 wt.-%. Near equilibrium conversions and yields were attained over catalysts with more than 5.0 wt.-% of Ni loading, while these catalysts produced a large amount of coke. Among these, the catalysts with more than 7 wt.-% were rapidly deactivated to below two-third of the original activity in less than 4 h of the reaction time. The ratio of synthesis gas (H2/CO) produced over these catalysts under the given reaction conditions was above 1 due to faster decomposition of methane and thereby the deposition of surface carbon on the catalysts. Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of temperature on the CO2-reforming over the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst. It was obvious that the conversions and yields were greater with the rise of the reaction temperature in general being characteristic for reforming reactions. The equilibrium conversions and yields calculated from the equilibrium constant of the CO2-reforming reaction (1) were also shown as the dotted curves [17]. A small amount of water was formed together with CO and H2 produced from the CO2-reforming below 700. Water was formed possibly by the reverse water gas shift reaction (3) being thermodynamically more favorable than the CO2-reforming reaction at this temperature, CO2 + H2 ----) CO + H20, AH8= -41 kJ/mol (3) It was clear that the activity of the CO2-reforming over the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was attained almost in equilibrium at more than 700 at which the product was exclusively composed of equimolar amounts of CO and H2. 116 J.-S.

The effect of changing reactant ratios is shown in Fig. 3.

The notation for X(CO2), X(CH4), Y(CO), and Y(Ha) is the same as for Fig. 1. other conditions constant. It could be seen that conversions, yields, and the synthesis gas ratio produced were largely dependent on the change of the reactant ratios. When either reactant was in excess of more than about two-fold of the stoichiometry, it gave over 80% conversions of the other. As the CO2/CH4 ratio in the reactant feed increased, CH4 conversion linearly in- creased and was attained to more than 95% at CO2/CH4 > 2. In contrast, CO2 conversion gradually increased with the decrease of the CO2/CH4 ratio. The produced Ha/CO ratios of synthesis gas became higher ranging from 0.62 to 1.50 as the CO2/CH4 ratio in the reactant feed increased from 0.24 to 3.44. At a CO2/CH4 ratio of 1.0, the yields of CO and H2 were maximized and the ratio of Ha/CO was equal to about 1. It appeared that the optimum ratio of CO2 to CH4 for the highest yields on synthesis gas was 1. The Hs/CO ratio produced was also near unity when reactants with a COa/CH4 ratio of 1 was fed. 3.2. Coke formation during the COs-reforming Coke formation in the reforming of hydrocarbon is known to cause the catalyst deactivation [11]. According to thermodynamics, coke is expected to be formed mainly via the Boudouard reaction (4) and methane decomposition (5), which are favorable under CO2-reforming conditions [18,19]: 2CO~C(s)+COs, Kp=p(COs)/[p(CO)2] =0.510atm-lat700 (4) CH,--, C(~)+ 2Hs, Kp= [p(H~)S]/p(CH4)= 2.03atm at 700 (5) 118 J.-S. Chang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 In this work, coke formation on Ni catalyst surfaces was greatly affected by the addition of alkaline promoters and reaction conditions of the CO2-reforming. The Ni/ZSI catalyst showed considerable coke deposition of 6.5% weight gain at 700, while little coke deposition was found on the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst, as shown in Table 1. Coke deposit of the whisker type on the Ni/ZSI catalyst after the reaction were observed from electron microscopy [16]. In contrast, any type of coke on the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was not observed even after reaction of 140 h [16]. A remarkable effect of Ni loading level on the coke deposition was observed at 700 as presented in Table 2. Coke formation was greatly increased at higher Ni loadings. The amount of coke formed in the catalysts rapidly increased with the rise of Ni loadings at more than 5.3 wt.-%. Moreover, at more than 7 wt.-% of Ni loading accumulated cokes blocked the reactor tube, and then the reaction stopped within a few hours of reaction. The exceeding CO2 and CH4 conversions over equilibrium at 9.7 wt.-% Ni/ZSI catalyst implied that the products were not in dynamic equilibrium owing to high coke formation. Coke deposition on the supported Ni catalysts for the CO2-reforming reaction was also greatly affected by the CO2/CH4 reactant ratio. As the ratio of CO2/CH4 increased, the coke deposition became smaller due to the oxidizabil- ity of CO2 on surface carbon. In the molar ratio of CO2/CH4 = 3, coke deposition remarkably decreased to less than 0.1% weight gain on 5.3 wt.-% Ni/ZSI catalyst, as compared with that of the molar ratio of CO2/CH4 = 1. This observation agreed with that predicted by Gadalla and Bower [3]. Claridge et al. [19] reported that methane decomposition was found to be the principal route for carbon formation over a supported Ni catalyst during the oxyreforming of methane. In this study, methane in the reactants appeared to be also responsible for the carbon formation rather than carbon dioxide under the present reaction conditions. Fig. 4 compares the C l s XP spectra of supported Ni catalysts before and after the reaction. An additional carbonate C ls peak at 289.6 eV together with the adventitious carbon peak at 284.6 eV as a reference was observed in KNiCa/ZSI, while the former was not in Ni/ZSI. This means that surface carbonate species can be easily formed on KNiCa/ZSI due to added alkaline metals even at room temperature in air. An increase of this peak in KNiCa/ZSI was found after reaction at 800 for 140 h. It appeared that the adsorption of CO2 on the surface via carbonate species was helpful for the supply of surface oxygen to prevent the catalyst surface from accumulating coke during the reforming reaction [20]. More interesting is the observation that the carbidic C 1 s peak at 279.1 eV was much higher in intensity than the reference C ls peak in Ni/ZSI after the reaction at 700 for 4 h. This species was considered to be a direct coke precursor and greatly affected the coke formation in the Ni/ZSI catalyst. On the other hand, this was not found on the surface of the used J.-S.

KNiCa/ZSI catalyst after the reaction. It was shown that alkaline promoters remarkably suppressed the formation of carbidic carbons on the catalyst surface and promoted the gasification of coke formed during the reaction. In order to determine the nature and amount of coke deposits on the used nickel catalysts TPO experiments were performed. Fig. 5 shows the CO2 signal as a function of temperature during the TPO experiments performed after 4 h of reaction time for Ni/ZSI and 8 h for KNiCa/ZSI at 700. At least two types of carbonaceous species were found to exist on the catalyst, as shown on the TPO curve of the used Ni/ZSI catalyst after the reaction under normal conditions; the first low temperature peak with very weak intensity at 330 and the second one with high intensity around 640 (Fig. 5b). These peaks could be readily oxidized into carbon oxides below 700. It was noted that the intensity of high temperature peaks at 620 markedly increased with the increase of partial pressure of the reactants, which was closely related with the reactor blockage due to coke formation (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the evolved CO2 peak was 120 J.-S. Chang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 eq (a) (b) (e) L i I i I i I i 1~ 3~ 5~ 7~ 9~ Temperature () Fig. 5.

However, the lower temperature peak in the used KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was not observed and the intensity of higher temperature one was very small even after longer reaction time (Fig. 5c). It was suggested that the improved stability of the alkaline-promoted Ni catalyst was related to the relatively enhanced reactivity of carbonaceous species under the reaction condition. The alkaline-promoted Ni catalyst favored the removal of carbona- ceous species deposited on the catalyst surface and thereby secured the surface Ni sites to be active without coke formation. 3.3. The role of the alkaline promoters In a previous study, it was confirmed that alkaline promoters on ZSI-sup- ported Ni catalysts interacted strongly not only with silicon in zeolite component but also with aluminum in an alumina component [16]. It was confirmed that the CaAI204 phase in KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was formed by the reaction of the molten calcium nitrate salt with an alumina component as support. Because the CaA1204 phase has long been known to be a good support for steam reforming catalysts [3,4,18], the formation of this phase was considered to improve the coke resistance. The role of the zeolite in the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst was also considered to promote the catalyst stability by minimizing the formation of NiAI204 spinel and preventing the coke formation by diluting too active metallic Ni sites, and to interact with carbon dioxide as a favorable adsorbent [20]. J.-S. Chang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 121 Fig. 6 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the reduced KNiCa/ZSI catalyst after CO2 adsorption at 25 and the CO2-reforming reaction at 600. In the region of 1800-2100 cm-1, two weak absorption bands after CO2 adsorption at 25 appeared at 1875 cm-1 and 2005 cm-1 due to adsorbed CO with different coordination. This result demonstrates that CO can be produced by the dissocia- tive adsorption of COe on the catalyst surface even at room temperature. Martin et al. [21] have reported similar result for the CO2 adsorption at room tempera- ture on the Ni/SiOe catalyst. Stronger CO absorption bands after the reforming reaction at 700 were obtained with a little shift to a higher wavenumber comparing with that after CO2 adsorption at 25. In both cases of Fig. 6, the intensity of the CO stretching band at a lower wavenumber became higher than that at a higher wavenumber. It has been generally accepted that linearly adsorbed CO species give a band above 2000 cm-1 whereas adsorbed CO species with a bridged form give a band below 2000 cm-1 [22]. In this study, the band at the higher wavenumber could be assigned to linear CO species located on surface Ni sites, and the band at lower one could be assigned to bridged CO species in a two-fold structure on surface Ni sites. Besides the support, metallic Ni sites and CaO sites adjacent to metallic nickel surface in KNiCa/ZSI catalyst could be considered as major sites of the COe chemisorption. In addition, the presence of carbonate species due to mainly Ca promoter was confirmed on the KNiCa/ZSI catalyst [20]. These species could easily transfer to the adjacent metallic nickel surface via the CO2 chemisorption under the reaction conditions [20]. It was also found that the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the metallic Ni surface into CO and surface I I 0.05 1884 L < 1875 I I 2100 2000 1900 1800 Wavenumber (cma) Fig. 6. Difference FT-IR spectra of adsorbed species formed on the reduced KNiCa/ZSI catalyst in the range of 1800-2100 cm-I: (a) after the adsorption of 50 Ton- CO: at 25 for 30 rain and (b) after the CO2 reforming reaction under the same conditions as in Table 1 for 30 rain. These spectra were obtained with substraction from background of the reduced catalyst. 122 J.-S. Chang et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 oxygen and the removal of surface carbon species formed on Ni surface during the reforming reaction by adsorbed surface oxygen or adsorbed CO2 could be promoted by the addition of alkaline promoters. The chemisorbed amount of CO2 on the catalyst increased with the addition of alkaline promoters. These appeared to be closely related to the catalyst stability, namely coke resistance. Therefore, a tentative promotion scheme on coke prevention via the calcium carbonate intermediate could be suggested as follows: CaO(s) + CO2(g) ~ CaCOs(s) (6) CaCO3(s) + Ni-C(s) ~ CaO(s) + Ni-CO(s) + CO(g) (7) Ni-CO(s) ---} Ni(s) + CO(g) (8) (s): surface sites or adsorbed species and (g): gas phase species. It is known that alkaline metals decrease the acidity of the catalyst support and play a role of poison for the active nickel surface to some extent, which results in decreasing the rate of hydrocarbon cracking on the catalyst surface [23]. The addition of alkaline metals has also been found to change the nature and total quantity of carbon dioxide chemisorbed on nickel catalysts. The presence of alkaline metals on a reforming catalyst appears to allow a higher surface coverage of adsorbed CO2 which in turn allows an increase in the rate of reforming of hydrocarbon species at the expense of the competing reactions that lead to coke formation. It was confirmed that the addition of alkaline promoters on a ZSI-supported Ni catalyst exhibited superior coke resistance in this reaction. This addition promoted the removal reaction of coke precursors formed from methane and prevented the coke formation. The influence of K and Ca on the coking of Ni catalyst has been observed for the reforming of methane and carbon gasification with CO2 [6,7,24,25]. It was reported that the addition of alkaline promoters to catalysts was effective in preventing the coke formation from methane during steam reforming [24]. It was known that the catalyst ICI-46-9, which was developed as a methane reforming catalyst by ICI company, incorporates K promoters to resist carbon deposition [25]. Fujimoto et al. [6] pointed out that the addition of CaO on Ni catalyst exhibited stable activity without coke formation due to high basicity of CaO. Zhang and Verykios [7] reported that the addition of the CaO promoter to Ni/'y-A1203 resulted in an increase of reaction rate and an improvement of catalyst stability, which were related to enhanced reducibility of the promoted catalyst. Heinemann and Somorjai [26] reported that the KNi oxide catalyst showed markedly higher activity than either K20 or NiO for steam gasification of carbon. They also reported that KNiCa oxide catalysts were very highly selective on C2+-hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) via co-feeding with steam [27]. Their OCM activity could partly be ascribed to the activity for coke gasification with steam. In this study, the addition of alkaline promoters was important in contributing to the high J.-S. Chang et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 111-124 123 stability of the catalyst for the CO2-reforming reaction. The low coke forming ability of KNiCa/ZSI catalyst appeared to be attributed to the favorable interaction of Ca and support, and the favorable adsorption of CO2 induced by the addition of alkaline promoters. Further experiments are under way from which detailed information on the chemical state of nickel and promoters, and the role of support are expected. 4. Conclusions This work showed that the alkaline-promoted and zeolite-supported Ni cata- lysts exhibited high activity and coke resistance for the CO2 reforming of methane to synthesis gas. Stoichiometric yields of synthesis gas in the CO2-re- forming reaction over the catalysts were obtained with near equilibrium conver- sions of CO2 and methane. Coke deposition on the catalysts for the CO2-refor- ming reaction was also affected by reaction conditions and catalyst composition such as the reactant ratio of CO2 and CH4, and the Ni loading. The addition of alkaline promoters on zeolite-supported Ni catalysts resulted in superior coke resistance in this reaction. This was attributed to the favorable adsorption of CO2 on the surface adjacent to Ni sites to form carbonate species and to the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the Ni surface. It appeared that the supply of surface oxygen from this adsorption was helpful in preventing the build-up of surface carbon during the reaction.

The CO2 reforming of methane to synthesis gas was performed over pentasil-type zeolite-supported Ni catalysts. High activity with high resistance to coke in the catalysts was confirmed by obtaining near equilibrium conversions of CO2 and methane as well as near equilibrium yields on CO and H2 for over 140 h of reaction. Coke deposition on the catalysts for the CO2-reforming reaction was remarkably diminished with the addition of alkaline promoters such as K and Ca oxides. This was attributed to the formation of carbonate species on alkaline promoters, mainly Ca, located adjacent to Ni sites and to the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on an Ni surface by the addition of alkaline promoters.
