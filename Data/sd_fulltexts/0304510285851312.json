NUGENT and RONALD J. McKINNEY Central Research and Development Department, E.I. du Font de Nemours and Company, Experimental Station, Wilmington, DE 19898 (U.S.A.) (Received November 15, 1983; accepted May 9, 1984) Summary The rates of catalytic dimerization of alkyi acrylates by PdCl2(NCPh)2 and by [(0^4)^110!] 2 are greatly increased by the combination of a Lewis acid promoter and a proton source. For the rhodium systems, catalyst life was also enhanced and yields of up to 280 mol/mol Rh with > 98% selec- tivity to linear dialkyi hexenedioates have been observed. Optimal conditions involved the use of [(C2H4)2RhClJ2, Feda and methanol in the proportions 1:5:10 at 80 C. The isomeric composition of the product is markedly influenced by the combination of catalyst and promoter employed; either cis-A2, trans-A2, or trans-A3 hexenedioate may predominate. Thus on chang- ing the promoter from FeCl3 to SnCl4 in the Rh-catalyzed system, the product distribution changed from 85% trans-A2 to 62% cis-A2 hexene- dionate; certain Pd-catalyzed systems produced up to 60% of the isomeric A3 hexenedioates. Introduction The dimerization of functional olefins is a useful route to bifunctional molecules [1]. In particular, the linear dimerization of alkyi acrylates (eqn. (1)) is of industrial interest as a route to adipic acid from inexpensive feedstocks. >^\\ catalyst ^\\CO,R > RO,C^^^ +R02C^^/^ (1) ^ V COzR v x\\/ 'C02R la Ib This reaction was first achieved in these laboratories utilizing ruthenium chloride (at 210 C) or rhodium chloride (at 140 C) as the catalyst [2]. In 1969, Haszeldine and coworkers [3] demonstrated that palladium dichloride 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 66 also effected acrylate dimerization but that conversions were limited by the eventual reduction of the catalyst to palladium metal. Subsequent work has identified benzoquinone as a re-oxidant for the reduced palladium, allowing higher conversions [4]. Catalytic olefin dimerization has been the subject of extensive me- chanistic conjecture. For example, palladium-catalyzed dimerization has been variously proposed to involve palladium(I) dimers [5] or palladium(II) alky Is generated via olefin insertion into a Pd H bond [6]. Related dimeriza- tion reactions have been proposed to proceed via metallacyclopentane inter- mediates [7] and one can envision such a process in the present case as schematically illustrated in eqn. (2): / 1 ^ Pd ^ Pd H-Pd)> i- l ' - \\ I \"/ (2) In fact, palladacyclopentanes have been prepared and evidence has been presented for their thermal decomposition to Tr-allylpalladium hydride species [8]. Also of relevance is our observation that the Tr-allylpalladium chloride prepared from la, upon treatment with tributyltin hydride, afforded roughly equal amounts of la and Ib. It is also noteworthy that the structure of an iron metallacycle derived from two molecules of methyl acrylate has been reported [9]. Recently, increasing credence has been given to a mechanism for palladium-catalyzed acrylate dimerization involving oxidative addition into a vinyl C H bond to afford a vinyl-palladium hydride species [10, 11]. This is represented schematically in eqn. (3). (3) In addition to the experimental studies in refs. 10 and 11, it can be noted that insertion of ruthenium into a vinyl C H bond of methyl methacrylate has been shown to produce an isolable vinyl hydride species [12], Moreover, a deuterium labelling study has provided evidence for vinyl-ruthenium species in the catalytic dimerization of acrylonitrile [13]. In itself, eqn. (3) cannot readily explain the formation of significant amounts of the A3 hexenedioate Ib. However, Pracejus and Oehme [10b] have shown that the authentic vinyl-palladium complex 2, upon treatment with DC1, gave labelled Ib according to eqn. (4). 67 /c1 DC1 2 L,Pd. ^.D \" MeO;,CCD,CH=CHCD2C02Me (4) ^C=C ^ ^COzMe 2 Based on this stoichiometric reaction, it was proposed that a palladium carbene species formed by the equilibrium eqn.

It also can be noted that a mechanism analogous to eqn. (5) has been demonstrated for the initial carbene formation during olefin metathesis [15]. (Consistent with eqn. (5), we have observed intramolecular H D exchange between the 2- and 3-positions of methyl acrylate-3,3-d2 during catalytic dimerization. It is noteworthy that this intramolecular exchange is observed in those catalysts (ZnCl^/Pd, CdC^/Pd) which produce large amounts of A3 dimer, while other catalysts (AgBF4/Pd, Fed3/Rh) exhibit intermolecular exchange. However, the intramolecular exchange could also arise via addition-elimination of a palladium hydride to acrylate at a rate much faster than acrylate dissociation.) In our opinion, the mechanism of catalytic acrylate dimerization remains unresolved. In this paper we report our observation that the com- bination of a Lewis acid promoter and a proton source can markedly influ- ence the rate, yield, and product composition in catalytic acrylate dimeriza- tion. However, we shall defer detailed mechanistic interpretation of our results until a clearer understanding of the dimerization mechanism is in hand. Results and discussion Effect of Lewis acids Oehme and Pracejus have shown that complete removal of chloride from PdC^NCPh)^ using AgBF4 greatly increases the rate of Pd-catalyzed acrylate dimerization [16]. However, in our hands, the yield of dimers under guch conditions was limited to about 25 mol/mol Pd. It occurred to us that the combination of a Group VIII metal halide and a less powerful Lewis acid might afford high rates of dimerization without sacrificing catalyst life. The rate-enhancing effect of Lewis acids in other catalytic reactions has been amply documented [17]. 68 TABLE 1 Effect of Lewis acids on the rhodium-catalyzed dimerization of ethyl acrylate\" Lewis Acid Equivalents Time1' Catalyst turnovers (h) Me;)SnCl 5 2 C SbCIs 5 2 C A1C13 5 2 0.1 LiCI 8 3.5 0.2 BCl3 8 3.5 1.0 PhaSnCI 5 5 2.7 CpaTiCIa 5 15 3.1 Ti(OiPr)4 5 5 4.1 AgBF4 1 3 6.4 TiC^THF), 5 5 11 PhSnds 5 72 12 HC1 10 15 16 CuzClz 5 15 24 PhHgCl 5 16 31 POC13 5 16 32 RuCIa- 3H;>0 5 17 36 ZnCI, 4 15 37 HgCl, 5 17 60 SnCLt 5 16 68 FeCl3 5 17 150 \"All reactions involve 0.25 mmol [RhCl(C;2H4)2]2 and 2.5 mmol methanol in 25 ml ethyl acrylate at 90 C. ''No further reaction detected after indicated time. c Reaction mixture polymerized. Table 1 shows that in the presence of Lewis acids, acrylate dimerization by [(Czl-LO^RhCl^ occurred at 90 C. No dimer was formed at this temper- ature in the absence of Lewis acid. The reactions listed in Table 1 also in- clude a small amount of methanol as a proton source (see below). It can be seen from Table 1 that the yield of dimer is extremely dependent on the nature of the Lewis acid, with FeCly being the best of those tested. A ratio of FeCl3:Rh of 5:1 was found to be optimal at 90 C. (One can conceive of three distinct roles that FeCl3 might be playing in this system: (1) reversible removal of chloride ion to afford a cationic rhodium species, (2) reoxidation of reduced rhodium metal to the +1 state, (3) providing a source of HC1 by the protonolysis of some Fe Cl bonds. It is not possible at present to identify which of these functions are important.) A further increase in yield from the FeC^-promoted reaction could be obtained (at the expense of a decrease in rate) by a slight reduction in tem- perature. Thus, using the same catalyst as in Table 1 (Rh:FeCl3:MeOH = 1:5:10) but at 75 C, a dimer yield of 280 mol/mol Rh could be achieved after 90 h. This system was readily adapted to the preparation of synthetical- ly useful [1] la. For example, ethyl acrylate (50 ml) was treated with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 (2 mmol), FeCl3 (10 mmol) and methanol (20 mmol) at 69 TABLE 2 Effect of Lewis acids on dimerization of methyl acrylate by PdO^NCPt^'1 Additive Equivalents Dimers (mol/mol Pd) t= 0.5 h t= 17 h none 0.3 6.0 AgBF4 2 25 26 AgPF<, 2 25 29 Ag03SCF3 2 1.3 1.6 AgF 2 0.2 0.7^ ZnCI^ 2 7.7 18 CdCl,'' 2 12 15 HgCl^ 2 0.8 6.7 B(Ph)3 2 0<1 SnCl4 2 <0.1 <0.1 AlC^ 4 0.1 20 FeCl3e 4 1.8 8 CoClz6 4 0.2 1.0 NiCI^ 4 3.4 5 \"All runs involve 1.0 mmol PdC^NCPh), in 50 ml methyl acrylate at 60 C. bYield at time 1.0 h.

The Lewis acids ZnCI; and CdCl^ similarly enhanced the rate of acrylate dimerization by (PhCN^PdC^ (Table 2). However, catalyst life remained comparable to that in the AgBF4-promoted reaction. Yields were relatively insensitive to Lewis acid concentration, but with either ZnClz or CdCl; as promoter, a Pd/Lewis acid ratio of 1:1 appeared optimal. Effect of proton source Dimer yields using the ZnClz-promoted (PhClSQzPdC^ catalyst system were initially found to vary erratically from run to run. This irreproducibility was traced to low levels of methanol in commercial methyl acrylate. Sub- sequently, we found that removal of methanol from acrylate with activated 4A molecular sieves eliminated the erratic behavior but also greatly reduced the initial rate of dimerization. Moreover, the original rate could be re- covered by addition of methanol in amounts equivalent to the Pd concentra- tion. Although we have not carried out detailed kinetic studies on this reac- tion, the extent of this rate effect can be seen by comparing the dimer yield data for t = 0.5 in Table 3. It is not possible at present to fully explain the role of methanol in this system. For example, methanol may reduce some of the Pd to an active hydridopalladium intermediate or to palladium(I) species. Alternatively, it 70 TABLE 3 Effect of alcohols on ZnClj-promoted dimerization of sieve-dried acrylate using Fdd^L;'1 Dimer yield (mol/mol Pd) ( = 0.5 h t = final L Alcohol benzonitrile benzonitrile benzonitrile pivalonitrile pivalonitrile none methanol trifluoroethanol none methanol 0.3 7.7 0.4 0.3 6.9 7,5 18 14 8.4 20 \"All runs involve 1.0 mmol Fdd^La, 3.0 mmol ZnCI; and 1.0 mmol alcohol (when pres- ent) in 50 ml methyl acrylate at 50 \"C. may serve to generate low concentrations of HC1 which are necessary for catalysis. At this time we can only note several observations which appear pertinent to this question: (1) The non-nucleophilic proton source, trifluoroethanol, did not enhance the initial rate of dimerization (Table 3). (2) When 50 ml of methyl acrylate containing (PhClS^PdCl; (1 mmol) and Znd2 (2 mmol) was treated with methanol (0.25 to 2.00 mmol) at 55 C, a small amount of methanol was consumed in the first 30 min. Capillary column GC showed the amount consumed to be 0.21 0.03 mol/mol Pd. No further consumption of methanol occurred on further heating. (3) GC-mass spectroscopic analysis of this reaction mixture after 0.5 h at 55 C showed the formation of methyl 3-chloropropionate and methyl 3-methoxypropionate in amounts comparable to the methanol consumed. Methyl (3-methoxyacrylate was not observed. (No sample of authentic methyl (3-methoxyacrylate was available. The experiment was repeated with ethyl acrylate and ethanol as proton source inasmuch as a sample of ethyl (3-ethoxyacrylate was available. Again, at 60 C, no ethoxyacrylate was detected. It is noteworthy that, when the reaction was run at 90 C, discrete quantities of ethyl jS-ethoxyacrylate were observed.) (4) A similar reaction involving the CdCl; promoter and one equivalent of MeOD with C^Dg as internal standard was examined by ^ NMR after 2 h at 60 C. It was shown, after correction for naturally-occurring ^H, that 46% of the ^ charged was incorporated into the three vinylic positions of methyl acrylate. Another 33% appeared in acrylate-derived products (dimer, chloropropionate and methoxypropionate) but no ^ was incorporated in methoxy groups.

HC1 was previous- ly suggested to be a necessary component in Cramer's Rh-catalyzed dimeriza- tion of ethylene [6]. This effect was attributed to the oxidative addition of HC1 to Rh\"1\" to afford a catalytically-active rhodium hydride species. Isomer distribution By resorting to capillary column GC, it was possible to separate and quantify all four isomers of the product hexenedioates. On a dimethyl silicone column, these eluted in the order cis-A2, cis-A3, trans-A3, trans-A2. Assignments were made as follows: the trans-A2 isomer could be isolated by hydrolysis of its crystalline 1:1 adduct with LiBF4 as described previously [1]. The ci's-A2 dimer was isolated by liquid chromatography on silica and fully characterized. Assignment of the trans-A3 isomer was made by com- parison with an authentic sample prepared by methylation of a commercial sample of the trans-A3 diacid. The assignment of the fourth isomer, dimethyl ci's-A^hexenedioate, rests on its GC-MS analysis and on the fact that hydro- genation of a mixture containing 11% of this material produced 97% of di- methyl adipate and only 3% of branched dimethyl-2-methylglutarate. In no case were significant yields of branched dimers observed. Typ- ically, several tiny peaks appeared in the gas chromatogram which we attrib- ute to these branched species. However, hydrogenation studies showed that the total yield of branched dimers was < 3% for the CdC^ and ZnClz-promoted Pd catalyst and <2% for the FeCl3 and SnC^-promoted Rh catalyst. The Pd catalyst with AgBF4 promoter afforded < 1% branched dimers. We have found that the distribution of linear product isomers from acrylate dimerization is markedly dependent on the combination of catalyst and promoter used (Table 5). For instance, changing the promoter from FeCl3 to SnCl4 in the Rh-catalyzed dimerization changed the ratio of trans- 72 TABLE 5 Effect of catalyst and promoter on isomer distribution from dimerization of methyl acrylate Catalyst Promoter Isomeric hexenedioates as % of total'1 ci's-A2 ci's-A3 trans-A3 trans-^\\2 PdCl^NCPh):,1' ZnCl2(l) 2 12 48 37 PdCl^NCPh);,1' CdCl-t(l) 3 15 51 31 PdCl^NCPh):;11 AgBF4(2) 4 1 4 91 [RhCl(C2H4)2]c FeCl3(5) 6 3 6 85 [RhC^C^H^y SnCl4(5) 62 1 4 33 a Linear dimers only (see text).

Pd catalysis with the AgBF4 promoter produced overwhelmingly the trans-A2 dimer. Remarkably, the same catalyst with a CdCIa promoter produced 66% of the contrathermo- dynamic A3 isomers. Concluding remarks This research constitutes another [17] demonstration of the improve- ments in rate, yield and selectivity which can be achieved by addition of Lewis acid promoters to transition metal-catalyzed reactions. This effect is especially obvious in the case of the rhodium-catalyzed dimerization, where it has been possible to reduce the literature [2] reaction temperature from 140 C to 75 C with a 60-fold increase in the yield of dimers. We feel that this improved reaction now represents an attractive synthetic tool. We find the marked changes in product distribution, which are observed upon changing the Lewis acid component, to be quite remarkable. From a mechanistic point of view, these results show that both the catalyst and the promoter must be intimately involved in the product-determining step of this reaction. These results represent another source of interest in the detailed mechanism of acrylate dimerization, which remains a challenging and important problem for future studies. Experimental section Analytical Packed-column GC analyses were carried out on a 12 ft X 1/8 ft column of 10% SE-30 on AnaKrom ABS using undecane as internal standard. Analyses were isothermal with a column temperature of 180 C for runs 73 using methyl acrylate and 200 C for runs using ethyl acrylate. Detailed isomer distributions were obtained using a 50 ft crosslinked methyl silicone fused-silica capillary column programmed from 60- 200 C at 8 C min\"'. The 61.4 MHz 'H-decoupled ^H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker WM 400 spectrometer. 'H NMR spectra were determined on a Nicolet NT 360 WB spectrometer as solutions in CDC^. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million downfield from the internal reference tetramethylsilane. Coupl- ings (J) are in hertz. Materials Methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate were dried at least 24 h prior to use by means of activated 4A molecular sieves. The molecular sieves were acti- vated by heating 48 h at 400 C followed by cooling in vacuo. The catalysts PdCl;;(NCPh);; [18] and [RhO^C;^);,^ [19] were prepared according to literature procedures. Lewis acids were anhydrous reagents used without further purification. Catalysts, Lewis acids and monomers were all stored in a glove box filled with dry nitrogen. Palladium-catalyzed dimerization (typical procedure) In a 200 ml flask with side-arm were placed methyl acrylate (50 ml, 555 mmol), undecane internal standard (1 ml) and the Lewis acid additive (1 to 4 mmol). To this solution was added bis(benzonitrile)palladium di- chloride (0.38 g, 1.0 mmol). The flask was attached to a water-cooled con- denser maintained under dry nitrogen by means of an oil bubbler. (The nitrogen atmosphere was used for exclusion of moisture only; control experi- ments showed no difference when reactions were run under dry oxygen.) The mixture was stirred in a pre-heated oil bath at 60 C. Samples for GC analysis were removed periodically by briefly opening the side-arm while maintaining a flow of nitrogen. Rhodium-catalyzed dimerization (typical procedure) Using the same apparatus as in the preceding example, the following materials were charged in the flask: ethyl acrylate (25 ml, 231 mmol), bis(ethylene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer (0.05 g, 0.25 mg-atom Rh), un- decane internal standard (0.5 ml), methanol (100 jul, 2.5 mmol), and Lewis acid (2 to 10 mmol). The reaction was heated at 90 C and sampled as de- scribed above. Preparative scale reaction A mixture of ethyl acrylate (50 ml, 461 mmol), bis(ethylene)rhodium (I) chloride dimer (0.4 g, 2 mg-atom Rh), iron(III) chloride (1.62 g, 10 mmol) and ethanol (1.17 ml, 20 mmol) was stirred at 80 C for 30 h. The resultant mixture was added to ether (200 ml) and extracted with saturated sodium bicarbonate (100 ml). The organic layer was dried (MgSO^) and the ether and unreacted ethyl acrylate were removed under reduced pressure. Distillation at 88 - 90 C and 0.6 torr afforded 33 g (71%) of colorless oil consisting of 1 as the mixed isomers. 74 Analysis: Calculated for CloU^O^: C, 59.98; H, 8.07%; found: C, 59.60; H, 8.07%. This material, which contained 91% of c;'s- and (rans-la as determined by GC, was suitable for further elaboration by the conjugate addition/ cyclization reaction [ 1 ]. Isolation of dimethyl cis-hex-2-enedioate, (cis-la) The reaction of methyl acrylate (25 ml), bis(ethylene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer (0.05 g), tin(IV) chloride (0.32 g) and methanol (0.08 g) was carried to 12% conversion (20 h, 75 C). The product was dissolved in ether (100 ml) and extracted with 5% sodium bicarbonate (100 ml). After removal of solvent and unreacted monomer at reduced pressure, a 1.25 g sample of the residue was flash-chromatographed over 100 g of 230 - 400 mesh silica (EM Reagents) following the general procedure of Still [20] with 30% ethyl acetate/hexane as eluent. Removal of solvent from fractions 6+7 afforded 0.58 g of pure cfs-la as a colorless oil.

'H NMR: 2.45-2.58 (m, 4H), 3.69 (s, 3H), 3.73 (s, 3H), 5.87 (d, J = 16, 1H); 6.96 (d of ts, J = 16, 6, 1H). Dimethyl trans-hex-3-enedioate (trans-lb) Authentic material was prepared by treatment of commercial '-A3- dihydromuconic acid (Aldrich) with methanolic BFa. ^ NMR: 3.11 (m, 4H); 3.68 (s, 6H); 5.69 (m, 2H). Hydrogenation of product dimers Unreacted monomer was removed at reduced pressure and the filtered product was redissolved in ethyl acetate (ca. 10X volume of sample). The solution was treated with H^ (40 Ib) over 5% palladium on charcoal in a Parr shaker overnight. Hydrogenation was complete by GLC. The relative area of dimethyl 2-methylglutarate vs. dimethyl adipate by GLC was taken as the percentage of branched isomers in the product. Methyl aery late-1,1-d^ A mixture of methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (52 g, 155 mmol), paraformaldehyde-d^ (5.0 g, 156 mmol), hydroquinone (0.05 g) and dry dibutyl phthalate (100 ml) was treated for 1.5 h at 80 C and then for 0.5 h at 120 C. On cooling, part of the side-product triphenylphosphine oxide precipitated and was removed by filtration. The product was removed from the remaining solution by vacuum transfer into a liquid nitrogen-cooled U-trap using dynamic vacuum. The product (9.4 g, 68%) was dried by sequential treatment with 4A molecular sieves. GC and NMR analysis 75 showed the final product contained ca. 1% of methyl acetate. 2!-! content at the terminal vinyl position was > 99.8%. TT-Ally {palladium chloride complex of 1 This material was prepared by a slight modification of the general pro- cedure of Trost [21]. A solution of palladium trifluoroacetate (1.00 g, 3.2 mmol) and dimethyl trans-hex-3-enedioate (0.55 g, 3.2 mmol) in ethyl acetate (75 ml) was stirred for 1 h at 25 C. The solution was filtered through Celite and the solvent was removed under high vacuum. The resultant brown oil was redissolved in 75 ml ethyl acetate and was stirred 0.15 h with 5 g of Amberiyst3' 27A ion exchange resin. Removal of the solvent at reduced pressure left a yellow powder (0.73 g, 73%) which, after recrystallization from CHCl3/hexane, had spectroscopic properties identical to those reported by Tsuji [221.

Nugent Ronald J. McKinney Central Research and Development Department, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Experimental Station, Wilmington, DE 19898 U.S.A. The rates of catalytic dimerization of alkyl acrylates by PdCl2(NCPh)2 and by [(C2H4)RhCl]2 are greatly increased by the combination of a Lewis acid promoter and a proton source. For the rhodium systems, catalyst life was also enhanced and yields of up to 280 mol/mol Rh with > 98% selectivity to linear dialkyl hexenedioates have been observed. Optimal conditions involved the use of [(C2H4)2RhCl]2, FeCl3 and methanol in the proportions 1:5:10 at 80 °C. The isomeric composition of the product is markedly influenced by the combination of catalyst and promoter employed; either cis-Δ2, trans-Δ2, or trans-Δ3 hexenedioate may predominate. Thus on changing the promoter from FeCl3 to SnCl4 in the Rh-catalyzed system, the product distribution changed from 85% trans-Δ2 to 62% cis-Δ2 hexene-dionate; certain Pd-catalyzed systems produced up to 60% of the isomeric Δ3 hexenedioates.
