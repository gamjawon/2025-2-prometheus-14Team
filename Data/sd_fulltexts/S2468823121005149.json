In this work, Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts were prepared by sol-gel method with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the carbon source and dispersant, and applied in the dry reforming of biogas. The roles of ratio of Ni/Mo as well as β-CD on the catalytic activity and stability were analyzed. Systematic characterizations analysis such as XRD, XPS, and TEM confirm that Mo2C can only form under the condition of pre-reduction and carburization, confirming that metallic Ni nanoparticles promote the carbonization process of Mo2C, and that β-CD as a carbon source is of great necessity for the formation of Mo2C. In the dry reforming of biogas, the formation of Mo2C significantly impacts the catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for CO2 activation and coke removal via the redox cycle. Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts with optimized Ni and Mo contents of 7 and 15 wt%, respectively, exhibit the best catalytic activity and stability for the dry reforming of biogas. The CH4 and CO2 conversion rates remained above 90% and 85%, respectively, for 200 h at 850 °C and WHSV = 30,000 ml. g−1. h−1.

At present, the dependence on fossil fuels to meet energy demand has caused great environmental problems through anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Methane and carbon dioxides are the most notorious gasses contributing to global warming [3,4]. The biogas, with CH4 and CO2 as the major components, can be utilized to generate syngas through the reforming process [5,6]. The generated syngas can be further converted into hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch process [7–9]. It is well known that the CH bond in CH4 is difficult to be activated, and CO2 is the upmost oxidized state of carbon, which is also very stable [10]. Therefore, the simultaneous activation of both CO bond in CO2 and CH bond in CH4 is a great challenge. The dry reforming of biogas is usually conducted at high temperature (∼800 °C), and the presence of catalysts could significantly lower the required activation energy for the CO bond in CO2 as well as the CH bond in CH4. The noble metal-based catalysts display satisfying catalytic activity and stability in the dry reforming of biogas [11]. However, the applications of noble metal-based catalysts at the industrial scale are restricted by their high prices. The Ni-based catalysts exhibit similar activity to noble metal in dry reforming of the biogas, but suffer from easy deactivation due to the sintering as well as coke deposition caused by methane decomposition (i.e., CH4→C + 2H2) as well as CO disproportionation (i.e., 2CO→CO2+C) [12]. A variety of strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of the Ni-based catalysts, including adoption of suitable supports (e.g., metal oxides with basic sites or rich oxygen vacancy to activate CO2) [13,14], and bimetallic catalysts [15]. The alkaline-earth oxide (e.g., MgO) positively impacts the coking inhibition due to its strong CO2 adsorption property [13]. In recent years, transition metal carbides such as molybdenum carbide, with noble metal-like properties, have attracted great interest in dry reforming of biogas [16–18]. Shi et al. mentioned that metal carbides and oxides can circulate in the alternating flow of CO2 and CH4 s, and that metal carbides exhibit stable catalytic activity at atmospheric pressure in the dry reforming of biogas [19]. Yao et al. also demonstrated that CO2 activation can occur on Mo2C with oxidation-recarburization cycle [20]. Ni-Mo2C/MgO have been demonstrated to exhibit great activity for the dry reforming of biogas, due to the presence of dual active-site and the corresponding catalytic redox cycle in the following manner, Mo2C activates CO2, then oxygen species in CO2 replace the carbon of Mo2C, while Ni dissociates CH4 and promotes the reduction of molybdenum oxides to molybdenum carbide [13,19]. It is worth noting that the contents of Ni and Mo are very important to stabilize the bimetallic carbide systems [19]. The high content of Ni promotes the dissociation of CH4 and result in quick coke formation, while lower content of Ni facilitates oxidation of Mo2C by CO2. Therefore, optimized contents of Ni and Mo are important to maintain the catalytic oxidation-carburization cycle and stable biogas conversion rates [21]. β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a macrocyclic oligosaccharide [22]. Recently, β-CD has been widely used in catalysis and biomaterials. It is usually used as a structure-directing agent and modifier for small-size metal particles such as Pd and Pt. The β-CD with an inherent cavity is a typical benign molecule in super-molecular chemistry [23,24]. It is well known that doping β-CD can inhibit Ni deactivation due to β-CD's ordered structures and large specific surface areas that facilitates Ni dispersion [25]. On the other hand, β-CD, as a small organic molecule, is also a good carbon source. Generally, transition metal carbide catalysts are prepared under the flow of CH4 and H2 gasses [26]. Until now, there are few reports on direct synthesis of Mo2C in biogas flow. In the present work, the sol-gel method was adopted for the loading Ni-Mo2C on MgO [27,28], and β-CD was utilized as a dispersant and carbon source. The in-situ synthesized Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst was formed at atmospheric pressure with stable activity, and maintained its stability for up to 200 h compared to other Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst prepared without β-CD. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Citric acid (C6H8O7, AR≥99.5%), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, AR≥98.0%), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24∙4H2O, AR≥98%), and β-cyclodextrin (C42H70O35, AR≥98.0%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co, Ltd. China. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2•6H2O, AR≥98.0%) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)2•6H2O, AR≥99.0%) were purchased from Shanghai SuiShi Chemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol (C2H6O, AR≥95.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. 2.2 Catalyst preparation method Bimetallic Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts were prepared via the sol-gel method. The synthesis gel was prepared by mixing an aqueous solution (10 mL) of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, the molar ratio of Ni+Mo to β-cyclodextrin is 60:1. After the addition and complete dissolution of β-CD, MgO was added into the mixed aqueous solution. The solution was then heated to 80 °C, followed by addition of citric acid. The mixture was kept at 80 °C for 30 min, and then ethylene glycol was added to it, and further stirred at 80 °C for another two hours until a gel was formed. The generated sol-gel was further dried at 105 °C and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating ramp rate of 5 °C /min. Several samples, with Mo concentration range of 10, 15, and 20 wt% as well as Ni contents of 5 and 7 wt% were prepared, and designated the abbreviated titles of 5Ni-10Mo2C/MgO, 5Ni-15Mo2C/MgO, 5Ni-20Mo2C/MgO, 7Ni-10Mo2C/MgO, 7Ni-15Mo2C/MgO, and 7Ni-20Mo2C/MgO. Based on our analysis, 7Ni-15Mo2C/MgO was the optimal composition, therefore, was used throughout the study. After to the reaction, the catalyst was passivation with pure CO2 at Room temperature for 24 h. CO2 was allowed to pass through the catalyst bed at a flow rate 20 mL/min. and the product was denoted as Ni-Mo2C/MgO post-passivation. The same sol-gel method was used without addition of β-CD, and the product was denoted as Ni-Mo/MgO. In addition, similar sol-gel method was used to prepare Ni- and Mo-only catalysts, and the products were called Ni/MgO and Mo/MgO respectively. Finally, a wet impregnation method was used to prepare catalysts with Mo and Ni contents of 15 and 7 wt%, respectively, and the product was called Ni-Mo2C/MgO (IW). 2.3 Catalysts’ characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro-MPD) equipped with a Cu Kα source, and the data were collected in the 2θ range of 10–80° diffractograms. The morphology of fresh and spent catalysts was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss sigma 300). The sample was coated with gold to improve sample conductivity for enhanced magnification imaging. The SEM analysis was operated at 10 kV, followed by additional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis using a Titan G260–300 microscope. The lattice fringes and electron diffraction patterns were detected in HRTEM images using Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform analysis. We also performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source Kratos Axis ultra (DLD). The charging effects were corrected based on adventitious carbon (284.6 eV) referencing. Raman spectroscopy was also performed using a Horiba Evolution spectrometer with 632.8 nm line of a helium-neon laser as an excitation source. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were acquired at −196 °C in an ASAP 2460 device upon degasification of materials at 300 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermal analysis (TG-DSC) tests were also performed using an STA 449 F3 coupled thermo-analyzer. For this test, the samples were heated in a stream of air-gas at 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 900 °C. 2.4 Performance evaluation of catalysts The performance of prepared carbide catalysts were evaluated at atmospheric pressure using a fixed bed reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. 200 mg of catalyst was sandwiched by quartz wool, and was placed at the center of the vertical reactor, which was placed in a furnace electrically being heated under atmospheric pressure. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in the flow of a gas mixture (60 mL, H2:N2=1:9) at 850 °C for 1 h. The produced gas in the reactor was analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent 6890 N) with TCD using Ar as the carrier gas. The GC unit was also equipped with both a molecular sieve column (for separation of CH4, O2, N2, H2 and CO) and a Porapak Q column for separation of CO2. The CH4 and CO2 conversions were calculated using the standard normalization method on the basis of carbon atoms balance [29]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical properties of the catalysts The surface area of Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst was obtained at 86.4 m2/g, its pore volume was measured at 0.22 cm3/g, with a mean pore size of 11.9 nm. The BET adsorption and desorption profiles of Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst are presented in Figure S1. The effects of β-CD addition, as well as the individual incorporation of Ni and Mo on formation of Mo2C catalyst are shown in Fig. 1 a. For the sample with β-CD, the XRD patterns obviously revealed the diffraction peaks of Mo2C at 34.4, 38.0, 39.4, 52.1, 61.5, 69.6, 74.6, and 75.5°, which respectively correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112) and (201) reflections [30]. This sample also showed the diffraction peaks of MgO (JCPDS 45–0946) support with the main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.9, 42.9, 62.3, 74.7 and 78.6° as well as the peaks for MoO2 at 2θ = 26.0. The results indicated that these Mo precursors could be carburized by β-CD to Mo2C [13]. However, no peaks corresponding to Mo2C were observed for the sample without β-CD addition. Therefore, the addition of β-CD is of great necessity for the formation of Mo2C. For the sample with Ni, we only observed the diffraction peaks corresponding to Ni and MgO. Following addition of Mo, we also observed the peaks for MgO and Mg2Mo3O8 [30]. For the samples with only Ni or Mo added, Mo2C peak was not observed. These results show that the formation of Mo2C is impossible if only Mo and β-CD were added, indicating the essential role of Ni and β-CD on the formation of Mo2C The impacts of the content of Ni and Mo on Ni-Mo2C/MgO samples are presented in Fig. 1b. The Mo and Ni concentrations vary over the 5–20 and 5–7 wt%, respectively. These catalysts’ precursors could be carburized to molybdenum carbides by addition of β-CD. It was also observed that the Mo2C diffraction peaks of samples with 15–20 wt% Mo became stronger with increasing content of Mo. The precursor of Ni-Mo2C/MgO only shows the diffraction peaks of MgO, and the diffraction peaks of Ni was observed after the sample was reduced (Figure S2a). We also did not find the Mo2C peak for the Ni-Mo2C/MgO (IW) sample (Figure S2b). This also confirms that the sol-gel technique is an effective methodology for the Mo2C formation. XPS analysis of Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts were also conducted (Fig. 2 ), so as to investigate the distribution and concentration Mo species. The doublet peaks associated with the Mo species have a splitting of ∼3.15 eV, and deconvolution was adopted to estimate the distribution and concentration Mo species, the Mo 3d5/2 to Mo 3d3/2 ratio was obtained as 3:2 [31]. As shown in Fig. 2a, there exists three molybdenum species in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample. Among the three molybdenum species, the 228.07 eV of 3d5/2 binding energy is due to the Mo2+ species involved in the MoC bonding [5]. In addition, the Mo 3d5/2 binding energies of 231.87 and 232.58 eV were identified as Mo4+ and Mo6+, respectively. However, the surface Mo content of Mo2+ species is clearly much smaller than that of Mo4+and Mo6+, indicating that Mo2C has a smaller ratio in total Mo species. Our speculation with respect to the surface Mo2C is that they will likely be oxidized partly after exposure to air. Besides, MoO3 peak was not observed throughout our XRD analysis ( Fig. 1a). Therefore, the presence of the MoO3 should be attributed to the surface air oxidation, which agrees with the result reported by others [32]. In order to verify the influence of air on the valence state of the Mo phase, the used catalysts were passivated. Fig. 2b clearly shows that the content of Mo2+ species of Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts after passivation is much greater than the counterpart that directly exposed to the air. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Mo2C surface can be oxidized partly after exposure to the air. According to the characteristic peaks shown in Fig. 2c, it is clear that the Mo 3d signal of Ni-Mo/MgO shows only two Mo 3d5/2 peaks, corresponding to Mo6+ and Mo4+species at ∼234.2 and 232.0 eV, respectively. Considering the XRD analysis of the catalyst without Mo2C peak (Fig. 1a), it is reasonable to deduce that Mo2C is difficult to form for the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst without β-CD addition. The surface existence of the Mo6+ species might be due to the oxidation of the low-valence Mo species. For Ni-Mo2C/MgO without pre-reduction, only two oxidation states for the surface Mo species were observed. It is possible that pre-reduction reaction for Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst cannot result in formation of Ni, reduction of dissociated CH4, or formation of Mo2C. From the XPS results, it is obtained that Ni interacts with the Mo2C species. In addition, the metallic Mo phase peak was not detected for all the catalysts. 3.2 Characterization of the used catalysts The SEM images of Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts after DRM reaction are displayed in Fig. 3 . Fig. 3a clearly shows that numerous carbon fiber exhibit in the spent Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst, however, such fibrous carbon were not observed for the spent Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst (Fig. 3b). The Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst is composed of spherical MgO and massive Mo2C, and Ni as small nanoparticles are highly dispersed. The particle size distributions from the SEM images revealed that the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample is composed of homogeneously distributed Ni NPs. The average Ni particle size is about 12.7 nm (Figure S3a). The distribution of main elements of these catalysts were further investigated via Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) (Figure S4). In Ni-Mo/MgO sample, the Ni species aggregate severely, proving nickel sintering in the sample (Figure S4a). Compared to the Ni-Mo/MgO sample, the Ni species are dispersed better in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample. In addition, the Mo and C elements also respond well, proving the formation of bulk Mo2C in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample (Figure S4b). The representative TEM images of the Ni-Mo/MgO and Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. It is clear that Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst form two types of carbon deposits, whisker-like carbon tubes and shell-like encapsulating carbon[33] (Fig. 4a). However, both whisker-like carbon and shell-like encapsulating carbon were not observed on the surface of Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst (Fig. 4b). On the surface of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst, whisker carbon with an internal hollow channel is mainly formed [34]. Kroll and Frusteri reported that whisker-like carbon possesses no or little toxicity [33,35]. On the contrary, almost all the shell-like carbon deposits have high toxicity, possibly due to progressive encapsulation of the Ni particles, which results in hindered access of the reactant gas to the active surfaces. In addition, larger metal particles form encapsulating carbon easier than the smaller-sized counterparts. The particle sizes and distributions of Ni-Mo/MgO before and after the reaction were measured from the TEM and SEM images (Fig. 4b). The average Ni particle sizes of Ni-Mo/MgO before and after the reaction were 46.8 and 51.6 nm, respectively (Figure S3c and Figure S3d). The TEM images shows that Ni NPs appeared completely encapsulated by the shell-like carbon layers, which might account for the low catalytic activity of Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts. At higher resolution, details of these shell-like carbon layers associated with the Ni-Mo/MgO species are evident. The distance between the carbon layers was about 0.338 nm, close to that of graphite (i.e., 0.335 nm), indicating the graphite structure of these carbon layers [35]. According to the TEM images of the Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst, no or little carbon deposit was detected at the surface (Fig. 4b). However, some nano-sized Ni particles appeared on the surface. It also revealed that the catalyst composition changes, enabling modifications in the active phase's reactivity, thereby effectively influencing the carbon deposit structures and morphology [36]. The insets in Fig. 4b clearly show the crystal lattices of Mo2C (101), which prove the existence of Mo2C in the samples [37,38], which is in agreement with the XRD observations (Fig. 1). By directly measuring the particle sizes through the TEM imaging (Fig. 4b), one could determine the nanoparticle distributions in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO samples. As displayed in Figure S3b, the average size of the Ni particles is in the order of 15.2 nm, which agrees with the results obtained from the SEM images. When the TEM images of the Mo2C samples before and after the reaction were compared in Figure S5, it is clear that the surfaces associated with the Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst possess essentially no or little carbon deposit. To check the reducibility of Ni and MoOx species, we analyzed the H2-TPR of the Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst (Figure S6). In the temperature range of 200–800 °C, three distinct reduction peaks were observed. The first strong peak at 380 °C was attributed to the reduction of smaller NiO particles. In contrast, the peak at 488 °C was attributed to the reduction of much larger NiO particles in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst [39,40]. Regarding the reduction of MoOx, it is well understood that bulk MoO3 is reduced only at very high temperatures. Usually, MoO3 is reduced to MoO2 in the temperature range of 750–800 °C, however, no peaks in the temperature range of 750–800 °C were observed in Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst, only a peak at 544 °C was observed, which is likely due to the presence of nickel particles that caused enhanced reducibility of the molybdenum species [41]. The Raman spectra for the Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO samples are shown in Figure S7. These two samples both have intense bands at ∼1336 and ∼1600 cm−1, attributed to the carbon species tangential band (G-band) and disorder band (D-band), respectively [32,42]. This indicates that both the Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO catalysts have carbon species. For further confirmation of the existence of the carbon species in Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO samples, we conducted a TG-DSC test. Take 20 mg each of Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO for TG-DSC test. The TG-DSC curves for the Ni-Mo2C/MgO and Ni-Mo/MgO samples after the stability test are presented in Fig. 5 . As shown in Fig. 5, a small mass loss is observed before 200 °C, and the DSC curves also show an endothermic peak, attributed to free water evaporation [40,43]. The successive sharp mass losses are accompanied by an exothermic peak observed between 300 and 600 °C, which can be related to coke oxidation. Compared to the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample, we observe a greater mass loss for the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst (Fig. 5) to the extent of about 7 wt%, indicating Ni-Mo2C/MgO exhibit strong stability and resistance to carbon deposition. Subsequently, some gain in mass was detected above 600 °C, along with a weak exothermic peak, which is related to oxidation of Mo2C. Based on the TG-DSC and Raman's results, we can confirm that the carbon species in the Ni-Mo2C/MgO sample is related to Mo2C whereas the carbon content of the Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst is attributed to the carbon deposit. This result also suggests that Mo2C is not oxidized during the reaction. It is widely accepted that bigger Mo2C particles exhibit greater resistance to oxidation due to their lower reactivity. This is in agreement with the Raman results (Figure S7), EDX results (Figure S4b), as well as XRD Scherrer equation test. 3.3 Evaluation of catalytic performance Figure S8 presents the catalytic performances of dry reforming of biogas over Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts from 750 to 900 °C. Both the conversions of CH4 and CO2 progressively increase with the increase of temperature. Catalyst activity depends on Ni/Mo mass content. All the catalysts show high catalytic activity at 850 °C, and the 7Ni-15Mo2C/MgO sample offers a greater CH4 and CO2 conversion at 850 °C than other catalysts with different compositions. The time on-stream performance of Ni-Mo/MgO are shown in Fig. 6 . The conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 of Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst decline rapidly within 30 h, similar decline in the conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 were also observed on Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst without reduction, Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst maintains high activity and stability within 200 h during the stability test, the H2/CO ratio are shown in Fig.S9. Obviously, there is a synergistic effect Ni-Mo2C, which facilities the maintenance of the high activity and stability. 4 Conclusion Novel catalysts Ni-Mo2C/MgO, composed of Ni NPss with narrow size distribution, bulk Mo2C with oxidation resistance, and spherical MgO as support, were prepared, and further applied in dry reforming of biogas at atmospheric pressure. The Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst showed high catalytic stability and activity at a high WHSV of 30,000 cm3 g−1 h−1 throughout the test period of 200 h. Through optimization of the Mo and Ni content, it was found that Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst with Ni and Mo contents of 7 and 15 wt% display the best catalytic performance. When the Ni and Mo contents were in the ranges of 5–7 and 10–20 wt%, the precursors could be converted to Mo2C regardless of their Ni and Mo contents. Besides, it was found that β-CD could promote the Mo2C formation, and Ni also has particular interaction with Mo2C. Based on the test results, it is found that the Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalyst is a typical bi-functional catalyst for dry reforming of biogas. The role of CH4 dissociation on Ni, CO2 adsorption on MgO, and CO2 activation on Mo2C were also confirmed to some extent. One could match CO2 activation and CH4 dissociation through regulating the content of Ni and Mo2C, in order to promote catalytic oxidation–reduction cycle. Thus, the establishment of Ni-Mo2C carbonization-oxidation cycle represents a novel catalytic system, which shows great potential in thermal catalysis.

        "dc:description": "In this work, Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts were prepared by sol-gel method with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as the carbon source and dispersant, and applied in the dry reforming of biogas. The roles of ratio of Ni/Mo as well as β-CD on the catalytic activity and stability were analyzed. Systematic characterizations analysis such as XRD, XPS, and TEM confirm that Mo2C can only form under the condition of pre-reduction and carburization, confirming that metallic Ni nanoparticles promote the carbonization process of Mo2C, and that β-CD as a carbon source is of great necessity for the formation of Mo2C. In the dry reforming of biogas, the formation of Mo2C significantly impacts the catalytic activity and stability, which is beneficial for CO2 activation and coke removal via the redox cycle. Ni-Mo2C/MgO catalysts with optimized Ni and Mo contents of 7 and 15 wt%, respectively, exhibit the best catalytic activity and stability for the dry reforming of biogas. The CH4 and CO2 conversion rates remained above 90% and 85%, respectively, for 200 h at 850 °C and WHSV = 30,000 ml. g−1. h−1.",
