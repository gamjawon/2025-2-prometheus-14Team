Introduction Metal nanoparticles have a high surfaceâ€�toâ€�volume ratio and consequently a large fraction of the metal atoms is exposed to reactant molecules, which makes them promising catalysts in chemical synthesis [1,2]. However, the direct application of noble metal nanoparticles in catalysis is often difficult due to their very small size and high tendency toward agglomeration by van der Waals forces. Polymer matrixes can serve as the support for these materials for keeping the nanoparticles from aggregation, provide the desired interface between the nanoâ€� particles and the reaction media, and facilitate the synthesis and reuse of the catalysts. It has been extensively demonstrated that palladium nanoâ€� particles entrapped in a polymer matrix are good heterogeneâ€� ous catalysts for Cï€­C bond formation reactions. In particular, encouraging results were achieved in the crossâ€�coupling of arylboronic acids with aryl halides. The common used polymer matrixs were polystyrene [3,4], poly(amidoamine)â€�dendrimer [5,6], cyclodextrin [7], poly(Nâ€�vinylâ€�2â€�pyrrolidone) (PVP) [8ï€­10], polystyreneâ€�coâ€�poly[2â€�methacrylic acid] 3â€�bisâ€�(carboxymethylamino)â€�2â€�hydroxypropyl ester [11], poly(Nâ€�isopropylacrylamide), the waterâ€�compatible biopolyâ€� mer chitosan [12,13], ethylenediamineâ€�functionalized cellulose [14], polystyreneâ€�poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer, Amberlite IRA 900 [15], polyaniline nanofibers [16], aminomethylated TentaGel resin [17], merrifield resin [18], phosphanated coâ€� polymer [19], and the copolymer of styrene with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) [20]. In many cases, the polymerâ€�supported catalyst has extremely small and uniform Pd clusters, which were 1 nm [19], 1.4 Â± 0.4 nm [6], 2.0 nm [5], 2.3 Â± 0.3 nm [21], 3.8 nm [22], and 6 nm. [20]. The Suzuki reaction is perhaps the most powerful and verâ€� satile method for the formation of new biaryls [15,23ï€­29]. This * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 3, March 2013 MA Hengchang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 578â€“584 is due to the ease of the synthesis and handling and the wide functional group tolerance of aryl boronic acids as compared with Grignard reagents, and also the reactants have relatively low toxicity as compared with the aryl tin reagents. Recent publications have already focused on developing new catalysts for the Suzuki reaction using supported nanoparticle palladium [30ï€­34], but given the importance of the reaction, there is a need to investigate more suitable stabilizer materials and to address the questions of product isolation and catalyst recyclaâ€� bility. Our research in the field of biopolymerâ€�based materials prompted us to investigate the use of feather protein as a green support material for palladium nanoparticles [35]. Feather keratin is a natural polymer consisting of numerous amino acids units. Due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and ready availability, keratins are attracting growing interest as environmentally friendly substitutes for classical organic and inorganic supports [36ï€­41]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of feather keratinâ€�Pd nanoparticles The Pd nanoparticles were prepared by the process previâ€� ously described [34]. A 10 ml aqueous solution of PdCl2 (10 mg) and 1 g of feather keratin [42,43] were stirred at room temperature (25ï€­30 Â°C) until the color of the solution became transparent. After filtrating, the bright yellow solid was charged into 10 ml deionized water and an excess amount of sodium ascorbate (500 mg) was added. The mixture was vigâ€� orously stirred for 24 h until the color of the solid changed to dark brown, and then the filtrated solid was washed with deâ€� ionized water and ketone several times. The powder was dried in vacuo at 30 Â°C overnight (Pd content: 8.8%). 2.2.

General experimental procedure for Suzuki reaction In air, aryl halide (0.2 mmol), arylboronic acid (0.22 mmol), K2CO3 (0.3 mmol), 5 ml of distilled water, and 2 mg of catalyst were combined in a 10 ml round bottom flask. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred and the temperature was maintained at 75 Â°C in an oil bath. Reaction progress was monâ€� itored by TLC. After reaction was completed, the reaction mixâ€� ture was cooled to room temperature and filtrated. The filtratâ€� ed solid was washed with water (3ï€­5 ml) and dissolved with ethyl acetate. The catalyst was separated by filtration, washed with water, and dried in vacuum. The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was reâ€� moved under reduced pressure to give the product. 2.4. General recycling experimental procedure for Suzuki reaction In air, 5a (0.2 mmol, 37 mg), 1b (0.22 mmol, 26.8 mg), K2CO3 (0.3 mmol, 41.4 mg), 5 ml of distilled water, and 2 mg of catalyst were combined in a 10 ml round bottomed flask. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred and the temperature was maintained at 75 Â°C in an oil bath. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was extracted by ethyl acetate four times, then 5a (0.2 mmol, 37 mg), 1b (0.22 mmol, 26.8 mg), K2CO3 (0.3 mmol, 41.4 mg) were added into the aqueous phase for the next recycling experiment. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization by TEM and XRD The sample was a small drop of the colloidal dispersion deâ€� posited onto a piece of copper grid and then dried at room temperature under vacuum. The bioâ€�polymer chains consisted of a range of hydrophobic residues, which made the bioâ€�polymer a moderate to good stabilizer and template for the metal particles. After reduction of PdCl2 by sodium ascorbate in aqueous solution, a dark brown precipitate that was very stable for several months was obtained. The TEM images of the polyâ€� merâ€�Pd nanoparticles showed that the particles were quite well dispersed, and the mean diameter of the Pd particles was 3.9 nm (Fig. 1). Three strong diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ = 39.32Â°, 45.56Â°, and 66.82Â°, corresponding to the diffraction of the (111), (200), and (220) lattice planes of the face centered cubic crystalline structure of the Pd nanoparticles, were clearly seen in the XRD patterns of the feather keratinâ€�Pd catalyst [20, 44] (Fig. 2). 3.2. Suzuki crossâ€�coupling reactions Generally, the Suzuki reaction is performed in an organic solvent [45], or in a solvent mixture of water and a polar orâ€� ganic solvent such as N,Nâ€�dimethylformamide (DMF) [46], NMP (Nâ€�methylâ€�2â€�pyrrolidone) [44,47], or THF (tetrahydrofuran) [48] or in water with the addition of a surfactant, which helps in the solvation of the organic substrates and the inorganic base [49ï€­52]. However, these strategies usually involve tedious pufication and have low efficiency when a hydrophilic ligand is used or the Pd catalyst is immobilized on a hydrophilic support. The Suzuki reaction can be performed successfully in the solâ€� vent of just water [20]. It is known that hydrophobic interacâ€� tions have a significant influence on organic reactions, and many organic reactions often proceed with much higher rates in water than in organic solvents. The accelerating effect of water has been ascribed to a number of factors, including the hydrophobic effect as well as hydrogen bonding. In our reacâ€� tion protocols, the Suzuki reaction of 4â€�bromobenzaldehyde with phenylboronic acid was chosen to optimize the reaction conditions, and we found that the difference between nonhyâ€� drophobic and hydrophobic conditions was remarkable.

It is probable that in the solvent of water, hydrophobic surfaces benefit from the tendency of water to exclude nonpolar species and thus minimize the Gibbs energy of salvation [53,54]. On the other hand, when the feather keratinâ€�Pd nanopartiâ€� cles catalyst was used as a nanoreactor for the Suzuki reaction, it was necessary for the reagents to penetrate into the lattice of the polymer and gain access to the Pd catalyst to initiate the reaction. Here, hydrogen bonding possibly played the role that in an aqueous phase, the amino acid chains become stretched by preferential hydrogen bonding with water molecules, which increased the driving force for the hydrophobic guest moleâ€� cules to diffuse into the Pd nanoreactor by an extremely high concentration around the Pd nanoparticle. Therefore the Suzuâ€� ki reaction in the nanoreactor of Pdâ€�feather is expected to be efficient in water, but in the absence of water, the amino acid chains become contracted because of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between polypeptide chains, which prevent the Pd nanoreactor from being contacted by reactant molecules. Thus we envisioned that protic solvents used as hydrogen bonding donors have the potential to accelerate the Cï€­C formation reacâ€� tion. More than ten solvents were examined, and obviously, CH3OH, EtOH, and HOCH2CH2OH were tested to be beneficial reaction media. However, in the aprotic solvents of toluene and THF, the bioâ€�polymer blocked the passageway access of the reactant molecules to the Pd nanoreactor, and very low yields of coupling product were produced (Fig. 3). We concluded that the large different efficiencies of the halides were not only due to the Cï€­X bonding energy, which was in the order of I < Br < Cl, but can be also partly ascribed to the support structure and reaction conditions. It can be seen that the use of the feather protein stabilized Pd nanoparticles as the catalyst resulted in the dominant forâ€� mation of the crossâ€�coupling product. The desired products were almost completely precipitated from the aqueous phase after the cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature. Filtration of the heterogeneous mixture afforded a crude comâ€� pound with NMR purity.

Scope of the Suzuki reaction with the Pd nanoâ€�catalyst.Â MA Hengchang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 578â€“584 (0.22 mmol), K2CO3 (0.3 mmol), and 2 mg of Pd catalyst (0.55 mol%) stirred in 5 ml water at 75 Â°C under atmosphere condiâ€� tions. To explore the scope of the Pd nanoparticles as a catalyst for the Suzuki reactions, the reactions of several typical hydroâ€� philic and hydrophobic aryl halides with benzeneboronic acid were carried out in water at 75 Â°C. As shown in Scheme 1, the more hydrophilic substrates such as 4â€�bromophenol, 4â€�bromobenzaldehyde, 4â€�bromobenzenamine can be enâ€� trapped in the nanoenvironment of the Pdâ€�feather keratin, and all these coupling reactions were quite efficient with yields of biaryls higher than 90% at 75 Â°C in 5 h. As expected, the Suzuki reactions of hydrophobic aryl halides with benzeneboronic acid were relatively unsatisfactory and longer reaction times were required. For instance, the coupling reaction of 1â€�bromoâ€�4â€�methylbenzene with benzeneboronic acids only afforded 3c (11 h, 87% yield), 13c (12 h, 82%), and 24c (10 h, 78%) in moderate yields. It is documented that the mass transfer rates of the aryl halides and the resultant biaryls between the nanoreactor of Pd catalyst and the solvent of water also play a very important role [55]. When a hydrophilic aryl halide is used, the hydrophilic aryl halide is entrapped in the nanoreactor until the mass disâ€� tribution equilibrium between the nanoreactor and the solvent of water is reached. The resulting hydrophilic biaryl can easily diffuse through the nanoreactor into the solvent to reach mass distribution equilibrium, but this is much more difficult for hydrophobic substrates and for the resultant hydrophobic biaryls to diffuse from the nanoreactor into the water. The enâ€� riched high concentration of the hydrophobic biaryls in the nanoreactor therefore slows down the Suzuki reaction. To conâ€� firm this, competitive Suzuki reactions of a binary mixture of hydrophobic 4â€�bromoanisole and hydrophilic 4â€�bromophenol (1:1 by mole number) in the Pd nanoreactor in water was studied. It was found that the competitive reactions afforded 4â€�hydroxybiphenyl with >99% selectivity and 78% isolated yield at 75 Â°C in 2 h. Similar results were also obtained in the arylation of 4â€�bromobenzaldehyde and 1â€�bromoâ€� 4â€�methylbenzene. Interestingly, the parallel arylation of the more active 4â€�iodophenol and the less active 4â€�bromophenol at the same reaction conditions produced 3c with almost no difâ€� ference in isolated yields.

In addition, the recyclability of the catalyst was studied in the coupling reaction using the formation of 5c at 75 Â°C with 0.55 mol% Pd. Completion of the reaction was accomplished after 5 h in the first three runs. The activity dropped slightly after the fourth run (Fig. 4). This result probably cannot be explained by leaching during the reaction as the Pd amount in the reaction mixture after three runs was very low, and was 0.0001%. The activity in the recycling experiments strongly depended on the recycling procedure. The results described above were obtained when extraction was used to separate the water solution of the catalyst from the reaction mixture. Thus, much catalyst loss was inevitable. On the other hand, the ionic strength of the solution was increased upon the addition of the inorganic salt of potassium carbonate, which resulted in the weak adhesion of Pd particles on the feather keratin stabilizer. Therefore, Pd nanoparticles were precipitated out of the soluâ€� tion. 4. Conclusions The immobilization of Pd(0) on the biopolymerâ€�based maâ€� terial, feather keratin, by chemical coordination and subseâ€� quent chemical reduction gave Pd nanoparticles. The Pd nanoâ€� particle catalyst was successfully used in Suzukiâ€�Miyaura couâ€� pling reactions. This catalyst is readily available and easy to handle as it is stable in air. Its high activity and very low leachâ€� ing makes it an attractive alternative to commercial Pd cataâ€� lysts such as Pd on charcoal.
