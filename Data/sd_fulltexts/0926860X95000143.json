Activity of catalysts in parallel HDN of pyridine and HDS of thiophene was compared with activity of a commercial NiMoP/ alumina catalyst. Catalysts prepared from silica-ceria have higher HDS and HDN activities, produce a significantly lower amount of intermediate piperidine and possess the HDN/HDS selectivity com- parable with the alumina supported catalyst. These properties can be ascribed both to the specific properties of support and phosphorus. Deposition of MoO3 was accompanied by consumption of OH groups of silica-ceria support; it was found that phosphorus facilitates significantly this reaction. The higher consumption of OH groups was in relation with increased activity of NiMoP catalysts; we suppose this behaviour is connected with a higher dispersion of the Mo phase.

Introduction The majority of hydrorefining CoMo or NiMo sulfide catalysts is produced using alumina support. These catalysts, designed mostly for sulfur removal, have been used for a long time in refineries and they were optimalized respecting the requi- rements of the HDS process. At present, increasing demands on the quality of petroleum products and the need to process heavier fractions containing a larger amount of nitrogen compounds call for new catalysts possessing better activity and improved selectivity [ 1,2]. One approach to solve this problem consists in a sub- * Corresponding author. Fax ( + 42-2) 342073. 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

The alternative supports often studied include active carbon, metal oxides, zeolites and mixed metal oxides {3-6]. Promising results have recently been obtained with NiMo catalysts using the mixed metal oxides as supports; they have often a better HDN activity and HDN/HDS selectivity as compared to alumina supported counterparts {7,8]. During our study of different catalytic supports, we observed recently that ceria- supported Mo sulfide displayed roughly a twofold pyridine consumption as com- pared to thiophene HDS [9]. However, the activity was by one order of magnitude lower due to small surface area of support. We attempted to prepare a high surface area support with ceria well dispersed in a rather inert matrix; we supposed to obtain a catalyst with increased activity keeping the selectivity features of ceria. The second component chosen was silica; the mixed silica-ceria carrier with sufficient mechanical strength and macroporous structure was prepared by coprecipitation. The aim of the present work was to test the silica-ceria material as alternative support for the NiMo (P) sulfide catalysts; different procedures concerning molyb- denum and phosphorus deposition were chosen during preparation of catalysts. Phosphorus was added to the catalysts in order to avoid the precipitation of impreg- nating solution during coimpregnation and to have samples comparable with the commercial phosphorus containing catalyst. Properties of the prepared catalysts were compared with the hydrorefining NiMoP/alumina catalyst Shell 324 chosen as a standard. The test reaction was a parallel HDN/HDS reaction of pyridine and thiophene at 320 and 20 bar of pressure. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Mixed silica-ceria support (SC) was prepared by adding a solution of 40 g sodium silicate in 0.8 1 distilled water to 0.5 1 aqueous solution containing 69 g cerium nitrate hexahydrate. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with 20 1 distilled water. Product was dried at 120 for 6 h, calcined at 520 for 2 h, grinded and sieved to the fraction 0.18-0.35 ram. Pore size distributions were measured both by mercury porosimetry on a Micromeritics Auto-Pore 9200 instrument and by nitrogen adsorption on a Micromeritics Digisorb 2600 instrument. X-ray dif- fraction of support was performed on the Dron-2.0 instrument. The residual sodium content was determined by AAS after dissolution of support in hydrofluoric acid. The acid strength was tested qualitatively by toluene solution of dicinnamalacetone [10]. Catalysts were prepared by mixing the support with aqueous solutions of pre- cursors at room temperature for 0.5 h in a rotary evaporator and by subsequent water removal under vacuum at 60. The volume of solution did not exceed the volume of support by 20%. Catalyst A, denoted as ( - ,Mo,Ni/SC), was prepared D. Gulkovd, Z. VO /Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 61 70 63 by subsequent impregnations of support with solutions of ammonium heptamolyb- date (AHM) and nickel nitrate with drying at 130 between both steps. Catalyst B (P,Mo,Ni / SC), was prepared by the same procedure, but the support was impreg- nated firstly with phosphoric acid and calcined at 400 for 1 h. Catalyst C (P + Mo,Ni/SC), was prepared by coimpregnation of AHM and phosphoric acid in the first step; after drying at 130 it was impregnated by nickel nitrate solution. Catalyst D (P + Mo + Ni/SC), was prepared by one step coimpregnation using solution of AHM, nickel nitrate and phosphoric acid. Catalysts A and D contained 15.6 wt.-% MoO3 and 2.4 wt.-% NiO. In addition, samples B and D contained 6.0 wt.-% P205. The commercial NiMoP/alumina catalyst Shell 324 contains 19.4 wt.- % MOO3, 3.5 wt.-% NiO and 6.9 wt.-% P205 [ 11 ]. All catalysts contained small quantities of sodium, the commercial catalyst about 0.1 wt.-% Na20 [ 11 ] and the catalysts prepared from silica-ceria less than 0.03 wt.-% Na20, respectively. Prior to the tests, catalysts were sulfided by mixture of 10% HzS in hydrogen starting from room temperature to 400 (6/rain) and then at 400 for 1 h. In order to get more information between phosphorus-MoO3-support interaction, small amounts of supports modified by phosphorus, molybdenum or by phosphorus and molybdenum together were put aside before nickel deposition. These samples were calcined in air at 450 for 1 h instead of sulfidation. Surface concentrations of OH groups were determined by pulse-flow method using dimethyl-zinc tetrah- ydrofuranate (DMZ) as reagent [ 12]. Commercial samples of ceria having a BET surface area 120 m2/g was used as standard. FT-IR spectra were recorded on Nicolet MX- 1E instrument with resolution of 2 cm - 1 using thin wafers ( 7 mg/ cm2) placed in a cell permitting in situ treatment. The samples were degassed at 400 in vacuum before recording the spectra. 2.2. Catalytic tests Parallel HDN/HDS reaction of pyridine and thiophene was carried out in an integral flow reactor with a fixed bed at 320 and overall pressure of 20 bar, as was described in detail earlier [ 13]. The feed contained 220 mole ppm of pyridine and 240 mole ppm of thiophene in hydrogen. The hydrogen flow rate was 0.4 tool/ h and the catalyst weight varied from 0.03 to 0.1 g in order to keep conversions between 20 and 85%. Activity of catalysts was evaluated by simple kinetics and characterised by pseudo first-order rate constants for thiophene conversion to Ca hydrocarbons, k(TH), for pyridine hydrogenation to piperidine, k(PY), and for piperidine hydrogenolysis to C5 hydrocarbons, k(C5), all values related to mol of molybdenum [ 13 ]. The factor expressing the C-N bond hydrogenolytic efficiency was defined by the ratio of the rate constants k(C5)/k(PY). The selectivity between HDN and HDS reactions, S(HDN/HDS), was defined as the conversion of pyridine to C5 hydrocarbons at 80% conversion of thiophene. 64 D.

Results and discussion 3.1. Properties of support Silica-ceria mixed oxide is a yellow solid having a BET surface area of 252 m2/ g and a good crushing strength to be used as catalyst support. Chemical analysis corresponds to 60% SiO2 and 40% CeO2; the residual sodium content was 0.035 wt.-% Na20. No crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction showing the solid is amorphous. Results of nitrogen adsorption measurements and mercury porosimetry are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Pore size distribution of silica-ceria possesses a distinctly bimodal character. Large pores of diameter about 30 nm are visible by the both methods and moreover, the nitrogen adsorption reveals the presence of mesopores having diameter about 6 nm. Texture of silica-ceria substantially differs from that for y-alumina where typical pore diameters approach 8-10 nm. Apparent 0,5 0,4 \"1o > \"a 0,3 0,2 o,1 o,o 10 100 r (nm) Fig. 2.

Concentration of residual OH groups on ceria (, silica-ceria ((1) and silica (e) as a function of temperature of pretreatment. Data for the silica support taken from ref. [ 12 ]. density of the solid phase was found 1.88 g/cm3 and the pore volume, determined by mercury porosimetry, was about 0.75 cm3/g. Comparison of surface densities of OH groups of silica-ceria support with pure ceria and silica pretreated at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 3. It is clearly seen, that the OH population of the mixed support is lower than that of ceria but higher as compared to silica. It is interesting, that the experimental values found for the mixed support correspond almost exactly to the values calculated from the bulk composition and densities of OH groups of pure components. It seems there- fore that both oxides are distributed homogeneously in the mixed phase and the surface composition corresponds to the bulk. This conclusion is supported by recent observation that ceria is well dispersed in silica without silicate formation when a mixture of both oxides is calcined up to 600 [ 14]. In contrast to pure silica or ceria, the mixed support possesses strong acid sites corresponding to Ho value lower than - 3. Generation of strong acidity in the mixed oxide phase is well known [ 10]. In our case, when the OH groups were removed by reaction with organometallic reagent (DMZ), strong acidity disappeared con- firming the character of the Br6nsted type. Strong acid hydroxyls are generated probably by weakening of the O-H bond by interaction with the neighbouring cerium cation and constitute obviously only a smaller part from overall amount of OH groups. The FT-IR spectrum of silica-ceria, shown in Fig. 4, consists only of a single band located at 3746 cm l corresponding to vibrations of OH groups, similarly as in the cases of amorphous silica-alumina and silica [ 15,16]. It is well established fact that surface OH groups play an important role as the adsorption sites during AHM deposition and their amount controls the extent of this interaction [ 17-19]. From this point of view, the sorption properties of silica- ceria can be considered as lower in comparison to ceria due to a lower population of OH groups, but substantially better with respect to pure silica. 3.2. Phosphorus-MoOTsupport interaction Information concerning interaction between silica-ceria, molybdena and phos- phoric acid was obtained by surface area measurements, quantitative determinations 66 D.

Data in Table 1 show the surface areas and OH groups densities of support modified either by different loadings of phos- phorus ( up to 6.8% P205) or by different loadings of MoO3 (up to 16%). Moreover, the last two columns correspond to the support modified by constant amount of phosphorus and MOO3, deposited under conditions simulating the preparation of catalysts B and C, i.e. after consecutive impregnation by phosphoric acid and AHM and after coimpregnation by the both components, respectively. In this connection, it must be noted that the OH groups determination by chemical method was limited only to the support modified by phosphorus and molybdena, because in the presence of nickel oxide some side reactions of DMZ were observed. Deposition of 6.8% P205 or 16% MoO3 diminished the surface area of silica- ceria up to 68 and 62% of original value, respectively. Similar values were obtained for the support after deposition of both components. The values are very near to those for alumina supported catalyst in the oxidic state, having BET surface area Table 1 Surface area and residual density of OH groups of silica-cefia support after deposition of phosphorus and MoO3 Support Loading (wt.-%) Surface area (m2/g) OH density (No/nme) P2Os MoO3 SC - - 252 3.2 P/SC 3.4 - 261 3.0 P/SC 6.8 - 171 4.7 Mo/SC - 6.1 228 3.3 Mo/SC - 12.1 219 2.7 Mo/SC\" 16.0 155 2.5 P,Mo/SCa 5.7 16.0 146 2.3 P + Mo/SC\" 6.8 16.0 169 1.9 Pretreatment: 300/l h in He. \"Precursors for the catalysts A, B and C. D, Gulkovd, Z V[t /Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995)61-70 67 between 150 and 160 m~-/g [11]. Depositions of phosphorus or (and) MoO3 on silica-ceria is accompanied by partial decrease of surface area, analogously as for alumina supported catalysts. In this connection, it is interesting to compare the pore structures of the final sulfided NiMoP catalyst with that of the commercial one. While most pores of the Shell catalyst are concentrated in the region 8-10 nm [ 11 ], deposition of phosphorus with both active components on silica-ceria removed completely the mesopores with a diameter below 6 nm, so only macroporosity about 30 nm was preserved (Fig. l ). Modification of support with 3.4% P205 did not change the overall concentration of OH groups (Table 1 ). The higher phosphorus loading led to a higher density of OH groups which we explain by the presence of hydrogen containing species like HzPO4 or HPO4- [ 20,21 ] or by the free phosphoric acid. On the other hand, increasing deposition of MoO3 (up to 16%) decreased the OH density gradually up to 78% of original value (Table 1). This result was confirmed by a lower absorbance of the band corresponding to O-H vibrations in the IR spectrum (Fig. 4), being clear evidence for surface reaction of AHM with support, similarly as it was reported during the deposition of MoO3 on alumina [ 17,19]. In the presence of phosphorus, deposition of the same amount of MoO3 led to considerably higher consumption of hydroxyls. When AHM was adsorbed on the partially phosphated surface, like in catalyst B, or when AHM and phosphoric acid were coadsorbed together, like in catalyst C, the residual OH density decreased even up to 71 and 59%, respectively. This result shows a larger extent of interaction caused by the better spreading of AHM on the surface of silica-ceria. This behaviour is analogous to that observed for alumina supported catalysts, where the higher consumption of OH groups during MoO3 deposition is explained by the higher dispersion of molybdenum phase [17,22]. Considering this analogy and the fact that phosphorus positively influences the molybdenum dispersion on alumina [ 23 ], we conclude that phosphorus has the same effect in the case of silica-ceria support. Moreover, the data suggest, that the relatively highest molybdenum dispersion was obtained by AHM and phosphoric acid coimpregnation, the lower by simple impregnation of AHM on the previously phosphated surface and the lowest by impregnation in the absence of phosphorus. 3.3. Activit3, and selectiviO, of the NiMoP sulfide catalysts One NiMo catalyst without phosphorus (A), and three other samples with phos- phorus (B, C, D), were prepared from silica-ceria support. Results of catalytic tests in a model reaction, parallel HDN of pyridine and HDS of thiophene, are summarized with the values for alumina supported catalyst in Table 2. Large differences in activity and relatively minor changes in surface areas were found within the group of catalysts compared. No correlation was found between both parameters, showing the properties of catalysts are not only related to the different surface areas, but also to the procedure of preparation. 68 D.

[ 111. Data collected in Table 2 permit to compare both the effect of phosphorus and support. From the point of view of phosphorus addition, it is seen that activity of catalyst prepared in the absence of it (sample A), was at least by 50% lower than activities of the other catalysts containing this promoter (samples B, C, D). In general, despite of the type of reaction and the way of catalyst preparation, the data show that the presence of phosphorus improved the activity of silica-ceria supported NiMo catalysts similarly, as was often observed in the case of alumina supported NiMo catalysts [ 23-25]. More specifically, the changes of activity in the individual reactions were substantially influenced by the way of phosphorus and molybdenum introduction. Coimpregnation of support with AHM and phosphoric acid led to catalyst with higher activities (sample C) than simple deposition of AHM on previously phosphated surface (sample B). On the other hand, coimpregnation including nickel (catalyst D), was found to be less convenient, very probably due to the interaction of nickel nitrate with support during the next catalyst treatment. The improvement of activity after phosphorus addition was relatively low in pyridine hydrogenation, higher in thiophene HDS and the most significant in C-N bond hydrogenolysis. All catalysts prepared in the presence of phosphorus dis- played a considerably higher value ofk(C5 )/k(PY), i.e. the much lower piperidine formation than the catalyst prepared without phosphorus. Improvement of the C- N bond hydrogenolytic activity by phosphorus was also often observed over alu- mina supported NiMo catalysts [ 24,25 ]. The same trend in HDS and HDN activity reflected in the selectivity between both reactions, the value S(HDN/HDS) changed only a little in the range 0.24-0.30, being very near to that found for alumina containing catalyst. Considering all these results, we incline to believe, that the main role of phos- phorus in silica-ceria supported catalysts consists in the improvement of molyb- denum dispersion. Namely, the results of quantitative OH groups determination after MoO3 deposition suggested, that the dispersion decreased from sample C to A and, at the same time, the activities of catalysts C, B and A followed the same trend. Our conclusion is supported by the recent studies concerning CoMo and D. Gulkovd, Z Vft / Applied Catalysis A: General 125 (1995) 61-70 69 NiMo/alumina catalysts. It was shown, that molybdenum dispersion controls the activities of these catalysts in HDS or HDN reactions, because it affects the amount of accessible edge and corner sites in the MoS2 structure, which after decoration with Co or Ni act as active sites [ 26,27]. Additional conclusions concerning the effect of support follow also from data in Table 2. Comparison between the alumina based catalyst and the phosphorus con- taining silica-ceria supported catalysts having similar surface areas, i.e. samples D and C, reveals, that the later are much more active than alumina supported catalyst. The best sample had approximately twofold HDS and more than three times higher C-N bond hydrogenolytic activity, respectively. It is not quite clear at present, which property of support plays the overwhelming role. We suppose that the different texture does not contribute substantially to the better activity under our test conditions. This effect could be rather expected when a heavy fraction will be used as the feed instead of simple model compounds with relatively small size of molecule. On the other hand, it is more probable, that the higher acidity of silica- ceria as compared to alumina could contribute to a certain extent to the increased activity, this effect was observed recently in thiophene HDS over zeolite supported Ni and Mo catalysts [28]. The second property of the mixed support which probably takes part, is the specific redox property of ceria, i.e. the ability to be partially reduced and through hydrogen transfer to influence the properties of deposited molybdenum phase. This was very likely the reason for a high reactivity of pyridine over ceria supported Mo catalysts observed by us recently [9]. Nevertheless, it appears, that these properties were more or less suppressed by interaction with silica, because the high selectivity was not observed using the mixed support. Besides selectivity, some new properties, f.e. development of strong acidity in the mixed support, suggest this type of inter- action and a partial loss of specific properties of ceria. 4. Conclusions Silica-ceria support had shown to be a suitable support for preparation of the NiMoP sulfide catalysts. The catalysts prepared from silica-ceria possess interest- ing features: higher activities, much higher C-N bond hydrogenolytic efficiency and macroporosity as compared to the alumina supported catalyst. We ascribe these properties both to the effect of support and phosphorus. We assume these properties as potentially interesting from an industrial point of view; macroporosity for treat- ment of heavier fractions and the higher C-N bond hydrogenolytic efficiency for the lower content of hydrogenated intermediates reflecting in a lower hydrogen consumption. 70 D.

New macroporous silica-ceria support was synthesised and tested in the preparation of NiMo(P) sulfide catalysts differing in the way of Mo and phosphorus introduction. Activity of catalysts in parallel HDN of pyridine and HDS of thiophene was compared with activity of a commerical NiMoP/alumina catalyst. Catalysts prepared from silica-ceria have higher HDS and HDN activities, produce a significantly lower amount of intermediate piperidine and possess the HDN/HDS selectivity comparable with the alumina supported catalyst. These properties can be ascribed both to the specific properties of support and phosphorus. Deposition of MoO3 was accompanied by consumption of OH groups of silica-ceria support; it was found that phosphorus facilitates significantly this raction. The higher consumption of OH groups was in relation with increased activity of NiMoP catalysts; we suppose this behaviour is connected with a higher dispersion of the Mo phase.
