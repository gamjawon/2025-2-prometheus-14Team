Graphical abstract The high-entropy sulfide NiCoCuTiVS x , designed and synthesized based on the Hume-Rothery rule, was applied as the sulfur cathode catalyst. The synergistic effect enables NiCoCuTiVS x to have strong affinity and enhanced catalytic ability for lithium polysulfides. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high energy density suffer from the soluble lithium polysulfide species. Traditional metal sulfides containing a single metal element used as electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries commonly have limited catalytic abilities to improve battery performance. Herein, based on the Hume-Rothery rule and solvothermal method, the high-entropy sulfide NiCoCuTiVS x derived from Co9S8 was designed and synthesized, to realize the combination of small local strain and excellent catalytic performance. With all five metal elements (Ni, Co, Cu, Ti, and V) capable of chemical interactions with soluble polysulfides, NiCoCuTiVS x exhibited strong chemical confinement of polysulfides and promoted fast kinetics for polysulfides conversion. Consequently, the S/NiCoCuTiVS x cathode can maintain a high discharge capacity of 968.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and its capacity retention is 1.3 times higher than that of S/Co9S8. The improved cycle stability can be attributed to the synergistic effect originating from the multiple metal elements, coupled with the reduced nucleation and activation barriers of Li2S. The present work opens a path to explore novel electrocatalyst materials based on high entropy materials for the achievement of advanced Li-S batteries. Keywords High-entropy sulfides Hume-Rothery rule Polysulfides adsorption Cycle stability Lithium-sulfur batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been widely regarded as a promising next generation energy storage device, owing to their high theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg−1), low cost, and relative abundance of raw materials [1–3]. However, the commercial application of Li-S batteries is still hampered by several obstinate issues. The solid-liquid-solid phase transitions of sulfur generate different forms of polysulfides, among which long-chain lithium polysulfides (Li2S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) are soluble in organic ether electrolytes [4]. Because of the concentration gradients and the electric field, the long-chain lithium polysulfides will diffuse between sulfur cathodes and lithium metal anodes, which is known as the shuttle effect [5–7]. When diffusing to the anode, the long-chain lithium polysulfides will be reduced to the insoluble short-chain polysulfides Li2S/Li2S2 by the lithium metal, leading to the sluggish redox kinetics and increasing the internal resistance of batteries due to the deposition of an insulating Li2S/Li2S2 layer [8–10]. These short-chain polysulfides are able to diffuse back to the cathode and then react with the sulfur, which diminishes the utilization of active materials (capacity) and the cycle stability of the batteries [11,12]. Applying metal sulfides to the sulfur cathode as the electrocatalysts is considered to be an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) [13–15]. Metal sulfides function as LiPSs anchors and facilitate the redox reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries [16]. The electropositive metal cations and electronegative S2−/S2 2− anions endow the metal atoms with a high valence electron density, which creates binding sites for absorbing soluble LiPSs. Additionally, the soft basic S2−/S2 2− anions contribute to a covalent character, thereby imparting metal sulfides with high electrical conductivity which is beneficial for the electrochemistry conversion [17]. It was proved that certain metal sulfides such as TiS2, VS2, and CoS2 exhibit great conductivity and reduced charge transfer resistance [18]. These three metal sulfides have low diffusion barriers and enhance lithium ion transportation, which accelerates the reaction between lithium and sulfur and improves the electrochemistry reaction kinetics. Moreover, Yuan et al. incorporated CoS2 into sulfur cathodes and verified that the interfaces between CoS2 and electrolyte function as strong adsorption and activation sites for polysulfides [19]. The application of CoS2 not only provides strongly coupled CoS2-polysulfides interaction but also accelerates the redox reaction of polysulfides. However, because of the complicated intermediates and the complex redox reactions in Li-S batteries, the catalytic activity of these simple-component metal sulfides is insufficient, leading to the limited performance improvement of the batteries [20–22]. Specifically, the catalytic activity of metal sulfides is highly associated with the metal cation centers [23,24]. High-entropy sulfides (HES), with tunable five or more principal cations, are attracting growing research interest as catalysts for energy storage and conversion [25–27]. For example, Theibault et al. demonstrated that the redox reaction of lithium polysulfides is effectively catalyzed by high entropy sulfide material Zn0.30Co0.31Cu0.19In0.13Ga0.06S [28]. Due to the more reduced metal centers, the high entropy sulfide exhibits superior catalytic activity than its parent compounds. Apart from that, Nguyen et al. suggested that FeNiCoCrMnS2 exhibited superior oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity [29]. The strong interaction between the multiple metals and the sulfur generates a higher oxidation state, which has a higher oxidative potential and boosts the catalytic activity and stability. In addition, the local distortions existing in high-entropy materials result in overlapping site-energy distributions so that they can promote site percolation, thereby facilitating the diffusion rate of lithium ion during discharge and charge [30]. Zhao et al. reported the high-entropy materials Cu4MnFeSnGeS8 anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries [31]. The uniformly dispersed cations can effectively hinder continuous agglomeration and ensure robust interfacial contact, then enabling highly reversible sodium storage. However, the existing identification of elements in high-entropy sulfides still relies on conventional trial-and-error approaches, lacking an effective strategy to simplify the screening process and guarantee an enhancement in catalytic performance. Herein, following the Hume-Rothery rule, we effectively designed and synthesized high-entropy sulfides NiCoCuTiVS x based on Co9S8, which combines small local strains with excellent catalytic performance. NiCoCuTiVS x was synthesized by simple one-step hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing treatment. When utilized as the cathode constituent, NiCoCuTiVS x can strongly anchor soluble LiPSs and effectively promote the catalytic redox process of active species (Fig. 1 ). As a result, due to the reduced nucleation and activation barriers of Li2S, the S/NiCoCuTiVS x cathode delivers high capacity retention of 78.1% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, which is 1.3 times higher than that of S/Co9S8, and coupled with excellent rate capability. This research validates the potential of high entropy sulfides for realizing the advanced Li-S batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Typically, a mixture of NiCl2·6H2O (0.8 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (0.8 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.8 mmol), C16H36O4Ti (0.8 mmol), and NH4VO3 (0.8 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to get homogenous solution under continuous magnetic stirring. At the same time, 10 mmol thiourea was added to 30 mL DMF and stirred constantly. The two solutions were mixed and transferred to a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene liner to react at 180 °C for 16 h. The solid powder was collected by centrifugation. Subsequently, the high entropy sulfide NiCoCuTiVS x could be obtained after annealing at 450 °C for 2 h under flowing Ar gas. In order to further illustrate the advantages of NiCoCuTiVS x in lithium-sulfur batteries, Co9S8 was also synthesized via the same procedure. 2.2 Materials characterization The crystalline structures of the obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X’Pert) with Cu K α radiation over the range of 10°–60° (2θ). Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns were conducted using the GSAS software. The surface chemical valences and composition of the materials were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Al K α). The binding energy was corrected with the C 1s signal (248.8 eV). The morphologies of the obtained materials were characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55 Sapphire), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out to analyze the elements distributions. The microstructure was further investigated with FEI TECNAIG2 F30 transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2.3 Electrochemical evaluation The sulfur composite was firstly synthesized by combining the sulfur (70 wt%) with the as-prepared materials (NiCoCuTiVS x or Co9S8) (10 wt%) and Ketjen Black (20 wt%) by heat treatment at 155 °C for 12 h. Following that, the sulfur composite (80 wt%) was mixed with Super P (10 wt%) and polyvinylidene difluoride binder (10 wt%) dissolving in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was uniformly coated on the Al foil and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum. Finally, the dried electrodes were cut into round sheets with a diameter of 12 mm for battery assembly. The areal sulfur loading of the cathode was about 1.2–1.5 mg cm−2 while the corresponding electrolyte to sulfur ratio was 15 mL g−1. As for the high areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm−2, the electrolyte to sulfur ratio was 5 mL g−1. The thickness of lithium anodes was approximately 0.5 mm. CR2025 coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox, using the above sulfur cathodes, lithium metal anode, and Celgard membrane as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in a mixture solvent of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 in volume) with 1% LiNO3 as the additive. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed between 1.7 and 2.6 V using the Neware battery test system (CT-4008T). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out using the electrochemical station (CHI 760e) at various scanning rate. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was performed at 0.1 C discharge/charge for 10 min followed by a 120 min relaxation time between 1.7 and 2.6 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested on an electrochemical station within the frequency region from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Design and synthesis of HES The HES is designed based on the Co9S8 which has an excellent catalytic effect on the redox reaction of Li-S batteries [19]. In order to produce HES, at least five mutually compatible elements need to be reasonably designed. According to the Hume-Rothery principle, a small local strain is beneficial for single-phase stabilization, which depends on the cations-sulfur bond length. To make a comparison, the crystal structure information (CIFs) was used to analyze the cations-sulfur bond lengths in metal sulfides containing both Co and S. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), Ni and Cu show a large variation in the cations-sulfur bond lengths. Consequently, these cations can be introduced as “soft” ions to reduce local strain energy [32,33]. For selecting other cations, close positions in the periodic table and smaller differences in ionic radius and electronegativity are considered (Fig. S1). Transition metal atoms with electronegativity and ionic radius similar to those of Ni, Co, and Cu contribute to the stabilization of the formation of a single-phase structure. Additionally, it is reported that TiS2 and VS2 are the materials with good electrical conductivities [18]. Compared to other metal sulfides, they also demonstrate a stronger interaction with polysulfides and a lower decomposition barrier for Li2S. Based on the above, NiCoCuTiVS x is a favorable choice as HES with small local strain and excellent catalytic performance for Li-S batteries. The high-entropy sulfides NiCoCuTiVS x (denoted as NCCTVS) are synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method and followed by a high-temperature annealing process, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The XRD results of NCCTVS exhibit two typical peaks at 29.8° and 52.1°, corresponding to the (3 1 1) and (4 4 0) planes of metallic sulfide Co9S8 with face-centered (fcc) structure (PDF#65-6801). Meanwhile, the main peak which is located at 29.8° of NCCTVS slightly shifts to a lower angle due to the embedment of Ni, Cu, Ti, and V atoms in the lattice of metallic Co. The Rietveld refinements of XRD patterns reveal that NCCTVS exhibits a larger crystal lattice constant compared to Co9S8 (Table S1). Accordingly, the unit cell volume of NCCTVS (249.715 Å3) is larger than that of Co9S8 (244.336 Å3), which is ascribed to the increase in interplanar spacing. The morphology of NCCTVS was characterized using SEM. The NCCTVS was composed of spherical aggregates with a diameter of approximately 1 μm and discretely distributed nearly equiaxed particles (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2). The element surface distribution map results show that the Ni, Co, Cu, Ti, V, and S elements were uniformly distributed in NCCTVS (Fig. 2e–i and Fig. S3). The morphology and element distribution of Co9S8 are shown in Figs. S4 and S5. Based on the atomic percentage in NCCTVS (Table S2), the configurational entropy was calculated through Eq. (S1) and listed in Table S3. The configurational entropy of NCCTVS is higher than 1.5R, which can be considered as high entropy materials [34]. The TEM image further validated the high crystallinity of NCCTVS. Moreover, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) showcases the well-defined lattice fringes, with the d-spacing value of 0.572 nm consistent with that of the (111) lattice plane. Meanwhile, fast Fourier transform (FFT) shows that the NCCTVS crystallizes into the cubic Fm 3 ¯ m space group, which agrees with the XRD results. 3.2 Adsorption of LiPSs on NCCTVS To investigate the adsorptive properties of NCCTVS to LiPSs, the adsorption test was conducted by dispersing the equal weights of NCCTVS and Co9S8 materials into Li2S6 solution and resting for 5 h. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra (Fig. 3 a) show that the peak intensity of S6 2− decreased the most in the solution after adsorbing Li2S6 by NCCTVS. The Beer-Lambert law can be used to estimate the concentration of Li2S6 solution after adsorption, and the concentration of Li2S6 can be calculated through Eq. (S2) [35]. It can be known that the Li2S6 concentration after adsorption by NCCTVS decreased by 19.5%, which exceeded that of the solution adsorbed by Co9S8 (8.3%). The color change of the solution further confirms the superior absorption capability of NCCTVS for LiPSs (inset in Fig. 3a). The solution containing NCCTVS approached a nearly colorless state after adsorbing Li2S6. However, the control group with Co9S8 continued to exhibit a certain amount of Li2S6 color. Additionally, the interaction mechanism was investigated by XPS of NCCTVS before and after adsorbing Li2S6. Fig. 3(b) shows the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum with the Ni3+/Ni2+ couple at 855.1 and 852.4 eV, respectively. Upon adsorbing Li2S6, it can be observed that the fraction of Ni3+ decreased from 80.6% to 56.7%. Meanwhile, the peaks shift towards lower binding energy, which is caused by the electron transfer from Li2S6 [36]. Likewise, the Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c) also shows that the peak of Ti4+ shifts 0.38 eV to lower binding energy. The similar shifts can be also observed in the high resolution of Co 2p, Cu 2p, and V 2p spectra (Fig. S6). These results indicate that there exists robust chemical interaction between cations and LiPSs, which contributes to prohibiting the shuttle effect. Accordingly, the synergistic effect of multi-metal cations endows NCCTVS with abundant adsorption sites on the surfaces, thus promoting the effective adsorption of LiPSs [37]. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the two characteristic peaks at 161.1 and 162.1 eV in the S 2p spectrum are attributed to S2− and S2 2−, indicating the existence of metal sulfides [25]. In addition, with the adsorption of Li2S6, the peak at 164.1 eV in the S 2p spectrum corresponds to the bridging sulfur (SB 0) in Li2S6, which proves that Li2S6 is absorbed successfully. This can be further confirmed by the Cu–S bond appearing both in the Cu 2p XPS spectra after adsorption. The peak located at 160.4 eV in the S 2p spectrum is likely to be associated with the interaction between low-valent metal cations and S2−. By comparing the deviation in the binding energy of each element before and after adsorption (Fig. 3e), it can be found that the Co3+ has the greatest shift to lower binding energy, while the Ti4+ element has the minimal shift, indicating that the Co3+ is more effective in anchoring LiPSs among metals in the NCCTVS. The chemical interaction occurring on the NCCTVS is conducive to adsorbing LiPSs and subsequently facilitating their conversion, ultimately resulting in a remarkable enhancement in the cycle stability of sulfur cathodes. 3.3 Electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathodes To testify the functionality of NCCTVS on Li-S batteries, the electrochemical performance of the S/NCCTVS, S/Co9S8, and S was tested. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in N2 was performed to estimate the sulfur content in the sulfur composites (Fig. S7). The constant current charge-discharge curves of different cathodes (Fig. 4 a) were recorded at 0.1 C. Compared with the S/Co9S8 and S cathodes, the S/NCCTVS cathode demonstrates a higher initial discharge specific capacity of 1366.9 mA h g−1. Two discharge plateaus are observed for all three batteries and can be associated with the transformation from solid S8 molecules to the long-chain Li2S x (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) and further reduction to short-chain Li2S2 and Li2S, respectively. Furthermore, the higher potential gap between the discharge plateau and the charge plateau is related to the sluggish reaction of liquid-solid transformation and vice versa [38,39]. The polarization potential gap of the S/NCCTVS cathode (0.18 V) is significantly lower than that of S/Co9S8 (0.22 V) and S (0.34 V), reflecting its enhanced redox kinetics of NCCTVS. The long-term cycling performance of different cathodes at a current density of 0.5 C further verifies the outstanding performance of the S/NCCTVS cathode (Fig. 4b). It can still retain a high capacity of 968.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, which is far superior to that of the S/Co9S8 (558.9 mA h g−1) and S (340.7 mA h g−1). Among them, the coulombic efficiency of the S/Co9S8 and S battery is always greater than 100% throughout the cycles due to the sluggish charging reaction kinetics. In comparison, the coulombic efficiency of the S/NCCTVS battery is maintained at around 99.8%, indicating that NCCTVS enables batteries to have more rapid discharge-charge reaction kinetics [40]. Even under a higher current density of 1 C (Fig. 4e), the S/NCCTVS cathode still delivers an excellent initial specific capacity of 1120.8 mA h g−1. The high specific capacity of 725.4 mA h g−1 can be kept after 230 cycles, which reflects the strong chemical absorption of LiPSs and the suppressed shuttle effect. Even with the high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm−2) and the low electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio (5 mL g−1), the S/NCCTVS cathode can offer the discharge capacity of 638.8 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 50 cycles (Fig. S8), demonstrating that NiCoCuTiVS x can propel the conversion of LiPSs under the high sulfur loading. In addition, the rate performances under various current densities ranging from 0.1 to 2 C are measured (Fig. 4c). It can be found obviously that the S/NCCTVS exhibits enhanced rate performance, and the corresponding reversible capacities are 1256.3, 966.1, 845.9, 726.4, and 560.2 mA h g−1, respectively. Notably, when the current density is returned back to 0.1 C, the S/NCCTVS cathode can still exhibit a high capacity of 905.8 mA h g−1, implying better electrochemical reversibility and stability. Besides the discharge capacity, the overpotential of three cathodes was also examined by comparing the charge-discharge curves at various rates (Fig. S9). Typically, as the oxidation and reduction reactions proceed at a slower pace, the batteries show more severe polarization under higher current densities [41]. As shown in Fig. 4(d), at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C, the overpotential of S/NCCTVS is 0.14, 0.17, 0.19, and 0.31 V, respectively, which is lower than that of S/Co9S8 and S cathodes. The above results demonstrate that NCCTVS can effectively accelerate the kinetics of LiPSs conversion and reduce the irreversible sulfur loss. To further understand the interfacial electrochemistry of different cathodes, the EIS measurement for the batteries before and after 50 cycles at 1 C was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4(f) and Fig. S10, the charge-transfer resistance (R ct) of S/NCCTVS kept the lowest among the three cathodes before and after cycling, indicating that the addition of high-entropy sulfides enhances the electron transport and the catalyzed conversion reaction on electrode surface [42]. Fig. 4(g and h) illustrates the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis of corresponding EIS measurements. Peak P1 which lies on the high time constant is usually assigned to the diffusion process impedance in the electrode. Moreover, peak P2 and peak P3 which lie on the low time constants are associated with the cathode charge transfer impedance [43]. It can be observed obviously that S/NCCTVS exhibits the lowest ion diffusion and electron transfer impedance, which is attributed to the high conductivity of NCCTVS. 3.4 Electrochemical kinetics of the sulfur cathodes Fig. 5 (a) shows the CV curves of S/NCCTVS, S/Co9S8, and S cathode within the potential window of 1.7–2.6 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. It can be seen that there are two cathodic reduction peaks (Peak Ⅰ and Peak Ⅱ) and one anodic oxidation peak (Peak Ⅲ) among all the cathodes, which is related to the multistep reduction process from S to Li2S/Li2S2 and the reverse process. The CV curve of the S/NCCTVS cathode exhibits an evidently positive shift in reduction peaks and a negative shift in oxidation peak when compared to the other cathodes, suggesting a decrease in the polarization degree and a faster reaction kinetics [44]. To explore the diffusion coefficient of Li+ which is another key descriptor affecting battery performance, CV curves at various scan rates from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s−1 were recorded (Fig. 5b and Fig. S11). As the scan rate increases, the shapes of redox peaks of S/NCCTVS remain similar, revealing good electrochemical stability. It is well known that the Randles-Sevick equation can be used to reckon the diffusion coefficient of Li+ (Eq. (S3)). Generally speaking, the slope of the plot (I p-v 0.5) is positively correlated with the diffusion rate of Li+ [45]. The fitted line plot in Fig. 5(c) illustrates the oxidation conversion of Li2S/Li2S2 to S. The S/NCCTVS cathode always obtains a higher slope in both the oxidation and reduction process (Fig. S11), which suggests its faster ion diffusion in the redox reaction processes. The improved diffusion behavior verifies the more efficient lithium polysulfides conversion by high-entropy sulfides. To deeply understand the electrochemical process of batteries with different cathodes, the GITT curves are tested at 0.1 C. The dip depth in both discharging and charging profiles can serve as an indicator of the internal resistance associated with Li2S nucleation and Li2S activation, respectively (Fig. 5d–f) [46]. As shown in Fig. 5(g), the nucleation and activation barriers for Li2S were reduced to 42.3 and 156.6 mV. It means that NCCTVS contributes to alleviating polarization and kinetic limitations, and then improves the cycle stability of batteries. The reaction resistances at different normalized capacities are evaluated from the difference in potential at the end of the current step (QOCV) and that of the relaxation step (OCV) shown in Fig. S12. It is evident that the reaction resistance of the S/Co9S8 and S cathodes is significantly higher than that of the S/NCCTVS cathode. This can be attributed to a more serious shuttle effect within the batteries, leading to the incomplete conversion of insulating Li2S/Li2S2 and consequently elevated internal reaction resistances of batteries. In contrast, S/NCCTVS consistently maintained lower reaction resistance during the discharging and charging process, indicating that NCCTVS accelerated the decomposition of Li2S/Li2S2. It is further indicated that NCCTVS has better catalytic activities, which is helpful in improving the overall performance of Li-S batteries. Given the muti-element composition of NCCTVS, it can ascribe its remarkable catalytic capability to the synergetic catalysis effects stemming from the interplay of five metals [20]. Furthermore, the precipitation of Li2S on different cathodes was researched by chronoamperometry. Fig. 5(h and i) presents that the S/NCCTVS cathode possesses the higher capacity for Li2S precipitation (475.94 mA h g−1), which implies that NCCTVS functions well in catalyzing the conversion of intermediates to Li2S throughout the discharge process. Apart from that, S/NCCTVS demonstrates a superior precipitation current (0.66 mA), signifying a faster growth rate of Li2S on the electrode surface and reinforcing the heightened catalytic capability. 4 Conclusions In summary, based on the Hume-Rothery rule, we successfully proposed and synthesized high-entropy sulfides NiCoCuTiVS x derived from Co9S8, and employed it as the catalysts of the sulfur cathode in Li-S batteries. With the synergetic effect of multi metal cations, NiCoCuTiVS x not only offers superior absorbing ability for LiPSs but also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward their conversion. Therefore, the application of NiCoCuTiVS x efficiently inhibits the shuttle effect and reduces the nucleation and activation barriers of Li2S. As a result, the Li-S battery with NiCoCuTiVS x as cathode modification realized the enhanced cycle stability and rate capability. The S/NiCoCuTiVS x cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1366.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, much higher than that of the without-HES batteries. It can still maintain a high discharge capacity of 968.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and its capacity retention is 1.3 times higher than that of S/Co9S8. This work confirms the unique advantages of HES in realizing the advanced Li-S batteries and sparks future endeavors in exploring diverse high-entropy materials for energy storage and conversion.

        "dc:description": "Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high energy density suffer from the soluble lithium polysulfide species. Traditional metal sulfides containing a single metal element used as electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries commonly have limited catalytic abilities to improve battery performance. Herein, based on the Hume-Rothery rule and solvothermal method, the high-entropy sulfide NiCoCuTiVS x derived from Co9S8 was designed and synthesized, to realize the combination of small local strain and excellent catalytic performance. With all five metal elements (Ni, Co, Cu, Ti, and V) capable of chemical interactions with soluble polysulfides, NiCoCuTiVS x exhibited strong chemical confinement of polysulfides and promoted fast kinetics for polysulfides conversion. Consequently, the S/NiCoCuTiVS x cathode can maintain a high discharge capacity of 968.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and its capacity retention is 1.3 times higher than that of S/Co9S8. The improved cycle stability can be attributed to the synergistic effect originating from the multiple metal elements, coupled with the reduced nucleation and activation barriers of Li2S. The present work opens a path to explore novel electrocatalyst materials based on high entropy materials for the achievement of advanced Li-S batteries.",
