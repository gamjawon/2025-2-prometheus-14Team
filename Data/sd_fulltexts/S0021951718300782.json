Tang). Guangzhou Key Laboratory for Surface Chemistry of Energy Materials New Energy Research Institute School of Environment and Energy South China University of Technology Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Guangzhou Guangdong 510006 PR China Graphical abstract Bimetallic core-shell nanostructures have been gaining considerable research attentions recently, mainly thanks to their versatile applications in many fields, including catalysis, electrocatalysis, electronic, sensing and so on. Herein, we demonstrate a peptide templated Au@Pd core-shell structure for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By employing peptide sequence FlgA3 as surface capping agent, core-shell structure with Pd nanoparticles coated on the surface of Au nanoparticles were prepared. The Au@Pd core-shell structures demonstrated effective electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and HER, whereas the catalytic activity was optimized by tuning the Pd-to-Au ratio. Among a series of samples tested, we discovered that the Au@Pd1.0 sample exhibited the best ORR activity, superior to that of Pt/C and Pd/C, while its HER activity was also among the finest, close to that of Pt/C and Pd/C. The Au@Pd1.0 sample also exhibited remarkable stability beyond Pt/C and Pd/C in both ORR and HER. Such intriguing electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the core-shell structure induced lattice strain. The results offer reliable pathway for designing peptide templated core-shell bimetallic nanostructures as dual or multiple functional electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activities and longevity. Keywords Peptide FlgA3 Au@Pd core-shell structure Bifunctional electrocatalysts Oxygen reaction reduction Hydrogen evolution reaction 1 Introduction Bi-metallic noble metal nanostructures, including hierarchical heteronanostructures, alloy nanostructures, and especially core-shell structure have been receiving increasing research attentions in the past decade, and can afford to promising applications in many fields including catalysis, electrocatalysis, electronic, sensing and so forth [1–3]. Core-shell structures often display enhanced electrocatalytic properties due to the lattice strain created between the core and shell region as well as the synergistic effects during the electrocatalytic process. On the other hand, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key reaction occurring at the cathode of fuel cells and metal-air batteries, is a major bottleneck which limits the energy conversion efficiency due to its sluggish reaction kinetics and complicated reaction pathway [4,5]. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been recognized as the most economically efficient method to massively produce hydrogen, an ideal clean energy source with high energy density and environmental friendly nature [6–8]. Among a good variety of bi-metallic core-shell nanostructures, Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles with well-defined morphology generally exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both ORR and HER. Following thrusts reflect the major past research highlights, Shim et al. prepared a carbon supported porous Pd layer-coated Au nanoparticles for ORR, and the sample with a Pd/Au ratio of 0.61 showed superior activity with satisfactory stability and methanol tolerance under acidic conditions [9]. Geng group developed a general and high-yield displacement approach for fabrication of Au-Pd core-shell structures, while the activities of ORR and methanol oxidation reaction were assessed as a typical example for investigation.[10] With the presence of polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and ethylene glycol (EG), Au@Pd core-shell nanothorns with rough and porous surface were fabricated and remarkably high catalytic activity and durability for ORR in the alkaline media were observed [11]. Despite great progresses achieved on Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles as electrocatalysts, there are still several problems remained to be resolved for preparing well-defined Au@Pd core-shell structures under chemical less extreme conditions, i.e. to eliminate the employment of organic molecule and solvent like PAH and EG, which are essential for the preparation of the above Au@Pd core-shell nanothorns [11]. Meanwhile, core-shell Au@Ag nanoparticles were first prepared in organic solvent, then the Ag shell was displaced by Pd precursor by galvanic replacement reaction [12,13]. Ag and Cu2O have been normally chosen as sacrificial templates, which made the preparation process sophisticated, energy consuming and not cost-effective as well. In addition, the employment of organic solvent, harsh reaction conditions are also not environmentally friendly, hence not suitable for sustainable development. A facile approach for preparing Au@Pd core-shell nanostructures as highly efficient electrocatalysts under mild conditions with atomic economy is highly desirable, and this is the primary motivation of our current investigation. The introduction of bio-molecules such as peptide to direct noble metal nanoparticle formation has demonstrated great promises to fulfill the above aim, as the inherent molecular recognition capabilities of these phage-display isolated peptides can be exploited to achieve desirable particle size, shape and functionalities [14,15]. Furthermore, the preparation of these peptide templated metal nanoparticles is conducted in water under ambient conditions without sacrificial agent. Peptide R5 templated Au, Pd and Pt nanostructures with different morphologies have been prepared for ORR in our previous continuous efforts [16–18]. Recently, we have also successfully showcased the fabrication of peptide A4 templated AuAg alloyed nanoparticle networks, and their oxygen reduction performance in alkaline media was examined [19]. On the basis of our recent peptide FlgA3 templated AuPd alloyed nanoparticles as highly efficient electrocatalyst for ORR [20], herein, we report the peptide FlgA3 templated Au@Pd core-shell nanostructures as dual-functional electrocatalysts for both ORR and HER. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials Peptide FlgA3 (DYKDDDDKPAYSSGAPPMPPF, >98%) was obtained from Top-Peptide (Shanghai, China). Gold chloride tri-hydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium tetra-choropalladate (Na2PdCl4), and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were acquired from Energy Chemicals (Shanghai, China). Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). All the chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. All the solutions were prepared with deionized water (resistivity: 18.3 MΩ cm−1). 2.2 Synthesis of Au@Pdx nanoparticles The Au@Pdx (X is the molar ratio of Pd-to-Au, X = 0.17, 0.50, 1.0 and 1.5) samples were prepared by following a modified procedure documented in previous reports [20,21]. In a typical synthesis, 200 µL FlgA3 (5 mg mL−1) and 324.18 µL HAuCl4 (0.04 M) were first mixed in 500 µL HEPES (pH = 7.2, 0.1 M) solution in an eppendorf tube and incubated for 2 h. The intermediate products (peptide-coated Au particles) were recovered by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min and re-dissolved in 500 µL of deionized water. Subsequently, 54.03 µL, 162.09 µL, 324.18 µL, and 486.27 µL of Na2PdCl4 (0.04 M) were added to the above Au nanoparticles, respectively. After incubated for 30 min, the reaction mixture was reduced by NaBH4 (0.1 M) aqueous solution with a volume of 43.23 µL, 129.69 µL, 259.38 µL, and 389.07 µL accordingly and left undisturbed for 1 h. Finally, the product denoted as Au@Pd0.17, Au@Pd0.5, Au@Pd1.0 and Au@Pd1.5 were obtained by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 min and dried at ambient temperature. 2.3 Characterizations The electron microscopic images were acquired by JEM-2100F coupled with high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) imaging at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), bright-field transmission electron microscopy (BF-TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping were acquired in a FEI Tecnai F20 machine. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with an Escalab 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo fisher scientific, USA). 2.4 Electrochemistry Electrochemical measurements for ORR were operated on a CHI 750E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc.) with a conventional three-electrode system at room temperature in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution or 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The as-prepared catalyst-coated glassy carbon disk with gold ring was used as the working electrode. An AgCl/Ag (E Ag/AgCl  = E RHE  + 0.966 V, RHE = reversible hydrogen electrode) with saturated KCl and a platinum foil were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. Slight Pt dissolution might occur during the ORR measurement at the Pt foil counter electrode [22–25], but the ORR performance is not affected. 2 mg of the composite catalysts prepared above were dispersed in 1 mL of 1: 1 (v: v) ethanol/water mixed solvents, and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min to prepare a homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 10 µL of the catalyst ink was dropcast onto the surface of the working electrode and dried at room temperature. In order to prevent the loss of catalyst in the test, the working electrode with catalyst ink was coated by 10 µL Nafion (20 µL/mL, 5 wt%). The catalyst loading was approximately 101.9 µg cm−2 for all the samples. The cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and linear sweep voltammetric measurements were conducted at different rotation rates (225–2025 rpm) in the potential range from −0.04 V to 1.16 V. The current density was calculated based on the geometrical area (0.196 cm2) of the working electrode. Chronoamperometric tests were conducted in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at +0.5 V for 30,000 s, while accelerated durability tests (ADT) were performed by cycling the catalyst over the potential range of +0.6 V to +1.0 V at 50 mV s−1 in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. HER measurements were also performed with the same electrochemical setup in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.1 M KOH aqueous solutions. The as-prepared catalyst-coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE, diameter 3 mm) was used as the working electrode. A Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode and a carbon rod were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. 5 mg of the composite catalysts prepared above were dispersed in 1 mL of 1: 1 (v: v) ethanol/water mixed solvents, along with 50 µL of a Nafion solution (5% Nafion in ethanol). After the mixture was sonicated for 30 min, 5 µL of the catalyst ink was dropwisely cast onto the surface of the GCE at a catalyst loading of 357.1 µg cm−2 and dried at room temperature. The HER durability of Au@Pd1.0 was assessed by accelerated linear potential sweeps conducted repeatedly on the electrode at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. 3 Results and discussions The Au@Pdx series were first prepared by following the modified procedure from previous reports [20,21]. The morphology of the as-prepared samples was then observed by high resolution electron microscopic techniques. The representative TEM and HR-TEM images of the Au@Pd1.0 sample can be found in Fig. 1 a and b. It can be noted that, a large particle is in the center surrounded by several much smaller particles. Continuous crystalline and well-defined lattice fringes can be easily recognized in both the center particle and surrounded particles. The d-spacing of the adjacent fringes is 0.233 nm and 0.223 nm for the center particle and surrounded particles, which agree well with that of Au(1 1 1) [26,27] and Pd(1 1 1) planes [28,29], respectively. It suggests the formation of a special core-shell structure with several small Pd particles are surrounding a large Au particle. From the inset high-angle annular dark-field (HADDF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image in Fig. 1c, the line-scan profile is illustrated. It displays that Pd is in a relatively lower concentration, somewhat slightly enriched at the edges where Au displays a peak-shaped distribution, consistent with the formation of Au-nanoparticle@Pd-nanoparticles core-shell structure. Furthermore, the drift corrected image is presented in Fig. 1d, and energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping images of Au, Pd, Au + Pd are shown in Fig. 1e–g. Notably, Au elements are located in the center while Pd elements are mainly around on the outside. It further confirms the formation of core-shell structure. It is worth noting that, such core-shell structure has been documented in several previous reports [30,31]. Fig. S1 presents the representative TEM image of the other samples in the series. On may notice that, barely Pd particles are surrounding an Au particle for the sample of Au@Pd0.17, however, with the increasing of Pd amount, more Pd particles are around an Au particle. For the sample of Au@Pd1.5, the surface of Au particles became very crowded, and heavy coalescence/aggregation can be observed. It is worth special mentioning that, the surface capping agent of peptide FlgA3 (Sequence: DYKDDDDKPAYSSGAPPMPPF) plays a key role in forming such well-defined core-shell structure. FlgA3 contains two domains of A3 and Flg, the former domain A3 (AYSSGAPPMPPF) can stabilize Au surface and form stable Au nanoparticles [32,33], while the latter domain Flg (DYKDDDDK) possesses binding sites for Pd. Naik et. al. found such Au@Pd core-shell structure stabilized by FlgA3 can catalyze the hydrogenation of 3-buten-1-ol very efficiently in previous studies [21]. XRD measurements were then conducted to further probe the crystal structure of the as-prepared Au@Pdx samples. As shown in Fig. 2 a, compared with the standard card of pure Au (JCPDS-04-0784) and pure Pd (JCPDS-46-1043), well defined peaks located at 38.1, 44.3, 64.5 and 77.5 can be readily identified. It is interesting to notice that, with the increasing of Pd contents, the signal at 40.1 and 82.1 gradually intensified, indicating the increasing of Pd particles coated on the Au surface. In addition, the chemical composition and valence states of the Au@Pdx samples were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2b and c depict the core-level XPS spectra of the Au4f and Pd3d electrons from Au@Pd1.0. For the Au4f electrons, a single pair of peaks can be resolved at approximately 83.4 eV and 87.0 eV, which are in good agreement with the binding energies of the Au4f7/2 and Au4f5/2 electrons of metallic Au, respectively [34–36]. However, for the Pd3d electrons, the spectra can be de-convoluted in two doublets. The pairs at lower energies correspond well with these of metallic Pd, whereas those at somewhat higher energies are probably ascribed to Pd(II) species [37–39]. It indicates the formation of substantial amount of palladium oxide in the Au@Pd structure. The Pd3d and Au4f XPS spectra of the Au@Pdx series can be found in Fig. S2 and similar pattern can be easily recognized. Such phenomenon can be possibly attributed to the electronic interaction between the core Au nanoparticle and the surrounded Pd nanoparticles, and/or the interaction between the peptide FlgA3 and the metal nanoparticles. The Au@Pdx samples were then subjected to oxygen electrocatalytic reduction by CV and RRDE measurements first. As shown in Fig. S3, in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, a cathodic peak attributed to oxygen reduction appeared from 0.50 V to 0.90 V in CV curves, suggesting effective ORR activity of all the samples. The cathodic peak potential was estimated as 0.51 V, 0.72 V, 0.85 V, 0.84 V, 0.85 V and 0.81 V for Au@Pd0.17, Au@Pd0.5, Au@Pd1.0, Au@Pd1.5, Pt/C, and Pd/C, respectively. One may notice that, with the increasing of Pd amount, the ORR activity first increased then decreased, Au@Pd0.5 possessed the lowest cathodic peak potential, while Au@Pd1.0 had the highest cathodic peak potential. As a note, the ORR and HER activities of the series of samples, Pt/C, and Pd/C are compiled in Table 1 . Fig. 3 a presents the CV curves of the Au@Pd1.0 sample in N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. In N2-saturated alkaline solution, featureless pattern in CV profile can be observed, while in O2-saturated alkaline solution, there is a sharp oxygen reduction peak at 0.83 V, suggesting excellent catalytic activity. To further examine the ORR activity of the series samples, RRDE measurements were conducted. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, the LSV curves clearly show that the half-wave potentials and diffusion-limited current densities varied dramatically with the initial Pd-to-Au loading ratios. The half-wave potential and the diffusion-limited current density of the series samples at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm as well as Pt/C and Pd/C are summarized in Table 1. The samples of Au@Pd1.0 and Au@Pd1.5 bear more positive half-wave potential superior than Pt/C and Pd/C but slightly lower current density than Pt/C and Pd/C. The results further confirm the above findings, the ORR activity first increased then decreased with the increasing of Pd-to-Au ratio, and Au@Pd1.0 possessed the best activity among the series, evidenced by the most positive half-wave potential and the largest diffusion-limited current among the series. Since Au@Pd1.0 has been proved to exhibit the best activity among the series, its ORR catalytic properties were further investigated and compared with the state-of-art Pt/C and Pd/C catalyst. From Fig. 3c, one can see that, the voltammetric currents increased with the increasing of the rotation rate of the electrode. The corresponding Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots are presented in Fig. 3d, and excellent linearity with consistent slopes can be observed within the potential range from 0.30 V to 0.60 V, implying that the reaction proceeded with a first-order kinetics with respect to the dissolved O2 concentration in solution. In addition, the voltammetric current change with the electrode rotation rate and corresponding K-L plots of the other samples as well as Pt/C and Pd/C can be found in Fig. S5. Similar current change trend and great linearities were obtained as well. To further elucidate the reaction kinetics, the Tafel plots of the Au@Pd1.0 sample, Pt/C and Pd/C were extrapolated from the corresponding K-L analysis and presented in Fig. 3e. The Tafel slope was calculated as 68.1 mV dec−1, 82.8 mV dec−1 and 88.1 mV dec−1 for Au@Pd1.0, Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively. The Tafel slope for Au@Pd1.0 is quite close to that of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, which implies that a similar reaction mechanism was adopted for both catalysts. As a note, it has been widely accepted that, by using Pt/C as catalysts, the reaction rate was determined by the first electron transfer to oxygen molecules [3,40–43]. Furthermore, based on the RRDE voltammetric measurements, the number of electron transfer (n) and yield of H2O2 were calculated by n = 4 I d I d + I r / N H 2 O 2 = 200 I r / N I r / N + I d In the above equations, Id is the disk current, Ir is the ring current, n is the electron transfer number and N is the RRDE collection efficiency with a value of 0.37. Fig. 3f shows the calculated n values and yields of H2O2. As summarized in Table 1, in the potential range from 0 to +0.80 V, the electron transfer number of Au@Pd1.0 is 3.91–3.96, which is slightly higher than that of Pt/C and Pd/C, while correspondingly, the H2O2 yield was 4.3–2.5%, which is also lower than that of Pt/C and Pd/C. The results further attest that the Au@Pd1.0 took a very efficient direct 4e pathway superior than that of Pt/C and Pd/C in the complete reduction of oxygen molecule to water. The long-term stability of the Au@Pd1.0 sample for ORR was next compared with Pt/C and Pd/C by chronoamperometric measurements at 0.5 V. As described in Fig. 4 a, upon continuous operation of about 8 h, the cathodic current of Pt/C dropped 20% and Pd/C dropped 15% of their initial values, while in contrast, for Au@Pd1.0, the initial current remained about 96.5% (only 3.5% loss) under the same conditions. Accelerated durability tests were further conducted to assess the long-term durability of the Au@Pd1.0 sample with commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, and the results are presented in Fig. 4b–d. After cycling the catalysts over the potential range of +0.4 V to +1.2 V at 50 mV s−1 in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for 2500 cycles, the half-wave potential displayed a negative shift of 16 mV for Pt/C and 21 mV for Pd/C, while only 4 mV negative shift was observed for Au@Pd1.0. Both the chronoamperometric tests and accelerated durability tests suggest that markedly superior long-term stability than Pt/C and Pd/C was acquired for Au@Pd1.0 in ORR. Furthermore, the ORR activity of the Au@Pdx series was tested in 0.1 M HClO4 and compared with commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts as well [44]. Fig. S4 depicts the polarization curves of the series samples, Pt/C, and Pd/C at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. Interestingly, with the increasing of Pd amount, the ORR activity in acid media also first intensified then diminished. The Au@Pd1.0 sample exhibited the best ORR performance among the series, and its activity was also superior than that of Pt/C and Pd/C, as manifested by the more positive onset potential (0.90 V vs. 0.87 V for Pt/C and 0.81 V for Pd/C) and larger kinetic current density at 0.30 V (5.76 mA cm−2 vs 4.68 mA cm−2 for Pt/C and 3.05 mA cm−2 for Pd/C). In addition to ORR, the electrocatalytic HER activity of the peptide templated Au@Pdx samples was also evaluated with a catalyst loading of 357.1 μg cm−2 in comparison with Pt/C and Pd/C. As shown in LSV curves in Fig. 5 a, the commercial Pt/C exhibited the highest HER activity, with an onset overpotential nearly zero, while the Au@Pdx samples displayed effective but less efficient activity. Notably, the Au@Pd0.17 sample displayed negligible HER activity. Other than that, to afford a current density of 20 mA cm−2, the required overpotential was −168 mV, −116 mV, −140 mV, −40 mV, and −91 mV for the samples of Au@Pd0.5, Au@Pd1.0, Au@Pd1.5, Pt/C, and Pd/C, respectively. With the increasing of Pd amount in the Au@Pdx series, the HER activity first intensified then became weakened. Au@Pd1.0 displayed the best HER activity. The Tafel slopes were then calculated and compared with Pt/C and Pd/C (Fig. 5b). Au@Pd1.0 exhibited the lowest Tafel slope (66 mV dec−1) value, which is quite close to that of Pt/C and Pd/C among the whole series. Interestingly, the series of Au@Pdx samples also demonstrated effective HER activity in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution (Fig. S6). Again, Pt/C exhibited the best activity while Au@Pd0.17 barely displayed catalytic hydrogen evolution capability in alkaline electrolyte. To reach a current density of 20 mA cm−2, the required overpotential was −600 mV, −427 mV, −485 mV, −200 mV and −349 mV for the sample of Au@Pd0.5, Au@Pd1.0, Au@Pd1.5, Pt/C, and Pd/C, respectively. One may notice that, for the samples of Au@Pd1.0 and Au@Pd1.5, a hydrogen adsorption peak around −0.1 V appeared. Such phenomenon has lined up well with several other reports regarding Pd based nanomaterials for HER [45–47]. The relative higher amount of Pd in these two samples resulted in the increase of the number of palladium active sites for HER, which led to the appearance of hydrogen adsorption peak [46]. Finally, the long-term stability of Au@Pd1.0 toward HER was also compared with Pt/C and Pd/C by cycling the catalysts for 3000 cycles in acid electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5c–e, after 1000 cycles, to afford a current density of 20 mA cm−2, the required overpotential increased 7.1 mV, 4.7 mV, and 33.1 mV for Au@Pd1.0, Pt/C, and Pd/C, however, after 2000 cycles, the increased overpotential was 12.2 mV, 25.7 mV and 9.6 mV, and after 3000 cycles, it became 25.6 mV, 91.9 mV and 9 mV for Au@Pd1.0, Pt/C, and Pd/C, respectively. This solidifies our evaluation that the Au@Pd1.0 sample possessed much higher stability than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C for HER in acid media. Interestingly, with the increasing of the Pd content, the ORR and HER activity first increased then decreased, and the Au@Pd1.0 sample outperformed than the other samples in the series. Previous studies have shown that, for most bimetallic core-shell structures (e.g. M@Pt), the shell thickness would significantly affect the electrocatalytic activity through the tuned electronic effects [48–51]. While in this study, with the increasing of the Pd content, more Pd nanoparticles formed on the surface of the Au nanoparticle, resulted in the increasing of electrocatalytic activity, while further increase of Pd contents resulted in particle coalescence and aggregation, as observed in TEM analysis. Such phenomenon led to certain over-saturation and therefore trigger the blockage of some electrocatalytically active sites, hence diminished the electrocatalytic activity. The associated electronic effects with the variation of Pd content may also be crucial for the electrocatalytic activity change, yet further investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of the potential mechanisms regarding the Pd content affects the catalytic activity. Moreover, the ORR and HER activities of the Au@Pd1.0 sample were better than or at least comparable with recently reported AuPd alloys, Au@Pd bimetallic nanomaterials as well as other similar Au-Pd structures. The comparison results are compiled in Table S1. For instance, when employing 0.1 M KOH as electrolyte, the onset potential was 0.93 V, 0.95 V, 0.95 V, and 0.94 V for AuPd alloyed flowerlike-assembly nanochains (1 M KOH),[52] peptide FlgA3 templated Au33Pd67 nanoparticles [20], Au@Pd core-shell nanothorns [11], and carbon nanosheets supported Au67Pd33 nanoclusters [53], respectively, all of which was lower than the sample of Au@Pd1.0 (0.97 V). For HER, to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, the required overpotential was −79 mV for the Au@Pd1.0 sample, close to the value for reduced graphene oxide supported AuPd bimetallic nanoparticles [54] (−55 mV) and nanocrystals [55] (−55 mV). The above comparison further illustrates that, peptide templated approach to create bimetallic core-shell nanostructures hold great promises for fabricating bifunctional electrocatalysts toward ORR and HER with high efficiency and robust stability. Such remarkable ORR and HER activities from Au@Pd1.0 can be probably attributed to the well-defined core-shell structure induced lattice strain. Note that, control of lattice strain of bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles has been widely considered and employed as a viable strategy to tune the ORR activity in previous investigations [48,56,57]. Herein, for the sample of Au@Pd1.0, lattice mismatch exists between the core Au nanoparticle and surrounded Pd nanoparticles due to the differences of lattice parameter which was observed in the HR-TEM analysis. Such mismatch resulted in strain in the crystal lattice over several atomic layers around the interface, leading to the change of d-band center. The altered d-band center could affect the molecule-sorption hence altering the catalytic activity [58–60]. Specifically, for the sample of Au@Pd1.0, the optimal lattice strain led to the optimized sorption energies of O2 or H+, and eventually the best activity was acquired. Further computational calculations are probably needed to obtain some mechanistic insights regarding this lattice strain effects. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, upon the employment of peptide sequence FlgA3 as template, we successfully fabricated a series of Au@Pd nanoparticles and demonstrated as core-shell structures. The series of core-shell structures exhibited effective catalytic activities toward both ORR and HER. Au@Pd1.0 showed the best ORR activity, of which was superior to the benchmark Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. Also, its HER activity was the finest among the whole series, close to that of Pt/C and Pd/C. The sample exhibited remarkably higher long-term stability than Pt/C and Pd/C for both ORR and HER. The enhanced catalytic activities and robust durability are attributed to the core-shell structure induced lattice strain. The findings here not only highlight the merits of peptide enabled approach, but also might afford to a pathway for further rational design of peptide mediated bimetallic core-shell structures with optimized multifunctional electrocatalytic activities and desirable stability.

        "dc:description": "Bimetallic core-shell nanostructures have been gaining considerable research attentions recently, mainly thanks to their versatile applications in many fields, including catalysis, electrocatalysis, electronic, sensing and so on. Herein, we demonstrate a peptide templated Au@Pd core-shell structure for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By employing peptide sequence FlgA3 as surface capping agent, core-shell structure with Pd nanoparticles coated on the surface of Au nanoparticles were prepared. The Au@Pd core-shell structures demonstrated effective electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and HER, whereas the catalytic activity was optimized by tuning the Pd-to-Au ratio. Among a series of samples tested, we discovered that the Au@Pd1.0 sample exhibited the best ORR activity, superior to that of Pt/C and Pd/C, while its HER activity was also among the finest, close to that of Pt/C and Pd/C. The Au@Pd1.0 sample also exhibited remarkable stability beyond Pt/C and Pd/C in both ORR and HER. Such intriguing electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the core-shell structure induced lattice strain. The results offer reliable pathway for designing peptide templated core-shell bimetallic nanostructures as dual or multiple functional electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activities and longevity.",
