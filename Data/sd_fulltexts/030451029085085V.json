PAKKANEN Department of Chemistry, University of Joensuu, SF-80101 Joensuu (Finland) (Received May 15,1989; accepted September 1,1989) Summary The water-gas shift reaction under mild conditions (^150 C, ^1 atm CO) has been catalyzed with Ru3(CO)i2-bidentate amine complexes as precursors, where the amine is 2,2'-bipyridine, 2,3'-bipyridine, 2,4'- bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or 2,9-dmphen-S. Other iron group metal homo- and heteronuclear clusters together with 2,2'-bipyridine were also found active. RuaCCOia with 2,2'-bipyridine forms an air-sensitive compound which was found to be most active (4400 turnovers per 24 h at 150 C). Reactions of 2,2'-bipyridine with iron-containing clusters lead to the decom- position of metal cluster cores and to the formation of catalytically inactive compounds. Introduction The water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, eqn. (1)) is an important method for producing hydrogen for many purposes: Fisher Tropsch-type syntheses, ammonia synthesis, production of hydrocarbon fuels and organic chemicals from nonpetroleum sources. CO+HgO-^Hg+COa (1) Commercial methods for carrying out the shift reaction involve hetero- geneous metal oxide catalysts at elevated temperatures. The most common type is based on Fe304, promoted by Cra03 operating at about 350 C. The low temperature Cu-ZnO catalysts often used together with the high temperature catalysis are active at around 200 C [1]. The equilibrium of the WGSR shifts to the products at lower tempera- tures. The residual carbon monoxide concentrations (T=300 C, P(CO)= 2.5mol%; T=200 C, P(CO) =0.3mol%)** are, however, often too high for some applications, e.g. ammonia synthesis. Thermodynamics of the WGSR at low temperatures thus gives greater efficiency and allows smaller thermal inputs**. Several studies have been reported in which metal complexes and *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **Thermodynamic constants of WGSR are taken from [2] Affi^g = -9.84 kcal mol~1, AGiag = -6.82, AS0 = -10.1 cal deg-1 for HaOtg). 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 34 clusters have been shown to catalyze the WGSR under mild conditions in homogeneous media [2 12]. The turnover numbers of all of these homoge- neous systems are, however, too low for industrial applications. Bidentate ligands containing nitrogen donor atoms form many catalytically-interesting transition metal complexes. Bipyridine salts have been shown to be moderately active in the WGSR [9-12], in photo-induced hydrogen evolution [13,14], and in photochemical [15,16] and electrochemi- cal [17-21] reduction of COg to CO. Catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline is an example of a reaction which is catalyzed by metal clusters (Ru3(CO)i2 and RhgCCOic) with bidentate nitrogen-containing ligands as catalyst precursors [22]. Our earlier studies on the catalysis of WGSR by Ru3(CO)ig in amine solutions showed that practically all these homogeneous systems have low or zero activity [23]. The behaviour of 2,2'-bipyridine is different. It forms a heterogeneous catalyst with Ru3(CO)iz which is more active than other known homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in comparable conditions [24]. We report here the results from a study of WGSR under mild conditions catalyzed by bidentate base with RuaCCOia and some other iron group clusters. Experimental Reagents Metal carbonyls RuaCCOia, OsaCCO)^ and Feg(CO)i2 were purchased from Ventron Co. Fe3(CO)ia was recrystallized from CHgClg before use. 1,10-Phenanthroline and 2,3'-bipy(bipyridine) from EGA-Chemie, 2,2'-bipy from Ventron Co., 2,4'-bipy and 2,9-dmphen-S (2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl- 1,10-phenanthroline disodium sulfonate) from Aldrich were used as received. Mixed metal clusters FezRuCCO)^, FeRuz(CO)i2 [25] and HaFeRua^Ois [26] were prepared by literature methods. Water was degassed with N3 before use. Carbon monoxide and methane were high-purity grade.

Bidentate amines used to catalyze WGSR. 35 Catalytic procedure, apparatus and analysis The catalytic runs were carried out in a 120ml single-neck flask equipped with a Teflon stopcock. From the side arm the flask was connected to a stainless steel vacuum line which was connected to a gas manifold, to a vacuum pump and to a gas chromatograph. In the reaction vessel 20 jumol of the cluster and 60-200 ^mol of the bidentate base were weighed out. The flask was evacuated and loaded with CO several times and HgO was added with a syringe under a flow of CO. The reaction vessel was heated in a thermostat-controlled oil bath ( 0.1 C). After an induction period, the flask was evacuated and recharged at the desired pressure (0.5-0.8 atm) with CO which contained 4 6 mol% methane as an internal standard. Analysis of the gas contents were accomplished by a Carlo Erba 4200 multi-column chromato- graph before and after reaction. The turnover frequencies (mol of gas (mol cluster x 24h)~1) were determined for Hg and COg productions. The details of the gas analysis and the apparatus have been reported previously [7]. Preparation and characterization of the catalysts The catalysts prepared from clusters and amines have been formed directly in the reaction flask. 2,2'-, 2,3'- and 2,4'-bipyridines, 1,10- phenanthroline and 2,9-dmphen-S were tested as amines with RuatCOia as the cluster. The effect of the metal composition of the cluster was studied using 2,2'-bipy as the amine and Fe3(CO)i2, FegRuCCOia, FeRu2(CO)i2, Os3(CO)i2, Ru3(CO)uPPh3, H2FeRu3(CO)i3 or H4Ru4(CO)i2 as the cluster. The system showing the highest activity was prepared as follows: Ru3(CO)i2 and 2,2'-bipyridine form a dark blue complex upon heating above 70 C in CO- or N2-atmosphere or in vacuum. The complex adsorbs strongly on glass. The complexation is not instantaneous, due to the slow sublimation of both reactants. The compound is air-sensitive and insoluble in polar and nonpolar solvents. Spectroscopic characterization of the Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipy catalyst was carried out by FT-IR techniques in different matrices. When the activated catalyst is mixed with KBr, shows four carbonyl absorptions appear at 2024 m, 1963 vs, 1907 m, 1883 m cm\"1 and absorptions due to the bipyridine ligand at 1597 w, 1463m, 1439 w, 1424 w, 1319 w, 1252m, 1159 w and 988 w cm\"1. The catalyst can be also prepared directly on a ZnS window, yielding a transmittance spectrum. The spectra in both cases are very similar. The bipyridine absorptions differ from the spectrum of free bipyrid- ine, indicating complexation. In the presence of oxygen the absorptions at wavenumbers 2024,1907 and 1883 cm~1 disappear, showing the air-sensitive nature of the compound. Elemental analysis of the compound formed gave C 39.7%, N 7.1%, H 2.2% and 0 16%. Results and discussion The turnover numbers for activated Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipyridine catalyst precursor are presented in Table 1 as a function of initial pressure, 36 TABLE 1 Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipyridine as water-gas shift reaction catalyst* 2,2'-bipy Pressure Temperature Reaction Turnover frequency1' Ru3(CO)i2 (torr) (oc) time mole ratio (h) An, -Agoa 1 380 100 1.5 50 50 2 400 100 1.5 180 190 3 390 100 1.5 680 690 4 400 100 1.5 690 690 8 200 100 1.0 250 248 8 288 100 1.0 388 390 8 350 100 1.0 500 490 8 624 100 1.0 750 758 3 600 150 0.25 4400 4400' 'Conditions: HgO 0.36ml; Ru3(CO)ia 20 ^mdl; 130ml flask. b Mol of gas/mol of catalyst per 24 h. c The reaction was carried out in a 30 ml flask. temperature and amine cluster molar ratio. An induction period of 24 h or more at 100 C in the presence of water is necessary to activate the system for the water-gas shift reaction. At the beginning of the reaction the blue complex forms a uniform thin film on the surface of the flask. After the induction period the catalyst surface becomes less uniform, with an ap- parently higher surface area. The catalytic activity depends on the Ru3(CO)i2-amine molar ratio. The formation of the active catalyst requires more than two moles of amine for each Rua(CO)i2. The activity of the Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipy system also depends on the initial CO pressure and on the temperature. The measured catalytic activity of 4400 is one of the highest reported for WGSR in mild reaction conditions. The observed slight lowering of activity after several chargings and WGSR experiments is probably due to trace amounts of oxygen introduced into the system in the charging steps. The uniqueness of the Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipy system is demonstrated when the cluster or amine part of the catalyst is altered (Table 2). The tetranuclear cluster H4Ru4(CO)i2 does not form a similar active catalytic species with 2,2'-bipy. The observed moderate activity is probably due to cluster fragmentation to RuaCCOig. The low and zero activity of Ru3(CO)i2-2,3'-bipy and Rua(CO)i2-2,4'- bipy respectively shows that the active catalyst should have the nitrogens of the bipyridine in the 2,2' positions. 1,10-Phenanthroline and 2,9-dmphen-S have a geometry of donor nitrogens similar to 2,2'-bipy (Fig. 1). Only 1,10-phenanthroline reacts with Rua(CO)i2> forming a blue complex similar to that in the 2,2'-bipy case. The low activity (80 turnovers) of the Ru3(CO)i2-l,10-phenanthroline catalyst is noteworthy, since the reduction of nitrobenzene catalyzed by this catalyst 37 TABLE 2 Catalysis ofWGSR by iron group cluster precursors\" Metal cluster Amine Reaction time(h) Turnover frequency RU3(CO)iz 2,3'-bipy 1.5 10 RU3(CO)i2 2,4'-bipy 1.5 0 RU3(CO)i2 1,10-phen 1.5 80 RU3(CO)i2 2,9-dmphen-S 1.5 0 FezRuCCOiz 2,2'-bipy 4.0 19 FeRu2(CO)i2 2,2'-bipy 4.0 34 OS3(CO)i2 2,2'-bipy 3.0 0 FC3(CO)i2 2,2'-bipy 1.5 0 H2FeRu3(CO)i3 2,2'-bipy 4.0 30 Ru3(CO)iiPPli3 2,2'-bipy 1.5 65 [Ru(CO)3Cl2]a 2,2'-bipy 1.5 1 H4RU4(CO)ia 2,2'-bipy 4.0 115 a Conditions: H^O 0.36 ml; cluster 20 fimol; P(CO) = 400-550 torr; 130 ml flask. precursor is more effective than by Ru3(CO)i2-2,2'-bipy [18]. In the present reaction conditions, the low volatility of 1,10-phenanthroline may have prevented the formation of the catalytic speices. All other studied catalyst precursors prepared from 2,2'-bipy and carbonyl compounds have either low or zero activity in WGSR. The synergetic effect of iron-ruthenium found for the mixed metal clusters on WGSR in pyridine medium [7] was not observed. The increasing iron content of the cluster leads to formation of increasing quantities of catalytically inactive complexes of iron. References 1 C. N.
