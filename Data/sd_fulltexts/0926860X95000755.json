Three different zeolite catalysts (USY-zeolite, H-ZSM5 and H-mordenite) were investigated at normal pressure under various experimental conditions with the disproportionation of ethylbenzene (EBD) as test reaction and nitrogen as inert gas. By means of the physical properties, IR-measuremeut and TPD-measurement, the experimental results could be explained sufficiently. Keywords: Deactivation; Ethylbenzene disproportionation; Zeolites 1. Introduction Zeolites play an important role in several acid catalysed reactions such as crack- ing and isomerisation of hydrocarbons, alkylation of alkanes and aromatics and the polymerisation of alkenes. On the basis of the pore structure faujasite, ZSM-5 and mordenite are three important zeolites from the catalytic and industrial point of view. The faujasite has a three-dimensional channel structure with an internal pore diameter of 7.4 A [ 1 ]. It belongs to the group of large pore zeolites. The ZSM-5 belongs to the group of pentasils. The channel system of this catalyst consists of vertical channels with the size of 5.3 x 5.6 A and perpendicular to zigzag- formed channels, whose dimension account to 5.1 X 5.5 A [ 1 ]. The diameter of the channels of ZSM-5 is approximately in the dimensional range of aromatic mole- cules, so that ZSM-5 has a high shape-selectivity in catalytic reactions. * Corresponding author.

Hofmann/Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 10~118 The H-mordenite belongs to the mordenite group. It shows however a bimodale, two-dimensional pore structure, which is also disconnected by cavities. The small channels (2.6 5.7 A) are in the same range and are not accessible for the organic molecules used here. Thus the channel system of mordenite can be considered as one-dimensional. The large channel has an elliptic shape with a diameter of 6.5 X 7.0 A[1]. The disproportionation of ethylbenzene (EBD) into benzene (B) and diethyl- benzene (DEB) used here as test reaction was introduced by Karge et al. to characterize the BrCnsted acidity of large pore zeolites, e.g. faujasites [2] and mordenites [3,4]. The use of ZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst is especially interesting due to its high resistance to deactivation by coking and due to its high shape- selectivity [ 5-7 ]. Although a great number of papers has been already published dealing with studies on those catalysts for various reaction systems, it is necessary to further investigate the activity and deactivation behavior of those zeolite catalysts. In the present paper, three zeolite catalysts from the Stid-Chemie AG (USY- zeolite Si/AI: 2.3-2.5 (USYZ), H-ZSM5 Si/AI: 15 (ZSM-5) and H-mordenite Si/AI: 10) have been investigated in a gradientless reactor at normal pressure and various temperatures (573-673 K) and two different molar fractions of EB in the feed (0.2 and 0.8) with nitrogen as inert gas. 2. Experimental equipment and method The computer controlled experimental equipment consists of a feeding system, a gradientless reactor which could be exchanged by an integral reactor, a gas chromatograph for the analysis of the reaction mixture, and the data processing and control unit consisting of two PCs. A detailed description of the experimental set up can be found in ref. [8]. The physico-chemical properties play an important role in the activity of the catalysts studied here. Therefore BET-surface and pore radius distribution were measured by means of nitrogen sorption at its boiling temperature in a volumetric sorption equipment (Micromeritics, Modell 2100 D). The results of the measure- ments are listed in Table 1. The acidity of catalysts plays an important role in the reaction behavior of catalysts. A method often used to determine the acidity of catalysts is IR-spectros- copy with adsorbed pyridine. Pyridine constitutes with BrOnsted and Lewis acid centres of various surface complexes, which display then in the IR-spectra peaks at different wavelengths. Pyridine, coordinated with the Lewis centre, yields a peak at 1450 cm-~, protonated pyridine on the BrOnsted centre a peak at 1540 cm ~. Both complexes yield also a peak at 1490 cm- l [ 12,13].

By means of the IR-spectroscopy the nature and the number of acid centres of catalysts can be determined. The relative strength of acid centres was determined by means of TPD with ammonia. The catalyst sample (particle size 0.63-0.8 mm) was calcined for 6 h at 673 K under nitrogen. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Comparison of different catalysts Conversion The conversion against time on stream of the three catalysts at 573 K and 673 K are presented as an example in Fig. 1 ~. It can be seen that the conversion levels of all three catalysts remain nearly constant at low temperature (573 K) during the time on stream. The conversion increases clearly at higher temperature, but remains constant only for ZSM-5. This indicates that ZSM-5 does not deactivate at low molar fraction of EB, even at high temperature. For the H-mordenite the conversion In the Figure Nml/min represents the flow rate ml/min at standard temperature and pressure; the data given at time zero are values measured at 3 min after the educt was fed into the reactor. 110 1 0,8 0,6 0,4 0,2 F.

Conversion over three catalysts at 573 K and 673 K, and YEs0 = 0.2(N2). 120 decreases rapidly at high temperature with time on stream. The USYZ is generally less active than the ZSM-5 and the H-mordenite. As shown in Fig. 2, the conversion levels of all three catalysts decrease with higher EB-molar fraction. This shows that the formal reaction order of the dispro- portionation must be lower than one, if the rate of EBD is modelled by a simple power law rate equation instead of a probably more realistic hyperbolic kinetic model [9]. The ZSM-5 slowly loses its activity with time on stream at a higher EB-molar fraction and higher temperature, because the deactivation due to coking gains in strength at those experimental conditions. Main products Fig. 3 shows the concentration vs. time on stream of the main products benzene and diethylbenzene at 573 K. It can be seen that the amounts of benzene (B) and diethylbenzene (DEB) produced are almost numerically equal on all three catalysts. By-products were barely found, and no observable deactivation appeared at this temperature. The ZSM-5 produced the highest concentrations of benzene and DEB, followed by the H-mordenite. The product concentration on the USYZ did not reach 1/3 of the product concentration on ZSM-5 at the same experimental conditions. Fig. 4 illustrates the situation at 673 K on those catalysts. The ZSM-5 produces the highest concentration of benzene and the lowest concentration of DEB, which indicates a higher dealkylation activity. In the initial stage of the reaction H- mordenite shows the same concentration levels as the ZSM-5. But with increasing time on stream the concentration of benzene decreases quickly, whereas the con- centration of DEB increases slowly. This indicates that at high activity of H- mordenite more consecutive reactions starting from DEB occur; this means that the secondary reactions occur predominantly on the most active acid centres of H- mordenite, because the concentrations of by-products decrease rapidly with increas- ing deactivation of the catalyst.

Concentration comparison of main products at 573 K. 120 Because of the low activity of the USYZ low concentrations of benzene are also observed. In view of the ratio benzene to DEB there is only a little excess of benzene from dealkylation in the initial stage of the reaction, which gets smaller with longer time on stream. A comparison of the DEB isomers distribution (p-, o-, m-) was given in [ 11 ]. By-products Because secondary reactions occur on a very small scale at low temperatures over the three catalysts, the formation of by-products of EBD are compared only at 673 K. Fig. 5 shows the product concentrations for USYZ. It can be seen that more by-products appear in the initial phase of the experiment. LC here represents the light components ethane, propane, butane, etc. [ 10]. A comparison of the by- products formed at the ZSM-5 and the H-mordenite is shown in Fig. 6.

Concentrations of products over USYZ at 673 K. see that the concentrations of LC with the ZSM-5 and the H-mordenite are much higher than the concentrations of other by-products. This means that these catalysts must be more acidic, and therefore the dealkylation is preferred, toluene (T) is the second most important by-product. The concentrations of methylethylbenzene (MEB) differ scarcely for the three catalysts. The concentrations of by-products on ZSM-5 remain constant during the time on stream used. For the H-mordenite the concentrations of by-products decrease quickly in the initial phase of the experiment due to the deactivation of the catalyst. Comparison of coke contents A comparison of coke contents of the three catalysts after 2 h of time on stream at different temperature is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the H-mordenite has a stronger coking tendency than the other catalysts at the same experimental con- Ci [mol/ml*E7] 10 673 K 8 I00 Nml/min Y(EBO)=O.Z(N2) 2 ~ x ~ ~ ^ ~ ^ o , . v . v . ~-. 2 ~ 2 , 2 .^~ 0 10 ~0 30 40 50 60 70 80 go 100 110 120 Zeit [min] I ~ LK(ZSM5) --+-- LK(H--Mordenite) + T(ZSMS) [ T(H-Mordenite) + MEB(ZSMS) + MEB(H-Mordenite) Fig. 6.

Comparison of coke contents over three catalysts at different temperatures after 2 h. ditions. Therefore the conversion of EB over H-mordenite decreases quickly at higher temperature. The coke contents on ZSM-5 are clearly lower than on the other catalysts, therefore the ZSM-5 does not deactivate significantly at these experimental conditions. Comparing the Si/Al-modules (ZSM-5 15, H-mordenite 10.2 and USYZ 2.8), it can be deduced, that the smaller coke content of ZSM-5 is caused by its higher Si/Al-module. This interpretation is supported by the work of Kolb [ 10], who found a decreasing coking tendency with increasing value of the Si/Al-module over a HY-zeolite. Thus not only the pore structure but also the Si/ Al-module plays an important role in coking of catalysts. In view of the middle coke content and the low conversion of EB on the USYZ, one can deduce that it has a large coking tendency. In general the coke content of all catalysts increases with increasing temperature. Fig. 8 presents the coke contents of three catalysts at different feed molar fraction. It can be seen that the coke content of the catalysts rises with increasing EB molar fraction. The only slight difference in coke content on H-mordenite is presumably a result of the one-dimensional channel system.

Comparison of IR-spectra on USYZ, H-mordenite and ZSM-5. The coke content of the ZSM-5 at a molar fraction of YEBo = 0.8 is more than twice as large as at YEBo = 0.2. Comparing Fig. 8 with Fig. 7 results in the conclu- sion, that the influence on the coke content over ZSM-5 of the EB-molar fraction in feed is much stronger than the influence of temperature. This means that the mass transport (physical factor) in ZSM-5 is an important factor for coking behav- ior. For the H-mordenite the temperature (chemical factor) is a very important factor concerning the coking of the catalyst. For the USYZ both factors are signif- icant. 3.2. Physico-chemical properties of catalysts As shown in Table 1, USY-zeolite has the highest BET-surface, even though its activity on the basis of EBD is not very high, obviously due to the weaker acidity of the acidic centres (see Fig. 11 ). A relatively high activity and no deactivation is observed for the ZSM-5, which has almost the same BET-surface and specific pore volume as the H-mordenite. This means, obviously one cannot determine the activity as well as the deactivation behavior of catalysts from the comparison of average micro-, meso-and macropore radius alone. It depends also on the chemical properties of catalysts. Fig. 9 shows the adsorption bands of BPy, BLPy and LPy (from left to right) for the three catalysts (USYZ, H-mordenite and ZSM-5). From Fig. 9 and Table 2 one can see that the ZSM-5 possesses the highest number of acid centres among the three catalysts. Thus the ZSM-5 presents the highest activity for the EBD (Fig. 1 ). It is of interest to note that the larger the difference of the number of 116 F. Niu, H.

Moreover from Table 2 and results of the experiments one can deduce that the total acid sites (BLPy) affect the conversion of EB; the BrCnsted acid sites (Bpy) rule the EBD; the Lewis acid sites (LPy) play a major role in coke formation. Fig. 10 presents the total amount of ammonia desorbed from the various catalysts with increasing temperature. The desorption rates of ammonia at various temper- atures are shown in Fig. 11. From Fig. 10, Table 1 and Table 2 it is clear that the USY-zeolite adsorbed the highest amount of ammonia because of its high BET-surface, even though on the W [mg Ammonia /g Catal./K] 0,6 0,5 0,4 0,3 0,2 0,1 0 373 423 473 523 573 623 673 723 773 823 873 923 973 Temperature [K] USYZ ] ZSM-5 ~< H-Mordenit Fig. 11.

Hofmann/Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 107-118 117 basis of the EBD it does not have a high activity, obviously because of the lower acid strength of the active sites (see Fig. 11). A relative high activity and no deactivation appear with the ZSM-5, which has almost equal BET-surface and a similar specific pore volume compared with the H-mordenite, because the ZSM-5 has a high Si/Al-module and the amount of Lewis centres and of BrCnsted centres are almost equal. As shown clearly in Fig. 11, for each desorption curve two peaks occur practically, which indicate the different strengths of the acid centres 2. Com- paring the curves in Fig. 11 and the results of experiments (conversion), it is obvious that the second peak representing stronger acid centres plays the important role in the EBD. This means that the stronger the second acid centre on the basis of the TPD of ammonia, the higher is the activity of catalyst concerning the EBD. The second TPD peak of the USYZ (at ca. 773 K) appears at lower temperature compared with the other catalysts. This means that the active centre of the USYZ is weaker, thus it has a lower activity concerning the EBD. The second TPD peak of the H-mordenite appears just below 923 K whereas the second peak of the ZSM- 5 appears above 923 K. This means that the ZSM-5 possesses the strongest acid centre. From this argumentation, it is clear that the activity of the catalyst on the basis of EBD depends also on the strength of the 923 K acid centre. 4. Conclusions Although the USY-zeolite possesses the largest BET-surface, it does not present high activity concerning the EBD due to its weak acid centres. The ZSM-5 has the highest activity for the EBD among the catalysts investigated, the highest dealky- lation activity and the lowest coking tendency. The mass transport (physical factor) in ZSM-5 is an important factor for coking behavior. For the H-mordenite the temperature (chemical factor) is a dominant factor, which determines the activity and the coking tendency due to its one-dimensional channel systems. For all zeolites the coking tendency of catalysts increases clearly with increasing temperature and molar feed fraction of EB. By means of IR-and TPD-measurements of the catalysts the following conclu- sions can be obtained: -- the coking tendency of catalysts is not only dependent on the Si/Al-module of the zeolite, but also presumably on the ratio of Lewis centres and BrOnsted centres and the pore structure; -- the activity of the catalyst for EBD is not only dependent on the number of acid centres, but also on the strength as well as the structure and the compo- sition of the catalyst. 2 A 'blank' TPD experiment on each zeolite (without adsorbing NH3) showed that USYZ, H-mordenite and ZSM-5 lost separately 0.3%, 1.1% and 0.12% of its weight above 823 K (about in the range of the second peak). Therefore it is clear that the second peak is not due to framework dehydroxylation. 118 F. Niu, H. HolZrnann /Applied Catalysis A: General 128 (1995) 107-118 References [ 1 ] W.M. Meier and D.H.

Three different zeolite catalysts (USY-zeolite, H-ZSM5 and H-mordenite) were investigated at normal pressure under various experimental conditions with the disproportionation of ethylbenzene (EBD) as test reaction and nitrogen as inert gas. By means of the physical properties, IR-measurement and TPD-measurement, the experimental results could be explained sufficiently.
