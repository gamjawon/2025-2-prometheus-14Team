Graphical abstract Recently, the interface catalysis has caused more and more attentions. Herein, we developed an approach to strengthen the boundary role of Pd/CeO2 catalyst, resulting in an obvious increase in its catalytic performance for CO oxidatio n with 100% CO conversion at 20°C. The results show that after the pretreatment in N2 at 750°C and reduction in H2 at 300°C, the interaction between Pd and CeO2 was enhanced, and smaller Pd0 particles and longer interface length (I0) of Pd-CeO2 were obtained. In the boundary of Pd-CeO2, the presence of Pd2+ promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in CeO2, and CO adsorbed on Pd0 reacts with the oxygen species activated by the oxygen vacancy. The Pd0 sites and oxygen vacancies in the boundary play a decisive role in the CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2, which is proved by the B-TOF and I0 ×B-TOF. Keywords Pd/CeO2 CO oxidation High temperature treatment Boundary effect B-TOF 1 Introduction The Pd/CeO2 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were widely studied in recent years, because of their outstanding activity and stability [1–6]. When CeO2 was used as a support of precious metals, the metal-support interaction would induce the synergistic oxidation/reduction of both the metal and support, resulting in an increase in their catalytic performances in wide applications, especially for CO oxidation [1–3]. Concerning the reaction mechanism for CO oxidation over supported catalyst, it is generally believed that the reaction takes place at the metal-support interface [7], thus the interfacial effect has attracted much attention in recent years. Many researchers have investigated the effect of the palladium loading on the catalytic activity of Pd/CeO2 [8,9]. The results show that the catalytic activity is connected with the Pd loading, but it is not the only relevant factor, because there is a perfect content in the certain conditions rather than the activity is certainly increased with the increasing of Pd content. The geometric structures of ceria support and the synergy between the Pd species and ceria also play an important role in CO oxidation [4,9–12]. To improve the interaction between Pd and ceria and further enhance their synergy effects, a lot of methods have been applied. (1) The appropriate preparation methods were adopted. Li et al. [8,9] prepared Pd/CeO2 catalyst by improving protocol and one-pot co-precipitation method, and showed that the catalysts exhibited the promising activity for low-temperature CO oxidation. Using the solution-combustion method, the PdO/Ce1-xPdxO2-δ catalyst containing free surface PdO species and PdO species in Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution was obtained, and the synergetic effects of surface free PdO species and Ce1-xPdxO2-δ solid solution led to facile reaction of CO and O2 [7,13]. The hollow Pd-CeO2 nanocomposite spheres and cage-bell Pd@CeO2 nanoparticle aggregates were prepared by means of template synthesis, in which Pd was highly dispersed in the catalysts, so that there is larger Pd-CeO2 interface [10,14], resulting in the higher catalytic activity for low-temperature oxidation of CO. Besides, other preparation methods such as pulsed laser ablation, plasma-arc, sol-gel precipitation and microemulsion were also used [11,15–17]. (2) Utilizing the exposed crystal facets of CeO2 with different morphologies regulates and controls the interactions with the supported Pd species [18–22]. For instance, we described that the structure and chemical state of Pd supported on ceria were affected by ceria facets, thus influencing its catalytic activity [4]. (3) Treatment with different atmosphere and temperatures was used to improve the interaction between Pd and ceria [1,3,5,10,11,23]. Hinokuma et al. [1] found that after Pd/CeO2 was aged at 900°C in air, its catalytic activity increased by more than 20 times for ambient-temperature CO oxidation, despite of a significant sintering and loss of the surface area from 92 to 7m2/g. Some researchers utilized XPS and other analysis methods to investigate the state of Pd species and the interaction between Pd and ceria, certifying that the perfect interaction could be obtained at certain temperature and in the atmosphere of oxygen [12,23]. Wang et al. [3] treated the catalysts in static air and H2/O2 alternating flow at 800°C respectively, and found that the catalytic activity of the redox treated catalyst was seriously weakened compared with the oxidative-treated one, due to the encapsulation of Pd crystallites by the CeO2 support during the redox treatment. In this paper, we focused on the study of the role of boundary or interface catalysis in the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, and how to enhance the role of boundary between Pd and ceria phases by the treatment in flowing N2 gas at different temperatures, followed by reduction in H2. This results in a stronger interaction between Pd and ceria and higher dispersion of Pd species on ceria, which improves its catalytic activity and stability for CO oxidation remarkably. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation PdCl2 (AR) and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (AR) was purchased from Shanghai Titanchem Co., Ltd. CeO2 was obtained by direct calcination of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O in static air at 350°C for 2h. The Pd/CeO2 catalysts with different Pd loadings were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. The calculated amount of PdCl2 was dissolved in 2mL solution of 0.1M HCl, and then 2g prepared CeO2 was added in the PdCl2 solution under ultrasonic treatment for 1min and dried at 60°C overnight. Before characterization and catalytic activity testing, the catalysts were thermally treated in the flowing N2 for 2h and reduced in H2 for 1h online. In the “catalyst-T/N-T/H” sample, T is the treatment temperature (°C), and N or H indicates the N2 (99.999%) or 10% H2/N2 gas. 2.2 Evaluation of the catalytic activity The catalytic activity of the catalyst for CO oxidation was tested in a fixed bed quartz tubular reactor (ID=4mm) with 200mg catalyst after 10min of steady operation. Before testing activity, the catalyst was treated at 500–800°C in N2 (20mL/min) for 2h and reduced in 10% H2/N2 at 300°C for 1h (20mL/min). The reactant gas was consisted of 0.15% CO/Air (50mL/min) and the space velocity was 15000mL/(h·gcat). When the catalytic activity was tested in the presence of moisture, the reactant gas passed through a water vapor saturator, and varying the temperature of the saturator could adjust the water concentration in the reactant gas. The CO concentration was analyzed online by a gas chromatograph (GC 2060) equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID), in which a methanizer was used for hydrogenating CO and CO2 to methane. The CO conversion (XCO) was calculated by XCO (%)=([CO]in −[CO]out)/[CO]in ×100, where [CO]in and [CO]out are the CO concentration of the inlet and outlet gas, respectively. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated by TOF=(XCO·VCO·NA)/Nα [4]. And the boundary-turnover frequency (B-TOF) of the CO oxidation was used to indicate the catalyst activity, which means the molecule number of CO oxidized per second per Pd0 atom in the boundary between Pd particle and CeO2. That is to say, B-TOF was calculated on the Pd sites in the boundary rather than on all Pd sites on the whole surface. We assumed that the Pd particle is hemispherical and the Pd-Ce interface is the circle geometry [4,24–26], thus B-TOF is calculated by B-TOF=(XCO·VCO·NA)/Nβ [26], where XCO is the CO conversion, VCO is the CO gas flow rate (mol/s), NA is the Avogadro constant and Nα is the number of catalytically active sites (Nα =Nt·DPd) on the surface, Nt is the total amount of Pd atoms, Nβ is the Pd0 atoms in the boundary between Pd particle and CeO2 (Nβ =VPd/(0.5×(4/3)π·(d/2)3)×(πd/2r)=6VPd/(d2 ×r)),VPd is the total volume of Pd particles (VPd =Nt·((4/3)·π·r3)), d is Pd average particle diameter (d=1.12/DPd) [4], r is the radius of the Pd atom, which is 0.137nm [27]. The total length of the perimeter of the Pd−Ce interface (I0) was also calculated (I0 =Nβ ×2r). TON=B-TON=Nα ×TOF=Nβ ×B-TOF. The specific kinetic rate rCO/I0 (mol/(m·s)) based on the length of Pd-CeO2 interface I0 was calculated by rCO/I0 =(XCO·VCO)/I0 [24,25]. The Pd dispersion (DPd) was measured by H2-O2 titration [28–31], the catalyst was oxidized in air (20% O2/N2, 20mL/min) at 300°C for 1h, and then it was cooled down to 120°C and He (20mL/min) was swept the catalyst bed for 30min to eliminate the physically adsorbed O2. Subsequently, H2 pulse was introduced to the sample. Based on the reaction stoichiometry of Pd+1/2O2 →PdO and PdO+3/2H2 →PdH+H2O, DPd was calculated by DPd =Nα/Nt =((2/3)·V0 M·NA)/(22400NA·WP)=3.167×10−3 ×V0/(W·P), where V0 is the adsorption volume of hydrogen (mL), W is the weight of the sample (g), P is the mass percentage of Pd in the sample (wt.%), and M is the molar mass of Pd (106.4g/mol). 2.3 Catalyst characterization The Pd content in the catalyst was obtained by an inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) on a PerkinElmer Optima 7000 DV instrument. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were tested on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MRD X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ=0.154056nm) operated at 40kV and 40mA. The surface areas of the samples were measured by N2 adsorption at −196°C on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020M+C adsorption apparatus. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope (FEI Corporation) operated at 200kV. In situ XPS spectra were obtained on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi, and survey spectra were recorded with the pass energy of 160eV, and high resolution spectra with the pass energy of 30eV. The base vacuum during XPS analysis was greater than 10−6 kPa. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated with the C 1s line (284.6eV) originating from carbon. All the samples were treated online. For the Pd/CeO2 sample, it was treated in N2 (20mL/min) at 750°C for 1h, and after cooling down to 30°C in N2 in the reaction chamber, the sample was transferred to the analysis chamber by a transfer rod under ultra-high vacuum, then the XPS spectra of Pd/CeO2-750/N were taken. After that, this sample was moved to the reaction chamber and reduced in 10% H2/N2 (20mL/min) at 300°C for 1h, and after cooling down to 30°C in 10% H2/N2, the sample was transferred to the analysis chamber, then the XPS spectra of Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H was obtained. After the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst was treated in the reaction chamber in the gas of 1.5% CO/N2 (5mL/min) at 30°C for 30min, the sample was moved to the analysis chamber, and then the XPS spectra of CO adsorbed on the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst were obtained. When the reactant gas of 0.15% CO/Air (50mL/min) was used instead of 1.5% CO/N2 (5mL/min), the in situ XPS spectra of the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst after the surface reaction of CO oxidation were obtained. The nonlinear curve-fitting process of Pd 3d, Ce 3d and O 1s was performed by the XPSPEAK 4.1 software package with a Shirley background and a convolution of Lorentzian-Gaussian functions (80/20). In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra was performed at 30°C on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector, and the spectral resolution was 4cm−1 with scanning 64 times. The sample of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N was reduced at 300°C for 1h in 10% H2/N2 (20mL/min), and after cooling down to 30°C in 10% H2/N2, N2 was used instead of 10% H2/N2. After 10min the background IR spectrum was collected, and then 1.5% CO/N2 (5mL/min) was used to replace N2 and the in situ IR spectra of CO adsorbed on 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H at 30°C were obtained. When the reactant gas of 0.15% CO/Air (50mL/min) was used instead of 1.5% CO/N2 (5mL/min), in situ IR spectra of the surface reaction of CO oxidation over the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst were obtained. Temperature-programmed desorption of CO adsorbed on the catalyst (CO-TPD) was carried out in a quartz micro-actor equipped with a quadruple mass spectrometer (QMS, Balzers OmniStar 200). The catalyst (0.2g) was in situ treated at 750°C in flowing N2 for 2h and then reduced in 10% H2/N2 at 300°C for 1h. After pure CO flow (10mL/min) was introduced through the catalyst bed at 30°C for 40min to reach the saturated adsorption, He (20mL/min) swept the catalyst bed for 3h to eliminate the physically adsorbed CO. Then the sample was heated in He (20mL/min) from 30 to 650°C at 10°C/min. The mass signals of CO (m/z =28) and CO2 (m/z =44) were recorded. 3 Results and discussions The Pd loadings (wt.%) in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts measured by ICP-OES were equal to 0.38, 0.72, 2.1 and 3.4, respectively. In the XRD patterns of Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalysts with different Pd contents in Fig. 1 A, the diffraction peaks of CeO2 support were observed clearly, and the diffraction peak corresponding to the Pd could not be observed although the Pd loading reached 3.4wt.%, indicating the highly dispersed amorphous or small palladium nanoparticles. As shown in Table 1 , with the increase in the Pd loading, the Pd dispersion (DPd) decreased and the total length of the Pd-Ce interface (I0) increased, in which I0 of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H was much longer than others. It can be seen from Fig. 1B that the particles of CeO2 were uniform with a mean size of 10nm before treatment. The crystallites of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2 have somewhat grown up to 20–30nm after the treatment at 750°C in N2 (Fig. 1C), and the CeO2 size hardly changed after the followed reduction in H2 (Fig. 1D). We also calculated the CeO2 size by the Scherrer equation: D=(k·λ)/(β½·cosθ) and the result as 21.6nm, which is consistent with the result of TEM images. In the TEM images of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (Fig. 1D–F), we can observe the CeO2 (111) facets based on the lattice fringe of 0.32nm. The palladium particles size distribution was shown in Fig. 1D, and the average particle size was calculated to be proximately 2.08nm. The Pd(111) facet can be observed in Fig. 1E (the rectangular area) and F (the lattice fringe of 0.23nm), and further demonstrated by the Fourier-transformation figures (Fig. 1G).[23] As shown in Fig. 1E, the size of Pd particles is about 2nm, which is consistent with the results obtained by dPd =1.12/DPd [4]. In the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H with different Pd contents (Fig. 2 A), most of Pd existed as Pd0 at BE=∼335.5eV, and a fraction of Pd was Pd2+ at BE=∼337.0eV. As shown in Table S1, with the increase of the doping content, the surface concentration of Pd0 (and Pd2+) increased, and when the Pd loading was increased from 2.1wt.% to 3.4wt.%, the surface concentration of Pd increased few. In 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H, the surface amount of Pd2+ was higher than other samples, resulting in its higher catalytic activity for the CO oxidation [6]. In the O1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2B), the peaks at BE=529.2–529.8eV is assigned to lattice oxygen in ceria and the one at BE=∼531.5eV is to adsorbed oxygen on the surface, such as hydroxide [3,8,9,32]. With an increment in the Pd loading, the position of O1s peak slightly shifted to lower BE, and when the Pd loading was 2.1wt.%, its surface lattice oxygen peak exhibited the lowest BE (529.28eV), indicating the oxygen species is rich in electron and more active. Thus, it is easier to react with the adsorbed CO, resulting in higher activity [33]. In the Ce 3d XPS spectra of Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (Fig. S1), the peaks of vo, uo, v′ and u′ are corresponding to Ce3+, and the peaks of v, u, v″, u″, v‴, u‴ to Ce4+ species [4,34,35]. The surface fraction of Ce3+ (based on the total surface Ce) can be determined by Ce3+ =Ce3+/(Ce3+ +Ce4+), which is correlated to the surface oxygen vacancies [4]. The oxygen vacancy is an expression for the ability of the ceria-based catalyst activating oxygen species, and play an important role in low-temperature CO oxidation [9,36,37]. The results in Table S1 show that the oxygen vacancy fraction (%) on the catalysts exceeded 40%, and 0.38wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (43.0%)<0.72wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (43.9%)<2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (46.9%)<3.4wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (49.6%), which is different from the results of Li et al. [9] They proved that the surface amount of Ce3+ decreased with the increase of Pd content, but we demonstrated the charge exchange from the Pd species to surface Ce4+ during the high temperature treatment in flowing N2 and reduction in H2, thus producing abundant oxygen vacancies. However, varies evidence indicated that CeO2 itself can also react with hydrogen, and form oxygen vacancy. [38,39] In order to compare with the effect of Pd, the oxygen vacancy fraction (%) of CeO2-750/N-300/H was also analyzed by XPS as a standard. It can be seen from Table S1 that the oxygen vacancy fraction (%) of CeO2-750/N-300/H was only 28.8%. These XPS results show that the Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalysts with different Pd contents have complex interaction between Pd species and ceria. Because the presence of Pd2+ promotes the formation of the surface oxygen vacancies, indicating that the activity of Pd/CeO2 catalyst is not only determined by the Pd content, but also by the synergy between Pd and ceria. The effect of the calcination temperature in N2 on the surface element statuses of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2 was investigated by XPS, and the results (Fig. 2C,D) show that for the precursor without any treatment, the Pd 3d5/2 peak at BE=337.64eV might be ascribed to Pd2+ in PdCl2 [9], and after calcination in flowing N2 at 750°C, this Pd2+ peak shifted to higher BE (∼338.0eV), resulting in the higher ionization of Pd species, due to the electron exchanging at the Pd–CeO2 interface to form the −Pd2+-O2−-Ce4+- linkage during calcination at higher temperaturec [12,13]. The peak at BE=∼338.0eV should be ascribed to highly oxidized PdO2 or the surface Pd-ceria interaction phase PdxCe1-xO2-δ. Since the PdO2 species is unstable at high temperatures and the intensity of adsorbed oxygen (Oad) is very low (Oad/Ola =0.094, Table S1), the peak at ∼338.0eV is corresponding to PdxCe1-xO2-δ more reasonable [6]. In PdxCe1-xO2-δ, the individual Pd2+ ions can locate in the ceria lattice because of the electron transferring from Pd to the support [40–42], resulting in strong interaction between Pd and CeO2, and the interaction becomes strongest at the treatment temperature of 750°C. When the calcination temperature was increased to 800°C, the precursor PdCl2 was decomposed to metal Pd, thus destroying the PdOCe interaction [1], and its BET surface area (16.0m2/g) decreased obviously compared with that (28.8m2/g) of the sample calcined at 750°C in N2 (Table S2). After reduction in H2 at 300°C, Pd2+ was translated to Pd0, a small quantity of Pd2+ species still existed (Fig. 2C), because the Pd2+ species could not be completely reduced [3,10] and existed at the interface between Pd0 particles and ceria, which can strengthen the interaction between Pd and ceria [4,12,13]. Note the lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, and Ce3+/(Ce3+ +Ce4+) (surface oxygen vacancy fraction) are increased on the catalyst-750/N-300/H sample, compared with the sample of catalyst-750/N (Fig. S2, the oxygen vacancy fraction increases from 0.206 to 0.469). This is because that in the reduction progress, Pd2+ was reduced to Pd0, and the Pd0 sites adsorbed hydrogen to produce β-PdH, the excess hydrogen species on the Pd0 particles transferred to the surface of ceria by spillover and united with the lattice oxygen atom of CeO2 to produce H2O and the water dissociated to hydroxyls [2,4,43], From Fig. 2D, we can also observed an interesting phenomenon that the amount of surface lattice oxygen increased after reduced in H2, it may be expressed that the migration of bulk oxygen to surface happened during the reduction progress. The effect of Pd content on the activity of Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H for the CO oxidation is shown in Fig. 3 A. It shows that the Pd loading significantly affects its catalytic activity. With an increase in the Pd loading, its catalytic activity was increased and then decreased, and when the Pd content was 2.1wt.%, this catalyst exhibited the highest activity, that is, CO was completely converted to CO2 at 20°C. As shown in Fig. 3B, the N2 treatment temperature affected greatly its catalytic activity and the catalyst treated in flowing N2 at 750°C exhibited the best activity. If this catalyst was treated in static air at 750°C, its catalytic activity would decrease obviously, compared with the 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst. To further prove the effects of the Pd loading and the treatment temperature in N2 on the catalytic activity of Pd/CeO2, the TOF, B-TOF, TON, and rCO/I0, I0 ×B-TOF values were calculated in Tables 1 and 2 , and plotted in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4A, 0.38wt.% Pd/CeO2 (d=1.67nm) has the highest TOF value (0.00318s−1) and the highest Pd dispersion (66.9%), but its catalytic activity is the lowest, due to its lowest loading of Pd; 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2 has the highest catalytic activity and its TOF is only 0.00261s−1. This is because that the catalytic activity of Pd/CeO2 is not only associated with the dispersion but also with its Pd loading. That is to say, the catalytic activity is not only related to the individual Pd atoms (TOF), but also to the total number of Pd atoms on the surface (TON). Thus the highest TON of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H (d=2.09nm) is corresponding to its highest catalytic activity for CO oxidation. However, many researchers thought that every exposed surface Pd atoms is not the same for the contribution of catalytic activity. The role of the interface in supported metal/oxide catalysts has been realized by more and more researchers, which can not only stabilize effectively metal nanoparticles, such as Pt/CeO2 [44,45], but also can adjust the catalytic performance [46,47]. Generally, TOF is calculated on the basis of all surface metallic atoms, but many surface atoms are inactive. Therefore, C.M. Kalamaras et al. [24,25] have reported a specific kinetic rate rCO/I0 (mol/(m·s)) based on the length of Pd-CeO2 interface, I0. Later on, we have also proposed the turnover frequency on the basis of the active sites in the boundary or interface, defined as B-TOF [26]. As the amount of B-sites is less than that of the surface active sites, the B-TOF value is remarkably larger than TOF value. As shown in Fig. 4A, the rCO/I0, B-TOF and I0 ×B-TOF values are larger than others when the particle size is 2.09nm, corresponds to the sample of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H, which indicates that the Pd atoms in the boundary of Pd-CeO2 play a decisive role in the catalytic reaction. When the 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2 catalyst was treated at different temperature, the Pd2+ peak shifted to higher BE with the increasing of treatment temperature (Fig. S3), resulting in the higher ionization of Pd species and stronger interaction between Pd-CeO2, but when the calcination temperature increased to 800°C, the precursor PdCl2 will decompose to metal Pd, thus destroying the PdOCe interaction. So the sample of 2.1wt% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H has the highest TOF, rCO/I0, B-TOF and TON, I0 ×B-TOF (Fig. 4B). If it was treated in air at 750°C, its TOF, rCO/I0, B-TOF, TON, I0 ×B-TOF are lower. The results above show that the treatment temperature and atmosphere can remarkably affect the interaction between Pd and ceria, resulting in the change in its catalytic performance. Fig. 3C expresses that with an increase in the moisture concentration in feed gas from normal (3∼10ppm) to rich-moisture (3.1%) condition, the catalytic activity of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H deceased obviously. Under the normal condition (3∼10ppm H2O), this catalyst could keep a high activity (>97% CO conversion) at 30°C for ∼20h, and then its activity slowly decreased to 90% after 30h of the reaction (Fig. 3D). When the reaction temperature was risen to 40°C, its catalytic activity (>96% CO conversion) was hardly deceased after 120h of the reaction. Under the rich-moisture condition (3.1% H2O), the reaction temperature (T100) of 100% CO conversion was about 40°C (Fig. 3C,D), and after 50h of the reaction at 40°C, its CO conversion slightly decreased to 95%. When increasing the temperature to 60°C, 100% conversion of CO could keep above 15days (about 360h). These results show that the 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H catalyst presents an excellent activity and stability under rich-moisture condition. The activity in several cycles over the 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H was tested, which was showed in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that the activity remained stable in the cycle 1, 2 and 3, and decreased gradually in cycle 4 and 5, which indicated that the catalyst of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H has a good cycling activity. In situ XPS spectra after adsorbing CO and the surface reaction of CO oxidation are shown in Fig. 2E,F. After the adsorption of CO, the Pd peaks shifted to lower BE (0.35∼0.38eV), indicating that the charge of CO was moved to Pd0 and the formation of the Pd0-CO chemical bond. The intensity of lattice oxygen peak at 529.28eV declined, and a new peak emerged at 528.70eV (Fig. 2F), illustrating that a part of lattice oxygen on the surface may become semi-stable, due to the attraction of adsorbed CO [33], because the adsorbed CO combine with the lattice oxygen at low temperature [24,48]. Furthermore, a new peak of CO-Pd0 liner adsorption can be observed at 336.1eV [49], which is consistent with in situ DRIFT spectra (Fig. S4). After 30min of the surface reaction of CO oxidation, the peak of Pd2+ at 337.72eV strengthened, and the peaks of CO-Pd0 and Pd0 shifted to higher BE (Fig. 2E). This is because that O2 was activated by oxygen vacancy to form O2 − by the help of the charge of Ce3+ moving to O2 while Ce4+ obtained the charge from Pd0 [48]. Most of the activated oxygen species (O2 −) can react with the adsorbed CO, a fraction of them oxidizes Pd0 nearby the interface, resulting in an increase in Pd2+ peak at 337.72eV and formation of the O2 2− (or O−) species. In the O 1s XPS spectrum after CO+O2 (Fig. 2F), the peak at 528.70eV disappeared, while a new peak at 532.05eV emerged and could be ascribed to adsorbed O2 [3] (may be O2 − species), and the peak at 530.50eV may be corresponding to the O2 2− species activated by oxygen vacancy [48,50]. These results show that when O2 was added, COad mainly reacted with oxygen species activated by oxygen vacancy instead of lattice oxygen in ceria, thus CO oxidation could occur at lower temperature [48]. In in situ DRIFT spectra of 2.1wt.% Pd/CeO2-750/N-300/H in the flowing gas of 1.5% CO/N2 (Fig. S4A), the absorption peak at 2090cm−1 can be ascribed to COad on Pd (111) facet, [49,51] and the peak at 2170cm−1 is corresponding to the vibration absorption of linearly adsorbed CO-Pd2+, and the peak at 1970cm−1 is to isolately bridged COad on Pd0. [3,4,16] The peak at 1580cm−1 is ascribed to the unidentate carbonate species, and the peaks at ∼1056 and ∼1300cm−1 are to the bidentate carbonate species [3,4,49]. The downshift of 1295cm−1 peak may be due to changes in the carbonate species coverage as the function of time [49,51,52]. When the feed gas (0.15% CO/Air) was used instead of CO/N2 (Fig. S4B), the IR absorption spectra are hardly changed, except for the disappearance of the peak at 2170cm−1, because the Pd2+ ions can be readily reduced by CO [4], resulting in the decrease in the linearly adsorbed CO-Pd2+. But the above conclusion seem to contradict the XPS results (Fig. 2E), which clearly demonstrated that Pd2+ species still existed and the amount of Pd2+ even increased after CO/O2 adsorption. It can be suggested that the Pd2+ ions are located at the interface between the Pd0 particles and ceria, and the oxygen vacancies may exist just nearby [48]. Hence, after pouring O2 into the catalyst, they were activated by oxygen vacancies and adsorbed around the Pd2+ ions as O2 2− or O2 − species, which hindered the adsorption of CO on the Pd2+ sites. In the CO-TPD-MS spectra (Fig. S5A), there are two desorption peaks of CO2 at 92∼155°C (top temperature), shows the reaction of two kinds of COad with the surface oxygen to form CO2, which is verified by two desorption peaks of CO at similar temperatures (Fig. S5B). Unlike the CO2 desorption curves for other samples, two peaks (α, β) of the 2.1wt.% Pd sample were obviously overlapped and the top temperature of α peak was as low as 92°C, and a little desorption peak of CO2 at ∼62°C was observed also. Unlike the 2.1wt.% Pd sample, other three samples have only a little desorption peak of CO and not the CO2 peak at ∼62°C, because these weaker COad on the 2.1wt.% Pd sample has reacted with the surface oxygen to form CO2 at ∼62°C. The research results above show that, the oxygen vacancies play a key role in the CO catalytic oxidation, and the oxygen vacancies mainly generate in the Pd-CeO2 interface or boundary, thus, the interface length is an important parameter. The pretreatment of N2 can strengthen the interaction between Pd-CeO2, resulting in the formation of smaller Pd0 particles during the reduction in H2 to form longer I0. CO mainly adsorbed on Pd0 and COad reacts with the oxygen species activated by oxygen vacancies in the Pd-CeO2 boundary, which is similar to the dual sites (Pd0 and Ce3+) mechanism [48]. There are other ways of CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2, CO and O2 may be co-adsorbed on the Pd0 nanoparticles and react with each other to produce CO2, but the energy barrier is much larger than that CO oxidation by O2 adsorbed at Pd-CeO2 boundary, so the latter is the mainly process in this catalytic oxidation [48]. The mainly process of CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2 can be depicted as Scheme 1 , and expressed Eq. (1)–(5), in which O2 was activated by obtaining “e” in the oxygen vacancy to form highly reactive superoxide O2 −. (1) O2 +Ce3+-(e)→O2 − +Ce3+ +() (2) 2CO+2Pd0 →2Pd0-CO (COad) (3) COad +O2 − →CO2 +Pd0 +O− (4) COad +O− →CO2 +Pd0 +e (5) Ce3+ +()+e→Ce3+-(e) Where, the () represents the oxygen vacancy, the CO oxidation mainly occurs in the boundary of Pd-CeO2. In the CO oxidation, we found that there are the peroxide O2 2− species adsorbed on the Pd2+ sites, thus the O2 2− species would react with CO adsorbed as Eq. (6)–(9). (6) O2 − +Pd0 +Ce3+ +()→Pd2+ +O2 2− +Ce3+-(e) (7) COad +Pd2+ +O2 2− →CO2 +O− +Pd+ (8) COad +Pd+ +O− →CO2 +Pd0 (9) O2 +Ce3+-(e)→O2 − +Ce3+ +() If there is moisture in the feed gas, H2O can adsorb and dissociate into two OH− in the oxygen vacancies, thus the O2 activation would be hindered, resulting in the decrease in the activity. [24,43] 4 Conclusion In summary, high-temperature treatment of N2 can affect the interaction between Pd and CeO2, which leads to the formation of smaller Pd0 particles to form longer interface length (I0) of Pd-CeO2 after reduction of H2. In the interface of Pd-CeO2, the presence of Pd2+ promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 and in favor of forming the active oxygen species. For the Pd/CeO2 catalyst, the Pd0 sites and oxygen vacancies in the boundary play a decisive role in the CO oxidation, which is proved by the B-TOF, rCO/I0 and I0 ×B-TOF. In CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2, CO mainly adsorbed on Pd0 and O2 was activated by obtaining “e” in the oxygen vacancy in the Pd-CeO2 boundary, and then COad reacts with the oxygen species.

        "dc:description": "Recently, the interface catalysis has caused more and more attentions. Herein, we developed an approach to strengthen the boundary role of Pd/CeO2 catalyst, resulting in an obvious increase in its catalytic performance for CO oxidatio n with 100% CO conversion at 20°C. The results show that after the pretreatment in N2 at 750°C and reduction in H2 at 300°C, the interaction between Pd and CeO2 was enhanced, and smaller Pd0 particles and longer interface length (I0) of Pd-CeO2 were obtained. In the boundary of Pd-CeO2, the presence of Pd2+ promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies in CeO2, and CO adsorbed on Pd0 reacts with the oxygen species activated by the oxygen vacancy. The Pd0 sites and oxygen vacancies in the boundary play a decisive role in the CO oxidation over Pd/CeO2, which is proved by the B-TOF and I0 ×B-TOF.",
