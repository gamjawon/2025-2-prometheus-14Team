Dauscher and G. Maire Laboratoire de Catalyse et Chimie des Surfaces, URA 423 du C.N.R.S., Universite Louis Pasteur, 4 rue Blaise Pascal, 67070 Strasbourg (France) (Received January 29, 1991; accepted April 3, 1991) Abstract The isomerisation and hydrogenolysis reactions of 2- and 3-methylpentanes, n-hexane and methylcyclopentane have been studied on platinum catalysts supported on physical mixtures of Ti02 and Ce0z, in the atomic ratios of 4, 1 and 0.25. The results have been compared to reference Pt/r'02 and Pt/Ce02 catalysts. Particular care was taken on the study of the influences of catalyst pretreatments and metal loadings. Pt/fi02 catalysts are extremely sensitive to each factor with regard to catalytic activity and selectivities, while Pt/Ce02 catalysts are less influenced. Synergistic effects on activity have been observed for the 2 wt.0/b Pt/fi02-Ce02 catalysts as compared to Pt/T'02 or Pt/Ce02 catalysts treated under similar conditions. Explanations have been put forward taking into account electronic and geometric factors, particularly chlorine effects. Introduction The use of mixed oxide systems such as vanadia-titanic or vanadia-titania-silica has attracted great interest this last decade since the discovery of their improved selectivity for the selective catalytic reduction of NO_, by ammonia [1, 2]. At the moment, little attention has been devoted to the study of titanic-ceria systems prepared either via a sol-gel process or via a simple physical mixture. In a previous paper [3], we have reported the characterization of Ti02-CeO2 supports by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The principal observation was the stabilization of the + 3 oxidation state of Ce in the presence of Ti0z, mainly for sol-gel prepared supports. This means that strong interactions between Ti02 and Ce02 take place, as with VZO6-T1O2 systems [4, 5]. This Ce3+ oxidation state is maintained in the presence of platinum. On the other hand, Ti02 and Ce02 are individually reducible and both can therefore lead to the formation of so-called strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) after reduction at high temperatures [6], when used as supports. Nevertheless, the nature of the SMSI is thought to differ according to the support. It is interesting to see which phenomenon will predominate when using different Ti02/CeOz ratios. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 260 This paper deals with skeletal rearrangement reactions of hexanes on Pt catalysts supported on various physical mixtures of Ti02-CeO2 to determine whether mixing the two oxides would lead to specific catalytic behaviours or simply to an arithmetic mean of behaviours of Pt/Ti02 and Pt/Ce02 catalysts. If the latter is true, this would mean that the specific interactions observed by XPS between Ti02 and Ce02 [3] would have no effect on catalytic activities and selectivities. The influence of (i) the proportion of each support, (ii) the metal loading and (iii) the catalyst pretreatment has been studied. Experimental The physical mixtures of Ti02-CeO2 supports were prepared with the following starting materials: - Ti02 (Tioxide), 98% anatase, 2% rutile, specific area: 46 in' g-I, pore volume: 0.5 cm' g-1 - Ce02 (Rhone-Poulenc), 100% fluorite, specific area: 130 m2 g-1, pore volume: 0.05 to 0.2 cm3 g-'. These were mixed together, ground and sieved. The atomic proportions of support prepared were: Ti02(80)-CeO2(20), Ti02(50)-CeO2(50) and Ti02(20)-Ce02(80). These three mixed supports, as well as the reference supports Ti02 and Ce02, were impregnated with H2PtC16 .- 6H20 solutions at the appropriate concentrations in order to obtain weight Pt percentages of 2 and 8. The chloroplatinic solution (2 em' per gram of support) was added dropwise to the support, followed by thorough mixing. The catalysts were then put directly in an oven at 120 C and dried under air for 16 h, stored under air and dried again at 120 C just before use. In order to observe the pretreatment effects, the catalyst samples were either reduced under hydrogen at 200 C for 16 h or calcined under air at 400 C for 4 h followed by 16 h reduction under hydrogen at 200 C. These pretreatments were performed under a flow of 50 cm' min- I gas at atmospheric pressure in situ in the catalytic apparatus already described; [ 7 ]. In the text, the catalysts will be named by their wt.% Pt followed by R (reduced) or by CR (calcined-reduced), i.e. 2RPt/, 2CRPt/, 8RPt/ or 8CRPt/support (Table 1). We have no direct evidence about the distribution of platinum, for instance whether distribution is uniform on the two oxides of the physical Ti02-Ce02 mixtures. Nevertheless, some assumptions have been made to explain the catalytic results (see Discussion). The hydrocarbons used, namely 2-methylpentane (2MP), 3-methylpentane (3MP), n-hexane (nHx) and methylcyclopentane (MCP), were Muka puriss grade. Pulses of 3 Al of hydrocarbon were passed over the catalyst at constant pressure (2MP: 4. torr, 3MP: 3 torr, nHx: 2 torr, MCP: 1 torr). Several consecutive experiments were made.and, in each run, part of the reaction mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography over a 5 m X 1/8 in column of DC 200/fire brick. No noticeable change in activity or selectivity was detected over the entire range of experiments ( - 30).

Results The total activity, expressed as the number of moles of hydrocarbon having reacted per second and per gram of metal is reported in Fig. 1 (units: mol g-' s-' X 10-s) for the four hydrocarbons studied on the different catalysts. Generally speaking, the overall variations in activity observed as a function of the different factors studied (metal loading, pretreatment) are quite similar whatever the starting hydrocarbon. On closer examination, the specific activities of the various hydrocarbons follow the order: MCP > 3MP = 2MP > nHx, which is also the order obtained with Pt single crystals and Pt/A1203 catalysts (8, 91. The RPt/Ti02 reference catalysts present roughly the same catalytic activities as the RPt/Ce02 reference catalysts, whatever the metal loading. Moreover, the activities of the 8RPt catalysts are quite similar to those obtained with the 2RPt catalysts. These two facts seem to indicate that the initial accessible sites are the same whatever the metal loading in this range 262 30 30 o eo 20 Q X 20 o _T _T 10 Z 10 G V N N ~~,r~r,~,r~ii it ,,r r ._m,ri 100 80 50 20 0 0 8R '100 80 50 20 0 Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 0 8CR I Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 nHx 2C MCP R 30 20 20 X a 0 10 10 .U `a a JAI ~ .I 100 80 50 20 0 100 80 50 20 0 % Ti02 in TM-Ce02 % Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 Fig. 1.

Influence of the catalyst pretreatments (reduction R: Hz, 16 h at 200 C or calcination-reduction CR: air, 4 h at 400 C followed by H2, 16 h at 200 C) and metal loadings (2 or 8 wt.% Pt). of concentrations when Pt/Ti02 or Pt/Ce02 catalysts are not calcined. Calcination pretreatment effects are a function of the support and the metal loading. It has a beneficial effect for the 2CRPt/Ti02 catalyst, while no influence is observed with the 8CRPt/Ti02 one (except with nHx). For the 8CRPt/Ce02catalyst, a beneficial effect is also observed on calcination, while the reverse is obtained with 2CRPt/Ce02. The precalcined 2CRPt/Ti02 catalyst is the most active. On studying the catalysts supported on the Ti02-CeO2 physical mixtures, it is seen that for the 8RPt catalysts, an increase in the amount of ceria in the support leads to a decrease in the catalytic activity. Contrarily, a synergistic effect is observed for the 2RPt catalysts, the maximum activity for these catalysts being attained for 2RPtai02(50)-Ce02(50). The calcination pretreatment has only a slight effect on the activity of the Pt/Ti02-CeO2catalysts, except for 8CRPt/Ti02(20)-Ce02(80) which is activated by a factor of roughly 7. The addition of 20% Ce02 to Ti02 leads to the most active precalcined 2CRPt/Ti02-CeOz catalyst. The selectivity in Cs hydrocarbons S, expressed as the percentage of C6 molecules formed upon overall conversion, is reported in Fig. 2 for the four hydrocarbons studied. No formation of benzene or cyclohexane was observed at our working temperatures. 263 2MP 100 0 100 N 80 0 N .C 60 T 100 T 3MP 100 80 50 20 0 N 8R / Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 El SCR 2R 2CR nHx 0 =~ 100 N ao 0 2 5 60 T 40 d 20 100 80 50 20 0 / Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 MCP 100 80 50 20 0 100 80 50 20 0 / Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 / Ti02 in Ti02-CeO2 Fig. 2. Percentage selectivity in C6 hydrocarbons for 2MP, 3MP, nHx and MCP. Experimental conditions as in Fig. i. With MCP as starting hydrocarbon, the selectivity is high whatever the catalyst and the pretreatment. The lower selectivities obtained are due to an enhancement of the exocyclic C-C bond ruptures. Only one C-C bond is broken at a time. For the other hydrocarbons, the selectivity depends on the catalyst used. The RPt/Ti02 catalysts present high selectivities (60 < ss'oS < 80), lower ones being observed for the 2RPt catalysts. The 2MP selectivity drops after calcination from 80 to 50% for 8CRPt catalysts and from 65 to 25% for 2CRPt ones. For Pt/Ce02 catalysts, the selectivity is equal to 40% whatever the treatment and the metal loading. The Pt/Ti02-CeO2 (80-20) and (50-50) catalysts behave quite like Pt/ Ti02 catalysts, except 2RPt ones whose selectivities are lower, while the behaviour of Pt/Ti02(20)-CeO2(80) catalysts resembles that of Pt/Ce02. The intrinsic selectivities of the hydrocarbons vary in the following order: MCP > 3MP = 2MP > nHx. The hydrogenolysis products formed with the acyclic hydrocarbons, namely propane, n- and isobutane, n- and isopentane, also result from only a single C-C bond breaking. No products, such as methane or ethane, issuing from multiple bond cleavage are observed. We have also focussed our attention on the type of C-C bonds broken, taking into account the proposal of Anderson [10] which distinguishes bond cleavage involving tertiary or quaternary carbon atoms (iso-mode hydrogenolysis) from that involving primary or secondary carbon atoms (CZ-mode hydrogenolysis). We observed that for Pt/Ce02 catalysts, when 2MP is used 264 as starting hydrocarbon, the rupture ratio is nearly statistical (iso/Cz mode of hydrogenolysis = 1.5). This value exhibits a slight tendency to decrease when the proportion of titania in the support increases, especially for amounts equal to or greater than 80'0 (iso/CZ = 1.2 0.1). For 3MP, the variations in the iso/C2 mode of hydrogenolysis ratios are not important, whatever the catalyst and the pretreatment (iso/CZ = 0.5 0.1). It is nevertheless interesting to note that this ratio is far from the statistical value of 1.5, due in particular to the predominant formation of isopentane over that of n-butane.

Comparison of the isomer ratios obtained either via isomerisation of 2MP, 3MP and nHx or via hydrogenolysis of MCP. Experimental conditions as in Fig. 1. 265 primary-secondary C-C bond ruptures are therefore favoured, while this is not the case for 2MP as starting hydrocarbon. Figure 3 reports the ratios between the acyclic isomers obtained from isomerisation of each of the three acyclic hydrocarbons, and the corresponding ratios obtained from hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane. One of the most striking results is that the variations in the ratios as a function of metal loading and pretreatment are identical whether starting from an acyclic hydrocarbon or from methylcyclopentane, but less pronounced. Another important point is that the formation of the branched chain hydrocarbon is always favoured with regard to the formation of n-hexane for the 8RPt catalysts, when 2MP or 3MP is used as reactant. This effect becomes increasingly important as the concentration of Ti02 in the support is raised. For Pt/Ce02 catalysts, no effect is observed. We have also noted that the presence of methylcyclopentane in the product distribution is always greater with nHx than with 2MP or 3MP, whatever the catalyst. Discussion One of the most interesting results of this study is that the metal loadings and the pretreatments have no effect on the catalytic selectivities of Pt/Ce02 catalysts, while important effects on activity and selectivities are observed with Pt/Ti02 catalysts. This means that, even after a reduction step at low temperature (200 C) where strong metal-support interactions are still not efficient [6], Ti02 and Ce02 used as supports may interact differently with the metal. Both supports are reducible, but a major difference is their ability to retain chlorine. The affinity of Ce02 for chlorine (from H2PtC16 . 6H20) is well known. The Ce/Cl ratios observed by XPS increase from 1.0 to 1.8 as the Ce02 content in Pd-Ce02/AI203 catalysts varies from 0.3 to 12.3; a cerium oxychloride phase CeOCI has even been observed by XRD analyses [ 11 ]. Moreover, Pt/Ti02-CeO2 catalysts from which supports are prepared by a sol-gel process catalytically behave quite similarly to Pt/physical mixtures of Ti02 and Ce02. These catalysts exhibit increasing amounts of surface chlorine as the percentage of Ce02 in the support increases [3]. For instance, after catalytic reactions carried out on precalcined catalysts, the CI/Pt ratios observed by XPS are 1.2 and 1.8 for Pt/'n02(80)-CeO2(20) and Pt/ Ti02(20)-Ce02(80) catalysts, respectively. On the other hand, on Pt/Ti02 catalysts, only small amounts of chlorine can be detected by XPS after catalytic testing (Cl/Pt = 0.3) [ 12 ]. The catalytic results obtained with Pt/Ce02 catalysts can be explained, as proposed by Kili [13] for Pd/Ce02 catalysts, by the presence of chlorine in a bridge position at the interface between Pt particles and Ce02 grains. In order to obtain the maximum of these interactions, we can assume that the particles have a raft-like shape. The Pt-Cl-Ce bonds would be strong enough to hinder sintering or dispersion of the Pt particles after various pretreatments, especially for low metal loadings. On the other hand, when 266 chlorine does not interact with the support, the dispersion of Pt particles after calcination would be favoured, as is the case for the 8CRPt/Ce02 catalysts for which the initial amount of chlorine is greater than for 2CRPt catalysts. Moreover, the presence of chlorine in the neighbourhood of platinum could explain the unusually low selectivities in C6 hydrocarbons (S=40%) obtained with the acyclic isomers compared to those obtained with Pt/A1203 (S=60%) catalysts [9], by inducing an electronic effect on platinum. 'Fri et al. have shown that when the electrophilic character of platinum in PtY zeolites is enhanced by the addition of certain elements, higher hydrogenolysis activities for n-butane are obtained [ 14 ], corroborating our results. On the other hand, the selectivities remain high with MCP (Fig. 2), suggesting that either the activation energy required to break a ring C-C bond is higher than that needed for a C-C bond in a linear pr branched-chain hydrocarbon, or that the adsorption sites are different for hydrogenolysing the MCP and the acyclic hydrocarbons: metallic and electron-deficient platinum for MCP and acyclic hexanes, respectively. The first hypothesis seems more probable, since the C-C ruptures which are disfavoured with MCP (mainly CZ-C3, see hydrogenolysis ratios in Fig. 3) are also disfavoured with the acyclic hexanes (low iso/CZ modes of hydrogenolysis), independently of the adsorption sites. We have ruled out any acidic effect that can be induced by the presence of chlorine, as well as any bifunctionality effects. The Ti02, Ce02 and Ti02-CeO2 supports have been tested in the reactions of hexanes: neither skeletal isomerisation nor hydrogenolysis reactions were observed when the reaction temperature was lower than 400 C. Only double-bond migrations were obtained at 255 C on the supports. The supports can therefore be considered as inactive for skeletal isomerisation and hydrogenolysis reactions in our working conditions. On the other hand, no measure of any number of acidic centres was performed. Nevertheless, some experiments were performed with 2-methyl-2-pentene to test whether the acidity induced by the presence of chlorine plays a role in the catalytic activity. This hydrocarbon reacts at the same rate and leads to the same product distribution as does 2-methylpentane, indicating that no acidic mechanism can be involved in our reactions, whatever the catalyst studied. The calcination of 8Pt/Ti02 catalysts has little effect on activity but causes a decrease in the selectivity in Cs hydrocarbons as well as a great change in the isomer product distribution (Fig. 3), especially for hydrocarbons possessing a tertiary carbon atom. This means that there is no modification in the number of accessible Pt atoms but that the nature of the adsorption sites and thus the reaction mechanisms are changed. Two mechanisms of isomerisation have been postulated to operate with hexanes: a hydrogenolysis-recombination mechanism (bond-shift mechanism) [ 15 ] and a 1-5 cyclisation (leading to MCP)-hydrogenolysis mechanism (cyclic mechanism) [ 16 j. The rates of the 2MP- 3MP and 3MP- 2MP reactions are diminished by a factor 4, indicating that the sites where these reactions occur are blocked or transformed into hydrogenolysis sites after a calcination-reduction pretreatment. The fact that the 3MP/nHx and 2MP/nHx ratios obtained by 267 hydrogenolysis of MCP follow the same trend as those obtained from acyclic isomers confirms that MCP is a reaction intermediate for this type of reaction. Nevertheless, the ratios observed with the acyclic hydrocarbons are higher than those obtained with MCP, indicating that part of branched-chain hexanes is also obtained via a bond-shift mechanism. It is mainly this mechanism that is affected by the calcination pretreatment. Another behaviour is observed with regard to calcination with the 2Pt/ Ti02 catalysts. They exhibit activity enhanced by at least a factor of 3, while the selectivity in C6 hydrocarbons is cut in half. However, the product distribution remains roughly unchanged. The 2Pt catalysts are always less selective than their 8Pt homologues. We can assume, according to the catalytic results and to the literature, although no chemisorption or TEM analyses were carried out, that calcination of 2Pt/Ti02 catalysts enhances the dispersion of the catalyst. The number of hydrogenolysis sites is increased, while the reaction mechanisms remain unchanged at the isomerisation sites. This could be explained by assuming that hydrogenolysis reactions occur near the Pt-support interface, while isomerisation reactions more readily occur on `bulk' platinum. Similar effects of calcination have been observed with Rh/ Si02 [171 and supported Ru catalysts [18). Moreover, it is well known that the hydrogenolysis reactions are favoured in the presence of small platinum ensembles [ 191. We can also assume that after calcination, the very small Pt particles are close to the support so that Pt-O (support) bonds could be formed. Oxygen being more electronegative than chlorine, platinum would be more electron-deficient in Pt/ri02 than in Pt/Ce02 catalysts, thus leading to more hydrogenolysis reactions. The presence of electrodeficient platinum particles in our catalytic systems would enhance (i) the catalytic activity, (ii) the hydrogenolysis reactions and (iii) the exocyclic C-C bond rupture of MCP. The latter effect has already been observed with Pt- Ce/A1203 catalysts and has also been attributed to the presence of electron-deficient platinum particles induced by cerium in the + 3 oxidation state [201. In the case of `small' particles deposited on Ti02, hydrogenolysis reactions can be explained both by electronic effects (electron-deficient Pt) and/or geometric effects (small metallic ensembles). These two effects can be cumulative, explaining why more hydrogenolysis reactions can occur on Pt/Ti02 catalysts than on Pt/Ce02 catalysts, on which only electronic effects can play a role. Let us now look at the results obtained with Pt catalysts supported on physical mixtures of Ti02 and Ce02- We shall only deal with activities and global selectivities. There is no direct linear relationship between the relative proportions of Ti02 and Ce02 in the Ti02-CeO2 systems and the reference supports. Moreover, for each proportion of mixed supports, the results are influenced by the catalyst pretreatment and the metal loading. The use of mixed Ti02-CeO2 supports has an inhibitory effect for the 8RPt catalysts. They become less and less active as the percentage of Ce02 in Ti02-CeO2 increases, while the reference catalysts both present similar and higher activities. After a calcination-reduction pretreatment, the 8CRPt catalysts behave similarly to the references when 20ss'o of one support material 268 is replaced by the other one. For equal quantities of Ti02 and Ce02 [Ti02(50)-Ce02(50)], a small inhibitory effect is observed but the value of the activity is much more like that of Pt/Ti02. On the contrary, for 2Pt catalysts, synergistic effects are observed for both R and CR catalysts when supported on physical mixtures of Ti02 and Ce02, especially when the amount of Ce02 is not too great. Nevertheless, the only reduced catalysts exhibit the most important inhibitory or synergistic effects, whatever the metal loading. The occurrence of these two contradictory effects is inconsistent with simple surface area criteria. The question is: how can the behavior of the metal explain these discrepancies and what are the consequences? We have already observed that Ce02 is reduced under the electron beam in X-ray analyses, even in physical mixtures of Ti02-CeO2 where only longrange interactions can occur. This reduction takes place only in the presence of Ti02, although a very minor effect in our experimental conditions could arise from the direct interaction of the X-ray beam with Ce02 itself, as shown by Paparazzo [ 21 ] and already observed in our laboratory. With Ti02-CeO2 supports prepared via a sol-gel process, where Ce02 is close to Ti02 in the same granull of support, the reduction of Ce02 is still predominant [3]. One can suppose that the reduction of a rare earth is even easier in the presence of large amounts of metal, when the catalysts are reduced only. Moreover, the amounts of chlorine remaining at the surface are greater. For 8Pt catalysts, either sintering or site-blocking of platinum particles could explain the inhibitory effects. Sintering could be due to strong Ti02-Ce02 interactions that would generate very large particles, jointly deposited onto the two supports, which is aided by the high amount of platinum. Another explanation is that Pt particles adsorb similarly on Ti02 and Ce02. Nevertheless, chlorine still remaining on Pt/Ti02 would attract Ce02, leading to Ce02 migration onto the Pt particles and thus to a decrease in activity. This could explain why when the amount of Ce02 in the Ti02-CeO2 supports is much higher, the activity decreases. This is confirmed by the fact that in the absence of Ti02, the activity of Pt/Ce02 catalysts is similar to that of Pt/Ti02 catalysts. Moreover, the quite linear decreases in selectivity between Pt/Ti02, Pt/ Ti02-CeO2 and Pt/Ce02 catalysts corroborates this assumption. After a calcination pretreatment, chlorine is removed from Ti02 and therefore no migration of Ce02 can occur, leading to an equal repartition of platinum on Ce02 and Ti02. The same is true for 2Pt catalysts, which are always more active than 8Pt ones. The interactions of Ti02 with Ce02, in the absence of large amounts of chlorine, generate small electron-deficient metallic ensembles, especially when the amount of Ce in the + 3 oxidation state (and not in interaction with chlorine) at the surface is high. This is confirmed by the fact that the most active catalysts are also the most hydrogenolysing. Calcination would stabilize the + 3 oxidation state of cerium, and thus enhance the activity when small amounts of Ce02 are added to Ti02 supports. On the other hand, after reduction at higher temperatures (400 C), when strong metal-support interactions are efficient, the 2 wt.% Pt/Ti02-CeO2 catalysts present an even 269 higher synergistic effect in comparison with Pt/Ti02 catalysts [22]. This confirms the beneficial role of the use of mixed Ti02-CeO, supports for low-load platinum catalysts in reforming reactions. Conclusion The study of the isomerisation and hydrogenolysis reactions of hexanes with Pt/Ti02, Pt/Ce02 and Pt/Ti02-CeO2 catalysts has revealed that the support has a great influence on catalytic activities and selectivities. Moreover, for each catalyst, the metal loading and the pretreatment play an important part. This study has demonstrated that: (1) the presence of chlorine is an important factor with Pt/Ce02 catalysts, affecting the dispersion and the electron-deficient character of the platinum particles for 8- and 2-loaded catalysts, respectively. Low selectivities in C6 hydrocarbons are found with both catalysts. (2) calcination pretreatment of a 8Pt/Ti02 catalyst leads to a decrease in reactions occurring via a bond-shift mechanism on comparison with reduction pretreatment alone, while for 2Pt catalysts, new hydrogenolysis sites are created. (3) inhibitory and synergistic effects occur when using Ti02-CeO2 supports with 8- and 2-loaded platinum catalysts, respectively. The former is explained by the migration of Ce02 onto Pt/Ti02 sites, induced by the presence of chlorine, and the latter case by Ti02-CeO2 interactions leading to small electron-deficient metallic ensembles. These effects are more pronounced when the catalysts are not calcined before reduction. One of the most interesting results of this study is the fact that mixing Ti02 and Ce02 supports does not lead to a simple additive behaviour of each component. On the other hand, appropriate pretreatment conditions lead to better reforming catalysts than Pt/Ti02 or Pt/Ce02 alone. References 1 H. Bosch and F. Janssen, Catal.
