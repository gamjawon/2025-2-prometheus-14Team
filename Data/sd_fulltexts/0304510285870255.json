ELLISON, A. K. COVERDALE and P. F. DEARING School of Science, Humberside College of Higher Education, Cottingham Road, Hull, North Humberside (U.K.) Summary The catalytic activity of unsaturated esters over Re207/alumina decreases with molecular complexity, methyl-4-pentenoate > methyl-10-undecenoate > methyl erucate. The activity of each ester increases with Re207 loading, and in general shows a maximum at a particular Re207 content depending upon the surface characteristics of the alumina. A combination of techniques used to study the structure of the catalysts shows the prevalence of clusters of rhenium oxide on the surface and the in- fluence of pore structure and surface area of the support on catalyst activity. Speculations are presented on the nature of the rhenium oxide aggregates. Introduction Perhaps one of the most exciting applications of the metathesis reaction is the catalytic metathesis of alkenes containing functional groups. Since the pioneering work of Boelhouwer et al. [I], catalyst systems have been devel- oped for olefins substituted with various polar functional groups [2]. Rhenium oxide on alumina is of particular interest in the heterogeneous catalytic reaction. With a co-catalyst of tetraalkyi tin, the system causes the metathesis of unsaturated fatty acid esters producing materials of commercial value [2, 3]. Mechanistic schemes have been proposed [4] for these reactions and a variety of techniques have been used to evaluate the structure and reactivity of the catalysts [5-8]. Nevertheless, recent studies [9,10] reveal that the structural and topological dependence of the reaction is more com- plex than has been supposed. The work reported here presents a further systematic study of the cata- lytic activity of rhenium oxide supported on several aluminas in the meta- thesis of unsaturated acid esters, and speculates on the structure of the supported material and on the molecular factors affecting catalytic activity. 0304-5102/85/$3.30 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 142 Experimental Materials \"/-Alumina Four aluminas were used as supports. Each alumina was ground, sieved and calcined in a stream of dry air for 6 h at 525 C before use. This treat- ment produced 7-alumina in each case, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Table 1 gives details of these aluminas with respect to textural characteristics. TABLE 1 Details of the aluminas used as supports Alumina Supplier Condition Surface area Pore Pore Impurities (m2 g~1) radius volume (nm) (cii^g-') Al-V Ventron 3.2 mm pellets 91 4.3 0.21 0.2% Na Al-L Laporte ultra-pure, 157 6.5 0.47 20 ppm Na crystalline boehmite Al-D Degussa powder 102 Al-A Akzo Chemie powder 186 4.4 0.40 < 0.01% Na Ammonium perrhenate This was supplied by Aldrich as 99.999% NH4ReC>4 with the typical impurity levels, 5 ppm Si, Fe, Mg and Cu. Methyl-4-pentenoate and methyl-10-undecenoate These materials were supplied by Fluka and Aldrich respectively as the pure, 99% acids. After conversion to their methyl esters by a Fischer-Speier method [II], the products were purified by vacuum distillation, deoxygen- ated with nitrogen and stored over molecular sieve 5A in a dry nitrogen at- mosphere. Methyl erucate This was provided by Croda Chemicals Ltd, and after fractional distilla- tion and GC analysis the ester was purified and stored as above. Catalyst preparation Calculated amounts of ammonium perrhenate solution and 7-alumina were slowly evaporated to dryness with constant stirring, the resulting solids being dried at 110 C for 2 h. Before use, each catalyst was calcined in dry air at 525 C for 2 h and subsequently activated in dry, oxygen-free argon (< 1 ppm 02) at 525 C for 2 h. By this method, catalysts were prepared with nominal Re^O^ loadings in the range 2.5 - 30% Re207. 143 In addition, a number of catalysts were prepared from Al-A which had previously been treated with aqueous solutions of HC1, HF, NHLiF, (N114)2- HP04 or NH3, according to the following procedure. Al-A (20 g) was stirred with an aqueous solution (100 cm3) of the pretreatment electrolyte (0.10 mol dm\"3) for 4 h at approximately 50 C. After recovery, the modified Al-A was washed, dried at 110 C for 2 h and calcined at 525 C in dry air for 6 h. These modified aluminas were used to prepare catalyst precursors containing 10% nominal Re^O-, and calcined by the procedures described above. Catalysts are coded in the text as, for example, 15-A1-V, where 15 refers to the percentage Re^O^ loading and Al-V refers to the particular alumina used as a support. The term 'nominal % Re^O^' used in the text refers to the theoretical loading produced during the impregnation procedure. Rhenium analysis The rhenium content of the catalysts was estimated through the use of neutron activation analysis by the Physics and Radio isotope Service, ICI Petro- chemicals Ltd., Billingham, Cleveland, England. All catalysts have been anal- ysed in this way after calcination. It should be noted that all rhenium contents are quoted as% w/w Re207, regardless of the molecular state of the rhenium. Metathesis experiments All metathesis reactions were carried out in a liquid-phase batch reactor [12], rigorously excluding water vapour and oxygen during all stages of pre- paration and reaction. Reagents were added by means of a silicone rubber septum, and chlorobenzene was used as the diluent/solvent. Catalyst activity Reaction mixtures were carefully sampled and analysed by standard gas chromatographic methods [12]. The metathesis reactions of methyl-4-pent- enoate and methyl-10-undecenoate were also monitored by measuring the volume ofethene produced at constant pressure, using a gas-syringe technique [12]. Perrhenate adsorption The ability of various support materials to adsorb ammonium perrhenate from aqueous solution was measured in acidic, basic and neutral conditions for Al-V, Al-L, Gasil-35 silica and silica-alumina (13% and 25% Al;^) using isotopically labelled ('^Re) perrhenate solution. ^Re has a half-life of only 3.7 d and therefore preliminary experiments were carried out with labelled (32?) phosphate solutions to develop and evaluate the appropriate experi- mental technique. 10.3 mC of '^Re was obtained as perrhenic acid in 2.2 cm3 of 3.0 mol dm\"3 nitric acid (equivalent to 2.8 mg cm\"3 Re) from the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, England. To allow for isotopic decay and thus maintain the count rate at an optimal level during the course of the experiments, the amount of '^Re added to the stock solutions used for the adsorption studies 144 was gradually increased from 0.09 cm3 to 0.33 cm3 per 100 cm3. Using this method, stock solutions were prepared (0.2 and 0.001 mol dm\"3) from which working solutions of strength 0.1, 0.005, 0.001 and 0.0001 mol dm\"3 were prepared by dilution. Radioactive decay count rates were measured on 5 cm3 aliquots of test solution using a well-scintillation counter in association with a Nuclear Enterprises Scalar Timer, model ST6. Calibration of the linear relationship expected between count rate and perrhenate ion concentration was estab- lished by gradual precipitation of perrhenate ion with nitron solution (10% w/v nitron in 5% aqueous acetic acid). During the adsorption experiments, 20.0 cm3 of labelled ammonium perrhenate solution were stirred with 1.0 g alumina (accurately weighed) for 15 min and then centrifuged for 5 min. 5.0 cm3 of the supemate were counted using 5.0 cm3 of the original solution as a reference to allow for the isotopic decay during the experiment. The initial pH of the perrhenate solution was adjusted to the required value with ammonia or acetic acid solutions. Net count rate loss, L (C min\"1) by precipitation during calibration was calculated from: 20 + V L= -20-^-^ for 20.0 cm3 of labelled perrhenate solution and, for the adsorption experi- ments the amount of perrhenate adsorbed, A (mol g~1), was calculated from: C, -Ct 20 P A = r LX X Cr 1000 W where V (cm3) = volume of nitron solution added Cr = mean count rate of reference solution ^ = mean count rate of test solution P (mol dm\"3) = original strength of the perrhenate solution W (g) = weight of sample Fast-atom bombardment secondary-ion mass spectrometry, FABMS Secondary ion mass spectra were obtained [9] by courtesy of SIMS Consultancy Ltd., UMIST, England, using a Vacuum Generators Analytical MM12-12S quadrupole mass spectrometer system, capable of unit resolution over the mass range 1 -1200 m/e. Argon, fast-atom bombardment was used as the primary beam, current density 10~7 A m~2, beam area 4 mm2. Spectra were optimised using a low energy (2 kV) atom-ion gun, final analyses being obtained for both positive and negative secondary-ion spectra using a high energy (4 kV) atom gun. Spectra were obtained at both high and low resolu- tions, the latter being necessary to locate the naturally low-intensity, high- mass fragments. Pre-calcined, air-dried and model compounds were presented to the primary beams as non-compacted powders. 145 Surface acidity-basicity Surface acidity was measured for both calcined catalysts and supports by a modification ofJohnson's method [13]. 5 cm3 of dimethyl yellow solu- tion (2.3 mg dm\"3 in chloroform) were added to an accurately weighed sample of catalyst or support (0.1 g), and the suspension was shaken vigor- ously. The red colour which developed on the surface of the solid was titrated with n-butylamine solution (0.1007 mol dm\"3 in chloroform) over a period of 10 - 15 min, again with vigorous shaking. Surface basicity was measured by the following method. 5 cm3 of thymolphthalein (1.3 g dm\"3 in dry chloroform) was added to 0.1 g of the sample and, after vigorous shaking, the resulting orange colour was titrated with benzoic acid solution (0.100 mol dm\"3 in chloroform). The end-point was referenced to an over-titrated sample of the same weight. Isoelectric point The method of Jiratova [14] was used to measure the isoelectric points of freshly calcined aluminas and several contrasting, potential support materials, Gasil-35 silica and silica-alumina (13% and 25% A1203). 1.0 g portions of sample were added to a series of buffer solutions of known pH value and the pH change, ApH, was measured after equilibration. Equilibra- tion time increased with both increasing particle size of the support and decreasing pH of the buffer solution, except in the neighbourhood of the iso- electric point where equilibration was virtually instantaneous. X-ray powder diffraction Data were collected for finely-ground powders using a Phillips Raymax camera, diameter 11.48 cm, and employing Cu Ka nickel-filtered radiation at a tube voltage of 36 kV and current 20 mA. Surface area and pore-size distribution Values of specific surface area and pore-size distributions for the supports and a number of calcined catalysts were obtained through nitrogen volumetric adsorption at 77 K using a manual apparatus or a Carlo Erba Sorptomatic 1800 Series automatic analyser. Results and discussion Isoelectric point The isoelectric point IEPS of a solid placed in an electrolyte corresponds to the pH value at which the surface is electrically neutral. Since negatively charged ions in solution will be adsorbed onto the surface at pH values below the IEPS and positively charged ions at higher pH values, some discrimination may be made regarding the expected behaviour of the support with respect to NH4Re04 adsorption during catalyst preparation. The data obtained for the four calcined 7-aluminas and for comparison silica and silica-aluminas 146 AP\" AP\" Fig. 1. Isoelectric points of support materials.

The derived IEPS values are summarised in Table 2.

The 'normal' method of catalyst preparation employs more or less neutral solutions of ammonium perrhenate and therefore, for the aluminas, the results indicate that adsorption of Re04~ would be expected to occur in acidic solution. Adsorption in neutral solution is unlikely to occur, especially when it is realised that the addition of the alumina to the neutral solution produces an increase in the pH of the solution. ReO^ adsorption For the impregnation technique used here and elsewhere to prepare the catalysts it is supposed that Re04~ ions are adsorbed onto the support surface. This primary adsorption process should have occurred before the remainder of the Re04~ in solution was deposited on the alumina as the water solvent was progressively removed. The results of the adsorption experiments using '^Re-labelled NH4Re04 are shown in Fig. 2 for alumina samples and summarised in Table 3 for alumina and silica-based supports. Fig. 2. Relationship between the amount of '^ReC^\" adsorbed from aqueous solutions of Re04~ ([Re04~] expressed in mol dm\"3) for the supports: 0 Al-V (acid solution)-^ Al-L (neutral solution); and A Al-L (acid solution). Only minimal adsorption of Re04~ took place for silica and silica-alu- minas, and for alumina in basic solution. The unusually large Re04~ adsorp- tion observed for Al-V at 0.2 mol dm\"3 Re04~ in acidic solution may be ascribed to the bulk crystallisation or deposition of NH4Re04 on the support, as this solution strength was close to the maximum solubility of NH4Re04 (0.227 mol dm\"3). 148 TABLE 3 Adsorption of '^Re-labelled Re04~ from aqueous solution by various support materials Support pH [Re04-]a (mol dm 3) Amount of Re04 (molg-1) adsorbed Al-V 2.10 0.0001 0.41 2.04 0.001 8.3 2.27 0.001 3.5 2.11 0.01 47.8 2.13 0.05 29.9 2.15 0.2 2.15 0.2 511 7.16 0.0001 6.76 0.001 6.96 0.01 3.2 7.16 0.2 10.10 0.001 0.42 A1-L 2.10 0.0001 0.94 2.04 0.001 15.3 2.27 0.001 14.4 2.11 0.01 81.5 2.13 0.05 122 6.76 0.001 1.7 6.96 0.01 7.5 6.80 0.2 4.2 10.10 0.001 0.16 Gasil 35 2.27 0.001 1.4 6.76 0.001 10.10 0.001 Si~(13%)Al 2.27 0.001 1.5 6.76 0.001 10.10 0.001 0.45 Si-(25%)Al 2.27 0.001 1.8 6.76 0.001 10.10 0.001 \"Concentration of Re04 in solution. In acidic or neutral solution, the amount of Re04~ adsorbed increased with increasing concentration of the ReC^\" solution and eventually reached a plateau. The maximum amount of adsorbed Re04~ (122 mol g~1) was observed for A1-L in acidic solution, and corresponded to a maximum loading due to adsorption from solution of 3.1% w/w Re04~ or 3.0% w/w Re^0^. This value of adsorption capacity is not in accordance with that loading, 12% RG^O-J on Al-A, estimated by Olsthoom and Boelhouwer [15] to correspond to coverage of the alumina by a monolayer of Re^O-,. It would appear that primary adsorption of rhenium species occurred on only a small fraction of the available surface of the alumina. 149 TABLE 4 Details of Re^O? loading and alumina pretreatment Support M esh size Pretreatment % Re^Oy\" % Re2071' Al-V > 300 20.4 12.5 100-300 - 19.3 12.7 30 - 100 - 5.0 4.8 30 - 100 - 10.1 9.8 30 - 100 - 15.3 12.3 30- 100 - 20.4 12.4 30 - 100 - 22.5 12.5 Al-L > 170 - 2.6 1.6 > 170 - 5.0 4.8 > 170 - 7.6 7.0 > 170 - 10.1 9.4 > 170 - 12.7 11.3 > 170 15.2 13.3 > 170 - 17.9 15.7 > 170 20.4 17.7 30 - 100 - 20.5 18.6 Al-D - 4.9 4.7 - 10.0 9.5 - 20.3 12.3 Al-A > 170 - 5.0 4.9 > 170 - 10.1 9.7 > 170 - 15.2 14.0 > 170 - 20.4 17.4 > 170 HC1 10.2 7.9 > 170 HF 10.1 9.8 > 170 NH4F 10.1 8.3 > 170 (NH4)2HF04 10.2 10.1 > 170 NHa 10.0 9.5 \"Theoretical content before calcination. ''Content after calcination. Catalyst preparation The normal process of impregnation with ammonium perrhenate solu- tion was observed to cause considerable aggregation of the alumina particles, and was particularly noticeable for the smaller particle sizes of the support (sieve mesh > 100). Usually the state of aggregation was 'loose' but, for cata- lyst precursors prepared from Al-D, the aggregation was extensive and inter- particle binding was strong. Table 4 shows the full range of catalysts prepared and details their nominal and actual loadings, expressed as % w/w Re20-7. Values of actual Re20.7 content were measured after the air/argon calcination treatment at 525 C. For sample 22.5-A1-V (30 -100 mesh) the dried catalyst possessed an actual loading of 22.1% Re2C>7 compared with a nominal loading of 22.5% Re2C>7. It would appear therefore that quantitative deposition of NHi4Re04 150 was achieved during the impregnation procedure and that the nominal values of Re^O-, content prior to calcination do have a significance. After calcination and below about 10% Re207 loading for all aluminas, good correspondence was achieved between the nominal and actual Re i0^ contents. Above this value the correspondence become poorer presumably because supported material was lost through sublimation-decomposition during calcination, as indeed was observed. The results show clearly that each support only retained a finite amount of Re^O-, at 525 C, the amount depending upon the nature of the support, viz. Al-V ~- 12.5%, Al-L ^ 18%, Al-A ^ 17.5%, Al-D = 12.5% Re2C>7. Similar data for the nominal 10% Re^O-, catalysts prepared from pre- treated Al-A (> 170 raesh) (Table 4) again show that good correspondence was in general achieved between the nominal and actual loadings. However, for Al-A pretreated with HClor Nl^F abnormally low, actual Re207 loadings were observed for the calcined material. Finally, the amount of Re207 retained on any alumina after calcination appeared to be little affected by the support particle size. During impregnation in the neutral/basic solution less than the absolute maximum (3% Rey,0^ would be adsorbed. For all catalysts, the material deposited in excess of this value must reside on the surface by forces other than those responsible for primary adsorption. Surface area and porosity Although a detailed analysis of the nitrogen adsorption data is reported elsewhere [16], a number of results can usefully be discussed here. The aluminas Al-V, Al-L and Al-A all showed adsorption isotherms of Type IV [17] and therefore can be said to possess pore structures in the mesopore range. For Al-D, however, the isotherm was clearly Type II indi- cating that the material was essentially non-porous. The values of specific surface area and the results of pore-size analyses where appropriate for these supports and calcined catalysts are given in Table 5. The isotherms observed for the catalysts were not altered sufficiently to change the overall type, remaining basically Type IV or Type II after the adsorption of Re04~ and subsequent calcination. That is, catalysts prepared from mesoporous alumina were themselves mesoporous and non-porous alumina produced essentially non-porous catalysts. Nevertheless, substantial changes in surface area and porosity character- istics were observed for the Re2C>7-loaded supports. Two related, but apparent- ly contrasting, trends are evident for those aluminas possessing mesoporosity. As the Re i0^ loading increased, the nitrogen specific surface area first in- creased and then either reached a plateau (Al-L) or subsequently decreased (Al-V), while the total pore volume decreased. The maximum adsorption of 3% Re^O-f which apparently satisfies the solution adsorption capacity of Al-L is insufficient to 'cover' the surface with a monolayer of adsorbed material, and sensibly one supposes that the sites of Re04~ adsorption were unevenly spread over the available alumina 151 TABLE 5 Surface characteristics of alumina supports and catalysts Material Mesh range\" Nominal Ref>^ content (% w/w) Specific surface area (n^g-') Total volun (cm3 P< nee~ ~>re') Pore diameter (nm)3 Al-V pure support 91 0.21 8.6 30 - 100 5.0 96 0.20 6.6,9.6 30 - 100 10.1 85 0.16 7.8,13.4 30-100 20.4 85 0.18 6.2,8.4 Al-L pure support 157 0.47 12.8 > 170 5.0 175 0.36 10.6 > 170 10.1 177 0.34 9.4, 11.2 > 170 20.4 177 0.30 10.2 30 - 100 20.5 130 0.38 9.2,13.0 Al-A pure support 186 0.40 8.8 > 170 10.1 188 0.35 8.8 Al-D pure support 102 b b > 170 4.9 101 b b > 170 10.0 95 b b \"The reported pore diameter values are at the maximum or maxima in the appropriate pore-size distribution plot. ^ype II isotherm, pore analysis inappropriate. \"This refers to the mesh size of the sieved material, large particles having a low value of mesh range. surface. The observed increase in nitrogen surface area even at the low loading of 5% Re2C>7 suggests that the supported Re2C>7 was contributing a new ad- sorption surface to the adsorptive. That is, the Re207 was present as multi- layer 'islands' or 'clumps' on the alumina, at least some of which must occur in the alumina mesopores to explain the simultaneous decrease in total pore volume. With increasing loading the pores of Al-L were progressively and perhaps selectively filled, reducing the pore volume still further but not con- tributing to an increase in Re^C^ area and hence total surface area. This model is consistent with the observed changes in pore diameter (Table 5) and shape of the pore distribution plots [16]. The clumps of Re2C>7, even at 5% Re^O-,, are of sufficient size to possess their own surface area and pore structure. The behaviour of the materials based on Al-V aids this interpretation. Here, for this lower surface area alumina, the specific surface area fell dramatically after the initial increase at 5% Re207. The pore distribution plots [16] show two separate pore structures at higher Re207 loadings and, as seen in Fig. 3, the adsorption and desorption branches of the isotherms show discontinuities in the relative pressure range P/Po = 0.6 to 0.9, especially for the large particle, granular materials, behaviour indicative of the development of a second, overlapping pore structure [18] associated here with Re207. 153 The isotherms for Al-V and its related catalysts were also different in the highest pressure region, the catalysts showing a final up-tum in adsorption and high-pressure hysteresis. The catalysts prepared from Al-D, having essen- tially the Type II isotherms for 'non-porous' materials again show high-pres- sure hysteresis which is characteristic of pore structure. The data suggest that Re2C>7 condensed in the voids between the particles of the support alumina. This Re2C>7 existed in a 'loose' state of aggregation with a separate, probably macropore, structure thus binding the alumina particles together. To support these contentions one should note that the maximum amounts of Re207 retained on the aluminas are observed to follow in the same order as the total pore volume, L > A > V (> D), and that there is no correspondence with nitrogen surface area. Surface acidity-basicity The nature of the surfaces of both supports and catalysts, with respect to the total surface basicity or total surface acidity, is shown in Fig. 4. Several comments are necessary to clarify the data and the ensuing discus- sion. Fig. 4. Surface acidity (mmol H\"*\" g~1) or basicity (negative values) as a function of It,eyp^ loading for catalysts prepared from the following supports: 0 Al-L; n A1-V;V Al-A; and 0 Al-D. As large amounts of Re207 were sublimed from Al-V and Al-D catalysts, their data are plotted as a function of the nominal Re207 content rather than the actual % Re207 relevant to Al-L and Al-A catalysts. All of the four pure 7-aluminas were basic, although Al-D was almost neutral, with the decreasing order of basicity Al-L > Al-V =: Al-A > Al-D. All of the catalysts showed an increasingly acidic surface as the Re207 loading increased. 154 The acidity of Al-D catalysts was higher throughout the range of Re207 loading than Al-L or Al-A catalysts, and Al-D was the only support to pro- duce an acidic catalyst at 5% Re^ loading. Above 5% RQ^O-J the acidity of Al-V catalysts was large, perhaps because of the larger particles of this material which retained the adsorbed indicator in an anomalous manner. However the extra acidity of the Al-D series may well be due to the state of aggregation of the catalyst brought about during sample preparation. Indeed disintegration of the agglomerates considerably reduced the acidity due to the exposure of fresh alumina surface, the effect being greatest at the higher Re^0^ loadings. Catalysts from A'-L and Al-A (both > 170 mesh) show roughly similar variations with Re207 content. Slightly 'S'-shaped plots were obtained with an approximately linear region above about 10 -12.5% RezC^. Al-D shows a similar linear region above 10% Re207. In this linear region there is some correlation between the increment of increasing acidity and the increment of increasing Re^O-, loading, if the latter is expressed as perrhenic acid HRe04, as though all the additional Re207 is titratable. The deposition of the first few per cent of Re^C^ appears to have had the least effect on the surface acidity-basicity up to approximately 6% for Al-A and 3 - 4% Re2C>7 for Al-L. This suggests that either the Re207 was trapped within the pores of the support or that there was strong support-rhenium interaction. As the loading was increased further, but before the linear region is attained, an apparently abnormal rise in total acidity is observed, as though more than two acid sites were being created for each Re207 molecule or, perhaps more rationally, as the combined result of an increasing availability of Re207 and Re207-surface titration of the support hydroxyl groups. Final- ly, a sharp rise in surface acidity occurred as the support particle size decreased, a consequence of the exposure of fresh alumina surface or of a greater support-rhenium interaction. These data relate to the meso- and macro-porous structure of Re207 clumps already discussed but perhaps more importantly, as will be described, the activity of the catalyst apparently depends upon the catalyst surface acidity. X-ray powder diffraction X-ray powder patterns of supports and catalyst materials were compared with those of relevant pure compounds and with the data from the ASTM Index system. In the X-ray patterns obtained from the catalyst precursors in the Al-V and Al-D series, the NH4Re04 pattern may be distinguished at even the lowest loading of 5% Re207. Although the 7-alumina pattern predominates at 5% Re207, the NH4Re04 pattern becomes predominant at 10% Re207 and at higher loadings. The Al-L series catalyst precursors showed only the 7-A1203 pattern, except in the case of 2.5-A1-L which showed four extra lines at the d-values 6.21, 4.81, 3.19 and 1.86 A, of which only the latter may be com- pared with a reflection from NH4Re04. The NH4Re04 structure for the series 155 Al-A materials was only identified for 20-A1-A and was then predominant. From observations of linewidth, the particle size of the NH4Re04 crystallites appeared to increase with increasing surface area of the support. Calcined catalysts from the series Al-A, -D and -L showed only the dif- fraction pattern of 7-alumina, while Al-V series catalysts showed extra reflec- tions at the d-values 5.36, 3.50 and 3.21 A which may be identified with the NH4Re04 structure. These data suggest that, before calcination, the impregnated materials from Al-V and Al-D, and from Al-A at high loadings, possessed gross struc- tures of NH4Re04 which may be related to the macroporous, interparticle rhenium aggregates identified in the surface analyses. Even after calcination the low surface area alumina Al-V apparently retained the Re04~ structure of deposited material to some extent, while the absence of reflections attrib- utable to rhenium species in Al-D, -L and -A catalysts tempts explanations which must be inconclusive. FABMS studies During fast-atom bombardment in the SIMS experiment, the energy of the primary beam is dissipated by a cascade process. Momentum is lost through a variety of collisional processes but the components of momentum are always directed towards the surface of the sample. In consequence, sections of the surface are pulled away to form the secondary beam of ion fragments. The components of this beam may well dissociate further before detection, but recombination of ion fragments does not occur. Thus second- ary ions may be single ions or clusters but, if a cluster is emitted, its constit- uent atoms must have come from adjacent surface sites. In the 'static-SIMS' experiments conducted here, the sputtering yield current was maintained at a low level, 1CT4 A s~1, so that a 'monolayer' of surface material was removed in approximately 60 min of bombardment. In contrast, the much greater secondary ion currents employed in 'dynamic- SIMS' remove a monolayer in a few seconds. By using static-SIMS for experiments lasting perhaps 5-10 min, the secondary ions detected have their origin in the outermost surface layer of the sample. Figure 5 illustrates examples of the fast-atom bombardment secondary- ion mass spectra obtained for pure crystalline Re207. Secondary ion frag- ments were identified from their m/e values and from the pattern of the two naturally occurring Re isotopes, '^Re and ^Re, with the isotopic ratio 1.70. The spectra are confined to the mass ranges corresponding to Re-containing species and the figures indicate the instrumental attenuation factors em- ployed. Low-resolution spectra are necessary to exhibit the necessarily low- intensity, high-mass fragments at low resolution the data acquisition does not resolve nearest-neighbour peaks and the output is a spectrum envelope. The positive-ion, low-resolution spectra yield no information additional to that shown by the corresponding high-resolution spectra and are not shown. As an aid to the interpretation of spectra, Table 6 lists the mje values for the fragments observed. 156 ReO;, (a) Mrgh Resolution FABMS ReO^ Re^ ReO; 3x10\" 200 210m, 220 230 230 240 250 260 /e / Fig. 5.

Catalyst spectra consistently possessed additional complexity due to the presence of surface carbonaceous impurities, and more importantly, to cluster ions possibly containing the nitrogen atom from the decomposition of NH4- Re04. To correlate peak intensities, the intensity data for rhenium fragments were normalised with respect to the ReO^ ion intensity. Table 7 lists the fragment intensity ratios, relative to ReO;\", for the negative, secondary ions containing Re atoms. The data show a quantitative correlation between the pure and supported compounds, for both catalyst precursors and for calcined catalysts. Although better correlation was achieved for 17.5% Re207 samples, it does appear that, even at 5% loading, the deposited Re04~ in the catalyst precursors and the RezC^ in the calcined catalysts was in a sufficiently aggregated or clumped state to produce mass spectra characteristic of the pure, unsupported structures. Some differences in these ratios are however significant. The 5% and 17.5% samples of NH4Re04/Al-V generated multiple-Re cluster ions whose relative intensities correlated with the data for pure Re207, with the ion Re20s~ being the predominant fragment of this type. The crystal structure of NH4ReC>4 consists of discrete Re04~ tetrahedra 159 TABLE 7 Ion fragment intensities for negative ions relative to Re0{~ Fragment NH4Re04 5%NH Al^O :4Re04/3s 17.5% Al^O NH4Re04/3\" Re^ 5% Re^/ Al^Oa1' 17.5% Rea07/ Al^Oa11 ReO- 0.096 0.04 0.089 0.063 0.07 ReO;- 1 1 1 1 1 1 ReC>3- 4.8 3.48 5.21 17.0 12.3 16.2 Red4- 1.06 1.5 2.64 24.5 8.48 9.9 Re^Oi- trace Re^Oa- trace trace trace Re204- 0.022 0.020 0.055 0.066 0.021 Re^Os- 0.082 0.08 0.23 0.16 0.046 Re,06- 0.036 0.03 0.058 0.03 0.016 RC207- 0.024 0.02 0.013 trace trace Re^Oa- 0.016 trace Re209~ trace trace trace ReiOio- 0.01 0.016 0.014 0.014 ReaOii- trace trace trace trace ResOz- trace Res03- trace trace Re304~ trace trace trace ReaOs- trace 0.011 0.011 trace ReaOo- trace 0.017 0.014 0.011 Re3C>7- 0.01 0.046 0.015 0.011 ReaOs\" trace 0.016 Re309~ 0.013 Re4Cr trace Re4C>2- trace trace RC403- trace before calcination. b After calcination. which, as observed, would not be expected to produce secondary-ion clusters containing more than one Re atom. In contrast, the molecular chain structure of crystalline RG^O-J should, and does, produce characteristic Re^Oy\" frag- ments with ReiOs\" (and, to a lesser extent, Re307~) predominating in intensity. Drying the NH4Re04-impregnated alumina at 110 C produced some decomposition to form Re207 which may lie at the immediate surface of the Re04~ aggregates. Consideration of the intensity ratio Re03~/Re04~ confirms this specula- tion. This ratio is 4.4:1 for crystalline NH4Re04 compared with 2.3:1 and 2.0:1 for the NH4ReC>4/Al-D samples at 5% and 17.5% Reat^ respectively. This decrease is consistent with the relative increase in Re04~ intensity ex- pected when Re^O-, is present due to the value 0.7:1 observed for this species. Conversely, the calcined catalysts exhibited the values 1.4:1 and 1.6:1 at 5% and 17.5% Re207 for this ratio, suggesting that either the ReaO^ aggregates retained some ReO^\" character or, as is to be expected, the structure of the Re^O^ aggregates on the alumina surface was more disperse than in the crys- talline state. The intensity ratios for the positive ions shown in Table 8 demonstrate this structural modification, the ratio of Re'^/ReO\"^ being always different for catalysts and precursors than for the pure compounds. 160 TABLE 8 Ion fragment intensities for positive ions relative to ReO; Sample Re+ Re0+ ReCV NH4ReC>4 (pure) 1.21 1.33 1 Re207 (pure) 2.20 2.63 1 5%NH4Re04/Al203a 4.8 2.63 1 17.5% NH4ReC>4/Al2C>3 a 2.33 1.65 1 5% Re207/Al203b 7.4 4.0 1 17.5%Re207/Al203b 5.2 2.73 1 \"Before calcination. hAfter calcination. The sputtering yield of the support metal ion, here A1'1\", has been shown [19] to increase monotonically as the surface coverage of a supported species decreases from the monolayer value. However the ReC^/AlO1 ion intensity ratios. Table 9, show a marked increase for NI-^Ret^-alumina samples with loading whereas for the Re^C^-alumina catalysts the ratio is independent of loading. Apparently the surface coverage of NH4ReC>4 adsorbed during impregnation varied with loading but, when calcination pro- ducing Re2C>7 had occured, the depth of aggregation increased so that the exposed surfaces of rhenium and aluminium oxides were the same at both loadings. In this context it is perhaps significant that secondary ion clusters containing both Re and Al atoms were not observed, although cluster ions from the support alone were common. There is therefore no evidence for aluminium mesoperrhenate(VII) structures [20] or for the formation of a monolayer of Re2C>7 [15].

These data imply that nitro- gen remained within the surface Re;!^ structure of calcined catalysts although its involvement or influence in catalytic activity is unknown. The decomposition of NH4Re04 on alumina produced, even at low loading, aggregates of Re^O-, perhaps lying on the surface of Re04~ clusters and residing on, or in, the surface structure of the alumina a model con- sistent with much of the preceding discussion and, in part, with the model proposed by Kerkhof et al. [7]. Catalyst activity The relationship between catalyst structure and activity has been debated by a number of workers. Kapteijn et al. [5], for example, observed a linear relationship between the activity and the Re^O-J loading for propylene metathesis and proposed a monomolecular layer of Re^0^ with 0.02% of the Re atoms being active. Using a novel catalyst activation procedure, Nakamura and Echigoya [21] found that the adsorption of oxygen onto prereduced Re207-alumina dramatically increased metathesis activity towards propene. Here the active site was identified as an Re\"\"\"\" ion, possibly Re44, which transferred an electron to a near-neighbour O;\" species bound to Al3\"1' and became active as Re1\"\"*\"1)+, approximately 20% of the total rhenium showing metathesis activity. 162 Andreev et al. [20] have suggested that olefin metathesis requires the participation of Re7\"\"\" in the form of a surface aluminium meso-perrhenate structure and of Re64, both of which interact with surface anionic vacancies to form F centres. For the catalysts prepared by vapour-phase condensation of Re2C>7, Olsthoom and Boelhouwer [15] suggested that the Re2C>7 layer on alumina consisted of small aggregates of Re^0^, bare alumina surface being exposed below 20% loading. They proposed a surface model in which the active catalyst saturated with Re2C>7 has the alumina surface completely covered by a monolayer of Re^O-,, in which less than 0.3% of the rhenium atoms were active. The variety and complexity of these models provided the impetus to observe metathesis activity in relationship to well-characterised catalyst surfaces. For experiments in which the only variable is the molecular structure of the esters (Table 11), the overall rate of metathesis of esters varied with the carbon-chain length to yield the overall rate order, methyl-4-pentenoate > methyl-10-undecenoate > methyl erucate. Verkuijien et al. [22] have shown that linear unsaturated esters metathesise, provided that the ester group and the carbon-carbon double bond are separated by at least one CH; group. In this work the esters R' CH^CH R^OOC^ differ in the numbers of CHs groups in R' and R2. We have suggested [10] that the large difference in activity observed between methyl-4-pentenoate and methyl-10-undecenoate is the result of the extra steric hindrance experienced in the propagation reaction of the carbene (b) of methyl-10-undecenoate due to the substantial increase in the number of CH^ groups in R2. /-Re 'i i CHR\" -Re II , CHR'COOCH, (a) (b) In contrast, the chain length of R' does not substantially hinder the reaction even though one might predict similar steric hindrance for R' in carbene (a), and hence the effects limiting metathesis propagation for carbene TABLE 11 Conversion data for metathesis reactions Ester Total conversion Molar ratio Conversion after after 20 min (%) ester/Re 5 min reaction (%)1' methyl-4-pentenoate 70 20:1 39.6 methyl-10-undecenoate 65 12:1 7.1 methyl erucate 50 6:1 5.4 'Reactions normally undertaken at 70 C. 0.5 g catalyst (20-A1-V), 7.9 mmol ester; solvent, 1 cm3 CHC13 containing 20 X 10-3 cm3 (0113)4 Sn.

In agreement with Verkuijien [23], we believe that ester molecules are strongly adsorbed onto the catalyst through the carbonyl group while being only weakly attached to the metathesis active site through the carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore the rate-determining behaviour of carbene (b) may arise because the carbonyl group in this alkyl- idene complex is strongly adsorbed and more or less immobilised on the surface. On approach of an ester molecule, the exchange of alkylidene groups necessary for productive reaction is severely hindered, thus reducing the metathesis activity. For methyl-4-pentenoate, the variation in the metathesis activity as a function of Re^O-^ loading is shown in Fig. 7 for the four alumina-supported series of catalysts; Fig. 8 shows the comparative percentage conversion achieved for the three esters with rhenium loading on Al-L. After an initial slow rise in percentage conversion, a near-exponential increase with increasing loading becomes curtailed to produce maximum activity at an Re207 con- centration which is characteristic for each alumina. This activity- Re^O-, loading pattern is essentially in agreement with that found by Kapteijn et al. [5], for propylene except that a maximum or approach to maximum activity was not observed. At least two explanations are possible for this behaviour of esters [10]. Fig. 7.

Reaction conditions are as specified for Fig. 7 except for a reaction tem- perature of 70 C for methyl erucate and methyl-10-undecenoate. The recovered catalyst after metathesis reaction with an ester was always found to have a layer of diester product strongly adsorbed onto its surface. Hence in ester metathesis, the rate of product desorption, k^, may become a limiting factor in competition with the rate of propagation, fep. If k^ remains constant and kg, > kp, then a plot of the reaction rate versus loading would remain linear, as observed for alkenes [5] where the products are only weakly adsorbed and presumably do not block the active sites. For ester metathesis, the number of active sites above 12% Re2C>7 has increased to provide the potential for greater activity but fep is now greater than k^. An increasing number of these sites become inaccessible through the presence of adsorbed ester and, relative to olefin metathesis, the catalyst activity is progressively diminished with increasing Ue^O-; loading, producing the observed maxima in the data. The data in Fig. 8 show that as the chain length of first R2 and then R1 was increased, the reduced activity at high loadings was translated into a broader maximum and then an extended plateau. These truncated maxima may indicate the difficulty experienced by the larger esters in diffusing to and from the active sites or may be the result of the reduced accessibility of the active sites due to the adsorption of product diesters. Although attractive, these models ignore the surface topology of the support or deposited Re^O-, and to be satisfactory they must include these considerations. When catalyst activity is related to surface characteristics, a number of correlations are successfully achieved. The most obvious of these shows that 165 the activity order A > L > D > V (that is, the order of percentage conversion for the catalysts on the aluminas Al-A .... Al-V) relates immediately to the order of the surface area of the support, A > L > D > V. However the dis- proportionally large difference in surface area between Al-A and Al-L was not reflected in the activity of the catalysts produced from them, and a better correlation is achieved for activity with the order of the surface area of the catalysts, A> L> D> V. As expected, metathesis activity requires the greatest possible surface area and hence the greatest achievable dispersion of the Re^O-J. The structural modification of this material brought about by its situation on the alumina surface would give rise to the maximum number of surface defects [20] and active sites. However the data reported here do not indicate that extreme dispersion of the Re207 occurred or that the situation was even approached, and there is in addition growing evidence [24] that total dispersion of supported mate- rial to produce isolated species is unlikely to occur, even at loadings of less than 1%. The alumina exerts a stabilising influence on the supported material [25] due to the primary adsorption forces and to the dispersing effect of the support. However, the primary adsorption sites are small in number and un- evenly distributed over the surface of the support so that the primary ad- sorption is confined to certain regions of the surface, ensuring that near- neighbour clusters develop. The adsorption force is long-range in character so that additional adsorption is more likely to occur on the same, strong adsorption sites and the clusters predominating on the surface accrue multi- layers and adopt a three-dimensional aspect. Direct evidence for these suppositions is given by the FABMS and X-ray data for the NH4Re04-alu- minas reported here where at only 5% loading the NH4ReC>4 existed in a 'crystalline', clumped condition on the surface. On calcination of these catalyst precursors decomposition occurred to form Re207, but this was accompanied by sublimation and redistribution of some of the Re207 on the alumina surface. The data reported here present strong evidence that the mesopores of the alumina support may constitute strong adsorption sites for the Re2C>7 vapour produced at 525 C. Moreover the pore-filling process began immediately at low % Re2C>7 (Fig. 9) and continued with loading. For example, at 10% Re2C>7 loading on Al-A the surface area increase was small but a significant reduction in pore volume had already occurred. In fact good correlation may be achieved between the amount of Re2C>7 retained after calcination (L > A > V ^ D), Table 4, the Re207 loading at which the activity maxima occurred (L > A > V > D), Figs. 7 and 8, the pore volume of the original alumina used to prepare the catalyst (L > A > V > D) and the reduction in pore volume observed for the catalysts (L > A > V > D), Table 5. The gross Re207 aggregates existing in the mesopores (FABMS data) may well be less accessible to the reactant molecules and also inherently less active, leading to the observed low activity at low loadings. This model also successfully explains the apparently anomalous 166 behaviour for the Al-D series catalysts. The non-porous alumina, Al-D, pro- duced the most acid catalyst at 5% loading and was the only low-loading catalyst to show significant activity, retaining its enhanced activity up to 11% Re-^O-J. The activity towards metathesis clearly depends upon facile accessibility of reactant to the surface of the deposited rhenium, as in this series of catalysts no deposition could occur within the pore structure and a dispersed Re207 structure was forced on the alumina surface even at low loadings. The activity fell prematurely after 11% RezO^ loading, presumably because further deposition occurred in the interparticle voids. Even though much of this weakly-bound material was sublimed on calcination, sufficient remained to 'glue' the catalyst particles together, reducing the availability of active material. We suggest that the adsorption, deposition and subsequent calcination procedures are necessary to induce a distribution of RG^O-J at high loadings onto the less energetic adsorption sites on the alumina surface which may limit the growth of multilayer Re207 clusters. These alumina-stabilised, thin clusters, possessing maximum active rhenium oxide surface area, dramatically increase metathesis activity through the presence of a large number of rhenium species.

Dearing School of Science, Humberside College of Higher Education, Cottingham Road, Hull, North HumbersideU.K. The catalytic activity of unsaturated esters over Re2O7/alumina decreases with molecular complexity, methyl-4-pentenoate > methyl-10-undecenoate > methyl erucate. The activity of each ester increases with Re2O7 loading, and in general shows a maximum at a particular Re2O7 content depending upon the surface characteristics of the alumina. A combination of techniques used to study the structure of the catalysts shows the prevalence of clusters of rhenium oxide on the surface and the influence of pore structure and surface area of the support on catalyst activity. Speculations are presented on the nature of the rhenium oxide aggregates. References 1 P.B. van Dam M.C. Mittelmeijer C. Boelhouwer J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1972 1221 2 J.C. Mol J. Mol.
