The production of fertilizers, explosives, and various other chemicals relies heavily on ammonia (NH3). Electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia, also known as the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is a potential alternative to the Haber-Bosch process that can be carried out at ambient conditions. However, many NRR catalysts suffer from low selectivity and require a large overpotential to drive the reaction, limiting their practical application. In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the mechanistic aspects of the NRR and the effect of curvature variation on the catalytic activity of silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs) decorated with 3d-5d transition metal single-atom catalysts. Our results suggest that the Os@SiCNT catalyst exhibits promising activity as an eNRR catalyst with an overpotential of 0.47 V and high selectivity over hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition. The electronic “acceptance-donation” interaction between N2 and Os promotes the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the catalyst surface. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that as the nanotube diameter decreases, the energy barrier for the NRR reaction decreases as well. However, this decrease in diameter also leads to a weaker capacity for *N2 adsorption, which may ultimately reduce the selectivity of the NRR reaction. These findings offer valuable insights that can aid in the rational design of nanotube-based electrocatalysts for eNRR.

It also serves as an alternative clean energy substitute for fossil fuels that can significantly reduce carbon emissions [2,3]. Nitrogen (N2), as the major nitrogen source for industrial NH3 synthesis, is extremely abundant in nature, making up around 78% of the atmosphere. However, the inert NN triple bond makes the conversion of N2 to NH3 very hard [4]. Currently, industrial ammonia synthesis mainly relies on the Haber-Bosch process under harsh conditions (15–25 MPa, 300–550 °C) [5–7], consuming nearly 2% of global electricity and emitting 1.44% of global emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 annually [8,9]. Inspired by biological nitrogen fixation [10], electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) was invented as a cleaner and more sustainable method to artificially produce NH3 at ambient temperature and pressure [11]. However, the current eNRR conversion is inefficient and is limited by a multi-step 6-electron transfer reaction with slow kinetics involved in the whole reaction process (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− = 2NH3) [12,13]. Besides, the catalytic efficiency is also affected by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [14,15]. Therefore, developing a novel electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity for NRR is in high demand. Noble metals such as Au, Ru, and Pt have been extensively studied as catalysts for the NRR and have demonstrated excellent catalytic performance. However, their high cost and limited resources have limited their practical applications [16,17]. In recent years, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for the NRR due to their high atom utilization, unique electronic properties, and multiple coordination sites [18–22]. SACs for the NRR include not only metals like Fe [23] and Mo [24], but also non-metals like B [25] and N [26]. These SACs share a common feature: the coexistence of occupied and unoccupied d (p) orbitals. The unoccupied d (p) orbitals can accept long-pair electrons from the N2 molecule, while the occupied d (p) orbitals can donate electrons into the antibonding orbitals of the N2 molecule to activate it and strengthen the SACN bonds. In addition to the special requirements for SACs, it is also important for SACs to be supported on a suitable substrate in order to stabilize the SACs and prevent aggregation and diffusion. The substrate can also serve as an electron reservoir, donating or accepting electrons during the NRR process [2,27,28]. Different substrates and coordination environments can modulate the chemical characteristics of the SACs, control their binding with the reactants, and regulate the reaction paths and limiting potentials of the NRR [18]. A number of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been explored as substrates for NRR-immobilized SACs due to their large specific surface area and diverse active site distribution, including graphene [15,29], g-C3N4 [30–32], Boron sheet [33,34], g-CN [35], and hexagonal BN [36,37]. Despite their potential as substrates for the NRR, there have been relatively few studies on the use of nanotubes for this purpose. However, the high specific surface area and hollow structure of nanotubes can provide more active sites for gas adsorption [38], which may enhance their performance in the NRR. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of nanotubes as substrates for the NRR. For example, Zhang et al. coated Rh nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the NRR and demonstrated excellent performance, which may be due to the synergy between the high-spin polarization of Rh and the charge exchange between Rh and the CNTs [39]. Zhou et al. found that filling boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with B atoms enabled them to have superior orbital energy and occupancy for N2 activation and hydrogenation [40]. Our previous work demonstrated that Os atoms on BNNTs can act as a channel for interfacial charge transfer between N2 molecule and the substrate, and that the NRR process is accelerated by the combined action of the Os atoms and the curved surface of the nanotubes [41]. These findings highlight the potential of nanotubes as substrates for the NRR and suggest that they may be promising materials for further study in this area. Silicon carbide nanotube (SiCNT) was first synthesized in the laboratory in 2001 [42]. It has garnered attention for their potential use as catalysts for the CO oxidation [43], CH3NH2 dehydrogenation [44] and gas-sensor [45] due to their unique chemical and physical properties. SiCNTs have a higher stability when the ratio of silicon to carbon is 1:1 [46], and their polarity and sp 3 hybridization make them more reactive than carbon nanotubes and boron nitride nanotubes [47,48]. Previous research has also shown that defective SiCNTs have a higher binding energy for hydrogen storage and adsorption than the original intact nanotubes [49], and that their capacity for NO2 adsorption can be enhanced by doping with phosphorus [50]. Although pristine SiC nanotubes are semiconducting, decorating them with single metal atoms imparts metallic properties that could prove advantageous for electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we utilized Si/C-vacancy defective SiCNTs as a substrate to anchor single transition metal (TM) atoms (3d, 4d, and 5d) and explored their electrocatalytic NRR mechanism. We employed a two-step screening strategy proposed by Ling et al. [51] to filter the catalysts and identified a single Os atom embedded in a defective (8, 0) SiCNT (denoted as Os@SiCNT) with a low overpotential of 0.47 V through a distal mechanism. We also investigated the effect of the curvature of the SiCNTs on the NRR performance and found that the catalytic activity decreased with decreasing curvature. The origin of the high activity of the Os@SiCNT was analyzed based on the charge transfer mechanism, and density of states. Our work not only discovered a new type of SiCNT-based NRR catalyst with high performance, but also provided a reference for future studies on nanotube-type catalysts for nitrogen fixation 2 Computational methods The first-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [52]. Electron-ion interactions were described using the projected enhanced wave (PAW) method [53], and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with a Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to handle the exchange-related potentials [54,55]. The Brillouin zones were sampled using a 1 × 1 × 9 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for (8, 0) single-walled SiCNT anchored with SACs. The simulated (8, 0) zigzag chirality SiCNT consisted of 48 Si and 48 C atoms, and a monovacancy was created by removing one Si/C atom to anchor the SACs. The size of the supercell was chosen to be large enough to prevent interactions between the *NxHy species anchored on periodic supercells. To study the effect of different SiCNT configurations on the eNRR, three different structures were examined: a (6, 0) zigzag SiCNT, a (12, 0) zigzag SiCNT, and a 2D h-SiC nanosheet. All structures were fully relaxed until the energy and force components were less than 10−4 eV and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion was set to 450 eV. The vacuum region of SiC nanosheets was kept at 15 Å to avoid artificial interaction. Spin polarization was also taken into account in the calculations. We considered at least four adsorption configurations for each *NxHy species, with different distances or rotation angles, in order to obtain the most stable structure. The structures shown in this work were visualized by Materials Studio [56] and VESTA [57]. To examine the stability of a single transition metal (TM) substitution in a SiCNT substrate, we calculated the binding energy (Eb) using the following equation: (1) E b = E ( TM @ SiCNT ) − ( E vacancy + E ( TM ) ) . Where E(TM@SiCNT) is the total energy of the individual TM atom anchored on the SiCNT substrate, Evacancy is the energy of SiCNT with C/Si vacancy defects, and E(TM) is the energy of the TM atom. The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process (N2 + 6 H + + 6 e– = 2 NH3) consists of six net coupled proton and electron transfer (CPET) steps. To calculate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for each fundamental step, we used the method developed by Skulason et al. which involves replacing the free energy of (H + + e− ) with half the chemical formula of the hydrogen molecule [58]. The equation for calculating ΔG is as follows: (2) Δ G = Δ E + Δ ZPE − T Δ S + eU + Δ G pH . Where ΔE is the change in self-consistent energy (reaction energy), ΔZPE is the difference in zero-point energy, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the change in entropy. The free energy difference is influenced by a potential bias U and an infinite pH, resulting in a shift of ΔG (U, pH) = ΔGU +ΔGpH = −eU − kT ln 10 × pH. In our work, we assumed that the pH is zero. To obtain the TΔS and ZPE values for the gas phase, we used the NIST-JANAF thermochemical tables [59]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Stabilities and structures of TM@SiCNT The SiCNTs with single Si or C vacancies were first fabricated and optimized. The formation energies of these single vacancy defects were computed by the equation, Ef = E ( SiCNT) - Evacancy - ESi/C, where E(Si/C) is the energy per atom of Si or C elemental crystals. The defect formation energy of the Si vacancy was determined as -8.26 eV, while that of the C vacancy was -3.65 eV. From this, it can be observed that Si vacancy on the SiCNT is more likely to form. Here, we considered both Si and C vacancies as potential anchor sites for SACs. A total of 18 types of 3d∼5d transition metal (TM) SACs including VB, VIB, VIIB, and VIII TMs were respectively adopted to substitute one Si/C atom on the surface of a (8, 0) SiCNT, as shown in Fig. 1 a. Here, the early and late TMs including IB, IIB, IIIB, and IVB group elements are not considered because they either lack spare electrons to weaken the NN bond or have no empty d orbital to accept the lone-pair electrons from the N2 molecule. The corresponding binding energies (Eb) of these TM SACs occupying silicon (Si) and carbon (C) vacancies in SiCNTs were calculated and illustrated in Fig. 1b. The negative Eb values indicate TM SACs are stably anchored at the vacancy sites and unlikely to aggregate. Fig. S1 shows that the SiCNT structure remains largely unchanged after optimization, while the larger radius of the TM atoms causes a slight outward shift. The lower Eb of TM SACs at Si vacancies compared to C vacancies suggests a preference for occupying Si sites. This preference likely arises from the closer electronegativity match between TMs and Si versus C. Based on the calculated Eb, subsequent analyses focus solely on TM SACs incorporated at Si vacancy sites. Additionally, to ensure robust fixation of individual metal atoms on the SiCNTs, we selected only systems with relatively lower binding energies, specifically those containing V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ta, W, and Os, for subsequent analysis. 3.2 Adsorption of N2 and initial screening The adsorption and activation of N2 molecule on the surface of a catalyst is a crucial step in the NRR process. We first investigated the adsorption behavior of N2 molecule on SAC anchored on Si-defective SiCNT (denoted as TM@SiCNT) in two adsorption configurations: end-on and side-on, as illustrated in Fig. 2 a. The obtained adsorption energy values (ΔE*N2), as shown in Fig. 2c, indicate that N2 molecules are more likely to be adsorbed in the end-on configuration, in agreement with previous studies [60,61] on SACs for NRR. Therefore, only the end-on adsorption configurations are considered in the subsequent work. Upon adsorption of N2 molecules on the catalyst surface, the length of the NN bond was found to be slightly elongated compared to the original free N2 molecule, with a bond length of 1.12 Å, as illustrated in Fig. 2b (black line). It suggests N2 molecule has been activated after adsorption. The extent of NN bond elongation varied among different SACs, with Ta, W, and Os SACs showing a bond length of ∼1.15 Å and the Mn SAC showing little change. We further calculated the Bader charge of TM and *N2 in these systems after N2 adsorption, as listed in Table. S1 and shown in Fig 2b (red line). The results indicate that the N2 molecule as a whole gains electrons from the metal SACs, forming a charge state of -0.19–-0.41. A positive correlation was observed between the NN bond length and the number of electrons gained by the N2 molecule. Additionally, it is found that the terminal N atom (N2 in Table S1) loses electrons while the proximal N atom (N1 in Table S1) gains electrons after adsorption. The change in electron distribution on the two nitrogen atoms after adsorption can make it easier for hydrogen atoms to bind to the terminal nitrogen atom and promote further hydrogenation. Previous studies [37,51,62] have identified that the first and sixth hydrogenation steps are most likely to be the potential-determining step (PDS) in the NRR process. For the first hydrogenation step, it requires a significant amount of energy to break the inert NN triple bond (*N2 + H+ + e− → *N2H). The last hydrogenation step involves a transition from a stable half-filled sp 3 hybrid orbital of *NH2 to an unstable fully filled orbital of *NH3, which is also an endothermic process. In order to identify suitable catalysts for the NRR process, we calculated the energy barriers (ΔG) for these two steps for a range of candidate catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2d. Compared to the onset potential of the best bulk TM catalyst (1.08 V for Ru [0001] surface) [63], only the catalysts with ΔG(*N2→*N2H) and ΔG(*NH2→*NH3) below 0.75 eV are kept here. Results show that Mo (0.72 eV), Ta (0.61 eV), W (0.39 eV), and Os (0.63 eV) SACs possess small energy barrier (ΔG(*N2→*N2H) < 0.75 eV) for the first protonation step. These catalysts also had longer NN bond lengths in the *N2 state, indicating sufficient activation of the N2 molecule. For the last protonation step, six systems had small energy barriers (ΔG(*NH2→*NH3) < 0.75 eV), including V, Cr, Mn, Mo, Tc, and Os. Based on these results, we selected Mo and Os as the two candidates for further study due to their low energy barriers for both the first and last protonation steps. 3.3 NRR mechanisms on Mo@SiCNT and Os@SiCNT There are two generally accepted mechanisms for the end-on adsorption model of the NRR process: the distal pathway and the alternating pathway, as depicted in Fig. 3 a. In the distal pathway, the terminal N atom is hydrogenated continually until the release of the first NH3 molecule, after which the adsorbed *N is further protonated to form the second NH3 molecule. In the alternating pathway, proton/electron pairs attack the two N atoms alternately until the formation of *NH2 NH2, followed by cleavage of the NN bond and the successive release of two NH3 molecules. We performed complete NRR process calculations on Mo and Os SACs and plotted the ΔG of each step and the corresponding intermediate structures in Fig. 3b-c. For both SACs, the electrochemical NRR process is more inclined towards the distal pathway. In the second protonation step, *NNH tends to be protonated to form *NNH2 rather than *NHNH due to the lower ΔG value of the former. Additionally, we observed that the Mo SAC has a significantly stronger adsorption capacity for N2 molecule compared to the Os SAC. According to the Sabatier principle, an ideal heterogeneous catalyst needs to achieve a delicate balance between activating and desorbing reactants [64]. In this case, the strong binding of N2 to the Mo SAC results in a high energy barrier for the desorption of NH3 (1.33 eV). On the other hand, the Os SAC has a moderate adsorption ability for N2, leading to both a lower energy barrier for activating reactants and a lower desorption barrier for NH3 (0.34 eV). The potential-determining step (PDS) for both SACs (Os@SiCNT and Mo@SiCNT) occurs during the first protonation step (*N2→*N2H), with energy barriers of 0.63 and 0.72 eV at zero electrode potential, respectively. Both values are lower than the limiting potential of the Ru [0001] surface (1.08 eV), which has been reported to be the most effective bulk metal catalyst for NRR [58]. To evaluate the catalytic reactivity of these materials, we calculated the overpotential (η) using the equation η = Ue − Ul, where Ue is the equilibrium potential of the NRR (approximately -0.16 V) [2] and Ul is the limiting potential, calculated as Ul = −ΔGpds/e, with ΔGpds being the free energy of the PDS. The resulting overpotential for Os@SiCNT in the NRR is 0.47 V, which is comparable to some other reported high-performing two-dimensional NRR catalysts such as Mn-Nb2CN2 (0.51 V) [65], V-MoP (0.49 V) [66], the well-established Re (111) surface (0.50 V) [67]. However, compared to some exceptional 2D NRR catalysts like PdNb@BP (0.20 V) [68], Fe2/g-CN (-0.03 V) [69], V2-Pc (0.23 V) [70], VTa-Pc (0.31 V) [70], the overpotential of Os@SiCNT is slightly higher. Loading dual metal atoms onto the nanotube catalyst could potentially further reduce this overpotential in future work. We further used ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation to examine the thermal stability of Os@SiCNT at 300 K for 6 ps with a time step of 2 fs. As shown in Fig. S2, during the simulation calculations, both energy and temperature remain in an oscillatory stable state with minimal fluctuations. Moreover, following thermal stability testing, no significant structural alterations were observed in the nanotube, confirming the thermal stability of the modified catalyst. During the process of NRR, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) will consume protons and electrons, leading to a decrease in the conversion rate of N2 to NH3. To effectively suppress the selectivity of HER, an ideal high-performance NRR catalyst should have a lower energy barrier for the NRR process than the Heyrovsky step (H* + H+ + e− → H2). In our study, the energy barriers for the Heyrovsky step were found to be 1.53 eV for Mo@SiCNT and 0.98 eV for Os@SiCNT (Fig. S3), respectively. These values are larger than the limiting potentials for NRR, indicating that both Mo@SiCNT and Os@SiCNT can effectively suppress the selectivity of HER and potentially improve the overall efficiency of the NRR process. To determine if the active sites were covered by H2O molecules, H2O adsorption on the surface of Os@SiCNT was investigated. A series of models were constructed with H2O molecules adsorbed on the Os single atom at various angles, and the most stable adsorption configuration was determined, as presented in Fig. S4. The adsorption energy for a water molecule in the stable state was calculated to be -0.18 eV, while the adsorption energy for a nitrogen molecule in end-on adsorption was -0.66 eV. These results indicate that the metal active site would be preferentially covered by N2 rather than H2O. This further underscores the excellent selectivity of Os@SiCNT as a catalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction. 3.4 The effect of the curvature Numerous researchers have noted that the curvature variation of nanotubes has an effect on the catalytic activity of nanotubes [71–73]. Chen et al. found that the energy barrier for the oxidation of SO2 decreases with the increase of curvature of single-walled carbon nanotubes [74]. Xu et al. reported that decreasing the diameter of carbon nanotubes can enhance the capability of H to bind nanotubes [75]. Herein, to investigate the effect of curvature on the performance of the NRR, we compared the NRR activity of Os-supported SAC anchored on (6, 0), (8, 0), and (12, 0) zigzag SiCNTs and a two-dimensional hexagonal SiC nanosheet (2D h-SiC), as shown in Fig. 4 a. Our results (Fig. 4b) showed that the potential-determining step for all four systems is the same, i.e., the first protonation step: *N2 → *N2H. The energy barrier for this step was found to decrease as the curvature of the SiCNTs increased, with the lowest energy barrier of 0.60 eV being observed for the (6, 0) SiCNT, as shown in Fig. 4b. To further confirm this trend, we also calculated the NRR activity of Mo- and Ta-based SACs anchored on SiCNTs with different diameters and observed a similar trend for the first protonation step in these systems (Table S2). These results suggest that decreasing the diameter of the SiCNTs might be an effective approach to enhance the activity of SACs for the NRR. To understand the observed trend, we used the Os-supported SiC nanotubes and nanosheet as an example. The first protonation step: *N2 → *N2H, is the PDS for all the four structures. Therefore, the activity of SiCNTs with different diameters in the NRR is closely related to the strength of nitrogen (N2) adsorption on the catalyst surface. Specifically, as the diameter of the nanotubes decreases from 8.1 Å to 6.1 Å, ΔG(*N2) significantly increases from -0.15 eV to -0.01 eV, indicating a decrease in N2 adsorption ability. This is also supported by the Bader charge analysis of the adsorbed N2 molecules (Table S3), which shows that in the (8,0) and (12,0) SiCNTs and h-SiC, approximately 0.30e− was transferred from Os SAC to the adsorbed N2 molecule, whereas only 0.26e− could be transferred in the (6,0) SiCNTs. Moreover, the (8,0) and (12,0) SiCNTs as well as h-SiC exhibit a longer NN bond length (∼1.145 Å) in comparison to the (6,0) SiCNTs (∼1.142 Å). This suggests that N2 molecules are more activated in systems with larger radii. Although the (6,0) SiCNT has the lowest hydrogenation energy barrier for *N2 (0.60 eV), its weaker *N2 adsorption capacity may reduce the selectivity of the NRR reaction. Therefore, smaller diameter is not necessarily more advantageous. Lastly, we further inspect the electronic structures of Os-supported (8,0) SiCNT. The projected density of states (PDOS) of the pristine SiCNT, Os@SiCNT and N2 adsorbed Os@SiCNT are presented in Fig. 5a∼c, respectively. It is evident from our results that the incorporation of Os single atom significantly enhances the conductivity of the pristine SiCNT by extending the valence bands above the Fermi level. After the adsorption of N2 molecules, the Os-5d orbitals and 2p orbitals of N2 display evident hybridization, as depicted in Fig. 5 c, demonstrating a strong bond between the two species. The charge density difference analysis (Fig. S5) of N2 adsorbed on Os@SiCNT also reveals a significant charge exchange between the N2 molecule and the Os atom. The anti-bonding orbital π2p* of the N2 molecule undergoes substantial changes following adsorption. Specifically, the Os atom's spare 5d electrons interact with the N2 molecule's π2p* orbital, leading to the formation of partially occupied π 2p* orbital at the top of the valence bands (Fig. 5e). This d -π 2p* orbital hybridization is considered essential in strengthening the metal-N2 interaction and weakening the NN triple bond [76]. 4 Conclusion In this study, we conducted a comprehensive screening of catalysts for NRR using spin-polarized DFT computations on a series of transition metal SACs supported on defective silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs). Our results indicate that Os@SiCNT shows promising catalytic activity for NRR through a distal pathway with an overpotential of 0.47 V, while suppressing competitive HER. The enhanced electric conductivity due to Os-doping and the “donation-backdonation” process for N2 activation on Os SAC is attributed to the novel NRR activity of Os@SiCNT. Additionally, we investigated the influence of SiCNTs with different diameters on NRR activity and found that a moderate reduction in diameter can decrease the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of NRR. However, excessively small diameters can weaken N2 adsorption and decrease the selectivity for NRR. Overall, our work not only discovered a highly effective SiCNT-based NRR catalyst, but also provided valuable insights for future studies on nanotube-type catalysts for nitrogen fixation.

        "dc:description": "The production of fertilizers, explosives, and various other chemicals relies heavily on ammonia (NH3). Electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to ammonia, also known as the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), is a potential alternative to the Haber-Bosch process that can be carried out at ambient conditions. However, many NRR catalysts suffer from low selectivity and require a large overpotential to drive the reaction, limiting their practical application. In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the mechanistic aspects of the NRR and the effect of curvature variation on the catalytic activity of silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs) decorated with 3d-5d transition metal single-atom catalysts. Our results suggest that the Os@SiCNT catalyst exhibits promising activity as an eNRR catalyst with an overpotential of 0.47 V and high selectivity over hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) competition. The electronic “acceptance-donation” interaction between N2 and Os promotes the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the catalyst surface. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that as the nanotube diameter decreases, the energy barrier for the NRR reaction decreases as well. However, this decrease in diameter also leads to a weaker capacity for *N2 adsorption, which may ultimately reduce the selectivity of the NRR reaction. These findings offer valuable insights that can aid in the rational design of nanotube-based electrocatalysts for eNRR.",
