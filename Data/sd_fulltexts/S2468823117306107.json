Graphical abstract Basic lithium phosphate (B-LPO) catalyst selectively produces unsaturated alcohols from epoxides. The catalytic activity of B-LPO is known to originate from appropriate acidic-basic properties, but no details were available on the structure of the active site. In this study, experimental methods and DFT calculations were performed in an attempt to identify the active surface structure of B-LPO for the isomerization of 2,3-epoxybutane to 3-buten-2-ol. The experimental results showed that exchanged Na ions in B-LPO suppressed the formation of an acid-catalyzed by-product (methyl ethyl ketone). In addition, H2O had a negative effect on the formation of 3-buten-2-ol due to the preoccupation of the active site. DFT calculations in conjunction with these experimental observations showed that the most plausible active surface for the formation of 3-buten-2-ol is the (001) surface of LPO whose acidic proton is exchanged with Na atom. On this surface, the under-coordinated Li atoms and the surface PO groups are exposed, and these play a role in activating the CO bond of an epoxide ring, and in receiving a proton from the terminal carbon, respectively.

Catalytic dehydration of 2,3-butanediol is an effective way in that various chemicals such as methyl ethyl ketone [3], 3-buten-2-ol (BO) [4,5], 2,3-epoxybutane (EB) [6], and 1,3-butadiene [7,8] can be produced. Among these products, 1,3-butadiene is practically important chemical in the synthesis of polymers, including ABS, NBR, and SBR polymers. In this regard, production of 1,3-butadiene from 2,3-butanediol has been extensively studied [7,8]. Sato et al. reported the direct production of 1,3-butadiene from 2,3-butanediol using rare-earth metal oxides [7]. Sc2O3 was the best catalyst that showed 88% yield of 1,3-butadiene. They also found that BO was an intermediate chemical during the formation of 1,3-butadiene. The same group also reported that ZrO2 based catalyst were effective to the production of BO from 2,3-butanediol [4,5]. Filimonov et al. also reported the direct formation of 1,3-butadiene using silica-supported sodium phosphates [8]. They observed that contact time and Na/P ratio considerably influenced product distribution. As similar to the report by Sato et al., BO was detected as an intermediate for the formation of 1,3-butadiene. Dehydrative epoxidation of 2,3-butanediol using Cs/SiO2 catalyst can be another alternative way for the production of 1,3-butadiene [6]. This reaction produces EB from 2,3-butanediol, and the product can be isomerized into BO. There are several reported catalysts for the selective isomerization of epoxides into unsaturated alcohols, such as Au/TiO2 (liquid-phase isomerization) [9,10] and lithium phosphates (gas-phase isomerization) [11–13]. In the isomerization of epoxides, it was commonly reported that the acidic-basic properties of a catalyst determine catalytic performance [9–14]. Teranishi et al. studied the effects of acidic-basic properties on the isomerization of propylene oxide [11,14]. When they utilized acidic zeolites, only carbonyl compounds including acetone and propionaldehyde were produced [14]. They also found that the ratio of acetone to propionaldehyde was proportional to the acidic strength of a catalyst. In contrast, lithium phosphate (Li3PO4, hereafter LPO)-based catalysts were capable of producing allyl alcohol [11]. Stoichiometric LPO exhibited rather poor selectivity toward allyl alcohol (17%), but, when LPO was synthesized with the addition of other alkali-metals (Na or K), it showed higher selectivity (∼86%) as well as higher activity. In particular, Li2NaPO4, so-called basic lithium phosphate (B-LPO), showed the best performance. The LPO catalysts that contained alkali metals possessed stronger basic sites and weaker acidic sites than the stoichiometric LPO, which indicated that basic sites are essential for the formation of allyl alcohol. The authors also performed reaction tests by titrating acidic or basic sites with pyridine or dichloroacetic acid, respectively, and thereby found that both acidity and basicity were required for the formation of allyl alcohol. Zhong et al. reported a similar tendency whereby basic LPO showed a catalytic performance that was higher than that of stoichiometric LPO [12]. They also studied the effect of precursors for lithium, sodium, and phosphate on the morphology and catalytic properties of basic LPO [13]. Lithium hydroxide and sodium phosphate were more appropriate precursors, as the synthesized LPO showed higher performance thanks to a crystallinity and a surface area that was better and higher, respectively, than that of the others tested. Previous studies helped explain the isomerization of epoxides in terms of acid-base catalysis. However, no studies regarding surface structures and the roles of the surface moieties have been performed, which limits a fundamental understanding of the catalysis in the reaction. The identification of active surface structures would be helpful to design improved catalyst for this reaction. Herein, we rationally identified the active surface of an LPO catalyst for the isomerization of EB to BO, and proposed the roles of the surface moieties during catalysis. Basic and neutral lithium phosphates (B-LPO and N-LPO, respectively) were compared to identify characteristics of the active catalytic materials. We performed several experiments including catalytic activity tests, structural characterization, and acidic-basic characterization. Based on the experimental evidences, theoretical DFT calculations were carried out to identify the active surface of LPO. The presence of the identified active surface was also confirmed via FT-IR analyses. Finally, the roles of the surface moieties on the active surface structure were proposed, based on the optimized geometry for adsorption of EB. These results will be helpful in the design and synthesis of more active catalysts for these types of reactions. 2 Experimental and theoretical methods 2.1 Preparation of catalysts Basic lithium phosphate (B-LPO) was prepared via precipitation. First, 1.82g of sodium phosphate monobasic (0.015mol, NaH2PO4, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.28g of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (0.030mol, LiOH·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 15ml and 10ml of deionized water, respectively. The former solution (NaH2PO4) was transferred to a 100ml round-bottom flask, and was then heated to 40°C with stirring. The aqueous solution of LiOH·H2O was then added drop-wise with vigorous stirring. A white precipitate was immediately formed when the solution was added. After complete injection of the solution, the mixed solution was aged for 24h at 40°C. The white precipitates were isolated on a filter, washed three times with 200ml of de-ionized water, and dried overnight at 343K. Calcination of the dried precipitates was conducted at 673K (5K/min of ramping speed) for 6h. The resultant powder was ground and sieved to retain aggregates below 200μm prior to a use in a catalytic reaction. The preparation of neutral lithium phosphate (N-LPO) followed a procedure similar to that of B-LPO, except for the source of phosphate. First, 1.28g of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (0.030mol, LiOH·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 10ml of deionized water, and then the solution was heated to 60°C with stirring. The solution was neutralized via the drop-wise injection of 0.7M H3PO4 aqueous solution with vigorous stirring. The neutralized solution was aged for 24h at 60°C. The remaining procedures were identical to those for B-LPO preparation: filtration, washing, drying, calcination, and grinding. 2.2 Catalytic activity tests Catalytic reactions for the isomerization of trans-2,3-epoxybutane (hereafter EB, purchased from Alfa Aesar (97%)) were performed on a fixed-bed quartz reactor with a thermocouple well. A K-type thermocouple was placed on the thermocouple well to measure the reaction temperature, and the reactor was externally heated using an electric furnace. A varied amount of catalyst (3–50mg) was used in the catalytic reaction to maintain a conversion level lower than 20%. The reactor was heated to the desired temperatures with a ramping rate of 10°C/min and was maintained for 30min with a flow of dry N2 (99.999%, 30cm3min−1). An aqueous solution of the reactant was then injected using a liquid syringe pump (Cole-Palmer 74900 series) into a pre-heating zone, which was maintained at 200°C. The values for the concentration of the reactant solution and dry N2 flow rate were varied to control the partial pressure of H2O (0–62kPa) while maintaining other conditions in a constant state: total flow rate (51sccm) and the partial pressure of EB (0.9kPa). In the reaction condition, there were no mass transfer limitations (Mears criterion for external mass transfer limitation, and Weisz-Prater criterion for internal mass transfer limitation; see Supporting information). Product gases were cooled using a helix-type condenser, and liquefied contents were collected hourly in a sample tube containing deionized water. Acetonitrile was used as an external standard for quantification. The products were analyzed using gas chromatography (Younglin ACME 6100 instrument) equipped with a FID detector and an Rtx®-VRX capillary column (Restek, cat. # 19316). The data acquired after 2h of reaction time were used to compare the activity of the catalysts. 2.3 Characterization High-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HR-TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-3010 microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D-MAX2500-PC powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406Å) in an operating mode of 50kV and 100mA. The crystallite sizes were calculated based on peaks at 16.8° ((010) plane) and 36.9° ((002) plane) using the Scherrer equation. N2 adsorption-desorption analyses were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 instrument. The specific BET surface area was calculated at P/Po =0.1–0.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a KRATOS AXIS electron spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation. The binding energies were corrected using C 1s as an internal standard (284.5eV). The peaks were fitted by mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian functions (10% Lorentzian) with subtraction of the Shirley-type background using a XPS peak-fitting program (XPSPEAK 4.1). The 7Li and 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the samples were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 WB (400MHz) spectrometer operated at frequencies of 156 and 162MHz, respectively. A magic angle spin speed of 7kHz was used for the spectral recording. 2.4 Computational details Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [15]. We used a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) parameterized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional [16]. Ionic cores were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [17]. Dispersion forces were included with the DFT-D2 Grimme's empirical correction [18]. The wave functions were represented by the expansion of plane waves with an energy cutoff of 400eV. A 1×1×1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was used to sample the Brillioun zone. For bulk optimization, the energy cutoff and k-point mesh were increased to 520eV and 6×6×6, respectively. All calculations were converged until the forces on all atoms were less than 0.03eV/Å. The electronic optimization steps were converged self-consistently to fewer than 2×10−5 eV. An experimentally identified LPO structure with the Pmn21 space group [19] was used as an initial structure for the bulk optimization. The geometry and structural parameters for the optimized bulk are provided in the Supporting information (Fig. S1 and Table S1) The optimized lattice constants were 6.16Å (a), 5.28Å (b), 4.90Å (c), which was in good agreement with the experimental values of 6.11Å (a), 5.23Å (b), 4.85Å (c). The optimized parameters were used to construct asymmetric slab models for (001), (010), and (100) planes of LPO. The surface unit cells were obtained by cleaving all possible terminations perpendicular to these planes, and the p(2×2) supercells of the surface unit cells were used. All slab models consisted of at least 4 atomic layers. The bottom two layers were fixed while the remaining top layers were allowed to relax. In order to compare the relative stability in terms of surface free energy, identical bottom layers were used for terminations perpendicular to the same plane. The slab thicknesses and number of atoms for the slab models are provided in Table S2. Vacuum gaps thicker than 15Å were included, to prevent non-physical electronic interactions. More detailed description for the calculation of surface free energies is provided in Supporting information. The charge density difference for EB adsorption was obtained by subtracting the charge densities of isolated EB and the bare surface from that of the adsorbed geometry (VESTA ver. 3.3.1). A charge density of 0.0025electrons/Å3 was used to represent the isosurface. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physicochemical properties The crystallographic and textural properties were characterized by TEM, XRD (Fig. 1 ), NMR (Fig. S2), and N2 adsorption-desorption analyses. The specific BET surface areas for B-LPO and N-LPO were 23.5 and 3.4m2/g, respectively. These surface areas are similar to the values in the previous study by Teranishi et al. [11]. In TEM images of both catalysts (Fig. 1A and B), agglomerates of rod-shaped crystallites were observed. The crystallites were somewhat inhomogeneous, whose sizes ranges from tens of nanometers to several hundred nanometers. An HR-TEM image of B-LPO clearly shows the lattice of the (010) plane of Li3PO4 crystallite (space group Pmn21 [19]), and the (001) plane can also be recognized in its FFT pattern (Fig. 1C and inset image). The (001) and (010) planes constitute the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively, of the LPO crystallite. The XRD patterns for the two catalysts matched well with patterns of the Li3PO4 with the Pmn21 space group (PDF#25-1030, Fig. 1D). Neither peak shifts nor additional peaks were observed for both catalysts. Crystallite sizes for B-LPO was smaller than that for N-LPO, as evidenced by broader peaks. The calculated crystallite sizes based on (010) peak (16.8°) are 25 and 37nm, respectively for B-LPO and N-LPO. When the size is calculated using the (002) peak (36.9°), it gives larger values for crystallite size (35nm for B-LPO and 40nm for N-LPO) than those from (010) peak. It also implies rod-like shape of LPO crystallites. The spectra of 7Li and 31P NMR for the two catalysts were almost identical (Fig. S2). This indicates that the local environment near Li and P atoms were quite similar for the two catalysts. The peak in NMR spectra of B-LPO was slightly broader than that of N-LPO, which could be caused from lower crystallinity of B-LPO. The atomic composition and chemical states of the elements were analyzed via XPS (Table 1 , Fig. 2 ). For both catalysts, the atomic ratio of Li to P approximated a stoichiometric value of 3 (2.9 for B-LPO and 2.8 for N-LPO). The measured oxygen content was somewhat lower than a stoichiometric value of 4 (3.1 for both catalysts) due to the lower inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons from the O 1s orbitals [20,21]. A small quantity of sodium (Na/P=0.1) was also detected for B-LPO. The binding energies (BEs) for Li 1s were 54.3 and 54.4eV for B-LPO and N-LPO, respectively. The BEs for P 2p3/2 were 133.4 and 133.5eV for B-LPO and N-LPO, respectively. These values are within the previously reported values of lithium contained oxides and phosphates [22]. For B-LPO, the BE of Na 1s was 1072.1eV, which is higher than the reported value for Na3PO4 (1070.9–1071.3eV) [22–24]. This value more closely approximates that for Na exchanged zeolites [25]. 3.2 Reaction tests Reaction of EB over LPO catalysts produced two isomerization products, i.e. BO and MEK. BO is the product when CC bond is formed after CO bond cleavage, whereas MEK is produced via CO cleavage followed by CO formation (Scheme 1 ). Catalytic performance of two catalysts for isomerization of EB is compared in Fig. 3 . Reaction without a catalyst showed quite low activity (conversion 3%, BO selectivity 21%, and MEK selectivity 68%). Compared to N-LPO, B-LPO showed a 6-fold higher specific activity (49.3 vs. 8.3mmolEB/gcat h), and even higher BO formation rate (46.2 vs. 4.4mmolBO/gcat h) due to its higher selectivity toward BO (94 vs. 53%). The higher specific activity of B-LPO could be attributed to its higher surface area. This is supported by similar values for the ratio of specific activity (B-LPO/N-LPO=5.9) and the ratio of surface area (B-LPO/N-LPO=6.9). On the other hand, selectivity is more closely related to acidic-basic properties of a catalyst. It was reported that both acidic and basic sites are required for the formation of unsaturated alcohols, while strong acidic sites facilitate the formation of carbonyl compounds [11,12]. It was also known that B-LPO contained weaker acidic sites than N-LPO, resulting in lower selectivity toward carbonyl compounds [11]. The weaker acidic strength of B-LPO can be related to remaining Na ions in B-LPO. In the characterization results, we found that the Na atoms in B-LPO were located on the surface, and the chemical state of the Na atoms was similar to that of Na in Na-exchanged zeolites. In the reaction results, B-LPO showed much less formation of MEK that is the product via acid catalyzed reaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the role of Na atoms in B-LPO is eliminating Brønsted acidic site. Using B-LPO, we further explored the effect of H2O on catalytic activity. Fig. 4 A shows the variations in the specific BO formation rate as a function of H2O partial pressure. The presence of H2O considerably suppressed the specific formation rate of BO. When the H2O partial pressure was gradually increased from 0 to 62kPa, the specific formation rate of BO was decreased from 20.4 to 11.2mmolBO/gcat h, while the selectivity values were merely influenced. When we compared the apparent activation energy of BO formation with and without H2O flow (Fig. 4B), almost identical values were found in both cases. The apparent activation energies were estimated to be 102 and 108kJ/mol, respectively for 0 and 40kPa of H2O partial pressure. Since H2O is not involved in the isomerization of EB to BO, and the presence of H2O did not alter the selectivity values and the activation energies, the effect of H2O cannot be caused by a change of neither the reaction mechanism nor the active site structure. A preoccupation (or poisoning) of the active site by H2O is a more reasonable cause for the adverse effect of H2O. Therefore, an active site for the formation of BO strongly binds to H2O. Stability of B-LPO catalyst was also tested, and no deactivation was observed for 10h of reaction (Fig. S3). 3.3 Identification of the active surface Through experimental analyses, we found that acid sites over LPO surface were eliminated by Na atoms (B-LPO), and H2O is strongly bound by an active site for BO formation. With these results, DFT calculations were performed to find an active surface for isomerization into BO. 3.3.1 Stable geometries for B-LPO surface Various geometries for (001), (010), and (100) surfaces were explored with consideration for surface oxidation and hydroxylation. Fig. 5 shows the most stable surface geometries at a relevant range of temperature (300–1000K). Details in finding the thermodynamically stable geometries are discussed in the Supporting information (Figs. S4–S11). The most stable (001) surface exposes under-coordinated (three-fold coordination) Li atoms, apical O atoms (PO), and hydroxyl group (POH) (Fig. 5A). Surface hydroxyl density for the most stable geometry is 0.77OH/nm2. The bonding between the apical O atom and the P atom is contracted to some extent compared with the bulk PO bond length (1.49Å compared with 1.56Å of bulk LPO), which is attributed to the formation of a PO double bond. The bond length between P atom and O atom in POH group is 1.61Å. For the (010) surface, a geometry that exposes three-fold coordinated Li and O atoms was calculated to be the most stable (Fig. 5B). No distinct changes in the atomic positions were observed upon surface relaxation for this surface. Further surface oxidation or hydroxylation was an unfavorable process. In contrast to the aforementioned planes, termination of the (100) plane exposes unstable polar surface due to an alternate stacking of the [Li2O2]2− and [LiPO2]2+ layers (Fig. S5). Surface hydroxylation has been reported to stabilize the instability from the polar stacking [26]. For the most stable (100) surface (Fig. 5C), the hydroxyl density is 3.9 OH/nm2, and three-fold coordinated Li and O atoms are present. Considering the structural differences among the three surfaces, the P-OH group on the (001) surface is important to note, as this moiety can act as an acid site. The (100) surface also contains protons, but these protons are rather basic because they are attached to OLi. Therefore, POH group on (001) surface is plausible active site for the formation of MEK. As we observed in characterization results, Na ions were dispersed on the surface of B-LPO. Therefore, plausible exchange site for Na atom was also explored on (001) and (100) surfaces, and the results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6 . Exchange energies for (001) and (100) surfaces are compared in Table 2. The negative value of exchange energy for (001) surface indicates that Na-exchange on (001) surface is energetically favored. In contrast, considerably higher exchange energy for (100) surface means that Na-exchange on this surface is unfavorable process. Therefore, probable location of Na ions in B-LPO is on (001) surface. These results also support that the POH group on (001) surface is the active site for the formation of MEK. 3.3.2 Adsorption of H2O on the stable surface geometries We found the most stable surface geometries for three planes considering surface oxidation, hydroxylation, and Na-exchange. On these surface models, the adsorption strength of H2O was compared to find the plausible active surface for the isomerization of EB to BO. The most strongly adsorbed geometries are shown in Fig. 7 . On the (001)Na surface, the under-coordinated Li sites were the preferential adsorption sites (Fig. 7A). H2O is adsorbed on the bridge position between two under-coordinated Li atoms, and two hydrogen bonds are formed with the nearest two PO groups. The adsorption strength is −105kJ/mol. With respect to the (010) surface (Fig. 7B), hydrogen bonding is the more important driving force for adsorption rather than interaction with the under-coordinated Li site. In the most stable adsorbed geometry, no chemisorption occurs, but two hydrogen bonds give rise to −81kJ/mol of an adsorption strength. Adsorption of H2O on (100) surface involves chemisorption on under-coordinated Li atom and two hydrogen bonding with surface hydroxyl group and under-coordinated O atom (Fig. 7C). The adsorption strength is −83kJ/mol. The values of the free energy of H2O adsorption are compared in Fig. 7D. Partial pressure of H2O (pH2O =20–62kPa) was also considered, and the reaction temperature in Fig. 4A (598K) is indicated by blue line. It clearly shows that the adsorption of H2O on the (001)Na surface is much stronger than that on (010) and (100) surfaces. Furthermore, the values for free energy of adsorption for (010) and (100) surface are ranging from 26 to 31kJ/mol, which are too weak to affect the catalytic activity. Consequently, the (001)Na surface is the most plausible active surface for the isomerization of EB to BO among the explored surfaces. 3.4 Vibrational frequencies and FTIR analysis In order to confirm the presence of the surface moieties, vibrational frequencies for the surfaces models were calculated, and experimental FTIR analyses were carried out. Table 3 summarizes the calculated characteristic frequencies for (001)Na as well as the H2O adsorbed geometries. For a bare surface, two frequencies, 1144 and 977cm−1, appeared from the stretching modes of the PO bond and the PO4 group, respectively. When H2O is adsorbed onto (001)Na, a considerable variation in frequency for the PO bond stretching mode occurs. The formation of hydrogen bonding between PO and H2O results in an elongation of the PO bond (1.49Å→1.52Å), and leads to a decrease in the ν(PO) frequencies (1144→1115–1122cm−1). Fig. 8 A shows the experimental FTIR spectrum for the B-LPO catalyst. The broad peak at 3500–3000cm−1 can be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of highly hydrogen-bonded H2O molecules and hydroxyl groups on a surface [19]. The small and complex peaks at 3600–3750cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups that do not form hydrogen bonds [27]. The bending modes of physisorbed H2O gave rise to the absorption near 1650cm−1. In addition, the peaks at the lower frequencies (1500–1350cm−1) can be assigned to the perturbed bending modes of H2O molecules. This frequency range is similar to the bending frequency of H2O in geometry B. Small peaks were observed at 1250 and 1228cm−1, verifying the presence of a PO double bond [28]. The bulk phonon modes of the PO4 group in LPO gave rise to the strong absorption at 1010cm−1 [28] (Fig. S12), which made it difficult to identify the calculated absorption corresponding to the PO double bond that forms hydrogen bonding (1115–1122cm−1). As the temperature was ramped up, absorptions at 1220 and 1260cm−1 gradually increased (Fig. 8C top) while the absorption related to adsorbed H2O decreased (Fig. 8B). For a clear observation, the sample was first cooled to room temperature to exclude the thermal contribution in IR absorption, and then the spectrum was acquired (Fig. 8C bottom). The spectrum clearly showed increased levels of absorption at 1208 and 1260cm−1. The increased absorption indicated that the surface model (001)Na (or at least a similar structure) existed in the B-LPO catalyst (Table 3). 3.5 The role of surface moieties Through the vibrational frequency calculations and FTIR analyses, it was confirmed that a structure resembling (001)Na was present under the reaction temperatures. In order to understand the role of the surface moieties on this surface, the adsorption of EB and corresponding change in the electron density were calculated. Fig. 9 A and B show the most stable geometry whereby EB is adsorbed on the (001)Na surface. This geometry was found via systematic exploration of adsorption sites on the surface and then rotation of the EB at the identified site. The adsorption energy is −121kJ/mol. Oxygen in the epoxide group interacts with two under-coordinated Li atoms, and the distances between the surface Li atoms and Oepoxide are 2.25 and 2.38Å. The CO bond lengths in the epoxide ring is elongated to 1.50 and 1.47Å from 1.45Å, which indicates that surface Li sites activates the CO bond upon adsorption. It is also noteworthy that the surface PO group is in close proximity to the terminal hydrogen of EB (PO⋯HC distance 2.27Å). The difference in the electron density contour shows that a significant change occurs in the electron density upon adsorption (Fig. 9C and D). In particular, electron density in the space between epoxy oxygen and surface Li sites is increased considerably, which means that the interaction between them is the major driving force for the adsorption. The terminal hydrogen and the apical oxygen (Oap) also show a change in electron density. These redistribution of electron density and the resultant electrostatic force cause the strong adsorption of EB on the surface. Based on the adsorbed geometry and the change in the electron density, we proposed roles for the moieties on the surface of lithium phosphate. The significant moieties on the surface of LPO were under-coordinated Li atoms and the apical oxygen of phosphate. The former moiety plays a role of adsorbing EB by strongly binding the epoxy oxygen, and of activating the CO bonds of an epoxide ring. The latter interacts with a hydrogen atom attached to the terminal carbon of EB. This presumably receives a proton from the EB molecule for the formation of a CC double bond, and then transfer the proton to the epoxy oxygen. 4 Conclusions The active surface of the basic lithium phosphate (B-LPO) catalyst for the isomerization of trans-2,3-epoxybutane to 3-buten-2-ol was identified based on experimental and theoretical results. The experimental characterization and the reaction results indicated that the active surface strongly binds H2O molecules, and dispersed Na ions on B-LPO surface suppress the formation of acid sites. Based on the DFT results, the (001) surface whose acidic proton (POH) is exchanged with Na atom was proposed as plausible active surface for the reaction. The presence of the (001) surface was confirmed via FT-IR analysis. The roles of the surface moieties on the (001) surface were proposed on the basis of the adsorbed geometry of trans-2,3-epoxybutane and according to the charge density contours. The under-coordinated Li sites activate the CO bond of an epoxide ring, and the surface PO moieties receive a proton from the terminal carbon.

        "dc:description": "Basic lithium phosphate (B-LPO) catalyst selectively produces unsaturated alcohols from epoxides. The catalytic activity of B-LPO is known to originate from appropriate acidic-basic properties, but no details were available on the structure of the active site. In this study, experimental methods and DFT calculations were performed in an attempt to identify the active surface structure of B-LPO for the isomerization of 2,3-epoxybutane to 3-buten-2-ol. The experimental results showed that exchanged Na ions in B-LPO suppressed the formation of an acid-catalyzed by-product (methyl ethyl ketone). In addition, H2O had a negative effect on the formation of 3-buten-2-ol due to the preoccupation of the active site. DFT calculations in conjunction with these experimental observations showed that the most plausible active surface for the formation of 3-buten-2-ol is the (001) surface of LPO whose acidic proton is exchanged with Na atom. On this surface, the under-coordinated Li atoms and the surface PO groups are exposed, and these play a role in activating the CO bond of an epoxide ring, and in receiving a proton from the terminal carbon, respectively.",
