Keywords Levulinic acid Ethyl levulinate Cerium exchanged phosphotungstic acid 1 Introduction Nowadays, the catalytic synthesis of value-added biomass platform chemicals has attracted much attention [1–3]. Among of these biomass based platform compounds, ethyl levulinate (EL) maintained high chemical activity due to a carbonyl and an ester group in its molecular structure. Nowadays, EL are widely used in medicine and health, perfumes, elasticizers and other industries. In addition, EL was also used as a novel form of liquid fuel additive, which would dramatically reduce the depletion of fossil energy [4–6]. The conventional method for production of EL is esterification of levulinic acid (LA) with ethanol accompanied with acid catalyst, such as HCl, H3PO4 and H2SO4 and so on [7–9]. These catalysts have been phased out because they gradually appeared environmental problems, and sulfated metal oxides, ion exchange resins, zeolites, supported heteropoly acids, etc were extensively applied to this reaction [10–16]. Among of these solid acid catalysts, Keggin type heteropoly acids (HPAs) has been the focus of considerable attention due to its tunable acidity as well as the uniform strong acidic sites [16,17]. Although HPAs are useful acid catalysts, the low specific surface area, high solubility in polar solvents and difficult to separate from polar media limit its potential catalytic performance [17]. Exchange of HPAs's protons (H+) with metal ions to form HPAs salt and grafting it onto porous support is often used to enhance its surface area, acidity and decrease its solubility in polar solvents [18]. Thus, the metal ions and support play an important role on the catalytic performance of the final catalyst. Very recently, several kinds metal cations were used to exchange the protons of HPAs to form HPAs salts [18,19]. Among of these HPAs salts, Cs salt of phosphotungstates are well-known for its high thermal stability (≥500°C) and water tolerance [20]. However, the tendency to form milky colloid in polar solvent resulting them hard to be anchored on suitable supports. Thus it is still of great interest to exploit an efficient kind of metal salt of HPAs. Cerium is one of the most used rare earth element to be used as catalysis material, and Ce salt of HPAs has been applied for various reactions [21,22]. Generally, the powder forms of ZrO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 have been used to supported the HPAs salts and displayed well performance [20,23,24]. However, if these powder catalysts were to be used in the industrial scale, it must be pelletized with a binder, which can produce a remarkable influence on the overall acidic properties of the catalyst and thus the final catalytic performance [25]. Up to now, the synthesis of ethyl levulinate has been extensively described in flask or autoclave [8–10]. However, this batch process is a tedious process with high energy consumption, much waste of labor and thus hard to be used in an industrial process. These results encouraged us to built a continuous process for the synthesis of EL. So far, the continuous synthesis process for EL in fixed-bed reactor based on shaped catalyst was seldom reported. Among various HPAs, phosphotungstic acid (TPA) was selected in the present studies due to its strong acidic sites and higher water tolerance. Aim to establish an continuous synthesis process for EL in fixed-bed reactor, commercially silica-gel pellets was applied as support and Cerium salt of TPA catalysts were developed. The relationship of physicochemical properties and catalytic activity were investigated and the reaction parameters were optimized. Finally, the time on stream performance of the obtained catalyst was tested under the optimum reaction conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Phosphotungstic acid was purchased from Xiya Reagent (Shandong, China), levulinic acid and cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) were supplied by Macklin (shanghai, China), ethanol was provided from Iron Pagoda Reagent (Shandong, China). The above chemicals used were of A.R. grade. Silica gel pellets (SGP) was obtained from Hailang Silica-gel Dryer Factory (Qingdao, China). CeTPA supported on SGP was prepared by the method described below. 1.0mmol of TPA was dissolved in 20mL distilled water at room temperature and the cerium ion precursor 1.0mmol of Ce(NO3)3 was added to the former solution under continuous stirring. [Ce]3+: [PW12O40]3− molar ratio was adjusted to 1:1, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the Ce salt. After the solution of Ce salt was stirred for 1h, the excess water was removed on water bath. 10.0mL of aqueous solution of CeTPA (0.2g) was added drop wise to support SGP (2.0g). After impregnating for 4h, the catalysts was filtered and dried at 110°C for 6h. Then, the catalyst was impregnated with the aqueous solution residue for 4h again, next dried at 110°C for 6h. Finally the catalyst was calcined at 400°C for 4h. The catalysts were represented as x% CeTPA/SGP, where x represents the weight percentage of CeTPA on the catalyst. 2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 sorption curves of the catalysts were measured at 77K on Autosorb-IQ-C analyzer (Quantachrome, America). The elemental analysis of the samples was measured using an Optima-2000DV ICP atomic emission spectrometer. The XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained by PERSEE XD3 diffractometer using CuKa radiation at 36KV, 20mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected by a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. Acidity of the catalysts was determined via temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) using an automatic multi-purpose adsorption instrument TP-5080. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation The esterification of levulinic acid with ethanol was performed in a vertical fixed-bed reactor with stainless steel tube using 1.0mL catalyst (30mesh). The solution of levulinic acid in ethanol (the mole ratio of LA and ethanol 1:8) was swept into the reactor at flow rate of 0.1mL/min. The reaction mixture was collected and analyzed without preliminary separation by offline gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a SE-54 capillary column and FID detector. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The composition and textural properties CeTPA/SGP are listed in Table 1 . The surface area of CeTPA/SGP catalysts are smaller than that of the parent support. And with the increase of the CeTPA content, the surface area of CeTPA/SGP catalyst are decreased slightly as well as the pore volume. The variation in the sorption properties of the catalysts may be due to the pore blockage by supported CeTPA according to previous studies [17–19]. Fig. 1 . shows the XRD patterns of the parent support pure TPA, SGP and CeTPA supported catalysts. SGP support exhibits a broad peaks at 2θ range from 15° to 30°, demonstrated the amorphous behavior of the support, and the density of this diffraction peaks is reduced with the addition of CeTPA content. The diffraction peaks of Keggin ion of TPA can be observed on all the CeTPA supported catalysts at around 8.7°, demonstrated that the Keggin ion structure of TPA was kept unchanged in CeTPA/SGP catalysts [17–19]. Figs. 2–5 shows the XPS of Full XPS, W4f, P 2p and Ce 3d of 30% CeTPA/SGP catalyst. As can be found the Full XPS of CeTPA/SGP was similar with that of the pure TPA (Fig. S1). The W (VI) oxidation state peaks was observed on XPS spectra of W4f of the pure TPA (Fig. S2) at 36.2eV (W 4f7/2) and 38.4eV (W 4f5/2). The XPS spectra of W4f displayed that the W 4f binding energy values of W 4f7/2and W 4f5/2 of CeTPA/SGP were shifted to 35.8eV and 38.0eV respectively compared to that of the pure TPA. This may be caused by the interaction between the Keggin unit of CeTPA and the support [19,23]. The characteristic peaks of P (V) oxidation state at around 134.7eV confirmed the presence of P5+ oxidation state on the catalyst. Ce 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks were observed on Ce 3d XPS spectra of 30% CeTPA/SGP at around 882.1 and 901.5eV (Fig. 5), demonstrated that Ce ions were present mainly in the presence of Ce3+ states on the catalyst [26]. The NH3-TPD technique was used to compare the amount and strength of acid sites present on the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 , all catalysts displayed the desorption peaks of weak (150–300°C) and medium (300–500°C) acidic sites [27]. The acidity of the catalysts were calculated by the TPD peak and presented in Table 2 . Fig. 6 also displayed that with the increases of CeTPA loading, the ammonia desorption peaks of the medium acidic sites shifted to lower temperatures from 512.8°C to 482.2°C as well as the medium acid sites reduced to 0.046 from 0.093mmol NH3/g. Consequently, with the increased content of CeTPA on the catalysts, the weak acid sites increased to 0.128 from 0.396mmol NH3/g. 3.2 Catalytic activity The series of CeTPA/SGP catalysts were evaluated for the esterification of LA with ethanol. As shown in Table 3 , the pure support showed 12.4% LA conversion with 70.8% selectivity toward EL. By loading 10% CeTPA over SGP, conversion of LA increased to 43.5% and electivity toward EL reached 98.0%. Further increase in CeTPA loading over SGP drastically enhanced its activity, and conversion of LA reached about 90.2% over 30% CeTPA/SGP. Consequently, with the increased content of CeTPA on the catalysts, the formation of Angelica lactone was apparently restricted, leading to an increases on the selectivity toward EL. These catalytic activity results are in well accordance with the acidity results of NH3-TPD as shown in Table 2. Table 3 also displayed that 30% CeTPA/SGP and 40% CeTPA/SGP was no evidently variation in the conversion of LA and selectivity toward EL although the acidity of 40% CeTPA/SGP was higher. As shown in Table 1 the surface area and pore volume of 40% CeTPA/SGP are much lower than that of 30% CeTPA/SGP. Thus, the decrease in activity at higher loadings of CeTPA might be related to the poor dispersed of CeTPA on the support, which increased the diffusion limitation of LA to the inner acid sites of CeTPA/SGP and thus decreased the dehydration ability of the catalyst. The results demonstrated that the catalytic performance of these CeTPA/SGP catalysts is not directly related to the amount of CeTPA loading, but is attributed by the content of CeTPA and its dispersion on SGP. 3.3 Effect of reaction temperature It can be seen from Table 4 , the conversion of LA increased with the increase of the temperature. When the temperature increased to 160°C, the conversion of LA increased up to 90.2% and selectivity towards EL was 99.6%. However, when the temperature was above 160°C, the conversion and selectivity both were slightly reduced. Therefore, the optimum reaction temperature is 160°C. 3.4 Effect of LA to ethanol molar ratio Ethyl levulinate to ethanol molar ratio plays a vital role to obtain high LA conversion and EL selectivity. The effect of ethyl levulinate to ethanol molar ratio on the present reaction is shown in Fig. 7 . It is clear that, when the molar ratio of LA to ethanol descend from 1:6 to 1:10, the conversion of LA was increased from 86.8% to 98.9%. But the molar ratio further decreased from 1:10 to 1:12, it was slightly reduced in the LA conversion. The decrease in conversion may be due to the excess ethanol result in the dilution of LA that is adverse for the esterification of LA. It also can be found that the selectivity of EL was not affected by the effect of molar ratio and kept more than 99% of the value. These results suggest that the optimum molar ratio is 1:10. 3.5 Comparison with other phosphotungstic acid salts catalyst The catalytic performance of 30% CeTPA/SGP catalyst was compared with other reported TPA salts catalysts [19]. The results in Table S1 shows that the yield of EL were found to be 83.0% and 85.5% over 30% CsTPA/SGP and 30% LaTPA/SGP catalyst, respectively. In the case of the present 30% CeTPA/SGP conversion of LA was 98.9% and selectivity toward EL was 99.9%. Surely, the catalytic activity of Ce salt of TPA is higher than that of other metal salt of TPA catalysts. 3.6 The stability of catalyst In order to investigate the durability of 30% CeTPA/SGP, The continuous catalytic reaction was performed under the optimum conditions for 50h. As shown in Fig. 8 , for the duration of the test, conversion of LA and selectivity of EL remained at about 98.5% and 99.5%, respectively. The results demonstrated that 30% CeTPA/SGP displayed an excellent time on stream performance for continuous synthesis of ethyl levulinate. The time on stream performance of the 30% CeTPA/SGP was compared with that of 30% TPA/SGP. As displayed in Table 3 and Fig. S4, these two catalysts showed similar conversion of LA, but selectivity toward EL of Ce salt of TPA is higher than that of parent TPA supported on SGP. The main reason for the high selectivity of Ce salt of TPA is its quite lower number of strongly acidic protons on the surface than TPA/SGP, since the main by-product, angelica lactone is probably formed over strongly acidic sites. Fig. S4 also displays that the catalyst activity of 30% TPA/SGP remains at an almost constant value for the first 10h of TOS, and then shows a gradual decreases during the next 40h of TOS, as demonstrated by a large decreases in the conversion of LA from 95.6% to 60.7%. These results indicated that Ce salt of TPA catalyst is more robust than TPA catalyst for the esterification reaction. In order to further investigate the stability of 30% CeTPA/SGP, the spent catalyst after 50h of TOS was characterized and compared with the fresh catalyst. The FI-IR, XRD patterns and textural property of the spent 30% CeTPA/SGP were similar to those of the fresh 30% CeTPA/SGP catalyst as shown in Fig. S5, Fig. S6 and Table S2, indicating that the structure of 30% CeTPA/SGP was maintained during the catalytic reaction. 4 Conclusions A continuous process for synthesis of ethyl levulinate under atmospheric pressure, based on cerium salts of TPA supported on commercially silica-gel pellets catalysts is presented as a new and efficient method. The characterization results indicated that the CeTPA supported SGP catalysts remained the Keggin structure and Ce was present on the catalyst in the presence of Ce3+. The activity results are directly related to the dispersion of CeTPA and the acidity. The obtained catalyst, 30% CeTPA/SGP catalyst exhibited 98.5% LA conversion with 99.5% selectivity for EL within 50h of Time on stream at the optimum conditions. Thus, the obtained catalyst in the present studies is rather durable and holds the potential for practical applications.
