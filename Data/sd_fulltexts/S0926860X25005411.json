The development of cost-effective and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Fe-Co-NC) through a multi-step strategy involving the spray pyrolysis of a bimetallic oxide precursor, followed by a solvent-free solid-state reaction to form an Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67), and subsequent pyrolysis. A systematic investigation revealed that the pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, and 900 °C) critically influences the structural properties, elemental composition, and electrochemical performance of the catalyst. The catalyst prepared at 700 ℃ (Fe-Co-NC-700) exhibited the most promising results, featuring a high specific surface area (510.8 m2 g-1), abundant pyridinic-N active sites, and uniformly dispersed Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles. Consequently, Fe-Co-NC-700 demonstrated superior bifunctional activity, with a high ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.82V and favorable OER kinetics. When incorporated into a ZAB half-cell, the Fe-Co-NC-700 cathode delivered the smallest charge-discharge voltage gap and exceptional long-term cycling stability for over 150 cycles at 20mAcm-2. In contrast, catalysts pyrolyzed at higher temperatures suffered from the aggregation of the metal active sites, leading to rapid performance degradation. This study highlights a controllable synthesis pathway for fabricating durable, high-performance catalysts for next-generation energy storage devices.

Among various technologies, metal-air batteries have attracted significant attention due to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density [1–3]. In particular, the aqueous zinc-air battery (ZAB) has emerged as a promising candidate for applications from portable electronics to electric vehicles, as it offers the advantages of high theoretical energy density (1300–1400Wh/kg based on Zn) with low cost, intrinsic safety, and the natural abundance of zinc [4–7]. Despite these desirable features, the practical use of rechargeable ZABs has been hindered by significant challenges such as low power density, poor cycle stability, and large charge-discharge voltage gaps. These issues lead to low round-trip energy efficiency. The origin of this performance challenge is the sluggish kinetics of two crucial electrochemical reactions at the air cathode: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging [8–10]. Therefore, the rational design of a high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst that simultaneously accelerates both the OER and ORR is key to advancing rechargeable ZAB technology. To overcome the kinetic barriers of the OER and ORR, bifunctional electrocatalyst should be highly active, durable, and cost-effective. Although precious metals such as platinum (Pt) and iridium/ruthenium oxides (IrO₂, RuO₂) exhibit benchmark activities for ORR and OER, respectively, they are typically monofunctional and prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications due to their scarcity [11–14]. As a result, extensive efforts have been focused on developing catalysts based on earth-abundant transition metals. Among these, cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) based materials have emerged as the leading candidates. The high performance of Co-Fe materials is attributed to a powerful synergistic effect: the introduction of Fe effectively modulates the electronic d-band structure of Co sites, promoting the formation of highly active high-valence Co species [15–19]. Furthermore, integrating these bimetallic active sites with a conductive support, such as nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) further improves catalytic activity. The NC matrix not only enhances electrical conductivity to accelerate reaction kinetics but also physically anchors the metal nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation and leaching during cycling, thereby significantly improving long-term durability [20,21]. Realizing the synergistic potential of Co-Fe-NC catalysts requires a precursor that enables precise atomic-level control over the composition and architecture of the final catalyst. In this context, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as ideal sacrificial templates. MOFs are crystalline porous materials constructed from metal nodes and organic linkers, ensuring a perfectly homogeneous atomic-scale distribution of metal species. During pyrolysis, the organic linkers are converted into a porous carbon matrix, while the metal nodes are transformed into uniformly dispersed, catalytically active sites (e.g., metal nanoparticles or M-N-C moieties which is the structures where a metal atom (M) is coordinated to nitrogen (N) and carbon (C)) [22–25]. The approach of using MOFs as sacrificial templates yields catalysts with high surface area and controlled porosity, which are crucial for efficient mass transport and accessibility to active sites. Among MOFs, Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) are particularly noteworthy for their exceptional thermal and chemical stability. Specifically, cobalt-based ZIF-67 is an outstanding precursor for generating high-density Co-N-C active sites. Furthermore, its morphology can be engineered into advanced structures, such as hollow nanocages, to enhance mass transfer for high-performance energy devices like zinc-air batteries [26–29]. Nevertheless, achieving homogeneous doping with a secondary metal like iron (Fe) in ZIF-67 is a considerable challenge. Conventional solvothermal co-precipitation methods often lead to phase separation due to the different reaction kinetics of cobalt and iron salts. These methods also generate large volumes of hazardous organic waste, raising environmental concerns [30–33]. To address these issues, recent research has focused on strategies like the direct synthesis of bimetallic ZIFs or the development of facile synthesis routes [35,36]. Building on this concept, we propose an innovative two-stage strategy to simultaneously address the critical challenges of homogeneous doping and clean synthesis. In the first stage, spray pyrolysis is employed to pre-engineer a bimetallic Fe-Co oxide precursor with atomic-level homogeneity, thereby ensuring precise control of the metal ratio from the outset [37–39]. In the second stage, this well-mixed oxide enables a direct, solvent-free solid-state reaction with 2-methylimidazole, eliminating the need for organic solvents and the generation of hazardous organic waste [40–42]. This synergistic approach not only ensures uniform doping but also adheres to green chemistry principles. The resulting Fe-Co-NC catalyst, derived from pyrolyzed ZIF-based precursors, exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, it delivers superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.82V, favorable OER kinetics, and remarkable long-term cycling stability exceeding 150 cycles at 20mAcm-2 in a ZAB half-cell. This rational synthesis strategy combining a spray-pyrolyzed oxide precursor design and solvent-free ZIF formation provides a novel and controllable pathway toward high performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable ZABs. 2 Experimental Method 2.1 Chemicals Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.5%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, ≧ 85%) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO, 99.9%) were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Chemical Co., Ltd. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99.0%) was purchased from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. 2-methylimidazole (98%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C (19.3%) was purchased from TANAKA Precious Metals Industry Co., Ltd. Iridium (IV) oxide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All aqueous solutions were prepared using high-purity deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm). 2.2 Preparation of Fe-ZIF-67 First, Fe-Co oxide precursor was prepared via spray pyrolysis. A 500mL aqueous solution containing 0.1M Co(NO3)2 and 10 at% FeCl3·6H2O (relative to Co) was atomized using an ultrasonic nebulizer and subsequently carried by N₂ carrier gas (3L/min) through a tube furnace preheated to 600 °C. After 6h of operation, the resulting Fe-Co oxide powder was collected at the furnace outlet using a filter. Secondly, the collected Fe-Co oxide powder was ground with solid 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) at Co:2-MIM molar ratio of 3:8. The solid mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 170 °C for 24h under solvent-free conditions. The Fe-ZIF-67 product was washed with methanol to remove unreacted 2-MIM and dried at room temperature. 2.3 Preparation of Fe-Co-NC The as-synthesized Fe-ZIF-67 powder was used as a precursor to fabricate a series of porous carbon materials. In a typical procedure, 100mg of Fe-ZIF-67 powder was placed in an alumina boat and heated to 700, 800, and 900 °C for 2hours in a tube furnace under N2 atmosphere. The resulting materials were denoted as Fe-Co-NC-700, -800, -900. After pyrolysis, the samples were treated with 1M hydrochloric acid (HCl), washed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. 2.4 Electrochemical Measurement The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was evaluated using a standard three-electrode cell. The measurements were conducted with a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) setup and a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko, HZ7000) in a 0.1M aqueous KOH electrolyte. A catalyst-coated glassy carbon (GC) disk (area: 0.196 cm2), a platinum wire and an Hg/HgO electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst powder (10mgmL-1) in a water/ethanol mixed solvent containing 2.5vol% Nafion via ultrasonication. This ink was drop-casted onto the GC disk in four 5µL aliquots and dried to prepare the working electrode with a catalyst loading of ~1.02mgcm-2 . For ORR analysis, the electrolyte was first saturated with N₂ to record a background voltammogram data. The electrolyte was then saturated with O₂, and ORR polarization curves were recorded via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from 1.1 to 0.05V (vs. RHE) with scan rate of 10mV/s at various rotation speeds (400 – 2500rpm). During the ORR scan, the Pt ring potential was held constant at 1.2V vs. RHE to detect peroxide species. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis, an anodic LSV scan was subsequently recorded from 1.1 to 1.7V with scan rate of 2mV/s in same electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in the potential range of 1.0 – 1.2V vs. RHE at sweep rates from 20 to 100mVs-1 over five cycles in 0.1M KOH aqueous solution to evaluate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The ECSA was estimated from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was determined by plotting the slope of ΔJ (Ja – Jb) at 1.1V vs. RHE against the sweep rate. The electron transfer number (n) during the ORR was calculated from RRDE measurements using the disk and ring currents using the following Eq. (1), where I d is disc current, I r is ring current and N is the ring collection efficiency: (1) n = 4 ∣ I d ∣ ∣ I d ∣ + ( ∣ I r ∣ / N ) Tafel plots were derived from the mass-transport-corrected polarization curves for both the ORR and OER. The Tafel slope (b) was determined by fitting the linear region of the plot of overpotential (η = |E - 1.23V|) versus the logarithm of the kinetic current density (J). Electrochemical charge-discharge performance was measured using battery test equipment (Hokuto Denko). The test cell was constructed using a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) loaded with either Fe-Co-NC-700 or a benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 as the positive electrode, a 30mg zinc foil as the counter electrode, and 1.4mL of ZnO-saturated 8M KOH as the electrolyte. The charge and discharge cycling was carried out at a constant current density of 50mAcm-2 for 1hour per cycle under controlled temperature of 40 °C. Additionally, a half-cell evaluation was conducted. In this setup, a GDE was used as the positive electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, with 8M KOH as the electrolyte. The charge and discharge were performed for 1hour each at 40 °C. 2.5 Material Characterizations Crystal structures were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, RINT-2500, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (45kV, 200mA). Local atomic coordination environments were analyzed by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy at the Saga Light Source (Beamline BL06), and data processes for both the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were carried using Athena software. The morphology and microstructure were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7900F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-ARM200F, JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. The elemental distribution and composition (Fe, Co, N, C, and O) were analyzed using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Elemental ratio results were obtained by averaging the data from three different areas. Surface chemical states were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos ULTRA2, Al Kα source), calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8eV. Surface area and pore structure were determined using the Braeuer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from N₂ adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77K (Belsorp mini X). 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Characterization of electrocatalysts for ORR and OER Fe-Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon, denoted as Fe-Co-NC-T (where T = 700, 800, or 900 °C), were prepared via multi-step process. Initially, a bimetallic oxide precursor, Fe0.6 Co2.4 O4 was obtained through spray pyrolysis as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1). This oxide was subsequently converted into composite precursors consisting of ZIF-67 and Fe0.6 Co2.4 O4 via solvothermal treatment in a PTFE-lined autoclave with 2-methylimidazole (Fig. S1). The final Fe-Co-NC-T catalysts were obtained by calcining this precursor at varying temperatures (700, 800, or 900 °C) under an inert atmosphere, followed by acid washing with hydrochloric acid (HCl). The XRD measurements before and after acid treatment revealed a reduction in the intensities of Co, Fe, and Fe-Co alloy peaks, attributed to the removal of unstable or excess metallic species (Fig. S2). The crystal structures of the final Fe-Co-NC-T catalysts were investigated using XRD as shown in Fig. 1a. All samples exhibited a broad peak centered at approximately 26°, corresponding to graphitic carbon (PDF card No. 00-041-1487), which is formed from the thermal decomposition of the 2-methylimidazole organic linker. The intensity and sharpness of this peak increased with higher pyrolysis temperatures, indicating enhanced crystallinity. In addition, distinct diffraction peaks for metallic Co (PDF card No. 00-015-0806), Fe-Co alloy (PDF card No. 00-049-1567) were observed, confirming successful reduction of the metal oxide precursor during calcination. The diffraction pattern of metallic Fe (PDF card No. 01-081-8766) substantially overlaps with that of Co. However, because the proportion of Co in the Fe0.6Co2.4O3 precursor exceeds that of Fe, the formation of metallic Co is more likely [40]. Notably, the intensity of the diffraction peaks corresponding to Fe-Co alloy phase decreased at higher calcination temperature. Elevated calcination temperatures significantly enhance the surface and bulk diffusion of metal atoms and nanoparticles, thereby facilitating migration, aggregation, and Ostwald ripening on the carbon support, ultimately leading to particle growth [41]. The textural properties of the Fe-Co catalysts were evaluated by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. 1b). All samples exhibited type-IV isotherms with clear hysteresis loop in the relative pressure (P/P 0 ) range of 0.4 – 1.0, which is characteristic of mesoporous structures. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were calculated to be 510.8, 293.4, and 205.9 m2g-1 for Fe-Co-NC-700, -800, and -900, respectively. Pore size distribution analysis (Fig. S3) reveals that Fe-Co-NC-700 possessed the highest micropores and mesopores volume. As the calcination temperatures increases to 800 and 900 °C, microporosity and total pore volume was significantly reduced. This trend is attributed to the partial collapse and sintering of the ZIF-67-derived porous carbon framework at elevated pyrolysis temperatures. While higher temperatures promote graphitization, they also compromise the intricate porosity, causing a diminished surface area. Measurements were conducted to determine the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), estimated from the electrical double-layer capacitance obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves and the corresponding plots of current density variation with scan rate, used to determine double-layer capacitance, as presented in Fig. S4 and S5, respectively. The calculated ECSA values for each sample were 2.72 mF cm-2 for Fe-Co-NC-700, 0.62 mF cm-2 for Fe-Co-NC-800, and 0.52 mF cm-2 for Fe-Co-NC-900. A clear trend of decreasing ECSA with increasing calcination temperature was observed, consistent with the specific surface area determined from BET measurements, indicating that calcination temperature strongly influences surface area. To further understand the morphological changes associated with the decrease in Fe-Co alloy diffraction intensity, the catalysts were examined using electron microscopy. The decrease of diffraction intensity is attributed to temperature-dependent changes in the particle composition and stability, potentially leading to phase separation and the loss of metallic species during the acid treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed that all samples, Fe-Co-NC-700, Fe-Co-NC-800, and Fe-Co-NC-900, retained the polyhedral morphology characteristic of ZIF-derived structure, with no evidence of large aggregated metal particles ( Fig. 2a-c). Elemental distribution was investigated via SEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) mapping (Fig. S6). While C, N, and Co were uniformly distributed in all samples, the distribution of Fe exhibited clear temperature dependence: Fe remained uniformly dispersed in Fe-Co-NC-700 and -800, but, aggregated into iron-rich domains in Fe-Co-NC-900. Bulk elemental compositions determined by SEM-EDS (Table S1) show that calcination temperature significantly influences the final material composition. The residual metal content displayed an opposite trend: Fe-Co-NC-700 retained the highest concentrations of Co (11.9 at%) and Fe (2.9 at%). Previous studies have reported that during the calcination of ZIF-67, Co particles migrate within the N-doped carbon matrix [42]. This behavior can be explained by the fact that, as the calcination temperature increases, Fe and Co particles or their alloys tend to migrate out of the carbon matrix and are subsequently removed through acid treatment. In contrast, all samples were predominantly composed of C and N. Notably, Fe-Co-NC-900 exhibited the highest N content (14.2 at%), indicating more efficient N-doping at 900 ℃. At a calcination temperature of 700 ℃, considerable amounts of Co and Fe remained, resulting in relatively lower proportions of C, N, and O compositions. Compared with 800 ℃, the higher N content at 900 ℃ can be attributed to further graphitization, as indicated by Raman measurements, during which N is incorporated into the structure. In addition, ZIF-67 is generally known to be stable under acidic conditions [43]. Due to this property, at lower calcination temperatures, the residual bonds between Co and N were partially removed during acid treatment. These results indicate that higher calcination temperatures promote the selective removal of unstable metallic phases, thereby altering the overall metal composition during the acid treatment. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was employed to examine the material’s nanostructures (Fig. S7). It confirms that the metallic nanoparticles are well dispersed and encapsulated within the N-doped carbon matrix, forming a core-shell structure. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging elucidated the effect of temperature on the nanoparticle size and dispersion (Fig. 2d-f). Fe-Co-NC-700 contained uniformly distributed small nanoparticles. At 800 °C, mild particle aggregation began to appear, while Fe-Co-NC-900 exhibited pronounced sintering and growth of larger and more distinct particles. STEM-EDS elemental mapping confirmed that Fe and Co were co-localized within the same nanoparticles, suggesting the formation of Fe-Co alloys structures (Fig. S8). The presence of oxygen in the same regions further implies the existence of thin surface oxide layer. A statistical analysis of the particle size distribution was performed using HAADF-STEM images (Fig. S9). The average nanoparticle sizes of Fe-Co-NC-700, Fe-Co-NC-800, and Fe-Co-NC-900 were determined to be 12, 8, and 13nm, respectively. Interestingly, the particle size exhibited a non-monotonic trend, with a minimum size at 800 °C. Meanwhile, the total number of observable nanoparticles decreased steadily with increasing temperature. This reduction can be attributed to two main mechanisms: (1) thermal sintering, which causes particles to merge, and (2) the removal of unstable metallic phases during acid leaching. These trends are consistent with the XRD and SEM-EDS results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to investigate the chemical bonding states of nitrogen, which are critical to the catalytic activity. The high-resolution N 1s spectra of Fe-Co-NC-700, -800, and -900 are presented in Fig. 3a–c. Each spectrum was deconvoluted into four components: pyridinic-N (~399eV), graphitic-N (~401eV), and oxidized-N (~404eV) [44–46]. Among these, pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N are widely considered as key active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while graphitic-N enhances electrical conductivity and thermal stability of the carbon support [47,48]. A clear temperature-dependent trend is observed: with increasing calcination temperature from 700 to 900 °C, the relative content of graphitic-N increases. It suggests a thermally driven conversion from the less stable pyrrolic configuration to the more stable graphitic configuration. These results highlight the importance of calcination temperature for tuning the catalyst properties. An optimal catalyst must balance high density of active N species (pyridinic and pyrrolic) with improved conductivity and durability provided by graphitic-N. On other hand, the Raman ID/IG ratio decreased with increasing calcination temperature, with values of Fe-Co-NC-700 = 1.16, Fe-Co-NC-800 = 1.03, and Fe-Co-NC-900 = 0.93. This trend reflects the enhanced graphitization of carbon at higher temperatures, which reduces defect density (Fig. S10). These findings are consistent with the XPS N 1s spectra, which show an increase in graphitic-N intensity with higher calcination temperature. Fe-Co-NC-700, which exhibited the highest pyridinic-N content, was selected for further analysis. Given that the binding energy of pyridinic-N is close to that of potential metal-nitrogen (M-Nx) bonds, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to probe the local coordination environment of the Co and Fe atoms and determine the possible formation of M-Nx species [46]. The Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of Fe-Co-NC-700 is shown in Fig. S11a. The absorption edge energy is located between metallic Co foil (Co0) and cobalt oxides (e.g., CoO, Co3O4), indicating a mixed oxidation state (+2 to +3). However, the corresponding Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum (Fig. S11b) does not show a significant peak for Co-N/O coordination (~1.4Å). Instead, it is dominated by a prominent Co-Co peak at ~2.2Å, which is characteristic of metallic Co. These results suggest that Co exists primarily as metallic clusters with a partially oxidized surface, rather than as atomically dispersed Co-Nx moieties. A parallel analysis was performed at the Fe K-edge. The XANES spectrum in Fig. S11c shows that the absorption edge of Fe is placed between metallic Fe foil (Fe0) and Fe2O3 (Fe3+), confirming partial oxidation. Importantly, the EXAFS spectrum (Fig. S11d) shows no peaks for Fe-N/O coordination (~1.5Å) and Fe-Fe metallic bond (~2.2Å). The absence of Fe-Fe signal implies Fe does not exist as isolated single atoms or metallic Fe nanoparticles. Combined with the Co EXAFS results, it suggests Fe is incorporated into Co-rich metallic alloy nanoparticles. These results with XPS and XAS analysis demonstrate that Fe and Co in the Fe-Co-NC-700 catalyst are not individually coordinated with N to form M-Nx single-atom sites. Instead, they form Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles embedded in a N-doped carbon matrix. 3.2 ORR and OER performance The ORR activity of the prepared catalysts were evaluated using LSV in O2-saturated 0.1M KOH solution in Fig. 4a. Commercial Pt/C (20wt%) was used as a benchmark. As expected, the Pt/C catalyst demonstrated superior activity, exhibiting a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.89V vs. RHE. Among the synthesized Fe-Co-NC materials, Fe-Co-NC-700 showed the best performance achieving an E1/2 of 0.82V, which approaches the Pt/C standard and is significantly higher than those of Fe-Co-NC-800 and -900 (both 0.80V). Notably, the Fe-free control sample, Co-NC-700, exhibited an even higher E1/2 of 0.83V (Fig. S12a), highlighting the strong ORR activity of Co-based sites. Furthermore, compositional analysis reveals that Co-NC-700 contained the highest Co content, suggesting that Co serves as one of the active sites for ORR [49]. Tafel slope analysis was used to further assess the ORR kinetics (Fig. 4b). The Pt/C catalyst exhibited a Tafel slope of 67mV dec⁻¹, indicating rapid reaction kinetics. Fe-Co-NC-700 showed the lowest Tafel slope (80mV dec⁻¹) among the prepared catalysts, confirming its favorable kinetic behavior. In contrast, the slopes for Fe-Co-NC-800 (104mV dec⁻¹), Fe-Co-NC-900 (106mV dec⁻¹), and Co-NC-700 (103mV dec⁻¹) were significantly higher, reflecting slower reaction rates (Fig. S12b). The ORR selectivity was examined via rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. In alkaline media, ORR can proceed via a desirable four-electron pathway (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−) or undesirable two-electron pathway generating peroxide intermediates (O2 + H2 O + 2e− → HO2 − + OH−). As shown in Fig. S13, the limiting current density for all catalysts increased with the rotation speed (400 to 2500rpm), confirming that the reaction was limited by mass transport. The electron transfer number (n) was calculated from these data (Table S2). While Pt/C catalyst showed a near-perfect four-electron reduction with n ≈ 4.0, both Fe-Co-NC-700 and -800 showed high selectivity with n ≈ 3.8, indicating that the four-electron pathway predominates. In contrast, Fe-Co-NC-900 exhibited a lower n value of ~3.4, suggesting a higher contribution from the two-electron route. This reduced efficiency aligns with its composition (Table S1), which features a lower Co and higher Fe content conditions that appear to favor peroxide generation. Conversely, pyridinic-N has been reported to exhibit greater activity than graphitic-N [50]. In this investigation, XPS analysis (Fig. 3) confirmed that the proportion of pyridinic-N increases as the calcination temperature decreased. In contrast, although the sample prepared at 900 °C contained a higher proportion of graphitic-N, its ORR activity was inferior, and the number of electrons transferred was lower. Moreover, since both E1/2 and the Tafel slope correlated with the amount of pyridinic-N, the influence of nitrogen species on catalytic performance is clearly significant. Collectively, these results suggest that the superior ORR performance of Fe-Co-NC-700 arises not solely from the presence of Co, but from the synergistic contribution of abundant Co-derived sites and a carbon matrix enriched with pyridinic N. Next, to assess the bifunctional capabilities of the prepared materials, their OER performance was evaluated in 0.1M KOH solution. Here, commercial iridium oxide (IrO₂) was compared as a benchmark. Since the current density can be influenced by the surface area, the amount of supported catalyst, and the conductive additives, we investigated the optimal conditions for benchmark IrO2 catalysts in terms of catalyst loading and support materials (Fig. S14 and S15). As shown in Fig. 5a, all the Fe-Co-NC catalysts outperformed IrO2, requiring lower overpotentials to drive the OER.F Although the performance differences in comparison of all Fe-Co-NC catalysts prepared at different temperatures were relatively minor, the Fe-free control sample, Co-NC-700, exhibited a much higher overpotential. This result indicates that Fe incorporation significantly enhances the intrinsic OER activity of the catalyst. To further investigate the reaction kinetics, Tafel slopes were calculated from the OER polarization data (Fig. 5b). Fe-Co-NC-700 exhibited the most favorable kinetics with a Tafel slope of 109mV dec⁻¹. In contrast, Fe-Co-NC-800 displayed a higher slope of 148mV dec⁻¹, while Co-NC-700 showed poor kinetics with a slope of 267mV dec⁻¹ (Fig. S16). This finding leads the conclusion that Fe plays a key role in accelerating OER kinetics. Taken together, the ORR and OER results demonstrate that the Fe-Co-NC catalysts, particularly Fe-Co-NC-700, exhibit bifunctional electrocatalytic comparable to many state-of-the-art materials, underscoring their potential as cathode candidates for metal-air batteries (Table S3). 3.3 Cell test results and Catalyst degradation mechanism To evaluate the practical applicability of the synthesized Fe-Co-NC catalysts as cathodes in ZABs, charge-discharge characteristics were assessed. The charge-discharge polarization curves in Fig. 6a show that Fe-Co-NC-700 cell achieved the highest discharge voltage (ORR) and lowest charging voltage (OER), resulting in the smallest voltage gap across a range of current densities. For instance, at 50mAcm⁻², the voltage gap was as low as 1.1V, indicating the highest energy conversion efficiency among all catalysts. Next, long-term cycling stability was evaluated at a constant current density of 20mAcm⁻² (Fig. 6b). The Fe-Co-NC-700 cell demonstrated remarkable durability, maintaining stable charge and discharge voltages over more than 150 cycles. In contrast, the cells with Fe-Co-NC-800 and -900 showed poor stability, with their performance degrading significantly after approximately 20 and 10 cycles, respectively. To elucidate the cause of the degradation, the electrodes were observed using SEM-EDS after cycling test. Prior to testing, all samples exhibited a uniform elemental distribution (Fig. S17). However, after cycling, distinct changes were observed particularly Fe-Co-NC-800 and -900 (Fig. S18). While the elemental distribution in Fe-Co-NC-700 remained relatively homogeneous, Fe and Co were found to aggregate significantly in Fe-Co-NC-800 and -900 samples. These findings indicate that the migration and subsequent aggregation of metal atoms during the charge-discharge cycles lead to a loss of active area and decreased catalytic activity in Fe-Co-NC-800 and -900 samples. Elemental analysis from SEM-EDS measurement before and after cycling test corroborated these observations ( Tables 1 and 2). All Fe-Co-NC-700, -800, and -900 catalysts showed substantial nitrogen loss and reduced metal dispersion after cycling, consistent with oxidative degradation of the N-doped carbon matrix under OER conditions [51]. Notably, the Fe and Co contents decreased in the high-temperature samples (-800/-900), whereas Fe-Co-NC-700 retained its metal composition after cycling. This enhanced stability can be attributed to the carbon-shell encapsulation of alloy nanoparticles in Fe-Co-NC-700, which effectively suppresses metal leaching during operation. Although nitrogen functionalities may contribute to ORR/OER activity, our results indicate that the role of metal species is more dominant. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the Fe-Co-NC-700 catalyst was evaluated in a full-cell Zn-air battery configuration. The galvanostatic charge-discharge profile of the Fe-Co-NC-700-based cell ( Fig. 7a) showed a high specific capacity of 807 mAh g-1, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst (Fig. 7b). This capacity value is only slightly lower than the theoretical capacity of zinc (824 mAh g-1), indicating that ~98% of the zinc in the negative electrode was utilized during discharge process. Beyond the initial capacity, discharge capacity as a function of cycle number was examined (Fig. 7c). The Fe-Co-NC-700-based cell consistently maintained a higher discharge capacity than the Pt/C-based cell and exhibited excellent durability, retaining ~97% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles. The corresponding charge and discharge potentials are shown in Fig. 7d. For the Fe-Co-NC-700 catalyst, the voltage gap between charge and discharge gradually widened with cycling. This degradation in voltage efficiency could be attributed to several factors such as structural stress under a high current density of 50mAcm-2 and possible dissolution of active Fe and Co species into the alkaline electrolyte, leading to a gradual loss of active sites. Collectively, these results identify 700 °C as an optimal calcination temperature for producing a catalyst that combines high activity with long-term durability. Post-cycling analyses further suggest that the Fe-Co-NC-700 architecture mitigates rapid oxidation of metal active sites and electrolyte-induced carbon corrosion, providing clear design guidelines for durable bifunctional cathodes in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. 4 Conclusion In summary, we successfully developed a series of Fe-Co-NC bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable ZABs using a novel strategy that integrates spray pyrolysis with solvent-free solid-state ZIF conversion. A systematic investigation of pyrolysis temperature revealed that 700 ℃ yields the optimal catalyst (Fe-Co-NC-700) with a high specific surface area well-developed meso- and micro-porosity, and abundant pyridinic-N species. These features contributed to its excellent electrochemical performance, including remarkable activity for both the ORR (E1/2 = 0.82V) and OER, outperforming the catalysts prepared at 800 and 900 °C. Importantly, in practical ZABs half-cell tests, the Fe-Co-NC-700 cathode exhibited a minimal charge-discharge voltage gap and outstanding cycling stability over 150 cycles. Post-cycling analyses revealed that the superior durability of Fe-Co-NC-700 originated from its robust architecture that effectively inhibits the migration and aggregation of active Fe and Co species during cycling test. In contrast, the catalysts synthesized at higher temperatures suffered severe structural degradation, leading to rapid performance loss. These findings highlight the critical role of pyrolysis temperature in tuning catalyst structure, composition and long-term stability. Furthermore, advanced post-reaction analyses, such as in situ XAFS measurements, are necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of stability degradation. The design strategy and degradation insights presented in this study provide a promising guidance for the development of high-performance, non-precious metal catalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries and other electrochemical energy conversion systems.

        "dc:description": "The development of cost-effective and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Fe-Co-NC) through a multi-step strategy involving the spray pyrolysis of a bimetallic oxide precursor, followed by a solvent-free solid-state reaction to form an Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67), and subsequent pyrolysis. A systematic investigation revealed that the pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, and 900 °C) critically influences the structural properties, elemental composition, and electrochemical performance of the catalyst. The catalyst prepared at 700 ℃ (Fe-Co-NC-700) exhibited the most promising results, featuring a high specific surface area (510.8 m2 g-1), abundant pyridinic-N active sites, and uniformly dispersed Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles. Consequently, Fe-Co-NC-700 demonstrated superior bifunctional activity, with a high ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.82V and favorable OER kinetics. When incorporated into a ZAB half-cell, the Fe-Co-NC-700 cathode delivered the smallest charge-discharge voltage gap and exceptional long-term cycling stability for over 150 cycles at 20mAcm-2. In contrast, catalysts pyrolyzed at higher temperatures suffered from the aggregation of the metal active sites, leading to rapid performance degradation. This study highlights a controllable synthesis pathway for fabricating durable, high-performance catalysts for next-generation energy storage devices.",
