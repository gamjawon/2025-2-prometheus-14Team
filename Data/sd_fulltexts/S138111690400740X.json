The asymmetric oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides is realised with layered double hydroxides (LDH)-supported OsO4 catalyst using N-methyl morpholine N-oxide as co-oxidant and (DHQD)2PHAL (hydroquinidine 1,4-phthalazinediyl diether) as a chiral ligand in good yields albeit moderate enantiomeric excess (e.e's). Graphical abstract Asymmetric oxidation of sulfides by LDH supported OsO4 catalyst LDH OsO4-catalyzed asymmetric oxidation of sulfides with N-methyl morpholine N-oxide in the presence of cinchona alkaloids under heterogeneous conditions to sulfoxides in good yields with moderate enantioselectivities is reported. Keywords Osmium Layered double hydroxides Sulfides Chiral sulfoxides Cinchona alkaloids 1 Introduction Chiral sulfoxides have emerged as versatile building blocks in the synthesis of pharmaceutical products and chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis [1–3]. Kagan [4,5] and Furia and Modena [6] independently reported high enantioselectivities using modified versions of sharpless epoxidation system: alkyl hydroperoxide/titanium tetraisopropoxide/diethyl tartrate. Later, catalytic versions of this titanium-mediated reaction and other catalytic systems using salen complexes were also developed [7–10]. Bolm and Bienewald [11a] reported vanadium-chiral Schiff base complex-catalyzed asymmetric sulfur oxidation using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant with good enantioselectivity. Later, Anson and co-workers [11b] and Katsuki and co-workers [11c] further improved the enantioselectivity using more complex Schiff bases. In the recent years, efforts are devoted to the development of processes using a highly robust and recyclable catalyst that provides higher atom utilization and minimized pollution levels using greener ingredients [12]. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTLCs) [13] have recently received much attention in view of their potential usefulness as adsorbents, anion exchangers and most importantly as catalysts [14]. The hydrophilicity of the LDH material makes the hosted oxidation catalyst water compatible to conduct the reactions using water as a solvent. Recently, we have designed and developed a recoverable and reusable osmium catalyst immobilized on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) by the ion-exchange of OsO4 2− for asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins employing NMO as the co-oxidant [15] and effective oxidation of sulfides directly to sulfones using molecular oxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant [16]. Considering that one could expect that a good asymmetric dihydroxylation catalyst can also work for the oxidation of sulfides, and also based on the earlier report of OsO4-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfones in the presence of NMO under homogeneous conditions [17] by Kaldor and Hammond, we opted for the asymmetric oxidation of sulfides by LDH OsO4. We report in this paper heterogeneous osmate-exchanged Mg-Al-LDH catalyst for the asymmetric oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides using NMO (N-methyl morpholine N-oxide) as co-oxidant and (DHQD)2PHAL (hydroquinidine 1,4-phthalazinediyl diether) as a chiral ligand, with good yields albeit moderate e.e's (Scheme 1 ). 2 Experimental K2OsO4·2H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, AlCl3·6H2O, (DHQ)2PHAL, NMO, t BuOH, NaOH, and thioanisole were purchased from Aldrich and used as such without further purification. (DHQD)2PHAL was purchased from Fluka and used as such without further purification. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using the following apparatus: SHIMADZU LC-10AT (liquid chromatograph), SHIMADZU SPD-10A (UV detector), and SHIMADZU C-R6A Chromatopac. ACME silica gel (100–200mesh) was used for column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography was performed on Merck-precoated silica gel 60-F254 plates. Optical rotations were obtained on a Jasco P-1020 polarimeter. Slow addition of the sulfide was carried out using a syringe pump. All the other solvents and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and purified using standard methods. 2.1 Preparation of the catalysts 2.1.1 The preparation of LDH (Mg–Al–Cl) A mixture of MgCl2·6H2O (30.49g, 0.15mmol) and AlCl3·6H2O (12.07g, 0.05mmol) was dissolved in 200ml of deionised water [15]. To this, aqueous solution was then slowly added at 25°C, 100ml of NaOH (2M) solution at pH 10 under a nitrogen flow. The pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at this value by the continuous addition of 2M NaOH. The resulting suspension was stirred overnight under a nitrogen flow at 70°C. The solid product was isolated by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and dried overnight at 80°C. All synthetic steps were carried out using decarbonated water. 2.1.2 The preparation of LDH OsO4 One gram of Mg–Al–Cl LDH was suspended in 100ml of 0.689g (1.87mmol) aqueous potassium osmate solution and stirred at 25°C for 12h under nitrogen atmosphere. The solid catalyst was filtered, washed thoroughly with 300ml of water, and vacuum-dried to obtain 1.416g of LDH OsO4 (1.34mmol of Os per gram). 2.1.3 Typical procedure asymmetric oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide LDH OsO4 (0.03mmol), (DHQD)2PHAL (0.03mmol), and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (3.9mmol) were taken in a round-bottomed flask containing t BuOH-water (1:1, 10ml) and stirred at room temperature. Then sulfide (3mmol) was added slowly for 1h and the reaction mixture was stirred. After completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the catalyst was filtered and washed with methanol. After removing the solvent by rotavapor, the crude material was chromatographed on silica gel to afford the corresponding oxidation product. 3 Results and discussion We first examined the asymmetric oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide by LDH OsO4 with NMO using different ligands(Table 1 ).The e.e is slightly lower with hydroquinine 1,4-phthalazinediyl diether (DHQ)2PHAL when compared to (DHQD)2PHAL. With K2OsO4, under similar conditions, only sulfone was obtained. The reaction at 25°C gave sulfoxide and sulfone in 80/20 ratio and the enantiomeric excess (e.e) is 28% with (DHQD)2PHAL ligand. The reaction proceeded at 0°C with 80% conversion (60/20), and no e.e. We have examined the effect of L/Os (ligand: osmium) on e.e's (Table 2 ) and the higher e.e is obtained using L/Os ratio 5. tert-Butanol/water gave the best results among the solvents examined in the oxidation of sulfides (Table 3 ). The catalyst was reused for three cycles successfully, whereas in the fourth cycle the catalyst shows slightly reduced activity. However, the e.e's of the sulfoxides were reduced in the recycle experiments (Table 4 ). There was no leaching of Os even after the fourth cycle as determined by SEM-EDAX. The asymmetric oxidation of other sulfides is summarized in Table 5 . 4 Conclusions In conclusion, asymmetric oxidation of sulfides has been developed using osmate-exchanged LDHs in the presence of cinchona alkaloids for the first time. The reactions proceeded with good yields, albeit moderate e.e's.
