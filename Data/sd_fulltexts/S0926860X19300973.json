Graphical abstract This study investigates the soot oxidation activity and mechanism of an Al2O3-supported Ag2SO4 catalyst with novel active species. The Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher soot oxidation activity under loose contact conditions compared to Ag/Al2O3 and Ag/CeO2 catalysts. Moreover, it is hardly affected by sulfur poisoning and maintains its high activity after sulfur poisoning treatment. High-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements suggest that a part of Ag2SO4 on the Al2O3 support melts and creates contact between the Ag2SO4 and soot at temperatures over 400 °C, resulting in higher soot oxidation activity even under loose contact conditions. The soot oxidation mechanism over the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst is probed by oxygen isotope exchange analysis and operando X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, which reveal that the oxygen chemically bound in Ag2SO4 is utilized for soot oxidation. In particular, the above oxidation features a reversible redox cycle comprising partial reduction of Ag2SO4 to metallic Ag that is further re-oxidized to Ag2SO4 by the gas-phase oxygen. Abbreviations CDPF catalyzed diesel particulate filter HT-XRD high-temperature X-ray diffraction XAFS X-ray absorption fine structure SEM scanning electron microscopy XRD X-ray diffraction Keywords Diesel exhaust Soot oxidation catalyst Silver sulfate Sulfur poisoning 1 Introduction Diesel and lean burn engines have been attracting attention owing to their high fuel efficiencies and low CO2 emissions. However, the demand for the abatement of nitrogen oxide (NOx; NO + NO2) and particulate matter (mainly “soot”) from diesel engines, which can cause serious environmental and health problems, is high. The catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF) technology is the most effective and widely applied after-treatment soot removal technique. In general, the CDPF contains soot oxidation catalysts that lower the filter regeneration temperature and hence allow for higher fuel economy and smaller thermal stress on CDPF and other catalysts. However, some issues regarding the CDPF, such as the catalytic activity under loose contact conditions, sulfur poisoning, and ash deposition, still remain. The contact between solid soot and solid catalyst is very important for the soot oxidation reaction because oxidation proceeds on their contact points. However, under practical conditions, this contact is poor (loose contact) in the CDPF, and in general, maintaining a sufficient number of contact points is difficult. To overcome this problem, many catalysts and technologies based on different principles have been proposed [1–3]. The application of mobile active species, such as molten salts and eutectic compounds, has been studied to increase the contact between soot and catalysts [4–8]. Catalysts including alkali metals, in particular, K and Cs, are known to maintain tight contact with soot and exhibit high activity even under loose contact conditions. However, a major drawback of such catalysts is deactivation due to the loss of alkali metals from them, in particular, from CDPFs after repeated combustions or aging under water-containing exhaust [9–11]. The use of the mobility of reactive oxygen species has also been reported [12–18]. In particular, reports on Ag/CeO2 system catalysts exhibiting high soot oxidation activity and their oxidation mechanism exist [19–23]. In our previous study, a CeO2-Ag catalyst with a unique rice-ball-type morphology exhibited higher soot oxidation activity than conventional Ag/CeO2 catalysts [24,25]. Moreover, it is less sensitive to the contact mode between the soot and catalyst owing to the fast migration of the active oxygen species. In addition, the active oxygen species can migrate to the soot beyond the ash deposition layer and oxidize the soot even under the no contact condition [26,27]. Another extremely serious problem is degradation caused by sulfur poisoning [28]. Soot oxidation catalysts often suffer from poisoning by sulfur contained in fuel. For example, although the CeO2 system is one of the most effective soot oxidation catalysts, its activity is significantly reduced by sulfur poisoning [29–35]. The deactivation mechanism indicates that effective oxygen sites decrease owing to the adsorption of sulfate anions onto the surface and lattice oxygen sites [29]. Flouty et al. reported that doping Mo into CeO2 catalysts improves their resistance to sulfur poisoning and decreases the sulfate decomposition temperature. However, the doping also decreases their catalytic activities and CO2 formation selectivity [34]. Considering this background, we investigate Ag2SO4 as a novel active species. Ag is one of the most widely studied elements for its high soot oxidation activity [36,37]. Aneggi et al. illustrated clear transmission electron microscopy images of Ag states on CeO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, and the favored states of Ag changed depending on the supports [38]. This study suggests that the Ag metal was the active species. In contrast, Shimizu et al. reported that Ag2O on CeO2 support exhibits excellent soot oxidation activity, although Ag2O itself does not possess catalytic properties [20]. As mentioned above, Ag has the potential to possess soot oxidation activity regardless of the Ag oxidation state, i.e., whether it is a metal or an oxide. Therefore, Ag2SO4 is expected to exhibit high soot oxidation activity when combined with appropriate supports. Gao et al. reported that Ag supported on sulfated Al2O3 forms Ag2SO4 and implied that Ag2SO4 may exhibit catalytic properties [39]. In addition, Ag2SO4 can potentially be used as a mobile active species. Ag2SO4 has a relatively low melting point of ∼650 °C and is expected to melt at lower temperatures when combined with some supports, resulting in the formation of the contact with soot. This study investigates the catalytic performance of Ag2SO4/Al2O3 in loose and tight contact conditions and compares the results with those of Ag/CeO2 and Ag/Al2O3 catalysts. Furthermore, the soot oxidation mechanism over the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst is elucidated using high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), isotope exchange analysis by 18O, and operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that Ag2SO4 on Al2O3 support functions as an excellent active species for soot oxidation based on the obtained results. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO2 and Al2O3 powders were commercially purchased from Solvay (LTT-1, BET surface area: 150 m2/g) and Nikki-Universal (TN-4, BET surface area: 150 m2/g), respectively. Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation of Al2O3 with an aqueous Ag2SO4 solution (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and calcination at 500 °C for 3 h in air. Ag/Al2O3 and Ag/CeO2 were prepared by the physical mixing of a commercial Ag powder (Mitsubishi Materials, Ag-02S) and the supports for 10 min using a mortar. Our previous study has confirmed that the Ag/CeO2 catalysts prepared by the physical mixing method exhibit higher activities than those prepared by the impregnation method [25]. Silver contents were 10 wt%. Fresh catalysts were denoted as Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F), Ag/Al2O3(F), and Ag/CeO2(F). 2.2 Catalyst characterization 2.2.1 X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV XRD system using CuK α radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The data were obtained from 20° to 60° (2θ) with a step size of 0.02° for 0.24 s per step. 2.2.2 High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) HT-XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku RINT-TTR XRD system using CuK α radiation at 50 kV and 300 mA over 2θ of 10°–50° with a step size of 0.02° for 0.6 s per step. The temperature of the samples was raised at 20 °C/min from room temperature to 600 °C in air and maintained for 5 min after every 100 °C increase before performing the measurement. The XRD pattern was also recorded after heating at room temperature. 2.2.3 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM measurements were conducted on JEOL JXA-8500 F. The images were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, and the probe current was 3 nA. All the images were taken as backscattered electron images. 2.2.4 18O2 isotope exchange reaction Isotope exchange reaction experiments were performed in a closed-cycle system (ca. 100 cm3). The gases were analyzed by a quadrupole mass spectrometer system (Q-MASS). Masses of 32, 34, and 36 (O2 isotopomers 16O2, 16O18O, and 18O2, respectively) and 44, 46, and 48 (CO2 isotopomers C16O2, C16O18O, and C18O2, respectively) were continuously monitored. The 18O2 isotope (99.2% of 18O, ICON) exchange was probed by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) using carbon black powder (EVONIK, Printex-V) as a diesel soot model. The catalysts and soot were mixed in a 99:1 wt ratio, and the resulting mixtures were stirred in a magnetically driven mortar for 5 min to achieve a state of tight contact. Subsequently, the mixtures were held under vacuum for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by the introduction of 16% 18O2/N2 gases. The mixtures were heated from 30 to 500 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min in 16% 18O2/N2 in a closed-cycle system. The partial pressure of each gas was calculated by considering constant total pressure. Low-surface-area α-Al2O3 (5 m2/g) was used as a support to reduce the influence of C16O2 and 16O2 adsorbed on the catalyst. 2.2.5 Operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements Operando XAFS measurements were performed at the Toyota Beamline (BL33XU) of SPring-8 [40]. Ag K-edge (25.5 keV) XAFS spectra were measured in transmission mode using ion chamber. Incident X-ray was monochromatized by channel-cut Si(220) monochromator. The analysis sample was prepared by physically mixing the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst and soot in a 19:1 wt ratio. Next, 67 mg of the mixture was pressed into 10-mm-diameter disks, and three disks were stacked and loaded into the heating cell. As a reference, 63 mg of only Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst disks were also prepared. The purpose for stacking three thin disks was to supply oxygen to the inside of the disks. A reaction gas comprising 10% O2, 3% H2O, and He balance was introduced into the disks. Total gas flow rate was 200 mL/min and the reaction temperature was elevated at a rate of 20 °C/min in the range of 50–650 °C. Ag K-edge XAFS spectra were collected at intervals of 10 °C during the reaction and at 50 °C after the reaction. The outlet gases were detected by a Q-mass system (ANELVA type-M-100QA). The mass spectra and XAFS spectra of the mixture during the soot oxidation reaction were simultaneously measured. 2.3 Sulfur poisoning treatment of the catalysts For sulfur poisoning treatment, the catalysts were exposed to a mixture of 120 ppm SO2, 10% O2, 10% CO2, and 10% H2O, with N2 balance at 500 °C. These catalysts were labeled with (S), e.g., Ag/Al2O3(S). In total, 4 g of sulfur was supplied per 60 g of the catalyst, and the supplied amount was twice that required to convert the Ag in the catalyst into Ag2SO4. Moreover, the catalysts were exposed to the same gases at 500 °C without SO2, labeled with (S0). 2.4 Catalytic performance evaluation The catalytic soot oxidation performances of the catalysts were evaluated by the TPO of the soot–catalyst mixture using a Hemmi Slide rule TP5000 fixed-bed reactor. Carbon black powder (EVONIK, Printex-V) was used as a model of diesel soot. To obtain a soot and catalyst mixture in the state of tight contact, both were mixed and stirred by a magnetically driven mortar for 5 min. Further, to obtain a mixture in the state of loose contact, the soot and catalyst were gently mixed by a spatula for 5 min. In particular, 40 mg of this mixture (catalyst:soot = 19:1, w/w) was heated from 30 to 810 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min in 10% O2/He and only He atmosphere. The outlet CO2 concentration was detected by a Q-mass system (ULVAC, RG-102). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst 3.1.1 XRD Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the XRD patterns of Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F), Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S), Ag/Al2O3(F), Ag/Al2O3(S) and Ag/Al2O3(S0) catalysts. The XRD patterns of Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) and Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalysts indicated single-phase of orthorhombic structured Ag2SO4 with Fddd space group except for the diffraction peaks derived from the Al2O3 support, and no evidence of the presence of metallic Ag was obtained. These results show that Ag2SO4 on Al2O3 is stable and does not decompose owing to the catalyst preparation calcination at 500 °C and sulfur poisoning treatment containing 10% H2O. Peaks of Ag metal were observed in the Ag/Al2O3(F) catalyst. For the Ag/Al2O3(S) catalyst, the intensities of Ag metal peaks decreased and new Ag2SO4 peaks appeared. These results indicate that a part of metallic Ag is converted to Ag2SO4 after sulfur poisoning. The XRD pattern of the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst after the treatment without SO2, Ag/Al2O3(S0), was also presented to investigate the effect of heat during sulfur poisoning treatment. The size of the Ag metal crystallite of Ag/Al2O3(S0) calculated by Scherrer’s equation showed an increase of more than 100 nm after heat treatment. Ag2O peaks were not detected in the Ag/Al2O3 and Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalysts before and after sulfur poisoning. The XRD patterns of Ag/CeO2(F) and Ag/CeO2(S) are presented in Fig. 1(b). The intensities of the Ag metal peaks decreased, and the peaks almost disappeared after sulfur poisoning treatment. However, peaks of Ag2SO4 were not detected, unlike the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst. 3.1.2 HT-XRD For the characterization of Ag2SO4 at the reaction temperatures, XRD measurements were conducted at high temperature (100–600 °C) in air. Fig. 2 (a) and 2(b) show the XRD profiles of Ag2SO4 powder and the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst, respectively. The melting point of Ag2SO4 is 652 °C; therefore, the peak intensities of the Ag2SO4 powder do not change at temperatures less than 600 °C, which are below the melting point. As the temperature increased, the diffraction peaks of Ag2SO4 shifted to lower 2θ angles owing to the heat expansion. The crystal structure of Ag2SO4 has been reported to transform from orthorhombic to hexagonal at 430 °C [41], and these diffraction peaks were indexed as Ag2SO4 with P63/mmc space group, which is isomorph of high temperature phases of Na2SO4 and K2SO4 [42,43]. In our study, the above crystal structure transformation was observed over 500 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the Ag2SO4 crystal returned to its orthorhombic structure; however, the ratio of its peak intensities was altered from the original. The transformation is expected to occur with orientation anisotropy [41]. The crystal structure transformation was also observed in the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst over 500 °C. In contrast, the peak intensities of the Ag2SO4 catalyst decreased over 400 °C, and the peaks almost disappeared at 600 °C. The peak intensities of Al2O3 did not change over the entire temperature range. These results indicate that the Ag2SO4 on the Al2O3 support melts below the melting point of Ag2SO4 itself owing to the interaction between Ag2SO4 and Al2O3, i.e., a part of the Ag2SO4 on Al2O3 melts during the soot oxidation reaction. A Tammann temperature of Ag2SO4 (approximately 200 °C) is lower than the temperature at which the peak intensities of Ag2SO4 began to decrease. The Tammann temperature is usually considered as one half the melting point of the solid, at which surface atoms began to migrate and the onset of sintering occurred [44]. It has been reported that mobile active species, such as molten salts and eutectic compounds, increased contact between soot and active species and improved soot oxidation activities [4,5]. In the same fashion, the melting of Ag2SO4 is expected to improve the contact between the soot and Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst and lead to high catalytic activity even under loose contact conditions. The recovering peak intensities of Ag2SO4 were confirmed at room temperature after the high temperature analysis. The peaks of Ag metals were not observed in both the Ag2SO4 powder and catalyst, indicating that the Ag2SO4 on Al2O3 support melted but did not decompose under these conditions. 3.1.3 SEM Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F), and Fig. 3(b) describes the enlarged view of the square part of Fig. 3(a). These are backscattered electron images and the Ag2SO4 particles are indicated in white. Many large Ag2SO4 particles with sizes of several micrometers and some ∼100-nm-sized Ag2SO4 particles were dispersed. The agglomeration of the Ag2SO4 particles occurred during impregnation owing to the low solubility of Ag2SO4 in water, and the number of relatively large particles was considered to increase. 3.2 Catalytic soot oxidation activity of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst Fig. 4 (a) shows the TPO profiles of Ag/CeO2(F) and Ag/CeO2(S) catalysts for soot oxidation under tight contact conditions as well as the profile obtained under catalyst-free conditions. Ag/CeO2(F) exhibited high soot oxidation activity, i.e., allowed soot oxidation at much lower temperatures than those required under catalyst-free conditions. After sulfur poisoning treatment, the temperature required for soot oxidation over the Ag/CeO2(S) catalyst increased, indicating a considerable decrease of catalytic activity. It was reported that the deactivation mechanism was a decrease in the effective oxygen sites due to the adsorption of sulfate anions onto the surface and lattice oxygen sites of CeO2 [29]. Furthermore, under the sulfur poisoning and catalyst-free conditions, the amount of CO2 produced significantly decreased whereas all the soot could be completely oxidized even under catalyst-free conditions, indicating the incomplete oxidation of soot to afford CO. Similarly, Weng et al. reported that the CO2 formation selectivity of CeO2-based soot oxidation catalysts decreases after sulfur poisoning [30,31]. Fig. 4(b) shows the TPO profiles of Ag/Al2O3 and Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalysts in the state of tight contact. The moderate activity of the Ag/Al2O3(F) catalyst improved after sulfur treatment. In general, soot oxidation activity decreases after sulfur poisoning treatment; therefore, this result is very interesting and attracts research attention. The Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst exhibited higher soot oxidation activity than the Ag/Al2O3(F) catalyst and its activity was as high as that of the Ag/Al2O3(S) catalyst. Further, the Ag/Al2O3(S0) catalyst was evaluated to clarify the thermal influence during the sulfur poisoning treatment. The improvement in the activity was not confirmed by the SO2 free heat treatment; therefore, the activation of the Ag/Al2O3(S) catalyst was considered attributable to SO2 gas. Moreover, the peak at the low temperature was considered attributed to the silver oxide produced by the oxidization of the Ag surface during heat treatment. Silver oxide reacts with soot at low temperature but it is not catalytically, but stoichiometrically [20]. Based on the XRD and TPO results, the main factor influencing the improvement of soot oxidation activity is not the activation of metallic Ag but the formation of Ag2SO4. It can be verified that Ag2SO4 adequately functions as the active species of a soot oxidation catalyst. In addition, the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalyst showed a CO2 peak similar to that of fresh Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst, indicating that the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was hardly affected by sulfur. Fig. 5 (a) shows the TPO profiles of fresh catalysts in the state of loose contact, and Fig. 5(b) describes their TPO profiles after sulfur poisoning treatment. The CO2 formation over the Ag/CeO2(F) catalyst was observed at a low temperature; however, the oxidation rate was low and the peak was broad. This result indicates that the contact between the soot and catalyst decreases under loose contact conditions. On the contrary, the peaks of Ag/Al2O3(F) and Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalysts were comparatively sharp and their oxidation rates were high. Aneggi et al. also reported that the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited higher activity than the Ag/CeO2 catalyst under loose contact conditions [38]. Notably, the peak temperature of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst was lower than that of the Ag/CeO2(F) catalyst under the loose contact conditions. The Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst was assumed to maintain the contact owing to melting under loose contact conditions even though the fresh Ag2SO4 particles were agglomerated and the dispersibility was low (Fig. 3). After sulfur poisoning treatment, the activity of the Ag/CeO2(S) catalyst further decreased to as low as that when no catalyst is present. In contrast, although the activity of Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) decreased slightly, it was still superior to that of Ag/CeO2(S) and that with no catalyst. These results show both the high activity and high resistance of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst to sulfur poisoning treatment even under practical conditions. Fig. 6 (a) shows the temperature (T50) at which 50% of the soot is converted in the state of tight contact. The lower the value of T50, the higher is the soot oxidation activity. The lowest T50 was obtained with the Ag/CeO2(F) catalyst; however, the activity remarkably decreased after sulfur poisoning treatment and the oxidation temperature increased by about 160 °C. In contrast, the T50 of the Ag/Al2O3(S) catalyst decreased by about 40 °C after sulfur poisoning treatment, and the value was close to that of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalyst. Even after sulfur poisoning treatment, the activity of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalyst did not decrease. This result indicates that the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was hardly affected by sulfur poisoning treatment. The Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalyst showed a T50 value of ∼90 °C lower than that of the Ag/CeO2(S) catalyst and could maintain higher activity compared with the CeO2-based catalyst system. Fig. 6(b) shows the T50 of soot oxidation in the state of loose contact. Here, the T50 of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst was about 20 °C lower than that of the Ag/CeO2(F) catalyst and was the lowest among the three catalysts. It is understood that the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst maintains the contact between the catalyst and soot because the increase in T50 is low compared with that under tight contact conditions. Moreover, the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(S) catalyst exhibited high activity and its T50 was 70 °C lower than that of the Ag/CeO2(S) catalyst. After sulfur poisoning treatment, the T50 of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was 80 °C lower than that when no catalyst was used; however, the activity of Ag/CeO2(S) decreased to that under catalyst-free conditions. As mentioned above, it was shown that the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst has high resistance to sulfur poisoning treatment. On the other hand, the molten salt catalysts often have problems in terms of hydrothermal resistance [9–11]. The aqueous solubility of sulfates of alkali metals such as K and Cs is high. This could decrease their activity under hydrothermal conditions. By contrast, the relatively low aqueous solubility of Ag2SO4 (0.8 g/100 cm3) predicts high durability against hydrothermal treatments. As future work, the activity and durability of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst will be confirmed in a practical CDPF system. 3.3 Reaction analysis of the soot oxidation mechanism over Ag2SO4/Al2O3 3.3.1 TPO under He atmosphere Although the soot oxidation activity of the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was confirmed, its mechanism remains unknown. To clarify the soot oxidation mechanism, the soot oxidation activities of Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) and Ag/Al2O3(F) were examined by TPO under He atmosphere and without O2 (Fig. 7 ). No generation of CO2 over the Ag/Al2O3(F) catalyst was detected. In contrast, CO2 formation due to the oxidation of soot over the Ag2SO4/Al2O3(F) catalyst was observed. Furthermore, the oxidation started at a temperature similar to condition of 10% O2/He. These results imply that the oxygen atom in the sulfate anion may be used for soot oxidation under He atmosphere. The amount of oxygen used to produce CO2 was about half of that in the sulfate anion of the catalyst. As examples using oxygen of sulfate effectively, Machida et al. reported that lanthanide oxysulfate has oxygen storage capacity and can repeatedly release and store the oxygen in the oxysulfate [45,46]. 3.3.2 18O isotope exchange reaction The soot oxidation mechanism over Ag2SO4/Al2O3 was clarified by TPO in 18O2 atmosphere performed in a closed-cycle system (i.e., the gas-phase oxygen contained 18O and the catalyst contained 16O). The generation of CO2 containing 16O implied that soot oxidation involved the oxygen atoms of Ag2SO4. In this experiment, the C16O2 (m/z = 44) molecules were strongly adsorbed on the soot–catalyst and could not be completely removed by vacuum pretreatment. Because the C16O2 molecules from adsorption and reaction could not be distinguished, they are not discussed herein. Low-surface-area α-Al2O3 (5 m2/g) was used as a support to reduce the influence of C16O2 and 16O2 adsorbed on the catalyst. Moreover, no thermal pretreatment was performed because the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst could react with soot even in an inert atmosphere (Fig. 7). Fig. 8 shows the partial pressures of gases as functions of the catalyst bed temperature, demonstrating that the exchange reactions between the 18O2 and 16O atoms of the catalyst (18O2 + Ag2S16O4 → 16O18O + Ag2S16O3 18O) and those between 18O2 and CO2 (18O2 + C16O2 → 16O18O + C16O18O) could be neglected because almost no 16O2 and 16O18O formation was detected during the reaction. As the catalyst bed temperature increased, the formation of 16O-containing C16O18O (m/z = 46) was observed starting from 300 °C, which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, significant amounts of C18O2 (m/z = 48) were generated at higher reaction temperatures. Therefore, the oxygen atoms of Ag2SO4 were preferentially used for soot oxidation, and the calculations based on the amount of C16O18O formed indicated that only 10% of this oxygen, perhaps surface oxygen of the Ag2SO4, was utilized at the below 500 °C. 3.3.3 Operando XAFS measurement To gain further mechanistic insights, the CO2 and SO2 concentrations in the outlet gas were measured by mass spectrometry (Fig. 9 (a)), and the chemical states of Ag in the catalyst were probed by operando XAFS measurements (Fig. 9(b)). In addition, in order to investigate the influence of water on the soot oxidation over the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst, the above measurements were examined under the condition containing 3% H2O. Note that CO2 formation was observed at temperatures above 400 °C, and no SO2 was detected, indicating that Ag2SO4 did not decompose during soot oxidation. Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst showed the similar activity as the condition without water in TPO evaluation (Fig. 4(b)), indicating that the water had little impact on the catalytic activity. Fig. 9(b) shows the relative contents of Ag species in the catalyst during soot oxidation for a model system containing Ag, Ag2O, Ag2S, and Ag2SO4 and demonstrates the negligible amounts of Ag2O and Ag2S. Ag2SO4 was partially converted into metallic Ag at temperatures above 400 °C and reconverted into Ag2SO4 at temperatures above 500 °C; this was accompanied by soot consumption (Fig. 9(a)). The relative content of Ag2SO4 after the reaction (>96%) was almost equal to the relative content of that before the reaction, indicating catalytic soot oxidation with respect to Ag2SO4. In soot-rich catalyst–soot mixtures below 500 °C in Fig. 9(b), Ag2SO4 reduction was observed by operando XAFS measurements, indicating that under these conditions, Ag2SO4 reduction was faster than Ag re-oxidation by gas-phase O2. In contrast, in catalyst–soot mixtures with lower soot contents above 500 °C in Fig. 9(b), the above oxidation was faster than the reduction, and the reduced Ag was promptly re-oxidized to form Ag2SO4. 3.4 Possible mechanism of soot oxidation Based on the above results, this study proposes a soot oxidation mechanism featuring reversible redox processes, as shown in Fig. 10 . First, at elevated temperatures, the Ag2SO4 on Al2O3 melted below the melting point of Ag2SO4 itself, indicating that the contact between the soot and Ag2SO4 active species increased and the soot oxidation reaction easily occurred even under loose contact conditions. Then, initially, the oxygen atoms of Ag-bonded SO4 moieties were used for soot oxidation accompanied by CO2 formation. At the same time, the Ag cations were reduced to metallic Ag, perhaps by accepting electrons from oxygen atoms in sulfate anions. Next, the metallic Ag was subsequently re-oxidized by gas-phase O2 to regenerate Ag2SO4. Thus, the suggested reversible cycle accounted for the gradual exchange of the oxygen atoms in Ag2SO4 for gas-phase oxygen atoms. 4 Conclusions This study proposes Ag2SO4/Al2O3 as a catalyst with higher soot oxidation activity under loose as well as tight contact conditions compared to Ag/Al2O3 and Ag/CeO2 catalysts. Although a Ag/CeO2 catalyst that exhibits high activity under fresh condition was deactivated by sulfur poisoning, the proposed Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst was hardly affected and maintained its high activity even after sulfur poisoning treatment. HT-XRD measurements showed that Ag2SO4 on the Al2O3 support melted at a temperature below the melting point of Ag2SO4 itself owing to the interaction between Ag2SO4 and Al2O3. This suggests that, at least, a part of the melted Ag2SO4 on the Al2O3 support contacts soot at temperatures over 400 °C, resulting in the high soot oxidation activity even under loose contact conditions. The results of TPO evaluations under He atmosphere, 18O2 isotopic reaction analyses, and operando XAFS measurements showed that the oxygen species in the SO4 2− anion were preferentially used for soot oxidation and a part of Ag+ cations were reduced to metallic Ag. Then, the metallic Ag was re-oxidized by gas-phase O2 to regenerate Ag2SO4. This study proposes a soot oxidation mechanism featuring the reversible redox processes of catalytic Ag. Based on this mechanism, we revealed for the first time that the Ag2SO4 in the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst functions well as an active species for soot oxidation.

        "dc:description": "This study investigates the soot oxidation activity and mechanism of an Al2O3-supported Ag2SO4 catalyst with novel active species. The Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits higher soot oxidation activity under loose contact conditions compared to Ag/Al2O3 and Ag/CeO2 catalysts. Moreover, it is hardly affected by sulfur poisoning and maintains its high activity after sulfur poisoning treatment. High-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements suggest that a part of Ag2SO4 on the Al2O3 support melts and creates contact between the Ag2SO4 and soot at temperatures over 400 °C, resulting in higher soot oxidation activity even under loose contact conditions. The soot oxidation mechanism over the Ag2SO4/Al2O3 catalyst is probed by oxygen isotope exchange analysis and operando X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, which reveal that the oxygen chemically bound in Ag2SO4 is utilized for soot oxidation. In particular, the above oxidation features a reversible redox cycle comprising partial reduction of Ag2SO4 to metallic Ag that is further re-oxidized to Ag2SO4 by the gas-phase oxygen.",
