Multiple-SO3H functionalized ionic liquid as efficient catalyst for direct conversion of carbohydrate biomass into levulinic acid Shengbin Shi Yuanfeng Wu Mengting Zhang Ruiping Wei Lijing Gao Guomin Xiao ⁎ School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 211189, China School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Southeast University Nanjing Jiangsu Province 211189 China School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 211189, China ⁎ Corresponding author. A series of new SO3H-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) were synthesized and characterized, which were successfully applied to catalyze cellulose to produce levulinic acid (LA) via one-pot reaction. The structure, thermal property, and acidity of ILs were characterized by NMR, TGA, and Hammett acidity measurement. The Hammett acidity (H0) of ILs increase in the following order: [BSim]H2PO4 <[BSim]TsO < [BSim]CF3SO3 < [BSim]HSO4, which is consistent with their yield of LA order using these ILs as catalysts. Under the optimum conditions, the yield reached up to 65% when [BSim]HSO4 was used as catalyst and solvent, which is one of the best results compared to those reported in literature. Moreover, the ILs were easily recycled without structural change even after four cycles, and the yield of LA was up to 44% at the fifth cycle. Furthermore, TGA indicated that these SO3H-functionalized ILs exhibited excellent thermal stability. These efficient ILs will provide new options for converting biomass resources to LA and other chemicals. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Keywords Biomass Levulinic acid SO3H-functionalized ionic liquids One-pot reaction 1 Introduction With the increasing depletion of fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, the world is facing a severe energy crisis. As a kind of clean and renewable energy, biomass resource has the advantages of low cost, variety and the ability to realize carbon cycle [1, 2]. Recently, many researchers have carried out research on the production of energy and chemicals from biomass resources [3]. As one of the 12 platform compounds, levulinic acid can be prepared from biomass resources such as cellulose, glucose, sucrose and chitin. The structure of LA possessed carboxylic and ketone groups, which can undergo many kinds of reactions like redox, esterification, and polymerization [4-6], and is now widely used as multifunctional building blocks for the synthesis of solvents, fuel additives, pesticides, resins, coatings, dyes, rubber, pharmaceutical products and other industries [7-10]. Thus, the synthesis of LA from biomass resource has attracted the attention of many researchers. Cellulose is one of the most abundant biomass materials in nature, and it is difficult to degrade due to dense packing structure and insolubility in conventional solvents [11, 12]. In most cases, the hydrolysis of cellulose uses inorganic acids [13], such as HCl and H2SO4 [14-16], solid acid catalyst [17-20], and metal chlorides [21, 22]. Previous studies have found that reactions using these catalysts have some insurmountable problems. For example, metal chlorides and inorganic acid have problems of catalyst recovery, stability, and environmental pollution, while solid acids have low catalytic activity. Zuo et al. used CP-SO3 H-x as catalyst in the hydrolysis of cellulose to produce LA with a high yield of 66.5% [17]. Alonso et al. reported that the yield of LA reached up to 69% when cellulose was catalyzed by Amberlyst 70 in the presence of gamma-valerolactone and water mixture solvent [18]. Joshi et al. reported that the yield of LA was 53.9% if solid catalyst ZrO2 was used to convert cellulose [23]. Ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as a green catalyst and solvent owing to their low vapor pressure, high thermal stability, easy recovery and environmentally friendly [24, 25]. ILs with various anions and cations can be designed and synthesized for various tasks [26]. Therefore, using pure ILs as solvent and catalyst to convert biomass resources into LA is a very significant approach [27-32]. Among ILs, acidic ILs have become an efficient catalyst for producing LA from biomass resource. Some studies have involved the production of LA from biomass over acidic ILs [7, 29, 33]. Ramli and coworkers used [SMIM][FeCl4] as the catalyst to convert glucose into LA with a yield of 67.8% [34]. Ren and coworkers reported that a high yield of 66.2% was achieved using cellulose and [C3SO3Hmim]Cl as reactant and catalyst, respectively [33]. Fu and coworkers investigated the catalytic decomposition of cellulose to produce LA using [PrSMim]Cl as the catalyst, and found that the yield of LA was up to 65% [29]. However, most of the reported ILs were commercialized available ILs and demonstrated poor performance when employed to convert biomass into LA [7], and the main factor such as anions determining the catalytic activity and acidity of ionic liquids is still unclear. Herein, a series of new SO3H-functionalized ILs, containing 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-(4-sulfonicacid)butyl)butane (BSim+) cation with counter anions namely hydrogen sulfate (HSO4 −), trifluoromethanesulfonate (CF3SO3 −), toluenesulfonate (TsO−), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4 −) were synthesized and characterized, respectively, which were used as catalyst for converting cellulose into LA. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, IL loading, and H2O dosages on the yield of LA was studied and discussed using [BSim]HSO4 as catalyst. This research provides new insights for converting biomass into LA using SO3H-functionalized ILs as catalyst. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and equipment Chemicals reagents used in this work include imidazole (Admas, AR), 1,4-dichlorobutane (Admas, AR), 1,4-butane sulfonate (Admas, AR), NaOH (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), dimethyl sulfoxide (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), diethyl ether (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), toluene (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (Admas, AR), phosphoric acid (Sinopharm Chemical, 85%), sulphuric acid (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), p-toluenesulfonic acid (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), sucrose (Sinopharm Chemical, AR), d-cellobiose (Sinopharm Chemical, BR), starch (AR, Macklin Biochemical), microcrystalline cellulose(AR, Sigma-Aldrich), Chitosan (degree of deacetylation value of 95%, Energy Chemical), and Chitin (practical grade, Aladdin).

Hammett acidity (H0) of ILs was measured using UV–vis spectrum with an indicator of 4-nitroaniline. The concentration of 4-nitroaniline and ILs solution were 0.1 mmol L − 1 and 25 mmol L − 1, respectively, which were prepared using solvent H2O. The H0 acidity of IL was calculated using the following equation [37]: (1) H 0 = p k a [ I ] + l o g ( [ I ] / [ I H + ] ) Where H0 is Hammett acidity, the 4-nitroaniline has a pKa [I] value of 0.99, [I] and [IH+] are the concentration of un-protonated form of 4-nitroaniline and protonated form of 4-nitroaniline, respectively. 2.4 Conversion of cellulose to LA and LA separation In a typical procedure for the preparation of LA from cellulose, [BSim]HSO4 (1.0 g), cellulose (100 mg), and water (0.80 g) were added into a 4 mL thick-walled pressure bottle, and the reaction mixture was heated at 180 ℃ and vigorously stirred for 3 h, the reaction was stopped by cooling the reactor in water. A 100 µL of reaction solution was taken and diluted with 500 µL of deuterated water, which was then centrifuged to filter out solid residue. During the reaction process, all the reactants and product were stayed in the reaction system, as a result there is no mass loss at the reaction process. The diluted solution of reaction was analyzed by 1H NMR with the catalyst IL as the internal standards. H2 and Hb/c were used for the integration of LA and IL (Fig. S1), respectively [31], using quantitative NMR spectroscopy. Besides, the mole of LA was calculated using the following Eq. (2) [38]: (2) N anl = N std ( I anl / I std ) ( p std / p anl ) P std Where anl is the analyte of LA, std is the standard reference material of [BSim]HSO4, and N is the number of moles; I is the integration peak area; p is the number of nuclei of peak measured; and Pstd is the purity (100%). The IL is stability at the reaction condition, and has high boiling point, hence the LA is remained in the diluted solution of reaction. Therefore, it is reliable to calculate the yield of LA using IL as the internal standards. 1H NMR spectra were collected for 64 scans. HOD (4.79 ppm) was used as a reference for NMR spectra. The yield of LA was calculated using the following Eq. (3), and the LA yield was 65%. (3) Y LA ( mol % ) = ( mol of LA ) / ( mol of C 6 unit in cellulose ) × 100 % Water (15 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and then centrifuged to separate the solid residues. It was extracted by methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) (20 mL ×3), and the combined MIBK solution was concentrated to afford the pure LA (see Fig. S1c). The experimental error was evaluated to be within 3% according to the standard samples of known molar weight. Finally, solid residues were washed with ethanol and water, and then dried in an oven. 2.5 IL recycling At the first run, cellulose (100 mg), [BSim]HSO4 (1.00 g), and water (0.60 g) were added into a 4 mL thick-walled pressure bottle at 180 ℃ and vigorously stirred for 5 h. The reaction was stopped by cooling the reactor in water. A 100 µL of reaction solution was taken and diluted with 500 µL of deuterated water, which was then` centrifuged to filter out solid residue. Then the diluted solution was analyzed by 1H NMR with the IL as internal standard, and the obtained LA was 38.24 mg with a yield of 65%. Water (15 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and then centrifuged to separate the solid residues such as insoluble humin. Thereafter, the diluted reaction solution was also extracted with MIBK (20 mL×3), butyl acetate (20 mL×3) and n‑butyl alcohol (20 mL×3) to separate the products and soluble humin, respectively. After extraction, the remaining compounds in the solution were IL [BSim]HSO4, which were evaporated using a rotary system under vacuum to obtain 0.91 g [BSim]HSO4. The [BSim]HSO4 was finally dried at 120 ℃ for 8 h, which was then reused in the next cycle without further purification. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of ILs The ILs were characterized by NMR spectra, HRMS spectra and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). NMR spectra of ILs were obtained on the Bruker Ascend (400, 500, or 600 MHz) NMR spectrometer using D2O as solvent and HOD as internal standard solvent. FT-IR and HRMS data were collected from Nicolet 5700 spectrometer and Agilent 1260–6224, respectively. The spectra of ILs are provided in the Supporting Information (Fig. S2–16). 3.2 Hammett acidity of ILs The UV–vis spectroscopy was used to measure the acidity of SO3H-functionalized ILs. The values of H0 measured for ILs are shown in Fig. 1 a and summarized in Table 1 . The absorption of 4-nitroaniline indicator significantly decreased after the addition of ILs. The related values of H0 for [BSim]HSO4, [BSim]CF3SO3, [BSim]TsO, and [BSim]H2PO4 were 1.24, 1.26, 1.43, and 2.04, respectively. The result indicated that the acidity of the ILs increased in the order: [BSim]H2PO4 < [BSim]TsO < [BSim]CF3SO3 < [BSim]HSO4. Consequently, the yield of LA increased with the simultaneous increase of acidity, indicating the crucial factor of the acidity in the catalytic cellulose conversion to LA, which was likely due to the protonation of glycosidic oxygen [33]. 3.3 Thermal stability of ILs In generally, protic ILs demonstrated weaker thermal stability than aprotic ILs. In this research, these ILs were dicationic protic ILs, hence the research of their thermal behavior is very meaningful. The TGA curve of ILs is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The result suggested that these ILs had different thermal degradation profile and were thermally stable above 200 ℃. Among these ILs, the [BSim]H2PO4 showed the highest thermal stability above 300 ℃. For ILs [BSim]HSO4, [BSim]CF3SO3, and [BSim]TsO, only a slight decrease in weight loss resulting from water molecule could be observed around 100 ℃. The order of ILs in terms of thermal stability is: [BSim]H2PO4>[BSim]TsO>[BSim]HSO4>[BSim]CF3SO3. 3.4 Decomposition of carbohydrates to LA using ILs 3.4.1 Effect of temperature and IL dosages on the LA yield The ILs were used as catalyst in the production of LA from cellulose. Generally, the conversion of cellulose to LA was mainly divided into four steps according to the literature [7]. As showed in Scheme 2, cellulose was depolymerized into glucose under acidic conditions, and then the glucose was isomerized to fructose. Afterwards, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was obtained by dehydration of fructose under the IL effect. Lastly, HMF was dehydrated to produce LA and formic acid under acidic conditions. Since [BSim]HSO4 had the highest H0 among these ILs, so [BSim]HSO4 was used as a catalyst to optimize the reaction temperature and IL dosages. The effect of reaction temperature was studied in the range of 160 ℃ to 200 ℃. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the yield of LA increased from 14% to 53% when the reaction temperature increased from 160 ℃ to 180 ℃. However, when the reaction temperature increased to be more than 180 ℃, the yield of LA gradually decreased from 53% at 180 ℃ to 34% at 200 ℃. The increased temperature promoted the side reaction. Therefore, this reaction was sensitive to the reaction temperature, and the reaction temperature of 180 ℃ was selected as optimum temperature in order to obtain a high yield of LA. IL is essential to catalyze cellulose conversion to LA. The amount of IL was increased from 0.25 g to 1.25 g (Fig. 2b) while keeping other factors unchanged (100 mg cellulose, 1.0 g [BSim]HSO4, 0.6 g H2O, 180 ℃, and 5 h). With the increase of the amount of IL, the yield of LA gradually increased, reaching up to 53% in the presence of 1.0 g of IL. The increase in the yield of LA with the increase of IL dosage was attributed to the sufficient dispersion and diffusion of IL in the cellulose structure and the increase in the number of active sites [39]. However, the yield of LA was plateaued out with the amount of IL beyond 1.0 g. Hence, the optimal dosage of IL was 1.0 g. 3.4.2 Screening of ILs For the sake of discovering the efficient ILs used as catalyst for converting cellulose into LA, ILs containing various anions (HSO4 −, TsO−, CF3SO3 −, and H2PO4 −) were used in the reaction at the optimal reaction temperature and IL dosage. The result in Fig. 2c and Table S1 showed that all these ILs could directly convert cellulose into LA. The IL containing anion HSO4 − had better performance with a higher yield of LA under the same reaction condition (100 mg cellulose, 1.0 g IL, 0.6 g H2O, 180 ℃). The highest yield of 57% was obtained using [BSim]HSO4 as catalyst at 180 ℃ for 3 h, which was likely due to its higher acidity in the anion HSO4 −. The anion HSO4 − could easily destroy the hydrogen bonding of cellulose, hence facilitating the conversion of cellulose to LA [40]. In case of [BSim]CF3SO3 and [BSim]TsO, the yield of LA was 56% and 55% at 40 min, respectively. It should be noted that [BSim]CF3SO3 and [BSim]TsO had similar anions CF3SO3 − and p-CH3C6H4SO3 −, respectively, which exhibited similar performance in the production of LA from cellulose. For the anion H2PO4 − containing [BSim]H2PO4, the catalytic performance was very poor with a yield of 25% at 4 h, which was likely due to the low acidity of [BSim]H2PO4. The yield of LA followed in the order: [BSim]HSO4 > [BSim]CF3SO3 >[BSim]TsO >[BSim]H2PO4, which is in good agreement with their H0 acidity. The stronger acidity of IL, and the high LA yield were obtained underlining the essential role of the acidity in the catalytic cleavage of cellulose. It can be concluded that the acidity of ILs has a great influence on the conversion system. Hence the [BSim]HSO4 was used as the catalyst for optimizing the reaction condition due to its highest catalytic activity derived from strongest H0 among these ILs. 3.4.3 Effect of water amount Water is an important parameter on the conversion system. Since IL is expensive, adding water that reduces their purity can offset the amount of IL used. Water also lowers the viscosity of ILs and increases the solubility of cellulose within a certain concentration. Fig. 2d shows that water amount had a great influence on the yield of LA under the optimal conditions of reaction temperature and IL dosage. At reaction time of 2 h, when the amount of water increased from 0.4 g to 0.8 g, the yield of LA increased from 53% to 65%. As the amount of water increased on the conversion system, dilution effect suppresed the formation of humin byproducts, leading to a higher yield of LA. However, as the amount of water further increased from 0.8 g to be 1.2 g, the yield of LA decreased significantly from 65% to 59%, due to the production rate of LA gradually declined under the influence of dilution effect, suggesting that excessive water played a negative role in this reaction. Further increasing reaction time to 3 h, the LA yield was decreased from 53% to 47% at the condition of 0.4 g water, implying that excessive IL concentration is detrimental to LA synthesis from cellulose and aggravates the formation of humins. At the reaction time of 3 h, as the amount of water increased from 0.4 g to 0.8 g, all of LA yield increased from 47% to 65%. Then the LA yield was gradually decreased from 65% to 61% with increase water amount. Thus, 0.8 g water was used in the reaction system. The composition of reaction products was analyzed by 1H NMR and GC–MS, and the relevant result was showed in Table S2. The main products were LA, HCOOH, humin, and traces of intermediate product such as glucose and 5-HMF, demonstrating high selectivity of the reaction system. 3.4.4 Comparison of ILs with literature report Table 2 summarizes the representative result of conversion cellulose to LA using ILs as catalyst. The results showed that the catalyst [BSim]HSO4 was one of the most efficient IL catalysts for producing LA from cellulose. Most literature report that ILs possessed only one sulfonic group in cation and one anion, which has low H0 acidity. The [BSim]HSO4 has two sulfonic group in cation and two bisulfate ion. Hence, the most literature report that ILs are not efficient to convert cellulose into LA compared with the [BSim]HSO4. The high efficiency of [BSim]HSO4 might be attributed to their high H0, which played an important role in destroying inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bond, hence promoting the conversion of cellulose to LA. 3.4.5 Conversion of various biomass into LA The reaction of [BSim]HSO4 catalyzing other biomass (sucrose, cellobiose, starch, chitin, and chitosan) conversion to produce LA was performed in one-pot reaction under the optimal reaction conditions of cellulose. As shown in Fig. 3 a, [BSim]HSO4 catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity for the catalytic conversion of disaccharides (sucrose and cellobiose). Without adding other catalysts, the yields of LA from sucrose and cellobiose were 58% and 56%, respectively. A decent 51% yield of LA was obtained when starch was used as the substrates. Moreover, it should be noted that [BSim]HSO4 catalyst was also sufficient for catalyzing the conversion of nitrogen-contain biomass (chitin and chitosan), and the yield of LA was up to 52% and 46% using chitin and chitosan as substrates, respectively. The above result indicated that [BSim]HSO4 catalyst has great potential for further application in catalyzing the conversion of biomass into high-value LA platform compounds. 3.4.6 Recycling of the IL IL is characteristic of its recyclability compared to traditional inorganic acid catalyst. After reaction, a certain amount of water was added to the reaction mixture in order to dilute the reaction solution, and then centrifuged to separate the solid residues. MIBK, butyl acetate and n‑butyl alcohol were used to extract the LA product from the reaction solution, respectively, where the extraction efficiency of over 95% and over 90% of IL was recovered. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, continuous cycles showed a slight decrease in the yield of LA from 53% to 52%, 50%, 47% and 44%, indicating that the IL possessed good catalytic activity. The fresh and reused IL showed almost identical 1H NMR spectra in Fig. S17, demonstrating that the catalyst [BSim]HSO4 contained no impurities and was stable during the reaction condition. The H0 of [BSim]HSO4 and [BSim]H2PO4 after five reaction cycles was also measured, and the relevant data was plotted in Table S3. The H0 of [BSim]HSO4 and [BSim]H2PO4 after five reaction cycles was 1.37 and 2.24, which obviously decreased compared with the fresh ILs, and the LA yield also decreased after cycles for catalyst [BSim]H2PO4. It was inferred that humins and other byproducts causing decrease in the acidity of IL [43], which led to the LA yield gradually decreased. More importantly, LA was obtained as pure product by distilling the combined MIBK solution (Fig. S1c). 3.5 Characterization of solid residues At the reaction course of the cellulose of conversion to LA, it was found that about 12 wt% of solid residue calculated relative to cellulose reactant and 65% yield of LA were produced under the optimized conditions (100 mg cellulose, 1.0 g [BSim]HSO4, 0.8 g H2O, 180 ℃, 3 h), whereas solid residues were characterized by means of TGA, FT-IR, and SEM. The weight loss of cellulose and solid residues is shown in Fig. 4 a. The main decomposition temperature of cellulose was located at the range of 290 ℃ to 360 ℃. After reaction, the decomposition peak of cellulose disappeared in the temperature range of 290 ℃ to 360 ℃, and a typical humin peak appeared in the temperature range of 430 ℃ to 500 ℃ [44], indicating that the solid residue was humin after reaction. Cellulose and solid residues were also characterized by FT-IR spectra (Fig. 4b and S18). The characteristic band of cellulose was located at 2898 cm−1, 1430 cm−1, 1165 cm−1, 1110 cm−1, 1058 cm−1, and 894 cm−1 [45]. After reaction, the cellulose bands disappeared, meanwhile, four new bands appeared at 1710 cm−1, 1614 cm−1, 1034 cm−1, and 796 cm−1. Two bands at 1710 cm−1 and 1614 cm−1 were assigned to C = O and C = C stretching vibrations, respectively, and the other two bands located at 1034 cm−1 and 796 cm−1 were assigned to CO vibrations and CH out of plane bending vibrations, respectively. These four bands were characteristic of humin, suggesting that the humin byproduct was produced after the conversion of cellulose to LA. In order to fully reveal the difference of cellulose and solid residues, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, FEI Inspect F50, USA) analysis was performed for cellulose and solid residues after reaction (Fig. 4c-4h). Fig. 4f shows a distinctly massive structure of cellulose with diameter ranging between 6 and 12 um in the lower magnification, and the cellulose shows smooth surface with fiber at the higher magnification in Fig. 4c. After reaction for 2 h, the massive structure of cellulose appear cracked in Fig. 4g, suggested that the cellulose is disrupted and depolymerisation starts to take place, leaving small agglomerate particle less than 0.5 um in Fig. 4d. After reaction for 3 h, the particle size was reduced in Fig. 4h, and more agglomerate particles were formed, leaving the agglomerate particle with diameter less than 0.3 um in Fig. 4e. These changes could be assigned to [BSim]HSO4, which effectively destroyed the hydrogen bond in the cellulose during the ILs treatment, suggesting that the cellulose was fully converted to other compounds, hence the solid residue was humin byproduct under the reaction conditions. 4 Conclusions In this work, a series of SO3H-functionalized ILs were synthesized and successfully applied as the catalysts for converting cellulose into LA. The structure, stability, and H0 of ILs were characterized, and all of these ILs showed high thermal stability. The H0 of ILs was almost determined by the anions, and followed the order H2PO4 −< TsO− < CF3SO3 − < HSO4 −. Meanwhile, the H0 had an obvious influence on the yield of LA, and the yield of LA using [BSim]HSO4, [BSim]CF3SO3, [BSim]TsO, [BSim]H2PO4 as catalyst were 65%, 56%, 55%, and 25%, respectively, which is in good agreement with their H0 order. It should be noted that [BSim]HSO4 showed higher performance for the production of LA from cellulose at 180 ℃ for 3 h, which is one of the best yields compared to those reported in literature. Moreover, [BSim]HSO4 catalyst also showed great performance for converting other biomass such as sucrose, chitin, and cellobiose to LA. The [BSim]HSO4 was recycled up to five times with a 44% yield of LA, and the 1H NMR spectra showed that the recycle IL was high purity after recycling for four times. Thus, these SO3H-functionalized ILs provide a new approach for the conversion of biomass into LA.

The structure, thermal property, and acidity of ILs were characterized by NMR, TGA, and Hammett acidity measurement. The Hammett acidity (H0) of ILs increase in the following order: [BSim]H2PO4 <[BSim]TsO < [BSim]CF3SO3 < [BSim]HSO4, which is consistent with their yield of LA order using these ILs as catalysts. Under the optimum conditions, the yield reached up to 65% when [BSim]HSO4 was used as catalyst and solvent, which is one of the best results compared to those reported in literature. Moreover, the ILs were easily recycled without structural change even after four cycles, and the yield of LA was up to 44% at the fifth cycle. Furthermore, TGA indicated that these SO3H-functionalized ILs exhibited excellent thermal stability. These efficient ILs will provide new options for converting biomass resources to LA and other chemicals.",
