II. Characterisation of the catalysts by DTA, SEM, FTIR, ESR and oxygen and ammonia chemisorption K.V. Narayana, A. Venugopal, K.S. Rama Rao, S. Khaja Masthan, V. Venkat Rao, R Kanta Rao* Catalysis and Physical Chemistry Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007, India Received 8 January 1997; received in revised form 22 August 1997; accepted 22 August 1997 Abstract In an earlier communication the ammoxidation activity of V205/TiO2 catalysts with V205 loadings in the range 0.4- 9.9 mol% was correlated to the average oxidation number of vanadium in the catalysts. In the present work, these catalysts were characterised by SEM, FI'IR, ESR, DTA techniques and chemisorption of NH3 and 02. The scanning electron micrographs of the catalysts indicate that deposition of vanadium is taking place inside the mesopores of titania (anatase) up to 3.4 tool% V205 corresponding to a monolayer coverage. Beyond this loading neddle-like and bulk structures of vanadia appear probably on the external surface of the catalysts. The bands at 1010-1020 cm-1 appearing in the FTIR spectra of fresh catalysts are characteristic of highly dispersed monomeric VOx units and two-dimensional structures. The FTIR spectra of the used catalysts are altogether different from those of the fresh catalysts suggesting that the active phase has been drastically modified during the course of the reaction. The ESR spectrum of 0.4 mol% V205 shows an eightfold well resolved hyperfine structure indicating that V4+ is in diluted conditions on anatase surface. As V205 content increases the hyperfine structure of ESR spectrum gets progressively smeared out due to strong coupling between V4+ dipoles. The results indicate that vanadium is in a highly dispersed distorted octahedral or square pyramidal geometry at 3.4 mol% corresponding to a monolayer coverage. The DTA curves contain endothermic peaks at 100-150 and 630-675 corresponding to desorption of adsorbed water and melting of vanadia particles and loss of oxygen from vanadia. Chemisorption of NH3 and O2 is observed to exhibit maximum at the monolayer V205 loading just as the ammoxidation activity of the catalysts. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

There are several isolated publications [ 10-16] on the application of spectroscopic techniques for the characterisation of active phase and adsorbed molecules [17,18] on these catalysts. A detailed study of the various surface species of one series of V205/ TiQ catalysts used for ammoxidation of 3-picoline [19] with a wide range of vanadia loadings is the 0926-860X/98/$19.00 '~2~ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fresh cal- cined catalysts whose preparation was reported earlier [19], were characterized by the application of SEM, ESR, DTA and chemisorption techniques. Both fresh and used catalysts were studied by FTIR technique with a view to ascertain the nature of different species on the vanadia phase and the modifications that occur during the course of the reaction. (78C) following the method of Parekh and Weller [20]. The catalysts were degassed at 150 for 2 h and then NH3 chemisorption was carried out at ambient temperature (25) by the double isotherm method [211. 3. Results and discussion 2. Experimental 2.1. Spectroscopic studies SEM studies of the catalysts were carried out using Hitachi Model S-520 (Japan) Scanning Electron Microscope at an applied voltage of 15 kV. The cata- lyst samples were mounted on aluminum stubs and were coated with gold in Hitachi HUS-5 GB vacuum evaporator. FTIR spectra of the catalysts were recorded on Nicolet-740 FTIR spectrometer. Self supporting discs were prepared from a mixture of KBr and catalysts by applying pressure for recording FTIR spectra. The FTIR spectra of the catalysts were recorded at room temperature. The pretreatment con- ditions of the catalysts were the same as for the ammoxidation reactions [19]. ESR spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Bruker ER 2000-SRC X-band spectrometer with 100kHz modulation at ambient temperature. 2.2. Thermal analysis studies 3.1. SEM results The scanning electron micrographs of pure titania (anatase) and pure V205 are given in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, and those of fresh calcined catalysts are given in Fig. 3. SEM studies on supported vanadia catalysts are few in the literature [10,11,22,23]. From Fig. 1 it appears that pure titania (anatase) contains a fine aggregate structure or a highly porous structure. Fig. 2 shows that pure vanadia has needles, flakes and bulk struc- tures. The electronmicrographs of the catalysts with V205 loading from 2.3 to 3.4 tool% (Fig. 3(C) and (D)) show that the catalysts have a very fine dispersion of vanadia on aggregates of TiO2. The SEM photo- graphs of 0.4 and 1.3 mol% V205 catalysts are not shown in the figure. The porous structure of anatase has been obscured by vanadia. However, Backhaus et al. [11] have observed the formation of long needle- like structures or whiskers of V205 after calcining 0.5% V2Os/anatase catalyst at 450 for 10 h. With increasing V205 content the whiskers become smaller. Differential thermograms of the samples were obtained on a Leeds&Northrup DTA unit (USA) in the range 25-900 at a heating rate of 10 min-~, using oe-alumina as a reference material. Grimsha pattern ceramic sample holders and cells were used for this purpose. 2.3. NH3 and 02 chemisorption studies Chemisorption capacities of the catalysts for NH3 and 02 were determined using an all glass high vacuum system capable of attaining pressures as low as 10-6 torr. The catalysts were reduced in H2 at 450 for 2 h prior to O2 chemisorption which was studied at 'acetone+dry ice' bath temperature Fig. 1. SEM photograph of pure anatase. K.V. Narayana et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 167 (1998) 11-22 13 Fig. 2. SEM photograph of pure V205. This effect continued with increasing V2Os/anatase ratio where bulk structures were observed. A compari- sion of the results of catalysts with V205 content below 3.4 mol% in the present case and those of Backhaus et al. [11] suggest that they might have used a low surface area titania/(anatase) support. The surface area of V205/TiO2 (anatase) catalysts has decreased from 79 to 55 mz g-1 when V205 loading is increased from 0.4 to 3.4mo1%. At 3.4 mol% V205, the catalyst has shown the highest activity for ammoxidation of 3-picoline [27]. All these observations point to the fact that vanadia is blocking the micropores and is also highly dispersed on the surface of large pores of TiO2 (anatase) in the present catalysts. The electronmicrographs of the catalyst beyond 3.4 mol% V205 (Fig. 3(E-G)) show that needle-like structures and flake-like bulk structures of V205 do form in the catalysts. Obviously, the formation of these structures has taken place on the external surface of high vanadia containing catalysts. The surface area of the catalysts further declined from 55 to 19.4 m2 g-~ with increase in V205 loading. Ki-Won Jun et al. [22] have made similar observations in their study. 3.2. FTIR results The FTIR spectra of fresh and used V205 and NH4VO3 are given in Fig. 4(A) and (B). The FTIR spectra of fresh and used V2Os/TiO2 catalysts are given in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. The time on stream of ammoxidation experiments varied from 20 h to 30 h. Fresh vanadia (Fig. 4(A)) has exhibited three dis- tinct bands at frequencies 1618, 1006, and 815 cm 1. Inomata et al. [12] have observed similar absorption bands at 1020 and 825 cm-l. The band at 825 cm-1 has been assigned to the coupled vibrations of V=O and V-O-V. The bands at 1020 and 840 cm 1 are assigned to the V=O stretching frequency and defor- mation of V-O-V bridges, respectively, by Freder- ickson and Housen [24]. Inomata et al. [12] and Nakagawa et al. [13] have assigned the band at 1006 cm-1 to stretching vibration of V=O. Tarama et al. [25] and Khulbe et al. [26] have observed V205 absorption bands at 1019 and 800 cm 1. The used V205 is observed to give a completely different spec- trum (Fig. 4(B)). The bands at 1644, 1015, and 562 cm-1 can certainly be attributed to V204 phase formed due to reduction of V205 during the course of reaction. Hausinger et al. [27] have shown that pre- sence of water vapour accelerates the formation of polyvanadate groups. Therefore the band at 1404 cm 1 may be attributed to the scissoring vibra- tion of NH+ ions present in the compounds like NHaVO3 and NH4V4OIo [28]. The band at 1404 cm-1 in reference spectra of pure NH4VO3 (Fig. 4C) further confirms our observation. The XRD results of the used catalysts after ammoxidation of 3-picoline have confirmed the presence of these compounds which were reported in our earlier com- munication [19]. The spectral characteristics of used catalysts are altogether different from those of the fresh catalysts. This observation suggests that drastic changes have taken place in vanadia phase of the catalyst during the reaction. The band at 1010-1039 cm 1, commonly occurring in the spectra of the fresh catalysts, should be ascribed to the stretching frequency of VOx units and VOx clusters [29]. The intensity of the bands at 1600- 1630 cm-l and 3300-3700 cm 1 (not shown in the figure) which may be ascribed to deformation vibra- tions of adsorbed water and surface OH groups, respectively, decreases as the amount of adsorbed water and the number of OH groups decrease on anatase surface as it is being progressively covered by increasing vanadia species.

The bands at 994 and 940 cm 1 in 7.2 mol% V205 catalyst (Fig. 6G) can be attributed to surface VOx species. The intensity of the bands at 948 and 885 cm i is observed to increase with vanadia loading in the spectra of used catalysts. These can be attributed to symmetric stretching vibrations of V=O bonds of VO, clusters [32,33]. 3.3. ESR results Several investigators [34-38] have carried out elec- tron spin resonance (ESR) studies on supported vana- dia catalysts. A detailed study of different aspects of electron spin resonance of VzOs]YiO2 system has not been done so far. In the present work, ESR measure- ments were carried out with a view to investigate the influence of vanadia loading on the co-ordination geometry of vanadium oxide structures and the elec- tron delocalization of anatase supported V205 cata- lysts. The ESR spectra of the catalysts with V205 loading in the range 0.4-9.9 tool% are presented in Fig. 7. The spectra were analysed using an axial symmetric spin Hamiltonian, H [14,15], H = ~(gllt-I, Sz + gxSx + gvSy) + allSzlz + AS~Ix + Sy!v) (1) where [3 is the Bohr Magneton, gll and gare the parallel and perpendicular principal components of the g tensor, H~, H~, H: are the components of the magnetic field, Sx, S?, St and Ix, I>, I~ are the compo- nents of the spin operators of the electron and the nucleus, respectively. The number of ESR absorption peaks is given by 2I+1 values of ml, where ml is the spin quantum number of the nucleus and the magnetic field positions of the peaks that occur are given by HII = 2Ho/gll - (all/g!ll3)m, (for O ---- 0) (2) H= 2Ho/g- (Ag3)ml (for O = 1I/2) (3) where O is the angle between symmetry axis of paramagnetic species and the applied magnetic field (H). By plotting the magnetic field of the observed peaks corresponding to either HII or Hagainst the values of the nuclear spin quantum number MI, one can obtain a linear relation as shown in Fig. 8. The slopes and the intercepts with the m~=0 line have been used to derive the values of the desired parameters like gll, All, gand Aetc. These values and other para- meters calculated from them are given in Table 1.

V2O5 concen- trations are the same as in Fig. 5. (I) Pure VzOs. They show that the g tensor of V4+ ions exhibits axial symmetry and the parallel components are smaller than the perpendicular ones (gij<g. This fact shows that the catalysts have V4+ ions in distorted octahedral or possibly in square pyramidal geometry. It can also be seen from Table 1 that the difference between g and gll is very small, because A (the energy of separation between the energy levels T and E in a crystal field) seems to be large [39,40]. The energy of separation (A) is related to g factor by the following expressions: gll = ge - 8A/A]; g= ge - 2/Vz2x2 (4) where A1 corresponds to b2---~eli transition and A2 to b2---,bl transition. The variation in these values occurs because of the variation in the ligand environment of V4+ as the concentration of V205 changes. This in turn causes changes in the values of A leading to variation in g values. From Fig. 7, it is clear that for the catalyst with lowest loading (0.4 mol% V205), the V4+ ions can be considered to exist in diluted conditions. Therefore hyperfine lines are well resolved. As the concentration of V2Os increases the number of V4+ ions increases, particularly in the presence of TiO2. This results in the strong coupling among V4+ dipoles leading to exchange interactions among them. This results in the smearing out of hyperfine splittings (hfs) progres- sively as the concentration of V2Os goes up from 0.4 to 9.9 mol% where the spectrum nearly corresponds to a broad single line without well-resolved hyperfine structures.

Magnetic field (H) vs nuclear quantum number, ml for 0.4 mol% V205 catalyst. Fig. 9 shows the factors Ag~ (ggll) and the quantity B (Agll/Ag, where Agll=ge-gll and Ag-ge-gare plotted against vanadia loading of the catalysts. It is interesting to note that both the curves pass through maxima at a VzO5 loading of 3.4 mol%, which corresponds to the formation of monolayer of the active phase on the surface of the support. This indicates that the degree of distortion is higher in the case of 3.4 mol% V205 catalyst, which may be due to high dispersion of VO,. species on the surface of the support. According to Sharma et al. [41], the quantity B reflects changes in the tetragonal distortion. An increase of B indicates a shortening of V=O bond along the principal axis or a lengthening of the distance to the in-plane oxygen ligands in the basal plane. An increasing distance between the four elec- tron-rich-ligands and the central vanadium ion will in return result in a stronger coulomb attraction of vana- dyl oxygen. Therefore, the observed variation in B should be related to the changes in both geometries (in-plane and to the plane) of VO2+. These in turn give rise to the observed consequences for the activity of the catalyst as they both correspond to the strength- ening of V=O bonds. However, Deo and Wachs [4] have not found a correlation between the methanol oxidation activity and the terminal V=O bond strength in monolayer vanadia catalysts supported on various oxides like TiO2, A1203 and ZrO2. They have assumed that the activity of the catalyst depends on the reac- tivity of the oxygen in the V-O-support bond. The results of the present ESR study seem to lend support to their contention. |t appears that the shortening and strengthening of the terminal V=O bond results in the lengthening and weakening of the V-O-support bond at a monolayer coverage because of which the oxygen in this bond becomes more reactive and the catalyst exhibits the highest ammoxidation activity. It is worth commenting on the ratio of the hyperfine coupling constants (AII/A.), which reached a maxi- mum value of 3.2 (Table 1) at 3.4 mol% V205 load- ing, which is a monolayer catalyst. This is certainly consistent with changes observed for g-parameter and K.V.

Variation of ZxGa (ggll) and the quantity B (~gll/~g as a function V205 loading. correlates well with the vanadia loading giving the highest ammoxidation activity at 3.4 mol% [19]. Another parameter which also reflects the observed significance for 3.4 mol% V205 catalyst is /3*2 [36] which is given by t~2 = 7/6Agil _ 5/12Ag- 7/6(Arl -AP) A value of P=184.5 G [42] has been used in the calculations. It is interesting to observe that S2 remains almost constant at 0.65 (Table 1) up to a V205 loading of 3.4 tool% and then decreases to 0.61 which again remains constant in the catalysts with V205 loadings at and above 4.7 tool%. This could also be attributed to the formation of highly dispersed VOx species on the catalysts with low vanadia contents. 3.4. Differential thermal analysis results The differential thermograms of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 10. The thermograms contain only endothermic peaks. The intensity of the endothermic peak from 100-150 is the highest for 0.4 mol% V205 catalyst (A) and decreases as the vanadia content increases. Catalyst (A) has maximum amount of adsorbed water on its surface and this decreases as anatase surface is gradually interacted and covered by increasing amounts of vanadia. A second endothermic peak appears at 630-675 in the thermogram of 3.4 tool% V205 catalyst (D) and its intensity increases with vanadia loading. Bond et al. [16] have ascribed this peak to melting of vanadia on the catalyst surface. Another endothermic peak appears at 680-750 in the thermograms of the catalysts with V205 loadings at and above 5.9 tool%. Bond et al. [16] have also observed this peak and ascribed it to the process of oxygen loss. 3.5. NH3 and 02 chemisorption The 02 and NH3 uptakes per unit surface area of the catalysts along with their BET surface areas are pre- sented in Table 2. The irreversible 02 uptakes at 78 on the reduced catalysts and the NH3 uptakes at ambient temperature on the catalysts degassed at 150 are presented in Fig. 11. It is clearly seen from the figure that the chemisorption of both the adsorbate gases increases with VzO5 loading and passes through 20 K.V.

V205 concentrations are the same as in Fig. 5. a maximum at 3.4 mol% V205 loading and thereafter declines considerably. The change in the trend of chemisorption of the gases is the same as the ammox- idation activity of these catalysts up to 3.4 mol% V205 reported in the earlier communication [19]. Rao and Narsimha [43] have observed a similar correlation between the irreversible uptakes of these gases and methanol oxidation activity of V2Os/TiO2 catalysts. According to Kantcheva et al. [44] isolated monoox- ovanadyl groups and two-dimensional vanadium oxide clusters exist at low vanadia coverages at and below a monolayer. A separate V205 phase and poly- vanadates are observed at higher coverages on VeOs/ TiO2 catalysts. The very high NH3 uptakes indicate that NH3 chemisorption occurs on Lewis acid sites (V=O) as well as on Bronsted acid sites (V-OH). NH3 is coordinated to V5+ ions causing rearrangement in the VOx surface species [44]. The adsorption sites for NH3 increase with increase in monomeric vO, units and the two-dimensional structures as the V205 con- centration increases up to a monolayer coverage. The coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) on V4+ ions which chemisorb oxygen irreversibly also go on increasing up to a monolayer coverage. The adsorption sites of NH3 and 02 per g of catalyst gradually decrease as crystalline V-oxides and poly- vanadates are formed when V205 concentration is 400 300 | ',1-O1 -6 E 200 cJ t~ :~ 100 I I I I I/- 0 4 6 8 10 mole % V205 Fig. 1 l.

However, the adsorption site densities per unit surface area of the catalysts remained more or less constant beyond 3.4 mol% vanadia loading (Table 2). According to Bond et al. [45], the joint effect of the V=O and V- OH groups determines the good catalytic properties of VzOs/TiO2 (anatase) catalysts in selective oxidation reactions [46]. Perhaps such an effect is very much pronounced in a monolayer catalyst for ammoxidation reaction also. From the isotopic transient studies Janssen et al. [17] have concluded that the monolayer catalyst has the highest exchangeability of oxygen. The highest participation of lattice oxygen in a mono- layer catalyst is perhaps responsible for its highest chemisorption capacity and for ammoxidation activity [19]. 4. Conclusions The spectroscopic studies of V2Os/TiO2 catalysts reveal that gradual changes take place in the structure of vanadia phase with the increase in vanadia con- centration. SEM studies indicate that deposition of vanadia occurs inside the mesopores of TiO2 (anatase) till the monolayer coverage (3.4 mol% V2Os). FTIR spectra of fresh catalysts are characteristic of highly dispersed VOx species and two-dimensional structures at and below monolayer coverage of vanadia. The spectra of used catalysts show that drastic changes have taken place in the structure of the active phase during the course of the reaction. The hyperfine structure of the ESR spectra of fresh catalysts reveal that vanadium is in a highly dispersed form in the catalysts up to a monolayer coverage where the cata- lyst has exhibited the highest ammoxidation activity. The DTA studies have shown three endothermic peaks corresponding to desorption of adsorbed water, melt- ing of vanadia and evaporation of oxygen from vana- dia. Chemisorption of ammonia and oxygen is observed to be maximum on a monolayer catalyst just as the ammoxidation activity of the catalyst indicating the existence of a maximum number of adsorption sites.

Kanta Rao * Catalysis and Physical Chemistry Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007, India * Corresponding author. Fax: +91 40 717 3387 In an earlier communication the ammoxidation activity of V2O5/TiO2 catalysts with V2O5 loadings in the range 0.4–9.9 mol% was correlated to the average oxidation number of vanadium in the catalysts. In the present work, these catalysts were characterised by SEM, FTIR, ESR, DTA techniques and chemisorption of NH3 and O2. The scanning electron micrographs of the catalysts indicate that deposition of vanadium is taking place inside the mesopores of titania (anatase) up to 3.4 mol% V2O5 corresponding to a monolayer coverage. Beyond this loading neddle-like and bulk structures of vanadia appear probably on the external surface of the catalysts. The bands at 1010–1020 cm−1 appearing in the FTIR spectra of fresh catalysts are characteristic of highly dispersed monomeric VO x units and two-dimensional structures. The FTIR spectra of the used catalysts are altogether different from those of the fresh catalysts suggesting that the active phase has been drastically modified during the course of the reaction. The ESR spectrum of 0.4 mol% V2O5 shows an eightfold well resolved hyperfine structure indicating that V4+ is in diluted conditions on anatase surface. As V2O5 content increases the hyperfine structure of ESR spectrum gets progressively smeared out due to strong coupling between V4+ dipoles. The results indicate that vanadium is in a highly dispersed distorted octahedral or square pyramidal geometry at 3.4 mol% corresponding to a monolayer coverage. The DTA curves contain endothermic peaks at 100–150°C and 630–675°C corresponding to desorption of adsorbed water and melting of vanadia particles and loss of oxygen from vanadia. Chemisorption of NH3 and O2 is observed to exhibit maximum at the monolayer V2O5 loading just as the ammoxidation activity of the catalysts.
