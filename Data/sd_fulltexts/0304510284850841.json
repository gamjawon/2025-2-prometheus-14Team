Summary The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene catalyzed by ZrCu(P04)4 is described. A mechanism based upon a consideration of the structure of the layered phosphate is presented which involves a bridged dicopper dioxygen complex. The reduction of Cu(II) to the metal and the nature of the metal particles is also described. The layered compounds have been pillared to different interlayer distances by organic phosphonates, and the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on these derivatives compared to the same reaction on the unpillared zirconium phosphate. Novel polyether derivatives of layered zirconium phosphates have been prepared, and some of their complexing behavior described. Introduction The study of Group IV layered phosphates is attractive from a number of viewpoints. In the first place, several types have now been synthesized [1] and there is every reason to believe that new layer types will be discovered. In some instances, single crystals can be grown and their structures deter- mined by X-ray methods, so the systems can be well-defined. Furthermore, it has been possible to prepare amorphous gels and then to build in any required amount of crystallinity [2, 3]. Since the surface area of the solid depends upon the crystallinity, this becomes an important property to con- trol when considering catalytic applications. More recently, a wide variety of organic derivatives have been prepared [4,5], and this development has opened up new opportunities for utilization of layered materials as molec- ular sieves and catalysts. Thus, these systems may allow the manipulation of molecular architecture to achieve desired chemical behavior. In this paper we will describe some of the more salient features of these compounds in rela- tion to their use as catalysts, and particularly catalyst supports. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 252 Structure of zirconium phosphates The two major Group IV layered phosphate types have been designated as a- and 7-. Some principal examples are collected in Table 1. In this dis- cussion we will use the a- and 7-zirconium phosphates, designated hereafter as a-ZrP and -y-ZrP, respectively, as prototypes of the two groups. A con- sideration of the structures of these two compounds is essential to what follows.

(From ref. 6, with permission.) 253 A portion of the layer of a-ZrP is shown in Fig. 1 [6, 7]. The metal atoms lie slightly above and below ( 0.25 A) the mean plane and are bridged by phosphate groups. These are situated alternately above and below the metal atom planes, with three oxygen atoms of each P043\" group bonded to three different zirconium atoms. The fourth oxygen bears a proton and points away from the layer. In Fig. 1, the metal atoms are placed in the plane and this arrangement produces a pseudo-hexagonal cell with a^ ^ b^ ^ 5.24 A and Ch = 22.6 A. The true cell is monoclinic with a = 9.060(2), b = 5.297(1), c = 15.414(3) A, 0= 101.7 [7]. Reference to Fig. 1 shows that the alternating metal and phosphate bridging forms 12-membered rings in a crown arrangement. If the phosphates are below the plane, then the ring is capped by a phosphate group above the plane and vice versa. The whole arrangement assumes an open cup-like form. Adjacent layers are shifted relative to each other by l/3uh, 2/3&ii- This places one 12-membered ring capped on the top over another capped on the bottom, the whole making a six-sided cavity as shown in Fig. 2. The inter- layer distance is 7.55 A. Only van der Waals' forces hold the layers together, as all the hydrogen bonds between P OH and H^O are either on the upper or lower surface of a layer and not between layers [6 - 8]. There is just 1 mol of cavities per formula weight and the largest free volume of the entrance ways would allow a sphere of 2.62 A diameter free passage [7, 9]. The structure of 7-ZrP is not known, but several factors point to the fact that the layers have a different structure from those of cr-ZrP. The crystals are monoclinic with a = 5.376(2), b = 6.636(4) and c = 24.56(1) A, (3= 93.94 , making the interlayer distance 12.25 A [10, 11]. On dehydra- Fig. 2.

From their respective den- sities and planar areas ab, it can be calculated that a phosphate group in a- ZrP covers 24 A2 [12,13] of the surface, while in 7-ZrP the area covered is 17.8 A2. Thus the phosphate groups are more closely spaced in the 7-type layers [14]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene catalyzed by ZrCu(P04)2 We have examined a number of reactions, such as dehydration, isome- rization and dehydrogenation, using transition-metal exchanged forms of both a- and 7-ZrP. The results obtained in the dehydrogenation of cyclo- hexene are illuminating and illustrative of the results to be expected with these catalysts. Copper(II) is readily exchanged into a-ZrP in a number of ways [1]. The product is a tetrahydrate, ZrC^PO^^l-^O, with interlayer spacing of 9.4 A [15]. It is completely dehydrated at 400 C [15, 16] with resultant reduction of the interlayer distance to 8.0 A. The conversion of cyclohexene to benzene over ZrCu(P04)2 was exam- ined over the temperature range 200 - 360 C. Actually two reactions take place simultaneously, as some of the hydrocarbon burns to CU2 and H2U because the gas stream is rich in added oxygen [17]. The rate of the reaction was found to be first order in both oxygen and cyclohexene. In separate experiments, cyclohexane was sorbed onto the surface of the catalyst at about 200 C and found to oxidize completely to C0>2 and H2U when oxygen was injected into the catalyst chamber. Conversely, when 0^ was sorbed first, the injected hydrocarbon formed mostly benzene. The maximum sorption of oxygen was somewhat less than 1/2 mol per mol of Cu^ on the surface of the catalyst. Furthermore, the rate of the reaction decreased rapidly as the amount of exchanged Cu24\" fell below 95% of full exchange as shown in Fig. 3. These results may be interpreted with the aid of Figs. 1 and 4. Since in a-ZrP there is 1 mol of cavities per formula weight, each cavity in the interior of the crystal contains a copper ion. However, only half- cavities are present on the surface. Thus, only half the six-sided rings shown in Fig. 1 are occupied as shown in Fig. 4. We postulate that the active species formed by the sorbed oxygen is a weak dioxygen complex with two adjacent Cu2\"1' ions. The conversion of cyclohexene to benzene and water requires a transfer of four hydrogens and four electrons to the oxygen. The sequence of steps may be visualized as follows. The hydrocarbon, either sorbed or in the gas phase, transfers a proton to a lattice P 0\" group and an electron to the Cu(II). The resultant Cu(I) then transfers an electron to the dioxygen. Thus, successively superoxide and peroxide bridging across two copper ions takes place. This redox cycle repeats until the dioxygen is converted to 2H-iO. On the other hand, when no oxygen is sorbed, the hydrocarbon, on transfer- ring a proton to the lattice oxide ions, with the formation of CgHg:\", may 255 0 -<rvSfS ^ \\^r^/\\^ Q 0 G 92 94 96 98 100 DEGREE, ION EXCHANGE (%) Fig. 3.

Cu(II) ions are in adjacent cavities along lines perpendicular to the view shown. then transfer an electron to the copper ions, but there is no mechanism for subsequent transfer to oxygen. Thus continuation of this process would result in the reduction of Cu2\"*\" to copper metal with the formation of some benzene. However, this latter reaction is apparently slow and thus most of the anion partakes in a competitive reaction by the formation of the peroxo species CeHgOO:\". Bum-up of the hydrocarbon then proceeds by the normal oxidation mechanism [18]. The copper atoms on the surface are 5.3 A apart. In order to form the oxygen complex they need to move closer. It is seen in Figs. 1 and 4 that two copper ions may indeed approach each other unobstructed under the influence of the sorbed oxygen. A similar process occurs in hemocyanin where the copper(II) ions are 5.6 A apart [19], but on sorbing oxygen to form oxyhemocyanin approach each other closer (to about 3.6 A [20]). In the reaction just described, the surface area of the catalyst before exchange with Cu2* was of the order of 2 - 3 m2 g~1. It was of interest, therefore, to compare the reaction rate with that obtained for a higher sur- face area catalyst. We have shown earlier [12] that the surface area is a func- tion of the zirconium phosphate crystallinity, which in turn is controlled by the concentration of phosphoric acid and time used to reflux an amorphous zirconium phosphate gel. This is shown in Table 2. Large cations such as Cs\"1' and NH4* do not diffuse into the interior of a-ZrP, because the free volume 256 TABLE 2 The surface areas and surface proton contents of a-zirconium phosphates possessing different crystallinities a-ZrP sample Total NH4\"' uptake (mequiv g~1) Surface area (m2 g 1) NH41' exchange BET 2.5 48 0.498 72 90 3.5 48 0.440 64 4.5 48 0.180 26 34.6 6 48 0.135 20 9 48 0.054 7.8 7.8 12 50 0.038 5.5 - 12 100 0.022 3.2 12 336 0.021 3.0 1.8 \"Numbers refer to concentration of H3P04 and reflux times (h), respectively, used to reflux a zirconium phosphate gel. in the sides of the interlayer cavities is too small to allow unobstructed passage. However, no such barrier to exchange exists at the surface, and hence surface protons can be displaced. This fact was used as the basis for the determination of the surface areas of the samples shown in Table 2 [12, 13]. Since each proton represents a surface phosphate group which occupies 24 A2 of the surface, the area is readily calculated from the number of protons liberated. It is seen that the more crystalline the exchanger, the lower the surface area. A simple explanation is possible. The zirconium phosphate gel particles obtained by precipitation are very small and contain small pores [21, 22]. On refluxing in H3PU4, the particles grow and rapidly become non-porous. Thus, sample 4.5:48 and all samples with greater crys- tallinity are non-porous, and the change in surface area can be accounted for by the increase in particle size. We selected a high surface area a-ZrP (2.5:15) (surface area, 140 m2 g~1) as the support for Cu(II) ions. This catalyst initially exhibited a rate of reaction roughly several orders of magnitude greater than that of the low surface area catalyst [17]. However, in about 20 min the rate fell drastically, to become less than that of the low surface area catalyst under the same conditions, while the amount of CO^ generated did not decrease as much. The reasons for this behavior are not known, but we are continuing to exam- ine this reaction as a function of the total surface area of the catalyst. Organic derivatives Another method of increasing the surface area became available through the medium of pillared organic derivatives of zirconium phosphate. Alberti et al. [4] prepared compounds of the type Zr(RP03)2 and Z^ROPOs); by allowing appropriate aryl and alkyi phosphonates and phosphates to react 257 with acid Zr(IV) solutions. Subsequently, Dines et al. [5] showed that the layers could be pillared or anchored to each other by using diphosphates or diphosphonates. If a mixture of the diphosphonate and H3P04 is allowed to react with Zr(IV), monohydrogen phosphate groups are incorporated at many of the sites producing structures such as those shown in Fig. 5. We have prepared a large number of such derivatives, a few of which are listed in Table 3. Although copper ions can be exchanged into these organic deriv- atives, the products have not yet been sufficiently characterized to warrent catalytic studies. However, we do have some data on the dehydration of methanol as well as its conversion to hydrocarbons. The reaction was run in a conventional flow reactor and the products monitored by gas chromatography. Table 4 shows the results for a-ZrP as compared to some of the pillared derivatives. There is indeed a remarkable difference. The non-pillared zirconium phosphate produced mainly methane at temperatures of 400 C and above, while at lower temperatures the product was mainly dimethyl ether. However, with the pillared compounds, one sees a marked increase in the formation of C^ - hydrocarbons relative to ether production. These results need to be correlated to the pore size and surface areas of the pillared materials, and this work is in progress. However, it is clear now that we are able to prepare a series of pillared compounds in which the ratio of P OH to pillared groups can be closely controlled. We are proceeding towards better characterization of these materials and cor- relating their structural properties with the catalytic results. Supported metal particles We indicated in an earlier section that cyclohexene in the absence of oxygen reduced the Cu24\" ions in ZrCu(PC>4)2 to the metal. To gain a better understanding of this reaction, we examined the kinetics of hydrogen reduc- zr c 0 P o 0 ^ i\" Y A^S^- (a) (b) Fig. 5.

The reactions proceed by an Elovich-type equation after an initial induction period, and are strongly dependent on the H2 pressure. In the case of Cu(II), reduction to Cu(I) only occurs when the H; pressure is held below 150torr. The product is ZrCuH(P04)2. This compound is reduced further to Zr(HP04)2 with all of the copper metal present on the surface. It was postulated that the reaction takes place at surface exchange sites. A counter diffusion of ions than takes place, the protons moving into the lattice and the cation moving parallel to the layers towards the thin sides of the crystals. Electron micrographs of a single crystal of Ag(I)-exchanged a-ZrP confirmed this supposition [24]. The thin sides contained large globules of silver, while much smaller particles of silver formed on the flat surfaces parallel to the layers (Fig. 6). A slice parallel to these flat faces showed that particles of silver formed along cracks or other regions where space existed within the crystal [26]. The size of the metal particles can be controlled to some extent by the choice of support. Highly crystalline samples of a-ZrP have a small surface area, typically 1 - 3 m2 g~1. Large metal clusters of the order of 500 A are formed from fully loaded crystallites.

We have also reduced the metal particle size by reducing the amount of cation loaded prior to reduction. We are now attempting to exchange just a mono- layer of cation on the surface and observing the type of metal clusters formed. This technique is fraught with difficulty, but some progress is being made by first studying the types of complexes formed at the surface [25] and their behavior upon reduction. At this stage of our studies we have only examined one reaction catalyzed by metal supported on a-ZrP, the partial oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide by silver [26]. At the outset it was found that the silver was oxidized to Ag(I) and diffused back into the zirconium phosphate, converting oxygen to water. The same reaction occurs with copper metal [23] and can be ob- served even at room temperature. It was therefore necessary to block the exchange sites so that the cations could not diffuse back into the crystal lattice. This was done by first reducing Zr(AgP04)2 to produce the silver metal particles, and then exchanging sodium ion into the zirconium phos- phate. The oxidation of ethylene then proceeded in a normal fashion. The interesting point we observed is that the reaction was greatly influenced by the cation in the exchange site. The order of decreasing activity was Na\"*\" S Li\"*\" ^ K\"*\". These effects may also result from small amounts of the salts remaining on the silver particles and this point is being examined. In the case of the derivatives listed in Table 3, it might be expected that metal particles would also form in the cavities because of the larger inter- lamellar spaces. Reduction of Cu(II)-exchanged PP-1-2 was carried out at 100 C. Very reactive metal particles formed and these reoxidized to Cu(II) ions within a few minutes exposure to air. 261 Polyether derivatives of zirconium phosphate Yamanaka has demonstrated that ethylene oxide reacts directly with 7-ZrP to form a phosphate ester [27]. We have recently shown that similar derivatives can be formed with a-ZrP [28]. If the crystallinity of the sample is less than that of sample 4.5:48, then direct reaction occurs because the zirconium phosphate swells in water and ethylene oxide can diffuse into the interlamellar spaces. With samples of greater crystallinity, the reaction occurs only on the surface. Long reaction times and concentrated ethylene oxide solutions are necessary to increase the chain length, and products with a degree of polymerization approaching 3 are possible. However, we were interested in preparing long-chain polyethers to take advantage of the com- plexing and surfactant capabilities of polyether chains. Therefore, we pre- pared phosphates from polyether glycols and reacted these with Zr(IV). The products have the a-layered structure and swell by absorption of water. A schematic representation is shown in Fig. 7. When the polyether chain has a degree of polymerization of 8 - 9 the solid completely disperses into a col- loidal solution. These dispersions interact rapidly with electrolytes, com- plexes such as ruthenium bipyridyls and neutral molecules. The nature of these interactions is now under active investigation in our laboratory. We have also prepared diphosphates from the polyether glycols and bridged across layers. It is expected that such derivatives will behave some- what like cryptands. The determination of the properties of these com- pounds is being pursued. Fig. 7.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene catalyzed by ZrCu(PO4)4 is described. A mechanism based upon a consideration of the structure of the layered phosphate is presented which involves a bridged dicopper dioxygen complex. The reduction of Cu(II) to the metal and the nature of the metal particles is also described. The layered compounds have been pillared to different interlayer distances by organic phosphonates, and the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons on these derivatives compared to the same reaction on the unpillared zirconium phosphate. Novel polyether derivatives of layered zirconium phosphates have been prepared, and some of their complexing behavior described. References 1 A.
