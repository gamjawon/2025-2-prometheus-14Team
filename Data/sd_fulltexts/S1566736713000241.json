The growth of bamboo-like multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without the formation of amorphous carbons was performed using copper-based catalysts by catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) with diluted ethylene at 700–900°C. The as-grown CNT soot was characterised by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The weak metal–support interaction of a sulphate-assisted copper catalyst (CuSO4/SiO2) can provide high-purity growth with remarkable yields of CNTs (2.24–6.10 CNT/g Cu·h) at 850–900°C. Additionally, hydrogen-assisted CVD can activate inert copper catalysts, e.g., Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 or Cu(CH3COO)2/SiO2, for the growth of CNTs. Highlights ► We report a method to grow carbon nanotubes without the formation of amorphous carbons. ► Weak metal–support interaction of sulphate-assisted copper catalysts can improve the growth quality of CNTs. ► The CNT growth yields will significantly increase at 800–900°C. ► Hydrogen-assisted CVD can activate inner copper catalysts for the CNT growth. Keywords Purity-controllable Bamboo-like Carbon nanotubes Copper catalysts 1 Introduction The growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been intensively studied for more than 20years. Nevertheless, the formation mechanism of CNTs is not yet fully understood despite recent advances in the growth of CNTs [1–3]. Structure-uncontrollable processes, low synthetic efficiency and undesired byproducts (e.g., amorphous carbon (a-C) and metal nanoparticles (NPs)) are three main challenges that limit the development of CNTs and further applications. Catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CCVD) is a promising route to solve the above-mentioned problems that has presented many new concepts [1–5]. Conventionally, CCVD using iron-group metal catalysts has greatly improved most of the aforementioned problems, namely structural control (e.g., chirality of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) [4]) and the growth efficiency of CNTs [5]. Although the preparation of high-purity CNTs is not currently a problem, most studies have discussed the optimum conditions for removing metal NPs instead of a-C, which will remain an uncertainty in further applications, especially in electronic devices. Recently, new progress in CNT growth using copper-group (Cu, Ag and Au) metal elements has been reported regarding the synthesis of SWCNTs in the temperature range of 750–950°C [6–9]. The main factors affecting the growth of CNTs using copper-group metals are the size of metal clusters and possibly the solubility of carbon on the nano-scale and the chemical composition of the metal catalysts [6,7]. Additionally, previous studies have noted that copper catalysts are sensitive to carbon sources in growing CNTs [8,10]. In fact, copper-based metal catalysts are sensitive to carbon sources and to the structural composition of growing CNTs, which is why diverse results have been obtained even for copper catalysts prepared using a similar procedure with the same catalysts precursors or under similar CNT growth conditions [6–13]. In our previous study, we found that the sulphated-assisted copper catalyst CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 exhibited high CNT growth activity (2.3g CNT/g Cu·h) at 750–850°C through a synergistic interaction between Cu NPs, SO4 −2 and Al2O3 during CVD [8]. This finding suggests that if copper NPs can be fixed in typical thermally stable structures, it will effectively lead to a high activity for CNT growth. Nevertheless, one major weakness of this study is the high ratio of a-C/CNTs (20–55%) observed in the as-grown CNT soot over CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Here, we aimed to achieve high-yield CNT growth without the production of a-C through two simple adjustments: (1) by replacing the γ-Al2O3 support with amorphous SiO2 and (2) by adding hydrogen to the carbon feedstock. These two adjustments produced bamboo-like CNTs of extra-high purity (approximately 100%) with a remarkable growth yield of 6.10g CNT/g Cu·h. These findings provide new insights into CNT growth using non-magnetic metal nanoparticles. In addition, the synthesis of CNTs on Cu NPs without a-C represents a new in-situ technology for developing electronic devices, e.g., field emitters [14] or lithium-ion battery [15], without the electromagnetic interference associated with conventional iron-group catalysts. 2 Experimental Copper catalysts were prepared by impregnating metal oxide supports (γ-Al2O3 (132m2/g), Degussa Co. and SiO2 (254m2/g), Cabot Co.) with the required amounts of the following aqueous solutions: CuSO4·5H2O (99.9%, Aldrich), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99.9%, Aldrich) or Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (99.9%, Aldrich). The initial ratio of copper in the catalysts was fixed at approximately 10wt.% for each sample and further quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (PE-SCIEX ELAB 6100 DRC) to be 10.2wt.% for CuSO4/γ-Al2O3, 9.9wt.% for CuSO4/SiO2 and 10.1wt.% for Cu(NO3)2/SiO2. Prior to CNT growth via the CVD process, the prepared samples were dried in oven at 120°C for 16h without any oxidation or reduction treatments. The CNTs were synthesised in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (1cm in outer diameter and 20cm in length). Typically, a catalyst sample (approximately 100mg) was placed in the reactor and heated to the required temperatures (500–900°C) under helium flow (40mL/min). Once the synthesis temperature was reached, the reaction was initiated by introducing a flowing C2H4/He mixture (flow rate=100mL/min, C2H4/He ratio at 1/9) over the required time periods. The CNT yield and the amount of amorphous carbon were characterised by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA Q500) according to previous studies [8,16]. A parametric study for the CNT growth over various copper catalysts is shown in Table 1 . A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-JEM 2100) was used to investigate the structural morphologies of the as-grown CNTs. Raman scattering spectroscopy (JOBIN-YVON T64000) with a laser excitation wavelength of 532nm was used. 3 Results and discussion TEM micrographs of the as-grown CNTs or a-C produced using various copper-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 1a–c. Fig. 1a, for the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, shows as-grown multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) clustered with numerous a-C. In a blank test, we did not observe any forms of carbon species deposited on pure γ-Al2O3 at elevated temperatures under the same CVD conditions. It was noted that a stronger metal–support interaction (MSI) between sulphated-Cu NPs and γ-Al2O3 could improve the decomposition rate of the hydrocarbons and the diffusion rate of the deposited carbon species simultaneously [16]. Therefore, a weak MSI effect for the copper catalysts should improve the problem of a-C formation. Interestingly, when we replaced the γ-Al2O3 support with amorphous SiO2, the growth of unwanted a-C was effectively terminated, as shown in Fig. 1b. Bamboo-like MWCNTs are the main products, with the outer diameters of the tubes ranging from 20 to 80nm for those grown over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalysts. However, when Cu(NO3)2 or Cu(CH3COO)2 were used as the catalyst precursors, regardless of whether the support was SiO2 or γ-Al2O3, only a-C-covered Cu NPs were observed after CVD with diluted ethylene. Typical and magnified TEM images are shown in Fig. 1c–d. The images show that free-standing Cu NPs in non-structure-stabilised copper catalysts, e.g., Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 and Cu(CH3COO)2/SiO2, could easily deactivate during the CVD process. In our previous studies [8,16,17], we found that copper catalysts prepared by impregnating various copper precursors, such as Cu(NO3)2, Cu(CH3COO)2 or Cu(thd)2 (thd=2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate), on amorphous SiO2, Al2O3 or silicon wafer will form copper catalysts with free-standing Cu NPs, which only generated a-C after ethylene CVD process at 750–900°C. However, structure-stabilised copper catalysts, e.g., CuSO4/γ-Al2O3, sulphate-activated Cu(NO3)2/γ-Al2O3 or atomic layer epitaxy-Cu/SiO2 catalyst with MSI, can generate MWCNTs with the same CVD conditions. It was noted that free-standing Cu NPs can yield the growth of CNTs, especially SWCNTs [6,19] or aligned SWCNTs [18], via CVD with alcohol-based feedstock. These findings depict that a crucial step for CNT growth over copper catalysts would be the decomposition route of carbon feedstock instead of the factor of catalysts precursors. Additionally, a method for properly controlling the decomposition routes of carbon-bearing molecules over copper catalysts could regulate the formation of CNTs or a-C. Hydrogen is ordinarily used to suppress the decomposition rate of carbon sources and to maintain the catalytic activity of metal NPs because it strips away unsaturated carbon species into gaseous hydrocarbons. Therefore, the addition of hydrogen to the carbon feedstock should activate the inert copper catalysts, e.g., Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 or Cu(CH3COO)2/SiO2. The clear re-activation of CNT growth over the inert copper catalyst Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 is presented in Fig. 1e. The growth yields of a-C (lower combustion temperature at 471°C) and CNTs (higher combustion temperature at 546°C) were characterised using oxidation TGA profiles and first-derivative curves as shown in Fig. 1f–g. The a-C and CNT peaks were assigned according to the results of previous studies [8,16]. In Fig. 1f-I, the yield of the as-grown carbon soot for CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 is approximately 28.24wt.% (5.65g soot/g Cu·h); however, the first-derivative curve (Fig. 1g-I) indicates a mixture of a-C (30%) and CNTs (70%). Therefore, the growth yield of the CNTs is approximately 3.96g CNT/g Cu·h. Accordingly, the CNT growth yields over the hydrogen-activated Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 and CuSO4/SiO2 catalysts are approximately 3.16 and 1.23g CNT/g Cu·h, respectively. Although the CNT growth yields are lower than the yield over the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, interestingly, the hydrogen-activated Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 and CuSO4/SiO2 catalysts could only generate CNTs without the formation of a-C, demonstrating only single peaks in Fig. 1g-II, III. This finding indicates that free-standing Cu NPs are easily deactivated by the encapsulation of a-C via the decomposition of hydrocarbons, which can be avoided by the addition of hydrogen to the carbon feedstock, leading to remarkably high-yield and high-purity CNTs. Sulphate-assisted copper NPs that do not interact strongly with the support lead to lower CNT yields; however, the purity of the CNTs is significantly improved. The Raman spectra of the as-grown CNTs synthesised over the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 and CuSO4/SiO2 catalysts are presented in Fig. 1h. The IG/ID ratio of the as-grown CNTs over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst is 1.09 (the same as those grown over the hydrogen-activated Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 catalyst). However, the IG/ID ratio of the CNTs grown over the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is lower, 0.86. This demonstrates that as-grown CNTs fabricated over CuSO4/SiO2 or hydrogen-activated Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 catalysts exhibit better graphitic features, which is consistent with the results of the TEM and TGA measurements. A typical TEM image of the as-grown CNTs fabricated using the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 2a. Branched (multi-branched, T-type and Y-type) and simple bamboo-like MWCNTs are the main products shown in Fig. 2b–e. Various branched MWCNTs were generated by moving or splitting of the Cu NPs under the CNT growth conditions. In this study, we consider the CNT growth mechanism for copper catalysts to be similar to that described by the vapour–solid–solid (VSS) model [19], owing to the low carbon solubility of the copper catalysts. Moreover, magnified images of a bamboo-like CNT before and after the transport of Cu NPs are shown in Fig. 2f and g, respectively. These indicate that the graphitic layers of the CNTs are parallel to the tube growth axis, which should obey the VSS model. Although the growth yield of the CNTs synthesised at 800°C over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst is only a quarter of that of the CNTs grown over the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivity towards CNTs is approximately 100%. An extremely high selectivity for CNT growth over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst suggests a potentially low-cost process that requires no further post-treatments. Nevertheless, the wide range of growth temperatures for the formation of CNTs over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst should be discussed. Therefore, we grew CNTs using the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst at various temperatures (500–900°C). The growth yields were characterised by TGA measurements and are shown Fig. 3 and Table 1. Surprisingly, although the combustion peaks of the samples shift to higher temperature and widen with increasing growth temperature, only CNTs were generated, without the formation of a-C, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. As shown, the CNT growth yields significantly increase at temperatures of 850–900°C. The CNT growth yield over the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst at 900°C displaying in Table 1 is approximately 6.1g CNT/g Cu·h, which is nearly 1.5 times that observed for the CNTs grown over the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. More importantly, the as-grown CNTs were fabricated with extra-high purity without the formation of a-C. Although the detailed mechanism needs more studies, a plausible reason is that the CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst should have higher activity for the decomposition of carbon source-ethylene through a stronger MSI between sulphated-Cu NPs and Al2O3 comparing to that of the CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst. Therefore, at 800°C, CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst could give higher CNT growth yield (3.96g CNT/g Cu·h) compared with that of CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst (1.23g CNT/g Cu·h). At higher temperature — 900°C, although the soot (CNTs+a-C) formation yield of CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is quite higher than that of CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst, however the ratio of a-C was estimated to approximately 55%, therefore the CNT growth yield is only 4.05g CNT/g Cu·h, which is similar to that generated at 800°C (3.96g CNT/g Cu·h). In other words, the formation of a-C on CuSO4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at 900°C is the main pathway. For CuSO4/SiO2 catalyst, higher temperatures could generally give higher decomposition rate of carbon source-ethylene to promote the growth of CNTs instead of a-C owing to a weak MSI. Similar results have been reported in a review article [20]. Nevertheless, a kinetic study for the decomposition of hydrocarbons and the formation of CNTs on various copper catalysts is under studying, and will be discussed later. In this study, our observations provide new insights into the CNT growth process using non-magnetic metal catalysts and into further integrated applications using Cu NPs and CNTs. 4 Conclusions We have developed a simple way of synthesising MWCNTs without the formation of a-C using copper-based catalysts through CVD at 700–900°C. The carbon source used is known to be a key factor for CNT growth using copper-based catalysts. With ethylene, hydrogen-assisted CVD can be used to synthesise CNTs over copper catalysts with free-standing Cu NPs. In this study, the growth yields of CNTs were dependent on the temperature, the addition of hydrogen to the carbon source and the metal–support interaction. Acknowledgements J. H.

        "dc:description": "The growth of bamboo-like multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without the formation of amorphous carbons was performed using copper-based catalysts by catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) with diluted ethylene at 700–900°C. The as-grown CNT soot was characterised by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The weak metal–support interaction of a sulphate-assisted copper catalyst (CuSO4/SiO2) can provide high-purity growth with remarkable yields of CNTs (2.24–6.10 CNT/g Cu·h) at 850–900°C. Additionally, hydrogen-assisted CVD can activate inert copper catalysts, e.g., Cu(NO3)2/SiO2 or Cu(CH3COO)2/SiO2, for the growth of CNTs.",
