The integral intensity of the 'Ag NMR line from Ag metal particles of the same catalysts increases in the same range of particle sizes. This is due to the large line broadening of the signal from the Ag particles of which the sizes are less than 400-500 A. The self-consistent calculations of the electronic structure of semi-infinite Ag(111) crystal show the large deviation of the local density of electronic states and 'Ag NMR Knight shifts for the first surface layers of Ag compared with Ag bulk.

Introduction The effect of the size of metal particles upon their electronic structure is of fundamental importance for the variety of their properties including adsorption and catalysis [ 1 ] . The 109Ag NMR spectroscopy recently has been successfully applied for studies of supported Ag catalysts [ 2-5 ] . The results obtained in these studies show that 1Ag NMR line width depends upon the size of supported Ag particles, thus demonstrating the effect of surface on the electronic properties of metal particles (quantum size effect). For the detailed study of this phenomenon one needs to deal with monodispersed metal par- * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we present the results of the catalytic, 1Ag NMR and quantum chemistry studies of silver particles supported on A1203 and Si02 and having distinct distributions of their sizes. We are reporting the data on the change of catalytic activity in ethylene epoxidation and the 'Ag NMR spectra integral intensity as function of particle size, which we attribute to change of the electronic properties of the surface and subsurface layers compared with those for Ag bulk. The selfconsistent calculations of the local density of electronic states and of the Knight shifts performed for semi-infinite Ag(111) crystal show the large deviation of these parameters for surface and subsurface layers in relation to the Ag bulk. 176 2. Experimental V.M. Mastikhin et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 96 (1995)175-179 The samples of catalysts were synthesized by impregnation of supports (A1203 or Si02) with the amino complex of silver. Drying was performed by a low temperature contact method. Reduction of the silver to a metal state was carried out in vacuum at 90 under rotation conditions. Reduced samples were washed with doubly distilled water and dried at 100. To obtain the samples with different Ag particle sizes the variation of the concentration of impregnating solution as well as the repeated impregnation procedure were employed. The statistical size distribution of the Ag particles was measured with electron microscope JEOL-100CX (5point to point resolution). The typical, near log-normal distributions of the particle sizes of the series of the Ag catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. The catalytic activity was determined with the use of a flow-recycling reactor at a pressure of gas mixture 1 atm, temperature 230 at an ethylene conversion of 15%. The reaction mixture contained 2 vol.% of ethylene, 7 vol.% of oxygen and 91 vol.% of nitrogen. The reaction products were analyzed by chromatography. The lo9Ag NMR spectra were measured on Bruker MSL-400 NMR spectrometer at frequency 18.717 MHz. The frequency range was 10 kHz, the duration of radio-frequency pulse 18 As, the pulse repetition time 0.15 s. The chemical shifts were measured relative a signal of Ag powder with particle size about 104 Magic angle spinning 32 24I 18I 8I was performed in a cylindrical Zr02 rotor, frequency 2-3 kHz. The electronic structure of a semi-infinite face Ag (111) of Ag single crystal has been calculated by a tight-bonding version of linearized muffintin orbitals method (LMTO-TB) [ 6 ] . The s-, pand d-states of crystal atoms were taken into account. The crystal surface was considered by the Green function method [ 7 ] . The surface and subsurface Ag planes were treated self-consistently. The XPS data obtained on VG Escalab HP spectrometer demonstrated that an Ag 3d5/2 line (367.9 eV) and its shape as well as a position of valence band (4.5 eV) were the same for all the samples, indicating that the silver in metallic state was presented on support surface. 3. Results 3.1. Rate of the ethylene epoxidation Fig. 2 demonstrates the dependence of the logarithm of the rate of ethylene epoxidation R upon the average size of Ag particles for Ag/A1203 and Ag/Si02 samples. It follows from Fig. 2, that within the wide range of Ag crystal sizes (from 0 500 to 2000 A) the epoxidation rate only slightly increases its value both for Ag/A1203 and Ag/ Si02 catalysts. However, the drastic decrease of R was found for the catalysts with the mean particle sizes smaller than about 500 A.

For the catalyst with particle sizes lower than 200 no 'Ag NMR signal has been detected. The signal of very small intensity has been found for the samples containing Ag particles of 240 and 300 in diameter. The increase of the signal intensity took place for the particles larger than 400-500 A. Another interesting feature of the 'Ag NMR spectra was found to be the asymmetry of the line for the samples which have the intermediate size of Ag particles. Fig. 4-A illustrates the tAg NMR MAS spectrum of 8 wt.% Ag/A1203 catalyst. The use of the magic angle spinning removes the dipole-dipole broadening of the line (its value is about 100 Hz [ 3 ] ) , thus reducing the NMR line width. Formally, this spectrum could be deconvoluted upon two lines: a Gaussian line with the chemical shift and line width typically observed in the spectra of large Ag metal particles [ 3-5 ] -20 s 0.2 200 600 1000 10000 MEAN PARTICLE SIZE, 0 Fig. 3. The dependence of 'Ag NMR signal intensity (per 1 g of supported Ag) upon the mean particle size of Ag/20j catalysts relative to the intensity of signal from bulk metal ( particles = 10000 A>. reaction rate was found to be about two orders of magnitude compared with Ag powder particles ( = 10000 . It seems this is the first unambiguous demonstration of the catalytic size effect for Ag supported catalysts, e.g., the dependence of reaction rate upon the crystal size. It becomes possible due to the use of the samples with narrow distribution of particle sizes. This dependence clearly demonstrates the impact of the Ag particle sizes upon their catalytic activity in ethylene epoxidation. 3.2.

For the sample with a mean particle size 240 (16 wt. % Ag/ Si02) the broad asymmetric line of small intensity shifted to high field indeed was detected in the spectrum (Fig. 4-B) . These data show that the small Ag particles (less than 400-500 have the to9Ag NMR characteristics (line width, chemical shift and, most probably, also spin-lattice relaxation rate Tt) which are different from those for Ag bulk and do not contribute to the spectrum of catalysts which have the large particles; the latter have tAg NMR parameters typical for Ag bulk. 3.3. Electronic structure of surface and subsurface layers of Ag(ll l) crystal Since the tAg NMR spectra indicate the difference in tAg NMR characteristics of small and large Ag particles and therefore the difference in the electronic structure of surface and subsurface layers of Ag crystal from those for bulk Ag, the electronic structure of the semi-infinite crystal Ag (111) has been calculated. The populations of s-states - (n) and their densities near the Fermi surface - (o-) for the first eight layers of the Ag (111) surface and for the Ag bulk are collected in the Table 1, together with the values of Knight shifts 8 in the units of the Knight shift 4H/H for Ag bulk. The latter were calculated with the use of relation dHIH= (no- -nBOB) /nBOB where n and o- are populations of s-states and their densities near Fermi surface respectively; nB and QB are those for Ag bulk. The data in the Table 1 show that the populations of s-states, their densities near the Fermi level and the Knight shifts for the surface and subsurface layers are quite different from those for Ag bulk. Unexpectedly, the Knight shifts for the first two layers are larger than for bulk metal, while for the next layers they become smaller than the value for bulk metal. These results explain the large broadening of the tAg NMR line from the surface and subsurface layers of Ag crystals as caused by the spread of the resonance over large frequency range. 4. Discussion The results presented above show that the use of the Ag catalysts with sharp distributions of Ag particle sizes has allowed us to obtain the interesting information on the dependence of the properties of small Ag particles upon their size. For the first time the effect of particle size upon the catalytic activity in ethylene epoxidation has been clearly demonstrated. The increase of the rate constant about two order of magnitude has been observed when going from particles of 160 to 0 10000 A in diameter. This effect is most pronounced for the particles o up to about 500 A and is caused by the influence of the surface upon the electronic state of Ag atoms. Indeed, tAg NMR results show that the NMR characteristics and therefore the electronic properties of those Ag particles that are smaller than 400-500 are different from those for bulk metal. This follows directly from the drastic broadening of tAg NMR line for samples having the Ag particles with diameters less than this value. The most evident explanation of this effect is the spread of the Knight shifts of the NMR lines from Ag atoms located in the surface and subsurface layers of Ag crystals. Indeed, the direct cal- V.M. Mastikhin et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 96 (1995) 175-179 culation of the Knight shifts for Ag nuclei in the surface and subsurface layers of Ag(111) crystal shows their large deviation from the value for Ag bulk. Although the model of semi-infinitive crystal may need some corrections when going to the particles having 104 to 106 atoms it seems that at least qualitatively it explains the experimental '09Ag NMR data. It is remarkable that in the case of Ag particles the influence of surface propagates unexpectedly deep into the inner layers of Ag crystal (up to 200-250 A, or 70-80 layers from surface). This behavior is quite different from that for Pt particles, where the signal from metal bulk was observed for considerably smaller average particle sizes [ 8 ] . In '95Pt NMR spectra extremely broad lines (width =-- 5 MHz) have been detected for the most fine Pt/A1203 particles with the use of the special spin-echo methods. Due to about 100 times lower signal intensity compared with '95Pt NMR resonance, the broad signal from the most fine Ag particles has not been found in present work. Only the asymmetry of the ' Ag NMR line indicates the presence of the subsurface layers with electronic characteristics different from those for Ag bulk. Note that the line asymmetry was detected only in magic angle spinning spectra which decrease the dipole interaction between magnetic nuclei, thus allowing the detection of the inhomogeneously broadened line from those inner subsurface layers which have relatively moderate impact of surface. The difference between Pt and Ag particles can be either due to the different contributions to the Knight shift from s- and d-states in the two cases, 179 or due to the presence in the Pt samples studied in [ 8 ] of small uncontrolled amounts of the crystals, which have relatively large diameters. The presence even of small amounts of the latter may produce a large contribution to the signal intensity since it is proportional to the particle volume. 5. Conclusion Thus, combined catalytic, tAg NMR and quantum chemistry studies of Ag supported catalysts have revealed the profound influence of particle size upon their catalytic and electronic properties.
