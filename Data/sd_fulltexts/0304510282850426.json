Summary Despite numerous research efforts, the mechanism of methanol homologation and especially the role of iodine promoters remain unclear. In an approach to improve the understanding of this reaction, the basic properties of cobalt- iodine-phosphine catalyst systems have been studied. In addition, well-defined cobalt complexes and clusters were used as catalysts, and experiments with labelled reagents have been carried out. Based on these data a reaction mechanism via oxidative addition of methyl iodide to a cobalt(1) center is proposed. Introduction The first reports of the cobalt-catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of methanol to give ethanol or acetaldehyde date back to 1941 [ 1] - This CH30H f CO s HZ CH3CHO + HZO (1) CH3CHO ~ H2 CH3CHZOH (2) homogeneously catalyzed syngas reaction was introduced into the open literature by Wender et aL, who proposed C0Z(CO)s as the active catalyst precursor [ 2] . The reaction is significantly promoted by iodine, as was shown by Berty et al. in 1956 [3]. sT.igands such as phosphines were found to enhance the stability and selectivity of the catalyst system [4 - 61 . In order to improve the hydrogenation activity and thus the ethanol selectivity, ruthenium. compounds have been used in recent studies as cocatalysts of cobalt iodine catalysts [7, 81 . Though economic analysts lave estimated methanol homclogation more attractive for ethylene synthesis than methanol dehydration with molecular sieves or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [9] , no industrial application has been reported so far. This is due to the limited selectivity of the process, which gives rise to a variety of side 0304-51ss2/821000G-ss000/$G2.75 Elsevier Sequoia Printed in The Netherlands 316 products- Furthermore, the mechanism of methanol homologation is still unclear and contradictory proposals exist in the literature. In order to improve the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of this reaction, we have studied the basic properties of cobalt- iodine-ligand catalyst systems. Experimental All experiments have been carried out in 150 ml stainless steel autoclaves (No. 2.4610) equipped Nvzth a magnetic stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a syngas storage with a pressure-regulation system to maintain a constant reaction pressure. GC analysis was carried out on a 100 m Carbowax 1500 SCOT column (WGA) using toluene as internal standard. Methanol conversion was calculated from the unreacted methanol determined by GC_ Molar selectivities are based on converted methanol, and include a stoichiometric factor indicating the number of methyl groups in the molecule. GC/MS measurements were carried out on a Varian MAT 112 S/SS 200 system. Results and Discussion For our studies the catalyst system Co(OAc)Z-4H,0, Ph3P, and aqueous HI was chosen- With this system acetaldehyde is the prevailing product, and only minor amounts of ethanol are formed. This reflects the reduced hydrogenation ab:'_ity of the catalyst due to the iodine promoter. Also formed are acetals such as 1,1-dimethoxy ethane, 1-methoxy-1-ethoxy ethane, and 1,1-dimethoxy butane, esters such as methyl and ethyl acetate, ethers such as dimethyl and methyl ethyl ether, and acetaldehyde condensation products such as paraldehyde, crotonaldehyde, butyraldehyde and n-butanol. All products have been\"identified by GC/MS and by comparison with authentic samples. More than 20 reaction products have been detected in a homologation mixture by GC/MS [ 10] . The methanol conversion as well as proLiuct distribution is highly sensitive to the catalyst composition and reaction conditions. As is shown in Table 1, methanol conversion remains low in the absence of iodine. Even minor amounts of HI prornote the reaction significantly, and a maximum for conversion and acetaldehyde selectivity is found at I:Co = 2:1. At higher I/Co ratios the formation of ethers and acetaldehyde condensation products increases significantly. The variation of the P/Co ratio affects conversion rates only if a high excess of phosphine is used (P/Co > 3). In this case inhibition occurs which can be interpreted by blocking of active sites by excess of ligand. Addition of triphenyl phosphine improves the selectivity to acetaldehyde, acetals, and ethanol, and reduces the formation of ethers, acetaldehyde condensation products, and to some extent of acetates. Best results are observed at a P/Co ratio of 2:1. 317 TABLE 1 Effect of catalyst composition Conversion Molar selectivity (,, o) EtOH AcH acetafs acetates ethers F/Co ratio\" 0 -- 7.4 1.2 - 42 3.4 2.3 1 62 6.1 7.2 58 7.2 2.0 2 73 4.4 26 40 15 1.6 3 62 4.0 16 25 12 - 3.1 67 1.6 8.5 23 10 5.6 P/Co ratio b 0 69 5.9 20 41 20 6_8 1 76 3.9 18 29 18 3_0 2 73 4.4 26 40 15 1.6 3 71 3.1 16 52 11 1.2 4 ^- 11 - - 25 1.2 - Caalyst: CO(OAC)2-41420, Ph3P, IFI; coreditiorLs_ 300 Gar CO/H,- (1:1), 200 C, 2 h_ aP/CQ = 2:1_ bI/Co = 2=1_ The effect of reaction parameters is depicted in Table 2. Thus, at low temperatures acetals are formed selectively. With increasing temperature ti=e acetals a=e converted to acetaldehyde and ethanol. Best acetaldehyde yields are found at 180 - 200 C. Higher temperatures largely favour side product formation such as acetaldehyde condensation. Acettals also prevail at short reaction times. After 30 min an acetal selectivity of 73% is found. The yield of acetaldehyde and ethanol increases, at the cost of acetals, up to reaction times of 2 - 2.5 h. Longer reaction times lead to increased side product formation and in particular acetaldehyde condensates are found. . Another important factor is syngas pressure. The catalyst system is active even at low pressures, such as 100 bar, and mainly acetals are formed at low conversion rates. Increasing the pressure up to 300 bar results in an improved methanol conversion and in enhanced yields of acetaldehyde, ethanol, and acetates. At a pressure of 1000 bar, most of the acetals are converted to acetaldehyde, ethanol, and acetates, and selectivities of 36, 10 and 2490 are found, respectively. Though these results seem attractive, a syngas pressure of 300 bar was applied for further experiments. In accordance with earlier reports [111, a 1:1 CO:HZ mixture gives best results for methanol homologation. However it is interesting to note that syngas mixtures rich in hydrogen give rise only to reduced methanol conversion arid not to increased ethanol yields. In contrast, syngas mixtures rich in CO result ir_ remarkable selectivities for acetate fo,-oration. This is further evidence for the poor hydrogenation activity of this type of catalyst. 318 TABLE 2 Effect of reaction parameters on the catalyst Co(OAc)2/Ph3P/HI Parameter Conversion Molar selectivity EtOH AcH acetals acetates ethers Temp.

'Reaction time 2.5 h. bReaction temp. 190 C. The mechanistic role ol. iodine promoters is still not fully understood. For this reason we have examined various iodine compounds as activators for the catalyst system Co(OAc)Z/Ph.jP. With respect to their efficiency, they can be classified into three groups: HI = 11 = COf2 = Mel = EtI > Phf = HgzI> > Et4TNI = Bu4NI = Ph4NI = Ph3.MePI = Naf = KI = CsI. Effective promoters are selected from the first group, and the highest syngas uptake is observed for HI and I,. Clearly Less efficient are promoters from the second group, where an incubation period is observed for PhI. The ionic iodides from the last gr.~up are almost inactive. However, it is interesting to note that these ionic iodides are good activators in the absence of donor ligands such as Ph3P. Possibly phosphines prevent nucleophilic attack of I- on the cobalt center. 319 The oxidative addition of methyl iodide to Rh(I) has been shown to be the key step in methanol carbonylation f I2j . A similar process must be assumed in methanol homologation, since the stoichiometric hydrocarbonylation of methyl iodide has recently been reported by Ungvary and Marko [131 - The use of one-component catalysts selected from well-defined cobaltphosphine-iodine complexes may shed some light on the nature of intermediates in the catalytic cycle. Table 3 contains typical results of some of the complexes examined, which were selected according to their relative I/Co and P /Co ratios. Out of a variety of complexes, C012(Ph3P)2 gave the highest conversion rate and acetaldehyde/ethanol yield. Good results were also achieved with the anionic complex COI3(Ph3P)-. In contrast only low conversion rates and mainly acetal formation was found with cobalt(L~-iodine complexes. These findings are in good accordance with the results obtained with Co(OAc)2/Ph3P/bII. Thus it can be assumed that complexes of the type CoI,L2 play an important role as precursors of the catalytically active intermediates. For several syngas reactions, clusters have been proposed as catalytically active species or as catalyst precursors [14, 151. Thus it seemed attractive to examine the catalytic properties of clusters in methanol homologation. With the cobalt clusters Co4(CO)12, Co4I(CO) il, Co3(E.c3-CH)(CO)g, Co3(E13PPh)(CO)g, Cojpc-PPh)=(CO),o, Co2(je-PPhz)2(CO)6 and Co2(g-PPh)(CO)s only minor methanol conversions were achieved in the absence of iodine promoters, and mainly acetals were formed. In all cases, addition of methyl iodide led to a significant increase in activity. Table 3 contains the results obtained :with Co4(pCPPh)2(CO)lo, which according to Pittman et al. catalyses the hydrcformylation of per-terse without detectable decomposition [15) .

Addition of methyl iodide resulted in 63% methanol conversion and a similar product mixture as is obtained with mononuclear cobalt complexes. During the reaction the cluster decomposed completely, and only weak IR absorptions at 1899 cm -1 were observed in the reaction product. Carbon-bridged clusters such as C03013-CH)(CO)9 also decomposed under reaction conditions to give the results shown in Table 3. Though these results do not exclude clusters as catalyst precursors, they discourage the assumption of clusters as active species under these reaction conditions. The mechanistic proposals known for methanol homologation can be classified into two groups. Esterification according to eqn. (3) was originally proposed by Hecht and Kroper [ 16] CH30H HCo(C014 CH30H2Co(C014 H --- CH 3Co(COh (3) CO-insertion and hydrogenation would lead to the observed products. In contrast, Giesecke proposed carbene as the intermediate in methanol homologation which could react with hydrocobalt carbonyl to give a methyl cobalt species [1?] CH30H -H20 CH2 HCo(C014- HCHZCo(C014 The methyl group of reaction products formed according to eqn. (4) contains a hydrogen from the cobalt hydride which originates from synthesis gas. In order to distinguish between these two reaction paths, deuterated methanol was submitted to the homologation reaction at 300 bar CO/H2 (1:1), 200 oC and 2 h. The results are depicted in eqn. (5): CD3CH0 +CD3CH\" OCD3 \\ CD30D+CO/HZLCo:P P) 1 oCD3 (5) CD3CHZOH T CD3COOCD3 The GC/MS analysis of the reaction products showed unequivocally that the CD3 group of methanol remains intact during the course of the reaction, and can be detected in acetaldehyde, 1,1-dimethoxy ethane, ethanol, and methyl acetate. These results make carbene as an intermediate highly unlikely since a hydrogen/deuterium exchange should be observed in this case. In order to develop a mechanistic model it is worthwhile summarizing the results observed. It has been shown that ligands such as phosphines are able to control the course of homologation reaction to a large extent. Thus it seems likely that the ligands are coordinated to the metal center during 321 CH,oH Hz~ CH31 HI ICOILZ(CC1 1 w j' \\ i HCo? 2 Lz (CC) C+3-Coit LZ ICIJ1 0 HC~z;CCI CH3-G-CrI2 L2 ICOI 2 CH;CHa. 0 C i , CH3-C-CoL~tr~i CHy-C-Co:JIzLZ'!'CI 5 H2 Scheme 1. the catalytic cycle. Based on this assumption and on the observation that best results were obtained with a cobalt-phosphine-iodide ratio of 1:2:2, the mechanism shown in Scheme I is proposed. Oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the coordinatively unsaturated cobalt(I) species 1 gives the methyl complex 2 which undergoes CO insertion. Elimination of iodine from the acetyl complex 3 and oxidative addition of hydrogen gives 5. Reductive elimination of the primary product aldehyde leads to the unsaturated complex 6 which adds iodine oxidatively. The catalytic cycle is closed by epmination of hydrogen iodide from 7, which is consumed by reaction with methanol to give methyl iodide. The proposed mechanism is based on cobalt(I) and cobalt(FII) species, which are known at least as their Rh and Ir analogues [18 - 241. The process is controlled by catalytic amounts of methyl iodide, hydrogen iodide, and iodine which emphasizes the multifunctional role of the promoter. Only recently a mechanism for the rhodium-catalyzed synthesis of acetic anhydride was published proposing intermediates corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 [ 251. Studies are in progress to substantiate the different reaction steps by stoichiometric reactions and to isolatte intermediates from the reaction mixture.

        "dc:description": "Despite numerous research efforts, the mechanism of methanol homologation and especially the role of iodine promoters remain unclear. In an approach to improve the understanding of this reaction, the basic properties of cobalt-iodine-phosphine catalyst systems have been studied. In addition, well-defined cobalt complexes and clusters were used as catalysts, and experiments with labelled reagents have been carried out. Based on these data a reaction mechanism via oxidative addition of methyl iodide to a cobalt(I) center is proposed.",
