No. 2, Dagong Road, Liaodong Bay New District Panjin Liaoning PR China Graphical abstract Transformation of renewable biomass into chemicals has attracted much attention recently. Efficient catalytic dehydration of biomass-derived sorbitol into isosorbide over solid acid catalysts under moderate reaction conditions is still a technical challenge. A series of silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts were prepared by an ion-exchanged process, and dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide was performed under solvent-free conditions. More than 99% conversion of sorbitol was obtained with 83% selectivity of isosorbide over Ag1H2PW catalyst at 140 °C within 1 h, which are comparable with that using a homogeneous phosphotungstic acid (HPW) catalyst. The silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, Raman, NH3-TPD and Py-IR to build a relationship between the catalytic activity and their natures. Ag1H2PW exhibited much higher activity for catalytic dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide compared with Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW under the same reaction conditions, which was attributed to the stronger acidity and higher amount of Brönsted acid sites. Moreover, Ag1H2PW could be easily regenerated by 65% HNO3 solutions and used repeatedly at least 3 times without obvious loss of catalytic activity. Keywords Sorbitol Isosorbide Dehydration Silver-exchanged heteropolyacid 1 Introduction Biomass is an abundant and renewable carbon resource with great potential for sustainable production of chemicals. [1–7] Transformation of biomass into value-added chemicals has been studied intensively over the past few decades [1–12]. Sorbitol is considered as one of the most important platform molecules in biorefinery, and could be facilely produced through the hydrogenation of carbohydrates. [13–17] As one of value-added derivatives of sorbitol, isosorbide has a number of commercial and industrial applications in the field of cosmetic, polymers, drugs and surfactants owing to its chiral center and rigid molecular structure [18–22]. For example, incorporation of isosorbide monomer as additive could greatly enhance the strength and rigidity of the polymer (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) [19,20]. Hence, the conversion of sorbitol to isosorbide has attracted much interest. Isosorbide can be obtained by sequential intramolecular dehydration of sorbitol. [23,24] The reaction has been studied early with liquid mineral acids as catalysts. [24] However, several drawbacks exist including equipment corrosion, environmental pollution, and the high costs of separation. For both economic and environmental reasons, a number of solid acid catalysts were developed for catalytic dehydration of sorbitol [25–35], such as supported heteropolyacids (HPAs), acid resins, zeolites, cellulose-derived solid acid, and acid-functionalized SBA-15. For example, Sun and coworkers reported that 56% isosorbide selectivity could be obtained with a 95% sorbitol conversion under the temperature of 250 °C using 30% H3PW12O40/SiO2 catalyst, [33] Cai et al. studied the dehydration of sorbitol over a cellulose-derived solid acid and the isosorbide selectivity could be achieved 67% with 100% conversion of sorbitol at 200 °C for 1 h. [35] Though great progresses have been made, longer reaction time or higher reaction temperature was often required over solid acid catalyst compared with liquid mineral acid catalysts. Therefore, it remains desirable to develop efficient solid acid catalysts for dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide under milder reaction conditions. HPAs of Keggin type exhibited excellent catalytic activities in acid-catalyzed reactions such as esterification, hydrolysis, isomerization, alkylation and hydration, because of strong Brönsted acidity. [36,37] However, they were often used as homogeneous catalysts. Interestingly, the exchange H+ of HPAs with different cations of large ionic radius (e.g., NH4 +, Cs+, Ag+) could form insoluble salts and tune the property of HPAs by partial or total substitution. They exhibited high catalytic activities in different reactions. [38–48] For example, Wang and coworkers described catalytic conversion of fructose into 5-hydroymethylfurfural (HMF) by using a solid heteropolyacid Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalyst. [46] Zhu et al. reported that partially silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid presented high selectivity for glycerol esterification with acetic acid to the desired diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol with a combined selectivity of 90.7%. [48] However, catalytic dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide over heterogeneous phosphotungstic acid catalysts was largely ignored. Inspired by those reports mentioned above, [36,39–48] herein we prepared a series of silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid (HPW) as solid catalysts, and studied efficient catalytic dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide under solvent-free reaction conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials D-sorbitol (98%, AR) and H3PW12O40·xH2O (AR) were purchased from Macklin Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Silver nitrate solution (0.1 mol/L) and acetonitrile (≥99.9%, HPLC) were supplied by Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Isosorbide (98%), 1,4-sorbitan (98%) and 1,5-sorbitan were obtained from J&K Scientific Ltd.. All the chemicals in this work, unless stated otherwise, were used without any further purification. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The water content of H3PW12O4·xH2O was measured by TG method. According to previous literatures, the Ag-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts were prepared by an ion-exchanged process. [47,48] Typically, 5.0 g HPW was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water at room temperature. Under continuous stirring, different amounts of AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.1 mol/L) were added dropwise to the above solutions respectively at room temperature. AgxH3-xPW12O40 with different metal contents could therefore be properly adjusted. The resulting mixture was aged for 2 h, and then the water was removed by evaporation in a rotary evaporator. Finally, the remaining solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 300 °C for 4 h. These as-prepared catalysts were denoted as Ag1H2PW, Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW, according to the following equations: xAgNO3 + H3PW12O40 → AgxH3-xPW12O40 + xHNO3 (x = 1, 2, 3) Cs-exchanged and NH4 +-exchanged HPW catalysts were also prepared by the reported procedures. [49,50] H3PW12O40, H4SiW12O40 and H3PMo12O40 were calcined at 300 °C for 4 h before used as catalysts for the dehydration of sorbitol. 2.3 Catalyst characterization FT-IR spectra were collected on a Nicolet iN10 MX & iS10 FT-IR spectrometer in the wave number range of 650–4000 cm−1, using a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. Prior to measurement, the investigated samples were mixed with powdered potassium bromide and then pressed into a disc. In order to explore the acid types of the catalysts, infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption (Py-IR) were also obtained using the same spectrometer as above. The samples were pretreated under vacuum condition at 250 °C for 1 h to remove adsorbed impurities. After cooling down to room temperature, pyridine adsorption was performed, and the spectra were recorded at 200 °C after vacuum condition. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were characterized by a Shimadzu XRD-7000S diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source in the 2θ range of 5–90° operating at 40 kV and 30 mA with a scan rate of 5°/min. Raman spectroscopy (inVia, Renishaw) was employed to check the structure of the samples operating at 532 nm with a power of 50 MW. NH3-TPD was carried out to estimate the acidity of the catalysts using a ChemStar 3000 equipment (Quantachrome, USA). The catalyst was pretreated in flowing He for 1 h at 250 °C and then cooled to 50 °C. Adsorption of NH3 was performed by a stream of 5.62% NH3-He using pulse model until saturation. After being purged with He for 30 min, desorption of NH3 was performed by heating the catalyst to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer with quartz cells at 298 K in the wavelength range of 200–400 nm. 2.4 Typical procedure for the dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide The dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide was carried out under solvent-free reactions in a three-necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a water segregator and a reflux condenser, which were attached to a vacuum pump. The diagram of the reaction apparatus is shown in Fig. S1. In a typical procedure, sorbitol (5 g) was heated to 140 °C in an oil bath and melted in the open air. Afterwards, the catalyst (0.3 g) was added to the liquid sorbitol with magnetically stirred at 800 rmp/min, and the reaction was kept for 1 h under vacuum conditions. 2.5 Products analysis After the reaction, the flask was cooled to room temperature and then acetonitrile/water (85/15, v/v) were added to the flask to extract the products and remaining sorbitol. The liquid mixture was separated from the catalyst by centrifugation and filtration using the membrane filter. The liquid solution was analyzed using HPLC (Shimadzu, LC-20AD) equipped with refractive index detector (Shimadzu, RID-20 A) and CAPCELL PAK NH2 UG80S5 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm). The temperature of column was set at 40 °C and acetonitrile/water (85/15, v/v) mixture was used as a mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The main products were identified by comparing the retention time with respective standards in LC traces. The amounts of products were determined based on LC data using external standard method. To confirm the reproducibility of the experiment, some key experiments were repeated at least two times and the deviation was below 5%. The conversion of sorbitol and selectivity of products were calculated according to the following equations: C o n v e r s i o n % = m o l e s o f r e a c t e d s o r b i t o l m o l e s o f i n i t i a l s o r b i t o l × 100 % S e l e c t i v i t y % = m o l e s o f o n e p r o d u c t m o l e s o f r e a c t e d s o r b i t o l × 100 % 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization 3.1.1 FT-IR, Raman spectra and XRD patterns of the catalysts In order to compare the structure of Ag-salts and bulk phosphotungstic acid (HPW), FT-IR, Raman and XRD characterization was performed (Supporting information, Fig S2-S5). All of the above results suggest the presence and integrity of the Keggin structure in the synthesized Ag1H2PW, Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW catalysts and bulk HPW. These results are in line with the previous reports. [47–59] 3.1.2 NH3-TPD patterns of the catalysts The nature of the acid sites usually has an important influence on acid-catalyzed reactions. NH3-TPD was performed to quantitatively determine the acid strength and acid amount of the bulk HPW and Ag-salts catalysts. The background was collected for the catalyst using pure He to substitute NH3-He mixture with the same procedure, which could avoid the disturbance of the Keggin anions decomposition. [33] After subtracting the background curves, the NH3-TPD curves were obtained (Fig. 1 ). By calculating the desorbed ammonia based on integrating the TPD curves, the acid amount could be measured quantitatively (Table S1). There are three types of desorption peaks investigated in the range of 50–650 °C. The peaks in the range of 500–650 °C are related to the chemisorbed NH3 on strong acid sites, and the peaks in the range of 300–450 °C and below 250 °C are ascribed to moderate and weak acid sites, respectively. [55,60–62] The bulk HPW and Ag-salts catalysts all show desorption peaks at both high-temperature (500–650 °C) and low-temperature (below 250 °C) (Fig. 1). However, with increasing Ag/P ratio from 0 to 3, the intensity of the high-temperature desorption peaks (500–650 °C) decreases and there is obvious shift towards lower temperature for the high-temperature desorption peak (500–650 °C). On the contrary, the intensity of the desorption peaks corresponding to moderate-temperature (300–450 °C) and low-temperature (below 250 °C) increased, meanwhile the desorption peaks shift towards higher temperature increasing Ag/P ratio from 1 to 3. These changes indicate that the amount and strength related to strong acid sites obviously decrease, and those of weak acid sites increase with the formation of moderate acid sites by increasing Ag/P ratio from 1 to 3. 3.1.3 Py-IR spectra of the catalysts In order to further understand the acid types of catalysts, FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption were recorded to investigate the Brönsted and Lewis acid sites of the catalysts (Fig. 2 ). The spectra present various characteristic bands in the range of 1420-1580 cm−1. The characteristic band centered at 1540 cm−1 is attributed to the adsorption of pyridine on the Brönsted acid sites. The peak observed at the range of 1445–1465 cm−1 is related to pyridine adsorption on the Lewis acid sites. The band appearing at 1485 cm−1 is a combined band due to the adsorption of pyridine on both the Brönsted and Lewis acid sites. [55,63] Bulk HPW and Ag-salts of HPW all exhibit the bands around both 1540 cm−1 and 1485 cm−1, but the intensity of the bands decreases with the increases of Ag content (Fig. 2). The bands at 1445-1465 cm−1 arise and the intensity increases with increasing Ag content. These results indicate that the amount of Brönsted acid sites reduce significantly while the new Lewis acid sites appear and the amount of them increase with increasing the Ag content, which are in accordance with the results of NH3-TPD. 3.2 Catalytic dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide 3.2.1 Effect of various Ag contents on sorbitol dehydration The catalytic dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide over Ag-salts of HPW was carried out under solvent-free conditions, and the system was kept in vacuum in order to remove water. Table 1 shows the results over different Ag-salts catalysts at 140 °C in 1 h. No 1,4-sorbitan and isosorbide were detected with only 4% conversion of sorbitol, which indicated that the acid catalyst was indispensible for the production of isosorbide (Table 1, entry 1). As expected, HPW presented high catalytic activity with 87% selectivity of isosorbide, however, it was completely dissolved in the reaction system (Table 1, entry 2). To our delight, more than 99% conversion of sorbitol was obtained with 83% selectivity of isosorbide in the presence of Ag1H2PW under the same reaction conditions. Besides isosorbide, 11% selectivity of 1,4-sorbtian was also observed as well as 6% other byproducts including some polymeric compounds, [23] 1,5-sorbitan and 2,5-sorbitan. This result is comparable with that using a homogeneous phosphotungstic acid (HPW) catalyst (Table 1, entries 2 and 3), and Ag2H1PW catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture, which seems a competitive solid catalyst with supported heteropolyacid like H3PW12O40/SiO2 catalyst. [33] The selectivity of isosorbide decreased from 83% to 16% with increasing the Ag/P from 1 to 2 (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). The conversion of sorbitol was only 8% and no 1,4-sorbitan and isosorbide was detected when Ag3PW was employed (Table 1, entry 5).The results indicated that the catalytic activity of Ag-salts of HPW decreased in the following order of Ag1H2PW, Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW. It could be ascribed to the acidic properties of Ag-salts catalysts, since Ag1H2PW and HPW exhibited the stronger acidity and greater amount of Brönsted acid sites compared to Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW, as described above. The acid strength and amount of Brönsted acid matched well with the results of the catalytic dehydration of sorbitol. The catalyst with more strong acid sites and Brönsted acid sites are more efficient for the dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide under moderate reaction conditions. 3.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature Fig. 3 shows the results of catalytic dehydration of sorbitol over Ag1H2PW and Ag2H1PW catalysts at different reaction temperatures. Almost complete conversion of sorbitol could be achieved with Ag1H2PW catalyst at 130 °C within 1 h, however, the selectivity of isosorbide was only 26%. An obvious increase of isosorbide selectivity could be observed when the reaction temperature rise from 130 °C to 140 °C, and the selectivity of 1,4-sorbitan was decreased significantly (Fig. 3a). It indicated that 1,4-sorbitan as an intermediate could be transformed into isosorbide, and the dehydration of 1,4-sorbitan to isosorbide required higher temperature compared to sorbitol dehydration to 1,4-sorbitan. The isosorbide selectivity slightly decreased with an increase of other by-products selectivity when reaction temperature was further increased from 140 °C to 150 °C. Therefore, the optimal temperature for isosorbide selectivity was around 140 °C with Ag1H2PW catalyst. Compared with Ag1H2PW, the selectivity of isosorbide could be achieved around 80% over Ag2H1PW catalyst at least 160 °C rather than 140 °C (Fig. 3b). The Ag2H1PW catalyst possesses weak acidity and less amount of Brönsted acid sites than Ag1H2PW, and higher temperature was required to achieve similar results. The catalyst with stronger acidity and higher amount of Brönsted acid sites led to higher selectivity of isosorbide under the same reactions. 3.2.3 Effect of reaction time The effect of reaction time on the dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide was investigated using Ag1H2PW catalyst (Fig. 4 ). Nearly 100% conversion of sorbitol could be achieved within 20 min at 140 °C, however, more than 70% selectivity of 1,4-sorbitan was obtained as the main product rather than isosorbide in the initial reaction stage. When the reaction time was prolonged, the 1,4-sorbitan selectivity decreased gradually along with the increasing selectivity of isosorbide. Up to 83% selectivity isosorbide could be attained within 60 min. These results suggest that 1,4-sorbitan is one of the key intermediate in the dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide, and further dehydration of 1,4-sorbitan into isosorbide proceeds much slower after fast dehydration of sorbitol to 1,4-sorbitan. 3.2.4 Comparison with other polyoxometallates Some other heteropolyacids or insoluble polyoxometallates were also used for catalytic dehydration of sorbitol under the same reaction conditions (Table 2 ). H3PMo12O40 present much lower activity for sorbitol dehydration with 50% sorbitol conversion and no isosorbide was observed (Table 2, entry 1). More 99% conversion was obtained when H4SiW12O40 was employed, however the selectivity of isosorbide was lower than that of H3PW12O40 (Table 2, entry 2, and Table 1, entry 2). These difference might be related to the acid strength of the heteropolyacids which increased in the order of H3PW12O40>H4SiW12O40>H3PMo12O40. [36] Other insoluble polyoxometallates such as Cs1H2PW and (NH4)1H2PW could also promote the dehydration of sorbitol, however, lower selectivity of isosorbide was obtained compared to that using Ag1H2PW catalyst (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). These results indicated that the investigated Ag1H2PW catalyst possessed extremely high activity for the dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide. 3.3 Proposed reaction pathways for dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide Based on the results mentioned above, the reaction pathways of sorbitol dehydration over Ag1H2PW catalyst were displayed in Scheme 1 . The dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide involves at least two sequential steps. Firstly sorbitol was facilely converted into 1,4-sorbitan as a key intermediate, and then isosorbide could be produced via the further dehydration of 1,4-sorbitan, which proceed much slower than formation of 1,4-sorbitan. The stronger acidity and higher amount of Brönsted acid sites were preferred for these sequential steps, and the similar pathways of sorbitol dehydration were also described by the previous reports. [21,23] 3.4 Catalyst reusability The reusability of the Ag1H2PW catalyst was also performed for the dehydration of sorbitol. Different treatments have been used for Ag1H2PW after reaction including the direct use of the spent samples and the regeneration by heat treatment in HNO3 solutions. The results of recycling tests were shown in Fig. 5 . Direct reuse of Ag1H2PW catalyst (Fig. 5, Ag1-spent 1) gave lower catalytic activity for the conversion of sorbitol and selectivity of isosorbide than that of the fresh Ag1H2PW (Fig. 5, Ag1-fresh). Interestingly, after regeneration using HNO3 solutions, similar conversion of sorbitol and selectivity of isosorbide could be achieved with the regenerated Ag1H2PW, and the catalyst could be reused three times without obvious loss of the catalytic activity. The catalyst after three cycles displayed similar FT-IR spectra compared to the fresh Ag1H2PW catalyst (Fig. S5, lines Ag1-fresh and Ag1-reg.3). The regenerated samples were also characterized by NH3-TPD (Fig. S6 and Table S2), and showed similar acidic property in comparing with the fresh Ag1H2PW. In order to check the leaching [PW12O40]3−, the reaction mixture was diluted with a 85/15 (v/v) acetonitrile/water solvent mixture by twenty fold, and then the corresponding liquid solution was examined by UV–vis spectroscopy (Fig. S7). The leaching [PW12O40]3− of reaction mixture catalyzed by Ag1H2PW could be neglected compared to that of HPW. The liquid reaction mixture after the first reaction was further determined by ICP-MS to confirm whether there was leaching of silver ion. The concentration of silver was only 0.585 mg/L, which indicated that the amounts of leaching of silver ion in the dehydration process were very small (0.43%). All above results of characterizations and reactions indicated that the Ag1H2PW could be easily regenerated by 65% HNO3 solutions and repeatedly used without obvious loss of catalytic performance. 4 Conclusions We have developed Ag-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts for the dehydration of sorbitol under solvent-free reaction conditions. Around 83% isosorbide selectivity and more than 99% conversion of sorbitol were obtained using Ag1H2PW catalyst at 140 °C within 1 h. Ag1H2PW could be easily regenerated by 65% HNO3 solutions and reused at least 3 times without obvious loss of catalytic activity. Ag1H2PW displayed best activity among Ag1H3-xP12W40 (x = 1, 2, 3) under the same reaction conditions, which related to the stronger acidity and higher amount of Brönsted acid sites of Ag1H2PW. The report may be helpful for further development of efficient solid acid catalyst for biomass conversion.

        "dc:description": "Transformation of renewable biomass into chemicals has attracted much attention recently. Efficient catalytic dehydration of biomass-derived sorbitol into isosorbide over solid acid catalysts under moderate reaction conditions is still a technical challenge. A series of silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts were prepared by an ion-exchanged process, and dehydration of sorbitol into isosorbide was performed under solvent-free conditions. More than 99% conversion of sorbitol was obtained with 83% selectivity of isosorbide over Ag1H2PW catalyst at 140 °C within 1 h, which are comparable with that using a homogeneous phosphotungstic acid (HPW) catalyst. The silver-exchanged phosphotungstic acid catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, Raman, NH3-TPD and Py-IR to build a relationship between the catalytic activity and their natures. Ag1H2PW exhibited much higher activity for catalytic dehydration of sorbitol to isosorbide compared with Ag2H1PW and Ag3PW under the same reaction conditions, which was attributed to the stronger acidity and higher amount of Brönsted acid sites. Moreover, Ag1H2PW could be easily regenerated by 65% HNO3 solutions and used repeatedly at least 3 times without obvious loss of catalytic activity.",
