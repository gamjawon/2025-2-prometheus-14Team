It was found that the addition of alkali metal ions to the Fe catalyst led to significant increases in both the CO2 conversion and the selectivity for olefins. Over Kâ€� or Rbâ€�modified catalysts, about 40% CO2 conversion and more than 50% olefin selectivity were obtained. The yield of C2â€“C4 olefins exceeded 10% over these modified catalysts. Catalyst characterization suggested that the formation of iron carbide species was accelerated by the modification of the Fe catalyst with alkali metal ions, and this enhancement may be one of the key reasons for the enhanced catalytic performance. For the Kâ€�modified Fe catalysts, K content has a major influence on the catalyst behavior. An increase in the K content from 1 to 5 wt% increased both CO2 conversion and olefin selectivity. However, too high a K content led to a decrease in the activity, probably because of decreases in the surface area and CO2 chemisorption capacity of the catalyst. The presence of an appropriate amount of B in the Kâ€�modified Fe catalyst was found to be beneficial to the olefin selectivity, without significantly deâ€� creasing the conversion of CO2.

Introduction The use of CO2 as a carbon resource for the production of fuels and chemicals not only contributes to the alleviation of global climate changes caused by growing CO2 emissions, but also provides an attractive approach to reducing dependence on fossil fuel resources. Recently, many studies have been deâ€� voted to the catalytic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates [1â€“8]. One promising route for the use of CO2 is the selective production of light olefins by the hydrogenation of CO2 with H2 [9]. Generally, the hydrogenation of CO2 by H2 to hydrocarbons proceeds via two steps, i.e., the reduction of CO2 to CO via the reverse waterâ€�gas shift (RWGS) reaction and subâ€� sequent CO hydrogenation, which is known as Fischerâ€�Tropsch (FT) synthesis [10â€“12]. As efficient catalysts for both the RWGS reaction and FT synthesis [13,14], Feâ€�based catalysts have reâ€� ceived much attention for the hydrogenation of CO2 [15â€“20]. However, Fe catalysts alone are not suitable for FT synthesis as they produce undesired CH4 as the main product, and rapid deactivation of the catalysts also occurs easily [13,14]. Many studies have therefore focused on supported Fe catalysts modiâ€� fied with electronic and/or structural promoters to enhance the catalytic activity and product selectivity. For example, a Kâ€�modified Fe/Al2O3 catalyst has been reported to provide CO2 conversion of 69% and a C2âˆ’C4 olefin selectivity of 40%, with CH4 selectivity of less than 20%, at 673 K [15].

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 YOU Zhenya et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 956â€“963 e.g., Ce, Mn, and Cu, could also be used as promoters for Fe/Al2O3 or Fe/silicateâ€�2 catalysts, which enhanced both CO2 conversion and C2+ olefin selectivity [16â€“20]. To date, studies of nonâ€�supported Fe catalysts are scarce [21]. Fe is a relatively cheap metal, and it can be used as an industrial catalyst without a support. To simplify the catalytic system and to gain more straightforward information on the effects of promoters without the complication of the â€œsupport effectâ€�, we performed the hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins over nonâ€�supported Fe catalysts. In the present paper, we report the effects of the modification of Fe catalysts with alkali metal ions on the catalyst structure and catalytic performance. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The nonâ€�supported Fe catalyst was prepared by calcining ammonium ferric citrate, i.e., Fe(NH4)3(C6H5O7)2, at 773 K for 5 h. The alkaliâ€�metalâ€�ionâ€�promoted Fe catalysts were prepared using ammonium ferric citrate and alkali metal nitrates as preâ€� cursors. In brief, the required amounts of ammonium ferric citrate and alkali metal nitrate were dissolved in deionized water and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 6 h. Waâ€� ter was then evaporated from the mixed aqueous solution at 353 K with continuous stirring. The dried sample was calcined at 773 K in air for 5 h. Bâ€�modified catalysts were prepared usâ€� ing the same procedure, except for the addition of boric acid (H3BO3) to the mixed aqueous solution of alkali metal nitrate and ammonium ferric citrate. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Powder Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded usâ€� ing a Rigaku Altima IV diffractometer with Cu KÎ± ï€ ï€ radiation (35 kV, 15 mA). The specific surface area of catalysts was measured by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 instruâ€� ment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a Tecnai F30 microscope at a voltage of 200 kV for all catalysts. The mean size of Fe (or iron oxide) particles was estimated from the TEM micrographs by counting ca. 100â€“200 particles. Xâ€�ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with a Quantum 2000 Scanâ€� ning ESCA Microprobe instrument using Al KÎ± radiation. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.8 eV as a reference. CO2 chemisorption measurements were performed at 323 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The sample (0.10 g) used for the chemisorption study was reduced at 673 K in an H2 gas flow, followed by evacuation at the reduction temperaâ€� ture and then cooling to 323 K. The difference between the adsorption isotherms obtained by repeated use of a gas dosing and degassing system provided the amount of CO2 chemiâ€� sorbed on the catalyst. 2.3. Catalytic reaction The hydrogenation of CO2 was performed on a fixedâ€�bed highâ€�pressure stainlessâ€�steel reactor. The catalyst loaded in the reactor was first pretreated in an H2 gas flow (50 ml/min) at 673 K for 5 h prior to reaction. After the reactor was cooled to 353 K, a mixture of H2/CO2/Ar with a molar ratio composition of 69/23/8 was introduced into the reactor. The pressure was typically regulated to 2.0 MPa. The reaction was started by raising the temperature to the desired reaction temperature (typically 613 K). The products were analyzed using gas chroâ€� matography, and the results after 10 h of reaction were typiâ€� cally used for discussion. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic performance of nonâ€�supported Fe catalysts Table 1 shows the catalytic performance of Fe and alkaâ€� liâ€�metalâ€�ionâ€�modified Fe catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2. The Fe catalyst without modification exhibited very low activity and gave a CO2 conversion of only 5.6% at 613 K. CH4 and light (C2âˆ’C4) paraffins were the predominant products and no oleâ€� fins were formed over the unmodified Fe catalyst. The modifiâ€� cation of the Fe catalyst with an alkali metal ion significantly enhanced the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation. For example, the CO2 conversion using an Li + â€�modified Fe catalyst was four times higher than that achieved using the unmodified catalyst. The selectivity for CH4 decreased significantly from 62% to 29%, and olefins were formed with a selectivity of about 35% in the hydrocarbon products. Over K + â€� or Rb + â€�modified Fe catalysts, the conversion of CO2 and the olefin selectivity further increased to about 40% and 50%, respecâ€� tively. The yield of light (C2âˆ’C4) olefins reached 10%â€“12%. The alkali metal ion therefore not only greatly promoted the conâ€� Table 1 Effects of various alkali metal ion modifiers on catalytic performance of Fe catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2.

YOU Zhenya et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 956â€“963 version of CO2 but also significantly changed the product disâ€� tributions in the hydrogenation of CO2. The selectivities for CH4 and C2âˆ’C4 paraffins were suppressed, whereas olefin selectiviâ€� ty, particularly C2âˆ’C4 olefins, was significantly enhanced. The yield of C2âˆ’C4 olefins increased in the following order: Fe < Li + â€�modified Fe < Na + â€�modified Fe < Cs + â€�modified Fe < K + â€�modified Fe < Rb + â€�modified Fe. In other words, a catalyst modified with an alkali metal ion with a stronger basicity exâ€� hibits a more significant promoting effect for the hydrogenaâ€� tion of CO2 to light olefins, except for the Cs + â€�modified catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonâ€� strate that considerable C2âˆ’C4 olefin yields can be achieved by simply modifying an Fe catalyst with an alkali metal ion. Although the Rb + â€�modified catalyst gave the best yield of C2âˆ’C4 olefins, the K + â€�modified Fe catalyst was also efficient and was much cheaper than the Rb + â€�modified catalyst. We thereâ€� fore further investigated the effect of the K content on the cataâ€� lytic performance of the K + â€�modified Fe catalysts for the hyâ€� drogenation of CO2. Table 2 shows that, with increasing K conâ€� tent up to 5 wt%, the conversion of CO2 and the olefin selectivâ€� ity increased rapidly, and the CH4 selectivity decreased sharply. The highest C2âˆ’C4 olefin yield was achieved over the catalyst with a K content of 5â€“10 wt%. Further increases in the K conâ€� tent led to decreases in the conversion of CO2 and yield of C2âˆ’C4 olefins. An appropriate K/Fe ratio was required to obtain high olefin yields from CO2 hydrogenation. We found that the catalytic performance, particularly the C2âˆ’C4 olefin selectivity, could be further promoted to some extent by Bâ€�doping of the Fe catalyst modified with 5 wt% K + . As shown in Table 3, the addition of a small amount of B (â‰¤1.0 wt%) to the 5â€�wt%â€�K + â€�modified Fe catalyst did not change, or slightly increased, the conversion of CO2. However, as the conâ€� tent of B increased to â‰¥3 wt%, significant decreases in CO2 conversion were observed. The interesting point is that modiâ€� fication with B can modify the product distribution. In particuâ€� lar, with increasing B content from 0.5 wt% to 5.0 wt%, the selectivity for C2â€“C4 olefins increased from 34% to 52%. The C2âˆ’C4 olefin selectivity and yield were 40% and 12%, respecâ€� tively, over the 1.0 wt% Bâˆ’5.0 wt% K + âˆ’Fe catalyst. However, when the content of B rose to â‰¥3.0%, the CO selectivity inâ€� creased from <10% to 19%â€“28%, and that for hydrocarbons decreased to 65%â€“75%. Because of this and the decrease in CO2 conversion, catalysts with higher B contents (>1 wt%) did not give higher yields of C2âˆ’C4 olefins. In spite of this, modificaâ€� tion with an appropriate amount of B (1.0â€“5.0 wt%) decreased the selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons and increased that for C2âˆ’C4 olefins, without increasing that for CH4. 3.2. Characterization of nonâ€�supported Fe catalysts Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Fe catalysts with and without alkali metal ion modifications. Analyses of the diffracâ€� tion patterns in Fig. 1(a) reveal that magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3) coâ€�exist in all of the fresh catalysts. The relaâ€� tively strong intensities of the XRD peaks ascribed to Fe3O4 suggest that Fe3O4 is the main crystalline phase in all the alkaâ€� liâ€�metalâ€�ionâ€�modified Fe catalysts. The diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 for the unmodified Fe catalyst were narrower and sharper than those for the Fe catalysts modified with alkali metal ions (Fig. 1(a)). This indicates decreases in the sizes of the Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 crystallites after modification with alkali metal ions. We calculated the size of the Fe3O4 crystallites from the Scherrer equation using the (311) facet of Fe3O4. The reâ€� sults showed that the size of the Fe3O4 crystallites in the 5â€�wt%â€�K + â€�modified Fe catalyst was about 17 nm, smaller than that (27 nm) in the unmodified Fe catalyst. No diffraction peaks corresponding to alkali metal compounds were detected in the XRD patterns. It is probable that the alkali metal ions are highly Table 2 Catalytic performance of K + â€�modified Fe catalysts with different K contents for hydrogenation of CO2.

After reductive treatment in H2 at 673 K, a key step for cataâ€� lyst activation, all of the samples displayed diffraction peaks at 2ï�±ï€ ï€ values ofï€ 44.7Â° and 65.0Â°, which could be ascribed to crysâ€� talline Î±â€�Fe. The stronger intensity of the XRD peak at a 2ï�±ï€ ï€ value ofï€ 44.7Â° suggests that Î±â€�Fe is the major phase in all the catalysts (Fig. 1(b)). This indicates that a large part of the Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 in the fresh catalysts has been reduced to Î±â€�Fe after reduction in H2 at 673 K. However, some Fe3O4 was still detectable in the reductively treated catalysts. After catalytic reaction for 10 h, Fe3O4 became the major crystalline phase in all the catalysts (Fig. 1(c)). Moreover, new diffraction peaks at 2ï�±ï€ ï€ values ofï€ 44.2Â° and 43.4Â° were observed in the alkaliâ€�metalâ€�ionâ€�modified Fe catalysts. However, these peaks were not clearly observed in the used unmodified Fe catalyst. These peaks could be assigned to the (021) and (510) reflections of crystalline Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 [22]. This observation suggests that the alkali metal ions accelerate generation of the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase in the catalysts after reaction. The XRD patterns of K + â€�modified Fe catalysts with different K contents are displayed in Fig. 2. Only iron oxide (i.e., Fe3O4 and Fe2O3) phases were observed for all the fresh catalysts (Fig. 2(a)). No diffraction peaks of Kâ€�related compounds were deâ€� tected using XRD, even for the catalyst with a very high K conâ€� tent (32 wt%). Figure 2(b) shows that the content of K exerts little influence on the reduction of iron oxides to Î±â€�Fe. After the catalytic reaction at 613 K, the diffraction peaks attributed to the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase appeared in all the Kâ€�modified Fe catalysts with different K contents (Fig. 2(c)). This is further evidence that K promotes formation of iron carbide species. A weak difâ€� fraction peak attributable to K2O was observed for the catalyst with a K content of 32 wt% (Fig. 2(c), curve (7)), and the intenâ€� sities of the diffraction peaks of Fe3O4 decreased when the conâ€� tent of K increased to 32 wt%.

YOU Zhenya et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 956â€“963 changed the XRD pattern. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the diffracâ€� tion peaks ascribed to iron oxides were broadened by the presence of B in the K + â€�modified Fe catalyst. Moreover, the hematite (Fe2O3) phase in the fresh catalyst disappeared imâ€� mediately after the introduction of B into the K + â€�modified Fe catalyst, and only the magnetite (Fe3O4) phase was detectable by XRD (Fig. 3(a)). Figure 3(b) shows that the ratio of the inâ€� tensity of the strongest diffraction peak of ï�¡â€�Fe to that of Fe3O4 decreases with increasing B content, implying that the reducâ€� tion of Fe3O4 in a H2 flow at 673 K becomes more difficult in the presence of a B modifier. After the catalytic reactions, the forâ€� mation of the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase in the Bâ€�modified samples was still clearly observed although the intensities of all the diffraction peaks were weaker (Fig. 3(c)). Further investigations revealed that the surface area and the amount of CO2 chemisorption changed after modification of the Fe catalyst with K + and/or B. As shown in Table 4, although no support was used in our study, a specific surface area of 54 m 2 /g was attained for the nonâ€�modified Fe catalyst prepared by calcination of ammonium ferric citrate. Compared with the conventional precipitation method or the microemulsion techâ€� nique for the preparation of Fe catalysts [21], this simple proâ€� cedure is an effective way of obtaining nonâ€�supported Fe mateâ€� rials with relatively high surface area. After the addition of a low amount of K + (1â€“5 wt%), the surface area of the catalyst is larger than that of the unmodified Fe catalyst. We speculate that a lower content of alkali metal ions may help to disperse iron oxides, thus avoiding the growth of iron oxide particles during calcination. This was supported by calculation of the crystallite size of Fe3O4 from the XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a). Furâ€� thermore, the TEM images shown in Fig. 4 confirm that the mean size of iron oxide particles decreased from 30.9 nm to 11.1 nm as a result of modification with K + . However, too high a K content led to a decrease in the surface area (Table 4). Reâ€� cently, Dorner et al. [23] reported that K species could form a monomer layer on Fe surfaces when 8 wt% K was loaded on a 17 wt% Feâ€�Mn/Al2O3 catalyst. Although Al2O3 was used as the support in their case, the K + was still found to cover the Fe surâ€� face preferentially. It is also interesting that the addition of B to the 5â€�wt%â€�Kâ€�modified Fe catalyst significantly increased the surface area. The surface area rose to about 120 m 2 /g with increasing B content to 3 wt%. A further increase in the B conâ€� tent did not change the surface area significantly. The mean size of the iron oxide particles in the 1 wt% Bâ€�5 wt% Kâ€�modified Fe catalyst was 11.0 nm (Fig. 4). Table 4 also shows that the amount of CO2 chemisorption is significantly enhanced by the addition of 5â€“10 wt% K + to the Fe catalyst. The degree of increase in the amount of CO2 chemiâ€� sorption for the 5 wt% K + â€�modified catalyst was larger than that in the surface area. This is believed to be caused by inâ€� creased surface basicity as a result of the introduction of K + in the catalyst. With further increases in the K + content, the amount of CO2 chemisorption decreased, probably because of a decrease in the surface area. For the Bâ€�Kâ€�Fe series of catalysts, the amount of CO2 chemisorption decreased with increasing B content. Generally, B has an acidic character, and thus the baâ€� sicity of the 5â€�wt%â€�K + â€�modified catalyst decreased on addition of acidic B. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra of the Fe catalysts modified with different amounts of K and B.

We calcuâ€� lated the K/Fe atomic ratios for the Kâ€�Fe catalysts using the XPS results (Table 5). Over the catalysts with 5â€“16 wt% K, the surâ€� face and bulk K/Fe ratios were very close. However, as the K content increased to 32 wt%, the K/Fe ratio on the surface reached 2.0 and became significantly larger than that in the bulk (0.67). This indicates that the catalyst surface is covered by excess K2O; this is in agreement with the XRD observations (Fig. 2). It is also clear that the introduction of B into the Kâ€�Fe cataâ€� lyst does not change the oxidation states of K and Fe (Fig. 5). The peak at a binding energy of 191.8 eV, for B 1s, which is asâ€� signable to B2O3 [24], can be detected for all the Bâ€�doped cataâ€� lysts.

Roles of K and B modifications The modification of the Fe catalyst with an appropriate amount of K + significantly enhanced the conversion of CO2 (Taâ€� bles 1 and 2). The selectivity for CO decreased, and that for hydrocarbons and organic oxygenates increased. This implies that not only the activation and conversion of CO2 but also the subsequent conversion of CO to hydrocarbons and organic oxygenates was accelerated by the modification with K + and other alkali metal ions because the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons is believed to involve two steps, i.e., the RWGS reaction and subsequent CO hydrogenation. The enhanced CO2 chemisorption as a result of the presence of K + may be one of the reasons for the increase in the conversion of CO2. It is also possible that the adsorption of CO2 on Kâ€�, Rbâ€�, or Csâ€�modified Fe catalysts with stronger basicities is easier than that on Liâ€� or Naâ€�modified Fe catalysts, and thus the first set of catalysts gave higher CO2 conversions. However, it is well known that K + promotes activity in CO hydrogenation, i.e., FT synthesis [13]. Many studies have proâ€� posed an electronic promoting effect of K + [13]. The K may weaken the bonds of CO adsorbed on Fe by increasing the elecâ€� tronic density of Fe particles, which can then be backâ€�donated to the antiâ€�bonding orbital of CO, leading to increased dissociaâ€� tion of CO. Strongly basic alkali metal ions, including K + , Rb + and Cs + , may therefore function as electronic promoters for the enhancement of CO conversion; this is supported by the lower selectivity for CO over these modified catalysts (Table 1). Our XRD results suggest that modification with K + enhances generation of the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase during the reaction (Figs. 1 and 2). Many studies have proposed that the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase is the active phase for FT synthesis over Feâ€�based catalysts [22,25,26]. Although the magnetite (Fe3O4) phase, which was previously suggested to be the active phase in FT synthesis [14], was observed in all the catalysts, the low activity of the nonâ€�modified Fe catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation (Table 1) alâ€� lowed us to exclude the possibility of Fe3O4 as the active phase. We therefore speculate that K + and other alkali metals accelerâ€� ate CO conversion by accelerating formation of the Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 phase. Furthermore, the product distribution in the hydrocarbon products was changed significantly by modification with K + or other alkali metal ions (Tables 1 and 2). The significant deâ€� creases in the selectivities for CH4 and C2âˆ’C4 paraffins, and the increases in those for C2âˆ’C4 olefins and C5+ hydrocarbons (parâ€� ticularly C5+ olefins), clearly indicate that the hydrogenation ability decreases and the chainâ€�growth ability increases in the presence of K + or other alkali metal ion modifiers. We speculate that the enhanced CO adsorption and dissociation ability in the presence of K + may lower the adsorption of H2 on the catalyst surface and thus decrease the hydrogenation ability. Concerning the role of B, the addition of a small amount of B to the 5â€�wt%â€�K + â€�modified Fe catalyst slightly increased the conversion of CO2, possibly because of the increased specific surface area. However, when the content of B became â‰¥3 wt%, decreases in CO2 conversion were observed (Table 3). We speculate that this is caused by a decrease in the amount of CO2 chemisorption (Table 4) as a result of the acidic character of B. It is interesting that modification of the 5â€�wt%â€�K + â€�modified Fe catalyst with B significantly suppressed the formation of C5+ hydrocarbons, but the selectivity for CH4 was not enhanced (Table 3). For example, the selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons decreased from 30% to 19%, whereas that for C2âˆ’C4 olefins increased from 34% to 40% after the addition of 1.0 wt% B to the 5 wt% Kâ€�Fe catalyst. The selectivity for C2âˆ’C4 olefins furâ€� ther increased to 52% when the B content was increased to 3 wt%, but the CO2 conversion decreased. In an early work, Li et al. [27] observed that the products shifted to lowâ€� erâ€�molecularâ€�weight hydrocarbons, particularly C2âˆ’C4, on Bâ€�doping of a Coâ€�based catalyst during FT synthesis. The inâ€� creased fraction of cobalt oxide to metallic Co or the decreased reducibilities of the Co catalysts in the presence of B were sugâ€� gested to be responsible for the change in product selectivity. In our case, we still do not have a satisfactory explanation for the role of B in regulating the product selectivity. Future studâ€� ies are needed to clarify the role of B. 4. Conclusions The hydrogenation of CO2 to light (C2âˆ’C4) olefins was studâ€� ied over nonâ€�supported Fe catalysts. We found that modificaâ€� tion of the Fe catalyst, which was prepared by calcining ammoâ€� nium ferric citrate, with alkali metal ions significantly enhanced the conversion of CO2 and the selectivity for C2âˆ’C4 olefins. The selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons, particularly C5+ olefins, was also enhanced by the addition of an alkali metal ion. The forâ€� mation of CH4 and C2âˆ’C4 paraffins was largely suppressed. The fresh catalyst without modification contained iron oxide (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3) phases, which were transformed into Î±â€�Fe together with a small amount of Fe3O4 after reduction in H2 at 673 K. This was also the case for the catalyst modified with an alkali metal ion, but the size of the iron oxide particles in the fresh catalyst was smaller after modification. After reaction under the specified reaction conditions, the formation of Ï‡â€�Fe5C2 ocâ€� curred over the alkaliâ€�metalâ€�ionâ€�modified Fe catalysts, but iron carbide species were not observed in the unmodified catalyst after the reaction. The generation of iron carbide species in the presence of an alkali metal ion was proposed to be one reason for the enhanced catalytic performance. The increase in the amount of CO2 chemisorption as a result of the presence of K + may also contribute to the increased CO2 conversion. The conâ€� tent of K + also affected the catalytic performance. If the K conâ€� tent was too high, this led to a decrease in the surface area and the amount of CO2 chemisorption and thus decreased the conâ€� version of CO2. We found that the addition of a small amount of B to the Kâ€�modified Fe catalyst could suppress the formation of C5+ hydrocarbons and increase the selectivity for C2âˆ’C4 hydroâ€� carbons, without significantly increasing the selectivity for CH4. With an appropriate B content, the selectivity for C2âˆ’C4 olefins reached 52%. This provided another possibility for regulating the product distribution.

It was found that the addition of alkali metal ions to the Fe catalyst led to significant increases in both the CO2 conversion and the selectivity for olefins. Over K- or Rb-modified catalysts, about 40% CO2 conversion and more than 50% olefin selectivity were obtained. The yield of C2–;C4 olefins exceeded 10% over these modified catalysts. Catalyst characterization suggested that the formation of iron carbide species was accelerated by the modification of the Fe catalyst with alkali metal ions, and this enhancement may be one of the key reasons for the enhanced catalytic performance. For the K-modified Fe catalysts, K content has a major influence on the catalyst behavior. An increase in the K content from 1 to 5 wt% increased both CO2 conversion and olefin selectivity. However, too high a K content led to a decrease in the activity, probably because of decreases in the surface area and CO2 chemisorption capacity of the catalyst. The presence of an appropriate amount of B in the K-modified Fe catalyst was found to be beneficial to the olefin selectivity, without significantly decreasing the conversion of CO2. 摘要 研究了非负载型铁催化剂上CO2加氢制低碳烯烃反应. 结果显示, 添加碱金属可显著提高铁催化剂上的CO2转化率和烯烃选择性. 在经K和Rb修饰的Fe催化剂上, CO2转化率可达约40%, 烯烃选择性达到50%以上, 其中C2∼C4烯烃收率超过10%. 催化剂表征结果表明, 碱金属促进了催化剂中碳化铁的生成, 这可能是催化剂性能提高的一个关键原因. 随着K含量由1 wt%增加至5 wt%, CO2转化率及烯烃选择性均升高. 但K含量过高时, 催化剂活性降低. 这可能是由于催化剂比表面积和CO2化学吸附量降低所致. 当K含量为5%∼10%时, K-Fe催化剂上烯烃收率较高; 进一步添加适量的硼可进一步提高烯烃选择性, 且CO2转化率下降不大. Graphical Abstract The modification of a non-supported Fe catalyst by alkali metal ions, particularly K+, in combination with a small amount of B, significantly enhanced the hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins.
