The direct conversion of methane and benzene into value-added, transportable methanol remains a major challenge due to the high activation energy required to cleave the strong C–H bond in methane. Developing efficient catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane to methanol and benzene to phenol under mild conditions is of utmost importance. In this study, a single cobalt transition-metal atom anchored on an MXene monolayer (Co@Mo2CS2) was investigated as a catalyst for methane and benzene oxidation into hydroxylated products using density functional (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Co@Mo2CS2 exhibits outstanding catalytic performance via non-radical pathways. For methane, C–H bond dissociation is the rate-determining step, with an activation energy barrier of 1.19 eV. For benzene, the transfer of an adjacent hydrogen atom from carbon to oxygen is the rate-determining step, with an energy barrier of 0.81 eV. In addition, electronic structure analyses and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations demonstrate that Co@Mo2CS2 possesses excellent thermal stability. These findings offer a novel strategy for the rational design of single-atom catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane and benzene to methanol and phenol.

Methane, the primary component of natural gas, holds immense potential as a feedstock for producing value-added oxygenates like methanol (CH3OH), a versatile precursor for fuels and chemicals [1–4]. However, storing and transporting methane is challenging due to its low combustion efficiency and the significant pollutants produced during combustion [5]. Therefore, converting CH4 into high-value, easily transportable chemicals is of great importance [6,7]. At present, CH3OH is still primarily produced by converting methane into synthesis gas (CO, H2), a process that requires a significant amount of energy [8]. Although this method enables relatively high methanol yields [9,10], it is costly and prone to sulfur poisoning [8]. In contrast, direct conversion offers clear economic and environmental benefits by bypassing the energy-intensive and environmentally detrimental syngas step. Similarly, the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol (C6H5OH) is a cornerstone reaction in the chemical industry, as phenol serves as a vital intermediate in the synthesis of polymers, pharmaceuticals, fibers, and agrochemicals [11]. The industrial production of phenol currently relies on the three-step cumene process [12], which suffers from several drawbacks, including high energy consumption and challenges in product separation [13]. However, both methane hydroxylation and benzene hydroxylation remain inherently challenging due to the inertness of C–H bonds in methane and the high stability of aromatic systems in benzene. These factors necessitate harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperatures and pressures) or the use of aggressive oxidizing agents, leading to high energy consumption, low selectivity, and environmental concerns. This underscores the urgent need for efficient catalysts for the direct conversion of methane and benzene to their corresponding alcohols. Researchers have extensively explored a wide range of catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane, including perovskite oxides [14], metal oxides [15–18], metal-exchanged zeolites [19], metal clusters [20], and metal-doped two-dimensional materials [21–25]. However, many of these systems are limited by factors such as reliance on noble transition metals, stringent reaction conditions, low activity, and poor stability [26–29]. Early studies, particularly those by Schwarz in the 1990s, emphasized the effectiveness of a metal-oxygen active sites, where oxygen plays a critical role in activating the C–H bond, and the resulting methyl group binds to the transition metal to convert methane directly to methanol [30]. Similarly, the direct hydroxylation of benzene to phenol has been investigated using various environmentally friendly oxidants, including molecular oxygen (O2) [31–34], hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [35–40], mixtures of oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) [41–43], and nitrous oxide (N2O) [44–48], each following distinct reaction pathways. High-temperature conditions in these processes can lead to over-oxidation, reducing both the selectivity and yield of phenol [49]. However, nitrous oxide is commercially attractive because it not only promotes the reaction effectively but can also be recovered as an inexpensive by-product at the end of the process [50]. Therefore, the development of low-cost, green, heterogeneous catalysts capable of enabling one-step methane and benzene hydroxylation under mild conditions remains a significant industrial imperative. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) [51], featuring isolated transition-metal atoms anchored on supports such as metal oxides, transition metals, and 2D materials including graphene, boron nitride, metal dichalcogenides, MXene, and phosphorene, have emerged as a revolutionary class of materials due to their exceptional atomic efficiency, tunable electronic properties, and high catalytic activity. SACs have been applied in the wide range of reaction, including CO oxidation [52–59] and electrochemical processes such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [60,61], oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [62], hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [63–65], nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) [66] and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [67–69]. Cobalt-based SACs, in particular, have attracted attention for their cost-effectiveness and versatile redox activity in various catalytic transformations [55,67,70–72]. However, the performance of SACs is highly dependent on the choice of support material, which governs their stability, electronic structure, and accessibility of active sites [51,73]. Two-dimensional MXenes, a family of transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides derived from the MAX phase [74,75], have emerged as promising catalyst supports owing to their high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and thermal stability [76–78]. Among MXenes, molybdenum-based structures such as Mo2CS2 exhibit unique electronic properties and hydrophilic sulfur surface terminations that can facilitate strong interactions with transition-metal atoms, making them ideal candidates for stabilizing SACs [55,67]. In this study, we investigate the catalytic potential of single cobalt (Co) atoms supported on Mo2CS2 MXene (Co@Mo₂CS₂) for the hydroxylation of methane and benzene using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The choice of Co@Mo₂CS₂ is motivated by the synergistic effects anticipated between the Co single atoms and the MXene support: (i) the high surface area and sulfur-rich termination of Mo2CS2 may stabilize Co atoms while modulating their electronic environment, and (ii) the redox-active Co centers may activate N2O oxidants to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for selective C–H bond cleavage. We systematically evaluate the adsorption energetics, reaction pathways, and activation barriers for the conversions of methane to methanol and benzene to phenol, elucidating the roles of the Co active sites and the MXene support in mediating these transformations. This work advances the fundamental understanding of MXene-supported SACs for hydrocarbon functionalization and provides actionable insights for designing cost-effective, earth-abundant catalysts to enable greener and more efficient chemical processes. The findings may pave the way for practical applications in natural gas valorization, aromatic chemistry, and sustainable industrial catalysis. 2 Computational methods Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were executed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [79,80]. The electron–ion interactions were treated using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method [81,82], and the exchange–correlation energy was described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [83,84]. Long-range van der Waals interactions were accounted for using the Grimme DFT-D3 dispersion correction method [85]. The plane-wave energy cutoff of 400 eV was employed. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid. The total energy convergence criterion was set to 10−5 eV, with Gaussian smearing applied using a width of 0.05 eV. All ionic positions were relaxed until the maximum atomic force on any atom was <0.02 eV/Å. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was introduced along the out-of-plane direction to eliminate spurious interactions between periodic images. The Mo2CS2 monolayer was modeled using a 4 × 4 supercell, containing 16 carbon, 32 sulfur, and 32 molybdenum atoms. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out in the NVT ensemble at 500 K using a Nosé–Hoover thermostat [86,87] for 10 ps with a time step of 2.0 fs to evaluate the thermal stability of the Co@Mo2CS2 single-atom catalyst. A grid-based Bader charge analysis [88–90] was employed to evaluate the charge redistribution induced by molecular adsorption on the substrate. Transition-state (TS) structures were located using the dimer method as implemented in the VTST code [91–93], and vibrational frequency calculations were performed to confirm that each optimized transition state exhibited a single imaginary frequency. The binding energy (ΔE b) of a Co atom on Mo2CS2 is calculated as: Δ E b = E Co @ Mo 2 CS 2 − E Mo 2 CS 2 − E Co Where E Co@Mo2CS2 is the total energy of the Co-adsorbed Mo2CS2 monolayer, E Mo2CS2 is the energy of the pristine Mo2CS2, and E Co is the energy of an isolated Co atom. The adsorption energy (ΔEads ) of an intermediate is defined as: Δ E ads = E total − E Co @ Mo 2 CS 2 − E adsorbate Where E total is the total energy of Co@Mo2CS2 with the adsorbed intermediate, E Co@Mo2CS2 is the energy of Co adsorbed Mo2CS2, and E adsorbate is the energy of the free adsorbate. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and electronic properties of Co@Mo2CS2 The optimized structure of the two–dimensional (2D) sulfur-terminated MXene monolayer (Mo2CS2) is displayed in Fig. 1 . The Mo2CS2 monolayer consists of five atomic layers, with C atoms occupying octahedral sites within the Mo lattice and S atoms terminating the surfaces. Each Mo atom is coordinated to three C atoms and three S atoms. The optimized lattice constant are a = b = 3.08 Å, and the calculated Mo–C and Mo–S bond lengths are 2.20 and 2.40 Å, respectively, in good agreement with previous reports [76]. Three potential binding sites for transition-metal anchoring were considered: the Mo-top, Mo-hollow, and S-top sites (Fig. 1 and Figure S1). The binding energy calculational reveal that the Co atom preferentially binds at the Mo-top site, where it coordinates with three sulfur atoms, consistent with earlier studies [72–76]. The optimized structure of Co@Mo2CS2 is shown in Fig. 2 . The binding energy of the Co adatom is –3.77 eV. The Co–S bond distances are 2.06 Å, notably shorter than the sum of the single-bond covalent radii of Co and S (2.14 Å) [94], demonstrating strong covalent interactions (Fig. 2a). The strong adsorption energy suggests that Co atom diffusion and aggregation are energetically unfavorable. To further evaluate thermal stability, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted at 500 K over 10 ps (Figure S2). Throughout the simulation, the Co atom remained stably anchored at the Mo-top site with negligible fluctuations in Co–S bond lengths. The stability of the embedded Co atom was further assessed by calculating its migration from the most favorable site to a neighboring site. As shown in Figure S3, the process is endothermic by 0.53 eV with a migration barrier of 1.19 eV, indicating negligible mobility at ambient temperature. Recognizing that transition metal atom aggregation poses a major challenge for single-atom catalysts during repeated catalytic cycles, an additional AIMD simulation was performed with two Co atoms on a 4 × 4 Mo2CS2 supercell (Figure S4). Notably, both Co atoms remained isolated at their respective Mo-top sites throughout the 10 ps simulation at 500 K, confirming the high stability of Co@Mo2CS2 and its strong resistance to cluster formation. To elucidate the electronic structure of Co@Mo2CS2, we investigated its Bader charge, charge density difference (CDD), and projected density of states (PDOS). The Bader charge analysis reveals that the Co atom carries a positive atomic charge of +0.62 |e|, indicating electron transfer from the Co atom to the Mo2CS2 monolayer (Fig. 2a). The electron donation supports the strong interaction between Co and the Mo2CS2 monolayer. The CDD plots further corroborate this charge redistribution, highlighting regions of electron accumulation and depletion around the Co atom and the adjacent sulfur atoms (Fig. 2b). The PDOS analysis shows significant hybridization between the Co-d orbitals and S-sp orbitals near the Fermi level, confirming strong electronic coupling and covalent character in the Co–S interactions. 3.2 Adsorption and decomposition of N2O on Co@Mo2CS2 The adsorption and decomposition of N2O on Co@Mo2CS2 were systematically investigated to elucidate the catalytic activity and reaction mechanisms. The adsorption of N2O is mediated by the interaction between the O-end of the N2O molecule and the Co active site, shown in Figure S5a. The calculated adsorption energy, E ads(N2O) is –0.42 eV. Upon adsorption, the Co–O bond length is 2.12 Å, while the O–N bond slightly elongates to 1.21 Å, and the N–N bond contracts to 1.14 Å, compared to the free N2O molecule (O–N: 1.19 Å; N–N: 1.15 Å). The Bader charge analysis reveals that the adsorbed oxygen atom acquires a charge of –0.42 |e|, while the Co atom becomes more positively charged (+0.64 |e|), consistent with electron density accumulation on the N2O species and indicating activation of N2O (Figure S5b). The decomposition of N2O proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, as illustrated in the calculated energy profile (Fig. 3 ). In the first step, N2O adsorbs onto Co@Mo2CS2, followed by dissociation into molecular N2 fragment and an adsorbed O atom on the surface. The overall decomposition process is exothermic, releasing –1.33 eV, with an activation barrier of 0.28 eV for N2O dissociation. Subsequently, N2 desorbs from the surface with a low energy cost of 0.13 eV, yielding a Co–O active site. These findings indicate that N2O dissociation occurs efficiently on Co@Mo2CS2, supporting its potential as an effective catalyst for oxygen activation. 3.3 Oxidation of methane to methanol on O/Co@Mo2CS2 Following the departure of the formed N2 molecule, the single-dispersed Co–O remains anchored on the Mo2CS2 monolayer. The oxidation mechanisms of methane leading to various oxidative products, such as methanol, carbene, and methyl radical intermediates, were explored to understand reaction selectivity. The computed potential energy surface (PES), along with the corresponding structures (transition states, intermediates, and products) for methane oxidation catalysed by O/Co@Mo2CS2, is shown in Fig. 4 . For methanol production, two distinct reaction pathways were identified: the radical and non-radical pathways. First, we examined the adsorption of CH4 on O/Co@Mo2CS2 . The calculated adsorption energy for CH4 on O/Co@Mo2CS2, is –0.42 eV (IM1’, Fig. 4), indicating physisorption, which is consistent with previous reports [40,42]. Notably, there is no significant change in the C–H bond length in IM1’ compared to the optimized gas-phase methane molecule (1.09 Å). The adsorbed CH4 can interact through van der Waals forces with adjacent O (oxo) atoms, which facilitates C–H bond dissociation. To better understand the electronic properties of O/Co@Mo2CS2, we performed Bader charge analysis and charge density differences (CDD) mapping. As shown in Figure S6, the oxygen atom in O/Co@Mo2CS2 carries a higher negative charge (–0.63 |e|), enhancing its ability to attract hydrogen atoms and lowering the energy barrier for the initial C–H bond activation and cleavage. The CDD plots confirm this charge redistribution, revealing electron transfer to the oxygen site (Figure S6b). As shown in Fig. 4b, the weakened C–H bond in (IM1’) facilitates the dissociation of the H atom from the C atom, which then migrates toward the O atom via TS1’-n. The resulting CH3 radical subsequently moves closer to the metal center. In the IM2’-n intermediate, the methyl radical and OH group both reside on the Co site. The calculated activation energy barrier of TS1’-n is 1.19 eV. The bond lengths of Co–C and Co–OH in IM2’-n are 1.98 Å and 1.78 Å, respectively. In the TS1’-n structure, the C···H bond significantly elongates to 1.31 Å, while the O···H bond shortens to 1.33 Å. In contrast, the energy barrier in the radical pathway (TS1’-r) is 1.59 eV (Fig. 4a). After the completion of the first elementary reaction (from IM1’ to IM2’-n/IM2’-r), the subsequent reaction in the non-radical pathway proceeds via TS2’-n to form IM3’-n, with the energy barrier of 1.09 eV. In the radical pathway, the second elementary reaction proceeds via the transition state TS2’-r, yielding IM3’-r with an activation energy barrier of 0.12 eV. Finally, the formed methanol molecule is adsorbed on Co@Mo2CS2 (IM3’-n/IM3’-r) with a Co–O bond distance of 2.03 Å. A comparison of the activation energy barriers for the first and second elementary steps (Fig. 4) reveals that the initial C–H activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) in both the non-radical and radical pathways. Although the overall reactions via both the radical and non-radical pathways are exothermic by 0.04 eV, the corresponding two-step elementary reaction are thermodynamically favorable, exhibiting net exothermicities of about 0.67 eV. Furthermore, CH4 adsorption on the O/Co@Mo2CS2 surface to form intermediate IM1’ is exothermic by 0.42 eV. These favorable energetic contributions facilitate the desorption of CH3OH from the Co@Mo2CS2 surface, thereby enabling regeneration of the catalytic active sites. Notably, the low energy barrier (1.09 eV) associated with the rate-determining step, combined with the exothermic nature of the reaction steps, indicates that the non-radical pathway is viable under mild conditions. The IM2’-n intermediate (CH3–Co–OH/Mo2CS2) can proceed toward of methanol formation; however, alternative pathways leading to carbene and methyl radical species are also possible, as shown in Fig. 4. The IM2’-n intermediate could dissociate into HOCo@Mo2CS2 and a CH3 radical, although this pathway is both thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable. Specifically, the resulting radical species lies 1.54 eV higher in energy than IM2’-n and 0.45 eV above the transition state TS2’-n, indicating an endothermic and energetically disfavored process. Alternatively, hydrogen transfer from the methyl radical to the hydroxyl group may yield a metal-carbene species and water molecule (IM3’-c). This transformation occurs via a four-membered ring transition state (TS3’-c), involving concerted C–H and O–H bond rearrangements, with corresponding bond distances of 1.38 Å and 1.26 Å, respectively. The associated energy barrier of 1.27 eV is significantly higher than that of TS2’-n and slightly lower than TS2’-r, the key transition states in the non-radical and radical pathways, respectively. This relatively high barrier suggests that the formation of the metal-carbene intermediate is kinetically unfavorable, rendering this pathway negligible under the studied conditions. Analysis of the potential energy surface (Fig. 4) further confirms that the direct conversion of methane to methanol is both kinetically and thermodynamically preferred over pathways involving methyl radical or carbene intermediates. These findings highlight the strong reaction selectivity toward methanol production on the Co@Mo2CS₂ single-atom catalyst. 3.4 Oxidation of benzene to phenol on O/Co@Mo2CS2 The complete reaction mechanism for the oxidation of benzene to phenol on O/Co@Mo2CS2, along with the reaction energy profile, is illustrated in Fig. 5 , together with the corresponding key intermediates (IM) and transition states (TS) along the reaction coordinate. Initially, the benzene molecule interacts with the activated hydroxyl spices via van der Waals forces. The calculated adsorption energy of C6H6 is –0.48 eV, indicating week physisorption, with C–H, and C···O bond distances in IM1” of 1.09 Å and 2.87 Å, respectively. Subsequently, the C atom of benzene forms a bond with the active-site O atom through TS1”, leading to the formation of IM2”, with an activation energy barrier of 0.46 eV and a slightly endothermic reaction energy of 0.09 eV. In IM2”, the bond distances of Co–O, C–H, and C–O are 1.79 Å, 1.12 Å, and 1.43 Å, respectively. In TS1”, the Co–O bond slightly elongates to 1.71 Å, while the O–C bond contracts significantly to 1.68 Å. The activated benzene molecule on the Co–O site subsequently transforms into phenol through the migration of an adjacent hydrogen atom from the C atom to the O atom, proceeding via TS2” with an activation energy barrier of 0.81 eV. During TS2”, the cobalt–oxo–benzene complex transitions into a hydroxo complex. The elongation of the C–H bond from 1.09 Å to 1.24 Å, along with the concurrent contraction of the O–H bond from 2.66 Å to 1.37 Å, support the viability of this transition state, facilitating C–H bond cleavage and O–H bond formation. Ultimately, the phenol complex [Co(C6H5OH)] (IM3”) is formed, accompanied by dissociation of the Co–O bond and formation of an O–H bond, with a highly exothermic reaction energy of –1.32 eV. The desorption of phenol from the catalyst surface requires 1.09 eV, reflecting strong bonding between phenol and the active site. To overcome this strong binding, the addition of a proton source (such as water or a mild acid) could protonate the phenoxide intermediate, converting the surface-bound Co–C5H5OH group into free phenol (C6H5OH), which typically exhibits weak binding and can readily desorb, thereby regenerating the catalytic active site. The overall catalytic transformation of benzene to phenol on O/Co@Mo2CS2 is an exothermic process with ΔE = –0.62 eV. Moreover, the initial adsorption of C6H6 on the O/Co@Mo2CS2 surface is exothermic by 0.48 eV. These released energies can help facilitate phenol desorption and promote regeneration of active sites for subsequent catalytic cycles. Therefore, the hydrogen transfer to the O atom of the active site corresponds to the rate-determining step (RDS) in the benzene hydroxylation mechanism. Our results clearly demonstrate that Co@Mo2CS2 exhibits exceptional catalytic activity for benzene oxidation under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. 4 Conclusions In summary, we systematically investigated a single cobalt atom anchored on a Mo2CS2 MXene monolayer as a catalyst for the selective oxidation of methane and benzene into their corresponding hydroxylated products, methanol and phenol, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. With N2O serving as the oxidant, the single Co atoms embedded in Mo2CS2 efficiently facilitate the cleavage of the N–O bond, leading to the formation of catalytically active Co–O sites. The Co@Mo2CS2 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance through a non-radical reaction pathway. In particular, the C–H activation step is identified as the rate-determining step, with calculated energy barriers of 1.19 eV for methane-to-methanol conversion and 0.81 eV for benzene-to-phenol conversion. Importantly, the reaction mechanisms effectively suppress by-product formation, demonstrating high selectivity toward the desired hydroxylated products. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm the excellent thermal stability of the Co@Mo2CS2 catalyst under operating conditions. These findings highlight Co@Mo2CS2 as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst for the conversion of methane to methanol and benzene to phenol under mild conditions. This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms but also provides valuable insights for the rational design of efficient single-atom catalytic systems.

        "dc:description": "The direct conversion of methane and benzene into value-added, transportable methanol remains a major challenge due to the high activation energy required to cleave the strong C–H bond in methane. Developing efficient catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane to methanol and benzene to phenol under mild conditions is of utmost importance. In this study, a single cobalt transition-metal atom anchored on an MXene monolayer (Co@Mo2CS2) was investigated as a catalyst for methane and benzene oxidation into hydroxylated products using density functional (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Co@Mo2CS2 exhibits outstanding catalytic performance via non-radical pathways. For methane, C–H bond dissociation is the rate-determining step, with an activation energy barrier of 1.19 eV. For benzene, the transfer of an adjacent hydrogen atom from carbon to oxygen is the rate-determining step, with an energy barrier of 0.81 eV. In addition, electronic structure analyses and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations demonstrate that Co@Mo2CS2 possesses excellent thermal stability. These findings offer a novel strategy for the rational design of single-atom catalysts for the selective oxidation of methane and benzene to methanol and phenol.",
