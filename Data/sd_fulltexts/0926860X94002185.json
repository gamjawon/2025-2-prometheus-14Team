Israel Received 3 May 1994; revised 28 September 1994; accepted 29 September 1994 Abstract The transient sulfur adsorption and reaction on partially sulfided and oxyregenerated Co-Mo-A1 catalysts in the hydrodesulfurization of tteavy atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) was studied in batch and trickle-bed reactors. All experimer.ts were carried out at 360 and 5.5 MPa. The contribution of sulfur adsorption to sulfur removal was significant in cases of 1000-1800 ppm sulfur in the feedstock. The sulfur level in hydrotreated HAGO was lowered by 50-350 ppm due to sulfur adsorption on the catalyst for periods of 20-50 h. The principle of regeneration and adsorption in a trickle bed has been proven. A model that describes the transient adsorption and reaction is proposed.

Introduction Deep hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of atmospheric gas oils in diesel production presents an important challenge to meet new regulations aimed at reducing the sulfur concentration to less than 0.05 wt.-% [ 1,2]. New catalytic routes in HDS of methylated dibenzothiophenes (the least reactive sulfur compounds) [ 3-5 ], mul- tistage schemes [6] and novel reactor design [7] have been proposed to solve the problem. One of the potential solutions for the 'deep HDS problem' is the sulfur adsorption on partially sulfided or oxyregenerated catalysts. It is well known that Ni(Co)- * Corresponding author. Tel.

Yitzhaki et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) 99 110 Mo(W)-A1 oxide catalysts in hydrogen atmosphere adsorb substantial amounts of sulfur (up to 10 wt.-%) depending on temperature and partial pressure of the sulfiding agents [ 8-11 ]. The catalyst's HDS activity increases exponentially with the sulfur concentration [ 12]. The sulfur adsorption in addition to catalytic HDS could enhance the desulfurization of heavy atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) with periodic regeneration of the catalyst when saturated with sulfur. This study investigates the sulfur adsorption on partially sulfided and oxyrege- nerated Co-Mo-A1 catalysts and its effect on deep HDS of HAGO. 2. Experimental The batch HDS experiments were carried out in a 3.8 1 autoclave, manufactured by Autoclave Engineers. A detailed description of the reactor system setup is given elsewhere [ 13 ]. The reactor was charged with 1 1 of HAGO and 50 cm3 of catalyst. Air was evacuated from the reactor by a sequence of high vacuum and hydrogen filling to 0.35 MPa. Then the hydrogen pressure was increased to 1.7 MPa and the reactor was heated to the run temperature of 360. Over the heating period the pressure increased gradually. During a run the pressure dropped periodically by 0.35 MPa and was maintained at 5.5 MPa by adding hydrogen. The stirring speed was 900 rpm. Trickle-bed experiments were carried out in a high-pressure minipilot plant, automatically controlled and designed for unattended continuous runs. A detailed description of the system, including the hardware and software, is given elsewhere [ 14]. 50 cm3 of catalyst were loaded in the reactor between two layers of 20 cm3 silica. The experiments were performed at 360, 5.4 MPa and a hydrogen flow- rate of 500 Nm3/m3 oil. The sulfur concentration in HAGO (after removing H2S by treatment with 1 M NaOH solution) was measured by X-ray fluorescence (Oxford Lab X 1000). The catalyst composition was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) (JEM- 35, JEOL Co., link system AN-1000, Si-Li detector). The sulfur content in the catalyst after three-fold extraction of adsorbed liquid by boiling in ethanol-toluene (mixture 30:70 vol.) in a Soxhlet apparatus for 4 h was measured by a LECO Determinator-444 and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (X-ray spectrometer Phil- ips PW- 1410). The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the HAGO and extract were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer WP-200. The carbon in the catalyst after liquid extraction was measured by burning of a sample in air in a closed glass cell followed by carbon dioxide analysis [ 15]. Before sulfur and carbon analysis, all the used catalysts samples were washed with acetone (2 times, 15 rain each) then dried at 150 for 4 h. The surface area and pore size distribution were measured using the BET method (ASTM 3663-84) and Hg porosimetry (Amin Co. porosimeter, ASTM 4284-83). X-ray diffraction measurements of the catalysts were performed on a conventional, automated Philips PW 1050/70 diffractometer D.

The information was obtained by step-scanning with -0.02steps, l0 s at every step. The data were treated by the Matlab program using Fourier transform analysis. Well crystallized silicon powder was used as a standard indicating instrument related broadening. Phase identifica- tion was carried out according to JCPDS-ICDD powder diffraction file cards. The IR spectra of the catalyst and HAGO were recorded on IR-435 spectrometer (Shi- madzu), the catalyst powder was pressed in pellets with KBr. Two commercial, partially sulfided Co-Mo-A1 catalysts were employed in the experiments. Their composition and characteristics are listed in Table 1. The oxy- regeneration of catalyst B was carried out in a SS tube with a 1% oxygen in nitrogen mixture starting at 250 and increasing gradually to 450 to control the temper- ature gradient. The composition and characteristics of catalyst B following this treatment (completed when no SO2 was detected by gas chromatography in the effluent) are also listed in Table 1.

Results and discussion The atomic ratio S/(Co+Mo) in the partially sulfided catalysts was 0.76 (A) and 0.58 (B) corresponding to about 45 and 34% sulfidation of active metals. This value would be close to 1.7 for a fully stoichiometrically sulfided catalyst (Co9S8 + MoS2) with Co/Mo atomic ratio 0.4. The oxyregeneration removed most of the sulfur, converting the Co-Mo sulfides into single and mixed oxides. The 0.6 wt.-% sulfur detected in catalyst B after oxyregeneration could be attributed to sulfates [ 11 ]. A significant increase in the surface area, pore volume and size after oxyregeneration could be explained by the removal of molybdenum sulfide layers on the catalysts surface, oriented at a non-zero angle to the pore walls [16,17], causing partial blocking of the pores. A set of batch experiments was designed to test the sulfur adsorption effect by changing the reaction time and the sequence of fresh catalysts and HAGO feedstock treatments. Six experiments were done with every partially sulfided catalyst at standard temperature and pressure, as listed in Table 3. The results of sulfur analysis (in HAGO hydrotreated with catalysts A,B and catalyst B) and carbon analysis on the catalyst B are listed in Table 4. As the residence time in the reactor increased from 6 to 12 h in Runs l and 2, the sulfur content in HAGO decreased from 1000 to 300 ppm and from 1250 to 400 ppm, for catalysts A and B, respectively. However, replacing the catalyst in the reactor after the first 6 h with fresh catalyst caused a deeper desulfurization to levels of 100 and 50 ppm. This difference accounts for the combined effect of sulfur adsorption on the catalyst and hydrodesulfurization by the catalyst. The hydrodesulfurization activity is expected to increase from its initial value to a steady-state value at a rate determined by the rate of sulfur adsorption. Therefore the two processes are related. The lower sulfur content in HAGO obtained with catalyst A in Runs 1 and 2 is a result of its higher initial activity, while the lower value measured with catalyst B in Run 3 is due to its higher adsorption capacity. Those results are consistent with the chemical composition of the catalysts (Table 1): a higher metal content in catalyst B might decrease its activity as a result of a lower dispersion of the active phase and less sulfidation (lower S/(Co+ Mo) ratio), yielding a higher sulfur capacity, mainly caused by sulfidation of the metals. Employing the catalyst activated for 6 h on fresh HAGO in Run 4 yields a similar sulfur content with catalyst A and a higher value with catalyst B as compared with Table 3 Conditions of the batch HDS experiments [P = 800 psi ( I psi = 6.895 kPa), T= 360] Run 1 Run 2 Run 3 Run 4 Run 5 Run 6 6 h with fresh catalyst and fresh HAGO 12 h with fresh catalyst and fresh HAGO the same as Run 1 and then 6 h with the same HAGO and fresh catalyst the same as Run 1 and then 6 h with the same catalyst and fresh HAGO the same as Run 2 except flushing HzS from the reactor with hydrogen after 6 h the same as Run 4, and then 6 h with the same catalyst after ethanol-toluene extraction and fresh HAGO D.

Before toluene-ethanol extraction. the results in Run 1. It means that the contribution of sulfur adsorption is more significant in the case of catalyst B, as indicated in Run 3. The results in Run 5 show that HzS has a negligible effect on the catalyst's activity. Furthermore, no deactivation was detected based on the results of Run 6. The amount of sulfur adsorbed on catalyst B, estimated from the difference between the sulfur content on the catalyst measured after Runs 3 and 1, agrees with the value calculated from the amount of sulfur removed between Runs 2 and 3. X-ray diffractograms and IR spectra of fresh and used catalyst B after liquid extraction in Run 2 were measured to characterize the adsorbed sulfur. X-ray analysis (Fig. 1 ) showed that in fresh catalyst B cobalt and molybdenum form an oxysulfide phase CoMoS2.17Ol ~2 identified according to JCPDS-ICDD card 16- 438. After Run 2 the main peaks, corresponding to this phase (20= 26.268 and 18.866, disappeared, while the peaks increased that correspond to MoS2 (JCPDS- ICDD card 17-744) and Co9Ss (JCPDS-ICDD card 19-364), obtained from further sulfidation of the catalyst during the run. In the IR spectrum of catalyst B after Run 2, new bands at 1440 and 1390 cm-1 appear, corresponding to thiophenic com- pounds [ 18], that are absent in the spectrum of the fresh catalyst, but exist in the spectrum of HAGO (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 gives the NMR spectra of a toluene-ethanol mixture before and after extraction of catalyst B used in Run 2 and HAGO, hydro- treated in Run 2. A strong rise was observed of the peak intensity in the spectra of the extracts in regions of the chemical shifts 1 and 3-4 ppm, corresponding to protons of aromatic-paraffinic-naphthenic and O-S-N compounds [ 19]. They are also present in the HAGO spectra. This, along with the decrease from 6.5 to 6.3 wt.-% of the sulfur content in the catalyst after extraction (Table 4), indicates filling of the catalyst pores with weakly adsorbed HAGO. It means that sulfur is adsorbed on the catalyst by three routes: as sulfidation of metal components, strong adsorption of thiophenic compounds on the catalysts surface and weak adsorption in the catalysts pores as sulfur compounds dissolved in HAGO. It can be assumed 104 D.

The sulfur concentration in effluent HAGO from a trickle bed operating in transient mode, is determined by two factors: increasing HDS activity with catalyst sulfidation and adsorption on the catalyst. The sulfur uptake from HAGO by adsorp- tion increases linearly up to saturation of the catalyst [8]. The catalyst's HDS activity rises exponentially with sulfur uptake [ 12]. Neglecting the initial HDS activity of the catalyst, the time dependence of the sulfur content in hydrotreated HAGO at the beginning of the run in a fixed bed reactor could be described by the following equations: So., = Si. - Sa~. - B In t; t < tads.

Four runs were carried out with a partially sulfided catalyst B, that showed a higher adsorption effect in batch runs, feeding fresh HAGO at LHSV = 2.6 h and HAGO, hydrotreated in the first run, at LHSV = 2.6 and 0.85 h- ~. Two runs were carried out with an oxyregenerated catalyst B using hydrotreated HAGO at LHSV 1.5 h- i. The time dependency of the sulfur content in the products during those runs is shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Carbon and sulfur content in the catalysts are listed in Table 5. The runs were designed to generate the typical sulfur concentration change with time. Feeding fresh HAGO with high sulfur content yields a fast change in the outlet sulfur concentration with time. Within about 7 h steady state is reached. This is a result of the rapid change in catalyst activity due to sulfur adsorption. Lowering 106 D.

This is a result of the combination of a slow increase in catalyst activity (low sulfur feed) and significant sulfur adsorption.

( 1 ). Then the outlet sulfur content increases gradually. In the case of oxyregenerated catalyst (Fig. 5), the zero outlet sulfur level was sustained at a higher LHSV of 1.5 h 1 for more than 40 h due to the high adsorption capacity of the catalyst. A higher sulfur content in the feed (Fig. 5) gave a gradual change in sulfur with time up to steady state, reached after about 20-30 h. The results of sulfur and carbon content in catalyst B from trickle-bed runs (Table 5) are consistent with the data. With high sulfur feedstock the catalyst reaches the steady-state sulfur concentration after about 7 h. With low sulfur feed- stocks the partially sulfided and oxyregenerated catalysts contain less sulfur. The carbon in the catalysts reaches about 4 wt.-% after 45-65 h independent of the feedstock's sulfur concentration. The data of some of the runs can be used to estimate values of B and C in Eq. ( 1 ). The values listed in Table 5 show that C is constant in all cases while B depends on inlet sulfur concentration and implicitly on the operating conditions. An attempt to measure the sulfur adsorption independent from HDS was done by treating the low S~n HAGO with catalyst B in nitrogen flow. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that in absence of hydrogen the catalyst adsorbs much less sulfur ( C ~ 100 ppm/h), confirming the results obtained earlier in batch experiments [ 8 ]. In nitrogen atmosphere no HDS occurs that, according to [20], enriches the cata- lysts surface with adsorbed H2S and SH groups. It means that there is a mutual enhancement effect between HDS and sulfur adsorption: sulfur adsorption increases the catalyst's HDS activity, while HDS increases the sulfur adsorption rate. D.

Conclusions Sulfur adsorption on HDS catalysts plays an important role in the transient behavior of the HDS process. Under certain conditions, a low effluent sulfur level can be maintained for limited periods of time. Therefore a sulfidation-regeneration process presents an interesting option for deep HDS.

Box 653, 84105, Beer-Sheva, Israel * Corresponding author. Tel. (+972-7) 472141, fax. (+972-7) 236446. The transient sulfur adsorption and reaction on partially sulfided and oxyregenerated CoMoAl catalysts in the hydrodesulfurization of heavy atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) was studied in batch and trickle-bed reactors. All experiments were carried out at 360°C and 5.5 MPa. The contribution of sulfur adsorption to sulfur removal was significant in cases of 1000–1800 ppm sulfur in the feedstock. The sulfur level in hydrotreated HAGO was lowered by 50–350 ppm due to sulfur adsorption on the catalyst for periods of 20–50 h. The principle of regeneration and adsorption in a trickle bed has been proven. A model that describes the transient adsorption and reaction is proposed.
