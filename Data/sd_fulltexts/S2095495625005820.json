Graphical abstract PES@C is fabricated by an electrochemical self-induced catalyst gel encapsulation strategy, which shows superior bromine conversion kinetics improvement. Zn||Br2 flow cells harvest an energy efficiency of 81 % at 200 mA cm−2. Benefiting from features such as high-voltage platforms, superior energy density, and cost-effectiveness, Zinc-bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) demonstrate significant potential for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: sluggish Br2/Br− redox reactions and severe shuttle effects, which lead to diminished energy efficiency and self-discharge. Here, we develop an innovative electrochemical self-induced catalyst gel encapsulation strategy. Under electrochemical driving, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, abbreviated as PES) catalyst spontaneously undergoes gelation and coating on carbon fibers, thereby forming a PES@C composite cathode with enhanced bromine conversion reversibility. This innovative strategy effectively addresses three critical challenges in existing ZBFBs: shuttle effect, low bromine utilization, and poor energy efficiency. PES@C with sulfur sites and C–O-C group enable efficient bromine/poly-bromide anchoring through strong polar interactions, effectively suppressing shuttling effects. Furthermore, the abundant active sites exhibit exceptional catalytic activity towards Br2/Br− redox reactions. This synergistic adsorption-catalysis mechanism significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of ZBFBs. The ZBFBs with PES@C achieve stable operation under ultrahigh current density (200 mA cm−2) and high areal capacity (40 mA h cm−2), delivering outstanding voltage efficiency (84.91 %) and energy efficiency (81.78 %). Notably, the proposed strategy demonstrates universal applicability for performance enhancement in various bromine-based battery systems, providing an efficient pathway to improve energy efficiency and cycling durability in bromine-based flow batteries. Keywords Zn||Br2 flow batteries Bromine catalysis PEDOT:PSS Energy storage 1 Introduction Against the backdrop of urgent demands for global energy transition, traditional fossil fuel-dominated systems are facing dual pressures of resource depletion and environmental constraints [1–3]. To address energy security challenges and achieve carbon neutrality goals [4], developing renewable energy like wind and solar has become an international consensus. However, the inherent meteorological sensitivity and diurnal periodicity of renewable energy lead to significant output fluctuations, which severely constrain their grid penetration rates [5]. In this context, electrochemical energy storage technologies have emerged as a critical solution for mitigating renewable intermittency [6–8], owing to their superior grid regulation capabilities, flexible spatiotemporal energy transfer characteristics, and off-grid power supply advantages. Compared to traditional energy storage systems such as lithium/sodium-ion batteries, aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) demonstrate distinctive engineering advantages [9–11]. ARFBs exhibit advantages such as low cost and high intrinsic safety while achieving independent power-capacity regulation through decoupled electrolyte/stack design. Compared to pumped hydro and compressed air technologies, the modular architecture of flow batteries effectively overcomes geographical constraints, demonstrating superior deployment flexibility. These characteristics make ARFBs a crucial solution for grid-scale commercial energy storage applications. As an important ARFB variant, zinc-bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) are regarded as one of the most promising large-scale storage technologies due to high theoretical voltage (1.85 V vs. Zn/Zn2+), low cost, and high theoretical energy density (440 Wh kg−1) [12]. However, ZBFBs face critical challenges, including severe self-discharge and low energy efficiency, primarily caused by polybromide diffusion and sluggish Br2/Br− reaction kinetics [13]. To address the shuttle effect, researchers have primarily introduced bromine complexing agents (BCAs) into electrolytes to immobilize polybromides [14]. Typical examples like N-methyl-N-ethyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (MEP) chemically coordinate with Br3 − species to stabilize them in the liquid-phase system [15]. However, the incorporation of BCAs significantly reduces electrolyte conductivity, further deteriorating electrochemical reaction kinetics and battery polarization. For the challenging Br2/Br− redox reactions, carbon-based materials such as carbon felt have become the preferred electrode choice for ZBFBs due to their high conductivity and bromine corrosion resistance. Current research focuses on modifying graphite felt electrodes to enhance their catalytic activity for Br2/Br− redox reaction [16]. For instance, Li et al. constructed three-dimensional TiN nanorod arrays on carbon felt substrates to improve Br2/Br− electrocatalytic activity and reduce electrochemical polarization [17]. Additionally, the introduction of heteroatoms like N and O has been proven beneficial for achieving high catalytic activity in Br2/Br− reactions [18]. While these studies have partially addressed low energy efficiency issues, they face challenges including complex preparation processes and difficulties in scaling up for industrial production [19]. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PES), as a next-generation functional conductive polymer, has garnered widespread attention in both academic and industrial circles due to its exceptional redox activity and high electron affinity [20]. Charge carriers are transferred from the 3p orbital of sulfur atoms in PEDOT’s thiophene rings to negatively charged PSS dopants, generating delocalized holes and polaron bands that enable efficient p-type conduction [21]. This mechanism significantly enhances the reversibility of Br2/Br− redox reactions. Moreover, its excellent flexibility and superior physicochemical stability ensure reliable performance in highly oxidative electrolyte environments. In this work, we innovatively developed an electrochemical self-induced catalyst gel encapsulation strategy for interface engineering: partially polymerized PES precursors were pre-dispersed in the catholyte. During the initial charging process of ZBFBs, the oxidation of Br− at the cathode generates Br2 as a chemical trigger, which subsequently drives the further polymerization of PES. Ultimately, PES spontaneously undergoes gelation and uniformly coats the carbon felt fibers, forming a PES@C composite electrode with gradient sulfur/oxygen functional group distribution. Both experimental and computational results demonstrate that the S/O-enriched PES exhibits exceptional adsorption capacity for Br− and polybromides, while significantly reducing the reaction energy barrier for Br2/Br− redox couple. The ZBFBs assembled with PES@C cathodes demonstrated outstanding stability and reliability, exhibiting a high voltage efficiency of 84.91 % and energy efficiency of 81.78 % at a high current density of 200 mA cm−2. These performance metrics significantly surpass those of unmodified cathodes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The following chemical reagents were purchased from Aladdin and used as received without further purification: PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS = 1:6, 1.5 wt% aqueous solution), zinc bromide (≥99.9 % metals basis), potassium chloride (≥99.8 %), 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bromide (MEP, ≥99.9 %), 4,4′-bipyridine (≥98 %), 2-bromoethanol (≥95 %), and acetonitrile (≥99 %). Daramic HP (175 μm and 900 μm) membrane was used to assemble batteries for performance testing. Commercial carbon felt was used directly as electrodes for all experiments. 2.2 Preparation of PES@C cathode PES@C was obtained by circulating PES-containing catholyte through ZBFBs under one charge–discharge cycle at current densities of 40–160 mA cm−2 and a capacity of 40 mA h cm−2. The optimized PES-modified electrolyte composition consisted of 2 M ZnBr2 + 3 M KCl + 0.4 M MEP with 6 % (v/v) PES additive. During the charging process, spontaneous polymerization of PES occurred, resulting in conformal coating on carbon fiber surfaces. 2.3 Physical characterization The surface morphology of the carbon felt electrodes was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Sigma 300, Germany). The chemical composition of the carbon felt surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a MULTILAB 2000 Base system (Thermo Scientific, UK). The French HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution micro-confocal Raman system (532 nm laser) was employed to characterize defects in the carbon felt structure within the 300–2000 cm−1 wavenumber range, while the evolution of bromine species was dynamically monitored in situ using an electrochemical cell in the 100–350 cm−1 spectral region. The Bruker AVANCE III HD 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer was used to perform NMR analysis on the self-synthesized samples. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization To investigate the electrochemical performance of the PES@C electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted using a carbon felt disc with a diameter of 11.3 mm as the working electrode, a graphite electrode as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under the same system, with a frequency range of 105 to 10−1 Hz. For the single-cell cycling test, carbon felts of 2 × 2 cm2 were used as the cathodes and anodes of the flow batteries. Each electrolyte reservoir contained 40 mL aqueous solution comprising 2 M ZnBr2, 3 M KCl, and 0.4 M MEP, with 6 % (v/v) PES exclusively added to the catholyte for the synthesis of PES@C. For polarization curve and power density testing, the flow battery was first charged to a 50 % state of charge (SOC) at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. Both the catholyte and anolyte consisted of an aqueous solution containing 0.6 M ZnBr2, 2 M KCl, and 0.4 M MEP, with an additional 6 % (v/v) PES added to the catholyte. Constant-current charge–discharge testing was performed using a Neware battery testing system under thermostatic conditions, with the discharge cutoff voltage set at 0.6 V. 2.5 Theoretical calculations All density functional theory (DFT) computations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [22] with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [23]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [24] was employed for exchange–correlation functional, supplemented with Grimme’s DFT-D3 dispersion correction [25,26] for van der Waals interactions. The interaction between the atomic core and electrons was described by the projector-augmented wave method. A plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV [27,28] was applied throughout the calculations. Structural optimizations were performed using a Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh for Brillouin zone sampling, with convergence criteria set to 1 × 10−6 eV for total energy and 0.02 eV Å−1 for atomic forces [29–31]. Slab models were constructed with ∼15 Å vacuum layers [32] to eliminate periodic boundary artifacts, while the bottom three atomic layers remained fixed at bulk positions [33]. Magnetic moment relaxation was explicitly considered during geometry optimization for systems exhibiting dynamic spin polarization. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation and characterization The molecular structure of PEDOT:PSS is shown in Fig. S1a, consisting of two components: PEDOT and PSS. PEDOT, as the key conductive polymer, is typically obtained through the oxidative polymerization of EDOT using oxidants such as sodium persulfate. PSS, as a strong polyelectrolyte, effectively enhances the solubility of PEDOT, enabling PEDOT:PSS to disperse in water. In order to further demonstrate the spontaneity of the redox reaction, galvanic batteries are designed. In (−)(EDOT) x :PSS|(EDOT) x + y :PSS||Br3 −|Br−(+) system, a cell voltage of 1.012 V was observed (Fig. S1b). According to the relationship between thermodynamic function and cell voltage. Δ G = - n F E < 0 where ΔG, F, and E are the free energy charge, Faraday constant, and cell voltage, respectively. ΔG is less than 0 in this case, suggesting that the Br3 − can spontaneously oxidize and promote the further polymerization of PEDOT. Based on this redox reaction, PES can be oxidized during the charging process and uniformly coated on the surface of carbon felt fibers. Fig. 1 a compares the optical characteristics of the baseline electrolyte with the PES-modified electrolyte. The baseline electrolyte, composed of 2 M ZnBr2 + 3 M KCl + 0.4 M MEP, exhibits colorless transparency, whereas the modified electrolyte with PES catalyst demonstrates homogeneous deep-blue transparency. This modified system maintains stability without agglomeration during prolonged standing, confirming the excellent dispersibility and long-term stability of the PES catalyst within the electrolyte matrix. To elucidate the construction mechanism of the PES@C composite cathode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was systematically employed to characterize the morphological evolution of the carbon felt cathode before and after the first cycle. As shown in Fig. S2, the pristine carbon felt fibers exhibit abundant groove structures on their surfaces, which facilitate stable anchoring of subsequent PES coatings. In striking contrast, the morphology of carbon felt fibers after the first charging process is displayed in Fig. 1b and Fig. S3. SEM analysis reveals that the dispersed PES in electrolyte undergoes a gelation transition during electrochemical activation, forming a dense coating layer on the carbon fiber substrate. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping further confirms the formation of this composite structure: as shown in Fig. 1c, S and O elements exhibit uniform distribution across the fiber epitaxial layer, while the C elemental signal predominantly concentrates in the inner region, unequivocally demonstrating the successful construction of a carbon fiber-PES gel core–shell structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization further elucidates the structural features of the PES coating layer. As illustrated in Fig. S4, the PES gel exhibits a typical flake-like morphology, with C, S, and O elemental distributions showing remarkable spatial consistency. Moreover, it maintains excellent structural integrity under electrochemical cycling and in highly corrosive electrolyte environments. Raman spectroscopy was further employed to verify the core–shell composite structure of the PES@C cathode. As shown in Fig. 1d, the characteristic peaks at 1345 cm−1 (D-band) and 1580 cm−1 (G-band) correspond to structural defects and the graphitization degree of the carbon felt substrate, respectively [34]. The d-band originates from the A1g symmetric breathing mode of sp2 carbon rings, with its intensity positively correlated with defect density [35]. The G-band is associated with the E2g symmetric in-plane stretching vibration of sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms, reflecting the ordering degree of graphitic microcrystals [36]. Notably, the I D/I G intensity ratio of the PES@C composite maintains statistical consistency with pristine carbon felt, confirming that the enhanced bromine catalytic performance stems from the intrinsic properties of PES. Furthermore, the emergence of the 1433 cm−1 characteristic peak can be attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of Cα=Cβ bonds in PEDOT molecular chains [37]. This vibrational mode is closely related to the benzenoid-to-quinoid transition in conductive polymer chains, providing direct spectroscopic evidence for the gelation coating process. Optical microscopy imaging (Fig. 1e) further confirmed the uniformity of the coating layer, while Raman mapping (characteristic peak at 1433 cm−1) spatially verified the continuous PES coating along the carbon fiber outer diameter (Fig. 1f). XPS spectroscopy (Fig. S5) characterization provided additional evidence for the successful construction of this core–shell structure. The PES@C exhibits additional S 2p signals, which can be attributed to the sulfur atoms in the thiophene rings of PEDOT and the SO3 2− groups of PSS [38]. During the formation of PES@C cathode, the catholyte also underwent changes. The variation of catholyte during the first cycle is shown in Fig. S6. Before cycling, the PES-containing solution exhibited a uniform dark blue color (Fig. S6a), indicating that PES was well-dispersed in the catholyte. Upon completion of the first charge–discharge cycle (Fig. S6b), the catholyte turned into a clear pale yellow due to residual bromine, with no remaining PES observed. This suggests that PES achieved complete polymerization and coating on the carbon felt fibers during the first charging process. Furthermore, the flow battery was subjected to constant-voltage discharge of 0.5 V (cutoff current: 0.1 mA cm−2) to remove residual bromine and investigate whether the coated PES would be reduced or decomposed. As shown in Fig. S6c, after complete discharge, the catholyte remained transparent, confirming that PES neither reduces nor decomposes in subsequent cycles. To further investigate whether trace amounts of residual PES were present in the catholyte after complete discharge, we conducted Raman spectroscopy tests. As shown in Fig. S7, compared to the catholyte containing PES, no characteristic Raman peak of PES at 1433 cm−1 was detected in the fully discharged catholyte, confirming the absence of PES in the catholyte. To further elucidate the dynamic evolution mechanism of PES-modified electrolytes, we employed in situ optical microscopy characterization (Fig. S8) to monitor real-time color changes during electrochemical cycling. The PES-containing electrolyte exhibits a blue color, where the hue intensity directly reflects the concentration variation of PES in the solution. Meanwhile, Br2 and polybromides (Br2 n +1 −) generated during charging appear orange-yellow, enabling assessment of bromine content through colorimetric analysis. First, the modified electrolyte’s stability was evaluated through static standing tests. As shown in Fig. 1g, the electrolyte maintained a stable light-blue hue throughout observation, demonstrating homogeneous PES dispersion with excellent stability, and confirming the absence of spontaneous polymerization or gelation. Comparative studies were conducted on PES evolution in precursor electrolytes during initial cycling versus baseline electrolytes. Fig. 1h reveals that the baseline electrolyte showed progressively intensified orange-yellow coloration during charging, indicating continuous oxidative generation of Br2 or polybromides (Br2 n +1 −). Although the color faded during discharge, significant yellow residual persisted post-discharge, reflecting poor bromine conversion reversibility. In striking contrast, the modified electrolyte exhibited a deeper yellow color during charging, later confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy to originate from enhanced Br5 − formation. Remarkably, the complete disappearance of yellow coloration post-discharge confirmed the full conversion of Br2 and polybromides (Br2 n +1 −) to Br−. Concurrent vanishing of the characteristic light-blue tint evidenced complete gelation and coating formation of PES during the initial cycle. 3.2 Cycling performance improvement of ZBFBs with PES@C To systematically evaluate the engineering application value of the PES@C composite cathode, we assembled ZBFBs using both baseline and modified electrolytes for comparative investigation. Through concentration gradient experiments (4 %–10 % v/v), the optimal PES additive concentration was determined to be 6 % (v/v). At this concentration, the ZBFBs demonstrated optimal comprehensive performance under 80 mA cm−2/40 mA h cm−2 operating conditions: Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.9 %, voltage efficiency (VE) of 83.2 %, and energy efficiency (EE) of 82.2 % (Figs. S6 and S7). Consequently, 6 % (v/v) was adopted as the optimal PES additive concentration for subsequent tests. Microstructure characterization and performance tests were conducted on PES@C cathodes prepared at different charging current densities to investigate the influence of current density on PES@C cathode properties. The morphologies of PES@C prepared at various current densities are shown in Fig. S11. At current densities of 40 and 80 mA cm−2, PES uniformly and effectively coated the carbon felt fibers. Even at an ultra-high current density of 160 mA cm−2, PES still exhibited good coating on the carbon felt fibers, though more noticeable aggregation and thickening occurred at fiber junctions. This indicates that PES@C cathodes prepared at lower current densities possess a more uniform and favorable morphology, attributed to the slower generation of Br3 − under these conditions, ensuring a milder oxidative polymerization process for PES. Further cycling tests were conducted on PES@C cathodes prepared at different current densities to investigate the influence of PES@C morphology on performance. As shown in Fig. S12, the results showed that all PES@C samples exhibited similar CE, VE, and EE at 160 mA cm−2 current density with a charging capacity of 40 mA h cm−2. This indicates that current density mainly influences the morphology of the PES coating layer but has negligible influence on its overall performance. Further tests were conducted on the long-term cycling performance of both the baseline system and PES-modified ZBFBs at a current density of 40 mA cm−2/40 mA h cm−2. The EE test results are shown in Fig. S13, with the corresponding CE, VE, and charge–discharge curves presented in Fig. S14. The ZBFB of the baseline system could maintain stable operation under these conditions, but its efficiency performance was relatively poor, with CE, VE, and EE of 97.67 %, 83.87 %, and 81.92 % (average CE, VE, and EE of 97.56 %, 83.37 %, and 81.36 %), respectively. In comparison, the PES-modified ZBFB demonstrated significantly improved electrochemical performance. Cycling performance tests revealed that the PES@C cathode primarily enhances the EE of ZBFBs by improving VE. Under the conditions of 40 mA cm−2 and 40 mA h cm−2, the ZBFB exhibited a significant increase in VE to 91.01 % (average VE of 90.09 %), with no noticeable degradation observed over 200 cycles. Additionally, the CE of ZBFBs showed a slight improvement, attributed to PES as an excellent conductive polymer. Its coating behavior effectively reduces the internal resistance to some extent. The charge–discharge curves of ZBFB shown in Fig. S15 further confirmed this observation. The charge–discharge voltage gap of the ZBFBs using PES-modified catholyte significantly decreased from 287 mV (baseline group) to 150 mV (a reduction of 47.7 %). This improvement is attributed to the high catalytic activity of the PES@C cathode for bromine conversion reaction. Further cycling performance tests were conducted at higher current densities. As shown in Fig. 2 a, under a high current density of 80 mA cm−2, the baseline system exhibited significant fluctuations and degradation in EE during cycling, indicating limited stability of the bromine conversion reaction. Further analysis of its CE and VE (Fig. S16a) revealed that the fluctuations in EE were jointly caused by variations in both CE and VE, with CE displaying more pronounced instability, reflecting kinetic hysteresis and intensified side reactions in bromine redox process. For unmodified carbon felt, bromine diffusion occurs during the early cycling stage and leads to battery self-discharge, consequently causing fluctuations in CE. In contrast, with the PES@C cathode, the ZBFBs demonstrate stable CE throughout the entire cycling period, indicating effective suppression of bromine crossover by PES@C. The fluctuating charge–discharge curve characteristics further supported this observation (Fig. S16b). In contrast, PES@C significantly enhanced the reversibility and stability of bromine conversion reaction under high current densities. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, with the assistance of PES@C cathode, the ZBFB maintained long-term stable operation at a high current density of 80 mA cm−2, achieving a high CE, VE, and EE of 98.54 %, 84.22 %, and 82.99 % (average CE, VE, and EE of 98.26 %, 83.89 %, and 82.43 %). This performance is significantly superior to the baseline system’s EE of 73.96 % (CE of 98.46 %, VE of 75.12 %). Detailed charge–discharge curves (Fig. S17) revealed that the ZBFB using PES-modified catholyte exhibited a discharge voltage plateau as high as 1.62 V, with the charge–discharge voltage gap sharply reduced from 865 mV to 564 mV (a decrease of 34.8 %). However, no significant difference in discharge time was observed between the two systems. This indicates that at a high current density of 80 mA cm−2, PES@C primarily enhances battery performance by improving voltage efficiency. More remarkably, the bromine catalytic performance of the PES@C cathode becomes even more outstanding at an ultra-high current density of 160 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2c, the baseline system suffered severe performance degradation during long-term cycling tests, achieving low EE of only 56.64 % (average EE: 48.58 %), which primarily originated from the substantial decrease and violent fluctuations in CE (Fig. S18a). Under the ultra-high current density of 160 mA cm−2, the baseline ZBFB system exhibited a significant drop in average CE to 83.45 %, markedly lower than its performance at lower current densities (40–80 mA cm−2). This efficiency deterioration stems from the limited catalytic activity of carbon felt for bromine conversion reactions, along with intensified water decomposition side reactions under high electrochemical polarization conditions, leading to progressive battery performance degradation. Notably, the PES@C cathode harvests an outstanding average CE of 98.04 % (Fig. S17) and EE of 66.94 % (Fig. 2c) even at the ultra-high current density of 160 mA cm−2, significantly outperforming the unmodified carbon felt cathode. This remarkable difference was visually confirmed by their detailed charge–discharge curves. The CE results shown in Fig. S18 demonstrate that at an ultrahigh current density of 160 mA cm−2, unmodified ZBFBs exhibit more severe bromine diffusion, causing their CE to sharply decline to 80 % during early cycling due to combined bromine diffusion and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) effects. In contrast, ZBFBs employing PES@C cathodes maintain relatively stable CE throughout 400 cycles. These results confirm that PES@C significantly mitigates both bromine crossover and OER issues, even under extreme current densities of 160 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. S19, the PES@C cathode demonstrated significantly reduced charge–discharge voltage polarization and superior discharge capacity, indicating enhanced reversibility of bromine conversion. The performance enhancement of PES@C cathodes in ZBFBs is also reflected in the improved reversibility of Zn deposition/stripping at the anode side. We conducted morphological characterization of cycled carbon felt anodes (under 160 mA cm−2/40 mA h cm−2 conditions) to compare Zn deposition patterns in both systems. As shown in Fig. S20a–c, significant residual Zn deposits remain on the bare carbon felt cycled without PES modification. These irregular Zn residues are prone to detachment by electrolyte flow, losing electrical contact to become electrochemically inactive “dead Zn”. In contrast, with PES@C cathodes, the enhanced Br2/Br− redox kinetics promote correspondingly more efficient zinc deposition/stripping at the anode. Fig. S20d–f demonstrates only sparse, uniformly distributed Zn on the carbon felt surface, indicating highly homogeneous and reversible Zn deposition/stripping at ultrahigh current density of 160 mA cm−2. Ideally, under equal areal capacity conditions, CE typically increases with higher current densities. However, compared to operation at 80 mA cm−2, ZBFBs at 160 mA cm−2 exhibit lower CE. Such anomalous CE behavior has also been reported in previous studies [39–42]. This behavior results from intensified OER and accelerated bromine diffusion under ultrahigh current densities. The standard electrode potential of OER is 1.23 V vs. SHE, while that of Zn2+/Zn is −0.76 V vs. SHE. This indicates that when the charging voltage of ZBFBs approaches or exceeds 1.99 V, OER becomes thermodynamically favorable. Under the ultrahigh current density of 160 mA cm−2, the charging voltage of ZBFBs exceeds 2.0 V, significantly intensifying the competitive OER behavior. Furthermore, the higher current density leads to rapid Br3 − concentration spikes within the cell stack, which exacerbates bromine diffusion and consequently results in more severe self-discharge behavior. In summary, the combined effects of OER and bromine diffusion-induced self-discharge under high current densities ultimately lead to reduced CE. Different membrane types can significantly impact battery cycling performance. In the aforementioned cycling tests, we initially employed 900 μm-thick Daramic HP membranes (Daramic 900). While excessive thickness effectively suppresses bromine diffusion, it results in lower membrane conductivity and voltage efficiency [43]. Therefore, we subsequently tested 175 μm-thick Daramic HP membranes (Daramic 175) to demonstrate the optimal performance of PES@C cathodes. As shown in Fig. S21 and Fig. 2d, ZBFBs incorporating PES additives with Daramic 175 membranes achieved superior EE of 86.27 % and VE of 89.57 %, significantly outperforming those with Daramic 900 membranes. Notably, however, cells using Daramic 175 membranes exhibited lower CE (96.32 %) compared to Daramic 900 membranes. This indicates that while thinner membranes enable higher battery performance, their bromine diffusion suppression capability is limited. These findings were further validated through analysis of the voltage charge/discharge profiles. Fig. S22 reveals standard voltage polarization curves during initial cycles, whereas abnormal charging voltage plateau depression appears in later cycles - characteristic of self-discharge reactions between diffused bromine and deposited Zn. To further verify the bromine-blocking capabilities of different membranes, we conducted simple diffusion tests using a customized H-cell setup. As demonstrated in Fig. S23, the H-cell equipped with the Daramic 175 membrane exhibited significantly more pronounced bromine diffusion within the same timeframe, providing direct experimental validation of the aforementioned cycling performance results. In subsequent tests, unless otherwise specified, we continued to use Daramic 900 membrane for electrochemical performance testing to ensure long-term stability. The ZBFB with Daramic 175 membrane demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance even at an ultra-high current density of 200 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2e, f, the ZBFB configuration employing Daramic 175 and PES@C cathode achieved remarkable efficiencies: EE of 81.78 % (VE of 84.91 % and CE of 96.31 %). To further demonstrate the advancement of our strategy, we systematically compared the achieved performance with state-of-the-art approaches reported in recent years. As detailed in Fig. S24 and Table S1, the ZBFBs employing PES@C with Daramic 900 membranes already exhibited superior performance compared to other systems employing Daramic 400–900 membranes. More importantly, the ZBFBs combining PES@C with Daramic 175 membranes achieved performance metrics that surpassed all currently reported strategies in the field. Such superior performance can be attributed to: (1) abundant Br2/Br− catalytic active sites provided by PES that reduce electrochemical polarization, and (2) strong adsorption capability of PES for bromine species. To investigate the bromine adsorption behavior of PES@C, we first determined the specific surface areas of bare carbon felt and PES@C cathodes through BET measurements. As shown in Fig. S25, PES@C exhibited a significantly higher specific surface area of 0.715 m2 g−1 compared to bare carbon felt (0.413 m2 g−1), indicating that the in situ coated PES layer possesses superior microporous structures over carbon fibers, which could dramatically enhance the cathode’s bromine capture capability. To compare the bromine adsorption differences between carbon felt and the PES layer, we obtained pure PES coatings through simple galvanostatic charge/discharge. Fig. S26 demonstrates that without a peristaltic pump and flow channel support, PES spontaneously polymerized and formed precipitated layers in solution rather than adsorbing onto the carbon felt surface. This further confirms that bromine generated during charging effectively initiates the oxidative polymerization of PES. The catholyte after cycling was centrifuged, washed with deionized water, and freeze-dried to obtain pure PES coatings. Fig. S27 presents the bromine adsorption test results for PES and bare carbon felt. When 20 mg samples of PES and bare carbon felt were separately immersed in 15 mL of 10 mM Br3 − standard solution (prepared using previously reported methods [44]) for 12 h, the PES-containing solution became clear and colorless, demonstrating its exceptional bromine adsorption capacity. In contrast, the solution containing bare carbon felt showed almost no visible change. The supernatant of the Br3 − standard solution was extracted and diluted for UV–Vis characterization. The results demonstrate that when using the PES coating as the adsorbent, no characteristic absorption peaks of polybromides were observed in the UV–Vis spectrum, which is consistent with the observed decolorization phenomenon. 3.3 Bromine catalytic mechanism research of PES@C As demonstrated by the cycling performance tests above, the superior bromine catalytic capability of PES@C has been fully revealed. We further conducted the theoretical analysis to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of PES@C. First, we employed electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis [45–47] and electron localization function (ELF) distribution to investigate the active sites for the bromine reduction reaction (BrRR) and bromine oxidation reaction (BrOR). Generally, nucleophilic reactions tend to occur at electropositive sites, while electrophilic reactions tend to occur at electronegative sites [48]. The reactions of BrRR and BrOR involve the interconversion of electronegative species such as Br− and polybromides (Br3 −, Br5 −, and Br7 −) [49–51], hence they preferentially take place at electropositive regions. As shown in Fig. 3 a, b, the sulfur atom of the thiophene ring and the carbon site of the C–O–C group exhibit the largest electropositive regions, forming an effective dual-polar active center, which serves as the optimal adsorption site for bromide ions and polybromides. Therefore, in subsequent analyses, we selected this configuration as the optimal adsorption site for adsorption energy calculations. This facilitates the replenishment of Br− or polybromides and promotes subsequent BrOR and BrRR reactions. By comparing the adsorption energies of different bromine species (Br−, Br2, and Br3 −) at the active sites on bare C and PES, we ultimately confirmed the superior adsorption performance of PES and its intrinsic mechanism in facilitating bromide conversion reactions. First, the interactions between different bromine species and the unmodified carbon substrate were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations (the constructed adsorption models are shown in Figs. S28 and S29). For the unmodified carbon substrate, both the most favorable adsorption site and molecular orientation were determined based on previously reports [52]. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the adsorption energies of bare C for Br−, Br2, and Br3 − were −1.109, −0.3, and −1.393 eV, respectively. The inset of Fig. 3c shows the differential charge density plots after adsorption (blue regions indicate electron depletion, while yellow regions represent electron accumulation). Differential charge density analysis reveals the absence of significant electron exchange regions between bromine species and bare C, indicating limited bromine species adsorption capability on bare C. In contrast, PES@C exhibits significantly improved adsorption performance, with adsorption energies of −1.842, −0.587, and −2.257 eV for Br−, Br2, and Br3 −, respectively (Fig. 3d), which are notably superior to those of the unmodified carbon felt (Fig. S30). This strong binding ensures that PES can effectively anchor bromine species and suppress the shuttling effect of soluble Br3 −, thereby achieving stable cycling performance, which is consistent with the aforementioned experimental results. Furthermore, the differential charge density plots shown in the inset of Fig. 3d reveal strong charge transfer interactions between bromine species and the C–S/C–O–C groups in the PES polymer skeleton, with the S sites playing a dominant role in capturing bromine species. These findings are corroborated by the adsorption energy calculations, further confirming that the Br− adsorbed on PES@C is more prone to electron uptake and chemical bond formation. Further investigations were conducted on the Gibbs free energy changes of the BrOR process at different adsorption sites. Based on the Volmer-Tafel and Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanisms [52–54], the bromine oxidation reaction pathway can be described using a three-state energy diagram involving *Br−, *Br2, and Br3 −. As shown in Fig. 3e, the initial state before adsorption (*) was set to 0 eV. The calculated results demonstrate that PES@C exhibits smaller ΔG values for each reaction step compared to unmodified carbon felt, indicating that PES@C significantly promotes the oxidation and desorption of Br−. Additionally, to elucidate the influence of PES@C on Br–Br bond activation, we conducted the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) analysis. As shown in Fig. 3f, compared to the Br2-C system, the partial COHP curve of the Br–Br bond in the Br2-PES@C system exhibited a negative shift, along with reduced antibonding orbital occupancy, indicating that the stronger interaction between PES@C and Br2 weakens the Br–Br bond strength. In summary, while effectively adsorbing and immobilizing bromine species, PES@C also enables efficient catalysis of subsequent BrRR and BrOR reactions, thereby enhancing the reversibility of bromine conversion. 3.4 Electrochemical performance enhancement by PES@C To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of PES-modified electrolyte towards Br2/Br− redox reaction, a three-electrode system was employed. The testing configurations (as shown in Fig. S31) included: baseline electrolyte, PES in electrolyte, and PES in catholyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the impedance characteristics of each system. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the EIS spectra of all three systems consist of a high-frequency semicircular region and a low-frequency linear region. The high-frequency semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance [55]. The low-frequency linear region corresponds to the ionic diffusion resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface [56–58]. For the system without PES, the equivalent circuit shown in the upper inset of Fig. 4a was used to fit the EIS. For the system containing PES, the presence of the PES interfacial layer needs to be considered, so the fitting circuit shown in the lower inset of Fig. 4a was employed for fitting. The fitting data is presented in Fig. 4a, with a focus on comparing the differences in charge transfer resistance (R ct) and diffusion impedance. More detailed fitting data can be found in Table S2 and the corresponding descriptions. The “PES in catholyte” system exhibited the lowest R ct of 0.79 Ω, which is lower than the 1.47 Ω for “PES in electrolyte” and the 7.64 Ω for the “without PES” system. This indicates that the introduction of PES significantly promotes the catalytic conversion reaction of bromine. Additionally, the Warburg resistance (W0-R) can quantitatively characterize the resistance of the diffusion process. The “PES in catholyte” system demonstrated a notably lower Warburg resistance of 0.38 Ω, significantly lower than those of the “PES in electrolyte” (0.97 Ω) and “without PES” (7.64 Ω) systems, suggesting that PES effectively enhances ion diffusion kinetics. This enhancement can be attributed to the excellent conductivity of PES and the increased effective electrode surface area resulting from PES coating. Moreover, compared to the “PES in catholyte” system, the “PES in electrolyte” system shows limited improvement in charge transfer resistance and diffusion impedance. These results demonstrate that introducing PES to the cathode side can significantly promote the bromine conversion reaction, whereas incorporating PES into the anode side impedes the Zn2+/Zn redox reaction. This is attributed to the PSS component in PES, which exacerbates hydrogen evolution at the anode. To further investigate the reaction kinetics of the Br2/Br− redox couple in different systems, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted, which further confirmed the advantages of the PES@C cathode (Fig. 4b). In the low overpotential region, the current density exhibited a linear relationship with the overpotential, where a steeper slope indicates faster reaction kinetics [59]. As shown in Fig. 4b, the “PES in catholyte” system demonstrated the most favorable reaction kinetics. In contrast, the “PES in electrolyte” system exhibited slower kinetics, suggesting that introducing PES into the anolyte may negatively influence the Zn2+/Zn redox process and thus impair reaction kinetics. The LSV results collectively indicate that introducing PES exclusively into the catholyte maximizes the enhancement of reaction kinetics for the Br2/Br− redox couple. This electrochemical behavior was further corroborated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4c, the CV curves of all three systems exhibit similar shapes, indicating that the introduction of PES does not alter the fundamental reaction mechanism of ZBFBs, though notable differences in reaction activity are observed. Consistent with the LSV results, the “PES in catholyte” system demonstrates the highest redox peak currents and the narrowest peak potential separation, confirming the superior catalytic activity and mass transport capability of the PES@C cathode. Further tests were conducted using 0.05 M ZnBr2 + 0.5 M H2SO4 as the baseline electrolyte to evaluate the reversibility of Br2/Br− redox couple in different systems, where H2SO4 was introduced to eliminate the oxygen evolution effect observed in Fig. 4c. As shown in Fig. S32, the PES@C electrode exhibited a smaller peak potential separation (453 mV) compared to bare carbon felt (488 mV), demonstrating superior reaction reversibility for bromine conversion. This enhancement originates from the highly delocalized conjugated system formed by sulfur heteroatoms (with lone electron pairs) and oxygen-containing functional groups in the PES material. Further CV tests were conducted to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the Zn2+/Zn redox reaction in different systems. As shown in Fig. S33, compared with “without PES” system, “PES in catholyte” system exhibited higher redox peak potentials and a narrower redox peak potential separation. This confirms that introducing PES into the catholyte can effectively enhance both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the Zn2+/Zn redox reaction. In contrast, the PES in the electrolyte system exhibited suppressed Zn2+/Zn redox activity. Moreover, the cathodic peak current in “PES in electrolyte” system was significantly higher than the anodic peak current, indicating aggravated HER. In summary, introducing PES solely into the catholyte can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of ZBFBs. To elucidate the electrocatalytic mechanism of the bromine conversion reaction in ZBFBs, we performed in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements on the electrolyte during charge/discharge processes. According to literature reports [60], the symmetric stretching vibration peaks of Br−, Br3 −, and Br5 − species are located at 183, 170, and 258 cm−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4d, e, the baseline electrolyte in its initial state exhibited the strongest Raman signal for Br− at 183 cm−1. During the charging process, the Raman signal of Br3 − at 170 cm−1 progressively intensified. Furthermore, a weak Raman signal of Br5 − emerged at 258 cm−1 during the final charging stage, indicating that Br3 − was the predominant bromine species generated in the baseline electrolyte. Correspondingly, the signals for both Br3 − and Br5 − gradually diminished during the discharge process, reflecting the consumption of these species. In contrast, for the PES-modified catholyte, the strongest Raman signal shifted from Br3 − to Br5 − during the charging process, indicating that Br5 − became the predominant bromine species in this system (Fig. 4f, g). This suggests that the PES-modified catholyte facilitates the further reaction between Br3 − and Br2 to form Br5 −. Such transformation helps maintain higher polybromide concentrations, thereby enabling more efficient bromine conversion while simultaneously suppressing bromine species diffusion. 3.5 Practical application in bromine-based flow batteries To further investigate the application potential of PES@C cathode in bromine-based flow batteries, we conducted polarization tests on ZBFBs using both the baseline electrolyte (0.6 M ZnBr2 + 2 M KCl + 0.4 M MEP) and the PES-modified catholyte (Fig. 5 a). The experimental ZBFBs typically employ single-cell configurations with zinc electrode areal capacities below 100 mA h cm−2. Here, we reduced the concentration of ZnBr2 electrolyte to meet the experimental requirement of 50 % SOC. Decreasing KCl content lowers electrolyte conductivity, thereby better revealing the battery's electrochemical performance under extreme operating conditions. Polarization testing at 50 % state of charge (SOC) shows that the PES modification strategy significantly improved the operating voltage of ZBFBs across various current densities, increasing the peak power density from 375.9 to 423.6 mW cm−2. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. S34, the modified ZBFBs demonstrated exceptional cycling stability at 50 % SOC under the current density of 70 mA cm−2. The PES-enhanced system maintained a high average EE of 81.64 % (average CE of 98.9 % and VE of 82.54 %) throughout 100 charge–discharge cycles. This outstanding electrochemical performance originates from two key aspects: (1) the PES coating effectively enhances the electrode’s electrochemically active surface area; (2) the core–shell structure of PES@C provides chemical confinement effects for polybromide anions. We further conducted morphological characterization of the PES@C cathode after 100 cycles. The SEM results shown in Fig. S35 demonstrate that PES@C cathode still maintains a well-defined core–shell structure with PES-coated carbon felt fibers even after prolonged cycling. This confirms the long-term effectiveness of this strategy. The PES coating layer retains excellent catalytic performance without undergoing reduction or decomposition, even after extended deep charge/discharge cycles. To validate the universal principle of the PES@C catalytic system, we further verified the bromine catalytic effect of PES@C by assembling a viologen||Br2 flow battery. The working mechanism of the selected viologen||Br2 flow battery is illustrated in Fig. 5c, with its active component being (1,10)-di(2-ethanol)-4,40-bipyridinium dibromide ((2HO-V)Br2). The anode involves the redox reaction of (2HO-V)2+, while the cathode involves the redox reaction of Br−. (2HO-V)Br2 was synthesized according to previous reports [61,62], and its structure and purity were confirmed by 1H NMR characterization (Fig. S36). CV test results of the (2HO-V)Br2||Br2 flow batteries (HBFBs) further confirmed the highly efficient bromine-catalyzing capability of PES@C. As shown in Fig. 5d, with the introduction of PES, the HBFBs exhibited enhanced redox peaks, with more pronounced kinetic improvements observed for the Br2/Br− redox reaction. This demonstrates that the PES@C cathode is not only suitable for ZBFBs but also applicable to other bromine-based flow battery systems. Long-term cycling tests of ZBFBs further validated the bromine-catalyzing effectiveness of PES@C. As illustrated in Fig. 5e and Fig. S38, the baseline electrolyte system exhibited average CE, VE, and EE of 90.05 %, 78.2 %, and 73.57 % respectively. In contrast, HBFBs employing PES-modified catholyte demonstrated significantly improved efficiencies of 98.47 %, 89.5 %, and 88.13 %, markedly outperforming the unmodified system. Notably, charge–discharge profiles from extended cycling (Fig. 5f and Fig. S22) revealed that PES incorporation substantially reduced the voltage plateau gap in HBFBs while increasing discharge capacity. These results confirm that the PES@C cathode significantly enhances the reversibility of bromine conversion reactions. 4 Conclusions In summary, we successfully developed a composite cathode material for zinc-bromine flow batteries with high power density and long cycle life through an electrochemically induced in situ polymerization interface engineering strategy. The material features a core–shell structure composed of a PES coating layer and porous carbon fiber substrate. The designed PES@C cathode provides more active reaction sites for the Br2/Br− redox couple and significantly improves the reversibility of bromine conversion reactions. Meanwhile, benefiting from the sulfur atom of the thiophene ring and the carbon site of the C–O–C group, the PES@C demonstrates exceptional bromine adsorption capacity and spatial confinement effects, significantly suppressing the shuttle effect of polybromides and thereby further enhancing the electrochemical activity of electrodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZBFBs equipped with PES@C cathodes achieve a remarkable EE of 81.78 % at an ultra-high current density of 200 mA cm−2, exhibiting outstanding cycling stability. Polarization power tests further demonstrate that ZBFBs employing PES@C cathodes achieve a high-power density of 442 mW cm−2 at an ultra-high current density of 491.5 mA cm−2. More notably, this strategy demonstrates universal catalytic effects across other bromine-based flow battery systems (e.g., (2HO-V)Br2||Br2), achieving a 20 % enhancement in EE (88.13 % vs. 73.57 %) at 491.5 mA cm−2. This breakthrough establishes a cross-system design paradigm for electrode engineering in bromine-based flow batteries. This work provides a novel strategy for developing multifunctional ZBFB electrode materials, which will significantly advance the development of ZBFBs with both high-power density and long cycle life.

        "dc:description": "Benefiting from features such as high-voltage platforms, superior energy density, and cost-effectiveness, Zinc-bromine flow batteries (ZBFBs) demonstrate significant potential for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: sluggish Br2/Br− redox reactions and severe shuttle effects, which lead to diminished energy efficiency and self-discharge. Here, we develop an innovative electrochemical self-induced catalyst gel encapsulation strategy. Under electrochemical driving, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, abbreviated as PES) catalyst spontaneously undergoes gelation and coating on carbon fibers, thereby forming a PES@C composite cathode with enhanced bromine conversion reversibility. This innovative strategy effectively addresses three critical challenges in existing ZBFBs: shuttle effect, low bromine utilization, and poor energy efficiency. PES@C with sulfur sites and C–O-C group enable efficient bromine/poly-bromide anchoring through strong polar interactions, effectively suppressing shuttling effects. Furthermore, the abundant active sites exhibit exceptional catalytic activity towards Br2/Br− redox reactions. This synergistic adsorption-catalysis mechanism significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of ZBFBs. The ZBFBs with PES@C achieve stable operation under ultrahigh current density (200 mA cm−2) and high areal capacity (40 mA h cm−2), delivering outstanding voltage efficiency (84.91 %) and energy efficiency (81.78 %). Notably, the proposed strategy demonstrates universal applicability for performance enhancement in various bromine-based battery systems, providing an efficient pathway to improve energy efficiency and cycling durability in bromine-based flow batteries.",
