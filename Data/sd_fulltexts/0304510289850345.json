HYDROGENATION-STRENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF SURFACE SITES R. SNEL University ofTwente, Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217, 7500 AE Enschede (The Netherlands) (Received July 19, 1988; accepted February 2, 1989) Summary The specific conditions of catalyst pretreatment are known to deter- mine the properties of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts to a large extent. The phenomenon has been investigated and it was found that the extent of reduction of the surface has a major influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity. Methane is formed as the main product on those sites that are the first to be reduced. Further reduction of the surface results in the formation of additional sites with a lower hydrogenation activity, contributing to the synthesis of hydrocarbons according to Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. The number of initial (methanation) sites, once exposed to synthesis gas, stays constant. In contrast, the number of additional (synthesis) sites depends, inter alia, on the degree of prereduction and can be varied by means of reoxidation or further reduction. Depending on the ratio of meth- anation to synthesis sites, a considerable amount of methane can be pro- duced over and above that predicted by Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. Introduction Over the years, we often have observed in our laboratories that, in the initial stages of vapour phase Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on fresh iron-based catalysts, the overall catalytic activity increases whilst the rate of methane formation stays essentially constant. Furthermore, a direct relationship was found between the temperature at which the oxidic catalyst precursor was reduced and the initial overall catalytic activity of the catalyst. These obser- vations have never previously been the subject of an in-depth study, but 0304-5102/89/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 130 the growing number of seemingly unrelated pieces of evidence are now accumulating to form a picture that can no longer be ignored. The specific conditions of catalyst pretreatment are known to have a large influence on the catalytic behaviour. It has been reported that these conditions affect substantially the nature of structure-sensitive behaviour [I], and are even more important than catalyst metal morphology in deter- mining catalyst activity and selectivity [2]. The molecular mass of hydro- carbon products is reported to be lower at lower extents of reduction [3]. Unusual product distributions gradually change to normal distributions with increasing reduction temperatures [4]. The synthesis reaction rate is also known to increase with the severity of reduction conditions [5]. In contrast, recent studies of iron catalysts in slurry reactors show little in- fluence of pretreatment. Only minor differences were observed in catalytic behaviour at steady state, either with a prereduced catalyst or a unreduced catalyst [6]. To date, no explanation has been offered for these observations. It is the purpose of this communication to investigate the nature of these effects in a qualitative way. Model To account for the effects, we propose a model based on the assump- tion that reduction of metal oxide surfaces starts at those centres that have the highest reducibility and that yield sites with strong hydrogenation activity. During hydrocarbon synthesis these sites contribute most to the formation of methane, and hence are referred to as methanation sites. The number of these sites remains essentially constant, once they have been carbided during synthesis. The next type of site to become available during reductive pretreatment has a weaker hydrogenation activity. They contri- bute to hydrocarbon synthesis in general and are referred to as synthesis sites. A freshly reduced catalyst contains mainly sites of these two types and very few other types. Consequently, methane is produced by the methana- tion sites in addition to methane produced in the normal course of hydro- carbon synthesis (according to Anderson-Schulz-Flory product distribution). The exact surface topography depends on the nature of the catalyst and the extent of reduction. The latter is strongly influenced by the reducibility, which in turn is greatly affected by metal-support and/or metal-promoter interactions when these occur. In the initial stage of hydrocarbon synthesis on a partially reduced iron catalyst, oxidation, carbiding and further reduction take place. The last of these is responsible for the formation of a variety of sites, the hydrogenation activity of which is intermediate between those of the two types of site discussed above. Some of the additional sites may have a hydrogenation activity high enough to produce methane. The hydrogenation strength of 131 these sites depends on the nature of the catalyst. The result is that initially a high methane selectivity prevails, and the olefin selectivity depends on the exact hydrogenation activity of the available mild hydrogenation sites. Since only a few sites are available at this stage, the initial activity is restricted. Immediately after hydrocarbon synthesis has commenced, the catalytic behaviour changes because of the creation of additional sites. The activity increases when the new sites become available and the methane concentra- tion decreases because of the dilution of the almost constant amount of methane that is produced. The olefin selectivity may also change, depending on the exact hydrogenation activity of the additional sites and on the fraction of the surface sites that consists of methanation sites: secondary hydrogenation of olefinic primary products takes place mainly on methana- tion sites. This model does not attempt to be very specific. Details on the exact chemical differences between the two types of sites, and the nature of their hydrogenation strength, are not investigated at this point. This study aims specifically at unveiling something of the fundamentals of the hydrocarbon synthesis. Once basic relations are established in a qualitative way, the investigations will narrow in order to build a more specific and quantitative model which is associated with specific methods for measuring the various parameters involved. Experimental The catalysts used in this study were prepared by partial combustion of iron citrate complexes [7]. Ferric nitrate (mixed with the nitrate of other metals in the atomic ratio Fe/Me = 1 where appropriate) and citric acid were dissolved in distilled water, using 1 g-equiv of acid per g-equiv of metal. The solutions were concentrated under vacuum in a rotary evaporator at 333 - 353 K until the liquid was highly viscous. The contents were trans- ferred to a vacuum oven and maintained at 343 K for 12 h. Partial combus- tion of the dry material was achieved in static air at 673 K for 1 h. Surface analysis using Auger electron spectroscopy revealed spectra typical of those obtained with Fe203, but carbon was also present. Depth-profile analysis revealed that the surface layers contained carbon. The ratio C/Fe was close to 0.5 at the outer surface layer and fell to 0 at the fourth sub-surface atomic layer. Catalyst C-Fe is complex-derived iron, and catalysts C-FeCa, C-FeMn and C-FeAl contain additional calcium, manganese and aluminium respec- tively. In addition, a BASF ammonia synthesis catalyst was used. The catalyst precursors were crushed and screened to particle sizes in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 mm and reduced at a pressure of 300 kPa hydrogen at a flow- rate of 1.6 X 10~6 m3 s-' for 3 - 5 h at 433 K and subsequently for 16 - 20 h at 573 K or 663 K. The catalytic behaviour of the materials was evaluated in a fixed bed microreactor system [8] based on a concentric tube design [9]. The product 132 was analyzed by means of an on-line gas chromatographic data system [10 - 13]. The reaction conditions employed were 2.0 MPa pressure, temperature 543 K and flow (VHSV = 1000) of synthesis gas with a mol ratio HZ/CO = 0.5. Conversion of CO to hydrocarbons was ca. 10%. The rate of hydro- carbon synthesis was typically in the range 4 - 8 p.mol g~1 s~1. Results and discussion Methanation According to the model presented, only methanation sites are created in the first stage of reductive pretreatment. The rate of methane formation on these sites, rci(m)> is predicted to remain essentially constant during synthesis. Additional methane is formed on synthesis sites according to Anderson-Schulz-Flory statistics with a rate rci(s). This rate may vary with changing product statistics and catalyst deactivation. The observed rate of methane formation, rpi, is the sum total of the other two rates. The predictions are substantiated by experimental evidence. When ^\"01(8) ls calculated from Anderson-Schulz-Flory statistics, subtraction from rci yields rci(m). The calculations show that rci(m) remains constant during synthesis with catalyst C-Fe, while it changes only slightly with catalyst C-FeAl and BASF (Figs. 1 - 3). r^nm) was also found to remain constant with catalyst C-FeMn and other catalysts, r^nm) could not be calculated for C-FeCa because this catalyst did not yield a product spectrum that adhered to Anderson-Schulz-Flory statistics. Reduction studies using both temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and isothermal reduction indicated that under the pretreatment conditions used, catalyst C-Fe was fully reduced, while BASF and C-FeAl were only partly reduced. Figure 1 shows that full reductive pretreatment 100 200 300 400 500 Time on stream, ks Fig. 1.

Figure 2 suggests that a few additional methanation sites are created during further reduction of BASF. This catalyst deactivates rapidly under the conditions used, and a subsequent slight decrease in rci(m) (relative to the large decrease in the activity and rci(s)) is observed. The variations are so small that for all prac- tical purposes r^nm) can be considered to have a constant value. The degree of reduction of catalyst C-FeAl was very low before the catalyst was exposed to synthesis gas. Consequently a slight increase in rci(m) during synthesis is observed (Fig. 3). In all three cases, the curves suggest that the values of rci(ni) and r^i are initially identical and methanation is the only source of methane at the first moments of synthesis. In the model it is suggested that partly reduced catalysts exhibit high methane selectivity values, particularly during the first periods on stream. The suggestion is substantiated by Figs. 2 and 3, which show that almost half of all methane produced is due to methanation when the catalyst is only partially reduced in the pretreatment. Full reduction during pretreat- ment results in much higher synthesis activity, and the fraction of methane caused by methanation (over and above that predicted by Anderson-Schulz- Flory statistics) is much smaller (Fig. 1). Influence of the reduction temperature Two aliquots of catalyst C-FeCa were reduced at two different tem- peratures, one at 573 K and the other at 663 K. The overall activity, expres- sed as the rate of hydrocarbon synthesis (r^c), almost doubled (Fig. 4). This observation is in good agreement with results reported by Bell and Heine- mann [5], and in line with the presented model. The result also indicates that under the synthesis conditions used synthesis gas is not able to effect the same degree of surface reduction as that obtained with a more severe reductive pretreatment. The product distributions obtained with the two catalysts were very different (Fig. 5). The catalyst reduced at 573 K was only lightly reduced and yielded a product spectrum that differed from normal Schulz-Flory behaviour. The other catalyst showed a higher degree of reduction after being pretreated at 663 K and was characterized by a product distribution obeying Schulz-Flory statistics. Similar results have been obtained with cobalt boride catalysts [4]. It could be suggested that the deviating distri- butions are produced only on partially reduced sites. The olefin selectivity (expressed as the mass percentage alkenes in the - hydrocarbon fraction) of the deeply reduced catalyst was initially somewhat higher than that observed with the less severely reduced catalyst. However, after an initial period of ca. 130 ks on stream the same selectivity values were obtained with both catalysts (Fig. 6). This shows that after an initial period of change in the catalyst structure (further reduction, carbidi- zation and reoxidation), the average strength of the mild hydrogenation sites is the same for both catalysts. This supports the model which states 136 that under constant reaction conditions the average strength of these sites depends on the nature of the catalyst only. The methane selectivity (expressed as the mass percentage methane in the hydrocarbon product) of the more deeply reduced catalyst is significant- ly lower than that observed with the less severely reduced catalyst (Fig. 6). This also supports the model which states that the number of strong hydro- genation sites, once carbided, stays essentially constant. Methane is predicted to be produced mainly on these sites. The more deeply reduced catalyst has a much higher overall activity. Therefore, a constant methane production is predicted to result in a much lower methane concentration because of dilution, as is indeed observed experimentally. 100 80 6 60 >- U 40 111 _1 UJ (n 20 0 Fig. 6 CLOSED SYMBOLS T^g 573K OPEN SYMBOLS TREo\"663K 0 OLEFINS IN C^-Cg & METHANE -A 0 100 200 300 400 500 Influence of the reduction temperature on the selectivity of catalyst C-FeCa. Influence of reduction by synthesis gas Reduction by synthesis gas under synthesis conditions has been men- tioned several times in this paper, but so far no evidence for such reduction has been presented. In order to examine this point, catalyst C-Fe was used in synthesis without reductive pretreatment having been applied. Since iron oxide is not active in synthesis, any activity observed with an oxide indicates that at least part of the surface has been reduced. After exposure to synthesis gas, a low catalytic activity, which grad- ually increases, is observed (Fig. 7), indicating that reduction during syn- thesis does indeed take place. The value of /'ci(rn) &t times on stream >100 ks is maintained at 0.11 Jumol s~1 (g Fe)~1 for both the prereduced and the non-prereduced catalysts, showing that the number of methanation sites remains constant and is independent of the degree of reduction. The grad- ually increasing low level of activity indicates that the number of additional synthesis sites is increasing gradually, but is still lower than that of a pre- reduced catalyst, at least for a time on stream of up to 300 ks. Similar observations are reported for entirely different synthesis en- vironments. Dictor and Bell [6] studied iron catalysts in the liquid phase 137 100 200 300 400 500 Time on stream, ks Fig. 7. Influence of reductive pretreatment on the overall catalytic activity of catalyst C-Fe. in slurry reactors. For their system they also found that the synthesis rate with prereduced catalysts rises initially and after an induction period under reaction conditions it declines monotonically. Because they worked with different catalysts in a different environment, it is not surprising that a different activity and induction period were found. Similarities were also observed with catalysts that had not been prereduced. The results obtained from the liquid phase study showed a rapidly rising synthesis activity, similar to that found in this study. Both studies demonstrate that unreduced Fe203 is inactive for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. One difference between the two studies is an induction period of declining activity, which is observed in the liquid phase only. Dictor and Bell suggest that the induction period is associated with the reduction of Fe2C>3 to Fe304, which is also inactive, and that the activity arises from subsequent reduction to the metallic state. We interpret the absence of an induction period in our results to a rapid reduction of Fe2C>3 to Fe3C>4, which is in agreement with the TPR results using this catalyst, showing that the reduction of Fe2C>3 to Fe304 proceeds rapidly at 543 K. Our synthesis results are in line with reports by Reymond et al. [14 -16], who also did not observe an induction period. They carried out their experiments with synthesis gas having a Ha/CO ratio of 9. For such a high Ha/CO ratio, the reduction of Fe^Oy to Fe3C>4 will proceed very rapidly, with the consequence that the delay in the onset of synthesis activity will be eliminated. Although the Hz/CO ratio employed in our study is much lower, very rapid reduction of the catalyst precursor occurs because of the extremely high degree of dispersion of our catalyst. The olefin selectivity observed in the present study with the unreduced catalyst is slightly lower than that observed with the prereduced catalyst 138 100 OLEFINS IN Cz-Cs 80 40 NO STANDARD REDUCTIVE REDUCTIVE PRETREATMENT PRETREATMEN- METHANE 20 100 200 300 400 500 Time on stream, ks Fig. 8. Influence of reductive pretreatment on the selectivity of catalyst C-Fe. (Fig. 8). Since the total number of synthesis sites is lower on the catalyst that was not prereduced, this catalyst has a higher fraction of methanation sites. We suggest that secondary hydrogenation of olefinic primary products occurs mainly on methanation sites. When the fraction of methanation sites is higher, secondary hydrogenation increases and consequently a lower olefin selectivity is observed. The methane selectivity observed with the unreduced catalyst has a value which is about three times that obtained with the prereduced catalyst (Fig. 8). This ratio agrees well with the activity of the unreduced catalyst (Fig. 7), which is approximately one-third of that obtained with the pre- reduced catalyst. This correlation again supports the model. Summarizing the influence of the reduction temperature, it can be concluded that the activity increases with a simultaneous decrease in the methane selectivity (Fig. 9) when the reduction temperature increases, while / CKm) remains constant. Influence of reoxidation Having dealt with the question of further reduction of the surface, the next question considered is that of reoxidation. The model predicts that under mild oxidation conditions the number of synthesis sites will decrease. These sites have been defined as having reversible oxidation and reduction properties. As a consequence, a considerable fraction of the synthesis sites are predicted to be reoxidized, resulting in a significantly decreased overall activity. The number of methanation sites is predicted to remain constant, since these sites have already been exposed to synthesis. Consequently the value of '\"CKm) ls predicted to remain constant. However, since the number of synthesis sites decreases, the fraction of methanation sites relative to the total number of sites enlarges. Consequently, a very significant increase in 139 300 400 500 600 700 REDUCTION TEMPERATURE,K Fig. 9.

Catalyst C-FeMn was selected to investigate this point. After being on stream for en. 500 ks, the catalyst was reoxidized for a period of 2 ks by a stream of air (same space velocity as during synthesis) at 500 K and ambient pressure. It can be judged from Figs. 10 and 11 that the predictions from the model are supported by experimental evidence. 140 Conclusion The results from this study have shown that the extent of reduction of the surface has a major influence on the catalytic activity and selectivities. To account for the observations, a model has been proposed in which two types of catalytically active surface sites are postulated: methanation and synthesis sites. Methanation sites are the first sites to be formed during reduction of the oxidic catalyst precursor. Once exposed to synthesis gas, the number of these sites stays constant. The sites have a high hydrogenation activity and are only active in methane production. Further reduction of the surface results in the formation of additional sites, the number of which depends, inter alia, on the degree of prereduction and can be varied by means of reoxidation or further reduction. These sites have a lower hydrogenation activity than the methanation sites, and contri- bute to the synthesis of hydrocarbons according to Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. Because they contribute to hydrocarbon synthesis in general, the number of these synthesis sites has a major influence on the overall catalytic activity. Variations in the activity are associated with variations in the methane selectivity because the rate of methanation remains essentially constant. Depending on the ratio of methanation to synthesis sites, a considerable amount of methane can be produced over and above that predicted by Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. The model is based on two parameters only, the extent of reduction and the distribution of the hydrogenation strength of the surface sites. Several other factors may, for instance, affect the methane selectivity. With an increase in catalyst activity, the concentration of olefins in the products will increase, assuming that the flow rate of the gas is held constant. Olefins are known [17] to scavenge Ci precursors and thereby reduce the formation of methane. Another factor concerns surface carbidization. When iron oxide is reduced, small particles of iron form which are then slowly con- verted to iron carbide. The carbide is a poorer hydrogenation catalyst than the iron, and hence, as the carbide forms, one would expect the methane selectivity to decrease. Although the surface is known to be largely carbided under steady state synthesis conditions, no provision for an influence from that side is made in the model. Despite the fact that these effects are not included, and despite other limitations, it is remarkable how well the model describes the experimental observations, although it postulates the existence of two types of sites and the extent of surface reduction only. It can therefore be concluded that the concentration and the distribu- tion of the hydrogenation strength of the surface sites are important reasons for pretreatment-dependent catalytic behaviour. The aim of this study was to reveal such a relation in a qualitative way. The model is still very qualita- tive and, admittedly, rather vague in nature. However, we feel that this is a first step in unveiling the nature of the hydrocarbon synthesis. Future 141 studies will help to achieve a more detailed picture of the hydrocarbon synthesis, so that eventually the ultimate aim, a quantitative model, can be realized.

Box 217, 7500 AE EnschedeThe Netherlands The specific conditions of catalyst pretreatment are known to determine the properties of iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts to a large extent. The phenomenon has been investigated and it was found that the extent of reduction of the surface has a major influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity. Methane is formed as the main product on those sites that are the first to be reduced. Further reduction of the surface results in the formation of additional sites with a lower hydrogenation activity, contributing to the synthesis of hydrocarbons according to Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. The number of initial (methanation) sites, once exposed to synthesis gas, stays constant. In contrast, the number of additional (synthesis) sites depends, inter alia, on the degree of prereduction and can be varied by means of reoxidation or further reduction. Depending on the ratio of methanation to synthesis sites, a considerable amount of methane can be produced over and above that predicted by Anderson-Schulz-Flory product statistics. References 1 R.L.
