Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Korea University Seoul 02841 Republic of Korea Graphical abstract The oxidative coupling of methane using silica-supported Na2WO4 (Na2WO4/SiO2) catalysts is observed by adjusting additives in order to understand the roles of additives and to design more efficient catalysts. By observing the effects of additives on the catalytic OCM activity of Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts, the reducibility of metal additives, quantified by the standard reduction potentials, is observed to improve the methane conversion and olefin selectivity, indicating that the active sites of activating methane and dehydrogenating paraffin are identical. The supply of oxygen atoms from more easily reducible additives to tungsten oxide manipulate the OCM activity as described by the standard reduction potentials of the additives. The crystal and electronic structures of the catalysts depend on the additives, which can also be used to adjust the catalytic activity. Keywords Oxidative coupling of methane Additive Na2WO4 Standard reduction potential Olefin 1 Introduction Methane is a major component of natural gas, shale gas, and bio gas [1]. Although methane is abundant in nature, it has not been used as a source of more complex chemicals in many suggested value-adding applications but instead has been used as a fuel. Numerous studies have attempted to use methane to obtain chemical building blocks; however, the highly stable C–H bonds of methane suppress the direct chemical conversion of methane to more complex and valuable products, and the partial oxidation of methane to carbon monoxide has been utilized to produce more valuable compounds via further chemical conversion into valuable fuels and chemicals, including n-paraffins [2–4], hydrogen gas (water-gas-shift reaction) [5–7], and dimethyl ether [8–10]. The oxidative coupling of methane (henceforth OCM) is a promising means by which to convert methane into coupled hydrocarbon products of paraffins and olefins, which can be further valorized to fuels and chemicals [11]. The activation of methane molecules to form methyl radicals is required as the first step to produce coupled products by OCM. Methyl radicals are coupled in the gas phase to produce C2 or larger (C2+) paraffins, which can be further dehydrogenated to olefins [12–16]. Active catalysts are required to perform OCM; numerous catalysts have been developed for this process. In the early ages of OCM catalyst development, pure or modified metal oxides of groups IA, IIA [17–19], and several other oxides [20–26] were examined. Because the OCM reaction mechanism includes the activation of methane, highly basic oxides were considered as appropriate OCM catalysts [27,28], and complex reaction mechanisms were investigated using simple metal oxide catalysts [29,30]. Recently, the metal compositions of catalysts were adjusted using transition metals or rare earth metal oxides [26,31] and ionic components [32,33]. The basicity of the catalysts was increased [27,28] or decreased [32,33] to manipulate the OCM activity. The preparation conditions, including the calcination atmosphere [26] and/or the types of metal precursors used [34], were reported to affect the catalytic activity, while the reaction conditions were adjusted to improve the catalytic activity [35]. Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 (Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 or Mn-NW) catalyst is well known for high activity, high selectivity, and high stability [36,37]. In spite of its high activity, the OCM mechanism using Mn-NW remains not well understood. Na2WO4, Mn, and SiO2 have been recognized as an active component, an additive, and a support, respectively [38], but their roles as well are not fully understood [39]. The active component, Na2WO4, is a spinel crystal composed of layers of tetrahedral WO4 2− and interlayered Na+ ions [40]. The presence of the WO4 tetrahedron, with its appropriate geometry, is very important to achieve good OCM [41]. DFT studies to understand the complex surface reaction on the Mn-NW catalyst are also in progress [42,43]. Additives including Ce and La were examined [44,45]; the La additive was found to improve the OCM activity via its interaction with the active WO4 component. Noble metal additives are also reported to manipulate the catalytic activity in the same manner [46]. Because the melting temperature of bulk Na2WO4 (698 °C) is lower than the typical OCM reaction temperatures (700–900 °C), Na2WO4 must be in a liquid phase during the OCM reaction [47]. At such a high reaction temperature, Na+ penetrates through the silica support to induce a phase transition of silica to α-cristobalite SiO2, which has been attributed to the high OCM activity [48–50]. This phase transition suggests that the support material should be a part of the synergic interactions among the active components because the α-cristobalite SiO2 crystal structure is stable at temperatures exceeding 1500 °C, much higher than the OCM reaction temperature. The roles of the support were also studied using various support materials [51], including silica and silicon carbide [52–56]. Recently, the nature of the support was modified using metal dopants or metal oxides [57–60]. Mn has been described as an additive capable of conveying electrons to reaction systems [61,62], and OCM has been discussed in terms of the electron conductivity of catalysts [62]. Nonetheless, the roles of Mn additive remain not well understood. The goal of this study is to elucidate the effects of additives on the OCM activity of Na2WO4/SiO2. Several additives were added to Na2WO4/SiO2 and the OCM results were discussed to confirm their roles. Structural modifications were also discussed and the OCM reaction mechanism using metal or metal-oxide-added Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts was suggested. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials All chemicals were used as received without additional purification unless otherwise noted.

Silica gel support was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, Massachusetts). 2.2 Catalyst preparation Metal-added Na2WO4/SiO2 (Na2WO4:SiO2 = 5:93 (w/w)) catalysts with different additives were prepared by an impregnation method [58,59,63]. The molar ratios of (additive)/(Na2WO4) were 2.14 (mol/mol) for all additives, where the additives were counted as elements, not as oxides. The silica support was dispersed in water and stirred for 30 min. Na2WO4·2H2O and a metal precursor were added to the mixture and it was stirred for three hours. The mixture was then dried in air at 105 °C followed calcination in air at 800 °C for five hours. 2.3 Catalytic activity measurement OCM was performed using the continuous flow fixed-bed reaction system, as described in our previous studies (Fig. S1) [16,58,59,63]. The catalytic activity was measured using a packed-bed quartz I-tube reactor with an internal diameter of 6 mm and 250 mm of straight cylindrical tubing. The catalyst bed was placed between quartz wool in the middle of the reactor. Zirconia–silica ceramic beads, which are inert during the oxidative coupling of methane, and which exhibit low methane conversion (5.9%) and low O2 conversion (7.9%) at 800 °C, filled the remainder of the reactor volume. Methane, oxygen, and nitrogen were co-fed at the following volumetric ratio: (methane):(oxygen):(nitrogen) = 2:1:1. The flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers. The total flow rate was fixed at 30 mL/min, with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10,000 h−1. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in N2 flow at 700 °C for 60 min and then heated to the reaction temperatures of 700–850 °C. The reaction mixture, including CH4, O2, CO, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8, was identified with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). O2, CO, and CO2 were quantified using a TCD with a 60/80 carboxen-1000 packed column, and CH4, C2, and C3 hydrocarbons were analyzed using an FID with an Agilent 19091P-S15 column. Based on the reported stability of NW catalysts [37,58], the selectivity, conversion and yield were calculated based on the data collected at 0.5 h of time-on-stream. The preliminary test indicated that methane conversion, C2+ selectivity, and C2+ yield of Mn-NW exhibited values of deviation lower than 1.6%, 3.8%, and 2.5%, respectively, at 0.5–5 h of TOS, confirming the reliability of the catalytic activity value measured at 0.5 h of TOS. All results were collected three times and averaged; the final average exhibited less than 7% deviation (Fig. S2). Methane conversion (%) = (consumed moles of methane)/(initial moles of methane) × 100 Selectivity to CxHyOz = x × (produced moles of CxHyOz)/(consumed moles of methane) × 100 Yield of CxHyOz = x × (produced moles of CxHyOz)/(initial moles of methane) × 100 2.4 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization was carried out on a D/Max 2500-PC (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV and 200 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe X-ray photoelectron spectroscope at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan, Korea). The XPS spectra were calibrated using C 1s at 284.6 eV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 OCM activity of metal-added Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts The catalytic OCM activity of Na2WO4/SiO2, which was modified using different additives, was measured (Tables 1 , S1, and Fig. S2). Reaction results were measured three times for each catalyst and less than 7% deviation was observed (Fig. S2). Based on the yields of the C2+ compounds, including all coupled hydrocarbon products from methane, Mn-added Na2WO4/SiO2 (Mn-NW or Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2) produced the largest quantity of C2+ compounds, exhibiting a 19.5% C2+ yield. Zn-added Na2WO4/SiO2 (Zn-NW) exhibited the highest C2, C2+, and olefin selectivities among the metal-added catalysts, although the methane conversion in this case was 44% lower than that of Mn-NW. Compared to Na2WO4/SiO2 (NW), the Al, Li, La, Mg, Zn, and Cr-NW catalysts exhibited lower methane conversions, while the Cu, Ni, Co, Ce, and Mn-NW catalysts exhibited higher methane conversions. The addition of Cr, Cu, Ni, and Ce slightly increased the C2+ selectivity; this increase can be attributed to the high catalytic oxidation activity of their oxides, which produced CO and CO2 via the deep oxidation of methane [64–66]. Note that the oxygen and carbon balances of the catalysis results were measured for all catalysts; final results exhibited ranges of oxygen balance of 94.4–103.1% and carbon balance of 93.6–109.3%, confirming the reliability of the reaction results (Table S1). The OCM activity of metal additives in this study were also measured, revealing poor C2+ selectivity and indicating no preferred formation of C2+ hydrocarbons (Table S2). 3.2 Methane conversion depending on standard reduction potential Mn in the Mn-NW catalyst for OCM reportedly serves as a conveyer of active oxygen atoms to methane molecules, producing methyl radicals (CH3 ) [61,62]. This supports the assumption that the use of other metal additives, including Cu, Ni, Co, and Ce, can also be used tocontrol the supply of active oxygen atoms to the catalytic active sites and the formation of methyl radicals at the high OCM reaction temperature. Methyl radicals have been proposed as a key intermediate of catalytic OCM [67]. Furthermore, surface oxygen species in OCM catalysts are widely thought to be responsible for the activation of CH4, leading to the formation of methyl radicals [15]. For the metal or metal oxide additives in this study, their ability to supply active oxygen into the Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst system or to electronically modify the OCM reaction paths can be an indicator of the OCM catalytic activity. The electronic ability of metal additives was depicted using their standard reduction potentials, which exhibit a linear relationship with their electronegativity [68]. The standard reduction potentials, which are selected in the general oxidation state of each metal additive, were correlated with the measured catalytic activities in an effort to understand the results depicted in Table 1 (Figs. 1 and S2) [69]. Among the observed correlations of the methane conversion, C2+ selectivity, C2+ yield, olefin selectivity, and olefin yield with the standard reduction potentials of additives (Table S3, Figs. 1, and S3), the methane conversion exhibited a good linear relationship with the standard reduction potentials (Fig. 1). Methane conversion is governed by the elementary reaction of the oxygen-involved formation of methyl radicals, which are further converted to COx (CO and CO2) and coupled hydrocarbons [12–15]. For the oxides of metal additives, those whose standard reduction potentials are highly positive can release more oxygen species to form oxides composed of fewer cationic metal additives, improving the oxidation of methane. In contrast to these, those whose standard reduction potentials are highly negative may not easily release oxygen species, maintaining their initial oxidation states and not improving the oxidation reaction. We also note that metal additives supported on SiO2 without NW exhibited oxidation activity with low C2 selectivity (Table S2). These observations confirmed that the oxides of metal additives released active oxygen species at high reaction temperature. NW appears to utilize the released oxygen species for the selective oxidation of methane to coupled hydrocarbons. More about the roles of metal additives is discussed later with X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results. 3.3 Olefin selectivity depending on standard reduction potentials In addition to the linear relationship between methane conversion and the standard reduction potential of metal additive, research on the formation of C2+ compounds and olefins has revealed the roles of additives in the hydrocarbon selectivity. The olefin selectivity increased with an increase in the C2+ selectivity (Fig. 2 ), indicating that the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins may occur at the same catalytic active sites at which the formation of methyl radicals occurs. Although, in addition to the formation of methyl radicals, the selectivity of C2+ can be determined by the coupling of methyl radicals, the coupling of methyl radicals has been reported to occur in gas-phase reactions, which are less affected by catalysts [12–15]; the C2+ selectivity must therefore be highly dependent on the formation of methyl radicals. Observing the olefin selectivity with regard to the C2+ selectivity revealed that two groups of catalysts exist depending on the standard reduction potentials of the additives (Fig. 2). The group 1 catalysts, containing additives with highly positive or less negative reduction potentials, exhibited higher methane conversions (27.7–45.4%) and greater olefin selectivity. The group 2 catalysts, containing additives with highly negative reduction potentials, exhibited lower methane conversions (7.69–25.5%) and lower olefin selectivity. Interestingly, the correlation between the olefin and C2+ selectivities exhibited non-zero intercepts at C2+ selectivities of approximately 13% and 30% for the groups 1 and 2 catalysts, respectively. These observations indicate that the dehydrogenation of C2+ compounds occurs following the formation of a certain amount of C2+ compounds. Based on the standard reduction potentials (Table S3), we also note that the number of electrons that reduces the oxidized metal additives determines the C2+ selectivity. Except for the poor catalysts of Al, Li, and the La-NWs, which will be discussed later, Mg and Zn additives exhibiting two-electron reduction exhibited higher C2+ selectivity of 57.8–69.7%. Cu, Cr, Ce, Co, and Mn additives exhibiting one-electron reduction exhibited lower C2+ selectivity of 24.7–43.0%. Because multi-electron reduction can be assumed to be kinetically more difficult, additives exhibiting two-electron reduction can supply methane with fewer oxygen atoms, which may suppress the vigorous additional oxidation of methyl radicals to COx, thus increasing the selectivity to methyl-radical-coupled C2+ compounds. The Ni additive with two-electron reduction exhibited lower C2+ selectivity, most likely because of the good oxidation activity of NiO catalysts [70,71]. Note that these correlations were also observed when the methane conversions were not significantly different (Table S4 and Fig. S4). 3.4 Crystal structures The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts revealed additive-driven variation of the crystal structures and correlation of those structures with the catalytic activity (Fig. 3 ). While both fresh and spent catalysts were observed (Figs. 3 and S5), the spent catalysts, although not in-situ, used at 700–850 °C are selected for the discussion in this study because they better represent the catalysts that are utilized at high OCM reaction temperatures. The formation of α-cristobalite SiO2 was observed for all spent catalysts except for Li-NW, which exhibited the formation of quartz SiO2 with no α-cristobalite. While the formation of α-cristobalite SiO2 is widely used to indicate good OCM activity of Mn-NW catalysts [48], the fusion of Na+ to SiO2 and the stabilization of WO4 2− have been attributed to the formation of α-cristobalite SiO2 and good OCM activity, respectively [41]. Based on the reported benefits of α-cristobalite SiO2 for OCM, the poor OCM activity of Li-NW can be attributed to the absence of α-cristobalite SiO2 [72]: smaller Li+ ions are more easily absorbed into SiO2, suppressing the fusion of Na+ ions. La-NW, a poor OCM catalyst, exhibited the formation of sodium-lanthanum-tungsten oxide, as observed via the diffractions at 2θ = 26–30° (JCPDS No. 79-1118) [44,73,74], indicating that La and active tungsten oxide formed a mixed oxide. In addition to the formation of α-cristobalite SiO2, use of the good catalyst Mn-NW led to the formation of MnWO4 [38], while crystals of NaWO4 were still clearly observed. No other catalysts exhibited the formation of mixed oxides composed of additives and tungsten. While most of the catalysts exhibited a slight change of the α-cristobalite SiO2 unit cell volume with the slightly shifting diffraction peaks, Al-NW exhibited the greatest increase of the peak shift (2θ = 21.99–21.81° for (101) diffraction) to a larger volume, providing evidence of the formation of Si-Al mixed oxide. The poor activity of Al-NW can be attributed to the inclusion of Al in the silica structure and the absence of surface Al as an additive. 3.5 Electronic structures The electronic structures of the spent catalysts were observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at room temperature (Figs. 4 , S6, and S7). The binding energy of W 4f7/2 was observed at 34.39–35.01 eV depending on the additives while that of Na2WO4/SiO2 without additives was 34.64 eV. While the relations between catalytic activity and W 4f7/2 binding energy did not exhibit any significant dependence, methane conversion exhibited a weak relation with W 4f7/2 binding energy (Fig. 4) because the methane conversion was strongly dependent on the standard reduction potentials of the metal additives (Fig. 1). W 4f7/2 binding energies of group 1 catalysts were 34.39–34.78 eV and those of group 2 catalysts were 34.70–35.01 eV. Although no dependence was clearly observed, it appears that the better oxidation catalysts (group 1) exhibited a lower binding energy, or a higher electron density of W; the worse oxidation catalysts (group 2) exhibited higher binding energy, or lower electron density of W. As observed for the standard reduction potentials (Fig. 1 and Table S3), metal additives with highly positive standard reduction potentials (group 1) easily release oxygen species, which can add more oxygen atoms to the environment of W, decreasing the W 4f binding energy. Compared to this, metal additives with highly negative standard potentials (group 2) do not easily release oxygen species, and the environment of W is not significantly manipulated with more oxygen atoms, which increase W 4f binding energy. The weak dependence observed in Fig. 4 demonstrates the oxidation activity of NW catalysts adjusted by the electronic structures of metal additives and NW. In addition to the methane conversion, C2+ selectivity was also slightly dependent on the W 4f7/2 binding energy (Fig. S7). Group 1 catalysts containing metal additives with highly positive standard reduction potentials and W with lower electron density exhibited lower C2+ selectivity and lower olefin selectivity. Group 2 catalysts containing metal additives with highly negative standard reduction potentials and W with higher electron density exhibited higher C2+ selectivity and higher olefin selectivity. These observations indicate that the reducibility of metal additives, or the easy release of oxygen species from oxides of metal additives, improved the methane conversion at the expense of C2+ and olefin selectivity, although improved olefin selectivity compared to C2+ selectivity was observed (Fig. 2). 4 Conclusion The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of metal additives in Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The standard reduction potentials of additives were used to understand the roles of additives, and it was found that the reduction ability of the additives significantly affected the C2+ selectivity, olefin selectivity, and methane conversion of OCM catalysts. In other words, the metal or metal oxide additives performed the activation of methane molecules to methyl radicals and the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins by their oxygen conveying ability. When metal additives with highly positive standard reduction potentials were used, higher methane conversion and greater olefin selectivities were observed, indicating that the oxygen species, more easily released from the oxides of metal additives, added to the environment of W, decreasing the electron density of W and improving the activity of oxygen on NW. The best additive, Mn, was among the metals exhibiting the highest standard reduction potential. Based on the observations in this study, better additives (based on their reduction capabilities) are under study to improve the efficiency of the OCM process.
