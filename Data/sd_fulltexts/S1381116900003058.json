Lavrentieva 5, 630090, Novosibirsk, Russia * Corresponding author Phosphorous-doped VO x /TiO2 catalysts prepared by the spray-drying method and treated under catalytic reaction, as well as individual phases (αI-, αII-, β-) of VOPO4 were studied using modern high-resolution solid-state NMR techniques, including fast magic angle spinning (MAS), combined with the analysis of rotational satellites intensities by the satellite transition spectroscopy (SATRAS) method; 2D triple-quantum, quintuple-quantum MAS NMR, and spin mapping echo experiments. The simultaneous determination of chemical shielding anisotropy and quadrupole tensor parameters, as well as their distributions, permits to draw a conclusion on the local environment of vanadium sites in the catalysts. The formation of a triple V–P–Ti compound in phosphorous-doped VO x /TiO2 catalysts has been revealed. Only one type of slightly distorted tetrahedral vanadium atoms bound via oxygen to phosphorous was found in this compound. The very large distribution of the quadropole constant points to the irregular structure of this compound. Keywords Vanadium Phosphorous Titanium oxide Solid-state NMR SATRAS MQMAS Spin mapping echo 1 Introduction VO x /TiO2 catalysts used in industry (reviews in Refs. [1,2] and references therein) usually contain various additives, and among them, phosphorous is one of the main. Nevertheless, the influence of the phosphorous on the structure of the catalysts is not obvious. Only few publications are devoted to the study of VO x /TiO2 catalysts promoted by phosphorous [3–9]. Soria et al. [3] noticed the interaction of phosphoric acid, not only with the vanadium species deposited on the outer part of the titania support, but also with the surface TiO2 layers. The resulting vanadium and titanium phosphates were found to be strongly influenced by the phosphorous content. Deo and Wachs [4] have found by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) that the effect of P2O5 on the surface vanadium oxide phase depends on the concentration and sequence of preparation. Upon addition of higher concentrations of P2O5 (when the P/V ratio in the catalysts is greater than 1.25), vanadium phosphate compound (αI-VOPO4) is formed, which appears to have vanadium–oxygen–phosphorous bonds with the surface phosphorous oxide phase. Whereas, the addition of 1% V2O5 to a 5% P2O5/TiO2 does not show any evidence of vanadium phosphate compound formation. The changing of the sequence of impregnation of phosphorous and vanadia on titania suggests that phosphorous oxide does not discriminate between the TiO2 surface, or the surface of vanadium oxide phase interacts strongly with both of them. Hengstum et al. [5] have concluded, from the results of the catalytic oxidation experiments, that the addition of phosphorous resulted in an increase of the surface acidity of VO x /TiO2 catalysts. Alyea et al. [6] have found that phosphate addition to the titania support, prior to vanadia addition, resulted in the formation of only octahedrally coordinated vanadia species and slightly decreased the interaction between vanadia and titania. Overbeek et al. [7] have concluded that the oxide phase is amorphous and very well dispersed over the surface of the support in the case of titania-supported vanadium–phosphorous oxide catalysts prepared via deposition–precipitation from a homogeneous solution of low valent vanadium ions in combination with phosphate-ions onto titania support bodies. It was also found that the active phase exhibits a very strong interaction with the titania support. Spectroscopy data for V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, modified by different amounts of P2O5 (P/V ratios of 0–3.3) prepared by impregnation in the presence of oxalic acid, showed that the addition of P2O5 favours the formation of supported vanadyl phosphate and isolated V4+ species [8]. EXAFS analysis of titania-supported V–P–O catalysts (∼8 wt.% V), prepared by means of homogeneous deposition–precipitation, revealed structural differences between the V–P–O phases in these catalysts and bulk V–P–O catalysts. It was also found that vanadyl phosphate is not the active phase in this reaction [9]. It is clearly seen that the method of catalysts preparation, relative concentrations of vanadium and phosphorous, and the procedure of the additive introduction, should be critical. Nevertheless, even for the catalysts prepared by similar ways, there are some discrepancies in the determined structures. In the present study, the influence of phosphorous addition on the structural properties of VO x /TiO2 catalysts, prepared by the spray-drying method, was investigated by modern solid-state 31P and 51V NMR techniques. Whereas 31P NMR, which permits to distinguish the oxidation state of vanadium in the system [10–13] and discriminate between different VOPO4 phases [11,13–17], nowadays is most practical in application to the study of vanadia–phosphorous systems, 51V NMR became one of the most informative methods for the characterisation of the local environment of solid-state vanadia-based catalysts [18–23]. New NMR techniques permit one to extract precisely all the parameters of chemical shielding and the quadrupole tensors (including the relative orientation of tensors) that determined solid-state NMR line shape. Among these techniques are: satellite transition spectroscopy (SATRAS), which is the variant of high speed magic angle spinning (MAS) with the precise analysis of the intensity of spinning sidebands [24–29]; and high-resolution multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) spectroscopy [30–39]. Under some suitable experimental conditions, these techniques may be used for the description of the local environment of the nuclei and its distortions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation VOPO4·2H2O was prepared as described in Refs. [40–42] by heating V2O5 with 85% H3PO4 (P/V=7) under reflux for 16 h. Pure VOPO4 phases were prepared from VOPO4·2H2O, according to [43]: αI-VOPO4 — was obtained by dehydration of VOPO4·2H2O in dry air at 250°C, αII-VOPO4 — was prepared from VOPO4·2H2O by dehydration in dry air at 720°C for 20 h, and β-VOPO4 — was obtained by heating of αII-VOPO4 at 800°C for 5 h. The assignment of the phases formed in the course of the preparation and the purity of individual compounds was checked using powder XRD (Siemens D-500 diffractometer, monochromatised CuK α radiation). The VO x /TiO2 catalysts, promoted by phosphorous (20 wt.% V2O5, 0–15 wt.% P2O5), were prepared by the spray-drying method, including the mixing of aqueous solutions of vanadyl oxalate, TiO2 (anatase) and H3PO4, followed by subsequent drying and calcinations, as described in Ref. [44]. Before NMR measurements, catalysts were used in the ammoxidation of methylpyrazine reaction (methylpyrazine/O2/NH3/H2O=1/8/17/17 (vol.%), the rest being N2, at 250–350°C). The soluble surface compounds were extracted by washing in 2M·HNO3 and water at ambient temperature with subsequent drying and calcination [18]. 2.2 NMR measurements NMR measurements were performed on Bruker MSL-400 and CXP-300 spectrometers in magnetic fields of 9.4 and 7.0 T, corresponding to a 51V resonance frequency of 105.20 and 78.86 MHz and to a 31P resonance frequency of 161.9 and 121.4 MHz, respectively. The 31P and 51V chemical shifts were referenced to external 85% H3PO4 and VOCl3, respectively. High-speed MAS 51V and 31P NMR spectra were recorded at rotation frequencies 10–15 kHz using 5 mm (outer diameter) Si3N4 rotors and the NMR probe from NMR Rotor Consult. (Denmark). The 31P spin echo mapping spectra [10–13] were recorded under static conditions, using a 90°x–τ–180°y–τ pulse sequence. The 90° pulse was 4.0 μs and τ was 20 μs. The irradiation frequency was varied in increments of 50 kHz. Two-dimensional (2D) 3Q- and 5QMAS 51V NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature. The standard acquisition scheme, consisting of preparation, evolution and detection periods, was used [30–32]. The length of the first 120° preparation pulse was 3.67 μs. Second refocusing pulse was 1.38 μs (45°) for 3QMAS experiments and 1.98 μs (65°) for 5QMAS experiments, respectively. The spectra were recorded with a recycle delay of 5 s. The phase of the first pulse was cycled in such a way to pick out the desirable multiple-quantum coherence. This pulse cycling was combined with a classic overall four-pulse cycle scheme, in order to minimize phase and amplitude receiver imperfections. 51V NMR spectra parameters were determined from MAS rotational sidebands intensities using the SATRAS approach [24–29]. Simulations of both 51V static and MAS NMR spectra were performed, taking into account the second-order quadrupole correction using the NMR5 program described earlier [45–47]. All simulations were performed on a dual PII-400 MHz CPU IBM PC compatible computer running Linux OS. 3 Results and discussion According to the literature data [10–13], 31P NMR spin echo mapping is a powerful technique to analyse the oxidation state of vanadium bound to phosphorous atoms. The signal at 2400 ppm is typical for phosphorous linked via oxygen to V4+ in (VO)2P2O7. Similar signals are at 2300 ppm in VO(H2PO4)2, at 1625 ppm in VOHPO4·0.5H2O, and at 800 ppm in VO(PO3)2. The signal near 0 ppm is typical for phosphorous bound via oxygen to V5+ in VOPO4 phases. The intermediate signal between 200–1200 ppm corresponds to phosphorous bound to both V4+ and V5+. For VPO4 (phase in the V3+ oxidation state), the 31P NMR spin echo mapping signal is observed at 4600 ppm. The 31P NMR spin echo mapping spectra of VO x /TiO2 catalysts, promoted by phosphorous, represent a single line with chemical shift close to 0 ppm (Fig. 1A) . According to the literature data, this indicates that practically all vanadium, bounded via oxygen to phosphorous, should have the oxidation state V5+ in these catalysts. These data are in agreement with ESR. According to these data, only 1–2% of vanadium in these catalysts is in the 4+ oxidation state. This is untypical for the binary V–P catalysts, in which the active phase is represented by a matrix of (VO)2P2O7 with a low density of V5+ species on its surface, while in binary V–Ti catalysts, the main part of vanadium is V5+. A close examination of the 31P NMR signal near 0 ppm by 31P MAS allowed one to discriminate between the VOPO4 phases in V–P systems [11,13–17]. In αI-, αII-, β-, δ- and γ-phases of VOPO4, vanadium has the oxidation state 5+ and according to Abdelouahab et al. [15], only one signal at −20.5 ppm is observed in 31P MAS for αII-VOPO4 and one signal at −11.5 ppm for β-VOPO4, correspondingly. Only one line was detected in the 31P MAS spectrum of αI-VOPO4 at 3.6 ppm [16]. The spectra of the δ-VOPO4 and γ-VOPO4 are more complex. γ-VOPO4 shows two signals at −17.3 and −21.2 ppm with the same relative intensity and a shoulder at −14.9 ppm. δ-VOPO4 has two signals at −8.4 and −17.6 ppm and a weak peak around −6.5 ppm [15]. αI-, αII-, δ- and γ-phases of VOPO4 can be easily hydrated. The VOPO4·2H2O dihydrate is the final product of hydration for all the phases. Its 31P MAS spectrum has only one signal at 7.6 ppm [16]. 31P MAS spectra of VO x /TiO2 catalysts, promoted with different phosphorous concentrations, are shown in Fig. 1B. All the catalysts show a single peak at −30 ppm different from those for all (αI-, αII-, β-, δ-, γ-) VOPO4 phases or their hydrated forms. Note that 31P NMR signals from −20 to −40 ppm for the VOPO4 catalysts, exposed under reaction conditions, was attributed by Vedrine et al. [17] to the interaction between VOPO4 groups and (VO)2P2O7. The absence of the latter phase in our system eliminates this possibility in our case. Thus, the observed 31P signal at −30 ppm in VO x /TiO2 catalysts promoted by phosphorous could not be attributed to any VOPO4 phases or their hydrates. The high-filed shift of this signal allows to propose that phosphorous in the catalysts is bound via oxygen, not only to vanadium (5+), but also to titanium atoms. Combined 31P NMR spin echo mapping and 31P MAS data indicate that phosphorous in the promoted VO x /TiO2 catalysts is not bound to V4+ or V3+, but only to V5+, and, more probable, simultaneously to Ti4+. Actually, the identification of the V5+ phases present in V–P catalysts by 31P MAS NMR is difficult, due to their amorphous character, which, probably, could increase their 31P NMR line width. To achieve a better characterisation of the catalysts, it is also necessary to examine their 51V NMR spectra. 51V static and MAS NMR spectra of VO x /TiO2 catalysts promoted by phosphorous with different phosphorous concentration are shown in Fig. 2 . All the spectra represent the superposition of two lines: the line with axial anisotropy of the chemical shielding tensor (σ ⊥=310 ppm, σ ∥=1270 ppm) and the line with the maximum at −800 ppm. At low phosphorous concentrations, the line with the axial anisotropy of the chemical shielding tensor prevails in the spectra (Fig. 2A-1,2). The increase of the phosphorous content leads to the increase of the intensity of the line at −800 ppm (Fig. 2A-2,3,4), and with the phosphorous content close to 15wt.% of P2O5 (molar ratio of V2O5/P2O5≅1), the latter line became the main in the spectrum (Fig. 2A-4). MAS NMR spectra of the same catalysts are shown in Fig. 2B. As could be seen, the line with axial anisotropy of chemical shielding tensor gives well-resolved spinning sidebands. The isotropic shift of this line (−612 ppm), its anisotropy, as well as all quadrupole tensors parameters for this spectrum, well coincide with those for V2O5 [24,27]. The line with the maximum at −800 ppm does not narrow under MAS conditions. One of the reasons of such behaviour may be related to the amorphous character of the catalysts. So, the actual identification of V–P compounds in this case could be successful only in case of the detailed knowledge of all NMR parameters for VOPO4 phases, including the influence of some NMR parameters distribution on the resulted line shape. Quantitative integration shows that up to 50% of the vanadium is not detected in the spectrum of catalysts with very low phosphorous contents and could be revealed only after acidic extraction of the excess of regular V2O5 as has been shown in Ref. [18] for pure VO x /TiO2 catalysts obtained by the spray-drying method. Based on the precise analysis of both static and MAS spectra [18], the authors have revealed a unique vanadium site with an extremely large quadrupole coupling constant (up to 15 MHz). This site is presumed to be the strongly bound vanadium (SBV) incorporated into the titania lattice with a significantly distorted octahedral oxygen environment. The introduction of phosphorous decreases the content of the SBV species, and in the catalysts with 15 wt.% of P2O5, SBV species were not detected after the extraction procedure (Fig. 2B-4). The 31P and 51V NMR spectra of the VO x /TiO2 (10 wt.% P2O5), after extraction of the soluble vanadium and phosphorous species, are almost the same as observed before the extraction (compare spectra 2,3 and 4 in Fig. 2B). The latter indicates that all vanadium atoms in the catalysts with high phosphorous concentrations are bound to phosphorous and that the compound formed is not soluble in the acidic solution. There are several publications devoted to 31P NMR spectra of VOPO4 phases, whereas only Abdelouahab et al. [15] published 51V NMR spectra of (αII-, β-, δ-, γ-) phases of VOPO4. Unfortunately, neither chemical shielding tensor parameters nor quadrupole constants were determined in the above-mentioned paper. Moreover, authors have demonstrated only a small part (1/4) of both static and MAS spectra of VOPO4 phases. The spectra with axial anisotropy of the chemical shielding tensor presented in this paper could be more or less useful for researcher, whereas the spectrum of αII-VOPO4 could only be imagined with the rich fantasy of the reader. That is why we have to determine the complete set of parameters of the chemical shielding and quadrupole tensors for the individual compounds, whose presence could not be excluded in our catalysts. Moreover, as it was mentioned in the introduction, the formation of (αI-, αII-, β-) VOPO4 and VOPO4·2H2O was proposed by several authors for VO x /TiO2 catalysts promoted by phosphorous. The VOPO4 phases are composed of VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra [48–55]. The octahedra are distorted and exhibit a short vanadium–oxygen bond (VO) and a long vanadium–oxygen bond (VO). The other four oxygen atoms may be considered as equatorial atoms. The VO equatorial bond length is intermediate between short and long bonds. The VO6 octahedra in (αI-, αII-, β-) VOPO4 phases form chains with alternating short and long vanadium–oxygen bonds. The VO6 octahedra are linked to PO4 tetrahedra in the direction perpendicular to the main chain direction. The β-VOPO4 phase differs from others by two oxygen atoms of each PO4 tetrahedron shared with two octahedra belonging to the same chain, while the other two oxygen atoms of the PO4 tetrahedron are shared with octahedra from different chains. In (αI-, αII-) VOPO4, oxygen atoms from any PO4 tetrahedron are shared with octahedrons from different chains. The V–Oequatorial–P links are all identical for αI-VOPO4, while in β-VOPO4, there are three different kinds of V–Oequatorial–P links with different angles. The main difference between αI-VOPO4 and αII-VOPO4 structures is the inversion in position of the vanadium and phosphorous atoms relative to the equatorial plane: V and P are on the same side for αI-VOPO4 and on the opposite sides for αII-VOPO4. The VO short bond never intersects the equatorial plane. The 51V NMR parameters obtained in our experiments are in good agreement with the structural data for αI-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 mentioned above (Table 1 , Figs. 3 and 4 ). Thus, the axial chemical shielding anisotropy observed for these compounds is typical for vanadium in distorted octahedral environments, with one short vanadium–oxygen bond. Large value of anisotropy indicates a very short VO bond. The significant shift of the isotropic chemical shielding to higher fields up to 700–800 ppm results from the PO4 surrounding the vanadium. In contrast, the NMR parameters obtained for αII-VOPO4 are absolutely different (Table 1, Fig. 5 ). While for αI-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 phases, the 51V chemical shielding tensors are close to axial; the chemical shielding tensor for αII-VOPO4 has three significantly different principal values. This difference may be due to a longer VO bond in this compound. The latter could also be due to a smaller value of the anisotropy for αII-VOPO4 in comparison to αI-VOPO4 and β-VOPO4 phases. According to the structural data for αII-VOPO4, all equatorial VO bond lengths are very close (from 1.857 to 1.858 A). The short VO bond is longer than in the other phases and has a length of 1.578 A. For example, in β-VOPO4, the equatorial VO bonds vary from 1.853 to 1.9023 A; the VO bond is equal to 1.565 A. Different values of quadrupole constants in these phases are probably caused by the position of vanadium and phosphorous atoms close to the equatorial plane. According to the literature data [43], the structure of VOPO4·2H2O resembles that of α-VOPO4. The only difference is that the long VO bonds in VOPO4·2H2O are replaced by VOH2 bonds, and there is no chain structure. This fact significantly influences the 51V NMR spectra, which are significantly broadened by the exchange of H2O molecules, and line narrowing is not observed in MAS experiments. Based on both 51V and 31P NMR data, we may conclude that the VOPO4 phase does not exist in the phosphorous-promoted VO x /TiO2 catalysts prepared by the spray-drying method. According to a small value of 51V chemical shielding anisotropy, vanadium atoms in these catalysts should be in slightly distorted tetrahedral coordination. The high value of the isotropic chemical shielding (800 ppm) unambiguously evidences that the vanadium atoms are bound to phosphorous via oxygen atoms. The single signal at −30 ppm in 31P MAS spectra for the catalysts with different phosphorous concentrations indicates that all phosphorous atoms are bound to vanadium (according to 51V NMR data, vanadium is bound to P), and that there is no phosphorous bound only to TiO2 surface (as was proposed in the literature data). Nevertheless, taking into account the ability of phosphorous to easily interacts with both vanadium and titanium, one may suggest that in the promoted VO x /TiO2 catalysts, obtained by the spray-drying method, phosphorous is bound simultaneously to titanium and vanadium. There is another argument in favour of this suggestion. According to the data obtained by the Differential Dissolution technique [56], vanadium, phosphorous and titanium in these catalysts are dissolved simultaneously with a constant ratio close to 1:1:1. The latter could be only the case if an individual V–P–Ti compound is formed in these catalysts. The interaction between all the components in the system is favoured by the catalyst preparation procedure, according to which, an interaction of vanadium and phosphorous occurs with freshly precipitated sediment precursor of TiO2, Ti(OH)4·nH2O, but not with crystalline TiO2 usually used for catalyst preparation. To clarify the structure of the formed V–P–Ti species, 2D 3QMAS and 5QMAS methods have been applied for the catalyst characterisation. The MQMAS experiments lead to a higher spectral resolution, as compared to that obtained in conventional MAS experiments. Moreover, MQMAS gives the possibility to determine the distribution of chemical shielding and quadrupole tensor parameters. The latter information is very important for the characterisation of the long-range environments of 51V nuclei. 2D 3QMAS and 5QMAS spectra of V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, containing 10% P2O5 are shown in Fig. 6 . Two axes (F2 and F1) in these spectra correspond to the single-quantum (1Q) and triple-quantum (3Q) or quintuple-quantum (5Q) dimensions, respectively. The parts per million scales of the 2D spectrum are calculated with respect to ν o for the F2 dimension and 3ν o or 5ν o for the F1 dimension. The projection of the 2D spectrum on the F2 axis produces the conventional 1Q spectrum with some shape distortion due to imperfections in the rf pulses and in inter pulse delays. According to these spectra, only one type of vanadium site is formed in the catalyst with an isotropic chemical shift near −755 ppm, with a very large distribution of quadropole constant (∼7 MHz in both directions) around its mean value of about 17 MHz. 5QMAS spectrum is more suitable for the discrimination between the quadrupole and chemical shielding parameter distributions than the 3QMAS spectrum. As could be seen from the 5QMAS spectrum, the distribution of quadrupole parameters significantly affects the observed spectrum, while the influence of chemical shielding distribution is less pronounced. According to this observation, we may conclude that the vanadium sites in the V–P–Ti compound formed are probably in slightly distorted tetrahedral coordination, whereas there are the strong distortions (different for each vanadium site) in the second coordination sphere. This points to the irregular structure of this compound. 4 Conclusion Phosphorous-doped VO x /TiO2, catalysts prepared by the spray-drying method and treated under catalytic reaction, as well as individual phases (αI-, αII-, β-) of VOPO4 were studied using modern high-resolution solid-state NMR techniques, including fast MAS, combined with the analysis of rotational satellites intensities by the SATRAS method; 2D triple-quantum, quintuple-quantum MAS NMR and spin mapping echo experiments. The simultaneous determination of chemical shielding anisotropy and quadrupole tensor parameters, as well as their distributions, permits to draw a conclusion on the local environment of vanadium sites in the catalysts. The formation of a triple V–P–Ti compound in phosphorous-doped VO x /TiO2 catalysts with the ratio of V:P:Ti close to 1:1:1 has been revealed. Only one type of slightly distorted tetrahedral vanadium atoms bound via oxygen to phosphorous was found in this compound. The very large distribution of quadrupole constant points to the irregular structure of this compound.
