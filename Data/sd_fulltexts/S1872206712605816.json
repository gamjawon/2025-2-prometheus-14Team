The XRD and XPS measurements revealed that the oxidation treatment helped to imâ€� prove the dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, but their metallic state was retained, which enhanced CO oxidation. In contrast, the surfaces of the Pt nanoparticles were dominated by PtO2 after the oxidaâ€� tion treatment, which lowered the CO oxidation activity compared with that of the reduced Pt cataâ€� lyst.

Keywords: Perovskite oxide Silver Platinum Redox treatment Structural modification Carbon monoxide oxidation Â Â 1. Introduction Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have important applications in heterogeneous catalysis because of their unique crystal strucâ€� tures and chemical properties. Perovskite oxides can be directâ€� ly used to catalyze many reactions, e.g., BaMO3 (M = Pb, Bi, Sn) for catalytic combustion of methane [1], LaMO3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) for oxidation of propylene [2], and LaCoO3 for CO oxidaâ€� tion [3]. The A and B sites in the ABO3 structure can both be partially substituted by other cations to form A1â€�xA'xB1â€�yB'yO3âˆ’Î´ (A' = noble metal, B' = transition metal) composite oxides, which show excellent performances in many catalytic reacâ€� tions. For instance, LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 [4] and LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 [5] catalysts are used in automotive emissions control, and LaMO3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) [6] and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3âˆ’Î´ [7] catalysts give high performances in solâ€� idâ€�oxide fuelâ€�cells. Making use of their high chemical and therâ€� mal stabilities, these oxides can be used as supports for highâ€�temperature catalytic reactions, e.g., Pt/La0.7Sr0.2Ce0.1FeO3 [8] and Pt/La0.5Ce0.5MnO3 [9] catalysts in leanâ€�deNOx reaction, and Ag/LaMnO3 [10] and Pd/LaMnO3 [11,12] catalysts in the total oxidation of methane. In perovskiteâ€�based catalysts, the surface structure of the catalyst depends sensitively on the pretreatment conditions. The chemical composition, atomic structure, and chemical state of the catalyst surface often exhibit dynamic changes in various gaseous environments. Among many pretreatment conditions, reduction and oxidation are the most frequently used processâ€� * Corresponding author.

Catal., Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2013 GAO Kang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 889â€“897 es. The redox pretreatments affect the surface structure and, thus, the activity of the catalyst. Changes in the catalyst strucâ€� ture in response to various redox pretreatments may help in understanding the mechanisms of catalyst activation and deacâ€� tivation [13,14]. For example, Nishihata et al. [4,5] have proâ€� posed â€œintelligentâ€� catalysts, in which perovskite LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 and LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 catalysts were sucâ€� cessfully used in automotive emissions control. When the cataâ€� lysts were subjected to oxidizing conditions, noble metal atoms were incorporated into the perovskite lattice, and the activity decreased significantly. In contrast, the noble metal ions segâ€� regated on the oxide surfaces to form metal nanoparticles unâ€� der reducing conditions, accompanied by an increase in the activity. During the reaction, the catalysts were subjected to alternating oxidation and reduction conditions, and the noble metal underwent reversible structural changes between metal cations in the oxide lattice and metal nanoparticles on the oxide surface, which prevented the sintering of metal particles and achieved selfâ€�regeneration of the catalysts. Scott group studied the treatmentâ€�structureâ€�reactivity relationships of BaCe0.95â€� Pd0.05O3 catalysts [15,16]. They found that Pd atoms were doped in BaCeO3 lattice after oxidation treatments, which proâ€� duced a large number of oxygen vacancies in the oxide and enhanced CO oxidation activity. Under reducing conditions, Pd segregated on the surface to form nanoparticles, which caused a decrease in the CO oxidation activity. The Nishihataâ€™s group and Susannahâ€™s group have demonstrated opposite dependâ€� ences of reactivity on redox treatments in perovskiteâ€�based catalysts, and the difference has not been explained very well. Here, we studied the structure and CO oxidation activity of Pt and Ag catalysts supported on perovskite oxides. Opposite deâ€� pendences of the catalytic performance on the redox treatment was observed for the perovskiteâ€�supported Pt and Ag catalysts. Based on structural investigations, the different structural changes in the supported Pt and Ag catalysts in response to the redox treatments were used to explain their different catalytic behaviors. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation BaTiO3 (BTO)â€�supported Pt and Ag catalysts were prepared using a solâ€“gel method [17]. Typically, 2.0 g of BaCO3 were disâ€� solved in glacial acetic acid in a molar ratio of 1:10. In parallel, appropriate amounts of titanium(IV) butoxide, acetylacetone, and butanol in molar ratios of 1:2:5 were mixed to form a uniâ€� form solution. The BaCO3 solution was added dropwise to this solution, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 1 h. Then, 1 ml of 0.5 mol/L AgNO3 or 1 ml of 0.5 mol/L H2PtCl6Â·6H2O soluâ€� tion was added to the obtained solution and stirred at 50 Â°C. The resulting gel was dried at 100 Â°C for 10 h in an oven, and then calcined in air at 800 Â°C for 2 h. The obtained samples were designated as oxidized samples (M/BTOâ€�Oxidized). The reduced samples (denoted by M/BTOâ€�Reduced) were obtained by heating the oxidized samples in H2 at 800 Â°C for 2 h. The reduced samples were calcined in air at 800 Â°C for 2 h, producâ€� ing the reoxidized samples (M/BTOâ€�Reoxidized). CaTiO3 (CTO)â€�supported metal catalysts were prepared usâ€� ing a similar solâ€“gel method [18]. Tetrabutyl titanate, Ca(NO3)2, and citric acid were dissolved in anhydrous ethanol and disâ€� persed ultrasonically. Then 1 ml of AgNO3 solution (0.5 mol/L) or H2PtCl6Â·6H2O solution (0.5 mol/L) was added to the mixâ€� ture. Using the same drying and calcining processes, the oxiâ€� dized samples were obtained (M/CTOâ€�Oxidized). Reduced (M/CTOâ€�Reduced) and reoxidized samples (M/CTOâ€�Reoxiâ€� dized) were obtained using the same processes as for the M/BTO samples. In all the catalysts, the molar ratio of Ag or Pt to the oxide support was set at 0.05. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Xâ€�ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed usâ€� ing a Rigaku D/MAXâ€�RB Xâ€�ray diffractometer with Cu KÎ± radiaâ€� tion (Î» = 0.15418 nm), operated at 40 kV and 200 mA at room temperature, with a scanning rate of 5Â°/min. Xâ€�ray photoelecâ€� tron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out using a VG ESCALAB MK2 instrument with an Al Ka excitation source (hÎ½ = 1486.6 eV). The analyzer mode was set at a constant pass enâ€� ergy of 20 eV. 2.3. Catalyst activity CO oxidation was carried out in a laboratoryâ€�built fourâ€�channel microreactor, in which four samples can be evalâ€� uated in parallel. The products were analyzed using an online sixâ€�channel mass spectrometer (Omnistar GSD 301 O2&GSS 300). The reaction gas consisted of 1% CO, 20% O2, and 79% He. The gas hourly space velocity was calculated to be 12000 ml/(gÂ·h). The catalytic performance was evaluated using a temperatureâ€�programmed reaction process, with the reaction temperature ramped from room temperature to 300 Â°C at a ramping rate of 1 Â°C/min. For quantitative analysis of the CO conversion, one of the four channels was kept empty to have reference signals from the input reactants [19]. The bed temâ€� perature when the CO conversion reached 90% is denoted by T90. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structural change of Ag/ABO3 catalysts with redox treatments The structural changes in the BTOâ€� and CTOâ€�supported Ag catalysts with cyclic oxidation and reduction treatments were investigated using XRD (Fig. 1). The XRD patterns for the BTO and Ag/BTO samples are shown in Figure 1A. Diffraction peaks from the cubic BTO structure are clearly visible in each pattern (JCPDS 86â€�1570), suggesting that a wellâ€�crystallized perovskite structure was obtained using the solâ€�gel method. After the oxiâ€� dation and reduction treatments, the patterns of all Ag/BTO samples show obvious peaks of metallic Ag (2Î¸ = 38.2Â°, 44.5Â°, 64.5Â°; JCPDS 01â€�1167), and no diffraction peaks from Ag2O are observed. In addition, the main BTO peaks have not shifted in GAO Kang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 889â€“897 the Ag/BTO samples compared with the pure BTO sample, indicating that the Ag species are present in the sample in the form of supported nanoparticles, not as a dopant. Figure 1(b) shows similar results for the Ag/CTO system, in which metallic Ag also remains as particles on the oxide surface. Quantitative analysis of the Ag(111) diffraction peaks shows that the fullâ€�width at halfâ€�maximum (FWHM) of the peak beâ€� comes smaller when the oxidized sample is reduced in H2 for 2 h at 800 Â°C. After the second oxidation treatment, the FWHM of the Ag(111) peak increases again. These changes suggest that the crystallite size of the Ag nanoparticles varies with the oxiâ€� dationâ€�reduction treatments. For the Ag/BTOâ€�Oxidized sample, the crystallite size of Ag is calculated to be 33 nm, using the Scherrer equation; this increases to 47 nm after the subsequent reduction process. Finally, it decreases again to 32 nm after the second oxidation. The BTOâ€�supported Ag nanoparticles thereâ€� fore undergo a dispersionâ€�aggregationâ€�redispersion process in the oxidationâ€�reductionâ€�reoxidation treatments. For the Ag/CTO sample, the calculated particle size changes from 34 to 56 to 33 nm during the oxidationâ€�reductionâ€�reoxidation proâ€� cess, which indicates that the Ag nanoparticles supported on CTO surfaces are subject to similar dispersionâ€�aggregationâ€� redispersion changes. Our previous studies have shown that highâ€�temperature oxidation treatments of Ag catalysts result in dispersion of Ag nanoparticles on SiO2 supports, whereas reduction treatments in H2 at high temperatures induce aggregation of Ag nanopartiâ€� cles [20]. The present results are similar to those observed in our other work. We suggest that Ag nanoparticles are oxidized to form highly dispersed Ag oxide structures in the initial oxiâ€� dation stage. At higher oxidation temperatures, the surface Ag oxides decompose and produce metallic Ag nanoparticles. The oxidationâ€�decomposition process occurring in the oxidation treatment therefore helps to improve the dispersion of Ag naâ€� noparticles. In contrast, Ag nanoparticles continue to aggregate during the reduction process, which results in a continuous increase in the Ag particle size. Figure 2 shows the Ag 3d XPS spectra of Ag catalysts supâ€� ported on BTO and CTO, treated under different conditions. After the oxidation and reduction treatments, the Ag 3d5/2 binding energies of all the Ag/BTO samples remain at 368.3 eV, which is from metallic Ag [21,22]. In contrast, the Ag 3d peak intensity changes significantly with the treatment. The reduced sample has a much lower intensity than the oxidized samples. Quantitative analysis shows that the ratio of Ag 3d and Ti 2p peak areas (Ag 3d/Ti 2p) changes from 17.32% for the oxidized sample to 7.29% for the reduced sample. After further oxidaâ€� tion, the Ag 3d/Ti 2p value increases to 10.12%. The XPS reâ€� sults show that the highâ€�temperature reduction leads to aggreâ€� gation of Ag particles, so the Ag 3d intensity becomes lower. This result is consistent with the above XRD data (Fig. 1(a)). For the Ag/CTO samples, similar XPS results were observed in the redox treatment process (Fig. 2(b)). The XRD and XPS measurements both demonstrate that Ag species were well dispersed on the surfaces of BTO and CTO under oxidizing conditions. After reduction at high temperaâ€� tures, the dispersed Ag nanoparticles aggregated significantly. Further oxidation treatment caused redispersion of the Ag naâ€� noparticles.

Structural changes in Pt/ABO3 catalysts with redox treatments Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of Pt catalysts supported on BTO and CTO, and treated under various conditions. Peaks from the cubic BTO structure are clearly visible in each pattern (Fig. 3(a)). The lattice parameters and cell volume of the perâ€� ovskite oxides are the same as those of the pure BTO sample. The patterns for the Pt/BTO samples show obvious diffraction peaks of metallic Pt (2Î¸ = 39.8Â°, 46.2Â°, 67.4Â°; JCPDS 04â€�0802). No diffraction peaks from PtO x crystallites are observed. The FWHM of the Pt(111) diffraction peaks of all the samples do not show any significant changes. The Pt crystallite sizes, calculated using the Scherrer equation, are all around 35 nm for the oxiâ€� dized, reduced, and reoxidized samples. Figure 4 displays the Pt 4f XPS spectra of Pt catalysts supâ€� ported on BTO and CTO, and treated under various conditions. The Pt 4f7/2 peak acquired from the Pt/BTOâ€�Oxidized sample can be deconvoluted into two component peaks at 71.8 eV and 75.4 eV, which are assigned to metallic Pt and PtO2, respectiveâ€� ly [23,24]. In this spectrum, the component at 75.4 eV is domiâ€� nant, indicating that the surface of the Pt nanoparticles is mainly composed of Pt oxide. After the subsequent reduction, the Pt 4f7/2 binding energy appears at 71.8 eV, which suggests that the particle surface has been reduced to metallic Pt. Upon reoxidation, the Pt 4f7/2 spectrum is again dominated by the PtO2 signal. Quantitative analysis of the peak intensity shows that the peak area ratios of Pt 4f and Ti 2p are 10.4%, 10.8%, and 8.3% for the Pt/BTOâ€�Oxidized, Pt/BTOâ€�Reduced, and Pt/BTOâ€�Reoxidized samples, respectively. The dispersion of Pt nanoparticles is therefore almost the same after the different treatments. These results are consistent with the XRD analysis (Fig. 3). Accordingly, it can be concluded that for the Pt/BTO and Pt/CTO catalysts, PtO2 is the major surface Pt species unâ€� der oxidation conditions, and the surface Pt remains metallic after reduction. In all the treatments, the size of the Pt nanoparâ€� ticles did not obviously change. 3.3. CO oxidation activity Figure 5 shows the catalytic activities of Ag catalysts supâ€� ported on BTO and CTO in CO oxidation. Pure perovskite oxides are almost inert in the reaction. Ag loading substantially inâ€� creases the CO oxidation activity. For the Ag/BTOâ€�Oxidized catalyst, T90 is observed at 245 Â°C. After reduction, the activity shows an apparent decrease, with T90 at 295 Â°C. Reoxidation results in full recovery of the activity. For the Ag/CTO catalysts, the CO oxidation behavior shows similar changes in activity with the treatment conditions. Forni et al. reported that metalâ€� lic Ag and Ag + species in Sr0.9Ag0.1TiO3Â±Î´ catalysts played an important role in the combustion of methane [25]. Rossetti et al. found that the activity in the catalytic combustion of meâ€� thane of an LaCoO3â€�supported Ag catalyst increased with deâ€� ceasing Ag nanoparticle size [26]. Metallic Ag nanoparticles therefore play a key role in catalytic oxidation reactions for perovskiteâ€�supported Ag catalysts. Based on the XRD and XPS characterization results, we have shown that the redox treatâ€� ment can change the dispersion of perovskiteâ€�supported Ag nanoparticles.

GAO Kang et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 889â€“897 improved dispersion of the Ag catalysts. Figure 6 shows the catalytic activity of Pt catalysts supportâ€� ed on BTO and CTO. For the Pt/BTOâ€�Oxidized sample, T90 is 240 Â°C. After reduction, the CO oxidation activity apparently increases, and T90 is lowered by 60 Â°C; the second oxidation decreases the activity again (T90 = 237 Â°C). CO oxidation over the Pt/CTO catalysts exhibit similar results to those with the Pt/BTO catalysts (Fig. 6(b)). It has been well documented that metallic Pt is the active species in CO oxidation reactions. The reduction treatment produces metallic Pt, as shown by XRD and XPS measurements, and thus it can be expected that the performances of reduced Pt/ABO3 samples will be better than those of the oxidized ones. 4. Conclusions Perovskiteâ€�supported Ag and Pt catalysts showed reversible structural changes and oxidation catalysis performances during cyclic oxidation and reduction treatments. For perovâ€� skiteâ€�supported Ag catalysts, the highâ€�temperature oxidation treatment induced dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, which enâ€� hanced the CO oxidation activity compared with that of the catalyst after highâ€�temperature reduction treatment. For perâ€� ovskiteâ€�supported Pt catalysts, the size of the Pt nanoparticles was almost unchanged in the redox treatments. The active meâ€� tallic Pt structure dominated the Pt particle surface under reâ€� duction conditions, whereas oxidation produced surface Pt oxide structure, lowering the CO oxidation activity.

The CO oxidation reactions over the Ag and Pt catalysts showed that the oxidized Ag/oxide catalysts performed better in CO oxidation than the reduced ones did, whereas the reduced Pt/oxide catalysts had higher CO oxidation activity than that after oxidation treatment. The XRD and XPS measurements revealed that the oxidation treatment helped to improve the dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, but their metallic state was retained, which enhanced CO oxidation.

Pt纳米粒子表面化学状态随氧化-还原处理的调变是导致表面催化活性差异的主要原因.
