Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Greetings from the Editorial Office of J Energy Chem. This year marks the sixth anniversary of Journal of Energy Chemistry (J Energy Chem). We would like to take this opportunity to reflect on the evolution of our journal and look forward to another fruitful year of 2019. Mission Dating back to 2013, J Energy Chem was renamed from its previous appellation, “Journal of Natural Gas Chemistry” to evolve with the advancing next-generation-energy research. With the world pursuing renewable and clean energy to replace the traditional fossil fuels, J Energy Chem reaches out to the involved scientific communities. To date, J Energy Chem has extended its scope to various energy-related fields, including but not limited to (1) electrochemistry, (2) solar energy, (3) biomass, (4) H2 and CO2 and (5) fossil. Overview Recalling the scientific publications in 2018, electrochemistry remained at the core of the journal with half of the published articles originating from this subject. Our most read and cited article in this year was the review on MXene-based materials for electrochemical energy storage by Zhou et al. [1]. Along with this paper, we published three “Special Topics” namely, “Graphene and 2D Materials for Energy Storage” [2], † † Note. For the Special Issues/Topic, cited paper is the starting paper in the issue/topic. “Flow Battery” [3] and “Energy Electrochemistry” [4], which were organized to cover the progress in the corresponding areas. In 2019, we will embrace the lithium–sulfur batteries family and publish a Virtual Special Issue (VSI) in this regard. The year 2018 was also the year of solar energy for J Energy Chem. We started from scratch and published two “Special Topics” on photovoltaics, “Perovskites: A New Era for Photovoltaics” [5] and “Photovoltaics from Chemistry-Materials-Physics and Sunlight” [6]. Including the unsolicited articles, this area occupied roughly a quarter of our contents. In 2019, we will continue to be active in this area and organize the VSI of “Organic Solar Cells.” We will also emphasize the area of clean energy with regard to the catalysis systems for water splitting and CO2 reduction [7]. A high-quality “Special Topic” on this direction will be organized, and unsolicited papers with high scientific significance are always welcome. Fossil energy has always been the main melody of J Energy Chem ever since its official launch in 1992. We would be glad to consider submissions regarding the cutting-edge technologies or scientific breakthrough in this field. Changes As the journal editors, we keenly feel that it is our responsibility to improve the publishing process. Starting from 2019, J Energy Chem will begin the article-based publishing (ABP), through which the articles will be published without needing to wait until a journal issue is complete. This step will speed up the publication process by an average of 7 weeks. The first ABP article [8] has been published in Vol. 34, 2019, with the immediately assigned page numbers 1–9. We believe that you will gain a pleasant experience with regard to the improved submission, peer review, and publication processes in our journal. Announcements We are delighted to welcome Prof. Chang Yu of Dalian University of Technology and associate Prof. Jianmin Ma of Hunan University as the new members of our editorial committee. Both have already been highly active J Energy Chem authors and advisors for years. In 2019, J Energy Chem will continue its search for international advisors. Candidates who are currently active in the energy-related fields and willing to increase the visibility of J Energy Chem in the international scientific community are encouraged to send us their curriculum vitae. Finally, on behalf of the editorial board members, the managing editors of J Energy Chem: Dr. Lijuan Zhang, Ping Yu, and Dr. Yang Gao would like to thank all the authors, reviewers, and readers, who have contributed to the success of J Energy Chem.
