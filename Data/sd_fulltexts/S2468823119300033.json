Graphical abstract Pd complex-catalyzed Sonogashira-coupling was studied in aqueous media and micelle formation related to the reaction is characterized by DOSY-NMR and electron micrograph. Sonogashira-coupling of 4-iodoanisole with 4-methylphenylacetylene was conducted in the presence of Pd(II) catalyst, NEt3, CuI and sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS) in aqueous media. The reaction catalyzed by PdCl2(Me2NCH2CH2NMe2) (2b) at 80 °C affords 4-methoxyphenyl-4′-methylphenylalkyne in 51% yield after 2.0 h, whereas those catalyzed by the complexes with other ethylenediamine derivatives, PdCl2(R2NCH2CH2NR2) (RH, C2H5, C3H7, C4H9, and C6H13), formed the product in lower yields (18–26%). Aqueous solution of complex 2b (5.3 mM) and SDS (168 mM) forms a yellow colloidal solution, which is stable for one night at room temperature. The complexes of ethylenediamines with higher alkyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms do not form apparently homogeneous solutions. TEM (transmission electron micrograph) observation of the former solution ([2b] = 5.3 mM), layered on a copper grid surface, revealed formation of Pd-containing micelles with diameters of ca. 4.0–6.0 nm A mixture of 2b (5.4 mM), 4-iodoanisole (125 mM) and 4-methylphenyl acetylene (250 mM) in water contains micelles with diameters smaller than 40 nm, as is clearly observed by TEM. Mixtures of the other complexes and the substrates contain micelles with larger sizes, and their TEM images are obscure. Thus, complex 2b forms small and clear micelles containing the catalyst and the substrate in the reaction mixture, and the micelle formation enhances the reaction in aqueous media. Keywords Coupling reaction Surfactant Palladium(II) catalysis 1 Introduction Synthetic organic reactions are mostly conducted in organic solvents. Aqueous reactions in organic synthesis are of current attention partly because of advantage in safety and heat dispersion, specially, in the case of large scale reaction. Another expected merit is high concentration of the substrates confined in micelles composed of organic compounds and/or surfactants. Cross-coupling reactions provide useful means for formation of new CC bonds. Sonogashira reaction of aryl halides with alkynes is promoted by Pd catalyst. It is well known as the reaction to provide a CC bond between sp 2 and sp carbon atoms, but there have been few alternative reactions, reported so far [1]. Sonogashira reaction does not require water-sensitive organometallic substrates, such as organomagnesium and organoaluminum reagents, and is expected to proceed smoothly even in aqueous media. Several research groups already reported Sonogashira reaction in aqueous media. Bhagwat reported the reaction using Pd/C as the catalyst of aqueous Sonogashira reaction [2]. He proposed transfer of the organic substrates from micelles to catalyst surface. Cai and Iranpoor independently reported aqueous Sonogashira reactions using PdCl2 as the catalyst in the presence of common surfactants or 1,3,5-triazines with three long alkyl substituents [3,4]. They observed formation of metallic palladium with nanometer-size by reduction of PdCl2 in aqueous media with the surfactants. The reactions do not require addition of CuI, although the reaction in organic solvents normally needs addition of Cu(I) salt to enhance it [5]. The reaction without addition of CuI is one of the characteristic using the metallic palladium as the heterogeneous catalyst. On the other hand, the homogeneous reaction catalyzed by Pd complexes in aqueous media was also reported. Lipshutz reported the reaction catalyzed by Pd(II) complexes with phosphine ligands in the presence of a neutral phase transfer surfactant, (PTS) to form the aryl alkyne products smoothly [6]. Aqueous reaction using PTS is reported also Mizoroki-Heck reaction, which also does not require organometallic reagents of main group elements as the substrates [7]. Woo surveyed the catalysis using Pd complexes with bulky monophosphines in the presence of surfactants such as CTAB, Triton X-100, and SDS [8]. In this study, we used common Pd(II) complexes with chelating dinitrogen ligands with various substituents on the coordinating nitrogen atoms as the catalyst, and observed micelles formed in the reaction mixture. We focused on anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), to stabilize the micelle containing the organic substrates inside because it is expected to bind the Pd complexes in the micelle via hydrophobic interaction between the surfactant and the organic ligand and via direct coordination of the surfactant to the Pd center, as depicted in Scheme 1 . 2 Results and discussion Palladium(II) complexes with ethylenediamine derivatives, PdCl2(R2NCH2CH2NR2) (2a: R = H; 2b: R = CH3; 2c: R = C2H5, 2d: RCH2CH2CH3; 2e: R = CH2(CH2)2CH3; 2f: RCH2(CH2)4CH3), were prepared from the reaction of the ligand, R2NCH2CH2NR2 (1a: R = H; 1b: R = CH3; 1c: R = C2H5, 1d: RCH2CH2CH3; 1e: R = CH2(CH2)2CH3; 1f: RCH2(CH2)4CH3), with H2PdCl4 (2a), PdCl2 (2b, 2c) and PdCl2(cod) (1d, 1e, 1f). The obtained complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy [9]. 1H NMR spectrum of 2b contains a single signal for N−CH3 hydrogen at 2.83 ppm, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). It suggests that chelate ring undergoes inversion between two gauche conformations with the rate higher than the NMR time scale. Complex 2d, however, show two pairs of signals for N−CH2 hydrogens and CH2-Me hydrogens at 1.81 and 2.42 and at 2.72 and 3.19 ppm, respectively (Fig. 1(b)). The bulky N-substituents retards the inversion of the chelate ring significantly. The X-ray crystallography revealed the structure of complex 2d in the solid state. Coordination around Pd(II) center is deformed significantly, as shown in Fig. 2 . PdN2 plane is tilted from PdCl2 plane by 33° probably because of steric repulsion between Cl ligands and four propyl groups at the coordinating nitrogen atoms. Thus, introduction of bulky substituents on the nitrogen atoms changes coordination structure around the metal center, and forms the molecule whose coordination differs largely from ideal square-planar structure for Pd(II). The different structures of the Pd complexes depending on the N-substituents may influence relative reactivity of the complexes in the catalytic reactions. Scheme 2 summarizes reagents, catalysts and coupling reactions of iodoarenes with aromatic alkynes (Sonogashira coupling) in aqueous media of this study. The reaction was conducted by adding CuI and NEt3, similar to the reaction in organic solvents. CuI was believed to promote the reaction as mediator of the alkynyl group, and NEt3 was used to scavenge HI generated from the reaction mixture. The reaction of 4-iodoanisole (IA, 0.50 mmol) with 4-methylphenylacetylene (IIa, 1.00 mmol) was conducted by adding complex 2b (0.016 mmol), CuI (0.016 mmol), NEt3 (7.18 mmol) and SDS (0.50 mmol). Reaction profile is shown in Fig. 3 (a). Yield of coupling product, 1-methoxy-4-(4-tolylethynyl)benzene (IIIAa), attained 51% after 2 h. The Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions of IA with para-substituted arylalkynes (IIb; Z = C4H9, IIc; ZF) were conducted under the same conditions with IIa (Z = Me), and the corresponding coupling products (IIIAb, IIIAc) were obtained in 34 and 58% yield, respectively. The reaction of 2-iodoanisole (IB) with IIa also proceeded with 64% yield of the product (IIIBa). Thus, this system is applicable in a variety of combinations of the substrate. Similar reactions in non-aqueous media, NEt3-SDS and NEt3, proceeds much more slowly, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). The results in Fig. 3 suggest that the reaction in aqueous media occurs more effectively those in SDS-NEt3 and in NEt3. It can be attributed to that the aqueous reaction occurs within micelles formed in the mixture. Complexes with longer alkyl groups on the coordinating nitrogen atoms are expected to show higher hydrophobicity and to influence the catalytic activities. Fig. 4 compares results of the reactions using Pd complexes 2a-2f as the catalysts. The reaction catalyzed by complex 2b in aqueous media produces the coupling product in the highest yield (51%) under the conditions. The reactions catalyzed by other complexes in aqueous reactions form the product in 18–26% yields. Each complex shows lower catalytic activity in NEt3 solution than in aqueous media containing SDS surfactant, although the reaction catalyzed by complex 2a in aqueous media forms the product in similar yield to that in NEt3 (18% and 15%). In order to obtain further insights for the catalysis, we analyzed the solutions of the complexes under several conditions. Solutions of the complexes in aqueous solutions are stable in the presence of added SDS. The solutions of 2a and 2b continue to be yellow solution after one night at room temperature (Fig. 5 ). The Pd complexes, 2c, 2d and 2e, are not dissolved in aqueous solution of SDS. They are partially dissolved after standing one night, which forms yellow solution. Mixing 2f with SDS in aqueous media caused separation of a solid containing SDS and Pd complex to leave colorless solution (Fig. 5(f)). Influence of concentration of SDS to the colloidal particles was studied by using DOSY NMR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6 . Diffusion constants were obtained from drift of the peaks due to 2b and SDS, and they were lowered by increase of concentration of SDS in the region of [SDS] <50 mM. The solutions with [SDS] = 50–166 mM show similar diffusion constants of the substances, indicating that the micelles formed in the mixture are stable and have the constant averaged diameters. Micelles formed in the solutions were analyzed by TEM after dropping a solution on a grid surface. A solution of complex 2b and SDS contains micelle particles smaller than diameter of 6 nm (Fig. 7 (a)). The solution of the reaction conditions with added IA and IIa showed clear images of micelle particles with larger size (Fig. 7(b), 20–40 nm). Similar solutions of complexes 2a, 2c, and 2d gave obscure spots due to micelles with larger sizes (diameter 40–70 nm, Fig. 7(c)–(e)). A solution containing 2f has Pd-containing particles of the diameter of 400 nm (Fig. 7(f)). Fig. 8 shows results of Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) measurement of micelles of 2b. Compounds containing Pd and I including the catalyst and the aromatic iodide and/or ammonium iodide are contained inside of the micellar particles. Thus, complex 2b forms stable micelle particles in the aqueous solutions containing SDS as the surfactant. In the absence of the organic substrates, the particle size is larger than 6 nm diameter. The solution containing excess amounts of the substrates form the particles with 20–40 nm diameter. Other complexes than 2b do not form the micelle particles that were observed as clear images in TEM measurement, and result in the particles with obscure boundary and larger sizes. This clear difference of the complexes for forming micelle ability in the absence and presence of the organic substrates is correlated to higher catalytic activity for the Songashira coupling reaction in aqueous media. In summary, we observed micelles formed in the reaction mixture of Sonogashira coupling catalyzed by Pd-diamine complexes. Complex 2b, with N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine, catalyzed the reaction more efficiently than the complexes with longer alkyl groups on the coordinating nitrogen atoms, in spite of expected higher hydrophobicity than 2b. Micelle particles of the reaction mixture were characterized by NMR and TEM. The results suggested that a mixture of complex 2b and the substrates forms micelles with smaller size than the other complexes and that it is related to higher stability of the micelle particles and higher catalytic activity than the reaction mixture of other catalysts. 3 Experimental procedure 3.1 General N,N,N’,N’-Tetramethyethylenediamine (1b), dipropylamine, dibutylamine, dihexylamine, sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS), 4-iodoanisole (IA), 2-iodoanisole (IB), 4-ethynyltoluene (IIa), 1-butyl-4-ethynylbenzene (IIb), 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene (IIc), 4-methylstylene, triphenylbenzene were purchased from TCI.

The mixture was stirred at 80 °C under Ar atmosphere for 2 h. An aliquoted sample was analyzed by 1H NMR and the yield of coupling product was determined based on the signal intensity of methoxy hydrogen at ca. 3.8 ppm. The NMR data of the products were matched with the literature [16]. 3.5.1 Synthesis of 1-methoxy-4-(4-tolylethynyl)benzene (IIIAa) 4-Iodoanisole (IA) (117 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 4-ethynyltoluene (IIa) (117 mg, 1.0 mmol) were reacted according to the general procedure, which afforded 1-methoxy-4-(4-tolylethynyl)benzene (IIIAa) in 51% NMR yield. 3.5.2 Synthesis of 1-methoxy-4-((4-butylphenyl)ethynyl)benzene (IIIAb) 4-Iodoanisole (IA) (117 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 1-butyl-4-ethynylbenzene (IIb) (158 mg, 1.0 mmol) were reacted according to the general procedure, which afforded 1-methoxy-4-((4-butylphenyl)ethynyl)benzene (IIIAb) in 34% NMR yield. 3.5.3 Synthesis of 1-methoxy-4-((4-fluorophenyl)ethynyl)benzene (IIIAc) 4-Iodoanisole (IA) (117 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene (IIc) (120 mg, 1.0 mmol) were reacted according to the general procedure, which afforded 1-methoxy-4-((4-butylphenyl)ethynyl)benzene (IIIAb) in 58% NMR yield. 3.5.4 Synthesis of 1-methoxy-2-(4-tolylethynyl)benzene (IIIBa) 2-Iodoanisole (IB) (118 mg, 0.50 mmol) and 4-ethynyltoluene (IIa) (116 mg, 1.0 mmol) were reacted according to the general procedure, which afforded 1-methoxy-2-(4-tolylethynyl)benzene (IIIBa) in 64% NMR yield. 3.6 Mizoroki-Heck reaction in aqueous media To an aqueous solution of SDS (144 mM, 3 mL, 0.17 mmol) was added 4-iodoanisole (IA, 117 mg, 0.50 mmol), Et3N (1.0 mL), and 4-methylphenylstylene (118 mg, 1.0 mmol), 2b (0.016 mmol), triphenylbenzene (internal standard, 43 mg, 0.14 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 80 °C under Ar atmosphere for 2 h. The crude product was analyzed by 1H NMR. The signal of the coupling product, however, was not detected. 3.7 X-ray crystallography The single crystal for X-ray crystallographic analysis was obtained by slow diffusion of Et2O into a CH2Cl2 solution of 2d.

The reaction catalyzed by PdCl2(Me2NCH2CH2NMe2) (2b) at 80 °C affords 4-methoxyphenyl-4′-methylphenylalkyne in 51% yield after 2.0 h, whereas those catalyzed by the complexes with other ethylenediamine derivatives, PdCl2(R2NCH2CH2NR2) (RH, C2H5, C3H7, C4H9, and C6H13), formed the product in lower yields (18–26%). Aqueous solution of complex 2b (5.3 mM) and SDS (168 mM) forms a yellow colloidal solution, which is stable for one night at room temperature. The complexes of ethylenediamines with higher alkyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms do not form apparently homogeneous solutions. TEM (transmission electron micrograph) observation of the former solution ([2b] = 5.3 mM), layered on a copper grid surface, revealed formation of Pd-containing micelles with diameters of ca. 4.0–6.0 nm A mixture of 2b (5.4 mM), 4-iodoanisole (125 mM) and 4-methylphenyl acetylene (250 mM) in water contains micelles with diameters smaller than 40 nm, as is clearly observed by TEM. Mixtures of the other complexes and the substrates contain micelles with larger sizes, and their TEM images are obscure. Thus, complex 2b forms small and clear micelles containing the catalyst and the substrate in the reaction mixture, and the micelle formation enhances the reaction in aqueous media.",
