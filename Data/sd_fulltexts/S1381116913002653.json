Graphical abstract A novel ionic complex with insensitivity to moisture and air, bis-[1-butyl-2-diphenylphosphanyl-3-methylimidazolium]tetrachloridorhodium(III) hexafluorophosphate (1A), has been synthesized and fully characterized. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 1A is composed of the Rh(III)-complex cation and the counter-anion of PF6 −. The complex cation has highly symmetrical RhIII-centered octahedron geometry with four Cl atoms in the equatorial plane and two imidazolium-substituted phosphine ligands in the axial position. The catalytic performance of 1A, which could be tailored by the ligands and the solvents, was investigated toward the biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene. It was found that the presence of the hemilabile hybrid P,N-ligand of 3 (1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-2-diphenylphosphino-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate), as a kind of ligand-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs), could dramatically spur the catalytic activity of 1A. The use of the RTIL of [PEmim]BF4 (1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as the solvent not only fulfilled the efficient biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene, but also guaranteed the successful recovery and recycling of the ionic compositions of 1A and 3. Keywords Biphasic hydroformylation Ionic complex Rhodium complex Phosphine Functionalized ionic liquid 1 Introduction Hydroformylation of olefins is a well-known atom-economical CC bond-forming reaction for the straightforward production of aldehydes; moreover it is one of the most important applications of homogeneous catalysis in industry as well [1]. Rhodium complexes have been examined as the most effective homogenous pre-catalysts for hydroformylation as they display high activity and selectivity and their catalytic performance can be tailored by using specially designed ligands. Hence, a large number of rhodium complexes and ligands have been developed and applied to this reaction [2–4]. To spur the activity and selectivity of rhodium complexes, varieties of ligands such as monodentate and bidentate phosphorous-based ligands [3–9], and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) [10–12] have been synthesized by finely tuning theirs electronic and steric properties. And the hybrid P,O- or P,N-bidentate ligands with multiple ligations to the rhodium complex represent a very promising class of ligands for hydroformylation [13–18]. However, difficulties in separation workup and catalyst deactivation still are the big challenges. More efforts have been devoted to the developments of catalytic systems that allow facile separation of the products from catalysts and enable catalyst to be recycled [19]. Aqueous/organic biphasic catalysis [20–22] and fluorous biphasic catalysis [23] are well-known methods for effective catalyst separation and recycling. But low solubility of higher olefins (>C6) in water has limited the scope of aqueous/organic biphasic hydroformylation. In the past decade, as an alternative polar medium for hydroformylation of higher olefins, room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) have been proven to be useful in terms of improving catalyst performance and facilitating the catalyst-product separation [24–30]. It has been well known that ILs can be functionalized flexibly by varying the nature of cations and/or anions with specific functionalities. Thus, it is possible to develop abundant functionalized ILs (FILs) dually possessing the characters of the incorporated functionalities as well as the ILs self [31–36]. The phosphine-FILs have long been investigated for the design of the ionic organometallates and the application to homogeneous catalysis which have been found to be the efficient alternatives to prevent significant leaching of the Rh-catalyst out of the IL phase [37–59]. Compared with Rh(I) analogs, such as RhICl(PPh3)3 [60,61], RhI(acac)(CO)PPh3 [62], and RhI(acac)(CO)2 (acac=acetoacetonato) which are typical catalysts for hydroformylation, there exist relatively few reported examples of the Rh(III) complexes containing tertiary phosphines like RhIIIH2Cl(PPh3)3 [63]. For the first time, the ionic phosphine-ligated Rh(III)-complex (bis-[1-butyl-2-diphenylphosphanyl-3-methylimidazolium]tetrachloridorhodium(III) hexafluorophosphate, 1A) was synthesized, which was inspired by the successful preparation of the phosphine-FIL of 1 by Brauer et al. [44]. Different from Brauer's work by using Rh(CO)2(acac) as a catalyst in combination of the as-synthesized phosphine-FILs for biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene [44], the developed 1A was investigated as the catalyst herein in considerations of its potential catalytic behavior and the ionic character (Scheme 1 ). In order to further tailor the activity and selectivity of 1A, a series of ligand-FILs were developed. Reasonably, the use of the RTIL as the solvent could guarantee the tight capture of the ionic Rh-catalyst 1A and the ionic ligand in the IL phase, and then facilitated the strict IL-organic biphasic hydroformylation and the separation/recycling workup. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and analysis The chemical reagents were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and Alfa Aesar China, and used as received. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS 670 spectrometer. The 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer. The 31P NMR spectra were referenced to 85% H3PO4 sealed in a capillary tube as an internal standard.

In N2 atmosphere, the solution of [Bmim]PF6 (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 911mg, 3.2mmol) in 15mL dry CH2Cl2 (refluxed in CaH2 and distilled freshly before use) was cooled down to −78°C, in which 1.5mL n-BuLi (2.4M, in petroleum ether, 3.5mmol) was added dropwise during 5min. After stirring the mixed solution for 1h, chlorodi(furan-2-yl)phosphine (770mg, 3.5mmol) was added dropwise. The resultant mixture was stirred at −78°C, and then the reaction temperature was warmed up simultaneously from −78°C to ambient. After quenching excess n-BuLi with deionized water, the obtained organic phase was removed of solvent in vacuo after drying with anhydrous MgSO4. The left residue was recrystallized with CH2Cl2/EtOH to yield the white acicular microcrystallines as the product of 2 (yield, 20wt%). 1H NMR (500MHz, CDCl3): δ H =7.8 (s, 2H, CH3NC(H)C(H)N), 7.5 (s, 2H, furan-2-yl, 2[C-CHCHCH-O]), 7.1 (s, 2H, furan-2-yl, 2[C-CHCHCH-O]), 6.6 (s, 2H, furan-2-yl, 2[C-CHCHCH-O]),4.3 (t, 2H, J =7.5Hz, NCH 2), 3.8 (s, 3H, NCH 3 ), 1.7 (m, 2H, J =7.5Hz, NCH2CH 2 CH2CH3), 1.3 (m, 2H, NCH2CH2CH 2 CH3), 0.9 (t, 3H, J =7.5Hz, NCH2CH2CH2CH 3 )ppm. 31P NMR (500MHz, CDCl3, 85% H3PO4 sealed in a capillary glass tube as external standard): δ P =−79.3 (s, NC(P)N), −144.1 (quintet, PF6 −)ppm. Elemental analysis found (calcd.) for C20H24N2P2F6: C 51.26 (51.28), H 5.09 (5.13), N 6.02 (5.98). 2.2.3 1-(2′-Piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-2-diphenylphosphino-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (3) 1-(2′-Piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-2-diphenylphosphino-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (3) was prepared according to our previously published method [64]. 2.2.4 1-(2′-Piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (4) 1-(2′-Piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate was prepared according to our previously published method [65]. 2.2.5 1-(2′-Piperid–1′-yl-ethyl)-2-methyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (5) The preparation procedures of 1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate was similar to those of 4, while the starting material of 1,2-dimethylimidazole was used in place of N-methylimidazole. 2.2.6 1-(2′-Piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([PEmim]BF4) 1-(2′-Piperid-1-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was prepared according to our previously published method [65], with some modifications. In this experiment, the obtained 1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride was ion-exchanged with NaBF4. After extraction by CH2Cl2 from the aqueous solution and the solvent removal under vacuum, the product of [PEmim]BF4 was obtained as the sticky colorless liquid. 2.2.7 Bis-[1-butyl-2-diphenylphosphanyl-3-methylimidazolium]tetrachloridorhodium(III) hexafluorophosphate ([RhCl4(L)2]PF6, 1A) Under N2 atmosphere, to the solution of 1 (330mg, 0.7mmol) in 30mL methanol was added RhCl3·3H2O (80mg, 0.3mmol). The obtained mixtures were refluxed under vigorous stirring for 12h. The precipitated solids were collected and washed with methanol and diethyl ether respectively to give the orange-red powders as 1A with yield of 45mol%. The single crystals that were suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were grown in acetone/hexane. TG/DTA (in air flow): thermal decomposition temperature of 1A is 180°C. FT-IR (KBr pellet): 3435 (w), 3100 (w), 2961 (m), 2930 (w), 2873 (w), 1622 (w), 1570 (w), 1483 (m), 1461 (w), 1435 (s), 1382 (w), 1086 (m), 833 (P-F, s), 750 (s), 698 (s), 558 (s). 1H NMR (δ, ppm, acetone-d 6): 8.70 (m, ortho-4H, PPh 2), 8.05 (s, 1H, NC(H)C(H)N+), 7.96 (s, 1H, NC(H)C(H)N+), 7.52 (m, para-2H, PPh 2), 7.46 (m, meta-4H, PPh 2), 3.98 (m, br, 2H, CH 2 CH2CH2CH3), 3.78 (s, 3H), 1.90 (s, br, CH2CH 2 CH2CH3), 1.05 (s, br, CH2CH2CH 2 CH3), 0.71 (t, 3H, J =7.0Hz, CH2CH 2CH2CH 3 ). 31P NMR (δ, ppm, acetone-d 6): 13.6 (s, br, PPh2), −142.6 (sept., PF6 −). CHN-elemental analysis (%) (found): C 46.28, H 4.52, N 5.91 (calcd., C 46.35, H 4.67, H 5.41). 2.3 General procedures for the biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene Hydroformylation experiments were carried out in a sealed Teflon-lined stainless autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. In a typical experiment, the isolated crystalline catalyst of 1A (0.01mmol) was mixed with 3mL of the RTIL, 0.06mmol of the ligand, and 20mmol of 1-octene sequentially. The obtained mixture sealed in the autoclave was purged with nitrogen (0.1MPa) three times and then pressurized with syngas (CO/H2 =1:1) to 4.0MPa. The autoclave was fixed in an oil bath (120°C) for 2h under vigorous stirring (ca. 1000rpm). Upon completion, the autoclave was cooled down and degassed. The upper organic phase was decanted from the obtained biphasic reaction mixture, and the left IL phase was extracted with diethyl ether (3mL×3). The combined organic phase was analyzed by GC to determine the conversion of 1-octene (n-dodecane as internal standard) and the selectivity to nonanals (normalization method). The left IL phase was directly used without further treatment for next run if required. 3 Results and discussion The tedious synthesis of phosphine-ligated Rh(III) complexes such as RhIIIH2Cl(PPh3)3 [63] makes these analogs rarely used in catalysis. Herein, through complexation of RhCl3·3H2O with the phosphine-FIL of 1 following the similar procedures for the preparation of Wilkinson catalyst of RhICl(PPh3)3 [60,61], the novel ionic complex of 1A, in which Rh ion was in +3 valence state, was obtained as an orange-red solid with the yield of 45mol%. When one equivalent of n-Bu4NCl was added additionally, the yield of 1A was increased up to 85mol% (see the Supporting information for the structural details of 1A analyzed by the single crystal X-ray diffraction). The facile availability of 1A in hand invoked us to investigate its catalytic performance for the first time, in terms of activity, selectivity, stability, and recyclability for hydroformylation of 1-octene. Since 1A was well soluble in the RTILs due to the ionic compatibility, the RTILs were selected as the solvents to fulfill the biphasic hydroformylation. On the other hand, a series of P-, N-, and N,P-hybrid-ligands with different electronic and steric effects were synthesized and applied to tune the catalytic behavior of 1A. In order to match the ionic compatibility with 1A and the IL solvent, the P-containing, N-containing, and hybrid P,N-containing ligands were carefully grafted into the imidazolium-based IL skeleton to develop a series of ligand-FILs. The influence of these ligand-FILs on the catalytic behavior of 1A was summarized in Table 1 . Without the presence of any ligand, only 35% of 1-octene was converted with 82% selectivity to nonanals in [Bmim]BF4 (Entry 1). Comparatively, the P,N-hybrid ligand of 3 was found to be the best candidate to improve the activity of 1A, leading to the excellent conversion of 1-octene along with 90% selectivity to nonanals (Entry 4). However, the monodentate P-containing ligands (1, 2, PPh3, and OPPh3), no matter as the ionic donors or the neutral ones, depressed the activity of 1A badly (Entries 2, 3, 7, and 8), probably due to the in situ formed over-stable Rh-complexes against the formation of the active RhI-H species responsible for the activation of 1-octene. When the N-containing ligands of 4 and 5 were applied, the improved effect on the performance of 1A was observed but less effectively than that over 3, leading to the moderate conversions of 1-octene (Entries 5 and 6). Anyway, it was found that the presence of the ligands universally gave rise to the L/B ratio. The results in Table 1 showed that the bidentate hybrid N,P-ligand of 3 was the best candidate to spur the activity and selectivity of 1A. It has been reported that many multidentate ligands that contain significantly different types of hard (N-, O-, NHC-) and soft (P-) donors, which were called hemilabile ligands, have been studied because of their potential application in homogeneous catalysis [66–72]. These ligands possess one weakly N- (or O-, NHC-) coordinating site that can reversibly release during the catalytic cycle and provide unsaturation site at the metal center. Thus, the less strongly bound moiety of this type of ligand is capable of temporarily holding a coordination site on the metal and then being released for the substrate insertion timely [73]. 3 as a hybrid P,N-ligand with the hemilabile ligation to 1A could offer a necessary unsaturation site for 1-octene insertion at N-coordinating site and hold the Rh ion tightly by the P-ligand arm. The comparison data of 1A to the other Rh-complexes as the catalyst precursors for the biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene were summarized in Table 2 . Without the presence of any ligand, 1A in [Bmim]BF4 exhibited the lowest activity and selectivity in comparison with Rh(CO)2(acac) and RhCl(PPh3)3 (Entries 1 vs 2 and 3). However, when the hybrid P,N-ligand of 3 was added additionally at the optimized P/Rh molar ratio of 6, the catalytic performance of 1A in terms of activity and selectivity was boosted dramatically up to the competitive level of Rh(CO)2(acac), and RhCl(PPh3)3, along with the highest L/B ratio (Entries 4 vs 5 and 6). When [PEmim]BF4 possessing a piperidyl tail at imidazolium side-chain was used as the solvent instead, the conversion of 98% was obtained with 94% selectivity to nonanals while the reaction time was prolonged to 3h (Entry 7). However, if the RTIL of [Bpy]BF4 was used as the solvent under the same conditions, only 33% of conversion was obtained with 88% selectivity to nonanals (Entry 8). Specifically in this case, the branched-nonanals were absolutely the main-products (L/B=0.05). These results suggested that the uses of the imidazolium-based ILs such as [Bmim]BF4 and [PEmim]BF4 as the solvents not only ensure a complete dissolution of both the ionic catalyst of 1A and the ionic ligand of 3 to fulfill the biphasic reaction, but also synergetically benefit the activity of 1A as the co-ligands. As a nucleophilic NHC-ligand (NHC, N-heterocyclic carbene), the imidazolium-based IL has been proved to offer the ligation to the Rh-complex, which could spur of the catalytic behavior of the Rh-complex [74]. Hence, the use of [Bpy]BF4 without any coordination ability led to the poor activity of 1A. It was also found that the reaction efficiency in the biphasic hydroformylation over 1A in [Bmim]BF4 and [PEmim]BF4 was as high as that in the homogeneous one with the comparative TONs (Entries 4 and 7 vs 9). The insensitivity to moisture and air of 1A and 3 facilitated their manipulation in open air for the recycling uses. Table 3 summarized the recycling uses of 1A and 3 in the RTIL for biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene. 1A and 3 were miscible in [Bmim]BF4 or [PEmim]BF4 due to the same ionophilicity and the structural similarity; whereas the non-polar 1-octene was immiscible. As a result, the hydroformylation of 1-octene catalyzed by 1A–3 in the IL solvent was a typical biphasic reaction, the work-up for separation and recycling was simplified greatly. Upon completion in each run, the upper organic phase was separated by decantation for GC analyses. Then the lower IL phase containing 1A and 3 was used for next run after the extraction by diethyl ether. It was found that, when [Bmim]BF4 was used as the solvent, the conversion of 1-octene decreased rapidly during recycling even under the prolonged reaction time (Column I). The ICP analysis proved that the leaching of Rh and P into the upper organic phase was serious. After 4 runs, 16% of Rh (coming from 1A) and 67% of P (coming from 3) were lost into the organic phase. It was also noticed that the upper organic phase got tainted to orange-yellow color after each cycle, apparently indicating the loss of the Rh-catalyst out of the IL phase. Reasonably, the products of nonanals with relatively higher polarity could extract the Rh-catalyst and the ligand out of the IL phase. In comparison to the Rh-catalyst, the P-ligand was more prone to leach. The ineffective capture of the Rh–P system in [Bmim]BF4, and the consequent serious loss out of the IL phase urged us to explore other ILs. Fortunately, [PEmim]BF4 was found to be able to capture 1A and 3 tightly without sacrificing the activity of them. The IL phase was recovered and then recycled for 7 runs (Column II). The leaching of Rh in the combined organic phase after 7 runs was below the detection limit of ICP (<0.1μg/g), and the leaching of P was <10%, indicating the tight lock of the Rh–P system in [PEmim]BF4. These results suggested that [PEmim]BF4 as a hybrid NHC, N-bidentate ligand further consolidate the capture of the Rh–P catalytic system in the IL network through the reinforced coordination interaction and the electrostatic interaction. Although the tight lock of the Rh–P system into the IL phase was guaranteed, the declined TOF was still observed during recycling, indicating that the deactivation of the Rh–P system itself but not the leaching corresponded to such TOF decrease. Especially from the 1st run to 2nd, TOF dropped by a factor of four (Entries 1 vs 2, Column II). From the 3rd run afterwards, only the slight activity loss was observed (Entries 2–7). The formation of the relatively low active Rh-dimer [2] derived from the fresh 1A with the aid of the ligand and syngas in the 1st run might be responsible for the dramatic TOF drop in the 2nd run. Such Rh-dimer was thermodynamically more stable so that exhibited relatively low activity, leading to the sluggish but sustainable transformation of 1-octene to nonanals in the subsequent runs at the prolonged reaction time. The 31P NMR analysis of the remaining IL solution after 7 runs showed several phosphorous signals but not ascribed to 1A (δ =13.6ppm), indicating the derivation of 1A as a catalyst precursor to the other P-containing species, some of which might be responsible for the gradual deactivation of the Rh-catalyst. Anyway, at present stage, without more analytic evidences it was difficult to determine if these P-signals were ascribed to be the Rh-dimer/cluster or other species formed in situ. 4 Conclusions The ionic Rh(III)-complex of 1A ligated by the phosphine-FIL was synthesized for the first time, which was insensitivity to moisture and air. The molecular structure of 1A analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed a highly symmetrical RhIII-centered octahedron cation with PF6 − as the counter-anion. When 1A was used as the catalyst precursor for biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene in the IL phase, the hemilabile hybrid P,N-ligand-FIL of 3 was found to be the best candidate to spur the activity of 1A with the TON of 1730. In comparison to [Bmim]BF4, [PEmim]BF4 was proved to be the more effective IL solvent to capture the ionic 1A and 3 to guarantee an absolute biphasic reaction without Rh leaching. The catalytic system of 1A–3 in [PEmim]BF4 could be recycled for 7 runs along with the declined TOFs.

        "dc:description": "A novel ionic complex with insensitivity to moisture and air, bis-[1-butyl-2-diphenylphosphanyl-3-methylimidazolium]tetrachloridorhodium(III) hexafluorophosphate (1A), has been synthesized and fully characterized. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 1A is composed of the Rh(III)-complex cation and the counter-anion of PF6 −. The complex cation has highly symmetrical RhIII-centered octahedron geometry with four Cl atoms in the equatorial plane and two imidazolium-substituted phosphine ligands in the axial position. The catalytic performance of 1A, which could be tailored by the ligands and the solvents, was investigated toward the biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene. It was found that the presence of the hemilabile hybrid P,N-ligand of 3 (1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-2-diphenylphosphino-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate), as a kind of ligand-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs), could dramatically spur the catalytic activity of 1A. The use of the RTIL of [PEmim]BF4 (1-(2′-piperid-1′-yl-ethyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as the solvent not only fulfilled the efficient biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene, but also guaranteed the successful recovery and recycling of the ionic compositions of 1A and 3.",
