Methanol-deuterium exchange on samples containing 5% Nb205 T. Hoffer and L. Guczi Surface Science and Catalysis Laboratory, Institute of Isotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 77, H-1525 Budapest (Hungary) (Received February 27, 1991; accepted July 17, 1991) Abstract 5% Nb20b-modified Pt/A1203 with two metal loadings (0.55 and 10 wt.% Pt) have been investigated in the methane/D2, methanol/D2 reactions and in the formation of dimethyl ether as a function of various oxidation and hydrogenation heat treatments. As was established earlier [261, the Pt dispersion changes according to the heat treatment, being higher after high temperature oxidation and lower after high temperature reduction in hydrogen. The turnover frequency of methane exchange is not affected by the various treatments, whereas methanol exchange and dimethyl ether formation are influenced to a large extent. The data can be interpreted by the partial reduction of Nb205 during hydrogenation, followed by NbOx migration onto the platinum particles. Thus, the methyl groups in the methoxide species attached to the Lewis sites on the alumina can interact with the platinum surface for multiple exchange. The decrease in the activity after successive reactions may be attributed to the further spread of the NbOx species, thereby creating more acidic sites, which increases the rate of DME formation. Introduction Since the discovery of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) on supported noble metal catalysts, Nb20,, has been the subject of wide-scale research. The pure oxide alone is hard to reduce [ 11, but in the presence of noble transition metals a part of Nb205 forms niobium suboxide, which migrates to the metal surface providing typical SMSI phenomena. That is, after high temperature reduction, suppression of hydrogen chemisorption [2], drops in the rate of ethane hydrogenolysis [3-5] and in that of the CO hydrogenation [6, 7 ] have been observed. The partially reduced NbOx migrates to the metal during treatment at 773 K even in He [3, 41. When NbOx was deposited on Pt foil, evidence was found for the formation of niobia surface layer [8, 9]. Niobia is a frequently used promoter for supported noble metal catalysts [ 10-17 ]. As far as industrially important processes are concerned, niobia is a good promoter for the reaction of e.g. NO + NH3 (reaction rate increase) 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 86 [ 181 whereas the rate of NO + CO reaction is decreased by Nb205 addition [ 191. In the CO + HZ reaction over nickel catalysts the sequence of the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO conversion is Ni/Si02 < Ni/Nb205 < Ni/Si02/Nb2O5, although TOF is lower in the SMSI state [3, 121. Niobia-promoted Ru/A1203 catalyst shows a higher rate of CO + HZ reaction, and the yields of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons are also increased [ 16, 171. In the reaction of ethanol over Nb205/AI203 and Nb(V) monomers supported on A1203, preferential dehydrogenation is observed [ 14, 151. The promoting effect seems to originate from two characteristic features of niobia. First, its partial reducibility results in easy migration and decoration of the metal surface by the mobile niobium suboxide, which causes significant changes in chemisorption and reactivity of the metal. A second feature is the unique acidic character of niobia: Nb205 loses its Br6nsted acidity and most of its Lewis acidity when heated to 773 K [ 181. However, after similar treatment of the Nb205/A]203 system, the Lewis acid site concentration on the A1203 surface is enhanced, with a maximum at 5 wt.% Nb205 loading. Simultaneously, Bronsted acid sites are also generated with increasing niobia loading [201, proved by its enhanced efficiency in cracking reactions [211. Among rare earth metals, promoters such as La203 and Ce02 appeared to exert significant promoter effect in alcohol formation on the promoted Pd and Rh catalysts supported on various oxides and NaX/zeolite [22-251. Furthermore, recently we have also found evidence for the promoting effect of niobia on Pt/A1203 catalysts [261. Namely, the increased selectivity for oxygenate formation in the CO + HZ reaction, resulting mainly in dimethyl ether, can be attributed to the support acidity. Correlation was found between the temperature of the oxidation-reduction pretreatment of the sample and both the dispersion and catalytic activity. These investigations, however, did not clarify the correlation between the product composition (mainly the appearance of oxygenates) and the surface structure of the catalyst. We have not studied the nature of interaction observed in the methanol-catalyst system. In earlier work, the method of methanol-deuterium exchange was introduced to study the reactivity of the different bonds (O-H, C-H) in methanol in its interaction with the catalyst surface [271. In that work and in subsequent papers [28-301 the effect of Pt dispersion in Pt/A1203 catalysts was established, i.e. the higher the Pt dispersion, the higher the rate of both formation and exchange reaction of methanol. The OH group is much more reactive in the exchange reaction than the CH3 group, but the increasing dispersion is advantageous for multiple exchange, which points to the important role of the metal-support interface. Niobia is a good candidate to modify the metal-support interface due to the above-mentioned unique properties. In the present work we aim to elucidate the nature of interaction between methanol and niobia-promoted Pt/A1203 by means of isotope exchange between methanol and deuterium in order to obtain additional information about further reaction of methanol. 87 Experimental Catalysts were prepared by impregnation of y-alumina (Degussa C) with a 20 wt.% solution of niobium oxalate (Niobium Products, Nb205 content: 20.5 wt.% with excess oxalic acid to enhance solubility). After drying at 380 K for 48 h, the oxalate ligands were stripped off during treatment at 770 K for 16 h, to yield 5 wt.% Nb2O5/A]203. On this support and on y-alumina, Pt was deposited by impregnation (incipient wetness) with HZPtCIs solution and dried at 390 K for 24 h. The samples with 0.55 and 10 wt.% Pt were treated as follows: calcined in oxygen at 573 K or 773 K and after calcination reduced in hydrogen either at 573 K or at 773 K. Both calcination and reduction were conducted at atmospheric pressures for 1 h. The four samples investigated are denoted as follows: A: 10% Pt/A1203; B: 10% Pt/5%Nb20r,/ A1203; C: 0.55% Pt/A1203; D: 0.55% Pt/5ONb205/A1203. The various measurements are identified through this paper by the following notation: calcination temperature (K)-reduction temperature (K), e.g. 573-573 means calcination at 573 K followed by reduction in hydrogen at 573 K. The interaction between methanol and the samples was studied by the hydrogen-deuterium exchange method described previously [271. Deuterium was purified by passing through a heated silver-palladium thimble using analytical grade methanol and methane (puriss. from Fluka Ag). Methanol (or methane): deuterium ratio was 1:10 with a total pressure of about 1.3 x 104 Pa. Reaction was carried out in a glass circulating apparatus after in situ oxygen-hydrogen treatments. The rate of exchange was measured by mass spectrometry using a capillary leak to continuously introduce a fraction of the sample to the AEI MS 20 mass spectrometer. A computer program performed the necessary corrections for the naturally occurring '3C, D and for the fragmentation. Initial rates of the formation of the products containing different numbers of deuterium atoms (ki, where i = 1. . .4) as well as the rate of the disappearance of the `light' molecule (ko) were calculated and expressed in mol s-' g,at ' units. The ratio of the rates of stepwise to multiple exchange was evaluated by the equation of RI /RZ =kl /(k2 + k3 + k4) and proved to be of practical importance [30]. TOF were also calculated based on the platinum surface as determined by CO chemisorption. Dimethyl ether formation was characterized by KDME: the initial slope of the XDMEUs. time curves, where XDME is the amount of ether per initial amount of methanol (both as detected by mass peaks) per gram of catalyst. Dispersion of platinum, Dp,, was determined by CO chemisorption [261. After calcination (573 or 773 K) temperature-programmed reduction was carried out using 1% H2 in Ar (flow rate 40 cm3 min-') with 5 K min-' ramp rate in the temperature range between 298 and 573 or 773 K. At the final temperature, reduction was completed in a stream of HZ for 1 h, then 88 the sample was cooled to room temperature followed by purge in argon. Finally, the HZ TPD measurement was performed. After TPD the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in Ar then H2 was chemisorbed and titrated with 02. After a subsequent reduction procedure the catalyst was purged by argon and cooled to room temperature. Finally, CO chemisorption was measured in Ar. Results Table 1 contains the Dp,, data and the results of the hydrogen-oxygen titration denoted by OIH. As a result of the heat treatment for oxidation and reduction, it can be established that generallyD,, is increased by oxidation while the subsequent reduction decreases this value. The increasing value for the O/H ratio is a measure of the reduction of the niobia (see below). Of the two types of hydrogen atoms in methanol, we wanted to study first the hydrogen-deuterium exchange in the methyl group alone. For this purpose methane was used as a model for the CH3 group of methanol. Since the reactivity of the different catalyst samples in methane exchange varied to a large extent, the different catalysts were tested at different temperatures. The rates were determined by the consumption of methane-do or by the formation of methane-d1 to methane-d4, the former being listed in Table 1.

The TOF for the total exchange (TOF ko) is calculated from Table 1 and is plotted vs. treatment in Fig. 1. The dependence of these values on the treatment is almost negligible, except for sample A. Figure 2 shows the R1/RZ value, which is indicative of the product composition (a high value indicates the presence of mostly monodeuterated methane). Due to the different temperatures applied for the measurements, only the treatment dependence is worth studying here, but pronounced tendencies are absent. The rates of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in methanol are presented in Table 2. Here all measurements were carried out at 473 K.

The increasing amount of products with more than one deuterium atom is ascribed to the niobia addition. Figure 3 illustrates the TOF for the methanol-deuterium exchange reaction for the multiple exchange (calculated from the sum of the rates of formation of methanol-d2 to methanol-d4), while Fig. 4 represents the R, /R2 ratio. It is clear from these figures and from Table 2 that: - all exchange rates are enhanced by niobia addition, but multiple exchange rates are increased to a much larger extent, resulting in a lower Rl /R2 ratio; - for niobia-containing samples, reduction at high temperature greatly increases the rates of methanol-d2 to methanol-d4; - lower platinum loading (higher dispersion) increases all rates, but multiple exchange rates increase to a smaller extent, which results in a higher RI/RZ ratio. 31 100 h M 60 I W 20 a 573-573 573-773 773-573 773-773 ao ~ 40 Treatment Fig. 3.

The KDMS values representing dimethyl ether (DME) formation and associated with the exchange reaction are shown in the last column of Table 2. In order to determine the effect of the support on DME formation, typical data for the 5%Nbz05/A1203 and for the y-alumina used as a support are also shown at the end of Table 2. Exchange data for both supports are estimated values due to the high experimental error involved in determination of very low rates. Data for dimethyl ether formation during methanol-deuterium reaction are presented in Fig. 5. Sample C shows the highest activity in this reaction, depending on the treatment temperature. However, with regard to the oxidation-reduction temperatures in sample D (with niobia), the same effect was found for both DME formation and the exchange reaction. Increasing the metal loading (sample A) results in a diminished rate of ether formation, which generally is further decreased by niobia addition. 92 15 12 h W 9 oT 573-573 573-773 2.50 2.00 1.00 Y 0.50 ' 0,00 773-573 773-773 Treatment Fig. 5.

In order to study the reproducibility of the catalysts several subsequent measurements were carried out on the same catalyst (sample B), bracketed by in situ oxidation-reduction treatments. The results, summarized in Table 3, clearly indicate that the treatments applied cannot fully restore the catalyst surface after methanol-deuterium exchange reactions: the effect of treatment is diminished on the used samples, and the catalysts show higher rates for dimethyl ether formation and higher R1 /RZ values, indicating that reaction rate is lower for the formation of highly deuterated products in the exchange reaction. Briefly, the reactivity of the used sample is closer to that of the niobia-free catalyst. 93 Discussion Earlier work carried out on niobia-containing supported transition metal catalysts has led to a model for the influence of the oxidation and reduction temperatures on the surface structure. According to this model, after high temperature reduction (HTR), Nb205 is partly reduced and the mobile NbOx phase migrates to the metal surface. This decoration decreases the available metal surface and initiates a special interface between metal and oxide which may be responsible for the significant difference in reactivity of the catalyst. However, these studies are mostly concerned with metal/niobia or metal/ silica modified with niobia. Somewhat different phenomena can be expected over alumina support, which itself has much stronger interaction with precious metals and probably also with niobia. Our previous studies [ 26 j by XPS could not prove any reduction of Nb205 after 1 h reduction at 773 K for sample B. However, on increasing the reduction temperature from 573 K to 773 K, the relative Pt 4fa2 to Al 2p intensities decreased from 0.67 to 0.54, while the relative Nb 3d to Al 2p intensities remained the same. In contrast, oxygen titration of adsorbed hydrogen must be considered a more sensitive method to determine any changes in the valence state of niobium. It occurs according to the following equations: In the absence of niobia: Pt+ H -j PtH (hydrogen adsorption) (1) PtH + 2 O - Pt0 + I H20 (oxygen titration) (2) Assuming a H/Pt=1 ratio, the O/H ratio in titration becomes 1.5, while in the presence of hydrogen migration (spillover) to the support H /Pt > 1, and consequently O/H < 1.5. When partial reduction of the Nb205 can be assumed, the processes can be described as: Pt+Nb205-x+H- PtH+Nb205-x (hydrogen adsorption) (3) PtH + Nb205 _x + (2 + x)O ---3- Pt0 + Nb205 + -H20 (oxygen titration) (4) Here the O/H ratio=1.5 +x. Of course, if H /Pt < 1 this value is further increased. A marked difference can be observed between niobia-containing and niobia-free samples: for samples A and C the O/H ratio was always smaller than the stoichiometric 1.5, which can be attributed to the migration of hydrogen from the metal to the support, while for samples B and D after HTR the O/H ratio was higher than 2, which can be indicative of niobia reduction. A similar phenomenon was shown for Ir/Nbz05 catalyst [31 ]. (High O/H ratio can be interpreted in two equivalent ways: first, the amount of oxygen consumed for titration can be high because of OZ consumption by reduced niobia; second, chemisorbed H2 may be reduced, atypical phenomenon of SMSI, again due to reduced niobia.) It is therefore reasonable to assume that the marked decrease in dispersion after HTR is partly due to the migration 94 of NbOx to the metal surface. The decreased metal dispersion, Dp, is also a sign of this decoration. Platinum is a good catalyst for methane-deuterium exchange, which typically proceeds in stepwise manner. Methane is chemisorbed on the metal surface mostly by rupture of a single C-H bond, and therefore it can leave the surface as monodeuterated methane and combine with one of the deuterium atoms easily accessible on platinum. Further hydrogen atoms in the methane can be exchanged either by readsorption or by means of further C-H bond ruptures in the CH3 species formed during chemisorption. The latter case (multiple exchange) can be observed for the niobia-containing samples. The effect of the different treatments on methane exchange is the same as on dispersion, which is clearly illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 1. From the fact that TOF values are quite constant with respect to treatments, it can be concluded that methane exchange occurs over platinum surface without too much influence of the unreduced or partly reduced niobia phase. The same conclusion can be drawn from Fig. 2, which proves that the composition of the exchange products do not show a clear dependence on the oxygen-hydrogen treatment. Methanol exchange proceeds via a completely different mechanism. In methanol there are two types of hydrogen atoms, consequently the isotope exchange between methanol and deuterium may be indicative of either the interaction between the alcoholic hydrogen and the catalyst, which results in the formation of methanol-d,, or the exchange between the hydrogen in the methyl group and deuterium, leading to methanol-d2 - methanol-d4. It is known from previous studies [ 27 ] that the OH group in methanol is much more reactive in exchange reactions over Pt/A1203 than the-CH3 group, so the monodeuterated product is mostly CH30D. The explanation is the facile chemisorption of methanol on the Lewis acid sites of alumina through the alcoholic oxygen [32]. This surface species might be an intermediate for dimethyl ether as well as for monodeuterated methanol production. As the availability of atomic deuterium in the neighborhood of this surface methoxide group is an important criterion for exchange reaction, it is understandable why Pt/A1203 is much more active in the methanol exchange reaction than either the alumina support or platinum black catalysts [261. A different chemisorption mechanism is required for the exchange of hydrogens in the methyl group of methanol, where, similarly to methane exchange, C-H bonds are ruptured over the platinum surface. As a consequence, the alumina support itself does not show significant exchange in the methyl group. For interpretation of the marked increase in multiple exchange for the niobia-containing samples after HTR, two choices exist. We must assume either modification of the platinum surface itself, which favors multiple exchange by a chemisorption mechanism not typical for platinum, or an `anchoring' mechanism, which retains the methanol molecules in the vicinity of the platinum surface until exchange proceeds beyond formation of methanold, The former possibility would require a significant change in the electronic properties of platinum, a phenomenon which does not have enough exper- 95 imental support of theoretical probability and so will not be considered further. The `anchoring' mechanism can be formulated as follows: after HTR part of the niobia migrates onto the platinum surface (probably in a partly reduced form) and creates an extended metal-support interface by an increased perimeter along the niobia-platinum interface. This interface serves as a site for a bridge-type chemisorption of methanol, where methoxide species are held via AI-O-CH3 on the Lewis sites of the alumina support and the CH3 group can interact with the platinum surface. This OH end of the molecule is the `anchor' which ensures the methanol a prolonged time for the different C-H bonds to rupture one by one over the platinum surface, resulting in higher amounts of methanol-d2 - methanol-d4. The mechanism of methanol chemisorption over niobia requires further study, but considering the acidity of the catalyst the Lewis acid centers may take part in this process. Indeed, 5g'o Nb205 on A1203 has the highest Lewis acidity compared to other niobia concentrations {201. The turnover frequencies for the methanol exchange can be interpreted according to the above model. Comparison of samples A and C (niobia-free samples) indicates that an increase in dispersion enhances both single and multiple exchanges, but presumably by a different mechanism. The TOF value of the multiple exchange increases with higher dispersion because more platinum-support interface is generated which favors the above-mentioned `anchoring' reaction. The increase in TOF value for the formation of methanol-d1 is somewhat misleading here, because the exchange of -OH groups (which is responsible for the majority of methanol-d, formation) proceeds on alumina sites as well as on platinum. Therefore it is more realistic to consider the rate expressed for 1 g catalyst. These rates are about the same for samples A and C, indicating that a marked drop in platinum content provides more free alumina surface, which (along with the increased interface) compensates for the loss of platinum. It should be mentioned that the low reactivity of the alumina support (without Pt), even in single exchange (Table 2), is due to the lack of atomic surface deuterium. Chemisorption of methanol on Lewis acid centers is significant with or without platinum, as indicated by ether formation, so on Pt/A1203 catalyst alumina surface can play an important role in methanold1 formation with the help of deuterium provided by platinum. Addition of niobia to both 10% and 0.55% Pt/A1203 samples increases the multiple exchange (TOF in Fig. 3). On 109% samples it is accompanied by a loss in Pt dispersion after any treatment and a decrease in the rate of monodeuterated methanol formation (considering the rates in Table 2 as above). This decreasing amount of methanol-d, can be interpreted as the result of a smaller platinum surface, which provides less available atomic deuterium on the support surface thus hindering the formation of methanoldl; while the fraction of methanol-d1 formed on the platinum is also smaller on the lower platinum surface area. (Here again consideration of TOF values would not be appropriate.) 96 The majority of multiple exchanges seem to take place on the metal-support perimeter so that a decrease in dispersion is likely to suppress this reaction. However, the reverse is true for samples A and B. Dispersion is lower on niobia-containing samples, but the metal-support perimeter is different. The change of this interface from platinum-alumina to platinum-niobia counterbalances the effect of decreasing dispersion for the 10% Pt samples. The reason may be the somewhat higher Lewis acid center concentration over niobia/alumina [201 and/or the increased length of the metal-support perimeter, which is not directly connected with dispersion (especially after HTR, as a result of decoration of platinum by niobia). As a general rule (Table 1), dispersion is enhanced by increasing the oxidation temperature and is suppressed by increasing the reduction temperature. For 0.55% samples, niobia addition results in higher Pt dispersion after high temperature oxidation (HTO). Contrary to 10% samples, this small amount of Pt may, while in the mobile oxide form during HTO, find the most appropriate sites for spreading out. The most important effect of the different treatments is their influence on multiple exchange. The marked dependence of this reaction on reduction temperature over niobia-containing samples is strong evidence for the mechanism described above. The partially reduced, mobile niobia considerably increases the metal-support interface and the possibility of `anchored' methanol formation. (It must be mentioned that instead of `anchored' methanol, another adsorption mechanism is also conceivable, where the methanol is adsorbed alternately on the metal and support along their perimeter, thus hindering desorption). According to this scenario, in multiple exchange of methanol the best catalyst is sample D after HTR, because it contains platinum in a highly dispersed state, surrounded by niobia and forming additional metal-support interface with niobia having migrated onto the metal during reduction. 1iYom the dimethyl ether formation associated with the exchange reaction, the following conclusions can be drawn. On niobia-free samples, results show that the treatment temperature is more important than oxidative-reductive atmospheres (Fig. 5, sample C). The explanation can be found in the nature of alumina, i.e. in the formation of Lewis acid sites during heat treatments. These sites have a primary role in ether formation by means of the chemisorbed methoxide groups which also act in the exchange reaction. The presence of platinum strongly influences the ether formation [271. High platinum content is disadvantageous because Pt may occupy a considerable fraction of the sites responsible for the ether formation. Low platinum content has a smaller effect. The same is true for niobia-containing samples. Niobia has a small effect on the 10% sample, which has a few active sites left even without niobia. For the 0.55% sample, niobia has dramatic effect. Niobia/ alumina itself seem to be somewhat less active than alumina in ether formation, though this cannot explain the inactivity of sample D in ether formation. For this catalyst, treatment dependence may indicate the role of the metal-niobia perimeter in ether formation. 97 For used samples after both oxidation and reduction at 573 K or 773 K, there is a large decrease in platinum dispersion (Table 3). This decreased dispersion is likely due to the further decoration of the platinum particles, resulting in a diminished rate of methanol exchange. However, the enhanced DME formation might be the result of the increased acidity of the samples which underwent several heat treatments. In conclusion, it can be established that conversion of niobia into NbOx species result in a migration onto the metal surface. The extent of platinum promoter interface thus increases, causing an increased TOF for methanol exchange and an increased rate in multiple exchange. Consequently, both the decoration and metal-promoter interaction should be considered in the interpretation of the results. References 1 A. Sexton, A. E. Hughes and K. Foger, J.

Methanol—deuterium exchange on samples containing 5% Nb2O5 T. Hoffer L. Guczi Surface Science and Catalysis Laboratory, Institute of Isotopes of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 77, H-1525 Budapest Hungary 5% Nb2O5-modified Pt/Al2O3 with two metal loadings (0.55 and 10 wt.% Pt) have been investigated in the methane/D2, methanol/D2 reactions and in the formation of dimethyl ether as a function of various oxidation and hydrogenation heat treatments. As was established earlier [26], the Pt dispersion changes according to the heat treatment, being higher after high temperature oxidation and lower after high temperature reduction in hydrogen. The turnover frequency of methane exchange is not affected by the various treatments, whereas methanol exchange and dimethyl ether formation are influenced to a large extent. The data can be interpreted by the partial reduction of Nb2O5 during hydrogenation, followed by NbO x migration onto the platinum particles. Thus, the methyl groups in the methoxide species attached to the Lewis sites on the alumina can interact with the platinum surface for multiple exchange. The decrease in the activity after successive reactions may be attributed to the further spread of the NbOχ species, thereby creating more acidic sites, which increases the rate of DME formation.
