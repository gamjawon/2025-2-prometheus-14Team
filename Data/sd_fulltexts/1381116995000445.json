Introduction The characteristics of transition metal-graphite intercalation compounds (graphimets) have been thoroughly examined in the past decade [ 1-7 ] . Nevertheless, information on their structure is still rather limited. Graphite intercalation compounds are generally formed by the insertion of atomic layers of a guest species, called the intercalate, between layers of the graphite `host' [ 8 ] . For graphimets, inserted metal particles may be present either in the form * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00044-5 of an atomic dispersion [9,10], or as small clusters [ 9,11 ] . The fixed distance between the graphite layers prevents metal aggregation. On the other hand, graphimets may also contain a considerable amount of surface metal which is of crucial importance in catalytic transformations [ 3,9] . Thermal treatment of graphimets is likely to increase the surface metal content via the migration of interlayer particles [ 12 ] . We have studied the effect of medium-temperature reduction (MTR, 573 K) on the structure of a Pt-graphimet sample. The catalytic activities before and after such pretreatment were also investigated. 116 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Pt-graphimet (1% platinum in graphite) was a product of Alfa Chemical Company. Preparation of the sample included heating of a mixture of graphite powder and platinum(IV) chloride at 773 K in a chlorine stream for several days. Reduction was then carried out at 223 K with lithium biphenyl in a helium atmosphere. The product was washed in turn with tetrahydrofuran, acetone and water and then dried in vacuum at 413 K [13]. 2.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Measurements were carried out with a Zeiss 902 instrument. Prior to measurement, samples were ultrasonically dispersed in toluene [ 14] and then deposited on a plastic film supported by a Cu grid. Magnifications were in the range 5 X 1041.4 X 105 times. The smallest detectable particle size was 0.5 nm. 2.3. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) Experiments were performed with a PW 1830 Philips generator supplied with a Kratky compact camera. Measurements were evaluated in the Guinier range, spherical symmetry being assumed for the particles. The scattering intensity 1 is related to the radius of gyration R according to Eq. 1: lnl= lnlo - R2 h2 /3 where to is the scattering intensity at zero angle and the scattering vector h is a function of half of the scattering angle expressed in radians and the X-ray wavelength .1 (see Eq. 2) h = 41rsin d (2) R was determined from the slope of the Guinier plot [ 15 ] . The particle radius r was obtained from Eq. 3: R2=3/5r2 Mastalir et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 99 (1995)175-121 2.4. 02-H2 titration Measurements were performed by the conventional method [ 16] . Oz was preadsorbed on Ptgraphimet for different periods of time, and subsequent titration with HZ provided the number of active metal particles. The usual stoichiometry of Pt:H=1:3 was applied for calculations [ 17] . The values of dispersions are based on the total number of platinum atoms on the catalyst. 2.5. Sorption microcalorimetry The heat of adsorption of HZ was determined by coupling a volumetric apparatus to the batch unit of an LKB 2107 isothermal sorption microcalorimeter. Initially, 130 mg of sample was brought into contact with 40 kPa HZ at room temperature for 2 h. Afterwards, evacuation was performed and the sample was left at 403 K under vacuum overnight. Experiments were then carried out at 298 K. Adsorption of HZ was accomplished by admitting small doses of H2 gas into the calorimeter cell. Each dose produced a heat emission, which was recorded until the calorimetric baseline was attained. Desorption was effected by expansion of the gas phase in equilibrium with the adsorbate gas into a definite volume. Heat effects attributed to cell opening were corrected for by `blank runs', He being used instead of H2, under the same conditions. The integral molar enthalpy of chemisorption Q;nt was determined via Eq. 4: Qt=Qp-.olns=hs-h9 (4) where Qp - o is the heat of adsorption at zero pressure derived from extrapolation of the enthalpy isotherm, ns the amount of adsorbed H2 calculated from 02-HZ titration, and hs and hg are the molar enthalpies of the gas in the surface layer and the gas phase, respectively. 2.6. Catalytic test reaction (3) Catalytic activity was investigated via the reaction of cyclohexene hydrogenation, in a static recirculation reactor system. Details of the exper- A.

TEM image of 1 % Pt-graphimet after medium-temperature reduction (MTR sample). imental apparatus are described elsewhere [ 18 ] . The mass of catalyst used was 5 mg. Before measurements, the sample was pretreated at 298 K for 2 h under 13.3 kPa H2. MTR of the catalyst was 117 effected at 573 K, under otherwise the same conditions. The reactant gas introduced into the reactor contained 1.7 kl'a cyclohexene, 10.1 kl'a HZ and 89.5 kPa argon. The time dependence of the conversion was measured at different temperatures. Reaction rates were calculated from the slopes, the number of the reactant molecules present at t = 0 being taken as 7.34 X 10'9. The products were analyzed with a Carlo Erba gas chromatograph. 3. Results and discussion The average particle sizes for the original Ptgraphimet and that treated by MTR were determined from TEM and SAXS measurements. TEM experiments on the original sample suggested the presence of small, evenly distributed particles, ranging in size from 1.2 to 14 nm ( Fig. 1) . For the MTR sample, however, the formation of large aggregates was observed in addition to the original small particles (Fig. 2). After pretreatment at 573 K, the particle size range was found to be 2-270 nm. The number of aggregates was substantially lower than that of the small particles. Guinier plots obtained from SAXS experiments are displayed in Fig. 3. Table 1 shows the mean particle diameters from both SAXS and TEM measurements. The agreement appears to be completely satisfactory. to s 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.8 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 l nm z Fig. 3. Guinier plots of 1% Pt-graphimet. Circles: original sample; squares: MTR sample. 118 A.

Mass of sample: 0.1300 g. In both cases, only a slight increase in the average particle size can be detected following medium-temperature pretreatment, despite the formation of large aggregates observed by TEM. Previous experiments [ 19 ] prove that for Pt-graphimet, more than half of the total amount of metal is situated in the interlayer space. Similarly to the intraparticulate atomic model described earlier [ 20 ] , sintering may occur by the transport of inserted metal atoms to the surface. The additional metal atoms may gather together to form large surface aggregates. On the other hand, MTR caused no significant change in the size of the finely distributed surface metal atoms observed in the original sample. The occurrence of sintering at 573 K points to an important difference between the structure of Pt-graphimet and that of supported platinum catalysts. In fact, despite the original presence of surface metal, Pt-graphimet is much more `fragile' than a supported sample, for the layered structure of the graphite `host' undergoes deformation even under relatively mild conditions. For supported platinum catalysts, sintering is generally observed above 773 K [ 20] . In some cases a much higher temperature is required for an appreciable change in structure [21,22]. Therefore, the role of interlayer metal should be taken into account in investigations of Pt-graphimet as a catalyst. Fig. 4 depicts the change in platinum dispersion as a function of oxidation time. For the original sample, it took 2 weeks of oxidation for the highest dispersion possible to be reached. For the pretreated sample, however, the number of active particles no longer increased after merely 4 days of oxidation. Moreover, the maximum dispersion value found after MTR (D=0.90) was significantly higher than before (D = O. . This suggests easier access for 02 gas to the platinum atoms available for adsorption. The results of sorption microcalorimetry experiments are illustrated in Fig. 5. Apart from the first step (chemisorption), adsorption is found to be reversible (physisorption) for both the original and the MTR sample. The heat of chemisorption per unit mass of catalyst remarkably increased after MTR. The integral molar enthalpies of adsorption ( - 29.9 kJ mol- t and - 33.8 kJ mol-', before and after MTR, respectively) are in good agreement with data published on supported Pt catalysts, ranging from - 25 kJ mol-' to - 97 kJ rnol-' [ 23 ] . For such samples, the integral molar heats of adsorption 119 60 - 50 ao 20 to 'a to A.

Both sorption microcalorimetry and OZ-HZ titration clearly indicate an increased amount of platinum metal available for H2 and 02 adsorption. As has already been pointed out, both OZ and HZ Table 2 Reaction rates and turnover frequencies for Pt-graphimet before and after MTR are able to penetrate between the graphite layers to some extent [19J. The enhancement in the number of active sites for 02 and HZ chemisorption may be due to the migration of interlayer metal atoms that were previously completely inaccessible. That is, besides surface aggregates, migration might lead to the formation of further inserted platinum atoms between the graphite layers, these being available for OZ and HZ adsorption. The catalytic activity of Pt-graphimet was investigated in the reaction of cyclohexene hydrogenation. Under the present experimental conditions, cyclohexane formation took place with 100% selectivity. Figs. 6 and 7 display plots of conversion vs. reaction time at various temperatures. After reduction at 573 K, somewhat higher reaction temperatures were required to obtain fair conversions. Table 2 presents the reaction rates and turnover frequencies (TOF) for both samples. Dispersions obtained from the OZ-Hz titration mentioned above were used in the calculations. The TOF values indicate that MTR resulted in a considerable loss of activity, the TOF being about one order of magnitude smaller than before. The decrease in catalytic activity suggests the encapsulation of active platinum atoms inside the graphite `host'. After MTR, a considerable number of surface atoms may become covered with graphite. This makes no difference for either OZ or HZ adsorption, as such particles may also appear between the graphite layers, still accessible for simple gases like OZ and H2. As the size of the cyclohexene molecule practically rules out the possibility of its penetrating between the graphite Original sample D = 0.64, Ee = 32.11 kJ mol ' TIK rX 10-'6 [molecule/s] TOF MTR sample D=0.90, E26.52 kJ mol ' TIK rX 10-'S [molecule/s] TOF 273 1.148 0.116 298 3.093 0.022 288 2.929 0.297 323 8.972 0.065 298 4.243 0.431 348 14.590 0.105 120 Mastalir et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A; Chemical 99 (1995)115-121 layers [ 19 ] , Pt-graphimet may be regarded as a 2. supported metal catalyst for cyclohexene hydro genation. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene on supported platinum catalysts is well known to be a structure-insensitive reaction [ 25 ] . This confirms the decrease in the number of accessible surface atoms as a possible reason for the significantly lower TOF values after MTR. The Arrhenius activation energies were calculated to be 32.1 kJ mol' and 26.5 kJ mol' for the samples reduced at room temperature and at 573 K, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the activation energy of 33.5 kJ mol-t published for Pt1Si02 [26]. 4. Conclusions Unlike traditional supported catalysts, Pt-graphimet displayed a remarkable change of structure even upon MTR, i.e. under relatively mild conditions. The formation of large surface aggregates at 573 K, observed by TEM, is attributed to the migration of inserted platinum atoms to the surface of the catalyst. Nevertheless, aggregation did not influence the average particle size to an appreciable extent. Thus, no significant sintering effect on the fine platinum particles of the original sample can be established in response to MTR. However, the increased platinum dispersion observed after MTR, and also the integral enthalpy isotherms of adsorption, indicate an enhanced number of active sites available for both H2 and OZ adsorption. Such active sites may be formed through the further migration of inserted metal atoms between the layers of the graphite `host'. On the other hand, encapsulation of active surface atoms into graphite explains the loss in the number of adsorbed cyclohexene molecules after MTR. Briefly, the effects of MTR on the structure and activity of Pt-graphimet were as follows: 1. the migration of interlayer platinum atoms to the surface, leading to metal aggregation; 3. the migration of further metal atoms between other graphite layers situated next to the surface, providing increased OZ and H2 adsorption; the encapsulation of small surface particles, decreasing the amount of adsorbed cyclohexene molecules.

        "dc:description": "The effect of medium-temperature reduction (MTR, 573 K) on the structure and catalytic activity of Pt-graphimet was studied by transmission electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, O2H2 titration and sorption microcalorimetry. The test reaction was the hydrogenation of cyclohexene. MTR resulted in the migration of interlayer platinum atoms to the catalyst surface, leading to metal aggregation and the formation of additional inserted active sites responsible for increased O2 and H2 adsorption. The decrease in catalytic activity observed upon MTR is attributed to the encapsulation of small surface particles inside the graphite ‘host’.",
