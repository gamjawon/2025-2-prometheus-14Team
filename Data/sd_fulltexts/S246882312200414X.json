Faced with the increasing energy demand, the extraction of heavy oil is crucial. Efficient catalysts can reduce the viscosity and improve the quality of heavy oil. In this paper, the highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst was prepared by one-pot method and was utilized for the viscosity reduction and upgrading of heavy oil. The results of H2-TPD, SEM, TEM, and XPS demonstrate that the average size of Ni/NC-6.0 is about 200 nm, and the Ni atoms coordinated with N atoms are highly dispersed over the surface of carbon support. The experimental results of catalytic aquathermolysis reveal that highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst showed efficient catalytic performance in reducing the degree of asphaltenes branching and cracking the long chains of resin. It can reduce the viscosity by 82.21% and decrease the heavy components by 13.04% through the occurrence of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, debranching, dealkylation of long-chain, depolymerization, and cracking. This work makes contributions to viscosity reduction and upgrading of heavy oil.

In recent years, the energy demand has continued to grow, while the supply of light crude oil (API = 22∼45, viscosity < 100mPa·s) has continued to decline [2,3]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop other available petroleum resources. Heavy oil (API < 22, viscosity > 100mPa·s) accounts for about 70% of the world's petroleum resources [3,4]. However, it is extremely difficult to exploit heavy oil with high viscosity and low fluidity [5]. In this regard, various viscosity reduction techniques have been developed, mainly including cold recovery (emulsification, dilution) and thermal recovery (cyclic steam stimulation, steam-assisted gravity drainage) [6]. Cold recovery is a low-risk extraction technology, but it is limited by the reservoir depth and viscosity of heavy oil. Thermal recovery technology based on the inverse relationship between the viscosity of heavy oil and temperature is capable of reducing the viscosity of heavy oil by increasing the reservoir temperature. However, the conventional thermal recovery technology, which is considered as physical viscosity reduction, can only temporarily reduce the viscosity of heavy oil, which will rebound after a period of time [7]. In 1983, Clark [8] found that the injection of steam into the reservoir not only reduced the viscosity of heavy oil due to the increase in temperature, but also chemically reacted with some heavy oil components. Subsequently, Hyne [9] further found that this reaction was intensified in the presence of a catalyst, thus allowing irreversible viscosity reduction to be achieved. This process of catalysts and heavy oil reaction under high-temperature water vapor (200–300 °C) and high pressure (2–5 MPa) is known as catalytic aquathermolysis technology [10]. This technology has received a great deal of attention from researchers in recent decades [11]. In order to improve the recovery efficiency of heavy oil, understanding the viscous mechanism of heavy oil and developing new efficient catalysts have become the most important issues for researchers. A large amount of literature has demonstrated that the existence of C-X (X = S, N, O) bonds in heavy oil macromolecules (resins, asphaltenes) and the interaction forces between resins and asphaltenes (Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking) are the main reasons for the high viscosity of heavy oil [12–14]. Therefore, the design and selection of catalysts are mostly focused on decreasing the heteroatom content in heavy oil and weakening the interaction forces between resins and asphaltenes. Noble metals (Pt, Pd) are the most suitable catalysts for catalytic aquathermolysis processes in heavy oil, but their high price limits their use [15,16]. In contrast to noble metals, transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo) are promising alternatives due to their low prices. So far, a variety of transition metal catalysts have been developed, such as water-soluble inorganic transition metal salts (FeSO4, CuSO4, NiSO4 [17]), oil-soluble transition metal compounds (Co(II) carboxylate [18], Mo(VI) oleate [19], Ni(II) naphthenate [20], Fe(III) aromatic sulfonate [21]), and heterogeneous transition metal particles (Metallic nickel particles [22], α-Fe2O3 [23], NiFe2O4 [24], Fe3O4/zeolites [25], MoS2 [26]). Notably, Ni-based catalysts have superior catalytic hydrogenation activity and lower hydrogenation temperatures (< 300 °C) compared to other transition metals [27–29]. This advantage can promote the conversion of more resins and asphaltenes into saturates and aromatics during catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy oil. Therefore, the development and use of Ni-based catalysts are expected to significantly upgrade the quality of heavy oil while reducing viscosity. Currently, the Ni-based catalysts used for catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy oil can be divided into two types, which are oil-soluble Ni-based catalysts (nickel stearate [28], nickel tallate [30]) and loaded Ni-based catalysts (Ni0/graphene [31], Al2O3 NiO [32]). Oil-soluble Ni-based catalysts have better viscosity reduction and upgrading (VRU) effects for heavy oil than loaded Ni-based catalysts because of their lipophilicity and maximal active metal utilization. However, their poor thermal stability and difficulty in separation limit the application [33]. In contrast, loaded Ni-based catalysts have better stability and ease of separation, but are less effective for VRU of heavy oil than oil-soluble Ni-based catalysts due to the small number of active sites. Therefore, enhancing the dispersion of Ni in Ni-based loaded catalysts is a potential strategy to further improve VRU of heavy oil. It is well known that highly dispersed catalysts have higher catalytic activity and atomic utilization compared to conventional catalysts [34–36]. However, there are few studies on highly dispersed Ni-based catalysts for VRU of heavy oil in the process of catalytic aquathermolysis. In this paper, highly dispersed Ni-based catalysts were synthesized using a facile one-pot method [37] and their effects on each component of heavy oil during catalytic aquathermolysis were discussed. This study is beneficial to improving the performance of loaded Ni-based catalysts on VRU of heavy oil. 2 Experiment 2.1 Preparation of the catalyst The chemical reagents from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. for the preparation of catalysts, including carbon black, nickel acetate tetrahydrate, dehydrated alcohol, and 1,10-phenanthroline, were at the level of analytical purity. A series of highly dispersed nickel-loaded nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts with different nickel loadings (denoted as Ni/NC-x, where x is the mass percent of nickel in catalysts) were prepared by the one-pot method. In a typical preparation procedure, 1.91 mmol nickel acetate tetrahydrate and 5.73 mmol 1,10-phenanthroline were dissolved in 60 mL dehydrated alcohol. A green solution was obtained by continuous stirring at room temperature for 30 min and then 840 mg of carbon black was added to the solution, followed by reflux condensation with continuous stirring at 65 °C for 4 h. Finally, the precursor was obtained after vacuum drying at 50 °C for 24 h. It was placed in a mortar for complete grinding and then transferred to a tube furnace for calcination in nitrogen gas atmosphere. The calcination temperature, heating rate, and annealing time were set to 600 °C, 10 °C/min, and 2 h, respectively. The final product Ni/NC-6.0 was successfully obtained after the temperature naturally cooled down to room temperature. Besides, other catalysts with loading different nickel content, including Ni/NC-5.2, Ni/NC-5.6, and Ni/NC-6.4, were also prepared by a similar process, in which the amounts of nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate were changed to 1.42, 1.65, and 2.22 mmol and 1,10-phenanthroline were changed proportionally to 4.26, 4.95 and 6.66 mmol, respectively. 2.2 Catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy oil The experiments on catalytic aquathermolysis were executed by adding Ni/NC-x catalysts to heavy oil from Luntai oilfield of China. Detailed operation steps were described as follows: multiple additives, including 24 mL distilled water, 0.5% catalyst by mass of heavy oil, and 1% tetralin as hydrogen donor by mass of heavy oil, were added to 60 g heavy oil to form a mixture. The mixture was transferred to a 250 mL autoclave. It was heated with stirring at 240 °C for 24 h after replacing the air in the autoclave with nitrogen gas. After completion of the reaction, the water was removed from heavy oil by centrifugation, and then the viscosity was determined at 50 °C. Finally, the heavy oil was separated into four components that were considered as saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) by column chromatography based on the Chinese SY/T 5119 - 2016 operation standard. For comparison, a series of experiments were carried out under the same condition. The basic properties of the initial heavy oil were as follows in Table 1 . 2.3 Characterization of the catalyst and heavy oil The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Empyrean, Cu). The morphology of the catalyst and distribution of Ni element on the catalyst was determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, MIRA3) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, F30), respectively. Temperature-programmed desorption of H2 (H2-TPD, BELCAT II) was used for the catalysts analysis. Finally, the catalyst was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB Xi+, Al). The viscosity and element content of heavy oil before and after catalytic aquathermolysis were determined by a programmable viscometer (DV2TLV) and an elemental analyzer (Vario ELⅢ). Then the heavy oil before and after catalytic aquathermolysis was separated to get SARA. The saturates and aromatics were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS, 7890A / 5975C). The resins and asphaltenes were measured by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet6700), in which the resins and asphaltenes were used by reflection and KBr pelleting methods, respectively. Synchronous UV fluorescence (LS55, Δλ = 5 nm, Ex slit = 4.5 nm, Em slit = 2.5 nm, scan speed) measurement was performed on the resins and asphaltenes, where the scanning speeds of resins and asphaltenes were 360 and 340 nm/min, respectively. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Catalyst analysis The XRD curves of the catalysts loaded with different Ni contents are shown in Fig. 1 . Only two broad peaks are present in each curve, which are at 25° and 43° respectively, corresponding to the (002) and the (100) crystal plane of graphitic hexagonal structure [38]. There is no peak related to Ni metal on the XRD curve because calcination at 600 °C prevented the formation of crystalline nickel [39]. The H2-TPD profile of Ni/NC catalysts with different Ni contents is shown in Fig. 2 . Ni/NC-5.2, Ni/NC-5.6, Ni/NC-6.0, and Ni/NC-6.4 catalysts all form two apparent peaks of hydrogen desorption. The desorption peaks at low (about 100 °C) and high (about 430 °C) temperature correspond to physical and chemical desorption of H2, respectively. Chemical desorption of H2 is often used to estimate dispersion of metal species over support [40]. the dispersion of Ni in the Ni/NC-5.2, Ni/NC-5.6, Ni/NC-6.0 and Ni/NC-6.4 catalysts is 15.2%, 18.8%, 20.6% and 17.5%, respectively. Obviously, Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst has the highest dispersion. This indicated that Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst can expose to more active sites than the other catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3 a, a spherical-like shape of Ni/NC-6.0 nanoparticles with an average size of about 200 nm can be observed. In addition, some larger particles are also present in Fig. 3a due to the partial agglomeration of carbon support during the calcining process. As observed in TEM images (Fig. 3b, c), no nanoparticles of Ni are present on carbon support. From Fig. 3d, there are only two diffraction rings belonging to carbon black and no other diffraction rings related to nickel. However, EDX element mappings (Fig. 3e – i) of Ni/NC-6.0 show that Ni and N elements are highly uniformly dispersed over carbon support. The results combined with XRD, H2-TPD and TEM strongly suggest that the Ni species over carbon support are dispersed in atomic or clustered. The elemental states in the Ni/NC-6.0 were determined by XPS. As shown in Fig. 4 a, The Ni 2p3/2 peak at 855.5 eV is attributed to Ni-N bond according to the comparison of binding energy [41]. It is demonstrated that the Ni atoms are coordinated with N atoms in Ni/NC-6.0. The C 1 s spectrum can be separated into two peaks (Fig. 4b), corresponding to C = N and CC or C = C bonds, respectively [42]. Multiple peaks can be obtained by fitting the peaks of the N 1 s spectrum (Fig. 4c), which belong to pyridine nitrogen (∼398.2 eV), NNi (∼399.5 eV), pyrrole nitrogen (∼400.5 eV), quaternary nitrogen (∼401.5 eV) and oxidized nitrogen (∼403 eV), respectively [38,43]. The N species are derived from 1,10-phenanthroline ligand, to stabilize the Ni species on carbon surfaces. 3.2 Analysis of catalytic performance on heavy oil In the catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy oil, not only catalyst is added but also tetralin is usually added. Tetralin can produce a large number of hydrogen radicals by cracking reaction to prevent the copolymerization reaction of macromolecular radicals and avoid viscosity rebound [7]. From Fig. 5 a, when Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst and tetralin are involved in the reaction alone, the viscosity reduction rate is not as high as when both are involved together. This indicates that there is a synergistic effect between the catalyst and tetralin on viscosity reduction. In addition, the performance of the catalysts with different Ni contents for viscosity reduction of heavy oil is compared. The results suggest that the viscosity reduction rate increases from 69.34% to 82.21% when the Ni content in the catalyst is increased from 5.2% to 6.0%. However, the viscosity reduction rate decreases instead when the Ni content in the catalyst continued to increase to 6.4%. The content of heavy components, which is resins and asphaltenes, also shows the same trend. As shown in Fig. 5b, the content of heavy components decreases from 30.56% to 19.28% when the Ni content in the catalyst increases from 5.2% to 6.0%. However, the content of heavy components increases instead when the Ni content in the catalyst continued to increase to 6.4%. This trend is attributed to the decrease in catalytic activity caused by the decrease in the dispersion of Ni over the catalyst. Undoubtedly, highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst have the best catalytic activity on VRU of heavy oil in catalytic aquathermolysis. The influence of catalysts on heavy oil was further investigated, and elemental contents of different samples after catalytic aquathermolysis were shown in Table 2 . Compared with the initial oil, the content of heteroatoms (S, N) is reduced slightly and the H/C atomic ratio is increased significantly after the catalytic aquathermolysis reaction. This indicates that Ni/NC-5.2, Ni/NC-5.6, Ni/NC-6.0, and Ni/NC-6.4 catalysts can promote the quality of heavy oil through occurrences of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrogenation reactions. In addition, with the increase of Ni dispersion over the catalyst, the ability of removing heteroatoms and hydrogenation of the catalyst gradually increases. In particular, Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst shows higher catalytic activity than other catalysts because of its high dispersion. The GC–MS of saturates and aromatics fractions of different samples after the reaction is shown in Fig. 6 . By comparing Fig. 6a - f, it can be easily found that only one new n-alkane (C14) is formed after the reaction in the presence of Ni/NC-5.2 or Ni/NC-6.4 catalyst. However, two new n-alkanes (C13, C14) can be formed after the reaction in the presence of Ni/NC-5.6 or Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst. This difference is due to the different dispersion of Ni over the catalyst, indicating that the highly dispersed Ni/CN-6.0 catalyst can promote the conversion of more heavy components to saturates by pyrolysis and dealkylated side-chain. Moreover, compared with the initial oil,the content of the original n-alkanes (C15 - C19) is relatively increased in presence of the catalysts. Compared with Fig. 6g - l, new peaks of aromatic compounds appeared after the reaction of heavy oil with the catalysts. This suggests that Ni/NC-5.2, Ni/NC-5.6 Ni/NC-6.0, and Ni/NC-6.4 catalysts, especially Ni/NC-6.4, can catalyze the heavy components to change into aromatics by depolymerization and ring-opening. Unexpectedly, few peaks of aromatic compounds disappeared after the reaction, which may be due to the conversion of some of the aromatic compounds with higher molecular weight or polarity into resins or asphaltenes by polymerization reaction. The structural information of the heavy components before and after the reaction was measured by FTIR spectroscopy. Spectrometric indices (*C1–4) is defined according to the following methods: *C1 = (D1736+D1672)/D1460 (oxidation index); *C2 = D1030/D1460 (sulfurization index); *C3 = D1377/(D1377 + D1460) (branching index); *C4 = D725/(D1377 + D1460) (long-chain index) [28,44]. The indexes are listed in Table 3 . Due to the oxidation effect of high-temperature water in the catalytic aquathermolysis, the oxidation index of resins increases compared with the initial oil. Conversely, the sulfurization index of both resins and asphaltenes is reduced compared with the initial oil. This indicates some of the sulfur-containing functional groups are removed in the presence of the catalysts. Furthermore, both the branching index and the long-chain index of resins and asphaltenes decrease compared with the initial oil, and the indices decrease further with increasing dispersion of Ni over the catalysts. This suggests that Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst with higher dispersion can promote more long-chain breakage of resins and deeper reduction of branching degree of asphaltenes. From Fig. 7 a, b, the peaks at 1600 cm−1, 867 cm−1, and 811 cm−1 weakened compared with the initial oil. This indicates that both aromatic and heterocyclic rings of resins and asphaltenes are reduced after the reaction [45]. As shown in Fig. 7c, d, this result can be further demonstrated by synchronous UV fluorescence. Based on the classification by Michels [46], the peaks in the ranges of 250–300 nm, 300–400 nm, and > 425 nm correspond to aromatic groups bearing 1 aromatic ring, 2 - 3 aromatic rings, and > 5 aromatic rings, respectively. The ratio of the relative intensities of the two peaks (I334/260, I476/342) represents the proportion of aromatic groups with different ring numbers in the resin and asphaltene molecules. Apparently, the share of aromatic groups with multiple aromatic rings is reduced in the resin and asphaltene molecules. This indicates that the resin and asphaltene molecules take place hydrogenation or ring-opening reactions in the presence of the catalysts. In particular, Ni/NC-6.0 catalysts with the highest dispersion can promote more resin and asphaltene molecules for hydrogenation or ring-opening reactions. 4 Conclusions In this paper, the highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 with a size of approximately 200 nm was successfully synthesized by one-pot method. The results of H2-TPD, TEM, and XPS indicated that the Ni atoms formed chemical bonds with N atoms on carbon support and were in a highly dispersed state. Furthermore, Ni/NC with different Ni content was used as the catalyst for VRU of heavy oil. The results showed that highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst had a better VRU performance. It was attributed to the Ni atoms in highly dispersed state, which possessed high catalytic activity and high atomic utilization. Combined with the results of elemental analysis, GCMS, FTIR, and synchronous UV fluorescence, the highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 not only had good hydrogenation ability but also effectively decreased the content of sulfur, and nitrogen in heavy oil. Moreover, it could significantly reduce the degree of asphaltenes branching, and crack the long-chain of resins. Meanwhile, new saturated hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons were produced, and the viscosity of heavy oil was reduced from 97,280 mPa·s to 17,310 mPa·s (50 °C). This study is helpful to understand the influence of highly dispersed Ni-based catalysts on VRU of heavy oil and facilitate heavy oil exploitation.

        "dc:description": "Faced with the increasing energy demand, the extraction of heavy oil is crucial. Efficient catalysts can reduce the viscosity and improve the quality of heavy oil. In this paper, the highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst was prepared by one-pot method and was utilized for the viscosity reduction and upgrading of heavy oil. The results of H2-TPD, SEM, TEM, and XPS demonstrate that the average size of Ni/NC-6.0 is about 200 nm, and the Ni atoms coordinated with N atoms are highly dispersed over the surface of carbon support. The experimental results of catalytic aquathermolysis reveal that highly dispersed Ni/NC-6.0 catalyst showed efficient catalytic performance in reducing the degree of asphaltenes branching and cracking the long chains of resin. It can reduce the viscosity by 82.21% and decrease the heavy components by 13.04% through the occurrence of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, debranching, dealkylation of long-chain, depolymerization, and cracking. This work makes contributions to viscosity reduction and upgrading of heavy oil.",
