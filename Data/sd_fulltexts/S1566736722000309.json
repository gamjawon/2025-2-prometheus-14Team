Controllable preparation of NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) on suitable conductive substrate is always a key precondition for their wide applications. Standing NiFe LDH nanosheets were successfully grown on stainless steel fibers felt (SSFF) at room temperature. The prepared SSFF@ NiFe LDH electrocatalyst displayed a high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte as well as alkaline seawater. The effects of mass loading and molar ratio of Ni/Fe on the electrocatalytic activity were also evaluated. With the optimized electrode, the overpotential for the anodic OER process only needs 198 and 260 mV at a current density of 10 and 300 mA cm−2, respectively. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Stainless steel NiFe LDH OER Water splitting Alkaline seawater 1 Introduction Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a highly promising strategy for zero–carbon emission energy resources. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in many energy conversion systems such as electrolysis of water and metal–air batteries [1–3]. Compared to the noble metal catalysts, the NiFe LDH received great attention in catalyzing the OER owing to their abundant active sites and low cost [4–7]. In recent years, the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of NiFe LDH has led to the design of high–performance NiFe LDH catalysts [8,9]. Besides, tuning the surface electronic properties of NiFe LDH by introducing transition metal ions [10,11], rare metal ions [12], noble metal ions [13], or the redox–active interlayer anions [14], significantly enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity of NiFe LDH. Constructing integrated electrodes with three–dimensional conductive substrates also effectively lower the overpotential for water splitting at a high current density [15–22]. Among various substrates, stainless steel with numerous porous structures has been proved to be ideal candidate as a low cost and effective substrate for OER [23–29]. Numerous OER catalysts such as Co3O4 microrods [24], Ni(Fe)OxHy nanosheets [25], and ZnO nanorods [26] grown on stainless steels performed excellent OER catalytic activity. Remarkably, some recent studies have demonstrated that stainless–steels can be activated to be efficient OER electrodes after etching, oxidation, and high temperature heating [27–29]. Nevertheless, the strong acid or high temperature environment during the preparation process is unfavorable for large–scale applications in the electrolysis of water. For the catalytic electrode, the facile preparation is equally important to the excellent catalytic activity. Herein, we report a simple solid alkali conversion approach promoting NiFe LDH nanosheets grown on the SSFF as an active OER electrode. With the optimized conditions, the as–prepared SSFF@ NiFe LDH electrocatalyst displays a high electrocatalytic performance for OER in alkaline electrolyte as well as alkaline seawater. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O, 99.9%), iron (II) nitrate nonahydrate (FeSO4∙7H2O, 99.9%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99%), absolute alcohol (99.9%) and acetone (99.9%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. MgO nanoparticles were purchased from Xianfeng NANO Technology Co., Ltd. and SSFFs with thickness of 0.5 mm were purchased from Xinxiang Zhengyuan Purification Technology Co., Ltd. Except where otherwise stated, all chemicals were used as received and all solutions were prepared using deionized water (18.6 MΩ cm−1 at 25 °C). 2.2 Materials synthesis Firstly, purchased MgO nanoparticles were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to remove adsorbed H2O and CO2. Then, fresh MgO nanoparticles were dispersed in absolute ethanol by sonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous dispersion of 10 mg mL−1. Commercial SSFFs (316 L) were used as substrates after being cleaned with acetone. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μL of MgO dispersion were coated on the SSFFs (1 × 1 cm2), respectively. After dried at 60° for 1 h, the as–prepared electrodes were immersed into the mixed solution of Ni(NO3)2∙6H2O and FeSO4∙7H2O. The molar ratio of Ni/Fe was controlled to 7:3, 8:2 or 9:1. After 1 h, the composite electrodes were washed with water and ethanol to remove free ions. The SSFF@NiFe LDH electrodes were successfully obtained after had been dried at 60° for 2 h. As received electrodes with different mass loadings (mg cm−2) were named as SSFF@NiFe LDH–1, SSFF@NiFe LDH–2, SSFF@NiFe LDH–3, SSFF@NiFe LDH–4 and SSFF@NiFe LDH–5, respectively. 2.3 Structural and morphological characterizations The phase and surface electronic structure of the as–synthesized electrodes were characterized by powder X–ray diffraction (XRD, Cu Kα radiation, Rigaku Ultima IV), X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5000 Versaprobe III with a monochromatic aluminum anode X–ray source) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope). The surface morphology and elements distributions of the electrodes were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, CASSI sigma) with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements were performed in a standard three–electrode system by using a CHI 660E electrochemistry workstation. All potentials were calibrated and converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The obtained NiFe LDH@SSFF electrodes were directly used as working electrodes, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (1.031 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + E0(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH (pH = 14). Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests of OER and HER were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with 90% iR compensation. Tafel plots were recorded with the linear regions, and subsequently fitted via the Tafel equation: η = b × log|j| + a, where η is the overpotential (V), |j| is the absolute value of the current density (mA cm−2), and b is the Tafel slope (mV dec−1). To prepare the control electrodes, the commercial RuO2 (99.9%) dispersion (5 mg of commercial powders and 4 μL of 5% nafion solution were dispersed in 1 mL water/isopropyl alcohol (4: 1 in volume) mixture) were coated onto the SSFFs (1 × 1 cm2) with a mass loading of 0.3 mg cm−2. The stability performance of OER was performed at an overpotential of 300 mV (without iR compensation) with Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) as the reference electrode. For the overall water splitting measurements, the couple SSFF@NiFe LDH|| SSFF@NiFe LDH electrodes were directly tested in 1 M KOH with and without 0.5 M NaCl. For the preparation of simulated alkaline seawater electrolyte, 2.9 g of NaCl and 5.6 g of KOH were dissolved in pure water and the resulting solution was transferred to a 100 mL–volumetric flask, diluted with pure water to volume, and mixed. The polarization curves were collected at 5 mV cm−2 with 90% iR compensation. All the electrochemical measurements were taken at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis scheme for SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode is presented in Fig. 1a. MgO nanoparticles were firstly dispersed on the surface of SSFF as the growing seeds. In the presence of transition metal ions, standing NiFe LDH nanosheets can easily grow on the surface of SSFF via the “MgO–mediated strategy [30]. Fig. 1b–g shows the surface topography of SSFF, SSFF@MgO and SSFF@NiFe LDH, respectively. In spite of the smooth surface of the fibers, NiFe LDH nanosheets can still grow firmly and uniformly on SSFF. From the high magnification SEM image embedded in Fig. 1g, it can be clearly observed that the vertically oriented NiFe LDH nanosheets were uniformly grown on the surface of SSFF. There is a large amount of void between the standing nanosheets, providing abundant active sites for the catalytic reaction. Element mapping in Fig. 1h confirms the well dispersed Fe, Ni and O elements on the surface of stainless–steel fiber. To rule out the effect of Fe and Ni elements in the stainless–steel substrate, element mappings in the dotted circle certificate the generated NiFe composite. To eliminate the influence of the substrate, NiFe composite was peeled off the substrate, and the TEM image in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information, SI) also proved the existence of Fe and Ni elements in the NiFe LDH nanosheets. As the mass loading increases, the NiFe LDH nanosheets were grown close together (Fig. S2, SI). The NiFe LDH nanosheets were grown along the surface of MgO nanoparticles based on a solid–solid conversion mechanism. Thus, the loading quantity of MgO can affect the density of as–grown NiFe LDH nanosheets. As a result of the strong diffraction peak intensity of the SSFF substrate, it is different to verify the phase of the composite electrode by XRD (Fig. S3, SI). In order to efficiently investigate the electronic structure and composition of electrode, XPS analysis was performed (Fig. 2 ). The main peaks in the full survey spectrum of SSFF@NiFe LDH (Fig. 2a) are indexed to C 1 s, O 1 s, Fe 2p and Ni 2p regions. The fitted peak at 706.5 eV in Fig. 2b is ascribed to metallic Fe0 phase in the stainless–steel. The other two characteristic peaks located at 710.4 and 713.1 eV correspond to Fe2+ and Fe3+ phase, respectively, which indicates iron doped in NiFe hydroxide composite. The fitted peaks at 854.5 and 856.0 eV in Fig. 2c are ascribed to metallic Ni0 phase in the stainless–steel and Ni2+ phase in NiFe hydroxide. The O 1 s XPS spectrum in Fig. 2d was deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.1, 531.4 and 532.7 eV, which can be assigned to oxygen in O2−, OH− and physically absorbed H2O, respectively [29]. The major percentage of OH− indicates that the NiFe composites on the surface mainly existed in the hydroxide state. The small percentage of O2− relates to the presence of an interlayer of NO3 − and SO4 2−. Meanwhile, the Raman spectrum of SSFF@NiFe LDH shown in Fig. 2e shows two representative bands at 454 and 540 cm−1 which are assigned to the eg bending mode and A1g stretching mode of NiO or FeO, respectively [31]. Two other minor bands at 299 and 705 cm−1 are associated with hydroxyl (OH) groups, whilst the band at 1057 cm−1 corresponds to the NO or SO stretching modes of interlayer nitrate and/or sulfate anions, respectively [32,33]. Above all, the structure of NiFe–LDH was finally determined based on the above elements and their bonding analysis. The three–electrode testing system was used to investigate the OER performance of the integrated electrodes. Fig. 3a and b show that all the SSFF@NiFe LDH electrodes exhibit superior potential in catalyzing the OER than blank SSFF. The difference in mass loading would slightly affect the catalytic properties of the composite electrodes. The overpotential (η) of the SSFF@NiFe LDH–3 electrode is as low as 198 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, significantly lower than that of the commercial SSFF+RuO2 electrode (316 mV). Additionally, the current density of the SSFF@NiFe LDH–3 electrode can reach to 100 and 300 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 240 and 260 mV, respectively. A low Tafel slop of 31.6 mV dec−1 indicated the fast OER kinetic of the SSFF@NiFe LDH–3 (Fig. 3c). The NiFe LDH catalyst has synergetic effect with the SSFF substrate in providing sufficient catalytic active sites. In fact, the OER catalytic performance of the SSFF@NiFe LDH–3 electrode is comparable with NiFe LDH catalysts as illustrated in Table S1 (SI). The good OER catalytic performance of the SSFF@NiFe LDH–3 electrode could be attributed to the high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and the low interfacial charge–transfer resistance (Figs. S4 and S5, SI). The influence of molar ratio of Ni/Fe in the precursor solution on the catalytic performance has also been investigated and results are shown in Fig. S6 (SI). The optimized molar ratio of Ni/Fe is 0.8: 0.2, which has been also reported by many researchers [30,34,35]. The stability of SSFF@NiFe LDH for OER was characterized by chronoamperometry testing performed at a constant overpotential of 300 mV. The obtained results revealed that the SSFF@NiFe LDH catalyst can maintain a stable current density of 33 mA cm2 after 10 h operation (Fig. 3d), suggesting its good stability. The inset SEM image of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode after the long–time test shows that the standing nanosheets structure can be well maintained, indicating its excellent structural stability. Meanwhile, the LSV curves overlap very well before and after 1000 cycles of CV measurement (Fig. S7, SI). Besides the excellent OER catalytic performance, SSFF@NiFe LDH also showed certain HER catalytic activity in 1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. S8 (SI), the overpotential of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode at 10 mA cm−2 is −0.225 V vs RHE, indicating some HER catalytic activity. Moreover, the SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode exhibited good bifunctional catalytic activities towards OER and HER in the simulated alkaline seawater. Fig. 3e shows the OER and HER LSV curves of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode in 1 M KOH solution with and without 0.5 M NaCl. Without iR compensation, the potential difference for OER and HER at 10 mA cm−2 is 1.72 V. After adding NaCl had almost no influence on the catalytic activity as well as the catalytic stability of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode (Fig. S9, SI). The well salt–resistance of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode indicates its great potential in the seawater electrolysis. Impelled by the good bifunctional catalytic activity, the SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode was employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 4a, the SSFF@NiFe LDH//SSFF@NiFe LDH electrolyzer exhibits the same catalytic activity in 1 M KOH aqueous solution with and without 0.5 M NaCl. The assembled SSFF@NiFe LDH//SSFF@NiFe LDH only required 1.76 and 1.90 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Also, the good salt–resistance of SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode shows stable current density in alkaline seawater electrolyte. There is no decay of current density obtained after a continuous electrolysis for 10 h at 1.85 V (Fig. 4b). Therefore, good salt–resistance as well as catalytic stability indicate NiFe LDH great potential in the seawater electrolysis and seawater batteries. 4 Conclusions Standing NiFe LDH nanosheets were successfully assembled on SSFF substrate at room temperature. The high specific surface area and porous structure could facilitate the contact between the active sites and the electrolyte and promote the transfer of reactants/products. Based on a synergistic effect, the integrated SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode exhibits excellent OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 198 and 260 mV at 10 and 300 mA cm−2, respectively. Particularly, a stable current density can be retained over 10 h at the overpotential of 300 mV. Essentially, besides high OER performance in alkaline aqueous solution, SSFF@NiFe LDH electrode also displayed good salt resistance in alkaline seawater. This work provided a facile method to construct NiFe LDH nanosheets on SSFF substrate, which can be used in many fields for energy storage and conversion.
