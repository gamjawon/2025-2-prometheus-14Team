Effects of supports and solvents on reactivity Takuzo Funabiki*, Hedeyuki 0hashi, Tsunemi Sugimoto and Satohiro Yoshida Department of Hydrocarbon Chemistry and Division of Molecular Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto (Japan) (Received February 21, 1991; accepted May 24, 1991) Abstract Dehydrogenation of hydroxybenzenes such as 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) and t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) by MCI. (FeCl3, CUCl2, MnC12, CoClz) with 02 in aprotic organic solvents is greatly promoted by using the MCI catalysts supported on metal oxides such as Si0z and AIz03. In the reaction of 3,5-DTBC, high activity is attained by the FeC13/Si02 and FeC13/Ca(OH)2 catalysts in THF. In the former catalyst the oxidation is catalyzed by the active species in the liquid phase formed by elution from supports, but in the latter probably by the surface active species. In the reaction of TBHQ, high activity is attained by the FeC)3/Y-A1203 catalyst in CHZCIZ, in which case the reaction is catalyzed by the surface active species. Effects of catalyst preparation method, supports and solvents on the promotion of the oxidation are discussed. Introduction The oxidation of hydroxybenzenes has attracted interest for many years, as quinones are important materials not only in synthetic and industrial chemistry, but also in biological systems, e.g. in the processes of electrontransfer, metabolism, metal transport, etc. We have examined the catalytic activity of nonheme iron complexes for oxygenation of catechols in a fashion similar to catechol dioxygenases, and found that the complex prepared with FeC13, bipyridine, and pyridine in THF catalyzes the oxygenative cleavage of the aromatic ring of 3,5-DTBC in a fashion similar to the enzyme [1, 21. However, in the model system, the main product is 3,5-di-t-butyl-o-benzoquinone (3,5-DTBQ) rather than the oxygenation products. In order to control the formation of the quinone, it is important to understand the factors promoting the oxidation of hydroxybenzenes without aromatic ring cleavage in organic solvents. Dehydrogenation of, hydroxybenzenes is catalyzed by many kinds of catalysts, but little is reported with transition metal complexes. Recently, *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 408 the reaction of hydroxybenzenes, in particular catechols, with iron complexes has been extensively studied [ 3-15 ]. The aim of these studies was not to optimize the catalytic system for the selective oxidation to quinone, but rather to clarify the structures and the reactivity of the phenolato or catecholatoiron complexes as related to the phenomena in biological systems. Previously we have found that some transition metal acetylacetonates catalyze the oxidation of 3,5-DTBC in organic solvent, but iron acetylacetonate exhibits no catalytic activity [ 16 ]. However, we have found also that FeC13 catalyzes the oxidation if metal oxide supports are added to the solution in situ [ 17 ]. We report here the novel effect of the supported metal chloride catalysts on the selective oxidation of hydroxybenzenes to quinones in more detail. Although many works have been reported on the catalytic activity of heterogenized complexes [ 181, little concerning the effect of the heterogenized catalysts on the promotion of the oxidation of hydroxybenzenes has been reported [ 191. We focus here on the activity of FeC13 as related to the oxygenation of catechols, and report the effect of the supports, the preparation method and solvents on the catalytic activity. Experimental Materials 3,5-Di-t-butylcatechol (Aldrich), t-butylhydroquinone (Wako), and methylhydroquinone (MHQ) were purified by recrystallization before use. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dichloromethane were refluxed in the presence of LiAlH4, and CaH2, respectively, and distilled and stored under Ar. Absence of peroxide in THF was verified with KI solution. FeC13 (Merck), CUC12 (Nakarai), MnC12 - 4H20 (Nakarai) and COC12 (Nakarai) were used without further purification. Commercially available supports, Si02, y-A1203, charcoal, Zr02, MgO, Mg(OH)2, CaO, Ca(OH)Z and Ti02, were pulverized to less than 200 mesh and dried at 150 C in vacuo for 3 h. Preparation of supported catalysts Catalysts were prepared either by stirring metal chlorides with supports in situ or by the impregnation method. The content of metal chlorides was 0.25 mmol and 9 wt.% on the supports. In a typical case of the impregnation method, FeC13 (0.25 mmol, 0.0406 g) and supports (0.4060 g) were stirred in 20 ml of THF for 2 h. THF was evaporated at room temperature in vacuo, and then dried at 150 C for 4 h in vacuo. Oxidation reaction Oxidation was performed in a 30 ml flask under an oxygen atmosphere at 25 C. The reaction was started either by adding the solvent containing MCL (0.25 mmol) to a mixture of hydroxybenzene (1 mmol) and support or by adding the solvent to a mixture of hydroxybenzene and the supported catalyst. THF or CH2Cl2 (20 ml) was used as solvent, and the solution was 409 stirred magnetically. Aliquots of the reaction solution (1 ml) were diluted with CH2C12 and washed with 2 N HCl. The CH2C12 extract was quantitatively analyzed by HPLC using biphenyl or naphthalene as an internal reference. The aqueous solution was used to analyze the concentration of metal species eluted from the supports by the EDTA titration method. Measurements of electronic spectra Aliquots of the reaction solution under 02 or N2 were filtered, and the spectra were taken on the Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Results Effect of metal chlorides Table 1 shows the results of oxidation of 3,5-DTBC catalyzed by FeC13, CUC12, MnC12 and COC12 in the presence and absence of Si02. In the absence of Si02, the yield of 3,5-DTBQ was very low. The use of Si02-supported catalysts gave a much higher yield of 3,5-DTBQ, and the reactivity decreased in the order FeC13 > MnC12 > CUC12 > COCl2. The analysis of the eluted metal species in solution after the reaction indicated that the nearly half of the supported metal chlorides is eluted from Si02 after the oxidation. Effect of supports Table 2 shows the effects of the different kinds of support on the oxidation of 3,5-DTBC catalyzed by supported FeC13 catalysts. In comparison with the low catalytic activity of FeC13, the catalyst prepared in situ by addition of Si02 exhibited the higher activity. The catalysts prepared by the impregnation method were more effective, and those dried at 150 C were more active TABLE 1 Oxidation of 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol by the supported MCI, catalysts in THFa Catalysts' Time Yield of 3,5-DTBQ` Fe 3+ eluted\" MCI (h) (mol Yo) (mmol) FeCl3 24 18 0.25 FeC13/Si02 2 94 0.17 CUC12 24 17 0.25 CUCl2/Si02 5 83 0.20 MnCl2 - 41-120 24 8 0.25 MnCl2 /Si02 2 90 0.16 COC12 24 16 0.25 C0Cl2/Si02 5 54 0.12 a3,5-DTBC (1 mmol), MCI, on supports (0.25 mmol), THF (20 ml), under 02, at 25 C.

The catalytic activity in THF was higher than in CHZC12. Compared with the Si02-supported catalysts, the catalytic activities of A1203-supported catalysts were lower in THF and higher in CHZC12. Charcoal and MgO were not effective, but CaO was effective for promotion of the reaction. Figure 1 shows the reactivity of FeC13/Ca0 in comparison with FeC13/SiO2- In contrast to the case of FeC13/SiO2, the reactivity of FeC13/Ca0 was very low in the initial stage, but gradually increased. The effect of H20 formed in the reaction was studied by addition of HZO and by using FeC13/Ca(OH)2 catalyst. Reactivity was very high in both cases. The concentration of Fe 3+ eluted into the solution was relatively high when Si02 was used, but fairly low in the cases of other supports. As shown in Fig. 2, the liquid portion separated in the course of the oxidation reaction by the FeC13/SiO2catalyst exhibited catalytic activity similar to that containing the solid catalyst. The liquid portion of the THF solution of FeCl3/Si02 and 3,5-DTBC stirred under N2 also exhibited similar reactivity, but that obtained from the solution stirred in the absence of 3,5-DTBC under OZ showed low activity. 411 100 e 5 60 m E A v~ ri o a 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Time/min Fig. 1.

Figure 5 shows the effect of the repeated use of the FeCl3/y-A1203 catalyst in CHZCl2. The catalytic activity of the supported catalysts decreased with repeated use, but was regenerated by drying at 150 C after filtration. Discussion Previously we studied the oxidation of 3,5-DTBC with oxygen catalyzed by metal acetylacetonates M(acac)2 in organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile) and found that the catalytic activity decreases in the order Mn > Co > Cu > Ni Fe (16 ]. In contrast to the high activity of the manganese complex, the iron complex does not form 3,5-DTBQ. The order of the reactivity parallels that of the redox potential of metal ions (Co > Mn > Fe > Cu). When the oxidation is performed with metal chlorides in acetonitrile, no 3,5-DTBQ is formed. As shown in Table 1, metal chlorides also exhibit low activity in THF, but the oxidation is greatly promoted by using silica-supported metal chloride catalysts. Interestingly, FeC13/SiO2 exhibits the highest catalytic activity. The dependence of the reactivity on the metal ion, i.e. FeC13 > MnC12 > CUC12 > COCl2, does not parallel the redox potential, suggesting the formation of active species by the interaction of metal chlorides with supports and an oxidation mechanism different from that of the metal acetylacetonates. The effect of the metal oxide supports for promotion of the oxidation in THF is in the order Ca0 > Si02 > y-A1203, Zr02 Mg0 (Table 2). As for 415 the high promotion effect of the CaO catalyst, the characteristic mode of formation of the quinone (Fig. 1), and the activity of FeC13/CaO+H20, as high as that of FeCl3/Ca(OH)Z, indicate that Ca(OH)2 is formed on the surface of CaO during the reaction. The high activity of Ca(OH)2 suggests the importance of the basic character of the support, which is effective for deprotonation of catechol. However, the basic character is not the only factor which explains the promotion effect of supports, e.g. the high activity of Si02 (higher than y-A1203) and the low activity of Mg(OH)Z and MgO. One of the questions in the liquid-phase heterogeneous reaction is whether the reaction proceeds on the surface of the solid catalyst or in the homogeneous phase. In the present system, the Fe\" ion is eluted from certain supported catalysts during the reaction, and its concentration is dependent on the support and solvent. In general, the concentration of eluted Fe 3+ is higher in THF than in CHZC12, parallel to the solubility of FeC13- In contrast to CHZC12, THF must play a role as a ligand to stabilize the active species in solution. Oxidation in the heterogeneous phase is also suggested by the high activity of catalysts from which little Fe 3+ is eluted, and shown more clearly by the oxidation of hydroquinones (TBHQ, MHQ) than that of 3,5-DTBC (Table 3). The concentration of Fe3+ eluted after oxidation of hydroquinones is much less than that of 3,5-DTBC, and no Fe 3+ is detected in CH2C12 in the oxidation of hydroquinones. As shown in Fig. 3, the oxidation does not proceed in the liquid CH2Cl2 portion obtained from the S'02-supported catalyst system, indicating that the oxidation proceeds on the surface. As for the mechanism of intermediate formation, it has been reported that a [Fe(OH)]2+ species rather than [Fe(OH)213+ is active in the aqueous solution, as shown by eqns. (1)-(3), where H2Cat, HCat and Cat denote catechol, monodentate catecholate or semiquinonate, and chelate catecholate, respectively [7, 12, 151. [Fe ]3+ +HZO ~ [Fe(OH)]2+ +H+ (1) [Fe(OH)]2++HZCat [Fe(Cat)]++H20+H+ (2) [Fe(OH)]2+ +HZCat [Fe(CatH)]Z+ +H20 (3) [Fe]3++HZCat -- [Fe(CatH)]2++H+ (4) [Fe]3++HZCat [Fe(Cat)]++2H+ (5) As shown in Table 4, the importance of the [Fe(OH)]2+ species is suggested by the increase in the relative intensity of the band near 700 nm and in the yield of 3,5-DTBQ, with the exception of Fe(OH)3 which is hardly soluble in THF. The liquid portion of FeC13/SiO2, on the other hand, exhibits a much stronger intensity of the band and higher activity. Since formation of [Fe(OH)12+ by eqn. (1) is less probable in aprotic solvents, the deprotonation promoted by the supports to form an intermediate (eqns. (4), (5)) is more probable. The high reactivity of the Ca(OH)2 and Si02 systems supports this reaction. 416 In contrast to the oxidation by metal acetylacetonates, in which the reaction proceeds without forming intermediate catecholate complexes [ 161, the formation of intermediates here is shown by the fact that the high activity of the solution is obtained by stirring FeC13/SiO2 only in the presence of 3,5-DTBC and by the visible spectra of the liquid solution in Fig. 4. A complex exhibiting a band at 711 nm is formed and decomposes gradually under OZ to give 3,5-DTBQ. The formation of the intermediate is greatly promoted by the presence of Si02- Since 650 nn is reported for the semiquinonatoiron complex. Fe(3,5-DTBSQ)3 (3,5-DTBSQ:3,5-di-t-butyl-o-benzosemiquinonate) [13], the complex which exhibits the 711 nm band can be a semiquinonato-iron complex, but a catecholato-iron complex is also a probable species [6]. The fact that the catalytic activity increases in the order (FeC13 without Si02) `~< (FeC13 + Si02) < (FeCl3/Si02 dried at room temperature) < (FeC13/SiO2 dried at 150 C) indicates that the stronger interaction of FeCl3 with Si02 is important for the formation of the active species. Probably the Si-OH group on the silica surface plays an important role in the formation of the active species, because the FeC13/SiO2 catalyst treated at 500 C showed very low activity. Spectroscopic data are necessary for discussion of the structure and electronic state of FeC13 modified by a support [20]. The possible processes for the formation of quinone (Q) are: [Fe(CatH)]2+ +OZ [Fe(CatH)(OZ)12+ (6) [Fe(CatH)(02)I2+ ---* [Fe 13+ +Q+H02- (7) [Fe(CatH)]2++[Fe]3+--) [Fe 12++Q+H+ (8) [Fe(Cat)]+ + [Fej3+ -j [Fe]z+ +Q (9) [Fe(CatH)]z+ --> [Felz+ +CatH' (10) CatH'+ [Fe13+ --~ [Fe]2+ +Q+H+ (11) Reactions (6) and (7) have been proposed for a manganese complex [5]. The reactions include the oxidation of the intermediate species with OZ and the direct regeneration of Fe 3+, but there is a question whether the mechanism is applicable to the iron system. Reaction (8) or (9) includes the oxidation of the intermediate species by Fe 3+ [15]. Reactions (10) and (11) include the intermediate formation of a semiquinone radical [71. In the reactions (8)-(11), Fe 2+ should be re-oxidized to Fe 3+ by oxygen, but mechanism of the regeneration of Fe 3+ from Fe' by oxygen in aprotic solvent is not clear, especially on the surface on which formation of a Ecperoxy iron species may be difficult. In the case of oxidation on the surface, reactions (10) and (11) seem to be more probable than reactions (8) and (9), because the latter require the attack of Fe3+ on the intermediate. In this process, the support which makes labile the [Fe(CatH) ]2+ species on the surface, accelerates the reaction; the stronger the phenolato (or catecholato)-iron bond is, the weaker the 417 iron-support bond may become. 1,4-Hydroquinones which coordinate as a monodentate ligand favor the oxidation on the surface because the phenolate-iron bond is not strong. The coordination of the catecholate ligand in the chelate form brings about the weaker iron-support bond, resulting in the elution of Fe\" from the surface to solution. The Fe\" -Si02 bond is weakest in the supported catalysts used here, as seen in the elution of Fe\" even in the reaction of TBHQ in THF. From the viewpoint of preparation of oxidation catalysts for hydroxybenzenes with 02 in organic solvents, it is important to know whether the solid catalysts retain their activity over repeated use. The results in Fig. 5 indicate that the catalytic activity decreases with repeated use but is recovered by treatment of the catalyst at 150 C. The deactivation suggests that the structure of the active species on the surface changes during the reaction. Reactivation by treatment at 150 C suggests that the structural change of the surface active species is caused by water formed in the oxidation, or by interaction with the reactant. Deactivation may also occur if reoxidation of the Fe\" species on the surface proceeds less readily than that in the homogeneous phase. The treatment of the used catalyst at 150 C may be effective for the regeneration of the active Fe 3+ species. Apart from the uncertainty of the oxidation mechanism and the phase in which the reaction proceeds (either homogeneous or heterogeneous), the present method is useful for the oxidation of hydroxybenzenes in organic solvent with 02. In particular, the promotion of the reaction simply by addition of supports in situ provides a convenient method of preparation of heterogenized catalysts with enhanced activity. This indicates that the use of catalysts prepared by the impregnation method is not always necessary for obtaining activity similar to the heterogenized catalysis. The method may also be applicable to other reaction systems. References 1 T. Funabiki, H. Sakamoto, S. Yoshida and K. Tarama, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., (1979) 754; T. Funabiki, A. Mizoguchi, T.

Dehydrogenation of hydroxybenzenes such as 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) and t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) by MCl n (FeCl3, CuCl2, MnCl2, CoCl2) with O2 in aprotic organic solvents is greatly promoted by using the MCl n catalysts supported on metal oxides such as SiO2 and Al2O3. In the reaction of 3,5-DTBC, high activity is attained by the FeCl3/SiO2 and FeCl3/Ca(OH)2 catalysts in THF. In the former catalyst the oxidation is catalyzed by the active species in the liquid phase formed by elution from supports, but in the latter probably by the surface active species. In the reaction of TBHQ, high activity is attained by the FeCl3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in CH2Cl2, in which case the reaction is catalyzed by the surface active species.
