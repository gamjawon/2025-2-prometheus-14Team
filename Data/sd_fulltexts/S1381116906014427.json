Enhancement of selectivity for preferential CO oxidation over SO2-pretreated Ru/Al2O3 catalyst by the presence of sulfur compounds Hidenobu Wakita a ⁎ Tatsuya Takeguchi b Wataru Ueda b a Living Environment Development Center, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.

The preferential CO oxidation on a monolith Ru/Al2O3 catalyst pretreated with SO2 in the reactant gas was investigated in the presence/absence of 0.21–20ppm sulfur compounds (SO2 or H2S). In the presence of 2.1ppm sulfur compound, CO was preferentially oxidized over the SO2-pretreated catalyst at 150°C. On the other hand, in the absence of sulfur compounds, the H2 oxidation was promoted. By in situ IR measurements, multicarbonyl species and SO4 2− species were found on Ru in the presence of SO2. The presence of multicarbonyl species at a high frequency (2154cm−1) and that of SO4 2− species on Ru suggested that Ru was oxidized. Since the rate of CO oxidation was low on oxidized Ru, the selectivity for CO oxidation was low over the SO2-pretreated catalyst in the absence of sulfur compounds. On the other hand, the increase in the selectivity in the presence of sulfur compounds suggested that weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds suppressed the migration of dissociatively adsorbed H atom on Ru or decreased the H atoms next to adsorbed O atom for the H2 oxidation. Graphical abstract The preferential CO oxidation on a Ru/Al2O3 catalyst pretreated with SO2 in the reactant gas was investigated in the presence/absence of sulfur compound (SO2 or H2S). In the presence of 2.1ppm sulfur compound, CO was preferentially oxidized at 150°C. On the other hand, in the absence of sulfur compounds, the H2 oxidation was promoted. Keywords Preferential CO oxidation SO2 H2S Ru/Al2O3 catalyst In situ IR 1 Introduction H2 is expected to be one of the clean energy resources, if it can be produced from the solar energy, natural energy, and bioenergy without CO2 evolution. However, the infrastructure for domestic use of H2 has not been developed. To consume energy effectively, residential polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) co-generation systems using natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, or kerosene as H2 sources have attracted much attention. The fuel processor of the system normally comprises a desulfurizer, a steam reformer, a shift converter, and a preferential CO oxidation (PROX) unit. Since just a small amount of CO poisons the anode catalyst for PEFC, the CO concentration in the reformed fuel gas must be reduced to less than 10ppm by the water–gas shift reaction and the PROX. The stoichiometric [O2]/[CO] ratio is 0.5 for the CO oxidation; however, it is necessary to supply excess O2 to achieve high CO conversion for the PROX in H2-rich gas [1,2]. Thus the PROX is usually conducted at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5–2.5, though excess O2 consumes H2 and the selectivity for CO oxidation is as low as 20–33%. For residential use, long-term durability over 10 years is required [3]; however, it has not been ensured yet. In addition, only a few studies on the deactivation of the PROX catalyst have been reported [4–6], since the PROX is not needed for phosphoric acid fuel cell systems. For the PROX, contaminants in air, such as SO2 and H2S, may deactivate the catalyst. In addition, for autothermal reforming of liquid fuels, which usually contain sulfur compounds, H2S is supplied to the subsequent catalysts [7]. Though Cu–ZnO catalysts for the water–gas shift reaction have large absorption capacity for H2S, some catalysts cannot absorb H2S. Therefore, we have investigated the influence of sulfur compounds (SO2 and H2S) over the monolith Ru/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [8]. The supply of 4.3–48ppm sulfur compounds to the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst for 100–350min decreased the CO conversion. Most of the sulfur compounds were oxidized to SO4 2− species, which migrated to the support. During the SO2 poisoning, parts of the Ru sites strongly adsorbed the SO4 2− species, and the CO oxidation was suppressed. In some cases of practical use, contaminated air is supplied to the PROX catalysts for a long term. In addition, the composition of the contaminants is not always the same. From this point of view, the Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was employed for the reaction in the presence of SO2 for a long term (SO2 pretreatment), and then the sulfur compound was intermittently supplied to the SO2-pretreated catalyst. In this work, the first SO2 poisoning is designated as the SO2 pretreatment, though the reaction conditions of the pretreatment are the same as those for the PROX, except for the coexistent SO2. Interestingly, the SO2-pretreated catalyst showed significant changes in the selectivity for CO oxidation caused by sulfur compounds. In this study, the catalytic behavior after the pretreatment is reported in detail, and the mechanisms are discussed on the basis of in situ IR spectra. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method described in detail elsewhere [8]. By impregnating a θ-Al2O3 support with an aqueous solution of RuNO(NO3) x , 2.0wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst powder thus obtained was supported on cordierite honeycombs (20mm diameter; 10mm thickness; 400cell/in.2) with an Al2O3–sol binder. The prepared monolith Ru/Al2O3 catalyst with Ru loading of 1.6g/l was employed for transient response tests in a fixed bed reactor. For the in situ IR measurements, 3.8wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst powder was prepared. 2.2 Reaction tests Catalytic activities were measured in a fixed bed reactor. The reactant gas was 51.5vol.% H2, 0.3vol.% CO, 12.9vol.% CO2, 0.5vol.% O2, 6.0vol.% N2, and 28.8vol.% H2O at an [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5, which simulates the steam-reformed natural gas after the shift converter. The pretreatment reaction was conducted in the presence of 20ppm SO2 in the reactant gas at GHSV=9260h−1 and ca. 150°C for 60h. After the pretreatment, the above-mentioned reactant gas without sulfur compounds was continuously fed to the SO2-pretreated Ru/Al2O3 catalyst at ca. 150°C for 15–23h. Then 5.0–500ppm SO2 or H2S diluted with N2 was intermittently added to the reactant gas. The concentration of the sulfur compound was 0.21–20ppm in the reactant gas, which was corresponding to 8.7–830ppm in air. When the sulfur compound was not added to the reactant gas, N2 was fed instead. The reaction was usually conducted at GHSV=9260h−1 and ca. 150°C. The reaction temperatures were measured with a thermocouple in contact with the top of the catalyst bed. When the [O2]/[CO] ratio was changed, the air flow rate was changed. The method of the gas composition analysis was described in detail earlier [8]. The selectivity for CO oxidation was defined by the following equation: S={(inlet CO concentration−outlet CO concentration−outlet CH4 concentration)/2}×100/(inlet O2 concentration−outlet O2 concentration). However, the outlet CH4 concentration was negligible under any conditions in this study. The temperature dependence of catalytic activities was also measured in the presence/absence of 2.1ppm sulfur compounds by lowering the catalyst temperature stepwise from 200 to 90°C. 2.3 Catalyst characterization IR spectra were obtained with an FTIR spectrometer (FTIR 8200, Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a DRIFT apparatus (model 0030-103, Spectra-Tech Inc.) having CaF2 windows. The 3.8wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst without the SO2 pretreatment was reduced at 200°C for 30min in a 5vol.% H2/He flow, and cooled to 150°C. After the background spectrum was taken in a He flow, a spectrum was taken at 150°C in a reactant gas flow (gas composition (I): 75.5vol.% H2, 0.5vol.% CO, 19.0vol.% CO2, 0.7vol.% O2, 2.7vol.% N2, and 1.6vol.% H2O). Next, SO2 diluted with N2 was added to the reactant gas for 150min (SO2 pretreatment), and the IR spectra were recorded. The gas composition during the SO2 pretreatment was 65.6vol.% H2, 0.4vol.% CO, 16.5vol.% CO2, 0.6vol.% O2, 15.5vol.% N2, 1.4vol.% H2O, and 66ppm SO2 (gas composition (II)). After the SO2 pretreatment, the reaction (gas composition (I)) was continuously carried out for 70min. Then SO2 was re-supplied to the SO2-pretreated catalyst (gas composition (II)). The CO adsorption on the pretreated/fresh catalysts was also conducted at 50°C by the pulse method on an automatic gas adsorption apparatus (R6015, Okura Riken Co. Ltd.). Before the measurements, the catalysts were reduced at 200°C for 15min in a H2 flow. 3 Results 3.1 Changes in the catalytic activity caused by SO2 As shown in Table 1 , the fresh monolith Ru/Al2O3 catalyst without SO2 pretreatment showed ∼100% conversions of both CO and O2 at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5 and 155°C (I), and neither of conversions changed 0.5h after the start of the pretreatment with 20ppm SO2 (II) even in the presence of SO2. However, the CO and O2 conversions decreased to 75.0% and 37.7% at 60h, respectively (III). In addition, the temperature of the top of the catalyst bed decreased from 155 to 142°C at 60h due to the suppression of the oxidations of CO and H2. As described above, the SO2 pretreatment for 60h was conducted. Then the supply of SO2 was interrupted and the reaction was continuously conducted over the SO2-pretreated catalyst in the absence of SO2 for 22h. The O2 conversion increased to 99.4% at 22h, though the CO conversion decreased further to 65.5% (IV). The catalyst temperature increased to 151°C with an increase in the O2 conversion. Therefore, the interruption of SO2 promoted the H2 oxidation. Next, 20ppm SO2 was re-supplied, which increased the CO conversion with a decrease in the O2 conversion. A high CO conversion (95.7%) was attained with a low O2 conversion (56.0%) (V) 1.5h after the resumption of the SO2 supply. Thus the selectivity for CO oxidation significantly increased to 52.2%. However, a long-term supply of 20ppm SO2 (24h) gradually decreased the CO and O2 conversions to 77.1% and 45.4%, respectively (VI). Interestingly, the selectivity was very high (56.2%) even at this moment. The interruption of SO2 promoted the H2 oxidation again. Next, SO2 of low concentration (2.1ppm) was supplied. A high CO conversion (95.1%) and a high selectivity (46.0%) were attained in the presence of SO2 even 33h after the start of the supply of SO2 of low concentration (VII). In summary, the H2 oxidation was promoted in the absence of SO2 over the SO2-pretreated catalyst (IV), while CO was preferentially oxidized in the presence of SO2 and unreacted O2 was exhausted without consuming H2, which gave high selectivities (V, VII). However, the CO conversion decreased little by little with high selectivities kept, when SO2 of high concentration (20ppm) was supplied for a long term (V, VI). On the other hand, in the presence of SO2 of low concentration (2.1ppm), the high CO conversion was kept for a long term (VII). To elucidate the effect of the Al2O3 support (θ or α), a Ru/α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ru loading of 1.6g/l was pretreated with SO2. The interruption of SO2 promoted the H2 oxidation, and CO was selectively oxidized in the presence of 20ppm SO2. The point is that the catalytic behavior did not depend on the support, but on the catalyst metal of Ru. 3.2 Influence of sulfur compounds on the activities of the SO2-pretreated catalyst To investigate the influence of the SO2 concentration on the activities of the catalyst pretreated with SO2 for 60h, 0.21–20ppm SO2 was intermittently added to the reactant gas for a short term (50–100min). The reaction was conducted over the SO2-pretreated catalyst at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5 and 150°C and the results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1 . Table 2 shows the catalytic activities 90min after the start of sulfur compound supply, except those in the presence of 0.21ppm sulfur compounds. Some tests were repeated, and the high reproducibility was confirmed. In the presence of SO2 of very low concentration (0.21ppm), the CO conversion increased and the O2 conversion slightly decreased (Table 2) although conversions were unstable and fluctuated. Thus, the selectivity for CO oxidation showed relatively high value of 30–37%. In the presence of SO2 of low concentration (2.1ppm), the CO conversion was as high as 98.4%, and the O2 conversion was as low as 62.4% (Table 2 and Fig. 1(a)). As a result, the selectivity for CO oxidation increased to 52.2%. After SO2 was stopped, the CO conversion immediately decreased to ∼60% with an increase in the O2 conversion to ∼100%, which showed that the H2 oxidation was promoted. The presence of SO2 of high concentration (20ppm) also led to similar behavior within a short period of 90min (Table 2). Next, the influence of the H2S concentration (0.21–20ppm) on the activity of the SO2-pretreated catalyst was examined. The results are also shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1(b), H2S of low concentration (2.1ppm) increased the CO conversion and the selectivity as was the case of SO2 of low concentration (2.1ppm) (Fig. 1(a)). However, the interruption of H2S supply resulted in a slower decrease in the CO conversion than the interruption of SO2. We have already reported that the sulfur compounds were oxidized to SO4 2− species, which migrated to the support [8]. Therefore, these results indicate that H2S was oxidized more slowly to SO4 2− species than SO2. In the presence of H2S of very low concentration (0.21ppm), the CO conversion also increased with a decrease in the O2 conversion, though they fluctuated as was the case of SO2 of very low concentration (0.21ppm) (Table 2). In the presence of H2S of high concentration (20ppm), however, both CO and O2 conversions significantly decreased (Fig. 1(c)), unlike in the case of SO2 of high concentration (20ppm) (Table 2). This also indicates that weakly adsorbed H2S or S2− species was more slowly oxidized to SO4 2− species than SO2 and accumulated on Ru, resulting in the rapid deactivation. After H2S of high concentration was stopped, the O2 conversion gradually increased, and the CO conversion once increased and then decreased. Both CO and O2 conversions returned to the same as those before the H2S supply, 170min after the interruption of H2S supply. The changes in the CO conversions after the interruption of H2S of high concentration suggest that the CO conversion and the selectivity strongly depended on the coverage of the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds, which were slowly oxidized after the interruption of H2S supply. The pretreatment was also conducted by H2S instead of SO2. The interruption of H2S supply promoted the H2 oxidation, and the sulfur compound re-supply enhanced the selectivity [9]. This also suggests that H2S was oxidized to SO4 2− species. 3.3 Dependence of the catalytic activities on the SO2 pretreatment condition The dependence of the activities of SO2-pretreated catalysts in the absence of sulfur compounds on the amount of supplied SO2 for the pretreatment was investigated by changing the period of pretreatment. In Fig. 2 , the abscissa presents the molar ratio of supplied SO2 to the Ru loading, where 30molS/molRu of SO2 corresponds to the pretreatment with 20ppm SO2 for 60h. The reaction was carried out at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5 and 150°C. The activities were measured at 15–23h after the SO2 pretreatment. The catalyst pretreated with 0.5molS/molRu of SO2 showed the same activity as the fresh one. However, the CO conversion significantly decreased to 86% at 2.0molS/molRu, and decreased further to 70% at 9.1molS/molRu. However, the CO conversion of the catalyst at 30molS/molRu was slightly lower than that at 9.1molS/molRu. On the other hand, the O2 conversion remained ∼100% irrespective of the amount of SO2. Thus, the changes in the selectivity strongly depended on the CO conversion. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the activities of the SO2-pretreated catalyst in the presence of SO2 of low concentration (2.1ppm) on the amount of supplied SO2 for the pretreatment. After the pretreatment followed by the reaction for 15–23h in the absence of SO2, SO2 was re-supplied and the activity 1.5h after the start of SO2 was plotted against the molar ratio of supplied SO2 to the Ru loading. The catalyst at 2.0molS/molRu showed the same activity as that of the fresh one. The O2 conversion decreased to 60% at 30molS/molRu, though the CO conversion remained higher than 98%. Thus, the changes in the selectivity depended on those in the O2 conversion. At more than 9.1molS/molRu, both CO and O2 conversions changed by the presence/absence of SO2 of low concentration (Figs. 2 and 3). Fig. 4 shows the dependence of the nominal Ru dispersion estimated by the CO adsorption on the amount of supplied SO2 for the pretreatment. In this paper, the Ru dispersion was defined as the molar ratio of the amount of CO adsorbed to the amount of Ru loaded. The Ru dispersion after the reduction at 400°C in a H2 flow was lower than that after the reduction at 200°C, since SO4 2− species reversely spilled over from the support to Ru above 220°C as reported in our previous study [8]. Therefore, the Ru dispersion after the reduction at 200°C is shown in Fig. 4. Though the supplied SO2 at 0.5molS/molRu was 1.6 times as much as the surface Ru, the Ru dispersion slightly decreased from 31.7% to 26.4%. The Ru dispersion at 9.1molS/molRu decreased to 7.8%; however, the catalyst at 30molS/molRu maintained 2.3% of the Ru dispersion. Thus, even though a large amount of SO2 was supplied, migration of SO4 2− species to the support retained some active sites, and the Ru catalyst showed high tolerance to SO2. In addition, the rate of oxidation was fast enough to achieve 100% of O2 conversion over small numbers of active sites after the pretreatment. We have already reported that the mean size of Ru particles of a Ru catalyst (Ru loading, 3.1g/l) increased from 1.7 to 2.7nm by the poisoning with 48ppm SO2 for 8h from TEM images, though the nominal Ru dispersion significantly decreased from 34.3% to 1.8% [8]. The XPS for the catalyst at 9.1molS/molRu showed only S6+ species, which also supports the presence of SO4 2− species on Al2O3 and Ru. Therefore, it is implied that the decrease in the Ru dispersion was mainly caused by the SO4 2− species strongly adsorbed on the Ru surface. Figs. 2 and 4 indicate that a small amount of SO4 2− species strongly adsorbed on Ru selectively promoted the H2 oxidation in the absence of sulfur compounds. On the other hand, in the presence of SO2, the O2 conversion decreased when the number of active sites further decreased by the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds. We also checked the amount of residual sulfur on the catalyst at 9.1molS/molRu, and 28% of the total SO2 supplied was detected. Though the quantitative analysis of sulfur compounds in the effluent gas was difficult due to a high dew point (70°C), only SO2 was detected in the effluent gas when the dew point was low as in the case of in situ IR measurements to be given later (the dew point, 15°C). 3.4 Temperature dependence of the catalytic activities For practical use, it is preferable to reduce CO concentration in a wide temperature range. Thus the temperature dependence of the catalytic activities was investigated in the presence/absence of sulfur compounds of low concentration (2.1ppm) (Fig. 5 ). The catalyst pretreated for 60h showed low CO conversions in the absence of sulfur compounds at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5 (Fig. 5(a)), which indicates that the CO oxidation was suppressed by the SO4 2− species strongly adsorbed on the Ru particles. Though the fresh catalyst without the pretreatment showed constant selectivities (32–33%) at the temperature range between 120 and 190°C due to high CO conversions (>97%) and high O2 conversions (∼100%), the SO2-pretreated catalyst showed the maximum CO conversion and selectivity at 120°C in the absence of sulfur compounds. When we examined the activity of the SO2-pretreated catalyst for the reverse water–gas shift reaction in a reactant gas flow without CO and air (52.1vol.% H2, 13.0vol.% CO2, 4.1vol.% N2 and 30.8vol.% H2O), CO was not detected even at 200°C. Therefore, the reverse water–gas shift reaction did not cause the decrease in the CO conversion above 120°C. Therefore, supposedly the activation of CO was suppressed in the absence of sulfur compounds, and the H2 oxidation was enhanced with an increase in temperature, which consumed O2 in the upper stream of the catalyst bed. However, the SO2-pretreated catalyst showed very high CO conversions in the presence of sulfur compounds of low concentration (2.1ppm) especially between 145 and 175°C. At 145°C, O2 was not completely consumed (Fig. 5(b)), since the H2 oxidation was suppressed by the sulfur compounds weakly adsorbed on Ru. Above 175°C, O2 was completely consumed due to the increased rate of the H2 oxidation, so that the selectivity decreased. However, the CO conversions and selectivities in the presence of sulfur compounds were higher than those in the absence of sulfur compounds, which indicates that the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds suppressed the H2 oxidation even at high temperature. 3.5 Dependence of the catalytic activities on the [O2]/[CO] ratios Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the catalytic activities at 150°C on the [O2]/[CO] ratios. Over the fresh catalyst without the SO2 pretreatment, the CO conversion significantly decreased at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 0.8, though the O2 conversion was ∼100% at any [O2]/[CO] ratios (Fig. 6(a)). The selectivity increased with a decrease in the [O2]/[CO] ratios. Over the SO2-pretreated catalyst, the O2 conversion was also ∼100% in the absence of sulfur compounds at any [O2]/[CO] ratios; however, the selectivity was nearly constant (Fig. 6(b)). In other words, the ratio of the CO oxidation to the H2 oxidation in the upper stream of catalyst bed was constant irrespective of the changes in the O2 concentration. In the presence of 2.1ppm SO2, the O2 conversion of the SO2-pretreated catalyst was low at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5; however, it largely increased with a decrease in the [O2]/[CO] ratio from 1.5 to 1.1 (Fig. 6(c)). The CO conversion slightly decreased with a decrease in the [O2]/[CO] ratio from 1.5 to 1.1 and significantly decreased at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 0.8. At the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5, the selectivity for CO oxidation on the SO2-pretreated catalyst in the presence of 2.1ppm SO2 was the highest at 115°C as shown in Fig. 5(c). Similar tendency was also observed at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.1 (Table 3 ). In the presence of 2.1ppm SO2, the O2 conversion at 120°C was lower than that at 150°C, keeping relatively high CO conversions. So a very high selectivity (50.7%) was attained at 120°C at the low [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.1. It was five points higher than that (45.5%) of the fresh catalyst without the pretreatment under the same conditions, though the CO conversion was a little smaller than that of the fresh catalyst. 3.6 In situ IR measurements In the in situ IR apparatus, the 3.8wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst powder was pretreated with 66ppm SO2 at ca. 150°C in the reactant gas flow. Fig. 7 (a) shows the in situ IR spectra over the regions of the C–O stretching vibrations and the S–O stretching vibrations before the SO2 pretreatment (gas composition (I)). The CO bands arising from carbonyls adsorbed on Ru are generally divided into three groups: HF1 (high-frequency 1) bands at 2156–2133cm−1, HF2 bands at 2100–2060cm−1, and LF (low-frequency) bands at 2080–2000cm−1 [8–21]. It has been reported that the monocarbonyl species linearly adsorbed on Ru0 was characterized by the LF band at 2040cm−1 [12,19]. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the bands were observed at different frequencies of ca. 2030, 2000 and 1970cm−1 due to the differences in the oxidation states of Ru sites [19–23]. The band at ca. 1970cm−1 might also arise from bridge-adsorbed carbonyl species [22]. As shown in Fig. 7(b)–(d), broad absorption bands appeared at 1180 and 1260cm−1 during the SO2 pretreatment, and the band intensities increased with time on stream. As reported in our previous study [8], the band at 1180cm−1 was assigned to the SO4 2− species in bulk Al2(SO4)3, while the band at 1260cm−1 was attributed to the surface SO4 2− species on the Al2O3 support and the Ru particles. During the SO2 pretreatment, the HF2 band, which lay as a shoulder peak before the SO2 pretreatment, clearly appeared at 2068cm−1 with a decrease in the LF band intensities at ca. 1970 and 2030cm−1. It has been reported that the Ru n+(CO)2 dicarbonyls were characterized by a pair of the HF2 band at 2092–2045cm−1 and the LF band at 2038–1970cm−1 [21,24–35]. Therefore, it is considered that the presence of SO2 increased the band intensity of dicarbonyls and decreased the band intensity of monocarbonyls adsorbed on Ru at 2030cm−1. In addition, the HF1 band appeared at 2154cm−1 at 30min and the intensity increased with time on stream (Fig. 7(c)–(d)). It has been reported that Ru m+(CO)3 tricarbonyls were characterized by a pair of the HF1 and HF2 bands [20,21,35–37] and that multicarbonyls were formed by the disruption of the Ru–Ru bonding by anionic groups [19,20]. Thus, the band at 2154cm−1 was characterized by the tricarbonyls on the Ru sites oxidized by SO4 2− species. Thus, it has been found that the SO2 supply decreased the linearly adsorbed monocarbonyls, increased the dicarbonyls and developed the tricarbonyls. The IR spectrum of the catalyst pretreated with SO2 for 150min did not change even after the interruption of SO2 supply (Fig. 7(d) and (e)). When SO2 was re-supplied to the catalyst, the IR spectrum did not change. This indicates that the reactivity of carbonyls on the SO2-pretreated catalyst hardly changed by the interruption of SO2 supply and the SO2 re-supply. To check the influence of a long-term SO2 pretreatment on the IR spectra, the pellet 2.0wt% Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was pretreated with 21ppm SO2 for 139h in the fixed bed reactor. After it was confirmed that the catalyst showed changes in the selectivity in the presence/absence of sulfur compounds similar to those shown in Fig. 1, the catalyst was grounded, and the in situ IR spectrum was taken in the absence of sulfur compounds (gas composition (I)) (Fig. 7(f)). The dicarbonyls and tricarbonyls were observed as in the case of the in situ short-term SO2 pretreatment. Thus, the IR spectrum for the long-term SO2 pretreatment was essentially identical to those for the in situ short-term SO2 pretreatment, though it differed in the degree of poisoning. 4 Discussion Yokomizo et al. reported that the linearly adsorbed monocarbonyls were the most active species for the CO oxidation over a Ru/SiO2 catalyst [20]. In this study, the SO2 pretreatment decreased the linearly adsorbed monocarbonyls, disrupted the Ru–Ru bonding, and decreased the interaction between CO and Ru with a little higher oxidation state of Ru sites, which suppressed the activation of CO. As shown in Fig. 7(d) and (e), the interruption of SO2 supply did not restore the IR spectra over the region of the C–O stretching vibrations. This indicates that the oxidized Ru was not reduced after the interruption of SO2 supply and that the activation of CO was not restored. In other words, SO4 2− species strongly adsorbed on the oxidized Ru sites, which accumulated little by little during the SO2 pretreatment, were not removed even after the interruption of SO2 supply. Thus the CO oxidation was suppressed in the absence of SO2, and O2 was consumed in the upper stream of the catalyst bed by the H2 oxidation. The proposed reaction model in the absence of sulfur compounds is shown in Fig. 8 (a). The SO2 pretreatment decreased the linearly adsorbed carbonyls on Ru0 and decreased the CO coverage to promote the H2 oxidation, which had been suppressed on the fresh catalyst with high CO coverage [38]. The H2 oxidation might occur even over the partially oxidized Ru sites. Thus, the selectivity for CO oxidation decreased in the absence of sulfur compounds. In this case, CO was oxidized on the slightly remaining reduced Ru sites; however, the consumption of O2 in the upper stream of the catalyst bed resulted in a decrease in the CO conversion. On the other hand, in the presence of sulfur compounds, the sulfur compounds weakly adsorbed on the SO2-pretreated catalyst were slowly oxidized to SO4 2− species, most of which migrated to the support. The weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds probably covered the active sites, on which the H2 oxidation could occur in the absence of sulfur compounds. For the H2 oxidation on Ru catalysts, it has been reported that an H atom of an adsorbed H2 molecule formed an OH group with an adsorbed O atom and then the OH group reacted with a dissociatively adsorbed H atom to form H2O [39]. Assuming that the OH group reacts with an H atom adsorbed on another Ru site, two vacant Ru sites, both of which are located next to the adsorbed O atom, are needed for the H2 oxidation. On the other hand, only one vacant Ru site next to the adsorbed O atom is needed for the CO oxidation. If the coverage with the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds is high, it is probably difficult to give two vacant sites next to the adsorbed O atom for the H2 oxidation. In addition, the high coverage with the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds likely suppressed the migration of the H atom, though the CO oxidation occurs without the migration of CO. As a result, the H2 oxidation was strongly suppressed and the selectivity for CO oxidation increased. Fig. 8(b) shows the proposed reaction model in the presence of SO2 over the catalyst. The active sites for the CO oxidation were hardly affected by the presence of sulfur compounds in the reactant gas. When sulfur compounds of high concentration were fed for a long term (Table 1(V and VI)), the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds accumulated on the Ru particles and then suppressed the CO oxidation, keeping high selectivities for the CO oxidation. On the other hand, in the presence of SO2 of low concentration, high CO conversions were kept for a long term (Table 1(VII)), since the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds were also slowly oxidized to migrate to the support. However, sulfur compounds of very low concentration (0.21ppm) slightly increased the selectivity (Table 2). After the interruption of sulfur compound supply, they were oxidized to SO4 2− species, most of which migrated to the support. Therefore, the H2 oxidation was promoted again. 5 Conclusions The reaction behavior of the SO2-pretreated Ru/Al2O3 catalyst for the PROX was investigated in the presence/absence of sulfur compounds. The following conclusions are drawn: 1. After the catalyst was pretreated with SO2 for a long term, the H2 oxidation was promoted at ca. 150°C in the absence of sulfur compounds. On the other hand, in the presence of 2.1ppm sulfur compounds, the catalyst showed high selectivities (46–53%) with high CO conversions (>95%) at the [O2]/[CO] ratio of 1.5. 2. The in situ IR results showed that coexistent SO2 decreased the linearly adsorbed monocarbonyls, increased the dicarbonyls and developed the tricarbonyls. This suggests that the CO oxidation was suppressed by the SO4 2− species strongly adsorbed on Ru, which oxidized Ru. Thus, the H2 oxidation was promoted in the absence of sulfur compounds. In the presence of sulfur compounds, the H2 oxidation was suppressed by the weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds, which were slowly oxidized and migrated to the support.

        "dc:description": "The preferential CO oxidation on a monolith Ru/Al2O3 catalyst pretreated with SO2 in the reactant gas was investigated in the presence/absence of 0.21–20ppm sulfur compounds (SO2 or H2S). In the presence of 2.1ppm sulfur compound, CO was preferentially oxidized over the SO2-pretreated catalyst at 150°C. On the other hand, in the absence of sulfur compounds, the H2 oxidation was promoted. By in situ IR measurements, multicarbonyl species and SO4 2− species were found on Ru in the presence of SO2. The presence of multicarbonyl species at a high frequency (2154cm−1) and that of SO4 2− species on Ru suggested that Ru was oxidized. Since the rate of CO oxidation was low on oxidized Ru, the selectivity for CO oxidation was low over the SO2-pretreated catalyst in the absence of sulfur compounds. On the other hand, the increase in the selectivity in the presence of sulfur compounds suggested that weakly adsorbed sulfur compounds suppressed the migration of dissociatively adsorbed H atom on Ru or decreased the H atoms next to adsorbed O atom for the H2 oxidation.",
