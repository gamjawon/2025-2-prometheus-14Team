Box 440, H-6701 (Hungary) (Received July 24, 1992; accepted December 9, 1992 ) Abstract The liquid-phase oxidations of tetralin, cumene, cyclohexene and methylcyclohexane were investigated in the presence of water and different types of surfactants. It was found that water first increases, then decreases, the rate of oxidation. Aromatic compounds are oxidised more readily than non-aromatic ones. [ HZO ] . is mostly determined by the concentration of hydroperoxide present, and it does not depend on the nature of the hydrocarbon. H20 and D20 have similar catalytic effects; both inhibit the oxidation when applied in a larger excess. Anionic and non-ionic surfactants reduce the catalytic effect of water, because access to the hydroperoxide molecules by the water droplets is considerably hindered by the surrounding surfactant ions or molecules. In contrast, cationic surfactants catalyse the oxidation, their efficiencies largely depend on the nature of their anions. It is assumed that the water catalysis arises from the H-bonding interaction of the hydroperoxide with the discrete or less-associated water molecules. Water and onium ion have a joint catalytic effect. The onium-ion pair attacks at the more nucleophilic 0-atom of the hydroperoxide, while the outer 0-atom is activated by water, through H-bond formation. Key words: hydrocarbons; onium ion; oxidation; phase transfer catalyst; water catalysis Introduction It has long been known that the presence of water is essential for the 02 oxidation of some (if not all) combustible substances. It was observed by Dixon [ 1 ] that a perfectly dry CO + 02 gas mixture cannot be ignited either by an electric spark or by a glowing (white-hot) Pt spiral. No formation of N02 was found by Baker [2] in dry NO+OZ gas mixtures, etc. During the non-catalysed liquid-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, it has been observed by many authors that water present in a larger excess exerts an inhibitory effect. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one reference in *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 354 L.J Csanyi et al./J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 353-364 the literature [3] to the effect that the autoxidation of isopropylbenzene is enhanced by water. This finding, however, has not been reproduced. In this connection, it should be emphasized that metal ion-catalysed autoxidations cannot be considered here: in the presence of water, different aqua and hydroxo complexes are formed and the change in the oxidation rate is then due to the modification of the metal catalyst and not to a real catalytic effect of water. Experimental The hydrocarbons used were purified by methods usual for liquid-phase oxidations [ 4 ] . The doubly distilled liquids were dried over activated (heating at 620 K for 5 h) Linde 3A zeolite (effective agitation for 24 h) and then stored above zeolite. Immediately before use, the liquid was filtered on a Whatman 1PS silicone-treated phase separator in a dry-box to remove the zeolite particles which are a potential heterogeneous catalyst. A thermostattable, 35 ml glass reaction vessel with temperature control, fitted with a reflux condenser via ground-glass joints was used. The condenser was cooled with water at 283 K. The condenser was attached to an automatic syringe type gas burette (a modified Metrohm Dosimat E415P) with temperature control. For each experiment, 10.00 ml hydrocarbon was used, which contained some t-butyl hydroperoxide as initiator. Before starting, water was added via an appropriate precision syringe and the reaction mixture was saturated with dioxygen by bubbling through dry 02 for 10 min. The reactor was then heated up to 343 K and the recording of OZ uptake was started after 3 min, in the dark. The reaction mixture was stirred effectively during the experiment. The 02 uptake us. time curves had the usual autocatalytic shape, with different time lags; the slope of the longest rising portion of the curve was taken as the initial rate of oxidation. After a conversion time of 2 h, the Oat content of the reaction mixture was analysed iodometrically; in the case of cyclohexene, the epoxide, -one and -of contents were estimated by gas chromatography on a column (2 m X 4 mm i.d.) filled with Chromosorb W-AW-DMCS coated with Carbowax 20 M; carrier gas: N2 at 30-40 ml min-1; detector: FID. Results Figures 1-4 show the initial rate of oxidation as a function of water concentration. These data reveal that cyclohexene, methylcyclohexane, tetralin and cumene are not oxidized in 120 min in the absence of water at 343 K and atmospheric pressure, but oxidation begins when water is added. The rate of oxidation decreases when the saturation concentration of water in the given medium is surpassed and water appears as a separate phase (see Table 1). In L.J. Csanyi et al./J Mol.

On increase of the hydroperoxide concentration, [ H20 ] raax first decreases, but then increases (see Table 2) . (iv) Ordinary water and heavy water behave similarly. Both water species effect the same rate enhancement, and the oxidation is slowed down or stopped when either is present in excess. The rate of water-catalysed oxidation of the hydrocarbons can be influenced by using surfactants in the reaction mixtures. Thus, in the presence of anionic surfactants, such as calcium stearate or Aerosol OT (sodium-bis2 (ethylhexyl)sulphosuccinate), the oxidation is slower than in their absence. Non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100 also result in a rate reduction, whereas, cationic surfactants enhance the rate of oxidation, even in the absence of water (see Table 3) . If the concentration of onium salt in the reaction mixture is increased, the rate of oxidation first increases then reaches a limiting value, or slowly de- 358 L.J. Csanyi et al./J Mol.

The concentration ratio [onium salt]/ [hydroperoxide ] at the breakpoint has individual values of 0.21, 0.63, 0.41 and 0.42 for Aliquat 336 (methy1tricaprylammonium chloride), tetrahexylammonium chloride, cetyltributylammonium chloride and bromide, respectively. It should be emphasized that the rate-enhancing effect of water is unaltered when the reaction mixture also contains surfactant. The overall rate against water concentration curves again give maximum curves. The catalytic effects of the onium salts depend on the nature of their anions (see Figs. 5-7) . The activity sequences are individual: for (Me) 4N-X: Cl > I > Br; for (Bu) 4N-X: I > Br > N03 > SCN = C104 > Cl; for hexadecyltributylphosphonium-X: Cl > Br > F= OH; and for Aliquat 336: Cl > F. Discussion To explain the experimental observations we set out from the point that the rate-influencing effect of water is due to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions of water with the initiating hydroperoxide molecule and with radicals involved in the chain oxidation of the given hydrocarbon [ 5 ] . Unfortunately, little is known concerning the forms of water dissolved in the non-polar organic solvents. Some information can be obtained from the fact that the solubility of water in aromatic solvents is about four times higher at 70 C than at room temperature. In contrast, the temperature coefficient is negative for non-aromatics. This points to a strong interaction between water and aromatic molecules, which probably promotes the breakdown of large water clusters to give more active discrete water molecules and smaller water associations. These participate in activating the hydroperoxide O-O bond through hydrogen bond formation with the protons of water, thereby promoting the formation of free radicals. It is known from the work of Walling and Heaton [ 6 ] that the OH stretching frequency band of a dilute solution of t-butyl hydroperoxide in CC14 is shifted significantly to lower frequencies at higher concentrations and in aromatic solvents. This phenomenon is generally associated with the formation of hydrogen bonds. The formation constant in CC14 was determined to be 0.6 1 mol-1 at 70 C and 1.91 mol-1 at 30 C. This rather strong association by two hydrogen bonds to a cyclic dimer counteracts the formation of other associations of hydroperoxide, which releases radicals into the reaction mixture more easily. On the addition of benzene or other aromatics to t-butyl hydroperoxide in CC14, the 3554 cm-1 band (assigned to the monomeric form of the hydroperoxide) starts to disappear and is replaced by a broader and more intense peak at 3509 cm-1; the shift is due to a hydrogen-bonded complex between the hydroperoxide and the aromatic molecule acting as base. The association constant is 0.111 mol-1 for benzene and 0.11 mol-1 for chlorobenzene at 70 C. In L.J. Csanyi et al./J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 353-364 361 non-aromatic solvents (e.g. methylcyclohegane), there is no such interaction between the hydroperogide and the solvent molecule. In such a medium, therefore, there is no counterbalancing process to hinder formation of the cyclic dimer. Accordingly, the radical production and hence the overall rate of oxidation of hydrocarbon present is reduced. To return now to the question of water catalysis, it can be stated that in the presence of a few monomeric or slightly aggregated water molecules part of the hydroperogide present will be activated by hydrogen bond formation. However, a further increase of the water concentration induces a moderating mechanism: the higher number of water molecules permits them to associate with each other, to form water adducts which continuously lose their effectiveness for O-O bond activation and the oxidation rate decreases. When water is present in excess, the rate of reaction drops to a low value or even zero. It should not be forgotten, however, that radicals (ROZ, RO, etc.) involved in the chain oxidation are similarly exposed to the effect of water. These interactions result in changes in the rates of propagation and termination steps. The overall rate of oxidation is known to be directly proportional to kpropag and indirectly proportional to the square root of kern,;n. Consequently, the hydrogen bond interactions between radicals and water molecules result in only a moderate change in the overall rate of oxidation [ 5 ] . It has been mentioned that the value of [H20 ] n,gg depends on the concentration of hydroperogide applied. At low initiator concentration, a higher concentration of water is required to reach the maximum rate of oxidation. This can be attained at a lower water concentration if an ample radical source is provided. A further increase in the hydroperogide concentration results in a shift of [H20 ] max to higher water concentrations, and in a decreased overall rate of oxidation, because of the competing formation of the kinetically less active cyclic hydroperogide dimer. Many efforts have been made to support the assumption that enhancement of the autogidation rate is due to the activation of hydroperogide by water via hydrogen bonding interactions. To this end, the IR spectra of a series of samples were taken in which t-butyl hydroperogide was dissolved either in the thoroughly dried autogidant as solvent, or in solvent previously saturated with water at room temperature. The spectra showed only slight differences at the 3550 cm-1 shoulder, however, and the absorbances differed from each other slightly in the more interesting spectral range 3450-3300 cm-1. The spectra were rather noisy here and therefore they could not be evaluated reliably even with deconvolution. This means that at such a low concentration of water (<_ 0.03 M) the interaction cannot be detected by the IR method. It should be borne in mind that water catalysis was observed at 70 C, where water was present in a four-fold higher concentration, but an apparatus which could operate at higher temperature was not available. To overcome the difficulties caused by the low solubility of water in the organic solvents, surfactant was added to the reaction mixture to increase the 362 L.J. Csanyi et al./J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 353-364 water concentration at room temperature. Aerosol OT is one of the most effective surfactants for the solubilization of water in a non-polar solvent. In the presence of 0.01 M Aerosol OT, a perfectly homogeneous dilute aqueous tetralin solution was obtained, but the rate of hydrocarbon oxidation dropped to a low value. This was also observed when sodium stearate anionic surfactant was used. In our opinion, the microemulsion thus formed contains water in small droplets surrounded by the surfactant anions, which hamper access to the hydroperoxide molecules to be activated. The size of the water droplets (the aggregation number of surfactant and water) is determined by the molar ratio of [ H20 ] / [Aerosol OT]. This is the reason why the usual maximumtype oxidation rate against water concentration curve could be obtained only when the above concentration ratio was kept constant ( = 6.96, Fig. 3) . Similar rate depression was observed when the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 was applied. In contrast, the application of cationic surfactants results in a considerable increase in the rate of oxidation, both in the presence and in the absence of water. The phenomenon was observed by Ohkubo et al. [ 7-12 ] in a dry medium and it was first explained by activation of the 02 molecule through interaction with the d orbitals of the onium ions. A few years later, this explanation was rejected by van Tilborg [ 13 ] , who pointed out that the red-shift of the absorption maximum upon addition of 02 to an alcoholic solution of onium salt is due to an artifact: an earlier solvent cut-off. On the basis of serial experimental evidence, van Tilborg advanced the view that the onium salt reacts with the hydroperoxide present and some sort of perester is formed, which undergoes homolysis and generates chain-carrying radicals. However, it escaped the attention of van Tilborg that Ohkubo et al. [9] had written \" ....the only reasonable path is the third one (reaction (3)) H ROOH+(C6Hs)3SC1-.[R--O.\"O.~+S(C6H5)3...C1-] ->RO*+,OH+.(C6H5)3SC1 (3)\" Nevertheless, it should be added, the idea of 02 activation, Cat .02, is mentioned unaltered ( [ 9 ] , Fig. 6) . As concerns the composition of the onium salt complex, Napadensky and Sasson [ 14 ] have a rather different view. They assume that the hydroperoxide molecule is attacked by the anion of the quaternary ammonium salt. This can be accepted formally and when the anion is sufficiently electronegative. In other cases, the energy of the H . . X- interaction would be so low that the -O . . . O- bond could not be activated at all. It should be emphasized that water catalysis and onium salt catalysis coexist: the subsequent addition of either catalyst results in the same acceleration of oxidation. This is why mutual activation is assumed. In our opinion, the more nucleophilic oxygen atom (the inner one) of the hydroperoxide is attacked by the onium ion and the outer L.J Csanyi et al./J Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 353-364 363 oxygen atom interacts with one of the protons of a water molecule. It cannot be excluded that another hydrogen bond is formed between the hydrogen atom of the hydroperogide and the oxygen atom of this water molecule. This mutual interaction results in an enhancement of the rate of oxidation, as shown below: x- H 0 0' 1 - t H~ H In accord with the earlier observations, the anions of the onium salts play a decisive role in the efficiency of the catalyst. The activity sequence of the anions, however, is not the same for the different onium salts. In our experience, phosphonium salts always result in greater activation than that for ammonium derivatives. The differences in catalytic efficiency of the differently substituted ammonium salts were found to be slight (Table 3 ). However, this behaviour does not permit the conclusion from ref. 14: \"...that the ammonium cation has no active role in the transition state of reaction (2)\" (i.e., the reaction between hydroperogide and onium ion). It is reasonable to assume that the catalytic activity of the onium salt is closely connected with the ionic character of the given salt and that the ionicity of the salt depends on the nature of the anion. To check this, the conductivities of the investigated onium salts were determined in 0.01 M solution in acetonitrile. For the tetrabutylammonium salts, the following data were obtained: Anion C104 SCN I Br Cl Conductivity (mS) 2.28 2.10 2.08 2.06 i.e., no significant differences in conductivity were found. In contrast, the catalytic activities of these salts (based on the initial rate of oxidation of tetralin ) were as the follows: (16.68, Br 5.17, N03 4.27, SCN 2.97, C104 2.47, C1 0.18) X 10-51 mol-1 s-1 These data show that the effectivity of the onium catalyst does not change in parallel with the electric conductivity: as the rate drops 37-fold from I to Cl, the decrease in conductivity is only 10%. The efficiency sequences of the anions for the different onium salts do not reveal in general that the hard or soft character of the anion is the unique determining factor, as was stated previously [14]. In regard to the selectivity of the water and oniumsalt catalysis, it can be 364 L.J Csdnyi et al./J. Mol. Catal. 80 (1993) 353-364 stated that in the presence of water the main product is the hydroperoxide, but it is also true that the conversion is low. The onium catalysts are generally more active, but the selectivity decreases at higher conversion. In the case of cyclohexene, some epoxide formation was also observed. It should be noted that polar substances may exert a water-dragging effect [ 15 ], i.e., all polar solutes to some extent promote transfer of the water molecules associated with them into the organic solvent. This results in changes in both the concentration and the activity of the water in the organic phase, and thereby in the rate of oxidation. References 1 H.B. Dixon, Chem News, 46 (1882) 151. 2 B.

The liquid-phase oxidations of tetralin, cumene, cyclohexene and methylcyclohexane were investigated in the presence of water and different types of surfactants. It was found that water first increases, then decreases, the rate of oxidation. Aromatic compounds are oxidised more readily than non-aromatic ones. [H2O]max is mostly determined by the concentration of hydroperoxide present, and it does not depend on the nature of the hydrocarbon. H2O and D2O have similar catalytic effects; both inhibit the oxidation when applied in a larger excess. Anionic and non-ionic surfactants reduce the catalytic effect of water, because access to the hydroperoxide molecules by the water droplets is considerably hindered by the surrounding surfactant ions or molecules. In contrast, cationic surfactants catalyse the oxidation, their efficiencies largely depend on the nature of their anions. It is assumed that the water catalysis arises from the H-bonding interaction of the hydroperoxide with the discrete or less-associated water molecules. Water and onium ion have a joint catalytic effect. The onium-ion pair attacks at the more nucleophilic O-atom of the hydroperoxide, while the outer O-atom is activated by water, through Hbond formation.
