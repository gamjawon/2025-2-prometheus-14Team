Tel.: +86 22 23502996; fax: +86 22 23502669. Palladium-modified TiO2 nanofibers (Pd/TiO2NFs) were prepared from PdCl2 and titanate nanotubes by a photodecomposition method. The samples were characterized with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV–Vis spectra. The morphology of the nanotubes was destroyed during the illumination process due to the high activity of titanate nanotubes and the existence of Pd/TiO2 batteries. The photocatalytic activity of the samples for degradation of methyl orange solution was also studied, and high photocatalytic activity was observed. When palladium content was 1.5wt.%, Pd/TiO2NFs showed the highest activity. Keywords Palladium Modified TiO2 nanofibers Photocatalytic activity Methyl orange 1 Introduction Titanium dioxide has been widely used as photocatalyst, gas sensor, white pigment in paints, and optical coating. It is also used in solar cells for the production of hydrogen and electric energy, in ceramics, and in electric devices [1]. By far, the applied research on TiO2 for photo-degradation of organic pollutions is among the most pursued one [1]. However, the TiO2 photocatalyst has two limitations for practical applications. One is that the TiO2 has activity only under the light with wavelength shorter than 388nm because of its wide band gap (E g =3.2eV), which limits the use of sunlight as an excitation energy. Another one is that the high recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs in TiO2 results in low photo quantum efficiency [2–4]. To overcome these two difficulties, many efforts have been made to modify TiO2 or explore new TiO2-based systems [4–6]. One of promising approaches is based on the metal loading. Various metals, such as Pt, Au and Pd, have been used as electron acceptors to separate the photo-induced hole/electron pair and promote interfacial charge-transfer processes [7]. It has long been recognized that the metal particles in a finely divided form should be of great benefit to the system’s catalytic activity [8]. To get metal particles with high dispersion and high activity, it is believed that tubular TiO2 is a better support than TiO2 powder [9]. Furthermore, the nanotube also has high sedimentation rate, which could facilitate its separation from the slurry-type reactors and the reutilization of catalyst [5,10]. In 1998, Kasuga developed a simple hydrothermal method to turn TiO2 particles into tubular structure [11]. Since then, the practical application of using the TiO2 nanotubes is of a possibility [5,12,13]. A lot of works on tubular TiO2 and modification of tubular TiO2 photocatalysts have been reported [5,14,15]. However, the palladium-modified tubular TiO2 photocatalyst has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, TiO2 particles were fabricated into tubular structure by hydrothermal method, and then modified with palladium particles after a photodecomposition process. The photocatalytic activity of the resulting catalysts was also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of samples All of the chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. Raw TiO2 powder was pure anatase crystal. Titanate nanotubes were synthesized by using raw TiO2 powder as precursor according to the reported procedure [13]. The obtained white nanotubes were first dispersed in the admixture of water and ethanol (1g TiO2 nanotubes/50mL H2O+50mL ethanol) by ultrasonic treatment, and then appropriate amounts of PdCl2 solution (0.166mg/mL) was added. Then the suspension was irradiated for 3h by using a 300W High-Pressure Mercury Lamp at a distance of 10cm under stirring at ambient temperature. The wavelength of the irradiation source was in the range of 200–1000nm, and no cut-off filter was used. The obtained Pd/TiO2NFs were washed with water to remove Cl− ions and dried at 80°C in air. The palladium contents, which were calculated by the used amounts of titanate nanotubes and PdCl2 in the experiment, were 0.5wt.%, 1wt.%, 1.5wt.%, and 2wt.%, respectively. 2.2 Characterization of samples The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out at room temperature using a Rigaku D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα λ =0.154nm) to identify crystal phase of the products. TEM images were obtained with a Philips T20ST transmission electron microscopy working at 200kV. Diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectra of the samples (powder disk) were obtained with a JASCO V-570 spectrometer at room temperature. 2.3 Catalytic activity The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was evaluated by the degradation rates of methyl orange in water under UV–Vis light irradiation. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 50mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 100mL of methyl orange solution (13mg/L). Then the system was illuminated with the same light source used in preparation of samples under the same condition. The concentration of methyl orange solution was monitored by measuring the absorption at 463.5nm using a TU-1901 spectrometer. The results were calibrated with the decomposition of the dye in the absence of catalysts and adsorption of dye on the catalyst. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructural characterization of the samples XRD analyses are carried out to identify the crystal phase of the samples. The XRD patterns of titanate nanotubes and Pd/TiO2NFs with different palladium content are shown in Fig. 1 . When TiO2 nanotubes is photoexcited by UV light, holes (h+) and electrons (e−) are produced [6]. The electrons can be captured by Pd2+ ions that adhere to the nanotubes, and PdCl2 becomes metal Pd as a result. The scheme is as follows: TiO 2 + hv → TiO 2 + e - + h + Pd 2 + + 2 e - → Pd 0 After the photodecomposition process, the crystal phase of the support changes, which is similar to the situation reported for gold-loaded titanate nanotubes [14]. The as-prepared nanotubes are mainly composed of titanate phase H2Ti2O5 ·H2O (JCPDS 47-0124), which is shown by the appearance of the peaks at 2θ =9.2° and 24°. They correspond well to (200) and (110) reflections of H2Ti2O5 ·H2O, respectively. Compared with the pure nanotubes, no obvious titanate peak is observed in Pd/TiO2NFs, and titanate should have turned into anatase TiO2. It has been reported that the nanotube structure is influenced by the crystal phase [16]. So the structure of nanotubes in Pd/TiO2NFs should have been altered. The presence of a new peak at 2θ =40° as seen in curves d and e corresponds well to (111) diffraction of palladium (JCPDS 5-0683). It means that palladium particles are deposited on the support. However, no obvious palladium peak is found in curves b and c. This should be attributed to the high dispersion of the palladium particles and the low palladium content. A deep insight into the system nanostructure can be obtained by TEM observations. Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HR-TEM images of Pd/TiO2NFs with 1wt.% palladium. Compared with the titanate nanotubes’ tubular structure of high quality [5], the structure of the tubular support in Pd/TiO2NFs has changed greatly after the illumination process. Though a few nanotubes can be observed in Fig. 2D, their length is relatively shorter, and many lamellar particles supported on linear bundles can be observed (Fig. 2A and B). At high magnification (Fig. 2C), fringe periodicity of the particle is measured to be 0.35nm, consistent well with the lattice spacing between {101} planes of anatase TiO2. The titanate nanotubes are broken during the illumination process, which is in accord with the XRD results. It is also similar to the formation process of gold-loaded TiO2 nanofibers [14]. As has been discussed in our previous work [14], the formation of small batteries (Pd/TiO2), and consequential photodecomposition of H2O on the TiO2 and Pd electrodes may be the main reason that induce the alteration of the nanotubes. The black particles (marked with arrow) are identified to be palladium. During the photodecomposition process, the formation of palladium particles occurs with the alteration of the titanate nanotubular structure and formation of anatase phase. This process can also prevent the formed palladium particles from agglomeration. Consequently, small palladium particles form, and are difficult to be detected by XRD analysis at low palladium content. After palladium is loaded, the color of titanate nanotube changes from white to grey, and the grey to dark with the increasing of palladium content. To express the optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts, diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectra are measured. Fig. 3 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of pure nanotubes and Pd/TiO2NFs with 1wt.% palladium. It can be observed that the optical absorption enhanced significantly in the region of 400–800nm after palladium is loaded, corresponding to the grey color of Pd/TiO2NFs. It is obvious that the presence of palladium caused noticeable absorption in visible region, which suggested that the photocatalytic activity in the visible region could be possible [4]. Photocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by measuring their activities for degradation of methyl orange in aqueous solution. Fig. 4 shows the photocatalytic activity of Pd/TiO2NFs with various palladium contents and the activity is revealed by the percent of residual methyl orange at different irradiation time. It is obvious that the palladium particles have strong influence on the photoactivity of TiO2 support, and the catalytic performance of TiO2 support is enhanced after palladium is loaded. It has been generally accepted that metal particles can act as electron acceptor in the metal-TiO2 photocatalytic system [4,17]. As has been reported, the photocatalytic reaction rate of prime TiO2 is not high enough owing to a quick recombination of charge carriers [18]. After metal (palladium) is loaded, the recombination of electron-hole pair recombination may be minimized due to the capture of electrons by palladium [4,19]. As a result, higher catalytic activity may be expected after palladium particles are loaded. However, the photocatalytic activity of Pd/TiO2NFs increases with the increasing of palladium concentration only when the palladium concentration is between 0.5wt.% and 1.5wt.%. When palladium concentration is 1.5wt.%, 85% of the methyl orange is degraded after 90min irradiation, and the activity is the highest. A further increase in palladium content reduces the photocatalytic activity. When the palladium content is 2wt.%, the Pd/TiO2NFs’ activity is even lower than that of Pd/TiO2NFs with 0.5wt.% palladium. The optimum concentration of palladium loading at 1.5wt.% may be due to the most efficient separation of photo-induced hole/electron pairs at this loading content. Based on literature reports [20] and our experiment results, a mechanism is proposed for the degradation of pollutants on Pd/TiO2 under UV light irradiation as follows: (1) TiO 2 (hv) → TiO 2 ( e - + h + ) (2) H 2 O = H + + OH - (3) OH - + h + → OH (4) e - + Pd → Pd ( e - ) (5) OH + O 2 + methyl orange → degradation products In this photo-degradation process, reaction (5) should play a key role. Because oxygen is not supplied in this reaction, [O2] can be taken as constant only during the initial period under illumination [21]. At the beginning of the photoreaction process (0–90min), [ OH] and [O2] can be taken as constant, and the photooxidation rate is determined by the concentration of methyl orange. The inset curves in Fig. 4 are the corresponding ln(C 0/C) vs. t plots at 0–90min irradiation time, which indicates that the photooxidation follows first-order kinetics. Its kinetics can be expressed as follows: ln(C 0/C)= kt, where k is the apparent reaction rate constant, C 0 and C are the initial concentration and the reaction concentration of methyl orange, respectively. Table 1 shows the rate constant values (k) of Pd/TiO2NFs catalysts with different palladium content for degradation of methyl orange solution. It can be observed that the k value of 1.5% Pd/TiO2NFs is the largest, and is nearly 3.4 times as fast as that of pure titanate nanotubes, which is in accord with the curves of the catalysts’ photocatalytic activities. 4 Conclusions By using PdCl2 and titanate nanotubes as precursor, Pd/TiO2NFs with different palladium content were prepared by a photodecomposition method. The nanotubular structure of support was destroyed during the fabrication process. Compared with pure titanate nanotubes, the obtained Pd/TiO2NFs show an obvious absorption in visible region and have higher photocatalytic activities for degradation of methyl orange under UV light irradiation. When palladium content is 1.5wt.%, the TiO2 supported catalyst show the highest photocatalytic activity. Due to the high sedimentation rate of the one-dimensional catalyst, Pd/TiO2NFs can be recycled and expected to be useful in industries.
