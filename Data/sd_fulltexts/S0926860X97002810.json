The effect of temperature. CO/H2 ratio, space velocity and oxygenates, and water addition to the teed stream has been studied in order to maximize the short-chain alcohols productivity. It has been found that: (i) the reaction temperature is a key-parameter to control the alcohol productivity, and temperatures in the range 560--585 K are adequate for obtaining high pr~xluction of C2-C3 alcohols. Also, in this temperature range the formation of undesired side-products (hydrocarbons) is minimized, (ii) the gradual enrichment of hydrogen in the reactant mixture (in the range H2/CO = 0.8-1.65) causes a progressive increase in the formation of methanol and a decrease in the amounts of C2. oxygenates. (iii) the product distribution is rather unaffected by space velocity in the range 9040-15300 Ncc/(h g,,t). (iv) the addition of methanol to the CO/H~ feed stream does not leads to significant variations in the product distribution, (v) the addition of ethanol to the feed stream significantly increases the overall C2+ oxygenate productivity, (vi) the results obtained upon ester injection to the CO/H, feed stream are parallel to those obtained upon injection of the corresponding alcohols, i.e. methyl formate and methyl acetate behave as methanol and ethanol, respectively, (vii) water addition does not significantly affect the methanol synthesis reaction, whereas exerts a dramatic inhibitory effect on the formation of the C,. linear and branched alcohols. The observed effect of the operating conditions on the HAS have been discussed in the light of the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the synthesis. ( 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The principal products of the HAS are a complex mixture of oxygenate compounds, among which methanol and isobutanol (2-methyl- l-propanol) predominate. The coupling of these two alcohols via a two-step process has been proposed for the synthesis of MTBE (methyl-ten- 394 L. Mtqocchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 393-405 butyl ether) [3-61, whose production is rapidly grow- ing now-a-days. Both alkali doped low-temperature Cu-based [7-11] and high-temperature ZnCrO-based 112-141 catalysts have been proposed for the HAS. Besides modified Fischer-Tropsch [ 15-17], Group Vill Metal- based catalysts [18] and modified Mo-catalysts 1191 have been studied. Cu-based catalysts are characterized by high pro- ductivity to methanol and C2-C3 alcohols (ethanol and l-propanol) 17], whereas high-temperature modified ZnCr oxide catalysts exhibit higher selectivity to isobutanol 114]. Beretta et al. [20] recently proposed a new inter- esting process based on an alternative engineering design that couples the high C2-C3 alcohols produc- tivity of the Cu-based catalysts with the high isobu- tanol selectivity of the alkali-doped ZnCrO systems. This process consists of two consecutive steps: the first one uses a Cu-based catalyst which promotcs the Ibrmation of short-chain alcohols, whereas the second one uses a high-temperature catalyst that converts these C2-C3 intermediate species into 2-methyl- branched alcohols. A significant incrcase in the yields of isobutanol has been obtained with the double-bed configuration if compared to the traditional single- stage processes. In view of the potential interest in thc double-bed configuration, an investigation has been undertaken in our labs with the aim to optimize the performance of the first low-temperature bed, i.e. to increase the short- chain alcohol production (ethanol and l-propanol), that are intermediates in the formation of 2-methyl- branched species. A Cs-promoted Cu/ZnO/Cr20~ catalyst with composition similar to that already employed by Nunan et al. 17-9.211 and by Beretta et al. [201 has been used fl)r this purposc, and thc effect of the reaction temperature, H2/CO ratio and contact time on the productivity of C2-C3 alcohols has been investigated. Then, chemical enrichment experiments wcre also performed to study the effect of oxygenates addition to the CO 4- H2 feed stream. The most abundant C~-C2 species obtained in the product mixture were chosen as probe molecules to be injected in the teed stream: alcohols (methanol and ethanol) and two esters (methyl formate and methyl acetate) have been selected for this purpose. In particular methanol was selected to investigate its role as precursor of the reactive C~ species inw~lved in the first carbon- carbon bond formation (Ci ~ C2 step), whereas etha- nol injection was performed to investigate its role in the chain-growth mechanism to higher (C2.) oxyge- nates. Finally, the effect of water addition to the teed stream was also investigated to verity its inhibitory effect on the formation of oxygenates. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The 3% mol Cs-promoted Cu/ZnO/Cr20.~ catalyst (Cu/Zn/Cr = 30/45/25) used in this study was synthe- sized fi)llowing the procedure reported in the literature 17-9,21]. Briefly, a hydrotalcite-like precursor Cu2.4Zn~,6Cr(OH)t6CO3-4H20 has been obtained by coprecipitation with Na2CO3 from a 1 M Cu-Zn-Cr nitrate solution, using a Turbine agitator and main- raining the pH .= 9 and the temperature at about 323- 333 K [22,231. The precipitate was filtered, thor- oughly washed with hot distilled water and dried at room temperature; then the obtained precursor was crushed, sieved to 100-115 mesh and calcined in air at 623 K for 3 h with temperature step-wise increment of 100 K/h. The catalyst was then wet-impregnated with 3% mol of Cs by using a solution of Cs__CO:~ + HCOOH under a N2 stream, dried at 373 K overnight and finally calcinated at 623 K for 3 h. Befbre the catalytic activity tests, the catalyst was activated in the synthesis reactor at 523 K and atmo- spheric pressure for 6 h under a reducing H2/N2 mixture (H2 = 5% v/v) 2.2. Apparatus for catalytic activity runs High purity H2/Ar (Ar = internal standard) and CO streams were delivered from cylinders and mixed upstream from the reactor inlet. The CO line was equipped with a purifying gas zone: an activated charcoal trap to eliminate traces of organic com- pounds and a K-doped \";,-AI203 trap maintained at 523 K in order to decompose iron carbonyls [24], which cause irreversible catalyst deactivation 125l. I.. Majocchi et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 11998) 393-405 395 A further line for N2 was also set to be used for catalyst activation. The feed gases flow rates were measured and con- trolled by means of electronic mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850 E). The feed section included also a high-pressure liquid pump (Gilson) for liquid injec- tion. An internally copper-lined stainless steel fixed- bed reactor operating at 7.5 MPa was used for cata- lytic activity tests. The reactor was placed into an electric furnace equipped with a three-zones electric heater that were driven by three proportional- integral-derivative (PID) electronic temperature con- troller. 1.5 g of catalyst diluted with 2.5 ml of glass beads (210-3(X) p,m) up to a total volume of 5 ml was used for catalytic activity tests. The catalyst was held in the center of the reactor tube (8 mm i.d. and 50 cm long) by means of glass beads and quartz wool plugs. The temperature of the catalytic bed was monitored with a K-type thermocouplc sliding inside a copper-lined thermocouple. The system pressure was maintained at 7.5 MPa by means of a 'Back Pressure Regulator' placed in a thermostat container. The productivity of the reaction products was cal- culated by condensing the reactor effluent in high- pressure traps maintained at 273 K, followed by capil- lary GC analysis of the collected liquid samples. Non- condensable species were analyzed by on-line GC by using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph and an Hew- lett-Packard 5985 B gas chromatograph connected in a parallel mode. A molecular sieves column connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to separate Ar, CO and CO2 (Argon was adopted as internal standard to quantify the product distribution), whereas a Poraplot Q capillary columns connected to a TCD was used to analyzed CO2, hydrocarbons, H_.20 and other non-condensed products. The liquid product mixture analyses were per- formed alter 5-6 h of collection in steady-state, The liquid was analyzed by using a SE54 capillary column connected to a flame ionization detector (FID), The identification of the various products was based on comparison of the retention times with those of known standards, n-propyl acetate was used in this case as internal standard to quantify the liquid product dis- tribution. The TCD and FID response factors of the major reaction products were obtained by analysis of liquid and gaseous standard mixtures. Carbon balances were calculated in each experiments by comparing the overall amount of carbon detected in the outlet product mixture with the direct measure of the converted CO. Carbon balances always closed within 100 _+_ 10%. 3. Results and discu~ion 3.1. Reference experiments Preliminary catalytic activity experiments have been performed with the same operating conditions given in the literature 17-9,20,21], i.e. 7= 583 K: P =-- 7.5 MPa; H2/CO = 0.45 and gas hour space velo- city (GHSV) = 5780 Ncc/(h goat). These experiments have been performed in order to check the catalytic activity of the sample prepared in our labs with respect to that reported in the literature 17-9,20,211. The product distribution observed in these condi- tions over the Cs-doped Cu/ZnO/Cr203 catalyst includes CI~6 linear primary alcohols, C4-C7 two- branched primary alcohols, C3--C7 secondary alcohols and the corresponding carbonyl species (aldehydes and ketones), methyl esters, traces of dimethyl and dietbyl ether and C~-Ca hydrocarbons, Higher mole- cular weight products were also formed in small quantities. No additional products (i.e. acids) have been observed in significant amount. The productiv- ities of these products were in close agreement with those reported in the literature under the same operat- ing conditions [7-9,21]. This proved a good reprodu- cibility of the catalyst preparation and the adequacy of the procedure for catalytic activity tests. Thereby new sets of experiments were performed by varying the temperature, the H2/CO ratio, the contact time and by adding C~-C2 oxygenates and water to the feed stream, as previously reported. 3.2. Effect of reaction wmperature The effect of the reaction temperature on the for- mation of the different reaction products has been investigated in the range 523-598 K with CO/ H2 = 0.8 and P--7.5 MPa. The maximum investi- gated temperature was limited to 598 K in order to 396 L.

The lowest reaction temperature (523 K) corresponds to the tem- perature threshold for the formation of C2oxyge- nates. The changes observed in the overall product dis- tribution upon increasing the reaction temperature in the range 523-598 K are shown in Fig. 1 (a-d). At the lowest investigated temperature (523 K), methanol accounts for almost the overall liquid productivity. Only minor amounts of ethanol and methyl formate are formed, along with C02 (not reported in the figure) that always accompanies the formation of higher oxygenates via the water-gas shift reaction (WGS) 126]. On increasing the reaction temperature, the forma- tion of additional reaction products is observed. These include CI--C4 linear primary alcohols (Fig. la), C4-C6 branched alcohols (Fig. lb), esters (methyl formate, methyl acetate, methyl propionate and methyl isobutyrate, Fig. lc), methane and ethane (Fig. ld). The formation of minor amounts of C4~, ketones (not reported in the figures) is also observed. CO2 formation significantly increases on increasing the reaction temperature, The rates of formation of the various reaction products show different dependencies from tempera- ture. Methanol and C2. linear alcohols show maxima on increasing the reaction temperature, the formation of branched alcohols apparently level-off at high temperature and that of methane and C2. hydrocar- bons monotonically increase with temperature. The presence of a maximum in the productivity of methanol is related to both kinetic and thermodynamic reasons. At low temperatures the methanol synthesis reaction is kinetically controlled and the methanol productivity increases with temperature, as expected. L.

Comparison of the equilibrium constant K,,a of the methanol synthesis reaction with the experimental fugacity ratio Kp based on measured reactor exit composition. ( ): theoretical equilibrium constant K~q : (O): experimental equili- brium constant Kp. On increasing the reaction temperature, the methanol synthesis reaction approaches chemical equilibrium and accordingly the methanol concentration decreases with temperature, being an exothermic reaction. This has been proved by a thermodynamic analysis show- ing that the methanol synthesis reaction approaches thermodynamic equilibrium at the highest investi- gated temperatures. Fig. 2 compares the equilibrium constant Keq [27] of the methanol synthesis reaction with the experimental fugacity ratio Kp: the deviations from chemical equilibrium decrease on increasing the reaction temperature, and chemical equilibrium is approached near 553 K. It is interesting to note that the concentration of the major C2 + primary alcohols (i.e. ethanol, l-propanol and isobutanol) show distinct maxima on increasing the reaction temperature. In particular the concentrations of ethanol, l-propanol and isobutanol apparently shift towards higher tem- peratures on increasing the carbon atom number of the alcohol molecule. The formation of such species is not limited by thermodynamic constraints, and the observed behavior is possibly related to kinetic rea- sons. It has been demonstrated by Klier et al. [28,29] that the formation of higher oxygenates in the HAS occurs via a complex chain growth mechanism invol- ving a series of 'Normal' and/or 'Reversal' aldolic- type condensation reactions involving Ct-C, oxyge- nate molecules. Due to the high C~ concentration (the methanol concentration is roughly one order of mag- nitude higher than the concentration of the other alcohols), it is likely that the C,, - C~ ~ C,, _ ~ pro- cesses dominate over the C,, Cm ~ C, . ,,, steps in the chain growth mechanisms, and accordingly the chemical pathway: C t - OH +c, C2 - OH ~ c~, C3 - OH ~-~' iC4 - OH prevails in the formation of higher oxygenates. Iso- butanol is considered here as a 'terminal' species due to the extremely low reactivity of its precursor (iso- butanal) in the chain growth mechanism [30]. The dominance of the C,, ---, C,, . ~ pathway is demon- strated by the low quantities of species coming from C,, + C,,, condensation steps, e.g. l-butanol (C2 + C,) and C5, oxygenates. On increasing the reaction temperature the C= + C,, pathway is kinetically accelerated and hence the for- mation of isobutanol was favored, with ethanol and l-propanol exhibiting different maxima being inter- mediates in such a reaction scheme. Formation of esters closely resembled that of the corresponding alcohols whereas the productivity of methane and higher hydrocarbons (mainly ethane and propane) is significantly enhanced by the reaction temperature. Methane is possibly formed via the methanation reaction (CO + 3H2 ~ CH4 + H20) whereas the origin of C2+ hydrocarbons may involve dehydration from the corresponding alcohols (with the corresponding alkanes as intermediates) and/or a par- allel Fischer-Tropsch pathway. The significant for- mation of ethane that has been observed upon ethanol injection in the feed stream (see the chemical enrich- ment experiments described below) confirms that the formation of hydrocarbons via alcohol dehydration is effective over the Cu-based catalyst investigated in the present study. The results presented above clearly indicate that the reaction temperature has a strong effect on the product distribution, as shown in Fig. 3(a-b) for the methanol/ higher alcohols ratio (MeOH/HA, Fig. 3a). the aver- age carbon atom number of the C2. oxygenates (No, Fig. 3a) and the carbon selectivity to hydrocarbons, CO2. methanol and higher oxygenates (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3(a) clearly shows that the ratio of methanol/ higher alcohols in the liquid product significantly decreases by one order of magnitude with temperature 398 L.

Also, the average carbon atom num- ber in the oxygenates increases with temperature (No ~ 2 at 523 K and ~3.5 at 598 K) due to beneficial effect of the reaction temperature on the chain growth mechanism to higher oxygenates. This is also reflected by the increase in the carbon selectivity to C2~ oxygenates (Fig. 3b) that is however always accom- panied by an increase in the CO2 selectivity. The C- selectivity towards methane and higher hydrocarbons is not significantly affected by the reaction tempera- ture. 3.3. Effect of feed composition A series of catalytic activity tests were performed to investigate the effect of the H2/CO ratio on the short chain alcohol production. The H2/CO ratio was varied in the range 0.81-1.65, these values being typical of the syngas produced by steam reforming of methane [31]. A temperature of 568 K has been selected due to the high productivity of C2-C:~ alcohols observed in these conditions (see above). Also, at this temperature the catalyst did not present any significant deactivation over the investigated span of time (> 100 h), in line with literature indications [321. The effects observed on the product distribution upon changing the HffCO ratio in the range 0.81-1.65 are showed in Fig. 4(a-d), that reports the percent mole fractions of the principal reaction products obtained with H2/CO = 0.8, 1.1 and 1.65. In the case of the alcohol molecules, Fig. 4(a) clearly shows that the gradual enrichment of hydrogen in the reactant mixture causes a progressive increase in the formation of methanol and a decrease in the amounts of both linear and branched alcohols. As a result, the metha- nol/higher alcohol ratio in the product mixture is significantly increased, as shown in Fig. 5. Also. the average carbon atom number of the C2+ oxyge- nates slightly decreases on increasing the H2/CO ratio (empty circles in Fig. 5). The formation of methyl formate is not significantly affected by the increase of the H2/CO ratio whereas the percent mole fraction of the higher esters present in the product mixture closely resembles that of the corres- ponding alcohols. Finally, the rate of formation of me- thane and higher paraffins (ethane) is rather unaffected by the feed composition in the investigated range. The observed behavior is in line with the expected effect of H2 on the chain growth processes to higher oxygenates. Aldehyde molecules are the reactive intermediate species in the aldolic-type chain growth mechanism [33]. Accordingly it is expected that an increase in the hydrogen partial pressure will favor the hydrogenation of the aldehydic intermediates to the corresponding alcohols, thus inhibiting the chain growth processes to higher oxygenates. The figure previously cited clearly shows that the methanol/ higher alcohols ratio is greatly increased by increasing the H2/CO ratio whereas the average carbon atom number of the C2+ oxygenates is not significantly affected. It is speculated that the formation of higher oxygenates is primarily inhibited by the increase in the H2 partial pressure due to the enhanced conversion of the CI reactive surface species to methanol [28.29], L.

The present data is well compared with those reported by Beretta et al. [20] obtained under similar experimental condition with a Cu-based catalyst hav- ing the same composition. 3.4. Effect of gas hour .wace velocity (GHSV) The effect of contact time was also explored by varying GHSV in the range 9040-15564 Ncc/(h g~t) at T = 568 K and H2/CO -- 1. The product distribu- tion results rather unaffected by the increase of GHSV in the investigated range. The branched/linear ratio slightly decreased. In tact, for the short contact times the C2-C3 production is favored in respect of the higher oxygenates. Also, a very slight decrease of the higher alcohols/methanol ratio can be seen for the same reason previously cited. 3.5. Effi'ct of the addition of ox.vgenates Chemical enrichment experiments were performed by injecting selected oxygenates (methanol, ethanol, methyl formate and methyl acetate) in the CO/H2 gas feed mixture. The purpose of these experiments was twofold: on one side, we wanted to investigate the role of such oxygenates (that represent the major reaction products) in the chain growth mechanism leading to the formation of higher alcohols\" on the other hand, it was of interest to verify a possible improvement in the formation of the desired C2-C~ light alcohols. Water was also added to the CO/H2 feed stream: in this case the inhibiting effect of H20 on the HAS has been addressed. The chemical enrichment experiments have been performed at 7\":-.: 568 K; P = 7.5 MPa: GHSV :- 9000 Ncc/(h g~.;,t) and with HffCO -:- I. 4(X) L.

We note that 13% represents the methanol equilibrium concentration under the investigated operating condi- tions. No significant variations in the product distribu- tion have been observed upon addition of methanol to the feed stream, even at the highest amount (13% mol). This is in line with the thermodynamic constraints affecting the methanol synthesis reaction previously discussed and confirms that the addition of methanol to the feed stream does not produce any appreciable improvement in the lbrmation of higher alcohols, as also observed over modified high-temperature methanol synthesis catalysts [34]. Accordingly, the C,,+CI chemical pathway as previously discussed cannot be driven towards the formation of higher oxygenates by addition of metha- nol in equal amounts or below to those already pro- duced in the synthesis. This is in line with the existence of an equilibrium involving methanol and the adsorbed C] oxygenate species involved in the C,, ---, C,, ~ I step, as already suggested in the case of the high-temperature alkalized ZnCr oxide catalysts [261. 3.5.2. Ethanol addition Two levels of ethanol have been added to the feed gas mixture, namely 0.53 and 0.75 mol%. As shown in Fig. 6(a-d), the addition of ethanol to the feed stream significantly promotes the lbrmation of various reaction products, and particularly of C2, alcohols (ethanol, l-propanol and isobutanol), of methyl acetate and of ethane, that increases by a factor of 3 (from about 0.02 to 0.06 mol%). The general increase in the productivity of the various reaction products clearly indicates that ethanol play a key-role in the chain growth process to higher oxygenates. Being related to the first C2 intermediate species (possibly acetaldehyde) involved in the alco- hol chain growth mechanism, ethanol addition to the feed stream results in a general increase of the pro- ductivity of C2+ oxygenates. As a result, the methanol/ higher oxygenates ratio is decreased from 10 to about 7. It is worth of interest that among the various oxygenates, l-propanol and isobutanol experienced the major increments lbllowing ethanol addition. This is in line with the C,, + Cl chain growth pathway previously discussed involving subsequent addition of C~ oxygenates to the growing C,, intermediate, with isobutanol acting as terminal species due to its low reactivity. Ethanol addition leads to the significant increase in the formation of 1 -propanol (Cj + C2 ---, C3) that is further converted to isobutanol (CI + Cs ---, i-C4). The C,, + Cz rate is faster then the C,, + C,, rate, as pointed out by the limited increase in the l-butanol productivity (C2 + C2 step) if compared to the increase in the formation of l-propanol (Ci ~- C2). This is possibly related to both the abun- dance of the C~ reactive intermediate (methanol con- centration is one order of magnitude higher than that of the other oxygenates) and to the high reactivity of its precursor (tormaldehyde) in aldolic-type conden- sation reactions as well [35]. Among esters, Fig. 6(c) shows that methyl acetate has a significant increase upon ethanol addition whereas methyl formate and methyl propionate exhi- bit only limited increments. Formation of methyl isobutyrate, on the other hand, is not affected to a significant extent. Fig. 6(d) shows the variations observed in the mole fraction of hydrocarbons at the reactor outlet upon increasing the ethanol concentration of the CO/H2 feed mixture. The formation of methane is slightly enhanced at the highest ethanol contents whereas the concentration of ethane is increased by a factor of 3. This indicates that ethanol acts as a precursor in the formation of ethane, presumably via a dehydration L.

The presence of ethylene has indeed been detected in the product mixture although in minor amounts. It is concluded that the dehydration route represents a possible reac- tion pathway leading to the tbrmation of hydrocarbons over the Cs-doped Cu/ZnO/Cr203 catalyst employed in the present study. 3.5.3. Methyl formate and methyl acetate addition Other chemical enrichment experiments were per- formed by adding methyl formate and methyl acetate in the feed stream. These oxygenates have been selected being produced in non-negligible amounts during the HAS over the Cs-doped Cu/ZnO/Cr203 catalyst. Fig. 7 compares the product concentration obtained upon addition of 0.48% mol/moi of methyl-formate and 0.375% mol/mol of methyl-acetate to the feed stream with that measured in the case of a standard catalytic activity test. In the case of methyl formate, the formation of the major oxygenate species is not significantly affected by the ester addition to the feed gas mixture. Only a slight increase in the concentration of methanol has been observed. On the basis of an 'a posteriori\" thermodynamic analysis performed over the reaction mixture, it has been found that the methyl formate concentration is limited by thermodynamics accord- ing to the following stoichiometry: CH3OH -r- CO ~ HCOOCH3 Similar observations have been reported by Tronconi et al. [26] in the case of alkali-doped high-temperature ZnCr oxide catalysts. The ester molecule being in equilibrium with the concentrations of CO and metha- nol, it is expected that the addition of methyl formate to the feed mixture resembles that of methanol pre- viously discussed, as indeed observed. Along similar lines, methyl acetate being in equili- brium with CO and ethanol, the effects produced by methyl acetate injection on the product distribution 402 L.

As a matter of fact, Fig. 7 shows an increase in the productivity of all the C2- species upon methyl acetate addition. A compar- ison with the results reported in Fig. 6 (ethanol addition) indicates that, under a qualitative point of view, methyl acetate exerts on the product distribution the same effects observed in the case of ethanol injection. 3.5.4. Water addition Finally, the effect of water addition to the CO/H2 teed stream was investigated. Water was added to the feed gas mixture in the range 0-7.6 tool% and the obtained results are reported in Fig. 8(a-d) in terms of product distribution as a function of the inlet water content. Due to the occurrence of the WGS reaction the addition of H20 to the CO/H2 feed stream leads to the formation of huge amounts of CO2, (not reported in the figures). As a matter of fact. it has been verified that the WGS reaction approaches thermodynamic equilibrium at the reactor outlet. Fig. 8(a) shows that the methanol formation is not significantly altered upon water addition, whereas a dramatic inhibitory effect of water vapor was evident on the tbrmation of the C2+ linear and branched alcohols. A corresponding decrease in the amount of esters was also observed, along with methane and higher hydrocarbons. The results presented in Fig. 8 clearly indicate that water selectively inhibits the chain growth mechanism to higher oxygenates with respect to the methanol synthesis reaction, for which only minor changes have been observed. This strong inhibiting effect on the fon'nation of C2+ products may be related to the presence of either water or CO2, this last species formed via the WGS reaction. It has been reported that the presence of carbon dioxide in the CO/H2 stream negatively affects the tbrmation of higher oxygenates over high-temperature modified methanol L.

Symbols of Fig. 8(a-d) as in Fig. I(a~.t), respectively. synthesis catalysts [14], but the debate is still open whether H20 or CO2 is the inhibiting reactant in the HAS. On the other hand, it has also been reported that the methanol synthesis reaction is favored by the presence of CO2 in the feed stream [28]. These results are in line with our data showing that water (or carbon dioxide) exerts its inhibiting effects on the chain growth mechanism to higher oxygenates rather than on the methanol synthesis reaction. However, it is not clear from the present data whether the strong inhibiting effect of water is associated to the first C~ ~ C2 step and/or to the following aldolic-type chain growth mechanism to higher oxygenates. As a matter of fact, only a slight decrease in the average carbon atom number of C2+ oxygenates has been observed (from 2.75 to 2.5) thus suggesting a specific inhibiting effect of water on the Cl ~ C2 step. These effects could be explained by assuming that water inhibits the HAS reaction by competing for adsorption with the intermediate Ci-species on the catalyst surface [14]. 4. Conclusions An investigation on the effects of the operating conditions and oxygenates, and water additions on the HAS over a Cs-doped CuZnCr oxide catalyst has been performed in the present study. The effect of temperature, CO/H2 ratio, space velocity and oxyge- nates, and water addition to the feed stream has been investigated, and the following major conclusion have been derived: I. the reaction temperature is a key-parameter to control the short-chain alcohols productivity. Ethanol and propanol concentrations show max- ima in the range 560-585 K, and accordingly this temperature range seems to be the preferential work-window for utilizing the Cu-based catalyst in order to optimize the production of C2-C~ alcohols. Above this temperature level, the production of ethanol and propanol progressively decrease due to their consumption in the for- mation of higher oxygenate. Also, in this tem- 404 1,. Majocchi et al./Applied Catalysi,~\" A.\" General 166 (1998) 393~105 perature range is minimized the torrnation of undesired side-products, and particularly of hydrocarbons: 2. the He/CO ratio also heavily intluences the product distribution. The gradual enrichment of hydrogen in the reactant mixture (in the range He/CO : 0.8- 1.65) causes a progressive increase in the formation of methanol and a decrease in the amounts of C>_ oxygenates. As a result, the methanol/ higher alcohol ratio in the product mixture is significantly increased. On the other hand, the average carbon atom number of the C2. oxyge- nates is not significantly affected by the H2/CO ratio, as well as the formation of methane and higher paraffins; 3. the product distribution results rather unaffected by, the GHSV in the range 9040-15300 Ncc/(h go;,,). The decrease in contact time slightly favors the C2-C3 alcohols production: 4. the addition of methanol to the CO/H_, teed stream does not lead to significant variations in the product distribution, in line with the thermo- dynamic constraints affecting the methanol synth- esis reaction; 5. the addition of ethanol to the teed stream signifi- cantly increases the overall (.7e+ oxygenate produc- tivity (and in particular of 1-propanol and isobutanol), as well as of methyl acetate and of ethane. The results are in line with the key-role of ethanol in the chain growth process to higher oxygenates and also indicate that alcohol mole- cules act as precursors in the formation of hydro- carbons: 6. the results obtained upon ester injection to the CO/ H2 feed stream parallel to those of the correspond- ing alcohols: methyl formate and methyl acetate behave as methanol and ethanol, respectively. This is in line with the thermodynamic constraints affecting the synthesis of esters: 7. water addition does not significantly affect the methanol synthesis reaction, whereas exerts a dra- matic inhibiting effect on the formation of the C.z linear and branched alcohols. This strong inhibiting effect may be related to the presence either of water or of CO2, this last species tbrmed via the WGS reaction. Accordingly the presence of H20 and/or CO2 should be avoided in the feed mixture in order to maximize the production of C-,~ oxygenates. References [11 l.).

An investigation on the effects of the operating conditions on the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from syngas over a Cs-doped CuZnCr oxide catalyst has been performed. The effect of temperature, CO/H2 ratio, space velocity and oxygenates, and water addition to the feed stream has been studied in order to maximize the short-chain alcohols productivity. It has been found that: (i) the reaction temperature is a key-parameter to control the alcohol productivity, and temperatures in the range 560–585 K are adequate for obtaining high production of C2 C3 alcohols. Also, in this temperature range the formation of undesired side-products (hydrocarbons) is minimized, (ii) the gradual enrichment of hydrogen in the reactant mixture (in the range H2/CO = 0.8−1.65) causes a progressive increase in the formation of methanol and a decrease in the amounts of C2+ oxygenates, (iii) the product distribution is rather unaffected by space velocity in the range 9040–15300 Ncc/(h gcat), (iv) the addition of methanol to the CO/H2 feed stream does not leads to significant variations in the product distribution, (v) the addition of ethanol to the feed stream significantly increases the overall C2+ oxygenate productivity, (vi) the results obtained upon ester injection to the CO/H2 feed stream are parallel to those obtained upon injection of the corresponding alcohols, i.e. methyl formate and methyl acetate behave as methanol and ethanol, respectively, (vii) water addition does not significantly affect the methanol synthesis reaction, whereas exerts a dramatic inhibitory effect on the formation of the C2+ linear and branched alcohols.

        "dc:description": "An investigation on the effects of the operating conditions on the higher alcohol synthesis (HAS) from syngas over a Cs-doped CuZnCr oxide catalyst has been performed. The effect of temperature, CO/H2 ratio, space velocity and oxygenates, and water addition to the feed stream has been studied in order to maximize the short-chain alcohols productivity. It has been found that: (i) the reaction temperature is a key-parameter to control the alcohol productivity, and temperatures in the range 560–585 K are adequate for obtaining high production of C2 C3 alcohols. Also, in this temperature range the formation of undesired side-products (hydrocarbons) is minimized, (ii) the gradual enrichment of hydrogen in the reactant mixture (in the range H2/CO = 0.8−1.65) causes a progressive increase in the formation of methanol and a decrease in the amounts of C2+ oxygenates, (iii) the product distribution is rather unaffected by space velocity in the range 9040–15300 Ncc/(h gcat), (iv) the addition of methanol to the CO/H2 feed stream does not leads to significant variations in the product distribution, (v) the addition of ethanol to the feed stream significantly increases the overall C2+ oxygenate productivity, (vi) the results obtained upon ester injection to the CO/H2 feed stream are parallel to those obtained upon injection of the corresponding alcohols, i.e. methyl formate and methyl acetate behave as methanol and ethanol, respectively, (vii) water addition does not significantly affect the methanol synthesis reaction, whereas exerts a dramatic inhibitory effect on the formation of the C2+ linear and branched alcohols. The observed effect of the operating conditions on the HAS have been discussed in the light of the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the synthesis.",
