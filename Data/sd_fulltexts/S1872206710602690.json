DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60269-0 Ceria Modified MnO x /TiO 2 -Pillared Clays Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO with NH 3 at Low Temperature SHEN Boxiong 1, *, YAO Yan 1 , MA Hongqing 1 , LIU Ting 2 1 College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China 2 Sinopec Research Institute of Safety Engineering, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, China Abstract: Titania-pillared clays (TiO 2 -PILC) were synthesized by ion exchange and manganese was introduced as the active phase. The catalytic behavior of the xMn/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts was studied for the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH 3 . A series of Ce-doped 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts were prepared and evaluated for their performance in the low-temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 , their resistance to water vapor (H 2 O), and their resistance to sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). It was found that the NO conversion properties of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts could be significantly improved by adding Ce and all the catalysts gave high resistance to H 2 O but were sensitive to SO 2 . The catalyst with a Ce loading of 2% gave 95% NO conversion at 220 Â°C and exhibited a moderate SO 2 -poisoning resistance compared with the other catalysts. X-ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of NH 3 , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction of H 2 were used to characterize the properties of the catalysts. The addition of Ce improved the diffusion of Mn on the surfaces of the catalysts, which enhanced the surface acidity and improved the reduction properties of the catalysts and these were the main influencing factors for the low-temperature SCR. Key words: low-temperature selective catalytic reduction; titania-pillared interlayered clay; manganese oxide; cerium; poisoning The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH 3 is an efficient technology for NO removal from flue gas for a fixed combustion system [1â€“3]. Because of the multivalent nature of manganese, manganese oxides have been studied extensively as catalysts for the low temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 [4â€“7]. Upon doping MnO x -based catalysts with Fe and Cu a reaction with Mn and an interaction between the mixed oxides influences the oxidative ability of the manganese species, the oxidative ability of the manganese species and the surface structure, which enhances catalytic properties during low temperature SCR [8â€“10]. Ceria (CeO 2 ), as a good oxygen reservoir, has attracted considerable interest because of its oxygen storage and redox properties [11â€“13]. Wu et al. [14] prepared ceria modified MnO x /TiO 2 and found that the intro- duction of Ce improved the oxygen mobility and the NH 3 chemisorption ability of the catalysts resulting in improved SCR activity. The resistance to SO 2 was found to be greatly enhanced for Ce modified MnO x -based catalysts during low temperature SCR [15]. Additionally, MnO x -CeO 2 has been found to have high activity with 90%â€“100% selectivity for N 2 during the low temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 [4,6,16]. Catalyst supports are also believed to be important for SCR performance as they possess high surface areas, good thermal stability, and high active substance dispersion on surfaces [17,18]. PeÃ±a et al. [19] investigated NO conversion over TiO 2 -supported manganese oxides and concluded that metal-support interactions determined the redox properties of the catalyst and its SCR activity. Jin et al. [20] loaded Mn-Ce oxides onto TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 and found that carriers play an important role in NO conversion as they provide different acid sites and reaction pathways for the reaction. Pillared interlayered clays (PILC) are two-dimensional zeo- lite-like materials, and are of interest because of their adjust- able pore size distribution, their high thermal stability, and their SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 low cost [21,22]. The use of PILC in the SCR of NO by NH 3 from 250 to 450 Â°C has been studied. Yang et al. [22] synthe- sized and tested the following five pillared clays based cata- lysts: Cr 2 O 3 -PILC, Fe 2 O 3 -PILC, TiO 2 -PILC, ZrO 2 -PILC, and Al 2 O 3 - PILC for the SCR reaction. They found that pillared clays are a promising class of catalysts for SCR applications because they have high N 2 selectivity between 250â€“450 Â°C. Cheng et al. [23] reported that the Fe 2 O 3 -Cr 2 O 3 /TiO 2 -PILC catalyst has higher activity and higher N 2 selectivity than commercial V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 catalysts, even in the presence of H 2 O and SO 2 in flue gas. Chmielarz et al. [24] found that the in- troduction of copper into Ti- or Al-pillared montmorillonites showed high activities during DeNO x process between 250â€“450 Â°C. Despite the fact that pillared clays based materials have been extensively studied for the SCR of NO with NH 3 from 250 to 450 Â°C, few studies have been carried out on these materials for the low temperature SCR [25]. In this paper, catalysts con- sisting of Mn-supported Ti-pillared clays with Ce modification were prepared and tested for the low temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 . 1 Experimental 1.1 Synthesis of the catalysts Purified bentonite (Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Re- search Institute, Tianjin, China) was used as the raw material. The bentonite was dispersed in a beaker containing a wa- ter-acetone mixture as the solvent to create a suspended slurry. The clay slurry was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. A titanium pillaring solution was obtained by slowly adding tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ) to 5.0 mol/L HCl at a H/Ti mol ratio of 2.0. The solution was stirred for 30 min and then aged for 3 h at room temperature. The obtained oligomeric solution was added dropwise into a suspension of the clay with vigorous stirring. The resulting solution containing 15 mmol of Ti per gram of clay was stirred for another 6 h and aged over 12 h at room temperature. After that, the solid fraction was separated by centrifugation and washed several times with distilled water until the liquid phase was chloride-free. The obtained samples were then dried at 80 Â°C to obtain the TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. Manganese oxides were introduced by the incipient wetness impregnation of TiO 2 -PILCs with a proper amount of Mn(NO 3 ) 2 . The obtained materials were then dried at 80 Â°C for 12 h and calcined in air at 550 Â°C for 6 h. The catalysts are denoted xMn/TiO 2 -PILC. The cerium-added samples were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation by adding Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O to the Mn(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution. Subse- quent drying and calcination were carried out as for the xMn/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. The final Ce-doped catalysts are referred to as xMn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILCs catalysts where x and y represent the mass ratio of Mn and Ce on the support, respec- tively. 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts The textural parameters of the samples were determined by N 2 sorption at â€“196 Â°C using a NOVA 2000 automated gas sorption system (Quantachrome Instruments, USA). The spe- cific surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution of the catalysts were determined by BET or BJH methods. The crystal structures of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/Max-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Japan) with monochromatized Cu K Ä® radiation (Èœ = 0.15405 nm). A broad scan analysis was carried out in the 2È™ range from 3Â° to 80Â° at a scan speed of 4â€“8Â°/min. The total acidity and the acid distribution of the catalysts were measured by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH 3 on a TP5080 with a TCD detector (xq-instrument, Tianjin, China). About 0.1 g sample (sieved to 0.2â€“0.3 mm) was inserted into a fixed-bed flow reactor using nitrogen as the flow gas. The samples were pretreated for 30 min at 550 Â°C and then cooled to room temperature. The in- troduction of NH 3 was carried out over 30 min followed by a purge with nitrogen to remove the physically adsorbed NH 3 on the catalyst surface. Desorption under nitrogen was then carried out at 100â€“500 Â°C with a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of H 2 ex- periments were also carried out on the TP5080. The samples (0.1 g) were loaded and pretreated at 550 Â°C in an atmosphere of N 2 and the samples cooled to room temperature. After that, the samples were reduced by 5%H 2 -95%N 2 at a flow rate of 30 ml/min from room temperature to 900 Â°C at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to de- termine the surface atomic state of the catalysts using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with monochromated Al K Ä® radiation (1486.6 eV, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Charging of the catalyst samples was corrected by the binding energy of C 1s (284.6 eV) as an internal reference. The oper- ating pressure was determined at room temperature and at a pressure of 1 u 10 â€“7 Pa. 1.3 Catalytic activities The SCR catalytic experiments were performed at atmos- pheric pressure in a fixed-bed stainless steel flow reactor (i.d. 1 cm) [26]. The temperature of the reactor was monitored and controlled by thermocouples that were inserted into the center of the catalyst bed. The reactant gases were fed to the reactor by an electronic mass flow controller. The composition of the initial gas mixture with a flux of 300 ml/min was as follows: NO 0.06 vol%, NH 3 0.06 vol%, O 2 3 vol%, H 2 O 3 vol% (when used) SO 2 0.01 vol% (when used), and pure N 2 as balance. The NH 3 -SCR experiments were performed over 0.5 g catalyst SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 (60â€“80 mesh) from 80 to 240 Â°C and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 50000 h Ã­1 . NO from the reactor was analyzed using a flue gas analyzer (KM900; Kane International Ltd.). NO conversion was calculated as follows: NO conversion = (NO in â€“ NO out )/NO in Ã— 100% where NO in is the NO concentration of the reactor inlet, and NO out is the NO concentration of the exit of the reactor. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalytic performance of the xMn/TiO 2 -PILCs cata- lysts The xMn/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts with different Mn loadings were evaluated for the SCR of NO using NH 3 as a function of temperature. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Only 15% NO conversion was obtained over the pure TiO 2 -PILC at 240 Â°C. The addition of manganese to the TiO 2 -PILC increased the NO conversion greatly and this depended on the amount of Mn. The 2%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst gave a small increase in SCR activity from 180 to 240 Â°C. There was an obviously variation in NO conversion with an increase in Mn content from 4% to 10% and the best activity was obtained over the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst, which gave nearly 100% conver- sion at 220 Â°C. However, NO conversion decreased with a further increase in the Mn content from 8% to 10%. The SCR activity decreased as follows: 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC > 6%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC Â§ 10%Mn/ TiO 2 -PILC > 4%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC > 2%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC > TiO 2 - PILC. By a comparison of the activities of the 8%Mn supported on the Ti-pillared clays with that on un-pillared clays we found that the 8%Mn/PILC cata- lyst only gave 37% NO conversion at 220 Â°C, which is much lower than that of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst. The inter- calation of Ti with the clays is thus necessary for low tem- perature SCR support. Moreover, temperature plays a vital role in the activity of the catalysts, as reported in previous studies [11,27]. According to the results shown in Fig. 1, NO conversion remained mostly constant below 20% for all the catalysts from 80 to 120 Â°C while a sharply increase in NO conversion was found with an increase in temperature from 120 to 240 Â°C. 2.2 Promoting effect of cerium Since the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst was found to be an optimal SCR catalyst the promoting effects of ceria (CeO 2 ) on the SCR activities were studied over the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst. The NO conversion in the SCR reaction over the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts with different cerium load- ings is shown in Fig. 2. NO conversion for the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILCs catalysts increased continuously with an increase in the reaction tem- perature. All the samples gave 90% NO conversion at 220 Â°C. Figure 2 shows that the SCR activity decreased as follows: 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn-1%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn-4%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn- 6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC. It is clear that at a Ce loading of 2% the catalyst gives superior NO reduction activity while at a Ce loading of more than 2% the NO conversion decreases. These results are in good agreement with previous studies [14,28]. It is reasonable to speculate that there is an optimal ceria content beyond which the overloaded Ce would cover the active sites and thus improvements to the SCR reaction would be small or even negative. 2.3 Characterization results of the catalysts 2.3.1 BET surface area and pore diameter analysis The BET surface areas (A BET ), pore volumes (V p ), and av- erage pore diameters (D p ) of three selected 8%Mn-yCe/ 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 0 20 40 60 80 100 TiO 2 -PILCs 2%Mn/TiO 2 -PILCs 4%Mn/TiO 2 -PILCs 6%Mn/TiO 2 -PILCs 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILCs 10%Mn/TiO 2 -PILCs N O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Temperature ( o C) Fig. 1.

SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 TiO 2 -PILC (y = 0, 2%, and 6%) catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface area and pore volume of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst are 133.7 m 2 /g and 0.1319 cm 3 /g, respectively. With an increase in Ce loading the BET and the pore volumes of the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts de- creased slightly. This might be a consequence of partially blocked pores because of the addition of ceria [29]. The cata- lysts are dominated by mesopores and they have a small ratio of micropores as determined by the t-plot method. Figure 3(a) shows N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the selected catalysts at â€“196 o C. For the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC cata- lysts the isotherms closely resemble type and type IV isÄŠ o- therms (according to IUPAC), which indicates the existence of mesoporous pores in the sample. In addition, the hysteresis loop is of the H3 type implying that the catalysts have typical slit-like pores. This fact is consistent with their pore size dis- tributions (Fig. 3(b)). For the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC and 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC samples the isotherms are equivalent to that of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst. The three catalysts have similar pore distributions with pore diameters of about 3.9 nm. 2.3.2 XRD XRD spectra of purified bentonite, the TiO 2 -PILC, the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst, and the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. As indicated in Fig. 4 the reflec- tion of the basal (001) at 7.16Â° is obvious for the PILC sample and the two-dimensional hk reflections are present at 2T angles of 19.8Â° and 34.9Â°. The peaks at 26.6Â° and 28Â° are reflections of quartz and cristobalite impurities in the clay [28,30,31]. Typi- cal clay diffractions were also found for the TiO 2 -PILC except for the (001) reflection, as was reported for the delaminated TiO 2 -PILC [32,33]. No reflections of TiO 2 phases were pre- sent. The addition of Mn did not result in a change in the posi- tions or shapes of the typical diffractions of the Ti-pillared clay but a decrease in intensity was observed as the Mn content increased. This implies that Mn and the TiO 2 -PILC may be in intimate contact and the interaction significantly influences the structure of the TiO 2 -PILC. As for the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst, diffraction peaks at- tributed to crystalline Mn 2 O 3 and MnO 2 were identified. After the addition of cerium oxide the diffraction peaks of Mn 2 O 3 at 2T = 32.8Â°, 38.25Â°, and 55.24Â° became smaller and practically disappeared at a Ce content of 4%. Peaks for the crystalline CeO 2 phase were not found in any of the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. This indicates that CeO 2 was amorphous and the presence of ceria led to a better dispersion of manganese on the TiO 2 -PILC.

SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 therefore exist between manganese and ceria, which inhibits crystallization for both species. As reported previously, amorphous MnO x gives good performance for the SCR of NO with NH 3 while the crystalline phase contributes little to the SCR reaction [4,17,27,34]. 2.3.3 NH 3 -TPD The adsorption abilities of NH 3 over the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC and 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts were probed by NH 3 -TPD and their profiles are shown in Fig. 5. A sharp NH 3 desorption peak is present at about 160 Â°C for all the catalysts. Additionally, a weak NH 3 desorption peak at 450 Â°C appeared for the 8%Mn-1%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC, 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC and 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. The peak at about 160 ÂºC is considered to arise from the desorption of ammonia that was bound to the weak BrÃ¶nsted acid sites while the NH 3 de- sorption at high temperature was due to NH 3 that desorbed from the Lewis centers [35]. The addition of Ce introduced some Lewis type centers, which are much stronger than BrÃ¶n- sted acid sites. This is a possible reason for the higher activity of the Ce-doped catalyst. The adsorption capacity of NH 3 on the catalyst surface is believed to be crucial for the SCR reac- tion [36,37]. The total amount of NH 3 that was desorbed de- creases as follows: 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn-1%Ce/ TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn-4%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC Â§ 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC > 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC. The surface acidities of the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILCs catalysts increased upon loading with small amounts of Ce while the acidities of the catalysts de- creased with a high Ce loading. The adsorption properties of NH 3 over the tested catalysts correlate well with their catalytic activities in the SCR reaction. 2.3.4 H 2 -TPR Figure 6 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the TiO 2 -PILCs, 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC, and 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. The TiO 2 -PILCs showed no obvious H 2 consumption peak over the whole temperature range, as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, all the H 2 consumption peaks for the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC were due to the reduction of manganese species. The H 2 -TPR profile of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC was characterized by two overlapping re- duction peaks at 422 and 486 Â°C. Although there are many similarities such as the preparation method, the support, and the H 2 test conditions during the reduction of the active phase in qualitative and quantitative terms [38], similar properties were found for the MnO x -loaded catalysts. The two-step re- duction process on the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC can be broken down as follows [14,39,40]: the first reduction peak at 422 Â°C cor- responds to the reduction of MnO 2 /Mn 2 O 3 to Mn 3 O 4 and the other peak at 486 Â°C is due to the reduction of Mn 3 O 4 to MnO. Compared with the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC the reduction features of the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC were dramatically modified because of the addition of Ce. Tang et al. [41] previously stated that the addition of ceria to manganese oxide accelerated the mobility of the surface oxygen species and led to an easier reduction of manganese oxide. It is interesting to note that for the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts the temperature of the first peak at 422 Â°C gradually shifted to lower temperatures until a loading of 2%, and when the Ce loading was higher than 2% the first reduction peaks shifted back to higher temperature. This means that the reduction ability at low temperature in- creased for Ce loadings less than 2% and then decreased as more ceria oxides species were added. Similar reduction characteristics were also observed over the Ce modified MnO x /TiO 2 catalysts by Wu et al. [14]. Moreover, with an increase in ceria content the temperature of the first reduction peak increased and overlapped with the second reduction peak at 400 Â°C for the 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst.

SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 reported that the redox abilities of the catalysts influence their catalytic activity [41]. In our experiments, changes in the re- duction properties at low temperature for the 8%Mn-yCe/ TiO 2 -PILC catalysts were consistent with their SCR activities. CeO 2 has two reduction peaks at about 500 and 800 Â°C be- cause of the reduction of surface and bulk oxygen in CeO 2 , respectively [43]. For the studied 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts no independent reduction peaks attributable to CeO 2 were observed. This illustrates the good interaction between cerium and manganese in the Ce-added catalysts. Therefore, the single reduction peak at 400 Â°C for the 8%Mn-yCe/ TiO 2 -PILC mainly corresponds to the reduction of MnO 2 / Mn 2 O 3 ÄºMn 3 O 4 and the surface reduction of Ce 4+ ÄºCe 3+ may also be included in this process. Delimaris et al. [40] proposed that the reduction of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ can take place with the re- duction of manganese ions during the H 2 -TPR of the MnO x -CeO 2 catalysts that were prepared by a urea combustion method. 2.3.5 XPS The surface elemental concentrations for the 8%Mn/ TiO 2 -PILC and 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC (y = 2% and 6%) catalysts are shown in Table 2. The photoelectron peaks of Mn 2p, Ce 3d, and O 1s are shown in Fig. 7. For the three samples, two main peaks due to Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 are present be- tween 636 to 660 eV. The binding energies of Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2 indicate a mixed-valence manganese system (Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ) [14,26], which agrees with the above XRD results. As shown in Table 2, no Ce is present on the surface of 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC indicating that Ce is preferentially well dispersed on the surface of the catalysts, as shown by XRD. The Ce 3d XPS spectra of the 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst gave six features of Ce 4+ (U+U''+U'''+V'''+V''+V) and two features of Ce 3+ (U'+V'), as shown in Fig. 7(b) [14,44]. These results confirm that Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ coexist on the surface of the catalysts and that the Ce 4+ oxidation state is dominant. The XPS spectra for O1s shows that two distinct peaks are present on the catalysts investigated [40]. The O 1s XPS spec- tra show a main peak at a binding energy of 529.6â€“530.0 eV and this is assigned to lattice oxygen (denoted OÈ•) from the metal oxides. The peak at 531.5â€“532.7 eV corresponds to chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the catalysts (donated OÄ®). The surface chemisorbed oxygen has been reported to favor the reduction of NO during the SCR process [44]. Table 2 and Fig. 7 indicates that the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst with the highest chemisorbed oxygen has better NO conversion compared with the other catalysts. 2.4 Activity of the catalysts in the presence of H 2 O and SO 2 Since water vapor and/or SO 2 are intrinsic components of flue gas, it is necessary to study the activities of the catalysts in the presence of H 2 O and/or SO 2 at low temperature. Figure 8(a) illustrates the effect of H 2 O on NO conversion over the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC and 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts at different reaction temperatures. For the three catalysts the conversion of NO remained constant during the test time in- dicating that the catalysts, based on the TiO 2 -PILC gave good Table 2 Elemental concentrations on the surface of the catalysts Surface elemental concentration (%) Sample Ce Mn OÄ® OÈ• 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC â€” 7.82 63.31 8.57 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC â€” 6.72 77.10 2.56 8%Mn-6%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC 0.86 6.99 57.70 12.23 540 538 536 534 532 530 528 526 660 655 650 645 640 930 920 910 900 890 880 Bingding energy (eV) I n t e n s i t y I n t e n s i t y Bingding energy (eV) (1) (2) (3) OD OE O 1s (c) Mn 2p 3/2 I n t e n s i t y Bingding energy (eV) (2) (3) Mn 2p 1/2Mn 2p (a) (1) (3) VV'V'' V'''UU'U''U''' Ce 3d (b) Fig. 7.

SHEN Boxiong et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1803â€“1811 resistance to H 2 O at 200 Â°C. The effects of H 2 O on NO con- version over the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst at different temperatures was also studied and is shown in Fig. 8(b). When 3 vol% H 2 O was introduced into the flue gas at 160 Â°C the NO conversion over the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst de- creased from 57% to 52% and NO conversion was almost restored to its original value as H 2 O was discontinued. After 2 h of a steady reaction at 160 Â°C the reaction temperature in- creased to 200 Â°C and 3 vol% H 2 O was added again. NO conversion remained at 91.5%, which is the NO conversion obtained for the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst in the ab- sence of H 2 O at 200 Â°C. The results indicate that the inhibition effect of H 2 O is related to the SCR reaction temperature and the poisoning effect was reversible. Figure 9 shows the synergistic effects of SO 2 and H 2 O on the SCR activity of the catalysts at 200 Â°C. The results indicated that when 3 vol% H 2 O and 0.01 vol% SO 2 were added to the reaction gas the activities of the catalysts decreased signifi- cantly in just a few hours. The NO conversion of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst decreased from 75% to 28% in 2 h. The NO conversion did not recover even when SO 2 was re- moved from the flue gas. This clearly indicates that SO 2 has irreversible poisoning effects on the activity of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst under low temperature SCR condi- tions. The deactivation of Mn/TiO 2 in the presence of SO 2 was also observed by Jin et al. [45]. Depositions of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and NH 4 HSO 4 have been found on a Mn/TiO 2 surface at low tem- perature, which has led to an irreversible decrease in NO conversion. Deactivation by H 2 O and SO 2 was also observed over the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts. The activities of the 8%Mn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts were relatively higher than that of the 8%Mn/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst in presence of H 2 O and SO 2 . Compared with other catalysts, the 8%Mn-2%Ce/ TiO 2 -PILC catalyst deactivation rate was especially delayed. The addition of Ce, especially at a loading of 2%, suppresses the deactivation to a degree although the SO 2 resistances of the xMn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts are weak. 3 Conclusions Cerium modified MnO x /TiO 2 -PILC catalysts were prepared and showed high activity for the low temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 . We found that Ti-pillared clays are a promising support for the low temperature SCR and that an optimal con- tent of added ceria exists. For the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst the incorporation of cerium resulted in a good disper- sion of manganese oxides on the surface of the catalysts. The reduction properties of the manganese oxides improved by the introduction of cerium and the XPS results confirmed that the higher amount of chemisorbed oxygen present on the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO 2 -PILC catalyst facilitated the low-temperature SCR of NO with NH 3 . Furthermore, strong Lewis acid sites were created when a proper amount of cerium was added. All the catalysts based on the TiO 2 -PILC catalyst showed good resistance to H 2 O while the presence of SO 2 and H 2 O resulted in the deactivation of the catalysts. More work is required to improve the H 2 O and SO 2 resistance of the xMn-yCe/TiO 2 -PILC catalysts at low temperature. References 1 Long R Q, Yang R T. Appl Catal B, 2000, 24:13 2 Liu F D, He H.

Tel: +86-22-23503219; Fax: +86-22-23508807 Abstract Titania-pillared clays (TiO2-PILC) were synthesized by ion exchange and manganese was introduced as the active phase. The catalytic behavior of the xMn/TiO2-PILC catalysts was studied for the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3. A series of Ce-doped 8%Mn-yCe/TiO2-PILC catalysts were prepared and evaluated for their performance in the low-temperature SCR of NO with NH3, their resistance to water vapor (H2O), and their resistance to sulfur dioxide (SO2). It was found that the NO conversion properties of the 8%Mn/TiO2-PILC catalysts could be significantly improved by adding Ce and all the catalysts gave high resistance to H2O but were sensitive to SO2. The catalyst with a Ce loading of 2% gave 95% NO conversion at 220 °C and exhibited a moderate SO2-poisoning resistance compared with the other catalysts. X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed reduction of H2 were used to characterize the properties of the catalysts. The addition of Ce improved the diffusion of Mn on the surfaces of the catalysts, which enhanced the surface acidity and improved the reduction properties of the catalysts and these were the main influencing factors for the low-temperature SCR. 摘要 采用离子交换法制备了钛基层柱粘土 (TiO2-PILC), 并应用浸渍法将 Mn 负载于其上制得不同 Mn 含量的 xMn/TiO2-PILCs 催化剂, 考察了催化剂低温 NH3 选择性催化还原 NO (NH3-SCR) 活性, 研究了添加 Ce 对 8%Mn/TiO2-PILC 催化剂活性及其抗水蒸气抗 SO2 特性的影响. 结果发现, TiO2-PILC 负载的锰基催化剂具有良好的抗水蒸气性能, 但在水蒸气和 SO2 共存时失活严重. Ce 的添加对催化剂活性以及抗 SO2 能力均有所提高, 其中 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO2-PILC 在 200 oC 时 NO 去除率达到 95%, 同时 SO2 失活速率明显比其他催化剂低. 采用 N2 吸附-脱附、X 射线衍射、NH3 程序升温脱附、H2 程序升温还原和 X 射线光电子能谱等技术对催化剂结构和性质进行了表征. 结果表明, 所制备催化剂具有丰富的中孔结构和较大的比表面积; Ce 的添加使 Mn 在催化剂表面分散性更好, 提高了催化剂表面酸性和催化剂氧化还原性能, 从而使其活性和抗硫性能增加. Graphical abstract The addition of Ce to 8%Mn/TiO2-pillared clays (PILC) catalysts significantly improved NO conversion during the SCR and the resistance to SO2 during low temperature selective catalytic reduction. The higher catalytic activity of the 8%Mn-2%Ce/TiO2-PILC catalyst is due to its better reduction behavior at low temperature and its higher number of acid sites.
