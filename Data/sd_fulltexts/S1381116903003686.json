Graphic The ultrafine Fe-doped Ni-B amorphous catalyst (Ni-Fe-B) was prepared by reducing mixed FeCl3 and NiCl2 with KBH4 in aqueous solution. At suitable Fe-content (χFe), the Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the corresponding undoped Ni-B in the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA). With the increase of χFe, the activity first increased and then decreased while the selectivity to FFA changed in a contrast way. The Fe-B amorphous alloy itself was inactive for the FFR hydrogenation. The optimum χFe was determined as 0.51, at which the FFA yield reached 100% after reaction for 4h. Based on various characterizations, the promoting effect of the Fe-dopant was discussed by considering (1) the increase in the surface area, more highly unsaturated Ni active sites, and the more homogeneous distribution of the Ni active sites owing to the presence of Fe2O3 as a dopant; (2) the affinity of the Fe3+ for the oxygen in the carbonyl group which strengthened the adsorption of the CO bond by the catalyst and thus facilitated its hydrogenation; (3) the electron donation of the metallic Fe to the metallic Ni, making Fe electron-deficient while Ni electron-enriched which activated the CO bond towards the hydrogenation. Keywords Furfural (FFR) Hydrogenation Furfuryl alcohol (FFA) Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalyst 1 Introduction Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) is an important industrial reaction since the product furfuryl alcohol (FFA) is widely used in polymers, fine chemicals, and farm chemicals [1,2]. Gas phase hydrogenation is adopted in most companies, while in some countries, e.g. in China, liquid phase hydrogenation is also frequently employed [3–6]. During the hydrogenation of FFR, various products may be produced, as shown in the following reaction route [3]: Obviously, the catalyst plays a key role in determining the selectivity to FFA [6]. Up to now, only a few catalysts have been reported for the FFR hydrogenation to FFA [3,7], among them the Cu-Cr based catalysts are most frequently employed. The disadvantage of the Cu-Cr based catalysts is their high toxicity, which causes severe environmental pollution. The Ni-B amorphous alloy has been proved to be an excellent catalyst for many hydrogenating reactions [8–16]. However, it exhibits unsatisfactory activity and especially, the low selectivity to FFA when used in the FFR hydrogenation. It is well known that addition of a transition metal to form a bimetallic catalyst may improve both the activity and selectivity and even the stability during the hydrogenation [17]. This paper reports a novel Fe-promoted Ni-B amorphous catalyst (Ni-Fe-B) which seems powerful in the FFR hydrogenation to FFA. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni-Fe-B samples were prepared in the following procedure: at room temperature, 32ml 2.0M KBH4 aqueous solution containing 0.2M NaOH was added dropwise within 2.0h into 20ml NiCl2 aqueous solution containing 1.0g Ni and a certain amount of FeCl3. The KBH4 was greatly excessive to ensure the complete reduction of the metallic ions in the solution. During the addition of KBH4, the solution was stirred vigorously. After complete reaction, the resulting black solid was washed free from Cl− and K+ ions as well as some soluble boron species with distilled H2O (until pH 7 was obtained). Then, it was further washed with absolute alcohol (EtOH) and finally, stored in EtOH until the time of use. The content of the Fe-dopant in the Ni-Fe-B catalyst, expressed in the Fe/(Fe+Ni) molar ratio (χFe), was adjusted by changing the amount of FeCl3 in the solution. For comparison, the Ni-B (χ Fe=0) and the Fe-B (χ Fe=1) samples were also prepared in the similar way but using single NiCl2 or FeCl3 as the catalyst precursor. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The amorphous characteristics of the Ni-Fe-B catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8-Advance with Cu Kα radiation) and selective area electron diffraction (SAED). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a SETARAM DSC 111 computer-thermal analysis system under Ar atmosphere with a heating rate of 5K/min. Alloy compositions were analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma (ICP, Jarrell-As Scan 2000). BET surface areas (S BET) were measured by nitrogen adsorption at 77K after degassing at 373K for 2.0h. The surface morphology and the particle size were determined by means of both the transmission electron micrography (TEM, JEM-2010) and the scanning electron micrograph (SEM, XL 30 Philips). Ni and Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) were obtained in the National Laboratory of High Energy Physics (BL-10B, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). Data were treated by using the EXAFS (II) program [18]. The surface electronic states were determined with a X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Perkin-Elmer PH I 5000C). Slight Ar+ sputtering was employed to remove surface impurities. All binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by using the value of contaminant carbon (C 1S=284.6eV) as a reference. 2.3 Activity test The hydrogenation reaction was carried out in a stainless autoclave containing 10ml FFR, 30ml EtOH and 1.0g catalyst at the reaction conditions of P H2 =1.0MPa and T=373K. The stirring effect was preliminarily investigated and a stirring rate of 1000rpm was employed, this turned out to be sufficient to eliminate the diffusion limit. According to the drop of H2 pressure with the time, the hydrogen uptake rates, i.e. the hydrogen consumption per hour and per gram Ni (R H2 , mmol H2/hg Ni) were calculated according to the ideal gas equation. After reaction for 4h, the FFR conversion and the selectivity to FFA was measured by gas chromatographic analysis (GC 1102) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The conditions for the analysis were as follows: OV 101 column, injector temperature 373K, oven temperature 393K, detector temperature 423K, and carrier gas N2, 30ml/min. In each run of analysis, the total carbon content detected in the reaction mixture was almost the same as that in the initially added FFR, showing that there existed a carbon balance before and after FFR hydrogenation. Thus, one can conclude that no other products were left out during the present GC analysis. The reproducibility of the results was checked by repeating the runs at least three times on the same batch of catalyst and for another three times for a different batches of catalyst and was found to be within acceptable limits (±5% for the same batch of the catalyst and ±10% for the different batches of the catalyst). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the HRTEM morphology of the as-prepared Ni-Fe-B sample, from which one can see that the Ni-Fe-B sample was present in the form of spherical particles with the average diameter around 30nm. Those particles were surrounded by a large quantity of white gel-like substances. They could be attributed to both the boron and iron oxides which could be confirmed by XPS spectra, as discussed below. The XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2 , revealed that all the fresh Ni-Fe-B samples were present in the amorphous structure similar to that of the undoped Ni-B sample, since only one broad peak around 2θ=45° was observed [19]. After annealing at 873K in N2 for 2h, the original broad peak disappeared and several diffractional peaks corresponding to the crystalline Ni2B alloy, Fe2B alloy, Ni-Fe-B alloy, Ni-Fe alloy, and metallic Ni phases appeared, showing that the amorphous structure was thermodynamically metastable [20] and the as-prepared Ni-Fe-B may undergo a crystallization together with a decomposition at high temperature. The weak peaks corresponding to the Fe phases suggested that these Fe species were highly dispersed. The amorphous characteristics of the as-prepared Ni-Fe-B catalysts could be further confirmed by SAED, which displayed various diffractional cycles characteristic of the amorphous structure [21] for the fresh Ni-Fe-B sample and only some bright points after being treated at 873K for 2h, as shown in Fig. 3 . The DSC analysis, as shown in Fig. 4 , demonstrated that the crystallization temperature (T C) strongly depended on χFe. The T C increased rapidly with the increase of χFe, as summarized in Table 1 , showing the stabilizing effect of the Fe-dopant on the amorphous structure, possibly due to the effective inhibition of the migration and gathering of catalyst particles, which were essential for the crystallization of amorphous alloys [22,23]. Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of the Ni-Fe-B amorphous alloy in Ni2P, Fe2P and B1S levels, respectively. One can see that almost all the Ni species were present in the metallic state corresponding to the binding energy of 852.7eV [24]. However, the Fe species were present in both the metallic state and the oxidized state (Fe2O3) corresponding to BE of 707.1 and 711.2eV, respectively [25]. Such Fe2O3 species could be effectively removed when the sample was treated with dilute ammonia solution. However, the Ar+ sputtering could not remove these Fe2O3 species, showing that they were not produced from the surface oxidation. The Fe2O3 species may be formed via the hydrolysis of Fe3+ ions taking into account that the KBH4 solution containing 0.2M NaOH was strongly alkaline. Similarly, the B species were also present in two states, the alloying B and the oxidized B (B2O3) corresponding to BE values of 188.0 and 192.5eV, respectively [24]. The BE of the alloying B positively shifted by 0.9eV in comparison with the standard BE of the pure B (187.1eV) [24]. Similarly, by comparing with the standard BE of pure Fe metal (706.6eV) [25], it was also found that the metallic Fe in the Ni-Fe-B sample shifted positively by 0.5eV. These results demonstrated that partial electrons transferred from both Fe and B to Ni in the Ni-Fe-B amorphous alloy, i.e. the alloying B and metallic Fe were electron-deficient while the metallic Ni was electron-enriched. The electronic interaction between the alloying B and the metallic Ni in the Ni-B amorphous alloy has been well studied [15,26–31], while, by using soft X-ray appearance potential spectroscopy, Chouresia and Chopra also confirmed the electron transfer from Fe to Ni in the Ni-Fe alloy [32]. In our previous papers [24], we reported that, because of the larger size of Ni atom than that of B, the BE of the metallic Ni in the Ni-B amorphous alloy remained almost unchanged comparing to the standard BE value of the pure Ni metal (853.1eV) even though B donated partial electrons. However, significant BE shift of the metallic Ni (ca. 0.4eV) was observed in the Ni-Fe-B sample, showing that the Ni atom got more electrons since the Fe-dopant donated additional electrons besides the alloying B. Table 1 shows the effect of the Fe-dopant on the physical properties of the as-prepared Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalysts. The change of χFe had very little influence on the boron content. However, the surface area (BET) of the Ni-Fe-B sample increased considerably with the increase of χFe, which was mainly attributed to the decrease in the particle size owing to the dispersing effect of the Fe2O3 support. This was strongly supported by the SEM morphologies, as shown in Fig. 6 . Based on the calculations from the Ni K-edge EXAFS data, it was found that the change of χFe had no significant effect on the inter-atomic distance (R). However, the coordination number (N) decreased with the increase of χFe, showing that the Ni active sites became more highly unsaturated owing to decrease in the particle size. The D–W factor (σ), which represents the disordering term in the nearest neighbors, first increased and then decreased with the increase of χFe. The maximum σ was obtained at χ Fe=0.51, showing that the presence of suitable amount of the Fe-dopant may favor the homogeneous distribution of the Ni active sites [26]. At extremely low content (χ Fe<0.11), no significant effect of the Fe-dopant on both the structural and electronic characteristics of the as-prepared Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalyst was observed. A possible explanation is that, at extremely low content, these Fe atoms were mainly present as isolated atoms in the Ni lattice rather than as the alloying Fe with Ni [33]. Figs. 7 and 8 show the dependence of the FFR conversion, the selectivity to FFA, and the RH2 on χFe, from which the following results could be obtained: 1. Effect the Fe-dopant on the activity. With the increase of χFe, the activity of Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalysts first increased and then decreased. The maximum activity was obtained at χ Fe=0.51. As the Fe-B amorphous alloy itself was inactive for the FFR hydrogenation, one might conclude that only the metallic Ni served as the active site in the Ni-Fe-B amorphous alloy and the Fe-dopant served as a promoter. As discussed above, the addition of very small amount of the Fe-dopant (χ Fe<0.11) had no significant effect on both the structural and the electronic characteristics of the Ni-Fe-B catalyst. Thus, the promoting effect of the Fe-dopant at such a low content could be attributed to the presence of isolated Fe atoms in the Ni lattice. Yadav and Kharkara [33] found that, the Fe atoms in the Ni lattice were more active than the Ni atoms. At χFe from 0.11 to 0.51, the promoting effect of the Fe-dopant may be accounted by considering the presence of both the metallic Fe and the Fe2O3. Concerning the role of the metallic Fe, the aforementioned XPS spectra revealed that the metallic Fe donated partial electrons to Ni similar to that of the alloying B. On one hand, the electron-deficient Fe could attract the oxygen in the carbonyl group via a side-bond interaction [34–36], as shown in the following model, which might weaken and activate the CO bond π-complexed to the Ni atom and in turn promote the hydrogenation of the CO bond. On the other hand, according to the studies on the CO adsorption on transition metals [37,38], the primary interactions are the forward donation from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of CO, i.e. from 5σ to the surface d z 2 and s states, and the back donation from metal d x 2−y 2 to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CO, i.e. 2π∗. As 2π∗ is an antibonding orbital, increased back donation from the metal could weaken the CO bond and thus, favors the dissociation of the CO bond. Since the metallic Ni was more electron-enriched in the presence of the Fe-dopant, the Ni active sites became more electrons would back donate from Ni to 2π∗ of the CO bond which also facilitated the hydrogenation of CO bond. Concerning the role of Fe2O3, it is well known that the affinity of the Fe3+ for the oxygen in the carbonyl group might also activate the CO bond [39]. Meanwhile, the Fe2O3 could serve as a support that enhanced the surface area, created the more highly unsaturated Ni active sites and also promoted the more homogeneous distribution of these Ni active sites, as shown in Table 1. All these factors were favorable for the hydrogenation activity [13]. At very large concentration of the Fe-dopant, the activity decreased again since too many surface Ni active sites would be covered by the inactive Fe species. 2. Effect of the Fe-dopant on the selectivity. Under the present conditions, the main byproduct was determined as tetrahydrofurfural (HFFR), resulting from the competitive hydrogenation of the furan ring, as shown in the above reaction route. Addition of small amount of the Fe-dopants (χ Fe<0.11) may facilitate the formation of HFFR, resulting in an abrupt drop in the selectivity to FFA. This could be attributed to presence of the isolated Fe atoms existed in the Ni lattice. They were so active that both the CO group and the furan ring could be hydrogenated [24]. When χFe further increased, the selectivity to FFA regained and increased rapidly up to 100% at χ Fe=0.16. Besides the coverage of the isolated Fe atoms originally existed in the Ni-lattice, the promoting effect of the Fe-dopant on the selectivity could be mainly attributed to both the metallic Fe and Fe2O3. As discussed above, both the electron-deficient Fe atoms and the Fe3+ species could activate the CO bond via a side-bond adsorption of the oxygen in carbonyl group. Meanwhile, the more electron-enriched Ni atoms could also activate the CO bond due to the more back donation of the electrons from the Ni atom to the 2π∗ antibonding orbitals of the CO group. Thus, with the increase of χ Fe, the hydrogenation of the CO group became easier than that of the furan ring, resulting in the higher selectivity to FFA. 3. Effect of the alloying boron on the catalytic behaviors. In our previous paper [40], the catalytic behaviors of both the Ni-B amorphous alloy catalyst prepared from the reduction of Ni2+ with KBH4 and the Ni powder catalyst obtained from the reduction of Ni2+ with NH2NH2 were investigated in details during the liquid phase FFR hydrogenation. The Ni-B amorphous alloy catalyst exhibited much higher activity and better selectivity to FFA than the Ni powder catalyst, showing the promoting effect of the alloying B on both the activity and selectivity to FFA which could be understood by considering both the structural effect and electronic effect. Briefly, concerning the structural effect, the presence of the alloying B resulted in the amorphous alloy in the Ni-B catalyst while only the crystalline structure was obtained without the alloying B, as determined in the Ni powder catalyst. It has been widely accepted that such amorphous alloy structure was favorable for both the activity and selectivity and even the sulfur resistance in many hydrogenation reactions owing to the stronger synergistic effect between active sites, the more highly unsaturated active sites, and the more homogeneous distribution of these active sites [13,26]. Regarding the electronic effect, the XPS spectra revealed that there was strong electronic interaction between metallic Ni and the alloying B, in which the alloying B donated partial electrons to metallic Ni, making Ni electron-enriched, just similar to the metallic Fe in the present Ni-Fe-B amorphous alloy catalyst. Thus, the promoting effect of the alloying B could be explained in the similar way to that of the metallic Fe as discussed above. 4 Conclusions At suitable content of the Fe-dopant (χFe), the Fe-doped Ni-B amorphous alloy catalyst exhibited higher activity and better selectivity to FFA during the liquid phase FFR hydrogenation. The optimum χFe was determined as 0.51. The promoting effect of the Fe-dopant on the selectivity to FFA could be mainly attributed to the activation of the CO bond by both the electron-deficient Fe and the Fe3+. Meanwhile, the electron-enrichment of the Ni active sites could also weaken the CO bond by a back donation of electrons to the antibonding orbital (2π∗) of the carbonyl group. Such electronic effect, together with the dispersing effect of the Fe2O3, could also explain the promotion of the Fe-dopant on the hydrogenation activity. Very low content of the Fe-dopant (χ Fe<0.11) was harmful for the selectivity to FFA because the isolated Fe atoms existed in the Ni lattice so active that both the carbonyl group and the furan ring could be hydrogenated. Meanwhile, very high content of the Fe-dopant (χ Fe>0.51) was harmful for the activity because too many Ni active sites are covered by the inactive Fe and Fe2O3 species. The maximum FFA yield (100%) could be obtained over the Ni-Fe-B amorphous alloy catalyst with χ Fe=0.51 after reaction for 4h under the present conditions.
