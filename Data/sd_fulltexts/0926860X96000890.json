Burch *, P.K. Loader Catalysis Research Centre, Chemisto' Department, The Unicersi~' of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 6AD, UK Received 20 December 1995; revised 13 February 1996; accepted 13 February 1996 Abstract The nature and properties of zirconia-supported rhodium catalysts after high temperature treatment in an oxidising atmosphere have been studied. No interaction between the metal and the support is seen even after calcination at 700, easily reduced rhodium oxide being the only Rh species present. Higher dispersion of this species can be achieved by using a higher surface area alumina-doped ZrO2 although it is necessary to pre-sinter the support to prevent encapsulation of the Rh. Rh/ZrO2 catalysts calcined at 500 have remarkably high activity for methane combustion, similar to that of a Pd/A1203 catalyst calcined at the same temperature. Whilst the use of zirconia is preferable to alumina for combustion reactions, the activity of the zirconia-sup- ported Rh in the selective reduction of NO with propene under lean-burn conditions is less than was found previously for Rh/AI203. This can be attributed to a lack of isolated Rh3+ ions in the Rh/ZrO2 catalysts. Attempts have been made to inhibit the deactivation reaction of rhodium oxide with A1203 by pretreatment of the AI203 with Zr-containing precursors. The extent to which the Zr modifies the surface properties of the support are discussed. Keywords: Rhodium; Zirconia; Combustion; Lean-burn conditions; DeNOx catalysts 1. Introduction It is well known [1-3] that there is a large decrease in the amount of surface rhodium present in Rh/A1203 catalysts after treatment at high temperature in an oxidising atmosphere. This is due to a strong interaction between Rh203 and the support, and can lead to severe catalyst deactivation. In contrast to this, no such interaction has been found with zirconia [4-6]. Some use of this observation has * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PH S0926- 860X(96)00089-0 318 R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996)317-335 been made in the design of automotive catalysts. For example, zirconia has been introduced, along with ceria, to the alumina washcoat layer supporting the Rh in order to form Rh-O-Zr bonds rather than the detrimental rhodium-alumina interaction [7,8]. A further patent [9] shows the use of a stabilised zirconia washcoat layer for supporting the rhodium. However, due to its low surface area (ca. 5 m2 g-1) after calcination at > 800 [10], the use of zirconia as a support has been limited. In many automotive catalyst formulations, zirconia is used simply as an additive to stabilise alumina or, in a solid solution with ceria, as an oxygen storage component. A more detailed study of the oxygen storage properties of the Rh/ZrOz-CeOz system has recently been published [11]. Over the last two or three years new preparation methods have led to the production of zirconias with surface areas up to 30 m2 g-1 after calcination at 700 [10,12]. Doping the zirconia with La, Si, or sulphate gives surface areas up to 100 m2 g 1 after this treatment. In the light of this, there is now growing interest in using zirconia as a support in emission control catalysts. It is therefore of interest to study the effect of using zirconia in rhodium catalysts, not only as a support in its own right, but also as a barrier to prevent the rhodium-alumina interaction. This paper presents the results of a study of Rh supported on both pure and stabilised zirconia as well as zirconia-impregnated alumina. Results previously obtained using alumina as a support [13] will be used for comparison, as will alumina- and zirconia-supported palladium. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Three different supports were used for the rhodium, namely 20 wt.-% Zr/AI203, ZrO2, and AlzO3-stabilised ZrO2 (containing 10-15% A1203 by weight). In the text and Figures these supports will be abbreviated as Zr/A1, Zr, and Zr-A1, respectively. The zirconia samples were supplied as the hydroxide by MEL Chemicals. The 20% Zr/AI203 was prepared by impregnating 2~-A1203 (Azko Chemie CK 300) with a solution of zirconium acetate in acetic acid (Aldrich) followed by drying at 120. All the supports were calcined at 500 for 2 h or at 700 for 16 h prior to introducing the active metal component. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness using rhodium(III) nitrate solution (Johnson Matthey) to give 1 or 0.1% Rh by weight. The precursors were dried at 120 followed by calcination in air for 16 h at either 500 or 700. 1% Pd catalysts supported on pure alumina and zirconia were prepared in the same manner, using palladium(II) nitrate (Johnson Matthey), and calcined for 16 h at 500. R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 317-335 319 In the text to follow the different series of catalysts will be referred to as Rh/support, e.g. Rh/Zr-A1 for samples supported on the alumina-stabilised zirconia. In addition, individual catalysts will be denoted according to the calcination temperature of the rhodium and the temperature at which the support was calcined before addition of the rhodium. Thus, Rh(500)/(Zr/A1)(700) refers to the sample in which the 20% Zr/A1203 support was precalcined at 700, and the rhodium calcined at 500. 2.2. Catalyst characterization Due to the low metal loading, it was not possible to characterise the 0.1% Rh catalysts. Therefore, the following applies only to 1% Rh samples. The total surface areas of the supports and catalysts were determined by the BET method using the adsorption of N2 at - 196 in a static vacuum system. The sample (100 mg) was outgassed at 200 for 1 h and cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Data were obtained by dosing nitrogen on the sample in 80 Torr steps between 80 and 400 Torr and measuring the pressure before and after exposure to the sample. Information on the phases of zirconia present in the samples was obtained using X-ray diffraction. The data were collected on an INEL 3000 X-ray diffractometer using monochromatic Cu K c~ radiation. Temperature programmed reduction was used to characterise the catalysts. The sample (50 rag) was heated at 5 min-~ between room temperature and 750 in flowing 5% Hz/Ar (10 cm3 min- 1). The exit gas from the reactor was passed through a dry-ice trap and the hydrogen uptake measured by a TCD. Chemisorption of H2 on the metal in the various catalysts was measured on the same apparatus as mentioned above. The sample (100 mg) was outgassed at 200 and then reduced at 300 for 30 min in ca. 0.8 atm H2. Following further outgassing at this temperature the sample was cooled to room tempera- ture and the H2 chemisorption measured by dosing H2 in 1 Torr steps between 1 and 10 Torr. The reduction temperature used for the chemisorption experiments (300) was chosen in order to avoid sintering of the metals during the reduction step. However, as will be seen from the TPR data, this temperature is not always sufficient to reduce all the rhodium in some of the samples. In these cases it is not valid to use H/M ratios or to discuss metal dispersion since not all the rhodium will be present as the metal. In view of this, chemisorption results (shown in Table 1) are expressed in terms of the amount of hydrogen taken up per gram of sample. 2.3. Catalyst testing The catalysts were tested for the combustion of methane and the reduction of NO with propene, both in excess oxygen. 320 R. Burch, P.K. Loader~Applied Catalysis A.\" General 143 (1996) 317-335 Methane combustion was studied over 100 mg of catalyst between 300 and 500 in 1% CH4/air with a total flow rate of 100 cm3 min-~. Analysis of products was performed by gas chromatography using an FID fitted with a methanator catalyst to allow the detection of CO2. The NO reduction was carried out using a gas mix containing 500 ppm NO, 1000 ppm C3H6, 5% 02, with balance He to give a total flow of 200 cm3 min-~. The catalyst (100 mg) was heated between room temperature and 500 and samples taken at intervals within this range. NO and NO~. concentrations were measured using chemiluminescence. No attempt was made to detect N20. 3. Results 3.1. ZrO2-supported catalysts Results obtained from chemisorption, BET and XRD experiments are shown in Table 1.

TPR traces of 1% Rh/ZrO2 catalysts. 321 calcination at 500 or 700 leads to the formation of a little of the monoclinic phase. These treatments also cause a decrease in the total surface area, this effect being greater after calcination of the rhodium at 700. Calcination of the bare support at 700 leads to the formation of a larger proportion of the monoclinic phase with a consequent greater decrease in surface area. Addition of rhodium and calcination gives catalysts which contain only the monoclinic phase of zirconia. The BET surface area of these catalysts was not measured since the low area of the support (3 m2 g- l) is at the limit of our experimental set up and any further loss of surface area could not be determined accurately. The results of H2 chemisorption experiments (Table 1) and TPR data (Fig. 1) on the Rh/Zr catalysts show that the pretreatment of the support has little effect on catalysts calcined at 500. Thus, the hydrogen uptake for these two samples is similar as are the TPR profiles, both of which show two reduction peaks between 100 and 250 corresponding to easily reduced rhodium oxide. For catalysts calcined at 700, however, the support calcination temperature does make a difference. The H2 uptake is seen to be higher when the support has been calcined at 700, and is also greater than that seen for an alumina- supported catalyst calcined at the same temperature (Table 1). In addition, the sample for which both the support and catalyst have been calcined at 700 shows only one sharp reduction peak centred at 150, whereas the correspond- ing sample on the support calcined at 500 shows only a small broad feature between 200 and 320, indicating a lack of easily reduced rhodium oxide. The results of CH4 combustion experiments on these catalysts are shown in Fig. 2a. It is clear that the sample with the lowest H2 uptake and smallest 322 R. Burch, P.K.

In addition, for a given catalyst calcination temperature, the samples for which the support had been pre-treated at the higher temperature are more active. For the catalysts calcined at 500 this is the case despite the catalysts R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 317-335 323 having similar chemisorption and reduction characteristics. It is also of note that the activity of these samples is higher than that seen previously [13] for alumina-supported catalysts calcined at the same temperature. Fig. 2b shows results for CH4 combustion over 0.1% Rh catalysts supported on zirconia calcined at 700. As expected, the activity of these samples is lower than for the 1% Rh catalysts, the sample calcined at 700 having a very low activity. Results obtained for the 1% Rh samples in the NO reduction reaction are shown in Fig. 3a. The temperature of the maximum amount of reduction of NO to N2 follows the same trend as the activity for the methane combustion reaction, and presumably, therefore, the trend in the activity for propene combustion. It is also of note that, broadly speaking, the maximum conversion of NO to N2 decreases as the temperature of this maximum increases. The activity of these catalysts for the selective reduction is lower than that seen previously for alumina-supported Rh [13]. A similar trend is seen for 0.1% Rh samples (Fig. 3b), the activity again being lower than for the 1% Rh samples. 3.2. ZrOz-Alz 03-supported catalysts This support is a stabilised zirconia containing between 10 and 15 wt.-% alumina. XRD data (Table 1) shows that calcination of this material at 500 gives cubic zirconia. The catalysts made using this material also contain only this phase, unlike the pure zirconia on which some of the monoclinic phase was seen. When the A1-Zr support is calcined at 700 the monoclinic phase does appear. Catalysts made using this material contain both cubic and monoclinic zirconia, again in contrast to the Rh/Zr system in which only the monoclinic phase was seen on the corresponding samples. No peaks corresponding to alumina were seen on any of the Zr-A1 samples indicating that it is well dispersed. It is clear that the presence of the alumina retards the phase change resulting in the formation of the monoclinic phase. As a consequence of this, the surface areas of all the samples are higher than for pure zirconia, e.g. 42 m2 g- as opposed to 3 m2 g- ~ for the pure zirconia after calcination of the support at 700. Chemisorption results (Table 1) show that the H2 uptake is greater for the Rh/Zr-A1 samples than for the Rh/Zr catalysts. Again the lowest uptake is seen for the sample on which the rhodium is calcined at 700 on a support calcined at 500. The most interesting result is that seen for the sample for which both the support and catalyst are calcined at 700. In this case the H2 uptake is far higher than seen for any other catalyst calcined at this temperature, both in this study and previously for alumina-supported rhodium [13]. Fig. 4 shows the TPR traces for the Rh/Zr-A1 catalysts. As with the Rh/Zr samples, the catalyst with the lowest H2 uptake shows no low temperature reduction and thus contains no easily reduced rhodium oxide. Both the samples for which the support was pre-calcined at 700 do have low temperature peaks, 40 R. Burch, P.K.

TPR traces of 1% Rh/ZrO2-A1203 catalysts. two mentioned previously, shows only a broad reduction feature starting at 100, as opposed to definite peaks. Fig. 5a shows the results for CH4 combustion over these samples. As for the Rh/Zr samples, the lowest activity is seen for the catalyst with the smallest H2 uptake. However, by far the most active catalyst is that for which both support and metal have been calcined at 700. This is despite the fact that the H2 uptake seen for this catalyst is similar to, or less than, that for the two samples calcined at 500. A similar trend in activity is not seen for 0.1% Rh catalysts (Fig. 5b). Here, the catalysts calcined at 500 are more active than those calcined at 700, and for a given catalyst calcination temperature pre-treating the support at a higher temperature gives higher activity. Results of the NO reduction experiments are shown in Fig. 6. For both the 1% Rh (Fig. 6a) and 0.1% Rh (Fig. 6b) catalysts the same general trends are seen, these being similar to those seen for the Rh/Zr system. It is also of note that the activity of the Rh/Zr-A1 samples for NO reduction to N2 is higher than for Rh/Zr samples, although they are not as active as when alumina is used as the support [13]. 3.3. 20% Zr / AleO3-supported catalysts XRD data (Table 1) show that after calcination at 500 no crystalline zirconia is present on the support, indicating that the Zr is dispersed over the alumina. After calcination at 700, however, some cubic zirconia is seen. From line broadening, this zirconia is present as particles with an average size of ca. (a) R. Burch, P.K.

The amount of Hz uptake (Table 1) seen for the catalysts calcined at 500 is the highest seen for any samples studied. The values for the 700 calcined samples are less affected by support calcination temperature than were the two sets of zirconia-supported catalysts, the values again being higher than were seen for alumina-supported samples [13]. TPR traces for these samples are shown in Fig. 7. Unlike the zirconia-sup- ported samples, no low temperature peaks are seen. Instead, the 500 calcined samples show broad features starting at 100 with a peak at 300. For samples calcined at 700 only the peak at 300 is seen. The results are more indicative of those seen in earlier work on alumina-supported Rh catalysts [13] than of the zirconia-supported samples reported in this work. The CH4 combustion data (Fig. 8) for these catalysts are also similar to those seen for Rh/A1203 [13]. Thus, the catalysts calcined at 500 are both better than those calcined at 700. Calcining the support at 700 as opposed to 500 gives catalysts with slightly better activity. Fig. 9a shows results of the NO reduction reaction over catalysts for which the support was calcined at 700. In this case, both samples have the same maximum conversion of NO to N2 despite the fact that the sample calcined at 700 has far lower activity for CH4 combustion. This behaviour is similar to that seen previously for Rh/AlzO3 [13], although the maximum conversion of NO to N2 is less (45% vS. 75%). A further feature seen on Rh/A1203 catalysts was that the activity for the NO to Nz reaction decreased after treating the R. Burch, P.K.

Fig. 9b shows results for the Rh/(Zr/A1) catalysts after this treatment. It is clear (compare Fig. 9a and b) that the sample calcined at 500 is unchanged. However, that calcined at 700 has lost almost half its activity for the reduction of NO to N2. In this regard, the latter sample is acting like the alumina-supported samples, whereas the catalyst calcined at 500 is behaving like the zirconia-supported samples, none of which were affected by exposure to the reaction mixture at 500. The maximum conversion of NO to N2 is still less than was seen for the Rh/A1203 system [13], but greater than for the zirconia-supported catalysts reported here. 4. Discussion 4.1. Zirconia-supported catalysts With one exception in each case, the catalysts supported on pure and doped zirconia display low temperature reduction features in their TPR traces, indicat- ing the presence of easily reduced rhodium oxide on these samples after calcination at 500 and 700. A similar result was only seen with alumina-sup- ported catalysts [13] for a sample calcined at 300 which was prepared specifically to avoid any support interaction. This suggests that, as was previ- ously found [4], there is no interaction between the rhodium and the zirconia support. The exception to this is for catalysts in which the support was calcined 330 R. Burch, P.K.

Table 1 shows that for both these samples there is a large decrease in BET surface area during the catalyst calcination step. In the case of pure zirconia this is also accompanied by R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 317-335 331 a phase change. It is likely, therefore, that on these samples the rhodium becomes encapsulated during the collapse of the zirconia. Similar effects have been seen on alumina-supported catalysts [14] when high temperature treatments leading to the formation of the low surface area o~-A1203 are employed. The encapsulation of rhodium by zirconia would also explain the low H2 uptake and catalytic activity seen for these samples. It can be seen from Table 1 that for samples in which the rhodium is not encapsulated by the support, the H2 uptake is higher on Rh/Zr-A1 samples than Rh/Zr samples for a given set of calcination treatments. This is despite the fact that a greater percentage of the rhodium is reducible below 300 for the Rh/Zr samples (compare Figs. 1 and 4). It may also be seen from the TPR traces that for the Rh/Zr samples the reduction peaks seen below 300 are at a higher temperature than those seen on the Rh/Zr-A1 catalysts. It has previously been found [15] that on zirconia larger rhodium oxide particles are harder to reduce. These results indicate that the reducible rhodium is better dispersed in Rh/Zr-Al samples than Rh/Zr. This is likely to be a consequence of the higher surface area of the Zr-A1 support, on which the rhodium particles will be more spread out and thus less likely to coalesce to form larger particles during high temperature oxidation. Whilst it is clear that in order to obtain the reducible rhodium in a more dispersed form it is necessary to use a higher surface area support, it must also be noted that it is important to stabilise the surface area of a given support by high temperature calcination before addition of the rhodium. For example, high H2 uptake is seen for the Rh(700)/Zr-AI(700) catalyst even though TPR (Fig. 4) shows that not all of the metal will be reduced at 300. When the support is calcined at 500 prior to calcining the catalyst at 700, encapsulation of the rhodium occurs and the H2 uptake is low. For samples which contain easily reducible rhodium oxide on the surface with little or no interaction with the support, one would expect high activity for the CH4 combustion reaction, as was seen for the Rh/A1203 catalyst calcined at 300 [13]. This is seen to be the case (Fig. 2a and 5a) and is further illustrated in Fig. 10 which compares the activity of zirconia and alumina-supported Rh and Pd catalysts calcined at 500. It is clear from the Figure that when using pre-sintered zirconia as the support, rhodium has a similar activity to Pd supported on alumina or zirconia. This is surprising, since Pd catalysts are considered to be the best for CH4 combustion in oxygen rich atmospheres. It is of further note (results not shown) that for the Rh/Zr-A1 system, a similar high activity is seen even after calcination of the rhodium at 700, a treatment which leads to severe deactivation for this reaction on Rh/A1203 [13]. The activity of all the Rh/Zr and Rh/Zr-AI catalysts for the selective reduction of NO to N2 is less than was seen for Rh/A1203 [13]. In general, the rhodium species which best activate methane are also the most efficient for selective reduction of NO. This is in contrast to Rh/AI203 where the sample 332 R. Burch, P.K.

(+) Rh/ZrO2(700); ( ) Rh/Al203; (X) Pd/ZrO2(700); ( zx ) Pd/AI203. with the highest activity for methane combustion was the least efficient for selective NO reduction. It was concluded [13] that for this reaction the most active species on these catalysts was isolated Rh3+ ions formed by a strong interaction between rhodium oxide and alumina, as opposed to easily reduced rhodium oxide. The absence of the highly selective Rh3 + ions on the Rh/Zr and Rh/Zr-A1 catalysts reported here may explain the observed trends. The results obtained for 0.1% Rh/Zr-A1 catalysts show similar trends for both CH4 combustion and NO reduction. Thus, the catalysts calcined at 500 are both more active than those calcined at 700, whilst calcining the support at a higher temperature leads to more active catalysts. It is of note that the CH4 combustion activity of 700 calcined 0.1% Rh samples supported on both zirconias is no greater than corresponding Rh/AI203 samples [13], whilst those calcined at 500 do give better results than their AlzO3-supported analogues. This is in contrast to the results seen for the 1% Rh samples. It is possible for the 0.1% Rh samples that during the high temperature calcination the Rh becomes trapped in defect sites on the zirconia surface and thus loses its activity. The similar loss of activity for Rh/A1203 samples is believed [13] to be due to a strong, interaction of rhodium with the alumina surface. 4.2. Rh / (20% Zr/Ale 03) catalysts These catalysts were prepared in an attempt to prevent the rhodium-alumina interaction by depositing a layer of zirconia on the alumina surface prior to R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 317-335 333 introduction of the rhodium. The results obtained show that the catalytic properties are more in keeping with those seen for the Rh/AI203 system [13] than the Rh/Zr and Rh/Zr-A1 catalysts reported here, i.e. low CH4 combustion activity, and high selectivity for NO reduction to N2. This suggests that the zirconia is not forming a complete monolayer on the alumina surface (a fact borne out by the presence of some large particles of crystalline ZrO:, as seen by XRD) and that Rh-A1203 interactions are still occurring. However, as will be discussed, there is evidence that this interaction is not as strong as in the Rh/A1203 system. The TPR traces (Fig. 7) show that the rhodium is not present as easily reduced rhodium oxide since there are no low temperature peaks. Where reduction is seen to occur below 300 it appears as a broad feature. However, the H2 uptake seen for these catalyst is higher than that for Rh/AI203 samples (Table 1) and, for catalysts calcined at 500, higher than the zirconia-supported systems. Thus, it seems possible that for catalysts calcined at 500 the Rh is present as small dispersed clusters (giving the high Ha uptake) which have some interaction with the alumina, and are thus not easily reducible, although this interaction is less extensive than seen for Rh/AI:O3. For catalysts calcined at 700 a strong Rh-alumina interaction still appears to exist. The low combustion activity seen for these catalysts (Fig. 8) confirms the lack of easily reducible rhodium oxide. However, the catalysts are not as active as was found for Rh/A1203 [13] for the reduction of NO to N2. As was mentioned earlier, the most active sites for NO reduction on alumina-supported catalysts are believed to be isolated Rh3+ ions in the surface of the alumina [13]. It appears that the concentration of these species is lower on the Rh/(Zr/A1) catalysts reported here, again suggesting that the interaction of Rh with the alumina is less extensive in this case. It was also found previously for Rh/AI203 catalysts [13] that exposure to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 500 led to a loss of activity for the reduction of NO to N2. This is believed to be due to the removal of the isolated Rh3 + species by a partial reduction which leads to the formation of more easily reduced rhodium oxide species. For the Rh/(Zr/A1) catalysts calcined at 500 there may be no isolated Rh3+ present at all since exposure to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 500 had no effect on activity (compare Fig. 9a and b). Such a loss of activity was, however, seen for the catalyst calcined at 700 indicating the presence of isolated Rh3+ on these samples. It appears, therefore, that whilst a metal-support interaction is occurring in the Rh/(Zr/A1) samples calcined at 500, this interaction is not sufficiently strong to lead to the incorporation of Rh3 + ions into the alumina surface. This may be due to partial covering of alumina by Zr, this being sufficient to retard the rhodium-alumina interaction at this temperature. However, catalysts cal- cined at 700 do appear to contain Rh3 + ions in the alumina surface, although not in the same concentration as on corresponding Rh/AI203 samples. At the 334 R. Burch, P.K. Loader/Applied Catalysis A: General 143 (1996) 317-335 higher calcination temperature the Rh may be sufficiently mobile to interact further with the alumina, despite the presence of Zr. From the above, it may be concluded that the Rh/(Zr/AI) catalysts contain rhodium whose interaction with alumina is modified by the presence of zirconia. This effect is similar whatever the calcination temperature of the support suggesting that the formation of large ZrO2 particles is not significant, there being enough Zr dispersed over the alumina to modify its interaction with the rhodium. The resulting partially interacted rhodium may be responsible for the reduction peak at 300 seen in the TPR profiles of these samples. As a final point it must be noted that whilst the addition of zirconium to the alumina does decrease the interaction between the rhodium and alumina, this change is not beneficial to the activity of the catalyst either for CH4 combustion or NO reduction. Further investigations are therefore necessary in order to find a preparation method which will allow a monolayer of zirconia to be deposited on the alumina. 5. Conclusions The use of zirconia as a support for rhodium gives catalysts which contain easily reduced rhodium oxide. The best results are obtained using a higher surface area support which has been pre-sintered to stabilise the surface area. Thus, even after calcination at 700, Rh supported on ZrO2-A1203 has a similar total activity for CH4 combustion as does Pd/A1203, and is far more active than the corresponding Rh/AI203 catalyst. However, whilst the use of zirconia is beneficial for combustion reactions, it gives catalysts which are less selective for NO reduction than Rh/A1203. The addition of 20% Zr to A1203 modifies, but does not prevent, the Rh-alumina interaction. The catalytic activity of the resultant samples is inferior to Rh/A1203 for both CH4 combustion and NO reduction.
