The reduced Nio.osMgo.970 catalyst showed higher activity and much higher stability than a commercial reforming catalyst (Ni/AIzO3-MgO). The content of metallic nickel on the catalyst surface reduced by hydrogen was only 0.17 /zmol/m2 and the turnover frequency of the methane-steam reaction at 1023 K was 62 s 1. The catalyst kept its activity for 60 h or more at 1123 K and a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0, giving little coke on the catalyst (< 1 wt.-%), whereas the commercial steam reforming catalyst lost its activity at 20 h because of severe coking under the same reaction conditions. For both Nio.03Mg0.g70 and Ni/AlzOs-MgO, the rate equations were similar. Thus it was suggested that the suppressed coke formation of our catalyst is caused by the very small nickel particles and the difference in the composition of surface carbonaceous species on the Ni metal particles as the reaction intermediate.

Yamazaki et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 49-56 number of studies on this reaction have been done [2-9]. In these reports reactions were conducted under conditions where the steam to carbon ratio in the feed gas was in the range of 1.9-9.0. This is because the coke formation, which destroys the catalyst structure and kills its activity, is thermodynamically favored at 910 K, under atmospheric pressure and a steam to carbon ratio less than 1.4 [6]. At high reaction temperature the carbon formation occurs between the domain of the nickel crystal and the metal-support interface, liberating small particles of nickel from the support surface while leaving large amounts of fibrous carbon and destroyed catalyst [10]. Therefore, the industrial methane- steam reaction is usually run under a steam to carbon ratio of 1.4 or higher, to maintain the catalyst activity. CH4 + H20 = 3H2 + CO (1) H20 + CO = CO2 + H2 (2) However, from the industrial point of view, it is quite attractive to operate the reaction under low steam/carbon conditions because the H2/CO ratio in the product under low steam/carbon is high (close to 3/1) while the formation of CO2 as by-product of the water-gas shift reaction (Eq. 2) is kept at a low level and also, the energy consumption to vaporize water and heat it up to the reaction temperature is minimized. The problem is, however, the severe deactivation of the catalyst due to the formation of fibrous carbon [10] formed on the interface of Ni metal particles and the support. Some researchers succeeded in suppress- ing the coke formation by adding MgO to the Ni/A1203 catalyst and this kind of catalyst has been used industrially [3,8]. Still, for the Ni/MgO-AI203 catalyst it has not been reported that it can be used practically under a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0. It is well known that the formation of a NiO-MgO solid solution is easily favored by calcining the mixed oxide at high temperatures [11] and much attention was paid to its specific properties [3,12-14]. Parmaliana et al. [13] reported that their Ni (17.9 wt.-%)/MgO catalyst which was calcined above 1073 K showed little activity for the steam reforming reaction. This was because Ni2+ in the solid solution is hard to reduce due to the formation of a solid solution. Borowiecki [3] also reported that the formation of NiO-MgO solid solution in the NiO-MgO-A1203 system was favored by calcination at 873 K and then the amount of the active nickel metal of the reduced catalyst decreased, resulting in lower catalytic activity. Recently, the present authors found that a Ni-Mg-O catalyst, which was prepared by reducing a solid solution of NiO-MgO with low NiO concentration at high temperature, showed a high activity and especially excellent stability for methane-CO2 reforming and little coke was formed during the reaction even if the feed gas composition was CO2/CH4 = 1 [15,16]. In this communication, we reported that a pure NiO-MgO solid solution catalyst which contains a small amount of NiO ( < 3 mol-%) showed a practical O.

Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Catalyst preparation was similar to the method which has been reported previously [15,16]. A mixed aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate and nickel acetate (in total 1 M) was heated up to 330 K and an equimolar amount of potassium carbonate was added as an aqueous solution (2 M) to coprecipitate the carbonates of magnesium and nickel. After filtering the precipitate was rinsed with hot water repeatedly, a considerable amount of diluted (NH4)HCO3 aqueous solution (0.1 M) was used to remove the potassium ions completely. After drying at 393 K for 12 h, the catalyst precursor was calcined at 1223 K for 20 h in air in order to make a solid solution. The composition of the Ni-Mg-O catalyst indicated as Nio.o3Mgo.970 was determined to be Nio.o32Mgo.9680 by means of flame emission spectroscopy (EFS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1) of the catalyst exhibited a single phase showing that a solid solution was formed. The calcined powder was pressed into disks and ground to 20/40 mesh. The surface area of Nio.o3Mg0.970 was determined to be 18 mZ/g using the BET method. The catalyst was reduced in hydrogen flow under atmospheric pressure at 1073 K for 3 min in situ before the reaction. Commer- C 42.0 I NiomMgo~O MgO ,/4( .

Apparatus and reaction condition Reactions were performed with a conventional fixed bed reactor. Reaction temperature was controlled and monitored with a thermocouple protected by a quartz thermo-well inserted in the center of the catalyst bed. Commercially available methane (purity > 99.9%) was used without further purification. Deionized water was continuously fed by a microfeeder into the preheater up-flow of the reactor. The amount of catalyst was 150 mg. The mole ratio of H20 and CH4 in the feed was 1.0, total flow rate: 50 ml/min, W/F: 1.2 g h mo1-1 (GHSV = 20000 h 1), reaction temperature: 1123 K, and total pressure: 0.1 MPa. The effluent gas was cooled to remove water and then analyzed by a gas chromatograph (molecular sieve 5A and Propak Q column) with a TCD and a FID detector. Catalyst activity was evaluated by methane conversion (Eq. 3) in which coke formation was ignored since the amount of coke was negligible on the Ni-Mg-O solid solution catalyst.

Effect of reduction temperature Fig. 2 shows the effect of reduction temperature on the catalytic activity for methane-steam reforming on the Ni0.03Mg0.970 catalyst at 873 K. Catalytic activity suddenly appeared when the catalyst was reduced at 1073 K; it increased somewhat with reduction at temperatures higher than 1073 K. The catalytic activity of the catalyst reduced for 45 min was almost the same as that of 3 min reduction. This temperature is consistent with the reduction tempera- ture of Ni2+ in Ni-Mg-O solid solution reported before [17]. From these results, one may conclude that the activity is caused by the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni From XRD measurement, the peak attributed to Ni metal was not observed. However the oxygen adsorption at room temperature and via 873 K suggested that 1.5% of Ni in the catalyst was reduced to Niand the dispersion of the nickel particle was 14%. This indicates that the size of the Ni metal particle formed by the reduction was very small (less than 3-4 nm). O.

Catalyst actiuity and life In Fig. 3 are shown the activity change on Nio.03Mg0.970 and commercial Ni/AIzO3-MgO catalyst under standard conditions, while the product gas compositions are shown in Table 1. While the Ni/AlzO3-MgO showed good stability and activity for more than 40 h under a steam to carbon ratio of 2.0, it lost its activity and structure and the reactor was plugged due to the considerable amount of coke (ca. 104 wt.-%-carbon/g-cat, after 20 h) under a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0. On the other hand, the Nio.o3Mgo.970 catalyst exhibited excellent activity (90% as methane conversion) which was close to the equilib- rium (95%) and the activity was maintained for over 70 h even under a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0. Little increase of the catalyst weight ( < 1.0 wt.-%) after the reaction was observed, and the catalytic activity was constant over 65 h. These phenomena indicate that the coke formation and the deactivation did not occur on Nio.o3Mgo.g70 catalyst. While the concentration of carbon dioxide of Ni/AlzO3-MgO was 9.5% under a steam to carbon ratio of 2.0, that of Nio.o3Mgo.970 was only 2.0%. The H2/CO ratio in the product gas was also close to the stoichiometric ratio (= 3.0) as expected from Eq. 1. Bartholomew [7] showed that, from the thermodynamic calculations, a con- siderable amount of coke, either amorphous or graphitic carbon, can be formed from the gas phase when the conversion was at equilibrium and the steam to carbon ratio was 0.1-2.0. Our result that no coke formation was observed under 54 O.

In order to understand this inconsistency, reaction kinetics on Nio.o3Mgo.970 catalyst (Fig. 4) and Ni/AlzO3-MgO was investigated at 1023 K. The data were obtained by measuring the catalytic activity at 0 h and 0.5 h.

It is apparent that reaction orders, with respect to either CH4 or H20 are quite similar for the two catalysts. It was suggested that the rate of the elementary step involved in HzO was much faster than that involved in methane for either catalyst. If the methane-steam reaction is assumed to be comprised of the following two reactions as in Eqs. 6 and 7, rate equations suggest that the rate with which steam oxidizes the carbonaceous species on the Ni surface formed by methane decomposition is much faster than that of its formation (Eq. 6). The differences in the rate equation or the characteristic features of the reaction cannot suggest us the reason for the great differences in the carbon formation on the two catalysts. Therefore, the difference of the structure of the carbon species on the Ni surface seems to be important. In order to understand the reaction intermediate and more precise mechanisms for reaction or coke formation of methane-steam reaction on Nio.o3Mg0.970, further investigations are necessary. 4-x) CH4 + Ni ~ CHx-Ni + ~ H2 (6) 56 O.

Conclusion Steam reforming of methane with a feed gas of a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0 was successfully conducted without catalyst deactivation by using a Ni-Mg-O solid solution with low Ni content. Although it has been reported that the NiO-MgO solid solution shows little activity for the title reaction, the Ni0.03Mg0.g70 catalyst reduced at high temperature (> 1073 K) showed higher activity and more excellent stability than the commercially available reforming catalyst while the rate equation was quite similar. Under these conditions, low CO2 formation was achieved at the same time. Actually little deposited coke ( < 1.0 wt.-%) was formed on this catalyst over 65 h of run with a feed gas of steam to carbon ratio of 1.0. References [1] W.W. Akers and D.P.

        "dc:description": "A NiMgO solid solution with low Ni content (Ni0.03Mg0.97O, atomic ratio) which was reduced at high temperature (> 1073 K) was found to be an active and stable catalyst for the steam reforming of methane in a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0. The reduced Ni0.03Mg0.97O catalyst showed higher activity and much higher stability than a commercial reforming catalyst (Ni/Al2O3MgO). The content of metallic nickel on the catalyst surface reduced by hydrogen was only 0.17 μmol/m2 and the turnover frequency of the methane-steam reaction at 1023 K was 62 s−1. The catalyst kept its activity for 60 h or more at 1123 K and a steam to carbon ratio of 1.0, giving little coke on the catalyst (<1 wt.-%), whereas the commercial steam reforming catalyst lost its activity at 20 h because of severe coking under the same reaction conditions. For both Ni0.03Mg0.97O and Ni/Al2O3MgO, the rate equations were similar. Thus it was suggested that the suppressed coke formation of our catalyst is caused by the very small nickel particles and the difference in the composition of surface carbonaceous species on the Ni metal particles as the reaction intermediate.",
