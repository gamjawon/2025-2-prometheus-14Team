Kinetics of Claisen-Schmidt condensation, intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone and synthesis of chalcone Alain Guida, Mohammed Hassane Lhouty, Didier Tichit*, Francois Figueras1, Patrick Geneste Laboratoire des Mat~riaux Catalytiques et Catalyse en Chimie Organique, UMR 5618 ENSCM/CNRS, 8 rue de l'Ecole Normale, 34296 Montpellier Cedex 05, France Received 3 March 1997; received in revised form 6 May 1997; accepted 6 May 1997 Abstract The activity of hydrotalcites has been investigated by means of several reactions able to evidence their basic properties and the mechanism involved, and also to show their interest in the synthesis of fine chemicals of great practical interest for pharmaceutical applications. With this aim, the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde with excess acetone has been performed in solid-liquid conditions. The kinetic study suggests a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the rate- determining step would be the condensation of benzaldehyde and acetone, in agreement with former results of Hammett correlations. The reaction rate goes through a maximum as a function of calcination temperature of the catalyst, or the water content of the solvent, suggesting that the active sites are basic hydroxyls. These results are obtained by the intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone as test reaction giving selectively 3-methyl-2-cyclopentanone, and showing, indeed, the presence of mainly basic sites on the hydrotalcite. Taking these results into account, the synthesis of chalcone has been performed over a suitably activated hydrotalcite. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Hydrotalcites are magnesium-aluminium-hydroxy- carbonates with a lamellar structure and general for- mula: 2+ 3+ 2- (Mgt-xAlx (OH)2)(CO3)x/2 \" nH20. Some of the Mg2+ are isomorphously replaced by A13+ and these substitutions produce layers with an excess of positive charges which are compensated by carbonate *Corresponding author.

PII S0926-860X(97)00 1 75-0 anions located, as water molecules, in the interlayer space [1,2]. Therefore, hydrotalcites have anionic exchange capacity. Calcined hydrotalcites are poten- tially useful as catalysts since they decompose rever- sibly at high temperature to form high surface area mixed oxides which present basic sites and are stable to steam treatment [3]. It appears that the active surface sites include structural hydroxyls as well as O2--Mn+ acid-base pairs [4]. These catalysts found many applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals: f3-propiolactone and olefinic oxide polymerisation [5,6], aldol [7-12] and Knoevenagel condensations 252 A. Guida et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 251-264 [13-15], double bond migration [3,7], aromatisation [16], alkylation of ketones [17], epoxydation of alkenes [18], cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds and nucleophilic ring opening of oxiranes [19]. Many of these reactions are known to be performed over either basic or acid catalysts, and it is a major objective of this work to evidence the mechanism involved with hydrotalcites. Several reactions were previously used to evaluate the basic properties of hydrotalcites: decomposition of 2-propanol [20,21] and dispropor- tionation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol [22]. We recently reported that the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and acetone was catalysed by an anionic mechanism. Traces of chlorine inhibited the reaction and the activity increased with the Mg/A1 ratio of the solid [23]. The present work is more specifically devoted to an extensive study of the mechanism and the kinetics of this solid-liquid Claisen-Schmidt reac- tion on hydrotalcite. The results lead us to extend the use of these solids as basic catalysts for the selective condensation of acetonylacetone into 3-methyl-2- cyclopentanone, and to the synthesis of chalcone, in order to illustrate the potentiality of these catalysts in the preparation of valuable products. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The hydrotalcites were prepared by coprecipitation at 343-t-5 K of 300ml aqueous solution of MgC12-6H20(I M) and A1C13-6H20 (0.33 M) (Mg/ A1--3), with an aqueous solution of NaOH (1.3 M) and Na2CO3 (0.12M). The pH was maintained between 8 and 104-0.2 and the addition was completed within 2 h under vigourous stirring. The gels were then aged overnight in the mother liquor at 343 K, filtered and washed several times with hot deionised water until the solution was free of chloride ions (AgNO3 test). The products were dried at 313 K. They con- tained both C1- and CO32- compensating anions, respectively, provided by the reactants and from the contact with air, as established from the chemical analysis data. These samples will be referred to as HT(3)NE. HT(2.5)NE samples were prepared with a Mg/A1 molar ratio of 2.5 using the same procedure. Exchanges of C1- anions were performed by con- tacting the hydrotalcites with a solution of Na2CO3. 2 g of HT(3)NE and HT(2.5)NE were suspended in a 200 ml of 1.5 x 10-2 M solution of sodium carbonate, and stirred at 343 K for 2 h. After filtration, the solids were washed and dried at 313 K. They were denomi- nated HT(3)E-1 and HT(2.5)E-1 (E-l=exchanged once). In order to achieve a higher degree of exchange, HT(3)E-2 was obtained from a second exchange on HT(3)E-1. MgO and a NaY zeolite were used for comparison. MgO (Strem Chemicals) was calcined before use as the hydrotalcite samples. NaY zeolite was a Linde SK-40 from Alfa products. 2.2. Characterisation X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a CGR Theta 60 instrument using Cu Kotl radiation at A=1.542 A (40 kV and 50 mA). Specific surface areas were determined by N2 at 77 K (BET) method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment. The samples were first outgassed (2x 10-4 Torr) overnight at 573 K. Chemical analyses were performed at the Service Central d'Analyse du CNRS (Solaize, France). The calcinations of the samples were carried out in a thin bed configuration using a horizontal furnace flushed with an air flow of about 100 ml rain-1. The heating rate was 50 K h-1 and the final temperature (723 K) was maintained for 5 h. 2.3. Reaction procedure The kinetics of the condensation reaction were followed in a stirred stainless-steel reactor, under nitrogen (to avoid the oxidation of benzaldehyde into benzoic acid by air) at 383 K and at 25 M Pa; 0.8 g of catalyst in commercial 95% ethanol was employed. Benzaldehyde/acetone molar ratios were between 2 and 710-2. It has been shown in a previous study [23] on the influence of the composition and the textural parameters of the catalyst on the activity, that a maximum was obtained when the hydrotalcites were totally exchanged with carbonate and calcined at 723 K. In order to avoid in the present study, the variation of activity due to the catalyst preparation, samples issued from the same batch were used for each series of experiments. A. Guida et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 251-264 253 The reaction products were analysed with a Delsi 30 chromatograph equipped with an OV1 capillary column (25 m). Benzaldehyde was dried and then kept under nitro- gen on basic alumina in order to trap acid impurities, essentially benzoic acid. 3. Results and discussion The chemical compositions (Table 1), anionic con- tent and specific surface areas (Table 2), and the XRD patterns of the samples, given in Fig. l(a) for HT(3)- NE as an example, were consistent with well crystal- lised hydrotalcites. After calcination at 723 K their structure was that of the mixed oxide of the MgO type (Fig. l(b)). The main products observed in the condensation reaction of benzaldehyde and acetone are given in Scheme 1. The benzalacetone 3 is 100% E isomer. It can also condense with benzaldehyde 1 to give the dibenzalacetone 4. This last reaction may be reduced with an excess of acetone versus benzaldehyde. With an acetone/benzaldehyde ratio of 15/1, a selectivity of about 90% in benzalacetone was obtained. Dibenzal- acetone only appeared when the reagent was nearly consumed. In liquid phase reactions catalysed by solid cata- lysts, special care should be taken to avoid diffusion limitations. It was already reported [23] that, in the same experimental conditions, the initial rate (rate of disparition of benzaldehyde measured at a conversion <10%) was constant at stirring speeds between 600 and 1000 rpm. It was also constant for catalyst particle size <0.5 mm. Another series of experiments showed that the rate was proportional to the catalyst weight (Fig. 2). Typical value for the rate of benzaldehyde disparition was 3.410-9 mol 1-1 s-1, with catalyst particles <0.5 mm, using a concentration of reactant of 510-4 moll-1. The criterion of Weisz [24]: ~b=(dN/ dt)(l/Co)(R2/Deff)<O.1, predicts that the process is, indeed, limited by the chemical kinetics.

Initial rate as a function of the weight of catalyst HT(3)E-1; [benzaldehyde]=0.5 moll-I, [acetone]=7.5 mol I i in 95% ethanol at 383 K. indicate that, in the range of conditions: 0.8 g of catalyst, 600 rpm, 383 K, the rate of the reaction is not governed by external mass transfer. A typical procedure was as follows: 0.6 mole of acetone was added to 0.04 mole of benzaldehyde. The volume was completed to 80 ml with 95% ethanol, and 0.8 g of freshly calcined catalyst (723 K under dry air for 5 h) was added; the stirring speed was maintained at 600 rpm. The experimental results (concentration versus time) are represented in Fig. 3. Traces of diacetone alcohol formed by self-condensation of acetone were detected after 20 h of reaction. 3.1. Kinetic study In the range of 20 h, the experimental points fitted well, using the Anacin computer program [25], with the formal kinetical scheme of two first order con- secutive reactions: kl 1~2~3 with l=benzaldehyde, 2=/3-aldol, 3=benzalacetone, The kinetic constants [kl and k2] were: kl= 210-2h -1 and k2=1810-2 h-l; kz/kl=9. Thus, using an excess of acetone versus benzalde- hyde ([acetone],~constant), the condensation re- action was found to be pseudo-first order in benzaldehyde. These results are in good agreement with those of Nondek and Malek [26] and Aguilera et al. [27] for the Claisen-Schmidt condensation, respec- tively, on aluminium oxide and barium hydroxide catalysts. The dehydration reaction, about nine times more rapid than condensation, was not, in our case, the rate- determining step of that reaction. In the chosen con- ditions, the condensation of acetone with benzalde- hyde was sufficiently simple kinetically (pseudo order one) and sufficiently rapid to be used as a test reaction. In the following, the catalytic activity will be 256 A. Guida et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 164 (1997) 251-264 m o E o IN o ~9 100 80 60 40 20 0 I I I I 0 10 20 30 40 50 Time (h) Fig. 3.

The variation of the initial rate with (i) the con- centration of benzaldehyde at constant concentration of acetone (7.5 moll-t) (ii) the concentration of acetone at constant concentration of benzaldehyde (0.15 moll-]) are shown, respectively, in Figs. 4 and 5. Both curves have a similar shape showing a maximum of reactivity for a given concentration of reactant. The kinetic results agree well with Lang- muir-Hinshelwood model for bimolecular reactions [28]. The rate can be written as: V = k,~ACA/~BCB/(I q- /~ACA + ABCB)2, where k is the rate constant, and AA and AB, the adsorption coefficients of acetone and benzaldehyde, respectively. The coefficients can be obtained by simulation of the experimental curves by multilinear regression. The values obtained from the variations of benzaldehyde concentration (k=153, AA=I.3 and AB=53) are consistent with those deduced from the variation of the acetone concentration (k=124, AA=I.2 and AB=41). This concordance suggests that the kinetic model is reasonable. According to this model, the rate-determining step is the condensation between benzaldehyde and acetone, both adsorbed on the same active sites of the hydrotalcite, to form a C-C bond, benzaldehyde being adsorbed in greater amounts than acetone in the operating conditions. 3.2. Influence of the calcination temperature of the hydrotalcite This influence was tested on the HT(3)E-1 sample uncalcined and calcined at increasing temperatures up to 1023 K. The uncalcined sample was totally inac- tive. The activities obtained after calcination between 723 and 1023 K are shown in Fig. 6. The activity culminates between 773 and 823 K, namely, when the catalyst is in the mixed oxide form and still partially hydroxylated [23], then a steep decrease is observed between 823 and 923 K. This behaviour is similar to A.

It suggests that the reaction is catalysed by hydroxyls still present on the hydrotalcite. 3.3. Influence of the water content of the reactants on the reaction rate As suggested earlier, the role of water in this reaction is complex because it reacts with the solid and it is also one of the reaction products. The varia- tion of the initial rate as a function of the water content (titrated by the Karl Fischer method) in the ethanol solvent is reported in Fig. 7. The activity goes through a maximum, obtained for 95% ethanol (corresponding to the azeotrope). Curves with similar shape were encountered in aldolisation reaction over MgO [30] and ZnO catalysts [31]. In the case of the mixed oxides obtained from the hydro- talcites, the increase of activity is due to rehydroxyla- tion and formation of active hydroxyl groups. A previous study on the texture in relation with the catalytic activity of hydrotalcites led us to conclude that the basic sites were mainly the hydroxyl groups [23]. It can be remarked here that the lamellar struc- ture was restored at the end of the reaction. This is in line with other studies [32,22] showing that hydration and reconstitution of the lamellar structure of calcined hydrotalcites is a reversible process. In addition, the amount of water in ethanol, corresponding approxi- mately to a HzO/catalyst ratio of 5/1, explains that in the experimental conditions of this study, with cata- lysts calcined at 723 K, the lamellar structure is easily restored. OH become the compensating anions and induce a high basicity. The decrease of activity observed for water amount higher than 5 wt% in ethanol might be due to the competition of water with the reactants. 3.4. Influence of the solvent on the reaction rate The reaction was so far performed in 95% ethanol which is a polar, protic solvent known, in homoge- 258 A.

Other solvents have been tested: acetone (both solvent and reagent), acetonitrile (polar and aprotic) and cyclohexane (apolar and aprotic). The results are reported in Table 3. With a large excess of acetone, in accordance with the kinetic law of this bimolecular reaction the rate was very low. 95% ethanol gave the best conversion. The dielectric con- stant cannot explain the role of these solvents, which is more straightly related to their acidities. Indeed, the initial reaction rate depended on the basic strength of the sites. The initial reaction rate was low when the stronger basic sites were poisoned by the weakly acidic cyclohexane but remained higher when aceto- nitrile and ethanol poisoned preferably the basic sites of medium strength. In the case of ethanol A.

Comparison of the catalytic activities of HT(2.5)NE, HT(2.5)E-1, MgO and NaY The variation of the initial rate with the concentra- tion of benzaldehyde for HT(2.5)NE, HT(2.5)E-1 and MgO (Fig. 4) shows a maximum at a benzaldehyde concentration of 0.25 tool 1-I for the two hydrotalcite samples, and near 0.38 mol 1-1 for MgO. From the kinetic law, it is well known that the concentration at the maximum is related to AA/AB, the ratio of the adsorption coefficients of benzaldehyde and acetone in competition for the same site [28]. The shift of the maximum from 0.25 to 0.38 mol 1-1 when going from hydrotalcite to MgO corresponds to a weaker adsorp- tion of benzaldehyde on this last sample due to a lower basicity than for the former ones. These results also suggest that the exchange of C1- for CO~- does not change the strength but increases the number of basic sites in the hydrotalcites. A comparison (Fig. 8) between the previous sam- ples and NaY in experiments performed with similar concentration of reactants (acetone/benzaldehyde: 7.5/0.5 mol 1-1) showed that NaY zeolite was much less active. Taking into account the specific area of these samples (Table 2), the order of specific activity was as follows: HT(2.5)E-2>HT(2.5)E-I>MgO>NaY. The exchanged hydrotalcites were the most basic solids. 3.6. Intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone The condensation reaction of acetone and substi- tuted benzaldehydes obeys, as in the homogeneous base-catalysed process, the Hammett correlation between the rate constant and the nucleophilic strength of the different substituents. This clearly shows that this reaction is catalysed by the basic sites of the catalyst [23]. The intramolecular condensation 16 I I I ~:~ 14 ~, 12 ~ 10 N o 8 E -' 6 o~ 2 260 A.

Influence of the initial water content on the initial rate (general procedure) at 383 K on HT(2.5)E-2. of acetonylacetone, a 1-4-diketone, is known to undergo both acid- and base-catalysed intramolecular cyclisations leading to quite distinct products: furan in the former one [34] and cyclopentenone in the latter one [35] (Scheme 2). It is, therefore, a good test reaction to confirm the basic properties of the hydro- talcites. The reaction procedure was similar to the previous one and was performed at, respectively, 383 and 573 K with 0.8 g of HT(3) exchanged and calcined at 723 K for 5 h. The solvent was 95% ethanol. The initial concentration in acetonylacetone was 0.5 moll-~ (0.04 mol). As expected, the only product was 3-methyl-2- cyclopentenone. At 383 K, the reaction was very slow, the equilibrium with the starting reagent being obtained for a 10% conversion in 30 h (Fig. 9). At 573 K, the equilibrium was displaced to the formation of methylcyclopentenone, with a conversion of 65% obtained after 14 h (Fig. 9). The kinetic constants kl and k_l have been determined by Anacin computer program [25] using the formal kinetic Scheme 3. At 383 K: kl=0.007 h-l, k_l =0.065 h-~ ; at 573 K: kl=0.171 h-x, k_l=0.104 h-l. The same reaction performed in a downflow gas reactor at 623 K gave 2-5-dimethylfuran in a yield greater than 97.6% over an acidic HZSM-5 catalyst, whereas 92.6% of 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone were obtained over less acidic Na-ZSM-5 zeolite [36,37]. These results confimrl that the condensation step is catalysed only by the basic sites of the hydrotalcites. This monomolecular reaction needs a relatively high basicity and can be used with more basic solid cata- lysts. 3.7.

O=~CH3 3-methyl-2-cyclopentenone CH-CO-Ph has a synthetic interest and has been performed on hydrotalcites, at 423 K, in liquid phase without solvent [12]. This reaction has been carried out in ethanol, in order to compare the reactivity of acetone with that of acetophenone at 353 and 383 K. The reaction procedure was the same as previously, but the concentrations of benzaldehyde and ketone (acetophenone or acetone) were 0.5 and 2 mol 1-t, respectively; 0.8 g of HT(3)E-2, calcined for 5 h at 723 K, was added and the volume was completed to 80 ml with ethanol. Acetone was more reactive than acetophenone. The relative rates acetone/acetophenone were 22/8.3 at 383 K, and 5/2.5 at 353 K. This is in agreement with the homogeneous reaction where aryl groups are somewhat deactivating compared to alkyl, because of the resonance which stabilizes the substrate [38]. Aguilera et al. [27] found, on Ba(OH)2, that aceto- phenone was more reactive than the ketone. This was explained by an adsorbed carbanion different for each ketone, even if the kinetic equation was the same. The apparent activation energy (,~40 kJ mol-I), near that given by Aguilera et al. [27], shows that the reaction was not limitated by external diffusion. It was totally selective to chalcone, reaching an yield of 20% at 383 K after 24 h. A. Guida et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 251-264 263 100~ I I 80 * 60 40 20 0 O o~ t..

Conclusions Mg/AI hydrotalcites totally exchanged with carbo- nate and calcined at 723 K lead for the condensation reaction of benzaldehyde and acetone, or for the intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone, to pure base-catalysed mechanism. The solvent influ- ences the reaction rate by its acidity, and the water in the reaction medium reacts with the catalyst to hydroxylate the surface, creating active basic sites. A too high amount of water inhibits the reaction. These results explain why 95% ethanol is the best solvent. It was used for the synthesis of chalcone where a 20% yield was obtained over hydrotalcite. References [1] F. Cavani, E Trifiro, A. Vaccari, Catal. Today. 11 (1991) 173. [2] W.T.

Kinetics of Claisen-Schmidt condensation, intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone and synthesis of chalcone Alain Guida Mohammed Hassane Lhouty Didier Tichit * François Figueras 1 Patrick Geneste Laboratoire des Matériaux Catalytiques et Catalyse en Chimie Organique, UMR 5618 ENSCM/CNRS, 8 rue de l'Ecole Normale, 34296 Montpellier Cedex 05, France * Corresponding author. 1 Present address: Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse du CNRS, 2 Avenue A Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne Cedex, France. The activity of hydrotalcites has been investigated by means of several reactions able to evidence their basic properties and the mechanism involved, and also to show their interest in the synthesis of fine chemicals of great practical interest for pharmaceutical applications. With this aim, the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde with excess acetone has been performed in solid-liquid conditions. The kinetic study suggests a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the rate-determining step would be the condensation of benzaldehyde and acetone, in agreement with former results of Hammett correlations. The reaction rate goes through a maximum as a function of calcination temperature of the catalyst, or the water content of the solvent, suggesting that the active sites are basic hydroxyls. These results are obtained by the intramolecular condensation of acetonylacetone as test reaction giving selectively 3-methyl-2-cyclopentanone, and showing, indeed, the presence of mainly basic sites on the hydrotalcite. Taking these results into account, the synthesis of chalcone has been performed over a suitably activated hydrotalcite.
