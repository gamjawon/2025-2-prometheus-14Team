Graphical abstract The development of high-performance and robust catalysts with low-cost is the major demand for electrochemical water oxidation. Here, a unique and facile method is reported for the synthesis of NiFe alloy derived from templated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on carbon cloth, exhibiting excellent water oxidation activity and stability in alkaline solution. The best water oxidation activity is obtained with O-NiFe@C-600, in which overpotential of 250 mV is required for generating water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm−2 and overpotential of 300 mV was needed for affording 100 mA cm−2. In addition, outstanding long-term stability over 25 h in chronoamperometric measurements was achieved for O-NiFe@C-600. The catalysts considerably outperform the activity and stability of the other PBA derived catalysts and even the noble metal catalysts RuO2. The excellent performance is attributable to unique self-supported structures of the PBA-derived NiFe catalysts on carbon cloth as well as the incorporation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by in-situ O2 plasma activation which further increases the number of active sites for water oxidation. Additionally, well-defined graphitized cells largely enhances stability of the catalyst by acting as chemical protective layers. Keywords Electrocatalyst Water splitting Oxygen evolution reaction Prussian blue analogue 1 Introduction Hydrogen energy continues to attract great interest as a clean renewable energy source to solve urgent problems related to future energy needs [1–4]. Hydrogen can be produced via water splitting using electrolyzers in a carbon-free way. The efficiency of hydrogen production is largely dependent on a key half anodic reaction in water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to its sluggish kinetic features [5,6]. OER is kinetically unfavored because multiple electrons and protons are involved. Thus, precious metal oxides, such as IrO2 and RuO2, are utilized as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for reducing overpotential [7]. However, the high cost and scarcity of noble metals hinder the practical application of these electrolyzers in large-scale hydrogen production. Therefore, alternative low-cost, efficient electrocatalysts, with sufficient abundancy and high stability, are in high demand. Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived electrocatalytic materials have been paid much attention due to their high electrochemical activity originated from the increased amount of the active sites [8,9]. In particular, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), one of MOF derived materials, have been enormously investigated for the applications of energy storage or conversion devices such as batteries [10,11], supercapacitors [12], and fuel cells. However, applications of PBAs in the field of electrochemical water splitting, especially for OER, need to be more studied [13–19]. Though, the water splitting activity of PBAs itself is poor, some PBA-derived heterogeneous materials have shown promising OER performance [18–21]. Recently, Lou’s group developed PBA-derived metal oxides for the efficient OER catalysts [22]. Galan-Mascaros’s group reported a cobalt hexacyanoferrate derived from PBAs as water oxidation catalysts [23]. They have developed the PBA-derived catalysts with interesting nanostructures via facile synthetic techniques, however electrocatalytic activity and stability of the materials were not sufficiently high enough compared to recently developed state-of-the-art catalysts. One of possible reason for the lower electrocatalytic activity and stability than expected can be attributed to the lack of use of conductive supports with high surface area; in the first example, the catalyst was derived from the PBAs in powder forms and mixed with ethanol for drop-casting on a glassy carbon electrode, and for the second example, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was employed as a substrate for the electroplating deposition of PBA-derived catalyst. In both cases, deactivation of the catalyst can easily occur due to the mechanical loss of poorly attached catalyst particles. Sufficient adherence between catalysts and electrode surface is extremely important for the electrocatalytic reaction leading to gas evolution because of mechanical stress imposed on the catalyst particles by gas bubbles. Given this context, we are mainly focused on developing PBA-derived catalysts for water oxidation with improved activity and stability through self-templated synthetic approach enabling to grow the catalyst directly onto a conductive support with open structure. Here, we report NiFe alloy nanoparticles derived from self-supported PBAs on carbon cloth (CC) as the conductive template, which exhibit significantly improved water oxidation activity as well as excellent stability. When Fe is alloyed with Ni, the OER performance of Ni-based materials can be boosted tremendously due to the modulation of electronic configurations, resulting in enhanced electrical properties [24]. We used PBAs as precursors for alloying Ni and Fe. Synergetic physicochemical interactions between Ni and Fe atoms can be expected by using PBAs as precursors, because metal atoms have well-defined coordinations within metal ion centers and CN-group linkers thanks to the intrinsic open framework structure of PBA. Furthermore, to make full use of abundant redox Ni and Fe sites derived from PBAs, we employed a facile surface activation process using O2 plasma, which not only increases the number of active sites on the surface, but also improves the activity of reaction sites in the central area [25]. In addition, CN-group linkers in PBAs will form thin graphene layers on the surface of NiFe alloy nanoparticles during heat treatments, which may act as conductive charge transport bridges between the NiFe alloys and CC supports. The thin graphene layer can also be a robust protective shell for the active sites of NiFe alloys by preventing direct contact with corrosive electrolytes. Considering these effects, we expected that OER activity and stability of the PBA-derived NiFe alloys templated on CC can be intriguingly boosted. Self-supported NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NiFe@C) were obtained by annealing Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 PBA precursor (NiFe PBA) templated on CC in Ar flow. The electrocatalytic properties of NiFe PBA were further enhanced via treating NiFe@C in an O2 plasma environment. Surface activated NiFe alloys (O-NiFe@C) derived from the templated PBA showed state-of-the-art OER performance, which rival or outperform recently reported catalysts and even novel RuO2 catalysts. The water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm−2 was produced only at overpotential of 250 mV; for affording 100 mA cm−2, overpotential of 300 mV was needed. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.02 s−1 was calculated at overpotential of 300 mV. No current degradation was observed over a 24 h period under continuous OER in alkaline solution. 2 Experimental procedure Synthesis of NiFe-PBA. The NiFe-PBA were sythesized by a simple precipitation method. In a typical procedure, 143 mg of NiCl2·xH2O were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized (DI) water to form solution A. Then 1 piece of clean CC (1 cm × 3 cm) was immersed into the solution and sonicated for 30 min. At the same time, 132 mg of K3[Fe(CN)6] was dissolved in 20 mL of DI water to form solution B. Then, solutions A and B were mixed together under magnetic stirring for 1 min. The obtained mixed solution was aged for 12 h at room temperature to precipitate NiFe-PBAs on the CC. After collected by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol, the CC with NiFe-PBAs precipitates were dried at 70 °C overnight. Synthesis of NiFe@C. The as-prepared NiFe-PBA were annealed at 600, 700, or 500 °C for 4 h with a heating temperature rate of 5 °C min−1 in argon atmosphere. Synthesis of O-NiFe@C. The as prepared NiFe@C were placed in an UV ozone curing system (Minuta Technology MT GJ84) and treated by ozone for 2hs for each side. Materials characterization. The crystal phase of the products was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/MAX RINT-2000 X-ray diffractometer. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; JEOL-7600F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F) were used to examine the morphology of the samples. TEM samples were prepared by ultrasonication of the carbon cloth based material in ethanol for 30 min. Then the dispersed material was drop-casted on carbon coated Cu grid. The composition of the samples and elemental mapping was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) attached to the TEM instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, VG microtech ESCA2000) used for the analysis of the composition and valence state was performed with monochromatic Al Kα beam for the analysis. Experimental details for electrochemical characterization are given in Supporting Information. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the material design concept used in this work. First, NiFe-PBA was synthesized via a co-precipitation method on CC to secure strong physicochemical contacts between catalysts and conductive supports. The NiFe-PBA on CC was then annealed under Ar to produce NiFe alloys covered with thin graphite shells (NiFe@C); these shells act as protective layers for the dissolutions of Ni and Fe in the electrolyte. Finally, O2 plasma activation was applied to incorporate reactive oxygen species (ROSs) into the surface of NiFe@C; this boosted OER catalytic performance via electrochemical modification of the NiFe@C surface. The crystal structure of NiFe-PBA was examined by XRD. All of the diffraction peaks were assigned to Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2 (JCPDS no. 82–2283) (Fig. S1) with no impurities. SEM and TEM were used to investigate the morphology of NiFe PBA. The SEM images (Fig. S2a) showed that NiFe-PBA was made up of small particles. TEM image reveals that the particle size of NiFe PBA is about a few tens of nanometer (Fig. S2b). Confirming Ni and Fe could be detected in NiFe PBA. The atomic ratio between them was determined to be 3:2, according to the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data shown in Fig. S2c. PBA precursors were calcined at temperatures of 500, 600, and 700 °C in Ar atmosphere. NiFe alloy formed after calcination, as confirmed by XRD data (Fig. S3) [26]. NiFe alloy samples are denoted as NiFe@C-500, NiFe@C-600, and NiFe@C-700, based on the different calcination temperatures. Fig. S4a shows the round-shaped morphology of NiFe@C-600 derived from the NiFe-PBA precursor on CC. The TEM images revealed that the NiFe alloy nanoparticles were covered with thin surface layers of carbon (Fig. S4b). In addition, NiFe-500@C and NiFe-700@C presented similar morphologies to that of NiFe@C-600 (Fig. S5a–d). All NiFe alloy samples were further treated with O2 plasma for 2 h denoted as O-NiFe@C-500, O-NiFe@C-600, and O-NiFe@C-700, respectively. The morphology of O-NiFe@C samples was examined using SEM. The O2 treatment did not have a significant effect on the morphology (Fig. S6a–c). Similarly, XRD patterns of the samples were nearly identical before versus after O2 plasma treatment (Fig. S7). Fig. S8 shows a low-resolution TEM (LR-TEM) image of O-NiFe@C-600 indicating the original round-shaped morphology is well preserved after O2 plasma treatment. The thin surface carbon layers remained intact after O2 plasma treatment. A typical high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of O-NiFe@C-600 is shown in Fig. 2 a. The nanoparticle is wrapped in layered-graphite shells with a d-spacing of approximately 0.35 nm. The 0.21 nm spacing of lattice fringes, which well matched that of the (1 1 1) plane of NiFe alloy, is clearly seen [26]. Partially amorphized hydroxide phases were observed (blue circle) indicating low crystallinity compared with its alloy counterparts as confirmed by the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images on the right. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning tunneling electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) with Z-contrast was employed to differentiate ROS in O-NiFe@C-600 from the surrounding heavy metals, Ni and Fe. Consider that HAADF-STEM imaging contrast is brighter for heavier atoms, ROS with low contrast was observed within NiFe matrix (Fig. 2c). The ROS incorporated Ni-Fe-O nanodomains (marked as white circles) were darker than the adjunct Ni-Fe nanodomains in HAADF-STEM image, indicating formation of MO bonds which may tune the electronic configuration of surface metal atoms. Additionally, STEM measurements with elemental mapping analysis of O-NiFe@C-600 showed well-defined spatial distributions of Ni, Fe, and C (Figs. 2d–f, S8c). EDS analysis indicated a total Ni and Fe content of 6% (Fig. S9). The chemical composition and electronic configuration of O-NiFe@C-600 were further evaluated using XPS. The survey spectrum showed the presence of Ni, Fe, C, and O (Fig. 3 a). The high-resolution Ni2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) revealed two principal peaks centered at 855.1 and 873.1 eV, which were assigned to Ni2p3/2 and Ni2p1/2, respectively [27]. Corresponding shake-up satellites were located at 861.57 and 879.51 eV, respectively. In the Ni 2p 3/2 spectrum, peaks corresponding to Ni 0 (852.8 eV), Ni 2+ (854.55 eV), and Ni 3+ (856.1 eV) were deconvoluted from the main peak. Similarly for Ni 2p 1/2 , the deconvoluted peaks centered at 870.1 eV, 872.3 eV, and 874.5 eV were attributed to metallic Ni, Ni 2+ , and Ni 3+ , respectively, according to previous reports [26,27]. The presence of Fe 2+ (711.3 eV), and Fe 3+ (713.2 eV) was confirmed via deconvolution of the Fe 2p 3/2 spectrum (Fig. 3c) [27,28]. A peak with very low intensity was observed for Fe0 (706.7 eV), indicating most of Fe atoms are oxidized. The deconvoluted peaks for Ni2+/Ni3 + and Fe2+/Fe3+ are attributed to the presence of surface oxide and hydroxide phases, which is also consistent with HR-TEM image (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that Ni and Fe possess mixed valence states, which may be beneficial for improving the catalytic activity of O-NiFe@C due to a flexible electronic configuration. The O 1s spectrum corresponds to incorporated oxygen bonded to C or metal atoms after O2 plasma treatment, such as OCO (531.9 eV), HO (530.3 eV), and metal-O (denoted as MO) (529.4 eV) (Fig. 3d) [28]. A comparison of high-resolution XPS spectra of O-NiFe@C-600 (Fig. 3) and NiFe@C-600 (Fig. S10) demonstrated that in O-NiFe@C-600, the ratios of Ni 3+ to total Ni (43.6%) and MO to total O (38.4%) were all larger than those in the non-O2-plasma-treated counterpart samples (Table S1). Taken together, more MO bonds and a higher oxidation state of metal sites can be induced for NiFe@C via O2 plasma treatment, which will greatly promote water oxidation catalytic activity. We investigated the OER activity of O-NiFe@C electrocatalysts in O2-saturated 1 M KOH at room temperature using a typical three-electrode setup. Details for the electrochemical measurements are given in Supporting Information. For comparison purposes, the pristine NiFe-PBA precursor, O2 plasma-treated NiFe-PBA, NiFe@C, and RuO2 (the benchmark OER electrocatalyst) were also examined under the same conditions. O-NiFe@C-600 was the most efficient for OER, as shown by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 4 a). A high current density of 100 mA cm−2 was achieved with a very low overpotential of 300 mV, showing much better performance than NiFe@C-600 (460 mV), O-NiFe-PBA (560 mV), or the benchmark RuO2 catalyst (450 mV). Notably, a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 300 mV is hardly achieved for CC-supported catalyst systems; additionally, the OER property of O-NiFe@C600 is one of the highest values among state-of-the-art Ni or Fe based electrocatalysts. A detailed comparison of OER properties with different electrocatalysts is shown in Table S2, further confirming the outstanding OER performance of O-NiFe@C-600 [S1–S13]. The OER kinetics of the catalysts were evaluated using Tafel plots (inset of Fig. 4a). O-NiFe@C-600 showed the lowest Tafel slope of 56.72 mV dec−1 (obtained from the LSV data), compared with 57.87, 68.75, 93.93, and 129.37 mV dec−1 for RuO2, NiFe@C-600, O-NiFe-PBA, and NiFe-PBA, respectively, illustrating the fastest OER kinetics of O-NiFe@C-600 among the samples. The electrode kinetics in the OER process were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 1.55 V versus RHE. EIS data of the samples were fitted using Randles equivalent circuit model; constant phase element (CPE) instead of capacitor component was used for O-NiFe-PBA and NiFe-PBA. O-NiFe@C-600 and O-NiFe@C-600 exhibited a much lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct , 1.42 Ω) than the other catalysts (1.53 Ω for NiFe@C-600, 5.31 Ω for O-NiFe-PBA, and 7.64 Ω for NiFe-PBA) tested in this work (Figs. 4b and S12). The lower charge-transfer resistance in O-NiFe@C-600 leads to more favorable charge-transport kinetics. Of note, there were two different electrochemical processes in O-NiFe-PBA (Fig. 4b). The second semicircle may be originated from the phase boundary between oxygen incorporated and bare PBA regions, while the first semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance. No annealing process was performed on O-NiFe-PBA and NiFe-PBA, while O-NiFe@C-600 and NiFe@C-600 were annealed at high temperature. Thus, relatively homogeneous physicochemical properties can be presented in O-NiFe@C-600 and NiFe@C-600 due to recrystallization. However, oxygen incorporation with no subsequent annealing process can induce physicochemical inhomogeneity in O-NiFe-PBA, which can result in different electrochemical responses at the phase boundary. The OER performances of O-NiFe@C synthesized at different temperatures are also shown in Fig. S11. O-NiFe@C-600 exhibited a lower overpotential than those of O-NiFe@C-500 and O-NiFe@C-700, to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The pre-peak observed in the LSV curve for NiFe@C-600 might be due to the thermodynamically favorable formation of nickel or iron (oxy)hydroxides from the oxygen incorporated NiFe alloys when annealed at 600˚C. The corresponding Tafel plots obtained from LSV curves are presented in the inset of Fig. S11. O-NiFe@C-600 shows a lower Tafel slope (56.7 mV dec−1) than O-NiFe@C-500 (60.2 mV dec−1) and O-NiFe@C-700 (60.8 mV dec−1), indicating the fastest OER kinetics in O-NiFe@C-600 among the samples. In addition, the smallest Rct at a potential of 1.55 V was also observed for O-NiFe@C-600. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts was estimated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl). C dl was calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves measured at different scan rates over the potential range of 0.0–0.1 V, where no redox currents occurred (Fig. S12; more detailed information is given in the Supporting Information). The C dl of O-NiFe@C-600 was estimated to be 2.98 mF cm−2, which is higher than that of NiFe@C-600 (2.61 mF cm−2), O-NiFe-PBA (2.25 mF cm−2), and NiFe-PBA (2.03 mF cm−2), by calculating the slope from the linear relationship between current density and scan rate (Fig. 4c). Generally, the current in the non-Faradaic region originated from charging of the double layer has a linear relationship with the ECSA. A flat surface area of 1 cm2 for CC has an average specific capacitance value of 40 μF cm−2 [29,30]. Hence, the Cdl value can be converted to the ECSA by the following equation: ECSA = C dl of catalysts mF cm - 2 / 0.04 ( mF cm - 2 ) The ECSA of O-NiFe@C-600 was calculated to be 74.5 ± 24.5, and other counterparts are determined as 65.25 ± 21.7 (NiFe@C-600), 56.25 ± 18.7 (O-NiFe-PBA), and 50.75 ± 16.9 (NiFe-PBA), respectively. The higher ECSA of O-NiFe@C-600 implies that a higher number of MO bonds and higher oxidation states of metal atoms induced by O2 plasma treatment significantly increase the number of active sites for OER. The water oxidation activities of the catalysts were normalized with ECSA (Fig. S13) and still much better performance of O-NiFe@C-600 is observed demonstrating excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. The intrinsic OER catalytic activity of O-NiFe@C-600 was further evaluated in terms of the TOF, assuming that all Ni and Fe sites were involved in the OER (see Supporting Information for calculation method). Noted that the calculated TOF is a maximum value at a given overpotential assuming that the electrode is working at 100% Faradaic efficient. The TOF associated with O-NiFe@C-600, NiFe, NiFe@C-600, and O-NiFe-PBA at the overpotential of 300 mV were calculated as 0.02, 1.34 × 10−3, and 8.39 × 10−4 s−1, respectively, indicating far better intrinsic OER activity of O-NiFe@C-600 compared with the other catalysts. Stability is another important parameter to evaluate the performance of electrocatalysts in the OER process [31]. O-NiFe@C-600 was tested under continuous chronoamperometric electrolysis in 1 M KOH with an anodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Notably, no current loss was observed for more than 24 h at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d). A small change in the current density at around 12–13 h might be due to the adsorption/desorption of gas bubbles on counter and working electrodes. The excellent durability of O-NiFe@C-600 was also demonstrated in chronoamperometric measurements at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. S14). The initial high current density was retained over 10 h, demonstrating the remarkable stability of O-NiFe@C-600 for OER in an alkaline solution. After the stability tests, we performed SEM, TEM, characterizations to check the compositional or structural changes of the O-NiFe@C-600 catalysts. The morphology of nanoparticles covered with graphite shells was unaffected by the long-term OER test, as confirmed by HR-TEM (Fig. 5 a, b). Ni(OH)2 was generated on the surface of NiFe alloy nanoparticles (Fig. 5c). The high-resolution Ni2p and Fe2p XPS spectrum of O-NiFe@C-600 after the stability test showed an positive shift of Ni2p3/2 and Fe2p3/2 peaks to higher binding energy, indicating higher valence state of Ni and Fe in post-OER species, which illustrates that prominent surface oxidation occurs during water oxidation (Fig. S15). For comparison purposes, we evaluated the long-term stability of NiFe@C-600 and O-NiFe-PBA samples under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. S16, the current density decreased significantly within 10 h for NiFe@C-600 and 1 h for O-NiFe-PBA, indicating poor long-term stability. Current density after 10 hrs was divided by the initial current density to quantitatively estimate long-term stability of the samples. Only 93.7% of the initial current density was retained for NiFe@C-600, while 99.0% was calculated for O-NiFe@C-600, clearly demonstrating a better long-term stability of O-NiFe@C-600 than NiFe@C-600. Figs. S17 and S18 show TEM images of O-NiFe-PBA and NiFe@C-600 after long-term OER tests. Post-OER O-NiFe-PBA showed cubic-like particle morphologies, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed that the O-NiFe-PBA has amorphous phase (Fig. S17(c)). In addition, TEM images of NiFe@C-600 indicated the formation of amorphous Ni(OH)2 thin layers on the surface of the crystalline NiFe phase after long-term OER (Fig. S18). Contrary to O-NiFe@C-600, no graphite shells were observed for NiFe@C-600 after long-term OER, demonstrating the important role of graphite shells in improving long-term OER performance of the catalysts. O2 plasma treatment can activate CC, as well as the surface of NiFe nanoparticle, resulting in strong physicochemical contacts between NiFe and graphite shells. The graphite shell may act as an effective protective layer for O-NiFe@C-600, by preventing direct contact between the surface atoms and the corrosive reactants while also offering conductive pathways for electrons from the surface of O-NiFe@C-600 to the adsorbates (i.e., hydroxide or water molecules). The outstanding OER electrocatalytic activities of O-NiFe@C-600 are mainly due to the following: (1) Water oxidation is commonly proposed to involve nucleophilic attack of water on a high-valent metal oxide species. Generally, Ni (Fe) oxyhydroxide /Ni (Fe) hydroxide/ NiFe alloy is believed to be the OER active site for NiFe-based catalysts, according to previous reports [24,32]. The incorporated ROS induced by in-situ O2 plasma activation may be able to facilitate MOOH phase formation under OER conditions. Importantly, the higher average oxidation state of metal atoms in O-NiFe@C caused by O2 plasma activation will exhibit stronger electrophilicity with OH− ions, and is thus more favorable with respect to mediating water oxidation [33]. (2) The defect-rich and amorphous surface structure of O-NiFe@C-600 can facilitate the OER electrochemical process. Because amorphous materials have a much higher number of randomly oriented bonds compared with their crystalline counterparts, the amorphous phase will possess high quantities of unsaturated surface sites to promote the adsorption/desorption of reactants. Thus, the partially amorphized surface structure of O-NiFe@C after O2 plasma activation, as indicated by HR-TEM analysis (Fig. 2), can boost OER catalytic activity. (3) The unique morphology of O-NiFe@C-600 nanoparticles covered with a thin graphite shell is responsible for the excellent long-term stability of the OER in alkaline solution, even at a high current density. As confirmed by HR-TEM analysis after long-term OER (Fig. 5), the thin graphite shells were well preserved. Physicochemical robustness of the graphite shell can be improved by O2 plasma activation, significantly enhancing long-term stability of O-NiFe@C-600. The graphite shell can successfully prevent dissolution of Ni and Fe atoms into the alkaline solution by blocking direct contact between the catalyst and the corrosive electrolyte, which is also recently demonstrated by Galan-Mascaros group [34]. Hence, robust OER performance can be achieved for O-NiFe@C. We believe that ROS incorporation into transition metal alloys derived via the templated PBA route is a new and facile material design strategy for the development of high-performance and robust electrocatalysts for water oxidation. 4 Conclusion A facile O2 plasma treatment approach was applied to synthesize in-situ surface activated NiFe alloy (O-NiFe@C) with a layered graphite shell derived from the templated Prussian blue analogous (PBA), as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The O-NiFe@C-600 exhibited an overpotential of 300 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2, which represents state-of-the-art oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Incorporated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by in-situ O2 plasma activation increases the oxidation states of MO bonds, facilitating charge transfer between the adsorbents and the catalytic active sites. In addition, the induced surface amorphous hydroxides by O2 plasma treatment can further enhance the electrochemical process. Finally, the well-integrated robust NiFe@C structure facilitate electron transfers and promote long-term stability at low and high current density.

Here, a unique and facile method is reported for the synthesis of NiFe alloy derived from templated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on carbon cloth, exhibiting excellent water oxidation activity and stability in alkaline solution. The best water oxidation activity is obtained with O-NiFe@C-600, in which overpotential of 250 mV is required for generating water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm−2 and overpotential of 300 mV was needed for affording 100 mA cm−2. In addition, outstanding long-term stability over 25 h in chronoamperometric measurements was achieved for O-NiFe@C-600. The catalysts considerably outperform the activity and stability of the other PBA derived catalysts and even the noble metal catalysts RuO2. The excellent performance is attributable to unique self-supported structures of the PBA-derived NiFe catalysts on carbon cloth as well as the incorporation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by in-situ O2 plasma activation which further increases the number of active sites for water oxidation. Additionally, well-defined graphitized cells largely enhances stability of the catalyst by acting as chemical protective layers.",
