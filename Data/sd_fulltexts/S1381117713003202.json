Graphical abstract Iron(III)-porphyrin complexes, regarded as biomimetic models for oxidative enzymes, catalyze the degradation of a tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) derivative that is distributed in landfills. To suppress the deactivation of the catalyst via self-degradation and dimerization, iron(III)-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (FeTMPyP) and iron(III)-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin (FeTPPS) were supported on cation- (FeTMPyP/CER) and anion-exchange (FeTPPS/AER) resins, respectively, and their catalytic activity and durability were examined in the absence and presence of humic acid (HA), which is major component of landfill leachates. The FeTPPS/AER catalyst had a fast reaction rate for TBBPA degradation, but decolorized quickly and had no reusability. In contrast, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was highly durable, catalyzing the degradation of over 90% of the TBBPA and no bleaching was observed in the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst after ten recyclings. Thus, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst can be considered to be a biomimetic model of oxidative enzymes in landfills. 4-(2-Hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol (2HIP-2,6DBP) was the major oxidation product, both in the absence and presence of HA. In the absence of HA, the coupling compound between a TBBPA radical species and 2,6-dibromophenol, which is more toxic than the parent compound, was detected. However, this formation was suppressed in the presence of HA. Keywords Iron(III)-porphyrin Humic acid Ion-exchange resin Catalytic oxidation Tetrabromobisphenol A 1 Introduction Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used brominated flame retardant (BFR) that is used in treatment of paper, textiles, plastics, electronic equipment, upholstered furniture and circuit board laminates [1]. TBBPA derivatives have been detected in leachates from landfills that contain wastes containing BFRs [2,3]. Numerous studies have shown that TBBPA can induce cytotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, and it has the potential for disrupting estrogen signaling [4]. Humic acids (HAs), a ubiquitous and well-known class of naturally occurring polymers, are distributed in soils, aquatic environments, fertilized farm lands and landfills [5]. In landfills, HAs are formed via the aerobic and anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes, and such products enhance the elution of TBBPA from the wastes, which contain BFRs [2]. In addition, organic pollutants in landfills are altered via oxidative enzymes from microorganisms and plants, such as peroxidases [6]. Thus, the enzymatic oxidation of TBBPA can provide potentially useful information regarding its fate in landfills. Iron(III)-porphyrin complexes have been regarded as biomimetic catalysts for the oxidation of a variety of organic substrates via oxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase and ligninase [7,8]. In particular, their capabilities for oxidizing halogenated phenols have attracted interest, because such reactions are related to the metabolism of halogenated phenols [9,10] and to the remediation of contaminated sites [11–13]. In the oxidation of halogenated phenols, negatively charged water-soluble iron(III)-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin (FeTPPS) derivatives have mainly been employed in homogeneous systems for the oxidation of halogenated phenols, such as 2,4,6-tribromophenol, pentachlorophenol and TBBPA [14–18]. However, when iron(III)-porphyrin catalysts are used in a homogeneous system, they are readily deactivated due to rapid self-degradation and dimerization that occurs via the formation of μ-oxo iron species [16,19]. In the actual enzymes, the iron(III)-porphyrin active center is supported by the polymeric structures of peripheral proteins, and such the hybrid structures prevent catalyst deactivation via self-degradation and dimerization. Thus, a variety of immobilized iron(III)-porphyrin catalysts have been examined for the oxidation of organic substrates [20–27]. Clay minerals, zeolites and silica are employed as supports for iron(III)-porphyrins [23,26,27]. Mn(III)-porphyrins are supported on cation- and/or anion-exchange resins to convert olefins to epoxides or alcohols [28–30]. In addition, to mimic the metabolism of biological materials (e.g. l-arginine, heterocyclic amines and glutathione) via peroxidases, iron(III)-porphyrins are supported on ion-exchange resins to prevent their deactivation via aggregation and intermolecular self-oxidation [31–33]. In terms of halogenated phenols, anion-exchange resin supported iron(III)-porphyrins had been applied to the oxidation of 2,6-debromophenol oxidation, but their catalytic activity was found to be relatively low, due to the release of the iron(III)-porphyrin from the support and the fact that the substrate became significantly adsorbed to the anion-exchange resin [34]. The isoelectric points of oxidative enzymes related to cytochrome P-450, such as myoglobin, peroxidase, hydroxylated and heme proteins, are reported to be in the range of 4.6–7.1 [35–38], and the surfaces of such oxidative enzymes are negatively charged at pH 7–10, similar to the pH range of landfill leachates [2]. Thus, supports having anionic surface charges, such as cation-exchange resins, may be suitable for mimicking the oxidation of TBBPA in landfills, because interactions with other components that are present, such as negatively charged HAs, can be minimal. However, there are no reports on the use of iron(III)-porphyrins supported on cation-exchange resins for the oxidation of bromophenols, such as TBBPA. In addition, little is known regarding the influence of HA on the oxidation of TBBPA by ion-exchange resin-supported iron(III)-porphyrins. In the present study, to investigate the differences in catalytic activities for different type of ion-exchange resin supports, cationic and anionic iron(III)-porphyrins were supported on cation- and anion-exchange resins, respectively, and their catalytic activities for TBBPA oxidation in the absence and presence of HA were compared. In addition, to elucidate influence of HA on the fate of TBBPA in landfill, the nature of the oxidation products produced in the absence and presence of HA was compared. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The HA sample used in this study was extracted from Shinshinotsu peat soil (Hokkaido, Japan) and purified by the method approved by the International Humic Substances Society [39,40]. An alkaline extract (0.05M NaOH) from the peat soil was acidified by HCl to a pH below 1. The precipitate and supernatant were separated by centrifugation (3500rpm, 15min), and the resulting precipitate was transferred into dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off of 1000Da, Spectra/Pore). Dialysis was carried out against pure water for 2–3 weeks with stirring. Finally, the powdered form of the HA was obtained after freeze-drying. The elemental composition of this HA was as follows: C 52.15%, H 5.44%, N 2.11%, S 0.36%, and O 39.94%. TBBPA (>98% purity) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Iron(III)-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin (FeTMPyP) was synthesized by refluxing a solution of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (Dojindo Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan) and FeCl2·4H2O in ultra-pure water [41]. FeTPPS was synthesized by refluxing 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (Dojindo Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan) and FeSO4·7H2O in ultra-pure water [42]. Dowex® W2-HCR (H+-type, CER) and Dowex® 22 (Cl−-type, AER) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium monopersulfate (KHSO5) was obtained in the form of a triple salt, 2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4 (Merck). The ultra-pure water used in all experiments was prepared from distilled water using a Milli-Q Simplicity UV Ultra-Pure Water system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). 2.2 Preparation of the supported catalysts CER and AER were mixed twice with aqueous 1M NaCl overnight, filtered and then washed with ultra-pure water to remove excess NaCl. The removal of Cl− from the resins was verified by the lack of AgCl formation in the filtrate. The iron(III)-porphyrin supported catalysts were prepared by shaking 1g of CER and AER with 50mL of a 0.2mM aqueous iron(III)-porphyrins overnight, followed by drying the sample in vacuo at 25°C for 10h. In each case, the iron(III)-porphyrins were completely adsorbed on the resins and were not detected in the filtrate, as evidenced by measuring the absorbance of the porphyrin Soret band (422nm for FeTMPyP and 394nm for FeTPPS) in the UV–visible absorption spectra. The content of loaded iron(III)-porphyrins was estimated to be 10μmolg−1. 2.3 Low vacuum scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) The dried sample was placed on a carbon tape attached to an aluminum sample stage. The surface of the supported catalyst was then observed using a JSM-6510LA-type low vacuum scanning electron microscope and by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) under the following conditions: working distance 10mm; acceleration voltage 15kV. The contents of C, O, Na, S, Cl, Fe and Br on the surface of resins were analyzed by the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. 2.4 Assay for TBBPA degradation A 10mL aliquot of 0.02M citric acid/NaHPO4/NaOH/Na2CO3 buffer at pH 4–10 was placed in a 100-mL Erlenmeyer flask. A 50μL aliquot of 0.01M TBBPA in acetonitrile and 5mg of the catalyst was then added to the buffer. Aqueous solutions of 1000mgL−1 HA in a 0.05M NaOH solution and 100μL of 0.1M KHSO5 were added, and the flask was then subjected to shaking at 25°C in an incubator. During the reaction, 600μL aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and mixed with 300μL of 2-propanol. The concentrations of the residual TBBPA in this solution were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV detector. The separation of TBBPA in the reaction mixture was accomplished using a COSMOSIL 5C18-AR-II column (4.6mmø×250mm). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of methanol and 0.08% of H3PO4 aqueous (80/20, v/v). The flow rate of the eluent and the detection wavelength were set at 1.0mLmin−1 and at 220nm, respectively. The concentrations of the inorganic bromine (Br− and BrO3 −) that was released in this solution were determined by ion chromatography (ICS-90 type, Dionex). The mobile phase was an aqueous mixture of 2.7mM Na2CO3 and 0.3mM NaHCO3, and the IonPac AS12A type column (Dionex) was employed as a stationary phase. The flow rate of the eluent was set at 1.5mLmin−1. 2.5 Analysis of oxidation products A 25mL aliquot of buffer solution at pH 8 was placed in a 100-mL Erlenmeyer flask. The 250μL of TBBPA stock solution (0.01M), 12.5mg of the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, and/or 500μL of HA aqueous solution (1000mgL−1) were then added. After adding 250μL of KHSO5 (0.1M), the solution was allowed to shake for 0.5–6h at 25°C. After completion of the reaction, 2mL of 1M ascorbic acid, and 0.5mL of 1mM anthracene in an acetone/hexane mixture (1:1, v/v) as an internal standard were added, and the pH was then adjusted to 11–11.5 by adding aqueous K2CO3 (600gL−1). The oxidation products in this solution were acetylated by adding 5mL of acetic anhydride. The acetylated compounds were extracted twice with 15mL of portions of n-hexane and the combined extracts were dehydrated with Na2SO4. After evaporating the dried extract to 250μL using a stream of N2, a 1μL aliquot of this was introduced into a GC-17A/QP5050 GC/MS system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The analytical conditions for the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were as outlined in a previous report [17]. 4-(2-Hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol (2HIP-2,6DBP) was synthesized as a standard material of by-product according to a previous report [43]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The influence of pH on TBBPA degradation and debromination Fig. 1a shows the influence of pH on the percent degradation of TBBPA via the heterogeneous catalytic systems using the FeTMPyP/CER and FeTPPS/AER catalysts. For the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, the percent degradation of TBBPA was less than 10% at pH 4–7, while the efficiency of TBBPA degradation was significantly increased up to 90–100% above pH 8. For the FeTPPS/AER catalyst, the percent of TBBPA degradation was less than 10% at pH 4–6, and were slightly decreased above pH 9. Fig. 1b shows data for the debromination of TBBPA at pH 8, 9 and 10. Both Br− and BrO3 − were detected in the reaction mixture at pH 8, while only Br− was observed at pH 9 and 10. At pH 4–7, no inorganic bromine, i.e. Br− and BrO3 −, were detected for the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, while 5–24μM of Br− and BrO3 − were detected for the FeTPPS/AER catalyst. The concentration of Br− and BrO3 − for the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was significantly larger than the corresponding values for FeTPPS/AER system. Because lime is frequently employed in landfills to suppress the acidification that occurs as the result of the decomposition of organic matter, the pH values in landfills are typically in the weakly alkaline region [2,44–46]. Thus, the effective pH for degradation of TBBPA via both biomimetic models of oxidative enzymes in landfills is similar to the actual pH values in landfills (8–10). 3.2 Comparison of the degradation kinetics Fig. 2 shows the degradation kinetics for the FeTMPyP/CER and FeTPPS/AER catalysts in the presence and absence of HA at pH 8. In the absence of HA, the percent TBBPA degradation approached 100% within 2h in the case of FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, while the complete degradation of TBBPA occurred within 10min in the case of the FeTPPS/AER catalyst. The kinetic curve for a homogeneous FeTPPS system (see Appendices A and B, Fig. SM1) was similar to that for the FeTPPS/AER catalyst (Fig. 2b). In the presence of 50mgL−1 HA, the initial rate for the degradation of TBBPA remained unchanged, compared to that in the absence of HA (Fig. 2b). For the case of the FeTPPS/AER catalyst at pH 4–10, its original green color was bleached and then turned to a yellow color, which is the original color of the anion-exchange resin during the reaction. However, in the case of the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, the color of the material did not become bleached at pH 4–10. In addition, the iron in the reaction mixtures was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICPE-9000, Shimadzu, Japan), and 2μM of iron was detected in the case of the FeTPPS/AER catalyst. These results show that a homogeneous catalytic system catalyzed by the eluted FeTPPS is implicated in the degradation of TBBPA via the FeTPPS/AER catalyst. In the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, the degradation of TBBPA was significantly retarded in the presence of HA (Fig. 2a). The pseudo-first-order rate constant decreased with increasing concentration of HA (see Appendices A and B, Fig. SM2). These results indicate that some moieties of the HA structure (e.g. phenolic moieties) compete with the oxidation reactions of TBBPA [47]. The inorganic species Br− and BrO3 − were found in the reaction mixtures. Fig. 3a shows the kinetics of debromination for the FeTMPyP/CER and FeTPPS/AER catalysts in the presence and absence of HA. In the absence of HA (Fig. 3a ■ and b ▴), the sum of [Br−] and [BrO3 −] ([Br−]+[BrO3 −]) initially increased and then decreased gradually, while debromination increased with increasing reaction time in the presence of HA. Data related to the kinetics of debromination for Br− and BrO3 − are shown in Fig. 3c. The concentration of Br− initially increased and the decreased gradually. However, BrO3 − increased after a 1h period, but was not detected at times shorter than 1h. These suggest that Br− is formed initially and is then oxidized to BrO3 − during the reactions. The decrease in [Br−]+[BrO3 −] in the absence of HA may be due to the further oxidation of Br− and BrO3 − to BrO4 −, a species that cannot be analyzed by ion chromatography. In the presence of HA, the debromination gradually increased with increasing reaction time for the FeTMPyP/CER and FeTPPS/AER catalysts. Because HA inhibits the oxidation of TBBPA as described in Fig. 2 and Fig. SM2, further oxidation of Br− and BrO3 − may also be inhibited. Although the percent degradation of TBBPA was approximately 100% for each catalyst in the absence of HA (Fig. 2), debromination by the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was much larger than that by the FeTPPS/AER catalyst (Fig. 3). This can be attributed to the fact that anionic bromine species, such as Br− and BrO3 −, are adsorbed to the FeTPPS/AER catalyst via anion-exchange reactions. 3.3 Characterization of the catalyst surfaces To check the stability of the supported iron(III)-porphyrins, catalyst reusability was examined, in terms of the degradation and debromination of TBBPA. After a reaction with each catalyst, the solid catalyst was collected on a filter, and then washed with 2-propanol and ultra-pure water. As described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, the color of the FeTPPS/AER catalyst was bleached during the reaction. When the TBBPA oxidation was examined using the bleached FeTPPS/AER catalyst, neither degradation nor debromination were observed. It thus appears that the FeTPPS/AER catalyst is deactivated during the reaction and is not suitable for a biomimetic model for an oxidative enzyme. As shown in Appendices A and B, Fig. SM3a, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was much more durable and over 90% of the TBBPA was degraded in the presence or absence of HA after ten recyclings. The variation in [Br−] and [BrO3 −] from TBBPA during recyclability test were also not varied (see Appendices A and B, Fig. SM3b). In addition, no bleaching was observed in the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst, even after 10 recyclings. The elemental compositions for the surfaces of the solid catalysts were analyzed using SEM-EDS (Table 1 ). The Fe content on the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst before use remained constant for up to 10 recyclings, consistent with higher reusability of the catalyst in Appendices A and B, Fig. SM3a. Although the exchange-cation, Na, was not varied before and after use, the Br content increased after 10 recyclings. This may be attributed to the fact that TBBPA and its brominated intermediates accumulate on the surface of the ion-exchange resin via the hydrophobic interactions. On the other hand, for the FeTPPS/AER catalyst, the Fe content after use was much lower than that before its use (Table 1), being consistent with the result that the FeTPPS was eluted during the reaction. In addition, the Br content largely increased after using the FeTPPS/AER catalyst, while the Cl content decreased (Table 1). These results indicate that anionic Br species, such as Br− and BrO3 −, are exchanged with the counter anion Cl− on the surface of the FeTPPS/AER catalyst via the anion-exchange reaction. These results demonstrate that the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst is suitable for a biomimetic model of oxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase, in landfills. 3.4 Patterns of oxidation products in the presence and absence of HA To identify the oxidation products in the absence and presence of HA, n-hexane extracts from the reaction mixtures for the FeTMPyP/CER system were analyzed by GC/MS. Fig. 4 shows chromatograms of n-hexane extracts from reaction mixtures at pH 8 in the presence and absence of HA. In the presence of HA, for a 2h period, a peak with a retention time of 17.8min was detected as a major oxidation product, as shown in Fig. 4a. This peak was assigned as 4-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol (2HIP-2,6DBP) acetate based on mass spectral data: m/z [relative intensity, fragment identify], 352 [3.17, M+], 310 [33.5, (M–CH2CO)+], 295 [100, (M–CH3CH2CO)+], 252 [1.53, C6H4OBr2 +]. In the absence of HA, 2HIP-2,6DBP was also detected as a major product for a 0.5h period (data not shown). Based on the ratio of peak areas for 2HIP-2,6DBP to ISTD, the percent conversion of TBBPA to 2HIP-2,6DBP was estimated to be 38% and 8% in the presence and absence of HA for each reaction period, respectively. However, in the presence of HA, the level of 2HIP-2,6DBP decreased for a 6h period, and no oxidation products were detected (Fig. 4b). In the absence of HA, 2HIP-2,6DBP decreased for the first 3h, and a new peak with a retention time of 53.0min appeared a times above 3h and then increased by 6h (Fig. 4c). This peak was assigned as the coupling compound between a radical species of TBBPA and 2,6-dibromophenol. The mass spectral data were as follows: m/z [relative intensity, fragment identify], 836 [48.6, M+], 794 [100,(M–CH2CO)+], 779 [48.2, (M–CH3CH2CO)+], 293 [20.7, C6H2(CH3CO2)Br2 +], 277 [18.0, C6H3(CH3)2Br2C+], 267 [26.8, C6H2O(OH)Br2 +]. It has been reported that such phenoxyphenols are more toxic than the parent compounds [48,49]. However, in the presence of HA, no formation of coupling compounds was observed after a reaction of 6h (Fig. 4b). In the presence of HA, brominated intermediates are incorporated into the HAs [17] and this results in preventing coupling reactions between radical species from TBBPA and 2,6-DBP. In addition, the toxicities of the reaction mixtures for the TBBPA oxidation by the FeTPPS catalyst are significantly reduced in the presence of HA, compared to those in the absence of HA [50]. These results suggest that the presence of HA inhibits the coupling reactions between TBBPA and related oxidation intermediates by the iron(III)-porphyrin catalyst. 4 Conclusions Iron(III)-porphyrins supported on cation- and anion-exchange resins were prepared for the degradation of TBBPA in the presence of HA, a major component in landfills. FeTMPyP supported on a cation-exchange resin was found to be a suitable catalyst for mimicking the oxidation of TBBPA via oxidative enzymes in landfills. For the oxidation of TBBPA, the coupling compound of TBBPA with 2,6-DBP, which is more toxic than the parent compound, was detected in the absence of HA. However, its formation was suppressed in the presence of HA, suggesting that HAs play an important role in suppressing the toxicity of reaction intermediates via the enzymatic oxidation of TBBPA in landfills.

To suppress the deactivation of the catalyst via self-degradation and dimerization, iron(III)-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (FeTMPyP) and iron(III)-tetrakis(4-sulfonatephenyl)porphyrin (FeTPPS) were supported on cation- (FeTMPyP/CER) and anion-exchange (FeTPPS/AER) resins, respectively, and their catalytic activity and durability were examined in the absence and presence of humic acid (HA), which is major component of landfill leachates. The FeTPPS/AER catalyst had a fast reaction rate for TBBPA degradation, but decolorized quickly and had no reusability. In contrast, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst was highly durable, catalyzing the degradation of over 90% of the TBBPA and no bleaching was observed in the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst after ten recyclings. Thus, the FeTMPyP/CER catalyst can be considered to be a biomimetic model of oxidative enzymes in landfills. 4-(2-Hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol (2HIP-2,6DBP) was the major oxidation product, both in the absence and presence of HA. In the absence of HA, the coupling compound between a TBBPA radical species and 2,6-dibromophenol, which is more toxic than the parent compound, was detected. However, this formation was suppressed in the presence of HA.",
