Tel.: +86-2165642792; fax: +86-2165641740. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 over Fe-containing mixed oxide catalyst prepared from hydrotalcite-like precursors is reported. Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst affords an ethylbenzene conversion of 53.8% and a styrene selectivity of 96.7% at 773K. Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2 was investigated over a series of catalysts prepared by calcination of hydrotalcite-like compounds. Mg/Fe mixed oxide catalysts prepared in this way have high specific surface areas and are active for the dehydrogenation reaction. Incorporation of Al3+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ into the hydrotalcite-like precursors may further enhance the catalytic activity of the calcined catalysts. The Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst affords the highest ethylbenzene conversion of 53.8% and a styrene selectivity of 96.7% at 773K. The high catalytic activity and stability of the Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst are attributed to the presence of a larger amount of stronger acid sites and a moderate amount of base sites on the catalyst. The temperature-programmed reduction studies show that the reduction of iron oxide species in the catalysts is retarded after incorporation of Zn2+ and Al3+. The higher content of iron oxide species in the catalyst system under reaction conditions favors the redox cycle in the reaction and also enhances the dehydrogenation activity. Keywords Hydrotalcite-like compounds Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation Styrene CO2 1 Introduction Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) over a promoted iron oxide catalyst in the presence of a large excess amount of superheated steam is the current industrial process for producing styrene. Since its main drawbacks are high energy costing and severe cracking, the seeking of an alternative technology is underway worldwide. Oxidative dehydrogenation of EB can be operated at low temperature and it is free from thermodynamic limitations regarding conversion. CO2 is a mild oxidant as well as a green house gas, and its utilization in the dehydrogenation of alkanes and aromatics has aroused increasing interest. Dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 has been studied over a variety of metal oxide catalysts such as iron oxide [1–5], vanadium oxide [6–9], zircomium oxide [10,11], and chromium and cerium oxides [12]. Among these catalysts, the V/MgO catalyst gives the best performance in dehydrogenation of EB [8]. The styrene yield in the presence of CO2 is 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of CO2 at 823K. However, the catalyst deactivates rather quickly. The iron oxide-based and other catalysts are less active for the reaction. In particular, the initial yield of EB in the presence of CO2 is often lower than that in the presence of inert gases over these catalysts [1,4]. Thus, to develop catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity and stability is required. Hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlcs) have the general formula [M(II)1−x M(III) x (OH)2](A x/n n−)·mH2O, where M is a metal and A is an anion, usually carbonate in natural minerals. For hydrotalcite-like materials, the metallic cations are homogeneously distributed in the brucite-like layers. Compared to the catalysts prepared by coprecipitation, the catalysts obtained by thermal decomposition of hydrotalcite-like precursors exhibit high surface area, high thermal stability and highly homogenous metal dispersion [13]. Recently, Mimura et al. [14] reported that calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds display better activity for dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 than Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by coprecipitation method. In the present work, a series of binary, ternary and quaternary Fe-containing HTlcs were prepared. The catalytic behaviors of the catalysts obtained from calcination of these compounds for dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 were investigated and correlated with the results of surface acidity and basicity measurements and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The hydrotalcite-like precursors were synthesized using a coprecipitation method similar to that described by Mimura et al. [14]. Solution A was prepared by dissolving the mixture of M(II)(NO3)2 and M(III)(NO3)3 in the desired molar ratios in 200ml of water. Solution B was prepared by dissolving a calculated amount of Na2CO3 (according to the relation of [CO3 2−] = 0.5[M(III)]) in 100ml of water. Under vigorous stirring, the solutions of A and B were simultaneously and slowly added into a 500ml flask, while a 2M NaOH solution was now and then added to keep the pH in the range of 9.0±0.5. After all the solutions were added, the slurry was stirred for 3h at 333K, and then aged for another 24h. The precipitate was filtered, washed and dried at 393K overnight. The hydrotalcite-like precursors were calcined at 823K for 12 in air, unless otherwise noted. 2.2 Characterization The BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N2 desorption at 77K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIA diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406Å) operated at 30kV and 20mA. TPR experiments were carried out using a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 instrument. Thirty milligrams of catalyst was pretreated in N2 at 573K for 3h. A reduction run was then performed at a heating rate of 10Kmin−1 under a gas flow (40mlmin−1) of hydrogen (10vol.%) and argon (90vol.%). Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) and CO2 (CO2-TPD) was performed in a flow-type fix-bed reactor equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at atmospheric pressure. Forty milligrams of sample was pretreated at 773K for 2h and then cooled to 393K in He flow for NH3-TPD or 353K in He flow for CO2-TPD. Pure NH3 or CO2 was injected until adsorption saturation followed by purging with He for 2h. The temperature was then raised up from 393 or 353 to 773K at a rate of 10Kmin−1 to desorb NH3 or CO2. 2.3 Activity test The dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 was carried out in a flow-type fixed-bed microreactor loaded with 200mg of catalyst under atmospheric pressure. To supply the reactant, a gas mixture of N2 and CO2 (19:1 molar ratio) at a flow rate of 60mlmin−1 was passed through a glass evaporator filled with liquid EB maintained at 273K. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated at 773K in N2 for 2h unless otherwise stated. The hydrocarbon products were analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 2m long stainless steel column packed with 15% DNP. The effluent from the reactor was also collected in a gas bag and analyzed the content of CO and CO2 with a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a 6m long stainless steel column packed with porapak Q. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD results The synthesis of binary Mg/Fe HTlcs was carried out at Mg:Fe molar ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 by coprecipitation method. Substituting Fe3+ by Al3+, Mg/Al/Fe HTlcs with various compositions are obtained by the same preparation method. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1 . The peaks at 11.5, 23.1, 34.5, 38.6, 46.5, 59.9, 61.7° are characteristic of the hydrotalcite-like structure. M(II) ions having ionic radii not too different from that of Mg2+ can also form HTlcs [13]. Hydrotalcite-like precursors (Mg/M/Al/Fe = 3/3/1/2) containing Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ were prepared. Their XRD patterns are similar to those of Mg/Fe HTlcs. The Mg/Fe (2/1) hydrotalcite-like precursor was calcined at different temperatures. From the XRD patterns of the calcined samples in Fig. 2 , three weak broad peaks are observed at 35.4, 42.8, 62.2° for samples calcined below 973K corresponding to characteristic diffractions of MgFe2O4 and MgO. As the calcination temperature further increases, the intensities of these peaks are increased and other peaks of MgFe2O4 at 30 and 57° appear, indicating that the formation of MgFe2O4 spinel structure is enhanced at high temperature. The XRD patterns of the ternary and quaternary hydrotalcite-like precursors calcined at 823K are illustrated in Fig. 3 . The diffraction peaks of the calcined Mg/Al/Fe sample are weaker and broader than those of the calcined Mg/Fe sample, indicating that smaller crystallites are formed. This observation is consistent with the results of surface area measurements as shown in Tables 1 and 2 . No distinct peak is observed for all the other calcined samples, showing that amorphous oxides are formed. It seems that the substitution of Mg2+ by other divalent metal cations inhibits the formation of spinel structures during calcination. 3.2 Catalytic performance The dehydrogenation of EB was carried out in the presence of CO2 at 773K over catalysts prepared by calcination of the HTlcs. Styrene is the major product of the reaction, whereas benzene and toluene are minor by-products. The reaction data after 2h on stream are compared. The catalytic activities of Mg/Fe catalysts calcined at different temperatures along with the results of surface area measurements are summarized in Table 1. Among the Mg/Fe catalysts with different compositions calcined at 823K, Mg/Fe (2/1) catalyst gives the highest activity regardless of its low surface area, showing the important role of Fe for the reaction. The activity of the catalysts decreases as the calcination temperature is raised above 873K. The formation of MgFe2O4 spinel structure with low surface area at high temperature is probably the cause for the reduction in activity. The effect of the incorporation of Al3+ and various bivalent metal cations into the catalysts on their catalytic performance is described in Table 2. The catalytic activity of the catalysts decreases in the order of Mg/Zn/Al/Fe > Mg/Ni/Al/Fe > Mg/Co/Al/Fe > Mg/Al/Fe > Mg/Mn/Al/Fe > Mg/Cu/Al/Fe. Obviously, some of them are more active than the Mg/Fe catalyst, in particular the Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst displaying a maximum EB conversion of 53.8% and a styrene selectivity of 96.7%. Under similar reaction conditions, the Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst seems even more active for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than the Mg/V/Al catalyst reported in a recent literature [15]. The effect of reaction time on EB conversion over some representative catalysts is shown in Fig. 4 . The Mg/Fe catalyst deactivates rather fast in the first 3h and then becomes almost stable. Comparing the activity change with time of the three catalysts shows that the incorporation of Zn2+ and Al3+ into the catalysts not only increases the dehydrogenation activity but also improves the catalyst stability. The Mg/Al/Fe and Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalysts are almost stable after 2h on stream. A regeneration treatment of the catalysts after 6h reaction at 773K was attempted. As shown in Fig. 5 , EB conversions on Mg/Zn/Al/Fe and Mg/Fe catalysts decrease from 58.8 and 49.6% at 1h to 40.0 and 20.1% at 6h, respectively. The reaction was interrupted under a nitrogen stream, and then air was introduced to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalysts. After air treatment at 773K for 2h, the catalysts were purged with N2 for 2h. The EB conversions on the regenerated catalysts are lower than the initial conversions, showing that the original activity of the catalysts could not be fully restored. Meanwhile, after the second regeneration the activity of Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst is almost fully restored, while the Mg/Fe catalyst exhibits a conversion slightly lower than that after the first regeneration. The increase in activity after regeneration is due to the removal of the carbonaceous deposit on the catalysts. The difference in the regeneration behavior between the two catalysts indicates that the Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst has a higher catalytic stability than the Mg/Fe catalyst. Table 3 summarizes the effects of reaction temperature and pretreatment atmosphere on the catalytic properties of Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst. The dehydrogenation activity increases significantly with the increase of reaction temperature, but the selectivity to styrene is slightly decreased. The amount of benzene and toluene in the reaction product is increased, showing that cracking reaction is favored at higher temperature. The catalyst pretreatment atmosphere has an evident effect on the activity of the catalyst. Prereduction of the catalyst is undesirable for the reaction. In order to understand the role of CO2 in the reaction, the variation of the amount of CO in the reaction product with reaction time on Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst was tested and given in Fig. 6 . The amount of CO formed in the reaction is only slightly lower than that of styrene at the beginning, but it decreases gradually with reaction time. This suggests that both oxidative dehydrogenation and simple dehydrogenation reaction are probably present on the catalyst, as shown below: C 6 H 5C 2 H 5+CO 2→C 6 H 5CHCH 2+CO+H 2 O C 6 H 5C 2 H 5→C 6 H 5CHCH 2+H 2 Although oxidative dehydrogenation dominates at the initial stage of the reaction, it is accompanied by simple dehydrogenation as time goes on. The carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface or the poisoning of some oxidative dehydrogenation sites by CO might be the reason for the change of reaction mechanism. This deserves further studies. 3.3 Acid–base properties NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD methods were used to measure the acid–base properties of some representative catalysts and the results were listed in Table 4 . Incorporation of Zn2+ and Al3+ into the catalyst increases the amount of stronger acid sites and the total amount of base sites on the catalyst surface. Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst is abundant in stronger acid sites and has a moderate amount of base sites in comparison with the other two catalysts. The oxidative dehydrogenation of EB is suggested by various authors [16–19] to proceed through the following steps: the adsorption of EB on an acid site, the abstraction of α-hydrogen from EB by a basic OH group adjacent to the acid site, the formation of an anion vacancy via desorption of water, the filling of the vacancy site by O− species formed from adsorbed O2 or CO2 and the abstraction of β-hydrogen from EB by the O− species to give styrene and basic OH group. According to this reaction mechanism, both acid and base sites are necessary for the reaction. The large number of stronger acid sites on Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst enhances the adsorption and activation of EB molecules, and the availability of adjacent basic OH groups on the catalyst promotes the abstraction of α-hydrogen from EB molecules to form water. This may constitute one of the reasons for the enhanced dehydrogenation activity of the Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst. 3.4 TPR study The TPR profiles of α-Fe2O3 and the representative catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 7 . There are two reduction peaks on the profile of α-Fe2O3, corresponding to the reduction of α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and Fe, respectively [20]. The TPR profile of Mg/Fe catalyst looks similar to that of α-Fe2O3, except that the first peak temperature is increased. However, the reduction of Mg/Al/Fe and Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalysts gives a different picture. The second reduction peaks on the profiles of these catalysts shift to temperatures well above 1000K. It has been suggested that the iron oxide species, such as ferrites, composite oxide or magnetite, are the active components in this type of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 [1,2,4,5,21]. The iron oxide species take part in the redox cycle with EB and CO2 in the reaction. Our experimental results seem to support this postulation, since the dehydrogenation activity increases with the amount of iron oxide in the catalysts and prereduction with H2 deteriorates the catalytic activity of the catalysts. Based on this postulation as well as the TPR results, the increase in catalytic activity and stability of the catalysts after incorporation of Zn2+ and Al3+ can also be ascribed to the restricted reduction of the iron oxide species under reaction conditions besides their favorable acid–base properties. 4 Conclusions A series of Fe-containing HTlcs were prepared by coprecipitation method. Mg/Fe catalysts prepared by calcination of the hydrotalcite-like precursors have high specific surface areas and are active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2. Incorporation of Al3+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ into the HTlcs increases the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts. The Mg/Zn/Al/Fe (3/3/1/2) catalyst exhibits the highest EB conversion of 53.8% at 773K with a styrene selectivity of 96.7%. Slower deactivation is observed on Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst than Mg/Fe catalyst, and the activity of the catalyst can be restored after burning of the carbonaceous deposit. The amount of CO produced during the reaction agrees well with the amount of styrene at the initial stage of the reaction on Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst, but is reduced by a factor of 44% as reaction goes on, indicating that the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is probably accompanied with the simple dehydrogenation reaction to a minor extent. Acid–base measurements of the catalysts reveal that the existence of a larger amount of stronger acid sites and a moderate amount of base sites accounts for the high dehydrogenation activity of Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst. TPR studies show that the reduction of the iron oxide species in the catalysts is retarded after the incorporation of Zn2+ and Al3+. The restricted reduction of iron oxide species under the reaction conditions favors the redox cycle in the reaction and enhances the catalytic activity and stability of Mg/Zn/Al/Fe catalyst.
