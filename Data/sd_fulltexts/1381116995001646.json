Important parameters to obtain high enantioselectivities using the homogeneous system were shown to be the ligand, the nature of the Rh complex and the solvent. Unfortunately, the best optical yields (ee 96%) were achieved only at a low substrate/catalyst ratio of s/c = 50. For the heterogeneous system, the structure and concentration of the modifier, the nature and pretreatment of the Pt/AI203 catalyst, the type of solvent and the hydrogen pressure were decisive for high enantioselectivity (ee's up to 95%). A major problem was the effect of the substrate quality on rate and optical yield. A comparison of catalyst costs showed a significant advantage for the heterogeneous catalyst, mainly due to its very high activity and catalyst productivity.

Introduction and background The industrial application of enantioselective catalysts is still rather limited [ 1 ]. There are sev- eral reasons for this situation. Up to a few years ago, only very few catalytic systems were able to give the high optical yields necessary for a tech- nical application. Today, this is no longer the case since hundreds of examples are now in the litera- ture with optical yields > 95%. Still, there remain many obstacles before a chiral catalyst is applied on a technical level. Activity, productivity, han- dling, separation and cost are probably the most important additional factors that decide whether a * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Optically pure ce-hydroxyacid derivatives are of interest as intermediates for the synthesis of a wide variety of products such as amino acids, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [2,3] or coenzyme A [4]. An elegant method for their synthesis is the enantioselective hydrogena- tion of the corresponding a-ketoacid derivative. In the last few years, considerable work was car- ried out at Ciba-Geigy in order to develop an enan- tioselective production method for ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate, an important intermediate for the ACE inhibitor Benazepril (Fig. 1). Our results for the enantioselective reduction of 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyric acid by bio- catalytic methods were already summarized ear- 86 H.-U.

The present article describes the strategies and results for the development of the enantioselective hydrogenation of ethyl 2-oxo-4- phenylbutyrate (1) using homogeneous Rh- diphosphines complexes and cinchona modified heterogeneous Pt catalysts. 2. Strategies for process development The choice of a development strategy that promises the best answer in the shortest time is the first decision at the start of a process devel- opment. This strategy will depend on a number of considerations: The goal of the development; the know how of the investigators; the time frame; the available manpower and equipment; and so on. As a general rule, the parameters of the catalytic sys- tem will be chosen first (metal, support or ligands, chiral auxiliary, solvent and maybe some addi- tive). Naturally, the first choice will rely on expe- rience and on analogies in the literature. Depending on the results of this preliminary phase, one then has to decide whether to find better catalysts by screening alternative structures or by optimizing the most promising catalytic system by small changes of the catalyst and the chiral auxiliary. When a definitive choice has been made, the reaction conditions (H2 pressure, tem- perature and concentrations and ratios of reac- tants, catalyst and auxiliary) are optimized. If the minimal requirements are not reached, one has to go back to finding a more suitable catalyst/aux- iliary. Then, the optimization has to be repeated. This means that very often, the development of a technical process does not proceed linearly. In process development, there is usually a hier- archy of goals (or criteria) to be met. It is simply not possible to reach all the requirements for a technically useful process in one step. Usually, the catalyst selectivity (combined of course with an acceptable activity) is the first criterion -just as in academic research. But when a reasonable selectivity has been obtained, other criteria will become important: catalyst activity, productivity and stability, catalyst separation (and maybe recy- cling). Then, questions like e.g., the effect of sub- strate quality and last but not least the cost of the chiral catalyst and other materials have to be addressed. The final process is usually a compro- mise since quite often not all of these requirements can be fulfilled maximally. In the following sections we will discuss the approaches taken for the selection of the different components of both the homogeneous and the het- erogeneous catalytic systems. The results obtained for the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are compared and discussed. 3. Homogeneous system 3.1. Preliminary experiments When we started our investigations ca. 1984, the best results for a-ketoester~ were reported by Ojima [6] for the Rh-bppm-C1 catalyst. How- ever, first experiments with ethyl 2-oxo-4-phen- ylbutyrate (1) gave optical yields (ee 50-65%) well below the published results for pyruvates (ee 76%). In order to get better enantioselectivities we could either vary and optimize the structure of H.-U, Blaser et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 85-94 87 the bppm ligand or we could try to find another class of ligands. Because the synthesis of diphos- phines requires special know how that we did not have at that time, we decided to screen the Rh complexes of commercially available diphosphi- nes. Unfortunately, only about 10 different ones were then available to us and all of the tested ligands gave lower optical yields than bppm and the project was abandoned. 3.2. Random screening When we re-started our work a few years later, we could choose from among many more com- mercially available diphosphines. Therefore, we decided to carry out a new screening program to find a more selective catalyst. All parameters that in our experience have an influence on the catalyst performance were varied: Rb complexes of 7 dif- ferent classes of diphosphines (see Table 1), three solvents (methanol, toluene and a l:l mix- ture of methanol/toluene) and 4 different reaction conditions (25 and 50; 20 and 80 bar Hz pres- sure). In order to get some insight into the effect of the substrate structure, we tested not only ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (1) and ethyl pyruvate (2) but also ethyl benzoylformate and 2-oxo-4- phenylbutyric acid. Testing all possible 356 com- binations was not feasible. Therefore, we performed about 30 experiments using random combinations of the variables under standard con- ditions. A few additional experiments were carried out in order to confirm some of the observed results. The optical yields obtained for substrates (l) and (2) are reported in Table 1 (for the com- plete results see [7] ). Effect of the ligand on enantioselectivity Most of the enantioselectivities obtained in this screening program were in line with results reported for other Rh catalysts in the literature [8,9]. However, the high enantioselectivity of [Rh(nbd)C1]2/(2S; 3S)-norphos was unex- pected because 1,2-diphosphines (5-membered metallocycle) were reported to give low rates and ee's [9]. For substrate (1) 91% ee (50; meth- anol) and for (2) 89% ee (RT; MeOH/tol l'l) were obtained. Also remarkable was the high sub- strate specificity: only aliphatic a-ketoesters were hydrogenated with good optical yields. Those observed for aromatic a-ketoesters and for a- ketoacids were low (not shown). 3.3. Systematic variations Next, the effects of solvent, additives, s/c ratio, pressure and temperature for the [Rh(nbd)Cl] 2/ norphos catalyst in the hydrogenation of (1) was studied in more detail. The goal of these investi- gations was not only to improve the enantioselec- tivity but also to get a first indication of how the activity was affected. Important results are sum- marized in Table 2. Effect of the solvent on enantioselectivity and activity For the Rh-norphos catalyst, the solvent had a rather unexpected and dramatic effect on both cri- teria. For substrate (1) we observed a large decrease in conversion and even a reversal of the absolute configuration when changing from tolu- ene to methanol! The use of the cationic Rh/nor- phos-BF4 catalyst in methanol caused a significant drop in both the activity and the enan- tioselectivity. While alcohols had a positive effect on both rate and ee, water or small amounts of an amine were detrimental. These results are quite different from those described for the hydrogen- ation of ketones where neutral Rh catalysts in aprotic solvents usually give the highest optical yields [ 8,10,11 ]. For acetophenone in methanol, neutral and cationic Rh catalysts gave comparable results [ 11 ]. The effect of other reaction parameters The effect of other reaction parameters on the enantioselectivity of the hydrogenation of ( 1 ) by Rh-norphos can be summarized as follows: As expected, an increase in temperature led to higher conversions but lowered the optical yields. The hydrogen pressure did not significantly affect the enantioselectivity in the hydrogenation of (2) 88 H.-U. Blaser et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A.\" Chemical 107 (1996) 85-94 M.

Unfortunately, the s/c ratio (or the catalyst concentration) had an unusually strong effect on the enantioselectivity of the Rh-norphos catalyst. The best optical yields (ee 96%, MeOH, 25) were obtained with s/c = 50 but decreased to 86% with s/c = 800. Only a few studies have dealt with the effect of the s/c ratio on the optical yields [ 12,13 ] but usually the effect is not very strong. Also the activity of the neutral [Rh(nbd)C1]2/ (2S; 3S)-norphos catalyst in alcoholic solvents was not quite satisfactory: at s/c ratios > 200 high pressures ( > 50 bar H2) and high temperatures were necessary in order to get a reasonable reac- tion time. 3.4. Conclusions for the homogeneous system The investigation was stopped at this point. The main reason for this decision was that the s/c ratio of the Rh/norphos catalysts could not be increased without detrimental effect on the enan- tioselectivity making this catalytic system too expensive for commercial application (see below). On the positive side, the complex gener- ated in situ from [Rh(nbd)C1]2 and norphos is among the most selective catalysts for the hydro- genation of aliphatic a-ketoesters [14]. Since both enantiomers of norphos are available, this represents an efficient small scale synthesis for aliphatic (R)-and (S)-a-hydroxyesters. 4. Heterogeneous system The situation for chiral heterogeneous catalysts was very different when we started in 1983. Only two catalytic systems with useful enantioselectiv- ities were described in the literature: Pt-catalysts, modified with cinchona alkaloids for a-ketoesters [15] and Raney nickel, modified with tartaric acid/NaBr for/3-ketoesters [ 16]. In the case of the Pt system, only two modifiers were described to give the desired (R)-a-hydroxyesters prefer- entially: cinchonidine and quinine, fortunately both are available commercially. We learnt very early that the nature of the sup- ported Pt catalyst was a decisive factor in repro- ducing the good results reported by Orito et al. [15]. In contrast to well defined soluble metal complexes, a heterogeneous hydrogenation cata- lyst cannot be characterized on a molecular level. Rather, its properties have to be controlled by the type of support and the details of its preparation. Indeed, it took us years to find commercially awtil- able catalysts, the proper activating protocols and reaction conditions that enabled us to hydrogenate ethyl pyruvate with the same or better optical yields as Orito.

Re|adve and absolute configuration of the modified cinchona alkaloid derivatives. naturally occuring cinchona alkaloids X=H Y = OH R1 = CH=CH2 pyruvate as model substrate has been summarized [17]. In the following paragraphs, certain aspects of the development of a heterogeneous technical process will briefly be discussed. Proprietary interests preclude a more detailed discussion of the results obtained for ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4- phenylbutyrate (1). Instead, important effects are described for ethyl pyruvate (2) as substrate that shows a similar behavior. 4.1. Effect of individual elements of the catalytic system Pt catalysts Several investigations [ 15,18,19 ] showed that only Pt catalysts (on supports such as alumina, carbon or silica) gave good enantioselectivities for the hydrogenation of a-ketoesters. Rh and Ir [ 20] gave moderate ee' s, Pd, Ru and Ni were not effective. In our experience 5% Pt/AI203 catalysts showed the best overall performance. Since many different types are available commercially, we decided to identify important catalyst parameters for the enantioselectivity of the Pt-cinchona sys- tem. These investigations resulted in the following conclusions [21]: The platinum dispersion should be < 0.2 in order to obtain high optical yields. The texture of the support generally had a limited influence but aluminas with relatively low SBE'r, high pore volume and rather large pores were preferred. The method of catalyst prepara- tion (impregnation, reduction) had a strong influ- ence on both activity and enantioselectivity. We had already chosen the commercial catalyst E 4759 (Engelhard) as our standard reference catalyst (as a matter of fact, we still use this type for our ongoing mechanistic investigations). Fromthe results summarized above, a second type was developed in collaboration with Johnson Matthey: the type 5 R 94. A comparison showed that 5 R 94 had about the same dispersion as the E 4759 but a larger pore volume and larger average pore diameters. 5 R 94 showed a consistently higher enantioselectivity and turnover frequency for the hydrogenation of both ethyl pyruvate (2) and ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (1) [ 22 ]. This type was finally the catalyst of choice for a tech- nical hydrogenation process. Influence of the modifier structure We tried to find other types of modifiers such as different alkaloids [23] and simple chiral amines [24] but the results were so disappointing that we turned to modifying the cinchona mole- cules (see Fig. 2). The following results were important [22]: If N~ was alkylated, optical induction was lost com- pletely. Changes of X and Y (H, OH, C1, Br, OAc) resulted in most cases in lower optical yields, but modifiers derived from cinchonidine always gave excess of ethyl (R)-lactate, whereas modifiers derived from cinchonine always gave excess of ethyl (S)-lactate. The best results were obtained with HCd and MeOHCd were X = H, Y = OH and OCH3, respectively. Hydrogenation of the quin- oline nucleus led to lower enantioselectivities. We have found that some ring hydrogenation does indeed occur under our reaction conditions, but it H.-U.

The nature of R1 had little effect on the optical yield but we showed that the double bond of cinchonidine is hydrogenated very fast. For the process development, 10,11-dihydro- cinchonidine ( HCd) and O-methyl-lO,11-dihy- drocinchonidine (MeOHCd) were chosen as modifiers. ograms were produced in a 500 1 autoclave. The progress of the optimization can best be demon- strated by a plot of the optical yields versus the experiment number in the different development phases (see Fig. 3). From this plot, the effect of various measures can be seen that improved the ee's and -just as important - that led to a stable selectivity. This means that the process was no longer very sensitive to the variations. Solvent effects It was well known that the solvent has very strong effects both for the nickel-tartrate [ 16] as well as the Pt-cinchona system [ 15]. This was confirmed in a solvent screening for the hydro- genation of a-ketoesters (1) and (2) [25]. The best optical yields were found for aromatic sol- vents like benzene or toluene. For toxicological reasons we chose toluene as solvent for the pro- duction process. Due to new information, we looked at solvents and additives once more a few years later and found that acetic acid was by far the best solvent, giving optical yields of 92% for ( 1 ) and of 95 % for (2) (catalyst 5 R 94, modifier MeOHCd) [26]. 4.2. Optimization and final production process In about two years the production process was developed and scaled up. 1987 a few hundred kil- 4.3. Effect of substrate quality This is the last topic that will be addressed in some detail. It is a very sensitive topic and very seldom documented in the literature even though it is well known that small quantities of impurities can affect a catalytic process dramatically. In most cases, the analytical identification of the 'culprit' is not possible and quality control is extremely difficult. The enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters proved to be rather sensitive to the origin of the substrate. Table 3 lists initial rates and optical yields obtained for individual batches of ethyl pyruvate from different suppliers tested as received and distilled. The results for individual batches can be compared using the average for rate and ee - and the differences are remarkable: rateav ranged from 0.02 to 0.78 moles/g cat/min and eeav from 73 to 87%!

Auxiliary (est.) 50 000-600 000 1000-2000 1000--6000 300 yield (difference of best and worst ee) are most pronounced for the undistilled material. This is no surprise, but for some batches the improvement achieved by distillation is very small. The varia- tions are diminished at higher pressure and less pronounced in EtOH and in acetic acid. These results are not very encouraging for a stable pro- duction process and indeed similar problems had to be solved for substrate (2). 5. Comparison of the two catalytic systems 5.1. Catalyst costs For a batch process using chiral noble metal catalysts the catalyst costs are a decisive factor for the process economy. These consist of the follow- ing cost elements: (1) Metal. This is usually treated as an investment, i.e., only the interest costs are taken into account and these depend on the recovery time cycle. The prices for the noble metals vary strongly. (2) Metal losses. Losses occur both in the process (including handling, chemical and filtration losses) and during recov- ery by the catalyst supplier. Process and handling losses in the range of 1 to 10% are considered normal. Recovery losses for Pt are 1-2%, for Rh ca. 10%. (3) Catalyst preparation. This includes the costs for the support or ligands etc. and are prices for technical quantities. (4) Metal recov- ery. The Pt or Rh in the filtration or distillation residue has to be extracted, purified and trans- formed to the noble metal. Costs vary strongly with the nature of the residue and the metal con- centration. (5) Chiral auxiliary. These costs H.-U. Blaser et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 107 (1996) 85-94 93 Table 5 Comparison of various performance criteria for the enantioselective hydrogenation of a-ketoesters with Rh-norphos and Pt-cinchona catalysts. Catalyst costs were calculated per kg hydroxyester Homogeneous Heterogeneous catalyst catalyst Enantioselectivity 96% 80% (92%) Solvent EtOH, MeOH toluene (acetic acid) Catalyst loading s/c 100 0.5% w/w 5% Pt/ At203 Chiral auxiliary Rh:PP 1:1 0.03% w/w HCd (MeOHCd) Reaction time 20 h 3-5 h p, T 20-100 bar, RT 70 bar, RT Catalyst separation not developed filtration (HCd not (distillation?) removed ) Handling oxygen sensitive no special precaution Process stability not known substrate quality crucial Catalyst costs ($/kg) 140--400 1-2 depend very much on the scale of its preparation. The costs given in Table 4 are for commercially available gram amounts (e.g., Fluka, Strem, TCI etc.) and an estimate for the production of a few hundred kilograms. 5.2. Performance Table 5 gives some important criteria to com- pare the performance of the two catalytic systems. In terms of selectivity, the homogeneous Rh-nor- phos is clearly superior to the heterogeneous Pt- cinchona catalyst. Because enrichment to > 99% ee is relatively easy in a later stage of the synthesis of benazepril, this deficiency is not so important. The decisive factor for preferring the heteroge- neous catalyst in this particular case was of course the catalyst costs. Other problems that often arise with homogeneous catalysts such as handling and separation were not investigated in this case. 6. Experimental Materials and methods used for the homoge- neous catalysts are described in detail in [ 7 ], those for the Pt-cinchona systems in [ 18,21,26]. The experiments with the different batches of ethyl pyruvate were carried out in a 50 ml autoclave loaded with 50 mg 5% Pt/A1203 (pretreated for 4h at 400 under H2), 10 mg HCd, 10 ml ethyl pyruvate and 20 ml solvent (puriss). The ethyl pyruvate was used as received or freshly distilled over a 20 cm Vigreux column at 8 mbar, bath temperature 40-50, the fraction boiling between 26 and 28 was collected. References [1] R.A.

A case study concerning the development of enantioselective hydrogenation processes for aliphatic α-ketoesters, particularly ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (1) and ethyl pyruvate (2), using homogeneous Rh-diphosphine and heterogeneous Pt/Al2O3-cinchona catalysts is presented. Important parameters to obtain high enantioselectivities using the homogeneous system were shown to be the ligand, the nature of the Rh complex and the solvent. Unfortunately, the best optical yields (ee 96%) were achieved only at a low substrate/catalyst ratio of s/c=50. For the heterogeneous system, the structure and concentration of the modifier, the nature and pretreatment of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the type of solvent and the hydrogen pressure were decisive for high enantioselectivity (ee's up to 95%). A major problem was the effect of the substrate quality on rate and optical yield. A comparison of catalyst costs showed a significant advantage for the heterogeneous catalyst, mainly due to its very high activity and catalyst productivity.
