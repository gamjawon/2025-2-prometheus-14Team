Ruthenium oxide was easily reduced to the metal in a hydrogen stream at room temperature, irrespective of the presence of any alumina support. SnO supported on alumina was not reduced to Sn metal in a hydrogen stream at temperatures below 513 K, even in the presence of ruthenium. Ruthenium/tin/alumina catalysts with different oxidation states of ruthenium and tin were prepared and tested in the hydrogenation of ethyl phenylacetate to 2-phenylethanol. it was proved that the catalyst does not always need to be activated in a hydrogen stream at a high temperature. The ruthenium component of the catalyst transforms easily to zero oxidation state. However, tin retains its original oxidation state. The oxidation state of tin determines the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of ethyl phenylacetate to 2-phenylethanol. The Sn(II) is found to be the optimum oxidation state for the formation of 2-phenylethanol. ~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

When the formation compared to Catalyst 1. On the other hand, actual oxidation states of tin in the catalyst were zero when raw materials of the catalyst were metal acetate or four, the conversion and selectivity were quite low.

The explanation of the low Therefore, Sn(II) is the active oxidation state. Tahara selectivity of Catalyst 7 is as follows. During heating et al. reported that the Ru/Sn/A1203 catalyst showed of Ru(NO)(NO3)3/A1203 in an argon stream, orange- high adsorption ability for oxygen molecules but low colored NOx gas, that originated from Ru(NO)(NO3)3, ability for hydrogen molecules.

They concluded that tin shows higher affinity partially oxidized to SnO2 by the remaining NOx gas. to oxygen molecules than ruthenium does [29]. Thus, Therefore, it is expected that Catalyst 7 has much the Sn(II) species attracts and activates the carboxyl lower selectivity than Catalyst 1.

Tel.: +81 298 54 4631; fax: +81 298 54 4709 The redox behavior of ruthenium and tin oxides unsupported and supported on alumina was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. Ruthenium oxide was easily reduced to the metal in a hydrogen stream at room temperature, irrespective of the presence of any alumina support. SnO supported on alumina was not reduced to Sn metal in a hydrogen stream at temperatures below 513 K, even in the presence of ruthenium. Ruthenium/tin/alumina catalysts with different oxidation states of ruthenium and tin were prepared and tested in the hydrogenation of ethyl phenylacetate to 2-phenylethanol. It was proved that the catalyst does not always need to be activated in a hydrogen stream at a high temperature. The ruthenium component of the catalyst transforms easily to zero oxidation state. However, tin retains its original oxidation state. The oxidation state of tin determines the activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of ethyl phenylacetate to 2-phenylethanol. The Sn(II) is found to be the optimum oxidation state for the formation of 2-phenylethanol.
