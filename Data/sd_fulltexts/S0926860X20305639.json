Graphical abstract Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are of hazardous atmospheric contaminants that can cause substantial harmful effects on human and environment. Herein, highly active composite catalysts of VOx supported on Al-Ti mixed oxide were prepared by a sol-gel process followed by a wet-impregnation method, and they were investigated for catalytic combustion of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as representative CVOCs. The VOx/Al-Ti mixed oxide composite catalysts showed the highly active and stable performance toward the catalytic oxidation of DCE, as compared with the corresponding single metal oxides or Al-Ti mixed oxides. Considering the characterization analysis combined with the catalytic performance results, both acidic property of Al-Ti mixed oxides and redox feature of VOx catalysts seem to play critical roles in the complete oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane. The strategy of catalyst design developed in this work may provide the way for exploitation of earth-abundant, nonprecious and efficient composite catalysts for catalytic CVOCs removal processes. Keywords Chlorinated VOCs Catalytic combustion 1,2-dichloroethane Dehydrochlorination Mixed metal oxide 1 Introduction With emerging environmental pollution issues, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have gained significant attention as critical air pollutants [1,2]. Especially, Cl-containing VOCs (CVOCs) are much more toxic and difficult to deal with than common VOCs [3,4]. CVOCs are emitted to the environment from various sources such as industrial plant, transportation, domestic fuel use, etc. [4]. These CVOCs give rise to several symptoms of illness and disease when directly exposed to human, and they may cause serious photochemical reactions with other emitted pollutants (e.g., SOx, NOx) [3]. Catalytic combustion methods are most widely used to remove CVOCs because of their relatively low operating temperature and high selectivity toward non-toxic species [3]. Different types of catalysts for CVOCs removal can be categorized as supported noble metals [5–8], zeolites [9–14], metal oxides [15–40]. In the case of noble metal catalysts, they suffer from several drawbacks of high cost with scarcity and poor tolerance against poisonous intermediates such as adsorbed Cl species formed during the oxidation reactions (Cl-poisoning). Zeolites are relatively cheap catalytic materials and their structure and acidity could be easily controlled, however, diversity of byproducts and deactivation issue caused by coke deposition should be overcome. Perovskites or spinel structure ceramics have remarkable thermal/structural stability and resistivity to coke deposition or Cl-poisoning, but they appear to be active for the CVOCs oxidation at relatively high reaction temperatures [15–18]. In contrast, transition metal oxides or their composites have drawn attention because of cheap, excellent stability, reasonable activity and selectivity even at the relatively low temperature, as a number of metal oxide composite catalysts have been investigated for the catalytic CVOCs removal reactions [19,16–40]. (1) C2H4Cl2 → C2H3Cl + HCl (2) C2H3Cl → C2H2 + HCl (3) C2H3Cl + O2 → H2O + COx + HCl (4) C2H2 + O2 → H2O + COx As previously reported, catalytic combustion reaction of CVOCs proceeds via cleavage of C-Cl bond on the acid site with release of HCl molecule (i.e., dehydrochlorination reactions (1) and (2)) and residual intermediates are adsorbed on the surface of catalyst [5,19–22]. Then, the adsorbed intermediates are further decomposed to H2O, COx and HCl by the reactions with oxygen species present on surface or in lattice of the composite oxide catalysts (i.e., oxidation reactions (3) and (4)) [22]. In this sense, the requirements of oxide-based catalysts for CVOCs removal should possess both of proper acidity and excellent reducibility. To satisfy these requirements, a myriad of composite catalysts have been explored as a promising solution [5–7,12–14,32–34,39,41]. Among the metal oxides, it is well known that alumina and titania are the most commonly encountered supports for the active metal catalysts [5–7,23–25]. These support materials show sufficient textural properties for efficient deposition of active components and good stability under the reaction condition. Moreover, their acidic and redox properties can be enhanced by forming mixed oxides [26–31,41]. When Al3+ and Ti4+ oxides are mixed in a same crystal structure, oxygen vacancies are easily formed as extrinsic defects to maintain electroneutrality of the crystal structure, and these oxygen vacancies can attribute to various physicochemical and catalytic properties of the material. Furthermore, the introduction of additional species with oxidizing ability is an effective strategy for improving reducibility of catalysts [12–14,20,22,24,25,32–34,39]. Therefore, we hypothesized that hybridization of an active catalytic component showing a high redox property and Al-Ti mixed oxide with a controlled acidity could boost the catalytic activity for the complete oxidation reactions of CVOCs molecules. Among transition metal oxides, vanadium oxide was chosen as the active catalytic material, which can be easily reduced with various oxidation states such as V5+ and V4+ oxides. In this paper, a series of Al-Ti mixed oxides were prepared by a typical sol-gel method and VOx was deposited on the Al-Ti mixed oxides by a wet impregnation method. The resulting composite catalysts revealed a highly active performance for the complete oxidation of 1,2–dichloroethane (DCE), which was selected as representative CVOCs. The Al-Ti mixed oxides showed better performances on the catalytic oxidation of DCE than single oxides of AlOx or TiOx due to their improved acidity and reducibility. Furthermore, VOx supported on the Al-Ti mixed oxide in form of Al1Ti1Ox (VOx/Al-Ti mixed oxide catalysts) exhibited much active, selective and stable performances toward the catalytic complete oxidation of DCE than the Al-Ti mixed oxide without VOx. Its high catalytic performance can be attributed to synergistic effect associated with abundant acid sites of Al-Ti mixed oxide and effective incorporation of VOx on the mixed oxide materials with an enhanced reducibility. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Al-Ti mixed oxides The Al-Ti mixed oxides with different compositions in forms of AlmTinOx (m:n = 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 0:1) were synthesized using a typical sol-gel method. Total moles of metals in the synthesized oxides were fixed to 0.2 mol. Pre-mixed solvent solution was prepared using 4.88 mL of acetylacetone (Sigma Aldrich, ≥ 99 %) and 181 mL of 2-propanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5 %) and calculated amount of aluminum-tri-sec-butoxide (Sigma Aldrich, 97 %) was added in the solution, and then vigorously stirred for 0.5 h. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Sigma Aldrich, 97 %) was dissolved with continuous stirring for 0.5 h, followed by adding 7.87 mL of 0.5 M nitric acid. The mixture was heated at 80 °C with stirring for 2 days in order to form viscous gel and evaporate solvent, and resultants were calcined in air atmosphere at 600 °C for 5 h to obtain the Al-Ti mixed oxides. For a uniform particle size distribution of the prepared catalysts, all Al-Ti mixed oxides were grinded and sieved to 60–100 mesh (0.15−0.25 mm). 2.2 Preparation of VOx loaded Al-Ti mixed oxide catalysts Loading of VOx on the Al-Ti mixed oxide (with composition of Al/Ti = 1) was carried out using a wet impregnation method, followed by a calcination treatment. Calculated amounts of NH4VO3 (Sigma Aldrich, ≥ 99 %) and oxalic acid dihydrate (SAMCHUN, 99 %) (molar ratio = 1:2) were dissolved in DI water. Then, this precursor solution was mixed with the Al-Ti mixed oxide and sonicated for 0.5 h to allow the V species to be impregnated, and then dried overnight at 80 °C to evaporate solvent. The loading amount of VOx was fixed to be 5 wt% of total catalyst based on a vanadium oxide phase of V2O5. The resulting powder was calcined in air atmosphere at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain VOx/Al-Ti mixed oxide catalyst (hereafter, denoted as VOx/Al-Ti). For comparison, a single oxide of bulk VOx was synthesized without employing the Al-Ti mixed oxide under the same experimental condition. 2.3 Physicochemical characterizations of catalysts The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of prepared catalysts were obtained on Bruker D2 PHASER equipment using a Cu Ka radiation source X-ray. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment, in which the specific surface area and mesopore volume were calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods. The NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were performed on MicrotracBEL BELCAT-II equipment. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on ThermoFisherScientific K-ALPHA+ equipment (All of the XPS data were calibrated based on C 1s spectra). 2.4 Measurement of catalytic performances Catalytic oxidation of DCE was carried out in a quartz tube fixed-bed flow reactor. DCE vapor was generated from a jacketed glass saturator at 15 °C and carried by a dry air at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1 then diluted with two additional dry air flows of 12 and 86 mL min−1. The resultant reaction feed was composed of 100 mL min−1 dry air with 1000 ppmv DCE. 100 mg of the prepared catalyst was loaded on quartz wool set in the center of the quartz tube reactor, therefore, the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed to 60,000 mL h−1 gcat −1. The catalyst was exposed to the feed stream at 150 °C for 1 h to reach adsorption-desorption equilibrium before the measurement of catalytic performances. The catalytic oxidation reaction was carried out from 200 to 500 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C min-1 in a 50 °C interval step mode with a 0.5 h plateau for each temperature step. For each reaction condition, experimental data were measured 3 or 4 times and their average values were used with error bars to represent the catalytic performances. The stability test was also performed at 500 °C for 10 h, after the activity test. All of the effluent streams were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography equipment (GC, Agilent 7890A) quantitatively with flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and qualitatively with mass selective detector (MSD, Agilent 5977B). The carbon balance was checked for the catalytic reactions by using the two detectors of FID and TCD, which was well maintained during the DCE oxidation reaction (Table S1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of the catalysts Textural properties were investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, as summarized in Table 1 . VOx/Al-Ti catalyst showed relatively smaller surface area and pore volume as compared with the Al-Ti mixed oxide of Al1Ti1Ox, indicating that incorporation of vanadium oxide significantly affected the pore structure of the Al-Ti mixed oxide support, which caused a little decrease of surface area of support material. It was observed that the specific surface areas and pore volumes of single metal oxides such as TiOx and VOx are significantly smaller than those of Al-Ti mixed oxides, except AlOx. XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1 . The AlOx has γ-Al2O3 phase with amorphous feature, whereas TiOx consists of both rutile and anatase structure with high crystallinity. With a little amount of Al for the Al-Ti mixed oxide such as Al1Ti3Ox, the crystalline features seemed to be diminished, but some of anatase structured TiO2 still remained. Notably, the Al-Ti mixed oxides such as Al3Ti1Ox and Al1Ti1Ox showed amorphous features as the increased addition of Al could significantly hinder the growth of crystal structure of TiO2 and thus form extremely small sizes of crystal particles, which are out of detection resolution of the XRD [35,36]. These results are associated with the previous BET isotherm results in that the Al3Ti1Ox exhibited the larger surface area than those of the single metal oxides. The VOx/Al-Ti catalyst also revealed an amorphous nature even after the VOx deposition on the Al-Ti mixed oxide since the VOx would be highly dispersed on the Al1Ti1Ox. The Raman spectra revealed the presence of VOx species in the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst (Fig. S1). To investigate acidic property of the prepared catalysts, NH3-TPD experiments were carried out (Fig. 2 ) and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. Broad NH3 desorption peaks were obtained for most Al-containing catalysts whereas the single metal oxides of TiOx and VOx showed no obvious NH3 desorption peaks, implying that the latter materials should not possess any acidic sites on the surface which can interact with NH3 molecules. The two NH3 desorption peaks appeared at lower and higher temperatures in the Al-containing catalysts could be associated with the relatively weak and strong acid sites of catalysts, respectively. Accordingly, the relative amounts of acid sites can be compared by integrated calculation of each deconvoluted peak areas. For comparison, the total amount of acidic sites presented in the AlOx and titrated by NH3 adsorption was referenced to an arbitrary number of 100. In the cases of Al-Ti mixed oxides, the strength and proportion of strong acid site appear to increase but total amount of acid sites seems to be decreased as the Al/Ti ratio decreases. The VOx/Al-Ti catalyst displays almost similar levels of amount and strength of acid sites to those of Al-Ti mixed oxide with Al1Ti1Ox, indicating that the acidity of support material is well maintained even after the VOx deposition. H2-TPR was performed to examine reducibility property of the catalysts (Fig. 3 ) and the total H2 consumption amounts of catalysts were summarized in Table 1. The AlOx showed negligible signal for reduction process with H2 over the entire temperature range, suggesting negligible reducibility [28]. The Al-Ti mixed oxides exhibited significant amounts of H2 consumption as compared with AlOx. Although Al3Ti1Ox and Al1Ti3Ox showed similar amounts of H2 consumption, the H2-TPR peak of Al1Ti3Ox appeared to be positioned at the lower temperature range compared with that of Al3Ti1Ox. Interestingly, the Al1Ti1Ox indicated the largest amount of H2 consumption among the Al-Ti mixed oxides and the H2-TPR peak of Al1Ti1Ox could be deconvoluted into two peaks. The former peak is located at slightly higher temperature than Al1Ti3Ox and the latter peak is located at lower temperature than Al3Ti1Ox, suggesting that Al1Ti1Ox has the mixed composite characteristic because of its middle value of Al/Ti ratio. Notably, the VOx exhibited an incomparably large amount of H2 consumption because vanadia has remarkable reducibility [20,25]. Therefore, when the vanadia was deposited on the Al1Ti1Ox catalyst (VOx/Al-Ti catalyst), the H2 consumption amount was increased by at least two folds as compared to Al1Ti1Ox along with shift of H2-TPR peaks to the lower temperatures. These results could suggest that the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst possesses an excellent redox property at the relatively low temperature range. Atomic compositions and their chemical bonding environment on the surface of catalysts were determined by XPS measurements (Fig. 4 and summarized in Tables 2 and 3 ). It is clearly observed that the binding energies of Al 2p and Ti 2p of Al1Ti1Ox were decreased compared with those of single oxides because of charge transfer from oxygen vacancies to Al and Ti species (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 4A, the deconvolution of O 1s spectra reveals that the two peaks appeared at lower and higher binding energy are associated with lattice and surface oxygen species, respectively [26–28,37,38]. In contrast, AlOx indicated lattice oxygen species-dominant O 1s spectrum. V 2p3/2 XPS spectra of fresh and used VOx/Al-Ti catalysts are represented in Fig. 4B, in which the peaks can be divided into V5+ peak (517.3 eV) and V4+ peak (515.8 eV). The vanadium atom can exist with various oxidation states [20,25], suggesting that the remarkable redox property of VOx could contribute to the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst. This is also in a good agreement with the previous H2-TPR results. 3.2 Catalytic oxidation performances The results of catalytic combustion of DCE over the prepared catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 . The product gas stream was analyzed by GC-FID and GC–MS, resulted in that no other hydrocarbon molecules were produced except vinylchloride and acetylene. The AlOx exhibited the highest conversions of DCE from the temperatures of 300 °C. However, substantial amounts of byproducts were produced over the AlOx, which are of intermediates before being converted to the complete oxidation products of CO2, H2O and HCl. The main byproducts, such as vinylchloride (C2H3Cl) and acetylene (C2H2), could be obtained by two step dehydrochlorination reactions of DCE. First, dehydrochlorination of C2H4Cl2 to C2H3Cl starts to occur at a relatively low temperature [5,19–22]. And next, dehydrochlorination of C2H3Cl to C2H2 begins at 400 °C, but they are not completely converted to CO/CO2 until the reaction temperature reaches at 500 °C. It means that the single AlOx with moderate acidity and surface area has reasonable activity for DCE dehydrochlorination reactions (reactions (1) and (2)) but shows a limited activity toward the subsequent oxidation processes (reactions (3) and (4)) because it has negligible reducibility. For the cases of TiOx and VOx single oxides, although conversion of DCE shows quite low values than other catalysts, they are able to produce little amount of byproducts even the conversion was reached to 40 % at 500 °C. These observations could suggest that the reaction mechanism of DCE decomposition over the AlOx would be completely different from those of TiOx or VOx. On the other hand, the Al-Ti mixed oxides showed reasonable conversions of DCE with relatively little amounts of byproduct formation over the entire temperature range tested in this work. We chose the Al1Ti1Ox as support material because its catalytic activity for the oxidation reaction was highest among the Al-Ti mixed oxides tested here at the moderate temperature range of 350–400 °C. Notably, the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst showed higher conversion values of DCE as well as quite suppressed formation of byproducts as compared to the mixed oxides (Fig. 5). Especially, COx yield of Al-Ti catalyst is remarkably increased by incorporation of VOx at the moderate temperature range of 350–400 ℃ (Fig. S2). Considering that surface oxygen species located in vicinity of oxygen vacancies have superior mobility than lattice oxygen species, sufficient amount of surface oxygen species was responsible for the efficient oxidation of CVOCs. Accordingly, the Al-Ti mixed oxide of Al1Ti1Ox with higher Osur/Olat ratio showed better performance on the oxidation of DCE than other single oxides tested here, suggesting that surface oxygen species should greatly contribute in the oxidation. In comparison with fresh and used VOx/Al-Ti catalyst, the Osur/Olat ratio was decreased after the catalytic oxidation of DCE (Table 2), indicating that the surface oxygen species were consumed during the reaction [28,40]. Also, it can be considered that the adsorption of chlorine species on the oxygen vacancies (i.e., Cl-poisoning) might lead to decrease in the Osur/Olat ratio after the reaction [19,22,40]. However, adsorbed chlorine species can be removed by formation of HCl or Cl2 species under oxidative atmosphere, meaning that the Cl-poisoning step can be somewhat inhibited over the catalyst with excellent redox property [19,40]. From Table 3, the atomic ratio of surface chlorine species of used catalysts shows the following order: AlOx (0.8), Al1Ti1Ox (0.4), VOx/Al-Ti (0.08), which is similar tendency to the order of reducibility. From XPS analysis, the surface atomic ratio of V5+/V4+ decreased after the catalytic combustion of DCE, suggesting the V5+ species should be reduced to V4+ after the catalytic combustion of CVOCs (Table 2). This implied that the V5+-O-V5+ (highest oxidation state of VOx) is considered as active sites for oxidation of CVOCs [20,25]. The production of C2H3Cl occurs over Al-Ti mixed oxides and VOx/Al-Ti catalyst at the middle range temperature, which is decreased with increasing temperature. It is understood that the DCE reaction mechanism of Al-Ti mixed oxides and the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst probably consists of first dehydrochlorination, and followed by deep oxidation of intermediates. Compared to direct oxidation, the adsorbed intermediate oxidation proceeds readily [22], which explains why the oxidation performance of the individual TiOx and VOx oxide is inferior to the Al-Ti mixed oxides in spite of similar or higher reducibility. On the basis of the aforementioned results, we deduced that the high catalytic performance for complete oxidation of DCE over the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst was probably improved by the synergistic effect between VOx and Al-Ti mixed oxides. In brief, (1) Al1Ti1Ox composite provided the proper acidity with high surface area for VOx deposition; (2) the presence of introduced VOx with abundant valence state of V5+ gave efficient oxidation ability even at moderate temperatures. The stability tests were also performed at 500 °C for the several catalysts used in the activity tests (Fig. 6 ), in which the VOx/Al-Ti catalyst appeared to well maintained its activity over the tested reaction time with suppressed formation of byproducts. 4 Conclusions The VOx/Al-Ti catalyst showed highly active and stable performance for catalytic combustion of DCE. Al1Ti1Ox support provided strong and abundant acid sites, which should play important roles for the cleavage of C-Cl bond (dehydrochlorination), and introduction of VOx species onto the Al1Ti1Ox support affected reducibility for enhanced oxidizing ability. Surface oxygen species, which located around the oxygen vacancies, significantly increased not only the oxidation activity, but also the resistivity against Cl-poisoning. The strategy of catalyst design developed in this work can provide the way for exploitation of earth-abundant, nonprecious metal and efficient oxide composite catalysts for CVOCs removal processes.

        "dc:description": "Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) are of hazardous atmospheric contaminants that can cause substantial harmful effects on human and environment. Herein, highly active composite catalysts of VOx supported on Al-Ti mixed oxide were prepared by a sol-gel process followed by a wet-impregnation method, and they were investigated for catalytic combustion of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as representative CVOCs. The VOx/Al-Ti mixed oxide composite catalysts showed the highly active and stable performance toward the catalytic oxidation of DCE, as compared with the corresponding single metal oxides or Al-Ti mixed oxides. Considering the characterization analysis combined with the catalytic performance results, both acidic property of Al-Ti mixed oxides and redox feature of VOx catalysts seem to play critical roles in the complete oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane. The strategy of catalyst design developed in this work may provide the way for exploitation of earth-abundant, nonprecious and efficient composite catalysts for catalytic CVOCs removal processes.",
