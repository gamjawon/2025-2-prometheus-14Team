The effect of the solvent depends on the nature of the catalyst. When the clay is dried at 120 C the reaction is more efficient in solvents in which water is less soluble. However, when the clay is calcined at 500 C the basicity of the solvent plays a determining role. Both effects are different from those observed in non-catalysed reactions, where the acidity of the solvent is the most important factor. Key words: activation of catalyst; Diels-Alder reaction; montmorillonite; solvent effects; zinc Introduction Clays have been described as efficient catalysts for non-asymmetric [ 19 ] and asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions [ 10 ] . The influence of several factors in the model Diels-Alder reaction between methyl acrylate and cyclopentadiene, catalysed by Zn (II) and Fe (III) -doped K10 montmorillonites, has been studied [ 11 ] , showing that solvent plays a crucial role that is qualitatively related to its miscibility with water [ 12 ] . Therefore, it is interesting to determine whether, in heterogeneously-catalysed Diels-Alder reactions, a relationship exists between the nature of the catalyst and the solvent effect. In view of the fact that calcination is frequently used to modify heterogeneous catalysts, we have studied the influence of the solvent in the Diels-Alder reaction between methyl acrylate and cyclopentadiene catalysed by Zn (II) K10 montmorillonite dried at 120 C (henceforth called doped clay) and calcined at 500 C (Fig. 1). *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Experimental Preparation and characterization of the catalysts K10 montmorillonite was purchased from Aldrich. Cation exchange was performed by gradually adding K10 montmorillonite (10 g) to a stirred zinc chloride solution (125 ml, 1 M) at room temperature [ 5 ] . The suspension was stirred for 24 h, filtered and washed chloride-free with deionised water. The resulting solid was dried overnight on a thin bed at 120 C in an oven, and ground in a mortar. The catalyst was equilibrated over saturated salt solution in order to give a reproducible water content. Clay calcination was carried out in dry air (25-30 ml/min) using the following temperature programme: 24 C, 8 C/min, 120 C, 1 C/min, 500 C (5 h), -1 C/min, 40 C (1 h). Surface areas were calculated from BET nitrogen isotherms determined at 77 K. In both cases the values obtained fall within the range of 220-240 m2/ g. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Philips computer-driven Xray diffractometer using CuKal radiation. Both exchanged and calcined clays show the same X-ray diffraction spectrum, and the same crystallinity. Water contents were analyzed by thermogravimetry in a Perkin-Elmer TGS-2 apparatus equipped with a System 4 microprocessor controller. Acidic properties were determined by adsorption of pyridine as probe molecule on self-supported wafers. The wafers were compressed under 5 ton cm-2 pressure to obtain thin disks 18 mm in diameter with a weight of - 10 mg cm-2. The resulting wafers were placed in cells (equipped with KBr windows and connected via stopcocks to a vacuum line) where the treatment of the catalysts was performed. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 320 FT-IR spectrometer after desorption of pyridine at different temperatures. Reaction between methyl acrylate and cyclcopentadiene Preweighed, cation-exchanged montmorillonite was dried at 120 C overnight or calcined by the method described above. The flask was charged with the catalyst and solvent (15 ml) under an argon atmosphere at 20 C. Methyl acrylate (0.645 g, 7.5 mmol) and freshly distilled cyclopentadiene (1.485 g, 22.5 mmol) were added via a syringe. The reaction flask was shaken for 24 h and the reaction monitored by gas chromatography (FID, Hewlett-Packard 5890 II, cross-linked methyl silicone column 25 m X 0.2 mm X 0.33 ,um, helium carrier gas, 16 psi, injector temperature 230 C, detector temperature 250 C, oven temperature programme 50 0 C (3 min) - 25 C/min -100 0 C (9 min), C. Catiuiela et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 305-310 307 retention times: methyl acrylate 2.7 min, exo-cycloadduct 12.7 min, endo-cycloadduct 12.9 min). Results Table 1 gathers the results obtained in the clay-catalysed reactions and in the non-catalysed reactions carried out in the same solvents, together with some features of the solvents. Regression models with empirical solvent parameters have been used to account for the effect of the solvent in non-catalysed reactions [ 13-19 ] . However, when the reaction is carried out in the presence of a clay, there are two concurrent mechanisms of reaction, namely, the catalysed one and the noncatalysed one. The use of regression models is thus not justified in this case, and a qualitative analysis seems more suitable. First of all, the presence of a clay greatly modifies the influence of the solvent on the reaction results. In non-catalysed reactions the best results are obtained in the more acidic solvents, i.e. trifluoroethanol. In fact, very acidic reaction media have a catalytic effect on the Diels-Alder reactions of acrylates TABLE 1 Experimental results for the non-catalysed and clay-catalysed reactions between methyl acrylate and cyclopentadiene in several solvents Solvent Conversion at 30 mine endo/exoa,b ssf Solubility of water in the 1` 2d 3e 1` 2d 3e solvents dichloromethane 2.2 35.0 37.9 3.7 9.7 11.5 0.00 0.009 anisole 3.1 49.0 25.9 3.2 10.3 9.8 0.22 _< 0.005'' toluene 2.0 52.9 34.2 2.7 10.7 13.4 0.11 0.002 acetonitrile 2.2 2.5 2.5 4.3 4.5 5.2 0.31 ' diethyl ether 1.5 16.4 7.4 2.8 9.1 5.0 0.47 0.058 acetone 2.1 2.5 1.9 3.5 3.6 5.2 0.48 ' cyclohexanone 2.8 8.5 4.5 3.1 3.4 3.1 0.53 0.321 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol 16.4 43.0 31.0 7.3 7.8 8.2 0.00 ` quinoline 6.8 7.2 7.1 3.2 3.3 3.3 0.64 0.669 'Determined by gas chromatography, all the reactions have been repeated three times, and the results are reproduced within the experimental error. \"The endo/exo selectivity does not vary with time. `1=non-catalysed reaction. d2 = doped clay. e3 =calcined clay.

However, the presence of the clay gives better results in much less acidic solvents. When the calcined clay is used as a catalyst, a relationship between the solvent basicity (as described by the ss parameter) and the experimental results of endo/exo selectivity and rate (represented by the percentage of conversion at 30 min) can be clearly stated. In fact, the results obtained can be arranged in two different sets. The first one contains those results obtained in solvents of medium and high basicity. In this case, the presence of the clay does not greatly modify the results obtained with respect to those found in the noncatalysed reactions. It can be concluded that in these solvents the reaction takes place in all or to a great extent in the bulk of the solvent, and the calcined clay does not play a catalytic role. The second set contains those results obtained in solvents of low basicity, in which an important catalytic effect of the clay can be stated by comparing these results with those obtained in non-catalysed reactions. The particular behaviour of trifluoroethanol deserves special mention. In this solvent the clay plays a catalytic role, as can be seen by the increase in rate. However, only a moderate increase in endo/exo selectivity is observed. This indicates that an important part of the reaction takes place in the bulk of the solvent, because of the above-mentioned catalytic effect of this solvent. The infrared spectrum of pyridine adsorbed on wafers of clay and desorbed at 120 C (Fig. 2) shows that Zn (II) K10 montmorillonite, simply dried at oven temperature, contains both Lewis and Bronsted acidity. In the calcination process, water and Bronsted acidity are removed, as shown by the disap- r Calcined v CO Doped 1750 1525 1300 cm-1 Fig. 2.

There is also a diminution of the band of pyridine coordinated to Lewis sites, which might be the result of the reaction of some Zn (II) ions with the clay, forming an aluminate. The remaining Lewis acid sites, however, retain pyridine after evacuation at 500 C, and then appear as strongly acid sites. As a consequence, the calcined clay behaves as a Lewis acid and its catalytic activity derives from this acidity. The relationship between solvent basicity and the catalytic activity of calcined clays can be rationalised in terms of coordination of the solvent to the above-mentioned Lewis acid sites of the clay, which prevents the coordination of the dienophile to these sites. In a previous paper [ 12 r we reported a qualitative relationship between the results obtained in doped clay-catalysed reactions and the miscibility of the organic solvent with water. This result was related to a relevant role of the pools of water present in the clay. Therefore, the effect of the solvent on these reactions can be related to its ability to remove the internal water of solvation, represented by the solubility of water in the organic solvent (Table 1). As can be seen from Table 1, the worst results in doped clay-catalysed reactions are generally obtained in solvents which are capable of dissolving a significant amount of water, including cycloheganone. Trifluoroethanol is an exception to the rule and, in spite of its miscibility with water in all proportions, the results obtained are very close to those obtained with calcined clays. This result indicates that the ability to dissolve water is not the only characteristic of the solvent that determines its role in doped clay-catalysed DielsAlder reactions. When solvents which are not able to dissolve a significant amount of water are considered, there are two main differences between the results obtained with calcined and doped clays. The first, and more important, is the catalytic effect of the doped clay in diethyl ether, where the endo/exo selectivity is similar to those obtained in toluene, anisole or dichloromethane. Secondly, whereas dichloromethane is a more suitable solvent than anisole in reactions catalysed by the calcined clay, the opposite is true when the doped clay is used as a catalyst. These results show that in these solvents the basicity does not play any significant role when the doped clay is used as a catalyst. Further confirmation of this hypothesis might be achieved by carrying out the reactions in solvents of high basicity and hydrophobicity. Unfortunately, there is an intrinsic correlation between basicity and hydrophobicity, since the basic solvents are also hygroscopic because of hydrogen bond donor-hydrogen bond acceptor interactions between the hydrogens of water and the basic centres of the solvent. However, a comparison of the results obtained in diethyl ether and acetone seems to confirm the above-mentioned hypothesis. In fact, in spite of the similar basicity of both solvents, much better results are obtained in the less hygroscopic diethyl ether. To sum up, solvents that are both basic and hygroscopic are not suitable for doped clay-catalysed Diels-Alder reactions. It may be suggested that these 310 C. Catiuiela et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 305-310 solvents remove the internal pools of water of the clay and coordinate the Lewis acid sites; in this way both Bronsted and Lewis acidity are eliminated. It can be concluded that the basicity of the solvent plays an important role in clay-catalysed Diels-Alder reactions, which agrees with previous observations in clay-catalysed Claisen reactions [ 21 ] , but with doped clays the hygroscopicity of the solvent is also a critical feature. Thus, the effect of the solvent in clay-catalysed Diels-Alder reactions, and probably in most of the heterogeneously-catalysed reactions, depends on the nature of the catalyst.
