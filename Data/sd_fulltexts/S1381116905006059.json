Graphical abstract The monobenzoylation of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol in the presence of different tin reagents has been studied. When 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol is reacted with a tin oxide or a tin ketal, the corresponding tin ketal is formed. This proved to be the actual catalyst in the benzoylation reaction. The monobenzoylation of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol in the presence of different tin reagent has been studied. The stannylene ketal of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol has been prepared and used as a catalyst or generated in situ by exchange with other mixed tin ketals. In either case, the acylation occurs rapidly with 2mol% of the catalyst with the known selectivity. These experiments clearly establish the catalytic nature of the acylation reaction. Keywords Tin ketals Diols Monoacylation catalysis 1 Introduction Tin mediation in the monofunctionalisation of polyols allows to reach two main objectives: high regioselectivity and rate enhancement. In compounds containing three or more hydroxyl groups, the regioselectivity is the prevalent aspect of the reaction and it has been applied in the selective functionalisation of carbohydrates [1]. In compounds containing two hydroxyl groups functionalisation at the primary hydroxyl group prevails, but opposite selectivity can be eventually obtained with a particular reaction protocol [2]. In all cases, tin mediated reactions are much faster than reactions in normal conditions. In fact, oxygen atoms in the intermediate stannylene ketals are activated toward the nucleophilic attack on the acylating agent. When the acylating agent is an acid chloride, after the first functionalisation the tin ligand becomes chlorinated and loses its activation preventing further reaction. The literature concerning tin mediated acylations and alkylations describes a variety of experimental conditions without specifying when a catalytic cycle can be active. Most reactions with dibutyl tin oxide (Bu2SnO) employs reagents in a more than stoichiometric amount, but when the reaction is run in a microwave apparatus a catalytic amount of Bu2SnO has been used [3]. This clearly indicates that a stoichiometric amount of reagent is not necessary. Also, a polymer supported tin reagent has been used in the selective functionalisation of carbohydrates using a catalytic [4] amount of tin containing resins. Recent works describe the use of dimethyltin dichloride (Me2SnCl2) as an effective catalyst in the monofunctionalisation described in Scheme 1 [5]. Macrolactonisation and esterification procedure with water removal are also catalysed by Bu2SnO [7]. Recently, a thorough study of the monotosylation reaction of diols with catalytic Bu2SnO has been published [8]. The possibility of performing reactions with non-stoichiometric amounts of reagents is highly desirable particularly in the case of highly toxic compounds difficult to remove from the reaction mixture like lipophilic alkyl tin reagents [6]. Bu2SnO has been used in the monofunctionalisation of carbohydrates for a long time [1]. Due to solubility requirements reactions were run in methanol were Bu2SnO is transformed into Bu2Sn(MeO)2 [1], a much more reactive specie [9]. This compound has been also employed in a stoichiometric amount for the monofunctionalisation of a series of diols [9]. 2 Results and discussion We studied the monobenzoylation of compound 1 with different tin reagents and found that a catalytic cycle can be obtained with a series of non-chlorinated tin derivatives forming the same stannylene derivative 6 as an active specie. This simple reaction allows to easily compare different reaction protocols by measuring the reaction rate and the product distribution. When compound 1 was treated at reflux in chloroform for 30min with a catalytic amount of Bu2Sn(MeO)2 (0.02eq) and the resulting solution was treated with 1.1eq of benzoyl chloride at room temperature in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) (2eq) as a base, the benzoylation reaction was complete in 10min [11] with a product distribution similar to the one observed with the same substrates with other reaction protocols [3,5]. Dibutyl tin diisopropoxide (Bu2Sn(2-PrO)2), prepared by refluxing Bu2SnO in 2-propanol for 1h and removing the solvent under high vacuum, was as effective as a catalyst for the reaction in Scheme 1. Finally, tetra butyl dimethoxide distannoxane (Bu4Me2Sn2O) obtained by reaction of Bu2SnO and dimethyl carbonate and further reaction with methanol [10] was prepared and the same reaction protocol was followed: 1 was refluxed for 20min in chloroform in the presence of 0.02eq of Bu4(MeO)2Sn2O. The mixture was then treated at room temperature with 1.1mol of benzoyl chloride and TEA. Analysis of samples showed that the reaction was complete in about 10min time. These experiments strongly suggest that a common intermediate might be responsible for the catalytic cycle. It is well known that exchange reactions occur between tin alkoxides and diols thus generating the corresponding tin cyclic ketals [1,8,9]. 2.1 Benzoylation catalysed by the stannylene ketal 6 Compound 6 obtained by refluxing 1 with 1eq of Bu2SnO in methanol was isolated, characterised and proved to be identical with the compounds obtained from 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol with a stoichiometric amount of the tin reagents 7–10 [12]. 1-Phenyl-1,2-ethanediol 1 (500mg, 3.6mmol) in chloroform (20ml) was then treated at room temperature with compound 6 (26mg, 0.07mmol, 0.02eq), benzoyl chloride (509mg, 3.6mmol) and TEA (730mg, 7.2mmol). Reaction samples analysed by TLC and 1H NMR showed that compound 1 was completely transformed in about 10min [11] giving a 10:1 mixture of 2 and 3. We believe that these results show that in all the above experiments there is an exchange reaction between the initially formed tin alkoxide and the diol to give the ketal 6, which is the active reaction catalyst. The proposed mechanism for the catalytic cycle, is reported in Scheme 2 . We have not explored the effect of the nature and amount of base on the selectivity and the rate of the reaction. A few solvents have been tested but from previous data from the literature [8] it is reasonable to believe that the choice is much larger. Table 1 reports the data of reaction in Scheme 1 with four different tin compounds used in a catalytic amount in different solvents. t (min) indicates the time at which the diol is completely transformed after benzoyl chloride addition. 2/3 indicates the ratio between the two isomeric monobenzoates as determined by 1H NMR studies. From the preparative point of view, the use of 6 as catalyst (0.02eq) in CHCl3 proved to be the most practical protocol. 3 Conclusions We have established for the first time the catalytic nature of the tin acetal 6 in the benzoylation of 1. The present method has the following peculiarities: (i) A catalytic amount of tin compound is required, not involving toxic chloro tin derivatives or microwave irradiation. (ii) The stannylene ketal can be generated from commercially available tin species in the appropriate solvent and then used as catalyst in the benzoylation reaction in a different solvent if required. (iii) A wide range of solvents from non-polar to isopropanol can be used allowing to work in homogeneous solution even with less soluble substrates [13]. (iv) The catalytic cycle is active with any of the tin species in Scheme 3 and the selective acylation goes to completion in 5–15min at room temperature (>60min without the tin catalyst). 4 Experimental Bu2SnO and the other dibutyl tin derivatives 7 and 8 were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Bu2Sn(2-PrO)2 was prepared from Bu2SnO in 2-PrOH as described above. Bu4(MeO)2Sn2O was prepared from dibutyl tin oxide and dimethyl carbonate as described in the literature [10]. 4.1 Preparation of the stannylene ketal 6 Compound 6 was prepared from each of the following stannylene derivatives: the compound prepared from Bu2SnO 5 was isolated purified and characterised. In all other cases, the compound was not purified and used as such in the benzoylation reaction. The presence of compound 6 in the mixture was assessed by inspection of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the crude material. 4.1.1 From Bu2SnO (5) Compound 1 (5.0g, 36mmol) was dissolved in 50ml of toluene. Dibutyltin oxide (8.9g, 35.7mmol) is added. The suspension was refluxed for 24h in a Dean Stark apparatus. Compound 6 was isolated after solvent removal and stored in a dry box for further use. 1H and 13C NMR were identical with the one reported in the literature. 4.1.2 From Bu2SnCl2 (8) Compound 1 (5.0g, 36mmol) was dissolved in 50ml of toluene. Dibutyltin dichloride (11g, 36mmol) was added together with triethylamine (800mg, 2eq). The solution was refluxed for 2h. The reaction mixture containing compound 6 was used as such for the acylation reaction. 4.1.3 From Bu2Sn(MeO)2 (7) Compound 1 (5.0g, 36mmol) was dissolved in 50ml of methanol. Bu2Sn(MeO)2 (10.6g, 36mmol) was added and the solution was refluxed for 2h. Compound 6 was obtained after solvent removal and used as such for the acylation reaction. 4.1.4 From Bu2Sn(2-PrO)2 (9) Compound 1 (0.5g, 3.6mmol) was dissolved in 10ml of 2-propanol. Bu2Sn(2-PrO)2 (1.25g, 3.6mmol) was added and the solution was refluxed for 2h. Compound 6 was obtained after solvent removal and used as such for the acylation reaction. 4.1.5 From Bu4(MeO)2Sn2O (10) Compound 1 (0.5g, 3.6mmol) was dissolved in 25ml of CHCl3. Bu4(MeO)2Sn2O (1.25g, 3.6mmol) was added and the solution was refluxed for 2h. Compound 6 was obtained after solvent removal and used as such for the acylation reaction. 4.1.6 (±)4-Phenyl-2,2-di-n-butyl-1,3,2-dioxa stannolan (6) 1H NMR (250MHz,CDCl3): δ =0.92 (m, 6H); 1.1–2.0 (m, 12H); 3.19 (br, dd, 1H, J =9.5 and 9.0); 3.79 (Br, dd, 1H, J =9.0 and 4.0); 4.50 (br, dd, 1H, J =9.5 and 4.0); 7.1–7.6 (m, 5H). 13C NMR (250MHz,CDCl3): δ =13.61 (q); 22.36 (t); 26.87 (t); 27.36 (t); 69.28 (t); 75.74 (d); 126.76 (d); 127.64 (d); 128.21 (d); 143.02 (s). 4.2 Benzoylation of compound 1 with benzoyl chloride in different solvents and conditions 4.2.1 With 6 as catalyst in CHCl3 Compound 1 1-phenyl-1,2-ethane diol (0.5g, 3.6mmol) was dissolved in 20ml of CHCl3. Compound 6 (0.026g, 0.07mmol, 0.02eq) in 5ml of CHCl3 was added to the solution together with TEA (1.0ml, 7.2mmol) and benzoylchloride (0.42ml, 3.6mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature until the starting material had disappeared (10min from TLC hex-ethyl ac. 1:1, rf PED 0.18, primary monoac. 0.34). The reaction was quenched with water (10ml) and the two phases separated.

(C) 1971 3972 3976 [11] In the absence of the assistance of a tin intermediate the mono benzoylation of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol 1 required in control experiments more than 60min, with a statistical product distribution [12] Compound 6 is depicted in Scheme 2 as a monomeric compound. From spectral data in the literature [2,8] it has been proposed a multimeric structure in solution. This structure should be chemically equivalent to the monomeric one [13] Experiments with substrates non-soluble in organic solvents will be reported elsewhere",

The stannylene ketal of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol has been prepared and used as a catalyst or generated in situ by exchange with other mixed tin ketals. In either case, the acylation occurs rapidly with 2mol% of the catalyst with the known selectivity. These experiments clearly establish the catalytic nature of the acylation reaction.",
