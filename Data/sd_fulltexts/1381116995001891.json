Rab Ezzouar, Algeria Received 8 April 1994; revised 7 February 1995; accepted 24 July 1995 Abstract The adsorption of methanol, (D4) methanol and formaldehyde on rhodium containing catalysts is studied by FTIR. Besides the well characterized metboxy and formate species, new bands could be observed on the Ce02 and Pr60supported catalysts. Comparison with results obtained by chemical trapping enables us to identify the new species as a stabilized formyl. The mechanism of methanol dissociation is discussed. Keywords: Carbon monoxide; Hydrogen; Methanol; Formaldehyde; FTIR; Formyl; Adsorption; Rhodium 1. Introduction Many studies have been undertaken to study the influence of the supports and promoters on the reactivity and selectivity of rhodium catalysts in CO-HZ reactions. Many models have been proposed to explain the drastic changes with the support for Rh catalysts which were first reported by Ichikawa [ 1,2].Among them electronic and/ or electrostatic interaction, built up of new catalytic sites, maintaining the metal in a higher oxidation state, stabilization of reaction intermediates have been invoked. These aspects have been discussed in details in Ref. [ 3 ] . In a recent work it has been shown by TPD and TPSR that two reaction mechanisms may be involved in methane formation on Rh/ Si02 [ 4 ] . Borer and Prins [ 5 ] have recently proposed that, on Rh/La203, formates * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$09.50 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00189-1 located on the support could be the reaction intermediate in CH30H formation. Chinchen et al., [ 6 ] concluded also that formates might be involved in methanol synthesis on rhodium containing catalysts. However, on Rh/Ti02, Takeuchi and Katzer [ 7 ] did not observe isotopic mixing on the oxygen when starting from C' g0 to produce methanol thus excluding formates as intermediates in methanol formation on their catalyst. In presence of some promoters the adsorption of carbon monoxide is also affected. The adsorption mode of carbon monoxide can have an effect on the formation of some adsorbed species. Sachder and Ichikawa [ 8 ] reported that bridge bonded CO is preferentially suppressed in presence of the promoter. Further, several authors have also observed that a new absorption band appears in the IR spectra of adsorbed carbon monoxide [ 815 ] . The band is situated at a lower frequency 238 D. Demri et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (1996) 237-249 than usually observed for CO adsorption on pure metals. This new adsorption mode of CO is related to an increased dissociation probability of the CO bond and has been ascribed to the coordination of CO through both ends of the CO molecules. A C and O coordinated species has been proposed to be a key intermediate in the CO hydrogenation reactions [ 16,17 ] . This is evident for the CO dissociation, since for dissociation carbon monoxide must at one moment tilt towards the surface as suggested by de Koster and van Santen [ 18] by theoretical calculations. Further, Anderson and Dowd [ 19] have shown that the tilting with respect to the surface normal enhances the electron back-donation into the 21r* orbital of CO and decreases the C-O bond strength. The C and O coordination can also favour the CO migratory insertion into a metal-alkyl or a metal-hydrogen bond [ 8,20-22] . This has been confirmed by theoretical calculations for iron complexes [ 23 ] . Recently, the stabilization of a surface acetyl species has been observed during the adsorption of acetaldehyde on promoted rhodium catalysts which are effective in ethanol synthesis from CO + HZ [ 24] . Schild et al., [ 25 ] have shown that an nz(C,O) CH20 species is formed during the adsorption of methanol or formaldehyde or by CO+HZ reaction on Pd/Zr02- On Pd/Ce02, Diagne et al., [26] proposed from chemical trapping and TPD experiments that formyl species are involved in methanol formation from CO-H2. Despite careful research, no formyl species were observed by IR in CO + HZ reaction on catalytic surfaces until Saussey et al., [27] reported their formation on ZnO and on ZnO supported copper catalysts. The adsorption of formaldehyde on oxides is well documented in the literature. Formates are the predominant adsorbed form on oxides such as Fe203 [ 28 ] , A1203 [ 29 ] , Mg0 [ 30 ] , Ti02 [ 3032], Si02 [33], Zr02 [33,34], Th02 [32,33]. Additionally methoxy and dioxymethylene entities have been observed at higher coverages [ 32,33 ] . Dioxymethylene together with formate were produced from adsorption of HCHO on Ce02 at 300 K. Band intensities of dioxymethy- lene and methoxy species increased markedly when cerium oxide was partially reduced prior to the adsorption [ 35 ] . The adsorption of formaldehyde has also been studied by EELS on metals. On Ni(110), the primary surface intermediate has been shown to be a methoxy species [361. At higher coverages solid formaldehyde and polymeric paraformaldehyde are detected. Anton et al., [37] have adsorbed formaldehyde on clean and oxygen precovered Ru (001) single crystals. q2 formaldehyde was observed on clean Ru (001) and the r1' (O) configuration is favoured in presence of oxygen. Upon decomposition on these surfaces, -q2(C,O) formyl species are formed. On a Pt(110)-(1x2) surface molecularly adsorbed formaldehyde, r1Z(C,O) formyl species, hydrogen adatoms and chemisorbed carbon monoxide are surface intermediates in the decomposition reaction of formaldehyde [ 38 ] . Davis and Barteau [ 39 ] propose the intermediacy of a formyl species in the decomposition of HZCO on Pd(111) . Houtman and Barteau [40] observed that CH20 is decomposed to CO and HZ at T < 130 K on clean Rh(111) and paraformaldehyde appears at high coverage. On an O-predosed surface paraformaldehyde, CO, formate and q' (O) formaldehyde are detected. Adsorption of methanol on oxides has also been widely studied. Two kinds of methoxy species were detected by Li et al., [ 35 ] when Ce02 was exposed to CH30H at 300 K. Binet et al., [41 ] have observed that three kinds of methoxy species are formed on Ce02 after CH30H adsorption. Solymosi et al., [42] have investigated the adsorption of CH30H on a clean Rh (111) surface. They evidenced the formation of CH30 species which can be hydrogenated to CH30H or decomposed to adsorbed CO and HZ at 200-220 K. In presence of oxygen, Solymosi et al., [43] observed an increase of the surface concentration of irreversibly bound methoxy species and a slight stabilization effect of this methoxy moieties. Parmeter et al., [44] studied the adsorption of methanol on Rh (100) by EELS. At 200-220 K they observed an OH bond cleavage to form an Obonded methoxy species. Between 250 and 320 K D. Demri et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (7996) 237-249 a fraction of the methoxy species decomposed to form CO and H adatoms. Preadsorbed Cu on Rh(100) stabilizes the methoxy species and shifts the methoxy decomposition product from adsorbed CO to HCHO(g) [45]. The present study has been done to show that indeed formyl species can exist on oxide supported and promoted rhodium catalysts and thus that the mechanism through CO insertion into a metal-hydrogen bond is possible on promoted catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The rare earth oxides were prepared from their nitrate (Ln(N03)3-6H20) (Ln=rare earth). 10 g Ln (NO3) 3 - 6H20 were dissolved in 400 ml distilled water, heated under stirring at 80. The pH was adjusted to 7 by ammonia. The precipitate was filtered, dried at 120 and calcined in air at 400 for 10 h. The BET specific surface area of the oxides were about 35 m2/g. The silica was obtained from Roth (0201, 100 mesh) and contains less than 100 ppm of Na, K and Fe. The catalysts were prepared by a conventional impregnation of the support (Si02, Ce02, Pr60, , ) by the suitable amount of an aqueous solution of RhCI3 -xH,O from Johnson Matthey to obtained 3 wt% Rh/support. The catalysts were dried at 120, and calcined in air at 450 for 10 h. 2.2. Catalyst reduction In the infrared experiments the catalysts were reduced in situ at 400 by hydrogen which was admitted into the cell. The hydrogen atmosphere was then pumped off and the procedure was repeated 5 times. Metal particle size and dispersion (in brackets) as measured by carbon monoxide adsorption by pulse techniques were Rh/Si0z:3.1 nm (35%); Rh/Ce02:2.5 nm (43%); Rh/Pr601.9 nm (60%). 239 These results are in good agreement with TEM measurements. 2.3. FTIR spectroscopy 10 to 20 mg of catalyst were pelleted in form of a disk of 12 mm in diameter. The spectra were taken in a vacuum device similar to that used by Lamotte [46]. The spectra were recorded on a Nicolet MXI FTIR spectrometer after 100 scans with a 4 cm-' resolution. 3 to 5 kPa of methanol, formaldehyde or formic acid were introduced into the vacuum device and a first spectrum was taken after 5 min at room temperature. The pellet was then lifted into the heating part for 10 min. The pellet was reintroduced into the beam in the part at room temperature. The pressure was maintained constant during the measurement (3 to 5 kPa) . The reported values are therefore for an important coverage. Experiments were made after pumping the gas atmosphere, but the band at 1665 cm-' disappears rapidly with time. The reported spectra are obtained after subtraction of the catalytic pellet and the gas phase spectra. Introduction of formaldehyde: trioxymethylene was introduced into a vacuum vessel, dried under vacuum and depolymerized by heating. The formaldehyde vapors were introduced into the IR cell. 2.4. Chemical trapping experiments The device used for the chemical trapping has been reported elsewhere [ 47 ] . Methanol or formaldehyde was adsorbed on the catalyst and than heated to 120, temperature at which appears the band at 1665 cm-' in the infra red spectra on the promoted samples. ICH3 or ICD3 is added in large excess. The formed products are analyzed by GC with a FID detector [ 47 ] . 3.

The adsorption at room temperature and 120 give rise to bands at 2921 cm-', 2850 cm-', 2800 cm-', 1430 cm-' and 1065 cm-'. These bands correspond well to those observed in the present work for methanol adsorption on Pr60and have been attributed to methoxy species ( III ) ( 2926 vaCH3, 2846 (Fermi resonance between 28CH3 and vH3),2790cm-` vSCH3,1431 cm-' 8CH3 and 1065 cm-' vC-O). Bands at 2865 cm-', 1605, 1567, 1375 cm-' and 740 cm-' can be observed and increase upon heating to 120. For methanol adsorption only traces of these bands are observed. Comparing these bands to those observed by Li et al., [ 35 ] during adsorption of formic acid on Ce02 these bands can be ascribed to monodentate and bidentate formate species. Further, features are obtained at 2940, 1430, 1159, 967 and 864 cm-' and decrease upon heating at 120. These bands are in good agreement with bands observed during adsorption of formaldehyde on Ru ( 001) by Anton et al., [ 37 ] . These authors assigned these frequencies to vaCH2, SCH2, wCHz, vC-O and pCH2 of an adsorbed CH20 in the 772(C,O)CHZO (V) configuration. As can be seen in Fig. 8a, the same bands can be formed for formaldehyde adsorbed on Rh/Pr60, , . Additional bands at 1492, 1407, 1112 and 925 cm-' are very similar to that reported by Busca et al., [ 33 ] for the adsorption of formaldehyde on Th02. These authors attributed these features to a 246 D. Demri et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical l(1996) 237-249 P N 1(1 N N a~ co V O .n .O V .O O.

FTIR spectra after CH=O adsorption and heating to 120 on Pr60 surface dioxymethylene species (VIII). However upon heating to 60-120 new bands develop simultaneously at 2762, 2645, 2556 and 1665 cm-' as can be seen clearly from the difference spectra between 120 and 60 (Fig. 8b) . 3.5. Discussion of the bands at 1665 em-' According to the literature bands at 1665 cm-' could be attributed to an q'(O)CH20 species ( VI ) [ 37 ] . However these species are only present at very low temperatures about 80 K. 77 2 ( C,O ) CH20 ( V ) is present on the catalysts as shown in the part on formaldehyde adsorption. Further, monodentate formates ( I) have also been observed in that area on Cu/Si02 [51] and Cu (100) [50]. However, as indicated before, the bands at 2770 ( 2762 ) , 2660 ( 2645 ) 2596 ( 2556 ) cm-' are developed simultaneously to the band at 1665 cm-' upon heating and obviously all these features correspond to the same species. Further, monodentate formate give rise to a vO-C-O band at around 1600 cm-' as shown in Ref. [ 35 ] . Chemical trapping experiments by CD31 have shown that CD3CH0 is formed in the conditions where these bands appear [ 14,47 ] ( 400 K). The formation of CD3CH0 would be in accordance with the reaction of a formyl species (VII) with a CD3 species formed during the decomposition of CD3I, in agreement with the following scheme: CD3 + CHO -j CD3CH0 In acetaldehyde adsorption on the same catalyst, in the same conditions, an acetyl species has been evidenced [ 24] . As compared to the band at - 1600 cm-' found by Saussey et al., [27] on Zn0 and Cu/ZnO, the band at 1665 cm-' seems at a high frequency. However, most of the formyl species found in the literature are stabilized by the interaction of the D. Demri et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (1996) 237-249 0 2033.3 1766.7 1500.0 247 1 33.3 9 6.67 0.00 3100.0 2833.3 2566.7 2300.0 WAVENUMBER (CM-1) Fig. 8. FTIR spectra: (a) after CH20 adsorption and heating to I20 on Rh/Pr~O (b) difference spectra between 120.' and 60 after CH20 on Rh/Pr.O oxygen end of the species with a cation. This interaction results in a decrease of the frequency of the vC=O vibration of the formyl species. Further neutral formyl entities with higher vC=O frequencies (1630-1640 cm-' and even at 1660 cm-') have been prepared [ 52-54] . Van der Lee et al., [ 55 ] and van der Lee and Ponec [ 56 ] have shown that the formation of methanol is related to the amount of positively charged rhodium as extracted by acetylacetone for rhodium catalysts. Formyl species can be stabilized by a positive charge on the metal [ 57-59 ] . A positive charge on the metal would give less back-donation, the carbene nature proposed by Gladysz [60] would diminish and the vC=O frequency would appear at a higher frequency. This would also explain the stability of this species to higher temperature 400 K as compared to 280 K as observed by Saussey et al., [ 27 ] . An 71' ( C ) formyl species ( VII) is therefore proposed to give rise to the band at 1665 cm-'. 4. Conclusion From our results the following scheme can be written for methanol decomposition to CO on the rhodium containing catalysts. 248 D. Demri et al. /Journal qj'Molecular Catalvsis A: Chemical l(1996) 237-249 H (CH30H)ads --> 3 ~ CH2-O ~ C = 0 ~ CO ads. The presence of an r12(CHO) species as proposed by Anton et al., [ 35 ] for formaldehyde adsorption on Ru cannot be excluded. However it could not be observed in our conditions. The observed formyl species are not very stable and appear only as a transient entity during heating up of methanol or formaldehyde. It is decomposed at temperature higher than 120. It can also only be observed on the promoted catalysts. In previous studies [ 8-15 ] , it has been shown that the promoters can affect the carbon monoxide adsorption. A C and O coordinated species is present on the promoted catalysts. It is known that such an adsorption mode might favour the CO insertion [ 8,20-22 ] . In the present work it is also evidenced that a formyl species is stabilized in presence of the promoters. It is therefore proposed that the role of the promoter is to suppress the sites for methane formation [4], to create new sites for CO adsorption [ 8-15 ] and to stabilize the acyl (formyl and acetyl) species. No oxygenated species other than methoxy entities are observed on the unpromoted Rh1Si02 catalyst, which produces only hydrocarbons in the CO + HZ reaction. References [ l ] M. Ichikawa, Bull. Chem.

The adsorption of methanol, (D4) methanol and formaldehyde on rhodium containing catalysts is studied by FTIR. Besides the well characterized methoxy and formate species, new bands could be observed on the CeO2 and Pr6O11 supported catalysts. Comparison with results obtained by chemical trapping enables us to identify the new species as a stabilized formyl. The mechanism of methanol dissociation is discussed.
