Lyngby, Denmark. ⁎ Corresponding author. Epimerization of abundant monosaccharides derived from lignocellulosic biomass offers an attractive approach for the synthesis of rare sugars. Molybdenum-based catalysts demonstrate excellent glucose-mannose epimerization performance, but most studies have neglected the synthesis of other sugar epimers and the pathways of their formation. Here, reduced Beta zeolite supported MoOx catalysts (Mo/Beta) with 1.5–10 wt% Mo loading were examined for glucose epimerization in water, specifically focusing on the formation of the rare sugars allose and altrose. The physicochemical structure and the catalytic activity of the catalyst were examined in detail, and the reaction mechanisms for the epimer formation were probed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that 5 wt% Mo/Beta achieved a near-equilibrium mannose yield of 30 % from glucose within 10 min at reaction temperatures below 140 °C, exhibiting a relatively low activation energy (∼67 kJ mol−1). At elevated reaction temperatures (≥ 120 °C), the rare sugars allose and altrose accumulated to combined yields of 24 % at 140 °C. An isotope labelling study using NMR spectroscopy corroborated the catalysis to involve 1,2-carbon shifts that elicit the formation of rare sugars at sufficiently high temperatures. Evaluation of catalyst reuse and regeneration indicated that supported MoOx had higher stability than MoO3, but the stability of the Mo/Beta catalysts under hydrothermal conditions leaves room for improvement.

These sugars can relatively easily be isolated from biomass and utilized as food ingredients or derivatized into other products[1]. By contrast, a large group of unique monosaccharides referred to as rare sugars (e.g. allose and altrose) with valuable bioactivity in natural products and pharmaceuticals, cannot be easily extracted from natural sources[2,3]. For example, D-allose demonstrates synergistic effects when used in conjunction with various radio- and chemotherapies for cancer treatment[4]. Efficient strategies for the synthesis of rare sugar isomers include the chemical isomerization and epimerization of abundant biomass-derived aldoses and ketoses[5]. Despite the significant progress made with the introduction of Mo-based catalysts for sugar epimerization, optimized catalyst systems and detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanisms towards rare sugars are sparse. As a significant milestone in carbohydrate chemistry, Bílik and co-workers discovered already in 1972 that dissolved molybdates/molybdic acid can efficiently catalyze sugar epimerization under aqueous acidic conditions (pH 2.5–3.5)[6,7]. Subsequently, the immobilization of Mo-containing compounds onto appropriate supports to obtain solid catalyst systems has been effectively explored using supports like layered double hydroxide, commercial resins, functionalized porous silica and SBA-15[8–10]. Likewise, hydrothermally stable Mo-based compounds such as polyoxometalates (POMs)[11,12], heteropolyacids[13], polymetallic catalysts (e.g. CuAlMoO4 and CuAgAlMoO4)[14], MoS2 2D nanosheets[15] and Mo compounds (e.g. MoP, α-MoSi2 and α-MoB)[16], as well as POMs modified with niobium[17], ionic liquids[18,19] and metal-organic framework material[20] have been considered as catalyst systems with improved immobilization and performance. On the other hand, Zhang et al. employed an electrical immobilization technique to enhance the stability of a MoOx nanoparticle (NP) epimerization catalyst under hydrothermal flow conditions, which allowed to reduce the total Mo leaching to only 3.2 % after 16 days of glucose epimerization with a constant potential of 24 V[21]. By comparison, activated carbon–supported molybdenum oxide catalysts (Mo/AC) showed a relatively large 53.8 % Mo loss after a single use for glucose epimerization in batch[22]. Notably, the latter catalyst exhibited however the lowest apparent activation energy and the highest production rate of mannose, possibly due to the beneficial role of oxygen defects[21,23]. While Mo-based catalysts have been widely investigated for the epimerization of glucose to mannose, only few studies have focused on the synthesis of rare sugars like allose and altrose from glucose[24,25], even though the latter sugars are occasionally noticed as by-products[26,27]. Furthermore, the mechanistic pathway underlying the synthesis of allose and altrose via the epimerization of glucose is not well-understood[7,28]. Based on the promising catalytic activity of MoOx for epimerization, we have in the present work explored the use of reduced Beta zeolite-supported MoOx (Mo/Beta) catalysts for the epimerization of glucose in aqueous media. The catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation of ammonium molybdate onto NH4-Beta zeolite, followed by subsequent calcination and reduction. Remarkably, the allose and altrose rare sugars were by unambiguous 2D NMR identification and quantification found to accumulate very quickly in reactions performed at high reaction temperatures. Probing by NMR spectroscopy further allowed to propose a reaction mechanism for the formation of the rare sugars. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Mo/Beta zeolite catalysts with different Mo loading were prepared by a general three-step procedure involving impregnation, calcination and reduction. Initially, 1.0 g of commercially available zeolite NH4-Beta (SiO2/Al2O3 = 38, CP814C, Zeolyst International), an appropriate amount of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4 H2O, ≥ 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich), and MiliQ water (2.0 mL) were mixed in a 10 mL oven-dried round bottom flask. Water was then removed using a rotary evaporator (125 mbar, 50 °C, 100 rpm), and the solid material was oven dried (110 °C, 48 h). Then, the powder was sieved to <125 μm particles and calcined (550 °C, 6 h) upon heating to the set temperature (heating ramp 10 °C min−1). Finally, the catalyst sample was reduced at 805 °C for 2 h in a H2 gas flow (99.999 %, Air Liquid Denmark, 30 mL min−1) after heating to the set temperature (heating ramp 10 °C min−1). The Mo content of the samples was calculated based on the amount of added (NH4)6Mo7O24·4 H2O. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Huber G670 Guinier diffractometer utilizing Cu-Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from a focused quartz monochromatic beam. The exposure time was set to 10 min with a step size of 0.005° within a 2θ interval ranging from 3 to 100°. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of catalysts was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 instrument equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. The spectra were recorded in a measuring range of 4000–500 cm− 1 with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 using 256 scans. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on catalysts using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical analyzer and an Al Kα micro-focused monochromator. Data analysis was conducted using the Avantage v5.9925 software. Nitrogen physisorption was performed to measure porosity and BET surface area of the samples using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 analyzer. Prior to determining the adsorption-desorption isotherms at −196 °C, the samples were degassed in a vacuum at 200 °C for 4 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were captured with an FEI Quanta FEG 250 ESEM microscope, operating at 15 kV and a working distance of 10.0 mm. Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were collected using an Oxford X Max EDS detector. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were obtained using a JEM-2010 (JEOL Ltd., Japan) transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV. Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by depositing the powder onto a copper TEM grid with an amorphous carbon support film. 2.3 Catalyst testing In a typical epimerization reaction, the Mo/Beta catalysts (50 mg) and an aqueous glucose solution (5 mL, 0.5 mol L−1) were added into an Ace® pressure tube (15 mL) containing a magnetic stirring bar. The reaction was conducted in a preheated oil bath at a set temperature for a desired duration under stirring (750 rpm), whereafter the reactor was quickly quenched in cold water. The reaction mixture was subsequently filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an Agilent HPLC 1200 series apparatus equipped with a refractive index detector (RID) and a Rezex-RCM-Monosaccharide Ca2+ 300×7.8 mm column (mobile phase: MilliQ water; flow rate: 0.6 mL min−1; temperature: 80 °C). Isotope labelling studies were further performed using [1-13C]-glucose as substrates with analysis performed directly on the crude (filtered) reaction mixtures by NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker AVANCE III 800 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a TCI z-gradient CryoProbe and a Sample Jet sample changer. Each sample for NMR consisted of crude reaction mixture (500 μL) mixed with methanol-d4 (100 μL), which served as the lock substance. The yields of the reaction products were quantified through 13C and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR analysis, as previously described[29]. 2.4 Catalyst reuse and regeneration Following the general reaction protocol described above, the Mo/Beta zeolites were collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 3 min), washed with water (2 × 40 mL) and oven-dried (110 °C, 2 h) prior to reuse. The dry, used catalysts were regenerated via reduction at 550 °C for 1 h in a H2 gas flow (99.999 %, Air Liquid Denmark, 30 mL min−1) after heating to the set temperature (heating ramp 10 °C min−1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The morphology of the prepared Mo/Beta catalysts with Mo loadings between 1.5–10 wt% was depicted by electron microscopy ( Fig. 1a-n). All the catalysts contained regularly shaped particles with sizes of 0.5–1 μm (Fig. 1a and g-i) and highly dispersed Mo species at the support (Fig. 1b-f and Fig. S1). The initial calcination likely dispersed MoO3 onto the zeolites, whereas the subsequent reduction led to lower valent Mo species such as Mo4O11, MoO2 or even Mo metal[30]. The high-temperature reduction could further induce the aggregation of Mo species, leading to the formation of MoOx particles by a eutectic system between MoO3 and Mo4O11 or by sintering of Mo metal (Fig. 1k-n)[31]. For the low-loaded catalysts, the Mo species is expected to be more readily reduced into Mo metal resulting in sintering of the Mo within the structure of the Beta zeolite (Fig. 1k)[32]. By contrast, reduction of the catalysts with appropriate Mo loadings appeared to give more well-dispersed MoOx species (Fig. 1l-m). With increasing Mo loadings, the Mo species appeared to permeate the microporous structure and crystal lattice of Beta zeolite more extensively, resulting in the formation of MoOx particles on the surfaces, corresponding to the blocky darker regions observed in the TEM image (Fig. 1j). The pore size distributions and porosity of the H-Beta and of the Mo/Beta catalysts with varying Mo loadings are shown in Fig. 1o and Table 1, respectively. At Mo loadings up to 5 wt%, only small changes in the porosity were observed, confirming that Mo was well dispersed in the Beta zeolite channels and surfaces[33]. By contrast, at higher loadings the micropores and interparticle zeolite voids smaller than 30 Å were progressively blocked presumably by accumulation of excess Mo species, resulting in decreasing microporous volume from 0.208 cm3 g−1 (H-Beta) to 0.068 cm3 g−1 (10 wt% Mo/Beta) as well as reduced total pore volume and surface area. Likewise, the higher Mo loading led to the formation of new interparticle mesopores ranging from 30 to 200 Å, as clearly shown for the 10 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst. The powder XRD patterns for both H-Beta and the prepared Mo/Beta catalysts are further shown in Fig. 2a. All the Mo/Beta catalysts displayed two prominent diffraction peaks at 2θ of 7.7° (101) and 22.5° (302) confirming that the framework topology of zeolite Beta was maintained[34]. However, the intensities of the peaks decreased significantly with increasing Mo loadings (particularly with 10 wt% Mo loading), most likely because Mo species interacted with framework Al of the zeolite leading to the formation of molybdates, potentially causing irreversible damage to the zeolite structure[35]. Consistent with this interpretation, the (302) lattice peak showed a slight shift to a lower angle with increasing Mo loading indicating that the Mo species was incorporated into the zeolite framework under high temperatures (805 °C) through solid-state ion exchange, consequently expanding the unit cell of the zeolite[36]. This was also observed by TEM, where the lattice spacing of the (302) (Beta zeolite, PDF JCPDS No. 48–0074) expanded from 0.798 nm to 0.813 nm (Fig. 1j). Moreover, no peaks corresponding to crystalline MoO3 were observed in any of the catalysts, while the 10 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst displayed diffraction peaks characteristic of Mo metal, e.g. 2θ of 40.5° corresponding to Mo (110)[33]. This observation suggests that Mo in the low-loaded catalysts was highly dispersed - likely forming a MoOx monolayer - with no characteristic diffraction peaks[33], while Mo accumulated into crystals with a size measurable by XRD in the high-loaded catalyst. FTIR spectra of the catalysts also revealed that isolated Si-OH defects (ν = 3743 cm−1) and the Si-O-Si and Si-O-Al primary structural units (ν = 1235 cm−1) of the Beta zeolite decreased (or disappeared) with higher Mo loading (Fig. 2b). This observation further corroborated that Mo species were incorporated into the zeolite framework, leading to the disruption of the structure. The oxidation states of the Mo species in the Mo/Beta catalysts were examined by Mo 3d XPS (Fig. 2c-f), which displayed distinctive signals at 236.5, 233.5, 230.8 and 228.7 eV assigned to Mo6+, Mo5+, Mo4+, low-valence and metallic Mo (JCPDS No. 42–1120), respectively[37]. For the catalysts with low Mo loadings (1.5 and 5.0 wt%), having a high dispersion of MoOx on the zeolite (see above), the Mo species were readily reduced into lower oxidation states, including metallic Mo (Figs. 2c and 2d). By contrast, the accumulated MoOx species in the catalysts with higher Mo loadings (7.5 and 10 wt%) were only partially reduced with mainly Mo4+ (MoO2) and Mo6+ (MoO3) oxide species coexisting in the catalysts (Figs. 2e and 2f), and no obvious signal resulting from Mo metal was observed with 10 wt% Mo/Beta, although a characteristic diffraction peak was observed by XRD for the catalyst (see above). Thus, the observation overall is consistent with the reduction of loaded MoO3 to MoO2, and to MoOx and Mo[37]. 3.2 Catalytic tests and kinetic analysis The epimerization of glucose was initially examined at 120 ℃ for 10 min with the Mo/Beta catalysts having different Mo loadings and the obtained results are summarized in Table 2. A maximum yield of mannose of 26.1 % (96.2 % selectivity) was obtained with the 5 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst (Table 2, entry 3), while lower yields were obtained with the catalysts having both lower and higher Mo loadings. Especially the 10 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst had a low activity resulting in drastically reduced glucose conversion and mannose yield to 4 % (Table 2, entry 5), which most likely was a consequence of the blockage of the micropores in the catalyst and the resulting low density of accessible active sites (see Fig. 2c and Table 1). Importantly, the H-Beta gave no obvious glucose conversion (Table 2, entry 1), thus confirming that the Mo inventory of the catalysts was responsible for the catalytically activity in the epimerization. The influence of reaction time and reaction temperature on the glucose epimerization was also examined with the 5 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst, and the observed concentrations of glucose and mannose are depicted in Fig. 3a. The reaction temperature had a significant impact on the reaction which reached a near-equilibrium distribution between glucose and mannose at 140 ℃ within 10 min, while a reaction time of 2 h was required at a lower temperature of 80 ℃ to reach a near-equilibrium distribution. Notably, side reactions leading to the formation of other products were apparent above 120 ℃ as subsequently validated by 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy[38,39]. The data for the observed glucose/mannose concentrations were fitted very well to a first order time course at the lower reaction temperatures (< 120 °C) using an exponential function C i + C 0 e t i / t 0 (R2 > 0.99), while the fitting at higher reaction temperatures (120 ℃: R2 > 0.97, 140 ℃: R2 > 0.93) did not align as well with a first-order (exponential) reaction progress due to the side reactions of glucose. From the fitted curves the reaction rates for glucose conversion (rateglu) and mannose formation (rateman) could be estimated at different temperatures (Figs. S2a and S2c), allowing deriving linear relationships between reaction rate constants and the observed concentrations (Figs. S2b and S2d). Interestingly, the rates of glucose conversion at 120 and 140 ℃ underwent a change after 30 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. S2b). Specifically, the rate constant of glucose consumption at 140 ℃ was changed from 0.528 to 0.0245 min−1, thus strongly suggesting that a side reaction occurred after equilibration of glucose and mannose. The apparent activation energy (E a) was derived for the epimerization from an Arrhenius plot (ln k versus 1/T) using the rate constants (k) (Fig. 3b), and as expected the values for activation energies determined from the glucose conversion (64.0 ± 3.7 kJ mol−1) were consistent with values determined from mannose formation (69.2 ± 5.2 kJ mol−1). These E a values were relatively low compared to most values previously reported for other Mo-based catalysts[21], such as 13.3PMo/NH2-SBA-15 (80.1 kJ mol−1), Ag3PMo12O40 (96.0 kJ mol−1) and molybdates (126.1 kJ mol−1), but comparable to that found for highly active MoOx NPs (57.0 kJ mol−1) thus confirming that the Mo/Beta catalysts were indeed catalytically very active. 3.3 Product distribution and mechanistic study The rate constants for glucose consumption changed significantly after equilibrating glucose and mannose at 140 °C (Fig. S2b) due to by-product formation at elevated temperatures (≥ 120 °C). The distribution of these products was identified by 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. At lower reaction temperatures (≤ 100 °C) a high mannose product selectivity (> 90 %) was observed (Fig. 4, top), whereas glucose was converted to allose and altrose at higher reaction temperatures (≥ 140 °C) while also glycolaldehyde was formed, showing that the glucose C1 position was distributed into 50 % glucose, 23 % mannose, 12 % allose, 12 % altrose and 3 % glycolaldehyde (Fig. 4, bottom and Fig. S3). The formation of allose and altrose from glucose was in pioneering work by Bílik et al. observed with ammonium molybdate and acetic acid in water at elevated temperatures[24], but the formation pathway was not experimentally corroborated. The rare sugars have also occasionally been found as minor by-products when only reacting aqueous glucose at high temperatures or for prolonged reaction times[24,26,27]. MoOx species with two adjacent Mo atoms (Mo-O-Mo sites) as catalytic sites have been reported to lower the reaction barrier for glucose conversion[40,41]. Advancing on this, isotope labelling studies with [1-13C]-glucose were therefore used to substantiate a reaction mechanism for the formation of the reaction products observed with the 5 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst at elevated temperatures (Fig. S3). In the proposed mechanism ( Scheme 1), the initial step entails the formation of a glucose-MoOx complex[21,42]. At low temperature, the intermediate can revert to form glucose or mannose by a C1-C2 carbon shift, which is expected to result in a glucose:mannose ratio of ∼3:1[6] due to the higher thermodynamic stability of glucose relative to mannose. At higher temperatures, the C2-C3 bond can be broken, liberating glycolaldehyde, which also allows the configuration at C3 to be inverted[2], as previously proposed[28,43,44]. Breakage of this bond and isomerization of glycolaldehyde are expected to result in the four hexose products that are observed herein with 13C labelling either at the C1 or C2 positions (Scheme 1, Fig. S3). Overall, the glucose conversion reaction with Mo/Beta at elevated temperature is temperature-dependent and exhibits a complex product distribution for sufficiently high temperatures to allow C2-C3 breakage without concurrent bond formation to form mannose. Therefore, obtaining higher product selectivity requires optimization of both the reaction temperature and the media to tailor the composition of the product mixture. 3.4 Catalyst reuse and regeneration The reusability of both unreduced and reduced (805 °C, 2 h, H2 gas flow) 5 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst was finally examined in consecutive glucose epimerization reactions ( Table 3). The supported Mo species present in the unreduced (pre-calcined) catalyst are expected to be predominantly MoO3. These species proved unstable and leached under the hydrothermal reaction conditions, resulting in significantly decreased glucose conversion when reused (36.2 % vs. 1.1 % conversion; Table 3, entries 1 and 2). Similar results have been reported for aqueous glucose epimerization using a Mo/AC catalyst, where 53.8 % of the Mo was leached after recycling[22]. In the reduced catalyst, the high-temperature reduction can foster strong interaction between the Mo atoms and the aluminate in the zeolite which reduces the valence state of the supported MoOx species[45]. Accordingly, the reduced catalyst demonstrated better stability and reusability in consecutive runs (35.8–8.4 % conversion over three consecutive runs; Table 3, entries 3–5), though some Mo leaching occurred also here as indicated by a blue hue in the reaction solution, potentially indicative of molybdenum blue[46]. Regeneration of the catalyst by a post-reaction reduction (550 ℃, 1 h, H2 gas flow) restored its catalytic activity to a level comparable to those observed in the initially used catalyst (Table 3, entry 6). Unfortunately, subsequent regeneration and reuse tests showed that concurrent deactivation of the Mo/Beta catalyst seemed unavoidable (Table 3, entries 7 and 8). 4 Conclusions Supported Mo/Beta zeolite catalysts with various Mo loadings were prepared via a three-step process (wet impregnation, calcination and reduction), and demonstrated to provide catalytically active sites for the conversion of glucose into various carbohydrates in aqueous media, including the rare sugars allose and altrose. The Beta zeolite maintained its framework structure with Mo loadings up to 5 wt% having Mo species well-dispersed in the porous structure, whereas the species aggregated at higher loadings partly blocking the micropores. Furthermore, during catalyst preparation the reduction of MoO3 to MoOx species occurred, resulting primarily in Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+ oxide species. Catalytic testing in aqueous glucose epimerization showed that 5.0 wt% Mo/Beta catalyst achieved a near-equilibrium mannose yield of 30 % within only 10 min at 140 °C, with a relatively low activation energy between 64 and 69 kJ mol−1. At elevated reaction temperatures (≥ 120 °C), the rare sugars allose and altrose were formed rapidly yielding 12 % each at 140 °C, but the catalyst was also found to significantly leach Mo under these conditions. A reaction mechanism based on an NMR study with isotope labelled glucose is proposed to include MoOx-catalyzed 1,2-carbon shift of glucose, alongside thermodynamics, to account for the temperature dependence of the complex distribution of reaction products. In addition, the poor catalyst stability under hydrothermal conditions underlines the necessity and challenge of advancing the development of stable, heterogeneous Mo-based catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Epimerization of abundant monosaccharides derived from lignocellulosic biomass offers an attractive approach for the synthesis of rare sugars. Molybdenum-based catalysts demonstrate excellent glucose-mannose epimerization performance, but most studies have neglected the synthesis of other sugar epimers and the pathways of their formation. Here, reduced Beta zeolite supported MoOx catalysts (Mo/Beta) with 1.5–10 wt% Mo loading were examined for glucose epimerization in water, specifically focusing on the formation of the rare sugars allose and altrose. The physicochemical structure and the catalytic activity of the catalyst were examined in detail, and the reaction mechanisms for the epimer formation were probed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that 5 wt% Mo/Beta achieved a near-equilibrium mannose yield of 30 % from glucose within 10 min at reaction temperatures below 140 °C, exhibiting a relatively low activation energy (∼67 kJ mol−1). At elevated reaction temperatures (≥ 120 °C), the rare sugars allose and altrose accumulated to combined yields of 24 % at 140 °C. An isotope labelling study using NMR spectroscopy corroborated the catalysis to involve 1,2-carbon shifts that elicit the formation of rare sugars at sufficiently high temperatures. Evaluation of catalyst reuse and regeneration indicated that supported MoOx had higher stability than MoO3, but the stability of the Mo/Beta catalysts under hydrothermal conditions leaves room for improvement.",
