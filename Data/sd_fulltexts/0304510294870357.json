Box 165, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, China Received 27 April 1994; accepted 7 July 1994 Abstract As a part of converting coal to liquid fuels, the poisoning of commercial Fe-Cu-K catalyst in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis by carbonyl sulfide in synthesis gas was tested. Reduced coprecipitated Fe-Cu-K catalyst was investigated with synthesis gas containing 73.2, 184, 232.4, and 350.8 mg of sulfur as COS per cubic meter at 524 K under 2.31 MPa, with an hourly space velocity of 1854. The catalyst activity decreased rapidly in the first few hours of poisoning process, and finally decreased linearly with amount of sulfur fed to the catalyst until the relative activity was 0.01 to 0.05. The deactivation rates were different with the content of sulfur in synthesis gas. The selectivity to methane and gaseous C2-C4 hydrocarbons increased when the catalyst was poisoned by COS. The weight content of C5 in product decreased significantly with increasing sulfur fed to catalyst. The water-gas shift reaction in FT synthesis was also discussed in this work.

Introduction It is well known that trace amount of sulfur may decrease the catalyst activity in the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, so that the sulfur compounds must be removed before the synthesis gas is introduced into the reactor. The commercial coprecipitated Fe-Cu-K catalyst is very active for FT synthesis in our industrial plant with capacity of producing 2000 tons oil per year [ 1 ] . In order to increase the catalyst lifetime, it is important to study the effect of sulfur on the FT synthesis. Poisoning experiments are difficult to perform, because the sulfur compounds are easily absorbed by reaction system of materials, so the special gas cylinders are * Corresponding author. SSDI0304-5102(94)00137-5 256 Z.-T. Liu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 255-261 required for storing mixtures of synthesis gas. The reaction system for sulfur poisoning tests should have stainless-steel in contact with the gas stream throughout. Anderson and his coworkers [ 2-10] studied the effect of sulfur compounds on the fused catalyst in the FT synthesis and found that the poisoning degree of the fused iron catalyst decreased in the following order: SO2, HZS, CASH, COS. Hydrogen sulfide in synthesis gas is easier to be removed than carbonyl sulfide (COS) in FT synthesis in our pilot base, so we selectively studied the effect of COS on the FT synthesis over commercial Fe-Cu-K catalyst. The present paper reports the poisoning of fixed bed reactor over commercial iron catalyst by COS present in synthesis gas. After the activity of reduced catalyst became steady in pure synthesis gas, reduced coprecipitated Fe-Cu-K catalyst was tested with synthesis gas containing 73.4, 180, 232.4, and 350.8 mg of sulfur per cubic meter of synthesis gas (STP) as COS. The effect of sulfur concentration in synthesis gas and reaction temperature on the FT synthesis were investigated in this work. 2. Experimental Catalysts used here were 80-100 mesh coprecipitatedFe203-CuO-K20 catalyst. The catalyst was reduced in 2.1 H2+ 1C0 with an hourly space velocity of 1500 and at 523 K for 32 hours. The degree of Fe-reduction of oxide catalyst was about 0.911 obtained from M6ssbauer spectroscopy (MES) studies. The Fe304 particle size was 15 nm of reduced catalyst. After 30 h of synthesis in 2.1H2+I C0 gas under 2.31 MPa at a certain reaction temperature, the syngas in 2.1 Hz + 1C0 containing 73.4, 180, 232.4, or 350.8 mg. of sulfur per cubic meter as COS was introduced by a separate feed system without depressurizing the reactor. All tests were carried out at 2.31 MPa in a stainless-steel reactors, the inside diameter of the reactor was 1.20 cm. The catalyst charge was 9-10 ml, the catalyst mass density is about 1.2 g/ml, and the BET surface area is 155 M2/g, its pore volume is 0.35 cm3/g, and the average pore diameter is 80 A. Tests were started on a sulfur-free 2.1 HZ + 1 CO syngas (total sulfur content less than 2 mg per cubic meter) at an hourly space velocity of 1845 and at 504, 524, 556 K, respectively, before COS poisoning. The COS contents in syngas and in exit gas were analyzed by model GC-7A gas chromatography, using a column filled with GDX. The model 2305 gas chromatography equipped with a column of 5A zeolite molecular sieve was used to analyze HZ, CO, CH4, N2. The oxygen content of syngas is smaller than 3 ppm. The C,-C6 hydrocarbons formed in product were analyzed by model 102 gas chromatography filled with octadecane. The content of COZ was analyzed by Orsat apparatus. Data from poisoning tests are given in terms of relative activity, defined as the activity of the poisoned catalyst divided by the activity of the unpoisoned catalyst at the start of poisoning.

Effect of temperature on the activity of poisoned catalyst The effects of reaction temperature on the poisoned catalyst in the FT synthesis are shown in Fig. 2. The activity of Fe-Cu-K catalyst decreased to half when 3.95, 4.84 and 8.85 mg of sulfur per gram of catalyst had been introduced to the catalyst for the reaction temperatures of 524, 504 and 556 K respectively, which suggests that the poisoning of catalyst is more effective at low reaction temperature than that of high temperature, namely increasing the reaction temperature can increase the catalyst resistance to sulfur. On the other hand, carbon deposition was more rapidly at the high temperature, and catalyst bed usually clogged, so the temperature cannot be increased without limit in industrial factory. The effects of reaction temperature on COZ/H2O ratio formed in product are presented in Fig. 3. The water-gas shift reaction is expressed as 260 Z.-T. Liu et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 94 (1994) 255-261 Hz O + CO --*COZ + HZ 4H500 K = - 39.8 kJ/mol The C02/H2O ratio increased with increase of reaction temperature as expected in Fig. 3. All data of C02/H2O ratio decreased in the first few hours of poisoning by COS at 504, 524 and 556 K, then increased to approach the C02/H2O ratio of unpoisoned catalyst. This trend indicates that the water-gas shift reaction is more serious at the beginning of poisoning process. 3.3. Effect of temperature on the product distribution of poisoned catalyst The product distribution of poisoned catalyst at 504 and 556 K is given in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The HZ/CO usage ratio of poisoned catalyst increased significantly at 504 K. However, the usage ratio of HZ/CO changed a little at 556 K. The selectivity to hydrocarbons increased when the catalyst was poisoned by COS at 504 and 556 K. The selectivity to methane increased greatly with increase of sulfur fed to catalyst. The weight content of gaseous CZ-C4 hydrocarbons also increased over poisoned catalyst, but the olefin weight content in CZ-C4 changed little during poisoning process. The yields of C; and C5 gram per cubic meter of syngas decreased with sulfur had been introduced to catalyst. The reaction temperature also affected the olefin to paraffin ratios in gaseous hydrocarbons. 4. Conclusion The deactivation rates of iron catalyst in FT synthesis are different with the variety of COS concentration containing in syngas, namely the relative activity of poisoned catalyst decreased along different curves with the sulfur fed to catalyst. The selectivity to CH4 and C2-C4 hydrocarbons formed in product increased with the increase of sulfur fed to catalyst. However, the CS molecular fraction in product decreased significantly when the catalyst poisoned by COS, which suggests that the product distribution shifts to lighter hydrocarbon. The catalyst resistance to sulfur increased with the increase of reaction temperature. References [ 1 ] B.J.
