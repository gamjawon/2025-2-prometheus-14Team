Kelkar and Raghunath V. Chaudhari** Chemical Engineering Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune 411008 (India) (Received May 28, 1990; accepted September 20, 1990) Acetic anhydride is an important chemical produced on industrial scale. It is mainly used for the acetylation of cellulose, production of explosives such as hexogen and for the synthesis of a variety of specialty chemicals such as dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals. Carbonylation of methyl acetate provides an alternative method for the preparation of acetic anhydride. Although reported in the 1950s, this reaction was studied in greater detail by Halcon [1] and Hoechst AG [2, 3], only after the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. Recently, the process has been commercialized by Tennessee Eastman Division of Eastman Kodak [4]. A variety of catalysts involving Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd and Os with iodine promoter, an organic N- or P-containing base as a ligand have been reported in the literature [5 7]. Of all the catalysts, Rh-catalyzed Carbonylation has been studied in most detail [8,9]. The catalysts containing Ru are generally considered to have poor activity towards car- bonylation of methyl acetate [5]. Lutgendorf et al. [10] have observed that methyl acetate undergoes homologation easily compared to the Carbonylation using RuCIs SHgO as catalyst at 493 K and 220 atm pressure. We wish to report here for the first time Carbonylation of methyl acetate using ruthenium complex catalysts [such as (raws-RuCC^gClaCPPt^a, RuC^CPPI^ and H2Ru(CO)(PPh3)3] with improved activity. Carbonylation experiments were carried out in a 50 cm3 capacity stirred Hastelloy C-276 reactor (Autoclave Engineers, USA). Liquid reactants and products were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard GC (Model No. 5840) with an 8 ft long SS column packed with 5% OV-17 on Chromosorb W(AW), while the gaseous products were analyzed using a 10 ft long Porapak Q column. Ruthenium complexes RuC^PPI^ [II], traOTs-Ru(CO)2Cl2(PPh3)2 [11] and H2Ru(CO)(PPti3)3 [12] were prepared using the literature procedure, NCL communication No. 4911.

The elemental analysis was found to agree within + 2% of the expected values. Carbonylation of methyl acetate was carried out using acetic acid as a solvent, and the results obtained for different catalysts are presented in Table 1. It was observed that RuClg SHgO was the least active catalyst. By using ruthenium complexes such as (raTis-RuCCC^aClgCPPI^a and RuClgCPPl^g, the activity as well as the selectivity to acetic anhydride was improved substantially. However, the most active catalyst precursor was H2Ru(CO)(PPh3)3. In order to verify the role of hydridoruthenium complexes, reactions were carried out with RuCls-SHgO, RuClgCPPl^a and trans- RuCCCOaClaCPPI^a in the presence of Ha. In all cases except RuCls-SHgO, a considerable increase in the activity was observed (see Table 1). It was observed that the performances of HgRuCCO^PPI^a catalyst with pure CO as feed and (rawi-Ru(CO)2Cl2(PPh3)2 and RuClgCPPl^a with CO/Ha as feed were comparable, indicating that the hydridocarbonyl ruthenium complex may be the key intermediate in the catalytic cycle. However, the activity of H2Ru(CO)(PPh3)3 was not further increased by addition of Ha. In no ex- periments were side products by homologation (e.g. ethyl acetate) detected. Analysis of the gas phase was carried out in all the experiments, in which the formation of methane and dimethyl ether in varying amounts was observed in all cases. The results are shown in Table 1. Thus ruthenium complexes have been shown to be active and selective catalysts for carbonylation of methyl acetate at 513 K and 68 atm pressure. Hydrogen has also been shown to promote the activity of the Ru complex catalysts. These are preliminary results; further work on this subject is in progress. References 1 Ger.
