Of the above-mentioned catalysts, MgO/ BaCO3 composite catalyst possesses the highest activity and selectivity. In a comparison of single component samples with the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst, it is shown that there is considerable interaction between the two components in the catalyst. The interaction leads the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst to have the correct 02- ion concentration and their distribution, lower lattice oxygen mobility, strong basicity of surface and lower specific surface areas to favor OCM. A C2 yield of 16.3% and selectivity of 68% was obtained at 1053 K, CHn/air= 1, GHSV = 3.88 104 h-1 over 0.25 g 62 mol% MgO/BaCO3 catalyst during a 530 h stability test. Studies of the reaction conditions indicate that a C2 yield higher than 18% could be obtained under properly selected reaction conditions. Experiments using a 26.4- mm diameter fixed-bed reactor with 10 ml MgO/BaCO3 catalyst show that a C2 yield of 16.3% and a C2 selectivity of 65% was obtained with a catalyst bed temperature of ca. 1200 K, CH4/O2 = 5 and methane GHSV = 5000 h- ' with 1.8 ml/min water as a diluent.

Da et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 as: (1) the inhibition of the complete oxidation of methane and C2 products to elevate C2 selectivity at a high single-pass conversion of methane, (2) the prepa- ration of catalysts with good stability, (3) removing the heat produced from the strongly exothermic reaction, and (4) the design and fabrication of chemically inert reactors that can be used at temperatures > 1000 K [ 1 ]. Previous literature on this area has demonstrated that alkaline-doped alkaline earth metal oxides [ 2- 6] possess high activity and C2 selectivity for the reaction. However, these catalysts can easily deactivate due to the evaporation of alkaline metal elements during operation at high temperatures. Further study is still needed to find catalysts that are composed of relatively cheap components which are stable at high temperatures and have a good activity and selectivity. Yamagata et al. [7] studied BaO mixed with CaO or MgO as methane oxidative catalysts, however, BaO can easily form B a(OH) 2 with water during the reaction, and Ba (OH) 2 can erode the reactor during the reaction. Dissanayake et al. [ 8 ] recently reported that over 2 mol-% Ba/MgO, a methane conversion of 17% and a C2 selectivity of 80% were obtained at 1123 K, CH4/O2 = 10, and XPS analysis illustrated that there was a good correlation between the 02- concentration on the surface and the coupling activity. They concluded that 02- ions, or perhaps O- ions derived from 02- are responsible for the activation of methane via homolytic C-H bond cleavage. However, there are few reports on the investigation of the stability, effects of additives such as water, and obtaining high C2 yields in a larger reactor. We have found that a series of bi-alkaline earth composite catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane exhibits good activity and C2 selectivity in a microcatalytic fixed-bed reactor. Of these catalysts, MgO/BaCO3 was found to be the best [9]. The present work was undertaken to study the relationship between the catalytic performance and the composition, structure and basicity of MgO/BaCO 3 composite using XRD, BET, XPS, CO2-TPD and the CO pulse reaction. The stability of the catalyst and the effects of the reaction conditions on the performance of the catalyst were also investigated. Experiments using 10 ml catalyst samples were carried out in a 26.4 mm diameter reactor and revealed the potential industrial prospects of this catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and testing The catalysts were prepared by crushing and mixing a calculated amount of Mg(OH)2.4MgCO3.6H20 (A.R., Beijing Chemical Factory) and BaCO3 (A.R., Experimental Factory of the Shanghai Chemical Institute) in water. The slurry was dried overnight and calcined at 1073 K for 4 h, particulate size; 24-50 mesh. The catalytic tests on the catalysts were carried out in a conventional flow fixed- bed system under atmospheric pressure. A reactant of CH4/air = 1 was cofed to a quartz reactor of 6 mm I.D. with 0.25 g catalyst. The reactor used for testing the J.

Schematic view of the reactor used in the microcatalytic test. catalyst is shown in Fig. 1, a quartz capillary with 1 mm I.D. was located in the center of the reactor to accelerate the flow of the reaction products out of the high- temperature region to inhibit deep oxidation of methane to carbon oxides. Experiments with 10 ml of catalyst were performed in a quartz reactor of 26.4 mm I.D. X 600 mm length. Two layers of porcelain paticles were placed at the front and back ends of the catalyst bed in the middle of the reactor. The length of the catalyst bed was 20 mm and the catalyst paticle sizes used in the tests were 20-30 mesh. Two ovens were used to preheat and heat the reactor. The cofeed reactants were natural gas with methane (more than 95 mol-% after desulphurization) and pure 02 ( > 99.9%) without further purification. Whereas the OCM is a strongly exothermic reaction, and heat transfer is more difficult for the 10 ml fixed-bed reactor than the microcatalytic reactor, a small amount of steam (preheating to ca. 573 K) was added to the reactant to control the temperature of the catalyst bed and inhibit the complete oxidation of methane. The reactor was connected to a conven- tional flow system. The temperature was measured by Ni/Cr-Ni/AI thermocouples at five points, which were located in the preheating and reaction sections (at the outside of the reactor wall), the centers of the top, middle and bottom of the catalyst bed, respectively. The vent gases were analyzed by GC with a thermal conductivity detector, and a Porapak P and a 13X molecular sieve columns were used to separate carbon dioxide, ethylene, ethane and oxygen, nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, respectively. The methane conversion and selectivities of C2, CO and CO2 were calculated upon the basis of the mole percentage of methane converted to each product. J. Da et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 2.2 C02-TPD and CO pulse reaction CO2-TPD was performed in a 45 ml/min He flow with a heating rate of 20 K/ min after the catalysts were treated at 1073 K in a He flow for one hour and then allowed to adsorb CO2 at room temperature. Pulse reactions were performed in a He flow of 45 ml/min by introducing a 0.3-ml 99.999% CO pulse via a six-way valve after the catalyst was treated at 1073 K for one hour. The effluents were analyzed using an on-line Finnigan Mat 700 ion trap detector (ITD). 2.3. Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed on a D-MAX-RB diffractometer with Cu Ka-radiation. BET N2 specific surface areas were measured on a Carlo ERBA Soaptomatic surface area analyzer. XPS measurements were carried out using a VG ESCALAB 210 system, with Mg Ka radiation. The base pressure in the main chamber was 4.5 10-11 mbar. All the analyses were performed at a pass energy of 25 eV in a large area mode. The sample was pressed into a 15 1 mm thick self-supporting disk. Calibrations of binding energy were based upon the C ls peak of adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV. The concentration of each element was calculated using a Fisons Eclipse Data System, Version 1.4. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Performance of different bi-alkaline earth metal oxide composites for the OCM reaction Many studies on alkaline earth metal oxides were carried out on alkaline/alkaline earth metal oxides composites, such as Li/MgO and Na/CaO [ 1-6,10]. The dis- advantage is that these catalysts can easily lose alkaline elements which lead to Table 1 Performance of OCM over varies bi-alkaline earth composites Reaction temp. = 1053 K, CH4/O2 = 1,0.25 g catalyst, F= 160 ml/min, catalysts prepared by slurring method Catalysts CH4 conv.

Da et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 deactivation. Since alkaline earth metal compounds, i.e., MgO, CaO, SrCO3 and BaCO 3 are stable compounds, having strong basicity as well as higher melting points than the reaction temperature for OCM, we expect them to have good activity as well as stability. Table 1 shows the results of OCM over different bi-alkaline earth composite catalysts. It can be seen from the results that all of these composites have a high activity and C2 selectivity for OCM. Table 1 also shows that the MgO/ BaCO 3 catalyst has the highest C2 yield of all the catalysts, and the melting points of MgO and BaCO3 are much higher than the reaction temperature. 3.2. The effects of the MgO contents on the activity of the MgO/BaC03 catalyst The catalytic performance of the MgO, BaCO 3 and MgO/BaCO3 catalysts (Fig. 2) indicates that MgO has a relative high activity but a low C2 selectivity, while BaCO3 has a low activity but a high C2 selectivity. The MgO/BaCO 3 catalysts have both a high activity and selectivity for OCM. The C2 yield of the catalyst is higher than that of the single components. XRD analyses (Fig. 3) show that the catalysts are only composed of MgO and BaCO3, no new phase was detected. The specific surface areas of the MgO/BaCO3 catalysts increase with increasing MgO content. The results in Fig. 2 show that the MgO catalyst with a larger surface area leads to complete oxidation, whereas BaCO 3 with a smaller surface area reduces the activity strongly. Fig. 2 further shows that a large porous size and a small surface area benefit selective oxidation. Since no new phase exists in the catalyst, and the performance of the catalyst is superior to MgO or BaCO3, it is shown that the cooperation of BaCO3 with MgO adjusts the surface structure of MgO/BaCO3 to suppress the complete oxidation and improve both activity and C2 selectivity. The best catalytic performance is obtained over 62 mol-% MgO/BaCO3 (abbr. to MgO/ BaCO3), which exhibits a C2 yield of 17.3% and a selectivity of 72.4%. 0 C ~E A ~2 y,ela i __e > - 'd 0 r..9 ~ . -'~ ..... s'o ...... \"1 MgO contents, mol~ Fig. 2.

Effects of different reaction conditions on the performance of OCM Fig. 4 shows the effects of reaction temperature on the performance of the MgO/ BaCO 3 catalyst. Both methane conversion and C2 selectivity increase with temper- ature. These results are in good agreement with the conclusion obtained in several experiments that a higher temperature elevates the activity of the catalysts and benefits the selective oxidation due to the great differences in the activation energies for C2 and COx formation. The three-dimensional map of C2 vs. partial pressures of methane and 02 (Fig. 5) demonstrates that an optimizing C2 yield can be obtained under properly selected J.

It is clearly seen from Fig. 5 that there are two peaks of C2 yield, one peak corresponds to a higher methane partial pressure and a rather low 02 pressure which is favorable to the C2 selectivity and increases the C2 yield, the other corresponds to a higher 02 and a moderate methane partial pressure which is favorable to methane conversion and C2 yield. From the map the highest C2 yield can be expected to exceed 18% under properly selected reaction conditions. 3.4. Stability test of the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst The results of the 530 h stability test of the catalyst (Fig. 6) show that the bi- alkaline earth composite MgO/BaCO3 catalyst is very stable during the reaction. XRD analysis shows that there is no change of the structure of the catalyst after a run of more than 500 h. The stable results of OCM over 0.25 g MgO/BaCO 3 catalysts at 1053 K, GHSV = 3.88 10 4 h- t and CH4/air = 1 in a 6 mm I.D. reactor without water as a diluent are a C2 yield of 16.3% and a C2 selectivity of 68%. 3.5. Results of a catalytic test of a lO-ml catalyst using a 26.4 mm diameter fixed- bed reactor Since the OCM is carried out at high temperatures and the reaction is strongly exothermic, in the 10-ml catalyst reactor, the control of the reaction temperature is very difficult. In order to remove the reaction heat and inhibit methane and C2 complete oxidation to COx, a small amount of steam was added to the reactant. The results in Table 2 show that the C2 yields without steam in the cofeed are lower than those with steam, and increasing the 02 partial pressure only elevates methane conversion slightly but reduces the C2 selectivity considerably. The C2 yield is J. Da et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 240::7 26037 28037 30037 32037 ' // ' ~o37 28037 z3037 30037 3zo37 SC/klLIE 1:1386 I 1 I ! i ... \\ ,,. -o&o: Fig. 5. The map of C2 yield as a function of CH4 and 02 partial pressure. considerably affected by the temperature of the catalyst bed. However, simply increasing the control temperature of the ovens does not lead to a high C2 yield, since there is a large temperature gradient in the catalyst bed when steam is not added. The temperature differences between the top and the bottom layers of the catalyst bed are usually greater than 80 K when no steam is added and it seems that methane just reacts in the top layer of the catalyst bed. A relative higher C2 yield can be obtained when a properly adjusted amount of steam is added and the temperature of the ovens is elevated; in this case the temperature differences are less than 80 K. However, it is not true that the introduction of more steam always leads to a higher C2 yield, since too much steam can cause a decreasing in the temperature of the catalyst bed a well as in the methane conversion.

C02-TPD and CO pulse reactions Since the basicity of the catalysts play an important role in OCM [ 11], the basicity and base strength distribution were measured by CO2-TPD (Fig. 7). The base strength can be measured by the desorption temperature, and the amount of basic sites can be measured by comparing the desorption peak areas. MgO gives three desorption peaks at 470, 515 and 718 K, respectively, which indicates that J. Da et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 MgO . + MgOIBaC~III~ I I ! I 465 830 765 960 11O0 Temperature. K Fig. 7. The CO2-TPD profiles. pure MgO is a moderate base. The area of the peak at 718 K is the largest and is probably due to the large specific surface area of MgO. In contrast, only a small amount of CO2 desorbed from BaCO 3 at a temperature higher than 950 K. This means that the base sites on BaCO 3 are very strong, whereas their number is relatively small, since the specific surface areas of BaCO3 are very small. The CO2- TPD results of the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst indicate that a considerable amount of CO2 desorbed continuously in the temperature range from 900 to 1100 K. These results indicate that the basic sites and the strength of basicity on the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst lie between those of MgO and BaCO3. The results suggest that the coop- eration between MgO and BaCO3 can reduce the moderate basic sites and increase the strong basic sites and lead to an improvement of the C2 selectivity and yield. It is clear that there must be a significant relationship between basicity and activity of the catalyst. The state of the oxygen on the surface depends on the rate of oxygen diffusion. The oxygen diffusion rates can be measured by the reduction of the CO content [ 12]. The results of the pure CO pulse reactions over MgO, BaCO 3 and MgO/ BaCO 3 at 1073 K (Fig. 8) show that the amounts of CO2 formed from CO pulses on the s .amples are in the order: MgO >> MgO/BaCO3 > BaCO 3. This means that the oxygen diffusion rate in MgO is much faster than those in BaCO3 and MgO/ BaCO3, while MgO/BaCO 3 << MgO is possibly due to the decrease of the mobility of lattice oxygen through doping MgO with BaCO3. It is interesting to note that the CO2 baselines over-BaCO3 and MgO/BaCO3 increase step by step after each CO pulse, while that over MgO remains constant. This indicates that the interaction of gaseous CO2 with MgO is weaker than with MgO/BaCO3 and BaCO3, and an equilibrium involving surface carbonation and decarbonation may exist on the MgO/BaCO3 and BaCO3 surfaces. This is in agreement with the basicity measure- ments. J. Da et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 -g *6 C02,xl 6 ....... , 1 2 3 pulse No. Fig. 8.

Results of XPS analyses In order to explore the surface composition and clarify the surface active species, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a VG ESCALAB 210 system. Although the XRD analyses indicate that there was no new phase detected in the catalyst, the surface composition and species were quiet different between MgO, BaCO3 and the catalyst. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the XPS spectra in the O ls and C ls regions for pure MgO, BaCO3 and MgO/BaCO3 catalysts, respectively. The O ls peaks can be deconvoluted into two peaks, the peak at 529.2 eV is assigned to lattice oxygen 02-, the peak at 531.1 eV may contain contributions from oxygen in both CO 2- and peroxide 02- [8,13]. The C Is peaks at 289.3 eV and at 284.6 eV are due to the carbon in CO 2- and adventitious carbon respectively. The atomic ratio of the oxygen-to-carbon contribution due to CO 2- is 3 for the pure BaCO 3 sample (see Table 3).

It can be inferred that some 02-ions exist on the surface of the catalyst. Table 3 shows the surface composition of MgO, BaCO 3 and the catalyst. The 022- atom-% for MgO, BaCO 3 and the catalyst are 7.0%, 0.4% and 7.6%, respectively, and the methane conversion over MgO, BaCO3 and the catalyst are 20.0%, 0.9% and 23.9%, respectively, while C2 selectivities are 63.0%, 87.5% and 72.4%, respectively.

The XPS characterization of the Ba/MgO catalysts by Dissanayake et al. [8] confirmed that oxidative coupling activity is directly related to the capability of the catalyst to form surface 022- ions existing in a BaO2 phase. They postulated that Ba/MgO catalysts at sufficiently low Ba loading (from 0.2 to 4.0 mol-%), for which the BaOx remains uniformly distributed and well dispersed, and BaCO3 are more easily thermally decomposed into an active BaOx phase. However, in the present work we found the concentration of surface O ]- ions existing in pure MgO catalyst to be almost the same as in the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst. The difference between our work and Dissanayake et al. [8] is probably due to the preparation of catalysts by different methods. The ratio of Mg 2+ to Ba 2 + on the surface of the catalyst is about 7, greater than the calculated ratio in bulk of about 1.7. It is shown that Mg 2+ is enriched on the surface. Whereas the methane conversions over both the MgO and MgO/BaCO3 catalysts are about the same, MgO may be the active component for methane activation. It seems likely that surface O~- ions are formed on the surface oxygen vacancies of MgO. However, the mobility of lattice oxygen in MgO/BaCO3 is much slower than in MgO, while the C2 selectivities over MgO/BaCO3 ( 72.4% ) are higher than MgO ( 63.0% ). We believe that the lower mobility of lattice oxygen prevents complete oxidation leading to en enhancement of the C 2 yield and selectivity. On the other hand, BaCO 3 as an inactive well dispersed component on the surface could separate active oxygen species to improve the distribution of surface oxygen species for OCM. Combined with the above-mentioned characteristics, it can be concluded that there is a con- J. Da et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 81-94 siderable interaction between MgO and BaCO3 in the catalyst. The interaction leads the catalyst to have the correct 02- ions concentration and their distribution, lower lattice oxygen mobility, strong basicity of surface and lower specific surface areas to favor methane oxidation. Conclusion Studies on bi-alkaline earth composite catalysts indicate that these new catalytic systems have good activity and selectivity for methane oxidative coupling. Of the above mentioned catalysts, MgO/BaCO3 composite catalyst has the highest activity and selectivity. From a comparison of single-component samples with the MgO/ BaCO3 catalyst, it can be revealed that there is a considerable interaction between the two components in the catalyst. The interaction leads the MgO/BaCO3 catalyst to have the correct 02- ions concentration and their distribution, lower lattice oxygen mobility, strong basicity of surface and lower specific surface areas to favor OCM. A C2 yield of 16.3% and selectivity of 68% was obtained at 1053 K, CH4/ air= 1, GHSV = 3.88 104 h- 1 over 0.25 g, 62 mol-% MgO/BaCO3 catalyst dur- ing a 530-h stability test. Experiments using a 10-ml reactor also indicate that the catalyst has a good activity and C2 selectivity.
