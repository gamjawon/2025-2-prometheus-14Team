Preparation of zirconia-supported Mn(-K) and Co(-K) catalysts was carried out by (co-) impregnation of zirconia pellets to incipient wetness. Characterization of the fresh catalysts was performed using nitrogen adsorption, electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The dehydrogenation of l-butene was used as a catalytic test reaction. It was shown that catalysts containing finely divided cobalt oxide or manganese oxide homogeneously distributed over zirconia supports can be prepared using a pre-shaped zirconia support. From the results obtained with various characterization techniques it was concluded that preparation using complex organic precursors results in the best dispersion of the active phase. The metal-EDTA complex seems the most suitable for producing the desired catalyst systems. Catalysts without potassium carbonate deactivate due to carbon deposition. The deactivation behaviour of supported cobalt oxide is similar to that of supported iron oxide, while supported manganese oxide shows a more gradual deactivation. The Mn- or Co-based catalysts containing potassium carbonate did not show deactivation up to at least 10 h on stream. The activity and selectivity are different, however.

Introduction The use of a supported catalyst can be a solution for the mechanical deterioration by the structural transformation of Fe203 to Fe304 of the presently applied bulk oxide dehydrogenation catalysts [ 1-5]. Zirconium dioxide (zirconia) can be a successful alternative catalyst support material for application in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene [6]. In the present paper the concept of the development of a supported catalyst is evaluated in an alternative way. Lee [7] has reported that the combination of iron-potassium oxide provides the most active catalyst in unsupported dehydro- genation catalyst systems, as compared with, e.g. K-Mn-O, K-Co-O or K-Zn-O, but no satisfying explanation for the unique properties of K-Fe-O catalysts was presented. Presumably the behaviour of the K-M-O system with M = Fe differs from the systems with M = Co, Mn, Zn, etc. The analog of potassium ferrate (III) (KFeO2), which is reported to be the active phase in the iron oxide catalysts [5,8-10], may not be formed under reaction conditions in catalysts containing Co, Mn or Zn. The formation of potassium cobaltate (III) (KCoO2) [11] and potassium manganate (III) (KMnO2) [ 12,13] has been shown to be possible, but their stabilities under dehydrogenation conditions (e.g., 600-650; 30 vol.-% steam) are unknown. Furthermore, the reactant and product hydrocarbons might be adsorbed differently or less strongly on the oxidic materials which are formed in the systems with Co or Mn. Another explanation might be that the supply of potassium to the surface, which is reported to proceed from the bulk matrix (e.g. from K2Fe22034) acting as a storage medium [10], may not be as efficient with the other metal compounds. The polymanganite KMn8016 can be formed already at 300-400 [ 14], but whether this compound can act as a potassium supply or can even exist under dehydrogenation conditions is not known. If the difference in activity is not related to any mixed K-M-O compounds, the adsorption of reactants or products on the various oxides could be altered by the mere presence of the added potassium compound on the surface. E.g. Maltha et al. [15,16] found that the presence of Kon the surface of Mn304 catalysts enhances the dissociative adsorption of aromatics on the catalyst surface. If the adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbons proceeds differently on the surface of iron oxide/potassium and, e.g., manganese oxide/potassium, this could also explain a difference in the catalytic activity. L.A. Boot et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 71 These explanations for the observed activity ranking are, nevertheless, rather speculative since few experimental data are reported on catalysts containing 'alternative' active components [7]. To evaluate some of the above explanations, it would be helpful to establish whether substitution of the bulk matrix by a support material influences the formation of the (supported) active phases and the catalytic performance of the supported alternative active components. Using a pre-shaped zirconia support, cobalt oxide- and manganese oxide-based cata- lysts have been prepared, characterized, and tested in 1-butene dehydrogenation. This enables a comparison with the supported iron oxide-based catalysts and allows us to investigate the influence of a support on these oxide systems. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a pre-shaped zirconia support (Daiichi RSC-H, 100% monoclinic, pellets, O 3 mm [6]). The support pellets were treated at 850 in air for 16 h to obtain a stable specific surface area of about 20 m2/g and a pore volume of about 0.25 ml/g. In some cases a fresh, as-received support was used also, to investigate the influence of the support pre-treatment. Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2.6H20, Merck, p.A.) or man- ganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)24H20, Merck, p.A.) were used as precursor compounds; aqueous precursor solutions were added to evacuated support bodies to establish a loading of ~< 3 wt.-% Co or Mn. Higher loadings were obtained by multiple impregnation, with intermediate drying and calcina- tion steps. Catalysts were also prepared using a sugar solution of the metal salts as described by Van de Kleut [17]. Metal nitrates were dissolved in combination with saccharose (crystal sugar, Suiker Unie) in a molar ratio of saccharose/nitrate of 0.11. Finally, catalysts were prepared using the metal-EDTA complex solutions. The metal nitrates were dissolved in their crystal water at about 60 to maximize the metal concentration and thus the attainable loading in one step (max. about 1 wt.-% metal). EDTA (Titriplex, Merck) and an ammonia solution (25%, Lamers and Pleuger, p.a.) were added to the stirred, hot solution in portions to prevent excessive foaming. The total amount of EDTA was adjusted to obtain a molar ratio of M/EDTA of unity. After addition of the required amount of EDTA, the pH was adjusted to 5 with the ammonia solution. Potassium containing samples (typically ~< 3 wt.-% K) were prepared by sequential impregnation of calcined cobalt- or manganese-on-zirconia catalysts 72 L.A. Boot et aL / Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 ex sugar/nitrate with potassium carbonate (Merck, p.A.) or by co-impregnation of the bare support with a solution containing the metal EDTA complex and potassium nitrate (Merck, p.A.). Co-impregnation with a solution containing the metal salt and potassium carbonate as carried out with iron-on-zirconia catalysts [6], cannot be performed due to the fact that cobalt and manganese carbonates are hardly soluble and will precipitate from the impregnation solution. The viscous impregnation liquid was allowed to enter the support pellets for about 1 h at static vacuum (0.5 kPa). The catalysts were dried rapidly in flowing air (25 1/min) at room temperature for about 2 h. Most catalyst samples were calcined in flowing air using the following procedure: 150 for 2 h; 500 for 2 h; 750 for 16 h (ramp between stages: 5/min). The catalysts containing saccharose were calcined differently to prevent explosions due to the violent reaction with nitrate: the samples were dried for about 160-170 h at 90, after which calcination in flowing air was carried out via the same procedure as mentioned above. Between the isothermal stages the temperature was raised carefully in steps of 20 per 15 minutes. Physical mixtures of pretreated zirconia and CO304 or Mn203 containing 3 wt.-%of the metals were prepared by manually grinding and mixing the compo- nents in a mortar. The metal oxides were prepared separately by calcining the metal nitrates (vide supra) in air at 750 for 16 h. 2.2. Characterization techniques 2.2.1. Light microscopy Cross-sectioned pellets were examined in a Leitz light microscope to deter- mine the macroscopic distribution of the applied active metal oxide phase after impregnation, after drying, and after calcination. 2.2.2. Transmission electron microscopy For electron microscopy, samples were prepared by applying a few droplets of a dispersion of a finely ground catalyst ultrasonically treated in ethanol onto a holey carbon film supported by a copper grid. Samples were investigated in a Philips EM420 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV, primarily by bright-field techniques. 2.2.3. Determination of textural properties The specific surface areas of the bare supports and of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen physisorption at liquid nitrogen temperature according to the BET method. A surface area of 0.162 nm2 for the physically adsorbed N2 molecule was used for calculation of the BET surface area. Measurements were carried out by static physisorption (ASAP 2400, Micromeritics); this technique also provides a pore size distribution up to 100 nm and information on the L.A. Boot et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 73 microporosity of the samples (t-plot method). Fractured samples with a particle size of 0.425-0.150 mm were outgassed at 200 for 2 hours prior to the measurements. 2.2.4. Powder X-ray diffraction Powder XRD was carried out in a Philips powder diffractometer mounted on a Philips PW1140 X-ray generator with Fe K,~l,2 radiation (1.93735 ,~). 2.2.5. Temperature-programmed reduction Reduction experiments were carried out in an atmospheric (plug-) flow reactor using a thermal conductivity detector to monitor hydrogen consumption. Water produced in the reduction reaction was frozen out using a CO2 (s/g) cold trap. A fractured catalyst sample was reduced in a 50 ml/min 10% or 70% v/v H2/Ar gas flow, while the temperature was changed from RT to about 900 with a linear heating rate of 5/min. 2.2.6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Spectra of powdered (potassium) manganese-on-zirconia catalysts were recorded on a VG Microtech XP Spectrometer equipped with a Clam II hemispherical analyzer, using a Mg-source (1253.6 eV) operated at 10 mA. For correction of shifts in binding energies due to charging, the Zr 3ds/2 line at 182.4 eV [18] was used. To calculate peak areas, backgrounds were subtracted according to a procedure suggested by Shirley [19]. From the measured intensi- ties of the lines originating from the applied active component(s) (Mn,K) and the metal of the support material (Zr) the fractional coverage of the support material was determined using the XPSCAT computer program developed by Gijzeman [20]. This program is based on the method as described by Kuipers et al. [21]. 2.2.7. 1 -Butene dehydrogenation Catalytic dehydrogenation experiments were carried out in an automated apparatus as described earlier [3,5,6]. Calculations of conversion, selectivity to product i, and yield of product i were carried out in the same manner as was done elsewhere [6]. A gas mixture (atmospheric pressure) of 5 vol.-% butene (Hoek Loos, 2.5), 30 vol.-% steam (added by passing the gas flow through a saturator kept at 70) in nitrogen (Hoek Loos, 5.0) yielding a steam/oil ratio of water/1-butene = 6 (mole/mole), was passed upwards through the catalyst bed, which had previously been heated up to 600. Typically about 1 g of catalyst was used at a gas flow rate of 50 ml/min, resulting in a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.35 g/g h. 74 L.A. Boot et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst preparation, examination by light microscopy and TEM The catalysts were examined with light microscopy at different stages during the preparation, viz., after impregnation, after drying, and after calcination. For catalysts containing Mn or Co only, the use of the metal nitrate precursor resulted in egg-shell distributions of the applied components after calcination. The distribution after impregnation and drying could only be determined with great difficulty or not at all, due to the very light yellow or pink colour of the added materials. However, this result resembles the egg-shell distribution ob- tained when impregnating the zirconia support with the iron (III) nitrate precursor [6]. The observed inhomogeneous distribution after calcination became apparent also when studying the catalysts with transmission electron mi- croscopy. TEM micrographs show an inhomogeneous distribution throughout the sample, in which the active component has been deposited in clusters of finely divided crystals next to the support material. It can be concluded that the use of a nitrate precursor when preparing zirconia-supported catalysts generally leads to egg-shell distributions. However, the observed phenomena could also be related to the pore structure of this particular carrier. When the support pellets had been impregnated with the metal nitrate/sugar solutions, the distribution after calcination was found to be homogeneous. This is in agreement with observations made by Van de Kleut [17] characterizing alumina-supported manganese catalysts. No unsupported clustered material was observed with TEM. The entire catalyst bodies, however, seemed to have a lower mechanical strength after calcination. With light microscopy, large pores at the external edge of the longitudinally sliced samples could be observed after calcination. The violent reaction between the metal nitrates and saccharose must have caused the deterioration of the catalyst pellets, in spite of the careful and time-consuming calcination procedure. This deterioration of the catalyst bodies was not reported by Van de Kleut, perhaps because the support used in his study had a much higher pore volume (1.1 ml/g vs. 0.25 ml/g). The rapidly expanding gases could therefore have escaped from the pellets more easily. With the metal-EDTA precursor, the obtained distribution was also homoge- neous after impregnation, after drying, and after calcination. The homoge- neously grey-coloured catalyst bodies did not show altered mechanical proper- ties, however. No newly formed macropores could be observed with light microscopy, and upon crushing the bodies appeared to have retained their original mechanical strength. With catalysts containing cobalt a slightly inhomogeneous distribution was observed with light microscopy after sequential impregnation with potassium carbonate. No indications for the formation of a K-Co compound were found, in contrast with the supported K-Mn catalysts (vide infra). Co-impregnation L.A. Boot et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 75 with cobalt EDTA and potassium nitrate resulted in a homogeneous macroscopic distribution of the deposited phases. The manganese catalysts that contained also potassium showed a different behaviour depending on the applied potassium precursor compound. With catalysts containing manganese the sequential application of potassium carbon- ate resulted not only in an inhomogeneous potassium distribution, but also in the formation of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) during calcination. This was demonstrated by suspending the powdered catalyst bodies in water, which caused a dark purple colouring of the water. The formation of the permanganate could have been expected, since this compound can be synthesized by treatment of lower valent (potassium) manganates with CO2 [22]. When co-impregnation of the Mn-EDTA complex and potassium nitrate was performed, the presence of potassium permanganate after calcination could not be demonstrated: suspen- sion in water did not lead to any colouring. The obtained potassium distribution appeared to be homogeneous over the entire support body. At the centre of some bodies, a dark green phase was observed after the body had been sliced. This green colour, which changed to brown upon exposure to atmospheric air, may be indicative of the formation of an unstable mixed K-Mn compound. The compounds which are known to be dark green contain MnO~'--ions (x = 1-4), such as K2MnO4, and are reported to decompose to dark brownish phases upon exposure to air [22]. Hence, such a mixed K-Mn-O oxide is presumably present in the as-calcined catalysts. Summarizing, it can be stated that both metals cobalt and manganese behave rather similarly when comparing the results of the various preparation methods: both metals can be applied homogeneously with a solution of the metal-EDTA complex and show an egg-shell distribution when nitrate is applied. Only when potassium is applied also, some slight differences can be noted. A mixed K-metal compound is formed with manganese depending on the impregnation method. 3.2. Catalyst characterization 3.2.1. Nitrogen physisorption The textural properties of the various catalysts have been investigated using nitrogen physisorption. Loading the catalysts with 1 to 6 wt.-% of the transition metal causes a slight decrease in the specific surface area of 5-10% with all catalysts, typically from about 20 m2/g to 19-18.5 m2/g. Addition of potas- sium resulted in a larger decrease: e.g., catalysts containing 3 wt.-% of the transition metal and 3 wt.-% K ex sugar/nitrate showed a surface area of +60% of the initial surface area (typically 11.5-12 m2/g) after calcination. The drop in the surface area can be attributed to the mere presence of potassium, which causes the surface area to decrease linearly with potassium loading. The calculated micropore areas decrease about 35-50% upon addition of potassium, 76 L.A. Boot et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 e.g., from about 6 to 4 m2/g with 1% Mn, 1% K/ZrO2 and from 4.0 to 1.9 m2/g with 3% Co, 3% K/ZrO2. The decrease of the specific surface area and the micropore area was present with all precursor compounds and has also been observed with the catalysts based on iron oxide [6]. 3.2.2. X-ray powder diffraction From the powder diffraction patterns of the catalysts after calcination, the resulting metal oxide phase can be determined with certainty only with the catalysts containing I> 3 wt.-% of the transition metals. At lower loadings, no diffraction peaks from the applied phases were observed. With cobalt containing catalysts, Co304 turned out to be present, which is expected from the literature [23-25] and from thermodynamics [26,27]. With increasing loading the strongest diffraction maximum (311) of Co304 observed at d = 2.44 A becomes more pronounced, in a similar manner as was observed for Fe203 in the iron-on-zirconia catalysts [6]. The (311) peaks have been used to calculate the crystallite sizes using the Scherrer equation [6]. Larger crystallite radii are calculated for the 3 wt.-% and 6 wt.-% Co catalysts ex nitrate, viz., 20 and 35 nm, respectively, than for the catalysts of the same loading ex sugar/nitrate, viz., 15 and 25 nm, respectively. This indicates that the phases applied using the sugar solution are better dispersed over the zirconia support, which is in agreement with the results obtained with TEM. For the catalysts containing manganese, the resulting phase is a-Mn203. This phase is expected to be present after calcination in air at 750 [ 17,28]. Again, X-ray diffraction peaks are only detected with the catalysts containing >/3 wt.-% of the metal. The size of the manganese oxide crystallites as determined from the line broadening of the (222) peaks showed the same trend as was found for the supported cobalt oxide samples. Large crystallite radii are observed for the 3 and 6 wt.-% Mn catalysts prepared from the nitrate precursor (11 nm and 16 nm, respectively), whereas in the diffractograms of the catalysts prepared from sugar/nitrate solutions the peaks were too small to determine the line broadening. Again, this confirms that the phases applied using the sugar solution are better dispersed over the zirconia support. When potassium is impregnated sequentially as the carbonate or co-impreg- nated with cobalt EDTA as the nitrate, the CO304 (311) peak is still visible in the catalysts containing cobalt. The crystallite radius of the corresponding phases were calculated to be about 15 nm for both precursors. Though the size is smaller than in the catalysts without potassium, the occurrence of this Co304 peak indicates that the formation of a mixed K-Co compound has not occurred during calcination. In catalysts containing manganese and potassium a-Mn203 diffraction peaks cannot be discerned, neither with the nitrate nor the EDTA precursor. This suggests that with these catalysts the manganese containing phase is better dispersed. Perhaps this is connected with the intermediate L.A.

Temperature-programmed reduction profiles (70% hydrogen in argon) of a 3 wt.-% Co/ZrO2 catalyst (ex sugar/nitrate), a (3 wt.-% Co, 3 wt.-% K)/ZrO2 catalyst (ex sugar-Co nitrate/potassium carbonate) and of a physical mixture of cobalt oxide (Co304) and zirconia containing 3 wt.-% Co. formation of a mixed K-Mn oxide as occurs similarly in catalysts containing potassium and iron [4,6]. This would be in accordance with the observations made with light microscopy after calcination of the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalysts. 3.2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction Since the catalysts ex nitrate all display inhomogeneous distributions of the active phase, a thorough characterization of these catalysts with TPR was considered to be less useful. Preliminary TPR experiments performed with the Mn/ZrO2 catalysts ex nitrate showed that the profiles obtained were very similar to the profiles described by Van de Kleut [17] for poorly dispersed alumina-supported manganese oxide ex nitrate. The poor dispersion of catalysts prepared with nitrate solutions is in agreement with the results obtained with TEM and XRD. TPR profiles of the catalysts which were prepared using organic precursors are presented in Figs. 1-4. The supported cobalt-based catalysts without potassium (Figs. 1 and 2) show an onset of the reduction reaction in their TPR profile at about 250, irrespective of the used reducing gas mixture.

[23,29] display similar onset temperatures for Co/AI203 catalysts. Comparison of the profile of 3 wt.-% Co/ZrO2 ex sugar/Co nitrate with that of the physical mixture indicates that complete reduction with the supported catalysts is achieved at temperatures about 80 to 100 higher than that of the physical mixture. The more difficult reduction can be attributed to the fact that in the catalyst the cobalt oxide particles are present in a dispersed state on the catalyst surface, or rather, in the pore system of the support bodies. Examination of the profiles measured with the two different H 2/Ar mixtures, suggests that in both mixtures the reduction of the supported cobalt oxide proceeds in two steps. The steps can be attributed either to two different cobalt oxide species present in the catalyst, or to the reaction steps of the reduction reaction of Co304 via CoO to Co As was also noted by Brown et al. [29], no discrimination can be made between these two possibilities. The final extent of reduction of the Co/ZrO2 samples was calculated to be 100%, which demonstrates that cobalt oxide ultimately is reduced to the metallic state. Addition of potassium leads to an even more difficult reduction to metallic cobalt. This influence of potassium was also noted with the catalysts based on -4 i p 0 200 400 600 Temperature () K-Mn L Mn' q 800 1000 Fig. 4.

Boot et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 79 iron oxide [6]. The onset temperature is not significantly increased. In 70% H2/Ar, the reduction of potassium carbonate is detected at high temperatures (Fig. 1). The reduction of zirconia-supported manganese oxide catalysts starts at about 150 (cf. Figs. 3 and 4), which is in agreement with the literature [17,30,31]. Supported manganese oxide catalysts exhibit a lower onset temperature of reduction than the corresponding manganese oxide in a physical mixture. This has been observed previously for MnOx-on-zirconia [31 ] and for y-alumina-sup- ported manganese oxide catalysts [17]. An explanation for the more facile reduction has not been presented as yet. However, it is obvious that the dispersed Mn3+ species have reducibilities different from that of bulk man- ganese (III) oxides. A difference in the defect structure of the small Mn203 moieties facilitating the nucleation and growth of a Mn2+ phase in the panicles may be responsible for the lowered onset temperature of reduction. The catalysts containing manganese are reduced to MnO, which can be calculated from the final extent of reduction. The reduction to MnO is generally acknowledged in the literature [17,30,32,33], but can also be deduced from the green colour of the samples after completion of the TPR experiments. The fact that MnO results after reduction (O/Mn = 1) can be used to characterize the stoichiometry of well-dispersed supported MnOx catalysts from their initial O/Mn ratio [17]. The initial O/Mn ratios calculated from the integrated TPR profiles are all about equal to 1.5, indicating that in the 1 wt.-% Mn catalysts ex EDTA and the 3 wt.-% Mn catalysts ex sugar/nitrate the manganese phase is present as Mn203, as was also derived from the powder diffractograms of the 3 wt.-% Mn/ZrO2 catalyst. Assignment of the various reduction peaks to steps in the reduction reaction or separate manganese oxide species is speculative. Reduction of Mn203 to MnO is likely to proceed via Mn304, but these steps do not correspond to the relative peak areas observed in Figs. 3 and 4. This is probably due to either the complicated reduction behaviour of manganese oxides or the reduction of differently dispersed manganese oxide species, as was already discussed for supported cobalt oxide. No significant differences between catalysts prepared using the two organic precursors can be derived from the TPR profiles in Figs. 3 and 4. The reduction profiles resemble those reported by Van de Kleut [17] for the 'organic precur- sors' (Mn EDTA, Mn citrate, sugar/nitrate), but also the profile published by Koh et al. of 5 wt.-% Mn/ZrO2 which was prepared by impregnation with Mn nitrate [31]. The latter catalyst is likely to display a better dispersion than the catalysts ex nitrate investigated in this work, since the support of Koh et al. had a specific surface area of 65 m2/g, which is significantly higher than that of the support used in the present study. The amount of atoms Mn per nm2, which can determine the final metal oxide dispersion to a large extent [6], is therefore lower with Koh's samples. 80 L.A.

The onset temperature of the reduction of Mn,K/ZrO2 catalysts is shifted to higher temperatures (by about 50) due to the presence of potassium, which was discussed earlier for the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts [6]. The shift of the onset temperature has been reported for supported manganese oxide catalysts by Baronetti et al. [32]. The TPR profiles of the Mn,K/ZrO2 samples prepared with potassium carbonate (Fig. 3) and potassium nitrate (Fig. 4) reflect the difference between the two potassium precursors already observed after prepara- tion. Catalysts ex sugar/nitrate and potassium carbonate are completely reduced at lower temperatures, since higher valent manganese is present in these samples, which is reduced at low temperatures. In the samples ex EDTA/potas- sium nitrate, complete reduction is achieved more difficulty, as was the case with catalysts containing cobalt or iron. 3.2.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The catalysts containing manganese oxide were characterized with XPS to determine their relative dispersions, depending on the applied precursor and the support pretreatment. The XP spectra of catalysts prepared with nitrate (1, 3 and 6 wt.-% Mn) and with EDTA (1 wt.-%, on a support precalcined at 850 and a fresh, as-received carrier) were used. The support coverages and corresponding particle sizes are presented in Table 1. It can be deduced from the data given in Table 1 that the catalysts ex nitrate are not as well dispersed as the catalysts prepared with the EDTA precursor. An equal support coverage is only established with manganese nitrate at six times the amount of impregnated manganese. Consequently, the calculated particle sizes are significantly smaller with the EDTA precursor. The support coverages and particle sizes are comparable to the values calculated for the iron oxide-on- zirconia catalysts reported elsewhere [6]. Probably the support coverage has not reached its threshold value in the 1% Mn/ZrO2 catalyst (about 20 to 25% if the value of Fe/ZrO2 is valid here). Another observation is that using the fresh, as-received support does not result in a significantly different value for the L.A.

Also in TPR experiments this was observed: almost identical reduction profiles were measured for catalysts pre- pared with or without a support pretreatment. The particle sizes for the Mn/ZrO2 catalysts calculated from XPS are in agreement with the radii calculated from XRD. Unfortunately, the support coverages could not be determined using the computer program for catalysts containing potassium also. There are no distinct manganese, potassium or K-Mn compounds in the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalysts, and since the program requires the input of distinct chemical compounds with their corresponding stoichiometries and specific densities, this impairs the calcula- tions. 3.2.5. Butene dehydrogenation The zirconia-supported catalysts based on cobalt and manganese were tested in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene at 600. The typically observed conver- sions and selectivities as a function of time for Co and Mn catalysts are presented in Fig. 5. The curves for the catalysts to which potassium had been added are shown in Fig. 6. As expected, catalysts without potassium deactivate, most presumably due to carbon deposition. When the isothermal plots for the catalysts without potassium are compared with those of iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts [6], it can be seen that the conversion and selectivity plots for the Co and Mn catalysts resemble the plots measured for Fe-based catalysts strongly. Fig. 5 also shows the two stage deactivation behaviour, which was due to the combined effect of a progressive reduction of the supported oxide and carbon deposition. Initially, the metal oxide phase is being reduced, thus producing CO2 which compensates for the loss in conversion of butene to butadiene due to carbon deposition. In the second stage, the metal oxide is reduced and carbon deposition only prevails, until total deactivation is reached [6]. 82 L.A.

The behaviour of the supported Co oxide and Mn oxide catalysts is quite similar. No significant influence of the dispersion of the supported phase, viz., in the catalysts ex nitrate and ex sugar/nitrate, can be noted, so the behaviour for catalysts ex nitrate is shown only. Deactivation is complete within about 3 h. After that period of time, the activity and selectivity of a surface covered completely with carbon is exhibited [6]. The product yield distributions showed the same tendencies as for the Fe/ZrO2 catalysts [6]. Carbon dioxide and propene were the major by-products. The CO2 production is initially high due to reduction of the supported metal oxide, and decreases until after 3 h the reduction has been finished. When potassium is also present in the catalysts, the behaviour of the two active components is different. However, both catalysts (Co-based and Mn-based) show no deactivation during the imposed times-on-stream (cf. Fig. 6). No significant influence of the used metal precursor was found. 100 ,= 80 _u o , 60 \"E 40 3- O 20 0 400 Selectivity ~ :\" ~\"t~ ~-~'A~-~.~ I K'Fe,~ ~ m~l 450 500 550 600 Temperature () 650 Fig. 7. l-Butene conversion and 1,3-butadiene selectivity versus temperature for zirconia-supported cobalt oxide (squares) or manganese oxide (circles) catalysts with potassium (3% wt.-% metal ex sugar/nitrate, 3 wt.-% K).

For comparison also the curve of a Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst (3 wt.-% Fe, ex citrate, 3 wt.-% K) is plotted. The cobalt oxide-based catalyst shows a steady butene conversion of about 17%, combined with a selectivity of about 70%. This is significantly lower than the values obtained for the manganese/potassium-on-zirconia catalyst. This catalyst displays a conversion of 27-29% combined with a selectivity of about 80%. The latter conversion values are comparable to those of the iron oxide based catalysts. In order to compare between the performance of the cobalt oxide and manganese oxide catalysts ex sugar/nitrate and that of the iron oxide-based catalyst studied earlier [6] temperature-programmed activity plots have also been measured. These are represented in Figs. 7 and 8. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that the activity of the Mn,K- and Co,K-on-zirconia catalysts is lower than that of the catalysts based on iron oxide, as was already expected from the isothermal plots at 600. The temperatures at which 40% conversion is reached (T4o [5,6]) are 609 and 621 for the Mn,K/ZrO2 and the Co,K/ZrO2 catalysts respectively. The corresponding values for $4o, the selectivity at T40, are 76% and 60%, respectively. For the iron-based catalysts the values of T4o and $4o were 600-610 and 60-63%, respectively. Comparison with the supported Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst with the same iron and potassium loading shows that both the Mn,K and Co,K catalysts are less active than the former catalyst. The isomerization activity is equal to that of the iron oxide-based catalysts. The cause of the lower activity is therefore presumably not a decreased adsorption of butenes. The low activity and selectivity of the Co,K/ZrO2 catalyst as compared with the iron-based catalyst is caused by its lower butadiene yield (Fig. 8) at equal yields of the non-selective reaction products, i.e. propene and CO2. This results in the observed (calculated) lower butene conversion and in a lower (calculated) selectivity. Hence, a lower butene dehydrogenation activity seems the reason for its less favourable performance. The catalyst containing manganese and potassium is just slightly less active 84 L.A. Boot et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 than the Fe,K/ZrO2 system, but shows a higher selectivity. Its higher selectivity is caused by a lower oxidation or gasification activity: the CO2 yield with this catalyst is about 50% of that of the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst. The higher selectivity of the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalyst results in a higher yield at temperatures above 550. A possible cause for the lower selectivity shown by the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts is carbon deposition in smaller mesopores or micropores [6]. However, the Mn,K/ZrO2 samples show comparable textural characteristics (BET sur- face, micropore surface). It was shown, however, that a homogenous distribution of the applied active components on the support surface is required to prevent carbon deposition. The stability of K-Mn-O compounds may lead to a more extensive coverage of the zirconia support, which leads to a better distribution of potassium within the reduced manganese oxides. Finally, from the temperature-programmed butadiene yield plots the apparent activation energies Ea and the logarithms of the pre-exponential factors ln(k0) were calculated. These amounted to 164 kJ/mol and 21.6 for the Co,K/ZrO2 catalyst and to 172 kJ/mol and 24.2 for the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalyst, respectively (units of k0: atm min- l - l gcatalyst)\" The experimental error in the determination of the activation energies is about 6-8 kJ/mol [6]. The catalysts based on iron oxide all show an apparent activation energy which is significantly lower, viz., 145-155 kJ/mol. No information concerning the active phase in the catalysts based on Co oxide or Mn oxide is available, however. The catalysts have been analyzed with XRD after performing the dehydrogenation reaction, but no diffraction peaks other than due to the support and potassium carbonate could be discerned. 4. Further discussion and conclusions It was shown that homogeneously distributed zirconia-supported cobalt oxide or manganese oxide catalysts can be prepared using a pre-shaped zirconia support. From the results obtained with various characterization techniques (XRD, XPS) it can be concluded that preparation using complex organic precursors (sugar/nitrate and EDTA) yields the best dispersion of the active phase. The catalysts prepared from the sugar solution showed a decreased mechanical strength due to violent reactions of the precursor compounds during calcination. Application of the metal-EDTA complex seems therefore more suitable for preparation of the desired catalyst system. However, a lower metal loading in one impregnation step can be applied with this precursor. The use of potassium carbonate to add potassium promoter resulted in the formation of potassium permanganate (VII), which can be extracted with water from the calcined catalyst. Since this is rather undesirable for the application of the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalysts, potassium nitrate has to be used. The catalysts without potassium deactivate in the catalytic dehydrogenation of L.A. Boot et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 137 (1996) 69-86 85 1-butene due to carbon deposition. The deactivation proceeds similarly to that of supported FeOx. The stability of the catalysts with potassium was shown to be similar to that observed with the iron oxide-based catalysts: no deactivation can be noted up to about 10 h on stream. The activity ranking of Fe,K > Mn,K > Co,K is the same as reported by Lee [7]. So, the replacement of the bulk metal oxides by the supported catalysts does not change the order in the observed activities. The combined effect of the lower conversion and higher selectivity for the Mn,K/ZrO2 catalyst leads to a butadiene yield which is higher than with the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst at temperatures above 550. Whether the lower activity of the Mn and Co-based catalysts is related to the presence or absence of a mixed K-M-O phase cannot be decided from the experiments performed in this study, since the active phase in the Co and Mn based catalysts under reaction conditions is yet unknown.

Preparation of zirconia-supported Mn(-K) and Co(-K) catalysts was carried out by (co-) impregnation of zirconia pellets to incipient wetness. Characterization of the fresh catalysts was performed using nitrogen adsorption, electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The dehydrogenation of 1-butene was used as a catalytic test reaction. It was shown that catalysts containing finely divided cobalt oxide or manganese oxide homogeneously distributed over zirconia supports can be prepared using a pre-shaped zirconia support. From the results obtained with various characterization techniques it was concluded that preparation using complex organic precursors results in the best dispersion of the active phase. The metal-EDTA complex seems the most suitable for producing the desired catalyst systems. Catalysts without potassium carbonate deactivate due to carbon deposition. The deactivation behaviour of supported cobalt oxide is similar to that of supported iron oxide, while supported manganese oxide shows a more gradual deactivation. The Mn- or Co-based catalysts containing potassium carbonate did not show deactivation up to at least 10 h on stream. The activity and selectivity are different, however. The activity ranking was found to be Fe,K > Mn,K > Co,K. The selectivity of the manganese oxide-based system was found to be higher than in the iron oxide-based catalyst.

        "dc:description": "Zirconia-supported dehydrogenation catalysts based on manganese oxide and cobalt oxide were investigated. Preparation of zirconia-supported Mn(-K) and Co(-K) catalysts was carried out by (co-) impregnation of zirconia pellets to incipient wetness. Characterization of the fresh catalysts was performed using nitrogen adsorption, electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The dehydrogenation of 1-butene was used as a catalytic test reaction. It was shown that catalysts containing finely divided cobalt oxide or manganese oxide homogeneously distributed over zirconia supports can be prepared using a pre-shaped zirconia support. From the results obtained with various characterization techniques it was concluded that preparation using complex organic precursors results in the best dispersion of the active phase. The metal-EDTA complex seems the most suitable for producing the desired catalyst systems. Catalysts without potassium carbonate deactivate due to carbon deposition. The deactivation behaviour of supported cobalt oxide is similar to that of supported iron oxide, while supported manganese oxide shows a more gradual deactivation. The Mn- or Co-based catalysts containing potassium carbonate did not show deactivation up to at least 10 h on stream. The activity and selectivity are different, however. The activity ranking was found to be Fe,K > Mn,K > Co,K. The selectivity of the manganese oxide-based system was found to be higher than in the iron oxide-based catalyst.",
