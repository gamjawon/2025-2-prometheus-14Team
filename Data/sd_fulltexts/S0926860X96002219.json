Navarro, B. Pawelec, J.L.G. Fierro, P.T. Vasudevan * lnstituto de Cat{tlisis y Petroleoqufmica, CSIC, Campus UAM, Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain Received 11 December 1995; revised 2 May 1996: accepted 7 June 1996 Abstract Unpromoted and Pt, Pal, Ni and Ru-promoted molybdenum catalysts supported on amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) were characterized in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene, and their activities were compared with a commercial Pt/ASA catalyst. The catalytic activity was found to increase in the following order: commercial Pt/ASA >> PtMo = NiMo = RuMo > PdMo --- Mo = ASA. Characterization of the catalysts by XPS, TPR, and FI'IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and pyridine confirmed that incorporation of 16.1 wt.-% Mo, minimized to a large extent the metal-support interaction, and decreased the acidity of the catalysts; although for the Ni-catalyst, the formation of Ni aluminate (and silicate) was not prevented. The incorporation of promoters enhanced molybdenum surface exposure and decreased the reduction temperature of MOO3; and for the Ni-promoted catalyst, increased the amount of sulfidable Ni species. Pd was not very effective as a promoter due to its poor dispersion, and the presence of a low percentage of active sites in the PdMo catalyst. For binary samples, a correlation was found to exist between the dispersion of MoS2 phases, the number of active sites titrated by NO, and the HDS activity of the sulfided samples.

Navarro et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 desulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT). The interesting results ob- tained in their study provides a strong incentive to investigate the activity and selectivity of Mo catalysts combined with certain metal sulfides as promoters. In a new generation of hydrotreating catalysts, two routes have been followed in which the nature of the support and/or that of the active phase have been varied, with the aim to develop new catalysts for a second or third stage deep HDS process. The approach undertaken in this work consists in the use of amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) as a catalyst support because it displays greater acidity compared to conventional alumina [2,3], and has been documented in a few instances to enhance the rate of sulfur removal [4]. Although a high acidity tends to favor coking [2], the catalysts supported on ASA have the advantage of a low metal-support interaction compared to those supported on alumina. On one hand, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) makes it easy to prepare highly dispersed MoS2, which then remains stable during the reaction; on the other hand, it is undesirable as it induces the formation of new surface species through solid state reactions of promoter and molybdenum oxide at the alumina inter- face. These latter species becomes difficult to sulfide, and therefore these catalysts show lower HDS activity. However, minimizing the metal-support interaction in catalysts by using silica-aluminas as carriers (by increasing the SiO2 content), also leads to a decrease in HDS and hydrogenation (HYD) activity [2,3,5-7]. The poor dispersion of active phases has usually been described as the principal reason for activity decay, because these supports with high silica loadings exhibit less basic -OH groups that are able to react with molybdates during impregnation [8]. Moreover, the molybdenum oxide struc- tures formed after calcination possess more basal planes and a lower quantity of defects. This can be a disadvantage as the latter are much more easily sulfided than the former, and after sulfiding, they are the effective active sites of HDS catalysts [9]. In view of the observed discrepancies between HDS activities of molybde- num supported on silica-alumina [2,3,5-7] and commercial Pt/ASA catalysts, this work was undertaken with the objective to cover the ASA surface as much as possible by incorporating large amounts of MoO3 prior to promoter addition. Therefore, the sulfided molybdenum phase, in addition to its role in enhancing activity, should be regarded as a support for the promoter, enabling the promoter to be optimally dispersed. However, considering the high silica content of this support (Si/A1 = 0.62), MoO3 tends to form tridimensional structures [5] in- stead of forming a MoO3 monolayer covering the ASA carrier. Despite the fact that the large Mo loading selected (16.1 wt.-% Mo) is not of direct commercial interest, the elucidation of the mutual influence of the modified acidic ASA carrier by MoO3 and of the noble or semi-noble metal promoters, could be helpful in increasing our knowledge of these type of catalysts. In order to obtain more information on the properties of M-Mo/ASA (M = Ru, Pd, Ni, Pt) R. Navarro et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 25 catalysts, they were extensively studied by temperature programmed reduction, photoelectron spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and pyri- dine. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) (Si/A1 = 0.62 atomic ratio, surface area -- 389 m2/g, pore volume -- 0.72 ml/g) was used as the support. Prior to Mo incorporation, the ASA extrudates were crushed to a particle size of 0.25-0.30 mm, then contacted with 50 ml of (NHa)6Mo7024 \" n20 (Merck, reagent grade) at a pH close to 7. After contacting the ASA support with the impregnating solution for 12 h, the excess water was removed in a rotary evaporator, the precursors were then dried at 383 K for 4 h and heated in a two step procedure: first at a rate of 4 K/min to 523 K and holding at this temperature for 1 h, and then at the same heating rate to 723 K followed by isothermal heating at that temperature for 2 h. The final Mo catalyst had a loading (determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)) of 16.1 wt.-% Mo. The binary M-Mo/ASA (M = Ru, Pd, Ni, Pt) and monometallic M/ASA (Ru, Pd, Ni) catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the Mo/ASA and blank ASA, respectively, with aqueous solutions of ruthenium(III) chloride (Sigma), palladium(II) nitrate dihydrate (Fluka), Ni(NO3)2.6H20 (Merck) and chloroplatinic acid (Sigma), respectively. The excess water was removed in a rotary evaporator and the impregnates were dried at 373 K in air for 4 h, and calcined at 573 K for an additional 4 h. The Mo content, determined by AAS, in the binary catalysts, PdMo, RuMo, PtMo, and NiMo was 15.9, 13.2, 12.7, and 12.8 wt.-%, respectively. The loading of promoter (Ru, Pd, Pt) in the binary catalysts and loading of Ru and Pd in the unpromoted catalyst was approxi- mately 1.0 wt.-%. The nominal Ni loading in the Ni-Mo and Ni catalysts was 1.6 and 7.9 wt.-%, respectively. A commercial Pt/ASA (0.95% Pt) catalyst was used as a reference. 2.2. Characterization techniques Molybdenum and promoter contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Perkin-Elmer 3030. The samples were solubilized in a solution of HF, HC1 and HNO3 and homogenized in a microwave oven at a maximum power of 650 W. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K over the whole range of relative pressures using a Micromerit- ics Digisorb 2600 automatic equipment on samples previously outgassed at 523 K. BET surface areas were computed from these isotherms using the BET 26 R. Navarro et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 method. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out in a Micromeritics 3000 analyzer interfaced to a data station. A 50 mg catalyst sample was reduced in flowing gas containing 10 vol.-% H2 in Ar at a total flow rate of 50 ml/min, and using a heating rate of 15 K/min up to a final temperature of 1273 K. Infrared spectra of adsorbed NO on sulfided Mo and bimetallic catalysts was used to reveal the nature of surface sites and to confirm possible metal-support or molybdenum-promoter interactions. The IR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 5ZDX Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer working with a resolution of 4 cm- ~ over the entire spectral range. The samples were pretreated in an IR cell fitted with greaseless stopcocks and KBr windows which allowed thermal treatments either in flow or under vacuum. The oxide catalyst samples (thickness ca. 10 mg/cm2) were sulfided in situ. The procedure basically consisted of heating the catalyst samples in flowing He at 673 K for 0.5 h, then exposing the samples to a HzS:H2 mixture (ratio 1:10) for 1 h at the same temperature, followed by purging in flowing He at 673 K for 0.5 h. The samples were then outgassed at 723 K for 1 h and exposed to ca. 30 Torr of NO at room temperature. For the IR study of acidity of sulfided ASA, Mo/ASA and M-Mo/ASA catalysts, pyridine was used as probe molecule. Prior to sulfiding, the sample-wafers were purged in a helium flow at 673 K for 0.5 h, exposed to a 10% H2S/H2 mixture at 673 K for 0.5 h and then purged again in He at the same temperature for 0.5 h. After outgassing at 723 K for 1 h, sulfided samples were contacted with approximately 2 Torr of pyridine, and then outgassed at 393 K for 1 h to remove the physisorbed pyridine. Photoelectron spectra were recorded with a Fisons ESCALAB 200R electron spectrometer equipped with a MgK X-ray source (hv = 1253.6 eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The X-ray source was operated at 12 kV and 10 mA. The catalysts used in the reaction were protected under isooctane in order to avoid contact with air, and than deposited into small stainless steel holders. The samples were pumped out to 10-5 Torr (1 Tort = 133.33 N/m2) before they were moved into the analysis chamber. The residual pressure in this ion-pumped chamber was maintained below 7- 10-9 Tort during data acquisi- tion. Each spectral region of the photoelectrons which was of interest was scanned a number of times to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Although surface charging was observed on all the samples, accurate binding energies (+ 0.2 eV) could be determined by charge referencing with the adventitious C l s peak at 284.9 eV. 2.3. Activi~ tests Hydrodesulfurization of DBT was performed in a high-pressure laboratory scale set-up equipped with a stainless steel fixed bed catalytic reactor (9.5 mm i.d. and 130 mm length). DBT was dissolved in decalin to obtain a 1 wt.-% R. Nat~arro et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23 40 27 solution. For the activity tests, 0.3 g of the catalyst with particle size 0.25-0.3 mm was used. Prior to the run, the system was kept under an inert atmosphere (N2), while the pressure was increased up to 30 bar; then the catalytic bed was heated to the desired temperature. Hydrogen and DBT were then fed to the reactor. The reaction conditions for the HDS of DBT were: temperature 523-593 K: total pressure 30 bar; H2 flow rate 7 1 (STP)/h and WHSV = 35 h-~. Liquid samples were analyzed by GC with FID (Varian chromatograph Model Star 3400 CX) equipped with a 30 m x 0.53 mm column with DB-1 (100% methyl-polysiloxane, J and W Scientific) as stationary phase, using an initial temperature of 313 K (for 1 min) and then heating at a rate of 18 K/min up to 473 K and holding at that temperature for 5 min. Activity was measured at four different temperatures: 523,553, 573 and 593 K running from the lowest to the highest temperature and maintaining the reaction for 1 h at each temperature. At each temperature, the purge of the liquid reservoir was carried out for 45 min, then the liquid effluent was collected for 15 rain and analyzed. Each value of total conversion is the average of three different analyses of the liquid product taken after 1 h time-on-stream at a given temperature. Once the reaction was carried out at a given temperature, the next temperature was reached while maintaining the catalyst in a flow of inert gas. In order to check if there was any deactivation of the catalysts, the activity was checked back at the lowest temperature (523 K) at the end of all the experimental runs. In addition to unreacted DBT, biphenyl (BP) and cyclohexylbenzene (CHB) were the only products detected. Total DBT conversion was calculated as DBT disappearance, and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrogenation (HYD) selectivities were defined as (BP)/(CHB + BP) X 100 and (CHB)/(CHB + BP) X 100, respec- tively. For the calculation of HYD, a sequential path was assumed (DBTD BP ---> CHB). The other pathway was neglected because the products 1,2,3,4-te- trahydrodibenzothiophene (THDBT) and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydrodi- benzothiophene (HHDBT) were not observed. The product dicyclohexyl (DCH) was also not detected. Arrhenius plots were obtained from the pseudo first-order rate constant kHDs, calculated from steady state conversions of DBT (1 h on-stream) at each temperature. 3. Results 3.1. Catalytic activi~ Fig. 1 shows the total DBT conversion on sulfided blank ASA, Mo and M-Mo (M = Ru, Ni, Pd, Pt) catalysts. A commercial Pt/ASA catalyst was used as the reference. A general observation was that the M-Mo/ASA catalysts were not significantly deactivated in the conversion of DBT; the activity checked at the end of a complete cycle of runs at different temperatures (not presented in 28 R.

Dependence of the overall DBT conversion with time time-on-steam. Reaction conditions were: P = 30 bar, T = 523-593 K, WHSV = 35 h-1. Fig. 1) was almost unchanged. Comparing values of total DBT conversion at 573 K (Table 1), it is clear that the commercial Pt/ASA catalyst is 2.5 times more active than NiMo, PtMo and RuMo; the activity decreasing in the order: Pt/ASA >> PtMo = NiMo = RuMo > PdMo -- Mo -- ASA. It appears that incorporation of Pt, Ni and Ru on Mo increases the total DBT conversion by approximately 50%. It is observed that the incorporation of molybdenum to the ASA support does not enhance the activity of the blank support. The binary catalysts did not display an Arrhenius dependence above a reaction temperature of 573 K. Only Pt, blank ASA and Mo catalyst showed an Arrhenius depen- dence. Accordingly, the activation energies in the temperature range 523-593 K were determined only for Pt, ASA and Mo catalysts, and their apparent activation energies in the disappearance of dibenzothiophene were found to be 83, 93 and 91 kJ mo1-1, respectively.

Reaction conditions were: P = 30 bar, T = 523-593 K, WHSV = 35 h- i. From Fig. 2, it appears that the hydrogenolysis of DBT is more favorable than hydrogenation of aromatic rings, which agrees with previous literature findings [10-12]. Generally, it is expected that the hydrogenation selectivity decreases with increasing reaction temperature, but this tendency was observed clearly only for ASA, Pt and Ni catalysts (Fig. 2). It can be seen that HYD selectivities for Mo and binary catalysts, with the exception of NiMo, are higher than that of the Pt and blank ASA carrier. The [CHB]/[BP] ratio at 573 K is highest for PdMo sample (Table 1). This means that incorporation of Pd to the base Mo catalyst leads to an increase in the hydrogenation capability of PdMo catalyst by about 7.5 times with respect to blank ASA. It can be observed that the HYD/HDS ratio is higher in the binary PtMo catalyst than in the commercial Pt catalyst (Table 1). 3.2. Textural analysis The shape of nitrogen isotherms (not presented here) for all catalysts and for the plain support was almost similar, and the hysteresis loop was indicative of the presence of mesopores. The strong decrease in BET surface area after deposition of Mo on ASA (from 389 to 156 cm2/g), observed in Table 2, is to be expected as the support surface is covered by a high molybdenum amount (16.1 wt.-%). For the binary M-Mo catalysts, BET areas are much higher than for the Mo catalyst, but lower than for the Pt catalyst. The increase in BET surface area for binary samples suggests that MoO3 crystals are redispersed during promoter incorporation as has been reported [6]. In general, incorporation of one or two metals leads to an increase in the average pore diameter. The MoO3 (JCPDS pattern 35-609) of crystal size 8.7 nm and MO17047 (JCPDS 30 R.

Furthermore, in the latter sample, PtO2 crystallites (JCPDS pattern 38-1355) with size 5.7 nm were observed. This allows us to conclude that molybdenum and promoter are very well dispersed in the other catalysts. 3.3. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed NO The IR spectra of sulfided Mo and M-Mo catalysts show characteristic bands at approximately 1790 and 1700 cm-~ (Fig. 3), typically ascribed to a pair of NO molecules coupled in the adsorbed state as dinitrosyl or dimeric (NO)2 structures on the same molybdenum site [13,14]. It was found that at least two different NO adsorption sites exist on Mo sulfided catalysts: triply and doubly coordination unsaturated Mo sites [ 15]. It must be noted that the NiMo catalyst spectra display an additional band at 1839 cm ~, assigned to the stretching vibration of NO monomer adsorbed on Ni-sulfide, probably on Ni3S2 clusters [16], as may be deduced from the spectra of sulfided Ni catalyst, which confirms the existence of a single band at ca. 1851 cm-l. Generally, the IR results show no changes in Mo-NO interactions regardless of the promoter as no significant shift in the position of the IR bands was observed (Table 1). As the intensity of the bands at about 1800 and 1700 cm-t varies from sample to sample even though the Mo content in all binary catalysts is similar, this suggests that the relative fraction of NO adsorption sites on sulfided Mo indirectly depends on Mo dispersion, and this can likely be improved by incorporation of a promoter. It is also observed that the intensity of the NO band at about 1800 cm-~ decreases as follows: RuMo > NiMo > PdMo = Mo. As a decrease in the intensity of the NO-Mo band with increasing concentration of Ni [13] is found, and as the Ni content is three times R.

Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine As is well known, silica-aluminas display Br~nsted and Lewis acid sites. This originates from the isomorphous substitution of tetravalent silicon by trivalent aluminium in the silica lattice [17]. In this study, the relative proportion of Br~Snsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites, expressed as the ratio of the intensity of the bands at approximately 1543 cm-1 and 1453 cm-~ [18], respectively, was determined with the aim to monitor the changes in acidity of sulfided binary 32 R.

The IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on Mo and binary catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. From Table 2, the B/L acidity ratio decreases according to: ASA > Mo > NiMo Pt --- RuMo >> PtMo -- PdMo. It can be observed that the decrease in B/L acidity ratio of sulfided Mo sample is lower than expected. Moreover, the changes in B/L acidity ratio in binary samples depends on the type of promoter. This is illustrated by the relatively high B/L acidity ratio of RuMo and NiMo catalysts, which contrasts with the very low ratio of PdMo and PtMo samples (Table 2). It appears that the decrease in B/L acidity ratio is due to a decrease in the Br~nsted acidity brought about by promoter incorporation, while the Lewis acidity remains unaffected after sulfiding of alumina supported catalysts [19]. This decrease in Brtinsted acidity has been confirmed for NiMo catalyst [201. Comparing the acidity of outgassed, reduced and sulfided ASA carrier and Pt catalyst (Table 2), it appears that the acidity of the catalyst is strongly influenced by catalyst pretreatment, as is demonstrated by the strong increase in the B/L acidity ratio either by reduction or by sulfidation with respect to the outgassed counterpart. This is due to the fact that -OH or -SH groups, which give rise to R. Navarro et al.// Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 33 BriSnsted acidity, are developed on the catalyst surface during reduction and sulfidation steps, respectively. It can be noted that reduction pretreatment of the ASA cartier enhances slightly the B/L acidity ratio, but this increase is much more marked upon sulfidation. On the contrary, reduction and sulfidation of the Pt catalyst give a similar response in B/L acidity ratio. This fact suggests that the H2S effect is mainly induced by the ASA cartier whereas the H2 effect is produced by metal phases. 3.5. Temperature programmed reduction In order to explore if a correlation exists between the reducibility of the oxidic precursor and HDS activity of the sulfided samples, as reported in the literature [9,21,22], temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for Pt, Mo and M-Mo catalysts were performed. The TPR profiles are displayed in Fig. 5, and data on the maximum temperature during reduction, are compiled in Table 2. The TPR profile of the ASA support (Fig. 5f) shows a hydrogen consumption peak at about 923 K, with a shoulder in the high temperature side (> 973 K), probably due to reduction of impurities on the carrier. The TPR profile of the Mo catalyst shows two peaks (Fig. 5a) at 733 K and 973 K, with 300'500'700'900'11'00'13'00 Temperature (K) Fig. 5.

Navarro et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 some broadening in the latter arising from impurities in the support. Both peaks were observed in all TPR profiles of the binary catalysts (Fig. 5). As the reduction of supported MoO3 species occurs in two steps (MoO3 ~ MoO2 MOO), the former peak can be assigned to reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+, and the latter to reduction of Mo suboxides to MoO [23]. Note that the former peak is shifted to lower reduction temperatures in TPR profiles of binary catalysts (Table 2, Fig. 5). This observation agrees with the fact that the reduction of MoO3 is catalyzed by traces of noble metals, such as Pt [24], Pd [24,25] and Ni [25]. Even considering the fact that the reduction temperature of MoO3 phase in the binary catalyst is much lower, it is still about 100 K above the highest temperature of reaction (593 K) employed in this study. This indicates that under the reaction conditions employed in this study, no significant MoO3 reduction can be expected. As peaks of PdMo, PtMo and NiMo catalysts are broad enough, it may be assumed that the two peaks are indicative of two reduction steps of the MoO3 phase, and these may overlap with the peaks of promoter and impurities of the support. In the profile of NiMo catalyst, two overlapping peaks are distin- guished: one indicative of NiO reduction and the other associated with a spinel NiA1204 phase. Furthermore, formation of the palladium hydride seems to be inhibited in PdMo catalyst (Fig. 5 profile c), which contrasts with the formation of this phase in Pd/ASA [26]. The uniqueness of RuMo catalyst is reflected in the appearance of a separate promoter phase (a sharp peak at 454 K) (Fig. 5b) from the other two peaks of Mo reduction, indicative of reduction of ruthenium phase [27]. 3.6. Photoelectron spectroscopy Photoelectron spectra of the transition element (Mo 3d5/2, Pd 3d5/2, Ru 3d5/2, Pt 3d5/2 and Ni 2P3/2) of mono and binary catalysts used in HDS of DBT were recorded in order to get an idea of the nature of exposed TMS species and also on the abundance of each element on the catalyst surface. The binding energies (BE in eV) of the cartier components were in the range: Si 2p, 102.9-103.4 eV and A1 2p, 74.7 eV. The S 2p core level at 162.0-162.5 eV was detected in all the samples, with the exception of the ASA carrier, and this is consistent with the formation of metal sulfides. The Mo 3d core level spectra of Mo catalyst was complex because of the overlapping contribution of the S 2s peak in the low BE region. Curve fitting procedures revealed the presence of two Mo 3d5/2 components: a peak at 229.4 eV, characteristic of MoS2 species, and a second minor one at 231.2 eV, which can likely be associated with Mo oxysulfide species (Fig. 6). The Pd 3d5/2 core level of Pd and PdMo catalysts displayed two components at 335.7 eV and at 336.9 eV, and these are ascribed to sulfided and non-sulfided Pd species, respectively [28]. Similarly, the Ru 3d5/2 level in Ru and RuMo catalysts showed two components: the first one at R.

For Ni and NiMo catalysts, the Ni 2p3/2 peak displayed two contributions (Table 3), the first at 853.8-854.1 eV, associated with nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) [31]; and the second one at 856.7-855.0 eV, due to non-sulfided Ni2ions in the NiA1204 phase [32], or a Ni-silicate; the proportion of the latter being very high (82%) in Ni sample. For the PtMo catalyst, the Pt 3d5/2 peak showed only a single component at 314.8 eV, which fits well with the BE of metallic Pt On the contrary, the Pt 3d5/2 core level of commercial Pt sample can be resolved into two components at 314.5 and 315.2 eV, and these two are attributed to Ptand PtS species, respectively [28].

Discussion In the hydrodesulfurization of DBT over unpromoted and promoted molybde- num catalysts, the hydrogenolysis reaction is dominant over hydrogenation (Fig. 2). In general, the prepared monometallic and bimetallic catalysts display lower activity than the commercial Pt catalyst (Fig. 1). As the monometallic Mo, Ni, Ru and Pd catalysts in general are less active [26] than the bimetallic counter- parts RuMo, NiMo, and PtMo, it can be inferred that differences in activities between commercial Pt and the binary catalysts are related to differences in the preparation methods. The structure-sensitivity of HDS reactions was confirmed by partial suppres- sion of the reactivity of ASA support by the high amount of molybdenum R. Navarro et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 37 employed in the preparation. The coverage of the ASA surface by MoO3 (16.1% of Mo) was confirmed by the strong decrease of BET surface area of the carrier (Table 2). This has been confirmed with dynamic low temperature oxygen chemisorption (LTOC) experiments on sulfided catalysts [33], which agrees with other literature findings [34]. Furthermore, although the Mo sample shows a lower S/Mo atomic ratio than expected (Table 4), it exhibits a relatively high proportion of MoS~ species, as derived from the fitting of Mo 3d core level spectra (80%, Table 3). It must be emphasized that the discrepancy in the S/Mo ratios and percentage of sulfided Mo derived from the analysis of Mo 3d profile may lie in the fact that a large amount of sulfur vacancies are generated when recording photoelectron spectra under a highly energetic X-ray flux impinging on the sample. Other than this, the presence of a second component in the Mo 3d5/2 profile at a binding energy of about 231.2 eV can be taken as conclusive evidence that a small fraction of molybdenum species remains unsulfided. Judging from the binding energy of this minor molybdenum component, which is in between that of MoO3 and MoS2 species, it can be tentatively assigned to oxysulfided Mo species, probably located at the support interface. It is likely that a small fraction of molybdenum oxide interacts with silica component of ASA to form tetrahedrally isolated, coordinated MoO3 species, which are more difficult to sulfide than the corresponding octahedral bidimensional and tridi- mensional MoO3 [34]. As the Mo catalyst shows a smaller decrease in the B/L acidity ratio with respect to the blank ASA than expected, it suggests that the OH groups are mainly located in the pores of ASA, where pyridine molecules are adsorbed, but these locations are not available for the metal particles. An alternative explana- tion is based on the development of SH groups at the edges of MoS2 slabs, as already demonstrated for alumina-supported Mo sulfide [20]. This latter explana- tion appears unlikely because S/Mo ratios were rather low for the sulfided Mo catalyst. Accordingly, it is inferred that the Brtinsted acidity, as indicated by the appearance of a band at 1543 cm- l, is located in positions other than edge sites of the MoS~ slabs. Moreover, the low activity of PdMo catalyst cannot be correlated with a lower B/L acidity ratio because its parent NiMo sample displays similar acidity, but is on the other hand, more active. As catalytic activities of the binary catalysts do not correlate well with B/L acidity ratio, this may confirm that the presence of Brtinsted acid sites are not a necessary condition in the HDS of DBT. A similar conclusion has been already advanced for thiophene HDS on Mo-based catalysts [35,36]. IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO confirmed that presence of MoO3 may prevent metal-support and Mo-promoter interactions as no shift in the position of IR bands of binary samples was observed (Fig. 3, Table 2). However, the incorporation of MoO3 to the carrier prior to incorporation of promoter does not exclude completely the interaction of the promoter with the surface. This is illustrated in the NiMo catalyst by the formation of a certain proportion of Ni 38 R. Navarro et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 aluminate (or silicate) phase (Table 3), although its extent is minimized with respect to pure alumina cartier. Similarly, TPR results demonstrate that incorpo- ration of Ru, Pt, Pd or Ni decreases by about 50 K the reduction temperature of the MoO3 phase, as reported in the literature for alumina and silica-supported Mo catalysts [21,22]. However, only for RuMo, PtMo and NiMo samples, there is an expected correlation between the reducibility of the oxidic precursor and the HDS activity of the sulfided samples [9]. This is not true for PdMo, which displays the lowest HDS activity. It may be speculated that this is due to a higher capacity of Pd for hydrogenation as confirmed by the large [CHB]/[BP] ratio (Table 1). Furthermore, the low catalytic activity of the PdMo sample cannot be linked to the presence of palladium hydride, as TPR results confirmed that the presence of the MoO3 phase avoids the formation of this phase in the PdMo sample (Fig. 5, profile c). Dynamic low temperature oxygen chemisorp- tion data for both unpromoted Mo and binary PdMO catalysts are essentially the same [33]. This may suggest that Pd in PdMo catalysts is not effective as a promoter due to its poorer dispersion and low surface exposure. In view of the better correlation of oxygen chemisorption data with catalytic activity, it appears that the XPS Mo/Si intensity ratio does not provide information about the lateral dimension of MoSz structures [37]. The origin of the differences in M/Si ratios for the bimetallic PtMo and NiMo catalysts when compared to that of the parent Pt and Ni monometallic may be due to textural changes in the PtMo, and to solid state reactions during the preparation of NiMo. For the PtMo sample, both Mo and Pt phases form large crystals on the ASA surface, as the promoter is forced to be deposited mainly on the outer surface of the catalyst particles (lower Mo/Si and Pt/Si ratios, Table 4). On the other hand, it appears that commercial Pt catalyst possesses even larger Pt crystallites (lowest Pt/Si atomic ratio, Table 4), opposite to what is observed on Ni-based catalysts. In the monometallic Ni sample, Ni reacts at the carrier surface through the solid state reaction with support components forming Ni aluminate (and silicate), more than one atomic layer thick. Because the nickel ions are uniformly distributed across the surface, its surface concentration is high. In the binary NiMo catalyst, Mo is expected to anchor on A1-OH sites of ASA during the first impregnation step with the Mo precursor salt. The great tendency of Ni2ions to react at the alumina surface makes Ni to diffuse toward the interface whereas Mo remains on the top. Some redissolution of Mo may occur during Ni incorporation in a consecutive impregnation step; the solubilized fraction being forced to precipitate on the top catalyst surface at the end of the drying process. Accordingly, the proportion of exposed Ni atoms is expected to be lower in the binary NiMo catalyst than in the monometallic Ni sample. As expected, the sensitivity of catalysts to sulfidation and reaction conditions is also different. Considering the extent of sulfidation of used samples, among other factors which influence catalytic activities, it appears that S/(M + Mo) R. Navarro et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 148 (1996) 23-40 39 atomic ratio of used NiMo catalyst is very low with respect to that of the PdMo counterpart (Table 4); although catalytic performance follows an opposite trend. This confirms that the sulfidation degree is only one of the factors influencing the catalytic behavior. It appears that the presence of MoO3 in binary samples enhances the extent of sulfidation of Ni species (Table 4). Also, the PtMo catalyst shows the promoter to be present in the metallic state, and possesses a low quantity of MoS2 species (Table 3); but its activity is similar to that of the RuMo and NiMo counterparts. A final remark to be made is that in the commercial Pt catalyst used in the reaction, both sulfided and metallic Pt species were found to be present in almost the same proportion. This can be attributed to a loss of S during reduction following sulfidation. It is suggested that the morphology of Pt crystallites and their distribution on the support can play a critical role in the HDS of DBT. Both the texture and morphology of the Pt particles in the binary PtMo catalyst seem to be altered by the presence of the Mo substrate. 5. Conclusions A direct relationship has been found to exist between NO (and 02) chemisorption and dibenzothiophene HDS sites. Incorporation of promoters (Pt, Pd, Ru, Ni) on a Mo/ASA based catalyst decreases the reduction temperature of MoO3 species, but results in an enhanced catalytic response only for RuMo, NiMo and PtMo catalysts. It was confirmed that Pd in the PdMo catalyst enhances hydrogenation selectivity, but is not effective as a promoter due to its poorer dispersion and low surface exposure. The incorporation of MoO3 in high quantity (16.1 wt.-% Mo) on ASA results in a decrease in the interaction of promoter atoms with the carrier surface. Similarly, the anchorage of a Mo oxide phase on the carder surface prior to promoter incorporation leads to a decrease in the Br(insted acidity. The partial coverage of the cartier surface by molybdena appears beneficial in the case of NiMo catalyst because it avoids, to a certain extent, the solid state reaction between Ni ions and substrate, in which case, the resulting phases are difficult to sulfide or reduce. The lower activity of the binary PtMo with respect to that of the commercial monometallic Pt catalyst suggests that both the texture and morphology of the Pt particles in the binary PtMo catalyst is altered by the presence of the Mo substrate.

Tel.: (+1-603) 862-2298; fax: (+1-603) 862-3747 Unpromoted and Pt, Pd, Ni and Ru-promoted molybdenum catalysts supported on amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) were characterized in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene, and their activities were compared with a commercial Pt ASA catalyst. The catalytic activity was found to increase in the following order: commercial Pt ASA ⪢ PtMo ≈ NiMo ≈ RuMo > PdMo ≈ Mo ≈ ASA . Characterization of the catalysts by XPS, TPR, and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and pyridine confirmed that incorporation of 16.1 wt.-% Mo, minimized to a large extent the metal-support interaction, and decreased the acidity of the catalysts; although for the Ni-catalyst, the formation of Ni aluminate (and silicate) was not prevented. The incorporation of promoters enhanced molybdenum surface exposure and decreased the reduction temperature of MoO3; and for the Ni-promoted catalyst, increased the amount of sulfidable Ni species. Pd was not very effective as a promoter due to its poor dispersion, and the presence of a low percentage of active sites in the PdMo catalyst. For binary samples, a correlation was found to exist between the dispersion of MoS2 phases, the number of active sites titrated by NO, and the HDS activity of the sulfided samples.

        "dc:description": "Unpromoted and Pt, Pd, Ni and Ru-promoted molybdenum catalysts supported on amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) were characterized in the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene, and their activities were compared with a commercial Pt ASA catalyst. The catalytic activity was found to increase in the following order: commercial Pt ASA ⪢ PtMo ≈ NiMo ≈ RuMo > PdMo ≈ Mo ≈ ASA . Characterization of the catalysts by XPS, TPR, and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and pyridine confirmed that incorporation of 16.1 wt.-% Mo, minimized to a large extent the metal-support interaction, and decreased the acidity of the catalysts; although for the Ni-catalyst, the formation of Ni aluminate (and silicate) was not prevented. The incorporation of promoters enhanced molybdenum surface exposure and decreased the reduction temperature of MoO3; and for the Ni-promoted catalyst, increased the amount of sulfidable Ni species. Pd was not very effective as a promoter due to its poor dispersion, and the presence of a low percentage of active sites in the PdMo catalyst. For binary samples, a correlation was found to exist between the dispersion of MoS2 phases, the number of active sites titrated by NO, and the HDS activity of the sulfided samples.",
