(Received June 1, 1987;accepted August 28,1987) Summary Al203-supported osmium catalysts were prepared from 083(00)12 and from K2[Os02(OH)4J. The cluster-derived catalyst was modified with potas- sium by an additional impregnation with K^CO^. The materials were phy- sically characterized by carbonyl infrared spectroscopy, temperature- programmed reduction and transmission electron microscopy. Isolated surface complexes were the majority species in the Osa-derived catalysts, their oxidation state being +2 after thermal treatment while Os(0) carbonyl species were formed after H2 reduction. These did not aggregate to metal particles due to the presence of the protecting CO ligands. Catalysts prepared from the potassium osmate compound behaved differently for different loadings. At low loading (1.6 wt.% Os) Os2\"*\" species were highly stabilized even after reducing treatments. CO turned out to be a more efficient reduc- ing agent than H2. In contrast, at high loading (4.2 wt.% Os) metal aggrega- tion was observed after H2 reduction, with average metal particle diameters of 1.8 nm. The major effect of potassium in these materials seemed to be blocking of the osmium species for CO adsorption at low temperatures (<300K). The formation of bicarbonate, carbonate and formate species was also detected during the adsorption of CO. These species may be involved as intermediates in catalytic reactions such as water-gas shift. Possible forma- tion routes of these species and the role of potassium are discussed. *0n leave from: Department of Modern Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China. **Permanent address: Department of Chemistry, Minia University, El Minia, Egypt. \"*'0n leave from: Laboratoire de Chimie Minerale, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.

The preference of one of these two classes of precursors over the other is still governed by the requirements of the catalytic applica- tion intended and therefore based primarily on specific advantages, reviewed recently [1,2]. The particular interest in catalysis by supported metal carbonyl clusters arises from the fact that multinuclear active centers can facilitate reactions requiring simultaneous activation of different parts of a reacting molecule on adjacent sites [3]. Moreover, metal cluster-derived catalysts may provide means of combining the high reactivity associated with heterogeneous metal catalysts and the high selectivity characteristic of some catalytically active metal complexes in homogeneous solutions. Catalysts obtained from osmium carbonyl clusters Os3(CO)i2 and Ose(CO)i8 exhibited activity towards a number of hydrogenation reactions, among them the important CO hydrogenation reaction [4]. Characterization studies performed on the catalysts were confined basically to monitoring the transformations of the osmium-containing species occurring during the thermal activation (in vacuum or in He) [5-9]. These studies have displayed rather contradicting results. Earlier investigations have demonstrated that the initial product of the interactions between Os clusters and the support at room temperature retain the cluster skeleton, which could be degraded at higher temperature (> 373 K) into interconvertible mononuclear Os2+(CO)3 and Os2+(CO)2 species. The Os2\"'\" state was evidenced by XPS measurements [10] and gas analysis measurements [7, 8]. In contrast. Collier et al. [5] have concluded that the initial interaction product at room temperature was composed of polynuclear Os cluster species having CO- and C-ligands which were formed by dimerization or trimerization of Ose units. The empirical formula suggested for these species was OSn(CO)anCi,n where 2.0 <a < 3.0, 0.1 < b < 0.4 and n has the most likely value of 12. These species would suffer no degradation at higher temperature. More recently [II], the forma- tion of cyclic aggregates [M(CO)2or3L ^th n > 2 was postulated. The differing results and structural views were related to the impor- tance of the degree of surface hydroxylation of the alumina supports em- ployed [5]. The role of surface OH groups was considered earlier, and was experimentally controlled [6] by showing that cluster degradation was very much inhibited on 7-^203 having only 17% of the totally possible OH groups present on the surface (dehydroxylation at 870 K). This observation was further supported by the use of a fluorinated A1203 surface affording an elimination of the most basic OH groups; in this case, the initial cluster compound was strongly stabilized on the support. The molecular structure of Os3 clusters anchored onto A1203 surfaces and the subsequent formation of 'ensembles' of Os2\"*\" complexes, as described earlier [6-10], was sup- ported by a recent EXAFS study [12]. 297 The present work was carried out with the goal (i) to better understand the performance of pure and K-modified Os/7-Al203 catalysts in CO hy- drogenation and water-gas shift reactions, and (ii) to compare complex salts and carbonyl clusters as precursors. Our principal task is to present and discuss results of physicochemical characterization studies of osmium- containing surface entities formed during thermal treatment in H; and CO atmospheres. To accomplish these objectives: (i) catalysts were prepared from osmium carbonyl cluster Os3(CO)i2 supported on pure and K.2C03-modified 7^203 and from the osmium complex salt K2[Os02(OH)4] supported on pure 7^203; to our knowledge, this latter salt has not been used previously as a catalyst precursor; (ii) the reduction behavior of these materials in H2 atmosphere was followed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR); (iii) the characteristics of CO ligands were monitored by infrared spectroscopy (IR). (iv) the formation of osmium aggregates was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). (v) the chemical unsaturation of osmium species was investigated by IR measurements of CO adsorption. Experimental Support preparation The 7^203 support was obtained by calcination in air of Condea Alumina Pural SB (boehmite type) at 1023 K for 20 h. The weight loss was 23%. This material was pelletized under a pressure of 200 kg cm\"2, ground and sieved. The particle size fraction 0.3 - 0.4 mm was calcined again in a static oxygen atmosphere (623 K, 790 mbar, 30 min) and then evacuated at the same temperature for 1 h (4 X 10~2 mbar). The oxygen calcination- evacuation cycle was repeated twice. The final product had a BET surface area of 140 m2 g~1. According to the applied calcination conditions, the 7-A1203 surface was highly hydroxylated [13]. K.2C03-modified 7-A1203 was obtained by heating a predried K2C03- impregnated sample in vacuum and in an oxygen atmosphere (790 mbar, 623 K) for 30 min. The K loading reached was 0.5 wt.%. Catalyst preparation The cluster Os3(CO)i2 was loaded onto pure and K-modified A1203 by refluxing the support in a hexane solution of the cluster according to the procedure detailed earlier [6,10]. The materials obtained were thoroughly washed with the solvent to remove unreacted and weakly adsorbed clusters, and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The potassium osmate compound K2[Os02(OH)4J was impregnated from an aqueous solution under nitrogen for ~ 10 min until the solution became colourless. The concentration of the solution was varied between 298 TABLE 1 Composition of the catalysts Sample Precursor Os content K content (wt.%) (wt.%) Aa K2[OsO,(OH)4] 4.2 1.74 Ab K2[Os02(OH)4] 1.6 0.68 B OS3(CO)i2-K2CC 3 1.6 0.50 C OS3(CO)i2 1.6 D KaCOa 2.6 0.03 and 0.09 mol I 1, depending on the desired composition of the final catalyst. After impregnation, the excess water was removed by evacuation at room temperature and the catalyst was dried at 373 K. Its colour was brown to grey and could possibly be explained by disproportionation of Os(VI) on the acidic centers of the alumina surface [14]. All catalyst samples were stored in sealed ampoules under nitrogen and exposed to air only during the short time period needed to prepare self- supporting wafers (vide infra}. The Os and K loadings of the supported samples are given in Table 1. Gases H;, CO, CO-i and N; were Linde products with a nominal purity of 99.997%. The gases were further dried and deoxygenated by flowing them through appropriate Oxisorb cartridges. Instrumentation IR spectra were recorded at a resolution of 5.3 cm\"1 on a Perkin- Elmer 580 B spectrophotometer; the wavenumber accuracy was 2 cm\"1. Self- supporting wafers (10 mg cm\"2) were obtained by pressing the powder at 200 kg cm\"2. They were mounted in IR cells (CaFa windows) specially designed for in situ treatments and chemisorption experiments at room [15] and low temperatures [16]. TPR experiments were performed with samples (typically 500 mg) placed into a flow microreactor (inner diameter: 12 mm, height of the catalyst bed: 8 mm) in a Ha/He stream (see Table 2) in the temperature range 298 - 773 K. The temperature was measured with a chromel/alumel thermocouple placed in the center of the catalyst bed. The hydrogen con- centration was continuously measured through a Pd diffusion cell (N2 stream) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (Carle Model 100). Two on-line gas-chromatographs equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a thermal conductivity detector were used for analysis of hydrocarbons and CO, CO 2, respectively. In preparation for examination by high-resolution TEM, the catalyst powder was subjected to grinding and suspended in hexane. A drop of the 299 suspension was then placed on a 4 run carbon film mounted on a 1000 mesh Cu grid, and the hexane allowed to evaporate. The micrographs were obtained with a Philips EM 400 T microscope with an instrumental magnification of between 170000 and 220000 times and an acceleration voltage of 120 keV. To improve the contrast, the objec- tive aperture was reduced to ca. 30 Jum, which led to a restriction of the spatial frequency spectrum in the electron microscopic image and a restric- tion of the phase contrast to < 0.3 nm. Results and discussion Os^(CO) ^-derived catalysts Os3(CO)i2-derived catalyst samples B and C (Table 1) were character- ized by IR spectroscopy in the carbonyl stretching region after in situ thermal treatments in a stream of H; (50 cm3 min~1) at various temperatures (298 - 773 K) for 1 h. The carbonyl spectra obtained display reorganizations and transformations of the CO ligands occurring throughout the course of the Hz treatment. The IR carbonyl spectra obtained for sample C and KzCOa-modified sample B were almost identical, showing the weak influence of the potassium cation on the decomposition of the osmium cluster in a Hz atmosphere. Therefore, the spectra shown in Fig. 1 for sample B are also representative for sample C. Spectrum (a) obtained at room temperature displays five bands at 2110, 2070, 2054, 2022 and 2010 cm\"1. These bands compare well with sets of bands observed by several research groups previously [6 - 9,17,18], and which have been explained as being due to the product of a formal redox reaction with one or two hydroxyl groups of the support (o-OH), forming thus the species I or II: Os3(CO)i2 + lo-OH > Os3(CO)io(At-H)(JH-0-o) + 2CO (1) I Os3(CO)i2 + 2o-OH > Os3(CO)io(JU-0-o)2 + 2CO + H, (2) II The cluster integrity during this surface reaction has been supported by recent EXAFS studies [11,12] although disagreement still exists regarding the formation of structure I or II. At increasing temperature, the original spectrum disappears and two intense bands build up at 2015 and 1925 cm~1 (after H; treatment at 573 K) accompanied by a weak band at 2120 cm\"1 as shown in Fig. 1, spectra b - d. These spectra are entirely identical to those observed earlier for similar treatment conditions [10] and attributed to mononuclear Os(CO)2 surface complexes with the Os atom in an oxidation state lower than +2. The forma- tion of these complexes was explained by an oxidative degradation of the original Os3 cluster framework by surface OH groups and formation of 300 Fig. 1. Sample B (KiCO^-OsstCO)!^).

Os^CCQz and Os^CC^ surface complexes [6 -10,12] which -devel- oped IR carbonyl bands at 2128, 2050 and 1970 cm\"1 [6,10]. Subsequent H; treatment at elevated temperatures led to reduction of these complexes. Under the present experimental conditions, oxidative cluster degradation is most probably initiated at the lower temperature, followed by reduction as temperature increases, which would lead to the broad bands and frequency shifts at intermediate temperatures as seen in Fig. 1, spectra b and c, Earlier EPR studies [19] have shown that the formation of paramag- netic species such as 0s\"1' occurs only at temperatures < 470 K and at relative concentrations less than 2%. The presence of Os\"*\" complexes can thus not explain the surface complexes observed by IR spectroscopy. We therefore infer that the formal oxidation state of the majority species is Os(0). These osmium atoms would probably bear a partial positive charge due to their coordination to surface oxygen atoms, and the aggregation to metal particles would be hindered by the protecting CO ligands. Exposure of the sample to CO at 300 K after Hz treatment at 573 K does not produce any changes in the carbonyl stretching region (compare spectra d and g in Fig. 1). Hz treatment at still higher temperature leads to a strong or even complete elimination of the CO ligands (spectra e and f, Fig. 1). Exposure to CO at 300 K of a sample after H^ treatment at 673 K 301 leads to recarbonylation and development of a strong band at 2015 cm\"1, accompanied by a weak feature at 2110 cm\"1 (compare spectra e and h, Fig. 1). We infer that the band at 2015 cm\"1 indicates the formation of small metal aggregates during the decarbonylation process which eliminates the protecting CO ligands. The CO stretching frequency for CO adsorbed on metallic osmium was reported to occur at 2030 cm\"1 [20]. K^[OsO-i(OH)^]-derived catalysts CO adsorption on unreduced precursor IR carbonyl spectra taken after thermal treatment of KatOsOatOI^]- derived sample Aa (4.2 wt.% Os) in CO atmosphere at various temperatures (77 - 673 K) are shown in Fig. 2. Spectrum a (77 K) displays a single absorp- tion at 2150 cm~1 assignable to weakly held CO species (H-bonded to sup- port OH groups [21, 22]) which disappears typically upon degassing at 77 K (spectrum b), or by increasing the temperature (spectrum e). The width and shape of this absorption may be due to the presence of an additional over- lapping absorption, normally encountered at 2145-2135 cm\"!, assignable to physisorbed CO species [21]. Apart from these unstable CO surface species, no other carbonyl bands can be detected. These results may infer that the Os sites present in the catalyst do not expose any unsaturated coordination sites to take up CO ligands. As temperature increases from 280 K to 373 K in the presence of CO, a three-band structure develops (bands at 2110, 2015 and 1930 cm\"1) which compares nicely with the spectral features shown in Fig. 1, spectrum d for 2200 2000 1900 1800 Wdvenumbers/cm Fig. 2. Sample Aa unreduced (K2[OsOi(OH)4]). IR carbonyl spectra of adsorbed CO (40 torr, 20 min) at 77 (a), 250 (c), 280 (d), 298 (e), 320 (f), 373 (g), 473 (h), 573 (i) and 673 K (j). Spectrum (b) was obtained after degassing at 77 K for 5 min. 302 the (^-cluster-derived materials, although the bands appear to be broader. This coincidence suggests that similar mononuclear surface species have formed on the K-osmate-derived catalyst during CO exposure at the low temperatures between 280 and 373 K. It must therefore be concluded that reduction of the osmium precursor by CO occurs even at these low temper- atures. At temperatures between 473 K and 673 K in the presence of CO, the spectra broaden significantly, and the most prominant features shift to lower wavenumbers, namely to 2010 and 1915 cm\"1. Although the spectra are not identical, they are nevertheless very similar to those recorded after H; reduction and CO adsorption (see Fig. 6). As TEM of those samples had shown particle aggregation (see Fig. 4), it is concluded that the spectral features observed in Fig. 2, h - j are also indicative of the presence of metal aggregates in addition to surface complexes. We therefore infer that CO reduces the osmium species to the metal at temperatures > 470 K. Hydrogen reduction Determination of the TPR behavior in a stream of Ha/He in the temper- ature range 298 - 773 K was confined to samples Aa and Ab. In addition, a physical mixture of the osmium compound between two layers of alumina was examined. A blank experiment with the support did not show any hydrogen consumption. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 3. Samples Aa and Ab exhibit similar features (spectra a, b): Reduction begins near 390 K, maxima are located at 443 K (Aa) or 433 K (Ab), and H; consumption is completed at about 650 K. A second flat maximum appears near 520 K and is associated with the formation of methane and very small amounts of ethane, propane and carbon dioxide. The methane production shows a marked maximum between 570 and 620 K, and this formation can explain quantitatively the second maximum of the hydrogen consumption. The origin of this methane production is not well understood; 570 670 770 Temperature/K \" Fig. 3.

The total amount of methane evolved corresponds to 530 ppm of carbon. On the other hand, the mixture shows a notably different reduction behavior for the free precursor (Fig. 3, c): the onset of reduction is shifted to 470 K and the H; consumption trace shows prominent maxima at 590 and 630 K, till completion is achieved at about 690 K. The comparison of these results emphasizes that the impregnation of the osmium precursor (samples Aa and Ab) facilitates its reduction as compared to its free state; this can be ascribed to the high dispersion on the support surface and to possible structural perturbations. Calculations based on the H; consumption data (Table 2) reveal that reduction of osmium in the free salt is the most pronounced, leading to an average oxidation number of +0.4. The extent of reduction of the impreg- nated salts depends on the loading. Lightly loaded sample Ab exhibits an average Os oxidation state of +2, suggesting that the final reduction product for this sample is an osmium(II) compound. This can be compared with the vacuum oxidative decomposition of supported osmium cluster, which leads to the formation of carbonyl-osmium complexes with the same oxidation number. Oxide and aquo complexes of osmium(II) are not yet known, but there are numerous examples of osmium(II) complexes with other ligands, always showing a coordination number of six. Thus the reduction step can formally be described as follows: K2[Os02(OH)4] + 2H; > 2KOH + 'OsO' + 3H20 (3) where 'OsO' indicates an Os2\"*\" surface species in basic environment. Sample Aa can be more deeply reduced with an average osmium oxida- tion state of +0.6. This suggests that an appreciable percentage of the osmium in the system has been reduced to a formal zero-valent state. Assum- ing the presence of Os2\"*\" besides the zero-valent osmium, this leads to an estimated 30% osmium species in the +2 oxidation state. The corresponding absolute number of Os atoms coincides closely with the metal loading of 304 catalyst Ab (1.6 wt.%), which turned out to be almost totally present as Os2* species. It is therefore suggested that a limited number of sites exists on the alumina support surface, on which 0s2\"1\" complexes remain stabilized during Ha reduction at up to 720 K. As shown in the following section, the Os(0) species aggregate to form metal particles. Metal aggregation A sample of the Aa catalyst was examined by TEM after H; reduction at 673 K. The observed particle size distribution is shown in Fig. 4. The figure clearly shows that metal aggregation occurred after this treatment, the metal particle sizes ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 nm with an average particle diam- eter of 1.8 nm. The fact that aggregation occurs in sample Aa, whereas it could not be detected with the cluster-derived materials (see above and [10]), is most probably due to the significantly higher metal loading of sample Aa (4.2 wt.% Os) as compared to sample B (1.6 wt.% Os). This view is supported by the observation that also in sample Ab, containing only 1.6 wt.% metal, Os2\"1\" complexes remained stabilized (vide supra) and thus metal aggregation cannot have occurred. The particle size distribution seems to shift slightly towards larger particles after CO adsorption (130 mbar) at 573 K. CO adsorption on H^-reduced samples In situ CO adsorption on catalyst samples Aa and Ab, which were reduced in flowing Hz at 673 K for 1 h, was carried out in the temperature range 77 to 473 K. The corresponding IR carbonyl spectra are shown in Fig. 5 (sample Ab) and Fig. 6 (sample Aa). Sample Ab: CO adsorption at 77 K (Fig. 5a) shows two bands at 2150 and 2185 cm\"'. The species giving rise to the band at 2150 cm\"1 is weakly adsorbed and can be removed on evacuation (Fig. 5b). As above (Fig. 2), (a) Ib) 01 1 2 3 Particle diameter /nm Fig. 4.

IR carbonyl spectra of adsorbed CO (40 torr, 10 min) at 77 (a), 180 (c), 220 (d), 250 (e), 273 (f), 298 (g), 373 (h), 473 K (i) and after degassing at 77 K for 5 min (b). Sample background ( ). it is ascribed to H-bonded CO. The band at 2185 cm~1 is characteristic of an Al3\"*\" CO species [22] which is more firmly bound than the H-bonded species. No carbonyl bands characteristic of osmium carbonyl species can be detected at 77 K in the presence of a CO atmosphere, probably due to the strong absorption of the weakly held CO. The broad and weak feature near 2035 cm~1 seen in spectrum a of Fig. 5 was already present in the back- ground. A very weak band emerges at 2115 cm~1 at 180 K in the presence of CO. The intensities of this band and of the feature at 2035 cm\"1 increase with increasing temperature up to 300 K. At still higher temperature (473 K), a very weak broad band seems to emerge around 1940 cm\"1. The band pair at 2120 and 2035 cm\"! can clearly be ascribed to Os24\" tricarbonyl species [6], the Os2'1\" oxidation state being supported by the TPR results shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The broad band near 1940 cm\"1 may possibly be a first indication of some metal aggregation at the higher temperature, due to further reduction in CO atmosphere. It is not clear why the formation of the Os2+(CO)3 complex (band pair at 2115 and 2035 cm\"1) apparently occurred via an activated chemisorption step. It can be speculated that the Os2\"*\" complex after H; reduction is co- ordinated to oxygen atoms from the support (see eqn. (3)) and to hydroxyl 306 groups arising from the formation of potassium hydroxide. Some of these ligands may be displaced by CO as the temperature rises. Sample Aa: In contrast to sample Ab, adsorption of CO at 77 K on sample Aa produces only the band at 2150 cm\"1 (Fig. 6a) characteristic of H-bonded CO, while the Al^ CO coordination species cannot be detected. The same observation was made on the unreduced sample Aa (see Fig. 2a). The absence of the A13\"1\" coordination sites can most probably be explained by the high potassium content of this sample, which eliminates most of the Lewis acid sites. No carbonyl bands characteristic of osmium carbonyl species can be detected at low temperatures until very weak bands begin to appear at 2110 and 2035 cm\"1 at 220 K (Fig. 6d), which suggest the formation of a small number of Os2+(CO)3 complexes [6]. A very broad and poorly struc- tured absorption develops in the temperature range 250 - 473 K (spectra e - i. Fig. 6). The spectrum obtained after CO adsorption at 473 K exhibits overlapping bands centered around 2035 and 2000 cm\"1 and a broad shoul- der near 1920 cm\"1 (spectrum i in Fig. 6). TEM indicated the formation of metal aggregates (Fig. 4) which did not disappear on exposure to CO, and TPR consistently demonstrated reduction of a large fraction of the osmium to the zero-valent state (Table 2). It is therefore tempting to assign the observed spectra as being characteristic for CO adsorbed on metal aggregates of a relatively broad size distribution, with some contributions from Os2\"*\" carbonyl complexes. Again, it appears that CO adsorption occurs via an activated step. The reason for this phenomenon remains, again, unclear. It may be related as discussed above for sample Ab to a blocking effect of the metal sites by species related to potassium (hydroxide, oxide). Alternatively, one might also speculate that C- and 0-bonded carbonyl of the type Os C=0-^K may contribute to the broad shoulder near 1920 cm~1 (compare contact ion pairs [23]). Hydrogenocarbonate, carbonate and formate species In addition to the carbonyl species, the formation of hydrogenocar- bonate (bicarbonate) HCOa\", carbonate COa2\" and formate HCOa\" was observed during CO adsorption on the different catalyst samples, which were previously reduced in a stream of H; at 673 K for 1 h. The results are dis- played in Table 3, together with some literature data. The assignment of the observed bands is straightforward [24] and corresponds to the formation of formate and bicarbonate surface species. It should be noted that the band positions show little variation for the different catalysts, indicating clearly that the same surface species were formed, even in the case of the pure alumina support. This supports the view that the osmium or the potassium atoms exhibit only a weak influence on these IR spectra, indicating that the species are probably coordinated to the support surface. 307 TABLE 3 IR bands of bicarbonate and formate surface species observed during CO adsorption Sample v(CH) f(CO) asym 6(OCH) v(CO) sym v{CO) asym v(CO) sym 5(COH) Ref.

Formation of bicarbonate and formate As a typical example, IR spectra of sample B ((^(CO^-KzCOa cata- lyst) are presented in Fig. 7. In the presence of CO at room temperature, three strong bands appear at 1660, 1435 and 1230 cm\"1 (spectrum b), which correspond to the formation of bicarbonate species. As the adsorption Wavenumber / cm\"1 Fig. 7. Sample B (^003-083(00)12). IR spectra in the 1700 1100 cm~1 region after treatment in a H^ stream (673 K, 1 h) followed by evacuation (a) and after CO adsorp- tion (100 torr) at 298 (b) and 573 K (c). 308 temperature increases to 473 K, these bands grow and then decrease slowly at still higher temperature, when new bands characteristic of formate species simultaneously emerge at 1595, 1393 and 1382 cm~1 (spectrum c) together with two weak bands at 2910 and 2975 cm\"1. These bands have maximum intensity at 573 K. The bicarbonate species are weakly bonded to the surface and disappear readily on evacuation or by temperature increase above 473 K. In contrast, the formate species are resistant to vacuum. Bicarbonate formation on Hz-reduced sample B was shown by low- temperature measurements to begin already at 200 K. A possible explana- tion for this low-temperature formation could be a redox reaction with 0s2'1\" species still existing on the surface of the alumina. As the temperature in- creases, HC03\"\" formation may be more probably due to CO disproportiona- tion or to water-gas shift reaction with surface hydroxyl groups. The pos- sible participation of osmium as catalyst for these reactions may be ex- plained by the observation that the oxidation state of the osmium surface species easily switches between Os(0) and Os^ [10]. Formate species may be involved as intermediates in catalytic reactions such as the water-gas shift reaction [26, 27], and from the preceding results it is possible to discuss the conditions of formation of such species on the catalyst surface. The formation of formate follows the development of bi- carbonate species at temperatures higher than 473 K in a CO or CO + H; atmosphere. These two surface species give almost identical IR bands on all samples (Table 3) and it seems thus reasonable to assume that these species are coordinated preferentially to cus Al3\"*\" rather than to K\"*\" cations. In the case of formate species, the mean wavenumber separation of 217 cm\"1 between the antisymmetric and symmetric COO\" stretching modes is typical for a bridging coordination of the anion [30]. Also, on comparison with published data [25], the values of the symmetric stretching vibration agree better with an Al3'1\" coordination (1385 -1375 cm~1) than with a K\"1\" co- ordination (1350 cm~1). For the bicarbonate species, their ease of removal from the surface suggests that they are not very firmly bound and display more probably a monodentate coordination, although a bidentate coordina- tion cannot be excluded. The formation of bicarbonate species results from the interaction of gaseous COy. with a surface hydroxyl group, and can be simply described as an acid-base reaction [31]. On the other hand, the formation of formate anions from bicarbonate would correspond to a reduction and may be represented by the following equation: 9 y HC/V\"2 or c0 ~^ (A) +H20 or ^ ^s AlJtis^s Formation of carbonate In the case of the highly loaded sample Aa reduced under the same conditions, CO adsorption shows, in addition to the bands of HCOg\" and 309 HCO;\", two broad absorptions at 1590 and 1340 cm~1. These bands in- crease with temperature and are resistant to evacuation; they can be attrib- uted to bridging carbonate species [24 - 26] and their formation can be explained by the high content of potassium of sample Aa (1.74 wt.%), as compared to samples Ab (0.68 wt.%) and B (0.5 wt.%) which gave only bicarbonate bands. The formation of carbonate species involves two basic centers, probably associated with potassium cations, leading to a bridged coordination mode. For such structures, the maximum possible distance between two potassium cations bonded to the same carbonate anion can be estimated to be about 0.64 nm, from geometrical considerations*. This value is in fair agreement with the mean K'^-K'1' distance estimated for perfectly dispersed potassium cations on catalyst Aa (0.72 nm), whereas the corresponding K^K\"*\" distance in catalyst Ab would be approximately 1.12 nm. IR measurements of direct CO; adsorption on these catalysts are in agreement with the proposed surface chemistry. Conclusions The comparison of 7-Al203-supported catalysts prepared from osmium precursors has shown that the same species are formed in a reducing atmo- sphere, but in different temperature ranges depending on the precursor used. This species corresponds to an osmium carbonyl complex Os(CO)2 with a formal oxidation number of zero and characterized by two carbonyl stretch- ing vibrations at 2015 and 1925 cm\"1. In the case of the Os^CO)^ cluster- derived catalyst, thermal treatment in a H; atmosphere induces first an oxidative degradation of the metal framework, leading to the formation of isolated surface Os^CO); and Os^CC^a complexes, followed by reduction to Os(CO)2 as the temperature increases. Complete decarbonylation is ob- tained at 673 K, which then leads to metal aggregation. For the potassium osmate K2[Os02(OH)4]-derived samples, CO treatment leads to the forma- tion of Os(CO)2 even at low temperature, and osmium metal aggregates are formed when the temperature rises above 473 K. The influence of the osmium loading was demonstrated for K.^OsO'i- (OH)4]-derived catalysts by the extent of Ha reduction. When the loading is low (1.6 wt.%), 0s2'1\" species are highly stabilized after Hz-reducing treat- ment; further reduction to Os(0) can occur only in a CO atmosphere. For catalysts having higher loading (4.2 wt.%), after Ha-reduction metal aggre- gates form, with a mean diameter of 1.8 nm and a rather broad particle size distribution. This agrees with the view that the alumina support presents a limited number of sites which are able to stabilize 0s2\"1' species during H;- reduction. *The potassium cations can move on the bases of two cones whose tops are the oxygen atoms and whose axes correspond to the C 0 bond length. The values used are: d(C-O) = 0.13 nm; dtO-'-K-\"-) = 0.27 nm; C 0---K angle: 110 . 310 The presence of potassium cations on the surface did not show any appreciable effect in the case of the cluster-derived catalysts. When the potassium osmate was used as precursor, a possible influence was displayed by a blocking effect for CO-adsorption at low temperature on osmium species or metal aggregation sites; this is supported by an activated chemi- sorption step for the adsorption of CO on osmium species at temperatures below 300 K. The formation of surface carbonate also depends markedly on the potassium content, and can be seen only on catalysts having high potassium loading (1.7 wt.%). In this case, low temperature CO-adsorption did not detect any accessible cus A13\"'\" sites on the surface. Bicarbonate and formate anions are formed successively during CO adsorption on all the catalysts. The vibration frequencies of these species do not depend on the presence of potassium, and are characteristic of a bridged coordination mode in the case of the formate species. These latter species may be considered as intermediates in the water-gas shift reaction. Their reactivity has been also studied and will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

Al2O3-supported osmium catalysts were prepared from Os3(CO)12 and from K2[OsO2(OH)4]. The cluster-derived catalyst was modified with potassium by an additional impregnation with K2CO3. The materials were physically characterized by carbonyl infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction and transmission electron microscopy. Isolated surface complexes were the majority species in the Os3-derived catalysts, their oxidation state being +2 after thermal treatment while Os(0) carbonyl species were formed after H2 reduction. These did not aggregate to metal particles due to the presence of the protecting CO ligands. Catalysts prepared from the potassium osmate compound behaved differently for different loadings. At low loading (1.6 wt.% Os) Os2+ species were highly stabilized even after reducing treatments. CO turned out to be a more efficient reducing agent than H2. In contrast, at high loading (4.2 wt.% Os) metal aggregation was observed after H2 reduction, with average metal particle diameters of 1.8 nm. The major effect of potassium in these materials seemed to be blocking of the osmium species for CO adsorption at low temperatures (⩽300K). The formation of bicarbonate, carbonate and formate species was also detected during the adsorption of CO. These species may be involved as intermediates in catalytic reactions such as water-gas shift. Possible formation routes of these species and the role of potassium are discussed. References 1 Yu.I.
