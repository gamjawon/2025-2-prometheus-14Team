Pardhasaradhi** and A. Satyanarayana Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500 007 (India) (Received September 28, 1990; accepted January 24, 1991) Abstract Vapour phase reaction of CH30NO and CO resulted in the reduction of liganded NO to NH3 in the presence of water vapour over [RhCl2(CO)Z1-/C catalyst. Nitric oxide with or without moisture is not reduced by CO under similar conditions. Intramolecular sshydride shifts from OCH3 and hydrides from water (WGSR) are thought to reduce NO to NH3. Introduction Studies on the gas phase reactions of metal ions with organic molecules have provided fundamental information on the intrinsic reactivity of the metal ions in the absence of complicating solvent effects. The reactions of naked transition metal ions with alkyl nitrites and nitroalkanes have been studied by Cassady et al. [1, 2]. The reaction of methylnitrite is dominated by insertion of the metal ion into the weak CH30-NO bond (42 kcal mol-') [3] followed by retention of one of the moieties with the metal ion. It has been shown that Rh+ ion not only retains the NO moiety, but also acts as a dehydrogenating agent for CH20, which is obtainable from the methoxide moiety. In the present study, we have investigated the vapour phase reaction of CH30NO and CO over [RhC12(CO)21 -/C catalyst, and achieved the reduction of liganded NO into NH3 via intramolecular ss-hydride shift in the presence of water co-catalysis. Experimental Carbon monoxide (99.2io) was used from the cylinder. Nitric oxide was prepared by metering aqueous H2S04 into NaNOz solution, and the gas purified by bubbling through aqueous KOH solution [4]. Methyl nitrite was prepared by slow addition of aqueous HZS04 to a mixture of MeOH (60 ml), H20 (60 ml) and NaN02 (50 g) taken in a RB flask [5]. Continuous production *IICT Communication No. 2512. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/$3.50 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 360 of methyl nitrite was ensured by gentle stirring of the reaction mixture while aqueous HZSOq (10 N) was metered into it. Methyl nitrite was passed through a condenser at 0-5 C, and CaC12 drying tubes to remove water. The flow rate of gas was checked with the help of a soap bubble meter. The reaction was carried out in continuous manner by passing a mixture of methyl nitrite and CO through the tubular glass reactor containing [RhC12(CO)21-/C catalyst (precatalyst RhC13/C (0.6 g RhC13 - 3H20 deposited on 4.57 g active carbon) taken in the reactor and heated at 180 C for 3 h in a stream of CO) [6]. The reactor is jacketted with an oil bath and electrically heated to the desired temperature. The product gases were identified by MS/GC. Ammonia was estimated by absorbing it into a standard H2SOq solution and titrating the unreacted acid against standard NaOH. In order to minimise any destruction of NH3 by nitrogen oxides in the presence of 02, the determinations were carried out in NZ atmosphere.

NO, when a mixture of anhydrous methyl nitrite and CO was passed through it at 200 C. The product gases are acidic and turned to brown oxides of nitrogen on contact with air [8]. In contrast, the same reaction in the presence of moisture (water vapour) led to the continuous formation of NH3 in addition to C02, N20, NZ and NO. In order to confirm the identity of the basic compound, the product gases were bubbled at 5 C through anhydrous ether which was saturated with dry HCI. The precipitated white solid was filtered and crystallised from aqueous MeOH. Its identity as NH4Cl was established by IR and qualitative analysis. The variation in the yield of NH3 as estimated by the titration method, with the change in the feed moles of CO and H20, 362 is given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Figure 1 represents the yield of NH3 with respect to time factor W/F (g catalyst per moles H20 + CO + CH30NO per hour). Nitric oxide is not reduced to NH3 in the presence or absence of moisture when a mixture of NO and CO is passed over the catalyst under similar conditions. The product gases contained unreacted NO. Therefore, it can be concluded that NH3 formation takes place only when methyl nitrite is reacted with CO in the presence of HZO. The involvement of the three hydrogens of OCH3 in the reduction is indicated by the complete absence of NH3 formation in the reaction of ethyl nitrite under similar conditions. While there is no reduction of NO to NH3, a copious generation of acetaldehyde has been observed together with N20 [ 9 ]. The intramolecular transfer of three hydrogens of OCH3 is further indicated by the absence of formaldehyde in the products of methyl nitrite reaction. The co-catalysis of H20 in this reaction is deduced from the recovery of equal amounts of HZO after condensation of the products. Based on these findings, it can be suggested that the reduction of NO takes place through the initial oxidative addition of methyl nitrite to the rhodium catalyst followed by intramolecular 3-hydride shift from OCH3, and the hydride from H20 through the water-gas shift reaction (Scheme 1). The presence of N20 and NZ in the product gases may be accounted for by the thermalysis of methyl nitrite and also by the reaction of NH3 with NO [ 10 ]. Alkyl nitrites and CO are reported to react over supported metal catalysts, viz. Pt, Pd or Rh on active carbon, to give dialkyl oxalates and NO [ 11 ]. Acknowledgement We thank Dr. A. V.
