Tel: +61-7-31386630 Corresponding author Tel: +61-7-31386630 High active and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are essential components of renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and metal/air batteries. Herein, we propose that ORR active Cu/graphitic carbon nitride (Cu/g-CN) electrocatalyst can be prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction in the present of the ionic liquid (IL) bis(1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium) tetrachlorocuprate [(C16mim)2CuCl4] and protonated g-CN. The as-prepared Cu/g-CN showed an impressive ORR catalytic activity that a 99 mV positive shift of the onset potential and 2 times kinetic current density can be clearly observed, comparing with the pure g-CN. In addition, the Cu/g-CN revealed better stability and methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C (HiSPECTM 3000, 20%). Therefore, the proposed Cu/g-CN, as the inexpensive and efficient ORR electrocatalyst, would be a potential candidate for application in fuel cells. Graphical Abstract Cu supported on graphitic carbon nitride electrocatalyst was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction and shows high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline electrolyte. Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Graphitic carbon nitride Nanoparticle Electrocatalyst Ionic liquid The crucial oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), one of the most process in metal-air batteries and fuel cells, is kinetically sluggish and requires a high over-potential, thus similarly, appeals for a highly efficient catalyst [1–3]. Up to now, platinum(Pt)-based materials are still the most popular ORR electrocatalysts with high current density and four-electron pathway, yet suffer remarkably from the high cost, low abundance, poor stability, methanol poisoning [4]. As a result, developments of alternative non-precious ORR electrocatalysts are of great important research area [5]. Nitrogen-modified carbon materials have been extensively investigated as heteroatom-modified carbon electrocatalysts for the ORR recently, which essentially comprise nitrogen incorporated, either at the edges or within the core structure of the carbon material by substituting one of the sp 2-hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic structure [6–8]. They exhibited competitive electrocatalytic activity for ORR, thanks to doped nitrogen atom, especially the pyridinic or/and graphitic nitrogen in these carbon structure, that can boost the initial chemical adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface and also offer possible active sites for oxygen reduction [9–11]. Graphitic-phase carbon nitride (g-CN), a graphite-like carbonaceous material that is enriched with a very high nitrogen content including both pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen moieties, may act as a potential high efficient electrocalaysts for ORR. However, the g-CN with high nitrogen content has one disadvantage that the low electrical conductivity of g-CN strongly restricts the electron transport during the ORR process and also reduces its electrocatalytic activity [11–13]. Therefore, the development of high efficient ORR electrocalaysts based g-CN is still a significant challenge. Herein, we report that a non-precious Cu/g-CN with a good electrocatalytic ORR performance could be prepared from a protonated g-CN and ionic liquid (IL) bis(1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium) tetrachlorocuprate [(C16mim)2CuCl4] in a hydrothermal way. Cooperating with transition metals Cu can supply some new electrocatalytic active sites and improve the conductivity of electrocatalyst. As non-precious electrocatalyst, Cu/g-CN showed much better long-term durability and methanol tolerance that the commercial Pt/C (HiSPEC TM 3000, 20%) in an alkaline medium. The protonated g-C3N4 and (C16mim)2CuCl4 were prepared according to our previous works [14,15]. For the Cu/g-CN, (C16mim)2CuCl4 (1.3127 g) was dissolved in ethylene glycol (EG) solvent (20 mL) to form a homogeneous solution. Then, the protonated g-CN (0.0254 g) and aqueous NaOH (1.28 mL, 5 mol/L) were added into the above solution with vigorous stirring, respectively. After that the precursor was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (25 mL) and heated at 160 C for 48 h. Lastly, Cu/g-CN was obtained by washing the precipitate with water and ethanol. All the electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI700 electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, China) and rotating ring disk electrode (RDE) (RRDE-3A, Japan) in a typical three-electrode cell equipped with gas flow systems. A RDE was used as the working electrode. 20 μL of the electrocatalysts suspension in ethanol (1 mg/mL of Cu/g-CN or 0.5 mg/mL of commercial Pt/C) was drop-casted on the surface of the RDE. The electrode was allowed to dry at room temperature and heated at 60 C for 15 min. After that, 5 μL of 0.05 wt% Nafion was further drop-casted on the surface of the electrode. Finally, the electrode was again dried at room temperature and heated at 60 C for 15 min. A platinum filament and Ag/AgCl (3 mol/L KCl) were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.1 mol/L KOH in water, which was bubbled with O2 or N2 for 30 min and maintained with the same atmosphere during the measurements. To achieve more textural information of Cu/g-CN, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed (Fig. 1 (a)). It was found that both XRD patterns of g-CN and Cu/g-CN were dominated by a strong peak at 27.6, almost the same as the typical interlayer-stacking peak (002) facet, indicating that Cu/g-CN remains the layered structure of the g-CN [16]. The typical face-centered cubic copper can be observed from the XRD pattern of Cu/g-CN (JCPDS card NO. 040836, α = 0.3615 nm). No characteristic peaks of any other phases or impurities can be detected, confirming that the Cu/g-CN only contains Cu and g-CN. In the FT-IR spectrum of g-CN (Fig. 2 (b)), the peaks at 1637 and 1243 cm−1 were attributed to the C=N and C–N stretching vibration modes, respectively [16]. The peak around 808 cm−1 corresponded to the s-triazine ring mode [17]. Moreover, in the FT-IR spectrum of Cu/g-CN, all the main characteristic peaks of g-CN can be clearly observed, indicating that the structure of g-CN in the composite does not change (Fig. 2(b)). Pure g-CN showed a two-dimensional sheet-like structure (Fig. 1(c)). Some black colored dots corresponding to the Cu nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of g-CN. The average size of the Cu nanoparticles was ca. 40 nm. No agglomeration of the Cu nanoparticles on the g-CN surface may be due to that uncondensed functional groups can act as ligands to coordinate with Cu ions and then efficiently stabilize Cu nanoparticles. The catalytic activity of Cu/g-CN (20 wt%) and Pt/C towards the ORR was assessed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in an O2 versus N2-staturated KOH solution (0.1 mol/L) (Fig. 2(a)). For the N2-saturated solution, reduction peaks were negligible both for Cu/g-CN and Pt/C electrode. For the O2-saturated solution, a remarkable reduction peak was observed with onset potential of ca. −0.223 V (peak position at ca. −0.443 V) and −0.04 V (peak position at −0.158) for Pt/C. To further reveal the ORR kinetics of g-CN and Cu/g-CN, a RDE was used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). For a fair comparison, the same amount of each electrocatalyst by mass loaded on the RDE, and the geometrical area of the electrode was used to calculated the current density [18,19]. Fig. 2(b) shows the corresponding LSV curves of O2 reduction at g-CN, Pt/C, and Cu/g-CN obtained with different masses of Cu in the composites in an O2-saturated KOH solution (0.1 mol/L) at the same rotation rate (1600 r/min). In comparison with pristine g-CN, at which the oxygen reduction onset potential at around −0.213 V, all Cu/g-CN showed superior ORR electrocatalytical activity. For instance, the Cu/g-CN (20 wt%) exhibited a much more positive ORR onset potential (−0.114 V) and higher cathodic currents, demonstrating that a significant enhancement of ORR catalytic activity was achieved by the introduction of Cu species. Moreover, with the increase of Cu doping amount, the electrocatalytic activity of the Cu/g-CN ameliorated initially. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity may be contributed to the more activity sites and higher conductivity of composite with increase of the contents of Cu. However, the electrocatalytic activity of Cu/g-CN did not improve, when the mass ratio of Cu in the composite surpasses 20 wt%. This may be caused by the low content of nitrogen and poor dispersion of Cu nanoparticles, suggesting synergistic effect between Cu and g-CN is indispensable to the high ORR activity of the composite. Notably, the onset potential of Cu/g-CN (20 wt%) was more negative than that of Pt/C, but the ORR current density at −0.8 V of as-prepared Cu/g-CN was comparable with that of Pt/C. The detailed voltammograms at different rotation rates for Cu/g-CN (20 wt%) and g-CN are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (e), respectively. For the shortened diffusion layer, the measured current density (J) increased with increasing rotation rate (ω). Koutecky-Levich plots revealed good linearity between J −1 and ω −1/2, and approximately constant slopes over the potentials from −0.45 to −0.9 V were observed Fig. 2(d) and (f), respectively. The electron-transfer number (n) and kinetic current density (J k) are the two important parameters that reflect the kinetics of the ORR process; these are calculated from the slope and the reciprocal of the intercept of the Koutecky-Levich plots, respectively. According to the Koutecky-Levich equations [20,21], the calculated n value of Cu/g-CN was 4.1 at −0.7 V; this indicates the oxygen reduction primarily dominated by a four-electron pathway. In contrast, the value of n for g-CN at −0.7 V was 2.2, demonstrating that the oxygen reduction mainly followed a two-electron process with the formation of intermediate HO2– ions. Moreover, the calculated kinetic current density of Cu/g-CN (J k = 4.09 mA/cm2) was higher than that of g-CN (J k = 2.02 mA/cm2). All these results suggest that doping Cu into the g-CN endows the materials with a superior electrocatalytic activity for ORR than that of the pristine g-CN. The stability of Cu/g-CN (20 wt%) and Pt/C catalysts in an O2-saturated KOH solution (0.1 mol/L) was investigated by chronoamperometry at −0.5 V with a 1600 r/min electrode rotation rate. After 3600 seconds, the commercial Pt/C catalysts exhibited a loss of ca. 15% of the specific catalytic activity, while the Cu/g-CN maintained stable throughout the experiment with only a 1% decrease in current density (Fig. 3 (a)). In addition, Cu/g-CN had an excellent tolerance to methanol. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the addition of 3 M methanol to the O2-saturated electrolyte did not apparently affect the catalytic activity of Cu/g-CN towards ORR. The curve of Pt/C catalyst displayed a dramatic decay of relative current. This result clearly shows that Cu/g-CN selectively reduces O2, which is beneficial to avoid the occurrence of mixed potential in methanol fuel cells. In summary, we report that a high efficient electrocatalyst Cu/g-CN for ORR was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using (C16mim)2CuCl4 and protonated g-CN. Meanwhile, the Cu/g-CN exhibited an impressive ORR catalytic activity with better long-term stability and higher selectivity than commercial Pt/C catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Cooperating with Cu can significantly affect the electron transportation and active sites for oxygen reduction by electrochemical investigations. Thus, the rational combination of Cu and g-CN may offer a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for the ORR in fuel cells and other catalytic applications.

        "dc:description": "High active and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are essential components of renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and metal/air batteries. Herein, we propose that ORR active Cu/graphitic carbon nitride (Cu/g-CN) electrocatalyst can be prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction in the present of the ionic liquid (IL) bis(1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium) tetrachlorocuprate [(C16mim)2CuCl4] and protonated g-CN. The as-prepared Cu/g-CN showed an impressive ORR catalytic activity that a 99 mV positive shift of the onset potential and 2 times kinetic current density can be clearly observed, comparing with the pure g-CN. In addition, the Cu/g-CN revealed better stability and methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C (HiSPECTM 3000, 20%). Therefore, the proposed Cu/g-CN, as the inexpensive and efficient ORR electrocatalyst, would be a potential candidate for application in fuel cells.",
