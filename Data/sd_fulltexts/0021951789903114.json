The Impact of Catalytic Precursor on Particle Size and Catalytic Activity JEFFREY A. MIETH AND JAMES A. SCHWARZ' Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244 Received August 3, 1988; revised March 1, 1989 The effect of preparation method and the choice of metallic precursor on the performance of a series of Ru/Al^Oa catalysts were studied. Wet impregnation and incipient wetness were the meth- ods employed; ruthenium nitrosylnitrate and ruthenium trichloride were the reagents. In the latter case, either Ru(IIl)/Ru(IV) chlorospecies or mixtures of Ru(II) hydrazine complexes were the catalytic precursors. The series ofRu/A^Oj catalysts, with metal loadings from 0.7-5% by weight, were subjected to a battery of performance tests: CO temperature-programmed reaction, steady- state CO hydrogation, and temperature-programmed surface reaction. The methanation activity and carbon deposited during steady-state reaction varied systematically with the dispersion of Ru on the alumina. High rates of methane production were found on catalysts containing a large reservoir of carbon-containing reaction intermediates. The performance of these catalysts de- pended on the precursor used in their preparation. The effects of weight loading, method of preparation, and variations in the imprnant pH were small within a group prepared from a Common precursor. 1989 Academic Press. Inc. INTRODUCTION In his studies of methanation and higher hydrocarbon synthesis over a series of Group VIII metals supported on alumina, Vannice (7) compared the specific activities of the metals by normalizing the methane production to the available metal surface area. Of the Group VIII metals supported on alumina that were studied, ruthenium had the highest specific methanation activ- ity. Although ruthenium catalysts have not found widespread application in industry due to their expense, these catalysts have been used quite extensively in research aimed at deciphering the mechanism of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (2). The rea- sons for implementing ruthenium in cata- lytic studies are clear: high specific activity, ability to form long-chain hydrocarbons at low pressures, ease of reduction of the ' To whom all correspondence should be addressed. metal even at low loadings (3), and simpli- fied analysis because the products have vir- tually no oxygen content. In addition, bulk carbides do not form under reaction condi- tions and therefore reactions proceeding on the Ru surface can be studied in the ab- sence of accompanying bulk processes (4). Two schools of thought have developed concerning the mechanism of Fischer- Tropsch synthesis. The first, which was popular in the mid-1970s, favored the direct hydrogation of CO to form oxygenated intermediates (5-7). However, this mecha- nism fails to explain certain facts, such as why alcohols can initiate synthesis but can- not contribute to chain growth by dehydro- condensation (o'). As a result, a second school has formed from work in the early 1980s that claims hydrocarbon synthesis is initiated by the dissociation of adsorbed CO to form carbon, which is subsequently hy- drogenated (4, 9-15). The carbon formed is extremely reactive and can produce long 203 0021-9517/89 $3.00 Copyright 1989 by Academic Press, Inc.

Ekerdt and Bell (13) observed large amounts of carbon on a Ru/Si02 catalyst and noted that these deposits were hydro- genated at a rate in notable excess of steady-state synthesis rates. A number of different forms of carbon have been identi- fied (75, 16), each exhibiting quite different properties. The atomic carbon formed by the dissociation of CO not only leads to the synthesis of hydrocarbons, but also acts as a precursor for carburization of the catalyst (75). Observation of decreases in BET sur- face areas (77) and hydrogen adsorption (18) have been attributed to carbon deacti- vation of supported ruthenium catalysts. A characteristic of Group VIII metal cat- alysts is their structure sensitivity for hy- drocarbon synthesis from CO and H2. Boudart and McDonald (79) report that turnover frequencies of structure-sensitive reactions should vary appreciably with varying catalyst structure. For Ni/Al203 catalysts, particle size effects have been shown to increase with the magnitude of metal-support interactions (20). However, particle size effects are more apparent for Ru than Ni. King (3) observed a fourfold increase in the site-time yield for methana- tion and CO conversion for a 2.5% Ru/ AlzOs catalyst with a dispersion value of 23% compared to a 0.5% RU/A12 catalyst with 60% dispersion. Kellner and Bell (27) found that Fischer-Tropsch activity in- creases with increasing particle size for Ru/ A03 catalysts with dispersions less than 70% due to an increasing number of planar sites on Ru crystallites. This work provided a comprehensive analysis for the mecha- nism of CO hydrogation over Ru/Al3, yet only three catalysts were used in the study. Differences in dispersion were re- lated to sintering of the particles and the time the catalysts were on stream. In re- lated work. King (3) studied the effects of metal particle size and nature of the support on the specific activity for methane produc- tion. His work spanned a wide range of metal dispersions, yet the ruthenium crys- tallites formed were often small and thus the turnover frequencies for methane pro- duction were quite low. Other studies dis- puting the claims of Ru particle size effects (22, 23) have been rejected due to the insen- sitivity of the measuring systems em- ployed. In this, the first of two papers from our laboratory dealing with alumina-supported ruthenium catalysts, a number of catalysts with a wide range of dispersions were stud- ied. These catalysts were prepared using different precursors; impregnation condi- tions were also systematically varied. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the particle size distribution and, hence, performance of this catalyst system can be conveniently manipulated by proper choice of catalytic precursor. In accom- plishing this objective it was found that al- though many of the RU/A12 catalysts studied had dispersions that fell within the range of King's data, there is a group of poorly dispersed catalysts whose turnover frequencies are much larger than those measured by King. This is due to the fact that the ruthenium particles formed on the surface are large, which is a direct conse- quence of the preparation conditions. The overall objective of this research is based on determining the effects of the formula- tion procedures during catalyst preparation on the properties of RU/A12 catalysts. EXPERIMENTAL Wet impregnation and incipient wetness were the methods employed in preparing the catalysts used in this study. Ruthenium nitrosylnitrate (lot no. 03911701) and ruthe- nium trichloride (lot. no. 03706201) sup- plied by Johnson Matthey were the re- agents. Both compounds were designated analytical grade; no assay was available from the supplier. In the latter case, either Ru(III)/Ru(IV) chloro-species or mixtures of Ru(II) hydrazine complexes were the catalytic precursors. The presence of resid- ual chloride is a possible concern when try- ing to relate the effect of preparation to the PREPARATION OF Ru/ALO, CATALYSTS, I 205 performance of the finished catalyst. It was found that these effects do exist but the per- formance of the catalyst is more strongly dependent on the choice of precursor. The effects of chloride on the properties and performance of Ru/AlzOa catalysts will be discussed in Part II of this series (24). The data reported herein were obtained from catalysts in which no attempt was made to remove the chloride residues. CATALYST PREPARATION The support material used throughout this work is a i^-in. extrudate y-alumina (American Cyanamid, lot 85-NA-1402) ground to 40-80 mesh. Before use, it was calcined in a 5 cn^/min flow of air at 773 K for 3 h. RuNO(NO^lAhO A number of precautions are necessary when preparing solutions of ruthenium ni- trosylnitrate. Freshly prepared solutions of RuNO(N03)3 undergo a sequence of reac- tions at room temperature (25) that involve (i) the formation of cationic species, (ii) changes in color and spectrophotometric absorption of the solution, and (iii) the re- lease of t^ and N0^. In addition, air and light must be excluded (26) to avoid slow oxidation to Ru(IV) polymer. Therefore, all solutions of RuNO(N03)3 were prepared in Teflon beakers at room temperature, in the dark, under a nitrogen atmosphere, and al- lowed to age for 24 h with the same condi- tions prevailing (26) to ensure equilibrium. Wet impregnation. A number of impreg- nation solutions containing ruthenium ni- trosylnitrate dissolved in air-saturated dis- tilled water (pH = 6.06) were prepared. The concentration of ruthenium in these solu- tions was such that the loadings of metal on the catalysts were 0.73%, 1.7%, 3.3%, and 4.2% by weight of ruthenium on the alu- mina. The pH values of the aged solutions prior to alumina addition were 1.85, 1.39, 0.67, and 0.58, respectively. Measurements were made using a Fisher Accumet temper- ature-compensated pH meter (Model 805MP) calibrated by standard buffers (Fisher SO-B-140 and SO-B-108) at pH val- ues 1 and 7. To study pH effects within a particular group, an extra three solutions of the low-weight-loading sample were pre- pared at the same time as the 0.73% cata- lyst. The pH of these solutions was ad- justed using base [NH4 (2.5M)] and the values were 2.16, 2.83, and 3.55. The ruthenium concentration in solution before and after contact with the support was determined by a Perkin-Elmer Model 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer, utilizing an air/acetylene flame. The AA was calibrated with a ruthenium reference solution (Johnson-Matthey, lot no. 6-052 G) diluted to 20 ppm that contained 10% by volume HC1 and 1000 mg/liter La (Lan- thanum oxide from Morton Thiokol, lot no. F01G). One milliliter of each impregnating solution was removed using a fresh Corning pyrex disposable serological pipet (1 +/- 0.005 ml), and diluted within the calibration limits of the AA in 10% HC1 and 1000 mg/ liter La. The remaining 24 ml of each im- pregnating solution was added to 2 g of alu- mina and the beaker covered tightly with Parafilm. The samples were then removed from the nitrogen atmosphere (still in the dark) and placed on a wrist-action shaker for l h. After contact, the solutions were carefully filtered and the catalysts were dried at room temperature. One milliliter of the solution contacted with alumina was di- luted in 10% HC1 and 1000 mg/liter La as described above, while the pH of the re- maining solution was recorded. The diluted Ru species before and after alumina addi- tion were run sequentially in the AA, with the average of five readings taken as the ruthenium concentration dissolved. The in- strument was recalibrated with the stan- dard between sample readings. The weight loadings as determined by the above procedure compared well with the intended weight loadings based on the pore- filling volume for the 1.7%, 3.0%, and 5.0% samples. However, there was some uncer- 206 MIETH AND SCHWARZ tainty in the results for the low-weight-load- ing samples, and a technique similar to that developed by Ko et al. (27) was used to determine the Ru weight loadings. Equal amounts of catalyst were added separately to known amounts of a HC1/H2S04 mixture and heated until the sample completely dis- solved. The Ru content was determined us- ing the AA; measurements were automati- cally background-corrected (25) due to the high acid concentration. Incipient wetness. Three groups of ruthe- nium catalysts were prepared with weight loadings of 0.76%, 3.1%, and 5.0% by con- tacting 2 g of A12 with 5 ml of aged RuNO(NO3 solution in a Teflon beaker. To study pH effects, a series of five cata- lysts of intermediate weight loading (1.1%) were prepared from the same mother solu- tion. NtLtOH was added to four of the sam- ples in order to have approximately the same initial pH values as studied for the wet impregnation case. A sample contain- ing no added base was also included in this group. The initial pH values for the 1.1% samples were 1.56, 1.85, 2.38, 2.92, and 3.50. After the initial addition of support to the electrolyte, the sample was stirred under the nitrogen atmosphere for approximately 30 min. The sample was then removed and constantly shaken (in the dark). The drying time at room temperature was no more than 24 h for each sample. As a check, the dissolution method for determining weight loadings was applied to the low and high initial pH samples of the 1.1% batch. The weight loading obtained by this technique was 1.2% for each sample. This is in agreement with the intended load- ing. RuCh/AW Three groups of catalysts derived from RuCl3 were prepared with weight loadings of 0.76%, 3.0%, and 5.1% via the incipient wetness technique. The appropriate amounts of RuC^ were weighed under a ni- trogen atmosphere in order to avoid wetting of the powder. Twice the amount of re- quired metal was dissolved in 10 ml of air- saturated distilled water (pH = 5.59). The initial pH values were 1.55, 1.15, and 1.09 for the low, intermediate, and high weight- loading samples, respectively. Five ml of this RuCl3 solution was removed and con- tacted with 2.5 g of alumina in a Teflon beaker. This suspension was kept under a constant flow of nitrogen for 10 h with occa- sional shaking. After this point, the sample was removed and allowed to dry at room temperature on a wrist-action shaker. Of the remaining RuCl? solution, 1 ml was re- moved, diluted properly, and analyzed for total ruthenium concentration using the AA. This was done in order to check that the intended weight loadings were in agree- ment with the calculated values. Ru(II)/AhO Three groups of catalysts in the (2+) oxi- dation state were prepared from the wet chemical reduction of RuCl3 in hydrazine (29) via the incipient wetness technique. The weight loadings of the samples were 0.78%, 2.9%, and 4.7% with pH values of 9.96, 9.33, and 9.04 before the addition of support. As for the case of RuCl3/Al203, twice the required amount of RuCl3 was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere and dissolved in 10 ml of air-saturated distilled water. The beakers were then removed and placed in a fume hood prior to the addition of the reducing agent. A 2 ml aliquot of hy- drazine hydrate was slowly added to each solution (30) with shaking. The initial reac- tion was vigorous as N2, Hz, and NH3 gases were evolved (31). After about 15 min, the bubbling subsided and 6 ml of the solution was added to 2.5 g of alumina in a Teflon beaker. The [(RuC^^NlW/A^] sam- ples were constantly shaken and dried at room temperature. The drying time for each sample was no more than 24 h. A 1 ml aliquot of the remaining Ru(II) mother solu- tion was removed, properly diluted, and an- alyzed for its total ruthenium concentration using the AA. PREPARATION OF Ru/ALO, CATALYSTS, I 207 CATALYST CHARACTERIZATION Techniques Each of the catalysts was subjected to the following characterization techniques: (1) temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) of CO (32), (2) steady-state CO hy- drogation kinetics (/, 22), and (3) temper- ature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) (33). The CO-TPR experiment provides structural information related to the acces- sibility of the surface ruthenium sites for CO adsorption. The steady-state CO hydro- gation reaction demonstrates the differ- ences in performance for various catalysts while the TPSR experiment was conducted after the steady-state experiment to assess the amount of carbon-containing residues left on the catalyst surface. Apparatus The catalyst characterization experi- ments were carried out in a TPD apparatus. This apparatus consists of a gas-purifica- tion/flow-control section, a reactor unit, and a detector unit. The catalyst particles were contained in a stainless-steel tubular insert of the following dimensions: 20 mm long, 7.14 mm o.d., and 5.95 mm i.d. This insert had a 400-mesh stainless-steel wire cloth at the bottom to support the particles. The insert rested in a stainless-steel tube surrounded by a copper shell cooled by wa- ter circulation. The system was heated by a Micricon 823 microprocessor-controlled in- frared oven, with the temperature mea- sured at the center of the bed (34). The composition of the gas exiting from the bed was constantly monitored and recorded by an on-line UTI-100C quadrupole mass spectrometer with a computer data acquisi- tion system. Procedures To satisfy differential conditions and en- sure no mass transfer limitations, 100 mg of each catalyst was used for all the studies (35). The samples were reduced according to the procedures given by King (3). To sat- urate the catalyst surface, 40 pulses of car- bon monoxide (0.25 crr^/pulse) were in- jected into a helium flow whose flow rate was 10 cm3 / min. The formation of volatile ruthenium carbonyls under such low CO pressures is negligible (36). The system was flushed with helium for 10 min at 30 cmV min followed by a 10 min flush in 30 cmV mm of hydrogen. A TPR experiment was then performed at a 20 K/min heating rate to 773 K in a 30 cmVmin flow of hydrogen. The peaks corresponding to m/e = 2, 15, 28, and 44 were monitored throughout the course of the experiment. After a 1 h hold time, the system was flushed with helium at 773 K for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature. For a number of catalysts se- lected at random, a second TPR was per- formed. For every case, no methane or car- bon monoxide was detected. Steady-state carbon monoxide hydrog nation experiments were determined over the temperature range from 443 K to 573 K for all of the catalysts, except for the 0.76% RuNO(NO_-i)3/Al203 catalyst prepared by wet impregnation. For this sample, it was necessary to increase the temperatures to lie between 513 K and 633 K in order to get a reliable methane signal from the mass spectrometer. A 3 : 1 Hz/CO mixture with a flow rate of 30 cnrYmin was used. The tem- perature was increased by 4 K/min in steps of 20 K without intermediate reduction of the catalyst, and held at each temperature for 20 min. The peaks at m/e = 2, 15, 28, 30, and 42 were recorded. After the last measurement for the steady-state reaction was made, the cata- lyst was flushed with helium at the maxi- mum temperature for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature. A TPSR experiment was then performed using a hydrogen flow rate of 30 cnWmin and a heating rate of 20 K/min to 773 K in order to determine the amount of carbon-containing residues present on the surface of the catalyst subse- quent to the steady-state experiment. The peaks corresponding to m/e = 2, 15, 28, 30, and 42 were continuously monitored during 208 MIETH AND SCHWARZ the TPSR experiments. The system was held at 773 K for l h to remove all of the carbon deposits. As with the CO-TPR ex- periments, a random number of catalysts were subjected to a second TPSR, and for every case, no methane signal was ob- served. The surface of the catalysts after the steady-state experiments contained varying amounts of carbon. To ensure that we were not imparting any additional complexity to the catalyst surface by cooling in helium, four catalysts were selected at random and subjected to the same experiments as be- fore. However, the only difference was that the catalyst was cooled to room tempera- ture in the H2/CO mixture after the steady- state experiment. It was found that cooling the catalyst under Hz/CO flow after the steady-state experiment led to the same spectrum and amount of carbon-containing residues as those derived from cooling in helium except for the appearance of a sharp peak attributed to CO methanation because the peak appeared at the same temperature as the peak from the CO-TPR experiment. In the discussions to follow, the results un- der the TPSR experiments reflect those ob- tained after the sample was cooled under a flow of helium after steady-state CO hydro- gation. RESULTS CATALYST CHARACTERIZATION CO-TPR Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) of CO resulted in a single peak for all of the catalysts studied. A slight shoulder on the high-temperature side of the peak was ob- served in a few cases, primarily for the RuCh and Ru(II) catalysts supported on alumina. Figures la-lc show the TPR spec- tra for a series of Ru(II)/Al203 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness.

CO chemisorption has been used quite fre- quently to determine the dispersion of supported ruthenium catalysts (1, 38-41); however, its implementation has been complicated by interference from CO ad- sorption on the support and by several CO molecules bonding to a single Ru atom. To avoid these complications, subatmospheric quantities of CO were pulsed onto the cata- lyst in a helium flow. A previous study (35) has demonstrated that CO adsorption on the support is negligible under these condi- tions. To check that residual chloride PREPARATION OF Ru/AbO, CATALYSTS, I 209 present on the catalysts derived from RuCl3 was not enhancing CO adsorption on the alumina, a 0.17% CI-AI^O} sample was pre- pared by incipient wetness impregnation of the Alz03 by HC1. The sample was dried at 473 K for 3 h and calcined at 773 K in an air flow for 3 h to fix the Cl onto the support. The Cl~ concentration was confirmed by XRF. The sample was reduced (in the same manner as the other samples in this study) and subjected to a CO-TPR. No methane peak was observed, thereby demonstrating that CO adsorption on pure and chlorinated alumina is negligible for the catalysts in this study. Table 1 lists the dispersions for different catalysts from CO uptake data based on an adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Ru = 1 (42, 43). Note that for RuNO(N03)3/Al203 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness and wet impregnation the effects of metal load- ing and pH on the dispersion are negligible. Similarly, the effects of metal loading on the dispersion were insignificant for the RUC13/A12 catalysts. However, the dis- persion was greatly affected by the ruthe- nium weight loading for the ruthenium cata- lysts in the (2+) oxidation state. Hydrogen chemisorption is the technique used most often to determine metal disper- TABLE1 Summary of CO-TPR, Steady-State CO Hydrogation, and TPSR Experiments Ru wt% PH Dispersion TOF at 523 K (10-3 s-') Act. energy (kJ/mol) C/Ru Total carbon (^imol/g catal.)

To check that CO-TPR is an accurate method for determining metal dispersions in this system, the dispersion values of a test cata- lyst were determined using both Hz chemi- sorption and CO-TPR. The test sample was a 3.55% Ru/Al3 catalyst prepared from ruthenium trichloride by the incipient wet- ness technique at the Exxon Research and Engineering Co. A dispersion of 14% was measured at Exxon for this sample using Hz chemisorption (44). The catalyst was re- duced in our laboratory under the same conditions employed for the other samples in this study, and a dispersion of 14.0% was measured via CO-TPR. From these results, it is evident that CO-TPR is a reliable method for determining metal dispersions on these supported catalysts. Steady-State CO Hydrogation In this study, the majority of the product from the hydrogation of CO was meth- ane. Activities are given in terms of turn- over frequency (TOF); CO uptake was used to calculate the total number of active sites by assuming an adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Ru = 1. Except for the 0.76% RuNO(N03)3 cata- lyst prepared by the incipient wetness tech- nique, all of the catalysts were subjected to the same steady-state temperature cycle. In general, the more active catalysts had a lower range of temperatures over which a linear Arrhenius plot was found. Above this temperature range, a \"bend over\" (change in the slope of the Arrhenius plot) was ob- served due to heat and mass transfer effects in the bed. Table 1 also summarizes for each catalyst the activities for methane for- mation at 523 K and their apparent activa- tion energies. The variation in the TOF for these catalysts appears to depend on the precursor used in its preparation. Other factors such as weight loading preparation method, and pH of imprnant contribute only relatively small variations. The activa- tion energy was obtained for each catalyst in the linear range of the Arrhenius plot; reproducibility was better than kJ/mol. TPSR The carbon inventory is known to be ex- tremely complex for Ru/Alz03 catalysts (18, 33). As many as three forms of surface carbon have been observed (33) including a weakly adsorbed CO species, a relatively tightly sorbed amorphous carbon, and an unreactive graphitic carbon. The surface carbon species produced by the dissocia- tion of CO serve not only as intermediates in methanation reactions (4, 9-15), but also as precursors to site-blocking poisons (2, 17, 18). In addition, the TPSR spectra pro- vide an indication of the contribution of ad- sorbed CO to the total carbon inventory. These observations provide information about the structure of the catalyst, and can also be used to assess the impact of residual chloride on the catalysts derived from RuCLi (24). Figures 2a-2c show the TPSR spectra for Ru(II)/Al203 catalysts. The fact that previous studies have indi- cated that the carbon-containing residues may serve as reaction intermediates in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis has led to the hypothesis that catalyst activity is directly related to the amount of residue present (79). The CO uptake was used to calculate the total number of carbon-containing resi- dues per metal site (C/Ru). The results of this calculation are also given in Table 1. Note that for each ruthenium precursor, ex- cept the Ru(II) catalysts, the number of car- bon-containing residues per metal site de- creases with increasing activity. On the other hand, the number of carbon-contain- ing residues per metal site increases with increasing activity for the Ru(II)/Al203 cat- alysts. DISCUSSION A number of previous publications have addressed the issue of dispersion effects on the performance of supported ruthenium catalysts. Dalla Betta et al. (23) observed that the methanation activity of alumina- PREPARATION OF Ru/Al.O, CATALYSTS, I 211 400 600 800 000 1200 20 16 (b) 714K - 690K n 739K 400 600 800 1000 1200 20 16 (cl 7MK 400 600 800 000 TEMPERATURE(K) 1200 FIG. 2. TPSR spectra for RuTO/Al^Oa catalysts at (a) 0.78%; (b) 2.9%; and (c) 4.7%. supported ruthenium catalysts decreases with increasing dispersion. Similarly, King (3) observed a monotonie decrease in meth- anation activity with increasing dispersion for ruthenium on a variety of oxide sup- ports and zeolites. Changes in dispersion have also been observed as a result of cata- lyst sintering under reaction conditions (7, 27). Kellner and Bell (27) have suggested that for Ru dispersions below 75%, the de- crease in the specific activity for the syn- thesis of methane with increasing disper- sion is due to a decrease in the fraction of sites present on planar surfaces. While these and related studies are significant in that they disclose the various means by which one can achieve changes in disper- sion ofRu on alumina-supported catalysts, they cannot be considered exhaustive as they do not address the issue of ruthenium precursor variations on the dispersion of fresh Ru/AlzOs catalysts. A study by Bossi et al. (45) demonstrated the effects of ru- thenium precursor on the dispersion for six different ruthenium salts of equal weight loading supported on alumina. However, they did not subject their catalysts to any performance tests and thus the effects of ruthenium precursor on the dispersion and activity of alumina-supported catalysts have yet to be established. Figure 3 shows the methanation activity at 523 K as a function of Ru dispersion. Included in this plot are data from King (3), Dalla Betta et al. (23), and Vannice (7). King's work is the most comprehensive in terms of spanning a wide range of Ru dis- 20 30 40 50 % DISPERSION FIG. 3. TOF at 523 K as a function ofRu dispersion. Ref. (3); Ref. (7); Refs.

The experimental data are in agreement with the results of previous in- vestigators, as a monotonie decrease in ac- tivity with increasing dispersion is ob- served. The turnover frequencies reported here approach 500 x 10~3 s~' and thus ex- pand the range of methanation activities studied previously. In Fig. 3 none of the supported Ru cata- lysts prepared by King had a dispersion be- low 8.5%. To obtain information at lower dispersions, he used Vannice's RU/A^O} results in conjunction with the data from an unsupported Ru catalyst. By incorporating these final two samples, King's work spanned a range of dispersions from 0.3 to 60%, and the dashed line in Fig. 3 repre- sents a summary of his conclusions. How- ever, King's interpretation is misleading in that the anomalous behavior exhibited by unsupported Ru catalysts (3) excludes them from comparison with supported materi- als. We conclude from Fig. 3 that dramatic changes in the particle size distribution and hence, TOF, can be realized by altering the salt used during the preparation of Ru/ A12 catalysts. These changes in the size of Ru crystallites deposited on the alumina surface may be related to differences in the aqueous phase chemistry of the reagents studied. For example, the speciation of RuCl3 impregnating solutions is very com- plex due to the multicomponent and hetero- geneous nature of this reagent (48, 53). Polymeric ions form in RuCl3 solutions due to the presence of Ru(IV) (53). Recall that the Ru(II) solutions were prepared via the aqueous reduction of RuCl3 in hydrazine to [Ru(NH3)5N2]2+. Ru(II) complexes (formed during the initial contact of RuCl3 with hy- drazine) are larger than their parent RuCl3 species (31). With respect to solutions of RuNO(N03)3, carefully controlled prepara- tion conditions (26) lead to a series of mononuclear complexes that are com- pletely hydrolyzed at a pH greater than 2. The above data provide a rational frame- work for the hypothesis that the variation in particle size distribution of supported-Ru catalysts is the result of differences in the states of aggregation of the aqueous Ru pre- cursors. To illustrate this concept, consider the large variation in dispersion between the low (0.78%) and high (2.9% and 4.7%) weight-loading Ru(II)/Al203 catalysts. Since the amount of hydrazine used to pre- pare these samples was constant and al- ways in excess of the stoichiometric amount, the number of RuCl3 species re- taining their composition at low weight- loadings was small. However, at the high weight-loadings, the concentration of RuCl3 was increased, thereby forming roughly equal amounts of large Ru(II) complexes and somewhat smaller RuC^ species. The result of this situation would be a floccula- tion of ruthenium due to size and charge differences. The extremely large Ru parti- cles subsequently formed and deposited on the alumina surface apparently lead to a poor dispersion of the catalyst upon activa- tion. This type of behavior was observed in Gay's studies of Ru(II)/Si02 (30), although no explanations for the phenomenon were offered. What Gay found was that by first adding RuCl3 to the support and then reduc- ing the suspension with hydrazine at a later point, much higher dispersions were real- ized than when the support was added after mixing the RuCl3 species. The result was higher dispersions than when the large floc- culated particles were allowed to form. Although the exact relationship between the aggregation of the aqueous precursor in the impregnating solution and the particle- size distribution of the finished catalyst is still unclear, this work in conjunction with prior studies suggests that such a link ex- ists. Research of the aqueous chemistry of ruthenium (25, 26, 29, 31, 49-52), Gay's work with Ru(II)/Si02 (30), and the Auger analyses of Bossi et al. (45) are consistent with the proposal that one can manipulate the dispersion of supported Ru catalysts by PREPARATION OF Ru/A^ CATALYSTS, I 213 affecting the precursor size distribution during impregnation. This study adds to the prior work by showing that the homoge- neous suspension formed from RuNO (N03)3 led to the smallest particles depos- ited on the support, Ru polymerization in RuCl3 solutions caused lower dispersions than observed with RuNO(N03)3, and the complicated interactions of chlorinated Ru polymers with Ru(II) hydrazine complexes gave rise to the largest catalytic particles and hence, the lowest dispersions. Consistency of this study with previous research is not limited to the effects of pre- cursor chemistry on Ru dispersion. Figure 4 shows the turnover frequency at 523 K as a function of the peak methanation temper- ature from the CO-TPR studies. The shape of this curve is similar to that given in Fig. 3, and fits well with the observation that increases in methanation activity are ac- 420 440 460 480 500 520 CO-TPR PEAK TEMPERATURE!

Although not incorporated in Fig. 4, turnover frequencies at various temperatures were plotted against the CO-TPR peak temperature. The shapes of the curves generated were similar to that given in Fig. 4, suggesting that this correlation between TOF and CO-TPR peak temperature is generally valid. Table 1 shows that variations in the parti- cle-size distribution of RU/A12 catalysts affect the activity of these samples by mod- ifying the number and amount of carbon- containing reaction intermediates on the surface. Note that the results of the TPSR experiments subsequent to steady-state CO hydrogation are analyzed in terms of the number of surface Ru atoms available to participate in methanation. In this way, the contribution to the total carbon inventory of each Ru atom may be assessed. The total carbon deposition as a function of the num- ber of surface atoms is shown in Fig. 5. This plot shows that for a catalyst contain- ing a larger number of surface atoms (i.e., well-dispersed), the contribution of each atom to the total carbon inventory is low. Such is the case for small ruthenium parti- cles, which have a large number of exposed metal atoms. On the other hand, the frac- tion of exposed Ru atoms is much smaller on large particles and therefore each sur- face atom contributes more carbon to the total inventory. We propose that high meth- anation activities are associated with large particles as these particles can accommo- date more reactive carbon. To test this hypothesis, the steady-state reaction time for two catalysts was adjusted so that each achieved the same turnover frequency. The samples were then sub- jected to a TPSR to determine the carbon inventory. The details of these experiments are given below. Note that catalysts de- rived from RuNO(N03)3 were chosen for this set of experiments in order to avoid any obscuring effects due to residual chloride. The 4.2% RuNO(N03)3/Al203 catalyst prepared by wet impregnation was sub- 214 MIETH AND SCHWARZ FIG. 5. Total carbon deposition vs total number of surface ruthenium atoms per gram of catalyst.

The measured methanation activity for this cat- alyst was TOP at 523 K = 29.8 x 10-3 s-'. After the TPSR experiment, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature under a flow of helium and the gas was switched to the 3 :1 HZ/CO mixture used in the steady- state experiments. The temperature was then increased at a rate of 10 K/min to 523 K and held for l h. Based on the results from the first steady-state experiment the catalyst should then produce X molecules per site of methane, X = 29.8 x 10-3 s-' x 3600 s = 107.3 molecules/site during this time frame. The catalyst was cooled under helium flow after this second methanation experiment, and a TPSR was performed to assess the carbon residues. Next, the 1.7% RuNO(N03)3/Al203 cata- lyst prepared by wet impregnation was sub- jected to the same battery of initial charac- terization tests. For this catalyst, the measured activity was slightly lower than for the 4.2% sample: TOF at 523 K = 23 x 10-3 s-'. For the 1.7% catalyst to produce the same amount of methane as the 4.2% sample, the amount of time required to hold the catalyst under the 3 : l H2/CO flow, tm, was ^ = (107.3 molec/site)/23 x 10-3 s-' = 4670 s (77.8 min). A second methanation experiment was then performed in the same manner as with the 4.2% catalyst, but the soak time was 77.8 min. As before, the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in helium, and a TPSR was performed to assess the carbon-con- taining residues. The results of these exper- iments are given in Table 2 and demon- strate that more active catalysts have a larger carbon pool associated with their particles. For example, the 4.2% catalyst has a higher activity that the 1.7% sample based on the constant-time (initial) metha- nation experiment. After each catalyst pro- duced the same amount of methane on a per site basis, the 4.2% sample had a total car- bon deposition that was roughly 40% larger than for the 1.7% catalyst. The above data suggest that one of the reasons large parti- cles are very active is that these aggregates can maintain larger amounts of carbon than small particles.

To study the effects of catalyst sintering during characterization, a second CO-TPR experiment was performed for a number of catalysts after the catalysts were exposed to a different sequence of characterization tests. After the initial battery of experi- ments (i.e., CO-TPR, steady-state CO hy- drogation, and TPSR), the 1.7% and 3.3% RuNO(N03)3/Alz03 catalysts pre- pared by wet impregnation were subjected to the constant methanation experiments and a TPSR, followed by a second CO- TPR. The 5.1% RuCl3/Al203 catalyst was simply exposed to a second CO-TPR after the initial round of tests, while the entire sequence was repeated for the Exxon test catalyst, with the only difference being that the gas flow was maintained as the 3 : l Hz/ CO mixture during cooling subsequent to the second steady-state experiment. Table 3 presents the results of these experiments. Note that for every catalyst, the dispersion drops dramatically. Since the test catalyst was the only sample whose entire charac- terization sequence was repeated, it is the only sample whose methanation activities can be directly compared for fresh and used catalysts. The fresh catalyst had a disper- sion of 14% and a TOF at 523 K of 299 10~3 s\"' with a dispersion of 4.3%. The ratio of the TOF at 523 K for the used catalyst to that at 523 K for the fresh sample is approx- imately 2. Using activity data based only on the initial dispersion of the catalyst, we find the ratio of the TOF at 523 K for a catalyst having a dispersion of 4.2% to that at 523 K Sample Ini itial Second CO- -TPR CO-TPR Peak D^ Peak temp. temp.

Our procedures would ap- pear to preclude that the decrease in disper- sion after reaction is due to blockage of the metal by highly unreactive graphitic over- layers because a second temperature ramp in Hz showed no release ofCFL. Thus, the results suggest that metal particles are in- deed sintering and that other processes, such as a repartitioning of chloride to the support, are not occurring during charac- terization. SUMMARY Previous research has shown that changes in the size of supported Ru parti- cles affect the performance of the finished catalyst. In addition, prior work has dem- onstrated that Ru particle size may be ma- nipulated by increasing the metal loading on a given support of altering the support for a given Ru precursor. Our research ex- tends this work by demonstrating that changes in dispersion can be easily accom- plished by changing the precursor used in preparing a supported Ru catalyst. Indeed, much lower dispersions than previously measured for Ru/Ali03 catalysts were achieved by preparing Ru(II) impregnating 216 MIETH AND SCHWARZ solutions. This led to methanation activities over three times larger than would be ex- pected based on the work of King for cata- lysts of comparable dispersion. It is sug- gested that variations in the dispersion of the catalysts studied are related to differ- ences in the aqueous chemistry of Ru pre- cursors used. The formation of large spe- cies in solution leads to large catalytic particles on the support that can accommo- date more reactive carbon intermediates, thereby enhancing the TOF.

YJCAT 89903114 0021-9517(89)90311-4 10.1016/0021-9517(89)90311-4 The effect of catalyst preparation on the performance of alumina-supported ruthenium catalysts I. The impact of catalytic precursor on particle size and catalytic activity Jeffrey A. Mieth James A. Schwarz 1 Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244 U.S.A. 1 To whom all correspondence should be addressed. The effect of preparation method and the choice of metallic precursor on the performance of a series of Ru Al2O3 catalysts were studied. Wet impregnation and incipient wetness were the methods employed; ruthenium nitrosylnitrate and ruthenium trichloride were the reagents. In the latter case, either Ru(III) Ru(IV) chlorospecies or mixtures of Ru(II) hydrazine complexes were the catalytic precursors. The series of Ru Al2O3 catalysts, with metal loadings from 0.7–5% by weight, were subjected to a battery of performance tests: CO temperature-programmed reaction, steadystate CO hydrogenation, and temperature-programmed surface reaction. The methanation activity and carbon deposited during steady-state reaction varied systematically with the dispersion of Ru on the alumina. High rates of methane production were found on catalysts containing a large reservoir of carbon-containing reaction intermediates. The performance of these catalysts depended on the precursor used in their preparation. The effects of weight loading, method of preparation, and variations in the impregnant pH were small within a group prepared from a Common precursor. References 1. M.A. Vannice J.
