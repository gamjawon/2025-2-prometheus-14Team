Keywords: Succinimdeâ€�Nâ€�sulfonic acid Protection Acetylation Chemoselective reaction Solventâ€�free condition Â 1. Introduction The protection of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines by the formation of esters and amides is one of the most important and widely used transformations in organic chemistry [1], esâ€� pecially with polyfunctional molecules such as nucleosides, carbohydrates, steroids, and natural products [2, 3]. A variety of procedures are routinely used for the preparation of acetyl derivatives using homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts such as 4â€�dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4â€�pyrolidinoâ€� pyridine [4], tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) [5], Bu3P [6], iodine [7], pâ€�toluenesulfonic acid [8], alumina [9], zinc chloâ€� ride [10], cobalt chloride [11], montmorillonit Kâ€�10 and KSF [12], zeolite HSZâ€�360 [13], zirconium sulfophenyl phosphonate [15], Sc(OTf)3 [15], TaCl5 [16], trimethylsilyl trifluoroâ€� methanesulfonate (TMSOTf) [17], Cu(OTf)2 [18], In(OTf)3 [19], magnesium bromide [20], bismuth(III) salts [21], ferric perâ€� chlorate adsorbed on silicaâ€�gel [22], RuCl3 [23], InCl3 [24], Ce(OTf)3 [25], Mg(ClO4)2 [26], ZrCl4 [27], Cp2ZrCl2 [28], and cerium polyoxometalate [29]. However, each of these methods suffer from some disadvantages such as high temperature and drastic reaction conditions, formation of undesirable or toxic byproducts, expensive reagents, the reagents are hygroscopic or thermally unstable, use of halogenated solvents and strong acids, long reaction times or low yields of the desired products, and in most cases are only applicable to alcohols. Therefore, a new method and catalyst for the preparation of esters and amâ€� ides is still in demand. Acylals (1,1â€�diacetates) are remarkably stable derivatives of aldehydes that are widely used for the protection of comâ€� pounds. They also have many applications in organic synthesis and industry. 1,1â€�Diacetates are useful precursors in asymmetâ€� ric allylic alkylation [30], synthesis of natural products [31], and synthesis of 1â€�acetoxy dienes and 2,2â€�dichlorovinyl aceâ€� tates for Dielsâ€�Alder reactions [32,33]. In addition, the acylal functionality can be converted to other functional groups by reaction with the appropriate nucleophiles [34,35]. In addition, 1,1â€�diacetates are used as crossâ€�linking agents for the cellulose in cotton and as bleaching initiators in wineâ€�stained fabrics [36,37]. Hence, methods for their synthesis have received conâ€� * Corresponding author.

Usually the preparation of 1,1â€�diacetates are carried out by the reaction of aldehydes with acetic anhydride using catalysts such as H2SO4 [38], H3PO4 and CH3SO3H [33], NH2SO3H [39], HClO4â€�SiO4 [40], Zr(HSO4)4 [41], saccharin sulfonic acid [42], [Hmim]HSO4 [43], pâ€�toluenesulfonic acid (pâ€�TSA) [44], siliâ€� caâ€�bonded Sâ€�sulfonic acid [45], silicasuloric acid [46], copper methanesulfonateâ€�HOAc [47], 1,3â€�dibromoâ€�5,5â€� dimethylhyâ€� dantoin [48], ZnCl2 [49], FeCl3 [50], PCl3 [51], InCl3 [52], cyâ€� anuric chloride [53], ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) [54], NBS [55], WCl6 [56], SbCl3 [57, 58], ZrCl4 [59], LiClO4 [60], Sc(OTf)3 [61], Cu(OTf)2 [62], Bi(OTf)3 [63], LiOTf, [64], In(OTf)3 [65], montmorillonite clay [66], expansive graphite [67], H3PMo12O40 [68], H6P2W1O62âˆ™24H2O [69], AlPW12O40 [70], zirconium sulâ€� fophenyl phosphonate [71] or Bi(NO3)3Â·5H2O [72]. Although some of these catalysts can convert aldehydes to the correâ€� sponding diacetates with good to high yields, the majority sufâ€� fer from at least one disadvantages such as prolonged reaction times, reaction under oxidizing conditions, use of a strong acid, low yields, harsh reaction conditions, difficulty in the preparaâ€� tion, moisture sensitivity of the reagent used, or high cost and high toxicity of the reagent used. Therefore, there is scope for developing an alternative method for the protection of aldeâ€� hydes as acylals. 2. Experimental 2.1. General All chemicals were purchased from Merck or Fluka Chemiâ€� cal Companies. All yields refer to the isolated products. Prodâ€� ucts were characterized by their physical constants and comâ€� parison with standard samples. The determination of the purity of the substrates and reaction monitoring were performed by TLC using silica gel SIL G/UV 254 plates. The MS were measâ€� ured under 70 eV conditions. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 781 spectrophotometer. The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance 400 or 300 MHz instruâ€� ment. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. 13 C NMR data were collected on a Bruker Avance 100 or 75 MHz instrument. Melting points were recorded on a BÃ¼chi Bâ€�545 apparatus with open capillary tubes. 2.2. Acetylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines with different amounts of succinimide Nâ€�sulfonic acid The substrate (1.0 mmol) was treated with Ac2O (1.5â€“2 mmol) in the presence of succinimide Nâ€�sulfonic acid (SuSA, 0.028 mmol) at room temperature under solvent free condiâ€� tions and with magnetic stirring. After the completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the mixture was diluted with Et2O (25 ml) and the catalyst was allowed to settle down. The suâ€� pernatant ethereal solution was decanted off, the catalyst washed with Et2O (2 ml) and the combined ethereal solution was concentrated under vacuum to afford the product. The product had identical physical properties (mp, IR, 1H and 13 C NMR, and GCMS) as a standard sample of the acetylated prodâ€� uct. The recovered catalyst was dried at 50 Â°C under vacuum for 2 h and reused for four more acetylation reactions of benzyl alcohol (1.0 mmol) affording 98%, 97%, 97%, and 96% yields, respectively, in 2, 3, 3, and 5 min. 2.3. Acetylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines with different substrates A mixture of 1 mmol substrate, 2â€“3 mmol acetic anhydride, and 5 mg SuSA (0.028 mmol) was stirred at room temperature in the absence of a solvent. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was diluted with 15 ml ethyl acetate and filtered. Then the solid residue was washed with 5 ml ethyl acetate, then 5 ml acetone and then dried. The recovered catalyst could be used for three more reaction runs. The organic layer was washed with 5 ml of a saturated solution of NaHCO3, 20 ml brine and 20 ml water, and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of the solvent followed by column chromatography on silica gel followed by evaporation of the solvent gave the desired product in good to high yields. 2.4.

For this product (entry 31), a series of molecular ab initio calculations were carried out to understand the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 2â€�(Nâ€�benzylacetamido)ethyl acetate. Calculaâ€� Farhad SHIRINI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 695â€“703 Â tions were performed with the Gaussian 98 set of programs [73] on a personal computer (Pentium 4). Geometry optimizaâ€� tion were done both at the Hartreeâ€�Fock level with analytic gradients and with the 6â€�31G* basis set. The results demonâ€� strated that the product can exist in many conformations, and two conformations (I) and (II) were identified that had the lowest energy conformation. Figure 1 shows the result of rotaâ€� tion around the bond connecting the C1â€“C2â€“N3â€“C4 atoms. The conformational heterogeneity of this product and the high inâ€� terâ€�conversion barriers are due to the high steric demand of the acetamide group with the orthoâ€�position hydrogen atoms of the phenyl ring.

Results and discussion Recently, we reported the preparation of succinâ€� imideâ€�Nâ€�sulfonic acid (SuSA) (Scheme 1) and its application to the trimethylsilylation of hydroxyl groups and deprotection of the obtained trimethylsilyl ethers [74] and Nâ€�Boc protection of amines [75]. In a continuation of these studies, we investigated the apâ€� plicability of this reagent as the catalyst for other organic funcâ€� tional group transformations. Our investigations clarified that SuSA can efficiently catalyze the acetylation of alcohols, pheâ€� nols, amines, and thiols with Ac2O in the absence of a solvent (Scheme 2).

Acetylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines catalyzed by SuSA. Farhad SHIRINI et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis 34 (2013) 695â€“703 Â In order to optimize the reaction conditions, different amounts of succinimideâ€�Nâ€�sulfonic acid (SuSA) were used to make benzyl acetate from benzyl alcohol and acetic anhydride at room temperature under solvent free conditions. The results are summarized in Table 1. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of small catalytic amounts of SuSA in the absence of a solvent, and the yields were excellent. It should be noted that when the reaction used a solvent, the reaction time beâ€� came longer or the reaction did not proceed at all. The reaction did not occur in the absence of the catalyst (Table 1, entry 1). After these preliminary experiments, a small catalytic amount of SuSA (2.8 mol%) was used to convert a variety of functionalized alcohols and phenols with acetic anhydride into the corresponding esters and amides at room temperature under solvent free conditions. As shown in Table 2, different types of benzylic (including those with electron donating or withdrawing groups) and aliphatic alcohols underwent acetyâ€� lation with Ac2O (1.5â€“2.0 equiv) in the presence of catalytic amounts of SuSA in the absence of a solvent at room temperaâ€� ture in good to high yields. The reaction conditions were mild enough not to induce any damage to moieties like the methoxy group (Table 2, entry 8), which often undergoes cleavage in the presence of strong acids or some Lewis acids. With sterically hindered alcohols, excellent chemoselectivity was observed as these compounds did not show any competitive dehydration (Table 2, entries 9â€“16). In order to show the mildness and steâ€� reospecificity of the SuSA catalyzed acetylation of alcohols, the reactions of optically active L(â€“)â€�menthol and R(+)â€�borneol were studied (Table 2, entries 12 and 16). We observed that L(â€“)â€�menthol ([Î±]D = â€“49.0 o , c = 10 in 95% ethanol, 99% ee) and R(+)â€�Borneol ([Î±]D = +37.9 o , c = 5 in ethanol, 99% ee) reâ€� acted enantioselectively with the retention of the configuration on the benzylic center to provide Lâ€�(â€“)â€�Menthyl acetate ([Î±]D = â€“73.0 o , neat, 98% ee) and (+)â€�Bornyl acetate ([Î±]D = +41.5 o , neat, 96% ee). The highest optical purity was obtained as an optically pure form in high yield and high regioselectivity by using SuSA at room temperature under solvent free conditions. The optical rotation of the product was determined and comâ€� pared with that reported by Aldrich. Our investigations showed that under the same reaction conditions, SuSA catalyzed the acetylation of phenols, amines, and thiols in good to high yields (Table 2, entries 17â€“36). Our protocol has the advantages that two or three groups were acetylated with the reaction conditions (Table 2, entries 20â€“23, 29â€“32, and 35) and furyl mercaptane was transformed smoothly to the corresponding acetate derivative (Table 2, entry 36). SuSA was a reusable catalyst and after five runs of the acetâ€� ylation of benzyl alcohol with acetic anhydride, the catalytic activity of SuSA was almost the same as that of the fresh cataâ€� Table 1 Reaction of benzyl alcohol and Ac2O in the presence of different amounts of SuSA at room temperature under solvent free conditions.

To illustrate the efficiency of this catalyst, we compare the results of the acetylation of benzyl alcohol with acetic anhyâ€� dride catalyzed by SuSA with some results reported in the litâ€� erature (Table 3). It is clear that our reaction system is superior in terms of reaction time, catalyst amount, and product yield. The probable mechanism is shown in Scheme 3. Acetic anâ€� hydride is first activated by SuSA to afford (I). Alcohol, phenol, amine or thiol attacks I which in turn is converted to the final product and releases SuSA for the next catalytic cycle (Scheme 3). The selectivity of this reaction system was checked with the competitive acetylation of benzyl alcohol, phenol, aniline, and thiophenol together. The results showed that aniline was acetâ€� Table 2 SuSA catalyzed acetylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines with Ac2O at room temperature under solventâ€�free conditions.

This can be considered as a useful practical achievement in the acetylation of amines in the presence of alcohols, phenols and thiols. Also, benzyl alcoâ€� hol was acetylated selectively in the presence of phenol and thiophenol in 88%:12% and 85.6%:14.4% yields, respectively (Table 4, entries 3 and 4). Phenol was acetylated in the presâ€� ence of thiophenol in 64:36% yield (Table 4, entry 5). Notably, the conversion of 4â€�chlorobenzyl alcohol to the acâ€� etate product can be carried out on a larger scale (10 mmol) with 92% yield in 10 min by using 5 mg (0.028 mmol) of SuSA. This indicates that a large scale reaction is possible with the same amount of the catalyst. It is important to point out that the present reaction system is clean, and does not need a chromatographic separation. After the above study, we found that SuSA also efficiently catalyzed the conversion of aldehydes to their corresponding 1,1â€�diacetates with acetic anhydride (Scheme 4). The results are tabulated in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, different types of aromatic aldehydes with different substituents such as NO2, Cl, Br, CN, Me, and MeO were converted to their corresponding acylals in good to high yields (Table 5, entries 1â€“15). In hydroxyl containing aromatic aldehydes, the phenol â€“OH groups were also acylated in high yields (Table 5, entries 16â€“18). Using this catalyst, furfural as an acid sensitive substrate was also protected in high yield and without the formation of any side products, which are normally formed under strongly acidic conditions (Table 5, entry 19). The catalyst is also very useful for the protection of aliphatic and Î±,Î²â€�unsaturated aldehydes (Table 5, entries 20â€“22). No isomerisation of conjugated aldehydes was observed in the presence of SuSA. The acetylation of phthalaldehyde gave the diacetylated product in good yield (85%) accompanied by a minor amount (12%) of the tetraacylated product (Table 5, entry 23). For isoâ€�phthalaldehyde and tereâ€�phethalaldehyde, the tetraâ€�acylated products were obtained in high yields (Table Table 4 Competitive acetylation of benzyl alcohol, phenol, thiophenol and aniline catalyzed by NSPVPC.

However, 4â€�(dimethylamino) benzaldeâ€� hyde and indoleâ€�3â€�carbaldehyde failed to give the correspondâ€� ing 1,1â€�diacetates under the same conditions, which may be due to the electron donation ability of the dimethylamino and NH groups (Table 5, entries 26 and 27). To evaluate the chemoselectivity of the catalyst, the comâ€� petitive reactions for the acylation of aldehydes in the presence of ketones using SuSA as catalyst was also investigated. A highâ€� ly selective conversion of aldehydes in the presence of ketones was observed (Table 5, entries 28 and 29). In addition to economic benefits, a successful recycling of a catalyst will also lead to a cleaner process, because this will not leave any catalyst contamination in the products. We found that SuSA can be effectively recovered from the reaction mixture during the workâ€�up procedure (Table 5, entry 6). The percent of recovery in most cases was more than 80% and there was no change in the catalytic activity of SuSA. As outlined in Scheme 5, the possible mechanism of this reâ€� action may involve either intermolecular or intramolecular transfer of the second acetate group after the initial attack by acetic anhydride. The role of the catalyst here is the activation of the carbonyl group for these nucleophilic attacks. In order to show the merit of the present work, Table 6 compares the results obtained from the gem acylation of benâ€� zaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde by our reaction system with some of those reported in the literature.

Conclusions The acetylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, amines, and alâ€� dehydes with acetic anhydride are efficiently catalyzed by Suâ€� SA, which is a newly prepared succinimideâ€�based reagent. High yields, short reaction times, mildness of the reaction conditions, ease of the preparation, stability and reusability of the reagent, chemoselectivity and easy workâ€�up are the advantages of this catalytic reaction system.

Tel/Fax: +98-131-3233262 A small amount of succinimide-N-sulfonic acid efficiently catalyzed the acetylation of a variety alcohols, phenols, thiols, amines and aldehydes with acetic anhydride at room temperature under solvent free conditions. This catalyst has the advantages of excellent yields and short reaction times and the reaction can be carried out on a large scale, which makes it potentially useful for industrial applications. Graphical abstract Succinimide-N-sulfonic acid was prepared by a simple route and shown to be an efficient catalyst for the acetylation of a variety alcohols, phenols, thiols, amines, and aldehydes with acetic anhydride at room temperature under solvent free conditions.
