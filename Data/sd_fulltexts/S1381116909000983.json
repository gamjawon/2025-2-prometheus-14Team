Keywords Kinetics Photocatalysis Zinc oxide Direct Yellow 12 1 Introduction In textile finishing and dyeing industries, large amount of water is consumed in dyeing and washing of the fabrics. Considering both the volume discharged and the effluent composition, the wastewater generated by the textile and dyeing industry is rated as the most polluting among all the industrial sectors. The removal of colour from the textile wastewater is achieved either by separation or oxidation techniques. The separation techniques such as chemical coagulation and adsorption are not environmental friendly, since they generate large amount of sludge that require disposal. The oxidative decolourization techniques also have several limitations, e.g., biological oxidation is not effective, oxidation with H2O2 requires long reaction time and oxidation with ozone is costly. Hence there is a need for a suitable technology for decolourization of textile dyeing wastewater. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are alternative methods for the complete degradation of organic contaminants [1–3]. Photocatalytic process which is emerging as an AOP has been applied to the treatment of several dye stuffs [4]. The most commonly studied photocatalysts are TiO2, ZnO and CdS [5,6]. Among the various semiconductors the TiO2 is generally considered to be the best photocatalyst and has been widely used for the detoxification of water from a number of organic pollutants [7–9]. However, wide spread use of TiO2 is uneconomical for large-scale water treatment operations. ZnO has been found to be a suitable alternative to TiO2 and is in fact proved to be more efficient than TiO2 in the photodegradation of pesticide carbetamide and herbicide triclopyr [10,11]. Lizama et al. [12] reported that ZnO is a more efficient catalyst than TiO2 in the photodegradation of reactive blue 19. In the present investigation photocatalytic degradation of DY 12 in the presence of ZnO with UV light as the illuminant has been reported. It is the most commonly used dye in leather, paper, silk, wool and nylon industries. The effect of various parameters such as pH, catalyst weight and the initial concentration of dye on the degradation of the dye has been examined and the results obtained are discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials The dye DY12, commercially known as direct fast yellow GCH (C.I. 24895) was obtained from local dye suppliers. The dye was used as such without further purification. The dye shows an absorption maximum at 390nm and the structure of the dye is shown in Fig. 1 . Zinc oxide (99.8% purity), used as photocatalyst was obtained from Merck. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area of ZnO was determined by flow method using Micromeritics pulse chemisorb 2700. The surface area of ZnO was found to be 8m2/g. All other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from CDH or Merck and used as such. The desired concentrations of the dye solutions were prepared using double distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to the desired values between 4.0 and 10.0 by using dilute solutions of HCl or NaOH. 2.2 Photocatalytic reactor The photodegradation studies were carried out in a batch reactor system. The reactor consisted of a rectangular tray of 16cm×5cm×5cm made of borosilicate glass, mounted suitably on a magnetic stirrer. The radiation source was a low-pressure mercury vapour lamp (6W, 18cm long) emitting ultraviolet radiation with a peak wave length of 253.7nm. The lamp was fitted on the top of the reactor. The light source used in the photocatalysis experiments was standardized by ferrioxalate actinometry and its intensity was found to be 2.48±0.1×1019 quanta per second. 2.3 Procedures The optimum conditions used in the present study was a batch volume of 250mL, 8cm distance between UV source and solution with a stirring speed of 70rpm and 30min time for adsorption equilibrium. In all the experiments, the dye solution of known concentration containing a suspension of known weight of catalyst powder was irradiated with UV light. Samples of 3mL were withdrawn at regular intervals of time and centrifuged. Absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured and returned to the reactor. The quantitative estimation of the dye was carried out using a Systronics single beam, UV–visible spectrophotometer, model −118 at λ max of 390nm. The estimation of total organic carbon (TOC) of the dye solution after photocatalytic degradation was determined using closed reactor. In this 35mL of known concentration of the dye solution was taken in the annular space between the UV lamp – quartz assembly and the outer glass column of closed reactor with the inner wall of glass column coated with ZnO. The inlet was connected to the aerator and the outlet tube was immersed in KOH solution of known concentration taken in a gas-washing bottle. After irradiating the dye solution for specific duration, the KOH solution was titrated against standardized HCl by volumetry [13]. A blank was run with 35mL of water through the same procedure to nullify the errors due to dissolved CO2 from aeration. The amount of KOH neutralized by liberated CO2 of organic carbon present in the dye sample was calculated and compared with the theoretical values calculated on the basis of the known stoichiometry of the reaction. The inorganic minerals in the treated samples were determined by standard methods of estimations. The nitrate concentration in the samples was determined by UV–visible spectrophotometer at 225nm. The ammoniacal nitrogen present in the samples was estimated by forming an intensely blue coloured indophenol by reaction with hypochlorite and phenol, catalyzed by manganous sulphate. The measurement of absorbance at 630nm enabled the calculation of ammoniacal nitrogen in the samples. The sulphate ion concentration in the samples was determined by gravimetric analysis as barium sulphate precipitate. The stability of ZnO was assessed by subjecting the irradiated solutions to atomic absorption spectroscopic (PerkinElmer 2380) analysis and the amount of zinc in solution resulting from dissolution or photocorrosion was determined. The reusability of catalyst was evaluated by reclaiming the catalyst of the reaction in the batch mode, washing, drying in air at 110°C and using it for the dye degradation under similar experimental conditions. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Photodegradability of Direct Yellow 12 The photodegradability of the dye was investigated by exposing the dye solution to UV light in the absence and in the presence of ZnO photocatalyst. The dye did not undergo any decolourization or degradation under direct UV irradiation in the absence of ZnO. In the absence of UV light and in the presence of ZnO in dark about 35% of the dye was adsorbed on ZnO surface under specified conditions. However, on irradiation with UV light in the presence of ZnO (with a band gap energy of 3.2eV), the dye was completely degraded in about an hour as shown in Fig. 2 . The dye solution was analyzed for TOC and inorganic ions after complete degradation. Qualitative analysis of irradiated solution indicated the presence of nitrate, ammonium and sulphate ions. All the organic components were oxidized quantitatively to carbon dioxide as indicated by TOC determination. Carbondioxide determined experimentally was found to tally with the theoretical values on the basis of molecular weight and concentration of the dye employed. The percentage of carbon photooxidized in aqueous suspension was 98% of the theoretical value. The mineral content of the reaction mixture was estimated quantitatively by standard methods of analysis and results obtained agreed well with the theoretical values of nitrogen and sulphur content of the dye. Results confirmed the complete mineralization of the dye molecule as shown in Table 1 . 3.2 Effect of solution pH The effect of pH on the degradation of the dye was studied in the pH range of 4.0–10.0. A linear increase in the initial rate of the degradation of the dye was observed in the presence of ZnO. The initial rate values increased from 0.5 to 1.4μM/min with increasing the pH from 4.0 to 10.0. The lower rate of degradation at acidic pH may be attributed to dissolution of ZnO at low pH. At higher pH, there was excess of OH− anions, which facilitate the formation of OH radicals as suggested in the literature [14,15]. So the optimum pH for the removal of DY12 was found to be pH 10. Similar behaviour was also reported for the photodegradation of dyes acid red 18 and rhodamine 6G [16,5]. 3.3 Effect of catalyst weight The effect of photocatalyst weight on the photodegradation of the dye was studied in the range of 1.0–5.0g/L. A small but significant increase in the rate of the degradation observed with an increase in the catalyst weight up to an optimum loading. The optimum weight of catalyst loading was found to be in the range of 3.0–4.0g/L. Further increase in catalyst weight resulted in the decrease of the reaction rate as shown in Fig. 3 . This can be explained in terms of availability of active sites on the catalyst surface and the penetration of UV light into the suspension. The total active surface area increases with increasing catalyst weight. But at the catalyst weight above optimum loading there is a decrease in UV light penetration due to screening effect of excess catalyst particle in the solution. Hence, the initial rate decreases at the higher catalyst loading. Similar results were reported in the decolourization of acid red 14 on ZnO [17]. 3.4 Effect of dye concentration on the photocatalytic degradation The photocatalytic degradation of the dye was carried out at different initial dye concentrations ranging from 10 to 60μM. The initial rate of photodegradation of the dye increased from 0.3 to 1.1μM/min with an increase in concentration from 10 to 50μM and at higher concentrations the rate remain constant. At higher concentration a greater number of dye molecules are adsorbed virtually masking the surface of the catalyst particle and preventing the photons interacting with the catalyst [18]. 3.5 Kinetic analysis Photocatalytic degradation of the dye at low concentrations obeyed first order kinetics. The linear plot of log C 0/C versus irradiation time t is shown in Fig. 4 . The effect of solute concentration on the rate of photocatalytic degradation can be explained on the basis of Langmuir–Hinshelwood expression [19] as given below. r = k 1 k 2 C 0 1 + k 1 C 0 where k 1, k 2 and C 0 are adsorption constant, specific rate constant and initial concentration of the dye respectively. The applicability of equation was confirmed by the linear plot obtained by reciprocal of initial rate 1/r against reciprocal of initial concentration of the dye 1/C 0 (Fig. 5 ). The values of k 1and k 2 were found to be 0.0064μM−1 and 5.11μM/min respectively. The product of k 1and k 2 was found to be tallied with the apparent rate constant value obtained at low initial dye concentrations. The integrated form of the above equation can be mentioned as follows. t = 1 k 1 k 2 ln C 0 C + 1 k 2 ( C 0 − C ) where t is the time in minutes required for the initial concentration of the dye C 0 to decrease to C. Since the dye concentration is very low, the second term of the expression becomes small when compared with the first one and under these conditions the above equation reduces to ln C 0 C ≈ k 1 k 2 t = k ′ t . A plot of ln C 0/C versus irradiation time ‘t’ should give a straight line, whose slope is equal to the apparent first order rate constant k′. This was confirmed by the linear plot of log C 0/C versus time for various initial concentrations of the dye (vide Fig. 4). Additional support for this conclusion arises from the following equation. t 0.5 = 0.5 Co k 2 + 0.693 k 1 k 2 A plot of t 0.5 versus 0.5 Co yielded straight line (Fig. 6 ), whose slope is 1/k 2 and slope/intercept is k 1/0.693. 3.6 Mechanism of photocatalytic degradation In order to determine the relative importance of the possible mechanism and also to confirm the nature of the oxidative species involved in the reaction, the photocatalytic oxidation of the dye (50μM) was investigated by the use of additives such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or hydrogen peroxide and by bubbling oxygen or nitrogen. The photocatalytic degradation of the dye, DY12 was carried out in the presence of ZnO by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, a known hole scavenger [20]. Even very low concentration of IPA (10mM) hindered the degradation rate of the dye to a large extent and the degradation rate decreased from 1.1 to 0.3μM/min with an increase of IPA concentration to 20mM. The decrease in the rate was due to the holes that were formed and were trapped by IPA which prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals. However higher concentration of IPA (50mM) did not stop the oxidation completely, indicating that oxidants other than holes are also involved. Direct oxidation by electron vacancies may be suggested as reported by Richard and Boule [21]. Hydrogen peroxide, an electron scavenger accepts a photogenerated electron from the conduction band and thus prevents electron–hole recombination forming OH radicals [22]. In addition, UV photons (from radiation sources) facilitate the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, forming hydroxyl radicals [23]. ZnO mediated photocatalytic degradation reactions were carried out with the addition of H2O2 in the range of 50–100mM. Experimental results indicated that the initial degradation rate of dye increased from 1.1 to 1.9μM/min with addition of H2O2 (100mM). This implies that H2O2 increases the hydroxyl radical formation, thereby increasing the reaction rate, confirming the participation of hydroxyl radicals in the photocatalytic process. The photocatalytic degradation reactions were carried out in the presence of ZnO by bubbling oxygen or nitrogen in a closed reactor. The percentage removal of DY12 after a given irradiation time (10min) with ZnO in the presence and absence of oxygen was observed. The extent of removal of dye was found to be 73% in the presence of oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, under nitrogen atmosphere the removal of dye decreased to 12%. In the oxygenated solution oxygen may adsorb on the surface of the photocatalyst, preventing electron–hole recombination by trapping electron and producing superoxide anion radicals. However in the presence of nitrogen, the formation of superoxide anion radical is prevented. Hence the reaction rate is suppressed. These experiments have clearly demonstrated the involvement of holes, hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion radicals as oxidants in the ZnO mediated photocatalytic oxidation of DY12. 3.7 Reusability of photocatalyst Reusability of ZnO photocatalyst for the degradation of dye, DY12 was evaluated. The solution resulting from the photocatalytic degradation of the dye was filtered, washed and the photocatalyst was dried. The dried catalyst samples were used for the degradation of the dye, under similar conditions. The filtrate was subjected to AAS analysis to assess the loss of Zn2+ ions to solutions as a result of dissolution of photocatalyst. Under the present investigation, it was observed that the dissolution of photocatalyst was found to be negligible (0.04% loss of zinc was observed during 2h of reaction time). The photocatalyst ZnO could be used repeatedly without any treatment and the catalytic activity of reused catalyst was found to be same as the original catalyst even up to five batch reactions. The initial rate of photodegradation of the dye decreased from 1.1 to 1.05μM/min after the fifth cycle of reuse. The loss in activity and loss of zinc as zinc ions was more pronounced only after the fifth cycle of reuse. The percentage reduction in the rates of photocatalytic degradation of DY12 after five cycles was found to be 4.5. 4 Conclusions The degradation of dye DY12 was found to be favourable in alkaline media. The degradation rate is increased with increase in initial concentration of the dye and reached a limiting value. At higher concentrations the reaction rates were remained constant. ZnO was found to be quite stable and undergoes photocorrosion only to a negligible extent. The photocatalytic degradation of the dye followed first order kinetics and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is found to be valid. The oxidants involved in the photodegradation reactions were identified as holes (h+), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide anion radicals (O2 −). Acknowledgement Authors are thankful to Dr. J.
