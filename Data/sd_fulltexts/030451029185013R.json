Ltd., 10-1 Tsukahara 2 Chome, Takatsuki-Shi, Osaka 569 (Japan) (Received October 12, 1990; accepted February 8, 1991) The water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) is one of the most important processes from the viewpoints of industrial utilization of carbon monoxide and of a pure hydrogen source [ 1 ]. As one of its applications related to the WGSR, the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds under CO/H20 system has attracted considerable attention [2]. Many studies have already been carried out on this subject; however, catalytic reduction with high activity under mild reaction conditions has not yet been reported [3]. Recently, we reported that chelate phosphine-added Rh-carbonyl complexes exhibited remarkably high catalytic activities for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds, affording the corresponding amines under extremely mild reaction conditions of room temperature and of atmospheric CO pressure [4]. ArN02 + 3C0 + H20 ---o ArNH2 + 3C02 In the present paper, we report that 9,10-diaminophenanthrene-added Rh4(CO)12 complex also shows significant catalytic activities for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds under the same mild reaction conditions**. Catalytic reduction was typically carried out as follows: a solution of Rh4(CO)12 (0.02 mmol) in 2-methoxyethanol (15 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere was stirred and the required amount of 9,10-diaminophenanthrene added. Then, addition of 5 N NaOH aqueous solution (5 ml) and aromatic nitro compounds (5 mmol) into the reaction mixture was followed by the introduction of carbon monoxide. The mixture, equipped with a CO gas bag, *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. **We have recently found other new catalyst systems for the selective reduction of aromatic nitro compounds under the extremely mild reaction conditions of room temperature and of CO atmosphere (for example, Rh-, Ru-carbonyl complexes with phosphine, chelate phosphine, amine, etc. catalyst systems). These papers will be published elsewhere. 0304-5102O 1/$3.50 (r) Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands L2 was allowed to react at room temperature (25 C). The reaction product was then determined by GLC using an internal standard, and was identified using GLC by co-injection with the authentic sample (column OV-225) and GC-MS (QP-1000 Shimazu Co.). The reaction product was the corresponding amine, and no other products were obtained*. Results for the reduction of PhN02 with various 9,10-diaminophenanthrene/Rh ratios for 3 h are shown in Table 1. The reduction rate was remarkably increased by the addition of 9,10-diaminophenanthrene (from 108 to 225 turnovers with a diamine/Rh ratio varying from 0 to 2.25, respectively). Turnovers of 610 mol-cat-1 for 3 h were obtained at low Rh4(CO)12 concentration. It was also found that the reduction rate decreased (32 turnovers after 3 h) under atmospheric hydrogen pressure using Rh4(CO)12 catalyst**. This result clearly indicates that the reduction under CO/H20 using this catalyst system did not proceed by the reaction of aromatic nitro compounds and hydrogen generated from the WGSR, and thus suggests that a different reaction mechanism can be considered for this reduction under CO/H20. Results for the reduction of various substituted aromatic nitro compounds using the Rh4(CO)12-9,10-diaminophenanthrene catalyst system for 90 min are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that these reductions proceed not only with significant rates, but also with extremely high nitro-group selectivities. Reductions were completed by further stirring. The order pNH2 > o-NH2 > p-Cl > o-Cl > p-Me, p-OMe > H was obtained for this reaction, which is somewhat different from that previously obtained using the Rh4(CO)12dppe catalyst system (p-NH2(> 250) > o-Ci(210) > o-NH2(190) >pCl(158) >p-OMe(I40); p-Me(128) > H(110 turnovers, mol-cat-1 for 90 min)) although the high nitro-group selectivities were almost the same as those obtained using the Rh-dppe catalyst system [4].

This information is, we believe, potentially important from the industrial point of view as well as from the synthetic viewpoint, as it may be used commercially to produce amines by selective catalytic reduction. An original mechanism for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds under CO/H20 conditions, such as via a Rh-nitrene intermediate (Rh=NAr) is suggested from the above results [5]. Mechanistic studies for this reaction using this catalyst system are now under investigation.
