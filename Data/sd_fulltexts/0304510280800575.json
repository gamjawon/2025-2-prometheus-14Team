Lausanne - Printed in the Netherlands Short Communication Ruthenium Phosphine Complexes as Catalysts for the Hydrosilylation of the C=C Bond 13OGDAN MARCOC and aACEK GULLISKI Institute of Chemistry, A. Mickiewiez University, Poznari (Poland) (Received January 17, 1979; is revised form duly 2, 1980) Low spin d' ruthenium(I) and dB ruthenium(0), as well as ds Ru(II) complexes, in contrast to the four and five coordinated ones (especially d$), have not as yet been involved in the catalytic homogeneous addition of trisudstituted qilanes to the C=C bond. The addition of trichlorosilane to acrylonitrile both the high yield of 9390 was the only reaction observed by Hetilels and coworkers in the presence of dichlorotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) [1] . Detailed experiments have shown, however, that the virtual catalyst was in this case triphenylphosphine, released as a result of dissociation of the complex. The reaction proceeds apparently according to the nucleophilic mechanism of catalytic hydrosilylation. Besides the above reaction, Czechoslovak authors did not find any adducts in the reactions of tzisubstituted (trichloro-, triethogy-, triethyl-) silanes both a variety of olefins, carried out essentially in benzene solutions. They observed instead the formation of five- and six-coordinated hydridosilyi- and bis(silylphesphine) complexes of ruthenium(II) which were isolated [ 1] . Recently I ono et al. have reported results of their extensive investigation of reactions of silicon hydrides with dichloro- and chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(ff) complexes- [2] . They have found that when trialkogy-, trichloroand methy1dichlorosilanes interact with ruthenium(II) complexes in ;he absence of benzene, the four coordinated hydridosilyl bisphosphine ruthenium(II) was precipitate in an excess of silane. Contrazy to the results of the extensive studies by Hetflej's and Kono, our preliminary examination of the hydroQlylation of the I-alkenes and vinyltrialkogysilanes by trialkoxysilanes catalyzed by RuC12(PL3h3)3 gave unexpectedly the adducts both terminal stlyl groups [3] . Trace quantities of some additional products of oxidation and redistribution of silane as well as of isomerisation of IOenes and a-adducts wer=e observed but not to an extent larger than 5 - 7%. RuC12(PPh3)3 and RuHCI(PPh3)3 also catalyze the addition of triethogysilane to other olefin derivatives such as allyl anal vinyl compounds, brut the yield and selectivity of the adducts are usually lower ('Fable 1).

[ 1 ] , studied in the presence of molecular oxygen (e.g. in air) instead of an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen. The products were analyzed using GLC techniques. '!'here are two essential requirements for the addition of trialkogy- silanes to the C=C bond to proceed at all in the presence of ruthenium(II) phosphine complexes, namely the absence of a solvent and the presence of small amounts of oxygen. It is interesting that the other trisubstituted silanes examined with different. substituent inductive effects, like trichloro- and triethylsilanes as well as dichloromethylsilane, do not give positive results in the 1-alkene and vinyW3ne hydrosilylztion reactions in the presence of RuC12('?Ph3)3 under various reaction conditions. The reason for unreactivity of chloro-substituted scenes seems to be migration of a chlorine atom from tte siiyl ligand to the ruthenium followed by splitting of the Si Ru bond as was shown for chlorosilyiruthenitim hydrides [2] . On the other hand the +I effect of alkyl s-abstituen*s at silicon, while decreasing the possibility of Ru-Si bond formation, accounts for the catalytic inactivity of ruthenium complexes in the hydrosi7ylation of the C=C bond by lsilanes [1]. When the reaction of trielaaogy- and tOethogysilanes with 1aegeae, hctene and triethox-yvinylsilane catalyzed by RuC12(PPh3)3 occurred i:_ benzene, hexane, acetonitrile and toluene, no adducts were observed. 125 To evaluate the mechanism pathways and to explain. Oe role of oxygen in the hydrosxlylation reaction under study, we have isolated the precipitated products of the reaction of RUCl2(PPh3)3 with triethosgsilane (0.5 h, temp. 100 9C, excess of Anne) which occurred without a solvent in air (A) and argon (B), respectively. This was followed by the determination of their reactivity (Table 1) and identification. The isolated pale colored complex A appeared to contain chlorine impurities (--1.0% wt.). In the IR spectrum a weak band due to Ru-H bond (near 1980 cm-') and a strong Si-Ii band at 2250 cm -1, assigned as the shifting of the band of the solvates trie-thogysiOe molecule to the complex, were observed. The spectrum also showed a broad band at 820 - 850 cm -1 attributable to Ru(02) vibration [4] and a weak band at 320 O-1 (Ru-Cl stretching). Oxygenation of phosphine to phosphine oxide in the presence of RuCl2(PPh3)3 carried out under oxidizing conditions should lead to the ruthenium phosphine oxide species (green colored complexes) [4 - 61 but ;his was not observed in our experiments in the presence of an excess of trialkosysilane. In the mass spectrum of the complex A neither molecular ion nor direct loss of PPh3 molecules were observed but in spite of this fact Ru-containing ions are readily identified by their characteristic pattern due to the isotopic distribution of naturally abundant ruthenium. A peak at m/z 297 (10Oo relative intensity) presumably originates from [Ru(02)Si(OC2HS)3] + species (sample temp. 100 C, chamber temp. 250 'C, ionizing voltage 75 V). The peak at m/z 429 of low intensity (1590) can correspond to the {RuH[Sn(OFi2H5)3] 2}~', which confirms the presence o the Ru-14: bond in the IR spectrum of A and suggests the following equrlibrimn is occurring under the preparation conditions: FiSi(OC2~ )3 Ru(02)S1[(OC2Hg)31 (PPh3)n IV-t1II[Si(OC2H5)3] -(PPh3)r. 02 The presence of the corresponding chlororut-henium complexes based on the results of chlorine determination, but undetectable by mass spectrometry, can not be ruled out in the case of A. Complementary magnetic measure ments of the complexes examined show that A consists of paramagnetic species characteristic for ruthhenium(FII) complexes. The complex B (white powder), is, on the contrary, diamagnetic (d6 sui_henium(H) complexes). Its O spectrum shows a very strong band assigned with the Ru-I-I bond (1980 cm-') and a very weak one at 2260 cEni originating from triethoxysrilane adsorbed on the solid complex. There are no bands at 820 - 850 cm-' and at 320 cm-1 (Ru-Cl), yet B conies traces of chlorine (0.2 - 0.5% wt.). These data confirm that complex B involves mostly the RuH[Si(OR)s1(PPh$)2, isolated by Kono but under different conditions [2] . The hydride-rufhenium(II) complex (B) can be partly converted into the dioxygen-ruthenium complex (A) and the reaction seems to be reversible under the conditions examined. When complex B was refluxed with triethogysilane in air (0.5 h), the product C was precipitated. It was found to be a mixture of A and B complexes. On the other hand, A reacts with triethoxysilane under oxygen-free conditions to give the diamagnetic product contain- 126 ing an Ru-I1 bond which is unreactive for hyOsilylation. The latter reaction leads to the formation of a stable Ru-H bond even in oxygen atmosphere when it is carried out in the presence of all the solvents mentioned. The catalytic data show that the diosygen-ruthenium complex A is an active intermediate of the hydrosilylation reaction (contrary to the hydridic ruthenium(Ij) complex R), but only when the reaction occurs in oxygen atmosphere. A study of the reaction of 1-hegene with the rutheniumhydrooen bond of complex S showed that olefin does not add to the Ru-H bond, which accounts for its negligible catalytic effect (Table 1). However, 1-hegene reacts with complex A under molecular oxygen to give a solid. The characteristic band originating from -0-0-stretching vibrations of complex A was not present in the IR spectrum of this product resulting presumably from the replacement of 02 with the olefin molecule. According to the general scheme of the hydrosrlylation mechanism of Chalk and Harrod [ 7] , the olefin coordination to such an intermediate ran lead to the formation of a ruthenium(III) complex, e.g. RuH[Si(OR)3] 2/ CH2=CHR'/(PPh3)2. The -latter is postulated to decompose rapidly, forming the hydrosilylation product and regenerating the active species. References 1 P. Sroboda, 8. ReRcha and J. Hettlejs, Coll. Czech. Chem.
