Developing a sustainable catalytic system for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass remains a vital and challenging process. In this context, the selective hydrogenation of the biomass-derived molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 5-methylfurfural (MF) with molecular hydrogen is one of the most important transformations but it is a difficult task because the C=O bond reduction in HMF is highly favorable than C−OH. This reaction finds applications in diverse sectors, including pharmaceuticals, and petrochemicals, etc. In this article, we report the use of manganese functionalized graphene oxide as heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of HMF to MF, utilizing H2 as a reducing agent. The synergistic effect between graphene oxide and MnOx are responsible for the activation of C−OH in the reaction. This work unlocks the potential of the earth abundant metal-based catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of renewable biomass to chemical feedstocks.

Introduction Selective catalytic hydrogenation is a class of chemical transformations of widespread importance in academia and industry, and selectivity is a crucial parameter in a chemical reaction [1]. Various reducible functionalities such as C=C, CC, C=O, C=N, –NO2, and aromatic rings are commonly found in compounds. Consequently, developing methods to selectively hydrogenate specific functional groups while leaving others intact is of great importance for synthesizing valuable chemicals and advancing chemical knowledge [2–4]. Furthermore, using biomass as raw materials to generate valuable compounds can reduce our dependence on fossil resources [5,6]. However, the complex nature of biomass and its derivatives poses challenges in controlling the selectivity of target product formation. Among the compounds derived from biomass, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform compound that can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, which is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, etc. [7–9]. Hydrogenation of HMF offers a promising route to produce a wide range of with high-value chemicals [10]. Previous studies have demonstrated the hydrogenation of HMF, resulting in various product compounds such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF) [11], 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) [12], 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) [13], 2,5-hexanediol (HDO)[14]. In addition, 5-methylfurfural (MF) is a beneficial chemical used as a food additive, anti-cancer natural product, pharmaceutical, and common organic synthesis intermediate [15–17]. Nevertheless, the selective hydrogenation of the C–OH functional group in HMF to MF has not yet been performed with non-noble metal catalysts using molecular hydrogen. Typically, the transformation of biomass into MF involves a multistep process. In this context, Hirota developed a process for preparing MF in high yield by reacting 2-methylfuran, phosgene, and NN-dimethylformamide and then hydrolyzing the reaction mixtures (Scheme 1 , Route 1) [18]. This route has drawbacks. It utilizes noble metal catalysts, and phosgene is a very toxic reagent, which makes it an environmentally unfriendly process. In addition, MF tends to further transform in to other chemicals via hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of the C=O bond, ring opening of the furan ring, and saturation of the furan ring under reductive conditions [19]. A series of other indirect methods have also been reported, such as the conversion of HMF to halogenated compounds such as 5-iodomethylfurfural, or 5-chloromethylfurfural, followed by further reduction to MF using a palladium-based catalyst via the hydro-dehalogenation route (Scheme 1, route 2 and 3) [20–22]. Nevertheless, the preparation of the catalyst and its stability are convoluted. However, the development of a suitable and noble metal-free catalytic system for the direct hydrogenation reaction of HMF using H2 as a reducing agent is of utmost significance. Recent advancements in the field have reported the hydrogenolysis of HMF to MF using direct route. For example, Li and co-workers achieved the selective hydrogenation of HMF to MF utilizing Pt anchored on Nb2O5 [23]. Another significant development came from the Nakajima and Hensen group, who disclosed a bimetallic Re-Ni-based catalyst capable of selective hydrogenation of HMF [24]. Despite this achievement, challenges such as energy-intensive separation, purification, and high-cost associated noble metal catalysts persist, hindering the direct conversion of HMF to MF using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent [25]. In this study, we investigate the potential of non-noble metals, such as Mn-based catalysts, for the selective hydrogenation of HMF to MF. Our aim is to unlock the potential of noble metal-free catalyst in the direct hydrogenation of biomass-derived materials to produce value-added products. Results and discussion Manganese-based catalysts have traditionally been employed for oxidation reactions and are seldom used in catalytic reduction reactions because of their limited ability to activate and dissociate molecular hydrogen [26]. In our study, we demonstrate that by doping the nanosize of manganese on graphene oxide (GO), the resulting materials can work as an effective catalyst for the conversion of HMF to MF. Typically, the catalyst material was synthesized by wet impregnation method using a 1:1 molar ratio of manganese precursor and 1,10-phenanthroline were deposited on GO, followed by pyrolysis under an argon atmosphere (Scheme S1) [27]. The obtained catalyst material was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, which revealed a distinctive reflectance at approximately 26°, indicative of the presence of the nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Figure S1) [28]. In contrast, Mn_N_Graphene exhibited no significant Mn reflection, suggesting a higher dispersion and the existence of MnOx nanoparticles with sizes below the detection limit of XRD [29]. These results highlight the crucial role of nitrogen atoms in graphene doping, serving as robust anchoring sites for MnOx NPs. This result is consistent with reported literature data showing that N-doped GO can effectively hold metal NPs and enhance homogenous dispersion [30–32]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to examine the catalyst structures (Figure S2a and S2b). Interestingly, no metallic Mn nanoparticles were observed on SEM and TEM, corroborating the XRD data (Figure S1). However, mapping images indicated a uniform distribution of Mn and N over the surface of graphene oxide (Fig. 1 a). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images revealed sub-nanoclusters. The HAADF- STEM image of Mn_N_Graphene exhibited Mn-rich nanoparticles in a white region compared to the graphene support. These MnOx nanoparticles were dispersed within GO layers and varied in size from 4 to 70 nm. Darkfield image TEM analysis (Fig. 1 b) and elemental analysis using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis in STEM mode confirmed the distribution of MnOx through the particles (Fig. 1 b and SI 3). Notably, the graphitic carbon shell typically observed in other catalysts prepared by thermal annealing of the molecular complex was absent in Mn_N_Graphene [33,34]. To gain further insight into the structure of the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed (Fig. 2 ). The C1s spectrum of the catalyst shows four main peaks with binding energies of 284.6, 285.8, 286.3, and 287.3 eV, corresponding to the C−C sp[2], C−C sp[3], C−O/C−N, and C=O or C=O−O, functionalities, respectively, indicating the presence of graphitic properties (Fig. 2). XPS analysis also revealed that nitrogen doping in the carbon lattice of GO is present as pyridine and quaternary ammonium groups [32]. Notably, the N1s spectra of Mn_N_Graphene displayed peaks at binding energies of 398.5, 400.8, and 402.8 eV, which are characteristic of pyridine and graphitic nitrogen species, contributing two electrons to the graphene framework [35]. The Mn 2p observed in the XPS spectra at binding energies of 642.5 (Mn 2p3/2) and 646.09 (Mn 2p1/2) confirmed the presence of manganese in the oxidation state of +4 (Fig. 2) [36,37]. This finding was further supported by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, which also detected the Mn presence of manganese in the catalyst (Table S1). In the O 1 s spectrum of the Mn_N_Graphene, three distinct peak components with binding energies of 534.5, 532.8, and 530.8 eV were observed, corresponding to C−O, C=O, and Mn−O species, respectively. Raman spectroscopy (Figure S4) showed a prominent G band around 1600 cm−1, indicating the presence of graphitic domains. The observed ID/IG increased to 1.61 in Mn_N_Graphene as compared to 1.30 in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Figure S4) because of the increased disorderliness of graphene sheets caused by the deposition of MnOx nanoparticles in Mn_N_Graphene, which may be due to the charge transfer from graphene to MnOx NPs [38–40]. Interestingly, the catalyst surface was found to be porous, as confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement (Figure S5). The BET-specific surface area of the prepared catalyst was 220 m2 g−1, which is advantageous for facilitating contact with substrate materials [29]. Additionally, we conducted similar measurements on other graphene-based materials such as GO and NrGO for comparative analysis (Table S2). To confirm the stability of Mn_N_Graphene, a comparative thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted, as shown in Figure S6. The thermogram of Mn_N_Graphene showed no significant weight loss at 400 °C, indicating its stability. In contrast, GO exhibited three major weight losses in its TG thermogram. The first weight loss occurred around 100 °C, which was attributed to H2O elimination, and the second weight loss, observed from 100 to 360 °C, was attributed to the decomposition of oxygenated surface groups. Finally, after 360 °C, oxidative pyrolysis of the carbon framework may occur [41]. The ability of the catalyst material to interact with molecular hydrogen was investigated. First, the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst was exposed to hydrogen at room temperature, and the weakly physisorbed hydrogen on the surface was removed by purging with argon for 20 min. Subsequently, the temperature increased. The hydrogen uptake value for the Mn_N_Graphene was found to be 0.038 mmol. g−1. The desorption profile (Figure S7) shows that the hydrogen was adsorbed on the catalyst and began to desorb until 400 °C, indicating the interaction of hydrogen with Mn_N_Graphene [42]. Next, the reactivity of Mn_N_Graphene in the selective hydrogenation of HMF was evaluated (Table 1 ). In the absence of a catalyst, almost no product formation was observed (Entry 1). However, when HMF in THF was subjected to hydrogenation (H2 10 bar) at 160 °C with Mn_N_Graphene (10 mg) as the catalyst >99% selectivity towards the complete conversion of HMF was achieved in 12 h (Entry 2), demonstrating the efficiency of Mn_N_Graphene as a catalyst. GC-MS analysis confirmed the formation of MF as the main reaction product (Figure S9–11), indicating the breaking C‒OH bond favored pathway under these reaction conditions. Interestingly, carbon materials such as GO and functionalized rGO were inactive (Entries 3–5). The results presented in the Table 1, specifically entries 8 and 9, indicate that longer reaction times enhances the hydrogenolysis of HMF to MF with high selectivity. This suggests that the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst efficiently promotes the selective conversion of HMF to MF, with extended reaction times positively impacting both the reaction rate selectivity. To gain insight in to the high selectivity of MF over Mn_N_Graphene in the HMF hydrogenation reaction, FT-IR spectroscopy was employed, using methanol and butanal as representative substrates. For instance, methanol contains the -OH group, while butanal contains the -C=O group. We conducted separate experiments by applying each adsorbent to the Mn_N_Graphene surface to discern which functional groups interacted with it. It was observed that the methanol undergoes transformation into methoxy species in the presence of Mn_N_Graphene. The band observed at 1155 cm−1 can be attributed to the (C‒O) bands (Fig. 3 ). These results show that the chemical adsorption of C‒OH occurred over the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst, whereas Mn_N_Graphene does not adsorb the C=O functional group. The FT-IR results suggests that the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst may selectively activate the C‒OH bond in the HMF hydrogenation reaction [23]. To further confirm this statement, we performed the hydrogenation reaction of MF using the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions (Table S3, Entry 2). MF could not be hydrogenated over Mn_N_Graphene, indicating that it is not active for the hydrogenation reaction of C=O, which is the main reason for the high selectivity of MF. The Mn_N_Graphene heterogeneity and leaching were assessed by removing the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst after 3 h of the reaction time, and the reaction was continued for 12 h without the catalyst. The product yield was found to be 67% (Fig. 4 a), indicating that a very limited catalyst active species leaching occurred in the mixture. The main advantage of heterogeneous catalysis is its easy recovery and recyclability. Hence, the reusability of the Mn_N_Graphene was investigated (Fig. 4 b), and the hydrogenated product MF was in excellent selectivity. Although, the product yield of the MF slightly decreased from cycle 1 to cycle 4, this could be attributed to the loss of the catalyst during the recycling process. This result suggests that the developed Mn-based catalyst is highly robust and doesn't undergo deactivation during catalysis. The catalyst used was analyzed using XPS (Figure S13), and it was found that the binding energy of Mn 2p for the fresh and recycled catalyst was nearly the same as that of the original Mn_N_Graphene, indicating that there was no significant change in the electronic state of Mn. Furthermore, the selectivity of different substrates with -CHO and -OH functional groups over Mn_N_Graphene was studied, as shown in Table S3. The reactivity of furfuryl alcohol was checked, and it was found that the Mn_N_Graphene was inactive for the conversion of 5-methyl furfural to 5-methyl furfuryl alcohol, while active for the hydrogenolysis of the furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran (56%) (Table S3, Entry 3). The Mn_N_Graphene catalyst showed promising performance for the selective hydrogenation of HMF, however, it was found to be inactive for the conversion of aliphatic -OH groups, as indicated in Table S3, Entry 5. These findings confirm that Mn_N_Graphene plays an important role in the catalytic conversion of biomass derivatives. In comparison to previously reported catalysts employing noble metals, such as Pd-doped mesoporous carbon[43], and N-doped carbon layer coated Au[44], (Table S4), the performance of Mn_N_Graphene emerges as either comparable or notably superior in some cases. The enhanced performance of the investigated can be attributed to its unique properties, such as its specific composition, structure, and surface characteristics, which implies the presence of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst [40]. These properties likely contribute to improved interaction with the reactants and more efficient conversion processes. Moreover, the presence of Mn_N_Graphene could lead to enhanced catalytic sites, allowing for more favorable reaction pathways. Experimental Materials and method Mn(acac)3 (99.9%), ethanol (A. R. grade), and 1,10-phenanthroline were obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (research grade), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, hydrochloric acid and tetrahydrofuran, potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. Graphite flake was obtained from Bay Carbon Inc. All chemicals were used without further purification. The surface functional groups of the catalyst were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR 4100, JASCO). The sample (15 mg) of the Mn_N_Graphene catalyst was dispersed in a butanal or methanol solution of THF at 160 °C and stirred for 12 h. The suspension was filtered and washed using THF to remove the physically absorbed species, dried at 70 °C overnight, and characterized by ATR-IR. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected using PHI 1600 system (PerkinElmer) with monochromatic an Al Kα X-ray source (1487 eV) and a nominal spot size 400 micrometer diameter. The sample was subjected to a survey spectrum with energy resolution (pass energy 50 eV) spectra, which were recorded for the C1s, O1s, N1s, and Mn 2p regions. Peak fitting was performed on these regions using a Lorentzian/Gauss mix of 30%. The morphology of the materials was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU-8000, Hitachi), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM-2100F, JEOL). The crystallinity and the graphitic layer of the catalyst materials were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, RINT2100, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation sources in the range of 5–60°. A Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm excitation light (NRS-3100, JASCO) was used to study the structure of the catalyst. A thermogravimetric analyzer (TG/DTA6200, SII NanoTechnology Inc., Japan) was used to determine the thermal stability of the catalysts (amount 2 mg) with temperatures ranging from 30 to 600 °C, while 10 °C/min, in nitrogen atmosphere. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by adsorption-desorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature using microtarc Tristar 3000 equipment. Sample degassing was performed at 300 °C before obtaining the adsorption isotherm. Temperature-programmed reduction plots were recorded on a Microtrac catalyst analyzer BELCAT II, heated until 800 °C at rate of 5 °C/min, with a total flow of 30 mL/min (H2: 3 mL while Ar as a carrier gas: 27 mL/min). The reactions were all performed in a 15 mL steel-based autoclave and monitored by GC-MS (QP2010 SE) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Synthesis of the support material graphene oxide (GO) GO was prepared using a modified Tour's method [45]. In brief, concentrated H2SO4/H3PO4 (360:40 mL) was added to a mixture of graphite flakes (3.0 g) and KMnO4 (18.0 g), generating a slight exotherm to 35 °C. The mixture was then heated to 50 °C under stirring for 12 h, cooled to room temperature, and poured onto ice (400 mL), followed by 30% H2O2 (3 mL). The solid products were then recovered by centrifugation and washed several times with HCl (5%) and water. They were dispersed in distilled water and ultrasonicated for 5 h to produce GO nanosheets by exfoliation. The obtained GO nanosheets were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and then redispersed in distilled water for further use. Preparation of the catalyst The Mn_N_Graphene catalyst for the HMF hydrogenolysis reaction was prepared based on the reported procedure [37]. Typically, in a 100 mL round bottom flask Mn(acac)3 (0.5 mmol) and ligand ((1,10-phenanthroline) 0.5 mmol) were solubilized in ethanol (30 mL) followed by sonication for 2 h to generate the Mn-phenanthroline complex. In the other beaker, GO (560 mg) was taken in ethanol (70 mL) and sonicated for 3 h. The Mn-phenanthroline complex and GO suspension were mixed in a 350 mL beaker and sonicated for 3 h, followed by refluxing at 85 °C for 4 h. The mixture was cooled down, and ethanol was evaporated by a rotary evaporator. The solid product was dried overnight at 80 °C, ground to powder, then followed by calcination at 900 °C in a ramp of 25 °C.min−1 for 4 h in an argon atmosphere (50 mL.min−1) to obtain Mn_N_Graphene. The synthesis procedure of Mn_Graphene is similar to that of Mn_N_Graphene, but without the addition of nitrogen precursor. In the case of NrGO, a manganese precursor was not added and the rest of the procedure was similar to that of Mn_N_Graphene. Hydrogenolysis of HMF to MF The hydrogenation experiment was performed in a 15 mL steel-based autoclave. In a typical experiment, a known amount of HMF as a reactant, catalyst (10 mg), and solvent (THF 2 mL) (otherwise stated) were loaded into the reactor, sealed, degassed, purged with hydrogen, and heated at a specified temperature. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was filtered, and the product was identified by GC-MS (QP2010 SE) and quantitatively determined by GC-FID. The sample concentration was measured by the standard internal method, using n-decane as the internal standard, while utilizing the HP-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm in diameter, 30 m in length). The oven temperature started at 50 °C and rose to 280 °C at 20 °C. min−1, and the carrier gas was helium. The catalyst was recovered by simple filtration, then washed with ethyl acetate and water, and dried. Conclusion In summary, a Mn nanoparticle-based heterogeneous catalytic system for the selective hydrogenation reaction of HMF has been developed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on Mn nanoparticles for the selective hydrogenolysis of HMF in the presence of H2 under mild and benign conditions. In addition, the catalyst can be recycled without any decrease in selectivity. We believe that the protocol for combining the active earth-abundant metal and biocompatible graphene support can also be used for catalyzing other challenging selective hydrogenation reactions in biomass conversion.

        "dc:description": "Developing a sustainable catalytic system for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass remains a vital and challenging process. In this context, the selective hydrogenation of the biomass-derived molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 5-methylfurfural (MF) with molecular hydrogen is one of the most important transformations but it is a difficult task because the C=O bond reduction in HMF is highly favorable than C−OH. This reaction finds applications in diverse sectors, including pharmaceuticals, and petrochemicals, etc. In this article, we report the use of manganese functionalized graphene oxide as heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of HMF to MF, utilizing H2 as a reducing agent. The synergistic effect between graphene oxide and MnOx are responsible for the activation of C−OH in the reaction. This work unlocks the potential of the earth abundant metal-based catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of renewable biomass to chemical feedstocks.",
