Graphical abstract Synthesis of diphenyl carbonate (DPC) from phenol and CO2 has been explored in CCl4 with zinc halides as catalyst. DPC yield and selectivity are influenced by the catalyst usage, reaction temperature, CO2 pressure and initial composition of reactants.

Synthesis of diphenyl carbonate (DPC) from phenol and CO2 has been explored in CCl4 with zinc halides as catalyst. DPC yield and selectivity are influenced by the catalyst usage, reaction temperature, CO2 pressure and initial composition of reactants. The main byproduct is phenyl salicylate (PS). Zinc halides as Lewis acid exhibit high catalytic activity for DPC synthesis; ZnCl2 gives higher DPC yield and selectivity than ZnBr2 and ZnI2. High DPC yield was obtained with ZnCl2 as catalyst at 120°C and 4.0MPa. Based on the experimental observation, a possible reaction scheme has been proposed. The electronegativity of halogen ligand may determine the formation of DPC and PS; the Cl ligand in ZnCl2 with strong electronegativity may favor the formation of DPC. Keywords Synthesis Diphenyl carbonate Phenol Carbon dioxide Carbon tetrachloride Zinc chloride 1 Introduction Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is a key raw material for producing aromatic polycarbonates. It is still mainly synthesized by using severely toxic phosgene as a raw material. The phosgene route is definitely to be replaced by the environmentally benign routes due to the worldwide awareness of pollution hazards of phosgene [1]. At present, the main nonphosgene routes include the oxidative carbonylation of phenol [2–7] and transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with phenol [8–11]. Although the raw materials are easily available for the oxidative carbonylation of phenol, its commercialization is hampered by the low DPC yield, use of noble metal catalysts and costly procedures [7]. Transesterification suffers from low DPC yield and selectivity even at a elevated temperature, because this two-step process is thermodynamically limited [11]. The transesterification of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) with phenol catalyzed by homogeneous [12,13] and heterogeneous [14,15] catalysts is another approach to DPC synthesis; however, the attainable DPC yield in such a multistage process is still much lower than expectations. It will be undoubtedly attractive if DPC can be synthesized directly from phenol and CO2 [16], because CO2 is abundant and environmentally benign. However, the direct synthesis of DPC from phenol and CO2 proved to be difficult due to the inertness of CO2. Phenyl carbonate (PhOCOO−) [17] could be produced from the reaction of CO2 with phenoxide, and CCl3 + could be formed from the decomposition of CCl4 over Lewis acid catalysts [18,19]. It was then supposed that trichloromethyl phenyl carbonate can be formed from CO2 and phenoxide in CCl4 in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts, and DPC can be then obtained through transesterification of trichloromethyl phenyl carbonate with phenoxide. On this view, direct synthesis of DPC from phenoxide, CO2 and CCl4 in one pot was realized with ZnCl2 as catalyst [20]. In this work, the synthesis of DPC from phenol and CO2 was investigated in CCl4 with zinc halides as catalyst. The effects of catalyst usage, reaction temperature, CO2 pressure and initial composition of reactants on the DPC yield and selectivity were then examined. Based on the experimental observation, possible reaction scheme was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reaction procedures Standard samples DPC and phenyl salicylate (PS) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.; phenol, CCl4, and K2CO3 were obtained from Tianjin Tian-Da Chemical Corporation. Liquid CCl4 was freshly distilled before use. CO2 (99.95%) from Beijing Analytical Instrument Co. was used without further treatment. Anhydrous ZnCl2, ZnBr2 and ZnI2 were obtained from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co. and were dehydrated before use [21]. All reactions were carried out in an autoclave of 250mL that was flame-dried prior to use. Phenol, CCl4, K2CO3 and zinc halides were first placed in the autoclave, and then the autoclave was sealed and flushed with CO2 to wash out air in it. Then it was pressurized to a certain pressure with CO2 and heated to the reaction temperature. After the reaction lasted for a given time, the vessel was cooled down to room temperature and the resultants were then taken out and subjected to analysis. A small amount of cetane was added to the reaction mixture as an internal standard to perform GC analysis. The products were identified by using GC–MS (HP 5972) by comparison with the authentic samples. Quantitative analysis was carried on a GC (Shimadzu GC-14B) with an FID and a DB-1 capillary column (60m×0.25mm×0.25μm). DPC selectivity and yield were obtained on the basis of phenol conversion. 2.2 Phase equilibrium measurements The phase changes of the reaction mixture were measured with a high-pressure view cell (15.00mL) as described in the reference [22]. The pre-evacuated cell was first charged with a known mass of liquid mixture (phenol+CCl4), and then it was pressurized with CO2 and heated to the desired temperature (120°C). The content in the cell was maintained at this temperature for 2h to reach a phase equilibrium. Generally, both liquid and vapor phases were formed in the cell, and their volumes can be estimated by a scale on the view cell. Then, both the gas and liquid phases were sampled and their compositions were determined through GC analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Selection of catalysts The effects of various zinc halides (ZnX2, X=Cl, Br and I) on the DPC synthesis are summarized in Table 1 . The main products are DPC and PS in all cases. Zinc halides as Lewis acid exhibit certain catalytic activity for DPC synthesis; ZnCl2 gives higher DPC yield and selectivity than ZnBr2 and ZnI2. With ZnCl2 as catalyst, the DPC yield and selectivity reached 19.1% and 80.2%, respectively; however, the DPC yield was much lower with ZnBr2 or ZnI2 as catalyst. Moreover, iodine substituted phenol was formed with ZnI2 as catalyst. The catalytic activity of zinc halides may be related to the electronegativity of halogen ligands. ZnCl2 is a well known Lewis acid catalyst. It facilitates the dissociation of CCl4 molecule into CCl3 + [18,19], which promotes the formation of intermediate trichloromethyl phenyl carbonate and thereafter DPC. Cl in ZnCl2 with high electronegativity may favor the formation of stable CCl3 + and reaction intermediates; however, ZnBr2 and ZnI2 exhibit lower catalytic activity due to the low electronegativity of Br and I ligands. Moreover, ZnBr2 and ZnI2 are also less stable than ZnCl2 under the reaction conditions. 3.2 Effects of CO2 pressure on the reaction behavior Through the visual observation, it was proved that the reaction mixture is separated to liquid and gas phases under the reaction conditions. At low pressure, CO2 concentration in the liquid phase is very low, while the main content in the gas phase is CO2. The compositions in both the gas and liquid phases change with the increase in CO2 pressure, as shown in Fig. 1 . With the increase in CO2 pressure from 0.1 to 4.0MPa, the CO2 content in the liquid phase increased from 0.05 to 1.96mol/L; the CCl4 content in the gas phase increased from 0.01 to 0.84mol/L. Because the amount of CO2 dissolved in liquid CCl4 is larger than the amount of CCl4 released in gaseous CO2, the volume of liquid phase increases substantially with the pressure. The phenol concentration in the liquid phase is kept at a stable level (0.60–0.79mol/L), although it varies slightly with the pressure due to the change in the liquid volume and its amount released to the gas phase. Because the reaction takes place mainly in the liquid phase, CO2 pressure influences the reaction behavior significantly due to the change in the concentration of the reactants. As shown in Fig. 2 , DPC is hardly obtained without charging CO2 in the system except a certain amount of CO2 that may be formed from the reaction of K2CO3 with phenol. Phenol conversion increases with the pressure due to the increase in CO2 concentration. At 0.1MPa, DPC yield and selectivity are 9.9% and 84.2%, respectively. However, DPC selectivity decreases with increasing CO2 pressure from 0.1 to 3.0MPa, exhibits a minimum at 3.0MPa, and then increases again with the pressure; PS selectivity exhibits a maximum at 3.0MPa. It is difficult to explain this phenomenon. Perhaps PS formation is more sensitive to the concentration of CO2 in CCl4. DPC selectivity is enhanced again at a pressure higher than 3.0MPa; this is possibly accounted for by assuming that the properties of dense reaction mixture at high pressure may be in some way similar to those of supercritical fluid, which alters the reaction pathways. 3.3 Effects of phenol concentration on the reaction behavior Phenol concentration in CCl4 also exhibits significant influences on the reaction behavior. As shown in Fig. 3 , with the increase in the quantity of phenol added to the autoclave, DPC selectivity decreases and PS selectivity increases significantly. It seems that high phenol concentration favors the formation of PS. 3.4 Effects of K2CO3 quantity on the reaction behavior The effects of K2CO3 quantity added to the autoclave on the reaction are shown in Fig. 4 . DPC selectivity decreases significantly with the increase in the K2CO3 quantity, while PS selectivity increases accordingly. This indicates that high concentration of K2CO3 (it means stronger alkalinity) facilitates the PS formation. DPC yield reaches a maximum of 13.2% with 15mmol K2CO3 added to the reactor, which is corresponding to a K2CO3/phenol mole ratio of 0.5. 3.5 Effects of water quantity on the reaction behavior The effects of water quantity added to the autoclave in DPC synthesis are shown in Fig. 5 . DPC selectivity decreases from 99.5% to 73.0% with increasing water quantity added from 0 to 5.0mL, while DPC yield reaches a maximum of 22.4% when 1.0mL water is blended with 40mL CCl4. The decline in DPC selectivity may be due to the hydrolysis of DPC in the presence of water. However, proper amounts of water could enhance the dissolution of ZnCl2 in the reacting mixture, which may promote the reaction. This suggests that DPC synthesis under current conditions is tolerant of certain amounts of water in the reaction system. 3.6 Effects of reaction temperature on the reaction behavior As illustrated in Fig. 6 , DPC selectivity decreases from 98.5% to 75.7% with the increase in temperature from 90 to 190°C. Below 90°C, DPC yield is very low; it increases with elevating temperature from 90 to 120°C. DPC yield hardly changes with further increasing temperature. Therefore, a temperature of 120°C is appropriate for the DPC synthesis. 3.7 Effects of reaction time on the reaction behavior The effects of reaction time on the DPC synthesis are depicted in Fig. 7 . DPC selectivity is kept at a stable level for first 6h, and then it decreased with the reaction time. In another way, DPC yield increases to 15.6% at 6h and reached a maximum of 22.2% at 12h. This suggests that a reaction time of 6–12h is appropriate for the DPC synthesis. 3.8 Possible reaction scheme Although the complicated characterizations are necessary to draw a detailed reaction mechanism for DPC synthesis under current conditions, a rough reaction path is suggested in Scheme 1 . In this reaction scheme, potassium phenoxide reacts with CO2, and potassium phenyl carbonate and potassium salicylate are then formed [17]. With the action of Lewis acid catalyst ZnCl2, CCl3 + is formed from CCl4 decomposition. Then potassium phenyl carbonate interacts with CCl3 + to form the intermediate trichloromethyl phenyl carbonate (PhOCOOCCl3), which further reacts with another potassium phenoxide to form DPC and phosgene-like intermediate through a transesterification process. Potassium phenyl carbonate and potassium salicylate can be rearranged to each other with the action of ZnCl2 catalyst. PS is thus formed in a similar way. The phosgene-like intermediate would further react with potassium phenoxide to form DPC and PS. The rate-determining step should be the reaction of PhOCOO− with CCl3 + to form the intermediate PhOCOOCCl3, which made the carbonyl easily attached by phenoxide. The Cl ligand in ZnCl2 with strong electronegativity is helpful in forming stable CCl3 +, and then favor the formation of DPC. 4 Conclusions DPC can be synthesized from phenol and CO2 in CCl4 with zinc halides as catalyst. Its yield and selectivity are influenced by the catalyst usage, reaction temperature, CO2 pressure and initial composition of reactants. The main byproduct is PS. Zinc halides as Lewis acid exhibit high catalytic activity for DPC synthesis; ZnCl2 gives higher DPC yield and selectivity than ZnBr2 and ZnI2. High DPC yield is obtained with ZnCl2 as catalyst at 120°C and 4.0MPa. DPC may form via the intermediate trichloromethyl phenyl carbonate PhOCOOCCl3 that is produced from the interaction of PhOCOO− with CCl3 +. The electronegativity of the halogen ligand in zinc halides may determine their activity for the formation of DPC and PS. The Cl ligand in ZnCl2 with strong electronegativity is helpful in forming stable CCl3 +, and thus favors the formation of DPC.
