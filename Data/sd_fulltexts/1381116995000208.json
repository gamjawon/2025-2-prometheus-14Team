FeTM4PyP5+ 1 as homogeneous catalyst for cyclohexane hydroxylation, in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and ultrasound stirring, gives cyclohexanol (C-ol) yields of 20%. The FeTM2PyP5+ 2 as catalyst for cyclohexene oxidation in CH3CN and ultrasound stirring is a very efficient system, giving 93% of total yield, with an epoxide:alcohol:ketone selectivity of 77:12:11. The supported systems, 1-IPG and 1-SG are particularly efficient in dichloromethane (CH2C1z), giving C-of yields of 37% and 53%, respectively. These systems consist of polar hemin in isolated sites, which selectively catalyze cyclohexane oxidation in apolar solvent. They represent good cytochrome P-450 model systems. In the same way, the active site of P-450 consists of a polar protohemin in a hydrophobic pocket, promoting selective cyclohexane oxidation. These rigid cationic 1-IPG, 1-SG, 2rIPG, 2-SG, 3-IPG and 3-SG systems can catalyze with very small amounts of ironporphyrins, which correspond to about 30-80 times fewer numbers than the hemin in P-450 catalytic site.

Introduction Metalloporphyrins, specially iron and manganese complexes, are capable of oxygenating hydrocarbons in a catalytic way, yielding alcohol from alkane and epoxide from olefin under mild conditions [ 1 ] . Metalloporphyrins with bulky and electronegative substituents have been prepared in order to prevent the g,-oxo dimer formation and * Corresponding author. Fax.

The combination of electron-withdrawing substituents in the metalloporphyrins with immobilization on inorganic supports results in very efficient, selective and easy to recover catalysts [ 5,6 ] . The siteisolation on a solid support prevents porphyrin oxidative degradation by bimolecular interaction [ 7 ] . These systems are potentially useful for selective oxidation inorganic chemistry [ 1 ] and for the prediction of the oxidative metabolism of drugs or xenobiotics [ 8 ] 188 Y. lamamoto et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 99 (1995)187-193 R \\ / R ~H i i R Ironporphyrin 7 Fe7MIPyP(CIO4)6 R=-~/ \"H=CH3 CH 3 2 Fe7LUPYPC~ R=~ 3 FPPCI R= H=e F*TM2PyPC6 R= Fig. 1. Structures of the ironporphyrins. Mansuy et al. [ 1,8 ] have reported charged manganese porphyrin adsorbed on silica as a specially efficient catalyst for alkane hydroxylation. Almost the same results were obtained when this catalyst was supported on montmorillonite clay [ 9 ] . It has also been shown that iron phthalocyanine encapsulated inside zeolites shows selectivity towards smaller substrates and regioselectivity for linear alkane hydroxylation [ 10] . The study of intermediates has arisen from the reaction between cationic methylpyridyl substituted iron porphyrins and iodosylbenzene, in methanol-dichloromethane systems, have been previously reported by us [ 11 ] . The results explained the low catalytic efficiency of cyclohexane hydroxylation in methanol containing systems, despite the fact that this solvent favors the ferryl radical, FeIv (O) P+ ' , species [ 12,13 ] . In this work we are reporting cationic orthoand para-alkylpyridyl substituted iron porphyrins as catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation (Fig. 1) in homogeneous systems or supported on IPG (FeP5+-IPG) and silica gel (FePS+-SG) systems, using iodosylarene as oxygen donor. Methanol effects in hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions will be discussed. The electronic effect of ortho- andpara-alkylpyridyl substituents are evident in the homogeneous oxidation reac- tions studied. The strong interactions, catalystIPG and catalyst-SG, by coordination and/or adsorption promotes stable and particularly efficient supported systems in some particular solvent conditions, when compared to the corresponding homogeneous systems. 2. Experimental section 2.1. Materials All the materials were of commercial reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Methanol, dichloromethane, acetonitrile and toluene were only distilled. NN-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was stirred over KOH at room temperature overnight, decanted, then distilled at reduced pressure. All solvents were stored over activated 3 or 4 molecular sieves under argon atmosphere. Iodosylbenzene (PhIO) and iodosyltoluene (CH3PhI0) were prepared by the hydrolysis of iodoarene diacetate with aqueous sodium hydroxide following Sharefkin and Saltzman's method [ 14] . Iodosylarene samples were stored in freezer and replaced every six months. The purity was controlled by iodometric assay. 2.1.1. Porphyrins and iron porphyrins Meso-tetrakis (4-N-methylpyridyl) porphyrin iron (III) pentaperchlorate (FeTM4PyP (CI04) s 1 and meso-tetrakis(tetraphenyl)porphyrin iron(III) chloride FeTPPCI 3 were purchased from Midcentury. The corresponding ortho isomer FeTM2PyP(C104)5 2 and the mesotetrakis (tetradecyl-2-pyridyl) porphyrin iron (111) chloride (FeTTD2PyP) Cls 4, an atropisomer mixture ( aa(8(3, a, were obtained according to procedure described previously [ 15 ] . 2.1.2. Imidazolyl propyl gel The support was prepared using the procedure presented in the literature [ 16,17 ] . 19 g of imidazole and 45 ml of 3-chloropropyl trimethoxysilane were refluxed at 100 for 15 h in toluene. 170 g of silica gel (Merck 60 A, 0.063-0.2 mm Y. lamamoto et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 99 (1995,) 187-193 70-230 mesh) was added to this solution, which was refluxed for more 8 h. At the end of the reaction, the functionalized silica was washed with toluene, ethanol and dried in vacuum at 80-100. Elemental analysis: C = 5.34%; H =1.20%; N = 0.65%. 2.1.3. Preparation of supported ironporphyrins About 5 X 10 - 6 to 1.5 X 10 -' mol of FePS + were dissolved in 5 ml of methanol and added to 0.50 g of IPG or silica gel. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The supported solid was separated by filtration from the solvent and washed three times with about 3 ml of methanol. The amount of supported FeP5 + was determined by spectrophotometry, through the absorption intensity of the Soret band in the remaining methanol filtrate and washings solution. The supported solid was dried under vacuum at room temperature. The catalysts were characterized by UV-Vis spectra. FeP5+-IPG (brownish), through the typical FeP-Im spectra with absorption at 552 nm [ 18 ] , and FeP5 +-SG (greenish) through the absorption at 580 nm in FeP-OH species [ 19] . 2.2. Oxidation reactions The reactions were carried out in a 2 ml vial with an open top screw cap containing a silicone Teflon faced septum. 2.2.1. Solution catalysis To the vial containing the ironporphyrin (3.0 X 10-' mol) and CHYMO or PhIO (3.0 X LO-6 mol) under argon atmosphere and in an adapted dark chamber, 100 A1 of substrate (cyclohexane or cyclohexene) and 200 Al of the desired solvent were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 with ultrasound (ultrasound laboratory cleaner Minison-Thornton, 40 W, 5060 Hz). After the desired time, sodium bisulfitesaturated methanol or acetonitrile solution (20 Al) was added to the reaction mixture in order to quench further oxidation, and the vial was then removed from the ultrasound bath. 189 2.2.2. Supported catalysis To the vial containing 9.0 X 10-' to 1.2 X 10' mol of PhIO and 0,1000 g of the solid catalyst under argon atmosphere, 300 Al of dichloromethane and 200 Al of cyclohexane were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for the specified time, in the absence of light. The product was extracted with 200 Al aliquots of solvent, followed by 5 min stirring, until 2 ml of extract was obtained. For the recycling experiments, the catalyst was washed 10 times with solvent. This procedure was done to ensure that the remaining iodosylbenzene was totally removed from the catalyst. This catalyst was then dried for 3 h at 60, before the next recycling. 2.2.3. Product analysis Gas chromatographic analysis were performed on a CG 500 gas chromatograph coupled to a CG300 integrator. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with an hydrogen flame ionization detector. The Inox column (length 1.8 m, internal diameter 3 mm) was packed with 10% Carbowax 20M on chromosorb WHP. The products formed were analysed by comparison of their retention times with authentic samples. Yields were determined from a standard curve and using n-octanol as internal standard. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Homogeneous catalysis 3.1.1. Cyclohexane as substrate The catalytic activity is obviously limited by the ironporphyrin solubility in the selected solvent. Yields of cyclohexanol are higher in the solvents where FeP5+ or FeP+ are soluble (Table 1) : FeTPPCI 3 in dichloromethane, FeTM4PyP(C104)5 1 in acetonitrile and (FeTTD2PyP)C15 4, with amphiphilic character, in dichloromethane and acetonitrile [ 15 ] .

There are two competitive reactions which contribute to deactivation: (i) conversion of Fe\" (O)P+' to the Fe,01N species [11,12]; (ii) Fe\" (O)P+' is readily reduced to the PFeIvPOH by one electron by hydrogen abstraction from methanol and the latter is oxidized to formaldehyde [ 11,20,21 ] . In acetonitrile FeTM2PyPC15 2 presents low activity, despite its good solubility. The orthomethyl groups present some steric protection and the positive charges on the ortho-methylpyridyl nitrogens act by withdrawing electrons from the porphyrin ring, making the stabilization of the active ferryl-cationic species difficult if compared to the corresponding para-substituent 1 [ 15,22] . The best catalytic activity was attained with 4 (Table 1) , an atropisomer mixture (aa813, a6a/6) with ortho-tetradecyl long chain groups and amphiphilic character in homogeneous dich- loromethane system, despite the presence of positive charges on the ortho-substituents. The long alkyl chains can be oriented towards the solvent and the faces are symmetrically protected, however there is an easy access for PhIO and substrate [15]. Ultrasound effect: Our group has optimized homogeneous catalysis using FeP+ and Fees+, attaining good results with ultrasound stirring [ 15,23,24] . The yields and selectivities towards cyclohexanol were better with ultrasound stirring for 1, when compared to magnetic stirring (Table 1), indicating that the hydrogen abstraction process is favored. Ultrasound promotes more effective mixture and homogenization of the reactants, favoring the reaction. 3.1.2. Cyclohexene as substrate Solvent effect. It was discussed in the hydroxylation reactions section that, while on the one hand methanol can act favoring active species formation, on the other hand, competitive reactions lead to deactivation and low yields. However, the cyclohexene epoxidation in catalytic systems containing methanol are very efficient (Table 2) . It was reported by Traylor et al. [25,26] that the epoxidation mechanism occurs via a carbocation Table 2 Oxidation of cyclohexene with CH3PhI0 in different solvents, using ironporphyrins as the catalyst in homogeneous systems Ironporphyrin Solvent Yield a, % Epoxide Alcohol Ketone Total 1 FeTM4PyP(C104)5 CH3CN CH30H/ CH2C12 2 FeTM2PyP(C104)5 CH3CN 3 FeTPPCl 48 58 72 CH3CN 54 CH30H/ 50 CH2C12 CHZC12 CH2C12 n 47 55 10 14 9 20 11 17 7 24 15 72 97 10 93 24 95 16 73 26 97 0 70 Conditions: [FeP] =10-' mold-'; [CH3PhI0] =10-' moll-'; 0; stirring for 30 min by ultrasound, under argon atmosphere. a Error average of 2%, based on the starting CH3PhI0.

The polar solvent increases electron transfer rates. This is explained by the better solvation of the alkene radical cation than of the porphyrin radical cation. In methanol containing cyclohexene reactions (Table 2), cyclohexenol yields were relatively lower, probably due to competitive reactions as we have seen before for hydroxylation reactions. Distribution of products. Traylor and Miksztal [ 27 ] proposed two possible competitive mechanisms in order to determine the distribution of the products: (i) Electron-transfer epoxidation (Scheme 1 a) , which is favored with electronegative iron (I1I)porphyrin. The results for cationic polar ironporphyrin show selectivity towards epoxidation like the more electronegative FeP+. This tendency is more pronounced for ortho-methylpyridyl substituted FePs+ 2, having acetonitrile as solvent (Table 2) . Gunter and Turner [ 28 ] explain selectivity towards epoxides when there are meso-ortho-substituents in the FeP through a transient valence isomerization of the intermediates: O=Fe'vP+' (Type 2) - O=FevP (Type 1) . Type 1 would enhance epoxide formation. (ii) Direct hydrogen atom abstraction, leading to cyclohexenyl radical resulting in allylic alcohol formation (Scheme 2) . Our results using FePS + and FeP+ as catalysts in cyclohexene oxidation always show additional yields of cyclohexenol (Table 2) if compared to the literature results [27,29]. The allylic hydroxylation process probably is favored by ultrasound, as we have discussed for hydroxylation. The catalytic results presented in this work are more efficient particularly for FeTPPCI. However, they are less selective if compared with those 191 obtained by Groves [ 26 ] (Table 2) in cyclohex ene oxidation. Besides allylic alcohol formation, there is additional cyclohexenone formation. With polar FeP5+ cyclohexenone yield was also increased (Table 2) . The ultrasound effect prob ably favors this loss of selectivity through a radical formation process. The cyclohexenyl radical, formed rapidly via a single electron-transfer mechanism and proton loss [ 27 ] , (Scheme lb) can be oxidized by the Fe'v(O)P+', affording cyclohexenone. Fontecave and Mansuy [ 30] sug gested that cyclohexyl radical reacts with Mn (V) =O for MnP in the cyclohexane oxidation to cyclohexanone. Cyclohexenone as product in cyclohexene oxidation was almost absent for FeP+ [27,29], the yield becoming higher for more electropositive catalysts, FeP+ < MnP+ < CrP+ [ 27 ] . In this way, ultra sound is promoting ketone formation almost like the electropositive metalloporphyrins. 3.2. Supported catalysis Supported ironporphyrins as catalysts in the cyclohexane hydroxylation present the same selectivity towards cyclohexanol and are more efficient than homogeneous systems (Table 1 and Table 3) . Besides the efficiency, selectivity and resistance of the FeP+ to oxidative degradation mentioned before for supported systems, there are additional advantages for polar FeP5 + . The optimum reaction conditions with the best yields for cationic Fees+-IPG and Fees+-SG systems are shown in Table 3. They are the result of an efficient system because a very low amount of FePS + (1.0 X 10-' mol per gram of solid support) is used, and it is about ten times less than that used for the FeP+ systems (1.0 X 10-6 mol per gram of solid support) [6]. The steric hindrance of methyl-2-pyridyl and tetradecyl-2-pyridyl meso-substituent in the porphyrin ring in 2 and 4 respectively leads to a H H O-Fe H H I.

FeP-IPG systems The catalytic activity of these polar FeP` in homogeneous system are limited by solubility, so FeTM4PyP5 + 1 is inefficient in dichloromethane, yielding 1 % (Table 1) . However, with 1-IPG, the yield is increased to 37% in the same solvent, higher than 22% for (FeTPP) +-IPG (Table 3) . 3.2.2. FeP-SG systems Surprisingly, l-SG showed the best efficiency, 53% for cyclohexane hydroxylation, in contrast to that presented by (FeTPP)+-SG (Table 3), which was only 5%. We have recently reported lower cyclohexanol yield, for (FeTDCPP) +-SG and (FeTFPP) +-SG 15 and 18% respectively [6]. The cationic FeTM4PyP5+ is rigidly supported through the adsorption of peripheral positively charged 4-methyl pyridynium groups on silica gel OH groups and coordination of central iron(III) site to the same kind of silica gel OH group. In this way, in the cationic FeP5 --SG, the porphyrin ring is more planar and the active site is more regularly exposed than in FeP+SG. 3.2.3. Recycling studies The advantage of the immobilized systems is their easy recovery and usage, which allows recycling. The recycling of 1-SG was made up to 3 Conditions: 1.0 X 10-' mol of 1 per gram of IPG; 3.0 X 10-' mol of 1 per gram of silica gel; PhIO:catalyst molar ratio of 40:1; magnetic stirring for 1 h, under argon atmosphere.

There is a decrease in its activity from the unused catalyst to the first recycling and then it remains the same until the third recycling. For 1-IPG, there is a considerable decrease after the first recycling, and in this case leaching occurs and there is bleaching of the brownish colour (Table 4) . 4. Conclusions We observed that in homogeneous system using cationic FeTM4PyP\" 1 as catalyst in the cyclohexane hydroxylation, reaction conditions such as acetonitrile as solvent and ultrasound stirring method increase the efficiency and selectivity towards cyclohexanol. Factors such as methanol, which deactivate the species Feiv(O)P+' cation radical [ 11,20] or the ortho-methylpyridyl substituent in the FePs+, which makes it difficult to stabilize this active species [ 22 ] , affect the catalysis decreasing the yield of cyclohexanol. However these factors do not affect the very fast epoxidation of cyclohexene. In this way, 1 in the methanol containing system shows high total yields of 97%, with an epoxide:alcohol:ketone selectivity of 70:9:21. FeTM2PyP5+ 2 in acetonitrile is a particularly good catalyst, with 93% of total yield, with an epoxide:alcohol:ketone selectivity of 77:12:11. Ultrasound stirring increases the efficiency of cyclohexene oxidation, however Y. lamamoto et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 99 (/995) 187-193 it decreases the selectivity towards epoxidation. In homogeneous systems, these Feps+ do not catalyze cyclohexane hydroxylation in dichloromethane, except for 4, which is amphiphilic and inherently is a good P-450 model system [ 15 ] . When supported, the polar FeP5+-IPG and Fees+-SG are particularly efficient in dichloromethane (Table 3) . These systems consist of polar hemin in isolated sites, which selectively catalyze cyclohexane oxidation in apolar solvent. In the same way, the active site of P-450 is a polar protohemin in a hydrophobic pocket, which promotes selective cyclohexane oxidation. It represents a good cytochrome P-450 model system [ 31 ] . The FeP+ in homogeneous biomimetic systems requires high concentrations =-10-3 M01. I- I to promote good catalysis conditions [ 32] . In this work, with cationic FeP5+, the more diluted 10-4 mol. 1- I was the best concentration range. These rigid cationic I-IPG, I-SG, 2-IPG and 2SG systems catalyze oxidations with very low amounts of ironporphyrins (1-3 X 10-' mol of FeP5+ per gram of solid support), which correspond to 30-80 times fewer numbers of heme catalytic sites in P-450, consider, for example, the hemoprotein P450BM-3, a holoenzyme containing one heme per unit (molecular weight of 119,000) [331.

(+55-16)6338151 Cationic ironporphyrins in solution and supported on imidazole propyl gel (IPG) and silica gel (SG) as catalyst in cyclohexane hydroxylation using iodosylarene as oxygen donor were studied. FeTM4PyP5+, 1 as homogeneous catalyst for cyclohexane hydroxylation, in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and ultrasound stirring, gives cyclohexanol (C-ol) yields of 20%. The FeTM2PyP5+, 2 as catalyst for cyclohexene oxidation in CH3CN and ultrasound stirring is a very efficient system, giving 93% of total yield, with an epoxide:alcohol:ketone selectivity of 77:12:11. The supported systems, 1-IPG and 1-SG are particularly efficient in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), giving C-ol yields of 37% and 53%, respectively. These systems consist of polar hemin in isolated sites, which selectively catalyze cyclohexane oxidation in apolar solvent. They represent good cytochrome P-450 model systems. In the same way, the active site of P-450 consists of a polar protohemin in a hydrophobic pocket, promoting selective cyclohexane oxidation. These rigid cationic 1-IPG, 1-SG, 2-IPG, 2-SG, 3-IPG and 3-SG systems can catalyze with very small amounts of ironporphyrins, which correspond to about 30–80 times fewer numbers than the hemin in P-450 catalytic site.
