A synergistic phenomenon in catalytic activity was observed for the bismuth molybdate catalysts. Under identical reaction conditions, the hydrogen sulfide conversions of the binary oxide catalysts were superior to those of the corresponding single oxide catalysts. The most active bismuth/molybdenum composition for the binary oxide catalysts was found to be 2:3 atomic ratio, which suggests that the compound Bi2Mo3012 formed in the binary oxides is much more active than the corresponding single oxide catalysts for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. The reaction rates of hydrogen sulfide oxidation over the catalysts were found to exhibit first-order dependence on the hydrogen sulfide concentration.

Introduction In the refining of petroleum, the various sulfur compounds contained in crude oil must be removed as hydrogen sulfide by catalytic hydrodesulfurization. The highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas is then often made to react with sulfur dioxide (formed in a furnace by the thermal oxidation of hydrogen sulfide) to give elemental sulfur in a sulfur recovery plant or so-called Claus plant. The sulfur recovery rate in the Claus process is only 95-98% depending on the number of reactors used therein. During the last two decades, a great number of Claus tail-gas treating (TGT) processes have been developed to increase the total * Corresponding author.

Cheng/Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 315-326 sulfur recovery efficiency. Conventional Claus TGT processes (wet type) in- volve a hydrogen sulfide absorption step, in which a tail-gas containing unre- acted hydrogen sulfide is introduced into an alkaline bath. Recently, a dry type Claus TGT process has been developed which comprises recovering elemental sulfur from the Claus tail-gas by selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in the presence of a catalytically active mixture of iron and chromium oxides deposited on an o>alumina support [1,2]. The selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide can be represented by the following reaction scheme where the oxidation of the desired product (elemental sulfur) to sulfur dioxide is the major side reaction [3]: HzS+ 1/202 -o 1/nSn +H20 (n=6o8) (1) HzS + 3/202 -o SO2 --}- H20 (2) 1/n Sn + 02 o SO2 (3) 3/nS, + 2H20 ~ HzS + SO2 (4) Reaction (4) is the reverse of so-called Claus reaction and is negligible under the low concentration of elemental sulfur and water vapor occurring in this study. Bismuth molybdate catalyst has been used extensively for the catalytic ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile [4,5], catalytic oxidation of propy- lene to acrolein [6], and for the catalytic oxidation of 1-butene to butadiene [7-9]. Although bismuth molybdate is one of the most intensively studied mixed- oxide composition [6], there is no information available about the use of bismuth molybdate catalyst for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. Therefore, the primary object of this paper is to recover elemental sulfur from a gas mixture containing hydrogen sulfide by selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide in the presence of catalyst based on the oxides of bismuth and molybdenum. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization Three single oxide catalysts (bismuth oxide alone, molybdenum oxide alone, and supported molybdenum oxide) and three binary oxide catalysts (with Bi/Mo atomic ratios of 2/1, 1/1, and 2/3) were prepared for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. The single oxide of molybde- num was prepared by adding nitric acid into an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate (NH4)6Mo7024\" 4H20 (Riedel-de Haen, Germany). The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 1.5 and precipitation occurred. The precipitate obtained was suction filtered, air dried at 150 for 4 h, and then calcined in air at 400 for 4 h. The single oxide of bismuth was prepared by air calcination of K.-T. Li, W.-D. Cheng/Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 315-326 317 bismuth nitrate Bi(NO3)3 5 H20 (Showa Chemicals, Japan) at 500 for 8 h. The supported molybdenum oxide catalyst (9 wt.-% molybdenum oxide on e~-alumina) was prepared by impregnation of a-alumina (H-218B, supplied by Nissan Girdler Co.) with ammonium molybdate. The impregnated sample was then dried at 150 for 4 h and calcined at 400 for 8 h. For the mixed oxide catalysts, an appropriate amount of bismuth nitrate was added to an aqueous solution of 1.5 wt.-% nitric acid to obtain solution A, and an appropriate amount of ammonium molybdate was dissolved in distilled water to obtain solution B. The solution A was then added dropwise to the solution B, and the pH value of the resultant mixed solution was adjusted to 1.5 by adding NH4OH (28 wt.-%) aqueous solution. White precipitate was obtained by filtration of the mixed solution. The precipitate was dried at 150 for 12 h, and then calcined at 500 for 20 h to yield a grey powder of bismuth molybdate. The specific surface areas of the catalysts prepared above were determined by nitrogen adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen with a Micromeritics BET surface area analyzer (Model Gemini). The phase analysis was performed by X-ray diffraction crystallography (Shimadzu XD-5) and scanning electron microscopy (Bausch and Lomb ARL. Nanol 2100). 2.2. Catalytic measurements A continuous fixed bed reactor having an inner diameter of 7 mm, an outer diameter of 9 mm and a length of 80 cm was used for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur. The reactor was made of Pyrex glass tubing and the reactor temperature was controlled by electrical heaters installed around the reactor. Catalyst in the form of 10-20 mesh number particles was packed into the reactor, in which quartz sand was filled at the feed end of the catalyst bed to form a preheating zone. Before the measurements of catalytic properties, the catalyst bed was pre-sulfurized for over 12 h by introducing a 10 vol.-% hydrogen sulfide gas mixture at 250 until the gas mixture leaving the reactor had a stable hydrogen sulfide concentration. For the measurements of catalytic properties, a gaseous feed consisting of 1 vol% hydrogen sulfide, 5 vol.-% oxygen and 94 vol.-% nitrogen was introduced into the reactor at 100 ml/min. The reaction product exiting the reactor was introduced into a separator in which the reaction product was separated into a solid sulfur product and a gaseous product. The composition of the gaseous product was analyzed by a HP5890 gas chromatograph with a 9-feed Porapak Q 80/100 mesh stainless steel coiled column. The column was operated isother- mally at 90, the thermal conductivity detector temperature and the injector temperature were set at 140 and at 120, respectively. Carrier gas was helium at 20 ml/min. The hydrogen sulfide conversion was defined as the moles of hydrogen sulfide reacted per mol of hydrogen sulfide in the feed stream, and the 318 K.-T. Li, W.-D.

Results and discussion Before the measurements of catalytic performances, a blank run was con- ducted without the presence of catalysts, and glass beads were used instead. The conversion of hydrogen sulfide was found to be less than 5% in the temperature range 200-300. 3.1. Single oxides Table 1 shows the catalytic performances of the molybdenum oxide alone and the s-alumina supported molybdenum oxide catalyst. The amount of the catalyst used was 2 g. For oxidation of propylene, MoO3 alone was reported to have good selectivity and low activity [6]; however, for oxidation of H2S studied here, MoO3 alone showed poor selectivity. The selectivity was only 55% at K.- T. Li, W.-D. Cheng / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 315-326 319 270 with 61.5% conversion. The selectivity was improved significantly by impregnating MoO3 on a-alumina support. Table 1 shows that the selectivity of the supported catalyst was 100% at 280 with 58% conversion. The surface areas of the supported MoO3 catalyst and the unsupported MoO3 catalyst were 4.8 m2/g and 7.26 m2/g, respectively. That is, the pore size of the supported catalyst was larger than that of the unsupported one. Therefore, the sulfur vapor produced inside the former was could more easily to escape from the pores (i.e., less opportunity for the sulfur vapor to oxidize further to sulfur dioxide) than that produced inside the latter. This probably is the reason for the selectivity improvement of the a-alumina supported MoO3 catalyst compared to that of the unsupported one. Table 1 also shows the catalytic performances of bismuth oxide alone. The amount of catalyst used was 2 g, which was the same as that used for molybdenum oxide. The maximum sulfur yield obtained for the bismuth oxide catalyst was 87% (at 250), which was much higher than that obtained for the unsupported molybdenum oxide (34%). Besides, the bismuth catalyst was found to be very stable under the reaction conditions and showed little sign of activity decay. For oxidation of propylene, Bi203 alone was reported to have low activity and caused essentially complete oxidation [6]. Therefore, the high selectivity of the bismuth oxide catalyst for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur is unexpected. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh bismuth catalyst (before presulfurization) and the spent bismuth catalyst. The composition of the fresh catalyst was Bi203, while the spent catalyst was a mixture of Bi2S3 and a:Bi203 (1) b:Bi2S3 s c:BiS2 I! i (2) b c b bc bc c b c b .. ., .. , ., Fig. 1.

The results of the scanning electron microscopic investigation are shown in Fig. 2 for the fresh bismuth catalyst and the spent bismuth catalyst. The grain size in the spent catalyst was significantly larger than that in the fresh catalyst. This suggests that the particle size of BizS3 or BiS2 was significantly larger than that of Bi203 and therefore the sulfurization of the fresh catalyst caused the swelling of the catalyst grains. Fig. 3 shows the first-order plot for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide over the bismuth catalyst. A straight line passing through zero was obtained in Fig. 3, therefore the rate of hydrogen sulfide oxidation is first-order with respect to the concentration of hydrogen sulfide under the experimental conditions.

Mixed oxides Five bismuth/molybdenum atomic ratios were studied for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, including Bi/Mo = 1/0, 2/1, 1/1, 2/3, and 0/1. The amount of each catalyst used for the measurements of the catalytic performances was only 0.5 g, which was one quarter of the amount used for Table 1. The experimental results of catalytic measurements are presented in Table 2, which also shows the results of BET surface area measurements. In Table 2, the catalytic activity of the catalysts was found to decrease in the following order: Bi/Mo=2/3 > Bi/Mo=2/1 > Bi/Mo=l/1 > Table 2 Catalytic performances of the binary oxides for selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide Temp.

Li, V~-D. Cheng/Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 315-326 Bi/Mo = 1/0 > Bi/Mo = 0/1. The data in Table 2 show that the mixed oxides of bismuth-molybdenum have better catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur than the catalysts containing only one metal oxide. This indicates that the mixing of molybdenum oxide and bismuth oxide has synergistic catalytic effects for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. The high activity of the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/1 might be due to its higher surface area (3.8 m2/g). However, the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/3 is still the most active catalyst even if the reaction rate is expressed in terms of (gmoles of H2S reacted)/(time surface area of catalyst). Boutry and co-workers [9] compared the effect of the molybdenum/bismuth ratio on the catalytic ability of bismuth molybdate catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene. Two activity peaks was observed at Bi/(Bi + Mo) = 40% and 67% (i.e., Bi/Mo = 2/3 and 2/1). Therefore, the results obtained here (the catalysts with Bi/Mo = 2/3 and Bi/Mo = 2/1 had higher activity for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur) were consistent with those obtained by Boutry et al. [9] for the oxidative dehydro- genation of 1-butene to butadiene. The consistency suggests that the reaction mechanism and the active catalytic centers for the two different reactions might be the same. Based on the reaction mechanism proposed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene [10,11], the reaction mechanism for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur might follow the two-step reduction-oxidation mechanism listed below: (1) the hydrogen sulfide reacts with a catalyst oxygen to yield elemental sulfur and the catalyst is partially reduced, (2) the partially reduced catalyst is reoxidized by the oxygen supplied in the reaction mixture. 100 - ~.a 8o Q) 60 . \"i 40 O 20 0 ,,,,,,,ll,,I,,,,,,i,,,,,,J,,i,,,,,,,,,ll,,,,,,,, 12 32 52 72 92 112 Time on Stream (hour) Fig. 4, Stability test for the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/3.

First-order plot for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide over the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/3. Fig. 4 shows the stability test results for the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/3. The catalyst activity remained stable and without significant decay for 80 h after it reached the steady value at about 60% conversion. However, the initial activity of the catalyst just after presulfurization was low. This might be due to the deactivation of active oxide sites by the high concentration hydrogen sulfide during the presulfurization stage (presulfurization might convert oxide form to sulfate form or sulfide form). The catalyst activity then increased with time (which might be due to the conversion of sulfate or sulfide back to the active oxide state when the concentration of hydrogen sulfide was decreased to 1 vol.-% in the catalytic measurement stage) and reached a steady value at about 40 h. The stable catalyst activity suggest that the catalyst composition and structure became stable after 40 h on stream. Kinetic study was done for the catalyst with Bi/Mo -- 2/3 after it reached the steady state. Fig. 5 shows the first-order plot for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide over the catalyst. A straight line passing through zero was obtained in Fig. 5; therefore, the rate of hydrogen sulfide oxidation is first-order with respect to the concentration of hydrogen sulfide under the experimental conditions. Fig. 6 shows the powder X-ray diffraction spectra of the fresh catalysts for the three bismuth-molybdenum binary oxides and for the pure bismuth oxide and for the pure molybdenum oxide. The compounds BizMo3Ol2, BizMo209 and BizMoO6 were found in the binary oxides, which corresponded to the atomic ratio of Bi/Mo = 2/3, 1/1, and 2/1, respectively. The results in Table 2 and Fig. 6 suggest that the most active Bi-Mo compound for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur is Bi2Mo3Olz, which corre- sponds to an atomic ratio of Bi/Mo = 2/3. Based on the redox mechanism 324 K.-T. Li, W.-D. Cheng/Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 315-326 (1) (2) (3) Bi203 Bi2MoO6 Bi2Mo209 ~) (4) 3 8- (5) ~ MoO3 __1 I ,,o \" o' o' \" Fig. 6.

Fig. 7 shows the scanning electron microscopy of the fresh catalyst (a) and the spent catalyst (b) for the binary oxide with Bi/Mo = 2/3. It can be seen that the morphology of the spent catalyst was about the same as that of the fresh catalyst. The needle shape filaments in the spent catalyst might be the condensed sulfur products. 4. Conclusions Bismuth molybdate catalysts with five Bi/Mo atomic ratios were studied for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. The catalyst activity was found to decrease in the following order: Bi/Mo = 2/3 > Bi/Mo=2/1 > Bi/Mo=l/1 > Bi/Mo=l/0 > Bi/Mo=0/1. That is, synergistic behavior in catalytic activity was observed for the bismuth molyb- date catalysts. The highest activity for the catalyst with Bi/Mo = 2/3 suggests K.-T. Li, W.-D.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic performances of bismuth-molybdenum binary oxides for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur were studied in a fixed-bed glass reactor in the temperature range 200–280°C. A synergistic phenomenon in catalytic activity was observed for the bismuth molybdate catalysts. Under identical reaction conditions, the hydrogen sulfide conversions of the binary oxide catalysts were superior to those of the corresponding single oxide catalysts. The most active bismuth/molybdenum composition for the binary oxide catalysts was found to be 2:3 atomic ratio, which suggests that the compound Bi2Mo3O12 formed in the binary oxides is much more active than the corresponding single oxide catalysts for the selective oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. The reaction rates of hydrogen sulfide oxidation over the catalysts were found to exhibit first-order dependence on the hydrogen sulfide concentration.",
