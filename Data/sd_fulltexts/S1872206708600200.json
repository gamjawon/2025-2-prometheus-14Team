Preparation of Ce-Zr-La-Al 2 O 3 and Supported Single Palladium Three-Way Catalyst CAI Li, ZHAO Ming, PI Zhan, GONG Maochu, CHEN Yaoqiang* College of Chemistry, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, China Abstract: Ce-Zr-La-Al 2 O 3 (CZLA) was prepared by co-precipitation and incipient wet impregnation methods and characterized by N 2 adsorption and X-ray diffraction. The 2%Pd/CZLA catalysts were prepared and studied by temperature-programmed reduction and activity tests. The CZLA supports prepared by the two methods showed good structural, textural, and oxygen storage properties, and the CZLA prepared by co-precipitation was more resistant to aging. The single Pd catalysts showed low light-off temperature and high three-way catalytic activity, especially the excellent NO conversion and aging resistance. Key words: cerium; zirconium; lanthanum; alumina; palladium; three-way catalyst; reaction temperature; aging resistance The development of the automotive industry attracts more attention on the atmosphere pollution from exhaust gases, and three-way catalysts (TWC) are the best way to remove these pollutants. The supports of TWC play a key role in determin- ing the catalytic performance of the catalysts [1–4]. Basically, the supports of TWC consist of oxygen storage materials (OSM) and Al 2 O 3 . OSM in the catalysts can store and release oxygen from the atmosphere to maintain the redox environ- ment, and Al 2 O 3 has high surface area and excellent thermal stability. These two materials have been used as supports of TWC since the 1990s and have an important effect on the development of TWC. However, the preparation procedures of the two supports are both complicated. At the same time, OSM and Al 2 O 3 cannot satisfy the future needs of TWC, which is due to the disadvantages of their textural properties and thermal stability. To meet the increasingly stringent emission standards, the supports that have high thermal stability, surface area, and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) should be prepared. Kašper and coworkers [5] reported that Al 2 O 3 modified by Ce-Zr (CZ) exhibited advantages of both Al 2 O 3 and OSM. Refs. [6–8] impregnated CZ onto Al 2 O 3 , which made CZ better dispersive owing to the high surface area of Al 2 O 3 , and this preparation method both enlarged the OSC of the support and improved its thermal stability. In our previous study [9], a solid solution, Ce-Zr-La/Al 2 O 3 (CZLA), was synthesized by co-precipitation. In this report, CZLA was synthesized by two different methods, and its tex- tural properties and OSC were studied. The catalytic per- formance of a single Pd TWC supported on the as-prepared support materials was also investigated in detail. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of supports For the preparation of CZLA by the co-precipitation method, ZrOCO 3 was dissolved in HNO 3 and mixed with other precursors in an aqueous solution. The mixed solution was then added dropwise into a mixed aqueous solution of ammonia to reach a pH value of 8.5. The precipitate was filtered, washed, dried at 120 °C for 4 h, and calcined at 900 °C for 3 h. Finally, CZLA powder was obtained and denoted co-CZLA with components of 9% CeO 2 , 9% ZrO 2 , 5% La 2 O 3 , and 77% Al 2 O 3 . For the preparation of CZLA by the impregnation method, ZrOCO 3 was dissolved in HNO 3 and mixed with Ce(NO 3 ) 3 · 6H 2 O in an aqueous solution. La/Al 2 O 3 treated at 900 °C was CAI Li et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 108–112 impregnated with the Ce-Zr mixed aqueous solution. After drying and calcination at 900 °C for 3 h, CZLA powder was obtained, which was denoted im-CZLA, with the same com- ponents as co-CZLA. 1.2 Preparation of catalysts All the catalysts were prepared by impregnating the CZLA powder with H 2 PdCl 6 aqueous solution at a Pd loading of 2%. The desired water and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O and La(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O promoters were added into the above solution and then ball-milled to form a slurry. The resulting slurry was coated on a honey-comb cordierite (2.5 ml, 25.8 holes/cm 2 ), and the washcoat was then dried and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in air. Finally, a monolithic catalyst was obtained. The catalyst pre- pared from co-CZLA was labeled as Cat1, and that prepared from im-CZLA was labeled as Cat2. The aged catalysts were obtained by calcination of the catalysts at 1000 °C for 4 h. 1.3 Characterization of supports and catalysts Surface area analysis of the supports was carried out by the BET method using an Autosorb-ZXF-05 instrument (Xibei Chemical Institute, China). OSC was measured by oxygen pulse adsorption at an oxygen pulse of 16.4 μmol every 3–5 min with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A 0.2 g sample was first reduced in H 2 (40 ml/min) at 550 °C for 45 min and then cooled to 200 °C. When no oxygen was stored, the OSC values of the sample were calculated. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a D/max-rA rotary diffractometer using Cu K α radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) operated at 50 kV and 180 mA. Temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) experiments were preformed on a quartz tubular microreactor. The sample (50 mg, 20–40 mesh) was pretreated in a flow of N 2 (40 ml/min) at temperatures ranging from room temperature (RT) to 400 °C and maintained at this temperature for 30 min, The reduction was performed with a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 (30 ml/min) mixture at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from RT to 900 ºC. The residual H 2 was detected by TCD. 1.4 Catalytic tests of catalysts The three-way catalytic activity was evaluated in a multiple fixed-bed continuous flow microreactor by passing a gas mixture similar to the exhaust gas from a gasoline engine, and the gases were regulated using mass-flow controllers. The simulated exhaust gas was a mixture of 0.86% CO, 0.06% C 3 H 8 , 0.06% NO, 12% CO 2 , 10% H 2 O, O 2 (adjustable), and balance N 2 . The gas space velocity was 17000 h –1 . The con- centrations of CO, C 3 H 8 , and NO were analyzed online by a five-component FGA-4001 analyzer before and after the stimulated gas passed the microreactor. The curves of the rela- tionship between conversion and temperature were obtained. T 50% (the temperature at which the conversion of a certain reactant reached 50%) and T 90% (the temperature at which the conversion of a certain reactant reached 90%) were used to show the catalytic activity of the catalysts. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Textural and oxygen storage properties of supports The surface area and OSC of the two CZLA supports before and after aging are shown in Table 1. The surface area was 106 m 2 /g for fresh co-CZLA and 136 m 2 /g for fresh im-CZLA. The surface areas of the two supports after aging were still about 100 m 2 /g, which was due to the high Al 2 O 3 content (77%) in the materials, indicating that the textural properties of CZLA were similar to that of Al 2 O 3 . The pore volume of fresh co-CZLA was 0.30 ml/g, and it was slightly smaller than that of fresh im-CZLA (0.37 ml/g). The average pore size of fresh co-CZLA and im-CZLA samples were 9.8 and 8.5 nm, re- spectively. After calcination at 1000 °C for 4 h, the average pore size increased to 10.5 nm for co-CZLA and 9.9 nm for im-CZLA. The increase of the average pore size of co-CZLA after aging was less than 10%, indicating that co-CZLA had better thermal stability. The surface area of im-CZLA de- creased by 20%, while the average pore size increased by 20% after aging, which indicated that im-CZLA had poorer thermal stability than co-CZLA. In general, both the texture and sta- bility of the two materials can meet the requirements of TWC supports. Table 1 Textural properties and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of different Ce-Zr-La-Al 2 O 3 supports Sample Surface area (m 2 /g) Pore volume (ml/g) Pore diameter (nm) OSC (μmol/g) co-CZLA fresh 106 0.30 9.8 114 aged 92 0.28 10.5 94 im-CZLA fresh 136 0.37 8.5 110 aged 110 0.31 9.9 89 co-CZLA: Ce-Zr-La-Al 2 O 3 prepared by co-precipitation. im-CZLA: Ce-Zr-La-Al 2 O 3 prepared by impregnation. The OSC of fresh co-CZLA was 114 μmol/g and decreased to 94 μmol/g (17%) after aging, while that of im-CZLA de- creased from 110 to 89 μmol/g (19%). The OSC of co-CZLA was slightly higher than that of im-CZLA. This result shows that the catalysts were quite stable because both the decreases in OSC were less than 20%. It was reported that the deactiva- tion of TWC mainly results from the decrease of the oxygen storage amount [10]. Therefore, the good texture and OSC stability of the as-prepared materials were very important for the improvement of catalytic performance of the catalysts. CAI Li et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 108–112 2.2 XRD results of supports Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh and aged sup- ports. It is clear that the fresh and aged co-CZLA samples had the structure of cubic CeO 2 , and no γ-Al 2 O 3 phase was detected. This result has not been reported in the literature. The absence of the γ-Al 2 O 3 phase revealed that the other three metal cations were inserted into the CeO 2 lattice. After calcination at 1000 °C for 4 h, phase separation did not happen, indicating that co-CZLA had better thermal stability, which was also proved by the BET results. At the same time, diffraction peaks of the fresh sample were broad and dispersive, and those of the aged sample were still broad, indicating that CZLA prepared by co-precipitation had a smaller crystal particle size and excellent thermal stability. Therefore, it can be concluded that the good structure stability made a contribution to the texture and OSC stability of co-CZLA. The patterns of im-CZLA in Fig. 1 show the presence of the γ-Al 2 O 3 phase and CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution with cubic CeO 2 lattice, which was resulted from thermal treatment of im-CZLA after Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 were impregnated onto Al 2 O 3 . The increase of the crystallite size after calcination at 1000 °C for 4 h was responsible for the loss of OSC, indicating the decrease of Ce cation efficiency [11] in the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution. Based on the structure, texture, and OSC analysis, the two materials can meet the rigorous criteria of thermal stability. The stable and single phase of co-CZLA was more suitable for the support of TWC. The crystal sizes of both materials were calculated using the Scherrer equation with corrections for instrumental line broadening and the half width of the diffraction peak of the CeO 2 (111) plane. The crystallite size of co-CZLA was larger than that of im-CZLA before and after aging. The increase in crystallite size of co-CZLA after aging was 4.8 nm (increased by 88%, from 5.5 to 10.3 nm), while that of im-CZLA was 5.6 nm (increased by 175%, from 3.2 to 8.8 nm). The crystallite size increase of im-CZLA was greater than that of co-CZLA, showing that co-CZLA had better thermal stability than im-CZLA. 2.3 H 2 -TPR results of catalysts The results of H 2 -TPR tests are shown in Fig. 2. The peak below 400 °C was attributed to the reduction of the active components in all catalysts. Kašpar et al. [5] reported that the active phase of Pd TWC is PdO. The transformation from PdO to Pd determines the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Lower reduction temperature of PdO can give higher catalyst activity. In this study, the active component of Pd was well dispersed on co-CZLA because of the single phase of co-CZLA and the advantages of both OSM and Al 2 O 3 in CZLA. After the catalysts were aged, the reduction peak of PdO shifted to a higher temperature, indicating that the transformation from PdO to Pd became difficult, which was resulted from the sin- tering of the active components and the interaction between the promoters and active components. The aged Cat1 was reduced at a lower temperature than the aged Cat2, and the reduction peak area of Cat1 changed little before and after aging, indi- cating that Cat1 had better thermal stability. The opposite peaks at about 100 °C in the H 2 -TPR curves of all the fresh and aged catalysts were due to the desorption of H 2 , which was adsorbed on the catalysts at RT, with the tem- perature rising. Moreover, the obvious peaks above 400 °C were caused by the reduction of Ce 4+ [11] including surface Ce 4+ and bulk Ce 4+ . It was reported that the difference between oxygen in the bulk and on the surface of the material makes Ce 4+ in the bulk different from those on the surface [12]. This indicated that the shoulder peaks corresponded to the reduction Fig. 2 H 2 -TPR profiles of different Pd/CZLA catalyst samples (1) Fresh Cat1, (2) Aged Cat1, (3) Fresh Cat2, (4) Aged Cat2 (Cat1, the catalyst prepared from co-CZLA; Cat2, the catalyst prepared from im-CZLA.) Fig. 1 XRD patterns of fresh and aged supports (1) Fresh co-CZLA, (2) Aged co-CZLA, (3) Fresh im-CZLA, (4) Aged im-CZLA CAI Li et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(2): 108–112 of the surface Ce 4+ , while the main peaks were attributed to the reduction of the bulk Ce 4+ . Ce 4+ in co-CZLA was well sepa- rated by Al cations, and it was difficult for Ce 4+ to move or congregate, so the Ce 4+ peak of Cat1 changed little after aging. Furthermore, the main peak and the shoulder peak of Cat2 were separated after aging and shifted to higher temperature and lower temperature, respectively, which was resulted from the oxygen storage material on γ-Al 2 O 3 . 2.4 Catalytic performance of catalysts To investigate the effect of the new supports on TWC, T 50% and T 90% of the Pd/CZLA catalysts, the most important criteria, are listed in Table 2. T 50% and T 90% of C 3 H 8 on fresh Cat1 were 292 and 330 °C, respectively. ΔT (T 90% – T 50% ) was 38 °C, which indicated that the catalyst was light-off as soon as the pollutants were completely converted. T 50% of C 3 H 8 on fresh Cat2 was similar to that on Cat1. After aging, T 50% and T 90% of C 3 H 8 on Cat1 rose to 347 and 384 °C, respectively, and ΔT was 37 °C, which was similar to fresh Cat1. T 50% and T 90% of C 3 H 8 on aged Cat1 were 22 and 21 °C lower than that on aged Cat2, respectively, indicating that Cat1 exhibited better thermal stability than Cat2. Considering the results of support charac- terization, it can be found that the thermal stability of the sup- ports can significantly affect the thermal stability of the cata- lysts. The two CZLA samples were all suitable to be the sup- port of TWC owing to their excellent thermal stability, and co-CZLA had better performance than im-CZLA. The conversion of NO is very important for TWC and cor- responds to the reductive properties of TWC. Rh shows ex- cellent activity to remove NO, but its high price and lack inhibit the development of TWC. For Pd-only three-way catalysts, NO is removed by Pd loaded on OSM. In this study, CZLA was used as a substitute for OSM and Al 2 O 3 , and the conversion of NO was significantly improved. The temperature properties of the catalysts for NO conversion are listed in Table 2. It is well known that the high activity of catalysts on NO conversion corresponds to low T 50% and T 90% . ΔT was about 20 °C over the two fresh catalysts, indicating that NO can be quickly and completely converted on the catalysts after it was light-off. After aging, T 50% of NO conversion was 312 °C for Cat1 and 325 °C for Cat2, and increased by 59 and 76 °C, respectively. ΔT on aged Cat1 was only 27 °C, which was similar to the Pt/Rh TWC [13]. NO on aged Cat1 can still be quickly trans- formed from light-off to complete conversion. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the catalyst supported on co-CZLA exhibited high activity, good thermal stability, and excellent temperature property. There- fore, CZLA can substitute for both OSM and Al 2 O 3 . ΔT over Cat2 was 55 °C, showing that Cat2 also had good catalytic performance for NO conversion. Fig. 3 shows the temperature curves of CO, C 3 H 8 , and NO conversion on fresh and aged catalysts. On fresh Cat1 and Cat2, the temperatures for complete conversion of CO were 240 ºC. C 3 H 8 and NO could be quickly and completely con- verted after the light-off temperature was achieved. ΔT of C 3 H 8 and NO conversion over aged Cat1 were similar to those of fresh Cat1, indicating that Cat1 had good three-way catalytic performance. The temperature property of aged Cat2 for C 3 H 8 conversion was similar to that of fresh Cat2. However, after Cat2 was aged, ΔT for NO conversion significantly increased, indicating that Cat2 had worse temperature property than Cat1.

The aged co-CZLA has no phase separation and exhibits better thermal stability than im-CZLA. The Pd-only catalyst supported on CZLA has good three-way catalytic performance, especially for the conversion of NO, indicating that CZLA can be used as a high performance support material in a TWC system and substitute for both OSM and Al 2 O 3 .

        "dc:description": "Ce-Zr-La-Al2O3 (CZLA) was prepared by co-precipitation and incipient wet impregnation methods and characterized by N2 adsorption and X-ray diffraction. The 2%Pd/CZLA catalysts were prepared and studied by temperature-programmed reduction and activity tests. The CZLA supports prepared by the two methods showed good structural, textural, and oxygen storage properties, and the CZLA prepared by co-precipitation was more resistant to aging. The single Pd catalysts showed low light-off temperature and high three-way catalytic activity, especially the excellent NO conversion and aging resistance.",
