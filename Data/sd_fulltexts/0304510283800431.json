SINFELT Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Linden, NJ 07036 (U.S.A.) Summary NMR studies of alumina-supported platinum catalysts are presented. For the samples studied, the dispersion (fraction of Pt atoms on the surface) ranged from 4% to 76%. The '\"Pt absorption line-shapes exhibit dramatic differences among samples. Certain features of these line-shapes have been assigned to various kinds of Pt sites in the Pt particles. In samples with adsorbed CO (\"C enriched), \"C-195?! double resonance was used to resolve that part of the Pt line-shape which arises from surface Pt bonded to the CO molecules. The results are compared with NMR data taken on Pt carbonyls. Introduction We have been applying nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to the study of platinum catalysts. We report here some of the highlights of our results. For a more detailed account, we refer the reader to previous papers [1-4], as well as to forthcoming papers. Here, we present NMR absorption line- shapes for various samples of platinum catalysts. In these samples we have varied the size of the Pt particles, as well as the chemical nature of the sur- face of the particles. As a result, we have been able to assign certain features of these line-shapes to various kinds of Pt sites in the Pt particles. Experimental Samples The samples consisted of small particles of Pt metal supported on T?- alumina. They were prepared at Exxon Research Laboratories by a standard *Present address: Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, U.S.A.

Their dispersion (fraction of Pt atoms on the surface of the particles) was measured by hydrogen chemisorption. All the samples contained 10% Pt by weight except for the 76%-dispersion sample which contained 5% Pt by weight. Results General: NMR shifts Consider a nuclear spin in a fixed external DC magnetic field Hy. Inter- actions between the spin and its local environment can have a great effect on the NMR frequency VQ of that spin. Hence, for a given nuclear spin, the exact position of the NMR signal in different compounds is generally displaced by varying amounts. For '\"Pt, the most important of these displacements is caused by interactions with nearby electrons. Polarization of the electron orbital moments gives rise to a displacement called the chemical shift. In platinum metal, polarization of the conduction-electron spins gives rise to an additional displacement called the Knight shift. In Fig. 1 we show the posi- tions of the '\"Ft NMR signals for various Pt compounds (chemical shifts), as well as that for bulk Pt metal (Knight shift). Both the chemical and Knight shifts are due to local interactions. Now consider a small particle of Pt atoms. We would expect the Pt nuclei in the particle's interior, far from any surface, to find themselves in an environment like that of bulk Pt metal. These nuclei should thus exhibit a Knight shift equal to that of bulk Pt metal. On the other hand, Pt nuclei near the surface of the particle would certainly be in an environment different Chemical Shifts , c u -9 N ~ < jr fl-Z W^i^ 11- f3 Q- CL C4 M^ NQ_ <- CM CSJ 0 0 *, 0 CM Q- 0.1 I Z Z 0.

The chem- ical shift for H2Pt(OH)g has been measured in this work. Fig. 2. NMR absorption line-shapes for six samples at 77 K and VQ = 74 MHz. The disper- sions of these samples are 4%, 11%, 15%, 26%, 46% and 58% for (a) through (f), respec- tively. These samples are 'untreated' as explained in the text. 323 from that of bulk Pt metal and consequently exhibit different Knight shifts. In a large collection of particles of different sizes and shapes, there are many different kinds of sites for Pt nuclei near the surface. Since each different kind of site gives rise in general to a different Knight shift, we would find a distribution of Knight shifts among these nuclei in such a sample. This results in an inhomogeneously broadened NMR absorption line. Untreated samples Data were taken using a pulsed NMR spectrometer operated at VQ = 74 MHz (Ho =80-85 kG for '\"Ft). Because of the large inhomogeneous broadening in our samples, we were unable to observe free induction decays. Thus, we employed the well-known spin-echo technique [6] that essentially removes the effect of inhomogeneous broadening by refocusing the nuclear magnetization into an echo. NMR absorption line-shapes were obtained by signal-averaging the spin echo, point by point, at different values of Hy across the line. We show in Fig. 2 the ^Pt NMR absorption line-shapes for six differ- ent samples. Their dispersions range from 4% to 58%, as indicated in the figure. These samples were not treated in any particular way but were simply opened to the atmosphere after their preparation. As can be seen, the line- shapes are very broad, extending the full range of the Knight shifts, from that of non-metallic compounds to that of bulk Pt metal (compared with Fig. 1). As we move from samples of larger particles (smaller dispersion) to those of progressively smaller particles (larger dispersion), the intensity of the line shifts from the 'metallic' end of the line-shape (the high-field end) to the 'non-metallic' end (the low-field end). Two peaks of interest here can be seen in many of the line-shapes. The first peak is at 1.138 kG/MHz which is at the exact position of ^Pt in bulk Pt metal. This peak arises from Pt nuclei which are deep within the interior of the larger Pt particles. The electronic environment of these Pt nuclei is very much like that of bulk Pt metal. As expected, the intensity of this peak is greater in samples containing larger Pt particles. The second peak is at 1.089 kG/MHz and arises from Pt nuclei on the surface of the particles. The intensity of this peak is greater in samples con- taining smaller Pt particles. The position of this peak corresponds exactly to that of ^Pt in H2Pt(OH)e (see Fig. 1). Chemical shifts are very sensitive to the species of ligand forming the bonds as well as to the coordination of the ligand. This is especially true for the OH ligand which produces one of the largest paramagnetic shifts known for ^Pt. Thus we feel it is reasonable to conclude that this peak in our line-shapes arises from surface Pt which are each bonded to six OH groups. The reactions with the atmosphere which cause this result are still under investigation. Note that our conclusion requires that the surface be reconstructed and that all Pt Pt bonds at the surface be broken. This result is consistent with recent EXAFS studies of Sinfelt [7]. In very high-dispersion Pt samples which had been exposed to air, they found that there are no Pt-Pt bonds. 324 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 HoAo (kG/MHz) 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 HoA'o (kG/MHz) Fig. 3. NMR absorption line-shapes from spin echoes and SEDOR for two samples at 77 K and VQ = 74 MHz. The dispersions of these samples are 26% amd 76% for (a) and (b), respectively. The Pt particles in these samples have chemisorbed CO molecules on the sur- face. Samples treated with CO We show in Fig. 3 the ^Pt line-shapes for two different samples (26% and 76% dispersion) which were cleaned by oxygen and hydrogen cycles at 300 C and then exposed to CO (90% enriched \"C) at room temperature. Approximately half a monolayer of CO was chemisorbed. As can be seen, this chemical treatment greatly affected the line-shape at the low-field end. (Compare the 26%-dispersion sample in Figs. 2 and 3.) The local environ- ment of the Pt nuclei near or at the surface of the particles was significantly altered, as would be expected. In order to isolate the contribution to the line-shape by the surface Pt, we employed an NMR double-resonance technique called spin-echo double resonance [6] (SEDOR). Double-resonance techniques depend on the inter- action between two different kinds of nuclear spins (in this case, ^Pt and \"C). Since the interaction falls off rapidly with distance, only nearest-neigh- bor Pt-C pairs contribute significantly to the SEDOR signal. Thus the SEDOR signal is a good measure of the NMR absorption line-shape due to the surface Pt alone, i.e., those Pt bonded to CO molecules at the catalyt- ically active sites.

Note that although the line-shapes due to all the Pt nuclei in the samples are very different for the two samples, the SEDOR line-shapes due to only the surface Pt are strikingly similar. The NMR characteristics of the surface Pt are largely determined by the nature of the chemical bonding to the nearby CO molecules and not by the size of the particle itself. We compared our results in Pt catalysts with that in Pt carbonyl mole- cules, which are often used as models of the Pt catalytic surface. As can be seen in Table 1, we found that the position of the surface Pt resonance in our catalysts is very close to those in various Pt carbonyls. (The variations among the positions shown in Table 1 are small compared to typical varia- tions among Pt compounds. Compare with Fig. 1.) Thus, from the NMR data alone, we conclude that the Pt atoms in the Pt carbonyl molecules be- have very much like those on the surface of Pt catalyst particles. Acknowledgements We are grateful to H.
