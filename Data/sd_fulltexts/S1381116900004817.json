Fax: +55-21-590-7135 Cr/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of chromium acetate (1 and 3wt.% Cr) and bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate (0.5wt.% Cr) over commercial silica. These samples were analyzed by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of CO and C2H4 adsorbed in order to characterize the chromium species, mainly Cr2+ species distribution (Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C) and polymerization aspects. The catalysts prepared with chromium acetate presented only Cr6+ after calcination, while the catalyst prepared with bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate presented Cr6+ and a fraction of Cr3+. After reduction with CO, the catalysts prepared with chromium acetate showed more Cr2+ B than Cr2+ A species. The distribution of Cr2+ species influenced the catalytic activity. The catalyst with 3wt.% Cr from acetate presented the greatest amount of species Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B and the best polymerization activity. The behavior of isolated hydroxyls band during polymerization tests, characterized by FT-IR, suggests its participation in the reaction mechanism. Keywords Cr/SiO2 TPR FT-IR Ethylene polymerization 1 Introduction Cr/SiO2 catalysts have been used in the ethylene polymerization since 1950s decade. Despite the efforts of many researchers, some parameters of this system, like the distribution of active sites to polymerization, still remain not well characterized. Nowadays, there is a general agreement to ascribe the Cr2+ species as the active site to ethylene polymerization. The formation of three different Cr2+ species has been observed as a function of the chromium-surface hydroxyl interaction [1–6]. These species are assigned as Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C. Cr2+ A is the the most reactive species involved in the polymerization [4,6]. The Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species can be identified by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of carbon monoxide adsorbed at 2179 and 2188cm−1, respectively, while Cr2+ C can be seen in the hydroxyl group region at 3600cm−1 [2]. The amount of each species depends on the calcination temperature, as well as other preparation parameters. Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C species decrease with increase of this temperature, following by the reduction on the surface hydroxyls and the appearance of inactive Cr3+ from Cr6+ decomposition. On the other hand, Cr2+ A is transformed into Cr2+ C at high temperatures (973K) under vacuum [4,6]. These changes in the chromium species distribution modify the polymerization activity. Several polymerization mechanisms have been reported [6–13], with two different reaction pathways. Jozwiak et al. [7] and Groeneveld et al. [8] suggested that initiation step starts with the migration of a proton from the hydroxyls adjacent to the active site to the monomer. They also suggested that the initiation proceeds via the adsorption of ethylene on the active Cr site and then its combination with an adjacent hydroxyl yielding an ethyl group. However, McDaniel and Welch [9,10] reported that high activity could be obtained by using completely dehydroxilated catalysts. Other mechanisms were proposed, without hydrogen transfer. Kantcheva et al. [11] suggested a mechanism via carbene ion, where ethylene is adsorbed directly on Cr sites with the formation of ethylidene (Cr=CH–R) species, preceding the formation of polymer chains. Ghiotti et al. [6] proposed the formation of a metallocyclobutane structure obtained by adsorption of two ethylene molecules on active Cr site. They also observed a band at 2750cm−1 corresponding to the υ(CH) mode of a carbene group interacting with the Cr site. Thus, there are different possibilities of mechanisms taking place, but the prevailing mechanism will depend on the surface active Cr sites and their vicinity. The distribution of Cr2+ species and the polymerization activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts have been determined in the literature by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of CO and C2H4 adsorbed, although these analyses have been reported separately. Thus, the aim of this work is to determine the Cr2+ species distribution and its behavior in the ethylene polymerization activity on Cr/SiO2 catalysts with different chromium contents and precursor salts. Analyses of temperature programmed reduction (TPR) were used to characterize the Cr species after calcination of the samples and FT-IR technique after reduction and adsorption of CO and C2H4, to investigate the active sites of chromium. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the catalysts Cr/SiO2 catalysts containing 0.5, 1 and 3wt.% Cr were prepared by wetness impregnation using chromium(II) acetate (Aldrich, 99%) and bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate as precursor salts on a commercial silica gel (Davison 955, 299m2/g and 1.65cm3/g). After stirring for 18h, in water for the acetate and n-hexane for the bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate, the catalysts were dried at 353K under vacuum and calcined in dry air flow at 773K for 30min. Table 1 summarizes the catalysts: chromium contents, precursor salts and sample codes. Bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate was prepared by using chromium trioxide and triphenylsilanol and purified with carbon tetrachloride, following the procedure described by Carrick et al. [14]. 2.2 Characterizations The analyses of temperature programmed reduction (TPR) were accomplished in an equipment with thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The catalysts (0.5g) were dried under argon flow at 773K for 1h and reduced up to 1073K with 1.6wt.% H2/Ar flow (30ml/min). The analyses of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) were carried out in a Varian Cary 5 spectrometer in the 200 to 800nm range (UV-VIS). The reference for the experiments was the support of the catalysts. The standards Cr2O3 and CrO3 (Aldrich) were also analyzed by DRS and TPR. Infrared spectroscopy experiments were performed on a FT-IR Perkin-Elmer 2000 spectrometer with a resolution of 4cm−1. Self supported wafers (∼10mg/cm2) were pretreated in situ in a cell equipped with CaF2 window. Pretreatment followed the sequence: dry under N2 flow at 773K for 1h, reduction with 300Torr CO for 30min at 623K and then evacuation at 10−5 Torr at 773K for 1h. After that, CO chemisorption was performed at room temperature. FT-IR spectra of the samples after reduction were obtained rationing the experimental spectra by the spectra of the dried samples. Similarly, the CO chemisorbed spectra were obtained rationing the experimental spectra by the spectra of the reduced samples. Polymerization studies were performed at room temperature, by adding a small pulse of ethylene (5Torr) to the reduced sample. Twelve sequences of 5 scans were obtained in the first 10min, immediately after ethylene addition and two more 5 scans after the following 20 and 30min. The single beam spectra just obtained were rationed against the spectra of the reduced sample in order to provide the final spectra. 3 Results and discussion Chromium contents, determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and the sample codes are reported in Table 1. The impregnation of organochromium salts followed by calcination had the aim to get well-dispersed chromium over the support, as reported in other catalytic systems [15]. The results of thermogravimetric analyses showed that the decomposition of both precursor salts was complete in the calcination. The catalysts from acetate showed an homogeneous yellow color after calcination, which is ascribed to Cr6+ ions. The analyses of TPR (temperature programmed reduction) of the CrO3 resulted in a single reduction peak, corresponding to 28.9μmols H2/mg Cr, ascribed to the complete reduction of CrO3 to Cr2O3, while the Cr2O3 did not reduce. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analyses of the catalysts after TPR showed characteristic bands of Cr2O3 at 272, 355, 467 and 610nm in the 200–800nm range (UV-VIS). These results evidenced that the final oxidation state of chromium was 3+, as reported elsewhere [16,17]. Considering that the consumption of H2 corresponds to the complete reduction of CrO3 to Cr2O3, the average oxidation state of chromium on the calcined catalysts was determined (Table 1). It turns out that the catalysts from the acetate precursor presented prevailing Cr6+ ions while 0.5CrB catalyst, from bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate, also presented a fraction of Cr3+ ions, as Cr2O3, after calcination, resulting the lowest average oxidation state. These attributions were also observed in the DRS analyses. The 1CrA and 3CrA presented bands at 278 and 358nm ascribed to CrO3, while catalyst 0.5CrB also presented small bands at 467 and 609nm reported as Cr2O3 [18,19]. As showed in Fig. 1 , the reduction profiles were distinct with chromium contents and precursor salts. The 1CrA and 0.5CrB catalysts showed only one reduction peak with maximum H2 consumption at 769 and 752K, respectively, while the 3CrA catalyst showed two peaks, at 649 and 743K. The peak at 649K can be ascribed to large Cr6+ particles, probably formed because the amount of hydroxyls groups was not sufficient to stabilize all the chromium on the silica surface. FT-IR spectra of the reduced samples in the hydroxyls region (3800–3400cm−1) showed bands at 3747 and 3725cm−1 and a broad band centered around 3600cm−1. The integration of these bands normalized by chromium loading is presented in Table 2 . The band at 3747cm−1 is due to isolated hydroxyls [2] and its intensity decreases as the chromium content increases, since chromium is anchored on isolated hydroxyls of silica during the preparation [20]. McDaniel [10], using a porous silica (280m2/g and 1.6cm3/g), observed a content of 2.85% Cr corresponding to a complete coverage of Cr over silica. Our results agree with McDaniel, although some residual hydroxyls could be detected on the 3CrA catalyst. The catalysts also exhibited one band at 3600cm−1, which is ascribed to the interaction of Cr2+ C with the hydroxyls of the support [2]. The normalized integrated band presented significantly different values (Table 2). It turns out that the 1CrA catalyst presented greater amounts of Cr2+ C species than the 3CrA, which agrees with the structure of this species proposed by Kim and Woo [2], who suggested two adjacent silanol groups interacting with one Cr atom. However, the 0.5CrB catalyst presented lower Cr2+ C content than 1CrA, probably due to the presence of Cr3+ in the former, as suggested in the TPR results. Indeed, Cr2O3 was not reduced to Cr2+, when a physical mixture of Cr2O3 (3wt.% Cr) with silica was submitted to reduction with CO at 623K. The catalysts also showed one band at 3725cm−1, which was related to Cr2+ B, according to the literature [2]. Thus, considering that the extinction coefficients for Cr2+ species are equal, the ratio of the integrated areas Cr2+ C/Cr2+ B was between 4 and 5 for the 1CrA and 0.5CrB catalysts and around 2 for the 3CrA sample. These results were supported by the relative abundance of hydroxyls at the surface of the catalysts. It evidenced that with increasing Cr content the number of free isolated hydroxyls decreased. The infrared spectra of CO adsorbed are shown in Fig. 2 . In the narrow CO adsorption region (2200–2160cm−1) only the 1CrA and 3CrA catalysts showed absorption bands. The 0.5CrB catalyst did not show any band in this region. The amount of Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species in this catalyst is probably small to be detected by FT-IR in the CO adsorption region. This assumption is supported by the presence of a fraction of Cr2O3 and the relative high concentration of Cr2+ C, in comparison with Cr2+ B. For the 1CrA and 3CrA catalysts, the use of a computational Gaussian deconvolution resulted in two bands at 2180 and 2188cm−1, which were ascribed to CO bonded to Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species, respectively [2]. The total intensity band of the CO chemisorption on 3CrA was more pronounced than on 1CrA. From the FT-IR results it was possible to evaluate the distribution of Cr2+ species, as defined by a linear combination of the species Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C. It was obtained calculating the Cr2+ B/Cr2+ A ratio from the CO adsorbed bands and Cr2+ C/Cr2+ B from the hydroxyls band region (Table 2). Considering that the extinction coefficients are equal for all Cr2+ species, the relative percentage of Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C are presented in Table 3 . The amount of Cr2+ B species was more abundant than Cr2+ A in both catalysts, 1CrA and 3CrA. The fraction of active sites Cr2+ A+Cr2+ B was determined, being the higher value for the 3CrA catalyst. This result suggests that the 3CrA catalyst may be more active in the polymerization than 1CrA. In our FT-IR procedure, a treatment of vacuum at 773K was carried out after reduction in order to remove residual carbon monoxide. In earlier studies, Garrone et al. [3–5] used mild temperatures between 423 and 623K, probably to avoid the conversion of Cr2+ A species into Cr2+ C. That means, it is possible that a fraction of Cr2+ A was converted into Cr2+ C under vacuum after the reduction. Thus, changes in the pre-treatment can result better performance in the polymerization. FT-IR experiments of adsorbed ethylene were also performed after CO reduction, following evacuation at 773K, since residual CO should inhibit ethylene polymerization on Cr/SiO2 [21]. Each experiment was obtained with twelve groups of 5 scans, immediately after ethylene uptake, during the first 10min. The 13th and 14th scans were obtained after 20 and 30min, respectively. The 1CrA and 3CrA catalysts exhibited three main bands, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. The band at 2988cm−1 can be ascribed to υ s(CH2) of ethylene π-adsorbed on Cr2+ sites [11–13], although Sheppard and Yates [22] suggested that this band occurs at 2980cm−1. The other two bands, at 2920 and 2852cm−1, correspond to υ as(CH2) and υ s(CH2) of the polymer chain. The band at 2988cm−1 practically did not change during the analyses for all catalysts. The 0.5CrB catalyst showed the band at 2988cm−1 and another very small band at 2920cm−1, which did not change significantly during the analyses. However, the band at 2852cm−1 was not detected for this catalyst. These results are coherent with low concentration of active species, since no adsorption of CO was observed for the 0.5CrB catalyst. The FT-IR spectra of 1CrA and 3CrA in the 1500–1350cm−1 region showed three bands at 1445, 1465 and 1470cm−1. The first one was attributed to ethylene π-adsorbed on Cr2+ sites, that also remained constant during the analyses as observed for the band at 2988cm−1. The bands at 1465 and 1470 cm−1 were ascribed to bending modes of methylene groups of polyethylene [11–13]. Indeed, these bands increased, following the same behavior of the 2920 and 2855cm−1 bands. Table 4 presents the integrated areas of the 2988 and 2920cm−1 bands of ethylene polymerization after 30min of reaction (14th spectrum). From the 2988cm−1 band, it turned out that the 0.5CrB catalyst exhibited greater amount of ethylene π-adsorbed than the other two catalysts. On the other hand, it was inversely proportional to the activity: the activity was lower with more π-adsorbed ethylene on Cr2+ sites. This behavior suggests the existence of two types of Cr2+ sites: one which is active for the polymerization and other one that just adsorbs ethylene [12]. Therefore, the Cr2+ C species could be classified in the second case whereas the Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species in the first case, according to the distribution of these species in the catalysts. Following the 2920cm−1 band, which was ascribed to a polymer chain growth, the 3CrA catalyst presented the highest value of the integrated area, and therefore, a better activity than the 1CrA and 0.5CrB samples, as shown in Table 4. Fig. 5 presents the behavior of the polyethylene (-CH2-) band at 2920cm−1 with time. An initial polymer absorbance was noted just at the beginning of the experiment on both samples. Without induction time, the 1CrA catalyst showed low initial activity. Polymerization stopped after reaching 10min on 3CrA and 20min on 1CrA. There are two main suggestions that could explain this behavior: the first one is that the polymerization proceeded on active Cr2+ sites just at the beginning, as observed in the FT-IR analyses, but then the polymer blocked the access to the other sites, interrupting the reaction. The second explanation is the possible presence of poisons in the ethylene feed, such as oxygen or water. The differences in polymerization activity on both catalysts should not be attributed entirely to the presence of the Cr2+ A species, since 1CrA and 3CrA exhibited almost the same fraction of this species (Table 3). Probably, there is a contribution of the Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species. Indeed, the 3CrA catalyst presented approximately 1.4 times more Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B species than 1CrA (Table 3), which agreed with the change of the integrated absorbance of 2920cm−1 band of ethylene polymerization (Table 4). According to the literature, Cr2+ A is the most reactive species in the polymerization, but Cr2+ B or mixed species of Cr2+ A and Cr2+ B are not discarded [3,4,6]. Finally, Fig. 6 presents the behavior of isolated hydroxyls during the polymerization reaction, by integration of the band at 3745cm−1. This band was not shifted to 3696cm−1, which was ascribed to the interaction of surface hydroxyls with the polymer chain [9,13]. The band at 3745cm−1 showed a random behavior, whereas Jozwiak et al. [7] observed linearity. Besides, the amounts of isolated hydroxyls before and at the end of the polymerization growth were similar, suggesting that the hydroxyls contributed to the polymerization mechanism, in agreement with the reaction mechanisms proposed by Jozwiak et al. [7] and Groeneveld et al. [8]. 4 Conclusions FT-IR spectroscopy analyses allow to characterize the three Cr2+ species (Cr2+ A, Cr2+ B and Cr2+ C) in Cr/SiO2 catalysts and their different behaviors in the ethylene polymerization. The chromium content, which influenced the amount of surface hydroxyls and the precursor salt affected largely the Cr2+ species distribution. Different activities of ethylene polymerization was observed on two catalysts with similar Cr2+ A content. The 3CrA catalyst presented the greatest amount of Cr2+ A+Cr2+ B species and the best activity. Our results suggested that not only Cr2+ A, but also Cr2+ B or a mixed Cr2+ A+Cr2+ B sites have activity in the polymerization. The behavior of isolated hydroxyls band during the polymerization suggests its participation in the reaction mechanism. References [1] B.M Weckhuysen R.A Schoonheydt Catal.
