DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60236-7 Preparation of Heterogeneous Mesoporous Silica-Supported 12-Tungstophosphoric Acid Catalyst and Its Catalytic Performance for Cyclopentene Oxidation YUAN Chengyuan 1,2 , CHEN Jing 1, * 1 State Key Laboratory for Oxo Synthesis and Selective Oxidation, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, China 2 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China Abstract: Keggin-structured 12-tungstophosphoric acids were immobilized onto the surface of amine-modified mesoporous sieve SBA-15 as onium salts. All the catalyst materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for their structural integrity and physicochemical properties. Charac- terization of the catalysts confirmed an ordered hexagonal mesostructure for SBA-15 and that the Keggin structure of the heteropolyanions on the amine-modified SBA-15 was preserved. The catalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated for the liquid-phase oxidation of cyclopentene with 50% hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in tert-butanol. A 100% conversion of cyclopentene and an 81% selectivity for glutaraldehyde were obtained and these were higher than that for the catalysts prepared by direct impregnation. The stability and reusability of the catalysts were studied and the catalysts could be reused at least five times, which indicates their excellent reusability. The influence of reaction temperature and reaction time was also investigated. In addition, a reaction mechanism was proposed. Key words: heteropolyacid; cyclopentene; glutaraldehyde; selective oxidation; SBA-15. Glutaraldehyde (GA) has been extensively used as an ex- cellent agent for tanning, gelling, and protein crosslinking as well as a highly effective disinfector in many fields. However, traditional industrial production methods for GA employ ex- pensive propanal and vinyl ethyl ether as raw materials [1,2], which results in a high price for GA and restricts its wide practical use. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a new, cheap, and environmentally benign production process for GA from both an economic and an environmental standpoint. An attractive way to produce GA is a one-step route by the selec- tive oxidation of cyclopentene (CPE) with aqueous H 2 O 2 as the oxidant. A large amount of CPE can easily be obtained by the selective hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene (CPD), which is the main by-product of the five-carbon fraction in the petro- chemical industry [3]. H 2 O 2 , as a terminal oxidant, is the pre- ferred option since it is cheap and only produces water as a by-product. Over the last decade, many reports have been published on the selective oxidation of CPE to GA based on tung- sten-containing catalysts. Several tungsten-containing homo- geneous catalysts have been reported as efficient catalysts for the selective oxidation of CPE to GA [4â€“7]. However, the difficult separation and recovery of the catalysts from the re- action mixture in a homogeneous system makes them imprac- tical for GA production in industry. Therefore, designing new tungsten-containing heterogeneous catalysts is considered to be one of the most promising approaches. Recently, various tungsten-containing heterogeneous catalysts such as WO 3 /TiO 2 , WO 3 /SiO 2 , W-MCM-41, W-HMS, and W-MCM-48 [8â€“16] have been used for the selective oxidation of CPE to GA. Moreover, all their work indicates that a large surface area and a uniform pore size in the support is beneficial for improved catalytic performance during GA production. Keggin type 12-tungstophosphoric heteropolyacids (HPW) YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1191â€“1198 with the molecular formula H 3 PW 12 O 40 are significant catalytic materials because of their unique properties such as strong BrÃ¶nsted acidity, high proton mobility, high thermal stability, and environmental friendliness [17â€“20]. They have been widely studied and used as efficient catalysts for a variety of organic oxidation reactions [21,22]. However, the major drawbacks of the bulk HPW catalysts such as extremely low surface area, difficult separation, and water-solubility always limit their practical applications [23]. Heterogenization of HPW is an easy method of increasing its surface area and facilitating catalyst separation as well as recycling by attaching HPW to supports such as amorphous silica, active carbon, and molecular sieves [24]. Since the discovery of MCM-41 by the Mobil company [25,26], various new mesoporous molecular sieves have been successively synthesized. Among them, SBA-15 is very inter- esting because it has a large surface area (> 800 m 2 /g) allowing for the dispersion of a large number of active sites. Further- more, the large pore size (6â€“8 nm) facilitates the diffusion of substrates and products [27]. To the best of our knowledge, no report exists about the use of heterogenized HPW, which may show excellent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of CPE to GA in aqueous H 2 O 2 systems. Therefore, in this work we successfully heterogenized HPW by grafting heteropolyanions (PW â€“ ) onto amine functionalized SBA-15. The catalyst showed very high activity and selectivity toward the selective oxidation of CPE to GA (Scheme 1). The conversion of CPE was 100% and the selectivity for GA exceeded 80%. Moreover, the catalyst could be recycled multiple times without a notable degradation in catalytic performance. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation 1.1.1 Synthesis of SBA-15 Pure siliceous SBA-15 was prepared according to the re- ported method [27]. In detail, 4.0 g Pluronic P123 was dis- solved in 150 g of a 1.6 mol/L HCl solution. Then, 8.50 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added. The resulting mix- ture was stirred at 40 Â°C for 24 h and then aged at 100 Â°C for 48 h. The solid product was filtered and dried in an oven for 6 h at 100 Â°C. To completely remove the organic template the as- synthesized product was subsequently calcined at 550 Â°C for 6 h in air. 1.1.2 Preparation of amine-modified SBA-15 The preparation of amine-modified SBA-15 was carried out as follows. 2 g of SBA-15 was dispersed in 50 ml of dry tolu- ene and to this suspension 2 g of 3-aminopropyltriehoxysilane (APTES) was added. The resulting mixture was refluxed at 110 Â°C under the protection of argon for 20 h. The solid was sepa- rated by filtration and washed in a Soxhlet apparatus with dichloromethane over 24 h and then dried in vacuum at 60 Â°C for 12 h. The obtained sample was designated NH 2 -SBA-15. 1.1.3 Immobilization of the tungstophosphoric heteropolyacid on NH 2 -SBA-15 To increase the loading of PW â€“ , NH 2 -SBA-15 was initially treated with triflic acid so that PW â€“ could be strongly anchored to the positively charged NH 3 + groups on the support through electrostatic binding. A typical procedure was as follows: triflic acid was added to NH 2 -SBA-15 in acetonitrile, refluxed at 81 Â°C for 5 h and then filtered to obtain the acidified NH 2 - SBA-15, which was designated NH 3 + -SBA-15. The supported Keggin PW â€“ catalyst was designated PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 and was prepared by adding 0.7 g of NH 3 + -SBA-15 into a 50 ml methanol solution containing 0.3 g of HPW. After refluxing at 65 Â°C for 5 h the mixture was filtered to obtain a solid product. It was then fully washed with methanol to ensure good removal of physically adsorbed HPW and then dried at 100 Â°C over- PW 3 PW 3 OOO OOO Si NH 3 + OOO Si NH 3 + OOO Si NH 3 + Si NH 3 + OOO Si NH 3 + OOO Si NH 3 + OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH H 2 O 2 + O O +H 2 O SBA-15 Scheme 1.

YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1191â€“1198 night. 1.2 Characterization of the catalysts X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips Xâ€™pert Pro diffractometer with Cu K Ä® radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. N 2 physisorption was evaluated on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 sorptometer using liquid nitrogen at â€“196 o C. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were carried out using a Bruker IFS 120HR FT-IR spectrometer and KBr pel- lets. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) data were obtained using a Diamond TG/DTA/DSC thermal analyzer. All the samples were heated at 10 Â°C/min in a nitrogen flow of 200 ml/min from room temperature to 950 Â°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were acquired using a VG ESCALAB210 XPS spectrometer with a monochromatized Mg K Ä® X-ray source. 1.3 Catalytic activity during CPE oxidation The catalytic activity test during CPE oxidation was per- formed at 35 Â°C over 24 h with vigorous stirring in a closed 50 ml regular glass reactor using 50% aqueous H 2 O 2 as the oxi- dant and tert-butanol (t-BuOH) as the solvent. In a typical experiment, a mixture of 8 ml of t-BuOH, 2.3 ml of 50% aqueous H 2 O 2 (40 mmol), and 0.1 g of PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and then 1.76 ml of cyclopentene (20 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was then stirred vigorously for 24 h at 35 Â°C. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged to separate the catalyst. The liquid was treated with MnO 2 to remove the residual H 2 O 2 and dried by anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 . A qualitative analysis of the oxidation products was conducted using an HP 6890/5973 GC-MS and a quantitative analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6820 GC equipped with an FID detector while n-dodecane was used as an internal standard. For recycling, the catalyst was washed 5 times with ethanol and then dried at 100 Â°C for 12 h. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization 2.1.1 Crystalline phase properties The XRD patterns of SBA-15, NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of pristine SBA-15 is characteristic of mesoporous SBA-15 and exhibits three well-resolved diffraction peaks in the 2È™ range from 0.7Â°â€“5Â°, and this was indexed as a hexagonal cell with (100), (110), and (200) [27]. After the surface modification, the NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 peaks were still observed indicating that the hexagonal symmetry of SBA-15 was preserved. Compared with pure SBA-15, the intensity of the reflections of the (100) peaks of NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 decreased significantly indicating a loss of long-range ordering in the structure, which could be mainly attributed to the effect of pore-filling by or- ganic APTES and the PW â€“ cluster that reduced the X-ray scattering contrast between the framework of the SBA-15 and the pores [28,29]. This result is in agreement with previous reports on HPW supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 [30,31]. Furthermore, compared with the parent SBA-15 the (100) peaks of NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 shift to lower angles implying an increasing tendency of the interplanar crystal spacing d 100 and the lattice constant a 0 (Ta- ble 1) because of the expansion of the hexagonal unit cell induced by the supported APTES and PW â€“ [32]. The XRD pattern of PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 (Fig. 1, inset) in the higher 2È™ region shows a broad diffraction peak at about 23Â°, which can be assigned to amorphous silica. In addition, no PW â€“ peaks were found suggesting that a high degree of PW â€“ dispersion Table 1 Nitrogen physisorption parameters and unit cell dimensions of the samples Sample BET surface area (m 2 /g) Pore volume (cm 3 /g) Pore diameter (nm) d 100 /nm a 0 /nm Pore wall thickness (nm) SBA-15 595 1.10 7.10 9.54 11.02 3.92 NH 2 -SBA-15 336 0.68 6.82 9.79 11.30 4.48 NH 3 + -SBA-15 246 0.54 6.58 10.09 11.65 5.07 PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 168 0.37 6.34 9.98 11.53 5.19 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 2T/( o ) (4) (3) (2) (1) (100) (200) (110) I n t e n s i t y Fig. 1.

For all the samples the isotherms are of type IV with a clear type HI hysteresis loop, which is typical of the highly organized hexagonal mesostructures [33]. The isotherm shows a sharp inflection between 0.5 and 0.8 p/p 0 because of capillary condensation in the mesopores. The sharpness of this step implies a uniform and narrow pore size. Furthermore, the supported APTES and PW â€“ results in a marked change in the shape of the hysteresis loop suggesting a less ordered and uniform structure, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. From the pore size distribution curves, it can be shown clearly that in contrast to SBA-15 the curves that correspond to NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 gradu- ally shift towards the smaller diameter region. This can be attributed to the loading of APTES and PW â€“ over SBA-15 resulting in the blocking of pores. The nitrogen physisorption parameters of the samples are shown in Table 1. Pure SBA-15 possesses a high specific sur- face area of 595 m 2 /g and a pore volume of 1.10 cm 3 /g. After modification by APTES the surface area and pore volume of NH 2 -SBA-15 drops drastically to 336 m 2 /g and 0.68 cm 3 /g, respectively, which is attributed to the occupation of pores by the organic components. By loading PW â€“ onto NH 2 -SBA-15 the surface area and pore volume of PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 further decreases to 168 m 2 /g and 0.37 cm 3 /g, respectively, and this is due to the immobilization of PW â€“ . In addition, the pore wall thickness of SBA-15, NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 increases remarkably from 3.92 to 5.19 nm. The change in pore wall thickness of the four samples confirms the results from Fig. 2(b) wherein the pore size de- creased after the introduction of APTES and PW â€“ to the pore channel of SBA-15. 2.1.3 FT-IR analysis The successful immobilization of PW - can also be confirmed by FT-IR analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. For SBA-15, NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15, the bands at 1630 cm â€“1 can be assigned to the OH vibration of physisorbed H 2 O. The Siâ€“Oâ€“Si bands originate from SBA-15 and were observed around 1085, 800, and 462 cm â€“1 . The Keg- gin PW sample showed four characteristic bands at 1080 cm â€“1 (P=O), 982 cm â€“1 (W=O), 892 cm â€“1 (Wâ€“Oâ€“W), and 793 cm â€“1 (Wâ€“Oâ€“W) [34]. Most of the characteristic bands of PW were not clearly identified because of the broad Siâ€“Oâ€“Si band overlap [35]. Therefore, these bands are not clearly visible in the IR spectrum of PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15.

YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1191â€“1198 in the intensity of the IR bands at 1085, 800, and 462 cm â€“1 in PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 compared with NH 3 + -SBA-15 may be considered to be proof for the presence of PW â€“ in the channels of NH 3 + -SBA-15 [31]. 2.1.4 Thermal decomposition analysis Figure 4 shows the TG curves that were obtained in nitrogen for HPW, SBA-15, NH 2 -SBA-15, NH 3 + -SBA-15, and PW â€“ - NH 3 + -SBA-15. Figure 4(5) shows that physically adsorbed and crystal water from HPW were removed between 25â€“100 Â°C and 100â€“250 Â°C, respectively, and between 250â€“500 Â°C HPW began to decompose. For SBA-15 (Fig. 4(1)), the first mass loss step below 100 Â°C was due to the removal of physically adsorbed water, the second mass loss step between 100â€“430 Â°C was caused by the desorption of water and the decomposition of residual surfactant from within the pores, and the mass loss above 700 Â°C was the result of surface silanol condensation to form siloxane [36]. In contrast with SBA-15, the TG curve of NH 2 -SBA-15 (Fig. 4(2)) gave a mass loss process with a total mass loss of 10% between 400â€“700 Â°C, which could be attrib- uted to the decomposition of APTES indicating that APTES was grafted onto SBA-15. The mass loss of about 2% between 700â€“900 Â°C for NH 2 -SBA-15 is due to the loss of adsorbed water molecules from the condensation of the silanol group on the surface of NH 2 -SBA-15. Compared with triflic NH 2 -SBA-15, a higher mass loss of about 18% was found for NH 3 + -SBA-15 (Fig. 4(3)) between 400â€“700 Â°C, which can be explained by the presence of triflic acid on the surface of NH 3 + -SBA-15. Furthermore, from Fig. 4(4) the mass loss rate for PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 between 400â€“700 Â°C is lower than that of NH 2 -SBA-15 and NH 3 + -SBA-15, and the total mass loss decreases to 10%, which is due to the simultaneous decompo- sition of PW â€“ and APTES from 400â€“700 Â°C but the decompo- sition rate of PW â€“ is lower than that of APTES indicating the presence of PW â€“ in the SBA-15 channels. 2.1.5 XPS XPS was used to analyze the surface chemical composition of the catalysts. Data from XPS measurements for NH 3 + -SBA-15 and PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 are shown in Fig. 5. The atomic concentrations according to a quantitative analysis calculation are listed in Table 2. XPS wide-scan spectra (Fig. 5(a)) show that the surface of NH 3 + -SBA-15 consists mainly of C, N, O, and Si. It is worth noting that PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 exhibits an obvious W signal at a binding energy of 35.8 eV, confirming the successful anchoring of PW â€“ to the surface of SBA-15. In addition, from Fig. 5(b) the N 1s band for NH 3 + -SBA-15 can be deconvoluted into three main contribu- tions (at 405.2, 401.9, and 399.7 eV, respectively) by the curve fitting procedure. However, the N 1s band can be deconvoluted into two main contributions for PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 (at 402.2 and 400.2 eV, respectively), and this is possibly due to a change 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 75 80 85 90 95 100 Temperature ( o C) M a s s ( % ) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Fig. 4.

YUAN Chengyuan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1191â€“1198 in the coordination environment of nitrogen in PW â€“ -NH 3 + - SBA-15. Therefore, this distinction can be seen as further evidence for the successful anchoring of PW â€“ onto the surface of SBA-15. 2.2 Catalytic performance The results of CPE oxidation with hydrogen peroxide over different catalysts are listed in Table 3. According to the results of GC-MS analysis, besides obtaining GA as the main product, a variety of by-products such as cyclopentene oxide (CPO), cyclopentan-1,2-diol (CPD), and 2-butoxyl-1-cyclopenta- nediol (BCPD) were found. From Table 3 it is obvious that no transformation of CPE to GA took place without a catalyst. A similar result was also obtained for NH 3 + -SBA-15. The catalyst PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic performance. The highest CPE conversion and GA selectivity was 100% and 81%, respectively, and these results are better than those ob- tained over WO 3 /SiO 2 [37], W-MCM-41 [10], W-MCM-48 [13] and W-HMS [11], as reported previously. 2.2.1 Effect of reaction temperature The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic per- formance of PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 is shown in Fig. 6. The results suggest that the increase in reaction temperature from 25 to 45 Â°C led to an increase in the conversion of CPE and the maxi- mum conversion of 100% was obtained when the reaction temperature exceeded 35 Â°C. The selectivity for the main product, GA, increased from 68% to 81% with an increase in the reaction temperature from 25 to 35 Â°C and it decreased with a further increase in the reaction temperature, and this is due to an increase in the number of side reactions with an increase in the reaction temperature. For the by-products, with an increase in the reaction temperature the CPD and BCPD selectivity gradually increased while the selectivity for CPO decreased and when the reaction temperature was higher than 35 Â°C no CPO was detected in the reaction mixture. Based on the above results, 35 Â°C was chosen as the optimal reaction temperature. 2.2.2 Effect of reaction time Figure 7 shows the effect of reaction time on CPE conver- sion and product distribution over PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15. CPE conversion steadily increased with an increase in the reaction time and it reached the maximum value of 100% after 24 h and then remained stable. GA selectivity reached a maximum of 80% after 24 h and it then decreased slightly with a further increase in reaction time. The selectivities for CPD and BCPD increased slowly as the reaction time increased while the se- lectivity for CPO decreased sharply during the initial 12 h and thereafter the amount of CPO present was small. Based on the results of conversion and selectivity, 24 h was selected as the 25 30 35 40 45 0 20 40 60 80 100 X(CPE) S(CPO) S(GA) S(CPD) S(BCPD) Reaction temperature ( o C) C o n v e r s i o n a n d s e l e c t i v i t y ( % ) Fig. 6.

After each reaction run the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed several times with water and ethanol and then the catalyst was dried at 100 Â°C for 12 h to remove water and ethanol. The catalyst was then used for the next run under the same reaction conditions. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 8. It is clear that the conversion of CPE over the recycled catalyst was slightly lower than that over the fresh catalyst after the first run and it then remained constant, which is mainly due to the loss of PW â€“ on PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 during the first run. The selec- tivity for GA decreased slowly and remained above 75% even after five cycles. In conclusion, the PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 cata- lyst shows high activity and stability for the selective oxidation of CPE to GA and it can be recycled after the reaction. 2.3 Discussion According to literature [37,38], a possible route for the oxidation of CPE to GA is as shown in Scheme 2. The oxida- tion of CPE with hydrogen peroxide starts by the epoxidation of cyclopentene to CPE oxide (Step 1). Cyclopentene oxide is not stable and can be further oxidized to hydroxylcyclopentyl hydroperoxide and then to glutaraldehyde (Step 2). Moreover, cyclopentene oxide can also hydrolyze to form 1,2-cyclopentanediol (Step 3). The by-product of BCPD for- mation can be produced by the reaction of cyclopentene oxide with t-BuOH (Step 4). Based on Scheme 2, the conversion of CPE is governed by the rate of Step 1 and the selectivity is controlled by the rate ratio of Steps 2, 3, and 4. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, with an increase in the reaction temperature or an increase in the reaction time, the conversion of CPE and the selectivity for GA increases, which indicates that a high reaction temperature or long reaction time facilitates Steps 1 and 2 in Scheme 2. Moreover, the selectivity for GA in this study is much higher than that of CPD and BCPD, which indicates that the rate of Step 2 was much faster than the rate of Steps 3 and 4. Once cyclopentene oxide forms, it converts to GA very quickly. 3 Conclusions A novel heterogeneous PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 catalyst was prepared by grafting Keggin type 12-tungstophosphoric het- eropolyanions onto amine-modified SBA-15 and it was well characterized, which revealed the structural integrity of the immobilized catalyst and the Keggin structure of the heter- opolyanions. The obtained PW â€“ -NH 3 + -SBA-15 was very active as a heterogeneous catalyst for the selective oxidation of CPE to GA using environmentally benign aqueous hydrogen per- oxide as the oxidant, and it gave a CPE conversion of 100% and a GA selectivity of 81%, respectively. The catalyst could be reused at least five times without an obvious decrease in catalytic performance suggesting its promising potential use in industry for glutaraldehyde production.

Tel: +86-931-4968068 Keggin-structured 12-tungstophosphoric acids were immobilized onto the surface of amine-modified mesoporous sieve SBA-15 as onium salts. All the catalyst materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for their structural integrity and physicochemical properties. Characterization of the catalysts confirmed an ordered hexagonal mesostructure for SBA-15 and that the Keggin structure of the heteropolyanions on the amine-modified SBA-15 was preserved. The catalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated for the liquid-phase oxidation of cyclopentene with 50% hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant in tert-butanol. A 100% conversion of cyclopentene and an 81% selectivity for glutaraldehyde were obtained and these were higher than that for the catalysts prepared by direct impregnation. The stability and reusability of the catalysts were studied and the catalysts could be reused at least five times, which indicates their excellent reusability. The influence of reaction temperature and reaction time was also investigated. In addition, a reaction mechanism was proposed.
