Poland Received 28 April 1997~ received in revised form 1 I August 1997: accepted 25 August 1997 .m Abstract Alumina displays low catalytic activity at the initial stage of the reaction of CCI2F2 with hydrogen, giving mainly halogen exchange products, and this activity quickly decays with time-on-stream. In the case of Pd/AI203 catalysts, the contribution of the support is negligible at 180C. Catalytic activity of Pd/)-AIzO3 in CC12F2 hydrodechlorination strongly depends on metal dispersion: poorly dispersed Pd samples exhibit the highest turnover frequencies. The same samples also show the highest selectivities towards the formation of CHEF2. Time-on-stream behaviour and considerable amounts of carbon found in used catalysts suggest that the catalytic properties of Pd/AIzO3 are regulated by incorporation of carbon into Pd lattice, or the formation of Pd carbide. Poorly dispersed Pd catalysts contain a higher proportion of plane atoms and, therefore, are subjected to a more severe carbiding. Such a transformation generates surfaces which bind freon molecules less strongly, resulting in higher activity and selectivity to partial dehalogenation, i.e formation of CHzF2. High-temperature reduction at 600'C does not much change the overall activity of Pd/AI203. However. the selectivity to CH2F2 is somewhat increased. It is believed that the Pd-AI203 interface changes upon high-temperature reduction, leading to a Pd-AI compound. At corrosive conditions of hydrodehalogenation of CCI2F2, the Pd-A1 would be converted to A1F, species much more easily than the A1,O3 species at the Pd-AIzO3 interface of mildly reduced Pd/AI203 catalysts, t 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The necessity of phase-out of these ozone- depleting compounds, expressed in the Montreal Pro- tocol, and the use of hydrochlorofluorcx:arbons (HCFCs) and/or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) instead of CFCs launched a more intensive work on catalytic hydrodechlorination of CFCs [1,2[. Palladium is the most extensively investigated as catalyst for the hydro- dechiorination of CFCs. Coq et al. [3.4] thoroughly studied the reaction kinetics of CCI2F~ (CFC-12) 312 W. Juszczyk et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 166 (1998) 311-319 hydrodechlorination by palladium supported on dif- ferent carriers: graphite, alumina, AIF3, ZrO2 and TiO2, ZrF4. They established, among various things, that increasing the Pd particle size from 1.5 to 8 nm in a Pd/7-AI203 catalyst results in higher hydrodechlor- ination activity [3]. However, this particle size effect seems to be overshadowed by the influence of support. At the initial stage of the reaction, Pd/AIF3 appears much more selective towards CH2F2 (a desired reac- tion, compared to CH4 formation) than Pd/A1203: however, after a prolonged reaction time, the latter catalyst acquires a similar performance as Pd/AIF~. Such a result was interpreted by Coq et al. 14] that hydrodehalogenation induces important changes in the Pd-AI203 interface: higher selectivity towards CH2F2 is favoured by the presence of electron-defi- cient Pd species, which, in turn, would be generated in the vicinity of \")-AI203 modified by fluorine (All=, species) 14]. It should be noted that in the reaction of hydrodechlorination of CFsCCI2F (CFC-114a), Pd/ AIF3 catalysts exhibit superior selectivity to CFsCH2F 15] compared to Pd/q~-Al203 [61. All these ideas appeared interesting to us so that we decided to perform studies on a series of Pd/Al203 catalysts in the reaction of hydrodechlorination of CCi2F2. The reason for undertaking this research was at least twofold. First, since the data of Coq et al. concern only two differently metal dispersed cata- lysts [3], we wished to verify the effect of Pd dis- persion, covering an entire dispersion range. Second, if the presence of electron-deficient Pd species is crucial in securing a high selectivity towards CH2F2, one is tempted to test this concept by an intentional generation of these species. Previous stu- dies showed that, after high-temperature reduction (at 600), the Pd/\"f-AI203 system partially transforms into Pd-AI (at the metal-support interface) [7,81. We assumed that, at corrosive reaction conditions caused by evolution of HE Pd-AI interactions should be destroyed, leading to a considerable fluorination of alumina species. This would mean that Pd/AI203 catalysts which passed high-temperature reduction should acquire high selectivity to CH2F2 much faster than the Pd/AI203 catalysts subjected to a low- temperature reduction (e.g. at 300~C). Also, because the reaction environment (CC12F2, HC1, HF) is expected to modify acidic properties of %-A1203 [9-12], one may ask if such changes have an effect on the overall performance of Pd/AI203 catalyst in hydrodechlorination. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts preparation and characteri=ation Five Pd/q,'-Al203 catalysts were prepared and tested. The support was '-),-AI203 (99.99%, PHF American Cyanamid, 70-120 mesh, surface area --~160m2/g. purity 99.9%). Amounts of i and 5 wt% Pd/AI203 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of ~,- AI203 with an aqueous solution of palladium chloride (analytical grade, POCh, Gliwice, Poland). To indicate a possible presence of chlorine in these catalysts, they are rnarked as I (or 5) wt% Pd(C1)/AI203. Also, 1.45 wt% Pd/AI203 was prepared by impreg- nation of ^r-A1203 with palladium acetylacetonate (99.8%, Alfa Produkte. Karlsruhe, Germany, lot # 314882112) diluted in a benzene (analytical grade, POCh, Gliwice, Poland) solution according to Boitiaux et al. [13]. The catalyst denoted as 1 wt% Pd/AI203 was pre- pared by incipient wetness impregnation of ~,-A1203 with an aqueous solution of Pal(NO3)2 (Alfa Produkte, Karlsruhe, Germany, lot # 031480812). Next, 0.39 wt% Pd/A1203 was prepared by ion exchange of 3-A1203 with Pd(NH3)~- ions using an aqueous solution of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Produkte, Karlsruhe, Germany, lot # 031482109) at pH = 9.6- 10 and room temperature, according to the description given by Sivaraj et al. [141. All solids, after subsequent drying in air oven at 80~C for 2 h, were transferred to glass-stoppered bottles and kept in a desiccator. The standard pretreatment of catalysts was as fol- lows. First, the catalysts were precalcined in flowing 5% O2/He (25 ml/min), while being heated at a rate of 4~C/min to 500\"C. Next, after cooling down the reactor to room temperature and a short purge with helium, the samples were reduced in flowing 10% H2/ He (25 ml/min), in a temperature-programmed regime (SC/min) from 20 to 30ffC and held at this tem- perature for 1 h. A few experiments were performed on the samples which were screened after the standard pretreatment. In such cases, samples were reoxidized W.

Metal dispersion measured by hydrogen chemisorption at 70:C by a pulse method after various catalyst pretreatments are shown in Table 1. 2.2. Catalytic experiments The reaction of dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12 from Galco S.A., Belgium, purity 99.9%) with dihy- drogen (purified by passing over MnO/SiO2) was conducted in a glass flow system under atmospheric pressure at 140-250. Feed partial pressures were 15 and 150 Ton\" (1 Torr -- 133.3 N m-z) of dichlorodi- fluoromethane and hydrogen, respectively, in a helium carrier (also purified by MnO/SiO2). The flow of all gases was metered by MKS mass-fow controllers and the overall flow rate of the reactant gas mixture was 100 ml/min. The reaction mixture leaving the reactor was introduced via stainless steel tubing onto a gas chromatograph (HP 5890 series II with FID) and analyzed using a 5% Fiuorcol/Carbopack B column (10 ft) from Supelco. The results of GC analysis were elaborated using HP Chemstation. Turnover frequen- cies (TOFs) were calculated on the basis of the Pd dispersion values (H/Pd) shown in Table 1. In order to adequately establish changes in a cata- lytic behaviour, a typical reaction run lasted --,24 h. The first period of reaction involved a 20 h passivation at 180':C. During this time, a catalyst was stabilized in a flow of the reaction mixture. Analyses of the reacting gas were made in 30-minute intervals. After achieving stable conversions and product distributions, i.e. after \",-20 h of time-on-stream, the reaction temperature was being changed and experimental points collected. To avoid secondary reactions, the overall conversion was kept low, i.e. generally at < 5%. We checked that over the series of our catalysts, in the conversion range 0-5%, the extent of conversion was proportional to the contact time, suggesting differentiality of the reactor. The absence of diffusional limitations was verified by experiments with gradually more finely crushed cata- lysts. Such tests showed no effect of the catalyst grain size on the percent conversion and product selectivity. 3. Results and discussion Alumina-supported catalysts seemed to us an inter- esting subject of investigation because alumina itself catalyses various dismutation and halogen exchange reactions [151. Ct~ et al. 13] established that the 314 V~ Juszczyk et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 166 (1998) 311-319 reaction of hydrodechlorination proceeds on palla- dium atoms. Some of these atoms were thought to be modified by the presence of AIF~ species, located at the Pd/7-AI203 interface. If some sites of alumina played an important role in hydrodechlorination, their action would be changed alter activating the catalyst by high-temperature pretreatment. After high-tem- perature pretreatment, alumina acquires some extra Lewis acidity [16]. Theretore, to evaluate the activity of supported Pd catalysts, it was necessary to recog- nize the contribution from the carrier, especially in the case of highly reduced Pd/AI-,O3 samples. It appeared that after reduction at 30ffC. alumina exhibits negli- gible activity, when the reaction is carried out at 180~C (standard temperature of catalyst screening). Above 180, especially at 250\"~C, however, alumina shows rather high activity, directed to CCIF~ formation. It appears that chlorine extraction from the CC12F2 molecule, and F atom introduction therein, is an easy process on activated A1203. a b 4 J 4 . \" ='3 3~ c 2 ~ , I ] II c - i ...... 1- - o ...... 3 2004c000'~ 0 7'O0~~6008001:x'~C Time-on-stream rain Tlrne-on-sttearn m,n : .- ~ - -- - ~ 0 o .~po . t .... v 2~4C06~80C'000 o 2004006C, O80017\"C7 c ~.\"~6oc8c0~3~ Time-on-stream. rain Trne.o~-slream rain Time.off.stream. rnln Fig. 1.

Time-on-stream behaviour As mentioned above, after reduction at 300~'C, \"I- AI203 support exhibits some, although low, activity in the reaction at 180~C. This activity decreases with time-on-stream. Initial products are: CCIF3, CHEF2, CH4, ethane and ethene. After some time-on-stream. CH2F2 predominates among the products, however, the overall activity is extremely low. After reduction at 600:C for 17 h, the overall activity increases by an order of magnitude; nevertheless, it is still insignif- icant compared to the activity level exhibited by all Pd/~,-AI203 samples. Now, CC1F3 predominates (> 90% of products), and, again, the activity drops down in time. Deactivation of \"t-A1203 is probably caused by deposition of carbonaceous residues which cannot be removed without providing active hydrogen in the absence of palladium. Higher reaction tempera- tures, up to 250~'C, increase halogen exchange, noticed by a vast production of CCIF3. All these changes may influence the initial stage of the time-on-stream behaviour of Pd/AI203 catalysts. Coq et al. studied hydrodechlorination of CCIeF2 by different Pd catalysts [3,4]. During the passivation period (i.e. the time needed for stable catalytic beha- viour), alumina-supported Pd catalysts suffered a 20- 50% activity loss. In our case, low metal dispersed samples also showed a similar behaviour (Fig. la): however, in the case of well-dispersed samples the situation was different. Either some activity enhance- ment took place (Fig. Ib) or after an initial abrupt drop. a slow buildup of activity was observed (Fig. ic). These differences in passivation periods are hardly explicable, different factors could be con- sidered. Selectivity changes are more clear and similar to those reported by Coq et al. [3 ], i.e. the selectivity towards CH2F2 generally increases at the expense of methane formation (Fig. l(a--c)). The low metal dis- persed Pd/AI203 catalyst prepared from Pd nitrate showed the highest activity (TOF) and selectivity towards CH2F2 (,~70%). 3.2. Effect of Pd di,wersion on activity attd selectivity Alter low-temperature reduction (at 300 C), the Pd/ AI203 characterized by the poorest dispersion (ex- Pd(NO3)2, Table 1) exhibited the highest overall activ- ity (TOF) and selectivity for CH2F2, --~70% (Table 2 and Fig. ia). This selectivity level is somewhat lower than that obtained by Coq et al. [3]; however, one must consider that those data concern higher CC12FjH2 ratio (0.35 vs. 0.1 in our case). An excess of hydrogen in a reaction mixture would possibly lead to higher W.

Reaction conditions: 180C, CC12F2/I-t, ratio = 0.1. for highly reduced catalysts are only insignificantly higher compared to those after reduction at 30OC, and, consequently, have been considered in construct- ing the common curve. The insert in Fig. 2 shows the data taken from Coq et al. [3]. The relation between the selectivity to CH2F2 vs. Pd dispersion (Fig. 3) is not so straightforward as the previous relation. Here, two courses represent data for differently reduced catalysts; highly reduced samples are somewhat more selective to CHzF2 than the cata- lysts reduced at 300. It should be mentioned, that. in 13], two differently dispersed Pd/AI203 catalysts showed similar, high selectivities, approaching 80%. The difference in reaction conditions used in both works (described in caption to Fig. 2) would be responsible for this apparent controversy. Higher passivation temperature (200:C) and higher CCI2F2 partial pressure used in Ref. [31 would lead to more extensive modification of Pd/AlzO3 catalysts. Coq et al. suggested that during passivation period fluoride species modify the Pd-AI203 interface, lead- ing to Pd-AIFx, where x < 3 [4]. Such a transformation should induce electron deficiency in Pd atoms located in the vicinity to the support. Electron-deficient Pd species should bind: CF2 radicals less strongly, and, in effect, produce a higher selectivity to CHzF2. We agree with such a suggestion; however, another phe- nomenon should also be considered. Poorly dispersed Pd/AI203 catalysts, which are characterized by a lower dimension of metal-support interface, are more active and selective to CH2F2. In addition, a considerable decrease in selectivity towards methane at the initial stage of the reaction suggests that the CCI2F2 mole- cule may be completely stripped off from halogens before being desorbed as methane. C~ ad-units can be hydrogenated off (and desorbed as CH4) or may diffuse into the palladium lattice. Carbiding Pd cata- lysts during hydrocarbon and CO hydrogenation reac- tions is a well-recognized phenomenon 117-19]. A slower buildup of the selectivity to CH2F2 in the case of poorly dispersed samples may follow from the fact that bulky Pd particles constitute a more capacious sink for carbon than small Pd particles in highly dispersed catalysts. In addition, larger Pd crystallites contain higher proportion of surface plane sites, which should bind C~ species more strongly than highly unsaturated surface sites of lower coordination, like corners or edges [20]. We suggest that carbided Pd plane surfaces are sites of high selectivity towards CH2F2. Our explanation does not rule out the concept proposed by Coq et al. [4], who gave more attention to the importance of active sites at the metal-support W. JuszcD'k et a/./Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 311-319 317 interface. We would only like to rationalize the fact that the larger Pd particles, which exhibit a lesser extent of metal-support interface, are more active and selective in CH2F2 formation. We shall return to the concept of Coq et al. in the next subsection. Recent XRD study of van de Sandt et al. substan- tiated Pd carbide formation during the reaction of hydrodechlorination of CCI:,F2 over 2 and 3 wt% Pd/carbon [21] and Pd black catalyst 122]. Our low metal dispersed, l wt% Pd/AI203 also displayed a partial transformation of Pd into Pd carbide (Fig. 4a). a 1oooo F 9000 I( PdC= = , Pd oOO, 60o01 .... ,. .., .... , .,. .... ,~ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 2 theta, deg. b 3e-9 -r- ~ Mass 15 2e-9 ll ~ le-9 0e+0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Temperature, deg.C Fig. 4.

The difference diffractogram was obtained by subtraction of the '~,-AI203 'back- ground\" from the XRD profile from 1 wt% Pd/AI203 (CuK,, radiation). (b) Methane evolution during temperature-programmed reduction of spent 5 wt% Pd(CI)/AI203 catalyst. Mass 15 was selected for presentation, because methane liberation observed by monitoring mass 16 is somewhat misrepresented due to evolution of water. However, the XRD study of spent 5 wt% Pd(C1)/ A1203 catalysts did not show any noticeable changes in the catalyst structure. It must be mentioned that the XRD observation of a palladium phase in Pd/3-AI203 catalysts is very difficult because of overlapping reflections from Pd and \"7-A1203 [23]. Relatively high metal dispersion in the 5 wt% Pd(CI) catalyst (H/ Pd = 0.45) makes detection of the phase transforma- tion of Pd even more difficult. However, the tempera- ture-programmed reduction (TPR) of spent 5 wt% Pd(CI)/Ai203 revealed a massive liberation of methane, with a maximum of evolution rate at ,~200:C (Fig. 4b). During TPR, up to 500~C, HF evolution was not observed. An independent study showed that 'regeneration' of spent Pd/AI203 catalyst by reduction in H2 at 250>C for 30 min, returns its initial catalytic behaviour (increase in overall activity and selectivity to CH4), but, after 2 h of time-on- stream, the steady-state performance is restored [24]. Fig. 5 shows separate TOF values for CH2F2 and CH4 formation as a function of Pd dispersion. The activity towards CH2F2 sharply decreases with increase of metal dispersion. As already mentioned, such a relation may be explained by lower proportion of plane atoms in highly dispersed catalysts. Also, Pd planes seemed to be more drastically modified by surface carbiding, becoming efficient in a partial 002 1 J G 'l/) O.Ol i )- 000 \"F -- ~-' 0.0 02 04 06 08 1D Pd dispersion, H/Pd Fig. 5.

On the other hand, the rate of methane formation only slightly decreases with increasing Pd dispersion. Although it is known that the rate of CO methanation increases with decreasing Pd dispersion [25], this effect may somewhat be flattened by the fact that a majority of carbided plane atoms (in poorly dispersed samples) are involved in a more facile reaction of CCI2F2 to CHzF2. It must be noticed that the activation energy to CH2F2 is lower than that Ibr CHa lbrmation, as can be judged from selectivity changes with temperature (Table 2). 3.3. Catalytic activity as a function of catalyst pretreatment As mentioned in the previous subsection, the pre- sence or absence of chloride in the catalyst precursor does not have any special effect on the final catalytic behaviour of Pd/AI-,O3 catalysts. Palladium dispersion seems to play a decisive role (Fig. 2). However, the prolonged high-temperature reduction at 600':C insig- nificantly increases the overall activity (triangles in Fig. 2). Much larger changes are seen in selectivity (Fig. 3), where highly reduced catalysts exhibit higher selectivities towards CH2F2. This difference is marked for samples showing higher metal dispersions. Our first speculation was that the high-temperature pre- treatment (reduction at 600 C for 17 h) results in some changes in the pore structure of \"t-A1203, namely, the number of small pores would diminish, as in another work [26]. In the case of low dispersed catalysts, such modification should not have any effect on the selec- tivity, because very large Pd particles (>>10nm) cannot fit narrower pores of PHF \"),-Al.._O3 (average pore diameter 12 nm, [27]) and are located on the external surface of the support. However, when Pd particles become smaller, their presence in pores is more likely. If it is so, then the pore size may be important for the selectivity control, i.e. wider pores, higher selectivity to a partial hydrogenation of CCI~F2 and slightly higher overall activity. However, such a speculation must be rejected because of several rea- sons. First, as mentioned in Section 2, preliminary kinetic experiments ruled out any objections as to mass transfer limitations. Second, apparent activation energies exhibit typical values for hydrodechlorina- tion of CC12F2, i.e. 60-74 kJ/mol (Table 2 vs. data from [3,4]). Finally, the pore structure of the 1 wt% Pd(CI)/AI203, which showed the largest changes in selectivity to CH2F2 induced by high-temperature reduction (Fig. 3), was inspected by using argon adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. The course of adsorption isotherms (not shown) was identical in the case of the samples reduced at 300 and 600 C, demonstrating no essential changes in the pore struc- ture and surface area of the I wt% Pd(CI)/\"t-AI203 catalyst. As mentioned earlier, Coq et al. 14] suggested that higher selectivity towards CH2F2 may be effected by the presence of an electron-deficient Pd species. which, in turn, would be generated in a close proxi- mity of \")'-A!203 modified by fluorine or AIF., species. It seems logical that such a selectivity enhancement must be more distinct for highly dispersed Pd catalysts (of larger metal-support interface). As was shown in the previous subsection, this is not the case for Pd/ A1203 prereduced at 300C (Fig. 3, the lower line constructed by joining the squares). Accordingly, such a catalytic behaviour has been interpreted in terms of possible changes in the bulk of Pd crystallites, i.e. by invoking Pd carbide formation. However, because the reduction at 600C causes larger changes in the selec- tivity to CH2F2 for samples exhibiting higher Pd dispersions (Fig. 3), we think that now the presencc of AIFx species at the Pd-AI203 interface is mani- fested. Earlier works showed that, after high-tempera- ture reduction (at 600:C), the Pd/^t-Al203 system transforms partially into a Pd-A1 alloy [7,81. It seems that, at corrosive reaction conditions caused by evolu- tion of HF, Pd-AI interactions are destroyed, leading to a considerable fluorination of alumina species. In effect, Pd/AI203 catalysts which passed high-tempera- ture reduction acquire higher selectivity to CH2F2 much faster than the Pd/AI203 catalysts subjected to a low-temperature reduction (e.g. at 300 C). To sum up, we conclude that the behaviour of -'.- AI203 supported palladium catalysts in CCI2F2 hydro- dechlorination greatly depends on Pd dispersion. Larger Pd particles are more easily transtbrmed into Pd carbide and are more active and selective towards CH2F2. On the other hand, the importance of AIF, species [4] is manifested for Pd/AI203 prereduced at 600~C. Now. the metal-support interface of highly dispersed Pd/A1203 starts to play an important role: AlE, species induce the electron-deficient Pd species, IV.

In the case of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, the contribution of the support is negligible at 180°C. Catalytic activity of Pd/γ-Al2O3 in CCl2F2 hydrodechlorination strongly depends on metal dispersion: poorly dispersed Pd samples exhibit the highest turnover frequencies. The same samples also show the highest selectivities towards the formation of CH2F2. Time-on-stream behaviour and considerable amounts of carbon found in used catalysts suggest that the catalytic properties of Pd/Al2O3 are regulated by incorporation of carbon into Pd lattice, or the formation of Pd carbide. Poorly dispersed Pd catalysts contain a higher proportion of plane atoms and, therefore, are subjected to a more severe carbiding. Such a transformation generates surfaces which bind freon molecules less strongly, resulting in higher activity and selectivity to partial dehalogenation, i.e formation of CH2F2. High-temperature reduction at 600°C does not much change the overall activity of Pd/Al2O3. However, the selectivity to CH2F2 is somewhat increased. It is believed that the PdAl2O3 interface changes upon high-temperature reduction, leading to a PdAl compound. At corrosive conditions of hydrodehalogenation of CCl2F2, the PdAl would be converted to AlF x species much more easily than the Al2O3 species at the PdAl2O3 interface of mildly reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalysts.
