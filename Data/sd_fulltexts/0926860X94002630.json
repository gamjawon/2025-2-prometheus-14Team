Hadden, P.J. Lambert, C. Ranson ICI Katalco, P.O. Box 1, Billingham, Cleveland TS23 ILB, UK Received 14 October 1994; revised 22 November 1994; accepted 22 November 1994 Abstract The catalytic activities and copper metal surface areas of CuO/ZnO/AI203 water-gas shift catalysts have been determined. There is no single function which can describe the relationship between the copper metal area and the activity of every catalyst. However, discrete copper area-activity relation- ships are evident within groups of catalysts whose precursor species were formed under identical preparation conditions. Within these groups simple, linear, area-activity relationships are discovered. Keywords: Copper; Surface area; Water-gas shift CuO/ZnO/A1203 catalysts are central to the production of a number of important chemical building blocks such as ammonia (in which the water-gas shift reaction is used to remove carbon monoxide upstream of the ammonia synthesis reactor) and methanol (in which a copper catalyst facilitates the synthesis reaction). In consequence, the CuO/ZnO/A1203 catalyst system has been subjected to consid- erable study in both academic and industrial research laboratories. For example, a number of investigations have probed the relationship between the methanol syn- thesis activity and the metallic copper surface area of these types of catalysts [ 1- 5]. In a number of these studies [ 1,2,5 ] it has been reported that the activity of CuO/ZnO/AI203 catalysts is linearly dependent upon the surface area of the reduced copper component of the catalyst as measured by a nitrous oxide decom- position technique. In classical catalysis terminology methanol synthesis catalysts which contain a CuO/ZnO component could therefore be described as being 'insen- sitive' with respect to copper crystallite size and shape. In contrast to methanol synthesis catalysts the published data concerning the relationship between the copper surface area and the activity of CuO/ZnO water- 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hadden et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) LI-L4 gas shift catalysts generates little confidence in the existence of any direct corre- lation between these two parameters. For example, one study [ 5 ] revealed clear evidence for the absence of any relationship between the copper surface area and shift activity of CuO/ZnO catalysts. The authors of this study concluded that the shift activity was influenced by a number of catalyst parameters which included the nature and amount of adsorbed oxygen, the presence of alkali impurities and the copper crystal face and morphology. We have carried out a detailed investigation of the dependence of the water-gas shift activity of a range of carefully prepared CuO/ZnO/A1203 materials on the copper surface area of these catalysts. The results of this study reveal that the activity of CuO/ZnO/A1203 catalysts can be closely correlated with the copper surface area, as measured by nitrous oxide decomposi- tion, if a number of factors are precisely controlled. These factors, which include the catalyst precipitation and ageing conditions and which may involve the min- eralogy of the crystalline precursor complexes which are formed by these processes, appear to explain some of the apparent 'sensitivity' which is evident in CuO/ZnO/ A1203 water-gas shift catalysts. The catalysts which are described in this letter were prepared by precipitation from the mixing of copper, zinc and aluminium nitrate solutions with sodium carbonate solution. A first series of catalysts, which consisted of twelve separately prepared samples, was prepared by carrying out the precipitation at a pH of 6.8 and at a temperature of 70. Although identical process conditions were used for each of the preparations, slightly different ratios of copper, zinc and aluminium were utilised in each of the catalysts. This first series of preparations therefore resulted in the production of catalysts which had copper contents, in the final reduced state, in the range of 38 wt.-%-54 wt.-%. These catalysts will be described as being prepared by method 'A'. A second series of 7 catalysts was also prepared under carefully controlled conditions. However, in this second set of preparations a pre- cipitation pH of 6.5 and a temperature of 65 were utilised and a number of other precipitation and ageing conditions were also varied with respect to those used in the first set of catalysts. Furthermore, a different range of Cu/Zn/A1 ratios were used in this set of preparations and this resulted in the production, by method 'B', of catalysts with copper contents of between 43 wt.-% and 61 wt.-%. On completion of the precipitation and ageing processes the catalyst slurries were filtered and then washed with demineralised water until no further reduction in the sodium content of the filtercake could be obtained. The materials were then dried at 120 and carefully analyzed (by powder X-ray diffraction) in order to determine the mineralogies of any crystalline hydroxy carbonate compounds which had been formed by the precipitation and ageing processes. It was found that each of the preparations did produce some crystalline material and that clear differences existed between the mineralogy of the crystalline phases which were generated in the type 'A' and type 'B' catalysts. The dried catalyst precursors were subsequently calcined at an elevated temperature in order to generate the CuO/ZnO/AI203 catalysts. R.A.

Relationship between the copper metal surface area and water-gas shift activity of two discrete groups of Cu/ZnO/AI203 catalysts. The relative activities of the catalyst samples were obtained in a multitubular microreactor system. The catalysts were reduced in a dilute stream of hydrogen at a maximum temperature of 220 prior to admission of a standard shift reaction process gas to the catalysts. The tests were carded out at a total pressure of 30 bar and at a temperature of 220. All of these conditions are close to those used in industrial systems although the space velocities used in the tests (40 000 h-I_ 90 000 h ~) were far higher than those in industrial units since low conversions were required in order to determine the activities of the catalyst samples. The activities of the catalysts were measured, on a mass basis, as relative to that of a standard industrial catalyst. The reproducibility of this test methodology has been found to be + 7%. The copper metal surface areas of the catalysts were determined by utilising the reactive chemisorption of nitrous oxide in a frontal chromatographic analysis system [6]. The copper areas determined by this method are quoted as square meters of copper per gram of catalyst. The reproducibility of this test has been found to be + 5%. Fig. 1 displays the data which were generated from analysis of the relative shift activities and copper surface areas of all of these samples. It is evident that it is not possible to describe any simple relationship between the relative activity and copper surface area of all of the type 'A' and type 'B' catalyst samples. However, the activity of all of the samples which originated from identical precipitation and ageing conditions, and which appeared to contain similar crystalline hydroxy car- bonate minerals, can, separately, be correlated with the copper surface area of the catalysts. For example, a linear plot (correlation coefficient, R2= 0.93) which passes close to the origin can be drawn through all of the type 'A' catalysts. A discrete linear relationship is also apparent for the type 'B' samples (R2= 0.93) but in this case the gradient of the line was found to be less than half of that of the line which describes the area-activity relationship of the type 'A' catalysts. The two groups of catalysts which have been analyzed in this study show dis- tinctly different relationships between copper area and activity. For example, it appears to be possible to generate a shift catalyst with a relative activity of 1.0 with 20 m2 of copper area of a type A catalyst while this activity could only be obtained with a copper area of 40 m2 of the type B catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded L4 R.A. Hadden et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 122 (1995) L1-L4 that not all of the copper area is active in the shift reaction. Indeed, these data suggest that it is only a fraction of the copper surface which is active in these catalysts and it appears that catalysts derived from the type A preparation route have a greater proportion of this active fraction of the surface per unit copper area than catalysts which are derived from the type B route. It should also be noted that since the rate of methanol synthesis has been found to be linearly dependent upon the copper surface area of Cu/ZnO/AI203 catalysts [ 1,2,5] our understanding of the impact of precipitation and ageing parameters on the activity of shift catalysts will, for example, allow the manufacture of catalysts which are highly active for the shift reaction but which have a low selectivity for the synthesis of methanol.
