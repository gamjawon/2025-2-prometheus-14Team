In this study, porous g-C3N4 (pg-CN) nanosheets were prepared by a simple and single-step thermal decomposition technique using NH4Cl. The structural and optical properties of the nanosheets were carefully studied. The investigations revealed that the NH4Cl imparted good exfoliation properties to the pg-CN nanosheets. Visible light harvesting was improved and the bandgap also decreased for the pg-CN nanosheets compared to bulk pg-CN. The pg-CN nanosheets showed better degradation percentage of RhB over bulk pg-CN. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Graphitic carbon nitride Porous nanosheets Optical properties Photocatalysis 1 Introduction Presently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanostructures are attracting increased attention from researchers working on applications pertaining to photocatalysis, Li-ion batteries, sensors, imaging, and light-emitting diodes due to their fascinating properties such as non-toxicity, environmental stability, lack of metal components, visible light absorption, earth-abundance and graphene-like 2D structure [1]. Two-dimensional pg-CN nanosheets exhibit many exciting properties and higher efficiencies than bulk g-C3N4 with regard to photocatalysis [2]. Various approaches have been previously adopted to modify the morphology of bulk g-C3N4 such that it has a thin and porous 2D structure to improve its photocatalytic efficiency [3,4]. Generally, to introduce a porous 2D structure, post-synthesis is required after producing bulk g-C3N4. Xiaojie et al. reported creating 2D porous ultrathin g-CN nanosheets from bulk g-CN using mixed acid (HNO3+ H2SO4) in the second step of a multi-stage process to ensure effective photocatalytic H2 evolution [5]. Minjie et al. treated bulk g-C3N4 in a H2 environment at 500 °C to produce g-C3N4 nanosheets, and reported boosted H2 evolution activity as well as improved photocatalytic activity with regard to pollutant removal [6]. Chengkong et al. prepared g-CN nanosheets from bulk g-CN using an ammonia solution with hydrothermal synthesis, and achieved five times greater performance than bulk g-C3N4 [7]. In-situ synthesis is always beneficial if one wishes to attain specific material properties for a particular purpose. Recently, g-C3N4 nanosheets were produced in a single step using gas templates such as NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, and KCl/NH4Cl [8–10]. pg-CN nanosheets prepared using C₂H₂O₄ in a single step showed the best photocatalytic performance [11]. The combination of a porous and 2D nanosheet structure of g-C3N4 in one-step synthesis has rarely been reported [12]. Chuang et al. reported producing g-C3N4 nanosheets by adopting a slow ramping rate (1 °C/min), with a holding temperature of 550 °C [13]. In the present study, our interest lies in synthesizing porous g-C3N4 nanosheets in a single-step approach via thermal polycondensation using CO(NH₂)₂ (urea) and NH4Cl. Therefore, we adopted a fast ramping rate of 15 °C/min and a holding temperature of 450 °C. Our approach allows the creation of nanosheets and a porous structure simultaneously. The effect of the amount of NH4Cl was systematically investigated and optimized. In the synthesis procedure, NH4Cl acts as a supplementary material, which provides a dynamic gas template enabling the formation of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets. With the gradual rise in temperature, urea polymerizes and NH4Cl decomposes into NH3 and HCl. These aspects played a significant role in the formation of in-situ g-C3N4 nanosheets. The optimized sample shows the 2D morphology of the g-C3N4 nanosheets, including its porous structure. The nanosheets so-prepared also show the best photocatalytic activity. 2 Experimental procedure Bulk pg-CN was made by thermally decomposing 10 g of urea at 450 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 15 °C/min. pg-CN nanosheets were prepared by grinding 10 g of urea and different amounts of NH4Cl in an agate mortar for 15 min. The ground mixture was then transferred to a crucible with a cover and heat-treated in a muffle furnace with a ramping rate of 15 °C/min. After natural cooling, the sample was collected and ground into powder. Different amounts of NH4Cl (0, 1, 2, and 3 g) were mixed with 10 g of urea and the corresponding mixtures were named as CNN-0, CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3, respectively. 2.1 Photocatalytic experiments Photocatalytic activity was evaluated in terms of degradation of RhB, a model organic pollutant, under visible light using 50 mg of photocatalyst and 100 mL of RhB (10 ppm). All photodegradation experiments were performed at ambient temperature. A halogen lamp (100 W, 220 V H-PAR30) with a 410 nm cut-off filter (UV L41, Kenko Tokina, Japan) was fitted just below the lamp. It served as a visible light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. To maintain constant temperature, a quartz photoreactor with a water circulation jacket was fixed in a steel container along with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical experiment, prior to light illumination, the dye solution was stirred for 60 min in the dark to ensure adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye solution and the photocatalyst. After a certain time interval, 4.0 mL aliquots were collected and centrifuged. An ultra-violet–visible–near infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) double-beam spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA) was used to monitor the concentration of the dye during the photoreaction. The absorbance of the clear solution was recorded at λmax of 552 nm. To confirm that the photocatalytic activity is due to the photocatalyst alone, we carried out blank experiments without a catalyst under visible light (photolysis) and with a catalyst in the dark (adsorption). 2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared samples were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6100, Shimadzu, Japan) with CuK(alpha) radiation. Transmission electron microscopy images were taken (H-7600, Hitachi, Japan). Optical absorption spectra were obtained using a UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent, USA). Photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a spectrofluorometer (Flourolog-3-21, HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Germany) at an excitation of 280 nm. The infrared (IR) spectra were also recorded (6700 FT-IR, Thermo Nicolet, USA). Surface area analyses were conducted by applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) desorption analysis in order to determine the pore size and volume of the samples. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of bulk pg-CN and pg-CN nanosheets with a strong (0 0 2) diffraction plane and a weak (1 0 0) diffraction plane. For bulk pg-CN, the strong diffraction peak of (0 0 2) at 27.33° indicates the characteristic interlayer-stacking of aromatic systems. The low intense diffraction peak at around 13° is analogous to the (1 0 0) plane, indicating the in-plane structural packing motif of tri-s-triazine units [14]. The addition of NH4Cl modifies the stacking of the g-C3N4 layers, which was clearly observed in the XRD patterns. The intensity of the (0 0 2) diffraction plane was significantly decreased and the position was shifted to higher angles, showing a decreasing trend of interlayer distance between the g-C3N4 layers [5]. The strongest XRD peak of the (0 0 2) lattice plane is the characteristic interlayer periodic stacking along the c-axis in g-C3N4, which indicates the gallery distance between the layers. The shifting of the peak position to higher angles reflects decreasing gallery distance from the Debye–Scherrer equation (i.e., d = nλ/βcosθ). In the present case, the intensity of the XRD peak was decreased and shifted from 27.33° to 27.40°, which confirms the decreased gallery distance between layers of g-C3N4. Among all the samples, CNN-2 shows the low intense diffraction peak for the (0 0 2) plane. The in-situ addition of NH4Cl affects the successful formation of pg-CN nanosheets. 3.2 Functional group analysis The Fourier Transform-IR spectrum of bulk pg-CN and pg-CN nanosheets is shown in Fig. S1. The FT-IR spectrum of the pg-CN nanosheets was similar to that of bulk pg-CN, indicating similar chemical features and holding of the basic surface functional units even after the addition of NH4Cl [8]. The strong and broad absorption peaks between 3640 and 2830 cm−1 arise due to the NH stretches. The intensity of this broad peak increases in the case of pg-CN nanosheets due to enlarged interlayer spacing [10]. The absorption bands around 1545 and 1627 cm−1 are ascribed to CN stretching vibration modes. The absorption bands at 1223, 1314, and 1450 cm−1 are related to aromatic CN stretching. The peak at 804 cm−1 is attributed to the characteristic breathing mode of s-triazine units, which belongs to the condensed carbon and nitrogen heterocycles showing a planar structure [12]. From the above outcomes, the crystal structure and chemical composition of the in-situ pg-CN nanosheets are in conformity with that of the bulk pg-CN. 3.3 TEM investigation Fig. 2 displays the TEM image of CNN-2, and Fig. S2 display the TEM images of CNN-0, CNN-1 and CNN-3 pg-CN nanosheets. Fig. S2 shows the porous morphology of bulk pg-CN (CNN-0). The addition of NH4Cl modifies the morphology as delaminated g-C3N4 while maintaining the porous structure. Sample CNN-1 is slightly delaminated and shows porosity, perhaps due to insufficient NH4Cl. In the present work, the TEM images clearly show a porous structure and stacking of layers. With the addition of NH4Cl to the urea, all the samples show a porous structure, but delamination of g-C3N4 layers is also observed. The finding matches the XRD result well, where the concept of delamination was explained based on the intensity of the (0 0 2) plane. Sample CNN-2 is a 2D sheet-like and porous structure and CNN-3 shows an ultrathin nanosheet-like morphology without any reduction in porosity. Thus, the amount of NH4Cl plays a major role in the final morphology, and we believe that sample CNN-2 is the optimized sample with a 2D porous structure. 3.4 BET analysis The change in pore structure and BET surface areas of the g-C3N4 layers were studied using N2 adsorption–desorption measurements (Figs. 3 and S3). The obtained experimental parameters, namely specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore size, appear in Table S1. All the prepared samples exhibit type IV hysteresis loops, the characteristic isotherms of mesopores [2]. The surface area of all the g-C3N4 samples prepared with urea and NH4Cl was greater than that for pristine g-C3N4. The BET surface area of CNN-2 is almost seven times higher than that of CNN-0. The pore sizes of all the samples range from 10 to 20 nm. The results confirm the identity of the optimized sample: CNN-2 shows the best properties for surface area, pore volume, and average pore size, which play a significant role in increasing photocatalytic performance. 3.5 Optical absorption study The optical absorption of bulk pg-CN and pg-CN nanosheets with different amounts NH4Cl was characterized using UV–vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4 ). The figure shows that the absorption of all the samples increased effectively in the visible region compared to that of bulk pg-CN. Optical absorption analysis revealed two significant results: red-shifted light absorption, and a tuned and decreased bandgap. This result may be ascribed to two characteristics. The extended electron delocalization in the 2D networks of g-C3N4 leads to the slightly red-shifted band-edge positions. The tuned bandgap is due to the creation of interband defect states in g-C3N4 [15]. The band gap of the prepared samples was calculated using the Tauc plot and is shown in Fig. S4.The bandgap value decreases from 2.79 eV for bulk pg-CN to 2.67 eV for pg-CN nanosheets, suggesting that the electronic structure of g-C3N4 was remarkably modified. 3.6 Photoluminescence study Fig. 5 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of bulk pg-CN and pg-CN nanosheets. The single and strong PL emission peak around 445 nm is characteristic of g-C3N4 [15]. All the prepared pg-CN powders have PL spectra comparable to bulk pg-CN, but the PL emission intensity of the pg-CN nanosheets decreases gradually. This high intensity of the PL peak reflects the nature of the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The intensity of the PL peak decreased further due to the addition of NH4Cl. The decreasing trend in PL emission is due to the inhibition of the recombination rate of photo-excited electron-hole pairs, which in turn is ascribed to the thin structure of the few-layer g-C3N4 [9]. This inhibition in recombination of charge carriers is helpful for the enhancement of photocatalyst performance. Sample CNN-2 showed the lowest PL intensity and best photocatalytic performance among all the samples. 3.7 Photocatalytic activity The photocatalytic performance of the bulk pg-CN and pg-CN nanosheets was estimated by the degradation of RhB dye under visible light. The experimental results confirm that the degradation efficiency of the pg-CN nanosheets was enhanced over that if bulk pg-CN, which could be attributed to the improving charge transfer property. Fig. S5 shows the absorption spectra of RhB during the progress of photodegradation of sample CNN-2 under visible light irradiation. The absorption peak of RhB at 552 nm is continually decreasing. Fig. 6 shows the photocatalytic degradation of RhB over the pg-CN nanosheets (CNN-2), indicating removal of 98% of the dye within 150 min. As per Fig. S6, the degradation efficiency of RhB is about 68, 81, 98, and 86% for CNN-0, CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation activity and PL analysis reveal that CNN-2 shows best photocatalytic degradation efficiency. Catalyst loading is an important parameter to attain maximum photocatalytic efficiency. Lower catalyst loading may be affected by the lack of active sites, and higher loading leads to agglomeration, and thus, reduced photocatalytic activity. For this purpose, the optimized sample was selected (i.e., CNN-2) for further testing. Different loading amounts were tested and the result is shown in Fig. S7. The catalyst loading of 20 mg showed the highest photocatalytic efficiency of about 98% within 150 min of irradiation time. The rate constant (k) was calculated from the slope of the above graph, and showed a higher value for the most efficient photocatalyst. The obtained values for CNN-0, CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3 are 0.0091, 0.1227, 0.0192, and 0.01448 min−1, respectively. From Fig. S8, the rate constant value is higher for CNN-2, which reflects the best photocatalytic performance among all samples. The improvement in photocatalytic efficiency in pg-CN nanosheets arises from the synergetic effect of the tuned bandgap with increased light harvesting in the visible region, 2D structural configurations with an ultrathin thickness, and the porous nature of the sample. The photocatalytic mechanism of the pg-CN nanosheets is explained in Fig. 7 . Under visible light irradiation, the photo-generated electrons are transferred from the VB to the CB, and therefore, the photo-generated electrons and holes separate to form superoxide radical anions (O2 −) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). These oxidative species will convert the pollutant into CO2 and H2O. In the present investigation, pg-CN nanosheets showed excellent photocatalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the porous and 2D structure and the tuned bandgap. Cyclic stability was performed four times for sample CNN-2 and the results are shown in Fig. S9. The degradation of the pollutant decreased from 98% to 93.5%. This decrease was due to the loss of the catalyst while performing the tests. 4 Conclusion Porous and 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets were successfully prepared in a single step. The required amount of NH4Cl was optimized to provide sample CNN-2 with a sheet-like structure. The XRD and FT-IR study results confirmed the typical structural properties of the pg-CN nanosheets. The TEM images clearly showed the porous and 2D structure of g-C3N4. Bandgap tuning and increased visible light were observed through UV–vis absorption. The above modifications (namely, ultrathin 2D structure, porosity, tuned bandgap, and enhanced visible light harvesting) enhanced the photocatalytic performance of the pg-CN nanosheets.
