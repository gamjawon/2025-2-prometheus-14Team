Catalytic tests were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range 473-573 K and at 0.6 MPa total pressure. Among all metal catalysts highest methylamine production rates were obtained with the copper-alumina catalysts, affording a distribution of monomethylamine (MMA):dimethylamine (DMA) : trimethylamine (TMA) of 72 : 15 : 13 at 513 K. Increasing the ammonia concentration in the feed resulted in improved selectivity to MMA. By-products observed over copper-alumina were carbon monoxide, originating from the reverse water gas shift reaction, and water. Ni, Co, Fe and Pt showed little methylamine production, but significant methane formation, whereas Ag produced only CO, H20 and HCN. (~; 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The large scale availability of CO2, produced in any combustion process, renders it a suitable starting material for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and fuels. Although most of the work in carbon oxides hydrogenation has concentrated on CO [ 1 ], the synth- esis of methanol from carbon dioxide and hydrogen is well known [ 1-3]. On the contrary, the formation of organo-nitrogen compounds such as amines has only been described starting from CO, H2 and NH3 [4-6]. Several processes have been patented, that convert *Corresponding author.

Other products formed include methane and lower hydrocarbons [5,10,11 ], acetonitrile and HCN [6], as well as N,N-dimethyl- formamide [7]. Recently, we have shown that methyl- amines can be produced from CO2, H2 and NH3 over copper-alumina catalysts [ 13,14]. In industrial processes methylamines are produced by the exothermic reaction of methanol with ammonia over solid acidic dehydrogenation catalysts such as silica-alumina. The thermodynamically favoured pro- duct of this reaction is trimethylamine (TMA) [12], whereas monomethylamine (MMA) and dimethyl- amine (DMA) are of major commercial interest. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 (i~ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Gredig et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 249-260 Methylamines are valuable chemicals for the synthesis of a broad range of products. They are used in pesticide production, solvent production, and water treatment. Intrigued by our previous studies with copper- alumina catalysts [13,14], where MMA was the main amine product, we tested other metal-alumina catalysts, including Ag, Ni, Pt, Co and Fe. Here we report the catalytic behaviour of these metal- alumina catalysts in the reaction of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and ammonia to methylamines (MMA, DMA, TMA). solution of potassium hydroxide at 353 K and aged for 96 h at room temperature. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water until the filtrate was neutral and dried overnight at 393 K. The crushed and sieved catalysts were reduced with hydrogen for 2 h (except the Fe catalysts, which were reduced for 4 h) before the catalytic tests. The suitable reduction temperature for each metal was determined based on a TPR profile of the catalyst. Catalysts compositions and reduction temperatures are listed in Table 1. 2.2. Catalytic tests\" 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation All catalysts, except the platinum catalyst, were prepared from corresponding metal nitrate solutions, aluminum hydroxide and KOH, as described in detail elsewhere [15]. The pure alumina sample was pre- pared by the same procedure but without adding a metal nitrate solution. The platinum catalyst was also prepared in the same way using hexachloroplatinic- (IV)-acid (Hz(PtC16).6H20) as platinum precursor. A slurry of aluminum hydroxide gel in an aqueous hexachloroplatinic-acid solution was mixed with a Catalytic tests were performed using a stainless steel continuous tubular fixed-bed reactor (length: 35 cm, diameter: 0.8 cm) at a total pressure of 0.6 MPa in the temperature range 473-573 K. The experiments were carried out using 3 g catalyst (affording ca. 8 cm catalyst bed length) and a reactant flow rate of 150cm3 (STP) per minute (GHSV=2250 h-l). The feed gas, containing 60 mol% H2, 20 mol% CO2, 0-20 mol% NH3, and N2 as a balance, was mixed from component gases using mass flow controllers. The reaction gases employed in the experiments were CO2 (99.995%), H2 (99.999%), NH3 (99.3%), and N2 (99.995%) as inert gas.

To prevent formation of ammonium carbo- nate in the system, all tubings after the reactor were heated at 343 K. 2.3. Catalyst characterisation BET surface areas were measured by adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. Before measurement, the samples were degassed at 0.1 Pa and 473 K. The relative pressure range P/Po between 0.05 and 0.2 was used to calculate the BET surface areas, assuming a cross-sectional area of 0.162 nm2 for the nitrogen molecule. Metal surface areas were roughly estimated from metal surface concentrations (%) determined by XPS and the BET surface areas (Smetal=metal%BET/ 1 00). XPS analysis of the catalysts after catalytic tests was carried out on a Leybold-Heraeus LHS 11 MCD instrument using Mg Kc~-radiation at a power of 240 W. The analyser was operated at a constant pass-energy of 150 eV. The pressure in the chamber during measurements was 5 x 10 9 mbar. 3. Results 3.1. Catalyst properties Textural properties of the coprecipitated metal- alumina catalysts and the pure alumina component are listed in Table 1. As a consequence of the different metal loadings and reduction temperatures, BET sur- face area and average pore diameter varied in a broad range. Highest BET surface areas (>300 m2/g) were obtained with Ni, Pt, Co and Fe catalysts of low metal loading, whereas higher metal contents resulted in considerably lower surface areas (<200 m2/g). All catalysts, except Cu-27 and Cu-46 (numbers designate approximate metal loading in wt%) which also showed some microporosity, were completely mesoporous. The metal surface areas, roughly esti- mated from XPS surface analysis and the BET surface areas, ranged from 2 m2/g (Pt-2) to 49 mZ/g (Ni-39, Co-40). 3.2.

Gredig et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 162 (1997) 249-260 at two different temperatures, 513 and 553 K. The pure alumina showed no catalytic activity, neither for amine synthesis nor for any other reaction under the experimental conditions used. Consequently we can state that the catalytic behaviour of all tested catalysts was mainly determined by the metal com- ponent. As concerns the activity for amine production (MMA, DMA, TMA), highest rates were observed with copper catalysts. The methylamine distribution changed significantly depending on the metal catalyst. For the copper catalysts no marked dependence of the amine distribution on copper loading was observed. Several catalysts (Ni-2, Pt-2, Co-4 and Fe-35) showed a high selectivity to MMA, but with low production rates. CO, H20 and HCN (only with Cu-9) were the by-products detected with copper catalysts, whereas all the other metals showed significant methane for- mation, and in the case of Fe (acetonitrile and ethyl- amines) and Co (acetonitrile) even C-C bond formation. 3.3. Copper catalysts The catalytic behaviour of the copper-alumina catalysts Cu-47 and Cu-27 was used as a reference. Both catalysts showed a similar methytamine produc- tion rate, indicating that higher copper loadings than 27 wt% had virtually no influence on activity and methylamine distribution (Table 2). Carbon monox- ide, MMA, DMA, TMA, methanol and water were the only products detected with these catalysts. The reac- tion temperature and the NH3/CO2 ratio strongly influenced both NH3 conversion and methylamine distribution. The temperature dependence of the pro- duct distribution, presented in Fig. 1 for Cu-27, shows that all three methylamines were produced over the whole temperature range (473-573 K) investigated, with MMA being favoured at higher temperatures. Carbon monoxide, produced via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2+H2~+~-CO+H20), appeared at 513 K and developed to the main product for temperatures exceeding 560 K.

At low NH3 concentrations TMA was the main amine product, whereas at higher NH3 con- centrations MMA was the dominant product. With increasing NH3 concentrations, methanol synthesis was suppressed completely and CO production dropped from 1.78 to 0.12 mol% for an ammonia concentration of 20 mol% in the feed. As expected, the catalyst with low copper loading, Cu-9, was significantly less active for the amine synthesis (Table 2, Fig. 2) than the highly loaded copper catalysts (Cu-47 and Cu-27). MMA was the predominant amine product in all experiments, again favoured at higher temperatures. Only trace amounts of DMA and TMA were detected. Other carbon con- taining products in the product gas were CO and HCN. CO was mainly formed at higher temperatures, simi- larly as with the other copper catalysts. Note that HCN production only occurred with Cu-9. With 20 mol% NH3 in the feed and in the medium temperature range (513-553 K), it reached a maximum concentration of 0.030 mol%. With lower NH3 concentrations, HCN formation decreased and then disappeared completely. Small amounts of methanol (0.011 mol%) were only produced when the feed gas contained no ammonia. Methanol formation was also completely suppressed in the presence of ammonia. 3.4. Silver catalyst The silver-alumina catalyst, Ag-44, showed no activity for amine synthesis in all experiments. The only products observed were water, carbon monoxide and HCN, which reached concentrations up to 0.127 mol% at 533 K. Even without ammonia in the feed, no methanol could be detected in the product gas. 3.5. Nickel catalysts Catalyst Ni-39 was highly active for methane synth- esis, as expected from the literature [16-19]. At 473 K small amounts of MMA (0.108 mol%) were detected, besides methane (0.933 mol%) and traces of carbon 254 S.V.

At higher temperatures MMA and carbon monoxide formation declined and methane production became completely dominant. Above 503 K, the exothermic methane formation resulted in a hydrogen consumption of nearly 100%. Under these conditions methane and water were the only products detected. Amine production could not be observed at temperatures above 503 K. Catalyst Ni-2, with low metal content, was signifi- cantly less active for methane synthesis. The tempera- ture dependence of the product distribution is shown in Fig. 3. MMA, carbon monoxide and methane were the only carbon containing products detected in the pro- duct gas. MMA and carbon monoxide production reached their maximum at 513 K. At the same tem- perature methane formation started to increase mark- edly and for temperatures higher than 540 K, methane synthesis dominated the other reactions (MMA synth- esis and RWGS). Without ammonia in the feed gas, traces of methanol (0.004mo1%) were detected besides CO and CH4 at 513 K. Methanol was com- pletely absent in the presence of ammonia in the feed. With increasing ammonia concentrations at 513 K, the MMA production increased, whereas methane and carbon monoxide production decreased. With both nickel catalysts neither DMA nor TMA were observed in all experiments. 3.6. Platinum catalyst The platinum catalyst Pt-2 was less active than the highly loaded copper (Cu-47 and Cu-27) catalysts. As emerges from Fig. 4, carbon monoxide was the main carbon containing product over the whole temperature range investigated. MMA, the main amine product, reached its maximum concentration of 0.282 mol% at 533 K. At the same temperature methane formation started, which increased with higher temperature, whereas MMA production decreased slightly. In the whole temperature range only traces of DMA and TMA were detected. Without ammonia in the feed, water, carbon mon- oxide, methane and methanol were the products observed at 513 K. Upon addition of ammonia to the feed, the formation of methane and methanol was completely suppressed, and carbon monoxide S.V.

Instead, the synthesis of amines started, with MMA reaching a maximum (0.155 mol% MMA) at 10 mol% ammonia in the feed. For ammonia concentrations exceeding 10 mol%, methylamine formation started to decline slightly. 3.7. Cobalt catalysts The highly loaded cobalt catalyst Co-40 was very active for methane synthesis, similar as the highly loaded nickel catalyst Ni-39. At low temperatures, small amounts of carbon monoxide and methylamines were detected. Above 513 K, the GC signal of MMA was superimposed by a large water peak, rendering the quantitative measurement of MMA impossible. At temperatures exceeding 533 K, methane and water were predominant products besides the small amounts of carbon monoxide. Similarly as in the case of nickel, the low loaded cobalt-alumina catalyst Co-4, was significantly less active lor methane synthesis than Co-40. The resulting lower amount of water allowed the quantitative ana- lysis of MMA over the whole temperature range examined. The corresponding product distribution is shown in Fig. 5. MMA synthesis reached its max- imum at 533 K. Traces of DMAwere detected over the whole temperature range, whereas no TMA was observed. At the same temperature, methane produc- tion began to rise slightly and carbon monoxide for- mation (RWGS) showed a strong increase. At 613 K (not shown in Fig. 5), traces of acetonitrile were observed, as expected from literature [20]. Without ammonia in the feed gas, carbon monoxide was the only carbon containing product. Methanol was not detected under the conditions investigated (513 K). Increasing the ammonia content in the feed resulted in higher production of MMA. Methylamine formation started upon addition of ammonia to CO2/H2 and increasing the ammonia content in the feed resulted in higher production of MMA. Interestingly, carbon monoxide formation also increased with increasing ammonia concentration. 3.8.

At tem- peratures above 553 K, traces of TMA and HCN were detected. At these temperatures ethylamines and other amine products as well as hydrocarbons containing two or more carbon atoms were formed. These pro- ducts, in trace amounts, were not fully identified and quantified. At 613 K acetonitrile was also observed. The low loaded iron catalyst Fe-4 was not active at all for amine synthesis. The only carbon containing product found was HCN. 4. Discussion All catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation in a potassium containing solution and were thoroughly washed with distilled water after filtration. On the surface of some catalysts (A1203, Pt-2, Fe-35 and Fe- 4), traces of potassium (< 1 at%) were detected by XPS analysis. Consequently a promoting effect of potas- sium cannot be ruled out completely with these cata- lysts. The pure alumina component, prepared in the same way as the metal-alumina catalysts, was not active for the methylamine synthesis starting from CO2/Hz/NH3. Thus the catalytic behaviour of the tested metal- alumina catalysts is governed by the metal-compo- nent. Under standard conditions the various metal-alu- mina catalysts did not show significant deactivation during catalytic tests. Deactivation of copper, nickel and cobalt catalysts in the presence of ammonia and methylamines can be caused by the formation of inactive metal nitrides (Cu, Ni, Co) as well as by the formation of carbonaceous deposits and metal carbides (Ni, Co) in the absence of hydrogen [21- 23]. However, the relatively large hydrogen partial pressure of the reactant gas (60 mol%) in methylamine synthesis renders these deactivation processes unlike- ly. The mono-alkylated amine MMA, which is also of commercial interest, was the prevailing methylamine produced with all catalysts. Interestingly, the dispro- portionation of the MMA product (Eqs. (1)-(3)), which is also catalysed by metal-alumina catalysts [22-24], seems to have little influence on the amine distribution. 2MMA~+~-DMA + NH3 MMA + DMA,,~-TMA + NH3 2DMA~-TMA + MMA (1) (2) (3) TMA would be the thermodynamically favoured methylamine, if the disproportionation would control the amine distribution [24]. However, the dispropor- tionation reactions seem not to control the distribution of the methylamines. Likewise as observed for the deactivation processes, higher hydrogen partial pres- sures were found to inhibit the disproportionation of methylamines [23]. Another unfavourable side reaction, which can occur with nickel, cobalt and iron catalysts, is hydro- cracking of the product amines (Eqs. (4)-(6)) [23]. The comparably low amine production observed with nickel, cobalt and iron catalyst could be explained by the occurrence of hydrocracking reactions. Conse- quently, a minor contribution of hydrocracking reac- tions to methane formation cannot be ruled out at higher temperatures, although CH4 is expected to be predominantly formed by direct hydrogenation of CO2. MMA + H2~.~--CH4 + NH3 DMA + 2H2~-2CH4 + NH3 TMA + 3H2~-3CH4 + NH3 (4) (5) (6) As regards the major products identified with the different metal-alumina catalysts, the results can be explained in terms of the contribution of four compet- ing reactions, leading to methanol/methylamines (reaction I), carbon monoxide (reaction II), hydrogen cyanide (reaction III), and methane/Fischer-Tropsch products (reaction IV), as illustrated in Fig. 7. Metha- nol synthesis occurs only in the absence of ammonia and is observed for the catalysts containing copper, nickel, or platinum. The fact that methanol disappears in the product mixture in the presence of ammonia with these catalysts indicates, that an intermediate in methanol synthesis reacts with ammonia to the amine (MMA) [13,14]. Previous mechanistic studies on the copper catalysed amination of aliphatic alcohols [23- 26] and on methanol synthesis starting from CO2 [27] 258 S.V.

Reactions observed on various metal-alumina catalysts in the CO2, H2, and NH3 system. indicated, that this intermediate is an adsorbed alde- hyde-type species (in the present case adsorbed for- maldehyde). The involvement of an aldehyde-type intermediate has also been suggested by Vedage et al. [4,28] on the basis of chemical trapping experi- ments with amines in the synthesis of methanol from CO and H2. Kliger et al. [5] also proposed a pathway, where n-alkylamines are synthesised from CO/H2/ NH3 over fused iron catalysts by the reaction of ammonia and hydrogen with a surface intermediate, from which n-alkanols are obtained in the absence of NH3. To form the di- and tri-alkylated methylamines (DMA and TMA), MMA or DMA are proposed to react with the formaldehyde intermediate, instead of ammonia. Carbon monoxide, produced by the reverse water gas shift reaction, is formed on all catalysts. At 573 K the RWGS reaction is dominant for the highly loaded copper catalysts and for the catalysts Pt-2, Co-4, and Fe-4. Note that in the absence of ammonia substan- tially more CO is observed with all catalysts at 513 K, except Co-4, which showed increased CO production upon addition of ammonia to the CO2/H2 feed. As expected from the literature [16-19], methane is produced from CO2/H2 with the catalysts containing cobalt, nickel, and platinum. No hydrocarbons other than methane are found with these catalysts, which is in accordance with results from the literature [19,27], showing that in contrast to reactions starting from CO/ H2, CH4 is almost exclusively formed from CO2/H2. In CO/H2 reactions, methane and higher hydrocarbons are produced from adsorbed CO via a dissociative mechanism [16,27], whereas in CO2/I-I2 reactions methane was reported to be formed via an oxygenated S.V. Gredig et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 162 (1997) 249-260 259 species (formate) as pivotal surface intermediate [27]. Similarly as observed for methanol and CO, methane formation is suppressed by the addition of ammonia to the CO2/H2 feed at 513 K with the Co, Ni, or Pt containing catalysts. In addition to methane as the predominant product, catalyst Fe-35 produced traces of hydrocarbons and alkylamines with two or more C-atoms at tempera- tures above 553 K (reactions of type IV). A reaction scheme for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was sug- gested by Henrici-Oliv6 and Oliv6 [29,30], taking into account results obtained with CO/Hz/NH3 mixtures. Higher hydrocarbons are thereby formed by carbon monoxide insertion into an alkyl-metal bond. Kliger et al, [5] reported that the reaction of CO]Hz/NH3 mix- tures over Fe catalysts yields an unselective range of products with a Schulz-Flory distribution. In the present study of methylamine synthesis from CO2, H2 and NH3, products with one carbon atom (methane, methylamines) were prevailing due to the compara- tively low concentration of CO under reaction condi- tions. Besides the products described above, HCN (Cu-9, Ag-44, Fe-35, Fe-4) and acetonitrile (Co-4, Fe-35) were produced under certain conditions. Formation of HCN and of nitrile species was occasionally observed in the reaction of CO/H2/NH3-mixtures [6,28]. Nitrile species can also occur via a side reaction during dehydroamination of alcohols with ammonia at higher temperatures [23]. An often postulated pathway to HCN involves the formation of intermediate isocya- nate species on the surface [31-33]. 5. Conclusions Among the metal-alumina catalysts investigated (Cu, Ag, Pt, Ni, Co, Fe), the highly loaded copper catalysts Cu-47 and Cu-27 were most active for methylamine synthesis. For all catalysts producing methylamines, the addition of ammonia to the feed suppressed methanol formation. With more than 5 tool% ammonia in the feed methanol could not be detected any more at 513 K. All catalysts active for methylamine synthesis at 513 K, produced methyl- amines at a higher rate compared to methanol (without ammonia in the feed). This indicates that for all these catalysts ammonia and hydrogen are reacting with a surface intermediate, probably adsorbed formalde- hyde, which reacts to methanol in the absence of ammonia. Methane formation is favoured compared to amine synthesis at higher temperature with all methane producing catalysts (Ni, Pt, Co, Fe). Carbon monoxide was formed via RWGS reaction on all catalysts. Except for the nickel containing catalyst, for which carbon monoxide formation decreased on the cost of methane formation at higher temperatures, carbon monoxide formation increased with higher temperature. HCN formation was observed with Cu-9, Ag-44, Fe-35 and Fe-4. On the pure alumina no HCN was formed, indicating that the metal is crucial for HCN formation under the conditions given.

Catalytic behaviour of various metal-alumina catalysts Silvia V. Gredig RenéA. Koeppel Alfons Baiker ∗ Department of Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH-Zentrum, CH-8092 Zürich, Switzerland ∗ Corresponding author. Tel.: +41 1 6323153; fax: +41 1 6321163 The synthesis of methylamines from CO2, H2 and NH3 has been investigated over various metal-alumina catalysts (Cu, Ag, Ni, Pt, Co and Fe) prepared by coprecipitation. Catalytic tests were carried out using a fixed-bed reactor in the temperature range 473–573 K and at 0.6 MPa total pressure. Among all metal catalysts highest methylamine production rates were obtained with the copper-alumina catalysts, affording a distribution of monomethylamine (MMA): dimethylamine (DMA): trimethylamine (TMA) of 72 : 15 : 13 at 513 K. Increasing the ammonia concentration in the feed resulted in improved selectivity to MMA. By-products observed over copper-alumina were carbon monoxide, originating from the reverse water gas shift reaction, and water. Ni, Co, Fe and Pt showed little methylamine production, but significant methane formation, whereas Ag produced only CO, H2O and HCN.
