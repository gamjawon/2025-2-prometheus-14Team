WHEELOCK 2 1 Institute of Catalysis, Key Laboratory of Applied Chemistry of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310028, Zhejiang, China 2 Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames 50011, USA Abstract: A Ni/MgO catalyst for CO 2 reforming of toluene was prepared by impregnating MgO with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 . During calcination, some of the NiO diffused into the MgO and formed a solid solution structure of NiO-MgO, which was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. In the temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen analysis, only a small part of the Ni species in the outermost layer was reduced to me- tallic Ni at 700 o C. The calcination temperature played a key role in determining the subsequent catalytic activity of Ni/MgO, consequently the catalyst calcined at 600 o C had the highest activity. This catalyst also had the highest surface concentration of reduced Ni, which probably accounted for its high activity. During the reforming tests, a small amount of coke was deposited on Ni/MgO catalyst. Polyaro- matic compounds were observed by Raman spectroscopy. The coke was probably responsible for the activity loss of Ni/MgO. Key words: tar; carbon dioxide; reforming; nickel; magnesium oxide ; supported catalyst; calcination temperature; Raman spectroscopy In recent years, biomass gasification for the production of syngas (CO and H 2 ) has attracted considerable attention [1,2]. However, during gasification, tar is produced as an undesirable by-product, which can plug process piping, decrease the re- coverable calorific value, and pollute the environment [3,4]. Much effort has been devoted to eliminate the tar by employing mechanical, catalytic, and thermal methods [5]. Among these methods, tar reforming is one of the most promising because it provides more syngas. During biomass gasification, steam is usually used as the gasifying agent, so tar reforming with steam has attracted more attention than reforming with CO 2 to produce syngas [3â€“8]. However, the concentration of CO 2 in the raw product gas from biomass gasification can range from 10 to 30 vol%, depending on the gasification conditions [9,10]. Therefore, to produce high quality syngas, it would be advantageous to employ CO 2 reforming of tar which would reduce both the tar content and CO 2 content of the raw product gas from biomass gasification. Furthermore, by using CO 2 , a higher ratio of CO/H 2 is pro- duced, which would facilitate the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of long-chain hydrocarbons [11]. Ni-based catalysts are widely used for reforming hydrocar- bons because of their good performance and relatively low cost compared to other catalysts. However, commercial application can be hindered by carbon deposition and agglomeration of Ni. Because of the strong interaction between NiO and MgO which can result in the formation of a NiO-MgO solid solution that promotes Ni dispersion, and because of the moderate basicity of MgO which suppresses coking, promising results have been obtained by employing Ni/MgO for either methane reforming [11] or tar reforming with steam [12â€“14]. For CO 2 reforming of toluene, a model compound for tar, it has been found that the catalytic activity of Ni/MgO is greater than that of Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ni/ZrO 2 , or Ni/SiO 2 [15]. To improve the suitability of a Ni/MgO catalyst for CO 2 reforming of tar, it become necessary to study several factors which influence the interaction be- KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 tween Ni species and MgO, including the preparation method, calcination temperature, and chemical precursors. Usually, a slight shift of MgO diffraction peaks to higher angles in X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles has been used to indicate a NiO-MgO solid solution structure [16]. However, this method is less useful for a low Ni loading or low calcina- tion temperature [17]. For these conditions, Raman spectros- copy provides a better method of analysis because of the much greater difference in the resulting spectra [18,19]. Previously it had been found that the by-product coke formed during a reforming process usually deactivates the catalyst [20]. In a more recent study of CO 2 reforming of toluene, the mass percent of coke deposited on Ni/MgO cata- lysts ranged from 0.5% to 3.3% depending on the molar ratio of CO 2 /toluene. The determination of such small concentrations of coke (< 1 wt%) is not readily determined by a tempera- ture-programmed oxidation with CO 2 test with a mass spec- troscopy as the detector [15], whereas, Raman spectroscopy has proved useful [21,22]. For this report, the effect of calcination temperature on the property and activity of a Ni/MgO catalyst for CO 2 reforming of toluene was investigated. The catalyst was characterized by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), tempera- ture-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H 2 -TPR), H 2 -chemisorption, and Raman spectroscopy. These methods provided a means for detecting changes in Ni species and for relating the change in catalyst activity to structural changes. Raman spectroscopy also provided a way to detect the deposi- tion of coke on the catalyst surface and thereby show that it could account for catalyst deactivation. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The Ni/MgO catalysts with 5 wt% Ni loading were prepared by an impregnation method. Reagent grade MgO powder (Shanghai Chemicals, A BET = 35.0 m 2 /g) was first impregnated with an aqueous solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 Çœ6H 2 O (Shanghai Chemicals, AR) at room temperature overnight, followed by drying at 120 o C for 6 h, and finally calcined at either 550, 600, 700, or 800 o C for 6 h in an air atmosphere. After calcination, each sample was pressed into a disk, crushed, and sieved to obtain particles in the 0.3Ã­0.45 mm size range for the reform- ing test. The prepared catalysts were identified as Ni/MgO-x, where x is the calcination temperature. For reference, a physical mixture of NiO and MgO was prepared in a mortar, and was designated as NiO+MgO. NiO was synthesized by reacting Ni(NO 3 ) 2 with NH 3 Â·H 2 O which produced a precipitate that was filtered, dried, and calcined at 500 o C for 6 h in air. 1.2 Characterization The crystalline phases of the catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500/PC instrument and Cu K Ä® radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. The XPS determinations were carried out with a Physical Electronics 5500 multitechnique system with a Mg source. Binding energies were corrected for charge effects by refer- ence to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. H 2 -TPR was carried out with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) of a gas chromatograph. For this test 100 mg catalyst was loaded in a quartz tube reactor which was heated from 100 to 800 Â°C at a heating rate of 10 o C/min while being supplied with a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 mixture flowing at 30 ml/min. During reduction, the temperature was maintained at 700 o C for 10 min, and then 800 o C for 10 min to determine the correspond- ing reduction degree of Ni. The H 2 consumption was monitored continuously as a function of reduction temperature by a TCD. The Ni reduction degree was based on the ratio of H 2 consumed per mole of Ni loaded. H 2 chemisorption for quantification of Ni 0 sites was deter- mined with a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument equipped with a quartz U-tube reactor coupled to a thermal conductivity detector. Before the determination, a 500 mg sample was first reduced in a 10% H 2 -90% Ar stream at 700 Â°C for 1 h, then purged with Ar (99.995%) for an extra 15 min and cooled to 40 Â°C. Then 0.5 cm 3 pulses of 10% H 2 -90% Ar were passed through the reactor. The H 2 uptake and Ni surface area were recorded by the AutoChem 2920. Because of differences in the degree of reduction of different catalysts, the degree of dispersion of Ni (D) and the average particle size of the re- duced Ni (d Ni ) were calculated by the following equations [23]: = 1.17X/(WÃ—f) (1) Ni = 97.1/D (2) where X is the H 2 uptake in micromoles per gram of catalyst, W is the weight percentage of nickel, and f is the fraction of nickel reduced to the metal. The Raman spectra were obtained with a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam-HR 800 laser micro-Raman spectrometer at room temperature. The 325 nm line of a He-Cd laser was used as the excitation source during spectroscopy collection. After CO 2 reforming, the amount of coke deposited on the used Ni/MgO catalysts was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the composition of coke was determined by the temperature-programmed oxidation with CO 2 (CO 2 -TPO) method. The used Ni/MgO was pretreated at 500 o C in Ar for 30 min, cooled to 100 o C, and then heated from 100 to 800 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min in 20% O 2 -80% Ar (50 ml/min) for TGA and 5% CO 2 -95% Ar (40 ml/min) for the CO 2 -TPO test. The effluent from the reactor during the CO 2 -TPO test was continuously monitored as a function of sample temperature with a mass spectrometer (Ametek, LC-200). During the test, water vapor was removed by a drier to prevent blockage of the capillary tube which connected the reactor to the mass spec- trometer. KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 1.3 Catalytic activity To determine the catalytic activity of the Ni/MgO catalysts, CO 2 reforming of toluene was carried out in a bench-scale fluidized-bed reactor made of a 9.8-mm-i.d. quartz tube (Fig. 1). A 0.5 ml sample of catalyst (0.3â€“0.45 mm, ~450 mg) was reduced initially at 700 Â°C for 60 min in flowing H 2 and then cooled to 570 Â°C for the following reforming test. During the reforming test, liquid toluene was supplied at a rate of 0.3 ml/h by an HPLC pump (ASI, 501) to a constant temperature evaporator (120 o C) which was also supplied with a gas mix- ture composed of 285 ml/min argon and 14.5 ml/min CO 2 . The resulting mixture of gases was then conducted to the reactor. The reactor effluent gases were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC-6820) equipped with a TDX-101 column and a TCD to determine the H 2 , CO, and CO 2 concen- trations (no detectable light hydrocarbons). However, before entering the TDX-101 column, water vapor and all liquid hy- drocarbons (toluene, benzene, etc.) were removed from the gas mixture. Simultaneously, toluene and a small amount of ben- zene were determined with an HP-5 capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The total toluene conversion (X T ), conversion of toluene to benzene (X T-B ), and the concen- trations of CO, CO 2 , and H 2 at the reactor outlet (P i ) were calculated as follows: X T = [F toluene,in â€“ F toluene,out ]/F toluene,in (3) T-B = F benzene,out /F toluene,in (4) P i = C i,out /Â™C i,out (5) In these expressions, the toluene moles at the reactor inlet and outlet were represented by F toluene,in and F toluene,out , respectively, and were determined by FID. The mole concentration of either CO, H 2 , or CO 2 at the reactor outlet was represented by C i,out . The sum of the CO, H 2 , and CO 2 concentrations on an Ar-free basis was represented by Â™C i,out . 2 Results and discussion 2.1 XRD results The crystalline phases of the catalysts were determined by XRD in Fig. 2. The catalysts calcined at different temperatures ranging from 550 to 800 o C displayed the same diffraction peaks as pure MgO calcined at 700 o C for 6 h. It was apparent that the presence of 5% Ni in the calcined catalysts had little effect on the diffraction profiles. On the other hand, the XRD patterns of NiO+MgO was clearly different because it dis- played twin diffraction peaks at 2È™ = 75 o and 79 o . In each case, the right-hand member of the twin peaks was associated with NiO while the left-hand member was associated with MgO. Because these results showed that a physical mixture of the two Fig. 1.

KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 components containing only 6.4% NiO clearly displayed separate diffraction peaks for each component, the calcination of the impregnated Ni/MgO at temperatures of 500 o C and above was responsible for the disappearance of these peaks. This disappearance indicated a good dispersion of Ni species within Ni/MgO catalysts, probably in the form of a solid solu- tion of NiO in MgO [24]. 2.2 Raman spectra To provide additional insight into the structure and proper- ties of the Ni/MgO catalysts, samples of the calcined catalysts were also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. Samples of pure NiO, pure MgO, and physical mixtures of NiO and MgO (NiO+MgO) were also analyzed for comparison. The results are presented in Fig. 3(a). Interestingly, the pure MgO did not produce any detectable peaks in the Raman spectrum in the probed region from 400 to 2200 cm 1 , which agreed with ear- lier work [19]. In sharp contrast, the pure NiO (~100 nm) spectrum displayed five peaks or bands. In accordance with an earlier study by Mironova-Ulmane et al. [18,19], these bands would have corresponded to a disorder-induced one-phonon (1P) band at 560 cm 1 , two-phonon (2P) bands at 740, 925, and 1100 cm 1 , and a two-magnon (2M) band at 1600 cm 1 . It had also been reported that the 2M band was not obvious when NiO particle size was less than 100 nm [18,25]. Not unexpectedly, the Raman spectrum for the uncalcined NiO+MgO appeared to match the Raman spectrum for NiO since MgO by itself ap- peared to have little effect on the spectrum, which was the main difference from XRD analysis. By comparison the Raman spectra for the calcined Ni/MgO differed greatly from the other profiles in Fig. 3(a), which reflected a strong interaction between NiO and MgO. Upon calcination, three of the peaks disappeared and another peak was greatly reduced in intensity, which suggested that some of the important characteristics of the NiO were lost as it dis- solved in the MgO lattice to form a solid solution [18,19,25]. Of particular interest was the enhancement of the 1P band in the calcined Ni/MgO catalysts in comparison to the cal- cined NiO. From the study by Mironova-Ulmane et al. [18], the intensity of 1P band increased significantly when NiO was anti-ferromagnetically ordered or defect-rich. This suggested that the NiO species in the Ni/MgO catalyst probably contained many defects, which usually improve catalytic performance [24]. In Fig. 3(a), a gradual decrease of the 1P signal took place as the calcination temperature increased, especially at 800 o C, which suggested that the catalytic activity of the cata- lyst decreased as the calcination temperature increased. Because Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique for in- vestigating the surface of a catalyst, and its assumed optical penetration depth is no more than 10 nm when employing an excitation of 325 nm [26], it can be used to confirm the pres- ence of NiO in the outermost layer of a MgO surface. Figure 3(b) shows that after reducing the Ni/MgO catalysts for 1 h at 700 o C, the 2P peak for NiO became very weak, and the 1P band significantly decreased in the intensity also, which suggested that a large amount of the NiO in the outer- most layer of the catalyst was reduced. 2.3 XPS analysis The results of an XPS analysis of the freshly calcined cata- lysts (in Table 1) showed that the binding energy of Ni 2p was higher in Ni/MgO than in pure NiO, and it increased with increasing calcination temperature. The increase in binding energy indicated a stronger interaction between NiO-MgO, which could have been due to the formation of a solid solution structure. If the Ni/MgO formed an ideal NiO-MgO solid solution (NiO dispersed well in MgO), the overall atomic ratio of Ni/Mg would be 3.6% for a Ni loading of 5%. However, the XPS analysis of the surface of Ni/MgO catalysts showed the Ni/MgO ratio decreased from 7.5% to 6.1% as the calcination temperature increased from 550 to 800 o C (Table 1). This result seems to have been explained by Wang et al. [14] who showed that nickel oxide particles would diffuse from the outermost layer into a deeper layer to form a more stable structure during high temperature calcination, which would result in a Ni concentration gradient. 0 7000 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 200 MgO NiO NiO+MgO Ni/MgO-800 Ni/MgO-700 Ni/MgO-600 2M 2P 2P2P I n t e n s i t y Wavenumber (cm 1 ) (a) 1P Ni/MgO-550 Ni/MgO-800 Ni/MgO-700 Ni/MgO-600 Ni/MgO-550 2P I n t e n s i t y (b) 1P Fig. 3.

KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 In other words, the NiO species would diffuse from the surface of the catalyst into the depths of the catalyst during calcination resulting in a higher Ni/Mg ratio at the surface. At a higher calcination temperature, more NiO diffused into the inner catalyst, which explained the gradual decrease of NiO scatting signals in the Raman spectra in Fig. 3(a). 2.4 H 2 -TPR study The reducibility of the Ni/MgO catalysts was determined by employing H 2 -TPR to determine the H 2 consumed to reduce nickel oxide in the calcined samples of the catalysts. Figure 4 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles for catalysts calcined at different temperatures. In each H 2 -TPR test, the temperature was held constant for 10 min at 700 and 800 o C to obtain an accurate indication of the degree of Ni reduction at these temperatures. It had been reported previously that during H 2 -TPR of Ni/MgO catalyst, the reduction of Ni 2+ ions in the outermost layer and sub-surface layers of the MgO lattice took place between 400 and 700 o C, whereas, the reduction of Ni 2+ ions in the MgO matrix took place at 800 o C or higher [17,27]. These tempera- ture regions are referred to below as the first and second re- duction zones, respectively. From the XPS analysis (Table 1), it was known that the in- teraction between NiO and MgO became stronger with in- creasing calcination temperature, which changed the H 2 -TPR profiles (Fig. 4). In the first reduction zone, the H 2 -TPR pro- files became smoother and smaller with increasing calcination temperature. In the second zone centered around 800 o C, the peak height decreased gradually with increasing calcination temperature. All these observations showed that a higher cal- cination temperature increased the interaction between NiO and MgO, which made NiO more difficult to reduce (Table 2). The presence of the Raman 1P scattering peak after Ni/MgO was reduced indicated that a small amount of NiO was still present in the sub-surface layer of the catalyst, so it can be concluded that the reduction of the NiO species by the H 2 -TPR process took place on the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, a higher calcination temperature which caused more NiO to diffuse into the inner structure of the Ni/MgO catalyst [14] would cause less NiO to be reduced. 2.5 H 2 chemisorption analysis From Raman spectroscopy and H 2 -TPR results, only a small part of the NiO on the surface of the Ni/MgO catalyst was reduced, so no diffraction peaks for metallic Ni on the reduced catalysts were observed by XRD characterization (not shown). H 2 chemisorption was employed to study the reduced Ni. After reduction at 700 o C for 1 h, pulse chemisorption of H 2 was conducted at 40 o C and the results are listed in Table 3. In the H 2 -TPR study, the reduced amount of Ni (or reduction degree) varied inversely with the calcination temperature. However, the H 2 uptake which reflected the active amount of surface Ni did not change with the reduction degree linearly Table 1 XPS analysis of the freshly calcined Ni/MgO catalysts Surface concentration a (atm%) Sample Binding energy of Ni 2p (eV) Ni Mg Surface Ni/Mg ratio Ni/Mg overall b (%) NiO 853.7 â€” â€” â€” n.d.

KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 because of the different interaction forces in Ni/MgO catalysts. The Ni/MgO-600 had the highest H 2 uptake (3.9 È�mol/g), followed by Ni/MgO-550 and Ni/MgO-700. Ni/MgO-800 had the smallest H 2 uptake (1.3 È�mol/g). The dispersion of Ni which is the ratio of the surface Ni content to the reduced Ni content, increased from 5.3% to 10.1% with increasing calcination temperature, whereas, the average particle size of the reduced Ni decreased from 18.3 to 9.6 nm. This result matched the published data [17]. A weaker interaction between Ni and MgO caused the Ni particles to grow during high temperature reduction. 2.6 Catalytic performance The performance of the prepared Ni/MgO catalysts was determined by reforming toluene with CO 2 at 570 o C using a CO 2 /toluene molar ratio of 14 and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 36000 h 1 . The catalysts which had been initially calcined at different temperature ranging from 550 to 800 o C were reduced with H 2 at 700 o C before each test. Some of the results of this series of tests are presented in Fig. 5. It showed that the highest initial conversion of toluene (89.1%) was achieved with the catalyst initially calcined at 600 o C, while the lowest conversion (15.7%) was achieved with Ni/MgO initially calcined at 800 o C. The other two catalysts produced overlap- ping results with the total toluene conversion of ~73%. For this series of tests the initial conversion of toluene varied linearly with the Ni surface area in Fig. 6. However, since the Ni surface area was directly proportional to the surface Ni content (Table 4), the initial conversion also varied directly with the surface Ni amount. On the other hand, although Ni/MgO-800 had the smallest Ni particle size (9.6 nm), its activity based on toluene conversion (Table 4) was much lower than that of any of the other catalysts with a larger Ni particle size (Fig. 7), therefore the Ni surface area or the surface Ni amount in Ni/MgO catalysts was the key factor affecting catalytic activity. During CO 2 reforming, CO and H 2 were the principal products, and their Ar-free concentrations are listed in Table 4. It was easy to understand why the CO and H 2 concentrations decreased as the conversion of toluene decreased. For Ni/MgO catalysts calcined between 550 and 700 o C, the CO/H 2 molar ratio was nearly constant, whereas, for Ni/MgO calcined at 800 o C, the CO/H 2 molar ratio was smaller. This could have been due either to the reverse water gas shift reaction which was suppressed or because of the decomposition of CO which 01234567 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 (4) (3) (1) (2) Time on stream (h) T o l u e n e c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) Fig. 5.

KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 produces coke (Table 4). While the activity of Ni/MgO cata- lysts was high initially, it tended to decline with usage. In Fig. 5, the conversion of toluene on Ni/MgO dropped more rapidly in the first 3 h, and then more gradually during the next 4â€“7 h. In a long-term test of Ni/MgO-600 catalyst (Fig. 8), the con- version of toluene decreased rapidly during the first 6 h, but it decreased very slowly in the next 6â€“30 h. This is a normal observation in reforming, where catalysts can be stabilized by the development of a more stable structure. During a stabili- zation period, the Ni particle size may increase slightly, and some coke may also be formed [28,29]. However, in the pre- sent study, the structural change was slight and there was no obvious difference between the reduced and used Ni/MgO catalyst when examined by XRD analysis. By comparison to the results achieved with Ni/MgO-600, in a similar test with Ni/MgO-550, the catalyst did not stabilize during the test (Fig. 5 and Table 4). This result was due most likely to the lower temperature used for calcining the catalyst, when the Ni/MgO catalyst was calcined at 800 o C, it has al- ready been shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4 that the catalyst was stabilized very quickly, but at a much lower level than ob- served initially. 2.7 The reasons for deactivation of Ni/MgO-800 Generally, the reasons for the deactivation of Ni catalysts include a structural change of the catalyst, sintering of Ni par- ticles, and coking [20]. Coking is of greatest concern because it can quickly deactivate catalysts as the reduced metal sites are covered [30,31]. Table 4 indicated the amount of coke deposited on the cata- lysts during a 7 h reforming test at 570 o C. Ni/MgO-800 cata- lyst collected the most coke (0.8 wt%). Seo et al. [32] reported a similar result with a nickel-alumina catalyst used for steam reforming of liquefied natural gas. A catalyst calcined at a higher temperature lost its activity because of heavy coking. Usually, the smaller Ni particle size found on the Ni/MgO-800 catalyst would facilitate the dissociation of hy- drocarbons [33]. Therefore if the dissociated toluene can be removed quickly by CO 2 , a high and stable activity would be obtained. According to an investigation of methane reforming with CO 2 conducted by Tomishige et al. [34], the rapid oxida- tion of the dissociated CH x on a reduced Ni surface by the oxidizing species produced by activation of CO 2 at a metal-support interface is a key step in the stable conversion of methane. Because the Ni/MgO-800 catalyst appeared to have an inadequate number of active Ni sites, the active catalyst surface for the oxidation of dissociated toluene was insuffi- cient. As a result, coke would accumulate in the reforming process. Another reforming test conducted with Ni/MgO-700 at a high flow rate of toluene supported this conclusion (re- forming conditions: 570 o C, 0.008 ml/min toluene, CO 2 /toluene molar ratio of 21). After a 7 h test, the Ni/MgO-700 catalyst was covered with 8.8 wt% coke because of insufficient surface Ni. The H 2 -TPR test results reported in Table 2 had shown that the reduction degree of Ni on Ni/MgO-800 catalyst was just 3.1% at 700 o C, so even a small amount of coke would have covered the reduced Ni particles during a catalyst perform- ance test and caused deactivation. It was not easy to detect a small amount of coke by a CO 2 -TPO test [15], but Raman spectroscopy provided interesting information even for carbon contents less than 1% [22]. Figure 9 indicates the Raman spectra for coke on Ni/MgO catalysts. There are two distinct bands, one located at 1590 1600 cm 1 and another at 1380 1400 cm 1 . Because there are no peaks at about 3000 cm 1 , which is the classic peak for aromatic compounds, the present peaks can be assigned to represent coke. Usually, the former band is named the G band which not only represents the classic Raman signal for pure-carbon graphite, but also represents all polyaromatic carbonaceous matter. The latter band is named the D band which is often induced by the defects in graphite [22,35]. 0 3 6 9 12151821242730 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Conversion of tolunene H 2 concentration CO concentration T o l u e n e c o n v e r s i o n o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n ( % ) Time on stream (h) CO 2 concentration Fig. 8.

Raman spectra of used Ni/MgO catalysts after reforming tests at 570 o C. KONG Meng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1508â€“1516 According to Chua and Stair [36], if the intensity of the G band is significantly smaller than that of the D band, the spec- trum may be caused by polyaromatic compounds with a two-dimensional, sheet-like topology (pyrene and coronene). By contrast, if the intensity of the two bands is more nearly equal, the spectrum may be an indication of polynuclear aro- matics with a chainlike topology (phenanthrene, anthrancene, and pentacene). In any case the present results suggested that the coke on Ni/MgO contained hydrogen atoms which came from the dissociation of toluene. A CO 2 -TPO-MS test of the used Ni/MgO-700 catalyst with 8.8 wt% coke conducted at a high feed rate of toluene (0.008 ml/min toluene, CO 2 /toluene molar ratio of 21, 570 o C) showed the presence of hydrogen in the coke formation (not shown). The relative intensity ratio of I D /I G is a useful parameter for measuring the degree of graphitization of the coke; a high I D /I G suggests a low degree of graphitization [37]. For Ni/MgO calcined at a higher temperature, the ratio of I D /I G was slightly higher than that of Ni/MgO calcined at a lower temperature (0.46 vs 0.43), which indicated a low concentration of graph- ite-like coke. Meanwhile, visible shifts of the D and G bands were observed with increasing calcination temperature, the D band shifted to a smaller wavenumber from 1400 to 1390 cm 1 , while the G band shifted from 1590 to 1600 cm 1 . Such shifts suggest a small graphite-like domain resulting from increasing calcination temperature [38] which matches the result from the discussion of I D /I G . 3 Conclusions Ni supported on MgO is a very effective catalyst for CO 2 reforming of toluene. A catalyst was prepared by a three-step process that involved impregnating MgO with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 , cal- cining the material, and reducing the resulting samples with H 2 . The temperature employed for calcination is a key parameter for the concentration of surface Ni and 600 o C is nearly opti- mum. When material calcined at this temperature was reduced with H 2 , the resulting catalyst had the highest concentration of Ni on the surface of the MgO support, and it also had the highest catalytic activity when tested. Material calcined at 800 o C had an increasing amount of NiO dissolved in the MgO to form a solid solution (NiO-MgO) that could not be reduced, and also suffered a loss in catalytic activity because of a larger amount of coke. In the future, the performance and life of the catalyst will be investigated for different application condi- tions, and the reasons for catalytic deactivation will be studied further.

Tel/Fax: +86-571-88273283 A Ni/MgO catalyst for CO2 reforming of toluene was prepared by impregnating MgO with Ni(NO3)2. During calcination, some of the NiO diffused into the MgO and formed a solid solution structure of NiO-MgO, which was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. In the temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen analysis, only a small part of the Ni species in the outermost layer was reduced to metallic Ni at 700 °C. The calcination temperature played a key role in determining the subsequent catalytic activity of Ni/MgO, consequently the catalyst calcined at 600 °C had the highest activity. This catalyst also had the highest surface concentration of reduced Ni, which probably accounted for its high activity. During the reforming tests, a small amount of coke was deposited on Ni/MgO catalyst. Polyaromatic compounds were observed by Raman spectroscopy. The coke was probably responsible for the activity loss of Ni/MgO. ﻿摘要 ﻿考察了焙烧温度对 Ni/MgO 催化剂结构及其在甲苯二氧化碳重整反应中催化性能的影响. 由于 NiO-MgO 固溶体的形成, 样品的 X 射线衍射谱中没有出现明显的 NiO 衍射峰, 而在拉曼光谱中出现明显的散射信号. X 射线光电子能谱、氢气程序升温还原和 H2 脉冲吸附结果表明, 高温焙烧过程中 Ni 向催化剂体相扩散, 与 MgO 发生强互相互作用, 使得 Ni 物种难以还原, 但部分位于催化剂表面的 Ni 物种能够还原; 高温焙烧后催化剂表面活性 Ni 物种明显减少, 致使催化剂重整活性降低. 重整反应后, 催化剂表面存在少量多核芳烃类积炭, 这很可能是高温焙烧催化剂稳定性差的原因.

        "dc:description": "A Ni/MgO catalyst for CO2 reforming of toluene was prepared by impregnating MgO with Ni(NO3)2. During calcination, some of the NiO diffused into the MgO and formed a solid solution structure of NiO-MgO, which was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. In the temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen analysis, only a small part of the Ni species in the outermost layer was reduced to metallic Ni at 700 °C. The calcination temperature played a key role in determining the subsequent catalytic activity of Ni/MgO, consequently the catalyst calcined at 600 °C had the highest activity. This catalyst also had the highest surface concentration of reduced Ni, which probably accounted for its high activity. During the reforming tests, a small amount of coke was deposited on Ni/MgO catalyst. Polyaromatic compounds were observed by Raman spectroscopy. The coke was probably responsible for the activity loss of Ni/MgO.",
