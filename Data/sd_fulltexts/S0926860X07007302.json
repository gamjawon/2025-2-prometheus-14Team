Ethylene trithiocarbonate (ETTC) was synthesized in good to excellent yields and selectivities from a one-pot catalytic reaction of ethylene carbonate (EC) and CS2 in the presence of a lithium halide by using EC as a source of ethylene oxide (EO). The selectivity of ETTC was strongly affected by the rate of EC decomposition into EO and CO2. Lithium chloride, the least active catalyst for the EC decomposition, showed the highest yield and selectivity.

Keywords Ethylene carbonate Ethylene trithiocarbonate Cyclic trithiocarbonate Cyclic carbonate Ethylene oxide Ionic liquids 1 Introduction Cyclic trithiocarbonates including ethylene trithiocarbonate (ETTC) have received much attention due to their biological activity and utilization as raw materials in many organic syntheses and pharmaceuticals [1–7]. Recently, there has also been an increasing demand for ETTC in lithium batteries as an electrolyte additive for the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the electrode, thereby improving the cycle performance and the stability of the batteries [8–12]. However, the extensive application of ETTC as a raw material or as an electrolyte additive has been restricted due to the lack of an economically feasible process for manufacturing ETTC. Similar to the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from the coupling reactions of epoxides with carbon dioxide [13–18], most of the cyclic trithiocarbonates other than ETTC can be easily prepared from the coupling reaction of epoxides with carbon disulfide (CS2). However, the synthesis of ETTC from the reaction of ethylene oxide (EO) with CS2 has serious drawbacks such as the difficulty in the handling of explosive EO and the formation of large amounts of polymeric side products arising from the highly exothermic reactions [19–22]. ETTC has also been prepared by the reaction of 2-chloroethanol or 1,2-dichloroethane with K2CS3, an expensive starting material [23]. In a previous article, we reported that imidazolium zinc tetrahalide catalysts [3-methyl-1-R-imidazolium]2ZnX2Y2 (R=alkyl; X, Y=Cl, Br), were highly effective for the coupling reaction of EO with CO2 to produce ethylene carbonate (EC) in excellent yield and selectivity [24,25]. Interestingly, it was also observed that these catalysts slowly decomposed EC into EO and CO2 during the vacuum distillation to separate EC from the product mixture [26]. Being motivated by these results, we have attempted to use EC as a source of EO in the synthesis of ETTC. We hoped that the concentration of EO in the reaction mixture can be controlled to a certain extent through such catalyst-assisted decomposition of EC. By supplying EO slowly, one can maintain the molar ratio of CS2/EO high enough to prevent the excessive heat evolution, thereby suppressing the polymerization of EO and eliminating the danger of explosion caused by the use of large quantities of EO as the reactant. In the present study, we report a convenient and selective synthesis of ETTC by the reaction of EC with CS2 in the presence of a catalyst. 2 Experimental EC, CS2, lithium halides, 1-methylimidazole, zinc halides, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, CH3CN, CH3OH, dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as received. Ethylene sulfide (ES) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) were obtained from TCI Co. Ltd. Imidazolium zinc tetrahalide complexes were prepared according to the reported procedures [25]. 2.1 Catalysis reactions All the reactions were conducted in a 100mL stainless steel bomb reactor equipped with a magnetic bar and an electric heater. The reactor was charged with CS2, EC, an appropriate catalyst, and a solvent, and pressurized with N2 (g) to approximately 2.0MPa. The reactor was then heated to a specified temperature. After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the liquid and gaseous products were analyzed by GC (Agilent 6890) and GC–Mass (Agilent 5975) equipped with HP-5 columns (30m×0.32m×0.25μm). 2.2 Decomposition test Decomposition of EC was carried out in a Schlenk tube under an argon atmosphere. The Schlenk tube was charged with an appropriate catalyst and EC (molar ratio of EC/catalyst=20) and then immersed in an oil bath maintained at 150°C. After 1h, the tube was cooled down to room temperature and the degree of decomposition was evaluated by the weight loss of EC. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst screening ETTC was prepared from the reaction of EC with CS2 in the presence of an imidazolium zinc tetrahalide catalyst. As can be seen in Table 1 , the reactions of EC with two equivalents of CS2, performed in DMF at 150°C for 4h using [EMIm]2ZnBr2Cl2 or [EMIm]2ZnBr4 (EMIm=3-ethyl-1-methylimidazolium) as a catalyst, produced ethylene monothiocarbonate (EMTC), ETTC, and polymeric side products. The formation of large amounts of polymers can be ascribed to the rapid decomposition of EC into EO and CO2 by the presence of an imidazolium zinc tetrahalide catalyst, thereby increasing the concentration of EO in the reaction mixture and consequently facilitating the co-polymerization of EO and CS2 [27]. Even though the selectivity to ETTC is not yet high enough, these results strongly support our postulate that EC can be utilized as a source of EO through a catalyst-assisted decomposition. With a hope to find more selective catalysts, we have tested the activities of various types of catalysts used for the coupling reaction of EO and CO2 and found that lithium halides (LiX; X=Cl, Br, I) are effective for the selective production of ETTC. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 , LiCl, the least active catalyst for the synthesis of EC from the coupling reaction, exhibited the highest activity and selectivity, producing ETTC almost quantitatively. The most likely reason for such a high selectivity toward ETTC is the very slow decomposition of EC in the presence of LiCl. 3.1.1 Coupling reaction of EO and CS2 As mentioned earlier, it is conceivable that the formation of polymeric side products could be suppressed to a large extent by maintaining the molar ratio of CS2/EO in the reaction mixture as high as possible, and this can be achieved by reducing the rate of EC decomposition using a suitable catalyst. This assumption is somewhat supported by the following two experiments. The coupling reactions of EO and CS2 were conducted with LiCl in DMF at 150°C for 2h at various molar ratios of CS2/EO. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , the selectivity of ETTC increased with the increase of the molar ratio, whereas the amounts of polymeric side products decreased with increasing molar ratio of CS2/EO, indicating that the polymerization between EO and CS2 is strongly influenced by the concentration of EO. 3.1.2 Decomposition of EC Decomposition tests, performed at 150°C in DMF at the EC/catalyst molar ratio of 20, also supported our postulate. As illustrated in Table 3 , almost no decomposition of EC was observed in the absence of a catalyst. However, EC decomposition was considerably accelerated by the presence of a catalyst. The rate of EC decomposition was strongly dependent on the catalyst employed. As expected, EC decomposed most slowly in the presence of LiCl. The degree of EC decomposition was found to be in the order of [EMIm]2ZnCl2Br2 ≫LiI>LiBr≫LiCl. 3.2 Effect of reaction time and temperature Effects of reaction time on the formation of ETTC were investigated in DMF at 150°C. The molar ratio of EC/CS2/LiCl was set at 20/40/1. As can be seen in Fig. 2 , the conversion of EC increased rapidly with time up to 2h and thereafter remained nearly constant at around 99%. The selectivity of ETTC gradually increased as the reaction progressed, but at the cost of the loss of EMTC selectivity, suggesting that EMTC is an intermediate to ETTC. Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on the reaction of EC and CS2 in DMF at the molar ratio of EC/CS2/LiCl=20/40/1. The conversion of EC and the selectivity of ETTC increased with increasing temperature, whereas the selectivity of EMTC decreased with the rise of temperature. At relatively lower temperatures of 100 and 120°C, the sum of selectivities of EMTC and ETTC is far below 100%, indicating the presence of unknown intermediate species. Many attempts were made to isolate and to characterize these species, but all failed. The intermediate species seem to exist only at lower temperatures; they are then transformed into ETTC, because the sum of selectivities reached over 99% at elevated temperatures of 140°C and above. It is interesting to observe that the product mixtures contain only trace amounts of ethylene dithiocarbonate (EDTC), even though alkylene dithiocarbonate is one of the primary products formed by the reaction of a substituted ethylene oxide with CS2 [20]. It is believed that, unlike other alkylene dithiocarbonates, EDTC is rather unstable under the experimental conditions, and therefore decomposes readily into carbonyl sulfide (COS) and ES [28]. In fact, GC–mass analysis of a product mixture confirmed the formation of COS, ES, and CO2. 3.3 Effect of molar ratio of EC/LiCl The effect of molar ratio of EC/LiCl on the reaction of EC and CS2 was studied at various temperatures. The molar ratio of EC to LiCl was varied over the range 10–100 and the results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 . The conversion of EC and the selectivity of ETTC decreased continuously with the increase of the molar ratio, irrespective of the reaction temperature. On the contrary, the selectivity of EMTC increased with increasing molar ratio. 3.4 Effect of solvent Among various factors affecting the selectivity of ETTC, the solvent effect was most pronounced. As can be seen in Table 4 , high EC conversion and ETTC selectivity were obtained when the reaction was carried out in a solvent such as DMF or NMP that can dissolve both CS2 and LiCl. On the contrary, the reaction in CH3OH or CH3CN showed poor EC conversion and ETTC selectivity, possibly because these solvents are immiscible with CS2 and, therefore, the reaction progresses in a heterogeneous way. The reaction in a CS2-miscible solvent, 1,2-dicholobenzene, also exhibited low conversion and poor selectivity, which can be ascribed to the insolubility of LiCl in the solvent. 3.5 Reaction mechanism From the experimental results, we conclude that the most plausible reaction mechanism for the formation of ETTC can be depicted as shown in Fig. 6 . The LiX-assisted EC decomposition into EO and CO2 takes place first. The next step is likely to be the ring opening of EO by the nucleophilic attack of X− on the carbon atom of EO. A following attack of the negatively charged oxygen atom of the EO moiety on the carbon atom of CS2 and the subsequent rearrangement will lead to the formation of EDTC and LiX. Similarly, EDTC can decompose into COS and ES, which in turn undergo ring opening by LiX. A subsequent attack of a negatively charged sulfur atom of ES moiety on the carbon atom of CS2 will lead to the formation of ETTC. The intermediate EMTC can be produced either by the interaction between EO and COS or by the interaction between ES with CO2. However, as suggested by Endo and co-workers, the mechanism involving a lithium xanthate, formed from the interaction between lithium halide and CS2, cannot be ruled out [27]. 4 Conclusion ETTC was prepared from the one-pot reaction of EC with CS2 in the presence of a catalyst, where EC was used as a source of EO. The selectivity of ETTC was strongly correlated with the activity of the catalyst with respect to EC decomposition into EO and CO2. With a less active catalyst for the decomposition, the concentration of EO can be maintained low enough to prevent the polymerization of EO with CS2, thereby improving ETTC selectivity. Among the catalysts tested, LiCl, the least active catalyst for the decomposition of EC, showed the highest ETTC selectivity. By using the method developed by us, ETTC can be conveniently prepared in high yield and selectivity, without any danger of an explosion arising from the use of large quantities of EO as the reactant.
