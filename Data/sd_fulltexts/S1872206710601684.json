DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60168-4 Monolayer Dispersed Ru-Zn Catalyst and Its Performance in the Selective Hydrogenation of Benzene to Cyclohexene SUN Haijie, ZHANG Xudong, CHEN Zhihao, ZHOU Xiaoli, GUO Wei, LIU Zhongyi*, LIU Shouchang Department of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China Abstract: A series of Ru-Zn catalysts with different Zn loadings were prepared by co-precipitation. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy results showed that a large part of the Zn in the Ru-Zn catalysts were present in the form of ZnO and the ZnO on the catalyst surface could react with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form a basic zinc sulfate salt during hydrogenation. The content of the basic salt increased with an increase in the Zn loading of the catalysts. This resulted in a decrease in catalyst activity and an increase in selectivity for cyclohexene. When the Zn loading was 8.6%, the basic salt dispersion was close to monolayer dispersion on the catalyst surface. When the catalysts were pretreated in the presence of 0.6 mol/L ZnSO 4 solution at 140 Â°C and at 5 MPa H 2 , a cyclohexene selectivity of 69.8% and a benzene conversion of 84.4% was achieved after 20 min. Key words: monolayer dispersion; ruthenium; zinc; benzene; selective hydrogenation; cyclohexene The production of nylon-6 and nylon-66 from benzene and cyclohexene has attracted much attention because it is a envi- ronmentally benign process with a good atom economy [1]. In 1989, the Asahi Chemical Industry Co. industrialized the process for producing cyclohexene from the selective hydro- genation of benzene based on unsupported Ru-Zn catalysts and nanosized ZrO 2 as a dispersant, and a cyclohexene selectivity of 80% as well as a benzene conversion of 40% were obtained [2,3]. The technology has been sold in China by Asahi Chemical Industry Co. but the details of this process have never been released. Therefore, scientific studies on catalyst preparation and modification are needed. Promoters greatly impact the performance of catalysts. It has been reported that promoters such as K, Fe, Co, Ce, Ba, La, and Zn can remarkably enhance the selectivity for cyclohexene [2,4â€“11] and Zn has been regarded as the best promoter. It has been proposed that the ZnO in the precursor of the catalyst or the Zn 2+ chemisorbed on metallic Ru can be reduced to their elemental state by hydrogen atoms, which spill over from metallic Ru. The interaction between metallic zinc and metallic Ru can lead to a decrease in the activity of the catalyst and an increase in cyclohexene production. It has also been suggested that an optimal Zn loading exists for the Ru-based catalyst and it is closely related to the concentration of Zn 2+ in the slurry [11]. However, methods to determine the optimal Zn loading as well as the relationship between the Zn in the catalysts and Zn 2+ in the slurry have not been reported. Monolayer dispersed catalysts have excellent catalytic per- formance [12]. We prepared a series of Ru-based catalysts with different Zn loadings. The features of the monolayer dispersed Ru-Zn catalysts were determined, their catalytic performance was investigated and the link between the Zn in the catalysts and Zn 2+ in the slurry were clarified. The Ru-Zn catalysts were prepared according to a literature procedure [13]. A desired amount of RuCl 3 Â·H 2 O and ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O were dissolved in 200 ml H 2 O with agitation. To the stirred solution, 200 ml 20% NaOH solution was added instantly and the resulting mixture was agitated for an addi- tional 4 h at 80 Â°C. The mixture was left to stand and the ob- tained black precipitate was wash three times with an aqueous solution of 5% NaOH after the supernatant had been removed by decantation. This black precipitate was dispersed in 400 ml 5% NaOH solution and charged into a 1 L Teflon-lined auto- clave. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave to raise the total internal pressure to 5 MPa and the reduction was con- ducted at 150 Â°C and 800 r/min stirring for 3 h. The reaction SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 224â€“230 mixture was cooled and the obtained black powder was washed three times with 5% NaOH and then with water until neutral to give the desired Ru-Zn catalysts. The amount of ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O was adjusted to give the desired Zn loading. The catalysts with different Zn loadings were denoted as Ru-Zn(x) where x indi- cates the Zn loading, as determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The selective hydrogenation of benzene was performed in a 1 L hastelloy-lined autoclave. The catalyst (1.96 g) was pre- treated for 22 h in the presence of 280 ml H 2 O containing 49.2 g ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O and 9.8 g ZrO 2 at 150 o C, and with a H 2 pres- sure of 5 MPa as well as a stirring rate of 800 r/min. 140 ml of benzene was then added to the reactor at 150 o C and the stirring rate was increased to 1400 r/min to exclude any external dif- fusion effect and the reaction time began. A small amount of reaction mixture was sampled every 5 min and sent for gas chromatographic analysis (FID detector), and the benzene conversion and cyclohexene selectivity were calculated. The direct hydrogenation followed the above operation except for a 22 h pretreatment. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a PAN Nalytcal XÆ�Pert PRO instrument. The X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The spectra were collected in the 2È™ range from 20Â°â€“80Â° with a step of 0.03Â°. AAS was per- formed on a Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 300 instrument operating at Èœ = 213.9 nm and with a slit width of 0.20 nm to determine the Zn loading. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical state of the surface Zn on a PHI Quantera SXM instrument with a base pressure of 6.7 Ã— 10 â€“8 Pa. Al K Ä® (E b = 1 486.6 eV) was used as the excitation radia- tion. Calibration of the spectra was done on a spurious C 1s peak and it was fixed at 284.5 eV. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Ru-Zn catalysts before and after hydrogenation. Figure 1 shows that the pat- terns of all samples contain six characteristic peaks of metallic Ru at 2È™ values of 38.4Â°, 44.0Â°, 58.3Â°, 69.4Â°, 78.4Â°, and 84.7Â° (JCPDS 010-070-0274). The crystallite sizes of the Ru in the catalysts estimated from the strongest peak broadening at 44.0Â° using the Scherrer equation are 4.1, 4.3, 3.8, 3.7, 3.9, 4.3, 4.0, 3.8, and 3.8 nm, respectively. Apart from the above-mentioned peaks the Ru-Zn(29.1%) catalyst has seven new peaks at 2È™ values of 31.8Â°, 34.4Â°, 36.3Â°, 47.5Â°, 56.6Â°, 62.9Â°, and 68.0Â° that correspond to the ZnO phase (JCPDS 010-070-2551). This indicates that a part of the Zn in the catalysts exist in the form of ZnO. By comparison with ZrO 2 all the peaks are assigned to the main phase except for the peaks at 2È™ values of 8.09Â°, 16.2Â°, and 44.0Â°, as shown in Fig. 1. The wide and weak peak at the 2È™ value of 44.0Â° corresponds to the metallic Ru phase (JCPDS 010-070-0274) indicating a small crystallite size for Ru. The peaks at 2È™ values of 8.09Â° and 16.2Â° are attributed to the ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O phase (JCPDS 00-009-0204). This suggests that the ZnO in the catalyst reacted with ZnSO 4 in the slurry to form a basic zinc sulfate salt. Peaks of the basic zinc sulfate salt appear and gradually increase in intensity indicating that the amount of this basic salt increases with the Zn loading. Figure 2 shows XPS spectra of the Ru-Zn(8.6%) sample before and after hydrogenation. The binding energies of Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 in the Ru-Zn(8.6%) sample before hydrogenation was 1021.9 and 1044.9 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the binding energies of Zn 2p 3/2 in the ZnO and Ag/ZnO cata- lysts at 1021.9 and 1021.8 eV, respectively, as reported in the literature [14]. This indicates that a part of the Zn in the Ru-Zn(8.6%) sample exists as ZnO. However, ZnO was not detected by XRD in the other samples except for the 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2T/( o ) ZnO Ru (10) I n t e n s i t y (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (a) ZnSO 4 g 3Zn(OH) 2 g 4H 2 O Ru I n t e n s i t y 2T/( o ) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (b) Fig. 1.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 224â€“230 Ru-Zn(29.1%) sample because of its low quantities and high dispersion while the smaller crystallite sizes were under the detectable limit of the instrument. At a Zn loading of 8.6% the basic salt dispersion is close to a monolayer dispersion. This is one of the important features of the monolayer dispersed Ru-Zn catalyst. Obviously, the basic salt is composed of a bond between the ZnO in the catalysts and the ZnSO 4 in the slurry. The Zn loading and the concentration of Zn 2+ in the slurry can affect the formation and the composi- tion of the basic salt and subsequently the performance of the catalysts is influenced. This is in good agreement with the conclusions reported in the literature about the optimal Zn loading being closely related to the concentration of Zn 2+ in the slurry. The binding energy of Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2 in the Ru-Zn(8.6%) sample after hydrogenation was found to be 1022.5 and 1045.5, respectively, which is 0.7 and 0.6 eV higher than that before hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 2. We further confirm that a large part of the Zn is still present in the form of Zn 2+ and cannot be reduced further. This indicates that there is a strong interaction between ZnO on the catalyst surface and Zn 2+ in the slurry as well as the dispersant ZrO 2 , which results in a change in the Zn electronic state. The catalytic performance of the Ru-Zn catalysts with dif- ferent Zn loadings for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the activity of the catalysts decreases and the cyclohexene selectivity in- creases with an increase in Zn loading, which is consistent with the results reported by Hu et al. [13]. A test without the addition of ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O was also carried out. The results showed that on the Ru-Zn(9.6%) catalyst the cyclohexene selectivity is only 1.4% and the benzene conversion is 98.2% after 10 min and this was slightly higher than the cyclohexene selectivity (1.4%) and the benzene conversion (99.2%) over the Ru-Zn(0) cata- lyst. However, over the former catalyst the cyclohexene selec- tivity reached 80.9% at a benzene conversion of 45.1% in the presence of ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O. This indicates that the Ru-Zn cata- lyst gives excellent cyclohexene selectivity with the synergic action of Zn on the catalyst surface and ZnSO 4 Â·7H 2 O in the slurry. Therefore, ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O plays a key role in the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene: (1) ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O is an insoluble salt and is more easily chemisorbed on the catalyst surface than ZnSO 4 . The large amount of Zn 2+ and rich crystal water can especially enhance the hydrophilicity of the catalyst and this leads to an increase in cyclohexene selectivity [15]; (2) ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O can block the active sites that are not suitable for the formation of cyclohexene; (3) The interaction between Zn 2+ in ZnSO 4 Â·3Zn(OH) 2 Â·7H 2 O and the active Ru component can modify the electronic structure of Ru. The ZnO or Zn 2+ that are chemisorbed on the Ru active centers can be reduced to their elemental state by hydrogen atoms, which spilled over from metallic Ru. Ru-based catalysts modified by metallic Zn are suitable for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclo- hexene [10,11]. However, no Zn peaks were detected because of the small crystallite sizes and the formation of a Ru-Zn solid solution [18]. All of these are important reasons that lead to a decrease in the activity of the catalysts and an increase in cyclohexene selectivity with an increase in the Zn loading. When the Zn loadings increase from 8.6% to 9.6%, the activity of the catalysts decrease drastically, however, the selectivity for cyclohexene increases slightly. This contributes to the monolayer dispersion of the basic salts on the catalyst with a Zn loading of 8.6%.

SUN Haijie et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 224â€“230 monolayer dispersion of the Ru-Zn catalyst, catalysts with the Zn loading of 7.7%, 8.6%, and 9.6% were pretreated and the results are shown in Fig. 4. After the pretreatment, the catalysts with a Zn loading of 8.6% exhibited moderate activity and the best cyclohexene selectivity. Moreover, cyclohexene selectiv- ity decreased slowly with an increase in benzene conversion. A cyclohexene selectivity of 69.8% and a benzene conversion of 84.4% were obtained for this catalyst. The activity of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 7.7% was higher than that of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 8.6% while the cyclohexene selectivity of the latter was much higher than that of the former. Although the initial selectivity of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 9.6% was higher than that of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 8.6%, the latter had a higher activity than the former. More- over, the cyclohexene selectivity of the latter decreased more slowly than that of the former with an increase in benzene conversion. This indicates that the monolayer dispersion cata- lyst had the best catalytic performance, which is in agreement with reference [12]. This also indicates that the role of the pretreatment is as follows: (1) After the pretreatment, hydrogen was preferentially adsorbed on the most active sites and ben- zene was only adsorbed on the moderately active sites. This benefited the activation of benzene and also the desorption of cyclohexene [16]; (2) The pretreatment resulted in the pas- sivation and structural stability of the catalyst, which pro- longed the life of the catalyst [17]; (3) The pretreatment shifted the pore distribution to larger pores, which promoted the de- sorption of cyclohexene and improved cyclohexene selectivity [17]. The pretreatment with ZnSO 4 enhanced the stability of the basic sulfate salt and caused the basic sulfate salt to adsorb more strongly onto the catalyst surface. Above all, the catalyst gave the best performance for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene when the basic sulfate salt was dispersed over the Ru-Zn catalyst surface as a monolayer. This provides a clear path for the development of novel catalysts with good activity and excellent selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene and for other selective hydrogenations (such as the selective hy- drogenation of alkynes to alkenes).

Benzene conversion (a) and cyclohexene selectivity (b) on the catalysts pretreated with different Zn loadings. Zn loading of 7.7%, 8.6%, and 9.6% were pretreated and the results are shown in Fig. 4. After the pretreatment, the catalysts with a Zn loading of 8.6% exhibited moderate activity and the best cyclohexene selectivity. Moreover, cyclohexene selectiv- ity decreased slowly with an increase in benzene conversion. A cyclohexene selectivity of 69.8% and a benzene conversion of 84.4% were obtained for this catalyst. The activity of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 7.7% was higher than that of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 8.6% while the cyclohexene selectivity of the latter was much higher than that of the former. Although the initial selectivity of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 9.6% was higher than that of the catalyst with a Zn loading of 8.6%, the latter had a higher activity than the former. More- over, the cyclohexene selectivity of the latter decreased more slowly than that of the former with an increase in benzene conversion. This indicates that the monolayer dispersion cata- lyst had the best catalytic performance, which is in agreement with reference [12]. This also indicates that the role of the pretreatment is as follows: (1) After the pretreatment, hydrogen was preferentially adsorbed on the most active sites and ben- zene was only adsorbed on the moderately active sites. This benefited the activation of benzene and also the desorption of cyclohexene [16]; (2) The pretreatment resulted in the pas- sivation and structural stability of the catalyst, which pro- longed the life of the catalyst [17]; (3) The pretreatment shifted the pore distribution to larger pores, which promoted the de- sorption of cyclohexene and improved cyclohexene selectivity [17]. The pretreatment with ZnSO 4 enhanced the stability of the basic sulfate salt and caused the basic sulfate salt to adsorb more strongly onto the catalyst surface. Above all, the catalyst gave the best performance for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene when the basic sulfate salt was dispersed over the Ru-Zn catalyst surface as a monolayer. This provides a clear path for the development of novel catalysts with good activity and excellent selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene and for other selective hydrog CHNJC 60168 S1872-2067(10)60168-4 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60168-4 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Foundation item: Supported by Key Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education (202093). SHORT COMMUNICATION Monolayer Dispersed Ru-Zn Catalyst and Its Performance in the Selective Hydrogenation of Benzene to Cyclohexene Haijie SUN Xudong ZHANG Zhihao CHEN Xiaoli ZHOU Wei GUO Zhongyi LIU * Shouchang LIU Department of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-371-67783384; Fax: +86-371-67783384 A series of Ru-Zn catalysts with different Zn loadings were prepared by co-precipitation. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that a large part of the Zn in the Ru-Zn catalysts were present in the form of ZnO and the ZnO on the catalyst surface could react with ZnSO4 in the slurry to form a basic zinc sulfate salt during hydrogenation. The content of the basic salt increased with an increase in the Zn loading of the catalysts. This resulted in a decrease in catalyst activity and an increase in selectivity for cyclohexene. When the Zn loading was 8.6%, the basic salt dispersion was close to monolayer dispersion on the catalyst surface. When the catalysts were pretreated in the presence of 0.6 mol/L ZnSO4 solution at 140 °C and at 5 MPa H2, a cyclohexene selectivity of 69.8% and a benzene conversion of 84.4% was achieved after 20 min. 摘要 ：采用共沉淀法制备了一系列不同 Zn 负载量的 Ru-Zn 催化剂. XRD 和 XPS 结果表明, 催化剂中的 Zn 大部分以 ZnO 形式存在, 在加氢过程中催化剂表面的 ZnO 可以与浆液中的 Zn2+形成碱式硫酸锌盐. 随催化剂中 Zn 负载量的增加, 碱式硫酸锌盐的量也增加, 这导致催化剂活性降低和环己烯选择性升高. 当 Zn 负载量为 8.6% 时, 加氢后碱式硫酸锌盐在 Ru-Zn 催化剂表面上接近单层分散态. 单层分散型 Ru-Zn 催化剂催化性能最佳, 该催化剂在 140 °C, 5 MPa H2 下和 0.6 mol/L 硫酸锌溶液中预处理 22 h 后, 反应 20 min, 苯转化率 84.4% 时, 环己烯选择性为 69.8%.
