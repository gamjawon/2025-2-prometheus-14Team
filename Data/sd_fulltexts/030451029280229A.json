When the external ligand was absent, the epoxides with the opposite configuration were formed in lower Yo e.e. In the presence of the external ligand, the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the structure of the strap in the catalyst, while no such dependence was observed in the absence of imidazole. The iron complex of chiral p-xylylene-strapped porphyrin effectively catalyzed the asymmetric oxidation of sulfides by iodosobenzene in the presence of imidazole. Introduction Catalysis by metalloporphyrins is a subject of much interest in relation to some biochemical reactions as well as synthesis. We have reported a variety of interesting reactions catalyzed by aluminum porphyrins, such as asymmetric hydrogen transfer from optically active alcohols to ketone [ 1 ], photo-assisted carbon dioxide fixation to unsaturated esters [2, 3], and living and immortal polymerizations of vinyl and heterocyclic compounds [4]. We have also designed chiral porphyrins based on a new concept, and applied these metal complexes to asymmetric reactions. In this article, emphasis will be placed on our studies of the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins and sulfoxidation of sulfides catalyzed by the manganese or iron complex of a conceptually new chiral porphyrin. The chemistry of porphyrin and its analogue is of particular interest in relation to the specific action of the heme-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome P-450. The cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases carry out a variety of reactions, including hydroxylation of the unactivated hydrocarbon, stereo- and regiospecific epoxidation of double bonds, and oxygenation of heteroatoms [5]. It has also been noted that the above oxygenation reactions mediated by cytochrome P-450 take place enantioselectively under appropriate conditions [6-8]. Numerous chiral synthetic metalloporphyrin catalysts have been exploited [9-15], not only in order to construct a model system for these interesting asymmetric oxygenation processes, but also to help discover new synthetic routes. The active site of cytochrome P-450 is an iron porphyrin bound to a cysteine thiolate group of the chiral protein molecule [16, 17]. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia.

In the present article, we will describe a conceptually new chiral porphyrin catalyst derived from porphyrin with enantiotopic faces. Porphyrin carrying specifically arranged peripheral substituents has enantiotopic faces and is thus prochiral. For example, compound 1 has four systematically arranged substituents (R'-R4); the front and back views of this molecule are not superimposable but are mirror images (Formula 2).

We found that the `H NMR spectrum of the zinc complex of 2 carrying a chiral axial ligand such as 1.-methoxypropionate exhibited diastereomeric signals assigned to the axial ligand, demonstrating the potential utility of 2 as a new type of chiral shift reagent [ 18 ]. 4 and its metal complexes were found to undergo thermal- and/or photo-induced racemization, providing new evidence for the conformational ruffling of the porphyrin ring [ 19 ] . By using the antipodes of cobalt complexes of 2 and 3, a novel stereochemical approach to the mechanism of the reversible transfer of alkyl and aryl groups between cobalt and nitrogen can be made, which is related to the heme inactivation by hydrazine [20]. Asymmetric oxidation catalyzed by metal complexes of chiral strapped porphyrins (5) In relation to the asymmetric oxygenation reaction mediated by cytochrome P-450, a variety of chiral metalloporphyrins bearing chiral peripheral groups have been exploited that mimic the essential role of hemoprotein around the active site [9-13]. Here we provide a fundamentally new strategy for structurally modeling the active site of cytochrome P-450 in asymmetric oxidation of prochiral olefins and sulfides (Scheme 1). The porphyrin ligand of P-450 is protoporphyrin LX, which has enantiotopic faces, and thus has no inherent optical activity. However, upon coordination of the cysteine thiolate group, the protoheme group exhibits its own chirality, and exists as one of two possible optically active diastereoisomers as a result of a stereospecific discrimination between the faces of the heme by the chiral protein molecule (Fig. 1) [ 16, 17 ] .

The catalysts we exploited here are the chiral strapped porphyrin complexes (6), which have two chemically inequivalent, diastereotopic faces, and model the stereochemical structure of the P-450 active site. When an axially coordinating ligand is present on the non-strapped face, the oxygen-transfer reaction is expected to occur exclusively on the strapped face of the catalyst (Fig. 2).

For example, the zinc complex of p-xylylene-strapped porphyrin (5b) showed two peaks with comparable peak areas when chromatographed on silica gel coated with cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate). Fraction I provided a positive CD band in the Soret region, and fraction II a negative band. Thus these antipodes are denoted here as ( + )- and ( - )-5b, respectively. This was also the case for the antipodes of free base 5a ((+ )- and (- ) 5a) and those of manganese complex 5c ((+ )- and (-)-5c) and iron complex 5d ((+ )- and (-)-5d), derived respectively from the corresponding antipodes of 5b and 5a. In contrast to 5a, the antipodes of the free-base m-xylylene strapped porphyrin (m-XYSPH2, 6a) and dodecamethylene-strapped porphyrin (DMSPH2, 7a) could be directly resolved by HPLC with the same column pack and showed strong CD bands at the Soret regions (401 nm). Epoxidation of olefins Epoxidation of olefins [22] was carried out using the antipodes of the chloromanganese complexes 5c-7c as chiral catalysts and iodosobenzene as oxidant. As shown in Table 1, the epoxidation occurred with satisfactory enantioselectivities when the antipodes of p-xylylene-strapped catalyst (5c) TABLE 1 Asymmetric epoxidation of olefins by chiral manganese porphyrinsa Run Olefin Catalyst Base Yield b e.e.

For example, use of (+)-5c as a catalyst with 10 eq. of imidazole for the epoxidation of styrene resulted in the formation of optically active styrene oxide in 4396 yield (based on the initial amount of iodosobenzene) with the (R)-configuration in 49% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) (run 1). As expected, using the catalyst with the opposite configuration ((-)-5c), (S)-styrene oxide was preferentially formed (45ss'o yield) in a comparable enantiomeric excess (48ss'o e.e.) under the same conditions (run 2). Similarly, 4-chloro- and 4-methylstyrene, 2-vinylnaphthalene, indene, and 1,2-dihydronaphthalene were enantioselectively epoxidized in the presence of imidazole in 42 to 58ss'o e.e. with yields (based on the initial amount of iodosobenzene) ranging from 32 to 6590 (runs 5, 8-11). Substituted imidazoles such as 1-ethyl- and 2-methylimidazole behaved much like nonsubstituted imidazole in the asymmetric epoxidation (runs 4 and 6), while use of 2-phenylimidazole resulted in a remarkable decrease in enantioselectivity (run 7). When the chiral m-xylylene-strapped catalyst ((-)-6c) was used coupled with 1-ethylimidazole, (R)-styrene oxide was formed in 30ss'o e.e. (27% yield) under similar conditions (run 12). Use of the chiral catalyst bearing a dodecamethylene strap ((+)-7c) resulted in a significant decrease in enantiomeric excess of the epoxide (17ss'o e.e.; (R), 33% yield) along with the formation of a considerable amount of phenylacetaldehyde (run 14). Thus in the presence of imidazole, the enantioselectivity of the reaction varies with the structure of the strap in the catalyst. However, it should also be noted that (R)-epoxides were always formed predominantly when the catalyst was a (+)-antipode of 5c-7c (which shows positive CD bands in the Soret regions), while the formation of (S)-epoxides was favored when the catalysts with the opposite configuration ((-)-antipodes) were employed. . The asymmetric oxygen transfer achieved with the chiral manganese strapped porphyrin catalyst-imidazole systems is considered a result of the epoxidation predominantly occurring on the strapped face of the catalyst. In connection with this, when a CHZCIZ solution of 5c was spectroscopically titrated with imidazole, six isosbestic points were observed, and the spectral changes varied linearly with the concentration of imidazole to the first power (K=2.1 x 102 1 mol-1) [23, 241, indicating that only one imidazole molecule can coordinate to 5c. The molecular model study indicated that the coordination of imidazole to 5c is likely to occur specifically on the open face of 5c, since imidazole is too large to be incorporated into the strap cavity. In the presence of imidazole, the unstrapped face of the active site is probably blocked owing to the coordination with imidazole, denying access to olefins and/or iodosobenzene. Therefore, the enantioselectivity of the reaction in the presence of imidazole is affected by the structure of the strap in the catalyst (runs 4, 12, and 14), but it is not affected in the absence of imidazole (runs 3, 13, and 15). In sharp contrast, when styrene was epoxidized by iodosobenzene in the absence of imidazole using 5c as catalyst (run 3), the configuration of the epoxide obtained was the opposite of that formed in the presence of 127 imidazole (run 1). The same was true for the reactions using 6c and 7c as catalysts (runs 12 and 14, runs 13 and 15). Furthermore, the observed % e.e. of the products were all low, in the range 16-18ss'o, indicating that the strap part of the catalyst does not affect the enantioselectivity of the reaction. In the absence of imidazole, the reaction on the unstrapped open face of the catalyst is allowed, which preferentially affords the epoxides with the opposite configurations. Taking into account the inversion of the stereochemistry of reaction and the decrease in % e.e. of the products (runs 3, 13, and 15), the epoxidation in the absence of imidazole is considered to occur predominantly on the sterically less-hindered, unstrapped face of the catalyst, with a low steric requirement. Sutfoxidation of sulfides Asymmetric oxidation of prochiral aryl sulfides [251 by iodosobenzene was examined in the presence of imidazole, where the chloroiron complex of p-xylylene-strapped porphyrin (5d) was found to be an effective catalyst (Table 2). For example, in the oxidation of thioanisole by (+)-5d coupled with 600 eq. of imidazole, (S)-methyl phenyl sulfoxide was obtained in 71% yield (based on the initial amount of iodosobenzene) with an enantiomeric excess of 43% (run 2). Asymmetric sulfoxidation of other aryl sulfides, such as p-methyl- and p-bromo-thioanisoles and methoxymethyl phenyl sulfide, also took place in the presence of imidazole (runs 4, 6, and 12-14), where the highest enantioselectivity (up to 71% e.e.) was obtained in the case of methoxymethyl phenyl sulfide (runs 12-14). On the other hand, in the absence of imidazole, the enantioselectivity of the reaction virtually disappeared, giving racemic sulfoxides, indicating the essential role of imidazole in asymmetric induction (runs 1, 5, and 11). Five isosbestic points observed in the spectroscopic titration studies demonstrated that 5d undergoes one-to-one complexation with imidazole (K= 4.3 X 102 1 mol -'). Therefore, in the presence of imidazole, the reaction occurs predominantly on the strapped face owing to the possible blocking of the open face by the coordinating imidazole, while in the absence of imidazole, the reaction is considered to occur on the open face because of the low steric requirement. In sharp contrast, the asymmetric sulfoxidation also occurred even in the absence of imidazole, when a substrate with an amide group with hydrogen-bonding capability (run 9) or an electron-poor aromatic group (run 7) was used. Conclusion In the present paper, the conceptually new chiral metalloporphyrin catalysts (5c, 5d, 6c, and 7c) that mediate the asymmetric oxygen-transfer reaction are presented. The catalysts were derived from a porphyrin with enantiotopic faces by introducing a strap on one side, and have diastereotopic faces (Fig. 2) analogous to the chirally oriented protoheme (protoporphyrin IX) in the active center of cytochrome P-450 (Fig. 1).

When the external ligand was absent, the epoxides with the opposite configuration were formed in lower % e.e. In the presence of the external ligand, the enantioselectivity of the reaction depended on the structure of the strap in the catalyst, while no such dependence was observed in the absence of imidazole. The iron complex of chiralp-xylylene-strapped porphyrin effectively catalysed the asymmetric oxidation of sulfides by iodosobenzene in the presence of imidazole. References 1 Konishi K. Aida T.
