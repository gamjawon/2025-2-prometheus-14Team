Graphical abstract Herein we describe the syntheses of a series of ammonium, phosphonium, imidazolium and diazabycicloundecenium tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids, their full spectroscopic characterisation (FT-IR, 1H-, 13C-and 183W-NMR) and a comparison of their properties and possible applications in catalysis. The synthetic procedures to obtain the ionic liquids rely on anion exchange and acid-base reactions – including an innovative route for the synthesis of tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids using, for the first time, a halide-free organic ionic liquid as precursor. The tungstate ionic liquids were used as catalysts for CO2 fixation in styrene oxide as well as in a series of other epoxides to yield the corresponding carbonates. Under optimized conditions, styrene carbonate is obtained in up to 67 % yield at 90 °C with just butylmethylimidazolium tungstate, and in 91 % yield by coupling tetrabutylammonium tungstate and bromide. Preliminary tests indicate that the same catalysts can also promote epoxidation reactions, paving the way for their use in the direct oxidative carboxylation of olefins. Keywords Tungsten Ionic liquids in catalysis Epoxide CO2cyclic organic carbonate Introduction Emissions of CO2 represent a widespread concern for industrialized, emerging, and developing countries. At an average growth rate of 2.6 %/y (2000–2014) and with a yearly production of ca 35 gigatons, [1] anthropogenic CO2 is among the major causes of global warming with temperature predicted to increase up to 2 °C by 2100 (relatively to the pre-industrial level) [2]. While chemical conversion of captured CO2 will hardly account for more than 1% of the mitigation challenge [3]. Nonetheless CO2 is a chemically attractive, abundant, renewable and non-poisonous C1 feedstock useful for the synthesis of various classes of compounds, such as carboxylic acids and derivatives, alcohols and organic carbonates [4]. The challenges facing CO2 conversion are its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertia. The former implies a large energy input that could generate more carbon dioxide than is consumed, while the latter requires the presence of catalysts able to activate CO2 [5]. Common routes to activate CO2 involve the use of Lewis bases such as superbases or amine-containing species, [6] N-heterocyclic carbenes, [7] or by the formation of a transition metal−CO2 complex [8]. Activated CO2 is then reacted with starting materials such as unsaturated compounds (e.g. alkenes or alkynes), three membered rings (e.g. epoxides and aziridines) or organometallics to yield more thermodynamically-stable oxygenated products [9]. In this field, a continuous effort has been done in the last years to identify bifunctional catalysts capable of simultaneously activating CO2 and the substrate [5,10]. A remarkable case is represented by catalytic systems designed for the insertion of CO2 into epoxides (Fig. 1 ). The accepted mechanism for the reaction involves a Lewis- or Brønsted acid (A+) that activates the epoxide and a strong nucleophile (Nu−) which plays a double role by first favouring the ring opening and then acting as a leaving group in the final step where the cyclic organic carbonate forms and the catalyst is restored. Usually A+ is a tetra-alkylammonium or metal-based Lewis acid (e.g. Fe, Cr, Co, Al, Sn) [11] or a species with H-bonding ability (e.g. −OH, −COOH, -NH group) [12], while Nu− is a halide (especially bromide or iodide). Comprehensive recent reviews on the subject have further confirmed that the use of bifunctional metal- and organo-catalysts for the reaction requires a co-catalyst or a halide salt to induce the epoxide ring-opening [10,13]. In addition, very few articles have exploited halide-free processes [14]. Among metal-based catalysts, Kimura et al. have shown that monomeric tungstate salts as tetrabutylammonium tungstate ([N4,4,4,4]2[WO4], were active systems for the chemical fixation of CO2 into different compounds such as aryldiamines, primary monoamines, propargylic alcohols or 2-aminobenzonitriles. The comparably higher basicity, nucleophilicity, and H-bonding character of [WO4]2− with respect to polyoxotungstates, was accounted for the concurrent activation of CO2 and reactant substrates [15]. Subsequently, Guo et al. also proved that silver tungstate acted as a bifunctional catalyst for the carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2 under ambient conditions, in the presence of a stochiometric amount of a base and of butyl iodide [16]. Although interactions between the tungstate anion and CO2 were known since 1985, [17] these works were the first examples of catalytic exploitation of the tungstate-carbon dioxide adduct for CO2 fixation. In the field of CO2 insertion into epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic organic carbonates, there is evidence in the literature for the use of complex catalytic systems based on W such as zinc-substituted sandwich type polyoxotungstates, [18] Keggin-type zinc polioxotungstate metal organic frameworks, [19] tetracarbonyl manganese selenotungstate derivatives [20]. Surprisingly however, simple monotungstate-based catalysts have not been reported so far for this reaction. We here report for the first time the synthesis of ammonium and phosphonium tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids and their use as bifunctional catalysts for CO2 insertion in epoxides. The focal point of this work is the non-trivial synthesis of a series of tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids catalysts (TILCs) and their use for the cycloaddition of CO2 with different epoxides. The choice of the anions was functional for the development of new tandem chemistry where the tungstate moiety is expected to behave as a catalyst both for olefin epoxidation as well as for CO2 insertion. Experimental All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Trioctylmethyl ammonium methylcarbonate ([N8,8,8,1]CH3OCOO), trioctylmethylammonium acetate ([N8,8,8,1]CH3COO) and trioctylmethylammonium levulinate ([N8,8,8,1]Lev) were synthesized based on a procedure previously reported by us [21]. Synthesis of TILCs Synthesis of tungstate ionic liquids by metathesis Tetrabutylammonium tungstate ([N4,4,4,4]2[WO4], 1), butylmethylimidazolium tungstate (BMIM2[WO4], 2), tetrabutylphosphonium tungstate ([P4,4,4,4]2[WO4], 3), diazabicycloundecenonium tungstate (DBUH2[WO4], 4) were synthesized by adapting reported procedures [22]. Representative procedure: an aqueous solution of 26 mmol [N4,4,4,4]Br was added to Ag2WO4 (13 mmol). The color of the mixture darkened immediately indicative of ion exchange and the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 10 min. AgBr was filtered under suction, washed three times with deionized water and the aqueous solution obtained was concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 °C, 40 mbar) and dried under reduced pressure (50 °C, 0.1 mbar) yielding off-white crystalline solids ([N4,4,4,4]2WO4 =8.55 g, 10.4 mmol, yield = 80 %; BMIm2WO4 = 6.88 g, 11.18 mmol, yield = 86 %; [N4,4,4,4]2WO4 = 9.10 g, 11.96 mol, yield = 92 %, (DBUH)2WO4 = 6.27 g, 11.31 mol, yield = 87 %). Contamination of the product by bromide ions was excluded by testing for halides. The TILCs were characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 183W-NMR and identified by comparison with spectral data from the literature when possible. Synthesis of diazobycicloundecenium tungstate [(DBUH)2WO4] by acid-base reaction (DBUH)2WO4 was synthesized also by a simple acid-base reaction through the following procedure: tungstic acid (0.51 g, 2.06 mmol) was suspended in 10 ml of milli-Q H2O, stirring was started and then 0.63 g (4.12 mmol) of DBU were added dropwise, the solution turned from yellow to white in few minutes. The mixture was stirred for 1 h, then it was concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 °C, 40 mbar) and dried under reduced pressure (50 °C, 0.1 mbar) yielding a white solid (1.14 g, yield >99 %). (DBUH)2WO4 was characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 183W-NMR. Synthesis of trioctylmethylammonium tungstate ([N8,8,8,1]2[WO4]) via the methylcarbonate precursor H2WO4 (0.28 g, 1.1 mmol) was slowly added to an aqueous solution of [N8,8,8,1][CH3OCOO] (0.83 g, 1.86 mmol) heated at 50 °C. The solution was stirred for 3 h during which time the initial opalescent solution turned yellow. The solution was cooled, and ethyl acetate was added to extract [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4]. The product ionic liquid (0.78 g, 0.79 mmol, yield = 86 %) was characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 183W-NMR. Synthesis of trioctylmethylammonium peroxotungstate ([N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4]2−) via the methylcarbonate precursor H2WO4 (0.72 g, 2.89 mmol) was dissolved in hydrogen peroxide (30 % v/vH2O, 1.5 ml, 43.35 mmol) and the solution was heated at 50 °C and stirred until the solution turned from yellow to white opalescent. The mixture was filtered and then a 10 ml aqueous solution of [N8,8,8,1]CH3OCOO (2.56 g, 5.78 mmol) was added. The solution turned immediately from white to yellow again, it was heated at 50 °C and an evident evolution of CO2 suggested the formation of the desired product. The solution was stirred for 1 h, then ethyl acetate was added to extract [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4]2−. The ionic liquid obtained after rotary evaporation (2.49 g, 1.94 mmol, yield = 67 %) was characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 183W-NMR. Typical procedure for CO2 fixation reaction (CO2 pressure = 10−50 bar) The selected epoxide (4 mmol, 1 eq), tungstate catalyst (0.03 eq), mesitylene as internal standard (10 % w/w substrate) and – where applicable – the co-catalyst (0.03 eq), were charged in a flat-bottomed glass reactor liner which was placed inside a 100-ml stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, degassed via two vacuum−CO2 cycles and pressurized with CO2 (10−50 bar). The autoclave was then electrically heated at the desired temperature (50−130 °C) and the reaction was magnetically stirred for the desired time (5−48 h). At the end of each run, the autoclave was rapidly cooled in an ice bath and vented, and the final mixture was analysed by 1H-NMR to calculate conversion, yield and selectivity. Typical procedure for the CO2 cycloaddition reaction (CO2 pressure = 1 bar) The selected epoxide (4 mmol, 1 eq), tungstate catalyst (0.03 eq) and mesitylene as internal standard (10 % w/w substrate) were charged into a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The flask was degassed via two vacuum−CO2 cycles and a rubber reservoir containing about 2 litres of CO2 was connected to the flask. The reaction vessel was sealed to prevent losses of substrates and/or CO2 and stirred at 90 °C for 18 h. After the chosen time, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was analysed by 1H-NMR to determine substrate conversion, selectivity and yield. Results and discussion Tungstate ionic liquids catalysts (TILCs) synthesis A series of onium (ammonium, phosphonium, imidazolium and diazabycicloundecenium) tungstate ionic liquids, Q2[WO4], were initially prepared to start investigating the insertion of CO2 into epoxides. Three different synthetic procedures were implemented. The first protocol (Fig. 2 ) was adapted from the literature [22] and involved metathesis between silver tungstate (Ag2WO4) and different onium bromide salts, Q+Br− in water, yielding the corresponding water-soluble tungstate ionic liquids and the insoluble silver halide. After filtration and removal of water under vacuum, the desired tungstate salts: [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] (1, N4,4,4,4 = tetrabutylammonium, 80 % yield), [BMIm]2[WO4] (2, BMIm = n-butylmethylimidazolium, 86 % yield), [P4,4,4,4]2[WO4] (3, P4,4,4,4 = tetrabutylphosphonium, 92 % yield), and DBUH2[WO4] (4, DBUH = diazabycicloundecenium, 87 % yield) were obtained as off-white hygroscopic solids [23]. The method proved to be a general synthetic benchmark, but it suffered from the use of silver salts with concurrent formation of silver halides as by-products. Other procedures focused on more economic, sustainable, greener and halide-free routes, were then considered. The second protocol (Fig. 3 ) involved a direct acid-base reaction between diazabicycloundecene (DBU) as a strong organic base, and tungstic acid, H2WO4. DBU-based metal ionic liquids are proved to be efficient for the CO2 fixation into epoxides [16,24]. The dropwise addition of DBU to an aqueous suspension of tungstic acid [25] led in few minutes to the formation of a colorless clear solution with concurrent change of the pH from acid to neutral. Water was removed by evaporation under vacuum (50 °C, 0.1 mbar) yielding diazabicycloundecenium tungstate (DBUH2[WO4], 4) in >99 % yield. Attempts to perform the same reaction with methylimidazole (MIm) and trioctylamine (N888) were however unsuccessful. This was attributed to the relatively lower basicity of these substrates compared to DBU (MImH and N8,8,8H pKa = 6.95 and 10.75 respectively, compared to pKa = 13.5 of DBUH in water) [26]. With a view of establishing a general synthetic method that avoids silver precursors and halide salts, we investigated a third methodology based on an acid-base reaction between tungstic acid (H2WO4) and trioctylmethylammonium methylcarbonate {N8,8,8,1[CH3OCOO]; N8,8,8,1= (C8H17)3N+CH3}. We have previously described the synthesis of N8,8,8,1[CH3OCOO] from trioctylamine (N8,8,8) and dimethylcarbonate (CH3OCOOCH3), followed by anion exchange with a Brønsted acid HA (Fig. 4 ) to yield irreversibly a wide range of ammonium salts of general structure N8,8,8,1[A]. This was a simple and clean protocol free of any work-up step, whose driving force was the formation of methylcarbonic acid (i.e. the half ester of carbonic acid) that spontaneously decomposed to methanol and CO2 above −36 °C [21]. A similar procedure was here used to synthesize tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids. As shown in Fig. 5 a, tungstic acid in slight stochiometric excess was slowly added to an aqueous solution of N8,8,8,1[CH3OCOO] at 70 °C, the solution was then stirred for 1.5 h during which time the pH went from 10 to 7. The product [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4] (5) was obtained as a colorless ionic liquid in 86 % yield after extraction with ethyl acetate. The same methodology, with addition of hydrogen peroxide, was used to synthesize the analogous peroxotungstate ionic liquid 6 (Fig. 5b). The latter belongs to the class of peroxotungstates which are known as catalytic and stoichiometric oxidants, [27] but also proposed in one instance as catalytic intermediates formed during the insertion reaction of CO2 to yield styrene carbonate from styrene via the bromohydrin [28]. According to the literature, different peroxotungstate species exist in an aqueous solution depending on pH: at pH > 9, three anions, [W(O2)4]2−, [WO2(O2)2]2−and [WO3(O2)]2−, form and their distribution depends on the H2O2/W ratio; at 1.3 < pH < 9, the dimer [W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2]2− (Fig. 6 ) is the major species; and at pH < 1.3 in the presence of HCl, cis-[WO(O2)Cl4]2− is present [27a,29]. In our case, the initial yellow acidic solution (pH ≈ 1.5–2) of H2WO4 and H2O2 slowly turned to colorless while the pH became neutral (pH ≈ 6–7). Upon complete dissolution of tungstic acid, the dimeric [W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2]2− peroxotungstate was likely the most abundant anion (Fig. 6) [30]. To this dimer was slowly added an aqueous solution of N8,8,8,1[CH3OCOO] causing immediate evolution of CO2 and methanol and a pH increase to ≈ 9. The solution was stirred for additional 2 h and then extracted with ethyl acetate to afford, after solvent evaporation, a viscous oily compound whose characterization data were consistent with the ionic liquid [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2]2− (6) (spectroscopic data are discussed in the following section). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first successful halide-free route for the synthesis of a peroxotungstate ionic liquid using a completely organic ionic liquid as a precursor [27,31]. Tungstate ionic liquid catalysts characterization The structures of the tungstate ionic liquids were confirmed by FT-IR, 1H-, 13C-and 183W-NMR [32]. The FT-IR spectra of silver tungstate and of the TILCs 1–6 are in the SI section (Figures S1-S7). All the TILCs showed the characteristic bands associated to the cations while the presence of oxotungstate species was confirmed by the large adsorption associated to the WO stretching vibration observed between 843 and 829 cm−1, by the WOW adsorption at 751 cm-1 and by the WOO adsorption at 544 cm−1 for 6 (Figure S7) [30,33]. Comparison of the 1H-NMR spectra of [BMIm]2[WO4] and of its precursor BMIm[Br] highlighted differences in the chemical shifts of the three imidazolium protons H2, H4, H5, indicative of different hydrogen-bonding ability [34]. As summarized in Table 1 ,[BMIm]2[WO4] showed a 0.1 ppm upfield shift for H4 and H5 and a 0.2 ppm shift for H2 with respect to the analogue BMIm[Br] protons. Moreover, as can be seen in Figure S9 (see SI section) the H2 resonance in BMIm2[WO4] integrated less than unity, indicating that this proton was largely engaged in H-bonding with WO4 2−, in line with the higher basicity of this anion compared to bromide anion [35]. The lower chemical shifts for the three [BMIm]2[WO4] protons further corroborated stronger H-bonding between cation and anion for [BMIm]2[WO4] with respect to BMImBr [35–37]. A slight upfield shift was shown also in the spectra of DBUH2[WO4] respect to DBU (see fig. S10 and S11 in SI) ascribed to the higher negative charge of [WO4]2− respect to the bromide anion. As expected, the 1H-NMR spectra of [P4,4,4,4]2[WO4] and of [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] were not significantly different from those of the precursors [P4,4,4,4]Br and [N4,4,4,4]Br (fig. S12-S15 in SI), consistent with the weaker interactions between the ammonium and phosphonium cations with the tungstate anion. Likewise, no significant differences between the 1H-NMR spectra of [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4] and [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4]2- and that of trioctylmethylammonium methylcarbonate were observed, although the peaks relative to the methylene and methyl groups close to the nitrogen atom showed slight upfield shifts. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4] and [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4]2- also confirmed the disappearance of the peaks relative to the methyl carbonate anion (see fig. S18-S21 in SI). Finally, the 183W-NMR spectra of the TILCs 1-5 proved the presence of monomeric tungstate [WO4]2− since one single resonance in the range +10 – -24 ppm (relative to the Na2WO4 reference) was observed excluding polyoxotungstate species [38]. Additionally, the interactions between the onium cations and tungstate anion lead to different chemical shifts respect to the sodium tungstate reference. (Figures S22-S27 of the SI). A different behavior was observed for the peroxotungstate ionic liquid 6 which showed a single signal at -612 ppm. This was assigned to the dimeric anion [W2O3(O2)4(H2O)2]2− consistent with the fact that this species was expected as the prevailing one at pH < 9 and H2O2/W > 1 (see above). Indeed, given the presence of H2O2, a previous study reported that the tungsten resonance of Na2[W2O3(O2)4]2− was at -699 ppm [30]. The same investigation also excluded peroxotungstate species [W(O2)4]2− expected to fall at ≈ -1250 ppm. Catalytic fixation of CO2 in epoxides catalyzed by the TILCs Initially, [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] was chosen as the model catalyst to study the CO2 fixation reaction into styrene oxide 7 to yield styrene carbonate 8 (eq 1). Table 2 reports the results obtained by screening a set of different temperatures (50, 90 and 130 °C), CO2 pressures (1, 10 and 50 bar) and the use of three solvents (acetonitrile, diethylene glycol and toluene). Reactions run using styrene oxide 7 as solvent/reagent (entries 1–5), showed that the highest conversion (88 %) and selectivity (65 %) were reached at 90 °C and 50 bar of CO2, respectively (entry 4). If the temperature was decreased to 50 °C, conversion did not exceed 11 % (entry 1), while at 130 °C (entry 5) the reaction was quantitative, but selectivity towards the desired product 8 dropped to 23 %. Also, a remarkable effect of the pressure on the product distribution was observed. At 90 °C, increasing P from 1 to 10 and 50 bar progressively improved the selectivity towards 8 from 0 to 54 % and to 65 %, respectively (entries 2, 3, 4). It should be noted that the conversion of 7 was quantitative even under 1 bar of CO2, yet the formation of different epoxide derivatives [39,40] instead of 8, was observed under such conditions. A considerably higher pressure of CO2 was required to steer the reaction towards the desired cyclic carbonate in the presence of the tungstate-based onium salt. Finally, the effect of an added solvent was investigated by testing the reaction in acetonitrile, diethylene glycol and toluene as representative aprotic polar, protic polar and non-polar solvents, respectively. Acetonitrile and diethylene glycol slightly enhanced conversion (90 and 92 %, respectively) and selectivity (73 % in both cases) towards 8 (entries 7 and 8) while with toluene selectivity dropped to zero in favor of isomers, dimers or hydrolyzed derivatives of 7 (entry 9). Next, the catalytic activity of the other five different TILCs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, was tested on the model CO2 fixation reaction under the optimized operative conditions (90 °C, 50 bar CO2, 18 h). Results are summarized in Table 3 . The reaction conversion showed a fluctuating trend consistent with a strong influence of the cation: it was comparable for [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4], [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4] and [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4] with [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] slightly outperforming the others (82–88 %: entries 1, 2, and 3). The conversion decreased with [P4,4,4,4]2[WO4] and DBUH2[WO4] (57–60 %: entries 4 and 5) and finally, it was significantly improved up to a substantially quantitative value (98 %) in the presence of [BMIm]2[WO4] (entry 6). The selectivity towards carbonate 8 instead, remained relatively constant (60–68 %) in all cases, suggesting that the tungstate anion favored CO2 fixation albeit still causing concurrent side-reactions, particularly the isomerization of 7 to acetophenone and phenylacetaldehyde (according to GC–MS analysis). For comparison, Table 3 also reports the results with N4,4,4,4Br as a catalyst (entry 7). Although the bromide salt apparently prompted the highest selectivity for CO2 cycloaddition (82 %), the yield of the carbonate 8 (72 %) was comparable to that achieved with the tungstate-based imidazolium salt (67 %, entry 6). The established mechanism for CO2 insertion in epoxides catalyzed by ammonium halides (Fig. 1) involves oxirane activation by the ammonium cation [41] while the halide acts first as a nucleophile that opens the epoxide (the rate-determining step) and then as a leaving group that drives cyclization. Recent investigations, however, have confirmed that the catalytic activity is affected by the strength of the interactions between the cation and anion of the catalyst, the presence of H-bonding between them, but also by the pKa of any available hydrogen bond-donor in the cation [12,42]. For example, it is known that imidazolium ionic liquids activate the oxirane ring by H-bonding. This effect may explain the increased conversion achieved with [BMIm]2[WO4] (Table 3, entry 6) respect to the other TILCs. Conversely, the pKa and the steric hindrance of DBUH were critical factors that could negatively influence the catalytic efficiency of DBUH2[WO4] (Table 3, entry 5) [13b]. Compared to tetrabutylammonium tungstate [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4], the phosphonium analogue ([P4,4,4,4]2[WO4] (entry 4) maintained selectivity in the same range, but conversion did not exceed 57 % under the same conditions. This observation is opposite to a recent study by Steinbauer et al. relative to the use of monofunctional and hydroxyl-functionalized ammonium and phosphonium halides for the CO2 fixation into epoxides: under operative conditions similar to the ones used by us (solventless, 90 °C, 6 h, 10 bar CO2, 2%mol catalyst) monofunctional tetrabutylphosphonium salts showed a higher activity compared to that of corresponding ammonium analogs [43]. The reversed trend of Table 3 was likely due to the different coulombic interactions between cation and tungstate that modulated the chemical, physical and catalytic properties of the TILCs [44]. With the optimized conditions in hand and to broaden the scope of the coupling reaction, various linear and cyclic aliphatic compounds were examined for the formation of the corresponding cyclic carbonate by using the best catalyst, [BMIm]2WO4 (Fig. 7 ). The results show that monosubstituted terminal epoxides such as butyl glycidyl ether (9) and hexene oxide (10) were converted into the corresponding cyclic carbonate with conversion and selectivity similar to the one reported for styrene oxide. Evidently electron-rich substrates such as 7 and 9 are more easily activated towards CO2 fixation respect to 10. Under the same conditions, even the less reactive cyclohexene oxide (11) is easily converted but the selectivity towards the carbonate declined presumably because of the steric hindrance caused by its ring structure. Finally, the challenging coupling of CO2 with the bulky cyclic trisubstituted limonene oxide (12) showed, as expected, lower conversion and selectivity, albeit still allowing to achieve a 14 % yield. According to established reports, 183W-NMR and single crystal X-Ray diffraction on tetrahedral [WO4]2− and [MoO4]2− show that CO2 coordinates to one of the oxygen atoms and not to the metal, forming carbonate complexes of formula [MO3(CO3)]2-. The latter species can react with diamines, aminonitriles, propargylic alcohols and terminal alkynes for CO2 fixation, or with triethylsilane for CO2 reduction [15a,16,45]. These observations led us to propose the mechanism described in Fig. 8 for the CO2 fixation into epoxides catalyzed by TILCs. The carbonate complex I formed in situ in the presence of CO2 could act itself directly as the nucleophile and attack the cation-activated epoxide, yielding an intermediate II that was ready for ring-closure to give the organic carbonate and the starting tungstate. This mechanism was coherent with the fact that CO2 cycloaddition did not take place at 50 °C (entry 1, Table 2) while, above 70 °C, complex I was able to release activated CO2, as already reported for [MoO3(CO3)]2− [45]. While most of the metal-based catalytic systems for the fixation of CO2 into epoxides require the presence of a halide (Cl−, Br−, I−) or of a nucleophile as co-catalyst to achieve any conversion [10–13], the present mechanism is able to account for the absence of a halide or of other external nucleophiles (Fig. 1). In addition, the mechanism is supported by the evidence of CO2-tungstate complex formation described above, as well as by a comparison with other mechanisms reported for the synthesis of polycarbonates mediated by metal complexes containing an alkoxide or an aryloxyde group (-OR) that are able to undergo CO2 insertion into epoxides without the need of an external nucleophile [46]. To verify whether the tungstate moiety could act in synergy with a halide, in analogy to other transition metals explored for CO2 fixation, we then explored the combined use of a halide ammonium salt, i.e. N4,4,4,4Br, along with our tungstate-based catalysts for the insertion reaction. Preliminary tests led us to lower the temperature and extend the reaction time (50 °C, 48 h) respect to the reaction conducted in presence of the sole TILCs (90 °C, 18 h). This choice was also in agreement with published protocols [13c,47], in particular with a recent study where polyoxotungstate/zinc metal organic frameworks along with N4,4,4,4Br were utilized successfully at 50 °C [19]. As summarized in Table 4 , at 50 °C the model reaction 7 → 8 in the presence of either N4,4,4,4Br or [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] separately, proceeded with low conversion (entries 1 and 2: 53 % and 11 % conversion, respectively) and with low selectivity (87 % and 45 %, respectively). However, the combination of N4,4,4,4Br and [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4] (entry 3) led to an excellent conversion as high as 91 % and complete selectivity towards the formation of 8. The presence of bromide anions sourced by N4,4,4,4Br clearly had a dramatic effect to favor the CO2 cycloaddition with respect to competitive reaction pathways. A similar behavior was noticed also for the [N8,8,8,1]2[WO4]/N4,4,4,4Br mixture by which 100 % selectivity was achieved at 89 % conversion (entry 4). Other combinations such as [N8,8,8,1]2[W2O3(O2)4]2−/N4,4,4,4Br, [P4,4,4,4]2[WO4]/N4,4,4,4Br, and DBUH2[WO4]/N4,4,4,4Br, offered poorer results since both the conversion and the selectivity dropped (entries 5, 6, and 7), the latter (selectivity) due to the formation of isomerization by-products. Finally, [BMIm]2[WO4]/[N4,4,4,4]Br (entry 8) showed 100 % selectivity albeit a lower conversion (76 %) compared to [N4,4,4,4]2[WO4]/[N4,4,4,4]Br. In agreement with data of Table 3 confirming that the imidazolium cation is beneficial for the formation of cyclic carbonates. This lower conversion could be explained with the known interactions of the imidazolium moiety with bromide that lead to a reduction of its nucleophilicity and ring-opening ability, as recently reported in the literature [42]. Since the presence of halides is generally considered undesirable from a green chemistry standpoint, our final attempts were finalized at substituting [N4,4,4,4]Br with ionic liquids having a non-halide anion able to act as nucleophile-leaving group. The tested anions included two species already shown to act as catalysts for CO2 fixation into epoxides by us: methylcarbonate (CH3OCOO−), acetate (CH3COO−) [14a]; as well as levulinate (Lev: CH3(CO)CH2CH2CH2COO−) and hydroxide that were recently reported as catalyst or co-catalyst for CO2 fixation [48,49]. The results however, were not as rewarding as expected (Table S1, ESI section). Conversions remained low (19–35 %) since at this temperature the organic anions are not as good as nucleophiles. On the contrary, selectivity was generally good (70–80%) although it was not possible to prevent the formation of by-products. In the case of N4,4,4,4OH, results were somewhat reversed: the conversion was slightly higher (48 %), but the selectivity dropped to 50 %. Conclusions A set of new tungstate ionic liquids (TILCs) were synthesized. A novel halide-free synthetic route was also developed, that provided access to both tungstate and peroxotungstate new ionic liquids. These new compounds proved viable catalysts for CO2 fixation into epoxides: in particular, butylmethylimidazolium tungstate BMIm2[WO4] promoted conversion of styrene oxide to the corresponding cyclic carbonate in 67 % yield with 50 bar CO2 at 90 °C. To account for these results, a reaction mechanism based on the formation of tungstate-carbonate as the active nucleophile was proposed. Although the investigated TILCs were less efficient than other metal-based catalysts coupled with nucleophile sources, TILCs exhibit a surprisingly higher catalytic activity respect to other metals when used alone. Also, in our case a cooperative effect was demonstrated by which using a binary mixture of a tungstate IL and a bromide IL, both conversion and selectivity towards the formation of the cyclic carbonate were boosted to substantially quantitative values. To the best of our knowledge, this paper describes the first example in which simple TILCs are successfully used for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. Considering the well-known oxidation activity of tungstate-based catalysts [27b,50], some preliminary tests were carried out to evaluate the oxidation activity of our TILCs. Unfortunately, the epoxidation of styrene to 7 in presence of hydrogen peroxide (1.5 eq.) at 45 °C for 30 min give unsatisfactory results, since the excessive oxidative activity of TILCs led to the prevailing formation of benzaldehyde. On the other hand, the same reaction conducted with a model substrate for epoxidation such as cyclooctene led to an almost quantitative conversion (96 %) and an exciting 85 % selectivity towards cyclooctene oxide. The possibility to refine the reaction operative conditions to get a tandem or one-pot olefin epoxidation−CO2 fixation processes is currently under investigation in our lab Declaration of Competing Interest There are no conflicts to declare.

The synthetic procedures to obtain the ionic liquids rely on anion exchange and acid-base reactions – including an innovative route for the synthesis of tungstate and peroxotungstate ionic liquids using, for the first time, a halide-free organic ionic liquid as precursor. The tungstate ionic liquids were used as catalysts for CO2 fixation in styrene oxide as well as in a series of other epoxides to yield the corresponding carbonates. Under optimized conditions, styrene carbonate is obtained in up to 67 % yield at 90 °C with just butylmethylimidazolium tungstate, and in 91 % yield by coupling tetrabutylammonium tungstate and bromide. Preliminary tests indicate that the same catalysts can also promote epoxidation reactions, paving the way for their use in the direct oxidative carboxylation of olefins.",
