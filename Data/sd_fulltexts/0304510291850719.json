Andreini Institute of Chemical Technology, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (The Netherlands) Introduction Re-oxide-alumina is one of the most promising catalysts known today for the low (room) temperature metathesis of a variety of substrates. Its catalytic activity reaches a maximum at a loading of about 13 wt.%: at this loading it can cause the metathesis of non-functionalized olefins and, when promoted, of functionalized olefins. The work of Kawai et al. [1] has shown that the catalyst selectivity can be improved to near 100% by using cesium nitrate as an additive. The stability of this catalyst, in its standard composition and after modification with phosphate, has recently been the subject of extensive studies [2, 3]. The phosphate modification is known to improve the level of catalytic activity [4-6]. In comparison, the Re-oxide-silica alumina catalyst shows the advantage of high activity at low loading, a most interesting aspect. One disadvantage of this catalyst is the lack of selectivity [7]: attempts to improve it and bring it close to 100% were only partially successful. Another disadvantage is the lower stability [2, 8]. The purpose of this article is to review the literature covering such subjects as the adsorption of precursor species and the elimination of the surface hydroxyls of the support, the role of surface aluminium ions, the catalysts models, the modification of the support in relationship to the enhancement of the catalytic activity for metathesis, the role of acidity, and all pertinent information as available from spectroscopic studies and activity measurements. On this basis it is possible to place a great variety of experiments in a fitting conceptual frame. The emerging clearer vision of the genesis of the precursor structures (several are proposed) allows the discussion of possible and observed support effects, and the explanation for the lack of activity of low loading Re-oxide-alumina catalysts. 0304-5102/91/S3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 360 Deposition of precursor species. Elimination of surface OH groups The adsorption of ammonium perrhenate on alumina bears similarity to the adsorption of other precursor species in several relevant aspects. This is best illustrated in the comparative study of Mulcahy et al. [9] involving ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium chromate, ammonium metatungstate, potassium permanganate and ammonium perrhenate. While the adsorption of perrhenate and permanganate could well be explained on the basis of the often-proposed electrostatic model, according to Brunelle [ 10 ], considering as primary factors the charge of the ion, the pH of the impregnating solution and the isoelectric point of the support (IEP), the deposition ofheptamolybdate and metatungstate species, insensitive to the presence of a foreign ion (nitrate), would require a different mechanism, possibly featuring first an electrostatic ion pairing step, followed by a condensation reaction: Al-OH2++Mo70246-=Al-OH2+Mo70246-=Al-0-Mo70235-+H20 (1) (chromate adsorption appears to be an intermediate case). A mechanism featuring primarily electrostatic ion pairing followed by bonding to the surface on calcining (with molybdena species replacing the OH groups of alumina) has also been proposed by Wang and Hall [11]. According to Hall [12], on drying, ammonia is evolved and, on heating, the OH groups become neutralized, releasing HgO. Furthermore, according to Hall and Lojacono [13], molybdic acid reacts with rather basic OH groups which terminate the alumina surface and substitute for an extension of the lattice. Several other authors also agree that ions from the impregnation solution can exchange with surface OH groups during impregnation (14 16], drying and calcination [17, 18]. A condensation reaction resulting in the elimination of the protonated OH groups as water, as proposed by Knozinger [19], can thus take place on drying and calcining also m the case of those ions (such as perrhenate) that adsorb via electrostatic ion pairing only, after decomposition and release of ammonia, while the ions are in a solvated state. While most perrhenate, permanganate and chromate can be removed by rinsing [9], molybdate and tungstate can only partially be removed, a finding that is consistent with the work of Van Veen et al. [15, 16] and Mensch et al. [20]. These authors suggest that two types of Al34' sites (coordinatively unsaturated AI3\"*' sites) and basic hydroxyl groups are re- sponsible for the adsorption of molybdate. The role of the pH of the impregnation solution in the genesis of the precursor structures in 6 and 12 wt.% Re-oxide-alumina catalysts is illustrated by the addition of HC1 [21] to the aqueous ammonium perrhenate solution used in the preparation of the catalysts by pore impregnation: the promoted 6 wt.% 'HC1' Re-oxide-alumina catalyst is much more active in the metathesis of methyl oleate than the corresponding standard one, the effect being lost at a loading of 12 wt.%. (This latter result is important as it indicates that the enhancement is not due to the incorporation of the chloride ion into the alumina matrix.) 361 This result underlines the key role of the electrostatic ion pairing process involved in adsorption: when the extent of the protonation is increased, less basic (more acidic) OH groups become accessible to rhenia. This should be brought into relationship with the enhanced activity observed when using perrhenic acid instead of ammonium perrhenate in impregnation, as reported m the patent literature. Consistent with this picture is the observation that the more acidic the solution, the higher the loading obtained when an equilibrium adsorption technique is used in catalyst preparation [22]. Depending on what face of the defect spinel structure terminates the alumina lattice, up to five different OH species (and five frequencies in the OH stretching region) may show up in infrared spectra [23]. As these OH species occur in various configurations differing in coordination number, they carry different net charges [24] (with a net positive charge of +0.5 being the most acidic): the ease of removal of the OH groups should parallel their basicity since the remaining net positive charge at the 'hole' or anion vacancy is lower, the higher the net negative charge of the leaving OH group. The work of Hall [12] has provided some substantiation of this. The IR spectroscopic study of alumina and molybdena-alumina catalysts of varying loading, prepared by an equilibrium impregnation technique, shows, for the alumina support, a convolution of three main vy^ bands, one at approximately 3785 cm\"1, (corresponding to an OH with a net charge of 0.5 [Knozinger]), one at approximately 3740 cm\"1 (corresponding to an OH with a net charge of 0) and one at approximately 3700 cm\" t (corresponding to an OH with a net charge of +0.5) (see Fig. 1). Moreover, by comparing the intensities of the three peaks at different loadings, one can see that the ease of removal of the OH groups parallels their basicity. The results of Olsthoorn and Boelhouwer are in substantial agreement with this picture [25]. In view of the role played by the surface hydroxyls of alumina, one would expect the above adsorption model (eqn. (1)) to be valid for sil- ica alumina too, when the pH of the impregnating solution is lower than the IEP of this material. Thus, assuming an electrostatic model for the adsorption, we would obtain, on adsorption, rhenia at Al OH, and at Si OH (both isolated OH and bridging (acid) OH), depending on pH and concentration. Xu Xiaoding et al. [26] report a decrease in the intensity of the 3745 cm\"1 band corresponding to increasing rhenia loading on silica-alumina (HA). A band at 3740-3745 cm-1 corresponds [24] to OH on Al (the band corresponding to isolated silanol, the species involved in chromate binding [27] is at 3750 cm~1). During impregnation the perrhenate ion seems to preferentially interact with these hydroxyls, probably because they are more easily protonated. Spectroscopic information on the isolated silanols and the bridging (acidic) hydroxyls is not abundant: a peak corresponding to this latter species is found at 3660 cm\" t, according to Tanabe [28]; a band corresponding to bridging hydroxyls shows up in the IR at 3640 cm\" t in the work of Angell and Schaffer [29]. Under the right conditions bridging (acidic) hydroxyls can also be involved in a condensation reaction (see below under Modification of the support). 362 4000 3800 3600 3400 waven umbers Fig. 1. IR spectra for the Mo-oxide-alumina catalyst. The numbers indicate wt.% Mo03. Adapted from [12]. If the condensation reaction (following the adsorption of rhenia) would involve these bridging hydroxyls, leading to the formation of Si O Re linkages, the Bronsted acidity of the catalyst would probably decrease with loading. Xiaoding et al. [26] find the Bronsted acidity to increase with loading, suggesting that the condensation reaction takes places to a very limited extent, if at all. In other words, most of the electrostatic ion pairs formed during adsorption are preserved, their density depending on the calcination temperature. The model for Re-oxide alumina and Re-oxide silica alumina catalysts The study of rhenia alumina catalysts by means of spectroscopic tech- niques gave rise to various models but could not produce a unified one. On one hand, the in situ study of Nakamura et al. [30] suggests (Re04)ads species of tetrahedral symmetry at low coverage and (ReaC^ads species at higher coverage. Monomeric adsorbed rhenia species, having tetrahedral symmetry, are also found by Kerkhof et al. [31]. The Laser Raman/XANES spectroscopic work of Hardcasue et al. [32] indicates that, in absence of water, the nature of the rhenium oxide species may depend on the loading: there exists, at low loading, an atomically dispersed phase consisting of (ReO^ads having Cg^ symmetry, while, at high 363 loading, there would be a second surface species, not completely known. The Csv symmetry is consistent with the presence of three equivalent terminal Re 0 bonds and one inequivalent Re 0 bond as part of the Re O Al linkage to the alumina support. Only monomeric rhenia species bound to alumina and possessing distorted tetrahedral symmetry were found by Wang and Hall [22] in catalysts prepared by an equilibrium adsorption technique over a wide range of pH. No evidence of dimeric species is reported. On the other hand, Ellison et al. [33] propose, on the basis of their extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and their previous fast atom bombardment (FAB MS) spectroscopic studies, a model featuring, at high loadings, thick clumps or clusters of Re04-like material having RegOy character on the surface. At low loading, where the dispersion is higher but the Re environment remains unchanged, the model presents 'rafts' or islands of RegOY-like material. A completely different model involving a monolayer aluminium meso- perrhenate, stabilized on alumina and not excluding some accommodations of Re(IV) and ReCVI) ions, has been proposed by Edreva-Kardjieva and Andreev [34]. This model features Re in a high coordination state. A rhenia distribution characterized by high dispersion is expected on silica alumina. Intervention of the OH groups, as is the general case, will cause rhenia to adsorb in correspondence to Al OH and Si OH terminal groups. The change in the intensity of the 3745 cm\"1 peak at increasing loading is revealing [26], however, the possibility ofaperrhenate ion adsorbing at an Al34' ion involved in a bridged structure should not be overlooked. Activity measurements [8, 35] with Re-oxide catalysts based on various silica aluminas, with an aluminium loading in the range 0 to 24 wt.%, in the metathesis of propene and methyl oleate, indicate that the most active catalyst is that corresponding to the highest density of surface aluminium atoms, as can be obtained, for a given Al loading, by increasing the specific surface or, for a given specific surface, by increasing the Al content of the silica alumina. A model for rhenia on silica-alumina must take into account the fact that on this support rhenia is again found at 'productive* and 'unproductive' locations and that, at low loadings (below 6 wt.%), a practically constant ratio exists between productive and unproductive rhenia, as indicated by the activity measurements. Rhenia at unproductive locations would be rhenia involved in electrostatic ion pairs, a species that sublimates before the condensation reaction can convert it to bonded rhenia. An important fact is that, independently from whether and how the bridging hydroxyls are involved in the adsorption process, some of the adsorbed rhenia will appear in the proximity of an (acidic) Si OH neighbour. The linkage Re 0 Si is not reported in the literature. The lack of such a linkage may result in lack of activity: in fact the Re-oxide silica catalyst appears to be inactive for metathesis [7], in agreement with Lin et al. [36] who claim that the olefin reduces the oxide to an inactive state. (However, 364 an active catalytic system can be obtained if aluminium is made available on the silica surface, even at loadings as low as 0.2 Al nm\"2 17].) Aluminium seems to play an important role not only m the adsorption of the precursor, but also in the formation of the precursor structures in metathesis, independently from whether it is associated with Re04~ in an electrostatic ion pair (in which case the symmetry of Re is tetrahedral) or m a Re O Al linkage, where the bonds have covalent character and the Re symmetry is Csv. There are various reasons to prefer this latter configuration as essentially related to the development of catalytic activity for metathesis. Moreover, coordinatively unsaturated surface aluminum ions, as a source of Lewis acidity, may be involved in initiation and other aspects of the metathesis. Modification of the support (catalyst) The changes brought about by the adsorption of molybdena on alumina, as described above, already constitute an important modification of the support, in relationship to the enhancement of the catalytic activity for the metathesis reaction. But the most important modifier for practical purposes is, for a variety of reasons, phosphorus. The modification can be made by using phosphoric acid, ammonium acid phosphate, (NH4)2HPC>4, or other sources of phosphate, in combination with various impregnation techniques. One most important modification of the alumina support is obtained when phosphate is introduced using (NH4)aHP04 by digestion [4 6]. According to Morales et al. [37], adsorption of phosphoric acid follows a Langmuir-type mechanism in which a phosphate ion monolayer is formed at the surface. Aluminium phosphate is preferentially formed, as also found by Mangnus et al. [38]. Similar results, indicating that phosphate is present as a monolayer, are also reported by Chadwick et al. [39]. An important question is how a deprotonated PC^3\" ion interacts with the surface m relationship to the possible formation of tri-, bi- and monodentate structures. This is a point worth further investigation, as the use of phosphate can lead to an increase in the number of exposed Al3'4\" ions. According to Gishti et al. [40], phosphate competes with molybdate for the free adsorption sites, the mechanism being one in which basic sites are involved. This similarity in behavior is relevant in modification. From the point of view of modification, phosphate is one of a family of substances that display common characteristics as modifiers, including molybdates, tungstates, vanadates, borates, etc. The dehydroxylation of the support as a result of modification can proceed to the almost complete elimination of the surface OH groups of alumina (thus including the acidic ones) when the adsorbed species has a strong acidic (protonating) character. The work of Mangnus et al.[38] shows the critical role of the modifier loading in the case of alumina modified with 365 H3PC>4 by pore impregnation. Their FTIR work shows that the characteristic rein bands of alumina almost disappear at a P loading of 2.6 wt.%. They observe bands at 3790, 3775, 3730 and 3675-3680 cm\"1, the latter one attributed to P-OH. Unfortunately, a new species, P OH, is introduced. Besides, this P loading is in far in excess of the stoichiometric requirement (calculated from the data of Knozinger [24] to be P=0.33): most interesting modifier effects for practical applications are already observed at loadings as low as this. These results are interesting because they show that, at high phosphate loadings, the main sequence of three bands characteristic of alumina is shifted to higher frequency: this could be expected when the adsorption of phosphate brings a change in the coordination number of the remaining hydroxyls, which would imply a second adsorption mechanism distinct from the prevailing one described above (see this in relationship to the work of Mensch et al. [20]). Alternatively, these higher frequency low intensity bands correspond to less acidic species present on the parent alumina that go unnoticed in the convolution of the three main ones. As for the acidity of phosphated aluminas, previous work produced some conflicting ideas on what seems to be a complex relationship between the acidity of the modified support and the phosphate loading, some authors claiming a slight increase in acidity, others a decrease. From the experiments of Fitz and Rase [41], phosphoric acid interacts with the various basic to acidic OH groups of alumina. When the acidic OH groups are involved, the acidity of the modified support may decrease (significant in this respect is the reduced activity for coke formation of the corresponding catalysts). At higher loadings phosphate may react with one OH group only, leading to a higher proportion of single bonding, and thereby introducing two acidic OH groups for every surface OH group eliminated. Therefore, they expected the acidity of the modified catalyst to pass through a minimum. Morales et al. [37] did not see such a minimum: the acidity was seen to increase monotonically with phosphate loading. They propose a different model: with increasing loading, phosphate interacts first with the basic groups of alumina, eliminating water. Once these basic groups have been titrated, acidic OH groups would begin to be titrated. Moreover, interactions could occur leading to the formation of linear di- and triphosphate chains. After this point the acidity could not increase, as two acid OH groups bound to Al would be replaced with two acid OH associated with P. Phosphorus adsorbed on alumina increases the number of weak acid sites only. Recent TPD/NHa work [42] indicates that the addition of phosphorus would decrease the number of strong Bronsted acidic sites on alumina and increase the number of those of medium strength. This would be in agreement with the observation of Gishti et al. [40], who showed that the skeletal isomerization of cyclohexene is reduced on phosphated alumina. It also is in agreement with reported attenuated activity for coke formation, Fitz and Rase [41]. This would be the case when phosphate, after neutralizing the 366 most basic sites of alumina, replaces the most acidic OH of alumina with less acidic of its own. Over a wide range of phosphate loadings, the phosphate modification does not introduce strong acidity. Phosphate, when present at moderate levels, can lead to increased performance without sacrificing selectivity, but it could lead to increased metathetic activity at the expense of selectivity when it introduces strongly acidic OH groups. A digestion procedure may not be effective in the modification of silica alumina, as it provides mild conditions similar to those of the equilibrium adsorption impregnation and because this support lacks the most basic OH groups of alumina. However, under the conditions of the pore impregnation, even the bridging OH groups may be involved, as indicated by the work done on the phosphate modification of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite by Vedrine et al. [43], who see both vyy. bands at 3730 and 3605 cm\"1 decrease in intensity with phosphate loading: phosphate can neutralize a large part of the acidic OH, but the strength of those remaining is still comparable to that of the OH groups of the unmodified zeolite. Decreased acidity is also reported by Seo and Ryoo [44] in the case of HZSM-5 in a TPD study using ammonia. Kaeding and Butter [45] propose a Si 0 PO(OH)2 structure for the modified zeolite, corresponding to the bridging OH. The relationship between modification and catalytic activity for metathesis The trends of the activity vs. loading for the standard Re-oxide- silica alumina and Re-oxide alumina catalysts in the metathesis of propene are shown m Fig. 2. Similar results obtained in the metathesis of methyl oleate are reported by Xu Xiaoding [47]. Molybdena, tungstena, vanadia and boria as modifiers for Re-oxide alumina catalysts, enhancing the activity of low-loading Re-oxide-alumina catalysts are reported by Xu Xiaoding et al. [47], who show that the intro- duction of a third (acidic) component can induce activity for the metathesis of methyl oleate in a catalytic system based on almost inactive, promoted, 3 wt.% rhenia-alumina catalyst. The activity as a function of the third-metal/ rhenium ratio was seen to go through a maximum, a feature that can easily be explained: initially the modifier takes the unproductive (basic) location, enhancing the catalytic activity, and then, at higher loadings, it competes with rhenia for the productive ones. The enhanced catalyst performance of phosphate modified Re-ox- ide alumina is documented in various patents [4-6] in which digestion procedures suited to the purpose are to be found. It is also shown in Fig. 3. This effect of phosphate has been observed at all loadings and in the case of the commercial type (Ketjen CK 300) and of y-alumina prepared from aluminium alkoxide (this case) [3]. The effect, more pronounced at low loadings, is attributed to an increase in the number of active sites. 367 35 :?() i^ + :IO 10 l (i time/h 10 Fig. 2.

(The organic feed contained 6.6 wt.%butene-l, 48.6 wt.% isobutene and 35.2 wt.% butene-2). However, as it is present even at high loadings where the density of the rhenia species exceeds the density of the productive locations, it seems to indicate that not only the number of active sites but also the catalyst stability may be affected. More results from activity measurements carried out by the author will be published in a separate article [3], in which information about the stability of the phosphated alumina-based catalysts as compared to that of the standard catalysts is to be found. The presence of active and inactive rhenia species on silica-alumina, as indicated by the activity measurements, should be seen in relationship to the practically 'ideal', straight trend of the activity vs. rhenia loading for the metathesis of propene on rhenia-silica-alumina catalysts, as previously observed in the metathesis of propene [8]. This trend can easily be explained. As only a fraction of the surface OH groups participating in adsorption are associated with productive locations, a practically constant ratio of rhenia at productive locations to rhenia at unproductive locations is obtained over a wide range of (low) loadings [48, 49]. Rhenia adsorbed at the unproductive locations is easily lost via sublimation when the calcination temperature exceeded 775 K without the activity and stability of the catalyst being affected [49]. Furthermore, these results suggest the OH species involved in the adsorption of the perrhenate ion on silica-alumina seem to possess much more uniform characteristics than those of alumina. Phosphate, applied by the digestion procedure, failed as a modifier of silica-alumina as it leads to unchanged or slightly lower activity in the case 368 of the 3 wt.% catalyst [49]. This is an indication that phosphate does not enter the active site structure through compound formation with rhenia. Lower activity for the Re-oxide silica-alumina catalyst modified by addition of molybdena and other modifiers via pore impregnation is also reported by Xu Xiaoding et al. [48]. This would be expected when phosphate competes with rhenia for the productive locations. This should be attributed to the fact that silica alumina misses the basic sites of alumina, where rhenia is preferentially adsorbed at low loadings. Relevant and consistent with this picture is the fact that silica alumina-based catalysts prepared with acidified ammonium perrhenate solutions showed no enhanced activity [49]. The role of acidity The FTIR work ofXu Xiaoding et al. [26] suggests a relationship between the surface Bronsted acidity and the activity for metathesis. Catalysts of enhanced acidity appear to perform better in the metathesis of propene [8, 26] and, when promoted, of methyl oleate [26, 37, 52]. In the case of the Re-oxide alumina catalysts, the trend of the Bronsted acidity seems to correlate well with the exponential trend of the activity as a function of the loading. As a result of the rhenia deposition on silica alumina, non-acidic OH groups are eliminated while the acidity of other surface OH groups is enhanced. Again the trend of the Bronsted acidity correlates with that of the catalytic activity. The activity of low-loading Re-oxide silica alumina catalysts is associated with Bronsted acidity, while the activity of Re-oxide alumina catalysts shows up at higher loadings where Bronsted acidity appears. The enhanced catalytic activity of other (modified) catalytic systems also cor- responds to an enhanced Bronsted acid function. These observations prompted the idea that this may be the experimental proof of an initiation mechanism featuring the involvement of Bronsted acidity in initiation [26, 47], as proposed by Laverty et al. [50]. The involvement of Bronsted acidity in propagation also seems a distinct possibility, if acidic OH groups are capable of interacting with polar substituents suppressing substrate poisoning. According to Xu Xiaoding [21] the surface OH groups interact with the cocatalyst: an indication of this is to be found in the metathesis of 1-octene on a Re-oxide silica alumina (HA) catalyst [7], where the addition of the cocatalyst leads to a decrease in the overall conversion but to an increase in the selective conversion. This is attributed to the inhibition of one of the isomerization mechanisms, namely that involving a classical carbonium ion. Because of the difference in the Bronsted acidity of alumina as compared with silica-alumina and of the basic OH groups present on alumina, at all loadings the Re-oxide alumina catalyst is less acidic than the Re-ox- ide silica alununa catalyst of corresponding loading, as indicated by the higher selectivity for 1-octene metathesis [7]. In the light of the adsorption mechanism proposed above, it is conceivable that the increase in Bronsted acidity with loading, both in the case of alumina 369 and silica-alumina, may also be due to incomplete condensation of the protonated OH groups, and thus to the presence of electrostatic ion pairs involving surface OH and perrhenic acid. Because of the complex way in which acidity can play a role, it is not now possible to accurately explain how it can affect catalytic activity for metathesis. In particular, it is not clear whether the Bronsted acidity is involved in initiation and/or propagation: the problem of the unpromoted metathesis is distinct from that of the promoted metathesis. In the latter case, probable initiation paths, in agreement with experimental evidence, can be conceived involving the appearance of an acidic OH on Re [2]. Conclusions In the absence of a modifier and at low loading, the adsorption of ammonium perrhenate on alumina proceeds through the formation of elec- trostatic ion pairs preferentially involving the most basic OH groups of the support. The subsequent elimination of these basic groups in a condensation reaction leads to Re-oxide bonded at the most basic locations of the alumina surface. At high loading the adsorption involves less basic and acidic OH groups. The development of catalytic activity for metathesis corresponds to Re-oxide forming bonds at these less basic and acidic locations. In the presence of a modifier interfering with the most basic OH groups of alumina, the modifier causes the Re-oxide to bind at less basic and acidic locations even at low loading. This corresponds to the enhancement of the catalytic activity of low-loading Re-oxide alumina catalysts through modi- fication. In its simplest form an effective modification consists in the formation of electrostatic ion pairs in correspondence with the most basic OH groups of the support. An effective permanent modification involves a condensation reaction leading to the elimination of such OH groups. The use of a modifier is effective when the support's surface carries basic locations at which rhenia may be adsorbed unproductively. The preferred use of a digestion procedure, as stressed in the patent literature dealing with phosphate, should be taken to mean that the introduction of the phosphate modifier selectively takes place in correspondence with the most basic OH groups of the support.Phosphate may contribute in other ways to the higher performance of the catalysts based on phosphated alumina through: (a) a lower rate for the intrinsic deactivation process (such as the reductive elimination to cyclopropene); (b) the introduction of medium strength Bronsted acidity; (c) possibly, the generation of exposed, coordinatively unsaturated Al3'1\" species. The modification introduced by phosphate bears similarity to that introduced by molybdena, tungstena, vanadia [51] and boria [52]. As phosphate does not appear to carry strongly acidic OH groups of its own over a broad range of phosphate loadings, it seems possible to enhance the activity for metathesis without sacrificing the selectivity. Thus, we may call 'unproductive' any rhenia adsorbed in correspondence of basic sites (low-loading Re-oxide-alumina catalyst) or adsorbed in the 370 form of electrostatic ion pairs that do not undergo condensation (Re-ox- ide-silica-alumina and high-loading Re-oxide-alumina catalysts). 'Productive' rhenia results from a condensation process involving neutral-to-acidic Al OH species, or from a distinct adsorption process, involving A13+ species, as mentioned elsewhere m this paper. As the basic groups of alumina selectively direct rhenia to unproductive locations, one may expect the low-loading Re- oxide silica alumina catalysts to contain a higher number of active sites than the corresponding Re-oxide alumina catalysts. A number of the most simple and probable structure models, featuring rhenia species bonded to Al atoms, possibly interacting with important surface species (other surface species not interacting are omitted) can be represented as shown below. Structures a to c2 can be proposed on the basis of: (1) the experimental evidence shown in Fig. 1 ; (2) the rationalization of the development of the catalytic activity as a function of Re-oxide loading as shown in Fig. 2 for y-alumina, on the basis of the same adsorption model; (3) the rationalization of the enhancement of the catalytic activity of phosphated aluminas CFig. 3, [3]) on the basis of the widely accepted adsorption model reviewed above. Structures a and b: found at the most basic locations where rhenia can coordinate one or two basic surface species (0~, OH basic) and display a more distinct anionic character. Besides, these basic species would block the bond directions that must be free for the formation of the metallocy- clobutane ring. Another relevant aspect is the absence of Lewis acidity, as required for lowering the energy barrier that separates the carbene from the metallocyclobutane [53], and as may be needed at some crucial step during initiation or propagation: at some stage Kress et al. [54] found the Lewis acid bonded to the active site. At low loading, most of the rhenia is taken up in structures of this type. Structure cl, c2: Structure cl corresponds to rhenia taking the place of an acidic OH group on alumina. This is a productive structure in non- 0 0=Re=o 0 0=Re=0 0 0~ OH basic 0 0=Re=o i 0 /////////////// _a 0 II Re b 0 II 0 = Re = 0 /////////////// cl // l \\\\ i 000 0 OH acid l l i L | l /////////////// /////////////// c2 d 371 functionalized olefin M, as it features strong local L acidity, in the form of one or more coordinatively unsaturated Al3\"1\" ions. In this case, a cocatalyst is not required for initiation unless the substrate carries polar groups capable of 'poisoning' the site. This structure can be found on silica alumina when rhenia binds to an Al atom not involved m and not interacting with a bridging hydroxyl structure. In the case where the local L acidity is too weak or the substrate presents initiation problems of its own, the highest activity may be obtained only when using a cocatalyst. In the case where the perrhenate ion exchanged with an acidic OH at locations of- coordination three, c2 should be considered as an alternative preferred configuration. This bears some similarity to the structure proposed by Nakamura et al. [30], which needs clarification in relationship to possible initiation mechanisms. The available information does not suggest a role for a second rhenium atom present in a dimer configuration: it would lead to an increase in the number of ligands and make initiation problematic. This also seems to be the problem with the mesoperrhenate structure proposed by Edreeva-Kardjieva and Andreev [34]. These arguments accentuate the role of the support structure in metathesis. Structure d: As high catalytic activity is most often seen associated with Bronsted acidity, it is an open question whether this should be considered as a precursor structure. Such a structure is formed when the perrhenate adsorbs on an Al involved in bridged hydroxyl structure or located in its proximity. In this latter case a most acidic OH group is found in the vicinity of the precursor rhenia species. The importance of a strategically located neutral-to-acidic OH group may show up when the polar group of a func- tionalized olefin, having to 'choose' between the active site and an optimally located dipolar group, it chooses the latter. As the catalytic activity depends on several parameters (unlike alumina, active sites are formed on silica alumina at low loadings!), it is still an open question whether the Bronsted acidity plays an active role in promotion, initiation and/or propagation. A structure of type d can be formed on alumina at high loadings too, but then one should consider other mechanisms for the adsorption besides the general one mentioned above. For instance, adsorption of a perrhenic acid molecule at a O^/Al3'1\" pair or from adsorption of a perrhenate ion on an Al3\"1' adjacent to a (protonated) acidic OH group (the work of Mensch et al. [20] and Mangnus et al. [38] provides some support in favour of a distinct mechanism of adsorption involving Al3\"1\", and showing up as a shift to higher frequency of the peaks corresponding to the surface OH groups of alumina). Such a structure has been proposed by Nakamura et al. [30] as a probable structure of the Re species on alumina at low-loading. The formation of structures a and b, proceeding through the elimination of the most basic OH groups of alumina, would result in an enhanced Bronsted acidity of the catalyst. The formation of structure c, assuming that the condensation reaction involving the acidic OH groups of alumina proceeds to near completion, should lead to a decrease in the Bronsted acidity. Thus the Bronsted acidity as a function of loading would go through a point of 372 maximum. Actually, according to Xu Xiaoding [26], it increases exponentially. To account for this observation, the origin of Bronsted acidity should be traced to the existence of electrostatic ion pairs (eqn. 1), involving Al OH surface groups (and Si OH groups in the case of silica-alumina), that do not undergo the condensation reaction. It should also be related to Re promoting the acidity of an OH neighbour [21, 26] (this would be the case when the OH group penetrates the coordination sphere of Re) and to the existence of adsorption process that do not entail condensation, such as the distinct process mentioned elsewhere in this paper. Another open question is whether the fact that the catalytic activity shows a maximum when the Al content of silica-alumina is about 24 wt.% corresponds to optimal ratios of the three partners occuring in this structure ('i.e. Re, neighbour OH and L site). As for the question how structures cl and c2 are to undergo initiation, the proposed schemes can be classified into two types, depending on whether substitution of an 0 ligand takes place or not. The initiation without substitution of an 0 ligand can be illustrated with Scheme 1 for the promoted initiation of the rhenium-oxide alumina catalyst, which has been proposed on the basis of new developments [55], (see also [2] and references therein). The scheme features an active site with Re in coordination five and an oxidation state of seven. The following discussion will be limited to Re in this oxidation state. According to this scheme, the substitution of an 0 ligand is not necessary: the key step of the initiation is the formation of an alkyi on Re. In the case of the unpromoted initiation, one should consider that the net process converting an olefin molecule into a carbene (or metallacyclo- butane), as illustrated by several initiation schemes [56] and [57, 58] is an oxidative addition requiring (1) at least two electrons at the metal center, (2) the metal in a low coordination state and, possibly, (3) the presence of mobile hydrogen atoms. The results of Olsthoom and Boelhouwer [25] indicate that ethene cannot initiate, but initiation is possible with higher olefins (having H in the allylic position). They strongly indicate that hydrogen abstraction takes place at room temperature, as the OH groups of the alumina support, eliminated during adsorption of the active precursor and subsequent calcination, are partially restored. They also indicate that the development of catalytic activity 0 R3Sn - 0 R R3Sn - 0 CH - R' II \\/ \\// 0=Re=0 SnR< 0=Re=0 H ' transfer 0=Re OH 00 0 La l.b l.c Scheme 1. 373 is related to the duration of the interaction, when the olefin is admitted at reduced pressure (100 mmHg). Thus, the first stages of the interaction with the olefin bear similarity to the initiation stages in the mild oxidation of the olefin, which is a process that puts electronic charge on the metal center. Accordingly, the following initiation can be conceived as shown in Scheme 2. Structure 2.c satisfies all three criteria above. It features a slow hydrogen extraction in the first step, which should be related to the relatively short transient seen during the initial phase of the contact. The second step features the incorporation of oxygen onto the carbon chain and generation of the necessary electronic charge on the metal. The third step shows the interaction with an olefin molecule to produce the initial carbene (or metallocyclobutane). It stops short of the formation of an aldehyde molecule because it is not certain whether this is attained at room temperature: the slow formation of such a species (or other oxidation species) may lead to overreduction and deactivation along one of several important paths. (The hydrogen abstraction process itself is one that can cause overreduction.) Aldehydes are not reported as initiation products from low-temperature metathesis catalytic systems. An aldehyde was not among the 'condensable' initiation products detected by Olsthoom and Boelhouwer [25]: the authors give no spectroscopic information in that region of the spectrum where the C==0 vibrations are to be found. Aldehydes may go undetected when not properly sought: they may be lost when the vacuum is pulled before recording the spectrum [25, 59]. They may also go undetected when formed in a slow process and in minimal amounts, or when the alkoxy ligand undergoes fragmentation. Besides, aldehydes with allylic hydrogen can undergo further hydrogen abstraction and react further [59]. 0 ^ HO --..

Consistent with an allylic scheme is also the fact that water and molecular oxygen act as catalyst poisons in this case, as can be expected of species that strongly adsorb on metals in a low coordination state [59]. Sokolovskii and Bulgakov [61] looked at this process in a somewhat different way, not incompatible with the above scheme. According to them, an efficient catalyst for propylene oxidation should contain two types of oxygen: nucleophilic (for the first hydrogen abstraction) and electrophilic (for the incorporation of oxygen in the organic fragment). (In the case of very efficient catalysts for the mild oxidation of olefins [62], this is normally obtained by combining an amphoteric oxide with the oxide of a high-valent element.) The presence of Lewis acidity could thus be involved in the activation of structure 2.a. A distinct function of the Lewis acidity at a later stage would be to lower the charge density on the metal center in order to favour the adsorption of a second olefin molecule for the oxidative addition. This could possibly (but not necessarily) involve an Re H species formed via intra- or intermolecular transfer of mobile hydrogens. In the case where the amphoteric support is directly involved in the first hydrogen abstraction, as is the case for the BigOg MoOa catalyst [62], structure 2.c above would carry an 0 ligand at the site of the OH and would be paramagnetic. One would have to postulate charge transfers involving the support and the involvement of the Lewis acidity in order to arrive at a reasonable carbene structure and the discussion would be purely speculative. Structure 2.c contains a number of mobile hydrogens and these may end up in the support, and restore the OH groups to the alumina, as documented spectroscopically [25]. Theoretical studies [53] and gas phase observations have led to a different scheme, wherein a highly oxidized species undergoes a reduction reaction to produce, according to a well-known scheme, a metal carbene and an aldehyde on reaction with an olefin [63]. The observation that ethene does not initiate on the Re-oxide-alumina catalyst at room temperature is not sufficient to rule out such a scheme: there may be important differences in activation energy for the generation of the initial carbene in the case of ethene, as it can only generate a carbene with one carbon atom. Such a scheme, however, cannot account for the observed hydrogen abstraction, which should then be considered as a side process. Acknowledgement The author is indebted to Mr G. C.
