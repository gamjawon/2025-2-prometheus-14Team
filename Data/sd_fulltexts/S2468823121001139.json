Graphical abstract We hydrogenated furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) in water in a reaction catalyzed by Pd nanoparticles on carbonaceous materials with different morphology and hydrophobic degree. The different Pd catalysts were prepared by dipping the carbonaceous material into a Pd0 micro-emulsion. The catalyst support affected the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural and HMF. By using micrometric active carbon (AC) combined with cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) and Pd0/2+ nanoparticles (Pd), we obtained a micro/nanostructured material designated Pd/CSCNT-AC, which performed better than the other carbonaceous materials containing similar Pd nanoparticle loading. Pd/CSCNT-AC produced tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol from furfural with excellent selectivity (>99 %). Unlike Pd on hybrophobic spheroid graphite or hydrophilic AC, Pd/CSCNT-AC hydrogenated both the CO and CC double bonds of furfural and catalyzed HMF hydrogenation at the CO double bond more selectively: between 85 % and 99 % selectivity toward 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran. We also investigated how temperature, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time affected HMF hydrogenation in water. Finally, Pd/CSCNT-AC was recycled several times without significant catalytic activity loss.

Among such products, a major focus has been placed on furfural and 5-(hydroxyl-methyl)-furfural (HMF), which can be easily obtained from pentoses and hexoses, respectively [5,6]. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Energy has listed furfural and HMF among the ten most important classes of biomass-derived molecules [4]. Furfural represents a truly sustainable chemical platform for several green applications [7,8]. Its low oxygen content makes it a promising alternative chemical resource and a useful raw material in the fine chemical industry [9,10]. In turn, HMF has been one of the most studied compounds in recent years: it is a potential starting material to prepare bio-based chemicals, such as biopolymers and liquid biofuels, and to synthesize chemical derivatives of high commercial value [11,12]. HMF bears many functional groups, including CO, CO, and CC, and a furan ring, which make it amenable to various transformations. In this context, furfural and HMF hydrogenation yield building blocks that could replace petrochemicals in numerous applications [13–16]. However, selectively upgrading furfural and HMF to the desired product is challenging. For example, HMF hydrogenation generally gives a mixture of side chain- and ring-hydrogenated products along with ring-opening products [5,10]. In the presence of a catalyst containing 5 wt% Pd nanoparticles supported on traditional commercial carbonaceous materials; e.g., Pd/C, HMF hydrogenation occurs through three types of reactions: decarbonylation to furfuryl derivatives, conversion to dimethylfuran, and hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis to tetrahydrofurans [17]. Another issue of upgrading furfural and HMF is that such reactions require vast quantities of solvents, which has raised environmental concerns. From a green chemistry viewpoint, performing catalytic reactions in water is more attractive [18]. Recently, direct liquid-phase furfural hydrogenation to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) over Ni-Pd/SiO2, Pd-Ir/SiO2, Ni-Pd/TiO2-ZrO2, Pd/MFI, Pd/M-AC, and Pd/Al2O3 as catalysts has been described [19], and catalyst support has been shown to influence how the catalyst performs during liquid-phase catalytic furfural hydrogenation. Pd catalysts have been thoroughly evaluated in total furfural hydrogenation to THFA. In the case of vapor phase furfural hydrogenation under severe temperature and pressure conditions (200–300 °C and 10 MPa of H2), noble metal catalyst systems yield not only the desired products, but also byproducts that include furan, tetrahydrofuran, and even ring-opening products, like pentanol and pentanediols [20]. Thus, selective furfural hydrogenation remains challenging because it is difficult to control the reaction route and the hydrogenation degree mainly in the presence of water [21]. On the other hand, HMF conversion to DHMF (2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran) via CO hydrogenation or to BHMTHF (2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran) via further CC furan ring hydrogenation can be highly selective (80–100 %) when heterogeneous catalysts based on Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd, or Ru are employed in organic medium or neutral solution [21,22]. In acidic solution, the major products are 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione and 1,2,5-hexanetriol. Pd, Pt, Re, and Ir are also excellent catalysts for selective hydrogenation of the HMF aldehyde moiety [23]. HMF hydrogenation in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts has been extensively studied, especially in the case of catalysts containing one or more metals belonging to the Pd group, and affords products such as DHMF, BHMTHF, and/or ring-opening, deoxygenated, and decarbonylated products, depending on the harshness of the conditions [23]. A comparison of catalytic systems, including the role played by the catalytic nanoparticles at the molecular level and the experimental conditions, has recently been published for furfural and HMF hydrogenation [6,21,23–27]. Nevertheless, the effect of several Pd oxidation states on the hydrogenation, adsorption, or reaction of furan-based compounds remains unknown, and the role that the carbon support plays in heterogeneous Pd nanoparticle catalysts in the presence of water as solvent is unclear. Additionally, the field of green chemistry lacks comparative studies about catalysts containing hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces with different morphology. For this reason, we have decided to investigate furfural and HMF hydrogenation catalyzed by Pd nanoparticles at similar oxidation states supported on three distinct micrometric carbonaceous substrates. The first substrate was natural micrometric hydrophobic spheroid graphite (G) consisting of crumpled graphite basal planes that form a potato that is difficult to wet, but which is relatively denser than graphite crystals floating in aqueous medium [28]. The second substrate was a commercial activated carbon resulting from eucalyptus pyrolysis followed by activation (AC), which can adsorb water in its pores [29]. The third substrate was a micro/nanostructured composite consisting of AC whose surface is covered with entangled carbon nanotubes with walls containing hydrophobic cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) with the extremity vertically attached to the AC surface [30–33]. CSCNTs can be prepared under specific CNT growth conditions and are not a commercial structure such as SWCNTs or MWCNTs. CSCNTs consist of diagonally stacked graphene walls and a hollow central conic channel, so their walls should be rich in dangling bonds that can favor the adsorption of chemical species [32,34]. However, more recently, hydrophobic CSCNTs have been shown to present special wettability properties even under high-vacuum conditions [35]. In fact, unlike hydrophobic CSCNTs, CSCNTs on the surface of hydrophobic carbonaceous materials have been reported to make the resulting composite hydrophilic [33]. So far, the use of CSCNT-AC has been little investigated in the field of catalysis or not investigated at all in the presence of water [36–38] even though CSCNT-AC with different surfaces, shapes, and hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic sites can be synthesized, and its micro/nanostructure seems to diminish the environmental impact of nanostructures that contain CNTs [39]. Furthermore, CSCNT-AC does not demand CSCNT functionalization for dispersion in aqueous medium to be achieved. Therefore, we have evaluated whether Pd/CSCNT-AC is a selective catalyst for furfural and HMF hydrogenation in water. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials Furfural, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), n-heptane, NaBH4, and PdCl2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethyl acetate was acquired from Tedia, and the surfactant Brij® 30 was obtained from Across Organics. Activated carbon (AC) (particle size = 325 mesh) and spheroid graphite (G) were purchased from Alpha Carbo Industrial. 2.2 Instrumentation The metal content in Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC was determined by atomic absorption on a ContrAA 700 (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) apparatus. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed on a FEI-Quanta 650 FEG and FEI Inspect F50 microscopes, and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted on a JEOL JEM-100cx 485 microscope. The starting material conversion rate and the product ratio after the hydrogenation reactions were determined on a gas chromatograph (GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an FID detector and a Restek Rtx-5® fused silica capillary column (30 m length x0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 μm film thickness) operating at temperatures ranging from 40 to 280 °C. The products were identified by comparison with standard samples and by analyses on a Shimadzu GC/MS QP-2010spectrometer (Shimadzu) operating with electron-impact ionization (EI, 70 eV). The metal content in Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. To this end, approximately 20 mg of the catalyst (Pd/G, Pd/AC, or Pd/CSCNT-AC) was digested with 5 mL of concentrated HCl for 30 min. Then, the solution was filtered through a filter paper and diluted to 10.00 mL in a volumetric flask. The Pd nanoparticle dispersion on CSCNTs extracted from the Pd/CSCNT-AC surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) experiment was carried out with an Al K-α X-ray source in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (10−9 torr). Mn 2p was recorded with energy resolution of 0.1 eV, dwell time of 1.0 s, and Constant Analyzer Energy (CAE) of 100 eV. The XPS data were calibrated by using the binding energy (B.E.) of the C 1s (C–C) peak at 284.8 eV. The spectra were fitted by means of the Fityk 1.3.1 software with the aid of the Voigt function [40,41]. 2.3 Composite preparation The disordered CSCNT-AC composite substrate was prepared by using exactly the same type of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactor and growth parameters described by Matsubara et al. [30]. CSCNTs were grown at 650 °C under methanol vapor/nitrogen; Mn/Co was employed as catalyst. The CSCNT concentration in the AC was 30 wt%; the Mn/Co catalyst concentration was ∼10 wt%. Before the Pd nanoparticles were incorporated into the CSCNT-AC, the substrate was washed with concentrated HCl, which was followed by successive washings with deionized water. This procedure was applied to extract any Mn/Co nanoparticles that could be covering the graphene layers on the CSCNT tips. 2.4 Pd catalyst preparation Metallic Pd nanoparticles were incorporated into G, AC, or CSCNT-AC by reverse microemulsion of water in organic phase and surfactant (Brij® 30). First, the microemulsions were prepared by adding a 0.10 mol L−1 aqueous solution (5.2 g) of the metal precursor (PdCl2 in 0.1 mol L−1 HCl) to a mixture of n-heptane (28.3 g) and Brij® 30 (10.0 g) under stirring at 40 °C. The overall composition of the prepared microemulsion was 12 wt% H2O, 23 wt% Brij® 30 or polyethyleneglycol-dodecylether, and 65 wt% n-heptane. The Pd salt was reduced by rapidly adding a 2.00 mol L−1 NaBH4 aqueous solution (5.2 g) to the emulsion, and the mixture was kept under stirring at 40 °C for 30 min. This procedure yielded a black Pd° microemulsion. Next, an appropriate amount of G, AC, or CSCNT-AC was added to the same volume of the microemulsion prepared above, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h in the case of G and AC. As for CSCNT-AC, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h to increase the efficiency of Pd incorporation into CSCNT-AC. The resulting Pd catalysts (Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC) were filtered through 0.22-μm PVDF membranes (Merck-Millipore), rinsed thoroughly with ethanol, and dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Several catalysts were prepared by depositing different Pd concentrations over the three types of supports, to afford Pd/G (0.7 and 2.2 wt%), Pd/AC (1.0 and 1.7 wt%), and Pd/CSCNT-AC (0.9 and 2.0 wt%). The specific surface areas of Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC, determined from BET N2 isotherms, were 95, 210, and 148 m2 g−1, respectively. 2.5 Furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) catalytic hydrogenation Furfural and HMF hydrogenation reactions were carried out in a 150-mL stainless steel reactor under magnetic stirring. The reaction temperature was controlled with a thermostatic silicone oil bath. 50 mg of furfural (0.52 mmol) or HMF (0.40 mmol) and 5 mg of the catalyst (Pd/G, Pd/AC, or Pd/CSCNT-AC) were suspended in 6 mL of deionized water. The vessel was purged with hydrogen three times and pressurized with hydrogen at the desired pressure. The reaction mixture was stirred under certain experimental conditions for the desired time. After the reaction was complete, the reactor was rapidly cooled to room temperature in cold water bath and depressurized. The reaction mixture was filtered through filter paper, to remove the catalyst. The aqueous phase obtained after filtration was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 5 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the starting material conversion rate and the product ratio. Then, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was analyzed by FTIR, 1H and 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy to confirm the product structures. Furfural or HMF conversion and product selectivity were calculated by using the following expressions: Conversion % = 1 − mole of furfural/HMF at particular time initial mole of furfural/HMF × 100 Selectivity % = mole of product X mole of all products formed × 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 CSCNT-AC composite and Pd catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows the SEM pictures of typical Pd/CSCNT-AC (Pd 2.0 wt%), Pd/AC (Pd 1.7 wt%), and Pd/G (Pd 2.2 wt%) grains. Pd/CSCNT-AC (Fig. 1A and B) displayed a dense network of entangled CSCNTs that covered the AC particle surface completely, but we also observed several cavities or nanometric pores. There was no CSCNT coating inside the large AC cavities (Fig. 1B). The CSCNTs had different diameter, length, and curvature. Thus, the AC substrate shape and its surface porosity influenced the architecture of the resulting CSCNT coating network. In addition, detailed SEM analyses demonstrated that all the samples presented Pd nanoparticle clusters. These clusters probably originated during the filtration procedure conducted after Pd nanoparticles were incorporated into the G, AC, or CSCNT-AC support. As for the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements, the inset figures show Pd clusters in highlight. Therefore, when we immersed CSCNT-AC into the Pd nanoparticle microemulsion and filtered the material, some Pd nanoparticle agglomeration also occurred on the grain surface of the samples. However, we believe that many Pd nanoparticles should be present on the surface of the samples and tubes. We also analyzed Pd/CSCNT-AC by TEM to try to see the smaller Pd nanoparticles on the CSCNT walls. Nevertheless, to obtain the TEM grids, we submitted the sample to milling and ultrasonic treatment, which may have extracted the Pd nanoparticles that were formed on the CSCNT surface. Despite the relative low resolution of the TEM pictures, we observed that several Pd nanoparticles measuring less than 5 nm adsorbed onto the external walls of the CSCNTs, which in turn had diameter ranging from 30 to 80 nm (Fig. S1, Supplementary data). In the case of AC (Fig. 1C) and G (Fig. 1D), besides Pd nanoparticle agglomeration, we believe that the AC and G surface contained Pd nanoparticles dispersed across the whole surface. G presented the typical potato shape and consisted of several crystals stacked on top of each other. The edge of the graphite crystals concentrated most of the Pd clusters (inset Fig. 1D). On the other hand, AC contained randomly formed Pd clusters (Fig. 1C). The reason why Pd nanoparticle clusters were present in the samples was not clear, but they might be associated with extraction of the substrate from the Pd microemulsion. We collected additional SEM pictures in the backscattering mode so as to understand cluster formation better (see Fig. S2–S4, Supplementary data). In this mode, the brightest regions indicate clusters with higher concentration of Pd nanoparticles than the regions with less intensity. These SEM analyses suggested that, at 2.5 %, the Pd cluster areas increased in the following order: Pd/G, Pd/CSCNT-AC, and Pd/AC. Furthermore, the intensity of bright spots showing the cluster scenario in the samples was always less intense for Pd/AC than for Pd/CSCNT-AC, and Pd/G was clearly the sample that contained the most intense spots. When the Pd concentration was increased to 5%, cluster distribution in the samples presented a similar trend. Some spots for Pd/AC become more intense than in the case of Pd/CSCNT-AC, suggesting that the porous morphology of Pd/AC dispersed the Pd nanoparticles less than the entangled CSCNT network on AC, while the curved basal planes of spheroidal graphite tended to accumulate particles in regions near the curved edges. Fig. 2 illustrates the XPS spectra of Pd 3d (5/2 and 3/2) on Pd/CSCNT-AC, Pd/CSCNT-AC submitted to reuse, Pd/AC, or Pd/G observed by SEM analysis. After the spectra were fitted, the Pd/CSCNT-AC (Pd 2.0 wt%), Pd/AC (Pd 1.7 wt%), and Pd/G (2.2 wt%) spectra displayed two bands around 335 and 337 eV, which were clearly associated with the presence of Pd in both the zero and divalent states (Pd0/2+). Pd/CSCNT-AC disclosed the highest Pd° concentration, as deduced from the area of the curves employed to fit the spectrum. On the other hand, fitting of the spectrum of the reused Pd/CSCNT-AC sample required a third band around 338 eV, attributed to the presence of Pd4+ nanoparticles, whereas Pd/AC and Pd/G had similar XPS spectra (Fig. 2C and D), with practically the same Pd0/2+ concentration. Hence, Pd° present in the microemulsion was partially oxidized after adsorption onto the carbonaceous materials, and the Pd0/2+ nanoparticles in Pd/CSCNT-AC (Fig. 2A) also underwent partial oxidation after successive HMF hydrogenation in water (Fig. 2B). Taking these results into account, some Pd° nanoparticles from the microemulsion were oxidized to Pd2+ during Pd incorporation into the carbonaceous materials. The Pd° nanoparticles that were not bound to the carbon surface were probably oxidized by air atmosphere, too. However, Fig. 2B disclosed a more intense Pd signal after hydrogenation, while the pass energy had to be increased and the resolution was reduced in the other cases. This means that, the component peaks in other spectra were wide, and that more than two Pd components could exist. In fact, under the reaction condition, which included highly reducing atmosphere, black palladium (PdO) and PdO2 could be reduced to Pd°. This was probably because the reused catalyst samples were cleaner than the fresh catalyst, which had been washed with only ethanol before the hydrogenation reaction. Fig. 2C and D revealed similar XPS spectra for the G sample, a hydrophobic carbonaceous material completely free of oxygen groups, and the hydrophilic AC sample, which may contain oxygen. The XPS curves also provided the concentration of each oxidation state with an error of 5 % for all the samples: 70 % Pd° in Pd/G, where the G surface was rich in graphene edges or contained a region where dangling bonds were expected; 60 % Pd° in Pd/AC, which displayed a porous structure; 83 % Pd° in Pd/CSCNT-AC, where the disordered CSCNTs contained a large concentration of dangling bonds; and 55 % Pd°, 30 % Pd2+, and 15 % Pd4+ in reused Pd/CSCNT-AC. 3.2 Furfural hydrogenation We initially tested Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC as catalysts for furfural hydrogenation in water. We evaluated the catalytic activity and the selectivity of these Pd catalysts regarding furfural CO and CC double bond hydrogenation, to form FA and THFA, as outlined in Scheme 1 . We conducted the reactions at constant temperature (90 °C) and hydrogen pressure (3.4 MPa). Table 1 summarizes the results. Pd/G was the least active and the least selective catalyst for furfural hydrogenation (Table 1). Under the employed conditions, 0.7 % Pd/G converted only 15 % of furfural, with moderate selectivity toward FA (62 %) and low selectivity toward THFA (38 %) (Table 1, Entry 1). In contrast, 2.2 % Pd/G converted 65 % of furfural, with high selectivity toward THFA (91 %) (Entry 2, Table 1). 1.0 % Pd/AC and 1.7 % Pd/AC converted 28 % and 68 % of furfural, respectively, with preferential FA formation (57 % and 73 %, respectively) (Table 1, Entries 3–4). Comparing how these Pd/AC catalysts and 2.2 % Pd/G (Table 1, Entry 2) behaved is interesting. Despite providing a slightly lower conversion rate than the hydrophilic 1.7 % Pd/AC (Table 1, Entry 4), the hydrophobic 2.2 % Pd/G was more selective toward THFA (91 %). In this particular case, hydrogenation of the furfural CC double bond was faster when graphite was used as support. Bearing in mind that (i) Pd/CSCNT-AC was composed of hydrophilic AC and hydrophobic CSCNTs, (ii) its structure could confine water, as reported in reference 35, and (iii) Pd/CSCNT-AC displayed the largest Pd0 concentration among the catalysts evaluated herein, we found that this catalyst was the most active and selective during furfural hydrogenation. 0.9 % Pd/CSCNT-AC afforded reasonable furfural conversion (55 %) with excellent selectivity toward THFA (>99 %) (Table 1, Entry 5). 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC gave the best results, both in terms of furfural conversion (75 %) and selectivity toward THFA (>99 %) (Table 1, Entry 6), indicating that this catalyst hydrogenated the furfural CO and CC double bonds more actively. This may have resulted from the more stable conformation of furfural adsorbed on a Pd surface, which involved the furan ring lying flat and binding strongly to the metal surface [23]. Alternatively, this might have resulted from the strong interactions between the π electrons of the furan ring and the CSCNTs, which presumably enhanced adsorption of the furfural CO group along with adsorption of the furan ring, leading to total furfural hydrogenation to THFA and suppressing side reactions [21]. The support influenced catalyst performance during catalytic furfural hydrogenation. Our results proved very promising, mainly in the case of 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC (Table 1, Entry 6): they were superior to the results obtained in most catalytic processes that produce THFA from furfural. Several catalytic processes of furfural hydrogenation in the liquid phase have been patented; however, they require high temperatures (> 110 °C) and hydrogen pressures (> 10 MPa) for good selectivity toward THFA to be achieved, regardless of catalyst type [42]. Monometallic Pd supported over carbon, silica, and CaCO3 is little selective toward THFA under a wide range of temperatures (120–220 °C) and pressure (3.5–5 MPa), but Al2O3-supported systems present better catalytic performances [23]. Chuang Li et al. [19] described a promising result for a hydroxyapatite-supported Pd catalyst that they designed, prepared, and employed in furfural hydrogenation using 2-propanol as solvent. This catalyst showed high catalytic activity and 100 % selectivity toward furfural hydrogenation to THFA under relatively mild conditions (40 °C, 1 MPa, and reaction for 3 h) [19]. However, it is impossible to foresee how this type of catalyst performs in hydrogenation reactions in aqueous media medium. 3.3 HMF hydrogenation We investigated the catalytic activity and the selectivity of Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC during HMF CO and CC double bond hydrogenation in water, which could yield DHMF, HMTHF, and BHMTHF, as outlined in Scheme 2 . We studied the reactions under different conditions of temperature (90–130 °C), hydrogen pressure (3.4–4.8 MPa), and reaction time (1, 2, and 3 h). First, we tested G, AC, and CSCNT-AC without Pd nanoparticles during HMF hydrogenation at high temperature and hydrogen pressure (130 °C and 4.8 MPa of H2), but we did not detect any HMF conversion. 3.4 Temperature effect on HMF hydrogenation To examine how the reaction temperature affected HMF hydrogenation, we tested Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC at 90, 110, and 130 °C, at a constant hydrogen pressure of 3.4 MPa. Table 2 lists the results. Pd/G was less active than the other Pd catalysts with similar Pd concentration. 0.7 % Pd/G exhibited low activity (HMF conversion ∼ 4%) even at 130 °C, and so did 2.2 % Pd/G, but the latter was a little more active (HMF conversion ∼ 31 %). This small increase in activity decreased catalyst selectivity. Pd/AC was not very active, either. The maximum HMF conversion rate was 36 % even at the highest temperature (130 °C). Pd/AC also displayed low selectivity. For example, 1.7 % Pd/AC at 110 °C exhibited a selectivity of only 23 % toward DHMF and HMTHF, and other byproducts emerged. Compared to 2.2 % Pd/G and 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC, which had similar Pd concentration, 1.7 % Pd/AC had intermediate catalytic activity, but it generated a large quantity of byproducts at 130 °C. We did not identify DHMF or HMTHF as reaction products when the latter catalyst was used, but we detected considerable amounts of polymerization products and hydrogenolysis products, particularly 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydro-furan (both <1%). On the other hand, the hydrophilic 1.0 % Pd/AC exhibited low HMF conversion rate (<10 %) even with rising temperature. Nevertheless, 1.0 % Pd/AC selectivity toward DHMF dropped from >99 % to 80 % when we raised the temperature to 130 °C. Pd/CSCNT-AC afforded the highest catalytic activity under the employed reaction conditions. The selectivity of >99 % toward DHMF achieved with 0.9 % Pd/CSCNT-AC at all temperatures indicated that this material was the most selective during HMF hydrogenation. 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC was the most active catalyst of all, with HMF conversion rates ranging from 70 to 76 % at different reaction temperatures. On the other hand, at all the employed temperatures, 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC selectivity toward DHMF decreased to 85–87 %. The higher catalytic activity of Pd/CSCNT-AC toward selective HMF carbonyl hydrogenation was due to the high Pd° concentration. In addition, the graphene electrons of the CSCNTs extended to the Pd particles, which increased the metal charge density and made reactant adsorption through the CC double bonds more difficult, thereby shifting selectivity toward hydrogenation of the CO double bond [43]. Comparison of HMF and furfural hydrogenation catalyzed by 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC at 90 °C and hydrogen pressure of 3.4 MPa revealed different results. While furfural (Table 1, Entry 6) and HMF (Table 2, last line) hydrogenation in the presence of this catalyst produced similar furfural (75 %) and HMF (70 %) conversions, selectivity toward THFA and HMTHF was quite different (>99 % of THFA and 15 % of HMTHF). This result was probably due to the molecular orientation of HMF adsorbed on the surface of Pd/CSCNT-AC. Interaction of the furan ring with the active Pd sites was limited due to steric hindrance, i.e. when the Pd surface was fully covered with HMF and/or DHMF. This prevented BHMTHF from being formed by simultaneous hydrogenation of the furan ring and the formyl group. 3.5 Hydrogen pressure effect on HMF hydrogenation To examine the hydrogen pressure effect on HMF hydrogenation, we tested Pd/G, Pd/AC, and Pd/CSCNT-AC under hydrogen pressure varying from 3.4 to 4.8 MPa, at constant temperature (110 °C). Table 3 compiles the results. 0.7 % Pd/G showed low catalytic activity even under the highest hydrogen pressure. Concerning 2.2 % Pd/G, an increase in hydrogen pressure from 3.4 to 4.8 MPa enhanced HMF conversion from 17 % to >99 % (Table 3). However, selectivity toward DHMF decreased from >99 % to 48 %, and byproducts other than HMTHF arose. Regarding 1.0 % Pd/AC, higher hydrogen pressure augmented HMF conversion from 6 % to 46 %. However, byproduct formation also increased, consequently reducing 1.0 % Pd/AC selectivity toward DHMF from 99 % to 58 % (Table 3). In contrast, Pd/AC achieved maximum HMF conversion (67 %) under 4.8 MPa of H2. Selectivity toward HMTHF was only 33 %, but no DHMF emerged. These results suggested that higher hydrogen pressure mitigated the influence of the hydrophobic phase on the reaction. On the other hand, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic Pd/CSCNT-AC was less sensitive to hydrogen pressure. An increase in hydrogen pressure from 3.4 to 4.8 MPa practically did not affect HMF conversion in the case of 0.9 % Pd/CSCNT-AC (∼38 %). However, selectivity toward DHMF decreased from >99 % under 3.4 MPa of H2 to 89 % under 4.8 MPa of H2. As for 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC, an increase in hydrogen pressure from 3.4 to 4.8 MPa enhanced HMF conversion from 75 % to >99 % (Table 3). Again, increased hydrogen pressure reduced selectivity toward DHMF from 85 % to 76 % and favored HMTHF formation, which rose from 11 % to 24 %. Generally, mild reaction conditions (0.1–0.8 MPa of H2 and 15–60 °C) are required to limit the reaction toward DHMF formation from HMF. Higher reaction pressures (6–8 MPa of H2) lead to total HMF hydrogenation to BHMTHF. To our knowledge, the best catalytic performances for DHMF synthesis from HMF have been obtained with highly loaded 10 % Pd/C, which yielded 80 % DHMF at 90 % conversion at 60 °C and 0.1 MPa of H2 in 1,4-dioxane [23], and with a Cu/MgAlOx catalyst, which produced DHMF in 92.7 % yield at 100 % conversion at 180 °C and 1.0 MPa of H2 after reaction for 5 h in 1,4-dioxane [21]. The nature of the solvent affected product distribution. 1,4-Dioxane and water favored DHMF formation, while 1-propanol and 2-propanol shifted the reaction to hydrogenolysis and etherification products. Besides, competitive adsorption on the active sites between solvents and HMF might decrease HMF conversion [23]. 3.6 Reaction time effect on HMF hydrogenation To verify how the reaction time affected HMF hydrogenation, we carried out reactions at 110 °C and hydrogen pressure of 3.4 MPa for different times. Table 4 summarizes the results. 0.7 % Pd/G was completely inactive under the tested conditions. In turn, 2.2 % Pd/G yielded small HMF conversion (maximum of 34 % after 3 h), but it was highly selective toward DHMF (>99 % within 2 h of reaction). However, after reaction for 3 h, DHMF selectivity decreased from >99 % to 18 %, and byproducts other than HMTHF were favored. 1.0 % Pd/AC behaved similarly: HMF conversion was low (maximum of 16 % after 3 h); selectivity toward DHMF was high (>99 % within 2 h of reaction). Nevertheless, within only one extra hour, DHMF was totally consumed, producing 57 % of HMTHF and other byproducts. 1.7 % Pd/AC provided maximum HMF conversion of 53 % after 3 h, but selectivity toward both DHMF and HMTHF was low (Table 4). Pd/CSCNT-AC afforded the best results: HMF conversion and selectivity toward DHMF formation were higher as compared to the catalysts discussed above (Table 4). Although 0.9 % Pd/CSCNT-AC provided small HMF conversion (maximum of 39 % after 2 h), selectivity toward DHMF was very high (>99 % in up to 2 h of reaction), but it decreased a little (from >99 % to 77 %) after reaction for 3 h, producing small amounts of HMTHF (2%) and other byproducts. 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC led to high HMF conversion, which increased from 52 % after reaction for 1 h to 75 % after reaction for 2 h and remained practically constant (76 %) thereafter. This catalyst presented 86 % and 14 % selectivity toward DHMF and HMTHF, respectively, within only 1 h of reaction. After 2 h, selectivity dropped a little: 85 % of DHMF, 11 % of HMTHF, and about 4% of byproducts. After 3 h of reaction, selectivity toward DHMF decreased to 60 %, and 10 % of HMTHF and more byproducts emerged. These results showed that long reaction times diminished Pd/CSCNT-AC selectivity. This probably happened because the initially formed DHMF underwent further hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis between 2 and 3 h, generating other byproducts that negatively affected the catalyst. Indeed, the presence of BHMTHF was not detected. 3.7 Pd/CSCNT-AC catalyst reusability in HMF hydrogenation In a heterogeneous catalytic process, catalyst stability is particularly important. We did not test the reusability tests of Pd/G and Pd/AC, but we investigated the 2% Pd/CSCNT-AC stability after several recycling HMF hydrogenation experiments at 110 °C and hydrogen pressure of 3.4 MPa for 2 h. After each reaction, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and washed with deionized water. Then, the recovered catalyst was reduced under hydrogen pressure at 110 °C before the following cycle was initiated. As indicated in Table 5 , the recycled catalyst exhibited consistent performance over five cycles. Compared to the fresh catalyst, the recycled catalyst exhibited good stability for HMF hydrogenation under the assessed conditions and was reused at least five times without the catalytic activity dropping significantly. 2% Pd/CSCNT-AC also had satisfactory selectivity: selectivity did not vary significantly on going from one catalytic cycle to the next, and 83–85 % and 10–11 % DHMF and HMTHF were formed, respectively, in addition to 4–6 % of other byproducts (Table 5). We speculate that the increase in Pd4+ might be associated with decomposition of water molecules. A theoretical study about water adsorption on Pd surface suggested the formation of OH and O, co-adsorbed on the Pd surface, corroborating previous experimental studies [44]. The catalyst recycling results confirmed the data obtained in our previous studies, which had already shown that Pd/CSCNT-AC remains both catalytically active and selective after several consecutive hydrogenation reactions [38]. To sum up, furfural hydrogenation heavily depends on the hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of the substrate into which the Pd nanoparticles are incorporated. In the studied hydrogenation conditions, predominance of the Pd0 state gives a more active catalyst. When the performances of hydrophobic Pd/G and hydrophilic Pd/AC (Table 1) are compared, the Pd nanoparticles incorporated into hydrophobic G are more selective toward THFA during furfural hydrogenation and provide better furfural conversion than the Pd nanoparticles incorporated into hydrophilic AC. As for Pd/CSCNT-AC, Pd nanoparticles exist in the presence of both hydrophilic AC and hydrophobic CSCNTs, which accounts for selectivity toward THFA formation from furfural. With respect to HMF hydrogenation, selectivity toward DHMF formation and HMF conversion evidences the importance of having Pd nanoparticles incorporated into a substrate that contains hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Pd nanoparticles incorporated into hydrophobic G provide better results than Pd nanoparticles incorporated into hydrophilic AC (Table 2). In turn, the Pd/CSCNT-AC composite arises as the catalyst with the best performance, which is enhanced with increasing temperature, while its selectivity toward DHMF remains unaltered (Table 2). Regarding the hydrogen pressure effect on HMF hydrogenation, Table 3 shows that HMF conversion increases with pressure for all kinds of catalysts, as expected, whilst the selectivity toward DHMF decreases a lot, mainly in the case of the catalyst prepared with Pd nanoparticles adsorbed onto hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrates (Table 3). With increasing pressure, hydrogen can adsorb onto the carbonaceous material surface, which in turn can affect Pd nanoparticle adsorption. When the Pd nanoparticles are not in contact with the substrate, they act in HMF conversion but decrease the reaction selectivity. CNTs are known to support the action of hydrogen more than the other carbonaceous substrates. Taking cluster analysis into account, Pd agglomeration did not seem a determinant factor for catalyst performance. In contrast, surface conditions affected the catalytic process, conversion and selectivity (in the case of furfural hydrogenation), and conversion (in the HMF hydrogenation) the most. The XPS data collected in a randomly chosen region of the particulate sample suggested that all the samples contained a mixture of Pd0/2+ before being reused, so that the Pd0 concentration in the whole mass of catalyst used for the hydrogenation tests seemed to be slightly larger for Pd/CSCNT-AC than for the other samples. Together with the micro/nanostructured architecture, combining hydrophobic CNTs with hydrophilic AC was the key strategy for HMF hydrogenation in aqueous medium. 4 Conclusions Our results on furfural hydrogenation are promising, especially in the case of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic micro/nanostructured 2.0 % Pd/CSCNT-AC catalyst, which gives 75 % furfural conversion and >99 % selectivity toward THFA formation. This indicates that the catalyst favors hydrogenation of both the furfural CO and CC double bonds more actively, which contrasts with the results achieved for hydrophobic 2.2 % Pd/G and hydrophilic 1.7 % Pd/C. The combination of hydrophobic CSCNTs with the hydrophilic AC substrate probably contributes to the difference. Pd concentration also has a role in the catalyst. Low Pd concentration probably improves Pd nanoparticle adsorption on the surface of carbonaceous materials, which might reduce Pd2+ concentration and consequently enhance selectivity toward DHMF during HMF hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/CSCNT-AC, but this subject deserves a more detail investigation. However, it is evident that the combination of two surface type has an important positive effect in the catalyst studies carried by our research team. On the other hand, the hydrophobic G surface and the hydrophilic AC surface do not influence the selectivity toward DHMF, but hydrophilic Pd/AC results in better HMF conversion than Pd/G, which suggests that water adsorption onto the catalyst surface is important. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the excellent performance of Pd/CSCNT-AC toward THFA and DHMF production is due to the hybrid hydrophobic/hydrophilic architecture of the support, which can aid the role of water in the studied reactions and increase selectivity toward carbonyl group hydrogenation. However, the interesting behavior of CSCNTs with respect to water molecules can also influence the results, which mean that CNT with another structure can yield different products.

        "dc:description": "We hydrogenated furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) in water in a reaction catalyzed by Pd nanoparticles on carbonaceous materials with different morphology and hydrophobic degree. The different Pd catalysts were prepared by dipping the carbonaceous material into a Pd0 micro-emulsion. The catalyst support affected the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural and HMF. By using micrometric active carbon (AC) combined with cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) and Pd0/2+ nanoparticles (Pd), we obtained a micro/nanostructured material designated Pd/CSCNT-AC, which performed better than the other carbonaceous materials containing similar Pd nanoparticle loading. Pd/CSCNT-AC produced tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol from furfural with excellent selectivity (>99 %). Unlike Pd on hybrophobic spheroid graphite or hydrophilic AC, Pd/CSCNT-AC hydrogenated both the CO and CC double bonds of furfural and catalyzed HMF hydrogenation at the CO double bond more selectively: between 85 % and 99 % selectivity toward 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran. We also investigated how temperature, hydrogen pressure, and reaction time affected HMF hydrogenation in water. Finally, Pd/CSCNT-AC was recycled several times without significant catalytic activity loss.",
