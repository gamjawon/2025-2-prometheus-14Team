For example, the reduction of needle-shaped iron oxides at 80 C in organic solvents leads to acicular iron-magnet pigments suitable for recording magnetic signals. The reduction of TiC14 with K [BEtsH ] gives an ether-soluble [ Ti (0) -0.5THF ]= which serves as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of titanium or zirconium sponges and related systems and as a powerful activator for heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. The use of tetraalkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates as reducing agents leads to colloidal transition metals in organic phases. These colloids may also be obtained using conventional reducing agents after first reacting the metal salts with the stabilizing tetraalkylammonium halide. Colloidal metals prepared in this way serve as sources for heterogeneous metal catalysts. Key words: hydrotriorganoborates; metal colloids; metal particles Introduction Finely divided metals and alloys are of considerable interest in industrial powder technology [ 1 ] and in catalysis [ 2 ] . Fine metallic powders are usually made by metal evaporation [3 ], electrochemical processes [4 ], or the chemical reduction of metal salts, either with naphthalene activated alkali metals [5] or with anthracene activated magnesium [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . Recently we have reported the use of hydrotriorganoborates for the reduction of transition metal salts in organic solvents under mild conditions giving X-ray amorphous nanopowders of metals in the periodic table groups 6-12 and 14 [ 8 ] . By coreduction of metal salts the corresponding binary intermetallics were obtained [8 ] . The reductive deosygenation of transition metal oxides and e.g. Fe/Ni ternary spinels using 'Corresponding author. 0304-5102/94/$07.00 1994 - Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The deoxygenation of non-noble metal oxides, however, requires the presence of additional hydrogen. We have exploited this method to transform needle shaped iron oxides into acicular iron magnet pigments [9 ] . An extension of our preparative concept led to the formation of colloidal transition metals in organic media. An ether soluble Ti (0), stabilized by complexed THF, was isolated by reducing TiCl, with K [BEt3H ] in THF [ 10 ] . A large variation of colloidal transition metals of the groups 6-11 have become accessible by treatment of suspended metal salts in THF with tetraalkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates [ 11 ] . The NR4 salts, which are formed in a high local concentration at the reduction centre, act as efficient ligands and prevent aggregation of the metal. Further studies [ 12 ] have revealed, that the stabilizing tetraalkylammonium halide may alternatively be prereacted with the metal salt and subsequently reduced with conventional inorganic or organic reagents giving stable, isolable metal colloids having a narrow particle size distribution. The object of this paper is to review the preparative potential of hydrotriorganoborates as reducing agents for the production of new nanoscale materials. Further, the application of acicular iron powders for magnetic signal recording, the use of the ether-soluble [Ti (0) 0.5THF ] x as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of metals and as a doping agent for heterogeneous catalysts and finally the catalytic properties of NR4 stabilized colloidal noble metals as liquid-phase hydrogenation catalysts is discussed. Results and discussion Finely divided metal and alloy powders from metal salts Alkali metal tetrahydroborates M [BH4 ] (M = Li, Na) in aqueous solution have widely been exploited for the reductive production of transition metal powders [ 13 ] . More recently these materials were shown to be generally X-ray amorphous [ 14 ] . However, because all of the four hydrogen atoms in the BH4 anion can take part in the reducing process, the resulting metal powders are contaminated with borides. For example, the reduction of NiC12 with Na [BH4 ] , Eqn. (1), which was introduced on an industrial scale for the deposition of Ni on various supports, gives a nickel powder containing ca. 5% boron in the form of Ni3B [ 15 ] . 10NiC12 +8NaBH4 +17NaOH+3H20 -.(3Ni3B+Ni)+5NaB(OH)4+20NaCl+17.5H2i (1) Alkaline hydrotriorganoborates M [BR3H ] [ 16 ] may formally be regarded as adducts of MH to BR, Here, in contrast, the organoboron part has no reducing properties, but exclusively functions as a compleging agent to generate very soluble metal hydrides in organic media. This allowed us to develop H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. CataL 86 (1994)129-177 131 a process for preparing boride free metal nanopowders by reducing metal salts with alkali or alkaline earth metal hydrides in organic phases [ 8 ] , [ 17 ] . The hydrides are solubilized in organic media using BR3 or BR (OR' )3-, (R, R'=alkyl or aryl; n=0, 1, 2) as complexing agents to form hydrotriorganoborates [ 16 ] of the general formula M' H,4 (BR3) a or M' H,, [ BRn (OR') 3 -n ] u (M' =alkali or alkaline earth metal, u=1, 2 ). In an analogous way organogallium compounds GaRn(OR' )3-n (n=0, 1, 2, 3) may be used as complexing agents to give the corresponding hydrotriorganogallates in organic solvents. Elements of groups 6-12 and 14 of the periodic table can be prepared as pure powders by treating their metal salts with hydrotriorganoborates or -gallates in organic solvents between - 20 C and the boiling temperature of the solvent. With the restriction that the solvent should not react with the hydrides, all types of organic media were found to be suitable for the reduction process, Eqn. (2). uMX +aM' (B%H)u THF - uMl.+uM' (BR3X)u+uu/2H2T M=metal powder; M' =alkali or alkaline earth metal; R=C1-Cs (alkyl); X=OH, OR, CN, OCN, SCN. Since the ate complexes formed by reaction of hydroxides, alkoxides, cyanides, and thiocyanates with the triorganoboron and -gallium complexing agents are very soluble in organic solvents, the pure metal powders can be isolated according to Eqn. (2) (u=1, 2) by simple filtration (Table 1). The triorganoboron complexing agent can be regenerated by treatment with acid. Thus, HCl/THF liberates 98% of the triethylborane from Na [ (BEt3) OH ] . The redox potential of sodium hydrotriethylborate in THF (supporting electrolyte: Bu4NPFg) was determined electrochemically to be - 0.77 V [ 8 ] . Depending on the particular metal involved, the reaction between the metal salt and the hydride, Eqn. (2), proceeds either as a reduction or as a metathesis. The results can be rationalized on the basis of the HSAB concept [ 18 ] . The metal ions M+ act as soft acids and compete with the moderately hard acid BR3 [ 19 ] for the soft basic hydride to form 1. If M' is a softer acid than BR3, the hydride is transferred to M+, the resulting MH then decomposes spontaneously to give metal and hydrogen, Eqn. (3 ). MX+M' (BR.H) -m-'x, (M...H...BR3) - [MH] 1 (2) +BR3 BR3 M.i+1/2H2? (3) Metal halides do not generally form stable ate complexes. In many cases, however, after the reduction, Eqn. (4), they remain dissolved in the organic phase along with the liberated BR3. This was observed particularly when using THF in the case of LiCI, Liar, LiI, and NaI. To obtain pure metal powders according to Eqn. (4) in one step, the cation in the hydride has to be chosen so that the M' halide dissolves in the solvent. If the M' halide precipitates 132 TABLE 1 H.

Tetrabutylammonium hydrotriorganoborates, which are readily accessible from ammonium halides and alkali metal hydrotriorganoborates [ 11 ] may advantageously be used for the reduction of metal halides in THF. Because the ammonium halides formed as the byproducts according to Eqn. (6) remain completely dissolved after the reaction, the precipitated metal powders can easily be isolated in pure form. H.

(4) (Table 2, No. 5), shows endothermic recrystallization of the powder be- H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 135 tween 230 C and 406 C. A second run made sure that the thermal recrystallization was complete. At 298 C a heat flow minimum is seen. For the recrystallization of the sample an enthalpy difference of dHR (Co) = 24.78 J/g was calculated. A comparison of the melt and recrystallization enthalpy values allows to draw conclusions about the crystallinity of a given sample. The melt enthalpy value dHF (Co) is 259.63 J/g [ 20 ] . Since the value of dHR (Co) was found to be only ca. 9.5% of the melt enthalpy dHF (Co) quoted, it was concluded, that the cobalt powder measured was nanocrystalline. An inspection of the line widths in the X-ray diffractograms has revealed that the obtained metal powders (Tables 1-3) are generally nanocrystalline (X-ray amorphous ). For example, in Fig. 2 the X-ray diffractogram of a cobalt powder (Table 2, No. 5) before (a) and after (b) annealing at 450 C is shown. The original sample (a) shows a very diffuse line which is typical for nanocrystalline to X-ray amorphous phases [ 21 ] . After annealing four sharp lines (b) are recorded, the strongest at a scattering angle 2O of 51.9 and a reciprocal lattice distance d of 2.04 A. Since the mean particle size of the cobalt powder (100 nm) was found by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) to be identical before and after the annealing the sharp line (b) in Fig. 2 has to be assigned to a thermal augmentation of the grains (nanocrystallites) inside the cobalt particles. Table 4 summarizes the grain sizes of selected metal powders prepared by the hydrotriorganoborate reduction method, observed by TEM (transmission electron microscopy). The particle and grain size of the different materials and the statistical size distributions obviously depend rather strongly on the different elements. Fig. 2.

In 1986 Van Wontherghem et al. reported the formation of nanoscale Xray amorphous alloy particles by coreduction of FeS04 and CoC12 (molar ratio 7:3) by an excess of K [BH4 ] in aqueous solution, Eqn. (7) [ 22 ] . From chemical analysis of the particles the formula Fe44Co19B37 was derived, and further the low saturation magnetization values of the sample before (89 J T-1 kg-1) and after annealing (166 J T-1 kg-1) indicated the presence of boron in the alloy or in a separate phase. Since all four hydrogen atoms in BH4 take part in the reduction process, Eqn. (7 ), 7.85% boron is incorporated in the Fe3oCo7o alloy which was originally targeted. FeS04+COC12 H~ Fe44Co19B37 7 3 (7) However, using hydrotriorganoborates, the simple coreduction of a mixture of different metal salts - dissolved or plainly suspended in THF - according to Eqns. (2) and (4) affords practically boron free nanocrystalline alloys of two and more metals (Table 5). Within the limits of miscibility of the particular metals, known from the phase diagrams, the atomic ratio of the metals in the alloys may be adjusted by altering the proportion of the starting materials. For example, the coreduction of FeC13 and COC12 in the molar ratio of 7:3 according to Eqn. (4) yields a boron free Fe70CO3O powder (Table 5, No. 3 ).-In the diffractogram only the diffuse strongest reflection at a scattering angle 29 of 52.5 and a reciprocal lattice distance d of 2.02 A can be discerned (Fig. 3a) . The line width reveals that weakly crystalline to amorphous phases are present in the Fe/Co powder. After annealing (2 h, 400 C) the line becomes sharper (Fig. 3b). Since electron microscopy shows the particle size to be unchanged after annealing, the sharpening of the peak indicates that the grain size within the particles was increased by the heat treatment. A comparison of the diffraOgrams of the alloy with that of a mixture of amorphous iron and cobalt powders (Fig. 4a) demonstrates, that the Fe70CO3O TABLE 5 Preparation of nanocrystalline alloys by coreduction of metal salts in THF' No. Metal salt Reducing agent Conditions Product DIF' Comments t T Metal Boron 20' Dd (h) ( C) content content ( ) (A) 1 Co (OH )2 NaBEtgH 7 65 Co: 48.3 0.25 51.7 2.05 1 single phase Ni(OH)2 Ni: 45.9 nanocrystalline , 2 FeCl$ LiH+10% BEte 6 65 Fe: 47.0 0.0 52.7 2.02 1 single phase COC1Z Co: 47.1 grain size: 1-5 mn p 3' FeC18 LiBEtsH 5 23 Fe: 54.8 0.0 52.5 2.02 single phase COCI, Co: 24.5 99.9 1.17 nanocrystalline 4 COCI, LiBEtsH 7 65 Co: 21.6 0.0 55.4 1.93 single phase Ptcl, Pt: 76.3 47.4 2.23 Co 5 RhC1a LiBEtaH 5 65 Rh: 26 5 0.04 40.2 2 24 1 single phase PtC14 Pt: 65.5 46.3 1.96 6 RhCls LiBEtaH 5 65 Rh: 33.5 0.15 42.3 2.14 single phase+ , grain size. l-4 am' i 7 PdCI2 LiBEtsH 5 65 Pd: Ira, Ir: 3 6 0.04 40.1 2.25 1 single phase V Ptcla Pt: 63.4 46.3 1.96 8' PtCI$ NaBEtgH 12 65 Pt: 50.2 0.15 40.0 2.25 single phase IrC)s Ir: 48.7 46.5 1.95 nanocrystalline 9 CUCI, LiBEteH 4 65 Cu: 49.6 0.0 30.2 2.96 CueSn6+ SnCI2 Sn: 47.6 53.5 1.80 Cu+Sn 10 FeCla LiBEt9H 1.5 23 Fe: 30.1 0.0 52.7 2.02 single phases CoClg Co: 31.4 60.8 1.77 nanocrystalline NiCl2 Ni: 30.9 77.7 1.43 100.3 1.17 'For a typical procedure see Experimental. bX-ray diffractogram, CoK irradiation, Fe-filter.

An unambiguous proof that a Fe/Co alloy had been formed as a result of the coreduction was provided by the comparison of a M6sabauer spectrum (source: 6'Co/Pt, 27 C) of a Fe64Co3e sample prepared by coreduction with the known spectrum of a sample of the same composition [23] provided by melt metallurgy (Fig. 5). In the Mossbauer spectrum of Fe64Co3e produced by coreduction of FeC13 and CoC12 (Fig. 5a) the six resonances for metallic iron can be identified. The overall splitting (i.e. the distance between the outer lines) is 36 T. The Fe6oCo4O sample made by melt metallurgy for comparison gives an identical spectrum (Fig. 5b) which confirms that iron and cobalt are in fact completely alloyed in the sample prepared by the coreduction.

The coreduction of metal salts with hydrotriorganoborates in organic solvents provides a general route for the preparation of single phase, X-ray amorphous alloys of two or more components (Table 5 ). Recently Hampden-Smith extended this method for the room temperature synthesis of Mo2C and W2C through the reduction of THF suspensions of MOC14-2THF, MOC13-3THF, and WC14 with Li [BEt3H ] [ 24 ] . Metal aO alloyOwders from metal oxides In analogy to Eqn. (2) hydrotriorganoborates in organic phases can also be used for the reduction of transition metal oxides to give practically boron free metal powders under mild conditions. The deogygenation of HgO, Pt02, Ag20, and PdO in various organic media takes place very smoothly even at moderate temperatures (Table 6, Nos.1-5) . The course of the reaction has not been elucidated yet in every detail; presumably the first step of the deosygention consists in the transformation of the metal ogo group to the corresponding metal hydroxide, which is due to subsequent reduction. This assumption is supporO by the fact, that the application of an excess of the hydrotriorga- noborates is advantageous in order to afford a clean and complete deogygenation of the metal oxides. Because the hydrosotriorganoborates formed as the byproducts readily dissolve in organic solvents, the metal powders can be isolated by simple filtration. The overall reaction is represented by Eqn. (8), which describes the deoxygenation of Pt02 (Table 6, No. 2). Pt02 +NaBEt3H (excess) 4b, 20 C, THF Ptl+NaBEt,30H (8) The reduction of less noble metal oxides, such as CuO, may be improved by additional hydrogen in the reaction mixture as can be deducted from the purity of the resulting copper powders (Table 6, Nos. 6 and 7) by comparison. In contrast, the deoxygenation of typical non-noble metal oxides by hydrotriorganoborates requires the presence of compressed hydrogen (Table 6, Nos. 8-15 ). X-ray powder diffraction measurements have revealed that the metal powders obtained by the deoxygenation of metal oxides are generally nanocrystalline. The grain size of the nickel and cobalt powders quoted in Table 6 was determined by TEM to range between 6-10 nm (Nos. 8 and 9) and 1-5 nm (Nos.10-12).

The conventional industrial process for the production of acicular iron pigments from the corresponding iron oxides or oxide-hydroxides by reduction with excess gaseous hydrogen, Eqn.

Surprisingly, under these mild reaction conditions the oxygen may be removed from the iron oxide lattice quantitatively. The pyrophoric iron pigments may be isolated from the clear organic solution by filtration. The trialkylborane acts as a complex carrier in organic solution both for the metal hydride and the resulting metal hydroxide and may be reused after hydrolysis of the triorganohydrogoborate. The regeneration amount of the carrier exceeds 97% [ 25 ] (See Experimental). Fig. 6 shows a TEM image of the a-Fe00H used as the starting material for the deosygenation reaction, Eqn. (10 ), (Table 6, No. 13 ). Well shaped small needles of ca. 350 nm length appear at a magnification of 50 000 :1. Although, relative to the starting material, upon the reaction forming the metal pigment a volume decrease by about 60% is observed, the needle shape of the a-Fe00H is retained according to the TEM findings. The product shown in Fig. 7 at the same scale consists of an acicular iron pigment of ca. 250 nm length and a diameter of ca. 20 nm, and does not exhibit any sintering. The acicular iron pigments prepared according to Eqns. (10) and (11) were found to have superior magnetic properties. The crucial characteristics Fig. 6. TEM image of a-Fe00H (Table 6, No. 13). H.

TEM image of Fe (Table 6, No.13 ). 143 of magnetic materials for recording purposes are saturation magnetization Ms, remanence MR, and coercive field strength HC. In practice an adjustment of certain coercive force ranges HC of the magnet pigment to be used is desirable. Whereas the magnetic properties of iron pigments from the high temperature gas phase reduction process, Eqn. (9), can be varied only via the particle size and shape of the iron oxide starting compounds, the low temperature deogygenation according to Eqns. (10) and (11) allows to prepare acicular iron pigments which exhibit high values of the saturation magnetization Ms and remanence MR along with a coercive force value which can be adjusted for the special sector of application simply by thermal after-treatment without causing undesirable sintering of the metal needles. An inspection of Table 7 shows, that the HC-value of the iron pigment quoted in Table 6, No. 13 may be increased from 82 kA/m in the initial product to > 100 kA/m by thermal treatment at > 200 C in hydrogen or argon atmosphere or in vacuo. Probably this is a consequence of an augmentation of the grains (nanocrystals) present in the acicular particles during the annealing.

(12) . The advantage of this variation is that the ratio of the metals in the resulting alloys can be adjusted by varying the ratio of the metal oxides in the starting materials. X-ray diffractometry has confirmed the presence of metal alloys in the products and excluded the contamination by non-alloyed metals in their elemental form (See Table 8) . (12) Formation of colloidal transition metals and alloys in organic solvents Because of their potential in catalysis, colloidal mono- and bimetallic materials have, after a period of hibernation, recently attracted more attention, notably through the contributions of Bradley [ 27 ] , Esumi [ 28 ] , Klabunde [ 29 ] , Lewis [ 30 ] , Moiseev [ 31 ] , Schmid [ 32 ] , and Toshima [ 33 ] . In the course of our investigations we have developed a new method for the preparation of stable and very soluble metal colloids in organic phases having a narrow particle size distribution. The metal cores derived from elements of the periodic table groups 6-11 are protected by tetraalkylammonium halides [ 11 ] . However, in the case of Ti (0 ), the metal stabilization was achieved by the solvent THF and an ether soluble compound [ Ti ( 0 ) 0.5THF ] x has been isolated [ 10 ] . Various colloids of this new type have been used to prepare active liquid phase hydrogenation catalysts [ 34 ] . H. BonneOnn et al. / J. Mol.

After vacuum evaporation of the solvent and BEt3 (identified by 11B-NMR spectroscopy) a black residue is obtained which is extracted with THF. This THF solution is treated with pentane to give a brown black precipitate 2 (Eqn. 13) . After thorough drying in vacuo the pyrophoric powder 3 is obtained along with small amounts of KCl (identified by X-ray diffraction). Quantitative measurements of the gas evolved during the reduction (1 mol H2 per mol Ti), protonolysis of 2 and cross experiments using K [BEt3D ] as the reducing agent in Eqn. (13) show that 2 still has various amounts of residual hydrogen. The hydrogen in 2 is removed in vacuo to give 3, Eqn.

Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 147 Besides the application of 2 or 3 as dopant for noble metal hydrogenation catalysts (vide infra ), the colloidal [Ti (0) 0.5THF ] x has been found to be a very efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of titanium and zirconium sponges as well as for a nickel hydride battery alloy. The uncatalyzed hydrogenation of titanium or zirconium sponges using compressed hydrogen affords pressures above 100 bar and minimum reaction temperatures of 150 C. The hydrogenation of these metals under such drastic conditions, however, is associated with unwanted sintering of the materials so that the products can only be used after additional grinding. After the addition of 1 % Ti (present in 3) to the metal sponges a smooth hydrogenation of titanium and zirconium is observed at low temperatures (60 -90 C) . The reaction may be carried out in THF solution, toluene suspension or in the dry state after depositing the catalyst on the Surface of the samples by evaporation of the solvent in vacuo. Using a special device [ 35 ] , the mass specific uptake of hydrogen depending on pressure, temperature and time was monitored automatically. Fig. 9 shows the typical course of the hydrogen uptake during the hydrogenation of a titanium sponge at 60 C catalyzed by 1% Ti in the form of 3. After a certain latent period with only negligible uptake of H2 an abrupt start of the catalytic hydrogenation occurs; followed by a period of rather constant HZ uptake (denoted as the hydrogenation period). Towards the end of the HZ uptake the reaction turns into a slow decay. An inspection of Fig.10 shows, that the mass specific hydrogenation time [min/g] detected for 1 g of titanium sponge at 100 bar H2 in the presence of the catalyst is constant between 60 and 90 C, practically constant in THF and toluene and even in the absence of a solvent. Significant differences, however, occur with regard to the latent period.

In case of the Ti ( 0 ) -catalyzed hydrogenation of zirconium sponge at 60 C in THF no latent period was observed. A welcome benefit of the Ti ( 0 ) -catalyzed hydrogenation process is that H. BonneOnn et al. / J. Mob. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 149 the compact titanium and zirconium sponges break down during the HZ uptake forming finely divided hydride powders. Fig. 11 shows the SEM image of a sample of ZrH2 produced by catalytic hydrogenation of a zirconium sponge. The resulting 20 m powder has a very uniform size distribution. X-ray diffraction of the products has provided an unambiguous identification of TiH2 and ZrH2. Protonolysis of the dry hydrides with 5 M HCl liberates 98% of the theoretically expected amount of H2. An interesting application of the Ti(0)-catalyzed metal hydrogenation process is the pressureless hydrogenation of a Ni/Zr/V/Ti/Cr alloy at room temperature. The corresponding hydride of this special alloy (Ni 38.2%, Zr 24.3%, Ti 12.8%, V 18.7%, Cr 6.0%) is of current interest for electrochemical purposes (nickel hydride battery). However, the hydrogenation at room temperature affords 5 bar hydrogen pressure and even under these conditions an unwanted latent period occurs. After doping the surface of the alloy with 1 wt. % of soluble Ti (0) using 3 as the precursor, a spontaneous uptake of 0.60.7 wt. % hydrogen is observed at room temperature without applying pressure. Colloidal transition metals and alloys protected by tetraalkylammonium halides via reduction of metal salts with tetraalkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates Based on the originally puzzling observation, that the reduction of noble metal chlorides, e.g. PtC12, with NBu4 [BEt3H ] in THF besides giving the expected metal powders (Eqn. 6, Table 3) led to dark red solutions containing colloidal metals in THF, we were able to develop a general method for the preparation of metal colloids of elements of the groups 6-11 in the organic phase [ 11 ] , [ 17 ] . The THF suspensions of the metal salts are treated with tetraalkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates, having alkyl groups preferentially of the chain lengths Cs-C2o. H2 evolution occurs and brown-red metal colloid solutions are generated, from which only a small proportion of the reduced metal precipitates, Eqn. (14) . MX + vNR 84 (BEt3 H) ~ M,,olloid + vNR4 X + vBEt3 + v/2H2 T (14 ) M=metal of groups 6-11, X=Cl, Br, v=1, 2, 3, R=alkyl, Cs-CZO. The long-chain tetraalkylammonium salts formed directly at the reduction centre in high local concentration act as very effective protecting agents to keep the particles of freshly reduced metal in solution (entropic stabilization factor) . The filtered metal colloid solutions in THF resulting from Eqn. (14 ) are stable for months without any metal precipitation. In many cases the metal colloids have been isolated from the solution in the form of redispersible powders. The THF solutions are evaporated to dryness under high vacuum, the waxy residues are dissolved in ether, toluene or ethanol, and the metal colloid precipitated by addition of a third solvent (for details of the workup see Table 9 and Experimental).

Elemental analysis of the colloid powders and mass spectrometry indicate, that NR4X is present. Presumably, the negatively charged metal core of the colloid is protected against agglomeration by the surrounding tetraalkylammonium ions (Fig. 12 ). This screening of the metal particles by large lipophilic alkyl groups explains the remarkable solubility of the colloids in organic solvents and their extraordinary stability. The isolated metal colloids were examined by TEM. An inspection of the mean particle sizes quoted in Table 9 indicates that the metals form relatively small metal aggregates. In general the colloids prepared according to Eqn. (14 ) exhibit a narrow size distribution. Fig. 13 shows a typical particle size distribution determined from a TEM image of the Ir colloid (Table 9, No. 7) . HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscopy) of the Ir colloid (Table 9, No. 7) has further revealed, that surprisingly these small metal particles are crystalline (See the fringes in Fig. 14) . By coreduction of two different metal salts in analogy to Eqn. (14) the bimetallic colloids quoted in Table 10 have been prepared and isolated as redispersible powders. TEM images of the coreduction products show colloids with a narrow size distribution. Whether these bimetallic colloids (Table 10) are true colloidal metal alloys is under current investigation by the combination of X-ray diffraction, XPS, EXAFS, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies. Fig. 15 shows the HRTEM image of the Pt/Rh coreduction product (Table 10, No. 1) . Metal particles of 2.3 nm size can be identified, showing net plane distances of 0.25 nm in the crystal.

HRTEM image of colloidal Pt/Rh alloy (Table 10, No.1). 155 General approach to NR4 -stabilized metal colloids using conventional re ducing agents [ 12 ] In the synthesis, Eqn. (14 ), of colloidal transition metals discussed above, the stabilization of the metal particles was achieved by combining the stabilizing agent (NR4 ) with the reducing agent (NR4 [BEt3H ]) in order to generate a high local concentration of stabilizing agent at the reduction centre (Entropic stabilization factor). A further development of this method led to NR4 stabilized (isolable) metals of groups 6-11 by coupling the stabilizing agent to the metal salt which is to be reduced and reducing with simple inorganic and organic reducing agents (Eqn. 15 ). (NR4) w MX Y,,, + vRed--> Mcovoid + vRedX + wNR4 Y (15 ) M: Metal of groups 6-11, Red: H2, HCOOH, BEt3, K, Zn, LiH, LiBEt3H, NaBEt3H, KBEt3H X, Y=Cl, Br, I, v, w=1-3; R=Cs-C12. According to Eqn. (15) the disadvantage inherent in the use of a special reducing agent and the compulsory need of stoichiometric amounts of stabilizing agent in the original synthesis, Eqn. (14 ), may be avoided. The idea of coupling the stabilizing agent to the metal centre is exemplified for palladium: On the addition of octyl4NBr or dodecy14NBr to a solution of Pd(ac )2 in THF a strong colour intensification is observed which indicates the desired interaction between the Pd salt and the stabilizing agent. The NR4 stabilized Pd colloid may now be obtained by simply bubbling hydrogen through the solution 156 H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 at room temperature. The optimal ratio of stabilizing agent to palladium is 1:2, which means that in comparison with the reduction using octyl4NBEt3H only about a quarter of the stabilizing agent is applied. This decrease in the amount of stabilizing agent facilitates the workup considerably. Reduction of the NR4 stabilized Pd (ac) 2 with hydrogen, formic acid, triethylborane or by thermal decomposition leads to stable palladium organo sols. By XPS examination of the Pd colloid quoted No. 9 in Table 11 the binding energies for the Pd 3ds/2 and Pd 3da/2 electrons were found to be 334.3 eV and 339.3 eV respectively. Since the values theoretically expected for zero-valent Pd are 334.9 eV and 340.1 eV this result confirms that colloidal Pd(0) was produced in the reduction. Using the simplified preparation method, Eqn. (15 ), various noble and non-noble metal colloids have been obtained, which can be isolated in the form of redispersible powders by addition of protic solvents such as water or ethanol to the organic solution (Table 11) . The mean particle size of the resulting colloids analyzed by TEM ranges from 0.5 nm in case of Ru (Table 11, No. 4) to a maximum of 4 nm found for palladium (Table 11, No. 13). The stabilizing agent (e.g. octyl4NBr) can also be attached to the metal in the form of a defined tetraalkylammonium metalate. Esumi [28], Blum and others [36] have introduced solvent-solvent extractions using tetraalkylammonium salts to transfer noble metal halides from aqueous HCl into organic solvents. We, however, dissolve e.g. palladium, platinum, and nickel halides in THF simply by heating with tetraalkylammonium halides (Eqn. (16) ). is \"a- (NOcty1)2PCX2 Y2 PdX2+2NOcty14Y T (16) For the success of the reductive colloid synthesis from the corresponding metalates, Eqn. (16) the choice of an appropriate anion is important: The reduction of (octyl4N)2PdC14 with hydrogen gives a metallic precipitate and (octyl4N) 2PdBr4 is not reduced even under 50 bar hydrogen atmosphere. From (octyl4N)2PdC12Br2, however, a palladium colloid showing a narrow size distribution [ 12 ] was obtained (Table 11, No. 13) . The preparation of bimetallic colloids by coreduction of different metal salts according to this concept is also successful. Currently we are continuing to investigate this promising subject. Nanoscale metal powders via metal colloids The fact that neither halogen nor nitrogen could be detected in the EDX spectra of the colloid particles under UHV (ultra high vacuum) conditions in the electron microscope column or by XPS at ca. 150 C and 10-' to 10-8 Pa clearly indicates that the protecting teraalkylammonium halide may be removed under certain conditions leaving the bare metal core behind. This observation prompted us to develop a chemical procedure for the careful extraction of the protecting shell at room temperature in order to produce nanoscale H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol.

This is exemplified with nanoscale platinum powder prepared from the corresponding platinum colloid (Table 9, No. 12 ): In order to extract the stabilizing tetraalkylammon ium halide the grey-brown colloid powder is treated with excess ethanol. The supernatant solution of the tetraalkylammonium halide is siphoned and sub sequently the colour of the product darkens. After several repetitions a pyro phoric metal powder (93% Pt) is obtained which is no longer redispersible in THF (Table 12, No. 5). The TEM image of this product (Fig. 16) shows that the mean particle size of the platinum powder found after the extraction cor responds exactly to the particle size of the colloidal platinum which was used as the starting material. However, small residues of the protecting shell are still present in the sample. Interestingly, this contaminations can be com pletely removed by an after-treatment of the metal powder at 700 7000C and 0.1 Pa. An inspection of the TEM image of the product (Fig. 17) proves, that the original particle size of the colloidal platinum (2.8 nm) was conserved and no unwanted agglomeration of the nanoparticles is observed as a consequence of the heat treatment. This finding has successfully been exploited for the preparation of various nanoscale metal and alloy powders via metal colloids (Table 12 ). According to TEM as a rule the particle size of the metal and alloy powders obtained corresponds to the size found in the colloidal starting material. The only exception was found so far with palladium, where the removal of the protecting shell caused an augmentation of the particles from 2.5 nm to 6.0 nm. After the heat treatment, however, the size of the palladium nanoparticles remained unchanged. Catalytic applications Metal colloids may be useful as homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. In the homogeneous phase the activities of different palladium colloids were determined by the hydrogenation of cyclohegene in THF under standard conditions [ 12 ] (See Experimental). The adsorption of the noble metal colloids on charcoal gave standard samples of heterogeneous catalysts covered with 5% Pd [12], 5% Rh [34] or 5% Pt which were tested in the hydrogenation of cinnamic acid, butyronitrile or crotonic acid respectively. These standard substrates are routinely applied for commercial industrial catalysts (See Experimental). Fig. 18 shows the set-up used for determining the maximal catalyst activity. As the highest activity is found at the start of the reaction, this apparatus was used for short time tests. The central element is a thermostatically controlled standard test reactor which is directly compatible with an industrial testing apparatus used for catalyst quality control. The agitated vessel reactor is evacuated to a residue pressure of 10 Pa via the vacuum pump (c) and then backfilled with hydrogen. The catalyst is flushed into the reactor using solvent from the reservoir (d). The substrate is introduced by injection through a septum (e) initiating the reaction. The reaction mixture H.

TEM image of Pt powder obtained from Pt colloid (Table 12, No. 5 ). is agitated using a self aspirating hollow stirrer (f) to achieve an intimate mixture between the suspension and the gas phase. During the catalysis the hydrogen supply is provided by one of the two gas burettes (g, h). The 900 ml burette is connected to a 2 channel recorder (j) via a displacement-voltage recorder (i) . This registers the amount of hydrogen consumed and the reaction temperature at the thermocouple (k) and the digital thermometer (1) . Based on the hydrogen consumption in the first five minutes, the activity of the catalyst is calculated in terms of [ N ml/ (g min) ] . In order to investigate the selectivity, a sample is taken at the end of the experiment and the reaction products are identified by GC. Besides activity, the stability (lifetime) of the catalyst is of particular interest. This is tested in a second reactor unit. With respect to the experimental set up described in Fig. 18, the main difference here concerns the hydrogen supply. Since a greater amount of gas is needed H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 161 Fig.17. TEM image of Pt powder obtained from Pt colloid (Table 12, No. 5) after thermal treatment (4h, 700 C, 0.1 Pa). during the stability test, additional hydrogen is supplied automatically from a 200 ml stainless steel autoclave through a reducing pressure valve. The pressure drop in the autoclave, registered on a 2 channel recorder, is proportional to the amount of hydrogen consumed. Free and supported metal colloid catalysts in liquid phase hydrogenation The free nickel and palladium colloids are suitable for the selective hydrogenation of naturally occurring products such as soya bean oil. Table 13 summarizes the activities of various palladium colloids in the homogeneous cyclohexene hydrogenation. An inspection of Table 13 reveals that neither the method used for the preparation (Eqn.14 or 15) nor the particle size of the colloid has a systematic 162 H. Bonnemann et ad. / J. Mol.

Surprisingly, the choice of the anion is found to be important. In the order of Br > Cl > ac > I a strong decrease in the catalytic activity of the colloidal palladium in the cyclohexene test was observed A major disadvantage of the free colloids, however, lies in the tendency of non-supported hydrogenation catalysts to agglomerate very easily in solution which causes metal precipitation and consequently prompts a drastic loss of activity. In the case of the free colloidal palladium catalysts the first metal precipitation already occurs after 6-7 minutes. Adsorption of the metal colloids onto technically important supports such as charcoal improves the stability of the resulting catalysts substantially. In contrast to a widespread prejudice it was found that the catalytic activity is not deteriorated automatically when the metal particles are supported: Table 14 compares the activity values measured with free colloidal palladium and supported on charcoal (5% H.

Both in the cyclohegene test (Table 14, Nos.1 and 2) and in the cinnamic acid test (Table 14, Nos. 3 and 4) only minor differences in the catalytic activity of the free and supported palladium colloid were found. (Because the free palladium colloid is insoluble in ethanol the cinnamic acid test had to be performed in THF for comparison. For the standard activity of 5% Pd/C in ethanol see Table 15, No. 2) . These findings were confirmed by a comparison of the mean particle size in the TEM images of the palladium colloid (Table 11, No.13) in the free and supported form used in the catalytic test reactions quoted in Table 14. The free colloid is shown in Fig.19 (left side ). As shown in Fig.19 (right side) the mean particle size of the O precursor (4.0 nm) remains virtually unchanged by the adsorption process; the dispersion of the palladium colloid on the charcoal appears to be remarkably uniform. This effect is probably due to the fact that the discrete particles in the free colloid (Fig. 19, left) are well separated from each other by the long chain hydrocarbon groups present in the tetraalkylammonium protecting shell. As a consequence, an unwanted agglomeration of the 164 H. B6nnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 Fig. 19. TEM image of Pd Colloid (Table 11, No. 13) (left) free, and (right) supported on charcoal. metal cores on the support surface is prevented. The conservation of the particle size of the metal colloids after the adsorption was further checked by analogous TEM images of free and supported colloidal rhodium [ 34 ] . The activities (cinnamic acid test) of supported Pd/C catalysts (Table 15, Nos. 2, 5, 6, 7) prepared on the basis of the colloids quoted in Table 9, No. 10 and Table 11, Nos. 10,11, and 12 are comparable to the industrial catalyst (Table 15, No. 1). Substantially higher activities are observed in case of the Pd/C catalysts (Table 15, Nos. 3 and 4) prepared from the colloids in Table 11, Nos. 9 and 13. In case of the supported colloid (Table 15, No. 3) the activity was enhanced by a factor of 2.3 in comparison to the conventional catalyst (Table 15, No. 1). The activities of colloidal platinum catalysts (5% supported on charcoal) in the crotonic acid test are compared in Table 16 with a conventional 5% Pt/ C catalyst prepared by the precipitation method. The Pt/C catalyst No. 3 prepared from the isolated platinum colloid (Table 11, No. 14) exceeds the activity of the conventional catalyst. As can be seen by comparison (Table 16, Nos. 2 and 3 ), the crude platinum colloid solution can be adsorbed directly from the reaction batch on charcoal without affecting the activity of the resulting catalyst. A TEM image of the industrial Rh/C catalyst (Table 16, No. 5), conventionally prepared by precipitation of aqueous RhC13 on charcoal, has re- H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol.

In contrast, the adsorption of the pre-prepared rhodium colloid (Table 9, No. 6) on charcoal was shown to yield a remarkably uniform metal dispersion on the charcoal with full conservation of the particle size found in the colloidal precursor [ 34 ] . Consequently the activity in the butyronitrile test of the conventional Rh/C catalyst is surpassed by 33% by the rhodium colloid supported on charcoal (Table 16, Nos. 5 and 6). For reasons of comparison both the conventional Rh/C catalysts and the rhodium colloid/C systems were prepared under argon. In order to obtain air stable products, we have treated the ready-made dry catalysts carefully for 2 h with argon that contained 0.2 vol% molecular oxygen [34]. We were surprised to find that the careful oxygenation of the surface not only stabilizes both types of catalysts to air, but also considerably enhances their activity. In the case of the conventional Rh/C catalyst the oxygenation step improves the activity by 17% (Table 17, Nos. 1 and 2). The more active rhodium colloid/C catalyst (Table 17, No. 4) approximately doubles its activity after oxygenation (Table 17, No. 6) . These findings are in good correspondence with a report published by Willstatter as early as 1921 [ 37 ] , concluding that the activity of noble-metal hydrogenation catalysts is strongly oxygen dependent. Using Ti02 as a carrier for noble metal hydrogenation catalysts, most effective strong metal support interactions (SMSI) have been reported [ 38 ] [ 39 ] . Ryndin et. al. [ 40 ] systematically investigated the effect of early transition metal ions as dopants for noble metal hydrogenation catalysts on neutral supports such as silica or graphite. The tetravalent titanium, zirconium, and hafnium ions were reduced on the support by thermal after-treatment under hydrogen. However, using zero-valent titanium in the form of bis (arene) Ti (0 ) compounds or [ Ti (0) - 0.5THF ] x as dopants at room temperature without further thermal treatment or hydrogenolysis, we have observed that the catalytic iO a2 10 x .O U 0 b~ O a b 0 x .s o U '0 O aU a o V U a~ x a 0 o W O a 10 r b r.

A comparison of the activity figures quoted in Table 17 shows that doping of the supported rhodium colloid catalyst with 0.2% Ti (0) is most effective in combination with subsequent oxygenation. The long-time stability of conventional and colloidal noble metal catalysts on charcoal was tested by measuring the total turnover number of the systems in the hydrogenation of cyclooctene in ethanol at 40 C. This is exemplified in Fig. 20 for the industrial Pd/C catalyst (Table 15, No. 1) and the supported palladium colloid catalyst (Table 15, No. 3). Whereas the activity of the conventional precipitation catalyst expires completely after the performance of 38 X 103 catalytic cycles per palladium atom, the colloidal Pd/C catalyst still shows a residual activity of 30 N ml HZ/ (g min) after 96 X 103 catalytic turnovers. However, the superiority of the colloidal system over the conventional catalyst observed for palladium in this case cannot be generalized. The hydrogenation activity of the supported bimetallic Pt/Rh colloid (c Table 10, No.1) (5% metal on C) was investigated using the crotonic acid test. In order to elucidate the cocatalytic influence of rhodium, the activity of the bimetallic systems was plotted against increasing amounts of rhodium present in various Pt/Rh colloids adsorbed on charcoal (Fig. 21, curve 1). For comparison, samples of platinum colloid (Table 9, No.12) were mixed in solution with increasing amounts of rhodium colloid (Table 9, No. 6) and then adsorbed at charcoal (5% metal) . The activities of the resulting catalysts in the crotonic acid test were plotted against the Pt/Rh ratio in Fig. 21, curve 2. Further, samples of the ready-made Pt/C catalyst (Table 16, No. 2) were thoroughly mixed with increasing amounts of the corresponding Rh/C catalyst (Table 16, No. 6 ); the resulting activity values, plotted against the Pt/Rh ratio are shown in Fig. 21, curve 3.

This obviously accounts for a synergistic effect of the two metals in the bimetallic colloid at certain atomic ratios which may be interpreted as a further indication that a Pt/Rh alloy colloid was present in the precursors formed by coreduction (cf. Table 10, No. 1 and Fig. 15). Conclusions The results presented here establish that metals and metal alloys of 10100 nm particle size are easily accessible through the chemical reduction of metal salts or metal oxides with of hydrotriorganoboratea. Transition metal colloids (1-10 nm ) , including bimetallic colloids, stabilized by NR4X may be prepared similarly. These materials are of special interest with respect to alloy formation and segregation processes. Furthermore, they have been shown to be active catalysts both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phase. The noble metal colloids may be deposited on surfaces with an unusually high degree of dispersion. The pretreatment of the support with low-valent titanium considerably enhances the catalytic activity in liquid-phase hydrogenations. Bimetallic Pt/Rh colloid catalysts show a higher activity compared with a combination of the individual metals. These observations, together with the structural characterization of the particles by physical methods, open promising perspectives for catalyst design. H. B6nnemann et al. / J. Mol.

X-ray diffractogram: (measured with CoKa radiation, Fe filter); strongest reflection 29: 52.7 ; lattice spacing of planes, d: 2.02 A. Preparation of a palladium platinum alloy from PdCl2, PtCl2 and Li(BEt3HJ A solution of 5.3 g (50 mmol) of Li [ BEt3 H ] dissolved in 50 ml of THF was added dropwise with stirring to a refluged suspension of 1.77 g (10 mmol ) of PdCl~ and 2.66 g (10 mmol) of PtC12 in 250 ml of THF in a 500 ml flask. After 5 h the mixture was allowed to cool to 23 C, and the alloy powder filtered off and washed with 250 ml aliquots of THF, ethanol, THF, and pentane successively. The yield of alloy powder after drying under high vacuum (0.1 Pa) was 3.02 g. Metal content: Pd 33.6%; Pt 63.4%; boron content: 0.04%. X-ray diffractogram (measured with CoKa radiation, Fe filter): strongest reflections 29: 40.1 (46.3 ); lattice spacing of planes, d: 2.25 A (1.96 A). Preparation of platinum powder from PtCl2 and Na fBEt3HJ in THF A solution of 6.71 g (55 mmol) of Na [BEt3H ] dissolved in THF (1 molar) was added dropwise at 23 C with stirring to a suspension of 2.5 g (10.9 mmol ) of PtCl2 in 100 ml of THF in a 250 ml flask. The clear reaction solution was separated from the platinum powder after 2 h, and the latter was washed with 100 ml aliquots of THF, ethanol, THF, and pentane successively. The yield of metal powder after drying under high vacuum (0.1 Pa), was 2.05 g. Preparation of metal and alloy powders from metal oxides Preparation of iron pigment from Fe00H, Na[BEt3HJ and H2 in toluene (cf. Figs. 6 and 7) In a 51 autoclave equipped with a stirrer, 96 g (1.078 mol) of Fe00H under a protective gas was admixed with 1.221 of a 2.67 M solution of Na [BEt,3H ] in toluene and filled up with toluene to a working volume of 3.01. HZ was added at room temperature to a pressure of 100 bar, and the stirred mixture was heated at 80 C for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the HZ was released, and the black reaction mixture discharged. The clear supernatant solution was separated from the iron pigment, and the iron was washed with 1.5 1 of THF. The residue was stirred with 1.51 of THF and 0.41 of ethanol until the gas evolution had ceased and was then washed again with 1.5 1 of THF. After drying under high vacuum (0.1 Pa) 63.7 g of acicular iron pigment was H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 171 obtained: Fe( ) 81.6%, Few 87.87%; Ms=193.0 mT cm3/g, MR=101.3 mT cm3/g, Hc=82.2 kA/m. Regeneration of the carrier triethylOrane The clear reaction solution separated from the acicular iron pigment, while stirred, was admixed dropwise under a protective gas with distilled water, until gas evolution was no longer observed (about 4 to 5 ml). Then 175.8 g (632.4 mmol) of solid FeS04-7H20 was added. After 1 to 2 h of stirring, the bright brown solid was filtered off and subsequently washed with portions of THF. The clear filtrate (1130.5 g), according to the 11B-NMR signal (86.24 ppm) and analytical gas chromatography, contains 7.17% (81.1 g=827.5 mmol) of pure triethylborane. Thus, 98.1% of the carrier triethylborane, based on the carrier complex employed as the starting material, was recovered. Preparation of iron nickel alloy from FexlVi04 and NafEt3HJ in toluene In a 250 ml autoclave equipped with a stirrer, 2.33 g (10 mmol) of Fe2Ni04 and 60 ml of toluene was admixed with 75 ml of a 1.61 M Na [BEt3H ] solution (120 mmol) in toluene and heated under H2 pressure (100 bar) at 130 C for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the HZ was released, and a black reaction mixture discharged. The alloy powder was separated from the supernatant clear solution and washed with 200 ml of THF. Then the mixture was stirred with 100 ml of THF and 100 ml of ethanol was added until the gas evolution has ceased and washed twice with 200 ml aliquots of THF successively. The yield of alloy powder after 2 h of drying under high vacuum (0.1 Pa) was 1.55 g. Metal content: Fe 63.67% ; Ni 28.99% . X-ray diffractogram (measured with CoKa radiation and Fe filter): strongest reflection 29: 52.3 ; lattice spacing of planes, d: 2.03 A. Colloidal transition metals and alloys The preparation of [ Ti (0) - 0.5THF ] x has been published elsewhere [ 10 ] . Hydrogenation of Ti sponge using colloidal Ti(0) 3 (cf. Figs. 9 and 10) A solution of 367 mg (3.0 mmol =1 wt. %) [ Ti (O) 0.5THF ] x in 150 ml of THF was added to 13.48 g Ti sponge and introduced into an autoclave. H2 was introduced to a pressure of 100 bar and the reserve cylinder was filled to 150 bar H2. Within the first 3 h a minimal uptake of H2 was observed (latent period). After 21 h the H2 uptake was completed and the H2 in the autoclave was slowly released. The reaction mixture was discharged under protective gas. The black solution above the TiH2 powder was siphoned off and the powder was dried for 16 h in vacuum (oil pump). The powder was identified as TiH2 by X-ray diffraction by comparison with an authentic sample. Elemental analysis: calc.: H 4.0%; found H 4.0%; particle size, screening analysis:10.53 g (78%) < 0.2 mm, 2.84 g (21 %) > 0.2 mm; SEM: 3.40 O. Protonolysis with 5 M HCI: A solution of 0.133 g of TiH2 (powder < 0.2 172 H. BonneOnn et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 mm) was stirred and heated with 20 ml of 5 M HCl saturated with HZ until dissolution was complete. The evolved H2 was collected in a gas burette. Determination 1: 146 N ml (97% ); Determination 2:0.127 x,141 N ml (99% ). Hydrogenation of Zr sponge using colloidal n(0) 3 (cf. Figs. 10 and 11) A solution of 464 mg (3.3 = mmol 1 wt. %) Ti (O) - 0.5THFx in 150 ml of THF was added to 30.09 g (330 mmol) Zr sponge and introduced into an autoclave which was thermostated under stirring to 90 C. After adding H2 to a pressure of 100 bar, the hydrogenation process started spontaneously and stopped after several minutes. After 40 h at 90 C and 100 bar HZ pressure, the autoclave was cooled down and slowly released. The reaction mixture was discharged under protective gas. The black solution above the ZrH2 powder was siphoned off and the powder dried under vacuum (oil pump) over 16 h. Elemental analysis: calc.: H 1.9%, found: H 1.7%; particle size, screening analysis: 4.02 g (13%) < 0.2 mm, 25.82 g (86%) > 0.2 mm; SEM: 2-20 ,tm. Hydrogenation of a hydride battery alloy using colloidal Ti(0) 3 A 5.63 g quantity of a hydride battery alloy ( Ni 38.2 % , Zr 24.3 %, Ti 12.8% , V 18.7%, Cr 6.0%, H2 0.1%) was treated with a solution of 140 mg [Ti (O) -0.5 THF]x (Ti 40.6%) in 50 ml of THF. The solution was removed under reduced pressure and the doped alloy dried in vacuum over 2 h. The evacuated flask containing the alloy was then connected to a gas burette filled with H2. After filling the flask with H2, hydrogenation started spontaneously as indicated by a jump in the sample temperature. The H2 uptake was monitored with a gas burette over 16 h. The hydrogenated alloy contained 0.7 wt.% of H2. NR4 protected colloidal metals and alloys via reducing with tetrOlkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates: preparation of iridium colloid (cf. Figs. 13aO 14) A solution of N (C8H17) 4 [ BEt3H ] in THF (50 ml, 0.37 M) was added within 1 h at room temperature to a stirred suspension of anhydrous IrC13 (1.84 g, 6.16 mmol) in 200 ml of THF. Almost complete dissolution of the IrC13 occurred after 16 h at 60 C. After filtration the clear, dark black-brown solution was concentrated in vacuo, and the black-brown, waxy residue was dried for 3 h at room temperature and 0.1 Pa. The product (7.38 g) was soluble in THF, ether, toluene and acetone, but insoluble in ethanol, and contained 10.85% Ir. The residue was suspended in 200 ml technical quality ethanol without protective gas and addition of 20 ml technical quality ether caused a grey-black precipitate to form. It was left to stand for 1 h, before removing the clear supernatant solution by inert gas pressure (Argon) on the liquid surface. The precipitate was washed once with a mixture of 40 ml ethanol/4 ml ether. Drying in vacuum (0.1 Pa, 1 h, room temperature) yielded a grey iridium colloid powder (0.36 g), which was very soluble in THF, soluble in acetone and insoluble H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 173 in ether, ethanol and toluene. Elemental analysis: Ir 65.55%, N 0.27%, C 19.97%, H 3.49%; mean particle size: 1.5 nm. NB4 stabilized metal colloids using conventional reducing agents: preparation of palladium colloid A 0.5 g (2.23 mmol) quantity of Pd (ac) 2 and 1 g (1.30 mmol ) N(dodecyl)4Br were dissolved in 110 ml of THF. The flask was evacuated several times and then HZ was introduced via a gas burette under normal pressure. After a while the solution turns black and after 16 h 60.4 N ml (120% ) of HZ had been taken up. THF was added to give a total volume of 110 ml and on addition of 55 ml of H20/Ar, a brown-black precipitate resulted. After standing for 16 h the supernatant liquid was siphoned off and the solid was dried for 3 h in vacuum. The black powder isolated in this manner was redispersible in THF. Yield: 0.27 g (87% ); elemental analysis: Pd 76.73%, C 13.19%, H 2.47%, N 1.64%, Br 3.06%; XPS: Pd(0); mean particle size: 1.8 nm. Preparation of nanoscale platinum powder via platinum colloid (cf. Figs. 16 and 17) The preparation of the platinum colloid was carried out in an analogous manner to the iridium colloid. Batch: 8.9 g (33.6 mmol) PtCl2; 200 ml 0.336 M N(C8H17)4[BEt3H] in THF (67.2 mmol);1000 ml THF. In order to isolate the colloid, the waxy residue was dissolved in 2000 ml of technical quality ether without a protective gas. Addition of 200 ml of pure ethanol brings about the formation of a grey-brown precipitate. After letting the solution stand for 1 h, the clear supernatant solution was removed by siphoning off the liquid. The grey-brown precipitate (soluble platinum colloid) thus obtained was washed 4-5 times under inert gas with approg. 200 ml of pure ethanol until the solution is colourless and the colour of the precipitation changed to grey-black. Washing with 200 ml of THF and drying in vacuum yielded a grey-black platinum powder (4.6 g) which was insoluble in common solvents. Metal content: Pt 92.9%; mean particle size: 2.8 nm. Determination of the initial hydrogenation activity of palladium/C (5% Pd, cinnamic acid test) using the apparatus described in Fig. 18 A 0.2226 g quantity of the palladium catalyst (Table 15, No. 2) was weighed into a 100 ml dropping funnel, the dropping funnel was placed onto the reactor and the complete apparatus was evacuated several times and refilled with H2. The catalyst in the dropping funnel was subsequently suspended in 20 ml ethanol (DAB 7, equilibrated at 25 C) and transferred into the reactor. 80 ml of a solution of 125 g cinnamic acid per litre ethanol (also equilibrated at 25 C ) were then pipetted into the funnel and dropped into the reactor. Afterwards the funnel was rinsed with 20 ml ethanol. The catalyst suspension was equilibrated at 25 C ( 0.2 C) . While the reactor was being charged, it was con- 174 H. Bonnemann et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994)129-177 stantly being flushed with H2. The self-aspirating hollow stirrer was not yet in use. After the pressure equilibrated, the line to the 1 1 precision gas burette (mercury-sealed, coupled to a recorder) was opened and the catalyst suspension stirred with a speed of 2000 rpm. The H2 consumption was registered over a period of 6 min, whereby the first minute was not utilized in the evaluation. Between the second and sixth minute, a Hz consumption of 441.6 ml was measured. Conversion to normal conditions gives a consumption of 81.2 N ml/min. From this, after considering a 10% content of solvent in the catalyst, an activity of 406 N ml/ (g min) can be calculated. Determination of the initial hydrogenation activity of platinum/C (5% Pt, crotonic acid test) using the apparatus described in Fig. 18 The procedure was performed analogous to that for palladium catalysts except that the substrates used were a suspension of 0.1597 g platinum catalyst (Table 16, No. 3) in 20 ml ethanol and 80 ml of ethanolic crotonic acid solution (72.6 g crotonic acid/1). The HZ consumption amounted to 324.2 ml which corresponds to 59.6 N ml/min. The activity of the catalyst after taking into account a solvent content of 10% proved to be 415 N ml/ (g min). Determination of the initial hydrogenation activity of rhodium/C (5% Rh, butyronitrile test) using the apparatus described in Fig. 18 A 0.1904 g quantity of the rhodium catalyst (Table 17, No. 8) was weighed into a 100 ml dropping funnel under inert conditions, the dropping funnel connected to the reactor and the complete apparatus was evacuated and refilled with H2 several times. The catalyst (in the dropping funnel) was subsequently suspended in 50 ml ethanol (air-free, DAB 7) and introduced into the reactor. The dropping funnel was rinsed with an additional 50 ml of ethanol. The reactor was continuously flushed with H2. The catalyst suspension was treated in presence of HZ for 5 min, equilibrated at 40 C ( 0.2 C), and the stirring speed adjusted to 2000 rpm. After the pressure equilibrated the connection to the mercury-sealed precision gas burette (200 ml) was opened. 10 ml butyronitrile (distilled under Ar) was injected through the septum into the catalyst suspension. The HZ consumption was registered per minute. The conversion to N ml H2 per min yields 34.3 N ml/min. Taking into consideration that catalyst contains ca. 10% solvent, the true quantity of catalyst utilized was 0.1714 g, from which a catalyst activity of 263 N ml/ (g min) can be calculated. Determination of the hydrogenation activity of dissolved palladium colloids (cyclohexene test) using the apparatus described in Fig. 18 The procedure was performed analogously to that for the rhodium catalyst except that the substrates used were a solution of a palladium colloid (approx. 5 mg) in 100 ml THF and 10 ml of cyclohegene. The catalyst solution was equilibrated at 25 C without further HZ pretreatment. H. BonneOnn et al. / J. Mol.

The reduction of transition metal salts and oxides using hydrotriorganoborates in organic media allows the production of X-ray amorphous nanopowders of metals and alloys under mild conditions. For example, the reduction of needle-shaped iron oxides at 80°C in organic solvents leads to acicular iron-magnet pigments suitable for recording magnetic signals. The reduction of TiCl4 with K[BEt3H] gives an ether-soluble [Ti(0)·0.5THF] x which serves as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of titanium or zirconium sponges and related systems and as a powerful activator for heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. The use of tetraalkylammonium hydrotriorganoborates as reducing agents leads to colloidal transition metals in organic phases. These colloids may also be obtained using conventional reducing agents after first reacting the metal salts with the stabilizing tetraalkylammonium halide. Colloidal metals prepared in this way serve as sources for heterogeneous metal catalysts. Keywords hydrotriorganoborates metal colloids metal particles References 1 (a) R. Kieffer F. Benesovsky 4.
