POLYMER-SUPPORTED RUTHENIUM ACETATE AS AN OLEFIN HYDROGENATION CATALYST^ CHRISTAKIS P. NICOLAIDES and NEIL J. COVILLE* Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2001 (South Africa) (Received June 23,1983; accepted November 1,1983) Summary The reaction of RuC^' SH^O and a carboxylate polymer (synthesized from a chloromethylated resin) in ethanol-glacial acetic acid yields a polymer- supported ruthenium complex with predominantly unidentate metal acetate bonding. This complex is readily eluted from the polymer under catalytic conditions in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 85 C. Addition of MeCOaNa to the above ruthenium complex in ethanol-glacial acetic acid results in forma- tion of a new polymer-supported ruthenium complex containing bridging acetate groups, and which shows only minimal complex elution at 85 C (DMF). It is suggested that this ruthenium complex is the polymer-supported analogue of [Ru30(02CMe)6(H20)3]\"1\". The activity of this supported com- plex as an olefin hydrogenation catalyst has been studied and the hydrogena- tion of cyclooctene has shown a reaction rate proportional to [Ru], [H;] and [olefin]/(I + [olefin]). The catalyst is not sensitive to oxygen and can be re-used with only a slight decrease in reaction rate. Introduction A wide range of metal carboxylate complexes have been synthesized and a number of these have been shown to display catalytic properties [1]. More specifically, metal trimers of the general formula [M30(02CR)6L3]\"1\" where M = Ru, Rh, Co and Mn, L = H^O, MeCOzH and DMF, and R = Me, have been shown to act as catalysts for olefin hydrogenation reactions [2] and for the oxidation of olefins [3,4] and saturated hydrocarbons [5]. ^For Part 1, see ref. 7. * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 376 These catalysts have been found to be moderately stable under oxidizing conditions [6], a property of importance in industrial catalysis. Our current interest in the use of polymer-supported catalysts [7] sug- gested to us that polymer-supported complexes of type 1 (Fig. 1) might be (\"-') Fig. 1. Structure of polymer-supported JLl3-oxo-metal acetate complexes. well suited to synthesis, characterization and study. We have initially chosen to investigate the polymer-supported complex [m^C^C^CR^La]\"^ (R = Me, L = DMF), la, as an olefin hydrogenation catalyst, since (1) the reaction with the homogeneous catalyst has been studied in great detail [2, 8] and a comparison between the homogeneous catalyst and the polymer-supported analogue can provide information on the advantages and disadvantages of polymer supports in catalysis, and (2) we have a long-standing interest in the catalytic properties of ruthenium complexes and are presently using ruthenium as a probe in polymer- supported catalysis. We have already reported on our catalytic studies using polymer-supported Rud2(PPh3)3 [7] and the catalytic properties of polymer- supported H4Ru4(CO)i2-n(PPh3)n and (l?s-C5H5)Ru(CO)2H are presently under investigation [9]. In this study we report on a strategy used to synthesize complexes of type 1 attached to a polystyrene-divinylbenzene polymer support and on the use of la as an olefin hydrogenation catalyst. It is to be noted that attachment of [RuaCKC^CMe)^]\"*\" to ion-exchange resins has already been reported [8,10,11]. Experimental RuCl3- 3H20 was purchased from Engelhard and Strem Chemicals. The chloromethylated polymer was a gift from Klipfontein Organic Products, Johannesburg (manufacturer's specifications: 81% chloromethylated poly- styrene crosslinked with 0.2% divinylbenzene but with 4% effective cross- linking due to secondary reactions). The olefins were purchased from B.D.H., Merck Chemicals and Koch-Light, and were passed down a short silica-gel column (Merck, Kieselgel 60) to remove inhibitors. [Ru30(02CMe)6- (H20)3][MeC02] was prepared by the published method [11]. Elemental analyses were performed by the Microanalytical Labora- tories, N.C.R.L., C.S.I.R., Pretoria (C, H, N, Cl) and Galbraith Laboratories, 377 Inc. (Ru). IR spectra were recorded on a Pye Unicam SP300 spectropho- tometer and mass spectra were recorded on a VARIAN MAT CH5 spec- trometer (70 eV). Preparation of 4 Chloromethylated polymer 2 (20.0 g, ~ 0.11 mol of C^Cl units) and a two-molar excess of KCN (14.3 g) were added to DMF (140 ml) and water (30 ml) and the mixture heated with stirring for 10 h at 120 C. On comple- tion of the reaction the polymer was filtered, and purified by Soxhiet extrac- tion with ethanol until the extractant solvent no longer contained Cl~, as detected by AgN03. The polymer was then hydrolysed with a two-molar excess of NaOH (8.8 g) in moist ethanol (150 ml) at reflux for 10 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy. The carboxylate polymer was then purified by Soxhiet extraction procedures as described above. Preparation of la (L = H^O) Polymer 4, as prepared above, (7.0 g, ~ 0.021 mol of CI^CC^\" units) and RuCLj^Hp (4.0 g, 0.015 mol) were heated in ethanol/MeCOzH (75 ml: 75 ml) at reflux for 16 h. During this time the polymer changed colour from yellow to brown or green. After filtration, MeCOiNa (7.0 g, 0.5 mol) was added to the polymer in ethanol/MeCOzH (75 ml:75 ml) and the reaction was allowed to proceed at reflux for a further 16 h. No attempt was made to maximize reaction conditions. On completion of the reaction the dark green polymer, la, was purified by Soxhiet extraction with ethanol. Preparation of la (L = pyridine) Excess pyridine (2.0 ml) and polymer la (0.5 g) were reacted in methanol (15 ml) for 5 min at reflux. The polymer was then filtered off and thorough- ly washed with ethanol to remove excess pyridine. The polymer displayed an enhanced green colour and the IR spectrum (KBr) exhibited characteristic bands at 1610,1490,1450,1220,1075, 765 and 705 cm-1. Preparation of la (L = PPh^) PPh3 (1.1 g) was added to warm degassed methanol (25 ml). Polymer la (0.5 g) was added to this solution and the reaction stirred at reflux for 6 h. After filtration the green polymer was purified by Soxhiet extraction with ethanol. The IR spectrum (KBr) indicated new bands at 1440, 1415(?), 1098, 750 and 705cm-1. Catalytic procedure Catalytic reactions were typically carried out in DMF under hydrogen (625 mmHg) in a water bath pre-set at 85 0.5 C at a constant stirring rate. Reactions were monitored by hydrogen uptake, as described previously [7]. The olefin, solvent and polymer were routinely degassed under nitrogen prior to use. The total reaction volume used was ~ 20 ml. 378 Results and discussion Synthesis In a continuation of our previous work [7], polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene was chosen as the polymer support for the metal carboxylate complexes. More specifically, a commercially available chloro- methylated polystyrene (2, Fig. 2) crosslinked with 0.2% divinylbenzene NaOH m /^\\ H* CH;COONa > ^|| (C}) CH^COOH t 5. Fig. 2. Reaction scheme for the synthesis of 5. was used as the starting material in the synthesis of la.Thechloromethylated polymer (81% ring functionalization) was converted to the nitrile polymer, 3, by known procedures [12]. On completion of the above reaction, polymer 3 was filtered off and purified by Soxhiet extraction procedures. After removal of Cl~ the polymer was analyzed by IR and mass spectroscopy. The IR spectrum indicated the presence of the CN group (f(CN) at 2250 cm\"1 [12,13]) and the absence of the CH^Cl group (disappearance of the characteristic CH; wag of the CH^Cl group at 1250 cm~1 [14]). The mass spectrum, not previously reported, also confirmed the presence of the CH^CN group [13] (Table 1, Fig. 3). Elemental analysis of a series of polymers prepared in this manner revealed that all contained less than 0.5% chlorine (Table 2). Hydrolysis of polymer 3 was carried out with NaOH [15]. The polymer was then purified by Soxhiet extraction. IR analysis of the hydrolysed product indicated the absence or near complete absence of the CN group and the appearance of new IR bands at 1670 cm\"1 due to the presence of CONH; [16] (6c (Fig. 4)) and at 1575 and 1380 cm-1 due to COzNa [16] (Fig. 5(a) and 6b). The intensity of the CONH2 absorption was found to de- crease if the hydrolysis is carried out in excess water. Further confirmation of the presence of the polymer-attached carboxylate group was provided by reactions of 4 with acid to give 5. Changes in the IR spectrum on formation of 5, e.g. appearance of v(OCO) bands at 1710 and 1370 cm\"1, were con- sistent with formation of an acid group [16] (Fig. 5(b)). Attempts were then made to synthesize the polymer-bound [Ru^O^CMe)^]* complex using polymer 4. 379 TABLE 1 Mass spectrum of 38 m/2 Rel.

(i) A standard procedure for attaching metal complexes to polymers is via ligand exchange between the preformed complex and polymer-bound ligands. Our attempts to use this approach in the reaction of 4 and [Ru30- ((^CMe^La]\"*\" (L = H20) were unsuccessful, as no attachment of the ru- thenium complex to the polymer occurred, as determined by elemental analysis and polymer colour changes. 380 TABLE 2 Elemental analyses of polymers Polymer3 %C %H %C1 %N %Ru 2 73.83 6.43 19.96 3 82.38 6.52 <0.30 7.92 4 61.19 5.97 <0.30 3.09 5 72.55 6.12 <0.30 3.71 7a 63.09 5.79 5.72 3.21 7.27 7b 65.89 5.84 1.18 1.49 4.64 7c 61.11 5.68 2.91 1.15 8.77 7d 61.18 5.90 2.60 1.10 8.09 la(i) 65.35 4.59 0.79 2.45 7.43 la(ii) 65.02 6.00 0.69 3.71 7.06 la(iii) 64.03 5.96 0.54 3.72 6.27 la(iv) 66.32 5.69 0.76 3.42 5.42 la(v) 65.98 6.18 0.66 4.08 5.18 \"Polymers la(i) - la(v) refer to different batches of la.

(ii) An alternative approach, which makes use of the synthetic strategy employed in synthesizing the homogeneous complex [II], but with replace- ment of the homogeneous acetate ligands by 4, was then employed. Products obtained from this route were of variable composition and colour (brown to green) but significantly green polymers were obtained when high [4]/[Ru] ratios and long reaction times were employed (Table 3). The green polymers were shown to consist predominantly of the required polymer-supported oxo-ruthenium complex as determined by analytical, chemical and spectroscopic properties (see below). It is to be noted that the homogeneous oxo-ruthenium complex requires a 2:1 [acetate]: [Ru] ratio and is dark green [11]. The brown polymers, which are obtained using low [4]/[Ru] ratios, can be expected to contain polymer-supported 381 1800 1600 1400 1200 1800 1600 1400 1200 cm cm\" Fig. 5.

Unfortunately, the products, 7, obtained from the above synthesis always contained a mixture of brown and green materials in various proportions. Further, Soxhiet extraction procedures (DMF) [2, 7] used to purify the polymers indicated elution of a brown complex from the polymer, e.g. almost total elution occurred for 7a but minimal elution occurred for 7b. Polymers of type 7b did retain their green colour after Soxhiet extraction. 382 TABLE 4 IR spectral data for selected acetate compounds and polymers\" ComplexMeCO^Na1' MeCOaH\" 2<1 V(OCO)1578 1717 1414 1390 Polymer 1600(m) backbone 1495(ms) 1485(sh) 1430(ms) 1410(ms) 3s 1610(w) 1510(m) 1480(w) 1450(m) 1420(s) A1 1576(vs) 1380(vs) l610(m) 1510(m) - 1445(sh) 1420(sh) 5 1710(vs) 1370(m) 1610(sh) 1510(m) - 1445(w) 1420(m) 7a 1656(s) 1370(mw)g 1610(w) 1510(m) - 1440(w) 1420(m) 1720(vs) la'-\" 1570(m) 1420(s) 1610(m) 1510(m) - 1440(sh) 1420(s) 1720(m) [Ru30(02CMe)6L3r-1 1580 1417 a Recorded in KBr (cm~1).

(iii) A modification of the above synthetic procedure was thus em- ployed to circumvent the problem of product mixtures and to convert these intermediate products contained in 7a - 7d into the required triruthenium complex, la. This was achieved by the addition of extra acetate ligands in the form of MeCOzNa to polymers 7a - 7d in glacial acetic acid/ethanol, which produced dark green polymers. No product elution was observed on purification of these new polymers, la, using Soxhiet extraction procedures. It is to be noted that addition of MeCOzNa to RuC^- 3tl^0 and 4 prior to the formation of polymer 7 is not a viable strategy as homogeneous [RuaO- (02CMe)6L3]\"1\" is produced by this procedure. The nature of la was confirmed by IR spectroscopy, elemental anal- yses, chemical reactivity and catalytic activity. The IR data of 7 (KBr), as well as the spectra of various related polymers are listed in Table 4 and shown in Fig. 5. Major differences in the spectra of 7a - 7d before and after addition of acetate ions relate to absorptions in the 1420 -1390 cm\"1 and 1590 -1560 cm\"1 regions of the IR spectrum. Ab- sorptions in these regions increase as the green colour of the polymers increases in intensity. These regions correspond to the positions of the v(OCO)sym a\"d f(OCO)asym of a bridging carboxylate group respectively. (Fig. 6(b)). The corresponding bands for the dark green homogeneous com- plex [Ru30(02CMe)6(H20)]+ appear at 1410 and 1580 cm-1 [18,19], and suggest that the dark green polymers correspond to the polymer-supported 383 0 0 M -CH,C CH,C 0 M 0 M (a) (b) Fig. 6. (a) Unidentate metal-carboxylate and (b) bridging metal-carboxylate bonding modes. oxo-triruthenium acetate. At the same time, an absorption at 1655 cm\"1 was observed to decrease in intensity as the polymer changed colour from brown to green. This absorption occurs in the region corresponding to unidentate acetate coordination. Fig. 6(a) [20 - 22], and suggests that as the polymer changes colour, the acetate bonding mode changes from a unidentate to a bridging mode. This indicates that in the intermediate polymers the metal complex is coordinated to the polymer predominantly via a unidentate acetate coordination mode, and that addition of additional acetate ions results in a change of the ruthenium acetate bonding mode. The elemental analyses indicate that the Cl content decreases with in- creasing formation of la (cf. Table 2 where the Cl/Ru ratio varies from 2.2 for 7a to 0.7 for 7b) and is not inconsistent with polymers 7 serving as intermediates in the formation of la. We have not, however, investigated the manner in which 7a - 7d are converted into la upon addition of acetate ions. The formulation of complex la as the polymer-supported ruthenium trimer is further indicated by the reaction of la with pyridine and PPh3 to give dark blue and light green complexes respectively. These complexes have colours and IR spectra similar to those reported for the homogeneous complex ^O^CMe^r, L = py [23], PPh3 [18]. In summary, evidence for the formulation of the polymer-supported ruthenium acetate complex as la is as follows: (1) A similar synthetic methodology was used to produce both the dark green homogeneous metal complex [11] and la. Although a dimeric ru- thenium acetate complex was initially proposed for the dark green homo- geneous product, a crystal structure determination confirmed the trimetallic nature of the complex [23]. The red dimeric complex [Ru2(02CMe)4]Cl is formed by the reaction of RuC^- 3H^O with a mixture of acetic acid, acetic anhydride and alkali chloride [24]. (2) IR absorptions at 1570 and 1420 -1390 cm~1 and lack of an ab- sorption at 1655 cm\"1 is consistent with the presence of bridging acetate groups. (3) The expected changes in the elemental compositions (Cl/Ru ratio) with conversion of 7 into la have been observed. Further, the reactant ratios used in the synthesis of la are in accordance with the complex structure. (4) The IR analysis of the products from the reaction of la with PPh3 and pyridine indicate the expected products. 384 (5) Catalytic results for la are similar to those obtained for [Ri^O- (02CMe)6(H20)3][02CMe] (see below). Catalysis The synthesis of [Ri^C^t^CMe^H^C^]\"*\" free from impurities is a non- trivial problem [2,11]. However, attachment of the oxo-ruthenium acetate to a polymer backbone has circumvented this problem. Indeed, purification of polymer la has proven to be trivial using Soxhiet extraction procedures and readily removes unreacted MeC^Na which would otherwise inhibit reactions catalysed by the ruthenium complex [2]. The extensive catalytic study of [Ri^C^l^CMe)^]-^]\"^ by Rempel and co-workers [2, 8] has allowed us to make further comparisons with the polymer-supported system. The olefin hydrogenation reaction [625 mmHg, 85 0.5 C, DMF] was chosen as a reference reaction, and our results using cyclooctene as olefin are described below. The induction period observed in the catalytic reactions was found to vary from 3 - 6 h, but this period was substantially reduced on re-use of the catalyst [2]. (1) Effect of olefin concentration: The reaction rate was found to be proportional to [olefin]/(l + [olefin]) (Figs. 7 and 8). (2) Effect of catalyst concentration: The reaction rate was found to be linearly dependent on ruthenium concentration at high olefin concentration (Fig. 9). (3) Effect of hydrogen pressure: For mixtures of N3 and H; the reac- tion rate was proportional to [B.^] (Fig. 10). The combination of the above variables allows us to obtain a rate law of the form _fe[Ru][H2] [olefin] 1 + [olefin] Fig. 7.

Effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the hydrogenation of cyclooctene (sample la(iv), 1.00 g; [olefin] = 1.92 M). This is the same form of the rate law (for the above variables) as found for the homogeneous catalyst. (4) Effect of sodium acetate concentration. Our results indicate a non- linear decrease in reaction rate with increasing sodium acetate concentration. This is to be compared with a linear decrease for the homogeneous catalyst. (5) Effect of acid concentration: The olefin hydrogenation reaction was carried out in the presence of added HC104. As with the homogeneous catalyst, an increase in equilibration time was observed but the reaction rate never returned to its original rate, even after long reaction times. For in- stance, addition of 0.4 M HC104 resulted in a doubling of the induction time and a reaction rate of only one-third of the rate in the absence of acid. The decrease in reaction rate is observed irrespective of whether the acid is added at the start of the reaction or after attainment of the maximum rate [2]. However, catalyst elution was also observed on addition of HC104 and it is possible that this phenomenon could account for the lower reaction rate. 386 TABLE 5 Rate of hydrogenation of cyclooctene with recycled catalyst'1 Reaction Rate (ml H; min~1) TABLE 6 Rates of hydrogenation of substrates Type of substrate Rate1' (ml H^min\"1) 1 0.42 2 0.38 3 0.37 4 0.36 5b 0.30 1 1-octene l.OO\" 2 cyclooctene 0.45 3 phenylacetylene 0.12 4 styrene 0.76 5 eugenol 0.84 6 cycloheptene 0.49 7 cyclododecatriene 0.46 'l.OO g of polymeric catalyst la(iv), (% Ru = 5.42%), 15.0 mJ DMF, 5.0 ml cyclooctene, 85 C. b Amount Ru after 5th reac- tion = 5.18% (Table 2, la(iv)). \"[olefin] = 1.54 M in DMF; total volume = 20.0 ml; reaction temperature = 85 C. b All rates relative to the rate of hydrogena- tion of 1-octene.

(6) Re-use of catalyst: No precautions were made to exclude oxygen from the polymer before or after a catalytic reaction, and repeated use of the catalyst resulted in only a small rate decrease (Table 5). The ability to recycle the catalyst, as well as its oxygen insensitivity, has been noted for the homogeneous catalyst [2]. No substantial changes were observed in the IR spectra of 35a after use in the catalytic reactions. However, the IR spectra recorded on the polymer-supported catalysts after repeated use indicated a small amount of metal-carbonyl bond formation (v(CO) ~1970 cm\"1). This suggests that minor modification of the catalyst under the reaction conditions is occurring [2]. However, any new products formed in the polymer are not catalytically active as their appearance coincides with a decrease in catalytic activity of the polymer (Table 5). (7) Effect of substrate modification: Hydrogenation of different sub- strates was carried out and the results are reported in Table 6. In summary the results indicate: (i) the reaction rate follows the order terminal olefin > cyclic olefin > alkyne (ii) the olefin size ('bulkiness') is not a significant factor in affecting the reaction rate (cf. substrates 2, 6, 7, Table 6). The data thus suggest that catalysis occurs predominantly at the polymer surface. Indeed, we have observed that the polymer breaks down into a powder during the synthesis of the nitrile and carboxylate polymers. Observation of these polymers under a microscope reveals that their physical state has changed from spheres to platelets. 387 Acknowledgements We wish to thank the University, the CSIR, Pretoria, and AECI Ltd for their generous financial support.

Coville 2 Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg 2001 South Africa 2 Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. The reaction of RuCl3·3H2O and a carboxylate polymer (synthesized from a chloromethylated resin) in ethanol-glacial acetic acid yields a polymer-supported ruthenium complex with predominantly unidentate metal acetate bonding. This complex is readily eluted from the polymer under catalytic conditions in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 85 °C. Addition of MeCO2Na to the above ruthenium complex in ethanol-glacial acetic acid results in formation of a new polymer-supported ruthenium complex containing bridging acetate groups, and which shows only minimal complex elution at 85 °C (DMF). It is suggested that this ruthenium complex is the polymer-supported analogue of [Ru3O(O2CMe)6(H2O)3]+. The activity of this supported complex as an olefin hydrogenation catalyst has been studied and the hydrogenation of cyclooctene has shown a reaction rate proportional to [Ru], [H2] and [olefin]/(1 + [olefin]). The catalyst is not sensitive to oxygen and can be re-used with only a slight decrease in reaction rate. References 1 A. Dobson S.O. Robinson Platinum Metals Rev. 20 1976 56 2 S.A. Fouda G.L.
