IMPROVEMENTS BY IMMOBILIZATION OF SELECTIVE CATALYSTS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF 4-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID [1] MAKOTO KOMIYAMA, IZURU SUGIURA and HIDEFUMI HIRAI Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113 (Japan) (Received September 2,1985 .accepted February 11,1986) Summary Improvements of P-cyclodextrin (j3-CyD) as a catalyst for selective syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids have been achieved by its immobi- lization. Three types of immobilized (3-CyD catalysts I, II, and III (with molar ratios 5.7, 3.3 and 1.2, respectively, of (3-CyD residue to 2-hydroxy- propyi residue) were prepared by the reaction of (3-CyD with epichloro- hydrin. All the immobilized catalysts exhibit 100% selectivity and high (larger than 80 mol%) yield for the syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids from the corresponding phenols and carbon tetrachloride in alkaline aqueous solutions. In the absence of the immobilized catalysts, however, the yields and the selectivities are much lower: 15 mol% and 56% for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The selectivities (100%) exhibited by the im- mobilized catalysts are considerably larger than the values (92 - 99%) obtained with free j3-CyD catalyst. The immobilized |8-CyD catalysts are easily recovered from the reaction mixtures either by centrifugation or by filtration, and are successfully re-used without any measurable loss in the catalytic activity. The enhancement of the selective catalysis of (3-CyD by immobilization has been attributed to a specific reaction field effect produced by many alkoxide ions of |3-CyD residues in the immobilized catalysts. Introduction Interest in the use of cyclodextrins (CyDs), cyclic oligomers of 6 - 8 glucose molecules, as catalysts for selective syntheses has been rapidly growing [2-17]. Specific catalyses by CyDs involve regioselectivity, regula- tion of molecular size of products, and/or protection of unstable products from undesired subsequent reactions. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 272 An immobilized CyD catalyst, prepared by the reaction of a-cyclo- dextrin with epichlorohydrin, was used as selective catalyst forpara-chlorina- tion of anisole with hypochlorous acid [18]. Previously [10,17], the authors succeeded in selective syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids from phenols and carbon tetrachloride with the use of (3-cyclodextrin ((3-CyD) as catalyst. In the presence of j3-CyD, formation of orffto-carboxylated phenols, which prevailed in its absence, was largely sup- pressed, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids were prepared in selectivities larger than 97%. In this paper, it is shown that /?-CyDs immobilized with epichlorohydrin are even better catalysts for the selective syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids than free j8-CyD. 100% selectivity is achieved with the use of the im- mobilized j3-CyD catalysts. Separation and recovery of the immobilized catalysts from the reaction mixtures and their repeated usage are shown. Equilibrium constants for the complex formation between the ^-CyD residue of the immobilized catalysts and phenol are determined. Furthermore, the superb catalytic activities of the immobilized fS-CyD catalysts are discussed in terms of specific reaction field effects produced by the polymeric struc- tures. Experimental Materials Phenol and 2-methylphenol from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. were dis- tilled. a- and jS-CyDs (Nakarai Chemical Co.) were recrystallized from water. Copper metal particles from Yoneyama Chemicals were used without further purification. All other chemicals were purified by the usual methods. Preparation of immobilized f^-CyD catalysts Three types of immobilized ^-CyD catalysts I, II and III were prepared by the reaction of (3-CyD with epichlorohydrin at charged molar ratios of 1:20, 1:10 and 1:1.4, respectively, according to a modified method of the literature one [19]. Thus, 50.0 g (44.1 mmol) of (3-CyD and 50.0 mg (1.32 mmol) of sodium tetrahydroborate were dissolved in 80 ml of 50 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, to which various amounts of epichloro- hydrin (69.0, 34.5, and 4.8 ml; 882, 441, and 61.6 mmol, respectively) were added dropwise. The mixtures were kept at 50 C for 40 min, during which they were vigorously stirred with a mechanical stirrer. Then, 150 ml of acetone was added, followed by sufficient washing of the resulting solids with acetone and with water. The solids were dried in vacua at 60 C for 12 h. Catalysts I and II were obtained as white beads with diameters 1 - 3 mm, whereas catalyst III was a gummy paste. Elemental analyses on the catalysts I and II were as follows: C, 48.40% and H, 7.13% for catalyst I; C, 47.00% and H, 6.60% for catalyst II. These values showed that the molar ratios of the 2-hydroxypropyl residue derived 273 from epichlorohydrin, to the (3-CyD moiety in catalysts I and II, respectively, were 5.7 and 3.3. The molar ratio of the 2-hydroxypropyl group to (5-CyD in catalyst III, determined by ^ NMR spectroscopy in deuterium oxide, was 1.2. Immobilized cx-CyD catalyst IV was similarly prepared by the reaction of 50.0 g (51.4 mmol) of a-CyD with 40.2 ml (514 mmol) of epichloro- hydrin, in the form of beads with diameters of 1 - 3 mm. Selective syntheses with virgin immobilized f^-CyD catalysts The immobilized j3-CyD catalyst (1.5 g), phenol or 2-methylphenol (1.5 g), and copper powder (0.2 g) were added to 20 ml of 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Then, carbon tetrachloride (3.0 ml) was charged into the solution at 80 C under nitrogen, and the reaction was continued at 80 C for 15 h. After the reaction, the mixture was acidified with hydrochloric acid, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Both the solution and the resulting solid were separately extracted vigorously with ethyl ether. All the ether layers were collected and evaporated. Product analyses were made with the use of HPLC (Toyo Soda Co., LS410K, MeOH-100 column, 30 cm, 25 C; eluent, 6:4 water-ethanol). Repeated usage of immobilized ft-CyD catalysts Phenol (1.5 g) and carbon tetrachloride (3.0 ml) were reacted in 20 ml of 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of the im- mobilized p-CyD catalyst (1.5 g) and copper powder (0.2 g) at 80 C for 15 h, in a manner similar to that described above. Then the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The liquid phase was acidified with hydrochloric acid, and was vigorously extracted with ethyl ether. The ether layer was evaporated, and was subjected to HPLC analysis. The solid obtained by centrifugation was added to 20 ml of 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution containing 1.5 g of phenol. Carbon tetrachloride (3.0 ml) was added at 80 C, and the reaction was continued at 80 C for 15 h. After the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the liquid phase was acidified and extracted with ethyl ether. The ether layer was evaporated, and was subjected to HPLC analysis. The solid, obtained by centrifugation, was used as catalyst for the following reaction. Further repeated usage of the catalysts was carried out similarly. Determination of equilibrium constant for the complex formation offS-CyD residue in the immobilized catalysts with phenol 200 mg of the immobilized catalysts were added to 5 ml of 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution of phenol, and the specimens were kept at 30 C with vigorous shaking. After 2 days, the solids were separated by centrifugation, and the concentration of phenol in the liquid phase was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Attainment of equilib- 274 rium was confirmed by the fact that the absorption values determined after 7 days incubation of duplicate specimens were identical with those deter- mined after 2 days incubation. The results were analyzed by use of eqn. (1), which was based on the assumption that the (3-CyD residue in the immobilized catalysts and phenol formed a 1:1 complex. [phenol] = [;3-CyD]eff [phenol]/[complex] - K^ (1) Here, [phenol] and [complex] are the equilibrium concentrations of phenol and the 1:1 complex between the (3-CyD residue and phenol, respectively, and can be determined by absorption spectroscopy. K^ is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex between phenol and the j3-CyD residue in the immobilized catalysts. [<3-CyD]eff is the effective concentra- tion of the j3-CyD residue in the immobilized catalyst, which is accessible by phenol and has potentiality for catalytic functions. Equation (1) is easily obtained from eqn. (2): Kd = (D3-CyD]e - [complex] )[phenol]/[complex] (2) Thus, the values of K^ and [<3-CyD]eff were determined from the inter- cepts and the slopes, respectively, for the straight lines in the plots of [phenol] us. [phenol]/[complex]. The equilibrium constant K^ for the dissociation of the complex between free /5-CyD and phenol in 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was determined by use of eqn. (3). [(3-CyD]o[phenol]o/Ad = ([(3-CyD]o + [phenol]o)Ae + K^/Ae (3) Here, Ad is the observed change in the absorbance at 280 nm, and Ae is difference in the molar absorption coefficient between phenol and the j3-CyD-phenol complex. Subscript 0 refers to the charged concentration. Results Selective syntheses using virgin immobilized P-CyD catalysts Table 1 shows the results for the reactions of phenols and carbon tetra- chloride in the presence and the absence of the immobilized j3-CyD catalysts. With all the immobilized j3-CyD catalysts I, II and III, the selectivity for the corresponding para-carboxylated phenols, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4- hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid, are 100%, and their yields are satisfactorily high (> 85 mol%). In their absence, however, the yields of the para-carbox- ylated phenols are low, and in addition the selectivities for them are only around 50%. Thus, the immobilized jS-CyD catalysts exhibit remarkable enhancements both in selectivity and yield for the poro-carboxylated phenols. Quite importantly, the selectivities (100% for both 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid) exhibited by the immobilized 275 TABLE 1 Reactions of phenols with carbon tetrachloride in the presence and the absence of im- mobilized 0-CyD catalysts' Phenols Immobilized Yield (mo^)\" Selectivity for (3-CyDcatalyst p-carboxylated phenol p-carboxylated o-carboxylated p^^phenol (%) phenol I 91 0 100 II 95 0 100 m 100 0 100 IV6 46 32 59 free 0-CyD 98 2 98 none 15 12 56 2-methylphenol n 87 0 100 free p-CyD 84 4 95 none 28 26 52 \"Reaction conditions: phenol (1.5 g), jS-CyT) catalyst (1.5 g), copper powder (0.2 g), car- bon tetrachloride (3.0 ml); in 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 80 C for 15 h under nitrogen. ^'The average of the values for duplicate runs, which agree with each other within 4%. \"Immobilized Ot-CyD catalyst. f3-CyD catalysts are significantly larger than the values (98% for 4-hydroxy- benzoic acid and 95% for 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid) by free ^-CyD catalyst. Formation of the ortfto-carboxylated phenols, which takes place to some extent even in the presence of free (3-CyD, is definitely inhibited with the use of the immobilized ^-CyD catalysts. Superiority of the selective catalysis by the immobilized ^-CyD cata- lysts to that by free j3-CyD catalyst is more vividly observed when the amount of charged copper powder is larger (see Table 2). With the catalysis by free ^-CyD, the selectivity for 4-hydroxybenzoic acids gradually decreases with increasing amounts of the charged copper powder, although the yields increase. In the presence of the immobilized (3-CyD catalysts, however, the selectivity remains constant at 100% even in the presence of large amounts of copper powder, where high yield is attained. The immobilized cc-CyD catalyst IV shows minimal selective catalysis, as also shown in Table 1. The selectivity for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is virtually identical with the value for the reaction without it, although the yield is larger. The yields of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid from phenol at a reaction time of 3 h were 40, 52, and 60 mol%, respectively, for the immobilized catalysts I, II, and III. Thus, the catalytic rate decreases with increasing degree of crosslinking in the catalyst. 276 TABLE 2 Effect of the amount of copper powder on the selectivity for the syntheses of 4-hydroxy- benzoic acids catalyzed by the immobilized p-CyD catalyst II or by free p-CyD' Charged amount of copper powder (g) Selectivity for benzoic acid (' 4-hydroxy-%)b.< Selectivity for 4-hy methylbenzoic acid droxy-3-(%)c,d immobilized P-CyD catalyst II free P-CyD catalyst immobilized p-CyD catalyst II free p-CyD catalyst 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.50 100 (65) 100 (100) 100 (100) 99 (32) 99 (59)6 98 (98) 96 (99) 100 (53) 100 (87) 100 (90) 97 (58)e 95 (89) 92 (92) \"Reaction conditions: phenol (1.5 g), p-CyD catalyst (1.5 g), carbon tetrachloride (3.0 ml); in 20 wt.% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at 80 C for 15 h under nitrogen. b Reaction of phenol with carbon tetrachloride.

This result confirms the validity of the assumption that the j3-CyD residue in the immobilized catalysts forms a 1:1 complex with phenol (in anionic form), which is used for the derivation of eqn. (1). Table 3 lists the values of K^ and l^-CyD]ef{ evaluated from these plots. The immobilized <3-CyD catalysts exhibit considerably larger K.^ values than free ^-CyD. The K^ values for the immobilized catalysts decrease with de- creasing degree of crosslinking (catalyst I > catalyst II > catalyst III). The effective concentrations [|3-CyD]ef( for the immobilized catalysts I - III are larger than 85% of the charged concentrations of ^-CyD in them. Thus, a large part of the ^-CyD residues in the immobilized catalysts is accessible by phenol in the alkaline aqueous solutions. Repeated usage of immobilized IS-CyD catalysts Figure 2 depicts the results for the repeated usage of the immobilized <3-CyD catalysts I and III. Here, the immobilized catalysts were separated by centrifugation together with copper powder after the reaction. In the following reaction using the recovered solid as catalyst, only phenol and carbon tetrachloride were additionally charged to alkaline aqueous solution. In all the repeated reactions with the catalysts I and II, the selectivities for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid are 100%, and the yields are ~90 mol%. No mea- surable decrease in the catalytic activity with increasing number of repeti- tions is observed. Thus, repeated usage of the immobilized catalysts, with- out the addition of copper powder in the repeated reactions, are success- fully achieved by separation of the catalysts from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. Repeated usage of the immobilized <?-CyD catalysts was also achieved by separating them from the reaction mixtures by filtration after the reac- tion. As shown in Fig. 3, the selectivity for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was 100% and its yield was greater than 90 mol% for all the repeated runs when 0.2 g of copper powder, in addition to phenol and carbon tetrachloride, was charged for each of the repeated reactions (o, ).

Recovery of the immobilized fS-CyD catalyst III, which was soluble in the reaction mixture, was accomplished by acidifying the mixture with hydrochloric acid after the reaction.

On repeated usage (8 times), the catalyst exhibited 100% selec- tivity and high yield (larger than 85 mol%) even without the addition of copper powder. For the purpose of comparison, recovery of free (S-CyD and its re-use were also examined. The result is shown in Table 4. After the reaction of phenol (1.6 g) and carbon tetrachloride (3.0 ml) in the presence of 1.5 g of |S-CyD, the reaction mixture was acidified with hydrochloric acid. The resultant precipitates were separated by centrifugation, and were used as catalyst for the following run after being washed with ethyl ether. In three successive runs, the selectivity for the formation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was 100%. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth runs, however, the selectivity decreased to 85, 76 and 60%, respectively. In addition, the yield mono- tonically decreased with increasing number of successive runs. The decrease both in selectivity and in yield is attributable to a decrease of the amount of j8-CyD in the reaction mixture, due to loss of fS-CyD in the recovery procedures. After the sixth run, a measurable amount of ^-CyD was not recovered. Discussion Selective catalysis by the immobilized fS-CyD catalysts The selective catalysis of immobilized ^-CyD for the syntheses of 4- hydroxybenzoic acids from phenols and carbon teteachloride is definitely attributable to the functions of the fS-CyD residues. A possibility that some network structures formed by ^-CyD residues and 2-hydroxypropyl residues in the immobilized |3-CyD catalysts exhibit selective catalysis is ruled out, since catalyst IV, prepared from a-CyD and epiehlorohydrin, shows no measurable selective catalysis (see Table 1). The cavity of a-CyD is too small to accommodate carbon tetrachloride effectively, and thus selective catalysis by a-CyD is minimal [17]. 280 The |3-CyD residues in the immobilized catalysts are rather independent molecules irrespective of the crosslinking structures of the catalysts. This is shown both by the fact that the plot of [phenol] ys. [phenol]/[complex] according to eqn. (1) exhibits good linearity (Fig. 1) and by the fact that the effective concentration ([<3-CyD]eff) of accessible |8-CyD residue is larger than 85% of the charged concentration of fS-CyD (Table 3). In the im- mobilized catalysts, the l,3-dialkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl groups, which bridge the ;3-CyD residues, assume stretching conformations so that the electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged j3-CyD residues can be minimal. In alkaline aqueous solutions, most of the secondary hydroxyl groups of (3-CyD are in their anionic forms, since their pKa is around 12 [2]. These arguments are consistent with the fact that the K^ values for complex formation between the (3-CyD residue and phenol increase with increasing degree of crosslinking in the immobilized catalysts: catalyst I > catalyst II > catalyst III (Table 3). Increasing crosslinking prevents effective segregation of the negatively charged (3-CyD residues, and thus enhances the electrostatic repulsion between the negative charge of phenol and the neg- ative charges in the immobilized catalysts. The j3-CyD residues, which behave as rather independent molecules due to mutual electrostatic repulsion, exhibit selective catalysis in a manner similar to free (3-CyD catalyst [17]. Thus, the selective catalysis proceeds via formation of a ternary molecular complex composed of the f!-CyD residue, phenol, and trichloromethyl cation as electrophilic species. The cation is formed from carbon tetrachloride with a catalysis by copper powder. In the ternary molecular complex, the trichloromethyl cation is located in the cavity of j3-CyD, and phenol in its anionic state penetrates slightly into the cavity from the side involving the para-carbon atom. The penetration of this apolar side of phenol in the apolar cavity is energetically more favorable. Under these situations, the trichloromethyl cation selectivity attacks at the para-carbon atom of phenol, which is located nearby. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acids are formed by the hydrolyses of C C1 bonds in the resulting inter- mediates. Thus, the selective catalysis by the (3-CyD residue in the immobi- lized |3-CyD catalysts is ascribed to a regulation of the mutual conformation between phenol and the trichloromethyl cation through non-covalent inter- actions. The remarkable enhancement in the yield by the immobilized (3-CyD catalysts is associated with effective trapping of the trichloromethyl cations by the negative charges of the catalysts (see below), which suppresses their loss by reactions with hydroxide ions. Enhancement of selectivity by immobilization The larger selectivity (100%) achieved by the immobilized j3-CyD catalysts than the values (92 - 99%) by free <3-CyD catalyst is attributable to the negatively charged reaction field produced by the many ionized hydroxyl groups of (S-CyD residues. The active species, trichloromethyl cations, are rapidly and predominantly trapped inside the immobilized 281 catalysts due to electrostatic attraction, immediately after being formed by the catalysis of copper powder. Alternatively, the cations can be selectively formed from carbon tetrachloride incorporated in the polymer domain, also due to electrostatic interactions. Thus, the reaction involving uncomplexed cation, which exhibits low selectivity, is overwhelmingly suppressed in the presence of the immobilized catalysts. Predominance of the selective reac- tions involving the catalysis of the (3-CyD residue is even more conclusive here. The electrostatic attraction of trichloromethyl cations by the negative charges of (3-CyD is also operative in the selective synthesis of 4-hydroxy- benzoic acid using free (3-CyD [17]. However, the magnitude of the electric field is much larger for the immobilized catalysts, due to enhancement of the local concentrations of (3-CyD residues. The importance of the negatively charged reaction field in the im- mobilized catalysts is clearly shown by the fact that the K^ values for the complex formation of the (3-CyD residue in them with phenol are considerab- ly larger than the value for free (3-CyD (Table 3). The above arguments are supported by the fact that the immobilized (3-CyD catalysts exhibit 100% selectivity even under conditions where the rate of formation of trichloromethyl cation is large due to the presence of large amounts of copper powder (Table 2). All the cations are complexed with the (3-CyD residues prior to their reactions with phenols, since they are strongly attracted by the negatively charged field. In the case of free (3-CyD catalyst, however, some part of the cations can not be successfully com- plexed by (3-CyD when the rate of their formation is too large. Thus, the reaction involving free cation occurs to some extent here, resulting in a de- crease in the selectivity. Repeated usage of immobilized (3-CyD catalysts The immobilized catalysts I and II are successfully recovered from the reaction mixture after the reactions by centrifugation. The catalyst III is also recovered by centrifugation, after being insolubilized by acidifying the reac- tion mixture. As depicted in Fig. 2, all the recovered catalysts can be re- peatedly used as catalysts for the syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids, show- ing 100% selectivities and satisfactorily high yields. These results show that the immobilized (3-CyD catalysts remain intact during the reaction and also in the recovery procedure. Alternatively, the recovery of the immobilized catalysts can be achieved by filtration. The recovered catalysts exhibit 100% selectivity for the forma- tion of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the following run. Thus, immobilized (3-CyD catalysts are also successfully recovered in their intact forms by filtration. Recovery of the immobilized (3-CyD catalysts with centrifugation is superior to that with filtration, in that copper powder is also recovered here and thus no addition of copper powder is required to attain a high yield in the following run. In the recovery with filtration, however, a considerable 282 amount of copper powder is not recovered. High yield in the following run is achieved only when additional copper powder is charged (Fig. 3). The selectivity for the formation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is 100%, either with or without the addition of copper powder. Easy separation of the catalysts from the products and successful repeated usage are certainly advantages for the immobilized /3-CyD catalysts over free ^-CyD catalyst, from the viewpoint of practical application. In the case of free j8-CyD catalyst, the number of successive uses showing 100% selectivity for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is only three. Conclusion Selective syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids from phenols and car- bon tetrachloride are successfully carried out by the use of j3-cyclodextrin immobilized with epichlorohydrin. With the use of these immobilized j3- cyclodextrin catalysts, 100% selectivity, which is not attained by free j3- cyclodextrin catalyst, is achieved. This enhancement in selectivity indicates the important function of the specific reaction field produced only by the polymeric catalysts. The catalysts are easily separated from the reaction mixture either by centrifugation or by filtration, and are repeatedly used without apparent decrease in the catalytic activity, both in the rate accelera- tion and the selectivity. These findings can extend the spectrum of the use of cyclodextrins as catalysts for selective organic syntheses. References 1 Preliminary communication: M. Komiyama, I. Sugiura and H. Hirai, Polym.

Improvements by immobilization of selective catalysts for the synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid [1] Makoto Komiyama Izuru Sugigura Hidefumi Hirai Department of Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113 Japan Improvements of β-cyclodextrin (β-CyD) as a catalyst for selective syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids have been achieved by its immobilization. Three types of immobilized β-CyD catalysts I, II, and III (with molar ratios 5.7, 3.3 and 1.2, respectively, of β-CyD residue to 2-hydroxypropyl residue) were prepared by the reaction of β-CyD with epichlorohydrin. All the immobilized catalysts exhibit 100% selectivity and high (larger than 80 mol%) yield for the syntheses of 4-hydroxybenzoic acids from the corresponding phenols and carbon tetrachloride in alkaline aqueous solutions. In the absence of the immobilized catalysts, however, the yields and the selectivities are much lower: 15 mol% and 56% for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The selectivities (100%) exhibited by the immobilized catalysts are considerably larger than the values (92–99%) obtained with free β-CyD catalyst. The immobilized β-CyD catalysts are easily recovered from the reaction mixtures either by centrifugation or by filtration, and are successfully re-used without any measurable loss in the catalytic activity. The enhancement of the selective catalysis of β-CyD by immobilization has been attributed to a specific reaction field effect produced by many alkoxide ions of β-CyD residues in the immobilized catalysts.
