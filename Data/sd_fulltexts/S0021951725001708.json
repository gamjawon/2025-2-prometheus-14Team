Graphical abstract A facile and simple method strategy is reported for constructing atomically dispersed noble metals on TiO2 with multiple oxygen vacancies by utilizing Ti3+ on Ti2O3 surface as “traps” to anchor and reduce the metal atoms. The as-designed Pt1/TiO2 catalyst with high metal loading exhibits impressive photocatalytic performance with hydrogen evolution rate up to 95,180 μmol g−1 h−1 due to the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Pt single atoms. Single atom catalysts (SACs) supported on metal oxide are usually prepared at high temperature, high pressure, and complex process. Herein, a new strategy is developed to prepare SACs anchored on vacancy-rich TiO2 using Ti2O3 as the support precursor under mild conditions, where Ti3+ on Ti2O3 surface acts as “traps” to capture and then reduce metal ions through electron transfer without using reducing agents. This approach is universally applicable for different single metal atoms supported on diverse phases of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, metastable and mixed counterpart). The as-obtained Pt1/TiO2 with controllable Pt loading and multiple oxygen vacancies (Ov) exhibits excellent activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution. At optimal conditions, the H2 evolution rate is up to 95,180 μmol g−1 h−1, which is the highest for TiO2 supported SACs reported.

In this context, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most investigated and used catalyst because of its high abundance, excellent corrosion resistance, and low cost. In recent years, it has been widely accepted that deposition of noble metal nanoparticles as co-catalyst on TiO2 can facilitate the separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers, and the formed M-O-Ti interface also act as the active sites for H2 production, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution [3–6]. However, when TiO2 was used to support the nanoparticles, the active sites are usually limited to the nanoparticles surface and/or those at the interface between the particles and the support. Thus, the utilization of TiO2 supported nanoparticles are not effective enough and highly dispersed metal catalysts are desired. Recently, many researches have been devoted for the synthesis of TiO2 supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) [7–13], given that SACs are highly dispersed and have shown significant promise in improving metal utilization efficiency and catalytic activity [14–17]. Up to now, several strategies have been developed in this area [18–20], such as photochemical approach [21], defect engineering [7], nanoparticles redispersion [8] and some other strategies [19,22]. Although great progress has been made in the synthesis of SACs, two major challenges remain in the preparation of atomically dispersed catalysts: i) to avoid use of high temperature, high pressure, harmful regents/solvents and complex processes; ii) to ensure the metal loading controllable for catalystic applications. Herein, a facile and efficient strategy was developed to fabricate gram-grade SACs supported on TiO2 (M1/TiO2) with multiple oxygen vacancies (Ov) for H2 evolution under environmentally friendly conditions. In this strategy, Ti2O3 was used as the support precursor, and the surface Ti3+ atoms acted as “traps” to capture and then reduce metal atoms by electron transfer between Ti3+ and metal ions [23]. No extra reductant and harmful regents/solvents were required. The metal loading could be easily regulated by simple changing the added amount of metal precursors due to the presence of abundant Ti3+ “traps”. Ti3+ defects and Ov were retained because of the incomplete oxidation of Ti2O3, which enhanced light absorption and charge carrier separation [24,25], and thus increasing the photocatalytic activity. Notably, under the optimal conditions, the H2 evolution rate was up to 95,180 μmol g−1 h−1, surpassing all the SACs supported on TiO2 reported previously. In addition, this method could be extended to include diverse noble metals (such as Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag) and diverse TiO2 phases (such as anatase, rutile, metastable and mixed crystal phase). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results indicate that Pt single atoms are anchored on TiO2 through strong metal-support interaction, which promotes the generation of interfacial Ov around Pt single atoms and forms Pt-O-Ti3+ atomic interfaces during reaction process, and effectively facilitates photogenerated electrons transfer from Ti3+ defective sites to single Pt atoms, thereby significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution [20]. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), chloroauric acid trihydrate (H2AuCl6·3H2O), palladium chloride (PdCl2), ruthenium(III) chloride (RuCl3) and monolydrate copper(II) actate [Cu(Ac)2·H2O] were purchased from Aladdin. Chloropalladate acid (H2PdCl4) was obtained by dissolving palladium chloride in hydrochloric acid. Titanium(III) chloride (20 % in 15 % hydrochloric acid aqueous solution) was purchased from Macklin. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Deen reagent. Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) was purchased from General-Reagent. Methanol (CH3OH) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36 %–38 %) were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent. All chemicals were used without further purification. 2.2 Catalysts preparation Preparation of Ti2O3. Typically, 5 g of TiCl3 solution (20 % TiCl3 in 15 % hydrochloric acid aqueous solution) was mixed with 13 mL of crystal directing agent solution (saturated NaCl aqueous solution for rutile TiO2, and saturated Na2SO4 aqueous solution for anatase) in a round-bottomed flask under the protection of nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, 4 mL of 0.033 M aqueous NaOH solution was added, and then the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 12 h. After that, the system was cooled to room temperature and the blue Ti2O3 suspension obtained. The blue Ti2O3 was collected through centrifugation and quickly washed by ice water for three times to remove any impurity. Preparation of defect TiO2. The Ov and Ti3+ defect TiO2 was synthesized by exposing Ti2O3 suspension in air, and then collected by centrifugation, washed with water for several times, and freeze vacuum-dried for 10 h. The obtained defect TiO2 was labelled as R-TiO2 for rutile TiO2 and A-TiO2 for anatase TiO2. Preparation of Pt1/TiO2 . The obtained blue Ti2O3 was redispersed in 30 mL of water and heated to 110 °C under the protection of nitrogen atmosphere. At this temperature, suitable amount aqueous H2PtCl6·6H2O solution was injected into the blue suspension. Once the H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution was added, the precipitation turned to yellow and the Pt atoms were anchored on the Ti2O3. After 15 min, the mixture was cooled naturally to room temperature, and then exposed to air for the complete conversion of Ti2O3 into TiO2. The powders in the bottle were collected by centrifugation, then washed by water for several times, and freeze vacuum-dried for 10 h. Other M1/TiO2 single atoms catalysts were synthesized in the similar procedures except that H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution was replaced by chloroauric acid (H2AuCl6·3H2O), chloropalladate acid (H2PdCl4), ruthenium(III) chloride (RuCl3), and silver nitrate (AgNO3), respectively. Furthermore, 20 times large-scale synthesis of Pt1/R-TiO2 was also performed, and 8 g of Pt1/R-TiO2 was obtained per time. Preparation of PtNP/TiO2. For comparison, Pt nanoparticles loaded on rutile TiO2 (PtNP/TiO2) were prepared using traditional impregnation method. At first, 0.2 g of TiO2 power was immersed in 15 mL of water, and 1.54 mL of 0.01 M H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution was added in the TiO2 suspension and stirred for 12 h. Subsequently, 3 mL of aqueous NaBH4 solution (0.1 g NaBH4 mixed with 3 mL of H2O) was dispersed in the suspension and continued to stir for 2 h. In addition, 1.5 wt% Pt nanoparticles loaded TiO2 was prepared by centrifugation, then washed by water for several times, and freeze vacuum-dried for 10 h. The obtained catalyst was labelled as PtNP/TiO2. 2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were performed in a top-irradiation-type quartz reactor at 25 °C and 1 atm. A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing China Education Au-light Co. Ltd., CEL-HXF300-T9, 200–2500 nm) was used as the UV–visible light source. For the typical experiment, 20 mg of the photocatalyst was suspended in 75 mL of aqueous methanol solution containing 20 % methanol in the reactor under stirring constantly. The gaseous products were analyzed by gas chromatograph (FULI, China, GC9790II) with a thermal conductivity detector and Ar gas was utilized as carrying gas. Porapak N, HayeSep A, and 5 Å molecular sieve columns were combined for better separation of the possible gas products. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization The preparation procedure of Pt1/TiO2 catalysts was shown in Fig. 1 a, where Ti2O3 was prepared using TiCl3 as the starting material, then hydrolyzed under the protection of N2 atmosphere. The crystal structure was controlled by adding different directing agents in this step. The Ti2O3 was obtained by simple centrifugation and washing with water to remove any unhydrolyzed Ti3+. Then, aqueous H2PtCl6 solution was quickly injected into the suspension of Ti2O3 in water under a vigorous stirring, and the metal atoms could be immediately anchored by the Ti3+ of Ti2O3 and reduced through electron transfer. Finally, Pt1/Ti2O3 was exposed in air and Ti2O3 was oxidized into TiO2 to obtain Pt SACs supported on different phases of TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2) with multiple Ov and Ti3+ defects (Fig. S1-4). Different metal SACs were synthesized in the similar process (Fig. S5-8). Furthermore, 20 times large-scale synthesis of Pt SACs supported on rutile TiO2 with 1.42 wt% Pt loading (denoted as Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%)) was also performed, and 8 g of Pt1/R-TiO2(1.42 wt%) was botained per time. Taking Pt1/R-TiO2(1.42 wt%) as an example, the formation of isolated metal atoms was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The TEM images (Fig. 1b, c) suggest that the morphology of Pt1/R-TiO2(1.42 wt%) catalyst is a rodlike structure, and no obvious Pt nanoparticles are observed on the rutile TiO2 (R-TiO2) when the Pt loading is 1.42 wt%, as measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1d, e) photographs clearly indicate that most of the Pt atoms are dispersed at the atomic scale as the isolated bright dots, and few atoms fully exposed clusters can be seen in this case. By simply changing the added amount of Pt precursor, other SACs with different Pt loadings can be obtained, which are denoted as Pt1/TiO2 (x wt%) (x = 0.67, 1.81, 2.00), and x wt% represents the mass percentage of Pt (Fig. S9-11). Further increase the loading to 2.00 wt%, still no obvious Pt nanoparticles were observed (Fig. S11). To understand catalytic activity of the Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%), it is essential to reveal the interfacial bonding mode of the isolated metal species at TiO2 surfaces, and the coordination microenvironment of Pt single atoms. For this purpose, element-selective X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement was performed (Fig. 1f, g). The normalized Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) curves of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) shows that different from the reference Pt foil and PtO2 (Fig. 1f), there is no Pt0 in the Pt1/R-TiO2(1.42 wt%) sample. The Pt white line peak intensity of the sample Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) is higher than that of the reference Pt foil, and lower than that of PtO2, indicating that single Pt atoms of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) carries positive charge, and the valence state is between 0 and +4. The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%), together with that of Pt foil and PtO2, was also analyzed as shown in Fig. 1g. It shows that the prepared samples displayed a major peak at 1.69 Å, which can be assigned to Pt coordinated with non-metallic elements [26]. Compared with Pt foil, no Pt–Pt coordination peak around 2.63 Å was observed, indicating atomic dispersion of Pt sites. To better understand the local geometry of Pt, EXAFS fitting was applied through Athena and Artemis software (Fig. S13) [27]. The fitting results showed that Pt single atoms are mix-coordinated by O and Cl atoms (Table S4), which indicates that Pt atoms are stabilized by O atoms through the formation of the Pt-O-Ti structure due to the strong metal-support interaction between Pt atoms and TiO2. Part Cl atoms of [PtCl6]2− are retained around Pt, which indicates that Pt atoms are anchored on TiO2 surface, rather not embedded inside. In order to confirm the chemical state of corresponding elements on the catalyst surface, the sample was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 2 a–c. In the XPS spectrum of Pt 4f (Fig. 2c), the peaks with binding energies of 72.40 eV and 75.75 eV can be assigned to Ptδ+ 4f7/2 and Ptδ+ 4f5/2 (δ ≈ 2), which shift 1.5 eV towards high energy compared to those at 70.90 eV and 74.25 eV corresponding to metallic state of Pt0 4f [13]. This is consistent with the result of XANES, further verifying that Pt4+ in the [PtCl6]2− anions was anchored and reduced to Ptδ+ (δ ≈ 2) through electron transfer between Pt4+ and Ti3+ once contacted with Ti2O3. The strong metal-support interaction was formed during this process. From the Ti 2p spectrum shown in Fig. 2a, it is clear that Ti3+ (red line) and Ti4+ (yellow line) species are present in R-TiO2 and Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) [28]. However, the situation is much different from the commercial TiO2 (TiO2-c) where there is no Ti3+ signal. The ratio of Ti3+/(Ti3+ + Ti4+) in each catalyst was semiquantitatively calculated by fitting the peak area to the corresponding component in the XPS spectrum, which usually reflects the oxygen vacancy (Ov) content of the catalyst [29]. The content was determined to be 34 % in R-TiO2 and 13 % in Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%), respectively, indicating that the Ov decrease with the introduction of Pt metal sites, and R-TiO2 and Pt1/R-TiO2 contain more Ov than the TiO2-c. Similar conclusion was also drawn from the O 1s XPS spectrum in Fig. 2b, where the two peaks at the binding energies of 529.65 eV (blue line) and 531.35 eV (red line) correspond to the crystal lattice oxygen (OL) and oxygen atoms near OV [30,31], respectively. The content of Ov followed the order R-TiO2 > Pt1/ R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) > TiO2-c. These results indicate that the Pt SACs supported on TiO2 with Ov was obtained by the new strategy reported here. To confirm the existence of crystal Ov and Ti3+ defects, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was conducted. The signals with g factors of 2.22 and 2.06 are attributed to hole-trapped Ov defect [32,33], while that with g = 1.96 is attributed to electron-trapped Ti3+ defect [33,34]. As displayed in Fig. 2d, the TiO2-c exhibits very weak signal intensity of Ov, while much stronger defect signals have been observed in R-TiO2 and Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%). Noteworthily, comparing Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) with R-TiO2, Ti3+ defect at the g value of 1.96 is enhanced, but Ov defect at the g value of 2.22 almost disappears. This result can be explained by the fact that the loading of Pt single atoms on the TiO2 surface makes much change of surface structure due to the formation of strong metal-support interaction and Pt-O-Ti atomic structure, as reflected from EPR spectroscopy. These results are consistent with XPS and XAFs studies. Notably, the content of Ov quantitative analyzed by EPR (Table S3) followed the same order with XPS results as shown in Table S5. 3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances The above results demonstrate that the high loading Pt SACs with Ov defects were synthesized, and the single atomic Pt was anchored on TiO2 and reduced through electron transfer between Pt4+ and Ti3+, thereby leading to the formation of strong metal-support interaction. According to the report in literature [35], the existence of Ov can reverse the charge transfer between Pt and the support TiO2, and results in electron richness on Pt atoms and downshift of d-bond for favorable desorption of H* intermediate, which promotes the hydrogen spillover and eventually H2 production [24]. Additionally, Ov could act as the electron-donor dopant in n-type semiconductor to increase the carrier concentration and boost its conductivity [36]. Encouraged by these considerations, the Pt1/TiO2 was applied in photocatalytic water splitting into H2 to test its catalytic performance. For the sake of convenience, the rutile and anatase TiO2 supported catalysts Pt1/TiO2 with 0.67 wt% and 0.88 wt% of Pt loadings were denoted as Pt1/R-TiO2 (0.67 wt%) and Pt1/A-TiO2 (0.88 wt%), respectively. It is clear that Pt1/R-TiO2 (0.67 wt%) exhibits an excellent activity with hydrogen production rate of 70875 µmol g−1 h−1, while Pt1/A-TiO2(0.88 wt%) presents a hydrogen production rate of 40478 µmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 3 a). Elevating Pt loading on rutile TiO2 to 1.42 wt%, hydrogen production rate of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) increases to 95180 µmol g−1 h−1. However, further increase of Pt loading on R-TiO2 slightly decreases the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the commercial TiO2, denoted as PtNP/TiO2, was also prepared and characterized (Fig. S12, 14), and the H2 evolution rate was found to be 4300 μmol g−1 h−1, which was much less than that of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%). This result strongly indicates the importance of highly dispersed single metal atoms to enhance the utilization efficiency of precious noble metals. For comparison, the pristine commercial rutile TiO2 and the prepared R-TiO2 with Ov defects were also examined, and the H2 evolution rate was 291 μmol g−1 h−1 and 1390 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. This result indicated in part that the existence of Ov defect can promote the H2 evolution in fact, in order to indicate important role of Ov defect in our catalyst, Pt SACs supported on TiO2 without Ov should be synthesized and tested, however, hard to obtained. Furthermore, the cyclic tests of the single atom catalysts were performed to assess the photocatalytic durability. As shown in Finger 3b, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of Pt1/R-TiO2 (1.42 wt%) maintains at around 95,000 after 10 cycles, which reflects the excellent catalystic stability of the catalyst. However, the Pt SA would agglomeratre into Pt particles about 2 nm during the reaction process as shown in Fig. S19. We will continue to conduct research on this matter, hoping to prevent the occurrence of its aggregation in the future, so as to further improve the stability of the catalyst. The photophysical properties of the samples were investigated by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 3c) to study the light-harvesting capability and understand the influence of single Pt atom loading on the intrinsic photocatalytic properties of the TiO2. It was found that compared with the commercial rutile TiO2-c, the UV absorption (<400 nm) strength of our prepared R-TiO2 is enhanced remarkably, although the absorption range only broadens slightly. However, after loading Pt SACs on R-TiO2, not only UV absorption (<400 nm) strength is enhanced, but also a shoulder peak appears at the low-energy side in the visible light range (>400 nm). These results imply that the Ov defects and the Pt SACs synergistically boost light absorption. Compared with Pt1/R-TiO2, the absorption strength and range of Pt1/R-TiO2(2.00 wt%) decreases due to the possible aggregation of Pt atoms, which was in keep with the decreased catalysic activity observed in H2 evolution reaction. Additionally, transient photocurrent density was also determined to investigate the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron and holes. As shown in Fig. S20a, Pt1/R-TiO2 displays the strongest photocurrent intensity, and the trend is as follows: Pt1/R-TiO2 > R-TiO2 > TiO2-c, implying that both the Pt single atoms and the Ov defects play important roles in accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron and holes. In addition, the photocurrent shows a good reproducibility with the light off and on, which is in agreement with their stability of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results in Fig. S20b imply that Pt1/R-TiO2 show the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct), indicating that Pt1/R-TiO2 has a higher overall electronic conductivity to achieve a high current density [37]. 3.3 Mechanism investigation In order to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism for H2 production, DFT calculations were conducted. According to literatures [38,39], the existence of Pt-O-Ti structure would promote the formation of Ov at atomic interfaces during reaction process, and thus enhanced HER activity. We studied Pt single atoms supported on TiO2 (101) lattice plane with 2 O and 4 Cl mixed coordination environment based on experimental observations (Fig. S21), and calculated the rate limiting overpotentials of HER by the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) method developed by Nørskov et al. [40–43]. The detailed computational procedures were given in the section of experiments. The coordination Cl species sequentially desorbed from the Pt atoms during the reaction process [21], meanwhile, the formation energy of interfical Ov gradually diminishes (Fig. 4 a). The coordination number of Cl decrease to 1 as PtCl mode state exhibits the lowest energy for interfical Ov formation, making it the most favorable state for the generation of Pt-O-Ti3+. In this coordination mode, Pt forms stable chemical bonds with the TiO2 surface, which enhances the overall stability of the catalyst. Fig. 4b illustrates that the presence of interfical Ov (ΔG = 0.57 eV) promotes the H2 evolution, which is more facile compared to the absence of interfical Ov (ΔG = −1.21 eV). This phenomenon is attributed to the excessive adsorption strength towards hydrogen atom (H) on the catalyst surface without Ov. The high adsorption strength impedes the progress of the H2 evolution, making it challenging to proceed. In Fig. 4c and d, the density of states for H adsorption on the catalyst with and without interfical Ov was depicted. Notably, Fig. 4c demonstrates a pronounced coupling between Pt and H states near the Fermi level. This strong coupling leads to a substantial H adsorption energy, which acts as a hindrance to the H2 evolution. Conversely, in Fig. 4d, the interaction between Pt and H is weakened due to the presence of interfical Ov. This weakened interaction facilitates the H2 evolution by reducing the adsorption energy of H species on the catalyst surface. These DFT calculation results demonstrate the importance of strong metal support interaction and high dispersion of Pt single atoms in promoting the hydrogen evolution. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a new strategy was proposed for constructing atomically dispersed noble metals on TiO2 with multiple Ov by using Ti2O3 as the precursor of TiO2 support, where Ti3+ of Ti2O3 was used as “traps” to anchor and then reduce diverse metal atoms through electron transfer. Thus, high temperature, high pressure, harmful reagents/solvents and complex processes were avoided, and the loading of metal atoms was easy controllable because of the existence of the large number of “traps”. This strategy had good universality and could be applied in the synthesis of different single metal atoms (Pt, Ru, Au, Pd, Ag) supported on diverse phases of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, metastable and mixed counterpart). It was found that the as-obtained Pt1/TiO2 (1.42 wt%) SAC exhibits impressive performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with H2 evolution rate up to 95,180 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 22 folds higher than that of PtNP/TiO2 and surpasses the best result of SACs supported on TiO2 reported up to now. Furthermore, the photocatalyst showed remarkable stability and recycling performance, the H2 evolution rate of Pt1/R-TiO2(1.42) maintains at around 95,000 after 10 cycles. It was revealed that the strong metal-support interaction facilitates the diffusion of oxygen atoms and forms interficial Ov, thus promoting the formation of the Pt-O-Ti3+ atomic interfaces, which was used to act as true active center and significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in H2 evolution performance. This work opens a new avenue for the simple and versatile preparation of single-atom catalysts on TiO2 for highly efficient H2 evolution.

        "dc:description": "Single atom catalysts (SACs) supported on metal oxide are usually prepared at high temperature, high pressure, and complex process. Herein, a new strategy is developed to prepare SACs anchored on vacancy-rich TiO2 using Ti2O3 as the support precursor under mild conditions, where Ti3+ on Ti2O3 surface acts as “traps” to capture and then reduce metal ions through electron transfer without using reducing agents. This approach is universally applicable for different single metal atoms supported on diverse phases of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, metastable and mixed counterpart). The as-obtained Pt1/TiO2 with controllable Pt loading and multiple oxygen vacancies (Ov) exhibits excellent activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution. At optimal conditions, the H2 evolution rate is up to 95,180 μmol g−1 h−1, which is the highest for TiO2 supported SACs reported.",
