However, the anchoring sites for single-atoms and their catalytic performance towards acetylene hydrochlorination still needs a comprehensive investigation. The boron and nitrogen-vacancy in hBN not only stabilizes Au but can also effectively tune its electronic structure. The single-atom Au has charged negatively and positively on hBN with the formation nitrogen (hBNv) and boron (hBvN) vacancy, respectively. The electronic structure analysis, MD simulations, phonon band structure, and migration barrier uncovered the stability of Au supported on hBN. The reaction proceeded either with Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism, starting with C2H2 adsorption after that HCl activation, product formation, or with Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) method, starting with co-adsorption of C2H2 and HCl. The L-H mechanism results in a smaller reaction barrier of 0.90 and 1.15 eV compared to the counterpart E-R mechanism with a barrier of 1.14 and 1.25 eV for Au/hBNv and Au/hBvN respectively. Moreover, both Au in cation and anion state can efficiently catalyze acetylene hydrochlorination with a competing energy barrier. Overall, current research gives a comprehensive explanation of the catalytic properties of hBN-based single-atom Au catalyst. Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract Defected boron nitride can tune the electronic structure of Au and both Au cation and anion shows comparable performance towards acetylene hydrochlorination. KEYWORDS Defects hexagonal boron nitride single Au catalyst acetylene hydrochlorination DFT 1 Introduction Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is obtained from vinyl chloride after polymerization and it is an important chemical for engineering plastics production [1-5]. Furthermore, acetylene hydrochlorination is a commonly used catalytic route to obtain vinyl chloride. The most common commercial catalyst used for acetylene hydrochlorination is mercury chloride. However, mercury is very toxic and dangerous to the environment and human health [1-3]. Moreover, the use of mercury catalysts in PVC industry has been banned in the Minamata accord signed in Japan [6-8]. Consequently, it is an important task to explore the most efficient catalyst alternative to mercury catalysts. Experimental studies proposed some supported transition metals such as Ru, Au, and Cu, which can effectively catalyze acetylene hydrochlorination [3, 8-12]. Amongst them, Au-based catalysts show superior performance during acetylene hydrochlorination reaction [3, 8, 13]. In very recent research, Hutchings et al. fabricated an extremely active Au cation catalyst on the surface of carbon [8]. They also, confirm that single site Au cation is the most active site during the process of VCM production whereas the redox coupling of Au(I) and Au(III) is designated to be responsible for the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, supported single-atom Au in cation states have been used for several other chemical reactions [8, 14-20]. However, experimental study mostly emphasizes the chemical conversion of acetylene, and several aspects associated with support effects and reaction mechanisms are still unclear. Whereas, computational studies are helpful to further understand the basic process concerning reaction mechanism, the structures of catalysts, and the role of catalyst supports. To date, numerous SACs have been experimentally fabricated on the surface of various two-dimensional (2D) materials, for example, graphene, graphdiyne, and MOS2 which deliver remarkable catalytic performance towards different reactions [21-24]. Therefore, not only the SACs but also the choice of support is important, which not only behaves as a stable anchoring site for SACs but also can tune its catalytic performance. 2D materials such as graphene, graphdiyne, and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are highly promising support to fabricate SACs for several catalytic reactions, such as CO-oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and acetylene hydrochlorination and so on [20, 25-27]. Moreover, the properties of 2D materials can be improved by doping or creating defects [25, 27-30]. In fact, atomic vacancy defects in 2D materials have been demonstrated to be the most active sites for high-performance SACs [25, 27, 28, 30]. For instance, due to its two-dimensional structure hBN can be easily functionalized to bear active sites for anchoring SACs with good dispersion and maximum utilization of the single atoms [25, 27, 30]. In this study, the first-principles DFT calculations are executed to systematically explore the potential of defected hBN as a SACs support for Au atom. The purpose of our current research is to find out an effective and stable single-atom Au catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination and provide a guideline for experimentalists. To certify the stability of single atom Au on the hBN surface we propose criteria that “The adsorption energy of an isolated SAC on the support should be larger than the cohesive energy of its bulk counterpart, ensuring a firm anchor of the SACs on the support rather than agglomerating into clusters”. Based on this criteria, we predict that Au-supported defected hBN is a suitable and stable catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination. The nitrogen and boron vacancy in hBN not only stabilize Au but also effectively tune its electronic structure which brings negative and positive charges on Au. A comprehensive description of the minimum energy path is illustrated which sheds light on the mechanism. From the reaction pathways analysis, it is revealed that Au in cation and anion state can effectively catalyze acetylene hydrochlorination with a comparable energy barrier. Overall, current research gives a detailed description of the catalytic properties of hBN-based single-atom Au catalyst. 2 Computational setup The spin-polarized DFT calculations have been carried out by using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [31] for the exchange-correlation potentials, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [32-34]. A 3 × 3 × 1 k-points mesh and 400 eV energy cutoff were used for structure relaxation. The empirical correction in Grimme's method (DFT+D3) was adopted to describe van der Waals interaction [35]. The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated using the following equation: (1) E ads = E ad − state − ( E reactants + E hBN ) Where Ead-state, EhBN, and Ereactant are the total energies of the hBN with the reactant adsorption, the isolated hBN, and the free single-atom Au, C2H2, and HCl, respectively. Similarly, we calculated the cohesive energy (Ecoh) of bulk metal systems with the following formula: (2) E coh = E tot ( Au ) − E tot ( bulk metal ) / N According to equations (1) and (2), the negative values of Eads and Ecoh represent an exothermic process and vice versa. The current simulation was carried out for a 4 × 4 supercell hBN with 50 atoms. The hBN supercell is hexagonal 12.76 × 12.76 × 7.7 Å3 with periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions are employed to represent an infinite sheet. The vacuum thickness was set to be 12 Å in the z-direction to minimize the interaction between periodic interlayer interactions. The total energy was converged to an accuracy of 1 × 10−6 eV to obtain accurate forces, and a force tolerance of 0.05 eV/Å was applied in the structure optimization. The thermal stability of Au supported on hBN was examined by the first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 300, 700, and 1000 K with a time step of 1 fs for 5 ps. Phonon calculations were performed using the phonopy code. The reaction pathways and energy barriers for acetylene hydrochlorination reaction were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method [36]. Bader charge calculation was performed to analyze the charge population and charge transfer [37, 38]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Adsorption of single-atom Au on pristine and defected hBN In this work, we have considered pristine and monovacancy (nitrogen and boron) defected hBN as a single-atom Au support shown in Fig. 1 . First of all, we have evaluated the stabilities of single-atom Au on pristine and defective hBN by adsorption energy calculation, in order to screen stable single-atom Au catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination. Explicit criteria for the identifg a stable single-atom Au catalyst is: “The adsorption energy of an isolated SAC on the support should be larger than the cohesive energy of its bulk counterpart, confirming a firm anchor of the SACs on the support rather than agglomerating into clusters [39, 40]” Several adsorption sites on hBN surface were considered for single-atom Au adsorption, however, Au strongly adsorbed on defective site. The adsorption energy of single-atom Au depends on adsorption sites and has stronger adsorption energy at defective sites as compared to the pristine ones as shown in Table 1 . Furthermore, Au-supported hBvN and hBNv satisfy the proposed criteria, and its adsorption energy is greater than the cohesive energy of their corresponding bulk metal atom while Au supported on pristine hBN fails to meet the proposed criteria (compare adsorption energy values in Table 1). Previous reports show that the adsorption energy of a single metal atom on support should be lower than its bulk cohesive energies, otherwise there is a chance of atomic agglomeration to form a metallic cluster [41, 42]” i.e.; if Ediff is positive. From Table 1 we can see that Au supported hBvN has stronger adsorption energy with high negative Ediff values compared to Au supported hBNv. The Au and B bond lengths in Au/hBNv are in the range of 2.04-2.07Å while Au and N in Au hBvN are in the range of 2.07-2.3 Å. The bond distance is in the range of the sum of the covalent radius of Au and N and B vacancies defects site which suggests that a strong covalent bond is made between Au and defective sites which means that Au adsorbed on hBvN and hBNv satisfies the required criteria and therefore these two sites are highly favorble for single-atom Au catalyst in thermodynamics. The electron localization function (ELF) further confirms strong bonding between Au atom and defective site (Fig. 2 c and d). Moreover, the structure stabilities of Au supported on hBvN and HBNv are examined via MD simulations at a temperature of 300, 500 and 1000 K. The results show that the atomic structures of Au supported on hBvN and hBNv are preserved very well after 5 ps MD simulation at 300 and 700 K while, showing slight distortion at 1000 K as shown in Figure S1-S2. Next, we plot the phonon band dispersions of the Au adsorbed pristine and vacancy mediated hBN to confirm their vibrational stability. As reported for other materials, the absence of negative modes of vibration is a direct evidence of vibrational stability of material as reported for M2X monolayers [43] , MoC, WC, WS, and WSe [44], and many others in literature [45]. As can be seen in Fig. 3 (a) the phonon band structure of Au adsorbed on pristine hBN has negative frequency meaning that Au adsorption on pristine hBN is dynamically unstable. In case of the Au adsorption on vacany mediated hBN no negative vibration mode is observed (see Fig. 3(b, c) which confirms their dynamic stability. It is also consistent with the adsorption energies given in Table 1. By calculating the migration barrier, we further studied the possible surface diffusion of Au on hBN surface. The activation barriers were calculated to be 3.5, and 3.11 eV for the surface migration of Au from the vacancy site to the nearest hallow site of hBvN and Au/hBNv, respectively. Such a high energy barrier (3.11 and 3.50 eV) excludes the vibility of atomic agglomeration of Au on hBvN and Au/hBNv. Therefore, it is also highly possible to achieve proper single-atom Au catalyst in kinetics for these two cases, based on the MD simulation, phonon band dispersions, and diffusion barrier calculation. Remarkably, N and B vacancy in hBN can fine-tune the electronic structure of single-atom Au and bring negative and positive charges on Au respectively. The strong interaction and opposite effect of charge states of Au attached with nitrogen and boron are further confirmed via charge density difference plot shown in Fig. 2 (a, b), which demonstrate that charge is transferred to and from Au catalyst to hBN and accumulated around single-atom Au and defective sites. This observation also suggests that a covalent bond is formed between single-atom Au and surrounding nitrogen and boron atoms. The Au supported on hBvN and hBNv have positive and negative charges of 0.66, and -0.50 |e|, respectively, based on the Bader charge analysis which is consistent with charge density difference analysis. The charge transferred between single-atom Au and defected hBN support results in the good catalytic activity of single-atom Au towards reactants (C2H2 and HCl) adsorption which will discuss in the following section. 3.2 Adsorption of reactants (C2H2 and HCl) on Au supported defected hBN It has been proven that the interaction between SAC and reactant plays a central role in its catalytic property [16, 20, 46]. Hence, we first study the adsorption of relevant reactants (C2H2 and HCl) on Au/hBvN and Au/hBNv. Fig. 4 shows the optimized structures of C2H2 and HCl on Au/hBvN and Au/hBNv. The corresponding adsorption energies and the Bader charges are summarized in Table 2 . C2H2 adsorbed strongly than HCl on both single Au anion and cation as clear from Table 2. Furthermore, the adsorption energy of C2H2 is larger at Au/hBvN (-0.93 eV) than Au/hBNv (-0.69 eV) site as shown in Table 2. The adsorbed C2H2 not only differs from a linear configuration in the gas phase but also CC bond is stretched from 0.24 Å (isolated C2H2) to 0.3 and 0.29 Å respectively at Au/hBvN and Au/hBNv sites. Both suggests that C2H2 molecule is activated after adsorption, consistent with prior studies [13, 47-51]. It is also clear from Table 2 that about 0.38 and 0.02 |e| charge transfers to C2H2 from single atom Au which is consistent with an adsorption energy of C2H2. It is also understandable that Au in cation can capture more electron from C2H2 compare to Au anion as it is clear from Table 2 Furthermore, it is essential to analyze the charge states of Au after C2H2 adsorption. Our calculation demonstrates that Au maintains its charge states with the positive charge on hBvN site and a negative charge at hBNv sites, respectively, as shown in Figure S3, and is consistent with the charge density plot analysis shown in Figure S4. Furthermore, the strong and weak adsorption of C2H2 and HCl is also justified by ELF analysis shown in Figure S5. The above discussion concluded that there is a strong interaction between support defective sites, the single-atom Au catalyst, and reactants adsorption. Therefore, the defective sites in support can tune the properties of single-atom Au catalyst and will affect its interactions with the reactants. 3.3 Reaction mechanism of acetylene hydrochlorination on Au/hBN It has been proven that acetylene hydrochlorination can proceed either through an Eley–Rideal (E-R) like mechanism or Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) like mechanism [13, 20, 50, 52]. Therefore in the present study we study both E-R and L-H mechanisms for acetylene hydrochlorination. We first examine E-R like mechanism for acetylene hydrochlorination, where C2H2 chemically adsorb on the surface of Au (step “B” in Fig. 5 ) followed by HCl attacking at adsorbed C2H2 (C), then the activation of HCl (D), the product vinyl-chloride formation and desorption (E, F, and G). The schematic energy profile of acetylene hydrochlorination reaction with the corresponding optimized structure along the reaction pathway is shown in Fig. 5. In the first step of the reaction process, C2H2 readily adsorbed on the surface of single-atom Au which is an exothermic and barrier-less process. Similarly, in the next step (state C) HCl, attacks on adsorbed C2H2, which is also an exothermic process. In the next step (TS1 (D)) of this pathway, the HCl molecule is first broken and then separately approach to adsorb C2H2. The distance between carbon atom (C) in C2H2 and H, Cl is listed in Table S1. The reaction barrier at TS1 was calculated to be 1.25, and 1.14 eV respectively for Au/hBvN and Au/hBNv respectively. After passing TS1, vinyl chloride is formed. The desorption of vinyl chloride is also an essential step to complete the catalytic cycle and recover the active site. It is investigated that vinyl chloride desorption needs to surmount a barrier of 0.70, and 0.63 eV for Au/hBvN and Au/hBNv respectively as indicated at TS2. Furthermore, a redox cycle has been observed for single-atom Au catalyst along the E-R reaction path as clear from Fig. 6. The charge on a single Au atom increases via oxidation to state D on the reaction path. After state D, the Au atom gradually returns to its original charge state via a reduction. Hence, Au supported on defective hBN surface has an oxidation-reduction cycle during acetylene hydrochlorination reaction which is consistent with previous literature studies reported on single Au site catalyst [8, 13]. The stronger adsorption of C2H2 on Au/hBvN surface (Table 2) leads to a comparatively larger energy barrier (1.25 eV) than Au/hBNv surface (1.14 eV) as can be seen in Fig. 5. Therefore, for stronger adsorption sites of C2H2, it is hard for HCl to reach the active site and be activated. Therefore, a reasonable competency between C2H2 adsorption and HCl activation is vital to easily carry out acetylene hydrochlorination. The equivalent adsorption energy of HCl and C2H2 at Au/hBNv (Table 2) is a reminder that Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism, which has been seldom discussed so far, may also be applicable. It has been reported that 2D materials can accommodate high loads of single atoms up to 12 wt % [53]. Based on this justification, two Au atoms are deposited on Au/hBNv. Moreover, to relate the result on defective sites, Au/hBvN is also taken into account for L-H mechanism as shown in step A in Fig. 7 . The distance between two Au atoms adsorbed on hBNv and hBvN surfaces is ~ 6.6 and ~ 6.8 Å respectively, suggesting, both Au atoms still keep single atom characteristics. In L-H mechanism C2H2 and HCl simultaneously adsorbed the surface of two Au atoms supported on hBNv and hBvN (Fig. 7, step B) with an exothermic adsorption energy of -1.09 and -1.42 eV respectively. In L-H and E-R mechanism C2H2 has a similar adsorbed configuration. However, adsorbed HCl molecule in L-H mechanism was significantly stretched to a bond distance of ~2.6 Å. In the next step (C) the HCl molecule is distracted from Au surface and approaching adsorbed C2H2. This step is endothermic and required overcoming a barrier of 0.90 and 1.15 eV (TS1 in Fig. 7) which is comparatively smaller than that of E-R mechanism shown in Fig. 5. At TS1, the bond between H and Cl in HCl molecule is elongated from ~1.29 Å to ~2.39 Å which is completely broken. The hydrogen from HCl molecule is binding with the carbon atom of C2H2. The Cl atom from dissociated HCl molecule approached to another carbon atom of C2H2 and the desired product, vinyl chloride, is formed at the surface of Au as shown in Fig. 7 (state D). In the last step of L-H pathway, vinyl chloride is desorbed from the surface of Au/hBNv and Au/hBvN by overcoming an energy barrier of 0.57 and 0.69 eV respectively as shown in step E in Fig. 7. Overall, the L-H mechanism for acetylene hydrochlorination on Au/hBNv and Au/hBvN surfaces was verified with a comparatively lower energy barrier than E-R mechanism. Similarly, the comparison between the L-H and E-R mechanism showed that the cooperation between two individual Au could lead to improved performance at the single site which exemplifies the effects of synergy between single atom catalysts [54-56]. 4 Conclusion In current research, for the first time, the potential of single-atoms Au on supported pristine and defected hBN towards acetylene hydrochlorination has been evaluated using first-principles calculations. The support effect has been screened according to the stability of a single-atom Au. Our calculation revealed that Au supported on defected hBN has stronger adsorption energy than the cohesive energy of their corresponding metal in bulk. Therefore, we select Au-supported on defected hBN for the further catalytic reaction. The nitrogen and boron vacancy in hBN not only stabilize Au but also efficiently tune its electronic structure. The single-atom Au has negatively and positively charged on hBNv and hBvN respectively. Our calculations revealed that Au supported on defective hBN with boron monovacancy (Au/hBvN) and nitrogen monovacancy (Au/hBNv) are stable both in the thermodynamics and the kinetics by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, migration barrier calculation, and electronic structure analysis. The reaction proceeded either through an E-R like mechanism which started with C2H2 adsorption after that HCl activation, product formation, or with L-H like mechanism which initiated with co-adsorption of C2H2 and HCl. The LH mechanism has a smaller reaction barrier 0.90 and 1.15 eV than the counterpart of ER mechanism 1.14 and 1.25 eV for Au/hBNv and Au/hBvN respectively. From the reaction pathways analysis, it is found that Au in cation and anion state can effectively catalyze acetylene hydrochlorination with a comparable energy barrier. Moreover, a redox cycle for supported single-atom Au was observed during the reaction path. Overall, current research gives a detailed explanation of the catalytic properties of hBN-based single-atom Au catalyst. Author contributions The manuscript is written by the first author.

        "dc:description": "Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with defects shows remarkable performance as catalyst support for single-atom stabilization in several catalytic reactions, such as CO oxidation, N2 fixation, and ORR. However, the anchoring sites for single-atoms and their catalytic performance towards acetylene hydrochlorination still needs a comprehensive investigation. The boron and nitrogen-vacancy in hBN not only stabilizes Au but can also effectively tune its electronic structure. The single-atom Au has charged negatively and positively on hBN with the formation nitrogen (hBNv) and boron (hBvN) vacancy, respectively. The electronic structure analysis, MD simulations, phonon band structure, and migration barrier uncovered the stability of Au supported on hBN. The reaction proceeded either with Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism, starting with C2H2 adsorption after that HCl activation, product formation, or with Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L-H) method, starting with co-adsorption of C2H2 and HCl. The L-H mechanism results in a smaller reaction barrier of 0.90 and 1.15 eV compared to the counterpart E-R mechanism with a barrier of 1.14 and 1.25 eV for Au/hBNv and Au/hBvN respectively. Moreover, both Au in cation and anion state can efficiently catalyze acetylene hydrochlorination with a competing energy barrier. Overall, current research gives a comprehensive explanation of the catalytic properties of hBN-based single-atom Au catalyst.",
