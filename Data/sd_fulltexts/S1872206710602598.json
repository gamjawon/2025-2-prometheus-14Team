DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(10)60259-8 Sulfur Resistance and Activity of Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 Diesel Oxidation Catalysts ZHONG Fulan, ZHONG Yujiao, XIAO Yihong, CAI Guohui, ZHENG Yong, WEI Kemei* National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: Three Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 diesel oxidation catalysts were prepared by two different routes and characterized by X-ray diffrac- tion, N 2 adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in- frared spectroscopy. The synthesis procedure affected the structure, texture, sulfur resistance, and catalytic activity of the catalysts. Sulfur poisoning increased the light-off temperature of all the catalysts, but the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalyst prepared by depositing ZrO 2 and La 2 O 3 on the surface of CeO 2 nanoparticles exhibited better sulfur tolerance and catalytic activity with simulated diesel emission due to the high dispersion of Pt on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 oxide with a Zr-rich surface. Key words: ceria; zirconia; lanthana; platinum; deposition-precipitation; sulfur-poisoning; diesel exhaust purification Diesel engines are widely used in automotive vehicles be- cause of their high fuel efficiency and low NO x production as compared to gasoline engines [1]. The lean combustion of diesel engine contributes to good fuel economy, but it also results in a low emission temperature. This is bad for the elimination of diesel pollutant gases, which are mainly carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (PM) that contains elemental carbon (ca. 31%), sulphates and moisture (ca. 14%), unburnt fuel (ca. 7%), lubricant oil (ca. 40%), and metals [2]. Among several post-treatment technologies used for diesel exhaust gases, catalytic oxidation by diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) working in excess oxygen is a promising solution [3â€“6]. However, many studies [7â€“9] have shown that although both Pd and Pt-based DOCs exhibit high initial ac- tivity, they are easily deactivated. Sulfur or impurity poisoning of the catalysts has been proposed in previous studies [10â€“13]. Therefore, improving the sulfur tolerance of DOCs is of great concern. The choice of the support is important for preparing highly efficient and sulfur-tolerant DOCs. Compared to inert catalyst supports such as Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 , ceria-based materials can create â€œactive oxygenâ€� [14], and thus reduce the light-off temperature of contaminant oxidation over DOCs. A large number of studies have shown that the use of CeO 2 -based materials as the support for Pt-based DOCs accelerated the oxidation rate of diesel soot due to the high availability of surface oxygen and high surface reducibility [10,15,16], but these catalysts were easily sulfated during the removal of the pollutants in diesel exhaust gas since SO 2 was present and blocked active sites. Bazin et al. [17] reported that the addi- tion of zirconia to ceria limited sulfiding in the bulk of the oxide, and thereby reduced the total sulfur uptake. Rohart et al. [18] also reported that the quantity of sulfate adsorption on ceria-rich oxide was more than on zirconia-rich oxides as a result of strong surface basicity. This suggested that the sulfur resistance of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 materials can be tuned by modifying the surface composition. It is well-known that the preparation method and the CeO 2 component of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 materials can give different crystal- line phases including three stable phases (monoclinic (m), tetragonal (t), cubic (c)), and two metastable phases (tÆ�, tÆŽ) [10,19], and also give significant differences in thermal, chemical, and redox properties. Our previous study [20] showed that the incorporation of La 2 O 3 into CeO 2 -ZrO 2 oxide can effectively improve its thermal and chemical properties, which are key parameters that determine the potential applica- tion of CeO 2 -ZrO 2 materials in the removal of pollutants in exhaust gases from vehicles. In the present work, thermally ZHONG Fulan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1469â€“1476 stable CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 ternary oxides were first prepared using two frequently used synthesis routes for fabricating heterogeneous catalysts, that is, deposition-precipitation and co-precipitation methods. These were used as the support of Pt-based DOCs for the simultaneous oxidation of CO and C 3 H 6 . The structure, texture, and surface properties of the catalysts were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and infrared (IR) spec- troscopy. The emphasis was on the comparison of the sulfur resistance of the catalysts prepared by the two methods in order to develop practical CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -based DOCs with a low light-off temperature. 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 materials were prepared by two methods: deposition-precipitation and co-precipitation. For deposition-precipitation method, the required amount of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O was first calcined at 573 K for 4 h to obtain CeO 2 particles with a high surface area. A slurry was obtained by ball-milling the CeO 2 with some deionized water for several hours. The required amount of ammonia solution was added into the slurry. A stoichiometric mixture of ZrOCl 2 Â·8H 2 O and La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O solutions (Ce:Zr:La = 5:4:1, molar ratio) was used to deposit the CeO 2 particles. The pH of solution was controlled at 9.0. The resulting precipitates were filtered, washed with distilled water, dried, and calcined at 873 K for 4 h in air. The resulting CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 was denoted as A. After ball-milling the ZrO 2 particles with an amount of de- ionized water for several hours, the required amount of am- monia solution was added into the slurry. A stoichiometric mixture of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O and La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O solutions was used to deposit the milled ZrO 2 particles. The pH of solution was controlled at 9.0. The resulting precipitates were filtered, washed with distilled water, dried, and calcined at 873 K for 4 h in air. The CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 oxide obtained with the same composition as A was denoted as B. The ZrO 2 particles were prepared by precipitation with ammonia from a solution of ZrOCl 2 Â·8H 2 O, which was followed by washing, drying at 383 K for 15 h, and calcination at 823 K for 4 h. For co-precipitation method, the mixed aqueous solution of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O, ZrOCl 2 Â·8H 2 O, and La(NO 3 ) 3 Â·6H 2 O was quickly dropped into ammonia solution and the pH of solution was controlled at 9.0. The precipitate obtained was filtered, washed with distilled water, dried, and calcined at 873 K in air. The resulting CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 oxide was denoted as C (with the same molar composition as A and B). The loading of platinum on the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 oxides was carried out by impregnation using a solution of H 2 PtCl 6 Â·6H 2 O. The resultant solids were calcined at 873 K for 4 h in air. The catalysts obtained were marked as Pt/A, Pt/B, and Pt/C. The Pt/A-S, Pt/B-S, and Pt/C-S denoted the sulfated catalysts. The Pt/A-R, Pt/B-R, and Pt/C-R denoted the regen- erated catalysts. The loading of platinum was determined by a Axios Petro X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. For comparison, the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was also prepared. Al 2 O 3 was obtained by precipitation with the required amount of ammonia and NH 4 HCO 3 from a solution of Al(NO 3 ) 3 Â·9H 2 O, followed by washing, drying for 15 h at 383 K, and calcination at 873 K for 4 h. 1.2 Catalyst characterization XRD data were recorded on a Panalytical Xâ€™Pert Pro dif- fractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA with a step of 0.0167 o at a scanning rate of 10 o /min using Co K Ä® radiation, which was then revised to Cu K Ä® . The specific surface areas and pore size distribution of the samples were determined on a TriStar 3000 apparatus by N 2 adsorption at 77 K. The samples were out- gassed in vacuum at 300 o C for more than 3 h until the residual pressure was less than 1333 Pa before the adsorption. XPS spectra were collected on a VG ESCALAB 250 XPS system with a monochromatized Al K Ä® X-ray source (15 kV, 200 W, 500 È�m, pass energy = 20 eV). All binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The CO-TPD experiments were performed on an AutoChem 2920 instrument by the pulse technique. About 100 mg of samples were placed in a quartz tube and pretreated at 773 K in flowing H 2 for 30 min, then in flowing He for 20 min, and subsequently cooled to room temperature in He. The reduced samples were pulsed with CO at an interval of 3 min until the intensity of the peak was constant. The temperature of the sample was then raised from room temperature to 1123 K at a rate of 10 K/min. The metal dispersion was determined by the amount of CO consumed during the pulse. The desulfiding characteristics were analyzed with a quar- drupole mass spectrometer (Ametek Process Instruments, Model Dycor DM100M). The powder samples were sulfated by exposure to a feed containing 0.04% SO 2 , 13% O 2 , and balance He (feed rate of 200 ml/min) for 30 min at 623 K. The catalysts were then subjected to desulfiding under 10% H 2 -90% He by raising the temperature from 563 to 873 K at a rate of 3 K/min. 1.3 Activity test Catalytic activity tests for the oxidation of CO and C 3 H 6 were carried out on a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. The catalyst (0.1 g) was held in a quartz glass tube reactor (i.d. 10.5 mm) equipped with a temperature-programmed controller. Prior to measurement, the catalyst was pretreated in 1% CO-99% He at 673 K for 0.5 h. For the sulfated sample, the ZHONG Fulan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1469â€“1476 powder samples were sulfated by exposure to a feed contain- ing 0.04% SO 2 , 13% O 2 , and balance He (feed rate of 200 ml/min) for 30 min at 623 K. The amount of SO 2 adsorbed was determined by XRF. The sulfated samples were regener- ated in situ in a H 2 atmosphere at 823 K for 1 h. The reaction gas was a mixture of 0.1% CO, 0.01% C 3 H 6 , 13.5% O 2 , and balance He. The total flow rate of the reaction gas was 200 ml/min (GHSV = 170000 h â€“1 ). The catalytic activity was measured while the temperature was raised from 343 to 513 K at a rate of 10 K/min. CO and C 3 H 6 compositions in the gas were monitored by two gas chromatographs, GC-14C and 9750, equipped with a thermal conduction detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID), respectively. CO conversion = (C CO, inlet â€“ C CO, outlet )/C CO, inlet C 3 H 6 conversion = (C C3H6, inlet â€“ C C3H6, outlet )/C C3H6, inlet where C i, inlet is the concentration of compound i at the reactor inlet and C i, outlet is that at the reactor outlet. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure and texture of Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples before and after sulfur treatment Figure 1 displays the XRD patterns of the Pt/A, Pt/B, Pt/C, Pt/A-S, Pt/B-S, and Pt/C-S samples. All samples did not show any Bragg diffractive peak of metal Pt or Pt oxide. This was because the loading of Pt (0.5 wt% in Table 1) was too low. For the Pt/A sample prepared by the deposition of ZrO 2 and La 2 O 3 on CeO 2 nanoparticles, all the Bragg diffractive peaks were indexed to a mixed tetragonal (JCPDS 38-1436) and cubic (JCPDS 38-1439) phase. Peaks of lanthana and zirconia oxides were not seen, suggesting that La and Zr cations were either incorporated into the ceria lattice or were well dispersed on the ceria surface in the form of amorphous lanthana and zirconia oxides. For the Pt/B sample prepared by the deposition of CeO 2 and La 2 O 3 on ZrO 2 nanoparticles, the main diffraction peaks were indexed as the cubic phase. Some weak impurity peaks indexed as the monoclinic phase of ZrO 2 was detected, indi- cating that ZrO 2 was not fully incorporated into the CeO 2 lat- tice after calcination at 873 K. A fraction of the ZrO 2 existed as a separated monoclinic phase. These results suggested that the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 supports prepared by the deposi- tion-precipitation method were composed of mixed phases, which depended on the deposition procedure. However, the Pt/C sample prepared by co-precipitation had a single cubic fluorite structure, as indicated by the XRD pattern that was very close to that of CeO 2 . Moreover, the lattice parameter (a) value for the Pt/B sample was significantly increased by the doping of La 3+ (ionic radius of La 3+ = 0.116 nm) [21], while the lattice parameter (a) value of the Pt/A sample was comparable with that of CeO 2 (ca. 0.540 nm), suggesting that considerable amounts of Zr 4+ (ionic radius of Zr 4+ = 0.084 nm) [19] were doped into the CeO 2 fluorite lattice in the case of the Pt/A sample. This caused a drastic difference in the surface atomic composition, which was confirmed by XPS results discussed below.

XRD patterns of the non-sulfated and sulfated Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts. ZHONG Fulan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1469â€“1476 After sulfur treatment, we did not observe any modifications of the XRD patterns for the Pt/A-S, Pt/B-S, and Pt/C-S sam- ples. This indicated that the sulfiding did not alter their crys- talline structure. This was possibly because the pretreatment time was relatively short, such that the sulfate accumulated was below the detection limit, or the sulfate formed was well dis- persed on the catalyst surface. However, the sulfiding signifi- cantly changed the texture of the samples, as shown by N 2 adsorption-desorption measurements (Table 1). The BET sur- face area and pore volume of the sulfated samples decreased by 50% and 30%, respectively, implying the bonding of SO 2 on the surface of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 support. It is interesting to note that the texture of the reference catalyst (Pt/Al 2 O 3 ) was not altered by sulfur poisoning due to the high SO 2 adsorption capacity [22]. In addition, the physicochemical properties of Al 2 O 3 were also completely different from those of the CeO 2 -based oxide. The CeO 2 -based oxide was alkaline and exhibited the unique feature of the storage and release of oxygen, which helped the adsorption and oxidation of SO 2 , thus changing the structure. The XRF results showed that the amount of sulfur adsorbed on the Pt/A-S sample was compa- rable to that on Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S, and lower than those of the Pt/B-S and Pt/C-S samples. This indicated that the Pt/A sample had better sulfur resistance. 2.2 Catalytic activity of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 samples Figure 2 shows the conversion curves of CO and C 3 H 6 over the Pt/A, Pt/B, Pt/C, and Pt/Al 2 O 3 before and after sulfur treatment. The Pt/A catalyst exhibited the best activities for both CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation among the catalysts investigated. It gave values of T 50 (384 K for CO conversion and 403 K for C 3 H 6 oxidation), which were lower than those from the Pt/B (407 K for CO conversion and 416 K for C 3 H 6 oxidation) and the Pt/C (398 K for CO conversion and 417 K for C 3 H 6 oxida- tion) catalysts. Overall, the non-sulfated Pt/A was better in oxidation catalytic activity as compared with the commercial Pt/Al 2 O 3 sample (394 K for CO conversion and 403 K for C 3 H 6 oxidation). After sulfur treatment, the light-off tempera- tures of CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation over all the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts were increased significantly, while the Pt/A-S catalyst still exhibited a low light-off tem- perature (423 K for CO conversion and 433 K for C 3 H 6 oxida- tion) comparable to that of Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S (423 K for both CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation), and significantly lower than those over the Pt/B-S (444 K for CO conversion and 465 K for C 3 H 6 oxida- tion) and Pt/C-S (487 K for CO and C 3 H 6 oxidations) cata- lysts. The differences (Ç»T 50 ) of the 50% CO conversion tem- perature for the Pt/Al 2 O 3 , Pt/A, Pt/B, and Pt/C catalysts after and before sulfiding were calculated, and found to increase in the order of Pt/Al 2 O 3 (41 K) < Pt/A (51 K) < Pt/B (73 K) < Pt/C (100 K). These results clearly showed that the Pt/A catalyst had excellent sulfur resistance and activity as compared to the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. We also examined the catalytic activities of all the regener- ated catalysts obtained by in situ H 2 reduction at 823 K.

CO and C 3 H 6 conversion over the non-sulfated (a, d), sulfated (b, e), and regenerated (c, f) catalysts ZHONG Fulan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1469â€“1476 are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f). After the sulfided Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts were regenerated in a H 2 at- mosphere at 823 K for 1 h, the activities of the catalysts for both CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation were improved. The Pt/A-R catalyst showed a light-off temperature of 423 K for the oxi- dation of CO and C 3 H 6 , which was lower than those of the Pt/B-R (443 K) and Pt/C-R (433 K) catalysts. It was interesting to note that the Pt/Al 2 O 3 -R catalyst exhibited poorer activities for the oxidation of CO and C 3 H 6 than the Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S catalyst. Its light-off temperature was instead increased from 423 to 443 K. This may be due to the agglomeration of active Pt atoms at the high reduction temperature. The H 2 reduction at 823 K did not remove sulfur species bonded to Pt sites. This was con- firmed by the TPR-MS results. 2.3 IR spectroscopy To understand the sulfur-poisoning mechanism, we used IR spectroscopy to characterize the sulfated catalysts. It is well-known that SO 2 oxidation on ceria gives rise to two types of sulfate: surface and bulk-like species. The former is char- acterized by IR bands in the 1400â€“1340 cm â€“1 range while the latter has a very broad band near 1200 cm â€“1 [23,24]. As seen in Fig. 3, no absorption band in the region of 1700â€“800 cm â€“1 was observed for all of the non-sulfated Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 sam- ples. However, after sulfiding, a broad absorption band ap- peared at 1160 cm â€“1 , indicating that sulfate existed in the form of bulk-like sulfate species. By comparing the intensity of the 1160 cm â€“1 band, one can find that the amount of bulk sulfate species formed on the Pt/A sample was the least of the three catalysts. This was consistent with the catalytic results reported above. 2.4 XPS analysis Figure 4 shows the XPS results on the chemical states of Pt and S. Table 2 lists the characteristics of the non-sulfated and sulfated Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts deduced from the XPS investigation. There was no difference in the binding energies (BE) of Ce, Zr, La, and O atoms for the Pt/A, Pt/B, and Pt/C samples. The surface atomic ratio of Ce to Zr for the three samples estimated using photoelectron cross-sections calcu- lated by Scofield showed a moderate difference that depended on the synthesis procedure (seen from Table 2). The surface Ce/Zr ratio of Pt/A was smaller than that of Pt/B, which was comparable with that of Pt/C. The Ce/Zr atomic ratios of all samples were lower than their nominal values, and the surface concentration of Zr was higher than its bulk concentration. This showed that Ce, Zr, and La were not uniformly distributed in the oxides. The BE of Pt 4f was between 72.3 to 72.5 eV for the non-sulfated samples, indicating that Pt existed in the form of PtO [25]. But after sulfur treatment, the BE of Pt 2+ was shifted by 0.5 eV towards higher energy, showing a strong electron withdrawing effect derived from the sulfate species revealed by the BE of the S 2p 3/2 at 168.9 eV [26] and the IR results re- ported above. 2.5 TPD and TPR analyses 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 Pt/C-S Pt/B-S Pt/C Pt/B Pt/A-S Pt/A Wavenumber (cm 1 ) SO 2 4 A b s o r b a n c e Fig. 3.

ZHONG Fulan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32: 1469â€“1476 Figure 5(a) shows the CO-TPD profiles of the Pt/A, Pt/B, Pt/C, Pt/A-S, Pt/B-S, and Pt/C-S catalysts. The non-sulfated Pt/A, Pt/B, and Pt/C catalysts showed two broad peaks at 400â€“800 and 800â€“1050 K. The intensity of the first desorption peak decreased in the order of Pt/A > Pt/B > Pt/C, while the second desorption peak increased in intensity in the opposite order. The two broad peaks of the three Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts were ascribed to CO adsorbed on different Pt sites or partially on CeO x . This assignment was based on the CO de- sorption temperatures being comparable to those of the refer- ence catalyst Pt/Al 2 O 3 (Fig. 5(b)) where there were two de- sorption peaks at 624 and 906 K. For Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S, the CO de- sorption temperature was clearly increased by sulfur poisoning. This likely resulted from the agglomeration of Pt atoms or that the Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 formed partially covered Pt particles causing the increase of the CO desorption temperature. Table 1 shows that the dispersion of Pt on CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 decreased in the order of Pt/A > Pt/B > Pt/C. This was the same as with the catalytic activity. After sulfiding, the CO-TPD profiles were two completely separated desorption peaks at low and high temperatures. The intensity of the CO desorption peak at the low temperature for the sulfated catalysts was drastically reduced, indicating that the amount of CO adsorbed on Pt sites decreased due to the poisoning of the Pt surface by sulfur. Moreover, the desorption temperature of CO adsorbed on Pt increased in the order of Pt/A-S < Pt/B-S < Pt/C-S, while the intensity of the CO desorption peak decreased in the order of Pt/A-S > Pt/B-S > Pt/C-S. The TPR results shown in Fig. 6 gave information on the desulfurization characteristics of Pt/A-S, Pt/B-S, Pt/C-S, and Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S. No H 2 S desorption was observed from Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S in the temperature range of 563 to 900 K. This, together with the XRF analysis result, indicated that the sulfur bonded to the Pt sites was irreducible. Compared with the peak intensity of the H 2 S fragment of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts, one can find that the Pt/A-S sample contained the least amount of reducible SO 4 2â€“ . This may be attributed to the different surface Ce/Zr ratios. Because of the strong surface basicity and the unique feature of the storage and release oxygen of CeO 2 , it was more active in the adsorption and oxidation of the acidic SO 2 as compared to ZrO 2 . Thus, a large Ce/Zr ratio indicated more storage capacity of sulfur. The results of the catalytic activity evaluation showed that the regeneration treatment for Table 2 Characteristic parameters from XPS spectra of non-sulfated and sulfated Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts Binding energy (eV) Ce/Zr atomic ratio Sample O 1s Zr 3d 5/2 Ce 3d 5/2 Pt 4f 7/2 S 2p 3/2 Theoretical Experimental Pt/A 528.8, 530.8 181.5 881.3 72.4 â€” 1.25 0.33 Pt/A-S 529.5, 531.7, 532.6 182.1 882.1 72.9 168.7 1.25 0.28 Pt/B 528.8, 530.9 181.5 881.6 72.5 â€” 1.25 0.57 Pt/B-S 529.3, 531.6, 533.8 181.8 882.2 72.9 168.9 1.25 0.66 Pt/C 529.1, 531.1 181.6 881.9 72.3 â€” 1.25 0.37 Pt/C-S 529.6, 531.6, 533.6 182.1 882.2 72.8 168.9 1.25 0.31 579 903 (a)Pt/A Pt/B Pt/C Pt/A-S Pt/B-S Pt/C-S 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 (b) T C D s i n g a l Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S T C D s i n g a l Temperature (K) Pt/Al 2 O 3 693 624 357 917 906 Fig. 5.

This suggested that the reducible sulfur species bonding with the support was not the key factor deactivating the catalyst. Considering that the re- duction regeneration significantly increased the light-off tem- perature of CO and C 3 H 6 oxidation over the Pt/Al 2 O 3 -S sam- ple, which did not have reducible sulfur species, one can con- clude that the poisoning of the Pt surface was mainly respon- sible for the deactivation of the sulfated Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts. Moreover, since the sulfur poisoning caused a tex- tural change of the Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts, a small part of the Pt particles was possibly buried into the bulk of the CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 support. This may be one factor causing the deactivation. 3 Conclusions The synthesis procedure affected Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 catalysts with the same composition and gave significant dif- ferences in structure, texture, sulfurization-desulfization be- havior, and catalytic behavior. The Pt/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 cata- lyst with the larger surface Ce/Zr ratio had more sulfur poi- soning, and consequently a higher light-off temperature for the catalytic removal of pollutants in simulated diesel exhaust gas. The deactivation was mainly due to the poisoning of Pt sur- face by sulfur. The CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 oxide with a Zr-rich surface gave a good dispersion of Pt, and hence excellent catalytic activity and sulfur tolerance.

Tel/Fax: +86-591-83770818 Three Pt/CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3 diesel oxidation catalysts were prepared by two different routes and characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The synthesis procedure affected the structure, texture, sulfur resistance, and catalytic activity of the catalysts. Sulfur poisoning increased the light-off temperature of all the catalysts, but the Pt/CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3 catalyst prepared by depositing ZrO2 and La2O3 on the surface of CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited better sulfur tolerance and catalytic activity with simulated diesel emission due to the high dispersion of Pt on CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3 oxide with a Zr-rich surface. 摘要 ：采用两种方法制备了三种 Pt/CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3 柴油车尾气氧化催化剂, 并用 X 射线衍射、N2 物理吸附、程序升温还原、程序升温脱附、X 射线荧光光谱和红外光谱等方法对其进行了表征. 结果发现, 制备方法对催化剂的结构、织构、抗硫性能及催化性能的影响非常大. 对其进行硫中毒, 导致起燃温度明显升高. 将 ZrO2 和 La2O3 沉积在 CeO2 表面所制得的 Pt/CeO2-ZrO2-La2O3 催化剂表现出更高的抗硫及催化氧化性能, 这主要归功于 Pt 在富 Zr 载体表面具有更高的分散性.
