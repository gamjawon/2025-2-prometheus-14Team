Graphical abstract Hierarchical hollow-structured ZnIn2S4/C heterostructure is designed through in-situ confined growth of ZnIn2S4/C nanosheets within porous hollow carbon spheres, demonstrating exceptional wide-temperature performance (–50 to 90 °C) in sodium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion batteries with ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) anodes promise a high capacity and abundant resources. However, their inherent low conductivity, large volume expansion and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit the development of the wide-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hierarchical hollow structural ZIS/C heterostructure through in situ confined growth of ZIS nanosheets in porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) via a hydrothermal method. This unique structure exhibits abundant heterostructures to facilitate charge transport, rich porous structures to promote electrolyte wettability, efficient space utilization to relieve volume expansion, as well as interconnected carbon networks to ensure framework stability. Consequently, ZIS/C exhibits exceptional cycling stability with 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Notably, ZIS/C demonstrates good wide-temperature performance operating at –50 ∼90 °C, especially, at –30 °C with a capacity of 208 mA h g−1 at 0.3A g−1. The full cell of ZIS/C||Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits excellent high-rate capability (178 mA h g−1 at 6A g−1). Keywords ZnIn2S4 nanosheets Confined growth Heterostructure interface Sodium-ion batteries Wide temperature application 1 Introduction Sodium-ion battery (SIB) have gained global attention as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, owing to their abundant availability and affordability [1,2]. However, one factor that is frequently overlooked is that stationary SIB in field operations need to adjust to the seasonal changes and regional differences in operating temperature fluctuations [3–5]. So far, a tremendous amount of research has shown that most materials demonstrate excellent high temperature (HT) performance due to the fast electronic and ionic conductivity of sodium ions, while performance at low temperature (LT) is greatly hindered by the sluggish Na+ ion migration due to the limited conductivity [6–8]. Wherein, the anode as a key configuration has an enormous influence on electrochemical performance. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) are generally regarded as promising anode materials due to their imperative features, such as high capacity, environmentally-friendliness and safety [9–12]. Nevertheless, low inherent electronic conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics hinder the development of TMDs anode materials, particularly at LT. Hierarchical hollow structure designed by embedding TMDs nanosheets into carbon matrix is one of the effective strategies to improve ion/electron conductivity and boost Na+ transport kinetics [13–16]. The unique structure can create heterostructures that provide more active sites for the adsorption of sodium ion and facilitate the transport of ions/electrons [17–20]. Meanwhile, porous hollow nanostructured carbon matrix with permeability can not only restrain the aggregation of nanosheets, but also exhibit improved wettability, thus providing more active sites for redox reaction and shortening the diffusion path of Na+, which improves Na+ diffusion kinetics [21,22]. In addition, the highly conductive three-dimensional carbon network structure fosters fast electron transfer between TMDs nanosheets and disperses the structural stress during charging and discharging. Nevertheless, the existing synthesis methods for hierarchical hollow structural TMDs/C are tedious and complex, especially for bimetallic sulfides. ZnIn2S4 (ZIS), as a representative of bimetallic sulfide, possesses a layered structure with wide interlayer spacing and resource abundance, making it a suitable anode material for energy storage [23–25]. ZIS, through multi-electron conversion reactions, exhibits higher theoretical capacities compared to intercalation-type anodes and carbon materials (e.g., hard carbon). Therefore, it’s promising to explore ZIS as an anode for wide-temperature SIBs, which has not yet been reported. Herein, we reported a simple synthesis of a hierarchical hollow structural ZIS/C heterostructure through the in situ confined growth of ZIS nanosheets within porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) via a hydrothermal method, and demonstrate its exceptional wide-temperature performance (–50 to 90 °C) in SIBs for the first time. Several desirable design features-including hierarchical hollow structures, few-layered nanosheets, and porous hollow carbon spheres, were effectively integrated. Such unique architectures not only provide abundant heterostructures to facilitate charge transport but also utilize space efficiently to accommodate volume expansion of ZIS. Additionally, they exhibit rich porosity to enhance electrolyte wettability and reaction kinetics, while establishing a well-defined electronic conductive network to accelerate electron transfer and framework stability. As expected, the as-prepared ZIS/C displays the high intrinsic electron conductivity and fast Na+ transport capability, which highly promotes the wide-temperature performance (–50 to 90 °C) and high-rate capability even at –30 °C. 2 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the synthetic process of the hierarchical hollow structural ZIS/C heterostructure composite by in situ confined growth of ZIS nanosheets in the PHCSs skeleton via hydrothermal method. The PHCSs skeleton, prepared from the self-assembly by silicate source and carbon resin, is produced by heat treatment and etching SiO2, which exhibits the corresponding intermediate products in Fig. S1(Supporting Information). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of carbon sphere present the diameter about 250 nm (Fig. 2 b, Fig. S2), which displays the hollow structure and numerous micropores (Fig. S3). After hydrothermal reaction, the ZIS/C heterostructure composite retains the backbone morphology of the original carbon skeleton and few-layered ZIS nanosheets are grown on the inside/outside of the framework (Fig. 1c, Fig. S4), which is consist with the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1(d). Thanks to the structural robustness of carbon skeleton, the electrochemical performance of ZIS/C can be enhanced significantly. When preparing ZIS nanosheets without the introduction of carbon skeleton, Fig. S5 presents the morphology of the ZIS nanosheets. Fig. 1(e) depicts lattice fringes with spacing of 0.19 nm and 0.32 nm corresponding to the (110) and (102) planes of ZIS, respectively. Significantly, a clear phase boundary is discernible, which suggests the successful formation of a ZIS/C heterojunction at the interface [26,27]. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1f) displays four diffraction rings marked with yellow color which respectively belong to the (006), (102), (110), (116) planes of hexagonal crystal phase, aligning with the findings in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum (Fig. 1g), where all the characteristic peaks correspond to ZIS (JCPDS No. 65–2023) [28,29]. The uniform distributions of C, Zn, In, and S elements in the ZIS/C can be confirmed by element mapping (Fig. 1i–l). The chemical compositions of ZIS/C were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).Fig. S6(a) shows the presence of carbon in composite confirmed by Raman spectra, where D and G bands are observed at 1390.1 and 1571.8 cm−1, respectively [30]. Additionally, two new characteristic peaks of ZIS/C at around 234.8 and 345.3 cm−1 attributed to the typical stretching modes of ZIS can also be observed. The survey spectra (S7) also display the presence of C, Zn, In, and S elements in ZIS/C. As displayed in Fig. S7(a), the high-resolution C 1 s spectra show three chemical environments of carbon, which can be assigned to the sp2 C=C bond, sp3 C–S bond, and C=O bond. The binding energy of sp3 C of ZIS/C (∼286.2 eV) is right-shifted ∼0.3 eV concerning that of the ZIS (∼286.5 eV). peaks at 1022.0 and 1045.1 eV correspond to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 , respectively (Fig. S7b). And peaks at 445.0 and 452.6 eV are assigned to In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 , respectively (Fig. S7c) [29]. The high-resolution S 2p spectra is resolved into two peaks for S 2p3/2 (161.7 eV) and S 2p1/2 (163.1 eV) (Fig. S7d). Compared with ZIS, the left-shifted binding energy of Zn 2p, In 3d and S 2p and the right-shited binding energy of C 1 s indicate the coupling interaction between ZnIn2S4 and PHCSs. In addition, the suitable specific surface area and porosity of ZIS/C is beneficial for improving electrolyte contact and facilitating electrolyte penetration (Fig. S8). The insertion/extraction performance of sodium ions in the carbon sphere, ZIS, and ZIS/C electrodes were comprehensively evaluated via assembling Na||PHCSs, Na||ZIS, and Na||ZIS/C half cells at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the carbon sphere, ZIS, and ZIS/C electrodes for the initial three cycles at 0.1 mV s−1 are showed in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S9. During the first reduction process, the peaks at 0.70 V and 0.44 V in the initial cathodic scan can be attributed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and the occurrence of conversion reactions. The reduction peaks at 0.32, 0.45 and 0.99 V correspond to the intercalation and conversion reactions of ZIS. The corresponding oxidation peaks located at 0.50, 0.64, and 0.99 V can be ascribed to stepwise desodiation process, which will be further verified by in-situ XRD characterizations. Moreover, a pair of reduction/oxidation peaks appear at 0.04 and 0.07 V due to the Na+ insertion/extraction processes in the carbon matrix, respectively, consistent with the results of the PHCSs sample (Fig. S9b). Note that the CV curves nearly overlap during the subsequent cycles, indicating the excellent structural stability and rapid conversion kinetics. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles show that ZIS/C exhibits initial discharge/charge reversible capacities of 717/578 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, affording an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 80.6% (Fig. 2b). By contrast, the ZIS nanosheets and PHCSs only exhibit ICE of 67.9% and 52.4% in half cells, respectively (Fig. S10). Among the prepared electrodes, with electric currents ranging from 0.05 to 8 A g−1 (Fig. 2c), ZIS/C electrode shows the highest specific capacities of 618, 580, 554, 516, 480, 432, 383 and 356 mA h g−1, respectively, indicating that the heterostructure accelerates Na+ reaction kinetics. When the original current density is recovered to 0.05 A g−1, the capacity slightly decreases and stabilizes at 552 mA h g−1 due to the partial irreversibility of the structural evolution. The ZIS/C electrode shows a much higher specific capacity of 501 mA h g−1 than that of ZIS nanosheets (145 mA h g−1) and PHCSs (141 mA h g−1) electrodes after 200 cycles at 0.2A g−1(Fig. 2d). When the current density reaches 5.0 A g−1, ZIS/C delivers a higher reversible capacity of 393 mA h g−1 with a high capacity retention of 92% after 1000 cycles (Fig. 2e). The capacity fading in the initial 80 cycles is related to the disintegration of the active material layers and slight exfoliated of the active material from the outside carbon shells during intercalation or deintercalation [31–33]. Then, the ZIS/C electrode shows a gradual increase in capacity for the 500th cycle, which is a result of activation process due to the formation of well-connected electron/ion mixed-conducting network [34–36]. Last, the capacity keeps stable till the 1000th cycle and the morphology of ZIS/C remains preserve (Fig. S11). These suggest that the carbon spheres serve as an effective shielding matrix to prevent the aggregation/exfoliation of the electroactive particles. Compared to the relevant papers, the ZIS/C in this work displays more competitive electrochemical performance (Fig. 2f) [24,37–45]. All of these suggest that in situ generation of ZIS nanosheets in the carbon skeleton can reduce the self-agglomeration of ZIS nanosheets, provide buffer space and enhance electrical conductivity, therefore maintaining good structural stability [46,47]. Inspired by the excellent Na+ storage performance of ZIS/C, a full battery system was assembled with the pre-sodiation ZIS/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode with a capacity ratio of 1:1.2, as illustrated in Fig. 2(g) The ZIS/C||NVP full battery delivers a reversible capacity of 214 mA h g−1 (based on anode) with a CE of 99.4% after 100 cycles at 0.3 A g−1 (Fig. 2h). Fig. 2(i) shows the rate capability of the ZIS/C||NVP full battery at various current densities. The energy density and power density of the full cell are calculated based on the total mass of the cathode and anode (Fig. S13). Correspondingly, the ZIS/C||NVP full cell exhibits a high energy density of 222 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 40 W kg−1 and retains an energy density of 138 Wh kg−1 even at a high-power density of 1769 W kg−1. These results underscore the substantial potential of ZIS/C in practical applications as SIB anode. To satisfy the needs over a wide temperature range [48–50], the charge/discharge measurement of the ZIS/C in the SIBs system are performed to investigate wide-temperature performance of the Na||ZIS/C half-cells (Fig. 3 ) and ZIS/C||NVP full-cells (Fig. S14). Fig. 3a exhibits discharge capacities of 555, 554, 556, 560, 570, 556 and 532mA h g−1 with different temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 90 °C. Note that the CE is nearly 100% within the temperature range of 30–60 °C, further demonstrating the improvement in reaction kinetics achieved through the construction of heterogeneous structure. Moreover, at 50 °C, the ZIS/C electrode exhibits excellent performance at high rates (Fig. 3b). Nevertheless, the CE drops significantly at 70 °C may be ascribable to the decomposition of ether-based electrolytes at high temperature [51,52]. Regarding low-temperature tests, Fig. 3(c) shows the specific capacity of the ZIS/C electrode at –20 °C, –30 °C, –40 °C, and –50 °C, which are 454, 440, 422, and 410 mA h g−1, respectively. Under –30 °C, capacity remains exceeding 230 mA h g−1 at 0.3A g−1, demonstrating the addition of conductive carbon to form of heterogeneous structures, enabling rapid electron transfer. Similarly, the ZIS/C anode also demonstrates excellent performance over a wide temperature range in the ZIS/C||NVP full cell system (Fig. S14), indicating the practical usability of the material. The in-situ XRD experiment was performed to probe the structure evolution of ZIS/C electrode material upon the charge/discharge process. The peak at 38.5°, 43.6°, and 44.8° are attributed to the stainless steel (Fig. 4 a). The reaction mechanism of ZIS/C exhibits the characteristics of intercalation and conversion reactions. When discharging from open-circuit voltage to 0.9 V, the peaks at 27.7° and 47.3° shift to lower angles, indicating the large lattice spacing expansion of (102) and (110) lattice planes [23,45]. An insertion reaction happens in this region and the Na x -ZIS solid solution is formed. As the discharge continues to 0.01 V, the diffraction peaks of ZIS gradually disappear, while those of In6S7 and Na2S emerge at 23.1° and 34.7°/36.0°, indicating that this process belongs to the conversion reaction [24,40]. Furthermore, combined with results of the ex-situ XPS, the peak positions of Zn element move towards the lower binding energies, indicating the reduction of Zn2+ (Fig. 4b). Similar trends are also observed in the In 3d spectra (Fig. 4c). Nevertheless, no characteristic diffraction peaks for Zn are observed in XRD spectra, suggesting that it’s amorphous phase with poor crystallinity. As charging proceeded, the peaks of Na2S disappear gradually, corresponding to the reappearance of ZIS with low intensity, indicating their poor crystallinity or the partial irreversibility of structural evolution. In order to explore the reaction kinetics of ZIS/C and ZIS nanosheets as anode materials for SIBs, CV curves at different sweep rates are shown in Fig. 4(d), Fig. S15 and Fig. S16. The CV curves retain well-defined reversible redox peaks at higher scan rates, indicating low polarization and a good rate capability (Fig. 5 d). The b-value was determined by fitting the log(i) versus log(v) plot. The high b values of ZIS/C electrode (0.99, 1.07, 0.98, 0.90, 1.06, and 0.80 for peak O1, O2, O3, R1, R2, and R3, respectively) suggest predominant pseudocapacitive behavior, which contributes to excellent rate performance (Fig. S15a) [53,54]. As shown in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. S15(b), the results demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive contribution increases with increasing scan rate, reaching 84% at 1.0 mV s−1. Besides, the diffusion coefficients of Na+ ions in ZIS and ZIS/C are calculated by using data obtained from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) [55,56]. Fig. 4f and Fig. 4g show that the D Na+ values of the ZIS/C electrode are higher than those of ZIS nanosheets, indicating the heterostructure engineering is beneficial for enhancing the Na+ diffusion kinetics [57,58]. We employed the first principles density functional theory (DFT) to understand the hetero‐interfacial electrochemical behavior which contributes to enhanced Na storage performance (Fig. 5 and S17). Fig. 5(c) displays that the adsorption energies of ZIS/C (–1.81 eV) are lower than those of ZIS (–1.55 eV) and carbon (–0.16 eV). The results suggest that the Na adsorbed by the ZIS/C heterostructures is the most stable model, implying that the heterointerface significantly boosts the Na adsorption ability [59,60]. Moreover, we investigated Na migration on ZIS and ZIS/C heterostructures (Fig. 5a and 5b). The Na diffusion energy barriers along the ZIS-I, ZIS-II, ZIS/C-I and ZIS/C-II are 0.55, 0.53, 0.27 and 0.29 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c). As expected, the ZIS/C-I diffusion barrier displays the lowest value, which markedly promotes facilitating Na+ transport at the interface [61,62]. Furthermore, the structural stability and integrity of 3D interconnected carbon networks, via the interfacial ZIS nanosheets connecting with porous carbon matrix, construct efficient electron/ion transfer pathways, as well as improve wettability and reaction kinetics, thus displaying promising electrochemical performance (Fig. 5e). 3 Conclusions In summary, a facile strategy has been proposed by constructing hierarchical hollow structural ZIS/C heterostructure obtained by confined growth ZIS nanosheets in porous hollow carbon spheres via hydrothermal method, which exhibits excellent electrochemical performance over a wide-temperature range (from –50 to 90 °C) in SIBs for the first time. The constructed structure with abundant heterostructures, rich porous structures, efficient space utilization, as well as interconnected carbon networks can be beneficial to the electrochemical performance in half/full cells of SIBs. Therefore, the ZIS/C can reach an excellent capacity of 393 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, and an outstanding wide-temperature performance (from –50 to 90 °C) with a high discharge capacity of 208 mA h g−1 at –30 °C under 0.3A g−1. Furthermore, the DFT calculations combined with the in-situ and ex-situ characterizations elucidate the reaction mechanism and rationalize the excellent electrochemical properties of ZIS/C.

        "dc:description": "Sodium-ion batteries with ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) anodes promise a high capacity and abundant resources. However, their inherent low conductivity, large volume expansion and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit the development of the wide-temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hierarchical hollow structural ZIS/C heterostructure through in situ confined growth of ZIS nanosheets in porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) via a hydrothermal method. This unique structure exhibits abundant heterostructures to facilitate charge transport, rich porous structures to promote electrolyte wettability, efficient space utilization to relieve volume expansion, as well as interconnected carbon networks to ensure framework stability. Consequently, ZIS/C exhibits exceptional cycling stability with 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Notably, ZIS/C demonstrates good wide-temperature performance operating at –50 ∼90 °C, especially, at –30 °C with a capacity of 208 mA h g−1 at 0.3A g−1. The full cell of ZIS/C||Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits excellent high-rate capability (178 mA h g−1 at 6A g−1).",
