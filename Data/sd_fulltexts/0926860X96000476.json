The technology has been without precedent. Its features are as follows: among all the iron catalysts for ammonia synthesis including Fe-Co catalyst, the catalyst has the highest activity, the easiest reduction and stronger mechanical strength. The cost is much lower than that of the catalyst containing cobalt. The industrial use of the catalyst indicated that it has remarkable effect of saving energy. The performance figures have reached the world leading level and the catalyst has been widely used in industry in China. Keywords: Fet _ ~O (wustite); Ammonia synthesis; Catalyst 1. Introduction There is an urgent need in the ammonia synthesis industry for a higher activity catalyst under low temperature and low pressure conditions. The conventional fused iron catalyst is made by melting magnetite, as main compo- nent, and additives such as A1203, K20, CaO, CoO and etc., as promoters. The ratio of Fe2+ and Fe3+ is between 0.4 and 0.8. Although research and improvement on the conventional fused iron catalyst has been in progress for more than 80 years, there has been no essential progress in improving the catalyst based on magnetite (Fe304). The ammonia synthesis catalyst in industry is still the iron catalyst based on magnetite. It was commonly believed that the catalyst has the best activity when its chemical composition * Corresponding author. Fax (+ 86-571) 5237605. 0926-860X/96/$15.00 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Promoters, Al203, K20; temperature, 450; space velocity, 10000 h i; pressure, 100 atm. and crystal structure of the precursor are most similar to those of magnetite. The relationship between the activity and the ratio (Fe2+/Fe3+) is as volcano type curve shown in Fig. 1 [1]. That seems to be an unquestioned classical conclu- sion. For several decades researchers developing new catalysts, while rigidly adhering to the conclusion, never changed the precursor composition (Fe304), but only the promoter components and their amounts. Thus almost all elements in the periodic table which might be used as promoter have been investigated widely. However, the activity of the catalyst was only improved little [1-9]. During 1970's and 1980's, Strel'tsov, Artyukh and their co-workers studied the effect of the Fe(II) content in precursor on the performances of catalyst. They found that \"the activity of the catalyst with 3.5%wt A1203 as the only promoter increased with increasing FeO content from 52.8% to 73.4%, and the catalysts showed a slight decrease in their activity from 41.8 to 52.8% FeO\" [10-12]. However, no further research was reported. In 1986, Huazhang et al. used wustite as the precursor of the iron catalyst, and found that the catalyst has extremely high ammonia synthetic activity and rapid reduction rate, which led to the invention of Fe1_ xO based catalyst for ammonia synthesis [13]. They systematically studied the relationship between the activity and the phase compositions in the precursor, and found a hump type curve between the activity and the ratio (FeZ+/Fe3+) as shown in Fig. 2. It was inferred from Fig. 2 that the monophase of iron oxide phase in the precursor is an essential condition for high activity of the catalyst and that a uniform 20 [ QIQ~,...,,,~ ] \"=1o] ......... 012345678910 Fe2+/Fe3+ Fig. 2.

Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 209-222 211 distribution of iron oxide phase and promoters is a key to making a better performance catalyst. The \"hump type\" curve was interpreted by the ratio of phase compositions in the precursor, that is, the activity change of the fused iron catalyst depends essentially on the molecule ratio of different iron oxides but not the atomic ratio of Fez+ and Fe3+, or FeZ+/Fe3+, in the precursor under certain promoters [14]. Thus we found that Fel_xO based catalyst with wustite phase structure (Fel_xO, 0.04 <x<0.10) for ammonia synthesis has the highest activity among all the fused iron catalysts for ammonia synthesis [15]. 2. Experimental 2.1. Samples A301 catalyst based on wustite was produced by melting a mixture of magnetite with a certain amount of reductive agent and promoters (A1203, K20, etc.). The molten material was poured into a cooling tank, solidified and cooled down to room temperature, followed by grinding the solid to the required particle size. The reference samples in our experiments are ICI74-1 [conventional catalyst 1 (Fe-Co), a commercial catalyst produced by ICI, England] provided by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, China, and All0-2 (conventional catalyst 2) produced and provided by Shangyu Chemical Plant, Zhejiang Province, China. The chemical compositions of A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 are listed in Table 1. The phases of the catalysts were distinguished by use of a Philips PW1732 X-ray diffractometer, and the crystal sizes were measured by Scherrer equation according to line broadening. 2.2. Evaluation of activity The tests on activity, thermostability and antitoxic performance of the three catalysts were carried out in a high-pressure reactor with a four-tubes fixed bed 14 mm in diameter, which permits simultaneous tests on four samples under same conditions. Table 1 The chemical compositions of the catalysts Catalyst FeO Fe203 Fe2 +/Fe 3 + Total Fe (%wt) (%wt) (%wt) A301 catalyst 74.4 ~ 84.6 10.4 ~ 20.6 4 ~ 9 72 ~ 73 Conventional catalyst 2 29.5 ~ 33.5 61.7 ~ 65.5 0.5 ~ 0.6 68 ~ 69 212 H.-Z. Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 209-222 The 3:1 hydrogen-nitrogen mixture was obtained by decomposition of am- monia, which had been subjected to an extensive purification procedure to eliminate catalyst poisons. After the catalysts had been reduced completely under a certain temperature programme [room temperature; 130/h 400 (2 h); 25/h 425 (6 h); 25/h 450 (12 h); 25/h 475 (8 h); 25/h 500 (4 h), 5.0 MPa and 3 104 h 1], the activity tests were carried out. After the activity test of the catalyst, the reaction temperature was raised to 500 and held that temperature for 20 h under 5.0 MPa and 3. 104 h-l. The effect of overheating on the catalysts were assessed by comparing the activities of the catalysts before and after overheating. To assess the effect of presence of carbon monoxide on the catalyst activity, a certain amount of carbon monoxide was injected into the testing system to reach 500 ppm in the synthetic gas. The catalysts were poisoned instantaneously. Then carbon monoxide injection was stopped, and the activities of the catalysts recovered slowly. The antitoxic performances of the catalysts were investigated from the change curves of exit ammonia concentration from the microreactor tubes as a function of time, before poisoning and after recovered, under normal conditions. 2.3. Evaluation of reduction The reductions of the catalysts were studied with a thermobalance. The range of thermogravity (TG) is 6 mg, the range of derivative thermogravity (DTG) is 2 mg/min. The temperature programme was as follows. The catalyst was heated at a constant rate of 10/min from room temperature to 200, held that temperature for 120 rain for desorption of physically adsorbed water in the catalyst, and then heated at a constant rate of 3/min from 200 to 650. The particle size of the catalysts is 0.034-0.044 mm, the mass of the catalyst is ca. 20 mg, the volume flow of H2 is 175 ml/min. The reduction processes were carried out in a stream of hydrogen. Reduction reactions of the conventional catalysts are as follows: Fe304 + 4H2 = 3Fe + 4H20 (1) FeO + H2 = Fe + H20 (2) Reduction reaction of A301 catalyst is as follows: Fel_xO -]- H2 = (1 -x)Fe + H20 (3) The relationship between the value of x in Fel _xO and the ratio of Fe:+/Fe3+ is as follows: x= 1/[3 + 2(FeZ+/Fe3+)] (4) In addition, the microreactor experiments can give information about relative ease of reduction of the catalysts. This was achieved by monitoring the increase H.-Z. Liu et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 209-222 2 l 3 in rate of production of ammonia, as a function of temperature and time, during the reduction phase of the experiment. The reduction was carried out using a programmed rise in temperature (shown in Fig. 14), and relative reducibilities can be determined by how quickly the exit ammonia concentration reaches a steady state. Fig. 14 gives typical \"reduction curves\" for the A301 catalyst and the conventional catalysts. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Phase analysis Iron and oxygen can form three iron oxides, FezO3, Fe304, and FeO. In crystallography, they are called as hematite, magnetite and wustite, respectively. Wustite is a non-stoichiometric compound, the chemical formula is normally expressed as Fe~ _xO, x is a value drifted stoichiometry, so called as defect lattice concentration. From a solid-chemistry viewpoint, Fel_xO is a solid solution of Fe203 and FeO, therefore x value may be measured by chemical analysis. It is well known that the precursor chemical composition of the conventional iron catalysts is Fe304, which was proved by the X-ray diffraction analysis of these specimen. When FeZ+/Fe3+> 0.5, there are also FeO peaks (main peak I/1o = 10, 20 = 49.28) in addition to Fe304 peaks in the XRD spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a). These are in agreement with the precedent's experimental results.

The results mentioned above are in agreement with the M~Sssbauer spectroscopies of these samples shown in Fig. 4. The M~3ssbauer spectroscopy of conventional catalyst 2 consists of two typical hexa-finger peaks of Fe304 [Fig. 4(b)], and that of A301 catalyst consists of one typical dissymmetrical double peak of Fel_xO [Fig. 4(a)]. The M~Sssbauer parameters are listed in Table 2. It is seen from the tabulated data that calcium ion (Ca2+) inserts into the lattice structure of wustite, in addition to which, alumina with FeO formed a Table 2 M~Sssbauer parameters of the A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 Catalyst Phase IS QS MF Content of Fe (mm/s) (mm/s) (kOe) (%) A301 catalyst FeI xO (containing Ca2+ ) 0.945 0.946 53.58 0.977 0.514 44.85 FeA1 ~ 04 0.895 1.57 Conventional Fet _ yO 1.036 1.020 5.68 catalyst 2 0.923 0.449 2.77 Fe304 A 0.390 0.111 487.43 26.82 Fe204 B 0.778 0.060 458.15 43.92 KFellOi7 0.745 0.240 442.19 9.48 H.-Z Liu et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 209-222 215 40 00 10000 13000 1 40.00 100.00 130.00 28 Fig. 5.

This is also why the lattice constant of A301 catalyst (see Table 3) is bigger than that of pure wustite listed reference data [16]. Therefore, A301 catalyst is a novel catalyst for ammonia synthesis which is completely different from the conventional catalyst in chemical composition and crystal structure of the precursor. Although the precursor phase compositions of A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 are not same, their active states are ~x-Fe; experimental results are shown in Fig. 5. The crystalline phases and some structure parameters of A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 are listed in Table 3.

The activity of A301 catalyst is much higher than those of the conventional catalysts as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The relative activity of A301 catalyst is 10-37% higher than those of the conventional catalysts at 325-425. The reaction rate of A301 is 1.3-1.9 times as fast as those of the conventional catalysts. This effect increases with decreasing temperature. In addition, it is seen from Fig. 6 that the temperature of A301 is 25-40 lower than those of the conventional catalysts under same pressure, same space velocity and same exit ammonia concentration. Figs. 8 and 9 give the relative activities of A301 catalyst and the conventional catalysts at different pressures and different space velocities. It can be seen that the activity of A301 catalyst is the highest among all the catalysts for all reaction conditions. \"r Z 5 0 C 0 0 c- O E E 3O 25 20' 15' 10., 0 4 space velocity x10-4, h-1 Fig. 9.

The experimental results of thermostabilities of the catalysts and the effects of presence of carbon monoxide on the activities of A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 are given in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. With respect to resistance to such overheating, A301 catalyst behaved in a similar fashion to the conven- tional catalysts. But with respect to resistance to carbon monoxide species, A301 catalyst has an advantage over conventional catalyst 2. It is seen from Fig. 11 that when carbon monoxide was introduced into reaction system, the drop rate of activity of A301 catalyst is slower than that of conventional catalyst 2, after carbon monoxide was eliminated from reaction system, the response in the activity of A301 catalyst is more rapid than that of conventional catalyst 2. In parallel with the measurement of catalyst performances, the mechanical properties of A301 catalyst and conventional catalyst 2 (i.e. resistance to attrition) were measured.

It is confirmed that the mechanical properties of A301 catalyst are at least as good as those of conventional catalyst 2. Fig. 12 gives \"TG-DTG curves\" for A301 catalyst and the conventional catalysts. It is seen from Fig. 12 that A301 catalyst reduces more easily than the conventional catalysts, the terminal reduction temperature of A301 catalyst is about 100 lower than that of conventional catalyst 2. Typical isothermal reduction curves of A301 catalyst and the conventional catalysts at 450 are shown in Fig. 13. It can be concluded that the average reduction rate of A301 catalyst is 3.3 times as fast as that of conventional catalyst 2 when the reduction degree is between 0 and 0.8. In addition, the microreactor experiments can also give information about the relative ease of reduction of the catalysts. Typical I 519.1 b 2 - 348.0 ~ 6~19.7b ! ! , , !

It can be seen that A301 catalyst reduces significantly more easily than all other catalysts tested and that ammonia production begins sooner and at a lower temperature than for the conventional catalysts. 4. Application in industry Since 1991 A301 catalyst has been used successfully in the ammonia synthesis industry [16]. Up to now 2000 tons of A301 catalyst have been used in hundreds of plants, producing 20 000-100 000 tons of ammonia per year in 17 provinces in China [17]. For example, in Shou Guang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, Shandong Province, China, the synthesis tower (1 m in diameter) is charged with 15 tons of A301 catalyst. The reduction of the charge took place at a lower temperature than H.-Z.

A substantial rate of reduction was obtained at 350 whereas well over 400 is required for conventional catalyst 2. The time of reduction is decreased to 102 h, compared to the 159 h required for conventional catalyst 2. The freshly reduced catalyst started producing ammonia at very low tempera- ture (after a plant upset an exotherm due to ammonia production was observed when the catalyst bed inlet temperature was only 260). During normal operation, catalyst bed temperature (axial-tube cooled converter, so-called \"thermal point\" temperature) was obtained at 450-460 compared with 465-475 required for conventional catalyst 2. Compared with using conven- tional catalyst 2 under same equipment and process conditions, the production of ammonia is increased from 150 tons to 180 tons per day (maximum 216 tons per day) and the operating pressure is decreased from 30 MPa to 28 MPa. Fig. 15 gives the change curve of the production of ammonia per month during twenty months on line. Thus, the experience at Shou Guang Chemical Fertilizer Plant has been 222 H.-Z. Liu et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 142 (1996) 209-222 wholly in accordance with the findings in the laboratory. Operating experience with A301 catalyst has shown it to possess high activity and easy reduction. It is worth noting that A301 catalyst is suitable specially for use under low pressure and low temperature conditions, although it has been used successfully under medium pressure and temperature conditions mentioned above and showed remarkable performances. If it is used under low pressure and low temperature conditions, it will allow ammonia to be produced more economically and efficiently, resulting in both energy savings and economic benefit.

Fax (+86-571) 5237605. A novel catalyst based on Fe1−x O (wustite) has been developed for ammonia synthesis. The technology has been without precedent. Its features are as follows: among all the iron catalysts for ammonia synthesis including FeCo catalyst, the catalyst has the highest activity, the easiest reduction and stronger mechanical strength. The cost is much lower than that of the catalyst containing cobalt. The industrial use of the catalyst indicated that it has remarkable effect of saving energy. The performance figures have reached the world leading level and the catalyst has been widely used in industry in China.
