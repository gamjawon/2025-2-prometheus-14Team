Graphical abstract In the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene into 1,3-butadiene, γ-Bi2MoO6 showed a better catalytic performance than α-Bi2Mo3O12 due to the facile oxygen mobility of γ-Bi2MoO6. Three types of bismuth molybdate catalysts, α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6, were prepared by a co-precipitation method for use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene. Unlike α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6, it was found that β-Bi2Mo2O9 was thermally unstable and decomposed into α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 at the reaction temperature of 420°C. Therefore, β-Bi2Mo2O9 could not serve as an efficient catalyst in the reaction. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene into 1,3-butadiene, γ-Bi2MoO6 showed a better catalytic performance than α-Bi2Mo3O12. The different catalytic performance between α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts was elucidated by temperature-programmed reoxidation (TPRO) experiments. It was revealed that the enhanced catalytic performance of γ-Bi2MoO6 was attributed to the facile oxygen mobility of γ-Bi2MoO6. Keywords Bismuth molybdate n-Butene 1,3-Butadiene Oxidative dehydrogenation Oxygen mobility Temperature-programmed reoxidation (TPRO) 1 Introduction 1,3-Butadiene has attracted much attention as a raw material for styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) in the petrochemical industries [1]. Steam cracking [2], direct dehydrogenation of n-butene [3–5], and oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene [6–9] are well known processes used for the production of 1,3-butadiene. Steam cracking, the major manufacturing process for 1,3-butadiene, involves many problems in both marketing and energy management, because steam cracking produces not only 1,3-butadiene but also many petrochemical raw materials such as ethylene, propylene, and isobutene, simultaneously [2]. Direct dehydrogenation of n-butene into 1,3-butadiene is thermodynamically unfavorable and requires high reaction temperature [2–4]. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene into 1,3-butadiene is thermodynamically favorable and requires low reaction temperature [6–9], compared to direct dehydrogenation of n-butene. Therefore, oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene has been recognized as a promising process that can produce 1,3-butadiene in a single unit [6–9]. Bismuth molybdates have been widely investigated as efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene [6–9]. Typically, three types of bismuth molybdate catalysts, α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6, have been considered for this reaction [7,10–12]. However, it is known that β-Bi2Mo2O9 is thermally unstable at temperatures ranging from 400 to 550°C [7,13]. Therefore, major studies on the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene have been focused on the α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts. It is also known that the catalytic performance of bismuth molybdate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene strongly depends on the oxygen mobility of the catalyst [7,14,15]. It is expected that a catalyst with high oxygen mobility may show an excellent catalytic performance in this reaction [6,14–18]. In this work, α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 were prepared by a co-precipitation method for use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene. The prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, Raman spectroscopy, and ICP-AES analyses. Thermal stability of the catalysts was also investigated. Oxygen mobility of the catalyst was measured by temperature-programmed reoxidation (TPRO) experiment to elucidate the catalytic performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of bismuth molybdate catalysts Bismuth molybdate catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method. Known amount of bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was dissolved in distilled water which was acidified with concentrated nitric acid. The solution was then added dropwise into the aqueous solution containing known amount of ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) under vigorous stirring. During the co-precipitation step, pH of the mixed solution was precisely controlled by adjusting the amount of ammonia solution added. The pH values were kept at 1.5, 5.0, and 3.0 in the preparation of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6, respectively [6,19]. After the resulting solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 1h, the precipitate was filtered to obtain a solid product. The solid product was dried overnight at 110°C, and then it was calcined at 475°C for 5h to yield the bismuth molybdate catalyst. 2.2 Characterization Formation of pure α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 was confirmed by XRD (MAC Science, M18XHF-SRA) and Raman spectroscopy (Horiaba Jobin Yvon, T64000) measurements. Bi/Mo atomic ratios of the prepared catalysts were determined by ICP-AES (Shimadz, ICP-1000IV) analyses. Surface areas of the catalysts were measured using an ASAP 2010 instrument (Micromeritics). In order to measure the oxygen mobility of the catalysts, temperature-programmed reoxidation (TPRO) experiments were carried out. For the TPRO experiment, each catalyst was partially reduced by carrying out the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene without oxygen feed at 420°C for 3h. After the reduced catalyst was placed in a conventional TPRO apparatus, a mixed stream of oxygen (10%) and helium (90%) was introduced to the catalyst sample. Furnace temperature was raised from room temperature to 500°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. The amount of oxygen consumed was detected using a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3 Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene into 1,3-butadiene was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor. Feed composition was fixed at n-butene:oxygen=1:0.75. C4 raffinate-3 containing 72.5wt% n-butene (1-butene(14.2wt%)+ trans-2-butene(38.3wt%)+ cis-2-butene(20.0wt%)) was used as a n-butene source, and air was used as an oxygen source (nitrogen in air served as a carrier gas). Prior to the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with air at 470°C for 1h. The catalytic reaction was carried out at 420°C. GHSV was fixed at 300h−1 on the basis of n-butene. Reaction products were periodically sampled and analyzed with a gas chromatography. Conversion of n-butene and selectivity for 1,3-butadiene were calculated on the basis of carbon balance as followings. Yield for 1,3-butadiene was calculated by multiplying conversion and selectivity. Conversion of n -butene = moles of n -butene reacted moles of n -butene supplied Selectivity for 1,3-butadiene = moles of 1,3-butadiene formed moles of n -butene reacted 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characteristics of prepared catalysts Formation of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts was well confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and ICP-AES measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of prepared bismuth molybdate catalysts. These XRD patterns and Raman spectra were well consistent with those reported in previous works [7,14,20–22], indicating successful formation of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts. Bi/Mo atomic ratios and BET surface areas of prepared catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . Bi/Mo atomic ratios of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 were measured to be 0.6, 0.98, and 1.96, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the theoretical values (Bi/Mo=2/3 for α-Bi2Mo3O12, Bi/Mo=1 for β-Bi2Mo2O9, and Bi/Mo=2 for γ-Bi2MoO6). This result also supports that bismuth molybdate catalysts were successfully prepared in this work. BET surface areas of bismuth molybdate catalysts were found to be very low (ca. 2.0–4.0m2/g), as reported in literatures [6,14,23]. 3.2 Thermal stability of catalysts Thermal stability of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts was examined by XRD measurements. For this purpose, all the catalysts were thermally treated at 420°C for 48h in an air stream. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts obtained before and after the thermal treatment. It was observed that α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts showed no difference in XRD patterns before and after the thermal treatment, indicating that α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts are thermally stable during the catalytic reaction performed at 420°C. However, β-Bi2Mo2O9 catalyst exhibited different XRD patterns before and after the thermal treatment. This means that β-Bi2Mo2O9 catalyst is thermally unstable at the reaction temperature of 420°C [7,13]. In order to ensure the thermal decomposition behavior of β-Bi2Mo2O9, β-Bi2Mo2O9 catalyst was treated at 420°C in an air stream with the variation of thermal treatment time. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of β-Bi2Mo2O9 obtained with the variation of thermal treatment time at 420°C. What is noticeable is that α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 phases appeared with increasing thermal treatment time. A close looking at the Raman spectra in Fig. 3 revealed that β-Bi2Mo2O9 started to decompose after a certain period of thermal treatment (after 12h). In order to quantify the degree of decomposition of β-Bi2Mo2O9, the strongest XRD and Raman peaks of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 phases in the thermally decomposed β-Bi2Mo2O9 were identified, and then their intensity ratios were calculated for the precise quantification according to the method in literature [24]. In the calculations, it was assumed that 2mol of β-Bi2Mo2O9 were decomposed into 1mol of α-Bi2Mo3O12 and 1mol of γ-Bi2MoO6 [24]. Table 2 summarizes the degree of decomposition of β-Bi2Mo2O9 with the variation of thermal treatment time at 420°C. Quantification for the degree of decomposition of β-Bi2Mo2O9 after 12 and 18h was not a simple task due to the weak peak intensities. Table 2 shows that ca. 55 and 70% of β-Bi2Mo2O9 were decomposed into α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 after 24 and 48h, respectively. This result implies that β-Bi2Mo2O9 cannot serve as an efficient catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene performed at 420°C. In this work, therefore, β-Bi2Mo2O9 was excluded in the catalytic performance tests. 3.3 Catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene Fig. 4 shows the catalytic performance of α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene at 420°C after 48h. Conversion of n-butene and selectivity for 1,3-butadiene obtained with γ-Bi2MoO6 catalyst were much higher than those obtained with α-Bi2Mo3O12 catalyst. As a consequence, γ-Bi2MoO6 catalyst exhibited a higher yield for 1,3-butadiene than α-Bi2Mo3O12 catalyst. In order to verify the different catalytic performance between α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts, TPRO experiments were carried out with an aim of measuring the oxygen mobility in both catalysts. At first, oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene was carried out in the absence of oxygen feed at 420°C for 3h in order for the catalyst to consume lattice oxygens for the reaction. Table 3 summarizes the catalytic performance of α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 in the presence or absence of oxygen feed at 420°C after 3h. As listed in Table 3, both α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts in the absence of oxygen feed exhibited comparable catalytic activities to those in the presence of oxygen feed. This means that both catalysts consumed lattice oxygens for the reaction in the absence of oxygen feed [6,14–18]. TPRO experiments were conducted with partially reduced catalysts obtained in the absence of oxygen feed. Fig. 5 shows the TPRO profiles of partially reduced α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts. The amount of oxygen consumption measured by TPRO experiment is equivalent to the amount of oxygen vacancy in the partially reduced catalyst. The peak representing make-up oxygen in the γ-Bi2MoO6 appeared at low temperature region (150–300°C), while that in the α-Bi2Mo3O12 appeared at high temperature region (300–450°C). Although, both α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts showed the maximum TPRO peaks below the reaction temperature of 420°C, one should compare the oxygen mobility on the basis of relative TPRO peak position because the TPRO profiles vary depending on the experimental conditions such as heating rate and feed flow rate. In the TPRO measurements, the lower TPRO peak temperature corresponds to the higher oxygen mobility. The above result strongly supports that γ-Bi2MoO6 catalyst retains higher oxygen mobility than α-Bi2Mo3O12 catalyst. Therefore, it is concluded that the enhanced catalytic performance of γ-Bi2MoO6 was attributed to the facile oxygen mobility of γ-Bi2MoO6. 4 Conclusions α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method for use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene. Formation of α-Bi2Mo3O12, β-Bi2Mo2O9, and γ-Bi2MoO6 catalysts was well confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and ICP-AES analyses. It was found that β-Bi2Mo2O9 was thermally unstable and decomposed into α-Bi2Mo3O12 and γ-Bi2MoO6 at the reaction temperature of 420°C, and therefore, β-Bi2Mo2O9 could not serve as an efficient catalyst in the reaction. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene, it was revealed that γ-Bi2MoO6 showed a better catalytic performance than α-Bi2Mo3O12 due to the facile oxygen mobility of γ-Bi2MoO6.
