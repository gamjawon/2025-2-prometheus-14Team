Ammonia (NH3) is an excellent candidate for hydrogen storage and transport. However, producing NH3 under mild conditions is a long-term, arduous task. Atomic cluster catalysts (ACCs) have been shown to be effective for catalytic N2-to-NH3 conversion, opening the door to the development of efficient catalysts under mild conditions. Still, ACC formation with thermally stable catalytic sites remains a challenge because of their high surface free energy. Herein, we report anchoring Ba and/or Ce onto Ru ACCs (2 wt% Ru atomic clusters supported on N-doped carbon) to form so-called clusters–metal oxide promoters electronic interaction (CMEI) to stabilize the Ru atomic clusters. The resulting Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs significantly boost the NH3 synthesis rate to 56.2 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1 at 400 °C and 1 MPa, which is 7.5-fold higher than that of Ru ACC. The strengthened CMEI between the Ba/Ce and Ru atomic clusters across the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC enables electron transfer from Ba and/or Ce to Ru atomic clusters. As such, the electron-enriched Ru atom could facilitate electron transfer to N≡N bond π* orbitals, which would weaken the N≡N bond and drive the eventual conversion of N2 to NH3. This study offers insight into the role of CMEI in Ru ACCs and provides an effective approach for designing stable atomic cluster catalysts for NH3 synthesis. Graphical Abstract Doping Ba and/or Ce on Ru atomic clusters catalyst enhances the electronic interaction between Ru and Ba and/or Ce through the formation of cluster-metal oxide interfaces. This interaction promotes the donation of electrons to Ru, thereby favoring N2-to-NH3. Keywords Atomic cluster Promoter N2 activation Ammonia synthesis Electronic interaction 1 Introduction In response to energy and environmental challenges, intensive research has focused on developing efficient, renewable, and “carbon-free” energy sources. Hydrogen energy systems show great promise but face storage-related challenges [1–3]. Among candidates for hydrogen storage, ammonia (NH3) stands out because of its high energy density (12.8 GJ m−3), significant hydrogen content (17.6 wt%), and ease of liquefaction [4]. In addition, large-scale transport of liquid NH3 is well established [5,6]. However, current industrial NH3 production relies predominantly on the well-known Haber-Bosch (H-B) process. This technology utilizes iron (Fe) catalysts and fossil fuel-sourced hydrogen (H2), requiring harsh operating conditions (490–510 °C and 15–20 MPa) and significant carbon dioxide emissions (1.5–1.9 tCO2-eq tNH3 −1) [7–9]. Recently, interest in integrating renewable energy sources with the H-B process has grown. This has led to the development of a new electrolysis-driven HB (eHB) process, which relies on renewable electricity to produce H2 through water electrolysis [9,10]. Generally, the output pressure of H2 production from the water electrolysis system is relatively low (< 5 MPa, mainly in the range 1.6–3.2 MPa) [7]. A major challenge in the eHB process is the development of advanced NH3 synthesis catalysts that can flexibly match the pressures of H2 from water electrolysis and the NH3 synthesis system. Supported ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have shown promising high performance in NH3 production under milder conditions (≤ 400 °C, < 10 MPa) than Fe catalysts [7,11]. Consequently, significant efforts have been dedicated to optimizing Ru-based catalysts for NH3 synthesis [12,13]. Recently, a novel class of atomic scale catalysts for NH3 synthesis has gained significant attention [14,15]. Compared to conventional Ru nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, subnanometric, atomic-sized Ru-based catalysts not only exhibit superior activity but also provide a different N2 activation pathway [16,17]. Specifically, the unique geometric and electronic structures of Ru atomic cluster catalysts (Ru ACCs) promote strong interactions of Ru d orbitals with the s and p orbitals of N2 molecules through intra-cluster interaction. This interaction facilitates the conversion of N2 to NH3 via an associative pathway [17]. Although Ru ACC application in catalytic NH3 synthesis is attractive, their atomic-scale size results in a high Ru atom surface free energy, rendering these atomic cluster catalysts susceptible after long operation to thermal sintering via surface migration [18,19]. To address this, we can draw insights from single-atom stabilization strategies. These strategies adjust the chemical potential through interfacial interactions, such as strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) and electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) respectively [20,21]. Similar to single atoms, Ru ACCs with dispersed atomic clusters have the potential to prevent sintering by tailoring the interactions. In this context, Ru atomic clusters act as the “host material,” while the added promoters function as the “guest groups.” With this in mind, we demonstrate a strong electronic interaction between atomic clusters and guest metals, called the clusters-metal oxide promoters electronic interaction (CMEI). CMEI inclusion provides a promising medium for effectively manipulating the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Ru atomic clusters. Accordingly, understanding and adjusting the electronic structures of Ru atomic clusters at the atomic level is vital for the development of stable, highly active Ru ACCs for NH3 synthesis under mild conditions. Barium (Ba) was chosen as a “guest group” in this work because it is notably efficacious in promoting N2 activation for Ru nanoparticle (NP) catalysts [11,22]. CeO2, with its unique 4f electron configuration, possesses a reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair and abundant oxygen vacancies [23], which could enhance the absorption and activation of N2 and H2 and thus improve Ru NP catalytic performance [24]. Consequently, Ba and Ce are promising “guests” in “host” Ru ACCs for NH3 synthesis. In this study, Ba and/or Ce were anchored onto Ru ACC to stabilize Ru atomic clusters. The strong CMEI formation enables Ba/Ce/Ru ACC to exhibit superior activity and high catalytic stability. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) coupled with quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (quasi-in situ XPS) analyses demonstrated that the CMEI formation between Ru and Ba/Ce not only stabilizes Ru atomic clusters but also enhances electron donation to them, thus promoting N2 activation to form NH3. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials Ru3(CO)12 and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (AR grade) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Melamine, MgO, Ba(NO3)2, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, H2SO4, and HNO3 (AR grade) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. High-purity argon (99.999%), hydrogen (99.999%), and nitrogen (99.999%) gases, as well as H2/N2 and H2/Ar mixtures in designated proportions, were provided by Linde Industrial Gases. D2 (99.999% purity) was supplied by Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. 2.2 Catalyst preparation Ru ACC (2 wt% Ru with N-doped carbon as support) was prepared following a procedure similar to our previously reported method [17] except for the change of Ru content to 2 wt%. Ba/Ru ACC was prepared by impregnation. Briefly, Ba(NO3)2 was dissolved in deionized water (3 mL) and impregnated with Ru ACC. The theoretical weight ratio of Ba to catalyst was 5 wt%. Synthetic procedures for Ce/Ru ACC and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC were similar to that of Ba/Ru ACC except for the use and extra addition, respectively, of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. All samples were calcined at 400 °C in 10% H2/Ar for 2 h. Additionally, 5 wt% Cs/Ru/MgO was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation for comparison. Stoichiometric amounts of ruthenium (III) nitrosyl nitrate and cesium nitrate were dissolved in deionized water and added dropwise to MgO. The products were then dried at 80 °C for 12 h and calcined at 400 °C in 10% H2/Ar for 2 h. Scheme 1 Schematic illustration of clusters-metal oxide promoters electronic interaction over the Ru atomic clusters catalysts. 2.3 Catalyst characterizations Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was examined using a Panalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation and operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw spectrometer with a 532 nm laser for excitation. N2 physisorption isotherms were measured at –196 °C on the ASAP 2020 apparatus. The specific surface areas were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The catalyst quantitative elemental content was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed at the JEM-2010 microscope facility to examine the catalyst morphologies. Atomic-resolution AC-STEM images were captured using a JEOL JEM-ARM 200F instrument with a CEOS probe corrector and a guaranteed resolution of 0.08 nm. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) were collected at room temperature using a Bruker A300 spectrometer with a 9.85 GHz magnetic field strength. XPS analysis was obtained on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi instrument with monochromatic X-rays generated by the Al-Kα source (1,486.6 eV). The binding-energy correction was calibrated by a C–C bond peak at 284.8 eV. Ru K-edge XAFS measurements were recorded in transmission mode using beamline 1W2B at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The acquired XAS data were fitted and normalized using IFEFFIT software [25]. The k 3-weighted EXAFS spectra were obtained by subtracting the post-edge background from the overall absorption and normalizing it to the edge jump step. Subsequently, the k 3-weighted χ(k) data of Ru K-edge were Fourier transformed to real (R) space using a Hanning window (dk = 1.0 Å−1) to separate the EXAFS contributions from different coordination shells. To obtain the quantitative structural parameters around the central atoms, least-squares curve parameter fitting was performed using the ARTEMIS module of the IFEFFIT software package. The k 3 weighting, k-range of 2.5–10.0 Å−1, and R range of 1.0–3.0 Å were used for the fitting. The four parameters of coordination number, bond length, and Debye-Waller factor (C.N., R, σ2) were fitted without any of them being fixed, constrained, or correlated. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CO pulse chemisorption experiments were conducted using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. For H2-TPR, the sample (50 mg) was placed in a U-shaped quartz tube, treated in Ar (30 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 2 h, and then cooled to 50 °C. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 450 °C in a 10% H2/Ar flow (30 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) signals were collected during this process. For the CO pulse experiment, 50 mg of the sample was first reduced in 10% H2/Ar at 400 °C for 2 h and then purged under an Ar flow for 1 h. After cooling down to 50 °C, CO pulses (5% CO/He) were injected into the sample. The Ru dispersion was determined from the CO pulse chemisorption capacity, and it was assumed that one CO molecule was absorbed by one Ru atom. Quasi-in situ XPS measurements were also performed using a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi instrument. The corresponding samples were quasi-in situ heated to 400 °C under 10% H2/Ar (40 mL min−1) or 25% N2-75% H2 (40 mL min−1), respectively. Finally, the spectra were recorded at room temperature. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using a 25% N2-75% D2 mixture was conducted on Nicolet Nexus FT-IR spectrometer in the range 1000–4000 cm−1. Typically, the sample was pre-treated in a 10% H2/Ar (40 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 2 h and then flushed in Ar for 1 h. The background spectrum was subtracted in Ar, and the spectra were obtained after exposure to a 25% N2-75% D2 mixture at different temperatures. In situ DRIFTS using N2 as a probe molecule was similar to DRIFTS of 25% N2-75% D2 adsorption, except for recording spectra at N2 adsorption and 50 °C. 2.4 Catalytic performance 2.4.1 NH3 synthesis activity test The NH3 synthesis performance was investigated in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor with a stainless steel tube. Prior to the test, the catalysts were reduced at 400 °C with a flow of 25% N2-75% H2 for 4 h. Subsequently, the catalysts were evaluated at a given temperature and pressure with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 60000 mL g−1 h−1. The outlet NH3 concentration was measured in a known H2SO4 aqueous solution (0.05 mol L−1) and further determined by ion chromatography (Thermo Scientific, DIONEX, ICS-600). The turnover frequency based on the surface Ru active sites (TOFRu, s−1) was calculated as follows: (1) TOFRu = r/n Ru D M where nR u represents Ru molar amount, and D M represents the dispersion of Ru active sites, which can be obtained from XPS results with the Fernández method [26]. 2.4.2 Reaction orders measurement All reactions were performed at 400 °C and 1 MPa. For N2 and H2 reaction orders, the total flow rate was maintained with Ar as the balance gas (WHSV = 60000 mL g−1 h−1). For the NH3 reaction order, the ratio of N2 to H2 was fixed at 1:3, but the flow rate varied. The reaction order was calculated according to the previously reported methods [27]: (2) r = kP N 2 α P H 2 β P N H 3 γ where k represents the rate constant; P N2, P H2, and P NH3 are the partial pressures of N2, H2, and NH3, respectively; and α, β, and γ are the reaction orders for N2, H2, and NH3, respectively. If P N2 and P H2 are fixed, Eq. (2) can be expressed as (3) r = k ′ P N H 3 γ where k′ is (4) k ′ = kP N 2 α P H 2 β The logarithm of Eq. (3) is expressed as (5) log(r) = log(k′) +γlog(PNH 3) The relationships among the total flow (F), system pressure (P total), and outlet NH3 concentration (C NH3) can be illustrated as follows: (6) r = P NH3F/RT (7) P NH3 = C NH3 P total where R and T denote the gas constant and temperature, respectively. In practical measurements, F, P total, and C NH3 are experimental quantities. Inserting Eqs. (6) and (7) into Eq. (5): (8) log ( P N H 3 ) = log ( k ′ ) + log ( R T ) 1 - γ + 1 1 - γ log ( 1 F ) where (log(k') + log(RT))/(1–γ) is constant. Therefore, NH3 reaction order (γ) would be obtained by the slope of 1/(1–γ) for log(P NH3) plotted versus log(1/F). For the N2 and H2 reaction orders, the logarithm of Eq. (2) is expressed as: (9) log(r) – γlog(P NH3) = log(k) + αlog(P N2) +βlog(P H2) Assuming the partial pressure of H2 is unchanged, βlog(P H2) can be regarded as a constant. Plotting (log(r) – γlog(P NH3)) versus log(P N2) yields a slope α that is the N2 reaction order. Inversely, when the partial pressure of H2 is unchanged, plotting (log(r) γlog(P NH3)) versus log(P H2) yields a slope β that is the H2 reaction order. 3 Results and discussion According to the ICP-AES results, the Ru levels in the Ru ACC and Ba/Ce-modified Ru ACC are within the range 1.8 wt%–2.0 wt% (Table S1). These catalysts were further investigated for NH3 synthesis at 400 °C under 1 MPa with a feed of 25% N2-75% H2 and a weight hourly space velocity of 60000 mL g−1 h−1. Notably, the nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) support showed negligible activity [17], while Ru ACC exhibits an NH3 synthesis rate of 7.5 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1 (Fig. 1(a) ). Anchoring of Ba and/or Ce onto Ru ACC results in a significantly enhanced NH3 synthesis rate. Specifically, bimetallic Ba- and Ce-promoted Ru ACCs display an unprecedentedly high NH3 synthesis rate of 56.2 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1 at 400 °C and 1 MPa, which is significantly higher than either Ba/Ru ACC (34.2 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1) or Ce/Ru ACC (18.0 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1) [17]. Moreover, the NH3 synthesis rate over the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC is approximately 11.4 times higher than that of Cs-promoted Ru/MgO catalyst (4.9 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1, Fig. 1(a)), one of the most active NH3 synthesis catalysts. A comparison of the NH3 synthesis rate over the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC with other previously reported Ru-based catalysts is also presented in Table S2, and it is evident that Ba/Ce/Ru ACC outperforms the reported Ru-based catalysts under similar reaction conditions. For a more realistic comparison, we estimated the turnover frequency (TOFRu), which indicates the activity of a catalyst on a per-Ru active site basis. The Ru dispersion over the catalysts was determined by CO pulse chemisorption (Table S3). As illustrated in Fig. 1(b), the TOFRu surface and TOFRu total of Ru ACC are 0.23 and 0.01 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, anchoring of Ba and/or Ce onto Ru ACC could lead to a significant increase of both TOFRu surface and TOFRu total. Among them, Ba/Ce/Ru ACC displays a TOFRu surface and TOFRu total of 1.21 and 0.08 s−1 (400 °C, 1 MPa), respectively, which are significantly higher than those of Ce/Ru ACC and Ba/Ru ACC. Catalytic stability is a critical requirement for the practical application of atomic cluster catalysts. Therefore, we evaluated the thermal stability of Ru ACC and the best-performing Ba/Ce/Ru ACC. The Ru ACC NH3 synthesis rate remained constant for more than 90 h despite the slight decrease at the initial stage, but it decreased after 105 h. In contrast, there was no obvious deactivation over Ba/Ce/Ru ACC at 400 °C for 140 h, revealing that the addition of Ba and Ce greatly improved the catalytic stability (Fig. S1). The XRD patterns of Ba/Ce/Ru ACC after 140 h are similar to those of the fresh sample (Fig. S2), revealing the absence of bulk transformation. TEM, HR-TEM (Fig. S3), and STEM mapping (Fig. S4) analyses revealed that Ru, Ba, and Ce were still highly dispersed on the N-doped carbon support; there was no Ru agglomeration during the NH3 synthesis reaction. These results demonstrate that Ba/Ce/Ru ACC is not only active but also stable in NH3 synthesis under the adopted reaction conditions. To gain insight into the effect of the promoters in the NH3 synthesis atomic cluster catalyst, kinetic studies were conducted to determine the reaction activation energies (E a) and reaction orders (Figs. 1(c)–(f)). From the results of the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 1(c)), the apparent activation energy was determined to be 60 kJ mol−1 for Ru ACC and in the range 56–75 kJ mol−1 for the Ba- and/or Ce-modified Ru ACCs (Table S4). The low E a values of these atomic cluster catalysts revealed their facile activation of N2 to generate NH3. Meanwhile, the N2 reaction orders (α) of these promoters modifying Ru ACC were almost the same (0.39–0.46, Table S4), indicating similar N2 activation pathways. The low N2 reaction order also suggested that N2 dissociation did not affect the overall reaction rate [17,28]. Furthermore, all the Ba- and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACCs exhibited positive H2 reaction orders (β, Table S4), unlike conventional Ru NP catalysts (β < 0), indicating the elimination of the hydrogen inhibition effect [29]. This conclusion is also supported by the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC NH3 synthesis rate, which displayed an approximately linear response to increasing pressure. For example, when the reaction pressure was increased from 1 to 3 MPa at 400 °C, there was a 1.5-fold increase in the NH3 synthesis rate to 87.1 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1 over the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC. These results indicate the likely absence of Ru poisoning by hydrogen. Moreover, the NH3 reaction order (γ) of Ru ACC is estimated at –0.92 (Table S4), revealing that NH x (x = 1–3) species strongly bind on the catalyst surface [7]. The strong adsorption of NH x species inhibited further hydrogenation and desorption of surface NH3. Impressively, the NH3 reaction order rose to –0.78, –0.64, and –0.44 after Ru ACCs were modified by Ba, Ce, and Ba/Ce, respectively. These results reveal that in the presence of Ba- and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACCs, the electronic interaction between Ru atomic clusters and promoters effectively alleviated NH3 accumulation. This led to faster NH3 product desorption and ultimately contributed to superior NH3 synthesis performance [16]. To further elucidate the effect of the promoters on the electronic, compositional, and structural properties of the catalysts, we conducted detailed investigations on the as-synthesized Ru ACCs. XRD patterns (Fig. S2(a)) showed two broad peaks at 2θ of 24.3° and 43.6° for the as-synthesized Ru catalysts, corresponding to the graphitic (002) plane and the disordered carbon (100) plane, respectively [30]. No diffraction peaks corresponding to metallic Ru were observed. An additional diffraction peak at 23.6° was observed for the Ba/Ru ACC and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC, suggesting that BaCO3 species form after exposure to air. The effects of Ba and/or Ce on Ru ACCs were also explored through Raman and EPR analyses. Fig. S5(a) shows the D band peak at 1585 cm−1 and the G band peak at 1368 cm−1 for Ru ACCs with or without added promoters, corresponding to defective or sp 3 carbon and sp 2-bonded graphitic carbon, respectively [31]. No significant variation in I D/I G ratio was detected between Ru ACC and the modified Ru ACCs (Table S1). This indicates that the incorporation of Ba and/or Ce had minimal impact on the electronic environment of the carbon atoms. EPR (Fig. S5(b)) is an instrumental tool for probing unpaired electron charge distribution, thus providing an electron charge-transfer signal [32,33]. The current Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs exhibit a major, broad EPR peak at g = 2.003, which is asymmetrical widened shape compared to those of the Ru ACCs, revealing the formation of higher unpaired electron charges and increased charge transfer in the promoted catalyst. Moreover, the addition of Ba and/or Ce induced a decrease in the BET specific surface area (Fig. S6) and pore volume (Table S1) over Ce/Ru ACC, Ba/Ru ACC, and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC; this can be attributed to the accumulation of Ba and Ce on the atomic cluster surfaces, where they block the Ru ACC surface pore structure. The TEM images in Fig. S7 reveal the absence of Ru nanoparticles in the Ce/Ru ACCs, Ba/Ru ACCs, and Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs. The distribution of Ru entities was further examined using atomic-resolution AC-STEM, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 2(a) . The AC-STEM images of both Ru ACCs and Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs show bright dots. These indicate the presence of Ru atoms, which are much heavier than C and N atoms. The Ru atom trimers (yellow circles) corresponding to Ru3 atomic clusters are clearly distinguishable. The dimer-like structures (blue circles) correspond to unaligned Ru3 atomic clusters, mainly because the AC-STEM technique provides a two-dimensional projected image [34]. Notably, Fig. 2(b) confirms the presence of Ru atomic cluster structures in the Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs, verifying that Ba- and Ce-doping do not affect the Ru atomic cluster structure. Synchrotron radiation XAFS spectroscopy was employed to probe the Ru atomic cluster structure. Fig. 2(c) shows the Ru K-edge EXAFS spectra of the Ru foils (Ru–Ru coordination), Ru(NH3)6Cl2 (Ru-N coordination), and Ba-and/or Ce-promoted catalysts. Quantitative EXAFS spectral fitting was performed based on the Ru foil and Ru(NH3)6Cl2 crystal structures; the detailed fitting parameters are plotted in Fig. S8 and Table S5. These samples exhibited a strong peak at 1.54 Å, assigned to the Ru-N coordination, with coordination numbers (CNs) in the range of 7.6–7.8 for Ba- and/or Ce-modified Ru ACCs (Table S5). Another peak at 2.5 Å corresponds to Ru–Ru coordination in all these samples; the coordination numbers are in the range of 2.5–2.7. These results revealed that the Ru entities dispersed on the support were in the form of atomic clusters over Ba- and/or Ce-promoted the Ru ACC catalysts, in good agreement with the results of AC-STEM analyses. These results further demonstrate that the Ru atoms are dispersed as Ru atomic clusters stabilized by nitrogen species. Combined with the results of the AC-STEM and EXAFS analyses, it can be concluded that the Ru atomic cluster structure did not change within Ba- and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACCs. Thus, any changes in catalytic activity originated from other factors, such as the electronic structure. The chemical state and electronic structure of the as-synthesized Ru atomic cluster catalysts were further investigated using XANES and XPS studies. Notably, the Ru K-edge XANES spectra showed that the adsorption energy of Ba- and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACC is higher than that of Ru foil and lower than that of RuO2 (Fig. 2(d)), implying that Ru carries a positive charge (Ru δ+, 0 < δ < 4) [35,36]. Compared with Ru ACC, the adsorption energies of Ru K-edge XANES spectra over the Ba and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACCs negatively shift, suggesting the presence of electron transfer from Ba and/or Ce to Ru atoms [37]. The surface chemical states of Ru ACCs and the promoters modifying Ru ACCs were further characterized by the XPS technique. Fig. S9 shows the Ru 3d XPS spectra of Ru ACCs exhibit two weak peaks at 281.3 and 282.9 eV, which can be assigned to metallic Ru and Ru δ+ species, respectively [38]. Anchoring Ba and/or Ce onto Ru ACCs, Ru 3d XPS peaks shifted to lower binding energies, suggesting that Ba and/or Ce could significantly impact the electronic structure of Ru atoms. To verify these electronic interactions further, Ru 3p XPS spectra were recorded. Ru 3p XPS spectra at 461.6/483.6 eV and 463.1/485.1 eV (Fig. 3(a) ) correspond to Ru metal and Ru δ+ species, respectively [39]. The Ru binding energies (B.E.s) over Ba/Ru ACCs, Ce/Ru ACCs, and Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs also show a slight negative shift compared with Ru ACCs, suggesting that Ru species possess a lower valance state after being modified by Ba and Ce. This finding highlights electron transfer from Ba and/or Ce to Ru atoms [40], which is in agreement with the XANES analysis. Notably, Ba/Ce/Ru ACC exhibits the largest negative shift of B.E. value (0.2 eV) among various atomic clusters catalysts, indicating a higher electron density of Ru atoms after being modified by Ba and Ce. Additionally, the C 1s XPS spectrum contained three major carbon configurations: C−C (284.8 eV), C−N (285.6 eV), and C=O (287.4 eV) (Fig. S10) [41]. Notably, the binding energies (288.7–288.8 eV) and amounts of C–N bonds (11%–13%, Table S6) are extremely similar over Ru ACCs and Ba- and/or Ce-promoted Ru ACCs, revealing that Ba and/or Ce promoters do not change the electronic structure of the N-doped carbon support. Taken together, these results confirm the synergistic electronic interactions between Ba and/or Ce and the Ru atomic clusters, leading to charge redistribution in the Ru atoms after the introduction of the Ba and Ce promoters. The Ba 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 3(b)) of Ba/Ru ACC and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC were deconvoluted into two peaks: One corresponds to the perovskite-like phase at 779.8 eV and the other to Ba bonded to O (BaO) at 778.7 eV [42]. Deconvolution of the Ba 3d XPS spectra revealed that BaO accounted for nearly 90% of the signal, whereas only a negligible quantity of perovskite-like species was present in either Ba/Ru ACC or Ba/Ce/Ru ACC (Table S6). Importantly, the addition of the Ce species resulted in a slight shift in the Ba 3d signal toward a higher B.E., suggesting a strong electronic interaction between Ba and Ce in the case of Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs. For Ce 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 3(c)), surface Ce3+ species are identified at 883.0 eV and 901.3 eV, while the other peaks correspond to different Ce4+ electron configurations [43]. It is worth noting that the surface concentration of Ce3+ over the Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs is higher than that of Ce/Ru ACCs (Table S6), indicating that the introduction of Ba species could promote the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ species, due primarily to a strong electronic interaction formation between Ba and Ce over the Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs. This observation was consistent with the findings obtained from the Ba 3d XPS spectra. A higher surface Ce3+ concentration is associated with the presence of more oxygen vacancies, which can react with hydrides to generate hydroxyl groups and vacate hydrogen species at the Ru active sites, thus providing sufficient Ru active sites for the activation of N2 [44]. Consequently, Ba/Ce/Ru ACC, with its higher concentration of surface Ce3+, exhibits higher activity for NH3 synthesis than does Ce/Ru ACC (Fig. 1(a)). H2-TPR experiments were performed to investigate the effects of Ba and/or Ce on the reducibility of Ru ACC (Fig. S11). The H2-TPR profile of Ru ACC displays a distinct peak at 180 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Ru δ+ to metallic Ru species [45]. The corresponding H2 consumption amount was determined by the H2-TPR curve to be 0.68 mmol g−1 (Table S3). When Ba and/or Ce was added to Ru ACC, no obvious differences were observed in reduction temperatures (180–183 °C) or H2 consumption amounts (0.60–0.77 mmol g−1) over these Ba- and/or Ce-modified Ru ACCs catalysts, suggesting that Ba and/or Ce species have an insignificant effect on the reaction behavior of Ru atomic clusters. To further investigate the impact of the electronic interactions between Ba and/or Ce and Ru atomic clusters on N≡N bond activation over Ba/Ce/Ru ACC, in situ DRIFTS of N2 adsorption analyses were performed on Ru ACC, Ba/Ru ACC, Ce/Ru ACC, and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC (Fig. S12). In the infrared spectrum of Ru ACC, two peaks were observed at 2358 and 2216 cm−1, which are identified as those of N2 adsorbed on metallic Ru0 and Ru δ+ sites (affected by intra-cluster interaction), respectively [46]. Upon the addition of Ba and Ce, the relative intensities of these two bands gradually increased. The adsorption strength, which reflected the adsorbed N2 surface coverage, was related to the ability of Ru atoms to donate electron density to the N2 antibonding π* orbital. On both Ru0 and Ru δ+ sites, this increased adsorbed N2 peak strength indicates an effective electronic interaction between Ru atomic clusters and the promoters. Notably, Ba/Ce/Ru ACC exhibits the highest relative N2 adsorption amount, suggesting its stronger electronic interaction between the promoters and Ru atomic clusters. These findings provide direct evidence that the presence of electronic interactions between the Ba, Ce, and Ru atomic clusters enhances the electron transfer ability of the Ru atoms, thereby promoting the activation of N2. Monitoring the structural variation of Ba/Ce/Ru ACC in a real reaction environment sheds some light on the behavior of Ba and Ce on Ru atomic clusters. Quasi-in situ XPS analyses were carried out to discern any changes in the local electronic structures of the best-performing Ba/Ce/Ru ACC. From the Ru 3p XPS spectra in Fig. 4(a) , we observed that the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC displays a significant increase in Ru0 species ratio after H2 treatment at 400 °C (Table S7), resulting in an elevated electron density in Ru atoms. The subsequent 25% N2-75% H2 treatment at 400 °C results in decreased surface Ru0 species concentration, indicating that Ru effectively donated electrons to N2 molecules. In the case of the Ba 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 4(b)), the binding energies of the BaO B.E.s increased after the sample was treated with either H2 or a 25% N2-75% H2 atmosphere, suggesting that BaO has a significant electron donation effect during the NH3 synthesis process. Meanwhile, the Ce 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 4(c)) revealed a decrease in the surface Ce4+ to Ce3+ species upon H2 atmosphere exposure, resulting in the generation of more surface Ce3+ (Table S7). The resulting Ce3+ species transferred electrons to Ru atoms, enhancing the Ru atom electron densities and facilitating N2 activation. This phenomenon was evidenced by the decrease in surface Ce3+ during the subsequent 25% N2-75% H2 treatment (Table S7). Fig. 4(d) shows the characteristic absorption peaks of N-containing intermediates identified by in situ DRIFTS under a 25% N2-75% D2 atmosphere, confirming the N2 activation pathway in NH3 synthesis over the catalysts. As expected, the absorption peaks of Ru ACC, Ba/Ru ACC, Ce/Ru ACC, and Ba/Ce/Ru ACC are consistent with the previously reported Ru atomic clusters catalysts [17]. All samples exhibit a peak at 2371 cm−1, attributed to the N–D stretching vibration of N2D2 on Ru active sites, and another band at 1599 cm−1 ascribed to the N=N stretching of N2D x . The presence of N2D x intermediates on the Ru sites effectively demonstrates that N2 can be hydrogenated stepwise to form NH3 over Ru ACC and the modified Ru ACC. This result indicates that associative pathway N2 activation over Ru ACC is not influenced by the electronic interaction of Ba and Ce on the Ru atomic clusters, and the electronic interaction accelerates N2 activation on Ru entities. 4 Conclusions In summary, we presented a simple, facile strategy to achieve a highly efficient, stable Ru ACC (2 wt% Ru) for NH3 synthesis by doping of Ba, Ce, or Ba/Ce. The presentCMEI between the Ru atomic clusters and Ba, Ce, and Ba/Ce is critical for promoting the NH3 synthesis rate. At 400 °C and 1 MPa, Ba/Ce/Ru ACC displays a high NH3 synthesis rate of 56.2 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1. The combined XPS and in situ DRIFTS results demonstrated that the CMEI affected the electronic properties of the Ru atoms, promoting electron transfer ability and favoring N2 activation. Importantly, the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC exhibits the electronic synergistic effect between Ba, Ce, and Ru atomic clusters. It evidently presents more charge donations to Ru atoms, resulting in its superior NH3 synthesis rate. This study offers insights into the role of CMEI in promoting the effectiveness of Ru ACC. Additionally, this study paves the way for a potential catalyst that can stimulate NH3 synthesis at low temperatures and pressures using renewable energy.

        "dc:description": "Ammonia (NH3) is an excellent candidate for hydrogen storage and transport. However, producing NH3 under mild conditions is a long-term, arduous task. Atomic cluster catalysts (ACCs) have been shown to be effective for catalytic N2-to-NH3 conversion, opening the door to the development of efficient catalysts under mild conditions. Still, ACC formation with thermally stable catalytic sites remains a challenge because of their high surface free energy. Herein, we report anchoring Ba and/or Ce onto Ru ACCs (2 wt% Ru atomic clusters supported on N-doped carbon) to form so-called clusters–metal oxide promoters electronic interaction (CMEI) to stabilize the Ru atomic clusters. The resulting Ba/Ce/Ru ACCs significantly boost the NH3 synthesis rate to 56.2 mmolNH3 gcat −1 h−1 at 400 °C and 1 MPa, which is 7.5-fold higher than that of Ru ACC. The strengthened CMEI between the Ba/Ce and Ru atomic clusters across the Ba/Ce/Ru ACC enables electron transfer from Ba and/or Ce to Ru atomic clusters. As such, the electron-enriched Ru atom could facilitate electron transfer to N≡N bond π* orbitals, which would weaken the N≡N bond and drive the eventual conversion of N2 to NH3. This study offers insight into the role of CMEI in Ru ACCs and provides an effective approach for designing stable atomic cluster catalysts for NH3 synthesis.",
