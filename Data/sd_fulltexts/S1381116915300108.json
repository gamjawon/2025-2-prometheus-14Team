Graphical abstract Crystallite size was found to determine catalytic performance for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX, and the optimum crystallite size of the catalyst was found to be about 5μm, considering both ET conversion and TMB recovery yield. Pt/H-ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al ratio of 50) with a Pt loading of 0.28wt.% were successfully synthesized and employed as catalysts for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX). Five different crystallite sizes (40, 20, 10, 5, 2μm) were prepared using different aging times before crystallization. The influence of crystallite size on catalytic activity was investigated, and the catalysts synthesized were physicochemically characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, and ICP-OES. Hydrodealkylation was performed in a conventional fixed bed reactor, and the influences of crystallite size on ethyltoluene (ET) isomer conversion and on the recovery yields of trimethylbenzene (TMB) isomers were examined. Conversion of ET isomers was always higher than that of TMB isomers. The distribution of products obtained was strongly influenced by Pt/H-ZSM-5 crystallite size, that is, ET isomer conversion decreased and TMB isomer recovery yield increased with crystallite size. Catalyst crystallite size was found to dictate catalytic activity with respect to selective hydrodealkylation. Pt/H-ZSM-5 with a crystallite size of 5μm exhibited the best catalytic performance for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX. Keywords Pt/H-ZSM-5 Hydrodealkylation C9+ aromatics BTX Crystallite size 1 Introduction Zeolites have been broadly used as heterogeneous catalysts in the oil refining and petrochemical industries [1]. In particular, ZSM-5 type zeolites are known as shape selective catalysts due to their distinctive channel structures formed by 10-membered rings [2,3]. For this reason, large molecules cannot diffuse efficiently through these microporous materials because of their small pore sizes [4]. Furthermore, ZSM-5 catalysts show much greater selectivity for para-isomers than ortho- or meta-isomers during xylene isomerization, the alkylation of toluene by methanol, and toluene disproportionation [5]. Moreover, Pt treated ZSM-5 catalysts are suitable for the hydrodealkylation of aromatics to BTX [6]. Aromatic compounds have been widely applied in the petrochemical and fine chemical industries, and C9+ aromatics, which consist of small amount of xylene isomers, ET isomers, TMB isomers, and tetramethylbenzene (TeMB) isomers, can be converted to BTX, useful raw materials [7]. In addition, 1,3,5-TMB and 1,2,4-TMB (both C9+ aromatics) are useful industrially. 1,3,5-TMB is a major reaction intermediate in the preparation of trimesic acid (or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid), and, possibly in the form of its anhydride, is used to produce plasticizers for polymers and polymidic, epoxy, and polyester resins [8]. On the other hand, 1,2,4-TMB is used mainly as the raw material for the production of trimellitic anhydride, and is also used to produce pharmaceuticals and dyes [9]. 1,2,4-TMB is obtained by distillation from reforming hydrocarbon streams, in which it is present at high concentrations. However, 1,3,5-TMB cannot be recovered in the same way, because of presence of other organics, such as, methylethylbenzene (MEB) isomers, with similar volatilities. For this reason, selective removal of alkyl group bonded to benzene ring by MFI based catalysts has been actively studied [10–13]. In this study, a series of Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different crystallite sizes were synthesized and characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, and ICP-OES, and subjected to catalytic performance tests for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX. We focused on both ET conversion and TMB recovery yields and we discuss relationships between the crystallite sizes of the as-prepared catalysts and their catalytic activities. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of Pt/H-ZSM-5 1g NaOH (98wt.%, Samchun) was dissolved in 120ml of water, and to this solution, 6g of TPABr (98wt.%, Sigma–Aldrich) was added with stirring. Sodium aluminate (0.8g; 53wt% Al2O3, 43wt% Na2O, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in this mixture over 30min, and then 25.2g of silica (91.8% SiO2, Zeosil 77, KoFran) was added slowly. The mixture was then aged by stirring at 500rpm for 0, 0.5, 12, 24, and 96h at 70°C. The slurry obtained was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and crystallized in an autoclave at 170°C for 24h. As-synthesized samples were washed several times with distilled water to remove impurities. The sodium form of zeolite obtained was then converted into the protonic form by ammonium exchange using an aqueous solution (0.04wt.%) of NH4Cl at 80°C for 12h, followed by washing and drying. Thereafter, platinum was impregnated into synthesized zeolite using an aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 at 50°C for 8h, as previously described [10]. Finally, the of Pt/H-ZSM-5 zeolites were washed several times with distilled water, and calcined calcined at 200°C for 16h. Synthesized Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are denoted as Pt/H-ZSM-5(X) (where X =0∼96), according to aging time. 2.2 Physical characterization The crystallinity of prepared samples was investigated by an X-ray diffraction using Ni filtered Cu KK radiation (XRD, Rigaku, D/max-2200), and their morphologies and crystallite sizes were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4300). Chemical compositions of the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 7300DV). Specific surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore size were determined using the N2 adsorption method (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) at 77K. 2.3 Performance of catalysts Selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX was carried out in a conventional fixed bed reactor to evaluate the activities of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 1 . C9+ aromatic mixtures containing xylene, ET isomers, TMB isomers, and TeMB isomers were used as feed stocks (Table 1 ). Catalyst (171mg) was loaded in the constant temperature zone of a reactor using quartz wool. Prior to reaction, catalyst was activated at 400°C for 1.5h under flowing of 4ml/min hydrogen for the reduction of Pt. And then, C9+ aromatics and hydrogen (1:2) were injected in to the reactor at the constant pressure. The reaction was conducted at various temperatures (370, 390, 410, 430, and 450) and atmospheric pressure. Products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent, 6890A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). ET Conversion and TMB recovery yield were calculated using the following equations. ET conversion ( % ) = ET in re ac tan t − ET in product ET in rea c tan t × 100 TMB re cover y yield ( % ) = TMB in product TMB in reac tant × 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts SEM was used to determine the morphologies and crystallite sizes of the prepared catalysts (Fig. 2 ). With respect to aging time, that is, 0min, 30min, 12h, 24h, and 96h, crystallite sizes were ca. 40, 20 10, 5, and 2μm, respectively. This result can be explained by the relation between aging time and nucleation. In other words, as the aging time of the mixed slurry before crystallization was increased, more nuclei formed, which lead to the development of different crystallite sizes. Similar results were observed by Alfaro et al. [14]. Whereas, no significant difference in crystallite shape was detected, variable crystallite sizes were obtained by changing aging time, as confirmed in Fig. 2. Table 2 summarizes Pt loading amount determined by ICP-OES and average pore diameters, BET surface areas, internal surface areas, external surface areas, micropore volumes, and mesopore volumes with respect to crystallite sizes. The Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts produced had almost the same amount of Pt and BET surface areas. Furthermore, Pt loading amount were in good agreement with the designed value, and BET surface areas were consistent with typical values previously reported [15,16]. The N2 adsorption revealed that external and internal surface area were strongly dependent on crystallite sizes, that is, as crystallite size decreased, external surface area was increased and internal (pore) surface area decreased, which concurs with the findings of a previous study [17]. The XRD patterns of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with respect to crystallite size are shown in Fig. 3 . All catalysts had the typical crystalline structure of ZSM-5 [18], and no other phase was observed, indicating that Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were successfully synthesized. The crystallinity of Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as determined by diffraction peaks around 7.5–9.5°, reduced as crystallite size decreased probably due to disruption of the microporous structure of ZSM-5 associated with a smaller crystallite size. This finding is consistent with the observed decrease in pore surface area and micro pore volume (Table 2). 3.2 Catalytic activities of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts The catalytic performances of Pt/H-ZSM-5(X) (X =0.5 and 24) catalysts as a function of reaction temperature for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX performed over 3h are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. Both ET conversion and TMB recovery yield remained unchanged with reaction temperature, but ET conversion of Pt/H-ZSM-5(0.5) was much lower than that of Pt/H-ZSM-5(24) at all temperature ranges investigated. This is believed to have been caused by increases in the diffusion rates of ET isomers and in external surface area caused by the smaller crystallite size of the Pt/H-ZSM-5. Also, since ortho-ET has a relatively large molecular diameter as compared with para-ET, diffusion of para-ET into catalyst pores is more rapid [19]. Thus, Pt/H-ZSM-5(24) with a relatively large external surface area exhibited higher ET conversion than Pt/H-ZSM-5(0.5). Product distributions among benzene, toluene, and xylene over Pt/H-ZSM-5(X) (X =0.5 and 24) catalysts were analyzed after a reaction time of 3h and plotted as a function of reaction temperature (Fig. 5 ). Although, both ET conversion and TMB recovery yield were almost same at different reaction temperatures (Fig. 4), the BTX product distribution changed. As the reaction temperature increased, the production of toluene and xylene decreased, and benzene production increased. This result was ascribed to the increase of dealkylation with reaction temperature, and concurs with the findings of a previous study regarding the influence of temperature on the formation of benzene and toluene during xylene isomerization [20]. In addition, the sum of all BTX products for the Pt/H-ZSM-5(24) was greater than that of Pt/H-ZSM-5(0.5) at each reaction temperature due to the decrease in TMB recovery yield, as shown in Fig 4. It can be concluded that BTX are produced by not only the hydrodealkylation of ET but also dealkylation of TMB, and BTX product distribution is strongly affected by reaction temperature. The correlation between catalyst crystallite size and catalytic activity for the hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics at 410°C after 3h reaction is shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that ET conversion increased and TMB recovery yield decreased with decreasing crystallite size. These results imply that ET conversion increased on increasing catalyst external surface area by reducing crystallite size. However, undesirable dealkylation of TMB also increased with increasing catalyst external surface area, resulting in reduced TMB recovery yields. Furthermore, TMB conversion was found to be lower than ET conversion, which can be explained by two factors. (1) TMB isomers could not diffuse as rapidly into the pores of ZSM-5 [19] and (2) the difference between the dissociation energies of alkyl groups on the benzene ring. Although cleavage off an ethyl cation, which is subsequently rapidly deprotonated to ethene and hydrogenated to ethane over Pt, from protonated ET is viable, no methyl cation can be split off protonated toluene or protonated ET due to the poor stability of the carbenium ion [21]. Therefore, the hydrodealkylation of ET isomers to toluene and ethane is kinetically strongly preferred, as has been reported by Serra et al. [22]. Consequently, the optimum crystallite size of the catalyst was found to be about 5μm, at which ET conversion was 94.3% and TMB recovery yield was 92.3%. 4 Conclusions A series of Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different crystallite sizes (40, 20 10, 5, and 2μm) were prepared and then used for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX. External and internal surface areas were strongly dependent on crystallite size, and external surface area was increased and internal (pore) surface area decreased with the decrease of crystallite size. ET conversion over Pt/H-ZSM-5 increased as crystallite size decreased, whereas TMB isomer recovery yields decreased. Crystallite size was found to determine catalytic performance for the selective hydrodealkylation of C9+ aromatics to BTX, and the optimum crystallite size of the catalyst was found to be about 5μm, considering both ET conversion and TMB recovery yield.
