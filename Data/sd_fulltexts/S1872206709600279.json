Methane Combustion over Pd/Al 2 O 3 Catalyst: Effects of Chlorine Ions and Water on Catalytic Activity GAO Diannan 1,2 , WANG Sheng 1 , ZHANG Chunxi 1 , YUAN Zhongshan 1 , WANG Shudong 1, * 1 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, China 2 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China Abstract: The influences of residual chlorine ions and water on the performance of a Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst in methane combustion have been studied. The results show that the catalyst containing Cl exhibits a relatively low activity, and the addition of water to the reaction system accelerates the deactivation process. The catalyst has been characterized by N 2 adsorption, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetry (TG). The results show that the presence of Cl appears to strongly inhibit the total oxidation of methane and hinder the dispersion of Pd on Al 2 O 3 . The formation of Pd(OH) 2 during the reaction is the most likely reason for the inhi- bition effect of water, which is confirmed by FT-IR and TG analysis. The regeneration of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst can be achieved by purging in nitrogen at 550 °C. Key words: palladium; alumina; methane; catalytic combustion; deactivation; regeneration; chlorine ion; water vapor Catalytic combustion has many advantages compared with conventional flame combustion. In the catalytic combustion the emission of NO x is greatly diminished, and a high energy efficiency can also be obtained during the combustion of lean fuels [1–5]. Methane is a hydrocarbon that is most difficult to undergo oxidation and requires much higher oxidation temperatures than other alkanes, especially in lean methane-air mixtures (such as in mine ventilation air). The technology of lean methane combustion has been studied in recent years. Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts are widely known to be active for methane combus- tion [6,7]. There are numerous studies about the relationship between the activity of Pd/Al 2 O 3 with the state of Pd, the interaction of support with the active component, the Pd loading, and the size of Pd [8–10]. However, few reports are concerned with the influence of Cl and H 2 O and the regeneration of catalysts. Simplicio et al. [11] found that the precursors and the prepara- tion route can induce changes in the dispersion of Pd and the activity of catalysts. Cant et al. [12] and Marceau et al. [2] reported that residual chlorine inhibits the methane combustion activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 . Pieck et al. [13] confirmed that this inhi- bition also exists in Pd/Al 2 O 3 . In addition, no clear consensus regarding the deactivation reason has been reached. Narui et al. [14] explained the poor stability by sintering of PdO particles during operation. Other researchers considered that the deac- tivation of Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts was caused by the formation of Pd(OH) 2 [15–17]; however, there is no forceful evidence to prove it. In this study, we have systematically investigated the in- fluence of Cl and water vapor on the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst per- formance. Furthermore, the cause of deactivation of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was discussed based on the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetry (TG). 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation In a previous study [18], we noticed that Al 2 O 3 pellets cal- cined at 1100 °C have best thermal stability. Hence, we chose this Al 2 O 3 (16–20 mesh; including impurities of 0.419% Na 2 O, 0.176% SiO 2 , 0.338% CaO, 0.034% Fe 2 O 3 , 0.028% SO 2 4 , and 0.015% Cl ; surface area 37.81 m 2 /g; average pore size 16.48 nm) as the support. Its Cl content was very low. Pd/Al 2 O 3 Gao Diannan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1221–1225 catalysts with a Pd loading of 2% were prepared by impregna- tion of Al 2 O 3 pellets with Pd precursor solutions. The im- pregnated samples were dried at 120 ºC for 12 h and then calcined at 600 ºC for 2 h. The Pd/Al 2 O 3 samples prepared using Pd(NO 3 ) 2 and PdCl 2 precursors were denoted catalyst A and catalyst B, respectively. Catalyst C was obtained by washing catalyst B with distilled water several times until no Cl was detected and then drying at 120 ºC for 12 h again. 1.2 Catalyst characterization The surface area of the Al 2 O 3 pellets was measured by the BET method with N 2 adsorption using a Quantachrome NOVA 2200e instrument, and the samples were degassed in vacuum for at least 2 h at 200 ºC prior to analysis. Pd dispersion on the catalyst was evaluated by measure- ments of CO pulse adsorption in a helium flow after reduction in 10% H 2 /Ar at 450 ºC for 2 h. The catalyst surface was made clean in a flow of helium at 450 ºC for 2 h. The Pd dispersion (D Pd ) was calculated from the total CO uptake by assuming that CO was adsorbed on surface Pd atoms at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. The Pd content was measured by the UV-spectrophotometric method, and the Cl content was measured by X-ray fluores- cence (XRF) using a Philips Magix 601 analyzer. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR instrument. The spectrometer collected 32 spectra in the range of 4000–600 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 . TG analysis was conducted with a Perkin Elmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA instrument in a N 2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 ºC/min. 1.3 Catalyst evaluation The catalytic activity was examined using a fixed-bed re- actor at atmospheric pressure and at a space velocity of 160000 h 1 . A lean fuel gas containing 0.4% CH 4 and balancing air was supplied to the catalyst bed through mass flow controllers (Sevenstar Hua Chuang Company, Beijing, China). Composi- tions of the feed gas and the combustion flue gas were analyzed using an online GC7890 gas chromatograph with an FID de- tector (Tianmei Chromatograph Ltd, Shanghai, China). Prior to each run, the catalyst was reduced in a 2% hydrazine solution for 24 h. In addition, the catalyst can also be reduced at 450 ºC in a 10% H 2 /N 2 mixture. The activity and stability of the cata- lysts were tested in reactants at 550 ºC. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of Cl on Pd/Al 2 O 3 activity for CH 4 combustion The main characteristics of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts are listed in Table 1. The specific surface area was found to be fairly the same for all samples and close to that of the alumina support. This indicates that neither the preparation process nor the aging treatment under reactants affects the alumina BET value, and the eventual changes in catalytic properties for methane oxi- dation do not originate from the surface transformation of the alumina support. Catalyst A prepared from the nitrate precursor contain trace Cl (0.014%, originating from Al 2 O 3 support). Catalyst B prepared from PdCl 2 still contained 0.35% Cl after calcination in air at 600 ºC. The content of Cl in catalyst C decreased to 0.017%. As there is trace Cl in catalysts A and C, the effect of Cl can be ignored. The Pd dispersion of the three samples measured from CO pulse chemisorption is in the order C > A > B. This suggests that the presence of Cl can signifi- cantly affect the metal surface accessible to CO, and therefore the measured dispersion of catalyst B is lower. After removal of Cl , Pd dispersion of catalyst C from PdCl 2 was found to be higher than that of catalyst B from Pd(NO 3 ) 2 , in agreement with the literature report [19]. After 40 h reaction, the content of Cl in catalyst B was below the detection limit of XRF, and the metal dispersion had almost no change. The catalytic activity of catalysts A, B, and C is compared as a function of reaction time in Fig. 1. It can be clearly seen that catalysts A and C, in which the Cl content is low, have high initial activity, and the activity of C is higher than A. In addi- tion, the activity of catalysts A and C slowly decreased with reaction time. Catalyst B containing high Cl content showed Table 1 Physicochemical properties of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts Catalyst Precursor Pd loading (%) Cl content (%) D Pd (%) A BET (m 2 /g) A Pd(NO 3 ) 2 1.80 0.014 34.38 38.21 B PdCl 2 1.65 0.350 28.36 37.65 C PdCl 2 1.68 0.017 40.60 37.87 Aged B PdCl 2 � 0.000 26.18 37.48 Fig. 1.

Gao Diannan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1221–1225 poor activity at first, but the activity increased with time on stream because of the gradual removal of Cl . A maximum was reached after 13 h, and then the activity slowly decreased with time. These results suggest that Cl can act as a strong inhibitor of the catalytic combustion of methane by blocking the chemisorption sites. Residual chlorine cannot be totally re- moved from the support by calcination, so a washing step after calcination is necessary to get chloride anions eliminated. 2.2 Effect of water vapor on Pd/Al 2 O 3 activity for CH 4 combustion The effect of water vapor on the catalyst activity toward CH 4 combustion has been studied and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The activity is presented in terms of methane conversion versus time-on-stream where 10% water vapor was periodically added to the feed stream. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the methane conversion remained constant under dry conditions. However, when extra water was introduced into the feed, the activity remarkably decreased. When water was removed, the activity increased slightly but not to the initial level before the water introduction. By repeating this process, it was found that the rate of activity loss increased, and the slope of the activity curve became steeper. After three repetitions the methane conversion over Pd/Al 2 O 3 decreased from 99% to 94%, and the activity was difficult to be recovered to the initial level. We can conclude that the introduction of water vapor enhances the deactivation of Pd/Al 2 O 3 , which is in agreement with Araya et al. [16]. 2.3 Regeneration of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst The results of regeneration of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. The methane conversion was measured during the reaction for 2 h at 550 ºC using a feed containing 10% water vapor. Then the catalyst was purged with nitrogen or air in the absence of feed for another 2 h. This cycle was repeated three times. Under the wet conditions the activity of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst remarkably decreased. The methane conversion dropped by 15% after 2 h reaction. When methane was turned on again after purging, it was found that the activity of the catalyst was recovered. Furthermore, it appears that nitrogen is better than air because the conversion over the catalyst purged with nitrogen almost reached its original value. As for the deactivation of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, some re- searchers have explained that the poor stability is caused by the sintering of Pd [14], and other researchers have suggested a competition of H 2 O with CH 4 for surface active sites leading to the formation of Pd(OH) 2 at PdO surface sites [15–17]. The Pd dispersions of fresh and aged catalysts were 38.48% and 36.75%, respectively, indicating that there was almost no change in the Pd dispersion, and purging the aged catalyst with nitrogen or air cannot lead to Pd re-dispersion. Therefore, it is shown that the decrease of activity was not due to the sintering of Pd. The second explanation agrees therefore well with our experimental results. Because there was 10% water vapor in the feed, the methane conversion decreased because of an increasing amount of Pd(OH) 2 . When the catalyst was purged in nitrogen or air at 550 °C, Pd(OH) 2 decomposed into PdO. The formation of PdO 2 in air can explain why nitrogen is better than air for recovering the activity of Pd/Al 2 O 3 . In a previous study, PdO 2 was considered not active for methane combustion [19]. 2.4 In situ FT-IR results In situ FT-IR studies were performed to investigate the water inhibition. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the FT-IR spectra of Pd/Al 2 O 3 Fig. 2. Effects of 10% water vapor pulse on the methane combustion activity of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Reaction conditions: 0.4% methane in air, GHSV=160000 h 1 , 550 °C. Fig. 3. Regeneration of the activity of Pd/Al 2 O 3 by purging with nitrogen or air. (1) Recovered by N 2 ; (2) Recovered by Air. Reaction conditions: 0.4% methane in air, 10% H 2 O, GHSV=160000 h 1 , 550 °C. Gao Diannan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2008, 29(12): 1221–1225 under dry and wet conditions at 250 ºC. In Fig. 4(a) some representative spectra are displayed, which were collected at various times after the feed introduction. At time 0 min the feed was introduced into the sample room, and therefore no peaks are observed in the spectrum. After the feed was introduced for 1 min, weak peaks at 3770, 3723, and 3680 cm 1 appeared, which are assigned to OH species on Al 2 O 3 [19,20]. The low intensity peaks located at 3556, 3697, and 3733 cm 1 are as- cribed to the OH species on PdO. At 3014 cm 1 a discrete peak is observed, which arises due to gas phase CH 4 . The peaks of 2800–3000 cm 1 are attributed to the vibrational bands of CH 3 (ad) and CH 2 (ad) [21]. Furthermore, the intensity of these peaks almost did not change as the reaction proceeded, indi- cating that no changes occurred on the catalyst surface. The spectra of Pd/Al 2 O 3 under wet conditions are illustrated in Fig. 4(b). During the course of the experiment the spectra changed considerably. A broad band appeared at 3445 cm 1 , which was attributed to the stretching vibration of H-bonded hydroxyl groups on Al 2 O 3 [22]. The intensity of all the hy- droxyl peaks increased as the reaction proceeded, indicating that the catalyst was covered with H 2 O. The intensity of the peak at 3014 cm 1 increased simultaneously with the hydroxyl peak, indicating that the methane conversion had decreased. This is in line with our experimental results and confirms the second explanation about the deactivation mechanism. 2.5 TG results The TG curves of the fresh catalyst and the catalyst reacted for 4 h under wet conditions are shown in Fig. 5. It is clear that the two catalysts had similar weight loss curves, indicating that they had similar structure. The initial weight loss below 100 ºC can be assigned to the loss of water, and the aged catalyst contains more water than the fresh catalyst. The second weight loss at 630 ºC was caused by the decomposition of PdO. It is also shown in Fig. 5 that the aged catalyst exhibited a slight weight loss at 220 ºC, which can be attributed to the decom- position of Pd(OH) 2 , in agreement with the report of Card et al. [23]. Based on the FT-IR and TG results, we assume that the formation of Pd(OH) 2 and the coverage of the catalyst surface with hydroxyl groups caused the catalyst deactivation under wet conditions. 3 Conclusions The Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst containing Cl exhibits relatively low activity because Cl can block the chemisorption sites and decrease the dispersion of Pd on Al 2 O 3 . The catalytic per- formance of the catalyst can be improved by washing the catalyst after calcination to eliminate chloride anions. The activity decreases abruptly when the water vapor is added to the feed stream. Based on the FT-IR and TG results, the cause of the water inhibition is suggested to be the formation of inactive Pd(OH) 2 and hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, which block access to the PdO sites. This process is reversible, and the catalyst activity can be regenerated by the desorption of hydroxyl and the decomposition of Pd(OH) 2 . Fig. 4.

        "dc:description": "The influences of residual chlorine ions and water on the performance of a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in methane combustion have been studied. The results show that the catalyst containing Cl− exhibits a relatively low activity, and the addition of water to the reaction system accelerates the deactivation process. The catalyst has been characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetry (TG). The results show that the presence of Cl− appears to strongly inhibit the total oxidation of methane and hinder the dispersion of Pd on Al2O3. The formation of Pd(OH)2 during the reaction is the most likely reason for the inhibition effect of water, which is confirmed by FT-IR and TG analysis. The regeneration of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst can be achieved by purging in nitrogen at 550 °C.",
