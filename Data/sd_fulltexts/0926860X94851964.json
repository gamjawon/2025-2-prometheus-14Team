Introduction In the petroleum industry, aromatics production is an important process for increasing the octane rating of gasoline and for producing petrochemicals. The conventional reforming catalysts (platinum on chlorided alumina) are very effective for converting C9 and higher hydrocarbons into aromatics. However, the selectivity of these catalysts in promoting the aromatization of C6 and C7 hydrocarbons, especially n-hexane and n-heptane, is quite poor. Recently, platinum particles in nonacidic zeolite L were found to exhibit a high activity and selectivity for nhexane and n-heptane aromatization [ 1-3 ] . The absence of acidity in the Pt/ zeolite L suggests that this catalyst is monofunctional with the reforming reactions taking place only on the platinum particles [2] . * Corresponding author. Tel.

Guerrero-Ruiz /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 271-278 Many studies have been conducted to find out why the Pt/zeolite L catalyst is so active and selective for lighter alkane dehydrogenation [ 4-15 ] . Two opposing hypotheses have been proposed to explain this particular catalytic behaviour. The initial proposal was that the interaction of the platinum particles with alkaline cations within L-zeolite channels caused the particles to become electron rich [4]. Later studies [6,7,11,14] confirmed that the zeolite environment modifies the electronic properties of the metal particles. Alternative proposals relate the improved selectivity to the geometry of the zeolite support [5,8]. One explanation [8], the molecular die catalysis, proposes that the L-zeolite channels aperture size collimates diffusing reactant molecules and leads to preferential terminal adsorption, which favours 1,6-ring closure and terminal cracking. Another geometric explanation, the confinement model [ 5 ] , suggests that L-zeolite channels preorganize n-hexane into a pseudocycle that resembles the 1,6-ring closure transition state. This proposal could also account for the increased 1,5-ring closure selectivities on zeolites with channels slightly smaller than L zeolite [ 9 ] . Very recently, it has been reported that platinum clusters supported on a hydrotalcite-derived magnesia catalyze the n-hexane aromatization with an activity and selectivity similar to Pt/KL [10]. The authors of this article speculated about a bifunctional mechanism in which basic sites on the support supplement platinum metal sites. However, later extensive studies [ 12,13,15 ] have shown that metalsupport interactions and bifunctional catalysis involving basic sites are not important for the aromatization reaction. Thus, platinum in L-zeolite behaves just like platinum on other nonacidic supports, such as MgO Or Si02, provided there is no difference in metal particle size. Very small particles exhibit the same high activity and selectivity for converting alkanes into aromatics [ 12 ] . Also, it is proposed that L-zeolite is unique in its ability to prevent agglomeration and carbon fouling of the platinum particles at the dehydrogenation reaction conditions [ 13 ] . In an attempt to develop some understanding of the physicochemical parameters that are responsible for the high aromatization selectivities from light n-alkanes, a study of the reactivity of n-heptane over a series of Pt/activated carbon catalysts, with metallic dispersion in the range of 0.05 to 0.68, was undertaken to discern how the activity and selectivity are affected by the platinum crystallite size. Furthermore, the influence of a basic function (Mg0) on the catalytic behaviour was examined on a Pt,MgO/activated carbon sample. 2. Experimental The preparation and characterization of the catalysts have been described elsewhere [ 16] . The support materials were activated carbons produced at the laboratory with a porosity which is essentially microporous. The platinum-containing catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness technique using solutions of H2PtC16 - 6H20 or Pt (NH3) 4Cl2 in a mixture of benzene and ethanol (4:1 in vol- 1. Rodriguet-Ramos, A. Guerrero-Ruiz /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 271-278 273 ume) or water. All the catalysts have about 1 wt.-% Pt loading. The sample containing also the basic function MgO, was prepared by a two-step incipient impregnation process [ 17 ] . First, the activated carbon was impregnated with the magnesium nitrate solution; then, after drying at 383 K the second impregnation with the platinum solution was achieved. The final magnesium oxide loading of the catalyst was 8 wt.-% as determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The catalysts were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption at 298 K in a volumetric system and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Details about the experimental procedure and the data analysis have been reported elsewhere [ 16] . Before characterization and reaction, the catalysts were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 773 K for 1 h (or 12 h). The n-heptane reaction was carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. A catalyst charge between 50 and 250 mg was used in the experiments, the number of surface platinum atoms in the reactor being the same for each run. The n-hexane was fed into the reactor by bubbling a flow of hydrogen (50 cm3 min-') through a saturator-condenser maintained at 293 K. The HZ/n-C7H16 molar ratio was 23.3. The effect of the HZ/n-CA6 ratio on product selectivity was studied at a constant space velocity by maintaining the total flow at 50 cm3 min-' with helium as a diluent of the hydrogen. The effluents of the reactor were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph provided with a thermal conductivity detector and a 30% DC-200 Chromosorb P-AW column. The major reactions of n-heptane over platinum/ activated carbons include aromatization to toluene and benzene, isomerization to branched and cyclic C7hydrocarbons and hydrogenolysis to form CZC6hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes). Conversion is defined as the amount of nheptane converted to other products based on mole percentage. Selectivities are calculated as the amount of n-heptane converted into each product divided by the total amount of n-heptane converted, and are expressed in mole percent. 3. Results and discussion Table 1 summarizes the results of hydrogen chemisorption onto the carbonsupported platinum catalysts, which are shown as the ratio of the number of chemisorbed hydrogen atoms over the total number of platinum atoms (H/Pt). The mean particle size obtained by TEM measurements on some of the catalysts is also included. These catalysts were selected from a set of catalysts where the dispersion was varied by varying the preparation and pretreatment conditions [ 16 ] . Another catalyst, G, was added to test the effect of the basic function (Mg0) on the activity and selectivity for the n-heptane reaction. As can be seen in Table 1, we have platinum catalysts with dispersions that cover a wide range and which correspond to platinum particle sizes between 21.6 and 1.6 nm [ 16] . Note the good agreement between the average platinum particle sizes estimated by hydrogen chemisorption data and TEM measurements. 274 L RodHguez-Ramos, A.

The dependence of the heptane conversion rate with the time-on-stream over the E catalyst (H/Pt = 0.52) is shown in Fig. 1. The rate falls rapidly over the first 60 min, then decays slowly from 60 to 180 min on-stream. Similar activity-time curves were obtained for the other catalysts. The deactivation of the catalysts calculated by comparison of the activity at 180 min with that obtained at 20 min was found to be nearly the same for all the catalysts. Thus, the activity of the catalysts decreases by about 30% over the first 180 min of reaction whatever the metal dispersion of the catalyst is. This appears to be in agreement with the results recently reported by Larsen and Haller [ 14] for O/L-zeolite catalysts, that deactivation is more sensitive to the acidity of the L-zeolite than to particle size. The performance of the carbon-supported platinum catalysts after 3 h on-stream are compared in Table 2. The turnover frequencies (TOF) at 733 K were calculated as the number of n-heptane molecules reacted per surface platinum atom per second at 15% conversion assuming differential conditions.

Thus, the turnover frequency slightly increases with increasing metal dispersion. Also in Table 2, the platinum crystallite sizes, obtained by TEM before and after reaction, are shown for D and G catalysts. It is observed that the platinum particles do not suffer agglomeration under the reaction conditions. Then, the deactivation of the carbon-supported platinum catalysts must be ascribed to carbon deposition on the metal particles during reaction. This agrees with the results recently reported for Pt/ Si02 and Pt/L-zeolite [ 13 ] , that the loss of platinum active sites occurs by carbon deposits that block platinum atoms and not by sintering under reaction. In order to compare the catalysts better, the turnover frequencies for the various reactions of n-heptane are presented in Fig. 2 as a function of the platinum dispersion. Under the conditions described above, the main reactions of n-heptane were the aromatization to toluene and benzene, the isomerization to branched and cyclic C., hydrocarbons and the hydrogenolysis to C1-C6 products (alkanes and alkenes). 15 --.10 N O u_ ~ 5 8 o 0 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 H/Pt Fig. 2.

From Fig. 2 is observed that turnover rates for n-heptane aromatization and isomerization show no trend with metal dispersion. It seems that these reactions are independent of the metal crystallite size, at least in the range from 1.5 to 21.6 nm. The isomerization of hydrocarbons is usually considered to be a structure-insensitive reaction [ 18] . As for the aromatization reaction, this finding fully agrees with that reported by Dautzenberg and Platteeuw [ 19] for the n-hexane aromatization on monofunctional alumina-supported platinum catalysts. However, a clear trend with increasing metal dispersion can be seen in Fig. 2 for the hydrogenolysis of n-heptane. The turnover frequency for formation of C1-C6 hydrocarbons increases with the metal H/Pt ratio. In a previous study with these carbon-supported platinum catalysts [ 20] a similar correlation was shown between the turnover rate for hydrogenolysis of n-butane and the metal dispersion. In general, hydrogenolysis is known to be a structure-sensitive reaction on metal surfaces requiring specific active centres with suitable geometry and disposition [ 18 ] . On the other hand, from these results can be inferred that the hydrogenolysis reaction is the responsible for the slight increase of turnover frequency for the total nheptane conversion observed in Table 2. The selectivities for the various n-heptane reactions at about 15% conversion are plotted in Fig. 3 for the different catalysts. It is found that selectivities for isomerization and hydrogenolysis change with the metal dispersion whereas that for aromatization remains unchanged. As the metal particle size decreases the isomerization of n-heptane is less favoured than hydrogenolysis. These results suggest that these two latter reactions take place on the same active sites whereas the aromatization requires different sites. The independence of the aromatization, in contrast to the hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, was previously stated for the n-hexane transformation over Pt/ SiOZ [21 ] . As can be observed in Fig. 3, the carbon-supported platinum catalysts have a selectivity to aromatics of about 24%. This value is very close to that recently L Rodrfguez-Ramos, A. Guerrero-Ruiz /Applied Catalysis A: General 119 (1994) 271-278 277 Table 3 Product distribution for n-heptane reactions at different hydrogen/ n-heptane ratios Catalyst H2/n-heptane Selectivity (%)a Hd Is At E 23 62 16 22 11 55 22 23 5 47 28 25 a Selectivity for hydrogenolysis (Hd), isomerization (Is) and aromatization (Ar) reactions. reported for a Pt/carbon catalyst [ 12] having a H/Pt = 0.79 and working at 733 K and 11.2% conversion; yet these authors work at a lower hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon ratio (HZ/C6HIZ = 6) than we did in our experiments. Table 3 shows the selectivities for the various n-heptane reactions obtained by feeding different HZ/ n-heptane ratios over the E catalyst. Decreasing the HZ/n-heptane molar ratio (from 23 to 5) , slightly increases the selectivity for aromatization (from 22 to 25) . However, the selectivity for hydrogenolysis (and in consequence the selectivity for isomerization) is more strongly affected, as could be expected. On the other hand, a lower HZ/n-heptane ratio causes an increase in the degree of deactivation of the catalyst (Alga/A2o from 30 to 57%) over the first 3 h of reaction. This fact must be due to a faster rate of coke accumulation on the metal particles. Finally, to study the influence of the basic function on n-heptane aromatization, a catalyst (G catalyst) doped with 8 wt.-% MgO was prepared. The study of this catalyst by TEM shows a uniform distribution of the platinum and magnesia particles on the support surface, being in a close vicinity each other. From Figs. 2 and 3 can be deduced that the basic function has no effect on the aromatization of nheptane. This result supports the suggestion of Mielczarski et al. [ 12] that the aromatization reaction is monofunctional over nonacidic platinum catalysts. In short, in carbon-supported platinum catalysts neither the metallic dispersion nor the bifunctional catalysis involving basic sites are important for the aromatization of n-heptane. However, the hydrogenolysis of n-heptane is a structuresensitive reaction that is affected by the variation in metal particle size. These results led us to suggest that the exceptional aromatization selectivity of the Pt/KL catalyst might be related with a severe inhibition of the structure-sensitive hydrogenolysis reaction over this catalyst.

        "dc:description": "A series of carbon-supported platinum catalysts with different metallic dispersions (from 0.05 to 0.68) was tested for the n-heptane aromatization reaction. The influence of a basic function (MgO) on the catalytic behaviour was also examined. It is found that, as the metal particle size decreases, the turnover frequency for hydrogenolysis increases, while those for isomerization and aromatization remain unchanged. Moreover, the selectivities for isomerization and hydrogenolysis change with the metal dispersion while that for aromatization remains constant. In addition, no modification in catalytic properties is observed by adding base sites to a Pt/carbon catalyst. These results suggest that aromatization is a structure-insensitive reaction and that it is independent of the other reactions.",
