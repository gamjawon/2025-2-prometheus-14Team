It is shown that when a conjugated aldehyde such as crotonaldehyde is hydrogenated, a high temperature reduction enhances the selectivity of the iridium and ruthenium catalysts in the formation of the unsaturated alcohol, which suggests that decoration of metal particles by titania sub-oxides generates new catalytic sites selective for carbonyl group hydrogenation. However, such behaviour is not observed for the unsaturated ketones. Introduction Hydrogenation of the olefinic moiety in unsaturated carbonyl compounds is readily achieved over most platinum group metal catalysts under mild conditions [ 1 ]. A more challenging problem, which could have also practical applications [2], is that of selective activation of carbonyl groups in a molecule also containing the C=C bond. Moreover, when the carbon-carbon double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl group, hydrogenation of the carbonyl functionality alone appears a difficult task, since almost all metal catalysts routinely give saturated compounds as the main products [3]. Recently, several research groups have reported catalysts capable of reducing selectively certain conjugated aldehydes such as crotonaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (see for example [4-9]). However, to the best of our knowledge no heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst selective for the formation of allylic alcohols from conjugated ketones has been reported so far, while this reduction can be easily achieved in hydrogen transfer conditions using MgO as catalyst [ 10 ]. 0304-5I02O2/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 244 It appears from the literature that different factors such as geometric effects [8], presence of additives [4, 11] or increasing particle size [12] can enhance the selectivity in unsaturated alcohols. The interaction between the metal and the support can also affect the selectivity of a catalyst [3]. Kinetic studies also showed that SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction, i.e. suppression of HZ and CO chemisorption capabilities of supported metals after a high temperature reduction [13]) can effectively change not only catalytic activity but also the reaction pathway, enhancing formation of unsaturated alcohols in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [2, 3] and acrolein [15]. In the present study the influence of high temperature reduction on the catalytic activity and selectivity of metal catalysts of Groups 8 and 9 in the hydrogenation of some unsaturated ketones and crotonaldehyde was investigated. Experimental IrC13 - 3H20, RhC13 - 3H20, RuC13 - 3H20 and H20sC18 were purchased from Metalli Preziosi and used as received. Ti02 (BET surface area 12.8 m2 g-1, pore volume 0.1 ml g-1) was purchased from C. Erba. Catalysts (nominal loading 1.5 wt.%) were prepared by the incipient wetness technique. After impregnation the catalysts were dried at 493 K overnight. Calcination was carried out at 623 K for 3 h. Organic reactants were distilled before use. Catalytic experiments were carried out in a pulse reactor interfaced to a GLC. Typically 20-50 mg of catalyst were reduced for 14 h at 473 K (LTR, Low Temperature Reduction) in a flow of H2 (20 ml min-1), reactor temperature was then lowered and the catalytic activity was measured by injecting 0.1-1.0 Eil of the organic reactant. Blank experiments showed no catalytic activity attributable to the support in these conditions. For the HTR (High Temperature Reduction) experiments, after LTR the catalysts were further reduced at 723 K for 1 h. H2 chemisorption at 298 K was measured on a C.

The amount of chemisorbed H2 was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the adsorption isotherm to zero pressure. 245 Results and discussion BM effects on catalyst activity and cselectivity Hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones and crotonaldehyde was carried out in a pulse reactor in the temperature range 323-373 K. The results are reported in Table 1. The activities and selectivities reported in Table 1 refer to the first pulse over a freshly reduced catalyst, so that initial activities over a virgin metal surface are measured. It appears clear from Table 1 that the effects of HTR treatment on the catalytic activity and selectivity depend on the nature of both the supported metal and the organic reactant. In the same reaction conditions, rhodium and ruthenium catalysts appear to be more active than iridium and osmium ones. Over these catalysts predominantly the C=C bond is reduced after both LTR and HTR, consistent with the fact that Ru and in particular Rh are very active metals for hydrogenation of the C=C bond [16]. Generally speaking, after HTR a decrease in catalytic activity is observed which is more pronounced for a structure-sensitive reaction [ 17 ]. There is some controversy in the literature concerning the hydrogenation of TABLE 1 Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, mesityl oxide and 5-hexen-2-one over Ti02 supported metal catalysts' Reactant Catalyst Conv.

In our reaction conditions, after HTR treatment a decrease in catalytic activity was generally observed. This decrease became more evident on increasing the reduction time. Thus over the osmium catalyst (20 mg, pulse volume 0.3 Al), conversion decreased from 829'o to 34ss'o and 9% after LTR, HTR (1 h, 723 K), and HTR (3 h, 773 k) respectively. In contrast with crotonaldehyde, in the hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones, no enhancement in carbonyl group reduction appeared to be present after HTR. We report here only the results obtained over the iridium catalyst, since similar activities and selectivities were obtained over the other metals investigated. In the hydrogenation of acrolein over Ir/Nb2O5 [20] and Pt/ Nb205 [ 15 ] catalysts, enhancement of selectivity towards carbonyl group reduction after HTR was attributed to the formation of new catalytic sites on the periphery of the metal particles, due to the migration of NbO., islands onto the metal particles. Acrolein is suggested to adsorb via an rl' intermediate with the oxygen atom directed towards the metal-oxide interface; the intermediate is then hydrogenated to give unsaturated alcohol. In the case of conjugated ketones, such a coordination could be prevented by the higher steric hindrance at the carbonyl group. Iridium-phosphine complexes in the homogeneous phase selectively hydrogenate conjugated ketones to unsaturated alcohols when the steric hindrance around the metal center is properly adjusted to prevent coordination of the C=C bond [21]. Origin of enhanced cselectivity It is well known that the SMSI state can be easily reversed by an oxidizing agent. In some cases the products of the reaction itself, such as atomic oxygen and water, can reverse the SMSI state, as for example is the case in the CO/HZ reaction [17]. Particle size and the nature of the metal can however influence both generation [ 17 ] (i.e. degree of suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption capabilities) and stability of the SMSI state [221. It has been shown in the hydrogenation of COZ over Rh/rn02 catalysts, that for a catalyst with a low dispersion, as in our case, the SMSI state is not reversed even after several hours of reaction [23]. Changes in catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde were therefore monitored by irdecting consecutive pulses of the reactants. A typical reaction profile is reported for the iridium catalyst in Fig. 1. As a general trend, the catalysts rapidly deactivate to reach constant activity after a few pulses. In the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde in a flow reactor using a HTR-Pt/rIIOZ catalyst, a rapid decrease in catalytic activity and a drop in crotyl alcohol selectivity was observed, which could be reversed by subsequent HTR [3]. The deactivation reported in Fig. 1 is consistent with the data. reported in [3], however there is a striking difference as far as selectivity of the catalyst is concerned, which suggests that in our case the effects of HTR treatment 247 100 a O dl Rr 47 p 50 O U 100 D V so as h t A B ars L?E 1 2 9 4 6 8 9 Pulse Number Fig. 1.

As is shown in Fig. 1B, over the HTR-Ir/Ti02 catalyst the selectivity in crotyl alcohol is always higher than that observed with the LTR catalyst. Since crotyl alcohol is an intermediate product of the total reduction of crotonaldehyde, dependence of the selectivity on conversion can be expected. A series of experiments was therefore carried out by varying the amount of catalyst and pulse volume. The results obtained over virgin metal surfaces are reported in Fig. 2. As far as the osmium catalyst is concerned, it appears clear that (i) selectivity in crotyl alcohol depends on conversion (lower conversions favour higher selectivities) and (ii) no selectivity enhancement attributable to HTR is observed with this catalyst. Consistently, even after reduction at 773 K for 3 h, the observed selectivities fit the same experimental curve (Fig. 2A). The higher selectivity after HTR which is reported in Table 1 must be attributed to the lower degree of conversion. Osmium is the metal of choice for chemoselective reduction of the carbonyl group [ 1 ]; moreover, Ti02 was reported to enhance formation of unsaturated alcohol [3] and therefore the observed chemoselectivity is not surprising. A quite different picture was observed using Ir/Ti02 and Ru/Ti02 catalysts. After HTR, the selectivity in crotyl alcohol is at least twice that of LTR catalysts over a range of conversions 20-8090 (Fig. 2B and C).

As mentioned above, many factors including particle size [12], residual chloride [24] etc. can indeed influence catalyst selectivity in the hydrogenation of conjugated aldehydes. Since catalysts with low dispersion (see Experimental) are used in this study, particle size effects should not be expected. Some selected experiments were carried out on the iridium catalyst to verify the influence of other factors on the selectivity (Table 2). The presence or absence of residual chloride on the catalyst surface was inferred to be responsible for selectivity in the hydrogenation of conjugated aldehydes. Thus over an RuCl3/Ti02 catalyst, the enhancement of selectivity after HTR was attributed [24] to the removal of Cl- since Ru3(CO),2/Ti02 showed comparable selectivity after LTR. On the other hand, .very recently it was reported that the presence of residual Cl- on a Co/Si02 catalyst enhanced the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol formation in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde [25]. Calcination of the IrCl3/Ti02 catalyst before reduction is expected to result in removal of CI[26]. After HTR, selectivity of a uncalcined catalyst and a calcined one increased from 15 to 48% and from 0 to 58% respectively (Table 2, runs 1 and 2 and )fig. 2B). This suggests that Cl- does not play a significant 249 TABLE 2 Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over iridium catalysts' Run Catalyst Conv. Enol -al -of Others Sel.

Since long reduction times were used for the LTR, most of the Cl- is probably removed during the treatment. This result is also confirmed by experiments carried out with IrCI3/A1203 (Table 2, runs. 3 and 4), which indicate that residual Cl- should not influence the catalyst selectivity. SMSI can be reversed by oxidation and subsequent low temperature reduction [17]. Since the catalyst deactivates when consecutive pulses are irdected (FIg. 1), reactivation of the catalyst was first investigated. Simple thermal desorption (473 K) in flow of HZ was not sufficient to reverse the deactivation (Table 2, run 5). However when the desorption is followed by 250 an oxidation the initial activity is partially regained (Table 2, run 6), which suggests that carbon deposits could form on the metal surface. Iridium is an active hydrogenolysis catalyst [27], moreover, aldehydes are known to decarbonylate easily. Reversibility of the effects of HTR was then checked using the reactivation procedure, which includes the oxidation step in flowing argon (Table 2, run 7). The results obtained strongly support the idea [2, 3, 15, 20] that new catalytic sites due to TiO, decoration of the metal particles are formed after high temperature reduction, which are responsible for the enhancement of selectivity in the formation of unsaturated alcohol. Conclusions The results obtained in this study confirm the important effects of HTR treatment on the selectivity of hydrogenation catalyst. However, the beneficial effects which favour the formation of unsaturated alcohols from unsaturated carbonyl compounds are limited to the case of conjugated aldehydes and strongly depend on the nature of the metal. Thus, in the case of the low dispersion iridium and ruthenium catalysts used in this study, decoration of the metal particles by titania sub-oxides, induced by HTR, produces new stable catalytic sites selective for carbonyl group hydrogenation. On the other hand, over osmium and rhodium catalysts the catalytic activity is merely depressed, while no enhanced selectivity attributable to formation of new catalytic sites is observed.

Valerio 22, 34127 Trieste Italy Gino Picasso Escobar International Centre for Science and High Technology, Padriciano, 99, 34100 Trieste Italy Alessandro Trovarelli Istituto di Chimica, Universita' di Udine, Via Cotonificio 108, 33100 Udine Italy Chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds over Groups 8 and 9 titania-supported metal catalysts was investigated in a pulse reactor. It is shown that when a conjugated aldehyde such as crotonaldehyde is hydrogenated, a high temperature reduction enhances the selectivity of the iridium and ruthenium catalysts in the formation of the unsaturated alcohol, which suggests that decoration of metal particles by titania sub-oxides generates new catalytic sites selective for carbonyl group hydrogenation. However, such behaviour is not observed for the unsaturated ketones. References 1 P.N. Rylander Catalytic Hydrogenation over Platinum Metals 1971 Academic Press New York 2 M.A. Vannice J. Mol.
