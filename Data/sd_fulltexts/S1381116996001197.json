The palladium catalyst is dissolved in the aqueous phase by using water-soluble phosphine ligands. The turnover numbers (TON) are higher than 1500 and turnover frequencies (TOF) of 135 h- 1 are reached. The length of the induction period observed is in inverse order to the phosphine-palladium ratio. The reaction rate is strongly dependent on the temperature and the initial substrate concentration. Continuous addition of substrates is increasing the life time of the catalyst. The proposed active species is generated via chloride- and hydroxy-bridged palladium dimers.

Introduction Phenylacetic acid and substituted derivatives are valuable intermediates in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and fragrances. The current industrial production of phenylacetic acids starts with the corresponding benzyl chloride which is converted by a chloride/cyanide exchange to benzyl cyanide. Subsequent hydrolysis with sulfuric acid yields the phenylacetic acids (Eq. (1)). This two-step process has considerable drawbacks such as formation of a stoichiometric amount of salt, e.g., sodium chloride (exchange reaction) and ammo- Corresponding author.

Kohlpainmer, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 The transition metal-catalyzed carbonylation of benzyl halides to yield phenylacetic acids was extensively studied in the past [ 1,16]. Twophase systems are applied with the catalyst and the substrate being dissolved in the organic phase and an alkaline aqueous solution as the second phase. The phenylacetic acid formed during the reaction is dissolved in the waterphase as the corresponding sodium salt (Fig. 1). The excess of base is necessary for two reasons: The acid H X (X = Cl, Br, I) formed during the carbonylation reaction has to be neutralized to maintain a high reaction rate. Secondly, the catalyst-product separation is achieved only if the phenylacetic acid is deprotonated and dissolved in the aqueous phase. The crude product is obtained after phase separation, acidification of the water phase, and extraction of the phenylacetic acid with a nonmiscible organic solvent. Additional salt is formed as the alkaline aqueous solution is neutralized by the acid. The amount of salt is directly related to the excess of base which is used in the carbonylation step. The final product is isolated by further purification steps from the organic solution. Despite significant disadvan- tages such as high catalyst loading (5-10 mol% of Co2(CO)g), indispensable addition of phase transfer reagents, significant metal loss with the product stream, and limitation to the expensive benzyl bromides as starting materials, this process has been reported to be practiced by Montedison [ 1,16]. The use of water-soluble catalysts [2] for carbonylation of organic halides was scarcely studied in the past [3-7]. In Refs. [3] and [4], ruthenium-ED TA (EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetate) and cobalt-TPPTS (TPPTS = triphenylphosphine trisulfonate trisodium salt, 1) are described, respectively. The application of palladium with TPPMS (TPPMS = triphenylphosphine monosulfonate monosodium salt) is described in Ref. [5]. In the case of EDTA and TPPMS modified metal complexes, the product/catalyst separation is insufficient. Loss of metal with the product stream and low product quality due to metal impurities result. The cobalt-TPPTS complex performs only at 20 bar CO pressure and has to be used at concentrations > 8 mol% in the double carbonylation of phenylethyl bromide to benzylpyruvic acid.

Substrate and catalyst are dissolved in the organic phase and an aqueous alkaline solution serves as the second phase (left). During carbonylation acid H X is formed, the substrate converted to the product, which is dissolved in the alkaline aqueous phase (middle). The latter is separated and extracted with an organic solvent. Acid is added to transfer the product as its free acid form into the organic phase (right). C.W Kohlpaintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 reported the carbonylation of bromobenzene with palladium-TPPTS complexes [6]. The present report describes a new carbonylation process for substituted benzyl chlorides based on a water-soluble palladium catalyst which circumvents most of the aforementioned disadvantages of the current carbonylation process [7]. 2. Results 2.1. Description of the process The reaction is performed in a two-phase system (see Fig. 2, Eq. (3)). The catalyst consisting of a palladium salt and a water-soluble phosphine is dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution. The organic phase, typically toluene or xylene, contains the substrate. During the reaction the phenylacetic acid molecule is formed with concomitant consumption of carbon monoxide and HCl production. The caustic solution neutralizes the acid formed (formation of NaCl) and the phenylacetic acid is dissolved in the aqueous phase as the corresponding sodium salt. In contrast to the conventional process (catalyst dissolved in the organic phase), the carbonylation can be performed in an acidic media approaching pH 2 without affecting the Table 1 Carbonylation of various benzyl chlorides (batchwise procedure) 261 ,k, cl CO H,0 ~i OH O cal x Fig. 2.

At this pH more than 99% of the phenylacetic acid sodium salt is protonated (pKa = 4) and dissolved in the organic phase. After phase separation, the product is isolated from the organic solution. Recrystallization yields the product in > 99% purity. 2.2. Catalytic results Table 1 summarizes the results obtained for various benzyl chlorides (batchwise process). In all cases a catalyst formed in situ from NO., or Pd(OAc)z and TPPTS was used. The nature of the palladium source (PdC12 vs. Pd(OAc)z) did not influence the catalytic results obtained (not shown in the table).

Kohlpaintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 Conversions are generally > 96% with high selectivities to the acid. By-products formed are benzyl alcohols (by hydrolysis), dibenzyl ethers (Williams' ether synthesis) and benzyl phenylacetic acid esters. Minor amounts of the substrate are hydrogenolyzed (water-gas shift reaction) to form substituted toluenes. The reaction performed better at higher CO pressure for benzyl chloride only. For all other substrates rates and selectivities dropped at higher CO pressure. For a more general approach, various transition metals were studied in the carbonylation of 4-fluorobenzyl chloride (4-FBC). The results are summarized in Table 2. As mentioned earlier, cobalt carbonyl has to be applied in > 5 mol% quantities to achieve a significant conversion (entries 1, 2). By increasing the CO pressure, conversion becomes worse (entries 3-6). Even Pd/C showed a tenfold higher activity in presence of TPPTS (entry 7). Under identical reaction conditions, a comparative experiment with TPP (triphenylphosphine) yielded phenylacetic acid in < 5%. The dependence of the catalytic results on the properties of the phosphine (water-soluble vs. organic-soluble) suggests that palladium is leaching from the support. An active palladium complex might be Table 2 Carbonylation of benzyl chlorides with various catalysts a formed whose activity is higher in water (Pd/TPPTS) than in the organic medium (Pd/TPP). The activation of a heterogeneous catalyst by phosphines was observed previously by El Ali et al. [8]. Pdsources like Pd(PPh3)4 afford the same results as Pd` species (entry 8). The induction period observed in previous runs (see below) was not shortened. Palladium colloids prepared according to B6nnemann et al. [9] showed no activity at all, with or without addition of TPPTS (entries 9, 10). PdC12 without added TPPTS is inactive as well (entry 11). Thus, the presence of phosphines is necessary to perform the reaction. Other transition metals like nickel or rhodium are inactive under the applied reaction conditions. 2.3. Palladium/ BINAS catalyst The sulfonated diphosphine NAPHOS [ 10], abbreviated as BINAS (2, Ar = m-C6H4S03Na), has shown superior activity in the two-phase hydroformylation of propene [ 11 ] and reduction of aromatic nitro compounds [ 12].

Conversion and selectivity are slightly lower. After the third recovery, the catalyst is deactivated effecting almost no conversion. By addition of a fresh equivalent of catalyst solution, high conversion and selectivity are restored (entry 4). However, the catalyst tends to deactivate faster after the first recovery.

In the present report t;Rd. is defined as the time passing until 1 molo of CO relative to the substrate is consumed. After t;, the catalyst soon reaches its highest activity. A typical CO uptake curve with time is shown in Fig. 3. During the induction period, a small amount of carbon monoxide is consumed and the reaction mixture slowly turns dark. Precipitation of palladium black (powder or particles) is not observed. 2.5. Phosphine / Pd ratio At constant temperature (70), the initial activity as determined by the CO-uptake in the 264 C.W. Kohlpaintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 first 2 h is negative order with respect to the TPPTS/Pd ratio (Fig. 4). The initial reaction rate decreases with increasing phosphine/Pd ratios. However, the total activity is lower for small phosphine/Pd ratios as the catalyst deactivates previous to complete conversion. As a compromise between length of induction period and total conversion, the optimized phosphine/Pd ratio is 5:1. Ratios of 10:1 or 20:1 do not further improve the overall performance of the catalyst. 2.6. Temperature The length of the induction period is strongly dependent on the temperature. For a standard run, tied is reduced from about 6 h at 70 to about 10 to 15 min at 90. However, at higher temperatures the catalyst deactivates considerably faster. Use of a temperature profile during the reaction, e.g., to start with 80-90 and to reduce the temperature to about 70 after ti, is advantageous for expanding the life time of the catalyst and for improving the catalytic results. 2.7.

After 2 h of reaction, considerable differences are observed. At low substrate concentrations (CO), especially for Co = 0.8 mol/1, the turnover number (TON) is significantly higher. For the experiments shown in Fig. 5, the quantity of the palladium catalyst in the aqueous phase is kept constant at 0.2 mmol. After 2 h of reaction ( t = 2 h), the pH is adjusted to 7.0 and NaOH (60 mmol) and substrate (40 mmol) are added to determine the maximum achievable TON. Base and substrate are added every time after 80% of the substrate is converted (based on CO-uptake). The original volume of o-xylene remains unchanged. The initial substrate concentration has a significant impact on the overall performance of the catalyst. Starting with the lowest Co, the highest TON are reached and vice versa. 2.8. Continuous operation From the previous batch experiments, one can conclude that continuous addition of base and substrate is beneficial to the catalyst's performance. To determine the maximum achievable TON, 1.5 eq. of base and 1 eq. of substrate were added after 80% conversion of the initial C.W Kohlpaintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 substrate (based on CO-uptake). A maximum TON of 1560 was reached under optimized conditions. In using a temperature profile as described previously, the average turnover frequency (TOF, [h-' ]) was improved to 135. 3. Discussion 3.1. Induction period (ti) Based on the generally accepted mechanism for palladium-catalyzed carbonylation reactions, the catalytic cycle starts with a coordinatively unsaturated Pdspecies. In this respect, Grushin and Alper showed that under carbonylation conditions in alkaline solutions and in the presence of a phosphine, a Pd'I precursor is reduced to Pdby OH-. The phosphine ligand is oxidized at the same time and a highly reactive unsaturated Pdspecies is generated (Eq. (4)) [13]. Carbon monoxide or hydrogen (generated by water-gas shift reaction) can be excluded as the reducing agents. Even after hours of sparging CO through a vigorously stirred boiling benzene solution of PdC12(PPh3)2 and water, no precipitation of palladium was observed [13].

However, with TPPTS as a ligand, the precipitation of palladium black is strongly dependent on the pH of the solution. Sparging CO through an aqueous solution of PdCl,,/TPPTS precipitation of palladium black is much slower at basic (pH > 11) and acidic (pH < 3) conditions as in the range of 3 < pH < 11. Thus, depending on the pH, carbon monoxide and/or hydroxide may effect the reduction. 3.2. Catalytic cycle The coordinatively unsaturated Pdspecies is believed to undergo oxidative addition by the substrate and forms the chloro bridged dimer 3 (Fig. 6). At basic conditions, an equilibrium of 3 with an hydroxy bridged dimer 4 is probable. In the case of water-insoluble complexes, Alper showed that 3 reacts faster with CO than the hydroxy bridged dimer 4 [13]. After coordination and insertion, carbon monoxide is incorporated and the benzoyl palladium dimer 5 is formed. Under experimental conditions, 5 reacts to the hydroxy dimer 6 which reductively eliminates the phenylacetic acid. The unsaturated Pdspecies [LPd] is re-generated and the catalytic cycle continues. 3.3. Deactivation We assume that deactivation of the catalyst proceeds via formation of inactive palladium agglomerates. Initially, these agglomerates stabilized by TPPTS might be catalytically active. Metal clusters of this kind have been synthesized by Schmid and co-workers [ 14]. The constantly colorless organic phase during the reaction indicates that the dark colored agglomerates are dissolved by the water-soluble ligand and (4) remain in the aqueous solution. The aggregation proceeds up to a particle size where the dissolu tion of the agglomerate cannot be maintained by the ligand and palladium black starts to precipi tate. These metal particles, in contrast to the 266 CW. Koh1paintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 116 (1997) 259-267 stabilized agglomerates, are not catalytically active. 4. Conclusion One may conclude from these experiments that base, carbon monoxide and substrate are essential to start and maintain the catalytic cycle. If one of these components is not available in sufficiently high concentrations the agglomeration of palladium atoms accelerates thus terminating the catalysis. The high activity of the palladium-TPPTS catalyst relative to PdClz/TPP is founded in its presence in the water-phase. The Cl- and OH- present in the aqueous solution stabilize the active intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The concentrations of Cl- and OH- in the organic phase are by far lower. Due to this lack of stabilization, waterinsoluble catalysts are less reactive and conversions and yields are inferior compared with their water-soluble counterparts.

Wherever these hydroxy complexes play a role in a catalytic cycle, watersoluble catalysts should show significant improvements, not only because of product/catalyst separation but also for the sometimes higher magnitudes of activity. So far, the reactivity of Pd/BINAS catalysts at acidic conditions in not understood and further investigations are underway to explain this phenomena. 5. Experimental 5.1. General procedure Under inert gas atmosphere (Ar), the reagents are charged to a 250 ml-four-neck flask equipped with thermometer, reflux condenser and gas sparger. The gas sparger is connected to a gas burette. The inert gas is removed by evacuating and refilling the system with carbon monoxide.

C.W Kohlpaintner, M. Beller/Journal of Molecular Catalvsis A: Chemical I l6 (1997) 259-267 The reaction mixture is heated to the desired temperature (70-90). The CO uptake is measured with help of the gas burette. The reactions under carbon monoxide pressure are performed in a 200 ml Hastelloy-C autoclave with magnetic stirrer. At the end of the reaction, the pH is measured. If necessary, dilute HCl is added to adjust the pH to 1-2. The organic solution is examined by GC for preliminary results. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase extracted twice with a small amount of organic solvent. The organic phases are combined. The solvent is evaporated and the residue re-crystallized from an iso-hexane/o-xylene (1 / 1 vol./vol.) solvent mixture. The isolated solid material contains the product in > 99% purity. The individual compounds are identified by GC and NMR analysis. The mother liquor contains 10-15 wt% phenylacetic acid. The data on TON, TOF, and yields are based on the isolated products.

Beller b a Hoechst Celanese, 1901 Clarkwood Road, Corpus Christi, TX 78469, USA b Technical University Munich, Lichtenbergstrasse 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany ∗ Corresponding author. Palladium-catalyzed carbonylation of substituted benzyl chlorides in a two-phase system at atmospheric carbon monoxide pressure generates the corresponding phenylacetic acids in 80–94% yield. The palladium catalyst is dissolved in the aqueous phase by using water-soluble phosphine ligands. The turnover numbers (TON) are higher than 1500 and turnover frequencies (TOF) of 135 h−1 are reached. The length of the induction period observed is in inverse order to the phosphine-palladium ratio. The reaction rate is strongly dependent on the temperature and the initial substrate concentration. Continuous addition of substrates is increasing the life time of the catalyst. The proposed active species is generated via chloride- and hydroxy-bridged palladium dimers.
