Introduction The catalytic activity and selectivity of metal oxides depend on several factors Various authors relate the catalytic activity to the formation enthalpy of the metal oxide as a measure for the strength of the metal-oxygen bond [ 1-3 ] However, in most cases the bulk average thermochemical properties, like the heat of formation, cannot charactense the bond strength of surface oxygen in particular bonds Therefore, in other papers the activity is related to the properties like the rate of the isotopic oxygen exchange [ 4 ] , the amount of excess oxygen [ 5 ] , the heat of desorption of oxygen from the surface [ 6,7,24,25 ] , the calculated metal oxygen bond strength [ 8 ] or calculated metal-oxygen bond energy [ 9,10] According to Sachtler et al [ 11 ] , the catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of benzaldehyde increases when the metal-oxygen bond strength decreases, whereby successive removal of a second and third oxygen atom from around a certain cation would * Corresponding author 0304-5102/94/$07 00 1994 Elsevier Science B V All rights reserved SSDI0304-5102(94)00121-9 306 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 305-316 require considerably more energy than removal of the first oxygen atom and this factor dictates the ratio selective/deep oxidation The catalytic activity can also be related to other factors, like undersaturation of the surface atoms [ 7,12,13 ] , the acidity of the surface [ 14], the kind of crystallographic plane that is preferentially exposed (this seems to be particularly important for the selectivity of the reaction) [ 7,9,10,12 ] or the structure of the surface (stenc hindrance, heterogeneity) Of course, many of these factors are influenced by the mode of preparation of the corresponding metal oxide and the surrounding atmosphere The relationship between the above mentioned properties of transition metal oxides and their catalytic activities have been extensively studied m (selective) oxidation reactions, thus m reactions where the oxide surface is partially reduced by one component of the reaction, whereafter the oxygen vacancies are replenished by di-oxygen However, the second step can also be used to advantage, for example for a selective reduction reaction, like the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to mtrosobenzene [ 15 ] Not much research has been done yet on the relationship between transition metal oxides and their properties on one side and the behaviour m selective reduction reactions on the other side The oxide Mn304 is a good catalyst for the selective reduction (see Eq 1) of nitrobenzene [ 15 ] , ON02 + H2- ONO + H20 (l' ) ON02 + CO - ONO + C02 (1\") 27ON02 -j 25ON0+ 12C02 +5H20 (1\"') \"autoreduction\" but it appeared from exploratory experiments that other 3d transition metal oxides also showed good activity [ 16 ] The differences m the activities of the 3d transition metal oxides m the selective reduction of nitrobenzene were much smaller than those m, for example, the oxidation of hydrogen, see Fig 1 [ 17,18 ] (note the difference with the figure m [ 18 ] , because m that paper, the catalytic activity for the selective reduction of nitrobenzene has been expressed m \"mol\") The smaller activity differences are probably due to a different kind of reoxidation step m the case of the oxidation reaction two oxygens should enter the lattice, whereas m the case of the selective reduction reaction, only one oxygen should enter the lattice at once since selective reduction of nitrobenzene to mtrosobenzene removes only one oxygen from the molecule The main side reaction, in reactions with an external reducer, is the aniline production e g according to ON02 + 3H2 - ONH2 + 2H2 O (2 ) upon which reaction two oxygen atoms have to be removed. In this paper, the relationship between the catalytic activity and selectivity of the 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal oxides and different properties of these oxides, in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene will be investigated in more detail, taking A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 305-316 307 _4 reVUctlon or nftrnwntene -6 oxlohtfon of H2 -8 o -10 ,r '\" \" -12 1`1 I -16 4\\02 4'0 (T'~9 \"s 010 Cp\"e 0'o 0 1tA Fig 1 A comparison of the catalytic activities in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene and in the oxidation of hydrogen, for different 3d transition metal oxides [ 17,18] into account structure differences, the heat of formation of individual oxides, experimentally determined metal-oxygen bond energies on the surface and empirically established reducibility of the different oxides 2. Experimental 2 I Preparation of the catalysts The oxides described in this paper are oxides with the formulae AB204 (splnel), M203, M03, M205 and M02 The following oxides were commercial samples T102 (Ventron, Karlsruhe), Zr02 (Merck, Darmstadt), Nb205 (Fluka AG, Buchs SG), Ta205 (Fluka AG, Buchs SG) and Hf02 V205 was made by calcination of NH4V03 at 673 K for 20 h [ 19] V203 was made by reduction of V205 at 673 K M003 was prepared by calcination of (NH4)6Mo7024 at 873 K for 17 h W03 was synthesised by precipitation of Na2W04 ZH20 with 15 M HN03 Mn304, ZnMn204, Co304, ZnC0204, ZnCr204 and Fe203 were prepared from hydroxides, obtained by precipitation of the corresponding metal nitrates at pH = 9 The hydroxides were decomposed in air at 400 K Co304 and ZnC0204 were moreover calcined at 873 K, ZnCr204 was calcined at 1073 K [ 20] and Fe203 was calcined at 600 K Mn203 was made by oxidation of Mn304 at 573 K for 1 5 h in a flow of pure oxygen Fe304 was prepared by reduction of Fe203 at 573 K for 1 5 h in a flow of pure hydrogen [ 21 ] The following oxides were synthesised by the decomposition of the corresponding metal nitrates in air Cr203 (673 K, 4 h), Ni0 (673 K, 20 h), Cu0 (600 K, 20 h), Zn0 (700 K, 20 h), ZnFe204 (873 K, 20 h, then 1273 K, 20 h, then 1473 K, 20 h) and La203 (1123 K, 17 h) [ 22 ] 308 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 305-316 2 2 Catalyst characterisation All catalysts were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) Surface area measurements were performed on a Quantasorb apparatus from Quantachrome The simplest one point method was used Thermogravimetnc experiments were done on a Setaram thermobalance A flow of 5% Hz/Ar with a flow rate of 100 ml/mm was used The temperature was increased from 300 K to 1100 K with 5 K/ mm 2 3 Catalytic data measurements and evaluation Catalytic measurements were carried out m an open flow system with fixed bed reactor Products were analysed with a GC. The reaction conditions were, standard temperature of the reaction was 573 K, carrier gas was helium, pressure of nitrobenzene was 70 Pa (total pressure was 1 bar) and the flow rate was 25 ml/mm The reaction was performed without an extra reducer (autoredox) or with an extra reducer (CO) Analysis was performed on-line with a GC, using an automatically driven sampling valve For more details see [ 15 ] 3. Results 3 1 Characterisation of the catalysts XRD X-ray powder diffraction confirmed that the desired oxides were synthesised, without any other compound detectable by XRD Most catalysts did not change during the reaction with nitrobenzene, except for V205, which was partially reduced to V409 after the reaction (the colour of the catalyst changed from orange-brown to black), V203, which was oxidised to V204 and Mn203, which was partially reduced to Mn304 [ 15 ] 3 2 Catalytic activity in the nztrosobenzene formation The catalytic activity of the metal oxides for the reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene under standard conditions is expressed as the rate of mtrosobenzene formation m 10-' mol/m2 s (this is per unit surface area) The selectivity has been arbitrarily defined as the concentration of nitrosobenzene divided by the sum of mtrosobenzene and aniline The activation energy has been formally determined by the formula In r= In A - Ea lRT, where r is the rate of reaction at low conversion, A is a constant, Ea is the apparent activation energy, R is the universal gas constant and T is the temperature of the reaction m K For most oxides, the activity has been measured m two ways (1) without an external reducer (autoredox) and (2) with an external reducer (CO) A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 305-316 10 e 4 2 0 autoredox E]m t h CO J2 ~20'D ~20hC.~2o ~~\",C~` ~20 ~o\"~O~` o20'F on~0~` y0 GAO 'L~'O 309 Fig 2 The catalytic activity of the 3d transition metal oxides (m 10-' mol/m2 s) m the selective reduction of nitrobenzene In the next sections, the catalytic activities of the different metal oxides mil be related to i their place m the Periodic Table, 11 the bulk structure of the oxide (spmel, corundum etc ), iii. the reducibility of the metal oxides ( a measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength, mainly a bulk property), iv the heat of formation (also a measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength m the bulk of the oxide) per oxygen atom, v the activation energy of oxygen desorption ( a measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength on the oxide surface) 3 3 The catalytic activity of transition metal oxides Figs 2 and 3 show the catalytic activity of the 3d metal oxides and of various O and Sd metal oxides as a function of nuclear charge ( the place m the periodic table). The catalytic activities of Mn304 and Vz05 are slightly higher than those of the other 3d transition metal oxides, whereas Zn0 does not show any measurable activity (Fig 2) There are no pronounced differences m the selectivities (between 85 and 100%) and activation energies (all about 100 kJ/mol) of the various 3d transition metal oxides Addition of CO to the feed does not really change the catalytic activity of the different oxides However, m most cases the activation energy is lower with an external reducer (CO) (for T102, the activation energy decreases only slightly) The side production of aniline (two oxygen atoms have to be removed) increases in the presence of carbon monoxide strongly m the case 310 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 305-316 4

transition metal oxides are slightly lower (except W03) than those of the 3d transition metal oxides (see Fig 3) The selectivities as defined above, are within this group of oxides in all cases 100% Again, addition of CO to the feed does not change the activity, except of the activity of M003, which increases strongly in the presence of CO For these oxides, the selectivity does not change either (no aniline formation can be detected) Table 1 shows that there is no clear tendency in the catalytic activities within the oxides of one group of the periodic table There is a decrease in the activity from V205 to Nb205 to Ta205 (Group Vb), but this is not true for the other two groups investigated here (the Groups IVb and VIb) 3 4 The bulk structure of the different transition metal oxides To obtain information on the possible role of the structures, the catalytic activities of four mixed spinets of uniform structure were measured Comparison of the Table 1 The catalytic activity

(spinel) (Fig 2) leads us to the conclusion that in this case there is no pronounced effect on the activity due to structural differences It can also be concluded that the activities of the chromium, iron and cobalt oxides are similar, whereas the activity of manganese oxides seems to be always higher 3 5 The reducibility of various 3d transition metal oxides The temperature of reduction of an oxide, determined by thermogravimetry, is, amongst others, a measure for the metal-oxygen bond strength The reduction temperatures of some 3d transition metal oxides (our samples) in the reaction with hydrogen, determined with thennogravimetry, are shown in Table 2 (the reduction temperature is in this case the temperature where the reduction of the oxide starts) No correlation with the catalytic activity of these metal oxides can be found 3 6 The heat of formation The formation enthalpy is also a certain measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength in the bulk of the oxide Some authors expect also a close relation of this value to the metal-oxygen bond strength on the surface [2] In Fig 5 the activities of the 3d, 4d and 5d metal oxides are displayed as a function of the heat of formation (in kJ/mol) normalised per one oxygen atom of the stoichiometnc metal oxide [ 23 ] A certain correlation can perhaps be seen the catalytic activity is low when the heat of formation is very low (less than 200 kJ/mol) or very high (more than 312 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 305-316 Table 2 The reduction temperatures of different 3d transition metal oxides, measured by

catalytic activity increases strongly between -4H=300 kJ/ mol and 360 kJ/mol It seems as if a volcano-shape correlation has been found Correlations of this shape have been reported in many papers on catalytic oxidations 3 7 The metal-oxygen bond strength The heat of formation has been used in numerous papers as a measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength It has been shown above that there is

activation energy of desorption (kJ/mol) (from [7,25] ) of nltrosobenzene However, the activity of catalytic processes should be better related to the bond strengths of the surface atoms, having an incomplete coordination Below we will discuss the correlation of the catalytic activity m the selective reduction of nitrobenzene with experimentally determined metal-oxygen bond energies [7,24,25] Boreskov et al [24] estimated the bond energy of oxygen by measurements of the equilibrium oxygen pressures In this way, they could estimate the desorption heat of oxygen m the initial state of the oxide, but also m a later phase, when some oxygen was removed It was found that for the oxides Co304, N10 and CuO, the initial adsorption heat has a rather low value (67-79 kJ/mol), whereas the analogous values are much higher for V205 and T10z Most oxides showed an increase of the desorption heat when oxygen was pumped out of the system Comparison of the initial heats of desorption with the rate of the oxidation of CH4 or H2, and with the rate of the di-oxygen isotopic exchange reaction, shows that there is a linear correlation the activation energy increases with a decreasing heat of desorption of oxygen, thus with a decreasing metal-oxygen bond strength (see Fig 6 m ref [ 24 ] ) Different authors [ 7,25 ] determined the activation energy of oxygen desorption of various oxides by means of thermal desorption spectroscopy Every oxide shows a distinct number of oxygen desorption peaks Table 3 shows the heat of desorption [ 24 ] and the activation energy of oxygen desorption [ 7,25 ] of various 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal oxides 314 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 93 (1994) 305-316 Table 3 The heat and the activation energy of oxygen desorption of various

to oxygen that desorbed below 450 K It can be seen, that the activation energies of oxygen desorption follow approximately, with a proper choice of the states, the order in heats of desorption, determined by Boreskov et al [ 24 ] The experimental data on the activation energies of oxygen desorption [ 7,25 ] are used for our reaction as the measure of the metal-oxygen bond strength on the surface The lowest activation energy of each oxide has been chosen, except the oxygen that desorbs below 450 K Probably, this oxygen does not take part in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene (reaction temperature is 573 K) In any case, they are not good correlation results 4. Discussion It can be concluded from the above described experiments, that nearly all 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal oxides are active in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene Experiments with other metal oxides, like Sn02, B1203, PbO, Ce02 and A1203 [ 26,27 ] , show that not only transition metal oxides are active, but that the activity is obviously due to the fact that a metal ion can change its valency during the reaction A certain M\" + /M\" + 1 ratio in the surface layers of the oxide is necessary, as can be seen with Mn203 that is partially reduced by the running reaction to Mn304, while MnO is partially oxidised to Mn304 [ 15 ] In a similar manner, V203 when used was oxidised to V204 and V205 was partially reduced to V409 Addition of CO as an external reducer renders in most cases a strong decrease in the selectivity and in the apparent activation energy Without CO, oxygen vacancies are created by oxidation of the phenyl ring of nitrobenzene When CO is added to the feed, A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 305-316 315 these vacancies are created mainly by CO When aniline is being simultaneously produced by the autoreduction, or with CO as the reducer, then the hydrogenation proceeds by the surface OH groups, which are supplied by hydrogen from the phenyl ring fragments [ 29 ] The whole picture of the rate as a function of temperature indicates a creation by CO of a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies at low temperatures, i e , under conditions that the reduction of the surface by the phenyl group is slow 'Some oxides do not show a decrease in the selectivity, when CO is added to the feed This is due to the high-temperature synthesis of the oxides there are no (or only a few) hydroxyl groups on the surface of these oxides, groups which are needed for aniline formation [ 29 ] Some correlation can be found between the heat of formation of the oxides and their activity in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene This volcano-shaped correlation would mean that there is an optimum metal-oxygen bond strength Moreover, the bond strength in the bulk of the oxides should in this case represent the bond strength at the surface However, another explanation for the higher activity of some oxides (Mn304, Mn203, Vz05 and W03) is also possible the spinel Mn304 is tetragonally distorted, thus the distance of two of the six metal-oxygen bonds, when manganese is in octahedral position, is larger This means that some of the bonds in Mn304 are weaker than the average metal-oxygen bond XRD results showed that Mn203 is by the reaction partially converted into Mn304, thus this catalyst has probably also more reactive oxygen The surface of VZ05 has been converted to V409, which can have more of reactive oxygen than other oxides For example, literature data [ 28 ] show that the (001) plane of V6013 would expose about twice as many V=O bonds on V6013 than the (010) plane on V205 Some of the V=O bonds on V6013 are more undersaturated than those on V205 and can be expected to be more active in oxidation and ammoxidation reactions The fact that the catalyst W03 is more active than the other 4d and 5d oxides can also be due to the fact that there is more reactive oxygen at the surface of this oxide, because this catalyst has been synthesised at lower temperatures than the other ones The poor correlation between the activity of the various oxides and the activation energy of oxygen desorption also shows that the activity in the selective reduction reaction does not only depend on the metal-oxygen bond strength (at least not on these experimentally determined bond strengths), but also on factors as mentioned above It seems probable that the metal-oxygen bond strengths on the surface of the oxides depend on the preparation method, as mentioned above It seems that synthesis of oxides at high temperatures removes most of the reactive oxygen 5. Conclusion Most transition metal oxides, which can change valency, are active in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene The activity is rather sensitive to the preparation method and to individual metal-oxygen bonds on the surface of the 316 A Maltha et al /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 93 (1994) 305-316 oxides There is no clear correlation with the place of the metal element in the Periodic Table, structure and reducibility of the oxide, heat of oxide formation and activation energy of oxygen desorption Acknowledgements The authors thank R C M de Groot for performing the TG measurements The financial support by NWO (SON) and by the Leiden University is gratefully acknowledged References [ I ] G K Boreskov, Proc 3rd Int Congr Catal , Vol I (1965 ), 163 [2] 1 Komuro, H Yamamoto and T Kwan, Bull Chem Soc Jpn, 36 (1963) 1532 [ 3 ] Y Morooka and A Ozaki, J Catal , 5 (1966) 116 [4] V D Sokolovskii, G N Mitrofanova and L A Sazonov, Kinet Katal, 11 (1970) 804 [ 5 ] T Uchijiama, M Takahashi and Y Yoneda, Bull Chem Soc Jpn , 40 (1967) 2767 [6] Y P Arnaud, Appl Surf Sci, 62 (1992) 21 [7] L Gonzalez-Cruz, J -P Joly and J -E Germain, J Clum Phys, 75 (1978) 324 [ 8 ] K Klier, J Catal , 8 (1967) 14 [ 9 ] J Ziolkowski, J Catal , 80 (1983) 263 [ 10] J Ziolkowski and T Wiltowski, J Catal , 90 (1984) 329 [ 1 I ] W M H Sachtler, G J H Dorgelo, J Fahrenfort and R J H Voorhoeve, Proc 4th Int Congr Catal Moscow (1968) p 454 [ 12] Y P Arnaud, Appl Surf Sci , 62 (1992) 37 [ 131 Y P Arnaud, Appl Surf Sci, 62 (1992) 47 [ 14 ] T Tanaka, H Kumagai, H Hatton, M Kudo and S Masegawa, J Catal, 127 (1991) 221 [ 15 ] A Maltha, T L F Favre, H F Kist, A P Zuur and V Ponec, J Catal in press [ 16 ] A Maltha, S C van Wenneskerken, T L F Favre, P A J M Angevaare, E J Grootendorst, C A Koutstaal, A P Zuur and V Ponec, Catal Today, 10 (1991) 387 [ 17 ] V V Popovsku and G K Boreskov, Prob Kinet Catal , Nauk SSSR, 10 (1960) 67 [ 18 ] A Maltha and V Ponec, Catal Today, 17 (1993) 419 [ 19] R J H Clark, Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry, Vol 3, Pergamon Press, 1973, p 513 [20] L Passenni, Gazz Chim Ital , 60 (1930) 389 [ 21 ] F Glaser, Z Anorg Chem, 36 (1903) 1 [22] V B Glushkova and A G Boganov, Bull Acad Sci USSR Div Chem Sci , (1965) 1101 [23] K Tanaka and K Tamaru, J Catal , 2 (1963) 366 [24] G K Boreskov, V V Popovsku and V A Sazonov, Proc 4th Int Congr Catal Moscow (1968) 439 [ 25 ] B Halpern and J E Germain, J Catal , 37 (1975) 44 [ 26 ] A Maltha, T L F Favre, B Brunet, C J C Gaudin and V Ponec, in press [ 27 ] A Maltha, H F Kist, B Brunet, J Ziolkowski, H Onishi, Y Iwasawa and V Ponec, in press [ 28 ] A Andersson, J Solid State Chem, 42 (1982) 263 [29] E J Grootendorst and V Ponec, Stud Surf Sci Catal , 78 (1993) 483 X244 94001219 0304-5102(94)00121-9 10.1016/0304-5102(94)00121-9 Transition metal oxides as catalysts for the selective reduction of nitrobenzene A. Maltha S.C. van Wermeskerken B. Brunet V. Ponec ∗ Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, P.O. Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands * Corresponding author. The activity of various 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal oxides in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene has been investigated. An attempt has been made to find a correlation between these activities and several properties of the oxides investigated, such as their place in the Periodic Table, structure, reducibility, heat of formation and surface metal—oxygen bond strength. A weak volcano-shape correlation can be seen with the heat of formation and the surface metal—oxygen bond strength.
