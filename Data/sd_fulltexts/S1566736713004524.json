Tel.: +86 731 85258232. Graphene/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids were synthesized by one-step PAA-assisted hydrothermal method with a low-temperature treatment. Their morphology, structure and photocatalytic property were investigated accordingly. The SEM and TEM results showed that the nanohybrids composed of TiO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles with the size of about 10nm were uniformly covered on the graphene sheets. Furthermore, the resultant samples presented excellent photocatalytic activity for RhB and recycle property, in which 95% RhB was degraded within 10min and a good activity was maintained in the seven recycling tests, besides the hybrids also possess good activity in visible light. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to efficient transfer of the photogenerated electrons from the CB of semiconductor nanoparticles to graphene and the homogeneity of nanoparticles. Graphical abstract Keywords Bi2O3/TiO2 lamination Graphene Nanohybrids Photocatalytic property 1 Introduction Rapid development of photocatalysts applied in environmental treatment and water splitting, TiO2 has been recognized as one of the most promising photocatalysts because of its stability, superior photoactivity, nontoxicity and other unique properties. Unfortunately, these deficiencies of TiO2 such as low utilization for visible light due to a broad band gap about 3.2eV and high recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs limit TiO2 to wide application. Given this, many methods were applied such as ion-doped method, noble metal deposition, dye sensitization, semiconductor composite and using electron conduction carriers [1–4]. Notably, Bi2O3 semiconductor, one of the potential visible-light photocatalysts for a direct band gap about 2.8eV [5], has gradually been used to improve the photocatalytic property of TiO2. Combining Bi2O3 with TiO2 can not only restrain the recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, but also make the optic absorption of TiO2 broad and the stability of Bi2O3 improved, simultaneously [6,7]. For example, the reported complexes consisted of TiO2 and Bi2O3 fabricated by J.K. Zhou et al. showed excellent photocatalytic performance and a significant red-shift of light absorption edge [8]. However, the ordered growth and aggregation of nanoparticles are still the problems that are exigent to be solved. Recently graphene as a photocatalyst carrier has been extensively focused for a large specific surface area and excellent electron transport properties which can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles and hinder the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes [9,10]. In available researches, graphene has significantly improved the photocatalytic ability of TiO2 [11], CdS [12], ZnO [13] and Bi2O3 [14], etc. Although many progresses have been obtained in GR/TiO2 composites, conglomeration often happened in the GR creating a poor activation. Furthermore, it is difficult to dominate the uniformity and the quality of nanoparticles on the GR sheets. Hence, more efforts such as controlling the homogeneity or quality of TiO2 nanoparticles on the GR sheets, improving the absorption for visible light and increasing optical quantum efficiency of GR/TiO2 composite to enhance the performance of GR/TiO2 composites for practical applications are necessary. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a facile and versatile approach to obtain GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids with high photocatalytic property. Polyacrylic acid (PAA), known as emulsifiers and thickening agents for aqueous solutions and dispersions of both natural and synthetic latexes, smoothing agents for synthetic fibers, sorbents and ion exchangers, aqueous quenching media, flocculants and plastics in adhesive, cosmetics, coating and agriculture chemicals, respectively [15], was used to activate the interaction of GR and nanoparticles and to control the size and uniformity of nanoparticles on the graphene sheets. Furthermore, the main factors in the preparation and photocatalytic property of resultant nanohybrids were studied in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids Graphene oxide (GO) solution was firstly manufactured to a concentration of 0.8g/L by the modified Hummer method [16]. In a typical procedure, GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids were performed as follows: a mixture of PAA (20% in water), GO solution and distilled water was stirred with volume ratio (V1) of 1: 5.5: 16.4, the details shown in 3.3, and then another transparent blend of nitric acid solution dissolved with different mole ratios (M1, from 0 to 1.5) of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and TNBT was added in to sonicate for 30min. It's important that another solution of 10mL ammonia (20% in distilled water) was instilled in the former with very slow change of pH value. After that the whole was transferred to refrigerator under 4°C for 2h, then the precursor was obtained after kept in the Teflon-lined stainless steel reaction autoclave at 120°C for 18h. Finally, the resultant precipitate was filtrated and washed repeatedly with deionized water and dried at 65°C. 2.2 Characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was operated on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses and the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were conducted on a JEM-3010 transmission electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using Philips PW 1710 diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation. Rhodamine B (RhB) was used as a model dye to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 hybrids. In a typical experiment, 50mg catalyst was dispersed in 300mL of 2×10−5 mol·L−1 RhB aqueous solution. The above reaction mixtures were conducted at room temperature under a high-pressure mercury lamp (100W and 500W with wave length 365nm) which positioned over a stirrer, while a Xe-lamp with a quartz filter was used in the visible light photocatalytic test. In the procedure, the RhB aqueous solution was magnetically stirred throughout the photocatalytic experiment to ensure the full suspension of particles. The experiments were conducted with 6mL sample aliquots extracted every 10min and subsequently centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10min. Using TU-2550 spectrophotometer at 554nm to measure the absorbance of the supernatant, the degradation ratio of RhB was calculated with (C/C0 − t), where C0 is the initial concentration and C is the concentration of RhB in solution at different times (t). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD analysis The X-ray diffraction patterns of GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids with different Bi/Ti mole ratios (M1) are shown in Fig. 1 . From the XRD curve of pure TiO2, we can observe that there are eight main peaks at 2θ=25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 53.9°, 62.7°, 68.8°, 70.3° and 75.0°, which are attributed to (101), (004), (200), (105), (213), (204), (116) and (215) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCDPS 21-1272), respectively. Comparison with three curves, the diffraction peak intensity of TiO2 is gradually reduced while the diffraction peak intensity of Bi2O3 becomes stronger with increasing Bi content. When M1 is 0.5, the planes (201), (002), and (220) of Bi2O3 are observed at 2θ=27.8°, 31.5° and 32.7°, respectively. This result indicates that Bi2O3 nanocrystalline dissolved out after bismuth nitrate imported in to the right extent and a major complicated change was found in XRD pattern was mainly derived from the complexity of polymorphism bismuth oxide and the high proportion of multi-component system. 3.2 Electronic microscope analysis The SEM image of GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 composites was presented in Fig. 2a. We can see tiny nanoparticles homogeneously covered on the surface of sheets material, which supported bigger holes and benefited to the absorption of light energy, thus is possible to obtain a better absorbability and photodegradation for pollution. To further observe the morphology of nanoparticles and sheets, TEM was conducted and the results were displayed in Fig. 2b. It is evident that the nanoparticles with the size of about 10nm are well dispersed on the surface of graphene. Moreover, we can also find that crystal stripes of TiO2 and Bi2O3 from the HRTEM image and that TiO2 laminated on Bi2O3 which overlaid on graphene nanoplates as shown in Fig. 2c. In addition, the peaks of C, O, Ti, Bi and Cu elements are detected from the EDX graph (Fig. 2d) where the peak of Cu element is descended from the copper grid. These results further testify that the resultant nanohybrids are composed of graphene, TiO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles. 3.3 Photocatalytic study To verify the functions of main factors in synthesis process, we conducted series of photocatalytic tests and the results were shown in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that with 0.7mL PAA auxiliary, 4mL GO solution and 1.5 Bi/Ti (molar ratio) added during the procedure, the ultimate samples have proven to a very high photocatalytic activity for RhB, in which the photodegradation value of RhB approached 90% within 20min and completely after 30min below 100W irradiation (displayed in Fig. 3c). Notably, the appropriate proportion addition of Bi iron can significantly enhanced the absorbability for RhB which should cause by the special structure of GR/Bi2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites. The effects of other factors on photodegradation of RhB such as sample dosages and light intensity are also studied once optimum conditions were established as exhibited in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Analytically, different usages didn't make much impact on photodegradation for RhB. The result of 50mg dosage in previous series was very close to that of appropriate 150mg consumption from Fig. 4a. We also find that the photocatalytic ability will lessen with the augment of sample owing to the shading of excessive sample or graphene. Convenient for the further explorations, 150mg dosages were taken to explore the effect of light intensity on the photocatalytic activity of sample and photocatalytic recycle for RhB. From the Fig. 4b, we can see that the photocatalytic activity under 500W light radiation is as almost twice times as that of 100W light radiation according to the data at 10min, responsible to the truth that light energy can drive the semiconductor and make organics to break down. At this point, the counterpart photos (Fig. 4c) of RhB in process, in accordance with the result of Fig. 4b, showed the apparent color change from pink to transparent after light on which indicated that the RhB in solution can be degraded completely within 30min. The fastness and stability of TiO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles attached with graphene were discussed and measured by recycle tests conducted with seven times in our study. From the result in Fig. 4d, it is evident that the resultant samples own good repeatability and RhB can be degraded completely within 40min in every test, and that 80% to 90% of RhB can be decomposed in 10min after stirred in the dark for 30min, which means it has an excellent stability. When the recycle was conducted for four times or more, attenuation in 10min appeared owing to the loss of sample and residual of RhB in the former test. In addition, the photoactivity for RhB of the GR/Bi2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation was also investigated and a good activity was discovered of origin sample, obviously higher than the blank irradiation without sample, but a better one was excavated which was collected from the previous photocatalytic result in UV irradiation, and also a stronger absorbability for RhB was found. The results suggested that the UV excitation can improve the photocatalytic activity of samples. 3.4 Mechanism analysis Based on the above experimental results, a possible growth mechanism of assembling TiO2–Bi2O3 on the GR sheet is proposed and the complete scheme is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The graphene was firstly exfoliated from graphite modified with some oxygen functional groups such as COOH, OH and O by Hummer method, leading to negative charges (process 1 in Fig. 5). Secondly the PAA was introduced in to disperse GR owing to its negative electrification as well and to flat GR sheets due to their long chain structure (process 2). Then positive bismuth ions (III) and titanium ions (IV) dissociated out under pH=1 attached rapidly with electronic functional groups on graphene and PAA (process 3). During aqueous ammonia slowly instilled, the precipitates of bismuth hydroxyl were firstly spawning uniformly on the graphene and PAA, titanium hydroxyl was successively covered on the former with the fine adjustment of pH (process 4). In a hydrothermal process, the nanoparticles separated from PAA, which further crystallized and contacted tightly with graphene (process 6). Moreover, the nanoparticles were limited to a superfine size of 10nm as ascribed to the homogeneous nucleation points at the oxygen functional groups on graphene and PAA and the particular hypothermia process (process 5). Furthermore, the large specific surface area of graphene and the chain structure of PAA restrained the diffusion and recombination of nanoparticles. The as-prepared nanohybrids showed an excellent performance mainly depending on the nanoparticles loaded uniformly on graphene. As a catalyst carrier, graphene has a large specific surface area which can prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles and raise specific surface area of complex, thus improving the adsorption capacity for organic. When the TiO2 and Bi2O3 are photoexcited, the electrons of TiO2 were easily transferred to Bi2O3 for the little positive position of conduct band on Bi2O3 [7,10] and also photogenerated electrons can both be trapped and transferred by graphene for its super electronic storage and conduction capacity. In consequence, the electrons and holes separated speedily. Therefore, the photocatalytic property of TiO2 improved significantly. Beyond that, the property of photocatalysts in visible light was improved after UV light irradiation because UV light can provide energy for the growth of GR/Bi2O3–TiO2 crystals. Meanwhile, graphene oxide was reduced to re-GR that the electron conduction of hybrids was improved and the photocatalytic activity was further enhanced by the electron excitated from this energy [17] and the organic in hybrids was further removed by UV light irradiation, thus a porous structure to strong absorption for pollutions was formed. 4 Conclusions The GR/TiO2–Bi2O3 nanohybrids prepared by a direct hydrothermal method with pre-hypothermia treatment have been proven to have a very high photocatalytic activity for RhB. The PAA succeeded in preventing the aggregation of graphene sheets and controlling TiO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles with the size of about 10nm. Moreover, the one-step hydrothermal process can make nanoparticles load uniformly and tightly on the graphene sheets and the UV pre-excited step can be an available method to enhance activity of photocatalysts. This method supports an access to solve the problem of graphene on composition and expand the utilization of graphene on fields of solar battery, photocatalysis, and water cleaning, etc. Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51302021 and 50972043), Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 09JJ3095 and 14JJ2077), Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department (No.09A001), National (Ministry of Land and Resources) Public Welfare Scientific Research (No.201011031), the Construct Program of the Key Discipline in Hunan Province, and the Aid Program for Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province.

Their morphology, structure and photocatalytic property were investigated accordingly. The SEM and TEM results showed that the nanohybrids composed of TiO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles with the size of about 10nm were uniformly covered on the graphene sheets. Furthermore, the resultant samples presented excellent photocatalytic activity for RhB and recycle property, in which 95% RhB was degraded within 10min and a good activity was maintained in the seven recycling tests, besides the hybrids also possess good activity in visible light. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity is attributed to efficient transfer of the photogenerated electrons from the CB of semiconductor nanoparticles to graphene and the homogeneity of nanoparticles.",
