All of these ligands afforded mononuclear manganese(III) complexes in good yields. In two cases, the pentacoordination of the manganese ion could be confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The complexes catalyzed the epoxidation of olefins with a variety of terminal oxidants, but most importantly, with dilute (1%) aqueous hydrogen peroxide and without any added co-ligands. With 1,2-dihydronaphthalene as substrate and 10 mol% of catalyst, enantiomeric excesses up to 66% were achieved. This value is the highest so far reported for an asymmetric epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene, using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and a salen-type complex as catalyst. Control experiments using a tetradentate chelate lacking the axial imidazole donor showed that the pentacoordination of the manganese ion is crucial for the peroxidase activity. Furthermore, it was shown that the enantiomeric excess of the product epoxide(s) is basically constant during the whole reaction time. Therefore, the high enantioselectivity of the oxygen transfer process must be ascribed solely to an efficient enantioface selection by the chiral catalysts, and not to secondary transformations of the product epoxide(s).

As a part of our studies on biomimetic catalysts for selective oxyfunctionalizations [7,8], we addressed the question whether hydrogen peroxide could be employed as the terminal oxidant [6]. Its advantages are obvious: It is a cheap and mild reagent, with only water being formed as waste product [9]. The main challenge associated with this oxidant, however, is favoring the heterolytic O-O bond cleavage, with concomitant formation of the reactive metal-oxene species, over destructive radical pathways [10]. In many per- 2 The application of hydrogen peroxide in manganese-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidations has been described for salon-type catalysts in the presence of large amounts of external co-ligands in Ref.

This proximal donor is believed to facilitate O-O heterolysis. Not surprisingly, imidazole and derivatives thereof have proven beneficial as co-ligands for manganese-complex co iMn--, O~ A salon-type manganese chelates N -~ N~ I~N O~Mn~O B peroxidase model based on pentadentate dihydrosalen manganese chelates Fig. I.

Berkessel et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 321-342 catalyzed epoxidations [ 14], especially with hydrogen peroxide as the source of oxygen [6,15,16]. For the efficient utilization of this oxidant in the enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins, it appeared desirable to combine the features of a peroxidase-like coordination sphere and a (chiral) manganese(III) salen complex (A, Fig. 1). In such an arrangement, a fifth, axial donor, preferably an imidazole group, should be covalently attached 3 to a salen-type complex (B, Fig. 1). Herein we describe the synthesis of pentadentate ligands of the dihydrosalen [7,8,17,18] type, the conversion of these ligands to manganese(III) complexes of the type B (Scheme 1), X-ray crystal structures of two representative chelates and the catalytic performance of these novel peroxidase models. 2. Results 2.1. Synthesis of the ligands and manganese complexes Our three-step sequence used for the synthesis of the pentadentate dihydrosalen ligands is depicted in Scheme 1. The secondary amines 1 served as starting materials. They were prepared in racemic form by reductive amination of the corresponding ketones (see Ref. [19] for the preparation of rac-la-d, and the experimental section for the preparation of rac-le, f). Very good yields were generally obtained when methyl- or ethylamine were used. Switching to iso-propylamine, however, gave only 28% of the secondary amine rac-If. As expected, only marginal yields of the amination product were found when amines of even higher steric demand, like, e.g., tert-butylamine, were em- j For examples of tetradentate dihydrosalen complexes, see Ref. [17]; for an achiral Mn-porphyrin with a pendant imidazole group, see Ref. [18] 323 ployed. Furthermore, the S-configurated amine la was used in enantiomerically pure form (see Ref. [ 19] for the separation of the enantiomers of rac-la). The reductive alkylation of the secondary amines rac-la-a using 2-(Nphthalimino)acetaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride afforded the N-protected derivatives of ethylene diamine rac-2a-a in good yields. The analogous alkylation of the enantiomerically pure amine la gave 2a in 83% yield. Clearly, this alkylation step is again very sensitive to the steric bulk present at the amine nitrogen atom. As shown in Scheme 1, the alkylation of the N-ethyl amine rac-le afforded the alkylation product rac-2e in only 28% yield. When the N-iso-propyl amine rac-if was used, only trace amounts of the desired alkylation product were obtained under a variety of reaction conditions.

The enantiomeri- 324 A. Berkessel et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 321-342 cally pure ligand 4a was prepared from 2a in just the same way. Finally, the ligands rac-4a-e and 4a were reacted with manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate in methanol in the presence of air and sodium tetraphenyl borate, affording the dark brown manganese(III) complexes rac-5a-e in 55-63% yield as microcrystalline powders (Scheme 1). The enantiomerically pure complex 5a was obtained in 63% yield from the Schiff's base 4a. Besides 5a, the enantiomerically pure manganese(III) chelates 5h and 5i were also synthesized: In the case of 5h, the corresponding Schiff's base 4h was first isolated from the reaction of the diamine 3a with 3-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde (78%). It was then subjected to the metallation conditions described above, affording the complex 5h in 92% yield. In the case of 5i, the diamine 3a was condensed with salicylaldehyde and the resulting Schiff's base was reacted in situ with manganese(II) chloride as described above. The chelate Si was obtained in 44% yield, again as a brown, microcrystalline powder. For comparison, the tetradentate dihydrosalen complex rac-5g, lacking the axial imidazole donor, was prepared, too. Its synthesis closely paralleled that of the pentadentate manganese chelates discussed so far: In the first step, or- tho-hydroxyacetophenone was reductively aminated with methyl amine, affording the secondary am ine ( RS)-2-[1(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (rac-1g, not shown) in 92% yield. The subsequent N-alkylation, hydrazinolysis and condensation with 3,5-di-tertbutylsalicylaldehyde as described above gave the products rac-2g (78%), rac-3g (48%), and rac-4g (quant.) (structures not shown). Finally, our metallation protocol (vide supra) converted the ligand rac-4g to the dark brown manganese(III) chelate rac-5g in 54% yield. 2.2. X-Ray crystal structures of the manganese(111) dihydrosalen complexes rac-5a and rac-5e Single crystals suitable for X-ray structural analyses could be obtained by slow cooling of hot, saturated solutions of the chelates rac-5a, e in ethanol. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. As could be expected, the crystal structures of the N-methyl (rac-5a, Fig. 2) and of the N-ethyl (rac-5e, Fig. 3) complex are very similar. Most important, however, is the finding that both complexes show the desired coordination mode: The metal ion is coordinated equatorially by the oxygen (phenolate) and nitrogen N3 N2 N1 Mn 01 02 Fig. 2.

Furthermore, the fifth imidazole donor occupies an axial position. The sixth coordination site is vacant and may thus be expected to bind and activate a hydrogen peroxide molecule, just as in heme peroxidases. As could be expected, the dihydrosalen ligand is not planar. Both the tetrahedral amine nitrogen atom 325 and the tetrahedral carbon atom carrying the (2-imidazolyl)methyl side-chain induce significant distortion. The planes of the two benzene rings of rac-5a, a intersect at an angle of 45and 27 respectively. Overall, the manganese chelates 5 have two centers of chirality, namely the secondary carbon atom carrying the (2-imidazolyl)methyl side-chain, and the neighboring amine nitrogen atom. When coordinated to the manganese ion, the latter tertiary amine does not invert any more and forms a stable center of chirality. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the (2-imidazolyl)methyl side-chain and the alkyl substituent on the amine nitrogen atom adopt a `transoid' orientation. It appears reasonable to assume that this type of arrangement is conserved in the other complexes ( rac-Sb-d, g, h, i). Since the substituent at the amine nitrogen atom is pointing `downward', i.e., towards the face of the complex where the oxygenation of a substrate is expected to take place, significant asymmetric induction may be anticipated.

Asymmetric epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the enantiomerically pure manganese chelates 5a, h, i As expected, the manganese chelates 5a, h, i showed catalytic activity in the epoxidation of olefins with hydrogen peroxide. The results for the epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6, 6,8-dimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene 7 and styrene are summarized in Table 1. As it turned out, hydrogen peroxide could either be used in homogeneous solution using acetonitrile as solvent, or in a two-phase system. In the latter case, both the olefin and the catalyst were dissolved in dichloromethane, and this solution was then layered with aqueous hydrogen peroxide, at the temperatures and concentrations stated in Table 1. Typically, 10 eq. of the oxidant were used, and 10 mol% of the catalyst (relative to the olefin). In the case of the epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6, using the enantiomerically pure complex 5a (Table 1, entries 1-6), the best results were achieved under two phase conditions: Using 1%-hydrogen peroxide and dichloromethane at 0, the (1 R, 2 S)-epoxide 8 was obtained in high yield (72%) and enantiomeric excess (64%, Table 1, entry 6). This is the best result achieved so far in the asymmetric epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6 with hydrogen peroxide. When the substrate olefin was changed to 6,8-dimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene 7, a similar ee was achieved (63%, Table 1, entry, 9), but at significantly lower yield.

As it turned out, the urea clathrate of hydrogen perox ide (Table 2, entry 1) or so-called sodium `per carbonate' (Table 2, entry 2) could be employed as a suspension in dichloromethane, too. The enantiomeric excesses observed were generally comparable to those obtained in the two-phase system (48% and 53%, respectively). However, the chemical yields were quite reasonable. As shown in Table 2, entries 3-5, 1,2-dihydronaph- 2 thalene 6 could also be epoxidized using a suspension of iodosylbenzene, a two-phase sys tem with sodium hypochlorite, or meta-chloro- perbenzoic acid in homogeneous solution. In the latter case, both yield and ee's were unsatisfac tory, whereas both hypochlorite and iodosylben zene gave chemical yields almost as good as hydrogen peroxide, but at lower ee's. Interest ingly, the epoxidation of trans-stilbene (Table 2, entry 6) could be achieved only with iodosyl benzene as terminal oxidant. 327 2.3.3. Further variations on the catalyst structure: Epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6 catalyzed by the manganese chelates rac-5b-e and rac-5g In the manganese chelate 5a, the `left' benzene ring is substituted by two tert-butyl groups, whereas the `right' benzene does not carry any further substituents. In the catalyst rac-Se, an additional methyl group is positioned ortho to the `right' phenolic oxygen atom (Scheme 1). In rac-5d, a methoxy group occupies the para position relative to the `right' phenolic oxygen atom. The manganese complex rac-5b is derived from rac-5a in that the imidazole NH is exchanged for an N-methyl group. Finally, the chelate rac-Se is related to the parent system rac-5a such that the methyl group at the metalcoordinating amine nitrogen atom is exchanged for an ethyl group (Scheme 1). Finally, in the complex rac-5g, the imidazole moiety is omitted. The catalytic performance of these derivatives of the parent system rac-5a was explored under two-phase conditions, using 1 %-hydrogen peroxide as terminal oxidant and 1,2-dihydro- Table 3 Epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6 with 1% hydrogen peroxide in a two-phase system, catalyzed by the manganese chelates rac-5b-a and rac-5g Entry Catalyst Reaction time \" (h) Olefin Epoxide consumed (%) formed b'` rac-5b rac-5c rac-5d rac-5e 1 rac-5g e 4 2.5 2.5 quant. 96 69 95 d 53 82 (86) 58 (84) 41 (43) 0 All reactions were carried out at 0. b Yields determined by capillary GC (heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl-3O-pentyl)-cyclodextrin column), employing 1,2-dibromobenzene as internal standard.

The results are summarized in Table 3: The ortho-methylated catalyst rac-5c indeed showed a higher efficiency than the parent system rac-5a: The epoxide rac-8 was formed in 82% yield (Table 3, entry 2). All other alterations of the structure resulted in a lowering of the epoxide yield. Most importantly, the tetradentate manganese complex rac5g showed no catalytic activity at all, even in the presence of a large excess of 2-methylimidazole (up to 20 eq., relative to the complex rac-5g). 2.3.4.

When the concentrations of the starting material 6, the product epoxide 8/ent-8 and the ratio of 8/ent-8 were followed by gas chromatography, the time profile shown in Fig. 4 was obtained.

Discussion For the sake of clarity the results presented in this paper shall briefly be summarized again: (a) The synthetic sequence depicted in Scheme 1 allows for the preparation of a wide variety of novel pentadentate dihydrosalen manganese(III) complexes. Depending on whether the starting secondary amines 1 are used in racemic or enantiomerically pure form, the chelates 5 are obtained enantiomerically pure or as racemates. In principle, many other metal ions can be complexes with the ligands 4. (b) The pentadentate manganese(III) chelates 5 act as peroxidase models. They efficiently epoxidize olefins using dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide as terminal oxidant. In enantiomerically pure form, the chiral catalysts 5 induce high enantiomeric excesses in the product epoxides. Oxidants other than hydrogen peroxide can be used as well. (c) The pentacoordination of the manganese(III) ion is a prerequisite for peroxidase activity: Omitting the axial imidazole donor eliminates the catalytic activity. (d) The enantiomeric excess of the product epoxide changes only very little in the course of the reaction. Therefore, a secondary stereospeci%c transformation of the primary epoxidation product appears not to take place. 3.1. Pentadentate manganese(111) complexes of the dihydrosalen type as peroxidase models and as new epoxidation catalysts In view of the above results, it appears that our initial concept of using pentadentate manganese(III) chelates as peroxidase models (Fig. 1) actually afforded a new class of biomimetic oxidation catalysts. As in heme-peroxidases, it may be assumed that the axial ligand facilitates the O-O bond heterolysis of hydrogen peroxide coordinated to the `opposite' axial site at the A. Berkessel et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 321-342 manganese(III) ion [11-13]. The substrate spectrum of the catalysts 5 appears to be similar to that of the manganese(III) salen catalysts described by Jacobsen and co-workers [3,4] and Katsuki [5]: cis- 1,2-disubstituted, conjugated olefins, like e.g. 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6 are epoxidized best, whereas trans-olefins or terminal alkenes like 1-octene give at best poor yields of epoxide. In this context, it is interesting to note that our catalyst 5a did epoxidize transstilbene (Table 2, entry 6), but only with iodosylbenzene as terminal oxidant, and not with any other. It has been pointed out before [20] that the mechanistic pathway for metal-catalyzed oxygen transfer from iodosylbenzene may be different from other oxygen donors: In the former case, an adduct of the catalyst with intact iodosylbenzene may be the active, oxidizing entity, as opposed to the M=O `oxene species' usually postulated [5]. 3.2. On the mechanism of asymmetric induction It was recently found that the high enantioselectivity of the epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6 with Jacobsen's catalysts is in part due to a subsequent, stereospecific hydroxylation of the minor enantiomer of the initially formed epoxide mixture [21]. In other words, the enantiomeric excess of the product epoxide is increased by a subsequent kinetic resolution. As an experimental indicator, the ee of the product increases as the reaction proceeds [21]. In our case, the ee of the product epoxide remains basically constant (Fig. 4), and there is no indication for a secondary process. Consequently, the enantioselectivities observed must occur exclusively at the epoxidation stage. In fact, inspection of space filling models revealed that the enantioselectivity observed can consistently be explained by nonbonding interactions between the approaching substrate olefin and the non-planar catalyst: In the case of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene 6, the approach of the (3Re)-face of the prochiral olefin 6 to the oxygen atom of an intermediate Mn=O species is strongly dis- 329 favored 4. Model studies of this type also indicate that the introduction of substituents on the `right' benzene ring of the catalyst 5a (Fig. 2) should further direct the approach of the olefin and thus increase the face selectivity of the oxygen transfer. 3.3. Stability of the catalysts As with other oxidation catalysts, the major weakness of our catalytic system is its limited stability. In fact, the epoxide yields stated in this article reflect the kinetic competition between oxygen transfer to a substrate and oxidative degradation of the catalyst. Experimentally, the brown solutions of the manganese(III) catalysts 5 bleach as the reaction proceeds. Once they are colorless, the catalytic activity is lost. At first glance, the imidazole NH of the catalyst may appear as an excellent target for the induction of oxidative decay. However, this seems not be the case, since the N-methylated derivative rac-5b does not show increased stability compared to the parent system rac-5a (Table 3, entry 1). It was already shown by Jacobsen [4] that the catalyst stability is increased when the positions ortho and para to the phenolic oxygen atoms are blocked. Most likely, substituents at these positions prevent oxidative phenol coupling reactions. Furthermore, sterically demanding substituents at these positions increase the enantioselectivity of the oxygen transfer reactions. In line with this argumentation, we found that the ortho-methylated complex rac-5c (Scheme 1) gives indeed higher epoxidation yields (Table 3, entry 2). As may have been expected, the electron rich methoxylated catalyst rac-5d is degraded even faster than the parent system rac-5a (Table 3, entry 3). Exchanging the N-methyl group of the catalyst rac-5a (Fig. 2) for an 4 Assuming a coordination state of the manganese ion as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, with the oxene-oxygen atom bonded trans to the imidazole nitrogen, and a perpendicular attack [3,5,4] of this intermediate Mn=O species on the C=C double bond. 330 A. Berkessel et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 113 (1996) 321-342 N-ethyl group in rac-5e (Fig. 3) did not significantly alter the stability of the catalyst (Table 3, entry 4). Thus, an intramolecular attack of an intermediate Mn=O oxene species on the N-alkyl group apparently does not constitute the major degradative pathway. Taken together, the above results indicate that a substitution of both the ortho and the para position (relative to the phenolic oxygen atom) of the `right' benzene ring in 5a with bulky alkyl substituents should provide higher stability towards oxidative degradation. In summary, we have shown that pentacoordinate manganese(III) chelates of the dihydrosalen type show peroxidase activity and that they may be used as catalysts for the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins with hydrogen peroxide as terminal oxidant. Their synthetic value is presently limited by their relatively complex synthesis. We are presently aiming at (a) a significant simplification of the synthesis, and simultaneously at (b) increasing the stability of this promising new class of oxidation catalysts. 4.

General procedure for epoxidations using 1 %-hydrogen peroxide under two phase conditions, catalyzed by the manganese chelates rac5a-e,g and 5a,h,i A 10 ml flask was charged at room temperature with a solution of the olefin (40.0 p,mol), 1,2-dibromobenzene [9.40 mg, 40.0 p,mol (as internal standard)] and the manganese catalyst (4.00 p,mol, 10 mol%) in 1.5 ml of dichloromethane. Water (1.5 ml) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously. 30%-Hydrogen peroxide (45.0 mg, 400 p,mol, 10 eq.) was then injected by means of a syringe. The course of the reaction was monitored by GC or HPLC. For each olefin, the identity and the yield of the oxidation product was verified by isolation. In the case of 1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene rac-8, the isolation was done as follows: The organic phase was filtered through Celite. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was extracted with n-pentane. The extract was flash-chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with n-pentane/ethyl ether 40:1. 4.4.2. General procedure for epoxidations catalyzed by the manganese chelate Sa, using oxidants other than 1 %-hydrogen peroxide A 10 ml flask was charged at room temperature with a solution of the olefin (40.0 p,mol), 1,2-dibromobenzene [9.40 mg, 40.0 wmol (as internal standard)] and the manganese chelate 5a (3.45 mg, 4.00 p,mol, 10 mol%) in 1.5 ml of dichloromethane. With vigorous stirring, the oxidant (400 Rmol, 10 eq.) was added at room temperature. The course of reaction was monitored by GC or HPLC. For each olefin, the identity and the yield of the oxidation product was verified by isolation.

Fax: +49-6221-544205 A series of seven chiral pentadentate dihydrosalen ligands, carrying an imidazole group as a fifth, axial donor was synthesized in racemic and enantiomerically pure form. All of these ligands afforded mononuclear manganese(III) complexes in good yields. In two cases, the pentacoordination of the manganese ion could be confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The complexes catalyzed the epoxidation of olefins with a variety of terminal oxidants, but most importantly, with dilute (1%) aqueous hydrogen peroxide and without any added co-ligands. With 1,2-dihydronaphthalene as substrate and 10 mol% of catalyst, enantiomeric excesses up to 66% were achieved. This value is the highest so far reported for an asymmetric epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene, using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and a salen-type complex as catalyst. Control experiments using a tetradentate chelate lacking the axial imidazole donor showed that the pentacoordination of the manganese ion is crucial for the peroxidase activity. Furthermore, it was shown that the enantiomeric excess of the product epoxide(s) is basically constant during the whole reaction time. Therefore, the high enantioselectivity of the oxygen transfer process must be ascribed solely to an efficient enantioface selection by the chiral catalysts, and not to secondary transformations of the product epoxide(s).
