Graphical abstract Generating atomic-scale data for catalysis simulations is often not the primary bottleneck in accurately predicting catalytic processes. Instead, the reliability of these predictions is highly sensitive to the assumptions underlying the modeling approach. In this work, we demonstrate how modeling assumptions for the coupling reaction between surface-adsorbed CO and O influence the predicted optimal composition of high-entropy alloys. Catalytically joining carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms is crucial for various environmental and industrial applications. However, the reaction environments for this process vary significantly across different applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how reaction environments and associated modeling assumptions influence the predictions of optimal disordered alloy catalysts for CO-O coupling. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising several hundred *CO, *OH, and *O simulated adsorption energies on atomically disordered face-centered cubic (111) surfaces composed of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru. This dataset is provided alongside this publication to support further machine learning-based searches for optimal CO-O coupling catalysts within this composition space for any CO-O coupling application. We illustrate the impact of different modeling assumptions on the identification of CO-O coupling catalysts through two key examples: electrochemical methanol oxidation and CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cells. Keywords Carbon monoxide oxidation Electrocatalysis High-entropy alloys Methanol oxidation Data availability nano.ku.dk/english/research/theoretical-electrocatalysis/katladb/c-o-coupling-on-hea 1 Introduction The successful coupling of carbon monoxide (CO) and surface oxygen species (*OH and *O) is crucial for the oxidation of next-generation net-zero carbon fuels. This process is vital in the electrocatalytic oxidation in fuel cells, such as those based on methanol [1] and formic acid [2]. In these reactions, surface-adsorbed CO (*CO) is virtually unavoidable and poisons the often-used Pt catalyst. This issue can be mitigated by incorporating neighboring Ru atoms, which provide oxygen surface species to expedite the oxidation of Pt-adsorbed *CO [3–5]. CO-O coupling is also essential for the exhaust treatment of hydrocarbon combustion engines in heavy-duty land vehicles and maritime vessels, where battery technology cannot meet performance requirements, and carbon-based fuels will continue to be utilized in the future [6]. Oxidation of CO emissions is relevant for fuels based on methanol [7], gasoline [8], or diesel [9]. In natural gas combustion engines, CO emission is less of a concern [7,10]. Commercial catalysts for CO oxidation in exhaust treatment are based on Pd and Pt and rely on an optimal O2 concentration to enable concurrent CO oxidation and NOx reduction [8,11]. Another application of CO-O coupling is in hydrogen fuel cells, where CO is a contaminant in the hydrogen feedstock. Even trace amounts of CO can detrimentally impact the anode in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. This necessitates efficient CO conversion, either by removing CO in a pretreatment of the reformate gas or by making the fuel cell catalyst tolerant to higher CO concentrations [12–15]. The water–gas shift reaction (WGSR) (Eq. (1) also involves adding an oxygen atom to CO to form CO2. The WGSR is used industrially to produce hydrogen from syngas derived from fossil fuels for ammonia or methanol production or to adjust the CO:H2 ratio for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction [16,17]. Hydrogen production from syngas derived from biomass and landfill waste could also be relevant in the future [18]. A widely accepted mechanism for the WGSR is the redox mechanism, where a surface oxygen atom (re)generated by H2O is abstracted by CO (Eqs. (2)–(3)) [19,20]. (1) CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) (2) H2O(g) + * → H2(g) + *O (3) CO(g) + *O → CO2(g) + * Industrially, Cu is the preferred catalyst for the WGSR, operating at relatively low temperatures below 250 °C [21]. Platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) are the most active monometallic catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of small organic molecules. Consequently, many investigations have focused on Pt and Pd-based materials [22–24]. In this study, we aim to model the electrochemical CO-O coupling on configurationally disordered, multimetallic alloys, or high-entropy alloys (HEAs), within a six-element composition space consisting of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru. There is growing interest in HEAs for catalyst discovery due to their adjustable surface composition, which increases the likelihood of optimal active sites for specific reactions [25–27]. Research into the electro-oxidation of carbon monoxide [28–30], formic acid [31–35], methanol [31,33,36], ethanol [37,38], ethylene glycol [39], and glycerol [35] on HEAs has shown promising catalytic properties compared to their monometallic and bimetallic counterparts. However, exploring high-entropy alloys as a composition space presents several challenges. The extensive and multidimensional composition space makes experimental screening practically unfeasible without intelligent sampling methods [29,40]. While high-throughput methods can concurrently screen several hundred compositions [27,41–44], they fall short of comprehensively exploring the composition space when the number of elements grows large. This underscores the need for theoretical screenings to guide experimental efforts. Theory-driven studies are essential for navigating the expansive composition space characteristic of this material class. However, quantum mechanical methods such as density functional theory (DFT) are computationally demanding due to the millions of unique surface sites involved. This necessitates a regression model capable of recognizing local surface arrangements to predict adsorption energies of reaction intermediates, an area of active development [26,45–49]. Setting up a model for a reaction involves assumptions about the catalyst structure and the reaction environment, including the concentration and state of reactants and the electrolyte, temperature, and electrochemical potential. These assumptions combine to form new assumptions about the reaction mechanism, including intermediates involved, interactions between intermediates, interactions with the electrolyte, and relative rates of intermediate reactions. Assessing the validity of these assumptions in advance is challenging without leveraging available experimental observations [50]. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate how a single dataset of adsorption energies for *CO, *OH, and *O in a six-element composition space can be applied to various reaction models to identify potential catalyst candidates. These candidates can then be validated through experiments. A key aspect of this approach is that modeling assumptions may need to be revised based on experimental validation or invalidation. This iterative process—where assumptions are adjusted according to new evidence—plays a crucial role in refining the accuracy and relevance of the catalyst candidates. As two demonstrative examples, we consider how an initial set of assumptions may be set up to suggest catalyst candidates for CO-O coupling in (1) the methanol fuel cell and (2) the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell. 2 Methods 2.1 Sampling atomic structures in the high-entropy alloy composition space To create a versatile dataset of adsorption energies for the entire composition space of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru, we sampled compositions from a uniform Dirichlet distribution. This approach ensured equal probability for all compositions. The compositions were used as weighted probabilities to populate lattice sites randomly in face-centered cubic (fcc) slabs with (111) surface orientations. Although limited to disordered fcc(111) surfaces composed of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru, the methodology is applicable to other surface orientations, alloys, and catalytic systems. We included additional surface slabs with *CO and *OH adsorbed on Ru to expand the dataset, as subsurface Ru atoms significantly impact surface Ru atoms. The generated database encompassed 1770 *CO, 1433 *OH, and 1377 *O adsorption energies, totaling 4580 entries. This dataset served as input for the machine learning model to predict adsorption energies on any surface site. It has been made publicly available, along with the individual force relaxation steps, for use in more advanced machine learning methods. 2.2 Density functional theory simulations DFT calculations utilized the projector augmented wave (PAW) method in the GPAW software (version 22.8.0) [51]. The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [52] was employed for constructing initial geometries and visualizing optimized structures. The revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional [53] served as the exchange–correlation functional. Adsorption energy calculations were performed for *CO (at on-top sites), *OH (at on-top sites), and *O (at fcc hollow sites) on 3 × 3 atom-sized, periodically repeated, face-centered cubic (111) surface slabs with a five-layer thickness. The two bottom layers were fixed during force relaxation. The lattice constant of these slabs was set as the weighted average of the fcc lattice constants of the surface atoms, a strategy that eliminates finite size effects in 3x3 surface slabs of disordered alloys [54]. A 20 Å vacuum was applied between slabs. The energy cutoff of the plane wave basis set was 400 eV, and Brillouin zone sampling was carried out using a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid. Geometry relaxations continued until the forces on all atoms were below 0.075 eV/Å. To expedite dataset generation, each slab underwent initial force relaxation. The three studied adsorbates—*CO, *OH, and *O—were then placed on the nine possible on-top sites for *CO and *OH, and fcc hollow sites for *O. The surface slab with the adsorbate was subsequently relaxed. 2.3 Assumptions for the anode reaction of the direct methanol fuel cell To keep track of the assumptions made, we enumerate them with boldfaced integers. First, we review the assumptions shared between the two discussed cases. By construction of the dataset, (1) the catalyst is assumed to be an fcc lattice with only a (111) surface exposed. (2) *CO is assumed to adsorb on-top, (3) *OH is assumed to adsorb on-top, and (4) *O is assumed to adsorb in threefold fcc hollow sites. (5) We assume a temperature of 300 K and (6) standard conditions when evaluating reaction energies. As a necessary but not sufficient criterion for catalytic activity, we assume that the reacting adsorbates must be neighboring each other on the surface. Specifically, (7) when *CO is neighboring *OH, the two can react to form CO2 electrochemically when this is thermodynamically downhill in free energy. Similarly, (8) *CO neighboring *O in its next-nearest fcc hollow sites can react to form CO2 when energetically favorable. (9) The number of such reactive pairs per surface area constitutes a measure of catalytic activity that will be maximized during the tuning of the alloy composition. Regarding adsorbate interactions on the surface, we assumed that (10) any surface metal atom can maximally participate in adsorption to a single adsorbate at any time, (11) otherwise the adsorbates are non-interacting among each other. With regards to stability, we assume that (12) the surfaces remain disordered. Moreover, (13) the free energy of adsorption of CO is simulated assuming that the free energy of on-top adsorption of CO(g) on Cu(111) is zero, i.e., ΔG*CO@Cu(111) = 0, in an aqueous solution at a *CO coverage of 1/9th of a monolayer at 300 K. As the free energy of adsorption is difficult to obtain in both experiments and simulations at the relevant conditions, this should suffice as an approximation that is not expected to be too far off as estimated by simulations [55]. Fixing the free energy of *CO adsorption on Cu(111), and assuming that only the electronic DFT simulated energy changes between catalysts, also means that changes related to zero-point energy, heat capacity, entropy, and interaction between *CO and the electrolyte are accounted for when referencing electronic energies to that of Cu(111). Similarly, (14) the free energies of adsorption *OH and *O on Pt(111) are assumed equal to 0.76 eV and 2*0.76 eV (Supplementary Note 1), respectively, in an aqueous solution at 1/9th monolayer coverage at 300 K. This way of computing the free energy approximates the free energy corrections that would be expected in comparison to reference experiments without the need for obtaining these corrections through advanced modeling in simulations. To account for the reaction energies altered by the electrochemical potential in the simulations, (15) we use the computational hydrogen electrode framework [56], in which the energy difference between a proton-electron pair and gaseous hydrogen at standard conditions is assumed equal to the electrochemical bias potential when measured relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). To construct a complete model for the anode CO-O coupling reaction step, a set of assumptions about the reaction environment must also be made. These assumptions are labeled with boldface integers preceded by an uppercase ‘A’ to distinguish them from those in the subsequent case study. We assumed that (A1) methanol is present in high concentrations in an aqueous solution where methanol oxidizes readily to form surface-adsorbed CO when the free energy for this is downhill. This means that the surface is expected to have high coverages of *CO when *CO adsorption is favorable with respect to CO(g). After this initial methanol oxidation to *CO, it is assumed that (A2) water oxidizes to the most stable of either on-top *OH or fcc hollow *O on the catalyst surface, replacing adsorbed *CO by releasing it as gaseous CO, if necessary, when this is downhill in free energy. These assumptions align with the potential determining steps found in our prior work [57] but differ in that no poisoning by either adsorbate was considered previously. In this study, we account for poisoning by incorporating the order in which the adsorbates appear on the surface under the assumed steady-state reaction conditions. We note, however, that the opposite order could also be justified under the same experimental conditions. Indeed, several other assumptions could have been included in the above list. Relevant effects to consider in future models, especially in close feedback loops with experimental observations of the composition-activity landscape, include surface dynamics. This encompasses interactions between adsorbates, diffusion of adsorbates, and reaction barriers. Additionally, meta-stability phenomena such as clustering of atoms, segregation of subsurface atoms, and electrochemical dissolution of atoms at the applied potentials should be considered. Lastly, expanding the reaction mechanism may be necessary to align with experimental observations. This could involve breaking down the methanol oxidation reaction to surface-adsorbed CO and accounting for the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms involved. 2.4 Assumptions for the anode reaction of the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell In addition to the shared assumptions 1–15 above, for the hydrogen proton-exchange membrane fuel cell, we assumed that the parts per million level CO-contaminated, and slightly humidified, H2 fuel causes the anode catalyst to initially be in chemical equilibrium with adsorbed *OH/*O species. The modeling assumption is thus that (B1) the most stable of on-top *OH or fcc hollow *O at the given electrochemical potential will adsorb when this is thermodynamically favorable. This is followed by (B2) adsorption of CO at available on-top sites where this is energetically favorable. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Training the adsorption energy regressor To enable predictions of adsorption energies for arbitrary surface sites, we constructed features to describe the atomic surface configuration around the adsorption sites in the DFT simulations. For *CO and *OH, we assumed on-top adsorption models. The features consisted of the count of neighboring elements around an adsorption site, divided into zones corresponding to surface, subsurface, and third layer atoms (Fig. S1) [58]. For *O adsorption, we modeled it as an fcc hollow adsorption, where the features consisted of a one-hot encoding of the identity of the three surface atoms in the three-atomic site (Fig. S1). With six metals, this corresponds to 56 possible combinations. Next, we fitted a linear regression model on the sets of features. For *CO and *OH on-top adsorption, we constructed a linear regressor for each of the six metals to capture the perturbations from the surrounding atoms to each metal individually. The predictions of leave-one-out cross-validations are shown in Fig. 1 . If the points in Fig. 1 had been perfectly aligned along the diagonal, the regression would have been ideal, with simulated adsorption energies exactly matching the predicted values. In practice, mean absolute errors of 68, 69, and 137 meV are observed for *CO, *OH, and *O adsorption, respectively. Visual inspection of the histograms of prediction errors in the insets suggests that the errors are normally distributed, indicating no systematic bias and that the variations in the predictions are random. We tested the impact of the uncertainty in the DFT predictions by adding normally distributed white noise to the predictions with increasing standard deviation. The result on the trend in activity of binary Ag-Ru was tested, and we found that the trends in compositions were unaltered even when mean absolute errors were increased to above 100 meV for all three adsorbates (Figs. S2, S3). The choice of a linear regression model was based on three criteria: 1) the regressor must be flexible enough to predict adsorption energies across the entire composition space, 2) it must be fast enough to provide predictions on thousands of surface sites across thousands of compositions in a matter of hours, and 3) it must be simple in its implementation and interpretation to allow for easy adoption by researchers. The chosen features, combined with linear regression, also limit the model's applicability. The *CO and *OH adsorption energies were required to conform to on-top adsorption sites, which meant that bridge and hollow site adsorptions were discarded during the training of the model. This resulted in up to 57 % of the structures being omitted in the case of *OH on Cu, as Cu sites were likely to prefer bridge and hollow site adsorptions under the vacuum conditions of the DFT simulations. It is likely that hydrogen bonding with an electrolyte, had it been included, would lessen the tendency of *OH moving to higher coordinated sites, justifying the dismissal of these structures. The uniform sampling of structures in the 6-element composition space means that the prediction errors in Fig. 1 reflect predictions on structures of any composition, providing the desired flexibility across the entire composition space. In the simulations that follow, it takes 0.4 s on a single processor to compute adsorption energies of *CO, *OH, and *O on 10,000 surface sites. In comparison, it takes between 2–8 s to evaluate the activity of 10,000 surface sites at a single potential. Evaluating 14 potentials and 3003 compositions, corresponding to a 10 atomic percent (at.%) sampling of the 6-element composition space, brings the total exploration time of the composition space to about 58 h. Parallelization over a few processors makes this exploration an overnight endeavor. 3.2 Composition optimization of the anode catalyst of the direct methanol fuel cell Following the assumptions listed in section 2.3, we simulated the filling of a 100x100 atom surface at various electrochemical potentials. The 100x100 atom surface provides a constructive cut-off for the size of the surface, as this size yields converged pair coverages with an error of less than 0.005 of a monolayer compared to larger surface sizes (Figs. S4, S5). Initially, methanol was allowed to oxidatively adsorb as *CO (assumption A1). Subsequently, water was allowed to oxidatively adsorb as *OH or *O, potentially expending the energy required to remove *CO in the process (assumption A2). We then counted the number of *CO–*OH and *CO–*O pairs, including only those with a negative free energy for forming CO2 (assumptions 7–9). This procedure was conducted on compositions of the 6-element alloy in steps of 10 at.% for potentials between 0.10 and 1.10 V vs RHE in steps of 0.10 V. The resulting interpolated catalytic activity function is shown in Fig. 2 for three highlighted potentials. The local maxima of the activity function are determined using a radial basis function interpolation and are shown in the plot. One notable aspect is the smoothness of the activity function across the shown potentials. As the composition changes, the variation in activity changes only relatively slowly. One way to quantify this smoothness is by fitting the characteristic length scale, a measure of the correlation length, of a Gaussian process regressor with a squared exponential correlation function [40]. This results in length scales ranging from 14 to 23 at.%, decreasing with the applied potential for the direct methanol fuel cell (Fig. S5). This correlation length is considerably shorter than the 40 at.% previously observed for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction [40]. This suggests that the dual-site CO-O coupling reaction results in a more rugged activity landscape compared to the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to more local optima in the composition space. Thermodynamically, the water-assisted oxidation of methanol (Eq. (4) at standard conditions and 300 K becomes spontaneous at potentials above +0.01 V vs RHE. (4) CH3OH(l) + H2O(l) → CO2(g) + 6(H+ + e-) With a 0.09 monolayer (ML) of reactive *CO–*OH/*O pairs, Ag61Cu39 is the optimal composition predicted at 0.6 V vs RHE, the lowest potential at which we register non-zero catalytic activities under the simulated assumptions. As the potential increases, the shape of the activity function changes. At 0.8 V vs RHE, Ag-Cu binaries are inactive, and the global optimum shifts to a Ag30Cu43Pd27 ternary composition with a local optimum at binary Cu71Pd29. As the potential increases to 1.0 V vs RHE, a potential no longer relevant for practical applications of the direct methanol fuel cell due to the overpotential associated with the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode, the binary Cu39Pd61 dominates the activity landscape with a distinct ‘tail’ of activity extending into the center of the Ag-Cu-Pd ternary space. Fig. 3 illustrates the evolution of optimal compositions at each simulated potential. In Fig. 3a, it can be observed how different regions of the 6-element composition space dominate the activity at different potentials. At potentials below 0.6 V vs RHE, no catalytic activity is predicted. Between 0.6 and 0.7 V vs RHE, binary Ag-Cu catalysts are predicted to be most active. At 0.8–0.9 V vs RHE, ternary Ag-Cu-Pd compositions take over as the global optimum until binary Cu-Pd systems dominate the activity above 0.9 V vs RHE. Inspection of Fig. 3a reveals that Cu is an essential component in the optimal compositions across all relevant potentials. Considering that Cu may dissolve into solution at these elevated anode potentials (Fig. S6), it is useful to explore an optimization excluding Cu. This optimization produces near-equimolar Ag-Pd-Ru alloys above 0.8 V, but no active alloys below this potential, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. Inspection of the surface states of Ag61Cu39, the optimal composition at 0.6 V vs RHE, at various potentials reveals that methanol oxidation to *CO is predicted to occur on Cu on-top sites as early as 0.1 V vs RHE (Fig. S7). Water oxidation to *OH is predicted to be feasible on Cu sites at 0.6 V vs RHE, as is the oxidation of *CO–*OH pairs on the surface to yield CO2. The influence of Ag on the activity is thus only as a ligand, perturbing the adsorption energies at Cu sites. The ligand perturbation achieves an optimum between the number of reactive Cu-Cu neighbor pairs and adsorption strength at about a 3:2 ratio between the two elements. It is worth mentioning that both pure surfaces of Ag and Cu are predicted to have zero activity at all investigated potentials. At potentials greater than 0.7 V vs RHE, Ag61Cu39 becomes inactive as the Cu surface atoms become covered with *OH species, removing *CO as CO(g) in the process (Fig. S7). To address the effect of refining the reaction assumptions on the predicted optimal compositions, we refined assumption 11 in section 2.3 to include linear adsorbate–adsorbate interactions between all three adsorbates at neighboring sites. This analysis yielded optimal Ru-rich compositions with traces of Cu and Pt, showing non-zero activities at potentials as low as 0.1 V vs RHE (Fig. S8). At higher potentials, the activity landscape is dominated by binary Pt-Ru and Cu-Pd-Pt alloys (Fig. S9). 3.3 Composition optimization of the anode catalyst of the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell The second case investigated was the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell anode CO oxidation reaction (Eq. (5). This reaction becomes thermodynamically spontaneous at potentials above −0.21 V vs RHE at 300 K. (5) CO(g) + H2O(l) → CO2(g) + 2(H+ + e-) In accordance with the assumptions in section 2.4, water was initially allowed to adsorb as the most favorable of *OH and *O (assumption B1), followed by adsorption of CO at sites where this was energetically favorable (assumption B2). The predicted activity function is shown at four different potentials in Fig. 4 , and the optimal compositions are plotted against the applied potential in Fig. 5 . At potentials below 0.4 V vs RHE, Ag-Cu-Ru alloys are predicted to be active toward CO oxidation (Fig. 4a,b and Fig. 5a). This is similar to the Ag-Cu optima for the methanol fuel cell anode, except that Ru now enhances the activity. Inspection of the simulated surface states of Ag11Cu58Ru31, the optimal composition at 0.0 V vs RHE, across the potential sweep reveals that *CO and *OH neighboring pairs on Cu and Ru sites, respectively, can form as early as −0.2 V vs RHE. However, it is not until 0.0 V vs RHE that these pairs can be oxidized to CO2 in substantial amounts (Fig. S10). As with the methanol anode, Ag atoms act as spectators that favorably perturb the adsorption energies for the CO-tolerant fuel cell anode. To confirm that our linear regressor provides accurate predictions at the found optimal compositions, we sampled additional *CO and *OH DFT adsorption energies on Cu and Ru, respectively, on surfaces of Ag11Cu58Ru31. These were found to be the sites responsible for the activity at low overpotentials. The prediction errors are indeed even lower on this ternary alloy than for the whole composition space, with mean absolute errors below 50 meV (Fig. S11), providing credibility to the found optimum under the current modeling assumptions. At a potential of 0.6 V vs RHE, virtually no Ru is needed in the optimal catalyst (Fig. 5a), and Ag-Cu binary compositions constitute the global optimum. This is the same binary alloy found for the methanol fuel cell anode at the same potential, although a slightly higher Cu ratio is preferred for the hydrogen fuel cell. As with the methanol fuel cell anode, inspection of the surface state of the Ag36Cu63Ru1 optimum reveals that sufficient *OH adsorbates can adsorb at Cu sites at 0.6 V vs RHE for this composition to be active in a relatively narrow potential range before being inactivated by oxygen adsorption at potentials above 0.7 V vs RHE (Fig. S12). Due to their higher surface oxidation potentials, Pd-Pt binary alloys are predicted to be the most active at potentials above 0.6 V vs RHE (Fig. 5a). The predicted activity of these alloys stems from the fact that *OH can form on Pt sites, which can oxidize neighboring *CO adsorbed on either Pd or Pt sites (Fig. S13). Considering that the Cu-based compositions could be short-lived in practical applications, an optimization without Cu was also carried out (Fig. 5b). The results show that Ru-rich Ru-Pd/Pt alloys are active at potentials above 0.1 V vs RHE. The active sites for these alloys are identified as *CO and *OH/*O on Pd and Ru sites, respectively (Fig. S14). Interestingly, an equimolar ratio between Ru and Pd/Pt is not found to be optimal, despite many hollow sites of Ru having inactive *O adsorbed. The reason for this observation is that the active Ru-*OH sites are those that can adsorb *OH without adsorbing too strongly. By inspecting the individual predictions of Ru adsorption energies, it becomes evident that a clear distinguishing feature of the adsorption energies on Ru is the number of subsurface Ru neighbor atoms (Fig. S15). The adsorption strength on Ru on-top sites decreases with increasing numbers of Ru subsurface neighbors and reaches a minimum when three subsurface Ru neighbors are coordinating. Thus, to increase the probability of subsurface Ru neighbors and weaken the *OH adsorption, high concentrations of Ru are needed in the alloy. 4 Conclusions In this study, we showed that a single dataset containing hundreds of *CO, *OH, and *O adsorption energies on diverse surface sites of a six-metal, disordered Ag-Au-Cu-Pd-Pt-Ru high-entropy alloy can effectively guide the optimization of alloy composition for catalytic processes involving the coupling of *CO with surface oxygen species through simulations. By applying different sets of reaction assumptions, the same DFT simulations can be adapted to various scenarios, leading to different outcomes regarding the identity of active sites and, therefore, the optimal compositions. We applied this optimization framework to two cases: the direct methanol fuel cell anode and the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell anode. Our analysis, based on specific assumptions regarding the availability of *CO and *OH/*O species on the catalyst surface, identified different optimal catalysts for each case. Notably, Ag-Cu binary catalysts emerged as key candidates in both scenarios. For the CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cell, Ag-Cu-Ru and Pd-Pt-Ru ternary alloys were identified as promising catalysts at low overpotentials. Given the sensitivity of our assumptions on the predicted catalyst candidates, our findings highlight the critical need for iterative experimental validation of the predicted catalytic activities on multimetallic alloys. If discrepancies emerge between experimental results and predictions, it will be necessary to adjust the modeling assumptions accordingly. This iterative process will improve the reliability of our approach, ultimately leading to the discovery of optimal catalysts. This approach to catalysis modeling emphasizes that the primary challenge in accurately simulating experimental observations lies not in generating the atomistic data, but in validating the assumptions underlying the model.

        "dc:description": "Catalytically joining carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms is crucial for various environmental and industrial applications. However, the reaction environments for this process vary significantly across different applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how reaction environments and associated modeling assumptions influence the predictions of optimal disordered alloy catalysts for CO-O coupling. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising several hundred *CO, *OH, and *O simulated adsorption energies on atomically disordered face-centered cubic (111) surfaces composed of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, and Ru. This dataset is provided alongside this publication to support further machine learning-based searches for optimal CO-O coupling catalysts within this composition space for any CO-O coupling application. We illustrate the impact of different modeling assumptions on the identification of CO-O coupling catalysts through two key examples: electrochemical methanol oxidation and CO-tolerant hydrogen fuel cells.",
