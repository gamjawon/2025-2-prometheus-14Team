The spherical magnesium chloride (MgCl2)-supported methylaluminoxane (MAO) pre-catalysts were prepared using MgCl2·2.6EtOH adduct as support material subjected to elimination of EtOH by thermal treatments. The pre-catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), IR, 27Al solid-state NMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 BET surface areas. Under the activation of triethylaluminum (TEA), polymerization of ethylene were carried out by contacting supported MAO with soluble dichloro(rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl))zirconium (rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2) prior to polymerization. As a result, the polymers with spherical form morphology and high bulk density (over 0.35g/cm3) were obtained. The addition of cross-linking agents (CAs) during the adsorption of MAO on the support (e.g. glycol, glycerol and triethanolamine) led to an increase in Al content from 3.8 to 9–12wt.% and in the catalyst activity. The highest activity in ethylene polymerization (3.48×107 g polyethylene (PE)/(mol Zrh)) was achieved in the case of using glycerol as CA. Keywords Ethylene Methylaluminoxane Supported pre-catalyst Spherical MgCl2 Cross-linking agent 1 Introduction The catalysts for olefin polymerization derived from metallocene compounds and methylaluminoxane (MAO) have been intensively investigated in the past few years. Although, homogeneous metallocene possesses unprecedented olefin polymerization activity and selectivity, it must be heterogenized for drop-in replacement in slurry or gas-phase plant. Silica (SiO2) is the most employed carrier for heterogeneous metallocene catalysts [1–7], while use of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) as carrier is not widely reported in the literature. For the lack of hydroxyls on the surface of MgCl2, which is different from SiO2, it is difficult to support metallocenes or MAO on MgCl2 firmly. The main synthetic routes reported in the literature for metallocenes immobilization on MgCl2 can be generally classified according to the preparatory method of carrier as follows: direct impregnation on ball-milling anhydrous MgCl2 [8–10]; adsorption on MgCl2 synthesized by the reaction between dibutylmagesium and tert-butyl chloride [11] or by Grignard reagent decomposition [12–14]; direct impregnation on spherical MgCl2 prepared by de-alcoholation of MgCl2·nEtOH adduct [15]. All these aforementioned MgCl2-supported metallocene catalysts need to use trialkylaluminium or MAO as co-catalyst. When trialkylaluminiums were used as co-catalyst, instead of MAO, catalyst showed modest activity [8–10,12]. In the case of MAO employed as co-catalyst, catalyst activity increased compared to the former case, but the amount of MAO was still high (Al/Zr>1000) and the problem of poor polymer morphology can not be solved because external MAO might leach some adsorbed metallocene species during the polymerization process [11,13–5]. In order to overcome above problems, we have developed a novel method for preparing spherical MgCl2-supported MAO pre-catalysts, in combination with metallocenes, which produced polymers with high bulk density and desired spherical morphology [16–18]. The supported pre-catalysts are prepared by immobilizing MAO on the spherical MgCl2 only and polymerization starts immediately after contacting the pre-catalysts with soluble metallocenes, which eliminates the need for a supporting and separate step of metallocenes. No additional MAO is required, the catalytic system can be activated with common alkyl aluminum. This polymerization process is similar to that of SiO2 in-site supported metallocene catalyst, reported by Soares and co-workers [19–21]. The spherical MgCl2 has been the common used support in the conventional Ziegler–Natta catalysts [22,23]. But as far as we are aware, there appears to have been few reports on spherical MgCl2-supported MAO pre-catalysts. In this paper, we describe the preparation of the pre-catalysts and their use in the polymerization of ethylene. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Solvents (n-hexane and toluene) and gases (ethylene and nitrogen) were purchased from commercial sources and purified according to the usual procedures. Dichloro(rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl))zirconium (rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2) and spherical MgCl2·nEtOH adduct (n=2.6, measured by TG analysis) were donated from Brici, China. Glycol, glycerol and triethanolamine (reagent grade, Beijing Chem. Co., China) were all dried with 4Å molecular sieve and stored under nitrogen. MAO (in toluene solution) and triethylaluminum (TEA) were purchased from Ethyl Co., USA and used without further purification. All the chemicals were manipulated in inert atmosphere using the Schlenk technique. 2.2 Support preparation Ten grams of spherical MgCl2·2.6EtOH adducts were heated under a stream of N2 at 250°C for 4h, as a result, 4.5g supports were obtained. 2.3 Pre-catalysts preparation All the supported MAO pre-catalysts were prepared according to the following typical procedures. MgCl2/MAO: 12ml of MAO (1.8M toluene solution) was added to 3g of supports in 30ml of toluene, followed by vigorous stirring of mixture at 70°C for 4h. The solid part was then washed with toluene and dried in vacuum. MgCl2/MAO/cross-linking agent (CA) (e.g. glycol, glycerol or triethanolamine): 12ml of MAO (1.8M toluene solution) and an appropriate amount of CAs were added to 3g of supports in 30ml of toluene. A mixture was vigorously stirred at 70°C for 4h. The solid part was then washed with toluene and dried in vacuum. 2.4 Characterization of supports and pre-catalysts Power XRD patterns of samples were obtained with a Philips instrument, model X’Pert equipped with a source using a Cu anode, operating at 40kV and 40mA for Cu Kα radiation. The sample was covered with an amorphous polyethylene (PE) film to avoid air contact. The diffraction pattern was recorded in the range of 10°<2θ<70°. The IR spectra were recorded on the Magna-IR spectrophotometers. The samples of the support and pre-catalysts for IR examination were prepared in glove box as Nujol mulls in KBr pellets and a solid MAO sample was analyzed with infrared microscope. The Al contents of the supported MAO pre-catalysts were determined by titrimetry, after acid extraction and by complexometry with EDTA using dithizone as indicator. The 27 Al solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at 104.3MHz on a Varian Unity Plus 400 spectrometer. The number of accumulation was ca. 5000 with a pulse width of 3μs and 0.5s delay between the pulses. Chemical shifts were referenced to the external 1M aqueous solution of AlCl3. Prior to spectra recording, samples were transferred in a glove box and packed into 7.0mm diameter zirconia rotors. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were carried out on a Cambridge S-250 Mk3. The samples were mounted on specimen holder and coated with gold. The employed accelerating voltage was 19kV. The specific surface areas and the pore size distribution were measured by N2 adsorption using the BET method with CE-Instruments Milestone 200. 2.5 Polymerization of ethylene All polymerizations were carried out in a 2l stainless steel autoclave reactor. Prior to polymerization, the spherical MgCl2-supported MAO pre-catalyst was brought into contact with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 in toluene solution. One liter of n-hexane and 2mmol of TEA were added to the reactor at room temperature under nitrogen purging, followed by the addition of mixture of supported MAO pre-catalyst and soluble metallocene. Then the reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature (80°C). The polymerizations were started by the pressurizing of the reactor with ethylene (total pressure=15bar) and the polymerization temperature was maintained within ±0°C of the set point. The polymerizations were carried out for 1h and then were terminated by venting the gaseous monomer, instead of by injecting some alcohols into the reactor. 2.6 Characterization of the polymers The polymer melting points (T m) were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a Perkin–Elmer DSC-7. The analyses were performed with a heating rate of 10°C/min in the temperature range of 25–200°C. The bulk density of the polymer particles was measured according to ASTM Standard D 1895. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The adsorption of MAO on MgCl2 It is well known that the thermal treatment of MgCl2·nEtOH adduct with irregular morphology obtained by ball-milling method at temperature of 250°C removes EtOH completely [24]. But for spherical MgCl2·2.6EtOH adduct in this paper, after thermal de-alcoholation, the small amounts of EtOH may be retained inside of the MgCl2 support. Fig. 1 presents IR spectra recorded for alcoholate, support and pre-catalysts. IR spectrum of a MgCl2·2.6EtOH sample (Fig. 1a) exhibits a broad band at 3400cm−1, corresponding to OH groups in EtOH and a feature peak at 1404cm−1 attributable to alcoholate. After thermal de-alcoholation (Fig. 1b), the peak concerning alcoholate (1404cm−1) almost disappears, while there still is a weak peak at 3400cm−1, suggesting that EtOH was not completely removed during the thermal treatment, probably due to the entrapment within MgCl2 structure. Fig. 1c shows the IR spectra of solid MAO, in which a band at 870cm−1 can be assigned to the AlO bond [25]. After the direct adsorption of MAO on the support (Fig. 1d) or further addition of CA during the preparation of supported pre-catalyst (Fig. 1e), it is observed that the band corresponding to AlO group is displaced at a lower frequency, showing a doublet at 810 and 720cm−1. It seems that in MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst, the MAO is coordinated to MgCl2 through oxygen to Mg2+ and its possible structure is shown in Fig. 3. It is worthwhile note, in Fig. 1d and e, that a tine minority of EtOH still exists in MgCl2/MAO or MgCl2/MAO/glycerol, since the residual OH signal is observed in IR spectra of them. The results of corresponding 27 Al solid-state NMR experiments are shown in Fig. 2 . The chemical shift of solid MAO sample (Fig. 2a) is approximately 154ppm, which agrees well with the literature data [26]. After the adsorption of MAO on MgCl2 (Fig. 2b), the 27 Al NMR line shifts to higher magnetic field and the chemical shift decreases (154→146ppm ). It is known that the increase of the coordination number moves the chemical shift towards higher magnetic field [27,28]. So, the above change of chemical shift shows the presence of Cl→Al dative links (Fig. 3 ), which is another interaction between MAO and MgCl2, besides the coordination through oxygen to Mg2+ (vide ante). Fig. 2c shows the 27 Al solid-state NMR spectrum of sample MgCl2/MAO/glycerol with 150ppm of chemical shift and the tendency of decrease of chemical shift is not remarkable, for in the sample MgCl2/MAO/glycerol some MAO is supported by the cross-linking reaction with glycerol (vide infra). Fig. 4a is the XRD pattern of the support obtained after the elimination of EtOH, which presents reflections at d=1.82, 2.58, 2.94 and 5.87Å related to MgCl2 (in agreement with the literature [24]) and d=4.08Å related to PE film. Fig. 4b and c show the XRD pattern of MgCl2/MAO and MgCl2/MAO/glycerol, respectively, which are both similar to that of the support (Fig. 4a). The MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst containing 3.8wt.% of Al, was brought into contact with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the polymerization of ethylene was initiated under the activation of TEA. The result obtained is listed in Table 1 , run 1. The MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst demonstrates moderate activity of 1.48×107 g PE/(mol Zrh). Compared to analog SiO2-supported MAO pre-catalysts with 12wt.% of Al and activity of 2.71×107 g PE/(mol Zrh) [29], the lower Al content of MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst give rise to the lower activity. 3.2 The effect of CAs on the properties of pre-catalyst It has been found that MAO can react with aliphatic or aromatic diols under the evolution of methane gas and formation of three-dimensional lattices [30–33]. In order to increase the Al contents in the spherical MgCl2-supported MAO pre-catalyst, we added some CA (e.g. glycol, glycerol and triethanolamine) during the adsorption of MAO on the support. The results obtained are listed in Table 1. As the CA content added to pre-catalyst system increases, the supported Al content in pre-catalyst increases as well, suggesting that some MAO is supported through the cross-linking reaction with CA as shown in Fig. 5 . But in every kind of pre-catalyst containing CA, the pre-catalyst with the highest Al content do not show the highest activity (Table 1, runs 4, 7 and 10), indicating that more addition of CA leads to uncompleted reaction in Fig. 5 and the existence of remainder hydroxyls, as a result of decrease in catalyst activity. Among three CAs, glycerol shows the highest performance and when the mole ratio of OH/Al is 0.2, the highest activity is 3.48×107 g PE/mol Zrh (Table 1, run 6). 3.3 The morphology, BET areas and pore volume distribution Fig. 6 and Table 2 present the morphological and N2 BET surface areas information during the preparation of the supported MAO pre-catalyst, respectively. The SEM photographs illustrated in Fig. 6a, c and e clearly indicate that the original spherical form of MgCl2·2.6C2H5OH was kept in the MgCl2 support and resulting MgCl2/MAO/glycerol pre-catalyst. But there are some dramatic changes on the surface appearance among MgCl2·2.6C2H5OH, support and pre-catalyst. The MgCl2·2.6C2H5OH has a rough smooth and less porous surface (Fig. 6b), in accordance with very low surface areas and pore volume (Table 2, no. 1), while the MgCl2 support becomes porous and loose because of elimination of C2H5OH (Fig. 6d), in agreement with large surface areas and pore volume (Table 2, no. 2). Apparently the porous surface structure of MgCl2 support allow complete penetration of MAO (Fig. 6f), being in favor of supporting MAO on MgCl2 firmly and reduce the occurrence of leaching for MAO from the supported pre-catalyst. The SEM photograph (Fig. 7 ) of polymers prepared with MgCl2/MAO/glycerol pre-catalyst shows that the replication of spherical catalyst morphology have been achieved successfully, indicating that the supported catalyst has a uniform distribution of active sites and high porosity [34]. Fig. 8a and b show the differential pore volume distribution of supported pre-catalysts during the preparation. It is seen from Fig. 8a that the pores with 40–60nm diameters on the support surface are firstly filled with MAO and new pores with 120–150nm diameters appear on MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst. As a result, the surface areas and pore volumes of MgCl2/MAO pre-catalyst increase greatly compared to those of MgCl2 support (Table 2). Fig. 8b reveals that more MAO adsorbed on the support by cross-linking reaction are filled in the pores just generated with 120–150nm diameters. As a consequence, the surface area of the supported pre-catalyst increases further, but pore volume decreases (Table 2). 4 Conclusions We have developed a novel spherical MgCl2-supported MAO pre-catalyst using spherical MgCl2·nEtOH as support material. Spherical polymers with high bulk density can be produced by means of contacting supported MAO with metallocene prior to polymerization. It was found that both the Al content and catalytic activity had been greatly improved after the addition of CA (e.g. glycol, glycerol and triethanolamine) during the adsorption of MAO on support.
