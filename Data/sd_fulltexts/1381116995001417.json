The structural evolution of Mo/A1203 gel was investigated by using 2'Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). 27Al NMR of Mo/A1203 has been compared with that of pure alumina. The addition of molybdenum species to alumina sol was to have no effect on the alumina structure when the molybdenum loading was lower than 20%. No incorporation of molybdenum species to alumina lattice was observed and the finely dispersed MOSz crystallite on the support was obtained upon sulfidation. However, an A12 NOW 3 phase, which was an indication of the interaction between A1203 and M003, was formed on the alumina surface when molybdenum loading was higher than 20%. All molybdenum species were accessible by reactant molecules regardless of molybdenum loading. Keywords: z'Al NMR; Sol-gel; Hydrodesulfurization; Alumina; Molybdenum; Aluminum molybdate 1. Introduction The sol-gel processing [ 1 ] has been a popular subject in ceramic's research due to its inherent advantages such as molecular level mixing, low vitrification temperature, and facile control of composition. Possibility of applying the sol-gel processing to the preparation of impregnated catalyst was proposed and tested [ 2-6] . The sol-gel processing of catalyst involves hydrolysis of the precursor for support and addition of the active metal species at the due steps. In this process, the primary concern is to know the location, dispersion, and morphology of the active components. * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/96/$09.50 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00141-7 Gomez et al. prepared sol-gel catalysts by adding metals, such as, Pt, Pd and Ru, before gelation [ 2-4] . They reported that part of the metal (M = Pt, Pd, Ru) was incorporated into the silica network as Si-O-M or was formed into emerged particles, which lead to metal-support interactions that were different from those of conventionally impregnated catalysts. The alumina framework was reported to be modified by the incorporation of molybdenum in sol-gel catalysts when the molybdenum precursor was mixed with the aluminum alkoxide before hydrolysis [ 5 ] . When the molybdenum precursor was mixed with alumina Sol, fine crystallites of molybdenum oxide are deposited on the alumina 286 LH. Cho et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 104 (1996) 285-291 surface without modifying the alumina framework [6]. In this paper, Mo/A1203 catalysts were prepared by adding (CH3COCH=C (O-) CH3)2MO02 (Mo-acac) to the alumina sol. The effect of molybdenum precursor addition on the structural change of alumina sol, gel, and final calcined sample was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and 2'Al NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) technique, which has been used for investigating the environment of the aluminum atoms during hydrolysis and gelation of aluminum alkoxide [7-10]. Thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity at various molybdenum loadings was also reported. 2. Experimental The preparation procedure of the Mo/A1203 catalysts by sol-gel method following Yoldas [ 11,12] was shown in Fig. 1. First, aluminum isopropoxide (AIP; Junsei, 99%) was hydrolyzed at 85 for 30 min with water to an AIP mole ratio of 100. This solution was then peptized by adding HN03 (Junsei; HN03/AlP =0.2 mol ratio) and transparent sol of aluminum monohydroxide AI(OC3Hi)3 + H20 (HZO/AIP=100) Heating to 85 with stirring for 30 min .VfHN03 (HN03/AIP=0.02) Formation of clear sol i4--MO-acac dissolved in Ethanol Gellation and drying at RT for 24 h Drying at 110 for 12 h Calcination at 500 for 5 h Mo/A1203 sol-gel catalyst Fig. 1. Preparation procedure of Mo/AIZOi sol-gel catalyst. [5,11,12] was obtained. After the peptized sol was stirred at 85 for 12 h, Mo-acac (Aldrich), dissolved in ethanol, was mixed with this transparent alumina sol. The resulting green solution was stirred vigorously at 85 for 1 h and dried at room temperature for 24 h and subsequently at 110 for 12 h. The dried gel was calcined at 500 for 5 h under air flow, followed by sulfidation with 10 mol% H2S/H2 mixture (200 ml min-') at 400 for 2 h. The Mo/A1203 gel was white and turned into black upon sulfidation. A series of Mo/A1203 samples, with 11, 20, 28, 35 and 41 % loading based on A1203, was prepared. Pure alumina without adding Mo precursor was also prepared by the same procedure. The solid state 2'Al NMR was obtained at 296 K using a Bruker AM-300 FT-NMR spectrometer with magic angle spinning (MAS) units. Operating frequency of 2'Al was 78.2 MHz, and the sample was spun at 3.5 kHz. The spectrum was obtained with 100-200 acquisitions repeated with 2-s recycle delay and 3-,tt,s pulse width (30pulse angle). The chemical shift was referenced with respect to the 2' Al signal of (Al (H20) 6 ) 3 +. All the2'AI NMR spectra were directly obtained for freshly prepared samples without hydration treatment. XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku D/MAX-RB equipped with CuKa X-ray source. TEM micrographs were obtained using a Philips Model CM20. The TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the ground catalyst in ethanol and then dropping a drop of the dispersed catalyst on a copper grid coated by carbon film. Thiophene HDS reaction were conducted in a packed-bed reactor with 1 mol% C4H4S/H2 (250 ml min-') under atmospheric pressure. The amount of catalyst was fixed at 0.25 gram and the bed temperature was set at 400. The reactants and products were analyzed by an on-line HP 5840A GC with a flame ionized detector (FID). 3.

At\"' and AI denote the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated aluminum, respectively. Spinning side bands are marked by asterisks. alumina Sol, Fig. 2a, was consistent with other reports that gave a resonance peak near 0 ppm [ 7,8] . The Z-'Al chemical shift is governed primarily by the coordination number of aluminum atoms. The chemical shift for octahedral aluminum varies in the range of 0-20 ppm relative to ( AI ( H20 ) 6) + whereas the chemical shift for tetrahedral aluminum is within 50-80 ppm relative to the same reference [ 13 ] . According Fig. 2a, there are almost no tetrahedral aluminum atoms in the alumina sol. The Z'Al NMR spectrum obtained right after peptization was identical to the one obtained 8 h after peptization. Electrostatic attraction and repulsions inhibit the agglomeration, thus a stable sol is maintained during peptization process. Fig. 2b shows the solid-state Z'Al NMR spectrum of alumina gel dried at 110. The spectrum was broader than that of alumina Sol, and only one resonance at 4 ppm was observed. It indicates that there is no phase transformation during the drying of alumina Sol. The small peaks on both sides of the main resonance peak were spinning side bands. However, heat treatment of the alumina gel at 300 induced marked changes in the 2'Al NMR spectrum as shown in Fig. 2c. Dwivedi and Gowda [ 14] obtain the same result. Some octahedral Al was transformed to tetrahedral Al showing resonance at 53 ppm. The Z'Al NMR spectrum of alumina gel after heat treatment at 500 (Fig. 2d) was very similar to the spectrum of yalumina. XRD also revealed the formation of yA1103 from the AIP-derived gel heated at 500 ( Fig. 4a) . 3.2.

The \"Al NMR spectrum of Mo/AL,O3 gel at Mo loading < 20% was almost same as that of alumina gel.

XRD peaks, shown in Fig. 4, are consistent with the NMR result. A12(M004)3 peaks appeared above 20% molybdenum loading. Fig. 5 shows the changes of solid state 2' Al NMR spectrum of 41% Mo/A1203- When the samples were calcined above 500, A12(M004) 3 phase appeared and the amount of this phase increased with calcination time (Fig. 5c and d). These results indicate that the interaction between y-A1203 and M003 is significant when molybdenum loading is higher than 20%. Fig. 6 shows XRD patterns of Mo/A1203 gel before and after sulfidation process. The aluminum molybdate phase disappeared with sulfidation treatment. This observation suggests that the A12(Mo04)3 phase is present on the surface of alumina and reacts easily with H2S. From these results, we can conclude that, when the molybdenum loading lower than 20%, molybdenum species are distributed over the alumina gel structure without being incorporated into the alumina network, but when the loading is over 20%, the A12 ( M004) 3 compound is formed on the outside surface of alumina gel.

HDS activity of the sol-gel catalyst The thiophene conversion as a function of molybdenum loading is shown in Fig. 7. The conversion increases at molybdenum loadings up to 30%. For a conventionally impregnated Mo/ A120g catalyst, the maximum activity is known to be present at 12-15% molybdenum loading which is the limit of monolayer formation of molybdenum in the surface of alumina [ 16] . In contrast to the impregnated catalyst, for the sol-gel catalysts, HDS activity did not decrease at molybdenum loading higher than 15%. It should be noted that the conversion was doubled as the loading was increased from 11 % to 20%. This is an important result indicating that most of the Mo atoms are accessible by the reactants. Fig. 8 shows a typical TEM micrograph of the sulfided Mo/A1203 gel. It contains groups of black parallel lines which are from crystalline sheets of MOSZ in a highly dispersed form. The highly dispersed form of MOS2 are known to be contributed to the high level of the thiophene HDS activity for Mo/A1,03 catalysts [ 17]. The structure of MoS2 slabs using TEM has been investigated by other researchers [ 18-20]. The structure of the oxidic precursor of MoS, phase can be described as an oligomeric species of molybdenum which is formed in an early stage. When (CH3COCH=C(O-)CHi)2Mo0, dissolved in ethanol is added to the alumina sol, it is expected that molybdenum species become oligomeric clusters resulting from the partial hydrolysis and polymerization of Mo-acac. The oligomeric clusters, after sulfidation process, could be evolved to be partially sulfided clusters and eventually reduced to an MoS, slab [ 18 ] . The decrease of thiophene conversion for Mo/ A1203 at molybdenum loading above 30% can be explained by the sharp decrease of surface area as shown in Table 1. The BET surface area of Mo/ A1203 gel below 20% molybdenum loading was in the range 150-200 m' g-', which was larger than that of pure alumina gel ( 152 m' g - I ) . However, the BET surface areas of Mo/A1,0; gel with 41 wt.-% Mo03 loading were 43 m'- g '. The pronounced decrease of surface area is likely to be due to the pore blocking of the Mo species. Thus, the thiophene conversion was decreased as the molybdenum loading increased. 4. Conclusions The Mo/A120catalyst was prepared by adding Mo-acac to the alumina so] obtained by the Yoldas procedure [ 11,12 ] and characterized with z' Al NMR, XRD, TEM, and the thiophene HDS reaction.

The structural evolution of Mo Al2O3 gel was investigated by using 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). 27Al NMR of Mo Al2O3 has been compared with that of pure alumina. The addition of molybdenum species to alumina sol was to have no effect on the alumina structure when the molybdenum loading was lower than 20%. No incorporation of molybdenum species to alumina lattice was observed and the finely dispersed MoS2 crystallite on the support was obtained upon sulfidation. However, an Al2(MoO4)3 phase, which was an indication of the interaction between Al2O3 and MoO3, was formed on the alumina surface when molybdenum loading was higher than 20%. All molybdenum species were accessible by reactant molecules regardless of molybdenum loading. Keywords 27Al NMR Sol-gel Hydrodesulfurization Alumina Molybdenum Aluminum molybdate References [1] C.J.
