The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added products is a significant emission reduction method. Among numerous catalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential in CO2 hydrogenation. However, it is difficult to predict the CO2 hydrogenation products because the SACs consisting of the same metal and different supports commonly show various catalytic selectivity. Here we study the catalytic mechanism of the CO2 hydrogenation process catalyzed by the SAC with 3d transition metals. The metal atoms are anchored on the covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). We find the correlation between adsorption configuration and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation. The coadsorption configuration of the H atom and CO2 molecule is favorable to forming the CH bond in formate. A volcano relation based on activation barrier and 3d-orbital electron numbers was obtained. We found that the catalyst with Ni metal has the lowest activation barrier. We also explained the low catalytic activity of Sc, Ti, and V metals due to the inert intermediates occupying the active sites. This work may be helpful to design highly selective and highly active catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation.

The conversion of CO2 into carbon chemicals or carbon-neutral fuels is the laurel wreath in carbon and energy circulation. The technology not only mitigates the concentration of CO2 but also reduces the use of fossil fuels. Among many catalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential in CO2 hydrogenation [3]. The high mass activity, unique selectivity, and easily adjustable configuration make SAC an excellent catalyst in heterogeneous reactions [4,5]. So far, many SACs have shown high activity in CO2 activation and reduction, such as the single-atom Ru catalyst on the surface of a layered double hydroxide [6], the single-atom Re on the organosilica nanotubes [7], and the metal-bipyridine complexes [8]. In the periodic table, the 3d transition metals, which are abundant and low-cost compared to the rare metals, have great potential in industrial catalysis [9,10]. Therefore, it is significant to explore the most active transition metal catalysts for the CO2 hydrogenation. Besides the intrinsic property of the metal single-atom, the support also has a significant impact on the catalytic activity [11]. A covalent triazine framework (CTF), consisting of nitrogen-rich aromatic rings as the linking units, has been widely used in heterogeneous catalysis [12]. It shows excellent potential in CO2 catalytic conversion [13,14], due to the high stability, the large pore volume, and the high specific surface area. CTFs have numerous separated nitrogen atoms, which behave as the stably anchoring sites using for the depositions of metal atoms. Many works reported that the CTFs loaded with noble metals are highly active for the CO2 catalytic conversion [5,15]. Based on the above understandings, the 3d-metal SACs supported on CTFs may be useful in CO2 hydrogenation. Many theoretical investigations have elucidated the single-atom catalytic mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation. In these works, the generally accepted pathways are that CO2 is reduced to carbon monoxide (CO) or formic acid [16]. Furthermore, which route the reaction experience commonly depends on the first hydrogenation process [17,18]. The formate intermediate tends to produce formic acid, while the carboxyl species are prone to convert into CO [19–23]. Then, the hydrogenation intermediates may either desorb [24,25] or further be hydrogenated to methanol [26–28], methane [29,30], ethanol [31,32], ethylene [33], ethane [30]. The diversity of products makes it complicated to understand the catalytic mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation using SAC. We found the coadsorption structure of the hydrogen atom and CO2 molecule on the metal of SAC is vital to further hydrogenation. However, there are only a few theoretical investigations available to elucidate the interaction between adsorbates and metal active sites. Therefore, it is essential to figure out the effect caused by different metals, especially 3d transition metals, on the first hydrogenation step. In this work, we theoretically investigated SACs of 3d transition metals and their essential mechanism for the activity and selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. Firstly, we constructed a series of SAC models, in which the 3d-transition-metal atoms were anchored on the CTFs support. We theoretically studied the adsorption configurations of H2, H atom, CO2, and the coadsorption of H atom and CO2 molecule on the metal active sites. Then, the H2 dissociation reaction and the first step of the CO2 hydrogenation were calculated. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanistic insights into the formate and the carboxyl routes. 2 Computational details Considering the computing costs for a macromolecule, we used (2-pyridyl)-s-triazine as the simplified unit model of the CTF [21], as displayed in Fig. 1 . The metal atom (M) bonds to the unit model through the nitrogen atoms, respectively, from the pyridine and the triazine moieties. Since this unit is part of 2,5-DCP-CTF, we marked the unit model and its metal complex as P-2,5-DCP-CTF and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), respectively. The unit model keeps the active metal sites and the supporting ligands, with less computing costs. We have analyzed the rationality of the model simplification in the supporting information (SI). To investigate the processes of the CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation, we performed DFT calculations through Gaussian 16 software [34]. Because M06l functional has been proved acceptable to the 3d transition metals with appropriate dispersion correction [35–37], we used M06l functional in the entire computation process. The calculations were carried out using the 6–311G(d,p) basis set for non-metallic elements and the SDD basis set for metals [38–40]. The metal elements were augmented with the corresponding SDD pseudo-potential. All possible spin multiplicities were considered in the geometry optimizations to find the lowest-energy structure. Vibrational frequencies of the optimized configurations were analyzed to validate that the optimized geometries correspond to the local minima or transition states (TS). Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) [41] calculations have been performed to corroborate that the TS connects the reactant and product. Charge analyses were performed through the Mulliken charge method [42]. Electron localization function (ELF) [43] was calculated through the Multiwfn software[44] to display the electron interaction between the metal atom and the CO2 molecule. The analyses of the density of state (DOS), including partial DOS (PDOS), total DOS (TDOS), and overlap population DOS (OPDOS), were used to explore the interaction within M-H bonds [44,45]. All the simulations were accomplished in the gas phase. Adsorption energy (Ead) is defined as the following equation, (1) E ad · = · E int · − · E · · − · E int where E*int, E*, and Eint are the total electronic energy of adsorbent with adsorbate, bare adsorbent, and adsorbate molecule in the gas phase, respectively. For convenience, the adsorption energy of the H atom on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M is called Ead-1-H, and the adsorption energy on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2 is called Ead-2-H. Similarly, the adsorption energy of the CO2 molecule on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M is called Ead-1-CO2, and the adsorption energy on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H is called Ead-2-CO2. The following expression calculates the formation energy of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M: (2) E form · = · E P − 2 , 5 − DCP − CTF − M · − · E P − 2 , 5 − DCP − CTF · − · E M where E P − 2 , 5 − DCP − CTF − M , · E P − 2 , 5 − DCP − CTF , · E M is the energy of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M, P-2,5-DCP-CTF, and a single metal atom, respectively. 3 Results 3.1 P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M activation Firstly, the geometry optimizations of P-2,5-DCP-CTF and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were carried out. The formation energies of metals on the P-2,5-DCP-CTF support were subsequently calculated. These results are listed in Table S1 of the SI. The formation energies of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc, P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti, and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-V are higher than −60 kcal/mol, and other P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) still have energies up to −35 kcal/mol. It indicates that these eight metal atoms could be stably anchored on the nitrogen sites of P-2,5-DCP-CTF at room temperature. On the contrary, the formation energy of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Mn is −22.94 kcal/mol, which is lower than the above eight metals. For P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Zn, the Zn atom leaves away from the nitrogen coordination sites of P-2,5-DCP-CTF. The weak coordination interaction of nitrogen to Mn and Zn may be due to their half- and full-filled 3d-orbitals, respectively. Therefore, the following theoretical investigations did not consider P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Zn any longer. Besides, the optimization results show that the spin multiplicity of the most stable configuration is consistent with the number of single electrons in the 3d-orbitals of the pure metallic element (Table S2). H2 dissociation on the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M was calculated, and the detailed analyses are listed in Table S3 and Table S4. It shows that the H2 could be dissociated on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M in mild conditions with the barrier energies less than 18 kcal/mol, except Cu. Thermodynamically, the hydrogen atoms formed from H2 dissociation could migrate spontaneously on the support surface, that is, the so-called hydrogen ‘spillover’ process. [46–49] It has been reported that the spillover of H atoms from the metal onto the carbon support is possible [50]. Thus, the configuration of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M bonding with one hydrogen atom is feasible, named P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H. Owing to the disorder and porous structure of CTFs, the H atom could be adsorbed on the metal active site in all directions. The optimization result of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H shows that the complex of a hydrogen atom and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M (M=Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) conforms to a flat geometry. For Sc, V, and Co, the hydrogen atom was adsorbed to the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M from the top. The information of atomic charges and adsorption energies of hydrogen of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H is shown in Table S5. CO2 is thermodynamically stable with linear geometry. At the initial stage of the reaction, the activation of CO2 is necessary for further reaction. Generally, a CO2 molecule has four different adsorption models on metal active sites [1,5,51]. Moreover, CTFs with porous and disorder structures allow a CO2 molecule to interact with the metal atom in all directions. It means that there are several possible adsorption geometries in our work. As shown in Fig. 2 , either only C or O atoms or both of C and O or two O atoms of CO2 could be adsorbed on the metal atom to form *COO, *OCO, O*CO, and O*OC configurations, respectively. Besides, the \"f\" is used to indicate that the adsorbate was adsorbed from the front to the adsorbent to form a planar configuration, while \"s\" means that the adsorbent was adsorbed to the adsorbent from the side to form a stereo configuration. The side may be above or below. The optimization results show that *OCO configuration is unstable and transforms to other geometries. For all P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2 of nine 3d transition metals, the optimized geometries and their bond parameters of CO2 are listed in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . The optimization results show that CO2 is activated by chemisorption on the nine 3d transition metal atoms. The CO2 adopts an O*OC configuration on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti, whereby the OCO bond angle reduces to less than 120°, and both two CO bonds reach a length of 1.35 Å. For the adsorption configurations on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), C and O atoms of CO2 both interact with the metal atom to form an O*CO structure. The OC-O bond angle bends to about 140°, and the bond length of adsorbed C and O atoms (CO1) is about ten percent longer than its linear form (1.16 Å). P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cu adsorbs CO2 in *COO configuration. The OC-O bond angle is 155°, and the two CO bonds length is 1.22 Å and 1.18 Å, respectively. Besides, the charge information in Table 1 shows that electrons transfer from P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M surface to adsorbed CO2 moiety. The charge transfer decreases against the electron number in the 3d-orbit of the metal. The charge of CO2 adsorbed on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cu is the lowest at only 0.02 e. Besides, as listed in Table 1, the CO2 adsorption energies on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti are up to −44.96 kcal/mol and −40.55 kcal/mol, respectively. For V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, the adsorption energies of CO2 on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M are also higher than −20 kcal/mol. The CO2 adsorption energy on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cu is the lowest at −12.73 kcal/mol. This indicates that each P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M could adsorb CO2 well. In our simulation, the initial state (IS) of CO2 hydrogenation is the coadsorption configuration of CO2 and H atom on the active metal site, namely P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2. Different kinds of coadsorption geometries were considered for each metal. For Sc, Ti, V atoms, the adsorption structure is that C and O atoms of CO2 molecule were coadsorbed on the metal atom from the upside and the atomic hydrogen from the bottom (s-O*CO, s-*H). The CO2 is fully activated that their CO bond length (1.29 Å, 1.35 Å, 1.32 Å, respectively) are about 10% longer than the CO bond length of CO2 in the gas phase, and the OC-O bond angle bends to about 130° The Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni atoms all interact with the O atom of CO2 from the upside and the atomic hydrogen from the front (s-*OCO, f-*H). The CO2 is almost linear, with an unchanged CO bond length (1.17 Å) . It falls in between the previous two kinds of adsorption geometries that Cr atom couples to atomic hydrogen and one O atom of CO2 from the front in a flat-square geometry (f-*OCO, f-*H). CO2 is slightly activated that the OC-O bond angle bends to 170.7°, and the CO1 bond length is 1.18 Å. Unlike those, CO2 is physically adsorbed on the Cu atom with a Cu-O bond longer than 3 Å. Compared with P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2, the existence of coadsorbed H weakens the interaction between CO2 and metal atoms. The negative charge of CO2 on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2 is reduced relative to that on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2. For instance, the negative charges of CO2 on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc-H-CO2 and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti-H-CO2 are 0.76 e and 0.67 e respectively, and those on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc-CO2 and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti-CO2 are reduced to 0.49 e and 0.55 e. Moreover, the CO2 moieties in P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) are slightly positively charged (0.01 ~ 0.06 |e|) due to the electrons transfer to P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H moiety. For the adsorption energy of CO2 that is listed in Table 1, the energy on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H significantly decreases compared to the value on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M. The adsorption energy of CO2 on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti is the highest at −37 kcal/mol. For Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, the adsorption energies of CO2 on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H are less than −6 kcal/mol. For both P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H, the adsorption energy of CO2 on Cu is the lowest. The binding energy of Cu-O in P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cu-H-CO2 is −4.27 kcal/mol. These results indicate that although CO2 is repelled by a coadsorbed hydrogen atom, it can still be adsorbed on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H. In the same way, as shown in Table S5, the M-H binding energy of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2 significantly reduced compared with P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-H, indicating that the adsorption of CO2 weakens the interaction between the metal atom and hydrogen. The adsorption energy of hydrogen atom on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-CO2 is the lowest at −45.42 kcal/mol. 3.2 CO2 hydrogenation Based on the geometrical studies of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2, we further studied the hydrogenation processes. Two possible pathways in the first step of CO2 hydrogenation were theoretically investigated. One pathway is the formation of formate intermediate (*OCHO), following the transfer of hydrogen atom from the metal atom to the C atom of the CO2 molecule. On the other pathway, the hydrogen atom transfers to the O atom to form carboxyl (*COOH) species. In the formate pathway, all the formate species tend to form *OCHO structure on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M, except on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Mn that the formate directly transforms to O*OCH (Figure S1). In the carboxyl pathway, there are three different reaction routes, which are divided by the differences in adsorption geometric structures and reaction intermediates. For Sc, Ti, and V atoms, the adsorbed CO2 tends to be dissociated to *CO and *O species. Then the *O species is hydrogenated to *OH. There is no *COOH intermediate during this route. For Cr and Mn atoms, CO2 is also dissociated, but hydrogenated to *CO and *OH product at the same time. The Co, Ni, and Cu atoms catalyzed the CO2 hydrogenation to *COOH product at first. However, only the Co atom can further dissociate *COOH intermediate to *CO and *OH species, while Cu and Ni cannot break the CO bond. Interestingly, Fe is on the transition region of two routes, it could either hydrogenate CO2 to *CO and *OH directly or to *COOH species at first. The reaction energies of different CO2 hydrogenation routes, with the IS, TS, and final states (FS) structures in the respective reactions, on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc, P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cr, and P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni are shown in Fig. 3 . Further details about the reaction energies in the formate pathway and carboxyl pathway on other metal catalysts are listed in Table S7 and Table S8, respectively. Take Sc as an example (Fig. 3A), for the pathway of CO2 hydrogenation on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2 of Sc, Ti, and V, the barrier energy of the CO bond scission is lower than the one in the formate pathway. The barrier energy of CO2 dissociation on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ti-H-CO2 is 15.28 kcal/mol lower than the one of the formate pathway. However, although the further hydrogenation of *O intermediate is exothermic, the barrier energy is too high to react further. P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Sc-H-CO2 has the lowest barrier energy (30.57 kcal/mol) for *O hydrogenation among these three metals. The *CO and *O intermediates would occupy the active catalytic site as inert intermediate to stop the next reaction. Therefore, Sc, Ti, and V are inactive in CO2 hydrogenation. For Cr, Mn, Fe atoms, the barrier energies in the carboxyl pathway are much higher than those in the formate pathway. Even the lowest barrier energy in the carboxyl pathway is up to 44.35 kcal/mol, which is on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Mn-H-CO2. While for Cr and Fe, the barrier energies are higher than 50 kcal/mol. The high barrier of the carboxyl pathway could be ascribed to the simultaneous process of dissociation and hydrogenation of CO2 without any intermediate. The barrier energy of the formate pathway on these three metals is less than 9 kcal/mol. Besides, as shown in Fig. 3B, in the formate pathway for P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cr, CO2 is hydrogenated to *OCHO through two steps. There is a stable intermediate on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Cr. The barrier energy of the first step is nearly zero, and that of the second step is also lower than the barrier energy in the formate pathway on Mn and Fe. For Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, the formate pathway is the dominant pathway with lower barrier energies compared with the carboxyl pathway (Fig. 3C). Although the further dissociation of *COOH species in the carboxyl pathway of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Co has low barrier energy of 7.57 kcal/mol, the *COOH intermediate is hard to produce. The barrier energies of the formate pathways on these metals are less than 11 kcal/mol, while those of the carboxyl pathways are greater than 35 kcal/mol. P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2 has the lowest barrier energies (6.20 kcal/mol and 35.33 kcal/mol) in both paths of formate and carboxyl. Besides, we found that P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni has another coadsorption configuration. For this configuration, the C atom of CO2 and hydrogen atom both bond to the Ni atom from the front (f-*COO, f-*H). We named it P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2. The configuration of the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2 is the most stable coadsorption geometry discussed above (s-*OCO, f-*H). P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2 has slightly higher energy than P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2. Both of these configurations could be hydrogenated to formate. The ELF in Fig. 4 shows that the electron interaction of CO2 to DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2 is stronger than to DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2, indicating that the CO2 on DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2 has a higher degree of activation. Therefore, the barrier energy of CO2 to formate on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2 (6.20 kcal/mol) is higher than that on DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2 (0.14 kcal/mol). In the carboxyl pathway, the hydrogenation starts from the DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2–2 structure. Thus the barrier energy is low. 4 Discussion To explore the highest catalytic activity of the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M catalyst, we established the curve of the barrier energy of the first hydrogenation step of the formic acid pathway as a function of 3d-orbital electron number. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the metal atoms were divided into two regions according to the number of 3d-orbital electrons. Sc, Ti, and V atoms with less than four 3d-orbital electrons were divided in the left region (orange). The metal atoms, including Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, having more than four 3d-orbital electrons were divided in the right region (blue). The regularities of distribution could be attributed to the different adsorption geometries. There is a ‘volcano’ curve in the right part with Ni located at the summit with the lowest barrier energy. Thus, P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni has the highest catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenated to formate among the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M. The Mulliken charge in CO2 hydrogenation to formate route, with IS, TS, and FS in the respective reactions, are summarized in Table S6. Moreover, the change in charge from IS to TS on adsorbed CO2 moiety was also calculated, which also established a volcano-shaped relationship against the 3d-orbital electron number on the right part (Fig. 5C). This plot agrees well with the ‘volcano’ curve of barrier energy and confirms that the barrier energy is positively correlated to the electron transfer. Besides, the adsorption energy of hydrogen atom on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2 in Fig. 5A is positively correlated with the barrier energy of CO2 hydrogenation, that the highest and lowest adsorption energies of H atom are respectively on Ti and Ni. The low binding energy of the M-H bond is favorable for the hydrogen atom to break bonds with metal and migrate to CO2. In summary, the activity of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is related to the binding energy of M-H. The binding energy of Ni-H of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2 is the lowest; therefore, P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni has the highest hydrogenation activity of CO2. To get insights into the correlation between the adsorption configurations and the intrinsic properties of the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M, we analyzed the highest occupied molecule orbits (HOMO) of Ti in various configurations (Figure S6) and the DOS of the adsorption structure of Ti, Cr, and Ni (Fig. 6 ). The difference in adsorption configurations could be attributed to the d-orbital electron number of metals. It is well known that the transition metals could provide remaining empty d-orbits as an electrophile to accept electrons to form a coordination bond or provide alone electrons acting as a nucleophile to form a covalent bond. [11] The atomic hydrogen interacts with the metal atom through the latter way. At the same time, the adsorption of CO2 needs empty d-orbits of the metal atom. We can reasonably conclude from the profile that Sc, Ti, and V atoms have more than two empty d-orbits. Thus these three metals tend to adsorb CO2 through the coadsorption of C and O atoms. However, the Cr atom with only one empty d-orbit bonds to an O atom of CO2. For metals that have more d-orbital electrons than Cr, their interaction with CO2 is weak because they cannot provide the empty d-orbit. Thus, the metals with enough empty d-orbits show relatively strong bonding strength with CO2 molecule and are conducive to CO2 activation. Besides, the interaction with atomic hydrogen increases the valence of metal, which makes it more difficult to interact with the C atom. The DOS in Fig. 6 demonstrates that the electron interactions between H and Ti, Cr, and Ni are mainly from the interaction of the dz 2 orbits of the metal atom and the s orbit of the hydrogen atom. The OPDOS moves to the right with the d-orbital electron number. The OPDOS of Ti and H, and Cr and H are all located in occupied orbits, while part of the OPDOS of Ni and H atom is located in unoccupied orbitals. This results in a weak Ni-H bond. In the first hydrogenation step, the formate pathway is more competitive than the carboxyl pathway in terms of barrier energy on all the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M except Sc, Ti, and V. Thus, P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu all have a unique selectivity for CO2 hydrogenated to formate. And they are supposed to be further hydrogenated to formic acid instead of CO. This result is in accordance with some experimental results, such as CoOx/ZrO2-graphite [52], nano-scale zero-valent nickel [53], reported previously. However, some reports present that CO2 hydrogenated to CO on Pyridinium-Co [54], Co-salophen, and Co-salen [55,56]. Unlike the electro-catalytic reduction in which H cation is transferred directly from the solution, in thermal catalysis, atomic H is transferred to the adsorbed CO2 from the catalyst surface. Therefore, it is the coadsorption configuration of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-HCO2 that makes the formate pathway more favorable. For SACs integrated into a flat surface, the hydrogen atom and CO2 molecule are supposed to couple to metal atom from the upside and interact with the z-component of the d-orbit. The repulsive interaction makes the two adsorbates difficult to coadsorb. The P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M allows hydrogen and CO2 to interact with the metal atom either from upside or front or both with little repulsion, which is beneficial to coadsorption. In the coadsorption configuration, on the one hand, the distance between hydrogen and C atom of CO2 is relatively short, on the other hand, the hydrogen atom is negatively charged, that both are favorable for the hydrogen transferring to the C atom. This point is consistent with the experimental results on the SAC of Ir atom that dispersed on CTFs [15] and other unsaturated coordination SACs [57]. 5 Conclusion A systematic DFT study was performed on nine P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M catalysts to explore their potential in applications of chemical CO2 recycling via hydrogenation reaction. Configuration study of the hydrogen atom and CO2 molecule on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M shows that the adsorbed hydrogen and CO2 repel each other. The porosity structure of CTFs reduces the repulsion and favors coadsorption. For the P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M of metals with empty 3d-orbits less than 2, it is the coadsorption configuration that leads to a unique selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation that produces formate instead of carboxyl species. A ‘volcano’ plot about barrier energy in the formate pathway is established with Ni located at the summit with the lowest barrier energy. Moreover, the barrier energy is corresponding to the adsorption energy of the H atom on P-2,5-DCP-CTF-M-CO2, indicating the low M-H binding energy is favorable to the migration of hydrogen atom from metal to CO2. The low Ni-H binding energy of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni-H-CO2 is due to that part of the OPDOS between the H and Ni atom is in the non-occupied orbital region. As to Sc, Ti, and V atoms, CO2 activation and dissociation are favorable. The *CO, and *O species are easy to generate but neither to be hydrogenated nor desorbed. The inert intermediates would block the active metal sites and suppress their activity. That could be the reason why Sc, Ti, V atoms are inactive in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. In summary, this work found the great potential of P-2,5-DCP-CTF-Ni in catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formate and elucidated the mechanism of its high activity. It illustrated the importance of adsorption geometry on catalytic selectivity. Steric hindrance of support and the number of empty orbits of metals should be considered in SAC design.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added products is a significant emission reduction method. Among numerous catalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) show great potential in CO2 hydrogenation. However, it is difficult to predict the CO2 hydrogenation products because the SACs consisting of the same metal and different supports commonly show various catalytic selectivity. Here we study the catalytic mechanism of the CO2 hydrogenation process catalyzed by the SAC with 3d transition metals. The metal atoms are anchored on the covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). We find the correlation between adsorption configuration and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation. The coadsorption configuration of the H atom and CO2 molecule is favorable to forming the CH bond in formate. A volcano relation based on activation barrier and 3d-orbital electron numbers was obtained. We found that the catalyst with Ni metal has the lowest activation barrier. We also explained the low catalytic activity of Sc, Ti, and V metals due to the inert intermediates occupying the active sites. This work may be helpful to design highly selective and highly active catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation.",
