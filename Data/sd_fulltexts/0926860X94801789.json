(+39-9O 1011 Received 24 December 1993; revised 18 March 1994; accepted 21 March 1994 Abstract The influence of surface acid-base properties on the formation of a dispersed platinum phase on a carbon support was studied by various physico-chemical techniques, i.e., tentiometric titration (ZPC), FT-IR, TPD and XPS. The series of events occurring during thermal activation of Pt/C catalysts was investigated and the results were related to the electrochemical active surface area (MSA) determined by cyclic voltammetry in phosphoric acid. The results suggest that surface acidic oxygen-containing functional groups may act as anchoring centres for the metal particles limiting their growth in the low-temperature range. This effect produces a strong metal-support interaction which affects the electronic nature of platinum sites. In the high-temperature range, basic functional groups are mainly individuated, i.e., Ca- and pyrone-type sites. Pyrone groups behave similarly to the acidic groups whereas Cir groups possess an electron-releasing behaviour producing a lower level of metal-support interaction.

Introduction In the last few years renewed interest has been shown in catalysts for phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) [ 1-3 ] . The variation of specific (A CM-2 ) and mass activity (A g-') for Pt/C catalysts as a function of the metal surface area has been investigated [ 1-3 ] . In addition, the level of metal-support interaction is considered an important parameter controlling the kinetics of 02 reduction [4] as it may affect the Pt surface area and the Pt co-ordination to functional groups on the capon surface [ 5 ] . Reinoso et al. [ 6 ] observed that both the surface oxygen groups and the pore structure have an influence on the dispersion of Pt on capon. This analysis was concerned with low Pt loading (1 % Pt) catalysts that are of limited interest 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved CCTllnn')G ocnv inANnnn~n o 258 T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 for applications in phosphoric acid fuel cells. In the present study the relationships between metal-surface area of Pt and acid-base surface properties, determined by both surface functional groups and zero point of charge (ZPC), are investigated. The application of ZPC measurements to investigate Pt/C electrocatalysts was described by Aric et al. [ 7 ] . This earlier study revealed the strong influence of heat-treatment temperature, Pt loading and exposure time to air on the formation of acid and basic functional groups on carbon. In the present study the surface properties together with the preparation procedures are further investigated by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to assess the influence of acid-base characteristics on the formation of a dispersed Pt phase on the carbon support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of platinized carbons The catalysts, consisting of Pt supported on carbon black (Ketjenblack), were prepared by liquid-phase reduction of H2PtCl6 (Engelhard industries). The Ketjenblack carbon (Akzo Chemie) has BET surface area of 900 m2 g-', a surface graphiticity index value of 43 X 10-3 Jb m-2 and a surface polarity index value of 0.8 X 10 - 3 Jp m- 2 [ 8 ] . Furthermore, it has a pHvc of 9.85 bearing a positive charge at low pH [ 9 ] . Carbon samples with 14-20 wt.-% Pt loading were prepared by the following three procedures: (A) 1 g platinum equivalent chloroplatinic acid was dissolved in 50 ml of water and the temperature of this solution was raised to 60 C. 50 ml of an aqueous solution of Na2S204 (30 g/1) was slowly added to the warm chloroplatinic solution with continuous stirring and about 4 ml of 30% H202 was added to stabilize the colloidal Pt in solution. A homogeneous slurry of carbon ( 5 g) in ethanol and water was added to the colloidal dispersion under constant stirring over a period of 3 h. The platinized carbon that formed was then separated from the aqueous solution by filtering, and then it was washed with water and dried overnight at 110 C in air. (B) A solution of 1 g platinum equivalent chloroplatinic acid in 50 ml of water was added to a suspension of 5 g of carbon in 250 ml of water and 2.5 ml of ethanol, followed by addition of 4 ml of 30% H202. The resulting suspension was heated to 45 C with constant stirring for a period of 30 min and 20 ml of an aqueous solution of Na2S204 (30 g/1) was then slowly added. The platinized carbon was separated, washed and dried at 110 C in air. (C) 1 g platinum equivalent chloroplatinic acid in 50 ml water was slowly added to a suspension of 5 g carbon stirred in 250 ml water for 30 min and heated at 80 C. The resulting mass was allowed to settle for 2 h and a slight excess of 0.1 M Na2S203 was then slowly added over a period of 1 h while maintaining the tem- T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 259 perature at 80 C and adjusting the pH to about 7. The platinized carbon was separated, washed and dried overnight at 70 C in air. Thermal activation of the catalysts prepared by all the above methods was performed in a quartz tube furnace under flowing nitrogen atmosphere at 200900 C for times ranging from 45 min to 4 h. Pt loading was determined by a spectrophotometric tin(II) method [ 10]. The Pt/C catalyst (2 g) was calcined in an air furnace at 1100 C for 1 h. Pt residue was treated with 1:3 aqua regia (10 ml) and thereafter with HCI. An aliquot of the diluted Pt solution was mixed with 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%) and 10 ml of tin (II) chloride solution (1 M SnCIZ and 3.5 M HCl). The spectrum of the Pt-Sn complex was obtained on a Hitachi U-3410 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The absorbance was measured at 403 nm. Relative error was less than 1 % in the concentration range between 3 and 25 ppm Pt. 2.2. ZPC measurements A potentiometric technique was used to determine the of the Pt/C catalysts in a Pyrex glass cell. The samples were dispersed in an aqueous solution (500 ml), containing 0.1 M KN03 supporting electrolyte, to form a suspension. The glass cell has provision for a glass electrode to measure the pH of the solutions and a probe to monitor and control the temperature (ATC). The cell is covered with a PTFE cap which has a gas inlet to purge the solution with nitrogen. Measurements in solutions of different KN03 electrolyte concentrations (0.01, 0.001) gave reproducible values. A 0.1 M KOH solution (5-20 ml) was added to the catalysts suspension. The titrant (0.1 M HN03) was added incrementally, and the pH was recorded after reaching the steady-state for 3 min. The inflection points, slopes and heights of the pH variation were used to determine the amounts (Ca or Cb) and strengths (pKa or pKb) of acidic and basic functional groups. The pH,,,, values were determined by the extra adsorption functions or the adsorption densities obtained numerically by a Costech International Win ZPC' software following the procedure due to Parks and de Bruyn [ 11 ] . ZPC is extrapolated at the pH at which no net adsorption of OH- or H+ occurs on the carbon black (i.e., IIDH-III+ = 0, where T is the adsorption density in fAmol g-1) . Further details of this technique are described by Aricb et al. [ 7,9 ] and Parks and de Bruyn [ 11 ] . 2.3. Physico-chemical characterization of platinized carbons 2.3.1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) The Pt surface area was determined by conventional cyclic voltammetry using the coulombic charge for hydrogen adsorption in the potential range from 0.05 to 0.4 V (vs. RHE) in 50% H3P04 at room temperature. The area was derived by considering that the charge passed in the reversible hydrogen adsorption-desorption process involved 210 E.cC per one square centimetre of real Pt surface and after 260 T. Torre et al. l Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 correction of data for the double layer charging. The catalysts were assembled into flooded electrode structures consisting of the Pt/C electrocatalyst and a small amount of PTFE (10%) which is necessary to maintain the electrode structure. 2.3.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) The XPS measurements were performed using a VSW Scientific Instruments (Manchester, UK); X-ray source was Mg Ka at a power of 150 W. Spectra were obtained with pass energy of 90 eV for wide scans and 44 eV per individual elements. The pressure in the base chamber of the spectrometer was 5 X 10-' mbar (Ti sublimation pump) and 5 X 10-9 mbar during the measurements. The XPS samples were prepared by coating catalysts on sample holders (stainless steel 304), and drying at 100 C in a low-pressure (0.1 atm) oven for 1 h. The samples were introduced into the spectrometer using a separate differentially pumped fast entry chamber, then into a desorption chamber in a ultra-high vacuum for desorption of highly volatile species adsorbed on a carbon support, and finally into the analyzer chamber. The Pt 4fa2 and 4f5,2 peaks of a Pt foil were all taken, after argon sputtering, before the sample observation for calibration of the spectrometer. The background correction was performed by the Shirley method [ 12] and curve fitting by Gauss-Lorentz routines. The quantitative evaluation of each peak was obtained by dividing the integrated peak area by atomic sensitivity factors which were calculated from the ionization cross-sections, the mean free electron escape depth and the measured transmission functions of the spectrometer expressed as the relative intensity ratio to carbon [ 13,14]. 2.3.3. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) FT-IR spectra of Ketjenblack and Pt-loaded carbons were collected in the 370 cm-'-4000 cm' range. Dispersions of carbon samples were obtained by homogenization of 15 mg of sample with KBr (analytical grade) in an agate mortar for 15 min; after drying further dilution to 0.5% (wt./wt.) with KBr was made with additional grinding (1 h in a vibratory mill). Disks (0.2 mm thick) were obtained by pressing the sample dispersions in a vacuum KBr press at 10 tons for 5 min. Before each series of scans, disks were dried at 120 C for 2 h until no perceptible variation in the characteristic absorption band near 3400-3600 cm-' was observed with drying time. To eliminate the contribution of H20 and C02 from the air, the equipment was purged during the time of scanning with 30 cm'/min of helium flux. 2.3.4. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) TPD measurements were performed in a conventional flow apparatus using a linear quartz gradientless microreactor (I.D. = 4 mm; length = 200 mm) and He as carrier gas flowing at 30 STP cm3 min'. All the experiments were carried out from 100 to 900 C with a heating rate of 15 C min-'. The desorption processes of gaseous species from the sample (ca. 0.1 g) were monitored by a thermolab T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 261 quadrupole mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments) connected on-line with a reactor. Mass spectra were recorded in multiple ion monitoring (MIM) mode using the SEM amplifier operating at 1000 V (total pressure 2 . 10-9 bar) and an ionization potential of - 70 V. TPD spectra were obtained by acquiring the signals relative to the following m/z values: 18 (H20); 28 (CO); 32 (OZ); 44 (COD; 64 (SOZ); 71 (C12). CH4 was revealed by the CH3 (m/z, 15) signal. 2.3.5. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Transmission electron microscopy was performed using a STEM apparatus (Philips CX20) whose ultimate spatial resolution was 0.5 nm. To allow a uniform distribution of the grains of the carbon support, the catalytic layer was first dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and then deposited and dried on a TEM support comprising a Cu grid covered with a carbon film of a few tens of nanometers in thickness. 3. Results and discussion It has been reported [15,16] that metal adsorption and dispersion on carbon supports can be influenced by acid-base properties of the material and the pH of the catalyst precursor solution. The surface charge density on Pt-loaded carbons is determined by the acid-base behaviour of the adsorption sites which are present on the carbon surface [ 7,9 ] . Reactive sites at the edges of basal plane structures give rise to the formation of strongly bound oxygen [ 17,18 ] and Cir ligand complexes [ 19] which may hinder Pt cluster diffusion during the particle growth process [ 16 ] , hence enhancing the metal dispersion. Three preparation methods for Pt/C catalysts have been investigated. Method \"A\" concerns the adsorption of colloidal Pt on the carbon support. Both H202, added to stabilize the colloid, and HCl, originated from decomposition of HZPtcl precursor, react with the carbon black changing its surface characteristics. In the method \"B\" the H2PtC16 is first adsorbed on the carbon support, then it is \"in situ\" reduced to metallic Pt; furthermore the H202 added to the solution can react with the carbon surface. Method \"C\" is characterized by the \"in situ \" Pt reduction without any further interaction of the carbon with H202. The liquid phase preparation processes and the carbon support decomposition during the thermal treatment (loss of volatile species up to 20% wt./ wt.), produce Pt loadings in the catalysts that are different from the nominal amounts. No clear correlation was found between the surface acid-base characteristics and the Pt loading in the investigated range. It appears that the effect of Pt loading is largely exceeded by the effects of activation temperature and preparation procedure. The acid-base properties and the metallic surface area of Pt/C samples, prepared according to the procedures above described and activated at various temperature levels, are reported in Table 1. It is observed that the surface characteristics vary especially with the level of thermal activation; furthermore, they are also influenced 262 T.

The catalysts show increasing basic properties with an increase of the level of thermal activation. In general it is observed that the preparation procedures \"A\" and \"C\" produce slightly more acidic catalysts with respect to the \"B\" method. In the \"A\" method the combined effect of HCl originated from the previous decomposition of the Pt precursor, and H202 produces an enhancement of the acidic characteristics with respect to the method ` `B\" (see Table 1) . Probably, in the procedure \"B\", reactive carbon sites adsorb prevailingly H2PtC16. The catalyst prepared in the absence of H202 (method C ) and activated at low temperature showed similar acidic properties to the corresponding sample obtained with the method \"B\". This accounts for the prevailing effect determined by H2PtCl6 on the acid-base properties in the \"in situ\" reduction methods. Fig. 1 shows the variation of adsorption density for a few typical thermally activated platinized carbon catalysts as a function of the pH. The pHZ~ defines the acid-base properties of the catalysts which depend on the strength and amount of surface functional groups present on the carbon support. Yet, as the acid-base strength of the functional groups varies only slightly for catalysts activated at medium-high temperature, being about pKa = 5-6.4 for acidic groups and T.

[20] and a high surface graphiticity index (SGI=43.1 ~ 10-3 Jb/m2) [8]. The presence of such basic sites could play an important role in the adsorption of HZPtCI by undergoing a strong interaction with it. On the other hand the reaction of the carbon surface with H3 +O ions coming from the dissociation of the Pt precursor determines a sensible modification (increased acidity) of the KB. Fig. 3 shows the variation of surface acid-base properties of various Pt/C catalysts, reflected by the pHZpc, as a function of the activation temperature in the range from 200 C to 900 C. It is observed that two different processes determine the surface properties of Pt/C catalysts. According to the premises, the first process arises from the reaction of carbon with H2PtC16 or HCl originating from the decomposition of the Pt precursor and H202 depending on the preparation. These reactions cause an increase in the concentration of acidic sites which are likely to be enriched with oxygen-containing surface groups. Evidence of the formation of carboxylic acids, lactone, phenol and carbonyl groups on carbon upon acidic treatment with HN03 has been given by Papirer et al. [ 18 ] . Formation of similar surface groups, at low temperatures, probably occurs in our preparation procedure; in fact HZPtC16 as well as H202 can be considered as strong oxidizing agents. In the method \"A\" the oxidation of carbon surface occurs due to the combined effect of H202 and HCI originating from the precursor. These conjectures are strengthened by the observation of strong acidic dissociation constants monitored in the samples treated at low temperature ( samples 2-4 in Table 1) . The treatment at high temperatures causes the onset of a second process that progressively clears the surface from the acidic oxygen-containing groups [ 18 ] , leaving a greater number of basic sites (Table 1). The basicity is probably due to the presence of C sites, i.e., it arises from the Lewis base behaviour of the graphitic basal plane [ 19] . T.

As stated by B oehm [ 17 ] and Papirer et al. [ 18 ] thermal treatments of carbon in an inert gas atmosphere are likely to cause the pyrolysis of acidic groups and thereupon the formation of pyrone groups upon exposure to air. In contrast to other oxygen-containing surface groups, the pyrone functional groups behave as basic sites and probably contribute to the increased basicity observed at high temperatures ( Fig. 3 ) . The identification of functional groups by potentiometric titration is made difficult by the overlapping of groups with similar dissociation constants and the electronic effect of the carbon structure on their behaviour. According to the data reported in the literature [ 17,21 ] , the high basic strength constants found for our catalysts ( pKb = 3.2-3.7 ) may account for the presence of C-7r electron-donating sites or pyrone-type groups. High acidic dissociation constants (pKa=3.7-3.9) warrant the presence of carboxylic groups while lower acidic strength (pKe = 5.06.5 ) suggests the presence of phenols or anhydrides. Ketone complexes are presumed to be present in neutral or mildly acidic carbon materials [ 17,21 ] . To get a better insight into the nature of surface functionalities, FT-IR spectra (Fig. 4) and TPD measurements (Fig. Sa and b) were collected on Pt-loaded carbon samples activated at different temperatures. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the FT-IR spectra for the Ketjenblack carbon and the Pt-loaded carbons subjected 266 T.

TPD spectra of Pt/C catalysts activated at different temperatures. (a) 200 C, (b) 900 C. The catalysts correspond to the samples 3 and 20 in Table 1, respectively. to increasing activation temperatures. The most interesting features are observed in the region from 370 to 1900 cm-'. The shape of the absorption band in the 1480-1700 cm-' range appears to be similar in all the samples (Fig. 4) with maxima centered in a very narrow interval (1577-1586 cm-'). This band could be ascribed to the stretching vibration of a highly conjugated C=O group in a quinone configuration and to skeletal modes of the aromatic structure due to the highly graphitic character of Ketjenblack [ 22 ] . The broad absorption band observed in the 840-1500 cm-' region, in the Ketjenblack spectrum (Fig. 4, curve a), is attributed to the C-0 stretching mode of ethers and esthers that give rise to strong absorption bands in the region 1000-1300 cm-' [23,24]. It is observed in Fig. 4 (curve b) that a variation of the fine structure of the band at 840-150(? cm-' occurs on Pt-loaded carbons treated at low temperature. The band appears broadened and T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 267 composed of two distinct peaks occurring at about 1125 and 1235 cm-', with the IR intensity increasing at higher frequencies and accounting for the formation of carboxylic surface groups (C-0 stretching and OH bending vibrations). This view is strengthened by the evidence of strong acidic surface groups in the potentiometric titrations and from the COZ desorption at low temperature (200 C) in the TPD spectrum of the platinized carbon treated at 200 C (Fig. 5a). The IR spectrum of Pt-loaded carbon activated at 600 C shows sharper bands in the 900-1500 cm-' region probably accounting for the decomposition of carboxylic groups (Fig. 4, curve c). The peak at lower frequency (1125 cm -' ) is enhanced in intensity in the 600 C-treated sample whereas the higher frequency peak (1235 cm -') is larger in the 900 C sample (Fig. 4, curve d). A rearrangement towards a pyrone structure has been hypothesized to occur at this latter temperature as proven by a large increase in basicity (sample 20 in Table 1) . This seems to be confirmed by the CO2 detection in the TPD spectrum of a 900 C-activated Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 5b). The TPD spectrum of Ketjenblack showed no CO or COZ signals confirming the low-surface-oxygen content. A considerable evolution of CO and COZ is recorded in the sample activated at 200 C (Fig. 5a) accounting for the formation of carboxylic and lactone or Ketonic groups upon the chemical interaction of the Pt precursor with the carbon surface and subsequent air exposure. The peaks of CO2, CO, and OZ observed both at low and high temperatures (Fig. 5a) account for the formation of various oxygen-containing surface groups held to the carbon surface with different strength. It was pointed out that oxygen may interact with the carbonyl surface groups giving rise to a rearrangement towards a more stable pyrone structure [ 7 ] . The presence of the pyrone-like structure and Ketone-like groups in the hightemperature-activated Pt/C sample seems to be confirmed by the COZ and CO evolved in the TPD spectrum of sample 20 in Table 1 (Fig. 5b). These groups could have been formed during air-exposure after the heat treatment. The SOZ signal appearing in the low-activation temperature sample (200 C) is due to the reducing agent, Na2S204, used in the preparation procedure. The SOZ is desorbed at temperatures lower than 500 C and it is not observed in the TPD spectra of the sample activated at 900 C (Fig. 5b). The level of metal-support interaction was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [ 25 ] . The XPS Pt 4f, C 1 s and O 1 s spectra of a few typical Pt/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The binding energy shift (the difference between the BE of Pt 4f7,2 in the sample and that of the Pt metal used as an internal standard [26] ) was taken into account to evaluate the magnitude of interaction between the platinum and functional groups of the carbon support (Table 2) . Depending on the oxidation state of Pt, the Pt 4f signal is derived from 2 or 3 pairs of platinum peaks (Fig. 6). The most intense peaks (71-74 eV) are attributed to metallic Pt. The second set of doublets, 1.1-3.5 eV higher than Pt , can be assigned to the Pt\" chemical state in PtO and Pt (011) 2-like species [ 27 ] . The third doublet is observed at a BE approximately 3.6-5.4 eV higher than the metallic Pt. These BE shifts are attributed to the presence of Pt'v in Pt02-xH20 or Pt(OH)4-like 268 T.

A peak is also observed at about 289 eV (Fig. 7a) ; this seems to be due to either -COO or carbonate-like species [26]. The O is signal observed at around 531.7 eV in the XPS spectra (Table 2) can be attributed to Pt-0-like species (530 eV) and Pt-0Haas species ( 531.5 e V) [ 29 ] . The peak observed at 532.5 eV is ascribed to -C = 0 (Fig. 7b ) . T.

The oxidation of Pt in strong basic catalysts such as sample 20 in Table 2 could be ascribed to the co-ordination of Pt clusters by oxygenated basic functional groups such as the pyrone-type groups. This is strengthened by the presence of a high BE species ( 289 eV) in the XPS C 1 s spectrum of sample 20 ( Fig. 7a) that could be assigned to the effect of such oxygenated species. Graphitic basal plane sites, Car, having electron-releasing behaviour produce lower Pt BE shifts. The electrochemically active metal surface (MSAw) of Pt/C catalysts was determined from cyclic voltammetry. The Pt dispersion was also checked by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) . It was observed that the MSA values obtained by TEM were generally larger than the corresponding values by CV. In this regard a few hypotheses can be made. The spherical shape assumed for the Pt crystallites in the derivation of MSA by TEM does not occur for each particle (Fig. 8). By using high-resolution electron microscopy, Jalan [ 30] showed that Pt particles on carbon possess a two dimensional shape (i.e. flat, raft-like, disc-like), indicating the existence of a strong interaction between the Pt atoms and the carbon substrate. TEM measurements do not give information on the amount of Pt sites which are involved in co-ordination complexes with oxygen groups and hence are not electrochemically active. Furthermore, the chemical state of small Pt particles ( less than 10 ) can be different from bulk Pt; a significant amount of these particles can dissolve during electrochemical measurements. The difference between the T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 271 120 110 100 v) go E 80 Q 70 60 50 40 2 4 6 8 10 12 pHzpc Fig. 9. Variation of MSAcv values for acidic ( ) and basic ( & ) Pt/C catalyst series as a function of pl-hw. MSA values determined by CV and TEM is markedly larger in the samples activated at lower temperatures (Table 1). Fig. 9 shows the variation of the CV-determined metal surface area as a function of the pH. ,P,,,. The trend of data suggests that the MSA decreases with the increase of the pHZpc for each series of acidic or basic Pt/ C catalysts (Fig. 9). Moreover, it is observed that middle basic catalysts show higher metal surface area than the corresponding acidic samples. The formation of oxygenated functional groups, acting as anchoring centers for Pt clusters, in the low-temperature range, probably limits the metal particle growth. The progressive decomposition of these acidic surface groups with increasing temperature allows a fast growth of the Pt particles; simultaneously, the number of Pt sites blocked by coordination of surface groups decreases. The formation of Car sites with electron-releasing behaviour on the surface of weakly basic catalysts, probably accounts for the increased availability of electrochemically active Pt sites in the basic range. The XPS results showed that the lowest fraction of oxidized Pt sites is found for weakly basic catalysts whereas the Pt oxidation suddenly increases for weakly acidic and strongly basic catalysts. The electrochemical active surface area correspondingly increases in the weakly basic catalyst range. The large increase of Pt particle size for the samples activated at high temperatures and the formation of oxygen-containing pyrone groups that are probably coordinated to the Pt clusters, reduce the number of electrochemically active Pt sites in samples with strong basic behaviour. It can be concluded that both the sintering process and the metal-support interaction determine the electrochemically active surface area of Pt on the carbonblack support. The role exerted by surface functional groups as evidenced by the above discussion is quite complex. These groups act both as anchoring sites for Pt clusters and as surface-blocking co-ordination ligands, slowing down the sintering 272 T. Torre et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 114 (1994) 257-272 process, in the first case, and producing an increase of metal-support interaction, in the second case. It is believed that an appropriate tailoring of surface parameters of Pt/C catalysts is critical for the optimization of the performance of platinizedcarbon electrodes in fuel cells.
