A NEW METAL- CATALYSED REACTIONS: ISOMERIZATION OF 1,3-OXAZACYCLO- ALKANES TO CARBOXAMIDES ON PALLADIUM ARPAD MOLNAR, MIHALY BARTOK** Department of Organic Chemistry, Jozsef Attila University, Szeged (Hungary) GABOR CZIRA and JOZSEF TAMAS Central Research Institute of Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Budapest (Hungary) (Received July 4, 1988; accepted July 3, 1989) Summary The isomerization of six 5- and 6-membered 1,3-oxazacycloalkanes (3-methyl- and 2-alkyl-3-methyl-substituted oxazolidines and tetrahydro- 1,3-oxazines) to the corresponding carboxamides on a palladium catalyst has been established. From the results of isotope exchange, catalytic and stereo- chemical studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed to interpret this new cat- alytic process which involves the dissociative adsorption of the oxazacyclo- alkanes on C-2, followed by ring opening via the attack of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on ring carbon C-5 (or C-6). Introduction Our earlier studies of the chemical properties of N-containing organic compounds revealed some interesting selective transformations. It was found that certain 1,3-aminoalcohols yield ketones in the presence of copper-based catalysts [1, 2]. This reaction was utilized to develop a new method for the a-methylation of ketones [3]. The metal-catalysed hydrogenolyses of 2- and 3-azetidinones, resulting in the formation of different aminoalcohols in sel- ective ring-opening reactions [4, 5], are further examples of our research achievements in this field. These important results, together with our discovery of the regularities of the metal-catalysed transformations of 1,3-dioxacycloalkanes [6] and the intriguing problem of the ring-opening selectivities of different ring systems, led us to investigate the transformations of cyclic compounds containing both 0 and N atoms in the ring. *Part V: see [5]. **Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/S3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands It is known that the hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane on various metals occurs mainly at the 2,3-bond (bond b) [7], whereas in the case of 2- methyl-l,3-dioxacyclopentane, because of the adsorption through the oxygen atom, either bond a splitting or bond b splitting may be the main ring-opening direction, depending on the experimental conditions [6]. The ring opening of cycloalkanes with larger rings can be studied only with dif- ficulty because of the concurrent reactions, while the more selective ring opening of heterocycles might provide information of value in metal cat- alysis. Liquid-phase investigations of 1,3-oxazacycloalkanes in solvents under hydrogen pressure on Pd, Pt and Ni catalysts have demonstrated that only aminoalcohols formed via bond a splitting are obtained [8-12]. There are no literature data on the transformations of these cyclic compounds on metals in the gas phase. We now report on the transformations of six mono- and disubstituted 1,3-oxazacycloalkanes on a 3% Pd on Cab-0-Sil catalyst. Experimental Materials 3-Methyl-l,3-oxazolidine (la) and 3-methyltetrahydro-l,3-oxazine (Ib) were prepared by refluxing equimolar amounts of formaldehyde and the corresponding JV-methyl-aminoalcohols in benzene, water being removed with a Dean-Stark trap [13,14]. In the preparation of the other compounds studied, an equimolar amount of the appropriate aldehyde was added drop- wise to JV-methylaminoethanol or JV-methylaminopropanol at 0 C. After 2 h stirring, the organic layer which separated out after shaking with KOH pel- lets was distilled off. All compounds gave boiling points consistent with those reported in the literature, and proved to be 100% pure on GLC. 3- Methyl-2-(l,l-dimethylethyl)-l,3-oxazolidine (4a), synthesized and charac- terized for the first time, had a b.p. of 175 -177 C. The catalyst used con- tained 3% Pd on Cab-0-Sil M5 (BDH silica) support; it was prepared by wet impregnation [15] and was characterized by oxygen-hydrogen titration (dispersion = 15.4%). MeN. MeN^^O R R=H 1a R=H 1b B 2a B 2b iPr 3d tBu4a Methods Measurements were made in a flow microreactor with 20 mg catalyst, pretreated at 300 C in flowing hydrogen (deuterium) or in a mixture of 10% hydrogen in nitrogen for 1.5 h before use. A sinter-glass vapour saturator was used for the addition of the reactants (feeding rates: 0.1 - 0.2 g h~1 at a car- rier gas flow rate of 40 ml min~1). The carrier gases were purified by passage through an Alltech Oxy-Trap purifier. The deuterium gas used in isotope labelling studies was prepared from D-fl with a General Electric 15EHG2B4 generator. A Carlo Erba Fractovap Mod. G gas chromatograph was used to analyse product mixtures (1.2 m 15% 0V 17 on silanized Kieselguhr column, 140 C, flow rate of hydrogen carrier gas 20 - 30 ml min\"1). The compounds formed were identified via the GLC retentions of independently synthesized authen- tic compounds and through IR (Unicam SP 1000) and NMR (JEOL C 60- HL) spectroscopy. Analyses of deuterium-labelled compounds were carried out by GC-MS (Pye-104 GC instrument with a 2 m 3% OV-17 column, 130 C, 20 ml min-1 He. VG-MM-12F1A MS equipment with EI/CI source, source temperature 150 C, 5-s scans, Datamass One data system). 'H and \"C NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian VXR 400 spectrometer. Results Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2 give the results of catalytic studies. Taken together with the observation that neither the support itself nor Pd Cab-0- SU without hydrogen are active, these permit the following conclusions.

(i) Compounds formed by cleavage of bonds a and b predominate among the products (Scheme 1). Bond 6 rupture led to the recognition of a new metal-catalysed reaction: the isomerization of 1,3-oxazacycloalkanes to carboxamides (7, 8). (ii) Variations in the temperature and the hydrogen content of the car- rier gas, both influencing the hydrogen availibility, have a great effect on the a to b cleavage ratio for certain compounds (2a, 3a, Ib). Under reaction con- ditions ensuring a high hydrogen coverage of the catalyst (low temperature, the use of pure hydrogen), a rupture predominates (formation of amino- alcohol), while at low hydrogen coverage (high temperature, low hydrogen partial pressure) b rupture predominates (formation of carboxamide). (iii) Independently of the reaction conditions, 2b yields mainly amino- alcohol (a rupture), while la and 4a exhibit selective b cleavage (formation of carboxamide). (iv) In the oxazolidine series, ethyl substitution (2a) increases the react- ivity significantly compared with that of the unsubstituted compound (la), but a further increase in the bulk of the alkyi substituent on C-2 (3a, 4a) results in a decrease in reactivity. In order to obtain data useful in the interpretation of the mechanisms of the above transformations, reactions of four compounds (la, 2a, Ib, 2b) a- IS 000 000 t a 00 M' < co Ib mmm llliiiiiniiiiiiiii|iiiiiiin mm 0 'S <;. 0 0000 t <; (ft o t ^o co o 2a 2a* 2b 3. The 70 eV mass spectra of light and labelled starting compounds la, la*, Ib, ,2a,2a*,2b,2b*. were carried out in deuterium. Interpretation of the mass spectra of the recovered starting materials, based in part on certain literature data [16] and on the NMR spectra of Ib* (asterisks indicate labelled compounds), leads to the following conclusions. (v) Compounds la*, 2a* and Ib* contain mainly di and d; species, while in 2b* d:;, d3 and d4 are more abundant (Fig. 3). (vi) It is difficult to locate the deuterium atoms in la* and Ib* because of the significant M-l peaks (Fig. 3). However, the \"C NMR spectrum of Ib* recovered after a reaction under very mild conditions (150 C, feeding rate 0.4 g h~1) indicates exclusive monodeuterium exchange on C-2. In con- trast, the great majority of the deuterium content is lost via elimination of the ethyl group from the molecular ions of 2a* and 2b*. The product frag- ment ions consist mainly of do and d; species, respectively (Fig. 3). The MS and NMR spectra of the product carboxamides and aminoalco- hols provide the following information of use in the mechanistic interpreta- tion. (vii) Although the carboxamides also exhibit multiple exchange (Table 2), an important labelled position can be identified unequivocally: the ter- minal carbon of the JV-alkyI group is monodeuterated (compare the M\"1'- methyl and m/z = 44 peaks in the spectra of 7a and 7a*, and the Methyl and mfz = 44 peaks in the spectra of 7b and 7b* in Fig. 4). This carbon was originally at the C-5 (or C-6) position in the oxazacycloalkane ring. Propio- namides 8a* and 8b*, formed from the 2-ethyl-substituted rings (2a, 2b), also contain deuterium in the propionyl group.

Discussion In principle, carboxamide formation can be considered to be an intramolecular isomerization (H migration) via a C 0 O-TT bond shift mech- anism, while aminoalcohols are formed as a result of hydrogenolysis. Both ring-opening reactions may occur through an associative or a dissociative mechanism, depending on the reaction conditions and other factors influenc- ing the adsorption possibilities of the rings. The fact that cleavage of bonds a and b predominates, together with the difference in electronegativity of the two heteroatoms, points to adsorption via oxygen. An additional factor sup- porting the latter conclusion is the possibility of a stronger, two-electron pair adsorption via oxygen, as was discussed in connection with the metal- catalysed transformations of oxacycloalkanes [17]. Catalytic studies also revealed the decisive role of the hydrogen availab- ility on the ring-opening selectivities of certain compounds. These observa- tions show that carboxamides are formed under conditions of low hydrogen availability, which is a strong indication for a dissociative mechanism, while an associative mechanism can be operative in the formation of aminoalcohols. 10 /\\ R-S, Wn 0 H Scheme 2. The differences in deuterium distribution of the recovered starting materials supply further evidence in support of the above conclusions. Deuterium exchange at C-2 in the unsubstituted compounds (la, Ib) clearly shows that these rings can adsorb dissociatively and reversibly via C-2 (Scheme 2, route B). In contrast, as indicated by observation (vi) (almost exclusive exchange in the ethyl group, i.e. lack of exchange on C-2), the adsorption of the 2-substituted compounds through C-2 may be either irreversible or impossible. The former possibility is operative in the trans- formation of 2a. This can be rationalized by the easy removal of the reactive single H from C-2, resulting in a shift of the adsorption equilibrium towards formation of the product carboxamide. The significant difference in the reactivities of la and 2a lends added support to this conclusion. 11 Stereochemical studies of the 2-alkyl-substituted 1,3-oxazolidines (2a-4a) likewise point to the crucial role of adsorption via C-2 in the formation of carboxamides. The decreasing reactivity of these compounds with increasing bulk of the alkyi groups is clear evidence of the increasing steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituents hindering the removal of H from C-2. In addition to its low conversion, 4a also exhibits selective carboxamide formation. This might indicate a change in the mechanism, starting with an associative adsorption (Scheme 2, route A). A similar explanation can be put forward to account for the selective formation of carboxamide from la. As regards the formation of aminoalcohols, an associative ring opening is suggested by catalytic studies. The transformation of 2b, the only com- pound not yielding a significant amount of carboxamide under any exper- imental conditions, provides further data clarifying additional details of the mechanism. If the results of conformational analysis are considered which indicate both fast nitrogen and ring inversions [18], and with regard to the high reaction temperature applied in our studies, any conformation of the adsorbed molecule can be supposed. When the deuterium exchange in the ethyl substituent is taken into account, the adsorption through both the ethyl group and oxygen, presumably in a two-electron pair manner [17], may fix the molecule in a conformation in which H-2 and C-6 are each far from the surface, preventing carboxamide formation. A comparison of the deuterium contents of the recovered starting material and the product aminoalcohol indicates that the extremely high degree of exchange in amino- alcohols is, in part, a result of exchange after ring opening in the aminoal- cohol stage. However, observation (v), pointing to the more extensive deuter- ium exchange in 2b* than in other rings, strongly suggests that aminoalco- hols are formed through multiple-bonded surface-adsorbed species (Scheme 2, route C).

From the results of isotope exchange, catalytic and stereo-chemical studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed to interpret this new catalytic process which involves the dissociative adsorption of the oxazacyclo-alkanes on C-2, followed by ring opening via the attack of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on ring carbon C-5 (or C-6).",
