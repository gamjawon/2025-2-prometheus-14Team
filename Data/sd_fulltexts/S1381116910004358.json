Graphical abstract Research highlights ▶ Two catalyst support system has been designed. ▶ Higher catalytic activity than homopolymer mixture or non-supported analogues. ▶ Supported catalyst system can be partially recycled. A two-catalyst system comprising of salen(AlCl) and pybox(ErCl3) complexes supported onto poly(norbornene) has been developed. As a proof of concept the activity of the two-catalyst system was gauged for the addition of cyanide to α,β-unsaturated imides which has been shown to follow a bimetallic mechanism. The activity of the supported two-catalyst system was significantly higher than catalytic systems derived from mixtures of the two catalysts. In addition, the co-polymer could be readily recovered and reused up to 3 cycles without significant loss in conversions and yields. Nevertheless, a decrease in enantioselectivity of the cyanide adduct was observed with each subsequent cycle indicating some loss in catalytic selectivity. The reported strategy opens up avenues for supporting multiple catalysts on the same polymer backbone for catalyst-based one-pot cascade reactions. Keywords Supported catalysis Salen ROMP Aluminum Bimetallic mechanism 1 Introduction A rapidly emerging area in salen catalysis involves the immobilization of salen catalysts onto polymers [1–4]. Supported catalysts can be removed readily from reaction mixtures and often recycled resulting in higher turn over numbers as well as lower metallic waste disposal for these catalysts as compared to their unsupported analogs. We have demonstrated that a flexible polymer backbone enhances the activity of salen catalysts for reactions involving a bimetallic transition state such as the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epoxides or the cyanide addition to α,β-unsaturated imides [1,5–9]. We hypothesize that the flexible backbone enhances the local catalyst concentration thereby improving the catalytic activity of transformations that have bimetallic transition state. There are, however, no examples where multiple catalysts that work together in a bimetallic transition state have been supported onto the same polymer backbone. In this contribution, we realize such a goal by extending our expertise in supported salen catalysis and norbornene chemistry by immobilizing two catalysts onto poly(norbornene) using highly functional group tolerant ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) [10,11]. Furthermore, we investigate the catalytic activity of the resulting catalyst system and compare it to its non-supported analogues. An ideal reaction to evaluate our multiple supported catalyst system is the conjugate addition of cyanide to α,β-unsaturated imides since it has been reported that a combination of salen(AlCl) and pybox(ErCl3) complexes works superior to each individual complex for the reaction catalysis [12,13]. Poly(norbornene) was chosen as the support since norbornene monomers can be polymerized in a highly controlled and often living fashion using functional group tolerant ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that poly(norbornene) enhances the catalytic activity of salen(AlCl) for the cyanide addition reaction making poly(norbornene)-supported salen (AlCl) catalysts ideal candidates for our study [8]. The basic target copolymer 1 consisting of poly(norbornene) that supports salen(AlCl) and pybox(ErCl3) complexes is shown in Fig. 1 . 2 Experimental 2.1 General All starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. All air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were performed using oven-dried or flame-dried glassware under an inert atmosphere of dry argon or nitrogen. Air- or moisture-sensitive liquids and solutions were transferred via syringe or cannula. Dichloromethane and acetonitrile were distilled from calcium hydride, acetone from potassium carbonate, toluene from sodium, and 2-propanol from calcium sulfate. Thionyl chloride was distilled prior to use. Caution: Trimethylsilyl cyanide and hydrogen cyanide are highly toxic and should be handled extremely carefully in a fume hood as per the experimental protocol mentioned below. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using Silica XHL pre-coated (250μm thickness) glass backed TLC plates from Sorbent Technologies. Eluting solvents are reported as volume ratios or volume percents. Compounds were visualized using UV light, potassium permanganate, p-anisaldehyde or iodine stains.

Subsequently, the imide 13 (50mg, 0.26mmol, 1equiv.), toluene (80μL) and TMSCN (132μL, 1.06mmol, 4equiv.) were added to the tube. The reaction mixture was heated gently with a heat gun, immersed in an oil bath at 45°C and isopropanol was added (81μL, 1.06mmol, 4equiv.). The flask was sealed and allowed to stir for 18h, following which the reaction mixture was vented into a FeSO4 solution to quench any un-reacted hydrogen cyanide. After allowing the HCN to bubble out for 10–15min, the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford the crude cyanide adduct 14 which was purified by flash column chromatography. 2.14 General procedure for cyanide addition reaction using catalyst 1 (Table 2) and recycling studies Catalyst 1 (22.4mg, 0.013mmol, 0.05equiv.) was added to a Schlenk tube (50mL) equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The catalyst was dried azeotropically with toluene (2×50μL). Subsequently, the imide 13 (50mg, 0.26mmol, 1equiv.), toluene (80μL) and TMSCN (132μL, 1.06mmol, 4equiv.) were added to the tube. The reaction mixture was heated gently with a heat gun, immersed in an oil bath at 45°C and isopropanol was added (81μL, 1.06mmol, 4equiv.). The flask was sealed and allowed to stir for 18h, following which the reaction mixture was vented into a FeSO4 solution to quench any un-reacted hydrogen cyanide. After allowing the HCN to bubble out for 10–15min, the solvent was removed in vacuo. Ethyl acetate (4×20mL) was added to extract the crude cyanide adduct 14, while the catalyst 1 precipitated from the solution. The combined supernatant solutions were concentrated to afford the crude cyanide adduct 14 which was purified by flash column chromatography. The residue comprised catalyst 1 which was dried under vacuum and used for subsequent catalytic cycles. 2.15 N-[3-(S)-cyano-butyryl]-benzamide 14 [1H] NMR (300MHz, CDCl3) δ =8.88 (s, 1H, NH), 7.89 (dd, 2H, J =8.0Hz, J =1.5Hz, H Ar), 7.64 (t, 1H, J =7Hz, H Ar), 7.54 (t, 2H, J =6.3Hz, H Ar), 3.47 (dd, 1H, J =17.2Hz, J =7Hz, CHCN), 3.31 (m, 1H CNCHCHH); 3.2 (m, 1H, NCCHCHH), 1.45 (d, 3H, J =7.3Hz, CH 3 ). Enantioselectivities were determined using HPLC with a chiral Pirkle-l-Leucine column with 5% ethanol in hexane as the eluant (0.7mLmin−1) and the detector set at 254nm. 2.16 Procedure for the kinetics studies with 5mol% loading of catalyst 1 The addition reaction was divided into four NMR tubes. In each tube the catalyst (3mg, 0.002mmol, 0.05equiv.), imide substrate 13 (7.6mg. 0.04mmol, 1equiv.) and toluene (4μL) were added. The NMR tube was sealed with a septum and TMSCN (20μL, 0.16mmol, 4equiv.) and 2-propanol (12μL, 0.16mmol, 4equiv.) were added. The reaction was heated to 45°C and quenched at the appropriate time by adding CDCl3 (200μL). 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane (0.0075mmol) in CDCl3 (100μL) was added to the NMR tube as an internal standard. The NMR tube was agitated in an ultrasound bath and filtered through a pad of silica to remove the catalyst. The silica was rinsed with (400μL) of CDCl3 and the combined filtrates were analyzed by 1H NMR to determine the amount of product 13 found (data shown in Fig. S1 in supporting information). 3 Results and discussion The synthesis of catalyst 1 can be envisioned by copolymerizing the R-salen monomer 2 and the R-pybox monomer 3. Linkers comprised of seven carbon atoms were chosen for both monomers as we have demonstrated before that this is the preferred length for facilitating bimetallic reactions using poly(norbornene)-supported salen catalysts [5,9]. The R-salen monomer 2 was synthesized as described earlier [8]. The pybox monomer 3 was synthesized in several steps from the diester 4 as described in Scheme 1 [15]. The hydroxyl group of 4 is reacted with benzyl bromide and potassium carbonate to afford the ether 5 in 90% yield. The diesters in 5 are then hydrolyzed using potassium hydroxide and ethanol and subsequently treated under reflux with thionyl chloride to form the diacid chloride 6 in 73% yield [14]. Acid chloride 6 is then treated with R-phenyl glycinol and triethyl amine at room temperature for 24h, followed by the reaction with thionyl chloride to afford the open form 7 of pybox in 46% yield [16]. The benzyl group is removed via hydrogenation using palladium on carbon to afford 8 in 99% yield. Treating 8 with norbornene bromide 9 and potassium carbonate leads to etherification of the hydroxyl position as well as the ring-closing of the pybox in one-pot to yield the non-metallated monomer 10 in 64% yield. Since, the Er-pybox complex was generated in situ during the catalytic reaction in an earlier report [12], the non-metallated pybox monomer 10 was polymerized with salen monomer 2 using Grubbs’ 3rd generation initiator to provide random co-polymer 11 in 70% yield (Scheme 1, pathway a). The resulting co-polymer was not fully soluble in organic solvents presumably due to the co-ordination of Al from the salen to some of the free pybox ligands resulting potentially in crosslinks [17]. Crosslinking of the polymer through co-ordination of Ru from the initiator to multiple pybox ligands was ruled out since the homopolymerization of 10 gave the highly soluble pybox homopolymer 12 which could be readily characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The insolubility of the co-polymer 11 prevented its characterization by NMR spectroscopy as well as gel-permeation chromatography. Therefore, the polymer composition (m + n and m:n) is based approximately on the monomer/initiator ratios used during polymerization. Despite the limited solubility of the copolymer 11 and the incapability to completely characterize 11 we were interested in examining its catalytic activity before optimizing the synthesis of the catalytic system. Hence, the catalytic activity of 11 was studied for the cyanide addition to α,β-unsaturated imide 13 for the synthesis of cyanide adduct 14. The erbium complex was generated in the reaction flask by stirring 11 with ErCl3 in acetonitrile and removing the solvents prior to addition of the reagents [12]. The catalytic reaction was carried out in toluene at 45°C with 5mol% of the catalyst and the cyanide was generated in situ from trimethyl silyl cyanide and isopropanol [18]. The substrate was added and the reaction flask was sealed to prevent cyanide leakage which prevented monitoring of the reaction by thin layer chromatography. Hence, the reaction was carried out for 18h to ensure completion. In order to gauge the effect of having the two catalysts on the same polymer backbone on catalysis a comparison was made with dual catalyst systems obtained by combining salen homopolymer 15 either with the small molecule pybox 16 or the pybox homopolymer 12, respectively (Fig. 2 ). The catalyst studies (Table 1) indicated that the dual catalyst systems in entries 1 and 2, afforded lower yields and enantioselectivities for the cyanide adduct 14. The best yield of 70% with an enantioselectivity of 84% was obtained when both catalysts were supported on the same polymer backbone (entry 3). The transition state for the reaction is hypothesized to be bimetallic with the imide co-ordinated to the salen(AlCl) and the cyanide co-ordinated to the pybox [12]. Hence, having the salen(AlCl) on a polymer backbone (entry 1) might lower the accessibility of pybox 16 thereby lowering its interaction with the Al-center in the transition. The effect worsened when the pybox is also supported on a polymer and is alleviated in entry 3 where both catalysts are on the same polymer backbone. This result was intriguing from a mechanistic point of view despite the fact that the catalytic system derived from polymer 11 was less active than our previously reported salen(AlCl) homopolymer [8]. Therefore, we wished to optimize the performance of the dual catalyst system by synthesizing a more soluble variant of polymer 11. Since we attributed the lower solubility of polymer 11 to the presence of free pybox, we metallated the ligand prior to polymerization (Scheme 1, pathway b). The metallated monomer 3 was copolymerized with 2 in a 9:9:1 ratio (3:2:initiator) to afford polymer 1 which was soluble in organic solvents such as dichloromethane. Characterization by GPC was not possible since the highly charged, metal complex-containing polymers did not elute from the GPC columns. Unfortunately, the paramagnetism of Er prevented characterization by NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, elemental analysis was used to characterize polymer 1. As before the polymer composition was approximately calculated based on the monomer/initiator ratio used for the polymerization. The catalytic activity of polymer 1 was studied for the above described cyanide addition using the reaction conditions described above and the results are shown in Table 2. A significant improvement in activity was observed with 98% conversion (88% isolated yield) for the formation of 14 (entry 1) with comparable enantioselectivities to 11. Furthermore, the product could be isolated by extraction into ethyl acetate and decantation. The catalyst remained in the reaction flask and could be used for 3 cycles with no significant losses in conversion (entries 2 and 3). A drop in ee was observed indicating a loss in catalytic selectivity with each subsequent cycle. Since this loss in enantioselectivity was not observed with the salen(AlCl) homopolymer reported earlier by our group, the loss in enantioselectivity might be attributed to the degradation of the chiral pybox ligand [8]. Despite the loss in enantioselectivity the fact that we were able to synthesize a reusable complex two-catalyst system supported onto poly(norbornene) which efficiently catalyzed the cyanide addition reaction is extremely encouraging [19]. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have supported salen(AlCl) and pybox(ErCl3) onto a single poly(norbornene) backbone in a random fashion. The resulting catalyst system was able to efficiently catalyze the addition of cyanide to α,β-unsaturated imides. Supporting both catalysts on the same polymer backbone enhanced the formation of the cyanide adduct as compared to catalyst systems derived from a mixture of the two catalysts. Furthermore, the random co-polymer 1 could be used for 3 cycles without significant loss in conversions and yields. A loss in enantioselectivity of the cyanide adduct was observed indicating a decrease in the catalytic selectivity over multiple cycles. The fact that we were able to readily support two catalysts onto the same polymer backbone and demonstrate its utility for catalysis paves the way for developing more efficient two catalyst systems or multiple catalyst systems that can be utilized for catalyzing multiple reactions or tandem reactions in a one-pot setting.

As a proof of concept the activity of the two-catalyst system was gauged for the addition of cyanide to α,β-unsaturated imides which has been shown to follow a bimetallic mechanism. The activity of the supported two-catalyst system was significantly higher than catalytic systems derived from mixtures of the two catalysts. In addition, the co-polymer could be readily recovered and reused up to 3 cycles without significant loss in conversions and yields. Nevertheless, a decrease in enantioselectivity of the cyanide adduct was observed with each subsequent cycle indicating some loss in catalytic selectivity. The reported strategy opens up avenues for supporting multiple catalysts on the same polymer backbone for catalyst-based one-pot cascade reactions.",
