Bid. du Triomphe, B-1050 Brussels (Belgium) Summary Supported catalysts containing chlorine originating from the precursor salt used in preparation have been shown previously to exhibit two features towards hydrogen adsorption not found in model catalysts: (1) a very important slow adsorption (2) a very high heat of adsorption at low coverage (strong adsorption). In the present paper, the adsorption of hydrogen is studied on two Rh/AlaOg chlorine-free catalysts: one prepared using ?(N03)3 as precursor; the second one, a previously studied catalyst that has been dechlorinated. It is shown here that both slow and strong adsorption is due mainly to the presence of chlorine. Introduction Studies of adsorption and of catalytic activity may generally be divided into two groups, according to whether the measurements are conducted on model catalysts or on real, practical catalysts. The group of model catalysts comprises all clean unsupported forms of metal single crystals, evaporated films, powders although supported catalysts of low dispersion showing well-defined crystal faces, and in which metal-support interactions are negligible, may also be included in this group. The group of real catalysts comprises only supported catalysts, generally highly dispersed and in which metal-support interactions are important. When studying hydrogen adsorption on platinum group metals, striking differences between model and real catalysts are observed. This is illustrated in the following for the case of rhodium, the metal examined in this paper, but similar facts have been reported for other metals of the Pt group. On Rh model catalysts the adsorption of Ha is characterized by: very high values of the sticking coefficient a: values of a at zero *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 258 coverage, (TO as high as 0.65 are cited for Rh [I], which decrease slowly and in most cases following the law a = (T()(I - 6)2; adsorption is thus rapid. moderate values of the heat of adsorption Q, around 85 kJmol\"1 at zero coverage and decreasing to ~29kJmol~1 at coverage around 0.7 [2]. a stoichiometry of adsorption close to 1 adsorbed hydrogen atom per 1 metal surface atom (H/Ms= 1) [2]. On real catalysts, the situation is quite different. Results obtained in our lab [2-5], as well as those of the literature [6] indicate that, quite frequently, the adsorption of Hg may be broken down into a fast and a slow process, adsorption equilibrium being attained after several hours [2 5], the maximum duration found in the literature being 48 h [6]. The amount adsorbed during the slow process may be almost equal to that adsorbed during the fast process [4]. The adsorption heat at low coverage may also be much higher than on model catalysts. By an isosteric analysis of a set of adsorption isotherms at different temperature, we measured values of the heat of adsorption higher than 188kJmor1 at low coverage [4]. This must be related to the so-called 'strong* adsorption of Ha, which has been reviewed recently and which is generally characterized by an abnormally high desorption temperature in thermal desorption experiments [7]. On supported catalysts, values as high as 1.8 [8] have been found for the ratio H/M (the number H of adsorbed hydrogen atoms to the total number of metal atoms M); as M/Mg is necessarily ssl, the ratio H/Mg is thus ^1.8, a stoichiometric ratio much higher than the classical value of 1. In all cases where these abnormal values of sticking coefficient, adsorption heat and H/M are cited in the literature, the catalysts were prepared using chloride as the precursor salt. Recently the influence of chlorine on the chemisorption properties of Ru catalysts was studied by Lu and Tatarchuk [9]; they showed that chlorine may be deposited on a chlorine-free catalyst by treating it with HClaq, and that this treatment has two effects: (1) a fraction of (fast) chemisorption sites is lost; (2) new sites are created on which hydrogen adsorption is slow and activated. In our lab, the adsorption of hydrogen was recently studied on two Rh/AlgOa catalysts prepared from RhCIa by the incipient wetness technique, with different dispersions [4]. These catalysts were also characterized by several other techniques: TPO, TPR, EXAFS, etc. [10-13]. Both catalysts exhibited a very important slow adsorption that was also activated. Equil- ibrium of adsorption could be attained after a reasonable delay, less than half an hour, only by heating the catalyst in the presence of Hg at ~470K. Adsorption heats at low coverage were found to be higher than 190 kJ mol~1 and on the mostly dispersed catalyst, the H/Rh value was 1.45. Although the TPR results indicated that, under the conditions used, the reduction of the metal was complete, the only possible interpretation of these results was that residual chlorine in an unknown chemical form was responsible for the observed effects. After completion of this work [4], it was found that the studied catalysts effectively contained residual chlorine. 259 The object of this paper is to obtain experimental evidence concerning the influence of chlorine on Hz adsorption. Results obtained on a chlorine-free (nitrate precursor) Rh catalyst as well as on a dechlorinated catalyst are reported in this paper and compared with those obtained previously on chlorine-containing catalysts. Experimental Catalysts Two catalysts were studied: (i) a chlorine-free catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness technique from Rh(N03)a as precursor and AlgOa (Alon C Degussa) as support. Rh content was 1.66% by weight. After impregnation the catalyst was first dried in air at 415 K, when under He flux at 673 K during 2 h; the temperature was then reduced to 573 K and He replaced by Ha. Reduction under Ha flux was carried out during 5 h, the catalyst then cooled to room temperature under He flux and introduced in the chemisorption apparatus in the presence of air. Further treatments were carried out in situ and are described later. (ii) a 4.8% Rh/AlaOs whose preparation and properties were described elsewhere, and on which a complete study of Ha chemisorption has been carried out in our lab [8]. After completion of this work, this catalyst was found to contain 1.1% by weight of chlorine (Cl/Rh=0.66) as measured by X-ray fluorescence. Chlorine could be eliminated by washing the catalyst with dilute ammonia solution (0.1 N) at room temperature for 15 h. The residual chlorine content after washing was ~0.05%. After washing, the catalyst was dried at 400 K and introduced in the chemisorption apparatus where the pretreatments previously applied to the original catalyst (oxidation at 573 K under Oa flux, reduction at 673 K under Ha flux) were applied again. Apparatus and procedure for adsorption measurements The apparatus and procedure have already been described [14]. Adsorption measurements were conducted in a fused Pyrex apparatus provided with glass stainless steel bellow valves, by a classical volumetric method. The pressure measuring devices were: a Texas Instruments Bourdon gauge (range either lO^^Otorr or 4xl0-3-1200torr). a differentially mounted system of 2 Pirani gauges (range 10~6- 0.15 torr). Adsorption isotherms measurements were conducted in the desorption mode. All adsorption results are expressed in H/M (here H/Rh) units. Results General: fast and slow adsorptions ofHs The adsorption of Ha on both catalysts at room temperature and lower may be decomposed into a fast process and a slow process. As it takes around 260 30 s to obtain the first pressure measurement after the admission of Hg in the presence of the catalyst, we define, in an empirical way, the 'rapidly adsorbed amount' as the amount adsorbed after 1 min. During the slow process, the increase in the adsorbed amount is proportional to the logarithm of the time [4]. At low temperature, the slow process does not seem to stop after more than 20 h. The real end-point of this slow process is determined in an empirical way by the loss of integrity of the vacuum system that forces the operator to declare at a certain moment that steady state is attained. The amount adsorbed during the slow process generally represents an important fraction of and in some cases is almost equal to the amount adsorbed during the fast process. At 473 K, a slow process is still observed, but it stops after 15 min. The corresponding adsorbed amount represents less than 2% of the amount adsorbed during the fast process. Figure 1 in the form of bar graphs illustrates the relative importance of the fast and slow process for both catalysts studied here (Fig. 1, 2 A B C and 5 A B 0] and by way of comparison for two catalysts previously studied (Fig. 1, 1 A B C and 4 A B C], The procedure used previously is again followed: hydrogen is placed in the presence of the catalyst at 193 K and the adsorbed amounts measured after 1 min (fast process) and after 1 h (slow process) are shown on bar A by white and hatched bars respectively; the whole system is then heated at room temperature during 1 h, then cooled again to 193 K; the corresponding adsorbed amounts at 193 K measured after 1 min and after 1 h are shown on bar B; the whole system is then heated to 473 K, then cooled again to 193 K, at which the same measurements are repeated [bar C]. It must be noted that, as we are in a closed system, with no addition or removal of hydrogen, the equilibrium pressures corresponding to measurements shown by bars A B and C are different.

All results in Fig. 1 are expressed in percent of the maximum adsorbed amount (H/Rh)max at 193 K, measured after heating at 473 K. Corresponding absolute values of (H/Rh)max are given in the legend of Fig. 1. The procedure used here is quite similar to the 'temperature jump experiments' made by Lu and Tatarchuk [9] in their study of hydrogen adsorption on Ru catalysts. The comparison between the different catalysts indicates that: (1) on the dechlorinated catalyst, the total adsorbed amount is reduced by -25% (from 7.33 x 10-2 to 5.40 x 10-2 in H/Rh units). (2) this reduction is for the most part due to the reduction of the amount of Hg adsorbed during the slow process. But this process is not completely suppressed. The amount adsorbed during the fast process is 4.54 x 10-2 in H/Rh units. (3) the amounts adsorbed during the fast process on the chlorinated and dechlorinated catalysts are equal, within experimental error: compare 1A and 3A in Fig. 1. (4) on the catalyst prepared from Rh(N03)a, slow adsorption is still very important, representing 45% of the total adsorption, about the same proportion as on the chlorinated samples. In an attempt to clarify the situation concerning the catalyst prepared from Rh(NOa)3, and following the method used for the chlorinated samples in the previous work, we have investigated the effect of reduction temperature on the total adsorption capacity and on the relative importance of the slow process. The reduction temperature was varied from 573 to 973 K. The effect on the relative importance of the slow process is negligible. The effect on total adsorption is also negligible, except at the highest reduction temperature (973 K) where a loss of adsorption capacity of ~20% is observed. This loss is reduced to 10% after oxidation under Og flow at atmospheric pressure and 773 K, followed by reduction at 673 K under Hg flow without influence on the fast/slow adsorption ratio. Adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption Adsorption isotherms were measured in the desorption mode on both catalysts in a wide range of experimental conditions (193<T<500K, 10~3 <P < 30 torr). Before every measurement, the catalysts were outgassed at 523 K; Ha is placed in the presence of the catalyst at 473 K for 1 hour; the whole system is then cooled to 193 K, at which the reproducibility of the adsorption capacity is controlled, then heated to the temperature where the desorption isotherm is measured. Usually, the adsorbed amount depends more or less linearly upon the logarithm of the pressure. Results on 1.66% Rh/AlgOa catalyst are presented in Fig. 2A and on the dechlorinated 4.8% Rh/AlzOa in Fig. 2B. From the set of measured isotherms, the isosteric adsorption heat Q is calculated. Results are presented in Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3 are also given, for purpose of comparison, the adsorption heats measured on two model catalysts [5] (Rh film and Rh powder) as well as on the chlorinated catalysts previously studied [4].

But at high coverage (03s 0.5), the values of Q are the same, within experimental error, for all catalysts. Discussion From the results obtained, three main points must be emphasized. (1) The important and almost equal reduction of both slow and total adsorptions observed on the dechlorinated catalyst, as compared with the original chlorinated one under otherwise identical conditions. (2) The fact that on chlorinated samples, very high values of adsorption heat at low coverage, more than 190kJmol~1, are observed, whereas: (a) on the dechlorinated sample the corresponding values are equal to those measured on powder and thus may be considered as normal; (b) on the chlorine-free (nitrate precursor) catalyst, the adsorption heats are somewhat higher than on the model catalysts, but do not exceed ~110kJmol~1 (as compared to the 'normal' value of 85 kJ mol\"1). (3) The fact that a high coverage, all values of the adsorption heat for the different supported catalysts, chlorinated or not, are, within experimental error, equal to the heat of adsorption on pure Rh powder or Rh film. 264 It then seems that: (1) 'slow* and 'strong* adsorptions are two aspects of the same special form of adsorption; (2) the presence of chlorine on the surface is certainly largely respon- sible for this special form of adsorption; (3) 'fast' adsorption may thus be related to the pure metal. If these ideas are founded, fast adsorption, i.e. adsorption on the metal, must be characterized by 'normal' values of the heat of adsorption. On both the chlorinated and the dechlorinated 4.8% Rh/Al203 catalyst, the 'rapidly adsorbed amounts' at 193 K are equal. One may assume that, in the temperature and pressure ranges used for isotherm measurements, the hydrogen adsorbed on 'chlorinated sites' is not desorbed, due to the very high adsorption heat characterizing such sites. Using this assumption, one may estimate the coverage 0,n on the metal by: (H/Rh) - 2.79 x IP-2 4.54 x 10-2 where 2.79 x 10~2 represents the difference between the total adsorbed amount on the chlorinated sample (7.33 x 10~2) and the 'rapidly' adsorbed amount on both chlorinated and dechlorinated catalysts (4.54 x 10~2). A similar calculation is made using the results obtained with the chlorine-free (nitrate precursor) catalyst. The corrected curves Q =f(0) are given in Fig. 4 and compared with the corresponding Q =f(6) curves of model catalysts. All values of the adsorption heat now lie in the range of values measured on model catalysts, except at very low coverage (0ni<0-l), at which the assumptions underlying the calculation probably cease to be valid. If only fast' adsorption is related to adsorption on metal particles, then quite normal values of H/M may be deduced from 'fast' H/M value. For example, on the highly dispersed chlorinated 1.04% Rh/AlgOs catalyst previously studied [4], where the H/M (fast + slow processes) value was 1.45, the 'fast' H/M is ~0.75, indicating a 75% dispersion, which is in the range that may be deduced from EXAFS measurements [10]. These com- ments support a recent proposal of van't Blik and Prins [15]: only the rapidly adsorbed amount should be used to calculate the dispersion, using for H/Ma the classical value of 1. The presence of chlorine on metal particles seems thus excluded. But, in the previous work, we also excluded spillover as an explanation of the slow process. This resulted mainly from a comparison of the adsorption rates of oxygen and hydrogen during the slow process. These rates were found to be almost equal: as spillover involves a diffusion process at the surface of alumina, and as equal diffusion constants for two such different gases are very unlikely, a diffusion process does not seem to be involved here. It then appears that chlorine is bound to the support, but probably in the immediate vicinity of the metal particles. Similar conclusions have been reached by other workers on similar Rh/AlgOa catalysts [16]. As concerns the exact position of the chlorine, and the form under which it interacts with hydrogen 265 120' 100 3 0 60- 0 0 1 1' 0 B a tf 0 20 0,00 0,20 0,40 0,60 0,80 Fig. 4.

Results obtained on the chlorine-free catalyst (nitrate precursor) still require some comments: indeed, a very important slow adsorption is still observed, but the adsorption heats at low coverage, although exhibiting more 'normal' values, are still significantly higher than on model catalysts. We have seen that chlorine originating from the precursor salt used cannot be completely removed from the support even after several steps of calcination and reduction at high temperature, and is responsible for the majority of the strong and slow adsorptions. In a similar way, we suggest that the slow and medium-strong adsorptions of hydrogen on the Rh catalyst prepared using a nitrate precursor are due to the presence of some residual N0^ on the surface. Further work is needed to check this hypothesis. Acknowledgements The authors thank Johnson Matthey PLC for the loan of rhodium nitrate. Thanks are also due to Mr. G.

        "dc:description": "Supported catalysts containing chlorine originating from the precursor salt used in preparation have been shown previously to exhibit two features towards hydrogen adsorption not found in model catalysts: (1) a very important slow adsorption (2) a very high heat of adsorption at low coverage (strong adsorption). In the present paper, the adsorption of hydrogen is studied on two Rh/Al2O3 chlorine-free catalysts: one prepared using Rh(NO3)3 as precursor; the second one, a previously studied catalyst that has been dechlorinated. It is shown here that both slow and strong adsorption is due mainly to the presence of chlorine.",
