Effects of type of support, method of preparation and conditions of use of Ru/Ti02 catalysts on their behaviour in n-butane hydrogenolysis Geoffrey C. Bond, Raj. R. Rajaram and Rosiyah Yahya Departmeat of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH (iJ.K) (Received February 18, 1991; revised April 25, 1991) Abstract Progress in developing theoretical models to describe the behaviour of supported metal catalysts requires experimental measurements of the highest reliability on structuresensitive reactions, with a full record of the catalysts' history (preparation, pretreatment etc.). The study of Ru/Ti02 catalysts derived from RuC13, and subjected to both lowand high-temperature reductions, constitutes a rigorous test of experimental control. Depending on the precise schedule and sequence of the pretreatments, Ru particles may either (a) be contaminated by Cl-, (b) suffer from either a partial or complete SMSI or (c) be relatively clean. Each state shows a characteristic range of activities and selectivities for the test reaction (n-butane hydrogenolysis); isothermal (433 K) rates vary by more than 106, and contaminated surfaces give high ethane selectivities (> 1.3). The variability of Ru/Ti02 catalysts containing 0.1-59o Ru prepared on a small scale by various workers over a period of time is assessed with respect to these kinetic parameters. Rates vary considerably, especially after high-temperature reductions (HTR); selectivities are less variable. Oxidation and low-temperature (433 K) reduction after HTR gives more uniform products. Differences in rate are not accounted for by variations in dispersion, because HZ chemisorption does not accurately count the number of active sites, especially when the surface is contaminated. Repeat preparations by a single operator with the same starting materials can however afford closely-reproducible products. Varying the acidity of the RuC13 solution used for impregnation or the crystal structure of the support is without major effect; calcining the RuCl3/Ti02 precursor before the first HTR has a marked influence, as the Cl- concentration is thereby lowered. One catalyst made by ion exchange using [Ru(NH3)gls+ was almost inactive for hydrogenolysis, but showed activity for dehydrogenation and isomerisation. Catalysts made by impregnation lose up to 60g'o of their initial activity and thereafter are perfectly stable; deactivation causes only small changes in product selectivities. Introduction Study of the catalytic properties of metals in a finely divided state poses a number of difficulties. For practical purposes, the very small particles must be deposited on a support to give them thermal stability, and it is best for fundamental studies if the support is catalytically inert. However, metal particles comprising only a few tens or hundreds of atoms are much more reactive and flexible than bulk structures, and so their precise surface condition 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 360 during a catalytic test will be a function, inter alia, of the chemical nature of the support, its physical characteristics and chemical purity, the metal precursor and preparative method used and the pretreatment applied. Exactly how these variables exert their influence is difficult to specify in our present state of understanding, but the structure of the metal-support interface, the electron concentration in the metal particles, the mean particle size, size distribution and shape, surface roughness and cleanliness are all factors which have been implicated in determining the metal's catalytic performance. Of course when deliberately-added promoters or modifiers are present, there are additional factors that can influence catalytic behaviour [ 1 J. Identifying the precise role of each of the above factors will call for the most sophisticated physical in situ characterisation, performed on a number of catalysts, and with a range of catalytic reactions under a variety of conditions. This paper concentrates on one small facet of the problem, namely, that of defining the variables of catalyst preparation, of pretreatment and of test conditions that need to be considered. We have over recent years performed a significant body of work on the Ru/Ti02 system, much of which has been published [2-5]. However, we have not previously compared the almost universally used Degussa P-25 Ti02 with other types of Ti02: we now report results obtained with Eurotitania and a Tioxide rutile. We have usually prepared our catalysts by impregnation of the support to incipient wetness with an aqueous RuC13 solution; we now show the effect of varying the acidity of the solution, and present some results obtained on materials formed by ion exchange with [Ru(NH3)s]3+ solution. The cardinal principle of scientific research is that it should be reported in sufficient detail that a competent worker will be able to repeat it. Nowhere is it more important than in the field of heterogeneous catalysis for experimental procedures to be fully described; only in this way can the influence of methods of catalyst preparation, activation and use be adequately evaluated. The literature abounds with apparently contradictory results, although each is probably valid within its own (often ill-defined) context. In our experience with structure-sensitive reactions in continuous-flow systems, it is difficult to reproduce rates with samples from a given batch of precursor to better than a factor of two or three at best. We must suppose that this variance is due to differences in active metal area after reduction, and we suspect that inhomogeneity in metal content is a contributory factor, but it is hardly practicable to analyse each sample after use for metal content and dispersion, however desirable this may be. As we shall see, batch-to-batch variation in rate for catalysts prepared on a small scale is even less satisfactory, due to the problem of controlling adequately all facets of the procedure. Product selectivities, and sometimes even activation energies, are however somewhat easier to reproduce than rates. In this survey, therefore, we shall need to examine how each aspect of the results is influenced by the variables of the experiment. We make no apologies for stressing these seemingly trivial considerations, because we believe that knowledge of the reliability of experimental results 361 is crucial to the rate of scientific progress. Very few published papers indicate the sample-to-sample or batch-to-batch reproducibility of the catalysts they describe, and hence it is sometimes difficult to judge whether the effect of the major variable significantly exceeds random and uncontrolled fluctuations in the measured parameters. In this paper, we also stress the need to describe fully the conditions under which the measurements are made, so that possible complicating factors such as mass-transport effects and deactivation on rates and product selectivities can be recognised and if necessary allowed for. When studying published work, we are often exercised to know whether reported activities and products relate to an initial state of the catalyst or to some partially deactivated state, and are concerned to see the very large standard deviations which are sometimes assigned to activation energies. Our results have been obtained over a period of time, with two quite difference pieces of equipment, and will demonstrate the size and scope of the problem with the Ru/Ti02 system. Our experience with it [2-5] has led us to employ routinely three standard pretreatments, designated HTRI, LTR (preceded by an oxidation) and HTR2; details are given below. These procedures result in vastly different rates and TOFs. The first gives moderate rates, characteristic of a surface partially poisoned by Cl-; the second gives very fast rates, and the third very slow rates, because the catalyst is then in the SMSI state. HTR1 does not produce this, because access to it is inhibited by Cl-. Our task is rendered the more taxing in that we are aiming to reproduce three levels of activity, rather than simply one, as well as three activation energies and three sets of product selectivities. We will demonstrate the quality of the results we can now obtain, and in a further paper we intend to explore how dispersion, rate and TOF are influenced by Ru content. Experimental Preparation anal pretreatment of catalysts Most of the catalysts used in this work were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (Imp) of the support by an aqueous solution of RuC13-2H2O, followed by drying in a hot-air oven overnight at -400 K. In one series of preparations (see Table 6), the RuC13 solution was rendered more acidic by means of 359'o aqueous HCI. Two catalysts (designated RR3 and RY4) were prepared by ion exchange (IE) of Ti02 (Degussa P-25) with an 0.01 M aqueous solution of [Ru(NH3)61C13, following the method of Resasco and Haller [6, 7]. The Ru salts were obtained on loan from the Johnson Matthey Technology Centre. Catalysts identified by the letters XY are those described in [2 ]; SF3 features in [ 8 ] . Degussa P-25 Ti02 (^ 80% anatase, ^- 55 m2 g-') was used as the support in all preparations except three. Those designated RR24 and 25 employed Eurotitania ( ^- 90% anatase, 45.5 m2 g-'), while RR30 was prepared with CLD 2008 (90O rutile, 52 mz g-'), both supplied by Tioxide International 362 plc. These supports are denoted by the letters E and R respectively in the tables. A standard sequence of pretreatments was applied in the majority of cases. HTR1 comprised overnight (16 h) reduction in HZ at 758 K; after activity measurements, the sample was then oxidised in air (623 K, I h) and reduced in HZ (433 K, 1 h: LTR); after further activity measurements it was again reduced at 758 K (HTR2) and a final set of rates measured. In one instance (see Table 4), we followed previous practice [2, 31 by performing a series of experiments using 893 K for the high-temperature reductions: the pretreatments are then designated HTR3, LTR2 and HTR4. Latterly, using improved apparatus, we have controlled heating, cooling and gas-flow rates during the pretreatment schedules in an attempt to improve reproducibility of results: for details, see [ 7 ]. Other modifications to the standard procedure will be noted as they are encountered. Catalyst characterisation The Ru content of a number of the catalyst precursors was estimated by Soxhlet extraction using 35% HCl for 48 h, followed either by AAS or spectrophotometric determination employing the thiourea complex [9]. In many cases, the Ru dispersion was estimated by selective HZ chemisorption in a volumetric apparatus, following pretreatments, in a flow-through reactor, closely imitating those employed before the catalytic measurements [7]. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was then heated in vacuum at 10 K min' to 573 K and evacuated for 1 h; after again cooling to room temperature, the HZ isotherm was measured up to an equilibrium pressure of about 6 kPa. Results are reported as HIRu ratios. Transnussion electron microscopy was performed on selected samples, using a JEOL 100 CX instrument; samples after pretreatment were ground, suspended in acetone with ultrasonic agitation and mounted on a carboncoated grid. Measurt of catalytic activity Measurements were made in continuous-flow mode at atmospheric pressure: the standard reactant flow contained n-butane:H2:N2 in the ratio 1:10:3, the total flow-rate being normally 140 cm3 min-'. In one series of experiments (see Figs. 4 and 5), the flow-rate was varied without altering the composition. Sample weights were usually - 0.2 g, but with NV5 (see Table 2) the catalyst (0.12 g) was diluted by admixture with the support. Rates and product compositions were normally measured at about 10 K intervals in the rising-temperature mode; the range was selected to try to maintain the conversion between - 0.1 and 10%, although of necessity results obtained at higher conversions will sometimes need to be quoted. The improved apparatus mentioned above was however able to give accurate product information at conversions as low as 0.02%. Other facets of our experimental procedures are described in Part 2 of this series [ 101, and elsewhere [ 7 ]. Our experience with Ru catalysts shows that deactivation is not a serious 363 problem, but to confirm this, two series of experiments were performed in which the temperature was twice raised and lowered over a range of - 60 K, as described previously [ 11 ] (see Table 7). Rates of reactant removal are expressed as mmol gR -' h-' and relate to 433 K (unless otherwise stated); they are obtained from the quoted Arrhenius parameters. The temperature ranges given in the Tables are those over which the Arrhenius plots are satisfactorily linear (R > 0.99), but 433 K does not always lie within the quoted range. Selectivities vary both with temperature and with conversion, and to be able to give them at conversions less than 10ss'o it is necessary to adopt different reference temperatures. Thus for example for catalysts showing high activities after LTR, selectivities are given for 403 K, while the lower activities shown after HTR1 and HTR2 allow 433 K to be used as the reference point. This procedure makes comparisons more difficult, but is preferred to extensive quoting of results at high conversion. The reference temperature almost always falls within the measured range, but on occasion graphical extrapolation has been used, but very rarely over more than 10 K. The tabulated information will make it quite clear when this has been done. Product selectivities are defined as follows. If cj is the number of moles of product containing j carbon atoms, the number of moles of n-butane reacted is given by: A = (c, + 2C2 + 3c3) /4 and the selectivity Sj for that product is: Sj=Cj/A Thus: S1+2Sz+3S3=4 and values of SZ and S3 are sufficient to define product composition. On very rare occasions, isobutane was detected as a product; the isomerisation selectivity Si is then defined simply as the fraction of n-butane converted to isobutane. Above 633 K, the less active catalysts (Table 5) also formed the 2-butenes by dehydrogenation, but they were not sufficiently well separated from the n-butane peak to make quantitative analysis possible. As before [2-41, we have employed the formalism of the Kempling-Anderson reaction scheme [ 12 ] to interpret the product selectivities. Briefly summarised, this is a rake mechanism in which adsorbed C4, C3, CZ and C, species participate, each being in dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding alkane. The C3 and CZ species may either desorb or undergo further cracking at rates proportional respectively to kj' and kj* (j = 2 or 3). Then Tj = kj' /(kj' + kj*) and the parameterFgives the probability of the adsorbed C4 species undergoing central (as opposed to terminal) bond fission. At low conversions: 364 S2 1T2 = 1 +F-S3 and T3- S3/0 -F) These equations cannot be solved unambiguously, and so we arbitrarily set TZ equal to unity: the justification for this has been considered previously [3], and the values of F and T3 so derived are denoted by primes. Under certain conditions the values of F' and T3' are sensitively dependent on those of SZ and S3; thus with the last two entries of Table 7, changes in S3 and S3 of about 0.02 lead to a change in F' by almost a factor of two. It is therefore worth checking to see that selectivity differences are indeed significant. Results Chemical and physical characterisation Estimates of the Ru concentrations for a number of the catalysts used in this work are given in Table 1; they represent about 909'0 of the nominal content, irrespective of its value. Accurate measurement of the actual metal loading of laboratory-prepared samples is not easy, but is needed for estimating dispersion: it probably constitutes the limit to the accuracy with which dispersions can be measured. Table 1 also shows values for H/Ru ratios determined (by linear extrapolation of the isotherm to zero pressure) after the various pretreatments. We have previously noted [2, 4] that the presence of residual CI- after HTR1 interferes with Hz chemisorption, this being TABLE 1 Estimates of dispersion of Ru/Ti02 catalysts after various pretreatments Code Support Nominal g'o Ru Actual 4'o Ru H/Ru HTRl LTR HTR2 RR2 P-25 0.1 0.09 0.27 0.84 0.24 RR3 P-25 0.1 0.09 0.26 0.95 0.19 RR25 E 0.1 - 0.04 0.51 0 RR1 P-25 0.5 0.44 0.15 0.62 0.11 RRla P-25 0.5 0.44 0.07 0.75 0 RY13 b P-25 1.0 0.88 - 0.62 ^-1.0 - 0.17 RR23 P-25 1.0 0.96 0.16 0.50 0.11 RR4 P-25 5.0 4.77 0.12 0.52 0.07 RY5 P-25 5.0 - - 0.27 - 0.62 ^- 0.14 RR24 E 5.0 - 0.13 0.55 0.07 'Precursor calcined (16 h at 673 K) before HTR1. 'Estimated on basis of TEM mean particle size. 365 detectable by the shape of the isotherm (particularly the slope in the plateau region) and by the extrapolated H/Ru ratio. These ratios are therefore much lower than expected on the basis of particle size (see Table 1 and [2]), presumably because much of the Ru surface is covered by Cl-: they may however give an approximate idea of the surface area available for catalysis. Dispersions between 0.5 and unity are encountered after LTR, and these are felt to be more accurate, but even here there is some discrepancy between the TEM and HZ chemisorption results. After HTR2, when catalysts are partially or completely in the SMSI state, the H/Ru ratio at the lower loadings depends on both the kind of support and the earlier pretreatment; HTR2 also seems to effect some degree of sintering. Because of these various complications, we do not propose to express our rates as turnover frequencies in this paper. Subsequent Tables will reveal further information on the origin of the catalysts listed in Table 1 (support, method of preparation etc). No hydrogenolysis results are available for RR4. Catalysts prepared with Degussa P-25 and other types of Ti02 Tables 2 and 3 give the Arrhenius parameters, rates and product selectivities for a number of Ru/Ti02 catalysts prepared over a period of time by different workers; they contain nominal Ru loadings of 5 and lO by weight, and the results were obtained after the standard pretreatments. For the various preparations employing Degussa P-25 Ti02, rates per g Ru show divergences from the mean which are generally not more than a factor of two or three, the results for the 1% Ru/Ti02s being more tightly grouped. Arrhenius plots depart from linearity above conversions which are sometimes as low as 3% and sometimes as high as 30%, the point of departure depending on both the Ru content and the kind of pretreatment. Activation energies are usually lower after LTR than after the HTRs, as we have seen before [ 3 ], and product distributions are characterised by lower values of the splitting parameter F' [2-4]. It is possible to detect a relationship between the values of F' and T3' at constant temperature [8], and the plot of one against the other (Fig. 1) serves to distinguish the results of the LTR treatments from those of the HTRs, and to emphasise the closer grouping of the former. These plots also contain points for catalysts having 0.1 and 0.5% nominal Ru contents (Tables 4 and 5), to indicate the generality of the trends. The location of the points is displaced upwards if 403 K is used as the reference temperature instead of 433 K, because T3' decreases steadily with temperature while F is almost temperature-independent (see Fig. 2) in the range where the assumption that T2 can be taken as unity is reasonably valid. Against this background, we can judge the effects of variations from standard conditions of catalyst composition, preparation and activation. The 5% Ru/Ti02 catalysts made with Eurotitania and with rutile give higher rates after HTRl, and high activation energies (Table 2). With these exceptions, their kinetic and selectivity parameters fall within the normal range, showing that the crystal structure of the support is not of great importance.

The principal line is the same as that in Fig. 3. dispersions are found for both the P-25 and Eurotitania supports (Table 1), so differences in rates (Table 2) are unlikely to be due simply to differences in active areas. 1% Ru/TiOz catalysts prepared by impregnation with solutions of different acidity Having recognised [2-41 that the residual Cl- content largely determines the behaviour of a Ru/Ti02 catalyst after HTR1, we decided to vary the acidity of the impregnating solution by adding more HCI, in order to exaggerate the minor fluctuations which might occur in the Cl- content of RuCl3 solutions from one preparation to another. 196 Ru/Ti02 catalysts were therefore prepared from RuC13 solutions which were made 0.77, 3.85 and 5.12 M in HCl; their behaviour was compared with the standard catalyst (RY13) for which no HCl had been added to the impregnating solution. Results for rates and product selectivities are shown in Table 6. Dispersions vary little with acidity, being slightly higher after LTR (0.16-0.19) than after HTRl (0.13-0.19) and lower after HTR2 (0.05-0.07). Rates after HTR1 vary only in the range 880-1070 mmol gR -' h-', and after LTR are constant at the higher acidities (3125 t 25 mmol gR -' h-'). Rates after HTR2 are much lower and more variable; dispersions do not account fully for the differences. Activation energies show no consistent trends with acidity, and after LTR the values are very similar (122-127 kJ mol-'). Product selectivities are not much affected by acidity either; each pretreatment gives a knot of tightly-bunched points on a F'-T3' plot (Fig. 3), and it is evident that adding extra HCl to the impregnating solution has no significant effect on the TABLE 4 Hydrogenolysis of n-butane on 0.5% Ru/Ti02 catalyst (code RR1): effect of varying pretreatment conditions Pretreatment' Temp, range E In Ab Rate' SZ S3'' F' T3' (K) (kJ mol -') HTR1 423-463 133 38.3 59 1.23 0.29 0.52 0.60 HTR2 433-483 145 41.0 12 0.97 0.19 0.16 0.23 HTR3 433-473 146 44.3 42 1.05 0.34 0.39 0.56 HTR4 433-473 149 43.7 11 1.01 0.35 0.36 0.55 LTR1 383-433 106 34.9 1380 0.70 0.44 0.14 0.51 LTR2 393-433 108 37.3 1540 0.63 0.47 0.10 0.52 HTRl' 453-493 97 31.1 71 0.89 0.20 0.09 0.22 LTR' 403-443 124 42.0 1910 0.72 0.44 0.16 0.52 HTR2' 533-573 165 41.7 0.01 1.24 0.17 0.41 0.29 LTR\" 383-423 120 40.7 1840 0.65 0.46 0.11 0.52 HTR2\" 453-493 131 38.4 8 0.95 0.30 0.25 0.40 'HTRl and 2 at 758 K; HTR3 and 4 at ss93K.

The maximum effect in the first phase of the reaction, attributable to Cl-, is effected by that present in the solution of RuC13 itself. Efect of varying the standard pretreatnnents The observation that, with the Ru/Ti02 system, rates of alkane hydrogenolysis and product selectivities are greatly dependent upon the type of pretreatment used [2-4, 81 has prompted us to investigate exactly how sensitive the results are to the precise conditions employed. Because of the large number of variables (temperature, time, H2 concentration etc.) which apply in each of the three steps, it has only been possible to study certain limited aspects. A selection of the results is shown in Table 4. In our early work [ 2 we used three different temperatures for the HTR stages, viz. 623, 758 and 893 K. The lowest of these has not been used subsequently, and 758 K has been taken as the standard temperature for HTR. We have however made further measurements with an 0.5% Ru/TiOz catalyst using 893 K for HTR and these are given in Table 4. Thus the following sequences of treatments were applied to different samples: HTRI - LTR1 - HTR2 (HTR at 758 K) HTR3 - LTR2 - HTR4 (HTR at 893 K) The conditions for LTR2 were as for LTRl. We therefore look at the results to see whether the use of the higher temperature induces a deeper state of SMSI, and whether it can still be recovered by a second oxidation and LTR. There is little difference in the Arrhenius parameters after the four HTRs, and the rates vary by only a factor of - 5, the slowest rates being after HTR2 and HTR4. Product selectivities do however differ.

(p) RY14; (O) NVl; other symbols as in Fig. 1. F' after HTR1 (-0.5) is characteristic of a surface poisoned by Cl- [2]; HTR2 at 758 K does not fully reverse the effect of oxidation and LTR in lowering F'. Reduction at 893 K (HTR3) leads to selectivities more characteristic of the SMSI state, the higher temperature more effectively removing Cl-. Oxidation and LTR gives high activity, but a second HTR (i.e. HTR4) closely reproduces the results of HTR3. Oxidation for 1 h at 623 K, following HTR1, was deemed sufficient to oxidise the metal fully to Ru02 [2] and to remove much if not all the Cl-. We have however checked this by oxidising for 2 h after a standard HTR1; after 1 h reduction at 433 K (designated LTR\"), the results (see Table 4) are very similar to those found with the standard 1 h oxidation, as are those for the subsequent HTR (designated HTR\"), confirming that oxidation for 1 h is sufficient. Finally we have had to examine the effect of calcining the RuC13/Ti02 precursor (523 K, 1 h in air) before the first HTR; this was in consequence of the procedure adopted [4, 10] for introducing, modifiers needing to be decomposed by oxidation. The results of the subsequent pretreatments (distinguished by single primes) are shown in Table 4. After HTR1', the rate and selectivities are reminiscent of those usually found after HTR2, and the dispersion is low (Table 1); this is due presumably to the removal of most of the Cl- in the calcination and the consequential partial entry into the SMSI state. The results following LTR' are normal for this pretreatment, i.e. the SMSI condition is cancelled, but HTR2' gives an exceedingly low rate characteristic of a catalyst in which the Ru particles are almost totally 374 encapsulated by TiOx. The combination of the prior calcination and the oxidation before LTR are clearly more effective in achieving a full SMSI state than the latter alone. Comparison of impregnation and ion exchange methods of catalyst preparation Cation exchange of protons held at the surface of a support for ammine complexes of the active metal is a well-established route to preparing highlydispersed metals [6]; unfortunately the exchange capacity of Ti02 is limited, and exchange of Degussa P-25 with [Ru(NH3)613+ ions gave a product containing only 0.09% Ru. This, after washing and drying, was the precursor to RR2; RY4 was prepared similarly, but part was thermally decomposed (N2, 4 h at 623 K) before the first HTR (designated D-HTR1'D. Subsequent oxidation and LTR of this sample is designated D-LTR\". RR3 and RR25 were prepared conventionally with RuC13 solution and respectively P-25 and Eurotitania supports. The results are given in Table 5. The catalysts made by impregnation show, after HTR 1, the behaviour we have come to associate with a Cl--contaminated surface. Unfortunately the two catalysts made by ion exchange do not behave in exactly the same way. RY4 resembles RR2 rather than RR3, so it may be presumed that not all the Cl- ions adhering to the catalyst after ion exchange were removed during HTR1. RR3 is however much less active, and is clearly poisoned to the extent that skeletal isomerisation becomes a recognisable process (Si = 0.12 at 678 K), although we cannot be sure whether this is due to SMSI (as seems probable) or to excessive Cl-. Prior decomposition of the [Ru(NH3)61C13 in N2, which we expected to cause loss of the Cl- as NH,CI and reduction of the Ru to Ru(0), gives a catalyst of low activity, having product selectivities reminiscent of those normally found after HTR2 (see Tables 2 and 3). We think this procedure leads to a catalyst largely in the SMSI state; we have previously [2-4] expressed the belief that Cl- on the support inhibits H spillover and hence limits access to the SMSI condition. In all cases, oxidation and LTR leads to much greater but variable activities, and to selectivities characteristic of this pretreatment. HTR2 gives catalysts of very low activities, immeasurably so in the case of RY4, although RR2 and RR3 show activity for isomerisation only above ^- 600 K (rates - 5-10 mmol gR -' h-' at 633 K). Where the activities are so low, the kinetic parameters are of limited reliability and axe not quoted. Butenes are formed by dehydrogenation with both catalysts after HTR2, and with RR3 after HTR1, above 633 K. Thus for example in the latter case at 678 K, where Si was - 0.7, the butenes are about six times more abundant than isobutane. Effect of varying contact time on conversion and product selectivities In examining the effect of temperature on rates and product selectivities, we have of necessity to scan over a range of conversion. With our current equipment, we usually retain only results obtained between - 0.02 and 10% 375 conversion, since below 0.02ss'o the analysis becomes of limited accuracy and above 10% we fear that sequential reaction of primary products will become important. It is however necessary on occasion to quote results at much higher conversion (25-30%) in order to permit comparison between different catalysts at the same temperature. We have therefore looked at the effect of contact time variation with catalyst RY13 (1% Ru/Ti02) to evaluate in particular how quickly product selectivities change with conversion. The results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows the variation of conversion with contact time after each of the three pretreatments; good linear plots are obtained up to - 12ss'o conversion. Figure 5 shows how product selectivities change. We would expect S3 to decrease, and S1 and SZ to increase, with increasing conversion in the range covered, and this is indeed observed, but even the selectivities at ^-12% conversion differ from those extrapolated to zero conversion by no more than 0.02. We therefore conclude that comparison of results obtained by varying temperature is valid to within these limits if the conversion does not exceed 10%; the greater the conversion above this figure, the more caution must be exercised in interpretation. Effect of variation of stage number In all of the work described thus far, and indeed with all our previous work on Ru catalysts, the results have been obtained in a single risingtemperature stage, the effluent gas being sampled for analysis after a short (- 18 min) isothermal period, immediately before the temperature was raised to the next value. In our study of Pt/A1203 catalysts [ 111, we found significant changes, not only in rate but also in product selectivities, when the direction of the temperature change was reversed (stage 2): no further changes in the latter were seen on repeating the cycle, although further deactivation occurred. We therefore felt it was important to see whether the results 125 }0 HTR 1 0-97 LTR ' 101 NTR2 2 1 O 1 10 l07 095 099 059 1 2 092 ~75 O 2 c _ ~' 090 ...

The second line in each group gives the average over stages 2, 3 and 4 of the quantities measured. 377 obtained for Ru catalysts in a single rising-temperature mode (stage 1) were changed in later stages through exposure to reaction at high temperature. Experiments were performed with RY14, prepared by using an RuC13 solution made 0.77 M in HCl; the other (NVl) was a standard 1% Ru/Ti02 (P-25). The results (Table 7) are easily summarised, although the two catalysts behaved slightly differently. With RY14, rates at 433 K in stage 2 are 40-50/0 of those in stage 1; thereafter deactivation is very slight, and the Table therefore gives only the rates for stage 1 and the average of the rates for stages 2 to 4. With NVl there is hardly any deactivation at all. With RY14 there are small changes in product selectivities from stage 1 to stage 2, but these are not progressive; the Table records the values in stage 1 and the average of the later stages. The results for NV I are shown in the same way, but here the differences are generally smaller. Other standard catalysts containing 5 and 10ss'o Ru have recently been examined, and they also show little if any change in behaviour with stage number. In summary we may say that catalysts prepared with acidified RUC13 solutions experience some initial deactivation and slight change in product composition, while those made with non-acidified RuC13 solutions show very little change. The high hydrogenolysis activity of Ru appears to prevent massive carbon deposition. It is interesting to note that, while these two catalysts show somewhat different product selectivities after HTR1, the differences are much less after oxidation and LTR, but re-appear after HTR2. Discussion Variability of rates, kinetic parameters and selectivities The purpose of this paper is to assemble and analyse results obtained by a number of workers over a period of about ten years, with a view to establishing the variability of kinetic parameters, including product selectivities, which occurs when standard procedures of catalyst preparation are replicated. It is a further object to identify possible sources of error, uncertainty or irreproducibility in the preparation, pretreatment and use of members of a catalyst family. These considerations are motivated by the conviction that progress in theoretical understanding of the behaviour of supported metals requires experimental observations of a high order of reliability. Tables 1, 2, 3 and 5 contain information on batch-to-batch reproducibility of the behaviour of Ru/Ti02 catalysts containing 0.1-5% Ru. On the basis of limited information, it appears that dispersions are reasonably reproducible (Table 1), rather more so than rates (Tables 2, 3 and 5). Rates following HTR1 are somewhat variable, as are product selectivities and the derived Kempling-Anderson parameters (see Mg. 1), but this is not surprising as we think the catalysts are then substantially affected by Cl-, to an extent which may depend sensitively on procedures used during preparation and pretreatment. The degree of variability in all kinetic parameters is much reduced by oxidation and LTR, as this removes most of the Cl- and re- 378 forms the metal particles by reduction of the oxide: more uniform catalysts result thereby. Variation is however again introduced by HTR2, where the extent to which the SMSI operates is affected critically by operating conditions. When however a series of closely similar catalysts is prepared from the same materials and by the same operator (see Table 6 and Fig. 3), a very pleasing degree of consistency is found with respect to all kinetic parameters. The task of accurately reproducing catalyst preparations on a small scale is therefore not an impossible one. As we noted in the Introduction, our standard sequence of treatments produces catalysts in three very different states, thus giving us three points of reference rather than the usual one. Although our skill in reproducing catalyst behaviour still leaves much to be desired, our new results amply confirm the large changes in activity, and the smaller changes in selectivities, produced by the HTR1, LTR and HTR2 pretreatments [2-41. We have previously shown [8] that the values of the Kempling-Anderson parameters appear to be linked, in the sense that high values of T3' are associated with high values of F' and vice versa. The extensive collection of results shown in Fig. 1 offers some confirmation of this view, but it is even more clearly supported by the results in Fig. 3 which pertain only to catalysts prepared with RUC13 solutions of various acidities (Table 6) and to the catalysts NVl and RY14 examined at various stages of a thermal cycling sequence (Table 7). The theoretical basis for a connection between F' and T3' is however unclear. We have shown that the rate constants k3' and k3* obey the Arrhenius law, since an activation energy difference AE=E3'-E3* can be derived from the temperature dependence of T3' [2, 3, 71. The value of T3' at a given temperature therefore depends on the constants in the Arrhenius equations for k3' and k3* (and on the true value of TZ); but how these are geared to F' remains uncertain. We have recognised a clear tendency for high values of F' to be associated with contaminated surfaces [2, 8]. The RY series of catalysts (Tables 6 and 7, and Fig. 3) demonstrate this most clearly. After HTR1, F' is 0.4 to 0.5 (SZ=1.0 to 1.1); we take this to characterise a C1 --poisoned surface. After HTR2, F is - 0.3 (SZ = 0.4); this epitomises a surface in the SMSI state. For essentially clean surfaces, e.g. after LTR, F' is - 0.2. Thus the value of F' gives a first approximate indication of the cleanliness of the Ru surface. For example, calcination before HTRl, removing Cl-, produces a value of F' of only - 0.1 (Table 4). Very high values of F' (> 0.6; SZ > 1.35, see Table 5) are obtained with catalysts having only 0.1ss'o Ru and showing extremely low activities, denoting surfaces heavily poisoned by TiO,. We cannot be sure whether the elevation of F' has a steric origin, i.e. whether the n-butane molecule is constrained to adsorb in a structure favouring central bond fission, or whether the contaminants exercise an electronic influence on the remaining free sites, so encouraging adsorption at the midpoints of the molecule. A further consideration, which we have discussed in relation to the Pt and Pt-Re system [ 11 ], and also the Ru-VO., system [8], is whether contaminants block all types of surface atoms indifferently. 379 Selective inactivation of certain classes of surfaces atom, e.g. those of high coordination number in low-index planes, is an alternative basis for interpreting the changes of F' with surface purity, but this hypothesis requires sites comprised of atoms of different class to demonstrate different modes of adsorption of the n-butane molecule [ 11 ]. The efect of variables in the catalyst preparation Some of the variable factors in the preparation of Ru/Ti02 catalysts can be disposed of quickly. The phase composition of the support is of little relevance (Tables 1 and 5), although the anatase (E) and rutile (R) supports produce somewhat higher activities than does the Degussa P-25. The acidity of the RuC13 solution used for impregnation is likewise unimportant (Table 6): the CI- attached to the Ru3+ ions is sufficient to create the maximum toxic effect. Catalysts containing only 0.1 g'o Ru are of greatest interest, but suffer from greatest lack of reproducibility (Table 5). The catalyst RR3, prepared by ion exchange, is very inactive after HTR 1; it is the only preparation to have given significant amounts of isobutane (S = 0.12 at 678 K) and even more dehydrogenation. Resasco and Haller [6J have had similar experience with Rh/Ti02 and Ir/TiOz catalysts prepared by ion exchange. We conclude that the Cl- is removed as NH,C1 during the reductions, and that the catalysts then immediately enter the SMSI state. There is thus every prospect of being able to develop a Ru dehydrogenation and isomerisation catalyst that might well challenge the long-established Pt/A1203 catalysts. A standard oxidation and LTR reverses the SMSI effect, and gives a catalyst of moderate activity with a product distribution characteristic of a clean surface. Unfortunately RY4 did not reproduce the very low activity of RR3, presumably because the Cl - was still present to inhibit H spillover, but it is not clear why this should be so. RY4, and the 0.1ss'o Ru catalysts made by impregnation, show (Table 5) the very high values of SZ and of F' which betoken a heavily contaminated surface. Effect of varying the standard pretreatment conditions We have examined several facets of the pretreatment schedules to determine how critically they affect catalytic properties. The 1 h period of oxidation at 623 K preceding the LTR seems to be quite sufficient to oxidise and disperse the Ru particles, as doubling the time is without further effect (Table 4). Carrying out reductions at 893 K instead of 658 K leaves a small fraction of active metal, although the product selectivities are characteristic of the SMSI state (Table 4). Calcining the RuCl3/Ti02 precursor before the first reduction (HTRl', Table 4) presumably converts the RuC13 to RU02 and removes much of the Cl- from the catalyst; this leads to a catalyst showing unusually low values of both F' and T3'. Our experience with this pretreatment sequence suggests [4] that HTR of the oxide formed directed from RuC13 does not give Ru particles equivalent to those made by reducing Ru02 (formed by oxidation of the metal) in LTR or to particles made by annealing those 380 created in LTR in a further HTR. However LTR' gives a normal product, but the final HTR2' leads to exceptionally low activity. Removal of Clintroduced in the course of ion exchange by decomposing the ammine complex in NZ before the first HTR (i.e. D-HTR1\", Table 5) allows immediate access to the SMSI state, from which as usual recovery by oxidation and LTR is readily possible. Efect of altering conditions of catalytic measurements Changing the reaction temperature of necessity affects the conversion, and it is as well to check that this does not per se affect the product distribution. The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate an absence of mass-transport complication, and a lack of any serious effect on selectivities. The latter do of course change in the expected sense, but values taken at up to 10% conversion differ from those extrapolated to zero by no more than 0.02. Of greater potential significance are the changes which may occur because of deactivation. We have used a procedure of raising temperature stepwise to 505-520 K to accelerate deactivation; at these temperatures, conversions are between 30 and 75%. Cooling permits re-measurement of rate at the standard 433 K, and the thermal cycling is then repeated. The two catalysts subjected to this treatment (Table 7) behave slightly differently; with RY14, an activity loss of 50-60% is caused by the first high-temperature excursion, but this is accompanied by only small changes in selectivities, affecting mainly T3'. No further changes occur after a second high-temperature treatment. NV1 behaved similarly, but deactivation was smaller (0-300) and changes in selectivity were slight. In both cases, the catalysts pretreated by HTR2 showed the biggest effects. Thus the formation of carbonaceous residues responsible for the deactivation do not selectively block any particular class or surface site and are therefore without major effect on selectivities and the Kempling-Anderson parameters. In this respect, therefore, Ru behaves quite differently from Pt [11]. Conclusions Most of the numerous variable parameters which attend the laboratoryscale preparation of supported metal catalysts affect the product's physical structure, chemical composition and activity for structure-sensitive reactions, in ways which are not yet wholly explicable. Small-scale preparations are not easily reproduced, and detailed kinetic studies are probably best conducted on catalysts made on a larger scale, i.e. either industrially or for a reference catalyst project (e.g. EUROPT-1). A case can therefore be made for there being available a much wider range of reference catalysts, selected to meet the needs of the academic community. 381 Acknowledgements We are grateful to the Science and Engineering Research Council for supporting the work of R.

The variability of Ru/TiO2 catalysts containing 0.1–5% Ru prepared on a small scale by various workers over a period of time is assessed with respect to these kinetic parameters. Rates vary considerably, especially after high-temperature reductions (HTR); selectivities are less variable. Oxidation and low-temperature (433 K) reduction after HTR gives more uniform products. Differences in rate are not accounted for by variations in dispersion, because H2 chemisorption does not accurately count the number of active sites, especially when the surface is contaminated. Repeat preparations by a single operator with the same starting materials can however afford closely-reproducible products. Varying the acidity of the RuCl3 solution used for impregnation or the crystal structure of the support is without major effect; calcining the RuCl3/TiO2 precursor before the first HTR has a marked influence, as the Cl− concentration is thereby lowered.
