Graphical abstract We study silver-zinc oxide type catalysts with and without the addition of alumina and perform structural analysis and activity tests for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Adding alumina has a dispersing effect on the zinc oxide without structurally altering the silver phase. An alumina-surface enriched ZnO/Al2O3 phase is observed with an increased surface reducibility. Ag/ZnO has a high selectivity towards carbon monoxide (63 ± 12 %) and methane (24 ± 3 %) and low selectivity towards methanol (13 ± 0.5 %). Operando infrared (SSITKA-FTIR) and mass spectrometric product detection indicate methane formation via an adsorbed carbon monoxide (COads) intermediate. The selectivity changes gradually with increasing alumina content, up to 80 ± 3 % toward methanol, and 20 ± 4 % carbon monoxide without methane detection, combined with a tripling of the space time yield to 0.65 ± 0.02mmolMeOH* g c a t - 1 *h−1 at 250 °C and 30bar. Kinetic analysis suggests that the selectivity change originates from hindering the CO-pathway, while the formate pathway leading to methanol remains active.

In the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report, emission mitigation by carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is relied on with “high confidence”, showing the importance of developments in this field, even though at present it is one of the more expensive ways of emission mitigation. [3] One viable way to synthesize renewable synthetic fuels is by valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is usually done via several reaction steps to achieve larger and complex molecules in the desired composition [4]. Methanol is often targeted as intermediate feedstock molecule for a diverse range of chemicals. Since long, methanol is synthesized from syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide, with some addition of carbon dioxide) [5], but many materials are known to also catalyze the hydrogenation of pure carbon dioxide (Eq. (1)) [6]. The main competing reaction pathway is the reverse water–gas-shift (RWGS) leading to carbon monoxide (CO, Eq. (2)). On several catalytic materials, the methanation of carbon dioxide to methane is also observed (Eq. (3)) [7]. Copper-zinc oxide-alumina (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 − CZA) is one of the most promising and most studied catalysts for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction, with an abundant literature present due to several decades of research. [8,9] The details of the reaction mechanism are complex, but the key catalytic steps include dissociative hydrogen adsorption on copper and carbon dioxide chemisorption on the oxide or metal support interface, with the main reaction intermediate towards methanol (MeOH) being formate [6,10]. Due to the complex interplay between copper and zinc at industrially relevant conditions (50–100bar, 200–300 °C) [9], the role of alumina, which is typically added as a minor molar fraction, is often left aside or suggested to being a “structural promotor”. (1) CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 O H + H 2 O (2) CO 2 + H 2 → C O + H 2 O (3) CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O An increasing amount of studies in recent years focused directly on the role of alumina [9]. Widely agreed upon is that alumina helps in the dispersion of the zinc oxide phase [11–13]. This happens mostly by forming a mixed ZnO:Al2O3 phase or solid solution [13–17], although the presence of pure alumina domains is also reported [12,18]. Zinc oxide with low amount of alumina is usually found in the zincite structure [19] through a slight contraction of the unit cell volume [12,15,17,20–22]. The spinel-type ZnAl2O4 is only found at aluminum concentrations above 60 % in the material, as identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). [12] Recent studies indicate that alumina doping has a strong effect on the electronic structure of the semiconducting zinc oxide due to n-type doping [13,20], but further influences are not as clear. While partly the impact of Al3+ doping is ascribed to the “enhanced Cu-ZnO synergy” effect [16,23], several studies speculate the introduction of new oxygen vacancies [15,20] and more defect sites [15,24]. However, Behrens et al. show that these defect sites are not stable under reducing conditions. [13] According to their work, during the reduction step a significant restructuring of the catalyst takes place, where aluminum migrates to the surface of the ZnO:Al2O3 mixed oxide, creating an aluminum-rich surface composition. Along with this reconstruction, the number of defect sites on the surface decreases compared to the pure zinc oxide zincite structure. A possible way to tune the selectivity of CZA catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation towards methanol is to modify the nature of the supported metal [25]. Only a few studies exist where copper is replaced by silver or gold for the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen [26–28]. This might be due to the fact that early studies classified silver-based catalysts as “inactive” [29,30], even though already in the 1990's the interface region between transition metal and metal oxide was identified as the crucial catalytic site instead of the pure transition metal alone. [30,31] Studies on silver-based catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation have been limited to Ag/CeO2 [29] and Ag/ZrO2 [25,27,28,31–33]. Mostly, these studies have compared the catalytic activity with the respective copper counterpart, concluding that silver-based catalysts lead to higher selectivity at lower conversion [28,31,32]. Baiker et al. conclude from FTIR studies that on gold-, silver- and copper-zirconia catalysts methanol is formed via adsorbed carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, while surface formate is leading only to traces of methane [31]. Further studies indicate that silver-addition to copper-based catalysts leads to improved selectivity at similar activity [25,32]. Other studies correlate the activity to the metal dispersion [27,29,33]. In this work, we study the influence of alumina on the carbon dioxide hydrogenation performance of silver-zinc oxide (AZ) based catalysts. Study of the silver-zinc oxide-alumina (AZA) system can help identifying the influences of the ZnO/Al2O3 phase and provide insights into the complex interaction scheme of the general metal/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst type [34,35]. To our knowledge, AZA (with Al2O3/ZnO ratio ≪1) [36] has not been studied so far. We investigate the influence of alumina in the AZA material synthesized by co-precipitation, starting from a Ag/ZnO (AZ) material and gradually adding alumina. Characterization by XRD, nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) lays the foundation for an activity and selectivity investigation under elevated pressure (30 bar) and temperature (250 °C) coupled with product analysis by gas chromatography (GC). Alumina helps to disperse zinc oxide, increasing the catalyst surface area and significantly increasing the selectivity from carbon monoxide and methane towards methanol. The surface reactions are analyzed by operando steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-SSITKA) linking the formation of methane to an adsorbed carbon monoxide (COads) intermediate. Spectral differences between AZ and AZA indicate the strong impact of the oxidic phase on the surface composition under reaction conditions. 2 Results 2.1 Catalyst synthesis and characterization Several catalytic materials with different fractions of silver, zinc oxide and alumina were prepared by co-precipitation from the respective nitrate salts. The molar ratios of Ag/ZnO/Al2O3 (AZA) are: 50/50/0 for catalyst A50Z50, 47/48/5 for catalyst A47Z48A5 and 46/45/9 for catalyst A46Z45A9, confirmed by elemental analysis (Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry, ICP-MS). Further properties are summarized in Tables 1 and S1 and electron microscopy images give an overview of the material morphology (Fig. 1 and S1-S8 ). A50Z50 shows a low surface area of 21 and 14 m2/g after calcination and after reaction, respectively. A50Z50 contains silver crystals with a size above the resolution limit of XRD (>60nm [37], Fig. S9), while the Scherrer-equation indicates zinc oxide grains with an average size value of 23.5 ± 0.5nm. Both these features also show well in the microscopy images. While silver particles identified in the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) microphotographs possess sizes above 100nm (Fig. 1a-c), zinc oxide domains are mostly prolate and have a significantly higher dispersion than silver. The addition of alumina in samples A47Z48A5 and A46Z45A9 does not affect the silver particles (crystal size > 60nm, Fig. S9), but has a dispersive effect on the zinc oxide. The overall surface area more than doubles to A47Z48A5: 56(35) m2/g and A46Z45A9: 47(33) m2/g after calcination (after reaction), respectively. The zinc oxide crystallite size decreases to 8 ± 2nm (A47Z48A5 and A46Z45A9). The diffraction signals of zinc oxide slightly shift towards higher diffraction angles for both A47Z48A5 and A46Z45A9, indicating a small compression of the lattice (Fig.S9). TEM images show a more irregular morphology of the ZnO/Al2O3 particles, and only smaller crystallites can be identified by fast Fourier transform (FFT), in agreement with the XRD-crystal size (Figs. S1-S8). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) mappings show a homogeneous zinc and aluminum distribution on approx.10nm resolution level (Figs. S5 + S8). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the calcined and in situ reduced sample A46Z45A9 (Fig.S10) indicates a facilitated reducibility of the ZnO/Al2O3 mixed oxide compared to the pure zinc oxide phase in A50Z50 (Fig. S10a, O 1s spectra). While the Zn3p signals do not display significant changes, differences are observed in the O 1s and Al 2p. On both samples, the high binding energy (BE) shoulder of the O 1s signal decreases upon in situ reduction in hydrogen. The peak centered at approximately 530.5 eV can be assigned to “bulk” lattice oxygen species while the broad component centered around 532.0 eV is ascribed to “surface” oxide species, including hydroxyls, surface oxides and surface contaminations. [38–40] A more pronounced effect is observed in the A46Z45A9 sample, where a broadening of the surface oxide peak also indicates the presence of oxygen atoms in different chemical environments, including unsaturated «defective» sites [13]. Interestingly, the overall intensity of the Al 2p signal of the AZA sample increases upon pretreatment in hydrogen. The analysis of Al2p/Zn3p ratios (Fig. S10) also suggests that aluminum accumulates at the surface. In the calcined sample, the amount of alumina on the surface (ZnO 65.3 % / Al2O3 34.7 %) is two times higher with respect to the bulk concentration (ZnO 83.3 % / Al2O3 16.7 %) determined by ICP-MS and increases further by 1.4 % during reduction in hydrogen (ZnO 63.9 % / Al2O3 36.1 %). This change (6.5 % absolute spectra area change, see Fig. S10b) is assumed to be statistically significant, as it was acquired in situ without moving sample or analyzer between the two measurements. This surface modification is supported by hydrogen temperature programmed reaction (H2-TPR) measurements (see Figure S11). While there is an H2-consuming reaction occurring at about 90 °C for A46Z45A9, this reaction does neither appear after repeated reoxidation and reduction of the sample (irreversible process) nor for pure A50Z50 (alumina is required for this reaction). The amount of consumed hydrogen in the reaction with A46Z45A9 amounts approximately to a reduction of 3 % of the zinc present in the sample. Assuming in a simplified way a ZnO(0001) zincite surface of the sample with oxygen termination (1.9 × 1019 atoms/m2), the consumed hydrogen would be enough to react with roughly 10 % of the surface oxygen atoms. 2.2 Catalytic performance The catalytic performance of the synthesized materials was tested in a high-pressure plug-flow reactor connected to a gas chromatograph (GC) for product analysis. Fig. 2 a shows the selectivity of the three materials at 250 °C, 30 bar and a conversion level of 0.42 ± 0.03 % (for calculations see eq. S2-S6). A50Z50 has a selectivity of 63 ± 12 % to carbon monoxide, 13 ± 0.5 % to methanol and 24 ± 3 % to methane. Similar product selectivity is obtained for different ratios of silver and zinc oxide without alumina being present (Fig. S12). The selectivity changes stepwise upon adding alumina to the catalyst. The values for A47Z48A5 are 42 ± 8 %, 11 ± 1 % and 47 ± 2 % towards carbon monoxide, methane and methanol, and 20 ± 4 %, 0 % and 80 ± 3 % for A46Z45A9, respectively. The space–time yield (STY) of methanol triples from A50Z50 (0.21 ± 0.01mmolMeOH/(gAZ*h)) to A47Z48A5 (0.63 ± 0.02mmolMeOH/(gAZA*h)) and A46Z45A9 (0.65 ± 0.02mmolMeOH/(gAZA*h)), as displayed in Fig. 2b. The apparent activation energies (EA) for the individual reactions, acquired at temperatures between 160–400 °C (Arrhenius curves are shown in Fig. S 13), are compiled in Fig. 2c. While all EA values range between 75–85kJ/mol, there is a significant increase for the carbon monoxide formation on A46Z45A9, which displays a value of 102 ± 2kJ/mol. The formation of methane is below the detection limit of the GC for A46Z45A9 at all tested temperatures, impeding the determination of any value of EA. An additional catalyst was synthesized with a highly dispersed ZnO/Al2O3 oxidic matrix combined with highly dispersed silver particles (24nm crystallite size by XRD), obtained by incipient wetness impregnation (Fig. S15). Despite the high surface area of each individual component, this material shows no carbon dioxide hydrogenation activity. 2.3 SSITKA-FTIR analysis To understand the surface mechanisms determining the activity and selectivity of the different materials, steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis coupled with infrared spectroscopy (SSITKA-FTIR) experiments were performed, switching between gas mixtures with isotopically unlabeled (12CO2 + H2 1:3, incl. 4 % Ar tracer) and 13C-labeled (13CO2 + H2 1:3) carbon dioxide at 250 °C and 15bar. In addition to the in situ time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the product gases were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). These experiments were performed with the alumina-free A50Z50 and the alumina-rich A46Z45A9 catalysts. The response of the product gas stream to the isotopic switching for A50Z50 is plotted in Fig. 3 a. All MS traces are normalized and oriented to equal deflection to facilitate comparison. Carbon monoxide responds with only a very short delay to the carbon dioxide educt and the argon tracer. Methane is detected with temporal delay, followed by methanol. Equal trends are observed for the spectra of A46Z45A9 (for a more detailed presentation see Figs. S 16–18). The FTIR spectra collected after the switch from 13CO2 + H2 to 12CO2 + H2 are displayed in Fig. 3b (A50Z50) and 3c (A46Z45A9) as difference spectra to the steady state 13CO2 + H2 conditions before switching. The main spectroscopic features are observed at 2172/2142cm−1, 2095/2053 cm−1, 3016/3006 cm−1 and between 1300–1600 cm−1 (respective 12C/13C signal pairs of each species). All observed signals are listed in Table S3. Absolute spectra are shown in Figure S19. The signal pairs at 2172/2142 cm−1 and 2095/2053 cm−1 originating from the maxima in P- and R- branches are assigned to gas phase carbon monoxide. The sharp signal pair at 2078/2038 cm−1 can be assigned to gas phase carbon dioxide [41]. The pairs at 3016/3006cm−1 and 1305/1296cm−1 are assigned to adsorbed CHx species possibly superimposed to gas phase methane. This assignment is done as the species is affected by 13C/12C switches (isotope exchange), but does not decay after switching the gas phase to pure hydrogen even after 50 min (further details shown in Fig.S20–21). While CO2, CO and CHx species are detected at equal vibrational frequencies on both catalysts, the region between 1300–1600 cm−1 shows differences. An intense signal pair with a splitting of 43 cm−1 between 13C/12C is present at 1602/1559 cm−1 (A50Z50, Fig. 3b) and 1596/1552 cm−1 (A46Z45A9, Fig. 3c). These signals are assigned to the asymmetric vibration of formate adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Several less intense, overlapping peaks appear at lower wavenumbers between 1300–1550 cm−1, with a negative wavenumber shift of these signals in the spectra of A50Z50 to A46Z45A9. The time-dependent evolution of these peaks in the spectra of A50Z50, used to follow the exchange of surface species in steady-state conditions after the isotope switch, is plotted in Fig. 3d (integration borders listed in Fig.S19c). In this case, carbon monoxide is the first product species detected, followed by CH4/CHx and with further delay by formate (HCOOads). Equal time-dependent trends for surface species detected by FTIR are observed for the A46Z45A9 catalyst, including the formation of CHx (Fig. S17). The calculated residence time for species as detected by FTIR and MS are listed in Table S4. For both samples, the CO-MS signal saturates before the steady state of the CHx and HCOO surface species by FTIR. Likewise, for sample A50Z50, the CH4-MS signal saturates (167 ± 40s) before the HCOO-FTIR signal reaches steady state (approx. 480 s). Methanol and formate signals for both samples equilibrate on a similar timescale (between 300–600s) in MS and FTIR. 3 Discussion The synthesized A50Z50, A47Z48A5 and A46Z45A9 materials show a clear change in the morphological characteristics of the zinc oxide phase upon the addition of alumina, while the dimension of silver particles remains constant. This allows us to focus on the effect of alumina on the dispersion of zinc oxide particles. As described in the literature, [11,13,16,42] the addition of alumina has a dispersing effect, in our case more than doubling the surface area. In line with Behrens et al, [13] XPS measurements indicate that the reduced ZnO/Al2O3 mixture in the AZA sample cannot be assumed to be a homogeneous mixed oxide (Fig. S10). XPS and TPR measurements (Fig. S11) indicate that the morphology change during reduction happens already below 100 °C in hydrogen atmosphere and is irreversible during subsequent oxidation in O2. Literature reports assign a reduction signal around 100 °C to the reduction of surface oxides interacting with Ag [43] or other nanoparticles like Ru. [44] Frei et al. observed major modifications of the Al3+ coordination to oxygen (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 ratio of 69/29/1) in 10 % hydrogen atmosphere, changing from octahedral (before activation) to tetrahedral (after activation). [45] Our experiments, performed on the sample with significantly higher alumina content, indicate that the transition already starts during calcination, and continues during the reducing pretreatment. We assign this transition to the reallocation of alumina towards the particle surface and the removal of surface hydroxyls, unsaturated surface oxides, and oxygen-containing contaminations (XPS, Fig. S10). These species are removed to a larger extent on A46Z45A9, creating oxygen vacancies (except for desorbing contaminations). Further studies are required to examine whether these created oxygen vacancies are active sites for carbon dioxide reduction (i.e. reoccupied oxygen sites under reaction conditions), as these might already be irreversibly deactivated during the reductive reconstruction, as suggested by Behrens et al. [13] The morphological findings regarding AZ and AZA are summarized in Fig. 4 b and 4c. The addition of alumina not only changes the morphology of the catalyst, it also has a strong influence on the reactivity towards carbon dioxide hydrogenation (Fig. 2). Pure A50Z50 mainly shows the formation of carbon monoxide, with minor selectivity towards methanol and a significant amount of formed methane. So far, silver- or gold-based catalysts have not been used for the methanation of carbon dioxide, and also copper-based materials rarely show a methane-selectivity in the 1–10 % range [26]. This selectivity remains constant for different Ag/ZnO ratios (FigureS12). The methane formation from carbon dioxide is intensely studied mostly for non-noble metal catalysts such as nickel [7]. Only after addition of alumina the selectivity stepwise changes towards the production of methanol. For A46Z45A9, GC analysis could not resolve any carbon monoxide formation below 250 °C or methane at all (Fig. 2). The determined apparent activation energies (EA) are very similar for all products in A50Z50 and the intermediate A47Z48A5. The strong increase in EA for carbon monoxide and methane (EA too high to detect any product) in A46Z45A9 indicates that the surface modifications selectively interfere with the reaction pathway of carbon dioxide towards carbon monoxide (eq. (2)). As the intermediate catalyst A47Z48A5 does not show such EA changes, it can be assumed that here both reaction pathways are still active. The modification of the oxidic phase from AZ to AZA does not influence the silver particle size, which allows to connect changes in the performance to the ZnO/Al2O3 particles and/or their interface with silver. The complexity of a system with several parameters varied at once can be seen in the inactive catalyst with both highly dispersed ZnO/Al2O3 and silver nanoparticles, synthesized by impregnation (Fig. S15). This highlights the importance of the synergy between the transition metal and oxide phase. In these bifunctional catalysts, a high activity of each individual component can be knocked down by lacking or incompatibility of the connecting interface sites [8]. SSITKA-FTIR data show that residence times increase in the following order: CO < CHx < HCOOads (FTIR), while for the products detected using MS the following order is observed: CO < CH4 < MeOH. As the residence time of CH4 detected by MS is significantly lower than the one of the formate surface species (Table S4), we conclude that methane does not form via the formate intermediate as indicated by Baiker et al. for Ag/ZrO2 [31] or for other materials (Cu/ZrO2, [31,46] Ni), [47] but rather via a COads intermediate species. This statement assumes that no pure Cad, which may be a potential further reaction intermediate, is involved in the mechanism at these temperatures. [26] The direct link between COads and methane was also observed by Wang et al. on Pd/Al2O3, without methanol production and not correlated to the surface formate coverage. [48] On the other hand, the observed strong IR band due to formate (HCOOads) species appearing under reaction conditions indicates that the formation of methanol on silver-based catalysts takes place via the formate pathway, as observed for copper-based catalysts. [10] However, an additional contribution to methanol formation via a COads pathway cannot be excluded. Results suggest two main concurring reaction pathways; the first involves COads as an intermediate and leads to the formation of carbon monoxide and methane; the second evolves via HCOOads and mainly leads to the formation of methanol. The apparent activation energy EA for the formate pathway displays negligible changes upon the addition of alumina to the AZ phase. If the rate-determining step of methanol formation is the hydrogenation of formate, as already reported for CZA [6], then this reaction step is not influenced. Conversely, the carbon monoxide pathway is strongly hindered on A46Z45A9. The addition of alumina influences the EA and with this the overall selectivity toward carbon monoxide and methane. The summarized conclusions regarding the surface intermediates are schematically shown in Fig. 4a. Several studies correlate a lower selectivity toward carbon monoxide to a stronger adsorption of COads species to the catalyst surface, which hinders the desorption of carbon monoxide. [49,50] We did not observe a signal attributed to adsorbed carbon monoxide in either case, which is neither observable on the copper-based CZA catalyst. [10]. SSITKA-FTIR measurements of the A50Z50 and A47Z48A9 catalysts give an insight on the key surface species during the reaction. The region between 1300–1600cm−1 shows several overlapping pairs of 12C/13C species. The only one that can be assigned with sufficient certainty is the asymmetric formate vibration, shifting between both analyzed materials by approx. 6cm−1. However, it cannot be clearly stated if the shift in maxima originates from a change in the formate/substrate interaction, or from the infrared signal overlap of other species expected in this frequency region. Further signals that might contribute to the overall signal between 1300–1600cm−1 are the formate symmetric bending mode (expected approx. 210–230cm−1 blue-shifted compared to the asymmetric mode) [10,51], the carbonate/bicarbonate bidentate/unidentate vibrational modes [52], or further short-lived reaction intermediates on ZnO/Al2O3 or silver [51,53]. Adsorbed formaldehyde [54,55] as observed on Ag/ZrO2 [31] was not detected. More experiments are required to assign individual contributions to the overall signal in this region. Even though it is not possible to disentangle these contributions, it can be stated that the type and/or quantity of the present surface species affected by the isotopically labeled molecules differ between A50Z50 and A47Z48A9. These surface species are not present on CZA catalysts under similar conditions [10], thus the silver-based materials could have a larger steady state concentration thereof. This creates the possibility to disentangle several relevant reaction intermediates under operando conditions. Specific adsorbate signals appearing in both cases are the double peak pairs at 3016/3006 cm−1 and 1305/1296 cm−1, which are assigned to surface CHx species. The vibrational frequency overlaps well with gas phase methane, but this species remains stable on the catalyst surface for more than 50min after removal of the carbon dioxide feed (and thus possible gas phase methane product, see Fig. S21). Adsorbed molecular methane typically desorbs at low temperature from metal surfaces [56] or from zinc oxide [57], thus we assign this signal to strongly adsorbed CHx species. They originate from the carbon dioxide feed and interact with other reaction intermediates, as shown by isotope exchange (Fig.S20), so they influence the accessible surface sites of the catalyst. Adsorbed CHx species could have a poisoning effect on the overall reaction but could also potentially be utilized for targeting the reaction towards C2+ products, as these typically require a hydrocarbon pool for the formation of C–C bonds [58]. The disparity between both reaction pathways (CO/CH4 and HCOOads/MeOH) upon modification of the catalyst composition indicates that key surface sites for the respective pathways differ on the alumina-rich surface of A46Z45A9 compared to pure A50Z50. They could potentially be interface sites between silver and the oxide surface, as indicated by other studies [26,49,59]. 4 Conclusion The addition of alumina to Ag/ZnO-based catalysts not only yields a higher dispersion of zinc oxide, it also promotes the hydrogenation reaction of carbon dioxide to methanol. The observed surface-alumina–enriched oxide material hinders the reaction pathway towards carbon monoxide. Detected methane product is generated through the COads intermediate and decreases with increasing alumina content to complete suppression. The addition of alumina leads to a selectivity shift towards methanol, evidently altering the surface state of the ZnO/Al2O3 phase and the observed surface species during reaction. The targeted quenching of the CO/CH4 pathway (increased EA) on the alumina-enriched surface oxide indicates that surface sites affected by alumina are relevant for the reverse water–gas-shift reaction and carbon dioxide methanation. Infrared spectroscopy identifies formate as a main reaction intermediate for methanol synthesis, but also several other surface species are observed under reaction conditions that do not appear on typical copper-based catalysts. The apparent activation energy of methanol formation via the formate pathway is not significantly affected by alumina addition. These observed catalytic trends on AZA materials may help to disentangle contributions of the oxidic catalyst phase in general from those of the metal, to design new classes of catalysts active and selective towards the formation of methanol. 5 Methods The Ag/ZnO (A50Z50) and Ag/ZnO/Al2O3 (A47Z48A5, A46Z45A9) catalysts were synthesized by co-precipitation. Ag(NO3), Zn(NO3)2 * 6 H2O and Al(NO3)3 * 9 H2O were dissolved in water in different ratios (see Table S1), acidified to pH 5 by HNO3 and dropwise added to an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 + HNO3 at pH 8.5 and 65 °C. Aqueous Na2CO3 solution (1M) was added in parallel to maintain a pH value of 8.5, leading to the precipitation of the metal carbonates. The precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with water, then dried for 60min at 75 °C. Calcination in air was performed by a heating ramp of 120min to 350 °C, followed by 5h at constant temperature and a subsequent cooling to room temperature. The surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis model [60], with a Micromeritics 3Flex analyzer and the corresponding software for data analysis. Adsorption curves are shown in Fig.S22. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired using Cu-K-alpha radiation (8.04keV), detailed spectra and calculation details of the crystal size are given in Figure S9 and Equation S1. Both XRD and BET were acquired before and after the reactivity tests. Elemental analysis by ICP-MS was measured of samples A50Z50, A46Z45A9 and a blanc reference sample digested in concentrated nitric acid and diluted to a final concentration of 0.2M HNO3. For (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) investigation, the material was dispersed in ethanol and a few drops of the suspension were deposited onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a copper grid. After evaporation of the ethanol, the grid was mounted on the single tilt holder of the microscope. STEM imaging was performed on an aberration-corrected, dedicated microscope, a HD-2700CS (Hitachi). Dark field images were recorded with a high-angle annular dark field detector (HAADF-STEM) measuring incoherently scattered electrons so that the intensity strongly increases with the atomic number (Z-contrast imaging). Furthermore, a secondary electron detector installed inside the column of the HD-2700CS microscope allows the investigation of the sample morphology as well (SE-STEM). TEM and STEM imaging combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) were performed on a JEM-F200 (JEOL) microscope equipped with two SDD EDX detectors. TEM images were recorded with a 16 M pixel CMOS camera (Rio, Gatan). Both microscopes were operated at an acceleration potential of 200 kV (cold field emitter). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements in vacuum and at near-ambient-pressure (NAP-XPS) were acquired at the In Situ Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron [61]. Spectra were acquired selecting a photon energy of 684eV and a pass energy of 50 eV. The photon incidence and analysis angles (with respect to the surface normal) are 60° and 30°, respectively. Linearly polarized light was used throughout the experiments. Photoelectrons were detected using a differentially pumped Scienta R4000 HiPP-2 electron energy analyzer coupled to a multi-channel plate/charge-coupled device camera. The sample was heated using an IR-laser (976nm, max. power 25W), focused on the back of the sample plate. Hydrogen (Linde, purity 5.0) was dosed to the sample in measurement position tuning a mass flow controller to reach the target pressure of 1 mbar. Activity tests of the catalysts were performed in a gas phase flow reactor (Phoenix reactor system, ThalesNano) with the catalyst pelletized to 250–500µm size. Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced in H2 atmosphere (30sccm, 1bar, purity5.0, PanGas) by heating up to 250 °C at a temperature-ramp of 2 °C/min. The reaction mixture was added using a pre-mixed gas (24.86 mol% CO2, 75.14 mol% H2, Messer Gas). The reaction pressure was regulated with backpressure regulators. The catalyst activity was determined after equilibration of the set conditions (45–60min) by product gas phase analysis using gas chromatography (Inficon 3000 Micro GC) with 2 columns. One molsieve column was run with an Ar carrier gas (80 °C) for the analysis of unpolar products and the second PlotU column (He carrier gas, 120 °C) was used for the detection of polar products. GC peak areas were calibrated using gas mixtures of known composition. Due to the low conversion levels of the performed reactions (<1%) and the respectively large error of determined mass balances, the total conversion level was calculated as the sum of all detected products. SSITKA-FTIR measurements were done in a flow reactor configuration with sandwich-type transmittance IR cell. The catalysts were diluted with silica (60–200nm size, Merck) in a 1:3 mass ratio for increased sample transmittance. The samples were pressed in self-supporting pellets (15 mg, 2cm2). Operando surface analysis was performed using IR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet iS50 with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector). Spectral resolution was set to 4cm−1, number of scans 16, corresponding to approx. onespectrum per 11s. The reactor outlet was connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Pfeiffer Vaccum), allowing the product analysis and tracking of gas phase response to gas switches. Due to the overlap in MS signal between fragments of the CO2 and the relevant CO product, experiments were performed once with and once without a sodium hydroxide CO2 trap between reactor outlet and mass spectrometer. The cell was flushed overnight in inert gas (25sccm He), followed by a 10 °C/min temperature ramp to 250 °C. This temperature was kept for a minimum of 60min before switching to H2 (20 sccm) at 1bar for 30min and thereafter increasing the pressure to 15bar before introducing the reactive H2 +12CO2 mixture (3:1 mix, 20sccm). By switching the educt mixture from non-labeled H2 +12CO2 to labeled H2 +13CO2, the kinetic response of both surface and gas phase species could be tracked at steady-state conditions. The switch to the reactive conditions and between non-labeled and labeled gases was followed both by FTIR and MS, before switching again to pure H2.

        "dc:description": "We study silver-zinc oxide type catalysts with and without the addition of alumina and perform structural analysis and activity tests for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Adding alumina has a dispersing effect on the zinc oxide without structurally altering the silver phase. An alumina-surface enriched ZnO/Al2O3 phase is observed with an increased surface reducibility. Ag/ZnO has a high selectivity towards carbon monoxide (63 ± 12 %) and methane (24 ± 3 %) and low selectivity towards methanol (13 ± 0.5 %). Operando infrared (SSITKA-FTIR) and mass spectrometric product detection indicate methane formation via an adsorbed carbon monoxide (COads) intermediate. The selectivity changes gradually with increasing alumina content, up to 80 ± 3 % toward methanol, and 20 ± 4 % carbon monoxide without methane detection, combined with a tripling of the space time yield to 0.65 ± 0.02mmolMeOH* g c a t - 1 *h−1 at 250 °C and 30bar. Kinetic analysis suggests that the selectivity change originates from hindering the CO-pathway, while the formate pathway leading to methanol remains active.",
