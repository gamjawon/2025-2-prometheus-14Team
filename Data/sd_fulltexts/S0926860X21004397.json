Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University Nagoya 464-8603 Japan The activity of Pt/Al2O3 in the hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) was found to monotonically increase in line with an increase in the Pt particle size from 1.0 to 2.5 nm, but was constant for a size above 2.5 nm. Comparing different crystalline phases of Al2O3, the activity of Pt/θ-Al2O3 was found to be around 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the same Pt particle size. Scanning transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of amorphous Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of < 2.0 nm and Pt nanocrystals (NCs) with a size of ≥ 2.0 nm on Al2O3. Furthermore, the fraction of amorphous Pt NPs in Pt/γ-Al2O3 was higher than that in Pt/θ-Al2O3. Pt NCs were shown to be more active than the amorphous Pt NPs in the hydrogenation of TOL owing to them having an abundance of Pt plane. Graphical abstract ga1 Keywords Hydrogenation Pt catalyst Size effect Nanocrystal Metal−support interactions 1 Introduction Supported metal nanoparticles (MNPs), in which the MNPs are dispersed on metal oxides, are important industrial catalysts used in the petrochemicals industry and in the purification of exhaust gas for automobiles. The catalytic activity of supported MNPs is linked to the size of the MNPs as the fraction of surface metal sites in the supported MNPs, such as corner, edge, and plane, depends on the size of the MNPs. This is also known as structure sensitivity for catalytic reaction.[1] For this reason, the particle size effect on catalysis has been extensively studied. As an example, the catalytic property of gold nanoparticles (NPs) in hydrogenation[2] and water−gas shift[3,4] reactions was shown to increase in line with a decrease in the particle size, due to an increase in the fraction of corner sites in the catalyst. Platinum (Pt) NPs with a facetted structure have been shown to be highly active in dehydrogenation of alkane,[5] ammonium borane hydrolysis−dehydrogenation,[6] and carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation[7] reactions. Furthermore, as the size of the MNPs decreases, they lose their regular atomic arrangement, and exhibit a disordered atomic arrangement that includes a complex system of facets and twinning.[8–10] Coordinatively unsaturated sites on the MNPs induced by a disordered arrangement promote various catalytic reactions.[11–14] In addition to this, the support may have an effect on the geometric and electronic structure of the MNPs as a result of metal−support interactions (MSIs).[15–17] For example, penta-coordinated Al3+ sites on the (100) plane of γ-Al2O3 have been shown to interact strongly with PtO or Pt species, leading to the formation of single Pt atoms and 2D raft-like Pt NPs.[18] However, large 3D Pt NPs form on α-Al2O3 in the absence of these penta-coordinated Al3+ sites. The shape and surface structure of palladium (Pd) NPs, which vary according to the crystalline phase of the Al2O3 support, have been shown to affect their catalytic activity in oxidation and hydrogenation reactions.[19–21]. Supported Pt NPs are one of the most commonly used catalysts for the hydrogenation of chemical compounds that have unsaturated bonds, such as CC and CO, to produce useful chemicals.[22–32] In terms of an elemental strategy, the use of Pt should be reduced and the catalytic activity per Pt, or the turnover frequency (TOF), of the supported Pt NPs should be improved. To this end, the size effect of Pt NPs on hydrogenation reactions has been investigated. For example, it has been reported that upon an increase in particle size from 0.7 to 2.1 nm, the TOF of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and acetylene hydrogenation over Pt/TiO2 increases due to an increase in the electron density of Pt.[26] The effect of Pt particle size on the hydrogenation of quinoline has been rationalized according to the d-band electron structure of Pt and the interactions between Pt particles and quinoline.[27] Moreover, isolated Pt atoms on TiO2 have been shown to be remarkably less active than small Pt clusters for the hydrodeoxygenation of m-cresol due to their low activity in H2 dissociation and their weak interactions with m-cresol.[31] The shape of Pt NPs has also been reported to be related to their catalytic activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.[23,24,30,33] For instance, in hydrogenation of benzene, both cyclohexane and cyclohexene as products were formed on cuboctahedral nanoparticles with Pt(111) and Pt(100) facets, whereas only cyclohexane was produced on cubic nanoparticles with Pt(100) facet.[30] Therefore, the precise design of the electronic or geometric structure of supported Pt particles can be used to improve the key steps in the hydrogenation reaction, such as the dissociation of H2 and adsorption of the substrate. In addition, since the adsorption energy on the Pt surface varies by the carbon number and bond saturation of the substrate, such as linear alkenes or aromatics, the size effect of Pt NPs is expected to be different depending on the target substrate for the hydrogenation reaction.[34,35]. Recently, the hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) has attracted much attention toward the aim of the storage of H2 in a liquid hydrogen carrier.[36,37] In this reaction process, three H2 molecules are added to one TOL to produce methylcyclohexane (MCH). The size effect of Pt NPs on the hydrogenation of TOL has been studied, wherein for the Pt particle size range of 1.5–5.2 nm, 3.1 nm Pt particles supported on mesoporous SiO2 showed the highest activity toward the hydrogenation of TOL.[38] However, it has been also claimed that the activity of Pt particles in the hydrogenation of TOL is almost independent of their size.[39] The above studies focused on the reaction kinetics and development of the catalytic materials, and did not probe the structure of supported Pt NPs at the atomic level. Therefore, there is a need to explain the size effect that Pt NPs have on the hydrogenation of TOL based on detailed structural analysis of supported Pt NPs. Herein, we report the importance of crystallinity of Pt NPs for hydrogenation of TOL. The structure of supported Pt NPs with a variety of sizes was analyzed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and aberration-corrected high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). It was found that with the increase in particle size of Pt from 1 to 2.5 nm, the crystallinity and activity of the Pt NPs in the hydrogenation of TOL improved significantly. In addition, crystallinity of Pt NPs was tunable also using the Al2O3 support with different crystalline phase. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The γ-Al2O3 support was prepared by a pyrolysis of boehmite at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The boehmite was purchased from Sasol (PURAL alumina). The θ-Al2O3 support (Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd., AKP-G07) was also calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. Pt nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 (Pt loading: 2 wt%) were prepared by an impregnation method. The Al2O3 supports (1.96 g) were impregnated with the 8.6 wt% aqueous solution of Pt(NO3)4 (0.47 g), supplied from Cataler Co. After stirring for 1 h, the resulting suspensions was evaporated at 60 °C with a rotary evaporator to removed excess water. The obtained solids were dried at 80 °C overnight, and then calcined at 300–600 °C under air for 3 h to obtain Pt/Al2O3 having different Pt particle sizes. 2.2 Characterization 2.2.1 CO adsorption measurements A BEL-CAT-B instrument (MicrotracBEL) with a thermal conductivity detector was used to quantify the dispersion of Pt was from the total amount of adsorbed gas, assuming that CO was adsorbed on the Pt surface in a 1:1 stoichiometry. A sample of about 50 mg was placed in a sample tube and reduced in flowing 100% H2 at 200 °C for 10 min. After cooling the sample down was to 50 °C under a flow of He, CO pulse adsorption were performed by flowing a mixture of 5% CO/He. 2.2.2 XAFS spectroscopy measurements XAFS measurements were carried out on the BL5B1 beamline at the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center in Aichi, Japan. Prior to the measurements, the samples were reduced in a flow of 50% H2/N2 at 200 °C for 10 min. The sample were sealed in polyethylene bags under N2 without any exposure of the samples to air. The Pt L3-edge XAFS spectra were taken at room temperature by a conventional transmission method. The Athena and Artemis software included in the Demeter package was used to analyze the sample data. 2.2.3 PXRD measurements Synchrotron PXRD measurements of the catalysts were carried out at a wavelength of 1.0 Å (12.4 keV) using the BL5S2 beamline at the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center. Prior to carrying out the PXRD measurements, the samples of the catalysts were reduced under a flowing mixture of 50% H2/N2 at 200 °C for 10 min. And then, the samples were placed in Lindemann glass tubes with an inside diameter of 0.5 mm. 2.2.4 STEM measurements STEM measurements were performed using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F double spherical aberration-corrected STEM operated at 200 kV. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were exposed to a 50% H2/N2 atmosphere at 200 °C for 10 min. After this pretreatment, the STEM samples were prepared by a spreading drop of a methanol suspension of the pretreated catalysts onto the carbon microgrid of copper mesh. 2.3 Testing of the catalysts in the hydrogenation of TOL The hydrogenation of TOL was carried out in a conventional fixed-bed flow reactor. A 100 mg of catalyst were placed inside a U-shaped quartz tube (an inner diameter of 4 mm). Before the activity tests, the catalysts were reduced in a flow of 50% H2/Ar at 200 °C for 10 min. The hydrogenation of TOL was then performed at 200 °C under a flowing mixture of 0.8% TOL/10% H2/Ar at atmospheric pressure. The total flow rate was 20 mL min−1, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 12 000 mL g−1 h−1. TOL was introduced into the quartz tube by bubbling 10% H2/Ar gas though a saturator kept at 0 °C. An online Shimazu Nexis GC-2030 gas chromatograph equipped with a dielectric-barrier discharge ionization detector attached to an Rt-Msieve 5 A capillary column and an Rt®-Q-BOND capillary column was used to analyze the effluent gas. The TOFtotal and TOFsurface values of the hydrogenation of TOL are defined as the reaction rates per molar amount of the total Pt and the surface Pt of the catalysts, respectively. The molar amounts of the surface Pt were calculated from CO pulse measurements. 3 Results and Discussion Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method using aqueous solution of Pt(NO3)4 as a Pt precursor and γ-Al2O3 (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area: 204 m2 g−1) and θ-Al2O3 (BET surface area: 73 m2 g−1) as supports.[40] 27Al MAS NMR measurements have shown that γ-Al2O3 has penta-coordinated Al3+ sites that interact strongly with Pt species, while θ-Al2O3 does not.[18,19] According to the IR spectra and H2O-temperature programmed desorption of Al2O3 support, the density of surface hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3 was more than two times higher than that of θ-Al2O3.[41] The Pt particle size of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was varied by tuning the calcination temperatures in the range of 300–600 °C. Prior to their characterization and catalytic activity tests in the hydrogenation of TOL, the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were reduced under a flow of 50% H2/Ar at 200 °C for 10 min. The Pt dispersions and Pt particle sizes of the Pt/Al2O3 samples estimated from CO pulse adsorption measurements are shown in Table 1. The Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are denoted as X nm Pt/Al2O3, where X represents the particle size of the Pt in Pt/Al2O3 estimated from the CO pulse adsorption measurements. The Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. S1. The white line intensity of Pt/Al2O3 at around 11 567 eV is 1.4–1.6, which is closer to the value of Pt foil (1.3) than that of PtO2 (2.3). These results indicate that the Pt species in Pt/Al2O3 is mainly in the metallic state. In detail, the white line intensity of Pt/Al2O3, which is slightly higher than that of Pt foil, suggests that cationic Pt species are present at the interface between Pt and Al2O3, formed due to the charge transfer that occurs from the Pt to O atoms.[42] Upon an increase in the particle size of the Pt, the white line intensity gradually decreases, implying an increase in Pt species in the metallic state. Fig. 1 shows Fourier transforms (FTs) of the Pt-L3 edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. In the EXAFS spectra of 1.8 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1.4 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3, Pt−O scattering peaks (1.6 Å) without Pt−Pt scattering peaks (2.5 Å) are observed. The Pt−O scattering peak can be attributed to the interface between the Pt particles and the Al2O3 surface. However, the absence of Pt−Pt scattering peaks suggests the presence of isolated Pt atoms or amorphous Pt particles without any ordered Pt−Pt bonds in these samples. In the EXAFS spectra of 2.5 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 2.5 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3, low intensity Pt−Pt scattering peaks are present in addition to Pt−O scattering peaks. Moreover, for 6.9 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 6.6 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3, the EXAFS spectra show high intensity Pt−Pt scattering peaks and low intensity Pt−O scattering peaks, indicating that crystalline Pt particles with an ordered arrangement of Pt are formed. Fig. 2 shows the PXRD patterns of Pt/Al2O3. In the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with a Pt particle size of smaller than 2.5 nm, the PXRD patterns of Al2O3 supports are only observed. The PXRD pattern of 2.5 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 also shows only the PXRD patterns of γ-Al2O3. In contrast, the PXRD pattern of 2.5 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3 shows diffraction peaks attributed to Pt with a face centered cubic (fcc) structure. Thus, the crystallinity of such small Pt NPs is dependent on the Al2O3 supports, and θ-Al2O3 offers more crystalline Pt NPs than γ-Al2O3. When the Pt NPs grew to greater than 2.5 nm, both 6.9 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 6.6 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3 show the diffraction peaks of fcc Pt, indicating formation of crystalline Pt particles with an ordered arrangement on both Al2O3 supports. The PXRD results are consistent with the EXAFS results. Figs. S2 and S3 show typical STEM images and Pt particle size distributions of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. For all of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, Pt NPs with a size of smaller than 2.5 nm were found to be present as the major species on the Al2O3. The fraction of Pt NPs larger than 2.5 nm was found to gradually increase in line with an increase in the average Pt particle size. For 6.9 nm Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 6.6 nm Pt/θ-Al2O3, a relatively large number of Pt NPs with a size of > 5 nm was observed. Although isolated Pt atoms (not included in the Pt particle size distribution) were also found to be present on the Al2O3, the fraction of isolated Pt atoms in the samples was < 0.001 for all of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. From above results, althoght the size distribution of Pt particles evaluated by STEM does not exactly agree with the average Pt particle size estimated by CO pulse adsorption, it shows the trend that the fraction of larger Pt particles increases as the average Pt particle size increases. Fig. 3 shows STEM images of representative Pt NPs with different Pt particle sizes on θ-Al2O3. The orientation of the lattice fringes of the Pt NPs are taken directly from fast FTs (FFTs) of the STEM images. From these images, it can be seen that small Pt NPs with a size of 1.9 nm are amorphous structure, with disordered atomic arrangement (Fig. 3a), while the Pt NPs with sizes of 2.4 and 4.7 nm have an Pt fcc structure (Figs. 3b and 3c). To identify the change in the crystallinity of the Pt NPs according to their particle size, statistical analysis of the ordered and disordered Pt NPs was performed based on the observation of lattice fringes. If lattice fringes of the Pt NPs were observed, the Pt NPs were determined to be ordered; conversely, if no lattice fringes were observed, the Pt NPs were determined to be disordered.[10] Since not all the Pt NPs in the STEM images are in focus due to the difference in the thickness of the Al2O3 support, only Pt NPs for which the arrangement of the Pt atoms is visible were counted (Figs. S4 and S5). The fractions of ordered/disordered Pt NPs of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different average Pt particle sizes were evaluated. Figs. 3d and 3e show the fractions of the ordered/disordered Pt particles in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalysts according to the size of the Pt NPs. The fraction of disordered Pt particles in the size region of 1.0–1.5 nm is high, at ca. 0.7. As the size of the particles increases, the fraction of the disordered Pt particles decreases, while the fraction of ordered Pt particles increases. When the Pt particle size is larger than 2.0 nm, the fraction of ordered Pt particles is more than 0.8. The dramatic change in the crystallinity of the Pt NPs with a size of around 2.0 nm on Al2O3 is consistent with the results observed in a previous study.[8,10] A comparison of the Al2O3 supports shows that the fraction of crystalline Pt NPs in Pt/θ-Al2O3 is higher than that in Pt/γ-Al2O3 in the size region of particles that are above 2.0 nm. This is probably due to the strong interaction of γ-Al2O3 with the Pt species, as a result of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites being present on the (100) facets of γ-Al2O3.[18,43]. A nanocrystal (NC) model can be used to estimate the fraction of surface sites on a Pt NC in an ideal Pt crystal.[20,44,45] Fig. 4 shows the Pt NC size dependence of the fraction of Pt surface sites estimated based on a model of a Pt cuboctahedron that takes into account the atomic radius of Pt. The fraction of Pt(111) and Pt(100) planar sites in the Pt NCs increases in line with an increase in the crystal size. For Pt NCs of > 2.0 nm in size, the Pt plane on Pt NCs were found to be the dominant sites. Therefore, the crystalline Pt particles of > 2.0 nm in size feature an abundance of these plane. However, Pt NCs that are smaller than 2.0 nm have a higher fraction of coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, such as corners and edges. Due to the disordered arrangement of Pt atoms in them, the amorphous Pt NPs observed by STEM have a higher fraction of coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites than the Pt NCs. In other words, there is an abundance of corner and edge sites on the amorphous Pt particles of < 2.0 nm in size. The activities of Pt/Al2O3 with different Pt particle sizes and crystalline phases of Al2O3 were evaluated in the hydrogenation of TOL. For the hydrogenation of TOL over Pt/Al2O3, only MCH is detected as a product. To eliminate the effects of gas diffusion and reaction heat on the rate of the hydrogenation of TOL, the hydrogenation of TOL per mole of Pt in the catalyst (TOFtotal) was calculated from the < 40% conversion of TOL at 200 °C. The TOFtotal of Pt/γ-Al2O3 exhibits a volcano-like trend with respect to the Pt particle size, where, as the Pt particle size increases from 1.8 to 2.5 nm, there is an increase in the TOFtotal of Pt/γ-Al2O3, but as the Pt particle size increases beyond 2.5 nm, there is a decrease in the TOFtotal of Pt/γ-Al2O3 ( Fig. 5a). The TOFtotal of Pt/θ-Al2O3 also shows a similar trend to that of Pt/γ-Al2O3, albeit with the TOFtotal of Pt/θ-Al2O3 being 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/γ-Al2O3 at each size. In terms of catalytic durability, there was no decrease in the hydrogenation activity of 1.8 nm Pt/Al2O3, even after 24 h (Fig. S6). The sharp decrease in the TOFtotal according to the Pt particle size from around 2.0–6.9 nm indicates that the number of surface Pt atoms in the catalyst strongly affects their apparent activity in the hydrogenation of TOL (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows a plot of the rate of the hydrogenation of TOL per mole of Pt surface in the catalyst (TOFsurface) versus the particle size of the Pt. For both Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/θ-Al2O3, the TOFsurface values can be seen to increase monotonically upon an increase in the Pt particle size from 1.4 to 2.5 nm, with the TOFsurface values remaining constant at a Pt size of above 2.5 nm. These results are consistent with those in a previous report on the size effect of Pt NPs in the size range of 1.5–3.1 nm supported on mesoporous silica on the hydrogenation of TOL.[38] Comparing the structure and activity in the hydrogenation of TOL of Pt/Al2O3, the size dependence of Pt NPs on the TOFsurface value is similar to that observed for the fraction of crystalline Pt NPs, as shown in Figs. 3d and 3e. Therefore, it can be determined that crystalline Pt NPs are more active in the hydrogenation of TOL than amorphous Pt NPs. Taking the Al2O3 supports into consideration, the TOFsurface value of Pt/θ-Al2O3 is around 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/γ-Al2O3 at each size. The fraction of ordered Pt NPs in Pt/γ-Al2O3 is around 10% lower than that in Pt/θ-Al2O3. This indicates that Pt NPs on γ-Al2O3 have more distorted structure with more coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites than those on θ-Al2O3 due to the stronger MSIs between Pt NPs and γ-Al2O3. Although it is difficult to quantitatively discuss the effect of Al2O3 crystalline phase on the hydrogenation of TOL, Pt NPs on θ-Al2O3 with weak MSIs are highly active than those on γ-Al2O3. The dependence of the partial pressure of H2 and TOL on the hydrogenation of TOL over Pt/Al2O3 with a size of 2.5 nm was investigated (Fig. S7). As the partial pressure of H2 and TOL increased, the TOFsurface of Pt/Al2O3 increased. Therefore, the reaction orders with respect to H2 and TOL in the hydrogenation of TOL are positive, with values of around 1.0 and 0.7, respectively. According to previous reports, the hydrogenation of TOL proceeds via the dissociation of H2 on the surface of Pt followed by the addition of the resulting H atoms to the TOL that is also adsorbed on the surface.[46–48] In general, it is known that H2 molecules readily undergo dissociative adsorption on the surface of Pt.[27,49–51] Therefore, it has been suggested that H atoms and TOL molecules competitively adsorb on the surface of the Pt during the hydrogenation process, with their coverage being directly related to their activity in the hydrogenation of TOL.[46,52–54] Previous studies have shown that when TOL adsorbs onto metal surfaces, the phenyl group of TOL is preferentially adsorbed onto ensembles of three or four metal atoms.[55–57] In addition to this, it also necessary for there to be adsorption sites for H2 molecules adjacent to the adsorbed TOL for the hydrogenation of TOL to proceed. Therefore, the H2 and TOL molecules simultaneously adsorb on sites on the Pt plane rather than at corner and edge sites, followed by the subsequent hydrogenation of TOL. For these reasons, it was concluded that crystalline Pt particles of > 2.0 nm in size with a high fraction of plane are highly active in the hydrogenation of TOL, as shown in Scheme 1. 4 Conclusions The relationship between hydrogenation activity of TOL and crystallinity of the Pt NPs was investigated using the size-controlled Pt NPs supported on Al2O3. At Pt particle sizes of smaller than 2.5 nm, the activity of Pt/Al2O3 in the hydrogenation of TOL was observed to increase monotonically in line with an increase in the particle size of the Pt, whereas above a size of 2.5 nm the activity of Pt/Al2O3 was almost constant. The majority of Pt NPs with a size of smaller than 2 nm on the Al2O3 were found to have a disordered structure. However, when the size of the Pt particles was larger than 2 nm, ordered Pt NCs formed on the Al2O3. In addition, the fraction of Pt NCs in Pt/θ-Al2O3 was higher than that in Pt/γ-Al2O3. The Pt NCs were found to be highly active in the hydrogenation of TOL compared with the amorphous Pt NPs, as a result of them containing a high fraction of Pt plane.

        "dc:description": "The activity of Pt/Al2O3 in the hydrogenation of toluene (TOL) was found to monotonically increase in line with an increase in the Pt particle size from 1.0 to 2.5 nm, but was constant for a size above 2.5 nm. Comparing different crystalline phases of Al2O3, the activity of Pt/θ-Al2O3 was found to be around 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the same Pt particle size. Scanning transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of amorphous Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of < 2.0 nm and Pt nanocrystals (NCs) with a size of ≥ 2.0 nm on Al2O3. Furthermore, the fraction of amorphous Pt NPs in Pt/γ-Al2O3 was higher than that in Pt/θ-Al2O3. Pt NCs were shown to be more active than the amorphous Pt NPs in the hydrogenation of TOL owing to them having an abundance of Pt plane.",
