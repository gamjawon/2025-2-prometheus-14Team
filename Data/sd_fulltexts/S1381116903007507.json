Addition of BaO on Ni/SiO2 might be responsible for its high activity and resistance to sintering because it can produce a highly dispersed active surface area as bound-state Ni species, The promoted 5Ni/SiO2 catalysts were active and stable for combined CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce low H2/CO ratio syngas using a fluidized bed reactor. The Ni/SiO2 catalyst was modified by BaO in order to improve the thermal stability and the carbon deposition resistance during the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane using a fluidized bed reactor, it is possible to convert methane into syngas with low H2/CO ratio (1<H2/CO<2) at above 85% methane conversion without catalyst deactivation in 10h, in a most energy efficient and safe manner, requiring little or no external energy. Samples of the catalysts were characterized using TPR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM techniques, indicate that Ni agglomerating is a major reason for deactivation, addition of BaO might be responsible for its high activity and resistance to sintering because it can produce a highly dispersed active surface area as bound-state Ni species when the catalyst is prepared at high calcined temperatures. The addition of BaO as silica gel modifiers can be beneficial for the performance of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Keywords Ni/BaO-SiO2 catalyst CO2 reforming Partial oxidation of CH4 Fluidized bed reactor 1 Introduction Synthesis gas is a versatile feedstock for the methanol and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and several other carbonylation, hydrogenation and reduction reactions. In recent years, major research efforts have been concentrated on the CO2 reforming [1–7] and the partial oxidation [8–12]. Like the steam reforming, the dry CO2 reforming is also highly endothermic requiring a large energy input, while the partial oxidation is mildly exothermic with potential hazards due to the presence of hot spots. Some researches studies about combining CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane using a fixed bed reactor have been carried out [13–18], the product ratio of H2/CO and thus the selectivity for various Fischer–Tropsch synthesis products can be controlled by changing the feed composition. In these cases, the exothermic combustion and the successive endothermic reforming caused significant temperature gradient in the catalyst bed [19]. The fluidized bed reactor is an attractive option in the syngas production due to the combination of combustion and reforming. This is because the fluidized bed reactor provides a high rate of heat transfer in order to maintain the isothermal operation [20] and also because the permanent circulation of the catalyst particles favors the burning of carbon on it the oxygen-rich zone of the catalyst bed [21], The use of the solid catalyst as a heat carrier can resolve the hot spot problem and fluidization has quite a favorable effect on the inhibition of carbon deposition [13]. In addition, the fluidization causes the re-reduction of oxidized catalyst and regenerates the active site for the methane reforming [22]. Our previous researches have shown the Ni/Al2O3 and Pt/CoAl2O4/Al2O3 catalysts provide high activity for the combined reaction using fluidized bed reactor [23,24]. In this study, we investigate the coupling between the exothermic partial oxidation methane and the endothermic CO2 reforming of methane over the reduced Ni/BaO-SiO2 catalysts in fluidized bed reactor, manipulating the reaction conditions (viz. temperature and relative concentration of CH4, CO2 and O2 in the feed), one can control the H2/CO ratio and thus the selectivity for various Fischer–Tropsch synthesis products. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Modified supports were prepared by impregnating SiO2 (supplied from Qingdao, Strem: S BET=374m2/g, particle size: Ø=0.28–0.45mm) with an aqueous solution of barium nitrate. Followed by overnight drying at 383K, the supports were subsequently calcined at 773K in air for 4h. The support nickel catalysts (metal loading, 5wt.%) were prepared on BaO–SiO2 by the wet impregnation method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as the metal precursor, the catalyst was calcined in air at 973K for 4h before used . Ni and Ba loading means wt.% Ni or wt.% Ba in the catalyst and denoted as Ni/BaO–SiO2. 2.2 Catalytic reaction All the catalysts were tested under atmospheric pressure in a fluidized bed reactor, the reactor had its quartz tube (i.d.=20mm, H=750mm) inside a larger quartz furnace. A stainless steel net was used as a distributor in the fluidized bed reactor. A thermocouple that was connected to a PID temperature controller was placed out the quartz tube and in the middle of the catalyst bed. Pretreatment of catalysts was carried out by H2 reduction at 923K for 1h under hydrogen flow at atmospheric pressure before the reaction. Feed gases with a C/O ratio of 1 were introduced into the reactor at a total flow rate of 18,000cm3/min for 2cm3 catalyst after reduction. An ice bath was set between the reactor exit and a sampling port for gas chromatograph analysis in order to remove water from the effluent gas. The gas compositions of reactants and products were analyzed with a GC (SHIMADZU-8A) equipped with a packed column (TDX-01) and a thermal conductivity detector. 2.3 Catalytic characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained on a Rigaku-D/max-B automate power X-ray diffractometer. Anode Cu Kα(45kV, 40mA) was used as the X-ray source. The calcined catalysts were examined at a scanning rate of 2min and the obtained X-ray diffraction patterns to identify the major phases present. Before TPR experiment, the catalyst was treated at 573K for 30min in Ar (99.999%) flow. After the sample was cooled down to 303K, the temperature of the sample was increased from 323 to 973K with the ramp of 20K/min, 10%H2/Ar mixture (30cm3/min) purging with the sample. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity measurement The combined reaction was carried out over the reduced 5Ni/BaO–SiO2 catalysts at 1023K and the space velocity of 9000h−1. The time-dependent conversions of CH4 are plotted in Fig. 1 . Nickel species was regarded as the reactive site for this combined reaction and nickel loading was uniform on all the test samples, therefore, it is no evident effect on the initial activity for Ba loading, but there was great difference in the catalytic stability. However, when the Ba loading was below 8wt.%, especially for Ba-free nickel-based catalyst, it was rapidly deactivated in 3h on stream. The stability of 5Ni/BaO-SiO2 was remarkably enhanced when the Ba loading above 8wt.%. The catalytic activity of 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2 did not decrease in 10h on stream. The space velocity was varied by changing the amount of catalyst while maintaining the total flow rate at 300cm3/min. The effect of space velocity on the steady-state activity of 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2 and the product H2/CO ratio is presented in Fig. 2 . With increasing space velocity, the smaller was the gradient of CH4 conversion decrease, the conversions of CH4 and CO2 decreased. In contrast, during the partial oxidation reaction, CH4 conversion remained unchanged with increasing space velocity because of the presence of hot spots [17]. However, for the combined reaction, hot spots, less bright than in the partial oxidation of methane, have been observed visually. Consequently, the combined reaction can be operated in a more efficient manner than CO2 reforming and in a safer manner than the partial oxidation. Fig. 2 also shows that, with increasing space velocity, the selectivity to H2 is unchanged, while the selectivity to CO and the ratio H2/CO decrease slightly. Fig. 3 presents the influence of feed gas ratio on the catalytic activity of 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2. The effect of the O2/CO2 ratio was investigated for a C/O ratio of 1 and a total flow rate of 300cm3/min. The CH4 conversion increased with the ratio increasing of O2/CO2, but the CO2 conversion passes through a maximum, at low O2/CO2 ratios, the conversion of CO2 increases with increasing O2 concentration. At high O2/CO2 ratios, the CO2 concentration in the feed gas is low, but CO2 is formed via the combustion of CH4. The H2 selectivity declined for some of H2 being oxidized with increasing O2 content in feed gas. The selectivity of CO was almost not changed. The H2/CO ratios obtained in the CO2 reforming of methane (in the absence of O2) and in the partial oxidation of methane (in the absence of CO2) were around 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. The combined partial oxidation and CO2 reforming methane can provide a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio between 1.0 and 2.0, which increases with increasing O2/CO2 ratio. As showed in Fig. 4 , when the reduction temperature was 823K, mainly total oxidation of methane occurs. It is well known that Ni2+ is active for total oxidation of CH4 but not for partial oxidation or CO2 reforming of CH4, while Ni0 is the active component both for the partial oxidation of CH4 and for the CO2 reforming reaction [25,26]. The catalytic activity reach maximum until the reduction temperature is above 923K. This result indicates that the active site is enough for this reaction at 923K for reduction using the fluidized reactor. The effect of reaction temperature on the steady-state activity of 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2 is shown in Fig. 5 , the conversion of CH4 and CO2 monotonically increased with increasing of reaction temperature, however, the selectivity of H2 and CO increase slightly when the reaction temperature is above 973K. Because reforming CH4 with H2O and CO2 is an endothermic reaction and an increasing reaction temperature shifts the reaction to production. It indicated that higher temperature was favor to produce H2 and CO, and lower temperature would lead to combustion of CH4. 3.2 Catalyst characterization Fig. 6 gives XRD patterns of 5Ni/BaO-SiO2 and 10BaO/SiO2. The intensities of nickel peaks were influenced by addition of BaO, the higher was the BaO loading on catalyst, the weaker and broader become diffraction peaks due to Ni, this suggests that smaller nickel particles are formed in catalysts of higher BaO loading, no bulk nickel peaks appear in XRD pattern of 10BaO/SiO2. Addition of Ba segregated the particle size of nickel, however, BaO itself as a support formed large nickel particles probably due to its small surface area, this indicates that the BaO is highly dispersed on the support of SiO2 and it promotes the dispersion of NiO. The of NiO particle sizes, measured using XRD, are 46.1 and 82.9nm of fresh and used catalyst, respectively. It can be showed that Ni aggregation dominated the activity change. Ni particles could be highly dispersed on BaO-modified SiO2 support, which impeded the Ni particles aggregation during time on stream. The BaO-modified 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst, therefore, has a higher stability. Accordingly, the highly dispersed Ni particles can be easily reduced, which leads to an initially much active catalyst. TEM micrograph of the 5Ni/SiO2 and 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 7A and B , respectively) provided clear evidence of nickel oxide particles distribution on support. In the case of Ni/SiO2 catalyst, nickel particles were not uniformly distributed on the surfaces, with a diameter ranging between 20 and 60nm. However, nickel particles were segregated and dispersed in the 5Ni/10BaO-SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 7B). The reducibility of the Ni/BaO-SiO2 catalysts was studied by TPR under 5%H2/Ar flow in the range from 323 to 1073K, presented in Fig. 8 . Because a very weak interaction between Ni and SiO2, the microcrystalline nickel oxide has been reported as the free state of the Ni active phase because of its mobility, which leads to migration, aggregation and growth of particles at high temperatures so that the dispersion of the active phase rapidly decreases, which is one of the main reasons why the supported Ni-based catalyst is easily deactivated. It can be seen that the predominant phase is that which a strong interaction between Ni and BaO-modified SiO2. This interaction become stronger with increasing barium loading. This shifting of the reduction profile to higher temperatures is due to the strong metal support interactions and to the presence of calcium as it has been reported in the literature [27,28]. When prepared by wet impregnation on BaO-modified support at high calcined temperatures, the nickel ions tend to be highly dispersed and can be segregated. Although reduction is difficult, at least above 893K, it exhibits very activity and resistant to sintering once reduced, these bound state Ni particles remain highly dispersed due to their very low mobility, so they have long life and good stability. XRD results were also in agreement with TPR results, signals related to BaO or to interaction compounds between the modifier and the support were not detected. 4 Conclusion By combining the endothermic and exothermic reactions of methane with CO2 and O2 over BaO-SiO2 catalyst using fluidized bed reactor, methane can be converted to syngas with low H2/CO ratio required for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, by changing the O2/CO2 ratio of the feed gases, the ratio of the products H2/CO can be controlled between 1 and 2. The nickel particles tend to be highly dispersed and can be fixed by being segregated in BaO-modified support, which had a significant effect on its reduction behavior and show good resistance to aggregation of the nickel particles. These catalysts present high stability and activity with respect to the Ni/SiO2. This combining reaction can be run in a most energy efficient and safe manner in a fluidized bed reactor.

Samples of the catalysts were characterized using TPR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM techniques, indicate that Ni agglomerating is a major reason for deactivation, addition of BaO might be responsible for its high activity and resistance to sintering because it can produce a highly dispersed active surface area as bound-state Ni species when the catalyst is prepared at high calcined temperatures.
