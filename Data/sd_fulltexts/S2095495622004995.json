Graphical abstract The electronic state of FeWO4 was optimized by the S atom doping strategy to promote the oxygen reduction ability of S-FeWO4/NC. Finally, the zinc-air battery with S-FeWO4/NC exhibited high power density and excellent cycle life. The exploration of active and long-lived oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for the commercialization of zinc-air batteries are of immense significance but challenging. Herein, the sulfur doped FeWO4 embedded in the multi-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon structure (S-FeWO4/NC) was successfully synthesized. The doped S atoms optimized the charge distribution in FeWO4 and enhanced the intrinsic activity. At the same time, S doping accelerated the formation of reaction intermediates during the adsorption reduction of O2 on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC. Accordingly, the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst showed more positive half-wave potential (0.85 V) and better stability than that of the FeWO4/NC catalyst. Furthermore, the S-FeWO4/NC-based zinc-air battery exhibited considerable power density of 150.3 mW cm−2, high specific capacity of 912.7 mA h g−1 , and prominent cycle stability up to 220 h. This work provides an assistance to the development of cheap and efficient tungsten-based oxygen reduction catalysts and the promotion of its application in the zinc-air battery. Keywords S doping FeWO4 Oxygen reduction reaction Zinc-air batteries 1 Introduction The zinc-air battery with environmental friendliness, high-security and low price is regarded as an ideal energy-storage device, which provides a reasonable answer to the problem of energy shortage [1–5]. A sluggish multi-electron transfer pathway for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) severely impairs the power density and rechargeability of zinc-air batteries [6]. Hence, it is an eager demand to develop highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts for promoting reaction kinetics and actual performances of zinc-air batteries. So far, platinum and its alloys have been regarded as the benchmark for ORR. However, these noble metal-based materials suffer from high cost and insufficient stability, limiting their commercial application in zinc-air batteries [7]. Therefore, developing non-precious metal ORR catalysts with reasonable cost, outstanding activity, and cyclic stability is all-important for zinc-air batteries. To date, tungsten-based materials, including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and oxygenated salts have been researched extensively for ORR due to the abundant reserve, and vigorous activity of tungsten resources [8]. Especially, FeWO4 with wolframite structure has concurrently the superior characteristics of tungsten and iron oxide [9]. It has been reported that Fe2O3 and WO3 possess ORR catalytic properties in the electrochemical reaction, which may make FeWO4 emerge as a potential ORR electrocatalyst [10,11]. Transition metal tungsten has a highly unsaturated 5d orbital, with super negative charge, and is easy to coordinate with various oxygen-containing groups. In the electrochemical process of oxygen reaction catalysis, tungsten components can timely convert the oxygen-containing groups produced in the reaction process and release the occupied active sites, so as to improve the oxygen electrocatalytic activity of catalytic materials and promote the rapid progress of the reaction [12]. Besides, the metallic orbital hybridization of Fe and W is beneficial to tune the electronic structure of FeWO4, leading to multiple metal centers can act as active sites and ameliorate the ORR performance [13]. At the same time, FeWO4 possesses excellent electron transport properties and high electrochemical stability required for electrode materials [14]. But the weaker oxygen bond on FeWO4 immediately translates into a high energy barrier of OO bond cleavage, hindering the oxygen reduction process [15]. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the ORR activity of FeWO4 via effective strategies, such as changing the electronic structure of FeWO4 or adding more active sites. Obviously, heteroatom (N, S, P, B, etc.) doping can be a strategy to improve ORR activity of FeWO4 with multiple advantages, which can not only tune the electronic structure of FeWO4 to the optimal state, but also increase additional active sites [16–19]. Heteroatom doping also produces structural and charge defects, promotes charge transfer and oxygen adsorption, thus improving catalytic activity of pure FeWO4 [20]. The introduced S atoms into FeWO4 can enhance the interaction between the intermediate *OOH and FeWO4, benefitting to retain more active sites and promote the formation of FeO bonds. This is significantly favorable to reduce the bond of OO bonds and promote the OO bond breakage, thus making the ORR process easier [21,22]. In this work, the S doped FeWO4 embedded in multi-dimensional N doped carbon structure (S-FeWO4/NC) was constructed as ORR catalyst in zinc-air batteries by sulfur doping strategy (as illustrated in Scheme 1 ). The introduction of thiourea can form S doping in the crystal structure of FeWO4 and help to facilitate the formation of Fe–S bonds, disrupt and rearrange the electronic structure of FeWO4. The S-FeWO4/NC has a multi-dimensional carbon structure, a large degree of defects and an excellent ORR performance. Thus, the S-FeWO4/NC-based zinc-air battery presented excellent power density, specific capacity, and charging/discharging stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents and materials Tungstic acid (H2WO4, ≥99%), Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, ≥99%), thiourea (CH4N2S, ≥99%), urea (CH4N2O, ≥99%), aqueous ammonia (NH3·H2O), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, ≥99%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Bacterial fiber gel (dispersions, 0.65 wt%, with 1 wt% NaOH) was purchased from Guilin Qi Hong Technology Co. Ltd. (Guilin, China). Commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was procured from Alfa Assar Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Nafion (10 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh (Shanghai, China). All experiments used self-made deionized water purified by Millipore system (Massachusetts, USA). 2.2 Methods Preparation of S-FeWO4/NC: Graphite phase carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4) were obtained by high temperature thermal condensation of urea, according to the previously reported method [23]. The prepared g-C3N4 (0.1 g) was evenly dispersed in 10 mL deionized water under the action of ultrasound. After being ultrasonically treated for 1 h, thiourea (0.75 g) was added and sequentially treated with ultrasonic for 0.5 h and labeled as dispersed A. Bacterial fiber gel (10 g) was uniformly dispersed in 5 mL deionized water under the action of magnetic force and labeled as dispersed B. After, mixing 0.5 h, the dispersed A was added into dispersed B and stirred for 3 h. H2WO4 (1 mmol) was added to 10 mL ammonia under ultrasonic action until completely dissolved, then diluted to 100 mL and labeled as solution A. Solution B was 100 mL deionized water containing FeCl3·6H2O (2 mmol). The solution A (5 mL) and solution B (10 mL) was added into the dispersed B, then constantly stirred for 6 h for obtaining the hydrogel. Next, the hydrogel was freeze-dried to obtain the aerogel. To construct S-FeWO4/NC, the aerogel was transferred into a porcelain crucible with a cover, and then placed in a tube furnace for high temperature pyrolysis. Using high-purity argon as the protective gas, a two-step heating method was adopted. Firstly, the temperature in furnace was increased to 500 °C with 5 °C min−1 and held for 0.5 h, then unceasingly increased to 800 °C with 5 °C min−1 and keep for 0.5 h. The obtained black powder was dispersed into hydrochloric acid (1 M) and then stirred for 10 h. After washing to neutral with distilled water and being dried, the black powder was transferred into a crucible then in a small muffle furnace again, calcined at 800 °C for 10 min. Finally, the S-FeWO4/NC was constructed. Preparation of FeWO4/NC: The FeWO4/NC was prepared by the same method without adding thiourea. Preparation of NC and S-NC: The same as the experimental procedure of S-FeWO4/NC, NC was prepared without adding thiourea, FeCl3, H2WO4 and ammonia. In addition, S-NC was prepared by adding thiourea on the basis of NC. 2.3 Apparatus The phase and crystal structure of all samples were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker 6100, Germany) with Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was adopted to study the information of element composition, chemical state, and chemical bond of various materials (XPS, ESCALAB 250 xl, Thermo VG Scientific, USA) at 1 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200) was used to study the fine structure of the material and analyze the microscopic composition. Raman spectrometer (Raman, RTS2) was used to detect the degree of graphitization and defects of the sample. In-situ Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a Nicolet IS50 FT-IR. Electrochemical measurements were performed on the CHI 760 E workstation (CH instruments, Inc.) using a typical RRDE-3A rotator three electrode system.

The XRD patterns of S-NC and NC show only plane of graphitic carbon. No crystalline phases of other species are detected. All diffraction peaks of S-FeWO4/NC and FeWO4/NC are similar and can be unambiguously indexed to FeWO4 (PDF#74–1100) [24]. The main diffraction peak of S-FeWO4/NC is slightly negatively shifted, indicating that the doping of S leads to the lattice expansion of FeWO4 induced by the larger radius of S2– relative to O2– [25]. The Raman spectra results of all catalysts are shown in Fig. 1(b). Two signal peaks at ∼1350 cm−1 (D band) and ∼1600 cm−1 (G band) can be observed, which are related to degree of defects and graphitization, respectively [26–29]. Compared with FeWO4/NC, S-NC, and NC samples, S-FeWO4/NC displays the higher I D/I G value (1.04). The results indicate that the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst has more defect structures to expose the active sites, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of S-FeWO4/NC [30]. In Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. S1, FeWO4/NC and S-FeWO4/NC inherit nanosheet and nanofiber structure. S-FeWO4/NC exhibits a multi-dimensional carbon skeleton structure with nanofibers attached to nanosheets. FeWO4 nanoparticles of about 50 nm are evenly distributed on multi-dimensional carbon skeleton structure (Fig. 2b and c). The corresponding EDS mapping is shown in Fig. S2. Fe, W, S, N, O and C elements are evenly scattered on the multi-dimensional carbon structure. According to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of S-FeWO4/NC in Fig. 2(d and e), the nanoparticles show clearly indexed lattice fringes, exhibiting lattice spacings of 0.17 and 0.20 nm that match well with the (111) and (002) planes of FeWO4, respectively. The result is coincident with the XRD results of S-FeWO4/NC. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 2f) pattern shows a polycrystalline characteristic of S-FeWO4/NC. Furthermore, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning image (HAADF-STEM) reveals the uniform dispersion of FeWO4 nanoparticles on the carbon framework of S-FeWO4/NC. Noteworthily, the signal regions of Fe, W, O and S elements display obvious overlap (Fig. 2h and i and Fig. S3), indicating that S is successfully doped into FeWO4 nanoparticles. The bonding configuration and chemical composition of S-FeWO4/NC and FeWO4/NC were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 3 (a), Fe 2p spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC consists of four main components including Fe2+ (710.62 eV and 723.72 eV), Fe3+ (712.52 eV and 725.62 eV), corresponding satellite peaks (715.49 eV and 728.53 eV), and Fe–S peak (709.02 eV) [31–34]. Compared with FeWO4/NC, the Fe 2p spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC is positively shifted by about 0.4 eV. The electronegativity of S is greater than that of Fe, which means that S has a stronger ability to attract electrons. After the successful doping of S, the electronic state of the Fe site is changed. The electrons are transferred from Fe to S, resulting in a higher binding energy of Fe 2p. Finally, the electronic structure of FeWO4 is optimized [35–37]. Fig. 3(b) shows that S 2p XPS spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC, which is fitted into four sub peaks. The two peaks centered at 163.96 and 165.12 eV originate from S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2, respectively [38]. The signal peak at 168.42 eV is attributed to C–SO2–C. The peak centered at 162.02 eV assigns to the Fe–S structure [39]. The Fe–S coordination both in Fe 2p and S 2p spectra manifests that S atoms are embedded in the FeWO4 lattice. The W 4f XPS spectra of S-FeWO4/NC and FeWO4/NC in Fig. 3(c), the two peaks with peak centers at 35.41 eV and 37.58 eV associate with W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2, respectively [40]. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC in Fig. 3(d) is divided into four binding types. The main peak at 284.80 eV comes from the CC coordination in the C substrate of S-FeWO4/NC [41]. The signal peak around 285.72 eV corresponds to the CS bond [42]. The other two intermediate peaks at 286.69 and 289.12 eV are attributed to the CN and CO–C bonds [43]. In N 1s spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC (Fig. 3e), the three peaks at 398.42, 399.54 and 400.74 eV are attributed to pyridinic–N, pyrrolic–N and graphitic–N, respectively [44]. In Fig. 3(f), O 1s spectrum of S-FeWO4/NC can be divided into three peaks. The two peaks centered on 530.72 and 531.83 eV are attributed to the lattice oxygen in S-FeWO4/NC. The signal peak at 532.80 eV is assigned to the presence of oxygen or hydroxyl adsorbed on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC [45]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic features of S-FeWO4/NC for ORR As displayed in Fig. S4, the ORR activity of S-FeWO4/NC synthesized under different conditions (temperature and thiourea dosage) was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method to screen out the conditions corresponding to the best performance. When the amount of thiourea and the pyrolysis temperature are 0.75 g and 800 °C, respectively, the S-FeWO4/NC shows more positive half wave potential and limiting current density. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), S-FeWO4/NC shows a half-wave potential (0.85 V), which is more positive than FeWO4/NC (0.81 V), S-NC (0.72 V) and NC (0.72 V), and comparable to Pt/C (0.84 V). At the same time, S-FeWO4/NC has the maximum limit current density (5.29 mA cm−2), which is better than Pt/C (5.21 mA cm−2), FeWO4/NC (5.10 mA cm−2), S-NC (4.20 mA cm−2), and NC (4.02 mA cm−2). Through the analysis of the above performance indicators, the half wave potential of S-FeWO4/NC is 40 mV higher than that of FeWO4/NC, which proves the positive effect of S doping on the catalyst. In Fig. 4(b), compared with Pt/C (93.0 mV dec−1), FeWO4/NC (74.2 mV dec−1), S-NC (96.6 mV dec−1) and NC (118.6 mV dec−1), S-FeWO4/NC exhibits the smallest Tafel slope (59.1 mV dec−1), proving that S-FeWO4/NC possessed excellent ORR kinetics [46,47]. The LSV curves of S-FeWO4/NC, FeWO4/NC, Pt/C, S-NC and NC curves at different speeds are shown in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5. It was evident that the current density increases with the augmentation of the rotation speed. The inset of Fig. 4(c) shows the Koutecky-Levith (K-L) plot at different potentials. By calculating its slope, the number of electron transfers (n) for the ORR can be obtained. The average electron transfer number of S-FeWO4/NC at 0.2–0.8 V was 3.96. In addition, according to test results of the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in Fig. 4(d) and Fig. S6, the yield of hydrogen peroxide was less than 2.5%, and the electron transfer numbers were all greater than 3.95, which was in keeping with the results of the K-L equation. The chronoamperometry test (i–-t, Fig. 4e) results displayed that, after 10 h, S-FeWO4/NC still maintained 95.1% of the initial current, while FeWO4/NC and Pt/C only retained 84.7% and 81.0%, respectively. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of S-FeWO4/NC, FeWO4/NC, Pt/C, S-NC and NC were obtained based on the double-layer capacitance (C dl) by measuring the CV curves of different scanning speeds [48]. The C dl (25.4 mF cm−2) of S-FeWO4/NC (Fig. 4f) was higher than those of FeWO4/NC (13.8 mF cm−2), Pt/C (6.38 mF cm−2), S-NC (10.8 mF cm−2) and NC (9.03 mF cm−2). The increased capacitance performance of S-FeWO4/NC was mainly due to that the introduced S produced more carbon structural defects, which was beneficial to the exposure of active sites and promote ORR process [49]. Compared with similar tungsten-based catalysts (Table S1), S-FeWO4/NC has obvious advantages in electrocatalytic performance and stability. The adsorption-reduction process of O2 on S-FeWO4/NC and FeWO4/NC surfaces was investigated by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in-situ FT-IR). In situ FT-IR spectra were recorded by stepwise changing the potential from 1.077 to 0.377 V (vs. RHE) in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Through the online analysis of the oxygen reduction reaction process, various reaction processes at the electrode/interface and changes in the concentration of intermediate species can be accurately reflected. As shown in Fig. 5 , the main frequency bands at ∼1230 and ∼3600 cm−1 belong to the stretching vibration signals of *OOH and *OH, respectively [50]. In Fig. 5(a and b), the strength of the stretching vibration peak of *OOH gradually weakens from 0.977 to 0.777 V, and the signal basically disappears at 0.777 V. However, the stretching vibration peak of *OH is gradually enhanced in this voltage range. The peak signal of the stretching vibration of *OH is the strongest at 0.827 V. As the voltage gradually decreases in this potential range, O2 is gradually adsorbed and reduced to *OOH (*O2 + H2O + e− ↔ *OOH + OH−), and then reduced to *OH (*OOH + e− ↔ *O + OH−, *O + H2O + e−↔OH−+*OH). Until the potential drops to about 0.827–0.777 V, the oxygen reduction reaction is the most intense [51]. When oxygen is adsorbed on FeWO4/NC on the surface, the intensity of the stretching vibration peak of the intermediate *OOH gradually weakened from 0.977 to 0.727 V. The signal basically disappears at about 0.727 V. At the same time, the peak signal of the stretching vibration of *OH increases with the decrease of voltage, and is the strongest at 0.727 V, indicating that when O2 is first reduced to *OOH and then reduced to *OH intermediate, the potential needs to be reduced (*O2 + H2O + e− ↔ *OOH + OH−, *OOH + e− ↔ *O + OH−, *O + H2O + e− ↔ OH−+*OH) (Fig. 5c and d). The oxygen reduction reaction of FeWO4/NC is most intense at about 0.727 V, which is lower than that of the S-FeWO4/NC surface (about 0.827–0.777 V). The above results show that the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst can make the reduction reaction of O2 proceed in a narrow potential range, accelerate the reaction rate, thereby promoting the ORR process and increasing the half-wave potential [52]. Compared with pure FeWO4/NC, the position of the *OOH band on the S-FeWO4/NC surface is shifted to higher wavenumbers by about 3 cm−1 (Fig. S8). According to the simple harmonic motion relationship, the *OOH binding strength on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC was enhanced. Therefore, the adsorption of the intermediate *OOH on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC is stronger than that of FeWO4/NC, benefitting to retain more active sites and promote the formation of Fe−O bonds. This is significantly favorable to reduce the bond of OO bonds and promote the OO bond breakage, thus making the ORR process easier [53,54]. These all indicate the positive effect of S doping into FeWO4/NC on the ORR process. According to the above results, the main ORR activity and high stability of the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst are mainly due to the following factors. (1) The successful doping of S expands the lattice of FeWO4, resulting in the change of electronic states around the Fe atoms, which modulates the electronic structure of the FeWO4 active center and enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity. (2) The successful introduction of S enables the reduction and adsorption reactions of O2 on the surface of the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst in a narrow potential range, thereby promoting the ORR process and increasing the half-wave potential. (3) The multi-dimensional structure of S-FeWO4/NC is conducive to the transmission of O2 and electrons during the reaction. The multi-dimensional structure of S-FeWO4/NC is conducive to the transmission of O2 and electrons during the reaction. (4) Benefiting from the multidimensional carbon framework, the S-FeWO4 nanoparticles are protected from agglomeration and corrosion during prolonged catalysis. 3.3 Performance in zinc-air battery To practically prove catalytic performance of S-FeWO4/NC electrocatalyst, S-FeWO4/NC catalyst was served as air cathode to assemble zinc-air battery. The S-FeWO4/NC-based battery exhibits a higher discharge voltage and a smaller charge–discharge gap in Fig. 6 (a), implying favorable rechargeability. According to the discharge curves, S-FeWO4/NC-based battery exhibits a peak power density of 150.3 mW cm−2, which is superior to that of the Pt/C-based zinc-air battery (98.2 mW cm−2) and FeWO4/NC-based zinc-air battery (95.9 mW cm−2) (Fig. 6b and Fig. S9a). At the same time, S-FeWO4/NC-based battery can generate a specific capacity of 912.7 mA h g−1, vastly preferable the Pt/C-based and FeWO4/NC-based batteries (763.0 mA h g−1 and 829.2 mA h g−1) in Fig. 6(c) and Fig. S9(b). To evaluate the cycling stability, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. S-FeWO4/NC-based battery possesses better durability in comparison with the battery based on Pt/C. After 220 h of cycling (Fig. 6d), the round-trip voltage of the S-FeWO4/NC-based battery changes slightly. However, the charge–discharge voltages of the batteries equipped with Pt/C and FeWO4/NC fluctuate rapidly after a long cycle test of about 70 h (Fig. S9c). Furthermore, the peak power density, specific capacity, and long-term charge-discharge cycling performance of the zinc-air battery assembled by the S-FeWO4/NC electrocatalyst are comparable to those of the previously reported state-of-the-art tungsten-based catalysts (Table S2). The test results of the assembled zinc-air batteries above clearly reveal the immense potential of S-FeWO4/NC to replace Pt/C catalysts in zinc-air battery applications. 4 Conclusions In this work, we introduce sulfur doping strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performances of FeWO4 nanoparticles embedded into N-doped multi-dimensional carbon structures (S-FeWO4/NC) for ORR. In this specially designed ORR catalyst, the constructed multidimensional carbon structure enlarges the electron and mass transfer paths, improves the charge transfer rate, and provides protection for the embedded FeWO4 nanoparticles. After S doping, the adsorption reduction reaction of O2 on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC catalyst can be carried out in a narrow potential range. The process of oxygen reduction can be accelerated. Moreover, the introduction of S adjusts the electronic structure of the FeWO4 to improve the intrinsic ORR activity. The resultant S-FeWO4/NC displayed a half-wave potential of 0.85 V during oxygen reduction. After 10 h of timing current test, the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst still maintained 95.1% of its initial current density. Moreover, the liquid zinc-air battery assembled with S-FeWO4/NC catalyst as air–cathode active material displayed high power density (150.3 mW cm−2), high specific capacity (912.7 mA h g−1), and long cycle time (stable operation for over 220 h). In addition, this work provides an enhanced strategy to develop tungsten-based materials with combined characteristic of inexpensive as well as high-performance for ORR catalysis in zinc-air batteries.

        "dc:description": "The exploration of active and long-lived oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for the commercialization of zinc-air batteries are of immense significance but challenging. Herein, the sulfur doped FeWO4 embedded in the multi-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon structure (S-FeWO4/NC) was successfully synthesized. The doped S atoms optimized the charge distribution in FeWO4 and enhanced the intrinsic activity. At the same time, S doping accelerated the formation of reaction intermediates during the adsorption reduction of O2 on the surface of S-FeWO4/NC. Accordingly, the S-FeWO4/NC catalyst showed more positive half-wave potential (0.85 V) and better stability than that of the FeWO4/NC catalyst. Furthermore, the S-FeWO4/NC-based zinc-air battery exhibited considerable power density of 150.3 mW cm−2, high specific capacity of 912.7 mA h g−1 , and prominent cycle stability up to 220 h. This work provides an assistance to the development of cheap and efficient tungsten-based oxygen reduction catalysts and the promotion of its application in the zinc-air battery.",
