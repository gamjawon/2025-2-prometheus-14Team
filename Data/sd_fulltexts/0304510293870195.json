(+48-22)325276; e-mail: JERZY@ALFA.ICHF.EDU.PL (Received September 20, 1992; accepted February 2, 1993 ) Abstract Hydrogen reduction of surface nickel oxide, formed during the low temperature oxidation of nickel, was studied for a series of Ni/A1203 catalysts. The examinations were carried out mainly by the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method. The results obtained show that alumina considerably inhibits the reduction, especially when the reaction proceeds in the presence of water. Analysis of the results lead to conclusion that nonstoichiometric nickel aluminate decorates corners and edges of Ni crystallites. It is supposed that this decoration is responsible for the unique properties of Ni/A1203 catalysts, e.g. low ability of the catalysts to form Ni(CO)4 during the interaction with CO, and high thermal stability of nickel in the specimens with low alumina content. Key words: morphology of Ni/A1203; surface nickel oxide; temperature-programmed reduction Introduction The interaction of hydrogen with surface nickel oxide, [ Ni0 ] s, formed during low temperature oxidation of nickel, has been thoroughly examined for nickel films [ 1-3 ] and individual nickel crystallographic planes [4,5 ] , but only a little work has been performed on Ni powder [6,7] and Ni/A1203 catalysts [ 6-9 ] . The studies have showed that: (i) the interaction of hydrogen with preoxidized Ni films occurs at room temperature if at least a small amount of surface nickel, [ Ni ] e, is exposed; hydrogen is dissociatively adsorbed by the nickel, and is also fixed by surface oxygen [ 1-3 ] ; (ii) the reduction of [ Ni0 ] s formed on Ni (100) and Ni (111) planes proceeds via nucleation and growth type mechanisms [4,5]; (iii) the reduction of preoxidized Ni powder is easier than the reduction of NiO powder, and proceeds without an induction period [6,7]; (iv) the reduction of preoxidized Ni/A1203 catalysts appears difficult in comparison with the reduction of preoxidized Ni powder [6,7], and a significant difference is manifested when the reaction proceeds in the presence of 198 J. Zieliiiski/J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 water [ 7 ] ; it was supposed that [ Ni0 ] e reacts with vicinal alumina in the presence of water, forming surface nickel aluminate which is difficult to reduce [7]. This paper presents recent studies on the effect of alumina on hydrogen reduction of surface nickel oxide and forms part of a wider investigation of the morphology and chemical properties of Ni/A1203 catalysts. The experiments were carried out largely by the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method in the belief that the reducibility of the surface oxide reflects the morphology of Ni/A1203 catalyst surfaces. Experimental Apparatus The measurements were carried out in a glass flow system [ 10 ] equipped with a gradientless microreactor [ 11 ] . A temperature controller maintained the reactor temperature with 1 C accuracy over the range - 200 to + 800 C, and provided linear temperature programming. Composition of the stream leaving the reactor was measured by means of a TCD cell. Materials The investigations were carried out on a series of Ni/A1203 catalysts differing in preparation method and nickel loading. In this paper selected results obtained for the following specimens are presented. - Ni powder of high purity (over 99.999%) from Johnson Matthey, purified from traces of carbon by calcination in oxygen (500 C, 8 h). - 97.5, 85, and 10% Ni/A1203 catalysts, prepared from chemically pure reactants. The high-nickel specimens were obtained by coprecipitation from Ni (N03) 2 and NiA102 aqueous solutions [ 12 ] . The precipitate was washed, spray dried, and calcined in air (400 C, 2 h). The low-nickel specimen was obtained by impregnation of alumina powder with an aqueous solution of Ni (N03) 2 [ 10 ] . The stirred suspension was evaporated to dryness and calcined as the high-nickel specimens. The calcined materials were prereduced in an HZ stream (40 cm'/min) under linearly increasing temperature (8.3 C/min) from room temperature to 400 C for Ni powder, and to 500 C for Ni/A203 catalysts, whereupon the reduction was continued for a further 2 h. Dispersion of nickel in the specimens was calculated from the amount of 02 chemisorbed at 0 C, assuming that the O/Nio ratio reached 1.7 [10,13]. The catalysts examined are characterized in Table 1. Measurements After prereduction, the examined sample was flushed with an He stream (40 cm3/min, 400 C, 0.5 h), and then oxidized. The oxidation was performed typically at 0 C, admitting 28.5 mm3 02 pulses into the He stream flowing over J. Zieliicski/J. Mol.

After cooling the sample to -50 C, the He stream was replaced with an 80% H2+Ar mixture (40 cm'/min). The reactor temperature was then linearly increased (at 8.3 C/ min; to 400 C for Ni powder, and to 500 C for Ni/A1203 ), and the consumption of hydrogen by the mixture was measured. In view of the fact that water affects the reduction of preogidized Ni/A1203 catalysts [ 7 ] ,two versions of the TPR test were carried out in parallel: - at decreased (minimum) concentration of water vapour (TPR-\"' test); - at increased concentration of water vapour (TPR+\"' test). The decrease of H20 concentration was attained by admixing alumina powder with the sample studied [ 7,12 ] . The alumina sorbed water produced during the reduction, and thereby decreased H20 concentration below 1 ppm. On the other hand, an increase of H20 concentration was accomplished by adsorption of water vapour on the preogidized sample, passing an He stream saturated with water at 0 C over the sample maintained at 0 C. In the case of the isothermal measurements, Ni powder was preogidized at 0 or 100 C, and the reduction was carried at a temperature within the 7090 C range. The reduction was performed in an H2 stream (40 CM3 /min), and the reaction rate was followed by the measurement of H20 evolution. These examinations were supplemented by disturbance-response measurements [ 14 ] which consisted of following the effect of temporary deviations of temperature and H20 concentration on the reduction rate. The temperature was varied by no more than 5 C, and the changes in H20 concentration were caused by variations of H2 flow rate from the basic value of 40 cm'/min to 20 or 80 cm'/min. Results Preoxidation of nickel The low temperature oxidation of nickel leads to the formation of a surface nickel oxide [ 4,5,15-18 ] . At 0 and 100 C the thickness of the oxide layer corresponds to an O/Nis ratio of about 1.7 and 2.5, respectively. The newly formed oxide is not stable and may rearrange to a more stable product (s) ; in particu- 200 J. Zieliriski/J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 lar, above 200 C the oxide may transform to bulk NiO and an oxygen-onnickel structure [ 19 ] . It seems that some stabilization also occurs during a regular TPR test, affecting the recorded TPR spectrum. In contrast to that test, the rearrangement was presumably less significant during those isothermal examinations, in which the reduction temperature was below the preogidation temperature. Isothermal reduction of pre-oxidized Ni powder Fig. 1 presents a typical profile of the isothermal reduction of [ Ni0 ] e formed on Ni powder. The reduction starts just after hydrogen is passed over the sample, and the reaction rate subsequently decreases. Mathematical analysis of the isothermal and disturbance-response measurements shows that the reduction of preogidized Ni powder may be expressed by an empirical equation, analogous to the equation found for Ni (100) and Ni (111) planes [ 4,5 ] r=F e-EIRT (1) where r=reaction rate; E-activation energy which equals (i) 12 1 kcal/mol for the sample preogidized at 0 C, close to the values reported for Ni (100) and Ni (111) planes [ 4,5 ] and for Ni powder [ 6 ] , and (ii) 23 1 kcal/mol for the sample preogidized at 100 C, close to the value reported for NiO powder [ 6 ] ; F= a factor which depends on H2 pressure and the reduction degree, different from the factors found for Ni planes [4,5 ] .

Isothermal reduction of preogidized Ni powder. J. Zieliriski/J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 201 The above results suggest that: - a considerable amount of surface nickel, [ Ni ] e, exists/emerges at the beginning of the reduction of preoxidized nickel powder, and induces the process; and - the reduction of [ Ni0 ] e formed on Ni powder at 0 C proceeds according to the same chemical mechanism as the reduction of preoxidized Ni (100) and Ni (111) planes [4,5 ] . TPR of preoxidized Ni powder Figs. 2 and 3 present the TPR spectra obtained for preoxidized Ni powder. The TPR-\"' spectrum (Fig. 2) exhibits several peaks of hydrogen consumption, indicating successive stages of the process. Consumption of hydrogen proceeds from the very beginning of the test, and supplementary examinations showed that about 5% of the total HZ uptake was adsorbed strongly at - 50 C, before the temperature rise. The net consumption of hydrogen (Fig. 2) terminates at 150-200 C, and above that temperature the volume of H2 desorbing o >3 ~ 0.8 o Ni powder ~~ - consumption of H2 --- evolution of H20 l c' 0. 4 0: 1 % 1 d I .. 1 i -100 0 100 200 300 temperature , `C Fig. 2.

Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 from nickel approximately balances the volume of HZ reacting with remnant oxygen. The occurrence of strong adsorption of hydrogen at - 50 C implies that [ Ni ] e sites which are capable of dissociative adsorption of hydrogen exist on preoxidized Ni powder. According to the previous studies [ 1-3 ] , appearing H atoms are fixed not only by [ Ni ] e sites but also by preadsorbed oxygen, forming hydroxyl groups. The groups react at a higher temperature producing H20 molecules, and creating further [ Ni ] a sites. A complementary examination showed that during the TPR test water starts to evolve at approximately 35 C, and at a higher temperature the rate of evolution of water parallels the rate of consumption of hydrogen (Fig. 2). Supplementary TPR-' tests showed that an increase of preoxidation temperature for the Ni powder diminishes the reducibility of the [ Ni0 ] 8 formed. The spectra obtained exhibit suppressed a- and ss-HZ peaks, and an enlarged y-H2 peak at higher temperature. Finally, after preoxidation of Ni powder at 400 C, in spite of the incompleteness of the oxidation, the recorded spectrum presents a single peak at 230 C, characteristic of the temperature-programmed reduction of NiO powder [ 10 ] . The TPR+\"' spectrum obtained for preoxidized Ni powder (Fig. 3) exhibits a minute profle of H2 evolution at -50 to 0 C, and a large profile of HZ consumption at 35-150 C. This spectrum indicates that: - at - 50 to 0 C added water oxidizes existing [ Ni ] e sites which results in the evolution of hydrogen and suppression of a- and ss-HZ peaks (Fig. 3 ); - above 35 C the reduction of [ Ni0 ] s in the presence of water (Fig. 3) proceeds similarly as in the absence of water (Fig. 2) . TPR of preoxidiaed Ni/A1203 catalysts The TPR-w spectra obtained for preoxidized Ni/A1203catalysts (Fig. 4) differ from those recorded for preoxidized Ni powder (Fig. 2) . The spectra exhibit suppressed a- and ss-H2 peaks, and large y-H2 peak at 80-100 C; in 0.8 e 0 U v a 0.4 o a 0 0 ~- -100 Ni/A1203 97.5 0 100 200 300 temperature , C Fig. 4.

Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 203 addition, the shape of the y-HZ peak clearly changes with alumina content. Complementary examinations showed that preoxidized 85% Ni/A1203 specimen adsorbed no hydrogen P+. - 50 C, implying that no [ Ni ] e sites existed on that sample. The TPR-w spectra obtained for preoxidized Ni/A1203 catalysts (Fig. 4 ) resemble the spectra recorded for Ni powder preoxidized at 50-150 C. The similarity might suggest that the effect of alumina on the reduction of [ Ni0 ] g is in fact brought about by an increase in temperature of small Ni crystallites in the catalysts during their preoxidation [ 20 ] . The supposition, however, seems improbable inasmuch as complementary TPR-w tests on a preoxidized 25% Ni/Si02 specimen (Euro-Ni) [21], of equally high Ni dispersion, evidenced significant consumption of hydrogen at - 50 C, implying presence of [ Ni ] e sites in that specimen. Therefore, it seems that the, absence of [ Ni ] e sites in Ni/A1203 catalysts is brought about by the alumina support. Supplementary examinations performed for 85% Ni/A1203 showed that an increase in the preoxidation temperature affects the TPR-\"' spectra similarly as was found for Ni powder: the H2 consumption peak enlarges and shifts towards a higher temperature. Finally, after preoxidation at 400 C, the recorded spectrum exhibits a prominent peak at 230 C, characteristic of the TPR of NiO powder, and a small peak at ca. 450 C, which is ascribed to the reduction of a nickel aluminate [ 10 ] . The TPR+\"' tests of preoxidized Ni/A1203 catalysts (Fig. 5) showed that water considerably increases the inhibiting effect of alumina on the reduction of [Ni0]8. Complementary studies showed that a minute amount of added water causes full enhancement of the effect, e.g. merely 0.1,umol of water induces the full effect of alumina on the reduction of 1 umol of [ Ni0 ] e formed on an 85% Ni/A1203 sample. This fact implies that a small fraction of [Ni0]$ formed on Ni/A1203 catalysts readily transforms to [Ni]e sites which induce the reduction process. The TPR tests show that the transformation is relatively easy in the absence of water and difficult in the presence of water. o 85 o0.8 Ni/A1203 ;- 10 a 97, 5 a) 0.4 o ar .r 0 L 0 -100 0 100 200 300 temperature , C Fig. 5.

Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 Discussion The studies on the reduction of preoxidized Ni powder (Figs. 1, 2) indicate that a large amount of surface nickel appears on this sample at the very beginning of the measurements, and induces the reduction process. Accepting the evidence established for Ni (100) and Ni (111) planes [ 4,5 ] , that the reduction of [ Ni0 ] e proceeds according to nucleation and lateral growth mechanism, the profile of isothermal reduction of preoxidized Ni powder (Fig. 1) implies that the surface nickel forms linear sites, presumably on the edges of preoxidized crystallites. The reduction rate therefore attains a high value at the very beginning, and subsequently decreases. At the same time it seems that the effect of alumina on the reduction of [ Ni0 ] e formed on Ni crystallites in Ni/A1203 catalysts is connected with indirect action of alumina species on the [ Ni ] e sites. The presence of alumina species at/on Ni crystallites of Ni/A1203 catalysts has been suspected for a number of years [ 10,22,23 ] , and recently this fact was explicitly demonstrated by Lamber et al. [ 24 ] . Using a transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer they demonstrated that Ni crystallites in their Ni/A1203 specimens were covered by a shell of nonstoichiometric nickel aluminate. Considering these studies [ 24 ], it seems that a large volume of the aluminate appeared on Ni crystallites in their samples due to severe precalcination (500 C,100 h) of the Ni0/A1203 precursors. During that calcination a significant amount of nickel aluminate was produced, and during prereduction a thick layer of nonreduced aluminate remained/appeared on the Ni crystallites. In contrast to the specimens examined by Lamber et al. [24], on the basis of all of the studies of Ni/A1203 catalysts it seems that Ni crystallites in common Ni/A1203 catalysts are partly covered with nonreduced residues, and these residues decorate/block selected sites of Ni crystallites. Fig. 6 presents an image of the distribution of nickel aluminate decorations on Ni crystallites in the Ni/A1203specimens examined in this work. This distribution is proposed on the basis of the above studies on the effect of alu- 97.5% Ni/A1203 85%Ni/A1203 10%Ni/A1203 Fig. 6.

In the illustrations it has been assumed that nickel forms regular crystallites, and the aluminate forms amorphous decorants. Supplementary calculations of the free surface energy of the systems (Fig. ?) showed that the location of the decorant on an edge is energetically more favorable than on a plane. The models presented in Fig. 6 seem to explain the TPR spectra recorded for preoxidized Ni/A1203 catalysts (Figs. 4, 5 ). (i) 97.5% NiAI203. Ni crystallites in this specimen exhibit a fairly large fraction of nondecorated edges, and thereby a large quantity of [ Ni ] e sites after preozidation. Therefore both TPR-\"' and TPR+\"' spectra obtained for this sample (Figs. 4, 5 ) resemble those recorded for Ni powder (Figs. 1, 2 ). (ii) 85% Ni/A1203. In this specimen Ni crystallites exhibit small fraction of undecorated edges, and thereby small quantity of [ Ni ] e sites after preoxidation. Therefore the reduction of [Ni0]s formed on this specimen proceeds according to the model consisting of point nucleation and lateral growth, and the recorded TPR spectra are represented by a sharp peak of hydrogen consumption (Figs. 4, 5). (iii) 10% Ni/A1203. In this specimen the edges of Ni crystallites are completely covered by aluminate decorants. Therefore this specimen does not exhibit any [ Ni ] a sites after preoxidation, and during the TPR test the reduction starts when some [Ni]e sites appear. Considering the effect of water on the TPR spectra (Figs. 4, 5), it seems that: 205 206 J. Zieliriski/J Mol. Catal. 83 (1993)197-206 - during the TPR-' tests, the [ Ni ] s sites appear at [ Ni0 ] e-decorant boundary, when preadsorbed oxygen atoms creep under the decorants; - during the TPR+\"' test, in the presence of water the boundary [ Ni0 ] a reacts with vicinal alumina, forming a stable boundary surface nickel aluminate [ 7 ] . Consequently, the [ Ni ] a sites appear on the open [ Ni0 ] s layer, at a temperature comparable with temperature of the reduction of NiO powder [ 10 ] . The decoration of Ni crystallites with aluminate species (Fig. 6) appears to explain other properties of Ni/A1203 catalysts as well. For example, it seems, that the decoration of edges of Ni crystallites with aluminate residues is responsible for the low ability of the catalysts to form Ni (CO) 4 during interaction with CO. It is also supposed that the decorant fixed on edges and corners of Ni crystallites participate in supporting the high dispersion of nickel in Ni/ A1203 catalysts with a low alumina content.

Kasprzaka 44/52, 01-224 Warsaw Poland; tel. (+48-22)323221 ext. 353, fax. (+48-22)325276 1 JERZY&@;ALFA.ICHF.EDU.PL Hydrogen reduction of surface nickel oxide, formed during the low temperature oxidation of nickel, was studied for a series of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. The examinations were carried out mainly by the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) method. The results obtained show that alumina considerably inhibits the reduction, especially when the reaction proceeds in the presence of water. Analysis of the results lead to conclusion that nonstoichiometric nickel aluminate decorates corners and edges of Ni crystallites. It is supposed that this decoration is responsible for the unique properties of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, e.g. low ability of the catalysts to form Ni (CO)4 during the interaction with CO, and high thermal stability of nickel in the specimens with low alumina content.
