Lunsford a, D. Wayne Goodman a,* Alak Bhattacharyya b a Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M Universi~, College Station, TX 77843, USA b Amoco Research Center, Naperville, IL 60566, USA Received 15 February 1996; revised 1 July 1996; accepted 6 July 1996 Abstract The catalytic conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME) has been studied over a series of solid-acid catalysts, such as 7-A1203, H-ZSM-5, amorphous silica-alumina, as well as titania modified zirconia. All the catalysts are active and selective for DME formation. The apparent activation energy for DME formation over -y-A1203 is ca. 25 kcal/mol, a value that increases to ca. 37 kcal/mol upon the addition of 23 Torr of H20 to the reagent. The rate of methanol dehydration decreases with increasing acidity (silica content) over the amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Although H-ZSM-5 with Si/AL = 25 is the most active among the catalysts tested, the DME selectivity is only 20% at 280, a typical temperature used in the syngas-to-methanol process. An amorphous silica-alumina catalyst with 20 wt.-% silica content (SIRAL20) exhibits the best catalytic performance of those tested at 280. Keywords: Solid acid; Methanol; Dimethyl ether 1. Introduction Dimethyl ether (DME), a natural gas derived product [1], is a useful building block for making important chemicals, including dimethyl sulfate and high-value oxygenated compounds. DME is also used as an aerosol propellant in products such as hair spray and shaving cream because of its environmentally benign properties and the belief that chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) harm the ozone layer. Furthermore, DME has been suggested recently as an alternative fuel for diesel * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 Copyright 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Preliminary engine tests indicate that with minor fuel system modifica- tion, engine operation with thermal efficiencies equivalent to traditional diesel fuel can be achieved with much lower NOx emission, near-zero smoke produc- tion, and less engine noise [2,3]. In view of DME's potential as an alternative, clean diesel fuel, consideration should be given to the production of DME in large quantities. Presently, DME is made in small quantities by the catalytic dehydration of methanol over an acidic catalyst, e.g., pure or phosphoric-acid modified T-A1203 [6]. However, DME will cost much more to manufacture via this process since methanol itself is an expensive chemical feedstock. Recently, researchers at Halder Topsoe have reported that the addition of specially treated H-ZSM-5 to the traditional Cu/ZnO/A1203 methanol synthesis catalyst promotes the formation of DME from syngas [4,5]. Ether synthesis from alcohol is known to be an acid catalyzed reaction; however, one of the undesirable products is hydrocarbons. The treat- ment of HZSM-5 with ammonia, which presumably poisons the strong acid sites, prevents the formation of hydrocarbons and increases the catalytic stabil- ity. Thermodynamically, DME production from syngas is more favorable than methanol, thus, in principle, the cost for DME production from syngas should be less than that of methanol provided a suitable catalyst can be found. The process of methanol production from synthesis gas has been used successfully for several decades, and the reaction mechanism and the role of each active ingredient of the catalyst have been well studied. In contrast to methanol synthesis, the catalytic dehydration of methanol to DME has received less attention. As reported in the literature, methanol dehydration takes place readily on pure or phosphoric-acid modified T-A1203 catalysts [6]. It has been reported that a 1 wt.-% titania-modified y-A1203 catalyst yields an even better performance by increasing the dehydration rate, minimizing coke formation, and reducing the amount of byproducts compared with a phosphoric acid-alumina catalyst [7]. However the optimum operating temperature over titania modified T-A1203 is ca. 400, which is considerably higher than the temperature employed in the syngas-to-methanol process. Extensive studies on methanol dehydration, mainly over T-A1203, have been carried out to address the reaction mechanism. KniSzinger and co-workers [8,9] have proposed that ether formation takes place via a surface reaction between the adsorbed alcohol molecule on an acidic site and an adsorbed alkoxide anion on a basic site. A similar reaction mechanism has been proposed by Jain and Pillai [10]. This mechanism has also found support from a Monte Carlo simulation study of Dabrowski et al. [11], in which these authors have suggested that a Lewis acid-base pair is responsible for ether formation. The participation of both acidic and basic sites has been demonstrated by site-specific poisoning experiments. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of various solid-acid catalysts for methanol dehydration to DME as part of the long-range goal of M. Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 291 developing an integrated (or hybrid) catalyst for producing methanol directly from syngas. Accordingly, the catalytic dehydration of methanol to DME was performed over a series of solid acid catalysts. The relationship between catalytic activity for methanol-to-DME and the acid-base property of the catalysts were investigated over amorphous silica-alumina and titania-modified ZrO2 catalysts. These catalysts were evaluated at a range of temperatures including the typical methanol-synthesis temperatures, i.e., 280, in order to find the most suitable candidate for the methanoi-to-DME step in a future integrated syngas-to-DME catalyst. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts A 50 mol-% TiO2/ZrO2 catalyst was prepared by adding aqueous ammonia or sodium hydroxide slowly to an ethanol solution of TiC14 and ZrCI4 while stirring until the pH of the mother liquor reached ca. 8.0. The precipitate thus obtained was filtered and washed until no chlorine ions were detected by aqueous AgNO3. The resulting material was then dried at I I0 overnight and calcined at 550 for 3.5 h. The same procedure applied to the preparation of pure TiO2 and ZrO2. 1.0 wt.-% TiO2/A1203 was obtained by adding the appropriate amount of TiC14 to a slurry of T-AI203 (Condea Company, Ger- many), followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of either ammonia or sodium hydroxide to bring the pH to 8.0. The material thus obtained was dried at 110 and calcined in air at 550 for 3.5 h. The catalysts obtained with aqueous ammonia and NaOH as precipitates were designated as NHJ- TiO2/A1203 and Na+-TiOz/AI203, respectively. Amorphous silica-alumina (SIRAL) catalysts with different silica content were provided by Condea Com- pany in Germany. The ZSM-5 zeolites in the ammonia form were supplied by Conteka (CBV5020 and CBV1502), and had bulk SiO2/A120~ ratios of 50 and 150. Girdler T-126 T-A1203 (Chemtron Corp.) were used as received. 2.2. Reactor system The reaction was carried out in a plug-flow reactor constructed of fused quartz. The upper section of the reactor, which contained the catalyst, was 10 mm i.d., while the lower section consisted of a 1 mm i.d. capillary tube. The smaller diameter tube allowed the products to pass rapidly out of the heated zone. Quartz chips (20-42 mesh) were placed on the inlet side of the catalyst bed in order to preheat the reactants. A thermocouple inside a capillary well was located at the level of the catalyst on the outside of the reactor. Helium and air flows were regulated by mass flow controllers (Brooks, Model 5850). Doubly 292 M. Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 deionized water was introduced by using a syringe pump (Model 341A, Sage Instrument). The exit of the pump line was maintained in contact with the inner wall of the preheated gas inlet tube, ensuring the steady flow of water into reactor. Helium make-up gas was introduced through a third line in order to keep the total gas flow constant at different water partial pressures. 2.3. Procedure and analysis In a typical experiment, 0.51 g of catalyst (20-42 mesh), supported between two layers of quartz wool, was activated in flowing air (ca. 40 ml/min) at 550 for 1 h. The air was then replaced by He (Airco, UHP), and the sample was lowered to the desired temperature in a flow of He (ca. 60 ml/min). At this temperature, methanol (Aldrich, A.C.S. HPLC grade) was fed by bubbling helium through two saturators connected in series at 22.5 + 0.5. The effluent was analyzed on-line by means of a Varian Model 3400CX gas chromatograph that was coupled with a Varian Model 4270 integrator. The product stream was separated on a super Q column in series with a Porapak Q column obtained from Alltech Associates, Inc. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to detect reaction products. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. y-Ale 03 The effect of temperature on the catalytic activity of a T-A1203 (Girdler, T-126) catalyst is depicted in Fig. 1. The partial pressure of methanol was kept constant at ca. 116 Torr. A conversion level of ca. 6.3% was achieved at 100 80 ~9. 60 40 20 i i I I i I 150 200 250 Temperature, Fig. 1.

Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 293 temperatures as low as 150, and the conversion increased exponentially with an increase in temperature from 150 to 200. The conversion rolled over at the elevated temperatures, reaching the thermodynamically limiting regime at 250; DME and water were the only reaction products. Since the reaction is exother- mic, further increase in temperature is expected to lower the DME equilibrium yield. A blank experiment was carried out with only quartz chips in the reactor, and it was found that with 81.4 Torr of methanol, a total flow of 67.2 ml/min, and at 400, the level of methanol conversion was only 0.8%. It is apparent that the contribution from homogeneous reactions is negligible under these reaction conditions. Water, which is one of the reaction products, is believed to block the active sites for methanol consumption through competitive adsorption with methanol on the catalyst surface. To determine the effect of water on catalytic activity over T-AI203, the partial pressure of methanol was kept constant at 81.4 Torr, and different amounts of water were added to the gas stream. As shown by the results of Fig. 2, water partial pressure has a large negative effect on the catalytic activity for DME formation. With the addition of 23 Torr of H20 into the reagent stream, methanol conversion decreased from 17.5% to 5.8% at 188. Apparently, in the presence of excess water, a higher reaction tempera- ture is required in order to achieve the same level of conversion. For example, 10% methanol conversion was attained at 180 without the addition of water in the reagent stream; however, in the presence of 113 Torr of H20, the same level of conversion was achieved at about 225, and only reached 39% at 250.

Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 The large amount of water produced in both methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration reactions clearly will retard the methanol dehydration activity. Fortunately, the current commercial methanol synthesis catalyst, i.e., Cu/ZnO/AI203, a likely component of a syngas-to-DME hybrid catalyst, is also active for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Thus, excess water, upon formation in a future integrated syngas-to-DME catalyst, will be removed via the WGS reaction. The kinetic data of Fig. 2 were obtained under nearly differential conditions, i.e., methanol conversion was kept below 20%, therefore, the effect of water on Ea, the apparent activation energy, for methanol consumption can be determined. Without the addition of H20 in the gas stream, the partial pressure of H20 at the reactor exit increased from 2 Torr to approximately 8 Torr over the temperature range 168-191; Ea was near 25 kcal/mol. A similar Ea has been reported for diethyl ether formation from ethanol over T-AI203 in the tempera- ture range 175-227 [11]. It is noteworthy that Ea for DME formation over Pd supported on metal oxides is 24.0 _+ 0.5 kcal/mol, and does not depend strongly on the nature of the support [12]. The addition of H20 increased Ea to 37 kcal/mol, presumably due to the blocking by water of the active catalytic sites. At high water coverages, the heat of adsorption of water on \"y-Al203 is known to be approximately 16 kcal/mol [13], consistent with the observed increase in Ea for DME formation upon the addition of water. Lewis acid-Lewis base pairs, formed during surface dehydration, are neces- sary for the catalytic activity of T-AI203. Strong acid sites are required for the dehydration of alcohols to olefins, while relatively weak sites are active for ether formation [14,15]. The participation of basic site has been proved using tetracya- noethylene (TCNE), which specifically poisons the basic sites [16]. The present experimental results indicate that CO2, a weak acid, has no effect on the rate of methanol dehydration though the partial pressure of CO2 employed was nearly three times the partial pressure of CH3OH. This suggests the absence of highly basic, active sites on the T-AI203 surface. 3.2. TiO2//Al203 1.0 wt.-% TiO2/A1203, prepared by coprecipitation of sodium aluminate and TiC14 with hydrochloric acid, exhibits enhanced activity and stability compared to the commonly used phosphoric acid-alumina catalyst [7]. Although thor- oughly washed with deionized water during preparation, the catalyst is believed to still contain large amounts of Na+ ions. The presence of Na+ ions could alter the acid-base property of the catalyst [14,17]. The catalytic results obtained over NH~--TiO2/AI203 and Na+-TiO2/A1203 could provide information about the role of Na+ ions. Experimental results reveal that NH~--TiOz/AI203 is much more active than Na+-TiO2/AI203. For example, 42% methanol conversion was achieved over M.

Yet NH]-- TiO2/A1203 exhibits comparable activity to \"y-A1203, as shown in Table 1, indicating the similarity of acid-base properties between these two catalysts. The addition of Na + ions could reduce the number of acid sites and, especially, could eliminate the strong acid sites [14,17]. Strong acid sites are known to promote the polymerization of olefins and increase the rate of coke formation. Formation of coke on the catalyst surface subsequently blocks the active sites and shortens the lifetime of the catalyst. Thus, Na+-TiO2/A1203 is expected to be more stable than NH~--TiO2/A1203. As shown in Table 1, this is indeed the case. By optimizing the sodium ion content, it is possible to obtain a Na+- TiO2/A1203 catalyst having high activity and stability for methanol dehydration in the methanol-synthesis temperature range, i.e., 260-300. 3.3. 770e / ZrO2 Zirconium oxide has weaker acidic sites but stronger basic sites, and exhibits a smaller concentration of acid sites than \"y-A1203 [18]. As depicted in Fig. 3, ZrO2 is much less active in methanol conversion compared with T-AI203. A conversion level of 41% was achieved at 325 with a DME selectivity greater than 99%. Only trace amounts of CO and CH4 were observed in the product stream. Yet the same level of conversion could be obtained at temperatures as low as 190 over T-A1203. Pure TiO2 exhibits an even lower activity than ZrO2. However, a 50 mol-% TiO2/ZrO2 catalyst shows enhanced activity over either pure component. The same trend has also been observed for the non- oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene [19]. Based on the fact 296 M.

It is evident that the catalytic activity increases with increasing surface acidity of the catalyst, as shown by the results of Fig. 4, indicating the role acid sites play in the catalytic dehydration of methanol to DME. 50 ~ ~ , , , , 2.0 ~, 4O .., 1.5 1.0 N a0 0 ~ ~ f ~ ~ ~ 0.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 TiO2, mol% Fig. 4.

H-ZSM-5 In the considerable work on the Mobil methanol-to-gasoline process, DME has been proposed to be a reaction intermediate. DME is then believed to undergo subsequent reactions via strong Brensted acid sites to form light olefins over H-ZSM-5. The pretreatment of H-ZSM-5 yields a stable catalyst for ether formation. Unlike T-A1203, which exhibits only Lewis acidity, H-ZSM-5 (50) has both Lewis (due to the extra-framework aluminum) and Brensted acid sites [20,21]; however, the number of Brensted acid sites is greater than the Lewis acid sites. Addition of water, as depicted in Fig. 5, has a negative effect on the catalytic activity of H-ZSM-5 (50); however, the effect is not as apparent as for \"y-A1203. For example, with the addition of 46 Torr of H20, methanol conver- sion decreased from 13.0% to 8.3% at 130 over H-ZSM-5 (50), and decreased from 17.5% to 2.7% at 188.5 over T-A1203. The slight decrease in activity over H-ZSM-5 (50) indicates the roles that Brensted and Lewis acid sites play in the reaction. This follows since water reduces the number of Lewis acid sites, yet has little effect on the Brensted acid sites. In other words, if Brensted acid sites are the only active sites, the addition of water will not affect the catalytic activity. By analogy, the activity of H-ZSM-5 (50) should decrease dramatically with the addition of water if Lewis acid sites are the only active sites. A H-ZSM-5 (150) catalyst with a Si/A1 ratio of 75, which is active and selective for the catalytic dehydration of methanol, exhibits only Brensted acid since there is no extra-framework aluminum. The addition of water into the reagent stream, as depicted in Fig. 5, has little effect on the activity of H-ZSM-5 (150). The apparent activation energy for methanol conversion over H-ZSM-5 (150), unlike 298 M. Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 that over H-ZSM-5 (50) or T-A1203 catalysts, remained essentially unchanged with increasing water partial pressure. H-ZSM-5 (50) has been found to be the most active among the catalysts tested so far. For example, approximately 78% methanol conversion with 100% DME selectivity was achieved at 190. However, the same catalyst pretreated with 2 mol-% ammonia in He at 525 gives only 58% methanol conversion at 190. Ammonia is believed to be irreversibly adsorbed on the strong acid sites of zeolite since its activity remained unchanged at 190 after the reaction was run at progressively higher temperatures. H-ZSM-5 (150) is much less active due to its low acid site density. The pretreatment of this catalyst with NH3 reduced methanol conversion from 28% to 20% at 190. As the reaction temperature was increased to 280, both ammonia-treated and untreated HZSM-5 (150) yielded about 90% methanol conversion. DME selectivity varied widely, increasing from 20% for the untreated catalyst to 98% for the ammonia- treated catalyst. 3.5. SiO2/A1203 Amorphous silica-alumina exhibits both BrCnsted and Lewis acid sites. The number of acid sites for the amorphous silica-alumina used in the present study increased from 1.0- 10-3 nmol/m2 to 2.0. 10-3 nmol/m2 as the silica content increased from 1.5 to 40 wt.-%. All the catalysts were tested in the temperature range of 140-190, so that kinetic data could be obtained under nearly differential conditions. Surprisingly, the methanol conversion decreased with increasing silica content, as shown in Fig. 6. The apparent activation energy for methanol consumption was found to be 25 _ 2 kcal/mol over all the amorphous silica-alumina catalysts, consistent with the Ea'S obtained over \"y-A1203, sug- gesting the involvement of the same acid site. The decrease of catalytic activity with increasing Si/A1 ratio could be a result of several factors. First, the number of Lewis acid sites could be reduced because of their facile transformation to BrOnsted acid sites under reaction conditions. Second, the number of basic sites may decrease due to increasing acidity. The acid-base pair is assumed to be the active site for methanol dehydration. Amorphous silica-alumina catalyst, even with the presence of strong acid sites, are very selective for DME formation over a wide range of temperature. No byproducts such as CO, CH4 and higher hydrocarbons were detected. It is possible that these very strong acid sites could be blocked by coke formed in the first few minutes of reaction. As will be discussed in the following section, amorphous silica-aluminas are relatively stable for long reaction periods. 3.6. Catalytic stability To study the catalytic stability, all the catalysts of interest were tested at a methanol conversion level between 60 and 70%, well below the thermodynamic M. Xu et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 149 (1997) 289-301 299 equilibrium-controlled regime. Due to different activities among catalysts, vari- ous reaction temperatures were employed to achieve the same level of methanol conversion. As shown in Table 1, all the catalysts experienced an initial deactivation in the first 10 h. 1 wt.-% NaTiO2/ZrO2, SIRAL1.5 and SIRAL 5 remained stable for 40 h; however, the activities of the other catalysts continued to decline. As mentioned above, the syngas-to-DME process developed by Topsoe proceeds at approximately 280 and involves two reaction steps. First, syngas is transformed to methanol over a Cu/ZnO/A1203 catalyst. Second, methanol undergoes dehydration to form DME over a solid acid catalyst, i.e., H-ZSM-5. Since the ultimate goal of this work is an integrated catalyst for a syngas-to-DME process, the catalytic reaction of methanol to DME was carried out in the syngas-to-methanol temperature range of 260-300. All the catalysts except Na+-TiO2/A1203 listed in Table 1 are sufficiently active to achieve equilibrium methanol conversion, i.e., 90%. Here we used a terminology called temperature tolerance to describe the catalytic performance. Temperature tolerance is defined as the temperature range in which approximately 90% equilibrium methanol conversion and 100% DME selectivity can be achieved. Beyond this range, either methanol conversion or DME selectivity will decline. As shown in Fig. 7, HZSM-5 (150) has the least temperature tolerance, i.e., ca. 10. Ammonia treatment shifts the lower and upper limits to 265 and 280, respectively. HZSM-5(50) treated with NH3 has much a wider temperature tolerance, yet the upper temperature limit is only 270. One disadvantage for the selective formation of DME from methanol over zeolite is that side reactions, such as 50 30 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 Silica, wt % Fig. 6.

Temperature tolerance over different catalysts treated and untreated with ammonia. olefin formation, are autocatalytic. For example, at 280 over HZSM-5 (150), large amounts of olefins were formed. By lowering the reaction temperature to 265, olefin formation was still observed. The selectivities of DME at 265 were 100% and 80% before and after the reaction at 280. Both ammonia-treated and untreated amorphous silica-alumina have a much larger temperature tolerance; the lower limit was 250-260, and the upper limit was at least 300. Considering that syngas-to-methanol process is operat- ing at ca. 280 and that a temperature gradient along the catalyst bed is encountered in the integral reaction, amorphous silica-alumina may well be superior to HZSM-5 as a component of the hybrid catalyst in the syngas-to-DME process. Unlike HZSM-5, both \"y-Al203 and amorphous silica-alumina were reversibly poisoned by ammonia since the activity for methanol consumption gradually increased with time on stream for these catalysts. 4. Conclusions All the solid-acid catalysts in this study are active and selective for the catalytic conversion of methanol to DME. Water has a strong inhibiting effect on the activity of T-A1203, whereas the effect is less significant over H-ZSM-5 (50). Considering the activity, stability and temperature tolerance, SIRAL20 may well be superior to other solid-acid catalysts for the methanol-to-DME function in an integrated syngas-to-DME catalytic process.

The catalytic conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME) has been studied over a series of solid-acid catalysts, such as γ-Al2O3, H-ZSM-5, amorphous silica-alumina, as well as titania modified zirconia. All the catalysts are active and selective for DME formation. The apparent activation energy for DME formation over γ-Al2O3 is ca. 25 kcal/mol, a value that increases to ca. 37 kcal/mol upon the addition of 23 Torr of H2O to the reagent. The rate of methanol dehydration decreases with increasing acidity (silica content) over the amorphous silica-alumina catalysts. Although H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al = 25 is the most active among the catalysts tested, the DME selectivity is only 20% at 280°C, a typical temperature used in the syngas-to-methanol process. An amorphous silica-alumina catalyst with 20 wt.-% silica content (SIRAL20) exhibits the best catalytic performance of those tested at 280°C.
