Introduction Formaldehyde is obtained from oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol by two commercial processes: (1) on iron-molybdate-based catalysts and (2) on silver- based catalysts. In both processes, a conversion of about 99% and 92% selectivity are obtained. The temperature of reaction is about 400 in the first and about 650 in the second process. The silver process has high operating costs due to steam consumption. Investment costs are high. Silver catalysts are much more sensitive to contamination by normal methanol impurities than iron molybdate. * Corresponding author.

Castillo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) L1-L8 Iron molybdate-based catalysts get deactivated through a loss of molybdenum in a form of volatile compound. In addition, iron molybdate catalysts become less active in the presence of an excess of methanol and therefore require a relatively high oxygen partial pressure to remain active [1]. Multi-component unsupported and silica supported Mo-Ni-Co-Fe-Bi-T1-P-O catalysts [2] or catalysts contain- ing Cu, Zn, Ni, etc., have also been proposed [3]. However, the stability and catalytic performances of these catalysts make them less attractive for an industrial application. We had indicated previously [4] that a very strong synergy existed between ot- Sb204 and MoO3 in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde when these oxides are mixed together. On the other hand, extensive characterisation of this mechan- ical mixture had been made previously, indicating that no mixed oxide could form by mutual reaction and antimony did not contaminate the surface of MoO3 nor vice versa [5,6]. We present here results obtained with a catalyst prepared by mechanical mixture of oxides of molybdenum and antimony prepared separately. This catalytic system gives high catalytic performances. For example, selectivities to formaldehyde of 99.5% with a yield per pass of 93.5% were obtained. To emphasize the potenti- alities of this catalytic system and to suggest that more sophisticated preparation methods could further increase the performances of the catalyst, catalysts were also prepared by impregnation of MoO3 with antimony ions. Characterization of the catalysts by BET surface area, XRD and XPS leads us to propose an explanation of the synergy observed in mechanical mixtures. The implications of our results for the understanding of the catalytic performance and deactivation of iron molybdate catalysts and the potential application of the new proposed catalytic system are discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of pure oxides t~-Sb204 was prepared by calcination of Sb203 (p.a. UCB) in air at 500 for 20 h. MoO3 was obtained by decomposition of (NH4)6Mo7024\"4H20 (p.a. Merck) in air at 500 for 20 h. 2.2. Mechanical mixtures of MoO3 and (~-Sb2O4 The mechanical mixtures were prepared by dispersing 5 g of each oxide in 200 ml of n-pentane under vigorous agitation assisted by ultrasonic dispersion. After evaporation of n-pentane under continuous agitation at 25, the solid was dried in air at 100 overnight. The mixture was not calcined. The pure oxides used for comparison were treated exactly in the same way. R. Castillo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) L1-L8 L3 2.3. Impregnation of MoO3 with Sb ions Antimony was deposited on MoO3 by adding a solution containing antimony acetate (p.a. UCB) to 3 g of MoO3 in 30 ml of acetic acid (p.a. UCB) and 30 ml of distilled water. The amount of acetate was calculated to correspond to 1 wt % of ct- Sb204 in MOO3. The dispersion was agitated during 2 h. The solvents were evaporated at 30 under reduced pressure. The solid was dried at 100 overnight and calcined at 500 during 4 h. 2.4. Catalytic activity measurement Catalytic tests were performed in a fixed bed reactor successively at 350, 400 and 450 with the same catalyst charge. Catalysts with a granulometry between 500 and 800 ~tm were used. The composition of the reactant gas mixture was: 6.5% methanol, 19.6% oxygen and 73.9% of nitrogen. Tests were realized with pure o~-Sb204 (174 mg), pure MoO3 (174 mg) and with the mechanical mixtures (174 mg of MoO3 and 174 mg ofot-Sb204). For the impregnated catalysts the total amount of catalyst introduced in the reactor was 174 mg. The gas hourly space velocity was constant in all experiments (26220 h-1). Duration of test was 2 h at each temperature. The catalytic activity remained constant during this time. Reactants and products were analyzed by gas chromatography with a Delsi Instruments Di 200 equipment with a catharometer using a Porapak N column (1 m length and 1/8\" diameter). The chromatograph temperature was maintained at 110 for 7 min, then increased to 20 min-1 till 130 and maintained at this temperature for 3 min. The following compounds were analyzed: formaldehyde, methanol, water. 2.4.1. Synergetic effects The synergetic effects were calculated using the following expressions, taking into account the fact that ~-Sb204 is totally inert in the reaction: Synergy on the conversion C: Syn C = (CMETH--CTh)/CTh Synergy on the yield Y:=Syn Y- (YFoRM--Yxh)/YTh Synergy on the selectivity S: Syn S=-(SFoRM--Sxh)/STh in which CMETH, YFORM, and SFORM are the conversion, yield and selectivity measured with the mechanical mixture, and Ca'h, YXh, and S-rh are the respective theoretical values which are observed with pure MoO3 (when it is alone in the reactor). 2.5. Characterization XRD was performed on a Kristalloflex Siemens D5000 diffractometer using the I~ radiation of Cu (~=1.5418 A). BET specific surface areas were measured L4 R. Castillo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) LI-L8 on a Micromeritics Flowsorb II (adsorption of N2) and on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument (adsorption of krypton). XPS analyses were performed with an SSX-100 model 206 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer from Fisons with a monochromatized aluminium anode (A1K~=1486.6 eV). The surface positive charge was compensated by a \"floodgun\" operating at 6 eV using a nickel grid positioned 3 mm above the samples. The Cls, MO3d3/2, MO3d5/2, Sb3d5/2, Sb3d3/2, Ols, P2p and Cls bands were swept successively. The binding energy (BE) values were calculated using the C1s band as reference (BE of C-CH fixed at 284.8 eV). 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Catalytic activity. 3.1.1. Mechanical mixtures Results are presented in Table 1. The simple fact of adding o~-Sb204 to MoO3 produces a significant synergetic effect on conversion, yield and selectivity. Compared with pure MoO3 the selectivity of the mixture is higher at all temperatures. Synergetic effects on the selectivity are between 14.7% and 35.5%. In all cases the mixture shows a selectivity between 99 and 100%, to be compared to the values obtained with pure MoO3 (73.8%, 86.3% and 77.7%). At 350 and 400 the conversion of the mixture is lower. At 350 the yield of the mixture is lower. 3.1.2. Impregnated catalysts Results obtained at 450 are presented in Table 2. The addition of a small amount of antimony (1% of ~-8b204) on pure MoO3 gives a catalyst with a high selectivity (99.4%, compared to 77.7% obtained for pure MOO3). Conversion of impregnated MoO3 decreases by 23.2%. At 350 and 400 the selectivity also increases but the conversion and yield are lower for the impregnated catalysts.

Characterization 3.2.1. BET With pure MoO3 the surface area increases significantly after test. Fresh mixtures show surface areas nearly corresponding to the properly averaged sum of those measured for the single oxides (Table 1). Their surface area increases only slightly after test. Impregnation increases the surface area significantly (Table 2). A slight increase is observed after test. 3.2.2. XRD The XRD patterns of the fresh mechanical mixtures correspond to the super- position of those observed for the individual oxides. After test new peaks corresponding to reduced molybdenum oxide, MoO2, are observed for pure MoO3 and the mechanical mixtures. The intensity of these peaks is lower in the mixtures. For the fresh impregnated catalysts, patterns correspond to pure MOO3. After test some peaks corresponding to reduced molybdenum oxide are observed. 3.2.3. XPS Binding energies values for Mo3d3 (236.4+0.3 eV and 234.7+0.3 eV) and Mo3d5 (232.5+0.5 eV and 231.4+0.4 eV) bands observed for all catalysts can be attributed to Mo6+ and Mo4+ in MoO3 and MoO2 respectively.

On the contrary no appreciable shift is observed for the mixture after test. The proportions of the Mo6+ and Mo4+ atoms on the surface are presented in Table 3. The percentage of Mo6+ in pure MoO3 decreases after test. For the mechanical mixtures, the percentage of Mo6+ decreases only slightly after test. The binding energies for pure antimony oxide correspond to ~-Sb204 and remain unchanged after test. No other bands were observed after reaction. 4. Discussion 4.1. The catalytic activity performances A mixture of 50% of MoO3 and t~-Sb204 has a selectivity of 99.5% at 94.0% of conversion in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Expressed in yields, 93.5%. This is very close to the performance of commercial catalysts under industrial conditions. This suggests that the new system is potentially very promising. High selectivities (99.4%) have been observed also when a small amount of antimony ions corresponding to 1% of ~-Sb204 is added to MoO3 by impregnation. In this case the addition of antimony led to a decrease in the conversion. This could indicate that the increase in selectivity by adding ~-Sb204 is due to the inhibition of the non-selective sites present on MoO3 or to the fact that deposited ot-Sb204 covers a fraction of the catalytic sites. Other results, not reported here, show that, when the amount of antimony ions impregnated on MoO3 is higher (10% of ~-Sb204), the conversion also increases. This suggests that new catalytic sites are created or that ct-Sb204, when in large quantities, detaches from the surface and leaves free sites which were covered at lower a- Sb204 percentages. 4.2. Attempt to explain the observed synergetic effect Very extensive characterisation of mixtures of ot-Sb204 and MoO3 before and after catalytic tests made previously [5,6] exclude the formation of oxide phases associating Sb and Mo, as well as contamination of the pure oxides by the metallic element of the other. On the other hand, a classical bifunctional mechanism in which MoO3 and a- Sb204 would successively carry out a hypothetical 2-step dehydrogenation of methanol has never been mentioned, and is highly unlikely. It is hard (and too speculative) to imagine a semi-reacted species (e.g. semi-oxidised or semi- dehydrogenated methanol) which could desorb from one of the catalyst component and adsorb and react further on the other. The most likely explanation is that the synergy is due to the cooperation of both oxides as separate phases, thanks to a remote control mechanism via oxygen spill- R. Castillo et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) LI-L8 L7 over. Such a mechanism has been firmly established in the oxidation of olefins to unsaturated aldehydes [7,8], in the oxygen-aided dehydration of N-ethyl forma- mide to nitriles [5] and others reactions [6-8]. In all cases studied, a very complete and detailed analysis of the possible solid state reactions between molybdenum and antimony discards unequivocally the formation of \"a contaminated phase\". No experimental argument indicate that the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde could bring about phenomena or effects different from these observed in other reactions. In the present work, surface sensitive analysis, such as XPS, show only binding energies corresponding to pure MOO3, MoO2 and ot-Sb204. No significant shift in the binding energies was observed in the mechanical mixtures after test. The surface area of impregnated MoO3 increases after impregnation, confirming an effect often observed, namely that the impregnated ions detaches from the surface forming small crystallites of high specific surface area on the surface of MoO3 giving two well contacted separated phases. On the other hand, the amount of Mo4+ is higher when MoO3 works alone, compared with the amount observed in the presence of ct-Sb204. This is exactly what the remote control predicts: the presence of antimony oxide permits molybdenum oxide to reoxidize more easily, inhibiting the formation of too deeply reduced structures (non-selective edge-sharing structures) and preserves the coruer-sharing structures that are selective [7,8]. All industrial iron-molybdenum catalysts used for oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde contain a large amount of MoO3 in addition to Fez(MoO4)3. It is generally believed that the true active component in commercial catalysts is Fez(MoO4)3. Our results might lead to nuance this belief. It is not excluded that the true active component might actually be MOO3, and that Fe2(MoO4)3 could play the role of oxygen spill-over donor during the reaction as 0,-Sb204 does. On the basis of our results, we had to place Fez(MoO4)3 in the scale of donor properties on which we attempted to place various oxides frequently found in oxidation catalysts. Indeed, Fe2(MoO4)3 possesses donor properties in the presence of MoO3 [7,8], although it also exhibits some catalytic activity. It is not excluded that c~- SbzO4 be a better donor than Fe2(MoO4)3. Our catalysts are model catalysts where the two phases are intentionally made clearly distinct. There is much room for improving considerably the catalyst performances using preparation methods leading to better dispersion of the two phases and maximising the number of contacts between ~-Sb204 and MoO3 (thus making easier the flow of spill-over oxygen). The excellent selectivity obtained with MoO3 impregnated by ~-Sb204 shows that such an improvement is possible. On the other hand, the composition of the catalysts (50:50 wt. in the present paper) can certainly be optimised to obtain the best balance between production (propor- tional to surface area of ~t-Sb204) and consumption (proportional to surface area of MOO3) of spill-over oxygen, and hence, optimal activity, selectivity and perhaps life. L8 R. Castillo et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) L1-L8 5. Conclusions The two phase catalysts containing -Sb204 and MoO3 exhibit selectivities equal or surpassing those of commercial iron-molybdate based catalysts in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The reason of the conspicuous perfor- mance is attributed to spill-over oxygen flowing from ~-Sb204, otherwise inactive in the oxidation of methanol. This spill-over oxygen keeps the surface of MoO3 in a high oxidation state, thus maximising the number of active selective sites. References [1] A.R. Chauvel, Ph.R. Courty, R. Maux and CI.
