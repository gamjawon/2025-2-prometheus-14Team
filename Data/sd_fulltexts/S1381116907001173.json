These compounds were utilized as selective catalysts for acetylation of primary alcohols and aldehydes. Graphical abstract Novel N-boronomethyltrialkylammonium salts have been synthesized and utilized as catalysts for selective acetylation of primary alcohols and aldehydes. Keywords Iodomethylpinacolboronate Boronomethylammonium salts Acetylation Acylal 1 Introduction Development of novel catalysts for selective organic transformations is fundamentally an important process for organic synthesis. The catalysts that act on one particular group without affecting the remaining functional groups in a complex molecule are of paramount importance. As a part of our ongoing project involving the synthesis and evaluation of aminoboronic acids and aminoboronates as precursors for biologically important molecules, we have developed several protocols for the efficient preparation of the title compounds. The convenient access and the chemical stability of these novel aminoboronate salts prompted us to investigate the utility of these compounds for selective transformations in organic synthesis as well. B-alkylpinacolboronates are known to be stable towards air and moisture. Accordingly, we envisioned that the salts derived from halomethylpinacolboronates and tertiary amines should provide stable quaternary ammonium boronates [1,2]. We envisaged that the presence of boronate moiety and quaternary ammonium group should render mild Lewis acidity and hydrophilicity to the salts and hence they could be used as organocatalysts. 2 Results and discussion We initiated our synthesis with the preparation of iodomethylpinacolboronate 2. The reaction of B-isopropoxypinacolboronate 1 with lithiated CH2I2 at −78°C afforded 2 [3]. The boronate 2 upon treatment with Methyl amine, imidazole, and N-methylmorpholine provided the corresponding ammonium boronates 3a–c in excellent yields (Scheme 1 ). All these salts are stable white solids and can be handled in air and are freely soluble in water and dichloromethane. In order to explore the catalytic properties of these reagents, we first undertook the acetylation of alcohols. Traditionally this reaction is performed with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride in the presence of tertiary amine bases. The reaction also takes place under acidic conditions and excellent progress has been made on the Lewis acid catalyzed acetylations using variety of catalysts [4]. Acetylation of decanol, hexadecanol, and p-methoxybenzyl alcohol with acetic anhydride in the presence of the catalyst 3a took place readily to provide corresponding decylacetate 4a, hexadecyl acetate 4b and p-methoxybenzylacetate 4c in excellent yield (entries 1–3, Table 1 ). The reaction was very slow at room temperature, however heating the reaction at 50°C for 2h resulted in the facile conversion of alcohols to the acetates. The catalysts 3b and 3c derived from imidazole and N-methylmorpholine, also furnished the acetates of the primary alcohols in good yield (entries 4 and 5, Table 1). Secondary alcohols did not react under these conditions and they failed to undergo acylation even with excess acetic anhydride and prolonged heating time. When an equimolar mixture of hexadecanol 5 and 4-tetradecanol 6 was heated in the presence of catalyst 3a, and excess acetic anhydride (10 equivalents), selective formation of 1-hexadecyl acetate was observed along with the quantitative recovery of 4-tetradecanol 6 (Eq. (1)). Even secondary benzylic alcohols 7 (Eq. (2)) and tertiary alcohols 8 (Eq. (3)) did not undergo esterification under these conditions. However, highly activated secondary (allylic/benzylic) alcohol 9 obtained via the Baylis–Hillman reaction [5], underwent acylation under these conditions with the catalyst 3a (Eq. (4)). Thiols and phenols remained unreactive even in the presence of excess Ac2O and prolonged heating (entries 6 and 7, Table 1). (1) (2) (3) (4) Next, we performed the acylation of aldehydes to the corresponding acylals. They are stable and easily removable protecting groups for aldehydes [6,7]. The acylation of several aliphatic, aromatic, and aralkyl aldehydes with Ac2O in the presence of 5mol% of the above salts 3a–c proceeded satisfactorily to yield the product acylals 4a–h in good yields (entries 1–8, Table 2 ). Tetrabutylammonium bromide/iodide failed to catalyze the acylation of aldehydes, while alcohols undergo <10% acylation even with excess Ac2O and heating overnight at 50°C. The mild Lewis acidity due to the presence of boronate moiety in these salts could be mainly responsible for the product formation. 3 Conclusions In conclusion, we have synthesized novel N-boronomethyl quaternary ammonium salts and have demonstrated the application of these compounds as mild catalysts for the acylation of alcohols and aldehydes. Only primary alcohols and very active secondary alcohols undergo acylation under the reaction conditions. These catalysts are reasonably stable to air and moisture and are freely soluble in both organic and aqueous medium. The mild nature and convenient preparation of the catalysts combined with the easy availability of the chiral boronates and tertiary amines should provide facile access to various optically pure aminoboronate salts, thus further expanding the scope of these compounds for asymmetric catalysis. Further studies in this direction and other applications of these catalysts are in progress. 4 Experimental 4.1 Preparation of quaternary N-boronomethylammonium salt 3a Iodomethylpinacolboronate 2 (2.0g, 7.7mmol) was dissolved in diethyl ether (100.0mL) and triethyl amine (1.6mL, 11.5mmol) was added drop wise. The solid quaternary salt precipitated almost immediately. The solid was filtered, washed repeatedly with ether and dried in vacuo to obtain 2.6g (95%) of salt 3a. 1H NMR (CDC13, 300MHz): δ 0.78 (s, 12H), 0.88 (m, 9H), 2.96 (br s, 2H), 3.07 (m, 6H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75MHz): δ 8.7, 24.6, 53.7, 56.5, 85.5; EI-MS: 242.3 [(M−I)+, 100%]. 4.2 Preparation of quaternary N-boronomethylammonium salt 3b Procedure similar to that of 3a.

Upon completion, the reaction mixture was worked up with ether: water and purified by column chromatography to obtain the corresponding acetate. 4.5 Representative experimental procedure for the acetylation of aldehydes To a solution of aldehyde (1mmol in 1mL CH2Cl2) was added Ac2O (2mmol) and salt (3a, 0.05mmol) and heated at 50°C for 12h. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was worked up with ether: water and purified by column chromatography to obtain the corresponding acylal.
