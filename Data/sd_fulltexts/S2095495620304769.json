BIC-ESAT, and Department of Materials Science and Engineering College of Engineering Peking University Beijing 100871 China Graphical abstract A novel 3D star-like MOF derived single atom catalyst with unique Co-N3C coordination can efficiently decrease the free energy of rate determining step, which exhibits excellent ORR activity in both alkaline and acid medium. Developing high-efficiency, stable and non-precious electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly important for energy conversion and storage. Single atom catalysts (SACs) show good potential in enhancing ORR, however, the specifical control over the coordination surroundings around single metal center to intrinsically modify the electron structure is still a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that a 3D hybrid MOF composed of cobalt doped ZIF-L and ZIF-8, featuring star morphology with six equal branches, can be used as an advanced precursor for making the Co SACs for greatly boosted ORR. The as-synthesized CoSA-N-C exhibits excellent ORR activity with E 1/2 of 0.891 V in alkaline medium, outperforming the commercial Pt/C by 39 mV. Moreover, the E 1/2 of CoSA-N-C (0.790 V) is merely 15 mV, less than that of Pt/C (0.805 V) in acid medium, which is among the best in the reported state-of-the-art SACs. DFT calculations demonstrate that the enhanced ORR performance is assigned to the formation of atomically isolated cobalt atom coordinated three N atoms and one C atom, which is easier to decrease the free energy of rate determining step and accelerate the ORR process than that of traditional cobalt atom coordinated four N atoms. In addition, a primary Zn-air battery with CoSA-N-C cathode reveals a maximum power density of 92.2 mW cm−2 at 120.0 mA cm−2, far higher than that of commercial catalysts (74.2 mW cm−2 at 110.0 mA cm−2). Keywords Single atom catalysts Oxygen reduction reaction Metal-organic frameworks Zn-air battery 1 Introduction Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have become the promising candidate for future automotive applications due to their high efficiency and zero carbon emission [1–4]. However, their large-scale commercialization of PEMFCs is severely hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the prohibitive cost of noble-metal catalyst at cathode. Extensive efforts have been devoted to designing non-precious metal ORR electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and stability, such as metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon [5–8], transition metal carbides or nitrides [9–12], and transition metal coordinated complexes [13–16]. Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new alternative in heterogeneous catalysis, such as CO oxidation [17–20], CO2 reduction [21–23], water splitting [24–26], ORR [27–29] and organic synthesis [30]. Typically, the catalytically active metal sites are often coordinated by nitrogen/oxygen/carbon atoms and atomically dispersed on a solid support. Among these SACs, transition metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon (M–N–C) materials have attracted great attention owing to their good electrocatalytic activity, satisfying stability, and maneuverable scale-up production [31–34]. The MNx moieties distributed in the basal planes of carbon matrixes, resembling to the metal-macrocycle complexes, are regarded as active sites for catalyzing ORR. Compared with their bulk counterparts (nanoparticles or clusters), SACs with unique electronic structure can expose the most active sites and maximize the efficiency of atom utilization, which is beneficial to boost the specific electrocatalytic performance [35,36]. In addition, the electronic structure of single metal atom centers can be precisely tuned by altering the anchoring coordination atoms in the supporting substrates, which can further modify the corresponding electrocatalytic activities. Despite considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating carbon-based SACs via pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with enhanced ORR activities, attention has rarely been paid to tuning the coordination atom numbers and species of metal centers in single-atom materials to enhance the ORR performance. Herein, we report a new 3D star-like mixed-MOF containing Co doped ZIF-8 and ZIF-L that can be used as a new precursor for constructing single atom catalyst (CoSA-N-C) with unique Co-N3C coordination, which is different from the traditional SACs with Co-N4 coordination derived from ZIF-8 precursors. The as-synthesized Co SACs display highly efficient ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E 1/2) of 0.891 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, 39 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C (0.852 V vs. RHE). Moreover, it also exhibits the satisfying ORR activity in acid medium with E 1/2 of 0.790 V vs. RHE, merely 15 mV less than that of Pt/C (0.805 V vs. RHE), which is among the best single-atom catalysts that have been reported. First-principle calculations reveal that the Co-N3C coordination can create a new electronic state near the Fermi level to hybrid with oxygen molecule and significantly decrease the free energy of rate determining step compared with Co-N4 and Co nanoparticle, thus boosting the ORR performance. Besides, a CoSA-N-C cathode Zn–air battery displays a maximum power density of 92.2 mW cm−2 at 120.0 mA cm−2, far higher than that of commercial catalysts (74.2 mW cm−2 at 110.0 mA cm−2). Our work opens up a new routine for the controllable synthesis of efficient single atom catalysts toward energy storage and conversion. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of star-like MOF precursors In a typical procedure, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.594 g), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (10 mg) and certain amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0, 29 and 290 mg) were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water, and stirred to form a clear solution (solution A). Meantime, 2-methylimidazole (MeIM) (4.5 g) was dissolved in 80 mL deionized water and stirred to form a clear solution (solution B). Subsequently, the solution A was quickly poured into solution B, and then stirred under room temperature for 3 h, producing the pink precipitate after 10 min. The precipitate was centrifuged with distilled water and ethanol for three times, and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. ZIF-L is a two-dimensional layered Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF) consists of Zn metal ions and 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm) molecules, which are the same building blocks as ZIF-8. Unlike ZIF-8, the two neighboring two-dimensional layers in ZIF-L are bridged by hydrogen bonds instead of 2-MeIm molecules. 2.2 Preparation of Co0-N-C, CoSA-N-C and CoNP-N-C The Co0-N-C, CoSA-N-C and CoNP-N-C were prepared by the temperature-programmed procedure. The power of star-like MOF precursors was transferred into a ceramic boat and placed in a tube furnace. The sample was heated to 910 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and kept at 910 °C for 2 h under flowing argon gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer using a Cu Kα source, with a scan step of 0.02° and a scan range between 5° and 80°. The morphology of the as prepared materials was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with Philips Tecnai 20 and JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscopes. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images were collected on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin working at 200 kV. The relative energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping in the STEM were operated with a probe focused to 0.2 nm and camera length of 20 cm. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of about 2 × 10–9 Pa using Al K α X-ray as the excitation source. The atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM and Electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements were carried out from monochromatic Nion-HERME200 at 60 kV. 3 Results and discussion The synthesis process for the novel Co SACs electrocatalyst is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Firstly, a uniformly star-like hybrid MOF consists of ZIF-L and ZIF-8, which is confirmed by XRD (Fig. S1), has been fabricated as an advanced precursor. Meanwhile, partial Zn2+ sites were replaced by Co2+ through adding certain amount of cobalt nitrate. After pyrolysis at 910 °C under N2 atmosphere, the hybrid MOF was transformed into nitrogen doped porous carbon. Simultaneously, due to the uniformly dispersed Co atoms separated by Zn atoms in hybrid MOF precursor, the aggregation of Co single atoms into clusters or particles can be efficiently avoided. Owing to the lack of MeIm ligand between the layers in ZIF-L relative to that of ZIF-8, the Co single atoms derived from hybrid MOF were structured by Co-N3C instead of Co-N4. As a result, the isolated Co-N3C moieties were uniformly anchored on nitrogen doped carbon frameworks. In a similar way, a series of Co x -N-C have been prepared by changing the added cobalt amount in MOF precursors, including Co0-N-C (no cobalt), CoSA-N-C (moderate cobalt) and CoNP-N-C (excessive cobalt). The morphologies of the catalysts before and after pyrolysis were firstly studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figs. S2–S4, all the MOF precursors show the regular star shape with six equal branches, and Co atoms are successfully incorporated into the whole architecture. After the pyrolysis treatment in N2 atmosphere, the CoSA-N-C retains its initial nanostructure, while its surface becomes much rougher (Fig. 1(c)). As displayed in Fig. 1(d), some cobalt nanoparticles were obviously existed inside the carbon frameworks in CoNP-N-C. According to the TEM result (Fig. 1(e)), no cobalt nanoparticles were observed in the CoSA-N-C. Atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis was carried out to further investigate the CoSA-N-C at atomic level. Fig. 1(f) shows that Co single atoms were atomically dispersed on the porous carbon frameworks, identified by isolated bright dots marked with yellow cycles. Furthermore, the elemental mapping and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) results show that Co, C, and N are uniformly distributed throughout the entire nanostructure (Figs. 1(g) and S5). In addition, the HRTEM and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results reveal the mesoporous feature of CoSA-N-C with a large surface area of 570 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 4.37 nm, which is benefit to expose more catalytic sites for oxygen adsorption and reaction (Figs. S6 and S7). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to confirm the crystal structure of the as-prepared catalysts. As displayed in Fig. 2 (a), the CoSA-N-C shows broad and weak diffraction at around 25° and 43° in the XRD pattern, the same as that of Co0-N-C. The peaks are assigned to (002) and (101) planes of the graphitic carbon, further confirmed by Raman spectra (Fig. S8). No peaks of cobalt nanoparticles or oxides are detected in CoSA-N-C, indicating the Co species are dispersed at atomic scale. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to further investigate the surface chemical composition and state of the CoSA-N-C. The survey spectrum of CoSA-N-C indicates the presence of Co, C, N and O (Fig. S9). High-resolution N 1 s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks, corresponding to pyridinic (398.5 eV), Co-Nx (399.2 eV), pyrrolic (400.3 eV) and graphitic (401.2 eV) nitrogen species, which serve as the potential sites for anchoring cobalt atoms (Fig. 2(b)). The C 1 s spectrum shows the existence of CN and CN bonds, implying the Co-Nx moieties successfully disperse in the carbon framework (Fig. S10). In addition, the Co-C bond is also displayed in C 1 s spectrum, suggesting that the co-existence of Co-C and Co-N coordination around the single cobalt active centers. The two characteristic peaks at 796.2 and 780.7 eV are attributed to 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 peaks of Co 2p (Fig. S11), in accordance with reported Co-CxNy structure [37]. The Co content was about 2.5 wt%, confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), STEM-EDS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis (Figs. S12, S13 and Tables S1, S2). To confirm the structure of CoSA-N-C at atomic level, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were carried out. As shown in Fig. 2(c), FT-EXAFS curve for CoSA-N-C only shows a major peak at about 1.4 Å, attributed to Co–N(C) scattering path, and the Co–Co peak at about 2.2 Å was not detected. A least-squares EXAFS fitting was carried out to obtain the quantitative structural parameters of Co in the CoSA-N-C. The EXAFS fitting parameters and fitting curves were displayed in Table S3 and Fig. 2(d), respectively. The coordination number of Co was about 4, in which one Co atom was coordinated by three N atoms and one C atom. In order to exclusively identify the Co-N3C structure in CoSA-N-C, the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) is included as reference for comparison. The scattering peak for CoPc with typical Co-N4 coordination is at approximately 1.48 Å, which is larger than that of Co-N3C in CoSA-N-C. The shorter length of CoSA-N-C is probably due to the contracted structure of Co-C compared with Co-N coordination. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2(d), the atomic structure model shows the tetra-coordinated Co atom is atomically anchored in the nitrogen-doped porous carbon matrix. Unlike the most reported Co single atom catalysts derived from modified ZIF-8, CoSA-N-C exhibits a unique coordination with one C and three N atoms, instead of the common four N atoms. It is inferred that the low ligand ratio in ZIF-L in hybrid MOFs compared with pure ZIF-8 crystals leads to insufficient N coordination for CoSA-N-C. The electrochemical performance of CoSA-N-C towards ORR was evaluated in an alkaline medium with rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurement. Fig. 3 (a) shows the CV curves of a series of Co x -N-C catalysts in O2-saturated (solid line) and N2-saturated (dashed line) 0.1 M KOH. The CV curves of Co0-N-C without Co doping exhibits a much lower oxygen reduction peak than those of CoSA-N-C and CoNP-N-C, suggesting the indispensable role of Co sites in enhancing ORR activity. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the polarization curves of various samples and commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%) obtained at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves indicate the best performance of CoSA-N-C among all related catalysts, featuring a higher half-wave potential (E 1/2 = 0.891 V vs. RHE) than Co0-N-C (0.775 V vs. RHE), CoNP-N-C (0.870 V vs. RHE), and the commercial Pt/C (0.852 V vs. RHE) (Fig. S16). To gain more insight into the electron-transfer mechanism of CoSA-N-C, LSV measurements were recorded at different rotating speed (Fig. 3(d)). The K-L plots obtained from the LSV curves exhibit excellent linearity, implying the first-order reaction kinetics for ORR with a potential-independent electron transfer rate (Fig. 3(d) inset). According to the K-L equation, the electron transfer number is determined to be about 3.9, demonstrating the four-electron transfer ORR mechanism for CoSA-N-C. Moreover, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) was conducted to further investigate the ORR performance of CoSA-N-C. As shown in Fig. S17, CoSA-N-C shows a very low (<5.4%) H2O2 yields with the electron transfer number larger than 3.9, in accordance with the results of K-L plots. Moreover, CoSA-N-C exhibits excellent durability with only about 6 mV decay after 6000 cycles, attributed to the strong affinity between atomic Co sites and coordinated N atoms (Fig. 3(e)). Furthermore, CoSA-N-C also displays the promising performance in 0.1 M HClO4. As showed in Figs. S18 and S19, CoSA-N-C exhibits an obviously oxygen reduction peak at 0.72 V vs. RHE, much positive than that of Co0-N-C (0.41 V vs. RHE), indicating the important role of catalytic center for the isolated Co atoms. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the CoSA-N-C exhibits the half-wave potential of 0.790 V vs. RHE, merely 15 mV less than that of Pt/C (0.805 V vs. RHE), which is among the best ORR catalysts in acid electrolyte (Table S4). In addition, after the current–time (i-t) chronoamperometry measurements at constant potential (0.3 V vs. RHE) for 10 h, the current density only displayed ~ 12% decay, indicating the good stability of the CoSA-N-C in acid media (Fig. S21). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) test was carried out to gain a further insight into the abilities of electrons transportation of as-obtained samples. As displayed in Fig. S22, the semicircles in the Nyquist plot for CoSA-N-C is much smaller than those of Co0-N-C and CoNP-N-C, illustrating the substantially lower charge-transfer resistance of CoSA-N-C. Moreover, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was estimated on the basis of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C dl). As displayed in Fig. S23, the Co0-N-C, CoSA-N-C and CoNP-N-C exhibit similar C dl, demonstrating that the amount of exposed active sites is not the predominated reason account for the enhanced ORR activity of Co single atom catalysts. To explore the nature of the high ORR activity of CoSA-N-C, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to further investigate the role of isolated Co centers in tuning electronic structure and modifying the energy change in ORR process. According to the experimental and reported results, the isolated Co coordinated with one C and three N atoms, and Co (101) surface were adopted as the active sites of CoSA-N-C and Co particles for ORR, respectively (Fig. S24). To further clearly reveal the detailed coordination structure for CoSA-N-C, the calculation model is named as Co-N3C. As demonstrated by the density of states (DOS) of Co 3d in Co-N3C (Fig. S25), a new hybridized electronic state emerged near the Fermi level compared with Co nanoparticle. This new electronic state could be ascribed to the strong interaction between Co and the neighbor coordinated atoms (C or N atoms), which is beneficial to the orbital hybridization between the O 2p and Co 3d. The free-energy paths of Co-N3C and Co nanoparticle are shown in Fig. 4 (a and b), and the detail reaction energetics are listed in Table S5. Typically, the ORR process involves such four-electron elementary steps: (1) O2* + H+ + e− → OOH* (2) OOH* + H+ + e− → O* + H2O (3) O* + H+ + e− → OH* (4) OH* + H+ + e− → H2O* where * indicates the reactive sites and the OOH*, O*, OH* are adsorbed intermediates. As shown in Fig. 4(a), all the electron-transfer steps are exothermic for Co-N3C, leading to a downhill free energy pathway when U = 0 V. However, there is an energy barrier (0.36 eV) at third step for Co nanoparticle, indicating more external energy is needed to drive the reduction of *O to *OH in comparison to Co-N3C. Moreover, when the potential increases to 1.23 V, both the first and third electron transfer step was endothermic (Fig. 4(b)). According to the free energy of four electron transfer step, the rate determining step (RDS) was predicted to the third reduction step for both Co-N3C and Co nanoparticle, determined by the highest endothermic energy during the whole process. As a result, the free energy at RDS is 0.63 eV for Co-N3C, much lower than 1.60 eV for the Co nanoparticle, suggesting the enhanced intrinsic activity of Co single atoms compared with particles from the perspective of thermodynamics. This is considered from the reason that the orbital hybridization between the O 2p and Co 3d in Co-N3C enhances the electron-captured ability of Co center. These results demonstrate that ORR activity can be greatly boosted via downsizing the Co particles to single atoms, which was achieved by efficient reducing the activation energy barrier of RDS. Furthermore, the active sites structure for most MOF derived single atom catalysts is one metal atom coordinated by four nitrogen atoms. Thus, the free energy changes of ORR reaction process on four nitrogen coordinated cobalt (Co-N4) have also been calculated for a comparison. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the Co-N4 exhibits the similar energy change with Co-N3C, which means thermodynamic favor when U = 0 V. However, when potential was applied up to 1.23 V, the activation energy barrier for Co-N4 is 0.94 eV to drive the reduction of *OOH to *O, much larger than that of Co-N3C (Fig. 4(b)). In addition, the RDS for Co-N4 is reducing *OOH to *O instead of *O to *OH for Co-N3C, which indicates that replacing one coordinated nitrogen atom with carbon atom can alter the reaction process and reduce activation energy barrier, thus promoting the ORR performance. Motivated by the outstanding electrocatalytic performance of CoSA-N-C, the application of CoSA-N-C in advanced battery system was further assessed under real operation conditions. A home-made primary Zn-air battery was assembled with a CoSA-N-C air cathode, an alkaline electrolyte (6.0 M KOH + 0.2 M ZnCl2), and a Zn plat anode (Fig. S26). For a comparison, the performance of commercial Pt/C catalyst was also tested under the same measurement conditions. The CoSA-N-C battery achieves a specific capacity of 634.2 mAh g−1 with a gravimetric energy density of 728.4 Wh kgZn −1, higher than those of the commercial battery (specific capacity of 557.6 mAh g−1 and energy density of 622.5 Wh kgZn −1, Fig. S27). Moreover, the discharge polarization and power density curves (Fig. 4(c)) clearly shows that the CoSA-N-C cathode gives larger current density and peak power density than those commercial battery. Notably, the CoSA-N-C battery reveals a maximum power density of 92.2 mW cm−2 at 120.0 mA cm−2 far higher than those of commercial catalysts (74.2 mW cm−2 at 110.0 mA cm−2). The voltage plateaus of the CoSA-N-C at different current densities (from 5 to 30 mA cm−2) in the galvanostatic discharge process are also higher than those from the commercial counterpart (Fig. 4(d)), making it highly promising for both high-energy densities and high-power capabilities applications [38–40]. Moreover, a commercial LED device can be easily illuminated with no obvious decrease in brightness over 1 h by connecting two CoSA-N-C-based Zn–air batteries in series (Fig. S28), demonstrating a significant potential application [41–43]. 4 Conclusions In summary, a novel 3D Co based single atom catalyst (CoSA-N-C) with a unique star-like morphology and Co-N3C coordination structure has been successfully designed and fabricated. The CoSA-N-C inherits the six-equaled branches morphology of the hybrid MOF precursors, which provide abundant active sites for directly connecting to the reactants in electrolyte. Moreover, thanks to the special ratio of metal and ligand in hybrid MOF precursors, the electrochemical active Co-N3C moieties can atomically disperse in the N-doped carbon substrate. As a result, the CoSA-N-C catalyst exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity and electrochemical stability in oxygen reduction and primary Zn − air batteries. Furthermore, the DFT calculations reveals that the unique Co-N3C coordination in CoSA-N-C leads to a new electronic state to hybrid with oxygen molecule and significantly decreases the free energy barrier of rate determining step in ORR compared with four nitrogen coordinated Co (Co-N4) single atom and Co particle catalysts. Furthermore, the CoSA-N-C as cathode reveals satisfying performance in Zinc-air battery, which shows promising potential in energy storage and conversion fields.

        "dc:description": "Developing high-efficiency, stable and non-precious electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly important for energy conversion and storage. Single atom catalysts (SACs) show good potential in enhancing ORR, however, the specifical control over the coordination surroundings around single metal center to intrinsically modify the electron structure is still a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that a 3D hybrid MOF composed of cobalt doped ZIF-L and ZIF-8, featuring star morphology with six equal branches, can be used as an advanced precursor for making the Co SACs for greatly boosted ORR. The as-synthesized CoSA-N-C exhibits excellent ORR activity with E 1/2 of 0.891 V in alkaline medium, outperforming the commercial Pt/C by 39 mV. Moreover, the E 1/2 of CoSA-N-C (0.790 V) is merely 15 mV, less than that of Pt/C (0.805 V) in acid medium, which is among the best in the reported state-of-the-art SACs. DFT calculations demonstrate that the enhanced ORR performance is assigned to the formation of atomically isolated cobalt atom coordinated three N atoms and one C atom, which is easier to decrease the free energy of rate determining step and accelerate the ORR process than that of traditional cobalt atom coordinated four N atoms. In addition, a primary Zn-air battery with CoSA-N-C cathode reveals a maximum power density of 92.2 mW cm−2 at 120.0 mA cm−2, far higher than that of commercial catalysts (74.2 mW cm−2 at 110.0 mA cm−2).",
