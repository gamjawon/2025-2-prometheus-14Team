Graphical abstract Guided by the DFT calculation results, the asymmetrical nickel single atom doped with phosphorus atom was successfully fabricated by phytic acid modification and calcination treatment. The doping of phosphorus atoms in the first shell modulates the valence state of nickel centres to make them electron-rich, which leads to optimised intermediate adsorption, electron transfer, lower reaction energy barrier and finally leads to excellent ECR performance in H-type cell, flow cell and Zn-CO2 battery. Adjustment of electron distribution by heteroatom doping has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) performance of nickel single atom catalysts. Herein, density functional theory calculation (DFT) verifies that the doping of phosphorus atoms in the first shell regulates the valence state of the nickel centre and facilitates higher electron density in the outer shell, which is beneficial to intermediate adsorption, electron transfer and the decrease of reaction energy barrier, resulting in outstanding ECR performance. Guided by the theoretical calculation results, the asymmetrical nickel single atom catalyst doped with phosphorus atom was successfully fabricated by phytic acid modification and calcination treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy prove that the valence state of nickel exhibits a negative shift and makes them electron-rich after doping phosphorus atom, which is consistent with DFT results. Such catalyst displays superior ECR performance with CO faradaic efficiency above 90 % at a wide potential range and a high CO partial current density of −244.1 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V in flow cell. The asymmetric electron regulation strategy can be potentially applied to the other transition metal single atoms to enhance their catalytic performance.

Through the ECR process, the C1 products (HCOOH, CO) [3,4] and C2+ products (C2H4, C2H5OH, C2H6) [5–7] have been successfully produced. The CO pathway has relatively simple mechanism compared with other ECR pathways and is expected to be commercialised and profitable because of its high selectivity and current density and the low separation cost of CO [8]. Precious metals (Au, Ag) [9,10], and transition metal single atoms and oxides (Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) [11–14] are common catalysts for ECR to CO. Among them, Ni single atom catalysts are the mainstream materials for ECR to CO because of their remarkable performance, cost-effectiveness and high atomic utilisation [15,16]. Nickel single atom catalysts usually possess a symmetrical Ni-N4 structure, which has been demonstrated as the active site for ECR whilst concomitantly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [17,18]. However, the nickel centres have symmetric electronic distribution derived from the symmetrical coordinated structure, which is bad for CO2 adsorption and activation, thus exhibiting high kinetic overpotentials [19,20]. Therefore, the symmetric Ni-N4 structure needs to be broken and some methods have been reported including the regulation of nitrogen coordination number (unsaturated coordination) [21,22] and nitrogen types (pyrrolic N or pyridinic N) [23,24], which modulates the electron distribution at the nickel centres, facilitating the adsorption and desorption of ECR intermediates. In addition, the electron distribution can also be regulated by substituting other atoms (sulphur, phosphorus, oxygen and fluorine atoms) for nitrogen atoms owing to the differences in the electronegativity of different atoms [25–28]. Among these heteroatoms, phosphorus is an optimal doped heteroatom due to its lower electronegativity (2.19) compared to that of nitrogen (3.04) [29,30]. The lower electronegativity usually results in fewer electrons moving from nickel centre to other atoms and an electron-rich nickel centre can be achieved, which is favourable to electron transfer and intermediate adsorption, and thus enhances the ECR performance. Therefore, the electron-rich asymmetrical nickel single atoms doped with phosphorus atoms are expected to be a promising catalyst for ECR to CO. In this work, the influence of the doping position of phosphorus in nickel single atoms on the ECR process was first investigated by density functional theory calculation. This showed that the doping of phosphorus atoms in the first shell modulates the valence state of nickel centres to make them electron-rich, which leads to optimised intermediate adsorption, electron transfer, lower reaction energy barrier and finally enhanced ECR performance. Guided by the theoretical calculation results, phosphorus atoms were successfully doped into a nickel single-atom catalyst (P-Ni-NC-50) by phytic acid modification and a subsequent calcination process. Here the phytic acid not only helped maintain the morphology but also served as the phosphorus source. The prepared P-Ni-NC-50 catalyst displays a unique four-pointed star morphology with a high specific surface area and a hierarchical porous structure, offering abundant active sites and promoting the transport of CO2 and electrolyte. Experimental results indicate that the valence state of nickel behaves a negative shift and makes them electron-rich after doping phosphorus atom, which is accordance with DFT results. Such catalyst exhibits excellent ECR performance in both H-type cell and flow cell. The phosphorus atom doping strategy can be potentially expanded to the design of other high-performance transition metal single atom catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 The synthesis of precursor Firstly, the solution Ⅰ was obtained by dissolving 16 mmol of 2-methylimidazole in 40 mL deionized water. The solution Ⅱ was acquired by dissolving 2 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 22.87 mg of nickel acetylacetonate in 40 mL deionized water. Next, the above two solutions were mixed and stirred for 6 h. Lastly, the precursor was acquired via centrifugation, water washing and overnight drying at 60 °C. 2.2 The preparation of Ni-NC and phosphorus-doped Ni-NC The nickel single atom (Ni-NC) sample was prepared by calcinating the as-obtained precursor for 2 h at 900 °C under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. For phosphorus-doped Ni-NC, 300 mg precursor was added into 50 mL deionized water and 5 mL ethanol and then sonicated and stirred for 30 min (solution A). 50 µL of phytic acid was dissolved in 50 mL deionized water (solution B). Subsequently, the solution B was poured into solution A with stirring for 2 h. Thereafter, the above solution was centrifugated and the precipitate was washed with water for three times before being dried at 60 °C overnight and collected. The phosphorus-doped Ni-NC sample (P-Ni-NC-50) was prepared by calcinating the precipitate for 2 h at 900 °C under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The P-Ni-NC-100 sample was synthesised by employing the same procedure except for using 100 µL of phytic acid. 2.3 Characterisations The morphology and microstructure of the samples were observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Hitachi S-4800 and condenser aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with Themis Z (3.2). The crystal structure and composition of the samples were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 advanced powder X-ray diffractometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an ESCALAB250 XPS spectrometer. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were measured by gas adsorption with an ASAP 2460 analyser (Mac, America). The atomic structure of the samples was characterised by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy at the BL11B beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The Ni K-edge was detected in the fluorescence mode. The IFFEFIT 1.2.11 software package was used to carry out the XAFS data analysis. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements The preparation of working electrode: 5 mg sample was added into 980 µL ethanol followed by a 30 min ultrasonication. Thereafter, 20 µL Nafion solution (5 wt%) was dropped into the above solution with another 30 min of ultrasonication. Next, the evenly dispersed slurry (200 µL) was coated onto a piece of hydrophobic carbon paper (1 × 1 cm2) on a 60 °C hot plate. Lastly, the working electrode was obtained by drying at 60 °C for overnight, and the catalyst mass loading is 1 mg cm−2. H type cell measurement: The electrochemical CO2 reduction performance was firstly appraised in an air tight H-type cell with a three-electrode system, which consists of a working electrode, a counter electrode (1 × 1 cm2 Pt mesh) and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). The working electrode, reference electrode and gas dispersion tube were placed at same chamber, and the counter electrode was placed at another chamber. The two chambers were separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117 membrane). Before the test, the working electrode chamber was purged with high purity CO2 for 30 min. During the test, the CO2 gas remained in circulation with a flow rate of 12 mL min−1, and the electrolyte was CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) measurement was completed under the potential range of 0 to −1.0 V at 10 mV s−1. The chronoamperometry test was conducted at various potentials from −0.4 to −1.0 V, and the gaseous products were detected by an online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ion detector and a thermal conductivity detector. The cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted at a potential range of 0.1–0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1, which was used to obtain the electrochemical double layer capacitance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under open circuit potential with a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The Tafel slope was obtained by plotting CO partial current density against overpotential. The cycling performance was evaluated via potentiostatic testing at −0.6 V for 30 h. All potentials were calibrated with the reversible hydrogen electrode without iR compensation. Flow cell measurement: The homemade flow cell device was used to complete the flow cell measurement using a three-electrode system, which included a working electrode (0.5 cm−2 hydrophobic carbon paper with catalysts on one side), a counter electrode (nickel foam) and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode). The working and counter electrodes were separated with an anion exchange membrane. The electrolyte and CO2 gas were respectively applied to the one side of the working electrode with and without catalysts. During the test, the electrolyte (1 M KOH) was kept in circulation through a two-channel peristatic pump with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The test conditions of LSV and chronoamperometry in the flow cell are the same as those for the H-type cell. Zn-CO2 battery: The air-tight H-type cell was employed to evaluate the Zn-CO2 battery performance with a two-electrode system, which consisted of a Zn plate anode (2 × 5 cm2) and the as-prepared P-Ni-NC-50 cathode (1 mg cm−2 mass loading). The bipolar membrane was used to separate the anode and cathode. The high purity CO2 was applied to the cathode with a flow rate of 12 mL min−1, and the catholyte was CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3. The anolyte was 6 M KOH with 0.2 M Zn(CH3COO)2. The LSV tests were conducted at 1.7–3.0 V and 0–1.9 V, which were used to evaluate the charging and discharging performance, respectively. 2.5 Theoretical calculation The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was conducted at the DMol3 Package with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid of size. The NiN4/C model was created on a 4 × 4 graphene superlattice, where one nickel atom was bound to four nitrogen atoms. The 4 × 4 graphene superlattice with a nickel atom bonding with three nitrogen atoms and one phosphorus atom in the first shell was used to construct a NiN3P/C model. The construction of a NiN4-P/C model was based on a 4 × 4 graphene superlattice with nickel bonding with four nitrogen atoms in the first shell and one phosphorus atom in the second shell. The generalised gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional (PBE) formulation was employed to represent the electron exchange and correction effects. The force and energy convergence were set to be 2.0 × 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1 for structural optimisation, respectively. To avoid periodic interactions, a vacuum space along the direction normal to the catalyst surface was set to be 15 Å. The computational hydrogen electrode model was used to obtain the change in Gibbs free energies (ΔG), which can be calculated by the following equation: Δ G = Δ E + Δ Z P E - T Δ S where ΔE is total energy acquired directly from the DFT calculation, ΔZPE represents the change of zero-point energies (ZPE), T is the temperature (298.15 K), and ΔS is the entropy change between products and reactants. The ECR to CO involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons. The reaction mechanism can be described as follows: * + CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → *CO2 − + 2H+ + e− *CO2 − + 2H+ + e− → *COOH + H+ + e− *COOH + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O *CO + H2O → CO + H2O where *, *CO2 −, *COOH, and *CO stand for the simulated active site (slab) and the adsorbed intermediates, respectively. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Theoretical calculation The density functional theory calculation was firstly carried out to demonstrate the influence of phosphorus atom doping on the electronic structure of nickel centres and the reaction energy barrier of the ECR process. The electronegativity of phosphorus (2.19) is lower than that of nitrogen (3.04), so the electronic structure of nickel centres changes as the phosphorus atom is added to the Ni-N4 structure. Three models were constructed as follows: the common NiN4/C model, the NiN3P/C model with a phosphorus atom doped in the first shell of nickel, and NiN4-P/C model with a phosphorus atom doped in the second shell of nickel. Details of these models are displayed in the Supporting information (Fig. S1). It is well known that *CO2 −, *COOH and *CO are critical reaction intermediates of ECR to CO [31]. As shown in Figs. 1 a, S2 and S3, the reaction includes CO2 molecule adsorption and activation (CO2(g) + * + e− → *CO2 −), proton-coupled electron transfer process (*CO2 − + H+ → *COOH, *COOH + e− + H+ → *CO + H2O) and *CO intermediate desorption (*CO → CO(g)) [32]. As visualised in Fig. 1b, the ECR steps have lower overall free energy variation (ΔG) on NiN3P/C than those on NiN4/C and NiN4-P/C, reflecting its lowest reaction energy barrier, fastest reaction kinetics and best ECR performance. Meanwhile, the Gibbs free energy of the competitive HER process was also calculated [33]. As depicted in Fig. S4, the HER on NiN3P/C has the highest ΔG value, suggesting its superior hydrogen suppression ability. Furthermore, the effect of phosphorus doping on the charge distribution around nickel was also verified. As shown in Fig. 1c and Table S1, the nickel centre in NiN4/C has a positive charge (+0.56 e), while the nitrogen atom has a negative charge, revealing that there is an electron flow from nickel to nitrogen (Fig. S5). When a phosphorus atom was doped in the first shell, the nickel centre in NiN3P/C exhibits a less positive charge (+0.46 e) than that in NiN4/C, and the phosphorus atom has a more positive charge (+0.32 e) than the nitrogen atoms (Fig. S6), suggesting that electrons are transferred from the phosphorus atom to the nickel atom causing an electron-rich nickel atom, which is favourable for intermediate adsorption and electron transfer. The nickel centre in NiN4-P/C displays a more positive charge (+0.59 e) than that in NiN4/C (Fig. S7), indicating that the phosphorus doping in the second shell reduces the electron number of nickel centre, which is bad for the ECR reaction. As depicted in Fig. 1d, a greater charge density difference was found for NiN3P/C in the CO2 − adsorption step compared to NiN4/C, verifying the stronger CO2 − adsorption ability on the former catalyst. The projected density of states (PDOS) of the Ni 3d orbital was used to further evaluate the change of charge density. As illustrated in Fig. 1e, the d-band centre of NiN3P/C (−0.66 eV) is closer to the Fermi level than that of NiN4/C (−0.75 eV), which enhances the adsorption of reaction intermediates and facilitates electron transfer [34]. Based on the theoretical calculation results, the NiN3P/C structure with a phosphorus atom doped in the first shell and an electron-rich nickel centre reduces the reaction energy barrier and facilitates reaction kinetics, thus promoting the ECR performance. 3.2 Catalysts preparation and characterization Guided by the theoretical calculation results, the phosphorus doped nickel single atom catalyst was elaborately designed, and the synthesis route of the samples is displayed in Fig. 2 a. The P-Ni-NC-50 was prepared by a calcination process after modifying the precursor with phytic acid. For comparison, the Ni-NC specimen was obtained through the calcination of the precursor without any modifying. During the synthesis process, phytic acid was selectively adsorbed on the precursor surface through the interactions between phosphate groups and nitrogen-containing substances of precursor, forming a protective film on the surface of the precursor [35]. Subsequently, Zn was evaporated during the pyrolysis process and the formed nitrogen-doped carbon is favourable to the coordination of nickel and nitrogen [33,36]. Meanwhile, the P-O bond in phytic acid was broken and the released phosphorus atom was doped into the Ni-N structure, forming the phosphorus doped nickel single atom catalyst. As depicted in Fig. S8, the precursor exhibits the morphology of four-pointed stars with a diameter of 2.5 µm. Without the modification using phytic acid, the obtained Ni-NC shows large aggregation and does not maintain the four-pointed star morphology after the calcination process (Fig. S9). After the modification using phytic acid and the subsequent calcination process, the sample always maintains the morphology of four-pointed stars (Figs. 2b and S10), reflecting the protective role of phytic acid. The TEM images of P-Ni-NC-50 (Fig. 2c and d) also show the morphology of four-pointed stars. The high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image is displayed in Fig. 2e, which reveals plenty of isolated bright spots and no existence of nanoparticles, suggesting the formation of Ni single atoms. As illustrated in Fig. 2f, the energy-dispersive X-ray mapping proves the even distribution of C, N, Ni and P elements in P-Ni-NC-50. By contrast, the TEM image of Ni-NC (Fig. S11a and b) displays large bulks with no existence of Ni nanoparticles. The HAADF-STEM (Fig. S11c) and EDX mapping (Fig. S11d) also demonstrate the presence of Ni single atoms and the uniform distribution of C, N and Ni elements in Ni-NC. As visualised in Fig. 3 a, the XRD patterns of P-Ni-NC-50 and Ni-NC show two peaks at 26° and 44°, which are identified as the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) planes of graphite [37], suggesting the absence of crystalline Ni nanoparticles (typically >50 nm). The XPS survey spectra are shown in Fig. S12, and the C, N, and Ni element peaks exist for both Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50, while the phosphorus element peak only exists in P-Ni-NC-50, verifying the successful doping of phosphorus element into Ni-NC. The high-resolution N 1s spectra of Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50 are unravelled in Fig. 3b, where four peaks can be identified for pyridinic N (398.2 eV), metal-N (398.8 eV), pyrrolic N (399.6 eV), and graphitic N (400.9 eV) [38]. As discerned in Fig. 3c, the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of Ni-NC shows two peaks at 855.42 and 872.86 eV related to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, and verifies that the valence state of Ni in Ni-NC is between 0 and +2 [39]. For comparison, the Ni 2p spectrum of P-Ni-NC-50 shows two peaks at 855.18 and 872.55 eV, which are lower than those of Ni-NC, suggesting lower Ni valence state for P-Ni-NC-50. The P 2p spectrum of P-Ni-NC-50 in Fig. 3d can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 132.52 and 133.52 eV, which are assigned to the P-C and P-O bonds, respectively [40]. The XPS results disclose the successful doping of phosphorus and the decrease of Ni valence state after phosphorus doping, which implies an increase of electron density at the nickel centres. As depicted in Table S2, the ICP-OES results display that the nickel content of Ni-NC, P-Ni-NC-50 and P-Ni-NC-100 is 0.43 wt%, 0.39 wt%, and 0.37 wt%, respectively. The N2 adsorption and desorption curves of the samples are shown in Fig. 3e. P-Ni-NC-50 can adsorb a larger volume of N2 under low partial pressure and exhibits a stronger hysteresis curve at the relative pressure of 0.5–1.0 than Ni-NC does, revealing more micropores and mesopores compared with the other sample [41]. Accordingly, the specific surface area of P-Ni-NC-50 is 1046.7 m2 g−1, which is higher than 719.8 m2 g−1 for Ni-NC. As revealed in the pore diameter distribution plots (Fig. 3f), P-Ni-NC-50 represents higher intensity than Ni-NC especially in the range below 2 nm, suggesting more micropores existing in P-Ni-NC-50, which agrees with the results of N2 adsorption and desorption. During the high temperature pyrolysis process, the microstructure of metal–organic framework is susceptible to damage, resulting in the decrease of the surface area of Ni-NC. By contrast, the P-Ni-NC-50 maintains the porous structure and the high specific area, which further embodies the protection role of phytic acid. The high specific surface area and abundant hierarchical pores of P-Ni-NC-50 provide more active sites, which are conducive to the catalyst’s contact with electrolyte and CO2 reactant, facilitating the CO2 reduction performance. The atomic structures of P-Ni-NC-50 and Ni-NC were revealed by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Ni K-edge are displayed in Fig. 3g, and it discloses that the absorption edges of Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50 are located between Ni foil and NiO, suggesting the oxidation states of Ni are between 0 and +2 for both samples. Meanwhile, the Ni K-edge of P-Ni-NC-50 has a lower absorption energy than Ni-NC, reflecting its lower Ni valence state, which is consistent with the XPS result [42]. As displayed in Fig. 3h, the Fourier transform-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra of Ni K-edge disclose that a dominant peak at 1.41 Å exists for both Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50, which is assigned to Ni–N bond. In the meantime, Ni-Ni bond (2.18 Å) of Ni foil is not found in Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50, demonstrating the presence of Ni single atom. However, P-Ni-NC-50 also displays a shoulder peak at 1.82 Å and 2.21 Å. The difference of EXAFS spectra for P-Ni-NC-50 and Ni-NC catalyst is caused by phosphorus doping. Combined with the results of the literature [28], it is speculated that this change is owing to the formation of the Ni-P bond. Furthermore, the EXAFS fitting was used to speculate on the specific coordination structures of Ni for P-Ni-NC-50 (Figs. 3i and S13) and Ni-NC (Fig. S14). The fitting details are shown in Table S2. For P-Ni-NC-50, the Ni-N and Ni-P coordination numbers are approximately 3 and 1, indicating the presence of NiN3P coordination structure, which is consistent with the model used for DFT calculations. On the other hand, Ni-NC has the Ni-N4 coordination structure. The EXAFS wavelet transform (WT) analysis was used to further reflect the coordination information of Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-50. As corroborated in Fig. S15, the intensity maximum of P-Ni-NC-50 is related to Ni-N and Ni-P paths, which is different from that of nickel foil. 3.3 Electrochemical performance The airtight H-type cell was firstly used to appraise the electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of the samples. As illustrated in Figs. 4 a and S16, the LSV curves of Ni-NC, P-Ni-NC-50 and P-Ni-NC-100 under N2 atmosphere show lower current densities than those under CO2 atmosphere, reflecting their good ECR abilities. In addition, under CO2 atmosphere, P-Ni-NC-50 displays larger current density and lower overpotential than Ni-NC and P-Ni-NC-100, verifying its more prominent ECR performance and faster reaction kinetics. In order to investigate the ECR performances of the samples more intuitively, the CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) and CO partial current density (jCO) were tested. As displayed in Fig. 4b and c, P-Ni-NC-50 possesses the highest FECO of 94.8 % at −0.7 V and the largest jCO of −16.6 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V among the three samples. Correspondingly, Fig. 4d and e indicate that P-Ni-NC-50 exhibits lower H2 faradaic efficiency and H2 partial current density values compared to the other samples. The above results demonstrate that P-Ni-NC-50 possesses the best ECR performance and HER suppression ability, which is consistent with the DFT results. Turnover frequency (TOF) was used to assess the intrinsic activity of catalyst. The specific equation of TOF is described in Supporting information. The TOF value of Ni-NC, P-Ni-NC-50 and P-Ni-NC-100 (Fig. S17) is 2824.6, 4668.1, and 3805.0 h−1, respectively, implying the higher intrinsic catalytic activity of P-Ni-NC-50. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), Tafel slope and EIS tests were used to uncover the origin of the superior ECR performance of P-Ni-NC-50. As delivered in Figs. 4f, S18 and S19, P-Ni-NC-50 has a higher double layer capacitance (33.3 mF cm−2) than Ni-NC (27.1 mF cm−2) and P-Ni-NC-100 (33.1 mF cm−2), indicating a larger ECSA of P-Ni-NC-50, which is beneficial for creating more active sites and promotes ECR performance. Furthermore, the ECSA-normalised current density is given in Fig. S20 to exclude the influence of electrochemical active surface area. It shows P-Ni-NC-50 displays higher ECSA-normalised current density, which further reflects its superior intrinsic activity. The Tafel plots of the samples are plotted in Fig. 4g. P-Ni-NC-50 exhibits faster ECR reaction kinetics than the other samples revealed by its lower Tafel slope (230 mV dec−1) than Ni-NC (269 mV dec−1). The EIS results (Fig. 4h) can reflect the impedance information of the ECR reaction, which can be divided into three regions according to frequency including internal resistance (Rs, intercept on the X-axis), charge transfer resistance (Rct, high frequency) and Warburg impedance (W, low frequency). The fitting results verify that the P-Ni-NC-50 has lower Rs and Rct, demonstrating its fast charge transfer. The Warburg impedance at high frequency of P-Ni-NC-50 displays higher slope than Ni-NC, suggesting the lower diffusion resistance. According to the above results, the excellent ECR performance of P-Ni-NC-50 can be attributed to the large electrochemical active surface area, superior intrinsic activity and fast reaction kinetics, which may be derived from its high specific surface area, abundant hierarchical porous structure, and modulation of electronic structure. In addition, the cycling stability is one of the important indicators to evaluate performance of catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. 4i, the current density of P-Ni-NC-50 has only a slight decrease and the corresponding FECO has barely changed after cycling for 30 h at −0.6 V, reflecting its superior cycling stability. The SEM images after electrolysis are shown in Fig. S21. The P-Ni-NC-50 still keeps original four-pointed star morphology and separate existence without aggregation after electrolysis, demonstrating superior structure stability. The XPS characterization of P-Ni-NC-50 after electrolysis are depicted in Fig. S22. The bonding energies of Ni 2p3/2 for P-Ni-NC-50 hardly changes after electrolysis, verifying superior chemical stability of P-Ni-NC-50. The intermediates of ECR reaction and reaction path for P-Ni-NC-50 was elucidated through in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which was conducted at different potentials. As displayed in Fig. S23, the peaks at 1402 and 1906 cm−1 are ascribed to *COOH and absorbed linear bonded CO (*COL), respectively, which is regarded as the important reaction intermediate of ECR. The other peaks at 1224, 1510, and 2337 cm−1 are associated with the HCO3 −, CO3 2−, and adsorbed CO2, respectively. Among them, the existence of HCO3 − and CO3 2− is attributed to the use of aqueous 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte and the flux of CO2. The intensity of *COOH peak increased gradually as the applied potential further negative shift, which was corresponding to a rapid protonation of *CO2 − intermediates to generate *COOH intermediates, promoting ECR activity. Furthermore, the weak *COL peak implies that the CO can be easily desorbed from catalyst. Based on the in-situ FTIR results, the reaction pathway of P-Ni-NC-50 for ECR reaction is speculated as follows: CO2 → *CO2 − → *COOH → *CO → CO. The H-type cell measurements verified the superior ECR performance of P-Ni-NC-50 and explored the reasons for excellent ECR performance, but its current density was not sufficient for commercial applications. Therefore, the flow cell test of the sample was conducted to study the possibility of its practical applications. As discerned from Fig. 5 a, P-Ni-NC-50 can achieve a high current density of −345.0 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V, which is much higher than that in the H-type cell and close to the industrially relevant current density. The high current density with the corresponding high FECO is very important for the industrial CO production, which improves production efficiency and reduces separation cost. As visualised in Fig. 5b and c, the FECO of P-Ni-NC-50 keeps above 90 % in the flow cell with the potential range of −0.4 to −1.0 V, and the jCO of P-Ni-NC-50 reaches −244.1 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V. The large jCO of P-Ni-NC-50 and high FECO verify that the P-Ni-NC-50 is very competitive to the reported catalysts of ECR reaction (Table S4). The stability test of flow cell is conducted at −100 mA cm−2 for 9 h. As exhibited in Fig. S24, the related potential has faint change and the FECO maintains at above 93 %, demonstrating the good stability of P-Ni-N-C-50 in flow cell. The high current density and FECO of P-Ni-NC-50 in the flow cell suggest that the as-prepared P-Ni-NC-50 is a very promising ECR catalyst and is expected to achieve commercial applications. In order to study the application potential of the prepared catalyst in Zn-CO2 battery, a Zn-CO2 battery was assembled with a Zn plate as the negative electrode and the P-Ni-NC-50 / Ni-NC catalyst as the positive electrode (Fig. 5d). As shown in Fig. 5e, the P-Ni-NC-50 based Zn-CO2 battery displays good charge and discharge properties, reflecting its superior reversibility [43]. As illustrated in Fig. 5f, the P-Ni-NC-50 based Zn-CO2 battery delivers a high power density of 1.70 mW cm−2 at 1.48 mA cm−2, which surpasses the 0.70 mW cm−2 for the Ni-NC based Zn-CO2 battery. The excellent cycling stability of the P-Ni-NC-50 based Zn-CO2 battery are demonstrated by Fig. 5g where the charge and discharge curves are almost unchanged within 20 h. 4 Conclusions In this study, density functional theory calculation firstly showed that doping of phosphorus atom in the first shell modulates the valence state of nickel centres to obtain electron-rich nickel centres, which is conductive to intermediate adsorption and electron transfer, reduces reaction energy barrier and finally promotes the ECR performance. Thereafter, the asymmetrical nickel single atom catalyst doped with phosphorus atoms was successfully prepared utilising phytic acid as phosphorus resource followed by a calcination process. The phosphorus-doped sample (P-Ni-NC-50) keeps the unique four-pointed star morphology with a high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure, which provides more active sites and facilitates its contact with electrolyte and CO2 reactant. Meanwhile, the experimental results prove that the valence state of nickel has a negative shift after doping phosphorus atom, which is consistent with DFT results. The P-Ni-NC-50 catalyst displays above 90 % FECO at a wide potential range and a high jCO of −244.1 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V is achieved. The Zn-CO2 battery assembled with the P-Ni-NC-50 cathode and the Zn plate anode delivers a high power density of 1.70 mW cm−2 at 1.48 mA cm−2. This work proves that phosphorus atom doping strategy is useful for asymmetric coordination regulation of Ni-based catalysts for ECR, which could also be expanded to the design of other transition metal single atom catalysts to improve their catalytic performance.

        "dc:description": "Adjustment of electron distribution by heteroatom doping has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) performance of nickel single atom catalysts. Herein, density functional theory calculation (DFT) verifies that the doping of phosphorus atoms in the first shell regulates the valence state of the nickel centre and facilitates higher electron density in the outer shell, which is beneficial to intermediate adsorption, electron transfer and the decrease of reaction energy barrier, resulting in outstanding ECR performance. Guided by the theoretical calculation results, the asymmetrical nickel single atom catalyst doped with phosphorus atom was successfully fabricated by phytic acid modification and calcination treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy prove that the valence state of nickel exhibits a negative shift and makes them electron-rich after doping phosphorus atom, which is consistent with DFT results. Such catalyst displays superior ECR performance with CO faradaic efficiency above 90 % at a wide potential range and a high CO partial current density of −244.1 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V in flow cell. The asymmetric electron regulation strategy can be potentially applied to the other transition metal single atoms to enhance their catalytic performance.",
