Box 124, S.221 00 Lund (Sweden) Summary A model is described of catalyst-reactant interaction. It implies that one role of the catalyst is to supply energy into that vibrational mode of the reactant that most effectively takes the system to the activated state. In this way the dissipation of energy from the excited molecule is effectively counter- acted. By treating the system as the coupled, damped oscillator of classical mechanics, an expression is derived for the isocatalytic temperature (describ- ing the 'compensation effect') in terms of the vibrational frequencies of the reactant and the catalyst system. Examples are given of the application of this model to studies on heterogeneous as well as homogeneous systems. Introduction Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis have many features in com- mon. One such feature is generally recognized, viz; the similarity between coordination and adsorption. The two processes are expected to affect the adsorbed/coordinated molecule in similar ways. This is clearly borne out, for example, by the similar trends in the molecular vibrations of metal carbonyls and of carbon monoxide adsorbed on metals [1]. An equally obvious dissimi- larity between the two classes of catalysis is the circumstance that in homogeneous catalysis the free coordination sites necessary for reaction are found on the same metal atom wheras in the heterogeneous case the free adsorption sites are usually found on neighbouring atoms. In this paper another similarity between homogeneous and heteroge- neous catalysis will be emphasized; the fact that in all cases (except some gas-phase reactions) the reaction proceeds in a condensed phase. More specifically, we will approach the problem of how the molecule can become activated in a condensed phase. It is well known that the processes of energy dissipation proceed rapidly in condensed phases [2]. One may then ask: how is it possible for a molecule to stay excited in order to react? The answer to such a question might be that in some cases this would be difficult if a catalyst was not present. The question is then transformed 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 71 into: what role has the catalyst? The present paper deals with a model on catalysis in an attempt to answer this question. The model to be described has been developed during the past few years by the present author [3-7] in relation to some earlier suggestions on resonance effects in catalysis [8,9]. It treats the catalyst as an energy reservoir ('heat bath') from which energy is supplied to the reacting system. More specifically, the model assumes that the catalyst is designed in such a way that it contains vibrators that have a vibrational frequency very closely equal to that of a vibration mode of the reactant molecule. On the other hand, this latter vibration mode must specifically be the one that corresponds to the way in which the molecule is deformed to reach the 'point of no return', i.e. the activated state. Example If the decomposition of nitrous oxide is considered, the reaction coordi- nate describing the reaction must be essentially the distance between the oxygen atom and its neighbouring nitrogen atom [7]. N=N 0 -N=N----0 > -N==N+0 The molecular vibration to be excited is then the N 0 stretching vibration. The argument is thus that a catalyst must be designed so that it can supply energy into this vibration mode at a rate that is greater than that with which the energy of excitation is lost by dissipation processes. If the frequency of the catalyst heat bath vibrator (or possibly its first overtone) is close to the frequency of the N 0 stretch, a state of resonance will enhance the rate of energy transfer and the conditions are good for a reaction to take place. The compensation effect In order to test an idea like that just mentioned, one must have quantitative data that can be used to verify or reject a proposition made from the hypothesis. In heterogeneous catalysis, such comparable, quantitative data are scarce, due to the large number of parameters that have to be controlled. One very interesting feature, however, that seems treatable is the so-called compensation effect [10]. This effect implies a linearity between In A and E, if A and E are the parameters of the Arrhenius relation for the rate constant (k) of a reaction: In & = In A - .E/RT (1) The compensation effect is usually written in the form In A = bE + c (2) 72 Equations (1) and (2) can be written as: hiA=lnZ+ /R(l/ -l/T) (3) 0 = 1/fcR (4) Equation (3) implies in turn that there exists a temperature 0 such that all the catalysts belonging to relation (2) give one and the same rate constant to the catalyzed reaction at that temperature. This result can be exemplified, for example, by the elegant results of Cremer [11,12] on the decomposition of formic acid over oxide catalysts. The Arrhenius lines cut each other in one and the same point, indicating the -2.0 -2.5 -3.0 -3.5 Fig. 1. Exemplification of how the isocatalytic temperature may be defined by the common crossing point of a set of Arrhenius lines. The data are for HCOOH dehydrogenation quoted from the work of Cremer [11]. 73 isocatalytic temperature, 0 (Fig. 1). It has been strongly pointed out by Linert [13] (see also other references in that paper) that this indication of a com- pensation effect is much more soundly based than the application of equation (2) for a series of similar catalysts. One can never be definitely sure that all the catalysts belong to one and the same group, with the same surface character- istics, etc. This has also been pointed out by Bond [14], who shows that one can obtain a set of parallel lines, giving the same but differing in reactivity per surface unit. In spite of these practical difficulties, the isocatalytic temperature is a quantity that is available and measurable to test the theory. Model In previous papers [5,15], the present author has used the analogy between the classical mechanics of a forced, damped harmonic oscillator system and the catalyst-reactant system. It may seem obsolete to use classi- cal models, but the starting point is the view that chemical reactions are first of all movements of atoms. Movements of atoms in a molecule have been quite successfully treated by various force field models to describe in- tramolecular vibrations and their energy relations [16,17]. These force field models are essentially classical physics. The application of quantum mechan- ics adds only smaller details to the results. In Fig. 2 the situation for a reacting molecule is represented schemati- cally. The vibration frequency of the catalyst system is denoted as G), that of Fig. 2. Schematic presentation of interactions between a set of vibrators with vibrating fre- quency co (representing the catalyst) and a system with vibrating frequency v (representing the reactant molecule). F is the coupling force between the vibrators and y is the damping coefficient, representing the friction-like dissipation of energy from the excited states. 74 the reacting molecule is called v and the coupling force between them is called F(t). The dissipation of energy from the excited levels is introduced as the damping coefficient, y. As shown in elementary texts [18], it is convenient to introduce the relaxation time T, denned as y = M/T, where M is the reduced mass of the system. This results in the equation of motion: d^/df2 + I/T dx/d( + v^x = F(t)IM (5) Following the notations of Kittel et al. [18], one obtains that the power absorption of the system, P, i.e. the energy transfer per unit of time, is P = P,es X (C^/T2)/^2 - ( 2)2 + CU^T2] (6) where Pyes is the power absorption at resonance, i.e. when v = w. The ratio R = PI Pig, is used as a measure of the efficiency of energy transfer from the catalyst to the reacting species. By introducing the 'quality factor', Q, denned as Q=VT we can formulate R as fi= (7) (8) One can now identify two extreme cases, that allow us to formulate expres- sions for the isocatalytic temperature of the catalytic system. By comparing the results one can then judge the relevance of the two alternatives. Alternative 1 The first alternative has been treated in a previous paper [5] and is presented below together with the corresponding deduction of an expression for the isocatalytic temperature. For a given system and conditions, there must exist a multitude of possibilities for the orientation of the reacting molecule, surface imhomogen- ities, trace element impurities, local poisoning by products, availability of crystal faces, and so on. This means a multitude of damping coefficients and similarly a multitude of quality factors. Hence, to obtain a correct presenta- tion of the total efficiency of energy transfer we have to sum all these R -terms. Hence we form the integral S= | RdQ Q-l/2 00 0= f dQ J (v2 - (u^VAuV +1 Q-l/2 (9) (10) As dx Ja^+b we obtain ^ = (l/a&) arc tg bxja + const S=v (U +7c/2 arctg V(U 2(v2 - co2), 76 (11) (12) where the + sign holds if v > co and the sign if v < (M. This relation holds for the power transfer efficiency from one vibra- tional level ra, to the next one, re,+i. Here n is a vibrational quantum number. In order for a reaction to proceed, i.e. in order for the activation process to be successful, all quantum steps must be effective. This means that both the step n = 0 > n =1 and n = 1 > n =2 and n = 2 > n =3, etc. must be efficient. As the vibrational energies differ slightly because of anharmonicity, i.e. v, 7^ v,+i, we must specify eqns. (12) for each of these values S, = v. (U 7t/2 arctg V.CO (13) The 'both-and' statement above represents a multiplication in formal logic. Hence, we want to form a function such that when multiplied for every index i the result is an addition, i.e. the fulfillment of the activation by a series of quantum jumps (cf. Fig. 3). Only an exponential expression will meet this demand. Therefore we introduce a new function, F, F = exp(S.) (14) The complete expression for the efficiency of power transfer from catalyst to molecule is thus (15) The factor Sz, describing how efficient the reaction is, will form part of the pre-exponential factor A in the conventional Arrhenius relationship (1). Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the potential curve describing the stepwise increase in vibrational energy of the reacting molecule up to the point where reaction occurs. The potential curve is that of displacement along the reaction coordinate. 76 We now define A as A=ZSz (16) where Z is a non-energy related factor, e.g. a geometrical character of importance for the reactivity. Thus lnA=lnZ+lnS^ (17) Hence, combining eqns. (1), (13), (15) and (17) we get ln^lnZ+^v.^^( ^2-arctg^^)- /Rr (18) We have now come to the point where one must leave classical mechan- ics and introduce the quantum requirement for the energy increment between the two levels ra, and ra,_n A ,=/icv, (19) This equation is written so that one can express v (and <u) directly in wavenumbers, as is also done in the rest of this paper. Introducing eqn. (19) into eqn. (18), and omitting the difference between the various v, in all cases except for the summation, we obtain In k = In Z + ^^ ( Ti/2 - arc tg g/^ )^ AJS, //ic - EfRT (20) Since we can identify the quantity NT, A , as the energy of activation for 1 mol of the reactant, we can rewrite eqn. (20) as lnft=lnZ+ /R(l/ -l/T) (3) Thus we arrive at an expression for the isocatalytic temperature, , ^.r^!. (2i) R (o , vco ^/2-arctg^_^ It is easily shown that the limiting value of for <u = v, i.e. the resonance condition, takes the simple form = N/icv/2R (22) or when v is expressed in cm\"1 and in Kelvin, = 0.715v (23) Alternative 2 We now will treat the other extreme case of energy dissipation. This is that there is one route of loss of energy that is so dominating that we can 77 neglect all others. This means that only one damping coefficient is needed and eqn. (9) reduces to S=R R= (V2 - (U2)2^2 + Ct^V2 RZ = n exp(A,) lnRz=-L(o\\2--^ In A == In Z + Ev (^-(u^^+cuV 2 VCD 1 (v2 - a2)^2 + a^2 -EIRT (24) (8) (25) (26) (27) Equation (27) can, by analogy to the treatment above, be transformed to an expression for the isocatalytic temperature, (28) This expression, as such, cannot give us information on the isocatalytic temperature unless we know the damping coefficient. Under perfect reso- nance conditions, however, when to = v one gets 0 = Nkcv/R (29) This expression is very similar to that given above for the more complex case; actually it is twice as large. For any realistic case that must be positioned between these two extremes, one must expect a value of that is between these two limits. Most probably the real situation will be more closely characterized by the tumultuous richness of events of the first case 700 800 900 1000 Fig. 4. A graphic description of the function from eqn. (21) for the value of the parameter v that corresponds to the C S stretching vibration of thiophene, i.e. v = 834 cm~1. The example is relevant for the HDS reaction [6]. One clearly observes the slow rise of the function in the region near to resonance conditions. 78 than the selected singleness of the latter. Hence we will use formulae (21) and (22) rather than (29) in the forthcoming discussion. Let us only point out here that a similar expression has been arrived at from other starting points by Linert [13]. That author, however put the emphasis on the vibration of the heat bath (the catalyst) instead of as here on the vibration of the reacting molecule. The consequence of Linert's argument would be that one specific catalyst would show the same isocatalytic temper- ature irrespective of the reactant. Furthermore, the variation of will follow, for example, a linear relation with the frequency of the catalyst system (cu). In our model, however, one will meet a much more pronounced variation of with (0, first almost negligible, then very strong (cf. Fig. 4). Case studies from heterogeneous catalysis Let us now test these ideas on some cases where the compensation effect has been observed. One such system is the hydrodesulphurisation reaction, i.e. the breaking of the C S bonds in thiophene, for example, to form hydrogen sulphide via the interaction of hydrogen. The catalyst system for this reaction is usually molybdenum sulphide on an ALOa carrier, the effect of molybdenum is often found to be increased by the addition of smaller amounts of cobalt. This system has been dealt with from the point of view of the compensa- tion effect by Bond [14] basing his work on investigations by Mitchell and Scott [19]. The relevant data are reproduced in Fig. 5 from the discussion of Fig. 5. Reproduction from ref. 6 of the In A versus E plot as given by Mitchell and Scott [19] and Bond [14], respectively. The full line is from ref. 19 and the dashed lines are from ref. 14. 79 the present author [6] on these results. The slopes of the lines represent isocatalytic temperatures of 590 K, 633 K and 544 K, respectively. The point of importance now is to decide what internal vibration of the thiophene molecule will give the best condition for a C S bond to break. To the best of the author's understanding this must be precisely that ring bond stretching that has the highest character of C S bond stretch. This appears [20] at 834cm\"1 and consequently from formula (22) one should expect an isocatalytic temperature = 596 K if perfect resonance was observed. If the frequencies of the heat bath are somewhat different, one should expect a higher value but still within an order of magnitude to that found experimen- tally. In the above-mentioned paper [6] some possible frequencies are indi- cated. For example, and only for the case of exemplification, the S H mode at 847 cm\"1 [21] might be mentioned. Another striking example from heterogenous catalysis regarding the isocatalytic temperature is the dehydrogenation of formic acid, e.g. the work of Cremer [11] on oxide catalysts and of Boudart and Iglesia [22] on metal catalysts. One observes [23] for most of the systems isocatalytic temperatures that are in the range = 640 30 K. Here the 8(0 C 0) bending mode can be regarded as the reaction-promoting vibration, giving rise to a COg molecule when the bending has gone so far that the hydrogen atom splits off. This vibration mode appears at 772 cm~1 [17] and the perfect resonance formula (22) should give = 552 K. However, as these reactions are of zero order, an extra layer of adsorbate may very well be present, supplying, inter alia, a <5(OH) vibration from adsorbed HCOOH. This appears at 950 cm~1 [24], which from eqn. (21) yields =650K. For oxide catalysts [II], the appear- ance ofM 0 vibrations around 650 cm\"! will give [23] isocatalytic tempera- tures around 700 K, also from formula (21). Case studies of homogeneous reactions Before discussing homogeneous catalysis in the context of the present model, it is necessary to point out that the formulae deduced for the energy transfer to a certain molecule must hold even if a catalyst is not present, as long as there is present some other suitable source of specific energy, a suitable heat bath. This heat bath is obviously of principal importance, and in many cases it may be constituted from a specific vibration of the solvent in which the reaction is taking place. The solvent cage around the dissolved species thus takes the place of the particle of a heterogeneous catalyst. This proposition has two corollaries: 1. Any reaction in a liquid phase might be characterized by a 'compensa- tion effect' provided a series of very nearly related reagents are compared. 2. For homogeneous catalytic reactions, the solvent may be of importance. This means that one should investigate carefully how the choice of solvent influences the reactivity of a catalytic system. 80 One such set of very nearly related reagents have been discussed by Linert [13], viz. a series of triphenylformazanes that isomerize in various fashions. In order to concentrate on essentials, we will treat only one reaction of those quoted by Linert [13] in the present paper. This reaction is depicted in Fig. 6. As Linert points out, this reaction most probably proceeds via an in-plane distortion of the phenyl group-diazo group angle. The experimental data that Linert quotes demonstrate beautifully an isocatalytic point of intersection of the Arrhenius lines. This figure is reproduced in Fig. 7. The corresponding isocatalytic temperature is 276 K. Fig. 6. The isomerisation of cis-triphenylformazanes which is treated quantitatively in Fig. 7. The substituent X is hydrogen in all cases, whereas R = H, OCHa, CH3, Cl and Br, respectively. It is this difference that causes the variation in activation energy. Fig. 7. Arrhenius plot for the isomerization of triphenylformazanes in toluene solution (cf. Fig. 6). The graph is quoted from a paper by Linert [13]. Note the similarity to the heterogeneous analogue in Fig. 1. 81 From Linert's theory, (0 = T^o = NhcoIR) this value should originate from the presence of a vibration of the solvent (toluene) at co = 193cm\"1, which is close to a band actually found in the IR spectrum, viz. 218 2 cm\"1 [13, 25]. The application of the present model to these data, however, requires a knowledge of the C N=N bending vibration frequency as this is the vibration mode that, in a very natural way, will effect the in-plane transfor- mation from the cis to the trans isomer. We have not found any spectroscopic data for precisely the compounds quoted in Linert's paper [13], but for the simpler parent compound (diphenyldiazene) Klima [26] has given some data including the frequency of the C N=N in-plane bending mode. This fre- quency is 430cm\"1 [26]. Introducing this into our eqn. (23) for perfect resonance, one gets 0 = 0.715 x 430 = 307 K. This is reasonably close to the experimental value of 276 K, bearing in mind that kinetic and spectroscopy data do not refer to exactly the same molecules. A very strong band appears at 467 cm~1 in the IR spectrum of toluene [13, 25]. This is close to the C N=N bending mode and according to eqn. (21) should give a value of = 318 K (cf. Fig. 8 where this function is recorded for v = 430 cm\"1). It thus appears that the model of the solvent as a heat bath is not unrealistic. It is therefore useful to also explore this concept for true catalytic systems, e.g. the well-known hydrogenation of olefins by rhodium(I) com- plexes (Jardine et al. [27]). Plotting In A versus the activation energy, one obtains a line with a slope that will correspond to an isocatalytic tempera- ture of about 300 K. It is believed nowadays [1] that the rate-determining step in these reactions is the reductive elimination of the M(H)R group to form M + RH. This step might be suspected to be activated by an excess energy 310 300 e /K to /cm\"^ 350 400- 450 500 Fig. 8. A graph of the relation between v and a from eqn. (21) applied to the isomerisation of the series of triphenylformazanes of Fig. 6. The value of v, i.e. 430 cm\"1, is assumed to correspond to the C N=N in-plane bending mode, which must closely relate to the reaction coordinate. 82 put into the M C C bending mode making the a-carbon atom accessible to hydrogen attack. As this vibration will not be very different from the C C C bending frequency in propane, for example, which appears at 375 cm\"1 [28], it might very well be that a suitable heat bath frequency from the solvent (benzene, in this particular case) will, by close analogy to the figures in the case treated above, yield an isocatalytic temperature of about 300 K. A heterogeneous analogue may be noted in this connection, i.e. the hydrogenation of ethyl cinnamate over a series of increasingly poisoned platinum catalysts, for which reaction a value of 0 = 340 K has been reported [29]. Final remarks The emphasis on the role of the solvent in the above examples should not obscure the possibility that a coordination catalyst can be built up that contains sufficient intrinsic vibration modes to activate a specific reaction. Examples of such complexes, rich in vibrational energy, might be the pen- tamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes that have quite different reactivity pat- terns from the non-substituted ones, or possibly the metallo-enzymes where the coordination centre has near access to vibrational energy stored in the protein structure. In this example we come, once more, close to heteroge- neous sytems of catalysis. The main argument of the present model is thus that a reaction is facilitated by a proper transfer of energy, selectively directed towards that vibration mode of the reactant where it is best needed. In the case of catalysis, the catalyst may act to supply the energy, to direct the energy in a proper manner and, in addition, to improve steric and other conditions for the outcome of the chemical reaction.

X244 89802433 0304-5102(89)80243-3 10.1016/0304-5102(89)80243-3 A model of selective energy transfer at the active site of the catalyst Ragnar Larsson Group of Catalysis Research, Inorganic Chemistry 1, Chemical Center, University of Lund, P.O. Box 124, S.221 00 LundSweden A model is described of catalyst-reactant interaction. It implies that one role of the catalyst is to supply energy into that vibrational mode of the reactant that most effectively takes the system to the activated state. In this way the dissipation of energy from the excited molecule is effectively counteracted. By treating the system as the coupled, damped oscillator of classical mechanics, an expression is derived for the isocatalytic temperature (describing the ‘compensation effect’) in terms of the vibrational frequencies of the reactant and the catalyst system. Examples are given of the application of this model to studies on heterogeneous as well as homogeneous systems. References 1 F.A. Cotton G. Wilkinson 4th Ed.
