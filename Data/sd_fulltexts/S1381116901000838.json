In situ FT-IR study on CO2 hydrogenation over SiO2-supported PtM (M = Cr, Mo, W) complex catalysts Changping Shao a * Mingshu Chen b a Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian, PR China b State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surface, University of Xiamen, Xiamen, PR China * Corresponding author. The in situ FT-IR spectra were used to study the CO2 hydrogenation reaction over the SiO2-supported heterobinuclear metal complex catalysts, PtM (M=Cr, Mo, W). The bands, which correspond to the formate species absorbed on the catalysts, were observed. During the hydrogenation reactions, the adsorbed linear and bridging CO was not observed. The experimental results suggest that for the CO2 and CO hydrogenation reaction over the same catalysts, their catalytic active intermediate species and the reaction mechanisms should be different. Keywords CO2 hydrogenation In situ FT-IR Bimetal complex catalyst 1 Introduction The hydrogenation of CO2 to valuable chemicals has received much attention in recent years. The Cu-ZnO-based catalysts are well known to be active for the methanol synthesis through the hydrogenation of CO or CO2. The Cu-formate species on surface are regarded as the intermediate of the conversion from CO2 to methanol [1,2]. However, the reaction mechanism and the active species on the Cu-based catalysts are still not clear. Until now, the supported noble bimetal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol have not been intensively studied yet. We reported the experimental results about the SiO2-supported heterobinuclear metal complex catalysts, (PPh3)HPt(μ-PPh2)(μ-CO)M(CO)4 (M=Cr, Mo, W) [3], (I). The complex catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity for methanol synthesis from CO+H2 [4] and CO2+H2 [5–7]. The present paper reports the in situ FT-IR results of the absorbed species on the PtM/SiO2 catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation reaction. 2 Experimental 2.1 The preparation of the catalysts The catalysts were prepared using the impregnation method. The complex (I) was used as the catalyst precursor. Prior impregnation, the silica was evacuated at 693K for 2h to remove physically absorbed water, and then an appropriate amount of THF solution of (I) was poured into the silica. After impregnation process was completed, the catalysts were dried under vacuum at room temperature. For comparison, a Pt/SiO2 catalyst derived from trans-Pt(H)(PPh3)2 [8] complex was prepared by the same means. 2.2 The measurement of in situ IR spectra The in situ IR spectra were measured using a stainless steel reactor cell with a CaF2 window. The catalysts were pressed into a disk (10mm diameter) and were placed in the reactor cell, which was used as a reactor. The spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 2000 spectrometer with a resolution of 2cm−1. The pressure of reactants was kept at 0.1MPa with a constant flow-rate ratio (H2/CO2=3/1). The reaction temperature was increased to a certain reaction temperature under vacuum and was kept for 15min, the reactants were passed through the reactor cell at this reaction temperature, and continued 15min, at the same time, in situ FT-IR spectra were recorded under the CO2 hydrogenation condition. 3 Results and discussion Figs. 1–4 show the in situ FT-IR spectra for the 3wt.% PtM/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at various reaction temperatures, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, on the PtCr/SiO2 catalyst, the bands attributed to the coordinated CO of original complex at 1942, 1837cm−1 (terminal CO) and at 1798, 1782cm−1 (bridging CO) decreased and even disappeared when the reaction temperature was increased from 413 to 513K. The bands at 1481 and 1436cm−1, which are attributed to the coordinated PPh3 of original complex, still remained. The bands at 2360 and 2337cm−1, which are attributed to gas-phase CO2, were too strong to cancel. At the same time, a new strong incisive band at 1583cm−1 and a new weak band at 1313cm−1 appeared. These bands could be assigned to the stretching frequency of formate species adsorbed on Pt or PtM. Similar bands were previously reported, which were ascribed to the formate species adsorbed on Cu or Rh during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, e.g. the bands at 2933, 2858, 1591 and 1353cm−1 for Cu/SiO2 [9], at 1548cm−1 for Cu/SiO2 [10], at 2956, 2882, 1560 and 1351cm−1 for Cu/TiO2 [9], at 1585cm−1 (IRAS) for Cu(Zn)/SiO2, at 1595 and 1380cm−1 for Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 [11], at 1568 and 1373cm−1 for CuO/TiO2 [12], at 1511 and 1378cm−1 for Rh-Li/SiO2 [13], etc. Recently, Bettahar et al. reported that there are three types of formate species adsorbed on Zn/Al2O3, the bands at 2882, 2774, 1595 and 1375cm−1, at 1650 and 1320cm−1, at 2895, 2767, 1590, 1390 and 1390cm−1, and a formate species adsorbed on Cu at 2925, 2847, 2692 and 1352cm−1 during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction over Cu-ZnAl2O4 catalyst [14]. Therefore, the formate species adsorbed on Pt of PtM can be regarded as an intermediate of methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The intensity of the band at 1583cm−1 increases with increase of the reaction temperature from 413 to 513K. It is reasonable taking into account that the catalytic activity increases with increased reaction temperature [5,6]. Similarly, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, on PtMo/SiO2 and PtW/SiO2, the bands, which are attributed to coordinated CO of original complexes, also decrease and even disappear when the reaction temperature is increased from 413 to 513K. At the same time, a new strong incisive band at 1583cm−1 and a weak band at 1313cm−1 appear, which can be assigned to stretching frequency of formate species adsorbed on Pt of PtMo and PtW. The intensity of the bands also increases with increase in the reaction temperature from 413 to 533K. As comparison, as shown in Fig. 4, on Pt/SiO2, during CO2 hydrogenation reaction, a new strong incisive band at 1582cm−1 appears, it could be ascribed to the formate species adsorbed on Pt, its intensity also increases with increase in the reaction temperature. The result is identical, as the Pt is active site of PtM/SiO2 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reaction. For comparing, the spectra of CO2 hydrogenation on PtM/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 at the same reaction temperature, given in Fig. 5 (at 473K) and Fig. 6 (at 513K). As shown in Fig. 5, the bands attributed to the coordinated terminal and bridging CO of original complexes obviously decrease, particularly for that of PtM/SiO2 almost disappeared, moreover the terminal CO firstly decreased and disappeared. At the same time, the strong bands at 1583cm−1 appear for four catalysts, and the weak bands at 1313cm−1 also appear. As shown in Fig. 6, the bands ascribed to the coordinated CO of original complexes all disappeared, while the intensity of bands at 1583cm−1, ascribed to the formate species adsorbed on Pt of PtM, still remained very strong and that at 1313cm−1 also remained. The results suggest that the hydrogenation reaction of formate species is not a fast step, and probably is a rate-determining step for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. These results are obviously different from the results of CO hydrogenation reaction over the same catalysts previously reported. For the spectra of the CO hydrogenation reaction, both bands of adsorbed linear CO (at 2057cm−1 for PtCr/SiO2, 2040cm−1 for PtMo/SiO2, 2060cm−1 for PtW/SiO2) and adsorbed bridged CO (at 1860cm−1 for PtCr/SiO2 and PtMo/SiO2, at 1877cm−1 for PtW/SiO2) on Pt appear at a temperature range of 463–533K [15]. However, for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, the bands attributed to the adsorbed linear and bridged CO did not appear. Very small bands at 2003cm−1 can be ascribed to the adsorbed linear CO, which is an active species for ascribed hydrogenation reaction of gas-phase CO, which is produced by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The bands attributed to the formyl species adsorbed on PtM (at 1621cm−1 for PtCr/SiO2, 1627cm−1 for PtMo/SiO2, 1600cm−1 for PtW/SiO2) during CO hydrogenation reaction are weak and broad, while the bands attributed to the formate species adsorbed on PtM (all at 1583cm−1) are strong and sharp. The results indicate that there are differences in the mechanism between CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions over the same PtM/SiO2 catalysts. The following mechanism of the hydrogenation reaction over the PtM/SiO2 catalysts is suggested. The molecules of CO2 gas are readily adsorbed by the PtM/SiO2 catalysts, and the adsorbed CO2 species on the catalytic site are rapidly converted to formate species adsorbed on Pt of PtM under reaction condition. The formate species are hydrogenated to methanol, and the process is probably a rate-determining step. Therefore, the formate species adsorbed on Pt of PtM can be regarded as a major intermediate for the methanol synthesis from the CO2 hydrogenation. The CO molecules produced in the CO2 hydrogenation should result from the reverse water gas shift reaction. 4 Conclusion In situ FT-IR was used to study the methanol synthesis reaction from the CO2 hydrogenation over PtM/SiO2 catalysts. Some special formate species with an OCO asymmetric band at 1583cm−1 were observed, which were probably bound to Pt, and were active intermediates. The comparison between the in situ FT-IR results of CO2/H2 and CO/H2 under the same reaction conditions shows that the produced surface species for the two reaction systems are essentially different. Under CO/H2 atmosphere, no adsorbed formate species can be observed. Acknowledgements The authors thank the State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surface of China for financial support.
