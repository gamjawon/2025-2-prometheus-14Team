Six novel bridge-functionalized bisimidazolium bromides have been synthesized for the catalytic cycloaddition of CO2 (70 °C, 0.4 MPa CO2). Additionally, the influence of the hydrogen-bond donors, the N-wing-tip-substituents and the chain length of the connecting carbon bridges on the catalytic activity were studied. A COOH-functionalized catalyst with mesityl N-substituents and a C3‑carbon bridge 6 (Scheme 1) proves to be slightly more active than the reference catalyst 9 ref for the addition of carbon dioxide to various epoxides, and can be analogously recycled from propylene carbonate (PC) for at least six times without distinct loss of activity. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image 1 Introduction The concentration of greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, NOx) in the atmosphere is estimated to increase significantly in the first 30 years of the 21 century [1]. This accumulation of greenhouse gases, most notably CO2, in the atmosphere is apparently affecting the global ecological balance, leading to many challenges for humankind, most notably global warming and its implications [2]. The human-made global climatic change is urging proper approaches to reduce and recycle CO2 in order to avoid accelerated environmental changes to the disadvantage of all humans. CO2 is in principle an inexpensive, nontoxic, non-flammable, abundant, and renewable C1 feedstock and has, due to its increasing abundance and the ensuing political debate attracted constant and considerable attention and efforts in both academic and industrial fields [3]. To date, CO2 has already been industrially applied to produce urea, salicylic acid, polycarbonates etc. [4] Yet the inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability hamper the extensive utilization of CO2, since the related reactions usually need high pressure and temperature or long reaction times [5]. One cost-effective and efficient strategy is the cycloaddition of CO2 with high-energy chemicals, such as epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates, being exothermic and applicable under mild conditions [6]. Cyclic carbonates are widely used as for example fuel additives, “green” aprotic polar solvents, organic intermediates, electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries or as monomers in polymerization [6]. Generally, an efficient bifunctional catalyst for the CO2/epoxide ring expansion is supposed to consist of Lewis acidic site (e.g. Al and Mg) or a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) and highly nucleophilic groups (e.g. Cl, Br and I) [7]. Quaternary ammonium salts [8], imidazolium salts [9], and quaternary phosphonium salts [10], have received much interest in this field owing to their good thermal stability, negligible vapour pressure and high tunability [11]. Introducing functional groups (e.g. hydroxyl or carboxyl groups) enhances the catalytic activity by stretching the CO bond of the epoxide and consequently facilitating the nucleophilic attack [12]. Particularly, catalysts containing a carboxylic acid moiety turn out to be more efficient benefitting from the stronger Brønsted acidity [13]. By now, some homogenous and heterogeneous bifunctional ionic liquid-based catalysts bearing HBDs have been reported [14–18]. However, these systems often need high temperatures and pressures. In 2015, an OH-functionalized imidazolium-based bifunctional organocatalyst 9 ref has been reported to provide almost quantitative yields of the corresponding cyclic carbonates under mild reaction conditions (70 °C, 0.4 MPa CO2) (Scheme 1 ) [19]. Yet, this effective bisimidazolium bromide contains two octyl N-substituents, making it harmful to the environment and being highly hygroscopic rendering it more difficult to handle [20]. This work focusses on the synthesis of new efficient bisimidazolium-based catalysts by varying the bridge-functionality (HBDs) and bridge-flexibility and N-substituents (degree of lipophilicity) in order to enhance the catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides, the environmental benignity and handling (Scheme 1). Thereby, the catalytic reaction is performed analogue to the previously reported metal- and solvent-free method under mild conditions (70 °C, 0.4 MPa CO2) [19]. Moreover, the effects of reaction parameters like temperature, time and catalyst loading, as well as the recyclability and general applicability to structurally diverse epoxides were examined for the most active catalyst. 2 Results and discussion Based on the above stated purpose and experience from former investigations on reference catalyst 9 ref , six new bisimidazolium bromides with different N-substituents and connecting carbon bridges were synthesized. The complexes have been characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and ESI-MS (for further details see the Supporting Information). All compounds are air stable solids with the exception of catalysts 5 and 7 being highly hygroscopic. The catalytic conversion of CO2 via cycloaddition with propylene oxide (PO) to cyclic carbonates was studied in analogy to the previously reported procedure of the reference catalyst 9 ref [19]. Thereby, mild reaction conditions (5 mol% catalyst loading, 70 °C, 0.4 MPa CO2, neat) were selected and all experiments were conducted in Fisher-Porter bottles. Yields and selectivity were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy with mesitylene as internal standard and are summarized in Table 1 . As summarized in Table 1, no PC (propylene carbonate) product was detected under the applied reaction conditions without a catalyst in a control experiment. The PC selectivity of all the catalysts was reached >99% with little amount of 1,3-propanediol formed. The results of catalysts 1 and 3, reveal that the PC yield drastically decreases with the shortening of the carbon bridge from C3 to C1, with 55% of catalyst 3 while catalyst 1 only leads to a conversion of 2%. One reason might be the increased solubility of 3 in PO and PC, since bisimidazolium salts with short bridges have been observed to be less soluble. Another reason can be the thermally induced decarboxylation of 1, which has been observed after treating the corresponding solutions in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide under the applied catalytic conditions (s. Figure SI10–11). Thereby, a second species appeared showing different chemical shifts with integral ratios belonging to the bridge-unfunctionalized bisimidazolium salt. By substituting the two methyl groups of 1 with isopropyl groups 2, the PC yield increases to 21%. However, also the activity of this catalyst is affected by the decarboxylation. Furthermore, prolonging the side methyl chain of 3 to a n-butyl chain 4 or even to a n-octyl chain 5, the conversion of PO increases to 85% and 92%, respectively. These results again confirm the previously reported trend of the influence of longer alkyl chains as N-wingtip substituents on the catalyst activity [13,19,20,24]. This trend is in accordance with the solubility of the catalyst in the reaction solution. Catalysts 1, 2, and 3 exhibit low solubility in the reaction mixture, while catalysts 4 and 5 remain soluble during the whole reaction process. It is expected that the polarity of the catalyst decreases with the extension of the N-substituted alkyl chain of the bisimidazolium cation and accordingly results in better solubility in the reaction mixture, but higher toxicity [25,26]. Besides, the electrostatic interaction between the anion and cation reduces following the elongation of the alkyl chain, making the anion more available for nucleophilic attack [27,28]. Surprisingly, a high PC yield of 95% is achieved with the catalyst 6 bearing mesityl as N-wingtip substituent, though 6 is not completely dissolved in the reaction solution. The PC yield of 6 is as high as that of catalyst 9 ref , despite that catalyst 9 ref is completely soluble in the reaction mixture [19]. To gain a deeper insight of the influence of the cationic structure on the catalytic effects, especially between the proton-containing groups OH and COOH, catalysts 7, 8, and 10 were synthesized and compared with 4 and 6. As postulated, both the OH and COOH groups could function as hydrogen-bond donors to activate the ring opening of epoxides and stabilize the formed oxyanion intermediate, leading to a higher catalytic reactivity [29,30]. The comparatively low PC yield of catalyst 10 (only 9%) without functional groups corroborates this hypothesis quite well when compared to the functionalized catalysts 6 and 8, of which the PC yield is 95% and 19%, respectively. Apparently, catalysts featuring COOH– groups show higher activities than the OH-functionalized catalysts in the current study. This observation has also been reported by Park et al. [13] and Han et al. [31] in exploring the addition of CO2/epoxides by ionic liquids. It is worth mentioning that the PC yield by catalyst 5 (COOH-, 92%) is slightly lower, but still in the range of the reference catalyst 9 ref (OH-, 95%) [19]. The higher catalytic efficiency of the COOH-functionalized catalyst compared to the hydroxyl functional group is related to the stronger Brønsted acidity and hydrogen-bonding donor ability of the carboxylic acid group. Moreover, the carboxylic acid moiety improves the solubility of the catalyst in the reaction mixture. OH-modified catalysts 7 and 8 as well as non-functionalized catalyst 10 are less soluble than COOH-featured catalysts 4 and 6 in the PO/PC mixture, thus owning a lower PC yield than 4 and 6, separately. Whereas, catalysts 5 and 9 ref are entirely soluble in the reaction mixture on account of the long hydrophobic n-octyl side chains. As compound 6 has no long alkyl chains, which might render these catalysts as more environmentally friendly, as usually, long alkyl side chains increase the ecotoxicity of imidazolium cations [20]. For these reasons, further investigations including optimizing the reaction conditions, recycling studies and substrate screening were performed for catalyst 6. To optimize the reaction conditions for catalyst 6, several factors such as the reaction time, temperature and catalyst loading were varied. The relationship between the reaction time and the PC yield catalysed by 6 was studied by ceasing the reaction after a certain time and taking samples NMR analysis (s. Figure SI19). As mentioned before, almost a quantitative yield of PC has been observed after 16 h. Catalyst 6 shows higher PC yields as well as higher TOFs during the first 8 h, thus being more active than 9 ref . The highest TOF achieved for 6 has been 23 h−1 compared to 9 ref with a TOF of 14 h−1. In addition, the influence of temperature on the catalytic performance of 6 was investigated by lowering the reaction temperature to 50 °C. Similar to 9 ref , the PC yield of 6 drops to 76% (after 1 h) under 50 °C, implying a temperature over 50 °C is needed to obtain a reasonable PC yield over 80% by catalyst 6. Further decrease of the temperature (to 25 °C) leads to a PC Yield of 5%, comparable to our previous investigations. The variation of the pressure to 0.2 MPA (at 70 °C) leads to a decrease to 53% and with atmospheric pressure to under 5% yield. Therefore it has been chosen not to further reduced pressure and apply 0.4 MPa as standard pressure for reactions with other substrates and catalysts. The concentration of catalyst 6 has been considered as well. A PC yield of 80% is reached with only 3 mol% catalyst loading under the same other conditions. Given that catalyst 6 can be easily separated from the reaction mixture and to keep consistent with the reported 9 ref , a catalyst loading of 5 mol% was applied in the following reactions. Apart from the catalytic activity, the recyclability and sustainability of a catalyst are also important criteria for a potential application in an environmentally friendly and economic process. To evaluate the stability and longevity of catalyst 6, the recycling experiments were performed under the regular reaction conditions as before. Catalyst 6 could be easily recycled, as the addition of diethyl ether allowed the precipitation of the catalyst and the separation from the PC avoiding distillation, which is necessary for several previously reported catalytic systems [32,33]. The PC yield remains relatively constant for six consecutive catalytic cycles without significant loss of activity, indicating a good stability of catalyst 6 (s. Figure SI20). To survey the potential and general applicability of catalyst 6, several epoxides have been applied for cycloaddition with CO2 under standard reaction conditions. As presented in Table 2 , several epoxides can be converted into the corresponding cyclic carbonates in good to excellent yields by catalyst 6, with a selectivity over 99%. A nearly full conversion occurs in the CO2/epichlorohydrin cycloaddition by catalyst 6, owing to the electron-withdrawing substituent of epichlorohydrin, which facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the bromide anion during the ring opening of the epoxide. The activity of 6 and 9 ref towards 1,2-epoxybutane are comparable, while 6 is more effective in the CO2/1,2-epoxyoctane cycloaddition with a yield of 87% versus 58% of 9 ref [19]. Also, the conversion of bulkier 1,2-epoxyoctane under catalyst 6 slightly exceeds that of 1,2-epoxybutane, which could be attributed to the longer alkyl chain of 1,2-epoxyoctane that enhances the solubility of 6. Nevertheless, no cyclic carbonate is generated in the case of CO2/cyclohexene oxide cycloaddition with catalyst 6, while a conversion of 56% was obtained with 9 ref . However, a yield of 24% is achieved with catalyst 5 containing n-octyl chains. Based on the fact that catalyst 6 is insoluble in the cyclohexene oxide reaction mixture while 5 dissolves completely in the mixture, one possible explanation might be that a long alkyl chain of the catalyst is needed to increase the catalyst solubility and activity in cyclohexene oxide. As shown here and described previously by several other groups, the presence of hydrogen-bond donors (e.g. hydroxyl group and carboxylic acid group) can accelerate the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides [34]. Catalysts bearing a carboxylic acid moiety show a better performance in the catalytic conversion of CO2 to carbonates than that with a hydroxyl group, and undisputedly, catalysts without any functional groups present the lowest activity. An analogue catalytic cycle to the reference compound 9 ref is presumed for the here reported bisimidazolium bromides including the polarization of CO bond hydrogen bond interaction of the functional groups, nucleophilic ring opening of PO by bromide and CO2 insertion (Scheme 2 ) [14,19,35]. 3 Conclusion Six novel bisimidazolium bromides have been synthesized, characterised and applied as catalysts for the formation of cyclic carbonates applying carbon dioxide and epoxides under mild conditions (70 °C, 0.4 MPa CO2) in the absence of both metals and solvents, and have been compared to literature-known compounds. The effects of the proton-containing functional groups OH and COOH, the N-substituents as well as the length of the carbon bridge were investigated and compared to the previously reported reference catalyst 9 ref . Both hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups are able to enhance the catalyst activity, while the carboxylic acid group is more effective due to the stronger Brønsted acidity and hydrogen-bond donor capability, as well as the better solubility of COOH-functionalized catalyst in PO/PC mixture. Catalysts with longer N-substituted alkyl chains show higher efficiency in the cycloaddition reaction, yet the ecotoxicity might also increase. A prolongation of the connecting carbon bridge from C1 to C3 promotes stability and activity of the catalysts. A COOH-functionalized bisimidazolium bromide 6 with mesityl N-substituents and a C3-carbon bridge presents the highest activity towards CO2/PO cycloaddition among all catalysts studied in this work and 9 ref . It shows a faster conversion and a higher TOF (up to 23 h−1). It is also efficient in the cycloaddition of various epoxides with CO2. Catalyst 6 can be easily recovered from PC by using diethyl ether, and recycled for at least six consecutive times. This study of the influence of the wing-tips, bridge and functional groups, is one step to enable a rational task-specific design for catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO2 in future. However, ecotoxicity of these compounds and a substrate-catalyst relation needs to be studied in more detail to further allow a rational design.
