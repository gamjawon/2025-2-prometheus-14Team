REACTION IN AQUEOUS SYSTEM Z. CVENGROgOVA, M. HRONEC, J. KIZLINK, L MALIK and J. ILAVSKY Department of Organic Technology, Faculty of Chemistry, Slovak Technical University, 812 37 Bratislava (Czechoslovakia) (Received August 13, 1986; accepted November 27, 1986) Summary A product study of p-xylene oxidation by the Co-Br-Py catalytic system has been investigated under anaerobic conditions at 120 C. It was shown that in bromine-free systems the direct oxidation of p-xylene by Co(III) ions proceeds, while the distribution and yield of reaction products are only slightly influenced by the type of solvent. During the simultaneous oxidation of p-xylene and p-toluic acid in aqueous systems, the latter in- creases the selectivity of reaction: however, the methyl group of p-toluic acid is not attacked by Co(III) ions. In the presence of bromine compounds, p-xylene is attacked by bromine species formed by the preferred reaction of Co(III) with bromide ions. In contrast to reaction in acetic acid, in the aqueous system brominated products are formed to a lesser extent. Introduction In our previous paper [I], we described the influence of pyridine and bromide compounds on the formation of reaction products during the Co(III)-catalyzed oxidation of p-xylene in acetic acid solvent. It has been shown that, despite the presence of p-xylene, the preferential reaction of Co(III) with Br~ produces molecular bromine, or subsequently the complex PyBr;, which brominates the hydrocarbon on the side chain and nucleus. The role of pyridine is to enhance the regeneration of Co(III) and bromide ions. When water is used instead of acetic acid solvent, a two-phase system is formed and cobalt bromide catalysts are active only in the presence of pyridine [2] or quaternary onium compounds acting as phase-transfer agents [3]. How the nature of a solvent affects the distribution of reaction products during oxidation of p-xylene in the presence of Co-Br^Py catalyst under inert atmosphere is the subject of the present study. 0304-5102/87/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 236 Experimental Materials. p-Toluic acid (PTA) was prepared by hydrolysis of methyl 4-methyl- benzoate (99.8% purity) and twice recrystallized from methanol-water solution. 4-Methylbenzyl 4-methylbenzoate was prepared by esterification of p-toluic acid with 4-methylbenzyl alcohol according to [4]. 4-Formyl benzoic acid was prepared from 4-cyanobenzoic acid by gentle oxidation with anhydrous SnCL; in HC1 [5]. 2-Bromo-4-methyl benzoic acid was prepared by bromination of p-toluic acid with Br^ in concentrated HNC>3 [6]. Other reagents were prepared and purified as described previously [1]. Procedure, apparatus and analysis were as previously reported [1]. Results The reactions of p-xylene with Co-Br-Py catalyst were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere with undiluted hydrocarbon or in the presence of water and p-toluic acid. In aqueous systems, the presence ofp-toluic acid is neces- sary to transform cobalt(III) acetate to cobalt(III) toluate, which is pre- ferentially more soluble in the hydrocarbon phase than in the aqueous phase (reaction proceeds in a two-phase system). Owing to the very low solubility of cobaltic acetate in hydrocarbon, oxidation of undiluted p-xylene proceeds under heterogeneous conditions (Table 1). A gas chromatographic analysis of reaction products indicates that in the absence of bromine compounds the auto-decomposition of cobaltic acetate is low (ca. 3 - 4% yield of C02 and CH4) and the main reaction is the side-chain oxidation of p-xylene. When molecular bromine or PyBr; complex is added to the system, the distribution of oxidation products changes but slightly, and brominated products are formed (Table 1, run 3). A change in the composition of the reaction mixture is caused by the presence of water, which decreases the formation of oxygen-containing products and increases production of 4-methylbenzyl alcohol. As is seen from Table 1, nuclear bromination ofp-xylene is only slightly dependent on the reaction temperature and presence of Co(III) acetate, water or pyridine. However, pyridine strongly suppresses the formation of 4-methylbenzyl bromide. If the amount of water added to p-xylene is higher than 3%, a two- phase system is formed. To enhance the oxidation, p-toluic acid is used to transform Co(III) acetate probably to Co(III) toluate, which is already soluble in p-xylene at reaction temperature. However, Co(III) salts of car- boxy lie acids at elevated temperatures (>100 C) are unstable and auto- decompose [7]. Thus, as we have observed, the reaction of Co(III) acetate with p-toluic acid at 120 C in aqueous solution in the absence of p-xylene under nitrogen atmosphere is characterized by very low selectivity. Although the conversion of Co(III) is more than 60%, the yield of the main side-chain 0 \"xi TO y <o M if w iooOCTgoo>g g g 00.-<C;50oi5 B B oooo-isdd-K I ^ I -S \" ^ > ^ fl* Efitpoi-^tn la to \"t-- ogoooogogo q Sjoooo a o so oooJ3oooo-i3oJ3o -s> <u <iT T3 0 ;_ e. ^ S S s- 1?

During the reaction methane is formed in only trace amounts, but the production of CO; is about 0.07 - 0.11 mol per mol of reduced Co(III). Addition of pyridine or bromine compounds (Br;, PyBr;, HBr) to aqueous solutions of p-toluic acid and Co(III) acetate virtually does not influence the yield of oxygen-containing reaction products, but does increase the conversion of Co(III). Brominated products, preferably nuclear bromi- nated p-toluic acid, are formed in about 11 -14% yield calculated on the p- toluic acid used. However, their amount is practically independent of the presence of Co(III), pyridine or temperature in the range 20 - 120 C. The addition of p-xylene to aqueous solutions of Co(III) acetate and p-toluic acid decreases the yield of CO; and, as shown in Table 2, increases the selectivity of reaction, i.e., the yield of oxygen-containing products. An interesting observation is that under these conditions, the methyl group of p-toluic acid is practically not attacked, and only p-xylene participates in the reaction. The main reaction products are the same as in undiluted p- xylene, however, their distribution is different. An exception is 4-methyl- benzyl 4-methylbenzoate, which is produced by esterification of 4-methyl- benzyl alcohol with p-toluic acid or, as will be discussed below, it can be formed from an intermediate carbocation. Addition of bromine compounds to this system usually decreases the overall yield of oxygen-containing compounds, while bromination of p-xylene and partly of p-toluic acid proceed. Distribution of side-chain and nuclear brominated products is influenced by the presence of cobaltic acetate and by reaction temperature. When water or pyridine are absent, an extremely high degree of nuclear bromination of p-xylene in the presence of molecular bromine or PyBr; complex is observed (Table 2, runs 8 and 12). Under these conditions, 4-methylbenzyl bromide is not formed in detectable amounts. Discussion The results of the oxidation of p-xylene by Co-Br^Py catalyst in undiluted p-xylene and in the presence of an aqueous solution of p-toluic acid show that distribution and yield of reaction products are similar to those observed in acetic acid [1]. These findings suggest that in the men- tioned systems, oxidation is governed by the same mechanism. Thus, in bromine-free systems the direct oxidation of p-xylene by Co(III) ions was suggested to account for the formation of reaction products [8]. ArCHa + Co(III) <=t ArCHa4\" + Co(II) (1) ArCH3+ > ArCH;\" + H4^ (2) ArCH/ + Co(III) > ArCH^ + H+ (3) 240 ArCHa\"1\" + AcCT > ArCHzOAc (4) If the reaction proceeds in the system composed of a mixture of p-xylene and p-toluic acid, then 4-methylbenzyl 4-methylbenzoate is also produced. This ester can be formed by the reaction of intermediate carbocation with the 4-methylbenzoate anion: AxCH^ + CHaCeK^COO- > ArCHzOOCCeHsCHa (5) and obviously by esterification of produced 4-methylbenzyl alcohol. An interesting feature of simultaneous oxidation of p-xylene and p-toluic acid in aqueous system in the absence of bromine compounds is that the methyl group of p-toluic acid is virtually not attacked by Co(III) ions. This supports our earlier suggestion that in the commercial oxidation of p-xylene operating in aqueous systems, p-toluic acid is not oxidized to terephthalic acid directly by Co (III) ions, but rather by cooxidation with radicals derived from hydrocarbon [9]. Since the presence ofp-toluic acid increases the selectivity of the reaction, whereas in its absence resistance is shown against attack by Co(III) ions, it indicates that probably through the formation of Co(III) toluates, p-toluic acid facilitates the transport of Co(III) ions to the hydrocarbon phase and so retards the auto-decomposition of cobaltic acetate. If a mixture of p-xylene and p-toluic acid contains also bromide com- pounds, reaction steps 1 and 2 involving the direct attack of hydrocarbon by Co(III) ion are not significant. In this case, methyl groups ofp-xylene are attacked by bromine species formed by the preferred reaction of Co(III) with bromine ions [10]. ArCHa + [Co(III)-Br-] > ArCH;' + HBr + Co(II) (6) The very low yield of 4-methylbenzyl bromide obtained in aqueous system as well as in acetic acid [1] proves that in both systems ArCH;' radicals are in the absence of oxygen converted to carbonium ions by Co(III) (reaction 3) more rapidly than they react with bromine radicals. ArCH/ + Br' \" ArCHaBr (7) 4-Methylbenzyl bromide is produced by side-chain bromination ofp-xylene by molecular bromine or PyBrz complex. The extent of this reaction is influenced by the presence of Co(III) and Co(II) acetates, which sharply decreases the yield as a result of enhancement of dehalogenation of 4- methylbenzyl bromide [1]. However, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol thus formed reacts under experimental conditions further with 4-methylbenzyl bromide, leading to di(4-methylbenzyl) ether (Table 3). ArCHpH + ArCHzBr > AxCH^OCH^Ar + HBr In the presence of Co(II) or Co(III) acetate, intermediately formed alcohol also reacts with acetate ions, producing the corresponding 4-methyl- benzyl acetate. Cobalt(III) ions attack the ether IV and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol but slightly. ca a ^ co oo co i oq oo co ^' -^i o d o d o 10 CO 00 CM '<\" ^1 CM CO ? d d d d 1 wCO ^f 01 \"IQ in CM cs 5 d d d 1 'o ^1 >0 00 CO iH E fl< ^ CM i-l 0 ^ a d d d d d 5' u 3 -0 ^i \" r-l 0d 1 1 1 d c ,9 5i S^^ a <r a C-^0 0 Kguu\"^ 0 1-'0 , , , CO r-1 1 1 1 QJ U 0 !>> <0 S 0 00 00 00 CO 0) T3 is 00 oo co co oCM CM CM CM 0)c JS S co IV ia D *^> > 1 1 101 1 1 1 d T3 S a ^ 0' 4-> ^S &) U a M CO CO CO CO 3 2 o > l-l l-I r-l r-i | T32 a. i?

Moreover, when aqueous hydrogen bromide is used as a source of bromine, lower yields of nuclear and side-chain brominated products are obtained. Because of the low yield of the brominated products, it clearly appears that in aqueous system molecular bromine or PyBr; complex is formed to a lesser extent. Therefore, bromine species produced by the favoured reaction of Co(III) with Br~ ions react with aromatic substrates preferentially to recombination. References 1 Z. Cvengrosova, M. Hronec, J.

It was shown that in bromine-free systems the direct oxidation of p-xylene by Co(III) ions proceeds, while the distribution and yield of reaction products are only slightly influenced by the type of solvent. During the simultaneous oxidation of p-xylene and p-toluic acid in aqueous systems, the latter increases the selectivity of reaction: however, the methyl group of p-toluic acid is not attacked by Co(III) ions. In the presence of bromine compounds, p-xylene is attacked by bromine species formed by the preferred reaction of Co(III) with bromide ions. In contrast to reaction in acetic acid, in the aqueous system brominated products are formed to a lesser extent.",
