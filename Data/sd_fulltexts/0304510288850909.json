C. MOL and A. ANDREINI Institute of Chemical Technology, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (The Netherlands) Introduction Commercial silica-aluminas have been used as supports for tungsten- [1] and rhenium-based catalysts [2] for the metathesis of propene. The activity of low-loading Re207/SiC>2-Al203 catalysts for propene metathesis in a flow system is much higher than that of corresponding Reit^/AlsOa catalysts [2]. With a suitable cocatalyst, e.g. a tetraalkyltin compound, supported Re207 catalysts can also cause functionalized alkenes to undergo metathesis. Results from the batch-wise metathesis of methyl oleate show that a 3 wt.% Re207/Si02'Al203 catalyst promoted with SnR4 (R = alkyi) can be as active and selective as a promoted 18 wt.% Re207/Al203 catalyst, while a promoted 3 wt.% Re207/Al203 catalyst is only marginally active [3,4]. These findings allow lower levels of rhenium in the catalyst. The use of a tetraalkyltin cocatalyst makes this catalyst of interest for practical purposes, because it not only causes the metathesis of func- tionalized alkenes, but it also enhances the catalytic activity for the metathesis of normal alkenes by ~1 - 2 orders of magnitude. The activity of silica-alumina for double bond isomerization is much higher than that of alumina, while a 3 wt.% Rc207/Si02-Al203 catalyst is even more active for double bond isomerization than the corresponding silica-alumina support [5]. This aspect is important in view of the possible application of low-loading rhenia/silica-alumina catalysts in the metathesis of (higher) alkenes. For alumina-supported metathesis catalysts, the addition of cesium can suppress side reactions, such as double bond isomerization, polymerization and coke formation [6-9]. Thus, the selectivity of a Re207/Al203 metathesis catalyst can be improved by the addition of a small amount of cesium nitrate to the catalyst [8,9]. Kawai et al. [8] attribute this effect to selective poisoning of the acid sites, depressing side reactions. The present work is part of an investigation into the behaviour of low- loading Re207/Si02'Al203 metathesis catalysts towards different substrates. Earlier, we found better results with low-rhenium-loading silica-alumina- based catalysts than with alumina-based catalysts for the gas phase metathesis of propene [2]. Because the metathesis of higher alkenes might be of practical importance, we investigated the behaviour of these catalytic 0304-5102/88/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 152 systems in such reactions. Our experience with alumina- and silica-alumina- supported rhenium-based catalysts suggested that a solution to the problem of side reactions might be found in preparing catalyst supports in which aluminium is present on the silica surface, instead of in its lattice. There- fore, we compared rhenium-containing catalysts based on commercial silica-alumina, aluminium-treated silica and 7-alumina for the metathesis of 1-octene into 7-tetradecene and ethene. Experimental Materials The aluminium-treated silicas used in this study were prepared from Davison-Grace silica (344 m2 g~1) by pore impregnation with an aqueous solution of A1(N03)3-9H20, followed by drying at 385 K. Re^O^f SiOi-AlaOa catalysts, with a calculated amount of 1 or 3 wt.% Re^O-;, were prepared either from silica-alumina type HA (Akzo; 24.3 wt.% Al^Oa, 374 m2 g~1) or from the Al-treated silicas, by pore impregnation with an aqueous solution of ammonium perrhenate (Johnson Matthey Chemicals Ltd., JMC 836 Specpure). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 385 K. The alumina-based catalysts were prepared in the same way from Ketjen 7-alumina CK-300 (190 m2 g~1). Cs-containing ReaO^/SiO^-AlsO^ catalysts were prepared by impregnating the dried catalyst with an aqueous solution of cesium nitrate and then drying at 385 K. 1-Octene (Alfa Ventron, 99%) was distilled over sodium in an argon stream. Procedures The metathesis of 1-octene was carried out in the liquid phase in a stirred glass batch reactor of about 30 cm3 capacity (Schlenk flask) at room temperature (294 K). In a typical reaction, 100 mg of the catalyst placed in a glass tube was calcined in a stream of dry oxygen at 775 K for 3 h, subse- quently activated in dry oxygen-free nitrogen at the same temperature for 2 h, and then transferred to the reaction flask under dry nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, 1 cm3 of a solution of SnEt4 (7.1 Jumol) in hexane was introduced via syringe into the reaction vessel containing a stirring bar, followed, after 5 min, by 250 fidm3 (1.6 mmol) of the substrate. The liquid phase was sampled and analyzed periodically by GC. Conversions were based on the liquid phase and calculated as: X = (22/,-C, )/(/- Cg + 2 /-,C,) X 100% (;' = 9 to 14), and the selectivity as: S = (2f^C^}/(2SfiC,) X 100% where X = conversion, iS = selectivity, C, = integrated peak area for compo- nent f, and f, = the corresponding response factor.

The conversion obtained with the 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-Al203 catalyst was higher than with the 18 wt.% Re^C^/AL^ catalyst, but the selectivity was unacceptably low and decreased with reaction time owing to ongoing isomerization reactions. Note that the end conversion is not a true thermo- dynamic equilibrium, but is determined by the experimental conditions. Figure 2 shows that the selectivity was much lower for a non-promoted 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-Al203 catalyst. If we compare the conversion to selective products for the promoted and the non-promoted catalysts, it is obvious that SnEt4 strongly enhances the rate of the selective metathesis reaction. More- over, we observed that SnEt4 depresses the catalytic activity for isomerization by a factor of at least two. This is in agreement with spectroscopic evidence indicating that SnEt4 interacts with surface OH groups [10]. Figure 3 shows the results obtained with 1-octene as substrate when the 3 wt.% Re2C>7/Si02-Al203 catalyst contains 1 or 2 wt.% Cs. The addition of cesium clearly improved the selectivity of this catalyst. The total conversion was lower, as a consequence of less side reactions. Figure 4 shows the results of the catalysts prepared from the Al-treated silicas containing 1 wt.% Re2C>7 (in this case the catalysts were tested by using 50 mg of catalyst, 3.6 Jumol of SnEt4 and 125 judm3 of substrate, all other conditions unchanged).

The activity and selectivity of the 1 wt.% ReaO^ catalyst supported on aluminium-treated silica compare well with that of the 18 wt.% Re^/Al^Oa catalyst of Fig. 1. Figure 5 compares the results from experiments with a 3 and an 18 wt.% Rc207/Al203 catalyst, respectively (these catalysts were tested by taking 50 mg of catalyst, 3.6 y.mo\\ of SnEt4 and 500 fidm3 of substrate, all other conditions unchanged). The 3 wt.% catalyst appeared to be very active when compared with the 18 wt.% catalyst. Preliminary results with SnBu4 instead of SnEt4 as cocatalyst gave com- parable results for the catalysts used. Discussion Our results indicate that the 3 wt.% ReaO^/SiOa-Al^Oa (HA) catalyst, promoted with SnEt4, gives a low selectivity in the metathesis of 1-octene, because of its high isomerization activity. This is m contrast with the high selectivity obtained with the same catalyst system in the metathesis of methyl oleate [3]. The selectivity of this catalyst system for the metathesis of 1-octene could, however, be markedly improved by adding cesium (Fig. 3). The isomerization activity of the silica-alumina (HA) support is lower than that of the corresponding 3 wt.% Re-^O-, catalyst [5]. IR studies by Xu 155 100 80 x/% or 60 S/% 40 20 0 Fig. 5.

Reaction temp. 294 K. Xiaoding et al. [11] of these catalysts show an increase in Bronsted acidity with increasing rhenium content. This suggests that the surface rhenium oxide species carries acidity of its own and/or develops a form of synergism. An OH group m the coordination sphere of Re is a probable species: HRe04 is a strong acid and Re2C>7 has a strong hygroscopic character. It is also possible that Re initiates the acidity of distinct surface OH groups. The high selectivity, i.e. low isomerization activity, of the catalysts based on Al-treated silica suggests that in these catalysts the alumina is present mostly as surface alumina, and therefore the catalyst behaved more as if 7-alumina-supported. Additional tests involving Al-treated silica-alumina as the support for a 3 wt.% Re^O-, catalyst showed a greatly improved selectivity, and indicated that the surface alumina, compared to commercial silica-alumina, has a basic character and is able to interfere with the active sites involved in isomerization. The flat trend of the selectivity as a function of the reaction time in Fig. 4, better than that of the Cs-treated catalysts in Fig. 3, indicates that the isomerization activity of these catalysts was a transient behaviour confined to the first few minutes of the reaction. It was observed that the selectivity for 1-octene metathesis of the 3 wt.% Re207/Al203 was higher than that of 1 wt.% Rei07 supported on Al-treated silicas. (It is well known from spectroscopic studies that 7-alumina carries basic functions on its surface [12]). Rhenia-silica catalysts, activated at 725 K, show no activity for 1-octene metathesis; only isomerization and dimerization occur [13]. No activity was found for metathesis with these catalysts even when a cocatalyst was used. This endorses the fact that in aluminium-containing supports, 156 aluminium has a special function in the formation of the active sites on the support surface. For the various catalyst systems studied, combinations were observed of high activity and high selectivity, and of high activity and low selectivity. On the basis of a few simple assumptions it is possible to explain these differ- ences in behaviour. The high isomerization activity of the 3 wt.% Re^0-^/ Si02-A403 (HA) catalyst in the metathesis of 1-octene can be attributed to the high surface concentration of highly acidic OH groups. Less of these groups are assumed to exist on Al-treated silicas, and this would explain the high selectivity for 1-octene metathesis of the catalysts based on these supports. The residual isomerization activity is influenced by neighbouring basic groups, but is not related to the aluminium loading: the results in Fig. 5 indicate that it is related to the rhenium loading. Under the same experimental conditions, the promoted 3 wt.% Re207/ AI203 catalyst is highly active for 1-octene metathesis (Fig. 5), but only modestly active for the metathesis of methyl oleate [3]. Apparently, a low- loading rhenium catalyst can display a quite different catalytic behaviour depending on the nature of the substrate. Furthermore, in contrast to the results with 1-octene, the 3 wt.% Re207/Si02'Al203 (HA) catalyst is more active than, and as selective as, the 18 wt.% Rc207/7-Al203 catalyst for the metathesis of methyl oleate [4]. This could mean that the Bronsted acid sites of commercial silica-alumina interact preferentially with the polar substituents of functionalized alkenes: as a result the acidity is decreased and the polar substituent is kept away from the active site. These acid sites are missing on 7-A12O3, and the polar substituent competes with the olefinic double bond for the active site. This explains the modest activity of the 3 wt.% Re207/Al203 catalyst for the metathesis of methyl oleate. When polar substituents are absent (normal alkenes, e.g. 1-octene) the latter catalyst can be fully active. Thus, the performance of these promoted catalysts depends on their acidity and on the nature of the alkene involved. References 1 A. Andreini and J. C. Mol, J. Chem.
