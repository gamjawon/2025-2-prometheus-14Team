Mamedov 1\"* Catalysis Division, Institute of lnorganic and Physical Chemistry, 29 Azizbekov Avenue, 370143 Baku, Azerbaijan Received 25 February 1994; accepted 4 May 1994 Abstract This review concerns selective oxidation catalysts which often exhibit an increase in activity or/ and selectivity as the reaction proceeds to reach its steady state. The objective is to discuss the possible reasons of this phenomenon. The evidence is presented that the activation of most of the reviewed catalysts was caused by the reaction-induced restructuring observed to occur at the surface as well as in the bulk of catalyst. Different mechanisms, such as removal of weakly bound oxygen, creation of active sites, deposition of carbonaceous material, formation of new phases or overlayers, remote controlled cooperation between separate phases and others, are discussed. These changes in catalyst composition are to be taken into account both for modelling the reaction mechanism and kinetics.

Introduction Already in 1921 Langmuir [ 1,2], in his classical papers on catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide by a platinum wire, wrote that\"...the filament was undergoing a progressive change in the direction of becoming a better catalyst... There is a good evidence that the effect is caused by changes in the structure of the surface itself, brought about by the reaction.\" He expressed intuitively a fact that nowadays has been extensively confirmed by a use of high-resolution techniques for surface studies. In the last two decades, an impressive progress has been made in studying clean metal surfaces which are shown [3-5] to undergo the chemisorption induced rearrangement on the atomic scale as well as restructuring on the mesoscopic level, leading for example to the formation of other crystal planes (facetting). According to Ertl [4], such processes either are driven by thermodynamics, namely the ten- dency to minimize the free energy, or are consequences of the nonlinear dynamics governing the behaviour of systems far from equilibrium. The latter aspects may even lead to non-uniform lateral distributions of the adsorbates (spatio-temporal self-organization), which are possibly associated with oscillatory or chaotic kinet- ics. Surface reconstructions during catalytic reactions and their catalytic consequences have recently been reviewed by Somorjai [ 5 ]. He emphasized three different changes of surface structure occurring on the time scale of chemisorption (less than 10 -6 S) and catalytic reactions (10-2-102 s) and also on longer (102- 104 s) time scales. The latter changes are usually controlled by surface atom transport and can be correlated with catalyst activation and deactivation that are detectable on a similar time scale. Oxidation and reduction of catalysts can also lead to restructuring of this type. The above-mentioned restructuring was observed during the oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and other small molecules on clean surfaces of transition metals or pure oxides frequently used in the form of monocrystals. One can expect them to take place on the surface of mixed oxides during the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Under these conditions, however, the discrimination of the type of surface reconstruction and its responsibility for the corresponding change in cata- lytic performance becomes much more complicated because of different factors. The most important of them seem to be the existence of original defects in the structure of multicomponent catalysts, the presence of several elements at the surface, each of which can serve as an adsorption site, and a variety of intermediates and reaction products able to be adsorbed. E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 The influence of reaction products along with the reagents on the steady state of the catalyst and its activity has been analyzed in a general form by Boreskov [6]. According to his concept, catalyst surface composition strongly depends on the reactive atmosphere being controlled to a large degree by the composition of the reaction mixture as well as by the reaction temperature. For oxidation catalysts, the oxygen coverage of the surface and the oxidation state of transition metals may considerably change with these variables. In this case, the rate 'constant' of catalytic reaction at constant temperature should be considered to be dependent on the composition of the reaction mixture, and the rate equation to consist of two parts [6]: W=le( C3f( ci,oi) (1) Depending both on the catalyst and on the nature of the reaction, more or less large-scale variation of R(Ci) can be observed. Consequently, it is necessary to study separately the reaction kinetics at unchanged steady state of the catalyst (the second multiplier in expression 1 ) and the change of catalyst properties under the influence of reaction mixtures having different composition (the first multiplier in expression 1 ). The former is important for understanding the mechanism of cata- lytic reaction whereas the latter may supply some information on the mechanism of catalyst action and regulation of its activity. It is worthy of note that the changes of the catalyst surface structure occurring in response to its chemical environment cannot be steps of the catalytic reaction. These are side-processes which proceed as a function of time rather slowly in comparison with the catalytic reaction. The restructuring frequently takes place not only at the surface but involves deeper layers even leading to phase transformations. During this process the catalytically active sites and phases can be created or destroyed. This is one of the mechanisms of catalyst activation or deactivation. Sintering and re-dispersion are among the phenomena that are associated with atom transport and surface restructuring. These and other origins of the deactivation phenomena are well studied and repeatedly reviewed [7-9]. Much less attention has been paid for catalyst changes which cause an increase in catalytic activity, in particular taking place during the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Boreskov [6,10] discussed in part the results of early publications on the influence of the reaction medium on activity and selectivity of some oxidation catalysts, with the emphasis mainly placed on the surface reduction and phase transformations occurring under the reaction conditions. Other mechanisms of catalyst activation as well as the results of more recent publications have not yet been reviewed. The objective of this paper is to analyze only those cases where the published works report an activation of selective oxidation catalysts under the influence of the reactive atmosphere, and to classify them according to the mechanisms of this process. The attention is focused on publications reporting data helpful for under- E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 ~ 100 t-t' 1 0 20 60 80 SURFACE REDUCTION (Yo) Fig. ].

(3) and |/0.83 (4) [13]. standing the main point of the activation phenomenon, and not on the cases in which the reaction medium produces a detrimental effect on catalyst activity. 3. Surface restructuring 3.1. Surface reduction As a rule, the surface of the steady-state catalyst differs from that of the freshly prepared one. The steady state of the catalyst in the atmosphere of a non-equilibrium reaction mixture normally corresponds to the state that is between the equilibrium states obtained during the catalyst interactions with individual reagents. Since these interactions change the catalyst composition in opposite directions, its steady state depends on the ratio of their rates. Consequently, every composition of the reaction mixture at constant temperature should comply with the corresponding steady-state composition of the catalyst. For oxidation reactions proceeding via a redox mechanism of the Mars-Van Krevelen type, it was postulated [ 11 ] that the oxygen coverage of a steady-state surface would depend on the oxygen-to-oxidizable substrate ratio in the feed stream as well as on the reaction temperature. This is evidenced by many experimental data [ 12-16]. As is seen from Fig. 1, the increase of the butene-to-oxygen ratio in the reaction mixture from 1:20 to 1:0.8 enhances by 1.5 times the extent of surface reduction of the steady-state Fe-Sb oxide catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of butene- 1. The rate of butene overall conversion decreases and the selectivity of butadiene formation increases, respectively. Another example presented in Fig. 2 concerns the Bi-Sn oxide catalyst for oxidative coupling of propene. It exhibits the evolution of catalytic activity upon E.A.

With increasing number of pulses of propene-oxygen mixture injected onto the catalyst, progressive reduction of the catalyst surface takes place, causing a drastic increase in reaction selectivity as a result of the decrease of the rate of carbon dioxide formation and slight increase of the rate of propene conversion to hexadiene-l,5. The catalyst activity and selectivity become constant after 75% of the surface oxygen has been removed. Under these conditions, the steady-state surface of Bi-Sn oxide catalyst does not retain the weakly bound oxygen having a bond energy lower than 370 kJ/mol, which is responsible for total oxidation of a hydrocarbon. Herein only the reduction of Bi 3+ to Bi 2or Bi t takes place [ 17] while the Sn 4+ cations, which have been found [ 18] to be more resistant with respect to reduction by propene, do not change their oxidation state. Similar results were obtained [ 15] for the Co-Mo oxide catalyst in oxidation of propene to acrolein. Under the studied steady-state conditions, the surface was reduced to 22% and kept only uniformly strongly bound oxygen with a bond energy of ca. 350 kJ/ mol; weaker bound oxygen had been removed from the surface during the non- steady period of catalytic reaction. Upon catalyst reduction under the reaction conditions, a diffusion of bulk oxygen to the surface may occur. According to the data reported in refs. [ 14] and [ 19], the mobility of lattice oxygen changes for a series of selective oxidation catalysts as follows: Bi-Mo > Fe-Mo > Co-Mo > Sn-Sb > Fe-Sb = Bi-Sn. There is a correspondence between the steady-state extent of catalyst reduction and the mobil- E.A.

Catalysts with little movable oxygen, such as Fe-Sb and Bi- Sn oxides, display a rather high extent of surface reduction which reach, as is shown above, 60-70%. A lower extent of surface reduction not exceeding 10% has been found [ 14] for the Fe-Mo oxide catalyst which possesses a higher mobility of the lattice oxygen. After using in the oxidative dehydrogenation of butene- 1, the bis- muth molybdate has not adsorbed any oxygen at all, thus indicating its surface to be close to fully oxidized. The high selectivity of this catalyst is due to the absence of weakly bound oxygen at the surface which contains uniform oxygen with a bond energy of ca. 340 kJ/mol [ 14]. Summarizing the data on catalyst surface reduction occurring during the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, it should be noted that this kind of reaction influence on catalyst properties improves the selectivity mainly as a result of removing of weakly bound oxygen responsible for total oxidation of the hydrocarbon, while the overall activity usually decreases or at least remains unchanged. The increase of catalyst activity under the influence of the reaction mixture is usually associated with other phenomena, one of which is a formation of additional amounts of active sites or creation of new ones. 3.2. Creation of active sites A series of publications [ 20-25 ] reported an activation effect of ammonia on the hydrocarbon oxidative conversion over oxide catalysts. For the ammoxidation reactions listed in Table 1, the increase of ammonia concentration in the reaction mixture led to an increase in the rates of both hydrocarbon overall conversion and ammoxidation, and to a decrease in the rate of total oxidation to COx. As a conse- quence, a drastic increase of the selectivity with respect to mild oxidation products was observed. Used catalysts possessed lower acidity and higher basicity in com- parison with the fresh ones. These changes in catalytic behaviour were explained [ 20,21,25 ] by a formation of new basic sites resulting from the ammonia interaction with acid sites upon adsorption at the catalyst surface. This idea is favoured by the results of adsorption experiments [ 20,21,24], according to which the preadsorbed E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 55 ammonia considerably enhanced the conversion of the hydrocarbon and oxygen mixture admitted to the catalyst by way of pulses. With the consumption of adsorbed ammonia to give the ammoxidation products, the rate of hydrocarbon overall conversion gradually decreased to the rate which corresponded to that of the same reaction carried out on the catalyst not containing the preadsorbed ammonia. It was suggested [ 21,25 ] that the functions of newly formed basic sites were performed by ammonia partially dehydrogenated species that had electron-donating properties, such as NH2 and NH. The presence of these adsorbed species of ammonia on some catalysts presented in Table 1 was confirmed by thermal desorption data [ 21,24] as well as by use of infrared spectroscopy [25,26]. With its unshared pair of electrons, the nitrogen atom is able to promote a heterolytic dissociation of the hydrocarbon C-H bond on the partly reduced surface of oxide catalyst [25] : ss: 2- s_cs2R H2 N- -CH2R H2 ~ tH2R 02-Mn]Mn~ ..... 02-Mn~E3Mn~ ..... 02-M(n-1) M(.-I) Then, by means of one electron transfer to the catalyst, both amide-ion and carbanion are transformed to the corresponding radicals capable of recombining with each other to give amine, which is further rapidly dehydrogenated to nitrile via an imine intermediate. A similar hypothesis was advanced by Haber and Wojciechowska [27] for interpreting the high selectivity of the MgF2-supported vanadium oxide catalyst in the ammoxidation of toluene. The NH 2- species were assumed to substitute for oxide ions at the surface generating active sites of the type O O II II NH-V-NH-V-NH I J 0 0 for their nucleophilic insertion into the methyl group of toluene which had been activated by abstraction of hydrogen. It was not reported, however, whether the increase of catalyst overall activity took place under the influence of the ammonia containing reaction mixture. The catalyst surface can also be activated by adsorption of the reaction products or intermediates. Boreskov et al. [28] revealed an accelerating effect of acrolein on the selective oxidation of propene over a MoO3-based multicomponent catalyst. According to their data presented in Fig. 3, the rate of propene overall conversion at 330 increased with increasing concentration of acrolein in the reaction mixture at constant partial pressures of propene and water vapour. Other products of the reaction, such as acrylic acid, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, did not influ- E.A.

Such an 'autocatalytic' effect (the authors' term) of acrolein had been associated with its electron-donating properties which could enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalyst' s oxygen ions located in the neighbour- hood of the adsorbed molecule of acrolein. The change of catalyst activity under the influence of the reaction medium was described by the expression R(Ci) =K( 1 +kl Cacr) / ( 1 + k2 Cacr) (2) which showed good agreement with the experimental data presented in Fig. 3 at K= 1.2.10 -6 l/m2s, kl = 22.5.1031/mol and k2 = 1.2.1031/mol. The creation of new catalytic sites during the selective oxidation of isobutene to methacrolein has been discussed by Weng and Deimon [ 29 ]. Based on their concept of a remote control mechanism according to which the spillover oxygen can create or modify from non-selective to selective sites and on a proportionality between the methacrolein yield and the concentration of weak BrCnsted sites on MOO3, they have suggested that the spillover oxygen emitted by a-Sb204creates the BrCnsted sites on MOO3, thus explaining the catalytic synergy between MoO3 and ot-Sb/O4 observed in this reaction. However, the exact mechanism by which the Br~nsted sites are generated by spillover oxygen as well as the role played by these sites in selective oxidation remain unknown. 3.3. Deposition of catalytically active coke For oxide catalysts of acidic nature, the activation phenomenon is frequently related to the formation of a catalytically active coke. Alkhazov and co-workers [ 30-32] showed that the activity of alumina in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, very poor at the start of reaction, gradually increased with time-on- stream, being accompanied by the deposition of carbonaceous material on the catalyst. The activity stabilized after the surface had been completely covered with the products of alkylaromatics oxidative condensation which contained fragments similar to those of polynaphthoquinone [33]. This material, once removed from the surface of steady-state alumina, displayed good catalytic activity in the oxidative E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 Table 2 Catalytic activity of carbonaceous deposit in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene at 450 and C8Hlo/ O2= 1 [32] Catalyst Yield of styrene (%) Coked A1203 (0.16 g of coke/g of catal.) 28.5 Coke removed from A1203 (0.32 g) 37.1 Soluble coke on AI203 (0.16 g/g-cat.) traces Insoluble coke on A1203 (0.14 g/g-cat.) 28.7 Insoluble coke removed from A1203 (0.32 g) 37.0 dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Based on the data presented in Table 2, the induced activity of the aluminium oxide catalyst was attributed [ 33 ] to the presence of condensation products that were insoluble in the alcohol-benzene mixture and contained more oxygen than the soluble products of the alkylaromatics condensa- tion. It was assumed that upon adsorption of ethylbenzene, hydrogen atoms of the ethyl group interacted with oxygen atoms of the carbonaceous deposit to form a hydrocarbon-oxygen complex which then decomposed producing styrene and water. The actual catalytic surface of various phosphates is also a carbonaceous over- layer common for these systems [34-36]. Their surface acidity seems to play a relevant role in the reaction through the formation of catalytically active coke. In Vrieland's model [ 34 ], the very high selectivity of the carbonaceous layer for the oxydehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is related to the moderate acid strength pro- vided by pyrophosphate groups on which the layer is deposited. Some silicates, such as ZrO2-SiO2, TiO2-SiO2 and A1203-SIO2, catalyze the ammoxidation of toluene due to the carbonaceous material deposited on the catalyst surface within the course of the reaction. These catalysts are suggested [ 37 ] to be bi-functional; toluene is oxidized on carbon surface oxides, followed by stabiliza- tion as adsorbed benzoate ion to produce benzonitrile on ZrO2, TiO2, and A1203. So, the reaction induced formation of stable surface compounds more active than the catalyst by itself appears to be an effective tool for improving catalytic behaviour of acidic oxides in selective oxidation. As shown above, interactions of the com- ponents of the reaction mixture with acid sites of medium-high strength may bring about the deposition of catalytically active coke. It contains active oxygen species, such as quinone/hydroquinone, aroxyl/phenol or carbonyl/carboxyl groups, which act as a redox system [ 38 ]. In this way, the catalyst acquires redox properties which were originally absent or insufficient. This beneficial influence of the reacting mixture on catalytic performance seems also probable for highly acidic zeolites which are now being extensively tested as catalysts for various reactions in selective oxidation. 3.4. Surface contamination One other origin of catalyst activation may be a solid state reaction between its components during catalysis, leading to surface contamination or to the formation E.A.

In this case, it is very important to make physico-chemical characterizations during catalysis (in- situ measurements) or at least after reaction, in order to detect changes which might take place in the catalyst under the reaction conditions. Weng and Delmon [29] accentuate the combined use of several techniques as well as the examination of 'artificially' contaminated systems. Using both these approaches, it was shown [39] that a considerable increase of the Sb/Te surface ratio observed for Sb204- TeOE catalysts during the oxidation of isobutene to methacrolein was caused by the significant sintering of the TeO/and not by a contamination of TeO2 by antimony. As for a possible contamination of 5b204by tellurium, TeO2 showed a counteractive tendency to crystallize and to leave part of the surface of Sb204free. On this basis, Oelker et al. [ 39] concluded that the synergy observed between antimony and tellurium oxides was due to a remote control where TeOE played the role of a relatively weak acceptor; catalytic sites were created on its surface by spillover oxygen emitted by o~-Sb204. Different phenomena seem to cause a dramatic increase in the activity of bis- muth-manganese oxide catalysts during the oxidative coupling of methane. According to the data [40], pure Bi2Mn4Oa0 compound (the freshly prepared 0.33BiMn sample) is non-selective in oxidative coupling of methane. This catalyst, as one can see from Table 3, has a very poor activity, yielding mainly carbon dioxide, during the first half hour of reaction, but the yield of C2 hydrocarbons increases as the reaction proceeds, to reach its steady-state value. As X-ray diffrac- tion showed, only after some Bi2Mn4Olo had decomposed to Bi203 and Mn203 under the conditions of the catalytic reaction, the system became able to catalyze the oxidative coupling of methane. The conclusion is that the catalyst becomes much more active and selective when it contains several phases and its surface is enriched in bismuth. It is impossible to predict, even in the form of speculation, whether the synergy between the Bi203 and Bi2MnaOlo-like compounds is due to a real remote control (namely a modification of the active sites of Bi203 by spillover oxygen), because both activity and selectivity of the mechanical mixture (0.33BiMn+ Bi203) also E.A. Mamedov / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 Table 4 Influence of reactive atmosphere on the surface composition (at.-%) of copper-molybdenum oxide catalyst for oxidation of propene [41 ] Sample Cu I Cu H Mo Cu/Mo Initial 22.3 0.0 77.7 0.29 After catalysis 8.1 17.8 74.1 0.35 Reduced 17.3 5.1 77.5 0.29 Reoxidized 2.9 22.3 74.8 0.34 continue to increase as a function of time-on-stream, being accompanied by the BizMn40~o decomposition to some extent and by an increase of the overall surface Bi/(Bi + Mn) ratio during the catalytic reaction (Table 3). These results indicate that an active and selective catalyst of a composition more complicated than at the start, is formed under the influence of the reaction mixture. It is a polyphasic solid, the surface of which is considerably enriched in bismuth compared to Bi2Mn4Olo. One can suggest that it might be an overlayer of the Bi203 advantageously supported on the BizMnaOlo-like phase. The enrichment of the surface in copper has been found for copper-molybdenum oxide catalysts during the oxidation of propene (Table 4). Such a surface transfor- mation, resulting in the drastic increase of selectivity to acrolein, seems to consist in the formation of surface clusters of Cu and Cu 2 + ions in the new environments rather than in the formation of new phases of Cu20 and CuMoO4, since the X-ray diffraction analysis did not reveal any change in the phase composition of the catalyst whereas X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the appearance of Cu2p two new peaks instead of that of the initial sample. It has been assumed [41 ] that clusters of MoO 3 formed as a result of the reaction 2Cu I MO 30 1 o ~ Cul O + 2Cu nMoO4 + 4MoO 3 (3) either migrate rapidly from the surface or are aggregated into large units, the proportion of the surface taken by molybdenum atoms being thus smaller than in Cu2M03010. Summarizing the data on catalytic properties and surface composition of vari- ously treated Cu-Mo catalysts, Haber et al. [41 ] conclude that, depending on the redox properties of the reactant mixture, different surface phases are formed at the surface of the catalyst, directing the reaction along different paths. 3.5. Surface re-dispersion Kremenic et al. [42,43] reported the total conversion of propene over silica- supported Mo-Fe-Te-Co oxide catalyst to increase to a constant value with time- on-stream, while the selectivities to acrolein and other products had practically not changed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and analytical elec- tron microscopy did not reveal any significant change in surface and phase com- E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 position as a result of the catalytic reaction. The observed decrease in XRD peak intensities for the used sample with respect to the fresh one was ascribed to an improvement of the dispersion of well-crystallized MoO 3 and Fe2 (MOO4)3 phases after interaction with the reaction mixture. This idea is favoured by the data of scanning electron microscopy and ion scattering spectroscopy studies [ 43 ], accord- ing to which both phases were dispersed on places where no Te was present. A further proof of the role of phase dispersion in catalyst activation was provided by chemisorption results [42]. These indicate that dispersion of active components on the support surface increased considerably with time-on-stream. As the equiv- alent molybdena area increased from 26.6 m2/g for a fresh catalyst to 37.0 m2/g for a used catalyst, the total conversion of propene increased from 8.5 % to 13.5 %. This mechanism of catalyst activation can explain the increase in overall activity during the reaction not accompanied by any significant change in selectivity. It seems to be probable for supported systems, the repeated interactions of which with the reactant mixture may change the size of the microcrystals of supported active components, thus improving their dispersion and catalytic activity. Since it suggests the absence of any modification of the surface as well as in the bulk composition, the intrinsic rate of reaction (rate per unit surface area of the active phase being dispersed during the reaction) is expected to remain unchanged while the total conversion may increase as the reaction proceeds to reach its steady state. 4. Subsurface restructuring This kind of catalyst activation seems to take place during silver catalyzed ethylene epoxidation. Clean silver surfaces yield an initial selectivity of ca. 40% which increases as the reaction proceeds, to reach a higher steady-state value. Such an activation of silver for ethylene epoxidation can be related to the reactive nature of an oxygen adspecies which is influenced by the electronic characteristics and structure of the silver surface. Experimental evidence and theoretical calculations indicate [44] that at least two forms of atomic oxygen exist on silver, namely surface-adsorbed and subsur- face-absorbed oxygen. Subsurface oxygen does not involve mere dissolution of oxygen in bulk, since this state could be completely saturated upon moderate exposure. It is more stable than bulk silver oxide; the range of temperatures and pressures studied in ref. [ 45 ] extended beyond the stability limits of the latter. As for its role in ethylene epoxidation, it has been shown [46] that in the absence of subsurface oxygen, oxygen adsorbed on the silver surface gives only carbon dioxide and water upon reaction with ethylene. In the presence of subsurface oxygen, the nature of the adsorbed oxygen changes and epoxide formation can occur as well. This indicates that subsurface oxygen plays a key role in forming the selective surface for epoxidation. Van Santen and De Groot [ 47] have proposed that acti- vation of a silver surface initially involves the filling of subsurface sites and that E.A. Mamedov / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 ethylene oxide production does not occur until after the subsurface is fully popu- lated. Moreover, they believe that subsurface oxygen atoms become incorporated in the epoxide upon exchange with adsorbed oxygen surface atoms. Most of the mentioned studies were primarily focused on the reactivity of equil- ibrated silver catalysts having known compositions. Recently, Svoboda et al. [48] have investigated the activation of silver powder for ethylene epoxidation at vacuum and atmospheric pressure using transient response techniques based on a TAP (temporal analysis of products) reactor system. The results indicate that the acti- vation process, being qualitatively the same in both pressure regimes, involves a concurrent filling of surface and subsurface sites, but the latter sites are filled at a much slower rate. According to this model, subsurface oxygen does not participate directly in the oxidation reaction but can modify the electronic properties of the surface. Specifically, it can withdraw electron density from the surface, thus increas- ing the electrophilic character of the silver surface atoms and oxygen adspecies, and may also reduce the bond energy between silver and adsorbed oxygen. In both cases, the reaction selectivity is expected to increase. Indeed, the rise in epoxide selectivity has been found to run in parallel with the increase in subsurface oxygen, but not with the increase in surface oxygen. These results provide evidence that the subsurface oxygen induced changes in electronic structure of the catalyst as well as in reactive characteristics of the oxygen adspecies are crucial to the formation of a selective surface. 5. Bulk restructuring There are numerous publications in the literature reporting various oxide catalysts to change their phase composition or/and structure during catalysis. Here we cite some examples of such a decomposition or formation of phases observed by using different techniques, e.g. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, elec- tron spin resonance, electron microscopy, M6ssbauer and Raman spectroscopy, etc. The segregation of Sb204 in the Sb-Sn [49,50] and Sb-V [51 ] oxide catalysts was observed during the selective oxidation of propene. Some of the (VO)2P20 7 phase was found to be transformed into the VOPO4 during the formation of the stable active V-P catalyst for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [52]. The reduction of V205 to V204 in a V-Mo oxide catalyst was observed in the oxidation of benzene and xylene [ 53 ]. Te2MoO 7, which was considered as an active phase in Te-Mo oxide catalysts, was revealed to decompose to a mixture of TeMo5Om6 and MoO3_~ after the ammoxidation of propene [54]. The decomposition of Fe2(MoO4)3 to give free MoO3 was observed in the oxidation of methanol [55]. Grasselli [56] reported that Bi3Fei02Om2 restructured to several phases, viz. Bi3FeMo2012, Bi2M03012, fl-FeMoO4 and Bi2MoO6 (trace), during the catalytic ammoxidation of propene. For Co-Bi-Fe-Mo oxide catalyst, Krylov and co-work- E.A. Mamedov / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 ers [ 57,58 ] found that Fe2 (MOO4) 3 was partially reduced to fl-FeMoO4. Similar results were obtained for another multicomponent bismuth molybdate catalyst containing also nickel, phosphorus and a small amount of potassium [ 59]. It is seen that oxide compounds prepared under particular conditions frequently decompose or segregate into several phases during catalysis, and that the actual working catalyst is a multiphasic system. Some catalysts, after restructuring, were more active and selective than the initial ones. Naturally, there were attempts to understand the reason why good catalysts contained two or more phases, and to elucidate the roles played by each phase. Since the approaches have been made from different points of view, different mechanisms have been advanced. Many of them have recently been reviewed by Weng and Delmon [ 29 ]. As for the catalyst activation induced by bulk restructuring under the reaction conditions, three main mechanisms have been put forward to explain this phenom- enon. Because of its importance for designing active and selective catalysts, it is interesting to discuss these mechanisms in some detail. 5.1. Formation of more active phases A VMo3OI 1 compound with irregular structure has been shown by Andrushkev- ich and co-workers [60-62] to be the active component of the vanadium-molyb- denum oxide catalysts for acrolein oxidation to acrylic acid. Basing on this finding, they have developed a preparative method, according to which an active and selec- tive catalyst can be prepared by stepwise calcining in air at 175 and 300, followed by activation at 400 in a reaction mixture containing acrolein, oxygen and water vapour. During the latter procedure, the formation of the VMo3011 phase occurs with reduction of V 5+ to V 4+, accompanied by an increase in both activity and selectivity. The high-temperature treatment of the catalyst under air results in the formation of V2MoO 8 and V205 solid solutions in MoO 3 which are not active in the oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid. The stability of V-Mo catalysts depends considerably on the oxygen-to-acrolein ratio in the activating mixture; its optimum has been found to be between 2.5 and 5.0. Under more reducing atmosphere, the active component decomposes to V204 and MOO2, while in oxygen-rich medium it is transformed to a mixture of V2MoO 8 and MoO3 phases. Another example illustrating the formation of a more selective phase under the influence of the reaction mixture is presented in Fig. 4. When using oxygen-rich mixtures, ferric oxide demonstrates poor selectivity in the oxidative dehydroge- nation of butene. Upon decreasing the oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture, a decrease in catalytic activity and an increase in butadiene selectivity are observed as a result of progressive reduction of the catalyst. The most drastic rise in selectivity takes place after ferric oxide has been transformed to ferroferric oxide which catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of butene with a rather high selectivity exceeding 60% [63].

Effect of oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture on the butene conversion ( 1 ) and butadiene selectivity (2), and on the phase composition of iron oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of butene [63]. Similar results were obtained for copper oxide catalyst in the oxidation of pro- pene. Under the conditions of the experiments described in ref. [ 12], changes in the composition of the feed gas caused profound changes in the phase composition of the catalyst. Decreasing the oxygen pressure at a fixed partial pressure of the alkene resulted in a reduction of cupric oxide to various compositions. Comparison of the reaction rate data with in-situ measurements of electrical conductance indi- cated that the most active solid phase for acrolein formation was stoichiometric cuprous oxide while oxygen-rich cuprous oxide and cupric oxide favoured complete oxidation of propene to carbon dioxide and water. Less clear conclusions can be derived about the activation of vanadium-phos- phorus oxide catalysts during the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. It is well known that industrial catalysts need an extended period of time (typically 200-500 h) to become stable active catalysts [64-66]. A catalyst which has been exposed for this time to an air-butane mixture at reaction temperatures is usually called 'equilibrated' [ 67]. During the break-in period, the 'non-equilibrated' cat- alyst undergoes changes in vanadium oxidation state and the relative concentrations of different VPO phases. Extensive analysis of the equilibrated catalyst samples shows the presence of a single XRD monophasic (VO)2P207 compound, a P/V bulk ratio close to 1.0 and the average vanadium oxidation state close to 4 + [64- 66,68]. It also has been shown that catalytic behaviours of non-equilibrated and equilibrated catalysts are markedly different [69] and that the catalyst treatment with the reaction mixture results in reduction of the catalyst [70,71 ]. Furthermore, equilibrated industrial catalysts display a decreased rate of V 4oxidation to V 5 + of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in standard oxidation tests [66]. Due also to the presence of the stable adsorbed species formed during the catalytic reaction E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 [ 72,73 ], equilibrated samples are very stable against oxidation. All these facts give good evidence that the activation of vanadium-phosphorus oxide catalysts under the reaction conditions could be associated with a complete transformation of various VPO phases, at first VOPO4 turns into the (VO)2P207 phase which is considered by many researchers [ 64,66,74-76 ] to be an active component of these catalysts. On the other hand, some papers [ 77-79] claim that the catalysts consisting of both (VO)2P207 and VOPO 4 are the best. Moreover, a recent in-situ X-ray dif- fraction study by Overbeek et al. [80] has shown that the phases active in the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride differ greatly in structure under the reaction conditions from that of vanadyl pyrophosphate which has been identified after catalytic tests. So, a further effort in studying the real nature of the active compo- sition of V-P oxide catalysts during the catalytic reaction with a use of in-situ characterization techniques is necessary. 5.2. Formation of structurally coherent phase boundaries Krylov and co-workers [ 57,58,81 ] have studied the Co-Fe-Bi-Mo oxide cata- lyst in the selective oxidation of propene to acrolein. By means of X-ray diffraction and in-situ 57Fe Mrssbauer spectroscopy measurements, they found that four phases coexisted in the starting catalyst: Bi2(MoOn)3, Fe2 (MoOn)3, CoM4 and MoO 3. Under reaction conditions, only Fe2(MoO4)3 was partially reduced to fl-FeMoO4 while others remained unchanged. The interesting point was that this reduction occurred only when CoMoO4 was present. The authors have assumed that the following reduction with a release of lattice oxygen OL from the solid takes place during the catalytic reaction: Fe2 (MoOn) 3 \"0 (2FeMoO4 MoO 3) + OL (4) The oxygen species coming from ferric molybdate are transported to the B i2 ( MoOn ) 3-Fe2 (MoOn) 3 boundaries where they react with the propene adsorbed on Bi2(MoOn)3- Gaseous oxygen activation occurs on the Fe2(MoO4)3-FeMoO4 boundary, giving the reactive oxygen species OL which then diffuses via FezMo3012_ x to the reaction sites. Cobalt molybdate stabilizes ferrous molybdate, while molybdenum oxide is only used for controlling the stoichiometry of the transformation (4) during the reaction. According to this mechanism, a higher activity of multicomponent catalysts in comparison with the bismuth molybdate catalyst has been explained [57] by a larger amount of reactive oxygen species rapidly supplied for the reaction by the iron molybdate along the Fe2 (MoOn)3-FeMoO4 boundary. To let boundaries func- tion properly, the active phases are considered [ 81 ] to be structurally coherent, and their microcrystallites to have the same sizes. The ability of individual phases in a multiphase system to exhibit epitaxially matched cohabitation is stressed by Grasselli [ 56] upon interpreting the increase E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 65 Table 5 Oxidative coupling of methane over Bi-containing oxide catalysts at 780 and CH4/O2/He = 30/15/55 [82] Sample Surf. area Rate 10-17 Selectivity (m2/g) (molec.

Extensive analysis of the catalyst has revealed that its restructuring is caused by an on-stream reaction. The used catalyst is a multiphase solid consisting of unreacted BiaFeMoEOt2, in combination with BiE(MOO4) 3, /3-FeMoO4 and a small amount of Bi2MoO6. The high temperature fl-FeMoO4 is stabilized by the presence of B i 2 (MOO4)3 since bismuth molybdate can serve as a template for the nucleation and growth of this ferrous molybdate phase, due to the excellent struc- tural match between the (010) crystal planes of the two phases. Based on the previously identified redox role of iron, Grasselli [ 56 ] suggests that the fl-FeMoO4 phase functions as the centre for the dissociative chemisorption of gaseous oxygen and the transfer of oxide ions, across a coherent phase boundary, to the catalytically active bismuth molybdate phase, thus enhancing its activity. As one can see, this interpretation does not differ strongly from that proposed by Krylov et al. for the Co-Fe-Bi-Mo oxide catalyst. A similar approach is used by Zhereb et at. [82] for interpreting the catalytic behaviour of BiEGeO5 in the oxidative coupling of methane. This metastable mate- rial has been found to decompose to a mixture of Bi12GeO2o and Bi4Ge3012 phases under the reaction conditions. Its activity, as seen from Table 5, is much higher than that of individual BilEGeO20 and Bi4Ge3Oi2 compounds prepared by thermal decomposition of single crystals. A mechanical mixture of these substances with a ratio corresponding to the BiEGeO5 compound (Mixture l) neither shows high activity, which, however, considerably increases after grinding (Mixture 2). The same results were obtained for BiESiO5 and its decomposition products. Taking into account these data and the results of scanning electron microscopy investiga- tions, an increased activity of the two-phase catalytic system formed under the influence of the reaction atmosphere has been related to the formation of 'boundary' zones between separate phases. These are supposed to possess a high concentration of defects, in particular anion vacancies, which can serve as the sites for di-oxygen activation. E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 The specific role played by coherent interfaces in selective oxidation reactions was also mentioned by some other researchers [ 83-86] upon discussing the mech- anisms of action of various multiphase oxide catalysts. But they have no concern with the catalyst activation under the reaction conditions. 5.3. Remote control mechanism A remote control mechanism, according to which the mobile species, such as spillover oxygen, emitted by one phase creates or regenerates active and selective sites on another phase, was put forward by Delmon and co-workers [87-89] to explain synergetic effects between separate phases frequently observed in multi- phase catalysts for selective oxidation. In their recent review paper [29], they proposed that spillover oxygen can also prevent the deactivation of the catalyst by eliminating deposited coke as well as by inhibiting deep reduction of the catalyst which leads, in certain cases, to a decomposition of the active phase. In principle, the remote control concept can be used to explain the catalyst activation caused by phase transformations during the catalytic reaction. Before such a conclusion can be reached, there must be strong evidence that neither the appearance of a new phase nor the formation of a contaminating (or supported) layer, when the surface of one phase is enriched in an element of the other phase, are responsible for the increase in activity and/or selectivity of the starting catalyst. Possible changes of oxidation state or dispersion have to be checked as well. Analysis of the literature on reaction-induced activation of selective oxidation catalysts revealed only one paper relating this phenomenon to a remote controlled cooperation between initially present and newly formed phases in the catalyst. This is our joint publication with the group of Delmon (Baidikova et al. [90] ) in which some speculations were done to explain the dramatic increase in catalytic activity of the Bi-Mn oxide during the oxidative coupling of methane. One of them was that a bismuth-depleted Bi2Mn4010-1ike phase could donate spillover oxygen to Bi203 and make it more active. From the viewpoint of the author of this review, the results reported in ref. [ 90] are more consistent with the idea that an active and selective catalyst formed under the reaction conditions has a more complicated composition than a mixture of these phases, as has been discussed above in Section 3.4. At the same time, the concept of remote control can meet with success when used as an alternative interpretation of some literature data. For instance, in Gras- selli's model for the restructured Bi-Fe-Mo oxide catalyst described in the previous section, the newly formed fl-FeMoO4 phase can be considered as a donor which dissociates molecular oxygen to form a surface mobile species. These active oxygen atoms then spill over to and irrigate the catalytically active Bi2(MoO4) 3 phase (acceptor), thus enhancing its activity. In order to establish what kind of functions, the creation of active sites, the regeneration of catalytic sites or others, is performed by spillover oxygen, a special investigation programme is to be carried out. Another E.A. Mamedov /Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 point for which there is no evidence is the donor role of ferrous molybdate. The donor-acceptor classification of the various oxides used in catalytic oxidation [29 ] does not contain this compound. On the other hand, ferric molybdate, which has been shown [57,91 ] to be reduced to ferrous molybdate under the conditions of the catalytic reaction, has intermediate positions in both donor and acceptor scales. So, to ascertain whether the fl-FeMoO4phase plays the proposed role of donor in the restructured Bi-Fe-Mo oxide catalyst, specially designed experiments are needed. 6. Concluding remarks In this review clear evidence has been presented that an increase in catalytic activity and/or selectivity during the reaction is widespread for oxidation catalysts. As a rule, it is caused by catalyst restructuring occurring in response to its chemical environment. Structural changes occur at the surface as well as in the bulk of catalytic systems, and different mechanisms for these changes exist. Some of them are contradictory, even when the same system is considered. The main reason for this situation is that the approaches have been made from different points of view regarding the nature of catalyst's active component. In most publications, the samples have been characterized before and after reaction in order to detect changes which might take place in the catalyst during the reaction. Such characterization of the same system carried out by different research groups may give different results since the catalyst structure after reaction frequently depends on the used reactant composition. Moreover, it may differ from the real structure operating under the conditions of the catalytic reaction. Therefore, it is very important to undertake a physico-chemical characterization during catalysis under standard conditions. There are unfortunately only few techniques available which permit in-situ meas- urements. This problem requires considerable effort and the development of new techniques to characterize in situ the catalyst dynamics, which is particularly impor- tant for understanding the real structure of the active surface with a consequent correct approach to the modelling of the reaction mechanism. The practical aspect of the considered phenomenon has become of major signif- icance in light of new nonsteady-state processing approaches to selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [92-94]. To design a catalyst able to operate effectively, for instance, under the conditions of cyclic reduction-oxidation processes, one has to know how it stores oxygen and if the stored oxygen is utilized selectively. This information can be obtained by exposing the catalyst to various reaction mixtures and detecting the changes in the catalyst resulting from these exposures. It is also important for the catalytic processes which operate under other artificially created nonsteady-state conditions with the aim to get the highest yield of the desired product. In these cases, catalyst composition changes with time-on-stream, gradu- ally reaching its steady state, and reaction kinetic measurements for a series of E.A. Mamedov / Applied Catalysis A: General 116 (1994) 49-70 catalyst compositions over the range of possible variations are to be done. Only on the basis of these data, a complete kinetic model of the process, which is needed for mathematical modelling and reactor design, can be worked out.

This review concerns selective oxidation catalysts which often exhibit an increase in activity or/ and selectivity as the reaction proceeds to reach its steady state. The objective is to discuss the possible reasons of this phenomenon. The evidence is presented that the activation of most of the reviewed catalysts was caused by the reaction-induced restructuring observed to occur at the surface as well as in the bulk of catalyst. Different mechanisms, such as removal of weakly bound oxygen, creation of active sites, deposition of carbonaceous material, formation of new phases or overlayers, remote controlled cooperation between separate phases and others, are discussed. These changes in catalyst composition are to be taken into account both for modelling the reaction mechanism and kinetics.

        "dc:description": "This review concerns selective oxidation catalysts which often exhibit an increase in activity or/ and selectivity as the reaction proceeds to reach its steady state. The objective is to discuss the possible reasons of this phenomenon. The evidence is presented that the activation of most of the reviewed catalysts was caused by the reaction-induced restructuring observed to occur at the surface as well as in the bulk of catalyst. Different mechanisms, such as removal of weakly bound oxygen, creation of active sites, deposition of carbonaceous material, formation of new phases or overlayers, remote controlled cooperation between separate phases and others, are discussed. These changes in catalyst composition are to be taken into account both for modelling the reaction mechanism and kinetics.",
