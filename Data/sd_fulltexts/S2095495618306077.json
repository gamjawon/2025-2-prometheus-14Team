School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering Queensland University of Technology Brisbane, QLD 4001 Australia Rational design of low-cost, highly electrocatalytic activity, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been a great significant for metal–air batteries. Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-Pg) is fabricated for Zn–air batteries. A low-cost biomass peach gum, consisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen without other heteroatoms, was used as carbon source to form carbon matrix hosting hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the melamine was applied as nitrogen source and template precursor, which can convert to carbon-based template graphitic carbon nitride by polycondensation process. Owing to the unique structure and synergistic effect between hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C species, the proposal Co/N-Pg catalyst displays not only prominent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER, but also excellent durability. Remarkably, the assembled Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg air electrode exhibited a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.81 V at 50 mA cm–2) and high peak power density (119 mW cm–2) with long-term cycling stability. This work presents an effective approach for engineering transition metal oxides and nitrogen modified carbon nanosheets to boost the performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn–air battery. Graphical abstract Hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets were synthesized via low-cost biomass-derived peach gum for the Zn–air batteries. The assembled Zn–air battery exhibited a high peak power density and long-term cycling stability.

They have been considered to be promising candidates to address the energy and environment challenges due to their high theoretical power density and environmental friendliness [2]. Among various energy storage devices, Zn–air batteries with considerably high theoretical energy density (1086 Wh kg–1), low cost, safety and reliable nature have attracted much attention [3]. Catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for enhancing efficiency, stability and cycle life of air cathode for Zn–air battery [4]. Up to now, Pt-based and Ir/Ru-based noble metals are widely applied for ORR and OER, respectively. However, Pt-based and Ir/Ru-based catalysts suffer from high cost and scarcity [5], which hinder the wide spread practical applications of Zn–air batteries [6]. Hence, great efforts have been devoted to design and synthesize the highly efficient, long-time stability and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts, such as nanocarbon materials, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, and their hybrids [7,8]. Recently, heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts have attracted much attention owing to their facile synthesis, low prices and especially the high activities [9,10]. Heteroatoms can effectively modify the charge/spin distribution on the sp 2-conjugated carbon matrix [11], facilitating the oxygen adsorption, breaking O–O bond and leading to outstanding electrocatalytic activities [12]. Due to the high electronegativity, nitrogen atoms are usually introduced into the carbon frameworks to enhance the surface polarity and electron-donor propensity of carbon nanomaterials, resulting in the enhanced electrocatalytic activity [13]. To further improve the catalytic activites of electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, transition metals (e.g. Fe, Co and Ni) have been introduced into nitrogen-doped carbon [14,15]. The coordination between nitrogen-doping and transition metal can availably adjust the local electronic structure, promote the oxygen adsorption, and ultimately enhance the electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER [16,17]. Carbon materials derived from biomass have captured attention due to the extensive availability, economic affordability and biological recyclability [18,19]. Polysaccharides including glucose, fructose, and chitosan have been applied extensively as carbon precursors [20–23]. In view of the components of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen without other heteroatoms, polysaccharides can be promising carbon precursors with controllable metal and nitrogen-doping to synthesize metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) hybrids. Peach gum is a kind of polysaccharide obtained from peach trees, which can be easily found around the world. The peach gum can be applied as a promising abundant and low-cost precursor for development of carbon based electrocatalysts. In this work, we design a cost-effective approach to synthesize hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-Pg) for ORR and OER. Peach gum was employed as a carbon precursor for producing conductive carbon matrix to host cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C sites by hydrothermal treatment and further pyrolysis (Fig. 1 and Experimental Section). The melamine was applied as nitrogen source, which can be converted to graphitic carbon nitride by polycondensation process in 500 °C [24]. The graphitic carbon nitride can simultaneously play the roles of template and nitrogen source to fabricate Co/N-Pg nanosheets by further pyrolysis at 800 °C [25]. The Co/N-Pg catalyst presents high ORR catalytic activity with excellent four-electron selectivity and a low OER overpotential in alkaline condition. Moreover, the primary Zn–air battery assembled with Co/N-Pg catalyst exhibits a low discharge/charge overpotential and outstanding stability, which has a bright potential for practical applications on rechargeable Zn–air batteries. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Melamine, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and potassium hydroxide were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Nafion solution (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst was obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemicals Co., Ltd. All of these chemicals were used without further treatment. Peach gum was obtained from peach trees in Wuhan city (Hubei province, China) and purchased from supermarket in Zhenjiang. 2.2 Synthesis of hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-Pg) To synthesize the Co/N-Pg catalyst, 1.0 g of peach gum was added into 40 mL of deionized water and heated at 80 °C until completed dissolution. Then, 0.7 g of cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate and 0.25 g of melamine were added into the above solution under stirring. After 6 h of continuous stirring, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h to obtain precursors. After being washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, the precursors were dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h. Finally, the precursors were placed into an alumina crucible with a cover. Then, the alumina crucible was put into a quarter tube furnace (SK-G08123K-2-420, Tianjin Zhonghuan Lab Furnace Co., Ltd) and annealed at 800°C for 2 h with a rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere (50 sccm). For comparison, cobalt-doped carbon (Co/Pg) and nitrogen-doped carbon (N-Pg) samples were fabricated by the same procedure without the addition of melamine and cobalt salt, respectively. 2.3 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu, XRD-6000X-ray) with high-intensity Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) were utilized to evaluate the morphology and crystal structure of all prepared catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (PHI5300) with a monochromatic Mg Kα source. Raman spectra were carried out on Renishaw Invia with a 532 nm excitation laser. Specific surface areas and pore size distributions were obtained from nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA) by using Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) and Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and structural characterization XRD analysis has been used to identify the crystallinity of as-prepared samples (Figs. 1a and S1). As demonstrated in Fig. 1(a), a distinct peak at 26° corresponding to the plane (002) of graphitic carbon can be observed in Co/N-Pg. The high intensity of the diffraction peak also demonstrates a high degree of graphitization [26]. The two peaks at 36.5° and 42.4° can be indexed to crystalline facets of CoO (111) and CoO (200) (JCPDS No. 43-1004), suggesting that cobalt ions change successfully into cobalt oxides by pyrolysis. Furthermore, the peaks located at 43.7°, 50.8° and 74.9° in Co/N-Pg can be assigned to Co4N phase [27,28], indicating that cobalt ions partly converted into Co4N under nitridation reaction. The structure and morphology of as-prepared samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images of Co/N-Pg reveal the nanosheet structure (Fig. S2a, b). Cobalt oxide nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the carbon layer. TEM image of the Co/N-Pg illustrates that the cobalt oxide nanoparticles with the size of about 10–50 nm are encapsulated in carbon-sheet layers (Fig. 2 b). The corresponding particle size distribution histogram (Fig. 2b inset 1) demonstrates that the nanoparticles have an average size of 29.4 nm. From enlarged TEM image (Fig. 2b inset 2), the hollow structure of cobalt oxide nanoparticles can be observed clearly. The hollow structure of cobalt oxide nanoparticles results from the Kirkendall effect in pyrolysis [29]. Cobalt ions are encircled in carbonaceous shell by hydrothermal carbonization process. The diffusion rate of cobalt is heterogeneous in carbonaceous shell during pyrolysis, resulting in irregular hollow structure of cobalt oxides. The high-resolution TEM image shows clearly that cobalt oxides nanoparticles are surrounded by graphitic carbon layers (Fig. 2c). The thickness of carbon layer varies at different sites. The bright discrete diffraction spots in selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern disclose the polycrystalline structure of Co/N-Pg from scattered dots of cobalt oxides and ring of carbon (Fig. 2c inset). The elemental distribution of Co/N-Pg is demonstrated in the TEM elemental mapping images (Fig. 2d). It reveals that the N heteroatoms are homogenously distributed on carbon nanosheets. However, the nanosheet structure failed to fabricate in the absence of cobalt salt or melamine. As shown in Fig. S2, the nitrogen-doped carbon (N-Pg) synthesized without adding cobalt salt consists of cross-linking carbon structure (Fig. S2c, d). SEM images of cobalt-doped carbon (Co/Pg) demonstrate that carbonized spheres with about 1–5 μm diameter are formed in the absence of melamine (Fig. S2e, f). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of Co/N-Pg shows distinctive peaks of Co, O, N, and C (Fig. S3). High-resolution N 1s spectrum of Co/N-Pg can be deconvoluted into five peaks at around 398.4, 399.1, 400.9, 401.7 and 403.9 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, Co-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and oxidized-N (Fig. 3 a) [30]. The transition metal cobalt can coordinate with pyridinic-N to form Co-N-C structure, which contributes to adjust the local electronic structure and enhance the electrocatalytic activity [24]. As shown in the Fig. 3(b), the high-resolution O 1 s spectrum of Co/N-Pg possesses three subpeaks of hydroxyls (≈ 533.5 eV), carboxyls (≈ 531.8 eV) and oxygen related to the cobalt oxides (≈ 530.2 eV) [31]. High-resolution Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c) shows the two strongest peaks located at around 780.5 and 795.6 eV, which can be ascribed to Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2, respectively [32,33]. The two peaks at about 785.0 and 805.0 eV can be identified as the shake-up peaks [34]. For comparison, XPS of N-Pg was also tested and shown in Fig. S4. Compared with C 1 s spectrum of N-Pg, the peak of C–N bond shifts positively in C 1 s spectrum of Co/N-Pg (Fig. 3d), indicating strong interaction between Co and N atoms, which attributes to the electron-withdrawing effect of Co [7]. The Raman spectrum shown in Fig. S5 reveals the characteristic G (1580 cm–1) and D (1350 cm–1) bands of carbon, which correspond to graphitic and disordered or defect carbon, respectively [35]. The I D/I G value of Co/N-Pg is slightly higher than that of N-Pg and Co/Pg samples. The higher ratio of I D/I G means the more disorder and defect in carbon structure, which contributes to additional active sites for the improvement of catalytic activity [36]. The N2 adsorption-sorption measurements were taken to investigate the specific surface area and porous features of the as-prepared samples (Fig. S6 and Table S1). The specific surface area of Co/N-Pg is determined to be 307 m2 g–1. The Co/N-Pg displays a typical type-IV isotherm with the distinct hysteresis loop in the range of 0.4–0.8 P/P 0, indicating the coexistence of micropores and mesopores [37,38], which are beneficial for exposure of more accessible active sites for electrochemical reactions [39]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic tests for ORR and OER The ORR catalytic activities of synthesized samples were investigated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in Fig. S7 show that all synthesized catalysts exhibit palpable cathodic peak current in O2-saturated electrolyte and only capacitive current in the N2-saturated electrolyte. The cathodic peak potential of Co/N-Pg is 0.81 V which is approximate to that of Pt/C (0.86 V). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves have been obtained to compare the ORR electrocatalytic activity of synthesized samples (Fig. 4 a). Remarkably, Co/N-Pg displays a half-wave potential of 0.82 V, which is more positive than that of N-Pg (0.64 V) and Co/Pg (0.69 V). Although the half-wave potential of Co/N-Pg is a little inferior than that of Pt/C (0.86 V), the diffusion-limited current density (5.40 mA cm–2 at 0.4 V) is higher than that of Pt/C (5.31 mA cm–2 at 0.4 V), suggesting that the ORR activity of Co/N-Pg is significantly enhanced after introducing cobalt and nitrogen. The corresponding Tafel plots are calculated in Fig. 4(b). The Tafel slope of Co/N-Pg is equal to that of Pt/C (61 mV dec–1) and much lower than that of Co/Pg (86 mV dec–1) and N-Pg (153 mV dec–1), which means the favorable kinetics of Co/N-Pg catalyst in ORR process [40]. The Koutechy–Levich (K-L) plots of Co/N-Pg and Pt/C have been calculated from LSV curves at different rotating speeds (Figs. 4c and S8). A good linearity and the similar slopes indicate the first-order reaction kinetics [41]. RRDE tests have been conducted to further quantify the electrocatalytic efficiency of Co/N-Pg. The ring current of Co/N-Pg is almost undetectable compared with disk current (Fig. S9a). The H2O2 yield of Co/N-Pg is below 10% over the range of 0–0.8 V (Fig. S9b). The electron transfer number value of Co/N-Pg is about 3.8–3.9, which further indicates a quasi-four-electron pathway for oxygen reduction. The RRDE result of Co/N-Pg is resembled to that of Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S9c, d), indicating the remarkably high electrocatalytic efficiency of Co/N-Pg for ORR. The ORR stability of Co/N-Pg has been tested by chronoamperometric responses measurement. As depicted in Fig. 4(d), the current density of Co/N-Pg retains 98.2% after 12,000 s at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm, whereas the current density of Pt/C catalyst displays 87.6% retention in the same condition. The high stability of Co/N-Pg can be attributed to the carbon layers formed by two steps thermal treatment of peach gum. Carbon layers can protect cobalt oxide nanoparticles from being dissolved in the electrolyte, aggregating into larger particles and detaching from the support, which often occurs on Pt/C catalysts [26]. To evaluate the corrosion resistance of Co/N-Pg, the methanol tolerant ability of the Co/N-Pg catalyst and Pt/C catalyst has been also compared by chronoamperometry and CV measurements. As demonstrated in the Fig. S10, the current of Pt/C ascends to positive significantly after the addition of 3 mL methanol, which can be attributed to the oxidation of methanol on Pt/C. There is no distinct change in the current of Co/N-Pg catalyst after introducing methanol. Furthermore, the corresponding CV curve of Co/N-Pg exhibits almost unnoticeable change after adding methanol (Fig. S11a). In contrast, an obvious anodic oxidation peak of methanol can be observed in CV curve of Pt/C (Fig. S11b). The results indicate that the Co/N-Pg exhibits the outstanding methanol resistance. The OER performances of prepared samples have been evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The results have been summarized in Table S2 with other parameters. LSV polarization curves for OER show that the potential of Co/N-Pg is 1.63 V at the current density of 10 mA cm–2, which is much lower than that of Pt/C catalyst (1.99 V) (Fig. 5 a). After LSV test, distinct O2 bubbles can be observed on the surface of glassy carbon electrode loading with Co/N-Pg catalyst (Fig. S12), which validates the excellent OER performance of Co/N-Pg catalyst. Corresponding Tafel plots were obtained to examine the OER catalytic kinetics of as-obtained samples. As shown in the Fig. 5(b), Tafel slopes are calculated to be 70, 178, 184, 215 mV dec–1 for Co/N-Pg, Co/Pg, N-Pg and Pt/C, respectively. The small Tafel slope indicates favorable OER kinetics of Co/N-Pg. Furthermore, the OER reaction kinetics was also assessed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plot of Co/N-Pg shows a smaller interface charge-transfer resistance than that of the control samples (Fig. 5c), suggesting that the Co/N-Pg possesses more favorable charge-transfer capacity, which facilitates the OER process. The accelerated durability test for OER has been conducted in 0.1 M KOH to investigate the stability of catalyst. As shown in OER polarization curves (Fig. 5d), the potential of Co/N-Pg at 10 mA/cm–2 shifts positively by about 6 mV after 200 continuous cyclic voltammetry cycling owing to the evolution of O2 bubbles, which result in the exfoliation of electrocatalyst from electrode [42]. The double layer capacitance (C dl) of all prepared samples has been investigated. As depicted in Fig. S13, Co/N-Pg exhibits much larger C dl (13.9 mF cm–2) than Co/Pg (4.1 mF cm–2) and N-Pg (3.1 mF cm–2). The value of the C dl is proportional to the active surface area of electrocatalysts [43]. The hollow structure of cobalt oxide nanoparticles can expose more active sites, which endow the Co/N-Pg catalyst with comparable ORR and OER activities. The Co/N-Pg catalyst exhibits an oxygen electrode activity parameter ΔE (ΔE = Ej =10,OER−Ej =1/2,ORR) of 0.81 V, which is comparable to that of cobalt-based bifunctional catalysts reported recently (Table S3). The small ΔE implies the outstanding bifunctional catalytic activities of Co/N-Pg catalyst, which has much more potential for practical applications in rechargeable metal–air batteries [44,45]. Although nitrogen-coordinated metal centers are generally considered to be active sites toward electrocatalytic process [39,46], the contribution from metal oxide nanoparticles cannot be ignored. Hence, control experiments have been performed in order to clarify the role of cobalt oxide nanoparticles in ORR and OER. The Co/N-Pg catalyst was dipped in 1 M HCl and stirred for 12 h to remove cobalt oxides. Compared with Co/N-Pg before acid etching, Co/N-Pg after acid etching displays inferior activities for both ORR and OER (Fig. 6 a, b). The half-wave potential of Co/N-Pg after acid etching is reduced to 0.77 V for ORR. The operating potential of Co/N-Pg after acid etching is shifted to 1.73 V at the current density of 10 mA cm–2 for OER. The enormous contrast of the electrocatalytic performances of Co/N-Pg before and after acid etching is due to the loss of the cobalt oxides. In addition, thiocyanate ion (SCN–) poisoning experiments were carried out. SCN– ions were known to strongly coordinate with metal and poison the metal-nitrogen coordination catalytic sites [47]. As shown in Fig. S14, the electrocatalytic performances for both ORR and OER show a decline after adding 10 mM KSCN. The OER activity of Co/N-Pg suffers from more adverse effects than that of ORR, suggesting that Co4N in Co/N-Pg contributes mainly to the electrocatalytic performances toward OER. Thus, the results reveal that cobalt oxide particles in Co/N-Pg play an important role in both ORR and OER, while Co4N species are essential for OER due to its intrinsic desirable electrical conductivity [48]. The outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of Co/N-Pg can be attributed to rational design and synthesis method of catalyst: (1) Cobalt-based nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon are beneficial for enhancing electrocatalytic activities [49,50]. The hollow structure of cobalt oxide nanoparticles can further provide sufficient active sites with short ion-diffusion length. (2) Cobalt oxide nanoparticles coordinated with nitrogen atoms in Co/N-Pg hybrid can produce Co-N-C species, which can act as a bond bridge to link the cobalt oxide nanoparticles and N-doped carbon lattice, contributing to increase the active sites for ORR and OER [32,51]. At the same time, the advent of the Co4N species in Co/N-Pg provides additional high active sites toward OER. The synergistic effects of cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C species lead to desirable bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalytic performances. (3) Meanwhile, N-doped carbon shell can improve charge transport capacity during catalysis process. The N-doped carbon shell fabricated from peach gum also can protect cobalt oxide nanoparticles from being dissolved in the electrolyte, aggregating into larger particles, hence resulting in the outstanding stability of Co/N-Pg catalyst. 3.3 Zn–air batteries tests The two-electrode rechargeable Zn–air battery has been assembled with Co/N-Pg coated porous carbon paper as air cathode. The commercial Pt/C catalyst has been also tested for comparison. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery with Co/N-Pg cathode has been determined to be 1.47 V, which is close to that of the battery with Pt/C cathode (1.54 V) (Figs. 7 a and S15). A LED plane can be powered by two Zn–air batteries connected in series (Fig. 7b). Charge and discharge polarization curves show that the Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg cathode exhibits lower charge–discharge voltage gap (0.81 V) than the Zn–air battery with Pt/C cathode (1.07 V) at the current density of 50 mA cm–2 (Fig. 7c), indicating the improved recharge ability of Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg cathode. The discharge polarization curves and corresponding power density of single battery have been presented in Fig. 7(d). The maximum power density of Co/N-Pg cathode is as high as 119 mW cm–2, which is 94.6% to that of Pt/C cathode (125.8 mW cm–2). The cyclic stability of Co/N-Pg cathode has been investigated by galvanostatic discharge and charge test at the current density of 10 mA cm–2 (5 min for discharging and 5 min for charging). As demonstrated in Fig. 7(e), the initial voltage efficiency of rechargeable Zn–air battery with is 58.5%. After 32 h cycle test, the charging potential and discharging potential of Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg cathode show little changes. For comparison, a gradual increasing in the charging potential and decreasing in the discharging potential is observed for Pt/C cathode. After 5 h, the potential of discharging decreases from 1.21 to 1.02 V, and the charge potential increases from 2.08 to 2.15 V. These results verify a better long cycle life of Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg cathode than that of Zn–air battery with Pt/C cathode. 4 Conclusions In summary, a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets was successfully synthesized by two steps of thermal treatments. The low-cost biomass-derived peach gum was used as carbon source to form carbon matrix hosting hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles. The melamine was applied as nitrogen sources and template precursors. Attributed to the unique structure and synergistic effects between hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C species, the Co/N-Pg catalyst displays remarkably efficient catalytic activities and durability for both ORR and OER. The results can reveal that the simultaneous integration of Co-N-C structure and hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles can boost electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the primary Zn–air battery assembled with Co/N-Pg air cathode displays a high peak power density and excellent stability. This work extends the development of sustainable and highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn–air battery from cheap and earth-abundant source.

        "dc:description": "Rational design of low-cost, highly electrocatalytic activity, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been a great significant for metal–air batteries. Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-Pg) is fabricated for Zn–air batteries. A low-cost biomass peach gum, consisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen without other heteroatoms, was used as carbon source to form carbon matrix hosting hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the melamine was applied as nitrogen source and template precursor, which can convert to carbon-based template graphitic carbon nitride by polycondensation process. Owing to the unique structure and synergistic effect between hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C species, the proposal Co/N-Pg catalyst displays not only prominent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER, but also excellent durability. Remarkably, the assembled Zn–air battery with Co/N-Pg air electrode exhibited a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.81 V at 50 mA cm–2) and high peak power density (119 mW cm–2) with long-term cycling stability. This work presents an effective approach for engineering transition metal oxides and nitrogen modified carbon nanosheets to boost the performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn–air battery.",
