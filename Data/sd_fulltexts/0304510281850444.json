(Received January 5. 1981) The hydration of acetylene to give aceiaIdeb.y de has been an important industrial reaction, catalyzed in aqueous H?S0 containing He+ and Fes+ ions (1j . There is substantial evidence that reaction occurs via formation of acetylene complexes with Hg2 + , and the following cycle involving H+ and Hg 2+ car be suggested [2, 31: Hit CH? =CHOH CH$ CHI g-9 o (CD 2+ H CH H g\\ lOH G=c H H The role of Fey\"\" may be to reoxidizc Hg' to He' and maintain the mercury in the active form E1a, cl. 390 Ion-exchange resins containing H' and He' have long been known as catalysts for acetylene hydration [4] , and our intent was to test resins containing H , He,, and Fe\" as potential t '~nctional catalysts. Macroporous ion-exchange resin [sal-fonated pssly(styrene-divinylbenzene),Amberlyst 15, Rohm and Haas] was washed with water and methanol. then converted into the acid form by repeated. contact with excess HN03 (2 M). gesin containing Hg2' ion was then prepared by contacting 0.51 of wet resin with 0.5 1 of a saturates solution of Hg(N03)?. in water; the procedure was repeated 24 times. The resins containing various concentrations of H' and He' iods were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of the H~form resin and that containing He,; the mixture was allowed to achieve ion-exchange equilibrium in water. The resins containing Felt were prepared similarly, with aqueous Fe(N03).~ as starting material; a sample containing 2.2 edvliv. 9o He, was mixed with the Fe\" -containing resin in varying proportions (approximately 2:1 and 1:2) and allowed to achieve ion-exchange equilibrium in water.

The reactor, containing 50 ml of water, was brought to temperature, the catalyst particles added, and an equimolar acetylene-helium stream bubbled into tile solution for 5 minutes, saturating it. The reactor was capped, and liquid samples were drawn periodically over a 10-minute period and analyzed by gas chromatography. Plots of conversion `u acetaldehyde vs- time were linear, and the slope of each determined the catalytic activity, defined as the initial rate of the reaction. The rate data, plotted as a function of catalyst composition in Fig. 1, show that increasing the Hg2 *- content in the resin, which was predominantly in the acid form, proportionately increased the catalytic activity, confirming the catalytic role of the Hg2'. The resins containing Fe\" were more active than those without Fe 3+ at the same Hg 2~ concentration, demonstrating that Fe a~ played the role of another catalyst. 17e infer that the ion-exchange resin was a trifunctional catalyst, its functions being analogous to those of the three cations in aqueous solution.
