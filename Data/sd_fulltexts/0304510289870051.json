Ethanol inhibits the catalytic system. Introduction Following the report by Groves and Quinn that ^rans-dioxotetra- mesitylporphyrinatoruthenium(VI), Ru(0)2(tmp), acts as a catalyst for the epoxidation of simple olefins by atmospheric oxygen [I], we have investi- gated the behaviour of steroids bearing a C5-C6 double bond towards aerobic epoxidation in the presence of this ruthenium complex. In a pre- liminary communication [2], we have shown that epoxidation with the Groves-Quinn catalyst is highly (3-stereoselective in the case of 5-cholestene and cholesteryl dimethyl-t-butylsilyl ether, and that, furthermore, it is fS-stereospecific in the case of cholesteryl acetate; however, cholesterol was found to inhibit the catalytic system. In a subsequent investigation [3], we have shown that the epoxidation of a series of 8 cholesteryl esters by air in the presence of a catalytic amount (4-5 mol%) of ruthenium tetramesityl- porphyrin complex leads to high conversion (76 to 94%) and nearly com- plete )3-stereospecificity (>99%). Thus, it appears that the Groves-Quinn catalyst is of considerable synthetic interest, as it provides access to 5^,6j3- epoxides that are difficult to obtain using classical reagents: peracid epoxi- dation, for example, consistently shows a-stereoselectivity, and this is usually accounted for by shielding of the (3-side of the steroid by the two angular methyl groups [4]. The aim of the present investigation was to establish optimal experi- mental conditions for the efficient use of the ruthenium tetramesityl- 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 30 porphyrin complex as catalyst for the preparative epoxidation of unsatu- rated steroids. We have therefore studied the conversion rate of olefin to epoxide as a function of the substrate :catalyst ratio, the life span of the catalyst, and its sensitivity to deactivating agents such as alcohols. The results of these studies are reported below. Experimental section Materials Cholesterol (Sigma) and cholesteryl acetate (BDH) were used as re- ceived after a check of their purity had been made by thin layer chro- matography (TLC). m-Chloroperbenzoic acid (85%, K and K) was used as received. The solvents used (benzene, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate) were of analytical purity (RP Normapur, Prolabo). Carbonylruthenium(II) tetra- mesitylporphyrin [5] was prepared according to a literature procedure [6]. Analytical methods The formation of cholesteryl acetate 5(3,6(3-epoxide was monitored by TLC on silica gel plates (Merck 60F254). After elution with a suitable solvent mixture (ethyl acetate: cyclohexane 10:90), the plates were sprayed with a modified Kagi-Mischer reagent (solution of 0.5 ml of anisaldehyde and 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid in 50 ml of acetic acid), then heated at 125 C for optimal colour formation. The purple colour of the spots is very similar for the starting material and for the epoxide product, allowing a semi-quantitative estimation of the substrate: product ratio to be done visually (average of ratios obtained by two independent observers). 'H and \"C NMR spectra were run with a Bruker AC 200 spectrometer on CDC^ solutions with tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Kinetic measurements Four identical two-necked 10 ml round-bottomed flasks equipped with magnetic stirbars were charged with Ru(CO)(tmp), benzene, m-chloroper- benzoic acid and cholesteryl acetate. The amounts of each reactant, the catalyst: substrate ratio, and the experiment number are indicated in Table 1. Conversion of the substrate was monitored by TLC, as indicated above, TABLE i Catalytic aerobic epoxidation of cholesteryl acetate Entry Catalyst :substrate Ru(CO)(tmp) Cholesteryl mCPBA Benzene molar ratio (nig) acetate (ing) (n1!) 1 1 :12 20 105 8.7 1.5 2 1 :25 20 210 8.7 3 3 1 :50 10 210 4.4 3 4 1 :100 5 210 2.2 3 31 after a period of 0.5, 1, 2.3, 3.5 and 17 h. At this stage, the conversion was complete in flasks No. 1 and 2; flask No. 3 showed completion after ~ 24 h. After two days, flasks 1 - 3 were charged again with the same amounts of cholesteryl acetate, as indicated in Table 1, and the conversion ratio was monitored in a similar fashion for 8 days. Results The results of our kinetic studies on the aerobic epoxidation of cho- lesteryl acetate catalyzed by Ru(0)2(tmp) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, in which the conversion ratio is plotted as a function of time. Figure 1 shows that for a substrate concentration of 0.15 mol 1~1, the epoxidation of cho- lesteryl acetate is complete in 5 h if the catalyst: substrate molar ratio is higher than ca. 1:25. This amounts to an average turnover of ca. 5 h~1. Increasing this ratio by a factor 2 does not improve the reaction rate signi- ficantly. On the other hand, decreasing this ratio to ca. 1:50 does result in a slower reaction rate, the average turnover being only 1 h~1 in that case. When the molar ratio is decreased to ca. 1:100, the reaction rate is very slow, and the catalyst dies after about a day before complete conversion of the substrate can be obtained. Examination of Fig. 1 also reveals an induction period of about 2 h, after which the epoxidation reaction starts briskly in experiments No. 1 and 2. This induction period is also present in experiments No. 3 and 4. The latter shows that under the experimental conditions we have used, a catalyst :substrate molar ratio of 1:100 is too low for an efficient catalytic epoxidation; side reactions leading to deactivation of the catalyst presum- ably compete efficiently with the pathway leading to epoxidation of the substrate. 0 5 10 15 20 ' 40 \"o\"rs Fig. 1.

Curve 1: entry 1; curve 2: entry 2; curve 3: entry 3 (see Table 1). After a first batch of substrate has been epoxidized, the catalyst is still active and can be used for conversion of a second batch, at a much lower reaction rate, however. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows that, after 11 days, complete conversion of a second batch is obtained under the conditions of experiment No. 1, and nearly complete conversion for ex- periment No. 2. The reaction rate levels off after a few days, however, for experiment No. 3, indicating deactivation of the catalyst before complete epoxidation of the second batch. Interestingly enough, the remarkable product selectivity and /3-stereospecificity of this catalytic system [3] are retained throughout all these experiments, as indicated by TLC and 'H NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixtures [3]. The side reactions that can lead to deactivation of the catalyst have been investigated by the following simple experiments. Let us recall first that cholesterol inhibits the Ru(0)2(tmp)/02 catalytic system, presumably due to the presence of its OH group. We have therefore checked the effect of added ethanol, at a concentration similar to that of the substrate, under the conditions of experiment No. 2. Not unexpectedly, we have found that this inhibits the catalyst, as only about 5% of the substrate is converted to epoxide. Similarly, our attempt to epoxidize at 1:1 mixture of cholesterol and cholesteryl acetate, under conditions analogous to experiment No. 2, resulted in the formation of about 5% cholesterol epoxide and only a trace of cholesteryl acetate epoxide. This suggests that cholesterol acts like a 'suicide substrate' which is converted to epoxide by the ruthenium catalyst, but at the same time inactivates it, and prevents epoxidation of the com- peting substrate. It is likely that this inactivation occurs by proton transfer from the weakly acidic alcohol function to the basic oxo ligands of the catalyst, thereby preventing oxygen atom transfer to the substrate. 33 We infer from the above results that protic impurities present in the solvent, as well as hydroxylic species formed in small amounts by catalytic pathways concurrent with the main epoxidation process, may be responsible for the gradual inactivation of the Ru(0)2(tmp)/02 catalytic system. Conclusion The crude kinetic experiments reported in this paper indicate that, after an induction period of about 2 h, the rate of epoxidation of cholesteryl acetate by air is roughly proportional to the initial concentration of the Ru(0)2(tmp) catalyst. Working with a value of the catalyst rsubstrate molar ratio of about 1:25 leads to an efficient, rather fast, and stereospecific conversion to epoxide. Gradual inactivation of the catalytic system, presum- ably due to the formation of minute amounts of hydroxylic species, is observed during epoxidation of the second batch of substrate.
