The sizes of the metal nanoparticles were from 26 to 4 nm, which became smaller as the Co/Ni molar ratio increased. The catalytic activities for the selective hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene to o-chloroaniline were tested. The conversion of o-chloronitrobenzene over the bimetallic Co-Ni/C catalysts was increased by up to 200% compared with that over a mono-metallic Co/C catalyst, which was due to a synergistic interaction between the Co and Ni species. Hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption results showed that new active sites were formed in the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst due to the formation of a Co-Ni alloy, which gave the improved activity of the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst. Key words: cobalt; nickel; carbon nanomaterials; bimetallic catalyst; synergistic effect; o-chloronitrobenzene; hydrogenation The design and synthesis of functional bimetallic alloys are of great interest because their structures and properties can be tuned by adjusting the elemental clusters [1,2]. Bimetallic alloys have been widely tested as catalysts in reactions such as selective hydrogenation [3], oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [4], alcohol oxidation [5], and ammonia oxidation [6] with exciting and promising results, and strategies have been in- troduced for fabricating bimetallic alloys with tuned structures and properties. A bimetallic alloy can have its properties tuned via two effects, namely, the electronic or ligand effect [7] and the geometric or ensemble effect [8]. The electronic effect results from the formation of heteroatom bonds that change the electronic environment of the metal surface. The geometric effect results from incorporating atoms with different activities on a bimetallic surface that not only gives strain effects but also reduces the number of available multiple adsorption sites. As such, the chemisorption and reaction properties of bimetallic catalysts can be effectively modified [2,9,10]. In most cases, this is due to combined ensemble and electronic effects [11]. Carbon materials have been widely used as supports for making highly active bimetallic catalysts [12ï€­15]. Some work on carbon-supported Co-Ni bimetallic catalysts with much more remarkable catalytic activities than monometallic Co or Ni catalysts have been reported [16ï€­20]. The catalytic activi- ties of the Co-Ni bimetallic catalysts are closely related to their structure and chemical compositions, and these can be con- trolled to some degree by changing the parameters in the preparation process [21]. It is noteworthy that nanomaterials with 3D flower-like structures have better catalytic, electro- chemical, and magnetic properties, which is due to to the highly anisotropic shape of the plate-like subunits and open structures [22ï€­25]. Our previous work has shown that flower-like Co/C nano- catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic properties for the selec- tive hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) to o-chloroaniline (o-CAN), which was due to the unique struc- tures and high dispersion of Co nanoparticles [25]. Here, we report the one-pot synthesis of 3D flower-like Co-Ni/C bi- metallic catalysts in an improved hydrothermal/solvothermal process. The Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts showed high activi- ties for the hydrogenation of o-CNB to o-CAN, which was due to a synergistic effect between the Co and Ni species in the alloys and the high dispersion of the Co-Ni alloys on the carbon substrate. XIE Yaling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1883â€“1888 1 Experimental 1.1 Catalyst preparation The precursors of the Co-Ni/C catalysts with different Co/Ni molar ratios were prepared by an improved hydrothermal/solvothermal method [25]. For a typical run, 64 ml of a mixture of deionized water and ethylene glycol (v/v = 1:1) was mixed with Co(CH 3 COO) 2 Â·4H 2 O and Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 Â·4H 2 O with a total metal amount of 2.4 mmol. Furfural (1 ml) was also added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature (r.t.) before it was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and kept in an oven at 453 K for 15 h, and then cooled down to r.t. naturally. The solid product was collected and washed with deionized water and absolute alcohol several times to remove inorganic ions and other impurities, and then dried at 353 K for 3 h. The samples were heated in a quartz tube to 973 K at a rate of 2 K/min and held at 973 K for 3 h in flowing N 2 to yield the final Co-Ni/C catalysts. 1.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Co-Ni/C catalysts were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX 2400 diffractometer (Cu K Î± X-ray source operated at 40 kV and 50 mA). N 2 ad- sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micromer- itics ASAP 2020 instrument. The morphology of the Co-Ni/C catalysts was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, KYKY-2800B) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai G2 20). H 2 temperature-programmed desorption (H 2 -TPD) measurements were conducted on a Quantachrome Autosorb instrument. Prior to the measurement, 50 mg of the catalyst was treated at 753 K in a flowing mixture of H 2 /Ar (10:90 v/v) for 30 min. This was then cooled to 323 K before switching to a pure Ar flow of 25 ml/min. The tem- perature was increased at a rate of 10 K/min to 973 K. The desorbed H 2 was measured by a thermal conductivity detector. 1.3 Hydrogenation of o-CNB Selective hydrogenation of o-CNB was conducted at 413 K and 2.0 MPa H 2 pressure in a 100 ml Parr autoclave. The catalysts were used without any pretreatment. Typically, the autoclave was charged with 0.05 g of Co-Ni/C catalyst, 1.00 g (about 6.3 mmol) of o-CNB, and 50 ml of absolute alcohol. Before the reaction, the autoclave was flushed four times with H 2 . The hydrogenation products were then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 6890N, SE-54 capillary column, flame ionization detector). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Structure and morphology of the Co-Ni/C catalysts The N 2 adsorption isotherms of the Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts with different Co/Ni molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1. These were typical type IV curves, indicating a mesoporous structure. The Co-Ni/C catalysts have specific surface areas in the range of 329ï€­408 m 2 /g with average pore sizes of 10.6ï€­30.7 nm. These data are summarized in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Co-Ni/C catalysts with different metal compositions. As the Co loading in- creased, the intensity of the diffraction peaks became weaker, implying that the metal particles became smaller. The particle size decreased from 22 to 5 nm according to the Scherrer equation. The diffraction peak positions of the (111) crystal- lographic plane of Co 33 Ni 67 /C, Co 50 Ni 50 /C, and Co 67 Ni 33 /C were 44.47 o , 44.44 o , 44.32 o , respectively, which were between those of Ni 100 /C (44.50 o ) and Co 100 /C (44.23 o ), and these were shifted towards smaller angles with increased Co content. This was consistent with the results of Takanabe et al. [16]. This change was probably due to the incorporation of Co atoms into the Ni crystal lattice and the partial substitution of Ni atoms to form a Co-Ni alloy during the co-reduction-precipitation of Co 2+ and Ni 2+ in the hydrothermal/solvothermal process 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 200 400 600 800 Ni 100 /C Co 33 Ni 67 /C Co 50 Ni 50 /C Co 67 Ni 33 /C V o l u m e a d s o r b e d ( c m 3 / g , S T P ) p/p 0 Co 100 /C Fig. 1.

This would result in the different lattice spacings of the crystal face, and which can be attributed to a geometric effect between the Co and Ni species in the Co-Ni/C bimetallic cata- lyst. Typical SEM images of the Co-Ni/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. These showed that the Co-Ni/C catalysts with different Co/Ni molar ratios were all flower-like microspheres consist- ing of interlaced nanoflakes. The voids between the nanoflakes in the net-like structure were about tens of nanometers. TEM images of the Co-Ni/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. These showed clearly that the metal nanoparticles were highly dispersed in the carbon flakes of the flower-like microspheres. The average metal particle size of the Ni 100 /C, Co 33 Ni 67 /C, C 50 Ni 50 /C, Co 67 Ni 33 /C, and Co 100 /C catalysts measured from the TEM images were 26, 12, 6, 4, and 5 nm, respectively, which is in agreement with the XRD results. The metal nanoparticles became slightly smaller with increasing Co contents in the Co-Ni/C catalysts. This was likely due to an interaction between the Co and Ni species in the formation and growth of the Co-Ni alloys. 2.2 Catalytic activity of the Co-Ni/C catalysts The catalytic activities of the Co-Ni/C catalysts for the se- lective hydrogenation of o-CNB are shown in Table 2. With the increase of Co content, the conversion of o-CNB had a maximum of 99.8% at a Co/Ni molar ratio of 50:50. At this composition, the o-CAN selectivity was 98.0%, which was the highest among the five catalysts. The conversion of o-CNB over the Co 33 Ni 67 /C catalyst was 89.0%, which was a little higher than the 85.0% conversion over the Co 67 Ni 33 /C catalyst. The o-CAN selectivity was 97.0% for the Co 33 Ni 67 /C catalyst, and 95.0% for the Co 67 Ni 33 /C catalyst. For the mono-metallic catalysts, however, the conversion of o-CNB over Ni/C was only 64.0% with a corresponding o-CAN selectivity of 96.0%, and the conversion of o-CNB over the Co/C catalysts was only 47.0% with a o-CAN selectivity of 94.0%. The differences in catalytic activities shown in Table 2 can be attributed to an interaction between the Co and Ni species of the Co-Ni alloys with different Co/Ni molar ratios.

XIE Yaling et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1883â€“1888 and Ni species, equal amounts of Co/C and Ni/C catalysts were mixed mechanically, which was denoted as Co-Ni/C-M. This was tested for o-CNB hydrogenation under identical condi- tions. Over the Co-Ni/C-M catalyst, the conversion of o-CNB was only 48.0%, which was much lower than that of the Co 50 Ni 50 /C alloy catalyst. This further demonstrated a syner- gistic interaction between the Co and Ni species in the Co-Ni/C alloy catalyst that resulted in new active sites with improved hydrogenation activity. To further understand the origin of the active sites and the improved catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts, the Co-Ni/C alloyed catalysts were characterized by H 2 -TPD. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the TPD profiles showed a low tem- perature peak at 350 K that can be attributed to the desorption of H 2 molecules on the surface of the Co-Ni/C catalysts. The peaks at 700 and 850 K were due to the desorption of dissoci- ated H atoms that were strongly chemisorbed on the catalyst surface [23]. Interestingly, for the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst, one new H 2 desorption peak at 486 K appeared in addition to the three peaks above, as can be seen in Fig. 5(c). This was evidenced that new active sites were formed on the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst, and that this resulted in the extra H 2 adsorption and led to the enhanced catalytic activity of the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst. The new active sites could be created by the formation of a Co-Ni alloy with an electron density different from that of the Co and Ni single metals [28], which was the main factor for the improved performance of the Co 50 Ni 50 /C catalyst in the selective hydro- genation of o-CNB. 3 Conclusions Three-dimensional flower-like Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts with tuned Co/Ni molar ratios were prepared using an im- proved hydrothermal/solvothermal process followed by a heat treatment. The Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts obtained were flower-like microspheres composed of interlaced nanoflakes. In comparison with the Co/C or Ni/C mono-metallic catalyst or their mechanical mixture, the bimetallic Co-Ni/C catalysts showed much higher o-CNB conversion and better o-CAN selectivity. This was attributed to the formation of Co/Ni alloys in addition to the tuned size and high dispersion of the alloy metal particles in the carbon matrix and the unique 3D struc- ture. This work demonstrated that the hydrother- mal/solvothermal method provides an alternative, simple yet efficient technique to produce Co-Ni/C bimetallic nanocata- lysts with enhanced catalytic performances.

This was attributed to the formation of Co/Ni alloys in addition to the tuned size and high dispersion of the alloy metal particles in the carbon matrix and the unique 3D struc- ture. This work demonstrated that the hydrother- mal/solvothermal method provides an alternative, simple yet efficient technique to produce Co-Ni/C bimetallic nanocata- lysts with enhanced catalytic performances.

Tel: +86-411-84986024; Fax: +86-411-84986080 Three dimensional flower-like Co-Ni/C bimetallic catalysts composed of interlaced carbon flakes with highly dispersed metal nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal/solvothermal process followed by a heat treatment in flowing N2. The sizes of the metal nanoparticles were from 26 to 4 nm, which became smaller as the Co/Ni molar ratio increased. The catalytic activities for the selective hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene to o-chloroaniline were tested. The conversion of o-chloronitrobenzene over the bimetallic Co-Ni/C catalysts was increased by up to 200% compared with that over a mono-metallic Co/C catalyst, which was due to a synergistic interaction between the Co and Ni species. Hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption results showed that new active sites were formed in the Co50Ni50/C catalyst due to the formation of a Co-Ni alloy, which gave the improved activity of the Co50Ni50/C catalyst. 摘要 采用简单的水热/溶剂热法, 经后续在氮气气氛中的热处理合成了三维花型 Co-Ni/C 双金属催化剂, 它由交织炭片构成, 金属纳米颗粒高度分散其中. 随着 Co/Ni 摩尔比的增加, 金属颗粒的粒径逐渐从 26 nm 减至 4 nm 左右. 将该催化剂用于邻氯硝基苯选择性加氢制备邻氯苯胺反应, 其催化活性最高为单金属催化活性的 2 倍. 这是由于 Co 和 Ni 物种之间存在协同效应. 氢气程序升温脱附结果显示, Co/Ni 合金的生成使得 Co50Ni50/C 催化剂产生了新的催化活性位, 因而其活性显著提高.
