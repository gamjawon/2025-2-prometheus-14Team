Vogt 1, H.W. Kouwenhoven *, R. Prins Laboratorium fiir Technische Chemie. ETH Zentrum, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland Received 1 April 1994: revised 3 October 1994: accepted 3 November 1994 Abstract The Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate, p-tolyl acetate and phenyl benzoate was investigated using the H-form of various zeolites as catalysts. Experiments were carried out in batch reactors at 453 K and for phenyl acetate at several temperatures both in liquid phase and in gas phase in a continuous reactor. Product distribution and catalyst deactivation were strongly dependent on zeolite structure. Deactivation of external acidic sites enhanced the yield of para products and improved the selectivity of catalysts based on ZSM-5 and ZSM-12. Keywords: Deactivation (outer surface): Fries rearrangement: Phcnyl acetate: Phenyl benzoate; p-Tolyl acetate; Zeolites 1. Introduction The Fries rearrangement of aryl esters is generally applied in the manufacture of aromatic ketones, and the p-selective rearrangement of phenyl acetate is for instance a key step in the Hoechst-Celanese process for the manufacture of 4-acetamino- phenol [ 1 ]. In the conventional process Friedel-Crafts catalysts are used such as metal halides or mineral acids like H2SO4 and HF. It has been repeatedly argued that replacement of those conventional catalysts by heterogeneous reusable cata- lysts could potentially solve many waste management problems. Because of their high acidity and shape selectivity use of zeolitic catalysts might offer some advan- tage in this reaction. Earlier studies on the Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate, cf. Scheme 1, over zeolitic catalysts were reported by Pouilloux et al. [2,3] who studied the reaction at 693 K in continuous gas-phase experiments at atmospheric pressure, using several zeolites and alumina. In general the reaction was not selec- * Corresponding author, Fax. ( +41-1 ) 6321162.

Moreover, rapid catalyst deactivation by coke deposition was observed. Further work by the same group at 673 K confirmed the earlier results and it was proposed that under these conditions on HY and H-ZSM-5, the primary reaction of phenyl acetate is a dissociation into phenol and ketene. In a later study this group showed that addition of water or acetic acid [4] led to a somewhat better stability in conversion and a higher selectivity for formation of o- and p-HAP, after initial deactivation the concentration of these components in the product was, however, at best 4-5 tool-%. Assuming that the conversion after deactivation in this work [4] is comparable to that reported in ref. [3], this means a total HAP selectivity of about 25%. Cundy et al. [5] studied the Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate in batch reactors under less drastic conditions at 453 K in the liquid phase. Also in their experiments a low selectivity to o- and p-HAP was found and phenol was the main product. The Fries reaction of phenyl acetate over zeolitic catalysts has been reviewed by Parton et al. [6], who concluded that the relatively high selectivity for p-HAP was due to an intermolecular reaction. Subba Rao et al. [ 7 ] studied the reaction in an atmospheric continuous gas-phase reactor at temperatures between 473 and 673 K using ZSM-5 type catalysts modified by impregnation with Ga, Ni, Pt, Pd, Sm or W. They reported that the optimal temperature was 523 K and that phenol and o-HAP were the main products. The o-HAP/phenol ratio was generally lower than 0.5, only using the Ga-impregnated material it was higher than 1.5. Lassila and Ford [8] have discussed the double Fries rearrangement of diphenyl esters of aromatic dicarboxylic acids over LZY- 82 and some other non-zeolitic solid acids and showed that the polarity of the solvent had a strong influence on the product composition. Hoefnagel and Van Bekkum [9] studied the direct Fries reaction of resorcinol with benzoic acid over a number of acidic catalysts and found that catalysts based on zeolite Beta were most selective and formed no resorcinol dibenzoate. Earlier we have reported [ 10] that in batch reactions at 453 K over H-ZSM-5 catalysts differing in AI content, having a crystallite size < 3 /xm, the activity per A1 site in the Fries reaction of phenyl acetate was independent of the Si/A1 ratio. Moreover, we have shown that under these conditions the intermolecular acylation activity is high and that in the presence of toluene, some 4-methylacetophenone is formed as a byproduct during the zeolite catalyzed Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate. Data on the effects of various solvents on the product composition of the Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate over zeolite Beta in batch reactors at 453 K [ 11 ] show that solvent polarity A. Vogt et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 37-49 39 has a strong effect on the selectivity for phenol, on the molar ratio of o- and p-HAP in the product and on the reaction rate. These data indicate that polar solvents enhance intermolecular reactions. Here we report results obtained in the Fries reaction of phenyl acetate, phenyl benzoate and p-tolyl acetate under various con- ditions and on the effects of some zeolite variables on catalyst performance. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Zeolite Beta, FB2/G; USY, GAF2; Mordenite, PM! and ZSM-5, PZ2 were provided by CU Chemie Uetikon. Zeolite Beta, P5/91 and V1.90 were synthesized according to ref. [ 12], ZSM-12, V8/90 according to ref. [ 13] and Nu-10, DV1 according to refs. [14,15]. Beta V1.90D was dealuminated according to the (NH4)2SiF6 procedure described by Weitkamp et al. [ 16]. Analytical data for all materials used in our experiments are collected in Table 1. The N2 isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000M and after dissolution in an HF/ H2SO4 mixture Na, A1 and Si content of the materials were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a Varian SpectrAA.10 spectrometer. The crystallinity of all samples was inspected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Siemens D 500 diffractometer. The ion-exchange conditions applied in the prepa- ration of the various acidic materials derived from zeolite Beta are given in Table 2; before and after ion-exchange, the samples were calcined at 850 K for 3-4 h. All other H-zeolites were prepared by ion exchange with 1 M HC1 for 1 h at 353 K.

Catalytic experiments Batch reactions with phenyl acetate, phenyl benzoate and p-tolyl acetate were performed under nitrogen at ambient pressure and 453 K in stirred reactors, con- taining 1.5 g freshly calcined (2 h, 773 K) catalyst and 55 mmol substrate. Nitro- benzene (10 ml) was used as a solvent for phenyl benzoate. Continuous liquid-phase experiments with phenyl acetate were carried out in a fixed bed, up- flow reactor at 453 and 523 K. Continuous gas-phase reactions were carried out in the same reactor at 523, 573 and 693 K and ambient pressure. The binder-free catalysts were granulated by compression followed by grinding, the 0.2-0.6 mm fraction was packed into the 8 mm I.D. stainless steel reactor and in situ activated in dry nitrogen at 753 K. In all experiments samples were periodically collected and off-line analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a HP 5890II and a cross- linked methyl silicone column.

Results and discussion 3.1. Continuous gas-phase reactions Continuous gas-phase experiments were carried out at 693 K, using the catalysts described in Table 1. The results in Table 3 confirm the poor performance of zeolitic catalysts as reported by Pouilloux et al. [ 2,3 ]. The main component of the reaction product was phenol, products of the Fries rearrangement proper were minor com- ponents. The p-/o-HAP ratio in the products was generally below 1 and did not vary systematically with the pore size of the zeolites tested here. Apart from the A.

Methylcoumarin and 2- methylchromone were not found in the reaction product. ZSM-5 was most active, and using this material additional experiments were carried out at 573 and 523 K, respectively. Results in Fig. 1 show that at lower temperatures the reaction was more selective, forming much less phenol. Catalyst stability did not improve, however. It appears that gas-phase conditions are too severe for this reaction and that the highly acidic zeolitic catalysts are rapidly deactivated by coke lay down from the unstable reaction products and intermediates. 3.2. Liquid-phase batch reactions Results obtained in the Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate in batch reactions at 453 K are collected in Table 4, catalysts are described in Table 1. The product consisted of the expected components and its composition depended strongly on 42 A.

The quantity of p- and o-HAP is much larger than in the gas-phase experiments and thep/o-HAP ratio decreased with increasing zeolite pore diameter. o-HAP is presumably mainly formed in an intramolecular reaction and p-HAP in an intermolecular reaction, e.g. by transfer of an acyl group from phenyl acetate to an available phenol molecule, and/or by reaction of phenol with an acylium ion or ketene, formed by dissociation of phenyl acetate. Similarly, p-AAP is formed as a result of an intermolecular reaction between two phenyl acetate molecules or by reaction of phenyl acetate with an acylium ion or ketene or by esterification of p- HAP; its concentration curve during an experiment shows that p-AAP is an inter- mediate product. After a reaction time of 24 h, ZSM-5 showed the highest conversion, relatively the lowest formation of phenol and by-products, the highest yield of o- and p-HAP and a clear para selectivity. The low activity and the low p~ o HAP ratio (0.5) obtained with Nu-l0 is presumably due to the narrow pore size of this material making it unaccessible to the reactants. Zeolite Beta was initially very active. It was, however, quickly deactivated, and the product also contained some bisphenol A {2,2-Bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane} and some other non- identified by-products. Bisphenol A is readily formed by condensation of phenol with acetone under the influence of protons. Acetone may be formed by decarbox- ylation of the hydrated form of diketene. The latter is a condensation product of ketene, itself formed by loss of a proton from an acylium ion. Methylcoumarin and 2-methylchromone were not identified in the reaction products. ZSM-12 was much less active than zeolite Beta and also showed strong deactivation. The observed effect of pore diameter on product composition suggests that the reaction is shape selective over ZSM-5 and ZSM-12, favouring formation of para products. As mentioned earlier such an effect was not observed in the continuous gas-phase experiments. In many reactions over zeolitic catalysts active sites on the outer surface of the crystals participate in the reaction and influence product composition. When using reactive feeds gradual formation of polymeric species on the outer surface of a A.

In order to check the effect of outer surface activity in ZSM-5, ZSM- 12 and zeolite Beta, these materials were reacted with triphenyl chlorsilane followed by calcination, as described above. Analogous treatments with alkyl and aryl silanes have been repeatedly reported in the literature, e.g. [ 17] as a means to lower the outer surface activity of acidic zeolitic catalysts. Results in Table 5 show that, according to the N2 adsorption data, treatment of ZSM-5 and ZSM- 12 had very little effect on the zeolite texture. Since under the conditions applied in the reaction with triphenyl chlorsilane hardly any reaction can occur with the inner surface of the zeolites, it appears that with zeolite Beta pore blocking occurs, causing a loss in surface area and pore volume. The treatment which deactivates surface acidic groups had an appreciable effect on catalyst performance of the three zeolites. Activity, p-/o-HAP ratio, yield and selectivity of the surface-deactivated ZSM-5 were somewhat higher than those of the base material. Accordingly we conclude that the rearrangement of phenyl acetate into o-HAP is limited by the constrained environment in the ZSM-5 channels and that polymeric species formed during reaction gradually cover the outer surface of the non-modified ZSM-5 crystals. Also in ZSM-12 outer surface deactivation resulted in a better accessibility of the inner surface due to a lower rate of formation of deposits on the outer surface. Surface deactivated ZSM-12 had an improved performance, being more active and selective and showing a higher p/o HAP ratio than the parent material. Passivated Beta showed an overall catalyst deactivation and no change in product distribution. This is in line with the loss in surface area and micro pore volume of zeolite Beta presumably as a result of partial pore blocking. The formation of polymeric byproducts on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals is most probably due to deposition of degradation products of acetyl ions and ketenes. The reactivity of acetic acid and other aliphatic acids over zeolitic catalysts has been studied by Vervecken et al. [ 18], who reported extensive reactions and rapid catalyst deactivation by deposition of polymeric species and aromatics. More- over, aromatic aldehydes may react further with acylating agents under formation of compounds related to dypnone and benzoylacetone [ 18]. Because of the high 44 A.

Fries rearrangement of phenyl benzoate (R =-phenyl ). rate of formation of phenol over zeolite Beta and ZSM-12, coke precursors are formed at an appreciable rate over these materials. Using samples differing in Si/A1 ratio the effect of this variable on the perform- ance of ZSM-5 and Beta type catalysts in the Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate was investigated in batch reactions at 453 K. For ZSM-5 we have reported earlier that the rate of formation of o-HAP +p-HAP +p-AAP was 0.032 mol/min per A1 atom and independent of the Si/A1 ratio of the ZSM-5 catalysts [ 10]. For zeolite Beta no effect of Si/A1 ratio was observed and the conversion was independent of Si/A1 ratio, which suggests strong diffusional limitation. In order to check this, experiments were done using different amounts of one catalyst and in other experiments various rates of stirring were applied. The results confirmed indeed that in the standard experiments the reaction rate was limited by diffusion effects and that these were not caused by insufficient stirring. In view of the results with ZSM-5 materials and the larger pore size of Beta this result is quite unexpected and we assume that it is due to rapid deactivation of the catalysts and the formation of a diffusional barrier on the catalyst surface. The Fries rearrangement of bulkier substrates than phenyl acetate was tested using phenyl benzoate and p-tolyl acetate (cf. Schemes 2 and 3). Using phenyl benzoate only a low conversion was observed over ZSM-5. Results obtained using H-Beta in Table 6 show that compared to phenyl acetate the reaction is more selective, yields a higher p/o ratio in the product and much less phenol. Benzoic acid is produced together with phenol and the sum of the yields of benzoic acid and p-benzoxybenzophenone approaches the yield of phenol, suggesting that phe- nol is formed by direct dissociation of phenyl benzoate. The benzoyl groups react with water forming benzoic acid, with phenyl benzoate forming p-benzoxybenzo- phenone and with phenol forming o- orp-hydroxybenzophenone. The composition of the reaction product seemed to reach an equilibrium value after 24 h. The value of the 'equilibrium' o/p ratio, 0.7, found here at 453 K is, however, very different from the value of the o/p ratio of 4.9-7.0 obtained by Effenberger and Gutmann OCOCH3 OH OH OH Cti3 CH3 CH3 CH3 ~tolyl acelate 2dI5MeAP 31i6MeAP p Cresol Scheme 3.

We assume that in the channels of zeolite Beta the reaction leading to o-hydroxybenzophenone is con- strained and that intermolecular reactions leading to p-products predominate. The occurrence of a pseudo-equilibrium value after about 18 h is most probably due to catalyst deactivation. Results obtained with p-tolyl acetate using H-Beta in Table 7 show that 2- hydroxy-5-methylacetophenone (2H5MeAP) was the main product. Cresol for- mation was low and 3-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone (3H6MeAP) was a minor component, acetoxymethylacetophenones were not observed. 2H5MeAP is pre- sumably formed in an intramolecular rearrangement and stabilised by hydrogen bridging. The absence of acetoxymethylacetophenones indicates that under the conditions applied here the rate of intermolecular transfer of acetyl groups of p- tolyl acetate is much less than that of phenyl acetate. Comparing the reactions of the three reactants over zeolite Beta FB2/G(A) it appears that the rate of deactivation is highest for phenyl acetate and somewhat lower for phenyl benzoate and p-tolyl acetate. 3.3. Continuous liquid-phase reaction of phenyl acetate As discussed above, the performance of zeolitic catalysts in liquid-phase batch Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate is affected by side reactions of acetylium 46 A.

The conditions of the continuous liquid-phase experiments might improve this aspect because of the shorter contact time between the catalyst and the reaction products. We have tested ZSM-5, surface deactivated ZSM-5 and zeolite Beta in continuous liquid-phase experiments at 453 K and at 5 bar at 523 K. Results in Table 8 and in Fig. 2 show that at 453 K the surface deactivated ZSM-5 material had a very low activity, in fact much lower than expected on the basis of the batch experiments. The strong effect of outer surface deactivation and the low p-/o-HAP ratio in the product indicate that under these conditions the outer surface activity of the zeolite had a relatively large contribution to the overall activity of the catalyst. ZSM-5 and zeolite Beta were initially active, the rate of deactivation was, however, appreciable. In this respect ZSM-5 was somewhat worse than zeolite Beta. Data in Fig. 3 and Table 8 show that at 523 K both activity and rate of deactivation of ZSM- 5 and zeolite Beta were much better than at 473 K, an observation which is rather unexpected since the deactivation rate usually increases with increasing reaction temperature. In Fig. 1 we showed that in continuous gas-phase experiments at 523 K, H-ZSM-5 was largely deactivated after 7 h. In continuous liquid-phase experi- ments at the same temperature and a somewhat lower WHSV, a sample from the same batch of H-ZSM-5 showed a higher selectivity and a lower rate of deactivation. 100 o 80- 0 60- [%] 40- 20- m ............ j .... i -1Lr . , 0 5 10 15 20 25 time [h] Fig. 2.

This improved performance is most probably due to a washing effect which is most effective for removal of deactivating species from the outer surface of the H-ZSM- 5 crystals. Fig. 4 shows that the surface-deactivated ZSM-5 had a surprisingly good performance, being stable over more than 20 h at about 60% conversion and 85% selectivity. On the basis of the very low activity at 453 K of the surface deactivated H-ZSM-5 and the temperature effect observed for the generally rather low p/o- HAP ratios we conclude that in these continuous liquid-phase experiments after the initial decline in activity most of the remaining activity resides on the outer surface of the zeolites. 4. Conclusions At the proper reaction conditions zeolitic catalysts may present a viable alter- native for conventional Friedel-Crafts catalysts in the Fries rearrangement of aro- matic esters such as phenyl acetate. It appears that zeolites act as typical Br#nsted acids in the Fries rearrangement and that the reaction is initiated by protonation of 48 A. Vogt el al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 37-49 the aromatic ester, according to the mechanism proposed by Olah and co-workers [20,21 ]. Comparison of the reactions of phenyl benzoate and phenyl acetate shows that the stability of the acylium ions, which are formed by dissociation of the protonated aromatic esters strongly influences the selectivity of the reaction. Phenyl benzoate reacts over zeolite beta with formation of o-and p-hydroxybenzophenones and as byproducts p-benzoxybenzophenone, benzoic acid and a slight excess of phenol. The acetylium ion, which is formed by dissociation of protonated phenyl acetate may be converted into ketene by loss of its proton, enhancing the formation of side products and polymeric deposits on the catalyst. In batch reactions with phenyl acetate the best performance was obtained over H-ZSM-5 type catalysts, for which the conversion increased linearly with the A1 content. Outer surface deactivation improved the activity and selectivity and showed the reaction to occur mainly in the pores of the ZSM-5 structure, p-Hydroxyacetophenone and p-acetox- yacetophenone were formed by regioselective intermolecular reactions and o- hydroxyacetophenone was also formed by an intramolecular reaction [10]. The former reactions were clearly favoured in the channels of the ZSM-5 structure. Side product formation increased with increasing zeolite pore size, and was also signif- icant on the outer surface of ZSM-5 and ZSM-12. In continuous liquid-phase experiments with phenyl acetate, the catalyst activity of H-ZSM-5 depended mainly on outer surface activity and the rate of deactivation was appreciable. The catalyst deactivation rate could be lowered by deactivating the acidity of the outer surface of the ZSM-5 crystals.

The Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate, p-tolyl acetate and phenyl benzoate was investigated using the H-form of various zeolites as catalysts. Experiments were carried out in batch reactors at 453 K and for phenyl acetate at several temperatures both in liquid phase and in gas phase in a continuous reactor. Product distribution and catalyst deactivation were strongly dependent on zeolite structure. Deactivation of external acidic sites enhanced the yield of para products and improved the selectivity of catalysts based on ZSM-5 and ZSM-12.
