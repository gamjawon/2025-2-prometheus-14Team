The effectiveness of a Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst, which exhibits excellent propane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding, was verified for the dehydrogenation of various lower alkanes. When the dehydrogenation characteristics of C2–C4 alkanes were evaluated under H2S co-feeding, the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a high dehydrogenation activity in all cases. However, a significant degradation tendency of the catalyst was observed when lighter alkanes with smaller carbon numbers were used as the feedstock. The deposition of coke (carbon) and solid sulfur and the reduction of Fe species were identified as the main factors responsible for catalyst degradation. To further evaluate the factors affecting catalyst degradation, the effect of co-feeding H2 with the gas feedstock on the catalyst performance was investigated. The reaction stability improved significantly with the co-feeding of H2 during ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions. This outcome is attributed to the smooth reduction and removal of the carbon accumulated on the catalyst surface, which is the main cause of catalyst degradation. Graphical Abstract Keywords Dehydrogenation H2S co-feeding Lower alkane Fe Catalyst degradation Data Availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 1 Introduction Recently, global efforts have been focused on restricting the use of fossil fuels for energy, resulting in a declining trend in the production of lower olefins derived from crude oil [1]. Lower olefins, crucial raw materials for polymers and synthetic fibers, are in increasing demand worldwide [2–4]. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop technologies that efficiently produce lower olefins from non-petroleum sources [5]. One such approach is the steam cracking of hydrocarbons such as ethane and liquefied petroleum gas. Steam cracking involves the reaction of alkanes and steam at a high temperature to produce olefins, and this process applies to petroleum-derived feedstocks, such as naphtha and gasoline [6]. However, ethylene is the predominant product in the steam cracking of natural gas, and the proportions of C3 and C4 olefins, such as propylene and butadiene, are lower. Considering the high market demand for propylene and butadiene, shifting the product distribution in the steam cracking of natural gas to C3 and C4 olefins is identified as a significant challenge [7–10]. Therefore, the present study is focused on alkane dehydrogenation, a technology for olefin production, for realizing propylene and butadiene as the main components. Alkane dehydrogenation involves the removal of hydrogen atoms from alkanes to generate olefins, and the related reaction can be represented as shown in Eq. (1). (1) CnH2n+2 → CnH2n + H2 When propane is used as the raw material, 1,3-butadiene can be produced via sequential reactions involving 1-butene as the intermediate. This endothermic reaction involving the increase of the number of molecules is conducted at a high temperature and low pressure. Industrial dehydrogenation processes commonly employ metal catalysts such as Cr- and Pt-based catalysts [11–20]. However, these catalysts face challenges regarding their stability and selectivity at high temperatures. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel dehydrogenation catalysts that provide the desired product selectivity and resist degradation. In recent years, several studies have highlighted the exceptional catalytic activities of metal oxides (e.g., vanadium, gallium, tungsten, and indium oxides) and metal phosphides (e.g., iron phosphide) in the dehydrogenation of alkanes with a low carbon number, such as ethane and propane [21–30]. Further, transition metal sulfides, such as iron sulfides, have also garnered attention as catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [31–33]. Metal sulfides are thought to activate the C–H bonds in alkanes without causing C–C bond breakage; this suppresses the side reactions involved in alkane cracking, resulting in highly selective dehydrogenation. However, metal sulfides tend to lose their lattice sulfur (S2−) due to the reducing atmosphere in the reactor, and the loss of S2− from metal sulfides can be compensated by introducing an excess of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which has the unique property of decomposing into H2 and S2− on various metal components, into the reactor [34–36]. In the petrochemical industry, hydrodesulfurization is performed to remove sulfur species from petroleum products, producing a substantial quantity of H2S gas. Traditionally, the so-generated H2S is eliminated using the Claus process (2 H2 S + O2 → 2 S + 2 H2 O) [37]. However, the global sulfur supply is expected to exceed the demand by approximately five million metric tons, which is more than twice the current level of sulfur oversupply [38]. As sulfur is highly reactive and produces acidic products, managing excess sulfur as a chemical waste poses a significant challenge to the petroleum industry. The proactive management of sulfur waste can benefit the oil and gas industry by tapping into large quantities of sulfur and accessing untapped sulfur resources. The effective utilization of H2S is expected to reduce the chemical waste associated with sulfur compounds. Our research group has investigated the impact of co-feeding H2S with the propane feedstock to prevent the loss of S2− from metal sulfide catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation [39,40]. We have also demonstrated the remarkable catalytic performances of silica-supported Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Mn catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation. In particular, an Fe-based catalyst (Fe/SiO2) exhibited a high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity to propylene. Furthermore, we succeeded in enhancing the reactivity of Fe/SiO2 by incorporating noble metal components [41]. The objective of this study was to elucidate the characteristics and mechanisms of alkane dehydrogenation using a metal sulfide catalyst. Although metal sulfides are promising catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, many details regarding the precise reaction mechanism and the role of sulfur in alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by a metal sulfide catalyst remain unclear. Therefore, we developed a SiO2-supported Ru-Fe-based metal sulfide catalyst in this study and evaluated its catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation to analyze degradation mechanisms under H2S co-feeding conditions. In addition, the applicability of the developed catalyst in the dehydrogenation of C2–C4 alkanes was also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation A Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using an impregnation method with 10 wt% Fe loading and a Ru/Fe molar ratio of 0.2. First, the catalyst support, SiO2 (JRC-SIO4), was immersed in distilled water with stirring under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h. Subsequently, a solution of ferric nitrate, the Fe precursor, and a solution of ruthenium nitrate, the Ru precursor, were added, followed by stirring for an additional 2 h. The resulting suspension was heated at 80 °C with stirring to facilitate the evaporation of water, and the slurry was heated up to 500 °C in 50 min in a flow-type furnace and calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. The resultant solid material was pelletized using a hand press and then crushed and sieved to achieve a particle size of 250–500 µm for catalytic performance evaluation. 2.2 Evaluation of the catalytic performance of the Fe-based catalyst A fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the catalytic performance of the prepared Fe-based catalyst. After the catalyst was installed at the center of the reactor tube, the temperature was raised to 600 °C under a helium (He) atmosphere. Then, the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was pre-sulfurized with a mixed gas (H2/H2S/He = 2.5/2.5/45 ml·min−1) at 600 °C for 30 min. The reaction temperature was then set to 550–600 °C under atmospheric pressure, and the alkane gas was flown into the reactor. The composition of the reaction gas is alkane/H2S/He = 2.5/1.25/21.25 ml·min−1 (alkane: C2H6, C3H8, iso-C4H10, n-C4H10). The reaction and product gases were analyzed using a gas chromatography system equipped with a flame ionization detector (columns: VZ-7, TC-BOND Alumina/Na2SO4). 2.3 Characterization 2.3.1 Analysis of carbon and solid sulfur deposition The amounts of carbon and sulfur deposited on the catalysts were measured using an elemental analyzer (Thermo Electron; Flash EA1112). For measurements, the catalyst (1.5 mg) was weighed and wrapped in a dedicated aluminium foil cup, which was then placed in an autosampler. The products of combustion were measured with a TCD detector and were detected in a range of more than 4 digits. In addition, each sample was measured twice and the average of these measurements was used. The C and S contents obtained from multiple measurements (more than twice) on the same catalyst were compared. In cases where the results indicated significant errors, the measurement was repeated. Furthermore, to evaluate the amounts of carbon and sulfur deposited on the catalyst, the relative mass (no units) was used instead of the weight percentage (wt%). To determine the relative mass, the weight of the catalyst after sulfur treatment was set to 1, and the contents of carbon and sulfur deposited on it were calculated accordingly. 2.3.2 Crystal structure analysis of the catalyst The crystal structure of the catalyst was determined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The catalyst was grounded using a mortar and pestle, and the powdered sample was filled into the depression of a glass sample holder to ensure a smooth surface for X-ray irradiation. The crystal structure was identified by comparing the powder XRD pattern with standard powder patterns (JCPDS data) of related materials. 2.3.3 Electronic state analysis of elements The electronic states of the elements on the catalyst surface were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Double-sided carbon tape was applied to the sample holder, and approximately one spatula of the sample was placed on it. Subsequently, the samples were crushed using a spatula to achieve a smooth X-ray irradiation surface. The obtained S 2p and Fe 2p spectra were calibrated with respect to the C 1 s peak at 284.7 eV. 2.3.4 Structural analysis of the carbon deposited on the catalyst The structure of carbon deposited on the catalyst was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The analytical samples were grounded using a mortar and pestle, and the powdered sample was filled into the groove of a glass sample holder to ensure a smooth surface for laser irradiation. 2.3.5 H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests To assess the reducibility of the carbon deposited on the catalyst, H2-TPR was carried out using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). After the alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the catalyst was placed in a fixed-bed atmospheric flow reactor, and the temperature was increased while supplying a hydrogen-containing reducing gas. Argon gas was used as the internal standard. The outlet gas was analyzed using a QMS, and the mass-to-charge ratio of each gas used in the analysis is 20(Ar), 2(H2), and 16(CH4), respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of different alkane species on dehydrogenation To investigate the performance of the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of different alkane species, activity tests were conducted using a series of alkanes, viz., C2H6, C3H8, iso-C4H10, and n-C4H10 as the feedstock. Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) present the conversion and olefin selectivity in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions performed over the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst with H2S co-feeding. In this study, to achieve comparable alkane conversions in all reactions, ethane dehydrogenation was carried out at 650 °C, whereas the dehydrogenation of propane and butane was conducted at 600 °C. The results of the alkane dehydrogenation reactions performed at different temperatures are presented in Fig. S-1 to S-4. As shown in Fig. 1(a), higher alkane conversion was observed in the initial stage of the reaction in all cases. However, the efficiency of ethane dehydrogenation decreased rapidly with time, indicating rapid catalyst deactivation. The reaction stability decreased in the order of n-butane dehydrogenation > iso-butane dehydrogenation > propane dehydrogenation > ethane dehydrogenation, indicating improved stability with an increase in the carbon number of the alkane feedstock. Fig. 1(b) shows the olefin selectivity achieved in different alkane dehydrogenation reactions. A high olefin selectivity of ∼90 % was observed with the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane, whereas n-butane dehydrogenation showed a relatively lower olefin selectivity of ∼60 %. To investigate the factors contributing to the lower olefin selectivity in n-butane dehydrogenation, the product yields from different alkane dehydrogenation reactions were compared. Fig. 1(c) presents the product yield for each alkane dehydrogenation reaction performed with and without the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst (blank test). The product yields were determined at the maximum alkane conversion rate. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the total product yield in the blank test increased with the increasing carbon number of the alkane feedstock, indicating that an alkane with a higher carbon number underwent more significant thermal decomposition in the gas phase. In particular, in the blank test with n-butane as the feedstock, the total yield of by-products, excluding the desired butene products, reached 24.1 %. Moreover, the byproduct yield in the C3 and C4 alkane dehydrogenation reactions were almost equivalent to those in the blank tests. Regarding the contribution of non-catalytic reactions to product formation being too high in the case of C4 alkane, the reaction experiment was conducted using n-C4H10 as the feedstock, which has a significant effect on gas-phase reactions. Fig. S-5 shows the effect of the presence of H2S on the thermal decomposition of n-C4H10 at 525–600℃. Note that the decomposition is accelerated by the presence of H2S at higher temperatures without catalyst compared to the results of thermal decomposition without H2S. This is because H2S splits to H and SH radicals at high temperatures, and these radical species accelerate the decomposition of the raw alkanes. Fig. S-6 shows the effect of changing the H2S concentration on the decomposition at 550°C. The yield of decomposition products increases with increasing H2S concentration. Figs. S-7(a) and 7(b) show the product yields and C4 olefins selectivity in the evaluation at 550°C by changing the catalyst amount, where the molar ratio of H2S/n-C4H10 feed is 1. It can be seen that the yields and selectivity of C4 olefins such as cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, 1-butene, and butadiene increased as W/F increased. The yields of decomposition products do not change significantly, indicating that the effect of decomposition on the catalyst is small. In other words, the dehydrogenation on the catalyst is progressing with high selectivity. These results suggest that secondary reactions, including the thermal decomposition of alkanes, occurred in the gas phase rather than on the catalyst surface. Thus, we confirmed that the thermal decomposition of n-butane in the gas phase proceeded alongside n-butane dehydrogenation, leading to a lower selectivity for butene. 3.2 Carbon deposition after dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding We investigated the factors contributing to the different reaction stabilities of the alkane feedstocks with different carbon numbers by focusing on the contents of carbon and sulfur deposited on the catalyst and the state of the active phase of iron sulfide. First, carbon deposition on the catalyst used in alkane dehydrogenation was examined. Fig. 2 shows the deactivation rate and carbon deposition on the catalyst after alkane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding. It is evident from Fig. 2 that the sequence of the catalyst deactivation rate corresponds to the sequence of the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst. This correlation suggests that carbon deposition is one of the predominant factors contribute to catalyst deactivation. The difference in the amount of carbon deposited depending on the alkane feedstock can be attributed to the ease with which the generated olefins desorb from the catalyst. The ease of olefin desorption from the catalyst surface might follows the order of C4 olefins > propylene > ethylene. Table S-1 shows the adsorption energy of each olefin on FeS (001) surface calculated by DFT calculations. The order of adsorption energy is ethylene > propylene > 1-butene > isobutene; this is consistent with the expected order of desorption energies. Thus, it can be inferred that carbon deposition is suppressed as we increase in the carbon number of the alkane feedstock. Further, to distinguish the carbon deposited on the catalyst in reactions with different alkane species, we investigated the structure of the deposited carbon using Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 3(a) shows the Raman spectra of the catalyst used in the dehydrogenation of different alkanes. Sadezky et al. [42] reported that the spectra originating from carbon appear in the 1000–1800 cm−1 range, and they could be separated into five peaks named as G, D1, D2, D3, and D4 bands. The position and origin of each band are shown in Table S-1. Fig. 3(b) presents the intensity ratios of the D1 to G band (I D1/I G) and the D3 to G band (I D3/I G) obtained from the Raman spectra of the used Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalysts. The I D1/I G ratio serves as an indicator of the proportion of defective structures in the carbon, whereas the I D3/I G ratio is an indicator of the proportion of amorphous carbon. We attempted to distinguish the structures of the carbon deposited on the catalysts used in the hydrogenation of different alkanes by comparing the I D1/I G and I D3/I G ratios calculated from the corresponding Raman spectra. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) revealed no significant differences in the I D1/I G and I D3/I G ratios of the different samples, suggesting that carbon with the same structure was deposited in all alkane dehydrogenation reactions. We therefore speculated that the carbon content, rather than the carbon type, affects the catalytic activity of the metal catalyst. 3.3 Sulfur deposited after dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding The sulfur content of the used catalysts was investigated after the dehydrogenation reaction. Fig. 4(a) shows the deactivation rate and sulfur content of the catalysts after each alkane dehydrogenation reaction. The sulfur content of the catalyst treated with only H2S is also included. Fig. 4(a) shows that the catalyst deactivation rate sequence corresponds to the sulfur content. This result suggests that an increase in the catalyst's sulfur content is another factor contributing to catalyst deactivation. XPS analysis was performed on the catalyst to investigate the state of sulfur species deposited on the catalyst after each alkane dehydrogenation. Fig. 4(b) shows the S 2p spectra of the catalyst after the alkane dehydrogenation. For catalysts with high deactivation rates and higher sulfur contents, such as those from ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the S 2p spectrum is broadened on the high binding energy side. Fig. 4(b) shows two fitted peaks corresponding to S2− and S0, revealing the presence of S0 species derived from S8 and the S2− species derived from the catalyst components, Fe7S8 and RuS2. Based on the amounts of coke and sulfur produced during alkane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding, we infer that the deposition of both carbon and sulfur contributed to catalyst deactivation. However, it is unclear which species contributes more significantly. To investigate whether carbon or solid sulfur deposition contributed more significantly to the deactivation of the catalyst, we monitored the temporal evolution of the contents of carbon and sulfur in the catalyst used in ethane dehydrogenation because the most severe catalyst deterioration was observed in this case. Fig. 5(a) shows the temporal changes in the ethylene yield and the carbon and sulfur contents deposited on the catalyst during ethane dehydrogenation. Carbon deposition was barely observed in the early stages of the reaction, but it began to increase with the deterioration of the reaction outcome. In contrast, the sulfur content gradually increased during both the early and later stages of the reaction. These results indicate that carbon deposition contributes to catalyst deactivation. To investigate the cause of this increase, temporal changes in the crystal structure of the catalyst during ethane dehydrogenation was examined by XRD. 3.4 Catalyst structure and state of the catalyst after alkane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding Fig. 5(b) shows the temporal evolution of the XRD pattern of the catalyst during ethane dehydrogenation. The peak of metallic Ru gradually decreased during the early stages of the reaction when the sulfur content was increased. In addition, no Ru metal peaks were observed after 95 min of the reaction. This result suggests that the increase in the sulfur content in the early stages of the reaction is due to the sulfidation of Ru0. We considered the reaction mechanism of dehydrrogenation with co-feeding H2S, as follows; oxidative dehydrogenation (CnH2n+2+S2-→CnH2n+H2S+VS (sulfur defect)+2e-) proceeds by S2- in the lattice, which withdraws hydrogen from the alkane and the consumed lattice S2- is regenerated by H2S in the system (H2S+VS+2e-→H2+S2-). It is noted that the role of Ru is examined in the subject of propane dehydrogenation. Fig. S-8 shows the performance evaluation results of Fe/SiO2, Ru/SiO2, and Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalysts. compared to Fe/SiO2 catalyst, the Fe-based catalyst with Ru component showed higher propane conversion and better propylene selectivity. In contrast, the Ru/SiO2 catalyst exhibited significantly lower activity and selectivity, suggesting that the improved dehydrogenation performance of the Ru-doped Fe catalyst is due to the favorable interaction of Fe and Ru. Based on this data, we consider that the active metal species is Fe and Ru acts as an auxiliary catalyst, which improves the dehydrogenation performance by enhancing the redox functionality of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the increase in the sulfur content in the later stages of the reaction is possibly because the H2S decomposition (sulfidation) rate exceeds the alkane dehydrogenation rate. However, the coexisting H2S regenerates the lattice sulfur species of the Fe-based catalysts consumed by the dehydrogenation reaction in the later stages of the reaction with low ethane conversion rates; the slow dehydrogenation reaction results in H2S not being consumed for lattice sulfur regeneration. Consequently, solid sulfur resulting from H2S decomposition is presumed to be deposited on the catalyst. Thus, solid sulfur is deposited only under a lower conversion rate, and carbon deposition contributes more significantly to catalyst deactivation than solid sulfur deposition. Although, solid sulfur (S0) is well known to be an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation systems [43], there is little relationship between sulfur content and catalytic activity. In other words, this S0 species is not expected to function under the conditions of this reaction. Oxidative dehydrogenation by solid sulphur is less likely to proceed on SiO2 supports [44]. It was considered that the SiO2 support used in this study did not confirm the effect of increased activity, although S0 species were identified on the catalyst. The state of the active Fe7S8 species in the catalyst after each alkane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated using XPS. Fig. 6 shows the Fe 2p3/2 spectra of the catalysts after the dehydrogenation of different alkanes. The spectral peaks shifted to the low-energy side, especially for the catalysts used in the dehydrogenation of alkanes with fewer carbon atoms. This result indicates that the Fe species in Fe7S8 were reduced to a greater extent in the catalysts deteriorated more substantially. The reduction of the Fe species is also a potential factor that contributes to the deterioration of Fe-based catalysts. 3.5 Effect of H2 on dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding To elucidate whether carbon deposition or iron reduction contributes more significantly to catalyst degradation, the effect of H2 co-feeding on the reaction was investigated, particularly for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions, in which catalyst degradation was more prominent. Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) present the time-dependent changes in the ethane and propane conversion, respectively, and the corresponding olefin selectivity (ethylene and propylene selectivity, respectively) in the dehydrogenation reactions conducted with H2 co-feeding. For both cases, the alkane conversion and olefin selectivity without H2 co-feeding are also presented, along with the post-reaction carbon deposition. H2 co-feeding improved the reaction stability in both cases, and the catalyst maintained its activity for up to 50 h in propane dehydrogenation. However, in both reactions, the initial alkane conversion rate was decreased when H2 was co-fed, suggesting that H2 reduced the Fe species. In the long-term performance evaluation, the ethane conversion under H2 co-feeding outperformed that without the co-fed H2, and the ethane conversion rate under H2 co-feeding surpassed that observed for the reaction without H2 co-feeding at ∼3 h for an H2/C2H6 ratio of 0.5 and at ∼5 h for an H2/C2H6 ratio of 1. These results suggest that H2 co-feeding substantially affects the long-term performance of the catalyst. Post-reaction carbon deposition was significantly mitigated when H2 was introduced into the reactor, indicating that H2 co-feeding suppressed carbon deposition on the catalyst. The factors contributing to the suppression of carbon deposition under H2 co-feeding were further investigated. Two potential factors were considered: the reductive removal of the deposited carbon (C + 2 H2 → CH4) and the inhibition of carbon deposition reactions. To explore these speculations, the used catalysts were analysed using H2-TPR, and the reduction properties of the deposited carbon and structural differences in the carbon deposited with or without H2 co-feeding were investigated. The reducibility of the deposited carbon was also evaluated. Fig. 8 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the catalysts recovered after the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. For comparison, the catalyzed reactions were also performed without H2 co-feeding. As shown in Fig. 8, methane generation was observed at ∼350 and 900 °C in both ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions. This result suggests the reductive removal of the carbon deposited on the catalyst surface. The fact that methane was generated at temperatures lower than the reaction temperature indicates that carbon reduced at 350 °C is less likely to deposit on the catalyst. Thus, H2 co-feeding resulted in lower carbon deposition, contributing to improved reaction stability. The structural differences between the carbon species deposited in the presence and absence of co-fed H2 were also investigated. Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) present the Raman spectra of the catalysts after ethane and propane dehydrogenation with H2 co-feeding, respectively, along with the I D3/I G ratios obtained from the Raman spectra. In both cases, the I D3/I G ratio decreased with H2 co-feeding, indicating that the formation of amorphous carbon was suppressed. These results suggest that H2 co-feeding promotes the removal of carbon deposits. Another effect is the inhibition of carbon deposition reactions. H2 co-feeding reduced the oxidation state of the Fe species, the active sites of the reaction, thereby promoting the desorption of the generated olefins and suppressing the progression of carbon deposition reactions. An increase in the electron density of the active sites, such as Pt in Pt-based catalysts, enhances the desorption of the generated olefins. In the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst, the partially reduced Fe species likely promoted the desorption of the generated olefins, thereby inhibiting the progression of carbon deposition reactions. 4 Conclusions We examined the performance of the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of various light alkanes (C2–C4) under H2S co-feeding. Although the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated a higher dehydrogenation activity in all alkane dehydrogenation reactions, a noticeable degradation trend of the catalyst was observed when alkanes with lower carbon numbers were used as the feedstock. To identify the factors contributing to catalyst degradation, we investigated the effect of H2 addition to the feed gas. The co-supply of H2 significantly improved the stability of the Ru-Fe/SiO2-catalysed dehydrogenation reactions of ethane and propane. This improvement is attributed to the smooth reduction and removal of the carbon accumulated on the catalyst surface, which is the primary cause of the performance deterioration of the catalyst. Considering that carbon accumulation is a major contributor to catalyst degradation, the removal of carbon formed during the reaction, particularly at low temperatures, is crucial for mitigating catalyst deactivation.

        "dc:description": "The effectiveness of a Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst, which exhibits excellent propane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding, was verified for the dehydrogenation of various lower alkanes. When the dehydrogenation characteristics of C2–C4 alkanes were evaluated under H2S co-feeding, the Ru-Fe/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a high dehydrogenation activity in all cases. However, a significant degradation tendency of the catalyst was observed when lighter alkanes with smaller carbon numbers were used as the feedstock. The deposition of coke (carbon) and solid sulfur and the reduction of Fe species were identified as the main factors responsible for catalyst degradation. To further evaluate the factors affecting catalyst degradation, the effect of co-feeding H2 with the gas feedstock on the catalyst performance was investigated. The reaction stability improved significantly with the co-feeding of H2 during ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions. This outcome is attributed to the smooth reduction and removal of the carbon accumulated on the catalyst surface, which is the main cause of catalyst degradation.",
