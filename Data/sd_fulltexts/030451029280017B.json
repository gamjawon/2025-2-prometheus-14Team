Lapidus, A. Krylova N. D. Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leninskii Prospect 47, Moscow (Russia) J. Rathousky*, A. Zukal and M. JanMIkova J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Dolej9kova 3, 182 23 Prague 8 (Czechoslovakia) (Received December 26, 1990; revised September 5, 1991) Abstract The catalyst under study was prepared by kneading a physical mixture of precipitated cobalt hydroxycarbonate, magnesia and NaZSM-5 with water as a binder. This mixture was pretreated by drying at 120 C or by calcination at 450 C. Adsorption measurements revealed that NOM-5 was not affected by the solid state reaction with cobalt component and magnesia. When the catalyst was reduced, the metallic phase originated from different precursors depending on the thermal pretreatment. The composition of the unreduced part of the oxidic cobalt was also affected; after reduction, the surface of the dried sample contained both CO(II) and Co(III) in the ratio of 1.8 to 1.0, while that of the calcined sample consisted mostly of Co(III). Carbon monoxide was adsorbed in several forms, but only the most weakly bonded form desorbed without decomposition. Pretreatment by calcination caused a shift in the optimum synthesis temperature and a very marked decrease in the C5' fraction yield compared with the dried sample. The addition of nitrogen to the syngas caused an increase in the liquid hydrocarbon selectivity, while carbon dioxide, especially at higher concentrations, decreased the hydrocarbon yield substantially. The effect of reaction pressure depended on the feed gas composition. Introduction The prospects for hydrocarbon synthesis from gaseous mixtures containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen are determined mainly by the economic advantages of the particular sources of raw materials [ 1, 21. Recently, products of biomass gasification consisting mainly of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen have gained increasing attention as a potential source of liquid hydrocarbons [3]. The development of an active and selective catalyst for hydrocarbon synthesis from the products of biomass gasification represents a very important problem whose solution will determine this industrial utilization of biomass. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 0 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 184 Bifunctional catalysts based on the combination of a Fischer-Tropsch component and a shape-selective zeolite seem to be especially promising for the conversion of synthesis gas mixtures to liquid hydrocarbons [4]. As the Fischer-Tropsch component, cobalt can be successfully used. Essentially two methods are used for the preparation of the catalyst. First, the impregnation of the zeolite ZSM-5 with an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate or with a cobalt organometallic compound [5-10]; second, the physical mixing of the precipitated or impregnated cobalt component with the ZSM-5 zeolite [3, 7, 8, 11-20]. Cobaltosilicalite molecular sieves in which cobalt is incorporated in the zeolite framework might also constitute catalyst precursors with unusual catalytic properties [21 ]. The regeneration of bifunctional catalysts, which represents an interesting and important problem, has also been studied, e.g. by successive oxidative and reductive cycles [22]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the pretreatment conditions on the catalytic properties of a multi-component cobalt-zeolite catalyst prepared by physical mixing, and the effects of the feed gas composition, especially of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, on hydrocarbon synthesis. The conditions of catalytic experiments (space velocity, temperature) were chosen in accord with the typical process conditions for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis over cobalt catalysts at atmospheric or medium pressures [ 1 ]. The Si02/AI203 ratio of the zeolitic component and the concentration of the promoter (magnesia) of the catalyst studied in this communication were optimized with respect to the hydrocarbon yield. It was found that the total hydrocarbon yield and the selectivity of liquid hydrocarbon production decreased with the increasing zeolite ratio. In the following communication, the effects of the ratio of the zeolitic component and of the promoter on the catalyst surface composition, its reducibility, the adsorption of carbon monoxide and its catalytic properties in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis will be presented. Experimental Preparation of the catalyst The catalyst was prepared by kneading a physical mixture of precipitated cobalt hydroxycarbonate, magnesia and the sodium form of ZSM-5 (Si02/ A12O3 = 38) with water as a binder. The catalyst contained 32 wt.% Co and 3 wt.% MgO, the rest being the ZSM-5 zeolite. The ZSM-5 zeolite used was pretreated by calcination at 540 C in a stream of air. Catalyst samples were pretreated either by drying at 120 C or by calcination in a stream of air at 450 C for 5 h. Catalysis Catalytic measurements were performed in a continuous-flow integral fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure at a space velocity of 100 185 h-'. Before catalytic measurements, all samples were reduced in situ in a stream of hydrogen at 450 C for 5 h at a space velocity of 100 h-'. Product analysis was performed after catalyst activity attained a constant value ( - 60 h). Characterization Adsorption measurements Adsorption isotherms of cyclopentane were measured with an Accusorb 2100 E instrument. Each sample was outgassed for 30-40 h at 350 C until a pressure of ca. 10-' Pa was attained. After that, the adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 20 C. XPS analysis XPS experiments were done on a ES-200 B spectrometer. Monochromatic Al K. X-rays of E =1486.6 eV were used to excite the photoelectrons. The Cls line of adsorbed hydrocarbons from the diffusion pump oil at 285 eV was used as reference. The degree of cobalt reduction was determined by deconvolution of the Co 2p3t2 peak. In order to investigate the state of cobalt, the samples were subjected to various treatments in a continuous flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and were transferred to the spectrometer avoiding contact with air. Temperature -programmed reduction TPR pronles were measured by the continuous flow technique with a thermal conductivity detector. A gas mixture of 6.56 vo1.O HZ/Ar (flow rate 3 ml s-') was passed over the oxidic samples (35 mg) in a quartz reactor tube, the linear temperature increase being 24 K min-'. Thermal analysis To gain information about the thermal decomposition of the multicomponent catalyst, various samples were studied by simultaneous TG, DTG and DTA. The thermoanalytical tests were carried out using a Netzsch STA 409/ 429-403 Simultaneous Thermal Analyser with a coupled quadrupole mass spectrometer in a dynamic atmosphere of argon or 10% HZ/N2. The sample temperature was increased linearly from room temperature to 1 200 C. Sample weight and heating rate were 50 mg and 10 K min-', respectively. Carbon monoxide adsorption The total amount of chemisorbed CO was determined by the pulse chromatographic method at room temperature, following reduction of the sample in hydrogen at 450 C. Carbon monoxide was adsorbed by injecting 0.24 ml pulses into the helium carrier gas flowing through the catalyst bed. Temperature-programmed desorption was carried out by heating the catalyst in the stream of helium carrier gas from 20 to 700 C at the rate of 30 K min-'. The desorbed species were detected with a TCD. TPD of carbon monoxide was also studied under vacuum conditions. To this end, after reducing the catalyst in hydrogen at 450 C and evacuating 186 it at 450 C until a pressure of 10-Z Pa was attained, carbon monoxide was adsorbed at 20 C and 200 C. Thermodesorption was carried out from 20 to 600 C at a temperature increase rate of 4 K min', while detecting the desorbed species with a mass spectrometer. Results and discussion Adsorption measurts The adsorption isotherms of cyclopentane on the calcined catalyst and on ZSM-5 zeolite are shown in Fig. 1. The pronounced hysteresis loop in the isotherm on the catalyst may be attributed to interstitial capillary condensation between the particles of cobalt oxides, magnesia and ZSM-5. The isotherm on the ZSM-5 zeolite was used as a reference isotherm for the assessment of the catalyst microporosity, using the method proposed in [23]. The amount adsorbed on the catalyst was plotted against the adsorption on the ZSM-5 (Fig. 1). From this linear plot for az < 1 mmol g-' it is seen that a volume filling of the micropores of the zeolitic component took place. The slope of the linear part exactly corresponds to the content of ZSM-5 in the catalyst. This proved that the adsorption properties of the zeolitic component were preserved and that cobalt was entirely on the exterior of the ZSM-5. This conclusion is in agreement with the fact that the solid state substitution of Na+ for other metal ions does not occur at a noticeable rate when physical mixtures of salts or oxides and the sodium form of the ZSM-5 zeolite are calcined, even at temperatures up to 800 C (e.g. [7, 24, 25]). 3 of o E _E N G V O 2 1 0.25 0.50 0.75 0.5 1.5 PPS CZ lmmol.gl) Fig. 1.

From the photoelectron spectra of the Co 2p3,2 line it was seen that cobalt existed in the dried sample in the divalent state with a binding energy EB = 781 eV. Calcination in air caused decomposition of cobalt hydroxycarbonate and the formation of Co(O oxide in the surface layers (EB = 779.6 eV). After treatment with hydrogen, a peak at EB=778 eV corresponding to metallic cobalt appeared (Table 1). The fraction of the metallic cobalt attained only 30-400. CoO, which was formed in the initial stage of reduction from cobalt hydroxycarbonate in dried samples or Co304 in calcined ones, may interact with MgO creating a solid solution Co.,Mgl_.,O, which makes reduction of cobalt more difficult. The surface composition after reduction of the samples differed depending on their pretreatment - the surface of the dried sample was found to comprise both Co\" and Co\" after reduction, while -that of the one calcined at 450 C contained only the C03+ form (Table 1). Thermal analysis During thermal decomposition of the dried sample in argon (Fig. 2), weight losses took place in several consecutive stages. The distinct DTG and DTA peaks at 300 C corresponded to the decomposition of cobalt hydroxycarbonate. Both water and carbon dioxide were detected in the decomposition products, causing several peaks up to very high temperatures. The most prominent carbon dioxide and water peaks at - 300 C are in agreement with the respective DTG and DTA peaks which characterize the decomposition of cobalt hydroxycarbonate. The relative intensity of the respective carbon dioxide and water peaks changed depending on the temperature.

Simultaneous TG-DTA analysis of dried Co-MgO-ZSM-5 in 10% H2/N2' In the decomposition profile of the dried sample in 10% Hz /Nz atmosphere, the peak accompanying the cobalt hydroxycarbonate decomposition was found at a higher temperature than in the profile measured in inert gas. Hydroxycarbonate decomposition and cobalt reduction were found to occur simultaneously (Mg. 3). 389 Temperature-programmed reduction TPR profiles of the dried and calcined samples are shown in Mg. 4. The low temperature peak with a maximum at 220 C occurring in TPR profiles of both samples may be attributed to the reduction of surface Co2+ cations which are not stabilized by interaction with the support and are consequently easy to reduce. According to the published data [27], the reduction peak with Tm,,x = 320 C in the profile of the calcined sample may be ascribed to the reduction of supported C0304. The high-temperature.peak at 470 C in this profile may characterize the reduction of mixed oxides, e.g. CoxMg, _x0. The shoulder at 320-340 C in the profile of the dried sample very probably originates from COZ evolved during the decomposition of cobalt hydroxycarbonate (cf. Fig. 2). The peak at 370 C may characterize the reduction of cobalt oxides originating from the decomposed hydroxycarbonate. From the comparison of both TPR profiles it clearly follows that the decomposition of unreduced forms differ and that the metallic phase originates from different precursors. Temperature-programmed desorption of carbon monoxide The TPD profile of carbon monoxide from the dried catalyst prereduced at 450 C measured at atmospheric pressure after pulse adsorption at 20 C is shown in Fig. 5. The total amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed at room temperature was 11.7X 10-2 mmol g-I Co. The TPD profile consisted of four bands, with maxima at 200, 360, 390 and 570 C. In order to distinguish among various desorbed species, a vacuum TPD apparatus with mass spectrometric detection was used. After desorption at 20 C, two desorption peaks at T ,,=100 and 200 C were found (Mg. 6). Only the low-temperature peak was found to correspond to CO desorption, while that at the higher temperature was caused by the joint desorption of CO, COZ and also a rather small amount of CH, This means that only the most weakly bound CO desorbed from the surface without decomposition. The joint desorption of CO and COZ at 200 C indicates a dissociative CO 370 470 320 ~i-~ 11 i I 1 1 I 1 / 220 i _~-~_~ a 100 200 300 400 500 600 T ( C) Fig. 4.

According to IR spectroscopic data, the most strongly bonded forms of CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface are bridge forms, which are apparently responsible for the occurrence of the dissociative adsorption of CO. These results support the assumption [28] that for the formation of dissociatively adsorbed CO a certain symmetry of adsorption centres, as well as a substantial heat of adsorption ( > 50 kJ mol-'), are necessary, which is responsible for the corresponding peak in the TPD profile in the temperature region above 300 C. The increase in adsorption temperature from 20 to 200 C caused a considerable increase in the amount of CO adsorbed, as well as in the number of its adsorption forms (Fig. 6b), which indicates the activated character of the adsorption process. At the highest temperature of adsorption, three bands were observed in the TPD spectrum in contrast to the adsorption at room temperature. The first band corresponds to the desorption of CO from the surface, while both bands at higher temperatures were caused by the joint desorption of CO, COZ and a rather small amount of methane. Catalysis The efects of the pretreatment temperature Figure 7 shows the dependence of the total hydrocarbon yield and the hydrocarbon composition in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from carbon monoxide and hydrogen on the synthesis temperature.

The products were mainly gaseous, belonging to the CZ-C4 fraction, while the C5+ fraction yield was very low. The changes in activity and selectivity of hydrocarbon production can be explained by the following mechanism. The increase in pretreatment temperature from 120 to 450 C caused the interactions between cobalt oxides and magnesia to become more intense, which led to the formation of compounds that were difficult to reduce. The resulting decrease in the degree of cobalt reduction and the changes in the composition of the catalyst oxidic component caused the change in catalytic properties. According to XPS data (Table 1), the increase in the pretreatment temperature led to an increase in the valence state of cobalt contained in the oxidic phase. In agreement with the hypothesis on the direct participation of the oxidic component of supported cobalt catalysts in the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons and the action of Co309 suggested in [27, 29; 301, the presence of oxidic cobalt as C0304 m the sample pretreated by calcination is seen to reduce the hydrocarbon yield. Efects of gaseous additives Initially, the effect of a single additive on the hydrocarbon synthesis was investigated (Table 2, Fig. 8). The addition of considerable amounts of COZ or NZ to the syngas caused a marked decrease in the total yield of hydrocarbons in the synthesis products (Fig. 8). However, the effects on the hydrocarbon yield differed when related either to the total inlet gas with additives (Fig. 8a) or to the CO +HZ content in the reaction feed (Fig. 8b). In the latter case, the hydrocarbon yield decreased with increasing concentration of carbon dioxide but was practically unaffected by the concentration TABLE 2 Effects of the addition of nitrogen or carbon dioxide on hydrocarbon production' over Co-MgO-ZSM-5 pretreated by drying at 120 C Feed gas composition (96) Hydrocarbon Composition of C5+ fraction (4b) production CO HZ C02 NZ C, CZ-C4 C5; alkenes n-alkanes i-alkanes (g m-3 of CO+Hz in the feed) 33 67 0 0 20 37 80 8 16 76 27 55 18 0 32 28 57 8 16 76 24 47 29 0 24 28 44 8 23 69 14 27 59 0 12 10 32 7 29 64 28 56 0 16 15 13 90 9 13 78 22 44 0 34 15 14 94 14 20 67 16 32 0 52 17 17 87 13 26 61 'Reaction temperature: 200 'C. 193 Y HC (9.m_3) 120 80 0 N2 00 40 C02 2040 60 (a) CA (%) YHC 19.m_3) 120 0 o N2 0 80 0 40 C02 20 40 60 CA (%) Fig. 8.

Carbon dioxide may be suggested to act as an inhibitor of the reaction, while nitrogen only dilutes the gaseous mixture without changing the total yield. The chain growth factor is also influenced by the feed gas composition. The addition of 18% carbon dioxide caused a decrease from 0.86 to 0.80, while a 16% nitrogen admixture increased its value to 0.90. These variations are in agreement with the respective roles of both additives. Nitrogen causes an increase in the liquid hydrocarbon selectivity, which is in agreement with the fact that the dilution of reagents causes an increase in the chain polymerization rate. A low concentration of carbon dioxide increases the methane yield and selectivity and decreases those of liquid hydrocarbons. At higher C02 concentration, however, the yields of both methane and liquid hydrocarbons decreased substantially. This effect may be explained by a strong adsorption of COZ on the cobalt catalyst surface, which causes the blocking of the centres active mainly for the production of liquid hydrocarbons. The action of the zeolitic component manifests itself in a high proportion of isoalkanes in the C5+ products (Table 2). When both carbon dioxide and nitrogen were present in the feed gas mixture, both additives acted in accordance with their individual functions (Table 3). Under higher pressures, the composition of products, synthesized both from the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and from the gasification products, changed significantly (Table 3). However, the effect of pressure depends on the feed gas composition. When the feed mixture consisted of carbon monoxide and hydrogen only, hydrocarbon yield decreased, due to enhanced production of the side product carbon dioxide. However, when the gasification products were fed into the reactor, the .pressure increase caused a rise in the formation of liquid hydrocarbons. A higher fraction of n-alkanes in liquid products was also observed. It is assumed that the increase in pressure helps to include carbon dioxide in the formation of liquid hydrocarbons. This suggestion was supported by the change in selectivity of the hydrocarbon synthesis on using a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen under pressure (Table 3). When this mixture was converted to hydrocarbons over Co-MgO-ZSM-5 catalysts under atmospheric pressure, the products were mostly gaseous and contained - 789'o methane. At 1.0 MPa, however, more hydrocarbons were formed, with a higher proportion of the liquid ones (n-alkanes of the C5-Clo fraction). Conclusion It was found that the pretreatment of Co-MgO-NaZSM-5 either by drying or by calcination in air at 450 C considerably influenced the synthesis of hydrocarbons over this catalyst. Pretreatment by calcination caused a very marked decrease in the yield of liquid hydrocarbons when compared with the dried sample. The hydrocarbon yield and the chain growth factor were 196 influenced by the addition of nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide to the feed gas, in agreement with the respective roles of both additives. The catalyst whose catalytic properties are presented here was optimized with respect to the hydrocarbon yield. In a subsequent paper, the results of this optimization will be presented.

The catalyst under study was prepared by kneading a physical mixture of precipitated cobalt hydroxycarbonate, magnesia and NaZSM-5 with water as a binder. This mixture was pretreated by drying at 120 °C or by calcination at 450 °C. Adsorption measurements revealed that NaZSM-5 was not affected by the solid state reaction with cobalt component and magnesia. When the catalyst was reduced, the metallic phase originated from different precursors depending on the thermal pretreatment. The composition of the unreduced part of the oxidic cobalt was also affected; after reduction, the surface of the dried sample contained both Co(II) and Co(III) in the ratio of 1.8 to 1.0, while that of the calcined sample consisted mostly of Co(III). Carbon monoxide was adsorbed in several forms, but only the most weakly bonded form desorbed without decomposition. Pretreatment by calcination caused a shift in the optimum synthesis temperature and a very marked decrease in the C5 + fraction yield compared with the dried sample. The addition of nitrogen to the syngas caused an increase in the liquid hydrocarbon selectivity, while carbon dioxide, especially at higher concentrations, decreased the hydrocarbon yield substantially. The effect of reaction pressure depended on the feed gas composition. References 1 C.D. Frohning H. Kölbel M. Ralek W. Rotting F. Schnur H. Schulz J.
