MOLNAR, G. SIROKMAN and M. BARTOK Department of Organic Chemistry, Jozsef Attila University, Szeged (Hungary) (Received June 10, 1982) Summary The heterogeneous catalytic transformations of several 1,3-aminoalco- hols on copper and copper chromite catalysts have been investigated. 1,3- Aminoalcohols obtained by the reduction of Mannich bases were selectively transformed into ketones, while others having either a tertiary hydroxy group or an amino group attached to a tertiary carbon underwent frag- mentation. The mechanisms of these processes are discussed in connection with the molecular structures. 1. Introduction While the liquid-phase reactions of aminoalcohols are well known, comparatively few data are available on their heterogeneous catalytic trans- formations. The literature primarily contains examples of dehydration reactions accompanied by ring closure, generally on oxide catalysts [1 - 6]. Transformations of 1,3-aminoalcohols on heterogeneous catalysts are not known at all. On the other hand, detailed studies have been made of the transformations of certain 1,3-difunctional compounds such as 1,3-diols [7, 8] on copper catalysts and j3-aminoketones under both heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions [9,10]. Typical metal-catalyzed reactions of simple amines and alcohols are the hydrogenolysis of the C N bond [11 -15] and dehydrogenation of the CH OH group (e.g. [16]). In the case of (3-aminoketones, however, the splitting of the C N bond proceeds not by hydrogenolysis, but by elimina- tion [11, 17,18]. The unsaturated ketone thus formed is hydrogenated in the presence of hydrogen, and the end-product of the reaction is a saturated ketone [18]. *Part II. Appl. Catal., submitted for publication. 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 26 On the action of a copper catalyst, 1,3-diols are dehydrogenated, and the resulting (3-hydroxy-oxo compounds undergo either dealdolization or, similar to the (3-aminoketones, elimination [7]. The main reaction product is a saturated oxo compound, but mixtures of complex composition are gen- erally formed, for the reaction is further complicated by the fact that the dehydrogenation may occur with both hydroxy groups. In 1,3-aminoalcohols containing a dialkylamino group, the dehydrogenation can take place only at the CH OH group, and the intermediate ^-aminoketone reacts in a manner analogous to j3-hydroxyketones. As the aminoketone may be hydrogenated to a saturated ketone with good selectivity, it was expected that under identical conditions the reaction of 1,3-aminoalcohols would proceed with higher selectivity than for 1,3-diols. Experimental Aminoalcohols Aminoalcohols 1 [19], 2 [20], 3 [21], 4 [21], 5 [21], 6 [22], 7 [23, 24], 8 [25], 9 [26], 10 [27] and 11 [27] were prepared by Mannich condensation followed by reduction with NaBH4 or LiAlHL^, as described. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 were obtained as diastereomeric mixtures and used without separation. Diethylamine A commercial product of Carlo Erba, of analytical purity, was used. Catalysts CuCr^04 A product prepared by a known method was used [28]. Pretreatment: the catalyst was heated for 30 min at 200 C in a stream of 60 ml H^/min in a microreader, and then for 30 min at 300 C. Cu(CuO)Cr^O^ZnO) Leuna 1930 catalyst, particle size 0.25-0.4 mm, was purchased. Before use, 4 g catalyst was kept in a stream of 60 ml H^/min at 150, 200, 250 and 280 C for 1 h at each temperature. It was then treated with 16 g diethyl- amine at 250 C, at a space velocity of 1 gcomp gca't h 1- Cu The material was prepared from a solution of the tetraamine-copper complex as in [29], the copper oxide precursor being reduced for 12 h at 200 C in a stream of 60 ml H^/min in a microreactor. GC analysis A Chrom 41 instrument (Prague) was employed; 3.6 m 20% DC-QF 1 Kieselguhr column; 85 C; carrier gas nitrogen; flame ionization detector. GC 27 analysis in determination of conversion: 1.2 m 5% DC-QF 1 Kieselguhr column; 140 or 180 C. Reactors Flow reactor The catalyst was placed in a fixed-bed reactor 16 cm long and 2 cm in internal diameter, made from Rasotherm glass. The dead-space of the reactor was filled with glass beads 3 mm in diameter. The reactant was fed into the reactor by means of a syringe driven by an electric clock. The composition of the product was determined by GC analysis of the condensed catalysate. Microreactor impulse technique The reactor, 3 cm long and 0.8 cm internal diameter, made from Raso- therm glass, could be inserted into the gas-chromatograph carrier gas circuit [30]. The reactor temperature was controlled to an accuracy of 0.1 C with a thyristor temperature regulator. The reactant was fed into the reactor via a septum, with a microsyringe. Results and discussion The transformations of the 1,3-aminoalcohols presented in Scheme 1 were investigated on copper-based catalysts; the experimental results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Depending on the molecular structure, three funda- mental reaction types occur: (i) saturated ketones are formed with the same carbon skeleton as that of the starting compound (Table 1, compounds 0 NMe^ .^R^^.

Transformation of 1,3-aminoalcohols to ketones with retention of carbon skeleton (i) A description of the mechanism has recently been published [31], but for the sake of clarity it is necessary to outline the main points again here. A minor correction is also made. Scheme 2 shows the steps in the transformation. In the first step the aminoalcohol is dehydrogenated (iv), being converted to an a,j3-unsaturated ketone, which is then hydrogenated to a saturated ketone in a hydrogen transfer reaction. Evidence for this mechanism is that the intermediates 12 and 13 could be detected in measurements at high space velocities in the flow reactor (Table 1); further, it was also demonstrated that the individual steps do in fact occur on the catalyst. It has been confirmed by isotopic labelling [32, 38] and kinetic measurements [8] that dehydrogenation Scheme 2. Mechanism of transformation of 1, (i). (iv) and hydrogenation (vi) steps are involved in a hydrogen-transfer process. De-amination of the (3-aminoketones and also hydrogenation of the a,(3- unsaturated ketones proceed on both the Leuna 1930 and the copper chrom- ite catalyst; in the presence of hydrogen, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)cyclo- hexanone is transformed to the same end-products as in the case of the corresponding aminoalcohol [39]. De-amination of aminoketone 12 (v) also takes place on the catalyst. Based on our recent results (Table 2, entries 1 - 4), it may be stated that the process occurs mainly on the surface of the catalyst and that it takes place even in the presence of minimal surface acidity. Thus, the role of the earlier-assumed [31] homogeneous thermal de-amination may be a minor one. Transformation of aminoalcohols by splitting of the molecule into two parts; retro-Mannich reaction (ii) Fragmentation (ii) in effect occurs in parallel with process (i). In the cases of 8 and 9, both processes may be observed, but in different propor- tions (Table 1). A common intermediate of these two reactions is the f3- aminoketone formed from the aminoalcohol by dehydrogenation (Scheme 3). The fact that 10 and 11, which cannot be dehydrogenated, are transformed in a different way is indirect evidence for the role of the oxo function in (ii). As a consequence of the essential part played by the oxo group, and of the position of the bond rupture, process (ii) can be regarded as a surface-catalyzed retro-Mannich reaction [33]. This reaction is predomi- nant if the atom is tertiary (Table 1). ^ -2H ^^ \"H A^.V Me;N OH Me;N 0 Me^N 0 9 Scheme 3. Retro-Mannich reaction of 9, (ii). 31 Fragmentation by splitting of the Ci C-i bond (Hi) A mechanism of fragmentation (iii) (Scheme 4) different from that of (ii) is proved by the facts that 10 and 11 cannot be dehydrogenated, that the oxo function in the molecule cannot be transformed, and that a temperature about 80 C higher is required for the attainment of a conversion similar to the case of 9 under identical conditions (Table 2). It must also be taken into consideration that fragmentation cannot be detected in the case of ditertiary diols; instead, dehydration occurs on the copper catalysts [34,35]. Diols which undergo dehydrogenation are converted to |3-hydroxy-oxo com- pounds, with subsequent de-aldolization [33, 34, 38]. It may be concluded from these facts that the type (iii) reaction of 10 and 11 is made possible by the N C H structural unit. 11 Scheme 4. Fragmentation reaction of 11, (iii). The difference in reactivity between 10 and 11 (Table 2) may be inter- preted on the basis of the effect of the methyl substituent on the atom in 11. The methyl group permits dispersion of the charge developing in the transition state, which is similar to the intermediate in the secondary amine- catalyzed de-aldolization of diacetone-alcohol [36,37]. Since it is more difficult to remove the hydrogen atom from the N C H system than from the 0 C H system, it is understandable (see [36, 37]) why 9 is essentially more reactive than 10 and 11. It is also conceivable that the Ci C; bond splits homolytically during the reaction. Interpretation of the differences in reactivity would be possible on the basis of the effects of the structural differences on the stability of the transition state or on the adsorption process, but the available data do not allow an exhaustive analysis. The details of the mechanism are the subject of additional investigations. When the selectivity (S) of transformation of aminoalcohols 1 - 8 is compared with that of the corresponding 1,3-diols, it may be said that the former transformation is in fact more selective, while the transformations of the diols generally proceed by a larger number of routes [9] (e.g. for 1,3- butanediol - butanone, S = 73%; for 2,4-pentanediol - 2-pentanone, S = 54%; and for 2-hydroxymethylcyclohexanol-> 2-methylcyclohexanone, S= 75% [38]. This selective transformation of the aminoalcohols may be 32 utilized for synthetic purposes, for the given type of compound (1-7) can be prepared in good yield by the Mannich reaction, followed by reduction ([11] and references therein). On this basis a procedure has been described for the preparation of ketones from aminoalcohols, i.e. for the a-methyla- tion of ketones [39]. References 1 E. I. Karpeiskaya, V. A. Ferapontov, A. A.

The mechanisms of these processes are discussed in connection with the molecular structures.",
