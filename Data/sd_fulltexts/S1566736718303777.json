College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering Zhengzhou University Zhengzhou 450001 China The sulfonated carbon derived from loofah sponge are prepared and used as catalysts to synthesize ethyl levulinate. Various synthetic and reaction parameters on the catalytic efficiency are comparatively investigated. The acidic density of the resultant catalysts with a satisfactory reusability is as high as 1.59 mmol g−1. The conversion of levulinic acid can reach 91% under the optimized conditions. The results show that the catalysts have great potential to be an environmentally friendly alternative solid acid for the synthesis of ethyl levulinate fuel additive. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords Loofah sponge biomass Sulfonated carbon Solid acid Ethyl levulinate Esterification Fuel additive 1 Introduction As the superior diesel miscible biofuel, ethyl levulinate (EL) can directly use 5 wt% in common diesel engines. Therefore, many researchers have focused on the synthesis of EL by levulinic acid (LA) esterification with ethanol [1,2]. Even so, there are still some issues that obstruct their practical application such as the high cost and low catalytic efficiency. -SO3H-modified carbon is considered to be a potential solid acid catalyst due to the fact that the carbon materials are widely available, cost-effective and easily functionalized. However, most sulfonated carbon catalysts come from pure carbohydrates with high cost. The sulfonated renewable biomass-derived carbon catalysts are most desirable since they are less pollution, low cost, and so on [3]. Loofah is an annual climber of the Cucurbitaceae, and is widely cultivated in the temperate and tropical regions. There are abundant reticular fibers (called loofah sponge) inside its mature dried fruit. The unique microcellular architecture with continuous hollow micro channels forms vascular bundles and yields a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. Till now, loofah sponge-derived carbon has been applied as cell carriers in bioreactors [4], electrode materials for supercapacitors [5], lithium batteries [6], and adsorbents for organic dyes [7] etc. However, the application of sulfonated loofah sponge-derived carbon as catalyst for LA esterification is rarely investigated. In this work, the carbon-based solid acid catalysts are prepared from loofah sponge by a hydrothermal sulfonation method. The effects of various parameters on the catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of EL are systematically investigated. The reusability is also studied to justify their practical applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation The dried loofah sponge was pre‑carbonized at 240 °C for 40 min in a muffle furnace and ground to fine powders (0.01–0.05 mm), following by calcining at 400–900 °C for 2.5 h under N2 atmosphere in a tube furnace, which were denoted as LSAC. The LSAC powders (1 g) were dispersed into 15 mL of sulfuric acid (95%) in a Teflon autoclave (50 mL) and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 24 h, washed with hot DI water (80 °C), followed by drying at 100 °C overnight. 2.2 Characterization The samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Thermo scientific Nicolet 380 spectrometer), X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytcal X'Pert PRO diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU8010 scanning electron microscope), Raman spectra (LabRAM HR Evolution spectrometer), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) (SDT 2960 simultaneous thermo gravimetric analyzer-differential scanning calorimeter, 5 °C min−1, N2 atmosphere), and N2 adsorption-desorption at −196 °C (Micromeritics ASAP 2420-4MP automated surface area and pore size analyzer). The acidic density of the catalysts was determined by the ion-exchange titration method [8]. Briefly, 0.05 g of the catalyst was dispersed into 15 mL of NaCl solution (2 mol L−1) and stirred for 24 h (150 rpm) to reach the exchange equilibrium between H+ and Na+. Then, the solid was filtered and washed with DI water. The filtrate was titrated with NaOH solution (0.01 mol L−1) using phenolphthalein as the indicator. 2.3 Catalysis evaluation LA esterification with ethanol was operated in a three-necked round bottom flask (50 mL) with a water-cooled condenser under stirring (600 rpm). The reaction scheme is illustrated as the following Scheme 1 . In a typical experiment, a mixture of LA (4.0 g) and ethanol with an ethanol-to-LA molar ratio of 5.0 combined with the catalyst with a dosage 5.0 wt% were added into the reactor. After reacting at 80 °C for 10 h, the catalyst was filtered out and then through a rotary evaporation procedure to remove the unreacted ethanol and the produced water. The final products were analyzed by GC2010 II gas chromatograph with naphthalene as the internal standard. LA conversion was calculated using the following Eq. (1), (1) LA conversion % = n 0 − n n 0 × 100 where n 0 and n are the initial amount (4.0 g, 34 mmol) and the final amount of LA after reaction (mmol). To examine the stability of the sulfonated LSAC catalyst, the esterification of LA with ethanol was repeated three times. The catalyst was washed with hot DI water (80 °C) and ethanol, followed by drying at 110 °C for 12 h after each cycle. 3 Results and discussion Unless otherwise specified, the following characterization of the sulfonated LSAC catalyst is referred to the one carbonized at 600 °C for 90 min and sulfonated at 160 °C for 18 h. The presence of the acidic functional groups (-SO3H) in the resultant catalysts is confirmed by the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1A). As for the pre‑carbonized loofah sponge, the band at 1731 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching mode of the COOH group (C=O) and the other one at 1618 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching mode of the aromatic ring (C=C). The absence of the CO vibration peak in the spectrum of LSAC indicates the breaking of the chemical bond, which is the characteristic of the incompletely carbonized carbon materials [9]. As for the sulfonated LSAC, two bands appear at 1050 cm−1 and 1163 cm−1, which are attributed to the vibrational stretching mode of -SO3H groups and O=S=O bonds, respectively. Fig. 1B shows the XRD patterns of LSAC and the sulfonated LSAC catalyst. Two broad diffraction peaks at the 2θ values of about 22o and 40o are attributed to the (002) and (101) planes of amorphous carbon, respectively [10]. Furthermore, in comparison with that of LSAC, the diffraction peak of the catalyst shifts slightly to a higher angle, indicating that the sulfonation promotes the transformation of ordered carbon to disordered graphite structure. The Raman spectra of LSAC and the sulfonated LSAC catalyst are shown in Fig. S1A. Two obvious peaks located at ~1350 and 1580 cm−1 correspond to the D (disordered carbon) and G (graphitic carbon) bands, respectively [11]. The integrated intensity ratio (ID/IG) increases from 0.79 for LSAC to 0.82 for the catalyst, revealing that the resultant solid acid has more defects than LSAC. As a result, the specific surface area of the catalyst is 12.5 m2 g−1, which is larger than that of LSAC (SBET = 5.0 m2 g−1). Fig. S1B presents two weight loss processes in the TGA curve for the sulfonated LSAC catalyst. The first one occurred in the range of 37–207 °C is attributed to the loss of the physical adsorbed water on the catalyst surface. The second one occurred at 207–380 °C is attributed to the removal of the -SO3H groups. Upon further increasing temperature, a slight weight loss continues, which may be attributed to the graphitization of the sample. The survey XPS spectrum of the sulfonated LSAC catalyst shown in Fig. S2a confirms the existence of C, O, N, and S elements. The elements of C and N come from LSAC [5]. S element comes from the sulfonated groups. O element comes from the sulfonated groups and LSAC. The C 1 s spectrum shown in Fig. S2b can be deconvoluted into four components: CC (284.8 eV), CO (286.4 eV), CO (287.4 eV) and O-C=O (289.5 eV) [12]. Fig. S2c shows that the S 2p spectrum decomposes into two peaks at 167.0 eV and 168.9 eV, which are attributed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively [13]. As for the O 1 s spectrum shown in Fig. S2d, there are two peaks appeared at 531.8 eV and 533.1 eV, which are ascribed to S-O-H and SO, respectively [12]. The SEM images shown in Fig. S3a-c reveal that the catalyst possesses the irregular sheet or layer structure. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S3c, there are abundant particles with different sizes and shapes on the surface, which is similar to that of the sulfonated oil-cake waste-derived carbon catalyst [14]. Meanwhile, the EDX element mapping (C, O and S) for the catalyst confirms the uniformly sulfonation of the -SO3H functional groups occurred on the surface of LSAC (Fig. S3d). As shown in Fig. S4a, the acidic density increases from 0.89 to 1.59 mmol g−1 with the carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600 °C. Then, an opposite behavior appears when the temperature is further increased and the density decreases to 0.53 mmol g−1 in the case of 900 °C. When the temperature is too low, the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose in the loofah sponge is incomplete, which is not conducive to the anchoring of sulfonic acid groups. Pyrolysis condensation reaction occurs in the loofah sponge at high carbonization temperature, which forms a network of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon skeleton structure and this is beneficial to the sulfonation of the -SO3H groups. However, if the temperature is too high, the network structure is further enlarged and the carbon content in the carbonized materials gradually increases, leading to a poor sulfonation effect. Fig. S4b indicates that the acidic density increases from 1.23 to 1.59 mmol g−1 with increasing carbonization time from 30 to 90 min. When the carbonization time is further extended, the density has no obvious change. If the carbonization time is short, the degree of carbonization is low, and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure has not been fully formed, which is not favorable for the anchoring of the sulfonic acid groups. When the carbonation time is increased further, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure is formed and the sulfonic acid loading gradually increases. The results confirm that a stable, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structure with favorable sulfonic acid groups can be obtained after carbonization for 90 min. Fig. S4c shows that the acidic density increases with increasing sulfonation temperature and reaches the maximum value at 160 °C (1.59 mmol g−1), and then decreases with further increasing temperature (0.63 mmol g−1 at 200 °C). Low sulfonation temperature is usually associated with a small amount of sulfonate groups anchored on LSAC, resulting in a low reaction rate. However, if the sulfonation temperature is too high, several side reactions such as polysulfonation and sulfone formation are likely to occur, thus reducing the incorporation amount of the sulfonic acid groups. From Fig. S4d, it is suggested that the acidic density of the resultant sulfonated LSAC increases from 1.21 to 1.59 mmol g−1 with the sulfonation time extending from 9 to 18 h. Even so, the density slightly decreases to 1.53 mmol g−1 when the sulfonation time is extended to 24 h because of the aforementioned side reactions. As shown in Fig. S5a, the sulfonated LSAC catalyst carbonized at 600 °C exhibits the highest catalytic activity and the conversion of LA is as high as 88%. While the conversions are only 60% and 53% over the catalysts carbonized at 400 °C and 900 °C, respectively. This is in agreement with that of the acid density. Carbonization time affects the formation of the carbon skeleton, thereby affecting the ability of anchoring sulfonic acid groups. As shown in Fig. S5b, with increasing carbonization time, the conversion of LA increases continuously and reaches the highest value (88%) after 90 min of carbonization. Then, the conversion remains a constant when the carbonization time further increases. Fig. S5c demonstrates that the LA conversion gradually increases from 73% over the catalyst sulfonated at 100 °C to the maximum of 86% over the one sulfonated at 160 °C, and then decreases with further increasing sulfonation temperature. This is also in agreement with that of the acidic density. Fig. S5d shows the LA conversion increases from 71% to the maximum of 88% over the resultant catalysts with the increment of sulfonation time from 9 to 18 h. The LA conversion is then stable with slightly decreasing to 87% over the catalyst sulfonated for 24 h. In addition, several reaction conditions are optimized to further enhance the catalytic performance. The sulfonated LSAC catalyst applied in the following reactions is synthesized under the optimized conditions as mentioned above (carbonization temperature 600 °C, carbonization time 90 min, sulfonation temperature 160 °C and sulfonation time 18 h). Esterification is an endothermic reaction and increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the reaction to proceed in the forward direction to a certain extent. As shown in Fig. 2a, the conversion of LA increases with increasing temperature and reaches up to 86% at 80 °C. With the increase of temperature to 90 °C, the conversion decreases to 84%. This is because excessive temperature exacerbates the volatilization of ethanol, which reduces the effective contact between ethanol and LA and then reduces the esterification efficiency. Fig. 2b clearly shows that the LA conversion increases from 67% to 86% as the molar ratio of ethanol to LA increases from 2.5 to 5.0. However, the conversion shows an opposite trend when the ratio further increases, and the conversion decreases to 72% with the ratio of 15.0. It is due to the fact that the superfluous ethanol dilutes the concentration of LA and occupies too much active sites, and decreases the esterification efficiency [15]. Fig. 2c suggests that the resultant sulfonated carbon catalyst can effectively facilitate LA esterification. The blank one without catalyst only offers 7% of LA conversion. LA conversion increases significantly from 73% to 86% with increasing catalyst dosage from 2.5 to 5.0 wt%. Nevertheless, the esterification efficiency does not obvious increase when the catalyst dosage is further increased. The slightly decrease in esterification efficiency (dosage of 12.5 wt%) may be attributed to the poor mass transfer between the catalyst and LA in the reaction, which exceeds the reaction equilibrium limit. Therefore, the catalyst dosage of 5.0 wt% is chosen for the subsequent study. Fig. 2d exhibits the effect of reaction time towards conversion of LA over the catalyst. The conversion increases from 41% within 2 h to 90% within 10 h. As the reaction time further increases to 12 h, the conversion only increases to 91%. As mentioned above, LA esterification is a reversible reaction. Within a certain time, the esterification reaction tends to be balanced, meaning that the prolonged reaction time does not effectively improve the efficiency. In order to study the reusability of the resultant catalyst, LA esterification cycles are performed under the optimized reaction conditions (ethanol/LA molar ratio of 5.0, 5.0 wt% catalyst dosage, reaction temperature of 80 °C and reaction time of 10 h). The results shown in Fig. S6 reveal that the LA conversion decreases gradually, presumably because of the leaching of -SO3H groups, which is suggested by the FT-IR spectra shown in Fig. S7. The characteristic absorption bands of -SO3H groups at 1050 cm−1 and 1163 cm−1 for the fresh one are stronger than those for the reused catalyst. Even so, LA conversion still reaches up to 56% after four runs, indicating the solid acid catalyst has satisfactory reusability. 4 Conclusions The sulfonated loofah sponge biomass-derived carbon is sucessfully prepared and used as catalyst to synthesize ethyl levulinate. Various parameters are optimized to enhance the catalytic efficiency. The conversion of levulinic acid (LA) is as high as 91% over the sulfonated carbon catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions. In addition, the resultant catalyst possesses satisfactory reusability. Our work provides a successful alternative catalyst for the conventional liquid acid catalyst in the esterification process.
