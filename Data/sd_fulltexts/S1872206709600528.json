DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(09)60052-8 RESEARCH PAPER Synthesis and Characterization of Wormhole-Like Mesoporous SnO 2 with High Surface Area JIANG Haiyan, DAI Hongxing*, XIA Yunsheng, HE Hong Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Environmental and Energy Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China Abstract: High-surface-area wormhole-like mesoporous SnO 2 with a tetragonal rutile-type structure was fabricated adopting the hydro- thermal strategy using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the template, tin chloride as the tin source, and urea as the precipitating agent. The effects of PEG with different molecular weights and its concentration, hydrothermal temperature, and calcination temperature on the pore structure and morphology of SnO 2 were examined. The physical properties of these materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, ni- trogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ultravio- let-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy. It is shown that the PEG template could be removed by washing, no significant impact of PEG molecular weight was observed on the surface area of the mesoporous SnO 2 samples, but the factors such as PEG concentration, hydro- thermal temperature, and calcination temperature exerted considerable influence on the pore structure of the SnO 2 samples. After the hydrothermal treatment at 120 o C for 29 h with the molar ratio of PEG (with a molecular weight of 6000 g/mol) to Sn of 0.01, a worm- hole-like mesoporous SnO 2 sample with a high surface area of 161 m 2 /g and an average pore size of 2.6 nm was generated. The SnO 2 samples exhibited good behavior in UV-light absorption. These porous materials are suitable for use as catalysts, supports, and gas sensors. Key words: hydrothermal synthesis; wormhole-like mesoporous tin dioxide; poly(ethylene glycol); light absorption property Tin dioxide, an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap, is well known for its widespread applications in gas sensors [1] and the anode materials of lithium ion batteries [2] because of its high gas sensitivity and corrosion resistance. SnO 2 is also a good catalyst. It can catalyze the condensation of n-butanol to octanone [3] and the oxidation of carbon monoxide and pro- pane [4]. SnO 2 is also a component in Sn-Sb-O composite materials used to catalyze the selective oxidation of propylene to acrylaldehyde [5]. Furthermore, SnO 2 can also be used as the support to constitute Au/SnO 2 [6], Pt/SnO 2 [7], SO 4 2 /SnO 2 [8], and copper tetrasulfonated phthalocyanine/SnO 2 [9] catalysts for the oxidation of carbon monoxide, hydrogenation of cro- tonaldehyde, alkylation of hydroquinone with tert-butanol, and photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under visible light irradiation, respectively. The specific surface area of a catalyst or support has an important effect on the catalytic activity. Among the SnO 2 catalysts or supports prepared by traditional approaches, most are bulk materials and have low surface area. However, mesoporous SnO 2 has a high surface area and ex- cellent physicochemical properties [10]. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a strategy for the controlled fabrication of high surface area mesoporous SnO 2 . Various methods, such as templating [11 18], sol-gel [19], and precipitation [20], have been reported for the synthesis of mesoporous SnO 2 . Ulagappan et al. [11] synthesized mesoporous SnO 2 using sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosucci- nate as the template, but the mesopore structure was destroyed after the surfactant was removed. By adopting an evaporation- induced self-assembly strategy with SnCl 4 as the tin source and P123 ((EO) 20 (PO) 70 (EO) 20 ) as the template, Yang et al. [12] fabricated mesoporous SnO 2 with a surface area of 180 m 2 /g and an average pore size of 6.8 nm. Using cetyltrimethylam- monium bromide as the template, SnCl 4 as the precursor, and ammonia as the alkaline source and after hydrolysis treatment, JIANG Haiyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 295–301 aging at room temperature, and calcination at 350 o C, mesoporous SnO 2 with a surface area of 343 m 2 /g and an av- erage pore size of 2.4 nm was obtained [13]. However, some surfactant was retained in the mesoporous SnO 2 because of low calcination temperature adopted, which resulted in a poor crystallinity of the products. Although the stability of mesoporous SnO 2 can be improved by treating their precursors with phosphoric acid [21] or doping with other elements (such as Si [22], Zn [23], Sb [24] etc.), these approaches are rather complicated and the products contain impurities. In recent years, the fabrication of SnO 2 nanocrystals using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the surfactant has been reported [25 27]. For example, Shen et al. [26] obtained SnO 2 nanocrystals with an average particle size of 50 nm by a PEG-assisted hydrothermal treatment method. With the aid of PEG and citric acid under hydrothermal conditions, Li et al. [27] fabricated a nanometer SnO 2 with a particle diameter of 6 nm and a surface area of 206 m 2 /g. In this study, we successfully fabricated a wormhole-like mesoporous SnO 2 by adopting a hydrothermal strategy using a cheap and environmentally benign PEG as the template, tin chloride as the inorganic precursor, and urea as the precipitating agent. The effects of molecular weight (MW) and concentra- tion of the PEG, hydrothermal temperature, and calcination temperature on the mesoporosity of the synthesized SnO 2 sample were examined. Such a PEG-templated hydrothermal approach presents a convenient and low cost route to control- lably fabricate high surface area wormhole-like mesoporous SnO 2 materials. 1 EExperimental 1.1 Synthesis of mesoporous SnO 2 PEG with MWs of 4000, 6000, and 10000 was dissolved in deionized water. A proper amount of SnCl 4 �5H 2 O (AR) was added to the above solution. After stirring for 2 h at room temperature (RT), a specific amount of urea was added to the mixed solution, which was then stirred for 0.5 h. The molar ratio of SnCl 4 :PEG:CO(NH 2 ) 2 :H 2 O was 1:(0.01 0.06):2:120. The resultant slurry was transferred into a 100-ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (packed volume = 80 ml). The auto- clave was placed in an oven for hydrothermal processing at 100, 120, and 160 o C for 29 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was filtered, washed with deionized water (until no Cl was detected in the filtrate), and dried at 100 o C for 24 h. The final mesoporous SnO 2 samples were denoted xSP(y)-T 1 , where x, y, and T 1 represent the PEG/Sn molar ratio, MW of PEG, and hydrothermal temperature, respectively. To investigate the thermal stability, the xSP(y)-T 1 samples were calcined in air at 1 o C/min from RT to 350 or 450 o C and kept at the temperature for 2 h. The samples obtained were designated as xSP(y)-T 1 -T 2 , where T 2 is the calcination temperature. 1.2 Characterization of mesoporous SnO 2 The crystal phase composition of the samples was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8) with Cu K . ra- diation at 40 kV and 35 mA. The crystallite size was estimated by the Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum intensity (FWHM) of the (110) plane. Nitrogen adsorp- tion-desorption isotherms were obtained on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The sample was degassed at 200 o C for 5 h prior to the measurements. Specific surface area was cal- culated by the BET method, and pore volume and pore size distribution were estimated by the BJH method. Pore structure and crystal types of the samples were determined by a high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were recorded on a FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27). Ultra- violet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of the samples were measured on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Effect of synthesis conditions on the structure of mesoporous SnO 2 2.1.1 Effect of PEG with different MWs Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the SnO 2 samples syn- thesized with different MWs of PEG.

JIANG Haiyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 295–301 standard pattern of cassiterite (JCPDS No. 41-1445), all of the XRD lines matched well with those of tetragonal rutile-type SnO 2 . The three diffraction peaks at 2 = 26.7°, 33.9°, and 52.0° can be indexed as the (110), (101), and (211) lattice planes, respectively. There was a small variation in the signal intensity for the three samples, which reflected the difference in crystallinity. The broadening of the diffraction peaks indi- cated the presence of small-sized nanocrystalline SnO 2 . A broad and weak diffraction signal at 2 , 2 o was recorded in the small-angle XRD pattern of each sample, which indicated the formation of wormhole-like mesopores. The textural parameters of the synthesized SnO 2 are sum- marized in Table 1. The particle sizes were ca. 4.5 nm. This result indicated that the MW of PEG exerted little influence on the particle size of the SnO 2 samples. Similar results were also reported by Devi et al. [28]. Figure 2 is the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the SnO 2 samples. It is observed that the isotherms of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 and 0.04SP(10000)-120 samples are dis- torted type IV isotherms with a small hysteresis loop in the p/p 0 region of 0.4 0.8. This indicates the presence of wormhole-like mesopores [29,30]. The isotherm of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 sample displayed a narrow hysteresis loop in the p/p 0 range of 0.9 1.0, which indicated the existence of a small amount of macropores that originated from the voids between aggregated SnO 2 nanoparticles. The characteristic isotherm of the 0.04SP(4000)-120 sample (Fig. 2 (1)) suggested the possible existence of mesopores and micropores. The surface area and pore volume of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 and 0.04SP(10000)-120 samples were much higher than those of 0.04SP(4000)-120 (Table 1), which demonstrated that a PEG with a longer CH 2 CH 2 O chain gave SnO 2 with a higher surface area. From the sol-gel synthesis of mesoporous titania, Devi et al. [28] pointed out that the different mesoporosity of TiO 2 was asso- ciated with the difference in the configuration of the ethylene chain in the PEG matrix. Figure 3 shows the TEM images and corresponding SAED pattern of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 and 0.04SP(10000)-120 samples. One can clearly see the wormhole-like mesopores (Fig. 3(a) and (c)), which were formed by the aggregation of uniform nanoparticles. Such a pore structure is similar to that of the tin dioxide samples fabricated by other researchers [23]. Under hydrothermal conditions, Sn 4+ reacted with aqueous ammonia derived from the hydrolysis of urea to generate Sn(OH) 4 or was directly hydrolyzed to D-stannic acid, and the latter was dehydrated to form SnO 2 . PEG can be adsorbed on the surfaces of Sn(OH) 4 ( D-stannic acid) or SnO 2 by weak coordination bonds to form crown-ether-type complex inter- mediates that inhibit the growth of the SnO 2 particles. As a result, uniform SnO 2 nanocrystals were obtained. The ap- pearance of clear multiple diffraction rings in the SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 3(a)) revealed that the SnO 2 sample was poly- crystalline. From the HRTEM image of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 sample (Fig. 3(b)), one can observe clear lattice fringes with the d spacing of the (110) plane of 0.33 nm, which was close to that (0.34 nm) of the tetragonal SnO 2 sample (JCPDS No. 0 40 80 (5) (10) 0 40 80 (4) V o lum e adsorbed (cm 3 /g) (9) 0 40 80 (3) (8) 0 40 80 (2) (7) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0 40 80 (1) p/p 0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (6) p/p 0 Fig. 2.

JIANG Haiyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 295–301 41-1445). To examine the efficiency of template removal, we recorded the FT-IR spectrum of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 sample. This is shown in Fig. 4. There were signals at 3 392 and 1 630 cm 1 assignable to the stretching and bending vibrations of the hy- droxyl group adsorbed on the sample surfaces and signals at 653 and 522 cm 1 attributable to the framework vibrations of SnO 2 [31]. No signals due to the CH 2 and C O bonds of PEG with a MW of 6 000 were detected at 2 874 and 1 099 cm 1 , which indicated that the PEG was completely removed in the step of washing with deionized water. 2.1.2 Effect of PEG concentration To probe the effect of PEG concentration on the pore struc- ture, we fabricated SnO 2 samples using various PEG concen- trations. It can be seen from Fig. 1 (4) that the 0.01SP(6000)- 120 sample possessed a tetragonal rutile-type structure (JCPDS No. 41-1445). The crystallite size was estimated to be 4.2 nm (Table 1). This result indicated that the PEG concentration has no significant effect on the particle size of SnO 2 . With the increase in PEG concentration, however, the XRD peak inten- sity of the fabricated SnO 2 sample was enhanced markedly. This indicated a significant improvement in the crystallinity. Shown in Figs. 2(2), (4), (5), and (6) are the N 2 adsorp- tion-desorption isotherms of the SnO 2 samples fabricated with different PEG concentrations. The 0.01SP(6000)-120 sample displayed an isotherm between type I and type IV, indicating the presence of micropores and mesopores. The 0.02SP(6000)-120, 0.04SP(6000)-120, and 0.06SP(6000)-120 samples exhibited a type IV isotherm, indicating the presence of mesopores. As shown in Table 1, the SnO 2 samples synthe- sized with different PEG concentrations at a hydrothermal temperature not higher than 120 o C possessed high surface area, with the 0.01SP(6000)-120 sample exhibiting the highest surface area of 161 m 2 /g. It can also be observed that the sur- face area of the SnO 2 sample decreased whereas the pore volume and pore size increased with increasing PEG concen- tration. This may result from the decrease in the number of the micelles due to the rise in PEG concentration [32]. From the TEM images (Fig. 5) of the 0.01SP(6000)-120 sample, it can be seen the generation of a wormhole-like mesoporous struc- ture, similar to that of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 sample. 2.1.3 Effect of hydrothermal temperature Figures 1(2), (5), and (6) show the XRD patterns of the SnO 2 samples synthesized at a PEG6000/Sn molar ratio of 0.04 and different hydrothermal temperatures. All of the samples pos- sessed a tetragonal rutile-type structure. The XRD peaks in- creased in intensity with the rise in hydrothermal temperature, indicating the improvement in crystallinity and the increase in particle size. This result is in agreement with the Ostwald ripening mechanism. Based on the Scherrer equation and XRD data, the crystallite size of the 0.04SP(6000)-100, 0.04SP- (6000)-120, and 0.04SP(6000)-160 samples was estimated to be 3.3, 4.6, and 10.3 nm, respectively (Table 1). It can be seen from Figs. 2(2), (7), and (8) that there was a remarkable difference in the N 2 adsorption-desorption iso- therms for the SnO 2 samples synthesized hydrothermally at various temperatures. The 0.04SP(6000)-100 sample showed a typical type I isotherm with the N 2 adsorption capacity rapidly increasing to a saturated value at p/p 0 < 0.2, indicating that this 6 nm (b) d (110) = 0.33 nm (a) 60 nm 30 nm (c) Fig. 3.

FT-IR spectrum of 0.04SP(6000)-120. JIANG Haiyan et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 295–301 material contained micropores. Although the 0.04SP(6000)- 120 and 0.04SP(6000)-160 samples displayed a type IV iso- therm, their hysteresis loops changed from type H2 to type H3, indicative of the structural transition from wormhole-like mesopores to slit-shaped pores [33]. The surface area of 0.04SP(6000)-160 drastically decreased compared with those of 0.04SP(6000)-120 and 0.04SP(6000)-100 (Table 1). This result may be due to the separation of PEG and H 2 O at a hydrothermal temperature of 160 o C [34]. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the 0.04SP(6000)-100 and 0.04SP(6000)-160 samples were polycrystalline. There were wormhole-like mesopores in the former sample whereas the latter sample contained in- traparticle voids formed by the aggregation of bigger nanoparticles. These observations are in good agreement with the XRD and N 2 adsorption results. 2.1.4 Effect of calcination temperature Figures 1(7) and (8) show the XRD patterns of the 0.04PEG(6000)-120 sample after calcination at 350 and 450 o C, respectively. The two samples were also of the tetragonal rutile structure. It is well known that a rise in calcination temperature gives rise to the growth of the crystallites. The particle sizes of 0.04SP(6000)-120-350 and 0.04SP(6000)- 120-450 were calculated to be 6.6 and 9.7 nm, respectively (Table 1), smaller than that of the mesoporous SnO 2 reported in the literature [35]. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the SnO 2 samples after calcination at different temperatures are shown in Figs. 2 (9) and (10). It can be seen that the three samples exhibited distorted type IV isotherms attributable to the formation of an irregular mesoporous structure. With a rise in the calcination temperature from 350 to 450 o C, the surface area decreased from 89 to 56 m 2 /g, and the corresponding average pore size increased from 3.5 to 5.4 nm (Table 1). This was because part of the mesopores disappeared due to the growth of the SnO 2 particles. The increase in particle size of the SnO 2 sample after calcination at a higher temperature was confirmed by the TEM observations (Figs. 7(a) and (c)). Furthermore, the electron diffraction rings were more in number and clearer in brightness for 0.04SP(6000)-120-450 than those for 0.04SP(6000)-120- 350 (insets of Figs. 7(a) and (c)). This was another piece of supporting evidence for the growth of SnO 2 nanocrystallites. The d spacing of the (110) plane of the 350 o C-calcined SnO 2 sample was 0.32 nm, close to the d value (0.34 nm) of the standard SnO 2 sample (JCPDS No. 41-1445). 2.2 UV-Vis absorption behavior UV-Vis spectroscopy is an effective tool to investigate the light absorbing behavior of solid powders. Fig. 8 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 20 nm (b) 50 nm (a) Fig. 5. TEM images of the 0.01SP(6000)-120 sample. 50 nm (c) 20 nm (b) 50 nm (a) Fig. 6.

The two samples pos- sessed strong absorbance in the wavelength range of 200–400 nm, with the calcined sample showing the better absorbance. This was probably due to the increases in crystallite size and surface roughness [36]. Using the method reported by Provenzano et al. [37], the absorption edge values of the 0.04SP(6000)-120 and 0.04SP(6000)-120-350 samples were calculated to be 343 and 383 nm, respectively. These showed that a red shift occurred for the SnO 2 sample after calcination. This may be associated with the increase in particle size [38]. It is worth pointing out that the absorption edge (350 nm) of bulk SnO 2 was between those of the above mesoporous SnO 2 sam- ples. 3 Conclusions Wormhole-like mesoporous SnO 2 with a tetragonal rutile structure was fabricated under hydrothermal conditions using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the template, tin chloride as the metal precursor, and urea as the precipitating agent. The tem- plate can be readily removed by washing with deionized water. This is a novel and convenient approach to fabricate high sur- face area mesoporous metal oxides. Suitable parameters for the synthesis of wormhole-like mesoporous SnO 2 were as follows: PEG molecular weight of 6000, PEG/Sn molar ratio of 0.01, and hydrothermal temperature of 120 o C. Under the optimal conditions, the fabricated mesoporous SnO 2 sample showed a high surface area of 161 m 2 /g and an average pore size of 2.6 nm. After calcination at 450 o C, it still retained a mesoporous structure but its surface area was decreased to 56 m 2 /g. The synthesized SnO 2 samples before and after calcination exhib- ited good absorbance behavior in the UV light region. A red shift was observed for the SnO 2 sample after calcination.

Tel: +86-10-67396588; Fax: +86-10-67391983 High-surface-area wormhole-like mesoporous SnO2 with a tetragonal rutile-type structure was fabricated adopting the hydrothermal strategy using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the template, tin chloride as the tin source, and urea as the precipitating agent. The effects of PEG with different molecular weights and its concentration, hydrothermal temperature, and calcination temperature on the pore structure and morphology of SnO2 were examined. The physical properties of these materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy. It is shown that the PEG template could be removed by washing, no significant impact of PEG molecular weight was observed on the surface area of the mesoporous SnO2 samples, but the factors such as PEG concentration, hydrothermal temperature, and calcination temperature exerted considerable influence on the pore structure of the SnO2 samples. After the hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 29 h with the molar ratio of PEG (with a molecular weight of 6000 g/mol) to Sn of 0.01, a wormhole-like mesoporous SnO2 sample with a high surface area of 161 m2/g and an average pore size of 2.6 nm was generated. The SnO2 samples exhibited good behavior in UV-light absorption. These porous materials are suitable for use as catalysts, supports, and gas sensors. 摘要 以聚乙二醇䜕(PEG)䜕为模板剂,䜕氯化锡为锡源,䜕尿素为沉淀剂,䜕采用水热法合成出高比表面积的蠕虫状介孔四方相金红石型䜕SnO2.䜕䜕考察了䜕PEG䜕分子量及其浓度、水热温度和焙烧温度对䜕SnO2䜕孔结构和形貌的影响.䜕䜕采用䜕X䜕射线衍射、N2䜕吸附-脱附、透射电镜、红外光谱和紫外-可见光谱等技术对样品进行了表征.䜕䜕结果表明,䜕模板剂可被水洗除去,䜕PEG䜕分子量对介孔䜕SnO2䜕的比表面积影响不大,䜕而䜕PEG䜕浓度、水热温度和焙烧温度的影响较大.䜕䜕在以分子量为䜕6000䜕的䜕PEG䜕与䜕Sn䜕的摩尔比为䜕0.01䜕的条件下,䜕于䜕䜕°C䜕水热处理䜕29䜕h䜕后可合成出比表面积高达䜕161䜕m2/g䜕和平均孔径为䜕2.6䜕nm䜕的蠕虫状介孔䜕SnO2.䜕䜕所制得样品具有较好的紫外光吸收性能,䜕适宜用作催化剂、载体和气体传感器等.䜕䜕 Graphical abstract High-surface-area rutile-structured SnO2 nanocrystals with wormhole-like mesopores were fabricated under poly(ethylene glycol)- assisted hydrothermal conditions.
