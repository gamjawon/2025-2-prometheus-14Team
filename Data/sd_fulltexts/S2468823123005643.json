A series of pyridylbenzotriazole iron (II) complexes with general formula (L2FeCl2) were synthesized and characterized by IR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. Determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, complex Fe1 adopts a distorted octahedral geometry. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the activity of the complex for isoprene polymerization decreased as the bulkiness of the substituent at 6-position of the pyridyl ring of the ligand increased. Notably, Fe1 exhibited excellent activity of 4.1 × 106 g/(mol (Fe)•h), affording polymers with ultra-high molecular weight (M n = 2380 × 103 g/mol) and narrow distributions (M w/M n = 1.72). The resulting polyisoprenes possessed predominantly cis-1,4/3,4 alternating structure and short cis-1,4 and 3,4 sequences, irrespective of the reaction conditions, indicating high thermal stability of the catalyst. Moreover, the prepared polyisoprene composite showed higher mechanical properties compared to SSBR-2466 and SSBR-5025 which are the key components of current commercial tread rubber, and had comparable wet traction and superior rolling resistance.

To this end, a variety of coordination catalysts have been developed over the past two decades, allowing to access well-defined polymers (in particular originating from 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, the two industrially important monomers) with cis-1,4, trans-1,4, syndio-, atactic-3,4 and/or 1,2 regular microstructures. Some multicomponent catalysts have been utilized industrially to produce high cis-1,4 polybutadiene and polyisoprene. Currently, the research activity in this field has particularly focused on structurally well-defined transition metal (e.g., cobalt, iron, chromium, and titanium) and lanthanide complexes [3–9]. The ligand bound to the metal plays a crucial role for the activity and regio- and stereoselectivity of catalyst [10–14] Recently, there is a considerable resurgence of interest in iron-based catalysts with well-defined structures in (di)olefin polymerization, owing to its earth abundance and low toxicity as well as economic and environmental benefits [15–17]. Although the first report of iron-catalyzed 1,3-diene polymerization can date back to the early 1960s, less attention since then was dedicated due to the very low activity of the catalysts. Porri and Ricci groups revitalized such research, they reported that bipyridine or phenanthroline iron complexes were extremely active for 1,3-diene polymerizations and gave highly stereoregular polymers, syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene, 3,4-polyisoprene, and (E)-1,2 poly(3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene) [18–20]. The same group recently used iminopyridine iron catalysts to prepare polyisoprenes with a predominantly cis-1,4/3,4 alternating structure and short cis-1,4 unit sequences, which showed superior elastic properties compared to synthetic cis-1,4 polyisoprene [21]. Ritter and co-workers demonstrated that the selectivity of iminopyridine iron catalysts could be tunable by varying the imine moiety, thereby affording cis-1,4 and trans-1,4 polyisoprenes [22]. Our group reported 2-pyrazolyl substituted 1,10-phenanthroline iron complexes, which, by virtue of thermally activated anti-syn isomerization of the terminal η 3-allyl-Fe intermediate at elevated temperatures, produced high trans-1,4 polybutadienes [23]. Wang and coworkers synthesized unsymmetrical binuclear iminopyridine and aminopyridine iron complexes, which exhibited very high activity (up to 6.8 × 106 g / (mol (Fe)•h) and gave polyisoprenes with quasi-equal amount of cis-1,4/3,4 units [24,25]. Benzotriazole as a versatile synthetic auxiliary has been extensively used in organic chemistry and served as a ligand motif in coordination chemistry [26,27]. Recently, some examples of benzotriazole-based metal complexes for small molecule catalysis have been documented. For instance, 1-(2-pyridyl)benzotriazole copper complexes was reported to synthesize a wide range of propargylamine through the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives [28]. Singh et al. demonstrated that 1-(2-pyridyl)benzotriazole ligated (para-cymene) Ru(II) complexes were highly active in oxidation of aryl olefin and transfer hydrogenation of aromatic carbonyl compounds [29]. However, to our knowledge, the use of benzotriazole-based complexes for coordination polymerization is almost an unexplored research field. Given the more flexible CN bond between benzotriazole and pyridine compared to the rigid CC bond in bipyridine which has been previously used in iron complexes and the electron rich nature of the framework [30,31], pyridylbenzotriazole ligand is expected to easily accommodate to the metal coordination and render the generated active species more stable at high temperatures [32]. In this study, a series of pyridylbenzotriazole ligated iron (II) dichloride complexes were synthesized, and their catalytic behaviors for isoprene polymerization were investigated. As expected, the 1-(2-pyridyl)benzotriazole iron complex exhibited high thermal stability and very high activity (4.1 × 106 g / (mol(Fe)•h)) and produced polymers with ultra-high molecular weights (M n ˃ 2200 × 103) and narrow molecular weight distributions (M w /M n ∼1.7). Moreover, the resulting polyisoprenes had a predominantly cis-1,4/3,4 alternating structure and short cis-1,4 and 3,4 sequences, similar to the recently reported ones [33]. Because these polymers might possess the features of 3,4-enrichment polyisoprene which exhibits good wet traction and rolling resistance and high cis-1,4 polyisoprene that has excellent mechanical properties [34,35]. Therefore, the properties of the synthesized polyisoprene as the tire tread rubber were further investigated, along with two commercial SSBR products for comparison. 2 Experimental section 2.1 General procedures and materials All manipulations were performed under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen using Schlenk techniques or in a glove box. Toluene (Damao, AR) was purified by distillation under nitrogen from Na/benzophenone. Isoprene (Macklin, > 99.0%) was refluxed over CaH2 and distilled prior to use. Iron (II) chloride (Bidepharm, 98%), 2‑bromo-6-methylpyridine(Bidepharm, 98%), 2,6-dibromopyridine (Bidepharm, 97%), naphthalen-1-ylboronic acid (Bidepharm, 98%), 1H-benzotriaole (Energy Chemical, 98%), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Innochem, 99%), 2-bromopyridine (J&K, 98%), phenylboronic acid (Energy Chemical, 98%), cesium carbonate (Innochem, 99%), methylaluminoxane (MAO, Albemarle, 1.5 mol/L in toluene), triisobutylaluminium (Al i Bu3, Macklin, 1.0 mol/L in hexanes), ethylaluminum sesquichloride (Al2Et3Cl3, Infinity Scientific, 0.4 mol/L in hexanes), and diethylaluminum chloride (AlEt2Cl, Aladdin, 1.0 mol/L in hexanes) were used as received. Styrene butadiene rubbers (SSBR5025, 1,2-content of 49.3%, Styrene of 19.3%; SSBR2466, 1,2-content of 52.7% Styrene of 17.8%) were provided by LANXESS Energizing Chemistry, China. Other chemicals were commercially available and used as received. 1-(Pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (L1), 1-(6-Methylpyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (L2), and 1-(6-Bromopyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (L3) were synthesized according to the literature methods [36–38]. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Advance III 400 MHz spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were carried out at 30 °C using THF as eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min equipped with Waters 1515 isocratic HPLC pump, Styragel HR2 and HR4 columns in series (300 mm × 8 mm), and a differential refractive index detector. The system was calibrated with PS standards. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Tracer-100 spectrometer equipped with a ZnSe ATR accessory spectrophotometer. Elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (UNICUBE, Elementar Trading, Germany). The curing characteristics of all rubber composites were measured at 150 °C using a rotorless curemeter (MDR-2000E, Electronics Wuxi Liyuan Chemical Equipment Co., Ltd., China). The scorch time (t10), cure time (t90), minimum torque (ML), and maximum torque (MH) were determined from the curing curve according to ISO 6502. The crosslink density of the cured composites was measured by the equilibrium solvent swelling method [39]. The bound rubber content (BRC) of all samples was determined according to the reported method to characterize the interactions between the rubber matrix and silica [39]. The viscoelastic performance (storage modulus (G′) as functions of scanning temperature) of composites was measured by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA850, TA instrument Co., USA). The strain amplitude and frequency were fixed at 0.1% and 1 Hz, respectively, and the temperature was varied from −80 to 80 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. The mechanical properties of composites were measured on a universal testing machine (Instron 3366, USA) at room temperature with a crosshead speed of 50 mm/min. The initial distance (10 mm) between the two clamps remained constant for each sample. 2.2 Synthesis of ligands and complexes 1-(6-Phenylpyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (L4): L3 (1.65 g, 6.0 mmol), phenylboronic acid (1.02 g, 8.4 mmol), Cs2CO3 (3.12 g, 9.6 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.348 g, 0.3 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (50 mL) was added into a 200 mL flask and stirred at reflux for 6 h. After addition of water, the reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After evaporating the solvent, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 8/1, v/v) to give the target product.

The mixture was preheated at 25 °C for 5 min and then MAO (0.6 mmol) was injected to initiate the polymerization. After 1 h, a small amount of acidified ethanol containing 2,6-di-t‑butyl‑4-methylphenol (1 wt%) was added to quench the reaction. The formed polymer was coagulated, repeatedly washed with ethanol, and then dried in vacuum at 40 °C to constant weight. The polymer yield was determined by gravimetry. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of iron complexes Ligands L1-L5 were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction of benzotriazole with 2-bromopyridine and its derivatives and subsequent Suzuki coupling reaction, and the corresponding complexes (Fe1-Fe5) were prepared by the treatment of anhydrous FeCl2 with the corresponding ligand in toluene or ethanol (Scheme 1 ). All the complexes were characterized by IR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. In the IR spectrum, the absorption peak of the N = N group of benzotriazole shifts from ca. 1288 cm−1 for the ligand to ca. 1246 cm−1 for the complex (Figs. S1–S5), indicating coordination of the nitrogen atom to the central metal. In addition, the structure of complex Fe1 was characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1 , and the crystal and refinement parameters are collected in Tables S1 and S2. Single crystal of Fe1 suitable for X-ray structure determination was obtained by slow diffusion of n-pentane into its saturated ethanol solution. Fe1 adopts a distorted octahedral geometry formed by two pyridylbenzotriazole ligands and two chlorine atoms, similar to the iminopyridine FeCl2 complex reported by Wang et al. [40]. The four coordinated nitrogen atoms and Fe (II) center are coplanar, and the triazole ring and phenyl ring on benzotriazole are almost parallel with the pyridine ring with dihedral angles of 4.33° and 3.05°, respectively, indicating an open environment around the metal center. The bond distances of Fe1-N (benzotriazole) [Fe1-N3: 2.188(8) Å, Fe1-N3A (2.188(8) Å] and Fe1-N (pyridine) [Fe1-N1: 2.177(6) Å, Fe1-N1A: 2.177(6) Å] are all shorter than those of Fe-N(pyridyl) bonds [2.204(5) Å and 2.204(5) Å] in Wang's complex, likely due to the electron rich nature of the ligand. 3.2 Isoprene polymerization With Fe1 as a catalyst precursor, the influence of cocatalyst on isoprene polymerization was initially investigated, and the results are summarized in Table 1. MAO-based system quantitatively converted the monomer to polymer with high molecular weight (M n = 2380 × 103) at 25 °C within 1 h, while Al i Bu3, AlEt2Cl, and Al2Et3Cl3-based systems exhibited low activity or were inactive toward isoprene polymerization. The catalytic performance of MAO-based system was further examined at elevated temperatures. With increasing the reaction temperature, the polymerization rate was significantly accelerated. At 70 °C, complete polymerization was achieved within 5 min (entry 4, Table 1). It should be noted that this system exhibited extremely high activity (4.1 × 106 g / (mol (Fe)•h)), which is comparable to the recently reported highly active unsymmetrical binuclear iminopyridine-iron catalyst by Wang et al. (6.7 × 106 g/(mol (Fe)•h)) [25], and superior to the aminopyridine iron(II) chloride catalyst (1.9 × 106 g/(mol (Fe)•h) [24] and iron-based catalyst with diphenylphosphite as donor (0.5 × 105 g/(mol (Fe)•h) [41]. Determined by IR and NMR spectroscopies, all the resulting polyisoprenes possessed a quasi-equal amount of cis-1,4/3,4 units and no characteristic peaks of trans-1,4 were detected (vide infra), irrespective of the reaction temperature. These results indicated that this catalyst has high thermal stability, which is different from most previously reported late transition metal-based systems that usually suffered from the decay of activity and/or variation of selectivity as polymerization temperature increased [42,43]. The GPC curves of the polymers were unimodal and the molecular weight distributions were fairly narrow (M w/M n = 1.68–1.88), implying the single site nature of the catalyst. The resulting polymer had similar microstructure of the polyisoprenes reported by Ricci et al. [33], which had a predominantly cis-1,4/3,4 alternating structure and short cis-1,4 sequences. In the 13C NMR spectrum of the sample (Figs. 2 and S6, entry 3 in Table 1), the signals at 125.13 and 135.39 ppm are characteristic of short cis-1,4 sequences, and the signals at 126.41 and 133.56 ppm are attributable to the cis-1,4 and 3,4 units of the perfectly alternating cis-1,4/3,4 sequences. Since the signal at 15.8 ppm assignable to the trans-1,4 unit was not detected [44], the additional weak signals around 123.38 ppm might be ascribed to the short 3,4 sequences. The T g values of the polyisoprenes were in the range of ‒44∼‒30 °C, depending on the cis-1,4 content, which are much lower than the perfectly cis-1,4-alt-3,4 polymer (ca. ‒15 °C) [45], which further confirmed the presence of short cis-1,4 sequences. Upon activation by MAO, complexes Fe1-Fe5 were examined for the polymerization of isoprene (Table 2 ). As the bulkiness of the substituent at 6-position of pyridyl ring of the ligand increased, the activity decreased in the order of Fe1 > Fe2 > Fe3 > Fe4∼Fe5, which is likely due to steric reason. For instance, Fe1 without substituent exhibited the highest activity; the yield reached 95% within 3 min, whereas, even prolonging the polymerization time to 5 h, Fe2 and Fe3 with methyl and bromine substituents gave polymers in 58% and 50% yields, respectively. On the other hand, all the complexes yielded polyisoprenes with mixed 1,4/3,4 structures, and the 1,4 units were exclusively of cis-configuration, while the 3,4-contents were in the range of 36.8%∼45.1%. Similar results were also observed in the cases of Fe(bipy)2Cl2, iminopyridine Fe, and aminopyridine Fe-catalyzed isoprene polymerizations [20,24,46]. The plausible mechanism for the formation of the resultant polyisoprene is shown in Scheme 2 . It is generally accepted that the stereo- and regio-selectivity of diene polymerization depend on the coordination mode of the incoming monomer to the central metal and the terminal structure of polymer growing chain [42]. Considering the open environment around the Fe center and its electrophilic nature as well as the polymerization results, the isoprene monomer would coordinate to the Fe center via a cis-η4 mode, and migratory insertion of the coordinated monomer generates an anti-η3 allyl-Fe intermediate. The insertion of coordinated monomer at C1 forms a cis-1,4 unit, while a 3,4 unit is generated by insertion at C3. While trans-1,4 could be formed through the isomerization of anti-η3 allyl terminal growing chain to anti-η3 conformation, this process might be uncompetitive in energy due to the metal environment [47]. 3.3 Integrated performances of filled vulcanizates Considering the potential “magic triangle” performance superiority of the resulting polyisoprene (PI, Table 1, entry 3) as a tire tread rubber, its composite was prepared along with SSBR-2466 and SSBR-5025 which are the key components of current commercial tread rubber for comparison, and the corresponding curing curves and parameters are shown in Fig. 3 A and Table S3. The PI composite exhibited the fastest curing rate. Moreover, the crosslink density (Fig. 3B) and the torque increment (ΔM) of the PI composite were comparable to SSBR-2466 and higher than SSBR-5025, indicating that the PI and SSBR-2466 composites have more rigid crosslink network than that of the SSBR-5025 composite. The bound rubber contents (BRCs) of these rubber compounds were measured to quantify the interfacial interaction between the rubber matrix and carbon black. As shown in Fig. 3B, the PI compound had the highest BRC (25.5%), nearly twice those of the SSBR ones, indicating that the PI composite has the strongest interfacial interaction between the polymer matrix and nanofillers. This is likely due to the higher chain flexibility of PI than SSBRs, thus rendering the PI chains more accessible to anchor the fillers for interfacial adsorption. The crosslink network strength of the PI composite and strong interfacial interaction between PI and carbon black could transfer stress effectively throughout the rubber matrix to further impact the performance of rubber composites (vide infra). The viscoelastic performance of the PI composite was evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA, Fig. 4 A). As a rule, the higher value at 0 °C and the lower value at 60 °C of damping factor (tan δ) reflect the better wet skid resistance and rolling resistance of tire tread rubber [48]. The tan δ value at 0 °C for the PI composite is higher than that of SSBR-2466 and lower than that of SSBR-5025, while, at 60 °C, the PI composite exhibits the lowest tan δ value. These facts indicate that the PI composite has comparable wet skid resistance and superior rolling resistance than the two commercial tread rubbers. As the stress-strain curves and parameters shown in Fig. 4B and Table 3 , the PI composite exhibited higher tensile strength (10.3 MPa) and elongation at break (349%) compared to the SSBR-2466 composite (8.9 MPa and 303%, respectively). Since the two composites had similar crosslink densities, this result could be ascribed to the stronger interfacial interaction between PI and carbon black, thereby effectively reducing the stress concentration and facilitating finite chain extensibility. On the other hand, the SSBR-5025 composite showed the highest elongation at break and the lowest tensile strength, as expected in the case of oil-extended rubber. Given the good wet traction, low rolling resistance, and high mechanical properties, the synthesized PI has great potential for the fabrication of green tires. 4 Conclusions In summary, we have prepared a new family of pyridylbenzotriazole iron (II) dichloride complexes. The open environment around the central metal and electron rich nature of the ligand renders the complex as a catalyst precursor highly active and thermally stable in isoprene polymerization. Upon activation of MAO, complex Fe1 showed the activity up to 4.1 × 106 g / (mol (Fe)•h), among the highest values reported so far for late transition metal catalyzed isoprene polymerization, and the microstructures of the obtained polyisoprenes were hardly influenced by the reaction conditions. These features are essential for industrial applications. Furthermore, given the high mechanical properties as well as high wet traction and low rolling resistance performance, the polyisoprene product has great potential to use as a tread rubber for the fabrication of green tires.

        "dc:description": "A series of pyridylbenzotriazole iron (II) complexes with general formula (L2FeCl2) were synthesized and characterized by IR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. Determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, complex Fe1 adopts a distorted octahedral geometry. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the activity of the complex for isoprene polymerization decreased as the bulkiness of the substituent at 6-position of the pyridyl ring of the ligand increased. Notably, Fe1 exhibited excellent activity of 4.1 × 106 g/(mol (Fe)•h), affording polymers with ultra-high molecular weight (M n = 2380 × 103 g/mol) and narrow distributions (M w/M n = 1.72). The resulting polyisoprenes possessed predominantly cis-1,4/3,4 alternating structure and short cis-1,4 and 3,4 sequences, irrespective of the reaction conditions, indicating high thermal stability of the catalyst. Moreover, the prepared polyisoprene composite showed higher mechanical properties compared to SSBR-2466 and SSBR-5025 which are the key components of current commercial tread rubber, and had comparable wet traction and superior rolling resistance.",
