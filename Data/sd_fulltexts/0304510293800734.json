Oehme*, U. Gebauer and K. Gehrke University of Greifswald, Dept. of Technical Chemistry, Soldtmannstr. 16, 2200 Greifswald (Germany) Abstract This contribution is concerned with part of a study on the homopolymerization and copolymerization of dienes with a catalytic system formed from an organoaluminium compound, a Lewis acid and a neodymium salt. The stereospecific polymerization of butadiene was investigated with a neodymium octoate-diethylaluminium chloride-triethylaluminium catalyst in n-heptane. The concentration of the three catalyst components was varied and the results of the determination of conversion, microstructure and molecular weight are illustrated. The optimum catalyst concentration ratio of the butadiene polymerization was fixed and used for the copolymerization of butadiene/isoprene. Copolymers obtained under various monomer charge ratios were characterized by 'H-NMR spectroscopy. The intrinsic viscosity, the number average molecular weight and the reactivity ratios were also determined. Key words: butadiene; copolymerization; homopolymerization; neodymium catalyst Introduction During the last few years considerable interest has been shown in the polymerization of 1,3-dienes with catalysts derived from lanthanide compounds (from lanthanum to lutetium). The lanthanide catalysts are known to be highly stereospecific, producing both high cis-polybutadiene and high cis-polyisoprene, as well as the high cis-copolymerization of the two monomers [ 1 ] . One of the first lanthanide catalysts reported for diolefin polymerization was a binary system consisting of a rare-earth chloride and trialkylaluminium. However, its low activity meant that it was not studied extensively. Other catalysts based on ternary systems consisting of lanthanide salts, alkylaluminium halides and trialkylaluminiO were developed later. Series of high activity lanthanide catalysts were described by Chinese, Italian, German and Russian scientists [ 2-5 ] . However, still better lanthanide catalysts are needed to produce new, improved and lower-priced polymers. *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved. 84 A. Oehme et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 83-91 This paper examines the following aspects of the polymerization with a neodymium catalyst: (1) homopolymerization of butadiene: concentration ratios of the catalyst compounds, Nd (oct) 3/Al (Et) ZCl/Al (Et) 3; and (2) copolymerization of butadiene and isoprene: variation of the monomer charge ratio. Experimental Materials Commercial butadiene was purified by passing it through three successive columns that contained paraffin oil, NaOH and Al (Et) 3. Isoprene (Merck) was freed of the inhibitor by distillation. The solvent n-heptane was dried over CaCl2 and CaH2 and then refluxed and distilled over sodium benzophenone ketyl under argon. Neodymium octoate was prepared from the reaction of neodymium acetate and 2-ethyl-caproic acid according to the method given in ref. 6. Al (Et) 2C1 and Al (Et) 3 diluted in heptane as 1 and 10 wt. % solutions were obtained from Schering AG. Polymerization and copolymerization All procedures were performed in an atmosphere of purified argon. The polymerization was carried out at catalyst concentration of 1.53 mmol Nd/1 and monomer concentration of 0.73 mol/1. The catalyst was prepared with component molar ratio Nd (oct) 3 : Al (Et) 2C1: Al (Et) 3 =1: 2.5:40. The catalyst components were mixed in the following order: first neodymium octoate, then diethylaluminium chloride and finally triethylaluminium, followed by ageing at 25 C for 30 min. After the ageing time a prescribed amount of n-heptane and butadiene or butadiene and isoprene was added to the glass reactor in which the catalyst was prepared. The polymerization and the copolymerization were carried out at 60 C for 120 min. After stripping steam distillation the polymers were dried at 45 C under vacuum. Measurements The viscosity average molecular weight was determined in toluene at 30 C with an Ubbelohde viscosimeter and the number average molecular weight of the samples was measured in toluene by a Knauer membrane osmometer. The microstructure of the homopolymers was measured by IR spectrophotometry according to the method of Morero et al. [ 7 ] . The composition of the copolymers was determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Results and discussion A variety of new lanthanide catalysts suitable for diene homopolymerization and copolymerization has been developed. The catalyst system is a highly active and efficient catalyst for stereospecific diene polymerization. A. Oehme et al./J. Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 83-91 Homopolymerization of butadiene 85 Al(Et)ZCl is a very active cocatalyst compound. The mole ratio of Al (Et) ZCl/Nd (oct) 3 has an important influence on the conversion, the viscosity average molecular weight and the cis-1,4-content [ 8 ] . Maximum conversion (95%) is obtained by increasing the Al (Et) 2C1/Nd (oct) 3 mole ratio (Fig.1). The viscosity average molecular weight also rises with increasing mole ratio. Polymers with viscosity average molecular weights between 90000 and 190000 g/mol are obtained. The cis-1,4-content is in the range of 85 to 88% (Fig. 2) . The effect of the Lewis acid was studied. It appears that the presence of the Lewis acid is necessary for this catalyst system and the amount of Lewis acid should be optimized. The presence of large amounts of Lewis acid would diminish or inhibit the catalytic activity. The conversion, the viscosity average molecular weight and the microstructure can be varied by varying the Al(Et)3/Nd(oct)3 mole ratio. A conversion of over 80% is obtained with an Al(Et)3/Nd(oct)3 mole ratio of 20 (Fig. 3 ). This shows the high activity of the catalyst system. The cis-1,4-content can usually be increased by reducing the mole ratio of Al(Et)3/Nd(oct)3. It changes from 86 to 94%. The cis-1,4-content of 94% is quite high for a rare-earth catalyst system with Al(Et)3. The cis-1,4-content would be higher with another aluminiumtrialkyl, such as Al (i-Bu) 3 [ 1 ] . The effect of the variation of the Al (Et) 3/Nd (oct) 3 mole ratio on the viscosity average molecular weight was investigated. The viscosity average molecular weights can be varied from less than 100000 g/mol to more than 500000 g/mol (Fig. 4) .

Among the lanthanide elements, neodymium was found to have the highest catalytic activity. Cerium, praseodymium and gadolinium are next, whereas the others either do not polymerize the two dienes or show low activities [ 5 ] . The results on the variation of the concentration of Nd(oct)3 show a maximum. The maximum conversion is to nearly 95% (Fig. 5).

The dependence of the conversion on the composition of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 7. The objective of this kind of variation was to discover an effective catalyst composition having a high activity, a high cis- 1,4-content and a high viscosity average molecular weight. The following facts were discovered: The mole ratio of Al (Et)3/Nd(oct)3 can vary from 10 to 60, but the preferred mole ratio of this system is 25; the most favorable molar ratio of Lewis acid to 88 A.

Copolymerization of butadiene and isoprene In contrast to the behaviour of catalysts based on titanium, cobalt or nickel, the lanthanide catalysts not only induce butadiene and isoprene to polymerize stereospecifically, but also to copolymerize [9,10]. A. Oehme et al./J Mol. Catal. 82 (1993) 83-91 89 Butadiene and isoprene were copolymerized with the neodymium catalyst under the same polymerization conditions described for the homopolymerization. We studied the dependence of the conversion, the intrinsic viscosity and the number average molecular weight on the composition of monomer mixtures. The conversion decreases with an increasing isoprene content in the monomer mixture (Fig. 8). Fig. 9 shows the relationships between the intrinsic viscosity, the number average molecular weight and the various monomer compositions.

Polymers obtained with various monomer charge ratios were characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. It seems that the copolymerization of butadiene and isoprene under the above mentioned conditions is an ideal copolymerization and the reactivity ratio of butadiene and isoprene must be approximately 1 (Fig. 10). The real reactivity ratio of butadiene and isoprene was calculated by the Kelen-Tudos method with a monomer reactivity ratio of butadiene, rBd=1.09 and that of isoprene, rbo=1.32. Conclusion The results obtained on the neodymium catalysed homopolymerization and copolymerization represent a significant achievement in the synthesis of stereospecific polybutadiene, polyisoprene and butadiene/isoprene copolymer. The optimized catalyst composition described here is very effective for producing polybutadiene with a high cis-1,4-content. The cis-1,4-content, the molecular weight and the conversion can be controlled over a broad range and nearly independently of one another by varying the molar ratio of the catalyst components. The molecular weight can be regulated from less than 100000 to more than 500000 g/mol and the cis-1,4-content from 78 to 94% . The neodymium catalyst system is also suitable for polymerizing isoprene and copolymerizing butadiene and isoprene. References 1 H.L. Hsieh and H.C. Yeh, Rubber Chem. Technol., 58 (1) (1985 ). A.
