S. CAMERON Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Reading, RG4 9NH (U.K.) Summary Phosphoric acid fuel cells are rapidly approaching commercial avail- ability, with major demonstration programmes in progress by electric and gas supply utilities in America and Japan. Without exception, these are catalysed by carbon-supported platinum catalysts. Operation of the fuel cells at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures imposes stringent requirements on these electrocatalysts and electrode materials. This paper reviews the progress being made to meet these demands. Introduction Fuel cells are devices for converting fuel and oxidant directly to electrical energy. Because this is an electrochemical conversion process which does not involve combustion and heat transfer, the limitations to efficiency imposed by the Camot heat cycle [1] do not apply, so that, at least in theory, they can be almost 100% efficient. In practice, loss of efficiency results from ohmic resistance, electrode polarisation and power for pumps and controls, reducing this to perhaps 60 - 80%. By comparison, present day power stations generate steam using heat from fossil or nuclear fuels. The chain of turning heat into steam, steam into mechanical energy and then to electricity is at best 35 - 40% efficient for the largest, most modem plant. Fuel conversion efficiency for conventional thermal power stations is linked to large size, with consequent problems of power distribution and disposal of waste heat. The efficiency of the fuel cell is largely independent of size, so that generators of only a few kilowatts can equal or better those of the largest thermal stations. The major distinguishing feature between a fuel cell and an electric storage battery is that the reactants are stored outside the fuel cell in the form of gases or liquids, and the fuel cell may be a relatively small, compact unit. Since the fuel and oxidant are store separately, and only combined at the time of reaction, the system is intrinsically safe. Since it is an engine, it will continue running as long as reactants are fed to it. The potential for obtaining high power density using cryogenically stored hydrogen and oxygen led to fuel cells initially being developed as power sources for spacecraft, 0304-6102/86/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 28 where the gases are also used for propulsion engines and life support systems. The water product is also used for drinking by the crew. Fuel cells have subsequently been modified for terrestrial applications, principally by changing to atmospheric air as the oxidant, and using hydrogen generated from hydrocarbons by a steam reforming process. They have also been scaled up from a few kilowatts to several megawatts. Principles of operation of fuel cells Most people are familiar with the principle of electro lysers. In this device, direct current is passed through a pair of inert 'electrodes' immersed in an electrolyte, usually an aqueous solution of acid or alkali. This results in the decomposition of the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The fuel cell is the direct converse of this, using catalysed electrodes to produce a controlled oxidation of hydrogen, with the formation of water and the passage of electric current. The first cells were constructed as long ago as 1839 by William Grove [2] who built 'batteries' of up to 50 cells in series, and conducted numerous experiments using fuel cell generators. In the simple unit cell. Fig. 1, the anode is supplied with hydrogen and the cathode with oxygen. The electrodes are electrically conductive and porous so that gases can diffuse through them. Between the electrode pair is an electrolyte, usually a strong acid or alkali. The purpose of this is to prevent mixing of the molecular gases fed to the electrodes, while permitting ions to pass from one electrode to the other carrying an electrical current. An external load across the electrodes completes the circuit. Passage of electrons through the load resistance constitutes the work done by the cell. External load Oxygen Fig. 1. Simple fuel cell.

The standard free energy change (AG ) is related to the standard electromotive force (e ) by the relationship: AG = nFe ..Forthe formation of water AG is 113.38 kcal mor1 of oxygen consumed, so that e0 for the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell at 25 C is 1.229 V. In practice, this reversible potential is never attained, due to trace impurities and side reactions such as peroxide formation, which occur mainly at the oxygen electrode [3]. The functions of the catalyst If a piece of inert metal (M) is immersed in acid and covered by hydrogen gas bubbles, some of the hydrogen molecules dissolve in the acid under equilibrium conditions. At the metal surface, some of these dissolved hydrogen molecules attach themselves loosely to the metal by donating electrons from their bonding orbitais. A number of these atoms then become detached, leaving an electron in the metal. V2II2 (gas) =^ ^HZ (dissolved) ^Hz (dissolved) + (M) ^ (M) H => M + H* + e~ The process is reversible, the exchange of electrons constituting a current flowing into and out of the metal. Under equilibrium conditions, the rate at which electrons are discharged at the metal surface equals the rate at which they are released back into the electrolyte. This rate is termed the exchange current density. The electrode material largely determines the properties of the metal-hydrogen bond, and the exchange current density is in turn dependent on the bond strength. The highest exchange current densities, about 10~3 mA cm~2, are obtained with platinum group metals, where hydrogen is weakly adsorbed on the metal surface, enabling a rapid formation and breaking of metal-hydrogen bonds. For metals with a high positive heat of adsorption, such as mercury, lead, tellurium, zinc and cadmium, the metal-hydrogen bond is weak com- 30 pared with the hydrogen-hydrogen bond. Only a small proportion of the hydrogen (H;) molecules have sufficient energy to dissociate and bond to the metal, thus the exchange current is low (10~9 mA cm\"2). When hydrogen is strongly bonded to metals, as with molybdenum, tantalum and tungsten, it is so firmly adsorbed that further reaction is restricted, and the exchange current is again low (1CT8 mA cm\"2). Note that these exchange currents are for the real area of metal surface. Due to roughness factors, these values may be several orders of magnitude higher than geometric areas. The overall effect is a 'volcano plot' of exchange current density versus M H bond strength, with the platinum group metals at the apex of the curve. When a current flows to or from the electrode to an external source, the rates of reaction become unbalanced. The change in electrode potential required to achieve this inequality is termed overpotential. Metals with high exchange current densities exhibit lower overpotentials than do metals with low exchange current densities. Noble metal catalysts are particularly effective in fuel cells, due to their high exchange current densities and their resistance to oxidation and dis- solution under operating conditions. Improving catalyst performance Overpotential represents a loss in voltage and therefore loss in efficiency. Because operating cells have to conduct high currents to do useful work, it is clearly desirable to limit overpotential and other voltage losses as much as possible. To achieve this, we can increase exchange current densities by increasing reactant concentrations, pressures and temperatures. In addition, we should use the most catalytically active metal available and should have as large an active catalyst surface area as possible. High metal areas are generally obtained by dispersing the precious metal over an inert, electrically conducting substrate such as powdered carbon. Although the relatively simple hydrogen ionization reaction is used to illustrate the catalyst function, many reactions proceed via a series of inter- mediate steps involving a variety of chemical species. This is especially true of the oxygen reduction electrode or cathode. The catalyst may then act to increase the rate of the slowest, i.e. the limiting, step and thus increase the overall reaction rate. The most recent cathode catalysts comprise binary alloys of platinum with base metals such as chromium, vanadium, titanium etc. [4], and ternary alloys such as platinum-cobalt-chromium [5]. These have a higher intrinsic activity than pure platinum and give considerably enhanced current-voltage characteristics. Figure 2 shows the performance of Pt V and Pt Cr alloys compared to platinum in a floating electrode half-cell configuration. Various theories have been proposed to explain these activity improvements, including changes in 31 900 800 600 500 10 100 LOG CURRENT DENSITY mA/cm2 1000 Fig. 2. Effect of addition of base metal alloying components to platinum cathode electro- catalysts. the platinum crystallographic structure by producing lattice strain to match the bond length of the oxygen molecule. Other mechanisms include changes in the band gap structure and hence the metal-oxygen bond strength due to alloying. At least some of the activity improvements observed in the alloy catalysts result from sintering of the platinum into larger crystallites. This arises during thermal treatments employed in making the alloys. Activity improvements may be observed when sintering pure platinum catalysts, although to a less marked extent. Very high platinum dispersions (co. 200 m2 g\"1 Pt) or approaching theoretical metal area, may be prepared on carbons and some loss of metallic properties is observed in these circumstances. Figures 3 and 4 show transmission electron micrographs of a 3% platinum catalyst, one in the 'as prepared' state, and the second after deliberate thermal treatment at 1000 C to induce sintering of the platinum. The metal areas as determined by chemisorption of carbon monoxide were 50.4 m2 g\"1 Pt and 48.8 m2 g\"1 Pt respectively. Other samples heated to 500, 700 and 850 C produced metal areas of 67.7,109.7 and 95.6 m2 g\"1 respectively. At the higher temperatures, the increasingly metallic nature of the crystallites are counteracted by area reduction due to sintering. In order to obtain effective use of the platinum, catalysts of up to 150 m2 g~1 Pt are prepared on a production scale. For comparison, the highest areas for platinum blacks (i.e. unsupported metal) are of the order of 30 - 40 m2 g~1. The effect of the 32 Fig. 3. Transmission electron micrograph of a 3% platinum on carbon catalyst (magnifica- tion x380 000). Fig. 4. Transmission electron micrograph of the same catalyst after sintering at 1000 C (magnification X 380 000). carbon support is to improve mass transport properties and resistance to metal crystallite migration and sintering during cell operation. The choice of support material therefore has a major influence on catalyst performance. Loss of metal area by sintering may be partially offset by increased activity of the resulting larger crystallites, although sintering causes a decrease in catalyst activity in the early life of the fuel cell. However, as the mean size of the crystallites increases, they become less mobile and the rate of decay decreases. Fuel cell operating conditions Carbon monoxide is preferentially adsorbed on platinum, poisoning the catalytic sites for hydrogen oxidation. This is less strongly bonded at elevated temperatures, and at temperatures above about 180 C fuel cells can be operated on hydrogen from a steam reformer/water-gas shift converter system, even though this contains a small percentage of carbon monoxide. The materials of construction of the fuel cell power section, especially the catalysts, must be good electrical conductors in order to minimise ohmic resistive losses, and also be corrosion resistant in the hot acid electrolyte. Modem cells operate at up to 8 atm pressure and at up to 205 C, and testing is currently in progress at 10 atm and 230 C [7]. The catalysts, with their small particle size and hence high surface area, are particularly vulnerable to corrosion. Various ways have been studied to improve the stability of catalyst supports. These include the use of metallide support materials and various thermal treatments leading to partial graphitisation or degrees of ordering of the carbon structures [11,12]. 33 The requirements of electrodes Fuel cell electrodes appear deceptively simple, since no moving parts or obvious mechanical stresses are involved. They are required to support the catalysts in such a way that a large surface area of interface is created between reactant gases, electrolyte and catalyst. Porous structures are used to allow gas to diffuse to the reaction sites, with only a thin film of electrolyte covering the catalyst. Gases can then dissolve and diffuse rapidly to these reaction sites during cell operation. This electrolyte/gas/solid inter- face is established by incorporating a wet-proofing agent such as polytetra- fluoroethylene (PTFE) into the structure (Fig. 5) in an intimate mixture with the catalyst to form a network of liquid-filled pores interspersed with gas-filled pores. The electrodes must be as thin as possible to facilitate gas diffusion, and to minimise distances for ionic migration within the electrolyte. The electro- lyte layer between the electrodes is kept very thin to minimise ohmic losses. A thin layer of an inert powdered substance such as silicon carbide is also deposited between the electrodes to physically separate them and to form an additional barrier against cross-over of gas bubbles. In the latest cells, each elec- trode structure may be made somewhat thicker and have gas distribution channels incorporated into them. Additional electrolyte may also be stored in the electrodes to allow for volume changes resulting from concentration changes and some evaporation. The electrode consists of a carbon felt or foam material wet-proofed with PTFE to prevent electrolyte migration and covered by a thin layer of catalyst adjacent to the electrolyte.

Hydrophobie electrode structure. 34 Practical fuel cells Individual cells produce about l V at open circuit and typically 0.70 - 0.75 V at normal operating current densities of 2000 - 3000 A m~2. To obtain useful voltages, stacks of cells are formed, with up to 500 cells in series, current being collected from opposite ends of the stack. Gases are distributed across the electrodes by arrays of parallel channels which may be formed in the electrodes themselves or in the intercell separator plates. The stacks may measure up to l m2 in cross-section and several metres high. Gases are dis- tributed through the stacks by manifolds clamped to the sides, and the whole assembly is often encased in a pressure vessel (Fig. 6). In the largest units built to date, stacks are connected in series to provide up to 3000 V output. Hydrogen is generated from natural gas, liquified petroleum gas or naphtha, and studies have been carried out on the feasibility of operation on gasified coal. Sulphur is removed during fuel processing by a hydro-desul- phurising process and carbon monoxide is reduced, but not eliminated, by a water-gas shift reaction. Reactants are maintained at higher than stoichio- metric levels, and excess gases carry away some heat, product water and trace impurities. Excess hydrogen is burned to provide heat in the reforming stage, and some steam is also utilised for the shift reaction. Utilisation of this waste heat gives a significant improvement in overall system efficiency, even when heat is not required by the consumer. The direct current (DC) output from the fuel cells is converted to alternating current (AC) for distribution to the consumer. There is also considerable interest in chemical processing plants such as petroleum refineries and chlorine/caustic manufacture where waste hydrogen is available and the DC power may be required on site.

The first is for electric utility plants suitable for localised areas of population, possibly with piped heat distribution forming a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Secondly, individual buildings and factories can be supplied with power and heat from units installed on site. Two user groups have been formed from electric and gas utilities in the USA and Japan to evaluate and demonstrate the two systems. Two 4.5 MW power plants have been constructed by United Technologies Corporation (USA), one in Manhattan, New York and the other in Goi, Tokyo, for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The New York installation suffered from a series of delays resulting from problems in obtaining approval for installation and from various teething troubles, and it is no longer intended to commission this plant. The Tokyo installation was completed in 1982, two years after the start of construction, first producing power in April 1983. It has since been operated extensively at between 25 and 100 percent of full power. The success of the Tokyo plant, which is shown in Fig. 7, has encouraged the development of two more advanced systems in the United States. The first is an 11 MW plant being developed by United Technologies, and the second is a 7.5 MW system being evolved by Westinghouse. United Technologies Corporation and Toshiba have recently announced the Fig. 7. 4.5 MW fuel cell installation in Tokyo. 36 formation of a joint company. International Fuel Cells Corporation, which initially will construct three 11 MW plants by 1989, and subsequently a further twenty semi-commercial units by 1992 [6]. In Japan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) are sponsoring the development of two l MW systems by 1986. Two consortia, namely Hitachi/Toshiba and Mitsubishi/Fuji Electric, are competing to construct these, in collaboration with various electric utilities. At present, some 35 American and Japanese gas utilities are sponsoring a demonstration of 46 units, each with an output of 40 kW, running on reformed natural gas. These are being deployed as part of the on-site/ integrated energy systems (OS/IES) programme in combined heat and power applications. For example, units are installed in a laundry in Portland, Oregon, a telephone switchboard in Connecticut, a restaurant in Osaka and a swimming pool in Yokohama City. The combined heat and power (CHP) applications provide optimum benefit from the benign characteristics of fuel cells since they can be installed on the user's premises. Studies have shown that there are large numbers of consumers requiring constant supplies of heat and electrical power, including hospitals, hotels, offices and factories. The high ratio of electrical power to heat provides an economic incentive for installation, since the former has considerably higher value. If capital costs can be brought by mass production to a level competitive with con- ventional generators, they can be shown to have a rapid payback period. The generators also provide independent electrical supplies for standby purposes, a major advantage being that they can be constantly running and providing an economic return. Existing standby generators are rarely used, but require regular maintenance and testing. The cells in the demonstration programme have been run for periods of amiost 2 years, giving electrical efficiencies of 40% and an overall efficiency of 80% when recovered heat is included. Currently, the Gas Research Institute, representing the utilities, is sponsoring development of units of 200 to 400 kW size [7]. These redesigned models are now operational at the prototype stage, with an overall efficiency of 89%, and the first installations at the site of Califomian utilities are being planned. Platinum requirements for fuel cells Since the phosphoric acid fuel cell is dependent upon platinum-based catalysts, it is entirely reasonable to ask whether future supplies will be adequate. Taking the most optimistic projection for future fuel cell implementation and no improvements in performance or platinum utilisation, it is interesting to calculate possible demand. The major factor influencing the market size of fuel cells is their capital cost. The various benefits such as efficiency, modular construction and free- dom from pollution would, however, create a vast market provided that 37 costs could be brought down. Present indications are that they become an economic proposition for electric power utilities at about $1000 kW\"1, or $850 to $1250 kW\"1 for the gas utilities applications. With mass production, manufacturing costs as low as $350 kW~1 have been predicted. At an installed cost of $600 kW\"1, the electric utilities in the United States forecast an upper requirement of 45 000 MW to the year 2005. In Japan, MITI announced in December 1984 that the requirement for the Japanese market during this period could amount to 35 000 MW, com- prising 25 000 MW for power utilities and 10 000 MW for small combined heat and power units. A realistic assessment indicates that by the year 2005, new fuel cell installations will amount to some 4000 MW year\"1 in the USA, 4000 MW year\"1 in Japan, and 1000 MW year\"1 elsewhere. The current state of the art, see Fig. 8, indicates that a realistic performance figure is 700 mV at 200 mA cm\"2 of cell area for a phosphoric acid fuel cell [6]. Generally accepted platinum loadings for the anode and cathode are 0.25 mg cm\"2 and 0.5 mg cm\"2, respectively, giving a requirement of 5.36 kg of platinum per megawatt of power. Appleby [8] has quoted figures ranging from 3.4 g kW~1 (Westinghouse) to 7.3 g kW\"1 (some UTC units) which agree with this mean. This then corresponds to a platinum demand ranging from 30 - 65 tonnes year\" t assuming no improvements in catalyst performance or utilisation in the meanwhile. Current annual world platinum consumption is approximately 87 tonnes, of which 27 tonnes (31%) is used in car exhaust pollution control, 25 tonnes (29%) is used in the jewellery trade, 18 tonnes (21%) is used in the manufacture of chemicals, glass, petroleum and electrical products, and 8 50 100 150 200 POWER DENSITY (mW/cm2) Fig. 8. Improvements in phosphoric and fuel cell performance. 38 tonnes (9%) is used for investment. Another 9 tonnes (10%) is used for a variety of other industrial purposes. Although the possible requirement for fuel cells is very large, the platinum industry has historically responded to changes in demand very rapidly. For example, the market for pollution control catalysts grew up within a few years and the supplies rose to meet this requirement. Estimated reserves in the Merensky Reef in South Africa alone amount to 300 years' supply at current extraction rate. Hence, should fuel cells achieve these most optimistic predictions for implementation it should be wholly feasible to meet the increased demand for platinum for this purpose. It should be emphasized that the above is the maximum likely demand for this application. For example, Appleby [8] has quoted 14 000 MW by the year 2008 as being the most likely U.S. installed capacity (Table 1). In practice, the production of fuel cells will begin at a low rate and increase progressively, giving time for platinum production to be increased as required. TABLE 1 United States electric utility market (MW) (EPRI) 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 OPTIMISTIC 60 500 3,400 14,000 30,000 EXPECTED 50 300 1,600 6,000 14,000 PESSIMISTIC 40 175 650 1,850 4,000 The 11 MW plants currently under construction are quoted as having an efficiency of 8300 Btu kWh\"1 [6] at the end of 5 years. When, after five years of use, efficiency begins to fall below this level, the overall performance of the plants can be maintained by annually replacing 2 of the 20 stacks during routine maintenance [10]. It is anticipated that the noble metal content of the cells will be recovered and re-used; indeed the noble metal industry already has a highly effective recycling system. Recovery of the platinum is an added benefit as it reduces the overall cost of fuel cell power plant operation. Considerable quantities of fuel cell catalysts have already been used to develop manufacturing techniques, and recovery of scrap has been shown to be completely feasible. Conclusion To summarise, a huge effort to develop and demonstrate fuel cell systems for gas and electric supply utilities is currently in progress. All the demonstration programmes in the USA and Japan use phosphoric acid fuel cells which employ platinum catalysts for the vital power section. Work is in progress to improve the activity and durability of the catalysts in order to improve the power density, and therefore the economics 39 of the system. The feasibility of the concept and the durability have already been demonstrated, the present programmes being mainly directed to obtain- ing experience of routine operation and maintenance by the supply utilities.

Cameron Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Reading, RG4 9NH U.K. Phosphoric acid fuel cells are rapidly approaching commercial availability, with major demonstration programmes in progress by electric and gas supply utilities in America and Japan. Without exception, these are catalysed by carbon-supported platinum catalysts. Operation of the fuel cells at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures imposes stringent requirements on these electrocatalysts and electrode materials. This paper reviews the progress being made to meet these demands. References 1 S. Carnot Reflexions sur la Puissance Metric du Feu 1824 monograph 2 a W.R. Grove Phil. Mag. 14 1839 127 b W.R.
