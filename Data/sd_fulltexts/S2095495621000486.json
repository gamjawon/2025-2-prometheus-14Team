Graphical abstract 3D macroscopically porous graphene frameworks fabricated by room-temperature fast assembly for binder-free compact supercapacitors with high gravimetric and volumetric capacitances. Synthesis and applications of three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene frameworks (GFs) have attracted extensive interest owing to their intriguing advantages of high specific surface area, enriched porosity, excellent electrical conductivity, exceptional compressibility and processability. However, it is still challenging for economically viable, fast and scalable assembly of 3D GFs at room-temperature. Herein, we reported a one-step scalable strategy for fast self-assembly of graphene oxide into 3D macroscopically porous GFs, with assistance of polyoxometalates (POM) as functional cross-linker and hydrazine hydrate as reductant at room-temperature. The resulting 3D interconnected macroporous POM-GFs uniformly decorated with ultrasmall POM nanoclusters were directly processed into binder-/additive-free film compact electrodes (1.68 g cm−3) with highly aligned, layer-stacked structure and electrically conductivity (622 S m−1) for high-performance supercapacitors, showing an impressive gravimetric capacitance of 205 F g−1, volumetric capacitance of 334 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1, and remarkable cycling stability with capacitance retention of 83% after 10,000 cycles, outperforming the most reported GFs. Further, the solid-state supercapacitors offered excellent gravimetric capacitance of 157 F g−1, exceptionally volumetric capacitance of 115 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 based on single electrode, and volumetric energy density of 2.6 mWh cm−3. Therefore, this work will open novel opportunities to room-temperature fast assembly of 3D porous graphene architectures for high-energy–density supercapacitors. Keywords Graphene frameworks Room-temperature fast assembly Supercapacitors 1 Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene frameworks (GFs) have received considerable attentions because they can greatly prevent the aggregation and restacking of powdered graphene nanosheets, and efficiently retain the intrinsic physiochemical properties of single-layer graphene, offsetting the main disadvantages in practical applications. As a result, 3D GFs possess many intriguing physiochemical properties of large specific surface area, enriched porosity, interconnected conductivity, high mechanical toughness and elasticity, guaranteeing fast mass transport, simplifying the processing of graphene materials and representing great promise in various applications of energy storage and conversion, electronics, catalysis, gas adsorption and separation, drug delivery and environmental applications [1–10]. Several key strategies have been developed to fabricate 3D GFs, including chemical vapor deposition [11], ice-segregation induced self-assembly [2,3], 3D printing [12], hydrothermal/solvothermal assembly [13,14] and chemical reduction self-assembly [15–17]. It is worth noting that chemical vapor deposition can produce high-purity 3D graphene, but limited by high temperature, high cost and time consuming. Ice-segregation induced self-assembly and 3D printing are the simple and scalable methods. However, rapid freezing/vacuum drying at low temperature, preparation of printable graphene oxide (GO) ink, and additional reduction process also lead to high cost and complicated processes. Hydrothermal/solvothermal reduction of GO is currently the most simple, cost-effective approach in the assembly of graphene hydrogel, but generally requires high temperature (e.g., 180 °C) and high pressure. Further, to obtain highly conductive GFs, various reducing agents, such as ammonium sulfide [17], NaHSO3 [18], Na2S [18], HI [18], HBr [19], hydroquinone [18], sodium ascorbate [20,21], cysteine [22], glutathione [23], carbohydrazide [15], p-phenylene diamine [24], phenolic acids [25] and L-phenylalanine [16] have been used for chemical reduction of GO at atmospheric pressure under relatively high temperature (typically > 90 °C). To this end, developing room-temperature assembly strategy of 3D GFs with characteristics of low-cost, scalable and low energy consumption is highly desirable. Polyoxometalates (POM) shows great promise in many applications such as catalysis, solid electrolyte and energy storage owing to outstanding catalytic activity, ionic conductivity and electrochemical behavior [26]. However, the application of POM is still hampered due to high solubility in water and many organic solvents as well as negligible electronic conductivity. To address this obstacle, anchoring POM on a chemically stable, large specific surface area support to yield POM-based composite material is an effective strategy [27]. Recently, 3D porous GFs are excellent candidates for supporting metals and metal oxides (e.g., POM) supports owing to their stability, large specific surface area, abundant functional group and high electronic conductivity, which hold great potential for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices [28,29]. For example, Gomez-Romero et al. reported the synthesis of POM-rGO hybrids with enhanced capacitance of 276 F g−1, higher 30% capacitance than unmodified rGO, contributing to the faradaic charge storage of POM [30]. It is worth noting that POM hybrid electrodes showed big merits in volumetric capacitance compared with gravimetric capacitance on account of the heavy molecule nature of the POM cluster [31]. However, 3D porous GFs modified by POM nanoclusters for supercapacitors with both high gravimetric capacitance and volumetric capacitance have been not yet achieved. Herein we reported a unique and scalable strategy for producing 3D porous GFs (POM-GFs) by room-temperature fast assembly of GO nanosheets with assistance of Faradaic POM and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4). In this system, POM was firstly chemically adsorbed on GO surface bonded with oxygen-containing functional groups, in which POM would further promote the reduction of GO by N2H4, and then serve as functional cross-linker to knit rGO nanosheets into macroscopic 3D POM-GFs. The resulting POM-GFs presented 3D interconnected macroporous network and uniformly decorated with ultrasmall POM nanoclusters. Moreover, the excellent processability of POM-GFs allowed for high-pressure compacting production of mechanically flexible, electrically conducting (622 S m−1) and compact (1.68 g cm−3) films, which were directly used as densely stacked supercapacitor electrodes without adding any other binder and conductive additives, delivering an impressive gravimetric capacitance of 205 F g−1, volumetric capacitance of 334 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1 and remarkable cycling stability with capacitance retention of 83% after 10,000 cycles. Further, the solid-state supercapacitors offered excellent gravimetric capacitance of 157 F g−1, exceptionally volumetric capacitance of 115 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 based on single electrode and volumetric energy density of 2.6 mWh cm−3. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Fabrication, morphologies and structural characterizations of POM-GFs 3D POM-GFs were fabricated through a one-step process with simultaneous adsorption of POM, reduction of GO and self-assembly of graphene into 3D porous network at room-temperature, as depicted in Fig. 1 . Briefly, the controlled amounts of POM and N2H4 were added into a well-dispersed GO aqueous dispersion. The mixture was kept quiescent to yield mechanically strong 3D POM-GFs hydrogel. During this process, GO nanosheets were rapidly reduced and efficiently self-assembled into hydrogel with 3D interconnected macroporous network (Fig. 2 a and b), and uniformly decorated with ultrasmall POM nanoclusters (Fig. 2c). The 3D porous network morphology of as-prepared POM-GFs was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 2b). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping analysis demonstrated the coexistence of C, O, N, Mo and P in POM-GFs (Fig. 2d), and the atomic ratio of Mo:P was 11.5:1, close to the ratio of Mo:P (12:1) in POM (Fig. S1). The content of POM anchored on 3D GFs was about ~ 37.7 wt%, derived from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 2e and S2). More importantly, this low-cost strategy is highly flexible and scalable for mass production of large-pore-volume POM-GFs (Fig. S3). To illustrate the strong synergy of POM and N2H4, we carried out the control experiments using the similar procedures, without adding of POM or N2H4. In such cases, only either black aggregates or yellow solution was yielded, rather than the formation of 3D hydrogel (Fig. S4), confirming the essential of POM and N2H4 on the formation of 3D frameworks. Simultaneously, POM was found to be able to accelerate the reduction process of GO at room-temperature (Fig. 2f–h, S5, and S6). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns elucidated the complete reduction of GO in POM-GFs, while only partial reduction of GO without adding POM (rGO-R), demonstrative of the importance of POM in facilitating the reduction of GO to graphene (Fig. 2f). Further, the I D/I G ratio for POM-GFs (1.31) was significantly higher than that of rGO-R (1.05, Fig. S5), indicative of improved reduction degree of POM-GFs. This is in good agreement with the previous works of GO reduction by pyrolysis [32], laser reduction [33] and chemical reduction [34], leading to the creation of a large number of the defects at each removal site [35]. This result was further confirmed by the higher C/O ratio of 6.9 for POM-GFs than rGO-R (2.98) analyzed from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2g and S6). As expected, the POM-GFs derived compact film exhibited excellent electrical conductivity of 622 S m−1 (Fig. 2h), three orders of magnitude higher than that of rGO-R film (0.1 S m−1). It was speculated that the rapid reduction of GO was achieved by N2H4 with assistance of POM, in which POM may act as an electron acceptor or donor to enhance the reduction efficiency of N2H4 due to the excellent redox properties, as shown in Fig. S7 [36]. Specifically, the POM was firstly chemically adsorbed on GO surface to form a stable homogeneous solution by bonding with oxygen-containing functional groups, such as –COOH, –OH and –COH [27,37–40]. Then, GO was easily reduced by N2H4 due to the decreased bond energy by POM. Simultaneously, the reduced graphene would assemble into 3D interconnected hydrogel because of the π-π stacking interactions, van der Waals-interactions and hydrogen bonding [41]. During this process, POM could also bond with adjacent graphene sheets and knit them into 3D frameworks [42–44]. 2.2 Electrochemical performances of POM-GFs With the highly porous structure and excellent processability, the as-prepared POM-GFs can be directly used as free-standing conducting electrodes without adding binder and conductive additive by capillary shrinkage and compression into compact POM-GFs films (Fig. S8 and S9), achieving a high packing density of 1.68 g cm−3. The SEM images revealed that the as-prepared POM-GFs films had a rather uniform flat, highly aligned and compact layered structure (Fig. 3 a–c). Taking into account of these advantages, we evaluated the electrochemical capacitive energy storage behavior of POM-GFs films as working electrode directly, Pt foil as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode in a standard three-electrode system, in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 3d–i). It was observed that cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of POM-GFs films collected at different scan rates exhibited strong redox peaks, corresponding to three reversible multielectron-transfer reactions of the electron reservoir POM clusters (O1/R1: + 2e− + 2H+ ↔ H2P Mo 2 V Mo 10 VI O40, O2/R2: H2P Mo 2 V Mo 10 VI O40 + 2e− + 2H+ ↔ H4P Mo 4 V Mo 8 VI O40, O3/R3: H4P Mo 4 V Mo 8 VI O40 + 2e− + 2H+ ↔ H6P Mo 6 V Mo 6 VI O40) [26,45] (Fig. 3d and g). This result was also demonstrated by galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD, Fig. 3e) profiles with a pronounced potential plateau and unobservable IR drop. Furthermore, the electrochemical kinetics analysis manifested the mainly capacitive behavior in the charge storage process of POM-GFs films (Fig. S10), suggesting ultrasmall POM nanoclusters delivered the extrinsic pseudocapacitive behavior. Notably, the gravimetric capacitance obtained at scan rate of 1 mV s−1 was calculated to be 205 F g−1, corresponding to 344 F cm−3 (Fig. 3h), which was higher than the most reported GFs chemically reduced under non room-temperatures (Table S1), such as, by NaHSO3 at 95 °C (166 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1) [18], vitamin C at 40 °C (128 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) [20], phenolic acids at 95 °C (151 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) [25], and carbohydrazide at 90 °C (167 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) [15]. Additionally, this volumetric capacitance of 344 F cm−3 was well comparable to the most reported high-mass-density graphene-based electrodes fabricated by mechanical compression and/or capillary compression (Table S2), such as N- and O-rich graphene films (320 F cm−3) [46], functionalized graphene hydrogel (294 F cm−3) [47], 3D holey graphene framework (212 F cm−3) [48], activated microwave expanded graphite oxide (110 F cm−3) [49] and chemically converted graphene (256 F cm−3) [50]. Impressively, the POM-GFs films exhibited long-term cycling stability with a high capacitance retention of 83% after 10,000 cycles at current density of 12 A g−1 (Fig. 3f), which was well comparable to the most reported POM/carbon hybrids, e.g., mesoporous polypyrrole@rGO-POM (80% after 2000 cycles) [45], pinecone carbon/PMo12O40 (91% after 5000 cycles) [51], phosphomolybdate@polypyrrole (83% after 5000 cycles) [52], phosphotungstate@polypyrrole (84% after 5000 cycles) [52] and activated carbon/P2Mo18 O62 (70% after 2000 cycles) [53]. To highlight the importance of POM in the performance improvement of POM-GFs film electrodes, we also compared the electrochemical performance with the counterpart rGO-R for supercapacitors. In a sharp contrast, rGO-R electrodes delivered only electrical double layer capacitive behavior, smaller integration area in CV curves (at 5 mV s−1, Fig. 3g and S11), and shorter discharge time in GCD profiles (at 1 A g−1, Fig. S11 and S12). As a result, rGO-R yielded lower capacitance of 110 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 than POM-GFs (205 F g−1, Fig. 3h), demonstrative of the additional pseudocapacitve contribution of POM. Significantly, Nyquist plots (Fig. 3i) represented the lower charge-transfer resistance of 6.8 Ω for POM-GFs than that of rGO-R (47.5 Ω), suggestive of high electrical conductivity due to improved reduction of graphene promoted by POM. The larger slope in the low frequency range for POM-GFs is indicative of enhanced ion transfer transport due to the property of proton transport of POM [54], and anchoring POM nanoclusters as nanospacers can significantly prevent the restacking of adjacent graphene nanosheets, thus providing abundant interior spaces for charge transport and storage, resulting in the performance enhancement of POM-GFs films. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the assembly time and amount of POM for modulating the reduction degree and content of POM anchored on 3D GFs are the key factors for maximizing the performance of POM-GFs films (Fig. S13 and S14). To further demonstrate the potential in practical application, the symmetric solid-state supercapacitors (denoted as POM-GFs-SCs) were assembled based on POM-GFs film electrodes, using H2SO4/PVA gel as electrolyte (Fig. 4 a). As shown in Fig. 4b, the CV curves of POM-GFs-SCs at scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 showed a pair of distinct redox peak, leading to impressive pseudocapacitive behavior originating from redox POM clusters [45]. The GCD profiles (Fig. 4c) exhibited the triangular shapes with slight deviations, demonstrative of the combined features of electrical double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. As a result, POM-GFs-SCs offered excellent gravimetric capacitance of 157 F g−1 and volumetric capacitance of 115 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 based on single electrode (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, our POM-GFs-SCs disclosed a volumetric energy density of 2.6 mWh cm−3 (Fig. 4e), which was much higher than those of commercially available supercapacitors (2.75 V/44 mF and 5.5 V/100 mF, <1 mWh cm−3), several orders of magnitude higher than 3 V/300 μF electrolytic capacitors (<2.0 µWh cm−3), and comparable to Li thin-film batteries (4 V/500 µAh) [33,55]. Meanwhile, POM-GFs-SCs delivered an impressive volumetric power density of 398 mW cm−3 at energy density of 1.8 mWh cm−3 (Fig. 4e). In addition, the long-term stability with 89% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles was obtained for POM-GFs-SCs (Fig. 4f). 3 Conclusions In summary, we have developed a novel, low-cost and fast self-assembly strategy to produce 3D POM-GFs at room-temperature. The as-obtained POM-GFs exhibited 3D interconnected macroporous network, high electrical conductivity and exceptional processability, showing excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The POM-GFs derived film electrode exhibited high gravimetric 205 F g−1, volumetric capacitance of 344 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1 and excellent cyclability with 83% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, our POM-GFs-SCs disclosed an excellent gravimetric capacitance of 157 F g−1, volumetric capacitance of 115 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 based on single electrode and volumetric energy density of 2.6 mWh cm−3. Therefore, this room-temperature fast self-assembly strategy will provide numerous opportunities to create 3D porous GFs for high-performance supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.

        "dc:description": "Synthesis and applications of three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene frameworks (GFs) have attracted extensive interest owing to their intriguing advantages of high specific surface area, enriched porosity, excellent electrical conductivity, exceptional compressibility and processability. However, it is still challenging for economically viable, fast and scalable assembly of 3D GFs at room-temperature. Herein, we reported a one-step scalable strategy for fast self-assembly of graphene oxide into 3D macroscopically porous GFs, with assistance of polyoxometalates (POM) as functional cross-linker and hydrazine hydrate as reductant at room-temperature. The resulting 3D interconnected macroporous POM-GFs uniformly decorated with ultrasmall POM nanoclusters were directly processed into binder-/additive-free film compact electrodes (1.68 g cm−3) with highly aligned, layer-stacked structure and electrically conductivity (622 S m−1) for high-performance supercapacitors, showing an impressive gravimetric capacitance of 205 F g−1, volumetric capacitance of 334 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1, and remarkable cycling stability with capacitance retention of 83% after 10,000 cycles, outperforming the most reported GFs. Further, the solid-state supercapacitors offered excellent gravimetric capacitance of 157 F g−1, exceptionally volumetric capacitance of 115 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 based on single electrode, and volumetric energy density of 2.6 mWh cm−3. Therefore, this work will open novel opportunities to room-temperature fast assembly of 3D porous graphene architectures for high-energy–density supercapacitors.",
