Kinetic behavior of hydrogenation of aromatics in diesel fuel over silica–alumina-supported bimetallic Pt–Pd catalyst Takashi Fujikawa * Kazuo Idei Katsuyoshi Ohki Hirofumi Mizuguchi Kazushi Usui Cosmo Research Institute, 1134-2 Gongendo, Satte, Saitama 340-0193, Japan * Corresponding author. Tel.: +81-480-42-2219; fax: +81-480-42-3790 The kinetics and long-term stability test of the aromatic hydrogenation of diesel fuel were studied on SiO2–Al2O3 supported bimetallic Pt–Pd catalyst. The tests on the influence of operating parameters and kinetics studies were carried out using Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3, which provided the highest catalytic activity in a previous paper [Applied Catalysis A: General, 192 (2000) 253] with hydrotreated light cycle oil (LCO)/straight-run light gas oil (SRLGO) feedstocks containing 30vol.% aromatics/100wppm sulfur and 34vol.% aromatics/420wppm sulfur under numerous conditions. The results on this catalyst obtained at different LHSV showed an excellent fit to first-order kinetics. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 92kJ/mol. Long-term stability test demonstrated the excellent stability of this catalyst. The products during the long-term stability test are of good quality, with the upgraded color, the increased cetane index, and sufficiently decreased sulfur content. Keywords Hydrogenation Hydrodesulfurization Pt–Pd SiO2–Al2O3 Kinetics Aromatics Diesel fuel TEM 1 Introduction To reduce the environmental impact of diesel emissions, improvements in the quality of diesel fuel are required. In particular, because a high aromatic content in diesel fuel has been recognized to contribute to the formation of particulate matter (PM) in exhaust gases, much attention has been paid to the development of new catalytic technology for the reduction of aromatics in diesel fuel [1]. Thus, extensive studies have been carried out to develop sulfur-tolerant noble-metal catalysts for the two-stage hydrotreating process by a great number of researchers. Recently, noble-metal catalysts on acidic supports, such as HY zeolite [2–6], borosilicate [7], MCM-41 [8], mordenite [9], B2O3–Al2O3 [10–12] and SiO2–Al2O3 [13,14] have been reported as high sulfur-tolerant aromatic hydrogenation catalysts. In the previous reports [15,16], the authors demonstrated that Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst possesses significantly high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of aromatics in diesel fuel. The purpose of this work as a continuation of previous reports is to identify and quantify the key parameters in hydrogenation of aromatics with Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst. To understand catalyst performance under mimic industrial operating conditions, Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst was examined in reaction kinetics under various conditions. Furthermore, to investigate the stability of this catalyst and the product properties (cetane index, color and sulfur content), the extended test was carried out. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts The support material used was SiO2–Al2O3 (surface area 363m2/g). Bimetallic Pt–Pd catalyst was prepared by pore volume impregnation on supports, using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Wako Pure Chemical) and PdCl2 (Wako Pure Chemical) as the impregnating salt, in the presence of dilute hydrochloric acid. After impregnation this catalyst was dried and calcined in air at 773K for 4h. Prior to the activity test, fresh catalyst was reduced in an H2 flow at 623K for 2h. The typical chemical and physical properties of the catalyst are given in Table 1 . 2.2 Feedstock properties Feedstock for this work was prepared by mixing LCO and SRLGO obtained from Cosmo Oil Sakai refinery. LCO is a middle distillate refinery product generated in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. The mixing ratio of LCO/SRLGO in the feed oil was 30/70vol.%. Because of the high sulfur content (1.0wt.%) of LCO/SRLGO, Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 has to be used in the latter reactor of the two-stage hydrotreating process. Therefore, the LCO/SRLGO blendstock was previously hydrotreated using a Co–Mo–P/HY zeolite-alumina catalyst (C-603A of Cosmo Oil [17]) before performing the hydrogenation experiments with Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst. The general properties of the untreated and hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO feedstocks are given in Table 2 . 2.3 Activity measurements Hydrogenation runs were carried out in a bench-scale plant that contained an isothermal fixed-bed reactor operating in down-flow mode. Hydrogenation of hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO feed was carried out under the following conditions: temperature, 463–573K; total pressure, 3–6MPa; liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), 0.41–1.85h−1; hydrogen-to-feed oil ratio, 95–550Nl/l. The percentage and type of aromatics content in feed and products were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC analysis was performed using two types of detectors: ultraviolet (UV-8200, Tosoh Co.) and refractive index (RI-8200, Tosoh Co.) to measure quantitatively different types of aromatics, that is, mono, di, tri and total aromatics. The amount of sulfur was measured by a total sulfur analyzer (TS-3, Mitsubishi Kagaku) for sulfur levels below 200wppm and by an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscope (RX-600SA, Mitsubishi Kagaku) for higher sulfur contents. The cetane index was calculated by the ASTM D-976. Saybolt color was measured by oil color haze measurement equipment (OCH-300A, Nippon Densyoku). 2.4 Characterization of catalysts Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) measurements were carried out using an electron microscope (JEM-2010, JEOL), with an accelerating voltage of 200keV. The reduced and used samples were finely ground, suspended in acetone, and then placed on a collodion film mounted on a specimen grid. The average diameter of the metal particles was calculated based on the diameters of 50 particles in two arbitrarily chosen areas. For the investigation of the chemical composition of the metal particles of the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used in a TEM. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reaction kinetics of aromatic hydrogenation over Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst As mentioned in the preceding papers [15,16], among the many catalysts tested, Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 exhibits promising activity for aromatic hydrogenation of hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO feedstocks. Hence, further tests on the influence of the operating parameters and kinetics studies were carried out with Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3. After catalyst deactivation became insignificant, kinetics studies of aromatic hydrogenation were conducted under various conditions as follows. 3.1.1 Effect of LHSV The activity measurements of Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 were carried out with hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO (420wppm sulfur) at constant temperature and pressure but at different LHSV. For the first-order kinetics of hydrogenation reaction, the rate can be described as: ln C f C p = k LHSV where k is rate constant/h, C f is the amount of aromatics in feedstock and C p is amount of aromatics in product. Fitting the experimental data of this study to this equation, good linearity of the plot of 1/LHSV versus ln (C f/C p) confirmed the validity of the first-order kinetic model in Fig. 1 . On the other hand, Cooper et al. [18] reported finding zero-order kinetics for the hydrogenation of industrial feedstock using a zeolite-supported noble-metal catalyst. They suggested as the reason the fact that the aromatic species adsorb strongly on the zeolite-based catalyst, so that the rate equation would be better represented by a Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW)-type of rate equation. Zeolite possesses the strong acid sites, mainly of Brønsted nature. Instead, SiO2–Al2O3 shows a weak and medium strength of acidity with a large amount of Lewis acid sites [19]. We assumed that, since the acid strength of SiO2–Al2O3 is weaker than that of zeolite, aromatic hydrogenation on Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst is not inhibited by adsorption of unconverted aromatics and is thus governed by a first order rate equation. 3.1.2 Effect of temperature To calculate the apparent activation energy, the activity measurements of Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 were carried out with hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO (420wppm sulfur) at constant LHSV and pressure but at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2 , the apparent activation energy calculated from the slope is 92kJ/mol. This value is very similar to 96kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of naphthalene on sulfided NiMo catalyst [20]. On the other hand, Corma et al. [8] reported that apparent activation energies fall in the range of 95–115kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of naphthalene on Pt supported on amorphous SiO2–Al2O3, mesoporous SiO2–Al2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2 supports, but 65kJ/mol on Pt supported on HY zeolite. They suggest that the lower apparent activation energy for the hydrogenation over Pt/HY catalyst is probably responsible for a stronger adsorption of the aromatics on the Brønsted acid sites of the HY zeolite. The differences of activation energies are not easily explainable but may be due to differences in acidity between SiO2–Al2O3 and HY zeolite. From the results of the reaction order in Section 3.1.1 and activation energy in this section, we conclude that the acidic properties of the Pt–Pd catalysts play an important role in the kinetic behavior of aromatic hydrogenation. 3.1.3 Effect of the hydrogen pressure and the hydrogen-to-feed oil ratio Since the rate equation for representing the kinetics of aromatic hydrogenation using industrial feedstock is very complicated, it is difficult to fix many coefficients [1]. Thus, from a practical point of view, a simple power law expression has been extensively used to quantify the kinetic parameters in chemical and petroleum refining industries. The equilibrium constant for hydrogenation reaction of aromatics: Aromatics+H 2→Saturates strongly depends on the hydrogen pressure and the hydrogen concentration. In the case of the operating conditions at the higher hydrogen pressure and/or the higher hydrogen concentration, it seems that the equilibrium shifts in favor of the forward reaction. Therefore, in order to find the appropriate operating conditions, it is important to determine the coefficients of the hydrogen pressure and the hydrogen concentration in the following rate equation: k∝(hydrogen pressure)α×(hydrogen−to−feed oil ratio)β Activity measurements were carried out with hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO (420wppm sulfur) to determine the power term of hydrogen pressure and hydrogen-to-feed oil ratio. The results are shown in Fig. 3 A and B. It was concluded that the reaction was in the order of 1.4 in hydrogen pressure and 0.8 in hydrogen-to-feed oil ratio. For instance, from these results, it is estimated that the hydrogenation pressure required to manufacture the diesel fuel with 15vol.% aromatics under the operating conditions (LHSV, 1.5h−1; hydrogen-to-feed oil ratio, 500Nl/l; temperature 573K) is 6.7MPa for hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO (420wppm sulfur). 3.1.4 Inhibiting effect of H2S partial pressure on aromatic hydrogenation The inhibiting effect of H2S on the catalytic activity of Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 was investigated in order to understand the origin of the high activity of the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3catalyst in detail. As shown in Fig. 4 , the catalytic activity of Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 was significantly decreased by the introduction of H2S during the hydrogenation reaction. However, the decreased activity was almost regenerated after cutting off H2S. Barbier et al. [21] reported that two different types of sulfur, that is, ‘reversible sulfur’ and ‘irreversible sulfur’ could exist on the surface of sulfur-poisoned noble-metal catalysts. Because the activity was restored after cutting off H2S, it seems that H2S is easily desorbed in a hydrogen atmosphere. Thus, it is clear that H2S is reversibly adsorbed on the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst in this case. Probably, the adsorption of H2S on the active sites leads to strong competitive adsorption with the aromatic compounds and contributes to the significant decrease of hydrogenation reaction rate. In agreement with this work, Marchal et al. [22] have reported reversibility of sulfur poisoning by adding dibenzothiophene for a noble-metal catalyst. 3.2 Product properties during long-term stability test of Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst To demonstrate the high stability of the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst, an extended test was carried out in the bench-scale plant with hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO (100wppm sulfur). The results obtained for hydrogenation are shown in Fig. 5 . Each plot shows the temperature required for maintaining 20vol.% aromatics in the product. An interesting feature is that the hydrogenation activity during the initial period of time on stream was significantly deactivated, since then, the activity was maintained at a fairly constant level for a period of 6000h. To understand the reason of the initial deactivation of the Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst, the average diameter of the metal particles with time on stream was measured with TEM. EDS measurements indicated that both Pt and Pd were detected on the metal particles [15]. The results are shown in Table 3 , indicating that the average diameter of the metal particles increases with time on stream. Because hydrogenation is a structure-insensitive reaction [23,24], the lower the dispersion of active metal becomes, the lower the hydrogenation activity becomes. Thus, it may be assumed that the deactivation in the early stages can be attributed to the agglomeration of active metal (Pt–Pd) on the catalyst. This result of our experiment is quite contrary to the proposal by Yasuda and Yoshimura [6], who assumed that the deactivation of Pt–Pd/HY zeolite catalyst for tetralin hydrogenation was due to the poisoning of metals by sulfur, and that the influence of agglomeration of metals on the deactivation was small. According to their results, when the sulfur compounds were not present in feedstock, deactivation was not observed. Thus, in order to elucidate the reason of the initial rapid deactivation in our case, it is necessary to investigate the possibility that sulfur compounds in feedstocks and/or H2S gas accelerate the agglomeration of Pt–Pd active metals. The saybolt color, the cetane index and the sulfur content of the product oil with time on stream were also investigated during the long-term stability test. As shown in Fig. 6 A–C, the products are of good quality, with the upgraded color, the increased cetane index, and sufficiently decreased sulfur content. In particular, Fig. 6C shows that it is possible to achieve 50 wppm sulfur (ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization). The current literature agrees with our results: Reinhoudt and co-workers [25–27] reported that amorphous SiO2–Al2O3 supported noble-metal (Pt and/or Pd) catalysts have a promising potential for ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization processing. When hydrotreating to ultra low sulfur levels, it is necessary to remove refractory sulfur containing compounds, such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene. It seems that the high hydrogenation activity of the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst practically decreases the steric hindrance by methyl substituents on the 4- and 6-position of dibenzothiophene and promotes the hydrodesulfurization reaction. 4 Conclusions The kinetics and long-term stability test of the hydrogenation of aromatics were studied in hydrotreated LCO/SRLGO feedstocks containing ca. 30vol.% aromatics/100wppm sulfur and 34vol.% aromatics/420wppm sulfur using the Pt (0.5wt.%)–Pd (1.0wt.%)/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst. There are five main conclusions, as listed below: 1. The results on this catalyst obtained at different LHSV showed an excellent fit to first order kinetics. 2. The apparent activation energy was determined to be 92kJ/mol. 3. The long-term stability tests demonstrated the excellent stability of the Pt–Pd/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst. 4. The products during long-term stability test have good quality: sulfur content has sufficiently decreased, the color has upgraded, and the cetane index has increased. 5. This catalyst could practically achieve 50wppm sulfur (ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization).
