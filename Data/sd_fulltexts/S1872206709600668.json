DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(09)60066-8 Highly Efficient Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 Catalyst for Pre-reforming of Liquefied Petroleum Gas under a Low Molar Ratio of Steam to Carbon LI Lin, WANG Xueguang*, SHEN Kui, ZOU Xiujing, LU Xionggang, DING Weizhong # Shanghai Key Laboratory of Modern Metallurgy and Material Processing, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200072, China Abstract: The pre-reforming of commercial liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) over Ni-based catalysts at a low steam to carbon molar ratio was investigated. Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating boehmite with an aqueous solution of cerium and nickel nitrates. These catalysts were found to be highly efficient in LPG pre-reforming at 300–400 °C and a low molar ratio of steam to carbon of 1.0. The effect of nickel content and reaction temperature on the performance of the Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts was evaluated and the 15%Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst was selected for a stability test in the pre-reforming of LPG. The results showed that the conversion of LPG and the composition of the products in the exit gas were almost unchanged for the steam reforming of commercial LPG after about 105 h of reaction time on stream at 350 °C and GHSV of the inlet gas of 3 000 ml/(g·h) with a steam to carbon molar ratio of 1.0, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent stability. After the reaction, no obvious carbon was observed on the catalyst surface. Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts show good catalytic performance for the low temperature steam reforming of LPG, which may potentially be used in commercial fuel cells. Key words: nickel; ceria; alumina; supported catalyst; liquefied petroleum gas; pre-reforming Hydrogen is the preferred feedstock for use in the present generation of fuel cells because of its high electrochemical reactivity and non-polluting characteristics [1–3]. Hydrogen is presently produced mainly through the steam reforming of natural gas [4–6]. Facilities for hydrogen production need to be constructed near natural gas pipelines because the storage and transportation of liquefied natural gas require a large en- ergy input. However, infrastructure for the distribution of natural gas is currently lacking, especially in less densely populated areas. There is an urgent demand for an alternative energy source for hydrogen production [7–10]. Liquid hydrocarbons such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are cheap and readily accessible and are a potential source of low cost hydrogen for fuel cells because the distribution infra- structure for these fuels is extensive. However, the deactivation of reforming catalysts is a major problem that arises from coke formation during the thermal or steam cracking of hydrocar- bons at high temperatures [11,12]. An effective approach is to first perform low temperature steam reforming (or pre-re- forming) to convert higher hydrocarbons to methane, hydro- gen, and carbon oxides followed by the high temperature re- forming of the reformate into hydrogen and carbon oxides at temperatures above 700 °C [13,14]. The pre-reforming of LPG is usually performed at 400–500 °C and with a steam/carbon molar ratio (S/C) range as high as 2.5–4.0 to mostly prevent the formation of carbonaceous de- posits on the catalyst [15]. However, it is desirable to operate the reaction under a low S/C and low temperatures to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the size of the fuel processor. Recently, it has been reported that Ru- and Pt-based catalysts have excellent resistance to carbon deposition in the pre-reforming of propane and LPG under a low S/C [16,17]. In this communication, we first report that Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts can fully convert LPG into CH 4 , H 2 , and carbon oxides LI Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 525–527 (CO x ) and that they show excellent stability at low tempera- tures and a S/C of 1.0. The Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating boehmite (AlOOH) powder with an aqueous solution of cerium nitrate (≥ 99.0%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) and nickel nitrate (≥ 99.0%, Sinopharm Chemical Re- agent Co., Ltd., China) and the catalyst contained 10% CeO 2 (mass fraction). Boehmite was obtained by calcining SB pseudoboehmite powder (from Condea, Germany) at 500 °C. The Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 mixture was heated at 80 °C and then dried at 110 °C overnight. The obtained solid was then calcined at 800 °C for 6 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and tem- perature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) (not shown) showed that a spinel structure NiAl 2 O 4 and the CeO 2 phases formed and there was no free NiO species in the Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts. All the Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts had higher BET specific sur- face areas in the range of 100–130 m 2 /g with average pore sizes of ca. 13 nm. The pre-reforming reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a flow fixed-bed reactor. Commercially available auto LPG was purchased from BP (Shanghai) LPG Co. Ltd, and consisted of 3.1% C 2 H 6 , 84.0% C 3 H 8 , and 12.9% C 4 H 10 (volume fraction). This gas was used without further purifica- tion. Before testing, the catalysts were reduced in a flow of 15% H 2 -85% N 2 (V/V, 50 ml/min) at 800 °C for 5 h. Table 1 shows LPG conversions for the different catalysts at 350 °C and a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of inlet gas = 1 500 ml/(g·h) (STP) with S/C = 1.0. The CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst did not reform the LPG while all the Ni-based catalysts converted LPG to some extent. This suggests that nickel is the active compo- nent for the steam reforming of LPG. For Ni/Al 2 O 3 or Ni/CeO 2 catalysts, the conversions of LPG were 2.5% and 8.5%, re- spectively. When 10% CeO 2 was added to the Ni/Al 2 O 3 cata- lysts, the conversion of LPG increased dramatically and finally reached 100% with a Ni content of 10%. These results indicate that CeO 2 significantly improves the catalytic performance of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the pre-reforming of LPG and this is likely due to an increase in the water adsorption ability of the support and the enhancement of oxygen mobility [18–20]. The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic per- formance of pre-reforming LPG at a GHSV of inlet gas = 1 500 ml/(g·h) and a S/C = 1.0 over the 15%Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst is listed in Table 2. The catalyst showed excellent activity at 300–400 °C. The conversion of LPG increased from 91.4% to 100% by elevating the reaction temperature from 300 to 350 °C, indicating that the higher temperature favored the conversion of LPG into light gas molecules. A thermodynamic equilibrium analysis showed that the steam reforming of all higher hydrocarbons (n ≥ 2) (Eq. (1)) can be considered irre- versible under the present operation conditions, namely, the conversion of LPG is 100% when the reaction system reaches chemical equilibrium between 300 and 400 °C. This implies that the catalytic reforming of LPG is governed by reaction kinetics below 350 °C. The CO x selectivity increased with an increase in the reaction temperature, while CH 4 selectivity decreased. This is due to the exothermic nature of the methanation of CO x and H 2 (Eqs. (2) and (3)). C n H m + H 2 O → CO x + H 2 ∆H(25 o C) > 0 (n ≥ 2 and x = 1 or 2) (1) CO + 3H 2 ↔ CH 4 + H 2 O ∆H(25 o C) = – 205.9 kJ/mol (2) CO 2 + 4H 2 ↔ CH 4 + 2H 2 O ∆H(25 o C) = – 164.7 kJ/mol (3) CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2 ∆H(25 o C) = – 41.1 kJ/mol (4) A comparison between the experimental results and the equilibrium values (Table 2) showed that on the basis of LPG and H 2 O content in the feed, the selectivities for CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 in the exit gas were almost close to the corresponding theoretical values within the GC error range. The equilibrium of the methanation reactions and the water gas shift reaction (Eq. (4)) could thus be established over the whole temperature range. The reaction conditions (GHSV = 3 000 ml/(g·h) (STP) and S/C = 1.0) with an ca. 99% initial conversion of LPG over the 15%Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 350 °C were selected to exam- ine catalyst stability during the pre-reforming of LPG. Figure 1 shows the conversion of LPG and the product composition as a function of reaction time over the catalyst.

LI Lin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 525–527 period of ca. 105 h, the catalyst was stable in terms of activity and the conversion of LPG was constant. The compositions of H 2 , CO, CO 2 , and CH 4 were also constant at ca. 16.5%, 0.2%, 17.3%, and 66.0%, respectively. It has been established that carbon deposition is mainly responsible for the deactivation of Ni-based catalysts during the reforming of hydrocarbons [21]. After this reaction, however, no obvious carbon deposition was observed on the catalyst surface. This was confirmed by a XRD analysis of the used catalyst (no shown) as there was no peak at ca. 26.2° corresponding to graphite carbon (PDF 26-1080). In summary, the developed Ni/CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst pos- sesses high catalytic activity and good long term stability for the low temperature steam reforming of LPG at a low steam/carbon molar ratio of 1.0, while maintaining excellent catalytic performance. This catalyst is promising for the pre-reforming of higher hydrocarbons and can be applied to fuel cells. References 1 Clarke S H, Dicks A L, Pointon K, Smith T A, Swann A.

        "dc:description": "The pre-reforming of commercial liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) over Ni-based catalysts at a low steam to carbon molar ratio was investigated. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating boehmite with an aqueous solution of cerium and nickel nitrates. These catalysts were found to be highly efficient in LPG pre-reforming at 300–400°C and a low molar ratio of steam to carbon of 1.0. The effect of nickel content and reaction temperature on the performance of the Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts was evaluated and the 15%Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was selected for a stability test in the pre-reforming of LPG. The results showed that the conversion of LPG and the composition of the products in the exit gas were almost unchanged for the steam reforming of commercial LPG after about 105 h of reaction time on stream at 350°C and GHSV of the inlet gas of 3∼000 ml/(g·h) with a steam to carbon molar ratio of 1.0, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent stability. After the reaction, no obvious carbon was observed on the catalyst surface. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts show good catalytic performance for the low temperature steam reforming of LPG, which may potentially be used in commercial fuel cells.",
