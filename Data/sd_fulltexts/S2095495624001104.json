Graphical abstract The heterogeneous electrocatalyst seed Li2S2/Li2S through sulphifilic active sites, while the homogeneous electrocatalyst releases soluble lithium polyselenides to propagate Li2S2/Li2S via solution pathways. Expediting redox kinetics of sulfur species on conductive scaffolds with limited charge accessible surface is considered as an imperative approach to realize energy-dense and power-intensive lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries. In this work, the concept of concurrent hetero-/homo-geneous electrocatalysts is proposed to simultaneously mediate liquid–solid conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and solid lithium disulfide/sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S) propagation, the latter of which suffers from sluggish reduction kinetics due to buried conductive scaffold surface by extensive deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. The selected model material to verify this concept is a two-in-one catalyst: carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold supported iron-cobalt (Fe-Co) alloy nanoparticles and partially carbonized selenium (C-Se) component. The Fe-Co alloy serves as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst to seed Li2S2/Li2S through sulphifilic active sites, while the C-Se sustainably releases soluble lithium polyselenides and functions as a homogeneous electrocatalyst to propagate Li2S2/Li2S via solution pathways. Such bi-phasic mediation of the sulfur species benefits reduction kinetics of LiPS conversion, especially for the massive Li2S2/Li2S growth scenario by affording an additional solution directed route in case of conductive surface being largely buried. This strategy endows the Li–S batteries with improved cycling stability (836 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles), rate capability (547 mA h g−1 at 4 C) and high sulfur loading superiority (2.96 mA h cm−2 at 2.4 mg cm−2). This work hopes to enlighten the employment of bi-phasic electrocatalysts to dictate liquid–solid transformation of intermediates for conversion chemistry batteries. Keywords Lithium-sulfur batteries Electrocatalysis Lithium polysulfides Sulfur cathode Energy density 1 Introduction Electrocatalysis is a widely used approach to regulate charge transfer under electric field by mediators loaded on the electrode surface or dispersed in the solution/gas phase [1,2]. The former fashion is heterogeneous electrocatalysis (he-catal) that refers to a catalytic reaction occurring at the catalyst interface when the catalyst and the reactant are in different phases. The latter is regarded as homogeneous electrocatalysis (ho-catal) in case the catalyst and the reactant are in the same phase. The major features of he-catal are mobile reaction products, such as liquids [3,4] and gases [5] to avoid the burying and deactivation of electrocatalysts. Typical examples include reduction of CO2 to CO [6], oxygen reduction reaction [7,8] and hydrogen evolution reaction [9,10]. The ho-catal has the merit of consistently catalyzing reactants even if the solid-state products are generated from liquid or gas reactants [11]. Beyond the scope of he-catal or ho-catal in water splitting [12], wastewater treatment [13], and petroleum refining [14], the advanced battery chemistry that relies on dissolution and deposition mechanisms urgently requires both he-catal or ho-catal to regulate the multi-phase intermediates to boost electrochemical reaction kinetics and prevent deactivation of active sites. Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries exhibit a prospect for energy demanding applications due to their exciting theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg−1), low cost and environmental friendliness [15–20]. The operation of Li–S batteries in aprotic electrolytes adopts the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and deposition of lithium disulfide/sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S), manifesting a typical solid–liquid–solid phase transformation during the electrochemical reactions [21–23]. Propelling the liquid–solid sulfur species conversion kinetics is kernel to obtain desired rate capability and cyclability for Li–S batteries, especially in high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte scenarios, which are prone to hide conductive surface and arrest cells at early discharge profile [24–27]. To this end, the concept of electrocatalysis has been introduced into Li–S batteries to accelerate the liquid–solid conversion of LiPSs and prolong Li–S battery operations [28–30]. Rational selection of electrocatalysts has been the research frontier to deal with the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics [31,32]. The concept of he-/ho-catal is applicable in Li–S batteries as they essentially share the same characteristics to other electrochemical fields [33,34]. A variety of inorganic nano-materials that are loaded on cathode scaffolds are generally regarded as heterogeneous electrocatalysts, such as sulfides [35–37], nitrides [38–40], phosphides [41,42] and their heterostructures [43,44], while homogeneous electrocatalysts that can be dissolved or dispersed in electrolytes have also been resorted to mediate LiPS evolution, as recently being proposed cobaltocene [45], di-t-butyl disulfide [46,47], diphenyl diselenide [48] and selenium-doped poly(diallyl tetrasulfide) [49,50]. Heterogeneous electrocatalysts perform well in Li2S2/Li2S nucleation and reducing the kinetic barrier of initial liquid–solid conversion due to sulphific adsorption. However, the effectiveness of heterogeneous electrocatalysts is mitigated and eventually de-activated by the burying of their active sites during Li2S2/Li2S propagation. This issue can be, at least partially, tackled by incorporating homogeneous electrocatalysts that transfer electron/ion through solution media, independent on conductive substrate properties [48,51]. Combining the merits of he-/ho-catal in Li–S batteries provides an alternative concept to mediate Li2S2/Li2S nucleation and subsequent propagation in energy-dense Li–S batteries [52]. A body of works have deployed he-catal or ho-catal in Li–S batteries, and several recent works also resort to dual mediation pathways by integrating different solid and liquid mediators to propel LiPS redox kinetics [53,54]. However, a handful of reports attempt to adopt a two-in-one material that concurrently exerts hetero-/homo-geneous electrocatalysts to bi-phasically mediate sulfur species for Li–S batteries. The superiority of the two-in-one material lies in (i) easy incorporation of electrocatalysts in electrode and (ii) sustainable release of homogeneous species to avoid pronounced migration of the homogeneous species. In this work, the concept of simultaneous integration of he-/ho-catal into Li–S batteries is verified by the employment of a model cathode scaffold, namely iron-cobalt (Fe-Co) alloy nanoparticles and partially carbonized selenium (C-Se) that are both embedded on carbon nanotube (CNT), forming a unique two-in-one model material (Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT). The motivations of taking this model material are three aspects. Firstly, Fe-Co alloy has been demonstrated to effectively promote the growth of CNT with desired length and electrical conductivity [55]. The in-situ Fe-Co nanoparticles embedded into CNT scaffold benefit the adhesion of active sites on CNT, instead of conventional mixture of electrocatalysts and substrates, which suffers from breakdown of electron pathways due to the detachment of active sites from conductive substrates [56]. Moreover, the Fe-Co nanoparticles help to seed Li2S2/Li2S through sulphifilic active sites (Fig. 1 (i)). Secondly, the Se component can be sustainably released from the C-Se component into the electrolyte during the battery operation. The soluble Se species have been, experimentally and theoretically, demonstrated to serve as homogeneous electrocatalysts to mediate LiPS deposition [47]. The small amount yet sustainable release of Se is considered critical in this design, as massive existence of Se species cause severe shuttle effect analogue to LiPSs (Fig. 1(ii)). Thirdly, the continuous release of the Se component leads to the etching of parent Fe-Co-Se nanoparticles, resulting in dynamic enhancement of the active sites on the heterogeneous electrocatalysts, which impart greater catalytic effects on LiPS conversion. These three merits of the Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT scaffold endow it as an appealing model material to prove the concept of synergizing he-/ho-catal in Li–S batteries. To simplify expression in the current work, Fe-Co@CNT refers to he-catal while Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT refers to he-/ho-catal. The concept of concurrent he-/ho-catal is expected to enlighten bi-phasic regulation of LiPSs based on both conductive surface and electrolyte medium pathways to promote the sulfur species redox kinetics. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of the Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT model material Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT was synthesized by gravity guided chemical vapor deposition strategy [55]. The growth of CNTs is considered as a gravity guided mechanism, which accounts for some Fe-Co nanoparticles located at the end of CNTs (Fig. 2 a), as demonstrated by the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HADDF-STEM) image. The element distribution of Fe/Co/Se is confirmed by energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS), revealing that Se is uniformly dispersed on CNT and Fe-Co alloy, while Fe and Co are more concentrated due to the alloy formation. Except the terminal nanoparticles on CNT, the bridge Fe-Co nanoparticles attached on CNT scaffold are also identified, forming a unique bamboo-shaped structure (Fig. 2b). This bamboo-shaped architectures bound together to constitute a flexible (accommodation of sulfur volume change) and high-specific-surface-area (16.6 m2 g−1, shown in Supporting Information (SI) Fig. S1) scaffold. Their phase identities are fingerprinted as a composite of Co3Fe7 alloy and CSe2 (Fig. 2c) with a small amount of unidentified phases, implying that Fe-Co and C-Se are a non-stoichiometric compound with plenty of defects and that Se strongly and chemically binds on CNTs instead of loosely and physically absorbing on CNT, with latter being easily peeling off. Generally, the Fe-Co&C-Se@CNT model material has two benefits: (i) the exceptional length-diameter ratio favors long-range electron transport and diminishes the contact resistance that is encountered for spherical or irregular carbon particles [57]; (ii) such dispersed Fe-Co and C-Se components on CNT skeleton afford vast active sites to electrocatalytically promote LiPS conversion [58]. 2.2 Redox kinetics of LiPSs enabled by he-/ho-catal Chiang and co-workers developed a potentialstatic approach to quantify the efficiency of liquid–solid conversion of LiPSs, which is closely linked to nucleation density, charge access capability, and LiPS-substrate affinity [59]. The Fe-Co and C-Se components have a favorable affinity toward LiPSs, as demonstrated by static macroscopic absorption that shows a de-coloration of LiPS containing electrolyte (Fig. S2). The regions of Fe-Co and C-Se components contacting with CNT scaffold serve as a beneficial triple-phase boundary (electrolyte phase, conductive carbon phase, and Fe/Co/Se nucleation phase) to mediate Li2S2/Li2S nucleation, which realize he-catal in LiPS conversion. The lithiation of Se during discharge gives rise to the partial Se dissolution by the formation of soluble lithium polyselenides (LiPSes), which functions as a ho-catal in the solution phase to accelerate LiPS conversion, especially for the Li2S4 to Li2S2 process. The sustainable release of Se is verified by cycling Li–S cells with he-/ho-catal electrode. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used to quantify the dissolution of Se in electrolyte, and it suggests that the Se content in electrolyte does not exhibit significant fluctuation, with a Se dissolution presentation of ∼10% (Fig. S3) across the tested cycle number. Although the moveable Se species may migrate toward and react with Li anode, the sustainable release of Se from the he-/ho-catal composite supplements the consumed Se. The mechanism of LiPSes to promote LiPS reduction is principally ascribed to the slightly lower discharge plateau of liquid LiPSes to solid Li2Se2/Li2Se conversion (∼1.90 V vs. Li+/Li) [60,61] than that of the dissolved LiPSs to solid Li2S2/Li2S conversion (∼2.05 V vs. Li+/Li) [62]. In the threshold of phase conversion of sulfur species (∼2.05 V vs. Li+/Li), the dissolved LiPSes with better rheological property have more probability to transfer electron and Li+ to LiPSs through the solution phase, facilitating the additional growth of Li2S2/Li2S even in the limit conductive substrates and thus achieving greater capacity (Fig. 3 a). The above assumption raises a critical issue: what are thermodynamic origins that drive the conversion of Li2S4 to Li2S2 through LiPSe redox? Under this consideration, computational efforts are devoted to revealing the root causes that Li2S4 species are possible to obtain electrons through solution-mediated pathways. According to the energetic calculation of converting Li2S6 to Li2S4 and further to Li2S2, the Gibbs free energies (ΔG) are 0.17 and −0.24 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b), which signify a spontaneous behavior during the electrochemical reduction of Li2S4 to Li2S2. At first glance, this result is quite deviated from experimental evidences that reduction of Li2S4 to Li2S2 is kinetically sluggish and even suffers from early cell arrest under high current rate or starved electrolyte. The computational results that is controversial to experimental phenomenon are attributed to the lack of consideration of electron resistance during Li2S4 reduction process. In the practical discharge event, once the conductive surface of carbon substrates is covered by insulating Li2S2/Li2S, the electron transport is blocked and then Li2S4 reduction is ceased. In the solid–liquid conversion plateau for LiPSs at ∼2.05 V, the LiPSes exist in the liquid phase, corresponding to the nominal Li2Se5 and Li2Se6 species [61,63]. The lithiation and reduction of Li2Se5 and Li2Se6 driven by external current of cell lead to the dynamic equilibria of Li3Se6 ↔ Li2Se6 + e− + Li+ and Li3Se5 ↔ Li2Se5 + e− + Li+, giving rise to the ΔG of −0.25 and −0.16 eV, respectively, when the equations move forward right. Therefore, two negative values of ΔG for equilibria are obtained, namely release of electrons from LiPSes species and acceptance of electrons for Li2S4, suggesting that transferring electrons from LiPSes to Li2S4 is thermodynamically favorable (Fig. 3c). The thermodynamic promise of converting Li2S4 to Li2S2 by ho-cata assistance implies the possibly of kinetic superiorities in Li2S2 propagation. Therefore, the benefit of concurrent he-/ho-catal is evidenced by larger capacity of Li2S2/Li2S deposition (266.3 mA h g−1) comparing with neat carbon fiber electrode (198.6 mA h g−1) and solely he-catal electrode (231.4 mA h g−1), and is also visually ascertained by SEM images after 5000 s (the insets Fig. 3d), featuring a flake-like three-dimensional structure that is expected to maintain extended conductive surface to avoid early cell death. The greater Li2S2/Li2S deposition capacity regulated by he-/ho-catal corresponds to rapid reduction kinetics of sulfur species in both solution and surface pathways, which can be characterized by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement with high scanning rate (50 mV s−1) in a symmetric cell. The model materials are loaded on carbon paper (CP) to be used as electrodes, and nominal Li2S6 containing solution is applied as catholyte. The he-/ho-catal electrode delivers a higher current at a given voltage (Fig. S4), revealing the improved redox kinetics compared with he-catal and CP electrodes. Moreover, the reduction kinetics is proofed by a precise control of potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (Fig. S5a), which explicitly describes LiPSs conversion, especially from low-order LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S that is the kinetic limitation process. The he-/ho-catal electrode shows a pronounced nucleation peak with 715 s ahead in comparison with neat electrode at the potential of 2.05 V (Fig. S5b). The Li2S2/Li2S deposition capacity (Fig. S5c) for he-/ho-catal electrode is also profoundly greater in this voltage range, indicating favorable Li2S2/Li2S nucleation and rapid low-order LiPS conversion kinetics, unequivocally verifying the critical role of the concurrent he-/ho-catal played in promoting the LiPSs redox kinetics. 2.3 Electrochemical performances To verify the concurrent he-/ho-catal that benefit in Li–S batteries, the as-prepared materials were infiltrated on a polypropylene (PP) membrane, with a functional layer loading of 0.20 mg cm−2 (Fig. S6). The sulfur content in the entire cathode side (including the functional layer on separator and cathode layer on aluminum foil) is ∼54 wt.%. The functional layer on PP does not interfere ionic conductivity across the separator (0.93 × 10−3 S cm−1 for he-/ho-catal vs. 1.00 × 10−3 S cm−1 for PP, as shown in Fig. S7), while gifts an additional benefit of wettability, with contact angle of 12 ° for he-/ho-catal vs. 22 ° for PP, Fig. S8). These advantages collectively reduce the interfacial impedance and accelerate the transport of Li ions. This assumption is supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests at a scan rate of 0.05 mV S−1 (Fig. S9). For the discharge process, two cathodic waves are observed at 2.2–2.4 and 2.0–2.1 V and represent stepwise reduction of S to Li2S. The concurrent he-/ho-catal cell shows higher cathodic and anodic peaks than the neat cell (Fig. S9). With the aid of these merits, the cell with he-/ho-catal achieves larger discharge capacities of 1147, 970, 816, 766, 697 and 547 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 C (1 C = 1675 mA g−1) than those of the neat cell, respectively (Fig. 4 a). It is noted that the second discharge plateau of the he-/ho-catal enabled electrode is much longer (Fig. 4b) than the neat electrode, especially at the high current rate of 4 C, in which the second discharge plateau is absent for the neat electrode (Fig. S10). The increase in internal resistance of the neat electrode due to sluggish reduction kinetics accounts for the gradual increase of voltage gap (Fig. 4c) and thus inferior rate capability. The concurrent he-/ho-catal enabled cell not only favors the rate capability, but also is expected to improve the long-term cyclability. The cell with the he-/ho-catal shows an enhanced capacity retention, maintaining 836 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles, higher than the he-catal enabled cell (650 mA h g−1) and the neat cell (446 mA h g−1) (Fig. 4d). The improved cyclability and Coulombic efficiency of the he-/ho-catal cell are majorly rooted to enhanced the redox kinetics and suppressed shuttle effect (Fig. S11) [64]. It is speculated that further engineering the cathode species (e.g. porosity, biner and conductors) and electrolyte recipes will definitely encourage better cycling performance with the help of the he-/ho-catal. Herein, as a demonstration of the proof of the concept, the electrode with relatively higher sulfur loading (2.4 mg cm−2) is performed (Fig. 4e). After 300 cycles, the he-/ho-catal enabled cell still remains a capacity of 1.94 mA h cm−2 with a cyclic decay rate of 0.34%. Certainly, the stable operation of the Li–S cell with high areal sulfur loading and lean electrolyte heavily relies on the protection of lithium metal anode [65–69] and optimization of electrolyte formulation [70–72]. 3 Conclusions Propelling sulfur redox kinetics in limited conductive surface is indispensable to achieve reliable Li–S batteries in case the deposition of Li2S2/Li2S heavily buries the sulfur scaffolds. Herein, we propose a concept of concurrent hetero-/homo-geneous electrocatalyst in aprotic Li–S batteries to circumvent the dilemma. This concept is realized by a two-in-one catalyst that simultaneously exert favorable triple-phase boundary (heterogenous sites) and facile solution (heterogenous media) pathways to bi-phasically regulate the seeding and propagating of Li2S2/Li2S. The sulphifilic active sites of Fe-Co alloy and sustainably released lithium polyselenides from C-Se respectively serve as heterogenous and homogeneous catalysts. Such reasonable material design uniquely endows solid sulfur species with tunable nucleation and growth, thus contributing to improved rate (547 mA h g−1 at 4 C), cyclic (836 mA h g−1 after 180), and high sulfur loading (2.96 mA h cm−2 at 2.4 mg cm−2) performances. This strategy would be extended to other battery systems that rely on the dissolution and deposition mechanisms in order to expedite the liquid/solid kinetics by using advanced bi-phasically regulating intermediates.

        "dc:description": "Expediting redox kinetics of sulfur species on conductive scaffolds with limited charge accessible surface is considered as an imperative approach to realize energy-dense and power-intensive lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries. In this work, the concept of concurrent hetero-/homo-geneous electrocatalysts is proposed to simultaneously mediate liquid–solid conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and solid lithium disulfide/sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S) propagation, the latter of which suffers from sluggish reduction kinetics due to buried conductive scaffold surface by extensive deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. The selected model material to verify this concept is a two-in-one catalyst: carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold supported iron-cobalt (Fe-Co) alloy nanoparticles and partially carbonized selenium (C-Se) component. The Fe-Co alloy serves as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst to seed Li2S2/Li2S through sulphifilic active sites, while the C-Se sustainably releases soluble lithium polyselenides and functions as a homogeneous electrocatalyst to propagate Li2S2/Li2S via solution pathways. Such bi-phasic mediation of the sulfur species benefits reduction kinetics of LiPS conversion, especially for the massive Li2S2/Li2S growth scenario by affording an additional solution directed route in case of conductive surface being largely buried. This strategy endows the Li–S batteries with improved cycling stability (836 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles), rate capability (547 mA h g−1 at 4 C) and high sulfur loading superiority (2.96 mA h cm−2 at 2.4 mg cm−2). This work hopes to enlighten the employment of bi-phasic electrocatalysts to dictate liquid–solid transformation of intermediates for conversion chemistry batteries.",
