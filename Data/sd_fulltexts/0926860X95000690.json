The activity of the NiS/ SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst was two times higher than that of USY in hydrogen atmosphere. Also USY hybrid catalysts containing NiS/A1203, NiS/TiO2 and MoSz/AI203 showed high activity for toluene disproportionation. The amount of deposited coke on NiS/SiOz, USY zeolite and NiS/SiOz-USY (USY content 50%) catalysts was 0.45, 16.1 and 7.6%, respectively, which suggests that coke deposited only on the zeolite. Although the rate of coke deposition was scarcely affected by the presence of NiS/SiO2, the deactivation rate was effectively suppressed by the presence of NiS/SiO2 and gaseous hydrogen. It was suggested that hydrogen species supplied by hydrogen spillover at NiS sites and inter-particle migration promote the turnover frequency of toluene disproportionation at Br0nsted acid sites on USY zeolite surface.

Introduction The most important characteristic of zeolites as regards catalysis is their acidity, because many reactions, such as disproportionation of alkylbenzenes, isomerization and cracking of alkanes, isomerization of alkylbenzenes, alkylation of aromatics, are catalyzed by acid sites on zeolites [ 1 ]. Disproportionation of toluene is not only an important industrial reaction but it is also used as a probe reaction to investigate the behavior of acid catalysis [2].

Yang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 115-124 mechanism [6,7] have been widely studied over various zeolites, such as Y- faujasite [8,9], mordenite [ 10,11 ], and MFI [ 12-15]. It has also been found that the addition of active metals, such as Cu, Pd, Ni and Pt to zeolite catalysts is effective in preventing activity decrease [11,16,17]. Bhavikatti and Patwardhan [ 16] found that although the initial activity of toluene disproportionation on a Ni- supported HM catalyst was lower than that on HM, the stability of NiHM was higher. Davidova et al. [ 17] claimed that the action of Ni-zeolite catalysts should be considered from three points of view (bifunctional catalysis, catalysis on the metal, and catalysis on the acidic component), which are not mutually exclusive and hence their relative effects strongly depend on the reaction conditions. The main goal of this work is to study whether and how hydrogen affects the toluene disproportionation reaction occurring on BrOnsted acid sites in zeolites by using a NiS/SiOz-USY hybrid catalysts and to clarify the effect of nickel and molybdenum sulfides and SiO2, A1203 and TiO2 supports on the reaction. 2. Experimental USY zeolite with a SIO2/A1203 mole ratio of 8 was obtained from a commercial source (supplied by Catalysts and Chemicals Ind. Co. Ltd.). NIO(2.5 Ni wt.-%)/ SiO2 was prepared by impregnating a commercially available SiO2 (Aerosil 380, BET specific surface area 380 m2 / g) with an aqueous Ni(NO3) 2 solution, followed by calcination in air at 723 K. Then NiO/SiO2 was sulfided to NiS/SiO2 with a gas mixture of H2 and H2S at 673 K. NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalysts were prepared by physically mixing NiS/SiO2 and USY zeolite in different proportions, pressing (30 MPa) into tablets without any binder and then crushing to 20-40 mesh particles. Other catalysts were prepared by a similar procedure. The reaction was run with a fixed bed continuous flow type microreactor (made of stainless steel tube, 8 mm inner diameter) apparatus under standard conditions of total pressure 1.0 MPa, molar ratio H2 (or N2) :toluene = 4:1, and a W/F= 4.6 g h/mol. The range of reaction temperatures was 623 K-723 K. Toluene was fed by a microdose pump with the carrier gas to the upper part of the reactor. The reaction products were analyzed with an on-line FID gas chromatograph using a packed column (PEG-20M). The amount of coke on the catalyst was measured with a MT-2 C.H.N element analysis recorder (Yamagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd.). 3. Results The reaction of toluene over acid zeolite catalysts gave benzene and an equilib- rium mixture of xylene isomers as the major products and small amounts of tri- methylbenzene and methylcyclohexane.

Changes of catalytic activity with time on stream and the effect of gaseous hydrogen In Fig. la are shown the changes in yields of the sum of benzene and xylene isomers (yield of toluene disproportionation product) with time on stream over SiO2-USY and NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst (USY content 50%) in the hydro- gen or nitrogen atmosphere. When the SiOz-USY hybrid catalyst was used, the decline of the disproportionation activity with time on stream was almost the same in the presence of either hydrogen or nitrogen. In this case, the activity was inde- pendent of the kind of carrier gas. When the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst was used, however, the activities exhibited large differences in hydrogen or nitrogen atmosphere. While in nitrogen atmosphere, the activity of toluene disproportiona- tion was lower than that of the SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst, the activity of NiS/ SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst was nearly 2 times higher than that of the SiO2-USY after 40 min in hydrogen atmosphere. It should also be noted that the yield of hydrogenation products (methylcyclo- hexane and its cracking products) in the toluene disproportionation system differed greatly depending on both atmosphere and catalyst, as shown in Fig. lb. On the metal-free hybrid catalyst the formation of hydrogenation product should be attrib- uted to hydrogen transfer. It may be speculated that hydrogen species which are generated on the zeolite during coke formation hydrogenate the aromatic ring of toluene. In this case, therefore, the yield of hydrogenation product is not affected by the presence of hydrogen. However, the higher hydrogenation yield on the NiS/ SiO2-USY catalyst under hydrogen atmosphere should be attributed to other rea- sons because the coke yield on this system is not higher than on the other systems, as shown in Table 1.

On the other hand, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, since the NiS/ SiOz component exhibited no catalytic activity for hydrogenation of the toluene aromatic ring, the higher hydrogenation yield can neither result from direct hydro- genation of the toluene molecule on NiS / SiO2. However, it is clear that the catalytic activity of the NiS/SiOe-USY hybrid catalyst is promoted by the existence of both NiS in the catalyst and gaseous hydrogen. Therefore, on the NiS/SiO2-USY cata- lyst hydrogen should spillover from the gas phase to the zeolite or from the zeolite surface to the gas phase. This behavior will be discussed in more detail in Section 4. 3.2. Activity of various catalysts The activities of NiS/SiO2-USY catalysts with different USY composition at 673 K are shown in Fig. 2.

Since all the hybrid catalysts composed of physically mixed metal/oxide and USY showed higher activities than did the SiO2-USY catalyst, it is most probable that metal sulfides on SiO2 play an important role in activation of the active sites on USY. It is generally recognized that toluene disproportionation is catalyzed by BrCnsted acid sites on zeolites [ 3,4,16,18,19 ]. Hence, the activity of the hybrid catalyst should increase in proportion to the content of USY zeolite in the catalyst, as the straight dashed line shown in Fig. 2. However, the experimental results showed that the activity of the hybrid catalysts was higher than expected. Especially, the activity of the hybrid catalyst containing 20 wt.-% of USY was almost twice as high as expected. It is also of interest (see Fig. 3) that the activity of NiS/SiOz-USY for toluene hydrogenation is much higher than that of either NiS/SiO2 or USY alone. Since NiS/SiO2 has no hydrogenation activity for the toluene molecule, the marked increase in the hydrogenation activity as a result of hybridization should be attrib- uted to the activation of hydrogenation active sites on USY zeolite surface by spiltover hydrogen. 2.5 42 g 1.5 ~ 0.5 0 I I I i 20 40 60 80 100 USY content in catalyst/% Fig. 3.

Coke deposited on catalysts As shown in Fig. 4a, the coke content on catalysts at the same time on stream in hydrogen atmosphere was proportional to the USY zeolite content in the hybrid catalysts and independent of the presence of NiS/SiO2, which means that the coke deposited only on USY zeolite. It is also clear that the coke deposition on USY was scarcely affected by the presence of NiS/SiO2 or hydrogen gas, whereas the cata- lytic activity was greatly affected by these catalytic factors. As exhibited in Fig. 4b, the activity per unit weight of zeolite of NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalysts with different USY content is greatly different, although the coke content per unit weight of zeolite is nearly the same. The higher the NiS content (that is the less the USY content) in the hybrid catalysts is, the higher is the activity per unit weight of USY zeolite. 3.4. Influence of temperature on yield The yields of toluene disproportionation over SiO2-USY and NiS/SiO2-USY (USY content 50%) catalysts were plotted against reaction temperature in Fig. 5. Over the SiO2-USY catalyst, the yields increased with increasing reaction temper- ature, and the variation of the yields over the temperature range 623-723 K were independent of the kind of atmosphere. On the NiS/SiOz-USY catalyst, however, hydrogen promoted the catalytic activity markedly, while nitrogen suppressed the reaction. Since NiS/SiO2 exhibited no catalytic activity for toluene disproportion- ation as shown in Fig. 2, the promoting effect of NiS over SiO2 should be attributed to its activity for hydrogen activation.

Discussion In terms of hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, NiS/SiO2 shows no activity and USY itself shows activity only at the initial period of time on stream. The stable hydrogenation activity of the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst should not be attrib- uted to the suppression of coke formation because the amount of deposited coke on the USY zeolite surface is not reduced by the presence of NiS/SiO2 (Fig. 4). The hydrogenation, in the absence of NiS/SiO2, should be the 'Transfer hydrogen- ation', that is hydrogen species generated during coke formation on the acidic zeolite hydrogenate the aromatic ring by acid catalysis [ 20,21 ]. If the rate of coke formation decreases, the rate of hydrogen supply to the acid sites decreases and thus the yield of hydrogenated product will decrease as in the case of the SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst in Fig. lb, in which the acid sites on USY zeolite should be covered by carbenium ions as coke precursors or disproportion- ation intermediates. In the case of the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid system, hydrogen in the gas phase should spill over to the SiO2 surface through NiS and then migrate to the surface of the USY zeolite in the form H+, H- or H [22]. These hydrogen species may react with the carbenium ion and recover the acid sites as shown in Fig. 6. This scheme can explain the stable hydrogenation activity most reasonably.

Yang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 115 124 This kind of hydrogen spillover phenomenon is similar to the observation in experiments of migration of hydrogen from Pt/T-A1203 to T-A1203 in the hydro- genation of benzene [23], deuterium from Pt/NaY to HNaY surface in OH-OD exchange observed by diffuse reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy [24], and hydrogen from FeS2 or FeS to the single crystal graphite [25]. In nitrogen, the result of nearly zero hydrogenation activity over NiS/SiO2-USY shown in Fig. lb may be due to a process of reverse spillover [26] in which hydrogen species produced on USY during coke formation migrate to the NiS/SiO2 surface and combine to hydrogen on NiS, and then desorb into the gas phase, which results in a lack of surface hydrogen on USY and higher coke deposition on it. In the presence of hydrogen, when the active metals-loaded zeolites are used as catalyst, hydrogen activated by metal may be promoting the hydrogenation of coke precursors and suppressing the formation of coke, thus prolonging the activity of the acidic component in zeolites [ 16,17]. It means that the hydrogenation functions of metals may reduce coke formation on the surface of zeolites [ 11 ]. On the other hand, it was reported that spillover species could remove coke from the catalyst surface and clean up the surface [ 27 ], for instance, spillover hydrogen in catalytic reforming and hydrocracking [28]. Under the present conditions, however, as shown in Fig. 4, the suppression of coke formation is not clear. The term coke may refer to any high-molecular-weight, highly carbonaceous species that is deposited on the zeolite surface. While the chemical nature of these deposits is not completely understood, their effect on catalyst activity is well known. Coking causes catalyst deactivation either by blockage or poisoning of the catalyst's active sites. In the present work, since an equal amount of USY was mixed physi- cally with SiO2-USY and NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalysts, respectively, and NiS has shown no effect on the suppression of coke formation on the USY zeolite surface, it could be deduced that the coke formation is proceeding by the same mechanism. Therefore, the differences caused by coking between the two types of catalysts in molecular diffusion coefficient and the number of active sites is negli- gible. Moreover, because the active sites for toluene disproportionation are on the USY zeolite surface and NiS/SiO2 has no activity for the reaction, as shown in Fig. 2, the presence of NiS/SiOR in the hybrid catalysts cannot result in an increase in the number of active sites. Hence, it could be assumed that at the same time on stream the number of residual active sites on the USY surface between SiO2-USY and NiS/SiOz-USY hybrid catalysts is nearly the same. As shown in Fig. la, however, the activity of NiS/SiO2-USY in the presence of hydrogen is about two times higher than that of SiO2-USY. This activity increase may result from the increase of the turnover frequency of the toluene disproportionation on the residual active sites by spiltover hydrogen. It is of interest to note why the promoting effect of the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst in hydrogen on toluene disproportionation was not observed during the initial period of time on stream. One reason is that at the initial stage, the amount of spiltover hydrogen (produced on NiS) is not enough to show a promoting effect, while the number of active sites on fresh USY zeolite M.-G. Yang et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 127 (1995) 115-124 123 is high. Another reason is that at the beginning of the reaction, toluene dispropor- tionation occurs on some strong acidic sites present on the fresh USY surface. As these acidic sites are deactivated by coking with time on stream, the promoting effect of spiltover hydrogen becomes stronger. Three different mechanisms of toluene disproportionation over zeolite have been postulated in the literature [9,29,30], including alkyl-transfer of a methyl group in a benzenium ion to another molecule, CHf formation by dissociation of a benzene ring and a methyl group in benzenium ion over zeolite, and the formation of diphenylalkane intermediate. The first step of the two former mechanisms is the addition of a proton at a BrCnsted acid site to the aromatic ring to form a benzenium ion intermediate, while in the third one, the first step involves a benzylic carbonium intermediate by taking a hydride from the methyl group of the toluene molecule on BrCnsted acid sites through protonation and formation of hydrogen. All the first steps, regardless of the mechanisms, involve the interaction of the proton at the BrCnsted acid site and the toluene molecule. In the case of USY zeolite catalyst, after the combination of the proton and the toluene molecule, the proton at the Br~nsted acid sites is consumed, and it can be compensated only after a catalytic cycle. However, in the case of the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst, in the presence of hydrogen the proton consumed in the first step in toluene disproportionation can be compensated through spilt-over hydrogen supplied from NiS/SiO2. Hence, the turnover frequency of toluene disproportionation may be increased, and the activity could be higher than over USY zeolite alone. In nitrogen atmosphere, the much lower conversion in toluene disproportionation over NiS/SiO2-USY catalysts as shown in Fig. 5, is due to the reverse spillover of surface hydrogen species in the form H+ or H- through NiS/SiO2, which creates a stable carbenium ion on USY zeolites and suppresses the catalytic activity. 5. Conclusion In the presence of hydrogen, hybrid catalysts composed of USY zeolite and a hydrogen-activated component exhibit higher activity for toluene disproportiona- tion than USY alone. For instance, the activity of NiS/SiOz-USY (USY 80%) is about 1.6 times higher than that of SiO2-USY at 673 K. According to the amount of deposited coke on various hybrid catalysts and on USY zeolite, respectively, the hydrogen-activated component has no effect on the suppression of coke formation on USY zeolite. In addition, according to the difference in yields of hydrogenation products produced in toluene disproportionation over NiS/SiO2-USY or SiO2- USY in hydrogen or nitrogen atmosphere, the increase of the activity over NiS/ SiO2-USY should be attributed to the effect of active hydrogen species which are generated by dissociation of hydrogen on NiS and which migrate onto the surface of USY zeolite on the promotion of desorption of carbenium ion as intermediates 124 M.-G.

All rights reserved Toluene disproportionation over NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalysts Effects of spilt-over hydrogen Ming-Gang Yang Ikusei Nakamura Kaoru Fujimoto * Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113, Japan * Corresponding author. Toluene disproportionation was studied on hybrid catalysts composed of physically mixed NiS/SiO2 and USY zeolite at 623 K-723 K, 1.0 MPa and W/F = 4.6g h/mol. The activity of the NiS/SiO2-USY hybrid catalyst was two times higher than that of USY in hydrogen atmosphere. Also USY hybrid catalysts containing NiS/Al2O3, NiS/TiO2 and Mo/S2Al2O3 showed high activity for toluene disproportionation. The amount of deposited coke on NiS/SiO2 , USY zeolite and NiS/SiO2-USY (USY content 50%) catalysts was 0.45, 16.1 and 7.6%, respectively, which suggests that coke deposited only on the zeolite. Although the rate of coke deposition was scarcely affected by the presence of NiS/SiO2 , the deactivation rate was effectively suppressed by the presence of NiS/SiO2 and gaseous hydrogen. It was suggested that hydrogen species supplied by hydrogen spillover at NiS sites and inter-particle migration promote the turnover frequency of toluene disproportionation at Brønsted acid sites on USY zeolite surface.
