The structure of 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction. In the presence of Cu(OAc)2, 1a and (η-C4H4BPh)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(η-C4H4BPh) (1b) catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with diphenylacetylene selectively giving 1,2,3,4-tetraphenylnaphtalene in 50–90% yields. Analogous reactions of benzoic acid with 1-phenyl-1-butyne catalyzed by 1a and [CpRhI2]2 regioselectively give 1,4-diethyl-2,3-diphenylnaphthalene. The related dicationic triple-decker complexes [(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)]2+ (3) and [Cp*Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)IrCp*]2+ (4) were also tested as catalysts. Keywords C−H activation Rhodium Metal complex catalysis Triple-decker complexes 1 Introduction The metal-catalyzed CH functionalization of organic compounds is of great significance in synthetic chemistry [1]. In particular, the catalytic coupling reactions of aromatic compounds with alkynes give a number of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Extensive investigations in this area have revealed that the cyclopentadienyl complexes [Cp*MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) can effect regioselective arene CH bond activation under chelation-assistance of an appropriate directing group (e.g., COOR, OH, C(O)NR2 substituents) [2]. Satoh and Miura have shown that these complexes catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes giving isocoumarins (M=Rh) and naphthalenes (M=Ir; Scheme 1 ) [3]. Recently, we have demonstrated that the selectivity depends not only on the nature of the metal, but also on the ligand. Thus, use of carborane-containing complexes [(C2B9H11)M(C6H6)]+ instead of cyclopentadienyl derivatives dramatically changes the selectivity of oxidative coupling giving naphthalenes for Rh and isocoumarins for Ir [4]. Triple-decker complexes of transition metals are well known [5]. They have unique structure in which two metal atoms are located between three cyclic frames. In 1972, Werner and Salzer have synthesized the first representative of such complexes, viz., the nickel derivative [CpNi(μ-η:η-Cp)NiCp]+ containing cyclopentadienyl ligand in a bridging position [6]. Boron-containing heterocycles possess the highest ability for the bifacial bonding with two metal atoms [7]. In particular, borole ligand C4H4BR was used for the synthesis of numerous triple-decker complexes [8]. However, the complexes of this class have not yet been applied in catalysis. Herein we report unexpected formation of the hybrid rhodacyclopentadienyl/borole triple-decker complex (η-C4H4BMe)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4Rh{(μ-η:η-C4H4BMe)Rh(η-C4H4BMe)})Rh(η-C4H4BMe) (2) as byproduct in reaction of dimethylamine adduct of 1-methyl-3-borolene C4H6BMe·NMe2H with bis(ethylene)rhodium complex [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 as well as study of the catalytic activity of μ-borole triple-decker complexes (η-C4H4BR)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BR)Rh(η-C4H4BR) (1a: R=Me, 1b: R=Ph), [9] [(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)]2+ (3) [10] and [Cp*Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)IrCp*]2+ (4) [11] in oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with internal alkynes. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Reaction of dimethylamine adduct of 1-methyl-3-borolene with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 Herberich et al. have previously shown that reaction of borolenes C4H6BR with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 is an effective method for the synthesis of triple-decker complexes with a bridging borole ligand (η-C4H4BR)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BR)Rh(η-C4H4BR) (1a: R=Me, 1b: R=Ph) [9]. In present work we found that the analogous reaction of complex C4H6BMe·NMe2H with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 results in the formation of the hybrid rhodacyclopentadienyl/borole triple-decker complex (η-C4H4BMe)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4Rh{(μ-η:η-C4H4BMe)Rh(η-C4H4BMe)})Rh(η-C4H4BMe) (2) as a minor product (<1%) along with the main product 1a (Scheme 2 ). The 1H spectral data for 2 are consistent with the expected structure. The proton signals related to the Rh-cycle are observed at δ =5.19 (α-Н) and 6.84 (β-Н) ppm; they are very close to the signals previously reported for rhodium complexes with the C4H4Rh ring (5.58–6.86ppm) [12,13]. The signals of the bridging borole ring protons are upfield-shifted (Δδ=0.15–0.31ppm) as compared to the corresponding signals for the terminal borole ring. The structure of 2 was investigated by X-ray diffraction study (Fig. 1 ). It is the first crystallographically characterized triple-decker complex with bridging rhodacyclopentadienyl ligand. Earlier, Müller and co-workers [12] have described complexes (η4-diene)(μ-H)Rh(μ-η:η-C4R4Rh{η4-diene})Rh(η4-diene) containing diene ligands in terminal positions, however, their structure was not confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Complex 2 consists of two triple-decker fragments: (η-C4H4B)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4Rh)Rh(η-C4H4B) and (η-C4H4B)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4B)Rh. In both cases the planes of the cyclic ligands are almost parallel (dihedral angles C4H4Rh/C4H4B=3.9 and 5.1°; C4H4B/C4H4B=3.8°). Commonly, the heterocyclic ligands in sandwich compounds are folded along the axis Cα⋯Cα', with the heteroatom being deviated from the C4 plane away from the metal atom. For example, the folding angle 1 1 Folding angle is dihedral angle between C–X–C and C4 planes, where X is heteroatom. and the deviation of the Rh atom from the C4 plane for (η4-nbd)Rh(η-C4Me2H2Rh{η4-nbd}PMe3) (nbd − norbornadiene) are 17.1° and 0.47Å, respectively [12]. In contrast, the bridging rings C4H4Rh and C4H4B in 2 are almost planar (folding angles are 0.7 and 1.2°). The C4H4Rh ring is strongly distorted pentagon owing to great difference of the CC and Rh–C bond lengths (av. 1.450 and 2.022Å, respectively); the angle C21−Rh2−C24 (78.39(18)°) is considerably smaller than 108° (typical of a regular pentagon). The distance Rh3⋯Rh4 (3.654Å) in 2 exceeds the sum of the covalent radii RhRh (av. 2.92Å) [14] suggesting the absence of the direct RhRh bond in this case. At the same time the Rh2Rh3 and Rh2Rh4 bonds (2.6500(5) and 2.6299(5) Å) are shorter than the corresponding bond in sandwich complex (η4-nbd)Rh(η-C4Me2H2Rh{η4-nbd}PMe3) (2.704Å) [12]. Although these bonds are considerably longer than the Rh1–B2 bond (2.267(5) Å), the metal-to-ring distances for bridging rings Rh3⋯C4H4Rh2, Rh4⋯C4H4Rh2 and Rh1⋯C4H4B2 are practically the same (1.825, 1.828 and 1.830Å, respectively). It is noteworthy that these values are very close to the corresponding distances in the related μ-borole triple-decker complexes (η-C4H4BPh)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(η-C4H4BPh) and (η-C4H4BPh)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Ru(η-C5R5) (1.826−1.845Å, av. 1.835Å) [15]. The Rh⋯C4H4B distances in 2 for the terminal borole ligands (1.780−1.788Å, av. 1.784Å) are shorter than for the bridging one (1.830Å) that is in accordance with general tendency for triple-decker complexes [16]. A supposed pathway of the reaction of dimethylamine adduct of 1-methyl-3-borolene with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 is illustrated in Scheme 3 . Probably, dehydrogenation of the borolene and its subsequent coordination mainly produce the chloride complex [(η-C4H4BMe)RhCl]4 (A). Similar iodides [(η-C4H4BR)RhI]4 (R=Me, Ph) have been described and structurally characterized earlier [17]. Further transformation of A leads to the formation of the triple-decker complex 1a (the main product of the reaction). Side reaction takes place in such a way that at the first stage, the removal of boron atom from the starting borolene occurs. The subsequent reaction with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2 affords the rhodacyclopentadienyl derivative (C2H4)2Rh(η-C4H4Rh(H)2(C2H4)2) (B). Related intermediates have been suggested earlier by Müller and co-workers [12] in reactions of [(η4-nbd)MCl]2 with magnesium butadiene (C4H6Mg). Possibly the coordinated amine, NMe2H, acts as the basic agent to facilitate removal of the boron atom. Subsequent reaction of B with A and C4H6BMe·NMe2H finally gives the minor product 2. 2.2 Oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with alkynes It is known that the triple-decker complexes easily undergo nucleophilic degradation [18]. For example, Herberich has shown that complexes 1a,b react with CpNa giving two sandwich compounds CpRh(η-C4H4BR) and [Rh(η-C4H4BR)2]− [9b] Similar reaction of 1a,b with I2 affords iodine derivatives [(η-C4H4BR)RhI]4 and Rh(η-C4H4BR)2I. [17]. Taking into account this reactivity, we examined 1a,b as well as the related μ-borole triple-decker complexes [(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)]2+ (3) [10] and [Cp*Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)IrCp*]2+ (4) [11] as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with diphenylacetylene in refluxing o-xylene (Scheme 4 ). This reaction has two possible pathways giving either isocumarin 5a or naphthalene 5b. Copper acetate and silver carbonate were used as co-catalysts (necessary for oxidation of MI to MIII). We hypothesized that the triple-decker complexes would be cleaved by benzoic acid, giving the catalytically active species (η-C4H4BR)Rh, (9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)Rh or Cp*M (M=Rh, Ir), which may act as catalysts of CH activation in aromatic compounds. As can be seen from Table 1 , complexes 1a,b selectively catalyze the oxidative coupling to give naphthalene 5b as a sole product in 50–90% yields. The turnover number (TON) is ca. 20–45. The phenyl-substituted complex 1b reveals higher catalytic activity than the methyl derivative 1a, which may be explained by better stabilization of catalytic intermediates by phenyl substituent. It is interesting to note that the rhodium complex [Cp*RhCl2]2 predominantly gives isocumarin 5a instead of 5b [3]. The triple-decker complex 3 having two carborane ligands in terminal positions catalyzes the oxidative coupling reaction giving the naphthalene 5b as the major product in moderate yield (40%). Earlier we have shown that chloride (η-9-SMe2-7,8-Me2-C2B9H8)RhCl2 reacts in the same manner [4a] and suggested that the key catalytic species is (η-9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H8R2)Rh (R=H, Me). This leads to the conclusion that the selectivity of the oxidative coupling is mainly determined by the nature of the terminal ligands in the triple-decker structure. Taking into account the different selectivity of rhodium and iridium cyclopentadienyl complexes [3], we have assumed that the use of the heterometallic RhIr triple-decker complex 4 with different co-catalysts (Cu(OAc)2 or Ag2CO3) may lead to different products. However, in both cases the reaction predominantly gives isocoumarin 5a, suggesting that the selectivity is determined by direction of nucleophilic degradation of 4. Usually, the bonding in triple-decker complexes between bridging ligand and rhodium atom is weaker compared to iridium. Therefore the most probable catalytic particle in these reactions is Cp*Rh. The reaction of benzoic acid with 1-phenyl-1-butyne catalyzed by 1a regioselectively gives 1,4-diethyl-2,3-diphenylnaphthalene (6) in 54% yield (Scheme 5 ). The (cyclopentadienyl)rhodium complex [CpRhI2]2 catalyzes this reaction in a similar way to give 6 in 81% yield. In accordance with the mechanism proposed by Satoh and Miura [3], the formation of naphthalenes in oxidative coupling reactions proceeds via rhodacycle intermediate C. The observed regioselectivity is explained by better stabilization of α-carbon atoms in C by phenyl substituent [19]. 3 Conclusion The formation of a minor product, the hybrid rhodacyclopentadienyl/borole triple-decker complex 2, caused by the coordinated amine, was observed in the reaction of C4H6BMe·NMe2H with [(C2H4)2RhCl]2. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a crystallographically characterized triple-decker complex with a bridging rhodacyclopentadienyl ligand. The main product of this reaction is the triple-decker complex 1a. X-ray data for 2 suggest that the bonding of rhodium with the rhodacyclopentadienyl ligand C4H4Rh is very close to that with borole C4H4B. The triple-decker complexes with a bridging borole ligand were shown to be effective catalysts for the oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with alkynes. For instance, complexes 1a,b exhibit notable catalytic activity in reactions of benzoic acid with alkynes in the presence of Cu(OAc)2, giving exclusively naphthalenes. The observed catalytic selectivity is determined by the direction of the nucleophilic degradation of triple-decker structure and the nature of terminal ligands. 4 Experimental 4.1 General The reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere in dry degassed solvents. The isolation of products was conducted in air. Starting complex [Rh(C2H4)2Cl]2 was prepared as described [20]. Complex C4H6BMe·NMe2H was synthesized from C4H6BNMe2 and LiMe in a similar manner as C4H6BPh·NMe2H [21]. The 1H, 11B and 13C NMR spectra (δ in ppm) were recorded with a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer operating at 400.13, 128.38 and 100.61MHz, respectively. 4.2 (η-C4H4BMe)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BMe)Rh(η-C4H4BMe) (1a) The 50ml of THF was added to the mixture of [Rh(C2H4)2Cl]2 (1.94g, 5mmol) and C4H6BMe·NMe2H (3.13g, 25mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 48h at ambient temperature. The solvent was removed in a high vacuo and the residue was subjected to column chromatography (aluminium oxide activity grade II; 3×10cm). Elution first with hexane led to a brown band, which was discarded. The further elution with hexane/CH2Cl2 mixture (1/1) gave the second dark-orange band, which was evaporated till 20ml, crystallized at −78°C and held for 4h in a high vacuo. Yield of 1a is 1.05g (3.12mmol; 62%). Orange solid, which has 99% purity according to NMR. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 5.21 (m, 4Н, β-Н, η-С4Н4В); 4.77 (m, 2Н, β-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4В); 4.05 (m, 4Н, α-Н, η-С4Н4В); 3.86 (m, 2Н, α-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4В); 0.63 (s, 3Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4ВMe); 0.39 (s, 6Н, η-С4Н4ВMe). 11В {1Н} NMR (CDCl3) δ: 21.4 (broad, 2B, η-С4Н4В), 10.1 (broad, 1B, μ-η:η-С4Н4В). 13C {1Н} NMR (CDCl3) δ: 88.55 (d, J(C-Rh)=9Hz, β-C, η-С4Н4В); 80.20 (broad, α-C, η-С4Н4В); 69.60 (broad, α-C, μ-η:η-С4Н4В), 62.98 (t, J(C-Rh)=8Hz, β-C, μ-η:η-С4Н4В), −3.71 (broad, Me) (cf [9b]).

After recrystallization of 1a by slow evaporation of its hexane solution, orange admixture crystals (<1%) of (η-C4H4BMe)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4Rh{(μ-η:η-C4H4BMe)Rh(η-C4H4BMe)})Rh(η-C4H4BMe) (2) were selected. 1H NMR (CDCl3) for 2, δ: 6.84 (m, 2Н, β-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4Rh), 5.26 (m, 2Н, β-Н, η-С4Н4В), 5.19 (m, 2Н, α-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4Rh), 5.18 (m, 4Н, β-Н, η-С4Н4В), 4.95 (m, 2Н, β-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4В), 4.21 (m, 4Н, α-Н, η-С4Н4В), 4.10 (m, 2Н, α-Н, η-С4Н4В), 3.95 (m, 2Н, α-Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4В), 0.67 (s, 3Н, μ-η:η-С4Н4ВMe), 0.44 (s, 3Н, η-С4Н4ВMe), 0.27 (s, 6Н, η-С4Н4ВMe). 4.3 Oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with alkynes (general procedure) A mixture of benzoic acid (31mg, 0.25mmol), alkyne (0.5mmol), catalyst (0.005mmol), o-xylene (2ml), and Cu(OAc)2 (182mg, 1.00mmol) or Ag2CO3 (138mg, 0.5mmol) was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 6h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was extracted with diethyl ether. The extract was chromatographed on a silica column (1×15cm). Unreacted alkyne was washed off with petroleum ether. Then the yellow band was collected using diethyl ether as the eluent. After the removal of the solvent in vacuo, isocumarin 5a or naphthalenes 5b and 6 were obtained as yellow oils. 5a, 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 8.44 (d, 1H, J =8.0Hz); 7.67 (m, 1H); 7.55 (m, 1H); 7.44 (m, 3H), 7.35 (m, 2H), 7.20–7.30 (m, 6H) (cf.

[22]). 6, 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 8.30 (m, 2H); 7.68 (m, 2H); 7.11–7.24 (m, 10H); 2.98 (q, 4H, J =10.0Hz), 1.30 (t, 6H, J =10.0Hz) (cf. [23]). 4.4 X-ray crystallography Crystals of 2 were grown by slow evaporation of hexane solution of crude 1a. Crystals of 2 (C24H32B4Rh4, M=775.37) are triclinic, space group P-1, at 120K: a=10.6545(9), b=10.9399(9), c=11.9022(10)Å, α=89.571(2), β=85.811(2), γ=61.680(2)°, V=1217.42(18) Å3, Z=2, dcalc =2.115gcm−3, μ(MoKα)=26.75сm−1, F(000)=752. Intensities of 15185 reflections were measured with a Bruker APEX2 DUO diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ=0.71073Å, ω-scans, 2θ<58°), and 6460 independent reflections [Rint 0.0536] were used in further refinement. The structure was solved by direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares against F2 in anisotropic approximation for non-hydrogen atoms. The positions of hydrogen atoms were calculated, and they were refined in isotropic approximation in riding model. The refinement converged to wR2 =0.0855 and GOF=1.006 for all the independent reflections (R1 =0.0359 was calculated against F for 5224 observed reflections with I>2σ(I)). All calculations were performed using the SHELXTL PLUS 5.0 software [24]. Acknowledgement This work was supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant # 15-03-04057).

The structure of 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction. In the presence of Cu(OAc)2, 1a and (η-C4H4BPh)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(η-C4H4BPh) (1b) catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acid with diphenylacetylene selectively giving 1,2,3,4-tetraphenylnaphtalene in 50–90% yields. Analogous reactions of benzoic acid with 1-phenyl-1-butyne catalyzed by 1a and [CpRhI2]2 regioselectively give 1,4-diethyl-2,3-diphenylnaphthalene. The related dicationic triple-decker complexes [(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)Rh(9-SMe2-7,8-C2B9H10)]2+ (3) and [Cp*Rh(μ-η:η-C4H4BPh)IrCp*]2+ (4) were also tested as catalysts.",
