First the possibility of this method was studied by simulation. On the basis of this simulation it was experimentally realised, thanks to the slow deactivation of the catalyst under supercritical conditions and high feed mole fraction, to determine directly the catalyst activity vs. time on stream. The method seems to be superior to classical methods based on the stationary kinetics of the reaction system. A model for the deactivation kinetic is presented. Keywords: Kinetics; Deactivation; Ethylbenzene disproportionation; Supercritical conditions 1. Introduction The deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts, particularly zeolites, is an impor- tant problem in chemical and petro-chemical industry, e.g. cracking, hydrocrack- ing, isomerisation, etc. Catalyst deactivation by coking can be prevented or retarded by in situ dissolution of coke precursor under supercritical reaction conditions [1-3]. The activity or the deactivation kinetics of catalysts is traditionally determined on the basis of stationary kinetics. According to the suggestion of Levenspiel [4] * Corresponding author.

Hofrnann/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 273-285 the method of concentration control in recycle reactors was proposed by L6we and others (see [5-7]). By means of this control the reactant concentrations in the reactor can be kept on a predefined level. Therefore, the concentration-controlled recycle reactor was evinced as a valuable instrument for investigations of reaction kinetics [8-10] as well as for the determination of catalyst activity at ambient pressure [11]. In this study, the activity and deactivation kinetics of a HY-zeolite (HYZ) under supercritical conditions (P>45 bar, T>550) were determined in a continuously operated recycle reactor with concentration control, where ethyl- benzene disproportionation (EBD) into benzene (B) and diethylbenzene (DEB) served as test reaction with pentane as inert. For similar studies with other inerts see [ 12]. The method of concentration control allows elegantly to determine immediately the catalytic activity without extra data for the stationary kinetics. Up to now experiments using concentration control have been reported only for ambient pressure. Owing to the slow deactivation of catalyst under supercritical conditions and high ethylbenzene (EB) concentration, it is possible to realise the concentra- tion control also at high pressure. 2. Experimental equipment The computer-controlled experimental equipment consists of a feeding system, a gradientless recycle reactor, a gas chromatograph (GC) for the analysis of the reaction mixture, and a data processing and control unit consisting of two PCs. One was used for the input of operating conditions and initial concentrations as well as simulation of an ideal continuously operated recycle reactor, the other for storing the analysis results, estimation of kinetic parameters and the catalyst activity and saving the simulation results on hard disk. A detailed description of the experi- mental set-up can be found in [13]. 3. Simulation of the activity determination 3. l. Method and principle of concentration control The conception of the concentration control is based on the following assump- tions [5]\" the reaction scheme and the reaction stoichiometry is known, the system is in quasi-stationary state, i.e. the stationary mass balance for a CSTR can be used and each stationary state can be characterised by the mole fraction of reactants and the flow of inert. Additionally for heterogeneous catalytic reactions it must be proved that the intrinsic reaction rate is measured, i.e. neither film nor pore diffusion limitations exist at experimental conditions (see [12]). E Niu, H. Hofmann/Applied Catalysis A: General 158 (1997) 273-285 275 To describe quantitatively the process of catalyst deactivation, the activity of catalyst aj can be defined as rj(fref, Zref~ t) (1) aj = rO(Cref, Tref, t = 0)' i.e. the ratio of the reaction rate at time t to that at time t=O (i.e. with fresh catalyst), both at the same temperature Tref and concentrations Cref- Due to the deactivation of the catalyst, the reactant concentration increases with increasing experimental time and the product concentration decreases. In order to compensate this tendency, the reactant concentration in the feed will be lowered and at the same time the product concentration in the feed increased by the concentration control. Thus the composition of product mixture in the reactor is independent of the reaction time. Under this prerequisite, the reference reaction rate rfref, Tref, t ~- 0) can be determined directly from the rate of consumption of reactant at the start of the reaction. During the experiment the reaction rate rj(fref~ Zref, t) can be obtained from the rate of reactant consumption. With those data, it is possible to calculate immediately the catalyst activity without previous knowledge of the stationary kinetics of the reaction system. According to the mass balance of an ideal continuously operated stationary recycle reactor, the rate of consumption of reactant Ri can be expressed in terms of the following model: Cio -- C i (-Ri) = - ~ijrj -- ~- , (2) j=l where rj is the rate of thejth reaction in a complex reaction system. For the reactant EB one has (--REB) -- CEB,0 -- CEB (3) \"7- and = - ' - (4) t=O so that a(t) = fEB,0 -- fEB (fEB,0 -- fEB)t:0' (5) where CEB,0--CEB is the difference between EB concentration in the reactor (stationary) and its feed concentration, which will be changed with time on stream. The needed feed concentrations of components can be calculated with an auxiliary model of the reaction rate (the so-called Kalman-Filter [14]) and the 276 E Niu, H. Hofmann/Applied Catalysis A.\" General 158 (1997) 273-285 material balance of the ideal recycle reactor. As auxiliary model a simple linear equation (even a constant, i.e., zero-order) can express the reaction rate of EBD r = kCEB (6) so that the rate of consumption of the component i becomes (-Ri) = kest,ifEB. (7) From Eqs. (7) and (2) it follows that kest,i(t) Ci,o(t) - Ci(t) _ Yi,o(t) - yi(t) = CEB (t)~- YEB (t)'r (8) According to the stoichiometry there is kest,EB (t) = -2kest,B (t) = --2kest,DEB (t), (9) then kest(t) -- 1 k 3( est,EB (t) -- 2kest,B (t) - 2kest,OEB (t)). (10) Using the estimated parameter kest,EB(t), the control parameter Co,i(t) can be determined. From the mass balance it follows as well: Co,i (t) = Csoll,ill/ikest (t) fEB (t) % (11) where the set value Csoll is the target concentration vector, determined by a pre- experiment. Fig. 1 shows the principle of the adaptive control system. The control variable is the concentration Co,i at reactor inlet. C~0,i is the initial feed concentra- tion. The outlet signal of the reactor is changed by chemical reaction and deactivation.

The effluent concentration will be many times caught by means of a subprogram, before an estimated value is accepted by the control strategy, so that the measuring error can be eliminated. The mean value of the concentration Car indicates the actual state in the reactor. The kinetic parameter kest as well as the catalyst activity can be obtained by a simple auxiliary model. 3.2. Simulation for the determination of catalyst activi~ In order to test the capability of the control principle introduced above, simulation programs were developed, which run on the two PCs [12]. In these programs a parameter (called ananum) indicates the number of analysis used for the estimation of the system state Cav. It has a strong influence on the quality of the control because the estimated reactant concentration in the reactor should be located in the stationary range. Hofmann and Kolb [ 11] selected in their study a value of 8 for ananum. As a too small number probably does not give the real stationary value and a too large number slows down the control algorithm, here on a trial basis a value of 2, 4 and 6 were applied for the same simulation conditions. As shown by Fig. 2, ananum=4 is an optimal value to catch the set value of control. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the simulated catalyst activity and the activities determined by concentration control with different values of ananum. Further, the influence of auxiliary models on the concentration control were checked by the simulation. As Fig. 4 shows, there is no obvious difference between yeb [-] 0,7 , - ..........

Activity determination by concentration control In order to realise the concentration control, the experimental set-up must provide an automatic analysis and data processing, the storage of analytical results on the computer, the estimation of kinetic parameters with an auxiliary model and adjusting the control variable (feed concentration). The experimental set-up described circumstantially in [13] fully satisfied those prerequisites. 4.1. Experimental design While on the basis of a stationary kinetics, a deactivation model was established for supercritical conditions and small feed mole fraction of EB in the temperature range of 573-673 K [15], a suitable model for large feed mole fractions of EB (YEB,0=0.8) is not available due to the existence of an optimum temperature for the rate of reaction [15]. The selected temperatures ought to be above the optimum temperature and at the same time should not be too high due to strong coking. Therefore, three temperatures (613, 633 and 653 K) were selected. The other experimental conditions were 450Nml/min (total flow rate), 50bar and YEB,0=0.8. 4.2. Experimental results The determination of the catalyst activity can only be reliable if the concentra- tion control functions so well that the set value is achieved quick enough and kept accurately during the experimental time. As an example the control quality for EB is described in Fig. 5. It is shown that the set value of the EB concentration was kept within an error of % during the whole experiment. Fig. 6 shows the activity curves of the catalyst measured at three different experimental temperatures. There is an obvious dependency of the effective activity on temperature. 5. Modelling the deactivation kinetics In general, the decrement of catalyst activity is a function of temperature, pressure, concentration of the species causing deactivation and the effective activity: da dt = f(T, P, Cdea~ a). (12) As all experiments were carried out only at one pressure, the influence of 280 E Niu, H.

Furthermore, in the concentration- controlled experiments the activity-time-function is independent of the reactant concentrations. Therefore, one can assume that the deactivation kinetics can be F.

(14) The parameters of deactivation kinetics can be determined by the integral method [16]. For n the integral equation is a(t)1-\" -a(0)1-\" = (n- 1)kdt. (15) By plotting the above equation in a linear form, the model parameters kd and n can be found. In all cases it was found by trial and error that an order of n= 1.02 (i.e. practically n=l) for the deactivation rate was most appropriate to describe the experimentally determined values.Fig. 7 shows the plot ofa(t)l-\"-a(0)1 n against (n-1)t at three different temperatures. From the slope of the regression lines, the rate constant kd has been estimated as 1.5540-3, 3.805x10-3 and 9.077x 10-3 min-1, respectively, at 613, 633 and 653 K. Plotting kd in an Arrhenius diagram, one can determine the deactivation energy Ed and the frequency factor kd,o (see Fig. 8).

At high temperature the error becomes greater due to the rapid deactivation of catalyst, causing a quick change of reactant concentrations; thus it is more difficult to keep them constant. The deactivation energy estimated here is much higher than that at normal pressureI [11] and under supercritical conditions for small feed mole fractions of 15 ~At normal pressure and a temperature range of 513-573 K, da/dt = 0.07exp(38 (kJ/mol)/RT)a .

This means that the catalyst deactivates much slower under supercritical conditions and at high feed mole fraction of EB, because coke precursor will be better extracted by concentrated supercritical reaction fluid. 6. Conclusion Deactivation kinetics of a heterogeneous catalyst under supercritical conditions was studied by use of a concentration-controlled recycle reactor. The simulation testified the possibility of this method. The number of analytical values used for the estimation of the system state has a strong influence on the control quality. The simulation showed also that the reaction order in the auxiliary kinetic model does not affect the concentration control. Using the optimal number of analytical values and a first reaction order approximate model, the catalyst activity vs. time on stream was experimentally determined in the suitable range of temperature. A simple kinetic model for the deactivation was proposed at supercritical conditions and high mole fraction of ethylbenzene. The high value of the estimated deactivation energy and small deactivation order deduce that the catalyst deac- tivates much slower under supercritical operating conditions than under atmo- spheric pressure. 284 F.

On the basis of this simulation it was experimentally realised, thanks to the slow deactivation of the catalyst under supercritical conditions and high feed mole fraction, to determine directly the catalyst activity vs. time on stream. The method seems to be superior to classical methods based on the stationary kinetics of the reaction system. A model for the deactivation kinetic is presented.
