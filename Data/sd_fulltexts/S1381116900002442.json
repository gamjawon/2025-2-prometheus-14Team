Tel.: +81-426-77-2837; fax: +81-426-77-2821 Tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes have been successfully metathesized over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4) under very mild reaction conditions. The addition of SnBu4 is essential to the acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET). A series of new oligo(silylenevinylene)s with σ-π conjugation has been produced. Grubbs, Schrock catalysts and WCl6–SnMe4 were, however, inactive for the ADMET. All of the products were acyclic oligomers and the cyclic products were not formed. The reactivity of divinylsilanes is attributed to the bulkiness of substituent at silicon atom and the existence of silicon atom instead of carbon atom decreases the reactivity greatly. Keywords Tetravinylsilane Vinylsilanes Metathesis Acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) Silylene-vinylene Rhenia–alumina catalyst (Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst) σ–π conjugated oligo(silylenevinylene)s 1 Introduction We have reported that Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst is one of the best metathesis catalysts due to its high activity and selectivity >94% for various kinds of simple alkenes at low temperatures [1–10]. The catalyst promoted with alkyltin as a cocatalyst also showed high activity and selectivity for the metathesis of halogen-containing olefin [11]. Various kinds of monoallylsilanes and diallylsilanes have been metathesized with good yields in the presence of Re2O7/Al2O3 [12,13] and Schrock catalysts [12,14–17]. However, it has been reported that dimethyldivinylsilane was practically inactive over both Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with tetra-n-butyltin (SnBu4) [13] and Schrock catalyst [12,15,18], although trimethylvinylsilane was metathesized with conversion of 3%–13% [12,13,16,17]. On the other hand, Marciniec et al. [12,19–29] have succeeded in getting silylene-vinylene oligomers via polycondensation of dimethyldivinylsilane and divinyltetramethyldisiloxane in the presence of a variety of ruthenium and rhodium catalysts. However, a fair amount of products, which essentially differs from the structures expected by metathesis reaction, was accompanied and thus the reaction has been understood as a non-metallacarbene mechanism. The poly(silylenevinylene) and spiro compounds with σ–π conjugation are of growing interest and importance as partly conjugated optical material with high transparency and relatively high second and third hyperpolarizability predicted by the ab initio molecular orbital calculation [30]. We have succeeded for the first time to synthesize oligo(silylenevinylene)s by the ADMET reaction of tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes over a Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst and a part of the results has been earlier reported [31]. Here, we report the additional results on the synthesis of oligo(silylenevinylene)s by ADMET of tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts promoted with SnBu4 and over homogeneous metathesis catalysts, WCl6–SnMe4, Grubbs, and Schrock catalysts. The reaction conditions, reactivities of divinylsilanes have been investigated in detail. The resulting oligomers were structurally characterized. 2 Experimental Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst (Re2O7 content: 18.1 wt.%) was prepared by using impregnation technique described in previous papers [1,3,30]. Bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidine ruthenium(IV) dichloride (Grubbs catalyst) generously provided by Prof. Grubbs and 2,6-diisopropylphenylimidoneophylidenemolybdenum(VI) bis(hexafluoro-t-butoxide) (Schrock catalyst) (Strem Chemicals) were used without further purification. WCl6 was purified by sublimation under vacuum at 110°C. SnBu4 was dried over molecular sieves 5 Å and used without further purification. Tetravinylsilane, dimethyldivinylsilane, diphenyldivinylsilane, diethoxydivinylsilane, trimethylvinylsilane and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene are commercially available from Shinetsu silicon company. The silanes and n-dodecane as an internal standard were dried over molecular sieves 5 Å. Benzene, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, n-decane and monochlorobenzene (PhCl) used as a solvent were dried over P2O5 and distilled. In a batch system, the reactions were carried out in nitrogen gas at atmospheric pressure in a Schlenk-type glass reactor with stirring. The activation conditions of the catalyst and the experimental procedures were essentially identical to those described in the previous paper [31]. In a flow system, the reactions were carried out at atmosphere pressure in a single path continuous-flow system with a fixed catalyst bed in a tubular Pyrex glass reactor. The activated catalyst was pretreated with SnBu4 before the reaction. Typical reaction conditions were as follows; catalyst: 1 g; reactant concentration: 0.06 M; flow rate: 2.5 ml/h. Homogeneous metathesis reactions were carried out using three kinds of catalysts under the following reaction conditions: reactant/catalyst molar ratio: 50–100; temperature: 20°C–60°C; reaction time: 18 h; and solvent: benzene or 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Metathesis products were analyzed by GC, GC-MS and 1H and 13C NMR [31]. Each oligomer separated by using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Shodex SD-4 was used for the identification and characterization of reaction products. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Screening of metathesis catalysts The activity of three kinds of homogeneous catalysts,WCl6–SnMe4, bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidine ruthenium(IV) dichloride and 2,6-diisopropylphenylimidoneophylidenemolybdenum(VI) bis(hexafluoro-t-butoxide) was investigated using tetravinylsilane, dimethyldivinylsilane and diethoxydivinylsilane as substrates. However, it was found that the three kinds of catalysts were all inactive for the metathesis. A small amount of by-product formed with reactant and catalyst was determined. Only the Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with SnBu4 appeared to be active for the ADMET reactions. 3.2 Reaction conditions It was found that dimethyldivinylsilane, diphenyldivinylsilane and diethoxydivinylsilane underwent the ADMET reactions selectively over the Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts in analogy with tetravinylsilane [30]. The ratio of higher oligomers increased with an increase in conversion, suggesting that the intermolecular metathesis proceeds with successive reaction. By-products were virtually not formed within the reaction temperatures (25°C–110°C) investigated. However, in the case of diphenyldivinylsilane a product with two constitutional repeating units was formed selectively and this might be attributed to the poor solubility of the product formed. The effects of the amount of SnBu4 were examined using a batch and flow system. The activity increased greatly by the addition of small amount of SnBu4 and became constant for the catalyst treated with more than 0.07 Sn/Re molar ratio as shown in Fig. 1 . No apparent differences were found in the product distributions by changing the ratio. As the catalytic activity in the absence of SnBu4 was nearly 0%, the use of alkyltin is essential. The effective amount of SnBu4 for the catalyst has been reported to be 0.09 [11], in fairly good agreement with 0.07 in this study. Two solvents, monochlorobenzene and n-decane, were used to see the solvent effects and to make sure there was no duplication of the solvents and reaction products in the analysis of GLC. The solvent effects were not found. 3.3 Identification of reaction products Oligomers of tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes, which are new compounds, were isolated by GPC and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data for a series of oligo(silylenevinylene)s with σ–π conjugation are summarized in Table 1 . Not only in Table 1, but also in this paper, e.g. dimer and hexamer mean that they have the constitutional repeating units 2 and 6, respectively. The isomer ratio of tetramer to hexamer produced in the metathesis of tetravinylsilane were determined from GC and NMR data. In the case of tetramer, for example, the δ and integrated values of outer –CH=CH2 and inner –CH=CH2 were 5.79 (dd, 9H) and 5.78 (dd, 5H), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 . The theoretical ratios of outer and inner –CH=CH2 is 6:4 for the straight chain compound and 9:1 for the branched compound. When we assume the ratio of the straight and the branched compound as x and y, respectively, the equation, (6x+9y)/(4x+1y)=9/5, can be obtained, resulting in x=85%, y=15%. The ratio agreed with the area ratio of GC. The other oligomer ratio determined in the same manner has already been reported [31]. In the case of the metathesis of tetravinylsilane, the formation of cyclic compounds and/or spiro compounds are expected, but they were not found in the reaction products of each divinylsilane. In the metathesis of 1,4-alkadiene over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst, 1,4-cyclohexadiene was formed by the intramolecular metathesis of trienes with fairly high selectivity and increased with increasing conversion, e.g. the selectivity was 42% at 40% conversion in the metathesis of 1,4-pentadiene, and 50% at 90% conversion from 1,4-hexadiene and 1,4-octadiene [5,6]. On the other hand, in the metathesis of 3-methyl-1,4-pentadiene over Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst, main reaction products were linear oligomer and the selectivity of cyclic compounds was only 3% at 60% conversion level [32]. The cis conformation of the inner olefin is essential to form cyclohexadiene via an intramolecular metathesis. The much lower formation of 3,6-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene from 3-methyl-1,4-pentadiene compared with cyclohexadiene from 1,4-alkadiene could be attributed to the steric hindrance between methyl substituents at cis conformation of the inner olefin. In the case of tetravinylsilane, there are much larger steric strains; bulkiness of the vinyl substituent is larger than that of methyl group and two vinyl groups at silicon atom makes cis conformation much difficult. These could be the reasons why spiro compounds from tetravinylsilane were not formed. In the same manner, cis conformation at the inner olefin is essential to form the cyclic compounds from oligomers of tetravinysilane and disubstituted divinylsilane. This makes ring-closing metathesis reaction more difficult, leading to no cyclic compound formation. 3.4 Reactivity of divinylsilanes The relative reactivity of a series of methyl-1-hexene (Me-1-C6 ′) is as follows: 3-Me-1-C6 ′ (0.08)<4-Me-1-C6 ′ (0.72)<5-Me-1-C6 ′ (1.00) [7]. The data show that the nearer the methyl substituent to the double bond, the lower the reactivity, and that the reactivity of divinylsilanes would be extremely low. The effect of the catalyst quantity was examined and the data are shown in Fig. 3 . The catalytic activities were directly proportional to the catalyst amount. It was found that a larger amount of catalyst is needed to give reasonable conversion compared with the case of alkene metathesis. The degenerative metathesis due to the large steric hindrance by two substituents at silicon atom occurs more easily by the repulsive interaction at the coordination step between a reactant and carbenes, resulting in the lower reactivity [7]. The effects of substituent at silicon atom on the reactivity were investigated using a flow system under the same reaction conditions (Table 2) . The following order of increasing reactivity was determined when the reactivity was normalized by the number of vinyl groups: diphenyldivinylsilane<diethoxydivinylsilane<tetravinylsilane<dimethyldivinylsilane. This order corresponds to the order of bulkiness of the substituents. 3.5 Effect of silicon atom on reactivity The reactivities of two olefin with a similar structure, trimethylvinylsilane and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, were investigated using a flow system and the result is shown in Fig. 4 . The rapid decrease in activity at the early stage of the reaction shows the adsorption of reactant [11]. The reactivity of trimethylsilylvinylene was much slower than that of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene and the relative reactivity was about 1/4. 4 Summary The ADMET reaction of tetravinylsilane and acyclic divinylsilanes over various kinds of metathesis catalysts has been carried out to synthesize new oligo(silylenevinylene)s with σ–π conjugation. The results will be summarized as follows: 1. Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst promoted with SnBu4 is the only active catalyst for the metathesis of tetravinylsilane and divinylsilanes and new oligo(silylene-vinylene)s with σ–π conjugation were synthesized with high selectivity. WCl6–SnMe4, Grubbs and Schrock catalysts were found to be inactive. 2. The structures of all oligomers were identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The oligomers were found to be σ–π conjugated compounds of acyclic type and no cyclic compounds were formed. 3. The reactivity normalized by the number of vinyl groups increased in the following order: diphenyldivinylsilane<diethoxydivinysilane<tetravinylsilane<dimethyldivinylsilane. This order agrees essentially with the steric hindrance of substituents. 4. The compound containing silicone atom lowered the reactivity greatly.
