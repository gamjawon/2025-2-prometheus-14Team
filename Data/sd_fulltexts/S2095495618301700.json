Boron had been introduced into the structure of carbon material (BC), which was used as the support of Pd catalyst for hydrogenation of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA). The physical properties and chemical composition of the support and corresponding catalyst were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, Raman spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), element analysis (EA), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), CO-pulse chemisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results demonstrate that Pd/BC catalyst exhibits a superior activity and good stability due to the more uniform dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, the presence of mesoporous structure and the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the support, compared to carbon and N-doped carbon supported Pd catalysts (Pd/C and Pd/NC, respectively). Graphical abstract Pd/B-doped carbon catalyst exhibited superior activity and stability in the hydrogenation of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde due to the highly dispersed fine Pd nanoparticles, the hierarchical structure of support and the enhanced interaction between Pd and support. Image, graphical abstract Keywords Heteroatom-doped carbon Palladium Catalytic hydrogenation Noble metals exhibit high activities in many industrial catalytic processes. It remains a long-pursued goal to achieve a highly dispersed metal nanoparticles or clusters in order to utilize them as efficiently as possible due to the high costs. To this end, a variety of materials have been used as supports to disperse metal species. Among them, carbon materials, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, graphene and other porous carbon, which are known to be relatively chemically inert and exhibit weaker interaction with metal species than oxides, are widely studied as supports for noble metal nanoparticles in many applications. In addition, they possess large surface areas, tunable pore structures, good conductivity and corrosion resistance. As a result, they exhibited excellent performance as supports in e.g. Li–air batteries, catalytic conversion of syngas, Heck reaction and proton exchange membrane fuel cell [1–7]. Beyond that, noble metals can be easily retrieved by burning off carbon supports when the catalysts are deactivated. However, the relatively weaker interaction of carbon support with the metal species is also one disadvantage because this frequently leads to aggregation and/or leaching of metal species particularly at high temperature [8,9]. This could result in gradual deactivation of these catalysts over a period of time. To date, a variety of methods have been developed to modify the surface of relatively inert carbon in order to improve the durability of metal catalysts, such as strong acid oxidation [10], plasma treatment [11], grafting of polymer [12] and heteroatom doping [13]. It was widely demonstrated that doping of carbonaceous materials with heteroatoms, e.g. nitrogen, boron, phosphorus and sulfur, introduces a large number of defect sites on their surfaces, which frequently modifies their electronic, chemical and physical properties. The defect sites may act as anchoring sites for metal nanoparticles. In addition, the perturbed electronic structures around these defect sites could enhance the host-guest interaction, consequently improving the stability of catalyst [14–16]. For example, Chizari et al. reported that N-doped carbon nanotubes helped to promote the dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, which exhibited a much higher catalytic activity and better selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde when compared with the undoped carbon nanotubes supported Pd catalyst [17]. Similar to N-doping, B atoms can also be easily incorporated into the carbon lattice due to its comparable atomic size with carbon. Ravat et al. reported that the doping of B into hollow carbon spheres not only facilitated the dispersion of noble metal nanoparticles and enhanced the interaction between metal and supports, but also improved the thermal stability of the support [18]. Herein, we doped carbon with B atoms and studied its effect on the catalytic performance of Pd catalyst in the hydrogenation of 4-CBA. Hydrogenation of 4-CBA is a key step to obtain pure terephthalic acid (PTA), which is the raw material for manufacturing polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a widely used commodity. The coconut activated carbon supported Pd remains the most effective catalyst for this reaction. However, under the harsh industrial reaction conditions (280 °C and 7 MPa), Pd species aggregate gradually and also go through leaching, which will lead to deactivation. Development of an even more active and much more durable catalyst remains the long-pursued goal for this reaction. In this report, we used glucose which is a cheap and environmentally friendly biomass material as the raw material for synthesis of carbonaceous support. Then B atoms were doped into carbon material using boric acid (BA) as the boron source, which is facile and relatively safe compared to the toxic boron trichloride and triethylborane. The resulting Pd/B-doped carbon is much more active and more durable than Pd/N-doped carbon and Pd/pristine carbon in the hydrogenation of 4-CBA, which exhibits potential for this application. Pristine carbon (denoted as C) was prepared by calcining glucose in a tube furnace. Typically, 3.0 g D-(+)-glucose (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was treated for 1 h at 300 °C, and then for 2 h at 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min and an Ar flow rate of 100 mL/min. Then the sample was cooled down to room temperature. N-doped carbon (abbreviated as NC) was synthesized via a facile pyrolysis method with glucose as the carbon source and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as the nitrogen source. Briefly, 3.0 g D-(+)-glucose and 2.0 g HMTA (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were mixed with distilled water under vigorous stirring to get a uniform mixture. After drying at 60 °C, the obtained mixture was calcined following the same heating procedure as for the C sample. To prepare B-doped carbon (abbreviated as BC), glucose was used as the carbon source and BA was used as the boron source. In a typical process, 3.0 g D-(+)-glucose and 1.6 g BA (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were well mixed with distilled water under magnetic stirring. The drying and calcination procedures were the same as that for NC. The thus obtained material was rinsed with a copious amount of boiling distilled water and anhydrous ethanol to remove the residual boron oxide, and finally desiccated at 110 °C overnight. For comparison, the B-doped carbon support without subjected to washing with boiling water and anhydrous ethanol is denoted as BC'. Before loading Pd nanoparticles, all the support materials were grinded into powder. The supported Pd catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. An aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of PdCl2 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used as the precursor. After drying at 110 °C, it was reduced for 2 h at 250 °C under H2 atmosphere. The loadings of Pd were set at 0.5 wt% for all catalysts. N2-physisorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using an Autosorb-iQ2 apparatus. The specific surface areas were estimated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the pore volumes and pore size distributions. Raman spectra were collected on a Bruker Optic Senterra Raman spectrometer with 532 nm laser. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed with a PerkinElmer Optima 7300 DV instrument to measure the actual Pd loadings. Element analysis (EA) was conducted using a Horiba EMGA-930 instrument. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope with a 200 kV accelerating voltage. CO-pulse chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured by a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with Al Kα radiation. The hydrogenation reaction of 4-CBA (TCI Development Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was carried out in a 100 mL Parr autoclave under 0.5 MPa H2 and 0.1 MPa Ar at 100 °C. 20 mg catalyst and 200 mg 4-CBA were added to 70 mL distilled water and loaded into the reactor. After removing the air from the reactor by purified Ar, the reactor was pressurized with Ar to 0.4 MPa at room temperature. When it was heated up to 100 °C, part of purified Ar was released and purified H2 was injected into it. At the same time, the timer and the mechanical stirrer started working. The effluents were withdrawn from the reactor every 10 min and analyzed by Agilent 1260 Infinity LC. The catalyst stability was investigated by aging the fresh catalysts in 70 mL deionized water for 24 h at 200 °C and 1.5 MPa H2 under stirring. Subsequently, the activity of the aged catalysts was tested and compared with the fresh catalysts under the same conditions. The specific surface area (SSA) of all the supports is estimated by the BET method and the results are summarized in Table 1 . The undoped C exhibits a low SSA (∼80.7 m2 g−1). The SSA of NC decreases when N atoms are present in the carbon framework (∼63.9 m2 g−1) and it further decreases to only ∼13.6 m2 g−1 in the presence of B doping (BC'). Interestingly, its SSA jumps up as high as ∼1400.0 m2 g−1 and its porosity to ∼0.68 cm3 g−1 when BC' is subjected to washing with boiling distilled water (BC). This material exhibits a hierarchically microporous and mesoporous structure. Its pore size distribution has two maxima at 1.4 and 2.7 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 ). By contrast, the SSA of C and NC exhibit almost no change upon the same washing with boiling water. These results indicate that H3BO3 not only acts as a dopant precursor, but also as a pore-directing agent. The rinsing process with boiling distilled water generates pores in the carbon support when the residual boron oxide is removed. In addition, some water is also produced from H3BO3 during the thermal treatment process, which may also contribute to the pore formation [19–21]. Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to study the structural properties of carbon materials. The Raman spectra in Fig. 2 show two peaks at 1350 and 1592 cm−1 for all three supports, which are the characteristic D and G bands, respectively, of carbon materials. The D band is generally induced by defect sites, while G band is ascribed to the stretching modes of sp 2-hybridized carbon. They indicate that all three supports possess basic structure of sp 2-hybridized network. The intensity ratio of the D and G band (I D/I G) is usually used to evaluate the amorphous state of carbon materials. The high value of I D/I G (3.01, 3.84 and 3.03 for C, NC and BC, respectively) indicates that these three supports contain a large amount of defects. In addition, the larger I D/I G value of NC suggests more defect sites. The similar I D/I G value of BC with C is likely due to the low B content doped into the C framework. ICP–OES analysis is used to determine the Pd loadings in these catalysts and the results are listed in Table 2 . The Pd loadings on C, NC and BC supports are similar, i.e. 0.43, 0.43 and 0.47 wt%, respectively. Furthermore, ICP analysis indicates that the B content in Pd/BC catalyst is about 1.8 wt%, which is much higher than many other B-doped carbon materials prepared at the same or higher temperatures [19,22]. It suggests that our preparation method of B-doping is efficient. Element analysis shows that the Pd/NC catalyst contains ca. 11.9 wt% N, which is much higher than the B content in Pd/BC. HRTEM images in Fig. 3 show that the Pd particles on C and NC supports are not uniform. They exhibit a wide particle size distribution ranging from 1.5 to 41.9 nm. In comparison, the Pd particles on BC disperse much more uniformly, and the particle size is much smaller than that on C and NC. A histogram is obtained based on more than 200 particles by scanning randomly across the electron microscopic specimen and the result is displayed in the inset of Fig. 3(c). One can see that the particle size ranges between 0.8 and 3.2 nm averaged at 1.8 nm for Pd/BC. It is well known that heteroatom doping into the carbonaceous materials can generate defect sites and these defects act as effective anchoring sites for metal nanoparticles [15]. According to the results of CO-pulse chemisorption, the dispersion of Pd particles on these three supports follows the sequence of: BC (41.0%) > NC (3.9%) > C (2.9%), which is consistent with the HRTEM results. It demonstrates that the dispersion of Pd/BC is significantly higher than Pd/NC although there are also plenty of defect sites on the surface of NC support as indicated by Raman spectra. Therefore, there must be other factors influencing the dispersion of Pd particles. For example, the large SSA of BC support may be favorable for the high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. To understand the effect of SSA on the dispersion of Pd on BC support, Pd particles were also dispersed on BC' support. The result shows that Pd particles are uniformly dispersed on BC', indicating that B doping is important for uniform dispersion of Pd species. However, the Pd particle size over the BC' support (Fig. 3d) is a little larger than that over BC, suggesting that the surface area may not be the decisive factor for uniform dispersion of Pd species but important to obtain smaller particles. In addition, the hierarchically microporous and mesoporous structure of BC may be another factor for the smaller and uniform Pd particles. More importantly, the defects do not only act as the anchoring sites for metal particles, but also enhance the binding strength between metal atoms and carbon supports. Acharya et al. reported that the d band center of Pt or Ru on the B-doped graphene was closest to the Fermi energy, compared to the undoped one and N-doped one, resulting in the strongest interaction between Pt or Ru and the support [23]. Other theoretical studies also predicted that the binding strength of Pd atoms to B-doped carbon supports was stronger than that on the N-doped ones due to the stronger interaction between their electron orbitals [24,25]. This could reduce the migration and hinder the aggregation of Pd particles on BC support during the catalyst preparation process. Thus, Pd/BC is expected to exhibit a higher stability as well under harsh reaction conditions, which will be discussed in the following. The chemical states of the catalysts are studied by XPS. The N 1 s spectrum of Pd/NC (Fig. 4 a) displays that there are four types of N species: pyridinic-N (398.1 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.4 eV), quaternary-N (400.7 eV) and N-oxide (402.3 eV). The high-resolution B 1 s spectrum of Pd/BC (Fig. 4b) is deconvoluted into three peaks located at 188.6, 191.4 and 192.8 eV, which can be attributed to BC3, BCO2 and B-O species, respectively. The Pd 3d spectra in Fig. 4(c) show Pd 3d 5/2 and Pd 3d 3/2 doublets. For the Pd 3d spectrum of Pd/C, the doublet at 335.9 and 341.1 eV is assigned to metallic Pd, and the doublet located at 336.8 and 342.1 eV is attributed to Pd2+. The chemical states of Pd supported on NC are analogous to that of Pd/C. Nevertheless, the deconvolution of the Pd 3d spectrum of Pd/BC indicates that the Pd 3d binding energy of Pd/BC shifts toward a higher energy. For example, the binding energy of Pd2+ species is 0.5 eV higher than that of Pd2+ on the Pd/C catalyst. This phenomenon is consistent with previous theoretical studies, which predicted that B-doping leads to easier charge transfer from the metal clusters to the carbon supports compared to the undoped or N-doped C [26,27]. In addition, the smaller particle size of Pd on BC may also contribute to the higher binding energy, as Zhang et al. and Zhou et al. reported for Pt and Pd [28,29]. These authors reported that the binding energy of Pt 4f and Pd 3d shifted to a higher energy with decreasing their particle sizes. The activities of Pd/C, Pd/NC and Pd/BC in 4-CBA hydrogenation are displayed in Fig. 5 . After reaction for 40 min, the conversion of 4-CBA reaches 77.1% when Pd/BC is used as the catalyst. In comparison, the conversion is only 29.4% and 52.9% for Pd/C and Pd/NC, respectively. It is obvious that Pd/BC exhibits a much higher catalytic activity than those of Pd/C and Pd/NC. Although all these catalysts exhibit a similar Pd loading, Pd/BC exhibits the most uniform distribution of Pd nanoparticles and smallest averaged particles size compared to Pd/NC and Pd/C, as evidenced by HRTEM and CO-pulse chemisorption. It appears that their catalytic activity is related with the dispersion of Pd particles. In addition to the higher dispersion of Pd particles, mass transfer can be also enhanced by the mesoporous structure [30,31] of BC support, which is also beneficial for the reaction. The durability is another critical concern for the applications, which is investigated by aging under harsh conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, after aging in water under high temperature and high hydrogen pressure (200 °C and 1.5 MPa) for 24 h, the conversion of 4-CBA decreases to 60.4% for Pd/BC, while it drops to 4.8% for Pd/C and 11.9% for Pd/NC. It is seen that Pd/BC presents the best stability and only decreases approximately by 21.6% after aging, while Pd/C shows the worst stability and nearly loses its hydrogenation activity completely after aging. For carbon-based materials supported Pd catalysts, two reasons are frequently reported to be responsible for the deterioration of catalysts: the aggregation and leaching of Pd particles [32]. Fig. 6 shows the sizes and distributions of aged Pd catalysts. There are some Pd particles with a rather large size forming in aged Pd/C whereas there is less severe change in Pd/NC and Pd/BC, indicating aggregation of Pd particles over Pd/C and stabilized Pd particles on heteroatom-doped carbon supports. Further comparison between the data in Figs. 3 and 6 shows that less Pd particles are observed on the aged Pd/C and Pd/NC compared to the fresh catalysts, whereas this is not observed for Pd/BC. ICP results show that Pd is leached after aging. For example, Pd is leached by 89.8% and 34.9% for aged Pd/C and Pd/NC, respectively. In contrast, the Pd/BC is significantly more durable since there is only 2.1% Pd leached during the aging process. It is obvious that doping of B into the carbon framework is more effective than N-doping to enhance the interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the supports and thus to alleviate the leaching of Pd. This is in accordance with the previous theoretically predicted results [16,23–25]. We have developed a facile and effective method to introduce N and B heteroatoms into the carbon framework forming N- and B-doped carbon, which can be used as supports for Pd catalysts in the hydrogenation of 4-CBA. The resulting Pd/BC catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic activity and significantly improved stability. This is likely due to the high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles, the presence of mesoporous structure in support and the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the support. The results demonstrate that B-doped carbon is a promising catalyst support material for catalytic applications where the noble metal nanoparticles suffer from aggregation and leaching under harsh conditions.
