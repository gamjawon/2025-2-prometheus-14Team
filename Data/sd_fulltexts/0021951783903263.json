BJORKLUND AND INGEMAR LUNDSTR Laboratory of Applied Physics, Department of Physics and Measurement Technology, Linkoping Institute of Technology, S-581 83 Linking, Sweden Received June 24, 1982; revised September 27, 1982 Electrical conductivities were measured for several catalytic materials during reactions of indus- trial interest. It is shown that conductivity changes can be used to monitor both the composition of gaseous reactants in contact with catalysts and how catalysts are altered by the reactants. Most significant is the result that certain commercial supported metal catalysts, in which the major component is an insulating oxide such as SiOz or A12, exhibit large differences in conductivity when contacted with oxidizing and reducing gases. This phenomenon is illustrated for supported Ni and Co catalysts in monitoring catalyst metal/oxide composition in Oi and H; and also the effect of H;S during the reaction of H 2 and CO. In addition, it is shown that coke deposited on insulating catalysts such as those used in hydrodesulfurization greatly increases the catalysts' conductivity and this can be used to observe the removal of coke by an oxidizing gas. Results for three semiconductor catalysts are presented in order to further illustrate the concept of electrical sensi- tivity of catalytic materials. These include descriptions of the effect ofH;S on ZnO, the changes in promoted Fezt^ during the conversion of ethylbenzene to styre, and the response of bismuth molybdate to propene/oxygen mixtures. INTRODUCTION One approach commonly taken in inter- preting observations made in heteroge- neous catalysis is to make use of the elec- tronic theory of catalysis. Generally this involves attempts to correlate observed catalytic activities with bulk electronic properties. Such treatment of catalytic phe- nomena has been applied to pure metals (/), alloys (2), and semiconductor (3, 4) materi- als. For semiconductor catalysts, much work has been done to relate catalyst activities to collective electronic properties such as fer- romagnetism, ferroelectricity, conductiv- ity, and position of the Fermi level and band gaps. Examples of this approach can be found in the literature for NiO (5), Fe^ (6), ZnO (7), Mo03 (o), CoFe204 (9), and Sn02-Sb204 (70). In addition, a review has been published on utilizing electrical prop- erties in some cases to study transient re- sponse in heterogeneous catalysis (II). Conductivity measurements done on cat- alysts under reaction conditions are de- scribed in a number of the references listed above. Such measurements carried out on polycrystalline powder samples do not pro- vide intrinsic bulk values of the material but rather give an estimate of the main charge carrier concentration. Quantitative correla- tion with catalyst activity is difficult be- cause of the uncertainty in interpretation of intergranular resistance and mobility changes. In addition, the higher surface ar- eas of catalytic materials relative to sin- tered samples result in surface effects predominating. Therefore, conductivity changes of catalysts in contact with gas- eous reactants are generally useful for qual- itative description of events rather than as a basis for quantitative comparison with the- ory (7). We used such a qualitative approach to in situ conductivity measurements in order to investigate a number of industrially impor- tant catalyst systems.

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF CATALYSTS 315 been not to obtain a complete picture of electrical transport properties, but more practically, to demonstrate that conductiv- ity measurements can be usefully corre- lated with catalytic phenomena. Some pos- sible models for the conductivity changes in real catalyst pellets are, however, dis- cussed and related to the structure of sup- ported catalyst material. While this paper describes results for a single-pellet reactor, our long-range goal is to show that in a typical fixed-bed reactor several catalyst tablets acting as sensors along the bed could provide input informa- tion for a monitor system which could be used to continuously control reaction con- ditions for maximum product formation. Some of the catalysts were investigated more completely in order to obtain informa- tion on the nature of the charge transport in the catalysts. A brief discussion on the physical basis for the electrical conductiv- ity changes is therefore also given. EXPERIMENTAL Conductivity measurements were done in a stainless-steel cell constructed of two Balzers high-vacuum flanges (1.33 in.). The top flange held two g-in. stainless-steel tubes as gas inlet and outlet. The bottom flange had a Feldmle oxide-ceramic ul- trahigh-vacuum current feedthrough welded in place. A goldplated copper gasket was used to seal the cell. The base of the bottom flange was goldplated and it served as the bottom contact of the catalyst sample. The top con- tact was a stiff goldplated tungsten wire connected to the insulated electrode. Both the reactor base and wire electrode were in contact with thick gold films which were evaporated onto the sample prior to use. Proper contact between electrodes and sample is an important consideration in making conductivity measurements on granular materials. Our usual test of con- tact was to check the linearity of the cur- rent versus voltage response at conditions where the catalyst was fairly conducting. Direct current measurements were done by applying l V from a B3000 Ultronix power supply across the catalyst in series with a decade resistor and measuring the voltage drop across the decade resistor (1-100 k). The decade resistor, r^, was always cho- sen to give a voltage drop across it, Va, much smaller than l V (^50 mV). During these conditions the conductance of the catalyst sample is given by G (mS) = (Yd (mV)/rd (ohm). Ar, H2, 02, CO, C3H6, and 1% HzS/Ar were obtained in cylinders from Alfax AB and used without further purification. Eth- ylbenzene and n-heptane were of reagent grade from Merck and were passed over the catalyst by saturating an Ar carrier gas at room temperature. Catalyst activities were measured by injecting the reactor effluent at intervals from a Carle sampling valve into a Perkin-Elmer 800 gas chromoto- graph equipped with a flame detector. For propene oxidation, reaction products were also introduced into a Micromass Q 200 mass spectrometer by means of a capillary so that COz concentrations could be mea- sured. All reactions were done at atmospheric pressure. We report gas velocities and cata- lyst weights under Results although the concept of space velocity is not very mean- ingful for a one-pellet reactor. Temperature was measured by means of a chromel-alu- mel thermocouple connected to the exter- nal reactor wall. The reactor was placed up- right in a resistively heated furnace during the experiments. Catalysts used were obtained from the following manufacturers: Harshaw, United Catalysts Inc., Shell, Naico, Linde, and Ketjen. The samples were -pe- or g-in. tab- lets and g- or A-in. extrudates. We also pre- pared our own a-2Biz03 3Mo03 oxidation catalyst (72) and ZnO sulfur removal mate- rial (7) according to procedures described elsewhere.

RESULTS We describe here six different systems where we observed changes in catalyst con- ductance as a function of reaction condi- tions. In addition, we mention two systems where we expected to observe some re- sponse but did not. Response of Supported Ni and Co to Oi-H-i Mixtures Supported catalysts containing Ni and Co are sold commercially for hydroga- tion reactions such as methanation, finish- ing of fats and oils, conversion of benzene to cyclohexane, and others. Generally these catalysts contain 20-70 wt% metal and 80-30% oxide support (SiOz or AhC^) and often are supplied in a prereduced form, stabilized with adsorbed COz, so that activation is accomplished by heating to 200-300 in an inert atmosphere. Certain members of this catalyst group were observed to exhibit a change in con- ductance upon being oxidized and reduced at elevated temperatures. As shown in Ta- ble I, two members of the group available to us ranging from Ketjen -y-AlzC^ (0% metal) to Harshaw's Ni-1404 (68% Ni) were active electrically. As shown in the table, the two electrically active catalysts, UCI's G62RS and Harshaw's Ni-0104T, were quite differ- ent in metal content. The manner of response of the two active catalysts was also quite different. G62RS was insulating at 20 at our most sensitive scale (1 nS) and maintained its insulating character when heated in Ar (to desorb COz) and also in Hz. In Oz it became quite conducting. We show in Fig. 1 that the cat- alyst's conductivity can be used to follow its apparent degree of oxidation in different Oz-Hz mixtures. The data were obtained using a computerized gas mixing apparatus to systematically control a flow of Ar, Oz, and Hz over the catalyst at 400 (13). Dur- ing the experiment the Hz content of the flow was 1.5% and the Oz content was var- ied linearly (25-min on, 5-min off intervals) from 0.4 to 2.0%. Total gas flow was con- stant at 200 cmVmin. As shown in the fig- ure, each higher Oz addition to the flow re- sulted in an increase in the catalyst's conductance. During the 5-min Oz-off pe- riod the catalyst returned to its original in- sulating condition. We found the conduc- tance to be 80 p,S in pure Oz and 40 nS in pure Hz. We checked the contribution of thermoelectric power to the data by remov- ing the l V applied across the sample and found it to be about 2% (9).

Response ofG62RS at 400 to a gas stream composed of a constant 1.5 vol% H2 and Oi content varied as shown along the X axis, diluted in Ar. For each concentration, 0; was on for 25 min and off for 5 The other electrically active catalyst, Harshaw's Ni-0104T, behaved quite differ- ently. After being heated to elevated tem- perature in Ar, Ni-0104T remained very conducting both in Ar and in pure Hz. A number of treatments in Oz and H^ were required to condition the catalyst so that it would respond to 0; in a similar manner as G62RS. In Fig. 2 we show a typical treat- ment sequence at 425 necessary to trans- form the catalyst (A-in.) into a sensor con- dition (l min 02, Ar flush, Hz cycles). It is important to note that the other Harshaw catalysts listed in Table I, Ni-3210T and Ni- 1404T, could not be changed from their conducting state using the same procedure described in Fig. 2. We also tested tablets from another prep- aration batch of Ni-0104T (s-in) and found them to be similarly electrically active. This would seem to indicate good reproducibil- ity in the manufacturing process with re- gard to the electrical properties of the cata- lysts. However, when we pulverized some A-in. tablets and repacked them at 400 kg/ cm2, the ability to respond to Hz-Oz even after the treatment cycles was lost. It should also be noted that these mea- surements were done on tablets cut in half so that one electrode was in contact with the center of the catalyst. Oftentimes, tab- lets have a hard outer skin which may have some influence on the observed electrical properties. Response of Supported Ni and Co to H^S during CO + H^ Reaction A serious problem in a number of cata- lytic processes, such as upgrading of coal- derived synthesis gas, is the deactivation of the catalyst by sulfur compounds present in the feed. A number of papers have de- scribed such catalyst deactivation (14-17), and work is continuing in an effort to under- stand the mechanism of both sulfur poison- ing and regeneration for methanation and Fischer Tropsch catalysts. The catalysts described in the previous section as responding to Oz-Hz mixtures were also observed to change conductance upon the introduction of HzS into a mixture of H; and CO passing over the catalyst. In Fig. 3 we show the change in conductivity of Ni-0104T (previously pretreated as de- scribed in Fig. 2) when HzS was added to the system. A mixture of 24 cmVmin Hz and 5.5 cmVmin CO was passed over a 70-mg pellet at 275 and the hydrocarbon prod- FIG. 2.

Response of Ni-0104 at 275 to 200 ppm H2S (in at (= 0) in a stream of H; and CO. Numbers along the curve represent hydrocarbon product normalized to the production at ( = 0. Initial response to H;S after 1 hr was recorded on the nanosiemens scale. uct was measured at intervals by the FID detector. After 1 to 2 hr to establish a steady-state product formation HzS was in- troduced into the reaction stream at ~200 ppm (t = 0 in Fig. 3). The catalyst contin- ued to be insulating for about 1 hr, but then exhibited a sharp response to the HzS on the nanosiemens scale. We then followed the conductance increase on the 10-mS scale for several hours. The hydrocarbon production normalized to 1 at t = 0 is shown as numbers along the curve. As shown in the figure, catalyst deactiva- tion was observed before the first indication of change in conductance. The increase in conductance was halted by stopping the HiS input to the reactants. The final con- ductance level reached in Fig. 3 was stable in flowing H; overnight. However, raising the temperature to 375 caused it to de- crease (Fig. 4), but not back to its original highly resistive state. G62RS exhibited a similar response to H under the same reaction conditions. It mS 10 375 -HO- IS Hours PIG. 4. Response of Ni-0104 poisoned by H;S as described in Fig. 3 to treatment in pure flowing H2 at 275 and then later at 375. ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF CATALYSTS 319 did not deactivate to the same level as Ni- 0104T for 200 ppm H2S in the feed, but again the highly conducting state caused by the -tS was stable in H2 at 275. How- ever, G62RS could be returned to its origi- nal highly insulating state by further treat- ment in H2 at 350. In light of the fact that the usual concen- tration of HzS discussed in the literature for poisoning the CO + H; reaction is 1-10 ppm (75), it is perhaps necessary to men- tion what we observed regarding the sensi- tivity to HsS of the catalysts investigated. Although we did not adequately explore the H2S partial pressure-temperature relation- ship of the systems, it was clear that lower temperatures favored higher sensitivity. First response to H;S on our most sensitive scale was observed for G62RS at 275 af- ter 1-2 hr in -200 ppm H2S, after 3-4 hr in ~80 ppm HzS, and after about 14 hr in 0 ppm HzS. The slow response suggests that a spe- cial-purpose thin-film sensor of the cata- lysts could be an interesting alternative as a faster monitor for the poisoning of the cata- lyst. first exposure to 0; because of the reaction exothennicity). However, by determining the weight loss of several samples after further treatment at 550 in air, it was found that the observed decrease in conductance down to the level of an uncoked, fresh catalyst was caused by a loss of only 10-20% of the total coke on the catalyst. Thus one must be careful in interpreting such data, since if the coke re- moval had been done at 550 a direct rela- tionship between total coke removal and loss of conductance would have been in- ferred, whereas it appears that the conduc- tance level of the coked catalysts relative to the clean is actually due to only a fraction of the coke present (which is removable at 400). Unfortunately we were not able to ob- serve coke buildup on the catalysts because the C2H2 decomposition reaction also de- posited coke across the insulating ceramic of the electrode in the reactor cell which resulted in false conductance levels. On the other hand, this indicates that the buildup of coke is generally possible to detect by electrical measurements. Conductance of Coke on Hydrotreating Catalysts A A-in. extrudate of Naico NM 504 hy- drotreating catalyst (4 wt% Ni, 13 wt% Mo on A12 support) which was insulating at 20 was found to exhibit no response to H2 or 02 at 400. Several extrudates were separately exposed to a gas mixture of 5% C2H2 in Ar at 400 for 2 hr and cooled in flowing Ar. Catalyst weight gain was about 14%. These were then tested in the conduc- tivity cell and its was observed that after the C2H2 treatment the catalysts exhibited a conductance level of 1-10 ^S in Ar at 400 and that the conductance could be de- creased to as low as 10 nS by 30 min treat- ment in 1-5% 0; in Ar. We attribute this decrease in conductance to the removal of some coke from the catalyst (an initial in- crease in conductance was observed upon Response ofZnO to H^S in Hi Pure ZnO in extrudate form is used to purify gas streams such as natural gas and naphtha containing H2S. Sulfur removal is accomplished by converting the oxide to sulfide and it is thus not a catalytic process. The usual configuration is to place the ex- trudates in trays with the gas entering the top of the reactor. Operating conditions are up to 50 psig and 400. As has already been mentioned, much work has been done on investigating the electrical properties of ZnO under catalytic reaction conditions (7). We also observed that when ZnO is exposed to HzS in a re- ducing environment, the apparent accumu- lation of S in the solid can be observed by monitoring the change in conductivity. In Fig. 5 we show this result. A 70-mg pellet of ZnO at 325 was found to have a conduc- 320 BJORKLUND AND LUNDSTR FIG. 5. Response ofZnO at 325 to 300 ppm H;S in Hi carrier gas. tivity level of 10 (AS in Oz. In 75 cm^min H2 the conductance level increased to 50 ms, but addition of 300 ppm HsS into the gas flow (t = 0) caused a decrease in the con- ductivity as shown in the figure. When HiS was removed, there was an initial small in- crease in conductivity to a constant level for 6 hr, followed by a slow increase to 50 ms after 20 hr. Response of Promoted Fe^Oz during Styre Production An important reaction in the petrochemi- cal industry is the dehydrogenation of eth- ylbenzene to styre. The most effective styre catalysts are promoted iron oxides. The reaction is run at about 600, 1 atm pressure, and with a high molar ratio (>10) of steam to ethylbenzene (EB). The steam in the reaction stream serves several pur- poses. As a diluent it shifts the equilibrium- controlled system to higher styre conver- sion, it removes coke from the surface, supplies heat for the endothermic reaction, and as an oxidant equilibrates the catalyst to an oxidation state most effective for styre production. An extensive review describing iron ox- ide catalysts has been published by Lee (7o'). He described several aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction, including the electronic factor with respect to promoter ions in the lattice. Contact potentials were measured for catalysts containing different alkali and alkaline earth cations after expo- sure to a reaction mixture at 600 and quenching in Ar. In an earlier note, Lee also described Seebeck emf measurements at 600 on compacted powders of Zn and Zr containing catalysts (/9). Shell 105 (7% K.20, 2% Cr203, 91% Fez03) is one of the commercial catalysts used for styre production. For this type of catalyst it has been shown that Fe203 is in fact converted to Fe304 during use. Wa- ter vapor added to the system and Hs from the reaction equilibrate the catalyst: H: H; Fe2C>3 ^=^ Fes04 ^=^ FeO. HzO H Catalysts are more active and selective for styre production after they have \"aged\" (become reduced), and oftentimes prere- duction with H2 or NH3 is done on a new catalyst charge. We followed such catalyst improvement with time by observing the conductance change of Shell 105 during exposure to an H20/EB/Ar mixture (10/1/80 molar, 30 cmV min total flow) at 600. Products were in- troduced into the gas Chromatograph from a heated sampling valve and separated on a 6- ft DC-200, 15% on Chrom W column at 80. One can see in Fig. 6 that the wt% styre in the reactor effluent relative to ethylbenzene, benzene, and toluene in- creased as the catalyst conductivity in- creased. At 600 the conductivity level was 0.5 mS in Oz and 40 mS in Hz. A short circuit in our system is 120 mS (due to con- tact resistances etc.), which indicates that the reduced catalyst is almost a metallic conductor in agreement with Lee (18). One other styre catalyst, UCI's G-64 (20% K.2C03, 2.5% Mo03, 5% Ce02, 60% Fe203), exhibited a similar response to oxi- dation and reduction. ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF CATALYSTS 321 FIG. 6. Response of Shell 105 at 600 during the conversion ofethylbenzene to styre. Numbers along the curve represent the wt% styre product relative to ethylbenzene, benzene, and toluene in the reactor effluent. Response of Bismuth Molybdate to Propene-Oz Mixtures Another important reaction in the petro- chemical industry is the selective oxidation of olefins to aldehydes and acids. The dis- covery of bismuth molybdate-based cata- lysts for the selective (amm) oxidation of propene (20) has been followed by numer- ous other mixed oxide systems. It is gener- ally agreed that the reactions proceed by incorporation of lattice oxygen in the olefin followed by reoxidation of the lattice from the gas phase (2/). Such a redox mecha- nism has been proven for bismuth molyb- date in that the catalyst will oxidize pro- pene in the absence of gas-phase oxygen and the oxygen so removed in the reaction can be quantitatively replaced. Peacock et al. have published a study of the electrical conductivity of the bismuth molybdate system upon exposure to vari- ous propene-oxygen mixtures (22). We in- cluded our own data here in order to em- phasize how rapidly one can continuously monitor changes in the lattice oxide for this system. We show in Fig. 7 the conductivity changes associated with Oz/propene/Ar flows (cmVmin) of 24/6/70, 15/6/79, and 6/6/ 88 over a 70-mg pellet of ci-2BizOSMoOs at 475. The data were recorded on the 10- (JLS scale. As a comparison, the conduc- tance level of the catalyst in propene/Ar was 50 mS. We added additional catalyst to the reactor (0.5 g total) to obtain sufficient product for analysis. Acrolein formation was about 10 wt% by FID and did not sig- nificantly change with gas composition. Carbon dioxide formation was monitored by mass spectrometry, and the relative peak heights for different gas compositions (normalized to that at 02/propene = 4) are shown in the figure. No Response of Ni-Mo Hydrotreating Catalyst to H-sS in H^ A A-in. extrudate of Nalco NM504 hy- drotreating catalyst was heated to 375 in Ar. At this temperature the catalyst exhib- ited no electrical response to Oz or Hz. A gas stream of Ar/HzS/Hz (cmVmin) (50/0.5/ 25) flowing over the catalyst for several hours caused no change in the conductiv- ity. fS 8- -4 2.5 1 2.5 4 '- 15- Hours FIG. 7.

The zeolite exhibited no response to 02 or Hz. N-Heptane in Ar carrier was passed over the catalyst for several hours, and while de- activation of cracking was observed by GC, there was no change in conductivity due to carbon buildup on the catalyst. Several extrudates were treated at 400 in 5% CzHAr so that weight gain from coke deposition was about 14%. However, these extrudate exhibited a conductance level (nS) essentially the same as uncoked extrudates when heated to 400 in Ar. Temperature Dependence of Conductivity The temperature dependence of the con- ductivity was also investigated for some of the catalysts and the results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In Fig. 8 it is shown that the activation energy for conductance is larger in H2 than in for G62RS. HzS-poisoned catalysts 100mS- after H S 8 8 kcal/mole (0.3eVI ~fe~ 1.8 1000/T FIG. 8.

It was also noted that the conductiv- ity in H2 of G62RS was very similar to that for the pure support A^Oj. Ni-0104 catalyst exhibited no tempera- ture dependence in its untreated nonsensor state (Fig. 9). This same behavior was ob- served for Ni-3210, which, however, could not be transformed into a sensing state. Af- ter the treatment described in Fig. 2, Ni- 0104 exhibited similar activation energies for conduction in both the oxidized and re- duced forms. It should be mentioned that the tempera- ture of the catalysts varies with reaction conditions described in Figs. 1-7 and this certainly contributes to the data. Our pro- cedure of measuring only the external reac- tor temperature was done for convenience and an internal probe on the catalyst sur- face would have been better. However, even then it is questionable if the pellet sur- face temperature is the same as at internal points. We do not feel that it is possible to explain the data by temperature changes. The conductance changes observed are too large and in all cases (except Fig. 1) in the ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF CATALYSTS 323 opposite direction to what is expected from temperature change due to the reaction pro- ceeding on the catalyst surface. DISCUSSION We will limit our discussion mostly to the data concerning the supported metal cata- lysts. Many of the references listed in the introduction describe conductivity mea- surements on semiconducting catalysts. For a material like ZnO it is obvious that changes in composition and/or adsorbed gas species will change the electrical prop- erties. Such metal oxides are commonly used as sensors for gases {23-25). We also point out that, as Ti02 is of current interest as a support material (26, 27), one can ob- serve a similar effect of HzS on Ti02 as that shown for ZnO in Fig. 5. Morrison has shown how the oxidation state (\"Fermilevel\") of metal-oxide cata- lysts can be inferred from the electrical properties of Ti02 used as a support for the catalysts (25). In this case the number of available charge carriers in the semicon- ducting support (TiOz) depends on the Fer- milevel of the catalyst, which thus deter- mines the conductance of a pellet made of the impregnated TiOz. For such a system it is possible to use normal semiconductor physics to describe the changes in conduc- tivity (for example, in its temperature de- pendence) upon oxidation and/or absorp- tion (25). The situation is more complicated for catalysts supported on insulating materials. Both the macroscopic (granularity) and mi- croscopic (metal dispersion) structure will determine the electrical properties of a pel- let. The possible significance of changes in the electrical conductivity of supported metal catalysts was discussed by Thomson and Harvey about ten years ago (29). They showed that the activation energy for con- duction in supported noble metal catalysts was altered after reduction. No change in conductivity was observed upon oxidation and reduction for the low loadings (<5 wt% metal) used. They especially pointed out the possibility of charge transport between a catalytic metal particle and an adsorbate on the support. We observed large differences in conduc- tivities of oxidized and reduced forms of certain catalysts of higher metal content. The temperature dependence of the con- ductivity was also investigated for the cata- lysts and the results are summarized in Figs. 8 and 9. The following was observed for the Co catalyst, G62RS. The activation energy for conduction was larger in the re- duced than the oxidized state. The HzS-poi- soned samples exhibited very little temper- ature dependence. The prefactor Go of the conductance (assuming G = Go^\") was rather similar for the oxidized, reduced, and poisoned samples. This suggests that the rate-limiting step in the conductance is actually an energy barrier and not the sup- ply of charge carriers. This could indicate that it is species adsorbed on or between metal clusters which are responsible for the change in conductance. Furthermore, the change in conductance (Fig. 1) depends strongly on the oxygen pressure, which in- dicates a nonlinear mechanism behind the conductance changes. The nonlinearity can, for example, be due to a competition between hydrogen and oxygen for the same adsorption sites. Another suggestion con- sistent with the oxygen pressure depen- dence and the change in activation energy is given at the end of this section. The nickel catalyst (Fig. 9) exhibited temperature-insensitive conductivity in its untreated nonsensor state. After treatment with Hz and Oz, Ni-0104 showed a low con- ductivity in its reduced form compared with the oxidized form. However, in this case, the activation energies for conduction are about the same, which means that the pre- factors (Go) are quite different for the oxi- dized and reduced states. This fact indi- cates that for this particular catalyst oxidation increases the mobility and/or the number of available charge carriers. One can take the point of view that cata- lyst G62RS can be thought of as being made 324 BJORKLUND AND LUNDSTR up ofp-type C0304 (30 wt% Co) and A^. It is well known that p-Co304 becomes more conducting in oxidizing and less con- ducting in reducing gases (23). However, when one considers the supported Co cata- lyst (which is approximately 10 vol% Co) it is difficult to describe the nature of the con- ducting pathway which yields the data in Fig. 8 for a material which is 90 vol% insu- lating A12. This is particularly puzzling when one considers that Ni-3210 with 35 wt% metal behaves so differently. Our conclusion is, not surprisingly, that each catalyst material manufactured has its own special properties which are a function of the preparational parameters employed. There are only a limited number of publica- tions on how preparation affects final cata- lyst properties for catalysts in our metal content range. What has been reported is that metal surface area passes through a maximum at 30-50 wt% metal (minimum in crystallite size) (30). For metal loadings greater than 5 wt% the crystallite size dis- tribution is broad and even binodal (31). Thus the important microscopic properties of G62RS, results for which are shown in Fig. 8, and Ni-0104, results shown in Figs. 2 and 9, are poorly understood. An observation which may be of general interest in this context was recently re- ported by Ruckenstein and Chen (32). They observed a change in the size of supported metal crystallites during alternating heating in oxygen and hydrogen. One conclusion was that Pd crystallites on alumina films generally became larger in oxygen. The ac- tivation energy for conduction between small metal clusters is known to depend on the size of the clusters (33, 34). Therefore the change of size of supported metal clus- ters can be a general reason why the activa- tion energy should be smaller for the oxi- dized form. Furthermore, if electronic tunneling is also involved in the charge transport, the distance between the sup- ported crystallites is an important parame- ter. One could also apply the results of Ruck- enstein and Chen to explain the behavior of Ni-0104. This catalyst could be viewed as having a Ni metal crystallite distribution af- ter its preparation and reduction, which causes the catalyst to be very conducting and electrically stable upon first exposure to H2 (Fig. 2). However, several cyclic treatments with 0; and H2 alter the original crystallite distribution so that the catalyst behaves like G62RS after the treatments. Sintering could result in an increase in dis- tances between crystallites in the reduced form and thus the resulting insulating be- havior. Ni-3210 and 1404 resist such sinter- ing perhaps because of special additives. With regard to H;S poisoning, the con- cept of surface versus bulk properties of the catalysts must be included in the picture. It is generally agreed that poisoning of Co and Ni catalysts by HzS results in a surface- bonded sulfide which is much more stable than bulk sulfides (14-17). We are unfortu- nately unaware of what species is responsi- ble for the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4. At the rather high H2S partial pressures used it is quite possible that bulk CocSs is forming in the catalyst (35). We do not claim in Fig. 3 that the conductivity change observed is di- rectly related to the poisoning of surface catalytic sites, but rather wish to present the idea that catalyst conductance can be used to monitor the accumulation of sulfur, a poison which can either lower activity or alter selectivity (16, 35, 36). Furthermore, although G62RS could be returned to its originally insulating state by treatment in pure H2 at 350, its original catalytic activ- ity was not restored. The final poison which was monitored by conductivity changes was carbon. Metal- oxide semiconductors have long been known to function as smoke detectors (23). In our study even materials totally unre- sponsive to 02, H2, or H2S at elevated tem- peratures, such as A12 or NM504 hydrotreating catalyst, increased their conductivity when carbon was deposited on their surface. It appears that maximum conductivity obtainable and temperature ELECTRICAL CONDUCTANCE OF CATALYSTS 325 dependence of the conductance are very dependent on the metal content and pre- treatment of the catalyst (37). An interest- ing example of this is the fact that zeolite SK-500 exhibited no conductance change after coking, perhaps because most of the carbon was concentrated in the zeolitic cages and had no possibility to form a con- nective network through the solid. For such materials we suggest that ac-impedance measurements can be an interesting tech- nique to use. Changes in the conductivity in local areas can be observed as an ac capaci- tance and conductance change if the mea- surement frequency is sufficiently high. FURTHER APPLICATIONS In addition to the already described sen- sor uses, the electrical properties described for catalysts of the type listed in Table I may have further applications. Because of the high conductance observed for some of the catalysts listed they could possibly be used as electrodes in batteries or fuel cells, such as the CO-air cell shown in Fig. 11.85 of Ref. (38). For such application the con- ductance, surface area, porosity, and activ- ity would be important in determining elec- trode efficiency. Certain catalysts exhibit improved per- formance after they have been oxidized and reduced several times prior to use. It is of- ten speculated that such pretreatment alters the surface area or texture of the catalyst. One could take this approach further by considering the data in our Fig. 2. The sev- eral oxidation/reduction cycles necessary to transform Ni-0104 to a sensor state can also be used as a pretreatment procedure to sequentially change the catalyst from a con- ducting to an insulating material (stable in Hi at the end of each cycle). Thus a single catalyst could exhibit a range of activities for hydrogation reactions because its conductance can be varied in a carefully controlled manner. CONCLUSIONS We have shown how the electrical prop- erties of supported and unsupported cata- lysts can be used to monitor their physical state and therefore also their efficiency for certain reactions. We have also found that not all supported catalysts can be used in this way. Some, which do not show any electrical response initially, can, however, be transformed into a \"sensing\" state. The observed phenomena can be used in a practical way for process control and to monitor, for example, sulphur poisoning of catalysts. Specially prepared thin films of such catalytic materials may furthermore be possible for use as chemical sensors in general. Although we have some understanding about the processes behind the conduc- tance changes much more work has to be done to correlate them with the macro- scopic and microscopic properties of the catalysts.

Bjorklund Ingemar Lundström Laboratory of Applied Physics, Department of Physics and Measurement Technology, Linköping Institute of Technology, S-581 83 Linköping, Sweden Electrical conductivities were measured for several catalytic materials during reactions of industrial interest. It is shown that conductivity changes can be used to monitor both the composition of gaseous reactants in contact with catalysts and how catalysts are altered by the reactants. Most significant is the result that certain commercial supported metal catalysts, in which the major component is an insulating oxide such as SiO2 or Al2O3, exhibit large differences in conductivity when contacted with oxidizing and reducing gases. This phenomenon is illustrated for supported Ni and Co catalysts in monitoring catalyst metal/oxide composition in O2 and H2 and also the effect of H2S during the reaction of H2 and CO. In addition, it is shown that coke deposited on insulating catalysts such as those used in hydrodesulfurization greatly increases the catalysts' conductivity and this can be used to observe the removal of coke by an oxidizing gas. Results for three semiconductor catalysts are presented in order to further illustrate the concept of electrical sensitivity of catalytic materials. These include descriptions of the effect of H2S on ZnO, the changes in promoted Fe2O3 during the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene, and the response of bismuth molybdate to propene/oxygen mixtures.
