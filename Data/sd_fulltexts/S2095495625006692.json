Graphical abstract Cohesive energy-guided assembly yields electron-asymmetric Co-Nb dual sites, enabling spatially separated LiPSs adsorption/activation and promoting continuous catalytic conversion via interfacial synergy. Single-atom catalysts are promising for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to their high degree of atomic utilization and strong interactions with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). However, the limited number of active sites and their rapid saturation hinder the continuous adsorption and efficient conversion of LiPSs. Herein, we report a bimetallic catalyst comprising single cobalt atoms (CoSA) and niobium atomic clusters (NbAC) anchored on graphene-like nanosheets (CoSANbAC/NC), which are synthesized via a cohesive energy-driven selective metal aggregation strategy. This dual-site configuration forms an electronically asymmetric interface, where NbAC anchors LiPSs via Coulombic and Lewis acid-base interactions, while CoSA enables S–S bond polarization and cleavage through d-p orbital coupling. The interfacial charge redistribution and orbital coupling between Co and Nb facilitate electron transfer between catalytic sites. Therefore, the S/CoSANbAC/NC cathode maintains a high areal capacity of 6.12 mAh cm−2 after 60 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2. This work demonstrates a rational design strategy for high-performance Li-S cathodes via synergistic bimetallic catalysis. Keywords Single-atom catalyst Sulfur cathode CoSANbAC/NC Lithium-sulfur battery Dual active site 1 Introduction The rapid growth of the new energy sector has led to an explosive increase in the demand for energy storage technologies [1–4]. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, with a theoretical energy density as high as 2600 Wh kg−1 [5–7], abundant sulfur resources, and cost advantages, are considered among the most promising candidates for future energy storage solutions. However, their practical deployment remains severely limited by intrinsic bottlenecks, including the electrical insulation of sulfur and its solid discharge products, the dissolution and shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish reaction kinetics arising from multiphase transitions [8–10]. Accordingly, tackling these challenges is essential for the progress of high-efficiency Li-S battery. Incorporating catalytic sites within carbon matrices has been proven to be an effective approach for overcoming issues in Li-S batteries [11–13]. Conductive carbon frameworks provide continuous electron pathways and mechanical integrity, while embedded catalytic sites accelerate LiPSs redox kinetics and inhibit the shuttle effect [14–16]. Among various catalytic systems, single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen-doped carbon materials have garnered significant attention for their excellent atomic efficiency, tunable electronic properties, and strong interaction with LiPSs [17–20]. In particular, cobalt-based SACs, with their ideally positioned 3d orbitals, effectively promote LiPSs adsorption and conversion [21–23]. However, cobalt single atoms typically exist in saturated coordination environments such as Co–N4, which, combined with their limited site density, leaves little room for further interaction once LiPSs are adsorbed. This leads to rapid site saturation, thereby hindering continuous LiPSs adsorption and reducing its effectiveness in suppressing the shuttle effect [24,25]. Accordingly, the development of novel catalysts featuring multisite adsorption, dynamic electronic regulation, and synergistic catalytic interfaces is essential for further improving the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs. This work presents the design and synthesis of a bimetallic catalytic system (CoSANbAC/NC). Using a cohesive-energy-driven selective metal aggregation strategy, Co single atoms (CoSA) and subnanometer Nb clusters (NbAC) were uniformly anchored onto a nitrogen-doped graphene-like framework. In this system, NbAC functions as a Lewis acidic site that preferentially adsorbs long-chain LiPSs through strong electrostatic interactions, whereas CoSA acts as a catalytic center for S–S bond cleavage. This design enables spatially separated adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, facilitating directional redox kinetics. Therefore, the Li-S battery based on the S/CoSANbAC/NC positive electrode can provide a high area capacity of 6.12 mAh cm−2 with a sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2, and the single-cycle capacity decay is only 0.056%, indicating prominent rate performance. This study proposes a generalizable multifunctional catalytic interface design strategy, providing a new blueprint for high-energy-density and long-term energy storage systems. 2 Results and discussion To enable the coexistence of CoSA and NbAC on a graphene-like framework, an energy-selective clustering strategy was employed. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), metal atoms evolve from isolated precursors into atomic aggregates on a solid substrate. Thermodynamically, the driving force for aggregation is the cohesive energy (E c), as the aggregated state has a lower free energy than isolated atoms. In contrast, the metal-substrate binding energy (E b) acts as a barrier to aggregation since atoms must overcome E b to migrate and cluster. The aggregation tendency is therefore determined by the energy difference ΔE = E c − E b, with larger ΔE values corresponding to stronger aggregation propensities [26–28]. According to this principle, Nb atoms with higher ΔE tend to form clusters, whereas Co atoms, with lower ΔE, remain stabilized as isolated single atoms even under high-temperature sintering (Fig. S1 and Table S1). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that all three samples exhibit characteristic graphite carbon peaks at 26° and 44° [29]. In addition, CoSANbAC/NC and NbAC/NC display distinct diffraction peaks at 36.7°, 42.7°, and 74.3° (Fig. 1b), which correspond to the (111), (200), and (311) planes of metallic Nb, respectively [30,31]. These observations indicate that Nb exists in a clustered metallic state. Raman spectroscopy analysis (Fig. 1c) reveals that the I D/I G intensity ratios of CoSANbAC/NC (0.96) and NbAC/NC (0.99) are slightly lower than that of CoSA/NC (1.01), indicating a reduced defect concentration. This suggests that Nb clusters catalytically induce structural ordering of the carbon framework during heat treatment, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity [32]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 1d and Fig. S2) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. S3) images reveal typical graphene-like nanosheet morphologies across all the samples. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis (Fig. S4) confirms the high specific surface area and porosity of the materials, promoting greater exposure of the active sites. Meanwhile, all three samples exhibit a hierarchical porous architecture comprising both mesopores and micropores. The mesopores facilitate efficient electrolyte penetration and rapid diffusion of lithium polysulfides, while the micropores provide abundant confined adsorption sites that enhance the physical trapping of LiPSs [5,33]. High-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM, Fig. 1e) clearly reveals the coexistence of CoSA and NbAC in CoSANbAC/NC, as highlighted by red and green circles. In contrast, CoSA/NC and NbAC/NC display only isolated single atoms and aggregated clusters, respectively (Fig. S5). Lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.12, 0.21, and 0.24 nm were identified in CoSANbAC/NC, corresponding to the (311), (200), and (111) planes of metallic Nb, respectively [34,35], which is consistent with the XRD and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 1g). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 1h and Fig. S6) reveals that Co atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the CoSANbAC/NC material, whereas Nb exhibits localized aggregation. These results collectively confirm the successful construction of a bimetallic structure comprising Co single atoms and Nb clusters. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) further confirms that the Co and Nb contents were 1.97 wt% and 3.64 wt%, respectively, as shown in Table S2. According to Fig. S7 and Table S2, the elemental contents of C, H, O, and N in the samples were determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). CoSANbAC/NC exhibited distinct Co–N (399.2 eV) and Nb–N (397.8 eV) signals (Fig. S8a), while CoSA/NC and NbAC/NC displayed their respective metal–N coordination peaks (Fig. S8b, c). The electronic states and coordination structures were further probed via X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. Co K-edge XANES spectra revealed that Co species in CoSANbAC/NC possessed a valence state between metallic Co and Co3+, while Nb K-edge XANES indicated that Nb exhibited oxidation states ranging from 0 to +5 (Fig. 2 a, b). In the Fourier transformed (FT) R-space EXAFS spectra, a prominent peak at ∼1.5 Å was assigned to Co–N coordination (Fig. 2c) [23,36], confirming the formation of Co–N bonds without significant Co–Co aggregation. The Nb spectra showed characteristic Nb–N and Nb–Nb contributions at 1.70 and 2.65 Å, respectively (Fig. 2d) [34], indicating that the Nb atoms aggregated and coordinated with nitrogen after high-temperature treatment. Least-squares fitting of the EXAFS data (Fig. 2e) corroborated the atomic dispersion of Co and the formation of Nb clusters. The K-edge fitting curves closely matched the theoretical scattering paths (Co–N, Nb–N, and Nb–Nb) (Fig. S9), and wavelet transform (WT) analysis further verified the uniform dispersion of Co SAs and the aggregation behavior of Nb ACs (Fig. 2f). The simulated EXAFS spectra exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 2g, Table S3), providing strong validation of the proposed Co–N4 coordination and Nb subnanocluster structure. These findings confirm that CoSANbAC/NC has a precisely engineered architecture featuring atomically dispersed Co single sites and clustered Nb domains within a highly ordered carbon matrix. The LiPSs adsorption capacities of the three materials were evaluated through adsorption experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), CoSANbAC/NC exhibited a markedly greater Li2S6 adsorption capability than CoSA/NC and NbAC/NC, as evidenced by the significantly decreased residual Li2S8 concentration detected via ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Further XPS quantitative analysis (Tables S3 and S4, Fig. S10) revealed that the surface sulfur content of CoSANbAC/NC after LiPSs adsorption reached 6.06%, which was significantly greater than that of CoSA/NC (5.41%) and NbAC/NC (5.28%). However, binding energy analysis (Fig. S11) shows that although CoSANbAC/NC exhibits the strongest adsorption capacity, it does not have the highest content of metal–sulfur bonds among the samples. This suggests that the LiPSs anchored in CoSANbAC/NC are not solely governed by Lewis acid-base interactions but also involve significant contributions from physical adsorption via polar-polar interactions. This dual-mode adsorption—originating from strong chemical coordination at Co single-atom sites and electrostatic interactions at Nb clusters—highlights the synergistic effect of the dual-site architecture, resulting in enhanced LiPSs capture and retention. The electrocatalytic activity of the samples was subsequently evaluated via Tafel analysis (Fig. 3b). The CoSANbAC/NC electrode exhibited a significantly higher exchange current density (0.249 mA cm−2) than CoSA/NC (0.112 mA cm− 2) and NbAC/NC (0.135 mA cm− 2), indicating markedly accelerated charge transfer kinetics. Co-Nb synergy increases charge transfer and promotes LiPSs redox kinetics. To further probe the redox dynamics, symmetric cells were assembled and subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (Fig. 3c). All electrodes displayed distinct and reversible redox peaks indicative of the sequential conversion of Li2S8 to short-chain LiPSs and subsequent reoxidation to sulfur. Notably, CoSANbAC/NC exhibited sharper redox peaks with smaller peak-to-peak separations than CoSA/NC and NbAC/NC, reflecting reduced polarization and enhanced reaction kinetics. It is evident from these results that the Co-Nb interface plays a key role in enhancing LiPS conversion kinetics. The catalytic behavior toward Li2S decomposition was further investigated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a three-electrode system with 0.1 M Li2S in methanol as the electrolyte (Fig. 3d). The CoSANbAC/NC electrode exhibited a more negative onset oxidation potential (−0.591 V) than CoSA/NC (−0.533 V) and NbAC/NC (−0.450 V), accompanied by a higher oxidation current density, suggesting a lower energy barrier for Li2S oxidation. Tafel slope analysis (Fig. 3e) further confirmed the enhanced reaction kinetics, with CoSANbAC/NC achieving the lowest Tafel slope (199.9 mV dec−1) among the three samples. These results collectively demonstrate that the CoSANbAC/NC interface facilitates faster electron transfer and more efficient solid-phase Li2S oxidation, thereby accelerating the overall charge–discharge process. The nucleation ability of the materials was evaluated via constant-potential experiments (Fig. 3f–h). Compared with CoSA/NC (6219 s, 0.112 mA) and NbAC/NC (6319 s, 0.116 mA), the CoSANbAC/NC electrode showed a shorter nucleation time (5506 s) and a greater peak current (0.161 mA). Moreover, the LiPSs deposition capacity on CoSANbAC/NC reached 303.5 mAh g−1, substantially outperforming that of CoSA/NC (233.4 mAh g−1) and NbAC/NC (196.1 mAh g−1), reflecting enhanced catalytic efficiency for Li2S nucleation and growth. To further investigate the Li2S precipitation behavior on different materials, I-t transient curves were fitted using electrochemical deposition models. For CoSANbAC/NC (Fig. 3i), the curve exhibits a rapid initial rise closely approaching the 3DP (three-dimensional instantaneous nucleation) model, indicative of a high nucleation rate at the early stage. Unlike classical 3DP behavior, however, the subsequent decay is notably slower, resembling the 2DI (Two-dimensional progressive nucleation) trend [37,38]. This transition indicates a hybrid nucleation behavior, initially dominated by rapid 3D instantaneous nucleation, followed by sustained 2D progressive growth, reflecting enhanced nucleation continuity and spatial uniformity enabled by the dual-site catalyst. In comparison, the profile of CoSA/NC (Fig. 3j) closely matches the 3DI model, consistent with a uniform and temporally continuous nucleation mechanism. By contrast, NbAC/NC (Fig. 3k) follows the 3DP model, with a sharp peak and rapid current decay, indicative of burst-like nucleation and limited growth duration. Post-nucleation SEM observations (Fig. S12) and EDS elemental mapping (Table S5) further confirmed a more uniform and denser distribution of Li2S nuclei on CoSANbAC/NC than on the other samples. Collectively, these results highlight that CoSANbAC/NC exhibits the most favorable balance between nucleation density and temporal persistence. S/CoSANbAC/NC, S/CoSA/NC, and S/NbAC/NC composites were prepared by melt diffusion for use as sulfur cathodes. Fig. S13 presents the sulfur content of the composite materials. The electrochemical redox behavior of the electrodes was investigated via CV at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 4 a). All electrodes displayed distinct and reversible redox peaks associated with sulfur and LiPSs conversion. Notably, the S/CoSANbAC/NC electrode exhibited sharper and more intense peaks than the S/CoSA/NC and S/NbAC/NC electrodes, suggesting enhanced reaction kinetics. Peak potential analysis (Fig. S14) revealed that S/CoSANbAC/NC had the most positive cathodic peak position (I, II) and the most negative anodic peak potential (III, IV), reflecting its superior catalytic efficiency for both LiPSs reduction and Li2S oxidation. The increased current response further corroborated the facilitated kinetics enabled by the S/CoSANbAC/NC interface. The galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles at 0.2 C (Fig. 4b) revealed that S/CoSANbAC/NC delivered an initial capacity of 1200.2 mAh g−1, surpassing that of S/CoSA/NC (1176.7 mAh g−1) and S/NbAC/NC (1090.5 mAh g−1). After 200 cycles, 87.6% of the initial capacity was kept, highlighting outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, S/CoSANbAC/NC exhibited the smallest voltage gap (0.18 V, Fig. 4c), indicative of reduced polarization and enhanced reversibility. The catalytic efficiency for Li2S formation was evaluated by analyzing the capacity ratio between the two discharge plateaus (Q 2/Q 1). S/CoSANbAC/NC demonstrated the highest Q 2/Q 1 ratio (2.24), outperforming S/CoSA/NC (2.15) and S/NbAC/NC (1.69), thus confirming its superior ability to catalyze the conversion of LiPSs to Li2S. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S15) revealed that S/CoSANbAC/NC presented the lowest charge transfer resistance, reflecting facilitated electron/ion transport enabled by the synergistic architecture of Co single atoms and Nb subnano clusters. The long-term cycling performance at 1 C (Fig. 4e) revealed that S/CoSANbAC/NC maintained a high specific capacity of 641.6 mAh g−1 after 800 cycles, corresponding to an ultralow capacity decay rate of only 0.047% per cycle. In addition, rate performance tests demonstrated stable capacities across a wide current range from 0.1 to 3 C (Fig. S16), achieving 745.1 mAh g−1 at 3 C. At all rates, S/CoSANbAC/NC exhibited longer discharge plateaus and smaller voltage hysteresis than the reference electrodes, underscoring its superior catalytic kinetics and robust structure. Encouraged by these results, the practical applicability of S/CoSANbAC/NC was further evaluated under high sulfur loadings. As shown in Fig. 4(g), an areal capacity of 3.31 mAh cm−2 was achieved at a loading of 3.2 mg cm−2, and an impressive capacity of 6.12 mAh cm−2 was maintained at 6.2 mg cm−2 after 60 cycles at 0.1 C. Benchmarking against recently reported cathode materials (Fig. 4h) demonstrated that S/CoSANbAC/NC achieved superior cycling stability and rate performance [2,7,39–46]. These advances are attributed to the synergistic dual-metal architecture, which simultaneously promotes efficient LiPSs adsorption-conversion dynamics, enhances catalytic robustness, and effectively mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect. To understand the catalytic performance of CoSANbAC/NC, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed. Fig. 5 (a) reveals that S/CoSANbAC/NC shows intermediate LiPSs binding affinity compared with the reference materials. This facilitates a favorable balance between adsorption and desorption, preventing the blockage of catalytic sites. The adsorption geometry shown in Fig. S17 further confirms that Nb nanoclusters and Co single atoms cooperatively anchor the sulfur chain through dual-site interactions, forming a spatially coordinated and electronically coupled configuration. To further validate the adsorption advantage of the dual-site catalyst, various intermediate configurations were constructed (Fig. S18). These results demonstrate that CoSANbAC/NC can simultaneously accommodate multiple LiPSs without causing steric hindrance or electronic saturation. As shown in the Gibbs free energy profile (Fig. 5b), CoSANbAC/NC exhibits the lowest reaction barrier for Li2S8-to-Li2S conversion, highlighting its superior catalytic activity. As illustrated in Fig. S19, NbAC/NC has a broad and continuous density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (E f), which is primarily derived from delocalized Nb d orbitals [39]. This electronic configuration favors electron donation and strong LiPSs adsorption. However, the absence of orbital specificity limits its ability to mediate selective S–S bond cleavage and orchestrate precise electron redistribution [21,42,47]. In contrast, CoSA/NC features more localized Co p states with favorable orbital alignment to the antibonding σ orbitals of polysulfides, enabling targeted bond activation. Nevertheless, its relatively low DOS near E f compromises the overall conductivity and electron accessibility. In CoSANbAC/NC, the incorporation of Nb and Co centers results in a notable increase in the DOS near E f (Fig. 5c), where the spatial and energetic overlap of the Nb d and Co p orbitals gives rise to a well-defined electronic coupling interface. This electronic coupling facilitates efficient charge redistribution between the two metal centers and strengthens orbital interactions with polysulfide intermediates, thereby enhancing adsorption, promoting S–S bond activation, and accelerating redox kinetics. Electrostatic potential mapping (Fig. 5d) reveals that compared with CoSA, NbAC has a relatively higher local potential, indicating strong positive polarization and enhanced electrostatic affinity toward negatively charged LiPSs. This high-potential region allows Nb sites to function as effective adsorption centers, stabilizing LiPSs through Coulombic attraction and Lewis acid-base interactions. In contrast, CoSA resides in lower-potential regions and exhibits partial electron deficiency. Although their electrostatic attraction is weaker, Co atoms offer favorable orbital alignment with the antibonding orbitals of S–S bonds in LiPSs, making them suitable for catalytic activation. The charge density difference (Fig. 5e) analysis further shows significant electron accumulation around Nb clusters and corresponding depletion near Co atoms, indicative of interfacial electronic polarization and charge redistribution. This establishes a directional electronic coupling pathway from Nb to Co, modulating the local charge environment of the adsorbed LiPSs. As a result, although LiPSs initially interact more strongly with Nb, the spatially coupled interface enables their electronic structure—particularly the frontier molecular orbitals—to increasingly engage with Co sites. This transition involves a gradual reorganization of orbital interactions across the Nb-Co interface, whereby the initially adsorbed LiPSs species increasingly engage with Co active sites, where catalytic activation preferentially occurs (Fig. 5f). In this process, the d-p orbital coupling between the Nb d and Co p orbitals near the Fermi level forms a continuous electronic bridge that facilitates orbital communication across the dual metal sites. Such electronic synergy enables effective adsorption at Nb and site-specific activation at Co, ensuring efficient polysulfide conversion through a spatially resolved and electronically coupled interface. 3 Conclusions In summary, we developed a dual-site catalytic architecture by integrating CoSA and NbAC into a nitrogen-doped graphene-like matrix via a cohesive energy-driven clustering strategy. In this architecture, Nb clusters serve as primary adsorption sites for LiPSs due to their strong polar affinity, while Co single atoms function as catalytic centers to activate S–S bonds via d-p orbital coupling. The interfacial charge redistribution and orbital hybridization promote directional electron transfer between active sites, facilitating continuous polysulfide anchoring and catalytic conversion. Furthermore, the Li2S nucleation behavior exhibits a hybrid mode that transitions from instantaneous to progressive growth, enabling high nucleation density and sustained deposition. This spatially and electronically integrated pathway enables sequential LiPSs anchoring, catalytic activation, and final desorption with enhanced efficiency. Lithium-sulfur batteries using S/CoSANbAC/NC cathodes exhibit high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and rate performance. This study provides a broadly applicable strategy for designing multifunctional catalytic interfaces, as well as fundamental insights for the rational development of next-generation energy storage systems.

        "dc:description": "Single-atom catalysts are promising for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to their high degree of atomic utilization and strong interactions with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). However, the limited number of active sites and their rapid saturation hinder the continuous adsorption and efficient conversion of LiPSs. Herein, we report a bimetallic catalyst comprising single cobalt atoms (CoSA) and niobium atomic clusters (NbAC) anchored on graphene-like nanosheets (CoSANbAC/NC), which are synthesized via a cohesive energy-driven selective metal aggregation strategy. This dual-site configuration forms an electronically asymmetric interface, where NbAC anchors LiPSs via Coulombic and Lewis acid-base interactions, while CoSA enables S–S bond polarization and cleavage through d-p orbital coupling. The interfacial charge redistribution and orbital coupling between Co and Nb facilitate electron transfer between catalytic sites. Therefore, the S/CoSANbAC/NC cathode maintains a high areal capacity of 6.12 mAh cm−2 after 60 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm−2. This work demonstrates a rational design strategy for high-performance Li-S cathodes via synergistic bimetallic catalysis.",
