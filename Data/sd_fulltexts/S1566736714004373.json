The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was accelerated on PtPb ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on titanium oxide (TiO2)/carbon black (CB) and compared with the benchmarked rate on Pt NPs/CB. Immobilization of the PtPb NPs on TiO2 was a key factor to enhance ORR activity on the PtPb NP surface. The electric interaction between the PtPb NPs and TiO2 improved the electrocatalytic activity for ORR in a 0.1M HClO4 acidic solution. Graphical abstract Keywords Oxygen reduction reaction Electrocatalyst Ordered intermetallic compound Catalyst support 1 Introduction In the research and development of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), one of the challenges is to design better alternatives to the state-of-art Pt catalyst as anode and cathode catalysts in PEFCs, for which high power density has been obtained at room temperature [1]. In particular, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in the cathode are very slow, even at the surface of the Pt catalyst. Therefore, a large overpotential is required for the ORR to proceed at any practical speed under the operating conditions of PEFCs [2]. To accelerate the ORR kinetics to reach a practical usable level in fuel cells, there has been a strong demand for the development of cathode ORR catalysts that can solve significant cost and durability issues as well as sluggish ORR kinetics. The partial [3,4] or complete [5,6] replacement of Pt metal with other metals has attracted considerable interest due to its potential to reduce the high costs of market batteries and to enhance electrocatalytic activity. Recently, we reported that PtPb/TiO2 showed substantial electrocatalytic activity for ORR [7]. The nature of the support, the composition of catalytic sites as well as their interaction with the support, and the electronic structure of catalytic sites all most likely influenced the observed electrochemical behavior. Such enhancement of PtPb NPs in the ORR activity was mainly explained as follows: (i) change in the orbital structure of Pt atoms caused by coexisting with Pb atoms, and (ii) change in Pt–Pt interatomic distance by insertion of Pb atoms into the Pt crystal structure. In addition, the enhancement of the catalytic activity, due to the presence of metal oxide support, is often called strong metal support interactions (SMSI) and significant effort has been devoted to understand this phenomenon [8–10]. SMSI has been reported also in the papers on the enhancement of ORR [11–13]. SMSI is usually explained in terms of partial charge transfer [14] or substrate-induced change in the lattice parameter of the metal deposited [15]. Particularly the change of the electronic properties of the NPs was attributed to overlapping of d orbitals (occupied) from deposited metal and the unoccupied d orbitals of the support. This PtPb NPs/TiO2 system can be expected to exhibit the synergistic effect of the inherent electrocatalytic activity of PtPb ordered intermetallic surfaces and the electronic interaction between PtPb NPs and TiO2 in the enhancement of ORR. However, in our previous study, the voltammograms obtained using a PtPb NPs/TiO2-fixed glassy carbon (GC) electrode for ORR exhibited a broad shape caused by high electron resistance (IR resistance) because the PtPb nanoparticles (NPs, particle size 3.0nm) were deposited on high resistivity TiO2 particles (particle size <25nm) and because the Pt NPs/TiO2 was fixed on a GC electrode with carbon black (CB) and Nafion. In this study, PtPb NPs were chemically deposited on small, thin TiO2 particles that were prepared on CB, to obtain ORR voltammograms that did not show IR resistance. The step-by-step deposition of Pt and Pb intentionally designed for this study achieved the restrictive fixation of PtPb NPs on the small, thin TiO2 particles. 2 Experimental Scheme 1 shows a schematic depiction of the step-by-step preparation method of PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB by annealing under inert gas atmosphere with Ti-alkoxide for TiO2, photodeposition for Pt NPs and microwave synthesis to prepare ordered intermetallic PtPb NPs on TiO2 via the reaction of Pb2+ with Pt NPs on TiO2/CB. A commercial CB (Vulcan-XC72R、E-TEK) was treated with an acidic mixture solution of H2SO4 (6M, 95.0%, Wako) and HNO3 (6M, 69.0%, Wako) at 90°C for 12h to introduce carboxylic acid functional groups on the surface and then washed with water, followed by drying overnight at 110°C. A Ti precursor solution was prepared by dissolving titanium(IV)isopropoxide (TTIP, 0.1g, Sigma-Aldrich) in iso-propanol (200mL, 99.7%, Wako). Functionalized carbon was added to the solution under vigorous stirring. De-ionized water (0.3mL) was used to accelerate the reaction of TTIP. After further stirring for 60min, the resulting mixture was collected and dried overnight at 110°C, followed by heat-treatment at 600°C for 1h under Ar atmosphere to yield CB-supported TiO2 (TiO2/CB) [16]. Pt NPs were photochemically deposited on TiO2/CB, as reported by Abe et al., to prepare Pt NPs/TiO2/CB [17]. The Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O (0.03mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 50mL of ethylene glycol (99.5%, Kanto Chemical) and then Pt NPs/TiO2/CB (0.020g) was added in the solution. The mixture was then sonicated in a bath-type ultrasonicator and treated in the flask with a reflux set for 1min under 300-W microwave radiation (focused microwave instrument, CEM) to react Pb2+ ions with Pt NPs on the TiO2/CB. The mixture in the flask was cooled to room temperature with water. The mixture was again treated under microwave radiation of 300W for 5min. After the mixture cooled, the PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB was collected via centrifugation, washed sequentially with methanol and dried under vacuum [18]. Powder X-ray diffractometry (pXRD) was performed using CuKα radiation (Rigaku RINT-UltimaIII; λ =0.1548nm) with an increment of 0.02° in a range of diffraction angles from 20 to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (JEOL, JP-9010 MC) were performed to examine the chemical states (Pt 4f) of the catalyst. MgKα was used as the X-ray source for XPS measurements with anodic voltage (10kV) and current (10mA). All XPS spectra of the samples were obtained with a take-off angle of 45° with respect to the specimens by using the pass energies of 100eV and 200eV for narrow and survey scans, respectively. A 200kV transmission electron microscope (TEM and/or STEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) equipped with two aberration correctors (CEOS GmbH) for the image- and probe-forming lens systems and an X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (JED-2300T, JEOL) for compositional analysis was used. An aliquot of 1mg PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB was suspended in a solution of 995μL of distilled water and 250μL of isopropyl alcohol. Additionally, 5μL of a 5% w/w Nafion® solution (EW: 1100, Aldrich) in alcohol was added to this suspension. The resulting suspension was sonicated for 1h. The suspension was coated onto a 5-mm-diameter GC electrode. The ORR activities of PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB, Pt NPs/TiO2/CB, PtPb NPs/CB and Pt NPs/CB were subsequently examined in O2-saturated 0.1M HClO4 using a three-electrode cell with an Ag/AgCl (3M NaCl) reference electrode and a salt bridge of NaClO4. The electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature (23±1°C), at a sweep rate of 10mVs−1 and a rotation speed of 2000rpm. The geometric area of the GC electrode was used to calculate the current density of ORR. The electrode potential measured with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was converted to the value referred to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in voltammograms. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows pXRD patterns of TiO2 (a), TiO2/CB (b), CB (c), commercially available 10wt.% Pt NPs/CB (d), synthesized Pt NPs/TiO2/CB (e), PtPb NPs/CB (f) and PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB (g). The pXRD pattern (a) was obtained using TiO2 powder (anatase, particle size <25nm, 99.7 %) purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The sample (b) prepared by annealing Ti precursor adsorbed on CB shows broad peaks that match well to the pattern observed in the TiO2 powder (a), indicating the formation of TiO2 on CB. Simulated pXRD patterns for the FCC-type Pt phase (Fm-3m, a =0.3925nm, JCPDS 04-0802) and PtPb phase (hexagonal, space group P63/mmc, a = b =0.426nm, c =0.548nm, ICDD PDF File # 06-0374) are indicated by solid bars in Fig. 1 [19]. The pXRD patterns (c) for CB show two intense peaks at 25.0° and 43.5° in 2θ, corresponding to the 002- and 101 reflections of carbon. In the pXRD patterns (d–g) of all samples prepared with CB, the two intense peaks overlap with the peaks assigned to the reflections of PtPb ordered intermetallic or Pt phases. Commercially available Pt NPs on CB show two broad peaks (d) corresponding to the 111- and 200 reflections of Pt phase. An average Pt crystal domain size of 4.6nm can be calculated from the Scherer equation. As observed from the comparison of full width at half maximum of the pXRD peaks (e), the Pt NPs formed on TiO2/CB have a larger domain size than the commercially available Pt NPs on CB. The patterns (f) and (g) of the samples prepared by reacting Pb2+ ions to Pt NPs on CB or TiO2 show peak patterns that can be indexed to the hexagonal type of PtPb ordered intermetallic structure, including the characteristic peaks for the PtPb ordered intermetallic phase, which distinguish the PtPb ordered intermetallic phase from the Pt fcc structure, which can be observed from 50 to 80° in both profiles (f) and (g). Based on the comparison of the particle sizes among the samples with full width at half maximum of the pXRD peaks, the PtPb NPs formed with photodeposited Pt/TiO2/CB and Pb2+ ions have larger crystal domain sizes than Pt NPs on TiO2/CB and CB. The particle size of Pt and PtPb deposited CB and TiO2 can be ranked as: PtPb/TiO2/CB>Pt/TiO2/CB>commercially available Pt/CB. Fig. 2 shows the XPS results in the Pt 4f region for reference Pt NPs/CB (a), PtPb NPs/CB (b) and PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB (c). The Pt 4f 7/2 peak for the PtPb NPs on CB was +0.35eV higher in binding energy compared with the corresponding peak for Pt NPs on CB, indicating that the average atomic environment around Pt atoms in the sample prepared on CB was changed by reacting the Pt atoms with Pb atoms. That is, the change can be understood with the electron donation from Pt to Pb due to the difference in electron negativity. The difference in the binding energy for the Pt 4f 7/2 peak between the PtPb NPs prepared on TiO2/CB and CB is much smaller +0.15eV than the value of observed between PtPb NPs/CB and Pt NPs. This difference is due to the interaction between PtPb NPs and TiO2, that is, Pt atoms in PtPb were also influenced by the TiO2 support as well as the Pb atoms surrounding a Pt atom in the ordered intermetallic phase of PtPb. The electronic interaction between Pt and metal oxide support, which shifts to the higher binding energies with respect to those for the Pt NPs, has been already reported by Horsley [20], Chen [21,22] and Ohsaka [23] although Pt 4f down-shift due to the interaction between Pt and metal oxide has been also reported [24–26]. They have proposed the electronic interaction between Pt and metal oxide via the bridging by O atoms which forms metalOPt bonds. Therefore, on the basis of their results, we can also propose the electronic interaction between Pt and TiO2 via the TiOPt bridging. To confirm NP distribution and that Pt NPs were certainly formed on TiO2, a STEM image and its compositional mappings (Fig. 3 ) were obtained using Pt/TiO2/CB. White spots in the STEM image correspond to Pt NPs. The NPs were heterogeneously dispersed on the surfaces. Green and red, indicating the existence of Pt and Ti atoms, respectively, always overlap in the compositional mappings obtained from the deposition of Pt NPs on the TiO2. Fig. 4 shows a high-resolution STEM image and its compositional mapping of PtPb/TiO2/CB, which was obtained to confirm the composition of Pt and Pb atoms on an ordered intermetallic NP. The atomic ratio of Pt:Pb was fairly consistent with the desired value of a PtPb ordered intermetallic phase, 61±2:39±2.0. In the mapping image, the Pb atoms could be observed only in PtPb NPs, not on CB surfaces; that is, Pb NPs were not formed on CB in the reaction with microwaves, indicating the selective reaction of Pb2+ ions with Pt NPs on the TiO2/CB surfaces, as reported by Bauer and us [18,27]. The pXRD and TEM/STEM characterization results clearly indicate that the formation of an ordered intermetallic PtPb phase can be achieved on the TiO2 fixed on CB. Fig. 5 shows linear-sweep ORR voltammograms for (a) commercially available 10wt.% Pt NPs/CB, (b) Pt NPs/TiO2/CB, (c) PtPb NPs/CB and (d) PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB in an oxygen-saturated 0.1M HClO4 solution. The element mapping in Fig. 3 indicates Pt particles deposited on both CB and TiO2 surfaces. However, it is doubtful that the activity of this catalyst originates from only PtPb/TiO2/CB. Therefore, in order to extract the origin of the ORR enhancement, the results obtained with Pt/CB, Pt/TiO2/CB, PtPb/CB and PtPb/TiO2/CB were carefully compared. Here, CB-supported Pt NPs (a) were used as a control. The ORR curve (b) obtained with Pt/TiO2/CB shifts to the positive direction, owing to the interaction between Pt NPs and TiO2 when compared with Pt/CB. The PtPb NPs also accelerate the ORR even on the CB (c). The samples of PtPb/TiO2/CB were superior in their ORR activity to all of the other samples. The particle size of PtPb ordered intermetallic NPs on TiO2 is larger than one of Pt NPs on TiO2 and CB; the Pt NPs fixed on TiO2 and CB have much larger surface areas exposed to the test solution than one of the PtPb NPs fixed on TiO2. Although the surface area of PtPb NPs is smaller than that of the reference Pt catalysts utilized in this work, the surfaces of the ordered intermetallic PtPb NPs work more efficiently for ORR. The synergistic effect of the inherent electrocatalytic activity of PtPb ordered intermetallic surfaces and the electronic interaction [28,29] between PtPb NPs and TiO2, which was taken from the XPS results, might produce superior ORR activity. It can be considered that the electronic interaction between Pt and TiO2 via the TiOPt bridging as mentioned in the XPS results contributes to the enhancement of ORR with the following two factors. (i) OH adsorbed on the Pt surface in the PtPb NPs is spilled over to the TiO2 (reduction of the formation of OH on the Pt surface) [23,30] and (ii) the d orbital electron in the Pt atoms is donated to Ti atoms through the bridging TiOPt bond (d orbital vacancy, resulting in enhanced 2π electron donation from O2 to the surface of PtPb and back donation of the electrons) [23,31], both of which facilitate the O2 adsorption on the Pt surface, that is, the first step of the ORR to produce fast and desirable two H2O molecules. 4 Conclusions In this study, the deliberate formation of PtPb on TiO2 to make the most of electric interaction between PtPb NPs and TiO2 was successfully achieved. The formation of PtPb NPs on TiO2 was confirmed with XRD, XPS, TEM and STEM, from the viewpoint of crystallinity, size, the degree of dispersion, and the electronic states of the NPs. The XPS results in the Pt 4f region for PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB and PtPb NPs/CB showed the difference in binding energy between Pt atoms in PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB and PtPb NPs/CB. Among the Pt NPs/CB, PtPb NPs/CB, Pt NPs/TiO2/CB and PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB samples, The PtPb NPs/TiO2/CB showed the highest ORR activity. The difference in the electronic state of Pt atoms in the PtPb NPs immobilized on the TiO2, which was evaluated from the XPS results, might lead to the acceleration of ORR on the surface of PtPb NPs on TiO2/CB in an acidic solution.
