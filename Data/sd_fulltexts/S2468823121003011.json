And the effect of the rotation angle between graphene and catalyst carrier on its performance was studied. The electronic properties, transition energy barrier and partial density of states of the relaxed catalysts were calculated and analyzed by first-principles method. The results show that the sandwich structure has good stability and high electron migration, while the corner structure protects the precious metal from escaping from the surface. The reaction energy barrier shows that the catalyst can complete the reaction within the energy barrier of 0.1~0.6 eV in the process of CO catalysis, and the rotation angle can move the reactant orbit faster near the Fermi level, speeding up the reaction. We propose a structural design method for a new type of single atom catalyst, and provide a reliable design basis and new design ideas for CO catalytic oxidation and green energy. Keywords Single atom catalysts Sandwich structure Amorphous Rotation angle graphene CO catalytic oxidation 1 Introduction The existence of single atoms was first discovered by Richard and others in 1959. [1] In 2011, a successful application of single atoms was Pt/FeOx single atom catalysts, which was prepared by Academician Zhang Tao research group, and put forward the concept of “single atom catalysts(SACs)” for the first time. [2] Because of its simple preparation process, high activity and selectivity, low corrosiveness and low manufacturing cost, SACs has caused a new wave of chemical catalyst design. [3–5] The Au-FeOx prepared by Jingyue Liu and others still has strong catalytic ability to catalyze the oxidation of CO at 460 ℃ for 50 h. [6] Atsushi Satsuma et al. studied the catalytic performance of Pd supported on CeO2, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 as carriers for low temperature oxidation of CO. [7] The results show that the synergism between the different carriers loaded with Pd atoms improves the efficiency of low-temperature CO conversion, and the effect is more prominent. Later reports also show that Pd atomic metal single atom catalysts are widely applied in CO oxidation at low temperature, hydrocarbon oxidation, alcohol oxidation and so on. [8,9] However, for supported metal catalysts, agglomeration and Ostwald ripening are more likely to occur with the decrease of metal particle size. [9] Professor Yuen Wu successfully prepared atomic dispersed Pd loads on ZrO2 nodes by using a new two-step carbothermal welding strategy. It is proved that different carriers have significantly different catalytic properties for single atom, which provides a reference for the design of industrial single atom catalysts. [10] Therefore, the design and preparation of stable single atom loading structure is an important topic in the direction of catalysis. Because of its excellent specific surface area and adjustable engineering structure, two-dimensional oxide materials have been widely used in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR) and pollutant degradation. [11–13] At the same time, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) can achieve excellent catalytic performance in some reaction systems. [14,15] That reductive oxide carriers can change the electron distribution of metal atoms and promote the stability of single atom was proposed by Yanggang Wang. At the same time, the activation of oxygen atoms will lead to the improvement of reactant activity, and the molecules excited by activity will be conducive to interaction. [16] ZrO2 has high thermal stability and chemical stability, and as a catalyst carrier, it also plays an active role in the oxidation of CO. [17,18] Therefore, we consider to optimize the structure of two-dimensional ZrO2 supported Pd single atom to further improve the application of the catalyst in the catalytic oxidation of CO. Heterostructure catalysts play a good role in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis by virtue of controllable electronic properties. [19,20] Compared with the conventional doping structure, core-shell structure and MOF catalysis, the heterojunction can better provide the carrier mobility on the surface of the material, and make use of the stable load of single atom. The Peng Chen team designed the 0 dimension/2 dimension(0D/2D) van der Waals heterojunction between the 0D graphene quantum dot (GQDs) and the 2D original graphene sheet. [21] Narrow band gap and efficient exciton separation lead to the decrease of Schottky barrier and the increase of photocatalytic activity. Jun Jiang et al. used graphene/h-BN sandwich structure to load a single atom on NRR, and found that the polarization electric field generated at the interface mainly realized the outstanding activity of SACs and optimized the bonding strength of the key intermediate *NNH. [22] Although they did not clearly explain the interlayer reaction. However, it also provides a solid design basis for the catalyst structure such as sandwich structure loading single atom. At the same time, if the amorphous materials are compounded with the crystal materials, it increases the reaction active sites and eliminates the negative effects caused by the lattice mismatch between the interfaces. [23] And the defect structure of amorphous materials with special topological rules endows the surface of amorphous materials with additional positive charge. It can provide additional electrostatic adsorption for electron-rich groups, and the local environment of unsaturated coordination is conducive to the adsorption of reactive substances. [24] In the selective transfer hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, the crystalline (amorphous) Al/Al2O3 core/shell nanospheres prepared by Xingliang Xu et al. have better catalytic performance than other aluminum-based materials because of the synergistic effect between the amorphous oxide layer rich in unsaturated centers and the conductive metal core. [25] It is interesting toclarify that the electronic property of single atoms of precious metals loaded on the amorphous oxides. In this paper, we want to design a new catalyst from the first principle: Graphene/two-dimensional crystal(amorphous) ZrO2 supported Pd single atom catalysts, and the catalytic reaction was designed for the catalytic oxidation of CO, a key component of air pollutants. [26,27] Meanwhile, considering that the magic angle graphene has a great influence on the energy band structure and electron transport [28], we also consider the effect of the catalyst on the reaction when the rotation angle is 0°, 0.5°, 1.1°, 1.5° and 5° Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the catalyst. From theoretical calculation angle, we try to explore the structure-activity relationship between graphene/two-dimensional oxide sandwich structure and monoatomic Pd catalyst,and the advantages of this structure in CO low temperature catalytic oxidation are compared and analyzed. 2 Computational method In this paper, the first-principles method based on polarized density functional theory ((DFT)) is adopted. The exchange correlation energy is calculated by using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The oxide amorphous model is formed by rapid cooling under the canonical ensemble. The cooling temperature is reduced from 3100 K to 300 K and the total step size is 5 ps, and 1 fs per step. The ZrO2 is cut in (111) section, and the mismatch is less than 3% with graphene. Considering the strong Coulomb exchange interactions between electrons at the transition metal d energy level. Electronic structure analysis through the OTFG ultra-soft pseudopotential calculation of the CASTEP module, the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) dispersion correction van der Waals force is selected. The reaction calculation is carried out through the Dmol3 module, and the double numerical plus polarized (DNP) basis set is selected. For the transition state (TS) search, the linear synchronous transmission (LST) maximum calculation is performed, and the repeated conjugate gradient method is optimized and the secondary synchronous transmission (QST) maximization method is used for subsequent processing until an accurate transition state is found. At the same time, the search for TS is verified by frequency calculation, and there is only one virtual frequency per TS. The precision of the truncation radius is set to the value of Fine, truncation energy 570 eV. The K-point grid in Brillouin zone is 4 × 4 × 1. In order to avoid the interference of periodic arrangement and eliminate the interaction force of atoms between layers, the thickness of vacuum layer in the sandwich structure is selected as 18 Å. In this work, the optimization of geometric structure is stopped when the force and energy standards reach 0.1 eV/Å and 10−5 eV, respectively, and the maximum stress is 0.002 Ha−1 and the maximum displacement is 0.01 Ha−1. At this time, the total energy of the system is also the lowest, which ensures that model fits well with experiment results (Fig. 2 ). Here, eight models of crystal Pd@ZrO2, Pd@0° graphene/crystal ZrO2, Pd@amorphous ZrO2, Pd@0° graphene/amorphous ZrO2, Pd@0.5° graphene/amorphous ZrO2, Pd@1.1° graphene/amorphous ZrO2, Pd@1.5° graphene/amorphous ZrO2 and Pd@5° graphene/amorphous ZrO2 are designed and marked sequentially as model 1 to model 8. The lattice parameters of the monomer structure of ZrO2 and graphene are consistent with those reported in the literature. [29,21] After structure optimization, the stability of the catalyst and the efficiency and stability of catalytic oxidation in CO are calculated and analyzed respectively. 3 Computational structural analysis 3.1 Catalysts properties First of all, We tested the stability of the crystal structure and the ZrO2(111) surface of the amorphous structure, under the NVT ensemble, the total step size is 5 Ps, a total of 2500 steps, as shown in Fig. 3 , the energy fluctuation state is about 0.001 Ha, which indicates that the two-dimensional ZrO2(111) structure is stable. Then, we calculate the formation energy (Ef ) of the sandwich structure, as shown in Table 1 , the Ef is negative, indicating that the structure is stable, in which the binding of model 8 is the most stable, and the electron-hole recombination rate is limited. Next, we look for the best adsorption site of Pd atoms in the above eight models, and calculate the adsorption energy (Ea ) of Pd atoms in the best active site. The adsorption energy is defined as follows: Δ E a = E T o t a l − E M − E P d ETotal is the energy of the whole system, EM the energy of the original system, EPd the energy of the Pd atom. At the same time, the distance between the nearest O atom of Pd and the Zr atom is measured, and the results are shown in Table 1. From the results of Ea , it can be seen that all the models are stably adsorbed on the surface of amorphous ZrO2 from the point of view of thermodynamics, and they are all chemisorption. The adsorption energy of the single atom catalysts formed by 0° graphene and amorphous ZrO2 is −5.741 eV, and the binding effect is the best. Comparing model 1 with model 2 and model 3 with model 4, it is found that the adsorption stability of single atom catalysts supported on sandwich structure is stronger than that of monolayer two-dimensional materials. The adsorption of monolayer amorphous zirconia is weak. the possible reason is that the energy of the two-dimensional amorphous surface is too high and no stable energy structure is formed after the adsorption of single atoms. According to the bond length, the Pd atoms in different models are close to the O atoms of amorphous materials and are adjacent to each other. This also confirms that O has large electronegativity and strong bonding ability. Through further analysis of the magic angle structure, it is found that the adsorption sites of the sandwich materials will migrate slightly during the torsion process, which is smaller than the adsorption bond length of crystal or amorphous ZrO2. Pd@1.1 adsorption energy is small in the graphene/amorphous ZrO2 model, but the bond length is also very small. It should be explained that there is no clear relationship between the size of the adsorption energy and the length of the formed chemical bond. Also related to other factors such as electronic states in the environment. After that, the Mulliken charge and energy band structure of the catalyst model are calculated, and the carrier effective mass is calculated numerically by conduction band(CB) and valence band(VB). Table 1 shows the amount of charge and the effective mass of the band gap near the Pd atom. Mulliken charge can say that the electrons in the valence electron layer are transferred. According to the data, Pd and Zr are easy to lose electrons. The larger the value is, the stronger the covalent bond ability is, and the O atom is easy to get electrons to bond with cations. Therefore, both PdO and ZrO have covalent bond structure. Further analysis of the Mulliken bond order of OPd and OZr bonds can also confirm the above statement. Small carrier effective mass can promote the diffusion of photogenerated electrons and holes, improve the migration ability and reduce the recombination probability between them, which is very beneficial to the catalytic reaction. Compared with the monolayer material loads of model 1 and model 3, other models show good carrier migration and diffusion effects, indicating that the sandwich structure of single atom catalysts can effectively reduce the recombination phenomenon of charged particles. Monolayer structure, especially amorphous, is difficult to exist stably without support. In order to further understand the electronic structure of the system, we analyze the density of states. As shown in Fig. 4 , the sandwich structure model has the characteristics of metal properties. The comprehensive comparison of Fig. 4a~d shows that Pd-4d orbitals play a major role in electron transport and catalysis. In the crystal structure, Zr-4d also effectively increases the carrier mobility at the interface. The addition of graphene significantly improves the degree of orbital hybridization, and the O atomic orbital of the carrier ZrO2 has almost no contribution near the Fermi level, indicating that it is nearly stable after bonding with Pd. A relatively wide peak appears at the depth of the valence band (−3~−9.7 eV) and far away from the conduction band (3.5~8.2 eV), corresponding to the degree of localization of the energy level curve in the above two ranges, and the energy level degeneracy occurs. In the tight-binding model, model 3 has an energy gap at the front of the valence band, indicating that the amorphous material itself has strong electron delocalization characteristics, which will form a strong electron layer at the interface. In the 0° graphene/amorphous ZrO2 supported Pd single atom catalyst (model 4), the contribution of the 4d orbital of Pd is the most prominent, and the degree of localized state is high, which will improve the coordination binding ability with the reaction molecules. Therefore, graphene as a carrier has an important influence on the stability, adsorption configuration, electron transfer mechanism and adsorption energy of single atom catalysts. Fig. 4e-h shows the density of states of the catalyst model with rotation angle. At this time, the C-2p and Zr-4d orbitals make a great contribution at the Fermi interface, and the 5 s orbitals of Pd in model 5-model 6 also participate in the transmission of electrons at the interface. It shows that the influence of the rotation angle of the two-dimensional sandwich structure on the electronic state is obvious. The Pd-4d orbitals are basically located near the valence band, indicating that the sandwich catalyst combines better at this time, and the reaction will be stably attached to the carrier in the subsequent reaction simulation, which can effectively catalyze the reaction. 3.2 CO catalytic oxidation analysis The model is used to calculate the reaction of CO catalytic oxidation. Firstly, the adsorption energy of the model is calculated to determine whether the catalyst is easy to bind CO or O2 molecules. Under the same model in Table 2 , the adsorption degree of the two molecules is obvious. The adsorption capacity of the catalyst model for O is greater than that for CO. In Table 2, the adsorption degree of the two molecules is obvious under the same model. Both molecules and the catalyst indicate that effective chemisorption has been formed, indicating that the reaction gas has electron interaction with the carrier catalysts. In addition, the adsorption energy of the product CO2 is small, all within −0.8 eV, indicating that there is no chemical interaction between CO2 and SACs, and it has a good desorption ability. It's similar to what Yanan Tang team does [30]. The adsorption of the catalyst model for O is greater than the adsorption capacity for CO. It is also seen from the bond length that Pd has strong binding force for O2 molecules, leading in shorter bond length. The results show that O2 reaction is first opened under the synergistic action of Pd atoms and sandwich structure carriers. Therefore, we can infer that the mechanism of this model for CO catalytic oxidation should be Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism [31,32]. We set the reaction as: C(1)O(2)+O(2)-O(3)→*OCO+O*, *OCO→CO2, O*+C(2)O(4)→CO2. The initial state (IS), transition state (TS), middle state (MS) and final state (FS) are set as different reaction states. Fig. 5 shows the reaction energy barrier of 8 models. Table 3 shows the surface energy of the model before and after reaction and the Mulliken charge of Pd atom. The calculation formula of surface energy is as follows: E s u r f a c e = [ E s l a b − ( N s l a b / N b u l k ) E b u l k ] / 2 A The Esurface is the surface energy, the Eslab is the relaxation energy, the Nslab is the number of crystal plane atoms, the Nbulk is the number of in-cell atoms in the bulk phase, and the Nbulk is to optimize the cell energy of the posterior phase, and A the area of the crystal plane. By analyzing the change of the surface energy of each model before and after the reaction, we can find that the energy difference of each model is less than 0.3 eV/m2, which is less than one order of magnitude, indicating that the catalyst can exist stably in the catalytic oxidation of CO. Relatively speaking, the crystal monolayer is unstable, indicating that the two-dimensional crystal monolayer structure is not very ideal, and the effects of model 4 and model 8 are better. Fig. 5 shows the transition state energy barrier of the L-H mechanism in the catalytic oxidation of CO by eight models. In the original model, we define the IS state as the chemisorption state when the adsorption energy exceeds 0.5 eV. According to the adsorption energy, we can see that CO2 and O2 are chemisorbed with Pd at the same time (TS1), and first form *OCOO intermediate ligand (MS1). At this time, the Omure O bond length is followed by active O* separation, and CO2 molecules are successfully formed (MS2). This process only has configuration regulation, without considering the existence of transition state. Finally, the active O* and CO continue to combine through the transition state TS2 with smaller imaginary frequency to form the second CO2 molecule (FS). In Fig. 5, we can see that in the first step of energy barrier search, the formation of *OOCO intermediate ligands needs to cross the energy barrier. The energy barrier values vary from 0.075 eV to 1.085 eV. Models 1, 2, 4 and 6 have relatively large energy barrier values, so it is not easy to occur. Then, in the process of OCO configuration adjustment of CO2, except for the monolayer crystal ZrO2 (Model 1) and graphene/crystal ZrO2 (model 2), whose energies are 0.357 eV and 0.286 eV, the rest of the models are around 0.1 eV, which shows that amorphous materials have good relaxation and flexible materials such as graphene have higher advantages for reaction configuration regulation. Then the O* is combined with the new CO, and the optimized energy is in the range of −1.047 ~−2.120 eV, which is stable. In the TS2 process, it is obvious that only Model 2 can cross the energy barrier of 1.762 eV to form the final CO2, which is very difficult. Although the model has a good mobility, a small formation energy may hinder the reaction. Although the model has a better carrier mobility, the structural changes caused by smaller formation energy may hinder the reaction. Some of the other models react across the energy barrier of less than 0.2 eV, and some transition to FS state spontaneously, which is affected by the local coordination environment and charge distribution. On the whole, they all have a positive effect on the response. And the degree of reaction is more conducive to the occurrence of reaction than the design system of Xiaofeng Yang et al. [33]. Their Pd/FeOx requires energy across the 0.6 eV, which has exceeded the 1 eV when the M = Cu, Au, Ag. At the same time, the data of FS in Fig. 4 show that the existence of the corner makes the final state of the reaction reach a lower energy, so the single atom catalyst structure we designed can be effectively applied to the catalytic oxidation of CO. According to the reaction energy barrier, we can know that the sandwich structure has an obvious promoting effect on limited domain catalysis, and the effect is considerable when the amorphous structure with topological properties is combined with carbon-based two-dimensional materials. It can also be observed from the above data that the rotation angle also has an effect on the reaction. In the density of partial wave states, Pd-4d moves to the valence band under the action of the rotation angle, which effectively protects the migration of Pd atom during the affect with the reactants. We take model 4 and model 8 (Pd@0° graphene/ amorphous ZrO2 and Pd@5° graphene/ amorphous ZrO2) as examples to analyze the spin density of states, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 , to explore the significance of rotation angle in catalysis. On the whole, in TS1, the Pd-4d orbital moves to the Fermi level and widens, and the reactive oxygen species in O2 also move to the Fermi level, which crosses together, and the peak value near the Fermi level also changes obviously. This change is caused by the elongation of PdO, the breaking of OO bond and the formation of OC bond. The formation of the sandwich structure effectively suppresses the passivation of the active center of Pd, and the catalyst has higher catalytic activity and stability by increasing the adsorption energy. In the MS1(Figs. 6(c), 7(c)), there is a hybrid between Pd-4d and O(3)*−2p orbitals, and there are stable PdO bonds and OCO. And then MS2, Pd-4d state becomes sharp and moves near the Fermi level, there are significant hybrids between O*−2p and Pd-4d orbitals. Then, at MS2, the Pd-4d state becomes sharp and shifts near the Fermi level, indicating that there is a significant hybridization between the O-2p orbital and the Pd-4d orbital. In other words, there is an obvious orbital interaction between Pd and O* atoms, indicating the formation of chemical bonds between O* atoms and Pd atoms. When passing through the transition state TS2, the Pd-4d orbitals are smooth again, and the electron distribution is more uniform. The cleavage of the Pd-O* bond makes the active O form a favorable covalent bond with the newly added CO, resulting in the formation of CO2. The difference is that with the addition of rotation angle, the C atomic orbital moves to the depth of the valence band, and the activity of O atom interaction is enhanced. in the two transition states, the atomic orbitals overlap greatly, indicating that the hybrid binding between atoms is enhanced. And in Figs. 6(e) and 7(e), it is found that different from the O source of Pd-4d orbital hybridization, the O of model 4 comes from reactive oxygen species decomposed in oxygen. However, the O in model 8 comes from O in CO, and the degree of the newly introduced C-2p orbitals participating in orbital hybridization at Fermi level is significantly higher than that in model 4. The possible reason for this result is that the binding between O* and Pd is weak, and the population of Pd is 0.676 e, so more energy is needed to make it overlap with CO orbitals. It is clear from the energy barrier diagram that the energy required is within the actual allowable range. It can be analyzed that the sandwich structure supported single atom catalysts with appropriate rotation angle is often more beneficial to the related reactions. The development and design of transition metal single atomic catalysts with high stability and high reaction activity is an urgent but challenging task at the same time. Therefore, our innovative design of crystal (amorphous) two-dimensional ZrO2/graphene sandwich structure supported Pd noble metal single atom catalyst has good catalytic performance in CO oxidation. Compared with the core-shell structure, the doping system loaded with Pd single atom has better catalytic activity and more flexible design [8,29]. When calculating the electronic properties, the sandwich structure has a higher carrier mobility than the monolayer structure, and the quantum effect of the monolayer structure makes it difficult to stabilize. Sandwich structure can significantly improve the stability of two-dimensional oxides and better synergistic catalysis with single atoms. The formation energy shows that the structural stability is very high, all within the range of −0.6 eV ~ −3.3 eV. At the same time, the adsorption activity of single atom is higher, and the maximum adsorption energy is −5.741 eV, which makes full use of the advantage of sandwich structure in limited domain catalysis. In the process of reaction simulation, the energy barrier values of most models are about 0.6 eV, and the final state energies are all below −4.943 eV, indicating that low temperature CO catalytic oxidation can be realized completely. Except for the great change of surface energy of model 1 and model 2, it is not conducive to the occurrence of reaction cycle. Before and after the reaction of other models, the surface energy of the adsorption and dissociation process of reactants and products changed about 0.3 eV/m2, which did not exceed the order of magnitude, which proved that the catalyst was stable from another point of view. The appearance of the corner also provides more protection for the Pd single atom, the 5d orbital migrates to the valence band, the adsorption is better, the binding with the carrier is closer, and the occurrence of clusters is reduced. Therefore, the long-term, stable and efficient existence of the structural catalyst provides a favorable guarantee for the single atom stable active site. By analyzing the reaction energy barrier and spin state density of the corner interlayer catalyst, the unique electronic structure is beneficial to the start of the reaction. At the same time, the electron distribution environment is also affected, which can activate CO molecules, weaken the chemical bonds of reactants, and speed up the progress of the reaction. It can be said that it cannot only ensure the stability of the catalyst, but also effectively improve the catalytic ability. It also shows that graphene not only plays a supporting and stable role in the system, but also plays a positive role in the catalytic effect, such as the adsorption of single atom, the transformation of reaction configuration, the process of reaction and so on. 4 Conclusion In this paper, the crystal (amorphous) ZrO2/graphene sandwich structure supported transition noble metal Pd single atom catalysts was designed creatively, and the interlayer oxidation of CO was studied. In the theoretical calculation, we find that the SACs with this structure has a high carrier mobility. At the same time, the formation energy, the adsorption energy of Pd and the surface energy of IS and FS fully confirm that the sandwich structure can exist stably, and the single atom has effective chemical adsorption on this structure. Graphene rotation will also better protect the surface of ZrO2 adsorbed by Pd single atom. It further affects the environment of electron distribution, activates the dissociation of CO molecules, and speeds up the progress of the reaction. Therefore, the sandwich structure combines the advantages of the two materials and plays an important role in the stability, adsorption configuration, electron transfer mechanism, adsorption energy and potential barrier of single atom catalysts. This study creatively designed a single atom catalyst structure, which provides a new design idea for the efficient catalysis of transition metal single atom catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Based on the first-principles method of density functional theory (DFT), a two-dimensional graphene/amorphous ZrO2 composite carrier supported precious metal Pd single atom catalyst was designed, and the catalytic efficiency and catalytic stability of CO to CO2 in limited domain were discussed. And the effect of the rotation angle between graphene and catalyst carrier on its performance was studied. The electronic properties, transition energy barrier and partial density of states of the relaxed catalysts were calculated and analyzed by first-principles method. The results show that the sandwich structure has good stability and high electron migration, while the corner structure protects the precious metal from escaping from the surface. The reaction energy barrier shows that the catalyst can complete the reaction within the energy barrier of 0.1~0.6 eV in the process of CO catalysis, and the rotation angle can move the reactant orbit faster near the Fermi level, speeding up the reaction. We propose a structural design method for a new type of single atom catalyst, and provide a reliable design basis and new design ideas for CO catalytic oxidation and green energy.",
