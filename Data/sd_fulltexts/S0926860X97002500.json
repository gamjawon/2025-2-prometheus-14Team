Oligomerization of ethene and its copolymerization with the monomers produced during the process occur simultaneously. Homogeneous or supported compounds of titanium (or vanadium) [1-8] or chromium [9-13] are used as polymerizing agents, whereas Ti(OR)4 [1-3], (C3H5)3Cr [4], (CHCOO)ZNi [6], chelates of nickel, cobalt and iron [7] and ilide complexes of nickel [8] are used as oligomerizing agents (Table 1). It has been shown recently that bicenter catalysts show stereoregulating effect in polymerization of propene and 4methyl-l-pentene [ 14].

This paper reports new approaches to the synthesis of bicenter metal-complex catalytic systems deposited on dehydrated microspheric silica gel. The method for preparing the catalysts of this type includes the sequential precipitation of a titanium- or chromiumcontaining compound and oligodienyl metal-aluminum complexes (metal - nickel or zirconium) on the surface of dehydrated microspheric silica gel as the first and the second component, respectively. The paper describes the use of these catalysts in olefin and diene polymerization and some data on the effect of catalyst composition and conditions of polymerization on the structure and properties of the resulting polymers (polyethylene and polybutadiene), the data on polymerization of dienes on these catalysts being presented for the first time. 2. Experimental Monomers (ethene and butadiene) and solvents (pentane, isopentane, heptane, benzene, and toluene) were purified according to techniques conventional to the synthesis of co-ordination systems. Oligodienyl metal-aluminum complexes (metal nickel or zirconium), titanium-magnesium catalysts and bicenter catalysts were synthesized in an atmosphere of pure argon. Bicenter (binuclear) catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation of titanium-magnesium or chromiumcontaining compounds and oligodienyl metalaluminum complexes on dehydrated microspheric silica gel. Titanium-magnesium catalyst supported on silica gel was prepared by mixing dehydrated microspheric silica gel with a titanium-magnesium catalyst (TMC) in pentane [16]. In turn, TMC was prepared by reacting TiCL4 with anhydrous MgC12 which was prepared by decomposition of butylmagnesium chloride with excess butyl chloride according to [17]. As a chromium-containing catalyst triphenylsilylchromate Q(C6H5)3S'O12Cr02/Si02), supported on silica gel and treated with diethylaluminum ethoxide AI(OC2HS)(C2HS)Z was used. The second component of bicenter catalyst-oligodienyl nicklealuminum (or zirconiumaluminum) complexes were prepared by reacting chloride of corresponding metal with triisobutylaluminum in the presence of diene (butadiene, isoprene, allene) in aromatic (benzene, toluene) or aliphatic (pentane, isopentane, heptane) hydrocarbon at 30-40 at a molar ratio of components as follows: metal/aluminum/diene = 1/3/6 [18]. Polymerization of ethene was mainly performed in the gaseous phase using two reactors. The first reactor was 1.5 1 autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The second reactor was 0.51 flow-type apparatus. Both reactors were equipped with a thermostat and E. Mushina et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 153-161 a special unit for opening the ampules with a catalyst without contact with air. Pressure in the reactors was maintained constant by means of a contact manometer connected with a solenoid valve. Before the beginning of the experiment, the reactors were purged with pure ethene at 90 for 2 h and the polymerization carried out for 15-20 min at a pressure of ethene of 0.20.5 MPa at 60-70. After prepolymerization was complete, the pressure of ethene was raised to 1.52.0 MPa and, then, polymerization was conducted at this pressure for 1 h. The microstructure of polyethylene prepared with bicenter catalysts was determined by IR spectroscopic analysis with a Bruker IFS-133V instrument using the films of polyethylene with thicknesses of ca. 1030 pm. Molecular mass characteristics of polyethylene were determined with a Waters gel-chromatograph using columns packed with a macroporous glass and a Devison silica gel. o-Dichlorobenzene was used as eluent. The rate of elution was 1 ml/min. Physico-mechanical properties of polyethylene were studied using a TIRA-2200 tensile-testing machine at room temperature with a strain rate of 20 mm/min. The films used for physico-mechanical studies were prepared by pressing PE powder at 140 at a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The films were kept at this pressure for 10 min, cooled in a water-ice mixture and the bands of 2 mm-width were cut. In the experiments, when tensile strength of the films was determined, the working length of the film was 20 mm. The ends of the bands, which were fixed in the clamps of the tensiletesting machine, were strengthened by stretching on iron at a temperature ca. 100. The density of polyethylene was determined by the flotation method. Polymerization of butadiene was conducted in glass ampules or dilatometers. After polymerization was complete, the polymer was precipitated from a solution with methanol containing an antioxidant (ionol) and dried under vacuum. Thermodynamic characteristics of polybutadiene were studied by the differential scanning calorimeter using a Mettler TA 4000 calorimeter. The sample of polybutadiene was heated from -60 to +200 at a rate of 10 K/min. The microstructure of polydienes was determined by IR spectroscopy using a Specord M 82 instrument. 155 Composition and structure of oligodineyl metalaluminum complexes were studied by IR spectroscopic analysis of heptane solutions and from the data of chromatographic and mass spectral analyses of the decomposition products of these compounds. Analyses were performed with a chromatograph equipped with a glass capillary columns, using SE-30 as a stationary phase, and an LKB-2091 mass spectrometer (capillary column 80 m/0.25 mm, Apieson L as a stationary phase, 70 eV) in the 60-120 range. Components of the catalyst were analyzed for the content of metals (Ti, Ni, Zr, AI). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Bicenter metal-complex catalysts As already mentioned, the oligodienyl complexes were obtained by the exchange reaction between chloride of transition metal and (i-C4H9)3A1 in the presence of diene: MCIm + (i-CQHy)3A1 ~ (i-C4H9) MCIm_, + (i-C4H9)ZAICI i-C4H$ + HMCI,_1 n(CH) H(C5He)nMClrr,-1 where: M = Ni or Zr; m = 2 or 4; n = 2-7. ~n(C3H4) 1I(CaHa)CIi According to the scheme the decomposition of (i-C4H9) MCIm_ 1 takes place and the elimination of i-C4Hs was confirmed chromatographically. The structure and composition of the complexes obtained were studied by chromato-mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. To determine the composition of oligomers of isoprene, oligodienyl complex of zirconium was decomposed with hydrochloric acid and the reaction products were analyzed gas chromatographically and mass spectrometrically. In the decomposition products, only the hydrocarbons of type [(CSHs)n + 2H] (n = 2 = 7) were found. The absence in these of butyl radicals allows the suggestion to be made that the insertion of the first molecule of the dime takes place at the M-H but not M-C bond. The data of analysis of decomposition products are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, composition 156 E.

An increase in the Al/Zr molar ratio leads to an increase in the amount of dimers. In addition, these data show that oligomerization of isoprene is accompanied by predominant formation of di-, tri, and tetramers. In the IR spectrum of oligodienyl zirconium-aluminum complex (Fig. 1), the band at 530 cm-' corresponding to the Zr-CL bond in ZrCL4 decreases in intensity and shifts to 545 cm-'. At the same time, the new bands emerge at 495 and 435 cm-'. The emergence of these two bands can be attributed to the forming of Zr-C bonds. 7r-Alkenyl structure is characterised by the bands at 545, 1015, 1280, and 15001570 cm-', all these bands disappearing upon contact of the complex with air. It was also shown that the oligodienyl compounds form complexes with (i- C4H9)zA1Cl, which contain bridge structure (Zr-CL bond, 300 cm-'): H(CsHx),_i - CHz - CH i CI CI v CH3-C',--Zr/ CI\\CI/ CHz AIU-CaH9)z The resulting oligoalkylidene (when allene is used) or oligodienyl (in the case of isoprene or butadiene) ligands stabilize metal-organoaluminum complexes due to formation of 7r-complexes between the metal and oligodienyl ligands [19]. In the case of titanium-magnesium supported catalyst, reaction of oligodienyl metal-aluminum complexes can proceed either with free hydroxyl groups of silica gel or with titanium-magnesium component anchored on silica gel (hypothetical scheme in Fig. 2).

Polymerization of ethene using bicenter metal-complex catalysts The prepared catalytic systems were used to produce medium density polyethylene by gas-phase polymerization of ethene without addition of comonomers. It turned out that the oligomers of ethene (1-butene, 1-hexene, etc.) formed in situ under the action of oligodienyl complexes co-polymerize with ethene in the presence of titanium-magnesium or chromium-containing component. Bifunctionality of these catalytic systems was confirmed by chromatographic analysis of the reaction gas and by the data on microstructure of the resulting polyethylene. In the study of bicenter chromium-containing catalysts, polymerization of ethene was performed at 90 using a laboratory flow-type setup. In these experiments, concentration of hydrogen was in the 2.5-4.0 vol% range. Several series of the catalysts, which differ in the content of the modifying agent (molar ratio Ni/Cr and Zr/Cr varying in the 0.2-1.0 and 0.2-1.5 ranges, respectively), were synthesized and studied. The data of Table 3 show that when the Ni/Cr ratio grows the melt index increases and activity of the catalyst concurrently drops. At the same time, elasticity of the polymer estimated as relative elongation at break remains unchanged at the level of 600-800%. Catalytic systems containing zirconium compound were more active under the same conditions (Table 3). The increased activity was observed in a wide range of Zr/Cr ratio, from 0.6 to 1.5. The melt index changes in the 0.3-0.9 range as the Zr/Cr ratio changes from 0.8 to 1.5. The samples of polyethylene prepared using chromium-containing catalyst modified by organozirconium compound show enhanced elasticity. According to the IR spectra, the tendency to increase in the degree of branching of macromolecules appears as the Ni/Cr or Zr/Cr ratio grows (Table 4).

Fig. 3 shows the kinetic curves of the ethene polymerization with supported titanium-magnesium catalysts and with the same catalysts modified by oligodienyl nickel and zirconium compounds. As is seen, titanium-magnesium catalysts modified by organozirconium compounds are the most active. Modification of the starting catalyst can raise the initial rate of polymerization almost by three times. Like chromium-containing catalysts, these systems are bifunctional catalysts, which cause oligomerization of ethene (derivatives of nickel or zirconium) and its copolymerization with the forming oligomers (titanium compounds). Table 5 presents the data on physico-chemical properties of PE prepared with titanium-magnesium catalysts of various compositions and on the activity of these systems. As is seen, the use of modified titanium-magnesium catalyst allows preparation of PE showing reasonable strength and relative elongation. These data indicate also that the modified titanium-magnesium catalysts are markedly more active in polymerization of ethene to the chromium-containing catalyst (see Table 3), with titanium-magnesium catalysts modified by organozirconium compounds showing the highest activity. Table 6 presents the data on the structure of polyethylene prepared with these catalysts. These data show that as the molar ratio of oligomerizing and polymerizing components of the catalyst increases the degree of branching grows. At the same time, the PE density decreases and varies in the 0.940-0.945 g/cm3 range.

In this case, number average molecular mass does not exceed 20 000 and the nature of the modifying metal almost does not effect molecular mass characteristics. In the case of titanium-magnesium catalysts, the resulting PE is characterised by a narrow molecular mass distribution (MlM,, = 4-7), the nature of oligomerizing component of the catalyst markedly affecting molecular mass of the polymer. This effect is especially distinct at low concentrations of hydrogen in the reaction gas, when the transition from organonickel to organozirconium compound is accompanied by an increase in the number average molecular mass by ca. 2.5 times. 3.3. Diene polymerization with bicenter metalcomplex catalysts It has been shown recently that the silica-gel supported titanium-magnesium catalyst in combination with triisobutylaluminum is an effective catalyst for traps-polymerization of butadiene at a molar ratio Al/Ti = 10-20 [20]. The resulting polymer contains 98 wt% of traps-units and is a crystalline material. Polymerization of isoprene also produces traps-polymer. The rate of polymerization of butadiene increases as a Al/Ti ratio grows from 5 to 20. Further increase in this ratio does not affect the rate of the process. However, an increase in the Al/Ti molar ratio is accompanied by an increase in the content of cis-units in the polymer. As an extension of these researches, we studied polymerization of dienes, mainly butadiene, using bicenter catalysts of two types - Ti/Mg/Si02 and a chromium catalyst modified by oligodienyl organoaluminum compounds of zirconium and nickel. Tables 8 and 9 show the data on microstructure of the prepared polymers. Among the studied modifying additives nickel-containing complex shows the highest effect on the structure and kinetics of polymerization. The polymers, prepared with chromiumcontaining catalyst at 20, contain more than 80 wt% of 1,4-cis-units. The effect of zirconiumcontaining component on the microstructure of polybutadiene is markedly smaller than that of nickelcontaining component. The content of the fractions of the polymer soluble and insoluble in boiling hexane were determined by Table 8 Structure of polybutadiene with chromium-containing catalyst modified by oligodienyl zirconium and nickel compounds (according to IR-spectroscopy). Concentration of butadiene 2 mol/1 Metal ratio (mol/mol) Zr/Cr = 1.0 Zr/Cr = 1.0 Ni/Cr = 0.3 Ni/Cr = 0.3 Temperature/ Content of units/ wt% cis- 1,4 traps-1,4 1.2- 20 60 20 60 43 26 88 12 54 71 6 83 3 3 6 5 Table 9 Structure of polybutadiene with titanium-magnesium catalyst and with the same catalyst modified by oligodienyl zirconium and nickel compounds (according to IR-spectroscopy).

It was found that the fraction of the polymer soluble in hot hexane contains only cis- 1,4-units, whereas the insoluble fraction contains traps-1.4-units. These results and the data of DSC [20] allow us to conclude that the polymers prepared using bicenter catalysts are the mixture of cis- and traps-polymers formed by different active centers. It was shown by X-ray diffraction analysis [21] that supermolecular structure of partially crystalline trans1,4-polybutadiene is unconventional. In addition to amorphous and crystalline phase components, which are conventional for the flexible-chain polymer, the prepared polymer contains also a considerable amount (up to 30 wt%) of mesomorphous phase, which was found to belong to a rare low-temperature condismesomorphic state [22]. Thus, the use of bicenter catalysts makes it possible to prepare homogeneous mixtures of cis- and transpolymers, which are of indubitable interest for practical application. E. Mushina et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 166 (1998) 153-161 4. Conclusions 1. Zirconium- and nickel-organoaluminum compounds bearing oligodienyl ligands were synthesized and their structure and composition were studied. It was shown that (i-C4H9)2AICI forms with these oligodienyl compounds complexes, which contain bridge structures with metalchloride bonds. 2. Medium-density (0.940-0.945 g/cm3) PE was prepared by gas-phase polymerization of ethene using bicenter supported catalysts. It is found that titanium-magnesium catalysts modified by zirconium-organialuminum compounds are the most active in ethene polymerization. 3. Bicenter metal complex catalysts are highly effective in diene polymerization. Microstructure of the resulting polymer is determined by composition of the catalyst and polymerization temperature. The prepared polymers represent mixtures of cis- and trans-units.

New bicenter metal-complex catalysts supported on dehydrated microspheric silica gel have been synthesized and tested in the polymerization of ethene and butadiene. The catalysts contain two components: a titanium-magnesium- or chromium-containing compound and an oligodienyl metal-aluminium complexes with a bridge structure (metal-Zr or Ni). A possibility of preparation of linear medium-density polyethylene by polymerization of ethene in gas-phase process without using comonomers was established. These catalysts also display high efficiency in the polymerization of butadiene, the products obtained being the mixtures of cis- and trans-polymers. It was found that titanium-magnesium catalysts modified by zirconium-organoaluminum compounds are most active in both ethene and butadiene polymerization processes.
