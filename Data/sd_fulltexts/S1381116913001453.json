Graphical abstract The adsorption kinetics of hydrogen on solid support is accelerated by three orders of magnitude upon adding carbon nanotubes (CNT) to the support. The gas–solid catalytic hydrogenation is studied at ambient temperature and sub atmospheric pressure while the support consists of a mixture of nano Pd-on-carbon with unsaturated hydrocarbon H-acceptor. The addition of a small amount of pristine CNT minimizes the required Pd concentration. A similar effect is demonstrated by addition of different oxides to the composite, but at much higher additive concentrations. The addition of the spillover agent improves the transport of the hydrogen atoms in the composite to remote sites with low Pd concentration via a spillover mechanism. Therefore, it is possible to overcome the decelerating effect of inhomogeneity in the support. The irreversible gas–solid hydrogenation could serve as a simplified platform to study the slower step of hydrogen spillover, which operates also in hydrogen storage processes. Keywords Hydrogenation Spillover Carbon nanotubes Solid-state Solvent-free Hydrogen storage Catalysis Phenyl acetylene 1 Introduction Solid phase catalyzed hydrogenation of phenyl acetylenes under low hydrogen pressure and ambient temperature is a fast, irreversible and quantitative reaction, which could reach high yields (>99%) of the hydrogenated product [1,2]. The reaction has useful applications in avoiding possible explosion or chemical damages by scavenging hydrogen in closed enclosures such as cell-phone batteries, optical fiber cables or radioactive waste containers [3–5]. Catalytic solid–gas hydrogenation mechanism involves hydrogen activation on a metallic surface, followed by atomic hydrogen spillover (SO), a term describing a transport (e.g., via surface diffusion) of activated hydrogen from one solid surface to another. Recently, hydrogen SO has been pointed out as a vital step in hydrogen storage processes [6–10] and in the chemistry of fuel cells electrocatalysts [11]. The well known SO phenomenon in liquid phase heterogeneous catalysis has been extensively studied during the last four decades with carbon and oxide promoters, and found to be rather complex [12,13]. The solvent-free, solid–gas hydrogenation is, however, a simpler system, which makes it an ideal platform for the study of dissociated hydrogen direct interactions with the solid surfaces. A primary hydrogen SO involves transport of activated hydrogen from the metallic catalyst to the catalyst support, while a secondary SO relates to hydrogen transport to a third solid, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [14] or zeolites [15], which “bridges” between the catalyst support and final H-acceptor [16]. The study of secondary SO effect on hydrogen storage has been performed by comparing the hydrogen uptake mediated by various substrates, e.g., multi wall CNTs (MWCNT) [17–23] and single wall CNTs (SWCNT) [24,25], graphite [26,27], activated carbon nanofiber [28,29], activated carbon [30–32] and graphene nanoplatelets [33]. Hydrogen SO step is followed either by hydrogen covalent binding (e.g., hydrogenation process) or by reversible physisorption of hydrogen to a solid support in hydrogen storage process. Therefore, it is important to isolate and to evaluate the contribution of the net SO step to the kinetics of the overall hydrogenation/adsorption process. The objective of the present research is to study the kinetic effect originated by adding a SO agent (e.g., pristine CNTs or various oxides) to the composite to be hydrogenated. We focus on the SO in a catalytic hydrogenation reaction of an unsaturated hydrocarbon (acceptor) such as diphenyl acetylene (DPA) or di-(phenylethynyl) benzene (DEB). The overall solid phase hydrogenation process includes both a SO step (slower) and the irreversible covalent bonding of the hydrogen to the acceptor (faster). The rate-determining step is the SO process, which is the focus of this study. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials 1,4-Di(phenylethynyl)benzene (DEB) was synthesized according to [34,35]. Diphenyl acetylene (DPA) was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Multi wall carbon nanotubes were purchased from Cheaptube (CT 20–30) and from Nanocyl (NC7000) and were used as received. The properties of the CNT are presented in Table 1 . Palladium on carbon 5%, silica fumed, silica and zirconia nanopowder were obtained from Aldrich, and Alumina nanopowder was purchased from Strem. 2.2 Preparation of a powdered sample for hydrogenation Spillover agents, e.g. oxides (0–1500mg) or pristine CNTs (0–150mg) and Pd/C (60–210mg) were grounded with hydrogen acceptors (DPA or DEB (1000mg)) in a Pulverisette 6 milling machine (Fritsch) in an agate bowl at 600rpm for 15min. 2.3 Kinetic measurements of hydrogenation The rate of hydrogenation was determined by following the decrease of hydrogen pressure during the reaction, using a home-made computer controlled Volumetric Pressure Measurement (a Sievert type apparatus) system (Fig. 1 ) [2]. A pyrex Reaction Chamber (RC) (Fig. 1) containing a solid mixture of an unsaturated hydrocarbon (DPA or DEB), a catalyst (Pd/C) and spillover agent (CNTs or oxides), is connected to the vacuum line. Following the evacuation, hydrogen is introduced to a calibrated volume and then transferred into the RC at the desired initial pressure. The hydrogen pressure is measured at an accuracy of ±0.013kPa (±0.1Torr). A multistage pulse hydrogenation process is then performed. The portion of hydrogen introduced at each pulse is 5% (or 10%) of the sample theoretical hydrogen capacity, as calculated from the number of acetylene bonds in the acceptor molecule (under our experimental conditions there is no hydrogenation of aromatic rings of the DPA or DEB, as proved by GC/MS [2]). The sample weight is adjusted to match an initial hydrogen pressure of 13.3kPa (the typical sample weight is 150–400mg). The measurement of the pressure drop for each portion is stopped when 98% of the hydrogen is consumed, unless the reaction rate is too slow, then the experiment is stopped after 12h. The introduction of additional hydrogen portions is finally stopped when the substrate reaches about 50% (or 80% in several experiments with DEB) of the theoretical hydrogen capacity, according to the experimental setup. We measured in situ the temperature in the reaction vessel during hydrogenation to make sure that a gas–solid reaction takes place. For both reactions (DEB and DPA) we found that the maximal temperature was well below the melting points of all the reagents (an example of a temperature profile for DPA is shown in Fig. S1 in supplementary materials). There was no ocular evidence of liquid appearance during the reaction for both systems. Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcata.2013.04.007. Supplementary Fig. I Temperature profiles for six consecutive portions during DPA hydrogenation (10 wt% of MWCNTs, 0.8 wt% of Pd). The maximal temperature obtained is 36°C, well below the melting point of DPA (62.5°C). The measured temperatures during further hydrogenation steps (portions 7–10) are even lower (not shown). A convenient measure of the reaction rate is the time needed to complete a given percent of the acceptor saturation. The cumulative time needed to reach this end point is termed t 50 or t 80. Fig. 2 a presents a typical time–pressure multistage hydrogenation of the DEB acceptor (each portion is 10% of the full capacity), where t x is an accumulative time to reach conversion of X% of hydrogenation. The first hydrogen portion (left curve) has a relatively longer initial delay due to the initial catalyst activation step. The last portion (right curve) is not completely consumed at the time scale of the experiment due to the slow rate of the reaction at this point. The conversion vs. time presentation enables one to compare between different samples. Fig. 2b shows the time dependence of the conversion of DPA hydrogenation as a function of the concentration of CNTs (here, each portion is 5% of the hydrogen theoretical capacity). The effect of MWCNTs addition could be clearly seen. Note that the time scale is logarithmic, thus the reaction rate is increased by almost three orders of magnitude by addition of 10% of MWCNT. Henceforth, t 50 and t 80 are used as the ordinate, while the abscissa will be the SO agent concentration in the sample (wt%). 2.4 Transmission electron microscope (TEM) TEM micrographs were obtained by FEI Tecnai 12 G2 TWIN TEM, operated at 120kV. The microscope was operated at 120kV at a low electron-dose mode (to reduce radiation damage) and at a few micrometers under focus to increase phase contrast. Images were recorded on a Gatan 794 CCD camera and analyzed by Digital Micrograph 3.6 software. 3 Results and discussion The hydrogen SO phenomenon was followed by tracking the kinetics of irreversible hydrogenation reaction. The influence of different types of SO agents, e.g. CNTs and oxides, at different concentrations was examined on the kinetics of two types of organic unsaturated substrates (DPA and DEB). The general hydrogenation behavior of DPA and DEB is similar while the reaction rate of DEB is faster than that of DPA. We chose to describe the irreversible solid phase hydrogenation without a SO agent, on the faster acceptor (DEB) as shown in Fig. 2a. The deceleration in the hydrogenation rates of the last portions (Fig. 2a) is a result of longer diffusion times of hydrogen to remote locations in the reacting composite. The distance from the active catalyst site (SO distance) increases with the hydrogenation progress due to the decrease in the non-hydrogenated DEB concentration. The addition of a SO agent is aimed at bridging this gap and increasing the SO rate [16], as shown below. 3.1 The effect of Spillover agents on the hydrogenation rate of DEB Two catalyst concentrations were studied: 0.8 and 0.5 wt% Pd. At the higher catalyst concentration the reaction rate is faster, as expected (t 80 values of 290min and 3200min, respectively – “diamonds” in Fig. 3 ). The hydrogenation rate is accelerated upon addition of a SO agent (either pristine MWCNT or oxides) as shown in Fig. 3. At the higher catalyst concentrations the SO agent effect becomes less prominent since the mean SO distance (catalyst-to-acceptor) is shorter. Upon addition of 15% of MWCNTS (circles in Fig. 3) t 80 values are reduced by 2.4 (to 120min) for the higher, and by 3.4 (to 930min) for the lower Pd concentration. The stronger effect at lower Pd concentration could indicate that this is indeed a result of H-spillover, which is more noticeable at lower catalyst concentration. Pd/C powder is characterized by dark, micron-size carbon particles as shown by TEM micrographs (Fig. 4a). The added CNTs are wrapped around the catalyst forming a tangled net (Fig. 4b). The intimate contact between the Pd catalyst (particles of 2–6nm size, Fig. 4c) and the CNTs (micrometers in length, Fig. 4b) is believed to assist in hydrogen SO. The effect of oxide SO agents on the hydrogenation kinetics was studied as well, as shown in Fig. 3. The effect of silica fume is the most dramatic one. It could reduce t 80 by more than one order of magnitude. The influence of the silica fume on the kinetics is stronger for the low Pd concentration, similar to the MWCNT case. The decreasing order of SO efficiency in the case of DEB hydrogenation is: silica fume>silica, MWCNT CT20-30>alumina (Fig. 3), while the reaction rates increase with the increase in the SO agent concentrations. 3.2 The contribution of the acceptor and SO agent type on the SO phenomenon The SO phenomenon is further studied by comparing the hydrogenation reactions of two different hydrogen acceptors (DPA vs. DEB). The effect of addition of SO agents on the hydrogenation time of both DPA and DEB is shown in Fig. 5 . Since the reaction rate of DPA is slower than that of DEB, t 50 is measured for both acceptors (instead of t 80 used above). Faster hydrogenation rates of DEB in comparison to DPA are an outcome of the unsaturation degree of the acceptor (one alkyne moiety for DPA and two for DEB) inducing intramolecular hydrogen SO. Indeed, the t 50 for DPA without a SO agent is four times longer than that of DEB (Fig. 5); in the absence of intramolecular SO in DPA the effect of addition of a SO agent is expected to be stronger since SO distances are mainly intermolecular. Our experiments indeed prove this hypothesis: the addition of 8–10% MWCNT (CT 20–30nm) accelerates the reaction of DEB and DPA by 2.5 and 50 fold, accordingly. Note that increasing MWCNT concentration has no effect on the initial hydrogenation rates (the first 5% portions in Fig. 2b). At the initial stage high concentration of unsaturated substrate exists in the vicinity of the catalyst and the presence of SO is of less importance. The SO agent becomes significant only later, when the reaction continues, and the reaching the unsaturated sites requires bridging. To assess the effect of the CNT characteristics on the SO we carried out experiments with two types of MWCNT, namely, CT 20–30nm and NC7000 (Table 1). While the hydrogenation rate scales with both SO agents concentration, the effect of Nanocyl NTs is clearly more substantial (Fig. 5). The faster kinetics induced by the NC7000 in comparison with the CT 20–30nm could stem from different chemical and physical properties (Table 1). Some parameters, which could be in favor of the NC7000 as a better SO agent are higher surface area, smaller diameter, higher defect density [36–39] and higher metal impurities. All oxides affect the hydrogenation rate at relatively high loading (>20wt%), while silica-fume is also active at lower loading; the addition of 8wt% silica fume results in a rate increase of two orders of magnitude (Fig. 5). Further increase in silica fume concentrations succeeded only in compensating a lower catalyst concentration (0.3–0.6wt% Pd) (Fig. 5, circled areas). Keeping the catalyst concentrations at high loading would have resulted in shorted t 50 values (Fig. 3). The effect of silica fume on the kinetics is significant in all the range of catalyst concentrations (0.3–0.8wt%) while for zirconia and alumina SO agents there is no effect at low loadings of oxide (<20%) as shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, the effect of zirconia and alumina loading at low Pd concentrations range (0.3–0.5%) is significant only at increased oxide concentration (45–60%). As for silica fume, high zirconia and alumina concentration compensates the low catalyst loading. The significant effect of fumed silica as a SO agent may be attributed to the catalytic activity of the silica itself [40] or to its surface defects [13,32]. In our experiments the catalytic activity of silica fume (without Pd/C) was relatively minor: only 7% conversion in more than 100h (see Fig. S2 in supplementary materials). On the other hand, silica fume has more surface defects than the other untreated oxides, which could explain a faster hydrogen transfer [13,32]. Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcata.2013.04.007. Supplementary Fig. II Conversion curves of DPA hydrogenation for different compositions of silica fumed and Pd/C, where each data point presents the conversion at cumulative time extracted from hydrogen pressure curves similar to Fig. 2a. One can clearly observe, that the catalytic effect of Silica Fumed without the catalyst is not significant and does not affect the reaction times of any of the herein shown experiments. The decreasing order of SO efficiency in the case of DPA hydrogenation is therefore: silica fume> MWCNT NC7000> MWCNT CT20-30>alumina>zirconia (Fig. 5), while the reaction rates are enhanced with increasing of the SO agent concentrations in the solid mixture. The trend corroborates with the SO efficiency for DEB. 4 Conclusions The hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrogen acceptors assisted by Palladium on carbon catalyst has been accelerated by the addition of either oxides or CNT as SO agents. We found that the reaction rate is proportional to the SO agent concentration. Addition of SO agents does not accelerate the initial rate of hydrogenation but has a substantial effect on the later steps. It is possible to minimize the amount of metallic Pd catalyst simply by adding SO agents to the composite, without any chemical treatment. The differences in hydrogenation rates for DPA and DEB could be interpreted in inter- and intra-molecular SO terms. The SO effect is more substantial when DPA is used as an acceptor. Silica fumed and CNTs are found as the best SO agents, while different types of CNT have different effects on the hydrogenation rate. A 3D net of tangled MWCNT around micron size active carbon particles is imaged by TEM. The morphology of this structure is in line with the secondary hydrogen SO step, in which hydrogen atoms migrate from the AC matrix to the conducting 3D net formed by the MWCNT.
