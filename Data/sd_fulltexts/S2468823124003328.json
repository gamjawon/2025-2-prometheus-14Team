Manganese-based catalysts show high activities in selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide (NO), but easily deactivated by sulfur dioxide. In this work, operation sequence and rare-earth-element doping were investigated to increase the anti-SO2 ability of Fe-doped manganese oxide (FM300). On one hand, when the catalyst pre-adsorbed NH3, SO2 only decreased the NO conversion from 100 % to 75 % at 200 °C. Otherwise, the conversion was decreased to 30 %. In-situ Diffuse Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy proved that NH3 competed with SO2 and protected part of the Brønsted acidic sites. On the other hand, rare-earth-element doping increased the long-time anti-SO2 performance of FM300 from 150 min to 300 min (Sm-FM300) and > 700 min (Ho-FM300). Differential Scanning Calorimeter analysis indicated that Ho optimized ferromagnetism of FM300, which was in favor of NH3 adsorption. The main result of this work will help to increase applicability of the manganese-based catalyst.

At present, NOx is resulted from fuel usage (such as fuel vehicle) and combustion process (such as incineration facility) [2]. Although fuel vehicle is being replaced by electric vehicle step by step, the later one is still indispensable. For example, incineration is a cost-effective technology to reduce the volume of municipal solid waste [3]. Combustion is also an important technology in many industries [4]. Therefore, emission treatment for NOx is necessary in these fields and effective methods include adsorption, selective non-catalytic reduction, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) [5,6]. Among these technologies, SCR has advantages of high efficiency and effortless operation. In a typical SCR, a catalyst accelerated the reaction among NOx, NH3, and O2, resulting in harmless H2O and N2 [7]. This process is determined by the catalyst, which controls the running temperature and cost. V2O5–WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 is a commercial catalyst and works effectively at above 240 °C [8,9]. However, temperature of flue gas is usually below 240 °C after bag filter in an incineration plant. If the catalyst is set before the bag filter, the catalyst surface is quickly covered by particle matters [10]. If the catalyst is set after the filter, the temperature must be increased by extra energy. Therefore, developing a low-temperature catalyst, which works effective at 160–200 °C, is urgently necessary. Various catalysts, such as Cu, Fe, and Mn, have showed low-temperature activities [11–13]. Among these low-cost transition metals, manganese oxide is widely investigated, and its SCR performance can be effectively enhanced by doping another element, such as Ce, Fe, Nb, and Sn [14]. However, Mn-based catalyst is quickly deactivated by SO2 [15]. According to previous reports, SO2 deactivates the Mn-based catalyst through forming metal sulfate/sulfite (chemically) and covering catalyst with ammonia bisulfate (physically) [16,17]. Unfortunately, SO2 usually co-exists with NOx. Although desulfurization is conducted before SCR, residual SO2 still has an accumulated effect on the SCR catalyst after a long-time running. Therefore, worldwide researchers try to modify the Mn-based catalyst to increase its SO2-resistence ability. For example, rare earth element (such as Ce, Eu, Ho, and Sm) doping is proven to be effective [18–20]. As for the mechanism, these metals play as sacrificial agents for SO2 or increase the amount of surface acidity, thus delaying the deactivation [21,22]. Apart from these two consensuses, new idea or deep understanding is hardly put forward in recent years. Therefore, this work investigated the method to increase the SO2-resistence ability of Mn-based catalyst. Different operation processes were first compared to select an optimized one for a better SO2-resistence performance. Rare-earth elements were then doped on the catalyst to further increase the SO2-resitence ability. Finally, a mechanism was put forward based on characterizations before and after SO2 contamination. The main result of this work not only helps to understand the nature of SO2 resistance but also is in favor of catalyst design. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparations Manganese oxides were first obtained by calcining manganese acetate tetrahydrate at 300, 400, or 800 °C for 2 h. Fe was doped on these oxides by an equal volume impregnation method. In brief, a ferric-nitrate solution (1 M) was mixed with the Mn oxides (200 mesh) and stirred for 1 h to obtain a precursor slurry. The slurry was dried at 105 °C for 24 h, and calcined at 300, 400, or 800 °C for 2 h. The obtained catalysts were denoted as FMX, where “X” stood for the calcination temperature. In comparison, a manganese oxide without Fe doping was denoted as M300. Moreover, FM300 was modified by adding samarium and holmium nitrate (0.2 M) in the above ferric-nitrate solution. The modified catalysts were denoted as Sm-FM300 and Ho-FM300. Doping contents in above catalysts were 2.5 ± 0.2 wt.% (Fe), 1.3 ± 0.1 wt.% (Sm), and 1.4 ± 0.2 wt.% (Ho), which were detected by an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (IRIS Advantage 1000, Thermo Fisher) after digestion. 2.2 Catalyst activities Temperature-programed SCR was carried out on a fixed-bed reactor [23]. First, 0.1 g of catalyst was set in a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 15 mm, and Ar flushed the reactor system for 30 min to clean residual air. A mixture gas flowed through the catalyst at a space velocity of 12,000 h−1. The mixture gas contained 1000 ppm of NO, 1000 ppm of NH3, 100 ppm of SO2, 2 % of H2O, and 3 % of O2. The mixture gas was also used to pre-contaminated a catalyst for 2 h at 200 °C and at 12,000 h−1. A FTIR analyzer (MultiGas 2030-HS High Speed, MKS) detected the NO concentration continuously. The analyzer was also used to detect NH3 catalytic oxidization. The NO concentration was detected for 30 min at each temperature to calculate the NO removal. Moreover, a long-time performance was conducted at 200 °C. 2.3 Characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using the XRD-6100 analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). N2 adsorption and desorption were detected on ASAP 2460 before a sample was degassed at 300 °C for 4 h. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were performed using a K-Alpha+ instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. In-situ Diffuse Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was carried out on Nicolet IS10 (Thermal Scientific) with an MCT detector (Harrick Scientific Products Inc.) [24]. In brief, NO+NH3+O2 flowed into the chamber after the catalyst was pre-treated by SO2, SO2+NH3, or SO2+NH3+O2. Thermogravimetric analysis together with Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TG-DSC, STA 449F5, NETZSCH) was conducted under air atmosphere and the heating rate was 10 K·min−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic performances FM300, FM400, and FM800 all showed low-temperature SCR activities (Fig. 1 ). Among the three catalysts, FM300 showed the best performance. FM300 removed 89 % of NO at 100 °C and the conversions were close to 100 % after 120 °C (Fig. 1 A). In comparison, FM400 attained a conversion of 100 % after 150 °C (Fig. 1B). As for FM800, its best removal was 87 % at 200 °C (Fig. 1C). After these catalysts were pre-contaminated by different SO2-containing gases, two kinds of phenomena were observed. (1) If one catalyst was pre-contaminated by SO2 or SO2+NO, the catalytic performance was significantly decreased. NO conversion of FM300 was decreased from 100 % to 31 % at 200 °C. FM400 got a conversion of 100 % at 175 °C, which was decreased to 14 % after the catalyst was pre-treated by SO2. NO conversion of FM800 was even decreased from 87 % to 10 % at 200 °C. (2) If one catalyst was pre-contaminated by SO2+NH3 or SO2+NH3+O2, although the catalytic performance was still decreased, the obtained conversion was better than the first condition. For example, SO2+NH3 decreased the NO conversion of FM300 at 175 °C from 99 % to 91 %, which was far better than that (21 %) of SO2-FM300. Similarly, SO2+NH3+O2 had little influence on FM400 at 200 °C since the conversion was only decreased to 95 %, which was far better than that (22 %) of SO2-FM400. Fig. 1D compares the catalytic performances of FM300, Sm-FM300, and Ho-FM300. Sm doping further increased the conversion of FM300. In comparison, Ho doping decreased the conversion from 100 % to 80 % before 175 °C. Note that both Ho and Sm oxides had no ability in SCR. Fig. S1 shows their H2-TPR in the supporting information. The reductive temperature followed the order of Sm-FM300 < FM300 < Ho-FM300, which was consistent with the conversion order. Sm doping increased the reductive ability while Ho doping slightly decreased the reductive ability. FM300, Ho-FM300, and Sm-FM300 all attained a conversion of 100 % at 200 °C (Fig. 1E). The conversion of FM300 showed a rapid decrease after 140 min. The high conversion of Sm-FM300 maintained for 300 min, and was decreased to 70 % at 500 min. In comparison, the high conversion of Ho-FM300 lasted for over 750 min. Although the conversion was decreased from 100 % to 87 % when 2 % of H2O was added into the gaseous phase, the conversion returned to 100 % when H2O was stopped (Fig. S2). Therefore, NH3 pre-treatment and rare-earth element doping both helped the catalyst to resist SO2. 3.2 Crystal and textural properties FM300 showed two phases (Fig. 2 A). A main phase showed diffractions at 18.0, 29.0, 32.4, 36.1, 58.7, and 60.0 °, which were attributed to Mn3O4 (PDF#75-1560) [25]. A secondary phase was MnO (PDF#75-0626) and its diffractions were recognized at 34.9, 40.6, and 58.7 ° [26]. XRD pattern of FM400 was similar to that of FM300, except that MnO diffraction intensities in FM400 were weaker than those in FM300. MnO phase was weakened by a higher activation temperature. Although FM800 still showed a phase of Mn3O4, the strongest diffractions were observed at 23.1, 32.9, and 55.1 °, which belonged to Mn2O3 (PDF#89-4836) [27]. The XRD of Sm-FM300 and Ho-FM300 were similar to that of FM300. Except for these Mn oxides, no impurity, such as Fe, Sm, and Ho oxides, was recognizable. Thus, Fe, Sm, and Ho were well dispersed. After above catalysts were contaminated by SO2, the XRD almost maintained the fresh patterns. Thus, the decreased activity in Fig. 1 was not resulted from the crystal changing after SO2 contamination. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are compared in Fig. 2B. According to the IUPAC classification, all the isotherms were characteristic type-IV curves, indicating mesoporous structure [28,29]. FM300 had a specific surface area of 19.3 m2 g−1, which was bigger than those (12.3–12.5 m2 g−1) of FM400 and FM800 (Table 1 ). On the contrary, rare-earth-element doping slightly increased the specific surface area to 23.3 m2 g−1 (Sm-FM300) and 24.5 m2 g−1 (Ho-FM300). Pore volume and pore size were both decreased in FM400 and FM800 but increased in Sm-FM300 and Ho-FM300. A higher-temperature activation resulted in a more serious sintering, while hetero-atom doping retarded the crystal growth and kept the material with a higher surface area at a same sintering temperature [30]. In comparison to the fresh catalyst, the SO2-contaminated one showed a smaller specific surface area. For example, the specific surface area of FMn300 was decreased from 19.30 to 14.20 m2 g−1. Although the specific surface area was decreased, the conversion of Ho-FM300-SO2 showed no obvious decrease (Fig. 1). In addition, FM800, FM300-SO2, and Ho-FM300-SO2 had a similar specific surface area but quite different conversions. Therefore, SO2 contamination affected other factors determining the SCR activity rather than the textural property. 3.3 Surface elements Fe 2p contained Fe2+ (710.9 eV) and Fe3+ (713.8 eV) in Fig. 3 A [31]. Mn 2p was made up of three valences [32], including Mn2+ (640.9 eV), Mn3+ (642.1 eV), and Mn4+ (643.8 eV) (Fig. 3B). O 1s was fitted into lattice oxygen (530.0 eV, Oα), adsorbed oxygen (531.3 eV, Oβ), and hydroxyl oxygen (532.7 eV, Oγ) (Fig. 3C) [33,34]. S 2p was divided into SO3 2− (168.3 eV) and SO4 2− (169.4 eV) (Fig. 3D) [35]. The detailed fitting results are listed in Table 2 . FM300 had 64.7 % of Fe2+ and 35.3 % of Fe3+. After the catalyst was contaminated by SO2, the ratio of Fe2+ was decreased to 53.5 %. If the catalyst was contaminated by SO2+NH3+O2, the ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ almost maintained same values. Similar phenomenon was observed in Mn-species ratios. FM300 was made up 18.0 % of Mn2+, 41.3 % of Mn3+, and 40.7 % of Mn4+. After SO2 contamination, the ratio of Mn2+ was increased to 29.3 %. Simultaneously, the other ratios were decreased to 31.9 % (Mn3+) and 38.7 % (Mn4+). In SO2+NH3+O2-FM300, the Mn ratios were similar to those of FM300. O species was divided into 65.9 % of Oα, 21.2 % of Oβ, and 8.9 % of Oγ in FM300. After SO2 contamination, the ratio of Oβ was obviously increased to 30.1 %. In comparison, the oxygen ratios of SO2+NH3+O2-FM300 were similar to those of FM300. According to these comparisons, pre-adding NH3 protected Fe-, Mn-, and O-species ratios, which were significantly disturbed if being exposed to SO2. As for the S species, the ratios were similar in the two SO2-contanminated catalysts. 3.4 Surface intermediates and processes When FM300 was exposed to SO2 for 30 min (Fig. 4 A), a strong peak was observed within 800–1400 cm−1. The bands at 1263 and 1142 cm−1 were attributed to metal sulfate, and the band at 1041 cm−1 was resulted from S–O stretching vibration of bidentate sulfates [36,37]. After this period, SO2 was stopped and SCR gases (NH3+NO+O2) flowed into the chamber. The SO2-adsorbed band almost kept the same pattern and intensity. However, a new band at 1430 cm−1 was recognized after 8 min. This band was attributed to NH4 + and nitrate adsorbed by Brønsted acidic sites [38,39], which played an important intermediate of SCR [40]. When FM300 was exposed to SO2+NH3+O2 for 30 min (Fig. 4B), the strong SO2-band was still formed. Interestingly, the NH4 + band (1428 cm−1) also formed. After SCR gases flowed into the chamber, the band intensities were hardly changed. Similar phenomena were observed in SO2+NH3-FM300 (Fig. 4C). The relative intensity between NH4 + band and metal-sulfate band was 0.09 (SCR 15 min) in SO2-FM300. The relative intensity was increased to 0.20 in SO2+NH3+O2-FM300 and 0.18 in SO2+NH3-FM300. Considering this, NH3 occupied Brønsted acidic sites as NH4 + and nitrate. These sites were thus feasible to participate in SCR. Otherwise, if all sites were occupied by SO2, only weak-adsorbed SO2 species were replaceable by NH3. This explained why NH3 pre-adsorption was in favor of afterward SCR. Similar results were obtained in Fig. S3, which compared the SCR processes after FM400, FM800 or Ho-FM300 were exposing to SO2 and SO2+NH3+O2. 3.5 Mechanism discussion Fig. 5 A shows the DSC and DDSC curves of FM300. FM300 showed an obvious endothermic peak at 530 °C while M300 only showed a weak peak at 657 °C. As is well-known, the Curie point of Fe3O4 and Mn3O4 are 863 and 43 K, respectively [41], and DSC is feasible to detect the Curie point [42,43]. Transition-metal doping enhanced ferromagnetism of Mn3O4 [44]. Therefore, the DDSC peak was attributed to the Curie point of FM300. FM300 was ferromagnetic before this point and paramagnetic after this point. After Sm was doped on FM300, the Curie point became ambiguous and only a weak DDSC peak was recognized at 596 °C (Fig. 5B). Thus, Sm doping significantly decreased the ferromagnetism. When Ho was doped on FM300, the Curie point was observed at 590 °C (Fig. 5C). After all, the ferromagnetism followed the order of FM300 > Ho-FM300 > Sm-FM300. Fig. 5D put forwards the SO2-resistence mechanism. Dipole moment of SO2 was 1.60 μ (Debye) while dipole moment of NH3 was 1.30 μ (Debye) [45]. In addition, adsorbed SO2 also showed a bigger dipole moment of 4.82 μ (Debye) than adsorbed NH3 (2.89 μ (Debye)) [46]. The bigger dipole moment made SO2 fly a longer distance than NH3 along with the magnetic induction line. As a result, NH3 had a chance to occupy the Brønsted acidic sites as NH4 + and nitrate (Figs. 4 and S1), which was in favor of SCR (Fig. 1). In comparison, when M300 was contaminated by SO2, co-existing NH3 had no advantage in occupying reactive sites on paramagnetic M300. This was the reason why M300-SO2 had M300-SO2+NH3 had similar poor catalytic activities (Fig. S4). Similarly, FM800 was almost paramagnetic because of the high-temperature calcination above the Curie point. Thus, NH3 pre-treatment only had little ability in protecting the reactive sites. O2 had different roles in the above mechanism. FM300, FM400, and FM800 were compared in NH3 catalytic oxidization under NH3 and NH3+O2 (Fig. S5). The activity followed the order of FM300 > FM400 > FM800 under NH3+O2. When no O2 was supplied, the order was FM300 > FM400 ≈ FM800, but the conversions were all very low. When FM300 was pre-treated by SO2+NH3+O2, adsorbed NH3 was consumed by NH3 catalytic oxidization [47]. The released site was then potentially occupied by SO2. In comparison, when FM300 was pre-treated by SO2+NH3, adsorbed NH3 was not greatly consumed. As a result, FM300-SO2+NH3+O2 had a lower conversion than FM300-SO2+NH3. As for FM400 and FM800, O2 converted NH3 to adsorbed nitrate (Fig. 4), which was more difficult to replace than NH4 + by SO2. As a result, FM400/800-SO2+NH3+O2 had a lower conversion than FM400/800-SO2+NH3. When Sm was doped on FM300, the ferromagnetism was hindered (Fig. 5B). Either SO2 or NH3 easily approach each active site on the catalyst. In this case, Sm functioned as a sacrificial agent for SO2. However, after Sm was consumed up, the anti-SO2 ability disappeared (Fig. 1E) [48]. When Ho was doped on FM300, the ferromagnetism was hindered just to a certain degree (Fig. 5C). In this case, SO2 still travelled a longer distance than NH3 along with the magnetic induction line. Although Ho sites were still occupied by SO2, no more SO2 was further adsorbed when SO2 travelled along the magnetic induction line. In other words, some Brønsted acidic sites were only accessible for NH3, which ensure a long-time performance of Ho-FM300 (Fig. 1E). 4 Conclusion In this work, three Mn-based catalysts were synthesized and compared in NO-SCR. After being exposed to different SO2-containing gases, co-exiting NH3 make the catalyst have better NO conversions. In-situ DRIFTS revealed that NH3 was feasible to compete with SO2 and protect part of Brønsted acidic sites. After being doped by Sm, the long-time anti-SO2 performance was increased from 150 min to 300 min. What's more, Ho doping increased the long-time performance to > 700 min. DSC analysis indicated that Ho optimized ferromagnetism of the catalyst and made it more favorable for NH3 adsorption. In comparison, Sm doping over decreased the ferromagnetism and functioned as a sacrificial agent for SO2. These results are in favor of promoting the applicability of Mn-based catalyst and deliver a new understanding of anti-SO2 ability.

        "dc:description": "Manganese-based catalysts show high activities in selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide (NO), but easily deactivated by sulfur dioxide. In this work, operation sequence and rare-earth-element doping were investigated to increase the anti-SO2 ability of Fe-doped manganese oxide (FM300). On one hand, when the catalyst pre-adsorbed NH3, SO2 only decreased the NO conversion from 100 % to 75 % at 200 °C. Otherwise, the conversion was decreased to 30 %. In-situ Diffuse Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy proved that NH3 competed with SO2 and protected part of the Brønsted acidic sites. On the other hand, rare-earth-element doping increased the long-time anti-SO2 performance of FM300 from 150 min to 300 min (Sm-FM300) and > 700 min (Ho-FM300). Differential Scanning Calorimeter analysis indicated that Ho optimized ferromagnetism of FM300, which was in favor of NH3 adsorption. The main result of this work will help to increase applicability of the manganese-based catalyst.",
