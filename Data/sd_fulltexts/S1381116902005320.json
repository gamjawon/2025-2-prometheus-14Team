Metallic Lewis acids-catalyzed acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride and acetic acid in ionic liquids: study on reactivity and reusability of the catalysts Sang-gi Lee ∗ Jung Hwan Park Life Sciences Division, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, P.O. Box 131, Cheongryang 130-650, South Korea * Corresponding author. Tel.: +82-2-958-5163; fax: +82-2-958-5189. Catalytic activity and reusability of metallic Lewis acids such as Cu(OTf)2, Yb(OTf)3, Sc(OTf)3, In(OTf)3, HfCl4·(THF)2 and InCl3 for acetylation of alcohols were examined in room temperature ionic liquids. The catalytic activity and reusability of the metallic Lewis acids, Cu(OTf)2, Yb(OTf)3, Sc(OTf)3, In(OTf)3, HfCl4·(THF)2 and InCl3, for acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride and acetic acid has been examined in environmentally benign room temperature ionic liquids, [bmim][X] (bmim=1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, X=PF6, BF4, SbF6). All of the catalysts effectively catalyzed the acetylation with acetic anhydride in an ionic liquid, [bmim][PF6]. In direct acetylation with acetic acid, Yb(OTf)3, Sc(OTf)3 and InCl3 showed excellent catalytic activity in the [bmim][PF6] ionic liquid and were reasonably recycled. Keywords Ionic liquids Lewis acids Catalyst Alcohol Acylation 1 Introduction The acylation of alcohols is one of the most frequently used processes in organic synthesis [1]. In its long history, numerous methods have been devised. Acylation of alcohols is typically performed with acid anhydrides in the presence of basic catalysts such as 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine (PPY) [2]. More recently, various metallic triflates including Cu(OTf)2 [3], Sc(OTf)3 [4], Yb(OTf)3 [4c], In(OTf)3 [5], Bi(OTf)3 [6] and HfCl4·(THF)2 [7], etc. have been reported to be effective catalysts for acylation with acetic anhydride or acetic acid. These catalysts are very useful, but also suffer from some drawbacks. Metal triflates are rather expensive and some of them are liable to air and moisture. Moreover, although some of the reactions are conducted without solvent, these metallic Lewis acid catalysts are frequently used for acylation in environmentally harmful organic solvents such as CH2Cl2. In viewpoint of today’s environmental consciousness, the use of environmentally benign reaction mediums is very important. In this connection, room temperature ionic liquids that are air and moisture stable have received in recent years a good deal of attention as potential cleaner solvents [8]. Deng et al. reported for the first time an application of an ionic liquid, 1-butylpyridinium chloride-aluminum(III) chloride, as a catalyst and reaction medium for acylation of alcohol with acetic acid [9]. Quite recently, Imrie et al. carried out DCC/DMAP promoted esterifications of ferrocenemonocarboxylic acid in ionic liquids [10]. Utilization of the ionic liquids particularly in metal-catalyzed reactions allowed easy recovery and reuse of the catalysts. During our ongoing study on catalyst recycling, we have found Sc(OTf)3, La(OTf)3 and InCl3 are effectively immobilized in room temperature ionic liquids, especially, consisting of 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations [bmim][X] (Fig. 1 ) [11]. Prompted by these results, we decided to examine the catalytic activity and reusability of the well-known metallic Lewis acids, Cu(OTf)2, Yb(OTf)3, Sc(OTf)3, In(OTf)3, HfCl4·(THF)2 and InCl3 in ionic liquids for acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride and acetic acid. Here we wish to report the results. 2 Results and discussion To examine the catalytic activity of the Lewis acids in ionic liquids, acetylation of benzyl alcohol with acetic anhydride was chosen as a model reaction. In the presence of 1mol.% of catalyst, an equimolar mixture of benzyl alcohol and acetic anhydride in [bmim][PF6] was stirred at 20°C, and followed by TLC until all starting benzyl alcohol was consumed (Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1, all catalysts examined are very effective in acetylation of benzyl alcohol in the ionic liquid [bmim][PF6]. Among the catalysts, Cu(OTf)2 showed the highest catalytic activity, the reaction being completed in 5min (entry 1). Notable is that InCl3 also can be an effective catalyst for acylation (entry 6). Because of its stability in water and unique capability to impart high selectivity in various chemical transformations, InCl3 has recently received attention [12]. However, to date, acylation of alcohol using InCl3 as a catalyst has not been reported in literature yet. (Recently, InI3 has been used as a catalyst for transesterification. See [13].) One of the primary aims of our study was to investigate the recycling of the metallic Lewis acid catalysts. Clearly this is important in the context of economic feasibility and sustainable development. Thus, the recovered catalysts, which were immobilized in [bmim][PF6], were reused in the second run. The catalytic activities of Cu(OTf)2 and InCl3 were dramatically decreased to give the desired ester in only 16% (entry 1) and 33% (entry 6) yield, respectively. Similarly, the catalytic activities of the In(OTf)3 and HfCl4·(THF)2 also decreased in the second and third cycles (entries 4 and 5). In contrast, Yb(OTf)3 (entry 2) and Sc(OTf)3 (entry 3) almost retained their catalytic activities in the second cycle, but their activities decreased drastically in the third cycle. We next examined the catalytic activity of these catalysts for direct acetylation of benzyl alcohol with equimolar amount of acetic acid in ionic liquids (Table 2 ). Initially, the reaction was carried out in [bmim][PF6] at 20°C for 12h in the presence of 1mol.% of Sc(OTf)3, but the reaction was not completed, and afforded the product ester in only 64% yield (entry 1 in Table 2). The yield was not increased at all in other ionic liquids, such as [bmim][BF4] (21%, entry 2) and [bmim][SbF6] (46%, entry 3). Fortunately, when the reaction time was prolonged to 48h, the product was formed in 98% yield (entry 4). It has also been found that Yb(OTf)3 (95%, entry 5 in Table 2) and InCl3 (95%, entry 6 in Table 2) also effectively catalyzed the acetylation with acetic acid. However, when the solvent/catalyst system recovered from the First cycle were re-used, the catalytic activities were slightly decreased (entries 4–7). Unfortunately, at the present time it is not easy to explain the reason for the decreased catalytic activity of the recovered catalysts. Finally, acetylation of various alcohols with acetic anhydride has been carried out in [bmim][PF6] in the presence of 1mol.% of Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst at 20°C for 1h. As shown in Table 3 , all of the primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols as well as phenol were perfectly acetylated. 3 Experimental 3.1 General remarks All reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Column chromatography was performed using Kieselgel 60 (230–400mesh) and TLC was carried out using glass sheets pre-coated with silica gel 60F254 purchased from Merck. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 spectrometer. All other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used as received. 3.2 Synthesis of [bmim][X] All ionic liquids were prepared from [bmim][Cl] [14]. To a solution of [bmim][Cl] (1 equivalent) in anhydrous acetone at room temperature was added 1 equivalent of sodium hexafluorophosphate for [bmim][PF6], sodium tetrafluoroborate for [bmim][BF4] or sodium hexafluoroantimonate for [bmim][SbF6]. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24h at 20°C and was then filtered through a plug of Celite. The volatile was removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in methylene chloride and washed with water several times. After evaporation of the methylene chloride, ionic liquid was vacuum dried for 2 days and stored under an atmosphere of dry argon. All ionic liquids contained less than 10ppm of chlorine according to the chlorine analysis at Analysis Center in Korea Institute of Science and Technology and less than 15ppm of water according to the Karl Fischer analysis (Metrolm model: 756KF Coulometer). 3.3 General acetylation procedure Acetic anhydride or acetic acid (1.93mmol) and alcohols (1.93mmol) were added to a solution of catalyst (0.019mmol) in 1.0ml of ionic liquids at 20°C under N2 atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1h. Upon completion of the reaction, the organic materials were extracted with benzene (5 ml×4). When recycling the solvent/catalyst system, fresh alcohol and acetic anhydride (or acetic acid) were added again. After removing benzene, the product was purified by silica-gel chromatographic separation. 4 Conclusions The catalytic activities of the metallic Lewis acids, Cu(OTf)2, Sc(OTf)3, Yb(OTf)3, In(OTf)3, HfCl4·(THF)2 and InCl3, for acetylation of alcohols with acetic anhydride and acetic acid were examined in room temperature ionic liquids. All of these catalysts exhibited extremely high catalytic activity in acetylation with acetic anhydride in [bmim][PF6]. It has also been found that Sc(OTf)3, Yb(OTf)3 and InCl3 can be effective catalysts for acetylation of benzylalcohol with acetic acid in [bmim][PF6] ionic liquid. Although the catalytic activity of the recovered catalysts was decreased upon recycling, these results may offer an opportunity to use metallic Lewis acid-catalysts for acylation of alcohols in environmentally benign ionic liquids.
