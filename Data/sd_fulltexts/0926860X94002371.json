The reduction process and the phase evolution during reduction of the mixed oxides was followed by temperature-programmed reduction and XRD. The mixed oxides were acti- vated in an HJN2 flow and then tested as catalysts in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of y-butyro- lactone (GBL) and a solution of maleic anhydride (MA) in GBL (60:40 w/w). Depending on composition, heating temperature and atmosphere, the samples contained different phases, such as CuO, CdO, Cr203, CuCrO2, CuCrO4, ce-CdCrO4, cubic and tetragonal CuCr204, and cubic Cu-Zn and Cu-Cd spinel-type phases. The partial substitution of Cu2 + ions with Zn2 + or Cd2 + ions stabilizes the cubic form of the spinel-type phases, which form via intermediate chromate phases. The final product of reduction in all cases is metallic copper. Cubic CuCr204 is more reducible than the corresponding tetragonal phase, which reduces to metallic copper through the intermediate formation of CuCrO2. The presence of zinc or cadmium promotes or inhibits, respectively, the copper reducibility both in CuO and in the copper chromite spinel. In the hydrogenation of GBL, the Cu/Cr catalysts obtained by calcination show similar behaviours, with a small increase in activity as a function of the copper content. At the lower temperatures investigated the main products are tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-butanol, while at 548 K significant amounts of ethanol are observed, favoured by increasing copper content. On the other hand, the Cu/Cr catalyst obtained by heating under a reduced oxygen atmosphere, for which only tetragonal CuCrzO4 is detected before reduction, shows a decrease in catalytic activity. Partial substitution of the Cu2+ ions gives rise to a decrease in GBL conversion, with a considerable deactivation when Cd2 + ions are present.

With the MA/GBL solution, the partial substitution of Cd2+ ions for Cu2+ ions also gives rise to considerable deactivation. For the other catalysts, the main products at the lower temperatures are GBL and succinic anhydride (SA), while at 548 K overhydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions predominate. The presence of Zn2+ ions gives rise to an increase in yield in GBL, due to an increase in the hydrogenation activity toward SA, but the consecutive transformation of GBL at high temper- ature to low cost by-products is not inhibited. On the other hand, the presence in the Cu/Cr catalyst of only CuCr204 increases the yield in GBL, as a consequence of a strong inhibition of the overhy- drogenation and/or hydrogenolysis reactions of GBL. With the MA/GBL solution, similar behaviours are observed when the H2/C4 molar ratio decreases. At the same time, however, the lack in the carbon balance increases and a displacement towards high temperature of the maximum yield in GBL is found.

Introduction Copper-chromium mixed oxides in a partially reduced state are well known as excellent catalysts for many reactions, such as hydrogenation of organic compounds [ 1-5 ], alcohol decomposition or dehydrogenation of alcohols [ 6,7 ], ester hydro- genolysis ] 8], etc. The resistance of chromite catalysts to heat and inhibitors seems to be superior to that of metallic copper. Furthermore, some metal oxides (e.g., BaO) may be incorporated into the catalyst and act as promoters or stabilizing agents. Notwithstanding the many papers dealing with the characterization of these systems [9-13], their composition and structure have not been completely explained, taking into account also that these catalysts may be prepared, pretreated and used in different ways, and that their nature can be varied by changing the copper-to-chromium ratio. The preparation and characterization of new Cu/Cr phases, distinguished by an excess of chromium ions have also been reported [ 14-17]. For these catalysts direct relationships have been reported between the activity, the concentration of cuprous ions in an octahedral environment and the concentration of occluded hydrogen [ 17-19]. In previous papers, we have shown that the synthesis of non-stoichiometric spinel-type phases may be a key tool for the preparation of tailored catalysts with specific activities in different hydrogenation reactions [ 20,21 ]. In particular, it was found that the substitution of part of the copper ions with other divalent ions strongly modifies the activity and yield of the catalysts [21-23]. The objective of the research reported here was to investigate the reaction involved in the synthesis of these spinel-type phases. The main goal was to document changes in the structure and reactivity related to the presence of excess copper ions and to their partial substitution with other divalent ions. In particular, we examined the vapour-phase G.L. Castiglioni et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 125 hydrogenation of maleic anhydride (MA) to y-butyrolactone (GBL) and tetrah- ydrofuran (THF), which are widely required as solvents and industrial intermedi- ates for the production of medicines and polymers [ 24-26 ]. Hydrogenation of MA is an interesting way to produce GBL or THF, taking into account that (i) hazardous feedstocks are not required; (ii) it is the most simple and direct way to produce GBL and THF [24-26], and (iii) MA may be considered a feedstock, since it is available in large amounts and at low cost as the result of the construction of large fluid-bed plants (about 50 000 t/y) based on Alusuisse-Lummus and BP/UCB technologies [ 25-28 ]. 2. Experimental All samples (Table 1 ) were obtained by coprecipitation at pH 8.0 from a solution of the nitrates of the elements with a slight excess of NaHCO> The precipitates were washed until the sodium concentration was lower than 0.1% w/w (as Na20), then dried at 363 K and calcined for 24 h at 653,753 and 853 K. For Cat 1 and Cat 4, samples were also prepared by calcination of the precursor at 593 K and heating at 753 K in vacuum (P< 1.3 Pa), respectively. Cat 5 was obtained by heating the same precipitate used for Cat 1 under reduced air pressure (ca. 66 Pa) at 653 K for 24 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns for the unreduced materials were recorded using a Philips PW 1050 / 81 diffractometer controlled by a PW 1710 unit and Ni-filtered Cu Ko~ radiation. The phase evolution during the reduction process was studied by XRD in an Anton-Paar HTKI0 camera attached to a Philips dif- fractometer equipped with an inner heating block-sample holder, and with variable temperature and feed controls. The samples calcined at 653 K were reduced step by step in the temperature range 393-673 K for 10 min at each step of 20 K in a flow of 45-50 ml min i of an H2/N2 mixture (6:94 v/v). The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded in the range of 20 = 28-44 since this is the range in which the strongest X-ray reflections of the initial and most likely reduced phases present occur. An X-ray diffraction line originating from the platinum sample holder was used as an internal standard reference line for comparison of the relative intensities of the reflections of the phases present. The main results of the in situ reduction XRD investigation are reported in Table 2 and the XRD patterns of the most important samples are discussed in detail. Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra were recorded using a Cary 2300 spectrometer equipped with an IBM PS2 computer for data acquisition and analysis, in the 40 000-4000 cm J range, covering the UV, visible and near-infrared regions. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using the KBr disk technique and a Perkin- Elmer 1700 Fourier-transform (FT-IR) spectrometer in the 4000-400 cm 1 range. A Carlo Erba Sorpty 1750 apparatus with nitrogen adsorption was used to meas- ure the surface area of the samples. 126 G.L.

Hydrogen uptake observed and calculated on the basis of the content of reducible species in the initial phases. The carbonate content in the dried precipitates was determined, after chemical attack with concentrated HzSO4 and subsequent absorption of carbon dioxide in 0.1 M NaOH, by titration with 0.1 M HC1, using a digital microburette (Amel model 233). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer TGS-2 thermobalance, with a nitrogen flow of 50 ml min- ~ and a constant heating rate of 10 K min i For some samples the analysis was also carried out under a flow of air. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) tests of the samples calcined at 653 K were made in a home made apparatus using an Hz/N2 flOW (6:94 V/V) of 50 ml min-~, with a heating rate of 1 K min - ~, starting from room temperature up to 513 K. The weights of the samples were 38.7, 10.2, 11.0, 30.4 and 30.0 mg for Cat 1, Cat 2, Cat 3, Cat 4 and Cat 5, respectively. A preliminary study showed that the reduction profiles were not affected by diffusion phenomena up to a sample mass of 100 mg. The amounts of both hydrogen uptake and water formed were determined. The samples were always pretreated in an oxygen flow at about 650 K in order to eliminate traces of impurities and adsorbed water. For Cat 5 the TPR test was also carried out up to 873 K. The catalytic tests were carried out using 2.0 +_ 0.2 g of catalyst calcined at 653 K (0.420-0.841 mm particle size) in a copper tubular microreactor (internal diam- eter 2 ram, length 520 mm), operating at atmospheric pressure in the 453-573 K range. The reactor was fed with a stream of MA/GBL solution (60:40 w/w) in hydrogen [ H2 / C4 = 170 and 69 ( mol / tool) ]. Preliminary catalytic tests with GBL [Hz/GBL = 173 and 69 (mol/mol)] were also carried out, taking into account both that GBL is an intermediate in the hydrogenation of MA and that it is also the solvent employed to feed MA, because most of the usual solvents react preferen- tially with MA. The organic feedstock was introduced by an Infors Precidor model 5003 infusion pump. Before the catalytic tests, the samples were activated in situ at atmospheric pressure in an H2/N2 flow (5:95 v/v), while progressively increas- 128 G.L. Castiglioni et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 ing the temperature from room temperature (R.T.) to 598 K. The reaction products were analyzed in-line without condensation using a Carlo Erba 4300 gas chromat- ograph equipped with FID and two columns ( 3.2 mm2.0 m) filled with Porapack QS. The surface area of the copper in the catalysts tested was determined in situ, after reduction, by the nitrous oxide pulse technique at room temperature, as reported in the literature [ 29,30]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the precursors All the dried precipitates (green in colour) show XRD patterns typical of quasi- amorphous phases, with only the exception of Cat 4, in which a crystalline CdCO~ phase also is detected (Table 1 ). The precipitates were identified as hydroxycar- bonates on the basis of IR analysis [31 ]. Independently from the chemical com- I position, all the samples display a large absorption band in the 600-400 cm range, attributable to a M-O vibration, the intensity of which is related to the chromium content [ 32]. The presence of a chromium hydroxide-type phase may thus be hypothesized, also taking into account the occurrence of an absorption band of lower intensity at 830 cm- i. The splitting of the ~'3 frequency of carbonate with the appearance of two bands in the 1500-1350 cm-l range (with a separation between the peaks of about 100 cm- 1, typical of basic salts) and the presence of a shoulder at about 1050 cm 1 are evidence of a basic salt with a low degree of symmetry of the carbonate [ 31,33,34]. Moreover, the high intensity of the band at 1630 cm- 1 suggests that it is not only related to the bending vibration of water but also to the presence of bicarbonate. In any case, the low degree of symmetry of carbonate and the presence of bicarbonate are not in contradiction with each other, and both species may be present at the same time. It can be seen from the data of the analysis of the carbonates in the samples examined (Table 1 ), that the experi- mental values are always lower than those calculated on the basis of the presence of some possible hydroxy (carbonate)-type phases, such as malachite, aurichalcite, hydrozincite or hydrotalcite-type phases. This fact may be explained taking into account the tendency of the Cr3 + ions to form polynuclear complexes containing hydroxylic bridges, with the formation, in a basic environment, of a 'chromic hydroxide' [35]. This hypothesis explains the very low amount of carbonate detected for the sample with the highest chromium content (Cat 1 ). The reflectance spectra of the precursors of Cat 1, Cat 2, Cat 3 and Cat 4 are reported in Fig. la, b, c and d, respectively. Apart from the band (w) at lower energy (ca. 5000 cm- l), due to surface water, the DR spectra show the occurrence of several bands: bands (i) and (ii) at ca. 7000-8000 and 12 500 cm 1, respec- tively, correspond to Cu2 + ions in a distorted octahedral symmetry, while bands G.L.

(a) ,Cat 1 (Cu/Cr = 67:33); (b) Cat 2 (Cu/Cr = 50:50); (c) Cat 3 (Cu/Zn/Cr = 40:10:50); and (d) Cat 4 (Cu/Cd/Cr = 40:10:50, atomic ratio percent). (iii), (iv) and (v) at ca. 14 500, 18 000 and 24 000 cm- l, respectively, are due to Cr3 + ions in octahedral symmetry [36]. These observations are consistent with the presence of hydroxy(carbonate)-type structures where the oxygen atoms are nearly octahedrally coordinated to the metals. The thermograms carried out in nitrogen on the precursors show in all cases a total weight loss in the 31-35% range. The main loss occurs up to about 693 K and may be attributed to the elimination of the coordinated water [ 37,38], even though it is not possible to exclude a contribution related to partial decomposition of the carbonates. The weight loss at higher temperatures may be attributed, on the basis of the IR analysis, to the decomposition of the carbonates and small amounts of chromates formed in the previous step. The temperature of this last transition is a function of the composition of the system, and decreases with the lowering of the chromium content and the partial substitution of the copper ions with other divalent ions in the following order: Tcu > Tcd> Tzn. It must be noted that this order does not correspond to the decomposition temperature of the different carbonates and/ or hydroxycarbonates reported in the literature [ 37]. Indeed it seems more likely to be related to the tendency to form spinel-type phases, whose order of formation should be: Zn > Cd > Cu. The heating atmosphere influences the decomposition; in particular, when TG analysis of Cat 2 was carried out in air (i.e. as during calcination) a decrease in the temperature range of the loss of coordination water was observed, with a corresponding increase in the amount of chromates formed. Moreover, in this case it is possible to determine clearly the weight losses due to carbonate and chromate decomposition, respectively, as a result of better recrys- tallization of the system, which occurs in air at lower temperatures [37]. 130 G.L. Castiglioni et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 3.2. Characterization of the oxide catalysts For each calcination temperature, the oxide phases identified in the XRD patterns, by comparison with the JCPDS Powder Diffraction Files [39], are reported in Table 1, together with the amounts of CuO calculated on the basis of XRD data [40], the theoretical CuO content, the lattice parameters of the spinel phases and the surface areas of the mixed oxides obtained at 653 K. After calcination at 653 K for 24 h, the catalyst with the highest amount of chromium (Cat 1 ) showed the presence of tetragonal CuCr204 spinel and Cr203. Even though the chemical composition of the sample would also require the occur- rence of CuO, no trace of tenorite is detected by XRD analysis. At a higher copper content (Cat 2), poorly crystalline cubic CuCr204 spinel (mainly) and CuO are observed. The partial substitution of Cu2+ ions with Zn2+ ions (Cat 3) again gives rise to cubic spinel and CuO, while that of Cu2+ ions with Cd2+ ions (Cat 4) leads to cubic spinel, CuO and a-CdCrO4. The presence of a chromate species, CuCrO4, is also detected in Cat 1 calcined at 593 K, while no evidence of CuCrzO4 spinel is found after this treatment, notwithstanding the right Cu/Cr stoichiometric ratio. Taking into account that amorphous dichromate-type phases are detected by IR analysis [41 ] also in Cat 2 and 3 calcined at lower temperatures [23], a general mechanism of formation of spinel phases through chromate intermediates (more or less crystalline) and their successive autocatalytic decomposition may be sug- gested [ 9,42]. It is worth noting that also for the chromium-rich sample Cat 1 (Cu/ Cr=33:67), the formation of tetragonal CuCr204 spinel takes place via intermediate CuCrO4, according to the following pathway: Precipitate ---* CuCrO4 + Cr203 2CuCrO4 --~ CuCr204(tetragonal) + CuO + 3/202 CuO + Cr203 ~ CuCr204(tetragonal) In order to avoid the formation of intermediate CuCrO4, calcination at 653 K of the Cu/Cr= 33:67 precipitate must be carried out at low oxygen pressure (ca. 66 Pa), as for Cat 5, for which only highly crystalline CuCr204 tetragonal spinel was obtained (Table 1 ). Furthermore, the heating conditions as well as the partial substitution of Cue + ions with other divalent ions have a considerable effect on the surface area of the samples obtained at 653 K. When calcination is carried out up to 753 K, the sample with the highest chro- mium content (Cat 1 ) shows the presence of more crystalline tetragonal CuCrzO4, while some Cr203 is still visible. The Cr/Cu sample with higher copper content (Cat 2) gives rise to an increase in the amount of the CuO side phase, with the appearance of the tetragonal spinel phase, in addition to the cubic one already observed at 653 K.

Therefore, cubic spinel-type phases may be obtained by controlled oxidation of the precipitates with high copper content. For the catalysts 2-4 calcined at 753 K, the amounts of CuO detected by quan- titative XRD analysis approach a maximum of ca. 50% of the value calculated on the basis of a phase composition CuO + stoichiometric spinel, showing the existence of a consistent fraction of copper ions which escapes XRD detection, probably present inside the spinel-type phase or as small CuO particles strongly interacting with it [43]. It may be noted that the values of the unit cell parameter observed for the cubic spinel (Table 1) present in Cat 4 calcined at 753 K (0.8432 nm) and in Cat 4 heated at 753 K in vacuum (0.8552 nm) are intermediate between the values given for cubic CuCr204, 0.8344 nm, and cubic CdCr204, 0.8596 nm [39]. The unit cell expansion observed in the spinel of Cat 4 in comparison to pure CuCr204 indicates the presence of a Cu-Cd spinet-type solid solution, in agreement with the expec- tations based on the isomorphous replacement in CuCr204 of a smaller ion (tetra- hedral ionic radius for Cu2+ equal to 0.57 A) with a larger one (tetrahedral ionic radius for Cd2 + equal to 0.78 ,~) [ 44]. On the basis of the values for CuCrzO4 and CdCr204 as extreme members and hypothesizing that the Cu/Cd spinel type solid solutions obey Vegard's law [45], the following results were obtained (Fig. 2): -- For Cat 4 calcined at 753 K, a Cd/Cd + Cu atomic ratio of about 38%, in agreement with the value of ca. 31%, calculated from the quantitative composition determined by XRD analysis (Table 1 ). -- For Cat 4 heated at 753 K in vacuum, a Cd/Cd + Cu atomic ratio of about 80%, in agreement with the value of ca. 85% calculated from the quantitative composition determined by XRD analysis. It should be noted that the formation of a spinel solid solution is also likely to occur in Cat 3 since Cuz+ and Zn2+ ions have more comparable sizes than Cu2+ 132 G.L. Castiglioni et al. /Applied Ccltalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123 144 and Cd2+ ions (tetrahedral ionic radii for Cu2+ and Zn2+ equal to 0.57 and 0.60 A, respectively) [44]. However, due to the similarity of the ionic radii for Cu2+ and Zn2+, which is reflected in the similar lattice parameters observed for cubic CuCrzO4 (0.8344 rim) and ZnCr204 (0.8328 rim) [39], the experimental value of the lattice parameter for the cubic spinel in Cat 3 (0.833 nm) cannot lead to any conclusion regarding the presence of a mixed Cu-Zn-Cr spinel. It should also be noted that Cat 4 heated at 753 K in vacuum gives rise to CdO and CuCrO2 (Cu + containing compound), in addition to the Cu-Cd cubic spinel solid solution mentioned above. For Cat 2, a further increase in calcination temperature (853 K) leads to an increase in the amount of both segregated CuO and tetragonal spinel phase only (Table 1 ), suggesting that the cubic structure represents an intermediate step in the formation of the more stable tetragonal phase, according to the following scheme: Precipitate ~ Chromate-type phase ~ Cubic spinel-type phase ~ Tetragonal spinel-type phase In any case, the nature of the elements present in the systems plays an important part in this process, and it is possible to define the following order of stability for the cubic spinel structure: Cu/Zn/Cr > Cu/Cd/Cr > Cu/Cr. 3.3. Reduction of the catalysts The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) curves up to 513 K for the various catalysts calcined at 653 K are shown in Fig. 3, while the amounts of hydrogen uptake are reported in Table 2 (it is worth noting that the amounts of water formed agree with the hydrogen uptake). A sample of pure Cr203, studied as a reference compound, was not reduced at T< 873 K. For Cat 5 (pure, tetragonal and highly crystalline CtlCrzO4 spinel) a single peak was detected (with a maximum at 408 K) related to the reduction of the copper present in the spinel phase. However, the hydrogen uptake at the end of the TPR test ( 513 K) corresponded to ( slightly less than) 50% of the copper content in the copper chromite used (Table 2), showing that the Cu2+ ions were only partially reduced. The XRD analysis, made soon after the TPR tests, confirmed the total absence of metallic copper and indicated the presence of CuCrO2 together with unreduced CuCrzO4, while the XRD pattern after heating at 773 K in dynamic vacuum of the sample previously reduced at 513 K, showed a better crystallization of the CuCrO2 phase formed. It may be recalled that the formation of CuCrO2 has already been reported in Cu-Cr oxide samples by Tonner et al. [46]. Another interesting feature, only evident in the TPR curve of Cat 5 (Fig. 3), is that the base line for this catalyst is shifted to the hydrogen consumption side after the reduction peak. This is an indication that reduction was still going on. The TPR experiment on Cat 5 was repeated up to 873 K and the following results were found (Fig. 4): G.L.

The XRD pattern taken after reduction at 603 K showed the presence of CuCrO2. If we recall that, originally, Cat 5 is a highly crystalline (large particles) tetragonal CuCr204 spinel and that after reduction at 513 K, CuCr204 was still found in the XRD pattern, it may be reasonably assumed that the sharp peak is due to the reduction of the spinel surface layers, and the successive shoulder to the reduction of the bulk spinel, both processes giving rise to CuCrO> (ii) The second part of the reduction gives a large region in the range 603-823 K (the integrated area corresponds to 50% of molar copper reduction), and is reasonably related to the successive reduction of the Cu+ ions present in CuCrO2 to metallic copper. The XRD pattern at the end of reduction (873 K) confirms the presence of only Cu+ Cr203. The XRD carried out during the in situ reduction confirmed that Cat 5 is difficult to reduce. The following features regarding the reduction of the bulk structure of the solid emerge from the data reported in Fig. 5 (only the most relevant temper- atures are shown): (i) at 523 K the pattern is the same as that taken at room temperature and tetragonal CuCr204 is the only phase present; (ii) the initial point of disappearance of the spinel phase occurs much later than for the other samples G.L. Castiglioni et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 135 (583 K) ; (iii) only at 613 K can the appearance of Cube detected (note the shift towards higher 20 values of the X-ray line at ca. 43; and (iv) the sample is completely reduced only at 673 K with the formation of cubic Cr203 [39], and metallic copper with a low degree of crystallinity (in the other catalysts the CuX- ray line at 20 = 43is much stronger and narrower than here). Another interesting feature is shown by the TPR curve of Cat 1 (Fig. 3). We may recall that in this sample, despite the stoichiometry corresponding to CuCr204 (as Cat 5), only tetragonal CuCr204 and Cr203 (both phases with a low degree of crystallinity) were found by XRD analysis. The detection of Cr203 by XRD, but not of a corresponding amount of CuO, may be the result, as also suggested by Laine et al. [47], of some amount of non-crystalline copper, e.g. well dispersed or occupying defect sites in the spinel phase. In situ reduction XRD analysis carried out on Cat 1 showed that: (i) the first evidence of Cuformation is detected at 523 K; and (ii) the tetragonal CuCr204 spinel is completely reduced at 573 K with the formation of hexagonal T-Cr203 and Cu(with a low degree of crystallinity). Therefore, the first TPR peak is due to the reduction to metallic copper of the non- crystalline copper (finely dispersed CuO or Cu2 + ions located at some point defects in the spinel), and the second peak to the reduction of CuCrzO4 [ 47-49]. However, in contrast to that found for Cat 5, the reduction of the spinel phase occurs com- pletely to Cu(without the intermediate formation of CuCrO2), with good agree- ment between the values of observed and calculated hydrogen uptake (Table 2). We can thus infer that in Cat 1 considerable interaction exists between the CuO and CuCr204 particles, and that reduction of the spinel is strongly catalyzed by the metallic copper formed by reduction of CuO. However, CuCr204 also promotes, even though to a lesser extent, the CuO reducibility, taking into account that complete reduction of CuO alone was observed to occur under the same experi- mental conditions at least 40 K later [50]. Confirmation of the synergetic promoter catalytic effect of metallic copper and CuCr204 on the CuCr204 and CuO reducibility, respectively, is also obtained from the TPR experiment on Cat 2 (where the CuO content is higher than in Cat 1 ). In situ reduction XRD analysis confirmed that the initial disappearance of the cubic CuCr204 spinel phase and formation of metallic copper occur at a lower temperature (473 K) for Cat 2 than for Cat 1. The end of the reduction occurs at 493 K, with the formation of cubic Cr203 and metallic copper with a high degree of crystallinity. For Cat 3, where in comparison with Cat 2 there is a partial substitution of copper ions with zinc ions and where the phases present are CuO and cubic chromite (Table 1), the TPR experiment shows the occurrence of a first peak with two successive shoulders. By analogy to Cat 2, the first peak and the first shoulder are related to the reduction to Cuof the copper in CuO and CuCrzO4, respectively. The second shoulder may be attributed to the reduction of Cu2+ in a mixed copper- zinc spinel-type phase, which although not directly detectable by XRD, can rea- sonably be considered to be present in this sample, in analogy with that observed for Cat 4. Based on the observed reduction temperature, it seems, moreover, that 136 G.L. Castiglioni et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123 144 cY ~~~ 533 K A i'' ...... 2e/degrees Fig. 6. XRD patterns for Cat 4 (Cu/Cd/Cr - 40:10:50, atomic ratio percent, calcined at 653 K for 24 h ) subjected to in situ reduction (HJN2 = 6/94 v/v) at different temperatures.

Asterisk, double asterisk, T and Cuindicate the X-ray lines of Pt internal reference~ Cr203, CuO (tenorite) and Cu respectively. zinc plays a promoter role toward copper reducibility. In situ reduction XRD analysis confirmed that the initial disappearance of the spinel phase and the for- mation of metallic copper occur for Cat 3 at a slightly lower temperature (463 K), than for Cat 2 (473 K, Table 2). Interpretation of the TPR curves of Cat 4 is not easy, but the most probable hypothesis is that the higher reduction temperatures (in comparison with those observed for Cat 2 and 3) indicate the presence of cadmium chromate and of a copper-cadmium mixed spinel-type phase as inhibitors toward the copper reduci- bility of both CuO and copper chromite. The peak with a maximum at 423 K may be assigned to the simultaneous reduction of CuO and Cr6 + (of the chromate) to Cr3 +. The second peak with a maximum at 431 K is attributable to the complete reduction to metallic copper of Cu2+ in the chromite phase. This hypothesis is confirmed by the XRD in situ reduction analysis. For Cat 4, where the oxide products present are CuO, Cu/CdCr204 and o~-CdCrO4, the first evidence of metal- lic copper is observed at 503 K (Fig. 6). 3.4. Catalytic activiO, The activity of the catalysts obtained by reduction of the samples calcined at 653 K was investigated in the MA and GBL hydrogenation reactions; in the former case G.L Castiglioni et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 137 the feedstock was a MA/GBL solution (60:40 w/w). In these tests the H2/C4 molar ratio in the feedstock must be optimized to avoid saturation and/or deacti- vation phenomena. In this regard, a value of about 100 (mol/mol) is generally claimed in the patent literature as the minimum ratio for the hydrogenation of MA or its esters [51-54]; therefore the catalytic behaviours were studied using two ratios above and below this value, obtained by maintaining the hydrogen flow constant and increasing the organic feedstock. It must be noted that, with the MA/ GBL solution as the feedstock, a yield in GBL of 43% corresponds to the amount introduced as solvent. For all the samples investigated the tests carried out at T < 473 K showed mainly surface adsorption and/or condensation phenomena, while at T> 573 K hydrogenolysis and cracking predominated. In the tests carried out using GBL as feedstock and the higher H2/GBL molar ratio, the Cu/Cr catalysts (Cat 1 and Cat 2) showed similar behaviours, with a small increase in activity as a function of the copper content (Table 3A). At the lower temperatures investigated, the main products are tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-butanol (owing to the overhydrogenation reaction), while at 548 K the formation of significant amounts of ethanol was observed, evidence of considerable hydro- genolysis activity. The formation of ethanol was favoured at the higher copper content. The complement of the yield data of Table 3, as well as those of Table 4, has to be attributed both to light products (mainly hydrocarbons) and to irreversible surface adsorption with tar formation. The partial substitution of copper ions with zinc (Cat 3) or, especially, with cadmium ions (Cat 4) gives rise to a decrease in GBL conversion. In particular, while zinc is responsible only for small differences, with cadmium a considerable deactivation of the catalyst is observed. The decrease in catalytic activity observed for the zinc containing sample is in contrast with the data relative to the hydrogen- ation of crude oxoaldehydes previously reported [22], evidencing a direct rela- tionship between optimum catalyst composition and organic feedstock. In any case, it is possible to establish, as a function of the divalent ions present, the following order of activity toward GBL: Cu > Cu/Zn >> Cu/Cd. To evidence the role of the free copper in GBL hydrogenation, the activity of Cat 5 was also studied. This catalyst has the same atomic composition as Cat 1, but was obtained by heating under reduced air pressure. For Cat 5 only tetragonal CuCr204 was detected by XRD analysis, while for Cat 1 Cr203 was also found, thus suggesting, on the basis of the stoichiometry, the presence of a fraction of CuO which escapes XRD detection (Table 1 ). It can be seen from Table 3, part A that for Cat 5 the GBL conversion is much lower than for Cat 1 and Cat 2, on account of the lack of free copper in this sample; however, it is noteworthy that this sample is not fully inactive in the reaction examined. Therefore, the free copper obtained from CuO is not the only phase responsible for hydrogenation of the GBL, but rather the copper fraction obtained by reduction of tetragonal CuCr204 also takes part in the catalytic reaction, although with lower activity. Comparing the yields in the different products for Cat 1 and Cat 5, decreases in THF, n-butanol and ethanol 138 G.L.

As the HJGBL molar ratio in the feedstock decreased, a significant decrease in the GBL conversion was observed for all samples, mainly attributable to surface saturation, as evidenced also by the greater lack in the carbon balance (Table 3, part B). The trends as a function of the catalyst composition are similar to those discussed above; however, it is worth noting that at the lower Hz/GBL molar ratio, G.L.

In the tests carried out using the MA/GBL solution and the higher H2/C4 molar ratio (Table 4, part A), the catalytic behaviours of the Cu/Cr systems (Cat 1 and Cat 2) are similar, as also observed for GBL, and depend on the copper content. It must be noted that GBL is only up to 518 K the main product, whereas succinic anhydride (SA) is present for both the catalysts at almost all temperatures. There- 140 G.L. Castiglioni et al. /Applied Comlysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 fore, for these systems the limiting step for the GBL production is the hydrogenation of SA to GBL, which, in turn, may rapidly form other products. The increase in temperature gives rise to a higher conversion of SA and also an increase in the hydrogenation or overhydrogenation of the GBL to THF and n-butanol, respec- tively, as well as the hydrogenolysis reaction to ethanol and acetone. The presence of the second divalent element strongly modifies the catalytic behaviour, in particular, the partial substitution of copper ions with zinc ions (Cat 3) is responsible for an increase in the hydrogenation activity towards SA which gives rise to an increase in the yield in GBL. Cat 3 does not show remarkable differences at 548 K in comparison with Cu/Cr catalysts, although this system produces higher amounts of Cr-C2 alcohols and butyric acid. Therefore, zinc increases the rate of the limited step, but does not inhibit the overhydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis of GBL. Partial substitution of cadmium ions for copper ions ( Cat 4), as previously shown with GBL, gives rise to an almost complete disappearance of the catalytic activity, giving rise to SA only. This system is the only catalyst tested in which residual amounts of MA are detected at all the temperatures investigated together with a consumption of GBL. The increase in the yield in SA observed for this catalyst only by increasing the temperature, can be mainly attributed to the desorption of organic compounds adsorbed during the previous tests at 485 K. Finally, this catalyst presents the greatest lack in the carbon balance, due to highly irreversible surface adsorption phenomena. In comparison to Cat 1, the catalyst containing only CuCr204 (Cat 5) shows an increase in the yield in GBL, mainly attributable to the decrease in the reactions involving GBL with formation of THF, n-butanol and hydrogenolysis products. On the other hands, it is difficult to rationalize the differences in SA yields, which depend considerably on reaction temperature. Therefore, on the basis of these data, it may be hypothesized that the free copper obtained by reduction of CuO is responsible for the overhydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis reactions of GBL, while the selective hydrogenation of the MA to GBL seems to involve mainly the copper fraction obtained by reduction of chromite-type phases. With decreasing H2/C4 molar ratio the maximum yield in GBL increases for all catalysts (Table 4, part B), the maximum however, takes place at temperatures higher than those detected for the higher H2/C4 molar ratio. The yield in SA does not seem to be strongly influenced by the temperature and the high values observed for Cat 2 and Cat 5 at 548 K may again be attributed to desorption phenomena. Also under these conditions the partial substitution of copper ions with a second divalent ion strongly modifies the catalytic behaviour, although no significant differences in the trends were detected in comparison to the behaviour discussed above for the higher H2/C4 molar ratio. In particular, zinc ions achieve greater amounts of GBL (especially at 518 K), whereas cadmium ions almost completely deactivate the catalyst, with a further decrease in MA conversion. G.L. Castiglioni et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 141 It is worth noting that also at lower H2/C4 molar ratio, Cat 5, in which no free copper (i.e. obtained by reduction of CuO) is present, exhibits the best yield in GBL, although at 548 K instead of 518 K, in agreement with the decrease in activity previously discussed. Therefore, once again the absence of free copper seems to have a positive effect in the vapour phase hydrogenation of MA to GBL. Finally, XRD analysis carried out after reaction and following passivation by nitrous oxide, shows for all the samples the presence of a poorly crystalline spinel- type phase together with well crystallized metallic copper, in agreement with only surface oxidation of the particles by nitrous oxide [ 29,30]. However, no significant differences were observed in comparison to the XRD patterns obtained by reduction at the same temperature. Furthermore, no direct relationship was found between the copper surface area (Table 2) and the catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of both GBL and MA/GBL solution (Tables 3 and 4); for example, Cat 1 showed the highest copper surface area, while Cat 2 was the most active in GBL hydrogen- ation. The very low value detected for Cat 4, the catalyst which also showed the lowest hydrogenation capacity towards both the feedstocks investigated, should be noted. 4. Conclusions Tetragonal CuCr204 spinel can be obtained directly by heating the stoichiometric precipitate (Cu/Cr= 33:67, atomic ratio percent) at low oxygen pressure; while in calcination the spinel forms via intermediate CuCrO4. Furthermore, with increas- ing copper content (Cu/Cr = 50:50, atomic ratio percent), the chromate decom- position gives rise at first to a cubic spinel-type phase, which then transforms to the tetragonal form as temperature is further increased, with a corresponding increase in the amount of CuO detected by XRD analysis. The partial substitution of copper ions with zinc or cadmium ions stabilizes the cubic spinel-type phase, which contains both copper and other divalent cations, as evidenced by XRD data of Cu/Cd/Cr ternary samples heated at 753 K in different conditions. Cubic Cu/Cr spinel is more reducible than the tetragonal form, which, furthermore, reduced to metallic copper through the intermediate formation of CuCrOz. Zinc exerts a promoting effect on the copper reducibility, that takes place at lower temperatures, while cadmium acts as an inhibitor, displacing the reduction towards high temperatures. The presence of free metallic copper (obtained by reduction of CuO) and its amount in the catalyst strongly determine the hydrogenation activity towards GBL, although the copper fraction obtained by reduction of tetragonal CuCr204 also shows a lower activity. However, no direct relationship was observed between catalytic activity and copper surface area. The partial substitution of copper ions with zinc ions gives rise to a small decrease in activity, while that with cadmium ions almost completely deactivates the catalyst. 142 G.L. Casti,glioni et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 123 (1995) 123-144 It is worth noting that the Cd-containing catalyst (Cat 4) shows a very low copper surface area, which cannot be justified simply on the basis of differences in crys- tallite size in comparison to the other samples. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that during the activation and/or reaction, a partial reduction of cadmium ions also takes place, with formation of copper-rich alloys at the surface of the particles. The presence of a small amount of metallic cadmium does not modify the XRD powder pattern of the copper particles, but may have a considerable influence on their physicochemical or catalytic properties [56-58]. However, it is worth noting that no direct evidence of the presence of these surface copper-rich alloys was observed during this study, on account also of the techniques employed. Therefore, this hypothesis has to be confirmed by further investigations using surface analysis techniques. On the other hand, in the catalytic tests with MA/GBL solution, the presence of free copper has a negative effect, favouring the hydrogenation of GBL to THF or, mainly, overhydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions at the higher tempera- tures. In fact, comparing the different Cu/Cr catalysts (Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 5), the best yields in GBL, independently from the H2/C4 molar ratio, were obtained with Cat 5, in which only the copper fraction obtained by reduction of tetragonal CuCr204 is present. For this catalyst a very low tendency to overhydrogenation or hydrogenolysis reactions is observed at both the H2/C4 molar ratios investigated (Table 4). Furthermore, the important role of the spinel and/or spinel-type phases is con- firmed by the catalytic behaviour of the samples in which part of the copper ions was substituted by zinc or cadmium ions (Cat 3 and Cat 4). Also in this case, the presence of cadmium ions (Cat 4) gives rise to a considerable deactivation, similar to that previously discussed for the test with GBL, while the presence of zinc ions gives rise to a small increase in the yield in GBL, by favouring the hydrogenation of SA. However, it must be pointed out that this catalyst also exhibits at the higher temperatures high overhydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities, probably on account of the presence of free copper. Therefore, a knowledge of the mechanism of formation of the chromite catalysts appears to be very important in order to understand the structural relationships between composition, precipitation and heating conditions. In this way it will be possible to define a general preparation method, by changing the heating atmosphere and/or a partial substitution of the copper ions with appropriate divalent ions, to synthesize catalysts with specific activity and selectivity, as a function also of the organic feedstock investigated.

Different mixed oxides containing Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr were obtained by heating hydroxycarbonate precursors at various temperatures and in different atmospheres, and characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and BET and copper surface area analysis. The reduction process and the phase evolution during reduction of the mixed oxides was followed by temperature-programmed reduction and XRD. The mixed oxides were activated in an H2/N2 flow and then tested as catalysts in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and a solution of maleic anhydride (MA) in GBL (60:40 w/w). Depending on composition, heating temperature and atmosphere, the samples contained different phases, such as CuO, CdO, Cr2O3, CuCrO2, CuCrO4, α-CdCrO4, cubic and tetragonal CuCr2O4, and cubic CuZn and CuCd spinel-type phases. The partial substitution of Cu2+ ions with Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions stabilizes the cubic form of the spinel-type phases, which form via intermediate chromate phases. The final product of reduction in all cases is metallic copper. Cubic CuCr2O4 is more reducible than the corresponding tetragonal phase, which reduces to metallic copper through the intermediate formation of CuCrO2. The presence of zinc or cadmium promotes or inhibits, respectively, the copper reducibility both in CuO and in the copper chromite spinel. In the hydrogenation of GBL, the Cu/Cr catalysts obtained by calcination show similar behaviours, with a small increase in activity as a function of the copper content. At the lower temperatures investigated the main products are tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-butanol, while at 548 K significant amounts of ethanol are observed, favoured by increasing copper content. On the other hand, the Cu/Cr catalyst obtained by heating under a reduced oxygen atmosphere, for which only tetragonal CuCr2O4 is detected before reduction, shows a decrease in catalytic activity. Partial substitution of the Cu2+ ions gives rise to a decrease in GBL conversion, with a considerable deactivation when Cd2+ ions are present. Decreasing the H2/C4 molar ratio gives rise to a decrease in activity for all samples, without any significant change in the trend observed. With the MA/GBL solution, the partial substitution of Cd2+ ions for Cu2+ ions also gives rise to considerable deactivation. For the other catalysts, the main products at the lower temperatures are GBL and succinic anhydride (SA), while at 548 K overhydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions predominate. The presence of Zn2+ ions gives rise to an increase in yield in GBL, due to an increase in the hydrogenation activity toward SA, but the consecutive transformation of GBL at high temperature to low cost by-products is not inhibited. On the other hand, the presence in the Cu/Cr catalyst of only CuCr2O4 increases the yield in GBL, as a consequence of a strong inhibition of the overhydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis reactions of GBL. With the MA/GBL solution, similar behaviours are observed when the H2/C4 molar ratio decreases. At the same time, however, the lack in the carbon balance increases and a displacement towards high temperature of the maximum yield in GBL is found.
