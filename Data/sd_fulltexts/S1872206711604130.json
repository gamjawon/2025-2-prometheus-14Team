DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(11)60413-0 Ammonia Synthesis over Ruthenium Catalysts Using Barium-Doped Zirconia as Supports Prepared by Citric Acid Method LIN Jianxin*, WANG Ziqing, ZHANG Liuming, NI Jun, WANG Rong, WEI Kemei National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, China Abstract: Barium-promoted zirconia (Ba-ZrO 2 ) was synthesized by the citric acid method and used as supports for Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 catalysts, which were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with K 2 RuO 4 as precursor. The obtained Ba-ZrO 2 and catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction and CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption. The effect of Ba content on the structure and catalytic activity of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 catalysts is discussed. The formation of BaZrO 3 can improve significantly the catalytic activity of Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 for ammonia synthesis. The ammonia concentration and rate of ammonia synthesis of the K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 catalyst (molar ratio of Ba:Zr is 1:1) were 9.24% and 29.77 mmol/(gÂ·h), respectively, at 425 Â°C, 5.0 MPa, and 10000 h â€“1 . Improvements in electron conductivity and the basic nature of the catalyst may be the main reasons for such high catalytic activity in ammonia synthesis. Key words: barium; zirconia; ruthenium; ammonia synthesis; electronic conductivity Ru-based catalysts are considered to be second-generation catalysts for ammonia synthesis since they exhibit remarkably high activity compared to conventional Fe-based catalysts, especially at low temperature and pressure. Carbon-supported Ru catalysts have been used for industrial ammonia synthesis since the 1990s [1,2]. To overcome the significant drawback of using activated carbon supports which are prone to methana- tion under the temperatures and pressures required for ammo- nia synthesis, many stable metal oxides, such as MgO, Al 2 O 3 [3â€“5], rare earth oxides and their mixture compounds [6,7] were studied with the aim of preparing a Ru-based catalyst with high activity. ZrO 2 is a versatile material and is the only metal oxide which can act as both acid and base, oxidant or reductant [8]. It has been used widely as a catalyst and catalyst support. Unfortunately, there are few reports involving the application of ZrO 2 in ammonia synthesis or decomposition, owing to its acidity [9]. With the development of research into the prepa- ration of nanoparticles, the application of modified ZrO 2 has been reported widely [10,11]. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report on the barium-modified ZrO 2 as the support for the Ru-based catalyst for ammonia synthesis. A series of barium-modified ZrO 2 materials were prepared by combustion of the citrate sol-gel process. First, a certain amount of analytical-grade Zr(NO 3 ) 4 Â·5H 2 O and Ba(NO 3 ) 2 was dissolved in deionized water to form a transparent mixed ni- trate solution. The citric acid monohydrate was dissolved in diethylene glycol under continuous stirring at the molar ratio of 1:3. The citric acid solution was added slowly to the mixed nitrate solution and a transparent solution resulted. The solu- tion was then evaporated using a water bath at 90 Â°C to pro- mote gelation until a yellow gel was obtained. The gel was maintained at 300 Â°C for 3 h to obtain the precursor and then calcined at 780 Â°C for 5 h. The resultant white power was denoted Ba-ZrO 2 -X, where X is the molar ratio of Ba to Zr. Ruthenium catalysts were prepared by impregnating the sup- ports directly with K 2 RuO 4 solution. After reduction with ethyl alcohol, they were dried under the infrared lamp for 4 h. The samples with 4 wt% Ru were labeled as K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -X. The catalyst activity for ammonia synthesis was measured in a stainless steel reactor. Before testing, the catalysts were ac- LIN Jianxin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1075â€“1079 tivated in a flowing gas mixture of 75% H 2 and 25% N 2 from ambient temperature to 475 Â°C at 1 Â°C/min (maintained at 200, 300, 450, and 475 Â°C for 2 h each) and then stabilized at the reaction conditions (i.e. 5 MPa, 400 Â°C, 10000 h Ã­1 , and H 2 :N 2 volume ratio of 3) for more than 2 h. The ammonia concentra- tion in the effluent was determined by a chemical titration method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on an Analytical Xâ€™Pert Pro diffractometer system, using Co K a radiation (0.1789 nm). CO 2 temperature-programmed desorp- tion (CO 2 -TPD) was determined according to Ref. [5] (all samples weighed 60 mg). The catalytic activity of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -X is given in Table 1. The catalytic activity of the K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 catalysts in- creased with increasing Ba content up to a certain value and then decreased with further Ba loading. K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -1.0 showed the highest activity while the highest ammonia con- centration and maximum ammonia synthesis rates were 9.24% and 29.77 mmol/(gÂ·h), respectively, at 5 MPa, 425 Â°C, and 10000 h â€“1 . This activity was much higher than the other cata- lysts with more or less Ba content and than other previously reported catalysts (such as Ru/Sm-Al 2 O 3 [3â€“5], Ru/La 2 O 3 [6], Ru/Sm 2 O 3 [7], Ba-Ru/NB [12]), although the latter catalystsâ€™ activity was measured at high pressure (10 MPa, 10000 h â€“1 ). The XRD patterns of the Ba-ZrO 2 -X composites with dif- ferent Ba:Zr molar ratios are shown in Fig. 1. One can see that Ba-ZrO 2 -0.10 and Ba-ZrO 2 -0.50 show clear peaks attributable to ZrO 2 and barium zirconate (BaZrO 3 ). The formation of orthorhombic barium carbonates is only observed for Ba-ZrO 2 -1.2. BaZrO 3 with ideal perovskite structure is an alkaline material and solid-electrolyte with abundant oxygen vacancies, which exhibit high proton and electronic conduc- tivity [13,14]. Many papers have proven that the effectiveness of a support for ammonia synthesis is related approximately to the basic nature and electrical conductivity of the compound [15â€“18]. The presence of BaZrO 3 on the ZrO 2 surface could therefore promote the electrical conductivity of the supports and transmit the electrons of K promoters to the Ru surface directly, thereby increasing the Ru catalyst activity signifi- cantly. However, the presence of BaCO 3 in the Ba-ZrO 2 -1.2 would decrease the electrical conductivity and may be the main reason for the poor performance of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -1.2. Many papers have proven that the strong basicity of support materials is conductive to the activity of Ru-based catalysts for ammonia synthesis and that the stronger the support basicity, the higher the catalytic performance [15,19,20]. CO 2 -TPD was carried out to measure the amount and strength of the basic sites on the catalyst surface and the results are shown in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the CO 2 -TPD of all the samples contained two partially separated desorption peaks, indicating that a variety of basic sites with different strengths were present on the surface. The peak appearing at 50â€“150 Â°C could be ascribed to the weak basic site, while the high temperature peak resulted from the strong basic site. The phenomenon where the basic site strength is weakened with increase in Ba content in the support is also observed. However, the number of basic sites increases, which increases the activity for ammonia synthesis. The catalytic activity of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -1.2 is lower than that of K-Ru/Ba-ZrO 2 -1.0 although the number of basic sites is in contrast, which may be responsible for the presence of BaCO 3 because the formation of BaCO 3 could cover the basic site on the surface of BaZrO 3 .

LIN Jianxin et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 1075â€“1079 In conclusion, the series of Ba-doping ZrO 2 materials pre- pared by the citric acid method supported Ru catalysts all displayed excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at low temperature and pressure. The phenomenon may result from the formation of BaZrO 3 in the supports at high tem- perature, which would increase electron conductivity and ba- sicity. Mobile electrons donated from the promoter K and BaZrO 3 itself to the Ru metal particles facilitated the cleavage of NÅ�N by the solid electrolyte support, BaZrO 3 . Further im- provements in the ammonia synthesis properties and struc- ture-effect relationship are being investigated. References 1 Niwa Y, Aika K.

The ammonia concentration and rate of ammonia synthesis of the K-Ru/Ba-ZrO2 catalyst (molar ratio of Ba: Zr is 1:1) were 9.24% and 29.77 mmol/(g·h), respectively, at 425°C, 5.0 MPa, and 10000 h−1. Improvements in electron conductivity and the basic nature of the catalyst may be the main reasons for such high catalytic activity in ammonia synthesis.",
