Boitiaux Institut Francais du Petrole, 14 Avenue O Bois Preau, 92506 Rueil Malmaison (France) (Received February 27, 1991; accepted July 9, 1991) Abstract Bimetallic catalysts were prepared using two different techniques. Ruthenium or platinum was deposited on Raney copper by oxido-reduction. Ruthenium deposited on charcoal was modified by copper by catalytic reduction. Aqueous phase polyol conversions (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, glucitol) in the range 493-533 K under 4 MPa of hydrogen show that unsaturated intermediates resulting from dehydrogenation are irreversibly adsorbed on the surface of copper-based catalysts modified or not by Ru or Pt. C-C and C-O bond cleavages observed on Raney copper occur through the nucleophilic action of adsorbed hydroxyl groups. For surface atomic ratios Ru or Pt to copper from 0-0.15, these reactions are deactivated due to the disappearance of surface hydroxyl groups. This phenomenon can be explained through the induced reduction of hydroxylated copper in the presence, at the catalyst surface, of 12-Ru or HZ-Pt electrodes that fix their potential on the total catalyst. For surface atomic ratios Ru or Pt to copper greater than 0.15, cyclodehydration reactions leading to furanic derivatives occur through an electron transfer from copper to the second metal, thus creating electrophilic copper. In the case of ruthenium modified by copper, only the more active sites of Ru responsible for the multiple hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds are poisoned, part of the copper being deposited on the charcoal support. The remaining ruthenium not interacting with copper retains a high activity for simple hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds. Introduction Previous papers have presented the main behaviour of several metals used as catalysts for aqueous phase polyol conversions between 473 K and 533 K in the presence of hydrogen. Raney copper does not catalyze hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds [11. However, it is able to hydro-dehydrogenate alcoholic functions and leads to carbonyls from which, on nucleophilic action (water or adsorbed hydroxyls), competitive reactions of C-C and C-O bonds cleavages are observed: dehydroxylation (DOH), 0304-5102/91/$3.50 0 1991- Elsevier Sequoia, Lausanne 66 retro-Claisen (RC) and retro-Michael (RM). These reaction mechanisms will be recalled later. From a practical point of view it would be of interest to favour the RM reaction over the two others in order, for instance, to increase the conversion selectivity of glucitol (sorbitol) into glycerol. Unfortunately, in the case of Raney copper, the DOH reaction is the fastest. Ruthenium deposited on charcoal [21 is a highly active catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds. Its modification by sulfur eliminates these hydrogenolyses and leads to a catalyst that acts like copper, as it catalyzes DOH, RM and retroaldolization (RA) reactions, but exhibits very good selectivity towards RM and DOH in the case of glucitol [2, 31. In order to increase the activity of copper, a number of bimetallic Cu-RU catalysts were prepared by depositing Ru on a Raney copper catalyst [4, 51. Their properties for polyol conversion were compared with those of Ru-Cu bimetals obtained by the deposit of Cu on Ru/C catalysts. Lastly, results were extended to a Cu-Pt couple. Experimental Catalysts Modified Raney copper The starting material was Raney copper prepared by leaching a copper-aluminum (50/50) alloy with 10 M sodium hydroxide solution. The metallic powder thus obtained had an area of 18 m2 g-', as measured by nitrogen adsorption and confirmed by N20 decomposition. Modifications of copper were carried out by mixing under nitrogen a newly prepared Raney copper with solutions of RUC13 or HZPtCIs of suitable concentrations (Fig. 1). Since surface oxido-reduction reactions such as: 3Cu~s) + 2Ru3+ ;=-ft 3Ca2 + (a,) + 2Ru~s) or 2Cu(g)+Pt'+(aq) r-- 2Cu2+(aq)+Ptrs) were assumed to occur [61, the modifier concentrations were adjusted to obtain the required surface atomic ratios of Ru/Cu or Pt/Cu. Details on the bimetallic catalysts prepared in this way are given in Table 1, emphasizing the relationship between metallic deposits on copper and the concentrations of the corresponding salts in solution. It was observed that RU(III) ions could only exchange one-third of the copper surface atoms, while for Pt(IV) ions total exchange was possible. Copper-modified ruthenium Conversely, modification of ruthenium-based catalysts was carried out on a 10ss'o (w/w) charcoal-supported ruthenium. This type of catalyst was selected for its stability in water at temperatures close to 500 K. The support was an activated charcoal (CECA LZS) treated with hydrogen at 1300 K to 67 TABLE 1 Influence of concentrations of metallic salts in solution on the metal deposit Catalyst qM\"` qM qcug qCue (at/at) (at/at) RU/Cu Ru3+(.q) Rue 1.5 1.5 3.7 4.8 7.5 8.0 37.3 21.0 73.9 32.0 147.8 32.0 Pt/Cu pt4' (e,u Pt. 4.9 4.2 15.0 15.0 20 25.0 50 57.1 99.6 92.1 `qM\"+/qCu,=ratio of the number of metallic ions in solution to the number of copper surface atoms. bqM/qCu,=ratio of the number of metal atoms deposited on the copper surface to the number of copper surface atoms. eliminate traces of sulfur and refunctionalized by hydrogen peroxide oxidation [7]. RUC13 was deposited by impregnation (evaporation to dryness). The catalysts were then activated under a hydrogen flow at 670 K for 10 h. The ruthenium concentration was 10'0 (w/w) and the metallic dispersion, measured by oxygen adsorption at 298 K, 40%. Addition of copper on ruthenium was carried out by catalytic reduction [8]. The previously reduced basic ruthenium catalyst, placed in the lower part of the reactor described in Fig. 1, was hydrogen retreated at 573 K for 2 h. After cooling to 323 K, a copper solution of appropriate concentration was introduced on the catalyst under hydrogen flow. Here again, copper concentration corresponded to a fraction of the ruthenium surface area, since the deposit could be represented by the total reactions: 2R%)+Hz(--> 2Ru-HAS) 2Ru-H(,,) +Cuz+(a--> Ru-Cu(g)+2H+(.,) It is noteworthy that experiments on charcoal alone without ruthenium did not allow copper reduction at a significant rate. Three catalysts were prepared in this way: Cu/Ru 0.25; 0.50; 1.00. STEM observations showed that isolated copper aggregates could be found on the support, probably because of hydrogen spillover or electrochemical reduction, ss 1 A : addition tunnel C : catalyst I= : oven G : gas outlet I : gas inlet R : reactor T : thermocouple U : union V : 2 or 3 way teflon tap V Fig. 1. Reactor for catalyst modification. given that Ru particles in the presence of hydrogen were able to take the reversible electrochemical potential corresponding to HZ 4;~ 2H+ + 2e. Since the support is a conductor, it takes the same electrochemical potential, and at this potential direct reduction of Cu\" ions can occur. But it was also evident that the major part of the copper was in interaction with the ruthenium, which was confirmed by the poison effect showed in Fig. 7 and discussed later. Reactions The detailed procedures were reported previously [1]. The reactor was a 300 ml autoclave. Concentrations of the aqueous polyol solutions were: 0.44 M glycerol, 0.33 M erythritol, 0.22 M xylitol and 0.11 M glucitol; partial hydrogen pressure was 4 MPa and temperatures 493 or 533 K except when otherwise specified. Analyses of liquid samples were performed by HPLC on Bio-Rad columns: HPX 87H (323 K, 0.9 ml min-1 HZSO4 0.013 N) or HPX 87C (353 K, 0.6 ml min-1 H20). 69 Product identification Coupling gas phase chromatography-mass spectrometry Water contained in the reaction mixture at the end of an experiment was removed with a rotatory evaporator and then peracetylated using a mixture of acetic anhydride-pyridine in excess. The isolated peracetate mixture was dissolved in acetone. Analyses were performed by gas chromatography (Sigma 3 Perkin Elmer, CPSil 5 column, 393-453 K, 2 K min-I) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Kratos MS25) fitted with a chemical ionisation (NH3) system. Molecular weights of peracetates could thus be obtained. Structure determination and quantitative analysis '3C NMR of simple sugars, alditols and anhydroalditols are well known [9-121. We could record spectra even after water evaporation from the reaction mixtures and dissolution of the residue in deuterium oxide or directly by adding deuterium oxide to the reaction mixture. We used acetone as an internal reference (8 = 30.6 ppm from TMS). The instrument was a Bruker WP 200 SY spectrometer (200 MHz for 1H, 50 MHz for 13C). Figure 2 gives the formulas of the main substances encountered and Table 2 compares the chemical shifts observed with those reported in the literature. In the case of mixtures such as anhydro-1,4-glucitol, 2,5-mannitol, 2,5iditol and isosorbide, quantitative analyses were computed from line intensities of certain carbons (e.g. 2 and 5 carbons for isosorbide, 1 and 6 carbons for anhydro-2,5-mannitol and iditol). Bock and coworkers [9] showed that this method was accurate at 2.5%. Preparation of anhydroalditols Mixtures obtained after several experiments carried out at 493 K and 533 K with the Ru/Cug=0.33 catalyst were subjected to water evaporation and to bulb distillation (0.1 mmHg). We could thus isolate, respectively, a mixture of monoanhydrohexitols whose composition was: 1,4-anhydro-Dglucitol 59ss'o 2,5-anhydro-L-iditol 29%, 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 12%; and pure isosorbide. These two types of products were used as standards to determine the response coefficients relative to an internal standard (1,2-butanediol) for HPLC quantitative analysis (monoanhydroalditols are poorly separated by HPLC). Pure isosorbide was also prepared as described by Bock et al. [9] by heating (443 K) under vacuum a mixture of glucitol and Amberlite IR120, then distilling under vacuum: yield 46.5ss'o (litt. 56.7ss'o), m.p. 66 C (litt. 53-59 C).

For M/Cug in the 0 to 0.10-0.15 range, the second metal is a poison of the typical reactions of copper: DOH, RC, RM (part A of the graph). For M/Cue greater than 0.10-0.15, the activity increases (part C of the graph) whereas the selectivity changes drastically: the main and practically only reaction observed is a cyclodehydration according to the scheme shown in Fig. 4. For these two types of catalysts, glucitol was converted mainly through two consecutive cyclizations first into 1,4-anhydro-D-glucitol and then into 1,4-3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol (isosorbide). During these reactions the chiral carbon configurations did not change. There was no cyclization into 3,6anhydro-D-glucitol. Two secondary products appeared: 2,5-anhydro-L-iditol, in which the configuration of the 5 carbon is reversed, and 2,5-anhydro-Dmannitol, in which the configuration of the 2 carbon is reversed. The percentages given in Fig. 4 indicate the molar composition of each product in the mixture of all anhydrohexitols (as determined by 13C NMR) TABLE 2 Chemical shifts of polyols and anhydropolyols Compounds Chemical shifts relative to TMS C-1 C-2 C-3 C-4 C-5 C-6 1 erythritol 66.20 75.30 75.30 66.20 2 1,4-anhydroerythritol * 71.8 71.2 71.2 71.8 71.5 71.0 71.0 71.5 3 1,4-anhydrothreitol 73.0 76.4 76.4 73.0 4 xylitol 65.90 75.20 73.90 75.20 65.90 5 1,4-D,Iranhydroxylitol * 72.9 76.9 76.5 81.0 60.2 72.8 76.8 76.4 81.0 60.0 6 D-glucitol a 65.8 74.5 72.9 74.5 76.1 65.8 7 1,4-anhydro-D-glucitol * 73.6 76.6 76.2 80.1 69.5 63.9 74.3 77.3 76.8 80.8 70.3 64.5 8 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol * 61.6 82.8 76.9 76.9 82.8 61.6 61.9 83.2 77.3 77.3 83.2 61.9 9 2,5-anhydro-L-iditol * 60.4 80.6 76.9 76.9 80.6 60.4 61.0 81.3 77.6 77.6 81.3 61.0 10 1,4-3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol * 75.5 75.9 87.8 81.8 72.2 71.5 76.2 76.6 88.5 82.5 72.9 72.2 (isosorbide) 75.8 76.6 88.2 81.7 72.3 73.4 11 1,4-3,6-dianhydro-D-mannitol * 75.0 72.8 82.0 82.0 72.8 75.0 75.1 71.9 82.0 82.0 71.9 75.1 12 1,4-3,6-dianhydroiditol * 75.2 74.2 87.1 87.1 74.2 75.2 'This work in Dz0, reference acetone. `Breitmaier and Welter [12].

The total anhydrohexitol yield is 71% (as determined by HPLC), i.e. an isosorbide yield of 49% with respect to the initial glucitol. FSgure 5 A,B,C,D shows the changes in glucitol, the sum of all the monoanhydrohexitols and isosorbide vs. reaction time for the catalyst Ru/ Cu. = 0.33 at 498 and 533 K, and for the catalyst Pt/Cu. =1.0 at the same temperatures. Obviously the first cyclization is faster than the second. Table 3 gives, for the four runs cited above, the compositions of the mixtures obtained after 360 min. At 493 K, for the two catalysts, glucitol undergoes practically no other reaction than cyclodehydration. On the other hand, at 533 K products resulting from glucitol and monoanhydroglucitol degradations appear (hexanediols, ethyleneglycol, glycerol, carbon dioxide). Hydrogen is not involved in the cyclodehydration reaction scheme. A study of the effect of hydrogen pressure was carried out at partial pressures between 0 and 7.0 MPa (Table 4). An increase in hydrogen pressure had a light promoter effect on the initial rate of glucitol conversion and a more definite effect on the conversion of glucitol into anhydrohexitols. In the absence of hydrogen, cyclodehydration was accompanied by the production of large quantities of degradation products (in particular carbon dioxide in the gas phase). The kinetic order relative to glycerol, measured at three initial concentrations, was ^r 1 at 493 K (Table 5). The pH of aqueous glucitol solutions was close to 6, but decreased to ^- 3 at the end of the reaction. It is well known that cyclodehydration is a reaction catalyzed by strong acids [9]. Table 6 compares two reactions carried out at 533 K, one with 2 g of Ru/Cug = 0.33 catalyst, the other without any solid catalysts but whose initial pH was adjusted to 3 by addition of a suitable quantity of hydrochloric acid.

Indeed this catalyst is active in the hydrogenation of simple sugars. The behaviour of ruthenium-modified copper being very different from copper and ruthenium alone, it was interesting to discover whether these catalysts still had hydrodehydrogenating properties. Table 7 shows that the rate of xylose hydrogenation into xylitol (0.11 M solution, 373 K, 4 MPa hydrogen, 2 g catalyst) was increased by the ruthenium deposit, whatever the surface ratio Ru/Cus. Isosorbide iszation We have seen that glucitol conversion into isosorbide occurs with configuration retention of all chiral carbons. The same observation applies for the cyclodehydrations of erythritol and xylitol. No epimerization of the initial polyol, especially in the simple case of erythritol, was observed in the course of the reaction. This epimerization on metals is well known for polyols [ 131 and for isosorbide [ 14, 15 ] in the case of Raney nickel or nickel deposited on kieselguhr at 463-513 K under 15 MPa of hydrogen. The mechanism consists TABLE 7 Rate of xylose hydrogenation over Raney Cu and Cu-Ru catalysts Catalyst Atomic surface Hydrogenating activity ratio Ru/Cu (ml min-' g-')10\" Raney Cu 0.0 0.75 Cu-Ru(10) 0.08 1.90 Cu-Ru(100) 0.33 2.80 77 of alcohol dehydrogenation, desorption of the carbonyl thus created, readsorption of this carbonyl on one face or the other and rehydrogenation.

We were able to observe this epimerization on Raney nickel at 483 K and on Ru/Si02 at 493 K (Fig. 6). Conversely, at 493 K for the Ru/ Cus = 0.33 catalyst and at 533 K for Raney copper, no modification of isosorbide was detected after 6 h contact time. Ruthenium on charcoal modified by copper The curve in Fig. 7 shows the decrease in initial rate of glycerol conversion (0.44 M) at 483 K vs. the surface atomic ratio of the copper deposited on the catalyst to the surface ruthenium. This deactivation proves that part of the copper deposited interacts with the ruthenium. The ratio of the activity of the unmodified catalyst to that of the basic catalyst stabilizes at about 7.

Copper deposition first poisons completely the C-C and C-O multiple hydrogenolysis reactions (initial formation of methane, ethane and propane). Then, when the activity is stabilized, only simple hydrogenolysis remains: C-C (ethyleneglycol and methane: 80% of glycerol initially converted) and C-O (1,2-propanediol: 20% of glycerol initially converted). One experiment was carried out with erythritol with Cu/Rus= 1.0 (preparation ratio). No trace of cyclodehydration product was observed, and erythritol was rapidly epimerized into threitol simultaneously with hydrogenolysis reactions. Discussion Ru- and Pt-modified copper The lack of polyol isomerization on Raney copper modified or not by ruthenium or platinum - even though they may have had certain hydro-dehydrogenation properties - proves that the unsaturated species produced by dehydrogenation (aldehydes or ketones) are irreversibly adsorbed at the copper based catalyst surfaces. Notheizsz et al. [16] came to the same conclusion with experiments carried out at 448 K in the gas phase in the presence of CU/Si02 and deuterium. Methyloxirane was converted into propanal, 1-propanol and acetone which had incorporated some deuterium. Conversely, unreacted methyloxirane contained no deuterium atoms and these authors conclude that methyloxirane adsorption was irreversible on copper. Therefore, typical copper reactions (DOH, RC, RM) following the scheme below [ 1 ] occurred in the adsorbed phase: 79 Dehydroxylation (DOH): H ~ OH' _ H2 O\\ - I~ O\\ H2 C- CH- CH /C C CH - ~C- i = CH2 I I I 2 ' H2 H I 2 H OH OH OH OH OHOH I 2H2 H2 CI -.

Indeed, adsorbed dehydrogenated species may be present at all the catalyst surfaces: Ru/Cu9 = 0-0.33. DOH, RC and RM reactions are rapidly deactivated between Ru/Cus=0 and 0.15 and then are practically eliminated, whereas water used as solvent is always present. Therefore water does not play a nucleophilic role. This role is presumably played by surface hydroxyls that disappear in the presence of a noble metal such as ruthenium or platinum. There are two ways to explain this disappearance of surface hydroxyls: (a) If we assume that 1096 to 159'0 of surface copper is hydroxylated and the rest is reduced copper, the oxido-reduction carried out during the modification of Raney copper would be faster on hydroxylated than on reduced sites. However several facts seem to be inconsistent with this hypothesis. 80 Hydrogen pressure between 1.5 and 14 MPa at 513 K has no influence on the initial rate of glycerol conversion on Raney copper [ 1 ]. An increase in hydrogen pressure would decrease the surface content of hydroxylated sites in favour of the reduced copper, and therefore would have an inhibitor effect on the reaction rate. (b) If we assume that the oxido-reduction reaction occurring at room temperature in an inert atmosphere does so on uniformly hydroxylated sites, their disappearance at 493-533 K when the reactions are carried out in the presence of hydrogen may be explained by the establishment at the catalyst surface of a true hydrogen electrode (Ru or Pt-HZ). Thus, the electrochemical potential of all the catalysts is fixed by the reversible oxido-reduction reaction HZ : 2H' + 2e, inducing the reduction of copper and thus the disappearance of surface hydroxyl groups. Above a surface coverage of - 15%, ruthenium or platinum interacts with copper to create new sites capable of catalyzing the cyclodehydration reaction. It is known that this reaction is catalyzed by strongly acidic media [9, 14, 17-19 ]. Table 8 compares some results obtained with a Ru/Cus = 0.33 catalyst with those of two experiments carried out in acidic media. In this case, the mechanism starts with the protonation of hydroxyl groups, followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution produced by the oxygen of another hydroxyl group: \\c e~ \\c e~ \\c e~ / \\/ \\/ SN2 H / \\/ * ~ H2 C C -P~ H2 C C + OH 3 \\ ~C\\ Hv i + ~ ~ \\ ~ O ~ \\ Oi \\ H H H H H This SN2 reaction being easier on a primary carbon, 1,4-anhydro-Dglucitol is produced faster than 2,5-anhydro-L-iditol and D-mannitol. Only the former of these two anhydrohexitols can undergo a second but slower cyclodehydration which leads to isosorbide. The similarity of the behaviour of our catalysts and acidic catalysts led to seek electrophilic sites at the surface of Ru- or Pt-modified Raney copper. One hypothesis that would be in agreement with the promoter effect of hydrogen pressure could be the heterolytic dissociation of dihydrogen on the bimetallic catalysts: HZ ;==--t H++H- If the protons thus generated are dissociated enough to add to the alcoholic functions, the complete mechanism of acidic catalysis shown previously can be written. Even if there was initially no hydrogen, some may result from polyol dehydrogenation or from water dissociation [20, 21 ]. With such a hypothesis, we must admit that heterolytic hydrogen dissociation does not occur on Raney copper but only on bimetallic catalysts. At present we have no argument that would allow denial or confirmation of such a hypothesis. 81 TABLE 8 Comparison of results obtained by catalysis over Cu-Ru and by acidic catalysis' Products Ch-Ru H2SO4 Resin H+ 533 K 377 K 443 K A B C HO (b) HO O OH 10.1 27 0 OH 1,4-h,dlo-D-glucitd O H (b) HHO 11.6 7 4 OH 2$anhyd~Lidild H (b) N 9.2 2 3 2.5anhydro-D-manniol off (b) 0. 68.9 64 93 IAa,bai-hyd~D-gwcud (is-bid,) (c) Total yield 71 - 61 mole (%) (c) Isosorbide yield 51.0 - 56.7 mole (%) `A: 4g Cu-Ru; GCL: 0.22 M; 460 min; B: HZSO4 3M; 172 min [10]; C: Amberlite IR-120, 10 g for 29 g of glucitol; 120 min [lOJ.

The technique of modification of copper by ruthenium or platinum is based on differences between standard oxido-reduction potentials. Consequently we can assume that linkages such as M-Cu, where M=Ru or Pt, are polarized because of the different electronegativities of the elements: M-s-Cu+s This type of polarization was indicated in our laboratory by the electrochemical study of maleic acid adsorption on a copper-modified platinum electrode [22]. Similar results have been obtained using other electrochemical methods [23[. According to this hypothesis, if copper is electrophilic enough, it can adsorb water or alcohols: 82 H H 0+6 M 6.- Cu +6 + H20 ;_-=~ M s Cu R H 0+6 M 6- Cu+6 + ROH ~ M -6-Cu Therefore, if this adsorption is strong enough to weaken the corresponding C-O bond, intramolecular nucleophilic substitution is possible: ~c e/ H ~c e/ /c c~-- ~o-H + /c c~ i i \\ i +a o __~Io cu o / \\ I I Cu H M-a M -a Ruthenium on charcoal modified by copper The deposition of copper on ruthenium by the catalytic reduction process probably occurs on specific sites of this metal, i.e. those that are responsible for the multiple hydrogenolysis of C -C and C -O bonds. The process employed does not inhibit the simple hydrogenolysis of these bonds. The remaining initial activity for glycerol conversion at 483 K is 3.8 mol min-' (at Rus)-1 (taking into account all the surface ruthenium atoms of the unmodified catalyst). The activity of unmodified Raney copper for glycerol conversion at 493 K is 0.35 mol min-1 (at Cu,)-' and that of the Ru/Cug = 0.33 catalyst (selective for cyclodehydration) is 0.075 mol min-' (at Cu,)-'. The ruthenium-modified catalyst is thus - 50 times more active than the copper-modified catalyst. Even if some copper-ruthenium interaction exists on the copper-modified ruthenium catalyst, the activity for cyclodehydration of these sites would in any case be negligible compared to that of the remaining hydrogenolysis activity. Conclusion A simple oxido-reduction method can be used to deposit metals such as ruthenium or platinum on Raney copper. It leads to bimetallic catalysts in which certain properties are quite different from those of the separate metals. Unmodified copper and bimetallic Cu-Ru and Cu-Pt are hydrogenation catalysts for aldehydes but do not catalyze polyol epimerization. This is due to the irreversible adsorption of unsaturated species produced 83 by dehydrogenation. On unmodified Raney copper, adsorbed hydroxyl groups are the nucleophilic species responsible for the observed cleavages of C-C and C-O bonds. Ruthenium or platinum additives on the copper lead, under reaction conditions, to the disappearance of the adsorbed hydroxyl groups, thus eliminating the C-C and C-O bond cleavages. This is the result of the reduction of the hydroxylated copper induced by the hydrogen electrode potential composed of the hydrogen-ruthenium or hydrogen-platinum couple. The cyclodehydration reactions, leading to furanic derivatives, observed for Ru or Pt to copper atomic surface ratios > 0.15, result from an electron transfer from copper to the second metal, thus generating electrophilic copper capable of adsorbing water or alcohols. This adsorption weakens the associated C-O bond, undergoing an internal nucleophilic substitution. This mechanism is very similar to that for the acidic catalysis of these same substances. The modification of ruthenium deposited on charcoal occurs through the catalytic reduction of copper nitrate, but leads to the deposition of copper on ruthenium as well as on the support. The part of the copper interacting with ruthenium deactivates the multiple hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds, but the remaining activity of the unmodified ruthenium leads to a simple hydrogenolysis of C-C and C-O bonds much faster than that of copper, modified or not.
