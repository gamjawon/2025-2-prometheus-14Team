Raab and Johannes A. Lercher Institut fur Physikalische Chemie and Christian Doppler Laboratoraum fiir Heterogene Katalyse, Technische Universitdt Wien, Getreidemarkt 9, A-1060 Vienna (Austria) (Received August 8, 1991; revised February 19, 1992) Abstract The hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over a series of Pt/Ni catalysts was investigated. While the rate of hydrogenation to butyraldehyde was a monotonic function of the Ni concentration, the rate to crotyl alcohol was related to the concentration of the PtNi alloy. The selectivity to hydrogenation of the carbonyl group was attributed to the presence of nnl- o rf-a lnna.fk-h' rharanri Pt and nncitiuPlv rharaprl Nil 'fwn intjcnanrlPnt 72 Pt for gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Previous characterization of these bimetallic catalysts by XANES [201 suggests an electron transfer from Ni to Pt. Thus, the bimetallic system allows the study of catalytic effects of the presence of a slightly positively charged metal atom (Ni) in Pt-based catalysts. Experimental A series of silica (Si02, Aerosil 200, Degussa) supported Ni-Pt bimetallic catalysts, with a constant metal loading of 0.4 X 10-3 mol per g support and an average metal dispersion of approximately 20%, was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. The catalysts have been described in an earlier paper [ 191, in which detailed characterization data. by means of TEM, XRD, XPS, HZ chemisorption, magnetic measurements and temperature-programmed reduction are reported. The gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-buten-l-al, Aldrich, purity > 99.5'0, used without further purification) was carried out in a plug flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. Typically, between 1 and 10 mg of catalyst, corresponding to - 6 X 10 lg to 4 X 101' metal atoms, were placed between two plugs of ground quartz beads (0.2-0.8 mm diameter). Crotonaldehyde was introduced into the HZ stream by saturation of the carrier gas. Catalytic measurements were carried out between 353 and 413 K at partial pressures of 64 and 949 mbar of crotonaldehyde and hydrogen, respectively. Total reactant flow rates were typically 2.46 X 10-5 mol/s. For the determination of the reaction orders, He was added in order to maintain constant total pressure. Hydrogen partial pressures were varied between 160 and 980 mbar, while the crotonaldehyde partial pressure was varied over the range of 16 to 60 mbar. The reactor efuent was analyzed by an HP5890 gas chromatograph, equipped with a 30 m J&W DB-WAX capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Catalysts were used in prereduced form and rereduced in situ under hydrogen at 673 K for 1 h. Subsequently, the catalysts were allowed to cool to reaction temperature under hydrogen before the reaction was started. Catalytic activities are reported as turnover frequencies (TOF), i.e, the number of crotonaldehyde molecules converted per surface metal atom per second. The number of surface metal atoms was determined from hydrogen chemisorption at 298 K [ 191. Competitive hydrogenation experiments with cis-2-butene were performed on the NilOPt90 and Ni30Pt7O catalysts. He was initially added to the feed and, after reaching steady state, it was substituted by an equimolar flow of the olefin. The olefin-to-crotonaldehyde ratio was 38, while the hydrogento-organic feed ratio was 2. Similarly, competitive hydrogenation with isobutyraldehyde was carried out. The aldehyde was added before the reactor entrance by means of a syringe pump. The ratios of isobutyraldehyde to crotonaldehyde varied from 0.08 to 4.3. 73 Results Adsorption of hydrogen The equilibrium constants for hydrogen adsorption (Fig. 1) decreased significantly from Pt (4.91 kPa-1) to Ni (0.01 kPa-1). Note that the equilibrium constant for NilOPt90 was one order of magnitude, and that for Ni30Pt7O about two orders of magnitude lower compared to that of the Pt catalyst, and remained approximately constant with increasing concentration of Ni. Hydrogenation of crotOLdehyO The turnover frequencies (TOFs), the reaction orders in crotonaldehyde and hydrogen and the apparent energies of activation are compiled in Table 1. TOFs were obtained after 1 h on stream, and approximate steady-state activity. All catalysts exhibited considerable deactivation within this first hour.

The changes in selectivity during this deactivation process will be outlined below. The total hydrogenation activity at 353 K increased more than one order of magnitude, from 0.03 molecules per site per second over Pt to 0.62 molecules per site per second over Ni (see Fig. 2). The most significant increase in TOP was observed between pure Pt and the bimetallic catalyst with 30 at. 4'o Ni. Upon addition of more Ni to the bimetallic catalyst, the activity increased only moderately to the maximum value found with pure Ni and the catalyst containing 10 at.% Pt. The apparent energies of activation forthe overall conversion of crotonaldehyde increased from Pt (43 kJ/mol) to Ni (50 kJ/mol). The reaction orders (determined from the variations in TOP as a function of one partial pressure while maiiitaining the other constant) for H2 varied between + 1 and +0.7 over all catalysts investigated. For crotonaldehyde, a positive reaction order of 0.2 was observed over Ni50Pt50, while over all other catalysts negative reaction orders, ranging from - 0.1 (Pt) to -1 (Ni) were found. Note that the most significant change in reaction order of crotonaldehyde was observed between Ni ( -1) and Ni80Pt2O ( - 0.2), i.e. between catalysts which exhibited very similar turnover frequencies. The selectivities vs. the catalyst composition are compiled in Table 2. Butyraldehyde was the main reaction product on all catalysts, while formation of butanol and n-butane was observed on most catalysts in small amounts. Selectivity to crotyl alcohol was only found for the bimetallic catalysts, and was generally low at 353 K and conversions between 5% and 25ss'o. The highest value was observed for NilOPt90 with 690, while the other samples (i.e. WORM, Ni501't50, Ni70Pt30, Ni80Pt2O and Ni90Pt10) exhibited approximately 3ss'o selectivity to crotyl alcohol. Over Pt/Si02, a catalyst that did not catalyze the formation of crotyl alcohol at 353 K, traces of the unsaturated alcohol were detected at 393 K. It should be emphasized that during the decay in activity, the rate of formation of butyraldehyde decreased faster than the rate of formation of crotyl alcohol. h x m .r _N V m 0.1 o _E O H 0.01 0 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Ni/(Ni+Pt) Fig. 2.

TOF of crotyl alcohol formation over PtNi/Si0z catalysts. The TOFs for crotyl alcohol formation as a function of catalyst composition are shown in Fig. 3. The activity over the bimetallic samples passed through a maximum with catalysts between 30 and 70 at.% Ni. Note that these TOFs were approximately twice that for the least active catalyst, while a 15-fold increase in the rate of formation of butyraldehyde was found in this interval. Over Nil OPt90 (the catalyst with the highest selectivity for crotyl alcohol formation) and WORM, the competitive hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and cis-2-butene was studied. In general, the rate of hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde decreased. The TOF for butyraldehyde formation decreased 16ss'o on NilOPt90 and 25ss'o on Ni30Pt7O, but the rate of formation of crotyl alcohol remained approximately constant. If isobutyraldehyde was added at low partial pressures (p = 5 mbar), the rates for hydrogenation to butyraldehyde and butanol decreases while that to crotyl alcohol remained constant. At higher partial pressures (p = 56 mbar), the rates of all reactions decreased as compared to pure crotonaldehyde feed. 76 Discussion Previous physicochemical characterizations [ 19 ] of the NiPt/Si02 catalysts suggest the presence of at least three distinct phases, pure Pt and Ni and a PtNi phase. The increase in activity as a function of the Ni concentration in the catalysts indicates that these phases have discrete activities (TOF) increasing in the sequence Pt PtNi < Ni. This follows the sequence of apparent energies of activation. It is interesting to note that the numerical values for the rate constant show a somewhat different trend than the rates. There is a slight increase in the value up to Pt50Ni5O and a rather steep increase from that sample to pure Ni. Note that the high rates and the rate constants for Ni-rich catalysts are due to a high pre-exponential factor rather than to a low apparent energy of activation. Because we recorded the variation in rates for the first three hours for each of the experiments, we can exclude that the higher catalytic activity of Ni in comparison to Pt for the hydrogenation of the C=C double bond of crotonaldehyde is affiliated with a lower level of deactivation of the Ni-rich catalysts in comparison to the Pt-rich samples under steady-state conditions. The equilibrium constants for hydrogen adsorption suggest that under equal partial pressures the coverage in HZ is higher on Pt and Ni1OPt90 than on the other catalysts. The very similar reaction orders for HZ (close to + 1) suggest that under reaction conditions surfaces are not saturated with hydrogen. In contrast, the apparent reaction orders with respect to crotonaldehyde were close to zero or slightly negative (except for Ni and Ni90PtlO), indicating fairly high saturation of the surface. This accords well with the results of Simonik and Beranek [18], who determined similar adsorption coefficients for the organic reactants and intermediates during crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, which were much higher than that of H2. Thus, we conclude that the interaction of crotonaldehyde with the metal surface is significantly stronger than that of hydrogen. Hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol was observed at appreciable rates only over bimetallic catalysts. The maximum of the rate around Ni50Pt5O and absence of catalytic activity on the monometallic samples may indicate that hydrogenation of the carbonyl group requires active sites containing Pt and Ni. It is interesting to compare this effect with previous reports indicating that the selectivity of Pt in the hydrogenation of bifunctional molecules could be increased by modification with a less noble metal such as Sri [8, 10, 11 ] or Fe [6]. In accordance with the results of the present study, the increase in selectivity for these modified Pt catalysts was explained by an increase in the specific rate of the carbonyl group hydrogenation. Note that usually the best yields were obtained at rather low concentrations of the less noble metal added to Pt, and that larger concentrations lead to a sharp decrease in activity [10]. Speculatively this was interpreted for the Pt/Sn system with the presence of non-zero valent state Sri- after reduction [ 11 ]. These Sri atoms show low activity for hydrogenation, thus decreasing the overall rate drastically. 77 In analogy to these results, on might speculate that indeed the presence of non-zero valent Ni enhances the rate of hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol. Evidence for the presence of non-zero valent Ni was obtained from XANES of the Pt/Ni catalysts. In the Pt/Ni phase an average charge of + 0.13 was estimated for Ni [20]. The direct correlation between the concentration of the Pt/Ni phase and the rate of hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol suggests that Pt and the positively charged Ni must be in intimate contact. Because we have indirect indication that a small and constant concentration of the Ni deposited is present as unreduced NiSi03 [19], we can exclude that NiSi03 promotes selectivity towards crotyl alcohol. In contrast to the modification with Sn, the catalytic activity of Ni in the Pt/Ni alloy is high. Thus, the increase in rate to butyraldehyde (C=C double bond hydrogenation) overcompensates for the positive effects of Ni in selective C=O hydrogenation. In order to examine why both reactions (C=C and C=O hydrogenation) can be promoted, we performed slugging experiments offering reactants with either the C=C or the C=O double bond for competitive reaction. Competitive hydrogenation experiments with cis-2-butene showed a decrease in the rate of butyraldehyde formation, but the rate for hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol remained unchanged. With isobutyraldehyde as coreactant, all rates dropped at high partial pressures of isobutyraldehyde (p(i-BuHO) = 56 mbar, p(CrHO) -13 mbar), while at low partial pressures (i.e., p(i-BuHO) = 5 mbar, p(CrHO) = 60 mbar) only the rates to butyraldehyde and butanol were adversely affected. These results might indicate two reaction sites. The sites that preferentially hydrogenate to butyraldehyde have a higher adsorption constant than those preferentially hydrogenating to crotyl alcohol. Thus, competing molecules adsorbed only on the stronger sites impede only the reaction to butyraldehyde. At high partial pressures of isobutyraldehyde, both of the sites are blocked (note that for the catalysts investigated, butyraldehyde has always a higher adsorption constant than but-2-ene); at low partial pressures only the (stronger) sites for preferential hydrogenation to butyraldehyde are affected. Again, this interpretation is in reasonable agreement with the conclusions suggested by Simonik and Beranek [ 191 that two kinetically different pathways exist, i.e. hydrogenation of CrHO to BuHO and BuOH, and hydrogenation of CrHO to CrOH (and isomerization to BuHO) and further hydrogenation to BuOH. At present we can only speculate on the nature of these two adsorption sites. Previously [ 171, it was postulated that active sites may exist at the interphase between metallic particles and polar phases (e.g. oxides). The polarity of the phase was claimed to increase the interaction of the C=O groups with the surface and, thus, the reactivity of the C=O group for hydrogenation. Considering the structure of PtNi alloys (see Fig. 4) an apparent enrichment of the topmost layer by Pt may exist, e.g. by preferential exposure of (100) surfaces [21 ]. There should, however, also be surfaces which exhibit Ni as well as Pt, e.g. the (010) surface. One might thus tentatively speculate that these surfaces, although small in concentration, 78 Q Ni Pt Fig. 4. Structure of the f.c.c. PtNi alloy. are responsible for the enhancement of the rate of hydrogenation to crotonaldehyde. On these surfaces a slight polarity due to negatively charged Pt and positively charged Ni should exist. This might help to increase interaction with the C=O groups and thus help to increase the rate of hydrogenation to crotyl alcohol. Note that the proposed lower interaction of these surfaces with crotonaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde and butene is indirectly reflected in the highest reaction order with respect to crotonaldehyde found with Ni50Pt5O. Conclusions Addition of Ni to Pt/Si02 caused an increase in the rate of hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol and to butyraldehyde. The increase in the rate of selective hydrogenation of the C=O bond was found to be proportional to the concentration of the NiPt phase, and passed through a maximum at the Ni50Pt5O catalyst. The increase in the rate of the C=C bond hydrogenation is proportional to the presence of Ni, and shows a steady increase from Pt/Si02 to Ni/Si02 with the latter being the most active in this reaction. Two sites (surfaces) were concluded to exist on the alloys, one consisting primarily of Pt, the other exhibiting Pt as well as Ni in the topmost layer of the surface. Hydrogenation of the C=C was affiliated with the pure Ni or Pt surface, hydrogenation of the C=O group with the PtNi surface. Ni present on these surfaces was concluded to have a slightly positive charge, which is speculated to be the primary reason for the enhancement in selectivity.

        "dc:description": "The hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over a series of Pt/Ni catalysts was investigated. While the rate of hydrogenation to butyraldehyde was a monotonic function of the Ni concentration, the rate to crotyl alcohol was related to the concentration of the PtNi alloy. The selectivity to hydrogenation of the carbonyl group was attributed to the presence of polar surfaces (negatively charged Pt and positively charged Ni). Two independent sites, catalyzing the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butyraldehyde and to crotyl alcohol, were established.",
