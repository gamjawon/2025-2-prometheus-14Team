Graphical abstract In this study, two types of core@shell nanoparticles, CeO2@Pd and inverse Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles, were synthesized by sequential deposition and electrostatic attraction-induced deposition method, respectively. Then, the core@shell nanoparticles supported on halloysite were thermally treated at different temperatures, and the nascent core@shell/H-x catalysts were characterized and evaluated for their three-way catalytic performance. During the thermal treatment (650 °C, 800 °C, and 1100 °C), the CeO2@Pd/H-x catalysts showed strong temperature sensitivity, resulting in aggregation of the active metal particles, degradation of the textural properties, and weak interactions between the active sites and support, accompanied by the deactivation of the three-way reaction. Remarkably, Pd@CeO2/H-800 exhibits excellent catalytic performance because it has an appropriate Pd-CeO2 interaction and high thermal stability, which effectively suppresses the encapsulation and aggregation of Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles and imparts a high content of Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies and equivalent of Pd2+/Pd° ratio. Keywords Core-shell structure Thermal treatment Three-way catalyst Halloysite 1 Introduction In recent decades, air pollution has attracted increasing worldwide concern, with the rapid development of vehicles becoming a major problem. Therefore, technology for the purification of vehicle exhaust that can convert exhausted nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) into harmless gases is of considerable importance [1–3]. Three-way catalysts (TWCs) have been considered the most successful treatment system for gasoline engine exhaust. Typical TWCs are composed of noble metals such as Rh, Pt and Pd as the active metal [3–5]; alumina as the support; and ceria zirconia as the promoter to enhance oxygen storage capacity and thermal stability [6–8]. Pd-only catalyst has been fabricated for its better catalytic performance for hydrocarbon oxidation and durability at high temperatures than other precious metals [9–11]. On the other hand, extensive research indicates that ceria is an effective promoter in catalytic reactions due to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and redox properties and the interaction between reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ and Pd1+/Pd0 [12–15]. Generally, TWCs are placed in a close-coupled location near the exhaust manifold outlet to rapidly achieve light-off after cold start [16]. Such harsh conditions can result in inevitable deactivation of TWCs that may include metal particle growth, weak metal-support interactions, a variety of valence states, and even collapse of the support [17,18]. It has been reported that the decomposition of PdO into Pd° at 750 °C could worsen Pd species aggregation [13,19]. Thus, it is difficult to maintain PdO with catalytic activity at close-coupled locations (greater than > 1000 °C). As a result, the catalytic activity is suppressed by the sintered bulk Pd° particles and the decrease in PdO species [5]. Therefore, a large number of studies have reported that CeO2-based catalysts can stabilize PdO species via interactions with surface active oxygen and that ceria can increase the reoxidation of Pd° and inhibit Pd species aggregation by an intimate interaction [19,20], which demonstrates the importance of the ceria material. However, the CeO2 composite in the TWC system is prone to severe sintering and agglomeration after high-temperature treatment, resulting in a decrease in active sites and encapsulation of the noble metal. Some authors consider that the formation of CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide and CeO2-ZrO2-Al2O3 composites can lead to high OSCs and improve thermal stability [13,21,22], while other studies have indicated that the two interfering oxides (Al2O3 and CZ) have difficulty reacting with each other [1,23,24]. Recently, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) have received considerable research attention due to their unique tubular structure and physical-chemical properties [25–28]. HNTs with a general formula of Al2SiO5(OH)4·nH2O form rolled aluminosilicate sheets with external diameters of 40−60 nm and internal diameters of 10−15 nm [29,30]. The layers have SiO groups at the outer surface and AlOH groups at the inner surface, and these groups are linked to each other by hydrogen bonds [31,32]. In particular, the outer surface is negatively charged, and the inner surface is positively charged, which allows selective loading of different molecules [33–35]. Thus, numerous HNT studies have focused on water treatment, and it has been reported that heavy metals can be efficiently adsorbed because of the electrochemical properties of HNTs [27,36]. Until now, only a few studies have noted the high thermal stability of HNTs with porous and tubular structures, which is beneficial for gas catalytic reactions. As reported in the literature [30,32,37], HNTs act as channels for gases to enter and exit the inner part of the CZ matrix, shorten the diffusion of O atoms, and maintain a constant structure after a high-temperature reaction. On the other hand, some studies have indicated that HNTs act as sintering barriers as well as shell protectors and can thus enhance thermal stability and avoid catalyst aggregation [38,39]. As mentioned above, HNTs are regarded as a potential and desirable material for three-way catalysis. As is well known, the electron transfer and interaction between Pd and CeO2, which can deeply affect the catalytic performance, have received increasing attention. To enhance the metal-support interaction and inhibit migration of the metal, formation of a core-shell structure has been identified as the most efficient solution. Ozawa et al. indicated that the core-shell type of CeO2/ZrO2 provides active sites on Pt/CeO2/ZrO2 because CeO2 nanoparticles are stabilized on ZrO2, resulting in a high OSC and TWC activity [40]. Hill et al. demonstrated that thermally induced restructuring of Pd@CeO2 catalyst could promote low-temperature catalytic activity due to the redispersion of Pd in CeO2 is occurred with a change in oxidation state [41]. Li et al. reported that the core-shell structure of Pd@Ce0.5Zr0.5O2/Al2O3 maintained the Pd particle size and core-shell structure at 1050 °C in the presence of 10 % water [42], and the moisture treatment of m-Pd@CeO2/Al2O3 promoted the generation of *OOH species for enhancing TWC activity [43]. In our previous study, a Pd@6CeO2/HNT catalyst with optimal shell properties and thickness exhibited higher core-shell particle dispersion and thermal resistance than Pd@6CeO2/Al2O3 in a three-way catalytic reaction [35]. These previous studies have provided considerable insight into the TWC performance over core-shell catalysts. However, some questions remain: How does the core@shell structure of CeO2 and Pd affect their activity? How does the thermal treatment affect the core@shell structure and its physical-chemical properties? Although it is generally accepted that ceria promotes redox ability, shell materials can protect metals from sintering, and finely dispersed metals are beneficial for catalytic activity, no detailed investigations on the relationship between the Pd-CeO2 structure and the temperature used in thermal treatment have been carried out. In this work, a series of halloysite-supported Pd@CeO2 and inverse CeO2@Pd nanoparticles with different calcination temperatures were prepared, and the three-way catalytic performance was evaluated. The detailed structure and textural properties of CeO2@Pd/HNT and Pd@CeO2/HNT after calcination at different temperatures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of core@shell nanoparticles Two types of core@shell nanoparticles with a defined molar ratio of Ce/Pd = 6 were synthesized by different preparation methods. The first type of core@shell nanoparticles consisting of Pd doped on the CeO2 core, named C@P nanoparticles. The preparation method of C@P was described and modified in the literature [44–46]. The C@P nanoparticles were prepared by sequential deposition involving the reduction of 2.85 mmol of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Acros, 99.5 %) with 2 g of PVP55000 (Sigma-Aldrich, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, K30) and 100 mL of ethylene glycol (J.T. Baker, ethylene glycol, 99.9 %) reflux for 30 min. Afterward, the solution was refluxed for another 2 h at 190 °C at 5 °C/min. After cooling to 80 °C, 10 mL of 1 % Pd(NO3)2 solution (Alfa Aesar, Pd(NO3)2·xH2O, 39 %) was added, and the mixture was slowly heated back to reflux for 1.5 h to give a black colloidal solution. Finally, the C@P products were washed with absolute ethanol 3 times to remove excess PVP and glycol, followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. The second type of core@shell nanoparticle is the Pd core encapsulated by the CeO2 shell, which is named P@C nanoparticles. The synthesis method of P@C was described in a previous report [35,47,48] as follows: KBr (1.5 g) was dissolved in deionized water (100 mL) and heated at 60 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, 1 % Pd(NO3)2 solution, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and 0.005 M ammonia (50 mL) were dropped into the solution and stirred at 60 °C for 1.5 h. Afterward, the P@C nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and then dried at 60 °C overnight. 2.2 Halloysite supported core@shell nanoparticles The synthesis method of core@shell supported on halloysite was described in our previous work [35]. First, halloysite nanotube powder (Sigma-Aldrich, Al2SiO5(OH)4·2H2O) was mixed with 100 mL of deionized water at 80 °C and stirred for 2 h. Separately, various core-shell nanoparticles (CeO2@Pd and Pd@CeO2) were dispersed in deionized water (50 mL) under ultrasonication. Then, the core-shell colloid solution was added dropwise into the as-prepared halloysite solution and heated at 80 °C for 2 h, followed by washing, centrifuging and drying at 60 °C overnight. The theoretical Pd loading of the core@shell/HNT catalysts is 1 wt%. Finally, the sample was ground and calcined at different temperatures in air for 3 h. The obtained sample was named C@P/H-x and P@C/H-x (x = 650, 800, and 1100 °C to represent the calcination temperature), respectively. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The textural properties of the as-prepared catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption experiments at 77 K through BET (201-AEL, PMI). The morphology of the as-catalysts and spent catalysts was observed by TEM (JEOL JEM-1200CXII). The crystallite size of the catalysts was identified by XRD (BURKER, D8-SSS) using a Cu Kα radiation (λ =0.154 nm) source and a scattering angle of 2θ = 10∼80° at a rate of 2°/min. In addition, the crystallite size of CeO2 was calculated by the Scherrer equation from line broadening, which corresponds to the (111) crystal plane. The chemical state and chemical composition on the surface of the catalysts were analyzed by XPS (PHI-5000) using Al Kα radiation (hυ=1486.6 eV). The binding energies were calibrated by using C 1s at a binding energy of 284.8 eV. 2.4 Catalytic activity evaluation The catalytic activity was measured in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor (i.d. 10 mm) with simulated exhaust from a gasoline engine. The catalyst (0.2 g) was held in a quartz tube, which was placed in a tubular electric furnace (i.d./o.d. 20/300 mm). The reaction gas was composed of NO (1000 ppm), CO (0.3 %), C3H8 (400 ppm), and O2 (0.2 %) and balanced with nitrogen. The feed stream was regulated by special mass flow controllers before entering the blender, and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was fixed at 64,000 h−1. Prior to the catalytic reaction, the catalyst was pretreated at 300 °C for 2 h under 10 % H2 with N2. The air/fuel ratio (λ) of simulated gases, which represents the ratio between the available oxygen and the oxygen needed for full conversion to H2O, CO2 and N2, is defined as λ = {2[O2]+[NO]}/{10[C3H8]+[CO]}. λ = 1 was applied in all catalytic activity measurement. The inlet and outlet flow gases were continuously analyzed and recorded by a gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and an online flue gas analyzer (PG-250, HORIBA), and accordingly, the conversion of NOx, CO and C3H8 was calculated based on the following equations: N O x c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = [ N O ] i n - [ N O ] o u t [ N O ] i n × 100 % C O c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = [ C O ] i n - [ C O ] o u t [ C O ] i n × 100 % C 3 H 8 c o n v e r s i o n ( % ) = C 3 H 8 i n - C 3 H 8 o u t C 3 H 8 i n × 100 % 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Textural and structural characterization results Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analyses were conducted to investigate the pore properties of the as-prepared catalysts and are depicted in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1a and b, all the samples have similar adsorption-desorption isotherms. According to the IUPAC recommendation, the isotherm could be classified as type IV with H3 hysteresis loops, which are usually given by mesoporous and microporous structures [49–51]. The hysteresis in the isotherms is associated with filling and emptying of the mesopores by capillary condensation. It is noticed that the pore volume significantly decreases for the catalysts calcined at 1100 °C because of the aggregation of particles and the collapse of the tubular structures [50], consistent with the later-mentioned TEM observation. The pore size distribution is determined from N2 adsorption by the BJH method, and the results are depicted in Fig. 1c and d. As a result, the primary particle distribution had a narrow range of 2−5 nm for all samples. In particular, C@P/H-650 and C@P/H-800 showed a minor mesopore distribution in the range of 10−20 nm, which may result from the C@P nanoparticles. The textural properties, including specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter, derived from the isotherms are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1, the surface area of the C@P/H-x catalysts shows a decreasing tendency with increasing calcination temperature. Upon high thermal treatment (1100 °C), severe aggregation and collapse of primary particles inevitably occur for catalysts, which results from the collapse of halloysite and leads to a decrease in surface area and pore volume [50,51]. However, P@C/H-800 shows the highest surface area (48.7 m2/g). This slight increase in the SBET of P@C/H-800 might be due to the formation of micropores during surface breakage resulting from structural rearrangement or transformation [51] and the appreciated Pd-CeO2 interaction. Accordingly, P@C/H-800 exhibits the highest surface area, which is attributed to the well-dispersed P@C nanoparticles exhibiting better resistance to thermal degradation of textural properties. 3.2 XRD analysis The XRD patterns of C@P/H-x and P@C/H-x are presented in Fig. 2 and summarize the crystallite sizes calculated based on the Scherrer equation. As shown therein, the peaks of all catalysts correspond well with the characteristic peaks of cubic fluorite CeO2 (JCPDS-34-0394) [35,52]. Moreover, the peaks at 2θ = 20.8° and 26.5° were assigned to the halloysite (JCPDS-29-1487) [51,53], which were observed for all as-prepared catalysts. It is worth mentioning that the peak signals of CeO2 and halloysite of all samples become sharper with increasing calcination temperature, suggesting grain growth during the thermal process. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, the average crystallite size of the reflections of CeO2 (111) is increased with increasing calcination temperature, and the crystallite size of P@C/H-x is larger than that of C@P/H-x. The phenomenon can be ascribe that the outer surface shell is consist of intimate CeO2 nanoparticles with good crystallization, resulting in large CeO2 crystals with sharp characteristic peaks. No peaks related to the metallic Pd and PdO phases can be found for the catalysts calcined below 800 °C because the low Pd loading or Pd is well dispersed and the grain size is below the detection limit of XRD. Subsequently, the PdO peaks are observed at 2θ = 33.8° and 59.3° for C@P/H-1100 and P@C/H-1100, while C@P/H-1100 exhibits much more intense metallic Pd peaks at 2θ = 40° and 46°. Accordingly, the crystalline CeO2 shell may contribute to increase redispersion of Pd owing to the CeO2 shell has grain boundaries can provide additional routs for metal movement [41,54]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that P@C/H-x catalysts perform well in particle dispersion and inhibit Pd agglomeration, which is consistent with the BET results. 3.3 XPS analysis The surface chemical valence and surface atomic ratios for the as-prepared catalysts were measured by XPS. Fig. 3 a-b, c-d, and Fig. 4 show the Ce 3d, Pd 3d, and O 1s spectra, respectively, and the obtained results are compiled in Table 2 . Fig. 3a-b presents the Ce 3d XPS spectra of catalysts, which are composed of eight peaks and can be fitted into four different spin-orbit doubles. The peaks marked as u and v represent 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, respectively; among them, the peaks marked as u, u’’ and u”’ arise from Ce4+ 3d3/2, while the peaks marked as v, v’’ and v’’’ originate from Ce4+ 3d5/2, and the doublets u’ and v’ are assigned to Ce3+ 3d3/2 and Ce3+ 3d5/2 [2,55]. According to the literature [12,56], the presence of Ce3+ is related to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which favor the promotion of redox behavior and catalytic performance. As shown in Table 2, the results show that the percentage of Ce3+ presents a decreasing tendency of P@C/H-800 (23.59 %) > P@C/H-650 (23.28 %) > C@P/H-650 (22.12 %) > C@P/H-800 (21.72 %) > P@C/H-1100 (19.24 %) > C@P/H-1100 (18.56 %). The surface Ce3+ content slightly changes when the C@P/H-x and P@C/H-x catalyst calcined at 650 °C or 800 °C. However, the Ce3+ content obviously decreases when the catalysts after calcining at 1100 °C, which may be caused by particle growth or deterioration of the structure. In addition, the total Ce 3d peak area of the C@P/H-x catalysts greatly decreases when the calcination temperature increases to 1100 °C, which is attributed to the formation of bulk CeO2 particles. Remarkably, P@C/H-800 shows the highest content of Ce3+ and maintains a large amount of Ce species, suggesting that it favors stabilizing oxidative PdO species and enhancing catalytic activity [18,20]. As shown in Fig. 3c-d, the XPS Pd 3d spectra of the as-prepared catalysts can be deconvoluted into four peaks associated with two spin orbitals. The binding energies at 340.8–342.2 eV and 335.4–336.8 eV are assigned to Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2, respectively [6,19,57]. The fraction of Pd2+/Pd° was calculated and is listed in Table 2. The P@C/H-800 catalyst presents an equivalent Pd2+/Pd° ratio (1.09), implying that the catalyst has a high redox ability [18,38]. Nevertheless, the C@P/H-1100 catalyst has a low ratio of Pd2+/Pd° (0.20), which is attributed to the PdO species undergoing reduction to metallic Pd° at high-temperature treatment, coincident with the XRD results. Moreover, Pd species tend to aggregation into large Pd° particles because of the sever sintering and segregation of the support [12]. Fig. 4 depicts the O 1s XPS spectra of the as-prepared catalysts. The peak at 529.9–530.9 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen (denoted as OI), which is mainly associated with ceria. The peak at 531.4–531.9 eV is assigned to surface adsorbed oxygen (denoted as OII) [18,55]. Among them, OII is more active than OI in oxidation due to its high mobility, and the surface content of OII of the six catalysts is listed in Table 2. As a result, the P@C/H-800 catalyst had the highest amount of OII (55.37 %), suggesting that more active oxygen species promote high catalytic performance. In summary, the P@C/H-800 catalyst has a high fraction of Ce3+, equivalent Pd2+/Pd° ratio, and a large amount of active oxygen species, which results from the thermally resistant Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles having strong Pd-CeO2 interactions and particle dispersion and consequently facilitating the three-way catalytic reaction. 3.4 TEM study TEM was used to observe the morphology of the nanoparticles, and the results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . Fig. 5 displays the TEM images of the two types of core@shell nanoparticles. The Pd and CeO2 particles are labeled by red solid circle and white dotted circle, respectively. As presented in Fig. 5a-b, it is observed that the particle size of C@P nanoparticles is approximately 25−30 nm, and very small Pd species appear to be finely doped on CeO2 core particles. However, with respect to the P@C nanoparticle consist of Pd core with 10 nm in diameter, which is encapsulated by numerous CeO2 shell particles ranging from 13−15 nm in thickness, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. The particle size of P@C is approximately 15−20 nm, which is similar to our previous report [35]. Thus, two types of core@shell nanoparticles were successfully synthesized in this work, while P@C nanoparticles show a more uniform structure than C@P nanoparticles. As seen by further investigation, the C@P and P@C nanoparticles were supported on halloysite and then calcined at various temperatures, as displayed in Fig. 6. At low thermal treatment, both C@P/H-650 and P@C/H-650 exhibited good nanoparticle dispersion, and the particle size of C@P and P@C could be maintained (the insets in Fig. 6a and d). After being thermally treated at 800 °C, the C@P/H-800 catalyst shows obvious aggregation and sintering, suggesting that the weak interaction of C@P nanoparticles could not suppress the growth of grain size and the migration of particles, as shown in Fig. 6b. In the case of P@C/H-800, the particles are comparatively dispersed and anti-sintering, which may be attributed to the mutual stabilization between the CeO2 shell and Pd core and the strong interaction between P@C and halloysite, contributing to notable thermal resistance upon thermal treatment. Notably, as presented in Fig. 6a-b and d-e, the morphology of halloysite remained tubular after 650 °C or 800 °C calcination. However, as the calcination temperature increased to 1100 °C, severe sintering of the core@shell nanoparticles and the collapse of halloysite for the C@P/H-1100 and P@C/H-1100 catalysts were observed, as shown in Fig. 6c and f. As reported [50,51], the morphology of halloysite was distorted in their tubular outlines by over 1000 °C treatment, which may have caused core@shell migration and agglomeration. Therefore, the tubular halloysite with multilayer structure can promote dispersion of core@shell nanoparticles is significant for catalytic stability. 3.5 Three-way catalytic performance The three-way catalytic performance was evaluated, and the gas conversion of NOx, CO, and C3H8 for the as-prepared catalysts is displayed in Fig. 7 and Table 3 . As shown in Table 3, C@P/H-650 shows an outstanding light-off (T50) and full-conversion temperature (T90) of CO and a similar T50 for NOx and C3H8 conversion with the C@P/H-800 catalyst. Moreover, C@P/H-1100 gives the worst T50 of the three contaminations. These results may be attributed to the aggregation of the particles, poor redox ability, and the reduction of surface area and pore volume, consistent with TEM, XPS, and BET analysis. In the case of the P@C/H-x catalysts, the conversion curve in Fig. 7 reveals that the conversion efficiency of NOx, CO, and C3H8 decreases in the order of P@C/H-800 > P@C/H-650 > P@C/H-1100; that is, P@C/H-800 exhibits a high surface content of Ce3+, OII, and the largest SBET. Moreover, high-temperature 800 °C aging could induce restructuring of Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles and generate plenty of Pd species, resulting in the Pd redispersed into the encapsulating shell and highly active for oxidation [41]. It is worth noting that C@P/H-650 and P@C/H-650 have a very slight influence on the NOx and CO conversion. That is, the thermal treatment at 650 °C did not affect the main physical-chemical properties of the two core@shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, a comparison of the C@P/H-x and P@C/H-x catalysts reveals that P@C/H-x has better catalytic performance in terms of overall gas conversion. According to the massive literature reported [5,12,13], the difference in catalytic performance may be related to some critical reasons as follows: (i) The particle dispersion of the catalyst is related to the number of active sites and the interaction between active sites and support. (ii) The textural structure, including the surface area and total volume of the catalyst, can mainly affect the catalytic performance. Furthermore, the larger surface area could facilitate highly dispersed Pd to provide abundant active sites. (iii) The redox property of the catalyst is a crucial factor for catalytic reactions. The oxidation of CO and C3H8 and the reduction of NOx are largely determined by PdO species and metallic Pd species, respectively. The surface content of Ce species and oxygen vacancies for the catalysts also takes part in the redox reaction and the stability of the catalyst. Consequently, P@C/H-800 exhibits superior catalytic performance due to its high particle dispersion, excellent texture and structural properties and redox ability. 4 Conclusion Based on the analysis results mentioned above, some conclusions could be reached. The particle dispersion and structural properties of C@P/H-x were significantly affected by the thermal temperature. When the C@P/H-x catalyst is subjected to thermal treatment at elevated temperatures, a decrease in the surface area and metal sintering occurs, leading to a gradual decrease in the catalytic performance. Halloysite support can promote the dispersion of core@shell nanoparticles and enhance the thermal stability of the catalyst, however, the tubular structure would be partly destroyed during the 1100 °C calcination process, which resulted in the aggregation of particles and collapse of the support. In the case of the P@C/H-x catalysts, the P@C nanoparticles still maintain a high dispersion on the halloysite support below 1100 °C calcination. In particular, P@C/H-800 exhibits a high surface content of Ce3+, oxygen vacancies, and the equivalent of Pd2+/Pd°, accompanied by a high conversion efficiency of contaminants. Hence, the most favorable structure of the P@C/H-800 catalyst not only maintains excellent thermal stability but also imparts superior three-way catalytic reactions. This study could provide some inspiration for the design of core@shell-supported catalysts with high stability and excellent three-way performance.

        "dc:description": "In this study, two types of core@shell nanoparticles, CeO2@Pd and inverse Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles, were synthesized by sequential deposition and electrostatic attraction-induced deposition method, respectively. Then, the core@shell nanoparticles supported on halloysite were thermally treated at different temperatures, and the nascent core@shell/H-x catalysts were characterized and evaluated for their three-way catalytic performance. During the thermal treatment (650 °C, 800 °C, and 1100 °C), the CeO2@Pd/H-x catalysts showed strong temperature sensitivity, resulting in aggregation of the active metal particles, degradation of the textural properties, and weak interactions between the active sites and support, accompanied by the deactivation of the three-way reaction. Remarkably, Pd@CeO2/H-800 exhibits excellent catalytic performance because it has an appropriate Pd-CeO2 interaction and high thermal stability, which effectively suppresses the encapsulation and aggregation of Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles and imparts a high content of Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancies and equivalent of Pd2+/Pd° ratio.",
