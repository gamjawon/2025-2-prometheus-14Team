Pineda, J.M. Palacios * Instituto de Catdlisis y Petroleoquimica, CS1C, Campus Universidad Autdnoma, Cantoblanco, 28049-Madrid, Spain Received 30 August 1995; accepted 30 October 1995 Abstract Using a kinetic equation derived from results obtained in a differential reactor, a grain model with variable properties was applied to calculate the global reaction rate for a particle. Further- more, the theoretical model was developed to explain the performance of alumina as a catalyst for the Claus reaction at low temperature in an integral fixed bed reactor. The results were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The theoretical model was used to study the influence of the most significative parameters involved and to predict the catalyst performance in conditions of practical interest. It was shown that high H2S conversions and efficiencies of the catalyst were to be expected using highly porous materials and small particle sizes. These are the most important parameters for practical utilization. Keywords: Alumina; Claus reaction; Hydrogen sulphide; SuLphur I. Introduction The Claus reaction at high temperature (ca. 240) using ]/-AI2O3 as a catalyst is used as a second step in the Claus industrial process for the elimination of sulphur compounds from natural gas and oil desulphurization products. H2S conversions close to those expected from thermodynamic consid- erations are achieved [1,2]. The elemental sulphur gas formed as a reaction product is cooled and trapped in the liquid state. * Corresponding author.

Palacios /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 81-96 Since it is an exothermic process, higher H2S conversions could be expected if the reaction temperature were lowered (ca. 100). However, for practical use the rate of reaction should be kept high enough and the solid sulphur, in this case formed and retained in the catalyst, should not deactivate it, at least, until high levels of retained sulphur are reached. Previous results [3] have shown that H2S conversions higher than 90% can be achieved using HzS concentrations in the range 1-5% with a relatively slow catalyst deactivation. These figures make the Claus process at low temperature a potential technological process of great interest, especially, if the operation conditions and catalyst properties could be optimized. 2. Experimental Microcrystalline y-alumina with a pore volume Vp = 0.33 cm3/g and specific BET nitrogen surface area S = 185 mZ/g was used as a catalyst for the Claus reaction in a stainless steel upflow fixed bed reactor 1 cm id. The reactants, HzS and SO2, were fed from cylinders with mass flow controllers and passed through a water evaporator where the saturated vapor pressure was reached. The temperature of the reaction chamber was thermostated at 100 and the reaction temperature measured by a thermocouple immersed in the catalytic bed. The observed variations of temperature were less than 5 with reference to the set value. Some of the elemental sulphur not retained in the catalytic bed was trapped in a refrigerator situated downstream. The inlet and outlet gases of the reactor were analyzed by GC using a thermal conductivity detector. The experiments have been undertaken at a reaction temperature T = 100, atmo- spheric pressure, total flow of inlet gases F = 250 cm3/min, inlet gas composi- tion CH~s = 4 VO1.-%, CSO2 = 2 VOI.-%, N2 = balance and bed mass of catalyst m = 0.69 g. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Kinetic equation for the Claus reaction at low temperature Different kinetic equations have been proposed in the literature [4-9] for the Claus reaction: H2S + 1SO2 --.> I~Sn -q- H20 that are valid for high H2S concentration and high temperature (200-270). They are mostly based on power law models for the reaction rate such as: -rr~,.s = K1 exp_E,,/r PH2S P~6~ (1 + K2 PH20)\"2 (1) M. Pineda, J.M. Palacios /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 136 (1996) 81-96 83 where /71 = 0--0.5 and n2 = 1 or 2. These were obtained far from the conditions used in this work and, consequently, the utility had to be checked before use. Recently [10], kinetic data were obtained in the same operation conditions to those used here (T= 60-150 and cH2s = 0.5%-5%) in experiments con- ducted in a differential reactor using H2S conversions lower than 10% and suitable flow and particle size, in order to check that the chemical process was mostly controlled by the intrinsic reaction. The experimental data were fitted to different kinetic equations on the basis of reaction mechanisms supported by FTIR and EPR spectroscopic results, statistical fitting and physical meaning of the determined constants. Unfortunately, these kinetic equations are complex and very difficult to be included in a numerical calculation. In this paper, however, for the sake of calculation simplicity, the same experimental data were fitted to power law type equations like Eq. (1) valid at high temperature. The constants appearing in this equation were determined by linear and non-linear fitting methods (Eq. (2)): pO.6 _0.5 /)SO2 -r.2s = 0.32exp(- 1208/T) (1 + 0.16 PH~-2.

I 80 difficult, in spite of the caution taken in order to assure the exposition of a fresh alumina surface. In fact, in an integral reactor, presumably, fresh surfaces are only exposed to the reactants at the first instant, then a sulphur film of increasing thickness progressively plugs the pores deactivating the catalyst. In a previous study [11], it was assumed that the sulphur blocked the active sites located on the alumina surface and, consequently, catalyst deactivation followed a square law of the coating. This deactivation function was included as a correction factor in the kinetic equation and introduced directly in the mass balance equation for the fixed bed reactor. This model predicted a steep gradient of sulphur concentration along the bed that has not been evidenced experimen- tally. Some experiments show that the Claus reaction can take place on the surface of the sulphur just deposited and catalyst deactivation occurs very slowly: (a) Sulphurized alumina from different experiments were homogenized in an agate mortar and the sulphur concentration determined by SEM-EDX. These samples were then used as catalytic beds and the HzS conversion at the first instant plotted vs. the sulphur concentration of the bed. The results in Fig. 2 show that sulphurized alumina with a sulphur content, much higher than a theoretical monolayer, still achieved a very high HzS conversion. Sulphurized alumina with a heavy sulphur content, equal to the maximum permissible sulphur content (S = 68%) if the pores were assumed to be completely filled with sulphur, showed that the H2S conversion was still much higher than that of the blank M.

(b) EPR spectroscopic data [12] showed that sulphur deposition was associated in time with the development of an EPR signal that could be assigned to radical sulphur species (S2 Sn etc.). Although, the role of these radical species is still object of controversy, that means that the Claus reaction may proceed in sites located on the sulphur surface in substitution of the original sites located on the fresh alumina surface. In this case, the apparent catalyst deactivation observed was not a consequence of site blocking but another slower process, a simple decreasing of the specific surface area as the sulphur content increases. To obtain kinematic parameters from sulphurized alumina is a very difficult matter because the process is mostly controlled by diffusion of reactant gases, however, some experiments at different temperatures, shown in Fig. 3, indicated that, in spite of the observed large scattering, the dependence of the reaction rate on the HzS partial pressure of sulphurized alumina was similar to that of the fresh aluminaConsequently, numerical calculations were conducted assuming that the kinetic Eq. (2), obtained for fresh samples of alumina, was also valid for sulphurized alumina. 3.2. Intraparticle flow: the grain model with uariable properties The structural unity of the catalytic bed was assumed to be the particle of spherical shape and uniform size alp. The reactant gases flow through the particle with diffusion as the only driving force|n a previous study [11], it was 86 M. Pineda, J.M. Palacios /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 81-96 assumed that the reaction took place in the pore wall and that the textural properties of the catalyst remained constant. The effect of the deposited sulphur was mathematically accounted for through the deactivation function proportional to the square of the sulphur coating. In this paper, however, the catalyst was assumed to be uniformly porous with a mean pore radius rm of cylindrical shape decreasing with time. The chemical reaction took place isothermally, at first, on the fresh alumina and then either in the interface sulphur-alumina or gas- sulphur.

For a more detailed description of the grain model with variable properties see Refs. [13,14]. Eqs. (3)-(7) were solved numerically for the operation conditions. Previous calculations showed that the results did not depend on kin, Da, Dm because the process was neither controlled by the mass transference through the gaseous film nor by diffusion through the deposited sulphur film and De was mainly determined by the capillary diffusion Dk. In Fig. 4, the evolution of the mean sulphur conversion Xs of a catalyst particle is shown. When XS = 1, all the fresh alumina pores have been com- pletely filled with elemental sulphur. Taking into account the pore volume of fresh alumina, it corresponded to a sulphur concentration cs = 68 wt.-%. At first, the mean conversion of the particle Xs increased steeply with time but then progressively slowed down. It is apparent that the global reaction rate of the particle was mainly controlled by the diffusion of reactant gases through a medium of progressively decreasing porosity. The final conversion depended strongly on the textural properties of the fresh catalyst used and, evidently, on the number of pores inaccessible to the reactant gases which increased with time. Some numerical treatments concerning processes physically similar to that described in this paper accounted for the evolution of the pore distribution [15] and could be included in future work. In Fig. 5, the evolution of the specific surface area and the pore volume of a particle as a consequence of the pore radius decrease is shown. After the first ten 88 M. Pineda, J.M.

The pore volume was less affected because it depended mostly on the large pores that were completely filled much later. In Fig. 6, the variation of the local conversions x~ across a particle radius for different particle mean conversions Xs is shown. At low mean conversion (X~ = 0.22), almost all the deposited sulphur was located in the 20% radius outer shell where the sulphur concentration varied steeply from large to small values. At higher mean conversions, there were no differences qualitatively and the frontwave proceeded towards the particle center. At very high mean conversion (Xs = 0.92), an inner nucleus about 30% of the radius still existed where the sulphur concentration was very small. In quantitative terms, the contribution of this non-converted nucleus was negligible and high mean conversions were achieved. The theoretical predictions of the model have been proved experimentally in Fig. 7 by SEM-EDX line profiles of AI K o~ and S K o~ taken across a particle diameter of alumina. The analyzed mean sulphur concentration was 13% which corresponded to X~ = 0.20. As shown, sulphur was mostly located on an outer shell of 14% of the radius in agreement with the predictions of the theory (Fig. 6). The main utility of the grain model with variable properties was that it allowed calculation of the global reaction rate of a particle as a function of the M. Pineda, J.M.

In all of the mean conversion range, the global reaction rate depended linearly on the HzS concentration on the particle surface of the catalyst. These results facilitated the numerical calculations because only a data base of the global reaction rate dependence on the mean particle conversion, determined theoretically by the grain model at the same operation conditions, was necessary. 3.3. Model used for a fixed bed reactor An axial symmetrical flow of gases along z (unidimensional), with pressure and diffusion as driving forces and isothermal conditions were assumed. The particles were in equilibrium with the surrounding reactant gases and the global reaction rate of a particle was that calculated by the grain model of variable properties, as with those of Figs. 8 and 9 (pseudosteady state). The mass balance equation in the fixed bed reactor was: OCH.S 02CH2s 0ell2s -D~f v +R~,(cH~s,X~) (8) Ot OZ2 OZ with the usual boundary conditions: 0 Z = --(CH2Sz=0 -- C(HzS)g) ~ OZ ]z=l z= 0 Oef where Def the diffusion coefficient of HzS along the bed, v gas velocity, t time, z vertical coordinate along the reactor, Rv particle global reaction rate, CH2s z=0 HzS concentration at reactor bottom, c(H~s)~ = HzS concentration at the gas phase inlet, l bed height. Eqs. (8)-(9) were evaluated numerically using a constant value Def = 2 10-4 m2 s i and a data base for Rv(CH2s, XS) at the reaction conditions. In Fig. 10, the theoretical results are compared with the experimental ones and the agreement for conversions XH2s higher than 0.2 is good. For the calculations, the initial pore radius of fresh alumina was obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry. For lower conversions both, theoretical and experimental results, are not very reliable, the theoretical ones because rapid deactivation of the catalyst at the tested conditions makes the numerical method prone to division by zero, the experimental ones because of analyzing errors. Under these circumstances, comparison at low conversion was problematic. In Fig. 10, a vertical line drawn at a time to defined the point where an ideal catalyst (XH2s = 1 all the time) with the same textural properties as the used fresh alumina would deactivate by the complete plugging of pores. It was a good practice to compare results obtained at different operation conditions plotting H zS conversion vs. the dimensionless parameter t/to (breakthrough curves). As shown in Fig. 10, the tested alumina was not an ideal catalyst for the Claus 92 M. Pineda, J.M.

It appears that the model predicted a similar behavior for the two operation conditions. Intrinsically, the behavior of the catalyst was not affected by the concentration of the reactant gases, only the time scale of the process is different. Because, the Claus reaction at low temperature under the test conditions was mostly controlled by intraparticle diffusion, the particle size, presumably, was one of the parameters which most influenced the process. In Fig. 12, the results obtained using a broad range of particle size are shown. As expected, the small particles of alumina (dp = 0.05 mm) exhibited a high catalytic activity for the Claus reaction at low temperature, shown by the sharp decrease of the break- through curve occurring close to t/to = 1. As the particle size increased, the catalytic activity pronouncedly decreased. The largest catalyst particle size (dp = 0.30 mm) showed a small slope breakthrough curve starting to decay long before t/to = 1 and proceeding long after t/to = 1 up to complete deactivation. In Fig. 13, the model predictions using the pore volume Vo as a parameter is shown. The specific surface area has been assumed to be constant although in practice it would be a situation very difficult to achieve by the application of different methods of catalyst preparation. If all the remaining textural properties are kept constant, the increase of the pore volume makes the catalytic activity increase and the corresponding breakthrough curves appear more sharply de- creasing. The pore size was another important parameters which influenced the Claus reaction. 94 M. Pineda, J.M. Palacios /Applied Catalysis A: General 136 (1996) 81-96 XH2S 1 -- Vp =0.20 cm3/g \"..

Intraparticle diffusion was the controlling process of the Claus reaction as opposed to interparticle diffusion along the bed which was less important. In Table 1, the theoretical results obtained for a situation where the Claus reaction at low temperature may find applicability are shown. The composition of the inlet reactant gases was selected for practical interest and the remaining operation conditions are those most frequently used in this study. For a catalyst of small particle size (dp= 0.05-0.10 ram) it was possible to achieve high outlet HzS conversions with high efficiency of the catalytic bed (high bead conversions Xb). However, if the particle size of the catalyst was larger (alp > 0.10 mm) high HzS conversions were only achieved during the first moments when the sulphur deposition was small. Afterwards, the catalyst had to be replaced or regenerated with a very poor efficiency. 4. Conclusions On the basis of the kinetic results using alumina as a catalyst for the Claus reaction at low temperature, the grain model with variable properties was applied to calculate the global reaction rate of a catalyst particle as a function of the mean particle conversion Xs. These data was used to determine the behavior in a fixed bed reactor. The theoretical results agreed reasonably well with the experimental results and, consequently, the model was further used to predict the performance in other conditions of practical interest. It was shown that the Claus reaction in the fixed bed reactor at the test conditions was mostly controlled by intraparticle diffusion and, consequently, pore size and particle diameter were the most important parameters to be considered for the optimiza- tion of the catalyst. High HzS conversions with high efficiencies of the catalyst were only expected with highly porous materials and small particle sizes. 96 Acknowledgements The authors are support. M. Pineda, J.M.

Using a kinetic equation derived from results obtained in a differential reactor, a grain model with variable properties was applied to calculate the global reaction rate for a particle. Furthermore, the theoretical model was developed to explain the performance of alumina as a catalyst for the Claus reaction at low temperature in an integral fixed bed reactor. The results were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The theoretical model was used to study the influence of the most significative parameters involved and to predict the catalyst performance in conditions of practical interest. It was shown that high H2S conversions and efficiencies of the catalyst were to be expected using highly porous materials and small particle sizes. These are the most important parameters for practical utilization. Keywords Alumina Claus reaction Hydrogen sulphide Sulphur References [1] G.R. Schoofs Hydrocarbon Proc. 2 1985 71 [2] D.
