Graphical abstract: Platinum stands as a leading catalyst for oxidation reactions, with its catalytic performance intricately governed by the fine-tuning of its local coordination environment. In this study, we present an effective Na+-decoration strategy to reconstruct the Pt-O coordination microenvironment. Evidenced by experimental characterizations and DFT calculation, the alkali cation of Na+ stabilizes Pt clusters via the Pt-Na-O interaction. Such decoration promotes electron migration from Ce3+-oxygen vacancy to PtOx clusters, preserving of a low Pt-O coordination number (CN) even under oxidative conditions. The Na+-stabilized Pt sites exhibit a 20-fold enhancement in CO oxidation turnover frequency (TOF = 0.39 s-1) compared to Na+-free counterparts (TOF = 0.02 s-1) at 100 °C, attributable to a lowered apparent activation energy (37 vs. 82 kJ/mol). The Na+-decoration also effectively suppresses hydrocarbon adsorption, mitigating hydrocarbon poisoning during CO oxidation. By adopting alkali cations to modulate Pt-O coordination, this strategy may extend to other metals suffering from oxygen overstabilization (e.g., Co/Al2O3, Fe/TiO2), leveraging alkali-induced electron transfer to unlock low M−O coordination.

The electronic properties and surface reactivity of metal species are fundamentally dictated by their metal–oxygen (M−O) coordination microenvironment, establishing M−O interactions as a cornerstone in understanding catalytic behaviors [3,4]. Platinum-oxygen (Pt-O) interactions, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their central role in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, hydrogenation, and environmental remediation [5–8]. Over the years, various strategies have been developed to finely tune the Pt-O coordination environment, such as alloying with other metals, doping with non-metals, engineering support interactions, and controlling particle size and morphology [9–13]. These approaches have deepened our understanding of the structure–activity relationships in Pt-based catalysts, providing key insights into their dynamic behavior under reaction conditions. Despite these advancements, achieving and maintaining a low Pt-O coordination number (CN) under oxidative conditions remains a formidable challenge. This is particularly critical for enhancing catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and durability, as low CN configurations are known to favor the activation of reactants like CO while suppressing undesired side reactions. The catalytic CO oxidation is widely recognized as a model reaction for probing the metal–oxygen structural dynamics due to the characteristic molecular rearrangements mediated by oxygen intermediates [14]. In the prototypical Pt/CeO2 system, Ce4+ ions facilitate the transfer of d orbital electrons from Pt to their 4f orbitals, resulting in positively charged Pt species with a high Pt-O CN [15–18]. Notably, Ke et al. identified that a Pt local structure with a relatively low Pt-O CN is optimally suited for CO oxidation, underscoring the significance of tailored Pt-O interactions for catalytic performance [19]. Traditional methods for reducing the Pt-O CN often rely on reduction pretreatment of the catalyst to destabilize excessive Pt-O coordination [20,21]. However, such reduced metallic Pt species are prone to reoxidation, reverting to high Pt-O CN configurations during prolonged oxidative reactions, thereby compromising catalytic activity and stability. This underscores the critical importance of developing strategies to construct and stabilize active Pt-O sites with intrinsically low Pt-O CN, ensuring consistent high performance in CO oxidation. Hence, advancing such methodologies is pivotal not only for CO oxidation but also for broader applications where metal/oxide suffers from high M−O coordination. The catalytic oxidation of CO has also garnered significant attention due to its critical role in vehicle exhaust purification systems [22–25]. With the continuous advancements in internal combustion engine technologies, exhaust catalysts are increasingly required to exhibit high activity at low temperatures (<150 °C) to meet stringent fuel efficiency and emission standards [26]. In modern engines, the reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions has inadvertently resulted in higher concentrations of CO and hydrocarbons in exhaust gases [27,28]. The presence of hydrocarbons introduces a formidable challenge for Pt-based catalysts, as these species compete with CO for active Pt sites, significantly diminishing catalytic efficiency under low-temperature conditions [29]. This situation highlights the urgent need for exhaust catalysts that not only demonstrate exceptional low-temperature activity for CO oxidation but also possess robust resistance to hydrocarbon inhibition. Addressing this challenge is essential for the development of next-generation catalytic systems capable of meeting both environmental and operational demands in advanced automotive applications. In this study, we developed a Na+-decoration strategy to precisely regulate the Pt-O coordination microenvironment on ceria supports. Integrating catalytic performance evaluations, advanced characterizations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrated the multifaceted roles of alkali cations (Na+) in enhancing CO oxidation catalysis. The Na+-decorated Pt sites exhibited a significantly reduced Pt-O CN, accompanied by an increased CO coverage, which collectively enhanced CO activation. This decoration strategy also facilitated electron transfer from Ce3+-oxygen vacancy (Ov) defects to Pt, enabling the sustained low Pt-O CN even under severe oxidative conditions, thereby markedly improving the stability of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. Additionally, Na+-decoration substantially suppressed hydrocarbon adsorption on Pt active sites, effectively mitigating hydrocarbon poisoning and ensuring superior catalytic performance in CO oxidation. All these findings demonstrate Na+-decoration as a powerful approach for designing robust and efficient catalysts tailored for low-temperature oxidation applications. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation The nanostructured CeO2 support was synthesized via a precipitation method. Specifically, a 40 mL NaOH solution (0.5313 mol/L) was slowly added dropwise to a 30 mL Ce(NO3)3 solution (0.1535 mol/L), followed by stirring for 1 h. The resulting precipitate was thoroughly washed with deionized water three times. Subsequently, the solid was dried at 80 °C for 12 h and calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Pt and Na were loaded onto the CeO2 supports using an incipient wetness co-impregnation method, employing H2PtCl6 and NaNO3 solutions, respectively. The solid was then dried at 60 °C for 5 h and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h, with a heating rate of 2 °C/min in static air. The surplus Na+ that did not contacting with the Pt/CeO2 system was removed by washing with deionized water, after which the catalyst was dried. The Na+-containing Pt/CeO2 catalyst was designated as Pt(Na)/CeO2, while the Na+-free Pt/CeO2 served as a counterpart. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The concentrations of Pt and Na were quantified using PlasmaMS-300 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Nitrogen physisorption measurements were performed on a BETA201B analyzer at −196 °C to determine the specific surface area and pore parameters of the catalysts. Aberration-corrected high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (ac-HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were conducted using a FEI OSIRIS microscope operated at 200 kV, providing detailed insights into the morphological and elemental distribution features of the catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted utilizing a Thermo ESCA Lab-250Xi instrument, operated at a power of 252 W (15 kV and 15 mA). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out on a BRUKER EMX-8/2.7C X-band spectrometer, with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were performed using an AutoChem II 2920 system, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For the TPR analysis, 0.1 g of catalyst was loaded into a fixed-bed reactor and pretreated with a helium flow (30 mL/min) at 200 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the catalyst was exposed to a 5 % H2 in He mixture (30 mL/min) and heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra for the Pt L3-edge in fluorescence mode were obtained at the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The Pt L3-edge spectra in the energy range of 11368–12463 eV were collected for the catalysts. Additionally, Pt foil and PtO2 were tested as references for the Pt L3-edge. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were analyzed using the Demeter software package. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. For the in situ DRIFTS analysis of CO chemisorption, the sample was exposed to a 1 % CO in N2 mixture at a flow rate of 30 mL/min for approximately 30 min. Prior to recording the DRIFTS spectrum, the system was purged with N2 for 5 min to remove any residual gases. The DRIFTS spectrum was then recorded with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-1. For the in situ DRIFTS investigation of CO oxidation, the sample was initially pretreated with a mixture of 1 % CO and 5 % H2 in He at 200 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was purged with the reaction gas to eliminate any extraneous components from the system. The system was subsequently heated to the desired temperature at a rate of 2 °C/min. Before recording the DRIFTS spectrum, the sample was treated with the reaction gas for 5 min to ensure that the adsorption peaks in the IR spectra remained stable. 2.3 Catalytic test and kinetics The CO oxidation reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor containing 50 mg of catalyst, under atmospheric pressure. Before conducting the catalytic evaluation, the synthesized catalysts were activated using a flow of 1 % CO and 5 % H2 in He, and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The CO oxidation light-off performance was assessed at a heating rate of 2 °C/min, with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 150,000 mL/(g·h). The reactive gas mixture comprised 0.4 vol% CO, 10 vol% O2, and the balance was N2. Additionally, 0.1 vol% C3H6 was introduced to evaluate the catalysts’ resistance to hydrocarbon poisoning. The gas composition of the product at the reactor outlet was analyzed using an online gas chromatography system (Agilent 7890B), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) were determined by dividing the CO2 generation rate by the number of active sites, as shown in Eq. (1). The quantity of active sites was calculated based on the total number of Pt atoms present on the ceria surface. (1) TOF = mloes of CO 2 produced per second moles of Pt To minimize the influence of heat and mass transfer effects, the kinetics experiments were conducted with CO conversions maintained below 12 %. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was set at 300,000 mL/(g·h) for Pt(Na)/CeO2 and 150,000 mL/(g·h) for Pt/CeO2, respectively. During the evaluation of reaction orders with respect to CO and O2, kinetic tests were performed under gas flows containing 0.25 ∼ 1.0 % vol. CO and 2.5 ∼ 10 % vol. O2, with the balance being N2. These conditions allowed for a precise assessment of the reaction kinetics and the impact of varying CO and O2 concentrations on the catalytic activity. 2.4 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The spin-polarized electronic structures of all models were calculated using DFT with the projected augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA), parameterized by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), was employed to describe the electronic interactions within our models. The strongly correlated 4f electron of cerium was treated with the DFT + U correction, using a U eff = 5 eV for PBE calculation. Geometric optimization was carried out with an energy cutoff of 450 eV. The optimization criteria were set such that the maximum force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å, and the energy convergence standard was 10-5 eV. CeO2 supercells (4 × 4 × 2) with exposed (111) surfaces were constructed, and a vacuum layer of 15 Å was added to minimize interactions between periodic images. The charge density difference was defined as Δρ = ρ AB − ρ A − ρ B, where ρAB represents the electron density of the slab with adsorbed intermediates, ρ A is the electron density of the isolated slab, and ρ B is the electron density of the isolated intermediates. The adsorption energy (E ad) was calculated using the following equation: (2) E ad = E sub + sur - ( E sub + E sur ) where E sub+sur is the total energy of the surface adsorbed with the substrate, E sur is the energy of the surface without the substrate, and E sub is the energy of the substrate. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Highly active, durable, and antipoisoning performances in CO oxidation The local coordination structure plays a pivotal role in determining catalytic activity. To precisely modulate the electronic state of Pt and tailor its Pt-O coordination structure, alkali cations (Na+) were employed as electronic and structural modifiers [30–32]. Pt and Na were co-deposited on CeO2 supports via an incipient wetness co-impregnation method, with the Na+-free Pt/CeO2 catalyst serving as a benchmark for catalytic performance evaluation. Chlorides were completely removed from the catalyst surface (Fig. S1), ruling out the influence of Cl on the catalytic reaction. A reduction pretreatment was applied to induce the restructuring of Pt sites prior to catalytic assessment. Notably, the reduced Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a significant enhancement in CO oxidation activity (Fig. 1a ). Intriguingly, the oxidized Pt sites stabilized by Na+ were not inherently active for CO oxidation. Despite the inferior overall performance of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 1b), its intrinsic activity, quantified as turnover frequencies (TOFs) per Pt site, was comparable to that of reported Pt cluster catalysts [14,33–35]. The Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a T90 (temperature for 90 % CO conversion) of 92 °C, significantly outperforming Pt/CeO2 (T90 = 245 °C). At 100 °C, the CO conversion rate on Pt(Na)/CeO2 reached 1 × 10-5 molCO·gcat -1·s-1, corresponding to a TOF of 0.39 s-1. This performance is significantly superior to that of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, which achieves a reaction rate of 5.1 × 10-7 molCO·gcat -1·s-1 and a TOF of 0.02 s-1. Impressively, the Na+-stabilized Pt atoms were 20 times more active than their Na+-free counterparts in catalyzing CO oxidation, highlighting the transformative effect of Na+-decoration on Pt site reactivity. The Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst also demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged reaction tests (Fig. 1c) and cycling evaluations (Fig. S2), maintaining its high activity, whereas the catalytic performance of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst progressively deteriorated. Automotive exhaust gases primarily consist of pollutants such as NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons [27,28]. The synthesized catalysts were also tested under simulated exhaust conditions to evaluate their performance. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited only a slight reduction in CO oxidation activity, whereas the catalytic performance of Pt/CeO2 declined dramatically under the same conditions. At 120 °C, the reaction rate on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst was 1 × 10-5 molCO·gcat -1·s-1, corresponding to a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.39 s-1. This performance was significantly superior to that of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, which achieved a reaction rate of 7 × 10-7 molCO·gcat -1·s-1 and a TOF of 0.03 s-1, as well as other noble-metal-based catalysts reported in literatures (Table S1) [23,36]. Both catalysts demonstrated comparable CO oxidation activity when NO gas was individually introduced into the reaction system (Fig. S3). To investigate the inhibitory effects of hydrocarbons, propene (C3H6, 0.1 %) was used as a model hydrocarbon and introduced into the reaction system. Remarkably, the CO oxidation activity of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst plummeted by 76 % in the presence of C3H6 (Fig. 1d), highlighting the susceptibility of Pt/CeO2 to hydrocarbon-induced deactivation. In contrast, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to hydrocarbon poisoning, maintaining stable CO oxidation activity. Kinetic studies were conducted to unravel the intrinsic activity of the synthesized catalysts and to elucidate the promotional role of Na+. By applying the Weisz-Prater and Mears criteria (details provided in the Supplementary Material) [37,38], it was verified that the reaction rates were unaffected by internal or external diffusion limitations. To ensure precise evaluation, CO conversions were maintained below 12 % during the kinetic tests. The apparent activation energy (Ea ) of the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst (37 ± 2 kJ/mol) was significantly lower than that of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (82 ± 3 kJ/mol) (Fig. 1e). This substantial reduction in Ea underscores the Na+-induced modifications in the Pt local coordination structure, which enhanced the activation efficiency of reactants. The CO reaction orders for the Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalysts were determined to be 0.49 and approximately 0 (Fig. 1f), respectively. This marked reduction in the reaction order of CO upon Na+-decoration indicates an enhanced CO coverage on Pt sites, thereby improving CO adsorption and activation on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst. In contrast, the CO oxidation reaction catalyzed by Pt/C exhibited a negative reaction order with respect to CO (Fig. S4a), indicating that an increase in CO concentration led to poisoning of Pt active sites [39], thereby diminishing the catalytic activity. The contrasting behavior in CO reaction orders between Pt/C and Pt/CeO2 systems can be attributed to the role of the catalyst support. Ceria, a prototypical reducible oxide, provides reactive oxygen species (ROS) through lattice oxygen or adsorbed oxygen on vacancies, which participate in the CO oxidation reaction. Consequently, the reaction order of O2 for the Pt/CeO2-catalyzed reaction was approximately zero (Fig. S5), reflecting the abundant supply of ROS to facilitate the reaction with CO adsorbed on Pt sites. This dynamic prevented platinum poisoning, maintaining high catalytic activity. In contrast, the reaction order of O2 for Pt/C catalysts ranged between 0 and 1 (Fig. S4b) [39], indicating a limited capacity of the Pt/C system to supply adequate ROS for CO oxidation. The deficiency of reactive oxygen in the Pt/C system allowed CO adsorption to poison Pt sites, thereby impairing its performance. As for the Pt/CeO2 system, the strategic engineering of Pt local environment to modulate the CO activation is imperative for augmenting CO oxidation activity. 3.2 Pt-O microenvironment characterization and electronic state analysis Electron microscopy images of the Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalysts after air calcination are presented in Fig. 2 . Quantitative analysis of Pt species (Fig. S6) revealed that the oxidized Na+-free Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a sub-cluster morphology of Pt, whereas oxidized single Pt atoms dominated on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst. The Na+ decoration significantly enhanced the dispersion of oxidized Pt species on the ceria surface, possibly attributed to the robust Pt-(O-Na)x interaction [40]. Following reduction treatment, the Pt species on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst maintained their sub-cluster morphology (Fig. S7), while the single-atom Pt on Pt(Na)/CeO2 transformed into sub-cluster structures (Fig. 2d). The mean particle sizes of Pt for the Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalysts were 0.68 ± 0.08 nm and 0.76 ± 0.09 nm, respectively (Fig. S8). The negligible difference in particle size, both being below the 2 nm threshold, suggests that particle size effects on reactivity were not a primary factor [13]. Additionally, the specific surface area of the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst remained stable after reduction treatment (Table S2), underscoring that the observed catalytic enhancements were driven by structural changes in Pt rather than surface area variations. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 2e) revealed higher concentrations of Na dopants near Pt clusters, likely originating from strong interactions between Na+ and PtOx species. In situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption was employed to examine the structural evolution of Pt. Before reduction treatment, CO adsorption bands centered at 2123 cm-1 for Pt/CeO2 and 2099 cm-1 for Pt(Na)/CeO2 corresponded to oxidized Pt clusters and oxidized single-atom Pt, respectively (Fig. S9) [35,41]. The DRIFTS findings aligned with the microscopy results, confirming the Pt dispersion states. Reduction treatment under a flow of 1 % CO and 5 % H2 in He induced a progressive redshift of the CO adsorption bands for Pt sites (Fig. S10a-b). For Pt(Na)/CeO2, the CO adsorption band shifted dramatically (ranging from 1900 to 2000 cm-1), indicating a significantly reduced Pt-O coordination number (CN). After switching to He flow to purge gaseous CO, the reduced Pt/CeO2 exhibited classic metallic Pt0 signatures (2066 ∼ 2090 cm-1) [42]. In contrast, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 sample displayed a novel CO adsorption peak at 2037 cm-1 (Fig. S10c-d), indicative of extremely low Pt-O CN [41–43]. Post-CO oxidation, the Pt/CeO2 catalyst reverted to oxidized Pt clusters (CO adsorption peak at 2122 cm−1). Meanwhile, the low Pt-O CN on Pt(Na)/CeO2 remained stable during the reaction (Fig. 2f). As shown in Pt 4f XPS peak (Fig. S11), the Pt 4f binding energies decreased after Na+-decoration. This electronic shift arose from increased electron density at Pt sites due to Na+-mediated charge transfer from CeO2, which concomitantly reduces the Pt-O CN. These findings demonstrate that Na+ decoration reconstructed and stabilized the Pt coordination microenvironment, thereby significantly enhancing CO oxidation activity. To further probe the electronic structure, Pt L III-edge XANES spectra were obtained for the reaction-spent catalysts. The white-line intensity (Fig. 2g) confirmed the presence of oxidized Pt species on both catalysts and revealed electron transfer between Pt and the ceria support. Notably, Pt atoms on Pt(Na)/CeO2 displayed a reduced cationic nature compared to Pt/CeO2, suggesting that Na+ increased the electron density surrounding Pt. EXAFS analysis confirmed the exclusive Pt-O coordination environment for both catalysts (Fig. 2h). The Pt-O CNs for Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 were 3.7 and 1.9, respectively, with an average Pt-O bond distance of 2.0 Å (Table S3). Wavelet transform (WT) EXAFS (Fig. S12) of Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 display one intensity maximum between 4 and 6 Å-1 in k-space and 1.5 Å in R-space, which corresponds to Pt-O scattering, while no Pt-Pt scattering could be seen in the high-R region (2.5–3.0 Å) at k > 9 Å-1. The combined evidence conclusively demonstrates that Pt exists as oxygen-coordinated monolayer ensembles without Pt-Pt coordination. Unlike conventional three-dimensional platinum oxide clusters with Pt-Pt coordination, the Pt atoms on Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 were solely bridged by oxygen. The absence of long-range Pt-Pt or second-shell Pt-O features a monolayer Pt structure. XPS of Na 1 s further demonstrated shifts in the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst after reduction treatment (Fig. S13), indicating interactions between Na+ and the catalyst. This interaction likely occurred via oxygen within PtOx clusters or the ceria support, further contributing to the observed catalytic enhancements. 3.3 Electronic migration/regulation mechanism The Na+ modification introduced profound changes in the electronic structure and surface chemistry of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, as elucidated by in situ DRIFTS and XAFS spectroscopy. These advanced characterizations revealed that Na+ significantly mitigates the cationic nature of Pt and reduces the Pt-O CN, suggesting that Na+ either inhibits electron transfer from Pt to the ceria support or promotes reverse electron flow from ceria to Pt. While the precise mechanism of this modulation remains to be fully elucidated, it presents a compelling avenue for future research. The defect characteristics and electronic states of the ceria support were investigated using XPS and EPR spectroscopy. Formation of oxygen vacancies (VO) on the CeO2 surface led to the generation of Ce3+ species as excess electrons localized on neighboring Ce4+ cations. In the XPS Ce 3d spectra (Fig. 3a ), among the ten deconvoluted peaks, the ν0 (881 eV), ν′ (884.4 eV), μ0 (898.5 eV), and μ′ (902.3 eV) peaks were indicative of Ce3+, while the remaining peaks corresponded to Ce4+ species [44,45]. The Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+) ratio for the Na+-decorated Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst was significantly lower (0.212) compared to the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (0.276), implying reduced surface defect concentration. Similarly, in the XPS O 1 s spectra (Fig. 3b), peaks at 529.3 eV, 531.7 eV, and 533.2 eV were assigned to lattice oxygen (Oα), adsorbed oxygen on surface oxygen vacancies (Oβ), and adsorbed water (Oγ), respectively [46,47]. The Oβ/(Oα + Oβ + Oγ) ratio for Pt(Na)/CeO2 (0.242) was markedly lower than that for Pt/CeO2 (0.338), confirming a significant reduction in oxygen vacancies. These results collectively indicate that Na+ modification substantially diminishes the Ce3+-OV defect sites, thereby altering the electronic landscape of the catalyst. The EPR profile (Fig. 3c) further supported this observation, displaying a characteristic signal at a g-value of 1.96, corresponding to defect-associated Ce3+-OV species [48,49]. The weaker resonance intensity observed for Pt(Na)/CeO2 signifies a lower concentration of Ce3+-OV defects. The introduction of alkali cations facilitated enhanced electron transfer from oxygen defects, reducing the Ce3+-OV site density and promoting electron migration toward Pt. This phenomenon effectively lowered the Pt-O CN and stabilized the local Pt-O environment under oxidative conditions. The reducibility of surface oxygen species was examined using H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 3d). The reduction peaks observed within the temperature ranges of 50 ∼ 200 °C, 200 ∼ 600 °C, and 600 ∼ 800 °C corresponded to the reduction of oxygen species near Pt (Pt-O-Ce structure), surface Ce4+, and bulk CeO2, respectively [23,50]. For the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction peak of the Pt-O-Ce structure shifted from 192 °C to 153 °C with decreased intensity, indicating a weakened Pt-O-Ce interaction and a reduced Pt-O CN. Concurrently, the reduction temperature of surface Ce4+ was elevated, potentially due to accelerated electron transfer from ceria to Pt, which decreased the reducibility of Ce4+. In conventional Pt/CeO2 systems, electron transfer from Pt to ceria promotes rapid lattice oxygen migration from ceria to oxidized Pt atoms [8,18], resulting in a high Pt-O CN at Pt-O-Ce sites. The formation of Pt-O-Ce sites could overstabilize the surface lattice oxygen and hinder the CO oxidation acitivity. However, the presence of Na+ reorients the electron transfer dynamics, redirecting electrons from Ce3+-OV defects to PtOx sites. This redistribution reduces the Pt oxidation state and Pt-O CN (Fig. 3e), leading to enhanced CO oxidation performance. The observed decrease in Pt-O CN in the Na+ modified subnanometric PtOx/CeO2 catalyst underscores the critical role of alkali cation-induced electronic modulation in optimizing catalytic activity. 3.4 Insight into the reason of improved durable and antipoisoning ability During the catalytic stability test, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining nearly constant activity, which attests to its robust structural integrity. In contrast, the Pt/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a progressive decline in activity. To elucidate the nature and evolution of supported Pt species during CO oxidation, in situ DRIFTS was employed. The catalysts were pre-reduced under a mixed flow of CO and H2 in He. Once CO saturation on the catalyst surface was achieved, the gas flow was switched to O2 to assess the reactivity of the adsorbed CO intermediates. The results (Fig. 4a ) revealed that with increasing temperature, the metallic Pt0 sites (2066 cm-1) on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst gradually shifted to higher wavenumbers (2117 cm-1), indicative of the formation of more oxidized Pt species, characterized by a strong Pt-O-Ce bond. The absence of CO2 formation underscored the inferior catalytic activity of the oxidized Pt species (Fig. S14a). The transformation of the electronic and oxidation states of Pt within the local structure of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst was responsible for the observed decrease in activity during the stability test. In the case of the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst, the CO adsorption peak at 2038 cm-1, attributed to Pt sites with low Pt-O coordination number (CN), disappeared at 50 °C (Fig. 4b), highlighting the superior low-temperature activity of the Na+-stabilized Pt local structure. Within this Pt coordination environment, an oxygen atom may bond with multiple Pt atoms, leading to the formation of Pt-O-Pt units, as evidenced by the CO adsorption peak (2081 cm-1) [14]. These Pt-O-Pt sites exhibited exceptional performance in CO oxidation, with the CO adsorption peak vanishing at 80 °C. The Pt sites on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst remained unchanged throughout CO oxidation, emphasizing its remarkable stability. The Na+-decoration significantly enhanced the resistance of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst to hydrocarbon poisoning during CO oxidation. To systematically assess the inhibitory impact of hydrocarbons on CO oxidation, C3H6 was introduced into the reaction system during the in situ DRIFTS of CO oxidation. As shown in Figs. 4c-d, the adsorption peaks in the range of 2800 ∼ 3200 cm-1, corresponding to the C–H stretching bands of C3H6, were observed [51]. In the absence of C3H6, no such C–H stretching peaks were detected (Fig. S14). Notably, the intensity of the C–H stretching bands was significantly diminished on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst relative to the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, indicating the Na+-induced enhanced resistance to hydrocarbon poisoning. The weak C3H6 adsorption on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst aligns with its improved CO oxidation activity. With increasing reaction temperature, the low-coordinated Pt-O sites on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst evolved into higher oxidation state Pt sites, which favored C3H6 adsorption [29,51,52]. In contrast, the Na+-stabilized low-coordinated Pt-O sites on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst remained stable, exhibiting only weak C3H6 adsorption throughout the reaction. The transformation of the Pt-O local coordination environment on the Pt/CeO2 catalyst facilitated enhanced C3H6 adsorption, which contributed to the deactivation of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. The reduced C3H6 adsorption on Na+-modified Pt sites stems from two interconnected mechanisms. On the one hand, the Na+-induced increment in Pt d-band filling reduces the availability of unoccupied d-band states (particularly near the Fermi level) for accepting electrons from propylene’s π orbitals. This weakens propylene’s capacity as an electron donor, consequently reducing propylene adsorption and enhancing the catalyst’s tolerance to propylene. On the other hand, the increased electron density around Pt concurrently enhances CO adsorption through strengthened σ/π-interactions. This elevated CO coverage competitively displaces C3H6 from active sites due to preferential adsorption thermodynamics. 3.5 Identification of Na+-stabilized Pt local structure and its superior performance To verify the alterations in the Pt-O coordination environment induced by Na+ modification, DFT calculations were conducted [53]. For the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, a monolayer Pt6O8 structure was modeled on the CeO2(111) surface (Fig. 5a ), constructed based on EXAFS data and the Pt particle size. In this configuration, Pt atoms were exclusively bridged by oxygen within their first coordination shell. Specifically, four Pt atoms were coordinated in a square-planar Pt-O4 arrangement, while two Pt atoms exhibited a trigonal planar Pt-O3 coordination geometry. For the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst, three Na atoms were incorporated into a triangular Pt6O3 model on the CeO2(111) surface (Fig. 5b), in line with the Pt to Na molar ratio of 2:1 (as confirmed by ICP-MS, Supplementary Table 3). In this structure, one Pt atom was coordinated in a Pt-O3 configuration, while the remaining Pt atoms adopted a Pt-O2 coordination geometry. The bond analysis was proceeded to reveal the role of Na+ as a geometric modulator (Fig. S15). The optimized Pt(Na)/CeO2 structure showed that Na+ bridges Pt and O in ceria via shortened Na-O bonds (2.18 ± 0.05 Å vs. 2.57 Å in isolated Na/CeO2). The Pt-Na interaction elongated adjacent Pt-O bonds to 2.05 ± 0.03 Å (vs. 1.96 ± 0.02 Å in Pt/CeO2). This geometric reorganization directly weakened Pt-O overstabilization, reducing the Pt-O CN. According to the density of states (DOS) generated from DFT model system (Fig. S16), the Na s and Pt p states coincided in the band gap, further proving the existence of Pt-Na interaction. Combined with the shortened Na-O bond in optimized Pt(Na)/CeO2 structure, the Na+ interacted with Pt clusters via the Pt-Na-O species. Differential charge density analyses revealed notable differences in the electronic properties between the two catalysts. For the Pt/CeO2 catalyst (Fig. 5c and Fig. S17a), Pt sites were inclined to lose electrons, resulting in increased electron density on the ceria surface oxygen atoms adjacent to the Pt atoms. In contrast, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst displayed higher electron density around the Pt sites, with electron depletion observed on the ceria surface (Fig. 5d and Fig. S17b). The Na+ modification effectively altered the electron transfer dynamics, thereby modifying the local microenvironment of the Pt-O coordination. The calculated CO adsorption wavenumbers for Pt-O3 and Pt-O4 sites on Pt/CeO2 were in the range of 2120 ∼ 2130 cm-1, closely matching the experimental values obtained from in situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption (Fig. S18). The agreement between the calculated and experimental CO adsorption wavenumbers below 2040 cm-1 (Fig. S19) further confirmed the Na+-induced low Pt-O coordination structure. A comprehensive analysis incorporating HAADF-STEM, ICP-MS, XANES, EXAFS, XPS, and in situ DRIFTS of C-O vibrational frequencies supported the theoretical predictions of the Pt structure. These characterization techniques provided key insights into Pt size, chemical valence, and coordination environment, which established the baseline for further interpretation. To assess the influence of Na+ modification on catalytic performance, the adsorption energies of CO molecules on Pt sites of both Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalysts were calculated. For the Pt/CeO2 catalyst, the adsorption energies of CO on the Pt-O4 and Pt-O3 sites were determined to be −0.43 eV and −1.12 eV, respectively. The predominance of the Pt-O4 site in Pt/CeO2 led to weaker CO adsorption, thereby diminishing the CO oxidation activity. In contrast, the Pt-O3 and Pt-O2 sites on the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited CO adsorption energies of −1.48 eV and −1.79 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. S20, the reduction in Pt-O CN enhanced CO adsorption, leading to increased surface coverage of CO on Pt sites. This result was consistent with kinetic testing, which showed a decrease in the reaction order of CO with Na+ modification. The absolute CO adsorption energy on Pt sites remained below −2 eV, indicating that CO poisoning was not a significant factor. The kinetic pathway for CO oxidation steps was analyzed (Fig. S21). On Pt/CeO2 and Pt(Na)/CeO2, CO oxidation was predicted to follow the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, where adsorbed CO on the Pt atom reacted with surface lattice oxygen in ceria. O2 dissociation would heal the oxygen vacancy sites to complete the catalytic cycle. In comparison with Pt/CeO2, the Pt(Na)/CeO2 catalyst exhibited a larger free energy decrease for the CO oxidation reaction, indicating a greater thermodynamic tendency for the reaction to occur. The decrease in apparent activation energy indicates that the Na+-modification reconstructs the Pt-O coordination microenvironment, making the reaction kinetically more favorable. In summary, from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives, the Na+-modification facilitates the CO oxidation on Pt/CeO2. 4 Conclusion In this study, we present a highly effective Na+-decoration strategy to precisely modulate the Pt-O local coordination environment, resulting in significant improvements in catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to poisoning for CO oxidation. The incorporation of alkali cations (Na+) induces a structural transformation of Pt single atoms into more catalytically active Pt clusters, characterized by an ultra-low Pt-O CN, achieved through a reduction pretreatment. A comprehensive suite of characterizations, along with DFT calculations, demonstrated that Na+ facilitates electronic transfer from Ce3+-OV defects to PtOx sites, thereby stabilizing the low CN Pt-O microenvironment under prolonged oxidative conditions. This innovative approach not only stabilizes Pt sites with low Pt-O coordination but also enhances CO adsorption, leading to improved CO oxidation performance. Additionally, it effectively mitigates hydrocarbon poisoning, addressing a key challenge in low-temperature (< 200 °C) CO oxidation catalyzed by Pt-based systems. The significant electronic transfer effect induced by Na+ underscores its broader applicability, providing a strategy for alleviating oxygen over-stabilization at metal-support interfaces. These findings offer valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts with enhanced reactivity, stability, and resistance to poisoning, paving the way for advancements in heterogeneous catalysis.

        "dc:description": "Platinum stands as a leading catalyst for oxidation reactions, with its catalytic performance intricately governed by the fine-tuning of its local coordination environment. In this study, we present an effective Na+-decoration strategy to reconstruct the Pt-O coordination microenvironment. Evidenced by experimental characterizations and DFT calculation, the alkali cation of Na+ stabilizes Pt clusters via the Pt-Na-O interaction. Such decoration promotes electron migration from Ce3+-oxygen vacancy to PtOx clusters, preserving of a low Pt-O coordination number (CN) even under oxidative conditions. The Na+-stabilized Pt sites exhibit a 20-fold enhancement in CO oxidation turnover frequency (TOF = 0.39 s-1) compared to Na+-free counterparts (TOF = 0.02 s-1) at 100 °C, attributable to a lowered apparent activation energy (37 vs. 82 kJ/mol). The Na+-decoration also effectively suppresses hydrocarbon adsorption, mitigating hydrocarbon poisoning during CO oxidation. By adopting alkali cations to modulate Pt-O coordination, this strategy may extend to other metals suffering from oxygen overstabilization (e.g., Co/Al2O3, Fe/TiO2), leveraging alkali-induced electron transfer to unlock low M−O coordination.",
