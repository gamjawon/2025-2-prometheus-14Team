Graphical abstract Direct hydrogenation of CO2 into high value−added chemicals and fuels has received great attention in recent years. However, highly selective synthesis of single aromatic product by one−step CO2 hydrogenation is still a big challenge. Herein, we designed a ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 tandem catalyst which realized the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products up to 96 % and the selectivity of tetramethylbenzene(TeMB) in aromatics up to 83 % in the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation. We found that the organic base TBAOH is more favorable for the generation of uniform mesopores in ZSM-11 compared to TPAOH, thus increasing the selectivity of aromatics and TeMB. In addition, the secondary acid treatment mainly removes the extra−framework Al(EFAl) species produced by the alkali treatment, which significantly increases the relative amount of the strong Brønsted acid, thus facilitating further increase in the selectivity of aromatics and TeMB.

Converting CO2 into high value−added chemicals and fuels can not only reduce CO2 emissions, but also produce chemicals that used to be produced from fossil resources. Therefore, the resource utilization of CO2 has received more and more attention. With the help of green hydrogen produced from renewable energy, it has been reported that the production of high value−added aromatics through CO2 hydrogenation using the tandem catalyst [4], but synthesis of the single aromatic product with high selectivity is still a big challenge due to the complex distribution of aromatic products ranging from C6 to C11+ [5]. Tetramethylbenzene(TeMB) is an important chemical product which can be used in the following two aspects, one is used as fuel, that is, as the precursor to produce aviation kerosene, and the other is used as the raw material to produce fine chemicals such as pyromellitic dianhydride [6–8]. If highly selective synthesis of the single aromatic product TeMB by CO2 hydrogenation could be realized, it will be of great significance to the resource utilization of CO2. ZnZrO has been proven to highly selective synthesis of methanol by CO2 hydrogenation [9], and ZSM-11 has also been proven to be beneficial for the synthesis of trimethylbenzene(TMB) and TeMB in the methanol to aromatic(MTA) reaction [10]. Due to the similar reaction conditions of the above two reactions, it has been successfully demonstrated that the ZnZrO/ZSM-11 tandem catalyst could achieve the synthesis of TeMB by CO2 hydrogenation [11]. The modification of zeolites has been proven to be the effective way to increase the selectivity of single aromatic product over tandem catalyst [12–14]. There are two main factors affecting the catalytic performance of zeolites, one is the pore channel, and the other is the acid property [15,16]. It is reasonable to modify ZSM-11 to further increase the selectivity of TeMB from the two aspects. The desilication treatment by alkali is one of the most effective methods to create mesopores, and it has attracted much attention due to its low cost and simple operation [17,18]. The most commonly used reagent for desilication is the inorganic base NaOH. Compared with NaOH, organic base can effectively control the rate and degree of desilication, making desilication controllable [19,20]. Dai et al. modified ZSM-5 with organic base TPAOH solution at high temperature and obtained regular mesoporous ZSM-5, which increased the conversion of biphenyl and the selectivity of 4−methylbiphenyl in the methylation reaction of biphenyl and methanol [21]. Wan et al. modified ZSM-5 with NaOH and TPAOH mixed solution and investigated its performance in the methanol to hydrocarbon(MTH) reaction, they found the increased mesoporosity, crystallinity and surface integrity for the desilicated ZSM-5 after TPAOH introduction, and the lifetime was also extended for the desilicated ZSM-5 in the MTH reaction [22]. The existence of Al species is the main origin for the acidity of zeolite. Dealumination with acid is a common method to change the acid property of zeolite [23]. Meng et al. investigated the catalytic performance of HF acid−modified ZSM-5 zeolite for the methanol to gasoline(MTG) reaction, the results showed that framework Al species were removed to a certain extent, and the acid property and pore channel of ZSM-5 were effectively adjusted, which improved the stability and catalytic performance of ZSM-5 in the MTG reaction [24]. According to the literature, we anticipate that the modification of ZSM-11 with desilication and dealumination would be the effective method to further improve the catalytic performance of ZnZrO/ZSM-11 tandem catalyst. This may help to achieve the goal of highly selective synthesis of TeMB by CO2 hydrogenation. In this work, we used the mixed organic−inorganic base to modify the pore channels of ZSM-11 by desilication and nitric acid to modify the acid property of ZSM-11 by dealumination. For the hydrogenation of CO2 over the ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 tandem catalyst, the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products reached up to 96 %, and the selectivity of TeMB in aromatics reached up to 83 % at the CO2 conversion of about 9 %. We found that TBAOH is more conducive to the removal of Si species than TPAOH, thus facilitating the formation of uniform mesopores in ZSM-11, so the selectivities of total aromatics and TeMB are increased. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the secondary acid treatment mainly removes the extra−framework Al(EFAl) species, which significantly increases the relative amount of the strong Brønsted acid, thus facilitating further increase in the selectivity of aromatics and TeMB. 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation Fig. 1 shows the representative results of ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 tandem catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The ZSM-11 zeolite was modified by different methods to obtain ZSM-11(HN), ZSM-11(TP), ZSM-11(TB), ZSM-11(HN,TB) and ZSM-11(TB,HN) (Details seen the catalyst preparation part in the supporting information). Fig. 1 A and B shows the catalytic performance of different ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 catalysts. Compared with the parent ZSM-11, the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB of ZSM-11(HN) are increased. For ZSM-11(TP), the selectivity of aromatics in hydrocarbons reaches 76 % and TeMB in aromatics reaches 79 %, while those of ZSM-11(TB) both reach 81 %. The catalytic performance of ZSM-11(HN,TB) is close to that of ZSM-11(TB), indicating that the acid modification before alkali treatment can not significantly improve the catalytic performance. ZSM-11(TB,HN) shows the best catalytic performance, the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB are both up to 83 % when the conversion of CO2 is about 9 %. This indicates that the acid modification after the alkali treatment can further improve the catalytic performance. In order to exclude the effect of systematic errors, the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB with error bars are shown in Fig. S1. It shows that it is the different modification methods lead to the differences in the catalyst performances. Due to the fact that the C1-C4 gaseous hydrocarbons do not need to be separated from aromatic products, so only the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products needs to be considered. As shown in Fig. 1C, compared with the parent ZSM-11, the catalytic performance of ZSM-11(TB,HN) is significantly improved. For the ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TB,HN) catalyst, the selectivity of liquid products in total hydrocarbons reaches 86 %, the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products reaches up to 96 %, and the selectivity of TeMB in liquid products reaches up to 80 %. Therefore, the ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TB,HN) catalyst can realize the highly selective synthesis of the single aromatic product TeMB. Fig. 1D shows that the catalyst is not obviously deactivated after the reaction for 100 h. Moreover, the results of the reaction condition optimization indicate that low temperature, high pressure, and appropriate space velocity are favorable for the synthesis of aromatics and TeMB (Fig. S2). 2.2 The thermodynamic calculations of CO2 hydrogenation to aromatics In order to investigate the effect of the reaction temperature on the distribution of CO2 hydrogenation products, we applied the thermodynamics analysis and calculated the ΔG for the formation of the main products in the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation. Fig. 2 shows the Gibbs free energy of products over the temperature range from 0 to 500 °C during CO2 hydrogenation. The ΔG for the formation of different products significantly changes with the reaction temperature, indicating that thermodynamics has significant influence on the product distribution. It can also be found that low reaction temperature is beneficial for the production of aromatics, however, low reaction temperature leads to the extension of the induction period for the formation of the hydrocarbon pool (HCP) species [25]. So it is important to choose the appropriate reaction temperature. Fig. 1 A and B shows that the main byproduct is CO for the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation to TeMB. Assuming only two reactions occur: The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and CO2 hydrogenation to TeMB. The equilibrium conversion of CO2 almost reaches over 80 % and the equilibrium selectivity of TeMB reaches about 100 % under the tested conditions (Fig. S3). This indicates that the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation to TeMB is thermodynamically favorable. 2.3 The physicochemical properties of the ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 tandem catalysts 20 %ZnZrO was chosen as one component of the tandem catalyst. ZnZrO just presents the characteristic diffraction peaks of t-ZrO2, so ZnZrO is in solid solution structure (Fig. S4 and S5) [9]. The ZnZrO/ZSM-11 tandem catalyst was fabricated by physically mixing ZnZrO with ZSM-11, and the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnZrO solid solution and ZSM-11 zeolite are kept (Fig. S4). The TEM pictures show that the morphologies of the alkali treated samples are significantly different from those of the parent ZSM-11 and ZSM-11(HN), which can be due to the desilication caused by the alkali treatment (Fig. S6). The SEM pictures show that ZSM-11 zeolites exist mainly in the form of spherical particles of several hundred nanometers (Fig. S7), and these spherical particles are composed of smaller nanocrystals (Fig. S8). Fig. 3 A shows the typical XRD patterns of the parent and the modified ZSM-11 zeolites. All the samples present two typical characteristic diffraction peaks of MEL topological structure in the range of 2θ = 22.5°−25°, corresponding to the [501] and [303] crystal planes [26]. The relative crystallinity (compared to the parent ZSM-11) of ZSM-11 were estimated from the intensities of the [501] and [303] crystal planes, and the relative crystallinity of the parent ZSM-11 was defined as 100 %. The information about the relative crystallinity and Si/Al ratio of the parent and modified ZSM-11 is listed in Table 1 . The relative crystallinity and Si/Al ratio of ZSM-11(HN) increase compared to the parent ZSM-11, indicating that the extra−framework Al(EFAl) species exist in the parent ZSM-11. The removal of the EFAl species after the acid treatment leads to the increase in the Si/Al ratio and the relative crystallinity [16]. The Si/Al ratio and relative crystallinity of ZSM-11 treated with different alkali solutions decrease to different degrees, indicating that TBAOH is more conducive to the removal of Si species than TPAOH. In addition, the relative crystallinity of ZSM-11(HN,TB) is higher than that of ZSM-11(TB), indicating that the secondary alkali treatment of ZSM-11(HN) does not lead to the obvious destruction of the ZSM-11 framework. The Si/Al ratio of ZSM-11(TB,HN) increases significantly, much higher than that of ZSM-11(TB), indicating that after the alkali treatment, a large number of easily removed Al species are produced, which are removed after the secondary acid treatment, resulting in the significant increase in the Si/Al ratio. In addition, the relative crystallinity of ZSM-11(TB,HN) is slightly lower than that of ZSM-11(TB), it indicates that some framework Al(FAl) species exist in these easily removed Al species. After the secondary acid treatment of ZSM-11(TB), these easily removed FAl species are removed, which leads to the further destruction of ZSM-11 framework, resulting in the lowest relative crystallinity of ZSM-11(TB, HN). Fig. 3B shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the parent and the modified ZSM-11 zeolites. The two peaks at 54 ppm and 0 ppm corresponding to the tetrahedral FAl species and EFAl species, respectively [27]. It can be found that both FAl and EFAl species exist in all samples. The relative contents of FAl and EFAl species of the samples are estimated from the integrated peak intensities in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Table S1). It can be found that the relative contents of EFAl species in the post acid treated samples ZSM-11(HN) and ZSM-11(TB,HN) decrease compared to the parent ZSM-11 and ZSM-11(TB). The relative contents of EFAl species in the alkali treated samples ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) increase to different degrees compared to the parent ZSM-11. It indicates that desilication of ZSM-11 by the alkali treatment leads to the generation of a large number of easily removed Al species which are mainly composed of EFAl species, while the acid treatment can effectively remove EFAl species. The results of N2 physisorption experiment are shown in Fig. S9A. The parent and the modified ZSM-11 present the both types I and IV adsorption isotherms. The hysteresis loops in the range of p/p 0 = 0.4−1.0 indicate that both micropores and mesopores exist in these samples [28]. The adsorption isotherms of ZSM-11(HN) and the parent ZSM-11 are similar, indicating the presence of similar pore channels in the two samples. The hysteresis loop of ZSM-11(TB) is more obvious than that of ZSM-11(TP), indicating that more obvious mesopores exist in ZSM-11(TB). The hysteresis loop of ZSM-11(HN,TB) in the range of p/p 0 = 0.4−0.9 is smaller than that of ZSM-11(TB), however, another obvious hysteresis loop in the range of p/p 0 = 0.9−1.0 exists in ZSM-11(HN,TB), indicating the existence of larger pores. The XRD results have proved that the acid treatment mainly removes the EFAl species in the parent ZSM-11. After removal of these EFAl species, the secondary alkali treatment leads to the significantly increase in the adsorption capacity of larger pores. Based on the previous literature results [29,30], it can be speculated that the existence of the EFAl species could prevent the generation of larger pores by regulating the desilication process. After removal of the EFAl species by acid treatment, the Si species near these EFAl species are preferentially and uncontrollably removed during alkali treatment, resulting in the generation of larger pores. The hysteresis loop of ZSM-11(TB,HN) is similar with that of ZSM-11(TB), indicating that the secondary acid treatment does not lead to the significant change in the pore channels of ZSM-11(TB). The BJH pore size distributions obtained from the adsorption isotherm branches indicate that the pore size distributions of the parent ZSM-11 and ZSM-11(HN) are mainly concentrated below 2 nm (Fig. S9B). Compared to ZSM-11(TP), the pore size distribution of ZSM-11(TB) is more concentrated, indicating that TBAOH is more conducive to the generation of 2−10 nm uniform mesopores in ZSM-11 compared to TPAOH. The pore size distributions of ZSM-11(HN,TB) are between 2−10 nm and above 30 nm, indicating the coexistence of the small−sized uniform mesopores and larger pores. The pore size distribution of ZSM-11(TB,HN) is similar to that of ZSM-11(TB), indicating that the secondary acid treatment does not significantly change the pore size distribution of ZSM-11(TB). Table 1 also lists the information about the textural properties of the parent and the modified ZSM-11. Compared with the parent ZSM-11, the surface area and pore volume of ZSM-11(HN) slightly increase, but the changes are not obvious, indicating that the acid treatment does not significantly change the textural property of ZSM-11. The external surface area and mesopore volume of ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) both increase significantly, indicating that the alkali treatment can effectively create mesopores in ZSM-11. In addition, TBAOH is more conducive to the generation of mesopores than TPAOH. Compared to ZSM-11(TB), ZSM-11(HN,TB) shows smaller external surface area and larger mesopore volume, indicating that larger pores exist in ZSM-11(HN,TB). The external surface area and mesopore volume of ZSM-11(TB,HN) are close to those of ZSM-11(TB), indicating the similar textural properties of ZSM-11(TB) and ZSM-11(TB,HN). From the above experimental results, it can be concluded as follows: the acid treatment can remove the EFAl species without significantly changing the pore channels of ZSM-11. The alkali treatment can effectively create mesopores in ZSM-11 by desilication, and TBAOH is more conducive to the generation of uniform mesopores than TPAOH. The secondary alkali treatment after the acid treatment leads to the generation of larger pores, which may be due to the lack of EFAl species regulating the desilication process. Although the secondary acid treatment after the alkali treatment leads to the significant removal of EFAl species, the secondary acid treatment does not obviously change the mesoporous pore channels produced after the alkali treatment. 2.4 The acid properties of the modified ZSM-11 zeolites Fig. 4 A shows the NH3−TPD profiles of the parent and the modified ZSM-11 zeolites. The desorption peaks of NH3 at 100−250 °C, 250−400 °C, and 400−600 °C are attributed to the weak, medium, and strong acid amount of ZSM-11 zeolite, respectively [22,31]. The results of the quantitative estimation of the acid amount are shown in Table 2 . It has been proposed that the Lewis acid sites produced by the EFAl species are the main reason for the generation of the weak acid sites [32]. The strong acid sites related with FAl species have important catalytic effects [33,34], and they are the main active sites used to study the relationship between the acid property and aromatization [35]. Compared with the parent ZSM-11, the amount of the weak acid of ZSM-11(HN) decreases, which can be due to the acid treatment removes the EFAl species of ZSM-11, resulting in the decrease of the amount of the weak acid. According to the catalytic performance in Fig. 1A, the increase in the aromatic selectivity indicates that the weak acid sites are not active sites for aromatization reaction, the reduction of the weak acid amount leads to the increase in the relative amount of strong acid, which promotes the formation of aromatics. Compared with the parent ZSM-11, the moderate and strong acid amount of ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) increases, which is due to the removal of Si species from ZSM-11 framework and the formation of new moderate and strong Si−OH−Al acid sites on the external surface of ZSM-11 [36,37], thus resulting in the obvious decrease of the relative crystallinity but only small changes in the Si/Al ratio (Table 1). In addition, the acid amount of ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) is very close, indicating that the difference in the catalytic performance is not due to the difference in the acid amount. The acid amount of ZSM-11(HN,TB) is close to that of ZSM-11(TB), with only slight decrease in the weak acid amount. This is due to the removal of the EFAl species after the first acid treatment. Compared to ZSM-11(TB), ZSM-11(TB,HN) shows significant decrease in the weak and moderate acid amount, this is due to the removal of a large number of EFAl and some FAl species after the secondary acid treatment (Fig. 3A and B), resulting in the significant increase in the relative amount of the strong acid. Fig. 4B shows the pyridine adsorption FTIR(Py−FTIR) profiles of the parent and the modified ZSM-11 zeolites. The peaks at 1545 cm−1 and 1454 cm−1 belong to pyridine interacting with Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively [35]. It can be found that the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites exist in all samples. The results of B/L ratio of all the samples are shown in Table 2. Compared with the parent ZSM-11, the increase in the B/L ratio of ZSM-11(HN) indicates that the decreased weak acid sites in the NH3−TPD result are mainly Lewis acid sites produced by EFAl species [32]. The B/L ratios of ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) are the same and higher than that of the parent ZSM-11. After the alkali treatment, the B/L ratios increase, while the main increases in the acid amount are the moderate and strong acid, indicating that these newly added Brønsted acid sites are the main contributors to the moderate and strong acid sites. Strong acid sites are the main active sites for the MTA reaction [35], so the increase in the number of the strong Brønsted acid sites may be one of the reasons for the increased selectivity of aromatics. The two main factors affecting the catalytic performance of zeolites are the pore channel and the acid property [15]. Due to the similar acid properties of ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB), it can be concluded as follows: the reason for the difference in the catalytic performance between ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) is the difference in the pore channels, that is, the increase in the mesoporosity leads to the increase in the aromatics selectivity. This may be due to the generation of uniform mesopores is beneficial to the diffusion of large aromatic intermediate species, which increases the accessibility of the active sites to these species [38,39]. The B/L ratio of ZSM-11(HN,TB) is slightly higher than that of ZSM-11(TB), this is due to the removal of EFAl species in the first acid treatment. Compared with ZSM-11(TB), the B/L ratio of ZSM-11(TB,HN) increases and the amount of the weak and moderate acid decreases (Table 2), which is due to the removal of the easily removed Al species produced by the first alkali treatment. After the secondary acid treatment, these Al species are removed, leading to the significant increase in the B/L ratio. The results of Py−FTIR and NH3−TPD show that the acid treatment can effectively remove the weak Lewis acid sites in ZSM-11 zeolite. Considering the results of XRD, XRF and 27Al MAS NMR, it can be demonstrated that the weak Lewis acid sites are mainly provided by the EFAl species. The results of N2 physisorption experiment have proved that similar pore channels exist in ZSM-11(TB) and ZSM-11(TB,HN). Therefore, the main reason for the different catalytic performance of ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TB) and ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TB,HN) is the different acid property. Xu et al. proposed that the removal of EFAl species increased the number of catalytically active framework Brønsted acid sites [40]. Based on this, it can be concluded as follows: The weak Lewis acid sites provided by the EFAl species are not the active sites for the aromatization reaction. The removal of these EFAl species significantly increases the relative amount of the strong Brønsted acid with catalytic activity, which increases the accessibility of the reacting molecules to these active sites. We believe this is the most important reason for the increased aromatic selectivity of ZSM-11(TB,HN). Fig. 5 shows the 2,6−ditertbutylpyridine adsorption FTIR(2,6−dTBPy−FTIR) profiles of the parent and the modified ZSM-11 zeolites. The relative amount of the external Brønsted acid was estimated from the integral intensity of the band at 1615 cm−1 [41]. The relative amount of the external Brønsted acid of the parent ZSM-11 was defined as 100 %. It can be found that the amount of the external Brønsted acid of ZSM-11 treated with acid decreases to different degrees. In contrast, the amount of the external Brønsted acid of the alkali treated ZSM-11(TP) and ZSM-11(TB) increases. According to the previous results, it has been demonstrated that the external Brønsted acid sites are the important active sites for the alkylation reaction, which are of great importance for the increased selectivity of TeMB [11]. It can also be used to explain the catalytic performance in Fig. 1A, that is, the TeMB selectivity of ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TB) is higher than that of ZnZrO/ZSM-11(TP), which is due to the existence of more external Brønsted acid amount in ZSM-11(TB). In addition, the main reason for the increased external Brønsted acid amount of ZSM-11(TB) is the increased external surface area. Interestingly, it can be found that even ZSM-11(TB,HN) with less external Brønsted acid amount, the selectivity of TeMB is still higher than that of ZSM-11(TB) with more external Brønsted acid amount, indicating that the external Brønsted acid amount is not the only factor affecting the synthesis of TeMB. Combined with the results of NH3−TPD, it can be found that although the external Brønsted acid amount of ZSM-11(TB,HN) decreases, the strong acid amount does not change obviously. This indicates that the decreased external Brønsted acid of ZSM-11(TB,HN) is mainly weak and moderate acid, and a large amount of strong external Brønsted acid still exists in ZSM-11(TB,HN). So it can be concluded as follows: The removal of the Al species of ZSM-11 by acid treatment also leads to the decrease in the external Brønsted acid amount, the decreased external Brønsted acid is mainly weak acid without catalytic activity, and the strong external Brønsted acid still exists. The removal of these weak external Brønsted acid sites increases the relative amount of the strong external Brønsted acid, resulting in the increased TeMB selectivity. 3 Conclusions In summary, we prepared a tandem catalyst composed of ZnZrO solid solution and modified ZSM-11 zeolite. The catalyst shows good catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation to aromatics and TeMB. After the modification of ZSM-11, the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products increases from 92 % to 96 %, and the selectivity of the single aromatic product TeMB in aromatics increases from 68 % to 83 % when the conversion of CO2 is about 9 %. We found that modification with organic base TBAOH is more favorable for the removal of Si species of ZSM-11 and more conducive to the creation of uniform mesopores compared to that with TPAOH, thus increasing the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB, the selectivity of aromatics increases from 76 % to 81 % and the selectivity of TeMB increases from 79 % to 81 %. In addition, the secondary acid treatment mainly removes the EFAl species produced by the alkali treatment, which significantly increases the relative amount of the strong Brønsted acid with catalytic activity, thus facilitating further increase in the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB, the selectivities of aromatics and TeMB both increase from 81 % to 83 %.

        "dc:description": "Direct hydrogenation of CO2 into high value−added chemicals and fuels has received great attention in recent years. However, highly selective synthesis of single aromatic product by one−step CO2 hydrogenation is still a big challenge. Herein, we designed a ZnZrO/modified-ZSM-11 tandem catalyst which realized the selectivity of aromatics in liquid products up to 96 % and the selectivity of tetramethylbenzene(TeMB) in aromatics up to 83 % in the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation. We found that the organic base TBAOH is more favorable for the generation of uniform mesopores in ZSM-11 compared to TPAOH, thus increasing the selectivity of aromatics and TeMB. In addition, the secondary acid treatment mainly removes the extra−framework Al(EFAl) species produced by the alkali treatment, which significantly increases the relative amount of the strong Brønsted acid, thus facilitating further increase in the selectivity of aromatics and TeMB.",
