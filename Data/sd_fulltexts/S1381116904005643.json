Fax: +91 40 27160921. The selective synthesis of CH2F2 by the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 is studied over calcined Mg–Al and Mg–Cr hydrotalcites (CMA-HT and CMC-HT) supported Pd catalysts. Their activities are compared with the corresponding oxides, viz., MgO, γ-Al2O3 and Cr2O3 supported Pd catalysts. Pd catalyst on the support from Mg–Al HT precursor is found to be superior and advantageous in terms of higher selectivity towards CH2F2 formation and stability of the catalyst. The catalysts followed the order: Pd/CMA-HT > Pd/MgO > Pd/γ-Al2O3 > Pd/Cr2O3 > Pd/CMC-HT in terms of the selectivity towards CH2F2 formation. Pd/CMC-HT showed deeper hydrogenation activity towards the formation of CH4. Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/MgO showed a higher increase in the acidity of the catalyst after the reaction, which facilitates to maintain the Pd site in electron deficient environment and thereby yielding higher selectivity towards CH2F2. The lack of sufficient acidity on Pd/CMC further explains the poor selectivity to CH2F2 observed over this catalyst. XPS results also confirm the enrichment of surface fluoride over Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/MgO used catalysts. Graphical abstract The selective synthesis of CH2F2 by the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 is studied over calcined Mg-Al and Mg-Cr hydrotalcites (CMA-HT & CMC-HT) supported Pd catalysts and their activities are compared with the corresponding oxides viz., MgO, γ-Al2O3 and Cr2O3 supported Pd catalysts. Pd catalyst on the support from Mg-Al HT precursor is found to be superior and advantageous in terms of higher selectivity towards CH2F2 formation and stability of the catalyst. Enhanced acidity of the used catalyst of Pd/CMA-HT compared to the fresh one manifested the higher selectivity towards CH2F2. The higher stability of Pd/CMA-HT can be attributed to the absence of any change in the surface Pd composition in the XPS analysis and the synergistic interaction of Pd with the support, calcined Mg-Al HT. Keywords Hydrotalcite MgO CMA-HT CMC-HT Hydrodechlorination CCl2F2 CH2F2 1 Introduction Hydrotalcites (HTs) are a well-known class of compounds for their versatility in catalyzing various types of reactions. Hydrotalcites are less extensively studied as supports in catalyzing vapour phase heterogeneous reactions. Recently we found HTs [1,2] as good supports for Pd catalysts in the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 to CH2F2. Coq and coworkers [3] have also shown Pd-hydrotalcite as a good catalyst for this reaction. The ban on CFCs resulted in the need for the eradication of existing feedstocks that are still causing the destruction of ozone layer and also in synthesizing their alternatives. The development of CFC alternatives has been focused on non-chlorinated compounds with similar physical properties that would break down in the lower atmosphere. One such class of alternatives is the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and the simplest method to obtain them is by the selective hydrogenolysis of CFCs on metal surface with selective chlorine removal, which is called the hydrodechlorination. Supported palladium catalysts are well documented in various reports in the selective synthesis of HFCs from CFCs by hydrodechlorination route [4–15]. Most commonly reported supports are γ-Al2O3, activated carbon, AlF3 or fluorinated aluminas. The basic reason behind using oxides or fluorides is explained as to enhance the electron deficiency of Pd through the Lewis acidity of the supports. Coq et al. [5] explained the reason as the easier desorption of the :CF2 species, which is found to be a key intermediate in governing the selectivity of desired product, CH2F2 in the hydrodechlorination of CFC-12 (CCl2F2) from the surface of more electron deficient Pd. However, higher Lewis acidity of AlF3 or Al2O3 type supports can lead to fast deactivation of catalysts and supports of carbon suffer from poor selectivity to desired product with higher dispersion of active component, Pd over it leading to the formation of deeper hydrogenation product, CH4. Also, this support offers poor mechanical strength to the catalyst. Hence, there is a need to look for alternative supports. Basic carriers such as MgO, calcined Mg–Al HT and calcined Mg–Cr HT are found to show stable and higher activity towards the formation of CH2F2 in our earlier studies [15,1,2]. The present work is aimed at the study on the comparison of the hydrodechlorination activity of CCl2F2 over two different Pd supported on calcined HT systems namely Mg–Al and Mg–Cr HTs with their individual oxide supports, viz., MgO, γ-Al2O3 and Cr2O3. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts A Pd loading of 6wt.% was deposited by wet impregnation method over five different supports, γ-Al2O3 (commercial, Harshaw), MgO (prepared by precipitation from Mg(NO3)2 using aqueous NaOH solution), Cr2O3 (from Cr(NO3)3 by precipitating with liquid NH3), mixed oxides of MgO–Al2O3 (CMA-HT) and MgO–Cr2O3 (CMC-HT) obtained from their corresponding hydrotalcite precursors. Earlier studies [2] indicated a Pd loading of 6wt.% to be optimum for obtaining good activity and selectivity in the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 to CH2F2. The Mg–Al and Mg–Cr HTs were prepared by Reichle's method [16] and the details of the preparation were reported elsewhere [1,2]. These hydrotalcites were then decomposed at 450°C for 18h in presence of air in case of Mg–Al HT and in N2 with Mg–Cr HT to yield CMA-HT and CMC-HT supports, respectively. 2.2 Characterization of catalysts All the fresh and used catalysts have been characterized by BET-surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3. BET-surface areas were measured on an all glass high vacuum system by N2 adsorption at 10−6 Torr vacuum at −196°C. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts were recorded on a Siemens X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. TPR profiles of the samples were generated on a home-made on-line reactor system which is connected to a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID). The patterns were taken from ambient temperature to 700°C at a heating ramp of 5°C/min. and kept at the final temperature isothermally for about 30min. The same system was used for the TPD experiments using ammonia as the probe molecule for evaluating the acidities of the catalysts in the temperature range of 100–500°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min. A data station with standard GC software was used to record the TPR and TPD patterns. The details of the TPR and TPD experiments were discussed in our earlier report [15]. The surface analysis of the catalysts by XPS was done on a KRATOS Axis 165 Photoelectron Spectrometer equipped with an Mg Kα source. The binding energy correction was performed by using the C 1s peak at 284.6eV as a reference for all the elements recorded. The relative intensities of the surface composition of different elements were corrected with their corresponding atomic sensitivity factors using the Vision 2 software in Unix system. 2.3 Activity evaluation The hydrogenolysis of CCl2F2 over the five different catalysts in this study was carried out in a fixed bed micro-reactor interfaced to a gas chromatograph equipped with an FID. The product mixture was injected into the GC column (Porapak-Q, 3m long and 1/8″ diameter made of S.S.) through a 6-port sampling valve after it is scrubbed with alkali (KOH solution) to remove the HCl/HF that evolute during the course of the reaction. The products were also analyzed and confirmed by GC–MS analysis. The earlier studies [2] showed the reaction temperature of 250°C, a gas-hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 4000h−1 and a molar ratio of H2/CCl2F2 of 8 as optimum reaction conditions over a 6wt.% Pd supported on CMA-HT catalyst. Thus, the same conditions were chosen for the comparative study in the present work. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 BET-surface areas and acidities Table 1 presents the BET-surface areas and acidities measured from TPD of NH3 of the various fresh and used catalysts studied for the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2. The surface areas of all the catalysts are found to be reduced after the reaction, which may be accounted for the transformation of the oxidic supports to their corresponding oxo/hydroxofluorides or fluorides [6,15]. Such transformation of alumina to its corresponding oxo/hyrdroxofluorides is also reported in the dismutation of CCl2F2 by Venugopal et al. [17] and Kemnitz et al. [18]. The acidities of the catalysts seemed to have enhanced after the reaction again due to the same reason since the contribution of oxo/hydroxo fluorides or fluorides towards the increase in the Lewis acidity due to Mg2+ or Al3+ ions of the catalyst is higher compared to the O2− ions. The increase in the acidity is higher in case of Pd/MgO and Pd/CMA-HT catalysts, which showed higher selectivity towards the formation of CH2F2. Acidity of the support is one of the key factors that governs the selectivity of CH2F2 as shown by Coq et al. [5] in the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 over acidic supports like AlF3 that acidic nature of the support facilitates an easier desorption of the intermediate :CF2 from the electron deficient Pd species. The role of the support is to impart partial positive charge to Pd thus making it electron deficient (Pd δ +). In our earlier report [15], it is shown that increase in the acidity is higher over MgO than on Al2O3 after the reaction corresponding to the transformation of MgO to MgF2 and Al2O3 to AlF1.65(OH)1.35·xH2O and a surface enrichment of fluoride being higher in case of MgO support (as observed from the TPD of NH3 and XPS results). The higher selectivity of CH2F2 over MgO as compared to Al2O3 is attributed to this enhanced acidity. The selectivity towards CH2F2 over Pd/CMA-HT has been explained on similar grounds [2] but the higher selectivity to desired product here may also be due to a synergistic interaction of Pd with the support Mg–Al HT precursor probably to the ordered structure of the support and its precursor. In case of Pd/CMC-HT, there is no change seen in the acidity of the catalyst even after the reaction although the XRD patterns reveal the formation of MgF2 and CrF3·3H2O phases. One reason may be that the support i.e., calcined Mg–Cr HT itself does not seem to have any considerable acidity/basicity [19] to have shown any enhancement in the acidity of this catalyst after the reaction. 3.2 XPS results The XPS results (Table 2 ) clearly show the BEs of Pd 3d5/2 indicative of PdO in the calcined catalysts. Although presence of some metallic Pd species is observed in the XRD patterns, surface analysis by XPS has not revealed any such species. However, the used catalysts have clearly shown the presence of Pd0 species with BEs ∼335eV along with the presence of some Pd peaks at 336–338eV. These values have been ascribed [15] to the transformation of Pd0 to Pd+ or Pd2+ probably due to the presence of surface fluoride species. Shen et al. [20] attributed the shift in the BE of Pd 3d5/2 from 335.1 to 336.2eV in the Pd/MgO catalysts with Pd from PdCl2 precursor to the intimate contact of Pd and Mg that lead to an electron transfer from Pd to Mg as evidenced by the presence of Pd n + ions in reduced catalysts. The BE value of 51.2eV in the Mg 2p spectra of the used catalyst of Pd/CMA-HT indicates the formation of MgF2 from MgO of catalyst with Mg 2p BE of 49.8eV. The BE value of Al 2p in reduced catalyst changed from 73.9 to 74.9eV in used catalyst again indicates a partial transformation of Al2O3 to its oxo/hydroxo fluorides since the BE value of Al is intermittent to that present either in Al2O3 or AlF3 (BE of Al 2p = 76eV) [21]. The BEs of Cr 2p have been found to shift from 576.7eV to 577.6eV denoting the transformation of oxidic chromium to corresponding fluoride, which is also indicated in the XRD patterns of the used Pd/CMC-HT sample. The additional satellite peaks of Cr 2p are also observed in the Pd/CMC-HT samples at 578.6 and 579.5eV in fresh and used catalysts, respectively, which is a characteristic phenomenon of the first row transition metal series. In fact, the transition metal ions have unfilled 3d orbitals [22,23] that show well separated satellite peaks in the core level XP spectra due to electron shake up and the structure of satellite reflects the nature of chemical bonding of the transition metal ions. Kemnitz et al. [24] in their extensive study of XPS on modified chromia catalysts for the chlorine/fluorine exchange reactions of CFCs showed the presence of strong secondary satellite structures on the high binding energy side in the Cr(III) 2p spectra. They reported the binding energy values of Cr 2p3/2 in α-Cr2O3 and CrF3 as 576.1 and 579.58eV. A shift of the Cr 2p3/2 BE from 576.1 to 576.8eV. The shift has been explained by a partial hydrogenation of surface chromium species. In another report Kemnitz et al. [18] have reported for the transformation of chromia to chromium hydroxyl fluoride which could only be seen in the samples containing >80% Cr in the dismutation of CCl2F2 over Cr and Mg containing catalysts. In the present report the shift of BE value of Cr 2p from 576.7 to 577.6eV in Pd/CMC-HT catalyst can be attributed to the partial fluorination of surface chromium atoms. Although no oxo/hydroxo fluoride phases of chromium are found in the XRD analysis. Probably these phases may be present in X-ray amorphous form because of the lower Cr content in the Pd/CMC-HT catalyst. Kemnitz et al. [18] have observed the appearance of chromium hydroxofluoride phase only in the catalyst with >80% Cr content. Similar observations can be made from the XPS spectra of Pd/MgO and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts which are discussed more in detail elsewhere [15]. The F/M (M = Al or Mg or Al + Mg or Cr + Mg) atomic ratios show the enrichment of fluorine on the surface of Pd/MgO and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The Pd/CMA-HT surface also shows the presence of fluorine but the ratio is not that high as in case of the other catalysts mentioned in Table 2. Pd/M (M = Al or Mg or Al + Mg or Cr + Mg) ratios indicate low amounts of Pd on the surface of the catalysts and it is interesting to note that there is not much variation in the surface composition of Pd even after the reaction on Pd/CMA-HT catalyst unlike the other catalysts which showed a considerable loss in the surface Pd content as seen from the Pd/M ratios of their used catalysts. In fact, there is a slight increase in the surface Pd content as observed from the increased Pd/M value in the used catalysts of Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/CMC-HT than in their fresh catalysts. This might be the probable reason for the higher stability of HT-precursor supported Pd catalysts over the other catalysts studied. 3.3 XRD results Figs. 1 and 2 represent the X-ray diffraction patterns of calcined and used supported Pd catalysts, respectively, studied for the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2. All the calcined catalysts showed the presence of very weak d-lines of α-Pd phase at 2θ = 40° for 2.25 x , 2θ = 46.5° for 1.954 and 2θ = 67.9° for 1.383 [ASTM no. 5-681] apart from the characteristic d-lines of their corresponding supports, viz., Cr2O3 [ASTM no. 6-504], γ-Al2O3 [ASTM no. 16-394], MgO [ASTM no. 4-829], poorly crystalline phase of MgO [ASTM no. 4-829] in case of calcined Mg–Al HT and Mg–Cr HT. The catalysts with HT-precursors as supports have shown the presence of HT-phase [ASTM no. 22-700] in case of Pd/CMA-HT and Stichtite phase [ASTM no. 14-330] in the XRD pattern of Pd/CMC-HT calcined catalyst. The presence of PdO phase [ASTM no. 6-515] is also indicated by the peaks with d-values: 2.64 x at 33.9°, 2.674 at 33.5° and 1.673 at 54.9° in the XRD patterns of all the calcined catalysts. The pattern of Cr2O3 supported catalyst showed some unidentified phases of chromium. The partial transformation of MgO to MgF2 with d-values: 3.27 x at 27.2°, 2.23 x at 40.4° and 1.718 at 53.5° [ASTM no. 6-290], α-Pd to PdC x with d-values: 2.303 x at 39.1°, 1.991 at 45.5° and 1.405 at 66.5° and γ-Al2O3 to AlF1.65(OH)1.35·xH2O with d-values: 5.70 x at 15.5°, 2.985 at 29.9° and 1.743 at 52.6° [ASTM no. 18-24] is clearly evidenced in the XRD patterns of used catalysts. The calcined HTs also have transformed to corresponding fluorides or oxo/hydroxo fluorides with MgO–Al2O3 from Mg–Al HT to MgF2 and AlF1.65(OH)1.35·xH2O and MgO–Cr2O3from Mg–Cr HT to MgF2 and CrF3·3H2O with d-values: 4.70 x at 18.9°, 4.106 at 21.6° and 2.588 at 34.7° [ASTM no. 17-316], respectively. The transformation of oxidic supports to corresponding fluorides or oxo/hydroxofluorides is well known [6,15] in the hydrodechlorination of CFCs with the evolution of HCl/HF during the course of the reaction. 3.4 TPR results TPR profiles of the calcined and used supported Pd catalysts are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. Except for Pd/MgO and Pd/CMA-HT, all the other three catalysts have shown the presence of a negative signal at ∼90°C corresponding to the decomposition of β-PdH x that forms at slightly high temperature above ambient with the absorption of hydrogen into the sub-surfaces of metallic Pd [25,26] since, most of the palladium precursors are reported to reduce at ambient temperature itself in hydrogen atmosphere [27]. The appearance of a positive peak ∼160–200°C in all the MgO containing catalysts, viz., Pd/MgO, Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/CMC-HT can be attributed to the delayed reduction of PdO species. Over Pd/MgO, the peak is observed at ∼160°C which has been shifted to higher temperatures of 190 and 200°C in the CMA-HT and CMC-HT supported catalysts, respectively. The absence of β-PdH x decomposition peak over Pd/MgO and Pd/CMA-HT may be attributed to the higher dispersion of Pd over these supports that may be obstructing the absorption of hydrogen into sub-surfaces of Pd and thus the formation of any β-PdH x and/or to the interaction of PdO and MgO delaying the reduction of PdO to form metallic Pd. The reduction peak of PdO in the TPR profiles of these catalysts also supports this assumption. The simultaneous negative and positive peaks at ∼400 and above 500°C in the MgO containing catalysts may be ascribed to the partial desorption of hydrogen that is chemisorbed on both palladium and magnesia [28] and to the possible spill over of the hydrogen activated on metallic Pd to the support [29], respectively. The Pd/Cr2O3 catalyst showed two reduction maxima at 350 and 500°C corresponding to the loss of labile oxygen in two stages associated with Cr2O3 at high temperatures and a T max at ∼650°C which is also observed with Pd/CMC-HT probably to the bulk reduction of Cr2O3 [30]. The TPR patterns of all the used catalysts have shown the presence of β-PdH x decomposition peak, which clearly indicates a transformation or reconstruction of Pd particles taking place during the course of reaction. The presence of β-PdH x is an indication that Pd in the used catalysts is present majorly in metallic form. The other high temperature positive and negative signals at ∼425 and ∼575°C may be attributed to the consumption of hydrogen by carbonaceous species present on the catalyst surface and to the evolution of CH4 (also confirmed by a coupled FID analysis of the outlet stream from TCD) due to the reduction of coke moieties (CH x , x ≥ 2) present on the catalyst surface [1,15]. The presence of surface CH2 species is also reported by Deshmukh and d’Itri [12] in the used Pd/AlF3 catalyst. 3.5 Hydrodechlorination activity The hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 is studied over Pd supported on calcined Mg–Al HT and calcined Mg–Cr HT catalysts and their activities have been compared to the activities of their individual single oxide supported Pd catalysts namely Pd/MgO, Pd/γ-Al2O3 and Pd/Cr2O3. Our earlier studies [1,2] have demonstrated that the supports from the HT-precursors to be highly active for this reaction. The optimized reaction conditions in those studies with a reaction temperature of 250°C, GHSV = 4000h−1 and H2/CCl2F2 molar ratio of 8 are taken as the standard conditions in the present work for screening the catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the time-on-stream activities of the various catalysts studied, which clearly indicates that a steady state is reached in about 4–5h of the reaction. Hence, the activity data at 6h is taken as a steady state activity. An increasing trend in the % conversion of CCl2F2, % selectivity to CH2F2 (correspondingly the % yield of CH2F2) and a decreasing trend in the % selectivity to CH4 are observed in all most all the catalysts except for Mg–Cr HT, which showed an increased selectivity towards CH4 with time. Table 3 depicts the comparative steady state activities of catalysts studied for the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2. The table reveals the advantage of HT-precursor especially Mg–Al HT in the selective synthesis of CH2F2 from CCl2F2 over the other catalysts. The selectivity towards CH2F2 over these catalysts are observed in the order: Pd/CMA-HT > Pd/MgO > Pd/γ-Al2O3 > Pd/Cr2O3 > Pd/CMC-HT. The higher hydrogenolytic activity of Pd/MgO catalyst in complete cleavage of CCl bonds has been ascribed to the strong hydridic character of hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on the electron-rich Pd particles in strong contact with O2− sites of MgO [31,32]. Also, MgO support is reported to adsorb chlorine [33] thus facilitating easier cleavage of CCl bonds. But no chloride compounds of magnesium are detected either from XRD or XPS analyses though Choi et al. [34] reported for the formation of MgCl2·xH2O phase after the reaction in the hydrodechlorination of CCl4. Thus MgO seem to play an important role in removing Cl from the reactant molecule and thus facilitating the easier formation of the desired product. The absence of any magnesium chloride may be that the Cl that is adsorbed by MgO must be scavenging off in the form of HCl during the course of the reaction. The selectivity to CH2F2 is known to be governed mainly by the particle size or dispersion, geometry of the Pd crystallites and the nature of the support i.e., acidity of the support [5]. Juszczyk et al. [11] have shown that bulky Pd particles constitute a more capacious sink for carbon and contain higher proportion of surface plane sites. Further, they suggested carbided Pd surfaces to be the sites of high selectivity towards CH2F2. According to Coq et al. [5], the Lewis acidity of the supports like AlF3 enhances the electron deficiency of Pd facilitating the easier desorption of the surface intermediate :CF2 species, which are responsible for the higher selectivity to CH2F2. They have clearly demonstrated in the mechanism proposed for the hydrodechlorination of CCl2F2 that the desorption of :CF2 intermediate is the rate-governing step. If :CF2 species resides for a longer time on Pd surfaces, defluorination is favored leading to the formation of CH4 in more amounts. Thus, the enhanced acidities of the catalysts (after the reaction) in Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/MgO with the transformation of the oxidic supports (MgO–Al2O3 and MgO) to corresponding fluorides or hydroxofluorides (MgF2, AlF1.65(OH)1.35·xH2O and MgF2) as evidenced clearly from XRD patterns and from the surface analysis by XPS of the catalysts explains the higher selectivity of CH2F2 over these catalysts. And it seems that the lack of sufficient acidity on Pd/CMC-HT is the reason for the higher formation of CH4. As there is no driving force for the easier desorption of :CF2 from Pd species (i.e., the electron deficiency factor of Pd as in Pd/CMA-HT or Pd/MgO), higher selectivity to CH4 over this catalyst is favored. This also indicates the dominative role of the acidity of the catalyst over the other main factor i.e., particle size of Pd. The TPR patterns clearly show the presence of β-PdH x species for which larger Pd particles are required, because formation of β-PdH x is a bulk phenomenon. XRD results also show the presence of larger particles of Pd. Thus larger Pd particles may be one of the reason for getting higher yield of CH2F2. The report by Shen et al. [20] shows the strong ability of chlorine anions to stabilize the bridge structure of Pd (Cl, Cl) Mg2+ and to transfer electrons from Pd to Mg2+ in the catalysts with Cl-containing Pd precursors, which has been evidenced by the presence of Pd n + ions in reduced catalysts. Thus, the BE of Pd 3d5/2 ∼336.2eV in the Pd/MgO and Pd/CMA-HT catalysts may be attributed to the intimate contact of Pd and Mg2+ leading to the electron transfer from Pd to Mg as attributed by Shen et al. [20] from their XPS studies. This can also explain the higher selectivity to CH2F2 formation over these catalysts with electron deficiency generated on Pd by this contact. The activity study over Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/MgO has clearly established the superiority of Pd/CMA-HT in terms of the stability showing a very stable and almost same activity even after 30h time on stream where as Pd/MgO although showed good selectivity to CH2F2, suffered loss in activity after about 15h showing about 35–40% conversion of CCl2F2. However, the selectivity to CH2F2 over Pd/MgO has not varied much even after 15h time on stream. The other catalysts, viz., Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/Cr2O3 also showed loss in activity after 10h itself. The Pd/CMC-HT even though showed stable activity, it is only found to be more selective for CH4 formation than for CH2F2. The Pd/(Al + Mg) surface ratio obtained from XPS analysis showed not much change even after the reaction, which may be taken as one of the reasons for it to show a very stable activity. The higher activity and selectivity of Pd/CMA-HT may be attributed to a synergistic interaction of Pd and the support components in calcined Mg–Al HT. 4 Conclusions 1. The Hydrodechlorination activity performance of the catalysts is found to be in the order: Pd/CMA-HT > Pd/MgO > Pd/Al2O3 > Pd/Cr2O3 > Pd/CMC-HT. 2. β-PdH x decomposition peak is absent in the TPR patterns of Pd/MgO and Pd/CMA-HT fresh catalysts corresponding to delay in PdO reduction (shifting of T max towards the high temperature) due to higher dispersion or the interaction between PdO and MgO. Presence of PdO is observed in the XRD patterns of these catalysts. 3. Transformation of oxidic supports into fluorides/hydroxofluorides as evidenced from both the XPS and XRD analysis and also the enhanced acidities observed by TPD of NH3 of used catalysts compared to fresh catalysts; manifested the higher selectivities towards CH2F2 over Pd/CMA-HT and on Pd/MgO compared to other catalyst systems. 4. Pd/CMC-HT showed a deeper hydrogenation activity towards the formation of CH4, which is presumably due to the poor acidity of the catalyst compared to other systems. 5. The higher stability of Pd/CMA-HT can be observed from the absence of any change in the surface Pd composition in the XPS analysis and the synergistic interaction of Pd with the support, calcined Mg–Al HT.

Pd/CMC-HT showed deeper hydrogenation activity towards the formation of CH4. Pd/CMA-HT and Pd/MgO showed a higher increase in the acidity of the catalyst after the reaction, which facilitates to maintain the Pd site in electron deficient environment and thereby yielding higher selectivity towards CH2F2. The lack of sufficient acidity on Pd/CMC further explains the poor selectivity to CH2F2 observed over this catalyst.
