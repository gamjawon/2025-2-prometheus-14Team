ABSTRACT Metal single-atom/atomic cluster catalysts (SA/AC) have emerged as effective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their high metal atom utilization and controllable metal coordination environments. However, the designing and tuning of the local electronic environments of SA/AC ensembles remain a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a single-atom-modified atomic cluster copper catalyst (Cu SA/ACs) for CO2RR. The SA/AC-induced modulation of the local electronic structure enhances CO2 adsorption on the atomic cluster; additionally, the atomic cluster provides abundant active hydrogen for CO2 protonation by mediating hydrolysis dissociation on the SAs. Consequently, compared to copper single-atom catalysts (Cu SACs), the Cu SA/ACs exhibit significantly improved activity, the current is 3.6 times that of Cu SACs, and the Faradaic efficiency of CO rose from 27.15% to 98.94%. The Cu SA/ACs catalyst can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO in flow-cell configuration, and the CO selectivity is 93.06% at a current density of 600 mA cm–2. The maximum energy efficiency of the cathode is 61.9%, which is superior to that of most CO2-to-CO catalysts. This work provides a new perspective for developing efficient SA/AC catalysts. Graphical Abstract The synergistic effect of single atom and atomic cluster promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the hydrolysis process on single atom provides abundant proton source for CO2RR on atomic cluster. Keywords CO2 reduction reaction Active site synergism Single atom Atomic cluster Electrocatalysis 1 Introduction The continuing decline in the cost of upgrading to renewable electricity and the development of electrocatalytic technology are prompting our society to rethink how and where we produce fuels and chemicals [1,2]. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into high-value-added products represents a transformative technology that can diminish greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the consequences of catastrophic climate change [3–5]. Among the diverse products of CO2 reduction, CO holds paramount significance, as it serves not only as a vital raw material for the water-gas shift reaction, but also has direct utility in the synthesis of methanol, syngas, and other chemical products through the Fischer-Tropsch process [6,7]. Nevertheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO presents pressing challenges in terms of overall efficiency. Hence, exploring efficient, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts is imperative for the industrial advancement of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The reported single-atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) catalysts for the CO2RR have shown tremendous potential due to their high atomic efficiency and unique electronic structure [8–19]. Nevertheless, the efficiency of SA or AC catalysts is insufficient in numerous scenarios, particularly the facilitation of multi-step, multi-electron reactions [20–25]. Integrating SAs and ACs into a unified system can generate exceptionally gratifying catalytic performance. For instance, the synergistic interaction between Ni SAs and PtZn ACs selectively facilitates the reduction of CO2 to CO. The adsorption and conversion energies of the *COOH intermediate are markedly optimized, leading to heightened Faradaic efficiency and selectivity [26]. In another scenario, oxygen-coordinated Fe SAs effectively modulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs, which are the 2e− ORR active sites, resulting in optimal binding strength of the intermediate *OOH for high-efficiency H2O2 production [27]. In these studies, the metal ACs furnish active sites that incorporate neighboring metal atoms while preserving them as discrete entities [28]. The potential synergistic interactions between the AC metal atoms and SAs give rise to distinct electronic and geometric attributes. This unique mechanism engenders diverse adsorption behaviors at distinct sites, facilitating the modulation of intermediate configurations and augmenting performance. Thus, the design and construction of SA/AC ensembles and the elucidation of their potential catalytic mechanisms are of paramount significance. This work presents a high-temperature pyrolysis strategy to prepare a single-atom-modified atomic cluster copper catalyst on a nitrogen-doped carbon support. The SA/AC-induced modulation of the local electronic structure enhances CO2 adsorption on the atomic cluster; additionally, the atomic cluster provides abundant active hydrogen for CO2 protonation by mediating hydrolysis dissociation on the single atoms. The partial current density of CO for Cu SA/ACs is 3.6 times higher than the Cu SACs, and the Faradaic efficiency increased from 24.15% to 99.7%. In a flow cell, when the current density reached 600 mA cm–2, the CO selectivity exceeded 93%, surpassing the majority of similar copper-based catalysts. The cathode energy efficiency reached a maximum of 61.9%. Furthermore, in-situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations further demonstrated the feasibility of regulating the CO2 reaction pathway in the SA/AC catalytic system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials Urea (General-Reagent, 99%), D-(+)-Glucose (General-Reagent, 99%), sodium citrate (Aldrich, 99%), copper chloride dihydrate (General-Reagent, 99%), Nafion (Macklin, 5 wt% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water, contains 45% water), ethanol (≥ 99.7%, General-Reagent), potassium bicarbonate (Aladdin, > 98%), sulfuric acid (Macklin, 99.99%), potassium hydroxide (Macklin, 99.99%), hydrofluoric acid (Aladdin, > 98%), ammonium fluoride (Macklin, 99.99%), deuterium oxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% atom% D, contains 0.05 wt% TMSP), DI water (18.25 MΩ cm) were used in this study. 2.2 Preparation of catalysts C3N4 was synthesized by annealing in air. Specifically, 30 g of urea was heated to 550 °C at 5 °C min–1, held at that temperature for 4 h, and then allowed to cool naturally to room temperature to obtain a pale-yellow powder. 1 g of as-prepared C3N4 and 0.9 g of d-glucose monohydrate were mixed by grinding for 30 min. In an Ar atmosphere, the mixed powder was heated at 1000 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min–1 in a tube furnace, and then allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The resulting powder was added to 20 mL of 0.5 mol L–1 H2SO4 solution and stirred overnight in an oil bath at 80 °C, followed by washing and centrifugal drying to obtain the powder, nitrogen-doped carbon (NC). 5.3 mg of copper chloride dihydrate and 11.2 mg of citric acid were dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 10 minutes to obtain a clear green solution. Then, 100 mg of the prepared NC was added to the above Cu2+/ethanol solution, sonicated for 1 h to ensure thorough mixing, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The powder was heated to 300 °C in a tube furnace filled with argon gas at a rate of 5 °C min–1, held at that temperature for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting powder was added to 20 mL of 0.5 mol L–1 H2SO4 solution and stirred overnight in an oil bath at 80 °C, followed by washing and centrifugal drying to obtain the final catalyst powder of Cu SA/ACs. 2.3 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D2 PHASER diffractometer with a Cu K α source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, with the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was performed using a FEI Tecnai G300 scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100, while high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired with a JEM-ARM300F. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization was performed using a ThermoFisher Themis Z microscope with two aberration correctors at 300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field STEM with spherical aberration correction (HAADF-STEM) images were recorded using a convergence semi-angle of 11 mrad and inner and outer collection angles of 59 and 200 mrad, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out using four in-column Super-X detectors. The Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) experiment was acquired using soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the U19 beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory of China. The Cu contents of the samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Agilent 5110). Raman spectra were carried out using a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical measurements were performed in a customized gas-tight H-glass cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. A DH7002 electrochemical workstation was used to record the electrochemical responses. An Ag/AgCl electrode (0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3) and a platinum mesh were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials in the study were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation: E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.197. The potentials and voltages in this study were not iR-calibrated. In the H-cell tests, the electrolyte was 0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3 (40 mL per compartment). The electrolyte was not saturated with CO2 in advance of the test; the gas flow rate of high-purity CO2 (99.9999%) during the test was 10 sccm, and was calibrated using a mass flow controller. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using an AC voltage with an amplitude of 5 mV applied over the frequency range of 105 to 0.001 Hz at a certain overpotential. For the flow cell test, Cu SA/ACs were air-brushed onto 29BC GDL for use as the CO2RR cathode (1 × 1 cm2). A platinum mesh (1 × 1 cm2) and a Hg/HgO electrode (1 mol L–1 KOH) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The reference electrode chamber and the anode chamber were separated by a Fumasep FAB-PK-130 membrane. The flow rate of carbon dioxide gas on the cathode side was 20 sccm, while 1.0 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte was circulated at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1 on the anode side. 2.5 CO2RR product analysis The gas phase products after bulk electrolysis were quantified using an online gas chromatograph (FuLi, GC7970) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID for CO and hydrocarbons) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD for H2). The liquid products were quantified using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Varian 700 MHz spectrometer (16.4 T)). For gaseous products, the Faradaic efficiency (FEgas) was calculated as follows: (1) FE gas = q g q t o t × 100 % = v × V × N × F 60 × 24000 × j × 100 % where v is the CO2 flow rate, V is the measured product concentration in the GC sample loop, N is was the number of electrons transferred to form a molecule of CO or H2 (N = 2 in this case), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol–1), and j is the total current. The TOF for CO was calculated as follows: (2) TOF ( h - 1 ) = j CO / NF m cat × w / M Cu × 3600 jco: partial current (A) for the product CO; N: number of electrons transferred for product formation, which is 2 for CO; F: 96485 C mol−1; m cat: catalyst mass in the electrode, g; w: Cu loading in the catalyst; M Cu: atomic mass of Cu, 63.546 g mol−1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization The Cu SA/ACs catalyst was synthesized through the complexation of citric acid with copper chloride, utilizing nitrogen-doped carbon as the supporting material, followed by high-temperature annealing in an Ar atmosphere (Fig. 1(a) ) [15,29]. Cu SAC catalysts without AC were also prepared by omitting citric acid during the synthesis. The precise loading ratio was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the values are detailed in Table S1. The crystal structures of the samples were investigated using XRD (Fig. S1). The XRD patterns revealed that the primary peaks of all three samples aligned with those of the (002) plane of carbon, and no distinct metal diffraction peaks were observed, excluding the existence of metallic species in the Cu SA/ACs and Cu SACs. The morphology and elemental distribution of the synthesized catalysts are shown in Figs. 1(b)–(g) and Figs. S2–S4. The scanning electron microscopy images (Fig. 1(b)) show that the carrier exhibits a morphology of layered carbon with a wrinkled and folded structure. HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1(c)) revealed high-density clusters of bright spots and numerous isolated bright spots on the carrier, corresponding to Cu ACs and SAs. Additionally, samples without added citric acid exhibited only Cu SACs, affirming that the introduction of citric acid facilitates the formation of the ACs (Fig. S5). Statistical analysis revealed that 84.7% of the clusters were smaller than 0.3 nm, indicating that SA and AC were the primary types of clusters present (Fig. S6). EDS confirmed the uniform distribution of Cu on the support. 3.2 Identification of the structure of Cu SA/ACs The electronic structure and coordination environment of the Cu SA/ACs were scrutinized via XANES and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses (Figs. 1(h), 1(i) and Figs. S7–S10). As depicted in Fig. 1(h), the pre-edge absorption peak of the Cu SA/ACs lay between those of Cu2O and CuO, signifying that the oxidation state of Cu in the Cu SA/ACs ranged between +1 and +2 [30]. The Cu 2p spectrum of the Cu SA/ACs revealed that the binding energy of the Cu 2p 2/3 peak (932.9 eV) surpassed that of Cu0 (932.6 eV) and Cu+ (932.7 eV), implying that the average oxidation state of Cu in the Cu SA/ACs exceeded +1, in agreement with the findings in the XANES spectra (Fig. S11). Additionally, the N 1s spectrum of the Cu SA/ACs verified the existence of Cu–N bonds, affirming the presence of nitrogen-anchored Cu atoms (Fig. S12). To further examine the details of the Cu–N coordination structure, we analyzed the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum. The Cu SA/ACs exhibited a peak at approximately 1.5 Å, which originated from the first layer of Cu–N coordination (Fig. 1(i)). Additionally, a low-intensity Cu–Cu coordination peak at approximately 2.5 Å was observed, confirming the presence of AC in the Cu SA/ACs. The fitting results indicated coordination numbers (CN) of 3.08 and 1 for N and Cu, respectively, and a coordination number of 1.5 for Cu–Cu (Table S2). Based on the experimental R-space data and fitted Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra, a local structure of CuN3/Cu3 was proposed. In the wavelet-transformed EXAFS spectra of the Cu SA/ACs (Fig. 1(j) and Fig. S13), two intensity maxima were discerned at ~6.2 and ~8.2 Å–1, corresponding to Cu–N and Cu–Cu bonds, respectively. These findings clarified the coexistence of SA and AC in the Cu SA/ACs. 3.3 Electrocatalytic performance in the reduction of CO2 To assess the influence of the introduction of ACs on the electrochemical performance of the Cu SA/ACs, CO2 reduction performance evaluations of all samples were carried out using an H-type cell in CO2-saturated 0.5 mol L–1 KHCO3 electrolyte. Furthermore, we conducted performance assessments at high current densities using a flow cell in 1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte. Throughout the testing process, the current density of the reduction product and the Faradaic efficiency served as the performance evaluation metrics. In previous reports in the literature, CO was not considered a target product for Cu SACs or Cu clusters. Due to the moderate adsorption strength of *CO intermediates, over-hydrogenation products such as CH4, CH3OH, or C2+ are more likely to form at these catalytic sites. LSV results showed a significant increase in the current density when CO2 was introduced compared to the results under an Ar atmosphere (Fig. 2(a) ). Subsequently, the LSV curves of all samples were compared. The current density of the Cu SA/ACs was significantly higher than that of the other samples, demonstrating that the introduction of the atomic clusters enhanced the CO2RR activity of the Cu SA/ACs (Fig. S14). Furthermore, the Cu SA/ACs achieved an almost 200 mV decrease in the potential needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2 compared to other samples, demonstrating their optimal catalytic activity. The selectivity toward the CO2RR was also explored. We tested all samples at potentials ranging from –0.3 to –0.7 V (Figs. 2(b), 2(c) and Fig. S15) and determined the corresponding Faradaic efficiency values. In aqueous electrolytes, CO2RR is often influenced by the competitive HER, especially when using copper-based catalysts [31,32]. Only gaseous products, including CO, CH4, C2H4, and H2, were observed throughout the testing process (Figs. S16 and S17). As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the Cu SA/ACs maintained FECO values above 95% across a wide potential range from –0.3 to –0.7 V, indicating the outstanding CO2RR selectivity of the Cu SA/ACs. The CO2RR performance of the NC substrate was assessed to evaluate its influence on the performance. The results suggest that the NC exhibits poor performance in the CO2RR. The performances of the Cu SACs and Cu NPs were far inferior to that of the Cu SA/ACs, implying that the catalytic activity enhancement can be attributed to the Cu atomic clusters (Fig. 2(c)). Combining the LSV tests with the FECO results, we determined the CO current density at various potentials. As depicted in Fig. 2(d), the partial current density of CO for the Cu SA/ACs markedly exceeds that of the other samples at the tested potentials. At −0.7 V, the CO current density is 65.3 mA cm−2, which is 3.6 times that of the copper SAC (17.95 mA cm−2), demonstrationg the excellent selectivity of the Cu SA/ACs. Additionally, the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated for different samples at the tested potentials, and the Cu SA/ACs achieved a maximum TOF of 28402.95 h–1, significantly surpassing the record values for copper-based catalysts. Furthermore, compared to recently reported copper-based SA/AC catalysts, the Cu SA/ACs exhibited outstanding CO2RR performance (Fig. 2(f) and Table S3). To evaluate their stability, we conducted a 60-hour test of the samples at –0.4 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2(g)). The FECO consistently remained above 95%, and the current density was almost unchanged. Post-testing HAADF-STEM and XRD analyses revealed the absence of aggregated Cu NPs in the Cu SA/ACs, indicating their excellent long-term durability (Figs. S18 and S19). Subsequently, we assessed the viability of the Cu SA/ACs at industrial current densities in a three-electrode flow cell system. We measured the CO2RR performance at densities from 100 to 800 mA cm–2. The results, which are depicted in Fig. 3(a) , illustrate the exceptional CO selectivity of Cu SA/ACs in the current range of 100–600 mA cm–2. At a higher current density (800 mA cm–2), the CO selectivity decreases to 74.6%, but the voltage at this juncture is only 2.32 V vs. RHE. The stability of the material at industrial current densities was then tested (Fig. 3(b)). The tests revealed that the Cu SA/ACs exhibited stability of over 90% over nearly 5 h of testing, with the voltage drop remaining within an acceptable range. Subsequent salt deposition and water flooding hindered contact between the active sites and CO2, leading to decreased performance. We subsequently computed the cathodic energy efficiency (CEE) of the Cu SA/ACs at industrial current densities (Fig. 3(c)). At a current density of 100 mA cm–2, its cathodic energy efficiency reached 61.9%. This result demonstrates that the Cu SA/ACs exhibit outstanding catalytic performance and meet the requirements for high current density for potential industrial applications. A comprehensive comparison among the samples was conducted to unveil the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the SA/AC catalyst, considering the parameters of Tafel slope, electrochemical active surface area, and charge transfer resistance. Compared to other samples such as the Cu SACs, the Cu SA/ACs exhibited a lower Tafel slope, indicating faster reaction kinetics (Fig. S20). Furthermore, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance of the Cu SA/ACs (3.25 mF cm–2) was significantly higher than that of the other samples (Figs. S21–S23), indicating the exposure of more active sites. In the EIS analysis, the Cu SA/ACs exhibited lower charge transfer resistance during the CO2RR process than the Cu SACs and NCs, as shown in Fig. S24. This demonstrated a significant enhancement in the performance of the Cu SACs due to the introduction of the ACs. 3.4 Study of the adsorption behavior of intermediates involving atomic clusters In-situ attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the changes in the surface-adsorbed species during the CO2RR process. Figs. 3(d) and 3(e) present the characteristic surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (SEIRAS) bands in the spectra of the Cu SA/ACs. The spectra revealed applied-potential-dependent behavior. Under an applied potential, bands at ~1380, ~1630, and ~1920 cm–1 dominated the spectrum; these bands corresponded to the vibration of the surface C=O double bond (*COOH), the vibration of water (v-HOH), and the vibration of bridge-adsorbed CO (COB), respectively [33,34]. We analyzed the changes in the behavior of the *COOH intermediates on two samples under an applied potential. On the Cu SACs, weak *COOH vibrational peaks were observed, implying that CO2 adsorption and conversion do not readily occur on the SAs. Conversely, a strong vibration peak of water was observed at 1630 cm–1, which is directly correlated with the dissociation rate of interfacial water molecules. Excessive activity of interfacial water molecules leads to coupling of the dissociated active hydrogen species instead of their migration to participate in the proton-electron coupled transfer (PCET) process of the CO2RR near CO2. As observed in the experiment, significant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was observed on the Cu SACs. Notably, with the introduction of the ACs, the intensity of the *COOH vibration increased significantly, indicating simultaneous promotion of CO2 adsorption and conversion. This suggests that introducing the ACs provides more active sites for CO2 adsorption and considerably accelerates the PCET process from CO2 to COOH. This process requires a large amount of active hydrogen, which can be supplied by the dissociation of water on the Cu SAs. This also explains the observation of the active vibration peak of water on the Cu SA/ACs. Typically, these protons are thought to be provided by the decomposition of water, and SAs are considered to be the main water decomposition sites in the tether. We used transition state calculations to reveal the activation energies for water dissociation at different sites. The calculations show that the transition state for water dissociation on SA has an energy barrier of only 1.22 eV. It is noteworthy that the atomic clusters are involved in the bond-breaking process for H2O molecules adsorbed on the SA sites. The ACs accelerate the breakage of hydroxide bonds on the SA sites by capturing hydrogen atoms from the water molecules; after these protons are obtained, they rapidly couple with adsorbed *CO2 to form *COOH, which then releases the active site, and when water is again decomposed by SA capture, the *COOH is rapidly converted to *CO. (Fig. S25) At the same time, we observed the vibrational peak of bridge-adsorbed CO on the Cu SA/ACs at high potentials, typically requiring more than two adsorption sites for bridge adsorption [35]. Thus, this vibrational peak can be attributed to the adsorption of CO by AC. It is worth noting that the desorption of COB typically requires overcoming higher energy barriers [36], potentially leading to the passivation of some adsorption sites. Fortunately, only extremely weak peaks were observed. With further increase in the applied potential, this vibrational peak maintained constant intensity, indicating that only a few sites were affected. Throughout the entire testing process, no clear vibrational peak corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO was observed in the infrared spectrum; only weak characteristic bands were seen. This was attributed to the rapid reaction kinetics causing the swift desorption of top-adsorbed CO, resulting in the detection of faint peaks. This is in good agreement with the SEIRAS results of Amirbeigiarab and colleagues [14]. Therefore, we can decouple the infrared spectrum of the Cu SA/ACs into the H2O dissociation process mediated by Cu SA and the CO2 adsorption and conversion process mediated by Cu AC. Through the synergistic action of the two sites, efficient CO2 electrolysis can be achieved in the SA/AC ensemble. To summarize, we have presented a brief overview of this potential process in Fig. 3(f). The dissociation of water on the SA sites provides a substantial amount of reactive hydrogen species; this process occurs on both the Cu SA/ACs and Cu SACs. Due to the lack of a proton acceptor, proton coupling on the Cu SACs leads to the formation of hydrogen gas. On the Cu SA/ACs, the abundant *CO2 intermediates consume the majority of the reactive hydrogen, accelerating the conversion to *COOH and further hydrogenation to form *CO, which desorbs to generate CO. 3.5 Mechanistic study of the enhancement in the CO2RR performance due to the atomic clusters The results of in-situ infrared spectroscopy tests demonstrated that adding atomic clusters enhanced the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Cu SACs. Bader charge analysis and density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism of the enhancement induced by the ACs in the Cu SA/ACs. The Bader charge density distributions in Figs. 4(a)–(c) reveal that electrons are transferred from the ACs to nearby N atoms when the system contains only the ACs. Due to high symmetry, the Cu atoms in the ACs exhibited similar decreases in electron density. However, in the system containing both SAs and ACs, significant electron transfer occurred between the ACs, SAs, and carriers. The Cu SAs on the Cu SA/ACs reduce the electron transfer to the surrounding N atoms, and some electrons are transferred to the AC, leading to an increase in the charge density of the two copper atoms on the AC. This results in these two copper atoms exhibiting weak negative electronegativity. The adsorption capacity for CO is closely related to the electronegativity of the species; the greater the positive charge of the catalyst, the weaker the adsorption capacity for CO. Conversely, when the catalyst surface exhibits weak negative electronegativity, the adsorption capacity of CO improves, because the feedback π-bonding of metal atoms is predominant at this point [36]. Therefore, ACs near SAs exhibit a stronger affinity for CO2. Compared to the Cu SACs and Cu ACs, this unique modulation of the local electronic structure endows the ACs with outstanding catalytic activity [38]. Electronic density of states calculations were performed to further elucidate the influence of the ACs on the electronic structure of the Cu SA/ACs. Fig. 4(e) displays the calculated projected density of states (PDOS) for the d-orbitals and d-band center (εd) of the Cu atoms on the Cu SA/ACs. The results show that, compared to those of the Cu SACs and Cu ACs, the PDOS bandwidth of the d-orbitals of the Cu atoms on the Cu SA/ACs is widened. This favors the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface. Additionally, the d-band center of the copper atoms is closer to the Fermi level, resulting in significantly improved binding with *CO, thereby enhancing the CO2RR activity of the Cu SA/ACs [39,40]. Additionally, we calculated and analyzed the free energy of the CO2RR on the Cu SA/ACs. As shown in Figs. S4(c) and S4(d), compared to the Cu SACs and Cu ACs, the Cu SA/ACs exhibited a lower energy barrier (0.403 eV) for the *CO2 protonation process. We also calculated the free energies of other potential side reactions on the Cu SA/ACs. The higher energy barrier for the C–C coupling reaction indicated that its occurrence was unfavorable. The above results suggest that the reduction of CO2 to CO was the most favorable reaction pathway [41–43]. 4 Conclusions This work demonstrated a strategy for loading Cu SA/ACs on nitrogen-doped carbon carriers. The study reveals that the intrinsic electron transfer process of the SA/ACs improves the local electronic structure of the ACs, significantly optimizing the adsorption energy of CO2 and thereby promoting the activation of CO2 on the ACs. Simultaneously, the ACs mediate the dissociation of water on the Cu SA sites; as a result, the active hydrogen remains on the AC sites to participate in the proton-coupled electron transfer process of the CO2RR. This process significantly accelerates the conversion of *CO2 to *COOH and results in an increase in FECO from 24.15% on the Cu SAs to 99.7% on the Cu SA/ACs, while the current on Cu SA/ACs is 3.6 times that of Cu SACs, and the competitive HER was almost completely suppressed. The Faraday efficiency of CO is 93.06% at an industrial current density of 600 mA cm–2. At a current density of 100 mA cm–2, the cathode energy efficiency is 61.9%. Experimental results and DFT calculations confirmed that the enhanced local electric field caused by the ACs can improve the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of CO2 protonation, thus promoting CO2 conversion. Importantly, this work elucidates the mechanism of action for the synergistic interaction of AC and SA sites, which will contribute to the highly selective production of multi-carbon products by designing multi-site approaches to synergistically modulate copper-based catalysts.

        "dc:description": "ABSTRACT Metal single-atom/atomic cluster catalysts (SA/AC) have emerged as effective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their high metal atom utilization and controllable metal coordination environments. However, the designing and tuning of the local electronic environments of SA/AC ensembles remain a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a single-atom-modified atomic cluster copper catalyst (Cu SA/ACs) for CO2RR. The SA/AC-induced modulation of the local electronic structure enhances CO2 adsorption on the atomic cluster; additionally, the atomic cluster provides abundant active hydrogen for CO2 protonation by mediating hydrolysis dissociation on the SAs. Consequently, compared to copper single-atom catalysts (Cu SACs), the Cu SA/ACs exhibit significantly improved activity, the current is 3.6 times that of Cu SACs, and the Faradaic efficiency of CO rose from 27.15% to 98.94%. The Cu SA/ACs catalyst can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO in flow-cell configuration, and the CO selectivity is 93.06% at a current density of 600 mA cm–2. The maximum energy efficiency of the cathode is 61.9%, which is superior to that of most CO2-to-CO catalysts. This work provides a new perspective for developing efficient SA/AC catalysts.",
