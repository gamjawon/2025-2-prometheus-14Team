Mass-spectrometric analysis of the iso-butane product shows that extensive intermolecular scrambling occurs in the conversion from n- to iso-butane. Apparently, the reaction mechanism over these catalysts involves a bimolecular reaction, leading to an adsorbed C~ intermediate. At low conversion, the fragmentation pattern of n-butane reveals an intramolecular rearrangement of carbon atoms, i.e. place exchange of C atoms in methyl and methylene groups. Both phenomena had been observed previously for sulfated zirconia (SZ) catalysts; however, for the present catalysts the distribution of the five isotopic iso-butane molecules does not obey the binomial law. The results suggest that isomerization of the C8 intermediate is less extensive than over sulfated zirconia; /3-fission of the 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl ion leads to two fragments with iso-butyl structure with (2+n) and (2-n) 13C atoms, respectively.

Introduction The isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane is a large scale industrial process. Iso-butane is utilized in butene alkylation to iso-octane and the production of MTBE; both products are well known octane boosters of gasoline. In industry, chlorinated alumina, often doped with platinum, is widely used for the isomer- ization of butane and higher alkanes. The manufacture *Corresponding author.

PI1 S0926-860X(97)00 1 49-X of such catalysts requires specialized expertise of proprietary nature. Little is known in the open litera- ture about the detailed mechanism of butane isomer- ization over such catalysts. Recently, butane isomerization over sulfated zirco- nia (SZ), a non-halide alternative for chlorinated alumina, has attracted considerable attention [1-5]. Initially, the unusually high activity of SZ for butane isomerization at low temperatures was attributed to a presumed extraordinary strength of the sites [6], but subsequent research revealed that the prevailing Lewis and Br0nsted acid sites on such catalysts are not 238 V Adeeva. W.M.H. Sachtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 23~243 stronger acids than the corresponding sites in zeolites [7-9]. It appeared instead that the SZ catalysts cir- cumvent the energetically unfavorable monomolecu- lar reaction path via primary carbenium ions; instead they facilitate a bimolecular mechanism [10,11]. Results obtained with isotopically double-labeled butane, 13CH3-12CHz-12CH2-13CH3, suggest that a C8 intermediate is formed which isomerizes and forms iso-C4 fragments via /3-fission. This conclusion was confirmed by kinetic analysis and identification of the C3+C5 co-product [12,13]. Since SZ catalysts and chlorinated alumina catalyze the same reaction in a similar temperature range, the question arises whether or not a similar reaction mechanism is operating over both chlorinated alumina and SZ. As the laboratory hardware which was used by our group for testing SZ catalysts with double labeled 1,4-13C-butane is still in place, we approached three industrial producers of chlorinated alumina catalysts and requested permission to subject samples of their catalysts to the same test. They kindly provided us with samples; the present paper describes mechanistic studies of these catalysts using 1,4-13C-butane. A comparison with our previous studies with SZ is also included. For proprietary reasons, neither chemical analysis nor physical characterization has been carried out of the alumina-based samples. for 6 h, followed by cooling to 274~'C during 3 h and holding at 274 for an additional 5 h. After that procedure the He flow rate was lowered to 20 ml/ min and the gas was passed for 1 h through a cold finger containing CC14 at room temperature. After this treatment the reactor was cooled in flowing He and sealed. The catalysts which were assumed or known to contain a noble metal were reduced, prior to the isomerization test, in a flow of H2 (30 ml/min, UHP grade Madison) by slowly heating to 150 for 2 h and holding at this temperature for an additional 5 h. For the isomerization test 5 g of catalyst was used in all cases. Reaction studies with double labeled butane were carried out in the recirculation system described pre- viously [10,11]. The pre-treated catalysts were evac- uated and heated to the specified reaction temperature. A mixture of 9 ton\" 1,4-~3C-butane (Isotech, Inc.) and 40 torr H2 (UHR Matheson) was introduced into the circulation loop. After a specified time the content of the recirculation system was condensed and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, using the G1800A GCD system (Hewlett-Packard). 3. Results 2. Experimental Four samples were tested; they will be referred to as A, B, C and D. One sample was provided by UOP (Des Plaines, IL, USA); the manufacturer calls it UOP I-8. One sample was obtained from Cytec Industries (Stamford, CT, USA), the manufacturer calls it SN- 7676 and informed us that the gray colored pre- reduced extrudate contains 0.35 wt% Pt and 5.52 wt% C1; the surface area was 163 m2/g. Two samples were obtained from Engelhard (Edison, NJ, USA), the manufacturer informed us that both samples have a surface area of roughly 300 m2/g. One of these samples contained 0.34 wt% Pt, the other was called 'AlzO3-base'. To chlorinate those samples of which no chlorine content was provided by the manufacturer, the sam- ples were dried in He (50 ml/min, UHP Linde) by heating slowly for 3 h up to 316, holding at 316 Reaction conditions, conversions and selectivities are summarized in Table 1. After identical pre-treat- ment the samples displayed a wide range of activities. Therefore, the temperature and the reaction times were adapted to accumulate sufficient iso-butane for chemical and mass spectrometric analysis within roughly the same reaction time. For the most active catalyst, 15 min at 75 sufficed to obtain 25% con- version; 60 min at 265 were needed to convert 10% Table 1 Conversions and selectivities in butane isomerization over industrial catalysts Catalyst T UC) Time Conv.

Conversely, samples A and B, which require very different temperatures to achieve comparable conversion, have similar isomerization selectivities >86%. The least active sample, D, with the highest temperature requirement has an isomer- ization selectivity of only 58%. All four samples produce more propane than pentane, suggesting that C5 and part of the C3 are co-products stemming from a common Cs intermediate, additional propane being formed by true cracking or hydrogenolysis of C4. The catalytic signature of sample B is reminiscent of SZ, which we had tested previously in the same reactor. Table 2 summarizes the results of isotopic distribu- tion analysis over the four catalysts. The numbers were obtained using a computer program, which takes into account fragmentation and corrections for natural abundance; it enabled us to deconvolute the five isotopic iso-butane molecules from the total mass spectra obtained by GC-MS. In all cases iso-butane molecules containing four, three, two, one and zero ~3C atoms were detected. This result is qualitatively similar to that reported previously for SZ catalyst and shows unambiguously that the isomerization is not a purely intra-molecular rearrangement of the four carbon atoms, but that significant inter-molecular scrambling takes place. There are, however, some significant differences between SZ and chlorinated aluminas. Unlike the product obtained over SZ, the reaction product over the alumina-based catalysts displays an isotopic dis- tribution which does not follow the binomial law with coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1, for the C4 molecules with zero, one, two, three and four ~3C atoms, respectively. Still, the distribution shows a very important element of regularity: The concentration of molecules contain- ing three 13C atoms is equal, within experimental error, to that of molecules with one ~3C atom. This equality applies to all catalysts studied here. A simple rationalization for this finding is to assume a C8 intermediate with four lZC and four 13C atoms, which decomposes into two iso-C4 fragments. A similar equality seems to apply for molecules, containing four and zero 13C atoms, respectively. In this case the experimental error is, however, larger, because the numbers are smaller. At low conversion, the n-butane molecules all contain two ~3C and two 12C atoms, confirming that the isotopic scrambling of the iso-butane molecules is indicative of the mechanism in which iso-butane is formed. There is, however, another type of isomeriza- tion taking place simultaneously. Analysis of the n- butane fraction at low overall conversion to iso-butane shows a significant change in the MS peak ratios for m/z=44 and m/z=45. These peaks are assigned to the propyl fragments of n-butane. For 13CH3-12CH2-12 CH2-13CH3 the propyl fragment contains one 13C atom, i.e. m/z=44. The emergence of the m/z=45 peak after some reaction time shows that an internal rearrangement of C atoms takes place which positions 13C atoms into methylene groups, so that a propyl fragment with two 13C atoms is formed in the ioniza- tion chamber. For the four catalyst samples of this study the estimated fractions of rearranged n-butane molecules after comparable conversion are as follows: A: 25%; B: 13%; C: 6%; D: 6%. This place exchange of C atoms in n-butane had been reported previously for labeled butane in strong liquid acids [14,15] and over SZ [11]. The rate of this process is lower than that of n-butane isomerization to iso-butane. 4. Discussion The results clearly indicate extensive isotopic scrambling in agreement with the intermolecular mechanism. The distribution pattern also provides some interesting clues to the detailed mechanism. As the feed molecule has two lZc and two 13C atoms, a binomial distribution of the five isotopic product molecules would indicate that every carbon atom in iso-butane has a 50% chance of being either isotope. Such was the case for the isomerization product 240 E Adeeva, W.M.H. Sachtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 237-243 obtained over the SZ catalyst. The reaction product over the present alumina-based catalysts deviates from this pattern: There is a significant excess of the molecule with two 13C atoms in the reaction product. Two models might be considered to rationalize the finding: 1. Two parallel reactions occur, one intermolecular process leading to a binomial distribution of the isotope label, and one truly intramolecular process retaining the 13C212C2 feed composition in the product. 2. The isomerization process is entirely intermolecu- lar, but the individual isomerization and C-C fission steps do not add up to a 50/50 chance for every carbon atom in the product to consist of either isotope. The former model appears inconsistent with the results for catalysts A, C, and D. If one assumes a linear combination of two product families and uses the measured 13C3 product (which cannot be formed by an intramolecular rearrangement) to calculate the fraction of the product which is formed via the bimolecular route, a much higher percentage results for the 13C4 peak than is actually measured. Note that the 13C4 peak is the most reliable one, as no fragments from other molecules interfere with it in the mass spectrum. Therefore, a closer inspection of the individual steps leading to isomerization via the bimolecular route appears useful. For simplicity we shall consider two extreme scenarios although they are not mutually exclusive. With the n-butane feed used in this work for all methyl groups containing a 13C atom and all methylene groups containing a 12C atom these sce- narios are described as follows: 13CH3 .,CH Scheme 1. 13CH2~ tCH~ CH L~t-~ 2 ~A3 2-@~@CH ~ 13(21-12 -- 13CH3 13CH ~CH2~ I3CH3 / +Q)/ CH~ CH Scheme 2. formation of a secondary carbenium ion with inverted position of two C atoms (see Scheme 2). If this internal C atom rearrangement is extremely fast, one might expect that in the C8 intermediate rather facile hydride and methyl shifts would suffice to create a random distribution of 13C and 12C atoms in this intermediate. This situation would lead to a binomial distribution of the product molecules after ~-fission of the C8 ion into two C4 entities. Clearly, this scenario is at variance with the present results. The rate of internal C atom rearrangement is lower than the isomerization rate, both for the present catalysts and for SZ. Interestingly, the catalyst with the highest extent of C atom rearrangement in n-butane (sample A) gives the strongest deviation from the binomial distribution of the iso-C4 molecules. While internal C atom rearrangement is of some help in randomizing C atoms of different isotopes, the extent of intermole- cular scrambling will have to be discussed in terms of the second scenario. 4.1. Scenario A 4.2. Scenario B Internal carbon atom rearrangement in the C4 enti- ties, prior to the formation of a C8 intermediate, is significant. Previously, Brouwer et al. [14,15] showed that this rearrangement of C4 carbenium ions takes place easily in liquid strong acids, a protonated cyclopropane intermediate is formed by internal ring closure between a C atom in one of the methyl groups and a secondary C atom carrying a positive charge (see Scheme 1). Rupture of a C-C bond then leads to Formation of scrambled iso-C4 structures by iso- merization and ~-fission of the C~ ion is considered, disregarding prior C atom rearrangement in n-C4 For this scenario the precise structure of the C~- ion is crucial. One can assume that it is initially formed from a but-2-ene molecule and a secondary C+ ion, each having terminal 13C and internal 12C atoms (see Scheme 3) In this intermediate all four terminal groups contain a 13C atom, all internal groups a 12C atom.

For isomers of this class, ~- fission can lead only to a secondary C4 carbenium ion and an isobutylene molecule. Each of these units contains two 13C atoms; no isotopic scrambling takes place. Hydride transfer from an alkane molecule to the secondary carbenium ion will lead to a n-butane molecule indistinguishable from the feed; hydrogena- tion of the iso-butylene gives isobutane with two 13C atoms. Clearly, Cs formation is not a sufficient con- dition for isotopic scrambling. However, ~-fission leading to a secondary carbe- nium ion is not an energetically favorable reaction path. It is well known that H-fission is much easier if a new tertiary carbenium ion is formed in the process. This requires presence of a quaternary C atom in the C+ ion. Indeed such a structure can be formed via a protonated cyclopropane ring intermediate as shown in Scheme 4. A simple hydride shift transforms this trimethyl- pentyl carbocation into a tertiary carbenium ion which is known to split easily into two fragments, each having an iso-C4 structure (Scheme 5). Even in this scenario there is a greater chance that each of the two iso-C4 fragments still contains two 13C atoms, i.e. that no C atom scrambling would be observed. There is, however, one variant of this scenario which does lead to scrambling. Opening of the pro- tonated cyclopropane ring in the C8 intermediate shown above creates a new terminal C atom in addi- tion to the four that were present in the initial C8 ion and that all contain a ~3C atom. Assuming that this new 12C methyl group can exchange its position with one of the existing 13C methyl groups, three 13C atoms will be present in one half of the C~ ion (Scheme 6). The/3-fission of this 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl carboca- tion will result in two fragments with iso-C4 structure, one containing three 13C atoms, the other one 13C atom (Scheme 7). Indeed, a 1 : 1 ratio of the product molecules with one and three labels was found in the present work. In conclusion, the present work shows that the predominant mechanism of butane isomerization over catalysts on the basis of chlorided alumina is an intermolecular mechanism. Extensive scrambling of the isotopic label suggests that the n-butane precursor 242 V. Adeeva, ~M.H. Sachtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 237-243 13CH3 13CH3 I3CH3--C~CH ~13 D.

The isotopic scrambling of the iso-butane product and the near equality of the relative abun- dances of product molecules with one or three label atoms suggest that in the C8 intermediate a structure with a quaternary carbon atom is formed and that extensive hydride and methyl shifts take place prior to 3-fission. These isomerization steps do not, however, lead to a random distribution of the C atoms of either label in the C+ ion, as they apparently do at the surface of SZ. A word of caution should be added to this discus- sion. In this paper, reaction intermediates have been written as carbocations, disregarding the differences v Adeeva, W.M.H. Saehtler/Applied Catalysis A: General 163 (1997) 237-243 243 between chemisorbed species and solvated or free carbocations. In this terminology, all feasible reaction paths make use of secondary, and tertiary carbenium ions and protonated cyclopropane rings, but primary carbenium ions are avoided. The question then arises why the formation of the three-membered ring in Scheme 1 is slightly slower than that in Scheme 4. We believe that the answer lies in the difficulty of forming C3 rings by bonding a C atom carrying a positive charge with a methyl group. As shown in [15] it is much easier to isomerize 2-methylpentane to 2,3- dimethylbutane than to n-hexane. Formally, both iso- merizations can be written via a cyclopropane inter- mediate, but in the latter case a primary C atom in a methyl group is required to bond to a C+ atom.

Mechanism of butane isomerization over industrial isomerization catalysts Valeria Adeeva Wolfgang M.H. Sachtler * V.N. Ipatieff Laboratory, Center for Catalysis and Surface Science, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA * Corresponding author. Tel.: +1 708 4914354; fax: +708 4917713. Double labeled 1,4-13C butane,13CH3-12CH2-12CH2-13CH3 was used to test four industrial isomerization catalysts based on chlorinated alumina. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the iso-butane product shows that extensive intermolecular scrambling occurs in the conversion from n- to iso-butane. Apparently, the reaction mechanism over these catalysts involves a bimolecular reaction, leading to an adsorbed C8 + intermediate. At low conversion, the fragmentation pattern of n-butane reveals an intramolecular rearrangement of carbon atoms, i.e. place exchange of C atoms in methyl and methylene groups. Both phenomena had been observed previously for sulfated zirconia (SZ) catalysts; however, for the present catalysts the distribution of the five isotopic iso-butane molecules does not obey the binomial law. The results suggest that isomerization of the C8 intermediate is less extensive than over sulfated zirconia; β-fission of the 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl ion leads to two fragments with iso-butyl structure with (2+n) and (2−n)13C atoms, respectively.
