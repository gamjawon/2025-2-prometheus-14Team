Preparation of unsupported catalysts Charles G. Hill, Jr.* and James H. Wilson m** Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, 1415 Johnson Drive, Madison, WI 53706 (U.SJL} (Received February 16, 1990; accepted May 22, 1990) Abstract Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize unsupported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts of the type used for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Bulk catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation from solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. The Raman spectra of the catalysts contained bands characteristic of Fea(Mo04)3 and MoOa. For unsupported catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios greater than 1.5, the relative intensities of the MoOg and Fe2(Mo04)3 peaks in the Raman spectra were approximately proportional to the corresponding atomic ratio. These catalysts are comprised ofFe2(Mo04)3 and MoOg which are formed in the calcination step of the preparation protocol. Raman spectra indicate that a solid phase reaction begins as the precipitates are heated at 105 C. At 125 C Raman bands characteristic of FeaCMoO-Oa were observed. At 250 C bands corresponding to Mo03 appeared. In situ and ex situ spectroscopic studies were used to obtain further information about the influence of variations in the preparation protocol on the properties of the final catalysts. Introduction Formaldehyde is manufactured by the partial oxidation of methanol over iron molybdate catalysts under fuel-lean conditions at temperatures near 350 C. Adkins and Peterson [1] first prepared this type of catalyst in 1931 but the related industrial process was not commercialized until the 1950s. Annual production on aworldwide basis now exceeds 12,000,000 metric tons. Despite the widespread industrial application of mixed metal oxide catalysts, compa- ratively little is known about either the molecular processes involved in catalytic acts on such surfaces or the fundamental nature of the solid surface. In our research, Raman spectroscopy was used to study the effects of different preparation variables on fundamental chemical, physical and catalytic properties of Fe/Mo/0 catalysts. The preparation of such catalysts involves precipitation of solids from aqueous solutions. These precipitates are extremely difficult to characterize in situ with most spectroscopic techniques. However, *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. \" Current address: Westvaco, Laurel, MD, U.SA. 0304-6102/90/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 66 Raman spectroscopy is ideal for investigating these systems because the precipitates may be examined in aqueous suspension without interference from the presence of water. The research reported in the present paper represents one aspect of a multi-faceted effort in our laboratory designed to obtain an increased un- derstanding of the multicomponent oxide catalysts employed in commercial practice. Previous papers emanating from this effort have focused on bismuth molybdates [2, 3] and the interactions of MoOa with various oxide supports [4]. Companion papers describing the results of our Raman studies of the preparation of supported iron molybdate catalysts [5] and of both supported and unsupported catalysts under in situ conditions [6] have also been submitted for publication. Preparation of the catalyst Iron forms two molybdates, ferrous molybdate [FeMo04] and ferric molybdate [FeaCMot^s] [7]. Alessandrini et al. [8] have reported that the ferric form is the active component in the iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts used for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Therefore only preparative methods for the ferric form [1, 9 25] are of interest here. The atomic ratio of molybdenum to iron which gives rise to the maximum activity remains an open question. Different research groups have claimed that optimum activities are achieved at ratios ranging from ca. 1.7 to ca. 4.05 [16, 17, 20, 22]. Most of the iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts used by industry have an Mo/Fe ratio in the range from 2.4 to 3.0. The composition of the finished catalyst depends on several variables, including the concentrations and relative amounts of the precursor solutions employed in the precipitation step, the pH and the variation of pH with time during the precipitation step, the temperature at which precipitation occurs, and the time for which the precipitate is allowed to age in contact with the mother liquor [8, 16, 20, 23]. The experimental protocols used to wash, dry and calcine the catalyst also influence the nature of the finished catalyst [21, 23]. In addition to studies of unsupported Fe/Mo/0 catalyst systems, several researchers have prepared and investigated versions of these catalysts sup- ported on silica and alumina [13, 14, 25-27]. Raman spectra of ferric molybdates Raman spectroscopy is a technique which has been used by a number of research groups to investigate both supported and unsupported catalysts containing MoOa or various molybdates [13, 28-41]. Very few Raman spectra of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts have appeared in the literature. Hazle et al. [35] are among the few to have published a Raman spectrum of ferric molybdate. They reported that the strongest band in the spectrum of Fe2CMoC>4)3 (at 780 cm\"1) is due to a Mo O Mo vibration. Villa et al. [19] have investigated the properties of a Bi-doped iron molybdate using Mossbauer, infrared, attenuated total reflectance, diffuse 67 reflectance, X-ray and Raman spectroscopies. They attributed a Raman band at 860 cm\"1 to Mo-^O stretching and a band at 530 cm\"1 to Mo O Mo bending. Our results and those of Hazle et al. [35] indicate that for pure ferric molybdate no band appears in the Raman spectrum at or around 530 cm~1. Forzatti et al. [15] have also published Raman spectra of FeaCMot^a as part of an investigation of the properties of Bi-doped iron molybdates. They reported that shoulders in the Raman spectrum of FeaCMoC^a at 820 and 990 cm~1 are consistent with trace amounts of molybdenum octahedrally coordinated with oxygen. In a study of the Bi Fe Mo 0 system Grzybowska et al. [34] collected Raman spectra of preparations with the atomic compositions Bi/Mo/Fe 3/2/ 1 and 1/1/1. They found that the Raman spectra of the two preparations were identical even though XPS studies indicated different compounds were present. Cairati et al. [13] have published Raman spectra of iron molybdate supported on SiOa and AlgOs. They assigned the bands at 800 and 960 cm~1 respectively to the Mo O Mo and Mo==0 vibrations associated with FegCMoC^a structures and bands at 820 and 1000 cm~1 to the Mo O Mo and Mo=0 vibrations associated with Mo03 species. Experimental Laser Raman system The Raman spectrometer was a Spex Ramalog 5 (Model 14018) system equipped with a third monochromator to resolve weak bands near the exciting line. The spectrometer was interfaced with a DEC PDP-11/03 minicomputer system to facilitate data acquisition and manipulation. All spectra were recorded using the 488.0 nm line of the argon laser for excitation. A rotating lens assembly was used to minimize sample degradation due to localized heating of the catalyst sample by the laser beam [2, 42-45]. A variety of sample cells are available for use with this apparatus. Spectra may be obtained from samples in controlled atmospheres at elevated tem- peratures and under in situ conditions in a flow reactor as well as at ambient conditions. Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, all spectra were recorded using the rotating lens assembly with the sample cup at ambient conditions. The Raman spectra reported in this paper were recorded at a resolution of 5 cm\"1 (slit width 365 JU,, slit height 20 mm), a laser power of 200 mW for the 488 nm line of argon, and a step size of 1.5 cm~1 per datum. The collection times and number of scans were adjusted as appropriate to obtain high quality spectra. Materials Stock solutions of molybdenum were prepared by dissolution of (NH4)eMo7024'4H20 in distilled water. Stock solutions of ferric ion were 68 prepared by dissolution of Fe(NOa)3 QHgO in distilled water. All chemicals employed were reagent grade or better. General preparation procedure Most of the unsupported (bulk) Fe Mo 0 catalysts used in this study were prepared by coprecipitation of iron and molybdenum oxides from solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. In a typical preparation procedure a solution of ammonium molybdate was prepared by dissolving (NH4)6Mo7024-4HaO in distilled water. FeCW^s 9HaO was also dissolved in distilled water to produce a ferric nitrate solution. The ferric nitrate solution was added to the ammonium molybdate solution at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for several hours before the resulting precipitate was filtered, washed, and dried. Finally, the dried precipitate was calcined to produce an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst. The variables in the preparation procedure which were investigated are summarized in Table 1. The general nature of the preparation procedure is indicated in the paragraph below. Specific aspects of the procedures employed which are relevant to analysis of the data are deferred to the Results and discussion section. Solute concentrations varied from 0.01 to 0.16 molal for the ammonium molybdate solutions and 0.16 to 4.0 molal for the ferric nitrate solutions. Most samples were prepared by adding the ferric nitrate solution to the ammonium molybdate solution. However, occasionally the ammonium mo- lybdate solution was added to the ferric nitrate solution in order to determine if this affected the final product. Various methods were used to mix the two solutions. For some samples the ferric nitrate solution was added to the ammonium molybdate solution slowly with vigorous stirring. For other samples the ferric nitrate solution was added quickly. Although most of the precipitations were carried out at room temperature, some were performed at elevated temperatures. Generally the pH of the slurry was not controlled but occasionally ammonium hydroxide or nitric acid was used to adjust the pH. The natural pH values of the aqueous precursor solutions were typically 5.4 for ammonium molybdate and 1.3 for ferric nitrate. The pH of these solutions varied by TABLE 1 Variables in the preparation of unsupported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts by coprecipitation ratio of chemical precursors concentrations of parent solutions temperature of solutions pH of solutions order of solution addition during precipitation length of reaction or precipitate aging filtration versus evaporation to dryness precipitate washing drying time and temperature calcination time and temperature 69 0.5 unit as the concentration of the solutions was changed. The pH of the slurry that resulted from mixing the two solutions was generally between 1.2 and 1.9. There was a large variation in the way different samples were washed, filtered and dried. Some slurries were allowed to evaporate to dryness without any filtering and washing steps. Others were vacuum filtered on a Buchner funnel and washed with distilled or acidified distilled water. Some samples were calcined wet. However, most samples were first dried at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100 C. The slurry resulting from mixing the ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate solutions varied in color and consistency. When both the ferric nitrate and the ammonium molybdate were present in low concentrations in the precursor solutions, a milky yellow suspension formed immediately on mixing. However, the solid particles formed were so fine that they passed through a very fine filter paper (Whatman #50). After aging overnight, the slurry could be filtered in a Buchner runnel under vacuum. When the precursor solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate were both high in solute concentration, a thick green-yellow gelatinous mass was formed on mixing. This substance could not be stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Addition of water served to liquefy the mass and facilitate stirring. If a sample of the undiluted gel-like substance was transferred directly to a Buchner runnel, very little liquid could be drawn off. When left to dry, this substance diminished approximately 8-fold in volume. By contrast, the chalky yellow precipitate obtained from mixing low concentration stock solutions retained approximately the same volume when dried. Samples were calcined at temperatures ranging from 125 to 750 C for 1 to 64 h. Mo/Fe determination via ICP-AES The Mo/Fe ratios of the finished unsupported catalyst samples were measured using ICP AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy). The instrument used was a Beckman, Spectra Metrics, SpectraSpan IV Emission Spectrometer. Samples of the solid bulk catalyst were dissolved using the following procedure. For a typical sample 0.17 to 0.19 g unsupported catalyst were placed in a 100 ml volumetric flask. Then 3 ml concentrated NH40H was added. The solid would rapidly turn from pale yellow-green to a deep rust- red color. After 5 to 10 min the NH40H was diluted with 20 ml of distilled water. Five ml concentrated HC1 was diluted with 20 ml distilled water and then slowly added to the 100 ml sample flask. The catalyst samples were usually completely dissolved within 0.5 to 1 h. When the sample had dissolved, the solution was diluted to a volume of 100 ml. With the ICP-AES instrument, the 281.615 nm 80th order line was used for detection of molybdenum and the 238.204 nm 94th order line for detection of iron. Using these lines, the linear dynamic range for the measurement of both Mo and Fe concentrations was 0.2 to 1000 mg 1~1. Ricca Chemical 70 Co. molybdenum and iron standards (1000 mg 1~1) were used to calibrate the instrument. The samples were diluted so as to achieve a concentration near 1000 mg 1~1 for the more concentrated metal (usually Mo). Each sample was run a minimum of three times and the results were averaged. The measured concentrations of iron and molybdenum in a given solution were accurate to within 5% for a single measurement. The Mo and Fe concentrations of each sample were ratioed in order to obtain the desired Mo/Fe ratio. Since the same sample was used to measure both the Mo and Fe concentrations used in calculating the Mo/Fe ratio, errors in weighing and diluting the sample solutions will not affect the accuracy of the results. Results and discussion Since a major focus of this investigation was a study of the relationship between the preparation conditions and the physical and chemical properties of the finished mixed oxide, Raman spectra were collected at several stages of the preparation protocol. Table 2 contains a summary of the Raman band assignments for molybdenum trioxide and ferric molybdate. Correlation of .Raman peak intensity ratios with Mo/Fe atomic ratios Raman spectra of Fe Mo 0 catalysts prepared under a variety of conditions were collected. All of the catalysts displayed bands characteristic of Fe2(Mo04)3. The presence of an FeO or Fea03 phase could not be detected via Raman spectroscopy because the iron oxides did not produce any significant Raman bands. However, catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios greater than the ratio of 1.5 required for stoichiometric FeaCMot^g had additional peaks which were attributed to the formation of a MoOg phase in the solid catalyst. The relative intensities of these MoOg peaks were found to increase as the amount of 'excess' Mo increased.

The bands at 816 and 992 cm\"1 arise primarily from MoOs vibrations while those at 782 and 966 cm\"1 are Fe2(Mo04)3 peaks. The ratio of the intensity of a MoOa peak to the intensity of an FeaCMo04)3 peak should vary in proportion to the mole ratio of MoOs to Fe2(Mo04)3 in the sample. If one assumes that all of the iron is used to form Fe^MoO^y and that any 'excess' molybdenum forms MoOg, then the mole ratio of MoOa to Fe2(Mo04)3 is linear in the Mo/Fe atom ratio in the sample. A plot of the ratio of the intensity of the 992 cm\"! Raman band to the intensity of the 966 cm~1 peak versus the Mo/Fe atomic ratio of the bulk catalyst sample as determined by ICP AES can be fit with a straight line which has a correlation coefficient of 0.921. Similarly, a plot of the ratio of the intensity of the 816 cm~1 peak to that of the 782 cm~1 peak versus the Mo/Fe atomic ratio has a correlation coefficient of only 0.878. In both cases, the deviations from linearity are appreciable. Some, but not all, of these deviations can be accounted for by measurement errors in the data. The prominent bands in the Raman spectra fo the catalysts are associated with MoOg and Fea(Mo04)3 species. Therefore, if some of the iron or molybdenum were present in some other form, an inaccurate estimate of the Mo/Fe ratio in a catalyst would be obtained from the Raman peak ratios. Such a situation might arise if the catalyst sample was not completely calcined. In said case, the reaction in which the catalyst precursor is transformed into the finished catalyst would be incomplete. Therefore not all of the molybdenum and iron in such a sample would be present in the form of MoOa and Fe2(Mo04)3. Hence, although a rough estimate of the Mo/Fe ratio in a catalyst can be obtained from its Raman spectrum, accurate quantitative determinations of Mo/Fe ratios in iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts cannot be obtained from such measurements. Spectra, of solid precursors and wet precipitate Figure 1 displays the Raman spectra of crystalline ammonium molybdate [(NH4)eMo7024-4H20] (A), ferric nitrate FeCNC^a 9HaO (B), and the pre- cipitate that results from mixing aqueous solutions of these two salts (C). The only Raman band in the spectrum of the precipitate that is obviously related to any of those in the spectra of the original salts is the nitrate peak at 1045 cm~1. It is difficult to make definitive band assignments for the precipitate. The precipitate, hereafter referred to as the catalyst precursor, contains ammonium and nitrate ions, and polymolybdate species which form and drop out of solution at low pH.

Most, though not all, catalyst precursors 'grew' a peak at 900 cm\"1 upon drying. The presence or absence of this peak had no apparent effect on the character of the spectrum of the final catalyst. Unlike the Raman spectrum of the final catalyst, the spectrum of the precursor was not altered by changes in the ratio of molybdenum to iron within the experimental limits of 1.5 to 3.0. In-situ Raman studies of the effect of heating the catalyst precursor Figure 3 depicts the transformation that occurs when the precipitate that results from mixing solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate is heated in air. Note that all of the relevant Raman spectra have been normalized to the same magnitude. These spectra indicate the series of molecular transformations which occur during the genesis of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. A naive reading of the literature might indicate that it is the original precipitate which is catalytically active. However, these spectra clearly indicate that changes are occurring on an atomic level during the calcination step of the catalyst preparation protocol. Spectrum A, which was collected at room temperature, is that of the precipitate after it was dried in air at 75 C. The bands in this spectrum 73 Fig. 2. Raman spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst and the wet and dry catalyst precursors. Samples: (A) wet catalyst precursor (B) dry catalyst precursor. (C) Fe Mo 0 catalyst. can be attributed to ferric nitrate or polymolybdate species. In addition to a peak at 516 cm~1, ferric nitrate also has a peak at 730 cm\"1 which appears as a slight shoulder on the high side of the band at 714 cm~1. The band at 360 cm\"1 is usually associated with bending of terminal Mo=0 groups, while bands at lower wavenumbers are generally attributed to bridging Mo 0 deformation vibrations. However, the band at 240 cm\"1 also coincides with a ferric nitrate band. The precipitate used to obtain Spectrum A was heated in situ to 90 C. Then Spectrum B was collected at the elevated temperature. The absolute Raman intensity (photon counts per second) was greatly reduced in Spectrum B relative to Spectrum A. However, there are no other significant differences between Spectra A and B, since the positions of the bands and their relative magnitudes do not change. After Spectrum B was collected, the temperature of the catalyst sample was raised to 105 C. The changes between Spectra B and C all occurred in the first 4 h at 105 C. The two broad bands in Spectrum C (centered at 782 and 955 cm~1) will later grow and resolve into the characteristic peaks of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts. Spectrum C is an average of 23 Raman scans collected over 14 h following the initial 4 h at 105 C. No 74 BAMAN SHIFT (cm-') Fig. 3.

Sample cell: rotating lens with in situ reactor cell open to air. further significant changes in the Raman spectrum were detected in this subsequent 14 h period. The temperature of the sample was then raised to 120 C. At a temperature of 120 C, a solid phase reaction slowly occurred during which the catalyst was formed. The changes that took place in the spectrum of the catalyst sample, as manifested by Spectra D, E, and F, are evidence for this solid phase reaction. The growth of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst from the precursor is even more evident if one notes that the absolute Raman intensity increases by several orders of magnitude in pro- ceeding from Spectrum D to Spectrum H. Inspection of Fig. 3 clearly indicates that a dramatic increase in the signal-to-noise ratio occurs on proceeding from Spectra D and E to Spectra F and G. The precursor material has a relatively weak Raman spectrum, compared to the mixed oxide catalyst which is an excellent Raman scatterer. 75 Spectra D, E, and F were all collected at 120 C. After 8 h at 120 C, the spectrum of the sample no longer appeared to change with time. Spectrum F differs from that of a hot oxidized iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst only in the presence of a peak at 1040 cm\"1. It was necessary to raise the temperature of the sample to ~230 C in order to get rid of the nitrate peak at 1045 cm\"1 and obtain the iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst. Spectrum G in Fig. 3 is that of the sample after it had been heated at 230 C for 18 h. Spectrum H is that of the sample once it had cooled back down to room temperature. Spectrum H is virtually identical to the spectrum of the sample at 230 C, except that the absolute Raman intensity of the spectrum at elevated temperatures was about one half the intensity of the spectrum after the sample had cooled. Other samples of the precipitate were calcined in an oven. Raman spectra collected before and after calcination indicate that at a temperature of 500 C the same reaction occurs, only at a much higher rate. Less than 1 h is required to effect this change at 500 C as opposed to the several hours necessary to accomplish the change at 230 C. At a temperature of 750 C other changes occur in addition to those caused by the solid state reaction referred to above. At 750 C evidence for the segregation of metallic-like crystals from the catalyst was obtained. These effects will be treated in conjunction with the discussion of the effects of calcination time and tem- perature. Effects a/preparation variables on the finished unsupported catalysts Concentrations of the parent solutions and filtration Some catalysts were prepared by drying the slurry which resulted from mixing solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate, rather than just drying the precipitate obtained by filtering the slurry. ICP-AES measurements indicated that there is a direct relationship between the ratio of the original reagents and the Mo/Fe ratio of the final catalyst for catalysts which were produced by evaporating the precursor slurry to dryness. For catalysts which were produced by filtration of the slurry, the Mo/Fe ratio in the final catalyst is only roughly related to the ratio of the original reagents. The Mo/Fe ratio in these catalysts also appears to be influenced by the concentrations of the parent solutions, the washing procedure and the pH history of the slurry. The effects of these variables are discussed below. For preparation procedures that did not involve filtration, the slurries were typically dried at temperatures between 20 and 85 C. Within experimental accuracy, this preparation procedure was found to consistently produce catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios equal to the ratio of molybdenum to iron in the reagents employed. For catalysts prepared by drying the slurry, changes in the concentrations of the ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate solutions did not appear to affect the Raman spectra of the finished catalysts. Bulk catalysts having Mo/ Fe atomic ratios of 1.7 and 3.0 were prepared via the drying method, using solute concentrations from 0.05 to 0.16 molal for the ammonium molybdate 76 solutions and 0.69 to 4.0 molal for the ferric nitrate solutions. For each Mo/Fe ratio, the Raman spectra of all the catalyst samples prepared by the drying method were identical. This result contrasts sharply with the results obtained from catalyst samples prepared by nitration. Catalysts which were prepared by filtering the precipitate which resulted from mixing solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate were affected by changes in the concentrations of the parent solutions. Raman spectra of catalysts which were prepared from more dilute solutions were found to have MoOa peaks of greater relative intensities than the corresponding peaks of catalysts which were prepared from relatively concentrated solutions. Raman spectra were recorded for three catalysts, all of which are characterized by a nominal Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.7. One catalyst was prepared by mixing a relatively dilute ammonium molybdate solution (0.013 g (NH4)eMo7024 4HaO per ml water) with a dilute ferric nitrate solution (0.065 g Fe(N03)3'9HaO per ml water). A second catalyst was prepared by mixing a concentrated solution of ammonium molybdate (0.067 g (NH4)gMo7024-4H20 per ml water) with a concentrated solution of ferric nitrate (0.543 g Fe^O^^HgO per ml water). For the second catalyst the intensities of the 992 and the 966 cm~1 peaks are approximately equal, while in the spectrum of the first catalyst the intensity of the 992 cm~1 peak is greater than that of the 966 cm\"1 peak. This difference is an indication that the actual Mo/Fe ratio in the samples prepared from dilute solutions is greater than the Mo/Fe ratio in the sample prepared from concentrated solutions. Two possible explanations for this result exist: either more iron was washed away with the filtrate in the dilute preparation procedure or more molybdenum was washed away with the filtrate in the concentrated preparation procedure. ICP-AES analysis of the filtrates from these preparations indicated that more iron than mo- lybdenum is lost with the filtrate. A third catalyst was prepared by taking a sample of the slurry from which the precursor for the second catalyst was obtained by filtration, and evaporating this slurry to dryness. Comparison of spectra of the second and third catalysts reveals that the 992 cm\"1 peak is much smaller than the 966 cm~1 peak in the spectrum of the third catalyst. This result indicates that the Mo/Fe ratio of the second catalyst is greater than that of the third catalyst. Apparently some iron was washed away with the filtrate in the preparation of the second catalyst, while no iron was lost in the preparation of the third catalyst. Generally speaking, the final pH of the slurry that resulted from mixing solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate was between 1.2 and 1.9. These numbers lie within the range of pH values of the precursor ferric nitrate solutions and far below the pH values of the corresponding ammonium molybdate solutions. The natural pH of the ammonium molybdate solution was usually around 5.4. At the low final pH of the slurry, ferric nitrate will stay in solution indefinitely. However, at this same low pH, ammonium molybdate tends to precipitate. Therefore one expects almost complete 77 precipitation of the molybdenum and incomplete precipitation of the iron. When one removes the nitrate, more iron than molybdenum is lost, a situation which results in a higher Mo/Fe ratio in the residual solid. The preparation procedure that evaporates all of the liquid rather than filtering the precipitate does not cause a similar loss of iron. Temperature of solutions and precipitate aging Although bulk catalysts were prepared by procedures that involved different slurry temperatures and different precipitate aging times, the Raman data did not permit determination of the effects of changes in these preparation variables. pH of solutions and order of solution addition during precipitation To study the effects of the pH of the precursor solutions on the final catalyst, four identical sets of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate solutions were prepared. Each ammonium molybdate solution was prepared by dissolving 11.886 g (NH4)eMo7C>24-4H20 in 200 ml distilled water. Each ferric nitrate solution consisted of 16.000 g Fe(N03)3 9HaO dissolved in 25 ml distilled water. The initial pH of the ammonium molybdate solutions was 5.3, while the initial pH of the ferric nitrate solutions was 0.6. The ratio of the reagents in these solutions was such that use of all of the molybdenum and iron in a solution set would yield an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst with a Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.7. These solutions were mixed in four different ways, then filtered, dried at room temperature and calcined at 500 C for 1 h. Figure 4 depicts the Raman spectra of the four finished catalysts. For the catalyst corresponding to Spectrum A, the ferric nitrate solution was quickly added to the ammonium molybdate solution with vigorous stirring. This method resulted in a greenish-yellow slurry with a pH of 1.2. The mixture was left at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer overnight. The next day the pH of the slurry had risen to 1.7. The solutions for the catalyst corresponding to Spectrum B were mixed in the same manner as in case A. However, after the solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate were mixed, the pH of the slurry was raised to 2.0 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide. The addition of ammonium hydroxide caused the slurry to take on an orange tint and to become thicker than the slurry in case A. This mixture was also left on a magnetic stirrer overnight. By the next day the pH of this slurry had risen to 2.3. Comparison of Spectra A and B in Figure 4 reveals that, despite the different pH histories, the Raman spectra of these two finished catalysts are identical. The catalyst which corresponds to Spectrum C in Fig. 4 was prepared by slowly adding the ammonium molybdate solution to the ferric nitrate solution. The initial pH of the ferric nitrate solution was less than 1. The pH of the slurry rose as the ammonium molybdate was added. It reached a final pH of 1.7. This mixture thickened as it aged. After 2 h the mixture had set like gelatin. Despite the different mixing procedure and the different 78 1200 BOO 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 4.

The precursor for the catalyst which corresponds to Spectrum D in Fig. 4 was precipitated at a constant pH of 2. This precipitation was accomplished by dropping the pH of the ammonium molybdate solution from 5.3 to 2 by adding nitric acid. Then the ferric nitrate solution was added dropwise, with alternate drops of ammonium hydroxide as needed to keep the pH constant at 2. It was also necessary to periodically add drops of ammonium hydroxide to maintain a constant pH of 2 even after all of the ferric nitrate solution had been added to the slurry. The final slurry had an orange-yellow color similar to that of the slurry prepared for the catalyst characterized by Spectrum B. Comparison of Spectrum D to Spectra A, B and C in Fig. 4 reveals that the relative intensities of the peaks in Spectrum D are different. Despite the fact that the ratio of molybdenum to iron in the original reagents used to create catalyst D was 1.7, the Raman spectrum of catalyst D indicated that 79 the finished catalyst has a Mo/Fe ratio closer to 3.0. On the other hand, for Spectra A, B, and C, the intensities of the bands associated with Mo03 relative to those that appear only in spectra of FeaCMoC^a are characteristic of an iron/molybdenum catalyst with a Mo/Pe ratio close to 1.7. These results are in agreement with those of Alessandrini et al. [8], who reported that if the pH is held constant during precipitation by adding NH40H and Fe(NOs)3 simultaneously with vigorous stirring to the Mo solution, the Mo/Fe ratio of the precipitate is approximately constant (regardless of the Mo/Fe ratio in the parent solutions). Alessandrini et al. also reported that a change in the Mo/Fe ratio of the parent solutions will result in a change in the Mo/Fe ratio in the precipitate when the pH is allowed to vary during precipitation even if the final pH is brought to the same value. These results can be explained as follows. Iron tends to precipitate from a solution of ferric nitrate at high pH values, while molybdenum tends to precipitate from a solution of ammonium molybdate at low pH values. Ferric nitrate solutions have a pH in the range from less than 1 for concentrated solutions up to 1.8 for dilute solutions. Ammonium molybdate solutions have a pH in the range of 5 to 5.5, with lower pH values being associated with more dilute solutions. In cases A and B, the ferric nitrate solution was added to the ammonium molybdate solution. These approaches resulted in a brief exposure of much of the iron to the relatively high pH environment of the ammonium molybdate solution. This high pH environment would be more conducive to the precipitation of iron than of molybdenum. As more ferric nitrate was mixed into the ammonium molybdate solution the pH dropped, thus encouraging the precipitation of molybdenum. Subsequent adjustment of the final pH from 1.2 to 2.0 in case B did not affect the final catalyst composition because most of the precipitation had already taken place. In case D the ferric ions were never exposed to the high pH environment typical of the parent ammonium molybdate solution, because the pH had been adjusted to 2 with nitric acid prior to the addition of ferric nitrate. A pH of 2 is more conducive to the precipitation of polymolybdate species than it is of ferric ions. Therefore the final catalyst produced by preparation procedure D had a higher Mo/Fe ratio than those catalysts produced by procedures A and B. Washing the precipitate Many of the preparation protocols for iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts described in the literature call for washing the precipitate on the filter [8, 12, 16, 19]. Comparison of the spectrum of a catalyst which was prepared by a process that included washing the precipitate with the spectrum of a catalyst which was prepared by the same process excluding the washing step reveals that in the former case the bands associated with MoOs are much stronger relative to the FeaCMoC^a bands than they are in the latter. This result indicates that the catalyst that was prepared by washing the wet precursor has a larger Mo/Fe ratio than the catalyst that was prepared from an unwashed sample of the same precursor. Washing the precursor tends 80 to remove a greater percentage of the iron present in the precursor than it does of the molybdenum. ICP-AES analysis of the wash water used to wash a precursor sample confirmed this supposition. Both distilled water and water acidified to pH 2 with HNOa were used to wash wet precursor samples. No differences in the final catalysts produced by the different washing solutions were detected. Bartenev et al. [12] have indicated that the purpose of washing the wet catalyst precursor is to remove NH4+ from the catalyst precursor. N03\" is not removed by the washing procedure, as evidenced by the presence of the nitrate peak at 1045 cm\"1 in the Raman spectra of all of the catalyst precursors, m principle it should not be necessary to remove either NH4+ or NOa\" ions by washing, since both should be eventually removed by the calcination process. Drying time and temperature Wet catalyst precursors were dried at temperatures varying from room temperature (20 to 24 C) to 86 C. Catalyst precursors which were dried at room temperature often were different in physical appearance from catalyst precursors from the same batch which were dried at 70 or 85 C in an oven. Typically the oven-dried precursors were brittle, opaque brown solids, while the precursors dried at room temperature were glassy, translucent brownish- green or yellow solids. Despite the differences in physical appearance, the Raman spectra of the oven-dried catalyst precursors were identical to those of the precursors dried at room temperature. The Raman spectra of the final catalysts resulting from these preparations were also identical. Therefore it was concluded that for temperatures between 20 and 85 C the conditions under which the precursors are dried have no effect on the finished catalyst. As noted earlier, at temperatures in excess of 100 C the catalyst precursor begins to be transformed into an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst. Catalyst precursors which were dried at temperatures in excess of 100 C had Raman spectra which differed markedly from the spectra of precursors which were dried at temperatures of 85 C or less (see Fig. 5). Spectrum A in Fig. 5 is the spectrum of a typical catalyst precursor dried at a temperature of less than 85 C, while spectrum B is that of a precursor which has been subjected to temperatures greater than 100 C. Spectrum C corresponds to the finished catalyst obtained by calcination of the sample used to obtain Spectrum A. Spectrum B is obviously quite different from Spectra A and C. However, Spectrum B possesses some characteristics of the low temperature precursor spectrum (A) and some of the characteristics of the finished catalyst spectrum (C). Calcination of a wet precipitate Catalyst precursor samples with a nominal Mo/Fe atomic ratio of 1.7 were calcined directly from the wet state, thereby eliminating the drying step. The Raman spectra of these catalysts exhibited an increase in the intensities of bands associated with MoOs relative to the intensities of peaks 81 SOO 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm1) Fig. 5. Raman spectra of catalyst precursors subjected to different temperatures. Nominal composition: atomic Mo/Fe= 1.7. Samples B and C were prepared from samples of precursor A. (A) precursor dried at room temperature (24 C); (B) precursor after 12 days at 105 C; (C) finished Fe-Mo-0 catalyst, calcined 1 h at 500 C. which appear only in the spectrum of Fe2(MoC>4)3. Both the wet and the dried precursor samples were calcined at 500 C for 1 h. Inspection of the Raman spectra for these samples revealed that the intensity of the MoOs peak at 816 cm\"1 in the sample which was calcined directly from the wet state is somewhat larger, relative to the most intense Fea(Mo04)3 peak at 782 cm\"1, than the corresponding peak in the spectrum of the sample that was dried prior to calcination. This result could be interpreted as an indication that the sample used to collect the former spectrum had a larger Mo/Fe ratio than the sample used to collect the latter. Since these two catalysts were from the same precursor batch and it is unlikely that iron or molybdenum was lost from either catalyst, it is reasonable to assume that the actual bulk Mo/Fe ratios of the two catalysts are the same. Perhaps the wet calcination resulted in an enrichment of the MoOg phase near the surface of the catalyst without altering the overall Mo/Fe ratio of the bulk solid. However, no evidence for this possible surface enrichment has been collected. Attempts to obtain surface composition data from Auger spectra were unsuccessful due to charging effects. 82 Calcination time Samples of catalyst precursors were treated in a calcining oven for lengths of time varying from 1 to 64 h. Hainan spectra of the finished catalysts were collected after the calcination treatment. For calcination at 500 C the Raman spectra of the finished catalysts were not altered by varying the calcination time between 1 and 15 h. For calcination at 250 C, the Raman spectra of the finished catalysts did not change when the calcination time was increased from 2 h to 64 h. When a catalyst precursor was heated to 110 C the Raman spectrum of the precursor gradually changed during the first 3 h. Exposure of the sample to a temperature of 110 C for greater lengths of time (up to 19 h) caused no further changes in the Raman spectrum. Calcination temperature Eight catalyst precursors characterized by different Mo/Fe ratios were each divided into five parts which were, in turn, calcined at different tem- peratures (125, 250, 350, 500 and 750 C). Figure 6-9 contain some of the relevant Raman spectra. In order to achieve as nearly identical treatment for the samples as possible, all eight samples were calcined in one oven simultaneously at each calcination temperature. The time temperature combinations to which the samples were subjected were as follows: 125 C for 4 h, 250 C for 64 h, 350 C for 22 h, 500 C for 1 h and 750 C for 2 h. The colors of the samples tended to change as the calcination temperature was altered. Catalysts calcined at 500 C were a pale yellow-green, while catalysts calcined at lower temperatures were a darker green. Effects of calcination at low temperatures Figure 6 portrays the Raman spectra of samples of a precursor with a molybdenum to iron atom ratio of 1.8 which were calcined at the afore- mentioned temperatures. Spectrum A is that of a sample calcined at 125 C. It is similar to Spectrum F in Fig. 3, which was collected in situ during calcination at 120 C. Spectrum A differs from that characteristic ofFe Mo 0 catalysts in that the peak at 816 cm\"1 is reduced to a shoulder on the 782 cm\"1 band. The small peaks at 1045 and 864 cm~1 also do not appear in the spectrum of a typical Fe Mo 0 catalyst. The band at 1045 cm~1 indicates the presence of nitrate groups. Spectrum B, which is that of a sample calcined at 250 C, does not exhibit any features which are not characteristic of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst. A comparison of Spectra B, C and D in Fig. 6 shows that, as the calcination temperature was increased from 250 to 350 C and on to 500 C, there was a slight increase in the intensity of the 816 cm~1 peak relative to the 782 cm\"1 peak. As previously discussed, the ratio of the intensity of these two peaks can be used as a rough measure of the atomic ratio of molybdenum to iron in the catalyst. However, there was no difference in the Mo/Fe ratio of samples B, C and D to within the measurement error of the ICP AES instrument used to carry out the Mo/Fe ratio measurements. Spectrum E corresponds to that of a 83 Fig. 6. Raman spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst calcined at various temperatures. Nominal composition: atomic ratio Mo/Fe= 1.8. Sample (A) calcined 4 h at 125 C; (B) calcined 64 h at 250 C; (C) calcined 22 h at 350 C; (D) calcined 1 h at 500 C; (E) calcined 2 h at 750 C (Mo/Fe ratio dropped to 1.5). sample calcined at 750 C. It is virtually identical to Spectrum D which is that of a sample calcined at 500 C. Figure 7 is similar to Fig. 6 in that it depicts a series of spectra of samples calcined at different temperatures. The major difference between the samples whose spectra are depicted in Fig. 7 and those represented by Fig. 6 is that the precursor for the catalysts in Fig. 7 had a Mo/Fe ratio of 2.7, while the precursor for the catalysts in Fig. 6 had a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.8. Spectrum A in Fig. 7 corresponds to a sample calcined for 4 h at 125 C. This spectrum has some of the characteristics of a spectrum of an Fe Mo 0 catalyst and some of the characteristics of a spectrum of a catalyst precursor. It is clear that 4 h at 125 C was not sufficient to transform this precursor into a catalyst. Spectrum B is that of a sample calcined for 64 h at 250 C. Spectrum B exhibits more characteristics of a spectrum of an Fe Mo 0 catalyst than does Spectrum A. However, Spectrum B is still not that of a completely formed catalyst. It appears that even 64 h at 250 C was not a sufficiently rigorous calcination to bring about the solid phase reaction in which the catalyst is formed. 84 Fig. 7. Raman spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst calcined at various temperatures. Nominal composition: atomic ratio Mo/Fe=2.7. Sample (A) calcined 4 h at 125 C; (B) calcined 64 h at 250 C; (C) calcined 22 h at 350 \"C; (D) calcined 1 h at 500 \"C (Mo/Fe ratio increased to 3.0); (E) calcined 2 h at 750 C (Mo/Fe ratio dropped to 1.8). With one exception, all of the other samples were well on their way to becoming catalysts after 4 h at 125 C. These samples had spectra characteristic of Fe Mo 0 catalysts after calcination at 250 C. The exception was a precursor from the same batch as that used to generate the spectra in Fig. 7. The only difference between the two precursors was that the sample representing the exception was washed with distilled water before it was dried, while that employed to generate the spectra in Fig. 7 was not washed. The reason the precipitate from this particular batch required more rigorous calcination conditions is not known. Other precursor batches prepared under similar conditions did not exhibit the same behavior. The sample whose spectra are depicted in Fig. 8 has a Mo/Fe ratio of 2.4. However, this sample, like most samples tested, did not require tem- peratures of 350 C before its spectrum became one characteristic of Fe Mo 0 catalysts. The principal difference between the sample used in generating Fig. 7 and the one used in generating Fig. 8 is that the precipitate used in the former case was filtered and the filtrate discarded, while the excess liquid present in the sample used in generating Fig. 8 was simply evaporated. 85 Fig. 8. Raman spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst calcined at various temperatures. Nominal composition: atomic ratio Mo/Fe=2.4. Samples: (A) calcined 4 h at 125 C; (B) calcined 64 h at 250 C; (C) calcined 22 h at 350 C; (D) calcined 2 h at 500 C; (E) calcined 2 h at 750 C (Mo/Fe ratio increased to 2.6). Experiments in which samples were calcined for longer periods of time at 125 C resulted in Raman spectra which were similar to Spectrum A in Fig. 6. As noted when spectra were collected in situ as a sample was calcined, temperatures greater than 125 C were required to eliminate the nitrate peak at 1045 cm\"1 and obtain the final catalyst. In Fig. 10 Raman spectra of catalyst precursor samples calcined at 125 C are compared to spectra of the same precursor calcined at 500 C. Spectra A, C and E are characteristic of samples calcined at 125 C. These three spectra are remarkably similar, considering that Spectra A, C and E were obtained from samples with Mo/Fe ratios of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.4, respectively. The only significant difference between these spectra is that the spectrum of the sample with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.5 does not have a small peak at 864 cm\"1. All three spectra have a nitrate peak at 1045 cm\"1 and relative peak intensities which are characteristic of stoichiometric ferric molybdate. Since the 864 cm~1 band appears only in spectra of catalyst samples which have an excess of molybdenum with respect to that needed to form FcaCMoO^g, this peak is probably associated with some molybdenum compound. Spectra B, D and F pertain to samples calcined at 500 C. The intensity of the 816 cm\" i peak relative to the 782 cm~1 peak in Spectrum B is typical 86 800 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 9. Hainan spectra of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst calcined at various temperatures. Nominal composition: atomic ratio Mo/Fe = 1.6. Sample (A) calcined 4 h at 125 C; (B) calcined 64 h at 250 C; (C) calcined 22 h at 350 C; (D) calcined 2 h at 500 C; (E) calcined 2 h at 750 C (Mo/Fe ratio increased to 1.7). of a catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.5. The intensity of the 816 cm\"1 peak relative to the 782 cm\"1 peak is larger in Spectrum D than in Spectrum B. In Spectrum F the relative intensities of the two peaks have reversed, with the 816 cm\"1 peak becoming the more intense. These differences in the spectra of samples calcined at 500 C were expected because the samples have different Mo/Fe ratios. What was surprising was the discovery that, for samples calcined at 125 C, the intensity of the 816 cm~1 peak relative to that of the 782 cm~1 peak does not vary as the Mo/Fe ratio of the sample is changed. For samples with a Mo/Fe ratio greater than 1.5, it is thought that all of the iron is used to form FeaCMoC^s and that any excess molybdenum forms a MoOa phase. The evidence presented above indicates that a calcination temperature of 125 C is sufficient for a solid phase reaction to occur in which FeaCMoO^a is formed. However, since no MoOa peaks appear in the spectra of samples calcined at 125 C, this temperature is not adequate for the formation of a MoOs phase. The excess molybdenum in these samples must be present in some other form which is a weak Raman scatterer. A small peak at 864 cm~1 is the only indication given by the Raman spectra 87 1200 800 WO 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 10. Comparison of the Raman spectra of iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts calcined at 125 and 500 C. Samples: 3 catalysts, each calcined at the 2 different temperatures. Sample (A) calcined 4 h at 125 C, Mo/Fe= 1.5; (B) calcined 2 h at 500 C, Mo/Fe= 1.5; (C) calcined 4 h at 125 C, Mo/Fe= 1.7; (D) calcined 1 h at 500 C, Mo/Fe= 1.7; (E) calcined 4 h at 125 C, Mo/Fe=2.4; (F) calcined 2 h at 500 C, Mo/Fe=2.4. for the presence of a molybdenum compound other than FeaCMot^g in the samples calcined at 125 C. The spectra of the samples used to generate Figs. 6-9 all exhibited an increase in the relative intensity of the 816 cm\"1 peak and the appearance of other MoOs peaks when the calcination temperature was increased from 125 to 250 C. A further increase in calcination temperature from 250 to 350 C caused a further increase in the relative intensity of the 816 cm\"1 band. For some samples this increase was very slight, while for others it was quite dramatic. All of the catalyst precursors used in this study were prepared by precipitation of a solid from solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. For some of the precursors the excess liquid was removed by filtration, while other precursors were evaporated to dryness at moderate temperatures (usually 50 C). Of the precursors which were filtered, some were washed with distilled water while others were not. There is a correlation between the degree to which the Raman spectra change due to an increase in calcination temperature from 250 to 350 C and the precursor preparation protocol. Catalyst precursors which were prepared by evaporation to dryness 88 exhibited very slight increases in the intensity of MoOs bands relative to pure FeaCMoO^a bands. Catalysts which were filtered and washed displayed the largest increases in the relative intensities of the MoOa bands. Catalysts which were filtered but not washed generally had increases in the MoC>3 band intensities which lay somewhere between those mentioned previously. From these data it appears that a precursor which was evaporated to dryness can be fully calcined at a lower temperature than can a precursor which was filtered. Washing a filtered precursor creates another precursor which requires an even higher calcination temperature. For all samples, calcination of the precursors at 500 C resulted in relative MoOs band intensities which were higher than those of the same precursors calcined at 250 C. However, for some samples the intensities of the MoOs peaks relative to the FeaCMoO^a peaks of precursors calcined at 500 C were lower than those of precursors calcined at 350 C. Other samples exhibited an increase in the MoOs peak intensities when the precursor was calcined at 500 C rather than at 350 C. The changes in relative intensities of the MoOs bands resulting from the increase in calcination temperature from 350 to 500 C were not large. No correlation was found between the precursor preparation conditions and the increase or decrease in MoC>3 peak strength resulting from an increase in calcination temperature from 350 to 500 C. Effects of calcination at high temperatures Inspection of Figs. 6 9 to compare the spectra of catalysts calcined at 750 C with those of catalysts calcined at 500 C reveals that in some cases the spectra change with calcination temperature while in other cases they do not. The differences in the Raman spectra of samples heated to 750 C relative to the samples calcined at more moderate temperatures do not follow the same pattern (cf. Figs. 7 and 9). For the sample in Fig. 7 the Mo/Fe ratio (measured by ICP-AES) drops from 2.7 to 1.8 as a result of heating the sample to 750 C. The Raman spectra reflect this change by the reversal of the relative intensities of the 816 and the 780 cm\"1 peaks. In Fig. 6 where the Mo/Fe ratio drops from 1.7 to 1.4 as a result of heating the sample, the spectra do not display any significant changes. The Mo/Fe ratio of the sample in Fig. 9 increased from 1.5 to 1.7 as a result of calcination at 750 C. The spectra of this sample reflect this change by the increase in the relative intensities of bands associated with MoOg. Although the bulk Mo/Fe ratio of this sample increased to only 1.7, the Raman spectrum of the calcined catalyst has relative peak intensities that one would expect to see in the spectrum of a catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 2.7. This result could be an indication of MoOs enrichment of the outer layers of the catalyst granules. Figure 11 displays Raman spectra of three catalyst precursor samples calcined at 500 C compared to spectra of the same precursor calcined at 750 C. Spectra A, C and E are characteristic of samples calcined at 500 C while Spectra B, D and F pertain to the same samples calcined at 750 89 800 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm1) Fig. 11.

In Spectra A and B the intensity of the 816 cm\"1 peak decreased in magnitude relative to the intensity of the 782 cm\"1 peak when the calcination temperature was raised from 500 to 750 C. Spectra C and D show that there was no change in the Raman spectrum when the calcination temperature of that sample was increased. Finally in Spectra E and F the intensity of the 816 cm~1 peak increased in magnitude relative to the 782 cm -1 peak when the calcination temperature was increased. Changes in the relative magnitudes of the 816 cm~1 peak and the 782 cm~1 peak indicate that changes are occurring in the Mo/Fe ratio of the sample. The samples which were calcined at 750 C for 2 h were covered with metallic-looking crystal hairs. The crucibles in which samples were calcined at 750 C were found to have long, flat metallic-looking crystals on their sides and lids after the calcination. These phenomena were never observed for samples calcined at 500 C or less. This visual evidence indicates that metal or metal oxide crystals segregated from the bulk iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts which were calcined at 750 C. The molybdenum to iron 90 ratios of these samples, as measured by ICP-AES, were significantly different than those of samples of the same precursor which were calcined at a lower temperature. Iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts are to a large extent Fe2(MoC>4)3. Ferric molybdate melts at 956 C [46], well above the 760 C calcination temperature. Iron oxides have an even higher melting temperature. However, molybdenum trioxide melts at 795 C [47] which is relatively close to the 750 C calcination temperature. If molybdenum had been lost from all of the samples calcined at 750 C, then one might argue that this was due to a greater volatility of MoOs. However, for some samples the iron content rather than the molybdenum content was reduced. Table 3 lists the Mo/Fe ratios for samples calcined at 750 and at 500 C. Table 3 also includes a description of the expected change in the Mo/ Fe ratio as indicated by changes in the Raman spectra of the samples. Three of the eight samples had a marked decrease in Mo/Fe ratio at the higher calcination temperature. Four samples increased in Mo/Fe ratio and one sample did not change. In general the directions of the changes in the Mo/Fe ratio indicated by the Raman spectra were in agreement with the results of the ICP-AES measurements. However, there were two cases where discrepancies existed. Spectra D and E in Fig. 6 are virtually identical and thus indicate that there was no change in the Mo/Fe ratio. ICP-AES measurements showed that the atomic Mo/Fe ratio decreased from ~ 1.8 to ~ 1.5 at the higher calcination temperature. For the sample with a Mo/Fe ratio of 2.6, spectra recorded after calcination for 1 h at 500 C and after calcination for 2 h at 750 C indicated that the Mo/Fe ratio of that sample increased with calcination at 750 C. However, ICP AES measurements indicated no significant change in the Mo/Fe ratio. For the remainder of the precursor samples, the changes in the Mo/Fe ratio brought about by calcination at 750 C were accurately reflected in changes in the Raman spectra. TABLE 3 Mo/Fe atomic ratios of catalysts calcined at 750 C compared to Mo/Fe atomic ratios of catalysts calcined at 500 C Mo/Fe Mo/Fe Change in Change in Mo/Fe Figure calcined calcined Mo/Fe indicated by reference at 500 C at 750 C Raman spectra 1.5 1.7 increase increase 9 1.8 1.5 decrease no change 6 2.0 2.3 increase increase - 2.0 2.4 increase increase - 2.4 2.6 increase increase 8 2.6 2.6 no change increase - 2.7 1.9 decrease decrease - 3.0 1.8 decrease decrease 7 91 The expected result of the high temperature calcination of the catalyst precursors was that all of the precursors would lose molybdenum. Other researchers [21,48 ] have reported a loss of molybdenum in catalysts subjected to high temperatures. In a study on the deactivation of Fe Mo 0 catalysts under industrial conditions Burriesci et al. [49] found that there was a loss of molybdenum from the hot spot in the packed bed reactor. Presumably the loss of molybdenum is due to sublimation of MoOs. The loss of iron rather than molybdenum from some of the samples used in this study was an unexpected result. Preparation of catalyst by heating mechanical mixtures of the constituent oxides Ferric molybdate [FeaCMot^s] can also be prepared by heating a mechanical mixture of molybdenum trioxide [MoOa] and iron oxide [FegOa] in air with intermittent grinding [ 7 ]. The Raman spectra in Fig. 12 demonstrate that this solid state reaction does indeed occur. However, temperatures in excess of 500 C are required for the reaction to proceed at an appreciable rate. 1200 800 400 0 RAMAN SHIFT (cm') Fig. 12. Genesis of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst by heating a mixture of MoC>3 and Fe2C>3. Nominal composition: atomic ratio Mo/Fe= 1.7. Sample (A) MoOg+FezO^ mixture heated at 300 C for 5 days; (B) sample (A) heated at 500 C an additional 2 days; (C) sample (B) heated at 700 C an additional 2 days. 92 Powders of the two oxides were mixed in the proportion needed to produce a molybdenum to iron atomic ratio of 1.7. The mixture was heated to 300 C for 5 days. The spectrum of this material (see Fig. 12) is identical to the spectrum of the mixture before it was heated. Spectrum A is characteristic of molybdenum trioxide. Molybdenum trioxide is a strong Raman scatterer, while iron oxide is a very weak Raman scatterer. Therefore a spectrum which is characteristic of molybdenum trioxide is expected from a physical mixture of iron oxide and molybdenum trioxide. After Spectrum A was collected, the sample was returned to the oven and the temperature of the sample was raised to 500 C. Spectrum B was collected after the mixture had been held at 500 C for 2 days. This spectrum is still predominantly that of molybdenum trioxide. However, there is a new peak beginning to appear at 782 cm\"1 which is characteristic of ferric molybdate. The oxide mixture was then returned to the oven and the temperature raised to 700 C. After 2 days at 700 C the sample was removed from the oven and Spectrum C of Fig. 12 was collected. This spectrum is characteristic of an iron/molybdenum oxide catalyst with a Mo/Fe ratio of 1.7. This experiment verified that it is indeed possible to prepare iron/ molybdenum oxide catalysts by heating mixtures of the pure constituent oxides. However, the resulting material has significantly lower specific surface area than catalysts prepared by coprecipitation of iron and molybdenum from solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. Conclusions The Raman spectra of all bulk Fe Mo 0 catalysts displayed bands characteristic of FeaCMoO^s. Spectra of those catalysts which contained molybdenum in excess of that needed to form stoichiometric FeaCMoO^s also displayed bands characteristic of MoOa. The relative intensities of these MoOa peaks increased as the amount of 'excess' molybdenum increased. The ratio of the intensity of the MoC>3 peak at 992 cm\"1 to the intensity of the Fea(Mo04)a peak at 966 cm~1 provided a rough measure of the ratio of molybdenum to iron in the bulk catalyst. Raman spectra were collected at intermediate points in the catalyst preparation protocol. Spectra were collected in situ as the precipitate that results from mixing solutions of ammonium molybdate and ferric nitrate was heated in air. No changes in the Raman spectrum of the catalyst precursor were detected until a temperature of 105 C was reached and the catalyst precursor began to be transformed into FeaCMoO^s. At a temperature of 120 C a solid phase reaction slowly occurred in which FeaCMoO^ was formed. Raman spectra collected before and after calcination of other samples indicated that at elevated temperature the same reaction occurs at a higher rate. Despite differences in the physical appearance of catalyst precursors dried at temperatures ranging from 20 to 85 C, the Raman spectra of these 93 precursors were identical. The Raman spectra of the final catalysts resulting from these preparations were also identical. Hence the conditions under which the precursors are dried have no effect on the finished catalyst. The effect of the calcination time on the finished catalysts was investigated by treating samples of catalyst precursors in a calcining oven for lengths of time varying from 1 to 64 h. Except for the shortest times (< 3 h) at the lowest calcination temperature (110 C), the Raman spectra of the finished catalysts were not altered by varying the calcination time. Bulk catalyst precursors were calcined at temperatures ranging from 125 to 750 C. The Raman spectra of samples calcined at 125 C displayed bands associated with Feg(Mo04)3, but did not contain any MoOa bands regardless of the Mo/Fe ratio of the sample. A calcination temperature of 125 C is sufficient to effect a solid phase reaction leading to formation of FcaCMoO^a, but this temperature is not sufficiently high to bring about the formation of a MoOs phase. An increase in the calcination temperature from 125 to 250 C caused the appearance of MoOa peaks in the Raman spectra of the catalysts. A further increase in the calcination temperature from 250 to 350 C caused a further increase in the relative intensities of the MoOa peaks. The magnitude of the latter increases for different samples, indicating that a precursor which was evaporated to dryness can be fully calcined at a lower temperature than can a precursor which was obtained by filtration.

Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize unsupported iron/molybdenum oxide catalysts of the type used for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Bulk catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation from solutions of ferric nitrate and ammonium molybdate. The Raman spectra of the catalysts contained bands characteristic of Fe2(MoO4)3 and MoO3. For unsupported catalysts with Mo/Fe ratios greater than 1.5, the relative intensities of the MoO3 and Fe2(MoO4)3 peaks in the Raman spectra were approximately proportional to the corresponding atomic ratio. These catalysts are comprised of Fe2(MoO4)3 and MoO3 which are formed in the calcination step of the preparation protocol. Raman spectra indicate that a solid phase reaction begins as the precipitates are heated at 105 °C. At 125 °C Raman bands characteristic of Fe2(MoO4)a were observed. At 250 °C bands corresponding to MoO3 appeared. In situ and ex situ spectroscopic studies were used to obtain further information about the influence of variations in the preparation protocol on the properties of the final catalysts.
