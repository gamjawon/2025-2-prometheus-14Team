Graphical abstract Carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts are very promising application in ammonia synthesis. Here we show that the oxygen functional groups can be introduced into carbon preloaded with Ru species by HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment. The results reveal that the presence of oxygen functional groups facilitates the desorption of hydrogen species. Moreover, the decomposition of barium nitrate is accelerated, and the ill effects of carbon methanation and hydrogen poisoning are effectively alleviated. The combination of the change in the existing form of Ba promoter, the acceleration in the desorption and exchange of hydrogen species accounts for the superior ammonia synthesis activity of Ru catalyst with HNO3 gas-phase treatment. Understanding the role of oxygen functional groups provides design rules for the rational design of carbon-supported Ru catalyst with highly activity and stability for ammonia synthesis or other hydrogen-involved reactions. Keywords Ammonia synthesis Carbon-supported Ru catalyst HNO3 gas phase treatment Hydrogen adsorption Oxygen groups 1 Introduction Ammonia is an important raw material in chemical industry and expected to play a key role in renewable energy as energy carrier or carbon-free energies [1–7]. The potential applications in energy filed would lead to the sustained increaseddemand for ammonia in the further. Modern industrial ammonia synthesis is based on the Haber-Bosch process using iron catalysts operated at elevated pressure (around 200 bar) and temperature (500 °C) [8], which consumes 1–2% of the world’s energy each year and emits more than 1% of the global anthropogenic CO2 [9–11]. The replacement of Fe catalyst with Ru catalyst has recently attracted significant attention, which allows catalytic conversion of N2 to ammonia at lower pressure and temperature (around 100 bar and 350–450 °C) [12,13]. At the end of last century, high surface area graphite supported Ru catalyst with alkali promoter has been successfully used in ammonia plant, which is proposed to be the most important advancement following the original work of Haber and Bosch [12]. Unfortunately, the wide application of graphite-supported Ru catalysts in industrial ammonia synthesis is limited owing to their deactivation problem. Previously, the methanation of carbon support, which would be boosted by Ru species [14,15], is suggested to be responsible for the deactivation of carbon-supported Ru catalysts [16,17]. The oxygen-containing surface groups have been found to be more easily gasified to from CH4 [18,19], and thus a heat treatment at high temperature (above 1500 °C) in an inert atmosphere was usually carried out to remove these oxygen-containing surface groups before the addition of Ru species [12,19]. However, the formation of methane can be effectively inhibited by these methods, but the stability of carbon-supported Ru catalysts is still far below the requirement for the industrial ammonia synthesis. Zhou et al. found that carbon methanation has a negligible influence on the stability of Ru/C catalysts [20]. Lin et al. proposed that carbon oxidation to carbon monoxide was always accompanied by a great decline in activity for K-promoted Ru catalysts [21,22]. They confirmed that Ru/C catalysts without alkali promoter showed excellent stability, and no loss in activity was observed after a heat treatment at 500 °C [23,24]. In this case, the effect of surface oxygen groups on the deactivation of Ru/C catalysts without alkali promoter can be negligible, and then the ammonia synthesis activity of Ru catalyst should be tuned by the introduction of oxygen containing surface groups into carbon support. The introduction of oxygen groups into carbon support is a highly efficient method for enhancing the performance for various catalytic reactions. For ammonia synthesis, the influence of the oxygen surface groups on the activity for carbon-supported Ru catalyst is usually attributed to the enhancement of the Ru metal dispersion [23,25,26]. However, the oxygen containing surface groups also might affect the catalytic activity of carbon-supported metal catalysts by changing the adsorption of the organic reactants. For example, Toebes et al. found that the removal of the oxygen groups from Pt/CNF catalysts was beneficial for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation by assisting the cinnamaldehyde adsorption on carbon support [27]. Wan et al. showed that carbonyl/quinone and phenol functional groups in carbon nanotube (CNT) facilitated adsorption of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural for CNT-supported AuPd nanoparticles, leading to enhancement of the rate of the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation [28]. Kerdi et al. found that oxygen-containing groups affected the competitive adsorption between substrate molecules and water, leading to the changing in the activity of carbon-supported Ru catalysts in HMF oxidation [29]. Gosselink found that the introduction of oxygen functional groups changed the adsorption mode of fatty acids for Pd/CNF catalysts, leading to an increase in the activity of the deoxygenation of fatty acids [30]. Donoeva et al. reported that carbon-supported gold catalysts with more surface groups showed higher reaction rates of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation because there was a higher local concentration and adsorption of hydroxyls [31]. Several steps, such as the dissociation of H2 and N2, the reaction of H and N atoms, the desorption of nitrogen hydrogen products, are involved in ammonia synthesis reaction [32]. N2 dissociation is the rate-determining step of ammonia synthesis [13,32,33], however, the hydrogen adsorption would precede the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen for Ru catalysts [34–37], and thus the activities of Ru catalysts are strongly inhibited by hydrogen poisoning effect [38–40]. As a consequence, it can be imagined that the ammonia synthesis activities of Ru catalysts would be significantly enhanced by an appropriate tuning of hydrogen adsorption. In the present work, a HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment is carried out to introduce oxygen groups into carbon-supported Ru catalyst. The result shows that the introduction of oxygen functional groups strongly affect the adsorption–desorption properties of hydrogen species and the decomposition of barium nitrate for carbon-supported Ru catalyst with Ba promoter, leading to significant enhancement of ammonia synthesis activities. In the meantime, the ill effects of methane formation and hydrogen poisoning could be effectively alleviated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Commercial carbon (956 m2 g−1, Fujian Xinsen Carbon. Co., Ltd.) was thermally treated at 1970 °C for 5 h in nitrogen to obtained the thermally modified carbon (210 m2 g−1). Subsequently, the thermally modified carbon was oxidized in steam at 440 °C for 20 h, and then treated in Ar at 900 °C for 12 h to remove surface oxygen groups. The resulting carbon was named as AC, and the surface area of AC was 626 m2 g−1. Ruthenium was deposited on AC (32–60 mesh) by incipient wetness impregnation with ruthenium(III) nitrosyl nitrate solution (1.5% w/v, Aldrich) to obtained Ru/AC, and the weight ratio of Ru to carbon was fixed at 5 wt%. After reduction in H2 at 450 °C for 4 h, a portion of Ru/AC was impregnated with Ba(NO3)2 solution. The as-prepared sample was dried at 90 °C for 0.5 h and then labelled as Ba-Ru/AC, the weight ratio of Ba to carbon was about 6 wt%. The other portion of Ru/AC was treated in a steam atmosphere of concentrated nitric acid at 125 °C for 3 h to obtain a sample (Ru/AC)O. During the treatment, the concentrated HNO3 was heated to 100 °C in a three necked flask, and nitrogen gas (15 mL min−1) was introduced to make sure that nitric acid gas passed the sample. Finally, Ba(NO3)2 was introduced, and the catalyst was named as Ba-(Ru/AC)O. The weight ratio of Ba to carbon was 6 wt% for all catalysts, the obtained catalysts without any further treatment were denoted as the “as-prepared samples”, the as-prepared samples were reduced in hydrogen at 500 °C for 6 h to obtain “the fresh catalysts”. After a long period of more than 100 h activity test, the obtained catalysts were named as “the used catalysts”. 2.2 Catalyst characterization N2 physisorption isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 at liquid nitrogen temperature after degassing the samples at 200 °C for more than 6 h in an N2 flow. Surface areas were obtained by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation, and the pore size distribution was calculated by BJH method based on N2 desorption branch of isotherms. Pore volumes were calculated based on the value at a P/P0 of 0.99. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a pretreatment chamber (Highlight Tech Corp.). The samples were prereduced at 500 °C for 6 h in 10 vol% H2/Ar in the pretreatment chamber, and then moved into analysis chamber without exposure to air. Boehm titration was used to determine the concentrations of basic/acidic sites [41]. The fresh samples were suspended in aqueous solutions of HCl, NaHCO3, Na2CO3 and NaOH (0.01 mol L−1, 25 mL) with vigorous stirring. The number of basic sites was obtained by the amount of HCl consumption, and the overall quantity of the acidic sites (phenolic, lactonic, and carboxylic groups) was estimated by the amount of consumed NaOH. The content of phenolic groups was calculated by the difference between NaOH and Na2CO3 consumption, the amount of lactonic or lactol groups was determined bythe difference in NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 consumption, and the number of carboxylic groups was quantifiedby the consumption of NaHCO3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM-2010 microscope. Raman spectra were collected by a InVia Reflex Raman microscope. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was carried out on a PANalytical X’Pert3 diffractometer. Temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. Typically, 0.1 g of the as-prepared catalyst was reduced in 10 vol% H2 in Ar (50 mL min−1) from 50 to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, and the signals were collected by a Hiden HPR-20 mass spectrometry. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) and D/H exchange reaction were performed on the same apparatus. Before TPD measurements, the sample was reduced in hydrogen at 500 °C for 6 h. After purging with Ar, the sample adsorbed H2 at 400 °C for 1 h, and subsequently cooled down to 50 °C in H2 flow. Finally, the sample was heated to 600 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1. For the TPSR study, the reduced sample was purged in Ar and cooled down to room temperature, Subsequently, the catalyst was heated in 3.3 %N2-10 %H2-Ar mixture from 50 to 900 °C, and the mass signals of methane were recorded. For the D/H exchange reaction, after purging with Ar at 400 °C, the reduced sample adsorbed D2 for 1 h, and then cooled down to 50 °C in D2. Finally, the 3.3 %N2-10 %H2-Ar mixture was introduced into the catalyst preadsorbed with D2, and the mass signals were obtained. 2.3 Ammonia synthesis measurement A stainless steel reactor with inner diameter of 12 mm was used for catalyst evaluations. Before measurements, 0.2 g catalysts (32–60 mesh, diluted with quartz sand) were treated in a stoichiometric N2-H2 mixture (1:3 N2/H2) at 500 °C for 6 h at 0.2 MPa. After maintaining under the selected condition (400 °C, 25 vol% N2 + 75 vol% H2, 120 mL min−1, 1–10 MPa) for more than 4 h, the ammonia concentrations in the effluent were measured by a Thermo Scientific ion chromatography (ICS-600), and then the rates were calculated. The mass and heat transfer calculations showed no external and internal diffusion limitations under the selected conditions [42,43]. 3 Results 3.1 Catalytic performance The ammonia synthesis rates of Ru catalysts as a function of time are displayed in Fig. 1 . The initial activity of Ba-Ru/AC was ca. 26.8 mmol gcat −1 h−1, and the value of Ba-(Ru/AC)O was about 38.0 mmol gcat −1 h−1, indicating that HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment leads to enhancement of the catalytic activity by more than 40% for carbon-supported Ru catalyst. The ammonia synthesis activities increase slightly without degradation in activity for a long period of more than 100 h, revealing that Ba-promoted Ru catalysts both exhibit the stable catalytic activity, which is in line with previous studies of Lin et al. [23,37]. The increase of reaction pressure results in increased activity of Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalysts, and the rate ratios of Ba-(Ru/AC)O to Ba-Ru/AC also increase with the increase in reaction pressure from 1 to 10 MPa. These results indicate that hydrogen poisoning effect is weaker for Ba-(Ru/AC)O than that for Ba-Ru/AC [38,44,45], which is important for the industrial application of ammonia synthesis. 3.2 Characterization of oxygen-containing groups The surface area and pore volume of AC is 626 m2 g−1 and 0.59 cm3 g−1, and the values are 215 m2 g−1 and 0.24 cm3 g−1 for the fresh Ba-Ru/AC. This result reveals that the presence of Ru species and Ba leads to lowering of the surface area for Ru catalyst, which might be due to the pore blockage by the presence of Ru or Ba species (Fig. S1). However, the surface area and pore volume would partially recover for Ba-(Ru/AC)O, indicating that the gas-phase oxidation treatment of Ru catalyst would lead to the creation of some pores. The surface areas are 238 and 534 m2 g−1 for the used Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, which are slight higher than the values of the corresponding fresh samples. The slight increase in the surface area between the fresh and the used samples might be due to the removal of a little unstable oxygen groups. Some oxygen species might exist in the samples in the form of barium oxide or ruthenium oxide during the calcination of Ru catalysts. However, the theoretical loadings of Ru and Ba promoter are identical between Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, and the differences in the actual Ru loading are also slight among the fresh and the used samples. As a result, it can be concluded that the increase of the O/C ratio from 0.040 to 0.075 for the fresh Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O directly correlates with the enhancement of oxygen-containing groups as a result of gas-phase oxidation treatment (Table 1 ), which agrees with previous works on carbon nanofibers supported Pd catalysts by Gosselink et al. [30,46]. The results of Boehm titration show that the numbers of acidic sites and basic sites all increase significantly for the sample with HNO3 treatment (Fig. S2), further confirming that gas-phase oxidation treatment results in enhancement of oxygen-containing groups. The influence of gas-phase oxidation treatment on the number of oxygen-containing groups also can be confirmed by XPS study. It is well known that various carbon components can be distinguished in the C 1s spectrum of the oxygen-containing carbon: sp2-hybridized carbon (284.5–284.6 eV), alpha carbon (α-C, 285.1–285.3 eV), carbon bound to oxygen with a single bond (CO, 286.1–286.3 eV), carbonyl groups (CO, 287.4–287.7 eV), carboxylic groups (OCO, 288.7–290.0 eV), carbonate (290.8–291.0 eV) and shakeup satellites of carbon (π → π*, 290.5 and 292 eV) [31,47]. The sp2-hybridized carbon is dominant among the functional groups for AC (Fig. S3), the CO (ethers and phenols), CO (quinones and ketones) and OCO (carboxyls, lactones, and esters) bonds also can be observed. The introduction of Ru and Ba species into the as-prepared catalysts leads to appearance of a new C 1s peak at 285.1–285.3 eV, corresponding to alpha carbon (α-C). The hydrogen reduction of Ru catalysts leads to notable enhancement of the intensity of C 1s peaks at above 290 eV, indicating that these peaks should be attributed not only to the shakeup satellites of carbon, but also to the XPS peaks of BaCO3 (vide infra). HNO3 treatment results in enhancement of the relative concentrations of CO and OCO groups for the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalyst (Fig. 2 and Table S1). As a consequence, it can be concluded that gas-phase oxidation treatment of HNO3 leads to partial conversion of the CO into OCO groups for carbon-supported Ru catalysts, which is in line with the result over Pd catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers [31]. The shoulder peak at around 1610 cm−1 (D′ band) is observed in the Raman spectra of carbon and Ru catalysts (Fig. S4), revealing that the disordered carbon existed on all samples [48–50]. A shift of the G peak from 1577 to 1569 cm−1 is found between AC and the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O, further confirming that Ba and Ru species are closely associated with the carbon support, leading to the appearance of alpha carbon (α-C) for Ru catalysts [49]. In the meantime, the increase of the ratio of D band and G band (I D/I G) further confirms that the amounts of carbon defects of the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O are larger than those of the fresh Ba-Ru/AC. As shown in Fig. S3, there is only a Ru 3d5/2 peak at 283.2 eV in the as-prepared samples, indicating that Ru species mainly exists in the form of RuO3 in the as-prepared Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O without treatment [37,51]. After hydrogen reduction, two new Ru 3d5/2 peaks at ca. 280.2 and 281.1 eV would be found in the Ru 3d region of the fresh Ru catalysts (Fig. 2), which correspond to Ru0 and Ru4+, respectively [37,51], revealing that some Ru oxides still exist in the fresh Ru catalysts with hydrogen treatment. No change in the Ru 3d5/2 binding peaks is observed between the fresh Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, indicating the introduction oxygen groups slightly affects the electronic property of Ru species. Moreover, the Ru0/(Ru0 + Run+) ratios are 0.554 and 0.536 for the fresh Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, respectively, and the values are 0.557 and 0.538 for the used Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, respectively. There results indicate that the reduction degree of Ru species would not change greatly during the activation and ammonia synthesis measurementg for carbon-supported Ru catalysts. However, the presence of a larger number of oxygen functional groups leads to enhancement of carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide released from Ba-(Ru/AC)O in comparison to Ba-Ru/AC during H2-TPR study of the as-prepared catalysts (Fig. S6). The produced CO or CO2 species might dissociate on Ru sites, resulting in the residual oxygen and carbon species [52]. In such a case, RuO2 layersmight form, and some Ru species would be covered by the deposited carbon [37,53] As a result, HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment leads to the decrease of the Ru0/(Ru0 + Run+) ratio, and the Ru 3d to C 1s intensity ratio (IRu 3d/IC 1s) also decreases from 0.160 to 0.112. The IRu 3d/IC 1s ratios are 0.169 and 0.122, for the used Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, respectively, further revealing that the long term ammonia synthesis test or the increase of reaction pressure would not significantly affect the reduction degree of Ru species for carbon-supported Ru catalysts. 3.3 Structure characterization The TEM images and corresponding Ru particle size distributions of the fresh Ru catalysts are given in Fig. 3 . The average sizes of Ru particles are 3.4 and 2.3 nm for Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, respectively. The decrease in the size of Ru particles for Ba-(Ru/AC)O might be due to the coverage of Ru particles by the deposited carbon. It has been reported that CO or CO2 species could dissociate on Ru sites, resulting in the formation of carbon species remained on the surface of Ru species [52]. In such a case, some Ru species would be covered by the deposited carbon [37,53] As shown in Fig. S6, a larger amount of carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide are released during the reduction process of Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalyst. In the meantime, the IRu 3d/IC 1s ratio of Ba-(Ru/AC)O is lower than that of Ba-Ru/AC. As a result, the average Ru particle size of Ba-(Ru/AC)O is smaller than that of Ba-Ru/AC. As shown in Fig. 4 , there are no diffraction lines corresponding to Ru or Ru oxide phase in XRD patterns of Ru catalysts, revealing that Ru species is well dispersed on carbon surface. The signals of barium nitrate are clearly observed in the XRD pattern of the as-prepared Ru catalyst. However, the strong diffraction lines of barium carbonate are found in the XRD pattern of the fresh Ba-Ru/AC catalyst, which is in consistent with previous result [37,54,55], that is, barium nitrate could convert into barium metal or barium oxide following the barium carbonate formation pathway. However, the signals of barium carbonate still can be observed in the used Ba-Ru/AC, indicating that the full conversion of barium carbonate is not achieved for the used Ba-Ru/AC catalyst after more than 100 h activity test. On the other hand, only weak signals of barium carbonate are found in the XRD pattern of the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalyst, and no distinct diffraction lines of barium carbonate would be found in the used Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalyst. The presence of a smaller amount of barium carbonate in Ba-(Ru/AC)O, revealing that the decomposition of barium nitrate is easier for the sample with HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment. 3.4 Adsorption property As shown in Fig. 5 , two hydrogen desorption peaks can be found in the H2-TPD profiles of Ru catalysts: desorbing below 200 °C and desorbing afterwards (above 200 °C). There is a larger amount of H2 released below 200 °C from the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O than that from the fresh Ba-Ru/AC. Moreover, the high-temperature hydrogen species begins to desorb at 242 °C for the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O, which is much lower than the onset desorption temperature (365 °C) for the fresh Ba-Ru/AC. In the meantime, the maximum desorption peaks of hydrogen species occur at 523 and 482 °C for the fresh Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O, respectively. These results suggest that the HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment facilitates the desorption of hydrogen species, which can be related to a larger number of oxygen groups [21,23]. The easier desorption of hydrogen species might be conducive to the exchange between the hydrogen species adsorbed on Ru catalyst with the gas phase H2. Therefore, a D/H exchange reaction was carried out to further study the adsorption property of Ru catalysts, that is, the 3.3 % N2-10% H2-Ar mixture was used to exchange with the preadsorbed D species on Ru catalysts. The weak mass signals and the slight difference in the evolution profiles of HDO and D2O reveals that only a small amount of deuterium species on carbon would desorb in the pathway of deuterium containing water (HDO or D2O) at low temperature (Fig. S7). However, as shown in Fig. 6 , a larger amount of HD and D2 releases from the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O than those from the fresh Ba-Ru/AC when the N2-H2-Ar mixture is introduced, further suggesting that the preadsorbed D species is more easily exchanged and desorbed for Ru catalyst with HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment. The easier desorption of hydrogen species would shorten the retention time of hydrogen species on carbon surface, and then the formation of methane would be suppressed. As a result, a smaller amount of methane is detected for the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O in comparison with the fresh Ba-Ru/AC during TPSR study (Fig. S8), moreover, the onset temperature of methane formation of the fresh Ba-(Ru/AC)O is much higher than that of the fresh Ba-Ru/AC. 4 Discussion A key finding of this work is that HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment of Ru/C catalyst before the addition of Ba promoter leads to a significant enhancement of ammonia synthesis activity. Gas-phase oxidation has been found to be an effective strategy to introduce oxygen containing functional groups into carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibers [30,46,56]. Similarly, a large amount of oxygen groups has been successfully introduced on carbon-supported Ru catalyst (Figs. S3 and 2). Some unstable functional groups decompose into CO, CO2, CH4 or other carbonaceous gas with the rise of temperature during hydrogen reduction of Ru catalyst (Fig. S6). It has been found that CO formation is unavoidable for Ba-promoted Ru/C catalysts with heat treatment in N2-H2 mixture at 500 °C, contributing to the improvement of the ammonia synthesis activities for Ru catalysts with Ba promoter [21,23]. In the meantime, heat treatment in CO also greatly improved the ammonia synthesis performances of Ru catalysts [37,40]. It therefore can hypothesize that the presence of CO during hydrogen reduction is responsible for the activity enhancement of Ru/C catalysts with Ba promoter. Parastaev et al. found that CO or CO2 species could dissociate on Co sites over Co/CeO2 catalyst, resulting in the residual oxygen and carbon species [52]. Miller and Crozier proposed that RuO2 layerswould form over supported Ru catalyst during CO oxidation [53]. Under the same effect of the enriched CO species originated from the decompose of oxygen functional groups, some Ru species might be covered by the deposited carbon, and RuO2 layerswould form, as evidenced by the decrease in the IRu 3d/IC 1s ratio and the Ru0/(Ru0 + Run+) ratio. On the other hand, theoretical studies confirmed that B5 sites, which are active sites of Ru catalysts [57–59], showed maximum probability when Ru particle sizes are in range of 1.8–2.5 nm [59,60]. However, previous experimental results have indicated that the ammonia synthesis activities would not decrease with the increase of Ru particle sizes from 1.5 to 10.0 nm for Ru/C catalysts [61–63]. As a consequence, other factors, rather than the change in Ru particle sizes, might be responsible for the activity difference between Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O. First, there is a difference in the working states of barium promoter between Ba-Ru/AC and Ba-(Ru/AC)O. The working states of barium promoter in carbon-supported Ru catalyst during ammonia synthesis are found to be Ba0, BaO or Ba(OH)2 [54,64]. However, barium nitrate, which is used as the Ba precursor, would decompose into the intermediate BaCO3 phase for Ru/C catalysts with Ba promoter under the condition of ammonia synthesis [37,54,55]. It has been found that the presence of Ru metal and reducing medium would promote the formation of BaCO3 and the subsequent decomposition of BaCO3 phase into BaO or other Ba species [55]. In this work, barium carbonate could be detected in the sample without HNO3 treatment after more than 100 h activity test (Fig. 4), indicating that the full conversion of barium carbonate is difficult for Ba-Ru/AC. On the contrary, the decomposition of barium carbonate into active state of Ba promoter is easier for the catalyst with HNO3 treatment, which might be due to the presence of a larger amount of hydrogen species for Ru catalyst with HNO3 treatment. The presence of a larger amount of active state of Ba species is beneficial to the reaction of ammonia synthesis, and thus the catalyst with HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment shows higher catalytic activity. A second possible reason for enhancing the activity of Ba-(Ru/AC)O compared with Ba-Ru/AC is the difference in the adsorption property of hydrogen species. There is a competition between hydrogen adsorption and nitrogen adsorption, which strongly affects the ammonia synthesis rates [13,24,36,45,65,66]. For the sample with few surface oxygen groups (Fig. 7 a), the dissociation of hydrogen and nitrogen all take place on the Ru particles. The slow desorption of hydrogen species would populate the Ru sites, leading to the inhibition of nitrogen dissociation and ammonia synthesis, and thus the hydrogen poisoning effect is strong for Ba-Ru/AC. On the other hand, hydrogen and nitrogen molecules could rapidly activate on the sample with abundant surface oxygen groups (Fig. 7b). However, these oxygen functional groups or other detects would function as transfer agents in hydrogen migration from Ru particles to carbon support [67,68]. The migration of H atoms would be stored on the hydroxyl and epoxide groups in the form OH groups [68], resulting in enhanced hydrogen uptake. The hydrogen species on Ru catalysts might desorb in the form of water or H2 molecule [24,45,68], and it is obvious that the formation of water would be inhibited at high temperature for all Ru catalysts (Fig. S7). In present work, a larger amount of hydrogen species adsorbed in the vicinity of the Ru particles might rapidly and easily react with hydrogen or nitrogen atoms adsorbed on Ru metal, leading to the facilitation of hydrogen desorption and the increase in ammonia synthesis. As a result, it can be concluded that a larger number of oxygen groups on carbon materials might enhance the catalytic activities by changing the adsorption property of hydrogen (Figs. 1, 5 and 6). On the other hand, the facilitation of hydrogen desorption would lead to the shorter retention time of hydrogen species, then the dissociative adsorption of nitrogen molecule would not be severely inhibited, and thus the hydrogen poisoning effect is weaker (Fig. 1). The quick exchange of the adsorbed hydrogen species with the gaseous hydrogen species demonstrates that the hydrogen species migration and the ammonia synthesis could be accelerated for the Ba-(Ru/AC)O catalyst. It should be noted that the presence of a larger amount of oxygen groups on carbon support usually promoted carbon methanation for Ru/C catalysts [19,23]. However, herein carbon-supported Ru catalyst with HNO3 gas-phase treatment shows good methane resistance (Fig. S8). This difference in resistance to methanation might correlate with the location of oxygenated species with respect to Ru particles. For Ru catalyst with few oxygen functional groups (Fig. 7a), hydrogen species adsorbed on Ru particles would directly react with carbon support to form methane. On the contrary, oxygen functional groups, which are introduced into the catalysts preloaded with Ru species by HNO3 gas-phase treatment, are mainly in the vicinity of Ru particles for the sample obtained by HNO3 gas-phase treatment (Fig. 7b). The direct contact between hydrogen atoms adsorbed on Ru particles and carbon support would be hindered by the surface oxygen groups. As a result, hydrogen atoms on Ru particles might preferentially desorb in the form of H2 molecule, rather than react with carbon to form methane. In short, the timely desorption of hydrogen species would lessen the formation of methane for the sample enriched with oxygen functional groups, which is important for the stability of Ru catalysts supported on carbon used in ammonia synthesis. 5 Conclusions A large number of oxygen groups are introduced into carbon preloaded with Ru species by HNO3 gas phase oxidation treatment. The decomposition of some unstable oxygen functional groups leads to the formation of CO, CO2 and CH4, which would further affect the proportion of Ru oxide, the amount of the exposed Ru species and the size of Ru particles. The presence of oxygen groups and the change in the property of Ru species facilitate the desorption of hydrogen species, which is highly beneficial for the decomposition of barium nitrate, the alleviation of hydrogen poisoning and the inhibition of methane formation. The combination of the change in the existing form of Ba promoter, the improvement in the desorption and exchange of hydrogen species accounts for the superior ammonia synthesis activity of Ru catalysts with HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment. Taking into consideration good methane resistance and the excellent catalytic performance, it is obvious that the catalyst with abundant oxygen groups is a promising sample for industrial applications in ammonia synthesis. These findings are expected to provide design rules for the development of carbon-supported Ru catalysts that are highly active and stable in ammonia synthesis or other hydrogen-involved reactions.

        "dc:description": "Carbon-supported ruthenium catalysts are very promising application in ammonia synthesis. Here we show that the oxygen functional groups can be introduced into carbon preloaded with Ru species by HNO3 gas-phase oxidation treatment. The results reveal that the presence of oxygen functional groups facilitates the desorption of hydrogen species. Moreover, the decomposition of barium nitrate is accelerated, and the ill effects of carbon methanation and hydrogen poisoning are effectively alleviated. The combination of the change in the existing form of Ba promoter, the acceleration in the desorption and exchange of hydrogen species accounts for the superior ammonia synthesis activity of Ru catalyst with HNO3 gas-phase treatment. Understanding the role of oxygen functional groups provides design rules for the rational design of carbon-supported Ru catalyst with highly activity and stability for ammonia synthesis or other hydrogen-involved reactions.",
