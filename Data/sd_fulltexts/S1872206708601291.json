DOI: 10.1016/S1872-2067(08)60129-1 Catalytic Performance of Re/Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 Catalyst for n-Hexane Isomerization CHEN Chao, QIN Lizhen, CHEN Xiaorong, CHEN Changlin * State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China Abstract: A series of Re/Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. The crystalline structure, redox, and acid site distribution of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction of H 2 , and tempera- ture-programmed desorption of NH 3 . Their catalytic performance for n-hexane isomerization was studied. The results showed that the ad- dition of Re greatly affected the redox properties and the acid site distribution of the catalysts. Owing to the presence of Re, n-hexane isomerization was catalyzed by metal and acid sites, and thus the conversion of n-hexane and the selectivity for 2,2-dimethylbutane were significantly increased. Under the conditions of 195 o C, 1.0 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h 1 , and n(H 2 )/n(C 6 ) = 2.0, the conversion of n-hexane over 1.0%Re/1.0%Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 is 84.8%, and the selectivities for 2,2-dimethylbutane, i-hexane, and cracking products (C 5- ) are 20%, 97.7%, and 2.1%, respectively. The catalyst is stable during 150 h operation. Key words: rhenium; gallium oxide; tungsten oxide; zirconia; n-hexane; isomerization Under the pressure of more severe environmental legisla- tion, the specifications for gasoline fuels impose strong re- strictions on sulfur and aromatic compounds. In this context, the isomerization of linear paraffins (C 5 –C 6 ) plays an important role because the di-branched isomers obtained allow the maintenance of an adequate octane number. This reaction is generally carried out over bifunctional catalysts containing small metal particles such as Pt or Pd dispersed on an acidic support. The most common catalysts are Pt supported on chlorinated alumina and Pt or Pd supported on zeolite [1]. The former catalyst allows operation at low temperature (<180 o C), which thermodynamically favors the formation of high-oc- tane branched paraffins, but it is sensitive to moisture and sulfur impurities and requires chlorine treatment during op- eration to avoid activity loss, which results in serious envi- ronmental problems. Pt or Pd supported on mordenite re- quires higher operating temperature (~250 o C), at which thermodynamic constraints give lower yields of branched isomers. Therefore, there is a need for environmentally friendly catalysts that can isomerize light paraffins at low temperature. Solid acid catalysts consisting of metal oxides are becoming the most promising alternatives. It has been found that catalysts consisting of Pt supported on tungstated zirconia (WO 3 /ZrO 2 ) are active in the isomerization of light n-alkanes at moderated temperature [2–5]. However, the improvements of their catalytic activity in the isomerization of alkanes are highly desired. It has been reported that the activity of WO 3 /ZrO 2 can be increased by the addition of cer- tain promoters such as Fe [6–8], Al [9–11,3–17], Ga [12–14,17], and Zn [18]. Among the promoters studied, Ga is the most efficient one. According to the bifunctional mecha- nism, n-alkenes resulting from the dehydrogenation of n-alkanes on metallic sites can undergo skeletal isomerization on acid sites, the resulting products being subsequently hy- drogenated on other metallic sites. Pt and Pd are the typical active metal component in bifunctional n-alkane isomerization catalysts for producing high-octane gasoline. Re is cheaper than Pt and Pd and is an interesting alternative to Pt. Continu- ing our research on Ga-promoted tungstated zirconia [12–14], we investigated the effect of Re promotion on redox and acidic properties of Ga-promoted tungstated zirconia and the catalytic activity for n-hexane isomerization. CHEN Chao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 859–863 1 Experimental 1.2 Catalyst preparation Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 samples were prepared by the re- flux-impregnation method described in our previous papers [12–14]. The Zr(OH) 4 powder was impregnated with a pre-calculated amount of mixed solution of (NH 4 ) 2 WO 4 (99.999%, Acros Organics) and Ga(NO 3 ) 3 prepared by dis- solving Ga (99.999%, Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) into HNO 3 . The mixtures were refluxed at 80 o C for 18 h, dried at 110 o C, and calcined at 800 o C in static air for 3 h to obtained Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalysts denoted xGWZ, where x% is the Ga content in the catalysts. For comparison, a WO 3 /ZrO 2 (WZ) sample was prepared in a similar way. The W content in each catalyst was 15.0%. Re was loaded onto calcined WZ and GWZ by incipient wetness impregnation using an aqueous solution of NH 4 ReO 4 (99%, Zhu Zhou Jinlai Co. Ltd.). The loaded Re samples were dried at 110 o C for 24 h and then calcined at 450 o C for 3 h to obtain yRe/xGWZ catalysts, where x% and y% are the Ga and Re contents in the catalyst, respectively. 1.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument with Cu K . radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2 scan range of 10 o –70 o . Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were performed using a TP-5000-II instrument (Tianjin Xianquan, China) equipped with a thermal conductivity de- tector (TCD). The samples (50 mg) were housed in a quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in flowing air (50 ml/min) at 450 o C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in flowing N 2 , the samples were heated up to 850 o C at a rate of 10 o C/min in a gas stream of 10% H 2 in N 2 . The temperature-programmed de- sorption of ammonina (NH 3 -TPD-MS) was carried out using a BEL CAT-A instrument. A 200 mg sample was pretreated in flowing air (50 ml/min) at 450 o C for 1 h, reduced in flowing H 2 (30 ml/min) at 250 o C for 1 h, and then cooled to 100 o C in flowing He (30 ml/min). After saturating in an NH 3 stream (30 ml/min) for 30 min, the sample was flushed with He. NH 3 -TPD profiles were obtained from 120 to 700 o C at a heating rate of 10 o C/min. The desorption process was monitored by a mass spectrometer (Balzers MID). The m/z = 16 was followed to obtain TPD profiles of NH 3 because the mass intensity was relatively strong and the interference from H 2 O was negligible. 1.3 Catalytic tests Isomerization of n-hexane was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed stainless steel microreactor. A 2.0 ml catalyst sample sieved to 20–40 mesh was charged for each test. Prior to the catalytic measurements, the sample was pretreated in flowing dry air (55 ml/min) at 450 o C for 3 h. Then the sample was cooled to 250 o C and reduced in flowing H 2 (60 ml/min) for 1 h at 1.0 MPa. After reduction, the system was cooled to the reaction temperature of 195 o C. Liquid n-hexane was pumped into a vaporization area and mixed with H 2 flow. The mixture was fed into the reactor. The reaction parameters are as follows: 1.0 MPa, volume hourly space velocity (VHSV) = 1.0 h –1 , and n(H 2 )/n(C 6 ) = 2.0. The products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (SP-6800A, Shandong Ruihong Instrument Co. Ltd ) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a capillary column (SE-30, 50 m u 0.32 mm). 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Characterization of the catalysts Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of GWZ samples with varying Ga contents. After calcination at 800 o C, the WZ sam- ple contained predominantly the t-ZrO 2 phase with a minute amount of m-ZrO 2 phase. The crystalline structure of the GWZ samples was predominantly the t-ZrO 2 phase. The m-ZrO 2 phase in GWZ samples decreased with increasing Ga content. This indicates that Ga can stabilize the t-ZrO 2 phase. This may be associated with the incorporation of Ga 3+ cations into the ZrO 2 lattice. The peak intensity representing the monoclinic crystalline WO 3 (2 T = 23–25 o ) was also decreased with in- creasing Ga content, indicating that Ga can enhance the dis- persion of WO 3 on the ZrO 2 surface. TPR was done in order to determine the differences in the reducibility of the catalysts impregnated with different Re loadings. The TPR profiles of 1.0GWZ, 0.1Re/1.0GWZ, 0.5Re/1.0GWZ, and 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. It is seen that 1.0GWZ exhibits a peak at 300–400 o C, a W W MM M T T 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Tetragonal ZrO 2 Monoclinic ZrO 2 (4) (3) (2) Intensity 2 T /( o ) (1) Monoclinic WO 3 Fig. 1.

CHEN Chao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 859–863 shoulder peak at 600–700 o C, and another uncompleted peak under the experimental conditions. These reduction peaks in the H 2 -TPR profile probably correspond to the reduction of tungsten oxides of varying oxidation states [19], WO 3 :WO 2.9 (at 300–400 o C), WO 2.9 :WO 2 (at 600–700 o C), WO 2 :W 0 (at higher than 700 o C). With respect to Re/1.0GWZ, an early reduction peak is found at 210 o C, which is assigned to the reduction of Re oxide species. NH 3 -TPD-MS profiles of the 1.0GWZ, 0.5Re/1.0GWZ, and 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Peak intensity varies substantially with different Re contents. In all cases two peaks were observed, whose maximum temperatures were nearly 200 and 300 o C. These two peaks correspond to the desorption of NH 3 from weak and strong acid sites, respec- tively. The amount of NH 3 desorbed and the desorption tem- perature were considered a measure of total acidity and acid strength of the catalysts, respectively. It is observed from Fig. 3 that on Re-containing catalysts the amount of NH 3 adsorbed at lower temperature (weak acidity) was greater than that at higher temperature (strong acidity). Furthermore, an increase in Re loading led to a decrease in the total acidity of Re/1.0GWZ. The decrease in acidity of Re/1.0GWZ with higher Re contents can be accounted for by the occupation of some acid sites by Re. 2.2 Catalytic activity of the catalysts The effect of Re content on n-hexane isomerization per- formance was studied under the conditions of 195 o C, 1.0 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h 1 , and n(H 2 )/n(C 6 ) = 2.0. The results are shown in Fig. 4. On the Re-free 1.0GWZ catalyst, the selectivity for i-hexane can reach 95%, while the conversion of n-hexane is 44%, and the selectivity for 2,2-DMB is about 3%. After addi- tion of Re to 1.0GWZ, the n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selectivity are increased dramatically. When Re content is up to 1.0% on 1.0GWZ, n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selec- tivity are 84.6% and 20%, respectively. Further increasing the Re content in the 1.0GWZ catalyst led to a slight decrease in n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selectivity. The initial increase in n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selectivity with increased Re addition is due to the availability of more metallic sites in the vicinity of acid sites enabling rapid hydrogenation and desorption of the carbenium ions. Increasing Re addition may increase the active metallic sites, that is, the metallic site/acid site ratio may reach the optimum value for isomeri- zation reaction. The maximum activity and 2,2-DMB selectiv- ity observed on 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalyst may be due to the better metal-acid site balance. The effect of Ga content on the activity of 1.0Re/GWZ in n-hexane isomerization was studied. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Over the 1.0Re/WZ catalyst the selectivity for i-hexane reaches 98%, the conversion of n-hexane is 67.7%, and the selectivity for 2,2-DMB is about 6%. After addition of Ga into 1.0Re/WZ, the n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selectivity are increased dramatically. When Ga addition is increased to 1.0% in 1.0Re/GWZ, n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB se- lectivity are 84% and 20%, respectively.

Reaction conditions: 195 o C, 1.0 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h –1 , n(H 2 )/n(C 6 ) = 2, time on stream 300 min. CHEN Chao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 859–863 Ga content in 1.0Re/GWZ catalyst led to a slight decrease in n-hexane conversion and 2,2-DMB selectivity. The product distributions in the n-hexane isomerization over different catalysts are shown in Table 1 as a function of time on stream. It can be seen that the main products are 2-methyl- pentane (2-MP) and 3-methylpentane (3-MP). The di-branched isomer of 2,2-dimethylbutane (2,2-DMB), which leads to higher octane number, is produced in lower amounts over the Ga-free 1.0Re/WZ and Re-free 1.0GWZ catalysts. The amount of 2,2-DMB increased dramatically on Ga- and Re-containing catalysts. The maximum amount of 2,2-DMB was observed over 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalyst. The amount of 2,3-dimethyl- butane (2,3-DMB) showed little changes because of the ther- modynamic distribution limitations in the range of 100–500 o C [20]. The effects of reduction temperature on the performance of the 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalyst were examined. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the performance changed with the reduction temperature, especially selectivity for 2,2-DMB and cracking products (C 1 –C 5 ). When the catalyst was reduced at 250 o C (Fig. 6(a)), the conversion of n-hexane is 85%, the selectivity for 2,2-DMB reaches about 20%, and the selectivity for cracking products is about 2.1%. When the catalyst was reduced at 350 o C (Fig. 6(b)), the conversion of n-hexane is 82%, the selectivity for 2,2-DMB reaches about 11.6%, and the selectivity for cracking products is about 3.8%. To check the recyclability of the catalyst after reduction at 350 o C for 5 h, the catalyst was regenerated at 450 o C in air for 3 h and reduced at 250 o C for 1 h. It has been found that the con- version and selectivity could be completely recovered (Fig. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 C onver s ion or selecti vit y ( % ) Ga content (%) (1) (2) (3) (4) Fig. 5.

CHEN Chao et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2009, 30(9): 859–863 6(c)). The conversion of n-hexane is 84.5%, the selectivity for 2,2-DMB reaches about 20.5%, and the selectivity for cracking products is about 2.1%. The stability of 1.0Re/1.0GWZ was examined under the conditions of 195 o C, 1.0 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h 1 , and n(H 2 )/ n(C 6 ) = 2.0. After 1 h on stream, the conversion of n-hexane is 85%, the selectivity for i-hexane reaches 97.3%, the selectivity for 2,2-DMB reaches about 20%, and the selectivity for cracking products is about 2.7%. After the 150 h stability test, the conversion of n-hexane is 84.5%, the selectivity for i-hexane reaches 97.4%, the selectivity for 2,2-DMB is about 18.9%, and the selectivity for cracking products is about 2.6%. These results clearly demonstrated that 1.0Re/1.0GWZ has a stable catalytic performance for n-hexane isomerization. 3 Conclusions Re and Ga were simultaneously added to WO 3 /ZrO 2 cata- lysts. The addition of Re has an influence on the redox prop- erties of Ga 2 O 3 /WO 3 /ZrO 2 . Some of the acid sites are occupied by Re, and the addition of Re has a great influence on the acid strength distribution of the catalyst. The n-hexane isomeriza- tion is catalyzed by metal and acid sites. The conversion of n-hexane and the selectivity for 2,2-dimethylbutane are sig- nificantly increased. Among the catalysts studied, 1.0Re/ 1.0GWZ catalyst showed the maximum enhanced activity and di-branched isomer 2,2-DMB selectivity in n-hexane isom- erization. The 1.0Re/1.0GWZ catalyst can be reused, and no considerable decrease in conversion and selectivity was de- tected after 150 h operation. References 1 Cleveland M J, Gosling C D, Utley J, Elstein J.

RESEARCH PAPER Catalytic Performance of Re/Ga2O3/WO3/ZrO2 Catalyst for n-Hexane Isomerization Chao CHEN Lizhen QIN Xiaorong CHEN Changlin CHEN * State Key Laboratory of Materials-Oriented Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China * Corresponding author. Tel: +86-25-83172257 A series of Re/Ga2O3/WO3/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. The crystalline structure, redox, and acid site distribution of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3. Their catalytic performance for n-hexane isomerization was studied. The results showed that the addition of Re greatly affected the redox properties and the acid site distribution of the catalysts. Owing to the presence of Re, n-hexane isomerization was catalyzed by metal and acid sites, and thus the conversion of n-hexane and the selectivity for 2,2-dimethylbutane were significantly increased. Under the conditions of 195 °C, 1.0 MPa, LHSV = 1.0 h−1, and n(H2)/n(C6) = 2.0, the conversion of n-hexane over 1.0%Re/1.0%Ga2O3/WO3/ZrO2 is 84.8%, and the selectivities for 2,2-dimethylbutane, i-hexane, and cracking products (C5-) are 20%, 97.7%, and 2.1%, respectively. The catalyst is stable during 150 h operation. Key words rhenium gallium oxide tungsten oxide zirconia n-hexane isomerization References 1 Cleveland M J, Gosling C D, Utley J, Elstein J.
