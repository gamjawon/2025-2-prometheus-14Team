Box 124, S-221 00 Lund(Sweden) Summary Literature data for the activation energy of the electrochemical reduc- tion of oxygen are discussed in relation to a previously suggested effect, viz., the stepwise change of E^ in heterogeneous catalysis. The electrodes are of noble metals and it is shown that the increment of the activation energy between the various catalysts has a magnitude that closely corresponds to the 0 0 stretching vibration of an 0; molecule adsorbed on these metals, especially on platinum. This leads to a simple model for the 'four-electron' transfer in the electrochemical reduction of oxygen. Introduction The kinetics of the electrochemical reduction of oxygen have been studied intensely during the last decades [1-4] because of the importance of the oxygen electrode in fuel cells and air-metal batteries [5]. 02 + 4H4- + 4e- = 2H2O The composite nature of this four-electron reaction necessitates the use of catalysts of some kind to achieve a reasonable rate of reaction, or in other words, to achieve a reasonable value of the exchange current density, i'o. One of the most commonly used catalysts is platinum, followed by other precious metals or alloys of them [6]. The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the characterisation of the processes that take place at the surface of the noble metal catalysts. It is well known [4] that the electrochemical reduction of oxygen can proceed along two different routes: One is a two-electron path and gives rise to hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate. The other one is a four-electron path, resulting in a complete reduction of 0; to H^O without this interme- diate. The term 'four-electron path' does not imply that the four electrons are transferred simultaneously, but that the 0 0 bond is broken at a rela- tively early stage of the reaction. In this way the appearance of hydrogen peroxide is avoided. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 72 In order to understand the details of the reaction, it is important to know at which stage of reduction the splitting of the dioxygen bond takes place. It is the proposition of this paper that an analysis of the activation energy of the process can be used to make such a decision. The activation energy is connected with the temperature dependence of i'o, the exchange current density, i'o is related to the measured current den- sity by the Butler-Volmer equation. For a single-electron step transfer reac- tion it holds; cf., e.g., Bockris and Reddy [7], pp. 1007, 910; i = i'o{exp((l - ss)Fr)/RT} - exp(-ssFT?/.RT)} (l) For a multistep electron transfer reaction as the Oz reduction, 1 ss in eqn. (1) is replaced by the anodic transfer coefficient t< (cf. [7], p. 1007) and ss by the cathodic analogue, a: i = io{exp('aFrf/RT) --exp)-SF'nlRT)} (2) i'o can be estimated from a Tafel extrapolation in a current region where one of the terms above dominates: In |i| = In io+0:1''IT? | ART (3) For a single step, i'o can be written as: io = Ftc exp(-ssFA(f>JRT) (4) where k is the rate constant of the rate-determining step of the reaction occurring at zero electric field, A0e i8 the equilibrium potential difference across the electrode interface [7] and c is the concentration in the bulk solu- tion. Analogously, for a multistep transfer reaction: i'o = Ftc exp(-aFA0e/-RT) (5) For the case under consideration, the 0; reduction, it has been shown by Clouser et al. [8] that o' is almost proportional to the absolute temperature (cf. Fig. 6 of [4]), i.e. 0; bT. An explanation of this observation has been suggested by Ulstrup [9]. Whatever the cause, it is obvious that eqn. (5) simplifies to: i-o = Ftc exp(-&-FA0e/.K) (6) The temperature variation of i'o is therefore, neglecting the variation of A0e, related solely to that of the rate constant d In io/ dT = d In kj dr = EJRT2 (7) where E a is the activation energy. Consequently, in order to determine Eg. one has to determine i'o at sev- eral different temperatures. Such measurements have been reported by Appleby and coworkers in a series of papers [10 -14] for the O; reduction on noble metals in 85% ti^PO^. These data are reproduced here in Table 1 exactly as they appear in the original papers. 73 TABLE 1 Activation energies for oxygen reduction at zero overpotential according to Appleby [10-14] l kcal =4.184 kJ Metal Ref. a (kcal mol\"1) Difference (kcal mol-1) Au Ir Rh Ft Ru Pt/8%Ru Pt/18%Ru Pt/40%Ru Pt/60%Ru Pt(oxidized) 10 10 11 12 11 13 13 13 13 14 23.6 12.6 22.0 22.9 11.7 17.0 15.5 18.2 13.6 13.1 + 0.8 1.0 1.5 0.9 0.50.6 11.0 9.4 0.9 11.2 5.3 1.5 0.3 1.6 0.5 10.5 The stepwise change of 3 Before treating the data of Appleby, one might focus attention on the typically stepwise variation of the energy of activation often found for het- erogeneously catalysed reactions. It seems to appear for one and the same system (or very similar systems) under slightly different conditions. This effect has been noted before [15,16]. Here only one example will be quoted from the last-mentioned paper [16] to illustrate the following way of reason- ing. This example is that of nitrogen hydrogenation, using the data of Nielsen [17] and Ozaki [18] for various ruthenium catalysts. Table 2. It is obvious that the data fall into three groups, with JE'a = 27.3, 22.1 and 17.0 kcal mol\"1. One might further note that the differences between the group- values are certain multiples of a common factor, call it E-y. In the present example E^ = 5.15 kcal mol-1. The interpretation of this observation pro- posed in our previous paper [16] takes the following steps: 1. The energy of activation is the energy that the reacting molecule has in excess of the non-reacting ones. 2. This energy must be acquired m quanta of that vibration mode that most closely resembles the distortion of the reacting molecule when it approaches the 'activated state'. 3. Hence the activation energy is as high as, or somewhat higher than, the energy barrier that must be surpassed (Fig. 1). In this context it may be reasonable to point out that we are not direct- ly concerned with the prehistory of the reacting molecule, i.e., the influence of adsorption or other pre-equilibria. We will discuss only the differences between energies of activation of a series of very similar systems. The origin of the slight dissimilarity between the systems can be a difference in lattice parameters of the surface, the presence or non-presence of neighbouring 74 TABLE 2 Ruthenium catalysts for dinitrogen hydrogenation; all energy values in kcal mol\"1 Source Catalyst jBa Source Catalyst ^ Fig. 20 of [17]Fig. 21 of [17]Mean value of .Eg 27.3(11) 17.0(6) 22.1(7) N-l N-2 N-3 X X;K C-l C-2 C-3 C-4 KNOs CsNOg NH4N03'cyanide'Difference 10.3 6.1 5.2 28 Table 1 28 of[18] 17 17 27 27 28 26 26 28 28 17 17 28Analysis2x5 1x5 1X5 glass SiC celite A403 AlaOa/K (0/K133 (C)/K70 (C)/K206 (C)/K690 26 23 17' 21 17 23 21 22 22 23 Mean value of the common factor; 20.6/4 = 5.15 5.15 kcal mol-1 1800 cm-1 molecules, and so on. In this interpretation we assume that the heat of adsorption is the same for N3 adsorbed on the different ruthenium surfaces. The difference between the systems is supposed to depend on the dif- ferent modes of preparation, different supports and so on. The point in Fig. 1. Schematic presentation of the activation process for the dissociation of a diatomic molecule, in this case N3. The reaction coordinate is the N N distance. The activation energy must be the number of quanta that will bring the level of excitation of the nitro- gen molecule above the crossover point. 75 question here is that -Ey should be one or possibly several quanta of the vibration mode that activates the N3 molecule, i.e., takes it to the point of rupture (vide supra). One notes that Ey is 5.15 kcal mol\"' = 1800 cm\"1. This is a very rea- sonable value for a dinitrogen molecule adsorbed on an electron-donating metal that weakens the triple bond and hence decreases the wavenumber from that of the free molecule, 2331 cm\"1. Actually, a frequency as low as 1550 cm\"1 (^N2) has been found for nitrogen on Fe(lll) in EEL spectra recorded by Tsai et al. [19]. So far, this model neglects the anharmonicity of the vibration. The oxygen electroreduction Let us now apply the same type of analysis to the data given by Appleby [10-13] and quoted in Table 1. Column 5 of Table 1 and column 2 of Table 3 contain the differences between consecutive 3 values. It appears that they can be regarded as multiples of almost 2.5 kcal mol\"1. This corre- sponds to a vibration wavenumber of about 870 cm\" t. From this first rough analysis one can proceed by asking: Which linear function a = nk + a (8) will express the actual -Eg values when the consecutive numbers, n, are cho- sen so that the slope k is close to this common factor, 2.5 kcal moF1? A regression analysis gives a = 2.49n + 0.8 (9) for the n values indicated in Fig. 2. The correlation coefficient is 0.98. This good fit indicates that the change of the activation energy of the activated TABLE 3 Analysis of the differences between activation energies quoted in Table 1.

The apparent energy of activation of the oxygen molecule [10-13] plotted against the integer, n, that most closely represents the quotient E^IEy. The line is given by eqn. (9) ( y = 2.5 kcal mol\"1). oxygen molecule does take place in a stepwise manner. It does not tell us that the numbers of n chosen are those actually needed in the excitation process. This choice will be discussed in detail below. The coefficient 2.49 kcal moF1 quite exactly corresponds to 870 cm\"1. This is a frequency that is characteristic of the peroxide group [20]. Indeed, it is known [21] that the complex (Ph3P)3PtC>2 has an 0 0 vibration fre- quency of 830 cm\"1 and the analogous Pd complex has one of 880 cm\"1. Most important in this connection. Gland et al. have recently studied oxy- gen adsorption on platinum by EELS [22]. Among the forms of oxygen adsorbed on platinum (111) surface, they found one species that has also the value 870 cm\"1. This species is regarded by the authors [22] as 'molecularly adsorbed' in contrast to the oxide-like species that give EELS signals at 760 cm\"1 and 490 cm\"1. Before we draw any conclusions from this finding, it might be wise to point out that the analysis would be perfect if we had dealt with data con- cerning only platinum, e.g. platinum on various supports, platinum exposing different crystal surfaces, variously-poisoned platinum, and so on. The data of Tables 1 and 3, however, refer to a series of different metals, M (M = Au, Ru, Ir, etc.). 0 It is not at all certain that the M\\ I vibration is the same for all of these metals. Indeed, for 0; molecularly adsorbed on Pd, an 0 0 stretching vibration of 775 cm\"1 has been reported [23], and for O; on Ag(llO) a cor- responding one at 640 cm\"1 [24]. But on the other hand, one should remember that the peroxide 0 0 stretching vibration is one that is remark- ably constant [20, 25]. One can compare 880 cm\"1 for ii^Oz, 842 cm\"1 for ifa^O^Sii^O [25]. It therefore seems likely that any minor variations will be overshadowed by the more important experimental error that is always present. Furthermore, the fact that a good correlation appears for the chosen n values indicates that the experimental errors of Appleby's data [10-13] 77 are small, and that the peroxide-like vibration modes for oxygen adsorbed on noble metals are indeed rather constant. This is not meant to state that the data of Appleby should necessarily be the true ones, but rather that any (constant) systematic error in the determination would cancel in our analysis. Discussion It is well known [26] that the apparent activation energy of a hetero- geneously catalyzed reaction can be expressed in terms of the 'true' or 'sur- face reaction' activation energy, E, by adding the enthalpy change of adsorp- tion of the relevant reagent. Hence we can write: a = E + AHads (10) and by comparing eqns. (9) and (10) we can identify the intercept 0.8 kcal mol\"1 with Affads + m 2.49, where m is the number that has to be added to the set of n numbers in Fig. 2 to get the real number of excitation levels. Hence, if e.g., m = 2, one gets A-ffads = ~4.2 kcal mol~1. It should be remarked here that the enthalpy of adsorption of oxygen on platinum in a molecular state is not very high. Gland et al. [22] quote a value of 37 kJ mol\"1 ( 9 kcal mol\"1) for the clean surface and 16 kJ mol~1 ( 4 kcal mol\"1) for a partially oxide-covered surface. The value that can be ascribed to a surface covered by water molecules is not available. The close resemblance between 2?y and the stretching vibration fre- quency of O; on Pt(lll) from Gland et al. [22] makes it very probable that the rate-determining reaction step involves the stretching of an adsorbed 0^ unit that has already gained so many electrons by transfer from the metal that it should be regarded as a peroxide entity, i.e., it has obtained the oxi- dation state 1. At the point of breaking, or slightly later, an electron is transferred to each of the oxygen atoms, resulting in an oxidation state 2. This mecha- nism is actually very much like that given by Clouser [27] and quoted by Yeager [4]. A graphical interpretation of our model is given in Fig. 3. The reaction coordinate is taken as the 0 0 distance at any moment. In the Fig- ure, we use parabolic potential curves with equally spaced energy levels. As stated above, this is a first, crude approximation. The parabola at the right represents two cases of a bending vibration mode for which the equilibrium distance has been chosen slightly different in the two cases. The vibration mode of 0 0 stretching is activated with a certain number of quanta until the molecule has attained a state where a crossover takes place to the parabola at the right. This means that the oxy- gen finds itself in a highly excited state of a M' O bending vibration in rela- tion to a neighbouring metal atom, M'. Figure 4 gives the interpretation in detail. It thus follows that if there is a slight difference in lattice parameters (giving the value of Ry = two M M distances) the point of crossover will shift. For the solid-drawn bending mode parabola, only six vibration quanta 78 2e 2e R. R o Fig. 3. Schematic presentation of the oxygen activation process. The two parabola at the right represent two different possibilities of the 0 0 distance at the splitting event. Fig. 4. Geometric requirements for the splitting reaction of the oxygen molecule, adsorbed at the atom M. M' and M\" denote different lattice positions of those metal atoms that will eventually bind the oxygen atoms. are needed; for the broken-line parabola, seven vibration quanta are needed to split the 0 0 bond. For the present proposition it is not important if the resulting state after the cleavage is regarded as a highly excited state of a M' O bending mode, or if it is regarded as a highly excited state of a M\" 0 stretching mode (cf. Fig. 4). The first alternative has been chosen here, as it provides an easy way to represent the reaction coordinate; the latter one cor- responds to the reaction scheme proposed by Clouser [27]. One can also envisage a scheme where protons from water or surface hydroxy groups pro- tonate the reduced oxygen atoms, and that this is the crossover-creating event. Figure 4 gives a summarizing description of the electron transfer in the reaction. One should also note that a variation in relative positions of the zero energy of the two vibration parabola will obviously influence the level of crossover, and hence the position of crossover. Thus small 'electronic' varia- tions between the catalysts employed (e.g. doping, poisoning, etc.) might influence the value of the energy needed to activate the reaction. It is, how- ever, probable that this effect will be smaller than that of the geometric influence, i.e., the variation of the lattice distances, as the enthalpy of adsorption will change in the same direction for the 0 0 unit and the 0~ one. Conclusion It is seen from the above discussion that the electrochemical reduction of oxygen on noble metals can be described in terms of a simple model of vibrational excitation of the surface peroxide compound formed in a first step 79 of adsorption. The variation of the activation energy experimentally found by Appleby can be understood in terms of slight variations in the lattice con- stants among the metals used. Possibly one can also trace it to somewhat dif- fering values of the adsorption enthalpies of reactant and product. One should note that the model assumes that the adsorption enthalpies of the various metals for 'molecular oxygen' are almost equal in size. This quantity is, indeed, known to be small, and the effect from the corresponding enthalpy of adsorption of the product might contribute to make the relevant enthal- pies identical within the limits of experimental error.

        "dc:description": "Literature data for the activation energy of the electrochemical reduction of oxygen are discussed in relation to a previously suggested effect, viz., the stepwise change of E a in heterogeneous catalysis. The electrodes are of noble metals and it is shown that the increment of the activation energy between the various catalysts has a magnitude that closely corresponds to the O-O stretching vibration of an O2 molecule adsorbed on these metals, especially on platinum. This leads to a simple model for the ‘four-electron’ transfer in the electrochemical reduction of oxygen.",
