Keywords NiO2 Stoichiometric oxidant Catalyst Benzyl alcohol oxidation 1 Introduction Using solid materials as catalysts is of great interest and importance in organic synthesis [1]. The obvious advantages are as follows: firstly and most important, improved separation and handling process, and secondly, the potential of creating active sites with improved catalytic performance. Employing precious metals such as ruthenium as active components, two types of solid catalysts based on the unique characteristics of inorganic matrices, i.e. Ru/CeO2/CoO(OH) [2,3] and mixed oxide Ru–Mn–Fe–Cu–O [4–6] have been successfully applied into various alcohols oxidation by our research group. Besides, recently published reports could be found about other solid catalysts using Ru-modified [7–9] or Pd-modified [10] materials for alcohol oxidation. In our endeavor to use these precious metal-modified catalysts in practical applications, the expensive cost of the precious metals is not acceptable in the industry. Although these catalysts were reported to be recoverable, the complete recovery of these precious catalysts is seldom attained since very fine particles in these catalysts make them impossible to recover completely using cost-effective, simple filtration. From this point of view, employing non-precious metals as active components might be the possible path for practical applications. Some non-precious metals, such as Ni-modified [11], V-modified [12] and Cu-modified [13] inorganic matrices were successfully applied to the oxidation of alcohols using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. In this present paper, a non-precious metal oxide, i.e. NiO2, was simply fabricated without using NaClO as an oxidant, making this preparation process rather novel, environmentally-friendly and different from the original preparation method [14,15]. It is well-known that NaClO is necessary for the preparation of NiO2, which is a strong oxidant towards organic oxidation [15]. However, in the present research this NiO2 does not need NaClO and the as-prepared NiO2 is available both as a stoichiometric oxidant and as an effective catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation. These double properties also give us the idea that the phenomenon of simultaneous stoichiometric and catalytic reactions might exist in many reactions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Novel method for preparing nano-sized NiO2 A wet chemical method was used to prepare NiO2. A typical example is as follows: a three-neck round bottle flask equipped with a thermometer and mechanical stirrer was charged with 120mL of de-ionized water, 5.60g of Na2CO3 and 7.40g of NaOH pellets. A second solution containing 18.00g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 60mL of water was prepared and added at the rate of 1mL/min to the first solution while stirring with 1400rpm. The resultant mixture was heated for 18h at 65°C. The dark slurry was filtrated, washed with deioned water, dried at 110°C for 12h, and calcined at 400°C for 3.5h, yielding 2.92g of black powder. 2.2 Preparing β-NiOOH β-NiOOH was synthesized according to the literature [16]. A solution containing 1.98g of NiSO4·6H2O and 15mL of de-ionized water was added dropwise into 480mL of NaOH with pH value 12.5 and kept at 25°C for 24h while stirring. The obtained slurry was firstly filtered, then dried for 16h at 100°C, and aged for 4h in 9M KOH at 90°C. Then, after another filtration to neutrality and after being dried for 24h at 120°C; 0.44g of pale green Ni(OH)2 was obtained. This solid Ni(OH)2 was added into 30mL of 1M NaOH solution, followed by the addition of 1.88g K2S2O8, with stirring for 24h; 0.32g dark β-NiOOH was obtained after filtration and dried at 100°C for 2h. 2.3 Stoichiometric oxidation of benzyl alcohol using NiO2 as an oxidant To a solution of 1mmol of benzyl alcohol and 0.10g of NaOH in 5mL of deioned water, 0.30g of as-prepared NiO2 was added while stirring on a magnetic stirrer, and the heterogeneous solution was allowed to react at 30°C for 3h in Ar atmosphere. Benzyl alcohol was purified before use. The solid material was filtered off and GC analysis of the acidified filtrate showed the yield with naphthalene as an internal standard. In the presence of NaOH, NiO2 presents strong oxidative performance as an oxidizing agent. The stoichiometric oxidation is expressed as follows: 2.4 Catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol using as-prepared NiO2 as a catalyst To a solution of 1mmol of benzyl alcohol in 5mL of toluene, 0.30g of as-prepared NiO2 was added while stirring on a magnetic stirrer, and the heterogeneous solution was allowed to react at 90°C for 6h in the molecular oxygen atmosphere. Benzyl alcohol was purified before use. The solid catalyst was recycled by filtration. GC analysis of the filtrate showed the yield. Naphthalene was used as an internal standard. The catalytic oxidation is expressed as follows: 2.5 Recovery and reuse of as-prepared NiO2 The spent as-prepared NiO2 was firstly washed with acetone to remove the adhering of organic compounds; followed by washing with 10% of aqueous Na2CO3 and de-ionized water. After drying at 110°C, the obtained recyclable catalyst was subjected to the oxidation of benzyl alcohol under the identical conditions. 2.6 Characterization Chemical composition was determined with a Z-5000 type atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) manufactured by Hitachi Co. (Japan), with the detection limit for Ni element less than 0.2ppm and with analytical error less than 5%. Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves were measured with STA449C Jupiter analysers (NETZSCH Gerätebau GmbH). The samples were heated under inert nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10°C/min. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 was performed in fixed-bed flow reactor. The sample was pretreated in 100% O2 flow at 120°C for 0.5h, and then it was cooled down to 50°C and exposed to nitrogen flow in order to purge the line. The TPR profile of each sample was recorded from 50 to 850°C under a flow of 5.0% H2/Ar. The flow rate of 5.0% H2/Ar was 60mL/min, and the catalyst weight was 50mg. The heating rate was 10°C/min. The consumption of H2 was monitored continuously with a TCD gas chromatograph-equipped molecular sieve 5A in order to remove H2O from the effluent gas. Powder XRD data were collected on a XD-3A difractometer (nickel-filtered Cu Kα X-radiation, λ =0.15418nm) with a curved graphite monochromator, an automatic divergence slit (irradiated length 20.00mm), a progressive receiving slit (slit height 0.05mm) and a flat plate sample holder, in a Bragg–Brentano para-focusing optics configuration. Intensity data were collected at a rate of 0.02° per step in the range 10°≤2θ ≤70° with a scan time of 0.3sstep−1. The diffractograms were compared with the JCPDS for identification purposes. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was carried out using a Philips CM300 FEGTEM microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV with the resolution of 0.2nm. The specimens were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion in ethanol, evaporating a drop of the resultant suspension onto a carbon support grid. Nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77K were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 V1.01 B automatic instrument. Pore size distribution was determined using the density-functional theory (DFT) Plus Software for data files generated from the ASAP instrument. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Determination of content of Ni After complete dissolution of the as-prepared material by aqua fortis, AAS gave the weight percentage of Ni as 64.08%. Comparing different oxides of nickel, such as NiO (78.58%), Ni2O3 (70.98%) and NiO2 (64.72%), the value of last one is closest to the detected value. Furthermore, during the preparation process, the calcination temperature of 400°C confirmed the absence of hydroxides of nickel, which is also proved by TG–DTA results in the following. As a result, the present component of this as-prepared material could only be NiO2 (64.72%) or NiOOH (64.01%). It is well known that nickel hydroxide has been extensively used as an active material of the positive electrode in rechargeable alkaline batteries [17]. The overall reaction related to the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox couple in alkaline electrolytes is as follows: Ni(OH)2 +OH− ⇔NiOOH+H2O+e− There exist two types of NiOOH: β-NiOOH, which is obtained from β-Ni(OH)2, and γ-NiOOH, which is oxidized via α-Ni(OH)2. γ-NiOOH has a higher average nickel oxidation state compared with β-NiOOH, making it less stable [18]. For the above-mentioned reason, β-NiOOH might be available with the present wet chemical method and was synthesized according to known publications for comparison. 3.2 Identification of as-prepared material by TG–DTA and TPR TG and DTA were utilized to give the differences between as-prepared material and β-NiOOH, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. TG analysis under inert atmosphere shows a weight loss of 18.26% in the range 150–500°C for β-NiOOH; however, no weight loss could be found in the range 150–500°C for as-prepared material. The further evidence could also be provided from the DTA results. Endothermic peaks at ca. 106.7 and 230.3°C are ascribed to the loss of water located on the external surface of the pore and internal molecular lattice, respectively; however, only the peak ascribed to the loss of water located on the external surface of the pore could be found, suggesting that the as-prepared material is NiO2 and that β-NiOOH should be excluded. Some further evidence to exclude β-NiOOH could be obtained from results of TPR. The characteristic temperature for H2 consumption could be given from the TPR profile, as shown in Fig. 3 . The lower temperature peak has been assigned to the decomposition of β-NiOOH into NiO with a subsequent reduction to Ni metal corresponding to the higher temperature peak, which matches the H2 consumption associated with the TPR of NiO. There exists no lower temperature peak for the as-prepared material, showing that this as-prepared material is not β-NiOOH. The fact that the H2 consumption peak of as-prepared material is larger than that of NiO also hints that this present as-prepared material is different from NiO and should be composed of more oxygen atoms. 3.3 Determination of crystal structure and size of as-prepared NiO2 by XRD and TEM The XRD patterns for the as-prepared NiO2, β-NiOOH and NiO samples are given in Fig. 4 . Obviously, NiO2 and NiO have the same crystal structure, with three peaks at ca. 37.2°, 43.2°, and 62.8°, corresponding to (200), (111), and (220) planes; the position and relative intensity of the XRD peaks for cubic NiO taken from the JCPDS standard are (200) plane (intensity: 2.09), (111) plane (intensity: 2.41), and (220) plane (intensity: 1.48), respectively. β-NiOOH has the peaks at ca. 19.0° and 38.4° and these locations are consistent with the JCPDS standard of β-NiOOH with the peaks at (001) plane (intensity: 4.83) and (100) plane (intensity: 2.41). It is instructive to note that broadening of the peak width at half height suggests fine average particle size, which is in accordance with the TEM analyses. The particle size information for as-prepared NiO2 is shown in Fig. 5 . TEM analysis has revealed evidence that as-prepared NiO2 is very fine with the mean diameter about 20nm; for the purchased NiO, elliptic particles with mean diameters about 200–400nm could be well observed. 3.4 Determination of physical properties of as-prepared NiO2 by BET The N2 adsorption isotherm gives the BET area and Langmuir area as about 150 and 210m2/g, respectively, in accordance with the common knowledge that NiO2 has a large surface area [15]. The N2 adsorption isotherm of as-prepared NiO2 exhibits a typical adsorption curve of type IV, as shown in Fig. 6 . The step can be identified in the adsorption curve at a relative pressure 0.65< P/P 0 <0.90, which is due to the characteristic of mesopores. The as-prepared NiO2 contains very little micropores, which is indicated by the t-plot and the value of correlation coefficient of about 0.99726, as shown in Fig. 7 [19]. N2 isotherm-derived volumes of mesopores and micropores are 0.3743 and 0.0226cm3/g, respectively, indicating that the contribution to pore volume for micropores is only 5.7%. 3.5 As-prepared NiO2 as a stoichiometric oxidant In comparison with the NiO2 prepared by adding NaClO solution according to Nakagawa's method [14], as-prepared NiO2 exhibits similar stoichiometric oxidative performance. When as-prepared NiO2 was used as an oxidant in the presence of Ar atmosphere at 30°C using alkaline solution as solvent towards benzyl alcohol oxidation, a yield of benzoic acid at about 98.4% was obtained for 3h, suggesting that as-prepared NiO2 is a strong oxidant. This result is very close to the value in Nakagawa's report, with the yield of benzoic acid about 96.7% under the similar reaction condition. This result further proves that the as-prepared material is NiO2; yet the preparation process is simpler and NaClO-free. 3.6 As-prepared NiO2 as a catalyst using molecular oxygen as an oxidant It is strikingly surprising that this as-prepared NiO2 could be successfully utilized as a catalyst for the first time in the same oxidation, however, in this case NiO2 acted as a catalyst using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. When benzyl alcohol was catalyzed by as-prepared NiO2 using toluene as a solvent in the presence of molecular oxygen at 90°C, NiO2 presented highly catalytic activity with the yield of benzaldehyde about 80% within 6h. This high yield even exceeded the effect catalyzed by Ni–Al hydrotalcite with 31% yield of benzaldehyde within 12h under the similar reaction condition [11]. Fig. 8 gives the benzyl alcohol oxidation performance with different catalysts. The addition of catalyst is of great importance: benzyl alcohol oxidation at 90°C gave little product without catalysts. The catalytic activity of NiO is much lower than that of NiO2, showing that the contribution of high valence of Ni in as-prepared NiO2 is much larger than that of low valence in NiO. Comparing their activities under the different oxidants, i.e. molecular oxygen and air, despite a little lower catalytic activity for those using air as an oxidant, benzyl alcohol was smoothly oxygenated, with the yield reaching 66% after 12h. We want to assert heterogeneous oxidation and no leaching of as-prepared NiO2. The evidence for no leaching could be determined by the AAS method whose detection limit is 0.2ppm. Membrane filter (0.2μm) was used to separate the solution and the catalyst, and nickel ion in the filtrate could not be detected. This NiO2 catalyst could be reused with a retention of its high catalytic activity and selectivity; the result is shown in Fig. 9 . This recyclable experiment again proves that the as-prepared NiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst instead of a stoichiometric oxidant. Furthermore, this catalyst was applicable for the oxidation of heterocyclic alcohol including nitrogen atom. 2-Pyridinemethanol was smoothly oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde with high yield, as shown in Scheme 1 . 3.7 Simultaneous existence of stoichiometric and catalytic oxidations The fact that as-prepared NiO2 acts both as a stoichiometric oxidant with the yield of benzoic acid about 98.4%, and as an effective catalyst with the yield of benzaldehyde about 80%, hints that in nature stoichiometric and catalytic reactions should simultaneously exist. In our catalytic oxidation cases, when the reaction is protected by an inert atmosphere such as Ar, 14% yield of benzaldehyde after 6h could be obtained owing to the stoichiometric oxidation, suggesting that 80% yield of benzaldehyde can be ascribed to both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Such situation easily happens in the cases using non-precious metals as active components, since these non-precious metals could not easily activate oxidants such as relative inert molecular oxygen, leading to their oxidation state valence being difficult to recycle. The phenomenon is not so obvious and is seldom perceived for the cases using precious metals such as ruthenium as active components, because relative inert molecular oxygen becomes easily activated even under mild conditions [4]. In a word, simultaneous existence of stoichiometric and catalytic oxidations is a common natural phenomenon according to our understanding. Some typical experiments related to simultaneous existence of stoichiometric and catalytic reactions are being designed and will be further investigated. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a novel, simple, and environmentally-friendly process for fabrication of NiO2 was developed, which acted as both a stoichiometric oxidant and as an effective catalyst for benzyl alcohol oxidation.
