Using transmission electron microscopy, it was confirmed that during the reduction of the catalyst in a swelling medium, migration of palladium from inside the polymer mass towards the pore walls occurs. Without redistribution, most of the palladium would be unaccessible for the hydrogenation of cyclopentene. The accessibility of palladium depends both on the pore surface area and the bulk structure of the ion-exchange resin polymer. Introduction Strongly acid ion-exchange resins containing metals from Group VIII of the Periodic Table are promising bifunctional catalysts capable of performing hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed reactions simultaneously. Their application was pioneered by Bayer A.G., Leverkusen, FRG [I], and at present at least two processes exist which use this type of catalyst on an industrial scale the synthesis of methyl isobutyl ketone and the production of t-amyi methyl ether. The properties of catalysts based on polymer carriers differ in many respects from those of their inorganic counterparts. A number of papers exist which deal with the influence of the polymer skeleton on the function of the acidic centres in ion-exchange resin catalysts (see, for example, refs. 2 to 5), but only little is known about the influence of the ion-exchange resin carrier on the role of metallic sites in bifunctional catalysts. In the present study we have tried to obtain such information by means of a separate investigation of the hydrogenation activity of a series of bifunctional catalysts as obtained by supporting palladium on strongly acid resins. Experimental Lewatit OC 1038 is a commercial ion-exchange resin catalyst containing palladium, manufactured by Bayer A. G., Leverkusen. It is a macroreticular 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 248 strongly acid type having a BET surface area of 26m2 g-1, an exchange capacity of 4.6 mmol g~1 and a palladium content of 0.3%. It is supplied in the unreduced form. Other catalysts were prepared in our laboratory by impregnation of various macroreticular ion-exchange resins with palladium. The amount of palladium acetate (purum, Fluka) corresponding to the desired palladium loading was dissolved in acetone (2 cm3 per g resin). This solution was diluted with water (1:1) and contacted with an ion-exchange resin in the H\"1' form for 4 h with occasional stirring. The ion-exchange resin was then transferred into a glass column and washed with water. The collected washing water was combined with the supernatant solution left after the impregnation and analyzed for its palladium content by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results accounted for 95 - 98% of the palladium retention on the resins. A series of differently sulphonated ion-exchange resins was prepared from macroreticular styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer 30/10 (Spolchemie, Usti nad Labern). The conditions of sulphonation and the resulting exchange capacities of the resins produced are listed in Table 1 for individual members of this series. Before the catalytic experiments, all the catalysts were dried for 12 h at 110 C and then stored over phosphorus pentoxide. The hydrogenation of cyclopentene was used as the model reaction for testing the catalytic activity. Cyclopentene was carefully fractionated under nitrogen and stored above a molecular sieve. All experiments were performed in a small magnetically stirred stainless-steel autoclave (internal volume 5 cm3), connected via a stainless-steel capillary tube to the reduction valve of a hydrogen bottle used for the regulation of the hydrogen pressure. The autoclave could be heated by immersion in a water bath. Vigorous stirring (lOOOrpm) by a magnetic stirring bar was used to eliminate any influence of external mass transfer. The catalyst, ground into a fine powder, was added a short time after the start of the reaction; hence the effect of particle size was eliminated. Experiments were conducted at 30 C and 1 MPa hydrogen pressure. The autoclave was opened after 2 h and cyclopentene conversion determined by gas chromatography at 40 C using a 5 m column packed with 10% EDO-1 (Supeico) on Chromosorb W. The palladium and sulphur concentration profiles within the polymer particles were examined by means of the JEOL JXA 50A electron microprobe.

To facilitate the measurements, an electrically conducting layer was pro- duced on the sample surface by vacuum evaporation of carbon. Transmission electron microscopy was effected by means of a JEOL 100CX instrument operating at 80 kV. Before such measurements, the ion- exchange resin catalysts were soaked for l h in a 1% solution of osmi- um(VIII) oxide in a cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0). This treatment enhanced the contrast between the ion-exchange resin mass and the epoxy resin used for sample embedding. The polymers were dehydrated by washing with methanoi, which was then gradually replaced by the Epon 812 resin. After hardening, slices of ca. 10 nm thickness were cut from the samples by means of a Reichert Cryocut microtome. Results and discussion Since the commercial ion-exchange resin Lewatit OC 1038 was supplied in an unreduced form and the catalysts prepared contained Pd11, it was necessary to investigate how the reduction method influenced the hydrogena- tion activity. In addition to a change in the oxidation state of palladium during reduction, a redistribution of palladium within the polymer skeleton can occur. Migration of various metals towards the periphery of the resin beads during preparation of metal-loaded ion-exchange resin catalysts has been reported by Hanson and coworkers [6], and a more definite proof of the possibility of palladium redistribution was obtained in a series of experiments with gel-type ion-exchange resin catalysts (crosslinked with 8% divinylben- zene) containing [Pd(NH3)4]2'1' cations [7]. Electron microprobe measure- ments of the palladium concentration profile over the cross-section of the ion-exchange resin beads containing [Pd(NH3)4]2'1\" cations have shown that palladium was distributed uniformly throughout the particles. However, after reduction induced by bubbling gaseous hydrogen through an aqueous suspen- sion of this ion-exchange resin at 60 C, all the palladium was found to be concentrated in the outer shell of the polymer beads. Evidently, when the mobility of the reducing agents in the polymer mass is lower than the mobility of the metal ions, the reduction only proceeds on the periphery of the polymer particles and metal ions diffuse from the interior towards the surface where they are reduced. The low resolution of the electron mi- croprobe (which was only ca. l fim) did not allow detection of such redistribu- tion in macroreticular ion-exchange catalysts, but its effect should be very significant in tests of the catalytic activity. In the present work, the tests of the catalytic activity were performed under identical conditions with macroreticular ion-exchange resin Lewatit OC 1038 in the original unreduced form and with samples prereduced by hydrogen, alternately in cyclopentene or water, and by aqueous 250 TABLE 2 Influence of reduction procedure on the activity of Lewatit OC 1038 in cyclopentene hydrogena- tion\" Catalyst Conversion (%) without prereduction 30.0 prereduced in cyclopentene (30 C, 1 MPa Ha, 2 h) 28.7 prereduced in water (30 C, 1 MPa Hg, 2 h) 100.0 prereduced in 40% aqueous formaldehyde (60 C, l h) 77.8 Between reduction and catalytic tests all catalysts were dried at 110 C for 12 h. Test conditions: catalyst, 0.01 g; cyclopentene, 2 cm3; 30 C; 1 MPa Ha; 2 h. formaldehyde. The samples were dried carefully between prereduction and the catalytic test. The results obtained are listed in Table 2. No difference was found between the results obtained with the catalyst tested in the unreduced form and with the catalyst subjected to preliminary reduction in cyclopentene. On that basis, one may speculate either that hydrogenation proceeds on palladium ions stabilized in cyclopentene by the formation of n -complexes with cyclopentene, or that the reduction of the accessible palladium ions is very fast and proceeds without any palladium redistribution. However, preliminary reduction in other solvents enhanced the catalytic activity considerably, suggesting that redistribution of the palladium during reduction does occur. Electron microprobe measurements of the palladium distribution within the catalyst grains employed in the experiments listed in Table 2 revealed that the distribution of palladium was homogeneous in beads of macroreticular Lewatit OC 1038 either in the unreduced or reduced form. Despite this result, it is still possible that a palladium concentration gradient could have existed within the polymer microspheres from which the beads of the macroreticular polymers are composed [8]. From the BET surface area of Lewatit OC 1038 (considering its skeletal density to be about 1.4 g cm\"3), it is possible to estimate the diameter of these microspheres as being about 160 nm. It means that they are approx- imately an order of magnitude smaller than the resolution of the electron microprobe. An irregular distribution of metallic palladium in the reduced catalysts was revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Figure 1 illustrates the electron micrograph of Lewatit OC 1038 reduced by hydrogen in an aqueous environment. Fine palladium particles are concentrated in the lighter spaces between the polymer microparticles which appear as darker spots due to osmium contrasting. This provides evidence that migration of palladium from the interior of the polymer mass towards the pore walls proceeds during reduction. In agreement with literature data [6, 9], smaller numbers of sub- stantially bigger metal particles were formed during reduction by formalde- hyde than in the case of hydrogen reduction (Fig. 2). The lower dispersion of 251 Fig. 1. Electron micrograph of Lewatit OC 1038 reduced by hydrogen in water. metallic palladium could be the reason why the activity of the catalyst reduced by formaldehyde is lower than the activity of the same sample when reduced by hydrogen. The effect of palladium distribution within the polymer matrix can be studied under controlled conditions using partially sulphonated macroreticu- lar ion-exchange resins. Sulphonation of copolymers of styrene and divinyl- benzene by sulphuric acid proceeds from the surface towards the interior of the polymer bulk. In partially sulphonated polymers, only two sharply sepa- rated domains exist the fully sulphonated surface layer and the un- sulphonated interior of the polymer bulk. This phenomenon has been used to investigate the catalytic activity of sulphonic acid groups deposited in various parts of the macroreticular polymer mass [10]. Equally, it can be employed for the controlled deposition of palladium ions. In a fully sulphonated polymer palladium is spread evenly within the polymer mass, but in partially sulphonated samples it is present only in the surface layers. The kinetics of the hydrogenation of cycloalkenes on palladium cata- lysts is known to be zero order with respect to the cycloalkene concentration [11]. Under constant hydrogen pressure, a decrease in the cyclopentene concentration does not influence the reaction rate up to conversions greater than 50%. The extent of cyclopentene conversion achieved under standard Fig. 2. Electron micrograph of Lewatit OC 1038 reduced by formaldehyde. 252 Fig. 3. Dependence of cyclopentene conversion (x) during hydrogenation on the weight of Lewatit OC 1038 (A). conditions must therefore be directly proportional to the catalyst activity (Fig. 3). Tests of the catalytic activity of palladium-containing ion-exchange resins based on the macroreticular 30/10 polymer samples were performed without previous reduction, i.e. under conditions where no redistribution of the palladium occurred. The results are listed in Table 3. As expected, the greatest activity was exhibited by catalysts based on the least sulphonated ion-exchange resin 30/10S-C whose active groups are located only in the most accessible parts of the polymer skeleton. The same loading of palladium per unit mass produces different concen- trations of palladium in zones of the ion-exchange resin beads sulphonated to various extents. For catalysts prepared from ion-exchange resins 30/10S-A and 30/10S-B, a proportionality was established between the hydrogenation activity and the palladium concentration in the sulphonated polymer mass (Fig. 4). This indicates that that part of the polymer mass capable of supplying palladium for the catalytic reaction must be the same in both TABLE 3 Cyclopentene hydrogenation activity of catalysts based on ion exchanger subjected to various degrees of sulphonation\" Catalyst Exchange capacity (mmolg\"1) Content of Pd (%) Conversion (%) 30/10S-A 30/10S-B 30/10S-C 5.03 1.60 0.124 0.30 0.60 0.27 0.56 0.28 8.8 19.2 22.5 47.7 84.5 Test conditions: catalyst, 0.01 g; cyclopentene, 2 cm3; 30 C; 1 MPa Ha; 2 h. 263 Pd/S.102 Fig. 4.

In this latter catalyst, only ca. 20% of the polymer mass is sulphonated. In other words, in the fully sulphonated ion-exchange resin 30/10S-A without redistribution, at least 80% of the palladium appears not to be accessible for cyclopentene hydrogenation. Ion-exchange resin catalysts swell only negligibly in cyclopentene. Thus, it is possible to suppose that the accessible palladium is located on the pore walls. Under such circumstances for ion-exchange resins with the same exchange capacity and palladium content, the catalytic activity for cyclopentene hydrogenation should be proportional to their specific surface areas. This comparison has been made for Lewatit OC 1038 and ion-ex- change resin 30/10S-A containing 0.3% of palladium (Table 4). The differ- ence in the specific surface areas of these materials is much greater than the difference in their catalytic activities. Evidently, in spite of the above- mentioned poor swelling in the reaction medium, the accessibility of palla- dium is influenced not only by the surface area but also by the structure of the polymer mass covering the pore walls. The thickness of the layer in which cyclopentene hydrogenation proceeds is greater in the ion-exchange TABLE 4 Comparison of the properties of Lewatit OC 1038 with catalyst 30/10S-A containing 0.3% Pd* Property Lewatit OC1038 30/10S-A BET surface area (m2 g-1) cyclopentene conversion (%) on catalyst charge: 0.01 g 0.03g 26 12.8 32.0 8.5 8.8 24.6 'Catalytic tests conditions: cyclopentene, 2cm3; 30 C; IMPaHa; 2h. 264 TABLE 5 Investigation of swollen polymer mass structure by ISEC C Volume of polymer fraction (cm3 g~1) (nm-2) Lewatit OC 1038 30/10S-A \\iuu l Lewatit OC 1038 30/10S-A 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.8 1.5 2.0 0.0 0.15 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.10 0.74 0.89 0.07 0.0 resin 30/10S-A than in the probably much more crosslinked Lewatit OC 1038. Evidence for the existence of differences in the polymer mass structure of these two ion-exchange resins can be obtained from an investigation of their polymer structures in the swollen state via inverse steric exclusion chromatography (ISEC). Using this method, it is possible to characterize the structure of the swollen polymer mass in terms of the volumes of different fractions of the polymer mass (each characterized by a different density of polymer chains) present in the investigated polymer sample [12,13]. The density of polymer chains C is expressed in units of chain length per unit of volume (nm\"2). Generally, fractions characterized by C = 0.1 - 2 nm\"2 can be expected in a swollen polymer. A value of C equal to 0.1 nm~2 corresponds to a highly swollen, nearly uncrosslinked polymer, whereas a polymer frac- tion with C equal to 2 nm\"2 has low accessibility even for very small molecules. The results of the ISEC characterization of the ion-exchange resins studied in this work are listed in Table 5. The polymer mass of Lewatit OC 1038 is composed solely of dense fractions, but in the ion-exchange resin 30/10S-A a low-density polymer mass fraction with a good ability to swell is also present. This fraction is proba- bly located on the pore walls. Hence, during cyclopentene hydrogenation using the ion-exchange resin catalyst 30/10S-A, the palladium is accessible from a greater depth of polymer mass on the pore walls than in Lewatit OC 1038. In the influence of polymer carrier structure on the accessibility of palladium, the existence of this effect partially compensates for differences in the pore surface area of these two ion-exchange resin catalysts. The effects of ion-exchange resin carriers on the accessibility of the supported palladium demonstrated in this work might also be of interest for other polymer-supported catalysts. In applications of polymers as carriers, it is necessary to take into account not only geometrical parameters such as the pore surface area but also the structure of polymer mass and the considerable influence of these factors on the accessibility of the active components. 256 Acknowledgements The author is indebted to Bayer A.
