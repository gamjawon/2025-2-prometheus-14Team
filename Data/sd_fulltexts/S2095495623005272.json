Graphical abstract A bimetallic alkoxide catalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction is synthesized via a robust method. The catalyst exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance and excellent durability. Density functional theory calculation and multiple characterizations clearly demonstrate a lattice oxygen involved reaction mechanism for the in-situ generated nickel–iron bimetal-oxyhydroxide catalyst and the synergy between nickel and iron. High efficiency, cost-effective and durable electrocatalysts are of pivotal importance in energy conversion and storage systems. The electro-oxidation of water to oxygen plays a crucial role in such energy conversion technologies. Herein, we report a robust method for the synthesis of a bimetallic alkoxide for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for alkaline electrolysis, which yields current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 215 mV in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent durability for more than 540 h operation with negligible degradation in activity. Raman spectra revealed that the catalyst underwent structure reconstruction during OER, evolving into oxyhydroxide, which was the active site proceeding OER in alkaline electrolyte. In-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption experiment combined with density functional theory calculation suggests a lattice oxygen involved electrocatalytic reaction mechanism for the in-situ generated nickel–iron bimetal-oxyhydroxide catalyst. This mechanism together with the synergy between nickel and iron are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity and durability. These findings provide promising strategies for the rational design of non-noble metal OER catalysts. Keywords Oxygen evolution reaction Nickel-iron bi-metal alkoxide Lattice oxygen-mediated reaction mechanism Alkaline electrolysis Electrocatalysts 1 Introduction Electrocatalytic oxidation of water is a crucial technology along the path to fuels synthesized in a sustainable manner, as it provides electrons to reduce water to produce hydrogen, or reduce carbon dioxide to carbon containing fuels [1–4]. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck for water splitting due to its sluggish reaction kinetics requiring a high overpotential to drive the reaction, which decrease the energy conversion efficiency [5–8]. Currently, IrO2 and RuO2 are the benchmark catalysts, owing to their high catalytic activities and relative sustained durability for OER. Nevertheless, these precious metals are costly and scarce, hindering their large-scale application for water splitting. Hence, enormous efforts have been dedicated to fabricate cost-effective and highly efficient OER catalysts on the basis of earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition-metal oxides, including 3d metal phosphate composites [9,10], oxyhydroxides [11,12], oxide perovskites [13,14], borate composites [15,16], etc. The OER performance of multi-metal oxyhydroxides based on iron and nickel is particularly promising for alkaline electrolyzer, even outperforming that of IrO2 [17–19]. To improve the activity of an electrocatalyst, there are generally two strategies: (1) increasing the intrinsic activity of each active site through tuning the electronic configuration, introducing defects, or optimizing the phase composition, etc.; (2) increasing the number of active sites of the electrocatalyst through increasing the surface area, fabricating ultrathin nanosheet, creating 3D porous structure, etc. Metal alkoxides, a class of compound where metal ions coordinate with the hydroxyl groups of alcohol molecules, have received significant attentions for electrocatalysis [20]. Specifically, solid-state metal alkoxides have been wildly employed for electrocatalysis [21,22], photocatalysis [23], lithium batteries [24], etc. Owing to their special organic and inorganic features, metal alkoxides have large degree of similarity to that of metal organic framework (MOF) but with its own unique advantages. For example, the structure of metal alkoxide is flexible that can be tuned through adjusting the alcohol structure to obtain various morphologies, including zero-dimensional (0D) nanospheres [25], 1D nanowires [26], 2D nanosheets [27], 3D nanofibers [28]. Atomic-level mixing with different metal ions could be achieved in metal alkoxides, which can preciously control the morphology with uniform dispersion of metal decorations, and tune the electronic configurations of the active sites. Besides, the organic component can be carbonated through pyrolysis, so as to improve the electroconductivity of the catalyst. The organic component could also be removed through calcination or hydrothermal method to produce hierarchical and porous structures. Additionally, hydroxyl groups, S or P elements could be introduced through reacting with metal ions in the metal alkoxides to form the active sites for electrolysis. Metal alkoxides have also been applied directly as OER catalyst due to their in-situ transformation of layered oxyhydroxides during the electrolysis process which are the active sites in alkaline electrolyzer. Moreover, the rich hierarchical structures and the abundant transition metal sites offer sufficient active sites accessible to the reactants which facilitate excellent mass transfer. Through the local atomic structure tailoring and morphology engineering, metal alkoxides are expected to achieve efficient electrocatalysis for OER [29,30]. Wang et al. synthesized NiFe-based alkoxides (FeNi-glycerolate, FeNiGly) microspheres with average size of ∼800 nm by using solvothermal method [31]. FeNiGly required 320 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density in alkaline electrolyte, approaching to the activity of RuO2. The in-situ formed Fe(Ni)OOH was reported to be responsible for the enhanced OER activity. Through adjusting the organic component of the alkoxide, Lee et al. synthesized NiFe-glycolate alkoxide nanoparticles with improved catalytic activity supported on Ketjen black through sonochemical strategy [32]. The Ni-rich alkoxide catalyst demonstrated low overpotential of 294 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 32 mV dec−1 in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The high activity and the fast reaction kinetics were ascribed to the ultrafine particle sizes (2–3 nm), the amorphous structure, the uniform Ni/Fe distribution and the synergy between Ni2+ and Fe3+. In generally, metal alkoxides functioning as OER catalysts undergo structure reconstruction from alkoxides to hydroxides or oxyhydroxides during catalytic process. Essentially, the reconstruction induces the formation of loose or amorphous structure accompanied with defects due to the decomposition of metal alkoxides, which facilitates the exposure of sufficient active sites available to the electrolyte, thus enhancing the catalytic activities, but at the penalty of stability. For example, FeOOH derived from Fe-glycolate was only tested for an operation of 24 h at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH [33]. Flower-like Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide obtained through hydrothermal treatment of Ni-glycerolate with FeSO4 survives in 0.1 M KOH for merely 11 h at 1.25 mA cm−2 [34]. Therefore, in depth investigation through advanced characterizations on the in-situ formed structures to understand the catalytic reaction mechanism of alkoxides is necessary and of crucial importance for further catalyst development with high activity and sustained durability. As OER catalyst possessing high catalytic activity, the catalyst should exhibit: (1) high surface area exposing sufficient active sites available to the electrolyte; (2) high porosity enabling an excellent mass transfer property; (3) high inherent conductivity as OER itself is an electron transfer process. In this work, we report a facile one-step synthetic strategy for the preparation of the nickel–iron-based bi-metal alkoxide possessing relative high surface area, porosity and appreciate electron conductivity. The catalytic activity of the catalyst toward OER is superior to that of benchmark IrO2, achieving relatively low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with faradaic efficiency of 99.4%. The catalyst shows no evidence of degradation in activity after continues chronopotentiometry measurements at 10, 30, 100, 200, 300, 400 mA cm−2 for a total of 540 h of operation. The real active sites and the catalytic reaction mechanism of nickel–iron bi-metallic alkoxide are systematically investigated through the combination of synchrontron X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoritical simulations. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Materials synthesis and characterization The synthesis procedure for the Ni-Fe bi-metal alkoxide (Ni-Fe-glycerolate, Ni-Fe-gly) catalyst was illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). Specifically, the Ni-Fe-gly catalyst was synthesized via an one-step solvothermal method from a mixture solution containing Ni(II), Fe(Ш) nitrates, isopropanol, glycerol and water. Fe- and Ni-gly were also synthesized as control samples. All the three samples showed the similar XRD profile (Fig. S1), where only a broad main diffraction peak at 10.5° was detected, ascribing to the interlayer spacing in lamellar structure with characteristic of metal–oxygen sheets separated by the bonded alcoholate anions [35]. The Fourier transform infrared reflection (FTIR) further revealed the formation of metal-gly. For example, except the δ(H2O) vibration at 1620 cm−1, all the bands located below 2000 cm−1 can be ascribed to metal–O, C–C, C–O, and C–H bonds (Fig. S2), evidencing the existence of glycerol moiety. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 1b) showed that Ni1Fe0.33-gly exhibited a nanosphere structure with an average particle size of 500 nm in diameter, which was different from that of yolk-shell nanosphere structure of Ni-gly and nanosheet structure of Fe-gly (Fig. S3). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images revealed a uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, and O throughout the entire the catalyst (Fig. 1f). The atomic ratio of Ni to Fe was determined to be 1:0.33 for Ni1Fe0.33-gly by EDX elemental analysis and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Fig. S4, Table S1). High-resolution TEM image further revealed that Ni1Fe0.33-gly exhibited a solid sphere nanostructure (Fig. 1c), with nanosheet distributed over the outmost of shell (Fig. 1d). HRTEM suggested that the nanosheet was a polycrystalline, as evidenced by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1e). Such a structure gives rise to a high surface area and appropriate porosity, determined by the N2 absorption measurement (Fig. S5). The Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface areas of Ni1Fe0.33-gly is 263 m2 g−1 with the average pore size of 5.011 nm, which is higher than that of commonly reported previously [36]. 2.2 Electrocatalytic OER performance We evaluated the OER performance of Ni1Fe0.33-gly in term of activity and stability in a conventional three-electrode cell containing 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, and compared to that of benchmark IrO2, control samples Ni-gly and Fe-gly. The electrode for the OER performance evaluation was prepared by uniformly depositing 199 μg cm−2 of the as-synthesized Ni1Fe0.33-gly on glassy carbon disk electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 2 a) showed that the OER activity of bi-metallic alkoxide Ni1Fe0.33-gly significantly outperformed that of the mono-metallic alkoxides Fe-gly and Ni-gly, respectively, as well as that of benchmark IrO2. The representative Ni1Fe0.33-gly required the lowest overpotential of 215 mV to achieve a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2a–c, Fig. S6). By contrast, Ni-gly, Fe-gly and commercial IrO2 required 321, 462 and 324 mV, respectively, at the same current density (Fig. 2b). Tafel plots shown in Fig. 2(c) displayed that the Ni1Fe0.33-gly exhibited the lowest Tafel slope of 43.4 mV dec−1 among Ni-gly (106.4 mV dec−1), Fe-gly (82.4 mV dec−1) and commercial IrO2 (76.5 mV dec−1), verifying the fast catalytic kinetics of Ni1Fe0.33-gly for OER. The measured Faradaic efficiency reached ∼99.4% (Fig. S7), which demonstrated the high selectivity of the catalyst for OER. The performance of Ni1Fe0.33-gly for OER in alkaline electrolysis is also superior to that of most PGM-free OER catalysts (Table S2), including metal alkoxides [37] and their derivatives, as well as the state of the art oxyhydroxides [17], which indicates that Ni1Fe0.33-gly is an outstanding OER catalyst for alkaline electrolyzer (Fig. 2g). The operating stability of the OER catalyst is essential to its application. We assessed the stability of Ni1Fe0.33-gly in alkaline electrolyte by performing chronopotentiometry test on Ni1Fe0.33-gly deposited nickel foam electrode under constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 200 h, then increased the current density to 30 mA cm−2 for 300 h, followed by continuous increasing current density to 100, 200, 300, 400 mA cm−2 for 10 h, respectively, in which the total operating life for Ni1Fe0.33-gly in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at incremental current density was 540 h (Fig. 2h). As shown in Fig. 2(h), at each constant current density, the Ni1Fe0.33-gly maintained constant overpotential with no degradation in activity within the period being detected, demonstrating the exceptional stability of Ni1Fe0.33-gly in alkaline electrolyte. To check whether metals leached into the electrolyte or not, we performed the ICP-MS measurement at selected time intervals during the stability test, and no metal dissolution was detected. To the best of our knowledge, Ni1Fe0.33-gly is one of the best performing OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte, which significantly outperforms the commercial IrO2 catalyst and could be a promising candidate for application in alkaline electrolyzer. 2.3 Structural characterizations and possible catalytic mechanism The extraordinary OER activity of Ni1Fe0.33-gly may be associated with the following aspects: (1) the intrinsic high catalytic activity of the catalyst; (2) the unique porous structure, enabling sufficient active sites assessable to the electrolyte and the excellent gas bubble dissipation; (3) the low electrical resistance of the Ni1Fe0.33-gly electrode. To determine the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni1Fe0.33-gly, we measured the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) by calculating its double-layer capacitance (C dl) through cyclic voltammetry method, as it is deemed to be proportional to the ECSA. The C dl of Ni1Fe0.33-gly was 2- and 2.6-fold higher than that of Ni-gly and Fe-gly, respectively, suggesting some contributions from the high ECSA of the Ni1Fe0.33-gly (Fig. 2d). However, there is 10- and 600-fold improvement in the current density of Ni1Fe0.33-gly at 1.5 V relative to that of Ni-gly, Fe-gly and IrO2, respectively. This result suggests that the outstanding activity of Ni1Fe0.33-gly cannot be merely attributed to its enhanced ECSA relative to each mono-metal alkoxide, but the high intrinsic catalytic activity of itself for OER in alkaline electrolyte. The intrinsic activity of Ni1Fe0.33-gly was further confirmed by calculating the turnover frequencies (TOF) at an overpotential of 300 mV. As shown in Fig. 2(f), Ni1Fe0.33-gly possessed TOF of 0.244 s−1 per total transition metal atom, assuming all the transition metal atom were electrochemically active in water oxidation, which was 6.6-, 122- and 13.6-fold enhancements in activity as compared to that of the control sample Ni-gly (0.037 s−1), Fe-gly (0.002 s−1) and the benchmark IrO2 (0.018 s−1), respectively. Such TOF of Ni1Fe0.33-gly is higher than that of many OER catalysts [3,38], including the state-of-the-art NiFeOOH [39]. Besides, we investigated the electron conductivity of Ni1Fe0.33-gly electrode by measuring the electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) in 0.1 M KOH, as it has significant impact on the electron transfer between the catalyst and the substrate which affects the overall catalytic OER activity of a given catalyst. It is worth noting that the Nyquist plot can be fitted by a semicircle with the Randle circuit model shown in the inset, which is associated with the charge transfer resistance (R ct) of the catalyst itself and the series resistance (R s) at the interface between the electrolyte and the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 2e). Indeed, Ni1Fe0.33-gly exhibited a relatively small R ct of 31 Ω compared to that of Ni-gly (62 Ω), Fe-gly (6090 Ω) and commercial IrO2 (76 Ω), suggesting an excellent charge transfer efficiency between the catalyst and the electrode disk, and also indirectly reflecting the high inherent electron conductivity of the Ni1Fe0.33-gly catalyst. To gain a deeper insight into the real catalytic active sites for the extraordinary performance, it is essential to elucidate the nano-structure, surface composition, chemical state, and local atomic structure before and after electrochemical water oxidation. HAADF-STEM and SAED revealed that the morphology and particle size were preserved, and the polycrystal structure was maintained (Fig. 3 f–g). While, EDS elemental mapping showed a uniform distribution of Ni and O, but with Fe slightly segregated to the surface. The atomic ratio of Ni to Fe was determined to be 1:0.329 by the EDS elemental analysis (Fig. S8), which was nearly consistent with the pristine state. XRD pattern of the Ni1Fe0.33-gly after 540 h operation suggested that the catalyst may undergo structure reconstruction (Fig. S9), and evolved into small particles or amorphous structure. The structure reconstruction of Ni1Fe0.33-gly after OER was further confirmed by FTIR and Raman spectra. FTIR spectra of Ni1Fe0.33-gly shown in Fig. S10 displayed that the C–H stretching vibration at 2790–2990 cm−1, as well as the C–H and C–O vibration located below 2000 cm−1 disappeared after OER testing, indicating the structure changes in Ni1Fe0.33-gly during OER electrocatalysis. The Raman peak at 525 cm−1 assigned to Ni(II)-O vibration of Ni1Fe0.33-gly [40] disappeared after OER testing. Instead, two distinctive peaks at 471 and 555 cm−1 corresponding to the Ni(III)-O bending and stretching vibrations of Ni/Fe-OOH [40] were observed (Fig. 3a), suggesting the Ni being oxidized from + 2 to + 3 and the formation of oxyhydroxide during OER electrocatalysis. In addition, the intensity ratios of the bending (I B) and stretching vibrations (I S) − I B/I S of Ni1Fe0.33-gly after OER testing was calculated to be 1.24, indicating the increased structural disorder during OER [41]. The phenomenon that the initial materials evolve into oxyhydroxides during OER in alkaline electrolyzer have been reported elsewhere [42,43]. We further performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the evaluation of the oxidation state and surface composition of Ni1Fe0.33-gly before and after OER testing. Survey spectra of Ni1Fe0.33-gly (Fig. S11) demonstrated the present of Ni, Fe on the surface. The high-resolution XPS of Ni 2p spectrum of Ni1Fe0.33-gly before OER testing corresponded to Ni 2p 3/2 and Ni 2p 1/2 with two typical peaks at binding energies of 854.6 and 871.9 eV, respectively. The satellite peaks at 860.0 and 877.8 eV indicated the existence of Ni in the + 2 oxidation state (Fig. 3b) [44,45]. Fig. 3(c) evidenced two broad peaks at 710.7 and 723.9 eV signifying Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 doublets due to the spin–orbit coupling. The satellite peaks at 716.0 and 731.1 eV are ascribed to Fe3+ [46,47]. It is worth noting that the binding energy of Ni 2p and Fe 2p XPS spectra of the fresh sample show the positive and negative shift of 0.4 and 0.2 eV as compared to Ni-gly and Fe-gly (Fig. S12), respectively, suggesting the oxidation of Ni and reduction of Fe, and electronic interaction between Ni and Fe in the Ni1Fe0.33-gly. After 540 h electrochemical OER catalysis, Ni and Fe 2p XPS spectra of the Post-Ni1Fe0.33-gly revealed that both Ni and Fe were oxidized to + 3 oxidation state. It is worth noting that, for the Post-Ni1Fe0.33-gly, the peaks at 856.4 and 873.9 eV assigned to the Ni 2p 3/2 (Ni3+) and Ni 2p 1/2 (Ni3+) [44,45] shifted by 1.8 eV toward high energy compared to the fresh sample, and the peaks at 711.0 and 724.3 eV corresponding to Fe 2p 3/2 (Fe3+) and Fe 2p 1/2 (Fe3+) [46,47] positively shifted by 0.3 eV relative to the initial state, implying that Ni was seriously oxidized toward high oxidation state and might be the active center. Based on the analysis of the Ni, Fe 2p and O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. S13), combined with FTIR and Raman results, we speculate that the final catalyst after 540 h operating in alkaline electrolysis is possibly NiFe-OOH polycrystalline but with size of sub-nanometer, which is out of XRD detection limitation (Fig. 3d–f). These results suggest that the real catalytic active sites may originate from the in-situ formed NiFe-OOH derived from Ni1Fe0.33-gly alkoxide during OER. This observation is consistent with the previous report that Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide is formed in the post-OER catalyst if nickel oxide/hydroxide has iron impurities as the starting material [19]. While, the most outstanding property of the metal alkoxides is ease of hydrolysis to produce hydroxide [33,48]. Consequently, the in-situ formed polycrystalline NiFe-OOH from Ni1Fe0.33-gly during the electrolysis might be the real catalyst proceeding the OER. To investigate the evolution of the oxidation state and the local atomic structure of Ni1Fe0.33-gly during OER, we performed the synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Ni L-edge, Fe L-edge and O K-edge of the fresh and the post-electrochemical Ni1Fe0.33-gly in the total electron yield (TEY) mode, which provided information on the near surface chemistry that below 10 nm in depth (Fig. 4 a–c). We also collected the XAS data at Ni K-edge and Fe K-edge via both transmission mode (ex-situ) and fluorescent mode (in-situ) to probe chemical changes in the bulk material. Fig. 4(a) displayed that the surface Ni of fresh Ni1Fe0.33-gly and Ni-gly were in + 2 oxidation state, and were oxidized to Ni3+ after OER testing, in line with the XPS results. XAS spectra at Fe L-edge showed that the surface Fe3+ maintained the oxidation state before and after OER (Fig. 4b). XAS spectra at O K-edge included two peaks at 533.5 and 540.5 eV, corresponding to O–metal 2p-3d hybridization and O–metal 2p-4sp hybridization, respectively (Fig. 4c). After OER testing, the intensity of O K-edge decreased obviously, indicating a decrease in the unoccupied O-Ni/Fe hybridized state [49], accompanied by an increase in the intensity at the Ni/Fe L-edge in the Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly compared to that of the fresh sample. This result suggested that the electron density increased at O site but decreased at Ni/Fe sites, and consequently a higher ionic Ni/Fe–O bonding in the Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly, leading to a weakened Ni/Fe–O bond. The absorption energy at both Ni and Fe K-edge of Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly were shifted toward high values accompanied with the enlarged white-line (WL) intensity (Fig. 4d and g), manifesting the increased average valence states of Ni and Fe after OER. In an operando XAS experiment at both Ni and Fe K-edge (Fig. 4j–k), when the applied potential was increased from 0.45 to 1.41 V (Fig. S14), the catalyst postured for the OER. When the potential was further raised to 1.55 V, the absorption energy and the WL position at Ni K-edge shifted to higher energy (Fig. 4j), suggesting the oxidation of Ni. Afterward, no matter raising the potential or reverse back to initial, the oxidation state keeps constant, suggesting that the catalytic active oxyhydroxide was formed at potential ≥ 1.41 V, and maintain the stable structure catalyzing OER for alkaline electrolysis. However, XANES spectra at Fe K-edge showed that the absorption energy changed slightly when the potential was raised from 1.41 to 1.55 V, suggesting that the main active site of the in-situ generated catalyst was Ni, and the incorporation of Fe optimized the electronic configuration of Ni toward high catalytic activity for OER in alkaline electrolysis. Meanwhile, in-situ Raman tests could directly reveal the bonding state of metal elements and probe the catalytic origin for OER. Only at a low potential of 1.45 V, the peak assigned to Ni(II)-O evolved into Ni(III)-O peak (Fig. S15), which proved that the formation energy of oxyhydroxides was lower, thus favoring their OER performances. EXAFS spectra at Ni K-edge demonstrated the successful incorporation of Fe into the Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly, where the Ni-Ni coordination intensity at around 7 Å−1 in the Ni-gly was enlarged due to the incorporation of a bigger particle Fe (Fig. 4e and f). While, compared to the Fe-Fe coordination in the Fe-gly, the Fe-Ni coordination was formed in the Ni1Fe0.33-gly and strengthened after electrochemistry, as shown in Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly (Fig. 4h and i). It is worth noting that compared to the pristine Ni1Fe0.33-gly, the k 3-weighted K-space at Ni and Fe K-edges (Fig. S16), the coordination number of Ni/Fe-O were changed in the Post-OER Ni1Fe0.33-gly (Fig. S17, Table S3), suggesting the change of the local atomic structure, the structure reconstruction, and the strengthen of the electronic interaction between Ni and Fe in the in-situ formed oxyhydroxide. Therefore, the exceptional catalytic activity of the in-situ formed NiFe-OOH derived from Ni1Fe0.33-gly might be associated with the changes in the oxidation states and local atomic structure. 2.4 DFT simulation Density functional theory was performed to study the initial high catalytic activity of the in-situ formed Fe0.25Ni0.75OOH for oxygen evolution proceeding in alkaline electrolyte. The modeling structures used for the simulation were denoted as FeNiO_HOa, FeNiO_HOb and NiO_HOc, shown in Fig. S18. As revealed by the EXAFS spectrum at O K-edge and XANES spectra at Ni and Fe K-edges, respectively, lattice oxygen likely participates the catalytic reaction and the Ni might likely be the active center rather than Fe. Therefore, our proposed 4e-mechansim of OER ocurred through lattice oxygen-mediated (LOM) pathway over the aforementioned three different active sites [50]. LOM reaction pathway was generally taken place from absorption of OH to form M−OH where M stood for the transition metal and active center, followed by deprotonation to transform into M−O. Afterward, the paths of O2 formation can be split into two different ways. One path is that M−O converts into M−OOH by merging with hydroxyl anion under one electron oxidation. Subsequently, another deprotonation coupled with one electron process proceeds, releasing O2 molecule. The second path is that two M−O sites recombine under the generation of O2 and the recovery of initial active site, which we find being energetically more favorable than either the former pathway or the conventional absorbate evolution-mediated (AEM) pathway [51]. The schematic diagram of the latter reaction pathway was depicted in Fig. 5 (a), involving four elementary steps accompanied by four electron transfers with direct *O-O* coupling occurring on the Ni sites where Fe substitution takes place nearby. As shown in the free energy diagrams (Fig. 5b, Fig. S19), the first deprotonation step was uphill and required the highest energy among all elementary steps. Therefore, it was the potential-limiting step (PLS) for all the three different structures. The results showed that the free energy required to proceed the PLS over the FeNiO_HOa site (0.58 eV) was the lowest among the other two (1.23 eV for NiO_HOc, and 0.97 eV for FeNiO_HOb). These results highlighted the important role of Fe-substitution in promotion of OER under alkaline condition. We further studied the local density of state (LDOS) of the 3d-band of Ni in the three different structures, as the improved catalytic activity might be associated with the modification of the surface electronic distribution. As shown in Fig. S20, the FeNiO and NiO were spin-polarized with distinct electron population at the spin-up and spin-down states. Obviously, there existed a downshift in d-band center from the Fermi level for Ni in FeNiO_HOa structure as compared to the other two (Fig. 5c), in favor of decreasing the absorption energy between oxygen species and Ni sites, thus high catalytic activity for OER (Fig. S21) [52]. A proportional relationship between εNi-3d and the energy barrier of the first deprotonation step was shown in Fig. S21. We also found that Fe-substitution increased the covalence of Ni–O bonds (Fig. S22 and S23), as confirmed by more electron population on the O-2p orbital of the active center near the Fermi level relative to the other two models (Fig. S24). In addition, differential charge density images (Fig. S25) showed that the *O-O* intermediate in FeNiO structure exhibited more obvious electron accumulation than that in NiO. Both of them facilitate the significantly enhanced catalytic activity of FeNiO_HOa. Therefore, the outstanding catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction of our new catalyst may associate with the direct O-O coupling reaction mechanism of LOM and the surface electronic modification. 3 Conclusions In summary, we report a facile and robust hydrothermal method to synthesize a highly active NiFe-alkoxide (Ni1Fe0.33-gly) for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. Such a Ni1Fe0.33-gly catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER activity, requiring only 215 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density in 0.1 M KOH and delivering a long-term stability for over 540 h operation at cumulative constant currents in alkaline electrolyte. Raman analysis revealed the surface reconstruction evolving into oxygen-vacancy-rich bimetallic NiFe-based oxyhydroxide during OER electrolysis, which is suggested to be the real active material by DFT simulations. In-situ and ex-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption experiments including XANES and EXAFS combined with theoretical calculations suggested that the OER proceeded via LOM, of which the O-O radical coupling was involved. Therefore, when the alkaline OER activity of oxyhydroxides needs to be improved, a rational design of the structural state, surface composition and local defects of the pre-reconstructed catalyst to necessary to inherit their excellent characteristics. This work paves a new way for the design and development of advanced catalysts for water splitting in alkaline electrolyzer through geometric structure engineering.

        "dc:description": "High efficiency, cost-effective and durable electrocatalysts are of pivotal importance in energy conversion and storage systems. The electro-oxidation of water to oxygen plays a crucial role in such energy conversion technologies. Herein, we report a robust method for the synthesis of a bimetallic alkoxide for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for alkaline electrolysis, which yields current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 215 mV in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent durability for more than 540 h operation with negligible degradation in activity. Raman spectra revealed that the catalyst underwent structure reconstruction during OER, evolving into oxyhydroxide, which was the active site proceeding OER in alkaline electrolyte. In-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption experiment combined with density functional theory calculation suggests a lattice oxygen involved electrocatalytic reaction mechanism for the in-situ generated nickel–iron bimetal-oxyhydroxide catalyst. This mechanism together with the synergy between nickel and iron are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity and durability. These findings provide promising strategies for the rational design of non-noble metal OER catalysts.",
