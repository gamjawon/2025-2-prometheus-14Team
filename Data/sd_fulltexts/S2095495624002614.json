Graphical abstract Guided by theoretical foundation and atomic structure, highly-efficient Co-N/P-C catalyst was designed and prepared for optimal oxygen reduction reaction and zinc-air batteries under alkaline condition. Atom-level modulation of the coordination environment for single-atom catalysts (SACs) is considered as an effective strategy for elevating the catalytic performance. For the MN x site, breaking the symmetrical geometry and charge distribution by introducing relatively weak electronegative atoms into the first/second shell is an efficient way, but it remains challenging for elucidating the underlying mechanism of interaction. Herein, a practical strategy was reported to rationally design single cobalt atoms coordinated with both phosphorus and nitrogen atoms in a hierarchically porous carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks. X-ray absorption spectrum reveals that atomically dispersed Co sites are coordinated with four N atoms in the first shell and varying numbers of P atoms in the second shell (denoted as Co-N/P-C). The prepared catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity as well as zinc-air battery performance. The introduction of P atoms in the Co-SACs weakens the interaction between Co and N, significantly promoting the adsorption process of *OOH, resulting in the acceleration of reaction kinetics and reduction of thermodynamic barrier, responsible for the increased intrinsic activity. Our discovery provides insights into an ultimate design of single-atom catalysts with adjustable electrocatalytic activities for efficient electrochemical energy conversion. Keywords Electrocatalytic Oxygen reduction reaction Single atom catalyst Shell coordination optimization 1 Introduction The development of fuel cells as well as metal-air batteries offers new directions for future sustainable energy applications [1–4]. Among them, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key procedure to achieve efficient energy conversion in these electrochemical devices; therefore, the improvement of the ORR performance is crucial [5–9]. Platinum-based materials are now used in ORR, but its rarity and high cost limit its widespread application [10,11]. Although those newly developed alloys [12,13], oxides [14], nitrides [15] and carbides [16] exhibit unique properties, their overall activity and durability remain far from the requirements. Therefore, designing ideal low-cost oxygen electrode materials with excellent activity and good stability under practical conditions is still imperative. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) occupy an important position in a wide range of catalytic reactions and energy application devices due to their high atom utilization and single active center [17–25]. Theoretical and practical explorations have shown that MN x single metal sites anchored on carbon substrates exhibit excellent performance and well-defined structure that can serve as satisfactory oxygen electrocatalysts [26–32]. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the optimal active site structure of the MN x system is reported as a planar four-ligand configuration of MN4, which seems to be supported by a multitude of experimental results [33–38]. However, it has also been reported that for the MN4 part, the disadvantage for the intermediate adsorption process exists during the catalytic reaction. The strong electronegativity of the symmetrical adjacent N atoms around the metal site will directly lead to an increase in the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate adsorbed on the surface of the metal active site. As a result, such a hindrance is unfavorable to the kinetic process of the catalytic reaction [39–42]. It is a rewarding job to rationally design and engineer the coordination environment of single metal MN x sites and the local structures are crucial for enhancing intrinsic activity. High-coordination shell effect is one of the important means for optimizing the performance of SACs. Specifically, the modification of the high-coordination shell can affect electronic structure and reactivity of the metal site, thereby allowing for optimal interaction with reactants and intermediates involved in the ORR process. In addition, it can also improve the stability of catalysts by preventing sintering and leaching of the active metal sites during reaction. Among the various approaches, modulating the coordination microenvironment of the metal center in MN4 with a weakly electronegative atom to improve catalytic performance is considered to be an interesting strategy [43–45]. Compared with nitrogen, phosphorus (P) in the same group V holds lower electronegativity and P modification is also commonly used to optimize catalysts by controlling the adsorption process of intermediates at the active site during the catalytic reaction as well as the modulation of SAC spin states [46–49]. However, the microenvironment and structure-activity relationships of catalysts have remained largely elusive. Therefore, the precise construction of atomic-level different microenvironments and active site provides a powerful indication for governing ORR catalytic performance. FeN4 site has become the focus of ORR research due to its excellent ORR activity and stability, but inevitable Fenton reaction and strong desorption strength with *OH have become the key factors limiting its development. In contrast, the CoN4 site is less susceptible to Fenton reaction. In addition, the interaction between Co active center and oxygen-containing intermediate species also reached a suitable degree under the support of coordination environment engineering. Herein, we developed a single cobalt atoms catalyst supported on the hierarchically porous carbon toward ORR, by introducing P atoms in the second shell adjusting the electronic configuration of active sites (denoted as Co-N/P-C). We observed the presence of N-P species in the N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum. No Co–P scattering path was found in X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum. These evidences fully validated that the introduction of P atoms was achieved in the high-coordination shell layer. During the synthesis of the catalyst, the high-coordination environment of Co-SACs can be flexibly regulated by precisely controlling the amount of PPH3 introduced, which was verified theoretically and experimentally. The engineered Co-N/P-C exhibits an onset potential of 0.971 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in alkaline media, facilitating ORR performance. Moreover, Co-N/P-C exhibits excellent stability without significant current decay under accelerated durability testing (ADT). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses together with DFT calculations proved that inducing P atoms further tuned the 3d valence electron configuration of Co centers. As a result, it enables to enhance the *OOH adsorption and achieve satisfactory ORR activity. Our work introduces in situ PPH3 as a P source into the second coordination shell of Co-SACs during the high temperature process, achieving fine-tuning of the electronic configuration of the Co center. Compared with other works, our work lies in precisely controlling the number of P atoms in the second shell through experimental and theoretical prediction methods, verifying the correlation between the number of P atoms in the second shell and ORR activity. This has significant implications for the fine-tuning of the structure of SACs. Furthermore, such strategy of atomic-level government can be extended into other metals. 2 Theoretical model and activity prediction To thoroughly explore the effect of P introduction on the catalytic mechanism, theoretical modelling as well as the corresponding DFT was conducted in order to efficiently predict catalytic source and tendency. Theoretical calculations were carried out using CoN4 as the fundamental model and different ligand-regulated P atoms as the model (labeled as CoN4P x ). Classified from the number and coordination configuration of P atoms, one P atom, two P atoms, three P atoms, and correspondingly different positions were simulated. It is worth noting that CoN4-OH is a model for axial adsorption of *OH based on CoN4. CoN4-3P-2-OH is a model for axial adsorption of *OH based on CoN4-3P-2. Various coordination configurations and the corresponding formation energies are shown in Fig. 1 (a). It can be seen that the formation energy of different configurations decreases with the increase in the number of P atoms, while the configurations in which the P atoms are directly connected in the same number of P atoms are facilitated to form. Also, the lowest formation energy coincides with the most stable conformation. By calculating formation energies, we screened out four optimal models for subsequent theoretical calculations. These four models correspond well to the catalysts in the experimental part. Inspired by the effect of self-regulated activity [50,51], the modulation of *OH coverage at the active site on the active structure of the intrinsic site was demonstrated by microkinetic simulations (Fig. 1b). For the ORR reaction, the reactants pass through the catalyst to accept electrons from the external circuit and there is *OH present in the intermediate product, which exists in balance with OH− in alkaline solution. Under saturation adsorption, it can accept electrons from the external circuit to become OH−, and concurrently the potential that can be released by *OH departure in the ORR reaction is the highest. So the step down is the largest possibly for the ORR step, and the resultant product is the state of the active site in the actual process (dashed portion). On top of active sites in the previous steady state, the ORR process was calculated and found that the rate-determining step is O2→*OOH step, and the free energy diagrams of the ORR process for different models are also given in Fig. 1(c and d). It can be observed that at an applied potential of U = 0 V, the free energy of all reaction steps is decreasing, which implies that the reaction is easy on all the four catalysts. As the content of P atoms increases, it allows the maximum potential that can be emitted by the catalyst from 0.763 to 0.824 V. When the applied potential U is 1.23 V, the pre-doping overpotential is 0.467 V and the post-doping overpotential is 0.406 V, ∼13% lower in comparison. Furthermore, we investigated the electron transfer effect on the catalytic mechanism in CoN4-3P-2. It further confirmed whether the electronic states for CoN4-3P-2 were conducive to obtaining excellent ORR activity or not. Partial density of states (PDOS) was used simultaneously to further explore the adsorption strength of intermediates on the active site. It can be seen from DOS that the incorporation of P will change the interaction between Co and N, and then affect the d-band distribution of Co (Fig. 1e–h). The addition of P results in the enhancement of the Co-N interaction and the broadening of the d-band energy expansion. The enhanced interaction between Co and N will reduce the orbital energy, which is not conducive to the adsorption of the intermediate *OOH. With the increase of P content, the conjugate structure is broken, and the excess charge of P coordination unsaturation occurs, resulting in spin asymmetry. For the CoN4 site, there are four identical nitrogen atoms around Co and the surrounding is a graphene network structure, it presents a symmetric charge distribution state. After introducing the P atom in the second shell coordination, due to the difference in electronegativity and atomic radii, it will cause a certain degree of geometric distortion of the original CoN4 planar symmetrical structure, and its charge distribution will also present an asymmetric distribution state. This indirectly optimizes the electron configuration of the Co active center. The excess charge causes the occupied states to appear closer to the Fermi energy levels. The appearance of energy levels is more favorable for *OOH adsorption, causing the strength of *OOH adsorption to increase with the addition of P. From the charge density difference in the inset that the Co-N interaction weakens with the increase of P, while rendering the charge distribution in the center of Co asymmetric, which is the key to the enhanced *OOH adsorption. The DFT calculation proves that the introduction of P optimized the Co 3d electron orbital, hence facilitating the *OOH adsorption process and accelerating the ORR process. The ORR processes on CoN4-3P-2 model possess lower theoretical overpotential and thermodynamic overpotential compared with that on the CoN4, suggesting that P-doping Co-N–C catalyst (CoN4-3P-2) is more energetically favorable for the ORR process (E f = 6.04 eV), which is in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations. 3 Materials and methods 3.1 Chemicals 2-Methylimidazole (2-MeIM), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O), cobalt(II) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)3), Pt/C (20%), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) were purchased from Aladdin. Methanol and isopropanol were purchased from Traditional Chinese Medicine without further purification. 3.2 Synthesis of catalysts 3.2.1 Preparation of ZIF-8 and Co-ZIF-8 In a typical synthesis process, cobalt (II) acetylacetonate Co(acac)3 (0.229 g, 0.9 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O (2.65 g, 9 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (100 mL) and stirred to form a homogeneous solution, which was labeled as the solution A. 2-MeIM (6 g, 73 mmol) was dissolved into methanol (100 mL) and well-mixed, which was recorded as the solution B. Solution A was poured into solution B under ultrasonic conditions. Then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The obtained Co-ZIF-8 precursor was centrifuged and washed three times with methanol, and finally dried overnight in a 60 °C vacuum drying oven. ZIF-8 is prepared under the same synthetic conditions without the addition of cobalt acetylacetonate. 3.2.2 Preparation of Co-N-C and Co-N/P-C Co-N-C was obtained by placing Co-ZIF-8 in a tube furnace after high-temperature heat treatment. The heating condition was 950 °C in Ar atmosphere for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The N/P-C samples were obtained by heat treatment of a certain proportion of ZIF-8 and PPh3 placed in two porcelain boats respectively, in which PPh3 was placed upstream of the tube furnace. The processing condition was 950 °C in Ar atmosphere for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The N-C samples were obtained from pure ZIF-8 under the heat treatment in tube furnace. The Co-N/P-C samples were obtained by heat treatment of a certain ratio of Co-ZIF-8 and PPh3 placed in two porcelain boats. 3.3 Computational details The spin-polarized DFT calculations have been conducted on Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) to study the ORR on prepared catalysts. The projector augmented wave method with a cutoff energy of 400 eV accompanied by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional has been used in the DFT calculations. DFT-D3 method was used to correct the influence of van der Waals interactions. One layer of the carbon (001) surface has been cleaved with a vacuum layer of 15 Å to build the slab models. Five C atoms have been replaced by one Co atom and four N atoms to build the Co-N-C model. The C-atoms closed to N-atoms have been replaced by P-atoms to build the P-doping models. All models have been fully relaxed with the energy convergence criterion of 10−5 eV and the force convergence criterion of 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. The Brillouin zone integration was performed with a Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of the Γ point. The adsorption energy (E ads) has been calculated using Eq. (1). (1) E a d s = E t o t a l - E s u b s t r a t e - E a d s o r b a t e where E total, E substrate, and E adsorbate represent the energy of adsorption structure, substrate, and adsorbate, respectively. The free energies have been calculated using the following Eq. (2). (2) G = E D F T + Z P E - T S where G, E DFT, ZPE, and TS represent the free energy, energy from DFT calculations, zero point energy, and entropic contributions, respectively. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Synthesis and structural characterization of Co-N/P-C In order to verify the effect of P introduction on the catalytic activity of Co atoms, Co-N/P-C was prepared through a two-step process (Scheme 1 ). Normally, the hollow nanocage structure of ZIF-8 (pore size (d p = 3.4 Å) and cavity diameter (d c = 11.6 Å)) enables encapsulating Co(acac)3 to create ZIF-8@Co(acac)3 precursor. As a result, it minimizes the aggregation of metal precursors during pyrolysis, which is more conducive to the formation of single atoms. Simultaneously, high shell coordination effect can be achieved by introducing P atoms through pyrolysis. It is noteworthy that the phosphorus penetrates into the ZIF-8 framework whereas the zinc is evaporated (>907 °C) during the pyrolysis process [52,53]. As comparisons, we also prepared Co-N-C (P free), N/P-C (P, N co-modified carbon), and N-C (N-modified carbon) derived from a similar method. In order to demonstrate that ZIF-8 maintained its original crystalline structure after the introduction of Co(acac)3, we undertook Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests for pure 2-methylimidazole, ZIF-8, and Co-ZIF-8. They were found to display similar vibrational peaks of C=N bonds in FTIR, indicating that cobalt is present in the form of small guest molecules and has not disrupted the original structure of ZIF-8 (Fig. S1). Meanwhile, XRD also confirmed the above-mentioned results (Fig. S2). The morphological features and microstructure of the target catalysts were characterized. By using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the Co-N/P-C appears as a hexagonal shape with a particle size of ∼30 nm (Fig. 2 a). As a consequence of the excellent mechanical strength and thermal stability, no structural collapse occurred for the catalyst after heat treatment, and the control samples showed analogous results (Figs. S3 and S4). As shown in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED), no metallic nanoparticles and alloy phases were present in the Co-N/P-C catalyst (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, the synthetic samples were characterized by powder XRD (Fig. S5) and Raman analysis (Fig. S6) by using correlative Raman/scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique [54]. No diffraction peaks of nanoparticles as well as their metallic phases were observed for both Co-N/P-C and control samples. The D band corresponds to the lattice distortion defects induced by Co and N co-doping, which modulates the charge transfer capability of the carbon support. The significantly enhanced I D/I G value (1.03) of Co-N/P-C indicates an increase in the degree of carbon defects with the introduction of P. Besides, the poor crystallinity after heat treatment also indicates that the carbon substrate is abundant with defects, promoting the anchoring of isolated metal atoms [55]. Hence, the Co species may be distributed as kinds of individual atoms on the amorphous NC support. We have also observed an abundant onion-like carbon in the carbon skeleton (Fig. 2c). The carbon of this structure is an amorphous carbon caused by the introduction of single atoms and nitrogen, indicative of the improvement of electrical conductivity [56,57]. No Co-containing nanoparticles were identified in high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, and the corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) elemental maps demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of C, N, Co, and P in the whole structure (Fig. 2d and e). Besides, the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM images revealed small bright spots evenly dispersed in the carbon skeleton, i.e., single Co atom marked with orange circles (Fig. 2f). However, P cannot be clearly identified due to its low atomic number. The mass percentages of Co and P in Co-N/P-C were 1.2 wt% and 0.67 wt%, respectively, which were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Isothermal nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements demonstrated that Co-N/P-C had a higher Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area (1032 m2 g−1) and average pore size (1.5 nm) compared to the control sample (Figs. S7 and S8). The data for the control samples are also present in Table S1. Under relatively low pressures, the BET curves exhibit significant hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of mesoporous structures. The curve suggests that the introduction of P assists to form a composited micro/mesoporous structure [58]. The large surface area (1032 m2 g−1) of Co-N/P-C is expected to expose more catalytically active sites, and the mesoporous and macroporous hybrids enable to improve mass transport during the catalysis [59,60]. 4.2 Electronic structure analysis of Co-N/P-C The electronic structure change is an important indication of the enhancement of the catalytic activity. The elemental information of Co-N/P-C and control samples was detected by XPS. As depicted in Fig. S9, XPS spectroscopy confirms successful introduction of P in N/P-C and Co-N/P-C. Furthermore, high-resolution P 2p XPS spectrum of Co-N/P-C revealed two peaks at 132.3 and 133.3 eV (Fig. 3 a), which can be assigned to P–C and P–N/P=N, respectively [61–63]. The results show that P atoms are successfully incorporated into the curved graphitic carbon. High-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) displayed four different components at 398.9 eV (pyridinic N), 399.8 eV (Co–N), 401.1 eV (pyrrolic N), and 402.6 eV (graphitic N). The corresponding ratios and contents of the different N species are summarized (Fig. S10 and Table S2). In contrast, Co-N/P-C possessed more pyrrole-N and pyridinic-N species, which is favorable for ORR reaction. The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum was classified into four peaks containing Co 2p 1/2, Co 2p 3/2, and the corresponding satellite peaks (Fig. 3c). The Co 2p spectra of Co-N-C and Co-N/P-C demonstrate peaks at 780.5 and 780.7 eV, which could be ascribed to Co 2p 3/2 orbitals [64,65]. This result is consistent with that obtained from Co K-edge XANES. Compared to Co-N-C, Co-N/P-C exhibits higher binding energies, indicating a lower valence state of Co. Therefore, the presence of phosphorus atoms can regulate the electronic structure of individual Co atoms in Co-N/P-C. The electronic states and geometrical configurations of Co in the catalyst were further revealed by XANES and EXAFS measurements. The Co-K edge spectra in XANES indicated that the near-edge absorption thresholds of Co-N-C and Co-N/P-C are located between Co foil and CoO, close to CoO, proving that the valence state of Co in Co-N/P-C is close to +2 (Fig. 3d). In addition, compared with Co-N-C, the near-edge absorption position of Co-N/P-C is moved towards higher binding energy, implying that the valence state of Co is lowered due to the electron transfer from P to Co (the inset in Fig. 3d). Fourier transform (FT)-EXAFS of Co-N/P-C and control samples was shown in Fig. 3(e). Compared with Co foils and CoO, Co-N/P-C exhibits only one primary peak at 1.5 Å, which can be attributed to the first coordination shell of Co–N. No significant Co–Co peaks were observed in the FT-EXAFS spectra of Co-N/P-C, which further corroborates the existence of isolated Co sites and agrees with the HAADF-STEM results. No Co–P bond was observed, indicating that the P atoms are located in a second shell coordination. As shown in Fig. 3(f) and Table S3, the quantitative structural parameters of Co in Co-N/P-C were obtained by least-squares EXAFS fitting. It was observed that the fitting curves matched well with the experiment spectra. Considering the adsorption of *OH, the Co coordination number is 6. The analysis shows that the coordination number of Co was ∼4, and the average bond length of Co–N is 1.98 Å. Based on the above analysis, a local atomic structure around Co can be constructed, demonstrating that the isolated Co atoms are tetra-coordinated with N atoms to form a Co-N4 structure anchored in a nitrogen-doped porous carbon matrix. Due to the robust resolution in both k and R space, the Co K-edge wavelet transform (WT)-EXAFS was applied to investigate the corresponding atomic configurations (Fig. 3g–i). In addition, compared with the WT signals of Co foil, no Co–Co coordination was observed in Co-N/P-C. These further identified the isolated feature of Co species in Co-N/P-C. For Co-N/P-C, only Co–N scattering path exists in FT-EXAFS spectra; no Co–P scattering path was found. No Co–P bonding was found in the EXAFS fitting data. N–P bonding exists in the N 1s spectrum of XPS. The above evidences confirm that the introduced P atom exists in the second shell coordination environment at the CoN4 site. In addition, compared with the WT signal of Co foil, the maximum peak value of Co-N/P-C is 4.9 Å. Due to the large atomic number of P/N and its robust scattering ability for photoelectrons, the intensity maxima of Co-N/P-C are significantly lower than Co-N-C at low Wave vector number (k). Based on the above analysis, P atom acts as an electron donor transferring electrons to Co atom, further optimizing the electronic configuration of the Co center, possibly adjusting the adsorption energy of intermediates during ORR at the Co active sites, thus promoting the ORR kinetics. 4.3 ORR activity of Co-N/P-C and corresponding electrochemical tests To confirm the improved electrochemical performance, the ORR performance of Co-N/P-C in 0.1 M KOH solution was evaluated by ORR polarization curve. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve shows an obvious reduction peak, indicating that the catalyst possesses satisfactory reactivity (Fig. S11). Then, the ORR electrochemical properties were evaluated. Fig. 4 (a) shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the ORR at 1600 r min−1, in which Co-N/P-C holds the most positive onset potential (E onset = 0.97 V) and half-wave potential (E 1/2 = 0.89 V), and has the large limiting current density (5.15 mA cm−2), exceeding 20% Pt/C and other samples (Table S4). Half-wave potential is closely related to the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Compared with Co-N/P-C, Co-N-C exhibits higher limiting current density, but its half-wave potential is inferior to that of Co-N/P-C. It proved that the introduction of P significantly enhanced the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. This indicates that the co-presence of Co and P is more conducive to the electron transport process, resulting in better ORR activity of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the Tafel plots of Co-N/P-C as well as reference samples are calculated from corresponding LSV curves at 1600 r min−1. Smaller Tafel slope of Co-N/P-C indicates that it has faster electrochemical reaction kinetics. Moreover, all the most positive onset potential, half-wave potential, and the smallest Tafel slope value (68.37 mV dec−1) indicate that Co-N/P-C is the optimal catalyst for ORR (Fig. 4c). The onset potentials, half-wave potentials, and Tafel slopes of Co-N/P-C as well as the comparison samples were compared (Fig. 4c), confirming the excellent ORR catalytic activity. In order to verify whether the catalytic process of Co-N/P-C is a 2-electron or 4-electron process, it was tested by rotating disk electrodes (RDE) (Fig. 4d). The RDE is constructed differently from the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE), where the two electrodes produced by PINE Company have different areas, so the LSV curve produced by the test will be different (Fig. 4a and d). The electron transfer number is 3.88, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 5.7% (Fig. 4e), indicating that the ORR process on Co-N/P-C underwent mainly a 4e− reduction pathway. The corresponding Koutechy-Levich (K-L) curves were also obtained based on LSVs at different rotational speeds, and the results obtained for n were also similar to the above results, indicating that the results are consistent with the first-order reaction kinetics (Fig. S12). For practical applications, the methanol tolerance was measured. It can be seen that there is no significant change in the current density after dropping methanol, indicating that Co-N/P-C has good methanol tolerance (Fig. 4f). Electrochemical impedance spectra were used to compare the impedance values of the prepared samples. The results are shown in Fig. S13, while the R ct values are statistically presented in Table S5. The smallest R ct (40 Ω) values indicate more favorable charge transfer, which is one of the reasons for the superior ORR activity of Co-N/P-C. The cycle stability evaluation for the catalysts was assessed by the accelerated durability test (ADT). There was no significant change in the half-wave potential of the catalyst, and only a slight drop in current occurred after 5000 potential cycles, implying that Co-N/P-C possessed the satisfactory stability (Fig. S14). The ADT test and fuel cell crossover effect test uncover that Co-N/P-C promises for the practical application. The performance of the most optimal electrocatalysts for ORR here was compared with other highly active catalysts in the recently literature (Table S6). The abundant pore structure in the catalyst facilitates the exposure of active sites, accelerates the mass transfer rate, and promotes the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, for comparison, acid ORR activity was assessed (Fig. S15). We also conducted electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) test to verify the catalyst activity (Fig. S16 and Table S7). 4.4 Co-N/P-C based zinc-air battery performance evaluation In order to confirm the feasibility of the practical application of the catalyst, we tested the zinc-air battery (ZAB) with Co-N/P-C supported by carbon paper as the cathode catalyst. For comparison, another battery containing Pt/C as an electrocatalyst was assembled at the air cathode. Fig. 5 (a) is a schematic of a full zinc-air battery installation. The open-circuit voltage (OCV) of Co-N/P-C based zinc-air cell can reach 1.52 V (Fig. 5b), and the assembled battery can lighten the light-emitting diodes with the “JLU*MSE” character, which also confirms its good prospects in practical electronic devices (Fig. 5c). The corresponding OCV curve is also obtained by electrochemical test, which is close to the value measured by multimeter (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, the specific capacity of Co-N/P-C based zinc-air battery reached up to 790.0 mA h gZn −1, close to the theoretical capacity (820 mA h gZn −1) value (Fig. 5e). The maximum power density has already reached 173.9 mW cm−2, which exceeds the 20% Pt/C based battery (Fig. 5f). The full discharge curve also confirms its sustainability as a device for practical electronic applications (Fig. 5g). The performance of two zinc-air batteries was further evaluated by the discharge curves at different current densities, namely, at the low current density of 2, 6, 8, and 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5h) and at the high current density of 5, 10, 25, and 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5i). The test results show that the constant discharge voltage plateau curve of the Co-N/P-C based zinc-air cell is stable and higher than that of 20% Pt/C based zinc-air battery under different current densities, indicating its superior rate capacity and stability. The practical application of electronic devices stems from the excellent ORR activity of the materials, which also confirms the application potential in energy conversion devices. Meanwhile, OER tests and the stability of ZABs were conducted (Figs. S17 and S18). 5 Conclusions In summary, by modulating the second shell-layer coordination structure of cobalt atoms through introducing P atoms, a new-type single-atom Co-N/P-C material was architected for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. HAADF-STEM images and XAFS measurements demonstrate that the Co metal atoms are evenly dispersed on the curved carbon substrate. FT-EXAFS and DFT calculations indicate that the phosphorus atom is located in the second coordination shell of the cobalt center. The introduction of P optimizes the Co 3d electron orbital, hence facilitating the *OOH adsorption to accelerate the ORR process. Therefore, Co-N/P-C exhibits excellent ORR catalytic activity under alkaline conditions. Moreover, the assembled Co-N/P-C based rechargeable zinc-air battery demonstrates good specific capacity and power density, reflecting its practical application promise. Our work has not only achieved rational design and precise synthesis of heterogeneous atom-based single-atom catalysts, but also has gained the further insight into the active sites.

        "dc:description": "Atom-level modulation of the coordination environment for single-atom catalysts (SACs) is considered as an effective strategy for elevating the catalytic performance. For the MN x site, breaking the symmetrical geometry and charge distribution by introducing relatively weak electronegative atoms into the first/second shell is an efficient way, but it remains challenging for elucidating the underlying mechanism of interaction. Herein, a practical strategy was reported to rationally design single cobalt atoms coordinated with both phosphorus and nitrogen atoms in a hierarchically porous carbon derived from metal-organic frameworks. X-ray absorption spectrum reveals that atomically dispersed Co sites are coordinated with four N atoms in the first shell and varying numbers of P atoms in the second shell (denoted as Co-N/P-C). The prepared catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity as well as zinc-air battery performance. The introduction of P atoms in the Co-SACs weakens the interaction between Co and N, significantly promoting the adsorption process of *OOH, resulting in the acceleration of reaction kinetics and reduction of thermodynamic barrier, responsible for the increased intrinsic activity. Our discovery provides insights into an ultimate design of single-atom catalysts with adjustable electrocatalytic activities for efficient electrochemical energy conversion.",
