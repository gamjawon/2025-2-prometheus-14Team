The catalytic oxidation technique has been generally acknowledged as an extremely effective way of removing highly toxic CO, where the key is to develop catalysts with high activity as well as stability. In this work, the MgFe2O4 supported monometallic Pt-based and Au-based catalysts as well as bimetallic AuPt catalysts have been prepared through a sol-immobilization method and applied to the oxidation reaction of highly toxic CO. It was found that adding an appropriate amount of Au (0.6 wt.%) to 1Pt/MgFe2O4 significantly enhances its catalytic activity and stability. During the stability test of 20 h, the 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst demonstrated high and stable CO conversion of 100 % at 165 °C and WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. Various characterization techniques such as ICP, XRD, STEM, EDS, XPS, and CO-TPD reveal that the bimetallic nanoparticles composed of Au and Pt have formed in bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts, where Pt donates electrons to Au. A more positive electronic state of Pt in 0.6Au–1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au–1Pt/MgFe2O4 helps to reduce the adsorption strength of CO on catalysts, resulting the better CO oxidation performance compared with monometallic 1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst. These insights into the crucial structure needed for highly active and stable Pt catalysts in CO oxidation will contribute to designing even more excellent catalysts for CO oxidation in the future.

CO is a highly toxic molecule, and inhaling CO can result in damage to the nervous system and even death, causing significant threat to human health. In addition, CO is widely recognized as a poison for the Fe-based catalysts in ammonia synthesis reaction [5], the Pt catalysts employed at the anode of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells [6], and so on. Therefore, CO removal has attracted more and more attention. Many technologies have been developed to remove CO, such as adsorption, membrane separation, catalytic oxidation and so on [7]. Among them, catalytic oxidation is considered one of the most promising technologies due to its lower reaction temperature, higher efficiency, and absence of generation of secondary pollution. Transition-metal oxide catalysts (e.g., MnO2 [8], CuO [9] and Co3O4 [10]) and noble metal (e.g., Pt [11], Au [12] and Pd [13]) catalysts are considered as efficient catalysts for oxidizing of CO. Despite transition-metal oxide catalysts show promise for abundance and low price, their activity for oxidizing of CO is significantly lower compared to noble metal catalysts. Among these noble metals, Pt catalysts are promising oxidizing catalysts and have been widely used in oxidizing of formaldehyde [14], CO [15] and propane [16], and so on. The modification of Pt nanoparticles with a secondary noble metal is well recognized as one of the effective methods to enhance the performance of Pt nanoparticles. For instance, Huang et al. developed a photodeposition method to prepare AuPt bimetallic nanoparticles supported on TiO2 materials for the oxidation of formaldehyde. The results revealed that the resulting alloyed Au-Pt/TiO2 demonstrated an improved catalytic performance in comparison with monometallic Au/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 nanocatalysts [17]. Elsewhere, Thomas et al. found that the AuPt/SiO2 catalyst with an appropriate Au/Pt ratio exhibits higher activity in CO oxidation compared to monometallic Au or Pt catalysts [18]. It is well known that the support material is also crucial in preparing highly efficient CO oxidation catalysts. The catalyst supports for the oxidation of CO can be mainly divided into two types: reducible supports, such as FeOx, CeO2, TiO2, etc., and nonreducible supports, such as Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, etc. [19]. Compared to nonreducible supports, metal catalysts supported on reducible supports typically exhibit higher performance in CO oxidation reactions because of their good ability to activate oxygen. Among various reducible metal oxides, FeOx has been proven to be a favorable support to prepare high-performance Pt catalysts used in CO oxidation [20–22]. However, as a single metal oxide, FeOx exhibits relatively poor thermal stability and lower surface area, which may result in a limited amount of reactive oxygen species produced. Nanostructured spinel-type oxides with the formula of AB2O4 are promising catalyst supports because of their high surface area and exceptional thermal and mechanical stability. Based on these considerations, the use of iron-based spinel as a support for CO oxidation catalyst holds great promise. Based on the above consideration, in this study, the MgFe2O4 supported Pt, Au and AuPt catalysts were synthesized and used to catalyze CO oxidation reaction. The activity and stability of Pt/MgFe2O4 for oxidation of CO increase as increasing Au loading, and then stabilize. The 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 shows a high catalytic activity (T90 = 150 °C) as well as excellent stability at 165 °C and WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1 during 20 h stability tests. The composition and structures for monometallic Pt/MgFe2O4 and Au/MgFe2O4 catalysts, as well as bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts, were explored using characterization techniques of ICP, XRD, STEM, EDS, XPS, and CO-TPD, revealing the structure-performance relationship. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of MgFe2O4 support and xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts The MgFe2O4 support was prepared by the mixing and grounding of MgSO4 with Fe(NO3)3⋅9H2O, NaOH and NaCl which we previously reported [23]. It was then calcined at 700 °C for 1 h and subsequently rinsed several times with deionized water as well as dried at 120 °C. xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts were prepared by a sol-immobilization method. Briefly, a certain amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O and HAuCl4·6H2O were poured into deionized water (200 mL) and continuously stirred. Next, 0.2 mol/L of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution was poured into this solution. A molar ratio of total metal ions to PVP is maintained at 1:6. After stirring the mixed solution in an ice water bath for 30 min, a certain amount of freshly prepared 0.1 mol/L NaBH4 solution was dropped into this mixed solution with a molar ratio of total metal ions to NaBH4 being 1:5 before continued stirring for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, the MgFe2O4 support was introduced into the mixed solution. Then 0.1 mol/L HCl solution was introduced for the purpose of adjusting the pH values to 3. After stirring for 2 h, the obtained mixture was firstly filtered and rinsed with deionized water, and subsequently dried overnight at 60 °C and calcined at 500 °C. The resulting catalyst is denoted as xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4, where x and y are the Au and Pt nominal loadings, respectively. 2.2 Characterization methods of the catalysts The actual loadings of Au and Pt for xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 were quantitatively analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 5110). The crystallite phase structure of xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 was analyzed using the SmartLab SE model X-ray diffractometer (XRD) in a 2θ range of 25–80°, operating at a scanning speed of 2 o/min and utilizing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 and the corresponding elemental mapping images were acquired using a JEM-2100 F apparatus that includes an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford instruments). The oxidation states and composition of elements in xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi instruments) with an Al Kα radiation. The C 1 s peak, with a binding energy of 284.6 eV, was employed for calibrating the obtained binding energies on all xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 samples. The CO-TPD (CO temperature-programmed desorption) was performed with Bel Cata II apparatus that was integrated with a mass spectrometer. Ahead of CO molecule adsorption, a 0.1 g sample was treated with He gas at 300 °C for 30 min. Once cooled to 50 oC under He atmosphere, He gas was changed into 10 vol.% CO/He gas mixture for 1 h to achieve saturated CO adsorption. Next, the gas was changed from a mixture of 10 vol.% CO/He into pure He gas to sweep weakly adsorbed CO from the sample surface, followed by heating the sample to 900 °C under He atmosphere, and recording the mass signals for m/z = 28 (CO) and 44 (CO2). 2.3 Catalytic performance testing The catalytic activity and stability evaluation were conducted under ambient pressure using a fixed-bed quartz tubular microreactor with a 10 mm inner diameter. The reaction feed gas composition is made up of 1 vol.% CO, 1 vol.% O2 as well as 98 vol.% N2. For each instance of activity and stability tests, the total flow rate for the reaction feed gas is accurately set to 25 mL/min, and the catalysts (50 mg) and quartz sand (1 g) were evenly mixed for use. The corresponding weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) has been precisely calculated as 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. A K-type thermocouple, positioned inside the catalyst bed, was employed for monitoring the actual reaction temperature. The CO concentration in the reactant gas both before and after passing through the catalyst was measured by FGA 10 infrared gas analyzer. The conversion of the reactant CO has been determined in accordance with equations of XCO = (CCO, in − CCO, out)/CCO, in × 100 %, in which CCO, in and CCO, out denote the CO concentration at reaction feed gas and exhaust gas, respectively. The deactivation rates were calculated using the equations of deactivation rates = (XCO, initial - XCO, final)/(tfinal - tinitial). 3 Results 3.1 Catalytic performance for CO oxidation Fig. 1a displays the CO conversion curves for 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4, 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 catalysts in the temperature range of 30–280 ℃ at WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. The temperatures at which CO conversion reaches 10 %, 50 %, and 90 % are denoted as T10, T50, and T90, respectively, and the corresponding data can be found in Table S1. The temperatures corresponding to T10, T50 and T90 for 1Pt/MgFe2O4 are 105, 154 and 170 ℃, respectively, and the conversion of CO reached 100 % at 171 ℃. For 0.6Au/MgFe2O4, the corresponding T10, T50 and T90 have increased to 121, 176 and 208 ℃, respectively, and the CO conversion reached 100 % at 223 ℃. However, similar T10, T50 and T90 values were obtained for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4, equal to 89, 129, 150 ℃ for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 82, 125, 149 ℃ for 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4, respectively. These values are lower than those obtained on 1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4. For the MgFe2O4 support, the values of T10, T50 and T90 are as high as 189, 234 and 246 ℃, respectively (Fig. S1 and Table S1). A blank test was also performed with an empty reactor (without catalyst) under the same reaction conditions, and almost no CO conversion was observed in the temperature range of 25–280 ℃ (Fig. S1). The corresponding values of apparent activation energy (Ea) over 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 were tested by controlling the conversion of CO to <20 % (Fig. 1b). The Ea values on 1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 were calculated to be 62.3 and 98.3 kJ/mol, respectively, as listed in Table 1 . The 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts exhibit similar Ea values of 44.3 and 45.5 kJ/mol, respectively, which are notably lower than those of the 1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4. The lower Ea values indicate the higher activity of 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 in CO oxidation reaction. Fig. 2 presents the catalytic stability test results of 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 at 165 °C and WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. As can be seen from the figures, the 1Pt/MgFe2O4 exhibits obvious deactivation with CO conversion decreasing from 72 % to 23 % during the 20 h stability tests, while that of 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 remains at ∼38 % in a total test time. However, the 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 demonstrate stable and high CO conversion of 100 % within the entire stability test period of 20 h. The catalytic stability of the xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 was further evaluated at a higher WHSV of 43,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1 in order to expedite the observation of deactivation if it occurs. The results are shown in Fig. S2. The 1Pt/MgFe2O4 exhibited a significant decrease in CO conversion from 40.4 % to 25.3 % within the first 0.5 h. However, the CO conversion over 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 only slightly decreased in the first 0.5 h, dropping from 94.9 % and 98.9 % to 93.9 % and 95.9 %, respectively. The deactivation rates for 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 are 30.2, 2.0, and 6.0 %/h in the first 0.5 h, respectively. Throughout the entire 3 h test period, these deactivation rates are 7.4, 2.7, and 4.1 %/h, respectively. These results indicate that the presence of Au promotes the stability of Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. 3.2 Catalyst structure exploration The Au and Pt loading in the xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts were detected via ICP-OES, and the corresponding data can be found in Table 1. It was found that the actual loadings of Au and Pt in all xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts are very close to the nominal values. The XRD patterns of the xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that all catalysts exhibit diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 53.5°, 57.1°, 62.7°, and 74.1°, which correspond to the characteristic diffraction peaks of MgFe2O4 (JCPDS 73–1720) [24]. Fig. 4 shows the STEM images and the representative elemental line scan results of individual metal nanoparticles for xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. According to the size statistics of over 300 particles, it was found that the Pt mean particle size for 1Pt/MgFe2O4 is 2.6 nm (Fig. 4a). With introduction of 0.6 wt.% Au into the 1Pt/MgFe2O4, the Au and Pt formed bimetallic nanoparticles of 4.5 nm (Fig. 4c), which will be verified by the elemental line-scanning analysis results below (Fig. 4g). For 0.6Au/MgFe2O4, the Au mean particle size was measured to be 5.4 nm (Fig. 4e). To explore the distribution of Au and Pt elements in the metallic nanoparticles for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4, elemental line-scanning analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4g, the signals of Au and Pt in 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 exhibit similar trends, indicating uniform distribution of Au and Pt elements within the bimetallic particles and intimate contact between Au and Pt. As observed from the EDS mapping images of bimetallic 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst, it was found that Au and Pt elements exhibit homogeneous dispersion on the surface of MgFe2O4 support (Fig. 5 ). More EDS mapping images for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst are presented in Fig. S3. XPS was used to analyzed the chemical valences of gold and platinum species in xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. Fig. S4 shows the XPS survey spectra for 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4, 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4. The results indicate that Mg, Fe and O elements are present in all xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4. Additionally, 1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 also contain Pt and Au elements, respectively. The 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 contain both Pt and Au elements. Fig. 6a shows the Pt 4f XPS spectra of xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. The Pt 4f XPS spectra for the 1Pt/MgFe2O4 could be fitted well with six peaks with Pt 4f7/2 BEs at 71.0, 72.4 and 74.2 eV and Pt 4f5/2 BEs at 74.4, 75.6 and 77.6 eV, respectively. The peaks observed at 71.0 and 74.4 eV are associated with the Pt0 species, while those observed at 72.4 and 75.6 eV are associated with the Pt2+ species, and those observed at 74.2 and 77.6 eV are associated with the Pt4+ species [25,26]. As for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts, the binding energies of all Pt species are identical, with each Pt species exhibiting a 0.2 eV increase in binding energy compared to 1Pt/MgFe2O4, resulting in a more positive binding energy of Pt species. Fig. 6b presents the Au 4f spectra of the xAu-yPt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. The 0.6Au/MgFe2O4 displays three fitted peaks at binding energy of 83.7, 87.4 and 88.0 eV, which could be attributed to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 for Au0 and Mg 2 s for Mg2+ [27], respectively. The binding energies of Mg 2 s for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 are the same with 0.6Au/MgFe2O4. However, Au0 4f7/2 and Au0 4f5/2 show a decrease in binding energy by 0.2 eV compared to 0.6Au/MgFe2O4. These results indicate the electron donation from Pt to Au within bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts, implying electronic interaction existing between Au and Pt. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations reported in the literature, a more positive binding energy of Pt species on Pt/X-graphene helps to weaken the CO adsorption, thereby enhancing the performance of Pt catalysts in CO oxidation reactions and alleviating the CO poisoning of Pt catalysts [28]. A more positive binding energy of Pt species in 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 exhibit weaker CO adsorption strength, which can be confirmed by subsequent CO-TPD characterization. Fig. 7 displays the CO-TPD curves of the 1Pt/MgFe2O4, 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts. All these three catalysts show small CO desorption peaks and large CO2 desorption peaks. The generation of CO2 is caused by the reaction between the adsorbed CO species on the catalyst and the oxygen species released by the support. The desorption peak of CO on the 1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst starts at 286 °C, while the desorption of CO for 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 begins at 215 °C. The lower the desorption temperature of CO on the 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 indicates that CO has a relatively weak adsorption strength on them. XPS results reveals that 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 exhibited a more positive binding energy of Pt than that in 1Pt/MgFe2O4, which helps to weaken the CO adsorption [28]. It was reported that the strongly adsorbed CO on Pt catalysts would be unfavorable for O2 adsorption and activation, thus resulting in a lower CO oxidation activity [29–31]. The total desorption peak areas of CO and CO2 on 1Pt/MgFe2O4 is significantly higher than that on 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4. It indicates that the adsorption amount of CO on 1Pt/MgFe2O4 is significantly higher than that on 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 because the generation of CO2 originates from CO, which may be due to the weaker CO adsorption strength on 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4. 4 Discussion Adding a certain amount of Au to 1Pt/MgFe2O4 can significantly enhance its catalytic activity and stability for oxidizing of CO (Figs. 1, 2 and S2). The values of the apparent activation energies over 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 are similar and low, around 45 kJ/mol (Table 1). The bimetallic 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts exhibit 100 % CO conversion in the CO oxidation reaction at 165 °C over a 20 h period at WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. STEM and elemental line scan results disclosed that Au is close contact with Pt (Figs. 4g and 5). The XPS results indicate that the electronic interaction occurred between Au and Pt for Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst with electrons transferring from Pt to Au, which results in more positive electronic properties of Pt in the bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts compared to the monometallic Pt catalysts (Fig. 6). From the CO-TPD data, it was found that decorating Pt with Au weakens the adsorption strength and adsorption amount of CO on the catalyst (Fig. 7). It was widely reported that a strong adsorption of CO on the surface of Pt catalysts will significantly reduce the low temperature activity of Pt (i.e., CO poisoning) in CO oxidation reaction [30,32]. According to the above reaction and characterization results, it has been shown that incorporating Au into Pt makes Pt more positively charged, which helps to reduce adsorption strength of CO, and therefore enhancing the activity of Pt catalysts for CO oxidation. 5 Conclusions In summary, the results of this research show that the activity as well as stability of supported Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst for oxidizing of CO can be significantly enhanced by modifying with Au. At 165 °C and WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1, the 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst achieved a high and stable 100 % CO conversion within a stability test lasting 20 h. A series of characterization results revealed that adding Au to Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst increases the size of metal nanoparticles. The Au and Pt are in close contact in bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts with electronic interaction. The electron transfer occurs from Pt to Au, which resulted in more positive electronic properties of Pt for Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts in comparison to the monometallic Pt catalysts. This reduces the CO adsorption strength on Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst, thus boosting the catalytic performance of Pt/MgFe2O4 for oxidizing of CO. This research provided the useful guidance in the preparation of Pt catalysts with superior activity and stability for oxidizing highly toxic CO.

        "dc:description": "The catalytic oxidation technique has been generally acknowledged as an extremely effective way of removing highly toxic CO, where the key is to develop catalysts with high activity as well as stability. In this work, the MgFe2O4 supported monometallic Pt-based and Au-based catalysts as well as bimetallic AuPt catalysts have been prepared through a sol-immobilization method and applied to the oxidation reaction of highly toxic CO. It was found that adding an appropriate amount of Au (0.6 wt.%) to 1Pt/MgFe2O4 significantly enhances its catalytic activity and stability. During the stability test of 20 h, the 0.6Au-1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst demonstrated high and stable CO conversion of 100 % at 165 °C and WHSV = 30,000 mL gcat. −1 h−1. Various characterization techniques such as ICP, XRD, STEM, EDS, XPS, and CO-TPD reveal that the bimetallic nanoparticles composed of Au and Pt have formed in bimetallic Au-Pt/MgFe2O4 catalysts, where Pt donates electrons to Au. A more positive electronic state of Pt in 0.6Au–1Pt/MgFe2O4 and 1Au–1Pt/MgFe2O4 helps to reduce the adsorption strength of CO on catalysts, resulting the better CO oxidation performance compared with monometallic 1Pt/MgFe2O4 catalyst. These insights into the crucial structure needed for highly active and stable Pt catalysts in CO oxidation will contribute to designing even more excellent catalysts for CO oxidation in the future.",
