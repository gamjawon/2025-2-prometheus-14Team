Erhan Aksoylu, Z. hsen Onsan* Department of Chemical Engineering, Bo~azid University, 80815 Bebek, lstanbul. Turkey Received 10 February 1997; received in revised form 15 April 1997; accepted 15 April 1997 Abstract A group of Ni/A1203 catalysts having metal contents in the 0-16.5 wt% range were prepared using coprecipitation and impregnation methods. The catalysts were reduced under the same conditions; the reaction conditions were also fixed in similar sets of experiments for better comparison. Total surface area, total pore volume, metal surface area, and both the CO hydrogenation and CO2 methanation activities of the catalysts were studied in order to compare the effect of preparation method on structural properties as well as on catalyst activity and selectivity. A comparison of CO hydrogenation results on catalysts with similar nickel loadings indicates that coprecipitated catalysts have higher productivity and C2-C4 hydrocarbon selectivity, whereas impregnated catalysts yield better olefin/paraffin ratios for the C2-C3 hydrocarbons. In CO2 methanation, coprecipitated catalysts show higher methanation activity and lower CO production level per methane produced for all nickel loadings investigated. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Catalyst preparation procedure itself is one of the most important parameters that affects characteristics like total surface area (TSA), total pore volume (TPV), metal surface area (MSA) and hence catalytic activity/ selectivity. It is reported that product selectivity may be changed by improving the interacting ability of the metal and the support by structural modification [ 1-3]. The use of Ni-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides is well established [ 1-5]. Most of the work published have focused on the use of impreg- *Corresponding author.

Since the data presented in the literature have been obtained by using various catalysts under a wide range of reaction conditions [1-8], it is difficult to make a sound comparison between catalysts pre- pared by different methods. The present study was carried out to compare a range of Ni/A1203 catalysts prepared by impregnation and coprecipitation methods under the same set of reaction conditions. TSA, TPV and MSA values were determined for all the samples with metal contents in the range 0-16.5 wt% Ni. CO hydrogenation experi- ments were carried out at 523 K using two different CO concentrations and H2/CO ratios in the feed. CO2 methanation tests, also carried out at the same tern- 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)0015 1-8 2 A.E. Aksoylu, ZI. Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 perature, were used as a probe to confirm the trends observed in CO hydrogenation. Changes in activity, product distribution and selectivity with increasing nickel content were investigated for the catalysts prepared by each method. Furthermore, as the catalyst samples prepared by coprecipitation or impregnation had nearly the same metal contents, comparison on the basis of preparation method was possible. Since all other parameters except the catalyst used were kept fixed in each experiment, this study is notable in allowing a direct comparison of catalyst preparation methods in terms of structural properties and catalytic performances in the range of nickel loadings consid- ered. were determined using a Varian 250 Plus atomic absorption spectrometer and were found as 5, 11 and 16.5 wt% Ni, respectively. Sodium contents were also determined by the same method; no sodium was detected in the final catalyst samples. Impregnated catalysts containing 5, 10 and 15 wt% Ni on alumina were prepared by the conventional incipient wetness impregnation technique. Commer- cial alumina (Alcoa, 218 m2/g TSA, 200-250~tm) was impregnated with an appropriate quantity of aqueous Ni(NO3)2 solution. The concentration of the precursor solution was changed according to the target metal loading. The resulting mixture was then dried in air at 323 K for 15 h and at 393 K for 3 h followed by calcination in air at 623 K for 4 h. 2. Experimental 2.2. Pretreatment The coprecipitated Ni/A1203 samples (0, 5, 11, 16.5 wt%) and impregnated Ni/A1203 samples (0, 5, 10, 15 wt%) were examined by TSA, TPV and MSA measurements. The CO hydrogenation activity and selectivity tests for all samples were conducted under reaction-controlled conditions at 523 K and for H2/CO=2 and H2/CO=1/2 in the feed, while the CO2 hydrogenation tests were conducted at the same temperature for a H2/CO2 ratio of 2 in the feed. The feed was diluted in each run with He to keep the space velocity fixed at 22 250 1/kg h for both CO and CO2 hydrogenation experiments. Internal and external mass transfer effects were found to be negligible under the operating conditions used. 2.1. Catalyst preparation Coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts containing 5, 11 and 16.5 wt% Ni were prepared in a semibatch system by changing pH coprecipitation from nickel nitrate and aluminum nitrate solutions with sodium hydro- xide [6,9,10]. The concentration and rate of addition of nickel nitrate solution were varied to obtain copre- cipitated Ni/AI203 catalysts with different metal load- ings. A catalyst containing 0 wt% Ni (only A1203) was also prepared by modifying the same procedure and was used as reference in all experiments performed with coprecipitated samples. The precipitate was fil- tered and washed six times, vacuum dried at 378 K for 24 h and then sieved to 200-250 ~m. Metal loadings All impregnated and coprecipitated catalyst sam- ples were reduced in situ in a stream of 30 ml/min pure hydrogen at 623 K for 3 h and then flushed with 30 ml/ min of helium at the same temperature for 30 min. In a second reduction scheme, coprecipitated samples were reduced at 623 K for 16 h under 100 ml/min pure hyrogen flow. 2.3. Structural measurements The TSA and the TPV were measured using a Micromeritics Flowsorb 11-2300 system. TSA of the reduced catalyst samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption from Nz-He mixtures using a multipoint technique. TPV measurements were made by using the nitrogen adsorption-desorption method. The MSA of the reduced catalyst samples were determined by irreversible CO adsorption at 303 K by using a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas chromato- graph fitted with a TCD and a 50 cm long 3 mm i.d. stainless steel column packed with catalyst particles. The CO uptake was measured by injecting successive CO samples via a calibrated 0.5 ml loop into 25 ml/ min He carrier until constant peak area was reached. In the calculations, Ni particles were taken to be spherical and the number of metal atoms per square meter of Ni was taken as 1.55 x 1019 [6,11,12]. Surface spectroscopy indicates that CO is molecu- larly adsorbed on Ni, Ru and Co at room temperature [13], and it is also reported that on Ni/AI203 catalysts A.E. Aksoylu, Z.L Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 3 CO adsorbs only on the Ni surface at 300 K in He flow [14]. The metal surface area of Ni catalysts supported on A1203 coming from different origins has been calculated via CO adsorption at 300 K by taking CO/Ni stoichiometry as unity [15]. In recent publica- tions, CO adsorption has been used to determine active metal surface area (MSA) and/or metal dispersion with the same assumption for different transition metals on different supports. For example, the MSA of Co in Co/WO3-A1203 [16], the MSA of Ni in coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts having Ni loads between 0 and 25 wt% [6], the MSA of Pt and Ni in Pt/A1203, Ni/MgO, Pt-Ni/MgO catalysts [17], and metal dispersion of Co and Ru in magnesium, vana- dium or cerium oxide promoted Co and Ru catalysts on carbon [18] were determined by using a CO/metal adsorption stoichiometry of unity. Moreover, it has been confirmed that the CO adsorption stoichiometry for Co is unity by MSA and TSA measurements using H2, CO and N2 adsorption conducted on coprecipi- tated Co/A1203 catalysts containing up to 100 wt% Co [19,20]. 2.4. Reaction experiments Both CO hydrogenation and CO2 methanation tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure and 523 K using a stainless steel flow system equipped with a fixed bed microreactor containing 270+2mg of reduced catalyst sample. The 3.5 mm i.d. stainless steel reactor tube was externally heated in a 2.4 cm i.d. tube furnace controlled to .5 K by a Shimaden FP-21 programmable temperature controller. Research grade reactants and inert gases (99.99%) from pressurized cylinders were passed through mole- cular sieve and silica gel traps before entering the flow system. All gas flow rates were controlled by cali- brated Omega mass flow controllers. The reduction of catalyst samples was carried out in situ before each experiment. Each reaction experiment was done by using a fresh catalyst sample with the aim of avoiding activity loss or any permanent change which cannot be recovered by reactivation. In CO hydrogenation experiments, the feed composition and the space velocity given above were selected in such a way as to guarantee conver- sions below 15% with the aim of avoiding mass transfer limitations. The feed and product gases were analyzed by the on-line Shimadzu GC-14A program- mable gas chromatograph connected to a Shimadzu CR-4A data processor. 2 mm mm Propak Q (80- 100 mesh) column and a TCD were used in the analyses conducted at 363 K under 25 ml/min carrier (He) flow. Product samples were taken after 2, 4 and 6 h on- stream, and data obtained after 2 h on-stream are reported in this paper since catalyst deactivation was not significant. The maximum loss in activity was 2% for CO hydrogenation using He/CO=2/1 and negligible for CO2 methanation. The highest loss in activity was 7% for CO hydrogenation over 16.5 wt% Ni/A1203 using H2/CO=1/2 after 6h on-stream. Changes in product distribution with time-on-stream were negligible under all conditions. 3. Results and discussion A series of coprecipitated and impregnated Ni/ AI203 catalysts were prepared. Preparation methods reported in literature were modified for preparing coprecipitated catalysts that have different metal load- ings [6,10]. Impregnated catalysts were prepared by the conventional wet impregnation technique [3]. 3.1. Catalyst structure The data on the physical characterization of the catalysts are given in Table 1 for all the catalyst samples prepared. The changes in the TSA and TPV of coprecipitated catalysts with metal loading, determined after 16 h reduction at 623 K, have pre- viously been discussed [6]. In coprecipitated catalysts, the interaction between metal and support is complete in the oxide form, and as a result, the structure formed after reduction includes paracrystalline nickel parti- cles decorated by the A1203 and NiA1204 phases [11]. The relative importance of the metal changes with catalyst composition; at low metal loadings alumina skeleton is likely to predominate but as the nickel content increases, Ni suspended on an alumina/alu- minate framework is expected to become more impor- tant. The range of Ni loadings investigated clearly indicates the increase in TSA and TPV of coprecipi- tated samples with increasing metal content, verifying the fact that metal does not accumulate on the surface 4 A.E.

XRD analyses have established the pre- sence of Ni metal in these catalysts [22]. For the catalysts prepared by impregnation, on the other hand, TSA and TPV decrease with metal load- ing. The usual explanation for the loss of surface area at high loadings for impregnated catalysts is possible pore blockage by excess nickel. When MSA values are considered, two important points need to be discussed. Firstly, the MSA values obtained for coprecipitated samples after 3 h and 16 h of reduction can be compared. The values given in Table 1 show that for the 5 wt% Ni sample, the difference in active metal surface obtained with these two reduction schemes is nearly 35% in favor of 16 h reduction, while those for the 11 and 16.5 wt% Ni samples are smaller. An explanation is provided by the fact that, at low metal loadings, the alumina skeleton dominates the structure of the catalyst and the Ni atoms/crystals are most probably embedded in this structure where they cannot be reduced easily. As the metal content increases, the transition from oxide form to reduced metal form becomes much easier. This is evident from the MSA reported for the 11 wt% Ni/AI203 samples reduced for 3 and 16 h periods. The difference observed in the MSA values of 16.5 wt% Ni/A1203 is larger, which could be a clue to the fact that the metal starts forming its own pore structure leading to the formation of relatively larger metallic crystals for which reduction to metal is much harder compared to smaller and more uniformly distributed metallic crystals of the 11 wt% Ni sample. For the sake of direct comparison with impregnated samples, the 3 h reduction scheme was applied to the catalyst samples used in most of the reaction experiments. Secondly, a comparison can be made between MSA values of coprecipitated and impregnated samples reduced for 3 h. Table 1 shows that the MSA of coprecipitated samples having similar metal content are larger than those of impregnated samples. This is possibly due to the formation of Ni clusters with large diameter on impregnated samples. The decrease in the TSA and TPV values with increasing metal content supports the idea of accumulation of metal atoms on the surface inside the pores. Consequently, the forma- tion of larger crystallites as compared to coprecipi- tated samples is likely, and this may lead to low MSA values. For coprecipitated samples, on the other hand, homogeneous distribution of metal atoms in the struc- tural framework even at higher metal loadings, and increasing TSA and TPV may lead to smaller Ni crystallites compared to impregnated samples having similar Ni content, resulting in the higher MSA values observed. An alternative way of evaluating the data can be based on the (MSA/TSA) values that are given in Table 1. This ratio gives nearly the same results for impregnated and coprecipitated samples with 5 wt% Ni loading. A comparison between samples contain- ing 10 and 15 wt% Ni shows that a better distribution of Ni particles is obtained on coprecipitated samples, despite the availability of smaller surface area per metal atom as indicated by the higher (MSA/TSA) ratios. This is another indication of the structural A.E. Aksoylu, Z.I. Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 5 difference between coprecipitated and impregnated samples. 3.2. CO hydrogenation The hydrocarbon productivities obtained from CO hydrogenation experiments conducted at H2/CO ratios of 2 and 1/2 are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respec- tively. The largest hydrocarbon product size obtained is C4, and total production includes CI-C4 hydrocar- bons. A higher production level is obtained on copre- cipitated samples which parallels the higher MSA values reported in Table 1. It has been proposed in the literature that catalyst activity increases with increasing heats of adsorption for CO, and this is inversely related to the metal particle diameter ~p, 3hred ~M45 l __-'-c' 16h red / 0 5 10 15 20 Ni wt% Fig. 1.

The homogeneous distribution of Ni on coprecipitated samples and their higher MSA are thought to lead to smaller metal particle diameters and hence higher hydrocarbon production levels Figs. 3 and 4 show the C2-C4 selectivities obtained on impregnated and coprecipitated catalyst samples using H2/CO ratios of 2 and 1/2, respectively. For coprecipitated samples reduced for 3 h, the C2-C4 selectivity obtained at H2/CO=2 (Fig. 3) is about 25% on the 5 wt% Ni catalyst while it reaches 36% on the 11 wt% Ni sample followed by a slight decrease as the Ni loading is increased to 16.5 wt%. The A.E. Aksoylu, ZI. Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 7 coprecipitated samples reduced for 16h all give higher C2-C4 selectivity (above 30%) despite their high methanation activity. It is also to be noted that the C2-C4 selectivity of the coprecipitated 5 wt% Ni catalyst reduced for 16 h is much higher than the sample reduced for 3 h. The reason for this is likely to be the relatively higher MSA and hence activity of these samples not only for methanation but also for polymerization. Under the same reaction conditions, C2-C4 selectivity of the impregnated samples shows an almost linear relation with metal content, but it remains less than that for coprecipitated samples except at the highest Ni loading that was tested. When the CO concentration in the feed is increased the C2-C4 selectivities of both impregnated and copre- cipitated samples are higher (Fig. 4). Impregnated samples start with their highest selectivity at a loading of 5 wt% Ni followed by a small decrease at 10 wt% Ni and at 15 wt% Ni, while on coprecipitated catalyst samples the C2-C4 selectivity is enhanced with increasing Ni loading. Again the C2-C4 selectivities obtained with samples reduced for 16 h are higher than those of samples reduced for 3 h. These results indi- cate that, due to their relatively low activity, impreg- nated catalysts lack the carbon polymerization ability to produce larger hydrocarbons which results in low C2-C4 selectivities despite their low methanation activity. The highest C2-C4 selectivities are observed on coprecipitated samples reduced for 16 h which have the highest polymerization ability at low Hz/CO ratios in the feed. However, if the olefin to paraffin ratios of the C2-C3 hydrocarbons are considered, the olefin selectivities of impregnated samples are found to be drastically higher than those of coprecipitated catalysts which is due to their lower hydrogenation activity. Figs. 5 and 6 show the variation in this ratio with metal loading for catalysts prepared by both methods at two different Hz/CO ratios. The trends show that the hydrogenation ability increases with increasing Ni content, and this leads to the hydrogenation of olefinic products to paraffins. It should also be noted that the difference between impregnated and copreci- pitated samples decreases as Ni content increases. Coprecipitated catalysts are clearly better for the production of paraffins. The specific activities of the catalysts, i.e. the total hydrocarbon production per MSA, have also been compared for both H2/CO=2 and H2/CO=1/2 (Table 2). In both cases, when coprecipitated samples reduced for 3 and 16 h are compared, the results clearly show that the reduction time does not cause 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 u 0.20 0.10 0.00 0 20 ---o- imp, 3h red ~ cl 31h6hreded 5 10 15 Ni wt% Fig. 5.

Among both 3 h reduced and 16 h reduced coprecipitated samples, 5 wt% Ni loaded ones have the highest specific activity level, and specific activity decreases as the Ni loading is increased from 5 to 10 wt%. Similar specific activity trends have previously been reported for CO2 methanation over coprecipitated Ni/A1203 where it has been shown that the specific activities of 11 and 16.5 wt% Ni/AI203 may be close to each other but further increase in Ni content (i.e. 25 wt% Ni) clearly suppresses the CH4 production per MSA [6]. The specific activities of impregnated sam- ples increase with increasing Ni content for both H2/CO=2 and H2/CO=1/2. The specific activities of the samples prepared by different methods show different trends; i.e. with A.E. Aksoylu, ZI. Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 9 coprecipitated samples, the specific activity shows a decreasing trend as the metal loading increases whereas for impregnated samples it increases with increasing metal content. The specific activity of the coprecipitated 5 wt% Ni samples is comparable to that of the impregnated 15 wt% Ni sample. The spillover of CO adsorbed on reduced Ni to A1203 to form methoxy species and reverse spillover from the A1203 support to Ni to form CO and C have been observed in TPR experiments [ 14]. The spillover/ reverse spillover effect in coprecipitated Ni/A1203 catalysts has been confirmed in a previous paper using CO as well as CO2 adsorption and CO2 methanation [6]. The specific activity increase for Ni/A1203 cata- lysts may be attributed to the spillover/reverse spil- lover mechanism between the metal and the support. The changes in specific activities (i.e. total hydrocar- bon production per unit metal surface area) observed in the present work indicate that this mechanism is enhanced by the increase in the metal content of samples prepared by impregnation, while it loses its importance for coprecipitated samples as the metal content increases. Although geometric properties such as porosity play a prominent role in the selectivity of FT synthesis, this effect becomes important when higher degrees of polymerization resulting in high molecular weight hydrocarbons are involved. Since C1-C3 hydrocarbons constitute the majority of the product obtained in this work, and C4 hydrocarbons are produced in very small quantities, the effect of porosity on selectivity has not been taken into con- sideration. 3.3. CO2 hydrogenation CO2 hydrogenation has not been investigated as much as CO hydrogenation. The CO2 methanation activity of coprecipitated samples is much higher than that of impregnated ones, as in the case of CO hydrogenation (Fig. 7). In CO2 hydrogenation, nearly all the hydrocarbon product is methane in both cases. When specific activities are considered (Table 2), a comparison similar to the case of CO hydrogenation can be made between coprecipitated and impregnated samples. The specific activity of coprecipitated sam- ples decreases as the metal content increases whereas for impregnated samples it increases with metal loading. The possible reason for the higher activity obtained in CO2 hydrogenation compared to CO hydrogenation may be explained as follows: in CO hydrogenation, the presence of carbon species on the catalyst surface 6 ~ 5 O 0 0 5 10 15 20 imp, 3h red Ni wt% Fig. 7.

Although a very small amount of ethane is also produced, it is negligible compared to the amount of methane. Another important product of this reaction is CO, and it is appropriate that CO production per CH4 produced be considered as another performance cri- terion for these catalysts (Fig. 8). As the Ni content of the catalyst sample increases the (CO produced/CH4 produced) ratio drops below 0.10 for catalysts pre- pared by either method. This ratio is smaller for coprecipitated samples even at low Ni contents, which can be explained by the higher level of interaction between metal and support that tends to be even stronger at low metal contents. The high level of interaction probably leads to the use of an alternative carbon source in the reaction on active Ni particles, and this can be explained by the spillover-reverse spillover phenomena discussed in a previous paper [6]. The same conclusion can be reached especially for samples with low metal loading by looking at the production levels obtained in CO hydrogenation and the corresponding MSA values of the samples, which is in agreement with literature [26,27]. 4. Conclusions This work consists of CO and CO2 hydrogenation data taken by using a range of Ni/A1203 catalysts prepared by coprecipitation and impregnation under the same set of reaction conditions, which makes it possible to compare them on the basis of metal content and preparation method. The conclusions that can be drawn are as follows: (i) Structuralproperties. In coprecipitated catalysts, Ni is distributed homogeneously throughout the solid structure and metal/support interaction is nearly com- plete in the oxide form. Consequently, the additional metal does not lead to losses in TSA and TPV, and the MSA of coprecipitated catalysts are higher than impregnated ones with similar metal content. (ii) CO hydrogenation. The high level of metal/ support interaction and high MSA lead to higher hydrocarbon production levels on coprecipitated cat- alysts as compared to impregnated catalysts with similar Ni content. The olefin/paraffin ratios for C2-C3 hydrocarbons are better for impregnated catalysts due to their relatively low hydrogenation ability, while the high polymerization and hydrogenation ability of coprecipitated samples leads to better C2-C4 selectiv- ities with increased paraffin production. The reduction time does not affect the specifc activities of copreci- pitated samples but enhances their MSA and hence A.E. Aksoylu, ZL Onsan/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 1-11 11 total hydrocarbon production levels. The specific activity of coprecipitated samples decreases with increasing metal content, but the relation is reversed for the impregnated samples. The increase in specific activities can be explained with the spillover/reverse spillover between the metal and the support. Results indicate that this mechanism is plausible at low metal loadings for coprecipitated catalysts and at high metal loadings for impregnated ones. (iii) C02 hydrogenation. Coprecipitated catalysts are better compared to impregnated ones in terms of higher CO2 methanation activity and lower CO pro- duction per mole of methane produced. The relation between specific activity and metal loading for both impregnated and coprecipitated samples is the same as in CO hydrogenation. Acknowledgements The authors thank Prof. David L.
