Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate School of Science and Technology Kumamoto University 2-39-1 Kurokami, Chuo Kumamoto 860-8555 Japan Ru/Al2O3 is an active catalyst for the stoichiometric NO–CO–C3H6–O2 reaction, whereas >90% of the loaded Ru was volatized during thermal ageing in airflow at 1000°C for 100h, resulting in considerable catalyst deactivation. Using α-Fe2O3 as support, the Ru volatilization was suppressed to a significant extent, because Ru oxide was stabilized by dissolving into Fe2O3 to form a solid solution. Nevertheless, this metal-support interaction decreased the Ru concentration on the catalyst surface, thus leading to another catalyst deactivation route. The catalytic activity can be regenerated by applying H2-reduction treatment to the aged Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst. Graphical abstract Image 2 Keywords Ruthenium Volatilization Iron oxide Catalyst deactivation Three-way catalyst 1 Introduction Among the platinum-group metals, Rh, Pd, and Pt have been used as main catalyst components in three-way catalysis (TWC), ever since this state-of-the art technology was first commercialized in 1978 [1–5]. In the early stage of research development, Ru catalysts were also considered as potentially active components because of their high catalytic activities toward NO conversion [6–10]. The most prominent feature of Ru catalysts is that they convert NO selectively to N2 under rich conditions at low temperatures (≤500°C), whereas the other platinum-group metal catalysts convert NO to NH3 [6–10]. The Ru activity has also been confirmed for NO–CO and NO decomposition reactions [9,11–13]. Nevertheless, Ru has not demonstrated sufficient durability, because it readily produced volatile and toxic oxides (RuO4 and/or RuO3) upon exposure to a high-temperature oxidizing atmosphere [14]. An engine dynamometer test under real exhaust conditions showed rapid deactivation; the Ru content in a converter was reduced down to 25% of its initial value after 50h [15]. A few studies claimed that Ru could be stabilized with respect to RuO4 formation in an oxidizing atmosphere [10,14,16–20]. Basic oxides containing alkaline earth and rare earth elements stabilize Ru by forming ruthenates, which have a small tendency to volatilize [17]. Therefore, several perovskite-type ruthenates (SrRuO3 and BaRuO3) and their related oxides were studied as catalysts for NO–CO and NO–CO–H2 reactions [19–22]. Magnesium oxide was also reported to be effective in suppressing the Ru vaporization loss [18]. These attempts appeared to be successful in both engine dynamometers and vehicle conditions studies, but failed in practical application, probably because of their lower catalytic performance. The development of thermostable Ru catalysts without compromising the performance of emissions control is still challenging from the viewpoint of materials. In the present study, we attempt to develop a novel Ru catalyst to suppress the volatilization during thermal ageing under an oxidizing atmosphere. Focusing on the interactions with various support materials, which contribute to both stability against volatilization and catalytic activity, we propose iron oxide (Fe2O3) as a useful support material for thermostable Ru catalysts. Because the thermal ageing test shows a significant suppression of the volatilization loss, the local structure of Rh/Fe2O3 is investigated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to elucidate the stabilization mechanism. The simulated TWC reaction is performed before and after thermal ageing, in order to correlate stability with catalytic activity. 2 Experimental procedure 2.1 Catalyst preparation and characterization Supported Ru catalysts (0.4wt% loading) were prepared via impregnation of an aqueous solution of Ru(NO3)3 followed by air-drying at 100°C and calcination at 600°C for 3h. Various metal oxides, including α-Fe2O3 (Wako Chemical), γ-Al2O3 (supplied by Catalysis Society of Japan) and several carbonates such as CaCO3 (Kishida Chemical) were used as supports. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (S BET) of these materials are <10m2 g−1 except for γ-Al2O3 (150m2 g−1). The as-prepared catalysts (0.5g) were thermally aged at 1000°C for 100h in an airflow supplied at F =50cm3 min−1 in order to evaluate the extent of Ru loss via volatilization under an oxidizing atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (30kV, 20mA, Multiflex, Rigaku), and the Ru content was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXL300, Rigaku). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-alpha spectrometer under Al Kα radiation (12kV). N2 adsorption isotherms were obtained at −196°C (Belsorp-mini, Microtrak-Bel) to calculate S BET values. The temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR) of the supported Ru catalysts was conducted in a flow system. After the catalysts were treated in a 20vol%-O2 flow balanced with He at 400°C for 30min, they were heated from room temperature to 700°C in a 5vol%-H2 flow balanced with He at a rate of 10°Cmin−1. The concentration of H2 in the effluent gas was analyzed using an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (GSD30101, Pfeiffer). Thermodynamic calculations for equilibrium vapor pressure of Ru oxides as a function of oxygen pressure were performed using a commercially available software (HSC Chemistry®, Outokumpu Research Oy). The local structure around Ru in the catalysts was investigated via Ru K-edge EXAFS, which was recorded on an NW10A station at the Photon Factory Advanced Ring of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization using a Si(311) double-crystal monochromator. The spectra were recorded at room temperature in transmission mode. The Ru loading for these analyses was increased to 2wt% in order to ensure the spectral quality. The obtained XAFS data were processed using the REX 2000 program (Rigaku). EXAFS oscillations were extracted by fitting a cubic spline function through the post edge region. The k 3-weighted EXAFS oscillations in the 30–140nm−1 region were then Fourier-transformed. For the curve-fitting analysis, the phase shifts and backscattering amplitude functions of the Ru–O and Ru–O–Ru shells were extracted from the EXAFS data obtained for RuO2. 2.2 Catalyst performance testing Catalytic tests were performed in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Each catalyst (W =50mg, 10–20mesh) was fixed in a quartz tube (4mm inside diameter) using quartz wool at both ends of the catalyst bed. The temperature dependence of the catalytic activity was evaluated by heating the catalyst bed from room temperature to 600°C at a constant rate of 10°Cmin−1, while supplying a simulated exhaust gas mixture containing NO (0.050vol%), CO (0.510vol%), C3H6 (0.039vol%), O2 (0.400vol%), H2O (5vol%), and He (balance) at F =100cm3 min−1 (W/F =5.0×10−4 gmincm−3). This gas composition corresponds to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio (A/F=14.6). The effluent gas was analyzed using a mass spectrometer (GSD30101, Pfeiffer) and non-dispersive infrared gas analyzers (VA3000, Horiba). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Ru loss via volatilization during thermal ageing Thermodynamic calculations imply that RuO2 is stable as a solid phase at 1000°C in air. However, in the gas phase, several oxide species such as RuO4, RuO3, RuO2, and RuO appear (see Supplementary data, Fig. S1). Assuming that RuO3 (p =5×10−5 bar) and RuO4 (p =2×10−5 bar) are the two dominant species and their calculated equilibrium pressures at 1000°C in air, Ru loss under the present thermal ageing condition reaches 100% within approximately 2h by assuming that equilibrium is achieved instantly with the flowing gas at a particular flow rate and that the loss simply reflects the equilibrium concentration in the volume of gas passed through the catalyst in the given time. Fig. 1 shows the percentage loss of Ru from various supported catalysts (0.4wt% Ru loading) during thermal ageing at 1000°C for 100h in an airflow. >90% of the Ru loaded on Al2O3 is lost in the airflow, whereas no such volatilizing loss occurs in a flow of He. The thermal ageing leads to the phase transformation of γ-Al2O3 into mixtures of θ- and α-Al2O3. Similar Ru volatilization is obtained for other typical oxide supports, such as ZrO2 and CeO2. By contrast, stability under air condition is improved when Ru is loaded on Fe2O3, Pr6O11, La2O3, CaCO3, and other alkaline-earth carbonates (not shown). Among the studied support materials in Fig. 1, the S BET value after thermal ageing is highest for Al2O3 (43m2 g−1), whereas the values for other materials are <10m2 g−1. The loss of surface area, however, is not a likely explanation for the observed stabilization effect. The stabilizing effect of basic solids containing rare earth and alkaline earth elements is associated with the formation of ruthenates, such as LaRuO3 and BaRuO3 [16,17]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the high stability of Ru oxide loaded on Fe2O3 and the formation of Fe–Ru binary oxides have not been reported previously. The present study is therefore focused on the Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst to elucidate the reason for the suppression of Ru volatilization. 3.2 Structure of stabilized Ru species XRD patterns of Ru/Fe2O3 before and after thermal ageing at 1000°C for 100h showed that no detectable change occurred during thermal ageing (see Supplementary data, Fig. S2). No obvious peaks due to supported Ru were observed because of the small loading (0.4wt% Ru). Fig. 2 shows the Fourier transforms of the Ru K-edge EXAFS for as-prepared and thermally aged Ru/Fe2O3 without phase shift corrections. The results for Ru/La2O3 and Ru/Pr6O11 after thermal ageing and RuO2 are also shown for reference. The observed peaks shift to shorter values with respect to the true atomic distances (r), as listed in Table 1 . The as-prepared Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst, calcined at 600°C, shows the first and second coordination shell peaks similar to those of RuO2; r and CN values close to those of RuO2 strongly suggest the presence of RuO2. Ru in thermally aged supported catalysts also exists in its oxide form, since an intense peak at approximately 2.0Å in all of these samples is attributed to an Rh–O shell. However, the second shell peaks of thermally aged catalysts are different from those of RuO2, suggesting that interactions at the metal-support interface must be taken into consideration. For Ru/La2O3 and Ru/Pr6O11, the second shell peaks are attributed to Ru–O–La and Ru–O–Pr, respectively, the r values of which are close to those in LaRuO3 and PrRuO3 [23]. On the other hand, thermally aged Ru/Fe2O3 exhibits an Rh–O shell with a larger r value (2.07Å), while its coordination number (CN=6.2) is similar to those of the other samples. The second shell peaks at r =2.91 (CN=2.3), 3.39 (2.3), and 3.77Å (3.9) are very close to those of Fe–O, with r =1.94 and 2.11Å (CN=6), and Fe–O–Fe, with r =2.90 (CN=1), 2.96 (3), 3.36 (3), and 3.70Å (6) in α-Fe2O3 [24]. Ru is therefore considered to dissolve into the Fe2O3 structure. Because the fresh Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst as calcined at 600°C shows no such interactions with Fe2O3 (Fig. 2 and Table 1), the reaction is considered to occur during thermal ageing at 1000°C. Notably, no solid solutions and binary oxides have been previously reported in the Fe–Ru–O system. These results demonstrate that the chemical fixation of Ru species via solid solution formation is able to suppress the volatilization loss of Ru catalysts under a high-temperature oxidizing atmosphere efficiently. The interfacial bonding of Ru oxide is previously reported for Ru/CeO2 [25]. The formation of Ru–O–Ce interfacial bond after calcination in air leads to self-dispersion through conversion of large Ru oxide particles to smaller nanoparticles. This phenomenon results in significant enhancement of the catalytic activity for CO oxidation, when the catalyst is reduced by H2. However, the results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that such interfacial bonding is not sufficient to suppress the volatilization loss of the Ru oxide during thermal ageing at 1000°C for 100h. The dissolution of Ru into the bulk structure of Fe2O3 should be a key to the present stabilization effect. 3.3 Catalytic deactivation and regeneration Figs. 3 and 4 show the catalytic light-off of a simulated stoichiometric NO–CO–C3H6–O2 reaction over Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/Fe2O3. In contrast to a steep light-off at T ≥300°C of both as-prepared catalysts, significant deactivation occurs after thermal ageing at 1000°C. It should be noted that the deactivation mechanisms of Ru/Al2O3 and Ru/Fe2O3 are quite different, regardless of their similar deactivation behaviors. In case of Ru/Al2O3 (Fig. 3), Ru loss by volatilization is the main cause, as shown in Fig. 1, and thus deactivation is irreversible and inevitable, as long as the catalyst is used in the presence of O2. On the other hand, Ru/Fe2O3 preserves the Ru content during thermal ageing, whereas XPS analysis demonstrates significant decrease of the Ru concentration on the surface (see Fig. S3 in the Supplementary data). Ru is dissolved into the bulk structure of Fe2O3 and thus its surface concentration is too small to ensure the catalytic activity. This type of deactivation was also found when Ru was loaded on Pr6O11, La2O3, or CaCO3 (see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary data). To deposit Ru on the surface of Fe2O3 and thus to regenerate the catalytic activity, post-ageing reduction treatment using dilute H2 is attempted. Based on the results of the H2-TPR experiment, the reduction temperature is 300°C, which is just before the reduction of bulk Fe2O3 commences (see Fig. S5 in the Supplementary data). As shown in Fig. 4, the catalytic activity could be regenerated to a significant extent by the reduction treatment using 5vol% H2/He. The effect of this post-ageing treatment is sensitive to reduction temperature. For instance, excess reduction at >350°C leads to the irreversible conversion of Fe2O3 to metallic Fe, which is easily agglomerated into large grains, and therefore more significant deactivation. The ability to regenerate the catalyst by H2 treatment further evidences that the deactivation associated with the thermal ageing for 100h is not due to surface area loss and associated blocking of gas access to the Ru. The present results imply that the possible conversion between metallic Ru deposited on Fe2O3 under rich conditions and oxidic Ru dissolved in Fe2O3 under lean conditions and its potential use for the volatilization loss of Ru under TWC conditions with lean/rich perturbation. Compared to Ru/Fe2O3, ruthenates formed on rare earth oxides like La2O3 are much more difficult to reduce to metallic Ru and thus to regenerate the catalytic activity (see Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary data). Further investigations will be needed to enable the reversible regeneration of the aged Ru/Fe2O3 catalyst under real exhaust conditions. 4 Conclusion The volatilization loss of Ru catalyst under high-temperature oxidizing atmospheres could be suppressed through the interaction with Fe2O3. During thermal ageing at 1000°C for 100h under flowing air, Ru/Al2O3 lost >90% Ru, while Ru/Fe2O3 showed no indication of volatilization, because Ru oxide was dissolved into the structure of Fe2O3 to form a solid solution that had not been previously reported. Nevertheless, both aged Ru catalysts were deactivated to a similar extent in the simulated three-way catalysis. Although the RuOx–Fe2O3 solid solution could stabilize Ru against volatilization, its Ru concentration on the surface was very low. The reduction treatment under precisely controlled H2 concentrations is necessary to regenerate the aged Ru/Fe2O3.
