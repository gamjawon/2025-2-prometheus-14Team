Ide Health and Safety Executive, West George Street, Glasgow, UK In a year-long survey beginning on 1 June 1989, the Employment Medical Advisory Service received queries from careers officers about 162 individuals whose past or current health problems potentially affected their employability. Respiratory, neurological, 'other', sensory and orthopaedic diagnoses were most common (20, 20, 15, 13 and 12.5% respectively). Up to six months after the initial query, 37 (22.8%) were unemployed and 21 (13.0%) had either changed or lost jobs or training. In 13/21 instances (61.9%), health problems were alleged to be the reason for the change. The School Medical Service detected only 29 of these cases (17.9%). The main reasons for this low rate were: late age at diagnosis, failure to attend for examination, and correct decisions that no health problems existed. These results suggest that school leavers with health problems may not be best served by current arrangements, since they may either be unnecessarily restricted or exposed to hazards as a result of their job choice. Occup. Med. Vol. 45, 21-26, 1995 Workplace health and safety legislation in the United Kingdom dates back to the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of 1802. The requirements for adequate ventilation and regular limewashing of the walls of the apprentices' accommodation mark the first ofial expression of concern for the welfare of a very vulnerable section of the community - its youngest workers. The 1870 Education Act made elementary schooling compulsory, although a poor environment from conception onwards meant that varying degrees of handicap were common and interfered with the ability to benefit from education and appropriate work. These concerns were highlighted in reports by Booth, Rowntree and others' at the turn of the century and reached their peak when it was revealed that up to 40% of recruits who volunteered to fight in the Boer War (1899-1902) were rejected because of health problems-under-development, visual defects and heart disorders were the most common reasons for failure3. The Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration4 produced the 1907 Education Act, which led to the Schools Medical Service (SMS) in 1908. The SMS was to examine children regularly throughout their school lives in order to detect and take steps in the correction of remediable defects that might interfere Correspondence and reprint requests to: Dr C. W. Ide, Medical Suite, Strathclyde Fire Brigade Headquarters, Bothwell Road, Hamilton, ML3 OEA, UK. with the child's ability to gain the maximum benefit from appropriate education. Children who left school and went to work in premises subject to the various Factories Acts were also medically examined. Initially, this was to establish that they were `of the ordinary strength and appearance of a child exceeding nine years or other specified age' (Factories Act 1833). The aim of subsequent legislation was to assess the fitness of young persons for particular jobs, both on entry, and, if necessary, periodically thereafter. If the young person's health was being harmed by work, then the certifying surgeon was empowered to suspend the individual. In 1952, the Medical Research Council published a survey based on the experiences of 579 disabled young persons aged 15-21 years registered under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 and 408 young persons who had left schools for the physically handicapped between 1945 and 1948. All were from Glasgow5; the main categories of disease are shown in Table 2. Infectious disease-mainly tuberculosis and poliomyelitis - was the root cause of almost 221% of disabilities. Just over 2) of young persons seen under the Factories Act 1937 were given certificates of rejection', but the general improvement in health meant that, by 1971, only 784/318 473, ie less than 0.25, suffered this f7 ate . In over 60of the cases in 1971, the causes were either infestations or refractive errors, and since very 22 Occup. Med. Vol. 45, No. 1, 1995 few new health problems were discovered that were relevant to employability, the routine examinations were discontinued soon afterwards. Surveillance was confined to young persons whose work involved hazards already subject to legislation or if advice was sought by local authority careers officers. SMS staff see children several times during school life. The last occasion is usually during the penultimate year of compulsory schooling, ie when the child is 14.5-15.5 years old. Drawing on past records, information provided by the parent(s) and child, and findings at the examination, the doctor will complete a form Y9 if he believes that the pupil has a health problem that may have a significant adverse effect on their ability to compete in the `open' jobs market. Copies of this go to the child's GP, the local Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS) and the relevant careers office. The problems involved in transmitting confidential medical information are solved by couching advice in terms such as `In my opinion, this pupil may not be suitable for work involving...'. Where the disability is more severe, parental consent is obtained and the form Y10 is used. In the future, if the young person seeks the advice of the careers officer, then the careers officer will ask the young person whether they have any health problems and check whether the office has a Y9/ 10. Irrespective of the outcome, the careers officer may still feel that medical advice may be necessary and will contact EMAS. EMAS will then check its records of Y9s and may contact the GP, relevant specialist or even arrange to meet the young person and/or their parents, before reporting back to the careers officer. Despite receiving over 800 Y9/ l Os each year, very few of the cases referred to EMAS by the careers officer are covered by these forms, even though the health problems are sometimes severe and/or protracted. Are some young persons slipping through the net? This final SMS examination is an important one - it offers an unparallelled opportunity to catalogue health problems, since up to 27\"-of the total community burden of disability manifests itself before the age of 198. This survey had four objectives: (i) to assess the health problems affecting this group of school leavers; (ii) to assess what use the careers officers made of the local EMAS service; (iii) to determine the employment outcomes up to six months after the initial enquiry; and (iv) to find out what proportion of allegedly serious health problems had been detected by the SMS. The survey was set in Strathclyde region, one of the largest local authorities in Western Europe. In 1989, the population was 2 311200 9, ie nearly half of Scotland. about 342 200 were pupils in 1100 primary and secondary schools\". METHODS All referrals from the Strathclyde Regional Council Careers Service (CS) for the year beginning 1 June 1989 were initially included. On arrival of the request, details such as name, date of birth, referring careers officer, alleged health problem(s), and the presence or absence of a Y9/10 in the EMAS ofce were noted. On receipt of written consent, the GPs were contacted with a standardized letter, requesting details of the nature and duration of the problem(s), response to treatment, prognosis, any other observations that the GP felt relevant, and whether they had received any Y9/ 10 from the SMS. Any further queries were made by telephone. Up to six months after the initial enquiry, the relevant careers officer was contacted by letter and asked about the current employment status of the young person, whether there had been any job changes and whether the CS had received a Y9/10 from the SMS. The CS also provided information including the total number of school leavers, numbers known to have health problems etc. Finally, the SMS was asked about the contact that it had had with the young person at the final examination, and whether any Y9/10 had been issued. RESULTS The results are shown in Figure 1 and Tables 1-4. In total, 169 young persons entered the survey, and 162 (106 male, 65.4) were included in the final analysis.

All GPs who were approached cooperated. The careers officers only sought EMAS advice for about 0.66 of leavers during the year of the study. This is because their training syllabus equips them with a degree of knowledge of the implications for work of some disease problems. Also, many jobs will not require anything other than good general health, irrespective of how it is maintained, eg with long-term medication. Not all school leavers will contact the CS, and a lot of general advice is given by EMAS to both careers officers and young persons over the telephone, and is not the subject of a formal request. Table 1 describes, by sex, the body system affected more precisely, whether diagnosed before the 14th birthday, whether any organization had a Y9 from the SMS, and the numbers of young persons who failed to attend for examination. Table 2 compares the breakdown of major disabilities (expressed as percentages) between the 1952 and 1989/ 1990 cohorts. Tables 3 and 4 provide information about employment outcome, ie whether they had a job or not, whether they had to change careers, and, if so, whether this was because of health problems. Up to six months after entering the survey, 37/162 (22.80 of the total) were unemployed. Females (15/56, 26.8%) were worse off than males (22/106, 2O.8; in this respect. The disease categories associated with the highest rates of unemployment were eyes for the males (37.5- and orthopaedics for the females (75.0o). Table 1. Breakdown of health problems by sex and diagnosis DISCUSSION Health problems The two populations of disabled people described in the paper may not be completely comparable - the two subgroups comprising the MRC cohort in 1952 were larger and covered a wider age range compared with the age range of 14.9 - 17.5 years and median age of 16.0 years in this group at the time of enquiry. In addition, there was no mention of multiple health problems: the 987 subjects studied in 1952 had 987 diagnoses, and special schools were much more widely used. In this survey, although the principal diagnoses were very much the same as the 1952 cohort, they were ranked very differently (Table 2). No problems were attributed to either polio or tuberculosis. This is due to improvements in public health that have occurred over the decades. Employment outcomes The rates mentioned earlier may well be an underestimate of the degree of unemployment, since a proportion of those whose fate is unknown will also be jobless. This possibility is confirmed by figures which show that, for the 12 months ending in March 1990, 34.8% of disabled Youth Training Scheme (YTS) leavers in the survey area were unemployed, against 19.1 1 of the overall total YTS population (Department of Employment, personal communication).

The regio-irregularities, racemic placements and their succession, which are known to cause depression of the melting point of isotactic polypropene produced with homogeneous catalysts, were studied and compared. Only stereospecific 2,1-insertions were detectable and found to increase with temperature. 1,3-insertion shows up only for catalyst with tetrahydroindenyl ligands and replaces the 2,1-insertions at elevated polymerization temperatures. A racemic propene placement occurring after a 2,1-insertion sequence is found to a minor extent compared to regular meso enchainment.

Introduction The degree of stereocontrol and the physical properties of polymers produced with stereongid bridged homogeneous catalysts have been a point of much consideration. Compared with heterogeneous catalysts their polymers lack of lower melting points even so the homogeneous catalysts show a higher degree of stereospecifity in terms of isotacticity rates. The insertion of regio-irregular units has been claimed to be one of the reasons of this drawback [ 1,2] . In this paper five different indenyl catalysts were compared with respect to * Corresponding author. 1381-1169/95/$09.50 995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDI1381-1169(95)00066-6 the microstructure of the resulting polymers over a broad range of polymerization temperatures. Emphasis has been put on the polymerization temperature dependence of the occurring misinsertions. Such considerations can give valuable hints for the interpretation of the structure /reactivity relation. 2. Experimental The catalysts were prepared according to the literature [3,4]. Propene (quality 99.8%) was further purified while condensing it into the reactor by passing it through 10 molecular sieves 60 G. Schupfner, W. Kaminsky /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 102 (1995) 59-65 and BASF copper catalyst R3-11 columns at 80. The propene bulk polymerization was carried out in a dry steel reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The catalyst (10-6 to 10-g mol depending on polymerization temperature) and methylaluminoxane (MAO) 300 mg, both in toluene solution, were prereacted with each other at room temperature for 12 min in a lock and injected into the liquid propene with argon pressure. The polymerization was stopped after 100 min by x\\ \\ZrC12 X=CHZCHZ 1[et(1-indenyl)2]ZrC12 degassing. One polymerization series was complete after three repeated polymerization runs each at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60. The resulting polymer was stirred with a 5% hydrochloric acid/water/ 20% ethanol solution, washed with water/20% ethanol, neutralized and finally vacuum dried at 60.

Polymerization The following catalysts were used in propene bulk polymerization (Fig. 1). 61 The polymerization results are summarized in Table 1. By GPC polydispersities Mw/Mof 1.8 to 2.5 were found. In bulk polymerization molecular weights and melting points exceed those of solvents polymerization especially at higher Tp [ 6] . For example a polymerization using catalyst 2, at a Tp of 66 and 1.6 mol/1 propene results in a PP sample with a isotacticity index (II=(S~,+0.5Sr,)/(Sn,,S+S,)) of 81%, a melting point of 97 and a Mof 11000 g mol -' 3.2. Microstructure It is well known that besides heterotactic misinsertions at least one other type of regio-aspecific insertion occurs. In Table 2 are listed all observed and calculated shifts.

Mechanistic scheme rationalizing a potential pathway to 1,3-inserted propene units ( 8 ) initiated by a 2.1-insertion process (_1 -> _2 ). 1,3-Inserted propene can originate from a methyl-H Zr interaction (5) via a hydride shift (7) or alternatively (a) needs rotation and recoordination followed by 1,2-insertion of the terminal olefin of structure (6 ) into the Zr-H bond. In contrast the pathway via methylene-H participation is leading to an internal olefin causing chain termination. C(2) atom= 9. sered to be part of a regular O1-sequence. For the best fit of the calculation a 010101 unit was placed before and behind the sequence in question. A racemic insertion of the 2,1-inserted monomer as disclosed by others is not observed at all [9]. 30 A 2,1-insertion leaves the active site in a deactivated state for further olefin insertion and a preferred mode for chain termination by /3hydride elimination. One aim of this work was to study this deactivated catalyst state. 1,3-i 20 C J I . ~ 2,1 i 50 45 40 35 (PPm) 30 ?5 20 15 Fig. 2.

It is an open question if a terminal olefin and a Zr-H structure exist as intermediates (Scheme 1, _6) [10], staying in close proximity ready to coordinate and continue chain growth and not to cause chain transfer, when the olefin is leaving the coordination sphere. This type of insertion is called a 1,3-insertion and originates from a 2,1insertion. 4 2~ 00021; 0,003 00032 o,aoia ooo3s 00038 0004 1/T [ 1/K ] Fig. 4.

Variation of melting temperature Tm with TP for polypropene samples obtained with catalyst 3 =and 4= For bridged H4-indenyl catalysts the 2,1-insertion becomes the predominant type of regio-specific mistake at higher polymerization temperatures. At Tp = 60 one exclusively finds 1,3-insertion, while all the 2,1-insertions detectable at low polymerization temperatures ( - 20) have disappeared ( Fig. 2) . Bridged indenyl catalysts do not show any 1,3insertion at all, at least when bulk polymerization applied and therefore the monomer concentration is high. 2,1-Insertions are increasing with Tp. One is able to detect a racemic placement of the next 1,2-inserted olefin at higher polymerization 64 G. Schupfner, W.

However preferentially to about 70% 2,1-insertions are flanked by regular meso placement. In the case of a 2,1-insertion a stereocenter is built up in the a-position of the chain next to the zirconium atom. The mechanism responsible for enantiomorphic site control is said be predominant causing a 3 times higher rate of regular meso enchainment after a 2,1-insertion defect. Molecular weights were found to be higher for the H4-indenyl catalyst at low polymerization temperatures (Fig. 3) but decrease more rapidly with Tp compared to the indenyl catalyst, which can be expressed in higher rates of /3-hydride elimination for the H4-indenyl catalyst. As already shown the same tendency to stronger /3-hydride agostic interaction causing the 1,3-insertion on one site is responsible for elimination by ydride transfer causing chain transfer and there- fore lowering the molecular weight at elevated temperatures. In a logarithmic diagram M,, against T -1 a steeper slope of the Arrhenius equation can be taken as a measure for an increased temperature dependent tendency to /3-hydride elimination compared to chain growth (Fig. 4). Comparing the degree of melting point reduction caused by the different irregularities the 1,3insertion reduces crystallinity to a lesser extent than the 2,1-insertions when polymer samples of the same Tp and mmmm %o pentad concentration are compared (Table 1 and Fig. 5) . 3.3. Ethene propene copolymers with very low ethene contents Polymers with very low ethene contents ( < 3 mol%) were found to have 2 times higher molecular weights while their melting points are only slightly lower. To study this phenomenon emphasis was placed on the microstructure of the polymer [ 11 ] (Table 3) . The insertions that were found are listed in Table 4. By NMR it can be proved that almost 3/4 of the occurring 2,1-insertions are followed by an Table 4 Observed and calculated \"C NMR shifts for ethene-propene copolymers + =peak is overlapping with one of the main peaks 2,1-i 2,1-e-i sequence calculated (ppm) observed (ppm) e-i 2,1 insertion 0101 see Table 2 2,1-insertion followed by ethene insertion O1 0010 O1 1 (S) 2 (T) 45.65 31.32 45.5 31.0 ethene insertion 0101 3 (P) 4 (S) 5 (S) 6 (T) 7 (P) 8 (S) 9 (S) 10 (T) 11 (P) 20.99 34.79 34.49 33.98 20.31 34.49 34.79 31.32 20.99 + 34.6 34.3 33.8 20.1 34.3 34.6 31.0 + sequence 1 (S) 2 (T) 3 (P) 4 (S) 5 (S) 6 (S) 7 (T) 8 (P) calculated (ppm) 45.95 31.00 20.88 37.73 24.51 37.73 31.00 20.88 observed (ppm) + 30.7 20.8 37.6 24.3 37.6 30.7 20.8 G.

Conclusions Propene bulk polymerization leads to a higher degree of stereocontrol especially at elevated polymerization temperatures compared to solution polymerization, which is reflected in higher melting points of the resulting polymer samples. The 2,1-insertion leads to hydride elimination and chain growth termination. One way to overcome this is to incorporate ethene as a comonomer to activate the catalysts sites blocked by 2,1-insertion. The resulting polymers have two times higher molecular weights. Indenyl and H4-indenyl ligands produce polymers of different stereochemistry. 2,1-Insertion is found for all catalysts. At higher polymerization temperatures the H4-indenyl catalyst can or has to overcome the hindrance to chain growth by a 2,1insertion via a hydride shift initiated transformation of the Zr-chain bond (Scheme 1, _5), which leads to a 1,3-insertion. No 2,1-insertions are detectable any more. The indenyl-catalysts however simply produce more 2,1-insertions with increasing TP. A racemic propene insertion after a 2,1-insertion becomes more probable for Tp's of 60 but is still - due to predominantly enantio- 65 morphic site control - of minor occurrence as compared to a regular meso enchainment. The last effect can best be explained electronically. The metal center of the H4-indenyl catalyst system must to be of a stronger cationic nature therefore favoring the hydride agostic interaction. At elevated temperatures side reactions with participation of hydride agostic interaction become noticeable leading to either 1,3-insertions or chain transfer which is reflected in lower molecular weights of the obtained polymer.

Propene bulk polymerization with rac-ethylenebis (1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride, ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride, dimethylsilylbis (1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride, dimethylsilylbis (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride/methylaluminoxane (MAO) were carried out at polymerization temperatures from 0 to 60°C. The regio-irregularities, racemic placements and their succession, which are known to cause depression of the melting point of isotactic polypropene produced with homogeneous catalysts, were studied and compared. Only stereospecific 2,1-insertions were detectable and found to increase with temperature. 1,3-insertion shows up only for catalyst with tetrahydroindenyl ligands and replaces the 2,1-insertions at elevated polymerization temperatures.
