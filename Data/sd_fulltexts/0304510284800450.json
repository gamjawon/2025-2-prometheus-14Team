C. HUGHES, JOHN 0. H. NEWMAN National Coal Board, Coal Research Establishment, Stoke Orchard, Cheltenham, GL52 4RZ (U.K.) and GEOFFREY C. BOND Department of Chemistry, Brunei University, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH (U.K.) Summary Catalysts derived from Fe3(CO)i2 supported on ^-Al^O^ have been found to give very high selectivities (> 90%) to low molecular weight alkenes from H^-CO mixtures. The activities and catalyst lifetimes are, however, relatively low. The addition of Pt to these catalysts, both as a conventional promoter and on separate A^Oa particles, increases the activity significantly while retaining a high selectivity to C3-Ce alkenes. The levels of CKU produc- tion and analytical data indicate a partial covering of the Pt surface by Fe in both cases; the increased activity suggests a spillover of H atoms from the Pt to the Fe surface and an increase in the rate of hydrogenation of surface- bonded alkenic intermediates. Introduction One route from coal to chemical feedstocks involves gasification of the coal followed by the catalytic conversion of the resultant CO-H2 mixture (synthesis gas) to hydrocarbon and oxygenated chemicals. While synthesis gas may be selectively converted into Ci chemicals such as CH4 [1] or CH30H [2], many other reactions are non-selective and yield a wide range of products. Recent interest in Fischer-Tropsch chemistry [3, 4] has focussed on improving the selectivity of catalysts for the production of industrial chemicals such as higher alcohols and low molecular weight alkenes. Parallel studies of the 'heterogenisation' of homogeneous catalysts have led to the development of supported metal cluster compounds which, in the case of many metal carbonyls, may be converted into highly dispersed, sup- ported metals. This class of catalyst has intriguing selectivities for the conver- sion of synthesis gas [5 - 7]; in particular, catalysts formed from Fe3(CO)i2 are highly selective for the formation of low molecular weight alkenes from synthesis gas [8], although catalytic activity declines dramatically with time 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 220 on stream. This deactivation has been attributed to sintering of very small metal particles [8]. Carbon deposition is another possibility. Consequently, increasing the concentration of H atoms on the Fe surface may inhibit carbon growth and aid maintenance of catalytic activity. Such an increase might be achieved via spillover from a metal which will readily dissociate H-^ molecules but is relatively inactive in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. In the present study, the effect of Pt on the activity and product distri- butions of catalysts formed from Fe3(CO)i2 supported on 7^203 has been investigated using both bimetallic and physically mixed Fe Pt systems. Experimental Support preparation Actal 7-A1203 granules (4 - 8 mm, ~300 m2 g~1), crushed and sieved between 250 and 500 microns, were used as the support in all cases. The supports were initially dried in air at 473 K for 4 h. Platinised A^O^ cata- lysts (Pt/Al203) were prepared by impregnation of the 7^203 with the appropriate amount of platinum pentane 2,4-dionate dissolved in tetra- hydrofuran (~ 10 g 1~1), rotary evaporation to dryness and subsequent reduc- tion at 673 K under 1 bar of flowing H2 for 4 h. Catalysts with loadings of 0.8, 2.4 and 7.1 wt.% Pt were prepared. Catalyst preparation Catalysts containing 0.7 - 2 wt.% Fe were prepared by the suspension of the support in acetone solutions of Fe3(CO)i2, typically 2.4 g Fe3(CO)i2 in 0.25 1 of acetone for 50 g of support. A dry N2 atmosphere was used to prevent oxidation of the supported complex. The support was evacuated for several minutes and the green Fe3(CO)i2 solution admitted before atmo- spheric pressure was restored. The mixture stood for 16 h while the Fe3(CO)i2 became adsorbed as the red anionic complex [HFe3(CO)n]~ via reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups [9]. Excess solution was decanted and the red catalyst dried under vacuum at 313 K for 2 h, before being transferred to the reactor while still under a dry N2 atmosphere. Catalyst testing Catalysts were tested at 473 K under 10 bar of a 2:1 v/v H2:CO mixture at a gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV) of ~200 h\"1 in isothermal fixed bed reactors. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the apparatus. A con- stant flow of the H2-CO mixture (obtained from BOC Special Gases) was maintained by a Brooks thermal mass flow controller, and impurities such as metal carbonyls and high molecular weight hydrocarbons were removed by an activated carbon trap. The reactors (0.04 1 total volume, ~ 20 g catalyst) were heated in a fluidised sand bath to reaction temperature. CO conver- sions were < 5% to avoid heat build-up due to the exothermic reactions. The product stream was depressurised through a Tescom regulator and the liquid 221 VENT VENT VENT KEY: SURGE CHECK VALVES FLOW SENSORS @ FLOW CONTROLLERS PREHEAT COIL REACTORS ________ SHEATHED THERMOCOUPLES FLUIDISED SAND BATH PRESSURE REGULATOR HEATER LIQUID TRAP Fig. 1. Schematic of catalyst testing apparatus. products collected in a solid CO^-acetone cooled trap. The product gas was sampled at 30 - 60 min intervals, metered through a dry gas meter and vented to the atmosphere. Analysis Gas samples were analysed for Ci to Cg hydrocarbons, CO;, CO and H; using a Carle SX Series gas chromatograph with FID and TCD detectors. Liquid samples were diluted with known amounts of tetrahydrofuran and analysed for >Cs hydrocarbons and oxygenates on a Pye GVC gas chromatograph. Hydrocarbons were determined using a temperature-program- med ^263 column, while an isothermal (473 K) Porapak Q column was used to separate oxygenates. Fe and Pt contents of the catalysts were determined by atomic absorp- tion spectroscopy and gravimetry respectively. Results and discussion The effect ofPt addition to Fe^(CO)^ on A^Oa catalysts Fe catalyst Catalysts obtained by heating 7-Al203-supported Fe3(CO) 12 to reaction temperature gave initial carbon selectivities to + C^ alkenes of > 90% at CO conversions of ~ 0.2%. Although CO conversion decreased with time on stream, the selectivity remained high. Figure 2 shows the effect of time on stream on product distribution while Fig. 3 (lower line) plots % CO conver- sion against time on stream. The initial high selectivity to l-C^Hg decreased very rapidly as Cyfi^ became the major product.

Table 1 shows typical product distributions for both non-platinised and platinised Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 cata- lysts. The latter retain high selectivities towards + C^ alkenes, but CH4 and alkane formation are increased slightly due to increased hydrogenation activity. A blank experiment, using 0.8 wt.% Pt/A^O^ before treatment with Fe3(CO)i2, yielded CH4 as the major product, with only traces of C; hydro- carbons. The yield of CH4 was considerably higher than that obtained for the Fe3(CO)i2 on Pt/A^O^ catalyst, suggesting that the Pt surface was partially covered with Fe. Surprisingly, for both the Fe and Fe Pt catalysts, no products were detected. If C^ hydrocarbons are intermediates, then their absence may be explained by their rapid removal via a metallocyclobutane mechanism similar to that postulated by Hugues et al. [6]. 223 TABLE 1 A comparison of product distributions and activities of Fe3(CO)i; on \"y-Al^O^ and Fe3- (C0)i2 on Pt/Al^Oa catalysts Product % Carbon selectivity Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 Fe3(CO)i2/Pt/Al203 CH4 CaHo CaHg C4Hg CO, 1.2 88.9 trace 5.0 4.9 4.2 80.7 3.6 3.6 8.0 % CO conversion 0.24 0.9 Conditions: T = 473 K, P = 10 bar 2:1 H^CO v/v, GHSV - 200 h-1 at 2 h on stream, Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 = 1.3% Fe, Fe3(CO)i2/Pt/Al2C>3 = 0.7% Fe, 0.8% Pt.

The Fe content was ~2 wt.%. All catalysts gave high carbon selectivities (57 - 90%) to -06 alkenes and these were maintained during testing, although the CO conversion declined in the usual way. The level of CH4 production remained constant for any one catalyst over the 5 h test period, and was in the order of 1:1 > 3:1 > 9:1 Fe:Pt atomic ratio.

The effect of Fe:Pt atomic ratio on the activity of Fe3(CO)i2/Pt/Al2C>3 catalysts. 224 shows the variations of CO conversion with time on stream for the three catalysts. While the catalysts with Fe:Pt atomic ratios of 9:1 and 3:1 showed similar CO conversions, the 1:1 catalyst exhibited a substantially higher conversion. The 1:1 Fe:Pt atomic ratio catalyst also produced considerable proportions (up to 30%) of and Cg hydrocarbons (mainly alkenes). This suggests an increase either in the chain growth function or in the polymerisa- tion of alkenic intermediates. Physical mixtures of platinised Al-^O^ and Fe^(CO)^ on ^-Al-^O^ Physical mixtures of 0.8 wt.% Pt/Alpa and a 1.3 wt.% Fe, Fe3(CO)i2/ Al^O^ showed that specific activity (with respect to the amount of Fe) was strongly dependent on the proportion of Pt/Al203 present. Figure 5 shows the CO conversions after 2 h on stream for various mixtures of the two catalysts. For all the catalysts, selectivities to + C^ alkenes decreased from ~ 90 to ~ 75% during the first few hours on stream. Rates of CH4 formation were approximately constant, indicating a reaction mechanism (possibly methanation on the Pt/Al203) different than that of higher hydrocarbon formation. A comparative test using an Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 catalyst and the same catalyst diluted with untreated A1203 showed a constant activity with re- spect to the amount of Fe present. This indicates that the increase in activity with increasing proportions of Pt/Al203:Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 was due to the effect of Pt rather than to a change in GHSV relative to the amount of Fe catalyst. Since the Fe and Pt are not initially resident on the same A1203 par- ticles, a reactive species, transferable from one type of particle to another, must be involved. Further experiments have shown that the relative positions of Pt/Al203 and Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 within the reactor have a considerable effect on prod- uct distribution. Tests were performed using equal weights of 0.8% wt.% Pt/ Al^Oy and a 1.3 wt.% Fe, Fe3(CO)i2/Al203 catalyst in various configurations (one fully mixed and two as separate layers).

NA = not applicable. there is a considerable increase in + C^ alkene formation when the Pt/ A403 is downstream of the Fe catalyst. This increase is countered by a reduction in selectivity to CH4, although this selectivity is still considerably higher than that observed for the fully mixed system. Analysis showed (Table 2) that the Fe content of the Pt/Al203 (downstream configuration) increased from 0.03 wt.% Fe (as in the blank A^O^) to 0.23 wt.% Fe. These results suggest the vaporisation of Fe3(CO)i2 or some subcarbonyl species during thermal activation. Subsequent decomposition on the Pt surface would form, in effect, a bimetallic catalyst similar in structure to that obtained by the direct adsorption of Fe3(CO)i2 on Pt/Al203 from solution. These results, in conjunction with those for the 'conventionally' promoted catalysts, suggest a partial covering of the Pt surface with Fe. This may be responsible for the increased activity, since the Pt might increase the concentration of H atoms on the Fe surface via spillover and thus accelerate the hydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates. It follows that the increasing specific activity of the Fe with respect to the proportion of Pt present is due to increased interaction between the Fe and Pt. The strength of this depen- dence, for the physical mixtures, may be explained by the increased prob- ability of vaporised Fe3(CO)i2 contacting a Pt/Al203 particle as the propor- tion of Pt/Al203 is increased. In all cases, the model of a Pt surface partially covered with Fe is sup- ported by the experimental evidence. Further work on the characterisation of these catalysts should yield a deeper understanding of the promotional effect of Pt on this system. 226 Conclusions (1) Pt induces a marked increase in catalytic activity on Fe3(CO)i2/ A1203 catalysts while retaining a high selectivity to low molecular weight alkenes. (2) The increased activity is apparent for both 'conventionally' pro- moted and physically mixed catalysts. (3) The rate of catalyst deactivation is unaffected by the addition of Pt. (4) Fe3(CO)i2 is, to some extent, mobile under the reaction conditions. (5) Increasing the proportion of Pt in both 'conventionally' promoted and physically mixed catalysts increases the specific activity with respect to the amount of Fe present. (6) These phenomena suggest that a Pt surface partially covered with Fe is responsible for an increase in the rate of hydrogenation of surface-bound alkenic intermediates by the spillover of H atoms.
