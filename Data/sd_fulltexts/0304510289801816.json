In one of the two series of experiments studied, samples were reacted with ethylene at 200 C prior to further reaction with ethylene at room temperature. It was observed that the previously reported broad band at 2750cm\"1 arising from the hydrocarbon group connecting the living polymer to the chromium(II) site was split into two bands situated at 2768 and 2725 cm-1, respectively. These bands have been assigned to the asymmetric and symmet- ric stretching vibrations of the methylene group. Previous experiments had shown that CO adsorption onto the active chromium(II)-A polymerization site led to bands in the IR spectrum at 2176 and 2170cm-1 (the latter after 200 C/ethylene treatment) and which exhib- ited a shift from 2179 cm\" i for CO adsorbed on a chromium(II)-A surface species before reaction with ethylene. Similar shifts have now been observed with bands arising from CO adsorption on to chromium(II)-C surface species situated at 2187, 2181 and 2191 cm\"1, respectively. A model for polymerization initiation and for the mechanism of the polymerization reaction is proposed, which involves dinuclear surface species and explains several results obtained with the (reduced) Phillips catalyst. Introduction The Phillips catalyst (Cr^) on silica gel) [1] has been shown to be a much more complicated system than anticipated hitherto by most scientists, who have tried to unravel its mysteries. To date, six different chromium surface species with oxidation numbers of two and three have been identified in the reduced Phillips catalyst, of which four have been shown to be catalytically active (Table 1). In 1968, Krauss and Stach showed that after treatment with Og at temperature above 400 C, it is possible to reduce the activated Phillips 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands ro <N ^8 s s: a: 5 s a o> c- \" ^ 10 ^ f CD <f W 00 IN <0 00 i-< - < . s. + , + , + +A+ I + S-^ a?

These reduced samples polymerized ethylene at room temperature with no induction time and at a low ethylene pressure, while the Phillips catalyst exhibits an induction time (ofca. 30 min) at 100 C and requires an ethylene pressure of 3 mPa [5]. Krauss and Stach therefore concluded that chromium(II) on silica gel is the active species in the Phillips catalyst [2 - 4]. It was shown later that this chromium(II) surface species may be present either in a highly coordinatively unsaturated state involving only two oxygen ions from the silica gel as ligands [chromium(II)- A] [6 - 9] or coordinated to an additional surface silanol group [chrom- ium(II)-B] [6, 7] or a surface siloxane group [chromium(II)-C] [8, 9]. It is also possible for surface species to exist with two silanol or siloxane ligands derived from the silica gel surface [10,11]. It should be noted that the chromium(II)-C species notation used by the author is different from that employed by other workers [11,12] who did not distinguish between the above two species (B, C) and used the terminology chromium(II)-B for both (see ref. 13). The picture became more complicated when it was demonstrated that even chromium(III) can form catalytically active surface sites on silica gel [14 - 21], and that mononuclear as well as dinuclear chromium(II) and chrom- ium(III) surface species may be formed [8, 9,13,16,18, 21 - 25]. Although im- pregnation studies with chromic acid and chromyi chloride did not provide evidence for the existence of dinuclear chromium(VI) surface species [26 - 29], data from low-temperature CO (FT)IR spectroscopic investigations clearly showed that CO can be adsorbed on to the chromium(II) species as a bridging ligand and must therefore be adsorbed on dinuclear chromium(II) surface species. The present state of affairs as seen by the author is listed in Table 1, where the main polymerization site of the Phillips catalyst is given as the dinuclear chromium(II)-A surface species. The hydrocarbon group connecting the living polymer to the active chromium(II) surface site has been identified in the IR spectrum as exhibiting a C H stretching vibration at 2750 cm\"1 [31] which was assigned to a carbene group binding to the chromium. The present author later assigned this band to a methylene group which exhibited a deformation vibration at 1448 cm-1 [25]. However, virtually at the same time, other workers have assigned the latter band (but identified at 1450 cm\"1) to a carbene group [12]. The chromium(III) surface site is also connected to a methylene group, but with a C H stretching vibration at 2685 cm-1 and a deformation vibra- tion at 1447 cm~1 [21]. A weak shoulder at 2650 cm\"! was also noted in this case, but was not assigned. Adsorption of CO on the active chromium(II) site while the living polymer is still connected to the latter leads to a stretching vibration at 2170 or 2176 cm\"1 depending on the polymerization temperature [12,13, 23, 25]. The author has shown previously [16] that on reaction of a chrom- ium(II)/silica gel catalyst with ethylene at temperatures above 140 C, the 173 polymerization species formed is more active than after reaction with ethylene at lower temperatures. These two chromium(II) polymerization species are investigated here in greater detail. Experimental The experimental conditions have been described previously [25]. In short, self-supporting discs from silica gel 60 (Merck 7733) containing 0.5% Cr or 0.074% Cr, respectively, were heated in an IR cell to 800 C, and then treated with oxygen which was evacuated several times. Following this procedure, the chromium(VI) was reduced with CO at 350 C. The remaining CO was evacuated at 300 C and the initial IR spectrum of the sample recorded at room temperature (see Table 2; Series A, spectrum 1). The cell was again filled with CO (lOkPa) and the second and third spectra were recorded at room temperature and at 145 C (100 Pa CO), respectively. The cell was again evacuated at 300 C and cooled to 200 C. Ethylene [pressure, 42 kPa (0.5% Cr) or 210 kPa (0.074% Cr)] was now reacted with the catalyst for 15 s and then removed by treatment in vacua for 5 min at 200 C, following which the fourth spectrum was recorded at room temperature (Table 2; Series A, spectrum 4). It should be noted that the Series B sample exhibits no spectrum 4; in this case the sample was only evacuated at 300 C. Both samples were then allowed to react with ethylene at room temperature in a similar manner as previously at 200 C, although in the case of the 0.074% Cr sample the polymerization time was 2 min. After further evacuation at 20 C, a fifth spectrum was recorded and thereafter the IR cell again filled with 10 kPa CO and a sixth and seventh spectrum recorded at room temperature and 145 C, respectively. All the IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR spectrometer 20SXC with a resolution of 4cm~1 employing 4096-scan accumulation. A single spectrum required ca. 1 h to be fully recorded. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting one spectrum from another.

Spectrum 1 depicts the difference spectrum after reaction with ethylene at 200 C (Table 2; Series A, spectrum 4 minus spectrum 1) and has, in addition to two bands arising from methylene groups at 2927 and 2857 cm-1, a further two bands at 2964 and 2881 cm\"1 which may be attributed to methyl groups. After reaction of the same sample with ethylene at room temperature, additional polymer is formed which gives rise to spectrum 2 in Fig. 1 (Table 2; Series A, spectrum 5 minus spectrum 1). This additional polymer contains only methylene groups (absorption maxima at 2925 and 2853 cm\"1), as demonstrated in spectrum 3 obtained by subtracting spectrum 1 from spectrum 2 in Fig. 1. Reaction of ethylene with a 0.5% Cr/silica gel sample at room temperature without previous reaction of ethylene at high temperatures gives spectrum 4 in Fig. 1 (Table 2; Series A, spectrum 5 minus spectrum 1), but which has weaker bands although being otherwise quite similar to spectrum 3 in Fig. 1. Figure 2 depicts the same spectra as in Fig. 1 but over a different spectral region, i.e. that in which the deformation vibrations arising from methyl and methylene groups are observed. The deformation vibration from 'normal' methylene groups is observed at ca. 1465cm\"1 while that arising from methylene groups binding the living polymer to the chromium(II) site occurs at 1446 cm~1. The latter is absent from spectrum 1 and most prominent in spectrum 4. One of the two deformation vibrations arising from methyl groups is visible at ca. 1385 cm\"! in spectra 1 and 2, while the second occurs 3000 2900 2800 WAVENUMBERtcm-1) Fig. 1. FT-IR difference spectra for ethylene polymerization with a 0.5% Cr/silica gel sample.

Spectrum 4 was obtained after polymerization at room temperature only. 175 1600 1500 1400 WAVENUMBERlcm-1] Fig. 2. FT-IR difference spectra as in Fig. 1, but extending over the spectral region where the deformation vibrations arising from hydrocarbon groups are observed. at ca. 1466 cm\"1 but is masked by the deformation vibration arising from the methylene group. At a lower concentration of chromium in the catalyst (0.074% Cr), a much greater amount of polymer was formed at room temperature after high temperature reaction with ethylene, as demonstrated by spectra arising from the region between 3100 and 2700 cm\"1 (not depicted). Of greater interest are the spectra for the deformation vibrational region shown in Fig. 3 (0.074% Cr sample). Firstly, it should be noted that the band at 1446 cm\"1 arising from 1600 1500 1400 WAVENUMBERlcm-1! Fig. 3. Similar FT-IR difference spectra to those depicted in Fig. 2, but for the corresponding 0.074% Cr/silica gel sample. 176 the deformation vibration of the methylene group binding the living poly- mer to the active chromium site now has a much lower intensity. Secondly, the bands in spectrum 3 depicted in Fig. 3 are of much greater intensity than those in spectrum 4, indicating that ethylene treatment at 200 C increases the polymerization activity of the catalyst as observed previously [16]. Figure 4 depicts two difference spectra arising from 0.5% Cr samples after adsorption of CO on to the active polymerization site. In this figure, spectrum 1 is the difference spectrum constructed by subtracting the fifth spectrum for sample A in Table 2 away from the sixth spectrum for the same sample (reaction of ethylene at 200 C), while spectrum 2 is the difference spectrum for the same sample without reaction of ethylene at 200 C ob- tained by taking the fifth spectrum in Table 2 away from the sixth. Other scientists have observed previously [31] that the broad band at 2750 cm\"1 in the spectrum is that which is most affected by CO. This band is now narrower in Fig. 4 and is observed at 2768 cm-1 in both spectra. The very weak band at ca. 2725 cm\"1 is difficult to distinguish (arrow), but is interest- ing because it could arise from the symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene group binding the living polymer to the active chromium site. The band at 2768 cm\"! would then be assigned to the associated asymmetric stretching vibration. The two bands at 2768 and 2725 cm~1 were completely reproducible. Positive bands occur in both spectra at the normal positions for methylene stretching vibrations at 2921 and 2850 cm\"1 with additional bands in spectrum 1 at 2960, 2897 and 2877 cm\"!. These latter bands may be assigned to stretching vibrations from the methyl groups. Similar spectra to 3000 2900 2800 2700 2600 WAVENUMBERIcm-1) Fig. 4. FT-IR difference spectra for the 0.5% Cr/silica gel sample constructed from spectra recorded after polymerization at room temperature and addition of CO minus the spectra obtained after room temperature polymerization in the absence of CO. Spectrum 1 with ethylene treatment at 200 C and spectrum 2 without such treatment. 177 those in Fig. 4 were not observed with the 0.074% Cr sample which is not unexpected in view of the much lower number of active sites involved. An interesting detail in spectrum 2 is a negative band which occurs at 2995 cm\"1 together with a positive band located nearby at 2987 cm\"1. A band at 2998 cm-1 has been assigned previously to ethylene adsorbed on polymer- ization-inactive chromium(II) [25], because the turnover numbers of the catalytically active sites would be of the order of seconds and any ethylene adsorbed thereon would be polymerized [16]. The observed shift in spectrum 2 of Fig. 4 obviously arises from additional CO adsorption leading to the formation of a mixed CO/ethylene complex with chromium(II). Figure 5 illustrates the double difference spectra arising from CO adsorption on to active chromium polymerization sites while the living polymer is connected to the chromium. The first subtraction involved sub- tracting the second spectrum in Table 2 for sample A from the sixth spectrum for the same sample, while the second subtraction corresponded to subtract- ing the first spectrum and the spectrum of CO gas away from the second spectrum. The result of the second subtraction was then subtracted from that of the first by interactively adjusting the subtraction factor [i.e. spectra (6 2) k(2 1)]. Spectrum 1 in Fig. 5 arises from the 0.5% Cr/silica gel sample involving polymerization at room temperature after reaction with ethylene at 200 C while spectrum 2 is that in the absence of such treatment. Spectra 3 and 4 are similar to spectra 1 and 2 but arise from the 0.074% Cr sample (intensities x 7). A band associated with CO occurs at 2170 cm~1 together with a band at 2181 cm~1. The latter is sensitive to the subtraction 2180 2160 WAVENUMBERlcm-1) Fig. 5. Double difference FT-IR spectra (see text) arising from CO poisoning of the living chromium(II) polymerization sites. Spectrum 1 recorded with the 0.5% Cr/silica gel sample after treatment with ethylene at 200 C and polymerization at room temperature; spectrum 2 without ethylene treatment at 200 C. Spectra 3 and 4 are similar to spectra 1 and 2, but obtained with the 0.074% Cr/silica gel sample. 178 procedure and had previously been lost during the process of calculating double difference spectra. When the sample was only reacted with ethylene at room temperature, the band at 2175 cm~1 and a shoulder at 2185 cm\"1 were observed (spectrum 2 in Fig. 5). The band at ca. 2176 cm~1 has been observed previously [12,13,25]. Spectra 3 and 4 have been constructed in a similar manner to spectra 1 and 2 but now using the samples with a lower chromium concentration (0.07% Cr). Basically, they show the same features as the other two spectra, but the bands at 2181 cm\"1 (spectrum 3) and at 2187 cm-1 (spectrum 4) are now better resolved. The CO bands at 2181 and 2187 cm\" i could arise from the polymeriza- tion of ethylene and adsorption of CO onto a chromium(II)-C species, since a similar shift from a band at 2191 cm\"1 is observed as for the CO bands with the chromium(II)-A species which shift from an original value of 2179 cm~1 to bands at 2170 and 2176 cm\"1, respectively. The chromium(II)-C species can best be characterized by a band at ca. 2045 cm~1 in its low temperature spectra associated with bridging CO, while the chromium(II)-A species exhibits CO bands between 2035 and 2025 cm-1 [22]. Figure 6 illustrates the difference spectra arising from the adsorption of CO at low temperatures on chromium(II) sites subject to conversion by the polymerization reaction (i.e. the seventh spectrum minus the third). The three bands at 2120, 2100 and ca. 2035 cm\"! arise from the low-temperature triplet associated with bridging CO molecules [9,22,23]. That at ca. 2035cm\"1 is broad and is often split into several bands. The negative band observed at 2045 cm-1 belongs to the chromium(II)-C species [22], while the bands at 2035 and 2028 cm\" i may be assigned to subspecies of chromium(II)-A. Negative bands arising from those chromium(II) surface sites which have been converted by reaction with ethylene following thermal treatment 2200 2150 2100 2050 WAVENUMBERlcm-1) Fig. 6. Difference FT-IR spectra for CO adsorbed on to chrominm(II) surface species after polymerization minus those for CO adsorbed before polymerization. Notation of spectra as in Fig. 5. 179 at 200 C (spectra 1 and 3) are nearly twice as strong as for those not subjected to such treatment (spectra 2 and 4 in Fig. 6). This is in semi-quan- titative agreement with the spectra depicted in Fig. 5, where the integrated area of the CO bands shows a similar behaviour. The negative bands at ca. 2750 cm~1 in Fig. 4 also show the same trend as has been observed previously by the author [16]. As the chromium concentration in the silica gel decreased, an increase in the percentage of active sites present relative to the total number of all chromium surface sites was observed, in agreement with previous observa- tions [16, 32], and was characterized by negative bands at 2120, 2100 and ca. 2035cm\"1 in the spectra. In this respect it should be noted that although spectra 3 and 4 from the 0.074% Cr sample were multiplied by seven (the exact factor was 6.76), they are still approximately twice as strong as those from the 0.5% Cr sample (spectra 1 and 2, respectively). A similar trend was not observed with spectra arising from the poisoning of living polymerization sites with CO as depicted in Fig. 5. An explanation for this observation could be that because of the formation of large polymer molecules around each of the active sites present in the 0.074% Cr sample relative to the situation with the 0.5% Cr sample, a considerable number of the active sites in the 0.074% Cr sample may not be accessible to CO molecules. Discussion The splitting of the broad band at 2750 cm\"1 in the IR spectrum arising from the hydrocarbon group binding the living polymer to the active chrom- ium(II) site into two bands at 2768 and 2725 cm~1 as noted above may be due to either a hydrocarbon group on the chromium(II)-A and chromium(II)-C surface sites or to the two bands of the methylene group of the living polymer. Because of the existence of a methylene deformation band at 1446 cm-1 and of two bands at 2685 and 2650cm\"1 from methylene groups binding to chromium(III) sites, the latter possibility is favoured here. The splitting associated with the two methylene bands decreases from the normal value expected for methylene groups (2925-2853; 71cm\"1) to a value of 43cm~1 when binding occurs with chromium(II) to a value of 35cm~1 for binding with chromium(III), while the arithmetic mean value for the two methylene bands also decreases from 2887.5 to 2746.5 to 2667.5 cm\"!, respec- tively. There seems to be a connection between these two trends which can only be explained by assuming that they arise from a methylene group binding the polymer to the metal ion. The intensity ratio for the two methylene bands associated with linkage at chromium(II) and chromium(III) is higher than that for the methylene bands at 2925 and 2853 cm-1 depicted in Fig. 4. This suggests that the methylene group binding the living polymer to the chromium(II) and chrom- ium(III) sites is distorted from its normal tetrahedral configuration towards a square-planar arrangement. 180 The CO band at 2176 cm~1 has been assigned either to CO poisoning at the active chromium(II)-A polymerization site [13, 25] or to a mixed CO/ ethylene complex [12]. If both assignments are correct, this would mean that the electron densities of chromium(II) with one ethylene molecule or with one polymer chain attached are quite similar. This may be an important clue in unravelling the initiation mechanism. If the results reported above are taken together with those reported previously, it should be possible to explain them via a consistent model including several other features observed for the reduced Phillips catalyst: i. Polymerization initiation occurs solely through reaction of ethylene with active sites. ii. No other hydrocarbon groups besides methylene are formed in the initiation reaction. iii. Active chromium(II) and chromium(III) sites are paired (dinuclear). iv. Active chromium(II) sites rather than chromium(III) [16] form two different polymerization sites on reaction with ethylene at low and higher temperatures. v. The percentage of active polymerization sites relative to all chromium surface sites increases with decreasing chromium concentration (refs. 16 and 32, and results quoted above). c-/-'- T- -I'-- V ,0 ,/^/r ,C /Cr''H \\^-c\\^ - / ^-c^ \\0 0 ^k s '\"- ^ ^1\\ D 0 ^/ \\ ^c./ re i/ ^ ^&t'0 0 0 /k ^ ^ i ,Si\\ /\\\\ Scheme 1. Such a model is depicted in Scheme 1 which is based on previous schemes advanced by the author. Hydrogen atoms attached to the hydrocar- bon group have been omitted to enhance the clarity of the scheme. Structure 181 A shows a model of the dinuclear chromium(II)-A surface species with two ethylene molecules, which are already orientated so as to allow the initiation reaction to proceed. Structure B illustrates a possible route whereby the initiation step may occur at low temperatures, in which two ethylene molecules form a hydrocarbon bridge between two chromium atoms. This model conforms with the conditions i, ii and iii listed above. Reaction with ethylene at higher temperatures would involve a different process requiring the possible involvement of structure C in Scheme 1. Here two hydrocarbon bridges are formed between the two chromium atoms, again conforming to the conditions i, ii and iii. Whereas a CO molecule can be adsorbed at the chromium atom in structure B opposite the carbon atom of one polymer chain, it must occupy a different position in structure C opposite two polymer chains. This explains the lower stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on the active chromium sites after reaction with ethylene at higher temperatures (2170 instead of 2176 cm\"1). The existence of an additional ethylene molecule in structures D and E means that the latter will have to rotate through quite large and different angles in order to allow the formation of the transition complexes required by a cis-insertion mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Since the full angle of rotation for insertion by structure B is 180 while that for structure C is 135 , the latter should react more readily. This would explain why the polymerization species formed after reaction with ethylene at higher temperatures (structure C) exhibits a higher turnover number in the polymer- ization reaction [16]. The same argument may be applied to the dinuclear chromium(III) active site; in this case, it is not a second polymer chain which restricts the spatial arrangement of the ethylene molecule but the third oxygen ion. It has been observed that chromium(III) exhibits a similar high turnover number to that of chromium(II) after reaction with ethylene at high temperatures [16, 19]. The initiation reaction leading to structures B and C gives rise to chromium atoms with formal oxidation numbers of three (structure B) and four (structure C), respectively. If the same reactions occurred with chrom- ium(III), the formal oxidation numbers obtained would be four and five. The latter could be quite difficult to achieve and hence explain the observation listed under condition iv above. Condition v above may be explained in the following manner. To facilitate the initiation reactions, the active site needs sufficient space be- tween the two chromium atoms involved and this can be restricted by atoms from the silica gel support. This would explain why not all chromium(II)-A sites are polymerization-active. With a lower chromium concentration in the catalyst, chromium atoms might preferentially occupy those places on the silica gel surface that provide the most free space. This could explain why the percentage of active chromium sites increases with decreasing chromium concentration. The structures in the model presented above explain most of the experimental results obtained with the (reduced) Phillips catalyst and must 182 therefore have some bearing on the nature of the catalytic sites which exist therein.

S-221 00 LundSweden FT-IR spectroscopy has been employed to study two catalyst samples with O.5% Cr and O.074% Cr on silica gel in ethylene polymerization at room temperature and in the adsorption of CO. In one of the two series of experiments studied, samples were reacted with ethylene at 200 °C prior to further reaction with ethylene at room temperature. It was observed that the previously reported broad band at 2750 cm −1 arising from the hydrocarbon group connecting the living polymer to the chromium(II) site was split into two bands situated at 2768 and 2725 cm−1, respectively. These bands have been assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the methylene group. Previous experiments had shown that CO adsorption onto the active chromium(II)-A polymerization site led to bands in the IR spectrum at 2176 and 2170 cm−1 (the latter after 200 °C/ethylene treatment) and which exhibited a shift from 2179 cm−1 for CO adsorbed on a chromium(II)-A surface species before reaction with ethylene. Similar shifts have now been observed with bands arising from CO adsorption on to chromium(II)-C surface species situated at 2187, 2181 and 2191 cm−1, respectively. A model for polymerization initiation and for the mechanism of the polymerization reaction is proposed, which involves dinuclear surface species and explains several results obtained with the (reduced) Phillips catalyst.
