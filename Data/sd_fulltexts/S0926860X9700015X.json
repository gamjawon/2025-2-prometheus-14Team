CATALYSIS A: GENERAL ELSEVIER Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 Review Vanadia-titania catalysts for oxidation of o-xylene and other hydrocarbons p B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 30-239 Krak6w, Poland 1. Introduction - Historical outlook Following successful application of the vanadia-titania system for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride (PA), by the oxidation of o-xylene at the end of the 1960s/ beginning of 1970s [1], a large number of fundamental studies have been reported in the next decades. The reviews of the patents and papers published up to 1991 can be found in [2,3]. These studies aimed at the explanation of an ameliorating effect of inactive titania on catalytic properties of vanadia by thorough characterization of physico-chemical and structural properties of the system. Attempts (though less numerous) have been made to correlate the data obtained by various physico- chemical methods with catalytic performance in oxidation reactions. A good illustration of the extent of technical means engaged to characterize the vanadia- titania system (VTi) is provided by a work of the European group \"Eurocat-oxide\" animated by Vedrine and Bond [4], in which selected samples of this system have been studied by 24 research laboratories. With the exception of the first paper in the open literature on the subject by Vanhove and Blanchard [5], it was realized already in the mid-1970s that the modifying action of titania was manifested at low vanadia loading [6-8], at which an active oxide-support interaction could be anticipated. The first theoretical concept to explain the vanadia-titania interactions is due to Courtine et al. [9,10] who stressed the role of structural correspondence between some crystallographic planes of the two oxides and its consequences for phenom- ena at their interface (cf. Courtine and Bordes in this issue). Another keystone in the studies was provided by the works of Bond et al. [11-13], described also by its author in another paper in this issue. They showed that very good catalytic performance in o-xylene oxidation could be obtained at vanadia loading corre- sponding approximately to a monolayer of vanadia phase on the TiO2 surface by 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 applying a method of chemical fixing (grafting) of vanadia phase (used earlier by Hanke et al. [14] for preparation of V205/SIO2 catalysts). The monolayer content was estimated from crystallographic data on V205. This revived the interest in monolayer type of coverage of supports by oxides, reported by Rozeboom, Fransen et al. [ 15,16] for other oxide systems and other but grafting preparation techniques, and gave an impetus for extensive studies by different groups on the molecular structure and properties of vanadia VOx species which could be present on the titania surface. Supplementary encouragement for these studies was provided by the fact that VTi solids were found: (a) promising catalysts for oxidation of other hydrocarbons, such as toluene and its derivatives to selective oxidation products [17-21] and for ammoxidation of alkylaromatics, e.g. toluene and picolines [21-26], oxidation of methanol and ethanol [27-29], oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane [30- 32]; (b) good and applicable on the industrial scale in selective reduction of NOx with ammonia [33-35]. They were also tested but appeared little selective in oxidation of benzene [36,37], olefins [38-42], n-butane [43] and ODH of ethane [44]. In addition to anatase (AN), modification of titania, used commonly in industrial catalysts, several works began to appear in the mid-1980s concerning vanadia deposited on other modifications of TiO2 i.e. rutile (RT), [28,45-49] and so-called TiO2 (B) [50-54]. The practical aspect of these works was related to the possibility of using other titania modifications as supports for o-xylene and other hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, while the fundamental questions, which they evoked, per- tained to the correlations between the support structure and the properties and structure of the deposited species. It has been realized at the same time that impurities (e.g. K, P, Si, sulfates) present on the surface of commercial titania pigments, which are often used in the fundamental studies, may influence the structure and catalytic properties of VTi catalysts [17,55,56]. This inspired in the last few years several works in which other elements, in particular alkali metals have been introduced intentionally in a controlled manner to the VTi catalysts [30- 32,57-62], and their effect on structure and properties have been studied. On the other hand, to avoid the presence of impurities, the \"home made\" titanians were used in several studies. These were obtained usually by hydrolysis of TiCI4 or titanium organic complexes. It should be, however, observed that TiO2 prepared by this method may be contaminated on the surface by C1- ions or even adsorbed HC1 (when TIC14 is used as a precursor) [63], or may be slightly reduced (contains Ti3+ ions) when organic complex of titanium is used [64]. Notwithstanding such a rich history and the considerable progress made in characterization of the VTi system on a molecular scale, the problem of the modifying action of TiO2 on vanadia is still a subject of vivid discussions, several points demanding yet further clarification. With no ambition to cover the subject completely, the present paper is an attempt to present the main results and concepts displayed in the literature on the structure, B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 265 properties of VTi catalysts and on the mechanism of their action in oxidation reactions. The discrepancies which exist between different authors will be shown and some suggestions for future studies which might be done to clarify (in the author's opinion) the disputable questions will be given. Some new and unpub- lished data, obtained in the author's research group in Krak6w will be added in various paragraphs to strengthen some arguments. The author will, however, try to be as much objective as is possible, in reviewing the literature data. The catalytic data will concern oxidation of o-xylene and to a smaller extent, of other hydro- carbons. Oxidation of methanol on VTi catalysts is discussed in the paper by Forzati, Tronconi, Elmi and Busca published in this special issue. Other papers, herein, devoted entirely or in part to VTi system include con- tributions by Bond, Wachs and Weckhuysen. Some data on this system can also be found in the paper by Blasco and Lopez-Nieto. 2. Preparation of VTi catalysts 2.1. Techniques of deposition of vanadia phase The VTi active phase in industrial catalysts for o-xylene oxidation is usually prepared by wet impregnation of titania (usually AN) with different, water soluble, vanadium salts, or from slurry in water of titania support and vanadium salts or powdered solid vanadia. The obtained VTi paste is deposited on low specific surface area, macroporous carrier e.g. A1203. The deposition of the VTi component on the carrier can be done in various stages of the preparation e.g. after drying or after calcination. The latter operation is done at the temperatures ca. 650-773 K. Similarly addition of promoters (K, Rb, Nb, P, Sb, etc.) can be effectuated at different stages of the preparation. The vanadia content in VTi precursor varies between 5 and 15 wt% V205. The composition and different techniques of pre- paration of industrial VTi catalysts can be found in [2,3] and the references therein. The preparation methods used in academic studies include: . . Wet impregnation technique using aqueous solutions of: (a) ammonium metavanadate (MV); (b) V205 or MV dissolved in oxalic acid (e.g. [76]); (c) a special precursor of the formula (NH4)2V6016 [45]. Coprecipitation by hydrolysis of mixture of TiCI4 and VOC13 e.g. [65-68]. In the case of the wet impregnation technique in aqueous medium the essential parameter is pH of the solution and the vanadium salt concentration, which control the type and the charge of vanadium species in the solutions. A monomeric VO43- ion is present at pH higher than ca. 10, at lower pH various polymeric vanadate and hydroxyvanadate anions have been reported, the degree of their polymerization increasing with the decrease in pH [69,70]. The cationic form VO2+ is present at pH<2. Wachs et al. in their extensive review [71] stress 266 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 the fact that the pH in the surface moisture layer may differ from that in the solution, and may be imparted by the oxide support. The type of vanadium species in the solution in contact with the titania support surface may be controlled as suggested by Wachs et al. [71] \"by the net surface pH at pzc\". The values of pH at point of zero charge (pzc) reported for AN are ca. 6.5, those for RT 5.3 [72]. The impurities may evidently affect these values. 3. Adsorption from inorganic salts involving ionic exchange [ 15,16,73,74] or from organic complexes e.g. acetonylacetonates in non-aqueous medium [75]. 4. Thermal spreading (solid state (s.st.) reaction) of V205 on TiOa surface at temperatures varying according to different authors between 600 and 1000 K [65,66,77-80]. 5. Chemical reaction in the organic solvent medium between precursor of vanadium phase such as VOC13 e.g. [11-13] or vanadium alkoxides [76,81,82], and the OH groups on the titania surface. The reaction is followed by the hydrolysis of the vanadium complex attached (grafted) to the titania surface. The loading with vanadia can be easily varied using impregnation, coprecipita- tion or thermal spreading techniques by adjusting the amount of a vanadia precursor to the desired concentration in the solution, or in mechanical mixture of the two powdered oxides (technique 4). For the adsorption and grafting techniques the loading is determined by the adsorption capacity and/or concen- tration of OH groups on the titania surface. In principle such a method should lead to the formation of a bidimensional structure of vanadia species VOx. Depending on the concentration and localization of the adsorption sites and the OH groups on the TiO2 surface the VOx species may be isolated, form ilots or a monolayer of the vanadia phase. The critical parameter for V-loading when the grafting technique is used is then the degree of hydroxylation or hydration of the TiO2 surface. This can be controlled by the temperature of the support pretreatment, conditions of the preparation, and may also depend on the content of impurities on the TiO2 surface. Kijenski et al. [81] have employed the naphthenide titration method [83] to determine the OH concentration on supports. In most works in which the grafted catalysts have been studied such measurements have not, however, been per- formed, and the only parameter given by the authors which could help a reader to evaluate the extent of the TiO2 hydroxylation is the temperature of the support pretreatment before the grafting in the non-aqueous medium. It is thus not surprising that loadings with vanadia in grafted VTi reported in the literature vary in the wide range between ca. 0.2 and 0.9 of the theoretical monolayer. The second or multiple operations of grafting is then frequently used [81,82,84] cf. also the paper by Bond in this issue. The repeated grafting may involve: (a) a reaction of the remaining hydroxyls on titania, not reacted in the first operation, this leading to the increased coverage of the TiO2 surface with a bidimensional ilots (up to monolayer); or (b) a reaction of the vanadia precursor, VOC13 or an alkoxide with B.

Scheme for formation of monolayer and multilayer [VOx], species in VTi catalysts by grafting technique: (1) single grafting, (2) multiple grafting, (a): reaction with free OH groups on TiO2 support, (b): reaction with secondary OH~ groups on VOOH complex. the secondary OH groups which are present on the hydrolysed vanadium com- plexes immobilized already in the first operation on titania surface. The latter reaction leads to the formation of multilayer vanadia species [81,82,84], the part of the titania remaining still uncovered. Fig. 1 shows schematically these two possibilities. The notion of monolayer catalysts, even when used for the samples prepared by grafting, may be then somewhat confusing and a reader of numerous papers bearing in the title a term \"monolayer\" is advised to pay attention to their \"experimental part\" paragraph on the catalyst preparation, to judge whether the catalysts contain indeed a bidimensional VOx species or tridimensional VOx agglomerates, and whether a \"monolayer\" is indeed present. In the present work the term \"a monolayer\" signifies a theoretical value calculated from the crystal- lographic data with the assumption that the titania surface is covered completely by the VO2.5 units. The monolayer content corresponds to 10 V nm2 or 0.145 wt%/m2 as proposed by Bond [13]. 2.2. Calcination The calcination temperature used in preparation of VTi AN catalysts varies between 600 and 773 K. The phenomena which may occur in this temperature 268 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 range include: (a) decomposition of precursors with formation of various [VOx]n species; (b) dehydration of the formed species; (c) redox processes: e.g. reduction of vanadium in MV from V5+ to V4+ and V3+ (even in air atmosphere) [85] at lower temperatures, or oxidation from V4+ to V5+ if a precursor contains vanadylIv complexes (at higher temperatures, beginning from about 650 K); (d) crystal- lization of V205 or a reverse process; (e) spreading of crystalline V205 in contact with the Tit2 support [86,78-80] (\"wetting\" of the surface) by surface diffusion. The presence of water facilitates the spreading. There have been no systematic studies on the effect of the calcination tem- perature on the structure and what is even more important on the reduction degree of the VTi catalysts. One may suppose only that the extent of this effect depends on degree of dispersion of the vanadia phase, on the presence of impurities (e.g. potassium- known in ceramics as an additive to form enamels-should facilitate the spreading). At temperatures higher than ca. 823 K the transformation of AN into RT occurs with partial reduction of VzO5 and the incorporation of some V4+ into RT lattice (cf. Section 3.1): the presence of vanadia phase decreases the temperature of the AN ~ RT transformation, which for pure AN amounts to 1000-1300 K depending on the AN source. The specific surface area of VTi catalysts after this transition decreases considerably. Another parameter which may affect the extent of the phenomena mentioned above is the time of calcination which in different studies varies between 3 and 20 h. Again no due attention has been paid to this factor. The differences in the temperature and time of calcination may be, beside the presence of impurities, another reason for discrepancies existing in the literature on the structure and properties of VTi AN catalysts, particularly for the samples in which the dispersion of vanadia phase is poor. 2.3. Titania supports 2.3.1. Provenance 2.3.1.1. Commercial supports. Table 1 gives a list of some titania commercial supports used in preparation of VTi catalysts, their principal physical properties and main impurities reported for them. The content of K, P, and Ca impurities on the surface of some of them determined with the XPS technique [87] is also given. Degussa P-25 and Eurotitania (ET) (the latter prepared by Tioxide International for the Council of Europe Research Group on Catalysis, EUROCAT) do not show P and K impurities. The first of them contains, however, considerable fraction of RT, varying depending on the batch from 20% to 50% and is contaminated with A1 and Si. ET prepared originally as a support for metal catalysts is mentioned only in two papers on VTi catalysts by Bond [76,128] and was used by the present author [30] and unpublished results, mentioned further in the text.

The content of K and P can be considerably reduced by washing with water e.g. [76]. Besides the XPS technique, the surface potential (work function) method can be useful for identification of K on the TiO2 surface [87]. The advantage of the latter method lies in the fact that it furnishes information about the top-most layer of the surface and can moreover be applied in the wide range of temperatures and in controlled atmosphere. 2.3.1.2. Home-made (HM) titania. These are usually prepared by hydrolysis of TiCI4, titanium isopropoxide or isobutoxide. Calcination of the obtained gels up to ca. 1000 K yields AN titania, at higher calcination temperature the RT polymorph can be obtained, yet of low (ca. 1-3 m2/g) specific surface area. As shown by Trifirb et al. [89] RT samples of higher specific surface area can be prepared if hydrolysis of TiC14 is performed at pH< 1. Very pure TiO2 can be prepared by the flame method described by Teichner and Vergnon [90,91]. 2.3.2. Hydroxylation of titania surface and its acidity As discussed in Section 2.1, the extent of hydroxylation of the titania surface determines the coverage with vanadia species not only when the grafting or ion- exchange techniques of preparation of VTi catalysts are used. The titanium ions Ti4+, exposed after removing the hydroxyl groups, constitute the unsaturation sites of Lewis acid character which can also bind the vanadia species when other techniques of deposition are applied. The earlier works on chemistry of titania surface have been reviewed in [92-96]. The references to later publications can be found in [97-99,100]. 270 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 In brief the surface of titania exhibits the presence of molecular water and OH groups of various types (of different location, strength of bond and acidity), depending on the polymorphic modification, morphology of titania grains and on the nature of the surface impurities. The theoretical value for the maximum (saturation) OH content, derived from crystallographic data for the TiOz faces which contribute overwhelmingly to the exposed surface, is 12-14 OH nm-2 for AN and 9-11 OH nm-2 for RT, and the values close to those have indeed been observed at room temperatures. Experimental determination of the type and properties of the OH groups on titania has been performed with the use of IR e.g. [97,98], NMR e.g. [101] spectroscopies, measurements of adsorption (volumetric and calorimetry) [102]) or desorption (TPD) [103] of water. On heating the rapid decrease in the OH content has been observed up to the temperatures 523-673 K. The coverage of the titania surface with hydroxyls after heat treatment above ca. 550 K is decreased (for both AN and RT polymorphs) to 2-4 OH nm-2 [92]. The dehydroxylation can be reversible, although in some cases the irreversibility of the dehydroxylation has been observed after heating to 900 K [92, p. 188]. Stone et al. [ 102] reports that after heating of AN (free from sulfates, no other impurities given) to 1073 K, the RT formed in these conditions is hydrophobic, both dissociative and coordinative adsorption of water being suppressed. The IR studies show that the OH groups present on AN surface devoid of impurities do not provide the acidic Brrnsted sites and are incapable of protonating either ammonia or pyridine [97,98]. The presence of the Brrnsted centers claimed in the earlier reports appears to have resulted from the presence of sulfate, or chloride impurities. 3. Structure and properties of [VOx]n species on titania 3.1. Type of species and their distribution 3.1.1. Form of species 3.1.1.1. AN support. Fig. 2 shows different [VOx]n species on the surface of the Tit2 AN support, proposed on the basis of RA [71,74,104-106], FTIR [ 107-110], EXAFS [111,112] and UV-vis spectroscopies [113]. They include: isolated monomers VOx (MN) of oxo- or hydroxo-type, polymeric [VOx]n, (PV), species and V205 in amorphous or crystalline form. At very low vanadia loading, corresponding to about 10% of the mnl, only monomeric isolated forms have been observed. With increase in loading their amount increases and a new type of vanadyls is formed [61]. Beginning from about 20% of the mnl the appearance of polymeric forms has been observed. Their amount and the size B.

Different [VOx]. species on TiO2 anatase support. (number of vanadium atoms in species) increase with the loading. At loading exceeding 1 mnl amorphous and crystalline V205 are also observed [104-114], the latter being clearly seen beginning from 5 to 10 mnls. It should be, however, noted that vanadia-like species can be observed even below the 1 mnl content: the HREM studies on low specific surface area AN (\"CP grade\") for instance have shown the presence of such species already at 0.2 mnl [114]. The formation of solid solutions of vanadium ions in AN titania has also been reported on the basis of the XRD data [ 115] and postulated from the electrical conductivity measurements by Herrmann et al. in [4]. No changes in the lattice parameters of AN has been observed, however, in other works in which both commercial [45] and HM [79] AN of low specific surface area was used as a support for VTi catalysts. The coordination of vanadium, determined mainly from 51V NMR [71,117,118], UV-vis [113] and EXAFS [111,112] measurements, varies depending on the type of species and the conditions of measurements. Generally speaking the isolated monomeric species exhibit in dehydrated conditions tetraedric coordination which changes into octahedral on hydration. The polymeric forms and vanadia like species show CN of 6 (octahedron) or 5 (square pyramid). The extensive review of the structure and coordination of the dispersed [VOx], species on AN surface can be found in a review by Wachs et al. [71], and also in a paper by the same author in this issue. Although Wachs et al. stresses a role of impurities on AN in determining the structure of these species, the scanning of the literature on the subject shows a similar general qualitative picture i.e. monomers at low vanadia loading, and agglomerates (polyvanadates and VeOs-like species) at higher loading. The presence of impurities and the preparation methods and conditions seem to affect the population of different species and their mutual distribution, rather than their nature. 3.1.1.2. Rutile support. On the surface of RT titania the vanadyl groups have been observed [46,116-119] their intensity being, however, lower than that on AN 272 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 [46,116]. According to some authors [77,86], the bidimensional surface species on RT surface are unstable forming at relatively low temperatures grains of crystalline vanadia. At variance with them Wachs et al. [71,49] are, however, of the opinion that a monolayer of vanadia species can be formed also on RT, provided the pure support, without surface contaminations, is used. In view of the different crystallographic structure of AN and RT titania and different extent of the surface hydroxylation on the two polymorphs [92-96] one can hardly accept, however, that the structure of a vanadia monolayer on AN and RT is the same. Both amorphous and crystalline vanadia have also been observed for VRT solids. Following the arguments of Courtine et al. [9,10] the crystalline V205 formed on RT should exhibit different morphology than that crystallized in contact with the AN surface, since no correspondence of the crystallographic faces exists between vanadia and RT titania. No experimental data on this subject have been reported in the literature, with the exception of an observation by Gasior [66]. He found that, indeed, crystalline vanadia on RT (commercial support, RT-PL) exposes less of 010 face than vanadia on AN (AN-PL), both AN and RT containing VTi catalysts being prepared in the same conditions. At higher temperatures vanadium is incorporated into the RT structure with the formation of substitutional solid solutions vg+/RT [56,79,120-125,171]. This process is clearly seen at tempera- tures above ca. 820 K, but it can also be observed at lower temperatures, involving probably the RT surface. The reducing medium facilitates the incorporation [79,120]. 3.1.1.3. TiO2(B). The structure of (VOx)n species on this polymorph has been determined by Anderson et al. [51-54]. At low loading oxo-vanadium species in tetrahedral coordination have been observed, at higher loading crystalline vanadia, growing coherently at the titania interface, has been postulated from HREM images. It should be noted that identification of different vanadia surface species has been done in most cases for AN supports of relatively high (50 m2/g) specific surface area, whereas VT solids used in oxidation reactions have the specific surface area of ca. 10 mZ/g. For catalysts of low specific surface area the identification of surface [VOx]n species by spectral techniques is dubious in view of the low amount of vanadia phase (for TiO2 of 10 m2/g for instance the quantity of the vanadia phase in the mnl range of loading does not exceed 1 wt% V205). The Raman or IR spectra - the main fingerprint of the type of (VOx),, species - are for such solids poorly resolved and of low intensity. The use of the probe reactions to characterize low specific surface area VTi solid could be recommended, though this method cannot furnish direct information on the structure. So far the decom- position of isopropanol and of allyl iodide have been used as probe reactions to describe the VTi system (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5 in this paper). It should also be remembered that the studies discussed above have been performed on fresh catalysts; the type and structure of the species under the reaction medium may B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 273 be different, but so far no in situ studies with the techniques mentioned in this paragraph have been reported. 3.1.2. Distribution of [VOx]n species and titania surface coverage Mutual arrangement of the [VOx]n species and a fraction of TiO2 surface covered by them have been determined in an indirect way by selective chemisorption, or reactions involving only one type of sites (V or Ti) [126,127], and from the XPS data [128-131]. There is also a possibility of determination of the fraction of the surface covered by vanadia by the surface potential (work function, WF) measure- ments [132] if the support and the deposited phase exhibit different values of WF.Murakami et al. [126] has applied the following reaction: NO + NH3 + V=O ~ N2 + H20 + V-OH (1) to determine the number of V=O species and the number of layers of V205 lamellae on the support. In this approach the monolayer of vanadia species represents in fact a 010 face of V205. For the HM titanias (AN from hydrolysis of TiSO4, 48 m2/g, RT from hydrolysis of TIC14, 17 m2/g, vanadia deposited by impregnation with oxalic acid solution of MV) he has found that the bidimensional \"010 monolayer structure\" occupies about 50% of the titania surface both for AN and RT modifications. The method has, however, been criticized by Haber et al. [133] and later by other authors [134] on the ground that not only V=O but also V- OH centers are involved in reaction (1). The selective chemisorption with benzaldehyde [127] also shows that some fraction of titania remains uncovered even at vanadia loading exceeding 1 mnl. Again the selective chemisorption method may be censured. The fact that the chemisorption of a probe-molecule (adsorbable on a support but not on a deposited phase) is not observed on the mixed oxide, does not constitue a proof that the support surface is completely covered: one may argue that this is just the most active for chemisorption (unsaturated sites) which are covered by the deposited phase, leaving bare fraction of the support inactive for the chemisorption. For AN TiO2 the XPS data have been interpreted assuming a model in which the support surface is covered by a bidimensional structure on top of which \"towers\" of tridimensional V205 are deposited. Bond [128] considers that formation of tridimensional, first amorphous and then crystalline phase, commences at loading exceeding 1 mnl (ET, P-25 and low Anderson [ 129] claims, on the other of the mnl, the multilayers can be specific surface AN were used in his studies). hand, that already at the loading of about 50% formed (P-25 Degussa was a support in his studies). When low specific surface area AN with K impurity (AN-PL) was used, the change of the mode of dispersion was observed at ~2 mnl of vanadia [ 130]. It appears then that the coverage of the surface depends to some extent on the purity of the AN surface, better coverage being observed on impurity-free titania. One may recall, however, that HREM data (on pure AN) [ 114] cf. Section 3.1.1 showed the tridimensional vanadia already at ca. 20% of the mnl. The Murakami's data 274 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 [126] (even with the allowance being made for the criticism of Haber) would also indiciate that a tridimensional structure is formed below a 1 mnl loading, since according to [ 133] reaction (1) takes place at the corners of grains of vanadia. Thus the problem of coverage of the titania surface with vanadia species and the question whether a continuous monolayer can be formed remains still to be clarified. 3.2. Bonding of [VOx]n species to the titania surface Different environment of titanium atoms and variety in type and density of OH groups on the TiO2 surface, implies that various V-O-S bonds (where S symbo- lizes an atom of a support forming a bond with a VOx group) of different strength and location and hence of different properties, are formed during preparation of VTi catalysts. Kantcheva et al. [ 109,135] propose on the base of the IR studies that the Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) can localize oxo-hydroxy monomer, whereas the OH groups situated mainly at edges of TiO2 grains react to give mono-oxo species V=O (cf. Fig. 2). Deposition of vanadia phase in the form of epitaxial layers continuing the structure of TiO2 has also been proposed for AN and TiO2 (B). In several works the treatment of VTi catalysts with ammonia or dilute H2SO4, which are known to dissolve VeOs, has been applied [4,79]. The amounts of insoluble vanadia strongly bound to AN-TiO2 surface, which by some authors is considered as a \"real\" monolayer, are given in Table 2. As seen from Table 2, the content of insoluble [VOx]n species denoted hereafter by a symbol INS-V varies between 0.1 and 0.6 mnl. No definite correlation can be found between the amount of INS-V and the degree of the support purity, or a preparation method. It is interesting to note that quite considerable amounts of vanadium can be extracted from the catalysts prepared by grafting containing before the dissolution 1 mnl of [VOx]n species: after treatment with ammonia the INS-V amounts only to ,-~20- 30% of a mnl. This finding indicates that the species present in a nominal 1 mnl are inhomogeneous not only in form but also in strength of their bonding to the AN surface. It may also imply that some vanadia-like species are present, already at 1 mnl loading, thus supporting the data on multilayer structure of mnl catalysts, discussed in the preceding paragraphs. For the same type of HM support, the data obtained in our group [137] show that the concentration of INS-V slightly decreases when the specific surface area varies between 7 and 100 m2/g. In fact, a similar decrease was reported earlier by Centi et al. [79] for HM AN prepared in a similar way and of the specific surface area varying between 10 and 18 m2/g, though the absolute values reported by them are slightly higher than ours. In a series of papers the Italian group claims that the INS-V content amounts to about 0.9 of mnl, though they consider the value of 0.1 wt% of V205 per 1 me as a monolayer content. The reasons for the discrepancies between different works can be several, including different time of dissolution (e.g. much shorter in the works of Centi and Trifir6 et al. than in ours), different concentrations and types of dissolving B.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 agent, difference in analytical procedure. The detailed discussion of the problem can be found in a paper by Nogier, summarizing the studies of the European Group EUROCAT-oxide in [4]. Beside different dissolution and analytical procedures another explanation for the discord in the results can be some inclusions of vanadia species between the support grains or in the support pores or even in the AN lattice, which would render them inaccessible to the dissolving agent, thus increasing the determined amount of INS-V. Little is known about the structure of INS-V species. Some preliminary results with ESR [138] and NMR [139], IR and Raman [140] techniques indicate that even after the dissolution the remaining INS-V species on AN are not quite homo- genous, several types of signals being observed. The Raman spectra [140] in ambient conditions showed a broad band at about 940 cm-1, after dehydration under vacuum no signal was however observed, the sample becoming fluorescent. It seems that further detailed studies are required on the structure of INS-V, the more so that - as it will be shown further in the text (cf. Sections 3.4 and 3.5) - these species exhibit quite interesting chemical properties. The discussion of these properties can provide some arguments for the proposed mechanism of action of VTi catalysts in oxidation reactions (cf. Section 6). On RT the content of INS-V is higher than on AN [79] due to the formation of solid solutions of V4+ ions in the RT lattice. For TiO2 (B) Anderson reports the value close to 1 mnl [126]. 3.3. Oxidation state of vanadium in VTi catalysts The oxidation state of vanadium in vanadia-titania catalysts in particular at low, up to 1 mnl vanadia content is a matter of controversy. Some authors consider that the monolayer on AN contains only V5+ species [ 13,60]. In several studies with use of different techniques such as chemical analysis [45,65,79], ESR [46,79] and UV- vis spectroscopies [113,123] it has been, however, shown that vanadia phase even in fresh, calcined in air samples is partly reduced. The total reduction degree decreases with the amount of vanadia in the region when crystalline vanadia is present [45]. In the ESR studies the VO2+ species has been perceived on both AN and RT titania [46,79], their density being higher for AN [46,116]. At higher loading a signal typical of V4+ ions in the V205 matrix has been observed [46]. Most authors agree that vanadia-like species, soluble in NH3 aq. or diluted H2SO4 are mainly in the oxidation state V5+. As mentioned earlier in this paper (cf. Section 3.1) the RT containing samples show moreover the presence of V4+ ions in substitutional solid solution in RT. Another point of disagreement is the oxidation state of vanadium in INS-V species. The group of Trifirb claims [79] that vanadium in INS-V species which cover almost completely the AN surface is present as V4+. At variance Gasior et al. [45] and Anderson [126] find only about 20% of reduced vanadium ions at 1 mnl content on AN. The INS-V which constitutes according to B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 277 the Polish group about 20-30% of total V for low specific surface area catalysts, is present, however, mostly as V4+. It is, however, a little surprising, to find that the ESR spectra presented by Trifirb et al. [79] show a well developed hps, which would point out to V4+ ions rather isolated on the surface. If they form really, as alleged by the authors, almost a monolayer, the distance between the V4+ ions (corresponding to the distance between the Ti ions in most populated faces on AN surface) should be about 0.38 nm. At this distance the interaction between the spins of V4+ unpaired electrons would broaden considerably the spectrum. To explain results of the Trifir6 et al. one may then assume that most of reduced vanadia in their samples is present as V3+ ions, not detectable by ESR. The data discussed above pertain to the fresh catalysts, after calcination in the oxidizing atmosphere. It should be, however, remembered that the oxidation state of vanadium ions changes in the hydrocarbon/air reaction mixture. This point will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. 3.4. Reducibility of VTi catalysts and properties of catalyst oxygen The reduction of the VTi AN catalysts has been studied by statical volumetric [8,141] or gravimetric [112] and TPR e.g. [13,104] techniques, using mainly hydrogen or CO as a reducing agent and in the conditions in which titania is not reduced. The reduction of the VTi system has also been observed in the presence of ammonia [ 136]. All the authors agree that the vanadia phase is more easily reduced at low loading of the deposited phase than at the supra-monolayer content of vanadia, the order of reducibility being: mnl species > amorphous > crystalline vanadia. Haber and Kozlowski [112] show that at the vanadia content ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mnl a number of oxygen atoms removed per Vatom in reduction by H2, CO and propene is close to 1. The lower value (~0.5) observed for propene is ascribed to the formation of carbonaceous deposit during the reduction with the olefin. The monolayer structure assumed by them from the earlier EXAFS studies [11l] consists of tetrahedral monomeric vanadate units, covering successively the AN surface as the V-loading increases. In the Raman and TPR/TPO studies reported by Bell et al. [104], in which both monomeric vanadyls and polymerized vanadates are shown to be present at the monolayer range of loading, the same stoichiometry of reduction (with hydrogen as a reducing agent) has been observed. The authors claim moreover that the terminal V=O groups in the both species are removed preferentially to the bridging oxygen atoms of the polymeric species. As shown, however, in another paper by the same group of authors [136] the monomeric isolated vanadyls are not reduced by ammonia: the presence of adjacent V=O groups is necessary for the reduction with ammonia to occur. 278 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 The reduction studies provide only an indirect information about the strength of V-O bond and the ability of the catalyst oxygen to become inserted in the hydrocarbon molecule; the rate determining step r.d.s, in reduction involves the rupture of a C-H bond not related directly to the V-O bond energy. More direct determination of this parameter by investigation of the rate and energetics of the oxygen isotopic exchange (OIE), has been performed by Blanchard et al, [142], and recently by Wachs et al. [143]. In an early paper [142] a correlation between the activation energy of the OIE and the selectivity to PA in o-xylene oxidation has been shown - it should be, however, observed that Blanchard's et al. results [5,142] pertain to high loading catalysts, in which V205 is the dominating vanadia species. For the low, nml loading of the catalysts Wachs [143] claims that the oxygen in the V=O terminal bonds is less active in OIE than the bridging oxygen in the V-O-S bond. It should be perhaps noted in this place that Ozkan et al. [144] in her studies on pure V205 of different morphology, observed higher rate of OIE on the samples, in which 010 face of vanadia rich in V--O groups was preferentially exposed. The quantum chemical calculations of Witko et al. [145] (see also paper 2 in this issue), show preferential (energetically) sorption of hydrogen atom on a bridging oxygen in VOx cluster as compared to terminal V=O bonds. The problem of the reactivity of oxygen atoms in different environment, in particular the difference between the bridging oxygen in V-O-V or V-O-S species and terminal vanadyl V=O oxygen, remains one of the important questions to be clarified before the molecular mechanism of the VTi action in oxidation reactions could be established in a reliable way. Some information about the capability of the catalyst oxygen to be inserted into an organic molecule can also be obtained using a probe reaction of decomposition of allyl iodide. This reaction, proposed by the present author [146] to support the bicenter mechanism of olefin oxidation of Haber et al. [147,148] can proceed according to the scheme: C3HsI---->C3H5- CsHlo (1,5-hexadiene, HEX) C3Hs+ +02- > C3H40 (acrolein) -H (2) The reaction can be considered in fact as a probe not only of the reactivity of the lattice oxygen, but also gives some information about the capability of the catalyst B.

Table 3 shows the results obtained in tests of this reaction on VTi catalysts before and after dissolution of vanadia phase by ammonia. As seen the INS-V species, covering about 20% of the titania surface are incapable of cationization of allyl species and insertion of oxygen, HEX being the main reaction product. The formation of acrolein is observed only when higher V-loading samples are used. As mentioned in Section 3.2 the data on the structure of INS-V species are rather poor. Still the presence of reduced VO2groups has been observed in two works [97,138]. Both the V4+-O bond energy and capability of accepting electron by reduced V4+ species should be lower for such species as compared with the V5+-O bond and the V5+ ions present at higher loadings: the fact that only HEX was observed for INS-V species is then not incompatible with the structural data. Beside the lattice oxygen, the chemisorbed oxygen species can be important when considering the properties of VTi catalysts. There are very few papers in which chemisorption of oxygen and the form of oxygen species have been reported [30,149,150]. It appears that oxygen is chemisorbed practically only after treat- ment of the samples in vacuum or in reducing medium, hence it is rather a reoxidation of the reduced catalyst which is studied and not the surface adsorption process. The measurements with the surface potential (work function) method [30,150] have suggested the presence of some amount of O- species on VTi catalysts of high V content for temperatures up to 623 K, while at higher temperatures only 02- lattice oxygen has been observed. 3.5. Acid-base properties These have been determined by the IR studies of adsorbed bases, ammonia and pyridine [61,107,109,123,151,152] and by a probe reaction of isopropanol decom- position [153-156]. The IR measurements for sub-mnl and mnl. V content on AN 280 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 have shown the presence of medium strong Br6nsted and strong Lewis acidic centers [61,107], their strength increasing with the vanadia loading. Pure AN has been shown to contain mainly Lewis acid sites, both Lewis and Br6nsted have been identified on V205 [157]. The Br6nsted sites on VTi have been associated with the V-OH groups (cf. Fig. 2), the Lewis centers with vanadium ions in coordinatively unsaturated VO2+ groups [107] or in V5+=O groups in vanadate species. The presence of weak, nucleophilic (basic) sites has also been reported by Busca from the studies of adsorption of CO2 and benzaldehyde [107]. The isopropanol decomposition proceeds by two parallel routes: dehydration to propene on acidic (rather weak) sites and dehydrogenation to acetone on redox (basic) sites. This reaction cannot distinguish between the Br6nsted and Lewis sites. Its advantage lies in the fact that it can be applied to low-specific surface area catalysts for which the spectroscopic techniques cannot provide the reliable data. The studies of this reaction on VTi catalysts have shown drastic changes in the selectivity to acetone and propene (thus in acid-base properties) at the mnl loading on AN, as compared with crystalline vanadia [45,154,155]. Pure V205 yields propene as a main reaction product with the selectivities varying between 90% and 65% depending on the morphology of the samples [158]. The propene selectivity decreases and at the same time selectivity to acetone increases with the increasing contribution to the sample surface of the 010 face. In contrast, for the mixed VTi- AN samples acetone has been found to be the main reaction product (selectivity Table 4 Isopropanol decomposition on some VTi catalysts before (B) and after treatment with NH3 aq.

The yields of propene increased considerably at high loading at which the presence of crystalline V205 was observed. These results indicate that the species present in the mnl range of loading on AN exhibit mainly dehydrogenating properties. The amounts of propene (a measure of concentration of acidic sites) in this range of loading depend on the specific surface area, and provenance of the AN support (the presence of impurities), as shown for illustration in Table 4. For the same type of the support the amount of propene increases with the specific surface area. It is lower when the K-contaminated support has been used. It is interesting to note that after treatment with ammonia or isobutanol, the amount of propene decreases drastically, the INS-V species exhibiting only dehydrogenating properties and practically no acidity. 4. Oxidation of hydrocarbons on VTi catalysts 4.1. o-xylene 4.1.1. AN titania as a support Only-non-promoted VTi catalysts will be considered in this paragraph, though the presence of impurities in AN in some cases may exert non-controllable promoting action. Moreover in most of the studies discussed in this paragraph the low specifiC area (7-10 m2/g) AN has been used in keeping with the active VTi mass used in industrial catalysts [3]. The reaction has been studied in the temperature range 623-663 K in which most of the industrial processes of the PA production are performed. It follows a parallel- consecutive route, the primary product of the oxidation being o-tolualdehyde. Fig. 3 shows after Wachs et al. [159] the reaction scheme proposed by different authors. The dependence of selectivity to various products on the total o-xylene conversion reported by the same authors [159] is shown in Fig. 4. At the conversion approaching 100% the selectivities to PA reported in the literature [3] vary between 60% and 80%, depending on the preparation method (techniques of the deposition of active phase, calcination temperature, type of the support, and the presence of promoters), The selectivities to tolualdehyde (TA), phthalide (PhD) at these conversions do not exceed about 1-2%, that of maleic anhydride MA vary between 1% and 4%. The selectivity to PA, reported by Wachs [159] does not change with the o-xylene conversion between 50% and 100%. In some papers, however, a drop of the PA selectivity to PA at conversions higher than about 95% has been observed [165]. This can be due to overoxidation of PA to COx occurring in the lower parts of the catalytic bed, in which the concentration of PA is high and that of o-xylene low. The detriment in the selectivity to PA is accompanied by the increase in the selectivity to COx (step 5 in Fig. 3), which in most of the studied 282 B.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 283 works varies between 20% and 30%, depending again on the preparation method, and V-loading. The passage from o-tolualdehyde to PhD (step 2) may involve several sub-steps such as for instance formation of dihydrobenzofuran (phthalane), 3,4-benzofuran (isocumaron), the latter being capable of adding oxygen to yield an unstable adduct by a Diels-Alder reaction [166]. The activity and selectivity to PA, or generally speaking to C8 products increases usually with the V-loading up to about 1-3 mnl and then remain constant or slightly decrease. This has been ascribed to the low activity of pure vanadia present at higher loadings. It has, however, to be observed that pure V205 can also be active in o-xylene oxidation [167] and thus the constancy or only slight decrease in the activity and selectivity to the C8 products may be due to the fact of low specific surface area of the V205 crystals as compared to the area of the dispersed species. The selectivity to PA of vanadia depends moreover on the morphology of the vanadia grains [ 167]. Both the size of grains and their morphology can be varied by the preparation method. For illustration Fig. 5(a) presents the changes in the selectivity to PA (at conversions close to 100%) for the mixed VTi AN catalysts of 1 7 --A~ \"'\", \\ 55 \\= -\"'~, ~, 2 \\\\ \\x 1 50 011 012 013 0), 015 016 Q7 018 019 110 i.1 morphological factor, f, [3o-~1o] Fig. 5.

The low values of f correspond to solids in which the contribution of the 010 face of vanadia to the overall surface area of the vanadia crystalline phase is high. The different morphology has been obtained by using different preparation techniques of the preparation [65]. For comparison the results of Gasior and Machej reported for pure vanadia [167] are given in the same figure (curve b). As seen the selectivity to PA decreases both for the mixed VTi catalysts of high V-loading and for pure vanadia. It can be, however, observed that for the same value of the morphological factor the selectivities of the mixed VTi catalysts are higher than those of pure crystalline vanadia. The modifying action of AN cannot be then explained only by the epitaxial effect exerted on vanadia by the AN TiO2, but should be rather sought for by taking different than V205 species present on the AN surface into consideration. Still, the contribution of vanadia (amorphous or crystalline) to the overall activity and selectivity to various products cannot be completely discarded, particularly at higher V-loading and for samples in which tridimensional V205 species form grains of high specific surface area. Another conclusion, which can be drawn from Fig. 5, is that for the same methods of preparation (samples 4) the values off and the selectivities to PA are different when AN and RT supports are used. The effect of the preparation method on the catalytic performance is illustrated in Table 5, which shows the selectivities to PA at high conversions 90-99% for a series of catalysts containing 5-10mo1% (approx. 10-20 wt%) of V205 are obtained by impregnation (I), coprecipitation (C) and solid state (thermal spread- ing) (S) techniques. The catalysts were calcined in air (samples A) or heated in deoxygenated nitrogen (samples N) at 773 K. As seen from Table 5, the pre- cipitation methods 1C and 2C yield catalysts of poor catalytic properties, the selectivities to PA (practically equal to the PA yields at such high conversions) not exceeding about 50%. For the impregnation and solid state techniques the selectivities are much higher, varying for different precursors in the range from 60% to 73%. The V-loading chosen in this study is close to that used commonly in industrial processes. It can be noted, however, that a similar value of selectivity (70%) has been obtained for a catalyst containing 1 mnl and prepared by the grafting technique 1G [169]. Some general features can be moreover observed for all the preparation methods: 1. The samples prepared in nitrogen are as a rule less selective than the samples of the same vanadia content and obtained from the same precursor, but calcined in air. 2. The reduction degree is changed during the catalytic reaction: the samples of high initial reduction degree are reoxidized whereas those of low reduction degree are reduced. B.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 287 The problem will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. concerned with the changes of the VTi catalysts in the reduction medium. It should be mentioned that Trifirb et al. [67] report similar values of selectivity to PA for both coprecipitation and impregnation techniques. In their work, however, the low values 50-55% have been found irrespectively of the preparation technique: these values are close to that of ours observed for coprecipitation method, but much lower from those reported in Table 5 for other preparation methods. In more recent papers by the same group of authors the values of about 70% are given for catalysts prepared by the solid state technique [79], especially when solid vanadia reacts with an AN support previously covered with a monolayer INS-V species, and when the reaction is carried out for a long time. The above discussion pertains to the reaction temperatures higher than about 623 K. At lower temperatures of the reaction the lower selectivities to the C8 products and in some cases the increase of activity and selectivity with V-loading have been found [165]. Bond et al. [170] ascribe these selectivity changes to the formation of carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface, which is responsible for poor carbon balance observed at these temperatures and is at the same time a source of additional COx formed by the burning off the adsorbed tar. Another explanation of this effect is that, as mentioned previously, at temperatures below and above 623 K the electrophilic O--species have been reported [30], these leading to total combustion of o-xylene or the intermediate products. 4.1.2. Rutile-containing VTi catalysts Several studies have shown that after heating the VTi AN catalysts at tempera- tures higher than about 773-813 K both the activity and selectivity to C8 products decrease drastically [ 121,171,172]. These unfavorable changes have been unan- imously ascribed to the: (a) decrease in the specific surface area of the catalysts, (b) transformation of AN polymorph to the RT form accelerated in the presence of vanadia phase, which is accompanied by (c) partial reduction of vanadium and incorporation of reduced vanadium ions into the RT lattice. There is, however, a difference in opinions when AN and RT of comparable specific surface area are used as supports for catalysts prepared in the same conditions i.e. with the same deposition technique and at the same calcination temperature (773 K), lower than that at which the undesired processes (a)-(c) take place. Table 6 compares the catalytic behavior of the catalysts in which vanadia phase has been deposited in the same manner on AN and RT titania. The biggest difference in activity and selectivity between AN and RT supported VTi catalysts have been observed by the author's group [45]. The characterization of the physicochemical properties of these two types of catalysts has shown that the properties of vanadia species on RT (RT-PL) resemble those of pure vanadia, whereas modification of both redox and acido-basic properties with respect to vanadia has been observed for the AN-supported (AN-PL) samples. 288 B.

Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 289 Smaller differences between the two types of the catalysts have been reported by Wachs et al. [48] (the commercial Mobay AN support and calcined P-25 RT were used in this case). The works of Trifirb et al., however, have shown that although indeed the V/RT (HM) samples produce more PhD than the V/AN (HM) [80], the catalytic performance of both types of catalysts (the yield and selectivity to PA) is similar if a special preparation method is applied and moreover if the catalysts are used for a long period of time [79]. To obtain this V205 was thermally spread on HM AN and RT supports containing the INS-V species. After the long reaction time the catalysts of both type reveal the presence of reduced amorphous phase. Its composition corresponds to V307. Trifirb et al. claim that this suboxide, superimposed on inactive INS-V species, is the active phase in o-xylene oxidation. The slight differences in the V/ AN and V/RT samples, in particular higher amounts of PhD are according to them due to different density of INS-V on the two titania modification. 4.2. Oxidation of other hydrocarbons on VTi catalysts Table 7 summarizes catalytic data obtained for VTi catalysts in oxidation of: (a) alkylaromatics such as toluene and its derivatives, (b) benzene and naphthalene, (c) olefins, and (d) alkanes. The VTi catalysts are quite active and selective in oxidation of toluene the main products being benzaldehyde (BA) and benzoic acid (BAc) [17,20,58,174-176]. Considerable amounts of MA, a product of degradation of the molecule are also formed. Comparison of the results obtained by different authors is difficult as different reaction conditions were used in different works. Some observations can be however made. The catalytic perfor- mance in this reaction is influenced to higher extent than oxidation of o-xylene by the presence of contaminations, particularly of K and P on the support surface [175,176]. The presence of the K impurity in the VAN catalysts leads to the considerable decrease in the yield of products of the side chain oxidation (BA and BAc). For the K- and P-free catalysts the maximal yield of these products amounts to ca. 30% with the selectivities about 60% at 50% conversion. When the K and P impurities are removed the activity and selectivity to BA and BAc are higher for the VAN catalysts as compared with VRT samples. The activity and selectivity increase considerably in the monolayer range of V-loading and increases only slightly or remains constant at higher V content. In this respect the oxidation of toluene resembles the o-xylene oxidation on VTi catalysts (see Table 8). Quite considerable amounts of MA, particularly at higher toluene conversions have been observed, the MA yield in some works being 75-100% of the ~-]~BA+BAc yield. It can be noted, however, that the selectivities to MA are lower for the mixed VTi catalysts as compared with pure V205, for which MA is the main product in oxidation of toluene. Oxidation of p- and m-xylenes on VTi catalysts [177] yields respective alde- hydes (Aid), the activity and selectivity of the p-isomer being higher than those of 290 B.

The selectivity to respective aldehydes decreases sharply with the conversion, MA becoming the main oxidation product in addition to COx. Similar behavior has been noted in the oxidation of p-tertbutyltoluene and p- methoxytolune to respective aldehydes [20] which are often used as components of fragrances. The selectivities to p-methoxy-BA (anisic aldehyde) do not exceed 40% at conversion 15-25% and are higher at high V-loading. The VAN samples are more active than VRT catalysts even if the former catalysts contain the K impurity. The selectivity to p-tertbutyl BA are lower: 30% at conversions about 20%, the VAN samples being again more active. The formation of MA is also observed especially at higher conversions of the hydrocarbons, which indicates that this product is formed in the consecutive route by oxidation of the aldehydes. It should be noted in this place that better performance in oxidation of alkylaromatics described above has been exhibited by catalysts not containing vanadium. Good yields and selectivities to BA and its derivatives have been found for telluromolybdates of transition metals in particular of Mn [19,178]. No formation of MA anhydride has been observed for these compounds. The V-Ti catalysts show, on the other hand, quite good performance in ammoxidation of toluene and its derivatives [179-183]. The oxidation of benzene [36,37] and naphthalene [184] on the V-Ti catalysts proceeds with a rupture of the aromatic nucleus yielding respectively MA and PA. The high V-loading catalysts, containing crystalline vanadia, are considerably more active and selective than the low V-loading samples. One may observe, however, that the yield and selectivities to MA in the oxidation of benzene on the VTi catalysts are much lower than those reported for conventional catalysts used up to now in this process i.e. the V-Mo-O system (cf. paper by Najbar and B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 295 Bielafiski in this issue). The yield of PA in the naphthalene oxidation is, on the other hand, quite high and approaches at high conversions (about 100%) the values obtained in the o-xylene oxidation (75%). In the oxidation of lower olefins Cz, C3 on the VTi catalysts carbon oxides are the main reaction products with only small amounts of oxygenates [39,40,44]. Quite high selectivities can be, however, observed in oxidation of butenes, both ODH products (butadiene, BD) [153] and oxygenates being found. The butadiene oxidation leads to the formation of MA [56] or furan [43]. It is interesting to note that the formation of products of the ODH reaction is favored at the low V- loading, whereas better yields and selectivities of oxygenated products are exhibited at higher loading. At low temperatures and in the presence of steam the formation of acetic acid and acetaldehyde has been reported [38]. The presence of steam in the reaction mixture and low reaction temperatures (around 520 K) endorse the formation of oxygenated products also in the case of the oxidation of lower alkanes e.g. ethane [44]. In this case, however, in contrast to n-butene reaction the reaction proceeds without the breaking of the C-C bond, acetic acid and acetaldehyde being formed from ethane. The reaction of propane in the presence of oxygen at high temperature conducts to the product of ODH- propene, with no formation of the oxygenates. The selectivity is much improved by the addition of alkali metals to the VTi catalysts. High activity and selectivity to propene are attained already at 1 mnl V-loading and change only very slightly with the increase in the V content, n-Butane reaction reported in [43] for high loading catalysts yields only the degradation products (acetic acid) with the rather low selectivity. Again the VTi catalysts cannot compete with the best catalysts for n- butane oxidation based on the V-P-O system (cf. the papers by Volta and Abon and Trifirb in this issue). From the data described above it appears that for reactions involving the activation of a C-H bond (oxidation of the side chain in alkyl aromatics, ODH of alkanes and alkenes) the low V-loading catalysts are active and selective, and the excess of vanadia do not influence markedly the catalytic performance. On the other hand the reactions in which the breaking of the C-C bond and formation of the oxygenated products takes place require the presence of the bulk vanadia. 4.3. Changes of the VTi catalysts in the hydrocarbon reaction medium The changes of the VTi catalysts during the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions include the following: (1) Changes in the reduction degree of vanadium. The reduction degree is usually measured after removing the catalyst from the reaction medium and special care should be taken in cooling the samples from the temperature of the reaction to the ambient temperature. The cooling is usually done in the inert gas atmosphere. The reduction degree (expressed as a fraction of V4+ ions in a catalyst) in the stationary state of o-xylene oxidation reaction amounts to about 20-30% at the 296 B.

[79] for higher loadings; after performing the reaction up to 500 h the VaO7-1ike species has been identified in the used catalysts. On the other hand Nobbenhuis et al. [60] have found only V5+ ions after the reaction, suggesting that the procedure of cooling in inert gas may change the oxidation state to the lower one. The measurements in situ performed with the surface potential WF technique in the olefin/air reaction medium have shown, however, a certain, degree of reduction of the catalyst surface [150]. Fig. 6 shows the values of the surface potential for VTi and V205 samples registered in the flow of hydrogen, ethene, propene and butene- 1 and their mixture with air at different temperatures. The high values of the surface potential indicate high negative charge of the surface due to the presence of 02- ions. The values of the potential in the hydrocarbon air mixture B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 297 can be thus taken as an indirect measure of the reduction degree (impoverishment of the surface in oxide ions). As seen in Fig. 6 the surface potential is lower in pure hydrocarbon and in the hydrocarbon/air mixture as compared with the oxygen atmosphere, indicating that the catalyst surface is reduced in the reaction conditions. The order of the potential values is: C4H8 < C3H6 < C2H4 ~ H2 < 02. This sequence follows the order of the C-H (H-H) bond energy, the latter parameter controlling the rate of reduction of the oxides with hydrocarbons. It is interesting to note that the surface potential values in the reaction mixtures are higher at higher temperature. This indicates that the catalyst surface is more oxidized as the reaction temperature increases, most probably due to higher reoxidation rate in these conditions. The surface potential of VTi catalyst under oxygen is slightly lower than that of pure vanadia suggesting a slight reduction of V in the former system. The values in the hydrocarbon or reaction mixture are, however, lower for pure oxide and moreover change to higher extent as the reaction temperature increases. (2) The o-xylene/air mixture influences also the dispersion of the vanadia phase. The thermal spreading of vanadia reported even for the oxidizing atmosphere [80] is enhanced in the reaction conditions [77,79]. Both amorphous vanadia and the dispersed monolayer-type species are formed. The amount of the INS-V increases at the same time [79]. The phenomenon has been observed on both AN and RT modifications by the Italian group [79] using HM supports, and only on AN polymorph by Haber et al. [77]. In the last case, however, the commercial RT which could be contaminated with Si was used. The increase in the V/Ti ratio after the o- xylene oxidation observed with the XPS technique for a high loading VTi AN catalyst [60] indicates better dispersion of vanadia phase and is then in keeping with the results on thermal spreading of V205. (3) The deactivation of the VTi catalysts in the o-xylene/air mixture at high reaction temperatures about 800 K (which can occur locally in the catalyst bed), is due to the formation of solid solutions V4+ AN-RT transformation, and changes in the specific surface area. The problem has been mentioned already in Section 4.1. (4) At low reaction temperatures and at low conversions formation of carbonac- eous non-volatile deposit can lead to poorer catalytic performance in o-xylene oxidation conditions as shown in the works of Bond and Portela [170] (cf. Section 4.1). 5. Effect of additions on catalytic properties and structure of VTi catalysts The first papers in the mid-1970s on this subject are due to the Russian group of Boreskov et al. [57], who have shown that the addition of small amounts of alkali 298 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 atoms to VTi catalysts improves their selectivity to PA. The decrease in acidity of the alkali-promoted systems, measured by a probe reaction of cumene cracking, followed the same order as the increase in the selectivity. The interest in the effect of the additives especially of the alkali metal oxides has been revived recently. Nobbenhuis et al. [60] have studied the effect of K, Ba, Bi, W and Sn promoters on catalytic performance of VTi catalysts containing 8 wt% V205 on EL-10 AN Tit2. At higher reaction temperatures (643 K) the PA yield followed the sequence: K<Ba<Bi<unpromoted=W=Sn. The same sequence has been observed for the strength of acid sites. At low conversion and low temperature only basic promoters have a positive influence. No general correlation has been found between the redox properties and the catalytic performance. Andersson et al. have studied the effect of K addition to VTi catalyst (3.5 wt% V205 on P-25 Degussa) in toluene oxidation, the K/V ratio varying from 0.125 to 10.1 [58]. The activity decreased rapidly with the amount of K added up to K/V ratio=0.4 and then remained constant, its value being only ca. 2% of the activity of unpromoted catalyst. The selectivity to BA was little affected but that to the acidic products MA decreased. The formation of potassium vanadates has been observed at higher K content. The effect of the phosphorus additive to the same catalyst has also been inves- tigated [176], the P/V ratio varying between 0.25 and 5.0. Phosphorus showed a strong negative effect on the activity in toluene oxidation and the selectivity to side-chain oxidation products. At high P/V ratio crystalline vanadium phosphates have been detected. In a series of papers the effect of alkali metals, in particular of K, on structure and catalytic properties in the ODH of propane on VTi catalysts has been studied [30- 32,185,186]. It has been found [31 ] that the addition of small amounts of Li, K and Rb to VTi catalysts of 1 mnl V content [Tiox - 48 m2/g, V/Alk=10] leads to the decrease in the total conversion of propane but increases (at comparable conver- sions) the selectivity to propene. The order of the increasing selectivity is: unpromoted < VTiLi < VTiK < VTiRb. (3) The acidity of catalysts decreases and the basicity increases following the same sequence. The changes in the acid-base properties induce the easy desorption of propene preventing its further oxidation to COx and thus improving the selectivity to the olefin. The decrease in the activity, in the order reverse to (3) has been ascribed to blocking of the propane activation centers by the alkali atoms, this effect increasing with the increasing radius of the alkaline cation. More detailed studies on the structure of catalysts in which vanadia phase has been deposited by grafting on the AN surface (Tiox - 24 m2/g) covered with controlled amounts of K atoms have led to a model of distribution of VOx species on K-doped AN surface [185] (Fig. 7). The Tit2 surface contained 1.2 and 2.5 K nm-2, which corre- sponded to 0.5 and 1 mnl of K, evaluated in earlier studies [87]. At K content of 0.5 mnl K the vanadia species are located beside the potassium atoms on the bare fraction of the Tit2 surface (Fig. 7(b)). For the surface saturated B.

Published with the kind permission of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge. with K atoms (Fig. 7(c)) the VOx species cover also the K atoms on the AN surface. Formation of potassium vanadate is also observed in the latter case. It also appears that the covering of the TiO2 surface with K shifts the formation of polyvanadate species towards higher vanadium loading (>1 V mnl) as compared with non-doped catalysts. In the K-free catalysts these latter species have been observed below 1 mnl of VOx. In this respect a model is in agreement with the early results of van Hengstum et al. [17] who have shown that the optimum of the activity in toluene oxidation (corresponding to the formation of monolayer type species) is moved towards higher V-loading when K-contaminated AN is used as a support. It should be, however, noted that the model proposed in Fig. 7 is derived from the measurements with WF and 51V NMR techniques, and no direct proof for the structure of the VOx species (such as can be provided by e.g. Raman spectra) is given. The confirmation of the model would require further studies particularly with the vibrational spectroscopy techniques. In continuation of these studies it has also been shown [186] that the order of K addition to the VTi catalysts: (a) K deposited first on the TiO2 support and then vanadia added, or (b) vanadia deposited first and then K added affects the type of species and catalytic performance in ODH of propane. Thus the presence of K in a form of an impurity (modeled by case (a)) or introduced as a promoter on calcined 300 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 VTi catalysts (case (b)) may lead to slightly different structure and properties of the VTi catalysts. It should be, however, observed that the structural studies in which the effect of K addition was clearly seen have been concerned with catalysts containing much higher amounts of K than those discussed. Only for such highly doped systems (V/ K=0.4-1.0) the clear differences in the e.g. Raman or IR spectra have been observed [62,175-187] and the presence of potassium-vanadium well-defined oxide compounds has been registered [174,175]. Deo and Wachs [62] divide the additions into those interacting with the support or more precisely with a V-O-S bond (e.g. K) or non-interacting additions (e.g. W). The additives of the first group considerably influence the reduction behavior of the VOx species, the second group has only a slight effect. 6. Mechanism of action of VTi catalyst in oxidation of hydrocarbons It has been generally accepted that selective oxidation of hydrocarbons requires the presence of three essential types of centers on a catalyst surface: (a) the sites for activation of the C-H bond in a hydrocarbon molecule which is a r.d.s, in most oxidation processes, (b) the sites for insertion of oxygen into an organic molecule species adsorbed on the surface after step (a), (c) centers for reoxidation (or adsorption of molecular oxygen) [188]. Most of experimental works as well as quantum chemical calculations indicate that it is an oxygen atom (most probably 02- ion on the catalyst surface) which is an active center for a rupture of a C-H bond. The ability of an oxygen atom (ion) to abstract a hydrogen atom from a C-H bond can be related in such a case to its nucleophilicity (basicity). The activity of the oxidation reaction would then increase with the increase in the oxygen basicity. The rate of the insertion of oxygen (step (b)) would depend in the first place on a Me-O bond energy, and in the second place on a number of oxygen atoms in the vicinity of an organic adsorbed species. It is obvious that more oxygen atoms are required for oxidation reactions in which organic anhydrides (PA, or MA) are formed than for formation of aldehydes (e.g. BA or TA) or for the ODH (e.g. propane to propene) reactions. For the ODH reactions oxygen atoms are only necessary to form water from the abstracted hydrogen, though evidently the formation of water also occurs in the reactions which form the oxygenated products. Undesirable total combustion would require a high number of oxygen atoms and low Me-O bond energy. Both the oxygen nucleophilicity and the M-O bond energy depend on: (1) the nature and oxidation state of a cation constituting an oxide lattice (primary parameters) and (2) environment of an active center, which decide the coordination of an active oxygen site, and the Me-O bond order (secondary parameters). The secondary parameters can be manifested in the dependence of the catalytic performance on morphology of an oxide grain (for bulk oxides) and on the structure of dispersed B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 301 active species (for supported oxides). For reoxidation of a catalyst which involves chemisorption of an oxygen molecule followed by the reaction: O2+e~O2+e~20-+2e~202- ,the presence of reduced cations (va+,v3+) and the easy electronic transfer (low WF values) from a catalyst to an adsorbed 02 molecule is required. Finally other exigencies for an oxide catalyst to be selective include the easy desorption of the formed products, which depends on the acid-base properties of a catalyst, these being interrelated with the valence state of the cation. The desorption of acidic product such as PA or MA would require rather high acidity (high acid strength) of the catalyst, whereas for the desorption of an olefin e.g. in an ODH reaction, low acidity and rather higher basicity would be the conditions for a selective catalyst. Let us consider now the structure and properties of V-Ti catalysts in the light of the above general remarks. The breaking of the C-H bond is considered to be the r.d.s, in oxidation of alkylaromatics, olefins and alkanes on VTi catalysts [189]. In fact the IR measurements of adsorbed toluene and o-xylene [190-194] have shown the presence of benzyl and Me-benzyl intermediate species. The Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism has been tacitly assumed for the oxidation reactions on these catalysts. The overall correlations between the V-O bond energy Ev_o and the selectivity to the oxidation has been indeed found for oxidation of o-xylene to PA [142], higher selectivity to PA being observed for high Ev_o. It can also be observed that higher selectivity to propene has been found for systems in which the values of WF are smaller [30] and thus the reoxidation to 02- should be easy (no O- species observed). The fact that in the stationary state of the reaction the surface of VTi catalysts is reduced, fulfills the requirement for reoxidation process, the reduced V4-- or V3+ ions providing the sites for this step. The correlations between the overall acid-base and catalytic properties of V-Ti catalysts are not so straightfor- ward. It has been observed for the ODH of propane on alkali promoted VTi catalysts that the selectivity to propene increases when acidity decreases and basicity increases, but no general conclusion can be drawn if we consider different hydrocarbon reactions on VTi system. Thus both selectivity to PA (acidic product) and to olefins (basic products) are higher at low loading of Von titania than on pure V205. No direct correlations can be found between the catalytic performance and the total reduction degree of VTi catalysts either. The explanation of this lack of correlations can be provided by the fact that the overall acid-base properties or the total reduction degree involve different [VOx]n species, while only some of them may be active and selective in a given reaction. Moreover it cannot be excluded that different reactions require different [VOx]n species, some of them being more \"facile\" or \"demanding\", in the Boudart's notation, than the others. Let us pass, then to the discussion of the correlations between the catalytic properties of VTi catalysts and the molecular structure and properties of [VO~]n 302 B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 species described in Section 3. A structure of active phase (active species) in VTi catalysts is still a subject of a vivid dispute. Three main approaches to the problem can be discerned in the existing literature. (1) The hypothesis of Courtine [9,10], followed in the works of Murakami [126], in which active sites are provided by V=O groups covering the titania AN surface in the form of bidimensional 010 face of V205. The coherent interfacial boundary between 001 and 010 faces of AN and 010 plane of V205 and its suboxides down to VO2 (B) facilitates an electron and matter (oxygen?) transport between the solids, which would explain the high activity of the system. The arguments for this hypothesis are: better activity and selectivity of [VOx]n species on AN Tit2 as compared with RT (questioned in some works cf. Section 4), good catalytic properties when Tit2 (B) isostructural with VO2 (B) is used as a support. One would expect that if this hypothesis is correct the catalytic properties should depend on the morphology of AN, but no experimental studies concerning this problem have been reported so far. The model of Courtine has been criticized and even unjustifiably discarded by some authors (Bond [189] and Wachs [71]), who propose another approach as described below. (2) In the second approach the [VOx]n species active in oxidation reactions on VTi catalysts are the species present at the monolayer range of V-loading, and not related directly to the support crystallographic structure. Bond [189] considers only one type of species: i.e. oxohydroxyspecies o=vS-OH as active sites for the reaction, neglecting the facts that several other species, proposed by other authors (e.g. polymeric species of the structure proposed by Went, Bell et al. [104,105]) or V=Ox monomers are present on the AN surface. In this approach no reduction of the vanadia phase in the initial state of the catalysts is taken into account. Nor is it quite clear what would be the role of OH group (more precisely of H present in this group) in the mechanism of the reaction, except for the statement that the VO-OH group would provide optimum redox and acido-basic properties. Wachs on the other hand stresses the role of different V-O bonds in the vanadium species, V=O terminal bonds being claimed as important in his earlier works and V-O-S bonds and the bridging oxygen in more recent papers [71,143]. In the opinion of the present author in view of the multiplicity of [VOx]n species stated incontestably in several works (cf. Section 3), and the disputable problem of their distribution, the problem cannot be approached assuming only one type of species as active in the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Thus the calculations of the TOF frequency reported in some works [71 ] seem a little premature if only one type of species is taken into account, or if the TOF frequency is calculated assuming that all vanadium present at the monolayer content of V is accessible to a reacting molecule [a multilayer species cannot be excluded even at this loading (cf. Section 3)]. The monomeric species, and INS-V species seem to be little active in o-xylene oxidation, they can be, however, of interest in ODH reactions at which a B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 303 lower number of oxygen atoms is required. As an illustration Table 7 shows the catalytic behavior of INS-V covering about 30% of the TiO2 surface in these two reactions. As seen the INS-V species which, as shown previously, possess high dehydrogenating properties and low ability to insert oxygen into a hydrocarbon molecule, exhibit quite good activity but low selectivity in o-xylene oxidation but are active and selective for the propane ODH. It appears then that some degree of polymerization and presence of V-O-V chains is required to render the VTi catalysts active for formation of oxygenated products. The INS-V partially reduced species containing VO2+ groups could be proposed as centers for abstraction of H from a C-H bond in a hydrocarbon molecule and polymeric species (either in polyvanadate dispersed on the surface species or vanadia like species) as centers for insertion of oxygen. In fact the inactivity in this step of species at very low loading of V has been observed by Busca and Rives [195] also in isobutene reactions, which yielded only the products of isobutene polymerization; the oxygenated products were found at higher vanadia content. The role of the dehydrogenating species can be illustrated by the data shown in Fig. 8, in which the yield of PA (a) and of acetone from isopropanol decomposition (b) are plotted as a function of the vanadia content for VTi AN catalysts obtained by different preparation methods. The optimum yield of PA, which for different preparation methods is observed at different V2Os-content, coincides quite well with the yield of acetone - indicating the correlation between the concentration of the dehydrogenating (INS-V) species and the activity of the catalysts in formation of PA. (3) The third hypothesis, due to the group of Trifirb claims that the mnl species, not active in the selective in o-xylene oxidation act only as anchoring points for the active phase, which in their opinion is provided by amorphous tridimensional layers of V3OT-like oxide. The arguments for this hypothesis lie in the fact that according to these authors the stationary state of VTi catalysts (both the structure of catalysts and catalytic properties), after several hundred hours of use in the reaction o-xylene-air mixture, is the same irrespective of the titania modification and resembles that of pure V307 oxide. On the other hand they do not negate the fact that the structure and population of monolayer species, which fix the V307-1ike phase are slightly different for AN and RT. It is not easy to reconcile these three approaches. The common point of the first two approaches is the accent put on the V=O groups present in the dispersed VO, species, though their direct role in the reaction mechanism is not clear. The common point in the Trifirb's et al. and the present author's opinions is that the active species for formation of oxygenates should contain several oxygens which can be provided by V-O-V chains present both in polymeric bidimendsional species and vanadium bulk oxides. It can also be observed that both the groups find similar values [4.7-4.8] for the oxidation state of vanadium after the stationary state of the reaction has been attained. The differences between the three hypothesis still remain to be clarified. 304 B.

Conclusions The modification of properties of V205 dispersed on the AN titania surface is due to the existence of several [VOx], species dispersed on the TiO2 surface. The species differ in their structure, strength of the bond to the support and physicochemical and catalytic properties. An epitaxial effect of the AN support, consisting in preferential growth of crystalline V205 with preferential exposition of the 010 face, cannot be excluded. The main surface [VOx],, species include monomeric oxo- and oxohydroxy groups at low V-loading and polymeric vanadates at higher V content. The amorphous and crystalline vanadia can also be present. The distribution and population with the different species depend on the preparation method, and the presence of contaminations on the AN surface. At the vanadia loading, corresponding to 1 theoretical monolayer (estimated B. Grzybowska-Swierkosz/ Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 305 from the crystallographic data as 10 V nm-2) in addition to the bidimensional monomeric and polymeric vanadates, a multilayer structure cannot be excluded. The existence of continuous bidimensional layer covering homo- genously the AN surface seems little probable, even when the support devoid of impurities is used. A considerable fraction of the vanadia species present at the monolayer loading is weakly bound to the AN support and can be removed by treatment with ammonia or dilute sulphuric acid. The amount of the insoluble vanadium species (INS-V), strongly bound to the support, varies according to different authors between 0.1 and 0.6 of the theoretical mnl. The INS-V contains the reduced V ions in the form of VO2+ groups: the extent of the reduction of this form and its structure remain to be clarified. The INS-V species exhibit only dehydrogenating and no acidic properties, as shown by the probe reaction of the isopropanol decomposition. These species may be involved in breaking of a R-H bond in a hydrocarbon molecule, but are not capable of insertion of oxygen atoms with formation of oxygenated products. They can be active, however, in the ODH reactions. The [VOx],, groups on RT titania have a structure similar to those on AN: their distribution and coverage as well as their thermal stability is not yet fully clarified. The differences in catalytic performance in o-xylene oxidation of VTi catalysts containing AN or RT TiO2, observed in early works, are mainly due to the presence of contaminations (Si on RT, K and P on AN). On the supports devoid of impurities the yields of PA are comparable for the two titania modifications, though lower than for K-contaminated VAN catalysts. The VTi catalysts are reduced in hydrocarbon/air reaction mixture. The extent of the reduction depends on the nature of hydrocarbon (the strength of C-H bond which is broken). The mean oxidation state of vanadium ions in VTi catalysts after o-xylene oxidation is a subject of discussion: the several works give the value 4.8 (20-30% of reduction of the vanadia phase). The maximal content of vanadium in VTi catalysts required to obtain the maximal performance in the oxidation of hydrocarbons depends on the nature of the oxidized molecule. The reactions involving an activation of C-H bond, such as oxidation of alkylaromatics and ODH of olefins and alkanes, exhibit maximal selectivity and yield to partial oxidation products at low V content (1-3 mnl) at which the dehydrogenating centers are abundant. It is, however, still disputable whether the active phase for these reactions comprise bidimensional [VOx]n species, or tridimensional amorphous or crystalline vanadia. The reduction degree of this phase remains one of the problems still to be solved. 306 B. Grzybowska@wierkosz/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 263-310 For activation of the aromatic ring (oxidation of benzene, naphthalene and alkylaromatics to maleic anhydride) higher loadings of vanadium and the presence of the V205 phase appear to be necessary.
