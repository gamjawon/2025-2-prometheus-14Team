Increasing the active sites upon single-atom catalysts is an optional strategy to increase the catalyst efficiency. In this study, the loading of three and four Group VIII and Group IB transition metal (TM) atoms on poly(triazine imide) (PTI) nanosheets was firstly explored. Meanwhile, comprehensive first-principles investigations were carried out to explore their structural stability, electronic properties, and catalytic performances in the context of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results indicate that 11 catalysts are suitable candidates for HER applicability among the total 38 catalysts. Notably, the 4TM@H-PTI catalysts have more active sites than 3TM@H-PTI and show more effective electron transfer with the substrate. Consequently, the 4TM@H-PTI catalysts can be regarded as novel and highly prospective candidates for HER applications. The present work provides valuable insights and paves the way for the design of co-catalysts on PTI that are both low-cost and high-performance, potentially creating novel opportunities for progress within the realm of photocatalysis and sustainable energy.

To accelerate the global energy transition and achieve green, low-carbon development, it has become a shared responsibility of the international community. Hydrogen energy is considered an ideal environmentally friendly energy source for the 21st century [3,4]. Photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen (H2) represents a promising technology that could provide a clean and sustainable approach to long-term energy supply [5–7]. The ultimate goal in solar hydrogen production is the development of highly efficient, stable, and cost-effective photocatalysts. In this context, carbon nitrides have emerged as promising metal-free visible-light photocatalysts due to their abundance, stability, and chemical tunability. Historically, a variety of strategies have been employed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of carbon nitrides. These approaches include atomic doping [8–11], conjugation of organic molecules with other semiconductors or dyes to form heterojunctions [12–17], and morphological modulation [18–20]. In these previous investigations, the exfoliation of carbon nitrides into ultrathin nanosheets has been demonstrated to significantly enhance photocatalytic activity through surface and quantum confinement effects. Schwinghammer et al. demonstrated that crystalline carbon nitride nanosheets which were prepared by ionothermal synthesis and liquid-phase exfoliation, significantly enhance visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution due to increased surface area and quantum confinement effects [21]. The family of crystalline two-dimensional carbon nitrides (2D-CN) synthesized from C/N precursors (such as melamine and dicyandiamide) and alkali metal chlorides (used as solvents) has proven to be an excellent platform for hosting transition metal (TM) atoms, facilitating a wide range of catalytic reactions. Roy et al. found that incorporating copper single-atom catalysts into 2D-CN markedly boosts CO2 electrolysis to methane, highlighting the cooperative effect of single-atom dispersion for improved catalytic performance [22]. Over the past decade, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in multiphase catalysis. They have superior performance in atomic efficiency, selectivity, stability and activity. Moreover, through support engineering, there is the ability to precisely regulate the quantum state [23–28]. Despite their notable advantages, SACs face challenges including susceptibility to agglomeration or deactivation under harsh reaction conditions, as well as limited tunability due to their single active sites [29]. In contrast, atomic cluster catalysts exhibit the advantage of tunable composition, which allows precise control over catalytic activities. For instance, studies have shown that atomic clusters outperform single-atom catalysts in platinum-catalyzed HER, significantly enhancing catalytic performance and highlighting the advantages of atomic clusters for efficient hydrogen generation [30]. Additionally, research has revealed a synergistic effect in M4 atomic clusters (M = Fe, Ni) supported on MN4-graphene, leading to markedly improved catalytic activity and efficiency in HER applications [31]. In the field of catalysis, selecting an appropriate substrate is paramount for achieving optimal catalytic performance [32]. The substrate not only provides a stable support for active species but also plays a crucial role in modulating their electronic and geometric properties, thereby influencing reaction pathways and selectivity [33]. Traditional supports, such as metal oxides, zeolites, and carbon-based materials have been widely investigated, but the low surface area, poor conductivity, or insufficient stability under harsh reaction conditions considerably restrict their development. To address these challenges, 2D materials have emerged as promising alternatives due to their unique physical and chemical properties, including high specific surface area, excellent electron transfer capabilities, and tunable surface chemistry [34–36]. Among the various 2D materials, Poly(triazine imide) (PTI) has garnered significant attention for its exceptional performance in catalytic applications. PTI, a layered carbon nitride material, exhibits a highly triazine structure with good crystallinity, a large specific surface area, and robust catalytic performance [37]. PTI is composed of triazine units. These units are connected by imide groups and stacked in an AB - type arrangement. The stacking is separated by weak van der Waals forces. Lithium and chloride ions are situated within channels. These channels run along the stacking direction of the layers [21]. PTI, characterized by its highly graphitized structure and rich nitrogen content, offers an ideal platform for anchoring TM atoms and clusters. Its distinctive architecture allows for precise control over the coordination environment of active sites, facilitating enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Moreover, the inherent porosity and defect-rich surfaces of PTI provide additional advantages for efficient mass transport and strong interactions with catalytic species. Recent studies have demonstrated the remarkable potential of PTI as a robust substrate for diverse catalytic processes [38,39]. For instance, Cypher et al. demonstrated the efficient conversion of ethanol to n-butanol using transition-metal-incorporated PTI frameworks, presenting a novel catalytic material with potential for upgrading alcohols to higher-value products [40]. Additionally, Le et al. performed first-principles calculations to investigate nitrogen reduction on crystalline carbon nitride supported by homonuclear bimetallic atoms [41]. Their work screened TM combinations that effectively promote the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). These findings highlight the versatility and promise of PTI as a next-generation catalyst support material, particularly in energy conversion applications such as water splitting and nitrogen reduction. In this study, based on theoretical simulations of experimental photodeposition and cation-exchange methods for cocatalyst loading, we systematically investigated the loading behaviors of Groups VIII and IB TM clusters (containing 3 or 4 metal atoms) on the PTI and deprotonated PTI (H-PTI), respectively. The catalytic activity of these loaded TM clusters was systematically compared by focusing on the geometric models and electronic structures of the catalysts. Specifically, we investigated the HER performance, screened suitable catalysts, and further examined the effects of the number of active sites and the coordination environment of the metal catalysts on photocatalytic activity. This comprehensive analysis provides robust theoretical support for the development of efficient water splitting catalysts. Notably, our computational results reveal that Groups VIII and IB TM atomic clusters incorporated into both PTI and H-PTI composite systems exhibit significant HER catalytic activity across a wide range of hydrogen coverages. These systems also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and high structural stability. 2 Computational details All computational tasks were executed utilizing the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) software, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations [42,43]. The exchange and correlation energies were parameterized by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the framework of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Electron-ion interactions were modeled using the projected augmented wave (PAW) method [44,45]. The plane-wave expansion cutoff energy was set to 550 eV. Geometry optimizations were performed until the energy and force convergence criteria were met, specifically when the energy difference and force were below 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 1 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh for structural optimization, while a finer 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid was employed for electronic property calculations. To account for van der Waals interactions [46], the dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 method was implemented. Charge transfer analysis was conducted employing the Bader analysis approach [47,48] Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were conducted to assess the thermodynamic stability of the materials under NVT ensemble conditions at 500 K, with a time step of 1 fs and a period of ∼10 ps. The simulated system comprised a total of 72 atoms, with 24 carbon, 36 nitrogen, and 12 hydrogen atoms, enclosed within a simulation cell of dimensions 17.11 × 17.20 Å2. The influence of k-point selection on binding energies was evaluated and is detailed in Table S1. It was determined that the choice of k-points had a negligible impact on the outcomes. Hence, gamma-point approximation was adopted for this study. For hydrogen atoms adsorbed onto the surface of transition metal clusters, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG H*) was calculated as follows: Δ G H * = Δ E + Δ E Z P E − T Δ S Here, ΔE represents the electronic energy difference, ΔE ZPE denotes the zero-point energy difference between the reactant and product states, and ΔS is the entropy change, all of which were directly derived from DFT calculations. T is the temperature in Kelvin (298.15 K), and under the harmonic approximation, ΔE ZPE and ΔS were determined, with the substrate contribution considered negligible [49]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structures and stability of TM@PTI and TM@H-PTI The size of the pores within substrate nanosheets plays a crucial role in controlling both the number of metal atoms and the cluster structure. Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets, such as C3N4, C2N, C3N5, and C9N10, are typically rich in micropores, with their electron-rich nitrogen edges providing excellent adsorption sites for metal atoms [50,51]. For conventional g-C3N4, the diameter of these pores is only 4.78 Å. Previous studies have indicated that this pore size is particularly suitable for the formation of mono- or diatomic metal clusters [52–54]. In contrast, PTI has a central pore diameter of 7.27 Å, which is significantly larger than the pore diameter in g-C3N4. This larger pore can accommodate multiple metal atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The metals chosen for loading encompass TM elements from groups VIII and IB, as these elements are generally considered excellent catalyst candidates. To evaluate the stability of metal clusters on the substrate, we introduce the average binding energy (E bind). This quantity is calculated as follows: E b i n d = ( E n T M @ P T I / H − P T I − n E T M − E P T I / H − P T I ) / n where E nTM@PTI/H-PTI is the total energy of the system with TM clusters loaded to the substrate, E PTI/H-PTI is the energy of the unloaded substrate, E TM is the energy of the individual isolated metal, and n is the number of atoms of the loaded metal cluster. According to this definition, when E bind < 0 eV, it indicates thermodynamic stability; the more negative the value, the tighter the binding of the metal clusters to the substrate. In the cavities of PTI and H-PTI, due to the higher electron density at the six nitrogen sites, metal clusters can be more easily loaded into the substrate cavities, as shown in Fig. S1-S4. Among the 12 TM clusters studied, the three-atom clusters (3TM@PTI), which include Fe, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au, exhibit a triangular configuration with D3h symmetry. In these structures, each metal atom forms an M-N2 coordination environment with two nitrogen atoms from the substrate. However, for the trimeric clusters composed of Co and Ni, only two metal atoms form M-N2 bonds with the substrate. For four-atom clusters (4TM@PTI), one metal atom occupies the apical site, while the other three metal atoms bind to the nanosheet similarly to the trimeric clusters, forming M-N₂ coordination with two nitrogen atoms from the substrate. This configuration resembles active sites in single-atom catalysts, where individual metal atoms are isolated and anchored on the support. Such a structure may enhance the activity of the HER [50], as the metal atom at the apical position can provide additional active centers, while it is maintaining the effective exposure of the other three metal atoms. This optimizes the electronic structure and facilitates the proton transfer steps during the catalytic process. Tetrametallic clusters exhibit smaller and more stable average binding energies compared to trimetallic clusters. In dehydrogenated PTI (H-PTI), to maintain the electroneutrality of the entire system, six hydrogen atoms need to be removed from the loaded trimetallic clusters and eight hydrogen atoms from the tetrametallic clusters. The locations of the removed hydrogen atoms include the six hydrogen atoms inside and outside the hexagonal pores and the hydrogen atoms at the N positions connecting the triazine rings, as labeled in Fig. 1(a). This is due to the fact that the metal clusters adsorb hydrogen very easily, and the N-H bonds in the delta pores are easily broken during the dehydrogenation reaction, preventing the structure from being destroyed. After loading the metal clusters, the metals are more likely to form M-N3 coordination with nitrogen. The tetrametallic configuration can be distorted by the influence of substrate nitrogen atoms, leading to tighter bonding with nitrogen. The atomic radii of Au, Ag, and Os are large enough to form clusters and bond with nitrogen. However, most metals are too far apart (more than 3 Å) to form clusters, so configurations like 3Fe, 3Co, 3Ni, 3Cu, 3Ru, 3Rh, 3Pd, 3Ir, 3Pt, and 4Ag@H-PTI were excluded from this study. To assess the thermodynamic stability of 3TM@PTI, 4TM@PTI, 3TM@H-PTI, and 4TM@H-PTI, AIMD simulations were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S5. These simulation results indicate the well-maintained geometric frameworks, demonstrating good thermodynamic stability. Additionally, according to Fig. 2 (a), the average binding energy of nTM in H-PTI is generally more negative than in PTI, indicating that dehydrogenated TM clusters bind more tightly to the substrate, suggesting stronger interactions between the metal clusters and H-PTI. 3.2 Electronic properties of TM@PTI and TM@H-PTI Bader charge analysis and differential charge density plots (Table S2, Fig. 3 , and Figs. S7-S10) reveal the electron transfer properties between the metal clusters and PTI in the 3TM@PTI, 4TM@PTI, 3TM@H-PTI, and 4TM@H-PTI systems. For 4TM@PTI, the tetrametallic clusters exhibit an electron-rich state, in contrast to the trimetallic clusters (three TM atoms bonded at the bottom of the PTI), which exhibit more significant electron loss. This electron distribution pattern suggests that the TM atoms at the apex position act as electron acceptors, while the TM atoms at the bottom act as electron donors, which contributes to efficient charge redistribution within the cluster. For all systems, the extent of electron transfer to the substrate increases with the removal of H atoms from the substrate as shown in Fig. 2(b). This indicates that H-PTI promotes greater electron transfer to the metal clusters compared to pure PTI. In addition, the charge transfer is slightly enhanced with the increase in the number of metal atoms. The enhanced electron transfer from the metal clusters to the dehydrogenated substrate indicates a stronger metal-carrier interaction, which is essential for stabilizing the system and suppressing the photogenerated carrier recombination. The increase in charge transfer not only improves the stability of the dehydrogenated PTI, but also strengthens the metal-substrate interaction, which enhances the catalytic performance and stability. Thus, the large amount of electron transfer observed in these systems highlights the importance of optimizing metal-substrate interactions to enhance catalytic activity and stability, especially in applications involving reduction reactions. The calculated density of states (DOS) for all catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. S6. As shown in Fig. 4(a), for pure PTI, the projected density of states (PDOS) reveals a band gap of 3.17 eV. Notably, the valence band maximum (VBM) orbitals predominantly localize around the N atoms, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) orbitals are mainly distributed around both N and C atoms. Upon the addition of metal clusters, a significant alteration in the electronic structure occurs. As illustrated in Table S2, the energy band gap is substantially reduced due to the contribution of metal in the band gap of PTI. Interestingly, it is observed that the four-atom clusters induce a more pronounced reduction in the band gap compared to the three-atom clusters. This distribution of metal within band gap is conducive to electron conduction, playing a pivotal role in facilitating electron transfer during the photocatalytic process. 3.2 Photocatalytic HER activity of TM@PTI and TM@H-PTI Next, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of the nTM@PTI and nTM@H-PTI systems were further investigated. There are two primary reaction mechanisms for the HER: the Volmer-Tafel mechanism and the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. However, regardless of the mechanism, the formation of H* (adsorbed hydrogen atom) is critical as the initial step in the reaction. The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG H*) of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the catalyst is widely regarded as a reliable indicator for evaluating catalytic activity [55–57]. According to Sabatier's principle [58–60], the absolute value of ΔG H* for HER catalysts should be minimized to allow spontaneous adsorption/desorption of hydrogen without activation energy barriers. Too strong or too weak ΔG H* at the catalytic site can be detrimental to the reaction. Specifically, when H* adsorption is too strong (ΔG H* < 0), the HER process is limited by the H* desorption step (H* + e⁻ → 1/2H2). Conversely, when H* adsorption is too weak (ΔG H* > 0), the H atom adsorption step (H⁺ + e⁻ → H*) on the catalyst surface becomes rate-limiting step. Therefore, the Volmer step is a critical focus in the study of the HER. In this study, we screened catalysts with |ΔG H*| < 0.2 eV, which is considered industrially viable [61–63]. We examined the possible reaction sites on both bulk nTM@PTI and nTM@H-PTI systems and identified two main adsorption modes for hydrogen atoms, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The adsorption structures and corresponding ΔG H* values for hydrogen on these systems are detailed in Fig. S11-S22. Summarizing the ΔG H* values for all sites, it is evident from Fig. 5(b) that the 3TM@H-PTI system exhibits suboptimal HER activity due to the limited number of candidate catalysts and large negative metal adsorption energies. In contrast, each of the 3TM and 4TM@PTI systems contains three types of metal composites that meet ideal catalyst conditions: the top site of Cu, the top and bridging sites of Ag, the bridging site of Pt, and all sites of Co and Ru, as well as the top site of Os. The 4TM@H-PTI system features five types of potential HER catalysts: the top site of Ru, all sites of Os (including one bridge site and a top site connected to the substrate), the top site of Ir, and the bridging site of Pt. Notably, the higher number of metal cluster atoms leads to more available reaction sites. In this study, the ΔG H* values of 4Ru@H-PTI, 3Ag@PTI, 4Os@H-PTI, 4Ir@H-PTI, and 4Pt@H-PTI are −0.05, 0.06, −0.02, 0.03, and −0.03 eV, respectively, showing similar performance of the Pt(111) [64], and are better than that of GDY/Pt(111) catalysts (∼−0.25 eV) [65]. Compared to 4TM@PTI, the 4TM@H-PTI systems have more N bonds and lose more electrons, attributed to significant electron transfer from TM clusters as donors to the substrates as acceptors. This electron transfer effectively activates the relevant N and TM atoms, thereby enhancing catalytic performance. Through an in-depth analysis of the interaction mechanism between the adsorbates and the catalyst surface, it was found that the d-band center energy level of the TM sites in each system can serve as a key descriptor, effectively reflecting the strength of the adsorption of the adsorbents on the metal active sites. Therefore, the d-orbital electron center of the optimized and stable catalysts was calculated, and the ε d values are shown in Table S3. For example, the ε d values of 3Ni@PTI, 3Ru@PTI, and 3Os@PTI are −0.54 eV, −0.53 eV, and −0.50 eV, respectively. These values are very close to the Fermi level. As a result, the active sites will strongly adsorb H*, leading to poor catalytic activity. For the candidate catalysts, except for 3Ag@PTI, the d-band centers are all located in the middle position of ε d, ranging from −0.59 eV to −2.84 eV. 4 Conclusion In this study, we investigated the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of PTI nanosheets loaded with ternary- and quaternary-metal clusters for the HER using DFT calculations. Binding energy assessments and AIMD simulations revealed the excellent stability of PTI systems loaded with TM clusters, which ensures their durability and reliability in practical applications. Detailed electronic characterization showed that electron transfer within these systems is significantly influenced by both the number of metal clusters and the quantity of substrate H atoms. Significant contribution of metal within the band gap indicates the enhanced catalytic activity for excited electron to transfer to clusters for HER. The HER catalytic performance was found to be closely related to the electronic structure modifications induced by the metal cluster loading, which facilitate efficient charge transfer, thereby promoting superior catalytic efficiency. Overall, this theoretical study reveals that the quantity and type of metal clusters significantly impact the catalytic performance of carbon nitride materials. The findings provide key insights and a solid basis for designing advanced photocatalysts. It also advances the fundamental understanding of metal-cluster-doped carbon nitrides and offering practical guidelines for developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts for hydrogen production.

        "dc:description": "Increasing the active sites upon single-atom catalysts is an optional strategy to increase the catalyst efficiency. In this study, the loading of three and four Group VIII and Group IB transition metal (TM) atoms on poly(triazine imide) (PTI) nanosheets was firstly explored. Meanwhile, comprehensive first-principles investigations were carried out to explore their structural stability, electronic properties, and catalytic performances in the context of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results indicate that 11 catalysts are suitable candidates for HER applicability among the total 38 catalysts. Notably, the 4TM@H-PTI catalysts have more active sites than 3TM@H-PTI and show more effective electron transfer with the substrate. Consequently, the 4TM@H-PTI catalysts can be regarded as novel and highly prospective candidates for HER applications. The present work provides valuable insights and paves the way for the design of co-catalysts on PTI that are both low-cost and high-performance, potentially creating novel opportunities for progress within the realm of photocatalysis and sustainable energy.",
