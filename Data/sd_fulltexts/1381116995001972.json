South Korea Received 17 February 1995; accepted 3 August 1995 Abstract The hydrodechlorination reaction of dichlorodifluoromethane (CFZC12) has been studied under an atmospheric pressure at 130-210 over Pd/AIF3 catalyst. The effects of various reaction conditions on the catalyst performance in terms of the reaction rate and product distributions were extensively investigated and the adsorption behaviours of H2, CFzC12, CHFzCI, CHZFZ and CH3F on the catalyst surface are compared. In addition, the plausible reaction scheme has been proposed based on the experimental observations. Under the assumption that the formation of two main products, CHZFZ and CH, proceeds through the hydrogenation of intermediate species, CFz , , the reaction rate constants have been calculated by fitting the experimental data with the reaction rate expression.

Introduction Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been widely used as refrigerants, blowing agents, propellants or cleaning agents due to their outstanding properties such as stability, nontoxicity, nonflammablity, good thermodynamic properties and so on. However, production and use of CFCs are currently being phased out under international agreements, Montreal Protocol, because of global environmental concerns.

It would be particularly desirable if recovered CFCs can be converted to harmless and preferably to useful chemicals. Various technologies for treating CFCs before being released to air have been proposed in recent years. These technologies are mainly based on catalytic or non-catalytic decomposition processes. Catalytic decomposition technology includes oxidation [ 1,2], hydrolysis [3,4] and hydrogenation [5,6]. CFZC12 (CFC-12) may be catalytically transformed to CH 2 F2 (HFC-32) via hydrodechlorination. HFC-32 is thought to be one of the most promising candidates for 84 B.S. Ahn et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 106 (1996) 83-91 replacing CHF2CI (HCFC-22) which has been mainly used as low-temperature refrigerants. The reaction of CF2Cl2 with hydrogen has been studied by Du Pont Inc. at 500-700 over Pt, Ag, Co and Cu catalysts [7]. The maximum selectivity to CHFC12 and C2F4 was found to be 39%. Aida et al. [3] compared the performance of Au/A1203 and Au/C0304 catalyst for the decomposition of CF2C12. Au/A1203 was found to have a higher activity than Au/C0304. They concluded that Au/C0304 had only a high oxidation activity, while Au/A120.had both oxidation and hydrolysis activity. Coq et al. [5] studied the hydrogenation of CF2C12 in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure over Pd black and Pd supported on alumina, graphite, or AIF3, and found the highest selectivity to CH2F2 over Pd/AIF, catalyst. In this work, extensive experimental investigations on the hydrodechlorination reaction of CF2C12 have been carried out under an atmospheric pressure at 130-210 over Pd/AIF~; catalyst. The plausible reaction scheme has been proposed based on the experimental results and adsorption characteristics. The reaction rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data with the reaction rate expression. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation and characterizations of Pd l A1F3 catalyst A catalyst containing 3.45 wt.% of Pd on AIF~, was prepared by the conventional impregnation of AIF~3 with aqueous PdCl2 solution. The necessary amount of PdC12 was dissolved in 20 cm 3 of 0.1 N HO solution, and then it was added to 5 g of AIF3. The solution was evaporated at about 60 in a rotary evaporator for several hours. After drying at 120 overnight, the impregnated catalyst was calcinated at 450 in the electric furnace for 2-3 h. Prior to the reaction, the calcinated catalyst was reduced in situ in a hydrogen stream. The specific surface area of the catalyst were measured using an area meter Model II (Strohlein Instrument, Germany), which was a 20 19 7 12 U 15 ;~ Fig. 1.

Adsorption The adsorption experiments of H2, CF2C12, CHF20, CH2172, and CH3F were conducted in a conventional volumetric apparatus as shown in Fig. 1. A rotary vacuum pump and a diffusion pump were used to connect with the volumetric apparatus, and the liquid nitrogen trap was installed between the apparatus and the pumps for the removal of vaporized silicon oil. The pressure change during the adsorption step was measured by a pressure gauge (MKS Instruments, USA). After 0.3 g of catalyst was charged to the volumetric apparatus, the volume of the apparatus was measured using He gas. The reduction of catalyst was performed under the hydrogen flow of 20 cm 3/min at 300 for 1 h. After the reduction, adsorbed hydrogen was discharged through a vacuum line for 1 h. Then the apparatus was cooled to 150 to perform hydrogen chemisorption experiment. 4 1 4 3 s s CATALYST 5 5_ 85 The hydrogen of high purity grade at a certain pressure was introduced into the adsorption apparatus and the equilibrium pressure was measured after 30 min. Adsorbed hydrogen was discharged through a vacuum line for 1 h. And then, the hydrogen at a different pressure was introduced again and the same procedure was repeated. The adsorption equilibrium isotherm of hydrogen was determined from the adsorption amounts obtained for various pressures. In the same way, the adsorption isotherms were obtained for CF2C12, CHF2C1, CH2F2, and CH 3 F. 2.3. Reaction The reaction of CF2CI2 with hydrogen was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow system with a fixed-bed reactor made of nickel tube (0.3 m X 1 /2 in.). The schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. 0.25 g of Pd/AIF~3 catalyst was placed in the reactor. The catalyst was reduced in situ under flowing hydrogen (N2:30 cm 3/min, H2:15 cm 3/min) at 450 for 4 h. Before being sub- Fig. 2.

The Pd catalyst has been reported to undergo changes in activity and selectivity during the initial period of time in the hydrogenation reaction [5]. The flow rate of each reactant was controlled by mass flow controller (Matheson Model 8270). The effluent from the reactor was bubbled through a scrubber with 0.1 N NaOH solution to remove any HCl and HF formed, and then the remaining moisture was removed through a CaC12 dryer. Even though CHF2C1 has been known to be hydrolyzed in NaOH solution, the product gas composition was hardly affected by the hydrolysis in our experiments. The temperature of catalyst bed in the reactor was measured by a thermocouple and controlled with a precision of 1 by a temperature controller. The reaction products were analyzed using the gas chromatograph equipped with a Porapak Q column (2 m X 1 /8 in.) and the mass spectrometer equipped with a HP-1 capillary column (50 m X 0.2 mm). 3. Results and discussion The CF2C'2 hydrodechlorination reaction over Pd/AIF3 catalyst was investigated varying the reaction conditions such as feed composition, reaction temperature and so on. CF2C'2 + H2 -), products Considering that the dissociation energy of C-CI bond is known to be smaller than that of C-F bond [8], there is a possibility that the reaction proceeds through a consecutive scheme: CF2C12 _* CHF2C1--3, CH 2 F2 -), CH 3 F -4 CH 4 As a result of reaction, however, CH2F2 and CH4 were produced as major products, which usually occupied more than 90% of the total products. CHF2Cl and CH 3F, on the other hand, were detected only as trace amounts. 2.5 2.0 0.5 1.5 0.0 100 A 80 .m so A y k 1 ] P9c11 : 0.047 atm PH : 0.069 atm CH3C111 40 20 0 120 140 160 180 200 220 Temperature () Fig. 3. Effect of temperature on reaction rate and product selectivity in the hydrogenation of CF2C'2 over Pd//A1F3 catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the effects of the reaction temperature on the reaction rate and product distributions. It is readily seen that the reaction rate increased rapidly as the reaction temperature was raised from 130 to 210. With increasing the reaction temperature, CH 2 F2 was found to decrease slowly while CH 4 showed a maximum at 170. C2H6 increased gradually and reached to about 20% at 210. CH3C1 also held a small portion among all the products in a higher temperature. From these results in the product distributions with CF2C12 conversion (or reaction rate) change, it can be assumed that CH2 ; or CH 3 would be formed through the hydrogenation of CF2C12 on Pd surface and react with each other or Cl' to produce C2H6 or CH 3C1. In other words, it can be said that the main reaction in CF2C12 hydrodechlorination did not proceed through a consecutive scheme. Coq et al. [5] drew a similar conclusion and suggested the removal reactions of two halogen atoms during one sojourn at the catalyst surface: CF2C12 -3> CH 2F2; CHF2Cl --+ CH3F; CH2F2 --> CH4 In a way, the formation of byproduct, CH3C1, may be attributed to A1F3 used as support.

Effect of hydrogen pressure on reaction rate at various CFzCl2 pressure al 150 over Pd//AIF3 catalyst. CH 3C' can be obtained by F/Cl exchange from the intermediate product, CH 3F, on A1F? which has been reported to be a good catalyst in the preparation of CF3CFC12 from CFC12CF2Cl [9]. However, this effect can be neglected because of much lower reactivity on A1F3 than Pd surface. The activity of A1F~3 alone was found experimentally to be negligible for the hydrodechlorination reaction in the experimental range of 130-210. The effects of the feed composition on the overall reaction rate are shown in Fig. 4. The reaction rate had a maximum value at a specific hydrogen pressure for given CF2Cl2 pressures. This result indicates that there is competitive adsorption between CF2C12 and hydrogen on catalyst surface. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of hydrogen pressure on the CH2F2/CH4 ratio at various CF2C12 pressures. The CH 2 F2/CH 4 ratio showed a maximum value at a certain hydrogen pressure depending upon the CF2C12 pressure change, while it showed little change with change in CF2C12 pressures. Therefore, the reaction appeared to be more strongly influenced by hydrogen pressure rather than CF2C12 pressure. The adsorption experiments were also carried out in order to compare the adsorption ability of CF2Cl2 and hydrogen on the catalyst surface. 87 Fig. 5. Effect of hydrogen pressure on CH 2FZ /CH 4 product ratio of various CFZCI2 pressures at 150 over Pd//A1F3 catalyst. The adsorption equilibrium curves for reaction products as well as reactants were obtained as shown in Fig. 6. The order of adsorption ability was found to be HZ > CF2C12 > CHF2C1 > CH2F2 > CH, ,F. These results show that carbon-chlorine compounds were adsorbed more easily than carbon-fluorine compounds on the catalyst surface.

Comparison of isotherm models for CF2C'2 adsorption at 150 over Pd//A1F3 catalyst. adsorption models were compared with the ex perimental results. It was assumed in the first model that CF2C'2 was physically adsorbed to form CF2C12. Coq et al. [5] used a classical Langmuir-Hinshelwood model with competi tive adsorption of CF2Cl2 and H2 as a kinetic model, which involved this adsorption model. On the other hand, the second model it was assumed that CF2C12 was dissociatively ad sorbed to form CF2Cl * and the adsorbed CF2CI * was further dissociatively adsorbed to form CFZ * . As indicated in Fig. 7, the second model was found to be much better than the first model in predicting the adsorption behaviour of CF2C12. Based on the above experimental observations, a plausible reaction scheme modified from Coq's one [5] has been proposed as shown in CF2Ch /Pd Fig. 8. Since the major products of the reaction were found to be CH 2 F2 and CH 4, their formation was postulated to proceed through the hydrogenation of intermediate species such as CFZ , , CHF2*, CHF**, CH 2 * and so on. Since no appreciable amounts of CHF2C1 and CH3F were formed during the reaction, this postulation is more likely acceptable rather than the consecutive scheme of CF2C'2 -4 CHF2C1 -)- CH2F2 ---> CHEF --> CH4 In particular, CFZ , is regarded as a most important species among various intermediates in the proposed reaction scheme for the formation of CH 2 F2 and CH 4 by the hydrodechlorination of CF2C12' The reaction rate was calculated and compared with the experimental data under the assumption that other intermediate species, except for CF; * in Fig. 8, were consumed as soon as they were formed and the formation of two main products, CH 2 F2 and CH 4, was dependent only upon the hydrogenation rate of CFZ * . For simplicity, other reaction routes for the formation of CH 2 F2 and CH 4 were neglected in predicting the reaction rate of CF2CI2 hydrodechlorination. Thus, the assumptions adopted for this study can be summarized as follows. 1. CF2Cl2 and H2 are dissociatively adsorbed on catalyst surface. H2+2* -2H* CF2C'2 + 2 * CF2C1 * + C1 (2) 2.

The values of these parameters calculated are shown in Table 1. Fig. 9 and 10 illustrate the change in the surface coverage of each component depending upon the H2 and CF2C12 pressures at I50.

The formation of major products, CH2F2 and CHO can be ex- 0.5E-4 plained and estimated by the hydrogenation of intermediate species, CFZ * , rather than the con secutive scheme of CFZC12 -> CHFZCI --3- CH 2F2 -> CHI -~ CH 4 As shown in Fig. 8, CFZ , reacts with H * and 2H * to form CH 2 F2, CHF2*, CHF** and CH 2 , by paths 4-7. Since the reactions of H \" and 2H \" with CF;, have the rates of the same order of magnitude, and CHFz produces CH 2 F2 by path 9 as well as CHF.* by path 10, it was difficult to estimate the CH2F2/CH4 product ratio. 4. Conclusion The major products of CF2CI2 hydrodechlo rination reaction was found to be CH2F2 and CH 4. The competitive behaviours between CF2Cl2 and H2 during the reaction was con firmed from the experimental results and ad sorption characteristics. In predicting the ad sorption behaviour of CF2C12 on Pd surface, the model for dissociative adsorption with the for mation of CF2C1 '\" and CFZ , was found to be -j 1.0E-4 superior to the model for physical adsorption. The formation of the products could be ex plained by the direct hydrogenation of interme diate species, CF? , , rather than by the consecu tive scheme of CF2C12 _+ CHF2Cl --> CH2F2 -+ CH3 -4 CH4 A reaction scheme for the CF2C12 hydrodechlorination was proposed and the overall reaction rate expression derived from the scheme was confirmed experimentally to describe the reaction well.

(+82-2)9585854, Fax. (+82-2)9585809. The hydrodechlorination reaction of dichlorodifluoromethane (CF2Cl2) has been studied under an atmospheric pressure at 130–210°C over Pd AlF3 catalyst. The effects of various reaction conditions on the catalyst performance in terms of the reaction rate and product distributions were extensively investigated and the adsorption behaviours of H2, CF2Cl2, CHF2Cl, CH2F2 and CH3F on the catalyst surface are compared. In addition, the plausible reaction scheme has been proposed based on the experimental observations. Under the assumption that the formation of two main products, CH2F2 and CH4, proceeds through the hydrogenation of intermediate species, CF∗2∗, the reaction rate constants have been calculated by fitting the experimental data with the reaction rate expression.
