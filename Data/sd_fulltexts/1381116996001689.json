The CH3-bridged cation [((CSHS)ZZrCH3)Z(w-CH3)]+, solvent-separated from the anion HOC-B(C6F5)3 , is present in equilibrium with (CSHS)2Zt(CH3)Z and the mononuclear ion pair [(CSHS)2ZrCH3 . . . H3C-B(C6F5)3 ]; in more concentrated solutions, a binuclear ion pair [((CSHS)zZrCH3)2(w-CH3)+ H3CB(C6F5)3 ] is the dominant species. Similar equilibria are observed in CA solutions containing B(C6F5)3 and (CH3)QCZ(CSHQ)2Zr(CH3)2, (CH3)zSi(CSH4)zZr(CH3)2 or rac-(CH3)ZSi(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2. Complexes with sterically more demanding ligands, such as (CS(CH3)5)2Zr(CH3)2 or rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl-benz[e]indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 do not form any binuclear species under these conditions. In the catalyst system rac-(CH3)Zsi(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2/Bu3NH+B(C6F5)4, activities for the polymerization of propene increase with excess of the dimethyl zirconocene complex. This effect is due in part to a sacrifice of some dimethyl zirconocene for the removal of impurities from the catalyst system and in part to a stabilization of the catalyst in the form of the binuclear cation [((CH3)Zsi(indenyl)ZZrCH3)2(w-CH3)]+. The latter appears to act, in the presence of propene, as a source of the mononuclear cation [(CH3)zSi(indenyl)ZZrCH3(C3H6)]+, rather than as a polymerization catalyst by itself.

Introduction The generation of active olefin polymerization catalysts from zirconocene dialkyl complexes by reaction with a strong Lewis acid, A, is generally considered to involve equilibria between the dialkyl complex (C5H5)2ZrR2 and its Lewis-acid adduct (C5H5)2Zr(R)R - A, which is equivalent to a contact ion pair between a zir- ` Corresponding author.

Beck et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 67-79 More recently, evidence has been obtained that binuclear cations of the type [((CSHS)ZMCH3)2(ji-CH3)]+ (M = Ti, Zr, Th) can occur in reaction media containing metallocene alkyl cations [7-10]. The presence of binuclear complexes has been inferred also from the effects of excess zirconocene dimethyl complex on the properties of catalyst systems containing (CH3)ZSi(indenyl)ZZr(CH3)2 and nBu3NH+B(C6F5)4 [11]. Here, we present results of studies on NMR-spectral and catalytic properties of related reaction systems, aimed at a further characterization of binuclear zirconocene cations, at a delineation of the conditions under which they are formed and at a clarification of their effects on the properties of zirconocene catalyst systems. 2. Experimental The zirconium complexes (CSHS)ZZrC12 [12], (CH 3)4C 2(C SH 4)ZZrC12 [13], Me 2Si(CSHS)ZZrC12 [14,15], racMe2Si(ind)ZZrC12 [16,17], and (CS(CH3)5)ZZXC12 [18] were converted to the respective dimethyl compounds by reaction with 2 equivalents of CH3Li in ether solution at - 78; after warming to room temperature, the solutions were stirred for another 30 min and then evaporated to dryness. The dimethyl complexes were obtained by extraction with pentane and crystallization at low temperatures [19]. For the conversion of rac-Me2Si(2-Mebenz[e]ind)ZZrC12 [20,21] to the dimethyl derivative, this procedure was modified in that toluene was used as a solvent both for the reaction with CH3Li and for the extraction of the dimethyl complex. B(C6F5)3 was obtained as described by Pohlmann et al. [22]. All materials were kept and handled in a glovebox under Nz. C6136 was purified by stirring over potas- 0 sium metal, degassed, condensed onto a 4 A molecular sieve and then stored in a glovebox under exclusion of light. Stock solutions containing 0.01 or 0.04 mol/L of each of the zirconium complexes or of B(C6F5)3 in CA were used for the preparation of the solutions studied. 1 H-NMR spectra of the solutions studied were measured on a Bruker WM-250 spectrometer. In a series of control experiments, hydrolysis and photolysis reactions of sample solutions were purposely induced. The absence of any signals assignable to the hydrolysis or photolysis products thus observed was used to monitor the integrity of the reactions systems investigated in this study. The propene polymerization reactions were conducted under the conditions described in Ref. [10]; polymerization rates were measured by the rate of propene uptake. The rates shown in Figs. 5-7 represent maximal activities, which were reached, in general, 5-10 min after the start of each catalysis reaction. 3. Results 3.1. CH3 bridged binuclear cations from zir conocene dimethyl complexes and B(C6 FS) j Because of its NMR-spectral simplicity, we consider first the reaction system (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)2/B(C6F5)3 [23,24]. The 1HNMR signals expected for the contact ion pair [(C5H5)ZZrCH3 . . . H3C-B(C6F5)3 ] are observed in dbenzene solutions containing ca. 0.05 mol/L of (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)2 and a slight excess of B(C6F5)3 (B:Zr = 1.2:1) (Fig. 1, Table 1): A singlet for the terminal CH 3 group at 8 0.28 ppm and a broad signal at 8 0.14 ppm for the Zr . . . CH 3-B bridge indicate that exchange between terminal and bridging CH 3 groups is slow on the NMR time scale. Higher exchange rates have been observed with related complexes at more elevated temperatures [25-27]. The signals of this ion pair decrease in intensity when (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)2 is added at Zr:B ratios above 1:1.

For this latter complex, terminal and bridging CH 3 groups were found to exchange rapidly at room temperature; such an exchange is obviously slow for the binuclear zirconocene cation [((CSHS)2ZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)]+. The counter-anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 , formed together with this binuclear cation, gives a broad singlet at 8 1.3 ppm. These and further data, to be discussed below, indicate the formation of a solvent-sep- arated binuclear alkyl zirconocene cation according to equilibrium reaction (3). I(C5H5)2zr(CH3)+ - - .

(3) A still higher excess of (CSHS)2Zr(CH3)2 does not cause the signals of this binuclear cation to grow any further (Fig. 1). Instead we observe, at Zr:B ratios above ca. 1.6:1, increasing proportions of another binuclear cation, likewise of composition [((C~HS)2ZrCH3)2(1,CH3)]+, as indicated by its signals at 8 5.52, - 0.19, and -1.32 ppm, again with an integral C5H5 Me-B Zr-Me Zr-Me-Zr Dim-S Dim-A Dim-A ZrMe2 CIP Dim-S CIP Dim-S Dim-S Dim-A ~ Dim-A 2:1 L0 0,0 -1.0 PP.

Designation of zirconocene species involved: Dim-S, solvent-separated binuclear cation; Dim-A, associated binuclear ion pair; CIP, mononuclear contact ion pair; ZrMe2, zirconocene dimethyl complex. S. Beck et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 67-79 ratio of 20:6:3. This species becomes predominant in solutions with Zr:B ratios >_ 1.7:1; here, the appearance of the signals of (C5HS)2Zr(CH 3)2 at 8 5.70 and - 0.12 ppm indicate that reaction (3) approaches completion. An additional, broadened signal at 8 1.0 ppm associated with this second binuclear cation is assigned to its counter-anion H3C-B(C6F5)3. The chemical shift of this signal is close to that of 8 0.85 ppm observed for Li' ' ' ' H3CB(C6F5)3 (generated by dissolving solid LiCH3 and B(C 6 FS) 3 in CA), rather than to that of 8 1.3 ppm for the first of the binuclear species discussed above. This suggests that the species dominating at higher Zr:B ratios represents an associated ion pair containing the binuclear cation in contact with its borate counter-anion, [((CSHS)ZZrCH3)24ii,-CH3)+ . . . H3C- B(C6Fs)3 ]. When solutions containing (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)2 and B(C6F5)3 in a ratio of Zr:B = 2:1 are diluted with C6D6, the signals of the solvent-sep- 40 35 30 25 ,2 20 c l5 U 10 '5 m 0 Dim-ASS 0 0 ,, CpzZrMe2 - ~--o ,o Dim-Solv CIP 10 20 30 40 50 [ Zr ]t / mm Fig. 2.

H3C-B(C6F5)3 ] at a [Zrl:[B] ratio of 2:1, in % of the total zirconocene concentration. Symbols as in Fig. 1. 71 crated binuclear canon gain in weight while those assigned to the associated species gradually diminish (Fig. 2). At total zirconocene concentrations of [Zr]t ca. 10-2 mol/L, as they are typically employed in zirconocene-catalyzed polymerization reactions, only the solvent-separated binuclear complex remains in significant concentrations. As the signals of the individual species present under these conditions do not change over a period of up to one hour, we can assume that the individual complexes are in equilibrium with each other. As expected for equilibrium reaction (3), changes in total zirconocene concentrations leave the relative concentrations of the individual species practically unaffected (Fig. 2). From their relative ' H-NMR intensities, we determine for this equilibrium a value of K3 = 1.0 0.2. This value indicates that (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)2 and H3C-B(C6F5)3 have similar Lewis basicities toward the canon (CSHS)ZZr(CH3)+. Efforts to obtain crystals of a binuclear zirconocene complex have not been successful so far. Solutions containing a 1:2 mixture of B(C6F5)3 and a zirconocene dimethyl complex tend to deposit oily precipitates upon cooling or evaporation. When such a solution of B(C6F5)s and (CH3)4C2(CSHa)ZZr(CH3)2 In CHZC12 was slowly evaporated at - 40, the oily precipitate contained some crystalline material. A crystal structure analysis showed that these crystals contained the mononuclear ion pair [(CH3)4C2(CSH4)ZZr(CH3)+ . . . H3C-B_ (C6F5)3 ] (Fig. 3, Table 2). Apparently, this species happens to crystallize more readily than the binuclear ion pair in equilibrium with it. The structure of this ion pair, especially the near-linear Zr-CH 3-B geometry, with three close Zr-H contacts, are in accord with previous studies on related ion-pair complexes [26,28]. For the bridging Zr-CH 3-Zr group of the binuclear [((CSHS)ZZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)]+ canon we find a coupling constant of J(tH, t3C) = 136 Hz in CDC13 solution at -45. Values of J(tH, 13C) = 135-140 Hz are typically observed for binuclear complexes with metal- 72 S.

CH3-metal bridges and indicate that the w-CH3 unit is close to a planar, sp2-hybridized geometry [7,9,29]. With regard to the identity of the second C3 C2~ C8 3-bridged species, the dependence of its con- centration profile on total zirconocene concentration (Fig. 2) indicates that this species arises from an association of the type represented in Eq.

(4) With regard to the binding of the H3CB(C6F5)3 anion in such an associated ion pair, our data do not allow to distinguish between a fluctuation of the H3C-B(C6F5)3 anion and a symmetrical bonding of the H3C-B(C6F5)3 anion to both Zr centers, which would then acquire a formal coordination number of 5.

H3C-B(C6F5)3 ]. The binuclear cation [((CSHS)2ZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)]+ thus appears to be much less electrophilic than the putative mononuclear cation [(CSHS)2Zr(CH3)]+, which is most likely incapable of existing per se.

H3C-B(C6F5)3 ] (Table 1). Four separate ring hydrogen and two separate (CH3)4C2 and (CH3)ZSi signals indicate that CH3 and H3C-B(C6F5)3 ligands do not exchange coordination sites rapidly in these complexes at room temperature. A n increasing excess of (CH3)4C2(CSH4)ZZr(CH3)2 over B(C6F5)3 generates Zr-(p,-CH3)-Zr signals at 8 -0.71 and - 0.92 ppm for (CH 3)4C 2 bridged and at -0.50 and -0.90 ppm for (CH3)ZSi-bridged complexes. Broadened H3C-B(C6F5)3 signals at 8 + 1.3 and + 1.0 ppm are typical, in both reaction systems, for the solvent-separated and associated pairs of binuclear cations and H3CB(C6F5)3 anions, respectively, as discussed above. Other signals of these complexes are not well resolved; their detailed interpretation is thwarted by superposition of multiple signal sets due to several species in the region between 5 and 6.5 ppm. Essentially analogous observations are made w ith the reaction system racMe2Si(ind)ZZr(CH3)2/B(C6F5)3 (Table 1). As previously observed by Bochmann and coworkers in CDZC12 solution at - 60 [9], a doubling of the number of their ' H-NMR signals indicates the formation of diastereomeric dimers from R- and S-configurated ansa-metallocene units. Even for these substituted ansa-metallocene systems, we observe comparable amounts of solvent-separated and of associated binuclear cations in 2.7 - 10-2 M solutions in CA at 25. Estimates of K3 = 2 and of K4 - 0.8 - 103 (mol/L)-' indicate that the formation of these binuclear cations is affected only in a minor way by the introduction of indenyl instead of cyclopentadienyl ligands. With the permethylated complex (CS(CH3)s)zZr(CH3)2, on the other hand, we observe only the formation of a B(C6F5)3 adduct, i.e. of the mononuclear contact ion pair [(CS(CH3)5)ZZrCH3 . . . H3C-B(C6F5)3 ] with signals at 8 1.38, 0.30, and - 0.16 ppm, with an integrated intensity ratio of 30:3:3. Even in the presence of excess (CS(CH3)5)ZZr(CH3)2, only the signals of this B(C6F5)3 adduct are apparent, together w ith those of (C5(CH3)5)ZZr(CH3)2 at 8 1.76 and -0.55 ppm. Signals assignable to a binuclear cation are not detectable under these conditions. A binuclear cation, analogous to the thorium complex [((CS(CH3)5)ZThCH3)2(R-CH3)]+ [7], is apparently incompatible with the small size of the Zr(IV) center vis-a-vis the steric demands of the permethylated ring ligands. Similarly, no signals assignable to a binuclear cation are observed in the reaction system rac-Me2Si(2-Mebenz[e]ind)ZZr(CH3)2/B(C6F5)3. Here, again, the steric demands of the extended benzindenyl ligand system appear to prevent the close approach of two Zr centers required for the formation of a C143-bridged binuclear cation. 3.2. Polymerization of propene with the catalyst system M e2 Si(Ind)2 Zr(CH3 )2 / nBu3 NH +B(C6 FS )a The kinetics of propene polymerization in the catalyst system formed from rac-dimethylsilylbis(indenyl)zirconium dimethyl and the cationgenerating reagent tris-n-butylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate was investigated, especially with regard to the dependence of the rate of polymerization on the catalyst concentration, the dimethyl-metallocene/ammonium-borate ratio and the polymerization temperature. In this way, we have tried to clarify how the formation of the binuclear zirconocene cation [(MeZSi(Ind)ZZrCH3)2('CH3)]+ affects the catalytic activity in these reaction systems. 3.3. Effects of the total catalyst concentration on the rate of propene polymerization Fig. 4 represents the rate of polymerization as a function of the initial catalyst concentration, determined at a 1:1 ratio of dimethyl metallocene to ammonium borate. It is apparent that a small change in concentration causes a remarkable increase in the rate of polymerization. Cat- 75 50 40 30 zo 10 VP * 104 moU (1 s) 0 0 O t S.

This indicates that the catalyst system is totally deactivated up to a limiting catalyst concentration, presumably by impurities. This deactivation is, in fact, di rectly observable by a decoloration of the light yellow reaction mixture of dimethyl metal locene and ammonium borate after its injection into the solvent-filled reactor. The limiting catalyst concentration, which just allows a significant polymerization activity to be observed, must depend on the purity of all substances used as well as on the cleanliness of to the reactor system. For the present series of experiments, it has a value of ca. 1.15 ~ 10-4 mol/L. This quantity corresponds to a sacrifi- cial consum ption, either of Me2Si(ind)ZZr(CH3)2 or of an ion-pair com plex such as [Me2Si(Ind)ZZrCH 3 B(C6F5)4 ], which is required to free the reaction system of adventitious inhibitors. That the catalytically active species per se is highly reactive is apparent from the strong increase in activities observed when catalyst concentrations are increased above the limiting value. At total catalyst concentrations exceeding 1.3 ~ 10-4 mol/L activities are so high that the temperature of the reaction system becomes difficult to control. Reproducible rate measurements are thus limited to catalyst concentrations in the narrow range between 1.15 and 1.3 ~ 10-4 mol/L. 3.4. Effects of the ammonium-borate / dimethylmetallocene ratio on the rate of propene polymerization In this series of experiments, catalytic activities were determined at a constant initial Me2Si(ind)ZZr(CH3)Z concentration of 1.31 10-4 mol/L and varying concentrations of nBu3NH+B(C6F5)4 (Fig. 5). It is apparent that incomplete addition of ammonium borate as well as its addition excess over metallocene has a negative effect on the rate of polymerization, which goes through a maximum close to VP * 104 .11(1 .s) ao 30 zo 0 0 0 1.5 2 2.5 [Ammonlumborate] / [Metallocene] Fig. 5.

The shape of the curve in Fig. 5 shows that decreased concentrations of ammonium borate result in an over-proportional decrease in the rates of polymerization. This effect is most likely caused by the fact that under these conditions the absolute concentrations of catalyst are de creased to and finally beyond the minimal threshold value discussed above. Only the ex cess of metallocene present in these cases ex plains that finite polymerization activities are still observable at these low catalyst concentra tions, where a 1:1 mixture of ammonium borate and dimethyl metallocene would result in no activities at all. The loss of polymerization rate caused by an excess of cation-generating reagent, on the other hand, could be explained either by a deactivat ing interaction of the tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate anion with the metallocene cation [9] or, possibly, by a pro tolytic elimination of the second Zr -bound methyl group by excess tributyl ammonium ion. 3.5. Effects of the dimethyl-metallocene / ammonium-borate ratio on the rate of propene polymerization In this series, the initial concentration of n-Bu3NH+B(C6F5)4 was kept constant at 8.5 10-5 mol/L; Me2Si(ind)ZZr(CH3)2 was added in excess with Zr:B ratios in the range of 1:1 to 4:1. From Fig. 6 it is evident that a measurable rate of polymerization requires at least a Zr:B ratio of 1.2:1, i.e. an absolute zirconocene con centration close to the threshold value deter mined above. Beyond this Zr:B ratio, the rate of polymerization increases steadily with increas ing excess of dimethyl metallocene. The activity increase up to a Zr:B ratio of 2.2:1 is explained by the sacrificial consumption of ca. 1.1 ~ 10-4 mol/L of MeZSi(ind)ZZr(CH3)2 for the removal of some inhibitors) and the subsequent stoichiometric generation of the catalytically active contact ion so do 30 zo to - 0 + 13 0 3.5 4 [Metallaceney[Aumrouiumborate] Fig. 6.

As these reactions are complete at a Zr:B ratio of ca. 2.2:1, activities would be expected to level off at higher dimethyl-metallocene/ammonium-borate ratios. The continued activity increase observed at Zr:B ratios up to 3.6:1 thus requires another explanation. From preceding studies [7-10] and from our present ' H-NMR data on this reaction system it is clear that an excess of dimethyl metallocene will induce formation of the binuclear, cationic metallocene complex [(Me2 Si(Ind) 2 ZrCH 3) 2( N1CH3)]+. Although the anion B(C6F5)4 instead of H3C-B(C6F5)3 represents the counter-anion in the contact ion pair [Me2Si(ind)ZZrCH3 B(C6F5)4 ] generated in this system, a binuclear canon [Me2Si(ind)ZZrCH3)2(w-CH3)]+ identical to that discussed above will certainly be formed by excess Me2Si(ind)ZZr(CH3)2 from this contact ion pair. As the zirconocene concentrations in these catalyst systems are only ca. S. Beck et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 67-79 10-4 mol/L, association of the binuclear cation with its counter-anion is unlikely to be of any significance. We can thus assume that equilibrium reaction (5) describes the species present, before the addition of olefin, in reaction systems containing an excess of Me2Si(ind)2Zr(CH3)2. [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3 B(C6F5)4 + Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 [(Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3)2(w-CH3)] + + B(C6F5)4 The question then arises whether such a binuclear cation might represent an additional catalyst species, which induces polymer growth at a higher rate than a mononuclear cation. This hypothesis is not supported, however, by the analytical data of the polymers produced with these catalyst systems: Their molar masses and mass distributions as well as their isotacticities remain invariant against the variation of the dimethyl-metallocene/ammonium-borate ratio in this series of experiments (Tables 3 and 4). This indicates that only a single catalyst species contributes to polymer formation, irrespective of the dimethyl-metallocene/ammonium-borate ratio used.

At any rate, binuclear canons of the type [(Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)]+ do not appear to contribute in any way to chain growth termination, as the molar mass of the polymer products remains unchanged in the presence of excess Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2, i.e. under conditions where these binuclear canons are the predominant species. The beneficial effects which the formation of a binuclear cation such as [(Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)]+ is found to have on the activities of these catalyst systems might instead result from an increased stability of the catalyst system against deactivation. Reaction of the mononuclear ion pair with dimethyl metallocene according to Eq. (5) is likely to decrease the strong electrophilicity of the metallocene canon. Such a species might thus be stabilized against deactivating side reactions, while still being an efficient source of the reactive cationic olefin com plex [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3 ~ ~ ~ (C 3H6)]+ according to Eq. (6). [(Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3)2(p,-CH3)] ++ C3H6 [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCH3(C3H6)I + + Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2. (6) While an increase in the steady-state concentration of the essential polymer-bearing cation [Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(Pol)]+ is likely to be caused by its protective association w ith 78 S. Beck et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 111 (1996) 67-79 Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH3)z, a net increase in the rate of polymerization is to be expected only if this stabilizing effect outweighs the reduced tendency of the resulting binuclear complex to form the `productive' cation [Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(Pol)(C3H6)]+ by coordination of propene. Observations by Bochmann and Lancaster [30] on the reduced stability of binuclear cations with p,-ethyl instead of [,-methyl bridges suggest that increasing lengths of the Zr-bound polymer chain will indeed render the resulting binuclear species increasingly prone to cleavage by an olefin. In the absence of any direct information on the equilibrium constants for the reactions involved, i.e. of equilibria analogous to reactions (5) and (6) but with a polymer chain in place of the Zr-bound methyl group, we must forgo a more detailed analysis of the ways in which the formation of binuclear cations brings about the increase in polymerization rates represented in Fig. 6. It appears certain, however, that the increased rate of polymerization caused by an excess of Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 in the reaction system is due to some protective effects associated with the presence of binuclear, alkyl-bridged cations. 3.6.

Fig. 7 shows a strong decrease of the rates of polymerization in the region between 15 and 45; at 55 activities had totally disappeared. The analytical data of the polymers obtained at these temperatures show the expected decrease in molar mass but rather constant molar mass dispersities and microstructures (Tables 5 and 6). This indicates that the species responsible for polymer growth remain the same in this temperature range.

The reason for the decrease of activity is undoubtedly the thermal instability of the catalyst system. Again, the deactivation is directly observable by the decoloration of the light yellow reaction solution in the reactor. At a reaction temperature of 55 the pre-reacted orange-brown catalyst solution is decolored immediately after injection into the solvent-filled reactor; at 45 a weak light yellow coloration remains only for a few minutes. At 15, a decrease in color intensity is practically undetectable. These observations underline that the overall activities accessible for these `cationic' catalysts are crucially limited by their susceptibility to deactivation. Activities in these catalyst systems are thus likely to benefit from the stabilizing effects associated with the formation of less electrophilic binuclear canons.

Fax: (+49-7531) 883137. Binuclear zirconocene cations are observed by 1H-NMR in C6D6 solutions containing B(C6F5)3 and an excess of a zirconocene dimethyl complex. The CH3-bridged cation [((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(μ-CH3)]+, solvent-separated from the anion H3CB(C6F5)− 3, is present in equilibrium with (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)2 and the mononuclear ion pair [(C5H5)2ZrCH+ 3 … H3CB(C6F5)− 3]; in more concentrated solutions, a binuclear ion pair [((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(μ-CH3)+ … H3CB(C6F5)− 3] is the dominant species. Similar equilibria are observed in C6D6 solutions containing B(C6F5)3 and (CH3)4C2(C5H4)2Zr(CH3)2, (CH3)2Si(C5H4)2Zr(CH3)2 or rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2. Complexes with sterically more demanding ligands, such as (C5(CH3)5)2Zr(CH3)2 or rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl-benz[e]indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 do not form any binuclear species under these conditions. In the catalyst system rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2Bu3NH+B(C6F5)− 4, activities for the polymerization of propene increase with excess of the dimethyl zirconocene complex. This effect is due in part to a sacrifice of some dimethyl zirconocene for the removal of impurities from the catalyst system and in part to a stabilization of the catalyst in the form of the binuclear cation [((CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3)2(μ-CH3)]+. The latter appears to act, in the presence of propene, as a source of the mononuclear cation [(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3(C3H6)]+, rather than as a polymerization catalyst by itself.
