Graphical abstract Cobalt nanoparticles decorated nitrogen doped graphene was synthesized by utilizing both electrodes of lithium cobalt oxide based spent battery, which exhibit exceptional activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction in direct methanol fuel cell. Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (SLIBs) has become essential to preserve the environment and reclaim vital resources for sustainable development. The typical SLIBs recycling concentrated on separating valuable components had limitations, including high energy consumption and complicated separation processes. This work suggests a safe hydrometallurgical process to recover usable metallic cobalt from depleted LiCoO2 batteries by utilizing citric acid as leachant and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, with ethanol as a selective precipitating agent. The anode graphite was also recovered and converted to graphene oxide (GO). The above components were directly resynthesized to cobalt-integrated nitrogen-doped graphene (Co@NG).The Co@NG showed a decent activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential of 0.880 V vs. RHE, almost similar to Pt/C (0.888 V vs. RHE) and with an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE. The metal-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-C) having the highest nitrogen content has decreased the barrier for ORR since the reaction was enhanced for Co@NG-800, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The Co@NG cathode catalyst coupled with commercial Pt-Ru/C as anode catalyst exhibits excellent performance for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with a peak power density of 34.7 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 120 mA cm−2 and decent stability, indicating the promising utilization of spent battery materials in DMFC applications. Besides, lithium was recovered from supernatant as lithium carbonate by coprecipitation process. This work avoids sophisticated elemental separation by utilizing SLIBs for other renewable energy applications, lowering the environmental concerns associated with recycling. Keywords Density functional theory (DFT) Direct methanol fuel cell Leaching Nitrogen doping Oxygen reduction reaction Recycling Spent lithium-ion batteries 1 Introduction Lithium-ion batteries are not only energy storage systems that have already acquired broad adoption as a preferred platform in electronics products and stationary energy storage applications but also are a success factor in the global boom in electric vehicles (EVs). The International Energy Agency estimated 140 million electric cars will be in 2030 if the Paris climate agreement takes effect [1]. With an increase in electric and hybrid vehicles on the road, the market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow rapidly. The lithium-ion batteries have a maximum life of about 7 to 10 years due to irreversible electrochemical reactions during the charge–discharge cycles, mechanical damage, binder degradation, metal oxide dissolution, and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) outgrowth [2]. About 11 million tons of spent lithium-ion batteries (SLIBs) are expected to reach an ecosystem by 2030. This massive e-waste motivated researchers and industry to develop appropriate reutilizing systems for valuable materials, but only 5% of the amount recycled so far [3]. The SLIBs are classified as hazardous wastes and are subject to strict international disposal regulations because they contain considerable amounts of heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) and organic wastes. As a result, recycling SLIBs is a great approach to utilizing valuable metals while protecting the environment. This is particularly necessary for cobalt-based LIBs, which contain high levels of the pricey cobalt [4]. A majority of the cobalt supplier for the world is the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which the mining process relies on informal mines, which resulted in multiple injuries and deaths caused by the collapse of haphazardly dug tunnels and frequent child labor [5]. The natural abundance and uneven global distribution of lithium-containing precursors also pose inevitable challenges to the battery industry. Therefore, effective lithium recovery is also crucial to stabilize the lithium supply chain for sustainable development in the LIBs sector [6]. Energy consumption, greenhouse gases, and sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced significantly by recycling SLIBs compared with producing them from virgin materials [7,8]. Therefore, recycling SLIBs is crucial for resource utilization, protection of the environment, and monetary benefits. Three fundamental techniques are used to recover valuable minerals from SLIBs: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct recycling. The first two of these procedures share a necessary physical step, such AS mechanical separation, dissolution, or heat treatment. Large-scale recycling can be achieved through pyrometallurgical processes (thermal treatment). However, it suffers from high energy consumption, inadequate lithium recycling efficiency, and the emission of poisonous gasses [9]. Direct recycling is a potential method for repairing the structure of the damaged cathode particles through a straightforward procedure without harming the bulk phase [10]. In hydrometallurgical treatments, metals are leached out from cathode materials using aqueous solutions of either acids or bases. The common hydrometallurgical process uses inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or nitric acid as leaching agents and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. These strong acids are costly, can corrode the materials used in the process and generate hazardous waste, posing environmental and safety risks [11]. The biohydrometalurgical process recovers metals from SLIBs using bacteria, which is reasonably affordable but requires significant labor and time. Hydrometallurgy is also a decent approach with low-energy consumption, high selectivity and a high recovery rate [12]. It has been attempted to improve the selectivity of leaching operations to recover individual metal components (e.g., Mn, Ni, Co) [11]. In the common leaching process, the lithium concentration is very low as it needs more energy to concentrate before the co-precipitation process. Lithium is also scattered among various separation and refining phases, resulting in a lengthy separation method with limited lithium recovery [13]. Selective leaching and downstream separation methods are required to improve recovery rates and final product purity. Previous reports suggest a combined use of leaching followed by additional purification processes using selective precipitation/extraction techniques as an appealing strategy [14]. The development of advanced catalysts from SLIBs for various applications has recently gained greater interest due to the presence of transition metal elements (e.g., Co, Mn, and Ni) and highly conductive graphite in them [15,16]. For instance, spent LiFePO4 and graphite were developed to composite LiFePO4/graphite with the ability to store cations and anions and studied for a dual-ion battery application [17]. Mei et al. synthesized Fe2O3/CoPi from spent LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 cathodes for water splitting by oxalic acid leaching, electrodeposition, and subsequent calcination [18]. Waste NCM cathodes were resynthesized to NiMnCo as an ORR/OER catalyst for zinc-air batteries [19]. Mao et al. regenerated Co3O4 microspheres using the leaching solution SLIBs by subsequent solvothermal and calcination and studied it for supercapacitor applications [20].Kim and his group investigated the catalytic activity of recovered Co3O4/rGO from used LiCoO2 towards ORR and MOR [21]. Schiavi and colleagues developed an asymmetric supercapacitor from core-shell nanowires made with electrodeposition using electrolytic solutions recovered from the SLIBs cathode (Co, Ni) and recovered graphite [22]. Liu and colleagues developed a composite cobalt nitride-graphene (CoN-Gr) catalyst from spent LiCoO2 and studied it for water electrolysis [23]. Natarajan et al. recycled mixed cathode (LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4) to MnCo2O4 spheres, and anode graphite was converted into reduced graphene oxide, both then studied for asymmetric supercapacitor [24]. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have gained much interest as a potential alternative energy conversion technology because of their comparatively high specific energy, low working temperature, and minimal pollutant emissions [25]. DMFC is one of the most promising power alternatives that can convert the chemical energy of tiny organic molecule fuel (methanol) into electricity through electrochemical processes [26]. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity must be enhanced to achieve high power density fuel cells, which requires effective catalysts [29]. The cathode of low-temperature fuel cells predominantly comprises platinum (Pt) and Pt-based catalysts, which are rare and costly [27]. For commercializing DMFC, replacing Pt-based cathode catalysts with nonprecious metal catalysts is needed to decrease overall device cost [28]. Another downside of Pt-based catalysts is that they are intolerant to methanol crossover, which lowers fuel cell performance and stability [29]. Due to these drawbacks of Pt-based materials, significant effort has been made to develop novel Pt-free electrode materials for the ORR in alkaline environments. Different carbon-based materials with affordable cost, availability and increased chemical stability have been eye-catching research interests in electrocatalysis [30]. In the past, it has been recognized that transition metals catalysts can be made more conductive by doping them with electron donors or using conductive support materials, such as N-doped graphene. Metal–nitrogen–carbon (M−N−C) materials are one of the most attractive non-noble metal ORR catalysts so far, and they can compete with standard Pt/C catalysts [31,32]. High porous carbon-based catalysts improve ORR by facilitating oxygen adsorption, which enhances mass transport and overall electron transfer [33]. Undoubtedly, good electrical and ionic conductivity, tolerance of methanol crossover and structural stability also have a major impact on the performance of the electrode materials [34]. Herein, we recycled both cathode and anodes of spent LiCoO2-based batteries by an eco-friendly hydrometallurgical method and used it to synthesize efficient ORR catalysts. The spent LiCoO2 leached with citric acid (2 M) with 7% H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. The solvent and excess leaching agents (acid and oxidant) were recycled by precipitating cobalt ions using 30% (v/v) ethanol. The supernatant solvent was used for the second time which raised lithium concentration, enhancing the recovery efficiency. The anode graphite was directly converted to graphene oxide (GO) using a modified hummer's process. The precipitated cobalt and GO were used to resynthesize cobalt-integrated nitrogen-doped graphene (Co@NG). Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) is used as a nitrogen source and reducing agent in a single-step thermochemical reduction technique. Electrocatalytic measurements in alkaline solution revealed that the Co@NG showed promising activities towards ORR, with Co@NG-800 (synthesized at 800 °C) exhibiting the highest performance in terms of the half-wave potential of 0.880 V vs. RHE, comparable to commercial Pt/C (E 1/2 = 0.888 V). The Co@NG-800 cathode with Pt-Ru/C anode employed for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) displayed an open circuit voltage of 0.76 V and a peak power density of 34.7 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 120 mA cm−2. This work achieves high-value waste utilization and environmental preservation by turning waste into a highly effective ORR catalyst. Such recycling SLIBs towards advanced electrocatalyst applications would be a one-stone–two-birdsstrategy. 2 Experimental All the reagents were analytical grade and utilized without further purification. 2.1 Pretreatment, dismantling, and recovery of valuable components The SLIBs gathered from phone repair shops were thoroughly drained in a 5% sodium chloride solution to eliminate potential explosion and fire threats from residual power. After manual disassembly, the cathode, anode, polypropylene or polyethylene separators, steel casing, and plastic package were separated. The active cathode material was later collected from the aluminum current collector with the assistance of ultrasonic bath sonication using N, N dimethylformamide (DMF) for 1 h. The black cathode was later calcined in an air atmosphere for 2 h at 600 °C to remove the residue binder and conductive carbon. For the lixiviation process, the cathode powder was placed in a 250 mL flask containing citric acid as a leaching agent (2 M) and hydrogen peroxide (7 vol%) as an oxidizing agent. Initially, 20 g L-1 of the solution was prepared and sonicated at 70 °C until complete leaching was achieved after 45 min. Once the leaching was completed, different liquid ratios of 10%, 20%, and 30% (v/v) of ethanol (96%) were added to the leachate solution and stirred for 5 min. The cobalt ions precipitated, and a clear supernatant solution was obtained at 30 vol% ethanol. This clear solution was then transferred to another beaker to be used again for the subsequent lixiviation or lithium recovery process. The anode material from the copper current collector was separated with bath ultrasonication in a water solution (15 g L-1) for 30 min. It was washed with water and ethanol multiple times using centrifugation and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. 2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) The modified Hummer’s process was applied to synthesize GO by following the previously reported method [21]. A detailed description of the experiment can be found in the supplementary file. 2.3 Synthesis of Co@NG electrocatalysts A one-step annealing process was used to synthesize Co@NG electrocatalysts. About 100 mg of GO, 200 mg of HMT, and 2 mL of precipitated cobalt leachate were mixed vigorously with 50 mL of ethanol solution in a 100 mL beaker. Later, the temperature was raised to 100 °C, allowing the solution to evaporate within 1 h. The dried powder was pyrolyzed for two hours in a tube furnace in an argon environment at various temperatures (700, 800, and 900 °C). The heating rate was kept at 5 °C min−1 while the furnace system controlled the cooling time. The final black powder synthesized at temperatures (700, 800, and 900 °C) was designated as Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900, respectively. For comparison, Co@rGO was prepared by skipping the nitrogen source, while NG was prepared without adding any cobalt source. 2.4 Electrochemical measurements All ORR electrochemical experiments were performed using the auto-lab PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation equipped with nova 2.1 software. The electrolyte (1 M KOH) was purged with nitrogen to collect background data, followed by purging oxygen for 20 min before analysis. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at various rotation rates was gathered by using a rotating disc electrode (RDE), and the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) diagram was subsequently evaluated. Evolved hydrogen peroxide percentage and the number of electrons transferred were evaluated using RRDE with a biased ring potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE. During the analysis, the O2 was purged over the electrolyte to maintain an oxygen atmosphere throughout the measurement. Membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) for DMFC was fabricated using the as-synthesized Co@NG catalyst as a cathode (3.0 mg cm−2) and Pt-Ru/C catalyst (2 mg cm−2, metal basis) as the anode. The powder catalysts were ultrasonically mixed with 5% Nafion ionomer (10 µL for 5 mg powder sample) in isopropanol/water 1 mL (1:1 v/v) before being brush-coated over a commercial gas diffusion layer (GDL) with an area of 4 cm2. Pretreated commercial Fumasep FAA-3-PK-130 membrane was used as a separator. The MEAs were produced by sandwiching a membrane between catalyst-coated carbon cloths by hot-pressing at 80 °C for 3 min. The DMFC polarization analysis was performed with Arbin (SN 215639, 100 A, 60 V) instrument. A mixed solution of 1.0 M methanol and 1.0 M KOH was pumped to the anode at 1.0 mL per minute, humidified oxygen was supplied to the cathode at 100 sccm, and the temperature was maintained at 70 °C. 2.5 Computational analysis We performed spin-polarized density functional theory calculations (DFT) using the Vienna Ab Initio Package (VASP version 5.4.4.) [35]. Details of the analysis were presented in the supporting information. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Composition and structure properties Fig. 1 (a) shows the green recycling route of spent LiCoO2 to advanced catalysis production for ORR. This method is considered environmentally benign as citric acid is a biodegradable and non-toxic material, making it a safer alternative to traditional recovery methods that may use harmful chemicals. Novel aspects of this study include the following: (1) the recycling of both cathodic and anodic materials, (2) the use of organic acid as a leachant combined with reusing unutilized acid and oxidant reduces energy requirements for extra water evaporation to recover lithium and (3) synthesizing highly active ORR catalyst while recovering high purity Li2CO3. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to investigate the leaching efficiency. After organic acid leaching and subsequent precipitation, the leaching efficiency of Li and Co is as high as 95.10% and 97.25%, respectively. The XRD was taken to explore the crystallinity and successful formation of the prepared Co@NG catalysts. The XRD spectrum of prepared Co@NG catalysts at various annealing temperatures is shown in Fig. 1(b). All Co@NG samples show three distinctive peaks at 2ϴ values 44.2°, 51.5° and 75.5°, which can be attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cobalt phase (JCPDS 05–0727) [36]. An XRD was also taken for spent graphite and synthesized GO (Fig. S6). The diffraction peaks for spent graphite at 2ϴ 26.6° indicates a hexagonal crystal structure in carbon coordination. This peak disappeared, and a new peak at 2ϴ = 10.4° was observed for GO indicating successful oxidation of graphite. The structure and carbonization extent of the Co@NG catalysts were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1c). The D-band (related to disorder) and G-bands (planar configuration of Sp2-carbon induced by graphitization) were observed at ∼ 1350 and 1591 cm−1, respectively [37]. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (I D/I G) is used to assess the degree of graphitization and defects in carbon materials. A lower ratio indicates a higher graphitization degree and fewer defects in composite samples. The I D/I G value of Co-NG-700, Co-NG-800, and Co-NG-900 is 1.17, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively, indicating that defects and vacancies are plentiful.A slight increase in graphitization as temperature increases is evidenced by a slight decrease in the I D/I G ratio (Table S1). A TGA analysis of all Co@NG catalysts was conducted to evaluate the metal loading at a temperature range from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 1d). Degradation trends for all three electrocatalysts are identical, with the first weight loss of ∼100 °C could be caused by the elimination of physisorbed water in Co@NG materials. After ∼300 degrees, rapid weight loss was observed due to carbon materials burning until temperatures close to 500 °C. The Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900 each contain 22.38%, 27.71%, and 30.22%, respectively, as cobalt in the final residue. Fig. 2 (a) shows XPS analysis of the Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900. The individual elements: C, N, and Co were also identified in all Co@NG composites by XPS analysis. The existence of the element O may be attributed to eitheraninevitable adsorbed oxygen species or the little oxidation of the sample surfaces. The respective atomic ratios of different catalysts are displayed in Table S2. The deconvoluted XPS spectra of Co 2p for all catalysts are shown in Fig. 2(b). The deconvoluted Co 2p XPS spectra of the synthesized catalysts suggest the coexistence of metallic Co0 (778.5 eV), Co2+ (795.5 and 780.2 eV), and Co-N (782.2 eV) [38]. The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of C 1s is shown in Fig. 2(c). The XPS peaks at 285.3, 287.7, and 289.7 eV corresponding to C–N, C–C, and O–C=O bonds, respectively, suggesting the introduced heteroatom interacts with the carbon matrix and nitrogen doping was successful [39]. The spectrum of N 1s deconvolved into four components: pyridinic-N (398.2–398.5 eV), CoN x (399.2 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.9 eV), and graphitic-N (401.1 eV) (Fig. 2d) [40,41]. An XPS analysis demonstrated the success of nitrogen doping, with the respective nitrogen contents as 4.3%, 8.1%, and 1.32% for Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900, respectively (Fig. S7). The Co@NG-800 possesses the highest percentage of nitrogen, mainly dominated by pyridinic-N and Co-N-C, known active sites that facilitate oxygen adsorption and overall catalytic activity [42]. The content of each nitrogen type in individual composite material is shown in Fig. S8. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that graphitic-N and pyridinic-N are synergistically responsible for ORR activity. The graphitic-N enhances conductivity, increasing limited current density, and pyridinic-N determines ORR onset potential. The graphitic nitrogen content of each componentincreases with the annealing temperature, which is consistent with previous studies [43]. The N2 adsorption–desorption test was investigated to assess the specific surface area and porous characteristics. All three curves exhibit type-IV isotherms with hysteresis loops indicating amesoporous structure (Fig. 2e). The BET surface areas of Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900 are 205, 260.2, and 191.3 m2 g−1, respectively as summarized in Table S1. The average pore size of Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900 are 2.96, 2.75, and 3.1 nm, respectively. The pore size distribution curves of all Co@NG composites possess micropore sizes with a majority of below 15 nm (Fig. 2f). The high surface area and porosity of Co@NG-800 may contribute to its higher catalytic activity by improving mass transfer kinetics across the electrode during the ORR. [44]. SEM images reveal that cobalt nanoparticles are successfully coated on the graphene surface with nearly uniform distribution (Fig. 3 a-c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of Co@NG-800 reveal that nanosized particles are uniformly distributed throughout the graphene surface. The synthesized catalysts have a porous nature, as observed from SEM images. As seen from TEM images (Fig. 3d-f), the metallic cobalt and graphene are evident with uniform distribution of average particle sizes of 10–12 nm. An HRTEM analysis (Fig. 3g) shows lattice fringe for metallic Co (0.208 nm) and carbon (0.35 nm) [45]. Elemental map scanning images reveal that Co, N, and C exist and are distributed homogeneously (Fig. 3h). Fig. 3(i) further indicates the polycrystalline nature of the Co nanoparticles based on the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED). 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance towards ORR A CV test was conducted under O2, or N2 saturated 1 M KOH solution to analyze the ORR performance of Co@NG materials. Fig. 4 (a) shows that all Co@NG catalysts exhibited no cathodic reduction peaks in the N2-saturated KOH solution. The CV analysis in an electrolyte saturated with O2 displayed obvious cathodic peaks at 0.82 V, 0.85 V, and 0.81 V (vs. RHE) for Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800 and Co@NG-900, respectively, that all Co@NG composites have excellent ORR catalytic performance. That may be because catalytically active Co-N-C active sites are produced effectively regardless of the source material, SILBs.The DFT-related theoretical and experimental studies also evidenced that pyridinic nitrogen and transition metal-coordinated N species are crucial active sites to enhance the ORR. An onset potential for Co@NG-700, Co@NG-800, and Co@NG-900 is 0.88, 0.92 and 0.87 V vs. RHE, respectively. The Co@NG-800 has the highest positive onset potential for ORR, indicating a lesser barrier for ion and electron transfer may be due to higher porosity with more active sites [46]. For the evaluation of the ORR performance in an accurate manner, LSV curves for each composite were evaluated at different electrode rotation speeds ranging from 400 to 2400 revolutions per minute (RPM). The LSV at 1600 RPM was taken to compare kinetics evaluation parameters (Fig. 4b). The Co@NG-800 has an exceptional half-wave potential of 0.880 V vs. RHE that is comparable to commercial Pt/C (30 wt%) catalysts (0.888 V). Fig. 4(c) shows an LSV curve of Co@NG-800 at different electrode rotations. The LSV profiles taken in O2-saturated 1 M KOH demonstrate that a rise in rotational speed from 400 to 2400 rpm increases the current density. Three distinct zones can be observed: a kinetically controlled region (>0.92 V vs. RHE), a mixed kinetic and diffusion-controlled region (∼0.7 < V < ∼0.92), and a diffusion-controlled region (<∼0.7 V vs. RHE). The sluggish rate of O2 reduction and a minor increase in current density with decreasing potential are all characteristics of the kinetically controlled zone [47]. A significant increase in current density with decreasing potential is observed at a mixed kinetic and diffusion control region. The current became somewhat stable at the mass diffusion-controlled region as the limiting factor is the diffusion of reactants towards the active site and the delivery of reaction products out of the active site [48]. The LSV curves at various rotation speeds for Co@NG-700 and Co@NG-900 displayed similar behavior, as shown in Fig. S16. The LSV curves at various rotation speeds were used to plot K-L lines for all Co@NG electrocatalysts (Fig. S17). The parallel alignment and linearity of the fitted K-L lines indicate that ORR proceeds via a similar number of electron transfer processes and the first-order reaction kinetics, respectively. The K-L curves of synthesized catalysts were plotted together with benchmark Pt/C at 0.6 V vs. RHE (Fig. S17d). All catalysts reveal approximate parallelism, indicating similar electron transfer during the reaction. Tafel analysis is a fantastic technique that provides insights into the activity and kinetics of electrooxidation and is used to forecast the rate-determining step. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the Tafel slope of the Co@NG-800 catalyst is 73 mV dec–1, and for Co@NG-700 and Co@NG-900 are 93 and 95 mV dec−1, respectively. The Tafel slope of the Co@NG-800 is lower than all catalysts, including Pt/C (76 mV dec-1), demonstrating excellent kinetics towards ORR. Fig. 4(e) shows the RRDE analysis plots for both ring and disc currents for all synthesized composites in 1 M KOH at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm. Fig. 4(f) displayed a comparison of H2O2 yield and computed number of electrons (n) for all synthesized catalysts, which is evaluated from RRDE analysis using equations S5 and S6. All Co@NG catalysts have low H2O2 yield (<12%) over the potential range of 0.4 to 0.7 V, with Co@NG-800 having the lowest. Keeping peroxide production to a minimum during the ORR is crucial because it may negatively impact fuel cell components such as catalysts, catalyst support, and membranes. Similarly, the Co@NG-800 catalyst has the highest calculated electron transfer number of ∼3.95, indicating ORR takes place at the 4e- transfer mechanism. Reports have shown that transition metal with N-doped graphene materials reduces oxygen in alkaline media with 4 e- transfer pathways [49]. The kinetic current density (Jk) at 0.85 V was evaluated for all synthesized catalysts together with commercial Pt/C (Fig. 5 a). The Jk of Co@NG-800 reached 7.7 mA cm−2, the highest among all catalysts and comparable to Jk value of Pt/C (8.3 mA cm−2). In addition to having great performance, catalysts also need to be durable over an extended time. A chronoamperometric response was used to determine the stability of Co@NG-800 and Pt/C (Fig. 5b). The initial current density of Co@NG-800 remains 84.5% after a stability test of ∼14 h, far better than that of Pt/C (47%). The Co@NG catalyst exhibits superior ORR stability, which is critical for practical applications. Nitrogen doping enhances the electronic and surface properties of the composite catalyst, providing more active sites for the ORR that leads to higher catalytic activity and stability. The activity of Pt/C deteriorates faster may be principally due to the detachment of nanoparticles from the carbon supports, which may cause agglomeration and porosity loss [50]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful method for exploring electrode–electrolyte interfaces because it can simultaneously give us charge transfer kinetics and interface resistance in solution. The diameter of the first semi-circles responsible for charge-transfer resistance (R ct) in the analysis, whereas the solution resistance marks (R s) beginning of the spectrum. The Co@NG-800 demonstrated the lowest R ct (8.0 Ω) and R s (6.1 Ω) values compared to the others, indicating improved kinetics with lower charge transfer and solution resistance (Fig. 5c). The kinetic response of Co@NG-800 for O2 purging and the existence of methanol was tested by chronoamperometric technique (Fig. 5d). The first 1600 s of the chronoamperometry was carried out in nitrogen-saturated conditions, the following 1600 to ∼7500 s were done in oxygen-saturated conditions, and the final 2000 s were carried out with the addition of 3 M methanol in oxygen-saturated conditions. The catalyst shows a sudden cathodic current increasing for O2 purging, indicating good ORR activity, while the response did not deviate significantly in the presence of methanol. The Co@NG-800 and benchmark Pt/C were additionally studied for methanol crossover by adding 5 mL methanol during chronoamperometric analysis (Fig. S22). In comparing Co@NG and Pt/C methanol tolerance, the cathode current of Pt/C immediately declines after introducing 5 mL of methanol. The Co@NG has excellent methanol tolerance, corrosion resistance, and selectivity for ORR. Noble metal-free catalysts are known to be methanol-tolerant in ORR reactions, making them promising candidates for use in DMFC applications [34]. The CV plots of electrocatalysts at non-faradic regions from 0.93 to 1.13 V (vs. RHE) at different scan rates are shown in Fig. S18. The fitted current vs. scan rateslope is double-layer capacitance (C dl). The C dl for Co@NG-800 is about 102 mF cm−2, which is higher than the C dl values of Co@NG-700 (87 mF cm−2) and Co@NG-900 (74 mF cm−2), as shown in Fig. 5(e). This indicates that the Co@NG-800 catalyst has more active sites as compared to others [51]. The number of electrons transferred during ORR and other kinetic parameters are summarized in a Table. S3. The ORR kinetic activities of various composite catalysts are compared in Table S4. The regenerated Co@NG catalyst showed high ORR activity compared to previously reported non-noble ORR catalysts disregarding its raw material source, waste batteries. The following factors may be responsible for the increase in catalytic activity. (1) Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−N−C) with high nitrogen content may serve as an active site for ORR by reducing overpotential, as confirmed by DFT analysis;(2) N-doping graphene facilitates ORR catalysis by causing a net positive charge to be created on carbon atoms in the nitrogen-free graphene plane through intramolecular charge transfer (3) the synergistic effect between Co atoms and N-rGO [52]. Nitrogen complexes, especially pyridinic-N, reduced oxygen adsorption energy, enabling easier oxygen reduction [53]. Compared to Co@NG-800, Co@N-900 exhibits lower ORR performance, which can be attributed to the lower nitrogen content and less porosity than Co@NG-800. The synthesis expenditure for the Co@NG catalyst is only about USD 2.7 per gram, which is more than 40 times cheaper than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, as cost analyses evaluated in Table S7 and shown (Fig. 5f). The cost of the Co@NG catalyst would be further decreased if it were manufactured on a large scale. 3.3 DFT calculations To understand the effect of nitrogen contents on ORR activity, computational simulations were conducted using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations [54]. We modeled four different pyridinic-N embedded graphene with an isolated Co site, referred to as N1, N2, N3 and N4, based on the number of nitrogen (N) atoms surrounding the cobalt (Co) atoms (Fig. 6 a). We note that the adsorption of reaction intermediates (O*, OH*, OOH*) on pyridinic-N and carbon sites are unfavorable as O* and OH* spontaneously form bonds with the nearby Co site, and OOH* desorbs from the surface, indicating that Co site is the only favorable adsorption site [55]. The potential determining step (PDS) of CoN x is found to be the last protonation step, i.e., OH* + (H+ + e-) → * + H2O, as weaker binding of OH* could reduce η ORR. As the number of nitrogen increases, we observed that binding Gibbs free energy of adsorbates became gradually weaker (Fig. 6b). Particularly, ΔOH* changes from 0.22 eV to 0.97 eV when the number of N changes from 1 to 4. Consequently, N4 showed the highest onset potential of 0.967 V, which is approximate to the experimental onset potential of 0.92 V (Table S3). Fig. 6(c) shows the calculated η ORR for four models indicating that the overpotentials decrease with increasing nitrogen content as high for N1 and lowest for N4. This indicates there is less barrier for ORR with increasing nitrogen content as ORR catalytic activity is enhanced. 3.4 DMFC analysis To study the practical application of synthesized catalysts, a single-cell DMFC was constructed using a Fumasep FAA-3-PK-130, anion exchange membrane with either Co@NG or Pt/C as the cathode and Pt-Ru/C as the anode. The current–voltage (I-V) analysis was conducted to investigate the further performance of the synthesized catalyst in the DMFC. A mixed solution of 1.0 M methanol and 1.0 M KOH was pumped to the anode at 1.0 mL min−1. The humidified oxygen was supplied to the cathode at 100 sccm, and the temperature was maintained at 70 °C. The Co@NG-800//Pt-Ru/C displayed an open circuit voltage of 0.76 V and a peak power density of 34.7 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 120 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6d). The commercial Pt/C// Pt-Ru/C configuration delivers a maximum power density of only 17.5 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 54 mA cm−2. The stability of a single DMFC was measured by voltage–time behavior by applying a dischargecurrent density of 25 mA cm−2 at 70 °C which showed good stability for more than 30 h (Fig. 6e). The stability was little interrupted during the change of fuel or oxygen bottle, or other sporadic occurrences happened during the stability test. The high performance of the Co@NG electrocatalysts may also be due to a hierarchical porous nanoarchitecture that enhances catalytic activity due to the accessibility of active metal sites and the synergistic effect between Co atoms and N-doped graphene. 4 Conclusions Reutilization of SLIBs from portable electronics and EVs could have a huge positive economic impact.It is necessary to assess the economics of all inputs, such as energy, reagents, and wastewater treatment, before large-scale recycling can be applied. In this process, leaching-solvent (waste acid, remaining oxidizing agent, and solvents (water and ethanol) were reused after the complete precipitation of cobalt.Using environmentally benign citric acid leaching and selective precipitation provides a sustainable and safe method for recovering lithium and cobalt from spent lithium-ion batteries, helping to reduce waste and support the circular economy. This study avoided element separation and suggested a simple method to convert the used LiCoO2-based batteries into valuable electrocatalysts by separating lithium with less complicated process steps. The upcycled Co@NG showed promising activities towards ORR, with Co@NG-800 (synthesized at 800 °C) exhibiting the highest in terms of the half-wave potential (E 1/2 = 0.880 V vs. RHE), comparable to commercial Pt/C (E 1/2 = 0.888 V) with ∼ 4 electron transfer process. The Co@NG with high nitrogen content displayed the highest onset potential of 0.92 V, approximating the theoretically analyzed value of 0.967 V by DFT analysis. The alkaline DMFC analysis was investigated to determine the viability of the synthesized catalyst for practical applications. The Co@NG-800 cathode with Pt-Ru/C anode displayed an open circuit voltage of 0.76 V and a peak power density of 34.7 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 120 mA cm−2 with good stability for more than 30 h test at 25 mA cm−2. This recycling route illustrates how SLIBs can be used in energy conversion devices, opening up a cheap and efficient path to creating a clean energy conversion system. Our waste-to-wealth approach is a closed-loop method that significantly reduces chemical use while eradicating secondary contamination.

        "dc:description": "Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (SLIBs) has become essential to preserve the environment and reclaim vital resources for sustainable development. The typical SLIBs recycling concentrated on separating valuable components had limitations, including high energy consumption and complicated separation processes. This work suggests a safe hydrometallurgical process to recover usable metallic cobalt from depleted LiCoO2 batteries by utilizing citric acid as leachant and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, with ethanol as a selective precipitating agent. The anode graphite was also recovered and converted to graphene oxide (GO). The above components were directly resynthesized to cobalt-integrated nitrogen-doped graphene (Co@NG).The Co@NG showed a decent activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential of 0.880 V vs. RHE, almost similar to Pt/C (0.888 V vs. RHE) and with an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE. The metal-nitrogen-carbon (Co-N-C) having the highest nitrogen content has decreased the barrier for ORR since the reaction was enhanced for Co@NG-800, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The Co@NG cathode catalyst coupled with commercial Pt-Ru/C as anode catalyst exhibits excellent performance for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with a peak power density of 34.7 mW cm−2 at a discharge current density of 120 mA cm−2 and decent stability, indicating the promising utilization of spent battery materials in DMFC applications. Besides, lithium was recovered from supernatant as lithium carbonate by coprecipitation process. This work avoids sophisticated elemental separation by utilizing SLIBs for other renewable energy applications, lowering the environmental concerns associated with recycling.",
