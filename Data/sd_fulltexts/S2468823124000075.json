Oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups on the surface of non-metallic carbon-based catalysts have been regarded as active sites for NH3 selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at low temperature. In this study, series of AC-xO-yN catalysts were prepared via grafting oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-containing groups on active carbon (AC). The activity test results showed that the denitration efficiency of AC-5O-0 N and AC-0O-4 N catalyst were only 20 and 44 % at a temperature of 120 °C and a GHSV of 4500 h−1, respectively, while the activity of the AC-5O-4 N catalysts reached 97 % at the same condition, indicating that the oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups exhibited a superior synergistic effect in facilitating the low-temperature NH3-SCR denitration reaction. Characterization results revealed that the oxygen-containing groups (mainly carboxyl and lactone groups) contribute to NH3 adsorption and activation, while the nitrogen-containing groups (especially pyridine nitrogen groups) could promote NO adsorption and oxidation. The co-existence of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups can synergistically advance the low-temperature NH3-SCR denitration reaction on the surface of the AC catalyst via a fast SCR route. This work might provide insight into designing and preparing non-metallic carbon-based catalysts with high denitration performance.

Ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) technology based on vanadium-based catalysts has achieved dazzling results in purifying the flue gas from coal-fired power plants [4–6]. Due to the high active temperature window (320–400 °C) of vanadium-based catalysts, enormous energy should be input for industrial boiler flue gas denitrification, resulting in high operating costs [7,8]. The metal oxide catalysts such as MnO x and CoO x have satisfied low-temperature denitration catalyst, but their application is limited by poor stability in the presence of H2O and SO2 [9–12]. Non-metallic carbon-based catalysts have the features of a high specific surface area, multistage pore structure and the rich surface groups, which can achieve low temperatures (<250 °C) NH3-SCR denitration and simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants (such as NO x , SO2, Hg, dioxin) [13–15]. To improve the denitration performance of non-metallic carbon-based catalysts, researchers have studied the NH3-SCR denitration reaction process based on non-metallic carbon-based catalysts and modified the catalysts based on this to better meet the needs of the application [16]. For example, Li et al. [17] tried to construct the relationship between acidic groups and NH3-SCR denitration activity. They found that the increase of phenolic, anhydride and ester groups can enhance the catalytic activity of carbon-based catalysts. Guo et al. [18] proposed that nitric acid oxidation treatment can induced the formation of carboxyl groups, anhydrides and phenolic groups over coal-based carbon-based catalysts, which can promote the NH3 activation adsorption capacity on the coal-based carbon-based catalysts, thereby enhance its denitration activity. In addition to oxygen-containing groups, nitrogen-containing groups on AC also have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the denitration process [16]. Xia et al. [19] and Lin et al. [20] prepared carbon-based catalysts with enriched nitrogen-containing groups by thermal treatment at 1000 °C under the N2 atmosphere and impregnating nitrogen-enriched additives, respectively. It is found that nitrogen-containing groups can improve denitration performance by promoting the oxidation of NO. Qu et al. [21], constructed nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon-based catalysts by controlling the pore structure and nitrogen doping environment and confirmed that nitrogen-containing groups have a facilitating effect on the NO oxidation process via experimental and density functional theory calculations. The above work has proved the role of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups during NH3-SCR denitration reaction on carbon-based catalysts, respectively. However, oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functional groups are present on the carbon-based catalyst surface at the same time. Therefore, the denitration activity of the catalysts should result from the combination of multiple functional groups [22–24]. In this work, AC-xO-yN catalysts with different contents of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups were prepared via grafting oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-containing groups on active carbon (AC). The NH3-SCR performance denitration of the AC-xO-yN catalysts were investigated. To fully elucidate the role of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups in the NH3-SCR process, the surface physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed by a series of characterizations. Finally, the reaction mechanism of low-temperature denitration of the catalyst was revealed by in-situ DRIFTS. This work contributes to reveal the synergistic effect between oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups on AC catalysts, which shed light on the research on the low-temperature NH3-SCR technology. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation Activated carbon (AC, 8–16 mesh, Aladdin), oxalic acid (C2H2O6, 99.5 %, Aladdin) and melamine (C3H6N6, 99 %, Aladdin) were used without further treatment. The AC catalysts were modified by the impregnation method. Commercial AC (8–16 mesh) was first crushed to 20–40 mesh. The AC was mixed with oxalic acid and 100 ml of deionized water at a mass ratio of (1: 0.05), and stirred with 80 °C heating until complete drying, then the obtained sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain AC-5O, then the AC-5O sample and melamine powder were mixed in solid phase at a mass ratio of (1: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4), then calcined at 600 °C for 2 h to obtain the AC-5O-nN (n is the mass ratio of activated carbon and melamine) sample. Finally, the AC-0O-4 N catalyst without oxalic acid addition was prepared. 2.2 Catalytic tests and characterization The activity measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (the inner diameter was 7 mm) using a 1- or 2-ml catalyst of 20–40 meshes. The feed gas mixture contained 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, 10 % O2 and N2 as the balance gas. The total flow rate of the feed gas was 150 mL min−1, corresponding to a GHSV of 4500 h−1 or 9000 h−1. The activity data were collected when the catalytic reaction reached steady-state condition at each temperature. The compositions of the inlet and outlet gases were monitored continually using an online FT-IR gas analyzer (SERVOPRO 4900). The values of NO x (x = 1 and 2) conversion and N2 selectivity would be calculated as follows: N O x conversion ( % ) = [ NO x ] in − [ NO x ] out [ NO x ] in × 100 % N 2 selection ( % ) = [ 1 − 2 N 2 O [ NO x ] in + [ NH 3 ] in ] × 100 % Where NO x,in and NO x,out represents the NO x concentration in the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively. The details of the characterization are presented in the supplementary material. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and surface properties The crystalline structure of AC catalysis was analyzed by XRD, the results are shown in Fig. 1 (a). Two distinct peaks at 2θ = 26 and 43° are present for all AC-xO-yN samples, which are attributed to the diffraction peaks of amorphous carbon [25]. There is a weak SiO2 diffraction peak observed at around 27°, indicating the presence of impurities in the AC samples [26]. In addition, there are no obvious g-C3N4 characteristic peaks in Fig. 1(a), indicating that the catalyst surface does not have obviously g-C3N4 species. Specific surface area and pore structure distribution of AC samples were tested by BET (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). The AC samples all showed obvious adsorption phenomena in the low specific pressure region, indicating the existence of obvious microporous characteristics, while the adsorption phenomena in the middle and high specific pressure regions were weaker, showing that the samples were mainly microporous [27]. The curves showed I-type adsorption-resolution curves, indicating that the samples existed in the lamellar porous structure [28–30]. In addition, the specific surface area of the AC samples decreased with the increase of nitrogen group loading (Table 1 ). From the pore structure distribution (Fig. 1(c)), it could be observed that the decrease in the specific surface area was mainly attributed to the decrease in the amount of micropores (< 1 nm). It might be attributed to the fact that the nitrogen groups bound to the microporous surface blocked the pore channels, resulting in a decrease in microporous content and specific surface. Fig. 2 (a) and Fig. S1 shows the XPS binding energy spectra of O 1 s for all AC samples. After fitted, the O 1 s peaks can be evenly divided into five peaks as ketone, carbonyl (531–531.8 eV), phenol hydroxyl (532.4–532.7 eV), lactone group (533.2–533.5 eV), carboxyl group (534.5–535.3 eV), and the adsorption of oxygen and water (535.6–537 eV) [17 , 31 , 32]. In Fig. S1, the content of carboxyl and lactone groups of the AC catalysts was significantly lower than the AC-5O-0 N catalysts, indicating that the loading of oxalic acid increased the content of carboxyl and lactone groups of the AC catalysts. In addition, the content of carboxyl and lactone groups of AC-5O-1 N is lower than AC-5O-0 N in Fig. 2(a), while the phenolic hydroxyl group content is higher relative to AC-5O-0 N. In Fig. 2(c), it is found that the proportion of carboxyl and lactone groups on the catalyst decreases with the increase of nitrogen groups content, while the proportion of phenolic hydroxyl groups has a significant increase. Thus, it can be inferred that the nitrogen groups tend to bind to the carboxyl and lactone groups. This may be because that the amino group of melamine, which is the nitrogen source, tends to bind to the acidic groups (carboxyl and lactone groups). Fig. 2(b) shows the XPS spectra of N 1 s. The sample N 1 s peaks can be classified into four peaks after fitted, including peak 1, pyridine-type nitrogen (N-6, 398.7 ± 0.3 eV); peak 2, pyrrole, pyridinone-type nitrogen (N-5, 400.3 ± 0.2 eV); peak 3, quaternary ammonium-type nitrogen (N-Q, 401.4 ± 0.3 eV) and peak 4, chemically adsorbed nitrogen oxides (NO, 405.0 ± 0.5 eV) [20,33,34]. It has been found the nitrogen groups on the AC surface increased significantly with increased melamine loading. It indicates that melamine can promote the nitrogen groups of AC samples. In Fig. 2(d), the content of N-6 increased with the increase of melamine loading and its proportion was the largest. Among them, the pyridine group is regarded to be the main group affecting the denitration efficiency of AC [20,35,36]. Table 2 shows the XPS results of the elemental content for the AC catalysts. The oxygen content of the AC-5O-0 N catalyst increased from 9.25 to 13.88 % relative to the AC catalyst, demonstrating that the loading of oxalic acid was able to increase the content of oxygen groups of the AC catalysts. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the nitrogen content on the surface of the AC catalyst increases with increasing the loading of nitrogenous compounds, which indicates that the nitrogen content of the AC catalysts can be increased by loading nitrogenous compounds followed by calcination. Moreover, the higher the amount of loading before calcination, the higher the content of nitrogen groups on the surface. It indicates that the formation of nitrogen groups on the AC catalyst is more favourable the higher the amount of melamine loaded. 3.2 NH3-SCR performance of catalysts Fig. 3 (a) shows the NO conversion rates of all samples at temperatures ranging from 120 to 240 °C. The AC-5O-0 N and AC-0O-4 N were found to have poor denitration activity at low-temperature, with only 14 and 39 % at 120 °C and GHSV = 9000 h−1, respectively. It demonstrates that although the single doping of oxygen and nitrogen groups has low-temperature denitration performance, its lower activity makes it challenging to achieve the denitration requirements in industry. In contrast, AC-5O-4 N showed significantly enhanced denitration activity, reaching 78 % at 120 °C and GHSV=9000 h−1. It indicates that both oxygen and nitrogen groups possess denitration capabilities individually and exhibit a synergistic promotion effect, leading to a substantial improvement in low-temperature denitration performance. The denitration performance of AC-5O-1 N, AC-5O-2 N and AC-5O-4 N samples increased with increased melamine loading. Combined with the XPS N 1 s results, it is suggested that the loading of nitrogen groups for the AC-5O-0 N samples can increase the activity of the catalysts, and the activity increases with the increase in the content of nitrogen groups on the surface (especially N-6). In addition, combined with the BET results, it shows that the loss of specific surface area due to the loading of nitrogen groups does not inhibit the denitration performance, suggesting that the catalytic activity comes mainly from the surface-loaded active nitrogen groups. It further demonstrates that the improvement in denitration performance originated from the activity of the nitrogen groups rather than from the surface physical properties. In addition, AC-5O-4 N had the best denitration activity, showing a conversion of 78 % at 120 °C and GHSV = 9000 h−1. The XPS experiments were carried out on the AC and AC-5O-0 N to analyze the reason for the increased activity. The results (Fig. S1) showed that the loading of oxalic acid increased the percentage of carboxylate and lactone groups on the surface, which are the key groups to promote the adsorption of activated NH3 by AC [32]. Therefore, it is shown that the oxalic acid loading can improve the low-temperature denitration performance of the AC catalyst. It is demonstrated that increasing the content of both oxygen groups (carboxyl and lactone groups) and nitrogen groups can contribute to the improvement of denitration activity, and that both have synergistic promoting effects at the same time. In addition to focusing on the denitration performance, the selectivity of the reaction is also an important factor in evaluating the catalytic performance, Fig. 3(b) shows the selectivity of the AC samples for N2, and it can be seen that the selectivity of all AC samples is > 98 % at 120–150 °C. This indicated that all the catalysts have excellent N2 selectivity and high utilization for NH3. In addition, the space velocity also has a considerable influence on the denitration performance, especially for the AC catalysts, and it shows that (Fig. 3(c)) AC-5O-4 N can achieve 97 % activity at 120 °C when the space velocity reduces the GHSV = 4500 h−1. In the industry, the GHSV of AC denitration is generally in the range of 400–500 h−1, representing the synergistic promotion of the denitration reaction by the oxygen and nitrogen elements, which can greatly improve its flue gas treatment capacity. Fig. 3(d) shows the denitration performance of the AC-5O-4 N sample at 120 °C and GHSV = 4500 h−1 for 12 h. It can be observed that the denitration performance of the AC-5O-4 N catalyst is always maintained at about 97 %, indicating that the AC-5O-4 N catalyst has good stability. In addition, XRD characterization of the AC-5O-4 N catalyst before and after the reaction (Fig. S3) showed that the denitrification reaction does not affect its surface structure. 3.3 Surface adsorption capacity of NH3 and NO The NH3 adsorption-activation ability of AC samples was analyzed by NH3-TPD&MS characterization. Fig. 4 (a) shows the NH3 adsorption capacity of the AC samples, in which it can be seen that the NH3 adsorption capacity of AC-5O-0 N is weak, and it has an obvious desorption peak corresponding to the weak acidic sites on the AC surface at 120 °C [17,37,38]. While the desorption curve of AC-5O-1 N was close to that of AC-5O-0 N, indicating that a small amount of loaded nitrogen element had almost no effect on the NH3 adsorption capacity on the AC surface, and the NH3 adsorption capacity was enhanced with the increase of the nitrogen elemental loadings, which might be attributed to the N-6 group facilitates the adsorption conduction of NH3 to the catalyst surface [36]. In addition, the NH3 adsorption capacity of the AC-0O-4 N catalyst was weaker than that of the AC-5O-4 N catalyst, which proved that the NH3 adsorption activation capacity of AC-loaded with nitrogen groups alone was limited. Therefore, the acidic oxygen groups improved the NH3 adsorption capacity of the AC catalyst. These results indicate that the increase of NH3 adsorption activation capacity of acidic oxygen groups (Carboxy and lactone) is a key factor for the high denitrification performance of AC-5O-4 N catalysts. The NO-TPD&MS spectra showed that the NO adsorption capacity of AC-5O-1 N, AC-5O-2 N, and AC-5O-4 N samples increased gradually with the increase of the content of nitrogen groups of the AC, and there is only one obvious detachment peak (at 147 °C) [39,40], whereas there was almost no NO adsorption site of AC-5O-0 N, which indicates it has no adsorption capacity for almost NO. And it can indicate that the adsorption capacity of NO is almost entirely from the loading of nitrogen elements on the surface, especially pyridinyl nitrogen. It suggests that the nitrogen groups improve the low-temperature denitration activity by promoting the NO adsorption and oxidation performance of the catalyst. In addition, the NO adsorption capacity of AC-5O-4 N was significantly weaker than that of AC-0O-4 N, which was attributed to the inhibition of NO adsorption by the acidic oxygen group [17]. By comparing the catalytic activities, the improved denitration performance of AC-5O-4 N can be attributed to the synergistic promotion of adsorptive oxidation of NO and adsorptive activation of NH3, which dramatically improves the low-temperature NH3-SCR activity through the NO + NO2 + 2NH3 → 2N2 + 3H2O (fast SCR) reaction [36,41]. 3.4 Catalyst reaction process and mechanism analysis The adsorption of NH3 and NO + O2 on the surface of AC-5O-4 N catalysts was investigated by in-situ DRIFTS. The AC-5O-4 N catalyst was pretreated at 240 °C to remove the physically adsorbed water and other substances on the surface of the catalyst. Then the catalyst was cooled down to 120 °C to adsorb NH3 for 60 min, then a mixture of NO + O2 was passed in the catalyst for 60 min. Fig. 5 (a) shows the NH3 adsorption of the AC-5O-4 N catalyst. In Fig. 5(a), after the NH3 was passed, obvious absorption peaks appeared on the surface of the catalyst, among which the absorption peaks at 1623 cm−1 and 900–1100 cm−1 were considered to be the vibrational peaks of NH3 adsorbed on the Lewis acid site [42–44], and the band at 1737 cm−1 was considered to be the vibrational peaks of the NH3 formed on the BrØnsted acid site for the NH4 + species [25,45,46]. The bands at 1696 and 1558 cm−1 are considered as the oxides formed by NH3 and surface oxygen species [17].1523 cm−1 is considered as the vibrational peak of adsorbed amide species, which is the partial oxidation of adsorbed NH3 by acidic oxygen [45]. In Fig. 5(b), the NH3 adsorption peaks on the catalyst surface showed a significant decrease after 1 min of NO + O2, and only the vibrational peaks of the adsorbed NH3 species at the Lewis acid site were more obvious. The intensity of the vibrational peaks of NH3 species started to decrease with the passage of NO + O2, while the characteristic peaks of NO species did not appear at the first time. It indicates that NO reacts preferentially with NH3 adsorbed on the surface and the reaction rate is fast. After 30 min, with the disappearance of the NH3 peaks on the surface of the catalyst, the peaks of NO2, and nitrate (NO3 −) appeared of the catalyst at 1627, 1600, and 1372 cm−1 [25,47,48], and the intensity of the peaks was enhanced with the increase of time, which indicates that NO exists as NO2 and nitrate on the catalyst surface [49]. It is demonstrated that NO reacts preferentially with surface-adsorbed NH3, as evidenced by pre-adsorption of NH3 followed by the passage of NO + O2. To further clarify the reaction mechanism, the reaction process with NH3 after 60 min of pre-adsorption of NO + O2 of AC-5O-4 N catalyst was also tested by in situ DRIFTS. In Fig. 5(c), the peaks of NO2 at 1628 and 1599 cm−1 and the peak of nitrate at 1370 cm−1 appeared on the surface of the AC-5O-4 N sample when NO and O2 were passed. The intensity of the nitrate peaks on the catalyst surface reached the highest after 60 min. In Fig. 5(d), after the introduction of NH3, the absorption peak of NO2 had a significant decrease, indicating that the surface adsorbed NO2 material can react quickly with NH3 species. It proves that the SCR reaction at the catalyst follows the fast SCR reaction path. Only the nitrate species remained on the surface of the catalyst (1370 cm−1), and the oxides formed by NH3 and surface oxygen species appeared on the surface of the catalyst for the first time with the passage of NH3 (1692, 1560 cm−1), and ligand NH3 species peaks (1626, 1000–1200 cm−1). It indicates that the reaction of NH3 with nitrate species formed on the catalyst surface is difficult at low-temperatures. It can be inferred that the adsorbed NH3 species on the surface mainly react with the weakly adsorbed NO2 species for fast SCR reaction denitration. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, in this study, the AC catalysts with abundant oxygen and nitrogen active sites on the surface were prepared by precise design, and the prepared AC-5O-4 N catalysts achieved 97 % denitration performance at 4500 h−1, 120 °C, with good selectivity (98 %) and denitration stability. It is demonstrated that oxygen and nitrogen double groups have a synergistic promoting effect on the low-temperature NH3-SCR denitration of the AC catalyst, as shown by comparing the single-element-loaded AC catalysts. The characterization results showed that the loading of oxalic acid brought abundant carboxyl and lactone groups to the catalyst surface, which improved the NH3 adsorption activation capacity of the AC. The loading of melamine increased the number of nitrogen-containing groups on the catalyst surface, and the abundant nitrogen-containing groups on the surface, especially quaternary nitrogen-containing groups, promoted the adsorption and oxidation capacity of NO on the catalyst surface. Synergistically, the reaction follows a fast SCR reaction pathway, which improves the SCR activity of the AC catalyst at low-temperatures. These finding of this study provide a new insight into the design and combination of heteroatom-doped AC catalysts and provide theoretical guidance for the development of high performance non-metallic carbon-based catalysts.

        "dc:description": "Oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups on the surface of non-metallic carbon-based catalysts have been regarded as active sites for NH3 selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at low temperature. In this study, series of AC-xO-yN catalysts were prepared via grafting oxygen-containing and/or nitrogen-containing groups on active carbon (AC). The activity test results showed that the denitration efficiency of AC-5O-0 N and AC-0O-4 N catalyst were only 20 and 44 % at a temperature of 120 °C and a GHSV of 4500 h−1, respectively, while the activity of the AC-5O-4 N catalysts reached 97 % at the same condition, indicating that the oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups exhibited a superior synergistic effect in facilitating the low-temperature NH3-SCR denitration reaction. Characterization results revealed that the oxygen-containing groups (mainly carboxyl and lactone groups) contribute to NH3 adsorption and activation, while the nitrogen-containing groups (especially pyridine nitrogen groups) could promote NO adsorption and oxidation. The co-existence of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups can synergistically advance the low-temperature NH3-SCR denitration reaction on the surface of the AC catalyst via a fast SCR route. This work might provide insight into designing and preparing non-metallic carbon-based catalysts with high denitration performance.",
