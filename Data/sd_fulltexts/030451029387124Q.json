UN1PV.IT Anna Gamba Invernizzi and Giovanni Vidari Dipartimento di Chimica Organica, Universita di Pavia, Via Taramelli 10, 27100, Pavia (Italy) (Received June 16, 1993 ) Abstract Rare earth cations catalyze the reduction of aldehydes and ketones by isopropanol. The reaction rate constants have been determined by 'H NMR spectroscopy in the presence of Lag+, Y3+ Lua+ Scs+, using Cl-, C104 and Tf0- as counterions; the values obtained indicate that the reaction rates increase as the cation size decreases and with the use of poorly co-ordinating counterions. Scandium trifluoromethanesulphonate turned out to be by far the best catalyst for these reactions. By comparison of strictly analogous aldehydes and ketones it has been found that the former compounds are more easily reduced than the latter. The formation of mixed ethers with isopropanol was observed during the reduction of aromatic carbonyl compounds substituted with electron donating groups. Key words: carbonyls; rare earths; reductions; scandium; trifluoromethanesulphonates Introduction Interest in organic reactions assisted by lanthanoids is increasing very rapidly; however, the use of Ln3+ cations as Lewis acids in homogeneous medium is still relatively scarce and the published papers deal mainly with the organic aspects of the problem [ 1 ] . It is worth noting that one of the most interesting features of the lanthanoid family is the regular variation of their properties along the series, which can allow their catalytic behaviour to be \"tuned\" through a proper choice of the cation. Actually, the fact that the lanthanoid (III) activity in organic reactions varies from one to another within the series has often been reported in the literature [ 1-3 ] , but little systematic study has been done on this subject. Recently we described some novel reactions of pyrone derivatives assisted by Ln3+, devoting special attention to the role of the cation size and the coun- *Corresponding author. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Our results indicated that the reaction rates increase with decreasing cation radius and increasing ionic character of the counterion. One of the reactions described by us was the reduction of 3-formylchromone (bpa) to 3-hydroxymethylchromone (imc) with isopropanol in the presence of Ln3+ (Ln = La, Tb, Lu). Although the use of lanthanoid (III) alkoxides as catalysts in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reaction is well documented [3], the reduction obtained by means of purely inorganic salts in isopropanol is quite new and suggests that Ln3+ in alcoholic medium gives rise to the formation of an incipient alkoxide. Moreover, this result agrees with the observation that lanthanoid (III) co-ordinated alcohol groups are relatively strong acids [ 4 ] . We have now extended the study of this new reduction method to other aldehydes and ketones; moreover, in order to gain a better understanding of the role of the cation size, we examined La3+, Lull, Y3+ and Sell; although the use of the last ion as a homogeneous catalyst in organic reactions is extremely scarce [ 5 ] , we found that it is by far the most effective in assisting this reduction. As far as the effect of the counterion is concerned, we examined the chlorides, the perchlorates and the trifluoromethansulphonates; the last one appeared to be by far the most suitable counterion. Experimental Materials Commercial chemicals were obtained from Aldrich and further purified by conventional methods where necessary. Anhydrous rare earth (III) trifluoromethenesulphonates (triflates) were prepared as reported [ 6 ] . As a typical example the synthesis of scandium triflate is described. A slight excess of scandium oxide was added to a 2 M aqueous solution of trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and heated on a steam bath to neutrality (since Sc3+ is a strong Lewis acid, Congo Red was used as indicator); the indissolved scandium oxide was filtered off and the clear solution was evaporated to dryness. The hydrated salt so obtained was then dried in vacuo (0.5 mmHg) over P20 fi in an Abderalden apparatus on refluxing water until a satisfactory analysis was obtained for the anhydrous compound. The rare earths were determined by complexometric titration with EDTA [7]. Anal. Cale. for C3F9LaO9S3: C, 6.14; La, 23.70. Found: C, 6.09; La, 23.64; H, 0.20. Cale. for C3F9Lu09S3: Lu, 28.12.

The presence of a small amount of water was not detrimental to the catalytic properties of the salts. However, anhydrous triflates are fairly hygroscopic and must be kept in a dessicator over P205 and freshly dried before using. C.B. Castellani et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 65-74 67 Aluminium triflate A preparation of anhydrous aluminium triflate has been reported [8 ]; however, for the sake of simplicity, we operated as follows. An aqueous solution of 2 M trifluoromethanesulphonic acid was treated with a slight excess of aluminium isopropogide, filtered and gently evaporated to dryness. The salt obtained in this way, dried in vacuo as described above, gave a very hygroscopic aluminium triflate hydrate. This was dissolved in isopropanol and the water content determined by Karl Fisher analysis. The dehydration was then accomplished in situ, by adding a atoichiometric amount of tetraisopropylorthocarbonate as a water scavenger. General procedure for the preparative reduction: reduction of 4- nitrobenxaldehyde The reaction conditions were optimized on the basis of several preliminary assays. Scandium triflate was preferred as catalyst since it allows shorter reaction times. 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde (0.3 mmol) in isopropanol (2.5 ml) was added to 0.05 mmol of catalyst and gently reflused in a thermostat at 85 C. The use of higher concentrations is not advisable in order to avoid side reactions as much as possible. The molar ratio catalyst: substrate -1: 6 was employed instead of 1: 3 as in the NMR studies, because of the high cost of scandium. Moreover, higher molar ratios, while not producing a dramatic decrease in the reaction times, favour the formation of by products. The same conditions were used with other rare earth salts. If hydrated salts were employed, a stoichiometric amount of tetraisopropylorthocarbonate was added as a water scavenger. A short Dufton column equipped with a CaC12 tube was used for removing the acetone formed in the reaction. This was identified as its 2,4dinitrophenylhydrazone. The reactions were followed by TLC and carried out until the starting substrate had disappeared. At the end of the reaction the solvent was removed in vacuo and the solid residue was crystallized from water. 4-Nitrobenzyl alcohol, identified by its m.p. (94 C) and 1H NMR spectrum, was obtained in 1 h in 74% isolated yield. The reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde is also clean and complete (TLC and 1H NMR) in the presence of other rare earth triflates, but requires longer times (about 4 h with anhydrous yttrium or erbium triflates;14-15 h with hydrated terbium triflate or perchlorate in the presence of tetraisopropylorthocarbonate). Reduction of other carbonyl compounds When the reduction of the carbonyl compound appeared to be clean and complete (TLC control), no attempt was made to isolate the alcohol formed. When TLC revealed other products accompanying the expected alcohol, the reaction was carried out at a larger scale and the products, separated by centrifugal radial chromatography (Chromatotron), were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, the yields were determined by GC analysis of the reaction mixture or by 1H NMR of the residue after evaporation of the solvent. 68 C.B. Castellani et al. / J. Mol.

GC analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Sigma 3B gas chromatograph by using a CP-Sil-5 CB WCOT fused silica column, length 10 m, inside diameter 0.53 mm, film thickness 1.09,4m; N2 (8 ml/min) as a carrier gas; detector 300 C; injection port 250 C; temperature program 50 C for 4 min, then increasing to 150 C at 10 C /min. The 111 NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker 300 AC NMR spectrometer; solvent i-PrOH-d8; internal standard SiMe4. Kinetic measurements were carried out at 80 C. Substrate concentration 0.13 mol; molar ratio substrate: catalyst = 3 :1. The rate constants reported in Table 1 were obtained under strictly analogous conditions. Since the unavoidable presence of small amounts of water affects the measurements to some extent, the reported values mainly indicate the relative catalytic activity. Results and Discussion To explore the reaction in detail we chose 4-nitrobenzaldehyde as a model substrate because of the activation of the formyl function by the nitro group C.B. Castellani et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 65-74 69 in the 4 position and for the easy separation and purification of the reduction product. At first the reaction was followed by 1H NMR in deuterated isopropanol at 80 C, using the molar ratio substrate: Ln3+ = 3 :1 (on the hypothesis that at least three carbonyl compound molecules may coordinate one Ln3+ ion) and the influence of the cation size and the counterion was tested by comparing hydrated lanthanum (III) chloride and perchlorate with the corresponding Lu salts. The free aldehyde was always in equilibrium with its hemiacetal and acetal,whose formation is catalyzed by lanthanoid (III) ions [ 9 ] , and the amounts of these three species decreased almost in parallel with time; in the same time the amount of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol increased almost linearly. The experimental data fitted quite well with a pseudo first-order rate law, where the concentration of the species being reduced is taken as the sum of the free aldehyde, the hemiacetal and the acetal. The rate constants obtained are reported in Table 1. Lu (C104) 3 - nH20 was by far the best of the four catalysts tested, in accordance with our previous observation that the reduction rate increases upon decrease of the cation size and by using non co-ordinating counterions [2]. We anticipated that another parameter affecting the reaction rate would be the amount of water in the lanthanoid (III) salts. In fact, since water is a very strong ligand for Ln3+ ions, it is likely to hinder their coordinating ability towards the organic functions involved in the reaction (carbonyl and hydroxyl groups). In order to verify this point, the reduction was followed in the presence of anhydrous LaC13 and, as expected, we found a reduction rate higher than with hydrated LaC13. The fact that the presence of water slows down the reaction was further confirmed (see below) by comparing the rate constants obtained in the presence of hydrated and anhydrous yttrium triflates (Table 1). Moreover, during the preparative work, it was found that the reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in the presence of anhydrous yttrium triflate was complete in about 4 h, while it was not complete after as long as 10 days if yttrium triflate hydrate was used, probably due to catalyst inactivation. The catalysis with scandium triflate is less sensitive to the presence of water of hydration; in fact, the reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or 4-methoxybenzaldehyde is complete in both the presence of anhydrous and hydrated scandium triflates (about four water molecules) but in the latter case the reaction time is almost doubled. Therefore, in order to limit the presence of water in the reaction medium as far as possible, the triflate was employed as counterion instead of the perchlorate. In fact, the dehydration of perchlorates is difficult and unreliable because of the danger of explosion; instead rare earth trifates, which are essentially as ionic as the perchlorates, can easily be obtained in almost anhydrous form [6 ] . Moreover, they are much less hygroscopic and much more soluble in polar organic solvents (DMSO, DMF, THF, alcohols, etc.) than the other rare earth salts; therefore, their use in homogeneous reactions assisted by RE` ions appears to be highly convenient [ 10 ] . 70 C.B. Castellani et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 65-74 In order to study the influence of the cation size at a deeper level, we used 1H NMR spectroscopy to follow the 4-nitrobenzaldehyde reduction in the presence of the triflates of lanthanum (III), yttrium (III), lutetium (III) and scandium (III), whose ionic radii decrease in the same order (1.05; 0.89; 0.85; 0.75 A respectively, in the coordination number 6) [ 11 ] . The rate constants obtained (Table 1) further confirm that the reduction rate increases upon decrease of the cation radius; this behaviour is presumably related to the increasing Lewis acidity of the rare earth ions [ 12 ] . The paramagnetism of the other lanthanoids prevents the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy for studying their catalytic activity but there is no reason to believe that they do not follow the same trend. In fact, the preparative reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was clean and complete using both anhydrous erbium (III) tritlate and terbium (III) triflate or perchlorate, as described in the experimental section. The importance of the ionic character of the counterion was confirmed once more following the reduction in the presence of anhydrous YC13: the rate constant is two order of magnitude smaller than that obtained with Y (OTf) 3. This result is consistent with the higher coordinating ability of Cl` with respect to Tf0- and thus with the lower Lewis acidity of YC13 with respect to Y (OTf)3. The reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde in the presence of Y (OTf) 3\"` was also carried out using molar ratios substrate: Y =1:1 and 30 :1. While in the former case the rate constant value increased only slightly, in the latter case the reaction was much slower (log K= -6.16), as has to be expected for homogeneous catalysis. Kinetic measurements were then extended to the reaction of other carbonyl substrates in the presence of Y (OTf) 3 (Table 1) . The reactions were carried out under the same experimental conditions and were followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In some cases it was not possible to prevent other byproducts being formed besides the expected alcohol. Moreover, the reduction of aliphatic aldehydes and ketones could not be followed quantitatively by 1H NMR spectroscopy due to the fast exchange reaction between the hydrogen atoms in the position a to the carbonyl group and the deuterated solvent. We then evaluated the synthetic potential of this catalytic reduction of carbonyl compounds with rare earth salts. Scandium (III) triflate was employed as a catalyst and other aldehydes and ketones, besides those included in Table 1, were considered on a preparative scale (see the preparative procedure described in the experimental section). These experiments confirmed that 4-nitrobenzaldehyde is completely reduced to 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol without formation of by products, while 4-methoxybenzaldehyde is completely converted to the ether of 4-methoxybenzyl al- *Although scandium (III) triflate appears to be the beat catalyst, yttrium (III) tritlate was preferred for the determination of the rate constants because lower reaction rates allow more precise experimental measurements.

However, TLC showed the transient presence of 4methoxybenzyl alcohol during the course of the reaction run under the standard conditions. Traces of this alcohol remained instead at the end of the reduction carried out at 40 C using scandium triflate hydrate as a catalyst. Benzaldehyde and 3-phenylpropionaldehyde give, in addition to the corresponding alcohols, traces of their mixed ethers with isopropanol (benzyl alcohol >99% yield; 3-phenylpropyl alcohol 78% yield). In the case of 3-pheny1propionaldehyde traces of an unidentified crotonization product were also formed. The conversion time to the reaction products is strongly dependent on the dryness of the reaction medium and roughly follows the order: 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (about 1 h) < 3-phenylpropionaldehyde - benzaldehyde - 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (about 2-3 h). The reduction of 2-ethylbutanal and dodecanal requires longer reaction times (more than 12 h); moreover, small amounts of unidentified by products accompany the expected alcohol. Interestingly, no ethers are formed with aliphatic aldehydes. The reaction times of the ketones examined follow the order: cyclohexanone (3 h) < 4-nitroacetophenone (6 h) < acetophenone (20 h) < 4-methoxyacetophenone (3 days). Acetophenone and 4-methoxyacetophenone react only if the reaction medium is carefully kept dry throughout the procedure. As far as the end products of the reactions are concerned, cyclohexanone and 4-nitroacetophenone are completely reduced to the corresponding alcohols while 4-methoxyacetophenone and acetophenone give the ether of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol and 1-phenylethanol with isopropanol (yield>90% ), respectively. In order to verify whether alcohol etherification also is catalyzed by rare earth ions, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 3-phenylpropyl alcohol, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol and 1-phenylethanol were refluxed in isopropanol in the presence of anhydrous scandium triflate (substrate: catalyst molar ratio=6:1): in the case of the 4-methoxysubstituted compounds the corresponding mixed isopropyl ethers were quantitatively obtained in less than 1 h*; in the case of 1-phenylethanol the etherification was complete in about 12 h, while benzyl and 3-phenylpropyl alcohols gave the corresponding ethers with isopropanol only after a few days (5-10% yield). From the reported results it is clear that rare earth triflates catalyze two reactions between carbonyl compounds and isopropanol: (i) the reduction of the C=O group; (ii) the etherification of the product alcohol with isopropanol, in the case of aromatic carbonyl compounds. The reduction rates follow the order: 4-nitrosubstituted > unsubstituted > 4-methoxysubstituted compounds, while the etherification rates follow the inverse order. Thus the reduction *The etherification of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol was also carried out in the presence of yttrium triflate; complete etherification occurred in a time almost double than with scandium triflate. 72 C.$. Castellani et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 65-74 method outlined here suffers from severe limitations for electron-rich aromatic carbonyl compounds. As far as the reduction mechanism is concerned, we believe that it is strictly analogous to that generally accepted for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction [ 13 ] (Scheme 1) on the basis of the following observations. . R' W R i:r% H. R R% R R - R ~~ i - R H o, .o~~ o. o ~ ,o. .o `ir ILn3+ , H Ln3. HLn3+ Scheme 1. (i) In the case of aromatic carbonyl compounds, the decrease of the rate constants in the order 4-nitro > 4-unsubstituted > 4-methoxy derivatives is in agreement with a mechanism which requires the nucleophilic attack of a hydride ion on the carbonyl group, whose electrophilicity is enhanced by electron withdrawing groups in a para position. (ii) The comparison of the reaction rates of analogous aldehydes and ketones (for instance 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitroacetophenone) shows that the former compounds are reduced more easily than the latter. This is in agreement with the steric and electronic effects favouring the aldehyde group and with the observation that aldehyde carbonyls are much more activated by lanthanoid ions than keto carbonyls [ 9 ] . Therefore, the rare earth cations play a double role: (i) they give rise to an incipient alkoxide through coordination to the alcohol hydroxyl oxygen atom; (ii) they activate the carbonyl group through coordination to the carbonyl oxygen. Since presumably both the alcohol and the carbonyl compound are coordinated to the same rare earth cation, this accomplishes a template function, too. Eventually the reduction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was carried out under anhydrous conditions in the presence of aluminium triflate in order to compare the Sc3+ catalytic activity with that of a metal ion having the same charge and a smaller radius and not belonging to a transition series. Moreover, it seemed advisable to compare the behaviour of aluminium triflate with that of aluminium isopropoxide, which is the reagent commonly used for MPV reduction. Although some 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol was detectable by TLC, the reaction was much slower than in the presence of scandium triflate; in fact a large amount of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was still present after 9 h, accompanied by many unidentified products. A reason for the different behaviour of aluminium and scandium triflates might be found in a more favorable energy level of the scandium orbitals available for coordinative bonds due to the higher effective nuclear charge of scandium compared to that of aluminium [ 14 ] . As far as the formation of ethers is concerned, ether formation catalyzed by SMC13 has already been reported for allylic alcohols by Kagan and cowork- C.B. Castellani et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 85 (1993) 65-74 73 ers [ 15 ] . Our results show that other rare earth (III) cations and other kinds of alcohols show the same behaviour. Incidentally, we noted that, during our attempts to obtain the Oppenhauer reaction assisted by rare earth (III) cations, the double ether of cholesterol (which is not an allylic alcohol) was obtained.* These results might be interpreted in terms of a mechanism (roughly represented in Scheme 2) which involves the activation of both alcoholic groups by coordination to the rare earth cation. s+ s+ H Ln 3+ Meo-- s+ CH2__-o Me0 CHZOH - M Ln3' O Me~ , H Scheme 2. According to this SNl borderline mechanism, a positive charge must develop to a considerable extent on the carbinol atom attacked by the activated isopropanol. Therefore, only double bonds and aromatic rings activated by electron donating groups can provide the necessary stabilization through conjugation (in allylic and benzylic alcohols respectively) or n-back donation effects (in cholesterol and 3-phenylpropanol). Conclusions Scandium (III), which has very seldom been employed before as a homogeneous catalyst for organic reactions, seems to be very promising in this regard. In fact, it is by far the most efficient of the rare earth (III) cations in the MPV reduction, presumably because it possesses the smallest radius. A great advantage is offered by its diamagnetism (shared only by La'+, ya+, Lus+ ) which allows the reactions to be easily followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The limitations imposed by its high cost can be overcome by recovering it with conventional methods. Coupling its features with the unique character of triflate as counterion, it can be foreseen that several other catalytic reactions methods could be developed. *All efforts at achieving the oxidation of alcohols by ketones in the presence of rare earth salts (chlorides, perchlorates, triflates) were unsuccessful. In our opinion this strongly supports the hypothesis that the active species in the redox process is the incipient alkoxide, whose concentration can reach sufficient levels only if the alcohol behaves both as the reducing agent and the solvent. 74 C.B.

Anna Gamba Invernizzi Giovanni Vidari Dipartimento di Chimica Organica, Università di Pavia, Via Taramelli 10, 27100, Pavia Italy Rare earth cations catalyze the reduction of aldehydes and ketones by isopropanol. The reaction rate constants have been determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy in the presence of La3+, Y3+, Lu3+, Sc3+, using Cl−, ClO4 − and TfO− as counterions; the values obtained indicate that the reaction rates increase as the cation size decreases and with the use of poorly co-ordinating counterions. Scandium trifluoromethanesulphonate turned out to be by far the best catalyst for these reactions. By comparison of strictly analogous aldehydes and ketones it has been found that the former compounds are more easily reduced than the latter. The formation of mixed ethers with isopropanol was observed during the reduction of aromatic carbonyl compounds substituted with electron donating groups.
