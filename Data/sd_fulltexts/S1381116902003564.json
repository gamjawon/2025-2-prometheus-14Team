Calcined Mg–Al, Mg–Cr and Zn–Al hydrotalcite catalysts for tert-butylation of phenol with iso-butanol—a comparative study A.H Padmasri A Venugopal V Durga Kumari K.S Rama Rao P Kanta Rao ∗ Catalysis and Physical Chemistry Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad 500007, India * Corresponding author. Fax: +91-40-716-3757. t-Butylation of phenol was studied using iso-butanol over mixed oxides obtained through calcination of Mg–Al (MA), Mg–Cr (MC) and Zn–Al (ZA) hydrotalcites with M2+/M3+=2, at the reaction temperatures ranging from 350 to 500°C. The unusual formation of butenyl phenols along with the formation of butyl phenols was observed over these catalysts. The activities of the catalysts were found to be higher compared to their individual oxides and the order of reactivity of these three calcined hydrotalcites (CHTs) is in the order CMA-HT>CZA-HT>CMC-HT. Acid–base properties of the catalysts were found to influence their activities for tertiary butylation of phenols. Based on the results a probable mechanism is proposed for the formation of butenyl phenols. Calcined hydrotalcites (CHTs) are studied for the tert-butylation of phenol using iso-butanol in the temperatures ranging from 350 to 500°C. The major products of this reaction on calcined magnesium–aluminium hydrotalcites (CMA-HTs) are O-tert-butyl phenol (tert-butyl phenyl ether, OTBP) and 2-tert-butyl phenol (o-tert-butyl phenol, 2TBP) with O-butenyl phenol (butenyl phenyl ether, OBP) and 2-butenyl phenol (o-butenyl phenol, 2BP) as useful by-products. With a view to understand the reaction mechanism and the reaction path, tert-butylation of phenol is studied by changing both Mg[M(II)] and Al[M(III)] ions with Zn2+ and Cr3+, respectively. Thus, Mg–Al (MA), Mg–Cr (MC) and Zn–Al (ZA) hydrotalcites (with M2+:M3+ ratio=2) are prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), differential thermal analysis/thermo gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG), BET-surface area (BET-SA) and acidity–basicity measurements (temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2). Mixed oxides obtained from CHTs are found to be more active over their individual oxides for the tert-butylation of phenol. The butylation activities of the three different CHTs are in the order CMA-HT>CZA-HT>CMC-HT. A different product distribution is obtained over calcined Mg–Cr and Zn–Al hydrotalcites for the tert-butylation of phenol showing the influence of acid–base properties on the activity of the catalysts. A probable mechanism based on the experimental observations has been proposed in order to explain the formation of butenyl phenols. Keywords Calcined hydrotalcite Acid–base properties tert-Butylation Butyl phenols Butenyl phenols 1 Introduction Hydrotalcite (HT) or hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) are layered double hydroxides belonging to the class of anionic clays. The structure of these compounds are very similar to that of brucite, Mg(OH)2, where some of Mg2+ represented as [M(II)] are isomorphously replaced by Al3+ represented as [M(III)] and the net positive charge is compensated by the inter-layered exchangeable anion (A n−). The general formula of these compounds can be represented as: [M(II)1−x M(III)x(OH)2]·A x/n n−·mH 2 O The structure can accommodate wide variations in different M(II) ions, M(III) ions and mixture of M(III) and M(II) ions, M(II):M(III) atomic ratios (represented by x=M(III)/M(II)+M(III) ranging from 0.1 to 0.33), different types of inter-layered anions with charge from −1 to −3, crystal morphology and size [1]. A possibility of incorporation of M+ and M4+ ions has also been reported in the synthesis of these compounds [2,3]. Thermal decomposition of these materials by calcination above 450°C results in the formation of a high surface area basic mixed oxides which are reported to be potential candidates in catalyzing various reactions involved in the synthesis of a variety of fine chemicals [4–7]. In an earlier publication, we found that calcined magnesium–aluminium hydrotalcites (CMA-HTs) are active for the tert-butylation of phenol with iso-butanol [8]. The tert-butylation of phenol is an industrially important reaction to produce tert-butyl phenols, which are important starting materials in the synthesis of antioxidants, agrochemicals, pharmaceutical intermediates, thermo-resistant polymers, protecting agents for plastics and fragrance compounds. The other products, like O-butyl and butenyl phenols also find application in the synthesis of flavoring, fragrance compounds and pharmaceutical intermediates, chromans [9]. The by-product, 2-ethyl hexanal obtained over the CMC- and CZA-HTs is also reported to be useful in the synthesis of 2-ethyl hexenol which is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of plasticizers and cetane improvers, lubricant additives, surfactants, etc. [9]. In liquid phase, this reaction is generally carried out over acid catalysts, like AlCl3, ion-exchange resins and super acid catalysts, like Nafion-H, sulfated zirconia [10–13] using iso-butene or iso-/tert-butanols and in vapor phase on zeolite catalysts with iso-/tert-butanols [14–16]. The conventional acidic catalysts employed are environmentally hazardous and although cation-exchange resins do not pollute the environment, they involve a tedious work-up and are unstable at higher temperatures. These catalysts produce a mixture of o-, p- and m-butylated products or predominantly para products. Although catalysts like γ-Al2O3 are more ortho selective [9], they undergo significant deactivation with time-on-stream. In our recent study [8], over solid base catalysts, CMA-HTs, we found them to be more active for tert-butylation of phenol than that over MgO and γ-Al2O3 and the formation of unusual products, like butenyl phenols is also observed over these catalysts. The present investigation is aimed at the study of the effect of substitution of Mg2+ by Zn2+ and Al3+ by Cr3+ in the MA-HT structure on the butylation activity of the catalysts. The catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET-surface area (BET-SA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), differential thermal analysis/thermo gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2. The acid–base properties of these catalysts are correlated with the product distribution and a probable mechanism for the formation of butenyl phenols is proposed based on these studies. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of catalysts All the HT catalysts used in this study are prepared using Reichle’s method [5] with M(II):M(III) atomic ratio of 2 by co-precipitation at room temperature (at 65±5°C in case of MC-HT) from the aqueous solutions of their corresponding nitrates with a mixture of aqueous solutions of NaOH and Na2CO3 at a pH=∼11. The precipitate is then subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 65±5°C for 18h and the resultant gel obtained after thorough washing (until Na content is <0.1wt.%) and filtration is dried in an oven at 110°C overnight. The dried samples are calcined in air for 18h at 500°C and termed as calcined Mg–Al (CMA), calcined Mg–Cr (CMC) and calcined Zn–Al (CZA) HTs. To compare the activities of these catalysts with their corresponding pure oxides, MgO, Cr2O3 and ZnO are also prepared by precipitation using aqueous NaOH in the case of MgO and aqueous NH3 in the case of Cr2O3 and ZnO from their corresponding aqueous nitrate salt solutions followed by calcination in air (N2 for Cr2O3) at 500, 500 and 450°C, respectively, for 5h. γ-Al2O3 used is a commercial (Harshaw) catalyst. The catalysts are pelletized, crushed and sieved to 18/20 BSS mesh before use. To study the effect of preparation conditions on the t-butylation of phenol, another MA-HT was prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 65±5°C for 1h and calcining the oven dried gel at 500°C for 8h in air to get CMA-1. 2.2 Characterization and activity study The XRD patterns are obtained from a Siemens D-5000 powder X-ray diffractometer using nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5405Å). The XPS spectra of the hydrotalcites are recorded on a Kratos axis 165 spectrometer equipped with a Mg Kα source. The binding energy (B.E.) correction is performed by using the C with 1s peak at 284.6eV as a reference. The B.E.s were determined and the relative intensities of the surface composition of different elements are measured by correcting them with their corresponding atomic sensitivity factors using Vision 2 software in Unix system. The bulk composition of the M(II) and M(III) ions are determined by AAS (Perkin-Elmer A Analyst 300). The DTA/TG profiles are recorded on a Metler Toledo 851E (Switzerland) instrument at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 both in air and N2. BET-SAs of the catalysts are measured on an all glass high vacuum system (10−6 Torr) by N2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature. Acidity and basicity measurements are carried out by TPD of NH3 and CO2, respectively, using a micro-reactor assembly. Typically about 200mg of the catalyst is secured between quartz wool plugs in the micro-reactor, pre-treated in nitrogen at 450°C for 3h and then cooled to 80°C prior to the adsorption of NH3 or CO2 at this temperature. After the adsorption of NH3 or CO2 (40mlmin−1) for 60min, the catalyst is flushed with nitrogen (40mlmin−1) for 60min at 100°C to remove the physisorbed gas from the surface of the catalyst. The desorption pattern has been recorded at a heating ramp of 12°Cmin−1 from 80 to 500°C using a recorder connected to a GC equipped with a TCD detector. The vapour phase tert-butylation of phenol using iso-butanol is carried out in a vertical fixed bed glass reactor using ∼1g of catalyst at the reaction temperatures ranging from 350 to 500°C. A feed mixture of phenol:iso-butanol (1:7) is fed to the catalyst at a rate of 4mlh−1 using a microprocessor controlled syringe pump (B. Braun, Germany) [8]. The products are cooled, collected and analyzed by a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector using a 10% SE-30 column (2.5 m×3 mm, SS). The products are confirmed by GC–MS (Varian 7070). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 XRD, BET-SA, acidity and basicity measurements Fig. 1(A–C) show the XRD patterns of MA-, ZA- and MC-HTs both uncalcined and calcined varieties. All the uncalcined samples show hydrotalcite structure. The lattice parameters calculated for the MA-HT are a=3.050Å and c=22.953Å for the sample treated hydrothermally for 1h and for the sample that is treated for 18h, the values are a=3.048Å and c=22.980Å. These values changed with the substitution of Mg2+ by Zn2+ in HT structure to a=3.070Å and c=22.596Å and on the substitution of Al3+ by Cr3+ to a=3.096Å and c=23.697Å. Upon calcinations the MA-HT catalysts show only poorly crystalline MgO phase (d=2.11, 1.49, 1.22Å; ASTM no. 4-0829). The CMC-HT, shows in addition to MgO, MgCrO4 phase (d=5.0, 3.77, 6.0, 10.8Å; ASTM no. 1-0243) also. Only ZnO phase (d=2.48, 2.82, 2.60Å; ASTM no. 5-664) is observed in CZA-HT catalyst. Table 1 shows the BET-SA and NH3 and CO2 uptakes of various catalysts. NH3 uptake of the catalysts shows the presence of acidity of different strengths and is found to be very high in ZA-HT indicating that the substitution by Zn2+ enhances the acidity of the catalyst. On MC-HT, both the NH3 and CO2 uptakes are found to be very low in comparison to other HTs indicating that substitution of Al3+ by Cr3+ resulted in a drastic reduction of the acid–base properties of the catalyst. This behavior may be attributed to the formation of MgCrO4 spinel in this catalyst which also may be the reason for the lower activity of the catalyst towards butylation of phenol. According to Di Cosimo et al. [17] while pure MgO possesses strong basic sites consisting predominantly of O2−, calcined hydrotalcites contain surface sites of low (OH− groups), medium (Mg-O pairs), and strong (O2−) basicities. Our experimental results on TPD of CO2 conform to this viewpoint. The basic sites in the temperature range of 200–300°C are designated as of low strength, the sites in the range of 300–400°C as of medium strength and those in the range of 400–500°C as high strength ones. It is observed that while the density of high temperature basic sites (>400°C) is greater in MgO catalyst, the CMA-HTs showed relatively more density of low strength basic sites in comparison to the basic sites of other strengths. This behavior may be attributed to the formation of weakly basic OH groups on CHT with the incorporation of Al3+ in the brucite layer resulting in the lowering of the average surface strength of basicity [17]. These differences in site densities may be the reason for the low temperature activity seen on CHT catalysts and high temperature activity that is (above 450°C) seen on MgO catalyst [18]. The total basicity per unit surface area of the catalysts showed the following order: MgO>CMA-1⪢CMA>CZA>Al2O3>CMC, and the acidity in the following order: CZA>CMA>CMA-1>Al2O3≈MgO>CMC. The CMA-HTs showed higher acidity as compared to MgO. This may be the probable reason for the CMA-HT to have shown higher activity towards butylation of phenol than by MgO as the reaction is reported [7] to take place by the participation of acid–base pairs. The CZA catalyst although showed the highest acidity among all the catalysts studied, this acidity seems to correspond to high strength sites which probably do not contribute to this particular reaction. This is further confirmed by the formation of other products of condensation and dehyrogenation observed in good measure over this catalyst. The basicity:acidity ratio is the highest on MgO followed by CMA-1, which appears to be the most basic among all the hydrotalcites studied here, even more basic than CMA. The acidity of CMA is higher than that of CMA-1 probably due to the contribution of more surface enriched Al3+ towards acidity as a result of longer hours of hydrothermal treatment given to CMA during the preparation step. 3.2 XPS and AAS results Table 2 shows the surface and bulk compositions of hydrotalcites determined by XPS and AAS techniques, respectively. Fig. 2 shows X-ray photoelectron spectra of different hydrotalcites. The binding energies of M(II) and M(III) ions (Fig. 2) suggest their existence in hydroxide form. The Mg 2p B.E. value is found to be around 50.0eV in all the Mg containing HTs and the Al 2p B.E. is observed to be 74.0eV in MA- and ZA-HT samples. The Cr 2p B.E. value is 578.0eV in MC-HT sample. The B.E. value of 1s of O (532.0eV) also indicates it to be present in hydroxide form. No significant change in the B.E. of 1s of O is observed corresponding to the substitution of Zn2+ or Cr3+ in the original HT structure, i.e. w.r.t. ZA- and MC-HTs. The bulk atomic ratios of M(II):M(III) determined by AAS are close to ‘2’. But a surface enrichment of Al3+ is observed in case of MA-HT with lower Mg:Al atomic ratio (1.15) as evident from XPS analysis. Di Cosimo et al. [17] showed that increasing Al content in CHT samples, segregation of Al3+ to the surface takes place as observed from the increase in Als:Alb ratios. The surface M(II):M(III) atomic ratios in the other hydrotalcites, viz. MC- and ZA-HTs determined by XPS are close to their bulk compositions as obtained from AAS. The main peak of 1s of C observed at a B.E. value of 285.0eV and another one around 289.0eV in all the samples clearly suggest the presence of carbonate anion in the structure of HT. Sachez et al. [19] observed a small difference of about 0.5eV between MgFe- and MA-HTs in the O 1s B.E. These compounds are reported to have shown a difference of 0.9eV shift to lower energy and an increase in their basicity upon decarbonation. Upon rehydration these materials have also shown higher basicity than that of MgO. From calorimetric measurements, the heat of adsorption of CO2 (110kJmol−1) is found to be the same for CHTs and MgO [19]. Figueras et al. [20,21] have reported high activities for the aldolisation and Michael reactions over the rehydrated or modified MA-HTs. 3.3 DTA/TG Fig. 3 illustrates the DTA/TG curves of the three different HTs synthesized with M(II):M(III) atomic ratio=2, recorded in air and N2. Two major endothermic peaks are observed in all the HTs recorded both in air and N2 corresponding to the two stages of weight decrease. Except for MC-HT, all the samples exhibited similar DTA patterns in both the atmospheres (N2 and air). However, a slight shift in the t max towards lower temperatures is observed in all the samples recorded in N2, which is more pronounced in MC-HT. The first endotherm corresponds to the loss of inter-layer water and, the second one is attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups from the brucite-like layer as well as of the anion (CO3 2−) in MA-HT [22]. A very broad, small endothermic peak around 350°C (before the second main transition) is also observed in MA-HT sample. This may be assigned to the loss of part of the OH− in the brucite-like layer [23]. Two low temperature peaks at 205 and 260°C and a high temperature peak at 820°C are observed in ZA-HT samples. The peaks at 205 and 260°C are attributed to the loss of interlayer water and de-hydroxylation due to the loss of OH− in the brucite-like layer and loss of inter-layered anion (CO3 2−), respectively [24,25]. The high temperature peak at 820°C may be attributed to the heat absorbed during the formation of spinel (ZnAl2O4) phase at this temperature. The XRD analysis of ZA-HT calcined at 900°C in air for 5h confirmed the formation of ZnAl2O4 (ASTM no. 5-669). In MC-HT samples, first weight loss due to removal of molecular water is seen to extend from room temperature up to 200°C. We observed only a single and a very broad endotherm in the DTA profiles unlike Kooli et al. [26] who reported to have observed two peaks at 118 and 240°C probably due to the differences in the preparation conditions adopted. Kooli et al. [26] have hydrothermally treated the precipitated sample at 120°C for 48h, whereas, we have prepared the MC-HT by hydrothermal treatment at 65±5°C for 18h. A second weight loss is observed from the broad endothermic peak with a t max=360°C in the sample recorded in N2 and at 400°C for the sample recorded in air. This weight loss may be ascribed to removal of hydroxyl groups from the layers and CO2 from carbonate species in the interlayer space. An additional endotherm around 580°C is also observed in the sample recorded in air, which may be attributed to the redox process of the chromium ions [26]. Confirmation of this is evidenced from the absence of this transition in the profile recorded in nitrogen. 3.4 tert-Butylation of phenol over CMA-, CMC- and CZA-HTs The tert-butylation of phenol has been carried out on two different CMA-HTs prepared by varying the preparation conditions. It is found that the catalyst, CMA prepared by hydrothermal treatment for 18h and calcined in air for 18h showed higher butylation activity as compared to that of the CMA-1, which is hydrothermally treated for 1h and calcined for 8h in air. The difference in the activity probably corresponds to the difference in their acidities and basicities as seen from Table 1. Thus, the other two HT catalysts, viz. CMC- and CZA-HTs, are prepared identical to that of CMA-HT. Fig. 4 shows the effect of temperature on the t-butylation activity and the product selectivities over the three different CHTs, viz. CMA, CMC and CZA. It is observed that the substitution of Mg2+ and Al3+ by Zn2+ and Cr3+ influences the conversion of phenol as well as the selectivity to various products. Although, CZA showed good activity corresponding to the high basicity and enhanced acidity of the catalyst, CMC showed a lower activity probably due to a drastic decrease in the acidity and basicity of the catalyst by Cr3+ substitution. There is an increase in the activity with temperature in all the catalysts, except that there is a slight decrease in the activity above 450°C in CMC and CZA catalysts, which may be the result of increased dehydration of alcohol, and consequent coking over these catalysts. From these results, a reaction temperature of 450°C appears to be optimum for the t-butylation of phenol. The reaction has been found to attain steady state in ∼1h. When the reaction is continued for a further period of 5h, the conversion and selectivity levels were found to be nearly steady on all the catalysts. The absence of formation of OTBP and 2TBP over CMC catalyst may be attributed to the absence of good amount of strong basic and acidic sites required for the formation of these products [27,28]. In CZA, although the basicity is observed to be high, this basicity seems to be involved more in other reactions, viz. dehydrogenation and condensation. The other products that are obtained in good amounts and identified to be the dehydrogenation and condensation products, viz. phenyl butyrate, 2-ethyl hexanal and 2-methyl propyl ester from GC–MS analysis over this catalyst suggest that the strong basic sites available on this catalyst are somewhat different from those available on MgO or mixed oxides of CMA and CMC. The formation of 2TBP over CMA at higher temperatures may be attributed to the availability of strong basic sites of MgO at higher temperatures [18]. The formation of OBP and 2BP over all the three catalysts also confirms the formation of these compounds by the combined action of acid–base pairs present on these catalysts as evidenced from the NH3 and CO2 uptakes. Table 3 shows the comparative activities of different catalysts towards tert-butylation of phenol studied at the optimum reaction temperature of 450°C. It is evident from this table that the mixed oxides obtained by the calcination of the HTs are more active than their corresponding individual oxides for the t-butylation of phenol. In fact, the conversion of phenol over Cr2O3 and ZnO is nil. Table 4 shows the selectivities of various products at an iso-conversion of phenol at ∼30% on the three different hydrotalcites studied in the temperature ranges of 400–450°C. Formation of OBP is seen on all the catalysts and 2BP did not form over CMA at the studied reaction temperature (400°C). The formation of 2TBP is seen to be absent on all the catalysts at this level of conversion of phenol. In general, alkylation of phenol is a reaction sensitive to the acid–base properties of the catalysts employed. It has been reported that while O-alkylation of phenol is favored by the strong acid sites of the catalyst [27,28], C-alkylation is promoted by weak acidic or strong basic sites [29–31]. According to another report O-alkylation of phenol is favored by weak acidic sites [32]. It is also reported that methylation of phenol over CHTs takes place by the combined action of acid–base sites of the catalysts [7]. In our earlier [8] and the present study, alkylation of phenol using iso-butanol is found to yield other products, namely butenyl phenols in good amounts besides O-tert-butyl phenol and 2-tert-butyl phenol over CHTs. Acid–base properties of CHTs appear to be important for the tert-butylation of phenol and the obtained product distribution may be explained in terms of mode of adsorption of phenol over the different acid–base sites available. Marczewski et al. [32] reported that methanol which is more basic than phenol, is adsorbed on protonic centers of acid catalysts as CH3O+H2, resulting in the formation of anisole by the reaction between adsorbed methanol and either phenol in the gas phase or phenol adsorbed on weak acidic sites. Tanabe and Nishizaki [30] proposed two different modes of adsorption on acidic and basic sites. On MgO which is very weakly acidic, the phenol is shown to adsorb in the form of phenolate ion in a vertical mode of adsorption with the benzene ring held perpendicular to the catalyst surface and on SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst with high acid strength, the acid sites are shown to interact with the π-electrons of the benzene ring showing a horizontal mode of adsorption with the benzene ring parallel to the catalyst surface. This is reported to be the reason for the high selectivity towards ortho product over MgO catalysts and the formation of various other isomers over SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst. Thus, the mode of adsorption which is governed by the acid–base strengths of the catalysts in turn seem to influence or control the selectivities of the products. The possible formation of various products may, thus be explained in terms of the two modes of adsorption of phenol over the acid–base sites. The formation of normal products, OTBP and 2TBP may occur due to the action of both acidic and basic sites of HT. A plausible mechanism (Fig. 5 ) has been proposed for the formation of OBP and 2BP, based on the present observations and earlier studies on the tert-butylation of phenol. Solid base catalysts, such as MgO are highly selective for the hydrogen transfer from alcohols to carbonyl compounds through a mechanism similar to that of the Meerwin–Ponndorf–Verley reaction [33,34]. It has also been reported that if alkoxide intermediates are formed on the surface, they dehydrate into olefins on acidic sites [35,36] and dehydrogenate on basic sites [37,38]. Figueras et al. [39] have shown that in the dehyrogenation of methanol and t-butanol over alumina and silica–alumina catalysts, alumina which has a basic character, is more active than silica–alumina. They found the inhibition of dehydration activity upon poisoning the basic sites by pyridine, Na+ or tetracyano ethylene and suggested that the reaction requires both acidic and basic sites. Therefore, one would expect from the dehydrogenation of tert-butyl phenols, (the normal products of tert-butylation) to yield the butenyl phenols. It may be mentioned here that the reaction of 2-tert-butyl phenol on CMA-HTs at 450°C, did not produce any 2-butenyl phenol ruling out the possibility of formation of butenyl phenols through this route. So, it is proposed that iso-butanol adsorbs as an alkoxide over MgO or CHT and dehydrogenate forming an intermediate similar to that of iso-butyraldehyde (in adsorbed form). This intermediate reacts with phenol, either in gas phase or in horizontal mode of adsorption (over the acidic sites of the catalysts) forming O-butenyl phenol. The formation of 2BP is possible in the same way wherein the intermediate in this case reacts with the phenol, in vertical mode of adsorption over the basic sites of the catalyst. 4 Conclusions Mixed oxides obtained from CHTs are found to be more active than their individual oxides for the tert-butylation of phenol. The butylation activities of the three different HTs are in the order: CMA>CZA>CMC. The substitution of Al3+ by Cr3+ has resulted in the drastic reduction of acid–base properties of CMC accounting for the lower activity in the tert-butylation of phenol. The substitution of Mg2+ by Zn2+ resulted in the enhanced acidity of the hydrotalcite formed and has also shown a good basicity and activity. But, this basicity and acidity of the catalyst seemed to contribute to the side reactions giving rise to dehydrogenation and condensation products lowering the selectivities towards butylation products. A probable mechanism has been proposed for the formation of butenyl phenols based on the correlation obtained between the acid–base properties of the catalysts and product distribution. This study has also shown that it is possible to design a suitable catalyst at chosen reaction conditions to get a desired product of tert-butyl or -butenyl phenol and/or condensation products.

        "dc:description": "Calcined hydrotalcites (CHTs) are studied for the tert-butylation of phenol using iso-butanol in the temperatures ranging from 350 to 500°C. The major products of this reaction on calcined magnesium–aluminium hydrotalcites (CMA-HTs) are O-tert-butyl phenol (tert-butyl phenyl ether, OTBP) and 2-tert-butyl phenol (o-tert-butyl phenol, 2TBP) with O-butenyl phenol (butenyl phenyl ether, OBP) and 2-butenyl phenol (o-butenyl phenol, 2BP) as useful by-products. With a view to understand the reaction mechanism and the reaction path, tert-butylation of phenol is studied by changing both Mg[M(II)] and Al[M(III)] ions with Zn2+ and Cr3+, respectively. Thus, Mg–Al (MA), Mg–Cr (MC) and Zn–Al (ZA) hydrotalcites (with M2+:M3+ ratio=2) are prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), differential thermal analysis/thermo gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG), BET-surface area (BET-SA) and acidity–basicity measurements (temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2). Mixed oxides obtained from CHTs are found to be more active over their individual oxides for the tert-butylation of phenol. The butylation activities of the three different CHTs are in the order CMA-HT>CZA-HT>CMC-HT. A different product distribution is obtained over calcined Mg–Cr and Zn–Al hydrotalcites for the tert-butylation of phenol showing the influence of acid–base properties on the activity of the catalysts. A probable mechanism based on the experimental observations has been proposed in order to explain the formation of butenyl phenols.",
