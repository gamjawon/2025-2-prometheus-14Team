DOMI'NGUEZ Institute Mexicano del Petr6leo, IBP, Apartado Postal 14-805, Eje Ldzaro Cardenas #152, C.P. 07730 (Mexico) (Received December 8, 1988; accepted January 13,1989) Summary The phase relationships and structure of Sb Sn 0 and Sb Sn Cu 0 oxidation type catalysts were determined by means of X-ray diffraction, small angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy techniques. The addi- tion of Cu to the Sb Sn 0-based catalysts seems to inhibit the sintering of the solid, but it avoids the formation of weak metal-oxygen bonds, i.e. Sb(III) 0. The fundamental difference between monometallic oxides and mixed phases is the preferred development of (020) and (001) type faces, which could be relevant for the partial oxidation selectivity properties of the catalysts. Introduction Catalysts based upon the solid state mixture of antimony-tin-oxygen have been widely used in the partial oxidation of propylene towards acrolein and in the ammoxidation reaction. However, from a fundamental point of view several questions concerning the reaction mechanism [1] and the active mixed phases remain unanswered. For example, it is not well understood why the monometallic Sb 0 and Sn 0 oxides are not as active and select- ive as the mixed phases [2, 3], or why the addition of Fe'''3 [4] has such a strong effect on the catalytic properties or whether the introduction of a foreign cation affects the structure and dispersion of the more active phases, or even if the valence state of the antimony [5-9] is modified by the inser- tion of a third element. In view of this, the present work aimed first to char- acterize some parameters such as the metal-oxygen bond strength, coordina- tion number and the aggregation state of the active phases, which might have some influence on the catalytic properties of the Sb Sn 0-based solids. Secondly, a divalent cation, i.e. copper, was added to the Sb Sn 0 mixed phase in order to compare the textural and structural properties of the solid * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 264 with respect to those obtained by Fe'1'3 substitution [4]. Iron ensures a higher concentration of Sb*5 and inhibits the formation of a-SbaC^ crystals [3]. It was expected that copper would interact with the Sb Sn 0 system in a different way than does Fe, due to its smaller atomic radius; indeed, it was believed that, more important than valence state in deciding whether two atomic species can replace one another, is the atomic or ionic size; in general, the smaller the size misfit, the greater the tendency to randomness, and the wider the range of true solid solutions [10]. In the Sb Sn 0 system, copper, being divalent, should tend to occupy specific sites only in the SnOa-type structure, and the formation of mixed solid solutions Sb Sn 0 should be inhibited. Copper can also react and form the CuSb^Oe phase in which Sb is +5; here the consequence should be a higher concentra- tion of Sb'1'3, and in this way the effect is opposite to that of iron addition (i.e. higher Sb\"*\"5 concentration). Thus, a series of catalysts with a constant atomic ratio, i.e. Sb/Sn = 4, was prepared and studied. This series has been reported to exhibit a marked selectivity to acrolein which depends only on the calcination temperature of the catalyst [11]. In the present case, the Sb Sn 0 and the Sb Sn Cu 0 catalysts were calcined at 500 and 850 C for comparison. Experimental Preparation The precursors of the mixed phase catalysts were a-Sb204 (cervantite) and SnO^. The atomic ratio in the Sb Sn 0 catalyst was 16:4. SbjO^ (Baker) and metallic tin (Monterrey) were mixed and attacked with HNOa at 100 C. The precipitate was filtered, washed (distilled water) and dried at 110 C. Then the sample was calcined in air at 20 C h~1 heating rate and 50 1 h~1 kg\"1 flux. When the calcining temperature was reached (500 or 850 C), the calcination time was 18 h. The nominal Sb Sn Cu 0 was 16:4:1 in atomic composition and again, the SbaOa and the metallic Sn were treated wtih nitric acid at 100 C. The precipitate was washed and filtered, and a suspension in water was obtained. An aqueous solution of N03)2'3HaO (Baker) was added, and a precipitate was obtained with NH^OH (Baker) at controlled pH. The solid was dried and washed as above. X-ray diffraction techniques Identification of compounds: the sample diffractograms were obtained with a copper anticathode tube coupled to a Siemens goniometer. The monochromator provided a Cu Ka- radiation. The crystalline compounds whose concentration was higher than about 3% were identified using the JCPDS indexes in the conventional way [12]. The samples were mixed with a ZnO standard for precise determination of the lattice parameters. The 26 positions of the diffraction peaks were 266 corrected, so that exact values of the interplanar distances were obtained. Thus, it was possible to determine the cell parameters for the known crystal- line compounds. Radial distribution function: the diffractograms were obtained, in this case, with a molybdenum anticathode X-ray tube (Mo Ka), permitting high values of the angular parameter (S = 4 n sen Q/\\, where 6 is the diffraction angle and X the wavelength). The intensities, read at intervals of A 26 = (1/8) , from 26 = 3 to 20 = 130 , were the input data for the Magini and Cabrini program [13]. Small angle X-ray scattering: the SAXS measurements were obtained with a Kratky camera, coupled to a copper anticathode X-ray tube. A gra- phite monochromator selected the Cu K.a radiation. As the beam was 'infin- itely high', the specific surface and the particle size distribution were obtained in the two-phase' case [14,15]. Electron microscopy techniques The pure SbaO^ and SnOa phases, together with the mixed oxides of general form Sb^ Sny O^+y) were characterized in a JEOL-100 CX transmission electron microscope. The morphology and structure of these systems were studied by bright and dark field techniques as well as by elec- tron diffraction. Thus, distinct features were noticed with respect to the interaction of the main phases in the calcined catalysts. Some complemen- tary images were obtained in a scanning electron microscope. Surface science techniques The catalysts were studied with an XPS Physics Electronics instrument. The ratios Sb/(Sb + Sn) and Cu/(Sb + Sn + Cu) were determined and com- pared to values obtained by atomic absorption. Results Main phases No evidence of crystalline phases was found from X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts Sb Sn 0 or Cu Sb Sn 0 that were calcined at 500 C, whereas those treated at 850 C showed a series of accurate peaks, Fig. 1, whose positions corresponded to a-Sb204 (JCPDS card 11-695). The (020) peak turned out to be the most intense. Also, the Cu SbaOs phase appeared in the Cu Sb Sn 0 (850 C) sample. The bright-field images of the pure phases, i.e. Sb^O^ and SnOi, show that the samples are comprised of thick aggregates with irregular shapes, often opaque to the beam, Fig. 2. On the other hand, the mixed phases have distinct features according to the thermal treatment. The samples which were calcined at 500 C are formed mainly of thick aggregates, while the samples calcined at 850 C show up as thin platelets formed by an inter- connected network of small domains of about 150 A diameter, Fig. 3. 8 16 24 40 Angle (29) Fig.l.

These platelets are polycrystalline, as evidenced from the electron diffraction patterns. Fig. 4. Cell parameters As explained previously, the cell parameters of the a-Sb^O^ structures were measured by X-ray diffraction through an internal ZnO standard. In Table 1 and Fig. 5, these parameters are compared to those reported in the JCPDS cards. A contraction of about 0.8% in OQ was noticed for the Sb Sn 0 (850 C) catalyst, which could be interpreted as due to the substi- 267 (b) Fig. 3.

Elsewhere [6], a variation of 0.02 A in the (211) interplanar distance has been said to be significant. Such an interpreta- tion, however, can be rejected because Thomton [16] reports the parameters for a-Sb204: OQ = 5.456 A, by = 4.814 A and Cy = 11.787 A and the JCPDS card reports for cervantite (a-Sb204): ay = 5.436 A, by = 4.810 A and Cy = 11.76 A. In this work we found: dy = 5.467 A, by = 4.824 A and Cy = 11.788 A. We believe that the differences in the values are due to defective growth of the a-Sb^. In order to explain the difference in the X-ray reflection intensities obtained from Sb Sn 0 and Cu Sb Sn 0 with those reported in the JCPDS card, the powder diffractograms were calculated by means of the Parthe programs [17] from the lattice parameters, the atomic positions and 268 CELL RMAMETER SIZE (A) 1180- 11.70- 8.50- S.40- 4.90- ^/y^/7///7/^/77/^77/Z/^ 4.80- a-Sb;0< a-sb^ a-Sb^ Cu-Sb-Sn-0 Sb-Sn-0 (J.CP.O.S.)

First, the a-Sbat^ pattern was calculated, its intensities reproducing those of the experimental diffractogram. Then Sb atoms were substituted by Sn atoms, but no major effects were observed on the calculated patterns, the peak intensities were similar to those obtained with pure SbaC^. However, when one of the anti- mony and some oxygen atoms were eliminated, the intensities of the reflec- tions changed noticeably. However, even in this case, the (020) peak intens- ity, which is abnormally high in the experimental pattern, did not grow. Therefore the unexpected size of the (020) peak in the experimental pat- terns is not due to an ordered substitution of Sb by Sn or to the absence of some oxygens. It must be explained in terms of preferred orientations due to the platelets noted in the electron microscopy images, (Fig. 6 d and e). The parameters used to calculate the powder diffractograms are summarized in Table 3 and the most significant calculated intensities are given in Table 4. 269 TABLE 1 Identification of phases in the mixed phases and cell parameters Catalyst Calcination temperature Crystalline phases a-Sb^ cell parameters (A) Cu Sb Sn 0 500 C No crystalline phases, thick aggregates'1 850 C a-Sb^ flo= 5.46 Cu Sbz06 bo =4.813 mixed polycrystalline Co =11.776 platelets 500 C no crystalline phases Sb Sn 0 850 C a-Sb204 ao= 5.392 polycrystalline plate- bo =4.812 lets CQ =11.768 a-Sb^ this work ao 5.467 bo =4.824 co= 11.768 J.C.P.D.S. card 11-694 ao= 5.436 bo =4.81 co= 11.76 SnOa J.C.P.D.S. card 21-1250 ao=4.738 bo =4.7 38 co= 3.188 \"TEM observations.

In Fig. 7 the radial distribution function of pure SnO; and pure a-Sb^O^ are shown. The main differences are the position and size of the peaks found at r > 4 A, however, the general features of the radial distribu- tion functions are the same. Figures 8 and 9 show, respectively, the radial distribution functions of Sb Sn 0 (500 and 850 C) and Cu Sb Sn 0 (500 and 850 C). In the zone from r = 0 to r = 6 A, the curves correspond- ing to Sb-Sn-0 (500 C), Cu-Sb-Sn-0 (500 C), Cu-Sb-Sn-0 (850 C) and SnO; (800 C) have the same shape and, therefore, a similar short range structure.

As expected, the temperature caused sintering, which reduced the catalyst surface at least by 50%, Table 6. Copper seems to inhibit the sintering, i.e. the area of the Cu Sb Sn 0 (850 C) is twice the area of the Sb-Sn-0 (850 C). Electron microscopy allows a direct evaluation of size and morphology. For instance, the Sb:^ phase is composed of aggregates of about 1 p. in diameter. In contrast, the mixed oxide plates have typical diameters of about 0.2 fi, but smaller sizes were found commonly, probably due to fractions of bigger plates. The size distributions for the small domains in each aggregate were also obtained, and oscillated around 0.02 p. in diameter. Figure 6 shows the macroscopic shape (micron range) of the pure a- Sbz04, SnOz, Sb-Sn-0 (500 and 850 C) and Cu-Sb-Sn-0 (850 C) obtained by SEM. The morphology of the a-Sb204 crystals is definitely different from the SnO; crystals. In SnOa the shape is regular and the mean size is around 1000 A, whereas in a-Sb204 the crystals are elongated and the size oscillates between 3000 and 1000 A. Surprisingly, the catalysts are not similar to pure a-Sb204 or Sn02. The Sb Sn 0 (850 C) has irregular large particles which grow in layers, and the addition of copper does not seem to alter this habit. The sample Sb Sn 0 (500 C) is seen to be amorphous and has no characteristic shape. 274 Fig. 9. Radial distribution function of Cu Sb Sn 0, 500 C ( ) and Cu Sb - Sn 0, 850 C ( ) catalysts.

Surface analysis In Table 7 the amount of Sb at the surface of Sb Sn 0 mixed oxides decreases with calcination temperature. It is possible that Sn migrates towards the surface of the large 0-8^04 crystals and the ratio Sb/Sb + Sn 276 TABLE?

The copper, then, has a stabilizing effect, assuring that tin does not migrate and the solid solution is more homogene- ous. Furthermore, copper seems to migrate with temperature inside the bulk and to reach a homogeneous distribution: the Cu/Sb + Sn + Cu ratio is equal to the value obtained by atomic absorption. The solids calcined at 500 C have a Sb/Sb + Sn ratio higher than that obtained by means of atomic absorption, therefore one can imagine a nucleus enriched in Sn while the Sb oxides grow, probably epitaxially, on it. As the temperature is increased, the Sn migrates to the surface. This observa- tion may explain the preferred orientations reported in the X-ray and elec- tron microscopy analyses. Discussion and conclusion The composition of our materials, as those of Joly et al. [11] involves an a-Sb204 matrix. We found that the morphology is the main difference between the monometallic oxides and the mixed Sb Sn 0 or Cu Sb Sn 0 solids whose structure was similar to the cervantite structure (a-SbaO^), orthorhombic. The Sn seemed to be diluted in the matrix (small changes in the lattice parameters). The (020) preferred orientation, due to the presence of polycrystalline platelets, is clear in the 850 C calcined samples. The copper seemed to inhibit the sintering with the temperature. Volta et al. [6] and Benaichouba et al. [3] have reported in previous works on Sb Sn 0 and Fe Sb Sn 0. In the first case, the matrix seems to be SnO;, and Sb is diluted into the SnO; structure as a solid solution. Antimony also comprises small oxide particles whose Sb Sb arrangements are like those at the (001) face of a-Sb204. In the second reference the Sb Sn 0 catalysts were compared to Fe Sb Sn 0. It is concluded that the catalytic properties could be related to the Sb^/Sb\"*\"5 ratio in SnO;- based solid solution. 276 Although the structures of Volta's preparations are very different from ours, a possible model, in our case, could be Volta's model but the inverse, i.e. a solid solution of Sn in an a-Sb^O^ matrix aggregation and SnOa par- ticles due to the aggregation of Sn. Then, instead of trying to determine a structural effect (long range order) due to the copper, the occurrence of special short range configurations was sought. We succeeded in preparing two different samples whose crystallography is similar but which differ in one interatomic distance: Sb Sn 0 (850 C) has a local order different from Cu Sb Sn 0 (850 C), whose short range order is the same as that found in all the other samples, as revealed by the radial distribution function. Both catalysts Sb Sn 0 (850 C) and Cu Sb Sn 0 (850 C) were crystalline, but the typical interatomic distance (r = 2.65 A) was present only in the first one. Several interpretations can be given to such a bond. The most logical seems to be the following: the distance 2.65 A can be attributed to the dis- tance Sb(III) 0(3) = 2.619 A, as reported by Thomton [12], present in the a-Sb;04, Fig. 10.

This remark explains why the 2.65 A peak appears in the radial distribution function of the 850 C calcined sample and why it is not observed in the 500 C calcined sample. Fig. 8. The copper inhibits the formation of this bond, i.e. if the link between Sb (III) and Sb (V) does not take place through 0(3) oxygen, it has then to be through 0(1) oxygen. Our results can also be compared with the reported selectivity of MoOs [4]. In this case, it has been shown that a strong bond (metal-oxygen dis- tance = 1.73 A) and a weak bond (metal-oxygen distance = 2.25 A) are needed; they differ by 0.52 A. In our case the metal-oxygen bonds are 2.12 A and 2.56 A, the difference is again 0.53 A (note that the distance between C(3) and C(l) in propylene is 2.62 A, Fig. 11. Although such a correlation is tempting, it is not the only parameter to be considered. How- ever, in our case one must admit that the only determining factor is the pre- sence of (020) preferred orientations; indeed, it is the fundamental differ- ence between the monoxides and the mixed oxides. The role of Sn should be the orientation of the crystallization to a favourable layered structure (XPS results). The copper seems just a stabilizer which inhibits the sintering (SAXS measurements), and its function is very similar to the Fe reported for Sb Sn oxides (SnO^ matrix). References 1 R. K.

The addition of Cu to the Sb—Sn—O-based catalysts seems to inhibit the sintering of the solid, but it avoids the formation of weak metal-oxygen bonds, i.e. Sb(III)—O. The fundamental difference between monometallic oxides and mixed phases is the preferred development of (020) and (001) type faces, which could be relevant for the partial oxidation selectivity properties of the catalysts.
