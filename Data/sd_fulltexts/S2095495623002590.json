Graphical abstract The outstanding electrochemical performance of CF/MnO2-I system can be attributed to the synergistic electrochemical behaviors in terms of the surface faradaic reactions and unique catalytic faradaic interaction. Improving the capacitance and energy density is a significant challenge while developing practical and flexible energy storage system (ESS). Redox mediators (RMs), as redox-active electrolyte additives, can provide additional energy storing capability via electrochemical faradaic contribution on electrodes for high-performance flexible ESSs. Particularly, determining effective material combinations between electrodes and RMs is essential for maximizing surface faradaic redox reactions for energy-storage performance. In this study, an electrode-RM system comprising heterostructured hybrid (carbon fiber (CF)/MnO2) faradaic electrodes and iodine RMs (I-RMs) in a redox-active electrolyte is investigated. The CF/MnO2 with the I-RMs (CF/MnO2-I) induces dominant catalytic faradaic interaction with the I-RMs, significantly enhancing the surface faradaic kinetics and increasing the overall energy-storage performance. The CF/MnO2-I ESSs show a 12.6-fold (or higher) increased volumetric energy density of 793.81 mWh L−1 at a current of 10 µA relative to ESSs using CF/MnO2 without I-RMs (CF/MnO2). Moreover, the CF/MnO2-I retains 93.1% of its initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, validating the excellent cyclability. Finally, the flexibility of the ESSs is tested at different bending angles (180° to 0°), demonstrating its feasibility for flexible and high-wear environments. Therefore, CF/MnO2 electrodes present a practical material combination for high-performance flexible energy-storage devices owing to the catalytic faradaic interaction with I-RMs. Keywords Energy storage system Redox mediators Faradaic electrodes Catalytic interactions Mechanical stability 1 Introduction Carbon-based flexible energy storage system (ESS) has many advantages, such as easy processing, excellent flexibility, and mechanical stability, which are not found in other electrode systems [1–8]. However, carbon-based flexible ESSs possess relatively low energy storing capability compared to other energy-storage applications (batteries and pseudocapacitors) due to the low amount of charge carriers based on the only contribution from ion adsorption/desorption behavior on the surface of electrodes. To increase the amount of active charge carriers and the overall energy storage capability, utilizing additional electrochemical faradaic contribution from non-carbon electrode materials has been widely considered. Most electrode candidates for non-carbon materials are typically investigated to develop transition-metal-based electrode [9–14]. Specifically, the electrochemical faradaic contribution and increased overall energy-storage capability primarily originate from surface faradaic reactions based on pseudo-capacitive behavior between transition-metal-based electrode materials and primary electrolyte ions such as H+ or OH− in a liquid or gel electrolyte. In recent years, it has been reported that redox mediators (RMs) as electrochemically active additives can induce additional energy storing capability for high performance flexible ESSs [15–21]. RMs can stimulate extra charge carriers by newly induced surface faradaic reactions and increase ionic conductivity in a gel electrolyte, thereby enhancing the overall energy storage performance [22–26]. However, the surface faradaic reactions induced by RMs are affected by the energy barrier of redox reactions, inducing the sluggish kinetics at the interface between electrode and RMs. Subsequently, the slow reaction rate with RMs can block the faradaic electrochemical activity of electrode materials. In addition, the number of active sites on the surface of electrode materials can be a rate-determining factor with the addition of RMs, where the slow reactions of RMs can compete with the energy storage activity of primary electrolyte ions on the active sites [27,28]. Those energy barrier and sluggish reactions of RMs can be resolved by the addition of catalytically active materials, where those materials can boost the kinetics of surface faradaic reactions with RMs (catalytic faradaic interaction). Under the catalytic faradaic interaction, RMs can be simultaneously attached and detached on the surface of electrodes, while generating the extra charge carriers and spontaneously vacating the active sites on the electrodes. Therefore, finding an effective and catalytically active electrode system is crucial to improve electrochemical reaction kinetic of surface faradaic reactions with RMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of unique electrode-RMs to improve the overall capacitance and energy density through the catalytic faradaic interaction has not been reported thus far. In this study, we have developed a new material combination consisting of heterostructured hybrid (carbon fiber (CF)/MnO2) redox electrodes and iodine RMs (I-RMs) in a gel electrolyte as the first proof-of-concept for the flexible ESSs (CF/MnO2-I). Compared with other electrode-RM candidates, the I-RMs can provide multiple surface faradaic redox reactions with the MnO2 electrode, generating several additional energy storing capability for high capacitive performance. Moreover, the redox reactions with the I-RMs follows the catalytic faradaic interaction on the surface of the electrodes; therefore, the electrochemical contribution from both the I-RMs and primary H+ ions is not restricted by the number of active sites on the surface of electrode materials. The unique material combination and the catalytic faradaic interaction of the CF/MnO2-I electrodes ensure a capacitance of 213.1 mF at a current of 10 µA. Moreover, the cycling performance well retains 93.1% of the initial value after 10,000 cycles, which is a considerable improvement compared with that of the (1) CF-only electrodes, (2) CF electrode with I-RMs (CF-I), and (3) CF/MnO2 electrodes. Even when the CF/MnO2-I samples are completely bent, twisted, and stretched, their original energy-storage performance is well maintained during the mechanical stability trial, indicating their highly flexible operation. The newly discovered catalytic faradaic interaction with I-RMs is a promising electrochemical pathway for high-performance flexible ESSs. 2 Experimental 2.1 Growth of MnO2 nanosheets on carbon fibers MnO2 nanosheets directly grown on carbon fiber (purchased from Easy Composites Ltd.) were synthesized hydrothermally. The diameter of each carbon fiber filament is approximately 7 μm. The carbon fiber yarn is composed of 3000 filaments and exhibits high electrical conductivity ranging from 1 to 5 Ω. In addition, these fibers possess excellent mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 4120 MPa and a tensile modulus of 234 GPa. Initially, a precursor solution was prepared by dissolving potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 0.79 g, 20 mM) in deionized (DI) water (250 mL). The carbon fiber was transferred into the as-prepared precursor solution, which was then maintained at 60 °C for 24 h. After the hydrothermal process, the obtained MnO2 nanosheets grown on the carbon fiber samples were washed with ethanol and DI water and dried overnight in an oven at 60°. 2.2 Fabrication of flexible hybrid faradaic ESSs To design flexible hybrid faradaic ESSs, the as-prepared MnO2 nanosheets grown on carbon fiber were used as anodic/cathodic electrodes. Initially, we prepared a faradaic redox-active electrolyte with I-RMs by mixing H3PO4 (2 mL), KI (33.4 mg) as I-RMs, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 3 g) in DI water (20 mL). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the redox-active electrolyte was coated on the as-prepared MnO2 nanosheets grown on carbon fibers and dried under ambient conditions. The two electrodes were then assembled and twisted together. Subsequently, the redox-active electrolyte was coated again on the two twisted electrodes to fabricate flexible ESSs and improve the structural integrity of the cells. To compare the electrochemical features of flexible hybrid faradaic ESSs, we prepared flexible ESSs consisting of only CF electrodes, CF electrodes with I-RMs, and CF/MnO2 electrodes without I-RMs. 2.3 Chemical/structural characterizations and electrochemical test To investigate the crystallinity of the MnO2 nanosheets on the carbon fibers, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD, Miniflex 600, Rigaku) and Raman (iXR Raman in a Nexsa XPS system) analyses. The morphology and elemental distribution of the electrodes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini SEM 300, 1.50 kV, ZEISS). The chemical bonding states of the electrodes were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Nexsa XPS System). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were carried out in a thermal analyzer (NETZSCH, STA 409 PC). The electrochemical properties of the flexible ESSs were evaluated using a potentiostat (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves were obtained at various scan rates from 10 to 200 mV s−1 and different current ranges from 10 to 500 μA, respectively, under a voltage window in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 V. To further investigate the energy-storage mechanism for flexible hybrid faradaic ESSs, the electrochemical evaluation was carried out using a three-electrode system consisting of a Pt plate as the counter electrode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M H3PO4 liquid electrolyte with and without I-RMs. 3 Results and discussion The design and manufacturing process of heterostructured hybrid (CF/MnO2) faradaic electrodes is illustrated in Fig. 1. The cleaned carbon fiber yarn was treated using a solution-based hydrothermal method to nucleate and crystallize the MnO2 nanostructures on the CF (CF/MnO2-yarn). By controlling the supersaturation states in the hydrothermal methods, thin and heterostructured nanosheets of MnO2 were deposited on the CF yarn. There is synergistic contribution from the heterostructure of CF/MnO2. The MnO2 nanosheets, with their high surface area, can enlarge the electrochemically active sites, which are favorable for both catalysis and surface interactions. Moreover, the conductive carbon nanofiber can act as the favorable electron pathway and the mechanically stable backbone, which can improve the overall performance. Also, the amount of MnO2 in the formed CF/MnO2 electrodes is determined to be 11.3 wt% using TGA (Fig. S1). Subsequently, the CF/MnO2 yarns were coated with a faradaic redox-active electrolyte with I-RMs, which served as solid-state electrolyte and separator. To fabricate an integrated full-cell ESS, two CF/MnO2 yarns (as a set of positive and negative electrodes) were twisted and assembled for the full-cell configuration. Finally, the redox-active electrolyte with I-RMs was reintroduced on the outermost layer of the ESSs as a final protective shell. Fig. 2 (a) shows the cross-sectional images of the CF/MnO2 ESSs. Two electrode yarns were coated in inner and outer layers with PVA-KOH. In addition, the heterostructured MnO2 morphology on the surface of the CF yarns is confirmed. Fig. 2(b) shows the effects of hydrothermal growth on the CF yarn. SEM images clearly indicate that the nanosheet of MnO2 is deposited on the CF yarn. Furthermore, the elemental distribution of CF-MnO2 was identified using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping analysis; C, Mn, and O atoms were observed. To evaluate the crystallographic and binding information of the CF-MnO2 electrode, XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses were performed (Fig. 2c–e). The obtained diffraction patterns are indexed to the standard diffraction patterns of MnO2 (JCPDS card no. 80-1098) [29,30]. The XRD peaks observed at 2θ = 12.3°, 36.8°, and 65.8° are assigned to the (001), (111), and (312) planes of MnO2, respectively (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2(d) depicts the Raman spectra of the CF/MnO2 electrode. Two representative carbon peaks (a slight broadening of the D-band and G-band peak at 1360.8 and 1583.2 cm−1, respectively) are observed [29,30], indicating conventional carbon composites. Moreover, two prominent peaks are located at 570.1 and 644.7 cm−1, which directly correspond to the Mn–O vibration [31,32]. Fig. 2(e) displays the XPS spectra of Mn 2p and O 1s of the CF/MnO2 electrode. The Mn 2p spectrum indicates strong Mn4+ binding energy peaks at 642.9 and 654.5 eV for Mn 2p 3/2 and Mn 2p 1/2, respectively [32]. Moreover, the O 1s spectrum of the CF/MnO2 electrode can be deconvoluted to a well-defined doublet at 530.3 and 532.5 eV. The strong peak at 530.3 eV can be assigned to the Mn–O–Mn bond, which corresponds well with that of the other MnO2 composite samples. The other broad and sub-peaks at 532.5 eV originate from the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of the CF/MnO2 electrode [33]. Fig. 2(f) presents cross-sectional SEM images of the two assembled CF/MnO2 ESSs with the outer redox-active electrolyte. The overall diameter of the ESS is approximately 1–2 mm. The EDX mapping images confirm the elemental distribution of C, Mn, K, and P (Fig. 2g); K originates from the additive agent potassium iodide (KI) of I-RMs, and P is from the base H3PO4 electrolyte. Finally, I atoms from the I-RMs were detected using XPS analysis. Fig. 2(h) demonstrates the existence of I in the redox active electrolyte, showing the distinct I 3d spectrum at 619.9 and 631.4 eV [34]. Thus, comparing the SEM, EDX, XRD, Raman, and XPS results provides direct evidence of the heterostructured hybrid (CF/MnO2) electrodes and I-RMs in the redox-active electrolyte. Fig. 3 (a) shows CV curves of the CF, CF/MnO2, CF-I, and CF/MnO2-I electrodes under an applied potential in the range of 0.0–1.0 V at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Strong redox humps at 0.4 and 0.8 V are detected for the CF/MnO2-I electrode. Moreover, the integrated CV area for the CF/MnO2-I electrode is considerably larger than that of the CF, CF/MnO2, and CF-I electrodes. This indicates that the CF/MnO2-I electrode possesses superior electrochemical capacitance. The capacitance values estimated from the CV curves are shown in Fig. 3(b). The calculated capacitance values of CF/MnO2-I, CF-I, CF/MnO2, and CF are 34.2, 8.0, 6.2, and 3.2 mF, respectively. In order to further investigate charge storing mechanism, we estimated the capacitive contribution and the faradaic contribution using CV curves of as-prepared samples. The relationship between both contributions can be expressed by the following Eq. (1). (1) i V = k 1 υ + k 2 ν 0.5 At a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 (Fig. S2), the calculated faradaic contribution of CF/MnO2-I (24.0%) is higher than that of other electrodes (21.2%, 20.0%, and 9.0% for CF-I, CF/MnO2, and CF, respectively). In addition, all the CV curves demonstrate similar shapes at different scan rates, indicating the reversible faradaic behavior of CF/MnO2-I (Fig. 3c). To investigate the energy-storage mechanism of the CF/MnO2 electrodes with and without I-RMs, the electrochemical kinetics of CF/MnO2-I was tested using a three-electrode system with an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a Pt electrode as the counter electrode. Fig. 3(d) shows the CV curves of CF and CF-I. Only the small CV curve is confirmed for CF without I-RMs (only ion adsorption/desorption behaviors of the primary H+ ions). In contrast, when the mixture of the gel electrolyte (PVA/H3PO4) and I-RMs is used, the CV curve shows the clear surface faradaic reactions with the I-RMs with the larger CV integrated area. The faradaic reaction pair at 0.55 and 0.40 V for an anodic and a cathodic peak, respectively, is attributed to the induced redox reactions between the CF electrode and I-RMs. Moreover, the CV curve of CF/MnO2 is compared with that of CF (Fig. 3e). The CF/MnO2 also shows a rectangular CV curve with the bigger area, confirming that the MnO2 electrode can interact with H+ ions (surface faradaic reaction of the primary H+ ions) according to following Eq. (2) [35,36]. (2) M n O 2 + H + + e - ⇄ M n O O H (3) 3 I - ⇄ I 3 - + 2 e - (4) 2 I - ⇄ I 2 a q + 2 e - Finally, the CV area of CF/MnO2-I is considerably larger than that of CF-I, indicating that the energy-storage performance of CF/MnO2-I is strongly increased because of the enlarged surface faradaic reactions between MnO2 and I-RMs according to following Eqs. (3) and (4) (Fig. 3f). Compared to the CF-I, the increased overall capacitance of CF/MnO2-I originates from the surface faradaic reactions of I-RMs enhanced via catalytic faradaic interaction between both MnO2 and I-RMs (Eqs. (3) and (4)) as well as surface faradaic reactions of MnO2 and H+ ions (Eq. (2)). Also, the redox peak of CF/MnO2-I slightly shifts in comparison with CF-I. As shown in Fig. S2, the faradic contribution of CF/MnO2-I is the largest (the capacitive reaction contribution is the lowest) compared to other electrodes. With respect to the interaction between MnO2 and iodine ions, the large faradaic contribution can lead to a shift in the redox peaks and polarization. To determine the existence of the catalytic faradaic interaction, as shown in Fig. S3(a), the Pt electrodes with the I-RMs demonstrate similar electrochemical behavior to CF/MnO2-I, according to the CV curve at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Pt is a prominent catalytic material that can induce catalytic faradaic interaction with the RM-Is (Eqs. (3) and (4)) [37]. Therefore, MnO2 can also act as the catalytically active sites for the I-RMs (Fig. S3b). Based on the use of both MnO2 electrodes and I-RMs, the CF/MnO2-I system can successfully utilize synergistic electrochemical contribution based on both the surface faradaic reactions (from primary H+ ions) and catalytic faradaic interaction (I-RMs) to extract the additional energy-storage carriers (Fig. 3g). Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. S4 show the GCD curves of CF/MnO2-I under various charge/discharge currents. The estimated capacitance of CF/MnO2-I, which approaches 213.1 mF at a current of 10 µA, is greater than that of other electrodes (33.0, 16.9, and 6.4 mF for CF-I, CF/MnO2, and CF electrodes, respectively, at 10 µA), as shown in Fig. 4(b). Furthermore, the calculated volumetric energy density (793.81 mWh L−1) of CF/MnO2-I is higher than that of other samples (122.91, 62.76, and 23.84 mWh L−1 for CF-I, CF/MnO2, and CF, respectively). The performance of CF/MnO2-I is also compared with other reported electrodes as summarized in Table S1. The markedly increased capacitance of CF/MnO2-I can be attributed to the synergistically engineered faradaic redox reactions of RM with catalytic behavior via MnO2 and the intrinsic surface faradaic redox reaction of RM and MnO2 (Fig. 4c). Also, even at a high current of 500 μA, the CF/MnO2-I can achieve a capacitance of up to 32 mF and Coulombic efficiency close to 100% (Fig. S5 a). However, at relatively low current range from 10 to 20 μA, the Coulombic efficiency of CF/MnO2-I is less than 90% due to the relatively sluggish kinetics from its large faradaic contribution for the overall performance. Also, to guarantee the reproducibility for production on a large scale, we have evaluated the reproducibility test using eight different CF/MnO2-I electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the CV curves of each CF/MnO2-I sample exhibit a similar shape and normalized capacitance, indicating the high industrial feasibility of CF/MnO2-I. For investigating the self-discharge behavior of CF/MnO2-I, we have estimated the decline of open circuit voltage after the fully charged state of CF/MnO2-I. After 20,000 s, the open circuit voltage of CH/MnO2-I showed 0.7 V, which is higher than that of other previously reported literatures (Fig. S5b). Additionally, electrochemical cycling tests were performed to evaluate the long-term operational stability of CF-MnO2-I. The specific capacitance of CF/MnO2-I was well maintained at 93.1% of the initial value even after 10,000 cycles, thus representing the excellent electrochemical stability of the devices (Fig. 4e). Finally, the time-dependent performance degradation of CF/MnO2-I was tested for 90 days (Fig. 4f). The capacitance of CF/MnO2-I was calculated after exposing the electrodes to ambient air for 90 days. The performance degradation is negligible, and 96.3% of the initial capacitance is estimated, demonstrating that the CF/MnO2-I electrode guarantees a high electrochemical stability against the external environment. In addition, the circuit feasibility of the CF/MnO2-I was tested (Fig. 5). Owing to their wire-based configuration, the CF/MnO2-I ESSs can be systematically connected in a series, parallel, or combined circuit (S-, P-, and CC-ESSs) (Fig. 5a–c). The CV curves of the S-, P-, and CC-ESSs at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 5(d–f). The potential window (0.0–3.0 V) of the S-ESSs is three times greater than that of the single ESSs. Moreover, the P-ESSs have a three-fold current value during the charge/discharge cycles along a potential window of 0.0–1.0 V. The three combined ESSs connected in both parallel and series can synergistically increase the energy-storage performance. The CC-ESSs can simultaneously provide a wider potential window and larger charge-storage current than single ESS, owing to their circuit connection. As shown in Fig. 5(g–i), the CF/MnO2-I ESSs can maintain the original energy-storage performance despite being folded from 180° to 0°. This demonstrates the high mechanical flexibility of CF/MnO2-I ESSs. The CV curves of the folded CF/MnO2-I ESSs demonstrate negligible performance degradation from 180° to 0° (Fig. 5h). During the charge/discharge cycles, the CF/MnO2-I ESSs were continuously folded to 90°. Despite the folding operation, the CF/MnO2-I ESSs maintain their original charge storage performance (Fig. 5i). These results confirm that the CF/MnO2-I ESS is practically applicable for flexible energy storage. 4 Conclusions In this study, we have developed a new material combination consisting of heterostructured hybrid (CF/MnO2) redox electrodes and I-RMs in a gel electrolyte as the first proof-of-concept for a flexible ESS (CF/MnO2-I). Compared with other electrode-RM candidates, the I-RMs can provide multiple surface faradaic redox reactions with the MnO2 electrode, generating several additional energy storing capability for high capacitive performance. Moreover, the redox reactions with the I-RMs follow the catalytic faradaic interaction on the surface of the electrodes; therefore, the electrochemical contribution from both the I-RMs and primary H+ ions are not restricted by the number of active sites on the electrode materials. The unique material combination and the catalytic faradaic interaction of the CF/MnO2-I electrodes ensure a capacitance of 213.1 mF at a current of 10 µA. Moreover, the cycling performance well retains 93.1% of the initial value after 10,000 cycles, which is a considerable improvement compared with that of CF-only electrodes, CF electrode with I-RMs (CF-I), and CF/MnO2 electrodes. Even when the CF/MnO2-I samples are completely bent, twisted, and stretched, their original energy-storage performance is well maintained during the mechanical stability trial, indicating their highly flexible operation. The newly discovered catalytic faradaic interaction with I-RMs is a promising electrochemical pathway for high-performance flexible ESSs. In this study, we demonstrate that the use of both heterostructured MnO2 shells and I-RMs can significantly increase the overall energy-storage performance of flexible hybrid EESs. The CF/MnO2 electrodes with I-RMs can synergistically induce both the surface faradaic reactions and unique catalytic faradaic interaction, which can generate additional charge carriers for energy storage. At a current of 10 µA, the CF/MnO2-I ESSs are confirmed to attain a capacitance of 213.1 mF and volumetric energy density of 793.81 mWh L−1, which is 6.5 times and 12.6 times higher than that of CF-I and CF/MnO2, respectively. Moreover, CF/MnO2-I exhibits strong cycling and mechanical stability as well as high circuit feasibility. These results indicate that CF/MnO2 electrodes with I-RMs can be practical ESS composites for future high-performance flexible energy-storage devices owing to their highly efficient catalytic faradaic interaction.

        "dc:description": "Improving the capacitance and energy density is a significant challenge while developing practical and flexible energy storage system (ESS). Redox mediators (RMs), as redox-active electrolyte additives, can provide additional energy storing capability via electrochemical faradaic contribution on electrodes for high-performance flexible ESSs. Particularly, determining effective material combinations between electrodes and RMs is essential for maximizing surface faradaic redox reactions for energy-storage performance. In this study, an electrode-RM system comprising heterostructured hybrid (carbon fiber (CF)/MnO2) faradaic electrodes and iodine RMs (I-RMs) in a redox-active electrolyte is investigated. The CF/MnO2 with the I-RMs (CF/MnO2-I) induces dominant catalytic faradaic interaction with the I-RMs, significantly enhancing the surface faradaic kinetics and increasing the overall energy-storage performance. The CF/MnO2-I ESSs show a 12.6-fold (or higher) increased volumetric energy density of 793.81 mWh L−1 at a current of 10 µA relative to ESSs using CF/MnO2 without I-RMs (CF/MnO2). Moreover, the CF/MnO2-I retains 93.1% of its initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, validating the excellent cyclability. Finally, the flexibility of the ESSs is tested at different bending angles (180° to 0°), demonstrating its feasibility for flexible and high-wear environments. Therefore, CF/MnO2 electrodes present a practical material combination for high-performance flexible energy-storage devices owing to the catalytic faradaic interaction with I-RMs.",
