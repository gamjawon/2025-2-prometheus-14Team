PALMA* Dipartimento di Chimica Fisica, via Loredan 1, 1-35131, Padua (Italy) Summary Crosslinked copolymers of cyanoethyl acrylate appear to be good lig- ands towards Td2\"1\", in nitromethane. Thus, reaction of [Pd(NC M^]2'1' with macromolecular nitriles allows the transfer of the metal centre from an 'ordinary' coordination sphere to an unconventional one, i.e. nitrile groups pendant from polymeric backbones. The macromolecular complexes obtained appear to maintain the catalytic ability of [Pd(NC Me)4]2'1\" in the dimeriza- tion of methyl acrylate in nitromethane. However, the sensitivity of the hybrid catalyst to traces of water turns out to be a limiting factor in its activity and re-usability. Introduction Tetrakis(acetonitrile)palladium(II), ^(NC A^]24^ (1), is a metal complex possessing remarkably wide-ranging reactivity [1]. Complex (1) is also known to be catalytically active in the homogeneous phase in the oligomerization of olefins [2], in the polymerization of 1-olefins and alkynes [2a, 2b, 3], in the polymerization of phenylcyclopropane [2b], in the telomer- ization of COg and butadiene [4], and in the double-bond migration of olefins [5]. *Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 210 In the context of our developing programme on the synthesis of novel potential hybrid catalysts based on a wide range of solvent-compatible insoluble polymeric supports [6], we have developed an interest in preparing a polymer-supported counterpart of (1). In order to evaluate the catalytic potential of these new materials, we have chosen the dimerization of 1-olefins as a model reaction. The dimerization and oligomerization of olefins is a technologically important metal-catalyzed process in the homogeneous phase (DIMERSOL, ALPHABUTOL and SHOP processes [7]). In the DIMERSOL and SHOP catalytic systems, the experimental conditions are relatively mild and cata- lyst activity may be considered quite acceptable. However, the search for more practical heterogeneous processes has stimulated considerable research effort in recent years [8]. Particularly remarkable have been the attempts to heterogenize the SHOP process [9], but the results have turned out to be technologically unsatisfactory because of various physicochemical draw- backs [9]. In addition, Rh1 [10] and Pd\" [11] supported on inorganic materials have been considered as potentially interesting catalytic centres for hybrid dimer- ization catalysts, but to our knowledge these investigations have produced no practical applications. The model reaction chosen for evaluating the catalytic potency of our macromolecular complexes was the dimerization of methyl acrylate to dimethyl 2,3-dehydroadipate [12,13], which appears to be a clean and conve- nient test reaction (T = 40 C; yield, ca. 95%; chemoselectivity, ca. 95%). Under homogeneous conditions, the activity of (1) is only moderate, but the specificity and selectivity appear quite satisfactory. Experimental Materials Methyl acrylate (MA), acrylonitrile (AN), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) and triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) were obtained from Aldrich; cyanoethyl acrylate (CEA) was from Alfa and methyl tri- ethyleneglycol methacrylate (M3G) was from Rohm. They were all of reagent grade. Nitromethane was from Prolabo. All other reagents and solvents were from various commercial sources and of reagent grade. [Pd(NC Me)4](BF,()2 was prepared according to ref. l(a). All solvents utilized were dried by molecular sieves (4 A), previously activated at 200 C under vacuum for 8 h.

Details on the individual polymerization experiments are reported in Table 1. The general procedure employed was as follows. A mixture of the desired monomers, crosslinker and water was injected dropwise (ca. 1 cni^min\"1) by means of a syringe (needle internal diameter, ca. 0.45 mm) into an excess amount of petroleum ether cooled to 78 C. Glassy particles were obtained in this way in which water separated as small ice crystals distributed homogeneously in the glassy monomer phase. The bead-like particles immersed in petroleum ether were irradiated with \"Co y-rays at 0.50 Gy s-1 (0.05 for polymer N2) and at -78 C for 15 h. The resulting polymers were all swellable in nitromethane (observed volume increase ranged from 100% to 200%); N and N2 were obtained in the form of spherical particles of 1 - 2 mm diameter, while NN was in irregular lumps. The resulting materials were washed with water, ethanol, acetone and ethyl ether in that order and finally dried under vacuum for 24 h. For SEM examination, the water-swollen beads were frozen in liquid nitrogen, crushed and dried via lyophilization. The polymers thus obtained were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and SEM (see Table 2). Catalyst synthesis All syntheses were undertaken under an inert atmosphere. The 'incorpo- ration' of (1) into the polymers N, NN and N2 was achieved by adding saturated solutions of (1) in nitromethane to the proper amount of polymeric ligand (see Table 3), which had been completely swollen with the smallest amount of nitromethane. The suspension thus obtained was shaken vigor- ously immediately and mechanical shaking was continued for 2 h.

''Estimated from the expected CEA incorporation (vide infra) After filtration, the material was washed three times with excess ni- tromethane. Solutions resulting from this procedure were evaporated to dryness for metal determination. The materials were characterized by elemental analysis, metal mass balances and IR spectra (Table 4). The metal distribution in N2-(l) was estimated by X-ray microprobe analysis. Metal analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry, after mineralization of 10 mg of material with 5 cm3 of a HgSC^/HNOs mixture (1/1, v/v) at reflux temperature for 2 h, followed by dilution with deionized water. Catalytic tests The conditions for hybrid catalysis were chosen as comparable with those involving the use of (1) when dissolved in nitromethane. Thus, a reference test was carried out with (1) as the catalyst under the following conditions: [MA] = 1.1 mol dm-3 in (^NOg; [Pd\"] = 59.4 x 10-3 mol dm-3; temperature = 40 C; time = 30 h; volume = 5 cm3; conversion = 100%; yield in dimethyl 2,3-dehydroadipate = 99%; TN = 19 (mol/mol). The nature of the product was checked by GLC-MS tests.

The observed catalytic activity refers to a reaction time, which was chosen on the basis of practical experience. Chromatographic conditions: capillary column; stationary phase = poly(phenylcyanopropyl)silane; injector temperature = 280 C; programmed temperature ramp from 60 C to 170 C (32 C min\"1 from time = 2.50 min). The conditions employed for the hybrid catalytic runs were the same as above except that [Pd\"] was ca. 6 x 10~3 mol dm~3. The analytical concentration of Pd11 was chosen as 1/lOth of that of the reference catalyst test in the homogeneous phase. In fact, under the experi- mental conditions employed, the volume of the swollen catalytic material was ca. 10% of the total volume of the reacting suspension; the real Pd11 concen- tration inside the catalytic beads was therefore comparable to that of the homogeneous phase in the reference test. In some tests, p-benzoquinone was used as a non-ligating re-oxidizing [12,14] agent for metallic palladium [14], which is invariably observed as the consequence of the presence of traces of water in the reaction medium. The deposition of metallic palladium was also observed under homogeneous phase conditions. During the catalytic runs, the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred throughout. Results and discussion Synthetic strategy of supports and metal-polymer complexes The basic tenet of this work was the preparation of a form of [Pd(NC Me)4]2+ in which (a) the metal centre maintains its peculiar elec- trophilic character, (b) the metal centre is accessible to reagents in a fashion similar to that of dissolved [Pd(NC Me)4]2+ and (c) the metal centre is actually fixed in a solid, albeit flexible, solvent-compatible matrix. To this end, most promising supports appeared to be flexible and swellable polymer matrices obtained by copolymerization of cyanoethyl aery- late with other acrylic monomers (Fig. 1). If these matrices contain appropriate concentrations of CN groups, all equally available and homogeneously distributed, the synthesis of complexes such as [Pd(NC (B^l24^ should be possible. These species would represent the supported counterparts of [Pd(NC Me)4]2+ (Fig. 2). Synthesis of N, NN, N2 polymers and of their Pd11 complexes Polymer N is obtained in high yield with a chemical composition fairly close to that calculated from the initial monomer ratio. It appears as mechanically strong white beads, which are swellable in nitromethane (ca. 200%). SEM micrographs reveal a regular porosity with ca. 1 ^m average 216 Polymer N Polymer NN <., Polymer N2 /u Fig. 1. Sketch of the structures of polymers N, NN and N2. pore diameter. The CN group produces a medium to weak intensity symmet- ric IR band at 2254 cm\"1. Polymer N2 is prepared in moderate yields as white rubber-like beads with fair mechanical properties. It is moderately swellable in nitromethane and has an average pore diameter of ca. 5 fim (Fig. 3). The CN group is characterized by a medium intensity IR band at 2254 cm\"1. Polymer NN is obtained in very low yield and proved to be readily friable as well as irregularly porous (average pore diameter equal to 0.3 /im). Fig. 2. Sketch of the molecular structure of ^(^ (l'^]2\"1-. 216 Fig. 3. SEM micrograph of polymer N2 (external face, x 1500). It is moderately swellable in nitromethane. Also its IR spectrum reveals the presence of the v(CN) band of AN (2243 cm-1) and the v(CN) band of CEA (shoulder at ca. 2255 cm\"1). It is worth noting that the experimental percentage of nitrogen found in NN and N2 allows the charges in their CN ligating groups to be deter- mined. The prepared macromolecular nitriles proved to be good ligands to- wards 'Pd2^ in nitromethane (Table 4). The expected prevailing ligating groups in polymer N are the CN, but formamido functions might also be reactive towards the highly electrophilic centre employed [Id]. Polymer N2 was designed simply because it possessed only pending CN groups as potentially coordinating residues, since, to our knowledge, ester and ethereal groups do not exhibit coordinating ability to 'Pd2+'. In polymer NN, the CN groups associated with both AN and CEA monomeric units should be able to coordinate Pd\", but the actual basicity of the AN nitrile group may be lower because of its proximity to the polymer backbone. In all cases, the macromolecular nitriles appear to react with (1) in nitromethane according to the general equation: 4(B CN+[Pd(NC Me)4]2+ . ^(NC CP^J^^^MeCN (1) In fact, the IR spectra display single and symmetric bands in the range 2330-2300cm-1 attributable to Pd^coordinated nitrile ligands [15] [v(CN) = 2350 cm-1 for (1)], and this observation suggests the formation of tetrakis Pd11 species such as [Pd(NC (I^]^ co-existing with uncoordi- nated pendant CN groups. 217 In the case of polymer NN, the PcF-polymer adduct displays a 2315 cm\"1 v(CN) band evidently corresponding to the 2327 and 2303 ones observed in the other complexes, and a 2243 cm\"1 peak which can be ascribed to the wwvCHg CH(CN)^W^A monomeric entity (expected range = 2260 - 2240 cm\"1). This band appears as the major absorption in the spectrum of the reacting polymer while the previous shoulder at ca. 2255 cm\"!, clearly to be attributed to the A^ACHg CI^COOCHzCHzCN)/'^/^ entity, is absent in the spectrum of the NN-(l) adduct. The concomitant development of the 2315cm-1 band leaves little doubt that: (i) the species ^(NC d^]2-^ is formed by using the CN ligands pertaining to CEA; and (ii) the CN groups corresponding to AN are not available for coordination in practice. As a general comment to these findings, it should be remarked that the proposed coordination of four CN groups per palladium ion strongly indicates that the polymeric chains in N, NN and N2 are particularly flexible and that the nitrile charge is sufficiently large, as well as homogeneously distributed, to allow tetracoordination to be achieved. The data of entry 3 are a little ambiguous. On the basis of the initial CN/Pd\" ratio, the amount of incorporated Pd determined would imply the total involvement of the available CN groups if only [Pd(NC ^]2+ species are to be formed. This means that no residual free CN groups should be detectable in the IR spectrum of the macromolecular complex, and this is in contrast to the presence of an appreciable band at 2250 cm~1. It is possible that such a contradiction is the consequence of limitations in the analytical accuracy of the elemental analysis. Finally, with regard to the metal distribution inside the polymer beads, X-ray microprobe analysis reveals that this is quite homogeneous throughout the polymer matrix (Fig. 4). Catalytic tests The test reaction is depicted by eqn. (2): 0 cat. 0 o ^\\ -^ \\^\\\\^y\\ 0 CH3NOa 0 0 (2) The experimental conditions (i.e. concentration, temperature, reaction time, etc.) were chosen in order to be comparable with those used in the homogeneous phase catalytic test (see experimental section). The data are collected in Table 5. Two out of three catalysts appear to be active and fairly chemoselective towards the synthesis of dimethyl 2,3-dehydroadipate. Albeit low, the catalytic activity appears to be preserved into macro- molecular [^(NO-I^]^ complexes, with TNs ranging from 7 to 42. The use ofp-benzoquinone as a non-ligating re-oxidant [12] appears to improve the catalytic activity, but its effect was not optimized. In fact, the v(CN) band of the polymer to 'Pd2+' bond is no longer detectable after the 218 Fig. 4. X-Ray microprobe scanning picture. Metal distribution in the section of a bead of the macromolecular complex N2-(l). Brighter spots reveal the palladium distribution (x 50). catalytic run in the absence ofp-benzoquinone. In contrast, the absorption is still present, albeit reduced in intensity, if the re-oxidant is employed. These data suggest that the reduction of Pd\" to Pd , due to traces of water in the reaction medium, is a severe limiting factor for the catalytic activity of the [Pd(NC )4]2\"1' catalysts. Therefore, proper experimental conditions could substantially improve their catalytic potency and make the catalytic material quite re-usable in consecutive synthetic runs.

The catalytic properties of 'Pd2+' appear to be preserved for the dimer- ization of 1-olefins, but the protection of the metal centre from reduction to the metal seems to be a major problem, as is the case for the use of (1) in the homogeneous phase. In spite of this drawback, the exploitation of the wide reactivity and catalytic activity of macromolecular [Pd(NC I^]2'1' complexes appears to be possible. References 1 (a) R. F. Schranun and B. B.

Palma 1 Dipartimento di Chimica Fisica, via Loredan 2, 1-35131, PaduaItaly Crosslinked copolymers of cyanoethyl acrylate appear to be good ligands towards ‘Pd2+, in nitromethane. Thus, reaction of [Pd(NC-Me)4]2+ with macromolecular nitriles allows the transfer of the metal centre from an ‘ordinary’ coordination sphere to an unconventional one, i.e. nitrile groups pendant from polymeric backbones. The macromolecular complexes obtained appear to maintain the catalytic ability of [Pd(NC-Me)4]2+ in the dimerization of methyl acrylate in nitromethane. However, the sensitivity of the hybrid catalyst to traces of water turns out to be a limiting factor in its activity and re-usability. References 1 (a) R.F. Schramm B.B. Wayland Chem.
