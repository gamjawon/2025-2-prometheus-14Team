There is great potential for carbon-supported gold catalysts to replace toxic mercuric chloride-based catalysts in the acetylene hydrochlorination, which is a key process for producing PVC. However, the catalyst design is essentially hindered by the difficulties in enhancing the catalytic activity of cationic gold and suppressing the deactivation of active species. We report a strategy for self-oxidation of Au3+ by the Au-SILP system with the [Bmim][Cl3] ILs. This strategy can stabilize all gold species in the state of highly oxidized Au3+ instead of coexisting in the Au3+/Au+ site, which makes the catalyst exhibit excellent catalytic activity. High coordination numbers Au-Cl entities reduce the electron transfer between Au3+ and C2H2 and weaken the adsorption of C2H2 on the Au active sites. Furthermore, [Bmim][Cl3] ILs can self-oxidize gold nanoparticles on the support surface into Au3+. This study provides a new method for improving the stability and activity of gold-based acetylene hydrochlorination catalysts.

It is a monomer for the synthesis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [1–3], which is currently the third best-selling polymer in the world. However, mercury-based catalysts must be used in the existing industrial production process of acetylene hydrochlorination to produce VCM [4,5], leading to the volatilization of toxic mercury components and the threat to human health. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop non-mercury catalyst replacements and realize large-scale industrial applications. Since Hutchings' pioneering revelation of the excellent catalytic activity of gold catalysts in acetylene hydrochlorination, extensive research interests have been aroused and the main active sites of cationic gold are widely accepted. Furthermore, the discovery of single-atom catalyst makes up for the disadvantage of the high cost gold-based catalysts. Unfortunately, gold-based catalyst is unstable in the form of single cations in acetylene hydrochlorination, which limits large-scale industrial production [6–12]. The main reason for the deactivation of Au-based catalysts in the atmosphere of the strong reducing agent acetylene is considered to be the over-reduction of active cationic gold to inactive Au0, which may attribute to thermodynamically favorable auto-reduction. Based on the deactivation mechanism of Au-based catalysts, a wide variety of supports and ligands have been investigated to improve catalyst stability [13–20]. Lin chose CeO2 with the ability of in situ self-regenerating cationic gold as an auxiliary agent to achieve enhanced activity and ultra-stability for acetylene hydrochlorination [12]. Zhao introduced [Bmim][N(CN)2] ILs into the Au-SILP system to stabilize the gold active center with Au-N coordination [21]. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) not only constructs an HCl-rich microenvironment to prevent the reduction of excess C2H2, but also has the effect of stabilizing cationic gold [7,21]. However, during the long-term reaction process, the formation of gold nanoparticles and the deactivation of the catalyst still exist [22,23]. Therefore, finding a more effective solution to the current problems of Au-based supported ionic liquid phase (Au-SILP) catalysts is a challenge for researches [24–30]. In this work, we studied the activity and stability of Au-SILP catalysts and compared them with Au/AC catalysts [7,13,21,31]. It is verified that the reason for the deactivation of Au-SILP catalysts is the agglomeration of cationic gold. While the [Bmim][Cl3] ILs modified Au-IL/AC catalysts [32] exhibited excellent activity and lifetime in acetylene hydrochlorination. At GHSV (C2H2) = 1000 h-1, the conversion rate of C2H2 reached 51.2% and showed no slight downward trend after the reaction. The structure-property relationship between ILs and gold active sites is rationally explained by spectroscopic characterizations and mechanistic studies using DFT simulations. The introduction of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs into the Au-SILP system balances the stability of cationic gold with high Au-Cl coordination numbers (CNs) and the catalytic activity of high-valence cationic gold. At the same time, the strong oxidation ability of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs makes Au-Cl3/AC catalyst have the property of self-oxidation. This method also provides some assistance in the design of stable high-valent gold catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Chemicals Activated carbon was used as the support of the catalyst, which was purchased from NORIT. Chlorine (Cl2, 99%), Acetylene (C2H2, 98%), and Hydrogen chloride (HCl, 99.999%) were supplied by Hangzhou Minxing Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. All chemicals were employed as received without further treatment. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquids ([Bmim][Cl], 99%) was procured from Lanzhou Greenchem ILS, LICP. CAS. HAuCl4·4 H2O (the content of Au assay ≥49%), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99%), and potassium iodide (KI, 99%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ulupure system (18.25 MΩ cm-1) provided deionized water. 2.2 Synthesis of trichloride ionic liquids [Bmim][Cl3] ILs were synthesized using the method reported previously by K. Binnemans [32]. Structures of two ILs, [Bmim][Cl] and [Bmim][Cl3], are shown in Fig. S1, and the scheme of the setup for synthesis of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs is shown in Fig. S2, which shows the device consists of two gas cylinders (N2 and Cl2), one reaction bottle and four washing bottles. Since [Bmim][Cl] ILs has strong water absorption properties, it will affect the formation of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs. All glassware used in the reaction process were dried in an oven at 110 ℃ to remove water. [Bmim][Cl] ILs (5–25 g) needs to be dried in a vacuum oven before the reaction starts at 50 °C for 24 h. Before the reaction starts, it is necessary to check the connected reaction device for leaks. Then, pass nitrogen gas flows at a rate of 20 g h-1 and 2 bar for 30 min. Cl2 was blown into the flask at a minimum flow rate of 2 bar (2.1 g h-1) to maximize the contact time of the chlorine gas with the [Bmim][Cl] ILs. Fig. S3 shows the synthesis of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs, which is synthesized by passing chlorine into [Bmim][Cl] ILs, resulting in the disappearance of crystal particles and the formation of yellow liquid. First, blow N2 into the system again to remove the remaining Cl2 in the system at a rate of 2.1 g h-1 for 30 min. Then, maintain 20 g h-1 N2 for 10 min. The excess Cl2 in the reaction is absorbed by 10 wt% NaOH solution. Finally, add 10 wt% KI solution into the third washing bottle as an indicator to judge whether there is remaining Cl2. 2.3 SILP catalyst preparation Supported Au-IL catalysts were prepared by impregnation method as described in our previous work [21,33,34]. HAuCl4·4 H2O is used as the precursor of gold and ILs are dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Afterwards pour the solution into the pre-treated AC support and keep stirring. The homogeneously mixed impregnating solution was dried overnight in the air at 110 ℃ to obtain the catalysts. The nomenclature of the catalyst satisfies the following rules: called Au-X/AC, where X on behalf of the ILs used. The corresponding Au/AC catalysts were prepared by a similar method for the comparison. In this work, the loadings of ILs and Au were unified as 10% and 0.1%, respectively. 2.4 Characterization Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) specific surface areas were detected using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at liquid N2 temperature in a BJ builder Kubo X1000 for the samples outgassed at 77 K. Raman spectroscopy was acquired on a WITec CRM 200 confocal Raman microscope. Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDX) was carried out on a Tecnai G2 F30 S transmission electron microscope operating at 300 keV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was obtained on D/max-2400 diffractometer (Japan Rigaku Rotaflex) with Cu Kα radiation to obtain the crystal structure. The elemental composition and state of Au sites were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer). TEM images were detected with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN; FEI Company, Fremont, U.S.A.). The high-resolution HAADF-STEM characterization was measured using a probe aberration-corrected microscope (Titan Cubed Themis G2 300). Orbital occupancy and charge states of Au atoms in catalysts analyzed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) characterization. Using the Demeter software package to analyze the extended X-ray absorption fine structureEXAFS spectral data. The EXAFS spectrogram was extracted by Fourier transform (FT) to analyze the coordination structure of the cationic gold, such as the number of coordination atoms and the distance between Au atoms and adjacent atoms. 2.5 Catalytic measurements Fig. S4 shows the activity and lifetime of as-prepared Au-based catalysts evaluated in the typical fixed-bed reactor. The setup for catalyst evaluation is the same as the previous work [21]. Both C2H2 and HCl flows are regulated by mass flow controllers (Horiba-SN48). The catalyst is packed in a glass tube with a diameter of 10 mm. A blank sample evaluated in an unoccupied reactor filled with quartz sand before the start of the reaction showed no catalytic activity. The catalyst is then packed in a quartz tube, and the two ends of the catalyst are separated by quartz wool. The system was purged with N2 for at least 30 min at 120 ℃ to remove H2O and gas impurities. The mixed gas of C2H2 and HCl (V(C2H2): V(HCl) = 1:1.2) is controlled by a mass flow meter at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, C2H2) of 1000 h-1. The evaluation temperature is at 180 ℃, which is controlled by a thermocouple placed in a fixed bed reaction system, using an AI-708 P temperature controller (Xiamen Yudian Automation Technology Co., Ltd.). The reaction product obtained by the reaction is first washed with NaOH to remove excess HCl and measured by gas chromatography using a Porapak N packed colum (6 ft × 1/800 stainless steel) with adjacent a flame ionization detector (FID). Using automation software to set the sampling period at least twice per hour. The main product of the reaction is C2H3Cl, while there are also some dichloroethane by-products. Quantitative analysis of reaction product of acetylene hydrochlorination by peak area normalization method. Excess hydrogen chloride is introduced during the reaction. The yield of the reaction is calculated based on the carbon balance value of these products being close to 100%. This work calculates the conversion of acetylene and the selectivity of C2H3Cl with formula (1)-(2) as follows: (1) VCM Selectivity ( % ) = F VCM 1 - F A × 100 % (2) Acetylene conversion ( % ) = ( 1 F A F A0 ) × 100 % Where FVCM, FA0, and FA are the volume fraction of C2H3Cl in the product mixture gas, the volume fraction of C2H2 in the raw gas, and the volume fraction of remaining C2H2, respectively. 2.6 Computational details All calculations in this paper were optimized using gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) with the hybrid B3LYP exchange-correlation functional, which was carried out with the Caussian 09 package [10,35]. The lanl2dz basis set was employed in geometry optimization for the reactants, products, intermediates, and transition states. Frequency analyses were carried out to confirm that each structure is a local minimum (no imaginary frequency) or a transition state (only one imaginary frequency). Intrinsic Reaction Coordinates (IRC) calculated some key transition states to determine their connectivity to the correct intermediates. Furthermore, to make the experimental results more accurate, the def2tzvp basis set was employed in single-point energy calculations. Using Eads=Ead-state-(Ecatalyst+Ereactants) as the formula for calculating the adsorption energy, where Eads represents the adsorption energy, Ead-state represents the total energy of adsorption structure, Ecatalyst represents the total energy of catalyst, and Ereactants represents the total energy of the reactant adsorbed. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Deactivation mechanism of Au-SILP catalysts Using HAuCl4·4 H2O as the precursor, Au/AC and Au-Cl/AC catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. The effect of loading gold species and ILs on the surface pore structure of AC support was studied by BET. Fig. S5 shows AC conforms to the characteristics of type Ⅰ adsorption isotherm (the adsorption capacity presents a plateau and no hysteresis loop). Tab. S1 shows that the surface area and pore volume of AC support is 1308 m2 g-1 and 0.66 cm-3 g-1, while Au/AC is 1261 m2 g-1 and 0.63 cm-3 g-1, and Au-Cl/AC is 1131 m2 g-1 and 0.56 cm-3 g-1. The surface area and pore volume of Au-Cl/AC are significantly decreased due to the filling of the pore by the ILs. Similar results were also found in previous studies on Au-SILP catalysts [21]. The dispersion of gold species on the AC support is measured by XRD. Fig. S6 shows the amorphous diffraction peaks of the carbon support at 25° and 43°, which correspond to the plane of (002) and (101). It is clear that the gold species on the AC support is in an amorphous form, and the gold particle size is less than 3 nm and lower than the detection limit of the XRD instrument [30,36]. However, in Fig. S7, the amorphous diffraction peaks of the fresh Au/AC catalyst at 38° correspond to the plane of Au (111), which indicates that gold nanoparticles formed and the SILP system is conducive to the uniform dispersion of Au species. The dispersion and the morphology of the catalyst surface were characterized in Fig. S8. It indicates that the Au species uniformly dispersed and no obvious nanoparticles were observed. Furthermore, elemental mapping of Au-Cl/AC catalyst confirms that gold species are uniformly dispersed and the ILs are also uniformly confined in the pores of the support. Fig. 1a shows the HAADF-STEM image of Au/AC catalyst, which revealed the presence of a proportion of nanoparticles. With the addition of [Bmim][Cl] ILs (Fig. 1b), it is difficult to detect gold nanoparticles. This phenomenon indicates that the addition of ILs promotes the dispersion of the Au species. Combined with the results of the evaluation of the catalyst for acetylene hydrochlorination below. The atomically dispersed cationic gold supported on the AC support is proved to be the active sites of acetylene hydrochlorination [13,21]. Further, the valence states of cationic gold in Au/AC and Au-Cl/AC catalysts were measured. There is more than one cationic gold with different valence states ( Fig. 2c-d), such as the Au3+ (86.7–86.9 eV), Au+ (85.1–85.5 eV), and metallic Au0 (84.0–84.2 eV). Comparing the XPS data for Au/AC and Au-Cl/AC catalysts, it is found that the peak of Au0 (84.0–84.2 eV) is significantly reduced, which shows that ILs can inhibit the reduction of Au3+ and play a role in stabilizing the active center. Gold nanoparticles exist in the Au-based catalysts probably due to the reduction of Au3+/Au+ by the AC or photoreaction during XPS detection to reduce Au3+/Au+. Catalyst lifetime and activity evaluation by acetylene hydrochlorination are performed in a fixed-bed reactor (Fig. S4). When optimizing the reaction temperature of the catalyst, it was found that the catalysts exhibited the best activity at 180 ℃. Similar results have also been reported in the literatures [7,21]. Therefore, the reaction conditions selected for the evaluation of the catalysts are at GHSV (C2H2) = 1000 h 1 and 180 ℃. Fig. 1e shows that Au-Cl/AC catalyst has higher catalytic activity in acetylene hydrochlorination. Also, the C2H2 conversion of the Au/AC catalyst plummeted after the reaction is only 15% after 20 h, while the Au-Cl/AC catalyst is still 32% of the C2H2 conversion, which indicates that [Bmim][Cl] ILs improve the activity and stability of cationic gold. To investigate the deactivation mechanism of the Au-SILP catalysts, the used catalysts were characterized by XRD. Fig. S6 shows gold nanoparticle peak was undetectable; while, Fig. S7 shows that the gold (111) plane has a higher front and more crystal planes of gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, Fig. 1f-g show the phenomenon of further agglomeration of Au nanoparticles, the characteristic crystal planes (100) and (111) of gold can be detected, and the lattice spacing of gold (111) is d = 0.235 Å. In contrast, there are no obvious gold nanoparticles in the Au-Cl/AC catalyst in Fig. 1h. However, some small nanoparticles can still be found in Fig. 1i. This indicates that deactivation of the Au-SILP catalysts is caused by agglomeration, which may due to the strong reduction of C2H2 and the reduction of Au3+/Au+ to Au0 during the reaction process. [Bmim][Cl] ILs can stabilize the active sites and improve the lifetime of the catalyst, but it still cannot meet the requirements of long-term operation in the industrial production. 3.2 Characterization and performance of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst Hutchings has reported that Cl2 with strong oxidizing properties can regenerate the deactivated Au/C catalyst in short time, which is different from the mechanism of HCl reactivation catalysts, and those with strong oxidizing properties can convert Au0 into Au3+/Au+ [37]. This provides suggestions for the development of new Au-SILP catalysts. However, in the process of industrial production of VCM, switching the reaction gas to Cl2 to regenerate Au active sites will increase production costs and affect production efficiency. To meet the harsh requirements of industrial production on catalysts without increasing production costs of VCM, the [Bmim][Cl] ILs were synthesized by modifying [Bmim][Cl] ILs, which were synthesized using the method reported previously [32]. Fig. S3 shows the synthesis process of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs, which is synthesized by passing Cl2 into [Bmim][Cl] ILs, resulting in the disappearance of crystal particles and the formation of yellow liquid. Fig. S8 shows the Raman spectrum of the reaction product, demonstrating the formation of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs. It also show a sharp peak at 273–280 cm-1, which belongs to the symmetric stretching of the linear [Cl3]- anion. The preparation method of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is the same as Au-Cl/AC catalyst. Fig. S9 shows Au-Cl3/AC catalyst, which is a type Ⅰ adsorption isotherm. Tab. S1 shows that the surface area and pore volume of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is 1048 m2 g-1 and 0.53 cm-3 g-1. In contrast, Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is slightly smaller. However, the effect on the catalytic effect is almost negligible. Fig. S10 shows that the XRD detection of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst did not detect the sharp edge of the characteristic crystal plane of gold nanoparticles. Further, the dispersion and the morphology of catalysts were measured (Fig. S11). Compared with elemental mapping of Fig. S12, Au-Cl3/AC catalyst has more chlorine content, and the morphology of the catalyst surface and the dispersion of the active center remains unchanged. To further confirm the single-atom dispersion in Au-Cl3/AC catalyst, it is necessary to use HAADF-STEM. Fig. 2a-b show the superiority of the microenvironment changed after the introduction of ILs, suggesting that gold species are dispersed on the surface of AC at the atomic level. Although there is photoreduction during the XPS detection, Fig. 2c shows the valence distribution of monatomic gold in Au-Cl3/AC catalyst and all valence states of the Au is + 3, which also shows [Bmim][Cl3] ILs has the effect of self-oxidation Au3+. Coordination environment and electronic structure of Au species were measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the atomic scale. Fig. 2d shows the Au L3-edge XANES spectra of Au foil, KAuCl4, (PPh3)AuCH3, and fresh Au-Cl3/AC catalyst. EXAFS fitting parameters at the Au L3-edge for various samples are placed in Tab. S5. The white line heights of the three samples (KAuCl4, (PPh3)AuCH3, and Au foil) are 1.14, 0.81, and 0.76 respectively [9,38]. It verifies the higher the height of the white line, the stronger the oxidation state of the cationic gold. The height of the white line of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is almost coincident with that of KAuCl4, suggesting that isolated Au atoms bear a positive charge of + 3. This result also shows that the cationic gold species does not exist in the form of mixed valence state Au3+/Au+, but in the form of single valence state Au3+. The difference in the valence state of gold may be attributed to the coordination structure of the Au atoms. FT-EXAFS was used to investigate the coordination environment of the Au atoms. In Tab. S5, the coordination environment of the cationic gold in Au-Cl3/AC is Au-Cl entities at about 2.27 Å with no Au-Au entities (CNs = 12, R = 2.86 Å), and average CNs is 3.4. Compared with the previous work, the average CNs in Au-Cl/AC catalyst is 3.0 [21]. These results suggest that cationic gold with more Au-Cl entities presents higher stability. Fig. 2f shows that the C2H2 conversion reached 51.2% and there was no tendency of deactivation after 20 h. It is noted that the strategy of constructing the SILP system for self-oxidation of the Au3+ active center is successful. Further, the catalysts were reacted at GHSV (C2H2) = 3000 h-1 and GHSV (C2H2) = 4500 h-1, respectively. At GHSV (C2H2) = 3000 h-1, the conversion acetylene is 35%. After 20 h, the acetylene conversion remains at 35%. At GHSV (C2H2) = 4500 h 1, the initial acetylene conversion was 25%, the highest acetylene conversion was 28%. After 20 h, acetylene conversion decreased slowly to 21%. To demonstrate the stability of the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst, a linear relationship between the VCM production and deactivation rate was established and compared with the reported Au-based catalysts in the literatures [21,26,27,34,39–44]. Fig. 3h shows that the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst has the highest VCM productivity, while the deactivation rate is close to zero. Furthermore, the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst exhibits excellent VCM production capacity, and the linear correlation between VCM productivity and GHSV shows that it still maintains the best VCM production capacity at high space velocity in Fig. 2i. These results suggest that the strategy of modifying [Bmim][Cl] ILs to generate [Bmim][Cl3] ILs is beneficial to the catalytic activity and stability of the Au-SILP system in acetylene hydrochlorination. 3.3 Description of structure-activity relationship The long lifetime and high activity of the self-oxidation Au3+ active sites SILP system have been proved through acetylene hydrochlorination reaction. Before discussing the structure-activity relationship, it is necessary to exclude the influence of the physical structures of the AC after a long reaction. Fig. 3a and Tab. S1 show that the adsorption isotherm of the catalyst negligible change, which is still a type Ⅰ adsorption isotherm. The specific surface area and pore structure of AC decreased from 1048 m2 g-1 and 0.53 cm-3 g-1 to 1018 m2 g-1 and 600 cm-3 g-1, respectively, which indicated that Au-SILP system will effectively inhibit carbon deposition and prevent catalyst deactivation [13,21]. Fig. 3b-c show that the gold species is still well dispersed on the surface of the AC with single atoms, and no gold nanoparticles are detected. The elemental mappings also verified that there was a homogeneous distribution of N, Cl, and Au atoms on AC support. Compared with the used Au-Cl/AC catalyst (Fig. 1i), Au-Cl3/AC catalyst shows no aggregation of gold species. As we know, independently existing AuCl3 is unstable, which will dissociate and aggregate during the reaction. The stability of Au-Cl with high CNs are several orders of magnitude higher than that of Au-Cl/AC catalyst with Au-Cl coordination before modification, which increases the energy barrier for gold migration and inhibits the agglomeration of cationic gold. Fig. 3d shows the Au L3-edge XANES spectra of the used Au-Cl3/AC catalyst. The height of the white line of the used Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is 1.14, which has not changed compared with fresh Au-Cl3/AC catalyst (Fig. 2e). Fig. S7 shows local structure evolution around active sites. The used Au-Cl3/AC catalyst shows the presence of Au-Cl entities at about 2.27 Å, which is the same as the fresh sample. After high space velocity acetylene hydrochlorination, the Au-Cl CNs decreased from 3.4 to 3.3. The phenomenon of a strong reduction of gold active sites by acetylene as a reducing agent still exists, but the [Bmim][Cl3] ILs with autoxidation property can oxidize low-valence metallic Au to high-valence gold species. At the same time, part of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs are transformed into [Bmim][Cl] ILs. Furthermore, the wavelet transform data (WT, Fig. 3e) shows the maximum WT intensities at ∼7 Å-1 for both fresh and used samples, thus, the difference between them is negligible. It is clear that the gold species in the used Au-Cl3/AC catalyst exists in monatomic gold, and Au atoms bear a positive charge of + 3. It is also presented that [Bmim][Cl3] ILs can self-oxidize Au0 to Au3+ and achieve the purpose of stabilizing the catalyst. Previously, Hutchings evaluated the catalytic activity of more than 20 metal catalysts under the same evaluation conditions, and believed that the reactivity of the acetylene hydrochlorination catalyst was closely related to the electrode potential of the metal, showing a trend that the higher the metal electrode potential, the higher catalytic activity [45]. In addition, cationic gold was detected in the form of Au3+ by XPS and XAS characterization. The electronic properties of the cationic Au species stabilized by Au-Cl3/AC catalyst were further investigated by Hirshfeld charge analysis. Fig. 3f-g show electron density and the Hirshfeld charge of the Au atoms in various Au states. The Hirshfeld charge value of the gold species in the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is 0.447 e, while the value of Au-Cl/AC catalyst is 0.402 e. Chloride ions act as an electron acceptor to form coordination bond with Au3+. The thermodynamic stability of Au+ is higher than that of Au3+, which can be obtained by the thermal decomposition of Au3+. Therefore, the high stability of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is based on the high CNs and the ability of ILs to oxidize cationic gold. Au-Cl3/AC catalyst also exhibited higher Hirshfeld charge than Au-Cl/AC catalyst when adsorbing reactants or products in different reaction stages of acetylene hydrochlorination. To the best of our knowledge, acetylene is preferentially activated with Au3+ as the active center of acetylene hydrochlorination. The C2H2-Au adsorption intermediates that fail to react in time will be reduced to Au nanoparticles. Therefore, improving the interaction between HCl and the adsorption intermediate is beneficial to the reaction. It is clear that the more positive the Hirshfeld charge, the greater the degree of electron loss from the Au atom. Electron-deficient gold species can form a greater adsorption effect with HCl, which will be discussed in the mechanistic section. In the study of Au/AC and Au-Cl/AC catalysts, it was found that the deactivation of the catalyst mainly comes from the agglomeration of Au species, although the presence of [Bmim][Cl] ILs inhibited the effect of the agglomeration of the Au species. In the process, there will still be a phenomenon that the gold nanoparticles are reduced by acetylene [12,46]. However, [Bmim][Cl3] ILs have the function of self-oxidation the active center of high-valent gold, which is manifested in the direct conversion of Au0 into Au3+. Fig. 4 shows the proposed self-oxidation mechanism for Au0 by [Bmim][Cl3] ILs over the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst. During the reaction process, Au3+ is reduced by acetylene to generate Au0. [Bmim][Cl3] ILs has the self-oxidation ability to convert Au0 into Au3+. At this time, [Bmim][Cl3] ILs are converted into [Bmim][Cl] ILs, which means that even if [Bmim][Cl3] ILs is completely reacted, the generated Au-Cl/AC catalyst has ability to proceed with acetylene hydrochlorination. To further verify that [Bmim][Cl3] ILs has the ability of self-oxidation gold nanoparticles. Fig. 4 shows the hybrid solution of gold nanoparticles and [Bmim][Cl3] ILs. The gold nanoparticles at the bottom of the glass bottle gradually dissolved over time, and then completely disappeared in the third bottle. It proves that [Bmim][Cl3] ILs has the ability to oxidize gold nanoparticles. A similar active center reactivation strategy has also been reported by Zhao to oxidize Au0 with Cu2+ to obtain Au+/Au3+ [46]. However, the advantage of using ionic liquids as sacrificial agents to self-oxidize gold active sites are that ILs exist in the form of liquids, and anions and cations in ionic liquids have the ability to migrate. Although [Bmim][Cl3] ILs and gold nanoparticles are far away, [Bmim][Cl3] ILs can still migrate to the surface of gold nanoparticles through ion movement. Therefore, the strategy of using [Bmim][Cl3] ILs as a sacrificial agent to self-oxidation the active center can efficiently utilize each [Bmim][Cl3] molecule. It fully conforms to the concept of green chemistry advocated by modern chemistry. At the same time, the cost of recovery of single metal loading is lower than that of multi-metal. 3.4 Proposed mechanism To deeply understand the mechanism of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst and Au-Cl/AC catalyst in acetylene hydrochlorination, each elementary step is discussed by DFT calculation [47]. Fig. 5 shows the main six steps in the acetylene hydrochlorination catalytic cycle reaction of catalysts: (step 1) separate adsorption of C2H2 and HCl, (step 2) co-adsorption of C2H2 and HCl, (step 3) first transition state, (step 4) formation of reaction intermediates, (step 5) second reaction intermediate, and (Step 6) formation of VCM. Adsorption energy as a descriptor of activation energy has a linear relationship with the degree of activation, and a larger adsorption energy between C2H2 and cationic gold can effectively activate C2H2 [11,48] . The activation mechanism of the reaction is related to the valence state of the cationic gold species. Step 1 shows that there is a clear advantage in the competitive adsorption of C2H2 and HCl. At the same time, in step 3, C2H2 is activated and transition state is formed between the cationic gold. It indicates that Au3+ active center preferentially activates C2H2 consistent with literature reports [9,10,49]. And the path of Au-C2H2 adsorption configuration reaction will be blocked if the adsorption energy of C2H2 is too high or there is no HCl to attack the adsorption intermediate state of C2H2 in time. Therefore, how to effectively control the adsorption energy of gold species on C2H2 is the key to the efficient catalysis of Au-SILP system. Comparison of adsorption energies of Au-Cl/AC and Au-Cl3/AC catalysts for acetylene which are 34.50 and 42.97 kJ mol-1, and the configuration after adsorption is shown in Fig. S15-S16. The Hirshfeld charge analysis of the gold species before and after adsorption presents that the average Hirshfeld charge on gold atoms in Au-Cl3/AC catalyst did not change, while the Hirshfeld charge of gold atoms in Au-Cl/AC catalyst increased from 0.401 e to 0.406 e. It shows that C2H2 accepts part of the electrons provided by Au atoms as the electron acceptor in the Au-Cl/AC catalyst. On the contrary, due to the higher CNs of cations in Au-Cl3/AC catalyst, the Au active sites are in a more stable state and C2H2 hardly exchanges electrons. The same results were obtained when analyzing the adsorption energy and Hirshfeld charge between HCl and cationic gold. The adsorption energy of HCl on Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is smaller and the Hirshfeld charge of cationic gold does not change. Therefore, the [Bmim][Cl3] ILs modified with Cl2 can effectively improve the stability of the catalyst by increasing the CNs of cationic gold. Step 2 shows the competitive adsorption of C2H2 and HCl on Au-Cl/AC and Au-Cl3/AC catalysts. The adsorption sites of C2H2 are cationic gold. The adsorption of HCl occurs on the Cl atom to form the adsorption site of Cl-H…Cl structure (“-” represents intramolecular interactions and “…” represents intermolecular interactions). And the adsorption energy of Au-Cl3/AC catalysts is − 37.56 kJ mol-1, while the adsorption energy of Au-Cl/AC catalyst is − 48.99 kJ mol-1. It indicates that high CNs are beneficial to reduce the direct electron transfer between cationic gold and C2H2. Step 3 shows that the energy barrier of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is 95.88 kJ mol-1, which is lower than 131.32 kJ mol-1 of Au-Cl/AC catalyst. And this step is the rate-controlling step of the reaction. In the Au-Cl/AC catalyst, the triple bond of C2H2 is broken to form a C-Cl bond with the Cl atom provided by the cationic gold, and the other end of the C2H2 forms a C-Au bond. Sufficient energy is required to break the stable coordinating Au-Cl bond in this process. In the Au-Cl3/AC catalyst, One end of the activated C2H2 forms a bond with cationic gold to form an Au-C bond, and the other end does not need to break the original Au-Cl bond when forming a C-Cl bond, only needs to fbreak the Cl-Cl bond. Step 4 is to optimize the transition state to obtain a relatively stable reaction intermediate. Step 5 is the second transition state, which needs to dissociate HCl. In the Au-Cl/AC catalyst, activated HCl donates H atom to C2H2Cl-Au to form a C-H bond while forming a new Au-Cl bond with cationic gold. The difference is that the Cl atom in the HCl and the Cl atom in the catalyst form Cl-Cl bond in the Au-Cl3/AC catalytic process. The energy barriers that Au-Cl/AC and Au-Cl3/AC catalysts need to overcome in the dissociation of HCl are 22.0 kJ mol-1 and 30.59 kJ mol-1, respectively This also explains why the catalytic activity of Au-Cl3/AC catalyst is higher than that of Au-Cl/AC catalyst. The sixth step is the formation of an adsorbed C2H3Cl product. Since the binding energy between C2H3Cl and Au3+ is low, it is easy to fall off the surface of the active sites to form C2H3Cl. 4 Conclusion In this study, we systematically investigated the deactivation mechanism in Au-SILP system in acetylene hydrochlorination, and the single-atom Au catalyst with industrial potential was prepared. The catalyst show excellent catalytic activity when the active sites are completely replaced by highly oxidized Au3+ sites to coexisting in the Au3+/Au+ sites. High CNs Au-Cl entities reduce the electron transfer between Au3+ and C2H2 and weaken the adsorption of C2H2 on the gold active site, which improves the stability of the catalyst. Theoretical calculations also prove that Au-Cl3/AC catalysts have a lower reaction energy in the reaction rate-limiting step and exhibit higher catalytic activity in acetylene hydrochlorination. Importantly, the strong oxidation ability of [Bmim][Cl3] ILs makes Au-Cl3/AC catalyst show the property of self-oxidation. This work not only provides new methods for the design of active sites and the modification of ILs, but also provide a solution for the large-scale industrialization of gold catalysts in acetylene hydrochlorination.

        "dc:description": "There is great potential for carbon-supported gold catalysts to replace toxic mercuric chloride-based catalysts in the acetylene hydrochlorination, which is a key process for producing PVC. However, the catalyst design is essentially hindered by the difficulties in enhancing the catalytic activity of cationic gold and suppressing the deactivation of active species. We report a strategy for self-oxidation of Au3+ by the Au-SILP system with the [Bmim][Cl3] ILs. This strategy can stabilize all gold species in the state of highly oxidized Au3+ instead of coexisting in the Au3+/Au+ site, which makes the catalyst exhibit excellent catalytic activity. High coordination numbers Au-Cl entities reduce the electron transfer between Au3+ and C2H2 and weaken the adsorption of C2H2 on the Au active sites. Furthermore, [Bmim][Cl3] ILs can self-oxidize gold nanoparticles on the support surface into Au3+. This study provides a new method for improving the stability and activity of gold-based acetylene hydrochlorination catalysts.",
