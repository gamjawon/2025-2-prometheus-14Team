It is demonstrated that after He pretreatment, catalysts with high Re ion density show higher activity if the reaction is carried out at a higher temperature. In contrast, after propene pretreatment, the catalyst with low Re ion density displays higher activity at lower temperature. XPS spectra of Re^ for the catalyst after reaction imply that the surface species are composed of Re ions in different valence states more reduced when pretreated with propene, less reduced when pretreated with helium. Unfortunately it is still not possible to confirm what species are responsible for propene metathesis over Re207/ AlgOs catalysts pretreated with He and/or propene. Introduction Supported ReaOy/AlgOa is a typical catalyst in olefin metathesis because of its high activity and selectivity under mild reaction conditions [1]. Many attempts have been made to identify the oxidation state and structure of the active surface rhenium oxide species and its function in olefin metathesis by using various sophisticated physical and/or physicochemical methods [2-9]. According to the results of IR (infrared), LRS (laser raman) and XPS measurements, it is well known that rhenium oxide species form a monolayer in the ReaOy/AlgOs catalyst after calcination in air. It has been demonstrated that the vibrational frequency of the stretching mode of the Re 0 bond in the surface species of rhenium oxide is the same as in the perrhenate ion in aqueous solution: only Re04- units with a distorted tetrahedral symmetry can be detected on the surface [5 7]. Recently Hardcastle et al. [7] pointed out that the surface coverage by [ReC^'lacis decreases with increasing cal- cination temperature. They assume that [Re04~]ads is able to recombine to form gaseous RegC^ during calcination. These authors also claimed that even *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/91/S3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 276 in high Re-loading catalysts no [RegOyJads could be detected on the surface. On the other hand Nakamura et al. [8] reported their study using in situ IR and showed that there are bands characteristic for dimeric species of [Re^OyLds on the surface if the catalyst has a high Re loading. In our previous study [4, 9] concerning the effect of pretreatment of ReaOy/AlgOs on its activity and selectivity for propene metathesis, we found that after calcination in air the rhenium oxide species in supported RegC^/ AlgOa catalyst are in a monolayer state, and their activity for propene metathesis is strongly dependent on the pretreatment. Based on ESR measurements and their correlation with the specific activity, we have suggested that the metathesis of propene by a Re207/Ala03 catalyst pretreated with N3 at high temperatures, proceeds mainly on dimeric species of [RegC^lads, while in the catalyst pretreated with propene at 723 K a surface species Re^ O AP3 is responsible for the reaction. Since Og chemisorption on the propene-pretreated catalyst can lead to the formation of Og\" ions, (which is similar to the behaviour found if the catalyst is reduced by Hg) we proposed that n should be smaller than + 7, possibly equal to + 6 or +4. In this work, we report the temperature dependence of propene metathesis over supported ReaOy/AlgOs catalysts treated by He and/or propene, and the results of XPS measurements on these samples. In addition, a curve-fitting programme for the double peaks of the Ke^ level was used to analyze the distribution of various oxidation states of Re ions on the surface with the aim to find a relation between the possible precursor of active sites and the specific activity of Re207/Al20g catalysts. Experimental Materials ReaOy/AlaOa catalysts with RegOy contents ranging from 3-20% were prepared by impregnation, as mentioned in the previous paper [4]. The purity of He was 99.99%. Other gases used in the pretreatment and reaction were purified by conventional methods. Propene was of 'polymerisation degree' purity and was passed through a zeolite trap to remove traces of water. Reaction Propene metathesis was studied in a pulse reactor system attached to a multichannel mass spectrometer. Data acquiring and processing were carried out by a computer system. Further treatment of the data obtained from the mass spectrometer was followed using the method of relative correction factors as suggested by Ko et al. [10]. The conversion of propene QX) can be estimated in terms of the production of butene as follows: X=2[C,2-]/{2[C^-]+[C32-]} The specific activity is defined as the molecules of propene converted per Re ion on the surface for one pulse of propene. (1 pulse =2xl018 277 molecules of propene). Usually the catalyst loading in the reactor was 100 mg. Two kinds of pretreatments were imposed on the catalyst: (1) He pretreatment: the catalyst was pretreated with He stream at a flow rate of 36 ml min\"1 at 823 K for 1 h and then cooled to the reaction temperature. (2) Propene pretreatment: 30 pulses of propene were passed through the catalyst at 723 K; it was then flushed with He for 15 min, heated to 823 K for 1 h and cooled to the reaction temperature. After reaction the catalyst was collected for XPS measurement. XPS measurements XPS data were obtained with a VG ESCALAB MK II spectrometer using Mg Ka X-ray excitation source (1253.6 eV). The base pressure in the UHV chamber was 2x 10~10 mbar and the pressure was maintained at 3x 10~9 mbar during measurements. A powdered sample was stuck on a double-faced tape. The charge effect was corrected in terms of the binding energy of Cis (284.6 eV). The relative atomic ratio was calculated using integrated peak areas as expressed in the following formula: M /^2 = (A /h^/v^E^/E^112 where N is the number of atoms concerned, / is the intensity of XPS peak estimated from the integrated peak areas, o- is the cross-section of ionization and E^ is the kinetic energy of the electrons concerned. Deconvolution of the XPS spectra of Re^ was carried out using a PHI 5500 multifunction analog computer. A curve-fitting programme suitable for double peaks, such as Re^, was used [11]. Fitting parameters were obtained from the literature [12] or measured using pure chemicals. Results and discussion Temperature dependence of propene metathesis over supported Re i0^ /Al^Oy catalysts The specific activities of various Regt^/AlgOs catalysts in propene me- tathesis, pretreated with He at 823 K, and their temperature dependences are shown in Fig. 1. It is obvious that the specific activity of the catalysts increases with increasing Re ion density on the surface. Moreover, the proportional coefficient becomes much larger as the reaction temperature increases. However, if the Re ion density exceeds 2.3 Re ions nm~2, the specific activities will decrease with increasing Re ion density. The higher the reaction temperature, the more marked the decrease in specific activities. 278 30 20 10 Re ions/nm^ Fig. 1. Variations in the specific activity of RegC^/AlgC^ after He pretreatment as a function of the surface density of Re ions. (0), (D) and (0) reaction at 363, 408 and 453 K respectively. Aldag et al. [13] pointed out that, based on their experimental results and calculations, the saturated monolayer capacity for ReaOa/AlgOa catalyst is 2.7 Re ions nm~2. Therefore, all Re^Of species are in a monolayer state on the surface of alumina support in our case. Figure 1 suggests that if the Re ion density is close to the saturation capacity, the binding of a part of RegOy with the surface of alumina is not strong enough and will be 'washed on\" during reaction. (This will be confirmed later by XPS measurements.) Further, it follows from Fig. 1 that Re^/M^Oy catalysts after He pretreatment exhibit higher specific activities if the reaction temperatures are higher. The performance of the catalysts pretreated with propene is totally different from that pretreated with He. Fig. 2 shows that the temperature effect becomes negative in this case, i.e. the higher the reaction temperature, the lower the specific activities. Also, the catalysts with low Re loading display higher specific activity compared to those with higher Re loading. All these facts demonstrate that the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites created with different pretreatments are quite specific. 279 40 30 10 0 1 2 Re ions/nm- Fig. 2.

XPS characterisation In the previous paper we reported the results of XPS measurements on a fresh ReaOy/AlaOs catalyst. Here we will focus on the samples after reaction. Figures 3 and 4 show the dependence of the atomic ratio of Re/Al measured by XPS on the Re ion density of the used catalysts pretreated with He and/or propene. It is obvious that the atomic ratio of Re/Al on the surface of the catalyst pretreated with He and/or propene follows almost the same trends. When the Re ion density is low (<1.5 Re ions nm~2), it will 280 0.10 \" 0.05 0.0 Re ions/run^ Fig. 3. Relationship between the atomic ratio of Re/Al and the surface density of Re ions in the used catalyst after He pretreatment. linearly increase with increasing Re ion density, nearly the same as in the fresh sample. However, when the Re ion density is higher, (> 1.5 Re ions nm\"2), the increase is definitely slower. Duquette et al. reported similar results [14]. They attributed this behaviour to coke formed during the reaction leading to a 'wash-off effect for a part of Rea07 not strongly bound with alumina surface. Although the catalysts pretreated with propene suffered severe coking, the atomic ratio C/Re on the surface of the catalyst pretreated with He and propene changes with the Re ion density in the same way. (see Figs. 5 and 6). Obviously, the fact that part of RegOy was 'washed off during the reaction may be responsible for the decrease in the specific activity with the high Re-loading catalyst. In addition, it also implies that the differences in the performance of propene metathesis on the catalysts pretreated with He and propene should be attributed to differences in the active sites involved. Oxidation state of Re ions on Re^O^/Al^Oy catalysts Because of the formation of benzene during pretreatment with propene, it is expected that the reduction of these catalysts should be more marked 281 0.10 0.05 0.0 Re ions/run2 Fig. 4. Relationship between the atomic ratio of Re/Al and the surface density of Re ions in the used catalyst after propene pretreatment. than of those pretreated with He. In order to analyze the distribution of oxidation states of Re ions on the surface, a suitable curve-fitting programme was used. The results suggest the existence of four different Re ions with four different oxidation states on the surface, i.e. 7 +, 6 +, 4 + and 3 +, if we want to obtain good fitting results, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Table 1 lists the distribution of oxidation states of Re ions on various Regt^/AlaOa catalysts after He and propene pretreatments and reaction. It is obvious that the percentage of Re7\"1\" ion in Re207/Al203 catalysts with propene pretreatment is usually lower than in those with He pretreatment, while the percentage of Re34\" is higher in the former case. This gives evidence that propene pretreatment leads to considerable reduction of the catalysts. The percentage of Re7'1\" in the catalysts pretreated with He increases with increasing Re ion density and reaches a maximum at R15A, which corresponds to 1.5 Re ions nm~2. Combined with the reaction results, it seems reasonable to suppose that the possible precursor of the active sites is a dimeric species of [Re'^ O Re^lads on the high Re-loading catalyst. 282 15 10 0 1 2 Re ions/nm^ Fig. 5. Relationship between the atomic ratio of C/Re and the surface density of Re ions in the used catalyst after He pretreatment. The higher the Re loading on the surface, the less to be destroyed by He pretreatment and reactions, which lead to greater opportunities to form dimeric species on the surface. Half of the Re^ still remains on the surface after propene pretreatment and reaction. The quite different reaction behaviour suggests dimeric species are destroyed by propene pretreatment. Higher specific activity only can be obtained at conditions where the reaction temperature is rather low and the Re ion density is also low. Here a monomeric species may be a possible choice for the precursor of active sites under these circumstances. Unfor- tunately, it seems impossible on the basis of the data yet obtained to confirm what monomeric species were the precursors of the active sites. 283 o 10 0 0 1 2 Re ions/na2 Fig. 6. Relationship between the atomic ratio of C/Re and the surface density of Re ions in the used catalyst after propene pretreatment. Conclusion (1) It is demonstrated that after He pretreatment, the catalyst with higher Re ion density shows higher activity; the activity increases if the reaction is carried out at a higher temperature. In contrast, after propene pretreatment, the catalyst with low Re ion density displays higher activity; the temperature effect on its performance is negative. This is evidence that the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites created with these different pretreatments are quite different. (2) XPS spectra of Re4f for the catalyst after reaction imply that the surface species are composed of Re ions in different valence states.
