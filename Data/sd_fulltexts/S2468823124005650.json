It is the key to develop an efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst that can catalyze both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In this study, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) decorated with MnO2 were synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition of manganese carbonyl. MnO2 and nitrogen species as active sites showed enhanced ORR/OER activities compared to NCNTs. A small amount of MnO2 can catalyze the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide resulted in an overall four-electron reduction of oxygen. The electrochemical stability studies revealed that NCNTs decorated with MnO2 exhibited a slower decrease in OER activity and maintained a relatively higher ORR activity than NCNTs, which proves its high potential in ORR and OER catalysis under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the NCNTs decorated with MnO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance in Zn-air batteries.

It is urgent to promote the development of clean and renewable energy sources. The rechargeable zinc-air batteries have attracted excellent attention in the application of wearable and portable equipment due to their high volume energy density [1,2]. However, their energy conversion efficiency is strongly limited by the large overpotential derived from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The most efficient electrocatalysts have been identified as platinum for the ORR and ruthenium and iridium oxides for the OER. Pt-based catalysts are widely investigated as electrocatalysts for the ORR because of their unrivaled activity, but they exhibit low activity for the OER [3,4]. Ruthenium and iridium oxides are the most effective OER catalysts, while their ORR activity is significantly lower compared to Pt [5,6]. Therefore, the development of high-active, low cost and durable catalysts that can accomplish both of these reactions remains a challenge. Recently, oxides of transition metals, such as Ni, Fe, Co and Mn, as protruding candidates in catalyzing both the ORR and OER, have attracted considerable attention [7–12]. Among them, manganese oxides have an ever increasing interest owing to their high abundance, low cost and appropriate activity and stability performances. The ORR/OER performance of manganese-oxide catalysts is related to their morphologies, composition and preparation process [13]. However, these oxides generally have intrinsically low conductivity, which fortunately, can be mitigated by doping heteroatoms, tuning morphologies, or anchoring them onto conductive substrates such as carbon materials [14,15]. In particular, N-doped carbon materials have been widely regarded as not only the metal-free catalysts for the ORR but also as conductive supports that enhance the materials’ ability to electrocatalyze both the ORR and the OER. This is due to the promoted electron transfer and greatly improved electrical conductance resulting from the free electrons contributed by nitrogen [16–20]. Enormous results have shown that metal oxides supported on N-doped carbon exhibited much higher ORR and OER activities compared to metal oxides and the physical mixture of N-doped carbon and metal oxides. Our previous results also demonstrated that transition metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon had lower reversible overpotentials in the ORR and the OER under alkaline conditions compared to pristine RuO2, IrO2 and Pt/C [21,22]. Furthermore, the lone pair of electrons in nitrogen atoms can enhance the coupling between the support and the metal oxide by inducing additional negative charges in the delocalized π system, thereby improving catalytic performance [23]. The strong interaction between metal oxides and N-doped carbon materials often results in low contact resistance, reducing the overpotential and enhancing ORR/OER activities, as well as long-term stability. However, conventional preparation methods, such as impregnation, cannot be easily achieved. Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) has been considered a useful method for synthesizing supported catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, few reports have been published on supported manganese oxide successfully synthesized by MOCVD that can be used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR and the OER under alkaline conditions. Here, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes decorated with highly dispersed manganese oxide were synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) in a vertical reactor using manganese carbonyl (Mn2(CO)10) as the Mn precursor. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of bifunctional catalysts were investigated in both the ORR and the OER under alkaline conditions. The discharge/charge performance and power density were tested in Zn-air batteries. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis of MnO2/NCNTs catalysts Oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared and used as substrates for the deposition of manganese oxide. Firstly, the metal catalysts in the CNTs and catalytically grown NCNTs were removed by stirring for 72 h in a diluted HNO3 solution at room temperature. The washed NCNTs are denoted as NCNT-growth. The washed CNTs were oxidized in HNO3 vapor at 200 °C for 72 h to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups, which is denoted as OCNTs [24]. OCNTs were treated at 200, 400, 600 and 800 °C for 6 h under flowing ammonia (10 vol.% NH3 in Ar) at a flow rate of 50 sccm to synthesize nitrogen-doped CNTs in a tubular reactor with an inner diameter of 30 mm. The obtained NCNTs are denoted as NCNT-NH3–200, NCNT-NH3–400, NCNT-NH3–600 and NCNT-NH3–800, respectively. Supported manganese oxide (MnO2) was achieved through metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of manganese carbonyl (Mn2(CO)10). Mn2(CO)10 (98 %, Aldrich) was used as the Mn precursor. Oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotubes were used as the support. 30 mg of Mn2(CO)10 and 300 mg of oxygen- or nitrogen-functionalized CNTs were mixed by grinding in an agate mortar for 5 min in a glove box under inert conditions. The mixture was then removed and transferred into a vertical tube connected to a vacuum system. The tube was heated from room temperature to 300 °C at a pressure of 0.1 mbar following a temperature-programmed process (Fig. 1 ), which resulted in the gradual sublimation of the precursor and the formation of manganese oxide. The theoretical loading of Mn was about 2.74 wt.%. The obtained catalysts were ground in an agate mortar for electrochemical analysis. 2.2 Characterization The manganese content was analyzed using ICP-OES on the PU701 instrument from Philips-Unicam. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded from 10 to 80° in a SmartLab X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to identify the chemical states of the elements. The obtained samples were placed in the measurement chamber of an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) setup equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source and a high-resolution analyzer (Gammadata-Scienta SES 2002). The XP spectra of elements were analyzed quantitatively using the CASA XPS program. 2.3 Electrochemical tests Before the electrochemical tests, 1.0 mg of the catalyst was ultrasonicated in a solution containing 95 μL of water, 95 μL of ethanol and 4 µL Nafion® (5 %) for 30 min. 3.0 μL of the highly dispersed suspension was loaded onto a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon disk that had been polished by grinding with alumina pastes on a polishing cloth. After drying in air at room temperature, the glassy carbon modified with a catalyst loading of 210 µg cm− 2 was used as the working electrode. The electrochemical activities of the catalysts were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements in a conventional three-electrode cell, with a Pt foil serving as the counter electrode. The Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl electrode was selected as the reference electrode and calibrated based on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All experiments were performed on an electrochemical workstation PGSTAT12 (Eco Chemie, The Netherlands) equipped with a rotating disc electrode rotator (IPS-RRDE/RDE, Germany). The CV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s −1 in argon- or oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH at room temperature. In the RDE measurements, each LSV curve of the catalyst was obtained in oxygen-saturated electrolyte, which was deducted the scanned voltammogram in the Ar-saturated electrolyte. The rechargeable zinc-air battery was assembled using hydrophobic carbon paper modified with the catalyst as the cathode and a commercial zinc plate as the anode in a 6 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte. The discharge/charge performance and power density of the battery were performed on a CHI760E instrument. 3 Results and discussion The catalytic activities of nitrogen-doped CNTs obtained by post-treatment of OCNTs with NH3 at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 . The NCNT-NH3–600 sample exhibited the most positive onset potential, while the NCNT-NH3–400 sample had a higher diffusion-limited current compared to the other samples. Hence, the NCNT-NH3–400 and NCNT-NH3–600 samples were selected as the supports for further studies. As shown in Table 1 , the Mn content in the four samples ranged from 1.83 to 1.87 wt.%, as measured by ICP-OES. No contributions from Mn2(CO)10 were discernible in the XRD patterns of all four samples (Fig. 3 ), indicating that the precursors had decomposed completely. Only two diffraction peaks at approximately 26.0° and 42.8° assigned to the (002) and (100) diffraction peaks of the functionalized CNTs were observed [25]. The diffraction peaks of the functionalized CNTs shift to smaller 2θ angles than those of carbon nanotubes, which was attributed to the incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen into the carbon lattices [26]. There were no diffraction peaks assignable to manganese oxides, indicating that the amount of manganese oxide was too low to be detected by XRD. As a typical example, SEM and TEM images of the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample were observed (Fig. S1). It can be seen from Fig. S2 that the N and Mn elements were uniformly dispersed in the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample. The composition of manganese oxide supported on oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized CNTs was analyzed by high-resolution XPS measurements. It can be observed form the C 1 s XP spectra of all the samples (Fig. 4a ) that the MnO2/NCNT-growth sample displayed a much broader peak at 284.5 eV compared to the other samples, which is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen during the growth process [27]. However, there were no notable differences in the C 1 s spectra of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–400 and MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 compared to MnO2/OCNTs, indicating that the structure of OCNTs remained unchanged after post-treatment with NH3. Fig. 4b shows the XP N 1 s spectra of the supported manganese oxide catalysts, deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.5 eV (pyridinic-N), 400.5 eV (pyrrolic-N) and 401.5 eV (quaternary-N) [28,29]. The intensity of nitrogen groups was a clearly higher for MnO2/NCNT-growth than those of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–400 and MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 in the N 1 s region. For the case of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–400, only pyridinic- and pyrrolic-type nitrogen species were distinct, suggesting the absence or low composition of quaternary-type nitrogen. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the enhanced ORR activity of NCNTs is correlated with the ratio of pyridinic-N to quaternary-N under alkaline conditions [16,30]. Therefore, the XP N 1 s spectra in Fig. 4b adequately explain the reasons for the higher catalytic activity of NCNT-NH3–600 compared to NCNT-NH3–400. The XP O 1 s spectra of the manganese oxide samples are shown in Fig. 4c. Three deconvoluted peaks were observed in the O 1 s region corresponding to metal oxide (530.2 eV), carbonyl (531.2 eV) and carbon-oxygen single bond (533.1 eV) [30,31]. The intensity of the CO groups in the MnO2/OCNTs sample was significantly higher than in the other samples. In the XP Mn 2p spectra of the supported manganese oxide catalysts (Fig. 4d), two spin-orbit peaks of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 were observed at binding energies of 641.8 and 653.6 eV, respectively, consistent with those of Mn (Ⅳ) as reported in the literature [31]. The oxidation state of manganese was further determined by the peak separation of 11.8 eV between the Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 lines [32]. Although there were no diffraction peaks of manganese oxide in Fig. 3, the XPS results confirm that MnO2 was indeed formed on the OCNT or NCNT supports. However, the interaction between Mn and N atoms cannot be observed in the XP Mn 2p spectra (Fig. 4d). It has been reported that the interaction between Mn and N atoms cannot be detected by XPS when the loading of manganese oxide is too low [33]. Cyclic voltammetry of the catalysts was measured in argon- and oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. As a typical example, it can be seen from the CV curves of MnO2/NCNT-growth (Fig. 5 ) that clear redox peaks were recorded in the argon-saturated electrolyte, attributed to redox reactions of MnO2. However, the catalytic current for oxygen reduction occurred at a potential of 0.92 V and peaked at 0.81 V in the oxygen-saturated electrolyte. The CVs of the other three samples displayed similar features (not shown). RDE measurements of the supported MnO2 electrocatalysts were subsequently performed in an oxygen-saturated electrolyte. As a typical example, the polarization curves of the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample at different rotation rates are shown in Fig. 6a . The current of oxygen reduction increases with the increasing rotation rate. The corresponding Koutecky-Levich plots at different potentials are converted from Fig. 6a. Linearity and parallelism of Koutecky-Levich plots demonstrate that the electron transfer number remains constant over the potential range from 0.7 V to 0.3 V. The electron transfer number (n) for all samples was calculated based on the slope of the corresponding K–L plots and K–L equations as reported in the literature [16]. The following parameters were used for the calculation: the oxygen concentration C0* = 1.2 × 10−3 mol L −1, the oxygen diffusion coefficient D0 = 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s −1 and the viscosity of the electrolyte v = 1.0 × 10−2 cm2 s −1 in the oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH. For the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample, the average number of electrons transferred (n) in the potential range from 0.7 V to 0.3 V was found to be 4.0, suggesting the predominant selectivity of a four-electron transfer pathway during the ORR. The value of n was found to be 2.9 for the NCNT-NH3–600 sample in our previous study [30]. The similar phenomenon can be observed in MnO2/NCNT-NH3–400, MnO2/NCNT-growth, and MnO2/OCNTs. The results suggest that the deposited MnO2 likely catalyzes the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide (HO2 −) to form OH− and O2. Fig. 7 shows LSV curves measured at a rotation rate of 100 rpm for all the samples. OCNTs and NCNT-growth were included for comparison. N-doped CNTs clearly exhibited higher ORR activity than OCNTs (see Fig. 2 and 7a), suggesting that the incorporation of nitrogen can enhance the catalytic activity of the carbon nanotubes in the ORR. The ORR activities of the supported MnO2 samples are shown in Fig. 7b. In the potential range from 1.0 to 0.6 V, the reduction of oxygen was controlled by both kinetics and diffusion for all the samples, while it mainly occurred under diffusion control below 0.6 V. Obviously, the MnO2/OCNTs sample exhibited higher activity than OCNTs as indicated by a higher onset potential and greater current densities (Fig. 7a). After the deposition of MnO2, the ORR activities of the MnO2 catalysts were all enhanced compared to OCNTs and nitrogen-doped CNTs. The ORR activity is expressed as the ratio of the current at 0.7 V in KOH to the actual mass of the catalysts are summarized in Table S1. Among the supported MnO2 catalysts, the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample exhibited significantly higher ORR activity compared to the other samples. The onset potentials of all the catalysts are ordered increasingly as MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 > MnO2/NCNT-growth > MnO2/NCNT-NH3–400 > MnO2/OCNTs (Fig. 7b). The Tafel slope of the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample was smaller than that of the other samples (Fig. S3). Therefore, the supported MnO2 catalysts showed excellent performance in the ORR under alkaline conditions with the MnO2 and nitrogen species serving as the active sites. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated using the same catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 8 . NCNT-NH3–600 exhibited much higher OER activity than the other supports. In particular, the catalytic activity of OCNTs was higher than that of NCNT-growth in the OER. Significant enhancement in the OER activity was observed after depositing MnO2 on the supports. Particularly, MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 showed the highest OER activity (Fig. 8b). The results clearly demonstrate that nitrogen-doped CNTs decorated with a lower amount of MnO2 serve as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst capable of catalyzing reversible oxygen reactions. The MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample with the best ORR and OER activities was selected for electrochemical stability studies. NCNT-NH3–600 was included for comparison. The test was carried out at constant potentials for 90 h in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The constant potentials were 1.77 V and 0.47 V vs. RHE for the OER and ORR, respectively. The initial potential was 0.47 V (ORR) in air-saturated KOH (0.1 M) for 3 h, and later switched to 1.77 V (OER) also for 3 h, and the cycle was repeated 15 times. The corresponding current-time (i-t) chronoamperometric responses are shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample exhibited a slower decrease in OER activity and maintained relatively higher ORR activity over the course of 90 h, compared to NCNT-NH3–600. The high stability of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 proves its high potential to be utilized as a practical bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER in real devices. To further investigate the electrochemical performance of NCNTs decorated with MnO2, the discharge/charge and power density were tested in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. The commercial 20 % Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst was selected for comparison. The discharge/charge polarization curves of the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 catalyst as shown in Fig. 10a , indicated that the catalyst can achieve a high discharge voltage of 1.23 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The corresponding power density profiles are shown in Fig. 10b. The maximum power density of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 was 98.0 mW cm−2, which is much larger than that of the 20 % Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. 4 Conclusion Nitrogen-doped CNTs decorated with MnO2 were synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of manganese carbonyl (Mn2(CO)10). The Mn content in the catalysts ranged from 1.83 to 1.87 wt.%. CV and RDE studies revealed that the MnO2 supported on NCNTs show higher ORR activity than NCNTs, as indicated by a higher onset potential and a higher reduction current. Manganese oxides are expected to catalyze the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen in addition to acting as active catalytic sites for ORR, resulting in an overall four-electron reduction of oxygen over the MnO2 supported on NCNTs. The supported MnO2 samples showed excellent catalytic activity for the OER under alkaline conditions, suggesting that MnO2 nanoparticles on NCNTs with the MnO2 and nitrogen species serving as active sites are efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and the OER. Electrochemical stability studies revealed that the MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 sample exhibits a slower decrease in OER activity and maintains a relatively higher ORR activity than NCNT-NH3–600 after 90 h. The performance of MnO2/NCNT-NH3–600 in the Zn-air battery also proved its high potential in ORR and OER catalysis.

        "dc:description": "It is the key to develop an efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst that can catalyze both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In this study, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) decorated with MnO2 were synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition of manganese carbonyl. MnO2 and nitrogen species as active sites showed enhanced ORR/OER activities compared to NCNTs. A small amount of MnO2 can catalyze the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide resulted in an overall four-electron reduction of oxygen. The electrochemical stability studies revealed that NCNTs decorated with MnO2 exhibited a slower decrease in OER activity and maintained a relatively higher ORR activity than NCNTs, which proves its high potential in ORR and OER catalysis under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the NCNTs decorated with MnO2 catalyst exhibited excellent performance in Zn-air batteries.",
