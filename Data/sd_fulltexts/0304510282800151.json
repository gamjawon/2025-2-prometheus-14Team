REACTIONS OF CTS-2-BUTENE OVER A MOLYBDENA-ALUMINA CATALYST OF VARYING EX'T`ENTS OF REDUCTION eFOZSEF ENGELHARDT*. JOSE GOLDWASSER, and w. KEITH HALL** Department of Chernisfry. Laboratory for Surface Studies. Uniuersity of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, ffilmaukee, Wf 53201 (US_A_) Summary The metathesis and isomerization of n-butenes on a molybdena-alumina (8 wt% Mo) catalyst of different extents of reduction were investigate using the microcatalytic pulse technique. The maxima in concentration which appeared at trams-2-butene-d4 formed. from the reaction of equimolar mixtures of cis-C l and cis-C Dg provided a measure of the extent of metathesis in the overall isomerizat='-on process- The conversion of cis- to trams-2-butene ula metadh.esis was nearly independent of the extent of reduction for all reduced catalysts. Non-metathetic double bond isomerization, including cis to trans -i_nterconversion, increased with reduction, but the Ibutene produced was efficiently converted to propene by cross metathesis with the cis-2-butene reactant, especially after the first pulse had been passed. Highest selectivity for a given metathesis reaction between two olefins is obtained for very zlightly reduced catalysts. Introduction During the past several years work in this laboratory has been focussed on defining the surface chemistry of molybdena-alumina catalysts and relating it to catalytic functions [I - 61 . A:t the same time, the isomerization reactions of the n-butenes have been investigated as a possible diagnostic tool to define the nature of the catalytic sites [7 - 101. The isomerization rate of 2-butenes has been fotuid to be significantly higher over reduced molybdena-alumina catalysts than over unreduced ones [11] . A similar increase in the metathesis activity (for propene) with reduction has been reported [12, 131 , aver reduced molyOEna-alun:Lina, common primary active sites have been proposed for metathesis, dimerization, *On leave from the Central Research Institute for Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest.

On the other hand, because only metathesis among these reactions was suppressed while others were accelerated by hydrogen adsorbed on the catalyst at high temperature (HR in the nomenclature of Hall and LoJacono), Engelhardt suggested [I5] that sites for metathesis must be different frown those required for the other reactions or, if tire same surface sites are used, the transformation of molybdenum alkyl to the molybdenum carbene internnediatF~ must be hindered by the adsorbed hydrogen. Our recent studies [7, 9, 10] of the isomerization of n-butenes led us to recognize some amazing changes which may occur in the character of molybdena-aiumina catalysts. Over the freshly oxidized catslyst the isomerization was found to be proton catalyzed; metathesis was not observed [7] . When the cataiyst was contacted with the reactant for a few minutes at 30 C, some reduction occurred concomitant with initiation of metathesis activity and the cis-trans transformation of 2-butenes then proceeded partly via metathesis. Similar induction of metathesis activity has been describe-d by 01sthoorn 2t al. [ lo, 17 ] . Parallel with the increasing metathesis activity, the acidic character of the catalyst, and consequently the conversion of butenes via an acidic mechanism, decreased. After further exposure to butene, the cis-trans isomerization proceeded almost exclusively via metathesis with neither intermolecular hydrogen scrambling nor isomerization through carbonium ion or alkyi intermediates. Thus, the selectivity for a given metathesis reaction may be increased. Over molybdena-alumina catalysts pre-reduced with hydrogen [10], metathesis activity was observed initially, but in the early stage of the reaction the cis-traps transformation by isomerization was faster. The latter reaction proceeded by a hydride insertion mechanism via alkyl intermediate, and was accompanied by extensive H/D scrambling [10] . As time elapsed the participation of metathesis in ..he cis-trans transformation of 2-butenes increased, but the contribution of isomerization via alkyl intermediate remained substantial. It is the intent of this paper to shed some light on how the isomerization via carbonium ion and alkyl intermediates and the rietathesis reaction are affected by varying the extent of reduction of the molybdena-alumina cats' i st. Experimental method Catalyst The same molybdena alumina catalyst (8 wt.% Mo) as in the previous works [7 - ZO] was used, prepared by the incipient wetness technique. The y-alumina was Ketjen CK-300 having a surface area of 192 m2/g. The experiments were carried out, using the same charge of catalyst after regeneration. It was calcined before each experiment in flowing dry oxygen overnight at 500 C; this was followed by evacuation for 30 min at the same temperature. 175 It was then reduced with flowing ultra-pure hydrogen (60 cm3/min) at atmospheric pressure and 500 C and the extent of reduction controlled by varying the time of this pretreatment. The final step was evacuation at 500 C for I h. The reproducibility was about 5%. Reagents Cis-2-butene was Matheson C.P. grade; before use, it was outgassed repeatedly after freezing with liquid nitrogen and then distilled from a vessel cooled with dry ice in acetone. Cis-2-butene-dg was separated and purified from a mixture of n-butenes-i8 (38 atom% B) supplied by Merck. Procedure Isomerization experiments were carried out in an all-glass microcatalytic pulse system using 0.05 g catalyst (2.5 X 1019 Mo). Pulses containing about I X 1019 molecules of cis-2-butene-do + dg were injected into a purified helium stream flowing at 60 cm3/min through the reactor. The products emerging from the catalyst at 60 C were collected for 5 min in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and then flushed onto a gas chromatographic column (4 m) containing Chromosorb-P coated with 20% dibenzylamine at 0 C; thermal conductivity was used for detection. The individual separated compounds were again collected in traps cooled with liquid nitrogen. Mass spectrometric analysis of these compounds was carried out using low ionization voltage (11 eV) to minimize fragmentation. Blank experiments showed that the procedures used did not affect the results obtained. The degree of reduction of the catalyst was determined by re-oxidation in an all-glass recirculation system. Aliquots of catalyst (0.5 g) were reduced in flowing HZ as described above. The water formed was collected in a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen and measured volumetrically at the end of the reduction. After reduction and evacuation, the reactor containing the catalyst was attached to the circulation system where measured amounts of dry oxygen were pumped through the catalyst at 500 C and a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen for I h at about 200 torr pressure. Results Reduction The extent of reduction with time in flouring ultra-pure HZ at 500 C is shown in Fig. 1. In the first few minutes the increase was so rapid that below e/Mo ^- 0.9 it was impossible to reproduce the data exactly. Above about e/Mo = I however, linear variation was obtained between the extent and time of reduction. Water was produced during reduction creating anion vacancies (0 ); hydrogen atoms (Hi) were also chemisorbed irreversibly as OfT groups [4.1 . The degree of reduction was defined by Hall arid LoJacono [lj ,s e/Mo = 4(OZ)/Mo = 20 /Mo + (HF)/info (1) where (OZ) is the oxygen consumption on re-oxidation. 176 1.e 1.s o _ _ _o 1_4 O 1.2 H l.a 0 uA 0_e a z ui r x 0.4 W 0.2 0 0 20 C s0 60 100 120 TIME IN FLOWING H,, MINUTES Fig. 1.

Conditions o_ reduction are given in Fig- ? _ The variations in the number of anion vacancies and the sites with irreversibly-held hydrogen are shown in Fig. 2. These data resemble, but differ significantly from those reported earlier [1j. While the amount of irreversibly-held hydrogen was nearly constant, the anion vacancy concentration increased linearly, but intercepted the abscissa at about e/Mo = E?.3; clearly the natu?e of these results is dependent upon the details of the reduction procedure. Using the present flow method, the reduction was so fast that virtually no HZO was removed from the catalvst in the first minute or so (no vacancies were formed below a/Mo = 0.3). 177 cetalysl-c isomeri.zation of a 1:1 aixture of cis-2-buteneO and cis-2-butene--ig was studied using a microcatalytic pulse system. Or the second pulse, the catalyst was contacted with the reaction mixture (initial pressure 200 torr) at 60 C for 10 min. Or this treatment, and between pulses, the catalyst was flushed with ultra-pure helium for approximately 1 h. The data obtained over the catalyst reduced for I min (e/Mo ,~. 0.4) and for 2 h (e Mo -. 1.7), the two extreme conditions studied, are collected in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Both the extent of isomerization and the intermolecular hydrogen-deuterium scrambling increased with reduction. The maxima at d in the traps-2-butene distribution data for all experiments is a significant indicator and a rough measure of the extent of metathesis. Besides isomers of 1-butene, propene and pentene as well as insignificant amounts of n-butane were observed. The latter occurred only in first pulses with catalysts reduced to a/Mo > 1; the butane could have been produced by hydrogenation with adsorbed hydrogen incompletely removed by evacuation for I h at 500 C. Propene and pentene can be accounted for as the products of efficient cross-metathesis between 2-butenes and the product 1-butene. The amount of pentene observed by gas chromatography was found to be smaller than that of the propene (possibly because of greater retention by the catalyst); consequently, it was not determined quantitatively.

The total isomerization w as, however, accompanied by extensive hydrogen scrambling. This is clearly evzdent in Fig. 4, where the deuteriurrl. distributions .are plotted for the product cis-2-buterte and traps-2-butene. These data stggest that cist>arxs as well zs double-bond isomerization are occuring concomiiantly uia a stepwise intermolecular process. The exact determination athe.fraction of isomers produced uia metathesis was not possible from t_he avaiiabIe data. Most of the d4 species cars be considered to result am metathesis between CcHg and CODs molecules, but certain paris od3 and ds species could also have resulted from meiathesis with previously or subsequently isomerized or 181 exchanged molecules. Consequently, to assess the effects of reduction on the relative importance of these processes, an estimate was made in the following way. The total d -species was assumed to be formed by metathesis and this amount was doubled. The tota metathesis product is twice the amount of the d4 species because the expected ratio of da:d :de from an equim.olar mixture of ccs-CEHg with cis-C Dg is 1:2:1. Values for the number of product molecules produced by metathesis were calculated in this way and are listed in the last two columns of Tables 1 and 2 (see footnote bj. . _~O -_-MZTEE R MET&;,._-.- . 1RM -=-IUTFJE 7 GE7 17f~ ELI = u 16 LU O O B J c 0 m % - us f Y6 J 7 li m W O O C r R 1S 7 O to Q x i m / / / . , Z _ ~ c O 0 os o_s o .s O'S ,.o ,s 1_s ,.s i.s EXTENT OF REDUCTION (affil.

The variation in the product button from tire first pulses of cis-2- buteneO and cis-2-butene-dg over molybdena-alumina catalysts with extents of reduction are shown in Fig. 5. The amount of 1-butene plotted is the total amount of 1-butene which was formed. The amounts of products of metathesis in cis-2-butene and traps-2-butene were calculated as described above. The non-met2thesis part of trans-2-butene was obtained by differences between the total amount of trams-2-butene (determined by gas chromat ography) and that calculated to be a product of metathesis. The metathesis activity was essentially constant with the extent of reduction. The only exception was with the unreduced catalyst, over which metathesir did not take place [?1 . The method used for the estimation of the amounts of products formed uia metathesis did not permit far-reaching conclusions, but the change in the selectivity with the extent of reduction is obvious. At lower extents of reduction about equal amounts of cis- and traps-2-butene were produced by. isomerization and by metathesis, .while at higher extent of reduction the relative amount of aetathesis product decreased significantly. 182 Cs e e 0 c T ? w r / --S 7 TS O o m J 7 U W J 0 LI. 2 C W O 0 f 1 ~ ' 1 1 ~ f f f~ 0 o.z o~. -as o_e f_o ~-2 1.e 1_s 1.e EXTENT OF REDUCTION (a/Ma) Fig. 6.

The way the amounts oI-butene and the non-metathetic part otrans2-butene changed with reduction were closely similar. At lower extents oreduction, the amount of irans-2-butene formed by metathesis was about equal to that formed via non-metathesis; at higher extents of reduction, the contribution ornetathesis to the cis-trans transformation became less and less. Over unreduced catalyst, the ratio of traces-2-butene/I-buiene was 2.6, while in the case of any of the reduced catalyst this ratio was more than 7. The produce distribution in the second pulse (Fig. 6) presents a somewhat different picture than that of the first pu>Se. The change in the total amount of I-butene with the degree of reduction was essentially the same as in the first pulse, but the non-metathesis par'. of trans-2-butene was relatively less, and over any reduced catalyst about 5090 of the franc-2-butene was formed via metathesis. The product distributions from the second and third poises (Fig. 7) were not significantly different, Le., the character othe catalyst was not c;ianged much by treatment with olefin. The amount oeach component formed in the third pulse was somewhat lower than in the second pulse, presumably because of same deactivation by polymerization obut8nes. The data for the metathesis products produced ever the unreduced catalyst after treatment with butene, when fitted to the data of Fig. 7 (points with flags), fell at a/hio = 0.5 - 0.6, suggesting that the catalyst was reduced to this extent by the butene treatment. This value is close to that estimated from the EPR spin concentration for 1VIo\"s for oxidized catalysts following this treatment [7] . As in the second pulse, the -2-buiene formed uta meta thesis and via non-metathesis was about equimolar and depended on the degree oreduction in the same way. 952 9 o 5,ma12 a K O h ro O !D O n rn Z, O 2 g '0 r. ssa4 4~., a a o.P g c0 p ss' ~ n ~ a'.Z ~, c'r Q' c G,1, (D f.0~\"- '< O cr 0 fD n P, (D n cr 51 m O n, ~\" fD w 'n a *- p, ~ n n s.1 <~zQ ,0 &1 o ob $5 OO 0 ~ ff, 4 o0 pix`h 5 c1 ` 5x O D(D D~L~~0Rl(D O O ~. o '0 :\" (Dra , w A. v ,r rMa b h ~P ~n ~nlcn-hm h V ~ \"0 h~ ~ 0 (P n 20 .o o.m-g n a p.

Sample size: 1.04 x 1019 molecules. Pulse of NO was sent through the catalyst at 60 C. Discussion Over unreduced molybdena-alumina catalysts, metathesis of cis-2butene was not observed; it appeared only after the catalyst had been contacted with gaseous reactant for several minutes [7j .This treatment reduced the catalyst slightly, as evidenced by darkening to chocolate brown and by the appearance of H20 [16, 17] and an EPR signal [7]. Over the catalyst pre-reduced with hydrogen, metathesis of cis-2-butane took place in the first pulse, showing that some reduction of the catalyst is helpful for metathesis. The amount of metathesis products. produced from the first pulse did not vary much with the extent of reduction (Fig. 5). This observation suggests. that the active carOne sites are formed on catalysts that are either reduced or unreduced, and that the number of these is not increased much by extensive reduction. Perhaps these are oxycarbenes [18) . The sites of higher coordinative unsaturation formed as the anion vacancy concentration increases (Fig. 2) do not seem to function effectively for this reaction. Perhaps they are dominated by the alkyl species required for isomerization, uid-- infra From Table 3 it can be seen that metathesis in the first pulse was not poisoned by NO. This demonstrates that metathesis occurs an sites other than those or- which NO chemisorbs. It has been shown previously [19) that only dinitrosyl species are formed, possibly along crystalline edges. The close resemblance of the change in the number of vacancies (Fig. 2) to the changes in the amounts of 1-butane and the non-metathefc part of trcns-2-butane in the first pulses (Fig. 5) with the extent of reduction, suggested that the isomerization of cis-2-butane takes place on these centers. 185 A consideration of t'te characteristics of the isomerization reaction over reduced catalysts led us to suggest [I0] that the isomerization mechanism involves alkyl intermediates produced by hydride insertion, in agreement with Tanaka and Okuhara Q] . It was therefore not surprising that both Ibutene and the non-metathetic trues-2-burene formation were poisoned in the first pulse by NO trreatment. The data (Figs. 5 - 7) stow a decided increase in metathesis activity for the second and subsequent pulses over the first. Presumably this is due to the formation of carbene centers from butene remaining chemisorbed on the catalyst from the first pulse. It is therefore significant (Table 3) that this enhancement is lost when the catalyst is pre-poisoned with NO. Evidently carbenes may be formed on sites which chemisorb NO and on sites which do not- As pointed out previously [7], there are several routes to carbene formation on these catalysts. These can be either reductive or oxidative. The latter are lost when the catalyst is poisoned by NO.

The metathesis and isomerization of n-butenes on a molybdena-alumina (8 wt% Mo) catalyst of different extents of reduction were investigated using the microcatalytic pulse technique. The maxima in concentration which appeared at trans-2-butene-d4 formed from the reaction of equimolar mixtures of cis-C4H8 and cis-C4D8 provided a measure of the extent of metathesis in the overall isomerization process. The conversion of cis- to trans-2-butene via metathesis was nearly independent of the extent of reduction for all reduced catalysts. Non-metathetic double bond isomerization, including cis to trans-interconversion, increased with reduction, but the 1-butene produced was efficiently converted to propene by cross metathesis with the cis-2-butene reactant, especially after the first pulse had been passed. Highest selectivity for a given metathesis reaction between two olefins is obtained for very slightly reduced catalysts. References 1 W.K. Hall M. LoJacono G.C. Bond P.B. Wells F.C.
