Facile fabrication of non-noble electrocatalysis with precisely tunned active centers for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are intriguing yet still challenging. Herein, an iron porphyrin-ferrocene conjugated microporous polymer (FeCMP) with isolated Fe centers was used as precursor to fabricate Fe-Nx electrocatalyst. Innovatively, NaSCN as both an active site protectant and a heteroatomic dopant was introduced. Subsequent carbonization at 800℃ for FeCMP mixed with NaSCN resulted in the formation of highly isolated Fe with S- and N-doped porous carbon (FeSNC800), which acts as a bifunctional catalyst with good ORR (E1/2 = 0.88 V) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction, η10 = 0.34 V) performance. The assembled Zinc-air battery possesses 118 mW cm−2 of power density and is stable over 300 cycles. This work highlights the strength of rational designed polymer precursor and heteroatom doping in controlled pyrolysis of platinum group-free electrocatalysts.

[1] However, the four-electron included oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) limit their practical applications. To overcome the sluggish kinetics and enhance the activity, noble metal (Pt, Ru, etc.) based electrocatalysts are widely applied. Considering low abundance and high cost of noble-metal-based electrocatalysts, reducing the size of active sites from nanoparticles to nanoclusters and even single-atomic catalysts is an effective way to reduce the usage of metal and promote the reactivity per site [2,3]. On the other hand, developing transitional-metal-based electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic performances that can be comparable with the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts is key to resolve the dilemma. [4]. So far, various strategies have been applied in the synthesis of site-isolated transitional-metal-based electrocatalysts. Using metal porphyrins as monomers which could stabilize the metal center by the M-N4 coordination [5,6], porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, have been fabricated to help enhance the electroactivity because of the richness in active sites and highly programmed structure [7,8]. Through rational design, the M-Nx active sites with late transitional metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, etc.) were orderly isolated, which showed activity exceeding metal nanoparticles and comparable with noble metal [9,10]. Furthermore, to improve conductivity and promote the electron transfer of active sites, additional pyrolysis process is always included, which ends in isolated M-Nx active sites derived from metal porphyrin/phthalocyanines [11,12]. Since developed in early 2010 s, porphyrin based porous organic polymers (POPs) or conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) as precursor to synthesize ORR electrocatalysts have flourished with much work reported, which easily disperse and anchor metals via coordination interaction, greatly reducing the loading of metal and enhancing activity [9,13,14]. However, rational design and control synthesis of atomically dispersed electrocatalysts are still challenging. A normal approach is to mix metalloporphyrins with metal-free porphyrins in the polymer precursor, increasing the distance between metals, which in return sacrifices the sites density and activity to some extend [15–17]. Moreover, the realistic application of POPs is also restricted by their low conductivity, in which pyrolysis is a basic solution [18]. Thus, careful selection of monomer and construction of porphyrin-based polymers as precursors, while adding modulators to improve conductivity and dispersity of metals, offer great opportunities for the exploration of next-generation noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Ferrocene as one of the first reported organometallic compounds, the study on which and its congeners had led to the dawn of organometallic chemistry and the award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973. [19] Due to the superior redox activity, ferrocene was covalently linked with porphyrin, which showed original photophysical and charge separation properties [20,21]. In 2014, Kadish and coworkers used ferrocene-substituted Co-porphyrin as molecular catalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide from dioxygen. [22] Yet, the ferrocene groups mainly impede dimerization of porphyrin due to the bulkiness and not take part in the reaction. More recently, Zhou et al. reported highly efficient ORR catalyst derived from ferrocene-based POPs. [23] The pyrolyzed catalysts possess both Fe-Nx and Fe3C active species, resulting in ORR activity better than Pt/C. However, the presence of Fe3C nanoparticles have lowered the atomic utilization, in which an alternative strategy is expected to create isolated Fe based catalyst. In this work, efficient electrocatalyst with highly dispersed Fe-Nx active sites was synthesized by pyrolysis at an optimized temperature of 800℃ for an iron porphyrin-ferrocene based CMP (FeCMP) mixed with NaSCN. Innovatively, NaSCN was introduced to the FeCMP precursor prior to pyrolysis, which performed as both an active site protectant and a heteroatomic dopant through the axial coordination with Fe-N4 units to regulator of Fe sites. [24] In light of the adequate iron active sites, the afforded FeSNC800 could act as a bifunctional catalyst with good ORR (E1/2 = 0.88 V) and OER performance (η10 = 0.34 V). The assembled ZAB using FeSNC800 also showed power density of 118 mW cm−2 and open circuit potential of 1.50 V. This work sets up a paradigm for rational design of a novel polymer precursor by using functional metalloporphyrin and ferrocene monomer as the building blocks to isolate and protect Fe active site and using NaSCN as modulator, leading to remarkable improved the dispersity of the active sites and conductivity of the resulting catalyst and thus satisfying electrocatalytic performance. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Experimental section 2.1.1 Synthesis of FeCMP precursor and the FeCMP-derived carbon-based catalysts Scheme 1 schematically illustrates the approach to fabricate iron porphyrin covalent microporous polymer (FeCMP) and the derived carbon-based catalysts including FeNC800 and FeSNC800. Polymer precursor tetra(p-bromophenyl)porphyrin iron (FeTBPP) was synthesized according to the published procedures [25] and metal-free H2TBPP was characterized by 1H NMR (S1.1, ESI), as detailed in the Experimental section of Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI). FeCMP is prepared through Yamamoto coupling reaction of FeTBPP and FcBr (1,1′-dibromoferrocene) two monomers catalyzed by Ni(COD)2 followed previous method [26], as detailed in the Experimental section (S1.2, ESI). Thermal treatment of FeCMP under various temperature of 600, 800 and 900℃ afforded Fe-N-C catalysts, denoted as FeNC600, FeNC800 and FeNC900, respectively (see S1.3 in ESI). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves, the corresponding Tafel plots, Nyquist plots and the electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in 0.1 M KOH solution for FeNC600, FeNC800 and FeNC900 all suggested the optimal carbonization temperature of 800℃, resulting in the best one of FeNC800 among them (see S1.4 and Figure S1 in ESI). Furthermore, alternative doping of NaSCN was carried out to get S heteroatom-doped FeSNC800 by pyrolysising the mixture of FeCMP and NaSCN at 800℃ in detail in the ESI (S1.5 in ESI). 2.2 Chemical characterization The synthesis routes of FeCMP and derived FeNC800 catalysts were shown in Scheme 1. The chemical structure of FeCMP was characterized by solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The CP/MAS 13C NMR spectra of FeCMP with assignment of the resonances were shown in Fig. 1 a 1b. The peak 1 and 2 proved the existence of ferrocene units in FeCMP, which was in agreement with the results of Okada et al. [27] The signal at 120.5 ppm (peak 4) could be assigned to the quaternary carbon of the benzene ring, which was linked to ferrocene units in FeCMP. Two peaks at 140.3 and 131.1 ppm (peak 4 and 5) could be ascribed to phenylene linkages and porphyrin skeleton of FeCMP. The signal at 151.3 ppm (peak 7) could be assigned to the carbons of CN in porphyrin macrocycles. FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1 c) revealed that the typical C-Br stretch vibration of FeTBPP and FcBr at 468 and 875 cm−1 respectively disappeared in FeCMP, indicating high polymerization efficiency. Characteristic absorption band of bi-substituted ferrocene were observed at ∼1001 cm−1, and the peaks at ∼1395 cm−1 were attributed to CC stretching vibration in Fc rings, confirming the presence of ferrocene ligand. The absorption at ∼3027 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of unsaturated C–H bonds from phenyl and ferrocene units. Furthermore, the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm of FeCMP showed the hierarchical porous nature with coexistence of micropore and mesopore around 1.7 and 4.0 nm and BET surface area of 450 m3/g (Fig. 1 d). These results suggested that the FeCMP was successfully synthesized in accordance with the expected chemical structures. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images for FeCMP and its pyrolysis product FeNC800 show similar sheet-like morphology (Figure S2), which indicates the high stability of carbon skeleton of the FeCMP. However, by comparing the EDS elemental mapping of FeCMP and FeNC800 (Figure S3a -b), Fe-based nanoparticles were found in FeNC800, which reflected agglomeration due to high temperature pyrolysis of FeCMP. Thus, to further improve the stability and distribution of Fe center, stoichiometric NaSCN was added before pyrolysis (experimental detail in S1.3). The introduction of NaSCN into the FeCMP precursor not only enhanced the dispersity of metal sites but also greatly enlarged the porosity, as evidenced by EDS elemental mapping and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure S3c and Figure S4). The surface area is only 35.6 m2/g and all of micropores from FeCMP disappeared for FeNC800, showing average pore diameter of 13.5 nm. On the other hand, FeSNC800 shows surface area up to 400 m2/g with hierarchical porosity, in which mesoporosity at around 4.16 nm dominates (Figure S4b, Table S1). After introducing S heteroatom, the surface area of FeSNC800 is ten times larger than FeNC800 and comparable to FeCMP. The hierarchically porous structure with a much higher ratio of mesopores (75.4%) relative to micropores (24.6%) in FeSNC800 can facilitate mass transport and promote the utilization of active sites during ORR. [28,29] Furthermore, the interventional effect of S heteroatom was further assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of both FeCMP + NaSCN and FeCMP (Figure S5). TGA curves of FeCMP + NaSCN exhibited two separate weight loss. The first weight loss starting at 100℃ refers to the decompose of NaSCN (20 wt%) into S while the second between 350 and 600℃ with further weight loss of 51 wt% refers to the carbonation process of the precursor. Interestingly, both the weight loss (51 wt%) and starting carbonation temperature (350℃) after the introduction of NaSCN are different from those of FeCMP (32 wt% of weight loss and 460℃ of starting carbonation temperature), indicating that the introduction of NaSCN could create more porosity and defects under a relative low temperature. This agrees with the higher surface area of FeSNC800 revealed by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. The above mentioned results are expected to maximize the accessibility to the active sites and have positive contribution to both ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity. [30]. From XRD patterns of pyrolyzed samples (FeNC800 and FeSNC800), two broad peaks at around 25 and 43 °, corresponding to the (002) and (101) planes of the partially graphitized carbon, respectively [11] (Figure S6a). FeNC800 also exhibited three new diffractions at 2θ = 37.7, 45.0, and 49.1 degree, respectively, corresponding to the (210), (031), and (221) planes of Fe3C (JCPDS no. 35–0772), implying the formation of Fe3C nanoparticles in FeNC800. Interestingly, after sulfuration of the FeCMP precursor, the peaks from Fe3C nanoparticles disappeared in the XRD pattern of FeSNC800 due likely to the coordination effect of SCN- to Fe-N4 core in porphyrin units of the FeCMP that inhibited random agglomeration of iron species during high temperature pyrolysis, which match well with the SEM results. The Raman spectra analysis was also conducted to further study the structure of the catalysts (Figure S6b). The two pyrolyzed samples show typical D-band and G-band of carbon located at ca. 1300 and 1580 cm−1, respectively [11]. A higher intensity ratio of D-band versus G-band (AD/AG, normally used to represent the disorder level in graphene) is found for FeSCN800 (1.82) relative to FeNC800 (1.69), implying more defects formed after S introduction. Then we performed the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), where we found trapped nanoparticles in FeNC800 (Figure S7a , b). The lattice fringe was applied to calculate the interlayer displacing of 2.38 Å, matching the (210) plane of Fe3C and in agreement with XRD result. The presence of aggregation for both Fe and C is further confirmed in FeNC800 from Fe, C and N elemental mapping of FeNC800 by HRTEM (Figure S7c ). In good contrast, no crystalline phase is evidenced in FeSNC800 by both HRTEM and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images ( Fig. 2 a, b), meanwhile the iron sites are highly dispersed among the FeSNC800 with even N and S distribution from observation of elemental mapping of FeSNC800 (Fig. 2 c). Moreover, through the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrum (ICP-OES), the Fe weight ratio is up to 1.91 wt% in FeSNC800, greatly increased from 1.30 wt% in FeNC800 without S doping (Table S2) The S content in FeSNC800 analyzed by ICP is 2.41 wt%, which is comparable to Fe, indicating the stoichiometric relationship. Thus, the introducing NaSCN into the FeCMP protects the Fe-based sites and then ensures the high loading of Fe single atoms in the resultant FeSNC800. Doped sulfur also regulates the electronics of iron indirectly, which will be discussed in the following section. 2.3 Chemical states and coordination environment The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were carried out to elucidate the chemical states and bonding configuration of different elements, especially iron species. As shown in Figure S8a, C 1 s (284.7 eV), O 1 s (530.9 eV), N 1 s, (399.7 eV) and slightly Fe 2p (710.5 eV) are found in the full spectra, whereas trace S 2p (164.0 eV) appears in FeSNC800. The elemental contents measured by XPS and ICP are concluded in Table S2, in which the surface Fe ratio of FeNC800 (0.06 at%, or 0.27 wt%) and FeSNC800 (0.07 at% or 0.31 wt%) determined by XPS is slight lower than the respective bulk ratio by ICP mentioned above. This maybe ascribe to the demetallation of surface iron through acid rinsing and shielding effect of carbon shell to maintain inner iron species. [31] The C 1 s spectra of FeCMP displays peaks for sp3/sp2 C-C, CN and C-N, illustrating the porous polymer with aromatic porphyrin and ferrocene as monomer ( Fig. 3 a). Due to the similar electronegativity of S with C, C-N/C-S peak was found in C 1 s spectra of FeSNC800. [29] Significantly, the content of sp2 C at around 284.2 eV increased in the order of FeCMP (21 at%) < FeNC800 (32 at%) < FeSNC800 (42 at%), indicating great improvement on the conjugation degree of FeSNC800 upon pyrolysis combined with S doping (Table S3). [32] It also correlates with the promoted π- π* stacking at 291.4 eV and CN at around 287.5 eV for FeCMP, FeNC800, and FeSNC800. Meanwhile, N 1 s spectrum of both FeNC800 and FeSNC800 shows five deconvoluted peaks ascribed to pyridinic N (398.5 eV), Fe-Nx (399.5–399.8 eV), pyrrolic N (400.7–401.0 eV), graphitic N (401.5–401.8 eV) and oxidized N (404.7–404.8 eV). As shown in Fig. 3 b, their parent porous polymer FeCMP has only Fe-Nx (399.0 eV) and pyrrolic N (400.6 eV), which are assigned to iron porphyrin. [33] In Table S4, comparing N 1 s spectra of FeSNC800 with FeNC800, content of pyridinic-N increased from 26 at% (FeNC800) to 27 at% (FeSNC800), meanwhile, graphitic-N content increased from 15 at% to 16 at%. The above-mentioned N species can reduce the adsorption energy of O2 and increase the limiting current density of the ORR, which further facilitating ORR process. [34] Similarly, Fe-Nx content of FeSNC800 also increased from FeNC800 25–28 at%, indicating more exposed active sites after sulfidation. In Fe 2p spectrum, non-pyrolyzed FeCMP shows four main peaks at 708.0, 711.2, 720.7, and 724.4 eV, which correspond to Fe-C (ferrocene) and Fe-Nx (Fe-porphyrin) [35], respectively (Fig. 3 c). Significantly, the Fe-C species decreased in FeNC800 and completely disappeared in FeSNC800, implying Fe-Nx is the only Fe species presented in FeSNC800. Considering Fe-Nx as the real active sites [36], this successful formation and dispersed distribution of Fe-Nx species, in agreement with the XRD and HRTEM result, have boosted the ORR (vide infra). Note that although no direct Fe-S coordination is observed by XRD and XPS spectra, binding energy of both Fe 2p3/2 (710.8–711.5 eV), and Fe 2p1/2 (724.3–725.7 eV) has a positive shift from FeSNC800 to FeNC800, as shown in Table S5. The upper shift of Fe-Nx binding energy demonstrates the stronger donation to N, which indicates modulation of the electric structure of Fe after S doping. [37] It is beneficial for the ORR performance of FeSCN800. In addition, the S 2p spectrum of FeSCN800 observed at 163.9, 165.0, and 168.6 eV are mainly related to thiophene-like structures of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states, and S-Ox species, respectively (Fig. 3 d, Table S6), implying the successful incorporation of sulfur heteroatoms into carbon matrix after calcination. [38] Furthermore, doping of S introduces asymmetrical spin density, activating C atoms nearby that is expected to facilitate ORR process [39]. In all, both carbonization and S doping strategy have contributed to the enhanced conductivity and high dispersion of active site, which leads to the superior ORR electroactivity of FeSNC800. The chemical environment of iron sites is further characterized by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Fig. 3 e presents the XANES spectra of FeSNC800, FePc, Fe2O3 and Fe foil. The white line (WL) intensity of FeSNC800 is comparable to that of FePc, between Fe foil and Fe2O3, indicating a +2 oxidation state [11]. That is consistent with the XPS analysis results. The coordination environment is determined by k2-weighted Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra in Fig. 3 f, where the main peak at 1.5 Å in FeSNC800 could be attributed to the Fe-Nx coordination. [40] Moreover, no Fe-Fe coordination are found at 2.2 Å, indicating no sign of Fe agglomeration. The FT-EXAFS curves and fitting results are displayed in Figure S9 and Table S7. The Fe-Nx coordination number determined from EXAFS is 4. These findings support the presence of Fe-Nx coordination in FeSNC800. 2.4 Electrocatalytic performance for ORR The ORR activity of prepared samples was initially evaluated by LSV in 0.1 M KOH solution on glassy carbon electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4 a, FeNC800 exhibits higher activities with more positive shifts of onset and half-wave potentials (Eonset = 0.95 V, E1/2 = 0.85 V) than those of FeCMP (Eonset = 0.75 V, E1/2 = 0.72 V). Compared to those of FeCMP, the higher activity of Fe-Nx sites in FeNC800 and the formation of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N in the carbon matrix that generated positive charge around the sp2-hybridized carbon should response to improved ORR activity of FeNC800. The role of ferrocene polymer was further proved by control pyrolysis experiment (Figure S10), where the FeTBPP800 obtained from the pyrolyzed FeTBPP monomer at 800°C exhibits the E1/2 of 0.81 V, lower than ferrocene polymer derived catalyst FeNC800 (0.85 V). The enhanced activity of FeNC800 is attributed to the more accessible Fe sites (Fe-N/Fe-C) and promoted mass transfer [18,23]. After introduction of NaSCN to the FeCMP precursor, the electroactivity of FeSNC800 was greatly enhanced with onset potential of 0.99 V and half-wave potential of 0.88 V, outperforming both FeNC800 and the commercial Pt/C (Eonset = 0.97 V, E1/2 = 0.84 V). Meanwhile, Tafel slopes were calculated to test the reaction kinetics. A relatively small Tafel slope (80 mV dec−1) of FeSNC800 was observed compared to that of FeNC800 (89 mV dec−1) and FeCMP (111 mV dec−1), demonstrating a better electron transfer eﬃciency (Fig. 4 b). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements testify the decreased arc diameter in Nyquist plots in the order of FeSNC800 < FeNC800 < FeCMP (Fig. 4 c). The smallest charge/ mass transfer resistance of FeSNC800, in related with the highest porosity, illustrate the important role of NaSCN in enhancing microporosity. This in turn contributes to the higher ORR catalytic activity of FeSNC800. Furthermore, the electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is usually used to estimate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), was determined through the CV curves at various scan rates. As shown in Fig. 4 d, FeSNC800 possesses the Cdl of 7.69 mF cm−2, higher than FeNC800 (6.19 mF cm−2) and FeCMP (0.27 mF cm−2), suggesting the much more exposed surface reactive sites on the electrode, which provide a larger probability for increasing the catalytic activity during the ORR process [41,42]. To investigate the intrinsic electron/charge transport behaviors, LSV curves of FeSCN800, FeNC800 and FeCMP electrocatalysts at various rotation speeds and their Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots at diﬀerent potentials are shown in Fig. 4 e and Figure S11. The K–L plots disclose excellent linearity and near parallelism, suggesting the first-order reaction kinetics with respect to the concentration of dissolved oxygen for the ORR. The electron transfer number n per oxygen molecule for FeSNC800 was 3.94, close to the theoretical value of 4.00 for Pt/C, indicating an obvious 4e pathway for the ORR. While FeNC800 and FeCMP show a mixing process of 2e pathway and 4e pathway with calculated n value ranging from 3.71 to 3.86, over the potential range from 0.2 to 0.7 V (Figure S11 , inside). Similarly, through the Rotating Ring-disc Electrode (RRDE) test, H2O2 yield of FeSNC800 was below 3.0% in the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V, suggesting the desired four-electron ORR process (Fig. 4 f). Moreover, the pre-anchoring effect brought by the introduction of NaSCN to Fe-N4 units of the FeCMP precursor has also enhanced the stability of the resultant FeSNC800. In this regard, the chronoamperometric test of FeSNC800 measured at 0.8 V (vs RHE) maintains 91% original current density after 40,000 s, where commercial Pt/C only maintains 54% current (Fig. 4 g). A comprehensive study including XPS, XRD, TEM and elemental mapping was performed on the FeSNC800 after durability test. The XPS spectrum indicates retaining of chemical state, especially absence of new Fe species (Figure S8b -e). This is supported by PXRD and HAADF-STEM elemental mapping images, in which no agglomeration of Fe is found. TEM images indicate the maintaining of sheet-like morphology with no nanoparticle formed (Figure S12). Furthermore, after addition of methanol as interference, Pt/C showed obvious current density decline and could not return to the starting level, while FeSNC800 exhibited much better methanol tolerance (Fig. 4 h). To clarify the effect of Fe-Nx sites, the poisoning experiment was also carried out by adding 1 M NaSCN in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte because SCN- ions can adsorb onto metal catalytic sites and impair the ORR catalytic activity. [34] After SCN- injecting, the E1/2 of FeSNC800 significantly decreased from 0.88 to 0.84 V, and the current density also greatly decreased (Figure S13). This shows that Fe-Nx play an important role in the ORR. The FeSNC800 was then applied to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which show the lowest potential (1.57 V at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH) among all three catalysts in Fig. 4 i. The overpotential for FeSNC800 is 340 mV in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than commercial RuO2 in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the OER overpotential of FeSNC800 was compared with other reported M-N-C electrocatalysts, which show satisfying catalytic performance (Table S8 in SI). Furthermore, the stability plays a crucial role in the OER process, which are evaluated by two methods for FeSNC800, OER polarization curves of initial and after accelerated durability tests (ADTs), and i-t chronoamperometric measurement, respectively. As shown in Figure S14a -b, the OER potential only shifted positive 9 mV after 10 000 CV cycles, which is better than RuO2 (18 mV). Meanwhile, the i-t chronoamperometric response also demonstrates that the FeSNC800 catalyst maintains 78% of its initial current density after 20,000 s in Figure S14c, which is better than 58% of commercial RuO2. These all demonstrate the good stability of FeSNC800. The good activity and stability of FeSNC800 matched well with the features of both the stable chemical environment of the active sites (existed in highly dispersed Fe-Nx forms) and heteroatom doping (both N and S doping in the FeSNC800). On the basis of the superior electrocatalytic activity, the FeSNC800 was then applied in the assembly of Zn-air battery as the cathode. Two home-made Zn-air batteries were made with carbon paper containing catalyst ink from FeSNC800 or 20% Pt/C under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the Zn–air battery remained at 1.50 V for FeSNC800, higher than that of Pt/C (1.46 V). The discharging polarization and corresponding power density curves of FeSNC800 display a maximum power density of ca. 118 mW cm−2 at current density around 175 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5 b), higher than Pt/C (∼78 mW cm−2 at 119 mA cm−2) and among the best reported Zn–air batteries based on carbon materials (Table S9). More specifically, the Zn-air battery actuated by FeSNC800 showed similar discharge performance with Pt/C as catalyst in battery, but it had larger specific capacity of 915 mAh/g at 10 mA cm−2 than Pt/C (790 mAh/g) with the same loading of 1.0 mg cm−2 (Fig. 5 c). Furthermore, the cycling stability of afforded ZABs based on FeSNC800 was testified through employing galvanostatic discharging and charging at 10 mA cm−2, maintaining its voltage gap for 300 charge/discharge cycles (50 h) (Fig. 5 d). A negligible voltage change can be found in ZABs with FeSNC800 electrode compared with Pt/C + RuO2 mixture, revealing superior long-term durability of FeSNC800. 2.5 Mechanistic study According to the energy band theory, the energy band gap (Eg) between the conduction band (ECB) and valence band (EVB) could be one of the critical factors reflecting difficulty or facility of electron transfer process. A small value of Eg is beneficial to the electron transfer reaction dynamics [31]. Thus, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were conducted. As showed in Fig. 6 a, b, the work function (Φ) of FeSNC800 is 5.74 eV closer to Φ of Pt/C (5.65 eV) compared to that of FeNC800 (5.40 eV). Theoretically, the work function represents the energy required to move an electron from the material into the vacuum and energy difference between vacuum (Evac) and Fermi level (EF). As the Fermi level determines the surface electrostatic potential, similar EF of FeSNC800 (−5.74 eV) to the Pt (−5.65 eV)has a positive impact on the interfacial electron transfer with the oxygen intermediate, and thus on oxygen reduction [43]. This explains the comparable activity of FeSNC800 with Pt/C. Furthermore, through applying applied to UPS and DRS, EVB and ECB levels of FeSNC800 were calculated as −6.77 and −5.62 eV versus vacuum that are lower than those of FeNC800 (EVB = −6.24 eV, ECB = −4.79 eV), respectively Fig. 6 c-e, depending on electronegative S into the carbon matrix. The band gap decreased from 1.54 eV of FeNC800 to 1.15 eV of FeSNC800. Similar to other N-doped carbonaceous materials such as C3N4, semiconductivity is found in the two materials [44,45]. Also, as a semiconductive electrocatalysts (conductivity range between 10−8∼102 S/cm), [46] the EF of FeSNC800 is close to its ECB, illustrating classic n-type semiconductor and more electrons on the conduction band. Thus, the sulfur doping in the carbon regulates the electron structure of the whole material, enhancing conductivity and promoting electron transfer in the reaction [37,47] I-V measurements shows conductivity of FeNC800 as 1.28×10−2 S/cm, whereas conductivity is 33% higher for FeSNC800 (1.70×10−2 S/cm) (Figure S15). S doping on carbon framework was reported to enhance conjugation and conductivity, which contributes to the better electrocatalytic performance of FeSNC800. [48,49]. In all, the outstanding ORR/ZABs performance of FeSNC800 can be rationally ascribed to the following factors: 1) the high loading of iron from the original porphyrin-ferrocene polymer precursor acts as active ORR sites; 2) the abundant micro/mesoporous structure created by NaSCN in the FeCMP upon the pyrolysis; 3) the S doping alternates the electron conductivity of the catalyst, easing the electron transfer to intermediates as well as improve ORR kinetics. 3 Conclusion In summary, FeCMP derived carbon electrocatalysts were designed and synthesis based on the iron porphyrin and ferrocene monomer. Subsequent doping of NaSCN not only enlarges the pore but also regulates the surface electrostatic potential, improving ORR/ZABs performance akin to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In particular, the work function and semiconductive nature of catalysts were found to play an important role in the ORR electrocatalytic activity. We believe that this molecular precursor design as well as heteroatom doping can be extended to the design and optimization of other state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for energy transformation and storage purpose.

        "dc:description": "Facile fabrication of non-noble electrocatalysis with precisely tunned active centers for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are intriguing yet still challenging. Herein, an iron porphyrin-ferrocene conjugated microporous polymer (FeCMP) with isolated Fe centers was used as precursor to fabricate Fe-Nx electrocatalyst. Innovatively, NaSCN as both an active site protectant and a heteroatomic dopant was introduced. Subsequent carbonization at 800℃ for FeCMP mixed with NaSCN resulted in the formation of highly isolated Fe with S- and N-doped porous carbon (FeSNC800), which acts as a bifunctional catalyst with good ORR (E1/2 = 0.88 V) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction, η10 = 0.34 V) performance. The assembled Zinc-air battery possesses 118 mW cm−2 of power density and is stable over 300 cycles. This work highlights the strength of rational designed polymer precursor and heteroatom doping in controlled pyrolysis of platinum group-free electrocatalysts.",
