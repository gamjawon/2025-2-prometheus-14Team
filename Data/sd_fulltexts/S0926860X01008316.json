Tel.: +49-681-302-2422; fax: +49-681-302-2343 Combinatorial chemistry and high throughput experimentation are key words, which represent a new field of chemistry, where through systematic combination of building blocks or chemical elements large numbers of new compounds are generated, characterized and tested in an automated fashion. It contradicts the conventional one-at-a-time approach by allowing the highly parallelized or rapid sequential study of hundreds, even thousands of molecules or materials in a single experiment. It offers to save time and costs for research and development. High throughput experimentation is rapidly entering industrial laboratories, while academia still remains hesitant and even opposed. Keywords Catalysts Combinatorial New materials High-throughput 1 The demand for better catalysts and new materials Over 90% of the chemical production processes are based on one or more catalytic steps. The catalysts control selectivity and reaction rate. Better catalysts reduce production costs and waste production and help to save resources. The demand for better catalysts in all processes is unlimited and has never been satisfied by conventional methods. But new leads are rare and catalysis research ever circles around well known materials. Our standard of living depends on materials (solids with a function). New products, which are introduced with an ever-increasing rate, are based on new or improved materials. The industrial demand for new materials is unlimited. Light-weight structural materials for cars or buildings, more energy efficient light sources, intelligent window glass, stable colors, moisture transporting fabrics, scratch resistant or self cleaning surfaces, new catalysts for environmental protection, cars or chemical production, better and faster materials for microelectronic devices, better drugs, better electrodes or electrolytes for batteries or fuel cells, are just a few examples for present targets of materials research. The rate at which new materials and better catalysts are discovered, developed and brought to market not only decides about market shares, industrial survival and job situations, it directly affects the quality of live and economic growth. 2 Ease of discovery Already in 1970 Joseph J. Hanak, an industrial chemist at the RCA-Laboratories Princeton, New Jersey, wrote in an article [1] on more efficient ways to search for new superconductors: “the present approach to the search for new materials suffers from a chronic ailment, that of handling one sample at a time in the processes of synthesis, analysis and testing of properties. It is an expensive and time consuming approach, which prevents highly trained personnel from taking full advantage of its talents and keeps the tempo of discovery of new materials at a low level.” His message was not appreciated at his time. Times have changed, but still the conventional one-at-a-time approach is dominating materials research worldwide, although progress in computational strategies has been made. Once in a while, new materials or new properties are discovered, most often by serendipity, and then many research groups race for improvements. We are not trained in the discovery of new materials and up to now no technology to speed up discovery processes existed. We are educated for and very good in the marginal development of better materials, a slow and stepwise process. Scientific education and training are based on trial and error and the “one-at-a-time” mentality. A second important factor is the need for fast research success in academia and industry. To guarantee this success, even scientific research ever circles around the “improvement” of well known materials with well known properties. In many laboratories, the search for new materials is still based on individual testing of thousands of formulations or compounds based on well known or analogous materials, an approach chosen already at the beginning of the last century by the German chemists Alwin Mittasch, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch. These scientists searched 3 years and tested about 6500 substances to find a new and also the first catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen [2]. Even in the late 1980s J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alexander Müller at the IBM Laboratories in Zürich, Switzerland (Nobel Prize 1987) had to fall back to trial and error when they discovered mixed oxides as materials that become super conducting at the temperature of liquid nitrogen [3]. The conventional procedures to develop or discover new catalysts or materials have not changed much since then. Some of us may be convinced that there is not much to discover and most of the basic materials and catalysts have been discovered or are well known already, an opinion supported by the very slow rate of really new important discoveries. However, a brief look at the opportunities provided by the Periodic Table does tell differently. The possible number of organic molecules based on the known structural diversity of just the five elements carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen has been estimated [4] to 1063. Preparing only 1mg each a total mass of 1060 g would be obtained. The total mass of our sun is approximately 2×1033 g, the total mass of the known universe has been estimated to 1058 g, indicating that this limited organic library from just five elements is equivalent to 100 times the mass of the universe. If we now allow for 75 useful elements the possible chemical diversity clearly exceeds comprehension. If we compare this to the number of substances known today (18 million organic compounds 1mg each translate to just 18kg), it is almost negligible. Clearly, just based on this simple-minded considerations, there must be an infinite number of yet unknown materials and catalysts for any property we are interested in, the question is not their potential existence, but how to find them most efficiently. 3 Removing the bottle neck The conventional approach is expensive and inefficient. Combinatorial chemistry attempts to tackle this bottleneck. Instead of sequential “one-at-a-time” research cycles, large numbers of new or known components are synthesized in a parallel or automated sequential manner and investigated in parallel. However, reliable parallel or sequential techniques for the synthesis, characterization and performance analysis of new materials are by no means trivial. The preparation must be suitable to be performed automatically and synthesis procedures have to be tailored to robots. In the pharmaceutical industry combinatorial techniques, mostly performed in liquids, have already been perfected for drug discovery. Increasing investments in this technology signals confidence and success. Due to the high standard of combinatorial techniques the screening capabilities of a pharmaceutical company today are estimated to be in the range of 50 million substances per year [5]. In catalysis and materials research robot protocols for synthesis procedures in liquids are often straightforward. Heterogeneous reactions, however, such as powder impregnation or solid–liquid or solid–solid reactions requiring mixing, milling or grinding are more problematic. Since there is little control over the final structure of new samples (microstructure and composition) and due to the less sophisticated state of materials preparation compared to organic synthesis, the chance for discovery of new materials is much higher. Thus, each sample in freshly prepared libraries is not only screened for desired properties but also screened for characterization. Access to fast characterization methods is mandatory. Most materials properties—such as catalytic or sensing activity, electric, magnetic, optic or mechanic properties cannot be identified by a simple color change. Suitable characterization techniques have to be parallelized or have to be performed in sequence at high speed. In combinatorial chemistry three screening phases can be identified. In the primary screening phase a very large number of substances is prepared and investigated. The fast methods employed are not expected to provide high precision data; the main goal here is lead identification. High throughput syntheses and screens are not expected to provide information as reliable as conventional methods. Consequently it is necessary to confirm promising results in a secondary screening phase. In this phase II screening the synthesis is scaled up to laboratory scales and screening conditions are often highly parallelized conventional methods. The properties of lead samples discovered in primary screening are analyzed more thoroughly and the set of samples with the best relative performance is determined. In this phase the composition of the substances can be optimized and refined. Phase III should bring the new materials close to the market. It employs conventional synthesis and analysis methods. Testing is not high throughput, but still time and cost may be saved by parallelization. 4 Preparation of materials and catalyst libraries Reproducible rapid synthesis is an important factor for high throughput screening. The most general and also most equipment intensive method is the automated preparation of libraries by the combination of vapor deposition with intelligent masking. In this approach any desired stoichiometry can be generated by spatially resolved, sequential thin film deposition followed by appropriate annealing. The composition is controlled by film thickness (down to even submonolayer) and the short diffusion ranges of subnanometer thickness of the composite films results in rapid and efficient mixing of the layers at temperatures around 100°C. Further temperature increase may result in the formation of kinetically stable new phases. The first demonstration of such an approach was reported in 1995 in a search for new superconducting oxides by Peter Schultz and coworkers [6] and his group at the University of California Berkeley on a small library containing 128 discrete materials, prepared by spatially resolved deposition techniques (see Fig. 1 ). SYMYX Technologies in Santa Clara, California, have perfected this technique already in 1997, when they reported the search for new luminescent materials on three libraries containing over 25,000 discrete materials [7], which amounts to the number of substances screened in a year by a large pharmaceutical company just a decade ago. In such combinatorial studies, a strontium cerium oxide SrCeO4 has been discovered as a novel, blue luminescent material. For liquid phase synthesis others and we have developed a simple approach, the use of a synthesis robot and a library containing predefined positions in the form of little wells. This approach can be used for sol-gel synthesis, impregnation and precipitation. For impregnation the cavities of a library plate are filled with the support powder, either manually or automated. Suitable solutions of catalytically active elements are then dispensed onto the support by a pipetting robot. Then the solvent is evaporated and the remaining coating on the support is dried and calcined by standard procedures. Impregnations obtained may not be homogeneous and far from perfect, but sufficient for high throughput primary screening. Sol-gel synthesis of amorphous or crystalline materials is based on the low temperature hydrolysis and condensation of hydrolysable precursors, followed by drying and calcination procedures. Existing procedures include microporous or mesoporous materials or mixed oxides with homogenous distribution of the elements or with mixtures of nano to micrometer sized domains. In automated sol-gel synthesis a pipetting unit dispenses liquid or dissolved reagents into the cavities of a micro-reactor array (see Fig. 2 for set-up). The preparation of 200–800 different substances takes 1–3h with the robot. This method is sequential in nature, but the robot outperforms manual preparation in velocity and precision. Our robot can use up to 80 different starting solutions allowing the generation of diverse libraries. The bottleneck is the manual preparation of the reagent solutions and the writing of the pipetting code for the robot. After gelation the materials on the library are dried and calcined, which can take up to several days. Solvothermal synthesis involves crystallization out of solutions at high temperature and high pressure. Zeolites, a well known class of catalysts, are formed under hydrothermal conditions. For conventional hydrothermal synthesis the reagents are dissolved in water, placed into an autoclave and heated to temperatures around 200°C, resulting in a hydrothermal pressure around of about 1.5MPa. The time consuming and cumbersome procedure makes solvothermal synthesis very attractive for high throughput approaches, but also challenging in view of the conditions, high temperature, high pressure and mostly corrosive solutions. Multiautoclaves [8–10] for parallelized solvothermal synthesis permit the synthesis of up to 300 different materials directly on a substrate, e.g. a silicon wafer (see Fig. 3 ). After synthesis, crystallization, washing and drying, a product library is produced, which can be screened automatically for new structures by the use of a commercial micro-diffractometer. The synthesis of catalytic materials by automated techniques originally met broad skepticism. The catalytic activity of a material depends not only on chemical composition and atomic structure of the active site, it also depends on accessible surface and pore architecture, properties not known to be controllable by high throughput approaches. Often special post-treatment or work-up is required to provide the catalyst with the desired activity. Rapid high throughput preparation of a catalyst library is facile, when the synthesis is carried out directly on the library support. Work-up or post-treatment of the samples, such as milling or individual calcination may be impossible to perform, however, which points to severe limitations of library synthesis approaches. 5 High throughput screening Especially for primary high-throughput screening the choice of the appropriate analysis method should be dictated by the minimum information required for qualitative lead selection and by the reliability and robustness of the technique. For example, if a new catalyst is to be discovered the relative catalytic behavior should be accessed most simply, rather than screening for structure or other characteristics, which would not simplify the decision but rather lead to unnecessary data. This is in contrast to conventional studies where one attempts to obtain as much information as accurately as possible. To reduce analysis time through efficient high throughput screening, parallel and sequential strategies are applied. The screening data are obtained fastest with parallel measurements in which complete libraries are investigated at once. Contact-free imaging techniques are preferred. In general the time of analysis of these methods does not scale with the quantity of samples, but data-quality may. This is valid especially for all parallel methods, where two-dimensional arrays of detectors are used to simultaneously sample the signals from the library. Best known are video-imaging techniques, composed of arrays of light-sensitive detectors (pixels), which provide sample position by spatial resolution and associated property data by color coding techniques. When video-imaging techniques are applied pixel resolution of the video chip is limiting spatial resolution as well as data precision. The larger the library and the fewer the pixel density of the chip, the fewer detectors are associated to individual samples on the library, which in turn increases the absolute error. Therefore, compromises have to be made to maximize sample numbers and data-quality. The same applies to any two-dimensional array of conventional detectors. Such techniques, if not commercially available, can get very expensive (costs scale with the number of detectors) and complicated, as tens or even hundreds of detectors have to be monitored and controlled. In the visible range this has been applied to detect changes in optical appearance, such as luminescence or fluorescence, in searches for new inorganic phosphors [7]. Fluorescence indicators, commonly used in biological or organic applications for drug discovery, can also be applied in materials discovery. For example, better catalytic anodes have been discovered combinatorially with the help of a pH-sensitive fluorescence indicator [11]. Most chemical reactions produce or consume heat, consequently catalytic activity can be detected by measuring the change in sample temperature. IR-video-imaging is a very powerful and sensitive technique to visualize temperature changes. A fundamental problem has been the materials dependent differences in IR-emissivity and reflectivity, which readily mask small temperature differences due to heat of reactions. In order to utilize the high temperature sensitivity of IR-video chips for the detection of heats of reactions, every image has to be corrected for its emissivity and reflectivity properties before the actual screening experiment [12]. With this method whole catalyst libraries can be screened within 2–4h for heats of reaction at a given temperature. Libraries are placed in a reactor with an IR-transparent sapphire window, heated to reaction temperature and the IR-camera is corrected for emissivity and calibrated for the observed temperature range. Then the library is subjected to a feed gas flow and the reaction is monitored with the IR-camera, which, if catalytically active materials are present, will provide images such as the one shown in Fig. 4 . To further quantify the heat produced on the active samples the relative heat of reaction produced can be calculated by integration of the individual heat spots on the image. This provides useful additional information. Such integrated heats of reaction are presently used in our laboratory for decision making in lead selection and catalysts development. A major problem of IR-thermography is that signal intensity is related to total heat produced. The method, however, is also sensitive to parallel and sequential reactions such as total combustion, the heat of which indiscriminately adds to the signal intensity. The method therefore has to be used with care in selective reactions such as selective oxidations or hydrogenations. Other methods developed for high throughput screening are for example REMPI [13] (resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization) and parallel FTIR [14] (Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy). The other approach to higher analysis speed is the acceleration and automation of sequential analysis. Here analysis time scales directly with sample number, therefore fast methods have to be chosen or developed. Although this approach is slower than parallel sampling, it can be applied to many conventional techniques and, if automated, is often sufficient for the demanded analysis speed. Elemental analyses of samples can be obtained by a commercially available X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, originally developed for microinclusions of geological samples. The instrument allows automated sequential analysis of libraries with spatial resolution down to 100μm (see Fig. 5 ). With spatially resolved X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, the elemental composition of each material on a library can be identified. Such an X-ray beam focused to 100μm in diameter excites a small area in the sample and the fluorescence spectrum is detected by an energy dispersive detector. This method allows to analyze the elemental composition of a sample quantitatively in less than a minute. Microstructural information can be obtained by a commercially available microdiffractometer, again developed for geological microinclusions. The instrument allows the automated recording of diffraction patterns from libraries in reflective mode where, according to Bragg’s law, the angles of the reflections are typical for the crystal structure. It may be useful for the discovery of new crystalline structures or simply to check if a sample is amorphous or crystalline. The beam can be focused down to a diameter of 50μm so that small areas in a sample can be analyzed. Typically, sample analysis takes 1–10min. For selective catalytic reactions rapid information on the composition of reaction product mixtures is required with good spatial resolution. Mass spectrometry is a method of choice, but it has not been available with spatial resolution in the past. In 1999 a variety of spatially resolved or high throughput mass spectrometric methods have been reported [15,16]. Our approach is very pragmatic: by combining a simple gas analyzer (with mass range 1–200 atomic units) with the synthesis robot used for library synthesis, a low budget spatially resolved mass spectrometer became available [17]. The pipetting unit of the robot is exchanged by a capillary bundle holding a feed gas capillary and the inlet capillary of a conventional quadrupole mass spectrometer. Fig. 6 illustrates the principle, based on the conversion of the library into an array of microreactors. The capillary bundle is inserted sequentially into each compartment of the heated library (up to 600°C). The feed gas flow is directed onto the catalyst and the mass spectrometer samples and analyses a mixture of feed gas and products. In Fig. 7 typical results are presented for a model reaction of technical interest, the selective oxidation of propene (H2CCHCH3) with air. Shown are the selective oxidation products of interest: allyl alcohol, acroleine and benzene. The mass spectrometer samples for about 1min per library point. An average library plate with 300 samples is screened within half a day. The accumulated data about product specific activity and selectivity are far more extensive than with infrared thermography. Their manual evaluation would take up to several days. Software routines for an automated evaluation and graphical presentation of the results are essential in such high throughput screening techniques. 6 Data, data and even more data As has been shown, it is possible to screen a large number of samples within a short time and to collect a lot of information about different materials. A method like infrared thermography does not only generate pictures for every feed gas combination and temperature, but also for any time dependency of catalytic activity. A catalyst may deactivate rapidly with time due to poisoning or product inhibition or it may require additional time to improve performance. The amount of raw data generated in a short time easily exceeds our human comprehension. One complete experiment with our mass spectrometer on a library plate with 350 substances results in 1–2GB of raw uncompressed data. If printed, the tower of paper would be higher than 20m. Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues under the Seas amounts uncompressed to 1MB, a stack of only 2cm of paper. To compare the mass spectra or diffractograms of 350 different samples, 61,075 comparisons have to be executed. If the sample data from only 10 plates should be compared with each other, the number of comparisons boosts to over six millions. It is easy to overlook connections between experimental results and preparation parameters due to the large amount of data. Without the help of computers and sophisticated software these data cannot be analyzed in a reasonable time. Most of these data analysing tools do not exist yet and only the combined efforts of information technology and materials research will enable us to gain more insight into these complex relationships. Scientists in various areas have already been faced with the challenge, how to extract or visualize the important information from millions of data points. This problem is not new, it has been faced in the Internet, where the search machines—highly sophisticated mathematical tools—are capable of handling almost infinite amounts of text and extract the desired information in almost no time. The next challenge was faced in the human genome project and in combinatorial chemistry for drug discovery. Fascinating theoretical tools are being developed to tackle such problems. Data mining according to the Gartner Group at Stamford, Connecticut, is a process for discovering meaningful correlations, trends and patterns by analyzing large amounts of data. Data mining uses statistical techniques to look for patterns through association, clustering, neural networks, decision trees and new learning algorithms. Data mining is an interactive and iterative process requiring a hypothesis, which is then tested and refined until a clear decision can be made, for example to identify a new lead material. The human perception is especially powerful at spotting patterns or orders. This is harvested by visual data mining, which combines data mining techniques with new visualization technologies. These new tools promise a new way of extraction of non-obvious information from huge amounts of data. New correlations between structure or chemical composition and property or function of materials may become available and thus stimulate new conventional studies to improve our scientific understanding. 7 Conclusion Combinatorial chemistry is the first rational concept to tap the potential wealth of chemical diversity in a more systematic way. In addition to the drastic acceleration of screening experiments combinatorial approaches are especially powerful in materials and catalyst discovery. New materials, such as better anodes for methanol fuel cells, better catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation or new luminescent materials for better light sources have already been discovered and many others are bound to follow. At present the field is dominated by the development and testing of high throughput techniques [18]. Future emphasis will shift to discovery and development of new materials and catalysts and there integrated laboratories capable of proper data treatments are bound to be most successful. Combinatorial materials research is a multidisciplinary field, which entails chemistry, physics, engineering, robotics, and informatics. While industry pragmatically staffs its combinatorial laboratories with the necessary personnel, in academia these disciplines are separated; collaboration does not come naturally and interactions need to be supported and initiated. The future for combinatorial chemistry is bright: Exciting new materials and catalysts with superior properties are waiting to be discovered and through the help of sophisticated data analysis techniques new structure-activity relationships will be discovered, which in turn provides the information necessary for a better understanding.
