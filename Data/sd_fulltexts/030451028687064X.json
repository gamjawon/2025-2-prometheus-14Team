EFFECT AND ROLE OF LEWIS AND PROTONIC ACIDS AS PROMOTERS GIUSEPPE BRACA, ANNA MARIA RASPOLLI GALLETTI, GLAUCO SBRANA and FRANCO ZANNI Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Universitd di Pisa, Via Risorgimento 35, 5 6100 Pisa (Italy) (Received March 13, 1985 .accepted July 23, 1985) Summary Upon the addition of Lewis and protonic acids, promoters to rutheni- um carbonyl iodide catalysts ([Ru(CO)3l3]~), important effects are observed on the activity and selectivity of the hydrogenation, carbonylation and homologation reactions of methyl acetate. The improvement in selectivity to the valuable products acetic acid and ethyl acetate, and the decrease of the formation of hydrocarbons are related to the acceleration by Lewis acids of the alkyi migration-carbonyl insertion step of the process. The effect on the kinetics is related to the formation and maintenance in the catalytic solution of the hydrido species, HRu(CO)3l3, and to the availability of I~ involved in the activation of the substrates. Introduction Mechanistic investigations on the effect of Lewis and protonic acids on the methyl migration-carbon monoxide insertion reaction, a fundamental step in carbonylation reactions, have been frequently reported in the litera- ture employing manganese [1-3], iron [4, 5] and molybdenum [1] com- plexes. The very important kinetic effects observed, however, have not yet revealed experimental evidence for the catalytic processes, due to the dif- ficulty in discriminating between this step and several others which generally occur in the catalysis. lodide-carbonyl ruthenium catalysts are active in hydrogenation, car- bonylation and homologation (carbonylation + hydrogenation) reactions on oxygenated substrates [6-9]. The comparable activity for these various reactions seemed to offer the possibility to distinguish the promoting effect of Lewis and protonic acids from other effects. 0304-5102/86/$3.50 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 184 CH3COOCH3 + HRu(COUy ^ X ^0 ^ ^CO < ft^^ CH3C,+HRu(CO),I, CH 3Ru( CO LIy <===2- CH3CORu(COLIy <_ A -cc) yr\"1\" CH3CH20Ru(COLIy CH4 + HRu(CO),Iy CH3CH20H + HRu(COUy CHsCOOH A = OH, OR CH3COOC2H5 + H^O Scheme 1. General pathway for methyl acetate homologation. The CO + H2 ruthenium-catalyzed reaction with methyl acetate leading to methane, acetic and ethyl derivatives, which presumably involves alkyi and acyi intermediates (see Scheme 1) [10], has been chosen for this study because the catalytic effects of Lewis and protonic acids can be revealed by kinetic and selectivity data. Experimental section Materials Tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium(III), Ru(CsH702)3 [11] and diiodo- tetracarbonyl ruthenium(II), Ru(CO)4l2 [12], were prepared according to the literature procedures, starting from RuCl3 hydrate (Industrie Engelhard S.p-A.). CHaI, Znl2, Alls, BFa-etherate, SbClg (Merck); HI 57%, H:,!^ 99%, KI (C. Erba); Til4, Hgl2, HBF4 50% (Fluka) and HPF(, 56% (Aldrich) were used as received. Ti(OBu)(OAc)3 was prepared according to the procedure described by Solankie^a/. [13]. Methyl acetate and acetic acid (C. Erba) were used as received; tetra- hydrofuran was refluxed and distilled from LiAlH4; ether 18-crown-6 (Fluka product) was used as received. Apparatus, procedures and analysis The catalytic runs of methyl acetate carbonylation and homologation were carried out either in a 190 ml Hastelloy C rocking autoclave heated in a thermostatic oil bath (runs 1 -11 Table 1 and runs 16 - 21 Table 3) or in a one-liter Hastelloy reactor magnetically stirred and electrically heated, equipped with devices for collecting liquid and gas samples during the reac- tions (runs in Table 2). 186 The experimental details for carrying out the catalytic runs were as previously reported [8]. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of reaction products and infrared analysis were carried out as previously reported [10]. Selectivity values to any particular product are molar selectivities calculated as: (product, mol)(no. of methyl groups) ^(products, mol)(no. of methyl groups) Water and carbon dioxide were excluded as products; ethane was counted as a product with one methyl group. Interaction of Lewis and protonic acids with ruthenium species Reactions between Lewis and protonic acids and Ru(CO)4l2 were carried out by adding to an anhydrous THF solution (80 ml) of Ru( 00)412 (1 mmol) the Lewis or protonic acid (5-10 mmol) under a CO atmosphere. Complete disappearance of Ru(CO)4l2 bands (v(CO) bands at 2161, 2105, 2096 and 2066 cm\"1) and appearance of new bands in the region 2101 - 2020 cm~1 indicated the formation of ion pairs of the [Ru(CO)3l3]~ anion. Results Effect of Lewis acids The results obtained in a series of isochronous runs of CO + H^ reac- tions on methyl acetate in acetic acid solutions (AcOMe/AcOH: 1/1) carried out under typical reaction conditions for the ruthenium-catalyzed homologa- tion of esters [8] (ruthenium precursor Ru(acac)3; temperature 200 C;P 15 MPa; H2/CO 2/1; time 10 h) using different Lewis acids are summarized in Table 1. When the Lewis acid was an iodide derivative, no further iodide promoter was added; otherwise KI or CHsI was used as the iodide supplier. By comparison with the standard experiments (runs 1 and 9) carried out under the same conditions without the Lewis acids, the following effects are observed: hard iodide Lewis acids (A1I3, Til4) significantly increase the reaction rate; borderline Lewis acids such as Znl2 or hard non-iodide acids such as BF3 or SbCl5 coupled with KI do not increase the reaction rate with respect to the standard runs; Hgl2 is reduced to metallic mercury; the addition to Lewis acids (i.e. to Al^) of a crown ether (18- crown-6) decreases the activity of the promoter toward the carbonylation steps of the reaction and increases the hydrogenation to ethyl derivatives and hydrocarbons (compare runs 3 and 4); the selectivity of the reaction seems to depend on the nature of the Lewis acid: aluminum and antimony derivatives favour the carbonylation 43 ^ 2J 0 'o '^.'2 i-lr-lO'-ICOtOOOO-^'N i-l E >* a,C u oiMTyoaotO-'^t^oi'^os a , , e i 0. !>> 3 lO ^'00 lllOOOOOC-OiC^^ t-> eg ^3 0 ^OO'sfGOC^OtOl^COtOlO t''\" 5 0) QC CDN-^lOt (OCDCOCOi-l &< -0 s \"5 ?,!

The promoting effect of the addition of All3 and the differences in the course of the reaction with respect to the systems with KI as promoter are clearly shown in Fig. 1, where the change with time of the liquid product composition is followed up to a methyl acetate conversion of 80%. The performances of the catalytic system in the presence of All3 are also summarized in Table 2. From these data it appears that: (i) activity: at a methyl acetate conversion of 50%, the TN, in the presence of All3, is about twice that observed with CH3I or KI; (ii) selectivity: All^ shows a selectivity effect intermediate between that of CH3I and KI, producing AcOEt and AcOH with about the same selec- tivity. Effect of non-complex ing protonic acids Different non-complexing protonic acids such as HB?4, HPFg and H3P04 coupled with CH3I or KI as iodide promoters have been added to the ruthenium catalyst (acid/Ru: 10 - 50/1) to test their effect on the course of the reaction. The results of a series of isochronous experiments carried out under typical reaction conditions are reported in Table 3. The presence of the proton acid modifies the course of the reaction in the sense that: 0 a w ;-j ~S co -^ c~ (-; 01 w. ^ TO (0 .-i d r- , , oo >o ^o c^ -^ ''44 II o TO TO co fe co ^ q ,_, ^ CT 10 '-3 0 IN C~ 0 TO TO r-l T-I 3C T-I co o o 10 o 10 \"^ + '3 t0 00 00 i-l <0 1~-' e 10 CT1 10 r-1 TO (N c 10 TO r-1 TO , S N I 0 a) '3 0 i-l 1~- TO C- \" 10 TO 0 00 IN , . 00 &~ TO^ rtll ^ ^-Ir-ITO _? ... l\" . r-1 <N ^ ^^ :5C<! t^O'^ll'-TO ^ <I, 10 TO [^ + ~0 TO 10 TO 00 TO IN a i-i o 10 to !f (N \"3 r-l [- 10 i-l TO (N , S IN r-l I u '3 ^ '!); r-i i-l M 0 tO 0 , TO , , 0 00 TO ^ ^ <0 (N I ^ I I ^ T|< Tf 10 ^ '1 9 lo ^ i~- TOQOTO 000 10N<N r-tWr-l TOQTO r-llOf^lO + ~0 00 (0 r^ 10 00 (0 a o> '-i t^ oo <N \" ^ IN .

In conclusion, the non-complexing protonic acids seem to have an effect analogous to, if less pronounced than, that of the hard Lewis acids on the catalytic activity. Generally, increasing acidity promotes the carbonyla- tion rather than the hydrogenation steps of the process. IR study of the interaction of Lewis and proton acids with the ruthenium catalysts In order to obtain information on the possible interactions of Lewis acids with the ruthenium tricarbonyl triiodide anion, [R^CC^^]\", the unique ruthenium species detected in the catalytic solution, we investigated, in various solvents, the IR spectra and the rate of formation of the metal anion from Ru(CO)4l2 in the presence of different Lewis and protonic acids (Fig. 2). Formation of both tight- and solvent-separated ion pairs between [Ru(CO)3l3]~ and alkaline or divalent cations, characterized by a pair of v(CO) bands at higher (2102 and 2033 cm\"1) and lower frequencies (2092 and 2021 cm\"1) respectively, has been observed when Ru(CO)4l2 was allowed to react with the corresponding iodides in different solvents [10]. When an iodide Lewis acid such as Alia or Til4 is used in THF, a very slow formation (about one week is necessary for a complete reaction) of a tight ion pair (v(CO): 2101, 2030 cm\"') is observed. Similar to the case of the alkaline iodides [10], the addition to the solution of small amounts of 18-crown-G ether results in an acceleration of the reaction rate (about 0.5 h for the complete transformation) and in the formation of a crown-separated ion pair (v(CO): 2093, 2020 cm\"1). In methyl acetate-acetic acid solutions (1/1), i.e. in the reaction medium of the homologation process, the simultaneous presence of both the tight- and the solvent-separated species is observed. The addition of 18-crown-6 ether to this solution increases the con- centration of the solvent (crown) separated species, as indicated by the presence of two pairs of v(CO) bands at 2098 and 2032, and 2080 and 2019 cm\"1 respectively. On other hand, when a non-iodide Lewis acid such as SbC^, BF3(etherate) is used together with KI, an IR spectrum analogous to that ob- tained in the absence of the Lewis acid is recorded. 191 ^ /\\ i 2092 2098 | 2028 2104 2037 nTHF<18 crown 6 in AcOH/AcOM* KI f\\ 2102 I 2033 inTHF KI/SbCI, KI/HPFg I 20: 2092 2100 2028 n AcOH/AcOMe Fig. 2. CO stretching frequencies (cm\"1) of [Ru(CO)3l3]~ solutions in the presence of different Lewis and protonic acids, The addition of an aqueous protonic acid, such as HPFe or HBF4, to the THF solution of the ion-pair K^R^CC^Ia]\" causes a variation in the IR spectrum, which becomes that characteristic of a solvent (water) separated ion pair (v(CO): 2092, 2021 cnT1). In conclusion, the IR study of the formation of [R^CC^^]\" from Ru(CO)4l2 in the presence of Lewis acids, and its interactions with the acids, leads to the following statements: iodide Lewis acids (Alia, TiLQ, like other inorganic iodide promoters (KI, Csl etc.), lead to the formation of ion pairs of the anion [Ru^C^Ia]\"; 192 with polyvalent cations the formation of the anion is slower than that ob- served with univalent or divalent iodides; addition of crown-ethers to the Lewis acids, due to their ability to complex the cations, facilitates the liberation of I~ and thus the formation of[Ru(CO)3l3:r; no particular interaction with the CO ligands of [Ru(CO)3l3] is observed, either with the iodide Lewis acids or with other hard Lewis acids such as BF3 and SbCIs. Discussion The role played by the Lewis acids in the catalysis of the carboxylic acid ester homologation depends on whether or not they are able to release I~. In the presence of A1I3 or Til4, a remarkable effect on both the kinetics and the selectivity of the reaction is observed. In the presence of BF3 or SbCl5, only the selectivity is clearly affected. The effect on the kinetics may be related to the formation and main- tenance in the catalytic solution of a hydrido ruthenium iodocarbonyl species (i.e. HRu(CO)3l3) and to the availability of free I~ necessary for the activation of the substrate, which seems to take place according to Scheme 2 [9].

Activation of methyl acetate by interaction of ion-pairs. Thus the highest reaction rates are observed with promoter systems which allow a high concentration of I~ in solution, A1I3/HI > A1I3 =:A1L|/18- crown-6 (runs 3, 4, 5, Table 1). In these systems I~ is directly added to the solution, or formed by a partial hydrolysis of A1I3 with water produced in the homologation reaction, or finally made available by a complexation with the crown ethers of the positive counter-ion of the iodide Lewis acid. No strict correlation can be drawn between the catalytic activity and the actual aluminum and titanium species present in the solution, because of the lack of direct spectroscopic data under the drastic reaction conditions (200 C, 20 MPa). The effect on selectivity, on the contrary, may be related to the direct intervention of the Lewis acid in the alkyi migration-carbonyl insertion step 193 CH3 CHi I I PH l3(CO)Ru-CO + BFa > l3(CO)Ru-CO- -BF3 > l3(CO)Ru-C^ 3 F\\ -0 F^F +CO 'I' HiO + CO ^CH3 HRu(CO)3l3 + CH3COOH + BF3 ^-2 l^CO^Ru-C ~^OBF3 Scheme 3. Lewis acid assisted evolution of alkyi and acyi ruthenium intermediates. of the reaction (Scheme 3). In fact, the interaction of the Lewis acids with the carbonyl oxygen and the stabilization of a metal acyl-Lewis acid complex may decrease the lifetime of the metal alkyi intermediate respon- sible for the hydrocarbon formation (Scheme 3) [1-5, 14]. Accordingly, a decrease of the selectivity to hydrocarbons occurs when the formation of acetic acid increases. This may be related just to the formation of the adduct Lewis acid-metal acyi [1-5], which may be more reactive toward a nucleo- philic attack of the carbon atom by water to give acetic acid [10]. The most effective promoter in this role is Sbds (72% selectivity to acetic acid). The promoting effect of the titanium compounds, added either as Til4 or as a non-iodide derivative, Ti(OBu)(OAc)3, is peculiar and different from that of other Lewis acids: these promoters in fact strongly favour the forma- tion of ethyl acetate. This may be related to the extraordinary capacity of titanium to form alcoholates and to exchange the alcoholate with a car- boxy late group [15]. Thus a rapid transfer of the ethoxy group from ruthenium to titanium, followed by a successive reaction with acetic acid, may result in an increase of the production of ethanol and then of ethyl acetate. Since the effect of non-complexing protonic acids on the rate of methyl migration-carbonyl insertion reactions is significantly less pro- nounced than that caused by strong Lewis acids [16], no significant effect of these promoters on the activity and selectivity of the homologation reac- tion has been observed. Only when HPF^ is coupled with KI, is a significant decrease of the selectivity to hydrocarbons and an increase of formation of useful products (AcOEt + AcOH) observed. Thus H\"1\" and K\"^ do make use of their Lewis acid properties in accelerating the carbonyl insertion step of the process (less hydrocarbons) and in favouring the nucleophilic attack of water on the metal acyi intermediate (more acetic acid).

The improvement in selectivity to the valuable products acetic acid and ethyl acetate, and the decrease of the formation of hydrocarbons are related to the acceleration by Lewis acids of the alkyl migration-carbonyl insertion step of the process. The effect on the kinetics is related to the formation and maintenance in the catalytic solution of the hydrido species, HRu(CO)3I3, and to the availability of I− involved in the activation of the substrates.
